    <p>ABI­LENE (Kansas) • Mr Mark Martin’s fam­ily res­tau­rant weath­ered two world wars, the Dust Bowl and the Great De­pres­sion, serv­ing up heap­ing plates of hand-bat­tered fried chicken, mashed pota­toes and creamed corn to a de­voted clien­tele.</p>
    <p>But it could not sur­vive the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The res­tau­rant closed per­ma­nently on Sept 25 af­ter strug­gling to break even amid shut­downs caused by the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“We’re kind of in shock that this will be the end of it for us,” said Mr Martin, the fourth gen­er­a­tion to run the Brookville Ho­tel, a name that reflects its ori­gins as a small ho­tel in nearby Brookville, Kansas, that his fam­ily ac­quired in 1894.</p>
    <p>The virus has up­ended travel and spend­ing habits for mil­lions of Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Small busi­ness fail­ures in the first months of the pan­demic were mod­est, how­ever, as fed­eral aid helped com­pa­nies make pay­rolls as they waited for life to re­turn to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>But the virus con­tin­ues to spread, shat­ter­ing records for new cases in the Mid­west last week, while emer­gency fed­eral aid is run­ning out.</p>
    <p>With cold weather and flu sea­son near­ing, which typ­i­cally brings a drop in busi­ness for restau­rants even in good years, Brookville’s fate may be a harbinger of things to come.</p>
    <p>Based on an anal­y­sis of credit card trans­ac­tions by on­line mar­ket­ing firm Wom­ply, one in five small busi­nesses i n the United States open at the begin­ning of this year had per­ma­nently stopped op­er­at­ing as of mid-Septem­ber – in­clud­ing 23 per cent of restau­rants.</p>
    <p>About 40 per cent of restau­rants re­cently sur­veyed by the Na­tional Restau­rants As­so­ci­a­tion say they will be out of busi­ness in six months un­less there is more fi­nan­cial re­lief from the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin, 70, was hope­ful in the first months of the pan­demic. The res­tau­rant se­cured a US$57,000 (S$77,500) loan through the fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s Pay­check Pro­tec­tion Pro­gram – a vi­tal life­line, he said.</p>
    <p>Three-quar­ters of that went to pay his sev­eral dozen em­ploy­ees, “which</p>
    <p>al­lowed us to free up those dol­lars to pay other ex­penses, like the mort­gage and gas bill – all the stuff a res­tau­rant needs”, he said.</p>
    <p>It re­opened on Easter week­end for take­out only and hit its goals: Two hun­dred meals on Satur­day and 400 on Easter it­self.</p>
    <p>Mother’s Day was a hit, with 700 take­out meals.</p>
    <p>It was even­tu­ally able to re­open the din­ing rooms, with lim­ited seat­ing. But busi­ness re­mained half the level of a year ago, Mr Martin said.</p>
    <p>Sum­mer is nor­mally the busy sea­son, thanks to a steady stream of vis­i­tors to the nearby Eisen­hower Pres­i­den­tial Li­brary and Mu­seum. Of­ten, Brookville would have two tour buses a week stop by for lunch or din­ner.</p>
    <p>But the mu­seum re­mains closed and it had just two buses all sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin cut costs ev­ery­where,</p>
    <p>in­clud­ing switch­ing to haul­ing the res­tau­rant’s garbage to the dump with his own trailer to shave the US$375 a month cost of pickup – but it was not enough.</p>
    <p>By the time it closed in Septem­ber, he es­ti­mates he had lost US$50,000 in to­tal for the year, com­pared with the up to $50,000 an­nual profit he was used to.</p>
    <p>He and his wife Con­nie re­built the res­tau­rant in Abi­lene in 2000, painstak­ingly mir­ror­ing the old ho­tel’s dis­tinc­tive look, with a round-roof fa­cade and the words “Since 1870” in large let­ters.</p>
    <p>His mort­gage stands at about US$700,000.</p>
    <p>There was no fifth gen­er­a­tion wait­ing to take over. The couple’s only child, daugh­ter Brandy Lea, died 25 years ago at age 17.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin has no plans to re­tire, in part as he has poured most of his</p>
    <p>sav­ings into the res­tau­rant, and just ap­plied for a courier job.</p>
    <p>The shut­down has rip­pled through the Abi­lene com­mu­nity, whose pop­u­la­tion num­bers 6,300.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim Palenske, a host­ess at the res­tau­rant, knew they were strug­gling but was still star­tled when Mr Martin de­cided to close.</p>
    <p>The res­tau­rant was so well known, she said, so she was sure it would sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers are also reeling. Ms Mary Stirtz and her hus­band, lo­cal re­tirees, would pick up din­ner al­most ev­ery warm Fri­day night and eat it at the nearby Eisen­hower Park.</p>
    <p>They cel­e­brated their 50th wed­ding an­niver­sary in the park two years ago with 35 din­ners from Brookville for fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>“We loved it,” she said. “We just loved it.”</p>
