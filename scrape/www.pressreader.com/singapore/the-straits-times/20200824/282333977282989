    <p>All it took to change Au­drey Yong’s life was a bronze medal she won in wind­surf­ing at the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in 2010.</p>
    <p>But it was not only the 25-yearold’s life that was trans­formed by her achieve­ment, but it also made an im­pact on her friend and fel­low surfer Ynez Lim.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, she was re­minded of this when she con­tacted Lim on her 22nd birth­day.</p>
    <p>“She said the bronze medal I won was so in­spir­ing to her as a 12-yearold, and that it started her jour­ney to the YOG,” Yong said.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the Games’ legacy, she added: “For wind­surf­ing, it cre­ated aware­ness of a sport that was rel­a­tively un­known here and I’d like to think that the YOG and its sub­se­quent edi­tions en­cour­aged more of the next gen­er­a­tion to try out wind­surf­ing.</p>
    <p>“For me, win­ning in your home coun­try is al­ways ex­tra spe­cial be­cause you see your friends and fam­ily, es­pe­cially those who have never seen how wind­surf­ing works in real life, come to sup­port you over the course of the com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>Lim was among those sup­port­ers in 2010, be­fore go­ing on to com­pete at the next edi­tion of the Games in Nan­jing in 2014. She re­called stand­ing in front of the mir­ror just months af­ter pick­ing up the sport, telling her­self: “You have the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing like Au­drey. She’s an in­spi­ra­tion and if she can do it, why can’t you?”</p>
    <p>For a novice ath­lete like Yong, the YOG bronze medal “launched” her sport­ing ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“I had been wind­surf­ing for only two years... to com­pete in such a big Games and the first one ever (held) was sur­real and I still do think about it some­times,” added Yong, who re­tired from wind­surf­ing in 2017 and is now a fi­nal-year stu­dent at the Singapore Man­age­ment Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Among the mem­o­ries from 2010 that stand out are a scav­enger hunt in the Games Vil­lage which al­lowed ath­letes to learn more about the cul­tures of dif­fer­ent coun­tries. She also re­mem­bers the feel­ing of “pure bliss” the day af­ter clinch­ing the medal.</p>
    <p>“When you do well in sport, it opens up op­por­tu­ni­ties like spon­sor­ship, and the YOG was a spring­board for that. A lot of the op­por­tu­ni­ties I got, (such as) de­fer­ring my stud­ies and trav­el­ling for sport, it all started be­cause of the YOG,” added Yong.</p>
    <p>“I also did the SEA Games, Asian Games and the Olympics and the YOG was re­ally that start­ing point and I’m very grate­ful. Get­ting that bronze re­ally did change my life.”</p>
