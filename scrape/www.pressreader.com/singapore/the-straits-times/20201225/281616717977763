    <p>With more vis­i­tors head­ing to the South­ern Is­lands and Pu­lau Ubin in re­cent months, more safe man­age­ment mea­sures have been put in place at the Ma­rina South Pier and Changi Point Ferry Ter­mi­nal, the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude de­ploy­ing safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors to re­mind vis­i­tors to stay suf­fi­ciently apart, set­ting up ded­i­cated queue lines for ar­eas with more traf­fic such as the de­par­ture wait­ing hall and jetty ar­eas, as well as in­creas­ing berth us­age at Ma­rina South Pier dur­ing the week­end peak pe­ri­ods to cater for the in­creased num­ber of ferry trips.</p>
    <p>This would al­le­vi­ate over­crowd­ing, given the larger num­ber of week­end pas­sen­gers de­part­ing for the South­ern Is­lands af­ter re­stric­tions on in­ter­na­tional travel kicked in due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>MPA also re­minded peo­ple who par­tic­i­pate in recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties at sea to be aware of the po­ten­tial dan­gers such as strong waves and cur­rents, deep drop-offs, un­der­wa­ter haz­ards and wa­ter­craft in the vicin­ity, not­ing re­cent in­ci­dents in­volv­ing vis­i­tors to the South­ern Is­lands.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, a 41-year-old man was found dead af­ter snorkellin­g alone near the Sis­ters’ Is­lands Marine Park. The man was re­port­edly with his fam­ily when he vis­ited the is­lands.</p>
    <p>Beach­go­ers should swim only in ar­eas manned by life­guards or within ar­eas marked for swim­ming, said MPA.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also in the midst of the mon­soon sea­son, which is ex­pected to end in early March.</p>
    <p>“Par­tic­u­larly, from De­cem­ber this year to early Jan­uary next year, mon­soon surges are ex­pected to cause wide­spread con­tin­u­ous mod­er­ate-to-heavy rain, with strong winds and choppy seas that can in­crease risks at sea,” said MPA, re­mind­ing port users and the pub­lic to stay safe at sea dur­ing the year-end hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of safety mea­sures have been put in place dur­ing this pe­riod, in­clud­ing checks by MPA in­spec­tors on fer­ries to en­sure that on-board fire­fight­ing and life-sav­ing ap­pli­ances are in good work­ing con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Ad­vi­sories have also been sent to own­ers and op­er­a­tors of port fa­cil­i­ties and fer­ries to stay alert for se­cu­rity threats, and to en­sure that ship crew are fa­mil­iar with safety mea­sures such as the lo­ca­tion of emer­gency ex­its.</p>
    <p>Con­trac­tors in­volved in marine projects such as the de­vel­op­ment of Tuas Port, as well as land recla­ma­tion at Tuas West Coast and Pu­lau Tekong, have been re­minded to ex­er­cise due dili­gence to pre­vent work­place ac­ci­dents.</p>
