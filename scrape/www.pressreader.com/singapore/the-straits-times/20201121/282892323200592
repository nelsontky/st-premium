    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK When Amer­i­can pres­i­dents leave of­fice, re­gard­less of their par­ties or ap­proval rat­ings, a com­mon rit­ual awaits: They write books, cap­tur­ing the mo­ment for his­tory and shar­ing in­sight into one of the world’s most un­usual jobs.</p>
    <p>But pub­lish­ers are at odds over such a project with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, even though his pres­i­den­tial mem­oir would likely sell mil­lions of copies. It is a de­bate that pits pow­er­ful com­mer­cial in­ter­ests against fraught po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural fault lines, with some ex­ec­u­tives wor­ried that sign­ing him would prompt a re­volt among their au­thors and staff, and that en­sur­ing the book’s verac­ity could be an even big­ger con­cern.</p>
    <p>“I would take a meet­ing,” said Ms Dana Canedy, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent and pub­lisher of Si­mon & Schus­ter’s name­sake im­print. “But there’s a huge gap be­tween tak­ing a meet­ing and pub­lish­ing a book.” Con­cen­trated in New York City, main­stream book pub­lish­ing is dom­i­nated by edi­tors, agents, pub­li­cists and other pro­fes­sion­als who are po­lit­i­cally left of cen­tre, but the big houses all sign books by con­ser­va­tives, see­ing it as key to their mis­sion and their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Fox News an­chor Sean Han­nity is at Si­mon & Schus­ter. For­mer press sec­re­tary Sarah San­ders is at Macmil­lan. For­mer House speaker Newt Gin­grich has been pub­lished by di­vi­sions of Pen­guin Ran­dom House, Ha­chette and Macmil­lan.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has pub­lished more than a dozen books, although some ti­tles have sold more than oth­ers. Ac­cord­ing to NPD BookS­can, Trump: The Best Golf Ad­vice I Ever Re­ceived has sold about 3,500 copies since it came out 15 years ago. The Art Of The Deal has sold more than 630,000 copies.</p>
    <p>Sales and prof­its this time around stand to be huge. Mr Trump was de­feated in this year’s elec­tion, but still has a mega­phone on so­cial me­dia and holds sway with many con­ser­va­tive me­dia out­lets, which will give him a plat­form to pro­mote his book even when he is out of of­fice. More than 73 mil­lion peo­ple voted for him this year.</p>
    <p>But the risks this time are dif­fer­ent too. Sev­eral top ex­ec­u­tives said that pub­lish­ing Mr Trump could be per­ilous in a po­larised me­dia en­vi­ron­ment – to a de­gree that is far dif­fer­ent from his books re­leased be­fore he be­came pres­i­dent – and that the pos­si­bil­i­ties of boy­cotts, li­bel law­suits and so­cial me­dia cam­paigns out­weighed the ob­vi­ous fi­nan­cial ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Ha­chette dropped a planned mem­oir by Woody Allen fol­low­ing protests by its em­ploy­ees and Allen’s son Ro­nan Far­row, an author who is also pub­lished by a Ha­chette im­print.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers noted that pub­lish­ers would face cred­i­bil­ity is­sues if they re­leased a book by a pub­lic fig­ure known for spread­ing false­hoods and mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Pub­lish­ers, who typ­i­cally rely on au­thors for fact-check­ing and ac­cu­racy, would likely need to take ad­di­tional steps to ver­ify that Mr Trump’s ac­count was fac­tual and that he would be will­ing to un­dergo that kind of re­view.</p>
    <p>“I’d have to be sat­is­fied that he met Si­mon & Schus­ter’s over­all stan­dards for pub­lish­ing a book, which is that book be hon­est, fair and bal­anced,” Ms Canedy said. “We’d want to know that he would be will­ing to be edited and sub­mit to a rig­or­ous fact-check­ing process.”</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion about Mr Trump’s plans for his mem­oir – which he has hinted at in the past – be­gan pick­ing up in the days af­ter the elec­tion. Though he does not yet ap­pear to be ac­tively shop­ping for one, his fi­nances are un­der stress and he could be look­ing for the type of cash in­fu­sion a book might bring.</p>
    <p>Most of the pres­i­dent’s busi­nesses are los­ing money, ac­cord­ing to an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by The New York Times, which ob­tained two decades of his cor­po­rate and per­sonal tax in­for­ma­tion. These tax records also show that he has hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in debt com­ing due in the next few years that he has per­son­ally guar­an­teed. He is also un­der au­dit by the In­ter­nal Rev­enue Ser­vice and an ad­verse rul­ing could cost him more than US$100 mil­lion (S$134 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Pres­i­den­tial mem­oirs have long been a pop­u­lar and lu­cra­tive sub­genre. Such books have a built-in au­di­ence and are gen­er­ally re­li­able mon­ey­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>But blow­back from within the in­dus­try to a Trump mem­oir, es­pe­cially as he re­fuses to con­cede that he lost the elec­tion, is likely to be se­vere.</p>
    <p>Ce­leste Ng, author of the best­selling novel Lit­tle Fires Ev­ery­where, said she would not hes­i­tate to speak out against her pub­lisher, Pen­guin Ran­dom House, if it struck a deal with Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“We have ev­ery rea­son to be­lieve a Trump mem­oir would be pri­mar­ily mis­in­for­ma­tion, un­grounded opin­ions and flat-out lies,” she said in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>Some prom­i­nent writ­ers who have been out­spo­ken crit­ics of the pres­i­dent said they would not ob­ject if a pub­lisher took on the project. Stephen King, who has fre­quently de­nounced Mr Trump on Twit­ter, said in an e-mail that Mr Trump should be given the op­por­tu­nity to re­lease his book as a mat­ter of prin­ci­ple.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing he wrote would be a pack of self-serv­ing lies, but I be­lieve in the free­dom of peo­ple to read what they want and I hate cen­sor­ship,” said King, who is one of Si­mon & Schus­ter’s top-sell­ing au­thors.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral top ex­ec­u­tives said that pub­lish­ing Mr Trump could be per­ilous in a po­larised me­dia en­vi­ron­ment ... and that the pos­si­bil­i­ties of boy­cotts, li­bel law­suits and so­cial me­dia cam­paigns out­weighed the ob­vi­ous fi­nan­cial ben­e­fits.</p>
