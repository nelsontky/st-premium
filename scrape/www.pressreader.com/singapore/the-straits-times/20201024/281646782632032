    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Gold­man Sachs Group yes­ter­day reached a deal to set­tle a probe into the bank’s role in Malaysia’s 1MDB cor­rup­tion scan­dal, which in­cluded to­tal penal­ties of nearly US$3 bil­lion (S$4.1 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The bank was in­ves­ti­gated for its role in rais­ing US$6.5 bil­lion in three bond sales be­tween 2012 and 2013 for the 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) state fund.</p>
    <p>HOW DID BIL­LIONS GO MISS­ING?</p>
    <p>1MDB is a state fund launched in 2009 by for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak to pro­mote eco­nomic devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>It raised bil­lions of dol­lars in bonds, os­ten­si­bly for in­vest­ment projects and joint ven­tures, be­tween 2009 and 2013.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian and United States au­thor­i­ties say US$4.5 bil­lion, in­clud­ing some of the money Gold­man helped raise, was stolen from 1MDB in an elab­o­rate scheme that spanned the globe and im­pli­cated high-level of­fi­cials of the fund, Na­jib and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The si­phoned funds were used to buy lux­ury as­sets and real es­tate, in­clud­ing ho­tels, a pri­vate jet, art by Pi­casso and Monet, and to fi­nance Hol­ly­wood films, US law­suits said.</p>
    <p>The US De­part­ment of Jus­tice has sought to re­cover about US$2.1 bil­lion in as­sets linked to di­verted 1MDB funds – the largest as­set re­cov­ery ac­tion brought by the agency.</p>
    <p>HOW IS GOLD­MAN SACHS IN­VOLVED?</p>
    <p>Gold­man has been in­ves­ti­gated by reg­u­la­tors in at least 14 coun­tries for its role in un­der­writ­ing the 1MDB bond is­sues.</p>
    <p>The work earned the bank US$600 mil­lion in fees and led to large bonuses for some of its ex­ec­u­tives, of­fi­cials have said, although the bank has dis­puted that fig­ure.</p>
    <p>The US Jus­tice De­part­ment said on Thurs­day that Gold­man vi­o­lated the US For­eign Cor­rupt Prac­tices Act that bans US firms from pay­ing for­eign gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials for help in get­ting or keep­ing busi­ness. Malaysian pros­e­cu­tors said the bank mis­led i nvestors over the bond sales.</p>
    <p>Gold­man has in the past said cer­tain mem­bers of the for­mer Malaysian gov­ern­ment and 1MDB of­fi­cials lied to it about how pro­ceeds from the bond sales would be used.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Gold­man’s Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to vi­o­lat­ing US for­eign bribery rules.</p>
    <p>HOW MUCH WILL GOLD­MAN PAY?</p>
    <p>Gold­man will make a US$2.3 bil­lion pay­ment to the US Jus­tice De­part­ment and other reg­u­la­tors, and a fur­ther US$600 mil­lion in dis­gorge­ment of ill-got­ten gains to set­tle the</p>
    <p>US probe and avoid a crim­i­nal con­vic­tion at the group level.</p>
    <p>This is on top of the US$3.9 bil­lion that Gold­man has agreed to pay Malaysia in ex­change for drop­ping all crim­i­nal charges against the bank.</p>
    <p>Gold­man’s Asia unit will also pay Hong Kong’s mar­kets watch­dog US$350 mil­lion for se­ri­ous lapses and de­fi­cien­cies in its man­age­ment</p>
    <p>con­trols that con­trib­uted to the mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of US$2.6 bil­lion in funds that it helped raise for 1MDB.</p>
    <p>ARE THERE ANY OTHER CASES AGAINST GOLD­MAN?</p>
    <p>The US Jus­tice De­part­ment has filed crim­i­nal charges against two for­mer Gold­man bankers tied to the scan­dal, Tim Leiss­ner and Roger Ng.</p>
    <p>Leiss­ner pleaded guilty to the charges in 2018, while Ng’s case is pend­ing in a New York court. Ng is ex­pected to face sep­a­rate charges in Malaysia af­ter his US trial con­cludes.</p>
    <p>This week, Abu Dhabi’s In­ter­na­tional Petroleum In­vest­ment Com­pany dropped a law­suit against Gold­man to re­cover losses suf­fered from the bank’s deal­ings with 1MDB.</p>
    <p>WHO ELSE HAS BEEN IM­PLI­CATED?</p>
    <p>Af­ter los­ing an elec­tion in 2018, Na­jib was charged with 42 crim­i­nal of­fences in Malaysia, mostly linked to losses at 1MDB and other state en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>In July, he was found guilty of cor­rup­tion and money laun­der­ing for il­le­gally re­ceiv­ing US$10 mil­lion from a for­mer 1MDB unit and sen­tenced to 12 years in prison. He de­nies wrong­do­ing and has filed an ap­peal.</p>
    <p>El­liott Broidy, a for­mer fundraiser for US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, pleaded guilty this week to a charge that he il­le­gally lob­bied Mr Trump to drop a probe into 1MDB.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian and the US au­thor­i­ties have also filed charges against Malaysian fi­nancier Jho Low over his al­leged cen­tral role in the 1MDB fraud. His where­abouts are un­known.</p>
