    <p>No coun­try has been spared the im­pacts of Covid-19, and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion is nec­es­sary to re­spond ef­fec­tively to the pan­demic and but­tress global eco­nomic re­cov­ery, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore will work with G-20 mem­bers to im­ple­ment the mea­sures to help our economies and busi­nesses re­cover as quickly as pos­si­ble,” he said dur­ing a vir­tual Group of 20 Trade and In­vest­ment Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing.</p>
    <p>At the meet­ing – the third and fi­nal one be­fore the G-20 Lead­ers’ Sum­mit in Novem­ber – trade and in­vest­ment min­is­ters of G-20 mem­bers and guest coun­tries en­dorsed the Trade and In­vest­ment Min­is­te­rial Com­mu­nique.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion out­lined the bloc’s com­mit­ment to sup­port­ing the re­cov­ery of in­ter­na­tional trade and in­vest­ment, as well as the nec­es­sary re­form of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO).</p>
    <p>It also com­mit­ted to boost­ing the in­ter­na­tional com­pet­i­tive­ness of mi­cro small and medium en­ter­prises, and fos­ter­ing eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan out­lined four of Sin­ga­pore’s pri­or­i­ties for the G-20 to send a strong sig­nal to the world on its com­mit­ment to sup­port the re­cov­ery of in­ter­na­tional trade and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The first is the need to band to­gether to en­sure the re­silience of sup­ply chains and strengthen their con­nec­tiv­ity dur­ing the pan­demic, said Mr Chan in his speech.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, G-20 mem­bers would need to con­tinue ef­forts to ac­cel­er­ate the i mple­men­ta­tion of the WTO Trade Fa­cil­i­ta­tion Agree­ment to im­prove trade ef­fi­ciency and im­prove the flow of goods across bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Third, mem­bers would need to work to­gether to up­date the WTO sys­tem, espe­cially in the realm of dig­i­tal trade rules.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fourth pri­or­ity is to strengthen in­ter­na­tional in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>“In­creas­ingly, in­vestors are look­ing for greater in­vestor and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion. This will have to be bal­anced with pri­or­i­ties of host gov­ern­ments for sus­tain­able devel­op­ment,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>He said this was an is­sue that the G-20 can play an im­por­tant part in, adding that it was some­thing he hoped would be taken up by the up­com­ing Ital­ian G-20 pres­i­dency next year.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing yes­ter­day’s meet­ing, he also thanked Saudi Ara­bia, which holds this year’s G-20 pres­i­dency. Saudi Ara­bia had in­vited Sin­ga­pore to par­tic­i­pate in the G-20 Trade and In­vest­ment Meet­ings as a guest coun­try.</p>
