    <p>Did you come across this ar­ti­cle on Face­book? Twit­ter? If so, how many of your wak­ing hours today were spent on those plat­forms?</p>
    <p>Screen time for many has spiked in re­cent years, es­pe­cially since the Covid-19 pan­demic, largely ow­ing to co­pi­ous hours spent on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>A new docu­d­rama, The So­cial Dilemma, re­leased on Net­flix in Septem­ber (see other story), high­lights the ad­dic­tive na­ture of th­ese plat­forms, as well as other is­sues per­tain­ing to so­ci­ety’s grow­ing de­pen­dence on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The film caused such a stir, it prompted a re­sponse from Face­book, the largest so­cial me­dia plat­form in the world.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean viewers, many of whom have flocked to so­cial me­dia since the late 2000s, tell The Sun­day Times they can iden­tify with the con­cerns raised in the show.</p>
    <p>Mr Wes­ley Gunter, 40, founder and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Right Hook Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, says he felt “ex­tremely dis­turbed” after watch­ing the movie.</p>
    <p>“My son, 13, is usu­ally on Red­dit and In­sta­gram. Since there is so much anonymity pro­vided by the In­ter­net, I fear he might be ex­posed to un­wanted in­flu­ences on so­cial me­dia,” he says.</p>
    <p>The boy did not watch the film as it did not in­ter­est him.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the last four years, Mr Gunter has tried to grad­u­ally wean him­self off so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>He has made it a point not to check his mo­bile phone dur­ing work meet­ings and con­ver­sa­tions with his fam­ily and friends, es­pe­cially at meal­times.</p>
    <p>At meet­ings, he places his phone face-down, so he is not tempted to look at in­com­ing mes­sages and no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>He also does not take his phone along when cy­cling with friends or dur­ing weekly gym ses­sions.</p>
    <p>De­spite his at­tempts, he es­ti­mates he spends at least two hours a day on Face­book, In­sta­gram and LinkedIn, read­ing news ar­ti­cles and look­ing at pho­tos and videos.</p>
    <p>“I am def­i­nitely try­ing to re­duce this amount,” he says. “Scrolling through some con­tent on so­cial me­dia – such as end­less celebrity gos­sip or on­line vit­ri­olic com­ments – can be un­pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>“If I cut down, I can prob­a­bly read at least four more books a year,” adds the Sin­ga­porean, who reads about two books an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>LIKES AND SELF–WORTH</p>
    <p>Ms De­siree Lai, 38, as­sis­tant pro­gram­ming di­rec­tor and ra­dio per­son­al­ity at SPH Ra­dio sta­tion Kiss92 FM, av­er­ages six to seven hours on so­cial me­dia a day, mainly on Face­book and In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>She watches ev­ery­thing from celebrity news to funny ar­ti­cles to cute cat videos.</p>
    <p>Be­ing seen on so­cial me­dia, as well as mon­i­tor­ing, man­ag­ing and pro­duc­ing con­tent for Kiss92 FM’s plat­forms, are part of her job.</p>
    <p>She scours so­cial me­dia to see what is trend­ing or go­ing vi­ral, so she can jump on it for the sta­tion’s ben­e­fit or her own.</p>
    <p>“Re­duc­ing how long I spend on so­cial me­dia is go­ing to be a tall or­der be­cause of what I do,” she reck­ons.</p>
    <p>“I ba­si­cally eat and breathe so­cial me­dia. Even when I am not on it, I am think­ing about con­tent and plan­ning what to post next on it be­cause I have to.</p>
    <p>“So my goal is to bet­ter man­age my at­ti­tude to­wards so­cial me­dia and the im­pact it has on my men­tal well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, she tries not to com­pare her­self to other in­flu­encers or feel in­ad­e­quate if her pho­tos garner fewer “likes” or com­ments.</p>
    <p>“I am an adult, but even I feel pres­sure to get a cer­tain level of en­gage­ment. It takes ef­fort to not go down the rab­bit hole of think­ing that oth­ers with more ‘likes’ are sim­ply pret­tier, younger or more suc­cess­ful than me,” she re­flects.</p>
    <p>She is con­cerned about younger, less se­cure and more i nvested so­cial in­flu­encers though.</p>
    <p>“What about the younger gen­er­a­tion, who may peg their self-worth to the num­ber of ‘likes’ their self­ies get? There are re­ports that so­cial me­dia af­fects their con­fi­dence and self- es­teem and, to me, such think­ing is in­cred­i­bly up­set­ting and scary.”</p>
    <p>SO­CIAL ME­DIA AD­DIC­TION</p>
    <p>One is­sue raised by the docu­d­rama is that of so­cial me­dia ad­dic­tion, which some psy­chol­o­gists here have ob­served.</p>
    <p>Last year, Mr Haikal Jamil, 36, founder and se­nior clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at Im­Pos­si­ble Psy­cho­log­i­cal Ser­vices, en­coun­tered a young man seek­ing treat­ment for low en­ergy, in­som­nia and re­duced pro</p>
    <p>Scrolling through some con­tent on so­cial me­dia – such as end­less celebrity gos­sip or on­line vit­ri­olic com­ments – can be un­pro­duc­tive. If I cut down, I can prob­a­bly read at least four more books a year.</p>
    <p>duc­tiv­ity at work – clas­sic symp­toms of de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Upon as­sess­ment, it was found that he spent a sig­nif­i­cant amount of time on so­cial me­dia be­fore bed­time and through­out the day, lead­ing to a back­log of un­com­pleted tasks.</p>
    <p>Even after he be­came aware of the harm­ful ef­fects, the man found it dif­fi­cult to cut down on so­cial me­dia use. A one-minute dive into Face­book eas­ily ex­panded into an hour of mind­less scrolling.</p>
    <p>With the help of psy­cho­log­i­cal ther­apy, he even­tu­ally man­aged to ex­tri­cate him­self, lit­tle by lit­tle.</p>
    <p>It is a dif­fi­cult process, says Mr Haikal.</p>
    <p>“Even though ev­ery­one says ex­ces­sive so­cial me­dia use can be harm­ful, we con­tinue to use so­cial me­dia with­out much thought as it fits so eas­ily into our daily rou­tines.”</p>
    <p>He cites a study pub­lished in 2017, which found that al­most 30 per cent of univer­sity stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore, aged 18 to 25, were at risk of “so­cial net­work­ing ad­dic­tion”.</p>
    <p>This means their use of so­cial net­work­ing sites or plat­forms was as­so­ci­ated with symp­toms such as ne­glect­ing their per­sonal or work life, mood al­ter­ation, with­drawal, re­lapse and an in­abil­ity to cut down on us­age, says Mr Haikal.</p>
    <p>The In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health’s Na­tional Ad­dic­tions Man­age­ment Ser­vice (NAMS) pro­vides treat­ment for peo­ple with sub­stance and be­havioural ad­dic­tions, in­clud­ing ex­ces­sive In­ter­net use.</p>
    <p>Dr Melvyn Zhang, a con­sul­tant at NAMS, notes that In­ter­net and so­cial me­dia ad­dic­tion are no dif­fer­ent from other forms of ad­dic­tion, such as drugs or al­co­hol. They can lead to con­se­quences such as in­creased so­cial iso­la­tion, wors­ened fam­ily re­la­tion­ships, poor nu­tri­tion and sleep, tru­ancy or a drop in grades, or psy­cho­log­i­cal ef­fects such as de­pres­sion or anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>When treat­ing ex­ces­sive so­cial me­dia use, NAMS adopts a team­based ap­proach, with psy­chi­a­trists as­sess­ing the is­sue’s sever­ity and the pres­ence of other psy­chi­atric is­sues such as de­pres­sion or anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>Ad­dic­tion coun­sel­lors also use tech­niques such as mo­ti­va­tional in­ter­view­ing, as well as other be­havioural and cog­ni­tive strate­gies, to help pa­tients, he adds.</p>
    <p>The du­ra­tion of treat­ment varies and is very much de­pen­dent on the ex­tent of so­cial me­dia use, as well as the ex­is­tence of men­tal health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ear­lier de­tec­tion and treat­ment will re­sult in bet­ter out­comes for the pa­tient,” he says, urg­ing those at risk to speak to their fam­ily or a pro­fes­sional for help.</p>
