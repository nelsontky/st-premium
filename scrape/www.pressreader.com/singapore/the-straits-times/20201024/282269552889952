    <p>Heart­land busi­nesses are a key part of Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial network and it is im­por­tant for them to trans­form and con­tinue be­ing part of this ecosys­tem, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia af­ter a di­a­logue with The Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions, Sin­ga­pore (FMAS), she said that the Repub­lic would not be the same with­out heart­land en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>“They add vi­brancy and dy­namism to our so­ci­ety, and are ex­tremely ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how ac­ces­si­ble shop­ping cen­tres are, there’s noth­ing that beats the ac­ces­si­bil­ity of neigh­bour­hood hawk­ers and... gro­cery shops,” Madam Hal­imah said, adding that th­ese en­ter­prises also pro­vide the ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­cess to af­ford­able food.</p>
    <p>She ac­knowl­edged that the chal­lenge for them is how to adapt to grow, but the Pres­i­dent was heart­ened to hear that FMAS has been pre­par­ing its mem­bers in this re­gard.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the as­so­ci­a­tion has set a tar­get of hav­ing 70 per cent of the hawk­ers and heart­land re­tail­ers it rep­re­sents dig­i­talise by June next year.</p>
    <p>FMAS rep­re­sents about 16,000 hawk­ers and 17,000 re­tail­ers across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As part of its ef­forts to drive dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion among heart­land busi­nesses, FMAS has or­gan­ised 25 we­bi­nars on top­ics such as e-com­merce and ad­ver­tis­ing over the past six months.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the di­a­logue, mem­bers of the as­so­ci­a­tion high­lighted the chal­lenges that heart­land busi­nesses are fac­ing.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese are more long­stand­ing, such as a man­power crunch, com­pe­ti­tion from e-com­merce and on­line re­tail­ers, while oth­ers have sur­faced more re­cently and are as­so­ci­ated with adopt­ing digital pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo Hiang Meng, pres­i­dent of the FMAS, noted the dif­fi­cul­ties that heart­land busi­nesses face in hir­ing, es­pe­cially with well-ed­u­cated youth un­will­ing to take up jobs in hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of FMAS’ hawker di­vi­sion, Mr An­thony Low, said that the main chal­lenge for hawk­ers in adopt­ing e-pay­ment pro­cesses is the lack of knowl­edge and un­fa­mil­iar­ity with mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“For older hawk­ers, many of them pre­fer to re­ceive cash rather than digital pay­ments, as they feel more as­sured re­ceiv­ing the money in per­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing, Mr Low added: “Some of the older hawk­ers did not even have In­ter­net bank­ing ac­counts, while oth­ers were not aware that there are mo­bile apps you can use to see if pay­ments have gone through.”</p>
    <p>But he said that there has been an uptick in e-pay­ment adop­tion over the past few months, with in­cen­tives such as those pro­vided un­der the Hawk­ers Go Digital pro­gramme prov­ing to be a good en­cour­age­ment to get stall­hold­ers on board cash­less pay­ments.</p>
    <p>There are still some teething prob­lems though, he said.</p>
    <p>Some stall­hold­ers have been scammed by er­rant cus­tomers who show screen­shots of old e-pay­ment trans­ac­tions to trick the hawk­ers into think­ing that pay­ments have been made.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing this, Madam Hal­imah said that gov­ern­ment agen­cies such as the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore will help hawk­ers deal with such is­sues, adding that it is some­thing that can be over­come.</p>
