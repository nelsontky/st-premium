    <p>Coach Ron­ald Koe­man ad­mit­ted that Barcelona would find it dif­fi­cult to wrest back the Span­ish La Liga ti­tle after they ended a trau­matic year by draw­ing 1-1 at home with min­nows Eibar on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The re­sult left Barca with 25 points and sixth in the stand­ings, seven points be­hind joint lead­ers</p>
    <p>Atletico Madrid, who took on Getafe at home, and de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Real Madrid, who faced Elche, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“If we are re­al­is­tic, win­ning the cham­pi­onship is very dif­fi­cult for us,” Koe­man told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing is im­pos­si­ble but we have to ac­knowl­edge the big points dis­tance with Atletico, who are in very good form, look­ing strong, win­ning a lot games and not con­ced­ing many goals.”</p>
    <p>Barca have won eight of the last 12 La Liga ti­tles and if the Dutch­man’s pes­simistic pre­dic­tion is proven right, it would be the first time since the 2007 cam­paign that they missed out on the Span­ish crown in con­sec­u­tive sea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Cata­lans were miss­ing the in­jured Lionel Messi – the cap­tain was in the stands after be­ing al­lowed to re­turn late from an ex­tended break in Ar­gentina – but still had plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Martin Braith­waite fluffed his penalty and Ous­mane Dem­bele came close on sev­eral oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>But yet again, they paid dearly for fail­ing to take their chances, com­pounded by an­other de­fen­sive howler.</p>
    <p>Ron­ald Araujo was the lat­est cul­prit after he lost pos­ses­sion high up the pitch to Kike Gar­cia, who gave Eibar the lead in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>Dem­bele fired home the equaliser but the hosts could not con­jure up a sec­ond, much to Koe­man’s frus­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways good to score first be­cause then the team usu­ally play with more con­fi­dence and ease but in the end, we had more than enough chances to score more,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The draw isn’t fair but this is hap­pen­ing too of­ten to us. We do things badly and once again, an er­ror that led to a goal has cost us. I don’t want to blame any­one but these are key mo­ments in the game.</p>
    <p>“We were lack­ing a player in Leo who makes the dif­fer­ence year after year but I’m left won­der­ing how we didn’t man­age to win the game.</p>
    <p>“We cre­ated chances, missed a penalty and then gave them a goal with their only op­por­tu­nity of the game.”</p>
