    <p>Although many peo­ple like to visit na­ture ar­eas such as parks and na­ture re­serves in their free time, more can be done to help them un­der­stand the im­por­tance of con­serv­ing our green spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s na­ture ar­eas such as Pu­lau Ubin sup­port a rich di­ver­sity of wildlife, and get­ting more peo­ple to be in­ter­ested in na­ture will help to in­crease aware­ness and sup­port for their con­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>It would be nice to see more peo­ple tak­ing an in­ter­est in the in­dige­nous wildlife. Many young peo­ple spend time on the In­ter­net look­ing at pic­tures of cute an­i­mals, yet fail to re­alise that such an­i­mals do ex­ist in the parks and na­ture ar­eas they fre­quent.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Coney Is­land Park is fre­quented by young peo­ple for its pic­turesque views, yet many are un­fa­mil­iar with the more than 80 species of birds that visit the park.</p>
    <p>A “hands-on” ap­pre­ci­a­tion of na­ture could be bet­ter in­te­grated into our ed­u­ca­tional sys­tem. Schools could con­duct more out­ings to our na­ture ar­eas with the spe­cific goal of un­der­stand­ing lo­cal wildlife and ecosys­tems, and per­haps even in­te­grate them into the syl­labus.</p>
    <p>Many stu­dents might find</p>
    <p>study­ing bi­ol­ogy much more palat­able if they could see its ap­pli­ca­tion with their own eyes, and in their own back­yard.</p>
    <p>The wider pub­lic can also take more steps to see and un­der­stand the bio­di­ver­sity around us. Par­tic­u­larly now, when over­seas travel is lim­ited, Sin­ga­pore­ans</p>
    <p>who are bored of stay­ing at home can take the chance to ex­plore na­ture ar­eas here.</p>
    <p>They can even take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties that are al­ready avail­able, such as the up­com­ing Sin­ga­pore Bird Race or­gan­ised by Na­ture So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore). Events like this can only ben­e­fit</p>
    <p>ev­ery­one who takes part, while also pro­mot­ing the con­ser­va­tion of wild birds in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Our is­land home has a lot to of­fer us if we only look for it. I hope that more peo­ple will take an in­ter­est in and get in­volved with our na­ture scene. Ivan Sia Wei Jiun</p>
