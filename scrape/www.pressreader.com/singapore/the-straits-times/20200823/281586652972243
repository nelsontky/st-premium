    <p>TAKEOVER BID</p>
    <p>On Aug 15, Bri­tish news­pa­per Shields Gazette first re­ported that the Bel­la­graph Nova Group (BN Group) had put in a takeover bid for New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club.</p>
    <p>A press state­ment is­sued by the group said it has “sent a LOI (let­ter of in­tent) and a POF (proof of funds) to Mr (Mike) Ash­ley on Aug 10 and our ne­go­ti­a­tions are at the ad­vanced stage”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ash­ley is the owner of New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>The group listed its co-founders as Sin­ga­pore­ans Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh, as well as Ms Evan­ge­line Shen.</p>
    <p>The news was con­firmed by Sky Sports jour­nal­ist Keith Downie who tweeted: “Still big ques­tion marks re­gard­ing Bel­la­graph Nova’s claims they’ve bid £280m (S$503 mil­lion) to buy New­cas­tle United. I’m al­ways scep­ti­cal of any­thing that’s made pub­lic so freely and quickly. But Mike Ash­ley’s lawyers have held talks with BN, and I’ve seen doc­u­men­ta­tion that sup­ports their claims. The docs con­tain £280m of­fer, let­ter of in­tent, and 29-page doc­u­ment with de­tailed fi­nan­cials.”</p>
    <p>DOC­TORED PHOTOS</p>
    <p>On its web­site, the BN Group has posted pictures of the Loh cousins and Ms Shen with former United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama. The photos made it seem like they were taken at a pri­vate meet­ing in Paris.</p>
    <p>The pictures with Mr Obama were in fact taken in Sin­ga­pore at a Dec 14 char­ity event, which Novena Global Life­care – founded by the cousins – spon­sored.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported that BN Group chief mar­ket­ing and in­vestor re­la­tions of­fi­cer Nereides An­to­nio Giamundo de Bour­bon ac­knowl­edged that the group had ma­nip­u­lated the im­ages in ma­te­ri­als used to pub­li­cise the group.</p>
    <p>He was re­ported as say­ing: “We are se­ri­ous peo­ple... the only am­bigu­ous thing has been the pho­to­shopped pic­ture.</p>
    <p>“There wasn’t any ma­li­cious aim be­hind it.”</p>
    <p>ALAN SHEARER’S BACK­ING</p>
    <p>In a me­dia state­ment last week, the BN Group said it had en­listed the help of former Eng­land cap­tain Alan Shearer and former player Michael Cho­pra to sup­port its takeover bid.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish pa­per The Tele­graph re­ported that “sources close to the New­cas­tle and Premier League le­gend (Shearer)... de­nied any in­volve­ment with BNG”.</p>
    <p>Former Mag­pies striker Cho­pra, how­ever, did visit the group’s Paris head­quar­ters, based on a pic­ture he tweeted.</p>
    <p>PARIS HEAD­QUAR­TERS</p>
    <p>The BN Group states on its web­site that its new head­quar­ters is at the “renowned No. 10 Place Ven­dome in Paris, France”. This is where the Ritz Ho­tel and high­end bou­tiques are lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported yes­ter­day that there is no com­pany called Bel­la­graph Nova Group reg­is­tered in France.</p>
    <p>Its re­porter also could not find any com­pany of the same name at the ad­dress. It added that “a re­cep­tion­ist at an of­fice rental busi­ness op­er­ated by Re­gus in the build­ing said BN Group has used its space, but its staff were not al­ways present”.</p>
    <p>OVER 10,000 JETS</p>
    <p>A post on the @bel­la­graph­no­va­group In­sta­gram ac­count said “with our world record num­ber of pri­vate jets for a sin­gle en­tity, our over 10,000 pri­vate jets are ready to take you any­where you wish to go with an un­prece­dented ex­pe­ri­ence on board”.</p>
    <p>No in­for­ma­tion or book­ing func­tion is avail­able on the web­site of Dorr Group Pri­vate Jet Char­ter­ing, one of BN Group’s en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The In­sta­gram post was later edited to re­move the men­tion of the num­ber of pri­vate jets at its dis­posal.</p>
    <p>Asked how in­ter­ested par­ties could book a flight from them, a BN Group rep­re­sen­ta­tive re­sponded to The Sunday Times last night and said: “To book a pri­vate jet, clients will reach out to us through our part­ners or our sales agents. If you wish to book one, we’ll have one of our agents speak to you.”</p>
    <p>CRIS­TIANO RON­ALDO</p>
    <p>Mr de Bour­bon re­port­edly told The Tele­graph that the group planned to sign Cris­tiano Ron­aldo and said it was in “di­rect con­tact” with the Ju­ven­tus su­per­star.</p>
    <p>A source close to the player told The Sunday Times that he had not heard of such con­tact.</p>
    <p>HY­DRA X</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy firm Hy­dra X is listed as one of BN Group’s more than 30 en­ti­ties, and it is sup­posed to be im­ple­ment­ing a trad­ing sys­tem for the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change, ac­cord­ing to a mar­ket­ing brief the group sent to the me­dia ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported that Hy­dra X and the ex­change de­nied this.</p>
