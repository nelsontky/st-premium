    <p>A cap on the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed at any one time in­side four pop­u­lar mar­kets here is still nec­es­sary to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are ef­fec­tive, said the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The four mar­kets – Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket, Chong Pang Mar­ket at Block 104/105 Yishun Ring Road, and the mar­kets at Block 20/21 Mar­sil­ing Lane and Block 505 Jurong</p>
    <p>West Street 52 – had pre­vi­ously im­posed en­try re­stric­tions allowing peo­ple to visit only on odd or even dates, de­pend­ing on the last digit of their iden­tity card num­ber.</p>
    <p>These re­stric­tions were fully lifted last Satur­day as part of a grad­ual re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties in phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing of the econ­omy after the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>This was to help im­prove foot­fall for af­fected mar­ket stall­hold­ers, and give cus­tomers more flex­i­bil­ity to visit the mar­kets, said NEA.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ca­pac­ity caps are still needed, said the agency yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“While it is eas­ier for pa­trons to ob­serve a safe dis­tance of 1m be­tween one an­other when queue­ing to en­ter these mar­kets, it is harder for them to do so in­side the mar­kets due to the dy­namic crowd sit­u­a­tion and lay­out of the mar­ket,” it said.</p>
    <p>“While some parts of the mar­ket may look spa­cious, other ar­eas such as the frontage of stalls, es­pe­cially those sell­ing seafood and veg­eta­bles, and ar­eas where the aisles are nar­rower, or nat­u­ral choke points of the mar­ket, may re­main crowded through­out most of the morn­ing mar­ket­ing hour.”</p>
    <p>NEA’s state­ment comes after The Straits Times re­ported last Satur­day that stall own­ers at Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket said the lift­ing of en­try re­stric­tions had not made a dif­fer­ence to foot­fall as ca­pac­ity caps are still in place.</p>
    <p>NEA noted that when en­try re­stric­tions on week­days were lifted on Aug 13, av­er­age daily foot­fall across the four mar­kets in­creased by be­tween 18 per cent and 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>When the re­stric­tions for week­ends were lifted last Satur­day, av­er­age daily foot­fall at the four mar­kets over the weekend in­creased by be­tween 25 per cent and 40 per cent com­pared with the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>The queues out­side the mar­kets were also longer, with the long­est one of 160 peo­ple ob­served at Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket dur­ing the morn­ing peak hour, when pa­trons waited for about 30 min­utes to en­ter.</p>
    <p>Queues at the mar­ket at Block 20/21 Mar­sil­ing Lane were mod­er­ate, while short queues were ob­served at the one at Block 505 Jurong West Street 52 and at Chong Pang Mar­ket, said NEA.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, the weekend queue sit­u­a­tion out­side the mar­kets re­mains man­age­able over the last weekend, al­though close monitoring would be needed as we ex­pect the queues to in­crease fur­ther over the next few week­ends,” it said.</p>
