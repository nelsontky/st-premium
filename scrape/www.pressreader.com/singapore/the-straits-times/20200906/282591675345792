    <p>Com­bin­ing com­edy with po­lit­i­cal anal­y­sis, the Net­flix show hosted by Amer­i­can co­me­dian Hasan Minhaj (above) has won awards, in­clud­ing an Emmy and a Pe­abody.</p>
    <p>A week af­ter Net­flix an­nounced last month that it was can­celling the show, with­out giv­ing any ex­pla­na­tion, a for­mer em­ployee, Pak­istani pro­ducer Nur Nas­reen, tweeted that she was “hu­mil­i­ated and gaslit, tar­geted and ig­nored” on set.</p>
    <p>The show, she added, should have “prac­tised the pro­gres­sive ethos they cul­ti­vated on screen”.</p>
    <p>Another for­mer em­ployee, jour­nal­ist Sheila V. Ku­mar, had ear­lier tweeted that she had “never been more un­happy” than when she was work­ing on the show.</p>
    <p>Amy Zhang, a for­mer writer and pro­ducer, also tweeted that women of colour were “si­lenced, treated un­fairly and made to later doubt their own skills in a toxic news­room”.</p>
