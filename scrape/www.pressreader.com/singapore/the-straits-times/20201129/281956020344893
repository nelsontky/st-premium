    <p>Peo­ple liv­ing in one- to three-room Hous­ing Board flats can now get help buy­ing ap­pli­ances that are more en­ergy- or water-ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble ap­pli­cants for a pro­gramme launched yes­ter­day will re­ceive three e-vouch­ers to­talling $225. One $150 e-voucher can be used for an en­ergy-ef­fi­cient, cli­mate-friendly re­frig­er­a­tor, a $50 one can off­set the cost of chang­ing shower fit­tings to more water-ef­fi­cient three-tick mod­els and a $25 e-voucher can go to LED lights.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the Cli­mate-Friendly House­holds Pro­gramme, as it is called, were an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat at the launch of the an­nual Clean and Green Sin­ga­pore move­ment at ITE Col­lege East yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter, said: “El­i­gi­ble house­holds will be able to ap­ply on­line for their e-vouch­ers. I hope this $25 mil­lion pack­age will en­cour­age house­holds to take ac­tion to re­duce their en­ergy and water con­sump­tion. By do­ing so, they will also be saving money.”</p>
    <p>House­holds that switch from a one-tick to a three-tick re­frig­er­a­tor model, for in­stance, could reap an­nual sav­ings of about $50 over the 10-year life­span of the ap­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency es­ti­mates that if all the 300,000 or so el­i­gi­ble house­holds make the switch, the col­lec­tive re­duc­tion in car­bon emis­sions will be equiv­a­lent to tak­ing 31,000 cars off the road while the water sav­ings would amount to 400 mil­lion gal­lons of water an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers will ex­pire on Dec 31, 2023. More in­for­ma­tion can be found at www.go.gov.sg/cfhp.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also noted that en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity had been a fo­cus for Sin­ga­pore since its early years but the pan­demic has high­lighted its im­por­tance. “Keep­ing Sin­ga­pore clean has taken on greater sig­nif­i­cance as per­sonal hy­giene and public clean­li­ness are key lines of de­fence against the Covid-19 pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also “re­dou­bling” its ef­forts to build a greener, more sus­tain­able fu­ture, Mr Heng added, cit­ing plans to green build­ings, ex­tract value from waste and trans­form Sin­ga­pore into a City in Na­ture – where there is more green in­fused into the grey cityscape.</p>
    <p>“Our ef­forts to cre­ate a greener and more sus­tain­able fu­ture will not only im­prove our liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment, they will help to grow our econ­omy, gen­er­ate more busi­ness and cre­ate good green jobs,” Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the shift to­wards more re­cy­cling, reusing, re­pair­ing and re-man­u­fac­tur­ing of prod­ucts will cre­ate new eco­nomic pos­si­bil­i­ties, he added.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal san­i­ta­tion and waste man­age­ment stan­dards, as well as up­skilling work­ers, will al­low peo­ple to ac­cess higher value-added jobs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has done well in its en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity jour­ney, noted Mr Heng, but there are still press­ing chal­lenges ahead, such as cli­mate change and public health threats. “By work­ing in close part­ner­ship, we can achieve even more. This is the spirit of Sin­ga­pore To­gether. Let us work to­wards build­ing a cleaner, greener and more sus­tain­able fu­ture for our­selves and our chil­dren in the years to come,” he said.</p>
