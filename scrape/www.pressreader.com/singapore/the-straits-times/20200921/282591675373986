    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your ag­gres­sive ten­den­cies are mak­ing life weird. Find a way to ratchet it back and you will be closer to achiev­ing your goals.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your ten­dency to­wards pos­ses­sive­ness is com­ing out and you may have to deal with a new wrin­kle in a re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You see things that are barely mak­ing sense. Gather enough data and your un­der­stand­ing should click into place.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your heart feels as if it has been through a wringer. There is an up­side, though – you should be able to make a fresh start soon.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You have to deal with junk. It is a great time to let go of it, though you may be tempted to trade it in for some amaz­ing finds.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Look into that one is­sue that has been bug­ging you – you can see what is go­ing on with greater clar­ity.</p>

    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>

    <p>Sagit­tar­ius</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>

    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
