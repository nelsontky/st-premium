    <p>Mu­jir Hayyan Mo­ham­mad Tau­fiq may be anx­ious about sit­ting the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion this year, but his par­ents are even more stressed – it is their first ex­pe­ri­ence with the PSLE as both were ed­u­cated in madrasahs (reli­gious schools).</p>
    <p>“As much as we re­as­sure our­selves that it is just like any other year-end exam Hayyan will be sit­ting, the pres­sure and stresses do ex­ist,” says his mother, Ms Hu­rul-A’in Mohd Yu­soff, 36, prin­ci­pal of a child­care cen­tre.</p>
    <p>His father Mo­ham­mad Tau­fiq Mo­hamed Is­mail, 40, man­ages a mosque. They also have a six-yearold daugh­ter study­ing in a madrasah.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, we al­ways re­mind our­selves that this is not our ex­am­i­na­tion, it is Hayyan’s,” says Ms Hu­rulA’in, stress­ing that her 111/ 2- yearold son’s men­tal health is more im­por­tant than his grades.</p>
    <p>Her fo­cus is not mis­placed in a year that has seen ed­u­ca­tional sys­tems across the world shat­tered by the pan­demic, leav­ing fam­i­lies dis­ori­ented and dispir­ited.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with many coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore’s main­stream schools have been rel­a­tively un­scathed. Na­tional ex­am­i­na­tions are pro­ceed­ing, al­beit with so­cial dis­tanc­ing pro­to­cols and ex­am­inable top­ics trimmed to com­pen­sate for home-based learn­ing (HBL) dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker in April and May.</p>
    <p>About 41,000 can­di­dates have reg­is­tered to take the PSLE this year, says a Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board spokesman.</p>
    <p>Some mums and dads are striv­ing to sup­port their 12-year-olds with ges­tures of en­cour­age­ment and in­spi­ra­tion dur­ing this un­usual school year. Ex­perts also urge par­ents to en­sure that their kids get enough rest and to re­mind them that they are more than their T-score.</p>
    <p>A look at the calls to Tin­kle Friend, a be­friend­ing ser­vice for pri­mary school chil­dren run by the Sin­ga­pore Chil­dren’s So­ci­ety char­ity, re­veals the tra­jec­tory of PSLE con­cerns dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of PSLE-re­lated calls and chats rose from 28 in April at the start of the cir­cuit breaker to an av­er­age of 77 a month in June and July, be­fore fall­ing to 57 last month, says Ms Leela Narayana, as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of Stu­dent Ser­vice at the Chil­dren’s So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In the ear­lier months, she says PSLE kids were wor­ried that they would not be ad­e­quately pre­pared be­cause of the many dis­rup­tions. Some felt less mo­ti­vated to study dur­ing HBL and oth­ers were frus­trated at be­ing deprived of play­time.</p>
    <p>“Most chil­dren were also fear­ful that they would not be able to meet their par­ents’, teach­ers’ and per­sonal ex­pec­ta­tions,” she adds.</p>
    <p>How­ever, most stu­dents seem to have adapted to the new pan­demic norms and the re­turn to class­room learn­ing, she says.</p>
    <p>As such, the na­ture of more re­cent calls mir­rored con­cerns from pre­vi­ous years, in­clud­ing study dis­trac­tions, anx­i­ety over poor grades, self-es­teem and phys­i­cal health is­sues, as well as tips on time and stress man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The many ed­u­ca­tional dis­rup­tions this year have also left some par­ents and chil­dren wor­ried about the chances of get­ting into their schools of choice, says Ms Tan SuLynn, a se­nior ed­u­ca­tional psy­chol­o­gist with Prom­ises Health­care.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded the scrap­ping of mid-year ex­am­i­na­tions and changes to how schools pick stu­dents for the Di­rect School Ad­mis­sion, a scheme where tal­ented chil­dren re­ceive early ad­mis­sion into cer­tain sec­ondary schools and ju­nior col­leges.</p>
    <p>She adds that par­ents are also un­cer­tain about the safety of their chil­dren dur­ing the ex­am­i­na­tions, and some are fear­ful about their kids fall­ing ill be­fore their pa­pers.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­i­na­tion anx­i­ety may also make it dif­fi­cult for some chil­dren to breathe while wear­ing masks or face shields, which adds to their stress lev­els.</p>
    <p>SEE­ING THE POS­I­TIVES</p>
    <p>While tran­si­tion­ing to HBL was nerve-rack­ing for many fam­i­lies, some par­ents say they are grate­ful for its pos­i­tive as­pects.</p>
    <p>“We kind of en­joy the part where we can both sleep a bit later and me not hav­ing to rush her to eat and change for school,” says stay-ath­ome mum Chew Swee Sien, 46, whose daugh­ter Seah Ern Ting, 12, is sit­ting the na­tional ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>As this is her sec­ond time as a PSLE par­ent – she has a son in Sec­ondary 3 – she is “very re­laxed” about the process and makes sure that both her chil­dren en­joy out­ings and have time for play and hob­bies.</p>
    <p>When Ern Ting was ner­vous be­fore her Chi­nese oral ex­am­i­na­tion in the mid­dle of last month, Ms Chew en­cour­aged her by telling her to “just do what­ever you can” if she was given an un­fa­mil­iar topic and ac­knowl­edg­ing the girl’s prepa­ra­tion ef­forts, seal­ing it with a big kiss.</p>
    <p>Such acts of ap­pre­ci­a­tion go a long way in in­spir­ing re­vi­sion-weary kids.</p>
    <p>Xavier Chua, 12, was chuffed to re­ceive a PSLE sur­vival kit from his mother just be­fore his oral ex­am­i­na­tion last month.</p>
    <p>Inside the brightly dec­o­rated box, he found his favourite snacks and a note of en­cour­age­ment for his hard work over the last eight months. “I felt very touched be­cause mummy took time and ef­fort to make the kit for me. I thanked her and gave her a big squeeze,” Xavier says.</p>
    <p>His mother, stay-at-home mum and blog­ger Serene Seah, 38, says she learnt of the idea from a friend.</p>
    <p>“It is not all about the fi­nal re­sult. The need to recog­nise the ef­forts along the jour­ney is equally im­por­tant to fuel him emo­tion­ally to keep him go­ing and put in his best per­for­mance,” she ex­plains.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Hayyan’s par­ents have en­gaged him in mean­ing­ful ways, in­clud­ing na­ture walks to Bukit Timah Na­ture Re­serve and Up­per Peirce Reser­voir Park as he likes trekking.</p>
    <p>Ms Hu­rul-A’in made his favourite dishes, such as so­tong masak hi­tam (black-ink squid), even though the child­care cen­tre she heads was still op­er­at­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, while Mr Mo­ham­mad Tau­fiq gave him a jer­sey from his favourite foot­ball team, Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>“I was ec­static,” Hayyan says of the gift he re­ceived last week.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he is mind­ful of the faith his par­ents have in his abil­i­ties. “I know that I need to do much bet­ter (than now) for my PSLE and I be­lieve I can.”</p>
    <p>A lucky few chil­dren seem to have struck the per­fect bal­ance dur­ing the pan­demic, en­joy­ing their last year of child­hood while keep­ing up with the de­mands of the PSLE timetable.</p>
    <p>Damien Soon, who turns 12 in De­cem­ber, trea­sures his two hours of play a day, which he spends swim­ming, play­ing foot­ball or tak­ing walks with his friends or fam­ily. The pro­lific young artist also had time to dab­ble in his pas­sion daily dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, although this has been re­duced to two to three times a week since school re­sumed in June.</p>
    <p>Even with tu­ition in two sub­jects, he de­clares: “I’m not very stressed.”</p>
    <p>His stay-at-home mother Denise Gay, 46, thinks par­ents rather than schools de­ter­mine the level of PSLE pres­sure their chil­dren ex­pe­ri­ence. She has a younger son in Pri­mary 3.</p>
    <p>“Of course, we want him to go to his first choice of school, but it’s about his at­ti­tude. (I tell him) if you want to go to School A, you know the cut-off point and you just have to work to­wards it,” she says.</p>
    <p>She adds that she does not be­lieve in nag­ging him in­ces­santly to study or do­ing any­thing spe­cial, as she feels that there is too much em­pha­sis on the na­tional ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“Once the pa­per is fin­ished, we don’t talk about it any­more. We move on.”</p>
    <p>Other par­ents like Ms Seah are con­sciously wind­ing down their chil­dren’s stress lev­els in the last lap be­fore the writ­ten pa­pers from Oct 1 to 7.</p>
    <p>Cog­nisant of her son Xavier’s men­tal health, she plans to give him a “cool­ing-off pe­riod” the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>In­stead of as­sign­ing more as­sess­ment work, she will take him through in­cor­rect ques­tions done pre­vi­ously and al­low him to con­tinue at­tend­ing his swim train­ing ses­sions. She has also taught him men­tal re­lax­ation tech­niques to de­stress.</p>
    <p>Xavier is grate­ful that some top­ics from math­e­mat­ics and sci­ence have been re­moved from the PSLE pa­pers as it re­lieves some of the aca­demic pres­sure he felt ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“There are fewer top­ics to re­vise and it gives me more time to fo­cus on oth­ers. The chances of such a sit­u­a­tion hap­pen­ing would prob­a­bly be one in a mil­lion,” he says.</p>
    <p>“But I wish Covid-19 would end soon so that I can spend time trav­el­ling with my fam­ily again.”</p>
