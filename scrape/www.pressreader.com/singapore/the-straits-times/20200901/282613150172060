    <p>Heart­break drove Weng Pixin into comics.</p>
    <p>Un­able to talk to fam­ily or friends about a break-up in her mid-20s, the Sin­ga­porean artist poured her lone­li­ness into draw­ing.</p>
    <p>“I thought I could paint it out,” she says. “But I re­alised that draw­ing wasn’t enough. And then I started to write words around it and it turned out I have a lot of things to say, and the medium of comics re­ally gave me an av­enue to say them.”</p>
    <p>Weng, 37, has had her de­but book Sweet Time pub­lished by Drawn & Quar­terly, the Canada-based com­pany renowned for pub­lish­ing car­toon­ists such as Chris Ware, Kate Beaton and Ch­ester Brown.</p>
    <p>In 2018, it pub­lished Nick Dr­naso’s Sab­rina, the first graphic novel to be longlisted for the Man Booker Prize.</p>
    <p>“It was sur­real,” says Weng. “It was like be­ing in­vited to a party by a group of mu­si­cians you lis­tened to when you were grow­ing up.”</p>
    <p>Sweet Time, which charts Weng’s work from when she was 25 to her early 30s, is a col­lec­tion of colour­ful sto­ries and scenes, some whim­si­cal, many melan­choly.</p>
    <p>A cou­ple wan­der down the street to­wards a fan­tas­ti­cal house full of birds. Ar­gentina Diaries is a se­ries of travel snapshots: a dead dog ly­ing by the high­way, a jug­gler per­form­ing for driv­ers at a stop light, a jacaranda tree in bloom.</p>
    <p>“I’m lost,” reads the cap­tion of a paint­ing of a traf­fic junc­tion. “‘Get down at this stop,’ my gut says. And, I found, I was ex­actly where I ought to be.”</p>
    <p>Weng has been cre­at­ing comics since 2006. She stud­ied paint­ing at what was then Lasalle-SIA Col­lege of the Arts, but upon grad­u­a­tion, baulked at seek­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tion at gal­leries.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never felt com­fort­able with that whole en­vi­ron­ment,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways felt like mak­ing art and shar­ing it with as many peo­ple as I can makes a lot more sense than to sell it ex­clu­sively at ridicu­lous prices.”</p>
    <p>In­stead, she worked as a wait­ress and made art in her down time. She liked how me­thod­i­cal wait­ress­ing was, she says, and how it kept her body in mo­tion. At the cafe she worked at, the own­ers let her put her paint­ings up on the walls.</p>
    <p>Seven years in and frus­trated that she could not find an av­enue to pub­lish her work, she was con­sid­er­ing giv­ing up on comics.</p>
    <p>Then she went to Buenos Aires for a res­i­dency. There, she met an artist whom she had been friends with on­line for years and who in­vited her to join Chicks On Comics, a col­lec­tive for fe­male car­toon­ists.</p>
    <p>“I saw how hav­ing your own tribe helps you, as an artist, feel less alone in your craft,” she says.</p>
    <p>Weng, who also sews and holds art work­shops for chil­dren, has an­other graphic novel un­der con­sid­er­a­tion for pub­li­ca­tion, based on her ma­tri­lin­eal line. It de­picts scenes from the women in this line, from her great-grand­mother to her imag­i­nary fu­ture daugh­ter, each aged 15.</p>
    <p>“I feel my work can come across as (fem­i­nine), that peo­ple will look at it and go, ‘Whoa, that’s so emo­tional.’ I think that some­times ‘That’s so emo­tional’ is al­most like a bracket, ‘that’s so fe­male’.</p>
    <p>“But I don’t re­ally care. It doesn’t mat­ter to me whether you see it as fe­male or not. As an artist, I just want to fo­cus on mak­ing my work, with­out hav­ing it clouded by any ex­ter­nal noise.” • Sweet Time ($41.45) is avail­able at bit.ly/Sweet­Time_Weng</p>
