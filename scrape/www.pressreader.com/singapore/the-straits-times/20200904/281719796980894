    <p>Amid the sharp­en­ing pub­lic dis­course on so­cial in­equal­ity, partly due to hard­ships caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) brought up the idea of a min­i­mum wage yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He set it in the con­text of the need for more com­pas­sion­ate pol­i­cy­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>He also said that some­thing “stu­dents of pol­icy” learn very early on is that pol­icy in­volves a trade-off be­tween ef­fi­ciency and eq­uity, and pol­i­cy­mak­ers here have for too long leaned too far to­wards ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>“The root of these chal­lenges is in­suf­fi­cient com­pas­sion in our pol­i­cy­mak­ing process,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When we pri­ori­tise com­pas­sion, we be­come more willing to err on the side of eq­uity, per­haps at some ex­pense to ef­fi­ciency.”</p>
    <p>The speech went on to broadly high­light the plight of Sin­ga­pore­ans, and the need to trans­late em­pa­thy into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“All we need is the courage of our con­vic­tions,” he said in earnest.</p>
    <p>This was fol­lowed by a flurry of clar­i­fi­ca­tions and questions from the rul­ing party, and in­creas­ingly eva­sive re­sponses from Prof Lim.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad coun­tered that the is­sue is not new – the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model (PWM) goes back al­most 10 years, and has been thought through and de­bated in the House.</p>
    <p>Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC) cut to the chase and asked for two pieces of in­for­ma­tion: the ap­pro­pri­ate level of min­i­mum wage, and ex­am­ples of coun­tries with min­i­mum wage that have a lower un­em­ploy­ment rate than Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin Pei Ling (MacPher­son) asked if – by ac­knowl­edg­ing that min­i­mum wage might not be suit­able in a poor eco­nomic cli­mate – he in­tended to im­ple­ment it af­ter the cri­sis, with­draw it dur­ing the next cri­sis and so on, and whether such cy­cling in its im­ple­men­ta­tion would be ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>She also asked for specifics on the min­i­mum wage he would set for his town coun­cil clean­ers.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim re­sponded that one has to be care­ful about im­ple­ment­ing this in a sin­gle town coun­cil, as there would be “gen­eral equi­lib­rium ef­fects”.</p>
    <p>The sub­sti­tu­tion of labour would take place, he said, and low-wage jobs would mi­grate out of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>At this point, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State Janil Puthuc­heary in­ter­vened on a point of or­der.</p>
    <p>He said, drily: “Mr Speaker, Mr Ja­mus Lim was asked a ques­tion. While I ap­pre­ci­ate his eru­di­tion in eco­nom­ics, and I’m learn­ing quite a lot from him, he hasn’t an­swered Ms Tin’s ques­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tin had asked if he had a pro­posal for youth em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim then replied that con­text is im­por­tant. “We do not want to roll out spe­cific pro­pos­als to ad­dress youth un­em­ploy­ment at a time when we are in a re­ces­sion, be­cause we are not sure if the un­em­ploy­ment is jus­ti­fied or not.</p>
    <p>“I do not have a spe­cific pol­icy in mind be­cause I have not thought about it.”</p>
    <p>By the time Mr Si­toh Yih Pin (Po­tong Pasir) waded into the de­bate, the ten­sion – and one might even say frus­tra­tion – in the air was pal­pa­ble.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing record low global in­ter­est rates, Prof Lim had ar­gued, us­ing the anal­ogy of re­mort­gag­ing a house, that gov­ern­ments should in­vest in things that would give them higher re­turns.</p>
    <p>Mr Si­toh, an ac­coun­tant, said he was “per­turbed” by this ar­gu­ment. “If I heard you cor­rectly, you said given the low in­ter­est rate, it is now time to re­mort­gage your prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>“As an ac­coun­tant with over three decades of ex­pe­ri­ence, I can tell you that is how peo­ple start get­ting into trou­ble.”</p>
    <p>It took Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam’s in­ter­ven­tion to bring the nearly hour-long ex­change to a close.</p>
    <p>He had three points to make. First, the Govern­ment gen­uinely be­lieves that it is im­por­tant to raise the wages of the low­est-paid work­ers. It also be­lieves it can go fur­ther. The PWM is a min­i­mum wage-plus model and takes a sec­toral ap­proach, which “al­lows you to set the min­i­mum rung at a level that is not so low and not so high”.</p>
    <p>He ceded that how to do this with­out peo­ple gam­ing the sys­tem is an is­sue that pol­i­cy­mak­ers grap­ple with.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, no one has a mo­nop­oly over com­pas­sion.</p>
    <p>“I’ve lis­tened to speeches over the last few days amongst ev­ery­one. I must say some of my PAP col­leagues re­ally made an im­pres­sion on me, not just for the very force­ful pro­pos­als they were mak­ing, of­ten go­ing be­yond what the Govern­ment is do­ing, but the emo­tional force of their con­vic­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So please don’t as­sume. None of us should as­sume that we have a mo­nop­oly over com­pas­sion.”</p>
    <p>Third, one should avoid straw man ar­gu­ments such as say­ing that the Govern­ment is in­ter­ested only in ef­fi­ciency and not eq­uity – some­thing which is “frankly laugh­able”, he said.</p>
    <p>“Try to avoid that man­ner of ar­gu­ment or paint­ing ev­ery­thing in bi­nary terms.</p>
    <p>“Rais­ing the stan­dard of liv­ing of the poor is a com­pli­cated mat­ter, and I say this by the way as an econ­o­mist.</p>
    <p>“How do we do it with­out los­ing the wage earner’s abil­ity to have the pride of hav­ing a job and earn­ing a wage? We do it through the PWM, which has to be ex­panded.</p>
    <p>“We do it through Work­fare. We do it through a range of other sub­si­dies.”</p>
    <p>The Se­nior Min­is­ter’s re­marks were short and dig­ni­fied.</p>
    <p>One does not ex­pect per­fec­tion from mem­bers of the House.</p>
    <p>There will in­vari­ably be speeches that are long on rhetoric and short on specifics.</p>
    <p>But by any mea­sure, what was sur­pris­ing about Prof Lim’s speech yes­ter­day was his de­ci­sion to men­tion a min­i­mum wage with­out a few num­bers at his fin­ger­tips, given that it was a key plank of the opposition’s cam­paign plat­form dur­ing the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Party, for in­stance, pro­posed a na­tional min­i­mum take-home wage of $1,300 a month for full-time work, the amount an av­er­age four-per­son house­hold in Sin­ga­pore needs to spend on ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties such as food, cloth­ing and shel­ter each month.</p>
    <p>The party also pro­posed a re­dun­dancy in­sur­ance scheme for work­ers, un­der which they pay $4 a month, matched by em­ploy­ers, into an Em­ploy­ment Se­cu­rity Fund which pays out 40 per cent of their last-drawn salary for up to six months if they are re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Go­ing fur­ther back, mem­bers of the House who had pro­posed other forms of in­come sup­port – such as for­mer Nom­i­nated MP Wal­ter Th­e­seira, who co-wrote a pol­icy pa­per on a tem­po­rary univer­sal ba­sic in­come scheme – came to the House armed with in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>If there was one take­away from the wage de­bate yes­ter­day, it is this: that MPs, and per­haps it ap­plies more to newer ones, must come pre­pared with de­tails and be ready to de­fend their po­si­tions ro­bustly when chal­lenged, lest the is­sues un­der scru­tiny gen­er­ate more heat than light.</p>
