    <p>Lion City Sailors have been pour­ing re­sources into youth devel­op­ment in re­cent months, first an­nounc­ing a pledge of $1 mil­lion over four years for the club’s foot­ball academy and then re­veal­ing a $10 mil­lion blue­print for its home.</p>
    <p>The am­bi­tions of the first pri­va­tised Sin­ga­pore Premier League club were given a boost when their academy was awarded a one-star rat­ing by the Asian Foot­ball Con­fed­er­a­tion (AFC), the first in the coun­try to achieve the feat. The re­gional gov­ern­ing body has a max­i­mum rat­ing of three stars.</p>
    <p>The academy’s gen­eral man­ager Tan Li Yu called the AFC’s en­dorse­ment “an hon­our” and said it was a “val­i­da­tion of the sys­tems and pro­cesses” at the academy, which grooms play­ers from the age of six to 18.</p>
    <p>He said: “We are proud to be recog­nised as a one-star academy, but we are aim­ing higher. This is only the first step for the LCS foot­ball academy on our path to­wards be­com­ing an elite devel­op­ment hub.”</p>
    <p>Academy direc­tor Luka Lalic also re­vealed it is work­ing to­wards qual­i­fy­ing for a higher rat­ing as more spe­cial­ist staff are brought in go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>The grad­ing is part of the AFC’s elite youth scheme, an ini­tia­tive aimed at im­prov­ing devel­op­ment pro­grammes of its mem­ber na­tions. Acad­e­mies are eval­u­ated on 20 per­for­mance cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion, fa­cil­i­ties and pro­grammes, wel­fare, and psy­chol­ogy and ed­u­ca­tion. They are then sorted into three tiers: one-, twoand three-star.</p>
    <p>Be­ing a one-star academy means that the Sailors’ out­fit has the fun­da­men­tals re­quired for an elite youth academy.</p>
    <p>The academy’s elite pro­gramme will kick off with its pi­o­neer batch of 25 play­ers af­ter the com­ple­tion of the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tions on Oct 7. It aims to help play­ers bal­ance their stud­ies while al­low­ing them to pur­sue a pro­fes­sional foot­ball ca­reer, and will cover train­ing, in­surance and ap­parel costs for all play­ers.</p>
    <p>The play­ers will be sup­ported by staff such as nu­tri­tion­ists, sports psy­chol­o­gists and sports doc­tors.</p>
    <p>The academy is also ex­pected to have its own train­ing fa­cil­ity com­pris­ing six ar­ti­fi­cial turfs, a club­house with ded­i­cated locker rooms and show­ers, func­tional and re­cov­ery gyms, and a can­teen by 2022.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a state­ment by the Sailors, the one-star grad­ing played a cru­cial role in help­ing the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) pass the AFC’s 11-point eval­u­a­tion cri­te­ria to be­come a full mem­ber of the elite youth scheme.</p>
    <p>FAS tech­ni­cal direc­tor Joseph Palat­sides hopes that the rat­ing will pave the way for oth­ers in the foot­ball ecosys­tem to fol­low suit, stat­ing that it is the long-term goal for ev­ery academy in Sin­ga­pore to be ac­cred­ited and “have a solid de­vel­op­men­tal struc­ture”.</p>
    <p>He said: “We want other club acad­e­mies to be ac­cred­ited as well, and our role at the FAS is to con­tinue play­ing the role of an en­abler to make sure these acad­e­mies are in the best pos­si­ble state to be con­sid­ered for such ac­cred­i­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>Palat­sides added that the FAS will be reach­ing out to pro­vide as­sis­tance to all youth de­vel­op­men­tal cen­tres in­ter­ested in also at­tain­ing ac­cred­i­ta­tion from the AFC.</p>
