    <p>By the time Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (FA) chair­man Greg Clarke apol­o­gised for re­fer­ring to black play­ers as “coloured”, it was too late.</p>
    <p>He had al­ready scored a ver­bal own goal by telling the Bri­tish par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tee on sports on Tues­day how South Asians fill­ing up the in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy depart­ment of the English FA qual­i­fied as a di­ver­sity prob­lem.</p>
    <p>But even that was only one part of a dis­as­trous day of fum­bling tes­ti­mony in which he also called be­ing gay a “life choice” and ex­plained away a lack of fe­male goal­keep­ers in a sex­ist man­ner by say­ing he had been told girls “don’t like the ball kicked at them hard”.</p>
    <p>MP Kevin Bren­nan, a mem­ber of the com­mit­tee on sports, sub­se­quently asked Clarke if he would like to with­draw the use of the term “coloured peo­ple”, which he had used when dis­cussing rep­re­sen­ta­tion in foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“If I said it, I deeply apol­o­gise for it,” Clarke, 63, said, be­fore bizarrely ex­plain­ing that he had done so be­cause he had worked for many years in the United States where “I was re­quired to use the term, ‘Peo­ple of colour’.”</p>
    <p>“Some­times, I trip over my words, and I apol­o­gise,” he added.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the hear­ing had ended, a cho­rus of shock, anger and frus­tra­tion on so­cial me­dia over Clarke’s tes­ti­mony had grown to in­clude anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion cam­paign­ers like Kick It Out and Women in Foot­ball and prom­i­nent pun­dits.</p>
    <p>MP Alex Davies-Jones la­belled his com­ments “ab­hor­rent”, while the con­dem­na­tion was just as swift from the foot­ball com­mu­nity for us­ing “lazy, racist stereo­types”.</p>
    <p>For­mer Eng­land striker Stan Col­ly­more said Clarke was “flat-out racial pro­fil­ing”, while for­mer Tot­ten­ham for­ward Dar­ren Bent de­scribed the lan­guage used as “aw­ful, just aw­ful”.</p>
    <p>San­jay Bhan­dari, the ex­ec­u­tive chair of anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion group Kick It Out, said he was “ex­tremely dis­ap­pointed” by Clarke’s com­ments dur­ing his House of Com­mons ap­pear­ance via video link.</p>
    <p>“His use of out­dated lan­guage to de­scribe black and Asian peo­ple as ‘coloured’ is from decades ago and should re­main con­signed to the dust­bin of his­tory,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese com­ments in­di­cate that more still needs to be done to chal­lenge at­ti­tudes. For all the steps made for­ward re­cently, the com­ments ex­pressed to­day are a big step back­wards. Be­ing gay is not a ‘life choice’ as he claimed.”</p>
    <p>Within hours, Clarke’s words had cost him his job. In a state­ment an­nounc­ing his res­ig­na­tion later in the day, he said he had been think­ing about leav­ing his post even be­fore his in­flam­ma­tory com­ments.</p>
    <p>“My un­ac­cept­able words in front of Par­lia­ment were a dis­ser­vice to our game and to those who watch, play, ref­eree and ad­min­is­ter it,” he said in com­ments pub­lished on the FA’s web­site.</p>
    <p>“This has crys­tallised my re­solve to move on.”</p>
    <p>He later told Sky Sports: “I’ve en­joyed my time in foot­ball and will move back into the busi­ness world, hav­ing deeply ap­pre­ci­ated my time in foot­ball and the great peo­ple I’ve worked with.”</p>
    <p>Clarke will also step down from his po­si­tion as Fifa vice-pres­i­dent in Fe­bru­ary – he has opted against re­sign­ing im­me­di­ately to pro­tect Uefa’s vot­ing rights un­til then.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Le­ices­ter chair­man was ap­pointed by the FA in 2016 in a move to im­prove its stuffy image and be­come more in­clu­sive, but has stirred con­tro­versy even be­fore Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In 2017, he said at an­other par­lia­men­tary ses­sion that al­le­ga­tions of in­sti­tu­tional racism within the gov­ern­ing body was “fluff”, lead­ing to plenty of crit­i­cism even though he was not sanc­tioned for those re­marks.</p>
    <p>Bhan­dari wel­comed the FA’s de­ci­sive­ness fol­low­ing Clarke’s “stag­ger­ing” com­ments, say­ing: “We’re not just talk­ing about any­body here, we are talk­ing about the leader of our na­tional game on a re­ally ma­jor strate­gic is­sue for the FA, which is driv­ing greater di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion, mak­ing ev­ery­one feel they be­long in the game.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese were ar­chaic at­ti­tudes which were re­ally re­veal­ing... It is not as if this is the first time, there have been pre­vi­ous in­ci­dents. What it shows is there is an at­ti­tude un­der­ly­ing which is re­ally not the right at­ti­tude to be lead­ing the English game.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer and board mem­ber Peter McCormick will now act as in­terim chair as the FA be­gins the process to iden­tify Clarke’s suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>As­ton Villa and Eng­land de­fender Ty­rone Mings be­lieves the body would be tak­ing a “huge step” if it ends up nam­ing a mi­nor­ity candidate as his re­place­ment, adding we still “have a very, very long way to go”.</p>
    <p>“It would be ev­ery­thing that a lot of peo­ple have worked for... peo­ple more se­nior than my­self,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But ul­ti­mately, that isn’t what we’re ask­ing for. We’re not nec­es­sar­ily ask­ing for the next chief to be black. What we’re ask­ing for is equal op­por­tu­ni­ties for both black and white peo­ple, or eth­nic mi­nori­ties.”</p>
