    <p>Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents are will­ing to spend more on stay­ca­tions and also go on stay­ca­tions more fre­quently, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey con­ducted by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of Ser­vice Ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>Sixty-three per cent of the 450 par­tic­i­pants sur­veyed said they would main­tain or in­crease the fre­quency of stay­ca­tions, while 71 per cent said they would spend the same amount or more.</p>
    <p>This is in spite of the con­cerns some of them had about the cost, as well as how some ho­tels are used as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The find­ings were re­leased yes­ter­day to­gether with the Q3 Cus­tomer Sat­is­fac­tion In­dex of Sin­ga­pore re­sults for the food and bev­er­age (F&B) and tourism sec­tors.</p>
    <p>For the in­dex, 2,500 res­i­dents were sur­veyed be­tween July and Septem­ber. Re­searchers found that more than three in five restau­rant cus­tomers are or­der­ing more take­away or food de­liv­ery be­cause of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>This bodes well for those who ex­panded their op­er­at­ing mod­els to in­clude take­away and de­liv­ery, said the head of re­search and con­sult­ing at the In­sti­tute of Ser­vice Ex­cel­lence, Mr Chen Yongchang.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially crit­i­cal for op­er­a­tors who have tra­di­tion­ally tar­geted the of­fice and tourist crowd, where de­mand has re­duced sig­nif­i­cantly,” he added.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers are not only or­der­ing food de­liv­ery in droves, they are more loyal to restau­rants when they do so. Restau­rant cus­tomers who opted for food de­liv­ery scored 73.8 points for their loy­alty, while those who or­dered take­away scored 73.1 points.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, restau­rant cus­tomers who dined in recorded a score of 68.9 points.</p>
    <p>This is the first time the study has gone on­line to col­lect data on the F&B and tourism sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Data from pre­vi­ous years was col­lected from par­tic­i­pants face to face, so the re­sults can­not be di­rectly com­pared with this year’s.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels, which formed a sub­sec­tor un­der tourism in pre­vi­ous years, were not stud­ied this year as tourist re­sponses could not be cap­tured be­cause of the Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In­stead, lo­cal at­trac­tions such as the Sin­ga­pore Zoo, Gar­dens by the Bay and Univer­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore were fea­tured.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers stud­ied the fac­tors that would prompt cus­tomers to make a re­peat visit to an at­trac­tion they had vis­ited re­cently.</p>
    <p>Sat­is­fac­tion with F&B op­tions as well as the range of ac­tiv­i­ties and ex­hibits at the at­trac­tions were the most im­por­tant fac­tors in­flu­enc­ing cus­tomer loy­alty.</p>
