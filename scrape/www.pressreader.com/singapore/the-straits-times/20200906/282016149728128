    <p>PORTO JOFRE • A record amount of the world’s largest trop­i­cal wet­land has been lost to the fires sweep­ing Brazil this year, sci­en­tists said, dev­as­tat­ing a del­i­cate ecosys­tem that is one of the most bi­o­log­i­cally di­verse habi­tats on the planet.</p>
    <p>The enor­mous fires – of­ten set by ranch­ers and farm­ers to clear land, but ex­ac­er­bated by un­usu­ally dry con­di­tions in re­cent weeks – have en­gulfed more than 10 per cent of the Brazil­ian wet­land, known as the Pan­tanal, ex­act­ing a toll sci­en­tists call “un­prece­dented”.</p>
    <p>The fires in the Pan­tanal, in south­west Brazil, raged across an es­ti­mated 20,360 sq km be­tween Jan­uary and last month, ac­cord­ing to an anal­y­sis con­ducted by Nasa for The New York Times, based on a new sys­tem to track fires in real time us­ing satel­lite data. That is an area slightly larger than New Jer­sey.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous record was in 2005, when about 11,935 sq km burned in the biome dur­ing the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>To the north, the fires in the Brazil­ian Ama­zon – many of them also de­lib­er­ately set for com­mer­cial clear­ing – have been ru­inous as well. The amount of Brazil­ian rain­for­est lost to fires this year has been sim­i­lar to the scale of the de­struc­tion last year, when the prob­lem</p>
    <p>drew global con­dem­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The enor­mous scale of the fires in the Ama­zon and the Pan­tanal, sev­eral of which were vis­i­ble to as­tro­nauts in space, has drawn less at­ten­tion in a year over­whelmed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the up­com­ing US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts called this year’s blazes a par­tic­u­larly jar­ring loss and the lat­est eco­log­i­cal cri­sis that has un­folded on the watch of Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, whose poli­cies have pri­ori­tised eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment over en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tions.</p>
    <p>“The fires in the Pan­tanal this</p>
    <p>year are re­ally un­prece­dented,” said Dr Dou­glas C. Mor­ton, chief of the Bio­spheric Sciences Lab­o­ra­tory at the Nasa God­dard Space Flight Cen­tre. “It’s a mas­sive area.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bol­sonaro, who of­ten makes as­ser­tions that are false, said some of the fires de­tected by satel­lites were likely camp­fires.</p>
    <p>Own­ers of soya fields and cat­tle ranches – the main eco­nomic en­gines in the Pan­tanal – set fires on their lands dur­ing July and Au­gust, when the wa­ter level ebbs.</p>
    <p>This year, sev­eral of those fires skipped over tra­di­tional bar­ri­ers</p>
    <p>like roads and streams, pow­ered by strong winds.</p>
    <p>“Years back we faced large fires here, but noth­ing like this,” said park ranger Manuel Costa. “These fires are al­most im­pos­si­ble to fight.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the wet sea­son from Oc­to­ber to March, most of the Pan­tanal floods with wa­ter.</p>
    <p>But the Pan­tanal has been mired in drought this year.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers say drought in the re­gion can be trig­gered by warm sur­face tem­per­a­tures in the North At­lantic and North Pa­cific oceans. As these oceans con­tinue to warm in com­ing decades, they ex­pect more pe­ri­ods of ex­treme dry­ness.</p>
    <p>Last year’s fires in the Ama­zon in­cited a ma­jor global back­lash against Brazil.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing to bur­nish its im­age, the govern­ment i n July de­clared a 120-day pro­hi­bi­tion on fires in the Ama­zon and the Pan­tanal.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts said such mea­sures have served mainly to man­age the pub­lic re­la­tions cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Bol­sonaro cam­paigned i n 2018 on a prom­ise to make it eas­ier for min­ers, log­gers and farm­ers to gain ac­cess to pro­tected rain­forests. He has called en­vi­ron­men­tal fines an irk­some “in­dus­try” in the way of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, the Pres­i­dent lashed out at non-govern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tions that pro­mote con­ser­va­tion, call­ing them a “can­cer” he has not man­aged to “kill off”.</p>
    <p>Last year, the fires in the Ama­zon razed about 72,520 sq km of tree cover, a 10-year high. A sci­en­tist at Brazil’s Na­tional In­sti­tute for Space Re­search said the agency ex­pects to find that this year’s Ama­zon fire sea­son was about as de­struc­tive as last year’s, if not more.</p>
    <p>Mr Ail­ton Lara, the owner of a lodge in an area in the Pan­tanal that caters to tourists who come to see wildlife, said he de­spairs to think of the toll that the fires will take on an­i­mals, plants – and his liveli­hood.</p>
    <p>“We need to look at the root of the prob­lem,” he said. “What is hap­pen­ing now is a warn­ing, and the ques­tion is what we will have learnt from all of this.”</p>
