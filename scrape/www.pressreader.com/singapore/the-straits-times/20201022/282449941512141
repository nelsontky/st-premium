    <p>Tick­ets to the first two theatre pro­duc­tions with a com­mer­cial run since venues were closed on March 26 are sold out.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Reper­tory Theatre’s (SRT) Tues­days With Mor­rie sold out in four days while Wild Rice’s An Ac­tress Pre­pares sold out in a day.</p>
    <p>Tues­days With Mor­rie, which pre­views on Nov 1 and pre­mieres on Nov 4, sold out 49 per­for­mances. Ac­tors Ramesh Pan­icker and Ben­jamin Chow star in this stage adap­ta­tion of jour­nal­ist Mitch Al­bom’s best-sell­ing 1997 mem­oir.</p>
    <p>The lat­est gov­ern­ment ad­vi­sory re­leased on Tues­day said that live per­for­mances can re­sume on Nov 1 at des­ig­nated venues with up to two zones of 50 au­di­ence mem­bers.</p>
    <p>But SRT’s au­di­ence for each show is capped at 50 peo­ple, as per the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s (NAC) pi­lot tri­als and pend­ing NAC ap­proval.</p>
    <p>SRT’s manag­ing direc­tor Char­lotte Nors, 53, said the com­pany is ex­plor­ing ex­tend­ing the pro­duc­tion’s run, adding: “We are thrilled that our au­di­ences have missed us as much as we have missed them.”</p>
    <p>She said staff have been busy pre­par­ing the theatre space, which will be coated with an an­timi­cro­bial shield and have its seats taken out and re­con­fig­ured into a cafe-style seat­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Siti Khal­i­jah Zainal’s one-woman show An Ac­tress Pre­pares, on from Nov 4 to 22, had a sim­i­larly rap­tur­ous re­sponse, sell­ing out 23 per­for­mances in two hours.</p>
    <p>About 200 tick­ets were sold in ad­vance sales to Wild Rice donors while some 900 were snapped up by the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Wild Rice’s found­ing artistic direc­tor Ivan Heng said of the sales: “It’s a demon­stra­tion of the pent-up hunger for live per­for­mances.”</p>
    <p>Seat­ing is sim­i­larly lim­ited to 50 peo­ple a show at Wild Rice’s Ngee Ann Kongsi Theatre.</p>
    <p>There are no plans to ex­tend the run for the play, writ­ten by Al­fian Sa’at and directed by Aidli “Alin” Mos­bit, be­cause Wild Rice has other shows in the pipe­line. These in­clude of­fer­ings from its direc­tor’s res­i­dency and Young & Wild pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“This is very en­cour­ag­ing and gives us the con­fi­dence that au­di­ences will come back when we re­sume,” added Heng.</p>
