    <p>In the wa­ters off China, scores of mas­sive ships filled with Aus­tralian coal have been left an­chored and un­able to en­ter ports in re­cent weeks – a stark sig­nal of Bei­jing’s re­cent moves to in­flict trade pun­ish­ments on Can­berra.</p>
    <p>The move to re­strict trade of Aus­tralian ther­mal coal fol­lows sim­i­lar Chi­nese curbs on im­ports of var­i­ous Aus­tralian prod­ucts in­clud­ing bar­ley, wine, tim­ber and seafood.</p>
    <p>China has of­fi­cially de­nied pun­ish­ing Aus­tralia, pos­si­bly to avoid be­ing seen as breach­ing global trade rules. But Bei­jing has listed var­i­ous com­plaints about Can­berra’s con­duct in re­cent years, in­clud­ing Aus­tralia’s moves to curb for­eign in­ter­fer­ence, limit Chi­nese for­eign in­vest­ment and block Chi­nese tele­coms firm Huawei from par­tic­i­pat­ing in Aus­tralia’s 5G roll-out.</p>
    <p>Still, one prod­uct has con­tin­ued to flow into Chi­nese ports: Aus­tralian iron ore, a re­source that has helped to fuel China’s in­fras­truc­ture pro­gramme in re­cent decades.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia pro­vides about 60 per cent of China’s iron ore im­ports. In the year to June, Aus­tralia ex­ported A$76 bil­lion (S$76.9 bil­lion) worth of iron ore to China, more than half its to­tal ex­ports to China, which were worth A$150 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>But China’s re­liance on Aus­tralia’s iron ore, which is rel­a­tively high-qual­ity and well-priced, has prompted calls in Aus­tralia to hit back by tax­ing or lim­it­ing Chi­nese ac­cess to the pre­cious re­source.</p>
    <p>MP Matt Cana­van, a for­mer re­sources min­is­ter and a mem­ber of the rul­ing Lib­eral-Na­tional Coali­tion, has pro­posed im­pos­ing a 1 per cent tax on iron ore ex­ports to China, adding that the tax could be raised each time Bei­jing im­posed fur­ther pun­ish­ments.</p>
    <p>“Iron ore is the one prod­uct that China has not slapped tar­iffs or re­stric­tions on in its in­creas­ing trade war with Aus­tralia be­cause it can­not eas­ily re­place our sup­ply,” he wrote in The Aus­tralian news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>“To avoid fur­ther harm, we need to make the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party pay a price be­cause that will be the only thing that will stop fur­ther trade re­stric­tions.”</p>
    <p>He said the tax could be re­moved if China ended its trade curbs. Some com­men­ta­tors have also raised the prospect of Aus­tralia con­trol­ling the price or sup­ply of its iron ore ex­ports to try to re­sist Chi­nese co­er­cion.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Peter Jen­nings, a for­mer se­nior defence of­fi­cial, said Aus­tralia’s sta­tus as a sta­ble, cost-ef­fec­tive and long-term iron ore sup­plier was a “lever­age point” it could use to push back against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“If China could have found a re­li­able and plen­ti­ful source of iron ore other than Aus­tralia, it would have made the switch by now,” he wrote on the in­sti­tute’s The Strate­gist web­site. “We have a ma­jor lever­age point if the gov­ern­ment is brave enough to step in and start mak­ing con­trols around price and sup­ply.”</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment has made it clear it does not plan to re­strict such sales, say­ing this could leave it in breach of global trade rules.</p>
    <p>“We work un­der the rules-based trad­ing sys­tem, and Aus­tralia will meet its com­mit­ments,” Re­sources Min­is­ter Keith Pitt told ABC News.</p>
    <p>Other com­men­ta­tors warned that im­pos­ing a tax on iron ore would es­ca­late ten­sions with China and en­cour­age it to look to other po­ten­tial sup­pli­ers such as Brazil or West African coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Al­ter­na­tive iron ore sup­ply won’t come on­line im­me­di­ately – par­tic­u­larly not at Aus­tralia’s high grade and low cost – but over time Cana­van’s plan would slash Aus­tralia’s mar­ket share in China,” wrote Mr Stephen Bar­tos, a for­mer Fi­nance Depart­ment of­fi­cial, on the Crikey web­site.</p>
    <p>Most an­a­lysts be­lieve China would suf­fer if Aus­tralian iron ore flows were re­stricted. Anal­y­sis by Gold­man Sachs found China would be able to ac­cess only a max­i­mum of 56 per cent of its cur­rent iron ore im­ports if it tried to pur­chase only from non-Aus­tralian pro­duc­ers, ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg re­port.</p>
    <p>Still, China has shown it is will­ing to pay a price to try to demon­strate its anger to­wards Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s re­cent move to block coal oc­curred de­spite Aus­tralian ther­mal coal re­port­edly ac­count­ing for 57 per cent of China’s im­ported sup­ply for power sta­tions.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the sud­den stop to Aus­tralian coal ex­ports is be­lieved to be a fac­tor in the cur­rent power short­ages oc­cur­ring across China.</p>
