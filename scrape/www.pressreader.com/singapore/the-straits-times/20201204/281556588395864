    <p>The in­comes of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents took a hit not felt since 2004 be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to ad­vance es­ti­mates from the Min­istry of Man­power. The nom­i­nal me­dian in­come of res­i­dents – Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents – dipped 0.6 per cent to $4,534 over the year to June, down from $4,563 last year.</p>
    <p>The in­comes of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents took a hit not felt since 2004 be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to ad­vance es­ti­mates re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The nom­i­nal me­dian in­come of res­i­dents – Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents – dipped by 0.6 per cent to $4,534 this year, down from $4,563 last year.</p>
    <p>Af­ter tak­ing in­fla­tion into ac­count, real me­dian in­come fell by 0.3 per cent, a re­ver­sal from the 2.2 per cent growth the pre­vi­ous year. The in­come data is for peo­ple in full-time em­ploy­ment and in­cludes em­ployer CPF con­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>Those earn­ing less were more badly af­fected.</p>
    <p>Real in­come at the 20th per­centile dropped by 4.5 per cent not in­clud­ing gov­ern­ment pay­outs. MOM said this is due to in­dus­tries more ad­versely af­fected by the pan­demic hav­ing a high con­cen­tra­tion of lower-in­come earn­ers.</p>
    <p>The in­comes of lower-in­come self-em­ployed work­ers such as taxi or pri­vate-hire car driv­ers and hawk­ers were also im­pacted by the plunge in tourist ar­rivals, work­from-home ar­range­ments and sus­pen­sion of dine-in ser­vices dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June.</p>
    <p>MOM noted that if gov­ern­ment pay­outs to lower-in­come earn­ers are fac­tored in, such as the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment and the one-off Work­fare Spe­cial Pay­ment this year, the in­come level at the 20th per­centile this year is sim­i­lar to the level last year.</p>
    <p>Over the five years from 2015 to this year, the in­come growth of full-timers at the 20th per­centile (2.9 per cent per year) re­mained slightly higher than at the me­dian (2.7 per cent per year).</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey by hu­man re­sources con­sul­tancy Mercer found that about a quar­ter of or­gan­i­sa­tions here plan to in­tro­duce or con­tinue with salary freezes, slightly lower than the 30 per cent that paused wage in­cre­ments this year.</p>
    <p>It also found that about 3 per cent of em­ploy­ers said they in­tend to im­ple­ment pay cuts next year, com­pared with the 29 per cent which made salary re­duc­tions this year.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Des­mond Choo yes­ter­day urged em­ploy­ers to con­tinue to give the 13th month bonus this year. “To recog­nise the shared sac­ri­fices their em­ploy­ees have made, NTUC strongly en­cour­ages firms to pay the an­nual wage sup­ple­ment, par­tic­u­larly in view of the drop in me­dian in­come,” he said in a post­ing on Face­book.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est monthly up­date on un­em­ploy­ment given by MOM yes­ter­day, the over­all rate and the rate for cit­i­zens re­mained un­changed in Oc­to­ber, at 3.6 per cent and 4.9 per cent, re­spec­tively. The rate for res­i­dents rose to 4.8 per cent, up from 4.7 per cent in Septem­ber. This indi­cates the pace of in­crease in un­em­ploy­ment rates has slowed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the over­all em­ploy­ment rate for res­i­dents aged 15 and above fell to 64.5 per cent in June, the low­est since 2014 and down from 65.2 per cent a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“This was a smaller de­crease than in past re­ces­sions, helped by slower pop­u­la­tion and labour force growth,” MOM noted in its re­port.</p>
    <p>The an­nual re­port on the labour force is based on mid-year data. A sep­a­rate re­port in Oc­to­ber with pre­lim­i­nary data for the third quar­ter showed res­i­dent em­ploy­ment re­bounded af­ter the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said the Covid-19 cri­sis had a greater im­pact on the em­ploy­ment of for­eign­ers than on res­i­dents. Data on the for­eign work­force is not cap­tured in yes­ter­day’s re­port, which is why em­ploy­ment rates in it may not have fallen by as much as could be ex­pected given the ma­jor re­ces­sion, she said.</p>
    <p>Tri­par­tism played a big part in mod­er­at­ing the im­pact, she added. “Tri­par­tite ef­forts helped to avoid the worst, and we have a rea­son­able foot­ing upon which to strengthen the re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Although re­trench­ments and un­em­ploy­ment rates rose due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, co­op­er­a­tion among unions, em­ploy­ers and the Gov­ern­ment helped lessen the pan­demic’s im­pact on lo­cal em­ploy­ment rates at its peak, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said, not­ing their pos­i­tive re­sponses.</p>
    <p>The jobs that will ap­pear in Sin­ga­pore’s post-re­ces­sion econ­omy are likely to be dif­fer­ent from those that van­ished in the slump, and may be in fields that dis­placed work­ers are not fa­mil­iar with.</p>
    <p>For this rea­son, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) will fo­cus on over­com­ing skills gaps to give em­ploy­ers con­fi­dence to take on new hires and trainees, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This will be re­in­forced by the sup­port schemes in place, she added, cit­ing the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive which spurs em­ploy­ers to hire more lo­cals, the SGUnited trainee­ship and mid-ca­reer path­ways pro­grammes, as well as pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes and skills up­grad­ing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>She also said her min­istry is tak­ing a very close look at re­fin­ing and en­hanc­ing th­ese schemes “to bet­ter sup­port the need to close the gaps be­tween what em­ploy­ers are look­ing for and what the job seek­ers have to of­fer”.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was speak­ing at a press con­fer­ence on the pre­lim­i­nary mid-year data on the labour force, a re­port that cov­ers a range of in­di­ca­tors from em­ploy­ment rates and hours.</p>
    <p>Th­ese steps are nec­es­sary as Sin­ga­pore re­turns to a path of job growth in the cur­rent phase of re­cov­ery, and MOM will work with other agen­cies to en­sure eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties re­turn and have the chance to ex­pand, be­cause only then can job op­por­tu­ni­ties have the scope to grow.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ment of lo­cal res­i­dents – Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents – re­bounded in the third quar­ter, and Sin­ga­pore must build on the gains even as some sup­port mea­sures like the Jobs Sup­port Scheme taper off, she added.</p>
    <p>Although re­trench­ments and un­em­ploy­ment rates rose due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, co­op­er­a­tion among unions, em­ploy­ers and the Gov­ern­ment helped lessen the pan­demic’s im­pact on lo­cal em­ploy­in­comes to work­ing ment rates at its peak, she said, not­ing their pos­i­tive re­sponses.</p>
    <p>Unions and work­ers ac­cepted wage cuts, in­creased train­ing and re­de­ploy­ments while em­ploy­ers strived to re­tain their lo­cal work­force as the Gov­ern­ment rolled out schemes like the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age.</p>
    <p>“The over­all out­come is that when we looked at the peak of the pan­demic and its im­pact on the work­force, em­ploy­ment rates ac­tu­ally re­mained fairly high,” she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, young peo­ple aged 15 to 24 suf­fered the most, ac­cord­ing to the MOM re­port. The fall in their em­ploy­ment rate was the steep­est among all the age groups, drop­ping to 30.9 per cent in June, from 33.9 per cent a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is the sec­tors they tend to work in, such as food and bev­er­age, ad­min­is­tra­tive and sup­port ser­vices, and re­tail trade, saw em­ploy­ment shrink sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>But their rate has been on a down­ward trend in re­cent years as more young peo­ple fur­ther their stud­ies, MOM said.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, 28.5 per cent of older res­i­dents aged 65 and over were em­ployed in June this year, up from 27.6 per cent. This re­flects sus­tained ef­forts to boost their em­ploy­a­bil­ity and higher de­mand for es­sen­tial ser­vices such as clean­ing and se­cu­rity ow­ing to the virus out­break, it added.</p>
    <p>For res­i­dents aged 25 to 64, who make up the bulk of the work­force, the em­ploy­ment rate dipped slightly to 80.3 per cent, from 80.8 per cent last June. It re­mained close to the av­er­age of 80.5 per cent in the past five years.</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ment rate for men fell more steeply than for women.</p>
    <p>It dropped from 88.8 per cent to 87.9 per cent for men, the low­est level since 2004, while that for women dipped just a tad, from 73.3 per cent to 73.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>The res­i­dent labour force par­tic­i­pa­tion rate re­mained sta­ble, helped by ris­ing num­bers of ma­ture work­ers.</p>
    <p>But as the econ­omy reeled from the im­pact of Covid-19, a record num­ber of res­i­dents stopped look­ing for work be­cause they felt it would be fruit­less. This group swelled to 16,400, or 0.7 per cent of the res­i­dent labour force, in June. This is more than dou­ble the group’s size last year and higher than the pre­vi­ous peak of 11,100 in the 2009 re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Lower-ed­u­cated and older res­i­dents re­mained the largest groups among such dis­cour­aged work­ers.</p>
