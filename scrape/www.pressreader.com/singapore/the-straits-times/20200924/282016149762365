    <p>The fail­ure of the Euro­pean Union-China sum­mit last week to achieve any­thing con­crete sig­nals a new low in ties be­tween the two sides. This spe­cial gath­er­ing of lead­ers – which went on­line be­cause of Covid-19 – was to be where a Com­pre­hen­sive In­vest­ment Agree­ment that was seven years in the mak­ing would be con­cluded. But that did not take place and there were no agree­ments on other is­sues such as cli­mate change ei­ther. In­stead, EU lead­ers made ref­er­ence to trou­ble­some is­sues such as Hong Kong and Xin­jiang, show­ing that Euro­pean un­hap­pi­ness with the Chi­nese went be­yond trade. In­deed, Europe is reeval­u­at­ing its re­la­tions with China as it re­alises that its strat­egy of chang­ing China through trade is not work­ing.</p>
    <p>That the trade re­la­tion­ship lacks rec­i­proc­ity is a ma­jor griev­ance for the EU – while much of Europe is open to Chi­nese firms for trade and in­vest­ment, Euro­pean ones face bu­reau­cratic ob­sta­cles, forced tech­nol­ogy trans­fers, an un­even play­ing field and other hid­den pro­tec­tion­ist bar­ri­ers in China. But there are also grow­ing con­cerns among EU coun­tries over China’s as­sertive­ness abroad, its breaches of in­ter­na­tional le­gal com­mit­ments and its se­ri­ous vi­o­la­tions of hu­man rights in Hong Kong and Xin­jiang. The Covid-19 cri­sis has ac­cen­tu­ated many of these is­sues – not least be­cause of Chi­nese co­er­cive diplo­macy, but also be­cause it high­lights the risks of over-de­pen­dency on China in in­dus­trial sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>There is grow­ing scep­ti­cism about the fu­ture tra­jec­tory of the EU-China re­la­tion­ship and a sense of the need to look be­yond China to the rest of Asia. This can be seen in Ger­many’s re­cent pol­icy pa­per on the Indo-Pa­cific that makes the re­gion a pri­or­ity in its for­eign pol­icy and in com­ments by EU of­fi­cials. One key aim of the Ger­man guide­lines is to strengthen struc­tures of in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, in par­tic­u­lar Asean, with which Ger­many wants to co­op­er­ate more closely. Sep­a­rately, the EU’s chief diplo­mat Josep Bor­rell, in a re­cent op-ed, said the EU and Asean need to work closer to­gether to en­sure that their trad­ing sys­tems, pros­per­ity and se­cu­rity are gov­erned by rules and based on in­ter­na­tional agree­ments, not on the idea that “might makes right”.</p>
    <p>With the EU look­ing south of China to­wards Asean to di­ver­sify its re­la­tions, there are new op­por­tu­ni­ties for the South-east Asian bloc for its eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and geopo­lit­i­cal strat­egy. To make full use of these op­por­tu­ni­ties, how­ever, Asean will need to work on its own in­te­gra­tion. While the EU, the largest in­vestor in Asean, wants to step up eco­nomic part­ner­ship, a key con­cern is Asean’s com­mit­ment to free trade as it has failed to meet its tar­gets for in­tra-re­gional trade. And while the EU is keen to work with Asean on mit­i­gat­ing the im­pact of the pan­demic, re­gional co­op­er­a­tion on this is patchy.</p>
