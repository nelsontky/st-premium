    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, ca­reer paths within a com­pany progress along the lines of one’s area of ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>But with change be­com­ing a norm in many in­dus­tries, it is not un­usual for em­ploy­ees to switch jobs within the same com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Steven Lee, 38, started out as an as­sis­tant en­gi­neer, sup­port­ing the en­gi­neer­ing de­sign of oil rigs, when he joined marine en­gi­neer­ing firm Sem­b­corp Marine in 2003.</p>
    <p>He is now an as­sis­tant man­ager deal­ing with the de­sign of other up and com­ing ar­eas such as float­ing, pro­duc­tion, stor­age and of­fload­ing (FPSO) units and gas tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>An FPSO unit is a float­ing ves­sel which fa­cil­i­tates the pro­cess­ing and stor­age of oil and gas at sea.</p>
    <p>To up­skill and switch to a new job role, Mr Lee went through a pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme (PCP) for marine en­gi­neers in 2018.</p>
    <p>This was part of the com­pany’s ef­forts to over­come the chal­lenges of the oil price slump around that time and pivot to new growth ar­eas like re­new­ables and gas so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back on his switch, Mr Lee said: “It was a chal­lenge to fa­mil­iarise my­self with the FPSO and gas tech­nolo­gies that I was newly ex­posed to. For­tu­nately, my fel­low PCP trainees and men­tors were a source of sup­port and en­cour­age­ment. They read­ily shared their knowl­edge and ex­per­tise.”</p>
    <p>He added that soft skills such as com­mu­ni­ca­tion and teamwork are also im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee noted that the marine and off­shore sec­tor is still evolv­ing as busi­nesses move to­wards new ar­eas of growth in greener en­ergy re­sources.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore, with its strate­gic ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion and in­te­grated marine in­fra­struc­ture ser­vices, is well equipped to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties in new ar­eas of growth,” he said.</p>
    <p>This makes con­tin­u­ous learn­ing es­sen­tial, as the in­dus­try de­vel­ops and changes, he added.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant, he said, to “be hun­gry to learn new knowl­edge and take on new du­ties to grow and de­velop your ca­reer”.</p>
