    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Iskan­dar Wa­ter­front Hold­ings (IWH) has hired banks to help pre­pare for an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing in Kuala Lumpur to raise about RM5 bil­lion (S$1.64 bil­lion), in what would be the big­gest first-time share sale in the coun­try since 2012.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty firm is work­ing with Bank of China, CIMB Group, Citic CLSA and In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China on the planned IPO, ex­ec­u­tive vice-chair­man Lim Kang Hoo said in an in­ter­view on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper plans to sub­mit an ap­pli­ca­tion to the Malaysian reg­u­la­tor in two months, he said, adding that the po­ten­tial share sale val­ues IWH at more than RM20 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>It had aimed to list on the do­mes­tic bourse this year, but the plan has been pushed back to the sec­ond half of next year be­cause of the pan­demic, Tan Sri Lim said.</p>
    <p>IWH may con­sider a sec­ond list­ing in main­land China or Hong Kong after it goes pub­lic in Kuala Lumpur, he said.</p>
    <p>At RM5 bil­lion, IWH’s planned IPO would be the big­gest since IHH</p>
    <p>Health­care’s RM6.3 bil­lion sale in 2012.</p>
    <p>It would also give a boost to the Malaysian mar­ket, which has seen the low­est sum raised through first­time share sales in the year to date since 2000, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>IWH, which counts Mr Lim and the state gov­ern­ment of Jo­hor as ma­jor share­hold­ers, is the par­ent of listed real es­tate de­vel­oper Iskan­dar Wa­ter­front City.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also holds a stake in a joint ven­ture work­ing on the RM140 bil­lion Ban­dar Malaysia devel­op­ment pro­ject, which is set to be the hub for a pro­posed high</p>
    <p>speed rail line that would con­nect Kuala Lumpur to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ban­dar Malaysia was orig­i­nally con­ceived un­der 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had.</p>
    <p>When the fund was swamped by cor­rup­tion probes, it tried to sell a ma­jor stake in the pro­ject to IWH and China Rail­way Engi­neer­ing Cor­po­ra­tion (CREC), before can­celling the deal amid a dis­pute over payments in 2017.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­vived the pro­ject last year, sell­ing IWH-CREC a 60 per cent stake.</p>
    <p>IWH-CREC paid a RM1.24 bil­lion de­posit to the Malaysian gov­ern­ment on Tues­day, which in­cludes a RM500 mil­lion ad­vance, thus com­plet­ing its 10 per cent set­tle­ment for its stake in the prop­erty and trans­port hub, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>It has un­til Fe­bru­ary 2022 to pay the re­main­ing 90 per cent, he said.</p>
    <p>Ekovest, a con­struc­tion and engi­neer­ing com­pany con­trolled by Mr Lim and his fam­ily, is in ex­clu­sive ne­go­ti­a­tions to pur­chase 40 per cent of IWH’s stake in the joint ven­ture, ac­cord­ing to an ex­change fil­ing on Sept 8.</p>
    <p>At RM5 bil­lion, IWH’s planned IPO would... give a boost to the Malaysian mar­ket, which has seen the low­est sum raised through first-time share sales in the year to date since 2000.</p>
