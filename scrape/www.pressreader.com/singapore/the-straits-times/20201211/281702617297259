    <p>Fifty-three peo­ple were charged in court on Wed­nes­day with breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures meant to limit the spread of Covid-19, the po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 34 men and 19 women, aged be­tween 20 and 75, were charged un­der the Covid-19 (Temporary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The largest gath­er­ing in­volved 26 peo­ple who were al­legedly gam­bling in­side a unit in Gey­lang Road. They were caught dur­ing an anti-crime op­er­a­tion by the po­lice on Dec 1.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, two Singaporea­n teenagers were among the six new coro­n­avirus cases, all i mported, an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This takes Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,297.</p>
    <p>The Singaporea­n girls, aged 18 and 19, had re­turned f rom Bri­tain and were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>All the six im­ported cases were placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the two teens, the other im­ported cases were two other Sin­ga­pore­ans, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>One of the Sin­ga­pore­ans, a 33-year-old man who ar­rived from In­done­sia, was symp­to­matic on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent res­i­dent, a 54-year-old man, ar­rived from Pak­istan and started hav­ing symp­toms on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing t wo cases were asymp­to­matic and were de­tected through proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance, MOH said.</p>
    <p>One was a 47-year-old Singaporea­n man who re­turned from the United States, and the other was a 21-year-old Rus­sian de­pen­dant’s pass holder who ar­rived from Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>All the cases were tested while serv­ing their stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one case in the past week that was linked to a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
