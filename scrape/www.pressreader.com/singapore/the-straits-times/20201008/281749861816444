    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) will not take up the of­fer to man­age Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club’s (SICC) Sime Course as a pub­lic golf course ow­ing to fi­nan­cial con­sid­er­a­tions, the Min­istry of Law and Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Kep­pel Club, whose lease in Bukit Cher­min ex­pires on Dec 31 next year, has been of­fered the chance to op­er­ate the 18-hole fa­cil­ity in Lornie Road for the same nine-year pe­riod from Jan 1, 2022, to Dec 31, 2030.</p>
    <p>Un­der this ar­range­ment, Kep­pel will also take over the ex­ist­ing Bukit club­house, which in­cludes a golfers’ ter­race and ac­com­pa­ny­ing restau­rants, chang­ing rooms, as well as the 60-bay driv­ing range.</p>
    <p>“Kep­pel has the nec­es­sary ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence, and its in­volve­ment in the op­er­a­tion of the pub­lic course will pro­vide golf­ing ac­cess to a broader base of lo­cal golfers,” said the joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the Gov­ern­ment said it would not re­new the lease of Kep­pel and Ma­rina Bay Golf Course, which ends in July 2024.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter is the coun­try’s only pub­lic 18-hole course and is op­er­ated by NCI Golf, a sub­sidiary of NTUC. To en­sure con­tin­ued pub­lic ac­cess to golf fa­cil­i­ties, NTUC was then of­fered the chance to man­age one of the two cour­ses at SICC’s Bukit lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The min­istries last night said the Gov­ern­ment re­mains pre­pared to of­fer SICC a lease re­newal for the other 18-hole Bukit course up to Dec 31, 2030, “if both clubs are able to reach an agree­ment on the shar­ing of the cour­ses at SICC-Bukit”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s old­est and grand­est golf club’s other two cour­ses are at its Is­land lo­ca­tion near Lower Peirce Reser­voir, and the leases there have been ex­tended un­til the end of 2040. It has about 18,000 mem­bers, and mem­ber­ship fees are about $200,000.</p>
    <p>One po­ten­tial ob­sta­cle is Kep­pel Club’s lack of funds. In a no­tice on its web­site, the club said its re­serves are be­ing de­pleted due to Covid-19, cou­pled with its $1 monthly sub­scrip­tion – it was re­duced from around $105 to this nom­i­nal fee in April.</p>
    <p>Its monthly op­er­at­ing deficit has been around $850,000 since June and is likely to con­tinue, the club noted.</p>
    <p>It will have an es­ti­mated $25 mil­lion in re­serves at the end of next year, but this is in­suf­fi­cient to cover the pro­jected $31 mil­lion re­quired for the cap­i­tal out­lay of the new land lease, club­house, recre­ational fa­cil­i­ties and Sime Course.</p>
    <p>To raise the $7 mil­lion to $10 mil­lion needed, Kep­pel is ask­ing its mem­bers to opt in to a top-up scheme – $3,210 (so­cial mem­bers), $5,350 (or­di­nary) and $8,025 (cor­po­rate).</p>
    <p>It is tar­get­ing 1,500 mem­bers and has set a Nov 7 dead­line.</p>
    <p>Those who choose to opt out will be able to use the club’s fa­cil­i­ties at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic Grad­u­ates’ Guild and Sime Course for a year till the end of 2022.</p>
    <p>Re­tired lawyer Wil­liam Wong, 61, has been a Kep­pel mem­ber for 30 years and in­tends to opt in.</p>
    <p>But he is hes­i­tant about the pro­posed al­lo­ca­tion of golf flights – 40 per cent will be re­served for Kep­pel mem­bers and the rest open to the pub­lic – if Kep­pel takes over the Sime Course.</p>
    <p>He said: “If the monthly sub­scrip­tion, buggy fees are about the same as if I were a mem­ber of the pub­lic, why would I sub­scribe if I can try to get a slot as a mem­ber of the pub­lic?”</p>
    <p>In a let­ter sent to mem­bers yes­ter­day, SICC pres­i­dent An­drew Low said rep­re­sen­ta­tives from both clubs met on Mon­day and ex­pect to ex­e­cute the mem­o­ran­dum of agree­ment with Kep­pel later this year. SICC will hold a vir­tual di­a­logue with its mem­bers on Oct 20 to pro­vide more de­tails, he added.</p>
