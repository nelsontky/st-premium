    <p>Samsung yes­ter­day launched its lat­est flag­ship smart­phones, the Galaxy Note20 and Galaxy Z Fold2, amid un­cer­tain times cre­ated by the Covid-19 pan­demic, when con­sumers are ex­pected to guard their wal­lets more care­fully.</p>
    <p>The Korean con­sumer elec­tron­ics gi­ant also up­dated its tablet, smart­watch and in-ear head­phone prod­uct lines with new mod­els.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing its first vir­tual Un­packed event streamed live from South Korea, the com­pany said it is in the busi­ness of mak­ing life eas­ier for con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Samsung Elec­tron­ics pres­i­dent and head of mo­bile com­mu­ni­ca­tions busi­ness T.M. Roh said: “Tech­nol­ogy must make life eas­ier, not more com­plex. That’s why we have in­tro­duced five new... pow­er­ful tools to help you max­imise work and play.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany also told The Straits Times that its win­ning for­mula has al­ways been its strong prod­uct mix that caters to the needs of ev­ery con­sumer, and this does not change even dur­ing un­cer­tain times.</p>
    <p>“We of­fer an ex­pan­sive port­fo­lio of prod­ucts to cover dif­fer­ent price points (and) dif­fer­ent con­sumers,” said a Samsung spokesman.</p>
    <p>Also key to its growth strat­egy is stay­ing ahead of the in­no­va­tion curve by con­tin­u­ing to roll out the lat­est tech­nolo­gies such as 5G ca­pa­bil­i­ties, which the Galaxy Note20 and Z Fold2 will fea­ture.</p>
    <p>“The Galaxy Note20 se­ries is de­signed... as an all-in-one pro­duc­tiv­ity de­vice for users look­ing to get the most out of their phone,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sheng­tao Jin, an an­a­lyst at USbased re­search firm Canalys, said data shows there is still de­mand for lux­ury smart­phone mod­els.</p>
    <p>“Fail­ing to re­lease new flag­ship mod­els will cast a ma­jor blow to its brand im­age and risk los­ing (its dom­i­nance in) the pre­mium seg­ment to other com­peti­tors,” he said of Samsung.</p>
    <p>The Note20 se­ries will come in two ver­sions – the 6.7-inch Note20 and the 6.9-inch Note20 Ul­tra. In Sin­ga­pore, the Note20 will come with 4G ($1,398) and 5G ($1,548) ca­pa­bil­i­ties, while the Note20 Ul­tra will have only the 5G model ($1,898). They will go on sale here from Aug 21. Pre-or­ders start from to­day.</p>
    <p>Both ver­sions will have bet­ter cam­era fea­tures – such as zoom and tele­photo sys­tems – than their Note10 pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>De­tails such as the pricing and avail­abil­ity of the new Z Fold2 are scant. When folded, its outer screen fea­tures a larger 6.2-inch dis­play than the 4.6-inch dis­play of its pre­de­ces­sor. When un­folded, it opens up into a 7.6-inch tablet.</p>
    <p>Samsung does not com­ment on its com­peti­tors, but an­a­lysts said that Huawei is a force to be reck­oned with. In the three months that ended in June, Chi­nese hand­set maker Huawei un­seated Samsung as the top smart­phone maker for the first time by ship­ping the most num­ber of phones glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Huawei shipped 55.8 mil­lion de­vices, while Samsung shipped 53.7 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to Canalys.</p>
    <p>Canalys se­nior an­a­lyst Ben Stan­ton said Huawei had taken ad­van­tage of China’s post-lock­down eco­nomic re­cov­ery to reignite its smart­phone busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Samsung’s core mar­kets – in­clud­ing Brazil, In­dia, the United States and Europe – were still suf­fer­ing from Covid-19 lock­downs, he said.</p>
    <p>In a re­port re­leased last month, Hong Kong-based mar­ket re­search firm Coun­ter­point Re­search said: “For de­vel­oped mar­kets, the per­for­mance of Samsung’s flag­ship hand­sets will be the key driver for its growth.”</p>
