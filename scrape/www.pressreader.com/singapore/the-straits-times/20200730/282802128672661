    <p>ALAN TAM CLOSES INSTAGRAM AND FACE­BOOK AC­COUNTS: He may be one of Hong Kong’s most fa­mous singers, but Alan Tam (above) is prob­a­bly not one of its most pop­u­lar celebri­ties these days.</p>
    <p>Tam, 69, has drawn much crit­i­cism on­line in the past year or so for ex­press­ing sup­port pub­licly for how the Hong Kong po­lice and gov­ern­ment have han­dled pro-democ­racy protests.</p>
    <p>To es­cape the on­line brick­bats, he has closed his Instagram and Face­book ac­counts to fo­cus on his ac­count on Chi­nese mi­croblog­ging web­site Weibo, re­ported Ori­en­tal Daily News yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tam, known as Prin­ci­pal Tam for his con­tri­bu­tions to the Can­topop scene, is semi-re­tired af­ter a ca­reer that spanned five decades.</p>
    <p>In July last year, he was seen with fel­low singer Kenny Bee at a rally held in sup­port of Hong Kong po­lice.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, many fans went on so­cial me­dia to con­demn the singer, with some say­ing they would boy­cott him, while oth­ers smashed up Tam’s mu­sic records.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary this year, Tam was slammed once more when he was seen, along with sev­eral other Hong Kong stars in­clud­ing Jackie Chan and Eric Tsang, at a ban­quet with Hong Kong po­lice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Also draw­ing ire from ne­ti­zens was the group’s blase at­ti­tude to­wards the coron­avirus pan­demic, with the ban­quet at­ten­dees con­demned for not wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Many fans took to so­cial me­dia then to ex­press their dis­plea­sure with the singer. Since then, there has been hos­til­ity to­wards Tam on his Face­book and Instagram ac­counts.</p>
    <p>He started the ac­counts two years ago and his Face­book ac­count had more than</p>
    <p>10,000 fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Tam’s sup­port of the Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties has gained sup­port from Chi­nese ne­ti­zens, who call him pa­tri­otic. His Weibo ac­count has 4.7 mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
