    <p>Chil­dren un­der the age of five are at the low­est risk of be­ing in­fected by the coron­avirus from adults, as they may be more re­sis­tant to the virus, ac­cord­ing to a house­hold trans­mis­sion study. The risk of sec­ondary in­fec­tion in chil­dren was also higher if the in­dex Covid-19 pa­tient was the child’s mother.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren un­der the age of five are at the low­est risk of be­ing in­fected by Covid-19 from adults, as they may be more re­sis­tant to the virus, ac­cord­ing to a house­hold trans­mis­sion study con­ducted by the KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH).</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the study re­sults re­leased yes­ter­day, the adult-tochild trans­mis­sion rate among 137 house­holds was at 6.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>The risk of sec­ondary in­fec­tion in chil­dren was also higher if the in­dex Covid-19 pa­tient was the child’s mother.</p>
    <p>The youngest group of in­fected chil­dren – be­tween zero and four years old – had the low­est adultto-child trans­mis­sion rate of 1.3 per cent, com­pared with 8.1 per cent for older chil­dren be­tween five and nine years old, and 9.8 per cent for those be­tween 10 and 16 years old.</p>
    <p>Dr Yung Chee Fu, con­sul­tant at KKH’s In­fec­tious Dis­ease Ser­vice, said that this trend could be due to the lower ex­pres­sion of the an­giotensin-con­vert­ing en­zyme 2 (ACE2) re­cep­tors – re­cep­tors that the Sars-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 uses for host en­try – in the res­pi­ra­tory air­ways of younger chil­dren, mak­ing them more re­sis­tant to in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>ACE2 re­cep­tors are found in var­i­ous parts of the body, in­clud­ing res­pi­ra­tory air­ways, which are used as en­try points by SarsCoV-2.</p>
    <p>Other pos­si­ble rea­sons could in­clude dif­fer­ences in chil­dren’s im­mune re­sponses against the virus com­pared with adults.</p>
    <p>AROUND 4 IN 10 CHIL­DREN ASYMP­TO­MATIC</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate study of 39 chil­dren in­fected with Covid-19 be­tween Jan­uary and May found that 38.5 per cent of the chil­dren re­mained asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>There was a larger pro­por­tion of younger chil­dren who were symp­to­matic com­pared with older ones, with 75 per cent of chil­dren from ages zero to four ex­hibit­ing symp­toms, com­pared with 53 per cent in chil­dren from ages five to nine and 64 per cent in the 10 to 16 age group.</p>
    <p>Com­mon symp­toms in­cluded low-grade fever, runny nose, sore throat, di­ar­rhoea and loss of smell or taste.</p>
    <p>None of the symp­to­matic chil­dren re­ported short­ness of breath or de­vel­oped signs sim­i­lar to Kawasaki dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Higher vi­ral loads were dis­cov­ered in symp­to­matic chil­dren, in­di­cat­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of higher trans­mis­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, both asymp­to­matic and symp­to­matic chil­dren ex­pe­ri­enced peak vi­ral loads around day two to three of their di­ag­no­sis, sug­gest­ing vi­ral shed­ding and trans­mis­sion in the pre-symp­to­matic phase.</p>
    <p>All 39 chil­dren sur­veyed stayed in the hos­pi­tal for an av­er­age of 15 days. Their dis­ease was mild through­out and they have al­ready been dis­charged.</p>
    <p>YOUNG CHIL­DREN MAY NOT BE PRI­MARY DRIV­ERS OF COVID-19 TRANS­MIS­SION IN PRE-SCHOOLS</p>
    <p>The screen­ing of chil­dren from three po­ten­tial trans­mis­sions of Covid-19 in­ci­dents in schools – a sec­ondary school and two preschools – did not de­tect any ev­i­dence of Sars-CoV-2 trans­mis­sion among chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Close con­tacts of two Covid-19 cases – a five-year-old pre-school child and a 12-year-old sec­ondary school stu­dent – tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, when an adult staff mem­ber tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 at the sec­ond preschool, 16 staff and 11 cases from their house­holds tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>None of the 77 chil­dren iden­ti­fied tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Dr Yung said that the im­pact of Covid-19 on chil­dren ranged from asymp­to­matic to mod­er­ate rather than se­vere, but that the com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion among chil­dren has re­mained largely un­known.</p>
