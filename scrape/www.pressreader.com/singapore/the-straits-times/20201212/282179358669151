    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s am­bas­sador to the United States has re­sponded to a crit­i­cal New York Times ar­ti­cle about the ar­rest of civil rights ac­tivist Jolo­van Wham over an il­le­gal one-man protest, say­ing it would have had vastly dif­fer­ent con­se­quences had a few thou­sand peo­ple turned up.</p>
    <p>Mr Ashok Ku­mar Mir­puri added that Sin­ga­pore’s laws are de­signed to bal­ance the right to protest against the right of oth­ers not to be in­con­ve­nienced.</p>
    <p>“We make no apolo­gies for hold­ing to our own val­ues,” he said in a let­ter pub­lished in the news­pa­per’s opin­ion pages on Tues­day. “We do not try to im­pose them on other coun­tries, and oth­ers should like­wise re­spect our sov­er­eign right. In any case, we do not think ‘free speech’ as it is now play­ing out in the United States com­mends it­self to us.”</p>
    <p>The New York Times ar­ti­cle, pub­lished on Nov 23, was head­lined “Protest of One Leads to Ar­rest of an Ac­tivist in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Wham’s first il­le­gal protest took place in De­cem­ber 2018 out­side the State Courts build­ing and the sec­ond hap­pened in March this year near Toa Payoh Cen­tral Com­mu­nity Club and Toa Payoh Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>He was charged un­der the Pub­lic Or­der Act last month.</p>
    <p>In the ar­ti­cle, he is quoted as say­ing that the charges against him show Sin­ga­pore’s laws “have the po­ten­tial to be ap­plied in ridicu­lous and over­bear­ing ways”.</p>
    <p>In his let­ter, Mr Mir­puri noted that Wham had staged a protest in a pro­hib­ited area, and an­other with­out a per­mit, when he could have ex­er­cised his right to po­lit­i­cal ex­pres­sion legally. “If he chooses to break the law, then we must en­force the law,” said the am­bas­sador.</p>
    <p>He added that given how densely pop­u­lated Sin­ga­pore is, the ap­proach is to al­low pub­lic protests only at Speak­ers’ Cor­ner or with a per­mit, so that the au­thor­i­ties can as­sess the pub­lic-or­der risks.</p>
    <p>“Mr Wham protested alone. If in­stead a few thou­sand had gath­ered with­out a per­mit, the con­se­quences would have been dif­fer­ent,” he said.</p>
