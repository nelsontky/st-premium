    <p>• The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) raised the alarm on Thurs­day about a grow­ing Ebola out­break in the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo and warned of an im­mi­nent short­age of funds to fight the deadly dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion said 56 cases have been re­ported in Equa­tor prov­ince, more than the to­tal num­ber of cases recorded in the prov­ince’s last out­break in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to con­tain the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have com­pli­cated the re­sponse to the Ebola out­break, ac­cord­ing to Dr Mat­shidiso Moeti, WHO’s re­gional direc­tor for Africa.</p>
    <p>“We must not let Covid-19 dis­tract us from tack­ling other press­ing health threats,” Dr Moeti said.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent Ebola out­break is run­ning into head­winds be­cause cases are scat­tered across re­mote ar­eas in dense rain­forests.”</p>
    <p>WHO said in a state­ment that it has mo­bilised US$1.75 mil­lion (S$2.4 mil­lion) to com­bat the Ebola out­break, which was de­clared on June 1, but that will last only a few more weeks.</p>
    <p>Dr Moeti called for ad­di­tional fund­ing to help with vac­ci­na­tions, test­ing, con­tact trac­ing, treat­ment and health ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other Ebola out­break in the east of the coun­try was de­clared over on June 25 af­ter two years and 2,280 deaths.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Ryan, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of WHO’s emer­gency health pro­gramme who has worked ex­ten­sively on Ebola, said on Mon­day that as of the day be­fore, there had been 17 deaths from con­firmed Ebola cases and three more from sus­pected cases.</p>
    <p>He said that while the num­bers may ap­pear low, the threat of spread racy has more than a dozen po­lit­i­cal par­ties and the Pres­i­dent com­mands the sup­port of al­most 75 per cent of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Gibran thanked the party for the nom­i­na­tion and vowed to win the mayor’s post for the party headed by for­mer pres­i­dent is wor­ri­some, es­pe­cially be­cause of the ex­treme lo­gis­ti­cal prob­lems for health­care work­ers in ac­cess­ing re­mote, af­fected com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Any one of those in­di­vid­ual cases can re­sult in am­pli­fi­ca­tion of the dis­ease,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Moeti said over 12,000 peo­ple have been vac­ci­nated in Equa­tor in the six weeks since the out­break started, be­gin­ning four days af­ter the out­break was de­clared.</p>
    <p>Me­gawati Soekarnop­u­tri.</p>
    <p>Solo is con­sid­ered a PDI-P bas­tion, and Gerindra and Golkar, the other lead­ing po­lit­i­cal par­ties back­ing Mr Joko, have sig­nalled their sup­port for Mr Gibran.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s son-in-law, Mr Bobby Afif Na­su­tion, is also seek­ing a nom­i­na­tion from one of the top po­lit­i­cal par­ties for the mayor’s post in Medan in North Su­ma­tra, kumparan.com re­ported.</p>
    <p>More than 105 mil­lion vot­ers are el­i­gi­ble to par­tic­i­pate in the elec­tions for the post of 270 gov­er­nors, re­gents and may­ors, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
