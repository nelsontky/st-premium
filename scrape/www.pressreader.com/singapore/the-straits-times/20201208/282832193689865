    <p>A NEW MUM: Tai­wanese singer Lala Hsu (right) has given birth to a son.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Hsu, 35, posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of her baby’s an­kles with the name tag, “Lala Hsu’s son”. She wrote: “I just... gave birth to a child.”</p>
    <p>The new mother was con­grat­u­lated by many of her celebrity friends on so­cial me­dia, in­clud­ing singer Fish Leong, tele­vi­sion host Sandy Wu and ac­tress Florence Tan.</p>
    <p>Hsu’s hus­band, di­rec­tor Bill Chia, who is 11 years her se­nior, told Tai­wan’s Ap­ple Daily he was happy be­ing a fa­ther and that he felt tears welling up when he saw his child for the first time. The cou­ple mar­ried in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>Hsu was named Best Man­darin Fe­male Vo­cal­ist at the Golden Melody Awards in 2018 and held a con­cert in Sin­ga­pore in Au­gust last year with fel­low Tai­wanese singers A-lin and Rachel Liang.</p>
    <p>She had an­nounced on so­cial me­dia in July that she was ex­pect­ing a child and would con­tinue with her mu­sic ca­reer dur­ing her preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>She took a break from singing from Septem­ber as her due date was in late Novem­ber and early De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens noted that Hsu and her son are born in the month of De­cem­ber, with her son shar­ing the same birth­day as May­day singer Ashin and Hong Kong singer Hacken Lee.</p>
    <p>Ashin posted on so­cial me­dia pho­tos of him eat­ing noo­dles to mark his 45th birth­day, while Lee put up a pic­ture of a golf course-shaped cake to mark his</p>
    <p>53rd birth­day.</p>
