    <p>Many na­tions have a min­i­mum wage to pro­tect low-in­come work­ers. But com­pa­nies would just pay that with the salary not in­creas­ing there­after.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model (PWM), which</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam calls “min­i­mum wage-plus” (House sees spir­ited de­bate on is­sue of min­i­mum wage, Sept 4).</p>
    <p>It is a hy­brid model with a man­dated salary floor dif­fer­en­ti­ated by in­dus­try sec­tors, and ac­com­pa­nied by a ca­reer lad­der for the worker to earn higher wages over time through skills up­grad­ing.</p>
    <p>This is not an ar­gu­ment of which is bet­ter. The ques­tion to ask should be: What is the best way to raise the in­comes of the work­ing poor and yet avoid the neg­a­tive con­se­quences of a min­i­mum wage pol­icy, en­sur­ing that work­ers do not lose their abil­ity to stay em­ployed?</p>
    <p>A min­i­mum wage is a blan­ket salary floor value across sec­tors. But what is an ac­cept­able min­i­mum wage?</p>
    <p>An ar­bi­trary min­i­mum wage value may end up caus­ing more un­em­ploy­ment. This would hurt the low­est-in­come group in­stead of help­ing them. This is preva­lent in many coun­tries with a min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>The PWM over­comes this by pro­vid­ing the flex­i­bil­ity of hav­ing dif­fer­ent salary floors for dif­fer­ent sec­tors. In Sin­ga­pore, it is im­ple­mented in three sec­tors – clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scape – and wages for th­ese work­ers have in­creased.</p>
    <p>It would be good if Sin­ga­pore can move quickly to ex­pand this to other sec­tors. This is what we should be work­ing to­wards, not de­bat­ing to im­ple­ment a blan­ket min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>An­other im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion, in the light of the Covid-19 pan­demic, is to ask if hav­ing a univer­sal min­i­mum wage is help­ful dur­ing a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>When com­pa­nies are tight­en­ing their belts and jobs are scarce, a min­i­mum wage may push them to shut­ter if wage cost pres­sures be­come too great and there is no room for wage ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, the best in­sur­ance against un­em­ploy­ment is em­ploy­ment. For that, we need to bal­ance giv­ing fair wages and hav­ing jobs. If a min­i­mum wage ends up turn­ing away com­pa­nies, the jobs will dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>If the Work­ers’ Party feels strongly about a min­i­mum wage, it should move be­yond a cri­tique of out­comes to ex­am­in­ing the mer­its and de­mer­its of the pol­icy mea­sures to help the poor and ad­dress in­equal­ity. Show why th­ese poli­cies are in­ad­e­quate and pro­pose al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are not ide­o­log­i­cally fix­ated, so if a bet­ter pol­icy so­lu­tion can be found, we will do the right and prag­matic thing to help ci­ti­zens live a bet­ter life.</p>
