    <p>Fruit and veg­eta­bles top the list of food waste in Sin­ga­pore, mak­ing up al­most half of that gen­er­ated by the com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial sec­tors that han­dle fish, other seafood and fruit and veg­eta­bles. In this third in­stal­ment of a six-part se­ries on food waste, The</p>
    <p>Sun­day Times, in part­ner­ship with DBS Bank, gets to the root of the is­sue. Ju­dith Tan and Vanessa Liu join vol­un­teers as they swoop in to stem the prob­lem and give the pro­duce a se­cond lease of life, even as the food in­dus­try pushes to­wards zero food waste.</p>
    <p>As vol­un­teers dart in and out of the 30 or so stores lo­cated at Block 16 of Pasir Pan­jang Whole­sale Cen­tre, grab­bing boxes of un­wanted fruit and veg­eta­bles, the call rings out from nearly every ven­dor or a worker: “Wait, wait... There’s more!”</p>
    <p>It serves as a re­minder of not only the gen­eros­ity of the shop­keep­ers there, but also the scale of food waste in Sin­ga­pore, es­pe­cially of pro­duce. Fruit and veg­eta­bles, which do not al­ways take kindly to over-han­dling, are no­to­ri­ous for un­der­go­ing a strict process of aes­thetic fil­ter­ing in or­der to be sold in su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Dr Kenichi Ito, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of psy­chol­ogy at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, says su­per­mar­kets place spe­cific re­quire­ments on lo­cal farm­ers re­gard­ing the colour, size and shape of pro­duce, and con­sumers are less likely to buy “ugly prod­ucts” that they find un­ap­peal­ing to eat.</p>
    <p>“In my opin­ion, it could be re­lated to the ‘beau­ti­ful is good’ stereo­type. Peo­ple tend to as­cribe pos­i­tive feel­ings and good qual­ity to aes­thet­i­cally beau­ti­ful peo­ple, although their looks are not as­so­ci­ated with qual­ity. Such stereo­types could ap­ply to fruit and veg­eta­bles,” he says.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo Pei Shan, co-founder of start-up Ug­lyFood, says: “Sin­ga­pore­ans tend to want every­thing (to be) perfect and value for money. Some of them even add to the prob­lem by press­ing or squeez­ing the fruit or veg­eta­bles for sale with­out much thought, turn­ing fresh fruit into ugly fruit.”</p>
    <p>Food waste is one of the big­gest waste streams in Sin­ga­pore and the amount gen­er­ated has bal­looned by about 20 per cent over the past 10 years. The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency es­ti­mates that 40 per cent of food waste gen­er­ated in the coun­try is from the com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial sec­tors that han­dle fruit and veg­eta­bles, fish and other seafood.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mar­ket and con­sumer data provider Statista, Sin­ga­pore im­ported 535,339 tonnes of veg­eta­bles last year while pro­duc­ing 24,300 tonnes. The coun­try also im­ported 428,869 tonnes of fruit. Dur­ing the same pe­riod, around 744,000 tonnes of food were wasted, al­most half of which were fruit and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>The moun­tains of pro­duce deemed too un­sightly for sale, the stacks of boxes con­tain­ing still­fresh cab­bages and let­tuce left to wilt in the heat be­cause there is no space in the cold rooms, and bas­kets of over-ripe ba­nanas and pa­paya make up be­tween 15 per cent and 50 per cent of fruit and veg­eta­bles at Pasir Pan­jang Whole­sale Cen­tre. They are des­tined for the bins every day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Choon Huat, 50, a com­mit­tee mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore Fruits and Veg­eta­bles Im­porters and Ex­porters As­so­ci­a­tion, says: “Af­ter a long haul, the con­di­tions of some of the veg­eta­bles de­te­ri­o­rate and so they need to be trimmed. Trim­mings amount to be­tween 10 per cent and 50 per cent. As for fruit, those that are bruised or blem­ished will be dis­carded be­cause they do not at­tract cus­tomers. That is less than 30 per cent of those im­ported.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal farms like Yili Veg­e­ta­tion and Trad­ing say there is 30 per cent wastage dur­ing the process from har­vest­ing to qual­ity-check pack­ing – cit­ing cos­metic fil­ter­ing as the top rea­son.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple ac­cept only veg­eta­bles that are aes­thet­i­cally pretty, that is, with­out any holes,” says Ms Toh Ying Ying, busi­ness man­ager of Yili. Yili pro­duces an av­er­age of 720 tonnes of cai xin hua, xiao bai cai, sharp spinach, round spinach and kangkong.</p>
    <p>Blem­ished or not, most of the pro­duce is still fresh and ed­i­ble, and vol­un­teers are giv­ing it a new lease of life. No fewer than three groups – SG Food Res­cue, Food Res­cue Sengkang and Food Bank – are at the whole­sale cen­tre on dif­fer­ent days to cart away lorry loads in their bid to save food from be­ing thrown out even be­fore it reaches the din­ner ta­ble.</p>
    <p>It is do­nated to soup kitchens and char­ity or­gan­i­sa­tions that feed the needy, as well as to homes for the el­derly and fam­i­lies in need.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times team spent a Satur­day tail­ing vol­un­teers from Food Res­cue Sengkang as they col­lected dis­carded pro­duce and trans­ported it to 10 dis­tri­bu­tion points across Sin­ga­pore. They also set up a dis­tri­bu­tion point at Fern­vale Link for res­i­dents to col­lect</p>
    <p>the res­cued pro­duce. On that par­tic­u­lar day, the group col­lected 20 wooden pal­lets of pro­duce weigh­ing more than 15 tonnes.</p>
    <p>Founded by hus­band-and-wife team Derek Ong, 55, and Janet Lee, 43, the non-profit Food Res­cue Sengkang was launched in May last year to help Sengkang res­i­dents save money on gro­ceries and to put dis­carded food to good use.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple run Wizard Home Ser­vices, a lo­cal clean­ing firm.</p>
    <p>“When­ever we go down to Pasir Pan­jang Whole­sale Cen­tre, we split into two groups of vol­un­teers,” says Mr Ong. “One will go to the fruit sec­tion and the other to the vegetable sec­tion. We comb the two sec­tions si­mul­ta­ne­ously, ask­ing for fruit and veg­eta­bles that are dis­carded. Some­times we get more, some­times we get less.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lee adds: “Not all ven­dors give us blem­ished food items. There are many who also do­nate qual­ity items that are sur­plus and which do not fit into the cold rooms. Some re­serve items that are in perfect con­di­tion just so we have enough to dis­trib­ute.</p>
    <p>“We are also lucky to have vol­un­teer driv­ers from lo­gis­tic com­pa­nies who pro­vide trans­port.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong says: “In the be­gin­ning, there were not many vol­un­teers, only a few friends were help­ing. Right now there are more peo­ple vol­un­teer­ing be­cause they re­alise this is for a good cause. Af­ter all, we are cut­ting down on food waste, sav­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and help­ing peo­ple cut their gro­cery bills.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter col­lec­tion, the food is sorted into car­tons and dis­trib­uted in es­tates like Fern­vale and Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>IN IT FOR THE LONG HAUL</p>
    <p>We are com­mit­ted to cut­ting the amount of food waste, which poses a se­ri­ous prob­lem not only for Sin­ga­pore but also the world. By do­ing this, we also hope to ed­u­cate peo­ple that not all ugly fruit and veg­eta­bles should be des­tined for the bins. This way, we can work to­wards zero waste.</p>
    <p>MS JANET LEE, who founded non-profit group Food Res­cue Sengkang with hus­band Derek Ong.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee adds: “We do this to re­duce waste, and since the vol­ume is usu­ally way too much to do­nate just to homes and other char­i­ties, we de­cided to share it with our neigh­bours. Be­ing in a new es­tate, many from the sand­wiched class here tend to fall through the cracks, so we de­cided to help in our lit­tle ways.”</p>
    <p>The group also col­lects left­over bread from bak­eries on week­days and dis­trib­ute it the same night.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers from homes and soup kitchens col­lect the food and veg­eta­bles from the dis­tri­bu­tion points clos­est to their or­gan­i­sa­tions. Food Res­cue Sengkang does not re­strict any­one from par­tic­i­pat­ing in its ini­tia­tive, whether as a vol­un­teer or col­lect­ing pro­duce for their own use, “as long as they can ac­cept that these are res­cued foods”.</p>
    <p>As tes­ti­mony, there were dozens of res­i­dents stand­ing in two lines at Fern­vale to get some greens.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee says: “Derek and I are in this for the long haul. We are com­mit­ted to cut­ting the amount of food waste, which poses a se­ri­ous prob­lem not only for Sin­ga­pore but also the world.</p>
    <p>“By do­ing this, we also hope to ed­u­cate peo­ple that not all ugly fruit and veg­eta­bles should be des­tined for the bins. This way, we can work to­wards zero waste.”</p>
