    <p>Hong Kong movie stars Ca­rina Lau and Rosamund Kwan used to be good pals be­fore they fell out with each other five years ago. But it seems like their re­la­tion­ship is on the mend after the two ac­tresses re­cently ap­peared in a pho­to­graph to­gether.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Lau, 54, posted pic­tures of her celebrity friends at­tend­ing an event for a new video art project Al­ways I Distrust – which she ap­pears in.</p>
    <p>Kwan, 58, ap­peared in sev­eral of the photos. She and Lau also ap­peared in a pic­ture to­gether – their first time do­ing so since their 2015 feud.</p>
    <p>The duo had a very pub­lic fall­ing out tied to Kwan’s for­mer hus­band Pierre Chen, a Tai­wanese elec­tron­ics bil­lion­aire. Kwan and Chen dated for more than seven years be­fore get­ting mar­ried se­cretly in 2014.</p>
    <p>But j ust a year later, Kwan an­nounced they had parted ways.</p>
    <p>Lau got into the pic­ture when she was spot­ted go­ing on a hike with Chen prior to Kwan’s break-up an­nounce­ment, which irked Kwan.</p>
    <p>Kwan told me­dia re­porters then: “Do (Lau and Chen) have any con­sid­er­a­tion for other peo­ple’s feel­ings?”</p>
    <p>Lau, who has been mar­ried to film star Tony Le­ung Chiu-wai since 2008, was baf­fled by Kwan’s re­sponse and said then that she goes hik­ing al­most daily, some­times with friends of the op­po­site sex.</p>
    <p>She added that Kwan was “sen­si­tive” to the news per­haps be­cause her re­la­tion­ship was on the rocks and said that her hus­band Le­ung would not be so “im­ma­ture” to get worked up about her go­ing hik­ing with Chen alone.</p>
    <p>When asked if she and Kwan were friends, Lau said then: “I don’t even know if she’s mar­ried or di­vorced, I don’t think we’re best friends.”</p>
    <p>Kwan and Lau are both veteran film stars. Kwan is known for play­ing Thir­teenth Aunt in the 1990s mar­tial arts film se­ries Once Upon A Time In China star­ring Jet Li.</p>
    <p>Lau is known for her work in movies such as Wong Kar-wai’s Days Of Be­ing Wild (1990).</p>
