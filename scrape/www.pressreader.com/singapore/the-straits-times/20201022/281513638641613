    <p>Larger dor­mi­to­ries here will be au­dited at least once a week as part of a new pro­gramme to strengthen the im­ple­men­ta­tion of safe liv­ing mea­sures and min­imise the Covid-19 in­fec­tion rate in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day that a new In­fec­tion Preven­tion and Con­trol pro­gramme will be rolled out to all dor­mi­to­ries across the is­land, aimed at curb­ing the spread of fu­ture in­fec­tious dis­eases in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>De­vel­oped by the MOM’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group and the Min­istry of Health, the pro­gramme tar­gets dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors and staff, res­i­dents and MOM’s of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Au­di­tors will be trained to en­sure work­ers are fa­mil­iar with hy­giene prac­tices such as hand wash­ing be­fore meals, proper use of masks, keep­ing group sizes to no more than five, and re­port­ing sick when they feel un­well.</p>
    <p>Au­dits will be con­ducted by MOM of­fi­cers and about 100 vol­un­teers from the Sin­ga­pore Health­care Corps, of whom 40 are nurses fa­mil­iar with in­fec­tious dis­ease man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>MOM said the au­dits for the other dorms will be car­ried out dur­ing rou­tine in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a long, sus­tained bat­tle to sup­press Covid-19 in­fec­tions in dor­mi­to­ries, the au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day launched a new cam­paign to guard against fresh mass out­breaks that could de­rail Sin­ga­pore’s hard-won gains against the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures will en­com­pass ed­u­cat­ing mi­grant work­ers and en­sur­ing that liv­ing con­di­tions in dorms re­main safe, and that they do not be­come breed­ing grounds for in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dor­mi­to­ries with 500 res­i­dents or more will be au­dited at least once a week, un­der the In­fec­tion Preven­tion and Con­trol (IPC) pro­gramme launched by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day, to en­sure safe liv­ing mea­sures are in place.</p>
    <p>Au­dits for the other dorms will be done dur­ing rou­tine in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>Au­di­tors will be trained to en­sure that work­ers are fa­mil­iar with hy­giene prac­tices such as hand wash­ing be­fore meals, the proper use of masks, as well as mea­sures such as keep­ing to group sizes of no more than five, and re­port­ing sick when they feel un­well.</p>
    <p>As the de­tails of the pro­gramme were re­vealed yes­ter­day, the MOM’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment (Ace) Group med­i­cal direc­tor Lam Meng Chon said that while dorm op­er­a­tors and res­i­dents have started prac­tis­ing per­sonal and en­vi­ron­men­tal hy­giene, it is nec­es­sary to en­sure that stan­dards are uni­form across all dorms.</p>
    <p>The Ace Group is an MOM divi­sion that was launched in Au­gust to sup­port mi­grant work­ers and dorm op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The au­dits will be the last step of the pro­gramme, which be­gins with pre-train­ing quizzes to test dorm op­er­a­tors, staff and res­i­dents on their base­line IPC knowl­edge, fol­lowed by on­line train­ing.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that gaps are iden­ti­fied</p>
    <p>and cor­rec­tive ac­tion is taken, au­dits will be con­ducted in dorms from about five weeks af­ter the pre­train­ing quizzes are made avail­able to dorm op­er­a­tors, staff and res­i­dents, Dr Lam said.</p>
    <p>Dorms be­came a key bat­tle­ground in Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Covid-19, ac­count­ing for around 94 per cent of the cases here.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in dorms now have to un­dergo com­pul­sory ros­tered test­ing, while ef­forts are un­der way to re­duce den­sity in dorms by mov­ing some work­ers to semi-per­ma­nent struc­tures.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of</p>
    <p>the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said that the lat­est mea­sures need to be reg­u­larly mon­i­tored and prop­erly en­forced.</p>
    <p>“Many coun­tries around the world have put in place strict guide­lines around face mask wear­ing, but not many coun­tries have prop­erly en­forced the im­ple­men­ta­tion, lead­ing to a spike in com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Au­dits un­der the IPC pro­gramme will be con­ducted by MOM of­fi­cers and about 100 vol­un­teers from the Sin­ga­pore Health­care Corps, of whom 40 are nurses fa­mil­iar with</p>
    <p>in­fec­tious dis­ease man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam said the nurses will help to de­sign re­me­dial ac­tion spe­cific to the dor­mi­to­ries and the work­ers.</p>
    <p>The min­istry in­tends to make the IPC pro­gramme cur­rent, and will re­vise ed­u­ca­tional re­sources when knowl­edge gaps are iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Mr Alex Teo, head of au­dit at Cen­tu­rion Cor­po­ra­tion, which runs five Westlite dor­mi­to­ries here, said that the IPC frame­work is use­ful to teach dorm staff best prac­tices, such as don­ning the ap­pro­pri­ate pro­tec­tive equip­ment in var­i­ous places within dorms.</p>
    <p>“We have in­creased our man</p>
    <p>power in ar­eas such as se­cu­rity to man­age the move­ment of work­ers in and out of the dor­mi­to­ries. Thou­sands of work­ers en­ter and exit the dorms daily, so more staff are needed to en­sure safe liv­ing mea­sures are met.”</p>
    <p>Westlite Mandai Dor­mi­tory res­i­dent Srinivasan, who goes by one name, said the IPC pro­gramme’s videos are help­ful for work­ers to un­der­stand the safety mea­sures, as many have dif­fi­culty read­ing.</p>

Un&#xAD;der the new pro&#xAD;gramme, au&#xAD;di&#xAD;tors will be trained to en&#xAD;sure that work&#xAD;ers are fa&#xAD;mil&#xAD;iar with hy&#xAD;giene prac&#xAD;tices.</p>
