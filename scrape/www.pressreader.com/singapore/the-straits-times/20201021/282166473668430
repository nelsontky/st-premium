    <p>That the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) is closely mon­i­tor­ing com­pa­nies that en­gage in mis­lead­ing ad­ver­tise­ments is wel­come news (3 re­tail­ers ditch ads for sales that never seem to end, Oct 17).</p>
    <p>Us­ing wild claims like “clos­ing down sale” is an un­eth­i­cal busi­ness prac­tice when the busi­ness con­tin­ues for a long pe­riod of time with no end in sight.</p>
    <p>There are also store own­ers who ad­ver­tise “ren­o­va­tion sale” when hardly any ren­o­va­tion work has been un­der­taken at all in the shop.</p>
    <p>Equally un­scrupu­lous are re­tail­ers who price their mer­chan­dise on sale at, say, 60 per cent when those ad­ver­tised items were never sold at a higher price to be­gin with.</p>
    <p>One oft-used ad­ver­tis­ing ploy is the bait-and-switch tactic.</p>
    <p>I vis­ited a sports shop to get a pair of track shoes ad­ver­tised at an in­cred­i­bly low price, and was shocked when I was told that the ad­ver­tised model was sold out and was shown more ex­pen­sive footwear items in­stead.</p>
    <p>How that could hap­pen when I was among the few cus­tomers who ar­rived at the shop when it had just opened for busi­ness is any­body’s guess.</p>
    <p>To this end, the CCCS will do well to come up with guide­lines on truth­ful ad­ver­tis­ing, which means that stores must be equipped to carry an am­ple sup­ply of their ad­ver­tised prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>I am sure that con­sumer aware­ness will rise fur­ther when the watch­dog’s guide­lines on price trans­parency take ef­fect on Nov 1.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, there must al­ways be a fair deal be­tween the es­tab­lish­ments and the cus­tomers, even more so at this junc­ture where our retail in­dus­try is fac­ing chal­leng­ing times due to the pan­demic.</p>
