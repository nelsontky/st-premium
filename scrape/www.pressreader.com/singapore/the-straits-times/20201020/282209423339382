    <p>Singapore Post is look­ing to buy a 38 per cent stake in an Aus­tralian lo­gis­tics firm for A$85 mil­lion (S$82 mil­lion) in cash.</p>
    <p>It signed a con­di­tional sale and pur­chase deal last Fri­day with share­hold­ers of Freight Man­age­ment Hold­ings (FMH) and a share sub­scrip­tion agree­ment for the pur­chase, SingPost said in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When the ac­qui­si­tion is com­plete, SingPost unit Singapore Lo­gis­tics Hold­ings will set up a new firm in Aus­tralia to hold its in­ter­est in FMH, which is based in the state of Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>SingPost said the ac­qui­si­tion fits its strategy of “fo­cus­ing on op­por­tu­ni­ties in the fast-grow­ing Asia-Pa­cific re­gion”.</p>
    <p>Be­sides be­ing im­me­di­ately earn­ings ac­cre­tive, the deal will al­low SingPost to fur­ther de­velop its busi­ness-to-busi­ness-to-con­sumer lo­gis­tics ca­pa­bil­i­ties in Aus­tralia and cap­i­talise on the grow­ing e-com­merce seg­ment there.</p>
    <p>It will also al­low the com­pany to ac­quire a com­ple­men­tary tech­nol­ogy plat­form and dis­tri­bu­tion man­age­ment so­lu­tion, SingPost noted.</p>
    <p>FMH pro­vides in­te­grated sup­ply chain and dis­tri­bu­tion so­lu­tions to more than 500 busi­nesses across Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>It is an as­set-light, tech­nol­o­gy­driven “con­trol tower” busi­ness, SingPost noted, adding: “Util­is­ing its tech­nol­ogy, an­a­lyt­ics and net­work, FMH is able to match cus­tomers’ freight pro­file with the op­ti­mal car­rier, in­creas­ing ef­fi­ciency, util­i­sa­tion and prof­itabil­ity for both cus­tomer and car­rier.”</p>
    <p>Mr Damian De­gen­hardt, who founded FMH in 2000 and is its ma­jor­ity share­holder as well as manag</p>
    <p>FMH and its units recorded profit be­fore tax of A$20.3 mil­lion for the 12 months to June 30. A val­u­a­tion by Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers Se­cu­ri­ties in Aus­tralia val­ued the firm at be­tween A$182 mil­lion and A$217 mil­lion as at July 31.</p>
    <p>ing di­rec­tor, will con­tinue in his role af­ter the ac­qui­si­tion is com­pleted, SingPost said.</p>
    <p>It also noted that FMH has a “long-standing busi­ness re­la­tion­ship” with it, hav­ing been a cus­tomer of Couri­er­sPlease, a wholly owned SingPost unit, for many years.</p>
    <p>FMH and its units recorded profit be­fore tax of A$20.3 mil­lion for the 12 months to June 30.</p>
    <p>A val­u­a­tion by Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers Se­cu­ri­ties in Aus­tralia val­ued the firm at be­tween A$182 mil­lion and A$217 mil­lion as at July 31. The to­tal pur­chase con­sid­er­a­tion of A$85 mil­lion will be paid in two tranches.</p>
    <p>The first, es­ti­mated at A$58.8 mil­lion in cash, will con­sist of A$28.8 mil­lion for shares from ex­ist­ing in­vestors and A$30 mil­lion for the sub­scrip­tion of new FMH shares to be is­sued.</p>
    <p>That will give SingPost 28 per cent of the en­larged is­sued share cap­i­tal of FMH once reg­u­la­tory ap­provals have been granted.</p>
    <p>The se­cond tranche is ex­pected to take place about 12 months af­ter the first tranche.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated A$26.2 mil­lion will be paid to buy FMH shares from cer­tain in­vestors rep­re­sent­ing 10 per cent of the firm’s en­larged share cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>SingPost shares closed up 2.2 per cent at 69 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
