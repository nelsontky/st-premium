    <p>Prop­erty i nvest­ment can be a tricky busi­ness but en­tre­pre­neur Rhonda Wong be­lieves that spare cash should be put into real es­tate for long-term wealth preser­va­tion and growth.</p>
    <p>She cer­tainly prac­tises what she preaches – with six prop­er­ties in her port­fo­lio, in­clud­ing four over­seas.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong, 35, bought her home, a 3,723 sq ft four-bed­room free­hold condo unit in Robert­son Quay, in 2009, for over $5 mil­lion. It is on the high­est floor – the 42nd – and of­fers un­blocked views of the city.</p>
    <p>“A home is not just a place but a feel­ing. When my fam­ily and I walked into this unit, we fell in love with it at first sight,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong, who is mar­ried with a four-year-old son, is chief ex­ec­u­tive of Oh­my­home, a proptech com­pany which she co-founded with her older sis­ter Race in 2015.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has helped fa­cil­i­tate around 5,300 prop­erty trans­ac­tions in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Philip­pines with a com­bined value of $1.6 bil­lion, she said.</p>
    <p>Its app also pro­vides in­for­ma­tion such as past trans­ac­tion prices, rents and nearby ameni­ties to help browsers iden­tify a prop­erty suited to their needs and in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said the prop­erty mar­ket has re­mained re­silient over the past year, with a grow­ing trend in vir­tual view­ings and many trans­lat­ing into sales.</p>
    <p>“With the work-from-home sit­u­a­tion be­com­ing more and more com­mon, we have seen a grow­ing trend of buyers who pre­fer to have a home of­fice or workspace in the prop­erty that they in­vest in,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Many are also l ook­ing for homes with a larger space for their fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>While Ms Wong’s per­sonal prop­erty in­vest­ment ac­tiv­ity has been stag­nant in re­cent years be­cause she has been busy with her com­pany and its re­gional am­bi­tions, she aims to change that in the next three to five years.</p>
    <p>She in­tends to sell some of her prop­er­ties and buy a res­i­den­tial unit, likely in a con­do­minium – to make use of the ameni­ties – in ei­ther district 9, 10 or 11.</p>
    <p>“These are neigh­bour­hoods that I find con­ve­nient, and have restau­rants and cafes which my fam­ily and I en­joy,” Ms Wong said.</p>
    <p>“It will also be ideal to be close to my par­ents, so that we can spend qual­ity time to­gether, when­ever pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your prop­erty port­fo­lio? A I own six prop­er­ties – two are in Sin­ga­pore, three are in Malaysia and the last in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>I have a mort­gage on the two prop­er­ties here.</p>
    <p>Apart from the con­do­minium unit which I live in, the oth­ers are be­ing rented out.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your prop­erty in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A In de­ter­min­ing whether the prop­erty is worth buy­ing, I look at three fac­tors – lo­ca­tion, price and cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Lo­ca­tion is key to whether the prop­erty can hold its value. Es­pe­cially among Sin­ga­pore­ans, fam­i­lies now de­cide to buy their homes in ar­eas close to their chil­dren’s schools. Young cou­ples are also look­ing to buy their first home in a lo­ca­tion that is ei­ther close to work or close to their par­ents.</p>
    <p>The sell­ing price has to be within my means and has to make fi­nan­cial sense. I usu­ally will also de­ter­mine how the sell­ing price com­pares with re­cent and past trans­ac­tions, to see if there is op­por­tu­nity to sell in the fu­ture if I de­cide to do so.</p>
    <p>It is also important to note the po­ten­tial of pos­si­ble cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion... although some units in a de­vel­op­ment are well worth their pre­mium as they have out­stand­ing fac­tors that should not be com­pared with ex­ist­ing or past trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Q What’s your view of the prop­erty mar­ket?</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore has a sta­ble prop­erty mar­ket for wealth preser­va­tion. For in­vestors, it can be dif­fi­cult to make sig­nif­i­cant re­turns due to the Ad­di­tional Buyer’s Stamp Duty but it is also for that rea­son that the mar­ket has been re­silient, and not volatile in the eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>If I’m look­ing for a prop­erty to live in, I would look in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if my aim is to look at pur­chas­ing prop­er­ties for in­vest­ment pur­poses, cer­tainly ones with strong rental yield or cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion, then I would most likely ex­plore other mar­kets such as the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>In my per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence, it used to be com­pli­cated in­vest­ing abroad, es­pe­cially when you don’t of­ten visit the coun­try or have the right help on the ground. I re­mem­ber hav­ing to leave some of our in­vest­ments in Malaysia va­cant as we couldn’t find a re­li­able agent to rep­re­sent us.</p>
    <p>There­fore when we were con­cep­tu­al­is­ing Oh­my­home, I al­ways wanted it to solve such for­eign in­vest­ment mat­ters too.</p>
    <p>Q What’s your fi­nanc­ing strat­egy?</p>
    <p>A For my prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore, I usu­ally try to se­cure the max­i­mum fi­nanc­ing avail­able since in­ter­est rates here are at­trac­tive.</p>
    <p>For my prop­er­ties out of Sin­ga­pore, where in­ter­est rates are gen­er­ally higher, I usu­ally pre­fer to pay for them upfront in cash.</p>
    <p>Q What are some of your tips for in­vest­ing in over­seas prop­er­ties?</p>
    <p>A Typ­i­cally, be­fore I look at in­vest­ing in a prop­erty over­seas or in any mar­ket for that mat­ter, the one thing that I look at is the cred­i­bil­ity of the de­vel­oper. It is important to un­der­stand the track record of the de­vel­oper, to en­sure that the prop­erty is de­liv­ered as promised and to en­sure that the qual­ity and standard will be up to par.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, with in­for­ma­tion on the de­vel­oper, the as­set and price points, I can also better grasp the liq­uid­ity of the prop­erty.</p>
    <p>If you are an in­ex­pe­ri­enced in­vestor in a for­eign mar­ket, it is important to un­der­stand the for­eign buy­ing reg­u­la­tions and the prop­erty leg­is­la­tion in that coun­try.</p>
    <p>My ad­vice would be to work with a rep­utable con­sul­tancy that will pro­tect your in­ter­est and meet your in­vest­ment needs. While some buyers like to buy di­rectly from the de­vel­op­ers, I be­lieve that it is important to work with an agent so that he or she can pro­vide an un­bi­ased view, and work with the de­vel­op­ers to meet your needs, with­out a con­flict of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Once you have de­cided to in­vest in a prop­erty out­side of your home coun­try, it is equally important to have a team on the ground, who will help you look af­ter your prop­erty. While it may seem sim­ple, ten­ant scout­ing, rental col­lec­tion and gen­eral main­te­nance of the prop­erty can be a cause for con­cern and stress, es­pe­cially when the owner lives in an­other coun­try.</p>
    <p>Q What’s your over­all in­vest­ing strat­egy?</p>
    <p>A At the mo­ment, my in­vest­ment port­fo­lio con­sists of mainly the prop­er­ties that I own. I used to be a de­riv­a­tives trader and def­i­nitely en­joyed it very much. How­ever, since start­ing Oh­my­home, I have stopped trad­ing and now fo­cus all of my at­ten­tion on the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your dream home.</p>
    <p>A My dream home would be a house by the wa­ter with a huge gar­den. I also hope to have my own sta­ble of horses some­day.</p>
    <p>In my opinion, a home is a very in­ti­mate part of our life and I would love to have a ton of space that my fam­ily and I can en­joy and call our own and have lots of chil­dren, both bi­o­log­i­cal and adopted.</p>
    <p>I think that it’s such a priv­i­lege to be able to pro­vide a home for chil­dren and raise them to, hope­fully, some­day con­trib­ute to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>My hus­band grew up in Aus­tralia and since we both love chil­dren and greatly en­joy the out­doors, we hope we can spend fam­ily time out on the wa­ter pad­dle-board­ing or kayak­ing and maybe camp­ing and horse rid­ing too.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ti­cally, in Sin­ga­pore how­ever, space is def­i­nitely a huge lux­ury and I will be con­tent with a home that is com­fort­able enough for my fam­ily and with space to en­ter­tain guests.</p>
