    <p>Are boys not read­ing as much as girls? Data from the 2018 Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent As­sess­ment study shows boys read fewer books, but first-time au­thor Dar­ren Lim, 34, begs to dif­fer.</p>
    <p>“Kids these days, not just boys, have so many more op­tions for fun, it’s no sur­prise that books aren’t al­ways the top choice,” he says.</p>
    <p>He re­calls go­ing to book­stores and li­braries fre­quently with his par­ents when he was young.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways got to pick out what I wanted to read,” he says, adding that if par­ents want their kids to be avid read­ers, they should let them do that too.</p>
    <p>“When chil­dren read books about sub­jects that in­ter­est them, it keeps them go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Lim, who is sin­gle, con­fesses that he does not read for plea­sure as much as he used to these days. “Life hap­pens. And writ­ing Spy­cat books does take up a lot of my free time.”</p>
    <p>He pub­lished Ace Agent Spy­cat And The Fly­ing Side­kick, the first book in his Spy­cat se­ries, in July.</p>
    <p>Rec­om­mended for kids from age eight, the ad­ven­ture se­ries re­lates the es­capades of Spy­cat, a Sin­ga­pore agent with a crime-fight­ing or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked if it was tar­geted at boys, he says: “I as­sumed that my­self too. But to my de­light, I’ve ob­served that my au­di­ence is an even split be­tween boys and girls.</p>
    <p>“I think fea­tur­ing an­thro­po­mor­phic an­i­mals and hav­ing a funny yet thrilling story helped to widen the book’s ap­peal.”</p>
    <p>The book is based on an an­i­mated short film, Spy­cat And The Pa­per Chase (2011), his fi­nal-year project as an an­i­ma­tion stu­dent at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s School of Art, De­sign and Me­dia.</p>
    <p>It has been screened at an­i­ma­tion and chil­dren’s film fes­ti­vals world­wide and its ac­co­lades in­clude a Gryphon Award for Best Short Film from the 2012 Gif­foni Film Fes­ti­val in Italy.</p>
    <p>“This award was an un­ex­pected win, es­pe­cially since the Spy­cat film was up against works from pro­fes­sional stu­dios and the like,” says Lim, who is writ­ing at least two more ti­tles in the se­ries.</p>
    <p>“It is voted by hun­dreds of chil­dren who at­tend the fes­ti­val, which I find es­pe­cially mean­ing­ful. Who bet­ter to say what chil­dren like, than the chil­dren them­selves?”</p>
