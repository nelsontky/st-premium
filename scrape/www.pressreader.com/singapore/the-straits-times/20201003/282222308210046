    <p>With their flat bod­ies that re­sem­ble the trim­mings of a skirt, marine flat­worms al­ways seem to be danc­ing through life.</p>
    <p>But they are not al­ways so gen­tle and can get quite frisky while mat­ing – to the de­light of scuba divers, who of­ten try to cap­ture on video the process that can take from a few minutes to more than an hour.</p>
    <p>Marine flat­worms, also known as poly­clad flat­worms, are hermaphrod­ites – each in­di­vid­ual pos­sesses both male and fe­male re­pro­duc­tive or­gans.</p>
    <p>When they come to­gether to mate, a bat­tle for par­ent­hood en­sues: Each flat­worm tries to use its male or­gan to in­ject sperm into the other’s body while try­ing to avoid get­ting stabbed.</p>
    <p>This is known as pe­nis fenc­ing. “This rit­ual is what marine flat­worms are known for, and divers try to cap­ture that on video,” said Ms Rene Ong, who did re­search on poly­clad flat­worms at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Trop­i­cal Marine Sci­ence In­sti­tute (TMSI).</p>
    <p>A re­cent TMSI study that in­volved Ms Ong and an­other re­searcher found that not all flat­worms in Sin­ga­pore mate in this man­ner.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic is home to 128 species of marine flat­worms, found largely around the coun­try’s north­ern and south­ern shores, in­clud­ing the sur­round­ing is­lands.</p>
    <p>One species, Pseu­do­biceros stel­lae, also known as the starry flat­worm, was ob­served to have a more “ro­man­tic” mat­ing rit­ual.</p>
    <p>Like ball­room dancers, a pair of these flat­worms would swim around in a cir­cu­lar mo­tion while curled around each other.</p>
    <p>This was a key find­ing from the study – pub­lished re­cently in sci­en­tific jour­nal In­ver­te­brate Bi­ol­ogy – which looked into the rel­a­tively un­der­stud­ied re­pro­duc­tive be­hav­iour of 16 marine flat­worms and how their eggs de­velop over time.</p>
    <p>The 16 species are part of the big­gest fam­ily of poly­clad flat­worms, called Pseu­do­ceroti­dae.</p>
    <p>With the study’s find­ings, the cur­rent in­for­ma­tion on the re­pro­duc­tive be­hav­iour of this fam­ily has in­creased by around twothirds.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers also found that two species brood, or sit over their eggs, for about two weeks, un­like most other species, which guard their eggs for a day.</p>
    <p>The two species – the blue-lined flat­worm and the pur­ple-spot­ted flat­worm – lay a smaller num­ber of eggs than the oth­ers, and their off­spring take a longer time to de­velop.</p>
    <p>These two species l ay fewer than 1,000 eggs, while oth­ers lay thou­sands of eggs.</p>
    <p>“It is pos­si­ble that longer parental care for the two flat­worms was needed to in­crease the sur­vival (chances) of their eggs and pro­tect them from po­ten­tial preda­tors,” said Ms Sa­man­tha Tong, a TMSI re­search as­sis­tant and lead au­thor of the pa­per.</p>
    <p>There are gen­er­ally three types of worms – round­worms, which can live in the in­testines of hu­man be­ings; seg­mented worms, such as earth­worms; and flat­worms.</p>
    <p>The marine flat­worm, one of many kinds of flat­worm, is only a few mil­lime­tres thick and can be found creep­ing and glid­ing along co­ral reefs, rocky shores, mud­flats and sea­grass, in shal­low parts of the sea.</p>
    <p>NUS marine bi­ol­o­gist Huang Dan­wei said the flat­worms’ sim­ple anatomy al­lows them to be ex­tremely adapt­able to dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>“They also have key roles across marine ecosys­tems, in­clud­ing as preda­tors keep­ing prey pop­u­la­tions in check, and as scavengers help­ing to re­cy­cle nu­tri­ents,” he added.</p>
