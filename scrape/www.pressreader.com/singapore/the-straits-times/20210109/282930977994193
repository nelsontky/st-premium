    <p>There are some songs that have lyrics so sat­u­rat­ing of our psy­che that they seem al­most in­nate; that have crowds rais­ing their drinks and bel­low­ing along to the cho­rus in a dive bar at 2am… well, maybe not that, at least not now.</p>
    <p>But what if that song that seems to be play­ing ev­ery­where has an un­canny res­o­nance? What if that song is ac­tu­ally about you?</p>
    <p>Songs named af­ter peo­ple have long been part of the pop cul­ture land­scape – Dolly Par­ton’s Jo­lene, the elu­sive Lola name-dropped by the Kinks, the mys­te­ri­ous Rox­anne (St­ing, Ari­zona Zer­vas).</p>
    <p>Tay­lor Swift’s new al­bum, Ever­more, has two tracks named af­ter women – Mar­jorie ap­pears to be in­spired by Swift’s grand­mother. The other one, Dorothea, has set the In­ter­net alive with de­bate about its in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>All this is very fa­mil­iar to Valerie Star, a make-up artist.</p>
    <p>In 2006, English singer-song­writer Dave McCabe, whom she had dated for a short time, wrote an in­die rock song about their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Their heady ro­mance was cut short when Ms Star was ar­rested on charges of driv­ing un­der the in­flu­ence, and McCabe’s mu­si­cal trib­ute served as a sort of wist­ful love let­ter to her.</p>
    <p>Played by McCabe’s band The Zu­tons, the song peaked at No. 9 on the Bri­tish charts.</p>
    <p>It might have faded into ob­scu­rity but for the in­ter­est of Amy Wine­house, who recorded a ver­sion of Valerie with Mark Ron­son. The rest is a his­tory writ­ten in end­less cov­ers and, at one time, karaoke ren­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“That’s when I re­ally started hear­ing the song out and about ran­domly, in movies, and com­mer­cials. It’s ev­ery­where,” Ms Star said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“It was a bril­liant song and I loved ev­ery­thing about it. It de­scribed that mo­ment in my life and those tri­als and tribu­la­tions that I had gone through in the most quin­tes­sen­tial way. I would never change a thing about the rea­sons why that song hap­pened, the things that put me in that sit­u­a­tion or any­thing about Dave and I.”</p>
    <p>Like The Zu­tons, whose other al­most-hit track was Oh Stacey (Look What You’ve Done), Swift has name-dropped many times in her lyrics.</p>
    <p>Betty was spec­u­lated to be Kar­lie Kloss (whose mid­dle name is El­iz­a­beth) and Re­bekah Hark­ness (who is said to have used Betty as a nick­name), be­fore Swift even­tu­ally con­firmed that the song was named af­ter Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ youngest daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>And who could for­get the hit sin­gle Style, sup­pos­edly based on Swift’s ro­mance with Harry Styles? Or her back cat­a­logue clas­sic Hey Stephen, a song in­spired by Swift’s teenage crush?</p>
    <p>The iden­tity of the woman that Swift sings about in her l at­est record may never be re­vealed, if she even ex­ists, but if she does, then Ms Sharona Alperin, the sub­ject of The Knack’s 1979 hit My</p>
    <p>Sharona, may have some wis­dom to im­part.</p>
    <p>Ms Alperin was in­tro­duced to the lead singer of The Knack, Doug Fieger, when she was working in a cloth­ing store, by his girl­friend at the time, and was in­vited to hear the band play at a re­hearsal stu­dio.</p>
    <p>“Soon af­ter he met me, he took me to lunch and told me he was in love with me,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I thought it was sweet, but he was 11 years older and I had a boyfriend at the time who I was madly in love with.”</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, Fieger won Ms Alperin af­ter writ­ing the catchy bass-driven track about her.</p>
    <p>She spent her late teens tour­ing the world with him, with the song that pleads with her to “give me some time” be­ing the high­light of ev­ery show.</p>
    <p>“It played ev­ery­where I went,” Ms Alperin re­called. “It was in the el­e­va­tor, it was in the den­tist, it was on the air­plane, in the mar­ket, played by ev­ery Top 40 band. It was ev­ery­where. It was ex­cit­ing and it was ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>And then, by the time she was 21, it was enough.</p>
    <p>“When we broke up, it was time to be ‘my’ Sharona,” Ms Alperin said. “The word ‘my’ in that song says a lot. There’s not more of a pos­ses­sive or ob­ses­sive word in the English vo­cab­u­lary. He thought I was his soul mate, his other half, but it was a lot.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, while many were charmed by the Plain White T’s 2006 love song Hey There Delilah, the real Delilah DiCrescenz­o was some­what less so.</p>
    <p>Ms DiCrescenz­o was liv­ing in New York City at the time – as crooned plain­tively in the open­ing lines – and she re­ported be­ing stunned when a brief en­counter led to her be­ing name-checked.</p>
    <p>In a 2013 in­ter­view, she re­mem­bered be­ing anx­ious that she had led song­writer Tom Higgen­son on, feel­ing the pres­sure to live up to the ex­pec­ta­tions of fans and wor­ry­ing about the im­pact on her fledg­ling ath­letic ca­reer.</p>
    <p>And these women were writ­ten about be­fore so­cial me­dia truly took off. The on­line furore to un­cover the iden­tity of Bey­once’s “Becky with the good hair”, framed as the singer’s ri­val in the song Sorry on her sixth al­bum Lemon­ade, re­flects how an era of less­ened pri­vacy means that be­ing the sub­ject of a song can now be much more in­va­sive.</p>
    <p>“My Sharona was writ­ten be­fore so­cial me­dia,” Ms Alperin said. “Things are very dif­fer­ent now and I feel that I wouldn’t have had the pri­vacy that I have now if it had been writ­ten to­day.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, Ms Star man­aged to keep her iden­tity a se­cret un­til 2019, when she was tracked down by Vice mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>But al­though she said she has now re­moved Valerie from her playlists and avoids bring­ing up the con­nec­tion to the song on a first date, par­tic­u­larly with other mu­si­cians, she has no re­grets about what she called “a part of my life, a mo­ment in time that has tran­spired, that will live for­ever, ‘Valerie’ has made a mark that has now taken on a life of its own. I wouldn’t change any­thing about it.”</p>
