    <p>By the yard­sticks of his two dozen or so rus­tic cousins, Mr Ravi Thakran would have been a suc­cess if he had ful­filled his first am­bi­tion: to be a truck driver with Jaipur Golden, a fleet op­er­a­tor re­puted for pro­vid­ing its staff with smart uni­forms and paid an­nual leave.</p>
    <p>After all, for many of them, their own fu­tures lay in be­ing wrestlers, bounc­ers – and for those es­pe­cially for­tu­nate and able – the low­est rungs of In­dia’s army or po­lice forces.</p>
    <p>His barely lit­er­ate par­ents, who raised buf­faloes in Haryana, a pre­dom­i­nantly farm­ing state that abuts New Delhi, had a leap of faith, how­ever, and in­sisted they would in­vest in his ed­u­ca­tion. En­rolled at Jin­dal Pub­lic School, a two-hour jour­ney by rick­shaw and bus from his vil­lage, Mr Thakran was nearly 13 when he be­gan English lessons.</p>
    <p>The ur­ban, mid­dle-class chil­dren he en­coun­tered were amused at the lamp-black his mother lined his eyes with and cu­ri­ous about the smells em­a­nat­ing from his slicked-down hair, soaked in veg­etable oils con­sid­ered to have medic­i­nal prop­er­ties. Ques­tions about what sham­poo he used would fetch a blank stare; he wasn’t fa­mil­iar with the prod­uct.</p>
    <p>“My big­gest chal­lenge,” he says, “was to as­sim­i­late with my new­found co­hort.”</p>
    <p>The uni­verse Mr Thakran, 57, now oc­cu­pies is vastly dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>He has just ended a two-decade-long ca­reer with lux­ury house LVMH, own­ers of brands such as Hen­nessy, Moet & Chan­don, Louis Vuit­ton, Fendi, Bul­gari and Hublot, where he rose to be group chair­man for South/South-east Asia and Aus­tralia/New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Along the way, as the found­ing head of pri­vate eq­uity fund L Cap­i­tal, now called L Cat­ter­ton, he ac­quired a rep­u­ta­tion as a savvy in­vestor with picks like China’s Sasseur lux­ury out­let malls, Sin­ga­pore’s Charles & Keith, and In­dia’s Fabindia.</p>
    <p>In­deed, as­sim­i­la­tion – whether in Sin­ga­pore, China, or with his neigh­bours at the hol­i­day home he and his artist wife Holly Turner have built in Medellin, Colom­bia – is hardly an is­sue for Mr Thakran, who once hosted for­mer United States Pres­i­dent Barack Obama in his Sin­ga­pore home.</p>
    <p>There, a Maserati shares base­ment space with a Ja­panese-made mini­van, small signs of the ease with which he strad­dles the worlds of lux­ury and func­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>In his new avatar as chair­man and man­ag­ing part­ner of the US$500 mil­lion (S$674 mil­lion) GCC Asia Growth Fund, and chair­man and CEO, As­pi­ra­tional Con­sumer Life­style Corp, US, a blank cheque com­pany that raised US$250 mil­lion in its Septem­ber share sale, Mr Thakran is fully fo­cused on in­vest­ments. Those who put money in the funds are count­ing on his in­dus­try knowl­edge and track record in Asia, par­tic­u­larly China, to de­liver for them.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, he in­tends to launch a sec­ond pri­vate eq­uity fund called Asia 3.0 with a tar­geted war chest of US$1 bil­lion to US$1.5 bil­lion. It will fo­cus on ma­ture com­pa­nies in Ja­pan, China, South-east Asia and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Mr Thakran’s route to East Asia started in Lon­don, where he was posted in the early 1990s by In­dia’s Tata Group to sell its Ti­tan range of watches.</p>
    <p>A tense en­counter at a watch show with the late Mr Ni­co­las Hayek, leg­endary chair­man of Swatch Group, de­vel­oped into a warmer re­la­tion­ship and a job of­fer. Soon, he was in Sin­ga­pore to head Asia op­er­a­tions for Swatch, sell­ing brands such as Omega, Rado and Longines. His first trip to China was in 1992.</p>
    <p>“Al­ready, it was ev­i­dent then China was the next big thing,” says Mr Thakran. “These brands be­came the most dom­i­nant brands in the in­dus­try, and Asia be­came the largest part (of the busi­ness). I was ap­pointed to the Swatch board in 1996, the youngest mem­ber and the first Asian. I was 33 years old, al­lowed to travel first class and given a stock gift.”</p>
    <p>At the time, sto­ried LVMH was mak­ing a move into watches and jew­ellery and, against his in­stincts, he agreed to meet them. It led to a job and a China post­ing, even en­rolling at Pek­ing Univer­sity to learn Chi­nese where, he says, he picked up enough of the lan­guage to even give me­dia in­ter­views in it.</p>
    <p>Al­though his Swatch ex­pe­ri­ence had pre­pared him some­what for the job, it was nev­er­the­less a chal­lenge work­ing with French­men who were su­per con­fi­dent they knew the last word in lux­ury.</p>
    <p>Early on, he told LVMH Group chair­man Bernard Ar­nault and CEO of watch and jew­ellery Philippe Pascal that it would not work with him as Asia head that all the busi­ness man­agers were French, and based in Hong Kong. If you don’t live in China, smell the air and walk the streets, you won’t win there, was his ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been given the go-ahead to change, push­back be­gan as soon as he started im­ple­ment­ing. On the day he an­nounced Mr Ricky Law would take over from a Euro­pean man­ager to head watch and jew­ellery for Hong Kong and Ma­cau, one of the man­agers be­ing re­placed told him he was mak­ing the mis­take of his life.</p>
    <p>“Ricky went on to break ev­ery record,” says Mr Thakran. “He was phe­nom­e­nal. We had China run by Chi­nese, Hong Kong by a Hong Konger, Sin­ga­pore by a Sin­ga­porean, In­dian in In­dia. To­day, the bulk of the lead­er­ship is a great mix.”</p>
    <p>He also hugely cred­its his col­league Mark Bed­ing­ham, who rose to be LVMH’s Asia-Pa­cific re­gional man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and has now joined him as vice-chair­man of As­pi­ra­tional Con­sumer</p>
    <p>Life­style, for the suc­cess of the LVMH spir­its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>China, he notes, was never a cognac-drink­ing na­tion and nei­ther did Ja­panese rel­ish champagne. To­day, China is by far the big­gest cognac mar­ket for the brand, help­ing grow Hen­nessy into a US$1.5 bil­lion brand, ac­cord­ing to some mar­ket es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Some of that came from push­ing ex­pen­sive cognac as the pres­tige drink to be served to Western ven­dors and buy­ers vis­it­ing China. In Ja­pan, where women have a tra­di­tion of af­ter­noon tea with friends, the size of champagne glasses was de­lib­er­ately re­duced as a nod to the mod­esty af­fected by Ja­panese ladies, who then felt more com­fort­able im­bib­ing lib­er­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Thakran came into my radar last year when I no­ticed his pic­ture in the Chongqing of­fices of Mr Vito Xu, founder of the ex­pand­ing Sasseur malls. Anec­do­tal ev­i­dence sug­gests that L Cat­ter­ton, which picked up a large stake in the firm in 2015, made a par­tial, prof­itable exit in 2018, the year Sasseur Reit listed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“L Cat­ter­ton’s in­volve­ment was a def­i­nite fil­lip to the suc­cess of Sasseur Reit’s IPO,” says Sasseur CEO An­thony Ang. Mr Thakran says he and Mr Xu main­tain a warm re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>While he says his best China eq­uity play was in Marubi Beauty, now listed and val­ued at more than US$4 bil­lion, it is his eq­uity play in Charles & Keith founded by the Wong broth­ers that he seems most proud, de­scrib­ing the Sin­ga­pore firm as the “best high-value, low-price fash­ion brand in the world”.</p>
    <p>In­deed, he tells a story of LVMH chair­man Ar­nault at the brand’s Changi Air­port out­let, sur­rounded by the CEOs of top la­bels like Dior and Fendi and ask­ing them to guess the price of a $45 Charles & Keith bag. The low­est cited by the fash­ion big­wigs, he chuck­les, was $225.</p>
    <p>When L Cat­ter­ton in­vested in the firm, it had a pres­ence in five cities – Sin­ga­pore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Bangkok and Dubai.</p>
    <p>“I told the broth­ers you have to go to China,” he says. “The mass of Chi­nese want to buy some­thing that is like branded but at bet­ter price. It is a huge play. You have to flip a coin and one of you needs to move there.”</p>
    <p>Ad­vised by peo­ple like for­mer Sephora CEO Jac­ques Levy, Mr Thakran pushed for stores to keep bags as well, not just shoes, even if they oc­cu­pied more shelf space. Rather than have two stores each in the big cities like Beijing, Shang­hai, Shenyang and Guangzhou, he sug­gested Charles & Keith try mak­ing a big open­ing blast in Shang­hai with dozens of stores, see­ing it is the Chi­nese city that makes the big­gest state­ment.</p>
    <p>“To­day, they have sev­eral hun­dred stores in China and it con­trib­utes a lot of their profit,” he says. “It is their big­gest suc­cess story so much so that some coun­ter­feit­ers make fake Charles & Keith bags. I sin­cerely be­lieve it can be a US$10 bil­lion brand.”</p>
    <p>Mr Thakran says he left L Cat­ter­ton be­cause the Asian part­ners did not have eq­uity on the plate, whereas oth­ers did – “The mo­ment you have two lev­els of cit­i­zen­ship, and you hap­pen to be sec­ond, it cre­ates dis­so­nance. As sim­ple as that.”</p>
    <p>The next stage of his ca­reer is about build­ing brands, es­pe­cially in Asia. He sees many as­sets, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore, fo­cused on hospi­tal­ity, well­ness, beauty, fash­ion, travel and leisure that could be fu­ture tar­gets for his funds. Al­ready, a third of the US$500 mil­lion Asia growth fund has been de­ployed while the 3.0 fund will fo­cus on big­ger deals in Ja­pan, South Korea, China and South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The two funds will op­er­ate in­de­pen­dently. The blank cheque fund will seek out firms in the West look­ing for the con­tex­tual in­tel­li­gence to pen­e­trate en­trenched Asian mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Need­less to say, all this is far from the world of buf­faloes and wheat fields that marked his child­hood. “I still have that thing – maybe, I don’t be­long here,” says Mr Thakran. “I need to kind of overdo it to be­long. But it has been a good driv­ing force for me to keep learn­ing.”</p>
