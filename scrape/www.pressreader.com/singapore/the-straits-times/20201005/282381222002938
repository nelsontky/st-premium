    <p>At the hos­pi­tal, we meet nu­mer­ous pa­tients with var­ied con­di­tions ev­ery day. A few make a last­ing im­pres­sion, which hap­pens only once in a while.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, we cared for Mr S, who touched our hearts, leav­ing us a mem­ory that we will cher­ish for a long time to come. It brought to mind a song from long ago, which opens with the lyrics: “Per­sons are gifts of God to me, that all come wrapped so dif­fer­ently. Some so tightly, oth­ers so loosely, but wrap­pings are not the gifts.”</p>
    <p>Mr S, who was in his 70s, suf­fered from ad­vanced kid­ney dis­ease and started to ex­pe­ri­ence de­clin­ing cog­ni­tive func­tion, in­creas­ing frailty and faint­ing spells sev­eral months ago.</p>
    <p>He was ad­mit­ted for two con­sec­u­tive faint­ing episodes and sub­se­quent eval­u­a­tion showed he likely suf­fered from an atyp­i­cal form of Parkin­son­ism, which had se­verely af­fected the ner­vous sys­tem and con­se­quently led to an in­abil­ity to main­tain a nor­mal blood pres­sure.</p>
    <p>In fact, it was so de­bil­i­tat­ing that he de­vel­oped a pho­bia of sit­ting and stand­ing as he would ex­pe­ri­ence cold sweats and near faint­ing episodes.</p>
    <p>Cou­pled with the com­pli­ca­tions of a con­cur­rent in­fec­tion and nau­sea from the ef­fects of mul­ti­ple med­i­ca­tions, he be­came in­creas­ingly de­spon­dent, of­ten ex­press­ing a de­sire to die.</p>
    <p>As vis­it­ing hours are lim­ited dur­ing pan­demic times, he was mostly alone dur­ing his weeks of so­journ in the ward, where he strug­gled to stay alive and hope­ful.</p>
    <p>Sens­ing his lone­li­ness and sad­ness, we stepped in to fill the empti­ness by hav­ing daily con­ver­sa­tions with him. We learnt that he liked Ribena and went to buy it for him reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>He was a gen­tle soul with a kind dis­po­si­tion which quickly en­deared him to us.</p>
    <p>Mr S shared that he had a close-knit fam­ily with two daugh­ters whom he had raised al­most sin­gle-hand­edly when his wife died in her 30s.</p>
    <p>As with most Asian fa­thers, he was not ac­cus­tomed to ex­press­ing his love with words, but faith­fully pro­vided for his fam­ily through acts of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>One day, his con­di­tion took a nose­dive and it soon be­came clear his days were num­bered. When we broke the news of the prog­no­sis to him, he, to our sur­prise, ex­pressed his de­sire to live on.</p>
    <p>He said he could not bear to part with those dear­est to him, which in­cluded us as well as the other doc­tors, nurses and ther­a­pists who had been car­ing for him.</p>
    <p>He fi­nally left us for eter­nity af­ter five weeks in our midst and we felt a deep sense of loss.</p>
    <p>It is not of­ten that strong emo­tions fill us in an en­vi­ron­ment where death has be­come a norm.</p>
    <p>What les­son does this ex­pe­ri­ence hold?</p>
    <p>When Mr S’ iden­tity and self-worth were pro­gres­sively dec­i­mated by ill­ness, we filled the void by up­hold­ing his per­son­hood through the bonds formed and re­la­tion­ships shared.</p>
    <p>In one of her books, au­thor and ad­vo­cate for peo­ple with de­men­tia Christine Bry­den wrote: “There’s a Zulu say­ing that’s very true, a per­son is a per­son through oth­ers. Give us re­as­sur­ances, hugs and sup­port and a mean­ing in life.”</p>
    <p>So, we went be­yond our pro­fes­sional roles and of­fered our­selves as fel­low com­pan­ions on Mr S’ life jour­ney, in a man­ner which philoso­pher Martin Bu­ber de­scribed as an I-thou re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>In so do­ing, we made his suf­fer­ing more bear­able and he no longer said he wanted to die.</p>
    <p>In fact, when faced with the prospect of an im­pend­ing death, he wanted to live as he had found re­newed mean­ing in the re­la­tion­ships formed.</p>
    <p>To­day, eu­thana­sia is a grow­ing re­al­ity in a so­ci­ety that stresses the rights of the in­di­vid­ual and where the in­stru­men­tal worth of a per­son may be val­ued above his in­trin­sic worth.</p>
    <p>A per­son may then choose to end his life when he deems he has lit­tle to of­fer in util­i­tar­ian terms and suf­fer­ing seems to hold no mean­ing and pur­pose.</p>
    <p>Our ex­pe­ri­ence with Mr S taught us that amid the rav­ages of a dis­ease that threaten one’s iden­tity, one’s sense of self is not all lost as hope and mean­ing can still be found in shared re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>The dig­nity of a per­son can be strength­ened by hu­man con­nec­tions. Per­haps, it is when re­la­tion­ships di­min­ish that the will to live fiz­zles out.</p>
    <p>The song that we know ends with this line: “We’re all per­sons, gifts to be shared, so let’s have a grand ex­change of gifts.”</p>
    <p>We gave all of our­selves in car­ing for Mr S and, from this, he found a rea­son to live by tran­scend­ing the tra­vails of ill­ness. This gift of his to us is a re­minder of the sanc­tity of life, the pri­macy of peo­ple and re­la­tion­ships, and the para­dox that in times of loss we dis­cover a new sense of close­ness that is bit­ter­sweet; the deeper the love, the greater the pain.</p>
    <p>We are grate­ful for the times spent with Mr S and know we are the bet­ter for it.</p>
