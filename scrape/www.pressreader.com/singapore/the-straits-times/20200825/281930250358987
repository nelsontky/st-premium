    <p>WASHINGTON • White House coun­sel­lor Kellyanne Con­way, one of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s longest­serv­ing aides, is leav­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tion at the end of the month, she said in a state­ment, cit­ing fam­ily con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mrs Con­way, the first woman to man­age a win­ning pres­i­den­tial cam­paign, said in a state­ment that she is leav­ing to fo­cus on her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band Ge­orge Con­way said on Twit­ter that he is leav­ing the Lin­coln Project, a po­lit­i­cal group com­mit­ted to de­feat­ing Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“We dis­agree about plenty but we are united on what mat­ters most: the kids,” Mrs Con­way said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our four chil­dren are teens and tweens start­ing a new aca­demic year, in mid­dle school and high school, re­motely from home for at least a few months,” she said.</p>
    <p>“As mil­lions of par­ents na­tion­wide know, kids ‘do­ing school from home’ re­quire a level of at­ten­tion and vig­i­lance that is as un­usual as th­ese times.”</p>
    <p>She said the de­ci­sion to leave was hers, and a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said she in­formed Mr Trump on Sun­day evening.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, the Con­ways’ high-school-age daugh­ter Clau­dia posted a se­ries of tweets in which she said she was “dev­as­tated” that her mother is speak­ing at the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion and sug­gested strife with both her par­ents.</p>
    <p>She and her fa­ther both later tweeted that they were tak­ing breaks from so­cial me­dia. Mrs Con­way made no men­tion of her daugh­ter’s tweets. “In time, I will an­nounce fu­ture plans,” she said. “For now, and for my beloved chil­dren, it will be less drama, more mama.”</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can con­ven­tion kicked off yes­ter­day with Mr Trump’s renom­i­na­tion for pres­i­dent by del­e­gates gath­ered in Char­lotte, North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Mrs Con­way is still ex­pected to speak at the con­ven­tion to­mor­row, ac­cord­ing to a source.</p>
