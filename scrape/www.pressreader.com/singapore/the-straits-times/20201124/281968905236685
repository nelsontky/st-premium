    <p>I read with dis­ap­point­ment the Na­tional Parks Board’s ad­vi­sories per­tain­ing to Covid-19 (Phase 2) on its web­site, in par­tic­u­lar, that camp­ing sites, in­clud­ing those on Pu­lau Ubin, and bar­be­cue pits re­main closed.</p>
    <p>As an avid camper, I have been wait­ing to be al­lowed to go camp­ing again. In the early phases of the pan­demic, it was easy to un­der­stand and ac­cept the re­stric­tion on all pub­lic ac­tiv­i­ties so as to re­duce the trans­mis­sion of the dis­ease, even though camp­ing in it­self is a low-risk ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Now that we are in late phase two, and with other pub­lic ac­tiv­i­ties al­lowed to pro­ceed with mit­i­gat­ing mea­sures, I am sad­dened that camp­ing is still left out.</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand the con­cern that camp­ing can in­volve large num­bers of un­re­lated people in prox­im­ity for long pe­ri­ods such as in school-or­gan­ised ex­tracur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties. How­ever, like ev­ery other ac­tiv­ity be­ing al­lowed now, it can be reg­u­lated through re­stric­tion of num­bers or du­ra­tion in­stead of a dra­co­nian blan­ket ban.</p>
    <p>I camp alone over a sin­gle night in a sin­gle-per­son tent. It is hard to ac­cept that camp­ing car­ries a higher risk of con­tract­ing or trans­mit­ting Covid-19 than, for ex­am­ple, at­tend­ing a re­li­gious ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Camp­ing in Sin­ga­pore al­ready has an ex­ist­ing reg­u­la­tory sys­tem. There are only three per­mit­ted sites. Two of the sites re­quire on­line reg­is­tra­tion and limit the reg­is­trant to two days per month.</p>
    <p>I have been vis­ited each time I camped by a friendly po­lice of­fi­cer to check my iden­ti­fi­ca­tion and my camp­ing reg­is­tra­tion. I hope it will not be too hard to build on this sys­tem to en­sure the max­i­mum num­ber of al­lowed campers and max­i­mum days per­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>I have al­ready ap­proached NParks di­rectly via the stan­dard chan­nels with­out ob­tain­ing sat­is­fac­tory clo­sure. Per­haps it is be­cause Sin­ga­pore does not have a strong out­doors cul­ture or com­mu­nity that there is no im­pe­tus to open up the camp­sites. The pub­lic camp­sites in Sin­ga­pore are com­mu­nity re­sources. I hope NParks, as the cus­to­dian, will look into open­ing them up to pub­lic use again ex­pe­di­ently.</p>
