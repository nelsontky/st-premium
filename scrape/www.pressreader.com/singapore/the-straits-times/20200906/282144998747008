    <p>MONZA (Italy) • Lewis Hamil­ton’s party piece has been mak­ing records dis­ap­pear and he was at it again yes­ter­day, smash­ing the Monza track record to take pole po­si­tion for the Ital­ian Grand Prix with the fastest lap in For­mula One his­tory.</p>
    <p>The Mercedes driver pro­duced a sen­sa­tional lap of 1min 18.887sec – at an av­er­age speed of 264.362kmh – on a sunny af­ter­noon to lead Fin­nish team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas in another front-row lock­out.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t too bad,” said the six­time world cham­pion with a hint of a smile.</p>
    <p>“It was a fan­tas­tic per­for­mance from the team – in terms of tim­ing, when they put us out on the track,” added the Bri­ton, re­fer­ring to Mercedes’ avoid­ance of the j ostling mass of cars seek­ing a slip­stream­ing tow from each other.</p>
    <p>“It was not the eas­i­est as you saw how close it is be­tween us all, so it de­manded a re­ally clean lap – and I felt I got that, so I am very happy.”</p>
    <p>It was a record-ex­tend­ing 94th pole of his stel­lar ca­reer, and his sev­enth at Monza, and shat­tered the idea that a clampdown on so-called en­gine “party modes” would af­fect his team’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“No party. No prob­lem,” said the team on their of­fi­cial Twit­ter feed.</p>
    <p>McLaren’s Car­los Sainz qual­i­fied third, with Rac­ing Point’s Ser­gio</p>
    <p>An over­joyed Mercedes ace Lewis Hamil­ton with his team mem­bers af­ter qual­i­fy­ing in pole po­si­tion for the Ital­ian Grand Prix in Monza.</p>
    <p>Perez fourth. Hamil­ton’s clos­est cham­pi­onship ri­val Max Ver­stap­pen, 47 points be­hind af­ter seven races, was fifth for Red Bull.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari’s Charles Le­clerc and Se­bas­tian Vet­tel will line up a hu­mil­i­at­ing 13th and 17th re­spec­tively for their team’s home race – the first time since 1984 that Fer­rari failed to qual­ify in the top 10 with ei­ther car at Monza.</p>
    <p>“The best I can do,” said Le­clerc over the team ra­dio of his ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Another win for Hamil­ton today would be his sixth in eight races and ca­reer 90th – one short of for­mer Fer­rari great Michael Schu­macher’s all-time record.</p>
    <p>Mercedes are on course to win both cham­pi­onships again this sea­son for the sev­enth year in a row.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the team’s pub­lished 2019 ac­counts, they spent £333 mil­lion (S$603.5 mil­lion) but still re­ported a profit.</p>
    <p>The re­sults to end-De­cem­ber showed Mercedes made an af­ter­tax gain of £14.7 mil­lion, up nearly 17 per cent from £12.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Turnover was £363.6 mil­lion, up 7.4 per cent from a pre­vi­ous £338.4 mil­lion, due mainly to in­creased spon­sor­ship and mar­ket­ing rev­enue.</p>
