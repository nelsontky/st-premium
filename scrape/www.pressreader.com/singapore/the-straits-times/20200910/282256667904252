    <p>The Sin­ga­pore bourse was on shaky ground with the key Straits Times In­dex trad­ing underwater all of yes­ter­day and par­ing some losses to fin­ish 5.43 points, or 0.22 per cent, lower at 2,499.33, fol­low­ing an ex­tended tech sell-off on Wall Street overnight.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing a dou­ble whammy was news that vac­cine front run­ner As­traZeneca had paused clin­i­cal tri­als af­ter a par­tic­i­pant fell ill, dash­ing hopes of a Covid-19 vac­cine that has been a big fac­tor in the mar­kets’ re­cent rally.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing vol­ume on the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket to­talled 1.46 bil­lion shares worth $1.21 bil­lion, higher than Tues­day’s 1.3 bil­lion shares worth $943 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Key Asian gauges across the board, from Ja­pan, Hong Kong and China, to Tai­wan, South Korea and Malaysia, posted losses, clos­ing lower by be­tween 0.4 per cent and 1.9 per cent. Aus­tralia was the hard­est hit, fall­ing 2.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Nas­daq has lost 10 per cent over three straight ses­sions, and is spear­head­ing a broad risk re­duc­tion across as­sets, in­clud­ing oil and gold, re­marked Mr Stephen Innes of Ax­i­Corp. Nev­er­the­less, he pointed out that the tech-heavy in­dex still re­mains at its lofti­est at cur­rent lev­els, at 60 per cent higher than March’s lows.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts reckon that tech stocks are in the mid­dle of a tech­ni­cal cor­rec­tion as fun­da­men­tally, there are no sig­nif­i­cant ma­te­rial changes that can be pin­pointed for the rout.</p>
    <p>The big ques­tion mark is the ex­tent to which other as­set classes such as bonds, pre­cious me­tals and cur­ren­cies will be hurt by this cor­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Innes fur­ther cau­tioned: “Although the eq­ui­ties’ weak­ness and, in par­tic­u­lar, the tech sec­tor, is mak­ing many head­lines, do not un­der­es­ti­mate the Brexit im­pact. Judg­ing by the way Bri­tish pound as­sets are trad­ing on Tues­day, in­vestors were far too com­pla­cent to the ‘no-deal’ tail risk.”</p>
    <p>On the home front, Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion gained 18.7 per cent to close at 17.8 cents, fol­low­ing its trad­ing re­sump­tion at 4pm. In fil­ings, it an­nounced that sub­stan­tial share­holder Oei Hong Leong – the Sin­ga­pore ty­coon who has been try­ing to re­move the com­pany’s founder Chew Hua Seng as chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive – ac­quired two mil­lion shares for nearly $285,000 on Tues­day, rais­ing his to­tal hold­ings from 12.9 per cent to 13.05 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp Marine topped the day’s most ac­tively traded list with about 209 mil­lion shares worth $38 mil­lion chang­ing hands. The stock fell 1.6 per cent to 19 cents.</p>
