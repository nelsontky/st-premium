    <p>LIS­BON • Paris Saint-Ger­main have once again been hit by a flood of in­juries go­ing into a crunch Cham­pi­ons League knock­out tie, but this time Ney­mar is fit and seem­ingly ready to live up to his sta­tus as the world’s most ex­pen­sive player.</p>
    <p>The French cham­pi­ons face Ital­ian side Ata­lanta in Lis­bon to­day in the first quar­ter-fi­nal of the “Fi­nal Eight”, af­ter Uefa turned the lat­ter stages of this year’s com­pe­ti­tion into a knock­out for­mat be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Not only will there will be no fans at the Es­ta­dio da Luz, but PSG are also short on match fit­ness com­pared to their Serie A op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Thomas Tuchel’s players have played only two com­pet­i­tive fix­tures since March af­ter the French league season was first halted be­fore be­ing pre­ma­turely can­celled ow­ing to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Given the long stop­page, PSG were not at their best in those two games, but they did enough to win two fur­ther tro­phies – the French Cup and French League Cup – for their fourth do­mes­tic tre­ble in six sea­sons.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is one piece of sil­ver­ware that is miss­ing from their tro­phy cabi­net since the Qatari takeover in 2011 – the Cham­pi­ons League. It is the rea­son why PSG spent a world record €222 mil­lion (S$359 mil­lion) to l ure Ney­mar from Barcelona in the sum­mer of 2017.</p>
    <p>The club’s con­tin­ued fail­ure to lift a maiden Euro­pean Cup is also the rea­son Tuchel is their fourth coach since the buy­out.</p>
    <p>Ney­mar has also not fully lived up to his price tag, suf­fer­ing a string of in­juries that forced him to miss crit­i­cal Euro­pean games. First, there was the bro­ken metatarsal that ruled him out of the last-16, sec­ond­leg tie against Real Madrid in 2018 as PSG were knocked out by the reign­ing cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>His­tory re­peated it­self a year later, as an­other metatarsal in­jury forced him to miss the de­feat at the same stage, when they threw away a 2-0 first-leg ad­van­tage to a medi­ocre Manch­ester United side.</p>
    <p>Since then, there has been plenty of spec­u­la­tion over a pos­si­ble re­turn to Barcelona for Ney­mar, but the 28-year-old fi­nally seems set­tled and is in fine shape to lead his team against Ata­lanta as they look to progress to the last four for the first time since 1995.</p>
    <p>The Brazil for­ward is gun­ning for an un­prece­dented quadru­ple, telling the club’s web­site: “I’m hav­ing my best time since I came to Paris. I’ve lived through happy mo­ments and dif­fi­cult ones, es­pe­cially when the in­juries didn’t al­low me to play.</p>
    <p>“With the help of my team­mates, I was able to over­come them and fo­cus on what really mat­ters, our per­for­mances on the field which trans­late into ti­tles.”</p>
    <p>PSG will be count­ing on him as Tuchel has all sorts of se­lec­tion con­cerns else­where. His other star for­ward, Kylian Mbappe, is ex­pected to be on the bench at best as he tries to shake off an an­kle in­jury.</p>
    <p>An­gel di Maria is banned, while Marco Ver­ratti, Layvin Kurzawa and Thilo Kehrer are all in­jured and Edin­son Ca­vani has left on a free trans­fer. To top it all, Tuchel is on crutches too as the Ger­man coach broke his metatarsal last week.</p>
    <p>But as long as Ney­mar is fit, PSG should be too strong for debu­tants Ata­lanta, who also have their own prob­lems to con­tend with. Top scorer Josip Ilicic, who has net­ted 21 times in all com­pe­ti­tions, will be miss­ing due to per­sonal is­sues.</p>
    <p>“We’re a very strong team to­gether, we’ve won four ti­tles (in­clud­ing the French cur­tain-raiser) al­ready this season, and I’m very happy to be the PSG man­ager,” Tuchel said. “It’s a gift for me.”</p>
