    <p>Through­out the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore has re­lied on a se­ries of strin­gent mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude a near com­plete lockdown – termed the “cir­cuit breaker” – as well as travel re­stric­tions, quar­an­tine mea­sures, man­dates on mask wear­ing, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and ex­ten­sive con­tract trac­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of th­ese mea­sures is a low rate of in­fec­tion. But this has come at a sig­nif­i­cant cost.</p>
    <p>Not only is Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct down 12 per cent com­pared with one year ago, but there are other non-quan­tifi­able costs, in­clud­ing higher rates of anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>As the virus is show­ing no signs of abat­ing, the one hope is a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine.</p>
    <p>There are 154 Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates in pre-clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tion, 44 in clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tion and a few in late-stage devel­op­ment, in­clud­ing one be­ing de­vel­oped through a part­ner­ship be­tween Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics and Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School. Thus, it is pos­si­ble that a vac­cine may be avail­able early next year.</p>
    <p>We trust that reg­u­la­tors will not ap­prove any drug they do not feel is safe and ef­fec­tive, but the re­al­ity is that there will not be ev­i­dence on long-term safety and ef­fi­cacy upon ap­proval. As a re­sult, many in­di­vid­u­als may opt to wait un­til longer-term data is avail­able be­fore get­ting vac­ci­nated or de­cide against any vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Ev­i­dence sug­gests that for herd im­mu­nity – the thresh­old at which the virus can no longer repli­cate in the pop­u­la­tion – to oc­cur, roughly 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion would need to be im­mune, ei­ther through vac­ci­na­tion or through prior ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>Given the low ex­po­sure rate in Sin­ga­pore, hav­ing a vac­ci­na­tion level be­low 70 per cent may not be suc­cess­ful in stop­ping the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Yet, a re­cent in­ter­na­tional Ip­sos poll that did not in­clude Sin­ga­pore re­vealed that the rate of re­fus­ing to be vac­ci­nated when a vac­cine first be­comes avail­able is pre­dicted to far ex­ceed 30 per cent in many coun­tries. Many are hes­i­tant to vac­ci­nate due to safety con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Up­take rate de­pends on many fac­tors, not least is the price of the vac­cine, which is ex­pected to be highly sub­sidised, if not free, when first avail­able.</p>
    <p>To pro­vide ev­i­dence of up­take rates for Sin­ga­pore, we added ques­tions to a lo­cal on­line panel sur­vey fielded to 515 par­tic­i­pants be­tween Sept 11 and 24. We asked the par­tic­i­pants about per­cep­tions of their risk of get­ting Covid-19 and whether or not they would get vac­ci­nated if a vac­cine that the Gov­ern­ment be­lieved was safe and ef­fec­tive be­came avail­able.</p>
    <p>The find­ings showed that, de­spite the low rates of in­fec­tion and death in Sin­ga­pore, most re­spon­dents still felt that their risk of get­ting Covid-19 was high and that, if in­fected, their out­comes were likely to in­clude hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and, po­ten­tially, death.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, half of the re­spon­dents be­lieved that they had at least a one-in-four chance of get­ting Covid-19, and more than a third be­lieved that their risk of dy­ing from Covid-19 was 2.5 per cent or more, which is five times the Covid-19 death rate in Sin­ga­pore to date.</p>
    <p>One might ex­pect that th­ese per­ceived high death and in­fec­tion rates should spur a high de­mand for a vac­cine that the Gov­ern­ment deems safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>In the sur­vey, a hy­po­thet­i­cal vac­cine was of­fered to par­tic­i­pants: They had the op­tion to get a fully sub­sidised (free) vac­cine im­me­di­ately, or wait two months and pay a mar­ket price that was ran­domly var­ied to test price sen­si­tiv­ity, or never be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that at a mar­ket price of $100, 42 per cent stated that they would choose to be vac­ci­nated for free im­me­di­ately, 35 per cent would choose to pay the $100 and be vac­ci­nated af­ter two or more months as­sum­ing the vac­cine re­mained safe and worked as ex­pected, and 22 per cent stated that they would never get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>When mar­ket prices were stated to be in thou­sands of dol­lars af­ter two months of free ac­cess, some of those who orig­i­nally said they would wait would now take their chances and be vac­ci­nated im­me­di­ately, whereas those who were more risk-averse went to the other ex­treme and would not be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>At the high­est sub­se­quent price of $6,000, 52 per cent of re­spon­dents opted for the im­me­di­ately avail­able free vac­cine. Among those with young chil­dren, more than two-thirds would def­i­nitely or prob­a­bly vac­ci­nate their chil­dren if the vac­cine were of­fered free of charge. Still oth­ers chose to wait and see.</p>
    <p>In all sce­nar­ios con­sid­ered,</p>
    <p>22 per cent or more stated that they would never be vac­ci­nated. Th­ese re­sults sug­gest that achiev­ing a 70 per cent vac­cine up­take rate ap­pears un­likely with­out a man­date.</p>
    <p>For pol­i­cy­mak­ers, the re­sults re­veal that just hav­ing a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine avail­able is not enough for a re­turn to nor­mal life.</p>
    <p>Short of a man­date, get­ting in­di­vid­u­als to be vac­ci­nated at high enough lev­els to gen­er­ate herd im­mu­nity is go­ing to be a ma­jor chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing the vac­cine free will help, but the sur­vey re­sults sug­gest that keep­ing it that way in­def­i­nitely may not be the best strat­egy, as many will choose to wait and see how well the vac­cine works.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing it free for a given in­ter­val and then let­ting prices rise af­ter a win­dow pe­riod is likely to gen­er­ate greater up­take in the short term, and should be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>Even then, more will need to be done. Up­take could be in­creased by public health mes­sag­ing cam­paigns re­mind­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans that although vac­ci­na­tion is an in­di­vid­ual choice, vac­ci­na­tion ben­e­fits all of us due to herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Com­bat­ing Covid-19 – by heed­ing mea­sures such as keep­ing a safe dis­tance from oth­ers and wear­ing masks – is truly a com­mu­nity ef­fort.</p>
    <p>So is get­ting as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble to say yes to vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
