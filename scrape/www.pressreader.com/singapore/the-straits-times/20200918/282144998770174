    <p>Amer­i­can ven­ture cap­i­tal (VC) firm Light­speed Ven­ture Part­ners is bas­ing its South-east Asia op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore, the com­pany said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Light­speed part­ner Ak­shay Bhushan told The Straits Times that this will al­low the firm to cap­ture growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion and sup­port bud­ding en­ter­prises here.</p>
    <p>While Light­speed op­er­ates in Sin­ga­pore with a tight team of five, four of whom are in­vest­ment pro­fes­sion­als, the firm will eval­u­ate its man­power needs as its in­vest­ments in the re­gion in­crease over the next few years.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to set up its South-east Asia head­quar­ters amid the coron­avirus pan­demic is partly due to the cri­sis, Mr Bhushan said.</p>
    <p>“(We’ve seen) in the re­gion a very strong up­take of dig­i­tal ser­vices and ac­cel­er­ated in­no­va­tion and, in some ways, it’s forced in­no­va­tion, both from con­sumers as well as busi­nesses... It only makes our in­vest­ment in the re­gion even more timely.”</p>
    <p>Light­speed’s in­vest­ments in the re­gion in­clude Sin­ga­pore-head­quar­tered “su­per app” Grab and Jakarta-based so­cial com­merce plat­form Chili­beli.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of its other ven­tures – such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence so­lu­tions firm Yel­low Mes­sen­ger and hos­pi­tal­ity chain OYO Rooms – are also scal­ing up their busi­ness in Asean and have their re­gional head­quar­ters in Sin­ga­pore, the firm noted.</p>
    <p>Its ex­pan­sion in Sin­ga­pore is fur­ther af­fir­ma­tion of the coun­try’s po­si­tion as a start-up hub in the re­gion, be­ing home to some 3,800 start-ups and pro­vid­ing ac­cess to many other fast-grow­ing com­pa­nies in Asia.</p>
    <p>Around 92 VC com­pa­nies and ac­tive in­vestors are lo­cated in Sin­ga­pore and in­vest in firms across var­i­ous growth stages.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Ac­tion Com­mu­nity for En­trepreneur­ship, the na­tional body for Sin­ga­pore’s start-up ecosys­tem, said the new VC firms bring with them new per­spec­tives and net­works.</p>
    <p>Ex­ten­sive net­works both within and out­side Sin­ga­pore are one of the rea­sons for the Re­pub­lic’s sta­tus as a tech hub, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that VCs lo­cate them­selves in Sin­ga­pore know­ing the flow of deals comes not just from the Re­pub­lic but also through­out the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“VCs also know that in an in­dus­try where there is more col­lab­o­ra­tion than com­pe­ti­tion, deals are of­ten worked on to­gether by mul­ti­ple in­vestors and there­fore be­ing in Sin­ga­pore fa­cil­i­tates deal-mak­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Both pri­vate eq­uity and VC ac­tiv­ity slowed in South-east Asia in the first quar­ter of this year, with a to­tal of 141 deals worth US$1.4 bil­lion (S$1.9 bil­lion) an­nounced, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm EY.</p>
    <p>This was a 65 per cent plunge in ag­gre­gated value of deals com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
