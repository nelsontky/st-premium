    <p>Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents will be able to col­lect the Na­tional Day Pa­rade 2020 packs at com­mu­nity cen­tres or clubs (CCs) and res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee (RC) cen­tres from to­day, the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA) said last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>As part of this year’s con­cept to bring the Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) into homes amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the NDP2020 ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee will be giv­ing a Sin­ga­pore To­gether Pack to ev­ery Sin­ga­porean and per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) house­hold. Each house­hold can col­lect one pack.</p>
    <p>The packs can be col­lected at all CCs from to­day to Aug 2. They are also avail­able at all RC cen­tres from to­day to July 26.</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tion times are from 10am to 6pm, ex­clud­ing pub­lic hol­i­days. Res­i­dents must present their NRIC at the col­lec­tion counter for ver­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The PA ad­vised that only one mem­ber from each house­hold should col­lect the pack to avoid crowd­ing at the col­lec­tion points.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and tem­per­a­ture tak­ing will also be im­ple­mented at the col­lec­tion cen­tres to en­sure the safety and well-be­ing of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>It added: “In line with t he NDP2020 t heme ‘To­gether, A Stronger Sin­ga­pore’, the Sin­ga­pore To­gether Pack demon­strates our sol­i­dar­ity as a united, in­clu­sive and re­silient na­tion amidst Covid-19, and presents Sin­ga­pore­ans with a phys­i­cal con­nec­tion to the NDP ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>The pack will in­clude items such as hand sani­tiser, a ther­mome­ter and face masks, be­sides snacks and canned drinks. Res­i­dents can go to sg­to­geth­er­pack.gowhere.gov.sg to find the near­est cen­tres to col­lect their packs.</p>
    <p>This year’s packs fea­ture 10 de­signs on the bags by as­pir­ing artists with dis­abil­i­ties from seven or­gan­i­sa­tions, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with SG En­able, as well as 10 de­signs by Pri­mary 5 pupils, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob met some of these artists at the En­abling Vil­lage near Red­hill last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>She said: “De­spite Covid-19, I am glad that artists with dis­abil­i­ties and P5 stu­dents have a plat­form to show­case their tal­ents and as­pi­ra­tions at this year’s pa­rade.</p>
    <p>“They are all ex­tremely happy that through their art­works, they are able to share their love and wishes for our na­tion with all fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>She added that in­volv­ing artists with dis­abil­i­ties in this year’s NDP is in line with the fo­cus of the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge 2020 on em­pow­er­ing per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>She said: “I call upon Sin­ga­pore­ans to con­tinue sup­port­ing per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties through (the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge).</p>
    <p>“Through our col­lec­tive ef­fort, we can build a more car­ing and in­clu­sive Sin­ga­pore that em­braces dif­fer­ent abil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>The pack also comes with a printed QR code that leads to in­for­ma­tion on how Sin­ga­pore­ans can con­trib­ute to the so­cial ser­vice agen­cies of the artists with dis­abil­i­ties, as well as an on­line col­lec­tion of sto­ries on the in­spi­ra­tion be­hind each of the de­signs.</p>
    <p>As part of her visit, Madam Hal­imah also penned her as­pi­ra­tions for Sin­ga­pore on an “Our Heart for Sin­ga­pore” card, which is found in ev­ery pack.</p>
    <p>The cards en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to share their reflection­s and grat­i­tude, and to pledge them­selves to wor­thy causes.</p>
    <p>The cards come in 55 de­signs done by var­i­ous artists with dis­abil­i­ties and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>The PA also en­cour­aged house­holds to dis­play the state flag out­side their homes in the lead-up to Na­tional Day. Those who need a flag may ask for one at the col­lec­tion cen­tres.</p>

The 11-year-old ded&#xAD;i&#xAD;cated her draw&#xAD;ing to the for&#xAD;eign work&#xAD;ers here. De&#xAD;scrib&#xAD;ing her art&#xAD;work, which fea&#xAD;tures a &#x201C;strong&#x201D; heart, she said: &#x201C;The strength rep&#xAD;re&#xAD;sents how our na&#xAD;tion is strong and the heart rep&#xAD;re&#xAD;sents our love for our na&#xAD;tion. We are stronger when we are united.&#x201D;</p>
