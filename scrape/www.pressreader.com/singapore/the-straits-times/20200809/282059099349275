    <p>The dis­so­lu­tion of Sabah’s state assem­bly on July 30 to make way for a snap elec­tion, fol­low­ing a threat of mass de­fec­tions by law­mak­ers, has cast the spot­light again on the cul­ture of po­lit­i­cal party-hop­ping in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Since t he turn of t he year, Malaysia has seen its fed­eral gov­ern­ment and four state gov­ern­ments change hands out­side of an elec­tion due to the “frog­ging over” of MPs and state law­mak­ers to the other camp.</p>
    <p>Sabah was close to be­com­ing the fifth state to change hands, with former chief min­is­ter Musa Aman se­cur­ing at least 13 de­fec­tions to form a new gov­ern­ment with a sim­ple ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>But State Gover­nor Juhar Mahirud­din con­sented to in­cum­bent Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal’s pro­posal for a dis­so­lu­tion of the assem­bly.</p>
    <p>This made Sabah the first state in Malaysia to go for fresh polls in­stead of al­low­ing a mid-term change of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>A web­site called Katak Sabah (Frogs of Sabah), which lists out all the state as­sem­bly­men who had de­fected to Tan Sri Musa’s camp in the thwarted takeover at­tempt, has gained trac­tion online.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Sabah has a long his­tory of party de­fec­tions, be­yond the 13 who crossed over to Mr Musa’s camp.</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences of party-hop­ping were first felt in Malaysia’s east­ern­most state in 1994 when Parti Ber­satu Sabah (PBS) won the state assem­bly polls with 25 seats against 23 won by the in­cum­bent coali­tion.</p>
    <p>But de­fec­tions fol­lowed, forc­ing new Chief Min­is­ter Joseph Pairin Kitin­gan to re­sign af­ter less than a month.</p>
    <p>Barisan Na­sional man­aged to en­tice 20 PBS law­mak­ers to jump, leav­ing Tan Sri Pairin with just five seats.</p>
    <p>The epit­ome of the party-hop­ping cul­ture prob­a­bly rests with Mr Pairin’s younger brother, Datuk Dr Jef­frey Kitin­gan.</p>
    <p>The younger Kitin­gan has jumped through seven po­lit­i­cal par­ties in his three decades in pol­i­tics. He was one of the de­fec­tors who caused the col­lapse of his brother’s ad­min­is­tra­tion in 1994.</p>
    <p>Dr Kitin­gan now leads a Sabah­based party called Star, with two seats in the state assem­bly.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians whose party or al­liance won power us­ing “frogs” of­ten cite Ar­ti­cle 10 of the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion, which guar­an­tees “free­dom of as­so­ci­a­tion”, as their de­fence for not be­ing keen to en­act anti-hop­ping laws.</p>
    <p>Only Pe­nang, among Malaysia’s 13 states, has an anti-hop­ping law that man­dates a fresh elec­tion for a con­stituency whose state law­maker has switched sides.</p>
    <p>The state cur­rently plans to de­clare three de­fec­tors’ seats as va­cant, but the Supreme Court had pre­vi­ously ruled that Ke­lan­tan’s at­tempt at en­forc­ing an anti-hop­ping law back in the 1990s was in­valid and against the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>While politi­cians ve­he­mently deny they jumped ship due to prom­ises of cash or a key post in the planned new gov­ern­ment, ob­servers tell a dif­fer­ent story.</p>
    <p>There is also a third rea­son to en­tice them to hop: align­ing the in­com­ing state gov­ern­ment with which­ever al­liance is in power in Pu­tra­jaya. This align­ment of in­ter­ests usu­ally means the fed­eral gov­ern­ment will award more lo­cal “devel­op­ment projects” to ben­e­fit vot­ers and the said law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>“In Sabah, money plays a big role, but nor­mally the rea­son peo­ple hop is that they want to be in gov­ern­ment, so nor­mally the de­fec­tion is to the party in power (at fed­eral level),” said Pro­fes­sor James Chin, di­rec­tor of the Asia In­sti­tute at the Uni­ver­sity of Tas­ma­nia.</p>
    <p>Over in Penin­su­lar Malaysia, four states saw a change in gov­ern­ment in the last five months fol­low­ing the col­lapse of the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Suf­fi­cient num­bers of PH as­sem­bly­men in Jo­hor, Me­laka, Perak and Kedah de­fected to align their state gov­ern­ments with the Perikatan Na­sional fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>And in Malaysia, al­most no politi­cian can say with a straight face that he or she does not con­done MPs or state as­sem­bly­men cross­ing over, es­pe­cially when their side gains.</p>
    <p>Former pre­mier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, who called for the re­jec­tion of the re­cent group of de­fec­tors in Sabah, had him­self openly wel­comed Umno MPs into Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia when he was its chair­man.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu won 13 par­lia­men­tary seats in the 2018 elec­tions, but the num­ber of its MPs has more than dou­bled due to the Umno de­fec­tions. Ber­satu now has 32 MPs.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers in the four-party PH coali­tion qui­etly ac­cepted crossovers in 2018 that al­lowed PH to win con­trol in the state leg­is­la­tures of Kedah, Perak and Sabah.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts be­lieve that in­stead of en­act­ing anti-hop­ping laws, what needs to change is Malaysia’s po­lit­i­cal cul­ture and “money pol­i­tics”.</p>
    <p>Dr Oh Ei Sun, a se­nior fel­low with the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs, said money pol­i­tics is be­hind most party-hop­ping.</p>
    <p>“Money pol­i­tics is the most prom­i­nent rea­son. Peo­ple choose to hop be­cause they are bought by the other side by means of cash, projects, of­fers of min­is­ter­ship or gov­ern­ment-linked com­pany po­si­tion. That is very clear,” Dr Oh told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“There are also other rea­sons. Some­times you see a party power strug­gle and the los­ing side, not want­ing to be per­se­cuted, joins an­other party. Some­times it won’t be across the di­vide; it will be one BN party to an­other, one Pakatan party to an­other,” he added.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Chin: “I think it is very dif­fi­cult to make an ar­gu­ment about anti-hop­ping laws. I think what you need is change in po­lit­i­cal cul­ture – the fact that peo­ple feel they don’t have to re­sign when they leave the party they were in when elected.”</p>
