    <p>Crossovers may be pop­u­lar, but sedans are still the main­stay of the car pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore. The Straits Times pits two sedans, the Toy­ota Corolla Altis (be­low, left) and the Skoda Oc­tavia, each priced at around $110,000, against each other.</p>
    <p>Crossovers may be pop­u­lar, but sedans are still the main­stay of the car pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times pits t wo sedans, each priced at around $110,000, against each other.</p>
    <p>The Toy­ota Corolla Altis and its pre­de­ces­sors have been a ubiq­ui­tous sight here for decades, while the Skoda Oc­tavia is an up­start that re­turned to the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket just two years ago.</p>
    <p>THE CARS</p>
    <p>The Toy­ota Corolla is the world’s best-sell­ing car.</p>
    <p>Launched in 1966, the cur­rent 12th-gen­er­a­tion model went on sale here in Jan­uary af­ter it was un­veiled at the Sin­ga­pore Mo­tor­show.</p>
    <p>The Altis sets the bench­mark for mid-sized sedans.</p>
    <p>Czech car­maker Skoda’s Oc­tavia sedan has been around since 1996, but is a rare sight here be­cause of Skoda’s on-off pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent third-gen­er­a­tion model was launched here in 2018 with a 1-litre en­gine when the brand re­turned to Sin­ga­pore, but the vari­ant was not price-com­pet­i­tive be­cause it at­tracted a $10,000 pol­lu­tion penalty. It was soon with­drawn from the show­room.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent vari­ant with a 1.4-litre does not at­tract any pol­lu­tion sur­charge.</p>
    <p>SIZE</p>
    <p>The Oc­tavia is frac­tion­ally big­ger than the Altis in length (4,670mm ver­sus 4,630mm), width (1,814mm ver­sus 1,780mm) and height (1,461mm ver­sus 1,435mm). These di­men­sions give the Oc­tavia a slightly big­ger pres­ence on the road.</p>
    <p>But the Oc­tavia’s 2,680mm wheel­base is slightly shorter than the Altis’ 2,700mm. The 20mm dif­fer­ence may not seem much on pa­per, but trans­lates into slightly more cabin space in the Altis.</p>
    <p>In terms of boot space, the Oc­tavia’s 590 litres is sig­nif­i­cantly larger than the Altis’ 490 litres. The Altis’ stowage is al­ready rea­son­ably gen­er­ous, but if you fore­see ma­jor cargo-lug­ging du­ties, the Czech wins.</p>
    <p>LOOKS</p>
    <p>While the Oc­tavia may have a big­ger road pres­ence, it is the Altis that catches the eye.</p>
    <p>It is mod­ern-look­ing with a com­pletely new front bumper styling that re­sem­bles The Man­dalo­rian in the Star Wars Web tele­vi­sion spinoff.</p>
    <p>From the rear and sides, the Altis looks like a Camry, its larger sedan sib­ling.</p>
    <p>The Oc­tavia, on the other hand, is more staid and un­der­stated, which may make it more ev­er­green than the Altis in the long run.</p>
    <p>IN­TE­RIOR AND EQUIP­MENT</p>
    <p>The Altis’ cabin is zen-like and clut­ter-free. Driv­ers will be struck by the ab­sence of but­tons at the cen­tre con­sole.</p>
    <p>The i nfo­tain­ment sys­tem is a 7-inch touchcreen, and steer­ing­mounted but­tons al­low driv­ers to con­trol mul­ti­ple func­tions.</p>
    <p>The Oc­tavia’s cabin is equally fuss-free. Its in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem is in­tu­itive and in­te­grated with the cli­mate con­trol panel, giv­ing the car a clean and up­mar­ket feel.</p>
    <p>In terms of fea­tures, the Oc­tavia has two ad­van­tages over the Altis.</p>
    <p>Its touch­screen dis­play is not only big­ger than the Altis’ (8-inch ver­sus 7-inch), but it also has a built-in tyre pres­sure mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem that de­tects loss in tyre pres­sures.</p>
    <p>But its seats have to be ad­justed man­u­ally, com­pared with the Altis’ elec­tri­cally ad­justable driver seat.</p>
    <p>It also does not have a kick-boot sen­sor where driv­ers can open the boot with a kick­ing mo­tion be­low the rear bumper. This fea­ture in the Altis is use­ful for driv­ers who need to open the boot when their hands are full.</p>
    <p>PER­FOR­MANCE</p>
    <p>The Oc­tavia has a clear edge over the Altis in per­for­mance. It has a smaller power plant (1.4 litres ver­sus 1.6 litres), but it is tur­bocharged. Hence it puts out 148bhp and 250Nm ver­sus the nor­mally as­pi­rated Toy­ota’s 129bhp and 159Nm.</p>
    <p>This trans­lates into quicker ac­cel­er­a­tion – 8.2 sec­onds for the cen­tury sprint, com­pared with the Toy­ota’s 12.9 sec­onds – and a higher top speed of 219kmh, ver­sus the Altis’ 190kmh.</p>
    <p>On the move, the Altis has a more re­fined pow­er­train. Even on full throt­tle, the en­gine does not sound overly harsh.</p>
    <p>How­ever, en­thu­si­as­tic driv­ers will take a while to warm up to the Altis’ con­tin­u­ously vari­able trans­mis­sion. Ac­cel­er­at­ing to ex­press­way speeds with a heavy right foot raises an au­di­ble whine.</p>
    <p>If you want to avoid that, you have to coax it gen­tly up to a trot. And by then, many ve­hi­cles would of­ten have over­taken it.</p>
    <p>The Oc­tavia be­haves dif­fer­ently. While its Ja­panese coun­ter­part is meant to be driven at a leisurely pace, the Skoda can be driven like a sporty car – thanks to its re­fined seven-speed dual-clutch gear­box.</p>
    <p>But the Altis is the car to pick for a more com­fort­able and serene drive. There is less road roar from its Miche­lin Pri­macy tyres com­pared with the sporty Dun­lop Sport Maxx worn by the Oc­tavia.</p>
    <p>The Altis also has the edge in ride qual­ity – it is not too hard nor too soft, whereas the Oc­tavia has a de­cid­edly firmer ride.</p>
    <p>In terms of fuel con­sump­tion, the Altis av­er­aged about 9 litres/100km, which is higher than the of­fi­cial 6.4 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>Sur­pris­ingly, the Oc­tavia also av­er­aged 9 litres/100km, against its of­fi­cial fig­ure of 5.2 litres.</p>
    <p>In real life, the Oc­tavia is thus more im­pres­sive in this de­part­ment since it dishes out bet­ter per­for­mance than the Altis. It also at­tracts a lower road tax than the Toy­ota.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>There is no clear win­ner.</p>
    <p>The ap­peal of each car will de­pend on which as­pects the driver prefers.</p>
    <p>The Altis is likely to re­main the de­fault choice for most driv­ers be­cause of the sheer pull of the Toy­ota brand and its rep­u­ta­tion for de­pend­abil­ity. It is a well-equipped all-rounder, even though it is not a driver’s car.</p>
    <p>Keen driv­ers who do not want to sac­ri­fice driv­ing fun when per­form­ing fam­ily-fer­ry­ing du­ties ought to look at the Oc­tavia. It is within the Altis’ price range and of­fers the same spa­cious­ness and prac­ti­cal­ity.</p>
    <p>Be it the Altis or Oc­tavia, both are sound choices in their own right.</p>
