    <p>On Box­ing Day, Christie Nair’s be­lated Christ­mas and ad­vance birth­day present came in the form of win­ning the 100-110cm ju­nior (14 to 18 years) cat­e­gory at the SEA Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion Show Jump­ing De­vel­op­ment Chal­lenge, an event that could be the fu­ture for­mat of eques­trian in the Covid-19 era.</p>
    <p>De­spite it be­ing 13 months since she last took part in an in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion, the Sin­ga­porean, who turns 17 on Thurs­day, and her seven-year-old horse Co­ra­son placed first out of 17 rid­ers from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>What was dif­fer­ent this time was that there were only a hand­ful of lo­cal-based rid­ers at the Bukit Timah Sad­dle Club, as this four-cat­e­gory (ju­nior and open) com­pe­ti­tion was held si­mul­ta­ne­ously across four venues in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia (Se­lan­gor and Perak) and Thai­land (Sa­mut Prakan) due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Christie said: “I think this dig­i­talised event was so well-run and such a good al­ter­na­tive to nor­mal shows be­cause it gives us the same ex­po­sure to com­pet­ing at a large scale with more ex­pe­ri­enced rid­ers while mak­ing sure ev­ery­one is staying safe dur­ing the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>To en­sure con­sis­tency, all the venues had to put up a show jump­ing course con­cep­tu­alised by the of­fi­cial course de­signer. These must be iden­ti­cal, with the same height, dis­tance, and fence el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>All the jumps were broad­cast on­line us­ing Zoom and a panel of three judges from Malaysia then called the com­pe­ti­tion from the Eques­trian As­so­ci­a­tion of Malaysia (EAM) of­fice in Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>There were 51 en­tries from the three coun­tries across four classes.</p>
    <p>The Eques­trian Fed­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (EFS) said the South-east Asian Eques­trian Fed­er­a­tion took about three months to come up with the frame­work and guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The EAM con­ducted a trial dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion show jump­ing event for its lo­cal clubs in Oc­to­ber, be­fore the idea of an in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion emerged in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>EFS worked closely with Sport Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity to pull off the event, which fea­tured na­tional ath­letes, here.</p>
    <p>EFS gen­eral man­ager Shirley Khaw said: “The ob­jec­tive of this event is to give rid­ers the plat­form and op­por­tu­ni­ties to com­pete against rid­ers from other coun­tries, with­out hav­ing to leave their own coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The key chal­lenge is to en­sure that all re­spec­tive or­gan­is­ing venues must work to com­ply with their own coun­tries’ ex­ist­ing mea­sures and guide­lines, while en­sur­ing that the safety of all rid­ers, of­fi­cials and vol­un­teers re­main the top pri­or­ity and are not com­pro­mised.”</p>
    <p>The mea­sures in­cluded tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing, com­pul­sory wear­ing of masks ex­cept while they were mounted, and hav­ing no spec­ta­tors. All rosettes, medals and cer­tifi­cates were sent to the rid­ers by courier.</p>
    <p>While Khaw noted that a sim­i­lar for­mat had been in­tro­duced by world gov­ern­ing body In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion for Eques­trian Sports (FEI) in 2001 at the Jump­ing World Chal­lenge, the phys­i­cal pres­ence of FEI in­ter­na­tional judges were re­quired then.</p>
    <p>She be­lieves the Asean vari­a­tion could be the way to go for eques­trian if the coro­n­avirus re­mains.</p>
    <p>There are plans for an­other event in March or April, while the Asian Eques­trian Fed­er­a­tion is also ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of hold­ing an on­line con­ti­nen­tal event.</p>
    <p>Khaw said: “We are def­i­nitely ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of in­tro­duc­ing this to our other dis­ci­plines like dres­sage...</p>
    <p>“There is the need for us to think out of the box and get creative. The key is how to trans­form these chal­lenges into op­por­tu­ni­ties for the growth and de­vel­op­ment of our sport.”</p>
