    <p>• EVA Air, fa­mous for its Hello Kitty-themed flights, is the first Tai­wan-based air­line to of­fer flights to nowhere, paving the way for other air­lines to fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>The idea for such flights came from Deputy In­te­rior Min­is­ter Chen Tsung-yen, who is part of the Cen­tral Epi­demic Com­mand Cen­tre. “For plane main­te­nance, air­craft have to be flown once ev­ery three days,” said Mr Chen.</p>
    <p>EVA Air tested the wa­ters in July by work­ing with Song­shan In­ter­na­tional Air­port in Taipei to launch “pre­tend trips abroad” where peo­ple could check in at the air­port, en­joy duty-free shop­ping and board a plane that re­mained sta­tion­ary.</p>
    <p>When it was clear that even a firmly grounded plane was enough to keep cus­tomers com­ing, EVA Air be­gan de­sign­ing flights that would ac­tu­ally take off and fly around the is­land in time for Fa­ther’s Day on Aug 8. The tick­ets were all snapped up.</p>
    <p>China Air­lines has launched an iden­ti­cal pro­gramme with its bud­get car­rier Tig­erair Tai­wan. And new­comer Star­lux Air­lines, which mar­kets it­self as a high-end car­rier, also joined the scene.</p>
    <p>China Air­lines tar­geted fam­i­lies with young chil­dren, pro­vid­ing pi­lot and cabin crew uni­forms for the chil­dren. Tig­erair col­lab­o­rated with a pop­u­lar yakiniku restau­rant for its Fa­ther’s Day flight over Ja­pan’s Kyushu, a des­ti­na­tion fre­quented by Tai­wanese trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>After the Fa­ther’s Day cel­e­bra­tion flights, EVA Air was the only air­line that an­nounced a num­ber of flights to nowhere.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets are on sale for flights to cel­e­brate Tai­wan’s Na­tional Day on Oct 10, Hal­loween and Christ­mas, and also to ring in 2021 on New Year’s Eve.</p>
