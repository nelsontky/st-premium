    <p>The launch of the much-an­tic­i­pated travel bub­ble to fa­cil­i­tate leisure travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong has been fur­ther de­layed amid a ris­ing num­ber of Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong. The Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore said yes­ter­day that both cities have de­cided to de­fer the start of the air travel bub­ble to be­yond this month.</p>
    <p>The launch of the much-an­tic­i­pated travel bub­ble to fa­cil­i­tate leisure travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong has been fur­ther de­layed amid a ris­ing num­ber of Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) said yes­ter­day that both cities have de­cided to de­fer the start of the air travel bub­ble to be­yond this month, as the num­ber of lo­cal un­linked cases in Hong Kong is still high.</p>
    <p>The ex­act start date of the ar­range­ment will be re­viewed late this month.</p>
    <p>“Pas­sen­gers are ad­vised to con­tact their air­lines re­gard­ing their travel plans. The Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties have been in close dis­cus­sion and will up­date when there are fur­ther de­vel­op­ments,” said CAAS.</p>
    <p>The move fol­lows harsher so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to curb what the Hong Kong health au­thor­i­ties warned could be the city’s worst Covid-19 wave so far.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam told res­i­dents yes­ter­day that the next two weeks will be crit­i­cal, as she urged res­i­dents to stay at home.</p>
    <p>The city has been record­ing more than 70 new daily Covid-19 in­fec­tions for over a week. Its to­tal tally has crossed 6,300 cases, in­clud­ing 109 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of un­linked lo­cal Covid-19 cases rose to 16 as at Mon­day. Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong had pre­vi­ously agreed that the travel bub­ble ar­range­ment would be sus­pended if the num­ber ex­ceeded five in ei­ther city.</p>
    <p>The bub­ble would have al­lowed trav­ellers to fly be­tween the cities with no re­stric­tions on the pur­pose of travel. Trav­ellers would have to take Covid-19 tests in­stead of serv­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The first air travel bub­ble flight was orig­i­nally planned for Nov 22, but both gov­ern­ments an­nounced on Nov 21 that it would be de­layed.</p>
    <p>They said at the time that they would re­view the sit­u­a­tion by early this month.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, which was due to op­er­ate air travel bub­ble flights, said it sup­ported the de­lay.</p>
    <p>It said af­fected cus­tomers can re­book their flights or re­quest a full re­fund.</p>
    <p>Ms Ali­cia Seah, di­rec­tor of pub­lic re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Dy­nasty Travel, said the agency had re­ceived sev­eral book­ings for tour pack­ages to Hong Kong for the midDe­cem­ber to Christ­mas pe­riod.</p>
    <p>While ac­knowl­edg­ing that the de­lay is un­for­tu­nate, she added: “It’s really (about) putting the health and safety of trav­ellers as the top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand that the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties need to pre­vent the fur­ther spread of in­fec­tion while main­tain­ing eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties in a care­fully planned and mea­sured way.”</p>
    <p>An­other travel agency, Chan Broth­ers, said that since most cus­tomers had been adopt­ing a wai­t­and-see ap­proach to­wards the air travel bub­ble, the de­fer­ments have not made a big dif­fer­ence to book­ings and can­cel­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise that the sit­u­a­tion is a rapidly evolv­ing one, and the bag­gage of un­cer­tainty that th­ese travel bub­bles come with may dis­cour­age at least some trav­ellers,” said Chan Broth­ers.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, travel bub­bles can be a cau­tiously op­ti­mistic first step to a post-pan­demic fu­ture... a suc­cess­ful im­ple­men­ta­tion can in­stil con­fi­dence for oth­ers in dis­cus­sion, as well as spark sim­i­lar fu­ture di­a­logues with prospec­tive des­ti­na­tions.”</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong has set up a hot­line for res­i­dents to re­port par­ties aboard yachts and rented party boats, as the fi­nan­cial hub tight­ens so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules to con­tain a surge i n coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>With night­clubs and karaoke par­lours clos­ing as a re­sult of a new round of re­stric­tions, some peo­ple were host­ing rule-break­ing gath­er­ings at sea, Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam told a weekly news brief­ing yes­ter­day ahead of a meet­ing of her ad­vi­sory Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Hold­ing par­ties aboard rented “junks” in Hong Kong’s iconic har­bour and off out­ly­ing is­lands is a favourite week­end pas­time.</p>
    <p>“The re­port­ing hot­line newly set up is there be­cause we see that af­ter party rooms and karaoke par­lours have been made to close, there are a num­ber of peo­ple who or­gan­ise events at sea,” Ms Lam said. “We want to tar­get such a breach.”</p>
    <p>The lo­cal po­lice force, which has al­ready launched a hot­line for po­ten­tial breaches of the city’s con­tro­ver­sial na­tional se­cu­rity law, has also posted a mes­sage on Face­book call­ing on res­i­dents to alert it to par­ties at sea.</p>
    <p>Boats rented or mar­keted for gath­er­ings could fall foul of the mea­sures, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>“While sched­uled premises such as bars, bath­houses and party rooms have been closed ac­cord­ing to the law, the po­lice have no­ticed that a num­ber of ves­sels have been hired for so­cial gath­er­ing,” the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>“Even pri­vately owned yachts are some­times used for such pur­pose. This has greatly in­creased the risk of trans­mis­sion of disease.”</p>
    <p>While Hong Kong cur­rently lim­its pub­lic gath­er­ings to two peo­ple, the gov­ern­ment has not capped the num­ber of peo­ple who can meet in pri­vate.</p>
    <p>A po­lice rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined to elab­o­rate on the rules yes­ter­day and whether they would have any ef­fect on pri­vate par­ties hosted by yacht own­ers, re­fer­ring only to the ear­lier Face­book post.</p>
    <p>TAR­GET­ING BREACHES</p>
    <p>The re­port­ing hot­line newly set up is there be­cause we see that af­ter party rooms and karaoke par­lours have been made to close, there are a num­ber of peo­ple who or­gan­ise events at sea.</p>
