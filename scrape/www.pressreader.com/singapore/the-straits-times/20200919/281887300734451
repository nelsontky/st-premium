    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion will ban video-shar­ing app TikTok and WeChat from US app stores start­ing to­mor­row night, a move that will block Amer­i­cans from down­load­ing the Chi­ne­se­owned plat­forms over con­cerns that they pose a na­tional se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s ac­tions prove once again that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump will do ev­ery­thing in his power to guar­an­tee our na­tional se­cu­rity and pro­tect Amer­i­cans from the threats of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party,” Com­merce Sec­re­tary Wil­bur Ross said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party has demon­strated the means and mo­tives to use these apps to threaten the na­tional se­cu­rity, for­eign pol­icy and the econ­omy of the US,” he added.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent TikTok users will see lit­tle change to­mor­row and US Com­merce Depart­ment of­fi­cials said they will not bar ad­di­tional tech­ni­cal trans­ac­tions for TikTok un­til Nov 12, which gives the firm time to see if owner ByteDance can clinch an agree­ment over the fate of its US op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The ban on new US down­loads of the widely pop­u­lar app could still be re­scinded by Pres­i­dent Trump be­fore it takes ef­fect.</p>
    <p>ByteDance has been in talks with Or­a­cle Corp and oth­ers to cre­ate a new com­pany, TikTok Global, that aims to ad­dress US con­cerns about the se­cu­rity of its users’ data.</p>
    <p>ByteDance still needs Mr Trump’s ap­proval to stave off a US ban.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment or­der bars Ap­ple’s app store, Al­pha­bet’s Google Play and oth­ers from of­fer­ing the apps on any plat­form “that can be reached from within the United States”, a se­nior Com­merce Depart­ment of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment said the ac­tions will “pro­tect users in the US by elim­i­nat­ing ac­cess to these ap­pli­ca­tions and sig­nif­i­cantly re­duc­ing their func­tion­al­ity”.</p>
    <p>The or­der will not ban US com­pa­nies from do­ing busi­nesses on WeChat out­side the United States, which will be wel­come news to US firms such as Wal­mart and Star­bucks that use WeChat’s em­bed­ded “mini-app” pro­grammes to fa­cil­i­tate trans­ac­tions and en­gage con­sumers in China, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The or­der will also not bar trans­ac­tions with WeChat owner Ten­cent Hold­ings’ other busi­nesses, in­clud­ing its on­line gam­ing op­er­a­tions, and will not pro­hibit Ap­ple, Google or oth­ers from of­fer­ing TikTok or WeChat apps any­where out­side the US.</p>
    <p>The bans are in re­sponse to a pair of ex­ec­u­tive or­ders is­sued by Mr Trump on Aug 6 that gave the Com­merce Depart­ment 45 days to de­ter­mine what trans­ac­tions to block from the apps that he deemed a na­tional se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>That dead­line ex­pires to­mor­row. Com­merce Depart­ment of­fi­cials said they were tak­ing the ex­tra­or­di­nary step be­cause of the risks the apps’ data col­lec­tion poses.</p>
    <p>China and the com­pa­nies have de­nied that US user data is col­lected for spy­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ross said in his state­ment: “We have taken sig­nif­i­cant ac­tion to com­bat China’s ma­li­cious col­lec­tion of Amer­i­can ci­ti­zens’ per­sonal data, while pro­mot­ing our na­tional val­ues, demo­cratic rules-based norms, and ag­gres­sive en­force­ment of US laws and reg­u­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has ramped up ef­forts to purge “un­trusted” Chi­nese apps from US dig­i­tal net­works and has called TikTok and WeChat “sig­nif­i­cant threats”.</p>
    <p>TikTok has 100 mil­lion users in the US and is es­pe­cially pop­u­lar among younger Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>WeChat has had an av­er­age of 19 mil­lion daily ac­tive users in the US, an­a­lyt­ics firms App­topia said early last month.</p>
    <p>It is pop­u­lar among Chi­nese stu­dents, ex­pa­tri­ates and some Amer­i­cans who have per­sonal or busi­ness re­la­tion­ships in China.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment will not seek to com­pel peo­ple in the US to re­move the apps or stop us­ing them, but will not al­low up­dates or new down­loads.</p>
    <p>“We are aim­ing at a top cor­po­rate level. We’re not go­ing to go out af­ter the in­di­vid­ual users,” one Com­merce Depart­ment of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Over time, of­fi­cials said, the lack of up­dates will de­grade the apps us­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pec­ta­tion is that peo­ple will find al­ter­na­tive ways to do these ac­tions,” a se­nior of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment is also bar­ring ad­di­tional tech­ni­cal trans­ac­tions with WeChat start­ing to­mor­row that will sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce the us­abil­ity and func­tion­al­ity of the app in the US.</p>
    <p>There may be spo­radic out­ages as well, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
