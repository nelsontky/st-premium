    <p>What is a habit or hobby you picked up this year?</p>
    <p>I started pri­vate pole-danc­ing classes at Slap Dance Stu­dio after the cir­cuit breaker, once classes were al­lowed to re­sume.</p>
    <p>I have al­ways wanted to pick up a sport which would im­prove my fit­ness, in­volve some kind of danc­ing and allow me to fly, since travel is re­stricted. What better way than to climb a pole, swing around it and have the clos­est feel­ing to fly­ing?</p>
    <p>It has been close to five months and it has been the best de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>I feel stronger, my pos­ture has im­proved and I have be­come more com­fort­able with my body since we have to prac­tise and learn this art form in a bikini.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for this is prac­ti­cal as the dance re­quires you to grab the pole with your thighs and skin con­tact is important.</p>
    <p>What is your New Year’s res­o­lu­tion?</p>
    <p>To keep per­form­ing and do­ing shows both on (video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form) Zoom and on the stage live.</p>
    <p>I would like to be a part of pilot projects that would allow me to per­form for a live au­di­ence, as this is one thing I have missed.</p>
    <p>I would also like to di­rect at least two the­atre projects and in­crease my social me­dia pres­ence by writ­ing and act­ing in comedy sketches.</p>
    <p>It would be ideal to come up with a show that shines a spot­light on women’s is­sues, such as gen­der equal­ity, equal pay and sex­ual health.</p>
    <p>These top­ics need to be dis­cussed more so we can better rep­re­sent women in so­ci­ety.</p>
