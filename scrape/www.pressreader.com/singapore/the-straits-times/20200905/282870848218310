    <p>FUN­NY­MAN IN FAKE NEWS: Swindlers have been us­ing fake celebrity news in get-rich-quick cryp­tocur­rency scams. Just ask lo­cal co­me­dian Mark Lee (left).</p>
    <p>A web­site claimed re­cently that Lee, 51, had been hos­pi­talised due to a gunshot wound in an at­tempted mur­der af­ter an in­ter­view. He had sup­pos­edly said his top moneymaker was a “cryp­tocur­rency auto-trad­ing pro­gramme called Bit­coin Profit”.</p>
    <p>But there was at least one sign that some­thing was amiss. The web­site claimed the in­ter­view was con­ducted by lo­cal tele­vi­sion pre­sen­ter “Wong” Youyi, though her sur­name is ac­tu­ally Lin.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day night, Lee took to his of­fi­cial Face­book and In­sta­gram ac­counts to re­fute the re­port.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in English, he urged the pub­lic not to fall for such scams. “I didn’t even know I was shot and hos­pi­talised. Had made po­lice re­port but they said noth­ing can be done as it is from Europe. Any­one know what can I do?”</p>
    <p>He added in Chi­nese whether he should com­fort him­self that he is fa­mous in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a po­lice ad­vi­sory in May, such fake ar­ti­cles are paid on­line ad­ver­tise­ments de­signed to en­tice vic­tims to click on links in the ar­ti­cle. By click­ing on a link, read­ers will be brought to an­other web­site of­fer­ing in­vest­ments in fi­nan­cial prod­ucts such as cryp­tocur­rency.</p>
    <p>Lee, who rose to fame in</p>
    <p>Chan­nel 8 va­ri­ety show Com­edy Nite in the 1990s, is the lat­est lo­cal celebrity to be a vic­tim of such fake news, af­ter the likes of direc­tor</p>
    <p>Jack Neo, singer Ste­fanie Sun and ac­tor Li Nanx­ing.</p>
