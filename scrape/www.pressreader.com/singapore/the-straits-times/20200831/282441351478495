    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>Con­sis­tency is key. Stay­ing ac­tive, train­ing hard and mak­ing sure I stay con­sis­tent with my fit­ness regime.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a time when you were not fit and fab?</p>
    <p>I have been ac­tive al­most my en­tire life, starting sports as early as when I was six years old. I have al­ways par­tic­i­pated in sport­ing events, sporty co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties and was al­ways learn­ing new sports.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, I am not fol­low­ing a strict diet. Gen­er­ally, I try to keep a bal­ance of a high-pro­tein, high­car­bo­hy­drates and low-fat diet. I eat four or five times a day.</p>
    <p>I love cook­ing and cook most of the time. I eat a lot of chicken, beef and eggs with rice, bread or pasta. But over the week­end, I usu­ally in­dulge in pizza and what­ever I want.</p>
    <p>What are your in­dul­gences? Pizza, Yole frozen yo­gurt, matcha ice cream and fried food.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>Work­ing in a gym makes it con­ve­nient for me to train.</p>
    <p>I al­ways in­te­grate my work­outs in be­tween per­sonal train­ing with my clients.</p>
    <p>What are the three most im­por­tant things in your life?</p>
    <p>Food, hav­ing good times with good com­pany and go­ing to the beach.</p>
    <p>What’s your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>My favourite is my abs and least favourite is my ham­strings.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and af­ter a work­out?</p>
    <p>I do not have a “be­fore” and “af­ter” rou­tine, but I do plug into my favourite mu­sic dur­ing my work­out to get into the zone.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant is it for you to keep up with your fit­ness rou­tine?</p>
    <p>Fit­ness has al­ways been a very im­por­tant part of my life. It is im­por­tant for me to make sure I in­cor­po­rate stay­ing ac­tive in my daily life. It is es­sen­tially the blue­print I fol­low.</p>
    <p>I start my day at 6am and end at about 5pm. I work out in be­tween train­ing my clients.</p>
    <p>How are you keep­ing fit dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>I have been do­ing weight train­ing, con­duct­ing group vir­tual ex­er­cise classes, cy­cling and run­ning.</p>
    <p>What are the changes you have made to keep ex­er­cis­ing dur­ing this time?</p>
    <p>When the fit­ness cor­ners were closed, I used bodyweight rings and bar­bells to ex­er­cise at open spa­ces out­side, such as carparks. I also used dumb­bells at home.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive lifestyle in­flu­enced your family and friends?</p>
    <p>I prac­tise what I preach, es­pe­cially to my friends and clients.</p>
    <p>Be­ing ac­tive, stay­ing fit, liv­ing a sus­tain­able lifestyle, train­ing con­sis­tently and cook­ing reg­u­larly have greatly im­pacted quite a few of my friends and clients in one way or an­other.</p>
    <p>These habits have also en­cour­aged them to be con­sis­tent.</p>
    <p>The food I cook in­cludes grilled or air-fried chicken and sliced beef, pro­tein pan­cakes and salad.</p>
    <p>What’s the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fit­ness?</p>
    <p>Out of all t he sports I have com­peted in, muay thai and body­build­ing com­pe­ti­tions are the more ex­treme sports I have tried.</p>
    <p>Would you go for plas­tic surgery? The only surgery I would con­sider is breast aug­men­ta­tion. Some women who com­pete i n body­build­ing com­pe­ti­tions un­dergo such a surgery.</p>
    <p>We lose over­all body fat quickly, in­clud­ing the area around the chest, while pre­par­ing for com­pe­ti­tions, so breast aug­men­ta­tion surgery main­tains the size.</p>
    <p>Do you think you’re sexy?</p>
    <p>I do feel sexy. Liv­ing and keep­ing an ac­tive lifestyle re­ally makes me feel good.</p>
    <p>It all comes with it – if you train hard, you will look good and once you look good, you feel good and con­fi­dent.</p>
