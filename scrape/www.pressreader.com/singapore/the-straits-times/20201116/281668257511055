    <p>Law firm Allen & Gled­hill, one of the Big Four here, has been named in all 15 cat­e­gories of the in­au­gu­ral Sin­ga­pore’s Best Law Firms 2021 rank­ing – the only one to be so named.</p>
    <p>But the top two po­si­tions in the crim­i­nal l aw cat­e­gory went to smaller out­fits – Tri­dent Law Cor­po­ra­tion and Eu­gene Thu­raisingam LLP.</p>
    <p>The spread of small and large firms fea­tured in the rank­ing re­flects the di­verse na­ture of the le­gal ser­vices mar­ket here, a sur­vey un­der­taken by The Straits Times and Ger­man-based re­search firm Statista has found.</p>
    <p>The re­sults re­leased to­day are based on feed­back from pro­fes­sion­als in the le­gal sec­tor and clients, who re­sponded to the sur­vey con­ducted be­tween June 9 and Aug 8 this year.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 98 firms are rep­re­sented in 15 dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories, with 265 men­tions.</p>
    <p>Firms that made it into the “Best Of” in a le­gal cat­e­gory will be able to ob­tain a li­cence to use an of­fi­cial seal cre­ated for the rank­ing.</p>
    <p>The eye-catch­ing seal fea­tures the trade­marks of The Straits Times and Statista.</p>
    <p>The list has fa­mil­iar mar­ket lead­ers as well as niche firms with strong skills in the re­spec­tive cat­e­gories, from bank­ing and neg­li­gence law to crim­i­nal and com­mer­cial law.</p>
    <p>Ad­san Law emerged as the best law firm in the cat­e­gory for char­i­ties, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions and pro bono work.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 4,716 re­spon­dents took part in the on­line sur­vey and over 10,000 rec­om­men­da­tions for awards were re­ceived in to­tal.</p>
    <p>“The re­sponse was im­pres­sive, al­most over­whelm­ing,” said an­a­lyst Chris­tian Leve, who is in charge of var­i­ous law firm projects Statista does around the world.</p>
    <p>He added that the strong re­sponse was driven by the reach and rep­u­ta­tion of The Straits Times and the ef­forts of the Sin­ga­pore Cor­po­rate Coun­sel As­so­ci­a­tion, which had reached out to many lawyers.</p>
    <p>All rec­om­men­da­tions were an­a­lysed and stud­ied and the top firms were iden­ti­fied and ranked ac­cord­ing to the num­ber of rec­om­men­da­tions they gar­nered.</p>
    <p>“The Sin­ga­pore le­gal pro­fes­sion is well known for its breadth and depth of qual­ity lawyers. Guides like this pro­vide more in­for­ma­tion for po­ten­tial clients and give some mea­sure of feed­back to the firms,” said Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore l aw fac­ulty dean Si­mon Chesterman.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne-based in­no­va­tion and strat­egy con­sul­tant Dharmendra Ya­dav said: “It is im­por­tant that The Straits Times, as the pri­mary broad­sheet in Sin­ga­pore, has been able to lend its ground ex­per­tise to bench­mark law firms. This will en­gen­der con­fi­dence in these firms.”</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tions pre­vi­ously worked on two other projects – Sin­ga­pore’s Fastest Grow­ing Com­pa­nies and Sin­ga­pore’s Best Em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, ed­i­torin-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ (SPH) English, Malay and Tamil Me­dia Group and edi­tor of The Straits Times, said: “Our ex­pe­ri­ence with the first two projects gave us con­fi­dence that Statista is the right part­ner to work with on this new project to fo­cus on le­gal ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This will be both of in­ter­est to read­ers and also use­ful to them when they need to seek le­gal ad­vice and ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>Dr Friedrich Sch­wandt, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Statista, said: “For us, it is al­ways a plea­sure to part­ner with SPH and The Straits Times on mega re­search projects such as this one – in gen­eral, but also with the spe­cific view that Sin­ga­pore is our Asia hub, with our of­fice here con­stantly grow­ing.”</p>
