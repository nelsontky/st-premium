    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralian of­fi­cials fo­cused on the grim task of dis­pos­ing al­most 400 whale car­casses yes­ter­day, while at­tempts to res­cue the few re­main­ing sur­vivors of one of the world’s worst mass strand­ings were ex­pected to be ex­tended for an­other day.</p>
    <p>Res­cuers had man­aged to free al­most 90 of the long-finned pi­lot whales beached off the coun­try’s south­ern coast by late yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of those freed had reached deeper wa­ter, of­fi­cials said, but four had to be eu­thanised and oth­ers might re­turn when the tide turns.</p>
    <p>The clock was tick­ing for a small group of whales still floun­der­ing in shal­low wa­ter on a wide sand­bank,</p>
    <p>four days af­ter the 470-strong pod was first spot­ted off the north­west coast of Tas­ma­nia.</p>
    <p>“There is a like­li­hood that we will be con­tin­u­ing the res­cue ef­forts tomorrow,” said Mr Nic Deka, the in­ci­dent con­troller for the state gov­ern­ment’s Parks and Wildlife Ser­vice. “While we have live an­i­mals that have a chance and we have the crew to shift them, we will give it a go,” he told a me­dia brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a pos­i­tive ve­teri­nary as­sess­ment, a res­cue at­tempt would con­tinue today for a mother and calf that ap­peared in footage posted by lo­cal me­dia on Twit­ter. The video showed the calf swimming among res­cuers as they tried to save its mother.</p>
    <p>Along­side these mea­sures, the</p>
    <p>au­thor­i­ties were also de­vel­op­ing a plan to dis­pose of around 380 dead whales at sea. Op­tions in­cluded load­ing the car­casses onto a barge or gath­er­ing them into a group to tow, Mr Deka said, adding that a barge with a crane at­tached was due to ar­rive on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Eu­thanis­ing those an­i­mals too ex­hausted to swim to safety was an­other daunt­ing but nec­es­sary task, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Dr Mike Dou­ble, a zo­ol­o­gist that leads the Aus­tralian Ma­rine Mam­mal Cen­tre, told Reuters: “For large whales, very sadly, it could take weeks for them to die, and they get blis­tered in the sun, so you would be think­ing about an eth­i­cal and hu­mane thing to do.”</p>
