    <p>We didn’t ex­pect to have such high recorded lev­els of mi­croplas­tics, par­tic­u­larly given how care­ful our sam­pling ap­proach was. There­fore, our re­sults are a con­ser­va­tive es­ti­mate of how much mi­croplas­tic there is in deep sea sed­i­ments.</p>
    <p>DR DENISE HARDESTY, from the oceans and at­mos­phere unit of Aus­tralia’s Com­mon­wealth Sci­en­tific and In­dus­trial Re­search Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists in Aus­tralia have cal­cu­lated for the first time the amount of mi­croplas­tics in the deep ocean.</p>
    <p>Us­ing data from sediment cores ex­tracted from the sea floor in a re­mote area off south­ern Aus­tralia, the sci­en­tists es­ti­mated that about 14 mil­lion tonnes of mi­croplas­tics, pro­duced when dis­carded plas­tics are bro­ken down over time, have ac­cu­mu­lated in deep sea sed­i­ments glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Dr Denise Hardesty, prin­ci­pal re­search scientist and co-au­thor of the study pub­lished on Mon­day in the Fron­tiers In Marine Sci­ence jour­nal, said: “The find­ings high­light the ex­tent of plas­tic pol­lu­tion, and show that no area of the ocean is im­mune to the plas­tic pol­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>What star­tled the re­searchers was the con­cen­tra­tion of mi­croplas­tics in the sam­ples.</p>
    <p>“Across all the stud­ies on deep sea mi­croplas­tics, our find­ings are up to 25 times higher than some other stud­ies,” said Dr Hardesty, who is from the oceans and at­mos­phere unit of the Com­mon­wealth Sci­en­tific and In­dus­trial Re­search Or­gan­i­sa­tion, Aus­tralia’s na­tional sci­ence agency.</p>
    <p>“The area we sam­pled is in a re­mote lo­ca­tion, far from any ur­ban pop­u­la­tion cen­tre. We didn’t ex­pect to have such high recorded lev­els of mi­croplas­tics, par­tic­u­larly given how care­ful our sam­pling ap­proach was,” she told The Straits Times in an e-mail. “There­fore, our re­sults are a con­ser­va­tive es­ti­mate of how much mi­croplas­tic there is in deep sea sed­i­ments.”</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists col­lected sediment core sam­ples from six lo­ca­tions in the Great Aus­tralian Bight us­ing a re­motely op­er­ated ro­bot. The lo­ca­tions were 288km to 356km off the South Aus­tralian coast and at depths of 1,655m to just over 3,000m.</p>
    <p>Based on the re­sults of deep sea plas­tic den­si­ties, and scal­ing up to the size of the ocean, the sci­en­tists cal­cu­lated the global es­ti­mate of mi­croplas­tics on the sea floor.</p>
    <p>Ex­actly where the plas­tic in the South Aus­tralia sam­ples came from is un­clear.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists noted that other stud­ies have pre­dicted the move­ment of sur­face par­ti­cles, in­clud­ing plas­tic pol­lu­tion, to­wards the south of Aus­tralia from as far as Asia and Africa.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, an es­ti­mated 8.5 mil­lion tonnes of plas­tic en­ter the oceans, with the i tems rang­ing from shop­ping bags and food con­tain­ers to cig­a­rette lighters and soft drink bot­tles.</p>
    <p>A lot of the waste is dumped and car­ried by rivers out to sea, with East Asia be­ing the top global source.</p>
    <p>An­i­mals such as seabirds and whales eat float­ing plas­tic waste think­ing it is food. Oth­ers be­come en­snared and drown; dis­carded fish­ing nets are a ma­jor killer.</p>
    <p>Huge amounts of waste also wash up on beaches or float just be­low the sur­face.</p>
    <p>Much of it breaks down over time into smaller and smaller pieces un­til they be­come mi­croplas­tic pieces that range from 5mm to as small as 1 mi­crome­tre (one mil­lionth of a me­tre).</p>
    <p>Dr Hardesty said: “Mi­croplas­tics in par­tic­u­lar, due to their tiny size, can be eaten by a va­ri­ety of marine</p>
    <p>wildlife, in­clud­ing plank­ton, crus­taceans and fish.</p>
    <p>“This can have a knock-on ef­fect, as when mi­croplas­tics en­ter the</p>
    <p>marine food web at low lev­els, they can move up the food chain as big­ger species eat smaller ones.”</p>
    <p>That in­cludes hu­mans, re­search</p>
    <p>has shown, though the health im­pact is still un­clear.</p>
    <p>“As a global com­mu­nity, I’m not sure we want plas­tics through­out the world’s most re­mote lo­ca­tions, much less in our drink­ing wa­ter, or in our food,” Dr Hardesty added.</p>
    <p>But while 14 mil­lion tonnes sounds like a lot, it is a frac­tion of the to­tal amount of plas­tic waste that has been dumped into the ocean over the years.</p>
    <p>With only about 250,000 tonnes es­ti­mated to be float­ing on the sur­face, where is the rest of the plas­tic?</p>
    <p>Dr Hardesty said pre­vi­ous work by her and her col­leagues has shown that much of what en­ters the oceans ends up back on shores and beaches, par­tic­u­larly in the back­shore veg­e­ta­tion. “We sug­gest that most of the ‘miss­ing plas­tic’ is ac­tu­ally on our coasts.”</p>
    <p>Also, where plas­tic pol­lu­tion ends up de­pends on whether the marine de­bris sinks or floats. For ex­am­ple, her team has found that plas­tic pol­lu­tion on land dif­fers from what is found on the sea floor.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, in a pre­vi­ous study we found that cig­a­rette butts, plas­tic frag­ments, bot­tle caps and food wrap­pers are com­mon on land, though rare on the seabed.</p>
    <p>“En­tan­gling items such as fish­ing lines, ropes and plas­tic bags are com­mon on the sea floor.”</p>
