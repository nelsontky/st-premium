    <p>BEI­JING • China has given one of its most de­tailed ex­pla­na­tions yet for the sour­ing of ties with Aus­tralia, calling on the na­tion to stop try­ing to im­pose its will on oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing back on China-Aus­tralia re­la­tions in the past few years, we see some peo­ple in Aus­tralia ad­here to a Cold War men­tal­ity and har­bour ide­o­log­i­cal prej­u­dice, re­gard China’s de­vel­op­ment as a threat, and have then made a se­ries of wrong moves re­lated to China,” said For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian at a daily brief­ing in Bei­jing on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“This is the root cause for China-Aus­tralia re­la­tions wors­en­ing to the cur­rent dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion,” Mr Zhao said.</p>
    <p>In a sign that some se­nior mem­bers of Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son’s gov­ern­ment want to find a cir­cuit-breaker to ease the ten­sions, Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg was to de­liver a speech yes­ter­day say­ing his na­tion is ready to re-engage in di­a­logue with Bei­jing after min­is­te­rial con­tacts were put on ice.</p>
    <p>Ties be­tween the two key trad­ing part­ners have been strained since 2018, when Can­berra barred Huawei Tech­nolo­gies from build­ing its 5G net­work.</p>
    <p>But re­la­tions have re­ally been in the deep freeze since Mr Mor­ri­son’s gov­ern­ment in April led calls for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus out­break – a move that bruised China’s pride and un­leashed a tor­rent of crit­i­cism that Aus­tralia is a pup­pet of the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao also re­jected com­ments from Aus­tralian Trade Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham that “the ball is very much in China’s court to come to the ta­ble for that di­a­logue”, mak­ing clear that Bei­jing ex­pected Can­berra to act first.</p>
    <p>He added that the ac­tions of Can­berra and some Aus­tralians had “se­ri­ously hurt the feel­ings of the Chi­nese peo­ple”. Mr Zhao’s com­ments came as Mr Mor­ri­son was in Tokyo to sign a de­fence agree­ment with Ja­pan and strengthen the al­ready close ties be­tween those two na­tions.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan and Aus­tralia are try­ing to build a coali­tion of “like-minded” democ­ra­cies in the Indo-Pa­cific to push back against what they view as Bei­jing’s in­creas­ing ex­pan­sion­ism in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent dif­fi­cul­ties fac­ing China-Aus­tralia re­la­tions are not some­thing China wants to see. Re­spon­si­bil­ity for caus­ing this sit­u­a­tion has noth­ing to do with China,” Mr Zhao said.</p>
    <p>“We hope the Aus­tralian side will ad­mit to the real rea­son, look at China and China’s de­vel­op­ment ob­jec­tively, earnestly han­dle our re­la­tions based on prin­ci­ples of mu­tual re­spect and equal treat­ment and do more to en­hance mu­tual trust and co­op­er­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>In a ra­dio in­ter­view yes­ter­day, Mr Birm­ing­ham re­peated his as­ser­tion that the “ball is very much in China’s court”.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao also reeled off a list of ways in which the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment or its peo­ple had dam­aged re­la­tions with Bei­jing: Aus­tralia, in vi­o­la­tion of ba­sic norms gov­ern­ing in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions, “has re­peat­edly made mis­takes on is­sues in­volv­ing Hong Kong, Xin­jiang, Tai­wan and other is­sues re­lat­ing to China’s core in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>He said that de­spite a lack of ev­i­dence, some in Aus­tralia “slan­dered and ac­cused China of en­gag­ing in so-called in­ter­ven­tion and in­fil­tra­tion ac­tiv­i­ties” in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>They “politi­cised and stig­ma­tised nor­mal ex­changes be­tween China and Aus­tralia with­out jus­ti­fi­ca­tion”, he said. Aus­tralia en­gaged in “po­lit­i­cal ma­nip­u­la­tion” on Covid-19 and “pro­moted the so­called in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tion and in­ter­fered in in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion”, Mr Zhao said.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent dif­fi­cul­ties fac­ing China-Aus­tralia re­la­tions are not some­thing China wants to see... We hope the Aus­tralian side will ad­mit to the real rea­son, look at China and China’s de­vel­op­ment ob­jec­tively, earnestly han­dle our re­la­tions based on prin­ci­ples of mu­tual re­spect and equal treat­ment and do more to en­hance mu­tual trust and co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>MR ZHAO LI­JIAN, For­eign Min­istry spokesman.</p>
