    <p>As i nvi­ta­tions roll out by text mes­sage for some to re­ceive their Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions, scam­mers are get­ting in on the act to dupe mem­bers of the public.</p>
    <p>Text mes­sages, pur­port­edly from a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany ap­proved to pro­vide the Covid-19 vac­cine, have asked re­cip­i­ents to click on a link or make a phone call to sched­ule ap­point­ments for vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) last Thurs­day put up a no­tice urg­ing peo­ple to be wary of such scams and to ver­ify the au­then­tic­ity of text mes­sages be­fore pro­vid­ing per­sonal or fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“The text mes­sages are not from MOH, and MOH did not ap­prove any phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany to con­tact any­one di­rectly. We urge re­cip­i­ents not to re­spond to the mes­sages,” the no­tice said.</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Chng, 65, a writer, re­ceived such a mes­sage last Tues­day. It was from a num­ber she did not recog­nise and bore the name “CHUANXIN”.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage, which read “Mo­dena, an Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany, has been ap­proved to pro­vide you with Covid-19 vac­cine”, in­structed her to mes­sage an­other num­ber on What­sApp for reg­is­tra­tion. She did not do so.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has kicked off its na­tion­wide vac­ci­na­tion drive, with Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong among those re­ceiv­ing the jab last Fri­day. MOH has started send­ing out SMS invitation­s to those who are el­i­gi­ble to regis­ter for the vac­ci­na­tion, start­ing with health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>Those who re­ceive invitation­s should check that the link in the SMS ends with “.gov.sg” be­fore click­ing on it, said the min­istry on its web­site.</p>
    <p>They should also not for­ward mes­sages to oth­ers, as each invitation is unique, it added.</p>
    <p>MOH has also warned of an­other scam in which calls or text mes­sages falsely in­form re­cip­i­ents that they have been in close prox­im­ity to some­one who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These mes­sages re­quest per­sonal or fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion in re­turn for a test kit and re­sults.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to ver­ify the au­then­tic­ity of such mes­sages, or who have more ques­tions about the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise, can call the MOH hot­line on 1800-333-9999.</p>
