    <p>As Asia re­cov­ers from the fall­out of Covid-19, build­ing and in­vest­ing in in­fras­truc­ture can help to create jobs and boost the econ­omy, said Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, said Sin­ga­pore sees in­fras­truc­ture as a way to boost the econ­omy, and that while con­struc­tion was halted dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, it has re­sumed on projects like the North-South Cor­ri­dor.</p>
    <p>She said: “In­fras­truc­ture can be used to prime the econ­omy, pro­vided it’s planned right and you have the rel­e­vant mea­sures in place for safe dis­tanc­ing. In the short term, a lot of at­ten­tion has to be paid to Covid-19... (but) in­vestors are still look­ing for good qual­ity in­fras­truc­ture in­vest­ments.”</p>
    <p>She made the point dur­ing an on­line panel dis­cus­sion yes­ter­day ti­tled “Reignit­ing Asia’s In­fras­truc­ture Plans: What Are The pri­or­i­ties now?”. It was or­gan­ised by the Bri­tish news­pa­per Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>The other pan­el­lists were Asian In­fras­truc­ture In­vest­ment Bank (AIIB) chief econ­o­mist Erik Ber­glof and pen­sion fund Aus­tralianSu­per deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive and chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Mark De­laney.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee said gov­ern­ments that are look­ing to bor­row should take ad­van­tage of the cur­rent low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>An area with strong po­ten­tial is sus­tain­able in­fras­truc­ture, which spans the en­tire econ­omy – from fi­nanc­ing and plan­ning, to de­sign, con­struc­tion, op­er­a­tions and main­te­nance, she added.</p>
    <p>But it has to be done right from the out­set, she said, cit­ing Ten­gah, an up­com­ing de­vel­op­ment which has been dubbed Sin­ga­pore’s first smart en­ergy town, pow­ered by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>“For de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, it is a chance to get it right from the very be­gin­ning, rather than do it the old way and then have to go back and retro­fit it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ber­glof agreed that, postCovid-19, in­fras­truc­ture must be thought of in new ways and that a more holis­tic ap­proach is needed.</p>
    <p>On this count, he said, AIIB has in­vested more heav­ily in health­care than it did pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate, closed-door, round-ta­ble ses­sion with se­nior rep­re­sen­ta­tives from in­fras­truc­ture com­pa­nies, In­fras­truc­ture Asia (IA) ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Seth Tan said that in or­der to re­alise the “im­mense” op­por­tu­ni­ties from sus­tain­able in­fras­truc­ture, co-cre­ation be­tween gov­ern­ments and the pri­vate sec­tor is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>He said: “This sends the sig­nal that we want the in­fras­truc­ture of the fu­ture, and also helps with de­risk­ing (projects) so that the pri­vate sec­tor can come in to in­vest and bring in tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>IA, jointly set up by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, works with de­vel­op­ers, fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment banks to bro­ker in­fras­truc­ture deals and share best prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants also flagged chal­lenges. Mr Ku­nal Shah, the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of waste so­lu­tions firm Anaer­gia, noted that it con­tin­ues to be dif­fi­cult to get mul­ti­lat­eral agen­cies to bridge the fi­nanc­ing gap.</p>
    <p>KPMG prin­ci­pal David Ng said sus­tained gov­ern­ment ef­forts are needed to en­sure a con­ducive reg­u­la­tory frame­work: “It goes back to proper project prepa­ra­tion to make sure that the value of sus­tain­able in­fras­truc­ture is un­der­stood.”</p>
    <p>Mr Andy Hodgson, ad­vi­sory ser­vices leader for pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm Arup, said the lack of ca­pac­ity and ca­pa­bil­ity is an is­sue.</p>
    <p>“There seems to be a mis­con­cep­tion that schemes which oth­er­wise aren’t seen as bank­able, if they have a green as­pect to them, sud­denly be­come in­vestible,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Low Kian Min, chief de­vel­op­ment of­fi­cer of en­ergy firm Jera, noted that re­new­able en­ergy may not be ap­pro­pri­ate in coun­tries which need agri­cul­tural land to sus­tain liveli­hoods. In such cases, tra­di­tional sources of en­ergy may still be re­quired, he said.</p>
