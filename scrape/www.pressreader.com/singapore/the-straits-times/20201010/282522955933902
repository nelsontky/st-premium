    <p>Coast­ing with the en­gine off is a lit­tle eerie. You feel like you are in a well-in­su­lated pedal car, pushed by un­seen hands.</p>
    <p>The facelifted Audi A5 Sport­back al­lows for en­gine-off coast­ing – more so than pre­vi­ous mod­els equipped with this fuel-sav­ing fea­ture.</p>
    <p>The re­vised A5 has a 12-volt “mild hy­brid” sys­tem which helps crank up the en­gine elec­tri­cally each time the throt­tle is ap­plied to rouse the car from its stop-start slum­ber.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem also gen­er­ates power which is stored in a sep­a­rate bat­tery. This is used to power the elec­tri­cal sys­tem, which to­day con­trols al­most all of a car’s func­tions.</p>
    <p>As such, there must be suf­fi­cient power re­serve in the mild hy­brid bat­tery for en­gine-off coast­ing to take place. Oth­er­wise, the car’s steer­ing and brakes may not work well, which would be scary.</p>
    <p>In the A5, dis­em­bod­ied mo­tion comes on most fre­quently on the ex­press­way, when your foot is off the throt­tle and the road is flat.</p>
    <p>The moment it hap­pens is al­most im­per­cep­ti­ble. The tachome­ter reads zero and you ex­pect the Audi to slow down al­most im­me­di­ately, but it goes on.</p>
    <p>In fact, that is one thing you no­tice about the re­vised A5 Sport­back – its un­canny abil­ity to main­tain speed for well over 100m af­ter you have lifted off. Ever so of­ten, I would have to tap the brake pedal be­cause the Audi’s mo­men­tum does not wear off when I ex­pected it to.</p>
    <p>This free-wheel­ing na­ture makes up for the times when the A5 is less re­spon­sive than de­sired, such as in stop-start traf­fic. With 150hp, this base vari­ant of the A5 Sport­back is not the nip­pi­est thing in the city.</p>
    <p>Its stop-start sys­tem can also be a pain when you are merg­ing from a small lane. That mi­cro sec­ond it takes for the en­gine to go from stop to start some­times makes an oth­er­wise mun­dane ma­noeu­vre nervy.</p>
    <p>But on ex­press­ways, the A5 re­deems it­self. It cruises with the easy non­cha­lance of a big­gerengined car, aug­mented by oc­ca­sional lighter-than-air en­gine-off coast­ing.</p>
    <p>Nes­tled in its sporty yet cushy driver’s seat, you marvel at how ef­fort­less a car with less than 100hp per tonne of body weight can feel.</p>
    <p>Its fuel ef­fi­ciency is not too shoddy ei­ther. Av­er­ag­ing 8.8 litres/100km by the end of the test-drive, it falls short of the 6.4 litres/100km de­clared by Audi, but ex­ceeds real-world fig­ures posted by some cars of its size.</p>
    <p>Space-wise, the facelifted Sport­back is un­changed. You get a huge boot, but three oc­cu­pants in the sec­ond row is a bit of a squeeze.</p>
    <p>The facelifted car looks a tad sleeker, with a flat­ter, wider grille and larger side in­takes in front. Full LED lights with dy­namic in­di­ca­tors are stan­dard is­sued. A dif­fuser insert with trape­zoidal tailpipes makes the rear ap­pear wider, giv­ing the car a more planted look.</p>
    <p>In­side, a new touch­screen in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem packs new fea­tures, in­clud­ing a very use­ful 360-de­gree cam­era. The sys­tem can be paired with your phone and you can keep track of the car on the phone – a nifty fea­ture if say, your teenage son bor­rows your ride.</p>
    <p>Speed alert, valet alert, ge­ofence alert and mileage tracker are some of the other func­tions. You can even op­er­ate the door locks re­motely.</p>
    <p>Just five years ago, this would have been down­right eerie.</p>
