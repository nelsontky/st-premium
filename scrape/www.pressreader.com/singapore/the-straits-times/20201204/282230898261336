    <p>De­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the dis­rup­tion in trade and cap­i­tal flows and eco­nomic down­turn that it caused this year, Sin­ga­pore has been ranked the world’s sec­ond-most con­nected coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic was ranked first for the size of its in­ter­na­tional flows in goods, cap­i­tal, in­for­ma­tion and peo­ple rel­a­tive to its do­mes­tic econ­omy in this year’s edi­tion of the DHL Global Con­nect­ed­ness In­dex (GCI).</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sin­ga­pore missed out on the top spot in the over­all GCI rank­ing by just two points, as the Nether­lands took first place with a to­tal score of 91 points. Both coun­tries main­tained their po­si­tions from the pre­vi­ous edi­tion of the list.</p>
    <p>The GCI – com­piled ev­ery al­ter­nate year by the Deutsche Post DHL Group in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the New York Univer­sity (NYU) Leonard N. Stern School of Busi­ness – is a de­tailed anal­y­sis based on more than 3.5 mil­lion data points that track the glob­al­i­sa­tion of 169 economies.</p>
    <p>The rest of the top 10 po­si­tions in the over­all rank­ing were taken by Bel­gium, the United Arab Emi­rates, Ire­land, Switzer­land, Lux­em­bourg, the United King­dom, Den­mark and Malta.</p>
    <p>The GCI has two sep­a­rate rank­ings mea­sur­ing each econ­omy’s global con­nect­ed­ness based on the size of its in­ter­na­tional flows rel­a­tive to the size of its do­mes­tic econ­omy – re­ferred to as “depth” – and the ex­tent to which the flows are dis­trib­uted glob­ally – or “breadth”.</p>
    <p>The depth lead­ers – economies with the high­est pro­por­tions of flows cross­ing bor­ders – are Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong, Bel­gium, the Nether­lands and Es­to­nia.</p>
    <p>The breadth cham­pi­ons – economies with the most global flow pat­terns – are the United King­dom, the United States, the Nether­lands, Is­rael and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that swept the world this year and in­creased the dis­tance be­tween na­tions, com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als, the GCI 2020 re­port was ti­tled The State Of Global is at ion In A Dis­tanc­ing World.</p>
    <p>Dr Steven Alt­man, se­nior re­search scholar at NYU Stern and di­rec­tor of the DHL Ini­tia­tive on Glob­al­i­sa­tion, said that while so­cial dis­tanc­ing has been es­sen­tial for pub­lic health, the pan­demic ex­ac­er­bated geopo­lit­i­cal and so­ci­etal fault lines, com­pound­ing the chal­lenges of con­trol­ling the spread of Covid-19 and keep­ing economies func­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>Glob­al­i­sa­tion did not col­lapse this year, but the pan­demic did trans­form – at least tem­po­rar­ily – how coun­tries con­nect, he said. So as travel plum­meted, dig­i­tal flows surged. In­ter­na­tional trade and in­vest­ment took strong hits at the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic and then started to re­cover, he noted.</p>
    <p>“My hope is that the Covid-19 jolt to glob­al­i­sa­tion will, with due re­flec­tion, fo­cus minds on how to strengthen our con­nec­tions to foster a health­ier, more pros­per­ous and more re­silient fu­ture,” said Dr Alt­man, who is also one of the au­thors of the GCI re­port.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the re­port, the world’s level of global con­nect­ed­ness is set to de­cline this year, ow­ing to the pan­demic. How­ever, it is un­likely to fall be­low lev­els seen dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008 and 2009.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional trade re­bounded strongly af­ter a sharp plunge at the on­set of the pan­demic. Still, the pro­por­tion of global out­put cross­ing na­tional bor­ders will de­cline mod­estly this year.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple flows suf­fered an un­prece­dented de­cline this year as na­tions closed bor­ders to curb the spread of the virus. In­ter­na­tional travel is on track to fall all the way back to its 1990 level.</p>
    <p>While de­bate con­tin­ues about the fu­ture of glob­al­i­sa­tion, global flow data reaf­firms that the world is, and will re­main, only par­tially glob­alised, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>All signs point to a fu­ture where in­ter­na­tional flows will re­main so large that de­ci­sion-mak­ers ig­nore them at their peril, even as bor­ders and cross-coun­try dif­fer­ences con­tinue to make do­mes­tic ac­tiv­ity the de­fault in most ar­eas.</p>
