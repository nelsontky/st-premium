    <p>A ques­tion posed by Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai sparked a pro­tracted de­bate in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, with sev­eral op­po­si­tion MPs ques­tion­ing Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo on the Govern­ment’s ef­forts to pro­tect lo­cal PMETs from be­ing dis­placed by for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>In her speech, Mrs Teo said the num­ber of lo­cals in pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) jobs has grown by about 35,000 a year on av­er­age be­tween 2014 and last year. In the same pe­riod, the num­ber of Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) and S Pass hold­ers grew by fewer than 9,000 a year, she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, asked how many peo­ple be­came per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) and new cit­i­zens dur­ing that pe­riod. He added that pre­vi­ously re­ported data put the num­ber at around 50,000 a year.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo ac­knowl­edged that around 20,000 peo­ple be­come cit­i­zens every year, while an­other 30,000 be­come PRs. “I think what Mr Leong is try­ing to sug­gest is that all of your gains are mean­ing­less be­cause they are all oc­cu­pied by PRs and cit­i­zens,” she said.</p>
    <p>But this is not the case, the min­is­ter added. A sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of new cit­i­zens and PRs are chil­dren who are not part of the work­force, while oth­ers are mar­ried to cit­i­zens. One in three mar­riages now is be­tween a cit­i­zen and non-cit­i­zen, she noted.</p>
    <p>“Is Mr Leong sug­gest­ing that these new cit­i­zens are any less of a cit­i­zen? Is Mr Leong sug­gest­ing there­fore that we should dis­count them, not in­clude them?” Mrs Teo asked.</p>
    <p>She sug­gested that Sin­ga­pore­ans should in­stead look at the big­ger pic­ture of the in­creased pro­por­tion of lo­cals in PMET jobs, and de­cide if this is an “amaz­ing ac­com­plish­ment” not eas­ily achieved elsewhere.</p>
    <p>She also asked Mr Leong if Sin­ga­pore should start dis­tin­guish­ing be­tween new cit­i­zens and “real” cit­i­zens, and, if so, how many years of cit­i­zen­ship would qual­ify a per­son as a “real” cit­i­zen.</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing, Mr Leong said: “Whether it’s the orig­i­nal Sin­ga­pore­ans or the new Sin­ga­pore­ans, we ac­tu­ally do not make that dis­tinc­tion.”</p>
    <p>He added that his is­sue was with the im­pact of each year’s crop of new cit­i­zens and PRs on the ex­ist­ing pop­u­la­tion. If there are 50,000 new cit­i­zens and PRs each year, but the num­ber of lo­cals in PMET jobs in­creases by only 35,000, then there is an un­de­ni­able pres­sure on the PMET job mar­ket, he said. “So the sit­u­a­tion is not as rosy as what you have painted.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo ac­knowl­edged his point of view, but re­it­er­ated her ear­lier points that many new cit­i­zens and PRs are either not in the work­force or mar­ried to Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“They have a fam­ily nexus. Are we to say: ‘Please don’t work. Please be out of the work­force,’” she asked. “I don’t be­lieve Mr Leong is say­ing that at all. How­ever, this con­stant ob­ses­sion – if I may put it that way – with draw­ing lines, I’m not sure is good for us as a so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>She urged MPs to con­sider these is­sues care­fully and think about the val­ues and at­ti­tudes that drive such ques­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is not that the ques­tion can­not be asked, but I think we have to search our hearts and ask our­selves, be­fore ask­ing these ques­tions: What is our think­ing? What is our at­ti­tude? And what is the value that we are ex­press­ing by even putting this ques­tion for­ward?”</p>
    <p>When Mr Leong rose again, Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin point­edly asked him if he was go­ing to an­swer the min­is­ter’s ques­tions. “It’s fine if you don’t want to an­swer the ques­tion posed to you,” Mr Tan added.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong moved on to ask about an­other is­sue.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) then asked if the</p>
    <p>Govern­ment be­lieves that slow­ing down the growth of EP and S Pass hold­ers is suf­fi­cient to pre­vent lo­cal PMETs from get­ting dis­placed.</p>
    <p>He added that it is mis­lead­ing to com­pare both num­bers, given that the over­all base num­bers in both groups are dif­fer­ent. This means the slow­down in the growth rate of EP and S Pass hold­ers is “less dra­matic” than what Mrs Teo said.</p>
    <p>Many PMET po­si­tions may have al­ready been filled by for­eign­ers, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim added, mak­ing it no sur­prise that the re­quired num­ber of EP and S Pass hold­ers has gone down.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo replied: “I merely stated the facts, I did not say that one con­trib­uted to the other. I stated the facts; this is what they were.”</p>
    <p>As for Prof Lim’s ques­tion on whether Sin­ga­pore is sat­is­fied with how much it has slowed the growth rate of EP and S Pass hold­ers, Mrs Teo said her min­istry has four aims.</p>
    <p>These are to keep em­ploy­ment high and un­em­ploy­ment low, as well as help Sin­ga­pore­ans achieve in­come growth and re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy. If this can be done with­out us­ing for­eign­ers as a com­ple­ment to the work­force, and re­duc­ing the re­liance on man­power-in­ten­sive meth­ods of work in cer­tain sec­tors, the an­swer is yes, she said.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore, as a small citys­tate, has con­straints. Still, it needs to find the best so­lu­tions, she added.</p>
    <p>She asked the House to imag­ine a sce­nario where the num­ber of EP and S Pass hold­ers has shrunk sig­nif­i­cantly, and like­wise, the job op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans. “Is that go­ing to be bet­ter for us? Well, we’ll have to think very hard about whether the an­swer is yes.”</p>
    <p>ON NEW CIT­I­ZENS</p>
    <p>Is Mr Leong sug­gest­ing that these new cit­i­zens are any less of a cit­i­zen? Is Mr Leong sug­gest­ing there­fore that we should dis­count them, not in­clude them? ’’</p>
    <p>MAN­POWER MIN­IS­TER JOSEPHINE TEO, ad­dress­ing a ques­tion from NCMP Leong Mun Wai and not­ing that a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of new cit­i­zens and PRs are chil­dren who are not part of the work­force, while oth­ers are mar­ried to cit­i­zens.</p>
