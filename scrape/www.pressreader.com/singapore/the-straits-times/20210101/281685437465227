    <p>Dozens of el­derly South Korean coro­n­avirus pa­tients were trans­ferred from nurs­ing homes to hos­pi­tals this week fol­low­ing crit­i­cism that gov­ern­ment pol­icy had led to a spike in deaths among the vul­ner­a­ble res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions passed 60,000 yes­ter­day, as 967 ad­di­tional cases were re­ported.</p>
    <p>At least 486 of South Korea’s 900 re­ported deaths were of peo­ple over the age of 80. Only 40 deaths have been re­ported among peo­ple younger than 60.</p>
    <p>At least 316 res­i­dents of nurs­ing hos­pi­tals or nurs­ing homes have died, the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of the record 40 deaths in one day re­ported by KDCA on Tues­day, 70 per cent were res­i­dents of nurs­ing homes or nurs­ing hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>“Since most of the hos­pi­talised in the nurs­ing homes are el­derly and with un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions, they are at a high risk of death when in­fected with Covid-19,” Mr Choi Dae-zip, pres­i­dent of the Korean Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, told a news con­fer­ence. “They should be given pri­or­ity for hos­pi­tal beds and re­ceive proper treat­ment.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kim Dong-hyun, pres­i­dent of the Korean So­ci­ety of Epi­demi­ol­ogy, said the gov­ern­ment was re­peat­ing mis­takes it had made dur­ing ear­lier waves of in­fec­tion, sim­i­lar to mis­takes made in the United States and Europe.</p>
    <p>“Even if they sep­a­rate the in­fected pa­tients to other floors and rooms, trans­mis­sion is in­evitable,” he said.</p>
    <p>At a nurs­ing hos­pi­tal in Seoul’s Guro dis­trict, at least 102 res­i­dents and 69 med­i­cal staff have been in­fected, while seven res­i­dents have died of the coro­n­avirus since the first case was re­ported at the fa­cil­ity on Dec 15.</p>
    <p>Another 22 cases were linked to the clus­ter there.</p>
    <p>By yes­ter­day, all but one coro­n­avirus pa­tient at the nurs­ing hos­pi­tal had been trans­ferred to reg­u­lar hos­pi­tals, while 246 res­i­dents who were not in­fected were moved to other fa­cil­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have trans­ferred out all con­firmed cases from eight of the 10 nurs­ing homes that have re­ported cases, health of­fi­cial Yoon Tae-ho told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 40 con­firmed coro­n­avirus pa­tients were still at the two re­main­ing fa­cil­i­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Yoon pre­vi­ously said that the gov­ern­ment had de­cided to treat pa­tients at the nurs­ing homes be­cause it was eas­ier to care for them by send­ing med­i­cal staff to the fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>South Korea has been mulling over rais­ing its so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to the high­est level, but the au­thor­i­ties have hes­i­tated for fear of po­ten­tially dev­as­tat­ing eco­nomic out­comes by hav­ing more than two mil­lion multi-use fa­cil­i­ties un­dergo lim­i­ta­tions in busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said a de­ci­sion on this will be made to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tral Dis­as­ter and Safety Coun­ter­mea­sure Head­quar­ters said that of­fi­cials are in dis­cus­sion with ex­perts and lo­cal gov­ern­ments to come up with a new plan from Mon­day, as the cur­rent rules will cease by the end of Sun­day.</p>
