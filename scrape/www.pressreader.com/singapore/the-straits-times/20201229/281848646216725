    <p>On Jan 20, Mr Joe Bi­den will be in­au­gu­rated as the 46th pres­i­dent of the United States. Over the next four years, South-east Asian states should pre­pare for US en­gage­ment with the re­gion to return to a more tra­di­tional mid­dle ground be­tween the Obama and Trump ad­min­is­tra­tions that were out­liers on op­po­site ends of the en­gage­ment spec­trum.</p>
    <p>After more than a decade of ab­nor­mal en­gage­ment be­tween Amer­ica and South-east Asia, and fac­ing a more as­sertive and ag­gres­sive China, this return to some­thing more nor­mal is to be wel­comed.</p>
    <p>Un­like pres­i­dent Barack Obama, Mr Bi­den has no strong per­sonal nar­ra­tive link­ing him to South-east Asia. Nor do Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris and Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin, Mr Bi­den’s choices for sec­re­tary of state and de­fence chief, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia does not pro­vide Mr Bi­den with the same op­por­tu­nity it did for pres­i­dent Obama in 2009 to dif­fer­en­ti­ate his ad­min­is­tra­tion from the pre­ced­ing Repub­li­can one.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama’s pivot to the Asia-Pa­cific was a pivot that started in South-east Asia, away from Amer­ica’s wars in the Mid­dle East that be­gan dur­ing the Ge­orge W. Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Sign­ing Asean’s Treaty of Amity and Co­op­er­a­tion in South-east Asia and re­ceiv­ing an Asean in­vi­ta­tion to the East Asia Sum­mit (EAS) com­prised a key early fo­cus of pres­i­dent Obama’s dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion strat­egy.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Europe and Nato will pro­vide Mr Bi­den with his dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion op­por­tu­nity. Mr Don­ald Trump’s dis­mis­sive at­ti­tude to­wards di­plo­matic deco­rum, climate change, mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and US al­liances dis­rupted trans-At­lantic re­la­tions more than trans-Pa­cific ones. Mr Bi­den and Mr Blinken, given their long­stand­ing ties with Europe and Canada, are well placed to re­pair re­la­tions with both.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the en­gage­ment spec­trum, Pres­i­dent Trump did not at­tend a sin­gle EAS ple­nary ses­sion and only one Asean-US sum­mit.</p>
    <p>In his three trips to the re­gion, Mr Trump spent more time with, and at­ten­tion on, North Korea’s despot Kim Jong-un than he did with any South-east Asian leader.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Bi­den likely will spend more time in South-east Asia and with the re­gion’s lead­ers. These lead­ers should return the com­pli­ment and spend more time at the White House than they did when Mr Trump was in residence.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar mid­dle-ground out­come for South-east Asia is likely for key is­sues that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion has pri­ori­tised.</p>
    <p>Over­all, this list is more favourable and less dis­con­cert­ing than the one high­lighted by Mr Trump in 2016 that re­jected mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and promised pu­ni­tive trade mea­sures but less so than by Mr Obama in 2008.</p>
    <p>South-east Asian lead­ers wel­comed Mr Obama’s rhetor­i­cal em­brace of en­gage­ment with the re­gion and Asean. South-east Asian lead­ers coun­selled that this rhetoric must be matched by ac­tion, par­tic­u­larly in re­la­tion to push­ing back against China’s ag­gres­sive ac­tions in the South China Sea and in putting in place an eco­nomic com­po­nent to the pivot to Asia. China’s cap­ture of Scarboroug­h Shoal and the Obama pres­i­dency end­ing with the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade deal not rat­i­fied dis­ap­pointed many in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>But for some South-east Asian states the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion may be less favourable and more dis­con­cert­ing than the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. Viet­nam, an au­thor­i­tar­ian party-state and a front-line state in the South China Sea dis­pute may have the most to worry about, while Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte of the Philip­pines may well face re­newed hu­man rights crit­i­cisms of his ex­tra-ju­di­cial war on drugs that could plum­met US-Philip­pine re­la­tions back into crisis.</p>
    <p>THREE KEY COM­MIT­MENTS</p>
    <p>Three key Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion com­mit­ments will be wel­comed by all South-east Asian states: a more pro­fes­sional ap­proach to the ap­point­ment of se­nior of­fi­cials in­clud­ing am­bas­sadors; a strong com­mit­ment to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and “show­ing up” at Asean-led fo­rums; and a more se­lec­tive, less con­fronta­tional ap­proach to Amer­ica’s strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion with China.</p>
    <p>South-east Asian coun­tries and Asean will pro­vide a good early test of these com­mit­ments. Sin­ga­pore and Asean would cer­tainly wel­come the early con­fir­ma­tion of US am­bas­sadors after fail­ing to get one dur­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The Asean Re­gional Fo­rum, the Asean De­fence Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing Plus and the EAS min­is­te­rial meet­ings in 2021 will be ex­pect­ing ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion by Mr Blinken and Mr Austin. If Mr Bi­den does not come to Brunei for the Asean-US Sum­mit and EAS in Novem­ber next year, he will be seen to have failed the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has pledged to make ad­dress­ing climate change a sig­na­ture pol­icy of his ad­min­is­tra­tion. When he takes of­fice next month, one of his first acts will be to can­cel Mr Trump’s with­drawal from the Paris agree­ment on climate change.</p>
    <p>This will be wel­comed by South-east Asian coun­tries, not only be­cause it demon­strates a firm com­mit­ment to mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proaches to solv­ing the world’s prob­lems, but also be­cause they are in­creas­ingly con­cerned about the im­pact of climate change on the re­gion, es­pe­cially the grow­ing fre­quency of costly nat­u­ral dis­as­ters caused by se­vere weather events.</p>
    <p>FIND­ING THE SWEET SPOT IN CHINA POL­ICY</p>
    <p>In South-east Asia, Mr Bi­den’s ap­proach to China will be the mostly keenly watched pol­icy of the new ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The rapid de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in US-China re­la­tions over the past four years has been a source of anx­i­ety for re­gional states. In­creas­ingly, South-east Asians be­lieve that the re­gion has be­come the pri­mary arena for su­per­power ri­valry.</p>
    <p>While a de­gree of US-China com­pe­ti­tion al­lows re­gional states to play one ma­jor power off the other, out­right con­fronta­tion could im­pose un­palat­able choices on the Asean mem­bers that limit their political au­ton­omy and hence the re­gion as a whole.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, South-east Asian states want the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to find the sweet spot in US-China re­la­tions: they do not want to see a return to the in­ef­fec­tive ap­proach of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion which em­bold­ened Bei­jing in the South China Sea but they also do not want to see a con­tin­u­a­tion of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s an­tag­o­nis­tic pos­ture to­wards China.</p>
    <p>Find­ing that sweet spot will be dif­fi­cult, es­pe­cially in the South China Sea. Some Asean states wel­comed Mr Trump’s tougher South China Sea strat­egy which in­cluded stronger sup­port for free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion and bring­ing US pol­icy in line with the 2016 Ar­bi­tral Tri­bunal award (which ruled China’s ju­ris­dic­tional claims in the water­way were in­com­pat­i­ble with the UN Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea).</p>
    <p>How­ever, other Asean mem­bers have ex­pressed con­cern that the grow­ing pres­ence of both US and Chi­nese war­ships in the South China Sea could lead to a mil­i­tary clash.</p>
    <p>HU­MAN RIGHTS AND DEMOC­RACY</p>
    <p>Per­haps the big­gest source of dis­agree­ment be­tween South-east Asian states and Amer­ica over the next four years will be over hu­man rights and democ­racy. Mr Bi­den has de­clared that they will be at the heart of his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s for­eign pol­icy. No South-east</p>
    <p>Asian coun­try will wel­come in­creased US scru­tiny of their do­mes­tic pol­i­tics, es­pe­cially the more au­thor­i­tar­ian states.</p>
    <p>An­other area of frus­tra­tion in US-South-east Asia ties will be Amer­ica’s ab­sence from eco­nomic blocs such as the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship and the Asean-con­ceived Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship. Mr Bi­den will be cau­tious about com­mit­ting the US to ei­ther, given that many Amer­i­cans be­lieve that free trade deals only cre­ate un­em­ploy­ment at home.</p>
    <p>Over­all, South-east Asian coun­tries will wel­come the re­ver­sion to tra­di­tional US for­eign pol­icy set­tings and be­hav­iour un­der Mr Bi­den, es­pe­cially Amer­i­can lead­er­ship and a com­mit­ment to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism. They will be hope­ful but ap­pre­hen­sive about the fu­ture tra­jec­tory of US-China re­la­tions over the next four years. They will have to put up with Amer­i­can lec­tur­ing over political rights.</p>
    <p>As for Pres­i­dent Bi­den, he should talk more to South-east Asian lead­ers than Pres­i­dent Trump did and lis­ten to them more than pres­i­dent Obama did.</p>
