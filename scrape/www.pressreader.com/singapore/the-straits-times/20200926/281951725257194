    <p>BANGKOK The hash­tag #Repub­lic of Thai­land trended on Twit­ter in Thai­land yes­ter­day af­ter a de­ci­sion by Par­lia­ment to de­lay pos­si­ble changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion in­fu­ri­ated pro­test­ers in the king­dom.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing more than two months of anti-gov­ern­ment protests, some protest lead­ers have said they seek re­forms to re­duce the pow­ers of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn but not to make Thai­land a repub­lic.</p>
    <p>The repub­li­can hash­tag, in English rather than Thai, had been used in more than 820,000 tweets and was the top trend­ing hash­tag in Thai­land, ac­cord­ing to Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace did not com­ment and has made no re­sponse to re­quests for com­ment on the protests or the de­mands for royal re­form.</p>
    <p>Thai­land be­came a con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy when ab­so­lute monar­chy ended in 1932, but the King’s pow­ers have in­creased since he in­her­ited the throne in 2016.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment spokesman Anucha Bu­ra­pachaisri said he had not seen the hash­tag and de­clined to com­ment. Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha did not com­ment on the hash­tag but told re­porters that na­tional se­cu­rity was para­mount and that pro­test­ers would be pros­e­cuted if they broke the law.</p>
    <p>He said he had no prob­lem with amend­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion but it was up to Par­lia­ment to de­cide on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivist Parit “Pen­guin” Chi­warak said the anger showed the gov­ern­ment should ad­dress at least some of the pro­test­ers’ de­mands – in­clud­ing a 10-point call for royal re­forms.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple are des­per­ate for re­form, they’re think­ing of rev­o­lu­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“More des­per­a­tion will lead to more ag­gres­sion.”</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment, dom­i­nated by sup­port­ers of the gov­ern­ment, voted on Thurs­day to de­lay mak­ing a de­ci­sion on whether it would amend the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion par­lia­men­tar­i­ans and pro­test­ers ac­cused the leg­is­la­ture of try­ing to buy time.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers seek changes to a char­ter they say was drafted to en­sure Mr Prayut, a for­mer junta leader who took power in 2014, kept his post af­ter an elec­tion last year. They also want his de­par­ture. Mr Prayut says the elec­tion was fair.</p>
    <p>Last weekend, tens of thou­sands of pro­test­ers cheered calls for re­form of the monar­chy, which the Con­sti­tu­tion says must be held “in a po­si­tion of revered wor­ship”.</p>
    <p>The King, who spends most of his time in Europe, paid a rare visit to Thai­land on Thurs­day for cer­e­monies hon­our­ing his grand­fa­ther, Prince Mahi­dol Adulyadej.</p>
    <p>Mr Warong Dechgitvi­grom, who led a march to Par­lia­ment with hun­dreds of roy­al­ists on Wed­nes­day to op­pose con­sti­tu­tional change, said the trend­ing hash­tag was proof of col­lu­sion with for­eign­ers seek­ing dom­i­nance over Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“The Thai monar­chy is the soul of the na­tion. If this is weak­ened, it will cre­ate con­flicts and make it easy for them to in­ter­fere,” he said. “Most Thai peo­ple don’t want a repub­lic.”</p>
