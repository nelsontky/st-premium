    <p>Changi Air­port Group’s (CAG) net profit at­trib­ut­able to share­holder fell by 36 per cent in the fi­nan­cial year ended March 31, as the Covid-19 pan­demic ate into its bot­tom line. The profit dropped to $435 mil­lion in FY2019/20, from $677 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port Group’s (CAG) net profit at­trib­ut­able to share­holder fell by 36 per cent in the fi­nan­cial year ended March 31, as the Covid-19 pan­demic ate into its bot­tom line.</p>
    <p>The profit dropped to $435 mil­lion, from $677 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>To­tal rev­enue for the fi­nan­cial year rose by 3 per cent from $3.04 bil­lion to $3.12 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, to­tal ex­penses, in­clud­ing de­pre­ci­a­tion and amor­ti­sa­tion, in­creased by 6 per cent from $2.12 bil­lion to $2.25 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>CAG at­trib­uted the rise to higher de­pre­ci­a­tion and op­er­at­ing ex­penses with Jewel’s open­ing and the com­ple­tion of the Ter­mi­nal 1 ex­pan­sion project.</p>
    <p>The group said it had per­formed well in the first 10 months of FY2019/20 due to strong travel de­mand and the open­ing of Jewel Changi Air­port, but business con­di­tions “de­te­ri­o­rated sharply” in Fe­bru­ary as the Covid-19 out­break started to spread glob­ally.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est an­nual re­port re­leased yes­ter­day, for­mer chair­man Liew Mun Leong and chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Seow Hiang said in a joint mes­sage that the group’s strong per­for­mance in the first 10 months of the year was “se­verely negated by the col­lapse in air travel”.</p>
    <p>CAG has cut the salaries of its man­age­ment and staff by up to 30 per cent to cope with the sig­nif­i­cant im­pact of Covid-19 on its fi­nan­cial re­sults and con­serve cash due to the un­cer­tainty ahead, they said.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that se­nior man­age­ment had their pay cut by up to 15 per cent in April. The cuts were ex­panded to all staff in CAG in July, rang­ing from 3 per cent to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>In a fur­ther cost-cut­ting at­tempt, CAG has also rec­om­mended no div­i­dend pay­out to its share­holder, the Min­istry of Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger traf­fic at Changi fell 33 per cent in Fe­bru­ary and 71 per cent in March, com­pared with a year ago.</p>
    <p>This re­sulted in Changi Air­port see­ing pas­sen­ger traf­fic de­cline 5.1 per cent for the year, to 62.9 mil­lion. This is the first yearly pas­sen­ger traf­fic de­cline since 2008/09, when the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis struck.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, con­ces­sions rev­enue dropped by 4.9 per cent com­pared with the last fi­nan­cial year. This was due to a 57.5 per cent drop in rev­enue in Fe­bru­ary and March af­ter the pan­demic struck, said CAG.</p>
    <p>Its overseas in­vest­ments also con­trib­uted to the hit to the ac­counts.</p>
    <p>CAG had to make a one-off non­cash im­pair­ment of as­sets in Rio de Janiero’s Tom Jo­bim In­ter­na­tional Air­port, in which it owns a 51 per cent stake. This re­sulted in a re­duc­tion in net profit by $200 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>On the mega Ter­mi­nal 5 project, which has been paused for at least two years, CAG said there will be stud­ies to re­assess air traf­fic de­mand pro­jec­tions and see how the project’s de­sign might be af­fected in a post-pan­demic world.</p>
    <p>But it stressed that T5 re­mains a crit­i­cal long-term in­fras­truc­ture in­vest­ment for the fu­ture of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In CAG’s an­nual re­port, Mr Liew and Mr Lee said re­cov­ery in the travel sec­tor is highly de­pen­dent on how coun­tries man­age bor­der con­trols, air travel re­quire­ments and the de­vel­op­ment of vi­able med­i­cal treat­ments for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“The fu­ture does ap­pear daunt­ing with the sit­u­a­tion show­ing no signs of abate­ment,” they said.</p>
    <p>But CAG will con­tinue to work with agen­cies and part­ners to seek so­lu­tions for safe travel, they added. “The avi­a­tion in­dus­try re­mains promis­ing in the long term as there is still a need and de­mand from peo­ple to fly again, both for leisure and business.”</p>
