    <p>Thou­sands of mi­grants have been left stranded with­out shel­ter af­ter fires razed Greece’s big­gest refugee camp. Lo­cals are re­sist­ing the Greek gov­ern­ment’s plans to pro­vide tem­po­rary shel­ter for the mi­grants, fear­ing it will turn into another per­ma­nent mi­grant camp.</p>
    <p>LES­BOS (Greece) • Thou­sands of mi­grants re­mained stranded with­out shel­ter on the is­land of Les­bos for a third day yes­ter­day, sleep­ing on streets or in fields near Greece’s largest refugee camp af­ter fires burned the fa­cil­ity to the ground.</p>
    <p>The Mo­ria camp, long no­to­ri­ous for its poor liv­ing con­di­tions, had hosted more than 12,000 mi­grants, four times its stated ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Po­lice re­in­force­ments ar­rived in Les­bos yes­ter­day. Eleven po­lice ve­hi­cles – some stop­ping the mi­grants from reach­ing a nearby port – and two wa­ter can­non boosted the heavy po­lice pres­ence seen on the is­land since the dev­as­tat­ing fires late on Tues­day and Wed­nes­day turned the sprawl­ing site into a mass of smoul­der­ing metal and melted tents.</p>
    <p>While no­body was se­ri­ously hurt in the fires, the blaze razed the of­fi­cial part of the camp where 4,000 lived, and the other fire on Wed­nes­day wrecked most of the re­main­ing camp where another 8,000 lived in tents and shacks.</p>
    <p>The Greek gov­ern­ment said it had se­cured thou­sands of tents to pro­vide tem­po­rary shel­ter for the mi­grants. A pas­sen­ger ferry docked at the is­land’s port of Myti­lene to help pro­vide as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>But Athens’ plans face stiff re­sis­tance from the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and res­i­dents who fear the tem­po­rary shel­ters will turn into another per­ma­nent mi­grant camp.</p>
    <p>“It is a tragic op­por­tu­nity for mi­grants to leave... Mo­ria is a mon­stros­ity,” Mr Dim­itris Kour­soubas, a se­nior of­fi­cial re­spon­si­ble for mi­gra­tion in the north­ern Aegean is­lands, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“We want all the mi­grants out, for na­tional rea­sons. Mo­ria is over.”</p>
    <p>Is­landers have set up road­blocks near the burnt-out camp to halt at­tempts to clean up the site and re­house the asy­lum seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal at­ti­tudes on an is­land at the fore­front of the Euro­pean mi­grant cri­sis of 2015-2016, though ini­tially wel­com­ing, have turned largely hos­tile as the camp pop­u­la­tion ex­panded. Most of the mi­grants are from Afghanista­n and Syria. Thou­sands slept on road­sides and fields for a sec­ond night on Thurs­day. Oth­ers camped in a ceme­tery.</p>
    <p>Ger­many has used the fire to call for more sol­i­dar­ity in Europe and, along with France, agreed to an ini­tia­tive on Thurs­day for EU states to share out the roughly 400 chil­dren and young peo­ple from the camp.</p>
    <p>The Nether­lands and Fin­land have also of­fered to take in some of the young mi­grants.</p>
    <p>“Mo­ria is here to re­mind us of a Europe we need to change,” Euro­pean Com­mis­sion vice-pres­i­dent Mar­gari­tis Schi­nas, who vis­ited Les­bos, told the Athens New Agency.</p>
    <p>Some Euro­pean Union states, in­clud­ing Hun­gary and Poland, have pre­vi­ously re­fused point-blank to take in any of the mi­grants.</p>
    <p>The Greek gov­ern­ment has said the fires were started by asy­lum seek­ers re­act­ing to quar­an­tine mea­sures af­ter Covid-19 was de­tected in the camp, though it has not pro­vided any ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Thirty-five peo­ple who fled the fires in the early hours of Wed­nes­day had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, fur­ther com­pli­cat­ing ef­forts by the po­lice and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to gather the mi­grants in one place, near the port, and to pro­vide shel­ter.</p>
    <p>The camp was quar­an­tined last week af­ter a 40-year-old man tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. Pre­par­ing for a pos­si­ble surge in cases, the au­thor­i­ties were send­ing 19,000 test kits to the is­land.</p>
    <p>Greece’s con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment has tough­ened its asy­lum restric­tions, slash­ing cash ben­e­fits and ac­com­mo­da­tion pro­vi­sions to dis­cour­age fur­ther mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has also passed a law aim­ing to limit the ac­cess of NGOs and char­i­ties to the camps and to boost of­fi­cial con­trol.</p>
