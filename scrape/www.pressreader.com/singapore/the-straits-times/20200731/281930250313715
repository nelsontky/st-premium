    <p>The evo­lu­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s par­lia­men­tary sys­tem, mov­ing in tan­dem with that of its po­lit­i­cal process, is ap­par­ent in the for­mal ap­point­ment of a Leader of the Op­po­si­tion. Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh will be given the right of first re­sponse among Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment, have more time to speak in the House, and re­ceive con­fi­den­tial brief­ings from the Govern­ment. He also will be paid dou­ble what other MPs earn, and get al­lowances to hire more staff. These are sub­stan­tive of­fi­cial priv­i­leges that re­flect the recog­ni­tion of the op­po­si­tion’s greater pro­file in Par­lia­ment, one that was gained in the last gen­eral elec­tion when the elec­torate also ex­pressed a de­sire for a di­ver­sity of par­lia­men­tary voices. The WP now has 10 MPs, while the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party will have two Non-Con­stituency MPs.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh has said that the broad scope of du­ties, priv­i­leges and re­mu­ner­a­tion he will re­ceive is largely in line with the con­ven­tions of the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment. Sin­ga­pore has mod­i­fied the West­min­ster sys­tem over the years, through schemes such as group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituen­cies and nom­i­nated MPs, to keep Par­lia­ment re­spon­sive to chang­ing na­tional re­al­i­ties. The lat­est change is be­ing made in the same spirit, although it will re­sult in a de­gree of con­ver­gence with the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment, where the role of op­po­si­tion is an en­trenched part of the leg­isla­tive process.</p>
    <p>With power comes re­spon­si­bil­ity. And as it is with the Govern­ment, so too with the op­po­si­tion. Pub­lic ex­pec­ta­tions of the op­po­si­tion and its leader will be higher now, given his greater ac­cess to of­fi­cial in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing some which re­main out­side the pub­lic realm be­cause of its sen­si­tive na­ture. With the ben­e­fit of pol­icy brief­ings, the op­po­si­tion would be ex­pected to come up with ideas and counter-pro­pos­als, at least on the key is­sues and ma­jor po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments of the day. These will have to go be­yond ques­tion­ing or crit­i­cis­ing what the Govern­ment has to of­fer. Na­tional is­sues such as em­ploy­ment, eco­nomic di­rec­tion and pop­u­la­tion would ben­e­fit from the op­po­si­tion’s care­ful thought and anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion par­ties may do this al­ready in posts on their web­sites, pol­icy pa­pers and other forms of pub­lic and so­cial me­dia out­reach. But these need to be sur­faced in Par­lia­ment where their sound­ness and vi­a­bil­ity can be sub­ject to broad scru­tiny and de­bate. The op­po­si­tion must ex­pect its own sug­gested poli­cies to be scru­ti­nised by the Govern­ment. Na­tional is­sues ben­e­fit from in­formed and rea­soned de­bate which goes far be­yond par­ti­san point-scor­ing. That lat­ter ap­proach, alas, was on dis­play in the re­cent elec­tion cam­paign, most no­tably on the thorny is­sues of pop­u­la­tion growth and im­mi­gra­tion. Sin­ga­pore­ans have made clear they want more con­tes­ta­tion in Par­lia­ment, but fo­cused al­ways on the na­tional good, rather than po­lit­i­cal pos­tur­ing.</p>
