    <p>A former part-time In­done­sian law lec­turer ad­mit­ted in a district court here yes­ter­day that he had taken part in an in­surance scam in­volv­ing nearly $500,000, cheat­ing mainly AIA Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Khomaini’s of­fences from 2018 to last year led to over $160,000 in pay­outs and, in sev­eral in­stances, in­volved im­pos­tors pre­tend­ing to be hos­pi­tal pa­tients in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>He also used the names of some of his un­sus­pect­ing fam­ily mem­bers to file false claims. The 40-year-old In­done­sian, who goes by only one name, com­mit­ted the of­fences in his home coun­try and of­fi­cers from Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) ar­rested him on Feb 17 when he came here for a hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>The court was told that Khomaini has a PhD in law from an In­done­sian university.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to three years and two months’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to seven counts of cheat­ing in­volv­ing more than $340,000. Six­teen other sim­i­lar charges linked to the re­main­ing amount were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>He was work­ing as an in­surance agent in In­done­sia from 2015 to 2016 when a col­league taught him how to make bo­gus in­surance claims and earn cash from poli­cies, the court was told.</p>
    <p>The col­league, Ms Nesya My­din, also told him in­surance poli­cies in Sin­ga­pore had better re­turns and lower pre­mi­ums com­pared with those in In­done­sia, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Prose­cu­tor Se­lene Yap said: “As a re­sult, the ac­cused also pur­chased sev­eral in­surance poli­cies in Sin­ga­pore for the pur­pose of sub­mit­ting false in­surance claims.</p>
    <p>“He also pur­chased in­surance poli­cies un­der the names of his fam­ily mem­bers and friends, in­tend­ing to use them for the same pur­pose. The ac­cused paid the... pre­mi­ums for these poli­cies.”</p>
    <p>Ms Nesya in­tro­duced Khomaini to a man known only as Sian­turi, who later acted as a mid­dle­man and made ar­range­ments for him.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2017, Khomaini bought three in­surance poli­cies in his mother’s name. The court heard that his mother, Madam Yus­liyah, was un­aware of her son’s scheme.</p>
    <p>On Oct 16, 2018, AIA Sin­ga­pore re­ceived a claim for Madam Yus­liyah’s pur­ported hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion at an In­done­sian fa­cil­ity for dengue from Aug 17 to 26 that year.</p>
    <p>On the false claim, the DPP said: “The pa­tient treated...was not Yus­liyah but an un­known fe­male sub­ject who was reg­is­tered at the hos­pi­tal us­ing Yus­liyah’s iden­tity. Sian­turi made the ar­range­ments pur­suant to the con­spir­acy.”</p>
    <p>AIA was then duped into pay­ing out more than $20,000. The court heard that Khomaini later used a sim­i­lar method to fraud­u­lently ob­tain more in­surance pay­outs.</p>
