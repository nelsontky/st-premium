    <p>Mr Jaswant Singh Gill, Sin­ga­pore’s first head of navy and a pil­lar of the Sikh com­mu­nity, died last Satur­day, aged 97.</p>
    <p>He was run­ning a fever caused by pneu­mo­nia and was be­ing read­ied to be taken to hos­pi­tal when he died in his home at about 10am.</p>
    <p>He is sur­vived by two sons and four daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Gill came to Sin­ga­pore with his un­cle when he was six, and served in key de­fence po­si­tions in Sin­ga­pore’s fledg­ling years af­ter fight­ing for Sin­ga­pore dur­ing Kon­frontasi, a con­flict be­tween In­done­sia and the then Fed­er­a­tion of Malaysia which took place be­tween 1963 and 1966.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to be­ing com­man­der of the Sin­ga­pore Naval Vol­un­teer Force when the Bri­tish left in 1967, he was the com­mand­ing of­fi­cer of Pu­lau Blakang Mati Camp, head of the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces train­ing depart­ment in the gen­eral staff di­vi­sion and com­man­der of Ten­gah Air Base and Changi Air Base.</p>
    <p>He re­tired from the SAF in 1972 with the rank of lieu­tenant­colonel.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy, in a trib­ute to Mr Gill, said on Face­book on Sun­day that it is deeply in­debted to the com­man­der.</p>
    <p>“Just as our white en­sign con­tin­ues to fly daily, his words will be etched in our minds as we con­tinue with our daily re­solve to bring hon­our and re­spect to our coun­try,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gill spoke at the 1967 cer­e­mony where Sin­ga­pore’s white naval en­sign was hoisted for the first time, a mo­men­tous oc­ca­sion for the then newly in­de­pen­dent na­tion whose fate was yet un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s Early Sikh Pi­o­neers: Ori­gins, Set­tle­ment, Con­tri­bu­tions And In­sti­tu­tions, writ­ten by Mr Rish­pal Singh Sidhu, Mr Gill also earned ku­dos from fel­low Sikhs for not drink­ing de­spite it be­ing the norm in the armed forces.</p>
    <p>“Where im­bib­ing a sun­downer af­ter hours is a norm for most mil­i­tary of­fi­cers, Jaswant Singh Gill has re­mained a tee­to­taller, mak­ing do with a plain soda or ginger ale, thereby earn­ing un­der­stand­ing and re­spect from his fel­low of­fi­cers for his faith,” it said.</p>
    <p>He also made sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tions to the Sikh com­mu­nity, serv­ing as the Sin­ga­pore Khalsa As­so­ci­a­tion’s pres­i­dent from 1966 to 1981. The as­so­ci­a­tion, set up in 1931, ini­tially served as a sports club for the Sikh com­mu­nity, but later evolved into a com­mu­nity space where peo­ple gath­ered for im­por­tant life events, such as wed­dings.</p>
    <p>To­day, the build­ing in Tessen­sohn Road is also widely used by non-Sikh Sin­ga­pore­ans, with ball­rooms and a dance stu­dio avail­able for book­ing by the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Mr Kir­pal Sidhu, 60, Mr Gill’s nephew, said his un­cle was the head of his ex­tended fam­ily and im­bued in the chil­dren early on a sense of dis­ci­pline and ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>“He ran a very tight ship. There are things he made sure we knew he would not tol­er­ate. We all had to know how to speak our mother tongue, Pun­jabi, flu­ently,” he said, adding that they also had to learn how to play in­stru­ments for Sikh mu­sic like the twin drums tabla.</p>
    <p>“It was very painful (for me as a child) but now I am so thank­ful. He is some­one we can em­u­late and we will miss him tremen­dously.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kir­pal said that due to the pan­demic, com­mem­o­ra­tion ser­vices took place via Zoom so Mr Gill’s chil­dren, five of whom are cur­rently not here, could join in.</p>
    <p>“He walked his talk and did not speak in dou­ble lan­guage. He tells you things as they are. We are very proud of his role in Sin­ga­pore’s na­tion-build­ing. We are so proud that he chose to step up,” he added.</p>
