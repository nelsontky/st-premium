    <p>• A US univer­sity has launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter a pro­fes­sor ad­mit­ted she had lied for years about be­ing black and is, in fact, white – a stun­ning ad­mis­sion amid a tense na­tional reck­on­ing on race is­sues in­clud­ing cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In a post on the plat­form Medium, Dr Jessica Krug – a his­tory pro­fes­sor fo­cus­ing on Africa, at Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity in the US cap­i­tal – said she had been pre­tend­ing “for the bet­ter part” of her adult life.</p>
    <p>“I have es­chewed my lived ex­pe­ri­ence as a white Jewish child in sub­ur­ban Kansas City un­der var­i­ous as­sumed iden­ti­ties within a black­ness that I had no right to claim,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Dr Krug, who is light-skinned, said she first claimed “North African black­ness, t hen US­rooted black­ness, then Caribbean-rooted Bronx black­ness”.</p>
    <p>One of her for­mer stu­dents told CNN that Dr Krug voiced pride in her Bronx roots, but told another stu­dent she was from Puerto Rico.</p>
    <p>Dr Krug said on Medium that her ac­tions were the “very epit­ome of vi­o­lence, of thiev­ery and ap­pro­pri­a­tion, of the myr­iad ways in which non-black peo­ple con­tinue to use and abuse black iden­ti­ties and cul­tures”.</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sor called her­self a cul­tural “leech”.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Fri­day evening, the univer­sity said: “While the univer­sity re­views this sit­u­a­tion, Dr Krug will not be teach­ing her classes this se­mes­ter.” It did not say what will now hap­pen with her.</p>
    <p>“We want to ac­knowl­edge the pain this sit­u­a­tion has caused for many i n our com­mu­nity,” it added.</p>
    <p>Dr Krug’s sit­u­a­tion brought to mind the case of con­tro­ver­sial US ac­tivist Rachel Dolezal, who made headlines in 2015 af­ter say­ing she iden­ti­fied as black, even though both of her par­ents are white.</p>
    <p>Cul­tural ap­pro­pri­a­tion has be­come more and more ta­boo in the United States, no­tably in pro­gres­sive and univer­sity com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Pop diva Adele re­cently found her­self in hot wa­ter af­ter post­ing a photo of her­self on In­sta­gram with her hair in Bantu knots, a tra­di­tional African hair­style.</p>
    <p>AS­SUMED VAR­I­OUS IDEN­TI­TIES</p>
    <p>I have es­chewed my lived ex­pe­ri­ence as a white Jewish child in sub­ur­ban Kansas City un­der var­i­ous as­sumed iden­ti­ties within a black­ness that I had no right to claim.</p>
    <p>DR JESSICA KRUG, a his­tory pro­fes­sor at Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity, on ly­ing for years about be­ing black when she is, in fact, white.</p>
