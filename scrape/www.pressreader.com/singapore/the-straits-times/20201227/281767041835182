    <p>For weary Brexit ne­go­tia­tors on both sides of the English Chan­nel, a Christ­mas Eve trade deal sealed 11 months of de­lib­er­a­tions over Britain’s de­par­ture from the Euro­pean Union, en­com­pass­ing de­tails as ar­cane as what species of fish can be caught by each side’s boats in Bri­tish wa­ters.</p>
    <p>But for many oth­ers – among them bankers, traders, truck­ers, ar­chi­tects and mil­lions of mi­grants – Christ­mas was only Day 1 of a high­stakes, un­pre­dictable ex­per­i­ment in how to un­stitch a tight web of com­mer­cial ties across Europe.</p>
    <p>The deal, far from clos­ing the book on Britain’s tu­mul­tuous part­ner­ship with Europe, has opened a new one, be­gin­ning on its first pages with what an­a­lysts say will be the big­gest overnight change in mod­ern com­mer­cial re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>In the four years since Bri­tons voted to cast off a half-cen­tury of ties to Europe, many mi­grants have stopped mov­ing to Britain for work and Bri­tish firms have sent staff to Paris and Frank­furt to set up toe­holds on the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>But for all those prepa­ra­tions, less than a week is now all that stands be­tween busi­nesses and an avalanche of new trad­ing ob­sta­cles on Jan 1.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to have to learn how to do this as we go,” said Mr Shane Bren­nan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Cold Chain Fed­er­a­tion, a Bri­tish group rep­re­sent­ing lo­gis­tics firms. “It will be slow, com­plex and ex­pen­sive.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish dis­trib­u­tors are scram­bling to pre­pare the first of hun­dreds of thou­sands of new ex­port cer­ti­fi­ca­tions to al­low their meat, fish and dairy to be sold to the bloc. Bri­tish food, once ex­empt from such bur­den­some checks, now faces the same in­spec­tions as Euro­pean im­ports from coun­tries like Chile and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Britain’s ser­vices sec­tor – en­com­pass­ing not only Lon­don’s fi­nan­cial in­dus­try but also lawyers, ar­chi­tects, con­sul­tants and oth­ers – was largely left out of the 1,246-page deal, de­spite the sec­tor ac­count­ing for 80 per cent of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The deal also did lit­tle to as­suage Euro­pean mi­grants, some of whom left Britain dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and are now strug­gling to de­ter­mine if they need to rush back to es­tab­lish a right to set­tle in Britain be­fore the split is fi­nalised on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“As of Jan 1... the safety blan­ket of the tran­si­tion pe­riod is gone,” said Ms Maike Bohn, a co-founder of the3mil­lion, which sup­ports Euro­pean cit­i­zens in Britain, lay­ing out her fears that Euro­peans will be un­fairly re­fused jobs and rental apart­ments amid the con­fu­sion.</p>
    <p>SLOW AND EX­PEN­SIVE PROCESS</p>
    <p>We are go­ing to have to learn how to do this as we go. Let’s hope it’s for the better in the end, but it will be slow, com­plex and ex­pen­sive. ’’</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts and or­di­nary cit­i­zens have been left un­cer­tain about de­tails of the trade deal as ne­go­tia­tors did not for­mally pub­lish the text un­til yesterday af­ter­noon. It will take time to work through the vo­lu­mi­nous trade doc­u­ment.</p>
    <p>But it had long been clear that the pact would of­fer the City of Lon­don, a hub for in­ter­na­tional banks, in­sur­ance firms and hedge funds, few as­sur­ances about fu­ture trade across the English Chan­nel.</p>
    <p>The new trade deal does smooth the flow of goods across Bri­tish bor­ders. But it leaves fi­nan­cial firms with­out the big­gest ben­e­fit of EU mem­ber­ship: the abil­ity to eas­ily of­fer ser­vices to clients across the re­gion from a sin­gle base.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of the deal is that the EU “re­tains all of its cur­rent ad­van­tages in trad­ing, par­tic­u­larly with goods, and the UK loses all of its cur­rent ad­van­tages in the trade for ser­vices”, said Mr Tom Kibasi, for­mer di­rec­tor of the In­sti­tute for Pub­lic Pol­icy Re­search.</p>
    <p>“The out­come of this trade ne­go­ti­a­tion is pre­cisely what hap­pens with most trade deals: the larger party gets what it wants and the smaller party rolls over.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ing to let goods cross the bor­der with­out oner­ous tar­iffs en­sured that the most vi­tal sup­plies – food and medicine – were ac­ces­si­ble across Europe. A deal on goods was also eas­ier to strike; given in­tri­cate coun­try-by-coun­try fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tions, like how much money banks must hold, most trade agree­ments skirt the ser­vice in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>But Brexit is not most trade agree­ments: It is erect­ing bar­ri­ers, not tak­ing them down.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Jan 1, the sale of ser­vices, once as­sured, will hang on patch­work de­ci­sions by Euro­pean reg­u­la­tors about whether Britain’s new fi­nan­cial rules are close enough to their own to be trusted.</p>
    <p>As for Bri­tish re­tail­ers, when Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son promised that there would be “no non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers” to sell­ing goods af­ter Brexit, he had ig­nored the tens of mil­lions of Cus­toms dec­la­ra­tions, health as­sess­ments and other checks that busi­nesses will now be re­spon­si­ble for.</p>
    <p>Britain is short of the Cus­toms agents needed to deal with those doc­u­ments, in­dus­try ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mas­sive prob­lem that is go­ing to cost in­dus­try mil­lions of pounds and euros,” said Mr Alex Alt­mann, a part­ner in charge of Brexit-re­lated is­sues at Blick Rothen­berg, an ac­count­ing and tax prac­tice. “That’s go­ing to be passed on to con­sumers.”</p>
    <p>Still, the deal looks cer­tain to be passed when Par­lia­ment is re­called on Wed­nes­day, af­ter Britain’s main op­po­si­tion Labour Party said it would vote in favour de­spite mis­giv­ings.</p>
    <p>“When this deal comes be­fore Par­lia­ment Labour will ac­cept it, and vote for it,” party leader Keir Starmer said, adding that it was a “tough but nec­es­sary de­ci­sion”.</p>
    <p>The votes will take place less than 48 hours be­fore the pact is due to come into ef­fect.</p>
    <p>On the EU side, mem­ber states are ex­pected to give pro­vi­sional ap­proval be­fore the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment can weigh in next month.</p>
    <p>“To­day is a day of relief. But tainted by some sad­ness, as we com­pare what came be­fore with what lies ahead,” EU Brexit ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier said on Thurs­day af­ter the deal was clinched.</p>
    <p>“We have got a good deal to show for it,” Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen said, while French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron lauded “the unity and strength of Europe” for help­ing to se­cure a sat­is­fac­tory deal.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish busi­ness lead­ers were not as sat­is­fied with the out­come.</p>
    <p>“Let’s not for­get that many busi­nesses are al­ready on their knees from the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, and most will have fewer re­sources avail­able to im­ple­ment the nec­es­sary changes with fur­loughed staff and Christ­mas hol­i­days,” said Bri­tish Cham­bers of Com­merce di­rec­tor-gen­eral Adam Mar­shall.</p>
    <p>Mr Ian Wright, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Britain’s Food and Drink Fed­er­a­tion, said: “The Prime Min­is­ter promised UK busi­nesses over a year of tran­si­tion in which to adapt to a new set of rules. He has de­liv­ered us four work­ing days.”</p>
    <p>MR SHANE BREN­NAN, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Cold Chain Fed­er­a­tion, a Bri­tish group rep­re­sent­ing lo­gis­tics firms.</p>
    <p>UN­KNOWN HUR­DLES</p>
    <p>We’ve pre­pared as much as we can. We know about the pa­per­work, we know about the ex­tra cost, we know about the de­lays at the ports, but it’s the things we don’t know about that will prob­a­bly do the most dam­age. ’’</p>
    <p>MR DAVID EXWOOD, whose farm holds 600 cat­tle and 800ha of arable crops.</p>
