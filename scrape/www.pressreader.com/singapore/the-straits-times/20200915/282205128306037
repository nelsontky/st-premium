    <p>ZenRock Com­modi­ties Trad­ing and Agri­trade In­ter­na­tional could be wound up, as their re­spec­tive ju­di­cial man­agers have filed ap­pli­ca­tions to have them liq­ui­dated.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Hon­top En­ergy (Sin­ga­pore) has been placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial man­agers for oil trader ZenRock made the wind­ing-up ap­pli­ca­tion on Aug 25. In July, the debt-laden com­pany was placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>ZenRock’s ju­di­cial man­agers from KPMG had said then that there was value in plac­ing the com­pany un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>They may also con­sider a pro­posed man­age­ment buy­out of a new unit, ZenRock Europe, set up by joint ven­ture part­ner Mark Pa­pallo, who owns 15 per cent of the Geneva-based en­tity.</p>
    <p>ZenRock owes HSBC Bank about US$49 mil­lion (S$67 mil­lion), while its to­tal debt to banks is un­der­stood to be around US$165 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The oil trader is also be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Com­mod­ity trader Agri­trade is fac­ing the same fate, after its ju­di­cial man­agers from Ernst & Young ap­plied early this month to wind it up. Agri­trade is said to owe about US$1.55 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The courts will hear the ap­pli­ca­tion for Agri­trade next Mon­day, and that for ZenRock on Sept 28.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, oil trader Hon­top En­ergy was placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment on Sept 7. It is be­ing taken care of by RSM Cor­po­rate Ad­vi­sory.</p>
