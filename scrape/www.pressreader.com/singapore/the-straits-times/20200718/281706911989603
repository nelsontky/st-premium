    <p>Two of the three new im­ported Covid-19 cases an­nounced yes­ter­day were baby girls, both aged one, who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>One is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder, while the other is a long-term pass holder.</p>
    <p>The first baby ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore on Wed­nes­day and showed symp­toms on Thurs­day, while the sec­ond girl ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore on June 26 and was asymp­to­matic. Both tested pos­i­tive yes­ter­day. The third im­ported pa­tient was a Sin­ga­porean who re­turned from the Philip­pines on July 6.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported pa­tients were placed on a 14-day stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and tested while serv­ing their no­tice.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) also an­nounced Sin­ga­pore’s 15th case of a pa­tient who tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus but died from other causes.</p>
    <p>The 72-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman, who was one of nine new com­mu­nity cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, died on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The woman was taken to the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal’s emer­gency depart­ment that day for rea­sons not re­lated to Covid-19. She had a his­tory of di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>She was con­firmed to be Covid-19 pos­i­tive on Thurs­day af­ter her death. The cause of death was in­trac­ere­bral haem­or­rhage, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The eight other cases in the com­mu­nity com­prise five Sin­ga­pore­ans, two work pass hold­ers and one work per­mit holder. All were linked to pre­vi­ous cases or clus­ters. Of these, four cases were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ously con­firmed cases, and were quar­an­tined ear­lier. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>An­other pa­tient was iden­ti­fied from test­ing in­di­vid­u­als work­ing in front-line Covid-19 op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three com­mu­nity cases were swabbed un­der en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing to test all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion when they first visit a doc­tor.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up 315 of the 327 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day. The new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 47,453.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, depart­ment store BHG’s out­let in Lot One Shop­pers’ Mall, Jem and West­gate were newly added to a list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Re­sorts World Sen­tosa’s casino and Sim Lim Square also had new en­tries on the list, which can be found on MOH’s site.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced a new clus­ter at a con­struc­tion site at Paya Le­bar Quar­ter Tower 2.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week de­creased from 16 cases two weeks ago to 11 in the past week. On Thurs­day, the past week’s fig­ure was 12.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of eight cases to six over the same pe­riod. Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
