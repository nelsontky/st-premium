    <p>New­comer Jo Ellen Pell­man lives out ev­ery as­pir­ing ac­tor’s dream when she stars with screen leg­end Meryl Streep in The Prom, a mu­si­cal com­edy de­but­ing on Net­flix on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Di­rected by Ryan Mur­phy, cre­ator of the tele­vi­sion mu­si­cal Glee (2009 to 2015), the film casts Streep and an­other Oscar win­ner, Ni­cole Kid­man, as Broad­way stars whose lat­est show is a huge flop.</p>
    <p>So they try and re­vive their ca­reers by cham­pi­oning a cause: to con­vince a con­ser­va­tive high school to re­verse its de­ci­sion to bar one of its stu­dents, Emma (Pell­man), from tak­ing her girl­friend Alyssa (Ari­ana DeBose) to the prom.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent Zoom press con­fer­ence, Pell­man, 25, and DeBose, 29, gush about how starstruck they were work­ing with Streep and Kid­man, along with other cast mem­bers such as James Cor­den, Kee­ganMichael Key and Kerry Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>But even though ev­ery­one on set was in awe of her, Streep – the three-time Oscar-win­ning star of films such as The Iron Lady (2011) and Sophie’s Choice (1982) – ac­tu­ally strug­gled to mas­ter the chore­og­ra­phy of the film’s songand-dance num­bers.</p>
    <p>“I’m the old­est per­son in the cast and I have the most danc­ing, which didn’t make sense to me,” the 71-year-old says dryly.</p>
    <p>Streep had seen the 2018 Broad­way mu­si­cal the film is based on, and notes that “the lead­ing lady didn’t do a lot of danc­ing”.</p>
    <p>“Then all hell broke loose when I got to Los An­ge­les and they laid out for me what (the role) was. It was a lot of danc­ing – and so I got in shape.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lot of stamina and, man, it was hard work. But it was re­ally fun,” says The Devil Wears Prada (2006) star.</p>
    <p>Kid­man, too, was ini­tially wor­ried she had bit­ten off more than she could chew.</p>
    <p>“We ac­tu­ally had six weeks re­hearsal – a long time,” says the 53-year-old, who won an Oscar for the drama The Hours (2002).</p>
    <p>“It was ter­ri­fy­ing be­cause the (Bob) Fosse-style danc­ing I was do­ing is so spe­cific. But I had this amaz­ing group of dancers that trained me with the pa­tience of saints and, ac­tu­ally, it was re­ally fun.”</p>
    <p>And de­spite the rel­a­tive in­ex­pe­ri­ence of her younger co-stars, Kid­man praises Pell­man and DeBose for “tak­ing a huge bite out of the screen”. “They came on set and, as much as they were like, ‘Oh, my gosh’ at all of us, they just stepped in and owned it from the word go. I was so in­tim­i­dated when I watched them sing and dance,” she ad­mits.</p>
    <p>“I was, like, ‘Help me, girls – help me,’” she quips.</p>
    <p>But even for a sea­soned per­former such as Key, it was daunt­ing do­ing scenes with Streep – es­pe­cially given that he plays a teacher at the high school who be­comes ro­man­ti­cally in­volved with her char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>How ner­vous was he the day he had to film a kiss­ing scene with the ven­er­ated ac­tress?</p>
    <p>“I was ner­vous with an­tic­i­pa­tion and hap­pi­ness,” says the 49-yearold, who cre­ated the com­edy sketch se­ries Key & Peele (2012 to 2015) and voiced a char­ac­ter in the an­i­mated hit The Lion King (2019).</p>
    <p>“When you’re in the­atre school and 22 years old, if your fu­ture self came back and said, ‘I just want you to know that in 2020, you’re go­ing to be kiss­ing Meryl Streep in a movie’, you’d be, like, ‘Get out of here, ly­ing de­mon – you’re not real’.”</p>
    <p>For Mur­phy, writ­ing and pro­duc­ing The Prom was a pas­sion project.</p>
    <p>In the stage pro­duc­tion, “the heroine is from In­di­ana and is de­nied go­ing to her prom, and half­way through the mu­si­cal, I re­alised that was my ex­pe­ri­ence: I’m from In­di­ana and I was not al­lowed to go to my prom”, says the 55-year-old, who won an Emmy for di­rect­ing the drama se­ries The As­sas­si­na­tion Of Gianni Ver­sace: Amer­i­can Crime Story (2018).</p>
    <p>“So it be­came a very per­sonal thing for me.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “We’re ex­cited for peo­ple to see it be­cause I think we need the mes­sage of the movie right now – the joy of it and the es­capism.”</p>
