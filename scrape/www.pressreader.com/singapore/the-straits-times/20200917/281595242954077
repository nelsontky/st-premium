    <p>Not ev­ery­one who un­der­goes to­tal knee re­place­ment surgery has a happy out­come. The win­ners of Sin­ga­pore’s James Dyson Award this year came up with a wear­able de­vice that is at­tached to the knee, and gives feed­back to phys­io­ther­a­pists on whether pa­tients are do­ing the pre­scribed ex­er­cises reg­u­larly and cor­rectly.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 20,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans un­dergo to­tal knee re­place­ment surgery ev­ery year and the ma­jor­ity re­gain their mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one has a happy out­come. An es­ti­mated one in five never re­gains full move­ment. Some de­velop other com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Often, the prob­lem is that to get back on their feet – lit­er­ally – pa­tients have to ex­er­cise on their own at home as part of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, and the out­comes are not al­ways ideal.</p>
    <p>The win­ners of Sin­ga­pore’s James Dyson Award this year, Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) grad­u­ates Aaron Ramzeen, 26, and Ricky Guo, 30, de­cided to use their knowl­edge of engi­neer­ing and science to help pa­tients who have un­der­gone knee re­place­ment surgery.</p>
    <p>They came up with Kimia, a wear­able de­vice that is at­tached to the knee, and gives feed­back to phys­io­ther­a­pists on whether pa­tients are do­ing the pre­scribed ex­er­cises reg­u­larly and cor­rectly.</p>
    <p>There are other ex­ist­ing wear­ables in the mar­ket to track a pa­tient while ex­er­cis­ing, but their data is often un­re­li­able, said Mr Ramzeen and Mr Guo.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Kimia, which is un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal tri­als in three pub­lic hos­pi­tals here, has been found to col­lect highly ac­cu­rate data that clin­i­cians can rely on to track their pa­tients’ progress.</p>
    <p>The de­vice, which is built for con­tin­u­ous 24/7 mon­i­tor­ing, can be com­fort­ably worn whether the user is walk­ing, sit­ting or sleep­ing, said the in­ven­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­hishek Agrawal, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Kinexcs, the start-up com­pany that will mar­ket the invention, is look­ing at adapt­ing the de­vice for use on other parts of the body, such as the hips, an­kles and shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>Mr Ramzeen, an engi­neer­ing grad­u­ate, and Mr Guo, who has two de­grees from NUS, said they are look­ing into de­vel­op­ing more med­i­cal wear­able prod­ucts for the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Both said they are de­lighted with be­ing named the na­tional win­ners, but are now look­ing for the big­ger</p>
    <p>prize, of mak­ing it to the in­ter­na­tional top 20 short­list.</p>
    <p>In­ven­tor and en­tre­pre­neur James Dyson will pick an in­ter­na­tional win­ner and two run­ners-up. He will</p>
    <p>also choose a sus­tain­abil­ity win­ner.</p>
    <p>One in five past in­ter­na­tional win­ners has gone on to suc­cess­fully com­mer­cialise their in­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>In a video in­ter­view with The</p>
    <p>Straits Times, Mr Dyson said that if de­vel­oped well, there is a huge in­ter­na­tional mar­ket for Kimia as any­one with knee prob­lems would find the de­vice use­ful.</p>
    <p>He is also im­pressed with young peo­ple’s zeal to help the less for­tu­nate in so­ci­ety and their con­cern for the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>He men­tioned last year’s in­ter­na­tional win­ner, Bri­ton Lucy Hughes, who re­ceived £30,000 (S$52,800) in prize money and gained an in­ter­na­tional me­dia plat­form that has al­lowed her to pur­sue her invention, Mari­naTex – a bio­plas­tic made from fish waste – full time.</p>
    <p>Mr Dyson said the award, which was started 15 years ago to en­cour­age stu­dents to use their engi­neer­ing and de­sign skills to solve prob­lems, has in­flu­enced engi­neer­ing schools in Bri­tain to in­clude de­sign think­ing in train­ing en­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>Dyson Sin­ga­pore to­day also an­nounced the two run­ners-up en­tries in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One is As­cend, an af­ford­able ac­ces­sory that can be retro­fit­ted onto ex­ist­ing man­ual wheel­chairs to make it eas­ier for them to be wheeled up ramps. It was in­vented by Mr Kong Shao Ming from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond run­ner-up is Lit­tleDreamer – a mask in­vented by a group of engi­neer­ing and med­i­cal stu­dents from NUS to help chil­dren suf­fer­ing from ob­struc­tive sleep ap­noea.</p>
    <p>Un­like other com­pe­ti­tions, par­tic­i­pants are given full au­ton­omy over their in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
