    <p>• Ed­die Van Halen, the gui­tar vir­tu­oso whose group is con­sid­ered one of the great­est rock bands of all time, died on Tues­day fol­low­ing a long bat­tle with can­cer, his son an­nounced.</p>
    <p>“I can’t be­lieve I’m hav­ing to write this, but my father, Ed­ward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and ar­du­ous bat­tle with can­cer this morn­ing,” Wolf Van Halen wrote in a mes­sage on Twit­ter with a pic­ture of the rocker who was 65.</p>
    <p>“He was the best father I could ever ask for,” he added. “Ev­ery moment I’ve shared with him on and off stage was a gift. My heart is bro­ken and I don’t think I’ll ever fully re­cover from this loss. I love you so much, Pop.”</p>
    <p>Born i n the Nether­lands and raised i n Cal­i­for­nia, Van Halen founded the rock group with his older brother Alex in the early 1970s and quickly earned a fan base.</p>
    <p>He was fa­mous for what be­came known as “fin­ger tap­ping” – play­ing the gui­tar with two hands, like a pi­ano. He was also known for his gui­tars, in­clud­ing one named Franken­stein which he pieced to­gether from parts of other in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>Among the group’s clas­sics are Jump, Panama, Run­nin’ With The Devil and the gui­tar solo Erup­tion.</p>
    <p>“Ed’s a once- or twice-in-a-cen­tury kind of guy. There’s Hen­drix and there’s Ed­die Van Halen,” friend and gui­tarist Jerry Cantrell of Alice In Chains said dur­ing Grammy week­end in Jan­uary last year. “Those two guys tilted the world on its axis.”</p>
    <p>Van Halen has sold more than 75 mil­lion al­bums and has more num­ber one hits on the main­stream United States rock chart than any other artist, ac­cord­ing to the band’s la­bel. The group’s album 1984 was to be the band’s high point, giv­ing them their only No. 1 sin­gle Jump.</p>
    <p>The cre­ative ten­sion within the band boiled over dur­ing the 1984 tour, with Ed­die Van Halen and orig­i­nal front­man David Lee Roth fall­ing out. Roth left the band in April 1985. One of his gripes with Ed­die Van Halen was re­port­edly the rocker’s out­side work that in­cluded pro­vid­ing the l ead-in gui­tar for Michael Jack­son’s 1983 smash hit Beat It.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Van Halen had a re­union tour in 2007-2008 with Roth per­form­ing with the group for the first time in 22 years. An­other tour planned in 2012 had to be can­celled af­ter Ed­die Van Halen had to un­dergo emer­gency surgery. But the band re­united again in 2015 for</p>
    <p>an ex­ten­sive North Amer­i­can tour.</p>
    <p>Ed­die Van Halen was known to have health prob­lems that would in­ter­fere with his work for years. He un­der­went hip surgery in 1999 and had part of his tongue re­moved in 2000 af­ter be­ing di­ag­nosed with can­cer, likely be­cause of heavy smok­ing. Al­though he was de­clared can­cer free fol­low­ing the surgery, the Amer­i­can tabloid news site TMZ re­ported ear­lier this year that he had been go­ing to Ger­many for throat can­cer treat­ment.</p>
    <p>His drug abuse and heavy drink­ing con­trib­uted to his 2007 di­vorce from tele­vi­sion ac­tress Va­lerie Bertinelli af­ter 16 years of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>“I was an al­co­holic and I needed al­co­hol to func­tion,” he said in a 2015 in­ter­view with Bill­board mag­a­zine. “I didn’t drink to party. Al­co­hol and co­caine were pri­vate things to me. I would use them for work. The blow keeps you awake and the al­co­hol low­ers your in­hi­bi­tions. I’m sure there were mu­si­cal things I would not have at­tempted were I not in that men­tal state.”</p>
    <p>Trib­utes from some of the big­gest names in the mu­sic world poured in on Tues­day fol­low­ing news of his death. “I’m just dev­as­tated to hear the news of the pass­ing of my dear friend Ed­die Van Halen. He fought a long and hard bat­tle with his can­cer right to the very end. Ed­die was one of a very spe­cial kind of per­son, a re­ally great friend. Rest In Peace my dear friend till we meet again,” Black Sab­bath’s Tony Iommi tweeted.</p>
    <p>“Sad to hear Ed­die Van Halen has passed away. A gui­tar in­no­va­tor with a fierce spirit of mu­si­cal and tech­ni­cal ex­plo­ration. Prayers and thoughts with his fam­ily and friends,” Yusuf/Cat Stevens tweeted.</p>
    <p>Song­writer Diane War­ren said in a tweet that “gui­tars are gen­tly weep­ing ev­ery­where. Shred In Power Ed­die Van Halen”.</p>
    <p>The rocker is sur­vived by his sec­ond wife Janie Liszewski and his son, as well as his first wife Bertinelli.</p>
