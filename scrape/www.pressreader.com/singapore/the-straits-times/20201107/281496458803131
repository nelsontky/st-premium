    <p>As Gent­ing Cruise Lines pre­pared to launch Sin­ga­pore’s first pan­demic cruise to nowhere last night, the com­pany sig­nalled con­fi­dence that this will be a safe voy­age on its World Dream mega ship for the first 1,400 pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Goh, head of in­ter­na­tional sales at Gent­ing Cruise Lines and pres­i­dent of Dream Cruises, high­lighted a safety regime that in­cludes a new re­al­time poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) ma­chine on board that yields Covid-19 test re­sults in 60 min­utes while be­ing able to rule out 22 other res­pi­ra­tory viruses such as H1N1 and in­fluenza. PCR tests are the most ac­cu­rate ones for Covid-19 avail­able.</p>
    <p>Be­fore board­ing, all pas­sen­gers from age 13 are tested for Covid-19. An on-site test­ing fa­cil­ity set up on the third level of the carpark of Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre can clear 125 peo­ple ev­ery 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>There are pro­to­cols to turn the 19-deck ship around in an out­break. Sail­ing in the Strait of Malacca and South China Sea, the World Dream can re­turn to Sin­ga­pore shores in less than six hours, Mr Goh said.</p>
    <p>Seven iso­la­tion cabins for sus­pected cases and 34 quar­an­tine rooms for their close con­tacts have been con­fig­ured, apart from the ex­ist­ing in­ten­sive care unit ward equipped with a ven­ti­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery pas­sen­ger gets a Mice pod for con­tact trac­ing; the to­ken also alerts pas­sen­gers when they are clus­tered too closely.</p>
    <p>Ca­pac­ity has been halved to 1,700. The pas­sen­ger count of 1,400 is be­low that new limit.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia on board the Ger­man-built ship that be­gan its home port de­but in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, Mr Goh said that with 27 years of in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence, the cruise line could swiftly roll out “new health and safety stan</p>
    <p>dards not just for our fleet but also for the in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>The new mea­sures add up to com­pris­ing at least 40 per cent of op­er­a­tional costs, he added. Re­gional cruis­ing could be next af­ter cruises to nowhere, he said.</p>
    <p>Mrs An­nie Chang, di­rec­tor of cruise at the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), said Sin­ga­pore is adopt­ing a grad­ual and phased ap­proach to re­sume cruis­ing safely.</p>
    <p>She said: “The fact that we are on board the World Dream to­day is tes­ta­ment to the re­silience and in­no­va­tive spirit of the cruise in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>She added that it had been a dif­fi­cult year but cruise com­pa­nies have taken the past few months to “re­fine and rein­vent” the cruise ex­pe­ri­ence to fo­cus on safety – with­out com­pro­mis­ing the com­fort and qual­ity that cruises are fa­mous for.</p>
    <p>Among the life­style ex­pe­ri­ences are more than 35 din­ing and bar con­cepts, six wa­ter slides and a laser show.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude yoga, rock­climb­ing, vir­tual re­al­ity games and learn­ing how to mix cock­tails.</p>
    <p>The World Dream will be­gin Christ­mas early. Guests, safely dis­tanced, can en­joy the ac­ro­batic Verry Christ­mas show in a theatre.</p>
    <p>In March, Sin­ga­pore ceased port calls for cruise ships but the Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre was abuzz yes­ter­day with the first wave of in­vited guests who started check­ing in around 8.30am for their two-night Su­per Sea­ca­tion voy­age. Three-night cruises are also sched­uled and World Dream will have up to three sail­ings a week.</p>
    <p>The com­pany let other pas­sen­gers check in from 2pm on­wards to max­imise the cruise ex­pe­ri­ence ahead of the 9pm sail­ing. Pre-pan</p>
    <p>demic check-in was around 6pm.</p>
    <p>Other safety mea­sures in­clude hav­ing fresh air fil­tered and supplied to each guest and crew cabin.</p>
    <p>Self-ser­vice buf­fets have been sus­pended, and guests will be seated in groups no big­ger than five. Restau­rants and bars are cleaned and sani­tised three times daily.</p>
    <p>Next month, Royal Caribbean’s Quan­tum of the Seas will be the sec­ond ship to start cruises to nowhere. From Dec 1, the ship will have up to two sail­ings a week.</p>
    <p>To­gether, the two ships’ sail­ings will rep­re­sent only about 30 per cent of the usual win­ter cruis­ing sea­son, said STB.</p>
    <p>The two com­pa­nies are part of a “safe cruise” pi­lot that caters to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents at a re­duced ca­pac­ity of 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>STB said the Gov­ern­ment will mon­i­tor the out­comes of the pi­lot care­fully in the com­ing months be­fore de­cid­ing on the next steps for cruise re­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Im­mi­gra­tion and</p>
    <p>Check­points Au­thor­ity rolled out iris and fa­cial bio­met­rics on a large scale at the cruise cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Among the ex­cited pas­sen­gers at Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre for yes­ter­day’s sail­ing was Mr Steve Chong and his wife, who were in the queue with their two chil­dren, aged four and six.</p>
    <p>Mr and Mrs Chong, who were given as­signed time slots for board­ing, were over­joyed that their get­away was fi­nally hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old, who works in the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try, and his wife, who works as a tu­tor and is also in her 30s, boarded the World Dream cruise liner at around 4pm.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily paid over $1,400. “This is the first time we’re able to travel since the pan­demic be­gan. The kids and my wife all want a short break,” Mr Chong said.</p>
