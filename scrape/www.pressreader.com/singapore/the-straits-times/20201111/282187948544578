    <p>Banks, in­sur­ers and other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions may have to im­ple­ment more strin­gent ways of ver­i­fy­ing cus­tomers’ iden­tity in non-face-to-face sit­u­a­tions such as phone or on­line bank­ing.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) yes­ter­day is­sued a con­sul­ta­tion pa­per on the types of in­for­ma­tion re­quired for such ver­i­fi­ca­tion. The pro­posed re­quire­ments come against the back­drop of ris­ing im­per­son­ation scam cases, and seek to ad­dress risks aris­ing from theft and mis­use of a per­son’s per­sonal par­tic­u­lars, MAS said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­posed no­tice, it would be manda­tory for a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, such as a bank, to use at least one of the fol­low­ing types of in­for­ma­tion for non-face-to-face ver­i­fi­ca­tion through chan­nels such as phone or on­line bank­ing:</p>
    <p>• A pass­word or PIN</p>
    <p>• A one-time pass­word gen­er­ated through a hard­ware or soft­ware to­ken</p>
    <p>• Bio­met­ric in­for­ma­tion</p>
    <p>which uniquely iden­ti­fies</p>
    <p>the in­di­vid­ual</p>
    <p>• In­for­ma­tion that is known only be­tween the in­di­vid­ual and the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, such as ac­count trans­ac­tion de­tails</p>
    <p>These would be re­quired be­fore any trans­ac­tions or re­quests from the client is un­der­taken, MAS said.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions would also be pro­hib­ited from re­ly­ing on com­mon per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, such as NRIC num­ber, res­i­den­tial ad­dress and date of birth, as the sole means of iden­tity ver­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures would strengthen the au­then­ti­ca­tion con­trols im­ple­mented by fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, MAS said.</p>
    <p>MAS chief cy­ber se­cu­rity of­fi­cer Tan Yeow Seng said per­sonal in­for­ma­tion like NRIC num­ber is of­ten pro­vided by the pub­lic for var­i­ous pur­poses, such as fill­ing in ap­pli­ca­tion forms. Such in­for­ma­tion could be used for im­per­son­ation fraud.</p>
    <p>“The pro­posed no­tice will fur­ther bol­ster con­sumer con­fi­dence in fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions by mak­ing these iden­tity ver­i­fi­ca­tion prac­tices compulsory dur­ing non-faceto-face fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions,” Mr Tan said, adding that con­sumers should also play their part by not dis­clos­ing their on­line bank­ing lo­gin cre­den­tials to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>MAS is sug­gest­ing that these new re­quire­ments would take ef­fect six months af­ter the no­tice is is­sued, and is seek­ing com­ments on whether this tran­si­tion pe­riod would be suf­fi­cient for fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to com­ply. The con­sul­ta­tion pa­per is avail­able on the MAS web­site and in­ter­ested par­ties can sub­mit their com­ments by Dec 9.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, MAS’ Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Ad­vi­sory Panel has rec­om­mended fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to re­view their risk pro­files and ad­e­quacy of risk mit­i­gat­ing mea­sures to main­tain over­sight of third-party ven­dors.</p>
    <p>These rec­om­men­da­tions were pre­sented at an MAS man­age­ment meet­ing last Thurs­day. While Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial sec­tor has done well so far in its cy­ber and op­er­a­tional re­silience, it can­not rest on its lau­rels, MAS manag­ing direc­tor Ravi Menon said. “Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions must re­main alert and nim­ble and strengthen their de­fences against emerg­ing cy­ber threats,” he said.</p>
