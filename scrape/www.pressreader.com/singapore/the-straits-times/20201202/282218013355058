    <p>The courts of Sin­ga­pore and China have jointly pub­lished a col­lec­tion of in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial cases from both coun­tries, as a sym­bol of their com­mit­ment to pur­sue mu­tual un­der­stand­ing of each other’s laws and le­gal sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The book was launched by Sin­ga­pore’s Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Zhou Qiang on Mon­day at the fourth Sin­ga­pore-China Le­gal and Ju­di­cial Round­table, held via video­con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion of cases, which are rel­e­vant to China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, was the cul­mi­na­tion of the ef­forts by a panel of edi­tors and ex­pert com­men­ta­tors from Sin­ga­pore and China, said a state­ment from Sin­ga­pore’s Supreme Court. There are plans to make the book avail­able in the pub­lic do­main as an in­tro­duc­tion to the com­mon­al­i­ties be­tween the com­mer­cial laws of both na­tions.</p>
    <p>The round­table, an an­nual event that started in 2017, was held in a vir­tual for­mat for the first time this year.</p>
    <p>In the midst of the chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances brought about by the global pan­demic, the two courts re­newed their com­mit­ment to work to­gether to ad­vance ac­cess to jus­tice in their re­spec­tive ju­ris­dic­tions, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The two chief jus­tices had a frank and con­struc­tive dis­cus­sion to deepen ex­ist­ing joint ini­tia­tives and ex­plore new co­op­er­a­tion in ar­eas of mu­tual in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Judges from Sin­ga­pore and China also ex­changed in­sights in ar­eas in­clud­ing the chal­lenges posed to the courts and the pro­fes­sion brought by Covid-19, and the ap­pli­ca­tion and lim­i­ta­tion of gen­eral le­gal prin­ci­ples in in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial dis­putes.</p>
