    <p>COPENHAGEN • Den­mark is Europe’s largest ex­porter of mink pelts.</p>
    <p>Here are some key facts about the in­dus­try in Den­mark and else­where in Europe:</p>
    <p>• The Nether­lands, an­other ma­jor Euro­pean Union ex­porter, ac­cel­er­ated a plan to phase out mink farm­ing af­ter two hu­mans were in­fected with Covid-19 dur­ing the first coro­n­avirus wave in May.</p>
    <p>More than 100 Dutch pro­duc­ers – with around 800,000 mother an­i­mals – have been or­dered to close three years early by March next year, at a cost of €180 mil­lion (S$288 mil­lion) to the Dutch gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has been found at 69 Dutch mink farms.</p>
    <p>Dutch health ex­perts are still work­ing to de­ter­mine to what ex­tent the farms are a source of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>• France, which ex­ported roughly €120 mil­lion worth of fur last year, has de­cided to out­law mink farm­ing from 2025.</p>
    <p>• The au­thor­i­ties in Den­mark said five cases of the new virus strain had been recorded on mink farms and 12 cases in hu­mans, who are be­lieved to have caught the ill­ness from an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>• Spain culled 93,000 an­i­mals at a farm in the Aragon re­gion in July af­ter an out­break there.</p>
    <p>• The Euro­pean Union is one of the world’s main sources of fur cloth­ing, led by Den­mark, Fin­land, Italy, Poland, Greece and the Nether­lands. Ex­ports are worth hun­dreds of mil­lions of eu­ros an­nu­ally, ac­cord­ing to the UN Com­trade data­base.</p>
    <p>• An­i­mal rights group Hu­mane So­ci­ety In­ter­na­tional – United King­dom said China, Den­mark and Poland are the largest mink pro­duc­ers glob­ally, with 60 mil­lion minks killed an­nu­ally for their fur.</p>
