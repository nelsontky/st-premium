    <p>“We are us­ing an of­fi­cial ve­hi­cle,” the Thai im­mi­gra­tion po­lice of­fi­cer de­clared as we started to­wards the moun­tains com­monly tra­versed by Myan­mar na­tion­als try­ing to en­ter Thai­land.</p>
    <p>This is not the nor­mal prac­tice, I am told. Here, in Kan­chanaburi prov­ince by Thai­land’s rugged western border, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers keep tabs on il­le­gal en­try us­ing un­marked ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>But tak­ing a re­porter on such a covert pa­trol would blow their cover – some­thing es­pe­cially cru­cial now as Thai­land, which has out­per­formed much of the world in the fight against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, con­tin­ues to ban en­try via its land border to stave off a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>That was how our con­spic­u­ous black po­lice truck ended up grunt­ing along a muddy trail at the foot of the Te­nasserim moun­tain range called Tanao Si by lo­cals ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>We stopped at a small clear­ing also used by lo­cals on their way to a nearby wa­ter­fall. The laugh­ter of the bathers echoed through the steamy jun­gle.</p>
    <p>But when all is silent, the val­ley comes alive with a rather more il­licit ac­tiv­ity. “(The mi­grants) come at night, when no one is around. They are led by smug­glers,” said one of­fi­cer who de­clined to be named be­cause he was not au­tho­rised to speak to the press.</p>
    <p>A trek across the ridge here takes around six gru­elling hours. “Some­times, they ar­rive so hun­gry we have to buy rice for them af­ter their ar­rest,” the of­fi­cer said.</p>
    <p>Asean’s sec­ond largest econ­omy stands at a cross­roads af­ter go­ing for some three months with­out de­tect­ing any lo­cal Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, be­fore large-scale com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions sur­faced, Thai­land of­fi­cially hosted 2.9 mil­lion mi­grant work­ers, mostly from neigh­bour­ing Myan­mar, Laos and Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>But about 500,000 left the coun­try over the sub­se­quent five months as lock­downs forced busi­nesses to lay off work­ers, ac­cord­ing to data from Thai­land’s Min­istry of Labour. More un­doc­u­mented work­ers left via in­for­mal chan­nels.</p>
    <p>These work­ers are now stranded in their coun­tries, un­able to re­turn to Thai­land as it restarts its econ­omy un­der tighter border con­trol.</p>
    <p>Bangkok, which has closed its land border check­points since March, has not in­di­cated when it will al­low work­ers to re­turn, even though it plans to quar­an­tine them for 14 days. A re­newed out­break in Myan­mar is mak­ing the Thai au­thor­i­ties ner­vous.</p>
    <p>“Mi­grant work­ers from neigh­bour­ing coun­tries are not al­lowed to come back yet,” Mr Am­nat Sangsrikae­w, a labour spe­cial­ist at the Min­istry of Labour, told The Straits Times. “We have not worked out the pro­ce­dure.”</p>
    <p>But the growing short­age of labour­ers is crimp­ing busi­ness re­cov­ery, say Thai en­trepreneur­s. And mi­grants who left the coun­try amid the pan­demic and are now un­der fi­nan­cial strain are sneak­ing back.</p>
    <p>IL­LE­GAL EN­TRY ON THE RISE</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ar­rests in Kan­chanaburi sug­gests peo­ple smug­gling is on the rise. From late March to May, the au­thor­i­ties here recorded zero cases of il­le­gal en­try as the pan­demic kept ev­ery­one on edge and put peo­ple off trav­el­ling, said Po­lice Colonel Sam­ran Klanma, who heads Kan­chanaburi’s im­mi­gra­tion bureau.</p>
    <p>In June and last month, how­ever, 172 il­le­gal en­trants were nabbed in the prov­ince alone – al­ready three­quar­ters of the fig­ure logged in the six months lead­ing up to March 22.</p>
    <p>“Most of them want to re­turn to their old jobs in Thai­land,” Col Sam­ran told ST.</p>
    <p>Last month, 59 Cam­bo­di­ans were de­tained by the army in Thai­land’s eastern border prov­ince of Sa Kaeo, af­ter hav­ing each paid a 3,000 baht (S$130) fee to a gang to take them far­ther in­land to find work, the Bangkok Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>In Kan­chanaburi, 35 mi­grants from Myan­mar were ar­rested at a check­point early last Friday.</p>
    <p>Last month, de­fence vol­un­teers pos­ing as fish­er­men there ar­rested 18 Myan­mar na­tion­als, who had hoped to find work in Bangkok or nearby prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Far­ther south, in Prachuap Khiri Khan prov­ince, an­other six Myan­mar na­tion­als who had paid a Thai bro­ker 6,500 baht each for safe pas­sage were found by a team com­pris­ing border pa­trol po­lice, sol­diers and im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Those ar­rested usu­ally un­dergo a two-month-long le­gal and health screen­ing process be­fore be­ing de­ported, said Col Sam­ran.</p>
    <p>Still, some take the risk. In Sangkhlabu­ri dis­trict, home to the erst­while bustling Thai-Myan­mar check­point called Three Pagoda Pass, ST en­coun­tered two Myan­mar women on their way to a rub­ber plan­ta­tion in Su­rat Thani prov­ince. They had en­tered Thai­land with the help of bro­kers and evaded the manda­tory quar­an­tine that ap­plies to all ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>The rub­ber tap­pers blended in eas­ily with the res­i­dents, many of whom were ei­ther born in Myan­mar or to par­ents from Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>A bro­ker who called him­self Nai Win said only the strong­est or most fi­nan­cially des­per­ate work­ers now risk the jour­ney back into Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore the pan­demic, peo­ple used in­for­mal routes even to visit their rel­a­tives in Thai­land,” he said. “Now, only those who re­ally need to come, try. Older peo­ple and preg­nant women stay away, be­cause the only routes pos­si­ble go through the moun­tains.”</p>
    <p>He used to run a brisk trade fer­ry­ing Myan­mar work­ers from Three Pagoda Pass to Bangkok and be­yond. He has since given up be­cause the se­cu­rity checks along the way are too oner­ous.</p>
    <p>Across the border in Myan­mar, which is now bat­tling a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, many lowwage labour­ers are get­ting rest­less. As of yes­ter­day morn­ing, the coun­try has recorded 749 cases, with six deaths. A stay-home or­der is now in ef­fect in the en­tire Rakhine state.</p>
    <p>Mr Nai Sauk worked for over 10 years as a rub­ber tap­per in Thai­land’s Cha­cho­engsao and Chumpon prov­inces be­fore re­turn­ing home in March to build a house. Shortly af­ter, Thai­land shut its border gates.</p>
    <p>As the re­gion hun­kered down, he started tap­ping rub­ber on his small rub­ber plot at home in Mon state to get by. He makes 10,000 kyat (S$10) a day – just enough for food, but not much else.</p>
    <p>He doubts he can re­turn to Thai­land legally even if border gates re­open. The Thai govern­ment wants for­eign work­ers to pos­sess a fit-to­travel cer­tifi­cate be­fore en­ter­ing Thai­land, and to be placed un­der a 14-day quar­an­tine upon en­try.</p>
    <p>This re­quires a Covid-19 test in Myan­mar cost­ing 200,000 kyat. Quar­an­tine ex­penses in Thai­land, mean­while, could be up­wards of 14,000 baht – a sum which Mr Nai Sauk ex­pects em­ploy­ers to claw back from work­ers, even if the firms foot the bill up­front.</p>
    <p>“No mi­grant can pay so much money,” he said. If the Thai and Myan­mar gov­ern­ments do not step in to help, “all mi­grants will have to smug­gle them­selves back into Thai­land”.</p>
    <p>Mr Adis­orn Kerd­mongkol, the Thai­land-based man­ager of civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tion Mi­grant Work­ing Group, wor­ries about the ad­di­tional debt that work­ers will take on just to pay for their quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t do any­thing, this will re­sult in hu­man traf­fick­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>SHORT­AGE OF LABOUR­ERS</p>
    <p>As a stop-gap mea­sure, the Thai govern­ment has al­lowed ex­ist­ing mi­grant work­ers within Thai­land to re­new their work per­mits with­out trav­el­ling home to do so.</p>
    <p>But em­ploy­ers say this is not enough. Ms Nilubon Phong­phay­orm, for ex­am­ple, owns a cor­ru­gated box fac­tory in Bangkok that used to hire 17 for­eign work­ers, of whom all but three went home in March. Now, with most of the do­mes­tic Covid-19 re­stric­tions lifted and busi­ness or­ders re­turn­ing, she can ful­fil only 70 per cent to 80 per cent of the de­mand.</p>
    <p>“Even though the econ­omy is re­turn­ing to nor­mal, we sim­ply don’t have enough work­ers,” she said.</p>
    <p>The same predica­ment is be­ing faced by many in the 20,000-mem­ber Group of En­trepreneur­s With For­eign Work­ers co-founded by Ms Nilubon.</p>
    <p>She is will­ing to pay for work­ers’ quar­an­tine if it is charged at cost price. “But if it’s more than dou­ble, it’s not okay. Em­ploy­ers will not pay,” she said. “Af­ter I have pro­duced this much, I will not take any more or­ders. Ev­ery­thing, the econ­omy, will just stall.”</p>
    <p>Such a pro­duc­tion crunch could be a dou­ble whammy for a touris­mde­pen­dent econ­omy cur­rently squeezed by a Covid-19 con­tain­ment pol­icy that will likely keep most vis­i­tors away un­til next year.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s econ­omy, pro­jected by its cen­tral bank to shrink 8.1 per cent this year, has the worst out­look in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, the Cabi­net tried to give strug­gling small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) a lift by ap­prov­ing soft loans worth 114 bil­lion baht. But busi­ness own­ers say the money would be of lit­tle help if they can­not hire the help they need.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, SMEs are the ones hurt­ing the most from the for­eign labour crunch, said Mr Bhumi Nual­jan, gen­eral man­ager of a work per­mit pro­cess­ing firm.</p>
    <p>“If the govern­ment main­tains a strict quar­an­tine to keep the num­ber of new in­fec­tions at zero, it’s go­ing to ham­per busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It needs to make trade-offs be­tween the threat to pub­lic health and the threat to our econ­omy.”</p>
