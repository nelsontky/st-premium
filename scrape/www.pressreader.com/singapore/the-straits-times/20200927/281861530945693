    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has se­lected Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett, the favourite can­di­date of con­ser­va­tives, to suc­ceed Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg and will try to force Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion, in a move that would sig­nif­i­cantly al­ter the ide­o­log­i­cal makeup of the Supreme Court for years.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was due to an­nounce his choice yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to six peo­ple close to the process who asked not to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>They said Mr Trump is not known to have in­ter­viewed any other can­di­dates and came away from two days of meet­ings with Judge Bar­rett last week im­pressed with a ju­rist he was told would be a fe­male An­tonin Scalia, re­fer­ring to the jus­tice she once clerked for.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t said it was her, but she is out­stand­ing,” Mr Trump told re­porters who asked about Judge Bar­rett’s im­mi­nent nom­i­na­tion at Joint Base An­drews out­side Wash­ing­ton af­ter CNN and other news out­lets re­ported on his choice.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s po­lit­i­cal ad­vis­ers hope the se­lec­tion will en­er­gise his con­ser­va­tive po­lit­i­cal base in the thick of an elec­tion cam­paign in which he has for months been trail­ing for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe</p>
    <p>Bi­den, his Demo­cratic chal­lenger.</p>
    <p>But it could also rouse lib­eral vot­ers afraid that her con­fir­ma­tion could spell the end of Roe vs Wade, the de­ci­sion le­gal­is­ing abor­tion, as well as other rul­ings pop­u­lar with the po­lit­i­cal left and cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The nom­i­na­tion will kick off an ex­tra­or­di­nary scram­ble by Se­nate Repub­li­cans to con­firm her for the court in the 38 days be­fore the elec­tion on Nov 3, a sce­nario un­like any in Amer­i­can his­tory.</p>
    <p>While other jus­tices have been ap­proved in pres­i­den­tial elec­tion years, none has been voted on af­ter July.</p>
    <p>In pick­ing Judge Bar­rett, a con­ser­va­tive and a hero to the anti-abor­tion move­ment, Mr Trump could hardly have found a more po­lar op­po­site to Judge Gins­burg, a pi­o­neer­ing cham­pion of women’s rights and leader of the lib­eral wing of the court. The ap­point­ment would also shift the cen­tre of grav­ity on the bench con­sid­er­ably to the right, giv­ing con­ser­va­tives six of the nine seats and po­ten­tially in­su­lat­ing them even against de­fec­tions by Chief Jus­tice John Roberts, who on a hand­ful of oc­ca­sions has sided with lib­eral jus­tices.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump made clear this past week that he wanted to rush his</p>
    <p>nom­i­nee through the Se­nate by elec­tion day to en­sure that he would have a de­ci­sive fifth jus­tice on his side in case any dis­putes from the vote reached the high court, as he ex­pected to hap­pen. The Pres­i­dent has re­peat­edly made claims that the Democrats are try­ing to steal the elec­tion and ap­pears poised to chal­lenge any re­sult of the bal­lot­ing that does not de­clare him the win­ner.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Mitch McCon­nell, the ma­jor­ity leader, has enough votes to push through Judge Bar­rett’s nom­i­na­tion if he can make the tight time frame work. Repub­li­cans are look­ing at hold­ing hear­ings be­fore the Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee in the week of Oct 16 and a floor vote by late Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed, Judge Bar­rett would be­come the 115th jus­tice in the na­tion’s his­tory and the fifth woman ever to serve on the Supreme Court. At 48, she would be the youngest mem­ber of the cur­rent court as well its sixth Catholic.</p>
    <p>And she would be­come Mr Trump’s third ap­pointee on the court, more than any other pres­i­dent has in­stalled in a first term since Richard Nixon had four, join­ing Jus­tices Neil Gor­such and Brett Ka­vanaugh.</p>
    <p>She has been a judge for only three years, ap­pointed by Mr Trump to the 7th US Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals in 2017. Her con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing pro­duced fire­works when Demo­cratic sen­a­tors ques­tioned her pub­lic state­ments and Catholi­cism. That made her an in­stant celebrity among re­li­gious con­ser­va­tives, who saw her as a vic­tim of bias on the ba­sis of her faith.</p>
    <p>Judge Bar­rett and her hus­band, Jesse Bar­rett, a for­mer fed­eral pros­e­cu­tor, are re­ported to be mem­bers of a small and rel­a­tively ob­scure Chris­tian group called the Peo­ple of Praise. The cou­ple have seven chil­dren, all un­der 20, in­clud­ing two adopted from Haiti and a young son with Down syn­drome.</p>
    <p>In pick­ing Judge Bar­rett, a con­ser­va­tive and a hero to the anti-abor­tion move­ment, Mr Trump could hardly have found a more po­lar op­po­site to Judge Gins­burg, a pi­o­neer­ing cham­pion of women’s rights and leader of the lib­eral wing of the court.</p>
