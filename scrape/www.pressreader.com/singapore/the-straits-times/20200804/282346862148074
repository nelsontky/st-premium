    <p>So, have I ever seen any­thing like Lewis Hamil­ton’s dra­matic last lap in the Bri­tish Grand Prix at Sil­ver­stone on Sun­day?</p>
    <p>Yes. And no.</p>
    <p>Yes, in­so­far as Philippe Streiff crossed the fin­ish line in Ade­laide on three wheels in his Ligier af­ter a last-lap col­li­sion in the 1985 Aus­tralian Grand Prix dur­ing a bat­tle with his se­nior team­mate, Jac­ques Laf­fite.</p>
    <p>Yes, in­so­far as Kimi Raikko­nen was lead­ing the last lap of the 2005 Grand Prix of Europe for McLaren, only to suf­fer a de­bil­i­tat­ing right front tyre fail­ure which smashed his sus­pen­sion and handed vic­tory to Re­nault’s Fer­nando Alonso.</p>
    <p>Yes, in­so­far as Hamil­ton him­self crossed the fin­ish line in a bat­tered Mercedes in Aus­tria in 2016 af­ter a Turn 3 col­li­sion on the last lap with his own team­mate, Nico Ros­berg.</p>
    <p>But no, in­so­far as the driver run­ning into prob­lems each time was not be­ing hunted down by a po­ten­tial win­ner. On Sun­day, Hamil­ton had the agony of lis­ten­ing to his race en­gi­neer Pete Bon­ning­ton count­ing down the ap­proach of men­ac­ing Max, and just made it by 5.856 sec­onds. The tragedy was that there was no crowd to see it.</p>
    <p>Truly, it was a drama that cried out for vis­i­ble and audi­ble hu­man emo­tional re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Such has been a sport­ing cost of Covid-19, if one may be al­lowed to ex­press such a thing with­out wish­ing in any way to be seen to be dis­count­ing the dread­ful hu­man cost.</p>
    <p>In the first in­stance, the changes wrought by the coro­n­avirus make them­selves im­me­di­ately ap­par­ent the mo­ment you reach the track.</p>
    <p>There is al­most zero traf­fic on the way in, no queue of ve­hi­cles when you reach the en­try gates.</p>
    <p>Every four days, it’s time to make a left turn and to let Eurofins op­er­a­tives make you gag swab­bing your ton­sils be­fore stick­ing the same spat­ula up one of your nos­trils.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one is wear­ing a mask. No­body is al­lowed to hug. It’s fist bumps and el­bow taps, or noth­ing.</p>
    <p>As Sky TV com­men­ta­tor Martin Brun­dle wryly asked the other day, “Will we ever shake hands with peo­ple again?”</p>
    <p>Talk is all of bio­spheres or bub­bles, lim­ited groups in which nom­i­nated per­son­nel must travel and from which they may not stray.</p>
    <p>Teams have bub­bles within bub­bles. Safety is the watch­word, and the For­mula One Group and the In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion (FIA) have done a sim­ply bril­liant job to show­case</p>
    <p>F1’s abil­ity to put on a great in­ter­na­tional show with min­i­mal risk to any­one.</p>
    <p>Yes, it’s ster­ile, and it hurts not be­ing able to en­ter the pad­dock and hang out with all your pals and the peo­ple who make F1 so en­joy­able, or to speak with the driv­ers and team per­son­nel other than on Zoom or sim­i­lar com­mu­ni­ca­tion sites. But this is the new world of F1, and we should be grate­ful at least that it fa­cil­i­tates the show con­tin­u­ing.</p>
    <p>Next week­end it con­tin­ues here at Sil­ver­stone, one of the world’s great race­tracks, with the 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Cyn­ics sug­gest clev­erly that Pirelli ap­pears to be the only “team” which can un­seat Mercedes – Max Ver­stap­pen be­lieves that with a 30-point lead al­ready Hamil­ton is vir­tu­ally un­stop­pable – re­fer­ring to the Ital­ian sup­plier’s cur­rent in­ten­tion to bring yet softer tyres for the up­com­ing race.</p>
    <p>Given the time scales and the lo­gis­tics in­volved, I’d be sur­prised to see that change, which means teams ei­ther gam­bling even more or re­sort­ing to re­vised strate­gies with two rather than one pit stop, though it should be noted that a se­cond safety car de­ploy­ment prompted ear­lier stops than many had ini­tially planned on Sun­day, thus ex­ac­er­bat­ing the punc­ture prob­lems at the end.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, though, I’m not ex­pect­ing Mercedes to be top­pled on pace.</p>
    <p>The tragedy was that there was no crowd to see it. Truly, it was a drama that cried out for vis­i­ble and audi­ble hu­man emo­tional re­ac­tion.</p>
