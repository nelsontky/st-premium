    <p>For­eign work­ers have been re­minded that any­one who in­cites vi­o­lence, in­clud­ing on so­cial me­dia, may be jailed, fined and banned from en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>An ad­vi­sory is­sued by the au­thor­i­ties this month, amid con­cerns over the spike in rad­i­cals in­cit­ing vi­o­lence on­line fol­low­ing re­cent ter­ror in­ci­dents in France, re­minded them that such in­cite­ment will be dealt with swiftly and sternly.</p>
    <p>The note, which has been trans­lated into Ben­gali, Tamil, Man­darin and Ba­hasa In­done­sia, also cau­tioned them against im­port­ing for­eign pol­i­tics, and asked them to ap­proach their dor­mi­tory man­ager, em­ployer or religious lead­ers for coun­selling should they be af­fected by in­ci­dents abroad.</p>
    <p>It also urged the work­ers to re­port to the au­thor­i­ties any­one they know to be in­volved in vi­o­lent ex­trem­ist ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam told re­porters yes­ter­day that while there is con­cern about for­eign­ers us­ing Sin­ga­pore as a base for ag­i­tat­ing vi­o­lence abroad, “we ought not be look­ing at ev­ery mi­grant worker as a po­ten­tial ter­ror­ist”.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber who cross the line are the mi­nut­est frac­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Most of them are here for an honourable pur­pose. They are try­ing to feed their fam­i­lies back home, who are in very poor cir­cum­stances. Their main fo­cus is to do an hon­est day’s work, get an hon­est day’s wage.”</p>
    <p>For­eign work­ers were also ad­vised against mak­ing any re­marks, in­clud­ing posts and com­ments on­line, that may of­fend or en­cour­age ill will against any race, re­li­gion, na­tion­al­ity or group.</p>
    <p>Dr Ro­han Gu­naratna, pro­fes­sor of se­cu­rity stud­ies at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, said the threat in France has cre­ated a mo­men­tum for protests and at­tacks else­where.</p>
    <p>“This call is rad­i­cal­is­ing and mo­bil­is­ing vul­ner­a­ble seg­ments of Mus­lims world­wide,” he said, not­ing that at­tacks in Aus­tria and Saudi Ara­bia show ide­o­log­i­cal ex­trem­ism has trans­lated into vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has re­sponded pre­emp­tively to dis­rupt the height­ened threat from break­ing out into vi­o­lence, he added, say­ing “the global threat is likely to man­i­fest in Asia and per­sist un­til Christ­mas and the New Year”.</p>
