    <p>Lo­cal stocks drifted through most of the ses­sion yes­ter­day in the ab­sence of sig­nif­i­cant mar­ket-mov­ing de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) ended the day mostly un­changed at 2,618.48, down 5.19 points or 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>The 30 STI com­po­nents were well dis­persed, with 12 end­ing higher, 12 lower and six un­changed.</p>
    <p>Across the wider mar­ket, gain­ers out­num­bered losers 241 to 189, with 1.58 bil­lion shares worth $986.66 mil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>The three best per­form­ers were Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust, which added 2.51 per cent; Sats, up 1.75 per cent; and Hongkong Land, ahead by 1.01 per cent.</p>
    <p>The three worst were Jar­dine Strate­gic, down 2.76 per cent; Jar­dine Cy­cle & Car­riage, which fell 2.69 per cent; while Com­fortDelGro was 1.38 per cent be­hind.</p>
    <p>En­ergy firm Rex In­ter­na­tional ended up 4.55 per cent at 18.4 cents, af­ter it said Oman had given ap­proval for its 86.37 per cent-owned unit Masirah Oil to de­velop the Yumna Field, while con­tin­u­ing to ex­plore the rest of Block 50 Oman.</p>
    <p>Rex also said the au­thor­i­ties in Nor­way have im­proved tax in­cen­tives on cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture, which could ben­e­fit its 2019 Shrek dis­cov­ery, where pro­duc­tion is due to start by the end of 2024.</p>
    <p>Else­where, the lead­ing ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the Covid-19 pan­demic re­bounded yes­ter­day, af­ter suf­fer­ing steep sell-offs in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>Among glove mak­ers, Top Glove jumped 15.87 per cent to $7.52, while UG Health­care bounced 24.24 per cent to $1.64. Safety gear sup­plier Medtecs In­ter­na­tional closed at 62.5 cents, up 20.19 per cent.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets were slightly up. The Hang Seng In­dex added 0.47 per cent, end­ing a tough week for Hong Kong stocks which have been hit by China-United States ten­sions as well as a Covid-19 flare-up.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai rose 0.13 per cent while Shen­zhen gained 0.69 per cent.</p>
    <p>South Korean shares inched up 0.8 per cent, putting the Kospi ahead 2.37 per cent for the week, its best weekly gain in six weeks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ja­pan’s Nikkei fell 0.32 per cent as Tokyo an­nounced a fresh record of virus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Eyes will be on Europe, where lead­ers were sched­uled to be­gin their first face-to-face sum­mit in five months yes­ter­day to dis­cuss their US$850 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) res­cue pack­age. How­ever, there are low ex­pec­ta­tions for a deal with Den­mark, Swe­den, Aus­tria and the Nether­lands hold­ing out. “The fru­gal four may use this sum­mit to voice their fi­nal con­cerns over joint debt and grants for the weaker states,” said Oanda an­a­lyst Ed­ward Moya.</p>
