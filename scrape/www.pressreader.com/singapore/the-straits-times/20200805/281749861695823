    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state Vic­to­ria has said that any­one break­ing Covid-19 self-iso­la­tion or­ders will face hefty fines as high as A$20,000 (S$19,650), and that more mil­i­tary per­son­nel will be de­ployed to fight the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, once her­alded as a global leader in con­tain­ing Covid-19, is des­per­ately try­ing to slow the spread of the virus in Vic­to­ria to pre­vent a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria ear­lier this week im­posed a night cur­few, tight­ened re­stric­tions on peo­ple’s daily move­ments and or­dered large parts of the lo­cal econ­omy to close to slow the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But nearly a third of those who had con­tracted Covid-19 were not at home iso­lat­ing when checked on by of­fi­cials, re­quir­ing tough new penal­ties, Vic­to­ria’s Premier Daniel An­drews said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Fines of nearly A$5,000 will be is­sued to any­one breach­ing stayat-home or­ders. Re­peat of­fend­ers face a fine of up to A$20,000.</p>
    <p>“There is lit­er­ally no rea­son for you to leave your home, and if you were to leave your home and not be found there, you will have a very dif­fi­cult time con­vinc­ing Vic­to­ria po­lice that you have a law­ful rea­son,” Mr An­drews told re­porters in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>The only ex­emp­tion will be for ur­gent med­i­cal care, said Mr An­drews, adding that any­one un­der a self-iso­la­tion or­der will no longer be al­lowed to leave their homes for out­door ex­er­cise. “Fresh air at the front door. Fresh air in your front yard or back­yard or open­ing a win­dow,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said an ad­di­tional 500 un­armed mil­i­tary per­son­nel will de­ploy to Vic­to­ria this week to as­sist po­lice in en­sur­ing that self-iso­la­tion or­ders are be­ing com­plied with.</p>
    <p>The lat­est mil­i­tary de­ploy­ment will add to about 1,500 troops al­ready in Vic­to­ria and en­gaged in con­tact trac­ing, test­ing and as­sist­ing po­lice at check­points. Aus­tralia has de­ployed al­most 3,000 troops to help in virus lo­gis­ti­cal op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded nearly 19,000 Covid-19 cases and 232 fa­tal­i­ties, far fewer than many other de­vel­oped na­tions af­ter clos­ing its in­ter­na­tional bor­ders early, im­pos­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions and mass virus test­ing.</p>
    <p>But as the coun­try be­gan to re­open, com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions rose sig­nif­i­cantly in Vic­to­ria, which has recorded triple-digit new cases for weeks. It now has the bulk of in­fec­tions in the coun­try, with nearly 12,000 re­ported cases.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Vic­to­ria re­ported 439 new cases over the past 24 hours. Mr An­drews said 11 peo­ple had died from the virus since Mon­day, bring­ing the state’s death toll to 136.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state of­fi­cials said the lat­est wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions has been driven by res­i­dents re­fus­ing to ad­here to re­stric­tions on their move­ments.</p>
