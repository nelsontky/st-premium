    <p>NEW YORK • Amer­i­can talk show host Ellen DeGeneres’ im­age has taken a beat­ing af­ter re­cent al­le­ga­tions of a toxic work­place on the set of The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions have also stirred up bad mem­o­ries for singer Mariah Carey af­ter clips of her ap­pear­ance on the talk show 12 years ago resur­faced on so­cial media.</p>
    <p>There were ru­mours in 2008 of Carey’s preg­nancy af­ter she mar­ried co­me­dian-rap­per Nick Can­non ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>On the talk show, DeGeneres asked Carey to con­firm or deny the ru­mours. When Carey tried to change the sub­ject, DeGeneres of­fered her a glass of cham­pagne to “toast not be­ing preg­nant”. When the singer pre­tended to take a sip, DeGeneres ex­claimed that she was in­deed preg­nant.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with en­ter­tain­ment web­site Vul­ture, Carey, now 50, said: “I was ex­tremely un­com­fort­able with that mo­ment is all I can say. And I re­ally have had a hard time grap­pling with the af­ter­math.”</p>
    <p>She re­vealed only in 2010 that she suf­fered a mis­car­riage in 2008, soon af­ter that in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The Al­ways Be My Baby singer said in the Vul­ture in­ter­view that there is “an em­pa­thy that can be ap­plied to those mo­ments that I would have liked to have been im­ple­mented. But what am I sup­posed to do? It’s like, ‘What are you go­ing to do?’”</p>
    <p>She added that she “wasn’t ready to tell any­one be­cause I had had a mis­car­riage. I don’t want to throw any­one that’s al­ready be­ing thrown un­der any prover­bial bus, but I didn’t en­joy that mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>Carey gave birth to twins Moroc­can and Mon­roe in April 2011. She and Can­non di­vorced in 2016.</p>
