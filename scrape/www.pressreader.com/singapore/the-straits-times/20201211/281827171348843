    <p>JAKARTA • Cleric Rizieq Shi­hab and five other peo­ple have been named as suspects by the Jakarta po­lice in their in­ves­ti­ga­tions into a mass event last month that breached Covid-19 health rules.</p>
    <p>“The re­sult of our in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­cludes that there are six suspects in this case. The first is Mr Rizieq, who is charged un­der Ar­ti­cles 160 and 216 of the Crim­i­nal Code,” Jakarta Po­lice spokesman Yusri Yunus said yes­ter­day, as re­ported by kom­pas.com.</p>
    <p>The cleric, who leads the in­flu­en­tial Is­lamic De­fend­ers’ Front (FPI) group, held an event at his home and FPI head­quar­ters in cen­tral Jakarta on Nov 15 to com­mem­o­rate Prophet Muham­mad’s birth­day and his daugh­ter’s wed­ding, draw­ing thou­sands of his sup­port­ers and spark­ing anger from the pub­lic amid Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>He was fined 50 mil­lion ru­piah (S$4,700) by the Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion for dis­re­gard­ing health pro­to­cols im­posed to curb the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Other FPI mem­bers iden­ti­fied by their ini­tials as suspects in­clude the head of the event or­gan­iser HU, the or­gan­iser’s sec­re­tary A and the or­gan­iser’s se­cu­rity division head MS.</p>
    <p>Two more suspects are the or­gan­iser’s guar­an­tor SL and the or­gan­iser’s event division head HI.</p>
    <p>“We have up­graded the sta­tus of these six peo­ple from wit­nesses to suspects,” Mr Yusri said, adding that the move came fol­low­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the Jakarta Po­lice’s gen­eral crimes unit.</p>
    <p>Violations of Ar­ti­cle 160 on the in­cite­ment of crim­i­nal acts can be pun­ished with up to six years of im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­cle 216 of the Crim­i­nal Code stip­u­lates a pri­son sen­tence of up to four months and two weeks for those found guilty of ob­struct­ing law en­force­ment ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Po­lice have sum­moned Mr Rizieq sev­eral times for ques­tion­ing re­gard­ing the al­leged health pro­to­col violations, but he has yet to com­ply with their re­quest.</p>
    <p>Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan and West Java Gov­er­nor Rid­wan Kamil have also been ques­tioned as wit­nesses in the case.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, na­tional po­lice chief Id­ham Azis has re­moved Jakarta Po­lice chief in­spec­tor Nana Sud­jana and West Java Po­lice chief in­spec­tor Rudy Su­fahri­adi from their posts for their fail­ure to en­force the coro­n­avirus health pro­to­col.</p>
