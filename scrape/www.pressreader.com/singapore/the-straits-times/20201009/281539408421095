    <p>The fu­ture of education is not about tech­ni­cal skills alone. While an artist’s medium may evolve from paint to pix­els, what does not change is ideation and a search for knowl­edge, says Dr Venka Pu­rushothama­n, provost of Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts.</p>
    <p>Education is at a crit­i­cal cross­roads world­wide, has­tened by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With tra­di­tional mod­els of class­rooms, les­son de­liv­ery and learning and teach­ing dis­rupted, as well as the larger ques­tion of how we pre­pare our stu­dents to en­ter a world of mas­sive global up­heaval, we stand at an in­flec­tion point.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been an arts ed­u­ca­tor for more than 15 years, I be­lieve many of the guid­ing prin­ci­ples of arts education are il­lu­mi­nat­ing and rel­e­vant now more than ever be­fore. Education is not a short-term game. The changes we seed to­day will bear tes­ta­ment to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>An arts education is more than teach­ing some­one tech­ni­cal skills of how to draw, dance, act or de­sign. At its heart, an arts education is about bring­ing out the cre­ative po­ten­tial in hu­mans, from dis­cov­er­ing new path­ways to draw­ing new con­clu­sions, and know­ing how to use and in­te­grate con­tem­po­rary tools, ma­te­ri­als and tech­nolo­gies with tra­di­tional prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The arts mir­rors so­ci­ety’s evo­lu­tion and artists ac­quire an in­quis­i­tive­ness about the world through their ideas, tools and cre­ative ex­pres­sions – skills rel­e­vant not only in the ca­reers of the fu­ture, but also in nav­i­gat­ing and shap­ing that fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a 2019 study by the In­sti­tute for the Fu­ture and Dell Tech­nolo­gies, 85 per cent of the jobs that will ex­ist in 2030 haven’t even been cre­ated yet. The new world of work will ex­ist solely in re­la­tion to the “ever-chang­ing na­ture of tech­nol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board chief Chng Kai Fong re­cently said, dig­i­tal and tech­ni­cal skills alone will not be enough. Soft skills – the abil­ity to tell a story, have em­pa­thy and cre­ate con­nec­tions with oth­ers – will help peo­ple to stand out and dif­fer­en­ti­ate them­selves. This is where an arts education ex­cels.</p>
    <p>In school, when our stu­dents de­velop their own artistic and cre­ative vo­cab­u­lary and gram­mar, they em­bark on a life­long jour­ney of cre­ative dis­cov­ery that will con­tinue through­out their pro­fes­sional and, in­deed, per­sonal lives. The artist’s jour­ney can be a long and lonely one. Our role as ed­u­ca­tors is to equip them well for this jour­ney.</p>
    <p>REDEFINING THE CLASS­ROOM</p>
    <p>At Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts, we have been de­lib­er­at­ing the fu­ture of education in the past few years, as we saw a shift in learning pat­terns among young adults born post-2000. To stand and lec­ture in front of a class is no longer the only op­tion. The pan­demic has brought this crit­i­cally to the fore­front.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents no longer need to come to school to get in­for­ma­tion. They can get it any­where – that’s the beauty of the dig­i­tal world. What then be­comes im­por­tant is for them to learn how to col­late, in­ter­pret, edit and cu­rate this on­slaught of in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, what is im­por­tant for us as ed­u­ca­tors is to ex­pand the def­i­ni­tion of the class­room as a space for analysis and polyvo­cal­ity of ideas to flour­ish.</p>
    <p>Last year, we de­vel­oped a new learning and teach­ing strat­egy that maps the core DNA of Lasalle’s ed­u­ca­tional pro­grammes for the next five to 10 years. One of the key pil­lars of this strat­egy was the de­vel­op­ment of a “cre­ative-plus space”.</p>
    <p>What does this mean? It means that the “class­room” it­self must be trans­formed into a place where tech­nol­ogy, new ideas and di­verse cul­tures co­a­lesce, evolve and de­velop.</p>
    <p>The “class­room” is not just about the phys­i­cal trap­pings of an ed­u­ca­tional space. It is how the stu­dio cul­ture of the school be­comes a four-di­men­sional space, one in­fused with dig­i­tal face-to-face in­ter­ac­tiv­ity and draw­ing on myr­iad vir­tual, live-streamed and record­ing pos­si­bil­i­ties. The “class­room” op­er­ates within a space and out­side of a space.</p>
    <p>In this as­pect, we of­ten found our­selves led by stu­dents in a pleas­ant role re­ver­sal. Our tech-savvy Gen Z stu­dent-artists took to tech­nol­ogy-in­ter­faced learning and as­sess­ment as fish take to wa­ter, and helped the teach­ing fac­ulty ap­pre­ci­ate po­ten­tial they had not con­sid­ered, act­ing as men­tors. Cre­ative play emerged with small, de­light­ful ex­pres­sions via What­sApp, memes and so­cial me­dia along­side as­sign­ments.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents be­gan en­gag­ing more with artists, de­sign­ers and cul­tures from around the world. In this man­ner, we did not fear so­cial me­dia but made it our strate­gic teach­ing tool.</p>
    <p>We have found ways to thrive on es­tab­lished plat­forms such as Zoom, while also ex­plor­ing spe­cialised so­lu­tions for arts education. One ex­am­ple of what we have im­ple­mented is soft­ware that al­lows our the­atre pro­duc­tion and man­age­ment stu­dents to re­hearse call­ing show cues dig­i­tally, at their own pace. This is one of the first in­stances world­wide of a vir­tual learning tool be­ing used for tech­ni­cal the­atre stu­dents, who typ­i­cally get their train­ing on set dur­ing an ac­tual show.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, how­ever, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion is a means to an end, not an end – it is about con­tin­u­ally im­prov­ing and en­hanc­ing the learning en­vi­ron­ment to pro­vide more op­por­tu­ni­ties and ex­po­sure for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing in the dig­i­tal world is some­thing that all emerg­ing artists have to be able to do and need to know how to man­age. But this is just the start­ing point. Our chal­lenge as ed­u­ca­tors has al­ways been to look sev­eral steps ahead, to­wards a world that will be very dif­fer­ent from what it was when our stu­dents first en­rolled.</p>
    <p>How do we pre­pare our stu­dents for a world we can’t even de­fine yet? We go back to the ba­sics: think­ing, mak­ing and do­ing.</p>
    <p>‘MOVABLE IDEAS’</p>
    <p>This process is the cor­ner­stone of an arts education. While an artist’s medium may evolve from paint to pix­els, and an ex­hi­bi­tion space from a phys­i­cal to a vir­tual room, what does not change is ideation and a search for knowl­edge. What does not change is the con­nec­tions we make with peo­ple, with col­lab­o­ra­tors, fel­low artists and the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>When stu­dents are able to con­struct “movable ideas” that can be im­ple­mented in a wide va­ri­ety of plat­forms, dis­ci­plines and sec­tors, it builds agility and con­fi­dence to work across dis­ci­plines. These are the skills that will stand arts grad­u­ates in good stead to take on a wide range of pro­fes­sions and even cre­ate their own in a volatile fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, we should not de­fine the world for our stu­dents. Rather, we should give them the tools to build their own ap­proaches, in­sti­tu­tions and industries.</p>
    <p>The fu­ture of education re­quires, be­sides the ac­qui­si­tion of dis­ci­pline-spe­cific knowl­edge, the abil­ity to shape learning. We can do this by en­cour­ag­ing our stu­dents to be­come au­thors of their education. We charge them to be coura­geous to take a road less trav­elled in or­der to re­de­fine the pre­dictable. I have seen gen­er­a­tions of arts stu­dents flour­ish when chal­lenged in this man­ner. I have no doubt that we will see many more emerge out of this pan­demic.</p>
