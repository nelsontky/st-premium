    <p>Af­ter months of slid­ing rentals and in­creased va­can­cies, China’s rental mar­ket showed signs of a re­bound last month, while real es­tate sales re­flected pent-up de­mand from ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>But is the rental mar­ket truly out of the woods? Is this re­cov­ery sus­tain­able in the long term?</p>
    <p>Amid a global pan­demic and an un­cer­tain eco­nomic fu­ture, China’s prop­erty mar­ket was dealt a body blow, with huge dis­counts be­ing of­fered on res­i­den­tial units and com­mer­cial build­ings see­ing some of their low­est oc­cu­pancy rates ever.</p>
    <p>With ex­pa­tri­ates leav­ing the coun­try dur­ing the height of the pan­demic and lo­cals hav­ing to con­tend with curbs on trav­el­ling be­tween prov­inces, agents were hard-pressed to fill empty units.</p>
    <p>The con­trol mea­sures kept new ten­ants out­side the coun­try, while those al­ready in the city could not en­ter closed-off res­i­den­tial com­pounds to view the apart­ments.</p>
    <p>At the mar­ket’s low­est point, land­lords were of­fer­ing 30 per cent dis­counts on homes, while com­mer­cial units were go­ing at nearly 50 per cent off, said prop­erty agent Lily Meng.</p>
    <p>“Those who re­fused to l ower their prices sim­ply had no ten­ants – a flat be­long­ing to a former client has been empty for eight months now,” she said.</p>
    <p>“There was also a time around June when of­fices in the cen­tral busi­ness district were go­ing for 350 yuan (S$69) per square foot, nearly half price.”</p>
    <p>In mid-July, agent Zhang Liang, who spe­cialises in prop­er­ties in the Chaoyang district of Bei­jing, told the Bei­jing Daily news­pa­per that there were at least 150 empty units in one devel­op­ment alone.</p>
    <p>A search on rental web­sites showed most units were be­ing of­fered with at least a 10 per cent discount on rent. Ac­cord­ing to home rental com­pany Ilove­my­home, Bei­jing rental transactio­ns in the first half of this year were down 23.1 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral agents The Straits Times spoke to said this was mostly due to the lack of a “sum­mer peak”, which usu­ally co­in­cides with grad­u­a­tion sea­son.</p>
    <p>Miss Meng said: “Many ter­tiary stu­dents have had their grad­u­a­tions de­layed so that ‘peak’ we usu­ally see this time of the year has been a lot more muted.”</p>
    <p>She added that when the mar­ket ap­peared to warm up in May, the city was hit by a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions linked to a whole­sale mar­ket, fur­ther de­lay­ing re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Agents who of­ten work on three­year con­sign­ment con­tracts – promis­ing land­lords reg­u­lar pay­ments even when units sit empty – have seen their in­comes plum­met.</p>
    <p>Since then, stronger eco­nomic fig­ures from the sec­ond quar­ter and pent-up de­mand have helped with price re­cov­ery, though it still re­mains a renters’ mar­ket.</p>
    <p>A three-bed­room prop­erty in cen­tral Bei­jing, which usu­ally goes for at least 28,000 yuan a month, can be had for 24,000 yuan.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, home pur­chases have con­tin­ued to show steady re­cov­ery as a re­sult of pent-up de­mand, lower sup­ply and a re­newed fo­cus on more sta­ble as­sets.</p>
    <p>The first-hand mar­ket in Bei­jing had 1.15 mil­lion sq m of transactio­ns in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, nearly dou­ble the vol­ume in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, said real es­tate ser­vices firm Sav­ills in a re­search note.</p>
    <p>This was espe­cially ap­par­ent in the high-end mar­ket, where de­spite steadily ris­ing prices, transactio­ns were up over 250 per cent com­pared with the first quar­ter, a nearly 12 per cent in­crease in com­par­i­son with last year.</p>
    <p>“At this stage of the post</p>
    <p>EMPTY UNITS</p>
    <p>Those who re­fused to lower their prices sim­ply had no ten­ants – a flat be­long­ing to a former client has been empty for eight months now. There was also a time around June when of­fices in the cen­tral busi­ness district were go­ing for</p>
    <p>350 yuan (S$69) per square ’’ foot, nearly half price. PROP­ERTY AGENT LILY MENG, on hefty dis­counts be­ing of­fered dur­ing the mar­ket’s low­est point.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 land­scape, the high-end or up­grade mar­ket is ex­pected to per­form bet­ter than rigid de­mand hous­ing projects, which had been the back­bone of the res­i­den­tial sales mar­ket in re­cent years,” the firm pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally, home prices also in­creased last month, ris­ing 4.8 per cent as com­pared with the same time last year, said official fig­ures from the Na­tional Bureau of Sta­tis­tics (NBS) which were re­leased last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Of the 70 cities tracked by the govern­ment agency, prices rose the most in Yinchuan, the cap­i­tal of Ningxia prov­ince in north-west China.</p>
    <p>NBS chief statis­ti­cian Kong Peng said: “Lo­cal gov­ern­ments are strictly fol­low­ing the cen­tral govern­ment’s di­rec­tive that houses are for liv­ing in and not for spec­u­la­tion, and are pay­ing spe­cial at­ten­tion to the steady and healthy devel­op­ment of the sec­tor with timely and ac­cu­rate mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>In a bid to at­tract and re­tain tal­ent who might oth­er­wise seek work in the main me­trop­o­lises, cities such as Yinchuan, He­fei and Chengdu have in­tro­duced “tal­ent pro­grammes” that of­fer uni­ver­sity grad­u­ates or in­di­vid­u­als with spe­cific skills pri­or­ity in prop­erty pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Migrants in big cities of­ten have dif­fi­culty get­ting a “hukou”, or res­i­den­tial per­mit, which is nec­es­sary for home own­er­ship. But the new pro­gramme helps fast-track the process – al­beit in smaller cities.</p>
    <p>“Since a lot of com­pa­nies are more open to re­mote work­ing, I feel this of­fers me a small step up in prop­erty own­er­ship,” said Nan­jing Uni­ver­sity fi­nal-year stu­dent Tony Zhou, who told ST he plans to live and work in Hangzhou.</p>
    <p>And this is likely to be a trend that would con­tinue in the com­ing months, said China Ur­ban Real Es­tate Re­search In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Xie Yifeng.</p>
    <p>“A lot of sec­ond-tier cities with looser hous­ing poli­cies will prob­a­bly see a sus­tained de­mand for real es­tate there, espe­cially given the in­creased con­nec­tiv­ity,” he said, cit­ing Dong­guan’s con­nec­tiv­ity to tech hub Shen­zhen, and Foshan’s prox­im­ity to Guangzhou.</p>
    <p>“If the govern­ment con­tin­ues with poli­cies to keep prop­erty prices sta­ble, then it’s likely that growth can con­tinue and the real es­tate sec­tor can make a real con­tri­bu­tion to eco­nomic re­cov­ery.”</p>
