    <p>More bird species, some of them mi­gra­tory, are hom­ing in on ur­ban ar­eas, away from their habi­tats in man­groves and na­ture re­serves.</p>
    <p>This is one of the key find­ings of a five-year bird sur­vey that was pub­lished in book form by the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) and launched last week, ti­tled: A Re­view Of Gar­den Bird Watch (2015-2019).</p>
    <p>NParks’ Gar­den Bird Watch ini­tia­tive in­volved trained cit­i­zens and lasted from 2015 to last year.</p>
    <p>More than 180 bird species were spot­ted in 64 sites, in­clud­ing na­ture re­serves and ur­ban parks.</p>
    <p>By last year, about 4,900 cit­i­zens had helped iden­tify and count the birds spot­ted each year dur­ing the breed­ing sea­son in April and mi­gra­tory sea­son in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The 34 com­mon res­i­dent birds, such as the black-naped ori­ole, Eurasian tree spar­row and pink­necked green pi­geon, along with 16 oth­ers, showed sta­ble or up­ward trends in their abun­dance.</p>
    <p>“(Species abun­dance) is an im­por­tant bench­mark for any ecosys­tem. Some of them are also re­lated to our ef­forts in habi­tat en­hance­ment,” said Mr Low Bing Wen, se­nior man­ager of NParks’ Na­tional Bio­di­ver­sity Cen­tre and one of the book’s au­thors.</p>
    <p>Na­ture parks act as buf­fers be­tween ur­ban places and na­ture re­serves. As more na­tive plants and in­sects that birds can feed on are added to ur­ban parks, for in­stance, the birds start leav­ing their habi­tats to colonise these promis­ing new ones, in­creas­ing their spread and sur­vival chances.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is the malaysian pied fan­tail, a monochrome bird with a wide tail that spreads out like a Chi­nese fan. It used to be found only in man­groves and river banks in cer­tain coastal ar­eas.</p>
    <p>But as ur­ban wet­lands be­came more com­mon in places such as Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park, fan­tails started mov­ing in­land through the park con­nec­tor net­works to habi­tats around Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens and Jurong Lake Gar­dens.</p>
    <p>“The fan­tails tend not to fly very far, but some­how, when the habi­tats ap­pear, they find their way to these places,” said Mr Low.</p>
    <p>Their num­bers in­creased from four in 2015 to 13 last year.</p>
    <p>Since last month, flocks of mi­gra­tory birds have started land­ing in the Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve to es­cape win­ter in the North­ern Hemi­sphere. But those few species that fly into ur­ban green spa­ces are less talked about.</p>
    <p>“You are quite likely to see a mi­gra­tory bird re­fu­elling in a roof gar­den in your HDB es­tate,” said Mr Low.</p>
    <p>The brown shrike, a 20cm-long bird that is indige­nous to Rus­sia and China, prefers to take a hol­i­day in grass­land and large lawns be­fore jour­ney­ing to In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“Give it another month or so, you might even see one in your neigh­bour­hood pri­mary school soc­cer field,” said Mr Low.</p>
    <p>But he noted that al­though the en­vi­ron­ment here is con­ducive to the sur­vival of mi­gra­tory birds, they may still face threats as they cross over to other re­gions.</p>
    <p>“If the forests in, say, In­done­sia con­tinue to shrink and if peo­ple in North­ern Asia con­tinue to hunt brown shrikes, they will still suf­fer,” he pointed out.</p>
