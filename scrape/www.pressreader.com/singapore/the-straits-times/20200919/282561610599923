    <p>One would not ex­pect the owner of a 31-year-old Toy­ota Star­let – a hum­ble hatch pop­u­lar in the 1980s – to be a petrol­head. But Iskan­dar Dzulkhairi Ka­jai is an ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Iskan­dar’s other car is an As­ton Martin Rapide. His pre­vi­ous rides in­cluded a Mit­subishi Evo 8 and a Nis­san GTR. The 47-year-old op­er­a­tions man­ager of a fu­neral ser­vices com­pany has driven both Ja­panese per­for­mance cars on the Sepang race cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily car is a Honda Odyssey mul­ti­pur­pose ve­hi­cle (MPV), which is driven mostly by his wife Maslinda, 47. The cou­ple have two daugh­ters, aged 23 and 12, and two sons, aged 22 and 18.</p>
    <p>Mr Iskan­dar’s pre­vi­ous MPV was a Mit­subishi Gran­dis, which clocked 200,000km in four years, helped by fre­quent trips to Tereng­ganu for fam­ily hol­i­days in Pu­lau Redang.</p>
    <p>He bought the 1989-reg­is­tered third-gen­er­a­tion Toy­ota Star­let XL in Fe­bru­ary last year from his friend, who is the sec­ond owner of the car af­ter buy­ing it from an el­derly man who had the car for 28 years.</p>
    <p>The owner sold it to a scrap dealer in the third quar­ter of 2018. But the dealer did not scrap it be­cause the car’s cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) still had some months. The dealer con­tacted Mr Iskan­dar’s friend, who bought it with the in­ten­tion of re­new­ing its COE and giv­ing the car to his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>When Mr Iskan­dar learnt of the car, he told his friend that if he were to sell it, he wanted first right of re­fusal. The car held a sen­ti­men­tal value to Mr Iskan­dar, who had a Star­let when his chil­dren were young.</p>
    <p>His friend had a change of plans and sold the Star­let to Mr Iskan­dar, who paid $800 for it, and about $26,000 to re­new its COE.</p>
    <p>Mr Iskan­dar sent the sil­ver Star­let to a car body shop to be re­stored as rust had af­fected 10 to 20 per cent of the body. The car was oth­er­wise in fairly good con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“The roof lin­ing was orig­i­nal and in good con­di­tion, but I thought it was bet­ter to have it re­moved to check for rust. I wish I had not be­cause the roof was per­fect,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Iskan­dar also got the car re­sprayed to white, the orig­i­nal colour of the car body.</p>
    <p>He left the en­gine un­touched de­spite its 270,000km mileage. “The one-litre en­gine is sur­pris­ingly smooth and quiet,” he says, but adds that he changed the air-con­di­tion­ing com­pres­sor and al­ter­na­tor.</p>
    <p>He chanced upon an old set of Work Equip 01 wheels, had them re­fur­bished and in­stalled on his Star­let. He says they were once among the most sought-af­ter wheels.</p>
    <p>His other mod­i­fi­ca­tion was to re­place the orig­i­nal wing mir­rors with fender-mounted ones – a throw-back to cars of the 1970s. He had the idea of re­plac­ing the mir­rors af­ter com­ing across on In­sta­gram a photo of a mod­i­fied Star­let with fender mir­rors.</p>
    <p>“The orig­i­nal mir­rors did not give a good field of view and there were blind spots. I could only see one lane on each side,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the man­ual trans­mis­sion Star­let is driven by Mr Iskan­dar and his son Azim.</p>
    <p>“My pre­vi­ous Star­let was the first car I bought for my wife when the kids were lit­tle. It served the fam­ily very well for four years un­til the end of its COE,” Mr Iskan­dar says. “Now that I get the chance to own an­other one, I told my chil­dren never to sell it – even when I’m gone.”</p>
