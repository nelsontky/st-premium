    <p>WHERE 01-104, Block 204 Seran­goon Cen­tral</p>
    <p>OPEN 11.30am to 2.30pm, 4.30 to 11pm daily, closed on some Tues­days</p>
    <p>TEL 6382-2327/ 8654-4336</p>
    <p>This hid­den gem in Seran­goon Cen­tral is lo­cated in a cof­fee shop best known for its braised duck stall.</p>
    <p>But Tat Lee Seafood has its own fans. Go early on week­ends be­cause regulars take up most of the ta­bles at din­ner­time.</p>
    <p>A sig­na­ture favourite is Fried Chicken With Prawn Paste ($8 for small, $10 for medium, $12 for large). You can smell the dish be­ing cooked from 50m away.</p>
    <p>It is an ubiq­ui­tous zi char dish, but so many stalls get it wrong, of­ten with an over-salty or fishy ex­te­rior and bland or un­der­cooked in­te­rior.</p>
    <p>Tat Lee Seafood’s ver­sion is wellex­e­cuted. The wings are cooked through, with no blood­i­ness in­side. Every bite is flavour­some.</p>
    <p>Owner Sing Cheo Liang, 57, re­veals that the mid-joint wings are mar­i­nated overnight in pre­mium prawn paste from Hong Kong. Hua tiao wine goes into the mari­nade to bal­ance the prawn odour. The bat­ter is a blend of seven in­gre­di­ents that in­cludes corn flour and rice flour for crisp­ness.</p>
    <p>An­other star dish is Gong Bao Pork Belly ($10 for small, $12 for medium, $15 for large). Thin slices of pork belly are blanched and stir­fried in a house-blended tangy sauce of black vine­gar, sugar and oys­ter sauce, which keeps the dish from be­ing cloy­ing.</p>
    <p>Hot­plate Bean­curd Prawns ($12 for small, $15 for medium, $20 for large) are served on a siz­zling hot­plate with a pil­lowy bed of fried egg. The dish uses sea­wa­ter prawns that are de­liv­ered daily.</p>
    <p>If you want to take it away, it is packed in a plas­tic box and the dish comes drenched in a glassy corn­starch-thick­ened gravy with swirls of egg white.</p>
    <p>The take­away ver­sion looks and tastes home-cooked, a re­fresh­ing change if you are tired of eat­ing out.</p>
    <p>For an eco­nom­i­cal one-dish meal, go for the spicy Salt & Pep­per</p>
    <p>Ribs Rice ($5), which is not on the menu. The pork ribs are cooked in a house-blended sauce of ground white pep­per and fine salt.</p>
    <p>The meat is firm yet yields eas­ily when you sink your teeth into it. The white pep­per and chilli padi make for a fiery com­bi­na­tion. Ask for a less spicy ver­sion if you do not fancy hav­ing your mouth on fire. Opt for chicken if you pre­fer that.</p>
    <p>The a la carte ver­sion of Salt & Pep­per Ribs costs $8 for small, $10 for medium and $12 for large.</p>
