    <p>LON­DON • A Bri­tish drug com­pany said on Mon­day that an in­haled form of a com­monly used medicine could slash the odds of Covid-19 pa­tients be­com­ing se­verely ill, a sliver of good news in the race to find treat­ments that was met by sci­en­tists with equal mea­sures of cau­tion and cheer.</p>
    <p>The drug, based on in­ter­feron beta, a pro­tein nat­u­rally pro­duced by the body to or­ches­trate its re­sponse to viruses, has be­come the fo­cus of in­ten­si­fy­ing ef­forts in Bri­tain, China and the United States to treat Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have found that the coro­n­avirus at­tacks the body in part by block­ing its nat­u­ral in­ter­feron re­sponse, dis­arm­ing cells that would oth­er­wise be alert­ing neigh­bour­ing cells to ac­ti­vate their own genes and for­tify them­selves against the in­vad­ing virus.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, ad­min­is­ter­ing in­ter­feron to pa­tients could in­vig­o­rate their de­fences in the early stages of ill­ness. But giv­ing pa­tients in­ter­feron with­out elic­it­ing se­ri­ous side ef­fects has proved to be chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>The symp­toms of a sea­sonal flu, for ex­am­ple, are largely pro­duced by the mo­bil­i­sa­tion of the body’s in­ter­feron re­sponse, sci­en­tists said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish drug com­pany Sy­nair­gen tried to cir­cum­vent that prob­lem by de­vel­op­ing an in­haled form of in­ter­feron that di­rectly tar­gets cells in the lungs, rather than an in­jec­tion, which can pro­duce more in­tense side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>A small, double-blind trial that Sy­nair­gen con­ducted on coro­n­avirus pa­tients in nine Bri­tish hos­pi­tals showed promis­ing ini­tial re­sults. The in­haled form of in­ter­feron beta re­duces the odds of hos­pi­talised pa­tients be­com­ing se­verely ill – and need­ing ven­ti­la­tion, for ex­am­ple – by 79 per cent, com­pared with pa­tients who re­ceived a placebo.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients re­ceiv­ing the in­ter­feron beta drug were also twice as likely as pa­tients who re­ceived a placebo to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Breath­less­ness was also lower in pa­tients re­ceiv­ing the drug.</p>
    <p>But the sig­nif­i­cance of the find­ings was se­ri­ously limited by the small size of the trial.</p>
    <p>It in­volved only 101 pa­tients, Sy­nair­gen said, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult to know for cer­tain how ben­e­fi­cial the drug was or how it af­fected pa­tients dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>The study could not rule out that the drug was only marginally ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists also noted that while in­jectable in­ter­feron has his­tor­i­cally been used to treat hep­ati­tis in­fec­tions, the in­haled form of treat­ment was not yet li­censed or widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>King’s Col­lege Lon­don pro­fes­sor of virol­ogy Stu­art Neil said there had been fears early in the pan­demic that giv­ing in­ter­feron to pa­tients could worsen the over-ag­gres­sive im­mune re­sponse that was it­self sick­en­ing some of them.</p>
    <p>But more re­cent find­ings have in­di­cated that in­fected pa­tients mount a limited in­ter­feron re­sponse on their own.</p>
    <p>“It is very ex­cit­ing,” Prof Neil said. “By ba­si­cally in­hal­ing the in­ter­feron into the site of in­fec­tion, it looks like you are tak­ing the edge off the virus.”</p>
