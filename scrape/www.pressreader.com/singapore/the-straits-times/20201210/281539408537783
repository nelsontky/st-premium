    <p>A pre-school in New­ton that saw an out­break of sal­mo­nella and stom­ach flu has en­gaged a new food sup­plier, as it emerged that 60 chil­dren aged be­tween 18 months and six years have fallen ill. Kid­di­winkie School­house @ New­ton said five of the 60 sick chil­dren are con­firmed to have sal­mo­nella in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The pre-school in New­ton that saw an out­break of sal­mo­nella and stom­ach flu has en­gaged a new food sup­plier, as it emerged that 60 chil­dren aged be­tween 18 months and six years have fallen ill.</p>
    <p>They make up about one-third of the 175 chil­dren en­rolled at Kid­di­winkie School­house @ New­ton.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail sent to par­ents yes­ter­day evening, the pre-school said five of the 60 sick chil­dren are con­firmed to have sal­mo­nella in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Three of them are re­ceiv­ing treat­ment in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 55 are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing stom­ach flu symp­toms, which in­clude di­ar­rhoea and vom­it­ing.</p>
    <p>The pre-school also told par­ents in the e-mail that its kitchen staff have been thor­oughly briefed by Sin­ga­pore Food Agency of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate state­ment to The Straits Times, Kid­di­winkie School­house said it be­lieves the out­break is an iso­lated sit­u­a­tion and only chil­dren en­rolled at its New­ton branch are af­fected.</p>
    <p>It also said it is work­ing closely with the Health Min­istry and Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency to in­ves­ti­gate the case, and has en­hanced its clean­ing pro­to­col as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the pre-school had no­ti­fied par­ents that there was a spike in stom­ach flu cases among its pupils and up­dated them on Tues­day that there were four cases of sal­mo­nella and 18 cases of stom­ach flu.</p>
    <p>A Kid­di­winkie School­house spokesman said: “We deal with a large num­ber of fam­i­lies and it is al­ways im­por­tant for us to clar­ify the facts be­fore alert­ing par­ents to guard against caus­ing un­due con­cern.</p>
    <p>“We will now be con­tin­u­ing to pro­vide our com­mu­nity with reg­u­lar up­dates and in­for­ma­tion to en­sure that they re­main up­dated.”</p>
    <p>Its ex­pla­na­tion fol­lows com­plaints from some par­ents that the pre-school had told them not to speak to other par­ents about the out­break when they called to ask about the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>One par­ent, who asked not to be named, said her three-year-old daugh­ter came down with stom­ach flu on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“She was run­ning a high fever and was vom­it­ing, so I took her to see a doc­tor straight­away,” said the 38-year-old mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She added: “Sixty cases is a lot of sick chil­dren. Given that hy­giene pro­to­col has been stepped up dur­ing this pe­riod be­cause of Covid-19, the fact that this is hap­pen­ing is ap­palling.”</p>
    <p>Eating food con­tam­i­nated with the bac­terium Sal­mo­nella en­ter­i­tidis can cause di­ar­rhoea, fever, vom­it­ing and ab­dom­i­nal cramps, com­monly known as food poi­son­ing. A sal­mo­nella in­fec­tion can be fa­tal for young chil­dren, the el­derly and those with im­paired im­mune sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Stom­ach flu is caused by the norovirus which in­flames the stom­ach and in­testines.</p>
    <p>In March last year, 13 PAP Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion (PCF) Sparkle­tots pre-schools and the Plan Stu­dent Care Cen­tre were hit by a sal­mo­nella out­break, which af­fected 259 chil­dren and staff. It was traced to the con­sump­tion of food pre­pared by Kate’s Cater­ing.</p>
    <p>Its op­er­a­tions were sus­pended be­tween March and May last year.</p>
    <p>Since April last year, PCF has re­turned to us­ing in-house cooks.</p>
