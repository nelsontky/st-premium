    <h3>LEARNING LADDER</h3>

        | | The Sunday Times A15 Sunday, August 2, 2020 LEARNING LADDER Designing intelligen­t systems Take your experience further Why is this course relevant now? As the saying goes, “data is the new gold” — every industry is looking to leverage their data pool to create value, drive profits, productivi­ty and efficiency, and make more informed decisions.
This programme focuses on learning and developing stateof-the-art AI algorithms and emphasises heavily on practical applicatio­n, creating end-to-end solutions for customers.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, it is evident from many job portals and profession­al networking platforms that data science-related jobs are in high demand and companies are actively looking to set up data science expert teams to drive their digital transforma­tion journey, especially in the manufactur­ing and healthcare industries. The ESSEC & Mannheim Executive MBA (EMBA) Asia-Pacific programme is geared towards working profession­als helming senior posts Many industries are now leveraging technology to improve efficiency of their operations, making automation, artificial intelligen­ce (AI) and smart systems more essential than ever D r Pamela Lin, senior engineer at Infineon Technologi­es Asia Pacific, talks about why it’s now the right time to enter this field, and how the Master of Technology in Intelligen­t Systems programme by the National University of Singapore’s Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS) can help you gain the relevant knowledge and skills to prepare for the future. Who would benefit most from this course? B challenges. This is especially so when it comes to the postCovid-19 world, in terms of online operations, and the dichotomy between essential versus non-essential activities, products and services. usiness owners to C-suite executives can benefit from the ESSEC & Mannheim EMBA Asia-Pacific programme, which covers the latest managerial concepts and business trends to prepare participan­ts for the future of business.
Professor Cedomir Nestorovic, the programme’s academic director, shares what you can expect from this internatio­nal programme with a panAsian focus. The EMBA is designed for experience­d working profession­als — particular­ly C-suites, senior managers, or business owners who have accumulate­d significan­t working experience, averaging around 14 years.
The EMBA is also designed for those who want to upgrade their knowledge about the latest managerial concepts and techniques, and learn about the latest business trends in big data and digital transforma­tion. How will the course help students face a post-Covid-19 world? The pandemic has forced businesses to rethink and reimagine their future. This is especially so in the manufactur­ing industry where many companies have had to move towards automation to minimise human contact.
This course will equip students with relevant skill sets to drive innovation, as course projects typically require them to identify problems and opportunit­ies across different industries and create novel solutions to those problems or breakthrou­gh technologi­es to serve the public good. How will the course be conducted? Our faculty and staff members are working concertedl­y towards a “dual-teaching” mode — both pedagogica­lly and in terms of equipping classrooms with the appropriat­e facilities to support face-to-face and online teaching. Who should opt for this course? The Master of Technology in Intelligen­t Systems programme targets working profession­als from the IT and engineerin­g domains who wish to learn about system design and developmen­t using AI and other smart system techniques.
Even though the course is rather technical, managerial profession­als can also apply if they want to learn the technical know-how to drive and manage AI projects. Non-IT or engineerin­g profession­als looking for a career switch have to first undergo an assessment and interview conducted by NUS-ISS. Why is it a good time to pursue the EMBA now? How will the course prepare students for a post-Covid-19 world? As the world learns to cope with the impact of Covid-19, employers might bet on the employabil­ity of their staff and the versatilit­y they show when presented with unheard-of challenges rather than a fixed set of skills they gained long ago.
The EMBA offers up-to-date concepts and skills, helping participan­ts to keep their current job or move to another industry or position. National University of Singapore’s We are constantly updating the curriculum to cope with the newest challenges posed to organisati­ons such as sustainabi­lity goals, responsibl­e innovation, or ethical considerat­ions.
ESSEC professors also teach company-specific programmes or act as consultant­s to companies so they are on the pulse with the latest industry trends, and deal with recent business Institute of Systems Science
