    <p>SAINT-MARTIN-VESUBIE • French and Ital­ian res­cue ser­vices have stepped up their search ef­forts af­ter floods cut off sev­eral vil­lages in the moun­tain­ous bor­der re­gions, caus­ing wide­spread dam­age and killing three peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Eight peo­ple re­mained un­ac­counted for on the French side of the bor­der af­ter storms, tor­ren­tial rain and flash floods bat­tered the area, wash­ing away roads and houses, cut­ting off en­tire vil­lages and trig­ger­ing land­slips.</p>
    <p>In Breil-sur-Roya, a French vil­lage close to the Ital­ian bor­der, houses were buried in mud and turned-over cars were stuck in the river bed.</p>
    <p>Res­cue ef­forts yes­ter­day were con­cen­trated on the Roya val­ley where about 1,000 fire­fight­ers, backed by he­li­copters and the army, re­sumed their search for sur­vivors and helped peo­ple whose homes were de­stroyed or in­ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Storm Alex bar­relled into France’s west coast last Thurs­day, bring­ing pow­er­ful winds and rain across the coun­try, be­fore mov­ing into north­ern Italy.</p>
    <p>Italy con­firmed that two peo­ple died on Satur­day – a vol­un­teer fire­fighter on a res­cue op­er­a­tion and a man whose car was washed away.</p>
    <p>France suf­fered its first fa­tal­ity yes­ter­day – a shep­herd whose body was pulled from a river near the bor­der.</p>
    <p>It has de­clared the re­gion a nat­u­ral dis­as­ter zone.</p>
    <p>Saint-Martin-Vesubie, a French vil­lage that is home to 1,400 peo­ple and lo­cated north of Nice, was com­pletely cut off by the storm.</p>
    <p>A bedrag­gled group of tourists and res­i­dents gath­ered in the vil­lage square to be air­lifted to safety, an AFPTV jour­nal­ist said af­ter reach­ing the site on foot.</p>
    <p>“My three-storey house, it’s in the river,” said vil­lager San­dra Dzidt, 62, who had to flee the floods dressed only in her night­gown.</p>
    <p>“All I have left is a tiny piece of wall and a door.”</p>
    <p>Across the re­gion, emer­gency crews were hand­ing out food and air­lift­ing thou­sands of bot­tles of wa­ter into re­mote vil­lages cut off by the storms.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dents of Italy’s Pied­mont and Lig­uria re­gions signed a joint let­ter call­ing on the gov­ern­ment to de­clare a state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is very se­ri­ous. It is like it was in 1994”, when 70 peo­ple died af­ter the Po and Tarano rivers flooded, Pied­mont pres­i­dent Al­berto Cirio told La Stampa news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>“The dif­fer­ence be­ing 630mm of wa­ter fell in 24 hours – un­prece­dented in such a small time frame since 1954.”</p>
