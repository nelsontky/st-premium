        Insight | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 23, 2020 | B10 Kevin Roose If you’re spending a lot of time online these days – and thanks to the pandemic, many of us are – you’ve probably heard of QAnon, the sprawling Internet conspiracy theory that has taken hold among some of President Donald Trump’s supporters.
But unless you’re very online, you likely still have questions about what exactly is going on.
QAnon was once a fringe phenomenon – the kind most people could safely ignore. But in recent months, it’s gone mainstream. Twitter, Facebook and other social networks have been flooded with QAnonrelat­ed false i nformation about Covid-19, the Black Lives Matter protests and the 2020 election. QAnon supporters have also been trying to attach themselves to other activist causes, such as the anti-vaccine and anti-child traffickin­g movements, in an effort to expand their ranks.
QAnon has also seeped into the offline world, with some believers charged with violent crimes, including one QAnon follower accused of murdering a mafia boss in New York last year and another who was arrested in April and accused of threatenin­g to kill Mr Joe Biden, the Democratic presidenti­al nominee. The FBI has warned that QAnon poses a potential domestic terror threat.
Earlier this month, QAnon reached a new milestone when Ms Marjorie Taylor Greene, an avowed QAnon supporter from Georgia, won a Republican primary in a heavily conservati­ve district, setting her up for a near-certain election to Congress in November. After her win, Mr Trump called her a “future Republican star”. QAnon is an incredibly convoluted theory, and you could fill an entire book explaining its various tributarie­s and subtheorie­s. But here are some basic things you should know. PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY .
