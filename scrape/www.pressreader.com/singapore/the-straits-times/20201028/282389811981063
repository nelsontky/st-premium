    <p>Three home-grown game stu­dios joined forces for the first time to launch a gam­ing cross­over yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mighty Bear Games, Bat­tleBrew Pro­duc­tions and The Gentle­bros are be­hind the hit mo­bile games But­ter Royale, Bat­tleSky Brigade Har­pooner and Cat Quest II re­spec­tively. Th­ese games are fam­i­lyfriendly and can be played on multiple de­vices.</p>
    <p>In the cross­over, play­ers of one game can un­lock and use char­ac­ters and weapons from the other games. The cross­over el­e­ments have no ex­piry date.</p>
    <p>The stu­dios are hop­ing to unite Sin­ga­pore­ans and up­lift spir­its through gam­ing in th­ese try­ing times.</p>
    <p>The cross­over idea was ini­ti­ated by Mr Fadzuli Said, co-founder and chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer of Mighty Bear Games, which launched food fight game But­ter Royale in Jan­uary this year.</p>
    <p>“This year has been re­ally tough for ev­ery­body be­cause of the pan­demic. Peo­ple are stuck at home and some have lost loved ones,” says the 38-year-old, who adds that his fa­ther died this year due to a pre-ex­ist­ing heart con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“When I was younger, play­ing games with my sis­ter was kind of an es­cape for us, so I wanted to share this good feel­ing with oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>He roped in fel­low Sin­ga­porean game de­vel­op­ers and long-time friends Shawn Toh and Des­mond Wong.</p>
    <p>Mr Toh, 35, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Bat­tleBrew Pro­duc­tions, says: “We have known one another for years and I like them both per­son­ally and pro­fes­sion­ally. It is a good ini­tia­tive, so why not?”</p>
    <p>His com­pany’s Bat­tleSky Brigade Har­pooner shoot-’em-up game was re­leased in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, 32, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of The Gentle­bros, shares the sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>“We thought it would be great if we could do a col­lab­o­ra­tion to show Sin­ga­pore­ans that great games can come from our small coun­try,” he says.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the col­lab­o­ra­tion was firmed up at the end of March, the trio tried to in­cor­po­rate el­e­ments of one another’s games.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong says: “For us, we al­ready have a story (with Cat Quest II). So if we are go­ing to do a cross­over, we have to make sure the stuff that is cross­ing over makes sense and fits into our story and style.”</p>
    <p>Cat Quest II was re­leased in Septem­ber last year on Ap­ple Ar­cade, be­fore be­com­ing avail­able on some other plat­forms.</p>
    <p>But t hat was the fun part, Mr Fadzuli notes. “I think the artists had a lot of fun, just com­ing up with all sorts of ideas.”</p>
    <p>While find­ing the right weapons or game­play me­chan­ics in the other games to fit their own was a chal­lenge, the big­gest prob­lem they faced was sched­ul­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Toh says: “We have dif­fer­ent de­vel­op­ment speeds, goals, patch cy­cles and so on.”</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal launch date for the cross­over was set in Au­gust to co­in­cide with Na­tional Day. But due to sched­ul­ing is­sues, it was de­layed un­til now.</p>
    <p>The com­mon thing the three games share is they are all on Ap­ple Ar­cade, which means they can be played on the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Ap­ple TV. The Cu­per­tino tech gi­ant’s gam­ing ser­vice has a monthly sub­scrip­tion fee of $6.98 af­ter a one-month free trial.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ers say Ap­ple did not have di­rect in­put in the col­lab­o­ra­tion, though it did give them its bless­ings.</p>
    <p>The trio are open to the idea of team­ing up again.</p>
    <p>“We will see how it goes. It is a rather fluid process, but we are def­i­nitely open to it,” says Mr Toh.</p>
