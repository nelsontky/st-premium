    <p>For ex­am­ple, an ac­ci­dent caused by a self-driv­ing car’s AI sys­tem could be due to a bug in the sys­tem’s soft­ware, or even an un­usual sit­u­a­tion such as a mon­i­tor lizard cross­ing the road that the sys­tem has not been trained to recog­nise.</p>
    <p>Who should be held legally re­spon­si­ble when a self-driv­ing car hits a pedes­trian? Should the fin­ger be pointed at the car owner, man­u­fac­turer or the de­vel­op­ers of the ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) soft­ware that drives the car?</p>
    <p>Strug­gles to as­sign li­a­bil­ity for ac­ci­dents in­volv­ing bleed­ing-edge tech­nolo­gies like AI have dom­i­nated global con­ver­sa­tions even as tri­als are on­go­ing in many places around the globe in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore, South Korea and Europe.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the third an­nual edi­tion of the TechLaw. Fest fo­rum last Wed­nes­day, pan­el­lists said that Sin­ga­pore’s laws are cur­rently un­able to ef­fec­tively as­sign li­a­bil­ity in the case of losses or harm suf­fered in ac­ci­dents in­volv­ing AI or robotics tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“The unique abil­ity of au­ton­o­mous ro­bots and AI sys­tems to op­er­ate in­de­pen­dently with­out any hu­man in­volve­ment mud­dies the wa­ters of li­a­bil­ity,” said par­lia­men­tary coun­sel and chief knowl­edge of­fi­cer of the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers Charles Lim.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing in a we­bi­nar ti­tled “Why Robot? Li­a­bil­ity for AI sys­tem fail­ures”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim is co-chair of the Sin­ga­pore Academy of Law’s 11-mem­ber Robotics and Ar­ti­fi­cial In­tel­li­gence Sub-com­mit­tee, which last month pub­lished a report on what can be done to es­tab­lish civil li­a­bil­ity in such cases.</p>
    <p>“There are mul­ti­ple fac­tors (in play) such as the AI sys­tem’s un­der­ly­ing soft­ware code, the data it was trained on, and the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment the sys­tem is de­ployed in,” he said.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, an ac­ci­dent caused by a self-driv­ing car’s AI sys­tem could be due to a bug in the sys­tem’s soft­ware, or even an un­usual sit­u­a­tion such as a mon­i­tor lizard cross­ing the road that the sys­tem has not been trained to recog­nise.</p>
    <p>A hu­man’s de­ci­sions could still in­flu­ence events lead­ing up to an ac­ci­dent too, as ex­ist­ing self-driv­ing cars have a man­ual mode that al­lows a hu­man driver to take con­trol.</p>
    <p>A soft­ware up­date ap­plied by the AI sys­tem’s de­vel­op­ers could also in­tro­duce new, un­fore­seen bugs.</p>
    <p>This makes re­trac­ing ev­ery step of an AI sys­tem’s de­ci­sion-mak­ing process to prove li­a­bil­ity a com­plex and costly task, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>Fel­low pan­el­list and robotics and AI sub-com­mit­tee mem­ber Josh Lee said a first step for law­mak­ers here could be to fig­ure out what to call the per­son be­hind the wheel.</p>
    <p>“We pro­pose that the per­son be called a ‘user-in-charge’, be­cause he or she may not be car­ry­ing out the task of driv­ing, but re­tains the abil­ity to take over when nec­es­sary,” he said. “This can have ap­pli­ca­tion be­yond driver­less ve­hi­cles... in many sce­nar­ios to­day, such as med­i­cal di­ag­no­sis.”</p>
    <p>The term “user-in-charge” was first mooted by the United King­dom Law Com­mis­sion in 2018, where pro­pos­als were tabled to put such users in a fully au­to­mated en­vi­ron­ment un­der a sep­a­rate reg­u­la­tory regime.</p>
    <p>AI and robotics sub-com­mit­tee mem­ber and lawyer Bev­erly Lim said dur­ing the we­bi­nar that the one per­son who should not be held li­able is the driver be­hind the wheel, be­cause he would have bought the ve­hi­cle think­ing the AI would be a com­par­a­tively more re­li­able driver.</p>
    <p>But the big­gest is­sue aris­ing from li­a­bil­ity in­volv­ing robotics and AI is en­sur­ing that vic­tims will be able to get com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, how are they sup­posed to prove (li­a­bil­ity) when they don’t have ac­cess to the data, or might not un­der­stand it?” said Ms Lim, a Jus­tices’ Law Clerk at the Supreme Court of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
