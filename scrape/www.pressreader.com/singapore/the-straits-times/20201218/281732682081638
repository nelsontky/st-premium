    <p>Ja­pan called up sol­diers from the Self-De­fence Forces yes­ter­day to help with dis­as­ter re­lief, as a cold air mass dumped heavy snow across wide ar­eas of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 ve­hi­cles were stranded on two ex­press­ways, and over 10,000 house­holds ex­pe­ri­enced power out­ages, the gov­ern­ment and po­lice said.</p>
    <p>At least one per­son died. Ms Mayuko Mi­hori, a 33-year-old from Tokyo, was snow­board­ing in the pop­u­lar ski re­sort of Yuzawa in Ni­igata pre­fec­ture when she fell and was buried un­der fresh snow in a heavy bliz­zard.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral towns, in­clud­ing Shin-on­sen and Kami in Hyogo pre­fec­ture and Wakasa and Yazu in Tot­tori pre­fec­ture, were iso­lated, with roads blocked be­cause of fallen trees and avalanches. Sev­eral roofs had also col­lapsed un­der the weight of ac­cu­mu­lated snow in Ishikawa pre­fec­ture.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga con­vened a dis­as­ter re­lief task force meet­ing yes­ter­day, call­ing for ut­most vig­i­lance against traf­fic dis­rup­tions and dam­age to fa­cil­i­ties due to the heavy snow­fall.</p>
    <p>The Ja­pan Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Agency has warned that heavy snow­fall will likely con­tinue in many ar­eas along the coast of the Sea of Ja­pan (also known as the East Sea) through to­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga ap­proved Ni­igata Gov­er­nor Hideyo Hanazumi’s re­quest for mil­i­tary back-up, with sol­diers be­ing called in to help dis­trib­ute sup­plies, clear snow, as­cer­tain the safety of res­i­dents, and res­cue stranded mo­torists trapped i n their stalled ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>About 1,100 ve­hi­cles were stuck overnight on Wed­nes­day on the Kan-etsu Ex­press­way, which con­nects Tokyo with Ni­igata pre­fec­ture in the north-west.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tor East Nip­pon Ex­press­way es­ti­mated a grid­lock ex­tend­ing 15km in both di­rec­tions as of last night, with mil­i­tary res­cue op­er­a­tions com­pli­cated by low vis­i­bil­ity and bliz­zard-like con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Driv­ers were be­ing asked to stay pa­tient as they hun­kered down in their stalled ve­hi­cles for a sec­ond sleep­less night yes­ter­day, while fear­ing for their lives.</p>
    <p>News re­ports said many are melt­ing snow for drink­ing wa­ter as they await sup­plies from the mil­i­tary, while East Nip­pon Ex­press­way is help­ing to dis­trib­ute petrol and toi­letries.</p>
    <p>One woman in her 30s was taken to hospi­tal af­ter she com­plained of breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoshi­nobu Wakiya, 46, told the Asahi Shim­bun yes­ter­day that it was a “life-or-death sit­u­a­tion”. He said he had to keep re­mov­ing snow from his car’s ex­haust pipe to pre­vent car­bon monox­ide fumes from build­ing up in his ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>A cold air mass has caused the mer­cury lev­els to fall, with more than 600 weather points across the coun­try record­ing the sea­son’s low­est tem­per­a­tures, the Ja­pan Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Agency said. Snow ac­cu­mu­lated in cen­tral Ky­oto – a rare event – while Tokyo’s tem­per­a­tures fell be­low 0 deg C yes­ter­day.</p>
