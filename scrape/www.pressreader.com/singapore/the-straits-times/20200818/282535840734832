    <p>Like ev­ery­one else, Jeff Kin­ney has been strug­gling with work­ing from home dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can au­thor of the best-sell­ing Di­ary Of A Wimpy Kid se­ries has an un­usual so­lu­tion: He drives to the ceme­tery and writes there in­stead.</p>
    <p>“It’s a place where there’s peace and quiet and no­body re­ally both­ers me,” says the 49-year-old over Skype.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing lock­down, he man­aged to fin­ish a screen­play for a Dis­ney+ an­i­mated fea­ture and the man­u­script of a new book.</p>
    <p>“When I started writ­ing, it was cold, so I sat in my car, put a blan­ket on my lap and tried to write on my iPad.”</p>
    <p>He says with a chuckle: “It’s an un­usual place to try to write com­edy.”</p>
    <p>Kin­ney lives in Plainville, Mas­sachusetts, with his wife Julie and their two teenage sons.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, he keeps a gru­elling, year-long sched­ule that has to run like clock­work. It in­cludes two months of glo­be­trot­ting for book tours and two months where he draws for 16 hours a day.</p>
    <p>This has en­abled him to put out a new book ev­ery year for his wildly pop­u­lar chil­dren’s se­ries, in which self-im­por­tant tween Greg Hef­fley re­counts his daily ad­ven­tures through di­ary en­tries and doo­dles.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has very much slowed things down, though this has al­lowed him to spend more time with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“In a way, it has given us the gift of time,” he says. “I learnt that I was mov­ing too fast and that things were mov­ing too fast for my fam­ily. My son’s only a year away from go­ing to col­lege. It was nice to get off the train.”</p>
    <p>He also learnt to value his book­store, An Un­likely Story, which he and his wife run in Plainville – and which, like book­stores around the world, had to stay shut dur­ing lock­down.</p>
    <p>“Now that it’s been taken away, I can see how badly our com­mu­nity needs it. So I’d re­ally like to get back and open it up again, draw­ing crowds of peo­ple when it’s safe.”</p>
    <p>Kin­ney is now back on the road, hav­ing em­barked on a so­cially dis­tanced book tour for his lat­est book, Rowley Jef­fer­son’s Awe­some Friendly Ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>This in­volves him driv­ing a van to in­de­pen­dent book­stores across the United States and hand­ing out books to kids, us­ing a 2.4m gizmo shaped like a tri­dent.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing the first day of his tour, he says: “It was on a re­ally busy street cor­ner in New York City. Ev­ery so of­ten, a per­son would walk by on the street and I’d have to wait to use my tri­dent to grab the next book. It was messy, hot and fun.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “The kids were re­ally happy. We’re liv­ing in a weird time when ev­ery­body’s wear­ing masks so I’m not see­ing their faces, but I can hear their voices and some­times you can tell when some­one’s smil­ing with their eyes.”</p>
    <p>Kin­ney’s books have sold 250 mil­lion copies world­wide and are a reg­u­lar fix­ture on The Straits Times’ weekly chil­dren’s best­seller lists.</p>
    <p>A multi-mil­lion­aire, he was named one of Time mag­a­zine’s 100 most in­flu­en­tial peo­ple in 2009.</p>
    <p>A former com­puter pro­gram­mer, Kin­ney be­gan pub­lish­ing Greg’s ad­ven­tures on FunBrain, a chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tional web­site he man­aged, in 2004. By 2007, the se­ries had been picked up for print and his first book, which took him nearly eight years to bring to light, was an in­stant hit.</p>
    <p>Greg, an ar­ro­gant, un-ath­letic kid try­ing to nav­i­gate the mine­field of mid­dle school, is partly based on Kin­ney’s own childhood. In con­trast, Greg’s best friend Rowley is sweet and imag­i­na­tive, if not very bright.</p>
    <p>Rowley’s per­spec­tive takes cen­tre stage in Di­ary Of An Awe­some Friendly Kid (2019), which came about when publisher Scholas­tic asked Kin­ney to write a 50-page story for school­child­ren in the US, and then World Book Day or­gan­is­ers in Bri­tain asked him to dou­ble that.</p>
    <p>“I liked (Rowley’s) voice,” he says. “I love writ­ing Di­ary Of A Wimpy Kid books, but they’re very tech­ni­cal and there’s a tem­plate for them, whereas there isn’t for the Rowley books, so I feel like I can go in just about any di­rec­tion with those.”</p>
    <p>Rowley Jef­fer­son’s Awe­some Friendly Ad­ven­ture is “a story that feels like an epic fan­tasy, but it’s writ­ten from a place of pure imag­i­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>Kin­ney has just fin­ished the man­u­script for the 15th Wimpy Kid book, The Deep End, which will be re­leased in Oc­to­ber. “I’ve done about two-thirds of the sketches and from now un­til the end of Au­gust, I’ll just be draw­ing like mad.”</p>
    <p>He de­scribes it as “Covid-19ad­ja­cent”. The book starts off with a fam­ily quar­an­tined in their grand­mother’s base­ment be­cause their house is be­ing ren­o­vated.</p>
    <p>“The fam­ily go through all of the beats that fam­i­lies are go­ing through right now – the feel­ing of be­ing to­gether in close quar­ters, not be­ing able to see your friends, the par­ents are work­ing at home.</p>
    <p>“But it doesn’t ad­dress Covid-19 head on. I think that kids will be tired of hear­ing about Covid-19. I think it’s inescapabl­e right now.</p>
    <p>“Also, I want a kid pick­ing up one of my books 10 years from now, to feel the book is still rel­e­vant. I didn’t want to put a stamp on this mo­ment in time. I re­ally like my books to feel time­less.”</p>
