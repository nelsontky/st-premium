    <p>Three chil­dren from a pre-school in New­ton were hos­pi­talised fol­low­ing an out­break of sal­mo­nella and stom­ach flu among its charges aged be­tween 18 months and six years old.</p>
    <p>One of them was dis­charged yes­ter­day, said the Early Child­hood Devel­op­ment Agency (ECDA) in a state­ment last night.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said it is work­ing with the Health Min­istry on the case at Kid­di­winkie School­house @ New­ton.</p>
    <p>The cause of the out­break has yet to be de­ter­mined.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, a school cir­cu­lar to par­ents seen by The Straits Times said, as of yes­ter­day, there were four cases of sal­mo­nella and 18 cases of stom­ach flu.</p>
    <p>The cases have been re­ported to the ECDA, and the cir­cu­lar as­sured par­ents that the cen­tre will be dis­in­fected daily.</p>
    <p>Eat­ing food con­tam­i­nated with the bac­te­ria Sal­mo­nella en­ter­i­tidis can cause di­ar­rhoea, fever, vom­it­ing and ab­dom­i­nal cramps, com­monly known as food poi­son­ing.</p>
    <p>A sal­mo­nella in­fec­tion can be fa­tal for young chil­dren, the el­derly and those with im­paired im­mune sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Stom­ach flu is caused by the norovirus which in­flames the stom­ach and in­testines. Com­mon symp­toms in­clude di­ar­rhoea and vom­it­ing.</p>
    <p>A 39-year-old par­ent, who de­clined to be named, said her two chil­dren are down with food poi­son­ing. Her four-year-old had a fever and started vom­it­ing last Fri­day. Her two-year-old showed symp­toms of fever and di­ar­rhoea the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>She knows of at least 16 cases of food poi­son­ing or stom­ach flu in the pre-school, in­clud­ing her kids.</p>
    <p>“There are five chil­dren who got sick in my con­do­minium es­tate, an­other 10 in a con­do­minium nearby and one more who is my friend’s child,” added the mother of two who works in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor.</p>
    <p>She fur­ther said she wished the pre-school had shown greater ur­gency in dis­clos­ing the out­break.</p>
    <p>“The first cir­cu­lar was sent only on Mon­day, a few days after my chil­dren had fallen ill. I ini­tially thought my child’s fever and lethargy were brought about by the cold weather but it was much more se­ri­ous. I would have acted sooner had I known about the out­break,” she added.</p>
    <p>An­other par­ent, who also asked not to be named, said his three­year-old son had stom­ach flu on Satur­day. “He had fever above 39 deg C, se­vere stom­ach pain and vom­it­ing, so we took him to the hos­pi­tal,” said the 43-year-old bank ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>He said he knows of seven chil­dren in dif­fer­ent classes who have fallen ill. “The school could have man­aged the out­break more trans­par­ently... When I called them to un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion, they told me not to speak to other par­ents about it be­cause they didn’t want to alarm them.</p>
    <p>“But I think more par­ents need to know about it ear­lier so they can pro­tect their chil­dren,” he added.</p>
    <p>When ST was at the school yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, a woman who iden­ti­fied her­self as its cen­tre man­ager de­clined to com­ment.</p>
