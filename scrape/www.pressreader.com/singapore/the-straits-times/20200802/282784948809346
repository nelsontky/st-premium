    <p>Six­teen min­utes after news broke that the coron­avirus pan­demic had led to Amer­ica’s sharpest eco­nomic con­trac­tion in modern his­tory, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump made an ex­tra­or­di­nary sug­ges­tion to de­lay the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The idea was swiftly shot down by al­lies of Mr Trump, who had played up – with­out any ev­i­dence – the spec­tre of vot­ing-by-mail fraud.</p>
    <p>Only Con­gress, and not the pres­i­dent, has the power to change the date of the elec­tion, which is set by law. But the episode last Thurs­day high­lighted two key im­pacts of the coron­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>First, it showed just how much the gov­ern­ment’s mis­han­dling of the cri­sis has re­versed the elec­tion for­tunes of Mr Trump, who went from rid­ing the highs of a strong econ­omy in Jan­uary to fac­ing a tough re-elec­tion now.</p>
    <p>A pres­i­dent who thinks he is win­ning would not call for elec­tions to be post­poned or seek to cast doubt on the le­git­i­macy of the out­come, po­lit­i­cal watch­ers pointed out.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it showed how Covid-19 may have cre­ated the con­di­tions for the elec­tion’s le­git­i­macy to be un­der­mined, po­ten­tially lead­ing to chaos in the elec­tion af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>TRUMP OR BI­DEN?</p>
    <p>Polls con­sis­tently show that the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of Covid-19 has sig­nif­i­cantly hurt Mr Trump’s re-elec­tion chances, although it re­mains to be seen how the is­sue will ac­tu­ally play out with vot­ers at the end of the day.</p>
    <p>The fum­bled re­sponse in the ini­tial stage of the cri­sis was shock­ing, with the fed­eral gov­ern­ment blamed for na­tion­wide short­ages of personal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE), ven­ti­la­tors and other med­i­cal equip­ment, and leav­ing ev­ery state fend­ing for it­self to buy PPE and test­ing kits.</p>
    <p>Now, the virus’ resur­gence in Sun Belt states, in­clud­ing red states like Ari­zona and swing states like Florida, as well as its con­tin­ued spread be­yond met­ro­pol­i­tan cities to the sub­urbs, may hit Mr Trump harder.</p>
    <p>The US death toll from the virus sur­passed 150,000 on Fri­day, as daily fa­tal­ity fig­ures in­creased again last month after pre­vi­ously de­clin­ing.</p>
    <p>“Trump has called him­self a wartime pres­i­dent,” said Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Lynn Vavreck.</p>
    <p>“Just like pres­i­dents who fight a war suf­fer when ca­su­al­ties of war hap­pen in lo­cal ar­eas, the same thing is hap­pen­ing for Trump and Repub­li­cans with Covid.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Vavreck co-helms the Na­tion­scape project, which tracks pub­lic opin­ion on key elec­tion is­sues over time and has con­ducted over 320,000 in­ter­views in 3,025 coun­ties across the US in the past year.</p>
    <p>Her re­search shows that as deaths in­crease in a county, peo­ple’s ap­proval of Mr Trump goes down and they be­come less will­ing to say they will vote for him in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>A dou­bling of Covid-19 deaths in a county in­creases the gap be­tween Mr Trump and his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den by 0.3 per­cent­age point, said Prof Vavreck last Tues­day at a Stan­ford Uni­ver­sity sem­i­nar on the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>This dif­fer­ence is small but po­ten­tially crit­i­cal, con­sid­er­ing Mr Trump won the swing states of Michi­gan, Wis­con­sin and Penn­syl­va­nia by less than a per­cent­age point in 2016, she said.</p>
    <p>“I see the 2020 elec­tion as shap­ing up as be­ing largely about a per­for­mance eval­u­a­tion of Trump for his han­dling of Covid. It’s a missed op­por­tu­nity for him and a lucky turn for Joe Bi­den,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s sug­ges­tions at a Covid-19 brief­ing in April that ul­tra­vi­o­let light and dis­in­fec­tant – which could be in­jected into pa­tients – could be used in treat­ment were also po­lit­i­cally dam­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Prof Vavreck noted that dur­ing the pan­demic, more Repub­li­cans thought Mr Trump re­lies on his hunches with­out check­ing facts, with their num­bers spik­ing after his com­ments on in­ject­ing dis­in­fec­tant.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­cently restarted his Covid-19 brief­ings and en­cour­aged Amer­i­cans to wear masks, a de­ci­sion based on cal­cu­la­tions that he could neu­tralise crit­i­cisms of his ear­lier han­dling of the cri­sis by chang­ing his tone.</p>
    <p>But his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s push to re­open schools de­spite the virus’ resur­gence across the Sun Belt, as well as the heavy dam­age that has been dealt to the econ­omy, sug­gests that the virus and its eco­nomic ef­fects will con­tinue into au­tumn, with not enough be­ing done to sup­press its trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>His more se­ri­ous ap­proach to the virus is also likely tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>He has con­tin­ued to spread mis­in­for­ma­tion about the virus, most re­cently pro­mot­ing the tweets of a con­spir­acy the­o­rist doc­tor who said masks were not needed to pre­vent Covid-19 from spread­ing.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Vavreck: “Un­less Repub­li­cans be­gin to co­or­di­nate and de­velop some in­sti­tu­tions to deal with the pan­demic... our data sug­gests that vot­ers will hold them ac­count­able.”</p>
    <p>VOT­ING BY MAIL AND THE CA­PAC­ITY FOR CHAOS</p>
    <p>TRUMP UN­DER SCRU­TINY</p>
    <p>I see the 2020 elec­tion as shap­ing up as be­ing largely about a per­for­mance eval­u­a­tion of Trump for his han­dling of Covid. It’s a missed op­por­tu­nity for him and a lucky turn for ’’</p>
    <p>Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR LYNN VAVRECK, Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist, who co-helms the Na­tion­scape project, which tracks pub­lic opin­ion on key elec­tion is­sues over time and has con­ducted more than 320,000 in­ter­views in 3,025 coun­ties across the US in the past year.</p>
    <p>Coron­avirus wor­ries are also push­ing a record num­ber of peo­ple to vote by mail, ac­cel­er­at­ing a trend that be­gan before the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, vot­ing by mail is not in­her­ently par­ti­san and does not ben­e­fit one party over the other, said Stan­ford Uni­ver­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist An­drew Hall.</p>
    <p>He stud­ied data from 1996 to 2018 on three states that mailed ev­ery voter a bal­lot.</p>
    <p>“It’s a re­mark­ably neu­tral pol­icy,” he said. “It did not boost Demo­cratic turnout rel­a­tive to Repub­li­can turnout, and it did not boost the Demo­cratic Party’s vote share over the Repub­li­can Party’s in any ob­serv­able way.”</p>
    <p>But the na­tional con­ver­sa­tion over mea­sures to en­sure safe vot­ing has be­come politi­cised, with Repub­li­cans op­pos­ing their more wide­spread use for se­cu­rity reasons, and Democrats push­ing for them and ac­cus­ing Repub­li­cans of want­ing to de­press voter turnout.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Hall said he could not rule out that vot­ing by mail could come to ad­van­tage one party over the other dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis, when vot­ers of the two par­ties might have very dif­fer­ent views on</p>
    <p>the safety of vot­ing in per­son.</p>
    <p>But who ben­e­fits from this par­ti­san­ship is un­clear.</p>
    <p>The coron­avirus has also raised the pos­si­bil­ity of a per­fect storm of ad­min­is­tra­tive mis­steps and strained elec­tion in­fra­struc­ture that could fuel per­cep­tions that the elec­tion out­come is il­le­git­i­mate, said some po­lit­i­cal watch­ers.</p>
    <p>Bren­nan Centre for Jus­tice pres­i­dent Michael Wald­man, a for­mer as­sis­tant to then Pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton, wrote in an on­line com­men­tary on vot­ing risks: “We’ve never had such a flood of in­ter­est in vote by mail. Too many states are sim­ply not yet ready to make it work.”</p>
    <p>States are rac­ing against the clock to ex­pand all-mail vot­ing, but the ad­min­is­tra­tive chaos in primary polls in Ge­or­gia, Wis­con­sin and other states ear­lier this year raised fears that sim­i­lar break­downs may hap­pen in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has also de­manded that the re­sults be known on elec­tion night it­self, even though that is lo­gis­ti­cally al­most im­pos­si­ble, given this year’s spike in mail-in bal­lots, which take longer to count.</p>
    <p>An un­prece­dent­edly large “blue shift” could also hap­pen if more Repub­li­cans vote in per­son and more Democrats vote by mail.</p>
    <p>As mail bal­lots are counted later, Mr Bi­den’s odds could sub­se­quently im­prove even if Mr Trump leads at first on elec­tion night.</p>
    <p>These de­lays or shifts in re­port­ing re­sults, par­tic­u­larly of close con­tests in bat­tle­ground states, may lead Amer­i­cans primed to be­lieve in vot­ing fraud to con­clude that the elec­tion is be­ing rigged.</p>
    <p>The Eura­sia Group po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy con­cluded ear­lier this year that a top risk for 2020 was that this year’s US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion could be per­ceived as il­le­git­i­mate.</p>
    <p>“Half­way through the year, it has be­come clear that the novel coron­avirus pan­demic has ex­ac­er­bated that risk by forc­ing dras­tic changes to how states con­duct both primary elec­tions and Novem­ber’s gen­eral elec­tion,” Eura­sia Group an­a­lysts wrote in a spe­cial re­port last month.</p>
    <p>These changes cre­ated an open­ing for pre-emp­tive ac­cu­sa­tions of vot­ing in­ter­fer­ence or out­right fraud, they said.</p>
    <p>“The up­shot is that no mat­ter who wins in Novem­ber, the los­ing side is likely to have in­ter­nalised a view that the elec­tion was in some way rigged against it, un­der­min­ing the po­lit­i­cal le­git­i­macy and po­ten­tially the le­gal va­lid­ity of the out­come,” they added.</p>
