    <p>Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) trainees have been us­ing a cus­tom-made smart­watch (right) since the mid­dle of last month in a trial run of the wear­able tech­nol­ogy. The smart­watch is one of sev­eral new tech­nol­ogy ini­tia­tives un­veiled by the SCDF last week.</p>
    <p>For the past month, Of­fi­cer Cadet Shin Won Tae has had a new “buddy” while train­ing in the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF).</p>
    <p>The “buddy” mon­i­tors his where­abouts and heart rate at all times dur­ing train­ing, and will send an alert if he has overex­erted him­self.</p>
    <p>OCT Shin, 27, and his fel­low trainees have been us­ing a cus­tom­made smart­watch since the mid­dle of last month in a trial run of the wear­able tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The smart­watch is one of sev­eral new tech­nol­ogy ini­tia­tives un­veiled by the SCDF last week.</p>
    <p>Quan­ti­ta­tive data will be col­lected from the smart­watch trial, and will be used to help the SCDF team an­a­lyse and op­ti­mise their train­ing per­for­mances, said Ma­jor Hasan Kud­doos, who is the act­ing head of the re­spon­der per­for­mance cen­tre at the Civil De­fence Academy.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, it’s more of a qual­i­ta­tive anal­y­sis; in­struc­tors have vis­ual cues on their train­ing safety and their train­ing per­for­mance, but go­ing for­ward we are try­ing to lever­age science and tech­nol­ogy to en­hance this,” Maj Hasan said dur­ing a show­case of the smart­watch.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in­struc­tors will be able to gauge if any cadet is over- or un­der-ex­ert­ing him­self dur­ing ex­er­cises, by look­ing at the cadet’s heart rate. The smart­watches also have a tracking sys­tem so train­ers know where their trainees are at all times.</p>
    <p>Home Team Science and Tech­nol­ogy Agency’s (HTX) Mr Ying Meng Fai, act­ing di­rec­tor of the hu­man fac­tors and sim­u­la­tion cen­tre of ex­per­tise, said: “With this smart tech­nol­ogy, you take away the hu­man... men­tal work­load: You don’t need to keep tracking the per­son; it’s ac­tu­ally all re­flected in the sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>If the cadet has overex­erted him­self, he can trig­ger a “man-down” alert on his watch, to let his trainer and his clos­est com­pa­triot know he is not well. The watches are also per­son­alised for each cadet, and OCT Shin said this helps them ob­jec­tively gauge when to ramp up or tone down their train­ing based on their own vi­tals. “In­stead of com­par­ing (my per­for­mance) with oth­ers, it’s re­ally just me against me,” he said.</p>
    <p>The watches will even­tu­ally have ad­di­tional fea­tures, like an au­to­matic at­ten­dance fea­ture, and will be rolled out to all front-line re­spon­ders pro­gres­sively, in­clud­ing those at the Pung­gol Fire Sta­tion, which has been des­ig­nated as the first Smart Fire Sta­tion, said Maj Hasan.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing fire sta­tion is ex­pected to be com­pleted next year, and will incorporat­e the use of more tech­nol­ogy in ev­ery­day op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, per­son­nel from the sta­tion will also use other wear­able tech­nol­ogy such as “smart glasses”. Front-lin­ers will be wear­ing the “glasses”, which will al­low for the stream­ing of video feed of ca­su­al­ties to med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als in hos­pi­tals, who can then ad­vise on steps for im­me­di­ate treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The sta­tion will also make use of other smart tech­nol­ogy like an au­to­mated duty ros­ter­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Aside from the Smart Fire Sta­tion, the SCDF is also de­vel­op­ing a re­search and devel­op­ment fa­cil­ity, known as Emer­gency Re­spon­ders’ Fit­ness Con­di­tion­ing and En­hance­ment Lab, to­gether with HTX.</p>
    <p>SCDF’s Deputy Com­mis­sioner for fu­ture tech­nol­ogy and pub­lic safety</p>
    <p>Teong How Hwa said lever­ag­ing such smart tech­nolo­gies is a key thrust of the SCDF’s trans­for­ma­tion, and will dras­ti­cally re­shape the way front-lin­ers are trained.</p>
    <p>“(This will en­able) us to op­ti­mise our per­son­nel’s per­for­mance and safety, to de­liver our mis­sion of pro­tect­ing and sav­ing lives and prop­erty more ef­fec­tively in this digital age.”</p>
