    <p>Anand – whose life is soon to be given a Bol­ly­wood makeover – has seen Pawn Sac­ri­fice (Spi­der­man’s Tobey Maguire stars as Bobby Fis­cher) and the “heart­warm­ing” Queen Of Katwe, but The Queen’s Gam­bit has en­thused even the greats. Per­haps be­cause in the pur­suit of drama, it has not been di­luted by in­au­then­tic­ity.</p>
    <p>Foot­ballers see spa­ces be­fore they open. Divers vi­su­alise their aerial art be­fore they launch them­selves. In the head of ath­letes, beau­ti­ful things are con­structed. Like in The Queen’s Gam­bit, the hit Net­flix mini-se­ries where Beth Har­mon looks at the ceil­ing and plots her way through a game on an imag­i­nary up­side-down board.</p>
    <p>Fan­tas­tic, huh? No, ac­tu­ally rather ba­sic for chess play­ers.</p>
    <p>Do you do a ver­sion of this, I ask Viswanatha­n Anand, the af­fa­ble, five-time world chess cham­pion?</p>
    <p>“All the time,” he po­litely replies. “I would say any­body who’s hit a de­cent club level has done a ver­sion of this. It’s to­tally un­re­mark­able within the chess world.</p>
    <p>“In fact one of the marks of a good player is not re­ally the way he moves his pieces, but also that when he reads a chess mag­a­zine he doesn’t bother to set up a board. You just use one or two di­a­grams to ori­ent your­self and you have the no­ta­tion and you just play the no­ta­tion in your head. You’ve got a board in your head, which is what you’re mov­ing.”</p>
    <p>Wel­come to chess, this black and white maze which has taken hold of a locked-down planet. One might say we’re all go­ing to pieces thanks to a fic­tional woman cham­pion of tal­ent and tran­quil­lis­ers.</p>
    <p>Like ev­ery sport, chess has been trans­lated onto screen with vary­ing de­grees of suc­cess. Anand – whose life is soon to be given a Bol­ly­wood makeover – has seen Pawn Sac­ri­fice (Spi­der­man’s Tobey Maguire stars as Bobby Fis­cher) and the “heart­warm­ing” Queen Of Katwe, but The Queen’s Gam­bit has en­thused even the greats. Per­haps be­cause in the pur­suit of drama, it has not been di­luted by in­au­then­tic­ity.</p>
    <p>“I can’t im­me­di­ately tell why this one was so wildly suc­cess­ful,” says Anand, “but it is bril­liant... There was a lot of at­ten­tion to de­tail. You know, we never had this chess player moment of say­ing, ‘oh god, that po­si­tion is il­le­gal while ev­ery­thing else is per­fect’. It was ex­tremely well done like that.</p>
    <p>“And there are a lot of hid­den ref­er­ences. That she picks up the game just by watch­ing the jan­i­tor, he doesn’t ac­tu­ally teach her. I think that might have been in­spired by (Jose Raul) Ca­pablanca (world cham­pion in the 1920s), who is ru­moured to have learnt the</p>
    <p>moves just by watch­ing his dad play with his dad’s friends.”</p>
    <p>This isn’t just a se­ries, it is a se­duc­tion. A 57-year-old friend, who can’t tell Kas­parov from Kar­pov, spent one night of her quar­an­tine in Sin­ga­pore joust­ing with a 10-year-old on­line. It’s as if a brief old flir­ta­tion with a</p>
    <p>64-square board has be­come a new ro­mance.</p>
    <p>“I think a lot of peo­ple have this feel­ing,” says Anand, “that they once stum­bled on chess in real life, they didn’t do much with the im­pulse, or maybe that spark wasn’t there, or they didn’t meet the right per­son who showed them how to play, like the jan­i­tor. That one thing was miss­ing.</p>
    <p>“It seems that a lot of peo­ple were cu­ri­ous about the game and The Queen’s Gam­bit has given a lot of peo­ple an ex­cuse to come back and ex­plore it. And you know, lo and be­hold, there is this on­line world where you can play a game in two sec­onds if you want. So the tim­ing worked in many ways. Maybe 20 years ago it wouldn’t have had the same ef­fect.”</p>
    <p>Talk­ing to Anand is a de­light be­cause it’s akin to de­con­struct­ing</p>
    <p>the Ali movie with Evan­der Holy­field. They just see things you can’t. So did his chess pals, all par­tic­u­lar folk, dis­cuss the se­ries and the games within it? Yes.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery chess player no­ticed. Ev­ery chess player again, while watch­ing the se­ries, with­out tak­ing a photo, re­mem­bered the po­si­tion, searched for it in his database and found the rel­e­vant games.</p>
    <p>“I re­alise I have ac­tu­ally been present at the hall when two of those games were played. (Har­mon’s) fi­nal game against (Vasily) Bor­gov (the world cham­pion in the se­ries) is ac­tu­ally (Vass­ily) Ivanchuk ver­sus (Pa­trick) Wolff in Switzer­land and I was there in that hall.”</p>
    <p>With­out stereo­typ­ing chess play­ers, on whom ac­cu­sa­tions of ec­cen­tric­ity are ca­su­ally draped, they can be fid­geters and star­ers in what is an in­tense pur­suit.</p>
    <p>“Yah, guilty, guilty,” laughs Anand. “I have done it my­self. Within 180 de­grees there are only so many places you can look. You stare at the chess­board, then you look to the side, and you look to the other side, and then you look</p>
    <p>op­po­site and there’s your op­po­nent sit­ting there and so you stare at them.</p>
    <p>“But the thing is, it’s very hard to just keep on star­ing at the chess­board. So you tend to look around ner­vously. All the time there is a board in your head as well. So that is typ­i­cal. Bit­ing your nails, fid­get­ing, ner­vously mov­ing your pen, stir­ring your tea, ev­ery kind of ma­nia I’m sure over the years some chess player or the other has ex­hib­ited it.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple need some out­let for that ner­vous en­ergy... while they’re wait­ing for their op­po­nent to move. That’s also very dif­fi­cult. Like I said, they’ve taken the trou­ble to make it look au­then­tic. They’ve clearly asked how chess play­ers sit and looked at footage and recre­ated that pretty well.”</p>
    <p>So go find your­self a board and in­vest in this clock-punch­ing game of end­less tac­ti­cal av­enues. Time, says Anand, does erode “the abil­ity to cal­cu­late clearly” and yet he knows age is no bar­rier to love af­fairs. Af­ter all, he is bril­liant proof of it. At 51, he’s world No. 15, prov­ing that great tal­ent en­dures and so does this sin­gu­lar game.</p>
