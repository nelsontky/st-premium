        HOME B5 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 2020 | | | A NATION’S PRIDE PROUD TO BE SINGAPOREA­N Over the last 55 years, Singapore’s achieved so much and I’m very proud to be Singaporea­n and to be part of this success. I hope that in the future, things will go even better for us. ’’ MR JAVIER LAI, 18, a polytechni­c student. SIGNIFICAN­T DAY This year’s NDP is significan­t for me as I get to witness the Red Lions parachute... and when I get home, I will get to spend time with my loved ones and sing along to the evening show with my five-year-old daughter. ’’ MS SITI AISYAH SAMSUDIN, 31, specialist outpatient clinics service team leader at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. HARMONY ON HER MIND When I think about Singapore, I think of racial harmony. This National Day is special to me because I can see people, even my neighbour, carrying my design on the NDP pack. ’’ MS ADELINE VEJALETCHM­Y, 58, an artist with the Singapore Associatio­n of the Visually Handicappe­d who created one of 20 designs for this year’s NDP packs. COMING TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE This year’s parade is special because we can still celebrate in the midst of a pandemic, with Singaporea­ns from different walks of life coming together in their own ways to celebrate the fact that Singapore is still going strong after 55 years. ’’ MS TAN HUILI, 38, secondary school teacher.
