    <p>More than 10,600 ben­e­fi­cia­ries of Yayasan Men­daki’s ter­tiary tu­ition fee sub­si­dies (TTFS) were given $43 mil­lion to pur­sue fur­ther stud­ies last year – an all-time high.</p>
    <p>The self-help group had spent $42 mil­lion un­der this scheme to sup­port 10,000 ben­e­fi­cia­ries in 2018.</p>
    <p>The scheme sub­sidises fees for el­i­gi­ble Malay stu­dents pur­su­ing their first diploma or de­gree at lo­cal govern­ment ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Men­daki re­leased its 2019 re­port yes­ter­day, show­ing that it dis­bursed $3.7 mil­lion in study loans and spent $32.3 mil­lion on com­mu­nity outreach. In to­tal, it sup­ported more than 91,000 ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs and Men­daki chair­man Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said in a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that the group recorded a sur­plus of $12.6 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it had to dip into its re­serves for the first time this year to spend $1.9 mil­lion, mainly on lap­tops for stu­dents dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and to help In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion stu­dents whose fam­ily in­come was af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos, who is also Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment, said even more TTFS funds would be dis­trib­uted this year, as ap­pli­ca­tions have re­opened and now in­clude those whose fam­ily in­come might have been af­fected ow­ing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We have not seen a surge yet. There are al­ready new ap­pli­ca­tions, but we fore­see that more TTFS will be dis­bursed next year too, and we are bud­get­ing for this,” said Mr Masa­gos.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter added that Men­daki will main­tain its fo­cus and con­tinue to en­cour­age chil­dren in the com­mu­nity to at­tend early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and De­fence Zaqy Mo­hamad, who is the group’s deputy chair­man, said at the press con­fer­ence that another pri­or­ity for Men­daki is sup­port­ing com­mu­nity mem­bers whose jobs were af­fected by Covid-19 dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>Men­daki has launched a ded­i­cated hot­line for job seek­ers and is work­ing with them via an app called Car­iKerja. It will con­tinue to share in­for­ma­tion on avail­able jobs with the com­mu­nity, said Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing with govern­ment agen­cies to link job seek­ers – in­clud­ing fresh grad­u­ates – with com­pa­nies look­ing to fill va­can­cies, as well as with train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties that could help them reskill to even­tu­ally gain em­ploy­ment.</p>
