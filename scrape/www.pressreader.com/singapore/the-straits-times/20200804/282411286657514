    <p>DIG­I­TAL TOURS</p>
    <p>The In­dian Her­itage Cen­tre (IHC) has in­tro­duced new dig­i­tal her­itage tours.</p>
    <p>Scan a QR code and you can down­load a dig­i­tal cu­ra­tor’s tour. The tour will high­light IHC cu­ra­tor Nalina Gopal’s top 10 picks at the mu­seum.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old names “star arte­facts” such as the Chola bronze of Nataraja, on loan from the Na­tional Mu­seum of In­dia; a ship’s bell bear­ing a Tamil in­scrip­tion point­ing to the pres­ence of pre-mod­ern Tamil di­as­po­ras in the Straits re­gion, on loan from New Zealand’s Te Papa mu­seum; and a dig­i­tal holo­gram of an 11th-cen­tury cop­per­plate grant from the col­lec­tion of the Lei­den Univer­sity li­brary, spe­cially pro­to­typed for the IHC.</p>
    <p>She says dig­i­tal tours are more con­ve­nient for visi­tors.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally, a vis­i­tor would have to reg­is­ter for cu­ra­tor’s tours, thereby plac­ing a lim­i­ta­tion on the num­ber of par­tic­i­pants who can hear from the cu­ra­tor on in­sights and ideas that went be­hind the mak­ing of the ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>“But through the dig­i­tal edi­tion, the pub­lic can ex­pe­ri­ence a cu­ra­tor’s tour when they are at the cen­tre on any given day.”</p>
    <p>She adds that th­ese dig­i­tal tours are a com­ple­ment to the IHC of­fer­ings, and once the sit­u­a­tion al­lows, the cu­ra­tors “have many sto­ries to tell and can’t wait to re­sume in­ter­ac­tions with visi­tors”.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>BRAS BASAH BUGIS LIGHT-UP</p>
    <p>Put on your walk­ing shoes and head to the civic district for an In­sta­gram-wor­thy tour.</p>
    <p>A sug­ges­tion is to start at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore’s rooftop for a view of the Es­planade’s sparkling lights, then set­tle down at the Padang with a pic­nic bas­ket to ad­mire the art pro­jec­tions at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore (see story on C2).</p>
    <p>You can drop by the Vic­to­ria The­atre & Con­cert Hall while head­ing to the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum, and swing by the Arts House on the way to Hill Street to check out the Cen­tral Fire Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>From there, it is a short hop to the Ar­me­nian Church be­fore the Cathe­dral Of The Good Shep­herd and Chi­jmes. Then you can walk on to the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore for the last stop of the evening.</p>
    <p>All the build­ings will be lit by 7.30pm every evening un­til Aug 30.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>ONE STORY: DHARMA’S CHAR­IOT</p>
    <p>This new project by the Na­tional Li­brary Board aims to share lo­cal short sto­ries writ­ten in Tamil, Malay, Chi­nese or English, in other lan­guages.</p>
    <p>The first story is by Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize win­ner Sithu­raj Pon­raj, ti­tled Dharma’s Char­iot. It tells of a cloth mer­chant strug­gling with guilt af­ter sell­ing a de­fec­tive ship­ment to an old friend to pay his shop rent. It has been trans­lated into Malay, Chi­nese and English and you can get a free copy at li­braries while stocks last.</p>
    <p>Af­ter read­ing the story, you might want to join book club dis­cus­sions at the li­braries which will be con­ducted in var­i­ous lan­guages.</p>
    <p>Go to str.sg/JnZV for de­tails.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>OF MUL­TI­TUDES AND MI­GRA­TION: LUMINATION 2020 The Arts House’s an­nual sea­son which fo­cuses on hid­den his­to­ries and un­told sto­ries takes its third edi­tion on­line this month. The theme is The Mi­gra­tion Edi­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­gram­mer Shri­dar Mani, 33, says: “The Mi­gra­tion Edi­tion re­minds us of how Sin­ga­pore’s nar­ra­tive is made up of the sto­ries of im­mi­grants both past and present, peo­ple who have played an im­por­tant role through­out the coun­try’s his­tory.”</p>
    <p>In the 15-minute video, Things We Cher­ish (str.sg/Jn4e), cu­rated by mi­grant poet Shivaji Das, meet mi­grant work­ers who share their ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Or find out more about the Baweanese com­mu­nity (above) in Sin­ga­pore in a se­ries of we­bisodes (str.sg/Jn4s) ti­tled Orang Phe­bien: The Baweanese In Sin­ga­pore.</p>

    <p>5</p>
    <p>SOUNDSCAPE­SG</p>
    <p>Be­come a ci­ti­zen archivist and help doc­u­ment uniquely Sin­ga­pore sounds.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Archives Of Sin­ga­pore, which is part of the Na­tional Li­brary Board, is launch­ing an ef­fort from to­mor­row to col­lect snip­pets of Sin­ga­pore’s sound­scape. It is look­ing for record­ings of ev­ery­thing from lo­cal di­alects to am­bi­ent tracks of neigh­bour­hood scenes such as ko­pi­ti­ams and void decks to fes­tive cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Sign up at str.sg/JnZn to share your record­ings and se­lected files will be pinned on the site’s in­ter­ac­tive map.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>@HOME, TRULY: A DIG­I­TAL EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>Join nine-year-old Na­dine and Hock Seng, her beloved Gong Gong (Man­darin for ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther), as they chat about his­toric mo­ments in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory. Their con­ver­sa­tions will un­fold on Roots.sg as a se­ries of il­lus­tra­tions by home-grown tal­ent.</p>
    <p>You can also play games and quizzes with an in­ter­ac­tive chat­bot named Chat­bird on the site.</p>
    <p>This dig­i­tal of­fer­ing is the pre­lude to a new ex­hi­bi­tion – Home, Truly: Grow­ing Up With Sin­ga­pore, 1950s To The Present – which will open at the Na­tional Mu­seum later this year.</p>
    <p>Home, Truly is pre­sented in col­lab­o­ra­tion with The Straits Times and is part of the pa­per’s 175th an­niver­sary con­tri­bu­tion to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Pack a pic­nic and set­tle down at the Padang for a 20-minute slideshow of art at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore’s light-up.</p>
    <p>The gallery has gone one bet­ter than the other build­ings in the civic district for their Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions with art­works pro­jected onto the Golden Canopy for the first time. The canopy is the metal struc­ture link­ing the for­mer City Hall and Supreme Court build­ings.</p>
    <p>It is also the first time it put out an open call for artists to sub­mit works re­spond­ing to pieces in the mu­seum’s col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse was over­whelm­ing, with more than 180 en­tries, which the cu­ra­tors then whit­tled down to 60 works.</p>
    <p>Ms Suenne Me­gan Tan, t he gallery’s di­rec­tor of au­di­ence de­vel­op­ment and en­gage­ment, says the sub­mis­sions were very in­spir­ing. “What this project has shown is art is quite fun­da­men­tal to the hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence. What’s in­ter­est­ing also is the di­ver­sity of voices and per­spec­tives, so we had pho­tog­ra­phers and writ­ers. There were also ar­chi­tects, de­sign­ers and ed­u­ca­tors.”</p>
    <p>The show will be on every evening from 7pm to mid­night un­til Aug 30.</p>
    <p>Art lovers might also want to claim a free mem­ber­ship to the Gallery In­sider pro­gramme, part of the mu­seum’s NDP2020 cel­e­bra­tions. In­sid­ers get pri­or­ity ac­cess to events as well as dis­counts at the food-and-bev­er­age and re­tail out­lets. Sign up at str.sg/Jnd9.</p>
    <p>Here are some works to look out for.</p>
