    <p>The United States faces a tor­rid week, with two events that would nor­mally be rel­a­tively un­event­ful as­sum­ing great sig­nif­i­cance this year – Se­nate run-off elec­tions in Ge­or­gia to­mor­row, and a joint ses­sion of Congress in Wash­ing­ton on Wednesday.</p>
    <p>The two run-offs in Ge­or­gia will de­cide whether Pres­i­dent-elect</p>
    <p>Joe Bi­den and the Demo­cratic Party con­trol the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>If the Democrats win, con­trol of the Se­nate would be split 50-50 and in­com­ing vice-pres­i­dent Ka­mala Har­ris would have tie-break­ing votes – in ef­fect giv­ing the party con­trol.</p>
    <p>But if ei­ther of the Repub­li­can in­cum­bents, Mr David Per­due and Ms Kelly Lo­ef­fler, pre­vails, then the party’s ma­jor­ity will hold and that will se­verely con­strain, if not paral­yse, Mr Bi­den’s agenda.</p>
    <p>The joint ses­sion on Wednesday, dur­ing which Congress will count Elec­toral Col­lege votes and an­nounce the next pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent, is nor­mally a for­mal­ity. But this time that, too, is any­thing but.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump con­tin­ues to main­tain he won the elec­tion – though none of the bar­rage of law­suits filed by his al­lies and his le­gal team has stood up in any court.</p>
    <p>And at least 12 Repub­li­can sen­a­tors, led by Mr Ted Cruz of Texas, will be chal­leng­ing the va­lid­ity of the Elec­toral Col­lege vote in which Mr Bi­den pre­vailed 306-232.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say that while the chal­lenges will trig­ger long de­bates, they are doomed to fail.</p>
    <p>Yet there is an­other as­pect: Mr Trump has called his sup­port­ers to the streets of Wash­ing­ton. The white su­prem­a­cist Proud Boys group will be among them, claim­ing to be 1,000 strong alone. Far-left groups will be ready. Once again, down­town Wash­ing­ton is boarded up and brac­ing it­self for a fight.</p>
    <p>But all eyes are first on Ge­or­gia, be­cause it is un­prece­dented for con­trol of the Se­nate to hinge on two seats from one state.</p>
    <p>Both par­ties have cast the run-offs in seis­mic terms. Repub­li­cans say if the Democrats con­trol both Houses of Congress, they will turn the US into a col­laps­ing so­cial­ist night­mare. Democrats say that con­tin­u­ing Repub­li­can con­trol means Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell can block al­most any­thing Mr Bi­den does, putting his en­tire agenda at risk.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly if the Democrats win, it would be a po­lit­i­cal earthquake, giv­ing the party con­trol of both Congress and the White House and dis­lodg­ing Mr McCon­nell from his pow­er­ful perch.</p>
    <p>“2020 ain’t over un­til Jan 5,” Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Har­ris said last month at a rally in Ge­or­gia. “That’s when 2020 will be over.”</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris and Mr Bi­den, and on the other side, Mr Trump and Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, are barn­storm­ing Ge­or­gia in a last-ditch fight to turn out sup­port­ers. The Cen­tre for Re­spon­sive Pol­i­tics says the con­tests, cost­ing nearly half a bil­lion dol­lars, are the two most ex­pen­sive in the coun­try’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>On Nov 3, none of the can­di­dates re­ceived more than 50 per cent of the vote, a re­quire­ment for win­ning elec­tions in Ge­or­gia – hence trig­ger­ing the run-offs.</p>
    <p>Polling in­di­cates noth­ing much has changed. But 70,000 new vot­ers have re­port­edly reg­is­tered in Ge­or­gia since Nov 3. More than 2.8 mil­lion – a record num­ber – had cast early bal­lots as of last Thurs­day – sug­gest­ing strong Demo­cratic turnout. Repub­li­cans tend to vote in per­son on the day of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Jan 6 in Wash­ing­ton will dis­til the tox­i­c­ity of the US po­lit­i­cal di­vide. Ob­jec­tions to Elec­toral Col­lege votes have been filed be­fore, in­clud­ing by Democrats, but have been mostly sym­bolic. This time, there will be high drama. The 12 Repub­li­can sen­a­tors will de­mand a 10-day de­lay to en­able an emer­gency au­dit of votes in key states that Mr Trump in­sists were “stolen”.</p>
    <p>An­other at­tempt to scup­per the Elec­toral Col­lege vote failed on Satur­day, when an Ap­peals Court up­held a fed­eral judge’s de­ci­sion to re­ject a law­suit from Repub­li­can Con­gress­man Louie Gohmert ar­gu­ing that Mr Pence had the power to in­val­i­date Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“At one level, it is po­lit­i­cal the­atre of the most ex­treme mem­bers... in this in­stance am­bi­tious US sen­a­tors… who be­lieve Trump will not run in 2024, want to in­herit his base, and can do this with what most of us will re­gard as a stunt,” Dr Glenn Altschuler, pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can stud­ies at Cor­nell Univer­sity, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But, to­gether with the protests in the streets, it will also re­in­force the no­tion of Mr Trump’s base that the elec­tion was rigged.</p>
    <p>The move is not without risk to Repub­li­cans. “Jan 6 will come and go,” Dr Altschuler said. “But it will also mean that quite a num­ber of Repub­li­cans will have to go on record as ei­ther en­dors­ing ground­less claims of elec­tion fraud or go­ing against Pres­i­dent Trump, who is so pop­u­lar with his base.”</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, divisions be­came clearer. Se­na­tor Mitt Rom­ney of Utah called the move by the group of his fel­low Repub­li­can sen­a­tors “an egre­gious ploy” that “dan­ger­ously threat­ens our Demo­cratic Repub­lic”.</p>
    <p>And Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she would “vote to af­firm the 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion”.</p>
