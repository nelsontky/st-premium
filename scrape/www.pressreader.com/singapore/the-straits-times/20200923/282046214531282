    <p>IBM will train about 800 mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als over the next year in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and cy­ber se­cu­rity un­der a new pro­gramme an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is part of a larger gov­ern­ment ef­fort by Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore (SSG) to pro­vide 30,000 train­ing places for Sin­ga­pore­ans this year, as an­nounced in May.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at IBM’s premises in Changi Busi­ness Park yes­ter­day, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said about 18,000 of the 30,000 places have been cre­ated to date by em­ploy­ers like IBM, train­ing providers and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­sponse to the train­ing spots on of­fer has also been strong, with al­most 15,000 peo­ple ex­press­ing in­ter­est so far, he added.</p>
    <p>“So long as our mid-ca­reer (pro­fes­sion­als) have the right mind­set to want to con­tinue to reskill and up­skill, we will do our part to pro­vide you with the sup­port nec­es­sary to get the rel­e­vant train­ing and be in a good po­si­tion to get a job when the econ­omy re­cov­ers,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at skills that will be in de­mand and in ar­eas of fu­ture growth, and IT is nat­u­rally one of these ar­eas. IT it­self is not a ver­ti­cal sec­tor but a skill set that can be ap­plied in many sec­tors... and a pro­gramme like this will po­ten­tially al­low the grad­u­ates to be em­ploy­able across many fields.”</p>
    <p>IBM’s pro­gramme, called i.am-vi­tal­ize, of­fers two full-time train­ing cour­ses in AI and cy­ber se­cu­rity that will run over six months.</p>
    <p>Trainees for both cour­ses will com­plete a set of in­tro­duc­tory mod­ules over the first 21/ months, be</p>
    <p>2 fore branch­ing out into spe­cialised tracks.</p>
    <p>The first five on­line classes, com­pris­ing 13 or 14 trainees to two in­struc­tors, started on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The course costs $500 with SSG sub­si­dies, and trainees also re­ceive a $1,500 monthly al­lowance.</p>
    <p>En­rol­ment is open un­til March next year, and those in­ter­ested can sign up at https://we­bibm­course.my­bluemix.net/SGUnit­edPro­gramme</p>
    <p>About 400 mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als have signed up so far, with more than 200 ac­cepted and due to be­gin classes in batches over the next few months.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants have to be Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents, and pos­sess ba­sic IT lit­er­acy such as be­ing fa­mil­iar with Web browsers and us­ing a mouse and key­board.</p>
    <p>AI de­sign­ers, blockchain de­vel­op­ers and data en­gi­neers are among the roles that trainees can tran­si­tion into upon grad­u­a­tion, IBM said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also linked up with in­dus­try part­ners such as Stan­dard Char­tered Bank and blockchain firm Tribe Ac­cel­er­a­tor to fa­cil­i­tate job place­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and give feed­back on what em­ploy­ers want.</p>
    <p>“We are def­i­nitely look­ing to em­ploy some of the grad­u­ates from these cour­ses,” said IBM Sin­ga­pore manag­ing di­rec­tor Martin Chee.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, we al­ways want to hire the best, and many of the trainees come from amaz­ing back­grounds. It’s a case of com­bin­ing tech­nol­ogy with busi­ness, and these stu­dents will have some­thing to add that will make them more em­ploy­able.”</p>
    <p>Tribe Ac­cel­er­a­tor manag­ing part­ner Ng Yi Ming said the pro­gramme fo­cuses on real-life case stud­ies and sce­nar­ios where knowl­edge of AI and cy­ber se­cu­rity can be ap­plied, some­thing which em­ploy­ers are look­ing for.</p>
    <p>It is less the­o­ret­i­cal and more about how AI and cy­ber se­cu­rity can be ap­plied to ev­ery­day work and un­der­stand­ing com­pa­nies’ needs, he added.</p>
    <p>About 400 mid-ca­reer pro­fes­sion­als have signed up so far, with more than 200 ac­cepted and due to be­gin classes in batches over the next few months.</p>
