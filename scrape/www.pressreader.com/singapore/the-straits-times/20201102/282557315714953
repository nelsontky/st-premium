    <p>At the height of the bike-shar­ing wave in early 2018, there were about 200,000 such bikes in Sin­ga­pore owned by seven com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But that has since dwin­dled to just two – SG Bike and Any­wheel – with gi­ants such as Mo­bike and Ofo ex­it­ing the mar­ket last year.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing sur­vived the in­dus­try tur­bu­lence, lo­cal start-up SG Bike is now Sin­ga­pore’s largest bike-share op­er­a­tor af­ter tak­ing over Mo­bike’s li­cence to op­er­ate 25,000 bi­cy­cles for $2.54 mil­lion last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>And SG Bike is not about to stop there, as it plans to quadru­ple its fleet to 100,000 by 2023. Its ri­val, Any­wheel, was in July given ap­proval by the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) to in­crease its fleet size from 10,000 to 15,000.</p>
    <p>SG Bike chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Sean Tay told The Straits Times that the com­pany, which pre­vi­ously had a li­cence for 3,000 bikes, could not pass up on the op­por­tu­nity to ac­quire Mo­bike’s fleet de­spite the risks in­volved.</p>
    <p>He said: “The odds were stacked against us, but this was a big chance for us to see where we could go with this. If you think about the other log­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions for buy­ing a busi­ness, the an­swer is a clear no.</p>
    <p>“There were too many un­cer­tain­ties, so it was re­ally a very bold move and one of the big­gest de­ci­sions (we’ve had to make), but it paid off.”</p>
    <p>SG Bike’s co-founders of Tay, chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer David Lim and chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer Ben­jamin Oh, are con­fi­dent that there is still a fu­ture for the in­dus­try as the Gov­ern­ment de­vel­ops Sin­ga­pore’s cy­cling in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>In March, the LTA an­nounced plans to ac­cel­er­ate the tre­bling of Sin­ga­pore’s cy­cling path net­work to 1,320km by 2030 in a pro­ject that will cost over $1 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Tay said: “We want to build some­thing so that fu­ture gen­er­a­tions can grow up in this coun­try where they not only can use buses, taxis and MRTs, but also bikes. We want to be proud in 20 years and say we built this, and it’s some­thing that mo­ti­vates us ev­ery sin­gle day.”</p>
    <p>But Tay also stressed that hit­ting the goal of 100,000 bikes in three years’ time was an “op­ti­mistic” tar­get, with Lim adding that the com­pany is tak­ing a cau­tious ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Lim said: “We don’t want to be sta­tion­ary, but we don’t want to fall into the trap that the first wave (of op­er­a­tors) did. We want to make sure that the ex­pan­sion of our fleet is main­tain­able and sta­ble.”</p>
    <p>Like many busi­nesses here, it was also hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic, as safety mea­sures im­ple­mented dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker saw it hav­ing to shut down op­er­a­tions at its ware­house. As a re­sult, the com­pany was un­able to re­pair its faulty bi­cy­cles and had to de­com­mis­sion about 20 to 40 per cent of its fleet to en­sure the safety of its users.</p>
    <p>But with mea­sures grad­u­ally eas­ing over the past few months, the com­pany has man­aged to ride out the tough times and is fo­cus­ing on its next pro­ject: the Nov 1-15 OCBC Cy­cle 2020 Vir­tual Ride.</p>
    <p>The firm is the event’s of­fi­cial bike-shar­ing part­ner and par­tic­i­pants can use its bi­cy­cles to com­plete any of the four cat­e­gories – 800m, 5km, 23km The Straits</p>
    <p>Times Vir­tual Ride and 42km The Sportive Vir­tual Ride – over the two weeks.</p>
    <p>The rental rate of SG Bike’s stan­dard se­ries bike is $1 for the first 30 min­utes and $0.03 for each sub­se­quent minute. Those who use its bikes for the OCBC 2020 Vir­tual Ride will get $15 worth of credit when they top up their SG Bike ac­counts by $10. They can also re­serve the bikes on­line in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Oh said: “OCBC Cy­cle wants to cham­pion cy­cling as a year-round ac­tiv­ity, which is sim­i­lar to our vi­sion. We want to cham­pion bi­cy­cles as a form of le­git­i­mate trans­port that ev­ery­one will con­sider.”</p>
    <p>One of the key rea­sons that sets</p>
    <p>SG Bike apart from its com­peti­tors – then and now – said its founders, is op­er­a­tional ex­cel­lence. It had en­tered the mar­ket in Au­gust 2017 with the hope of solv­ing the is­sue of in­dis­crim­i­nate park­ing and mis­use by im­ple­ment­ing a sys­tem that would fine its users if they did not park in des­ig­nated zones. It con­tin­ues to sur­vey res­i­dents and work with town coun­cils to un­der­stand user pat­terns of spe­cific towns.</p>
    <p>Oh added: “Ul­ti­mately, bike shar­ing is not just about pro­vid­ing bi­cy­cles. We need to man­age users and stake­hold­ers so there’s a level of un­der­stand­ing.”</p>
    <p>A PLAN FOR THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>We want to build some­thing so that fu­ture gen­er­a­tions can grow up in this coun­try where they not only can use buses, taxis and MRTs, but also bikes.</p>
    <p>SEAN TAY, SG Bike’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
