    <p>HONG KONG • A cruise ship oper­a­tor con­trolled by Malaysian ty­coon Lim Kok Thay sus­pended all payments to cred­i­tors, trig­ger­ing a 37.5 per cent drop in the com­pany’s shares and dent­ing in­vestor con­fi­dence in Tan Sri Lim’s wider busi­ness em­pire.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Hong Kong said that it will use its avail­able funds to main­tain crit­i­cal ser­vices for the com­pany’s op­er­a­tions and asked cred­i­tors to form a steer­ing com­mit­tee to eval­u­ate a planned re­struc­tur­ing pro­posal, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment to the Hong Kong stock ex­change on Wed­nes­day night. The com­pany owed a to­tal of US$3.4 bil­lion (S$4.66 bil­lion) as of July 31, it said.</p>
    <p>The firm blamed the cash crunch on the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and said the pay­ment halt will likely re­sult in de­fault.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim owned 69 per cent of the Hong Kong unit’s shares as of April 3, ac­cord­ing to data compiled by Bloomberg. Malaysia’s casino-to­hos­pi­tal­ity con­glom­er­ate Gent­ing Ber­had and its units pre­vi­ously im­posed its first group­wide salary cut since its found­ing in 1965.</p>
    <p>“For Gent­ing, the fi­nan­cial stress may push the owner to sell the as­set, or liq­ui­date the en­tire firm,” said CEB In­ter­na­tional In­vest­ment Corp’s head of re­search Banny Lam. “Liq­ui­da­tion is not very likely, but there is such a pos­si­bil­ity if Lim doesn’t have money and can’t find a buyer for its as­sets. In that case, eq­uity hold­ers rank be­hind bond hold­ers to get com­pen­sated.”</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Hong Kong shares fell by a record 37.5 per cent yes­ter­day to close at 30 Hong Kong cents.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Ber­had shares were un­traded due to a hol­i­day in Malaysia. Shares of Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, which op­er­ates Re­sorts World Sen­tosa, dropped 2.1 per cent to 69 cents.</p>
    <p>Malayan Bank­ing and RHB Bank were the big­gest con­trib­u­tors to Gent­ing Hong Kong’s syn­di­cated loans, ac­cord­ing to data compiled by Bloomberg based on dis­closed al­lo­ca­tions at sign­ing.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Hong Kong was for­merly known as Star Cruises, and op­er­ates the Star Cruises, Dream Cruises and Crys­tal Cruises lines.</p>
    <p>Back in Fe­bru­ary, pas­sen­gers on the World Dream ves­sel were quar­an­tined in Hong Kong after pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus cases were found on the ship.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try has been bat­tered by lock­down mea­sures and travel curbs across the globe.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has barred non-res­i­dents from en­ter­ing the city since March, while res­i­dents re­turn­ing from abroad have to quar­an­tine them­selves for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s Gent­ing Ber­had op­er­ates casi­nos and re­sorts in Las Ve­gas and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It has had to scale back op­er­a­tions as coun­tries im­pose lock­downs and con­sumers shun cruises after a few ships be­came sites of coro­n­avirus out­breaks. The con­glom­er­ate, founded in Malaysia in 1965, is also in­volved in the prop­erty, plan­ta­tion and en­ergy sec­tors, as well as life sciences.</p>
    <p>“(It is) still early days and much will hinge on the out­come of (Gent­ing Hong Kong’s) fund-rais­ing ex­er­cise and the re­struc­tur­ing of ex­ist­ing in­debt­ed­ness,” said United First Part­ners di­rec­tor Rui Oh. “If this is re­solved, then (it will) like­lier than not have a pos­i­tive bear­ing on the other en­ti­ties, but oth­er­wise, there will be a need to dis­pose as­sets to raise cash.”</p>
    <p>The Re­sorts World Las Ve­gas US$1 bil­lion 2029 bonds dropped 6.2 cents to 93.5 cents on the dol­lar, and were poised for the largest de­cline since April, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg-compiled prices. Re­sorts World Las Ve­gas is a wholly owned in­di­rect sub­sidiary of Gent­ing Ber­had, which is the keep­well provider for the se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Ber­had is also the keep­well provider for Gent­ing Over­seas Hold­ings’ US$1.5 bil­lion 2027 bonds, which fell 2.3 cents to 99.6 cents on the dol­lar, the prices showed.</p>
