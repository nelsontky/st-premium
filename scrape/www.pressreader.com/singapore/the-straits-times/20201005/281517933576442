    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump feels well and could be dis­charged as early as to­day, his doc­tors said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“To­day, he feels well, he’s been up and around... Our hope is we can plan for dis­charge as early as to­mor­row,” Dr Brian Garibaldi, who is part of the team treat­ing the Pres­i­dent, said in a 10-minute up­date at the Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent con­tin­ues to im­prove and is walk­ing around, the doc­tors said.</p>
    <p>This came as a poll showed Demo­cratic Party can­di­date Joe Bi­den slightly widen­ing his lead over the Pres­i­dent by one or two points to give him a 10-point edge.</p>
    <p>The Reuters/Ip­sos poll con­ducted last Fri­day and Satur­day found that a ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans think Mr Trump could have avoided in­fec­tion if he had taken the virus more se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Fifty-one per cent of likely vot­ers backed Mr Bi­den, while 41 per cent said they would vote for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>In a video mes­sage from the hos­pi­tal l ast Satur­day, the Pres­i­dent, look­ing pale and drawn but man­ag­ing some hu­mour, said “we’re work­ing hard to get me all the way back”.</p>
    <p>“Over the next pe­riod of a few days, I guess that’s the real test, so we’ll be see­ing what hap­pens over those next couple of days,” he said in the video.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage was greeted with loud cheers and honk­ing of car horns by a small crowd of sup­port­ers out­side the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The video, and pic­tures re­leased later by the White House show­ing the Pres­i­dent ap­par­ently work­ing at a desk, seemed de­signed to al­lay mount­ing con­cerns trig­gered by con­flict­ing in­for­ma­tion from his doc­tors and the White House.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day af­ter­noon, doc­tors had of­fered a rosy as­sess­ment that he was “very en­er­getic”, but state­ments by White House chief of staff Mark Mead­ows gave a dif­fer­ent ac­count, with Mr Mead­ows say­ing the</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent’s con­di­tion had been “very con­cern­ing”.</p>
    <p>His re­marks re­port­edly an­gered the Pres­i­dent, and Mr Mead­ows told Fox News last Satur­day night that there had been an “un­be­liev­able im­prove­ment”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, White House physi­cian Sean Con­ley said Mr Trump had two episodes of tran­sient dip in oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den last Satur­day told an au­di­ence in Michi­gan that while he did not want to be at­tack­ing Mr</p>
    <p>Trump and the First Lady now, he said the Pres­i­dent’s re­sponse to the pan­demic was “un­con­scionable”.</p>
    <p>As Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and grow­ing num­bers of his in­ner cir­cle fall ill with Covid-19, cases have risen across sev­eral states – 24 saw their num­ber of new cases rise at least 10 per cent last week from the week be­fore, ac­cord­ing to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Reuters analysis, last Satur­day alone, four states – Ken­tucky, Min­nesota, Mon­tana and Wis­con­sin – saw record in­creases in new cases, and na­tion­ally, nearly 49,000 new in­fec­tions were re­ported, the high­est for a Satur­day in seven weeks.</p>
    <p>The United States is re­port­ing 42,600 new cases and 700 deaths on av­er­age each day, and there are fears that cases – and deaths – will con­tinue to in­crease as cold weather forces more peo­ple to min­gle in­doors where the dan­ger of pass­ing the virus around is greater.</p>
    <p>New York City re­ported “con­cern­ing clus­ters” of high pos­i­tive rates. The city’s health de­part­ment said 12 neigh­bour­hoods were ac­count­ing for 30 per cent of new cases de­spite the fact that they rep­re­sent only 9 per cent of the city’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Three Repub­li­can sen­a­tors and Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee chair­man Ronna McDaniel have also tested pos­i­tive. So has Mr Trump’s cam­paign man­ager Bill Stepien.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, the coro­n­avirus has killed more than 209,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The shadow of the pan­demic, and the eco­nomic de­struc­tion trig­gered by it, looms larger now with Pres­i­dent Trump’s hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>White House doc­tor Sean Con­ley last Satur­day de­clined to give a timetable for Mr Trump’s pos­si­ble re­lease from hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son also had the coro­n­avirus some</p>
    <p>months ago, and saw his pop­u­lar­ity rise slightly on sym­pa­thy. But there may be no such bump for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“The US is way too di­vided/Pres­i­dent Trump too di­vi­sive to elicit the broader sym­pa­thy that Boris John­son re­ceived in the UK,” tweeted Eura­sia Group pres­i­dent Ian Brem­mer yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Thus, Mr Trump’s sidelin­ing amid a tight race in which half a dozen states are still rated toss-ups can­not be al­lowed to de­rail the cam­paign, which Mr Stepien con­tin­ues to man­age re­motely.</p>
    <p>In dis­cus­sions with sup­port­ers last Satur­day, Mr Trump’s son Eric and daughter-in-law Lara, and cam­paign of­fi­cials, main­tained that the Pres­i­dent was in good shape and that news cov­er­age of his con­di­tion was overblown, The New York Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>“The main­stream me­dia makes their money off of hav­ing shock and awe,” Ms Lara Trump told sup­port­ers on a phone call. “Please, when you see these re­ports, do not get up­set.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent was “go­ing to come out on top” and beat the virus “to a pulp” and he would then “very hand­ily beat Joe Bi­den to a pulp on Nov 3”, she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Trump de­scribed his father as en­er­getic and said they had spo­ken at length by phone, with the Pres­i­dent at one point telling an aide to get Se­na­tor Mitch McCon­nell, the ma­jor­ity leader, on the phone to dis­cuss a long-stalled</p>
    <p>stim­u­lus pack­age.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond of three pres­i­den­tial de­bates of the cam­paign, sched­uled for Oct 15, is in doubt.</p>
    <p>But to keep sup­port­ers en­er­gised, the Trump cam­paign is billing its next phase as “Op­er­a­tion Maga” – a mix of vir­tual events lead­ing up to Wed­nes­day’s sched­uled de­bate be­tween Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump is “go­ing to de­feat this virus” and “once he gets out of the hos­pi­tal, he’s ready to get back to the cam­paign trail”, senior cam­paign ad­viser Jason Miller told NBC’s Meet the Press yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Miller said that in a phone con­ver­sa­tion last Satur­day the Pres­i­dent – who has been for months de­fy­ing pub­lic health rec­om­men­da­tions and mock­ing his ri­val, Mr Bi­den, for wear­ing a mask – wants “to re­mind folks to wash their hands, use hand sani­tiser, make sure that if you can’t so­cially dis­tance to wear a mask”.</p>
    <p>In a tweet, Dr Jonathan Metzl, pro­fes­sor of so­ci­ol­ogy and psy­chi­a­try at Van­der­bilt Univer­sity, wrote: “Core Trump base no more likely to start wear­ing masks than they are to sup­port health­care re­form, sav­ing the planet, gun safety.</p>
    <p>“Rather, get­ting Covid-19 now takes on new po­lit­i­cal mean­ing – be­comes an ex­pres­sion of self-sac­ri­fice and a way of show­ing de­vo­tion to the cause.”</p>
