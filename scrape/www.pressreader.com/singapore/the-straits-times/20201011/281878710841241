    <p>The FBI and Michi­gan state au­thor­i­ties have charged 13 men who they said were part of, or work­ing with, an anti-govern­ment group with a range of crimes in­clud­ing ter­ror­ism, con­spir­acy and gun of­fences.</p>
    <p>The men had re­ferred to Michi­gan’s Gover­nor Gretchen Whit­mer in vul­gar terms, the au­thor­i­ties said, and seemed to be mo­ti­vated by a be­lief that she was a “tyrant” who was vi­o­lat­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said the group that planned the kid­nap­ping met re­peat­edly over the sum­mer for firearms train­ing and com­bat drills and prac­tised build­ing ex­plo­sives.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers also gath­ered sev­eral times to dis­cuss the mis­sion, in­clud­ing in the base­ment of a shop that was ac­ces­si­ble only through a “trap door” un­der a rug. The men spied on Ms Whit­mer’s va­ca­tion home in Au­gust and Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>They went look­ing un­der a high­way bridge for places they could place and det­o­nate a bomb to dis­tract the au­thor­i­ties, the FBI said.</p>
    <p>They in­di­cated that they wanted to take Ms Whit­mer hostage be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, and one man said they should take her to a “se­cure lo­ca­tion” in Wis­con­sin for a “trial”, ac­cord­ing to FBI spe­cial agent Richard Trask II in the crim­i­nal com­plaint.</p>
    <p>He said one of those ar­rested had bought a Taser for the mis­sion and that the men had been plan­ning to buy ex­plo­sives.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors say the men also sought to sin­gle out law en­force­ment of­fi­cers for in­tim­i­da­tion, made threats of vi­o­lence to in­cite civil un­rest, and trained for an op­er­a­tion to storm the Michi­gan State Capi­tol in Lans­ing and take govern­ment of­fi­cials hostage.</p>
