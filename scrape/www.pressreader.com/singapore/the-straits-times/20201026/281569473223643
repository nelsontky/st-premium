    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion is fol­low­ing up with the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and other uni­ver­si­ties to en­sure the safety of stu­dents, af­ter the dis­missal of for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low Jeremy Fer­nando amid al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>The Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry is fol­low­ing up with the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) and other uni­ver­si­ties to en­sure stu­dent safety, af­ter the dis­missal of for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low Jeremy Fer­nando over al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Satur­day, Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xueling said the univer­sity lead­er­ship has been asked what more can be done to pre­vent such in­stances from hap­pen­ing in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the schools have a duty of care to their stu­dents, she wrote: “There must be zero tol­er­ance in our cam­puses for any form of sex­ual mis­con­duct, ha­rass­ment or vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando was sacked from NUS on Oct 7 af­ter in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that he “had an in­ti­mate as­so­ci­a­tion” with an un­der­grad­u­ate, NUS said last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Two stu­dents al­leged that he made non-con­sen­sual ad­vances to­wards them, and the univer­sity has also filed a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said: “The is­sues around this case lead us to ques­tion: How can we bet­ter guard against ed­u­ca­tors and other in­di­vid­u­als who cross the line, and how can we col­lec­tively strengthen cam­pus safety?”</p>
    <p>She added that the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion will con­tinue work­ing closely with all in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing to tighten pro­cesses where needed and en­sure the safety of the stu­dent com­mu­nity at all times.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the Face­book post in a com­ment, NUS dean of stu­dents Leong Ching clar­i­fied that when she ad­mit­ted the univer­sity could have han­dled the is­sue bet­ter dur­ing a me­dia con­fer­ence last Fri­day, she re­ferred to the “less-than-timely com­mu­ni­ca­tion” of the univer­sity’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Leong wrote: “I do not re­fer to our re­sponse to the com­plaint, which was first, to pro­vide im­me­di­ate sup­port and care to the stu­dents in­volved; sec­ond to im­me­di­ately sus­pend and then sum­mar­ily dis­miss the staff, all in just over a month. I be­lieve that this was the most ex­pe­di­tious pos­si­ble, while keep­ing to due process.”</p>
    <p>She added: “With re­spect, min­is­ter, this is what zero tol­er­ance looks like.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh, Tem­busu Col­lege’s rec­tor, ac­knowl­edged at a me­dia brief­ing last Fri­day that NUS had not given timely up­dates on the case. He added that go­ing for­ward, it will be more open in the way it pro­vides in­for­ma­tion about sex­ual mis­con­duct cases.</p>
    <p>ZERO TOL­ER­ANCE</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, our in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing have a duty of care to their stu­dents. There must be zero tol­er­ance in our cam­puses for any form of sex­ual mis­con­duct, ha­rass­ment or vi­o­lence. ’’</p>
