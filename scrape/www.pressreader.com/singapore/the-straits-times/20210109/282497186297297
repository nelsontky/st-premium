    <p>OCBC Bank aims to dou­ble the num­ber of users and vol­ume of trans­ac­tions on its Pay Any­one app this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Gary Wong, OCBC’s newly minted head of dig­i­tal pay­ments, said: “It is an am­bi­tious tar­get, but there has never been a bet­ter time to do so.</p>
    <p>“Covid has fun­da­men­tally changed the way busi­nesses op­er­ate on­line, and cus­tomers are now more pre­pared to adopt dig­i­tal pay­ments.”</p>
    <p>He added that the bank aims to at­tract users through a wider va­ri­ety of part­ner­ships and more per­son­alised con­tent.</p>
    <p>The vol­ume of trans­ac­tions on Pay Any­one grew by an av­er­age of more than 50 per cent month on month from June to Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who pre­vi­ously headed GrabPay Sin­ga­pore, took up his new role last month but is no stranger to OCBC. He headed strate­gic part­ner­ships for its lifestyle fi­nanc­ing from 2014 to 2018.</p>
    <p>He said the bank will bring in more per­son­alised con­tent on Pay Any­one – for ex­am­ple, by in­te­grat­ing money in­sights and sav­ings goals into the app.</p>
    <p>Pay Any­one was launched in 2014 as a pay­ment ser­vice on OCBC’s mo­bile bank­ing app.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the bank launched a stand­alone Pay Any­one app, which now has sev­eral hun­dred thou­sand cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>OCBC is also ex­plor­ing Pay Any­one col­lab­o­ra­tions with firms in ar­eas such as daily es­sen­tials, ride hail­ing and de­liv­ery ser­vices. De­tails are still in the works. These part­ner­ships might also in­volve e-wal­lets and gov­ern­ment ser­vices, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>Last April, OCBC brought Google Pay’s peer-topeer funds trans­fer ser­vice to Sin­ga­pore, al­low­ing cus­tomers to pay di­rectly from their ac­counts to any­one reg­is­tered to PayNow us­ing the Google Pay app.</p>
    <p>The bank will also con­sider im­port­ing trusted sys­tems such as SingPass into Pay Any­one to make the pay­ments ex­pe­ri­ence more seam­less for con­sumers, said Mr Wong. He noted that from last year, OCBC cus­tomers could use their SingPass to ac­cess dig­i­tal bank­ing ser­vices via the bank’s mo­bile app or In­ter­net bank­ing.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumers want speed, ac­cu­racy, con­ve­nience and safety. How do we bun­dle these fac­tors into con­tent that we are able to de­liver? That’s the chal­lenge we’ve set for our­selves,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong added that dig­i­tal banks and tra­di­tional play­ers have much to learn from each other.</p>
    <p>“They have ca­pa­bil­i­ties, for which we can per­haps shorten the time taken to build, while we have cus­tomer trust and a large cus­tomer base. To­gether, we can of­fer a more in­te­grated so­lu­tion to con­sumers.”</p>
