    <p>WASHINGTON The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) de­liv­ered a clear re­buke to health of­fi­cials at­tempt­ing to al­ter the tim­ing and dosage of Covid-19 vac­cines: Do not mess with our guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The agency, in a state­ment late on Mon­day, urged that vac­cines be given ac­cord­ing to how the FDA has au­tho­rised them af­ter a key US of­fi­cial pro­posed cut­ting dosage lev­els for Moderna’s shot as a way to im­mu­nise more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments and health of­fi­cials have also con­sid­ered ex­tend­ing the length of time be­tween doses or mix­ing and match­ing vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“Sug­gest­ing changes to the FDA-au­tho­rised dos­ing or sched­ules of these vac­cines is pre­ma­ture and not rooted solidly in the avail­able ev­i­dence,” FDA com­mis­sioner Stephen Hahn said.</p>
    <p>He warned that such changes may not guar­an­tee the high level of pro­tec­tion ob­served in the clin­i­cal tri­als, run­ning a “sig­nif­i­cant risk” of en­dan­ger­ing pub­lic health and un­der­min­ing vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments around the globe are try­ing to ac­cel­er­ate vac­cine roll-out ef­forts as dis­tri­bu­tion has proven slower than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Though the United States and other coun­tries au­tho­rised some vac­cines at un­prece­dented speed and have stock­piled hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses, the pace of ac­tual in­oc­u­la­tions has been chal­lenged by un­ex­pected glitches and lo­gis­ti­cal prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, chief sci­en­tific of­fi­cer of Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, the US gov­ern­ment’s vac­cine drive, asked Moderna and the FDA to cut in half the dose of the com­pany’s vac­ci­na­tion for peo­ple aged be­tween 18 and 55 af­ter find­ing ev­i­dence that it in­duces the same im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>That would dou­ble the amount of vac­cine avail­able for the age group, while pro­vid­ing the same level of pro­tec­tion, he said on CBS pro­gramme Face The Na­tion on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a Bri­tish plan would al­low for sec­ond doses of vac­cines to be ad­min­is­tered as many as 12 weeks af­ter the first, longer than the tim­ing de­ter­mined as op­ti­mal for shots de­vel­oped by Pfizer and Moderna.</p>
    <p>The FDA said the ef­fec­tive­ness seen in late-stage tri­als can be safely at­tained only if the shot de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech is re­ceived at an in­ter­val of 21 days, and the one from Moderna is ad­min­is­tered at an in­ter­val of 28 days.</p>
    <p>Pfizer last week em­pha­sised its vac­cine should be de­liv­ered to in­di­vid­u­als within the rec­om­mended three-week pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Hahn ac­knowl­edged that a small num­ber of peo­ple in the Moderna and Pfizer tri­als did not fol­low the three- or four-week in­ter­val reg­i­men, but these peo­ple were not fol­lowed long enough for any de­fin­i­tive con­clu­sions about the depth and du­ra­tion of pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>“If peo­ple do not truly know how pro­tec­tive a vac­cine is, there is the po­ten­tial for harm be­cause they may as­sume that they are fully pro­tected when they are not, and ac­cord­ingly, al­ter their be­hav­iour to take un­nec­es­sary risks,” Dr Peter Marks, di­rec­tor of the FDA of­fice that over­sees vac­cines, said.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus’ resur­gence – aided by a faster-spread­ing strain – un­der­scores the ur­gency to vac­ci­nate more peo­ple as hos­pi­tals be­come over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Moderna on Mon­day lifted its pro­duc­tion fore­cast, say­ing it will make at least 600 mil­lion doses of its shot this year.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca is con­duct­ing fur­ther stud­ies on the vac­cine it de­vel­oped with the Univer­sity of Ox­ford af­ter ini­tial re­sults showed that a half dose fol­lowed by a full dose in­duced a higher pro­tec­tion rate than if a full dose was used in the first shot.</p>
    <p>It is also con­sid­er­ing stud­ies to learn how ef­fec­tive in­oc­u­la­tion can be when its can­di­date vac­cines are com­bined with those de­vel­oped by other com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion com­mis­sioner Stephen Hahn warned that such changes may not guar­an­tee the high level of pro­tec­tion ob­served in the clin­i­cal tri­als, run­ning a “sig­nif­i­cant risk” of en­dan­ger­ing pub­lic health and un­der­min­ing vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts.</p>
