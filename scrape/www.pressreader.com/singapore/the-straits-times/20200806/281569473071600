    <p>As so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules keep se­niors apart, many se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres are reach­ing out to the el­derly vir­tu­ally and help­ing them use dig­i­tal tools to stay en­gaged, says se­nior so­cial af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Theresa Tan (be­low).</p>
    <p>Re­tired bar­tender Yong Chow Foo, who has no chil­dren, used to visit the Care Cor­ner Se­nior Ac­tiv­ity Cen­tre in Wood­lands ev­ery week­day to chit-chat and play card games like rummy with other old folks.</p>
    <p>When the coron­avirus pan­demic struck and Sin­ga­pore en­forced the two-month-long cir­cuit breaker, se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres were closed and life be­came bor­ing, par­tic­u­larly so for Mr Yong as he is not tech-savvy.</p>
    <p>The 80-year-old uses his mo­bile phone for calls but does not know how to use a com­puter, surf the Web or send e-mails.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong, who lives in a one-room rental flat with his wife, re­called in Man­darin: “It felt suf­fo­cat­ing as we stayed at home all day, watch­ing TV or star­ing at the walls.”</p>
    <p>But now that se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres have re­opened, a new life is open­ing up for Mr Yong, as they are teach­ing se­niors how to go on­line and have some fun.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, staff from Care Cor­ner Sin­ga­pore lent Mr Yong a SIM card with a data plan, in­stalled the</p>
    <p>Skype app on his phone and taught him how to log on to ac­tiv­i­ties through it.</p>
    <p>On July 24, he went to the Wood­lands se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tre to join a vir­tual tour of Gar­dens by the Bay with nine other se­niors. At the cen­tre, he could ei­ther use his phone to take part in the vir­tual tour or watch it pro­jected onto a screen through a live stream. He chose the lat­ter op­tion.</p>
    <p>A group of se­niors from an­other Care Cor­ner se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tre also joined the vir­tual tour, and a few oth­ers did so from their homes through Skype.</p>
    <p>Con­ducted through a live stream by a hor­ti­cul­tur­ist, the vir­tual tour was the first by Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank em­ploy­ees who vol­un­teer at Care Cor­ner Sin­ga­pore were also at the se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tre to in­ter­act with the se­niors.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong de­scribed the vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties as in­ter­est­ing, though they felt for­eign to him.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has 78 se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres, ac­cord­ing to the Year­book of Sta­tis­tics 2019. These cen­tres usu­ally hold ac­tiv­i­ties such as mass ex­er­cises and karaoke ses­sions for se­niors to so­cialise with one an­other.</p>
    <p>So­cial work­ers say those who at­tend the events are poor, of­ten live alone and have lit­tle or no sup­port from their fam­i­lies. But at the cen­tres, they can in­ter­act with other se­niors while staff keep an eye on them.</p>
    <p>But as large group out­ings or gath­er­ings are not pos­si­ble now to keep the coron­avirus at bay, the cen­tres have turned to vir­tual out­ings and on­line ac­tiv­i­ties to en­gage se­niors.</p>
    <p>These cen­tres are teach­ing se­niors how to use com­mu­ni­ca­tion tools such as What­sApp and Zoom and to go on­line for var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Sandy Goh, man­ager at</p>
    <p>Touch Se­nior Ac­tiv­ity Cen­tre, said: “The pan­demic has dis­rupted the way we do things. We have to re­think the way we de­liver our ser­vices so that se­niors will con­tinue to get the help they need.”</p>
    <p>SAFE, YET SO­CIAL</p>
    <p>The push to take some of their ac­tiv­i­ties on­line comes amid the cur­rent safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, ac­tiv­i­ties are mod­i­fied so that se­niors can do them in­di­vid­u­ally, rather than in groups. The se­niors now do solo ac­tiv­i­ties such as sim­ple ex­er­cises and arts and crafts.</p>
    <p>Also, the num­ber of se­niors at the cen­tres at any one time is lim­ited as they have to be at a safe dis­tance of at least 1m apart, said a spokesman for the Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC).</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the num­ber of se­niors who go to these cen­tres has fallen.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, fewer than 3,000 se­niors went to Li­ons Be­frien­ders’ nine se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres when they re­sumed oper­a­tions in June, down from about 8,300 in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The fall is due to var­i­ous rea­sons, in­clud­ing some se­niors feel­ing it is un­safe to go out, and oth­ers find­ing the re­stric­tions too much of a has­sle.</p>
    <p>An­other prob­lem sur­faced dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker – a small group of se­niors did not own a phone and were not con­tactable.</p>
    <p>So­cial work­ers said these se­niors ei­ther could not af­ford a phone or were re­luc­tant to learn to use one, or they did not see the need for one as they have no one to talk to.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Foun­da­tion is col­lab­o­rat­ing with its part­ners, in­clud­ing the AIC and Care Line, to spon­sor new mo­bile phones for the vul­ner­a­ble or so­cially iso­lated se­niors. Care Line is run by Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and pro­vides a tele-be­friend­ing ser­vice, which links se­niors to health and so­cial sup­port in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The AIC spokesman said: “It is im­por­tant for com­mu­nity part­ners to have com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nels to vul­ner­a­ble se­niors, es­pe­cially in the ab­sence of reg­u­lar phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion. Ac­cess to phones will fa­cil­i­tate the de­liv­ery of ser­vices and as­sis­tance to them, as well as pro­vide an av­enue for them to seek help.”</p>
    <p>For a start, the plan is to give away at least 500 An­droid phones be­gin­ning last month and Te­masek Foun­da­tion’s com­mu­nity part­ners will iden­tify the ben­e­fi­cia­ries, dis­trib­ute the phones and teach se­niors how to use them.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim Ah Kheoh, 85, is thank­ful for the phone since it is free. She says she will use it to make calls if she has to.</p>
    <p>The widow, who has no chil­dren and lives alone in a one-room rental flat, did not see the need to own a phone pre­vi­ously as “I don’t like to so­cialise and any­way, no one is look­ing for me”, she said in Hokkien.</p>
    <p>If she needs help or needs to use a phone, she would turn to her neigh­bour. Vol­un­teers and staff from Li­ons Be­frien­ders also check in on her reg­u­larly at her flat.</p>
    <p>MEN­TAL WELL-BE­ING IS­SUES</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of the means to reach out to se­niors, be it on­line or off­line ac­tiv­i­ties, the need to keep them en­gaged for their phys­i­cal and men­tal well-be­ing can­not be over-em­pha­sised, said so­cial work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Anthony Tay, chair­man of Li­ons Be­frien­ders, said his staff no­ticed a grad­ual de­cline in the se­niors’ emo­tional and men­tal well-be­ing when its cen­tres were closed.</p>
    <p>They were also alerted to four sui­cide at­tempts dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. This was up from the av­er­age of one at­tempted sui­cide ev­ery three to six months be­fore the pan­demic, Mr Tay said.</p>
    <p>Care Cor­ner was alerted to two deaths dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, in­clud­ing a se­nior who was found dead at the foot of the block where he lived. He had a his­tory of men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>An­other se­nior was found dead at home, but Care Cor­ner was not privy to the cause of his death.</p>
    <p>Care Cor­ner man­ager (so­cial care) Sharon Tang said: “Many of the se­niors we serve are alone – phys­i­cally and emo­tion­ally. They ei­ther do not have any liv­ing kin, have ac­ri­mo­nious fa­mil­ial re­la­tion­ships or gen­er­ally do not have a good sup­port net­work from their fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“If they do not in­ten­tion­ally step out of their homes and have so­cial in­ter­ac­tion with the com­mu­nity, they are at risk of de­pres­sion and spi­ralling men­tal health is­sues.”</p>
    <p>DIG­I­TAL AM­BAS­SADORS</p>
    <p>The se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres that The Straits Times in­ter­viewed have started tak­ing some of their ac­tiv­i­ties on­line.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Care Cor­ner is talk­ing to spon­sors to fund tablets and data plans for se­niors who can­not af­ford them so that they can join in the vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It is also plan­ning to train 120 se­niors as dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors to rope their friends in to join the Care Cor­ner vir­tual com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Li­ons Be­frien­ders has started a vir­tual be­friend­ing pro­gramme where its cor­po­rate part­ners, in­clud­ing DBS Bank, and stu­dents will con­nect with se­niors through tools such as Zoom.</p>
    <p>Among other plans, the char­ity is work­ing with the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity to teach se­niors dig­i­tal skills – such as us­ing What­sApp and mak­ing e-pay­ments – through the Se­nior Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Touch Com­mu­nity Ser­vices has taken some of its pro­grammes on­line, such as its Happy pro­gramme, Com­mu­nity Nurse Post and stretch-band ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>In Com­mu­nity Nurse Post, nurses mon­i­tor se­niors’ health through Zoom, while the Happy pro­gramme con­sists of phys­i­cal and brain-stim­u­lat­ing ac­tiv­i­ties that are now also con­ducted through Zoom.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh said these on­line pro­grammes are well re­ceived, adding that se­niors will join in when they see that their friends are ben­e­fit­ing from do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres, com­pa­nies and vol­un­teers are also step­ping in to help.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a group of artists from Ar­tify Stu­dio vol­un­teered to teach 20 se­niors from Touch Se­nior Ac­tiv­ity Cen­tre how to paint, through What­sApp video­con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>As OCBC’s head of group brand and com­mu­ni­ca­tions Koh Ching Ching put it: “Vol­un­teer­ing should con­tinue, Covid-19 or no.”</p>
    <p>She added: “Many vul­ner­a­ble se­niors were al­ready deal­ing with iso­la­tion and lone­li­ness be­fore Covid-19. We don’t want Covid-19 to force the dis­en­gage­ment.”</p>
    <p>Hence, the bank’s staff started to work with char­i­ties to conduct livestream ses­sions to in­ter­act with se­niors.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude birth­day cel­e­bra­tions, where a cake is de­liv­ered to the se­nior’s house and vol­un­teers from OCBC in­ter­act with the se­nior through Skype to cel­e­brate the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>The se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres said that while some se­niors are still re­sis­tant to learn­ing new com­mu­ni­ca­tion tools or to join in vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties, the tide is slowly turn­ing as the pan­demic has forced ev­ery­one to adapt their habits to cope with en­forced iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>And that in the days ahead, on­line ac­tiv­i­ties will be part of the new norm, the cen­tres said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Fei Yue Com­mu­nity Ser­vices said: “The old nor­mal may or may not re­turn any time soon. Many of the se­niors will need to ad­just them­selves to be more dig­i­tally plugged in so that they do not be­come so­cially iso­lated fur­ther.”</p>
