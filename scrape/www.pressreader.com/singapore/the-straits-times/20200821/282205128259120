    <p>Shares of Medtecs In­ter­na­tional, a maker of med­i­cal ap­parel, traded at just a few cents at the be­gin­ning of the year be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic roiled fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Now they are up al­most 5,000 per cent.</p>
    <p>Su­per­nor­mal de­mand for es­sen­tial re­us­able hos­pi­tal garb and dis­pos­able per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and work­wear has helped the Taipei-head­quar­tered com­pany’s net in­come grow about 100 times in the six months ended June 30, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>The stock is the top per­former for Sin­ga­pore and among the best in the global health­care sup­ply sec­tor this year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, shares of Catal­istlisted Medtecs closed un­changed at $1.85 from the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>They had started trad­ing this year at 3.7 cents.</p>
    <p>“Profit for the sec­ond half will be bet­ter than that in the first half with cur­rent or­ders in hand,” Medtecs chief ex­ec­u­tive Wil­liam Yang said.</p>
    <p>He added that his firm is help­ing the Philip­pines build its pro­tec­tive equip­ment in­ven­tory and is in talks to sup­ply in­sti­tu­tional agen­cies in the United States and Europe.</p>
    <p>Medtecs’ surge il­lus­trates how the pan­demic has made med­i­cal­re­lated stocks some of Asia’s top per­form­ers. Sin­ga­pore’s dis­pos­able glove­maker UG Health­care has soared 1,827 per cent this year, while Malaysia’s Top Glove has jumped 477 per cent to be­come the big­gest gainer in the MSCI Asia Pa­cific In­dex.</p>
    <p>De­spite the im­pres­sive surge in health­care stocks, in­vestors should as­sess the pace of in­fec­tions and the like­li­hood of a vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped be­fore buy­ing, said Mr Justin Tang, head of Asian re­search at United First Part­ners in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors need to be care­ful be­cause when we get the vac­cine, there will be a sur­plus of things like masks, gloves and other med­i­cal wear,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang’s ad­vice may be worth heed­ing, es­pe­cially as hopes for a treat­ment grow.</p>
    <p>Last week, Rus­sia an­nounced the world’s first Covid-19 vac­cine amid in­ter­na­tional scep­ti­cism, while Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy com­pany Moderna reached a deal with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to sup­ply its ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine to the US.</p>
    <p>Prospects for a cure may al­ready be tak­ing some steam out of the health sec­tor’s eye-pop­ping ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Shares in the world’s big­gest glove-mak­ers, such as Top Glove, Har­talega Hold­ings and Su­per­max, have dropped from their all-time highs reached ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“There is no way that health­care com­pa­nies will be able to sus­tain the Covid-19-led de­mand,” Mr Tang said. “When a vac­cine comes, it will be over.”</p>
