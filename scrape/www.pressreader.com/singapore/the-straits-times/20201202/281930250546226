    <p>•</p>
    <p>The United States has im­posed sanc­tions on a ma­jor Chi­nese elec­tron­ics and en­gi­neer­ing com­pany for as­sist­ing Venezuela in curb­ing dis­sent on the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>The US said on Mon­day it was restrict­ing trans­ac­tions with the China Na­tional Elec­tron­ics Im­port and Ex­port Cor­po­ra­tion (CEIEC), and block­ing as­sets of any firm in which the state-owned com­pany holds a 50 per cent stake or higher.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury Depart­ment said CEIEC pro­vides ex­per­tise to Venezuela’s state-owned telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany – which has blocked in­de­pen­dent me­dia as well as live-stream­ing by op­po­si­tion leader Juan Guaido, who is recog­nised as in­terim pres­i­dent by at least 50 coun­tries, in­clud­ing the US.</p>
    <p>“The United States will not hes­i­tate to tar­get any­one help­ing to sup­press the demo­cratic will of the Venezue­lan peo­ple and oth­ers around the world,” Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin said.</p>
    <p>China is a ma­jor sup­porter and com­mer­cial part­ner of oil-pro­duc­ing Venezuela, help­ing left­ist leader Ni­co­las Maduro sur­vive a nearly two-year US-led cam­paign to top­ple him.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said that CEIEC “has been supporting the Maduro regime’s ma­li­cious ef­forts to re­press po­lit­i­cal dis­sent and un­der­mine demo­cratic pro­cesses since 2017”.</p>
    <p>Venezuela on Sun­day will hold leg­isla­tive elec­tions in which Mr Maduro hopes to take back the Na­tional Assem­bly, the only in­sti­tu­tion con­trolled by the op­po­si­tion, with Mr Guaido boy­cotting what he and sev­eral in­ter­na­tional ob­servers see as a rigged process.</p>
    <p>The Venezue­lan gov­ern­ment, for its part, de­nounced the “il­le­gal ac­tions of the United States gov­ern­ment” that it said seek to desta­bilise the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing slammed the US sanc­tions yes­ter­day as a “pure pre­text to sup­press the rel­e­vant Venezue­lan and Chi­nese com­pa­nies”.</p>
    <p>“We are also firmly op­posed to the abuse of uni­lat­eral sanc­tions and other means to co­erce the Venezue­lan peo­ple to change their de­vel­op­ment path,” Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said at a rou­tine brief­ing.</p>
