    <p>MINSK Be­laru­sian leader Alexan­der Lukashenko yes­ter­day re­sponded de­fi­antly to the Euro­pean Union and the United States which re­fused to recog­nise his in­au­gu­ra­tion as pres­i­dent, cit­ing rigged polls.</p>
    <p>“They’re shout­ing that they don’t recog­nise us,” he said at a meet­ing with Chi­nese Am­bas­sador Cui Qim­ing.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of Western coun­tries have re­fused to ac­knowl­edge Mr Lukashenko as pres­i­dent, fol­low­ing his in­au­gu­ra­tion on Wed­nes­day. He claimed to have won 80 per cent of the vote in Aug 9 polls, de­spite huge sup­port for his op­po­si­tion ri­val Svet­lana Tikhanovsk­aya. The US called the elections “fraud­u­lent”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko in­sisted: “We never asked any­one to recog­nise or not recog­nise our elections, or to recog­nise the le­git­i­macy of the re­elected pres­i­dent or not.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the EU said Mr Lukashenko’s in­au­gu­ra­tion for a sixth term lacked “any demo­cratic le­git­i­macy” and was re­view­ing re­la­tions with Minsk.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Wed­nes­day, the US and Euro­pean coun­tries in­clud­ing Ger­many said they re­fused to recog­nise Mr Lukashenko as the pres­i­dent of the ex-Soviet state as the elections were not free or fair. The non-trans­par­ent bal­lot in­cluded days of early vot­ing while Be­larus failed to in­vite in­ter­na­tional ob­server group OSCE in time.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion has called for fresh elections to be held ac­cord­ing to in­ter­na­tional stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko said of the in­au­gu­ra­tion that “the main thing is that this should cor­re­spond to our coun­try’s Con­sti­tu­tion. And if they see con­tra­dic­tions, let them say so”.</p>
