    <p>With over­seas leisure travel off lim­its for a while, Sin­ga­pore needs to tap lo­cals to sup­port the tourism sec­tor. Jour­nal­ist Tif­fany Fu­miko Tay (be­low) looks at mea­sures needed to make do­mes­tic tourism and food and bev­er­age of­fer­ings at­trac­tive to lo­cal spenders.</p>
    <p>Af­ter four years of pro­pel­ling the Repub­lic’s tourism sec­tor to record heights, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) now faces the daunt­ing chal­lenge of court­ing its tough­est au­di­ence yet: Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic tourism may seem an odd con­cept in a city state that can be tra­versed end to end in un­der two hours. But with the re­sump­tion of leisure over­seas travel far on the hori­zon, it is a key part of the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to stave off mass clo­sures and lay­offs in the tourism sec­tor, which em­ployed about 65,000 work­ers last year.</p>
    <p>Across the globe, na­tions in­clud­ing Thai­land and Ja­pan are en­cour­ag­ing res­i­dents to take do­mes­tic va­ca­tions and travel to other parts of the coun­try, as bor­der clo­sures take a heavy toll on tourism-reliant busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In the Sin­ga­pore con­text, do­mes­tic tourism sim­ply refers to go­ing out and spend­ing money on leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, whether it be a trip to the zoo, a fam­ily stay­ca­tion at a ho­tel, or even din­ing out and vis­its to the mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age this, the Gov­ern­ment is dol­ing out</p>
    <p>$320 mil­lion in tourism vouch­ers to Sin­ga­pore­ans. This is on top of a $45 mil­lion mar­ket­ing cam­paign that aims to con­vince res­i­dents that there is more to dis­cover in their back­yard.</p>
    <p>The con­sid­er­able ef­fort to save the tourism sec­tor from col­lapse re­flects a greater im­por­tance than the 4 per cent it con­trib­utes to Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the sec­tor not only boosts Sin­ga­pore’s at­trac­tive­ness for for­eign in­vest­ment and leisure travel, but also pro­vides leisure ac­tiv­i­ties for res­i­dents and sup­ports re­lated in­dus­tries like re­tail and food and bev­er­age (F&B).</p>
    <p>To drive home the point that tourism props up many ac­tiv­i­ties and busi­nesses that res­i­dents en­joy, STB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan warned Sin­ga­pore­ans last month that their favourite shops, eater­ies and at­trac­tions may soon dis­ap­pear without their sup­port.</p>
    <p>Many have heeded the call, with healthy crowds re­turn­ing to malls, restau­rants and out­door venues in re­cent weeks, even prompt­ing warn­ings against over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment and in­dus­try play­ers have noted that the do­mes­tic mar­ket will not be enough to make up for the tourist short­fall, there is po­ten­tial to off­set a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of their spend­ing, based on the amount res­i­dents spend on travel.</p>
    <p>Last year, some 19 mil­lion vis­i­tors spent $27.7 bil­lion here. That sounds like a huge sum, but con­sider that it is less than what Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­dent pop­u­la­tion spent on over­seas travel last year: $36.5 bil­lion, or US$26.6 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the World Tourism Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>As they can’t travel over­seas dur­ing the pan­demic with bor­ders closed, can Sin­ga­pore­ans be con­vinced to spend a por­tion of their hol­i­day bud­get at home?</p>
    <p>That is the hope for many mar­keters, even though purse strings are tighter dur­ing the cur­rent re­ces­sion. It re­quires tourism-reliant busi­nesses to home in on the pref­er­ences and habits of lo­cal cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>VALUE FOR MONEY</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore shop­pers like value for money, so this is one sure-fire ap­proach to lur­ing them to spend.</p>
    <p>The $45 mil­lion Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign kicked off last month with an ar­ray of 80 pro­mo­tions across cat­e­gories such as din­ing, at­trac­tions and ac­com­mo­da­tion. Ex­am­ples in­clude pack­ages at five-star Sen­tosa ho­tels that come with din­ing vouch­ers and other good­ies, start­ing at up­wards of $500 a night.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are a tough bunch to im­press. Some ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment at the of­fer­ings, which they said were too pricey and lim­ited to pique their in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses lament that it is hard to of­fer steep dis­counts and re­main vi­able, par­tic­u­larly given the cur­rent re­stric­tions. Most at­trac­tions, for ex­am­ple, have a ca­pac­ity limit of 25 per cent to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers, an­nounced last week, will help to pro­vide a form of in­di­rect dis­count­ing and spur spend­ing.</p>
    <p>While de­tails on how and when they will be dis­bursed have yet to be an­nounced, ob­servers es­ti­mate that the amount will most likely work out to about $100 a cit­i­zen.</p>
    <p>Some sug­gested that the amount be split evenly among sec­tors such as F&B and at­trac­tions to en­sure that all ben­e­fit, though they agreed the vouch­ers would be of lit­tle help in the long run to busi­nesses that fail to in­no­vate.</p>
    <p>Apart from dis­counts, im­prov­ing the of­fer­ings is an­other way to lure lo­cal spenders.</p>
    <p>Ngee Ann Polytech­nic se­nior tourism lec­turer Michael Chiam said busi­nesses may have to think up new prod­ucts to in­ter­est res­i­dents, such as back-of-house tours to fa­mil­iar at­trac­tions that pro­vide ac­cess and in­sights to ar­eas that are usu­ally off-lim­its.</p>
    <p>Wax mu­seum Madame Tus­sauds Sin­ga­pore is fac­ing a dou­ble whammy. Not only have tourists dis­ap­peared, but its school and cor­po­rate group book­ings have also dropped off due to lim­its on group sizes, said mar­ket­ing man­ager Florence Maail.</p>
    <p>To help fill the void, the mu­seum cre­ated a new prod­uct for students called Vir­tual Images of Sin­ga­pore. Billed as an in­ter­ac­tive learn­ing jour­ney, it lets view­ers learn about sig­nif­i­cant mo­ments in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory through an on­line por­tal.</p>
    <p>Next month, vis­i­tors to the mu­seum can go be­hind the scenes to ob­serve a wax artist at work, a new ex­pe­ri­ence de­vel­oped to at­tract lo­cal res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Hote­lier and restau­ra­teur</p>
    <p>Loh Lik Peng, di­rec­tor of the Un­listed Col­lec­tion group, said din­ner crowds have re­turned to most of its 18 restau­rants here, not­ing that Sin­ga­pore­ans are “all about good deals”.</p>
    <p>But restau­rants in pop­u­lar tourist ar­eas have re­mained quiet. Jing Seafood Restau­rant, lo­cated at</p>
    <p>One Fuller­ton, has been of­fer­ing one-for-one deals that have helped to boost sales.</p>
    <p>But price dis­count­ing alone is not the way to hook the lo­cal mar­ket, said Mr Loh. “De­liv­er­ing value and giv­ing cus­tomers what they want is much more im­por­tant. It also buys you loy­alty af­ter the cri­sis is over.”</p>
    <p>One way of adding value is through the bundling or cross-pro­mo­tion of prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Pack­ag­ing dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties and ac­com­mo­da­tion within the same area, for ex­am­ple, would also aid the STB in pro­mot­ing precincts as mini-hol­i­day des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>While the idea of pro­mot­ing ar­eas like Chi­na­town and Lit­tle In­dia as des­ti­na­tions for res­i­dents to re­dis­cover was an­nounced as part of the mar­ket­ing cam­paign, it has thus far taken shape only in the form of on­line precinct guides.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Rose Tong said cross-pro­mo­tion can help busi­nesses to grow their base of cus­tomers. “For ex­am­ple, re­tail­ers in kids’ ap­parel and ac­ces­sories could col­lab­o­rate with tu­ition cen­tres or en­rich­ment classes and of­fer a bun­dle deal and gift vouch­ers tied to a pur­chase or class reg­is­tra­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>SPREAD­ING OUT DE­MAND</p>
    <p>En­tic­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to step out and spend is only one part of the chal­lenge com­pa­nies face. Re­ly­ing solely on the do­mes­tic mar­ket means tweak­ing busi­ness hours.</p>
    <p>Nor­mal busi­ness hours may no longer be vi­able, be­cause res­i­dents tend to en­gage in leisure ac­tiv­i­ties on week­ends and hol­i­days, while tourists tra­di­tion­ally even out de­mand dur­ing the week.</p>
    <p>With busi­ness now heav­ily con­cen­trated on the week­ends, cus­tomers may have to be turned away dur­ing busy pe­ri­ods. Stay­ing open dur­ing off-peak times may also cost more than it brings in.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, at­trac­tions such as Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios have cut their op­er­a­tions to seven hours, four days a week.</p>
    <p>One way to even out de­mand is to of­fer tar­geted deals to dif­fer­ent groups, said Dr Chiam. While fam­i­lies with chil­dren are most likely to visit at­trac­tions dur­ing peak hours, oth­ers can be in­cen­tivised to show up dur­ing lull pe­ri­ods, he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Kevin Cheong, chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions, said fo­cus­ing on evening op­er­a­tions could help to draw af­ter-work crowds.</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ing pre-book­ings would also bet­ter en­able busi­nesses to of­fer timed pro­mo­tions and plan for op­er­a­tional needs.</p>
    <p>While work­ing from home has pro­vided con­sumers some flex­i­bil­ity, there is a limit to how much de­mand can be spread out, and op­er­a­tors will have to pare down their hours and costs, said Dr Cheong. “At­trac­tions are likely to scale down to a four- or five-day op­er­at­ing week skewed to­wards the week­end, and run on a sin­gle shift.”</p>
    <p>TOURISM 2.0</p>
    <p>As re­stric­tions on gath­er­ings grad­u­ally ease, tick­eted events could be a way for venues to draw new vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Es­cape game events – where small groups em­bark on puz­zle-solv­ing ad­ven­tures in her­itage-rich ar­eas like Haw Par Villa and Chi­na­town – have proven pop­u­lar among res­i­dents in the past. Last year, Haw Par Villa also teamed up with home-grown party col­lec­tive Ice Cream</p>
    <p>Sun­days to or­gan­ise week­end bashes at the park.</p>
    <p>But with the pan­demic rag­ing on, large-scale phys­i­cal events are un­likely to re­sume any time soon. Dig­i­tal space will be an im­por­tant proxy. This year’s Great Sin­ga­pore Sale, for ex­am­ple, will go vir­tual for the first time and fea­ture live streams and games with prizes to be won.</p>
    <p>But tourists are still es­sen­tial to the sec­tor. While ef­forts to court the lo­cal mar­ket may help some busi­nesses to stay afloat un­til tourists re­turn, ca­su­al­ties will mount if bor­ders do not re­open soon, op­er­a­tors said.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh of Un­listed Col­lec­tion said: “The re­al­ity of a coun­try like Sin­ga­pore is that the do­mes­tic mar­ket is too small to make a sus­tained dent in the tourism pie.”</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong said busi­nesses should use this pe­riod to study the be­hav­iour of the res­i­dent mar­ket so that their pref­er­ences can be bet­ter catered to. Op­er­a­tors should also plan for the fu­ture of tourism, where small-group travel and the use of tech­nol­ogy are likely to be the norm, he added.</p>
    <p>Prod­ucts must be tai­lored for busi­ness trav­ellers, who will be the first to re­turn through green lane ar­range­ments with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Dr Chiam said: “This is a golden op­por­tu­nity for busi­nesses to in­no­vate, test and re­fine their prod­ucts with lo­cals and get ready to of­fer them to tourists when the re­stric­tions are lifted.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are a tough bunch to im­press. Some ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment at the of­fer­ings, which they said were too pricey and lim­ited to pique their in­ter­est. Busi­nesses lament that it is hard to of­fer steep dis­counts and re­main vi­able... given the cur­rent re­stric­tions.</p>
