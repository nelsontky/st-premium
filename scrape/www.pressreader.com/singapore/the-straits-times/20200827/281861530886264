    <p>AT­LANTA • The United States Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) qui­etly mod­i­fied its coro­n­avirus test­ing guide­lines this week to ex­clude peo­ple who do not have symp­toms of Covid-19 – even if they have re­cently been ex­posed to the virus.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts ques­tioned the re­vi­sion, point­ing to the im­por­tance of iden­ti­fy­ing in­fec­tions in the small win­dow im­me­di­ately be­fore the on­set of symp­toms, when many in­di­vid­u­als ap­pear to be most con­ta­gious.</p>
    <p>Mod­els sug­gest that about half of trans­mis­sion events can be traced back to in­di­vid­u­als still in this presymp­tomatic stage, be­fore they start to feel ill – if they ever feel sick at all.</p>
    <p>“This is po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous,” said Dr Kru­tika Kup­palli, an in­fec­tious dis­ease physi­cian in Palo Alto, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Re­strict­ing test­ing to only peo­ple with ob­vi­ous symp­toms of Covid-19 means “you’re not look­ing for a lot of peo­ple who are po­ten­tial spread­ers of dis­ease”, she added.</p>
    <p>“I feel like this is go­ing to make things worse.”</p>
    <p>At a mo­ment when ex­perts have al­most uni­ver­sally come for­ward to en­cour­age more fre­quent and wide­spread test­ing, es­pe­cially to reach vul­ner­a­ble and marginalis­ed sec­tors of the pop­u­la­tion, the CDC’s up­date ap­pears counter-in­tu­itive and “very strange”, said Dr Su­san But­ler-Wu, a clin­i­cal mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist at the Keck School of Medicine of the Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Just weeks ago, the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health an­nounced the first round of grant re­cip­i­ents for its Rapid Ac­cel­er­a­tion of Di­ag­nos­tics pro­gramme, or RADx, to scale up coro­n­avirus test­ing in the com­ing weeks and months.</p>
    <p>On the agency’s RADx web­site, of­fi­cials un­der­score the im­por­tance of pri­ori­tis­ing tests that can “de­tect peo­ple who are asymp­to­matic”.</p>
    <p>A more lax ap­proach to test­ing, ex­perts said, could de­lay cru­cial treat­ments, as well as ob­scure, or even has­ten, the coro­n­avirus’ spread in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Prior it­er­a­tions of the CDC’s test­ing guide­lines struck a markedly dif­fer­ent tone, ex­plic­itly stat­ing that “test­ing is rec­om­mended for all close con­tacts” of peo­ple in­fected with the coro­n­avirus, re­gard­less of symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The agency also specif­i­cally em­pha­sised “the po­ten­tial for asymp­to­matic and pre-symp­to­matic trans­mis­sion” as an im­por­tant fac­tor in the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The new­est ver­sion, which was posted on Mon­day, amended the agency’s guid­ance to say that peo­ple who have been in close con­tact with an in­fected in­di­vid­ual – typ­i­cally de­fined as be­ing within 2m of a per­son with the coro­n­avirus and for at least 15 min­utes – “do not nec­es­sar­ily need a test” if they do not have symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Ex­cep­tions, the agency noted, might be made for “vul­ner­a­ble” in­di­vid­u­als, or if health care providers or state or lo­cal pub­lic health of­fi­cials rec­om­mend test­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr But­ler-Wu said she was con­cerned that the guide­lines would be mis­in­ter­preted as im­ply­ing that peo­ple without symp­toms were un­able to pass the coro­n­avirus on to oth­ers – a false­hood that ex­perts had been try­ing for months to dis­pel.</p>
    <p>The rea­sons be­hind the sur­prise shift in test­ing rec­om­men­da­tions are un­clear. In re­sponse to an in­quiry from The New York Times, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive for the CDC di­rected the ques­tions to the US De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices (HHS).</p>
    <p>An HHS spokesman said that asymp­to­matic test­ing could still be war­ranted “when di­rected by pub­lic health lead­ers or health care providers”, and noted that test­ing de­ci­sions should be “based on in­di­vid­ual cir­cum­stances and the sta­tus of com­mu­nity spread”.</p>
    <p>“We re­vised the guid­ance to re­flect cur­rent ev­i­dence and the best pub­lic health in­ter­ven­tions,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>At a mo­ment when ex­perts have al­most uni­ver­sally come for­ward to en­cour­age more fre­quent and wide­spread test­ing, es­pe­cially to reach vul­ner­a­ble and marginalis­ed sec­tors of the pop­u­la­tion, the CDC’s up­date ap­pears counter-in­tu­itive and</p>
    <p>“very strange”, said Dr Su­san But­ler-Wu, a clin­i­cal mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist at the Keck School of Medicine of the Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
