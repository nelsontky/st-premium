    <p>WASH­ING­TON The next rounds of US pres­i­den­tial de­bates will be “more or­derly”, or­gan­is­ers have promised, as the mod­er­a­tor of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and ri­val Joe Biden’s toxic Cleve­land show­down ad­mit­ted it had gone “off the rails”.</p>
    <p>“Last night’s de­bate made clear that ad­di­tional struc­ture should be added to the for­mat of the re­main­ing de­bates to en­sure a more or­derly dis­cus­sion of the is­sues,” the Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion said it would soon an­nounce mea­sures “to en­sure that ad­di­tional tools to main­tain or­der are in place for the re­main­ing de­bates”.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed a melt­down at the first of three 90-minute clashes be­tween Mr Trump and his Demo­cratic ri­val.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­peat­edly talked over Mr Biden, who be­came ex­as­per­ated and called him a “clown”. At one point, Mr Biden told the Pres­i­dent to “shut up.”</p>
    <p>The mod­er­a­tor, Fox News’s highly ex­pe­ri­enced in­ter­viewer Chris Wal­lace, looked fre­quently lost as he pleaded with Mr Trump in par­tic­u­lar to re­spect the rules agreed to in ad­vance by both cam­paigns. Mr Wal­lace ad­mit­ted that he was not pre­pared for the chaos. “I never dreamt that it would go off the tracks the way it did,” he told The New York Times.</p>
    <p>It had been widely ex­pected that Mr Trump would bring a sim­i­lar style to the one he em­ploys at ral­lies and press con­fer­ences, where his out­size per­son­al­ity and ten­dency to in­sult crit­ics are un­like that of any pres­i­dent in liv­ing mem­ory.</p>
    <p>But Mr Wal­lace said he did not ex­pect such a cease­less bar­rage of in­ter­rup­tions and re­fusal to stick to the agreed for­mat of ques­tions.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 73.1 mil­lion peo­ple in the United States watched the can­di­dates go toe-to-toe on TV on Tues­day night, ac­cord­ing to data firm Nielsen.</p>
