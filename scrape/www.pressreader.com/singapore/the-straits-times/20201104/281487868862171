    <p>Watch­ing the is­land­wide dis­may and be­wil­der­ment over news that the iconic Robin­sons will close its re­main­ing de­part­ment stores, mark­ing a wa­ter­shed mo­ment for Sin­ga­pore re­tail, one is re­minded of a telling com­ment that ap­pears in The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hem­ing­way’s first ma­jor novel.</p>
    <p>In that story, pub­lished in 1926, hard-drink­ing war vet­eran Mike Camp­bell, asked how he went bank­rupt, re­sponds: “Two ways. Grad­u­ally, then sud­denly.”</p>
    <p>No one is sug­gest­ing that Al-Fut­taim, the Dubai group that owns Robin­sons, is go­ing bank­rupt. Nev­er­the­less, there are par­al­lels with Camp­bell’s plight in The Sun Also Rises in the way the for­tunes of Robin­sons’ well-loved stores be­gan to slip – a lit­tle first, then in a rush. On top of it all came Covid-19, crush­ing re­tail as we knew it in an em­phatic way.</p>
    <p>The bricks-and-mor­tar stores, which trace their his­tory back 160 years to an Aus­tralian emi­gre’s en­tre­pre­neur­ial vi­sion, are the lat­est vic­tim of seem­ingly un­stop­pable trends across the spec­trum of in­dus­try, par­tic­u­larly re­tail. Just in this news­pa­per, so much acreage has been used up, in­clud­ing a de­light­ful col­umn from Malavika Menon on Sun­day, by writ­ers who use the In­ter­net to or­der ev­ery­thing from lean-meal choices to work­out items.</p>
    <p>It is not easy to face up to such change, es­pe­cially when there are emo­tions at­tached. As Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo put it, the sense of loss is tremen­dous, es­pe­cially for those to whom Robin­sons was a part of their grow­ing-up years.</p>
    <p>In time to come, ques­tions will be asked over whether Robin­sons had the right strat­egy. For in­stance, could it have been saved by mov­ing into the in­creas­ingly vi­brant sub­urbs of Sin­ga­pore rather than re­tain­ing both its stores in the downtown area? Oth­ers have done so. Sephora, for one, has found its Jurong and Tampines stores to be hand­somely prof­itable, ac­cord­ing to re­tail in­dus­try in­sid­ers.</p>
    <p>AGAINST THE TIDE</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, tra­di­tional re­tail is row­ing against the cur­rent. World­wide, tech­nol­ogy – and chang­ing tastes – is shak­ing up the land­scape.</p>
    <p>Take Sears, Roe­buck & Co, the iconic Amer­i­can mail or­der and re­tail firm that soared on the back of an ex­pand­ing Amer­i­can mid­dle class and the spread of the rail­way and high­way sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen years ago, it merged with Kmart to cre­ate a mas­sive en­tity that could help it ra­tio­nalise mar­ket­ing and sourc­ing costs. The merged com­pany had some 3,500 stores across the United States alone. Two years ago, it filed for Chap­ter 11 bank­ruptcy. To­day, it has closed nine in 10 of those stores, and more will go. Soon, the US will likely have fewer than 200 Sears lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons’ story mir­rors the Sears ex­pe­ri­ence in a way. In 2016, eight years after it was bought by Al-Fut­taim for $600 mil­lion, the West Asian group, which also owns other fran­chises such as John Lit­tle and Bebe, an­nounced that it would be clos­ing 10 or more stores in Sin­ga­pore, cit­ing the chal­leng­ing re­tail en­vi­ron­ment. Last week’s an­nounce­ment, there­fore, was not wholly un­ex­pected. Rather, it was an in­evitabil­ity.</p>
    <p>Across the re­tail in­dus­try, Hem­ing­way’s “sud­denly” mo­ment is re­peat­ing in myr­iad ways. The ar­rival of the World Wide Web and its mor­ph­ing from a search plat­form into a com­mer­cial op­por­tu­nity was clearly the first big event, a warning rat­tle as it turned out. Many sensed the big changes loom­ing but were un­sure how to tackle them. From banks like JPMor­gan Chase to de­part­ment stores like Sears, ini­tially, many sought strength in size to with­stand the on­slaught and re­tain clien­tele.</p>
    <p>That first big shift has now ac­cel­er­ated into a tsunami that com­bines big data, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI), al­go­rithms and even sen­sors that can track your at­ten­tion lev­els and di­rec­tion. Ex­cit­ing new com­pa­nies have emerged to meet this sit­u­a­tion. France’s Cri­teo SA, for in­stance, spe­cialises in “re­tar­get­ing” – chas­ing cus­tomers, who had looked at a prod­uct on­line but moved away, un­til they ei­ther bought the prod­uct or AI sug­gested that it was a fu­tile ex­er­cise with the par­tic­u­lar cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>KNOW­ING YOUR CUS­TOMER</p>
    <p>Cri­teo chief ex­ec­u­tive Me­gan Clarken re­cently told me re­search in­di­cates that 55 per cent of shop­pers in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion have down­loaded at least one shop­ping app since Covid-19 ar­rived on the land­scape. What’s more, stud­ies she cited sug­gest that eight in 10 con­sumers have tried new brands for each need and they are un­likely to re­turn to the old ones.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are also tweak­ing prod­ucts for in­di­vid­ual needs and, in­creas­ingly, deal­ing di­rectly with cus­tomers. The more they cut out mid­dle en­ti­ties such as deal­ers and stores, the higher their mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Take Ja­pan’s Shi­seido, Asia’s big­gest cos­met­ics com­pany. Three years ago, it bought a Sil­i­con Val­ley firm that came up with an idea to use smart­phones fit­ted with LEDs that sense the colour of your skin, which would then send a sig­nal to a lab­o­ra­tory. The three pri­mary colours can then be mixed to match your skin colour per­fectly.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, it is a prod­uct, but it is (also) a ser­vice of­fer and new busi­ness model,” CEO</p>
    <p>Masahiko Uotani told me last year. “We can send it straight to your home and your data is stored in our com­put­ers. Three months later, if you come to us, we can tell you how it is work­ing and, there­after, take you to the next level of per­son­alised so­lu­tions. That’s prob­a­bly the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>In­cred­i­bly, Shi­seido has part­nered Chi­nese e-com­merce ti­tan Alibaba, with an eye to at­tract­ing wealthy cus­tomers on the main­land, par­tic­u­larly those from Gen Z. It has a per­fectly rea­son­able ex­pla­na­tion for link­ing up its pre­mium prod­uct with a plat­form that serves mass mar­kets; while Alibaba does have a low-end of­fer­ing, it is also fo­cused on grow­ing high-end brands. So, Shi­seido gives them even Cle de Peau Beaute, its top-end prod­uct.</p>
    <p>And Alibaba knows how to pre­cisely tar­get the af­flu­ent among its 500 mil­lion cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>There are other trends, “ecoanx­i­ety” for one, that are in­flu­enc­ing re­tail. Hence the pop­u­lar­ity of brands like</p>
    <p>Patag­o­nia, so pop­u­lar with the Wall Street crowd and Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>From sell­ing fleece and puffer vests to any­body, Patag­o­nia’s fo­cus has shifted to “mis­sion-driven com­pa­nies that pri­ori­tise the planet”. Its mis­sion state­ment, up­dated last year, says: “We’re in busi­ness to save our home planet.”</p>
    <p>THE MARIE KONDO EF­FECT</p>
    <p>A re­lated trend with buy­ers is the in­stinct for de­clut­ter­ing, which some in the trade call the Marie Kondo ef­fect.</p>
    <p>It is no longer fash­ion­able to shop a la Imelda Mar­cos or Ros­mah Man­sor, even with le­git­i­mate money. Peo­ple find pur­pose in hav­ing 10 or a dozen pairs of trousers, per­haps, and see the next dozen as mean­ing­less vain­glory. Such trends weigh on ag­gre­gate de­mand and slow mar­ket ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>So, does all this mean the end of</p>
    <p>The lines snaking out in front of Robin­sons stores last week fol­low­ing the clo­sure an­nounce­ment may have pro­vided cheer to old-style re­tail­ers that all is not lost. They’d be fool­ish though, if they don’t read the writ­ing on the wall, or stop look­ing for new ways to bring foot­fall in.</p>
    <p>the bricks-and-mor­tar re­tail store? Yes, and no.</p>
    <p>What is clear is that the old model where ad­ver­tis­ing and me­dia were used to drive the cus­tomer to shop at the mall has yielded to a sit­u­a­tion where the plat­form in­creas­ingly is the mall.</p>
    <p>But stores still have value as venues where cus­tomers can soak them­selves in a brand, ex­am­ine its ev­ery de­tail and then choose where to buy, whether in the store it­self, off a plat­form or from the duty-free shop on their next over­seas travel. Ap­ple doesn’t mind if you buy its iPhones off Lazada, as long as you stay loyal to the brand and not move to Sam­sung.</p>

They’d be fool­ish though, if they don’t read the writ­ing on the wall, or stop look­ing for new ways to bring foot­fall in.</p>
    <p>Six decades ago, then Sen­a­tor John F. Kennedy, later US pres­i­dent, writ­ing in his Pulitzer Prize-win­ning book Pro­files In Courage, bor­rowed from The Dachshund, writ­ten by an anony­mous poet, to il­lus­trate how some peo­ple are slow to catch a mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“There was a dachshund once, so long</p>
    <p>He hadn’t any no­tion</p>
    <p>How long it took to no­tify</p>
    <p>His tail of his emo­tion;</p>
    <p>And so it hap­pened, while his eyes Were filled with woe and sad­ness, His lit­tle tail went wag­ging on Be­cause of pre­vi­ous glad­ness.”</p>
