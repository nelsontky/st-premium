    <p>A new flood pro­tec­tion bar­rier is be­ing tri­alled by na­tional wa­ter agency PUB in prepa­ra­tion for heavy rain­storms and flash floods dur­ing mon­soon sea­sons.</p>
    <p>The new de­vice, known as Flood­gate, is the lat­est ad­di­tion to a reper­toire of flood bar­ri­ers which can be quickly de­ployed to pro­tect homes and build­ings in the event of a flash flood, PUB said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Made from high-strength steel frames wrapped in a wa­ter­proof rub­ber sleeve, the de­vice is ex­pand­able and can be in­stalled at the en­trances of res­i­den­tial, com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial premises.</p>
    <p>Suit­able for wider door­ways, Flood­gate of­fers the public more flex­i­bil­ity in choos­ing a bar­rier to be placed in front of their premises.</p>
    <p>The de­vice is avail­able in dif­fer­ent sizes, each with a fixed height of 0.68m and widths rang­ing from 0.77m to 1.52m. The units can also be linked to­gether to cre­ate longer sec­tions to fit wider en­trances, such as shopfronts.</p>
    <p>Each unit will cost be­tween $800 and $2,200, de­pend­ing on its size.</p>
    <p>To test its ef­fec­tive­ness, 20 pieces were pur­chased from Bri­tain in Septem­ber, with 15 cur­rently be­ing tried out by res­i­dents in Up­per Paya Le­bar Road in the cur­rent mon­soon sea­son.</p>
    <p>With the north-east mon­soon sea­son ex­pect­ing to per­sist for an­other month or so, the fre­quent rain­storms may cause flash floods in ar­eas where the ca­pac­ity of the drainage sys­tem is over­whelmed, par­tic­u­larly in low-ly­ing ones, said PUB.</p>
    <p>The north-east mon­soon sea­son lasts from De­cem­ber to early March, though its wet phase is typ­i­cally from De­cem­ber to early Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>This year, there have been seven days of flash floods in Sin­ga­pore, due to very in­tense rain­fall within a short pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent flash flood oc­curred on Nov 7, when heavy rain over­whelmed road­side drains along Alju­nied Road, caus­ing runoff to ac­cu­mu­late on the road for around 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore, the high­est daily to­tal rain­fall recorded that day was 100.2mm in Tan­jong Ka­tong – the sec­ond-high­est recorded in a day for the first half of Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>As at Tues­day, the high­est daily rain­fall to­tal this year was 185.2mm, recorded on Jan 29 at Jurong Is­land.</p>
    <p>Since last year, PUB has be­gun loan­ing out two types of por­ta­ble flood bar­ri­ers to homes and shop­houses in flood-prone and low-ly­ing ar­eas, as part of its ef­forts to en­hance its flood re­sponse ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>These in­clude ex­tend­able pan­els, known as the Dam Easy Flood Pan­els, which are suit­able for door­ways prone to flood wa­ter. Each equipped with an in­flat­able seal, they are around 0.6m high, and can be ad­justed to fit a door­way rang­ing from 0.78m to 1.1m.</p>
    <p>They weigh around 20kg each and cost $1,200 per set.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond type is por­ta­ble flood bar­ri­ers, which can be erected on roads and pave­ments by cre­at­ing a 0.5m dam to di­vert or con­tain flood wa­ter away from an area.</p>
    <p>Each set con­sists of 10 sec­tions, which are around 3.4kg each and can ex­tend to 6m in length.</p>
    <p>So far, 65 pieces of Dam Easy Flood Pan­els and 155 pieces of por­ta­ble flood bar­ri­ers have been loaned out.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo Keng Soon, PUB’s di­rec­tor of the Catch­ment and Wa­ter­ways Depart­ment, said: “Flash floods these days are more lo­calised and typ­i­cally sub­side within 30 min­utes. How­ever, we are see­ing more fre­quent rain­fall events that... (in­crease) rain­wa­ter and (bring about) more in­tense storms. With cli­mate change, we must be pre­pared to... en­hance com­mu­nity re­silience to flash flood oc­cur­rences as it is not al­ways pos­si­ble to widen or deepen our drains to elim­i­nate floods.</p>
    <p>“PUB is con­stantly look­ing out for new solutions and de­vices to bet­ter en­able res­i­dents and busi­nesses to re­spond to flash floods and min­imise po­ten­tial dam­age to their premises.”</p>
