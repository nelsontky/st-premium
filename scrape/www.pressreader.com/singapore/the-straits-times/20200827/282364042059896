    <p>LIONEL MESSI MAY LEAVE BARCELONA FOR FREE, AF­TER MAK­ING TRANS­FER RE­QUEST</p>
    <p>BARCELONA • When Barcelona con­firmed they had re­ceived a re­quest from Lionel Messi’s lawyers in­form­ing them that he wanted to ter­mi­nate one of foot­ball’s long­est-stand­ing re­la­tion­ships, the own­ers of Europe’s big­gest clubs would have raised a col­lec­tive eye­brow.</p>
    <p>It was akin to the Mona Lisa sud­denly be­com­ing avail­able on the art mar­ket, such is his sta­tus in the game de­spite the fact that he is 33.</p>
    <p>Al­ready the usual sus­pects are be­ing lined up as his next club with, not sur­pris­ingly, a re­union with his for­mer man­ager Pep Guardi­ola at Manch­ester City the most likely sce­nario, ac­cord­ing to the book­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Messi has made no se­cret of his ad­mi­ra­tion for the English top flight and link­ing up with his men­tor seems to be the most log­i­cal fit.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola would surely rel­ish the rekin­dling of their part­ner­ship as he re­builds a side eclipsed by Liver­pool last sea­son.</p>
    <p>Barca great Ri­valdo told Bet­fair yes­ter­day that the Ar­gentina skip­per would trans­form City’s bid to win a first Cham­pi­ons League ti­tle de­spite be­com­ing foot­ball’s first bil­lion-dol­lar team since the Abu Dhabi takeover 12 years ago.</p>
    <p>“It will be a sad end­ing for Messi’s story with Barcelona if the things re­main this way, but this is foot­ball and some­times things don’t run ac­cord­ing to our ex­pec­ta­tions,” the for­mer Brazil for­ward said.</p>
    <p>“City could be Messi’s best op­tion as his next club... I imag­ine Guardi­ola build­ing the rest of his team around Messi. His tal­ent can make the dif­fer­ence any place, any time.”</p>
    <p>There is also talk of Messi join­ing forces with Cris­tiano Ron­aldo, his ri­val as the world’s great­est player, at Ju­ven­tus, al­though it is hard to see the Ital­ian Se­rie A cham­pi­ons hav­ing both play­ers on their wage bill.</p>
    <p>Given his enor­mous salary – said to be €1 mil­lion (S$1.6 mil­lion) per week – a more plau­si­ble des­ti­na­tion would be to join for­mer Barca team­mate Ney­mar at Paris Sain­tGer­main, an­other bil­lion-dol­lar side af­ter the Qatari buy­out in 2011.</p>
    <p>While Span­ish daily Marca yes­ter­day claimed the French cham­pi­ons are not in con­tention for his sig­na­ture, coach Thomas Tuchel last Sun­day said the Barca cap­tain would be “very wel­come” in Paris.</p>
    <p>In­ter Mi­lan, backed by China’s Sun­ing Hold­ings, could also emerge as dark horses, though The In­de­pen­dent yes­ter­day re­ported “an agree­ment will be dif­fi­cult to reach” due to his wages on top of the worl­drecord fee Barca will de­mand.</p>
    <p>The clam­our to land the six-time Bal­lon d’Or win­ner has, how­ever, led to plenty of on­line trolling.</p>
    <p>For­mer Manch­ester United de­fender and pun­dit Rio Fer­di­nand yes­ter­day jok­ingly tweeted “Frank Lam­pard is now in for Messi”, re­fer­ring to Chelsea’s ag­gres­sive moves in this trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>A-League side Ade­laide United yes­ter­day also is­sued a long-shot bid to en­tice Messi to join their ranks, tout­ing the city as a coro­n­avirus safe haven for play­ing and rais­ing his fam­ily.</p>
