    </section>

    <p>Some ST Face­book users re­acted hap­pily to news of Hong Kong bak­ery Hang He­ung open­ing its first over­seas shop in Sin­ga­pore by say­ing that they liked its wife cakes. But a few had doubts about the pos­si­ble price range, with Ang Ang say­ing: “Open in Orchard and we are going to pay their rent on their behalf. Doesn’t re­ally make ‘cents’.” John Wan said: “My money only spend at lo­cal shops. Support lo­cal dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times.”</p>
    <p>This year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade song per­former Nathan Hartono had to as­sert he is Sin­ga­porean as peo­ple ques­tioned why a “for­eigner” was singing it. Many ST on­line read­ers stood with him. El Lim com­mented: “Sad that he even needs to an­nounce this fact and jus­tify it to the key­board war­riors.”</p>
