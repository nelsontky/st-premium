    <p>The US govern­ment’s top eco­nomic ad­viser has said the coun­try’s trade deal with China is “fine”, with</p>
    <p>China in­creas­ing its pur­chase of Amer­i­can goods. He dis­missed con­cerns that ris­ing ten­sions be­tween the two coun­tries might jeop­ar­dise the deal.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The trade deal is “fine” and China is “sub­stan­tially” in­creas­ing pur­chases of Amer­i­can goods, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s top eco­nomic ad­viser Larry Kud­low said, dis­miss­ing con­cerns that ris­ing ten­sions be­tween the two coun­tries might jeop­ar­dise the deal.</p>
    <p>The “one area we are en­gag­ing is trade”, Mr Kud­low told a White House news con­fer­ence on Tues­day. “It’s fine right now.”</p>
    <p>China con­tin­ued to prom­ise to im­ple­ment the phase one trade deal and the ev­i­dence showed the coun­try was in­creas­ing US pur­chases, espe­cially of com­modi­ties, Mr Kud­low said.</p>
    <p>The con­tin­ued di­a­logue on trade con­trasts with in­creas­ing spats be­tween the two na­tions. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has stepped up its cam­paign against China in re­cent weeks, bet­ting that a hard line against Bei­jing could help the Pres­i­dent win a sec­ond term in Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s ac­tions have in­cluded sanc­tion­ing Chi­nese in­di­vid­u­als con­nected with hu­man rights abuses in the coun­try’s west­ern re­gion of Xin­jiang, as well as of­fi­cials for their roles in cur­tail­ing free­doms in Hong Kong. Mr Trump has also taken steps to ban Chi­nese apps Tik­Tok and WeChat. The con­sulates of both coun­tries have been or­dered closed by each other’s govern­ments.</p>
    <p>Even as China keeps re­turn­ing fire at the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, the coun­try’s diplo­mats are sig­nalling that they want to ease ten­sions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Deputy Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Le Yucheng said he was ready at any time to talk to his Amer­i­can coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>The trade deal of­fers hope that the two coun­tries can con­tinue to work to­gether. In Jan­uary, China promised to buy an ex­tra US$200 bil­lion (S$274.5 bil­lion) of US goods and ser­vices over the 2017 level by the end of next year. That agree­ment paused a bruis­ing trade war be­tween the world’s two largest economies, al­though the re­la­tion­ship has de­te­ri­o­rated on al­most ev­ery other front since then.</p>
    <p>As of the end of June, China had bought about 23 per cent of the to­tal 2020 pur­chase tar­get of more than US$170 bil­lion of goods, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg cal­cu­la­tions based on Chi­nese data. Se­nior Amer­i­can and Chi­nese of­fi­cials are plan­ning to as­sess the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the trade agree­ment on or around Satur­day.</p>
