    <p>TOKYO • Masked sumo fans sit­ting apart from each other cheered on their favourite wrestlers in per­son for the first time in five months yes­ter­day, as the sport’s de­layed July tour­na­ment started in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, an event orig­i­nally planned for May was can­celled, while March’s Spring Grand Tour­na­ment in Osaka was held be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>The July meet was de­layed by two weeks after be­ing moved from its usual lo­ca­tion in Nagoya, in cen­tral Ja­pan, back to the cap­i­tal to re­duce the risk of in­fec­tion posed by travel.</p>
    <p>The J apan Sumo As­so­ci­a­tion (JSA) is let­ting in about 2,500 fans a day dur­ing the two-week tour­na­ment at Ryo­goku Kokugikan, which has a ca­pac­ity of 11,000.</p>
    <p>Fans have al­ready at­tended base­ball and foot­ball matches in Ja­pan, un­der gov­ern­ment guide­lines al­low­ing up to 5,000 peo­ple at sport­ing and other events since July 10.</p>
    <p>The JSA has pro­hib­ited wrestlers from go­ing out­doors un­less nec­es­sary and to re­strict train­ing to their home sta­bles.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, grand cham­pion Hakuho opened his ac­count with a win, while fel­low yokozuna Kakuryu fell to the dirt to start the tour­na­ment with a loss.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tors at­tend­ing the tour­na­ment must wear masks and sit in­di­vid­u­ally in seat­ing boxes that usu­ally ac­com­mo­date four peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In May, a 28-year-old sumo wrestler be­came in­fected with the coro­n­avirus and died from mul­ti­ple or­gan fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more Ja­panese peo­ple are not sat­is­fied with the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic now com­pared with a month ago as in­fec­tions in the coun­try in­crease, a poll showed.</p>
    <p>About 60 per cent of re­spon­dents said they were not happy with ac­tions taken by Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s ad­min­is­tra­tion to tackle the out­break, ac­cord­ing to the poll con­ducted last Satur­day by the Mainichi news­pa­per and So­cial Sur­vey Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous sur­vey, done in June, had about half of re­spon­dents ex­press­ing dis­sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily in­fec­tions in Tokyo reached records for two con­sec­u­tive days last week. Yes­ter­day, Tokyo con­firmed 188 new cases, na­tional broad­caster NHK re­ported, cit­ing an uniden­ti­fied of­fi­cial, bring­ing the to­tal of in­fec­tions con­firmed in the cap­i­tal to 9,411 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The ap­proval rat­ing for Mr Abe’s Cab­i­net fell by 4 per­cent­age points to 32 per cent, while the dis­ap­proval rat­ing rose to 60 per cent, the poll showed.</p>
    <p>About 67 per cent of re­spon­dents said pre­vent­ing in­fec­tions should take pri­or­ity over eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties, while 15 per cent said other­wise.</p>
    <p>Of those sur­veyed, 64 per cent said the gov­ern­ment should de­clare a lo­calised state of emer­gency, while 20 per cent said it should be na­tion­wide, and 12 per cent were against it in any form.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of re­spon­dents cau­tioned against a gov­ern­ment-led cam­paign to help the do­mes­tic tourism in­dus­try by of­fer­ing dis­count vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign, which is sched­uled to start on Wed­nes­day, came un­der fire on con­cern that it could fuel the spread of in­fec­tions across the na­tion.</p>
