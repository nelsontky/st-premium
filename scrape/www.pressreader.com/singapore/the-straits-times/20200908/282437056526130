    <p>RE­VIEW /</p>
    <p>Daniel Kok & Miho Shimizu Hosted on Zoom</p>
    <p>Aug 15</p>
    <p>Adapted for the on­line space, xhe (on­line) has re­tained the orig­i­nal work’s du­ra­tional and live na­ture. It is cre­ated from an ear­lier work ti­tled xhe, which last played in Sin­ga­pore as part of The Esplanade’s da:ns fes­ti­val 2018.</p>
    <p>At five hours long, au­di­ences are wel­come to en­ter and exit as they like, with clear in­struc­tions for when they may choose to par­tic­i­pate by turn­ing their cam­eras off and on.</p>
    <p>Hosted on the Zoom plat­form, xhe (on­line) at­tempts to re­vive a sense of so­cial con­nec­tion, even across in­ter­na­tional bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Pro­nounced “zhee” or like “j’y” in French, xhe is the pro­noun for the mul­ti­ple, the queer. In these times where our do­mes­tic spa­ces host not only our pri­vate lives, but also work lives, school lives, and other as­pects more typ­i­cally com­part­men­talised, the feel­ing of be­ing blended and hy­brid might be more univer­sal than ever.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple feel iso­lated, oth­ers over­crowded, in their homes. For the five hours of xhe (on­line), vis­ual mad­ness and au­ral de­light come to­gether al­most as a re­flec­tion of our times.</p>
    <p>Eyes ex­hausted from look­ing at all the colour or the trippy black and white per­cep­tual il­lu­sions? Look away, do your thing, just en­joy the sounds by artist Zai Tang, with some sounds sam­pled from the live per­for­mance with elec­tronic duo Fi­las­tine and Nova.</p>
    <p>When one re­turns to the screen, at­ten­tion re­freshed, per­haps the per­form­ers would sud­denly be mov­ing rigidly among pris­matic ob­jects. Be­fore, they might have been ca­ress­ing bright pink fur, or tun­nelling down a sil­ver tube, seen through the cam­era lens as though one were fall­ing through a python’s gul­let.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, the dancers vi­brate and shake, as though in a list­less trance. The per­form­ers’ world is clut­tered with colour­ful and soft ob­jects, and the hu­mans fre­quently en­twine or bur­row into odd round blobs or squishy prisms – the body dis­ap­pear­ing, like ants, into a wild jun­gle.</p>
    <p>Rain­for­est sounds might be played and this psy­che­delic, pop-art-like world feels oddly non-ar­ti­fi­cial, but per­fectly nat­u­ral, trop­i­cal and wild.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the show, au­di­ences are in­vited to change their Zoom back­ground to the vis­ual world of xhe, and to turn on our cam­eras pe­ri­od­i­cally.</p>
    <p>When some­one ap­pears on the screen for the first time, a smile spreads across this au­di­ence mem­ber’s face. Per­haps it is the vis­ual ef­fect of them­selves blur­ring into the xhe back­ground, or the unique plea­sure of re­al­is­ing one is sud­denly seen by strangers dis­persed across the world, live, in a mo­ment of ca­ma­raderie.</p>
    <p>I strug­gle to de­cide if I feel ready to ap­pear on­line – I am not. One by one, oth­ers ap­pear, some with their own xhe-in­spired art­work on dis­play, oth­ers show­ing a pas­tiche of ob­jects in their own home.</p>
    <p>The in­di­vid­ual rooms blend to­gether into a col­lage, a clash of colours and pat­terns as one Zoom screen turns into three, five, 18, more. We are wo­ven to­gether by the strange fab­ric of our times, our lives re­liant on the sin­gu­lar plat­form Zoom, the In­ter­net, and the vi­cis­si­tudes of this new virus.</p>
    <p>This per­for­mance feels like a re­lief, as it seems like an in­vi­ta­tion i nto a dream state, to rest amid the ca­cophonous bod­ies and images and sounds.</p>
