(July 5)

(Nov 30)

• Dubbed the Sturgeon Moon as the sturgeon fish is usually caught at this time of the year in the lakes. (Oct 31) Named the Cold Moon as it occurs at the start of the winter season. Not every day that I have the blues Another spooky-looking moon phenomenon is appropriat­ely named the During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth blocks sunlight from directly reaching the moon. As the Sun’s rays pass through our atmosphere, only red light cuts through largely unaffected, giving the moon its reddish tinge. LUNAR FACTS Older than you think The Metonic cycle Runaway moon A treat for everyone This Halloween moon will be the first since 1944 when nearly all the time zones in the world will experience a full moon. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first reference to the blue moon was made in a 1528 proverb: The moon, with the help of Earth’s rotation energy, is slowly moving farther away from Earth each year, at a rate of about Moon phases recur on the same day of the year approximat­ely in a 19-year loop. If they say the moon is blue, we must believe that it is true. Hence, the next Halloween full moons will be in 2039, 2058, 2077 and so on.
