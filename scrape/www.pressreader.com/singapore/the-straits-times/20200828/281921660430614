    <p>BAL­TI­MORE • US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence has cast the re-election of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump as crit­i­cal to pre­serv­ing law and or­der and economic vi­a­bil­ity, as­sert­ing that Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den would set Amer­ica on a path to so­cial­ism and de­cline.</p>
    <p>Amid widen­ing protests over the Wis­con­sin po­lice shoot­ing of Mr Ja­cob Blake, a black man, Mr Pence and other Repub­li­cans at their na­tional con­ven­tion de­scribed the Nov 3 election be­tween Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den as a choice be­tween law and or­der and law­less­ness.</p>
    <p>“The hard truth is you won’t be safe in Joe Bi­den’s Amer­ica,” Mr Pence told a crowd seated in fold­ing chairs at his­toric Fort McHenry in Bal­ti­more on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­nied by First Lady Me­la­nia Trump, Mr Trump j oined Mr Pence on stage af­ter the speech as the crowd chanted “four more years”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, shot Mr Blake, 29, mul­ti­ple times in the back at close range on Sun­day, reignit­ing protests against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity that erupted across the United States ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a third night of un­rest on Tues­day, three peo­ple were shot, two fa­tally. A teenager was ar­rested on homi­cide charges.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Pence said: “Let me be clear: the vi­o­lence must stop – whether in Min­neapo­lis, Port­land or Kenosha. Too many he­roes have died de­fend­ing our free­dom to see Amer­i­cans strike each other down. We will have law and or­der on the streets of this coun­try for every Amer­i­can of every race and creed and colour.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said ear­lier that he had spo­ken with Mr Blake’s fam­ily on Wed­nes­day and, like the fam­ily, called for an end to the vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence spoke at the Fort McHenry Na­tional Mon­u­ment in Bal­ti­more, Mary­land – a fed­eral fa­cil­ity that is the site of the bat­tle dur­ing the War of 1812 that in­spired Francis Scott Key to write The StarS­pan­gled Ban­ner.</p>
    <p>US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence spoke at the Fort McHenry Na­tional Mon­u­ment in Bal­ti­more – a fed­eral fa­cil­ity that is the site of the bat­tle dur­ing the War of 1812 that in­spired Francis Scott Key to write The Star-Span­gled Ban­ner. Mr Pence sought to re­shape the nar­ra­tive around the econ­omy, cast­ing the mil­lions of jobs lost to the pan­demic as a tem­po­rary set­back. De­spite lag­ging be­hind Mr Bi­den in opinion polls, Mr Trump gets higher marks as a stew­ard of the econ­omy than his Demo­cratic ri­val does.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence sought to re­shape the nar­ra­tive around the econ­omy, cast­ing the mil­lions of jobs lost to the pan­demic as a tem­po­rary set­back.</p>
    <p>De­spite lag­ging be­hind Mr Bi­den in opinion polls, Mr Trump gets higher marks as a stew­ard of the econ­omy than his Demo­cratic ri­val does.</p>
    <p>“Last week, Joe Bi­den said ‘no mir­a­cle is com­ing’. What Joe doesn’t seem to un­der­stand is that Amer­ica is a na­tion of mir­a­cles and we’re on track to have the world’s first safe, ef­fec­tive coro­n­avirus vac­cine by the end of this year,” Mr Pence said.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump set our na­tion on a path to free­dom and op­por­tu­nity from the very first day of this ad­min­is­tra­tion. But Joe Bi­den would set Amer­ica on a path of so­cial­ism and de­cline,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence was put in charge of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse in the pan­demic’s early days, al­though Mr Trump quickly be­came the face of the White House re­sponse and was crit­i­cised for min­imis­ing the threat from the virus.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal fall­out also hit Mr Trump’s re-election cam­paign, cut­ting into his sup­port in opinion polls, which show that Amer­i­cans trust Mr Bi­den, 77, more than Mr Trump, 74, to han­dle the pan­demic.</p>
