    <p>While the sound of pass­ing trains is but a mem­ory and the tracks have been re­moved, a dif­fer­ent kind of travel is now pos­si­ble on the trail for­merly oc­cu­pied by the KTM rail­way in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>At present, a 5km stretch in the cen­tral sec­tion of the Rail Cor­ri­dor – with a short de­tour half­way through – is open af­ter re­fur­bish­ment, said the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The Rail Cor­ri­dor – also known as the green cor­ri­dor – is set to be fully ready in 2025. It will form one of the is­land’s long­est un­bro­ken stretches of green, span­ning 24km from Wood­lands in the north to Tan­jong Pa­gar in the south.</p>
    <p>The line be­gan op­er­a­tions dur­ing the colo­nial pe­riod i n the 1930s. The last train de­parted from Tan­jong Pa­gar Rail­way Sta­tion on June 30, 2011, with Malaysia re­turn­ing the land oc­cu­pied by the Kere­tapi Tanah Me­layu (KTM) rail­way to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With the rail tracks gone, the stretch of land has now be­come an es­cape from ur­ban life: The for­mer tran­sit cor­ri­dor has been re­pur­posed by the peo­ple and an­i­mals liv­ing along its length.</p>
    <p>While large sec­tions of the south­ern half of the cor­ri­dor are still be­ing re­fur­bished, the north­ern sec­tion has re­mained open and largely un­al­tered since the tracks were re­moved in 2011.</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Teo, 64, a pas­tor, and his wife, Mrs Noe­line Teo, 58, use the cor­ri­dor to slip away from city life. “We have been walk­ing up and down this stretch for five or six years. It gives us a feel of the kam­pung life when we were kids; the chick­ens and the wild dogs and every­thing,” said Mrs Teo, a church coun­sel­lor.</p>
    <p>Rain or shine, the cou­ple walk through the Wood­lands area up to Kranji Reser­voir ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>They are joined by a mot­ley crew of reg­u­lars, such as Mr An­drew Vine, 57, a com­pany direc­tor who has been walk­ing 10km a day along</p>
    <p>the Rail Cor­ri­dor since April 14, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I’ve lived along the Rail Cor­ri­dor for 27 years and the train used to go by my house ev­ery day,” he said.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing the cor­ri­dor gives him a sense of calm that can­not be found in the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing out here, you’d never guess that this is (one of the most densely pop­u­lated cities) in the world,” said the Bri­tish na­tional, who is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Be­sides of­fer­ing es­cape from the var­i­ous stresses of ur­ban liv­ing, the cor­ri­dor has a long­stand­ing con­nec­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory as a mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ate stu­dent Vithya Subramania­m, 31, said: “One of the things I no­ticed walk­ing down here is how many tem­ples we passed, and how these places used to be con­nected by this tran­sit link. Now, be­cause it’s out of use, we don’t re­alise it.”</p>
    <p>The trail passes places of wor­ship for all the ma­jor re­li­gions in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing the for­mer lo­ca­tion of the Sri Than­davaalam Muneeswara­n Alayam shrine, which was built by KTM work­ers over 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>The shrine was forced to move from its orig­i­nal lo­ca­tion un­der a fly­over at the in­ter­sec­tion of Queensway and Ports­down Av­enue in 2017.</p>
    <p>The re­de­vel­op­ment of the south­ern sec­tion has been met with mixed re­views from reg­u­lar users.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on the re­place­ment of the dirt trail with what the URA calls “a por­ous earth-coloured ma­te­rial”, which re­sem­bles play­ground floor­ing, re­tired odd job labourer Seow Ah Suay, 72, said: “I like the new road be­cause it is clean, but the whole at­trac­tion of the place was that it was nat­u­ral, bumpy and dirty.”</p>
    <p>What­ever the fu­ture holds for the Rail Cor­ri­dor, it seem to have an un­canny abil­ity to make a Sin­ga­pore obsessed with progress look back with nos­tal­gia.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Teo, who is a for­mer overseas mis­sion­ary: “Our chil­dren are grown up and live overseas. Af­ter liv­ing in other coun­tries – Ja­pan and the United States – for so long, we never ex­pected to be back in Sin­ga­pore without them.</p>
    <p>“This place now re­minds us of how we grew up.”</p>
