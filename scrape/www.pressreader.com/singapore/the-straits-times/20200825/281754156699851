    <p>The Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) has is­sued stop work or­ders to 13 con­struc­tion sites where work­ers from Sungei Ten­gah Lodge who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 had been work­ing.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the BCA told The Straits Times last night: “A stop work or­der is is­sued to the builder to rec­tify any short­com­ings in safe man­age­ment mea­sures on site or in­tro­duce new mea­sures to curb the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>The 13 are part of 20 con­struc­tion projects that were is­sued a safety time out no­tice on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The no­tice al­lows for the dis­in­fec­tion of af­fected ar­eas and a re­view of on­site safe man­age­ment mea­sures, which typ­i­cally takes up to three days.</p>
    <p>The 20 con­struc­tion sites con­sist mainly of com­mer­cial and in­fra­struc­ture projects, said the BCA spokesman.</p>
    <p>Sungei Ten­gah Lodge, Sin­ga­pore’s largest for­eign worker dor­mi­tory with 16,000 res­i­dents, was an­nounced to be a new clus­ter last Satur­day, af­ter two new coro­n­avirus cases were linked to the 55 pre­vi­ous ones there.</p>
    <p>It was the first of two new dor­mi­tory clus­ters in the al­most two weeks since all for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries were de­clared to be clear of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, a dor­mi­tory in Kaki Bukit was also an­nounced as a clus­ter when a fresh Covid-19 case was linked to four pre­vi­ously con­firmed cases at Homes­tay Lodge.</p>
    <p>On Aug 11, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) de­clared all dor­mi­to­ries to be clear of Covid-19, save for 17 stand­alone blocks which had served as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties. Around a week later on Aug 19, the min­istry re­ported that the blocks used for quar­an­tine were cleared of Covid-19 as well.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment on Sun­day night, the Min­istry of Health, MOM and BCA said: “The new cases de­tected in the cleared dor­mi­to­ries demon­strate the im­por­tance of on­go­ing sur­veil­lance and test­ing un­der ros­tered rou­tine test­ing, as well as the need to re­main vig­i­lant and ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries are re­quired to be swabbed for Covid-19 every 14 days.</p>
    <p>In the light of the resur­gence of Covid-19 cases in pre­vi­ously cleared dor­mi­to­ries, health econ­o­mist Phua Kai Hong asked about the ef­fi­cacy of the test­ing pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>Dr Phua, who is ad­junct se­nior re­search fel­low with the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy, said: “This re­flects on the trade-offs be­tween the risks of in­fec­tion con­trol ver­sus the ap­proval to work by for­eign work­ers. We have to screen with greater ac­cu­racy and pub­lic safety first be­fore declar­ing the work­ers as fit to work, with dif­fer­ent lev­els of cer­tainty.”</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin noted that the re­cov­ery of the con­struc­tion sec­tor will be “slug­gish and choppy”.</p>
    <p>“Projects may see starts and stops, as one Covid-19 case could trig­ger a quar­an­tine for the whole dorm. Pri­ori­tis­ing pub­lic health is im­por­tant but will in­evitably sac­ri­fice some labour pro­duc­tiv­ity and growth,” he said.</p>
