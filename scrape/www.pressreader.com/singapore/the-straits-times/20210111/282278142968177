    <p>Some an­tibi­otics are no l onger pack­ing a punch in get­ting rid of cer­tain strains of bac­te­ria, and global health au­thor­i­ties are con­cerned.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has warned that glob­ally, peo­ple are headed to­wards a post-an­tibi­otic era, if ac­tion is not taken to com­bat the is­sue of an­tibi­otic re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>But one sci­en­tist is look­ing to pre­vent this by de­sign­ing the “next gen­er­a­tion of an­tibi­otics”.</p>
    <p>“The in­creas­ing ap­pear­ance of multi-drug-re­sis­tant strains of bac­te­ria, to­gether with the neg­li­gi­ble num­ber of new an­tibi­otic drugs that are presently un­der­go­ing de­vel­op­ment, is be­com­ing a colos­sal health threat,” Is­raeli sci­en­tist Ada Yonath, 81, told The Straits Times in an e-mail in­ter­view last week.</p>
    <p>She added: “It seems that we will soon re­vert to the pre-an­tibi­otic era, dur­ing which diseases caused by par­a­sites or by sim­ple or se­vere in­fec­tions such as pneu­mo­nia or wounds were al­most un­treat­able and re­sulted in fre­quent deaths.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Yonath won a No­bel Prize in chem­istry in 2009 for her work in study­ing the struc­ture and func­tions of the ri­bo­some – be­com­ing the first woman in 45 years to win this cov­eted prize.</p>
    <p>She will be speak­ing vir­tu­ally to young re­searchers about her re­search dur­ing the Global Young Sci­en­tists Sum­mit this week. This will be held in Sin­ga­pore vir­tu­ally this year.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion, the sum­mit gives young re­searchers world­wide a chance to in­ter­act with em­i­nent sci­en­tists and tech­nol­ogy lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Prof Yonath, the di­rec­tor of the He­len and Mil­ton A. Kim­mel­man Cen­tre for Biomolec­u­lar Struc­ture and Assem­bly at the Weiz­mann In­sti­tute of Sci­ence, said her team’s strat­egy for fight­ing an­tibi­otic re­sis­tance is to de­sign the next gen­er­a­tion of an­tibi­otics – by zoom­ing into ri­bo­so­mal struc­tures in bac­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The ri­bo­some is a pro­tein-mak­ing ma­chine in al­most all liv­ing cells that strings to­gether mol­e­cules called amino acids to form long chains that will even­tu­ally be­come pro­teins.</p>
    <p>Pro­teins in turn carry out many func­tions that are es­sen­tial for life.</p>
    <p>Many an­tibi­otics com­bat bac­te­rial in­fec­tions by pre­vent­ing bac­te­rial ri­bo­somes from work­ing.</p>
    <p>But most an­tibi­otics tar­get ri­bo­somes in a broad range of bac­te­ria, which act on non-tar­get bac­te­ria along with the tar­geted bac­te­ria, and can lead to more an­tibi­otic-re­sis­tant bac­te­ria strains.</p>
    <p>Broad-range an­tibi­otics can also cause dis­rup­tion to na­tive bac­te­ria in the body – akin to throw­ing the baby out with the bath­wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Prof Yonath said such an­tibi­otics rely on “tra­di­tional an­tibi­otic bind­ing sites” on bac­te­rial ri­bo­somes.</p>
    <p>So to de­velop the next-gen­er­a­tion an­tibi­otics, it was key to map out the struc­ture of ri­bo­somes of disease-caus­ing bac­te­ria in or­der to iden­tify new po­ten­tial ar­eas for an­tibi­otics to tar­get.</p>
    <p>This leads to the next step of de­sign­ing com­pounds that match these tar­gets, “thus block­ing their func­tion and even­tu­ally killing the pathogen”, said Prof Yonath.</p>
    <p>These an­tibi­otics tar­get­ing ri­bo­somes spe­cific to disease-caus­ing bac­te­ria species are called nar­row-spec­trum an­tibi­otics.</p>
    <p>Prof Yonath had made about 25,000 at­tempts to crys­tallise bac­te­rial ri­bo­somes to study their struc­ture be­fore she and her team at the Weiz­mann In­sti­tute of Sci­ence in Is­rael fi­nally suc­ceeded in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional sci­en­tific com­mu­nity had tried and failed many times to crys­tallise ri­bo­somes in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>For her at­tempts, Prof Yonath has been called “the world’s dreamer”. This, she says, is driven by an in­quir­ing mind she has de­vel­oped since her child­hood.</p>
    <p>“I was al­ways very cu­ri­ous,” she said, cit­ing how she tried to mea­sure the height of her bal­cony when she was five.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to reach the ceil­ing, I put a chair on the ta­ble. Then I fell to the ground floor and broke my arm,” she shared.</p>
    <p>This cu­rios­ity, and pas­sion for sci­ence, is some­thing she hopes young sci­en­tists will learn.</p>
    <p>She added: “My ad­vice is: Don’t look for ad­vice. Go after your cu­rios­ity.”</p>
