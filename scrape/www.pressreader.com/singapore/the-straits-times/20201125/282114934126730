    <p>There will be no Chi­nese New Year bazaar in Chi­na­town next year due to the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to do with­out the bazaar for the first time in its his­tory came as a re­sult of con­cerns over crowd con­trol, said the or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>The Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Cit­i­zens’ Con­sul­ta­tive Com­mit­tee also told Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao that the or­gan­is­ers had con­sid­ered other so­lu­tions but faced un­cer­tain­ties over when phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing will be­gin.</p>
    <p>Shop own­ers i n Chi­na­town, some of whom have been sell­ing their wares for more than 15 years, were dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>Ms Jane Yee, who owns a dec­o­ra­tion shop near Chi­na­town MRT sta­tion, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that she was “quite up­set” when she heard the news.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old has no plans to sell her lanterns on the In­ter­net, con­sid­er­ing the stiff com­pe­ti­tion from whole­salers on­line.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Yee: “We’re old al­ready... we don’t know how to sell things on­line.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers said the can­cel­la­tion of the Chi­nese New Year bazaar comes af­ter a dif­fi­cult year for their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Another seller of Chi­nese New Year dec­o­ra­tions, a 49-year-old who gave her name only as Ms Huang, said that she had ex­pe­ri­enced a “sig­nif­i­cant” loss of cus</p>
    <p>tomers this year.</p>
    <p>This led her to or­der only half the stock she had brought in dur­ing the Chi­nese New Year pe­riod this year.</p>
    <p>A shop owner, who wanted to be known only as Madam Neo, said the vol­ume of goods she had or­dered in an­tic­i­pa­tion of Chi­nese New Year was the low­est in two decades.</p>
    <p>“I don’t an­tic­i­pate crowds the size of pre­vi­ous years at all,” said the 60-year-old, who runs a qi­pao shop.</p>
    <p>Since 1989, shop­pers have thronged the bazaar to buy Chi­nese New Year good­ies, spring cou­plets and tra­di­tional Chi­nese at­tire.</p>
    <p>The bazaar, which usu­ally runs for three weeks, has been held</p>
    <p>around Pagoda, Smith, Tem­ple and Treng­ganu streets.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary this year, 329 stalls took part in the bazaar, which has seen some 900,000 vis­i­tors in good years.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomer Tan Hoon, 65, will miss the mar­ket, which she says is the “main point of Chi­na­town dur­ing Chi­nese New Year”.</p>
    <p>“The at­mos­phere will def­i­nitely</p>
    <p>be dif­fer­ent... You re­ally need to soak in the fes­tive spirit at the mar­ket to feel like it’s Chi­nese New Year,” said Ms Tan, who works at a travel agency.</p>
    <p>ST has con­tacted the Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Cit­i­zens’ Con­sul­ta­tive Com­mit­tee for com­ment.</p>
