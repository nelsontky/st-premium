    <p>The for­mer prin­ci­pal of an ed­u­ca­tion cen­tre who – as­sisted by her then tu­tors – schemed to help six stu­dents cheat in their pa­pers dur­ing the 2016 O-level ex­am­i­na­tions was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to four years’ jail.</p>
    <p>The prin­ci­pal of the now de­funct Zeus Ed­u­ca­tion Cen­tre, Poh Yuan Nie, 54, and two for­mer tu­tors – her niece Fiona Poh Min, 33, and Feng Ri­wen, 28 – were each found guilty of 27 counts of cheat­ing on July 7.</p>
    <p>District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt had con­victed the trio fol­low­ing a trial. They com­mit­ted the of­fences on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions in Oc­to­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Fiona Poh was sen­tenced to three years’ jail while Feng was sen­tenced to two years and four months in jail.</p>
    <p>A fourth of­fender, for­mer tu­tor Tan Jia Yan, 34, was sen­tenced to three years’ jail last year over her role in the ruse.</p>
    <p>Tan, who used to work at the ed­u­ca­tion cen­tre in Tampines Street 34, had pleaded guilty in April 2018 to 27 cheat­ing charges. The three women are Sin­ga­pore­ans while Feng is a Chi­nese na­tional.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors had ear­lier stated in their sub­mis­sions that Poh Yuan Nie, also known as Pony, was paid $8,000 per stu­dent by Mr Dong Xin, a Chi­nese na­tional, to pro­vide tu­ition to the stu­dents to help them pass the ex­ams and en­ter lo­cal poly­tech­nics.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors (DPPs) Vadi­vala­gan Shan­muga and Cheng Yuxi had told the court that Poh mas­ter­minded the scheme while her ac­com­plices would “not do any­thing with­out go­ing through her”.</p>
    <p>A few hours before each exam, Fiona Poh, Tan and Feng helped to tape com­mu­ni­ca­tion de­vices on the stu­dents. The stu­dents then sat the ex­ams with these de­vices taped to their bod­ies and care­fully con­cealed by their clothes.</p>
    <p>Tan also sat the ex­ams as a pri­vate can­di­date and used the FaceTime ap­pli­ca­tion on her phone to present a live stream of the ques­tion pa­pers to the co-ac­cused sta­tioned at the tu­ition cen­tre. Her ac­com­plices then worked on the ques­tions streamed to them. After that, Feng and the oth­ers called the stu­dents to read the an­swers to them.</p>
    <p>The DPPs had stated that this crim­i­nal set-up suc­ceeded for three pa­pers from Oct 19 to 21, 2016. But it got ex­posed on Oct 24 when an alert in­vig­i­la­tor heard “un­usual elec­tronic trans­mis­sions and voices” com­ing from one of the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>After the exam, the stu­dent was taken to an of­fice where he handed over de­vices in­clud­ing Blue­tooth re­ceivers and an ear­piece. He also came clean on how the ruse was car­ried out.</p>
