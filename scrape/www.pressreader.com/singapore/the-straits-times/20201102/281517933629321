    <p>Help is at hand for small firms in fi­nan­cial dis­tress due to Covid-19. One scheme will as­sist part­ner­ships or sole pro­pri­etors to re­struc­ture their un­se­cured debt. An­other will help small and medium-sized en­ter­prises work out their credit fa­cil­i­ties across mul­ti­ple banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies all at once.</p>
    <p>Small firms in fi­nan­cial dis­tress due to Covid-19 will re­ceive help from two new schemes launched yes­ter­day – as con­cerns grow that com­pa­nies in badly hit in­dus­tries may be plunged into bank­ruptcy once ear­lier sup­port mea­sures ta­per off.</p>
    <p>One ini­tia­tive will as­sist sole pro­pri­etors or part­ner­ships to re­struc­ture un­se­cured debt such as credit card bills or loans se­cured with­out col­lat­eral. An­other will help small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), which em­ploy 65 per cent of work­ers, work out their credit fa­cil­i­ties across mul­ti­ple banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies all at once.</p>
    <p>The schemes were launched by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore (ABS).</p>
    <p>The Law Min­istry had in­tro­duced sev­eral mea­sures to al­le­vi­ate the im­pact of the cri­sis on busi­nesses, in­clud­ing a mora­to­rium on le­gal ac­tion over rents and con­tracts and rais­ing thresh­olds for bank­ruptcy and in­sol­vency pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>The Sole Pro­pri­etors and Part­ner­ships scheme from the ABS aims to com­ple­ment this by fo­cus­ing on busi­nesses that are strug­gling to ser­vice loan com­mit­ments but are likely to re­cover given time and re­vised re­pay­ment terms. It was de­vel­oped with the sup­port of sev­eral ABS mem­ber banks, the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The scheme will al­low busi­nesses to work with Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion, to help re­struc­ture un­se­cured debt owed to 17 par­tic­i­pat­ing lenders, in­clud­ing all the main banks here. Firms can work towards se­cur­ing lower monthly in­stal­ment pay­ments for un­se­cured bor­row­ings by ex­tend­ing the loan re­pay­ment pe­riod up to a max­i­mum of eight years.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est rates for the re­struc­tured debt will be based on the loan’s orig­i­nal con­trac­tual terms, sub­ject to a max­i­mum of 7 per cent a year. A firm can qual­ify if its to­tal un­se­cured debt does not ex­ceed $1 mil­lion and it owes un­se­cured debt to two or more of the par­tic­i­pat­ing lenders. Ap­proval will be at the sole dis­cre­tion of the lenders.</p>
    <p>The other ABS ini­tia­tive, the Ex­tended Sup­port Scheme – Cus­tomised, is avail­able to SMEs with vi­able busi­nesses. It has been de­vised with the sup­port of the Fi­nance Houses As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore and led by United Over­seas Bank and other ma­jor banks to help re­struc­ture a firm’s credit fa­cil­i­ties across mul­ti­ple banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>ABS direc­tor Ong-Ang Ai Boon said: “The in­tent is to fa­cil­i­tate a more holis­tic re­struc­tur­ing of an SME’s loans com­pared to if the</p>
    <p>SME had to ap­proach its lenders in­di­vid­u­ally.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises vice-pres­i­dent Ang Yuit noted that many SMEs have al­ready looked at bring­ing down costs since the coron­avirus cri­sis hit eight months ago.</p>
    <p>“For those who are look­ing to sol­dier on, the ex­tra help in ac­cess to cap­i­tal is good,” he said, adding that it is the out­stand­ing debts in­curred be­fore Covid-19 that busi­nesses need help with. He noted that the schemes would help com­pa­nies wind down their busi­nesses that may no longer be vi­able.</p>
    <p>Both schemes will be open for ap­pli­ca­tion from to­day.</p>
    <p>This week, Par­lia­ment will de­bate pro­posed changes to the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act, that in­clude a scheme to help dis­tressed firms with an­nual rev­enues from $1 mil­lion to $10 mil­lion re­struc­ture debt or wind up.</p>
