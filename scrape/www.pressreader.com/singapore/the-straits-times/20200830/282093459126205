    <p>Af­ter four years at the helm, Kevin Wong will no longer lead the Sin­ga­pore Dis­abil­ity Sports Coun­cil (SDSC) from next month, as the in­cum­bent pres­i­dent will step down at the as­so­ci­a­tion’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing on Sept 29.</p>
    <p>Wong, who served as chief from 2016 to 2020, has reached his ten­ure limit of four con­sec­u­tive years and the 44-year-old told The Sun­day Times that he is “leav­ing very happy”. “The last four years have been re­ward­ing and I’ve achieved what I set out to do,” he said.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Wong un­veiled a $20 mil­lion plan to de­velop dis­abil­ity sports, propos­ing ini­tia­tives to get more peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties to play sport and be phys­i­cally ac­tive, strengthen skills and ca­pa­bil­i­ties of clubs and part­ners and im­prove part­ner­ships and col­lab­o­ra­tion with mem­bers, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tives would cost about $5 mil­lion an­nu­ally over four years.</p>
    <p>Al­though this am­bi­tious $20 mil­lion goal was not met, Wong does not con­sider it a fail­ure, es­ti­mat­ing that the SDSC had raised about three-quarters of its tar­get each year – an es­ti­mated $3.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t pluck that fig­ure out of thin air, we de­rived it from the plans we wanted to run and the ad­min­is­tra­tive sup­port needed,” he said. “Hav­ing that tar­get and the con­ver­sa­tions it started re­ally got peo­ple talk­ing. There are no re­grets; in set­ting tar­gets we must al­ways aim higher.</p>
    <p>“We de­velop pro­grammes and we only run the pro­grammes if we have cor­re­spond­ing fund­ing. We un­der­stood and worked within our re­sources.”</p>
    <p>He felt that mem­ber en­gage­ment and cor­po­rate re­la­tion­ships im­proved through work­ing with dif­fer­ent or­gan­i­sa­tions and run­ning pro­grammes. The ath­letes also main­tained their level of per­for­mance at sport­ing events.</p>
    <p>At the 2017 Asean Para Games, Sin­ga­pore achieved its best away medal haul when its 90 ath­letes – the coun­try’s big­gest over­seas con­tin­gent for the Games – re­turned from Malaysia with nine gold, 17 sil­ver and 24 bronze medals.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic also hosted sev­eral ma­jor in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions, such as the Boc­cia Open in 2018, the World Para Bowl­ing Tour Se­ries (2018 and 2019) and the World Para Swim­ming World Se­ries (2019). These events, said Wong, con­trib­uted to an “ex­cit­ing cal­en­dar” that cre­ated a buzz in the fra­ter­nity.</p>
    <p>Raja Singh, who was a com­mit­tee mem­ber dur­ing Wong’s term, praised the lat­ter for his ef­forts to en­cour­age in­clu­sive­ness.</p>
    <p>The 58-year-old added: “He did</p>
    <p>WELL DONE</p>
    <p>He did pretty well as pres­i­dent (in terms of) gov­er­nance. For high per­for­mance, there were a lot of col­lab­o­ra­tions with Sport Sin­ga­pore so our ath­letes could ben­e­fit from them. He did a pretty good job and worked very hard dur­ing his term.</p>

    <p>As Wong pre­pares to hand over the helm to the newly elected SDSC pres­i­dent next month, he called on stake­hold­ers and the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties to con­tinue hav­ing dis­cus­sions and col­lab­o­ra­tions on in­clu­siv­ity, and a “con­crete plan” on the role of dis­abil­ity sport in the lo­cal sport­ing ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>“There should only be one sports coun­cil and one na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion, hav­ing two al­ready tells you there’s a dif­fer­ence,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It’s eas­ier said than done but that’s how I feel sport in Sin­ga­pore should be – as a na­tional body you look af­ter every­body, whether they are young, old, dis­abled or able-bod­ied.”</p>
