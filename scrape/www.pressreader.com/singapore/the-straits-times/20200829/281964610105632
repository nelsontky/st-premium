    <p>• Hur­ri­cane Laura tore through Louisiana on Thurs­day, killing six peo­ple and flat­ten­ing build­ings across a wide swathe of the state be­fore mov­ing into Arkansas with heavy rain.</p>
    <p>Laura’s pow­er­ful gusts up­rooted trees and four peo­ple were crushed to death in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents of trees fall­ing on their homes. The state’s depart­ment of health said late on Thurs­day that there were two more fa­tal­i­ties at­trib­uted to the hur­ri­cane – a man who drowned while aboard a sink­ing boat and a man who had car­bon monox­ide poi­son­ing caused by a gen­er­a­tor in his home.</p>
    <p>In West­lake, a chem­i­cal plant caught fire when hit by Laura, and the flames con­tin­ued to send a chlo­rine-in­fused plume of smoke sky­ward nearly 24 hours af­ter the hur­ri­cane made land­fall.</p>
    <p>Laura caused less may­hem than pre­dicted – but of­fi­cials said it re­mained a dan­ger­ous storm and that it would take days to as­sess the dam­age. At least 867,000 homes and busi­nesses in Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas re­mained with­out power on Thurs­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>“This was the most pow­er­ful storm to ever make land­fall in Louisiana,” Gov­er­nor John Bel Ed­wards told a news con­fer­ence. “It’s con­tin­u­ing to cause dam­age and lifethreat­en­ing con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>The storm passed through Lake Charles, with a pop­u­la­tion of 78,000, in the hour af­ter land­fall.</p>
    <p>Laura’s max­i­mum sus­tained winds of 241kmh upon land­fall eas­ily bested Ka­t­rina, which sparked deadly levee breaches in New Or­leans in 2005, and ar­rived with wind speeds of 201kmh.</p>
    <p>Laura’s eye crossed into south­ern Arkansas late on Thurs­day af­ter­noon and was headed to the north-east. The storm could dump 178mm of rain on por­tions of Arkansas, likely caus­ing flash floods.</p>
    <p>Laura was down­graded to a trop­i­cal de­pres­sion by the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre at 10pm, and the fore­caster said it would move to the mid-Mis­sis­sippi Val­ley later yes­ter­day and then to the mid-At­lantic states today.</p>
    <p>Laura’s howl­ing winds lev­elled build­ings and a 4.6m-high wall of wa­ter crashed into tiny Cameron, Louisiana, where the hur­ri­cane made land­fall around 1am.</p>
    <p>A 6m storm surge that had been forecast to move 64km in­land was avoided when Laura tacked east just be­fore land­fall, Mr Ed­wards said. That meant a mighty gush of wa­ter was not fully pushed up the Cal­casieu Ship Chan­nel, which would have given the storm surge an easy path far in­land.</p>
    <p>Trop­i­cal-force winds were felt in nearly every par­ish across Louisiana – and Mr Ed­wards warned that the death toll could climb amid in­creased search and res­cue mis­sions. There were downed power lines around Lake Charles and Na­tional Guard troops cleared de­bris from roads on Thurs­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>The win­dows of the city’s 22-storey Cap­i­tal One Tower were blown out, and pieces of wooden fence and de­bris from col­lapsed build­ings lay scat­tered in the flooded streets, videos on Twit­ter and Snapchat showed.</p>
