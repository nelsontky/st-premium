    <p>Every year around Au­gust, the hor­ti­cul­tural team at Gar­dens by the Bay goes on an is­land­wide hunt for an elu­sive flower to add to its yearly or­chid dis­play: the Vanda Miss Joaquim.</p>
    <p>The hy­brid or­chid is Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional flower, but be­cause its peak flow­er­ing pe­ri­ods oc­cur in May and Septem­ber, it has al­ways been a chal­lenge to gather enough blooms close to the city state’s Na­tional Day, which falls on Aug 9.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, only a hand­ful of sprays of the Vanda Miss Joaquim have ap­peared at the Flower Dome’s an­nual or­chid dis­play from July to Au­gust.</p>
    <p>And its scarcity amid the sprawl­ing dis­play of dif­fer­ent or­chid species – in­clud­ing hy­brid ones – inside the cli­mate-con­trolled dome at the heart of Gar­dens by the Bay has been no­ticed.</p>
    <p>“Every year, some­one would come up to us and ask, Where is the Miss Joaquim?’” said Ms An­drea Kee, deputy direc­tor of the re­search and hor­ti­cul­ture depart­ment at Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the hor­ti­cul­ture team had no­ticed that it was al­ways dif­fi­cult to ob­tain the na­tional flower in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Ms Kee said that one year, the team hunted for it in nurs­eries across the whole of Sin­ga­pore and found only one spray of the flower. “It was re­ally pa­thetic,” she said. To re­solve the peren­nial sup­ply prob­lem, the team sought the ex­per­tise of lo­cal hor­ti­cul­tur­ists and or­chid hob­by­ists and tried var­i­ous meth­ods to de­lay the flow­er­ing pe­riod – such as chang­ing the types of fer­tilis­ers used and in­creas­ing day­light ex­po­sure. But not one of them was ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“We thought it might trick the plant into think­ing that it’s time to flower, so we ex­tended the day­light hours. But it didn’t work,” said Ms Kee.</p>
    <p>It was af­ter study­ing more than 200 plants over a few months that the team found a so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>They dis­cov­ered that as the num­ber of nodes on the plant – or points on the stem from which buds, leaves and branches spring – in­creases, the like­li­hood of flow­er­ing within a week or two also rises.</p>
    <p>For plants that have 42 or more nodes, the prob­a­bil­ity is about 96 per cent, said Dr Shawn Tay, se­nior re­searcher at the re­search and hor­ti­cul­ture depart­ment.</p>
    <p>“When the plant has 42 nodes or more, it is at a stage where it’s ma­ture enough and ready to go into the re­pro­duc­tive stage and flower,” he said.</p>
    <p>“With that knowl­edge, all you need to do is to con­trol the num­ber of nodes in or­der to time the blooms.”</p>
    <p>When­ever a bud forms on the plant, the team would re­move it pre­ma­turely, and an­other one would then ap­pear about two weeks later, said Dr Tay, adding that the team car­ried out this process be­tween Fe­bru­ary and April this year.</p>
    <p>“All you need to do is to have plants that have at least 42 nodes, and de-bud them. Then you can get them to flower at the same time.”</p>
    <p>The first batch of Vanda Miss Joaquim blooms grown us­ing this tech­nique is now show­cased at the Flower Dome in the Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 100 more pots with a few Vanda Miss Joaquim plants each are be­ing cul­ti­vated in the same way at the Gar­dens’ nurs­ery, in prepa­ra­tion for next year.</p>
    <p>The team ex­pects to have at least 80 pots ready for next year’s or­chid dis­play.</p>
    <p>Ms Kee said: “Be­ing the na­tional flower, it’s a source of pride.</p>
    <p>“And Gar­dens by the Bay rep­re­sents a peo­ple’s gar­den. So this is where we think we should dis­play the Vanda Miss Joaquim.”</p>
    <p>NUM­BERS GAME</p>
    <p>When the plant has 42 nodes or more, it is at a stage where it’s ma­ture enough and ready to go into the re­pro­duc­tive stage and flower... All you need to do is to have plants that have at least 42 nodes, and de-bud them. Then you can get them to flower at the same time.</p>
    <p>DR SHAWN TAY, se­nior re­searcher at the re­search and hor­ti­cul­ture depart­ment at Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
