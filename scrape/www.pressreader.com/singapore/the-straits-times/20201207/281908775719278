    <p>It is not just the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore that must do more to pro­vide a safe en­vi­ron­ment for stu­dents (NUS must do more to pro­vide safe en­vi­ron­ment for stu­dents, Dec 4), but also ev­ery school in Sin­ga­pore, from pre-schools and ju­nior col­leges to the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion and poly­tech­nics.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, there have been dis­turb­ing sto­ries of ed­u­ca­tors sex­u­ally ha­rass­ing or as­sault­ing stu­dents (Ex-prin­ci­pal pleads guilty to mo­lest­ing three boys at his school, Aug 29; Ex-teacher ad­mits per­form­ing in­de­cent acts on 2 girls aged 15, Nov 25; and Pri­mary school V-P who sex­u­ally ex­ploited boy gets 10 years’ jail, Oct 17, 2019).</p>
    <p>It can take years for vic­tims of sex­ual ha­rass­ment or as­sault to re­cover and move on with their lives. Some may not be able to move on.</p>
    <p>Can we do more to pro­tect our young? By the time the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) steps in to take dis­ci­plinary ac­tion, se­ri­ous harm would have al­ready been in­flicted on the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Can we adopt more proac­tive prac­tices?</p>
    <p>I be­lieve one of the rea­sons why our stu­dents fall vic­tim to sex­ual of­fences com­mit­ted by ed­u­ca­tors is the no­tion that ed­u­ca­tors are sup­posed to be help­ing stu­dents in their ed­u­ca­tion jour­ney, and are seen as trust­wor­thy.</p>
    <p>If MOE finds it chal­leng­ing to sieve out high-risk ed­u­ca­tors dur­ing the hir­ing process, then we should adopt the ap­proach of teach­ing stu­dents to pro­tect them­selves.</p>
    <p>Teach stu­dents the ar­eas of their bod­ies that should not be touched by any­one, in­clud­ing peo­ple in po­si­tions of author­ity such as prin­ci­pals.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­cate stu­dents that they should not agree to meet any ed­u­ca­tor alone, even in a school en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In­cul­cate courage in our stu­dents. Teach them to voice out and to fight back when they iden­tify im­mi­nent dan­ger. This knowl­edge will also be help­ful when they be­come adults and en­ter the work­force.</p>
    <p>Teach stu­dents the ar­eas of their bod­ies that should not be touched by any­one, in­clud­ing peo­ple in po­si­tions of author­ity such as prin­ci­pals. Ed­u­cate stu­dents that they should not agree to meet any ed­u­ca­tor alone, even in a school en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
