    <p>For six years, Rus­sian-backed sep­a­ratists and Ukrainian forces have been fight­ing each other in the Don­bass re­gion in east­ern Ukraine. Dozens of cease­fires have been agreed, only to be vi­o­lated soon af­ter­wards. This time, how­ever, the armistice – at over a month now – seems to have held. The Straits Times’ global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent</p>
    <p>re­ports from the front line.</p>
    <p>DON­BASS (Ukraine) • Olexi Hodzenko did not go to war for the sake of ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>It is not be­cause he would oth­er­wise not know what to do with his life. He signed up with the Ukrainian army be­cause of un­fin­ished business, which took his fa­ther, Dmytro.</p>
    <p>Dmytro, whose face is tat­tooed on Mr Hodzenko’s right up­per arm, died at the age of 49, on a Thurs­day in March 2016, not far from the place we are now – a trench near a dugout of the 503rd bat­tal­ion at the so-called zero line just across the city of Hor­livka.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the zero line is en­emy ter­ri­tory, an area con­trolled by the sep­a­ratists.</p>
    <p>More than 13,000 Ukraini­ans, Rus­sians, mer­ce­nar­ies and civil­ians have died so far in a war that be­gan six years ago, in the spring of 2014. With a front line stretch­ing nearly 500km, both sides con­tinue to fight trench war­fare only oc­ca­sion­ally punc­tu­ated by a pe­riod of cease­fire, like right now.</p>
    <p>It is a war in Europe that hardly makes a head­line, al­though peo­ple are dy­ing on an al­most daily ba­sis. Even though the cease­fire went into ef­fect on July 27, sep­a­ratists last week killed a Ukrainian sol­dier and wounded an­other in a grenade at­tack.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, the dead are shot by snipers us­ing pre­ci­sion tech­nol­ogy. At the edge of one of the trenches, an up­right plas­tic head, rid­dled with bul­let holes, serves to draw fire from the en­emy. Some­times, it seems, even high-tech can be fooled by the old tricks.</p>
    <p>Dmytro did not die from a sniper’s shot but from shell­fire. On March 31, 2016, at 6am, the house where he and his com­rades were stay­ing came un­der heavy ar­tillery fire. He was due to be dis­charged from ac­tive ser­vice a day later.</p>
    <p>Mr Hodzenko had vis­ited his fa­ther at the front shortly be­fore, on March 16, in his job as a war re­porter for Ukrainian tele­vi­sion sta­tion Chan­nel 24. The pho­to­graph of the two of them, taken that day, has been the pro­file pic­ture on Mr Hodzenko’s Face­book page ever since.</p>
    <p>In it, Dmytro dis­plays a Kalash­nikov ri­fle over his chest while Mr Hodzenko holds a mi­cro­phone for his TV sta­tion. The fa­ther has his</p>
    <p>arm around his son and they beam with pride.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think about him ev­ery day,” Mr Hodzenko says, with a bit too much bravado. And then, adding al­most de­fi­antly: “Life goes on.”</p>
    <p>He de­nies hav­ing signed a three­year con­tract with the army last year be­cause he still has a per­sonal score to set­tle with the en­emy. The 29-year old says he joined up be­cause he wants to de­fend Ukraine against the Rus­sian-backed, antigov­ern­ment sep­a­ratists.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to es­ti­mates by in­ter­na­tional ob­servers, the sep­a­ratists con­sist of nearly 35,000 sol­diers and mili­ti­a­men, in­clud­ing up to 2,000 Rus­sian of­fi­cers. The com­mand struc­ture of the sep­a­ratists is Rus­sian, just as about half of the armed units are Rus­sian.</p>
    <p>In the two self-pro­claimed peo­ple’s re­publics of LNR and DNR, Lu­gansk and Donetsk, the rou­ble is com­mon cur­rency, peo­ple have Rus­sian pass­ports, stores sell al­most ex­clu­sively Rus­sian goods, and house­holds get ham­mered by Rus­sian pro­pa­ganda.</p>
    <p>So far, Moscow is ready to spend bil­lions each year to keep the re­gion above wa­ter. With ev­ery ad­di­tional year, Kiev loses in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, Mr Hodzenko and his com­rades in the Ukrainian army fight an over­pow­er­ing ad­ver­sary, one that can draw from the full, im­mea­sur­able ar­ray of Rus­sian weaponry, ex­pe­ri­ence and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>True, they have come a long way since the be­gin­ning of the war in Ukraine’s east­ern Don­bass re­gion in the spring of 2014.</p>
    <p>The men and women at the front line seem de­ter­mined, coura­geous,</p>
    <p>pas­sion­ate and mo­ti­vated, and vow to fight for Ro­d­ina Mat, the moth­er­land. But how pro­fes­sional are the Ukrainian forces re­ally to­day?</p>
    <p>When hos­til­i­ties be­gan six years ago in the Don­bass, just a few weeks af­ter the an­nex­a­tion of Crimea by Rus­sia, the Ukrainian army was com­pletely un­pre­pared for a mil­i­tary en­gage­ment of that scale.</p>
    <p>A large num­ber of high-rank­ing of­fi­cers, of­ten still Soviet-trained, sym­pa­thised with the Rus­sians. The com­man­der of the Ukrainian navy, Rear-Ad­mi­ral De­nis Bere­zovsky, had crossed over to the Rus­sian side dur­ing the Crimean cri­sis – and was fol­lowed suit by nu­mer­ous other de­fec­tors.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral staff was in­ter­spersed with Rus­sian spies who re­ported to Moscow pre­cisely what the Ukrainian mil­i­tary was plan­ning and where forces were most vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>There were many vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties. Mr Ihor Tenyukh, the de­fence min­is­ter of Ukraine from Fe­bru­ary to March 2014, ad­mit­ted in a speech to Par­lia­ment that of the 140,000 en­listed sol­diers, only 6,000 were op­er­a­tional.</p>
    <p>Bat­tal­ions ex­isted only on paper, nu­mer­ous Ukrainian sol­diers threw away their weapons and de­serted. Com­mand struc­tures were chaotic, com­mu­ni­ca­tion lines were not tap-proof, and those who were wounded on the bat­tle­field had to pray that they would re­ceive ad­e­quate medical care.</p>
    <p>In Ilo­vaisk, De­balt­seve and Donetsk air­port, the army suf­fered bit­ter de­feats. With­out vol­un­teer units, the Ukrainian army would not even have been able to hold the lines of re­treat.</p>
    <p>Ir­reg­u­lar vol­un­teer bat­tal­ions such as Azov, Right Sec­tor, Ay­dar, Don­bass and Dnipro-1 be­came de­ci­sive in the war, and it did not mat­ter at the time how na­tion­al­is­tic and of­ten rad­i­cally right-wing they were. Kiev needed boots on the ground, and it needs them even to­day.</p>
    <p>With the ex­cep­tion of the ul­tra-na­tion­al­ist Right Sec­tor, th­ese para­mil­i­tary troops are now in­te­grated into the army’s com­mand struc­tures, where they en­joy spe­cial free­doms. In re­turn, they are given the risky as­sign­ments, of­ten de­ployed for dan­ger­ous spe­cial op­er­a­tions be­hind en­emy lines.</p>
    <p>A more fun­da­men­tal prob­lem, how­ever, re­mained Ukraine’s un­re­solved po­lit­i­cal destiny. For years, the coun­try was un­de­cided whether it wanted to move closer to the Euro­pean Union and Nato or, rather, lean east­wards to­wards Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Kiev has strug­gled with this ques­tion since its in­de­pen­dence in 1991, with the stale­mate in part re­spon­si­ble for the ne­glect of the mil­i­tary. In­stead of over­haul­ing the mil­i­tary and part­ing with dis­loyal Moscowobe­di­ent of­fi­cers, the chang­ing gov­ern­ments in Kiev con­cen­trated on the press­ing do­mes­tic is­sues.</p>
    <p>The war was the cat­a­lyst for mod­erni­sa­tion, said ex­perts such as Dr Mar­garete Klein of the Ger­man think-tank SWP, in a 2018 study.</p>
    <p>Since 2014, the num­ber of sol­diers has in­creased to over 200,000. The com­mand struc­ture has been re­or­gan­ised, new weapons tech­nol­ogy, such as drones, has been pur­chased, and young cadres trained by Nato in­struc­tors.</p>
    <p>But is it enough?</p>
    <p>On the ground, say sol­diers, sub­servience pre­vails, open crit­i­cism is un­de­sir­able and, in case of doubt, old-school top-down chains of com­mand are ap­plied.</p>
    <p>“Too many gen­er­als still think Soviet style,” says Mr Leonid Obalzew, 33, who vol­un­teered for the front in 2014 and served for a year as a ma­chine gun­ner. He says he re­turned a changed man.</p>
    <p>Ded­i­cat­ing his life now to vet­er­ans, Mr Obalzew helps trau­ma­tised sol­diers re­turn­ing home from war. The pizza chain he runs em­ploys many vet­er­ans and part of his in­come goes to vet­er­ans’ as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle by lit­tle, a new gen­er­a­tion is tak­ing root that is more self-con­fi­dent, with a more open ap­proach, be­lieves bat­tal­ion com­man­der Vadim Sukharevsk­y. “But it will take time.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sukharevsk­y is com­man­der of the 503rd Bat­tal­ion – and a Ukrainian war hero. In the first days of the war, in April 2014, he opened fire near the vil­lage of Slavyansk to stop an at­tack by the rebels.</p>
    <p>He acted with­out or­ders, on his own ini­tia­tive – and suc­cess­fully beat back the ad­ver­sary. Serv­ing un­der him is an hon­our for the sol­diers – and com­pen­sates for many dis­ap­point­ments of the mea­gre army life.</p>
    <p>Does Mr Sukharevsk­y be­lieve in the cease­fire? The war veteran looks up, takes a deep breath and then diplo­mat­i­cally says: “We are stick­ing to it. But I am not con­vinced. I hope that our politi­cians will not be­tray our in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>The cease­fire is not pop­u­lar with the troops. One sol­dier be­lieves: “The sep­a­ratists will use the time to for­tify their po­si­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Hodzenko says: “They are pre­par­ing for some­thing over there.”</p>
    <p>“As a frozen con­flict, this can go on for decades,” says Pro­fes­sor An­dreas Heine­mann-Gruder, a Ger­man arms ex­pert and pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Bonn. “If Moscow can­not an­nex the Don­bass, then the re­gion should at least re­main a sting in the flesh of Ukraine.”</p>
    <p>This way, Ukraine’s de­sired mem­ber­ship in Nato can be tor­pe­doed as Nato is un­likely to ac­cept a coun­try that is in a state of war with a Rus­sia proxy as a full-fledged mem­ber.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is un­clear how much longer the peo­ple in Don­bass will en­dure the con­flict. In the re­gion con­trolled by the sep­a­ratists, about half of the once six mil­lion peo­ple have al­ready left. Of those who have re­mained, over a mil­lion are pensioners.</p>
    <p>In the Ukrainian part of Don­bass, the sit­u­a­tion is only slightly bet­ter. With the econ­omy weak, de­pres­sion and deso­la­tion are per­cep­ti­ble al­most ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>“We are de­fend­ing them, but at the same time peo­ple have enough of the war,” says Mr Hodzenko, look­ing up from the trenches.</p>
    <p>Still no shot is fired. It is quiet, men­ac­ingly quiet.</p>
