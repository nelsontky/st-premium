    <p>TOKYO • More than 40 crew mem­bers were miss­ing af­ter a ship car­ry­ing cat­tle from New Zealand to China cap­sized in the East China Sea, as Ty­phoon Maysak lashed the area with strong winds and heavy seas, the Ja­panese coast guard said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A lone crew mem­ber from the Gulf Live­stock 1 has been res­cued so far. Three ves­sels, four air­planes and two divers were tak­ing part in the search.</p>
    <p>The ship, which had a cargo of nearly 6,000 cat­tle, sent a dis­tress call from the west of Amami Oshima is­land i n south-western Ja­pan on Wed­nes­day, as Ty­phoon Maysak bar­relled to­wards the Korean penin­sula.</p>
    <p>Mr Sareno Ed­var­odo, a 45-yearold chief of­fi­cer from the Philip­pines, was res­cued on Wed­nes­day night, Ja­pan’s coast­guard said.</p>
    <p>The crew of 43 was made up of 39 peo­ple from the Philip­pines, two from New Zealand, and two from Aus­tralia, the coast guard said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Ed­var­odo, the ship lost an en­gine be­fore it was hit by a wave and cap­sized, a coast guard spokesman said.</p>
    <p>When the ship tipped over, the crew were in­structed to put on life jack­ets. Mr Ed­var­odo told the coast guard he jumped into the wa­ter and did not see any other crew mem­bers be­fore he was res­cued.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pine govern­ment said it was co­or­di­nat­ing with the Ja­panese coast guard in the search.</p>
    <p>Ty­phoon Maysak made land­fall in South Korea yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At least two peo­ple were re­ported killed and thou­sands were tem­po­rar­ily with­out power as Ty­phoon Maysak brought heavy rain and lash­ing winds to ar­eas still re­cov­er­ing from Ty­phoon Bavi.</p>
    <p>The ninth ty­phoon of the sea­son and the fourth to hit the penin­sula this year left about 120,000 house­holds with­out power, of­fi­cials said. Flights were can­celled or de­layed, and downed trees and other de­bris caused light dam­age, Yonhap news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>One per­son died when winds shat­tered a win­dow in South Korea’s sec­ond-largest city of Busan, which bore the brunt of the storm’s 170kmh winds.</p>
    <p>An­other man in the city was found dead, be­lieved to have fallen from the roof of his house while re­pair­ing a leak, Yonhap re­ported.</p>
    <p>The penin­sula typ­i­cally sees only one ty­phoon a year, but an­other ty­phoon, Haishen, is brew­ing south of Ja­pan and is ex­pected to hit the Korean coast next Sun­day or Mon­day, the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion’s Earth Ob­ser­va­tory re­ported.</p>
    <p>Some of the ar­eas hard­est hit yes­ter­day were still count­ing the cost of last week’s Ty­phoon Bavi and one of the wettest mon­soon sea­sons on record.</p>
    <p>North Korea took the brunt of Ty­phoon Bavi, and for a sec­ond week in a row, state TV car­ried rare live re­ports of storm surge and flood­ing, in­clud­ing in the coastal town of Won­san.</p>
