    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Do not worry about the odds. Just keep push­ing to­wards suc­cess. You can over­come al­most any­thing if you main­tain a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You open up men­tally and un­der­stand some­one or some­thing quite a bit more. It is a good day for re­flec­tion and learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Tak­ing ac­tion gets you fur­ther than think­ing, so keep ex­per­i­ment­ing and try­ing new ideas be­fore de­cid­ing if they can work for you.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Try not to worry too much about the way to­day is go­ing. If it is good, then of course you are happy.</p>
    <p>But if it is bad, it is just tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You may be very ex­cited about a re­cent change you have made, but no one else is. Try to keep it to your­self. Time is your ally in this.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is strong and you should find that it is much eas­ier than usual to push for­ward in a di­rec­tion that feels right.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>It is a weird day, so be­ware of things that seem out of place. Things may go awry, but if you see the dis­rup­tion com­ing, you can re­act.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You and a friend are in sync so make the most of it. Good en­ergy makes it eas­ier to com­mu­ni­cate, get tasks done and also to plan ahead.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You are not as en­er­gised as you have been, but do not de­spair.</p>
    <p>You just need to take things more slowly and try not to rock the boat.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You have what it takes to push your­self through the chal­lenges. Your amaz­ing en­ergy is per­fect for long-term projects.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing just a lit­tle too tired to take care of ev­ery­thing. Take a nap, en­list sup­port and see if you can put off some low-pri­or­ity stuff.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your team needs a change and only you know it. Now is the time to share your feel­ings so they can de­cide if they want to fol­low your lead.</p>
