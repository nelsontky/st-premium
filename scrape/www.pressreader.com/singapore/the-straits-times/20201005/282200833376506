    <p>• Cineworld, the world’s sec­ond-big­gest cin­ema op­er­a­tor, is set to close all its screens in the United King­dom and Ire­land as soon as this week, London’s Sun­day Times re­ported last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Re­gal cin­ema owner wrote to Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Cul­ture Min­is­ter Oliver Dow­den over the week­end to say that the in­dus­try has be­come “un­vi­able” be­cause of film stu­dios’ de­ci­sion to post­pone big-bud­get films, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>The new James Bond movie, No Time To Die, be­came the lat­est block­buster to be pushed to next year as the movie in­dus­try strug­gles to get back to business amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Cineworld de­clined to com­ment on the Sun­day Times report.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which started re­open­ing its sites from July, runs a to­tal of 128 the­atres and 1,180 screens in the United King­dom and Ire­land.</p>
    <p>Cineworld is ex­pected to an­nounce its plan, which could put about 5,500 jobs at risk, as soon as to­day, the report said.</p>
    <p>“If gov­ern­ments were to strengthen re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ing, which may there­fore oblige us to close our es­tate again or fur­ther push back movie re­leases, it would have a neg­a­tive im­pact on our fi­nan­cial per­for­mance and likely re­quire the need to raise ad­di­tional liq­uid­ity,” the com­pany said last month.</p>
    <p>The re­lease of Black Widow and West Side Story has also been de­layed un­til next year.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to get au­di­ences back into the­atres have proved dis­ap­point­ing.</p>
    <p>While big­ger chains like AMC En­ter­tain­ment, Cineworld and oth­ers have re­opened many lo­ca­tions, crowds have been thin. Small and mid-sized the­atre com­pa­nies have said they may not sur­vive the im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
