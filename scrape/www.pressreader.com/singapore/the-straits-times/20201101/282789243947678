    <p>Less than a year into his new job at global ship­ping gi­ant Maersk, fleet su­per­in­ten­dent Benny Lim was pre­sented with a ma­jor prob­lem: a ves­sel he was man­ag­ing broke down in South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>It was stuck there for al­most a week and Mr Lim did 12-hour shifts in ro­ta­tion with a col­league to trou­bleshoot with the ship’s cap­tain and its chief en­gi­neer.</p>
    <p>“You know the stakes and how much we’re los­ing with the ship just wait­ing there. If I had been han­dling it alone, I might have re­ally thrown in the towel, but my col­leagues were re­ally sup­port­ive,” said Mr Lim, 33.</p>
    <p>“You learn and you’re able to man­age it the next time.”</p>
    <p>His job in­volves man­ag­ing six con­tainer ves­sels worth mil­lions of dol­lars, en­sur­ing they run safely, re­li­ably and ef­fi­ciently. He over­sees ev­ery­thing from bud­get con­trol to lo­gis­tics – such as mak­ing sure spare parts ar­rive on board in time – to han­dling emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>“At Maersk, I’m re­ally em­pow­ered to make de­ci­sions. For in­stance, if a cap­tain calls at 2am or 3am to ask if he can stop the ship, I can say yes or tell him what to do in­stead of stop­ping,” he said.</p>
    <p>He is en­trusted with this level of re­spon­si­bil­ity as he has years of ex­pe­ri­ence in the mar­itime in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing a diploma in marine engi­neer­ing at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, Mr Lim spent time at sea even as he gained cer­ti­fi­ca­tions, un­til he re­ceived his chief en­gi­neer li­cence.</p>
    <p>He re­turned to work in a shore­based job, join­ing Maersk three years ago where he con­tin­ues to up­grade his skills – com­plet­ing a mas­ter’s de­gree in mar­itime stud­ies this year.</p>
    <p>One of the perks of the job is get­ting to travel, as su­per­in­ten­dents are ex­pected to in­spect the ves­sels they man­age at least once a year. Mr Lim said sail­ing on the ves­sels al­lows him to get to know their con­di­tion and the crews.</p>
    <p>Each ship has more than 20 peo­ple of dif­fer­ent na­tion­al­i­ties, with the cap­tain and chief en­gi­neer re­port­ing to the su­per­in­ten­dent.</p>
    <p>Fleet group man­ager Sau­rabh Khanna, 39, said this is why su­per­in­ten­dents need good lead­er­ship and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills on top of knowl­edge of ship op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Khanna, who also started out as a marine en­gi­neer in Sin­ga­pore, over­sees a team of su­per­in­ten­dents man­ag­ing 54 ships in all.</p>
    <p>“When I started sail­ing, there was no In­ter­net on board... Now, you can log on to Face­book and In­sta­gram on the ship and you can even do video calls,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore­ans have a great ad­van­tage if they want to join the in­dus­try, with many train­ing fa­cil­i­ties and ship­ping com­pa­nies here to gain ex­pe­ri­ence at.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said it is not an easy path, but urged those start­ing out in their ca­reers to per­se­vere and at­tain their chief en­gi­neer li­cence.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the na­tional Skills Frame­work for Sea Trans­port, tech­ni­cal or se­nior tech­ni­cal su­per­in­ten­dents can earn $11,600 to $15,000 a month.</p>
    <p>“Try not to quit, see it through and the prospects are there,” said Mr Lim.</p>
