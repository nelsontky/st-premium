    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den and Ms Ka­mala Har­ris, nom­i­nated as his run­ning mate, will be tested reg­u­larly for Covid-19, an aide has said, as the cam­paign pre­pares for the pos­si­bil­ity of more public events in the run-up to the Novem­ber polls.</p>
    <p>Since the coronaviru­s be­gan spread­ing widely i n the United States in March, Mr Bi­den has ap­peared at few public events, most of them close to his Delaware home.</p>
    <p>But fol­low­ing his for­mal nom­i­na­tion at last week’s Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion, the cam­paign is ex­pand­ing its health pro­to­cols in a new phase of the race that could see the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent in closer prox­im­ity to the public.</p>
    <p>“Con­sis­tent with the trans­parency (Mr) Bi­den has demon­strated, we will make public if ei­ther (he) or Sen­a­tor Har­ris ever has a con­firmed, pos­i­tive case of Covid-19,” a cam­paign aide told Reuters on Monday.</p>
    <p>The aide said Mr Bi­den, 77, and Ms Har­ris, 55, as well as key staff who in­ter­act with them, would be tested “on a reg­u­lar ba­sis”, in line with the ad­vice of med­i­cal ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>“This is what re­spon­si­ble lead­er­ship looks like,” the per­son added.</p>
    <p>Re­porters have fre­quently asked Mr Bi­den whether he has been tested for Covid-19, and he has al­ways an­swered no.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has crit­i­cised Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic, which has killed nearly 180,000 Amer­i­cans, as dis­as­trous.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing cam­paign ap­pear­ances, many broad­cast on­line, Mr Bi­den con­sis­tently wears masks and main­tains dis­tance to show his ad­her­ence to public health guide­lines.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, Mr Trump, 74, who will face Mr Bi­den in the Nov 3 elec­tion, down­played the virus out­break in its early stages. He once re­ferred to mask-wear­ing as po­lit­i­cally cor­rect and has been re­luc­tant to wear a face cov­er­ing him­self.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump in July wore a mask in public for the first time, a shift in his tone to en­cour­age Amer­i­cans to wear them as the coun­try be­gan to see a spike in cases.</p>
