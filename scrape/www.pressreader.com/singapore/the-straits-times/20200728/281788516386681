    <p>SEOUL • North Korea is seiz­ing on the re­turn of a de­fec­tor from the South to point the fin­ger at Seoul for the ar­rival of coro­n­avirus in the coun­try af­ter months of deny­ing it had any cases, an­a­lysts have said.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang im­posed a lock­down on the border city of Kaesong, say­ing it had found a sus­pected Covid-19 in­fec­tion in a de­fec­tor who had re­turned across the heav­ily for­ti­fied Demil­i­tarised Zone that di­vides the penin­sula, state me­dia re­ported at the week­end.</p>
    <p>For months, the North had de­nied hav­ing any cases of the virus that swept the world af­ter first emerg­ing in neigh­bour­ing China – its main di­plo­matic backer and trade part­ner – rais­ing scep­ti­cism among ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Seoul of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day that the man be­lieved to be the re-de­fec­tor has never been con­firmed as a coro­n­avirus pa­tient in the South, nor a con­tact of a con­firmed case.</p>
    <p>The South has car­ried out more than 1.5 mil­lion tests as part of an ex­ten­sive “trace, test and treat” model that has largely brought the out­break un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the North was likely to have al­ready had virus cases, and Py­ongyang was look­ing to blame Seoul for the out­break, rather than its own long­stand­ing ally Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“North Korea may try to use the de­fec­tor’s re­turn to de­flect the blame for an out­break that has al­ready oc­curred, or for any fu­ture quar­an­tine fail­ures,” said former US govern­ment North Korea an­a­lyst Rachel Lee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It could take is­sue with South Korea’s poor front-line se­cu­rity,” she told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“It could even claim that South Korea pur­pose­fully sent the de­fec­tor back to North Korea to spread the virus there.”</p>
    <p>Ms Duyeon Kim, a Korea ex­pert at the In­ter­na­tional Cri­sis Group, added that by blam­ing an im­ported</p>
    <p>North Korea may try to use the de­fec­tor’s re­turn to de­flect the blame for an out­break that has al­ready oc­curred, or for any fu­ture quar­an­tine fail­ures.</p>
    <p>case from the South, the North “can now le­git­i­mately and openly ac­cept” aid from Seoul.</p>
    <p>The North could “fur­ther send a mes­sage about de­fec­tors, paint­ing them as en­e­mies of the state”, she added in a tweet.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang has re­peat­edly ex­co­ri­ated leaflet-send­ing de­fec­tors and the Seoul govern­ment in re­cent weeks, wors­en­ing al­ready frozen in­ter-Korea ties and cul­mi­nat­ing in the North blow­ing up a li­ai­son of­fice on its side of the border.</p>
    <p>It is ex­tremely rare for North Korean de­fec­tors to re­turn to their orig­i­nal coun­try, where rights groups say they face se­vere pun­ish­ment for leav­ing. The South’s Uni­fi­ca­tion Min­istry says only 11 are known to have done so in the past five years.</p>
    <p>It is even rarer for them to travel through the Demil­i­tarised Zone, one of the world’s most se­cure bor­ders, re­plete with mine­fields and guard posts.</p>
    <p>But the South Korean mil­i­tary said a North Korean de­fec­tor was be­lieved to have re­turned to the North from Ganghwa is­land, on the Han river es­tu­ary north-west of Seoul.</p>
    <p>He was not of­fi­cially iden­ti­fied, but ac­cord­ing to mul­ti­ple me­dia re­ports and de­fec­tors, he is a 24-year-old who de­fected in 2017, also by swim­ming across a river.</p>
    <p>He is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated on rape al­le­ga­tions in the South, they added.</p>
    <p>The North’s med­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture is seen as woe­fully in­ad­e­quate to deal with any epi­demic, and Py­ongyang closed its bor­ders in late Jan­uary – the first coun­try in the world to do so – in an ef­fort to pro­tect it­self against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
