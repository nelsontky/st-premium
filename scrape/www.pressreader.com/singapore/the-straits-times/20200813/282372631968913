    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • As play­ers adapt to empty sta­di­ums dur­ing this coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Ser­ena Wil­liams be­lieves that si­lence has, in fact, suited her game.</p>
    <p>The 23-time Grand Slam cham­pion re­turned to ac­tion for the first time since the Covid-19 out­break up­ended the ten­nis cal­en­dar, de­feat­ing Bernarda Pera on Tues­day to set up a sec­ond-round clash with sis­ter Venus at the Top Seed Open in Lex­ing­ton, Ken­tucky.</p>
    <p>The top seed will face Venus at the out­door hard court tour­na­ment to­day af­ter her un­seeded older sis­ter beat for­mer world No. 1 Vic­to­ria Azarenka 6-3, 6-2 i n her firstround match.</p>
    <p>Ser­ena made a wob­bly start in the first set against fel­low Amer­i­can Pera but quickly found her foot­ing, fir­ing off seven aces and sav­ing 11 of 13 break points to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, later telling re­porters she was pleased with her com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>“It’s good just in gen­eral be­cause I haven’t played.</p>
    <p>“A lot of play­ers have been play­ing – lit­tle things and lit­tle matches and play­ing against other play­ers – but I’ve only been train­ing so this was re­ally good for me,” said the 38-year-old, who be­fore Tues­day had not played a com­pet­i­tive game since a Fed Cup ap­pear­ance in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>She has also com­mit­ted to play­ing in the Aug 31-Sept 13 US Open.</p>
    <p>The Top Seed Open, the first WTA Tour tour­na­ment in the US since the pan­demic halted play, pro­vided a taste of what is to come for the Amer­i­can as she again bids for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam ti­tle in Flush­ing Mead­ows, with empty, silent stands tak­ing the place of roar­ing crowds.</p>
    <p>But she also re­vealed that the se­date sur­round­ings had brought out the best in her.</p>
    <p>“It was a re­ally calm at­mos­phere, it was re­ally chill,” said Ser­ena, who de­voted a lot of her time off to deep­en­ing her faith through bible study.</p>
    <p>“I can’t say I dis­liked it. I didn’t mind it at all. I’ve been through so many things in my ca­reer and this was to­tally dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“I think I won to­day be­cause I was calm for once in my ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“Kind of re­minds me of ju­nior days. Some­thing nos­tal­gic about that. I kind of en­joyed it.</p>
    <p>“But be­ing in New York will be a lit­tle dif­fer­ent be­cause there’s this mas­sive sta­dium.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can teenage phe­nom­e­non Coco Gauff also pro­gressed by beat­ing com­pa­triot Caro­line Dole­hide in straight sets, set­ting up a clash with 22-year-old sec­ond seed Aryna Sa­balenka of Be­larus.</p>
