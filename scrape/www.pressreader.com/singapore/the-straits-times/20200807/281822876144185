    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Red Cross will con­trib­ute an ini­tial sum of $50,000 to­wards the emer­gency re­sponse and med­i­cal sup­port by the Le­banese Red Cross in the dev­as­tat­ing ware­house ex­plo­sion that killed at least 145 and in­jured more than 5,000 in Beirut, the or­gan­i­sa­tion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It said it will mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion and, if needed, in­crease its sup­port for the re­lief ef­forts by its Le­banese coun­ter­part.</p>
    <p>“Our sin­cere and heart­felt con­do­lences to the peo­ple of Le­banon and to the fam­i­lies of those who were in­jured or lost their lives in this tragedy,” Mr Ben­jamin Wil­liam, sec­re­tary-gen­eral and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“These are very dif­fi­cult and chal­leng­ing times as the world con­tin­ues to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. The blasts have af­fected thou­sands and dis­rupted the pro­vi­sion of crit­i­cal ser­vices, such as med­i­cal ser­vices, made all the more ur­gent due to the pandemic.”</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sion has piled tremen­dous pres­sure on Le­banon’s al­ready strug­gling health­care fa­cil­i­ties, Agence France-Presse re­ported, adding that the coun­try’s in­ten­sive care wards were al­ready near ca­pac­ity be­cause of a re­cent spike in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>None was pre­pared for the in­flux of thou­sands of wounded pa­tients overnight.</p>
    <p>The Le­banese Red Cross, which has been the main provider of am­bu­lances in Beirut with more than 300 am­bu­lances and 3,000 emer­gency tech­ni­cians on its staff, has ap­pealed on its web­site for funds and blood do­na­tions to help in the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“It is crit­i­cal that we all come to­gether to ex­tend what­ever sup­port we can to en­hance the re­lief op­er­a­tions,” Mr Wil­liam said.</p>
