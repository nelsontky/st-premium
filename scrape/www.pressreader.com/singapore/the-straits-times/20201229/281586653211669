    <p>A ca­pac­ity curb on ve­hi­cles fer­ry­ing work­ers has been lifted.</p>
    <p>The move to do away with the 25 per cent re­duc­tion in car­ry­ing ca­pac­ity is in line with the start of phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They had in late May an­nounced the re­duc­tion in max­i­mum pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity as the coun­try geared up to re­sume busi­ness after the cir­cuit breaker, which ended on June 1.</p>
    <p>Other safe man­age­ment mea­sures will re­main in place. MOM said work­ers should con­tinue to wear a mask at all times in the ve­hi­cle and that they should not talk or in­ter­act while on board.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers must also con­tinue to ar­range pri­vate trans­port for work­ers staying in dor­mi­to­ries to com­mute to and from their work­places. These ve­hi­cles must not be car­ry­ing any other pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>“These mea­sures are nec­es­sary to pre­vent cross-in­fec­tions be­tween mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries and the com­mu­nity, in both di­rec­tions,” said MOM.</p>
    <p>“If nec­es­sary, em­ploy­ers should make pro­vi­sions for ad­di­tional trips or ve­hi­cles,” it added.</p>
    <p>The curb has had an im­pact on em­ploy­ers both fi­nan­cially and op­er­a­tionally over the past few months.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ken­neth Loo, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Straits Con­struc­tion: “If you de­crease the ca­pac­ity of each ve­hi­cle by 25 per cent, then the num­ber of ve­hi­cles you re­quire for trans­port must in­crease by at least 25 per cent as well, lead­ing to higher fi­nan­cial costs as well as mak­ing op­er­a­tions more dif­fi­cult as work­ers have to be trans­ported sep­a­rately.”</p>
    <p>While he wel­comed the lift­ing of the curb, he said of phase three: “We can­not let our guard down and we need to be wary.”</p>
    <p>In April, 28 em­ploy­ers were each hit with a $1,000 fine for fail­ing to en­sure com­pli­ance with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures when fer­ry­ing work­ers on their lor­ries.</p>
    <p>In May, a video of a lorry with par­ti­tions in­stalled to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing went vi­ral on­line. The clip was part of a demon­stra­tion video sent as part of a pro­posal to MOM for con­sul­ta­tion. MOM and LTA sub­se­quently said the set-up was un­safe and ad­vised against its use.</p>
    <p>HIGHER COSTS</p>
    <p>If you de­crease the ca­pac­ity of each ve­hi­cle by 25 per cent, then the num­ber of ve­hi­cles you re­quire for trans­port must in­crease by at least 25 per cent as well, lead­ing to higher fi­nan­cial costs as well as mak­ing op­er­a­tions more dif­fi­cult as work­ers have to be trans­ported sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>MR KEN­NETH LOO, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of</p>
    <p>Straits Con­struc­tion, on the im­pact the ca­pac­ity curb on ve­hi­cles fer­ry­ing work­ers has had on em­ploy­ers.</p>
