    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Three top pro­duc­ers on The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003 to present) have ex­ited the pro­gramme after an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion into com­plaints of bul­ly­ing, racism and sex­ual mis­con­duct against them.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Warner Bros Tele­vi­sion, the stu­dio be­hind the syn­di­cated day­time talk show, con­firmed that it had parted ways with three of the show’s pro­duc­ers: Mr Ed Glavin, an ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer; Mr Jonathan Nor­man, a co-ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer; and Mr Kevin Le­man, the head writer.</p>
    <p>The de­par­tures fol­lowed weeks of tur­moil back­stage that has un­der­mined the show’s pub­lic mes­sage of spread­ing kind­ness and hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>Re­ports of a hos­tile work­place have in­cluded crit­i­cism that DeGeneres is mean-spir­ited. She has also come un­der fire for claim­ing ig­no­rance of how her show was run.</p>
    <p>These prompted a so­cial me­dia cam­paign call­ing for her re­place­ment as well as pub­lic state­ments of sup­port for her from celebri­ties such as singer Katy Perry and ac­tors Kevin Hart, Alec Bald­win and Ash­ton Kutcher.</p>
    <p>DeGeneres spoke to the staff of her show via Zoom on Mon­day in what Va­ri­ety said was an emo­tional ad­dress.</p>
    <p>She also apol­o­gised to her staff dur­ing the video con­fer­ence, her sec­ond apol­ogy in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Va­ri­ety cited mul­ti­ple sources as say­ing that DeGeneres told em­ploy­ees she was “not per­fect” and that it was “heart­break­ing” to read al­le­ga­tions about the at­mos­phere on the set.</p>
    <p>The moves came dur­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the show’s work­place, which is still be­ing con­ducted. The re­view was prompted by an in­ves­tiga­tive ar­ti­cle pub­lished last month by Buz­zFeed News de­scrib­ing a “toxic work cul­ture” on the show.</p>
    <p>The former em­ploy­ees who shared their ac­counts laid most of the blame for their bad ex­pe­ri­ences on Mr Glavin and two other top pro­duc­ers, Ms Mary Con­nelly and Mr Andy Lass­ner.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros said on Mon­day that Ms Con­nelly and Mr Lass­ner would re­main in their roles.</p>
    <p>In a sec­ond Buz­zFeed News in­ves­ti­ga­tion, former staff ac­cused Mr Le­man of sex­u­ally ha­rass­ing a num­ber of em­ploy­ees. Mr Le­man has de­nied “any kind of sex­ual im­pro­pri­ety”.</p>
    <p>At 62, DeGeneres is one of the rich­est per­form­ers in tele­vi­sion, as well as a one-woman pow­er­house for Warner Bros Tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to work­ing un­der the stu­dio to make her talk show, she is also a top pro­ducer and star of an­other Warner Bros pro­duc­tion, the NBC prime-time hit, Ellen’s Game Of Games (2017 to present).</p>
    <p>Mr Glavin and Mr Le­man both worked on that show and Warner Bros said on Mon­day they would no longer be a part of it. NBC has re­newed Ellen’s Game Of Games for a fourth sea­son.</p>
