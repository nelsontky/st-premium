    <p>BARCELONA • Ar­turo Vi­dal is on his way out of Barcelona. He is one of three more play­ers, in­clud­ing Luis Suarez and Sa­muel Umtiti, that new coach Ron­ald Koe­man wants to get rid of to make way for new blood.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old made 43 ap­pear­ances in all com­pe­ti­tions last term, scor­ing eight goals. But he has been made a scape­goat fol­low­ing the La Liga club’s first tro­phy­less cam­paign in 12 years and their heav­i­estever Euro­pean de­feat, crushed 8-2 by even­tual win­ners Bay­ern Mu­nich in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sky Sport Italia, Vi­dal is in talks with Barca’s hi­er­ar­chy over an early ter­mi­na­tion of his con­tract, which still has a year to run, while Croa­tia’s Ivan Rakitic was yes­ter­day sold to Sevilla for an ini­tial €1.5 mil­lion (S$2.4 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Serie A out­fit and Europa League fi­nal­ists In­ter Mi­lan are said to be lead­ing the race to land the Chile mid­fielder, who has all but burnt his bridges af­ter his scathing com­ments about how far the Cata­lan gi­ants have fallen.</p>
    <p>In a video in­ter­view pub­lished on YouTube over the week­end, he slammed the club for only “hav­ing 13 pro­fes­sional play­ers and the rest young­sters”.</p>
    <p>On the chaos that has en­sued at the Nou Camp, re­sult­ing in cap­tain Lionel Messi hand­ing in a trans­fer re­quest, the veteran said: “Barcelona have to change their way of think­ing.</p>
    <p>“Foot­ball has moved on a lot and the DNA is be­ing left be­hind be­cause other teams are im­prov­ing in other as­pects.</p>
    <p>“Foot­ball at the mo­ment is more phys­i­cal, more de­pen­dent on power and speed, and the tech­ni­cal side is some­times less im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“In the end, you pay the price when you face an or­gan­ised team, a team that has a win­ning men­tal­ity, with play­ers who pre­pare them­selves phys­i­cally, and who have a strong play­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“That ends up cost­ing you when you’re weak men­tally and in terms of en­ergy. That’s what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>“The last three years are not what a team like Barcelona de­serves. You can­not al­ways win with DNA.”</p>
    <p>Messi’s father and rep­re­sen­ta­tive, Jorge, is ex­pected to meet the Barcelona hi­er­ar­chy, in­clud­ing pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu, to­day to dis­cuss the for­ward’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple me­dia re­ports in­di­cated that the Ar­gentina in­ter­na­tional, the club’s great­est goalscorer (634), is bent on leav­ing the Nou Camp. He wants to ex­er­cise a clause that al­lows him to leave for free but Barca ar­gue the dead­line ex­pired in June.</p>
    <p>How­ever, former vice-pres­i­dent Jordi Mestre be­lieves a com­pro­mise can be reached, telling Span­ish ra­dio sta­tion Cadena SER: “What I can say is that I hope they re­con­sider, sit down and find so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“The exit would have to be very dig­ni­fied and one Leo de­serves. The best player in his­tory does not leave with a buro­fax.”</p>
    <p>The Messi saga is likely to be still hang­ing over the club when the team kicks off the new league sea­son later this month.</p>
    <p>The fixture list was re­leased on Mon­day although Barca, Atletico Madrid, Europa League win­ners Sevilla and cham­pi­ons Real Madrid have been al­lowed to start the term later due to their Euro­pean ex­er­tions – the other teams com­mence next week­end.</p>
    <p>All four sides are ex­pected to play their first game on the week­end of Sept 20, with the first Cla­sico tak­ing place on Oct 25 at Barca be­fore the re­verse fixture on April 11.</p>
    <p>LAG­GING BE­HIND Foot­ball has moved on a lot and the DNA is be­ing left be­hind be­cause other teams are im­prov­ing in other as­pects. Foot­ball at the mo­ment is more phys­i­cal, more de­pen­dent on power and speed, and the tech­ni­cal side is some­times less im­por­tant. ’’ AR­TURO VI­DAL, Barcelona mid­fielder, on how the club need to change their ap­proach to matches.</p>
