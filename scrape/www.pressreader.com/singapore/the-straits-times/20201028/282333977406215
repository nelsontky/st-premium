    <p>LON­DON • Donny van de Beek joined Manch­ester United just two months ago but spec­u­la­tion is al­ready mount­ing over the fu­ture of the £40 mil­lion (S$70.8 mil­lion) man from Ajax.</p>
    <p>The Dutch mid­fielder was the club’s big­gest sign­ing in the trans­fer window, but has yet to fea­ture in the start­ing line-up in ei­ther the Pre­mier League or Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>He failed to get off the bench even as United were try­ing to break the dead­lock in their goal-less draw with Chelsea last week­end, prompt­ing crit­i­cism from Oranje great</p>
    <p>Marco van Bas­ten ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>The for­mer AC Mi­lan striker told Dutch TV that van de Beek had made a mis­take by mov­ing to Old Traf­ford, say­ing: “Donny shouldn’t have gone to United.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally bad for a player like Donny to play six or seven games this year. That’s shock­ing for your rhythm.</p>
    <p>“I know he’s earn­ing loads more than he used to. But, as a top player, you have to be crit­i­cal and look at the chances of play­ing when you sign for a new club. Donny should have waited for bet­ter prospects and signed for another club.”</p>
    <p>Other pun­dits like for­mer United de­fender Pa­trice Evra and Graeme Souness have also weighed in, ques­tion­ing whether the Red Dev­ils ac­tu­ally needed him this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>How­ever, at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence ahead of their Cham­pi­ons League Group H game with last sea­son’s semi-fi­nal­ists, Bun­desliga out­fit RB Leipzig, Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer leapt to the de­fence of van de Beek.</p>
    <p>Claim­ing the 23-year-old needed time to set­tle and in­sist­ing that he would play a “big, big part this year”, the United man­ager said yes­ter­day: “When play­ers come into a new team, a new league, they al­ways need time to adapt.</p>
    <p>“When Donny has played, he’s played re­ally well. It says a lot about our depth of qual­ity in the squad that we don’t have to use him ev­ery game.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice for some play­ers and com­men­ta­tors to have a lit­tle go, but you have to know that you don’t have to start the first three games to be a very im­por­tant player in the squad. He’s go­ing to be im­por­tant, don’t worry about that.”</p>
    <p>United kicked off their Euro­pean cam­paign with an im­pres­sive 2-1 away win against last sea­son’s run­ners-up Paris Saint-Ger­main and Sol­sk­jaer said his team were keen to build on that per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“We look at ev­ery sin­gle game as a chance to get three points,” the Nor­we­gian added. “In the group stage of four teams, you’d think 10 points will get you through. Our aim is to get to 10 points as quick as we can.”</p>
    <p>Leipzig, now play­ing their sec­ond suc­ces­sive sea­son in the Cham­pi­ons League, made a sur­prise run to the last four in Au­gust off the back of a tight de­fence mar­shalled by French in­ter­na­tional Dayot Upame­cano.</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old has been heav­ily linked with United, with the club said to be seek­ing a more re­li­able part­ner for cap­tain Harry Maguire than who they have, and while the trans­fer window has closed, Sol­sk­jaer hinted at a move in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ways ru­mours and spec­u­la­tion about other play­ers and Manch­ester United,” he said. “I don’t want to com­ment on ev­ery player we’re linked to.</p>
    <p>“But since we’re play­ing against him... he’s a very good player and we can see him up close to­mor­row.”</p>
