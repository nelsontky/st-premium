    <p>I have had enough hos­pi­tal food to last at least two life­times and I can­not say that all of it was good. Much of it was jaw-drop­pingly, head-ex­plod­ingly bad.</p>
    <p>So when three hos­pi­tals stick their necks out to say their food is de­li­cious, I roll my eyes and ask to taste it. That they have been able to come up quickly with food for Covid-19 pa­tients works in their favour. But I re­sign my­self to an en­tire day of bland food.</p>
    <p>“Come hun­gry,” says the cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions per­son from one of the hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Yeah, I think. Thanks.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sam­pling the Covid-19 meals at all three hos­pi­tals on the same day, with some dishes that are served to non-Covid-19 pa­tients too, I find my­self eat­ing hum­ble pie.</p>
    <p>I am star­tled by how good the food tastes cold, which is how I eat it, af­ter the in­ter­views and af­ter my col­league Mark has taken pho­to­graphs of ev­ery­thing from ev­ery con­ceiv­able an­gle.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients, of course, are served hot meals.</p>
    <p>ALEXAN­DRA HOS­PI­TAL</p>
    <p>On the day I visit, the pro­tein for meals is chicken patty made with minced chicken stud­ded with carrots, and a veg­e­tar­ian mock meat.</p>
    <p>Th­ese come from sup­pli­ers and are served with green curry and makhani sauces made in-house. The makhani sauce is bright and just rich enough, words not usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with hos­pi­tal food. It is per­fect with the chicken patty which, some­how, is not dried out de­spite be­ing stone cold.</p>
    <p>A good ac­com­pa­ni­ment is the to­mato rice, stud­ded with mus­tard seeds and per­fumed with whole curry leaves. I can eat this any day.</p>
    <p>For dessert, there is a wob­bly jelly (above) made with lemon­grass-in­fused green tea set with just enough gela­tine to hold it to­gether. Al­though sweet­ened with xyl­i­tol, a sugar sub­sti­tute, it does not taste ar­ti­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Lessons for when I cook: Use mus­tard seeds and curry leaves lib­er­ally. They add bags of flavour to ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>KHOO TECK PUAT HOS­PI­TAL</p>
    <p>Where do I be­gin? OK, with tangy rasam, which perks up the ap­petite. The soup works and soon, I am sam­pling the spicy bee­hoon upma. I can tell the salt has been held in check, but the aroma from the spices dis­tracts me from the fact that it is low-salt.</p>
    <p>There is a ter­rific terung be­lado too, the egg­plant chunky, juicy and brightly flavoured.</p>
    <p>Ke­sari, a semolina dessert topped with cashews, pis­ta­chios and raisins, isn’t too sweet and it would have been en­tirely pos­si­ble to eat the whole serv­ing with­out fall­ing into a food coma.</p>
    <p>For Na­tional Day, pas­try chef Ng Cheng Lean had made a red-and-white jelly dessert (above) – milk jelly at the bot­tom, topped with straw­berry jelly on top. De­li­cious. Nei­ther layer is too sweet and the straw­berry layer has real fruit in it.</p>
    <p>Lessons for when I cook: To use less salt with­out mak­ing food bland, use toasted and freshly ground spices, and fresh, perky in­gre­di­ents such as kaffir lime leaves and chill­ies.</p>
    <p>NG TENG FONG GEN­ERAL HOS­PI­TAL</p>
    <p>The minute Mark is done, I zero in on the seafood hor­fun. The noo­dles have a great char and ex­ec­u­tive chef Choo Kok Seng tells me they are fried longer to get more wok hei. In­stead of the usual gluggy gravy, the hos­pi­tal’s ver­sion is not too thick and tastes like it has been made with a good stock. The seafood is not overcooked ei­ther.</p>
    <p>I find my­self go­ing back again and again for the masala chick­peas, so in­tense is the flavour. The dish is per­fect with a bas­mati pi­laf topped with cashews and raisins.</p>
    <p>The west­ern meal (above) that day is spaghetti with a to­mato sauce bright with fresh toma­toes and topped with fra­grant thyme leaves. To go with that, there is a juicy chicken thigh, breaded with flour, egg wash and then ground-up oats.</p>
    <p>I have al­ways be­lieved life is too short to eat chicken breast and am glad pa­tients at the hos­pi­tal get juicy thigh meat.</p>
    <p>Lessons for when I cook: Use ground-up oats in­stead of panko crumbs when coat­ing pro­tein for bak­ing or fry­ing. There’s more fi­bre in oats. I will be sure to eat the food hot, be­cause cold oats have zero al­lure.</p>
