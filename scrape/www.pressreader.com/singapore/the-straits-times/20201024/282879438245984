    <p>LON­DON • An oil paint­ing by Bri­tish street artist Banksy par­o­dy­ing a Claude Monet mas­ter­piece sold in Lon­don on Wed­nes­day for close to £7.6 mil­lion (S$13.5 mil­lion), the se­cond-high­est price at auc­tion for the mys­te­ri­ous artist.</p>
    <p>The oil-on-can­vas work, Show Me The Monet, a mod­ern take on Monet’s im­pres­sion­ist clas­sic The Wa­ter-Lily Pond, sold for £7.55 mil­lion at Sotheby’s fol­low­ing a bid­ding bat­tle.</p>
    <p>“The ham­mer came down af­ter five de­ter­mined col­lec­tors bat­tled for nearly nine min­utes to drive the fi­nal price be­yond its es­ti­mate of £3 mil­lion to £5 mil­lion to be­come the se­cond-high­est price for the artist at auc­tion,” Sotheby’s said.</p>
    <p>The sale comes a year af­ter a Banksy paint­ing de­pict­ing the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment pop­u­lated by chim­panzees smashed the record for the street artist by fetch­ing nearly £9.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>On that oc­ca­sion, the 2009 work ti­tled De­volved Par­lia­ment at­tracted a 13-minute bat­tle among 10 bid­ders.</p>
    <p>Show Me The Monet was cre­ated in 2005, as part of a col­lec­tion called The Crude Oils, and had first been shown pub­licly i n only Banksy’s se­cond gallery ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>The paint­ing trans­forms Monet’s mas­ter­piece, de­pict­ing a Ja­pane­ses­tyle bridge in his fa­mous gar­den at Giverny, into a mod­ern-day fly­tip­ping spot.</p>
    <p>In­stead of an idyl­lic lily pond, the com­po­si­tion shows dis­carded shop­ping trol­leys and a flu­o­res­cent orange traf­fic cone float­ing in the wa­ter be­neath the bridge.</p>
    <p>Banksy has be­come a house­hold name since the turn of the cen­tury, af­ter his iconic graf­fiti paint­ings be­gan to ap­pear overnight on build­ings and at sites around the world.</p>
    <p>The artist’s iden­tity re­mains shrouded in mys­tery even as his works have be­gun to at­tract in­creas­ingly high sums at auc­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a paint­ing by Bri­tish artist David Hock­ney, sold by the Royal Opera House in Lon­don to raise funds to help sur­vive the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, fetched nearly £13 mil­lion at auc­tion on Thurs­day. The paint­ing, which de­picts the iconic Bri­tish in­sti­tu­tion’s for­mer chief David Web­ster, had been es­ti­mated to sell for be­tween £11 mil­lion and £18 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>At an evening auc­tion of post-war and con­tem­po­rary art at Christie’s in Lon­don, the work – Por­trait Of Sir David Web­ster – went un­der the ham­mer for £12.87 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Royal Opera House an­nounced ear­lier this month that it had been forced to sell the paint­ing as it faces “the big­gest cri­sis in our his­tory” due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The pro­ceeds will be used to en­sure that the world’s great­est artists can once more re­turn to our stages,” its chief ex­ec­u­tive Alex Beard said at the time.</p>
