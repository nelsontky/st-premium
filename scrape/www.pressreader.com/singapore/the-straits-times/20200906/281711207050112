    <p>Vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als and peo­ple more likely to be ex­posed to the in­fec­tion will be first in line to re­ceive the Covid-19 vac­cine when one is avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine cov­er­age will also be pro­gres­sively ex­panded to the rest of the pop­u­la­tion, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong in a writ­ten re­ply to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“The vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy and sched­ule would de­pend on sev­eral fac­tors, in­clud­ing the suitabil­ity of dif­fer­ent vac­cines for dif­fer­ent pop­u­la­tion sub-groups and the quan­tity of vac­cines avail­able at any point in time,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to adapt its vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy as more in­for­ma­tion on the var­i­ous vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped be­come avail­able, he added.</p>
    <p>He was re­ply­ing to Mr Ang Wei</p>
    <p>Neng (West Coast GRC) and Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok), both of whom wanted to know more about Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 vac­cine strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said Sin­ga­pore is work­ing on en­sur­ing it has timely ac­cess to an ef­fec­tive and safe vac­cine when it be­comes avail­able, point­ing to the coun­try’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in in­ter­na­tional ini­tia­tives and lo­cal ef­forts to de­velop a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>On the in­ter­na­tional front, the min­is­ter said Sin­ga­pore has on­go­ing dis­cus­sions with mul­ti­ple phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies that are de­vel­op­ing Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>It is work­ing closely with the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), Global Al­liance for Vac­cines and Im­mu­ni­sa­tion, Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions and other coun­tries to es­tab­lish a mul­ti­lat­eral col­lab­o­ra­tion called the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Covax) Fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with multi­na­tional and de­vel­op­ing coun­try vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers, the Covax Fa­cil­ity aims to de­liver by the end of next year two bil­lion doses of safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cines that have passed reg­u­la­tory ap­proval and/or WHO pre-qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said the joint ef­fort will en­able coun­tries to pool risk and re­sources to gain ac­cess to a port­fo­lio of vac­cines from dif­fer­ent vac­cine de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>“En­sur­ing equitable ac­cess to vac­cines will help to bet­ter con­tain and erad­i­cate the Covid-19 pan­demic, not just in Sin­ga­pore but also glob­ally,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment is also sup­port­ing lo­cal ef­forts to de­velop a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School have teamed up with Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics, and the vac­cine they have co-de­vel­oped has been un­der­go­ing early-stage hu­man tri­als since early last month. The tri­als are ad­min­is­tered by the SingHealth In­ves­ti­ga­tional Medicine Unit, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>This co-de­vel­oped vac­cine is one of 34 can­di­dates world­wide that have reached hu­man tri­als. Around 142 oth­ers are at the pre-hu­man trial stage.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is also build­ing up vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity, which can pro­vide fill-and-fin­ish con­tract man­u­fac­tur­ing ser­vices to vac­cine de­vel­op­ers and ramp up pro­duc­tion of vac­cines when they are avail­able,” Mr Gan added.</p>
