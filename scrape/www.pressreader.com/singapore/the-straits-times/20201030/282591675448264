    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK The most fre­quently posed query in Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) cir­cles over the past weeks – When do you think next sea­son will start? – had also been one of the hard­est to an­swer.</p>
    <p>Even com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver, at a news con­fer­ence late last month be­fore Game 1 of the Fi­nals, told re­porters it was too soon for him to pro­vide de­tails in re­sponse “to most of your ques­tions” about the 2020-21 sea­son.</p>
    <p>That all changed last Fri­day af­ter a board of gov­er­nors meet­ing. Nu­mer­ous t eam own­ers sup­ported the league’s new plan to push for a Dec 22 start date – just 10 weeks af­ter the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers’ cham­pi­onship win over the Mi­ami Heat.</p>
    <p>The league of­fice can­not uni­lat­er­ally im­pose its pre­ferred timetable upon play­ers, but ne­go­ti­a­tions are un­der way be­fore the dead­line to­day to mod­ify the cur­rent labour agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Ex­pec­ta­tions are that the sides will strike a deal on the terms for next sea­son, such as set­ting the salary cap and lux­ury tax fig­ures and an over­hauled cal­en­dar with Dec 22 as open­ing night.</p>
    <p>These are the three main rea­sons a De­cem­ber start has sud­denly be­come the tar­get.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>THIS IS WHAT THE LEAGUE’S TELE­VI­SION PART­NERS WANT</p>
    <p>Through­out t he NBA’s three­month stay at Walt Dis­ney World, all signs pointed to the 2020-21 sea­son be­gin­ning in the new year. League in­sid­ers fre­quently cited mid-Jan­uary as the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>Play­ing the long game, it was of­ten sug­gested, would en­hance the chances of fan at­ten­dance for at least a part of the reg­u­lar sea­son.</p>
    <p>But since the sea­son ended, daunt­ing pro­jec­tions about the spread of the coro­n­avirus in win­ter have led to pes­simism about ad­mit­ting even small crowds any time soon.</p>
    <p>Teams thus be­gan to whis­per last week that mo­men­tum was build­ing to start the new sea­son around Dec 25 to pre­serve the abil­ity to broad­cast five games on Christ­mas Day.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney, which owns ESPN, badly wants to con­tinue that Christ­mas tra­di­tion and have five games to tele­vise on ei­ther ABC or ESPN.</p>
    <p>Turner, the NBA’s other pri­mary broad­cast part­ner, would get its tra­di­tional open­ing night dou­ble­header on a Tues­day if the union agrees to the Dec 22 pro­posal.</p>
    <p>The league, for its part, has in­formed the union that it projects a dif­fer­ence of US$500 mil­lion (S$682.6 mil­lion) in rev­enue if it can start the sea­son in De­cem­ber rather than mid-Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>GIV­ING FANS (AND PLAY­ERS) THEIR SUM­MERS BACK</p>
    <p>Start­ing the new sea­son be­fore Christ­mas would prob­a­bly en­able NBA play­ers to par­tic­i­pate in the Tokyo Olympics in July next year.</p>
    <p>The league wants to make that hap­pen, if pos­si­ble, which would also pre­vent high-pro­file NBA play-off games from clash­ing with the Sum­mer Games.</p>
    <p>But the big­ger mo­ti­va­tion for pre­vent­ing the play-offs from stray­ing too far into July is to avoid play­ing through­out the sum­mer for a se­cond suc­ces­sive sea­son, while also restor­ing free agency as the cen­tre­piece of the sum­mer cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>An­other in­escapable truth: Play­ers want their sum­mers back, too, es­pe­cially af­ter the de­mands of the bub­ble, with the Lak­ers and the Heat forced to spend nearly 100 days on an iso­lated cam­pus.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>SETS NBA UP FOR RE­TURN TO NOR­MALCY BY 2021-22</p>
    <p>It is a given that the 2020-21 sea­son can­not pos­si­bly pro­ceed as smoothly as bub­ble life did. Even if the are­nas are es­sen­tially empty, teams are de­ter­mined to play in their home mar­kets. Play­ers, coaches and team staff liv­ing at home and trav­el­ling would in­vite coro­n­avirus-re­lated risks.But mak­ing sure the 2020-21 sea­son ends in July at the lat­est would in­crease the NBA’s readi­ness for a tra­di­tional Oc­to­ber-to-June run in 2021-22, which ap­pears to be its next real op­por­tu­nity to re­gain ac­cess to the crowds, spon­sors and an­cil­lary arena in­come.</p>
