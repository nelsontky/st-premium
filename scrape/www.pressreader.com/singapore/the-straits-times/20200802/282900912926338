    <p>In the bed­room of her New York apart­ment, Ms Ali­son Mazur re­laxed into her chair while an aes­theti­cian coated her nails in taupe pol­ish. It was the first man­i­cure­pedi­cure she’d had in four months, since coron­avirus re­stric­tions forced sa­lons across the country to close their doors.</p>
    <p>“I was like, what the heck, I live in New York City – there’s got to be a com­pany that’s do­ing something to ac­com­mo­date self-care dur­ing this time,” she said.</p>
    <p>A Google search led her to MyS­pa2Go, which is based in the city and pro­vides at-home nail ser­vices, wax­ing, fa­cials, makeup, eye­lash ex­ten­sions, hair­cuts and mas­sages, for a pre­mium price. A deluxe man­i­cure-pedi­cure costs US$125 (S$172), no­tably higher than the usual price at a New York City nail sa­lon.</p>
    <p>Before the pan­demic, get­ting a man­i­cure, buy­ing a movie ticket, at­tend­ing an ex­er­cise class or going on a shop­ping trip were rel­a­tively affordable pas­times for the up­per­mid­dle class. But the virus has in­creas­ingly made these pur­suits even more ex­clu­sive – avail­able at a pre­mium for those af­flu­ent enough to en­joy them in a pri­vate set­ting.</p>
    <p>Miss going to the movies? For about US$350, you can rent an en­tire au­di­to­rium at Moviehouse & Eatery, a lux­ury theatre chain in Texas. Ea­ger to get back to your ex­er­cise rou­tine? Gymguyz, a personal train­ing com­pany in New York, of­fers so­cially dis­tanced one-on-one work­outs in cus­tomers’ homes or back­yards for up to US$100.</p>
    <p>If swim­ming is your thing, Swim­ply al­lows you to rent a pri­vate pool in some­one’s back­yard for up to US$60 an hour.</p>
    <p>De­mand for MyS­pa2Go’s ser­vices quadru­pled after the pan­demic hit, and the com­pany has a wait list of 10 to 15 peo­ple on any given day, its owner, Ms Lori Traub, said.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have been call­ing and beg­ging for ser­vices, telling us that they would pay any amount of money to have ser­vices done,” she said. “They were lit­er­ally say­ing: ‘ Charge me dou­ble. Charge me triple. I’ll pay any­thing to get ser­vice.’”</p>
    <p>Ms Traub said the com­pany had not raised prices sig­nif­i­cantly dur­ing the pan­demic. MyS­pa2Go re­quires all staff mem­bers to wear pro­tec­tive gear, in­clud­ing masks and gloves, while per­form­ing ser­vices and to use dis­pos­able tools as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Nema­colin Wood­lands Re­sort, set on 809ha in the Al­legheny Moun­tains of Penn­syl­va­nia, is of­fer­ing a so­cially dis­tanced re­treat ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>For as much as US$900 a night, guests get a but­ler who plans pri­vate leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing watch­ing movies solo at the re­sort’s theatre or en­joy­ing pri­vate use of its ten­nis courts, mu­se­ums or shops.</p>
    <p>High-end busi­nesses are also sell­ing one of the most sought-after com­modi­ties in the pan­demic era: child­care.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, Bev­erly Hills agency West­side Nan­nies has re­ceived an over­whelm­ing num­ber of re­quests for peo­ple with ex­pe­ri­ence as sum­mer camp coun­sel­lors to watch chil­dren, the bet­ter to plan one-on-one cam­p­like ac­tiv­i­ties, said Ms Katie Prov­inziano, the agency’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents are re­ally feel­ing like they want their kids to have some sense of nor­malcy and a lit­tle bit of that tra­di­tional sum­mer ex­pe­ri­ence within the con­fines of the pan­demic,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Vic­to­ria O’Fla­ha­van of West Hol­ly­wood, Cal­i­for­nia, hired a nanny through the agency to look after her three-year-old son while she tends to her new­born daugh­ter. The nanny, who charges US$28 an hour, or­ches­trates sum­mer­time ac­tiv­i­ties like plant­ing toma­toes in the garden and set­ting up a lemon­ade stand.</p>
    <p>“I like that he has something to look for­ward to, be­cause it’s been so long since he had in­ter­ac­tion with other kids, which just breaks my heart,” she said.</p>
    <p>Par­ents are also find­ing ways for their chil­dren to con­tinue pur­su­ing ath­letic am­bi­tions. In Hop­kins, Min­nesota, 43 Hoops Bas­ket­ball Acad­emy of­fers pri­vate train­ing for up to US$90 an hour.</p>
    <p>Elite Method, i n En­gle­wood, New Jersey, pro­vides “concierges­tyle” one-on-one sports coach­ing and men­tor­ing to chil­dren in their own back­yard for US$250 for a 90-minute ses­sion.</p>
