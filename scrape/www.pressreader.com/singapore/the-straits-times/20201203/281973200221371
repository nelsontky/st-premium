    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion says the avail­able ev­i­dence sug­gests that smok­ing is as­so­ci­ated with in­creased sever­ity of dis­ease and death in hos­pi­talised</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>In its press state­ments fol­low­ing the deaths of pa­tients due to Covid-19, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) has in­cluded in­for­ma­tion on co­mor­bidi­ties such as di­a­betes and hy­per­ten­sion. It has not stated whether any of the 29 pa­tients who died from Covid-19-re­lated com­pli­ca­tions was a smoker.</p>
    <p>Was smok­ing his­tory not part of the med­i­cal re­view, and hence there was no in­for­ma­tion for dis­clo­sure?</p>
    <p>Or was smok­ing his­tory or smok­ing sta­tus recorded, but deemed not nec­es­sary for dis­clo­sure?</p>
    <p>Smok­ing-re­lated dis­eases kill six peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore each day, ac­cord­ing to The To­bacco Atlas (Dis­eases linked to smok­ing kill 6 peo­ple daily, March 27, 2018).</p>
    <p>If in­deed there were smok­ers among the Covid-19-re­lated deaths here, MOH should dis­close this in­for­ma­tion in its press state­ments as a cau­tion­ary tale to would-be smok­ers not to start and to cur­rent smok­ers to quit. Lim Teck Koon</p>
    <p>Was smok­ing his­tory not part of the med­i­cal re­view, and hence there was no in­for­ma­tion for dis­clo­sure?</p>
