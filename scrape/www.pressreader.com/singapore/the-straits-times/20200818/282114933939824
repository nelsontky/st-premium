    <p>A prin­ci­pal fa­cil­i­ties man­ager of SMM, the fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment arm of in­fra­struc­ture con­sul­tancy Sur­bana Jurong Group, duped SMM into pay­ing more than $1 mil­lion to his ac­com­plices in a ruse in­volv­ing se­cret prof­its.</p>
    <p>Former man­ager Ong Kah Heng earned up to $60,000 from the scheme.</p>
    <p>To com­mit the of­fences be­tween 2005 and 2012, the Sin­ga­porean worked with the direc­tors of two firms that were SMM’s ap­proved sub­con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>They were Yap Kok Leong, 55, from con­struc­tion com­pany Day­con, and Leong Swee Sum from AOne Con­tract­ing Ser­vices which deals with in­te­rior dec­o­ra­tion. As a re­sult of the ruse, SMM paid the two firms for jobs they did not per­form.</p>
    <p>Ong, 60, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to four months’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to an amal­ga­mated cheat­ing charge.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Vin­cent Ong said that as part of its busi­ness, SMM ten­dered for main­te­nance con­tracts with its clients. It also acted as a man­ag­ing agent on the re­spec­tive sites un­der the con­tracts.</p>
    <p>One of the sites was Paya Le­bar Air­base, and Ong was posted there in 2005. As part of his job scope, he was tasked to over­see the site’s main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>The DPP said that to pur­port­edly cope with de­lays at the work site in­volv­ing ad hoc mi­nor re­pair works, Ong asked the work­ers al­ready per­form­ing jobs on-site to help out with the out­stand­ing tasks. Af­ter that, he paid them fixed amounts in cash up­front.</p>
    <p>To get re­im­burse­ment for these ex­penses and ob­tain prof­its, Ong pro­posed that Yap sub­mit in­voices through Day­con to SMM.</p>
    <p>He told Yap that the works would be car­ried out by work­ers he had ear­lier en­gaged and that this would be done with­out SMM’s knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Yap agreed and asked for for­mal in­voices to be sub­mit­ted to Day­con so that the trans­ac­tion could be pro­cessed.</p>
    <p>Ong asked Yap to have the in­voices sub­mit­ted to SMM un­der his father’s name: Ong Teow Eng.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the of­fences linked to Day­con in­volved 110 in­voices for a to­tal value of more than $1,072,000.</p>
    <p>Yap’s case is still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Ong also cheated SMM with a sim­i­lar ruse by rop­ing in Leong in 2009.</p>
    <p>The of­fence linked to A-One in­volved one in­voice for more than $17,000. The DPP said that Ong later gave Leong $2,000.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state how the of­fences came to light but SMM later started civil ac­tion against Ong for breach of du­ties owed to it.</p>
    <p>He agreed to pay the com­pany more than $20,000 to set­tle the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The DPP said that to pur­port­edly cope with de­lays at the work site in­volv­ing ad hoc mi­nor re­pair works, Ong asked the work­ers al­ready per­form­ing jobs on-site to help out with the out­stand­ing tasks. Af­ter that, he paid them fixed amounts in cash up­front.</p>
