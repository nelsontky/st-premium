    <p>Chi­nese video-shar­ing app Tik­Tok’s global pop­u­lar­ity be­came its curse in 2020.</p>
    <p>The app, owned by In­ter­net tech­nol­ogy com­pany ByteDance, hit new heights of pop­u­lar­ity this year.</p>
    <p>It started off strong by reach­ing a mile­stone of two bil­lion down­loads glob­ally in April.</p>
    <p>Yet within months, the dizzy­ingly pop­u­lar app found it­self at the cen­tre of a geopo­lit­i­cal war be­tween China and the United States.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said the app was a na­tional se­cu­rity risk and moved to ban new down­loads, on the grounds that data col­lec­tion posed the threat of giv­ing the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party ac­cess to Amer­i­cans’ per­sonal and pro­pri­etary in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok re­sponded by suc­cess­fully get­ting tem­po­rary court in­junc­tions against the ban, even as it de­nied it was a na­tional se­cu­rity threat, adding that it took “ex­tra­or­di­nary mea­sures” to pro­tect the pri­vacy and se­cu­rity of Tik­Tok’s US user data.</p>
    <p>But the US’ tight­en­ing of the screws on Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies is as much about dom­i­nance, as both su­per­pow­ers race to be lead­ers in fu­ture tech­nolo­gies and to cap­ture emerg­ing mar­kets.</p>
    <p>And Tik­Tok has been at the cen­tre of it all.</p>
    <p>This year saw the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion push­ing ByteDance through an ex­ec­u­tive or­der in Au­gust to sell its US op­er­a­tions to an Amer­i­can buyer.</p>
    <p>ByteDance has pro­posed to re­struc­ture Tik­Tok’s US op­er­a­tions as a new en­tity wholly owned by Or­a­cle, re­tailer Wal­mart and the Chi­nese group’s US in­vestors.</p>
    <p>But the deal is yet to be fi­nalised, with un­cer­tainty over the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok has had phe­nom­e­nal growth world­wide as mil­lions are at­tracted to its easy-to-use video for­mat of 15 to 60 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>The app lets users cre­ate ama­teur videos with var­i­ous fil­ters and see real-time re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Bal­loon­ing from about 55 mil­lion global users in Jan­uary 2018 to 271 mil­lion by De­cem­ber that same year, Tik­Tok’s user base fur­ther surged to 507 mil­lion by De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic saw peo­ple turn to the short-video for­mat to keep them­selves en­ter­tained while be­ing forced to stay at home.</p>
    <p>Yet this growth in pop­u­lar­ity has also seen it caught in the geopo­lit­i­cal cross hairs else­where too.</p>
    <p>This year, sev­eral coun­tries in­clud­ing Bri­tain and Aus­tralia have mulled over a ban on Tik­Tok.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment de­cided against a ban, re­ported the Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald, not­ing that se­cu­rity agen­cies have not found any na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing ten­sions be­tween China and Bri­tain also led to spec­u­la­tion that Tik­Tok could be af­fected.</p>
    <p>But it was only in In­dia that the gov­ern­ment went ahead with a Tik­Tok ban, cit­ing na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns on the back of bor­der troubles with China.</p>
    <p>A vi­o­lent clash in Gal­wan Val­ley in June in which sol­diers were</p>
    <p>killed trig­gered a bor­der fall­out that spread to mul­ti­ple points.</p>
    <p>Talks have yet to re­solve all is­sues in the worst bor­der troubles in over four decades.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok was the most high-pro­file of 267 Chi­nese apps, in­clud­ing Shein and PUBG Mo­bile, banned by the In­dian gov­ern­ment over the past six months.</p>
    <p>Half a year after the ban, no app has been able to take its place.</p>
    <p>About 40 per cent of Tik­Tok’s mar­ket share has shifted to new In­dian apps, with the most pop­u­lar be­ing Dai­ly­hunt’s Josh, Times’ MX TakaTak and InMobi’s Ro­poso, ac­cord­ing to con­sul­tancy firm RedSeer in a Dec 8 re­port.</p>
    <p>Key rea­sons be­hind why most Tik­Tok users in In­dia have re­fused to shift, said RedSeer, are a lack of qual­ity con­tent, lower num­ber of</p>
    <p>posts and fewer tools for con­tent cre­ation.</p>
    <p>“There is a view that Tik­Tok’s ab­sence has led to the over­all mar­ket stag­nat­ing, be­cause user en­gage­ment in short-form social video has on the whole de­clined,” said Mr Kailas Karthikeya­n, a New Delhi-based tech­nol­ogy pol­icy an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>“Even Face­book and Google, with their In­sta­gram Reels and YouTube Shorts, are not mak­ing much of an im­pact.</p>
    <p>“This speaks to the im­mense power of Tik­Tok’s real-time deeplearn­ing rec­om­men­da­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“It still is the most suc­cess­ful short-form social me­dia app in the world, be­ing very pop­u­lar in the US and Aus­tralia, coun­tries which have had no short­age of ten­sions with China this year.”</p>
    <p>The ques­tion now is whether Tik­Tok will con­tinue to be in the cross hairs as US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes over next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Santosh Pai, an in­ter­na­tional cor­po­rate lawyer and hon­orary fel­low at the In­sti­tute of Chi­nese Stud­ies, a New Delhi-based think-tank, said: “Of course with the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion com­ing in, there is some ex­pec­ta­tion the US may go easy on China.</p>
    <p>“But even if it goes easy on Chi­nese eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity be­cause it’s a big trad­ing part­ner, the In­ter­net do­main is the eas­i­est for the US to main­tain a hard line.”</p>
    <p>He added, some­what con­tro­ver­sially: “It’s not a needs-based re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>“You don’t need Tik­Tok.”</p>
