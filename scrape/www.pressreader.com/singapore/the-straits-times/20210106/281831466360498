    <p>•</p>
    <p>The emer­gence in Bri­tain and South Africa of two new vari­ants of Sars-CoV-2, which are po­ten­tially far more in­fec­tious ver­sions of the virus, has prompted wide­spread con­cern. Here is what we know – and what we do not – about the mu­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE THEY?</p>
    <p>All viruses mu­tate when they repli­cate in or­der to adapt to their en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have tracked mul­ti­ple mu­ta­tions of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, since it ap­peared in China in 2019. The vast ma­jor­ity of mu­ta­tions did not ma­te­ri­ally al­ter the virus’ vir­u­lence nor its trans­mis­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>But one mu­ta­tion – vari­ant B117, which likely emerged in Eng­land in Septem­ber – has now been de­tected in coun­tries across the world, in­clud­ing the United States, France and In­dia.</p>
    <p>An­other vari­ant, 501.V2, found in South Africa in Oc­to­ber, has since spread to sev­eral na­tions, in­clud­ing Bri­tain and France.</p>
    <p>Both have mul­ti­ple mu­ta­tions to the virus, most no­tably on its spike pro­tein – the part of the virus that latches on to hu­man cells and helps it spread.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, the mu­tated ver­sions have an al­tered re­cep­tor bind­ing do­main known as N501Y, which is sit­u­ated on the virus’ pro­tein spike and which al­lows eas­ier ac­cess to the ACE2 re­cep­tor in hu­man cells.</p>
    <p>This makes the mu­tated ver­sions po­ten­tially more in­fec­tious than other strains.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Cen­tre for Disease Con­trol (ECDC) says that while there is “no clear re­la­tion­ship” be­tween en­hanced ACE2 bind­ing and in­creased trans­mis­si­bil­ity, “it is plau­si­ble that such a re­la­tion­ship ex­ists”.</p>
    <p>ARE THEY MORE CON­TA­GIOUS?</p>
    <p>Sev­eral re­cent stud­ies – yet to be peer-re­viewed – have con­cluded that the Bri­tish vari­ant of SarsCoV-2 is likely to be far more trans­mis­si­ble than other strains.</p>
    <p>The Nerv­tag ex­pert com­mit­tee that ad­vises the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment on disease con­trol has es­ti­mated the new mu­ta­tion to be be­tween 50 per cent and 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A team at the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine (LSHTM) con­curs, with ex­perts putting in­creased trans­mis­si­bil­ity in the 50 to 74 per cent range.</p>
    <p>Last week, re­searchers at Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don re­leased the re­sults of a study into thou­sands of ge­netic se­quences of SarsCoV-2 found in Bri­tain be­tween Oc­to­ber and last month.</p>
    <p>They found that the new vari­ant had a “sub­stan­tial trans­mis­sion ad­van­tage”, with a re­pro­duc­tion rate be­tween 0.4 and 0.7 higher than the un­mu­tated virus.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary stud­ies on the South African vari­ant have also con­cluded that it is more con­ta­gious than reg­u­lar Sars-CoV-2.</p>
    <p>But Dr Bruno Coignard, head of in­fec­tious dis­eases at France’s heath au­thor­ity Sante Publique France, said the Bri­tish vari­ant’s spread was due to “a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors”.</p>
    <p>“These con­cern the virus’ char­ac­ter­is­tics but also preven­tion and con­trol mea­sures put in place,” he said.</p>
    <p>ARE THEY MORE DAN­GER­OUS?</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently no ev­i­dence to sug­gest that the mu­tated viruses are any stronger than nor­mal.</p>
    <p>But in­creased trans­mis­si­bil­ity alone poses an enor­mous prob­lem, given that a small but con­sis­tent per­cent­age of Covid-19 pa­tients re­quire hos­pi­tal care.</p>
    <p>“In­creased trans­mis­si­bil­ity even­tu­ally trans­lates to a far higher in­ci­dence rate, and even with the same mor­tal­ity, this means sig­nif­i­cant pres­sure on health sys­tems,” Dr Coignard said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Adam Kucharski, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at LSHTM, said a virus that is 50 per cent more con­ta­gious would be a “much big­ger prob­lem” than one that is 50 per cent more deadly.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained how a disease like Covid-19, with a re­pro­duc­tion (R) rate of 1.1 – where each pa­tient in­fects 1.1 others on av­er­age – and a mor­tal­ity rate of 0.8 per cent, would be ex­pected to pro­duce 129 deaths within a month.</p>
    <p>If the mor­tal­ity rate rose by 50 per cent, the num­ber of deaths would in­crease to 193. But ow­ing to the ex­po­nen­tial growth in cases with a more con­ta­gious vari­ant, a disease with a 50 per cent higher trans­mis­sion rate would see the death toll hit 978.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ar­naud Fontanet, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist with France’s sci­ence coun­cil, said the new Bri­tish vari­ant was “ex­tremely con­cern­ing right now”.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial stud­ies have also con­cluded that the Bri­tish vari­ant is much more con­ta­gious among young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The LSHTM study con­cluded that lock­downs sim­i­lar to those seen across Bri­tain in Novem­ber would be in­suf­fi­cient to stem the new vari­ant’s spread “un­less pri­mary schools, sec­ondary schools, and uni­ver­si­ties are also closed”.</p>
    <p>WILL THE VAC­CINES STILL WORK?</p>
    <p>As vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns get un­der way across the world, is there any rea­son to fear that the new mu­ta­tions may not re­spond to the host of vac­cines al­ready on the mar­ket?</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the mes­sen­ger RNA vac­cines de­vel­oped by Pfizer and Moderna trick the body into re­pro­duc­ing the virus’ spike pro­tein – the pre­cise part of the pathogen that has mu­tated in the new ver­sions.</p>
    <p>The ECDC said it was too soon to know if the mu­ta­tions will im­pact vac­cine ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>Last week, Dr Henry Walke from the US Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion said that “ex­perts be­lieve our cur­rent vac­cines will be ef­fec­tive against these strains”.</p>
    <p>But on Mon­day, Dr Fran­cois Bal­loux, pro­fes­sor of com­pu­ta­tional sys­tems bi­ol­ogy and di­rec­tor at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don’s Ge­net­ics In­sti­tute, said the South African vari­ant’s spike pro­tein mu­ta­tion “helps the virus to by­pass im­mune pro­tec­tion pro­vided by prior in­fec­tion or vac­ci­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>Ger­man vac­cine de­vel­oper BioNTech has said that if needed, it could de­velop a new vac­cine that would work on mu­tated ver­sions within six weeks.</p>
    <p>WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THE NEW VIRUS MU­TA­TIONS?</p>
    <p>Dr Coignard said it was im­pos­si­ble to erad­i­cate the new vi­ral vari­ants, although the goal from pol­i­cy­mak­ers should be “max­i­mum de­lay” of their spread.</p>
    <p>The ECDC says that in coun­tries cur­rently un­af­fected by the new mu­ta­tions, “ef­forts to de­lay the spread should mir­ror those made dur­ing the ear­lier stage of the pan­demic”. These in­clude tests and quar­an­tin­ing new ar­rivals, con­tact trac­ing and lim­ited travel.</p>
    <p>Prof Fontanet ad­vo­cates “ex­tremely ag­gres­sive sur­veil­lance” through wide­spread test­ing.</p>
    <p>“We need to be even more vig­i­lant in our preven­tion mea­sures to slow the spread of Covid-19 by wear­ing masks, stay­ing at least six feet apart from peo­ple we don’t live with, avoid­ing crowds, ven­ti­lat­ing in­door spa­ces and wash­ing our hands,” Dr Walke said.</p>
    <p>The ECDC said it was too soon to know if the mu­ta­tions will im­pact vac­cine ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>Last week, Dr Henry Walke from the US Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion said that “ex­perts be­lieve our cur­rent vac­cines will be ef­fec­tive against these strains”.</p>
