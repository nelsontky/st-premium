    <p>The open­ing Sept 4-6 leg of the Fina Swim­ming World Cup se­ries is the lat­est ma­jor lo­cal sport­ing event to fall vic­tim to the coro­n­avirus cri­sis. It was last called off in 2015 ow­ing to the haze, and fol­lows the can­cel­la­tion of the For­mula One night race and Sin­ga­pore rugby sevens, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore leg of the Fina Swim­ming World Cup, sched­uled for Sept 4-6, is the lat­est sport­ing event here to be can­celled as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) said yes­ter­day that the de­ci­sion was “in re­sponse to the con­tin­ued health con­cerns posed by Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>The an­nual com­pe­ti­tion, which the Repub­lic first hosted in 2007, at­tracts more than 6,000 spec­ta­tors and nearly 200 in­ter­na­tional swim­mers each time. Last year’s event fea­tured Sin­ga­porean Olympic cham­pion Joseph School­ing and Hun­gar­ian star Katinka Hosszu, win­ner of three Olympic golds and nine world ti­tles.</p>
    <p>The SSA said with the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion pro­hibit­ing mass gath­er­ings and im­pos­ing re­stric­tions on world­wide travel, “it is unattain­able to hold the event this year as peo­ple’s safety takes prece­dence”.</p>
    <p>SSA pres­i­dent Lee Kok Choy said the de­ci­sion was made fol­low­ing dis­cus­sions with Fina, swim­ming’s in­ter­na­tional gov­ern­ing body, and na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The health and safety of the fans, ath­letes and ev­ery­one in­volved in the run­ning of the event is our high­est pri­or­ity and we are sup­port­ive of the na­tion’s ef­fort to min­imise the trans­mis­sion of the Covid-19 and pro­tect our peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We are hop­ing that the sit­u­a­tion will get bet­ter and look­ing for­ward to host­ing the event next year. To all our swim­mers, of­fi­cials and fans – stay safe and keep swim­ming.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore event was the first of six stops in the se­ries, which has a to­tal prize purse of US$2.5 mil­lion (S$3.45 mil­lion). The de­ci­sion to can­cel the meet was sup­ported by the event’s pre­sent­ing spon­sor</p>
    <p>Yakult Sin­ga­pore and Fina pres­i­dent Julio C. Maglione.</p>
    <p>The only other time the event did not take place was in 2015, when it was called off due to the haze.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor sport­ing events here that have been can­celled be­cause of the coro­n­avirus in­clude golf’s HSBC Women’s World Cham­pi­onship (Fe­bru­ary), the Sun­down Marathon (May), foot­ball’s In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup (July), For­mula One’s Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix (Septem­ber), and the HSBC Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sevens (Oc­to­ber).</p>
    <p>The sched­ule for the Fina Swim­ming World Cup 2021 will be an­nounced at a later date.</p>
    <p>Six-time SEA Games 50m freestyle cham­pion Amanda Lim, who clinched a sil­ver in the mixed 4x50m freestyle re­lay at the 2018 edi­tion, felt the can­cel­la­tion was a pity but was not surprised.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old, who is work­ing as an in­no­va­tion as­so­ciate at Fuller­ton Health while train­ing eight times a week, added: “My last meet was the SEA Games (in De­cem­ber) and seven months with­out rac­ing is a bit dif­fi­cult be­cause I miss com­pet­ing. But health and safety are more im­por­tant, so I’ll just keep train­ing.”</p>
