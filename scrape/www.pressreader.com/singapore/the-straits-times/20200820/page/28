        HOME B4 THE STRAITS TIMES THURSDAY, AUGUST 20, 2020 | | | demand from the suspension of car sales over the circuit breaker period, for the buoyant prices.
Singapore Vehicle Traders Associatio­n president Eddie Loo said the fact that the next tender is three weeks away had also added pressure to the latest exercise.
“Bidders are worried that if they miss this round, they would have to wait three weeks for another chance,” he said.
COE tenders are held twice a month, and most exercises are two weeks apart. But as some months are longer, three-week gaps do occur occasional­ly. Mr Loo added that the market is still weak, but there is a backlog of orders, and the COE supply is expected to continue shrinking.
Yet, he said, the high premiums will not be sustainabl­e, given the economic downturn and job losses.
Indeed, Mr Ron Lim, sales and marketing head at Nissan agent Tan Chong Motor, noted that fresh bookings have slowed down.
“But the market is still trying to digest the backlog of orders collected during the circuit breaker,” he said.
