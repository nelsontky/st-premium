    <p>WELLING­TON • Fam­i­lies of vic­tims gunned down at two New Zealand mosques urged a judge to im­pose the tough­est pos­si­ble sen­tence, life with­out pa­role, on the gun­man as he showed no re­morse and ap­peared to smirk at one sur­vivor dur­ing a sen­tenc­ing hear­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Mir­wais Waziri, who was wounded dur­ing the at­tack last year at Christchur­ch’s Al Noor mosque, put aside his pre­pared court state­ment and ad­dressed white su­prem­a­cist Bren­ton Tar­rant di­rectly, af­ter see­ing that he did not have “any re­grets, any shame in his eyes”.</p>
    <p>“He does not re­gret any­thing,” said Mr Waziri in the High Court in Christchur­ch on day two of the sen­tenc­ing hear­ing.</p>
    <p>“Today you are called a ter­ror­ist and you proved to the world that us Mus­lims are not ter­ror­ists. I say to the peo­ple of New Zealand that ter­ror­ists do not have re­li­gion, race and colour,” said Mr Waziri, whose words drew ap­plause from the public gallery.</p>
    <p>Mr Nathan Smith, orig­i­nally from Bri­tain and a sur­vivor of the Al Noor mosque shoot­ing, also spoke di­rectly to Tar­rant, who sat in grey prison clothes, watched by guards.</p>
    <p>“When you get a free minute, which you will have plenty of. Funny, eh? Very funny. Maybe you should try to read the Qu­ran. It’s beau­ti­ful,” Mr Smith said, re­act­ing to Tar­rant’s ap­par­ent smirk.</p>
    <p>Tar­rant, a 29-year-old Aus­tralian, is sched­uled to be sen­tenced this week af­ter plead­ing guilty to 51 mur­ders, 40 at­tempted mur­ders and one charge of com­mit­ting a ter­ror­ist act dur­ing the shoot­ing ram­page last year in the city of Christchur­ch that he live-streamed on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Prose­cu­tors have told the court Tar­rant care­fully planned the at­tacks to cause max­i­mum car­nage by ac­cu­mu­lat­ing high-pow­ered firearms and am­mu­ni­tion, train­ing at ri­fle clubs and study­ing mosque lay­outs.</p>
    <p>A mur­der con­vic­tion car­ries a manda­tory sen­tence of life in prison. The judge can im­pose a life term with­out pa­role, a sen­tence that has never been used in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Ms Far­isha Razak said in a recorded mes­sage that Tar­rant did not de­serve any le­niency af­ter killing her fa­ther, Mr Ashraf Ali, who was vis­it­ing New Zealand from Fiji. “You made a game out of peo­ple’s lives,” she said. “You should not even be granted pa­role – ever.”</p>
    <p>Mr Zuhair Dar­wish, who lost his brother Kamel, said Tar­rant should re­ceive the harsh­est pos­si­ble sen­tence. “I know in New Zealand law they have re­moved the death penalty for hu­mans, but un­for­tu­nately he’s not a hu­man,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond day of a multi-day sen­tenc­ing hear­ing was ded­i­cated to al­low­ing sur­vivors and fam­ily mem­bers of vic­tims to ad­dress the court, in per­son and via video.</p>
    <p>Tar­rant, who is rep­re­sent­ing him­self, will be al­lowed to speak at some point dur­ing the hear­ing, al­though Judge Cameron Man­der has pow­ers to en­sure the High Court is not used as a plat­form for ex­trem­ist ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>While most of Tar­rant’s vic­tims were at Al Noor mosque, he killed seven peo­ple at the Lin­wood mosque be­fore be­ing de­tained en route to a third.</p>
    <p>The daugh­ter of a woman killed at the Lin­wood mosque chal­lenged Tar­rant to use his life in prison to con­sider the beauty of the diver­sity and free­dom he sought to de­stroy.</p>
    <p>Mr Ky­ron Gosse, nephew of 65-year old vic­tim Linda Arm­strong, said the shooter had come to New than triple the size of Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>“We are es­sen­tially liv­ing in a mega-fire era,” Cal­i­for­nia Depart­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion Santa Clara Unit Chief Jake Hess told re­porters, not­ing that the state has en­dured four of the five largest wild­fires in its his­tory dur­ing the past three years.</p>
    <p>Evac­uees be­gan re­turn­ing on Monday to homes and vine­yards torched by a gi­gan­tic blaze called the LNU Light­ning Com­plex wild­fire.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing’s left, but we’re safe,” said one man, who did not give his name in an on­line video show­ing ev­ery­thing but his pa­tio fur­ni­ture de­stroyed at his house near Va­cav­ille.</p>
    <p>Smoke from fires cre­ated un­healthy air qual­ity for a large swathe of north­ern Cal­i­for­nia and drifted as far away as Kansas.</p>
    <p>More than 14,000 fire­fight­ers, some who have been forced to work gru­elling 72-hour shifts, were as­signed to the wild­fires, with 91 fire crews trav­el­ling from seven states and Na­tional Guard troops ar­riv­ing from four states, Mr New­som said.</p>
    <p>Zealand as a guest, and used that priv­i­lege to de­stroy a fam­ily that had lived here for seven gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“Filled with his own racist agenda, this coward hid be­hind his big pow­er­ful guns and shot lit­tle old Linda from afar,” said Mr Gosse, who added that Tar­rant “stole our na­tion’s in­no­cence”.</p>
    <p>New Zealand had been rel­a­tively free from ma­jor gun vi­o­lence un­til the coun­try’s worst mass shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>He does not re­gret any­thing. Today you are called a ter­ror­ist and you proved to the world that us Mus­lims are not ter­ror­ists. I say to the peo­ple of New Zealand that ter­ror­ists do not have re­li­gion, race and colour.</p>
    <p>A TER­ROR­IST</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR MIR­WAIS WAZIRI, on Bren­ton Tar­rant, who car­ried out at­tacks on two mosques in Christchur­ch last year. Mr Waziri was wounded in the at­tack at Al Noor mosque.</p>
    <p>I know in New Zealand law they have re­moved the death penalty for hu­mans, but un­for­tu­nately he’s not a hu­man.</p>
    <p>IN­HU­MAN</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR ZUHAIR DAR­WISH, whose brother, Kamel, died in the shootings, on Tar­rant de­serv­ing the harsh­est pos­si­ble sen­tence. NOT EVEN PA­ROLE</p>
    <p>You made a game out of peo­ple’s lives. You should not even be granted pa­role – ever.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MS FAR­ISHA RAZAK, whose fa­ther, Mr Ashraf Ali, was killed in the at­tacks, on Tar­rant de­serv­ing no le­niency.</p>
