    <p>So­ci­ety should cul­ti­vate a cul­ture of reg­u­lar giv­ing to sup­port so­cial ser­vice agen­cies help­ing the needy and firms should also col­lab­o­rate with them to of­fer their skills. Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion Des­mond Lee (right) called for cor­po­rates and Sin­ga­pore­ans to go be­yond mon­e­tary do­na­tions at the Te­masek Trust Con­ver­sa­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ety should cul­ti­vate a cul­ture of reg­u­lar giv­ing over a sus­tained pe­riod to sup­port so­cial ser­vice agen­cies help­ing the vul­ner­a­ble, through good times and bad, and com­pa­nies should col­lab­o­rate with them to of­fer their skills.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion Des­mond Lee made this call at the Te­masek Trust Con­ver­sa­tion yes­ter­day to cor­po­rates and Sin­ga­pore­ans to go be­yond mon­e­tary do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Trust is the phil­an­thropic arm of Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the event, which fo­cuses this year on forg­ing in­no­va­tive ways for phi­lan­thropy in the face of the Covid-19 pan­demic, Mr Lee said this could be done by tack­ling ex­ist­ing key gaps in to­day’s giv­ing land­scape. He said many donors pre­fer fund­ing pro­grammes that di­rectly sup­port ben­e­fi­cia­ries and shy away from in­vest­ing in the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of the agen­cies that de­liver the pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“While we have started look­ing into the ways we can tackle these ex­ist­ing gaps, the Gov­ern­ment alone does not have all the an­swers. We in­vite cor­po­rate part­ners to jour­ney along­side us and de­velop more in­no­va­tive and sus­tain­able ways of giv­ing,” said Mr Lee, who is also Na­tional Developmen­t Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He com­mended Sin­ga­pore­ans for giv­ing gen­er­ously dur­ing the pan­demic, with more than $100 mil­lion do­nated to the Com­mu­nity Chest, Sayang Sayang Fund and Giv­ing.sg to­wards Covid-19-re­lated causes from Jan­uary to Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies have also stepped for­ward, he said, cit­ing Te­masek Foun­da­tion, which col­lab­o­rated with the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry and Early Child­hood Developmen­t Agency to dis­trib­ute face shields and hand sani­tiser to 650,000 chil­dren and teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Ground-up ef­forts have also pro­vided aid in the cri­sis, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>But he noted that the giv­ing land­scape is un­even, and un­met needs re­main. So­cial ser­vice agen­cies are fac­ing fund­ing chal­lenges for re­cur­rent long-term pro­grammes and get­ting fewer vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>“Long after Covid is sub­dued, so­cial and healthcare needs will con­tinue to grow and be­come even more com­plex, so we will need to make sure that public spend­ing, phil­an­thropic giv­ing, as well as vol­un­teerism, com­bine forces to drive</p>
    <p>TO­WARDS BET­TER OUT­COMES even bet­ter out­comes than they do to­day,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Giv­ing trends must do like­wise, go be­yond ‘si­los’ and evolve ac­cord­ingly to bet­ter meet these new com­plex and in­ter­linked needs.”</p>
    <p>The event also in­cluded a chat with Te­masek In­ter­na­tional ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive Dil­han Pil­lay San­drasegara, mod­er­ated by Mr Warren Fer­nan­dez, ed­i­tor of The Straits Times and ed­i­torin-chief of the English/Malay/ Tamil Me­dia Group of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>They dis­cussed the im­por­tance of col­lab­o­ra­tive phi­lan­thropy, with or­gan­i­sa­tions com­ing to­gether to share re­sources, pool ex­per­tise and catal­yse ideas to solve real-world chal­lenges for the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>PSA In­ter­na­tional group chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Chong Meng shared how agen­cies came to­gether to re­pur­pose 10 Sin­ga­pore Expo halls into com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There was also a panel dis­cus­sion hosted by The Ma­ju­rity Trust ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Martin Tan on new ways of giv­ing and help­ing oth­ers dur­ing the pan­demic. The pan­el­lists were Asia-Pa­cific lead of Google.org Mar­ija Ralic, Me­di­a­corp chief ex­ec­u­tive Tham Loke Kheng, Ninja Van Sin­ga­pore co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Lai Chang Wen and Vin­tage Ra­dio SG co-founder and Ra­dioac­tive man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and co-founder Aloy­sius Tan.</p>
    <p>Long after Covid is sub­dued, so­cial and healthcare needs will con­tinue to grow and be­come even more com­plex, so we will need to make sure that public spend­ing, phil­an­thropic giv­ing, as well as vol­un­teerism, com­bine forces to drive even bet­ter out­comes than they do to­day.</p>
