    <p>BUENOS AIRES • Se­bas­tian Gal­leguillo, an Ar­gen­tinian Par­a­lympic swim­mer, has found an un­usual way to train dur­ing an al­most four-month l ock­down in and around the coun­try’s cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The 18-year-old is part of Ar­gentina’s na­tional team com­pris­ing deaf swim­mers and he is train­ing to par­tic­i­pate in the 2021 Deafly­mpics in Brazil.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has, how­ever, led to the clo­sure of his lo­cal pool, forc­ing Gal­leguillo to innovate.</p>
    <p>With the help of his fa­ther, who is a brick­layer, he has made a makeshift “swim­ming pool” in his back­yard lo­cated in one of Buenos Aires’ neigh­bour­hoods. They have used plas­tic sheets, logs, an old tank and two metal drums, and fill­ing it with 400 litres of wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“We made do with what we had here and we started build­ing,” his fa­ther Ed­mundo Her­nan­dez, 47, said.</p>
    <p>“The first day was nail­ing logs on the floor, the sec­ond was putting sheets and plas­tics so that the wa­ter does not drain.</p>
    <p>“Later, we bought a 15m by 4m plas­tic (sheet) that forms a bag and that is what holds the wa­ter.”</p>
    <p>As it is win­ter in Ar­gentina, the pool is be­ing heated via wood burnt in a metal drum.</p>
    <p>The con­di­tions are not ideal for Gal­leguillo, who ad­mit­ted his time out of the wa­ter had been tough, but he is mak­ing do amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“I said to my mum, ‘I want to train again be­cause I am be­com­ing rigid,</p>
    <p>I am los­ing mo­bil­ity in my body.’ It’s not the same to train out­side as be­ing in the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“With swim­ming, I am one, I am com­pletely me. In there (the pool), I do not de­pend on my hear­ing, I am in the wa­ter and I only need my body to train.”</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian gov­ern­ment im­posed a manda­tory lock­down on March 20, which was sub­se­quently lifted in most parts of the coun­try, ex­cept for Buenos Aires.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, it an­nounced plans to ease re­stric­tions in the cap­i­tal, with the first phase – some shops and ser­vices have re­opened – last­ing un­til Aug 2 to pacify grow­ing un­rest.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s Covid-19 cases num­ber over 122,000, with around 2,200 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
