    <p>Three out of four Sin­ga­pore­ans con­sumed the arts via dig­i­tal me­dia last year, even be­fore Covid-19 drove arts per­for­mances on­line. This is a 14 per­cent­age point in­crease from 2017, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s lat­est Pop­u­la­tion Sur­vey On The Arts re­leased yes­ter­day. The bi­en­nial sur­vey showed markedly pos­i­tive trends across the board for arts at­ten­dances and per­cep­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore Covid-19 drove arts con­tent and con­sump­tion on­line, three out of four Sin­ga­pore­ans were con­sum­ing arts via dig­i­tal me­dia in 2019.</p>
    <p>This is a 14 per­cent­age point in­crease from 2017, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s (NAC) lat­est Pop­u­la­tion Sur­vey On The Arts re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mu­sic is the art form most con­sumed dig­i­tally at 52 per cent, fol­lowed by theatre at 41 per cent, while lit­er­ary arts showed the largest jump in on­line par­tic­i­pa­tion, climb­ing 30 per­cent­age points from 2017 to 39 per cent in 2019.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey at­trib­uted the bet­ter num­bers for lit­er­ary arts to “Read­ing sto­ries, po­etry or graphic nov­els” be­ing asked as a stand­alone ques­tion which bet­ter cap­tured read­ing habits.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial sur­vey in­ter­viewed 1,176 Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents for their per­cep­tions of the value of arts and cul­ture as well as their en­gage­ment with arts and cul­ture.</p>
    <p>This 11th edi­tion of the sur­vey showed markedly pos­i­tive trends across the board for arts at­ten­dances and per­cep­tions in Sin­ga­pore. Phys­i­cal at­ten­dances in­creased to 69 per cent, up 15 per­cent­age points from 2017 and each per­son at­tended 7.6 events com­pared with 5.4 events in 2017.</p>
    <p>This rate of phys­i­cal at­ten­dance is the sec­ond high­est ob­served since the sur­vey be­gan, sec­ond only to 2015, which peaked at 78 per cent dur­ing SG50 cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Lit­er­ary arts and her­itage ac­tiv­i­ties were the most pop­u­lar, with 41 per cent and 40 per cent of re­spon­dents re­spec­tively say­ing they had at­tended at l east one event in these cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Over­all per­cep­tions of the arts also im­proved, with 80 per cent of the re­spon­dents say­ing that the arts and cul­ture were a source of pride and 78 per cent say­ing that it im­proved the qual­ity of life.</p>
    <p>While the num­bers are pos­i­tive for l ast year, the NAC said it ex­pected a drop this year due to the pan­demic and venue clo­sures dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. Field­work was con­ducted in Fe­bru­ary and March and the NAC noted that even at that early stage of the pan­demic, two in 10 at­ten­dees said that they in­tended to re­duce the fre­quency of their at­ten­dance of arts events.</p>
    <p>The NAC added in a state­ment: “It is ex­pected that the slow­down in the econ­omy may cause peo­ple to tighten their purse strings and be more se­lec­tive in at­tend­ing arts events and ac­tiv­i­ties, as well as de­crease phys­i­cal par­tic­i­pa­tion in arts events to avoid Covid-19 risks.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Rosa Daniel, 56, NAC’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, said: “The 2019 sur­vey re­sults strongly af­firm the value of the arts and cul­ture in Sin­ga­pore. Prior to the Covid sit­u­a­tion, all key in­di­ca­tors on ap­pre­ci­a­tion and con­sump­tion of the arts have shown strong pos­i­tive trends.</p>
    <p>Our artists and arts groups have contribute­d to a vi­brant arts scene, which en­hances the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans and the live­abil­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“With the im­pact of Covid-19, the NAC is cog­nisant of the chal­lenges ahead and will draw on the Arts and Cul­ture Re­silience Pack­age of $55 mil­lion to con­tinue sup­port­ing our artists and arts groups.”</p>
    <p>She added that the NAC will con­duct a se­ries of “dip­stick sur­veys to get a read­ing of au­di­ences’ readi­ness to come back and par­tic­i­pate in the arts, as well as their open­ness to dig­i­tal arts of­fer­ings, so that our artists and arts groups can make the nec­es­sary piv­ots”.</p>
