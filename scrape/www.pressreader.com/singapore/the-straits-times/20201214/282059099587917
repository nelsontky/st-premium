    <p>In two weeks, mem­bers of the Work­ers’ Party (WP) will vote on the party’s next cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee (CEC).</p>
    <p>They will elect the WP’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral and chair­man for the next two years, as well as 12 other mem­bers of the party’s top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body.</p>
    <p>One of the big ques­tions this year is whether WP chair­man Sylvia Lim, who has held the post since 2003, will make way for new blood as lead­er­ship re­newal con­tin­ues in the party.</p>
    <p>The WP’s last in­ter­nal elec­tion in 2018 saw then party chief Low Thia Khi­ang step­ping down af­ter 17 years at the helm as sec­re­tarygen­eral, and Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh elected un­op­posed to the seat.</p>
    <p>Party in­sid­ers told The Straits Times that the list of peo­ple up for elec­tion will be out on Dec 27, when the polls take place.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao first re­ported yes­ter­day on the WP’s in­ter­nal elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pos­si­ble con­tenders for the post of chair­man in­clude Hougang MP Den­nis Tan and Alju­nied GRC MP Ger­ald Giam, said Mr Leonard Lim, coun­try di­rec­tor at re­gional govern­ment af­fairs con­sul­tancy Vriens & Part­ners.</p>
    <p>Both men are cur­rent CEC mem­bers and were men­tored by Mr Low, he said, not­ing that they will ap­peal to the WP’s tra­di­tional Man­darin and di­alect-speak­ing base, but still en­gage well with younger English-speak­ing sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>He added that at least one of the new Sengkang MPs – for in­stance, Sengkang Town Coun­cil chair­man He Ting Ru – is likely to be in the new CEC.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Tan from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s l aw school said it would not be a sur­prise if Mr Low, as well as CEC mem­bers Chen Show Mao and Png Eng Huat, stood down al­to­gether from their posts.</p>
    <p>All three were for­mer MPs, but did not con­test the most re­cent gen­eral elec­tion (GE).</p>
    <p>“The ac­cent will be on change, re­newal and growth,” Prof Tan said, adding that some, if not all, of the five new MPs are likely to join the CEC.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts dif­fered, how­ever, in their views on the im­pact that the on­go­ing Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil court case would have on the party’s new CEC.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan pointed out that the case did not fea­ture strongly in the WP’s last in­ter­nal elec­tion, and is sim­i­larly un­likely to be a ma­jor con­sid­er­a­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Even if Mr Singh and Ms Lim, who were found li­able for var­i­ous breaches, are un­suc­cess­ful i n their ap­peal, it would af­fect their sta­tus as MPs rather than as CEC mem­bers, he said.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lim felt that the court case would be a con­sid­er­a­tion for the party, even if the out­come is couched pub­licly as a lead­er­ship re­newal.</p>
    <p>“The WP is in a de­cent po­si­tion to have a new chair­man who will not be dis­tracted by the le­gal pro­ceed­ings, and who can fo­cus on build­ing on its strong show­ing in the last GE,” he said.</p>
