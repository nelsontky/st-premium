    <p>Black­pink con­tinue to set records – this time with the high­est first-week album sales for a K-pop girl group with their lat­est re­lease, The Album.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing mu­sic sales tracker Han­teo Chart, their agency YG En­ter­tain­ment said the phys­i­cal album sold around 590,000 copies in just one day since its re­lease on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The group’s first full-length album, which in­cludes tracks such as Lovesick Girls, How You Like That and Ice Cream, was re­leased on­line on Oct 2, be­fore the hard copy was re­leased this week.</p>
    <p>Their mu­sic video for How You Like That be­came the fastest video in YouTube his­tory to reach 100 mil­lion views – in 32 hours. Black­pink are the top mu­sic group on YouTube with 50.3 mil­lion sub­scribers, just be­hind Cana­dian pop star Justin Bieber’s 57.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, The Korea Her­ald re­ported that YG is con­sid­er­ing edit­ing a scene in their Lovesick Girls mu­sic video fol­low­ing an out­cry over mem­ber Jen­nie’s nurse out­fit.</p>
    <p>In the video re­leased on Oct 2, Jen­nie is dressed in red high heels and a white nurse cos­tume – spark­ing so­cial me­dia posts with hash­tags such as #Stop_Sex­u­al­iz­ing_Nurses and #nurse_is_pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>In an of­fi­cial state­ment re­leased on Tues­day, YG said: “The scene show­ing a nurse and a pa­tient in the Lovesick Girls MV comes from the lyrics ‘no doc­tor could help when I’m lovesick’. We had no spe­cific in­ten­tion and are wor­ried about the dis­torted views.</p>
    <p>“We ask that peo­ple watch MV as an in­de­pen­dent art genre and un­der­stand that the scenes do not have any other in­ten­tion (other) than ex­press­ing the mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>They added: “The pro­duc­ers are con­tem­plat­ing and dis­cussing edit­ing the spe­cific scene.”</p>
    <p>YG’s re­sponse came a day af­ter the Korean Health and Med­i­cal Work­ers’ Union posted a com­ment on its web­site crit­i­cis­ing YG for the sex­ual por­trayal of nurses. “De­spite many nurses fight­ing to re­duce the sex­ual por­trayal of nurses, in 2020, when talk of women’s rights is more ac­tive than ever, YG En­ter­tain­ment sex­u­ally por­trayed a nurse in its Black­pink MV. If pop cul­ture re­peats dis­torted images of nurses, the sit­u­a­tion will get worse,” it said.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic video has more than 110 mil­lion views on YouTube and the album shot to No. 1 on iTunes in over 50 re­gions upon its re­lease.</p>
    <p>Black­pink are set to re­lease their Net­flix doc­u­men­tary, Light Up The Sky, next Wed­nes­day. The trailer, re­leased on Tues­day, fea­tures live footage, their 2019 Coachella per­for­mance and in­ter­views with each mem­ber of the group as they re­flect on their jour­ney to global star­dom.</p>
