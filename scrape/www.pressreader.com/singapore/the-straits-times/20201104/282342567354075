    <p>Em­ploy­ers who have re­ceived wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) will not have to pay in­come tax on the sub­si­dies, as part of new rules passed in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Those who have re­ceived gov­ern­ment pay­outs un­der the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs) or Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, among other schemes, also do not have to pay in­come tax on these pay­outs, after changes were made to the In­come Tax Act.</p>
    <p>The ex­emp­tions will ap­ply for the year of assess­ment 2021 or 2022, de­pend­ing on when pay­outs were made.</p>
    <p>Pre­sent­ing the Bill for de­bate yes­ter­day, Sec­ond Fi­nance Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said: “This will al­low cit­i­zens and busi­ness own­ers to ben­e­fit from the full amount of the sup­port mea­sures, with­out hav­ing to pay tax on them.”</p>
    <p>The JSS, which com­prises wage sub­si­dies to help re­tain lo­cal work­ers, was re­cently ex­tended to cover wages paid up to next March for com­pa­nies in sec­tors hit harder by the Covid-19 cri­sis, and up to next month for sec­tors that are man­ag­ing well.</p>
    <p>The sub­sidy funds up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each Sin­ga­porean or per­ma­nent res­i­dent em­ployee.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sirs dis­burses up to a to­tal of $9,000 in cash over nine months to each el­i­gi­ble self-em­ployed per­son.</p>
    <p>And the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant pro­vides up to $800 a month for three months to Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who have lost their jobs.</p>
    <p>Changes were also made to rules gov­ern­ing the goods and ser­vices tax (GST) to al­low the au­thor­i­ties to take stricter mea­sures to counter the prac­tice of miss­ing trader fraud.</p>
    <p>As at last De­cem­ber, more than 300 busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore au­dited were sus­pected to be in­volved in such prac­tices, and the to­tal GST in­volved is about $450 mil­lion, said</p>
    <p>SEC­OND FI­NANCE MIN­IS­TER LAWRENCE WONG, on wage sub­si­dies be­ing ex­empt from taxes for em­ploy­ers un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme and for peo­ple who re­ceived pay­outs un­der the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who is also Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Miss­ing trader fraud oc­curs when a seller dis­ap­pears after col­lect­ing the GST charged on sales and does not hand it over to the tax­man. Mean­while, other busi­nesses along the sup­ply chain con­tinue to claim re­funds of GST in­curred on their pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Fraud­sters are thus able to ex­tract cash from the GST sys­tem.</p>
    <p>To counter this, the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore will be al­lowed to deny the GST re­fund claims by a busi­ness if the com­pany knew or should have known that the pur­chase was part of a fraud­u­lent ar­range­ment, among other things, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>More will also be done to de­ter tax avoid­ance ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Er­rant tax­pay­ers will face a sur­charge equal to 50 per cent of the ad­di­tional GST or ad­di­tional in­come tax payable, as part of changes to the In­come Tax Act and GST Act.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently no sur­charges im­posed for such ar­range­ments, and those who have flouted the rules are re­quired to pay only the orig­i­nal amount of taxes due.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Work­ers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC), who had asked for an up­date on the progress of the Gov­ern­ment’s study on levy­ing a tax on e-com­merce trans­ac­tions for im­ported goods, Mr Wong said there will be up­dates on the is­sue in time.</p>
    <p>He added that while GST is levied on the im­port of dig­i­tal ser­vices – com­monly re­ferred to as the “Net­flix tax” – tax­ing e-com­merce trans­ac­tions is more com­plex, as ship­ments can be sent to dif­fer­ent coun­tries in or­der to by­pass tax.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the Gov­ern­ment is con­tin­u­ing to study this mat­ter care­fully to see how a proper tax regime can be put in place</p>
    <p>BEN­E­FIT FROM FULL AMOUNT</p>
    <p>This will al­low cit­i­zens and busi­ness own­ers to ben­e­fit from the full amount of the sup­port mea­sures, with­out hav­ing to pay tax on them.</p>
