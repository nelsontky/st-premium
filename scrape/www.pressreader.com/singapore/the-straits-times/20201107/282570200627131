    <p>BE­COM­ING MORE CON­FI­DENT</p>
    <p>There are some early signs of op­ti­mism. Cus­tomers are slowly be­com­ing more con­fi­dent about air travel, given the ro­bust health and safety mea­sures that have been put in place by air­lines, air­ports and gov­ern­ments. SIN­GA­PORE AIR­LINES</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ (SIA) net loss in the sec­ond quar­ter is dou­ble that in the first quar­ter as it re­ported a record net loss of $3.47 bil­lion for the six months to Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The Q2 losses came on the back of an im­pair­ment charge for older air­craft as well as $42 mil­lion in re­trench­ment costs.</p>
    <p>The na­tional car­rier re­ported a loss of $1.1 bil­lion for the first quar­ter to June. With H1 loss com­ing in at $3.47 bil­lion, it means that it bled about $2.3 bil­lion – twice the loss in Q1 – in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The H1 net loss was a re­ver­sal from a $206 mil­lion profit for April to Septem­ber last year, be­fore it was blind­sided by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue was 80.4 per cent down at $1.63 bil­lion for the first half of FY2021, com­pared with $8.3 bil­lion in the pre­ced­ing year.</p>
    <p>The hit from the pan­demic has not only re­sulted in a steep de­cline in rev­enue, but also led the group to book an im­pair­ment of $1.33 bil­lion on the car­ry­ing val­ues of older-gen­er­a­tion air­craft, said the car­rier in a state­ment yes­ter­day re­leased af­ter trad­ing hours.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the im­pair­ment on air­craft, SIA has fully writ­ten down the good­will of $170 mil­lion that was recorded when it took con­trol of Tiger Air­ways in Oc­to­ber 2014.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise which cut 2,000 jobs had cost the group $42 mil­lion, SIA dis­closed for the first time since its an­nounce­ment in Septem­ber on the axe fall­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, it said it has skipped an in­terim div­i­dend “in view of the sig­nif­i­cant loss in­curred and the need to con­serve cash”.</p>
    <p>SIA said in­dus­try air­freight ca­pac­ity is an­tic­i­pated to re­main con­strained be­cause of lower bel­ly­hold ca­pac­ity aris­ing from fewer pas­sen­ger flights.</p>
    <p>This is ex­pected to keep cargo yields and load fac­tors high in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>It ex­pects to see a pro­gres­sive re­cov­ery in gen­eral cargo de­mand, and con­tin­ued strong de­mand from phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and per­ish­ables. Cargo de­mand is also ex­pected to get a boost from the big e-com­merce sales days and new prod­uct launches, SIA said.</p>
    <p>Hence, it will con­tinue to grow the group’s ca­pac­ity to meet de­mand and ex­pand the cargo net­work by de­ploy­ing pas­sen­ger air­craft on ded­i­cated cargo op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the group’s Dis­cover Your Sin­ga­pore Air­lines suite of ex­pe­ri­ences – which in­clude in-flight din­ing in a sta­tion­ary A380 plane – have seen an over­whelm­ing re­sponse from lo­cal res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>“We know that many peo­ple have signed up sim­ply to show their sup­port for Sin­ga­pore Air­lines. For that, we are very grate­ful, and will never take it for granted,” the car­rier said.</p>
    <p>SIA noted that re­cov­ery is likely to re­main patchy, given the new waves of in­fec­tions around the world.</p>
    <p>“Nonethe­less, there are some early signs of op­ti­mism. Cus­tomers are slowly be­com­ing more con­fi­dent about air travel, given the ro­bust health and safety mea­sures that have been put in place by air­lines, air­ports and gov­ern­ments.”</p>
    <p>SIA shares closed one Sin­ga­pore cent higher at $3.48 yes­ter­day, be­fore the fi­nan­cial re­sults were re­leased.</p>
