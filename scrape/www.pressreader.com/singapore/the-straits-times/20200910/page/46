It is in line with the national effort to ramp up testing capacities with Singapore having moved into phase two of its reopening.
The clinics are part of a 900-wide network of Public Health Preparedne­ss Clinics (PHPCs) spread across the island, out of which 400 are equipped to allow anyone aged 13 and above diagnosed with acute respirator­y infection (ARI) symptoms to get tested for the coronaviru­s.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) had previously said the strategy is to test everyone diagnosed with ARI once there is sufficient testing capacity.
