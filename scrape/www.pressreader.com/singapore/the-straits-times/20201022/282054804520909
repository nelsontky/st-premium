    <p>The Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) has made a po­lice re­port against for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando fol­low­ing al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct made against him.</p>
    <p>It had also ad­vised the two fe­male stu­dents who ac­cused Dr Fer­nando of mis­con­duct to do the same.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night, NUS said it made the re­port “given the se­ri­ous­ness of the al­le­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>The uni­ver­sity also pro­vided a de­tailed time­line of when it first be­came aware of the al­le­ga­tions against Dr Fer­nando, and the ac­tions it took – which in­cluded in­ter­view­ing him and bar­ring him from mak­ing con­tact with stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that Dr Fer­nando “had an in­ti­mate as­so­ci­a­tion” with an un­der­grad­u­ate – a se­ri­ous breach of its code of con­duct for staff, NUS said. The uni­ver­sity thus sacked him on Oct 7.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing crit­i­cisms from stu­dents about the way it han­dled the mat­ter, NUS said: “We recog­nise that we could have shared in­for­ma­tion about the dis­missal with Tem­busu staff and stu­dents in a more timely man­ner and we en­deav­our to do bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, it felt it had to bal­ance the in­ter­ests of pri­vacy and con­fi­den­tial­ity, par­tic­u­larly for the vic­tims in­volved, it added.</p>
    <p>“The col­lege places the ut­most pri­or­ity on the safety and well-be­ing of its stu­dents. When the in­ci­dent was made known to the col­lege, it im­me­di­ately took ac­tion to pro­tect the stu­dent com­mu­nity and worked with the VCU to fa­cil­i­tate a fair and prompt in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” the uni­ver­sity said, re­fer­ring to the Vic­tim Care Unit.</p>
    <p>NUS said it had re­ceived a com­plaint from a stu­dent on Aug 27.</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando was sus­pended on Aug 31, and was stopped from go­ing to the uni­ver­sity other than to as­sist in in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>NUS in­ter­viewed Dr Fer­nando on Sept 1 on the com­plaint. It com­pleted its in­ves­ti­ga­tion into this case four days later on Sept 5.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond stu­dent made a com­plaint on Sept 7. She was in­ter­viewed about it two days later.</p>
    <p>NUS said it spoke to both the al­leged vic­tims, and put them in touch with an of­fi­cer from the VCU. Uni­ver­sity staff spoke to them about mak­ing a po­lice re­port and as­sured them of sup­port, in­clud­ing ac­com­pa­ny­ing them to the po­lice sta­tion.</p>
    <p>NUS, re­fer­ring to the Vic­tim Care Unit.</p>
    <p>Both stu­dents opted not to make po­lice reports, said NUS in its state­ment.</p>
    <p>On Sept 14, Dr Fer­nando was is­sued an or­der not to speak to the sec­ond stu­dent.</p>
    <p>NUS com­pleted in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the sec­ond case on Sept 21. On the same day, Dr Fer­nando was in­formed of the al­le­ga­tions against him and given seven work­ing days to re­spond. He did so on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>On Oct 7, NUS told Dr Fer­nando he was sacked. It also in­formed the two stu­dents and aca­demic staff of this de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The VCU of­fi­cer again spoke to the stu­dents about mak­ing a po­lice re­port. They both de­cided not to.</p>
    <p>On Oct 18, the col­lege in­formed all staff and stu­dents about Dr Fer­nando’s dis­missal and con­tin­ued face-to-face en­gage­ment with stu­dents and staff in small groups. The next day, the care of­fi­cer con­tacted the two stu­dents to check on them and Tem­busu Col­lege con­tin­ued its face-to-face en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>Tem­busu Col­lege said it will con­tinue to ad­dress stu­dents’ con­cerns. The two women are be­ing sup­ported by the care of­fi­cer, it said, adding that col­lege direc­tors will also con­tinue sup­port­ing the one who is un­der their care.</p>
    <p>NUS also said that it has, in re­sponse to a re­quest from the NUS Stu­dents’ Union, made the code of con­duct for staff pub­licly avail­able.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the code of con­duct stip­u­lates that staff mem­bers must not en­gage in an in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ship with an un­der­grad­u­ate stu­dent, and en­sure that they do not place them­selves in a po­si­tion of con­flict of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The two fe­male un­der­grad­u­ates, who ear­lier spoke to The Straits Times about the case, did not want to be named or give their ages.</p>
    <p>One of the women al­leged that Dr Fer­nando made non-con­sen­sual sex­ual ad­vances, such as kiss­ing and grop­ing her, and per­formed oral sex while she was drunk.</p>
    <p>The other woman al­leged that he tried touch­ing her and kiss­ing her. He later told her not to tell any­one, and that if she did not keep it a se­cret, he would lose his job.</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando has not re­sponded to queries by ST.</p>
    <p>The po­lice con­firmed last night that a re­port has been made and in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The col­lege places the ut­most pri­or­ity on the safety and well-be­ing of its stu­dents. When the in­ci­dent was made known to the col­lege, it im­me­di­ately took ac­tion to pro­tect the stu­dent com­mu­nity and worked with the VCU to fa­cil­i­tate a fair and prompt in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
