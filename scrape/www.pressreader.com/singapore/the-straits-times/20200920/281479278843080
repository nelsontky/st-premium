    <p>With the Gov­ern­ment clamp­ing down on food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets for flout­ing Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures last week­end, es­tab­lish­ments in pop­u­lar spots, such as Bugis, Or­chard Road and Tan­jong Pa­gar, have also come un­der greater scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors have been mak­ing daily checks in th­ese ar­eas, F&B op­er­a­tors said.</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times vis­ited close to 30 F&B out­lets in th­ese ar­eas on Fri­day night, many of the es­tab­lish­ments were bustling with ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Most op­er­a­tors The Sun­day Times spoke to said they ei­ther had to re­ject groups larger than five or split them into sep­a­rate ta­bles not next to each other.</p>
    <p>Ms Dyan Moreno, su­per­vi­sor at Korean bar­be­cue restau­rant 2D1N Soju Bang in Tan­jong Pa­gar Road, said it en­coun­tered groups larger than five on a nightly ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times ob­served a group of eight, which had made a reser­va­tion, be­ing ush­ered to its up­stairs seat­ing area.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore we ac­cept the reser­va­tion, we in­form them that they will be seated at sep­a­rate ta­bles and can­not switch (seats). We usu­ally put them quite far apart so that they can­not min­gle,” Ms Moreno said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other Korean BBQ joints on the same stretch said they re­ject groups larger than five, even if they are mem­bers of the same house­hold, as it is dif­fi­cult to as­cer­tain if they are liv­ing at the same ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The owner of a hot pot restau­rant in Liang Seah Street, who de­clined to be named, said he ac­cepts only groups of up to five be­cause he feels that there is a lack of clar­ity on the per­mit­ted group ca­pac­ity, and whether the restau­rant will be pe­nalised for tak­ing in larger groups, even if they are seated separately.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally not worth the $1,000 fine if we are caught flout­ing the rules, so we pre­fer to play it safe by ac­cept­ing only groups of five,” he said. “In ad­di­tion, tak­ing in big­ger groups would mean that more man­power has to be de­ployed to en­sure that th­ese ta­bles don’t min­gle, which gets dif­fi­cult to man­age es­pe­cially on crowded days like Fri­days and Satur­day nights.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, some other restau­rants on the same stretch ap­peared to be fla­grantly flout­ing the rules.</p>
    <p>This was the case at a Chi­nese skew­ers restau­rant, where The Sun­day Times ob­served a group of nine pa­trons seated out­doors on two sep­a­rate ta­bles, in­ter­min­gling with one an­other through­out their meal.</p>
    <p>One par­tic­u­lar mem­ber of the group con­sis­tently moved be­tween the two ta­bles to in­ter­act with his friends, and the waiter from the restau­rant was also seen to oc­ca­sion­ally join the two ta­bles for drinks.</p>
    <p>En­force­ment fig­ures on er­rant eater­ies for Fri­day and yes­ter­day were not im­me­di­ately avail­able.</p>
    <p>At Bot­toms Up, a bar in Telok Ayer Street which The Sun­day Times un­der­stands was is­sued a fine ear­lier this month for not com­ply­ing with safe man­age­ment mea­sures, pa­trons were seen drink­ing and stand­ing around out­door ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Owner Kapi­lan Shan­mugam said it has re­ceived in­quiries from groups, in­clud­ing those who wanted to hold cel­e­bra­tions at the bar. But th­ese have been turned away as they are likely to min­gle.</p>
    <p>“For other groups, such as for a group of seven, we split them into two ta­bles with a gap in be­tween. They can still see each other, but they’re sep­a­rated,” Mr Kapi­lan said, adding that the bar has re­moved a few ta­bles since it re­ceived the fine.</p>
    <p>The bar cur­rently op­er­ates at about 70 per cent of its preCovid-19 ca­pac­ity of about 100.</p>
    <p>An em­ployee at Blu Jaz Cafe in Bali Lane, who wanted to be known only as Mr Christo­pher, said the cafe’s last or­der for al­co­hol is at 9.30pm, and its cus­tomers are told to fin­ish their drinks by 10.15pm, so that staff would have am­ple time to clear up by 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>“There are some occasions of er­rant cus­tomers who get rowdy when they’re drunk and are un­co­op­er­a­tive when we have to start keep­ing their drinks, but we’re just gen­er­ally able to keep things un­der con­trol. Most of our cus­tomers have been help­ful and re­spect­ful of the rules, which we re­ally ap­pre­ci­ate.”</p>
    <p>Boat Quay, with its stretch of wa­ter­ing holes in Cir­cu­lar Road and fac­ing the Sin­ga­pore river­front, was buzzing as usual, with­out a red­shirted safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador in sight. Yet din­ers and eater­ies were mostly com­pli­ant, with sev­eral wrap­ping up busi­ness and clear­ing out cus­tomers well be­fore the 10.30pm cut-off.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar dive bar Mogambo in Can­ton Street was packed to the brim with ta­bles when The Sun­day Times vis­ited at around 9.45pm. But by around 10.30pm, it was lights out at the venue, which was cleared of all glasses, cus­tomers and even its out­door ta­bles.</p>
    <p>At sev­eral eater­ies fac­ing the river, staff were ob­served ex­plain­ing to cus­tomers why they had to clear glasses early, even hov­er­ing at the ta­ble or keep­ing a close eye on them as they fin­ished their drinks as the 10.30pm dead­line drew near. But most cus­tomers did not kick up a fuss and did as they were told.</p>
    <p>Over at the heart of Or­chard Road, Emer­ald Hill, with its slate of long-run­ning bars tucked away in re­stored shop­houses, was a model im­age for safe dis­tanc­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Mr Tanan Tay, head of op­er­a­tions of three Emer­ald Hill es­tab­lish­ments – Span­ish tapas bar Que Pasa, cock­tail bar No.5 Emer­ald Hill and bar Ice-Cold Beer – said they are now op­er­at­ing at around 40 per cent ca­pac­ity com­pared with preCovid-19 times.</p>
    <p>En­try points to the sis­ter venues are now lo­cated along the five-foot way in­stead of the shop­house front, in or­der to con­trol the crowd com­ing in. Cus­tomers are also en­cour­aged to leave their phone num­bers with the bars so that staff can call them once a ta­ble is avail­able, in­stead of hav­ing them wait in line out­side.</p>
    <p>The staff have been briefed to han­dle in­stances of in­ter-min­gling be­tween ta­bles, which Mr Tay ac­knowl­edged is “hu­man be­hav­iour”. Groups of more than five are also not al­lowed. But he said that cus­tomers have been un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>“The cus­tomer is told nicely the first time, a sec­ond time, and then the man­ager is called in,” he said, adding that the bars have not had to kick out any un­ruly cus­tomers be­cause “usu­ally by then, they leave by them­selves”.</p>
