    <p>The term mega­trends is not new. From as early as the 1970s, gov­ern­ments, econ­o­mists, so­ci­ol­o­gists and in­vestors have been try­ing to seek out and iden­tify trans­for­ma­tive forces that can re­shape so­ci­eties and economies.</p>
    <p>In the sim­plest terms, the aim is to pre­pare for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mega­trends in the 1980s were as­so­ci­ated with ris­ing in­comes and con­sumerism. Ja­panese firms like Sony, Pana­sonic and Toyota rode this wave. In the 1990s, it was about mo­bile phones and re­mote com­mu­ni­ca­tions. In the 2000s, in­vest­ments in re­source gi­ants like Rio Tinto and oth­ers be­came big as China en­tered the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion. And in the 2010s, it has been about the smart­phone as it sup­ported the growth of com­pa­nies like Face­book, Alibaba and Ten­cent.</p>
    <p>But the cy­cle of mega­trends has ac­cel­er­ated and in­ten­si­fied over the past five decades.</p>
    <p>As UBS noted, it took air­lines 68 years to build a “user base” of 50 mil­lion peo­ple. It took 14 years for com­put­ers to reach 50 mil­lion users. And it took barely a year for WeChat to reach 50 mil­lion users.</p>
    <p>The abil­ity to iden­tify the po­ten­tial for struc­tural change and in­vest in the ex­pected trans­for­ma­tions can deliver huge payoffs, not just for com­pa­nies but also in­di­vid­ual in­vestors.</p>
    <p>As Mr Kelvin Tay, re­gional chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer at UBS Global Wealth Man­age­ment, pointed out, in­vest­ing in mega­trends is a long-term ven­ture: “The­matic in­vest­ments en­able in­vestors to ac­cess fun­da­men­tal, struc­tural shifts caused by long-term global trends that trans­form the world.</p>
    <p>“Many of th­ese changes are driven by ad­vances never be­fore ex­pe­ri­enced by mankind.”</p>
    <p>So what are the mega­trends of to­day? In broad terms, they would be dis­rup­tive tech­nolo­gies, health­care and age­ing pop­u­la­tions, ur­ban­i­sa­tion, eco-sus­tain­abil­ity and food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>TECH­NOL­OGY</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy prob­a­bly leads the list, not least be­cause it can im­pact all the other mega­trends.</p>
    <p>The shut­downs, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and other dis­rup­tions wrought by the Covid-19 pan­demic have forced in­di­vid­u­als, so­ci­eties, busi­nesses and cor­po­ra­tions to lean in­creas­ingly on tech­nol­ogy for ev­ery­thing from busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plan­ning and tele­con­fer­enc­ing to shop­ping and en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>This will be a per­ma­nent fea­ture in life and will get more strongly em­bed­ded in so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, tech stocks have be­come star per­form­ers in bourses world­wide, out­pac­ing tra­di­tional cycli­cal and value shares by a wide mar­gin. This will con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Although ques­tions have been raised about their val­u­a­tions, Mr Vasu Menon, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of in­vest­ment strat­egy at OCBC Bank, reck­ons evolv­ing mega­trends will keep tech in play.</p>
    <p>“If you are tak­ing a multi-year view with your in­vest­ments, tech­nol­ogy is some­thing you can­not ig­nore be­cause it is a game changer,” he noted.</p>
    <p>But Mr Menon warns that this is also a very volatile seg­ment of the mar­ket: “Per­haps the best way to in­vest in this sec­tor is by dol­lar cost av­er­ag­ing through a reg­u­lar in­vest­ment plan, in­stead of try­ing to time the mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“But you need the stom­ach for wide swings in stock prices ... and to man­age over­all port­fo­lio risk by mak­ing sure that you do not over-in­vest in the sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>HEALTH­CARE</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has ba­si­cally laid bare the med­i­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties of so­ci­eties. Be­yond the huge surge in govern­ment-led health­care spend­ing, in­vestors have re­acted by rush­ing to in­vest in com­pa­nies sup­ply­ing gloves, masks, per­sonal pro­tec­tive gear, var­i­ous de­vices and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals.</p>
    <p>Given that this is not the first, and won’t be the last, pan­demic to hit, in­vest­ment in th­ese ar­eas is un­likely to sub­side any time soon.</p>
    <p>But be­yond the race for a vac­cine, the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try has also been pour­ing re­sources into tack­ling other ill­nesses, es­pe­cially those af­flict­ing a rapidly age­ing global pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>One area see­ing much ac­tiv­ity in­volves ther­a­pies that use genes and cells to treat dis­eases rang­ing from Alzheimer’s to di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Ge­netic ther­a­pies that can cure chronic dis­eases would rev­o­lu­tionise health­care and im­prove pa­tient out­comes while also re­duc­ing the cost of man­ag­ing th­ese pa­tients. The com­mer­cial roll-out of such treat­ments could be a game changer that would richly re­ward the win­ners.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy con­verges into health­care in the arena of healthtech. The use of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, data an­a­lyt­ics and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion will raise the ef­fi­ciency of health­care de­liv­ery, re­duce costs and im­prove telemedici­ne, aged care and di­ag­nos­tics. Also, 5G tech­nol­ogy could have a sig­nif­i­cant role in ro­bot-as­sisted surgery.</p>
    <p>UR­BAN­I­SA­TION</p>
    <p>With 50 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion now liv­ing in ur­ban ar­eas, the growth of megac­i­ties raises chal­lenges rang­ing from hous­ing to smart mobility.</p>
    <p>The search for smart mobility en­com­passes ev­ery­thing from self-driv­ing ve­hi­cles to driv­e­trains pow­ered by re­new­able en­ergy. The ur­ban gig econ­omy will also see a greater move­ment to­wards shared mobility and new-age hous­ing which ful­fils the de­mands of work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>SUS­TAIN­ABIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change and sus­tain­abil­ity is another ma­jor theme of the times, not just in ur­ban plan­ning, but also for the world as a whole. Rapid pop­u­la­tion growth and ur­ban­i­sa­tion, cou­pled with rapid degra­da­tion of na­ture, is putting pres­sure on re­sources, rang­ing from en­ergy to wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Given that 18 of the hottest years on earth oc­curred dur­ing the past 20 years, there is an im­per­a­tive to find in­no­va­tive al­ter­na­tive en­ergy sources, while also deal­ing with fu­ture chal­lenges in ar­eas such as wa­ter and re­source scarcity.</p>
    <p>Black­rock, for one, is iden­ti­fy­ing in­no­va­tors who pro­vide so­lu­tions to cli­mate change, in­clud­ing pro­duc­ers of so­lar pan­els, wind tur­bines and elec­tric ve­hi­cle tech­nolo­gies. Iden­ti­fy­ing firms at the lead­ing edge in pro­vid­ing such so­lu­tions can be­come a key fea­ture of long-term in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>FOOD SE­CU­RITY</p>
    <p>The im­por­tance of food se­cu­rity and pro­tein ad­e­quacy has also been high­lighted by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­sides en­sur­ing the sta­bil­ity and qual­ity of food sup­ply, there is also a need to en­sure that sources of pro­duc­tion are read­ily avail­able.</p>
    <p>Black­rock, for ex­am­ple, sees the need for in­creased pro­duc­tiv­ity via in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in chem­i­cals and fer­tiliser com­pa­nies, ma­chin­ery pro­duc­ers, as well as new tech such as drones, pre­dic­tive weather an­a­lyt­ics and pre­ci­sion agri­cul­ture that are nec­es­sary to in­crease yield across the world.</p>
    <p>RID­ING THE TRENDS</p>
    <p>So how do you in­vest in th­ese mega­trends?</p>
    <p>Of course, you can in­vest di­rectly as has been the case of tech­nol­ogy stocks, food sup­ply chain play­ers, and even health­care and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when it comes to rid­ing broader trends like cli­mate change, en­vi­ron­men­tal man­age­ment and sus­tain­abil­ity, there are other prod­ucts avail­able. There are “green bonds”, which are get­ting in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar, and var­i­ous struc­tured prod­ucts, such as ge­netic ther­apy funds and medtech funds, be­ing de­vised by var­i­ous fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>But as UBS’ Mr Tay points out, in­vest­ing in mega­trends can be a decade-long ven­ture: “It is an in­vest­ment in the fu­ture, and not a punt on the present.”</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, there is one over­ar­ch­ing mega­trend – the rise of Asia and the Pa­cific. As PWC noted, Asia will rep­re­sent 66 per cent of the global mid­dle class – up from 28 per cent in 2009 – and 59 per cent of mid­dle-class con­sump­tion by</p>
    <p>2030, up from 23 per cent. This will have huge ram­i­fi­ca­tions for con­sump­tion, trade, re­source use, sus­tain­abil­ity and the cli­mate.</p>
    <p>But while the op­por­tu­ni­ties are enor­mous, you must be dili­gent in do­ing the nec­es­sary re­search on firms at­tempt­ing to ride th­ese mega­trends.</p>
    <p>The abil­ity to iden­tify the po­ten­tial for struc­tural change and in­vest in the ex­pected trans­for­ma­tions can deliver huge payoffs, not just for com­pa­nies but also in­di­vid­ual in­vestors.</p>
    <p>As Mr Kelvin Tay, re­gional chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer at UBS Global Wealth Man­age­ment, pointed out, in­vest­ing in mega­trends is a long-term ven­ture: “The­matic in­vest­ments en­able in­vestors to ac­cess fun­da­men­tal, struc­tural shifts caused by long-term global trends that trans­form the world.</p>
    <p>“Many of th­ese changes are driven by ad­vances never be­fore ex­pe­ri­enced by mankind.”</p>
