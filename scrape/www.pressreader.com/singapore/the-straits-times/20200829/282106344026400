    <p>Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC) has failed in its bid to add to the claims against Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh and two other de­fen­dants in a long-run­ning case it brought against its own town coun­cil­lors.</p>
    <p>But it suc­ceeded in amend­ing the claims against WP chair­man Sylvia Lim and for­mer party chief Low Thia Khi­ang, as well as the own­ers of its for­mer man­ag­ing agent.</p>
    <p>AHTC’s claims against Mr Singh and town coun­cil­lors Chua Zhi Hon and Ken­neth Foo were fo­cused on sev­eral spe­cific con­tracts, while its claims against Ms Lim, Mr Low and Ms How Weng Fan, owner of FM So­lu­tions and Ser­vices (FMSS), were fo­cused on breaches of fidu­ciary duty.</p>
    <p>In an ap­pli­ca­tion heard ear­lier this month, AHTC had sought claims against them for breaches of a duty to ex­er­cise due skill and care to­wards the town coun­cil in re­la­tion to the con­tract awarded to FMSS and pay­ments made to the firm.</p>
    <p>In an oral judg­ment re­leased by High Court Judge Kan­nan Ramesh on Aug 20 and which was posted by Mr Singh on his Face­book page, the judge said the amend­ments per­tain­ing to Mr Singh, Mr Chua and Mr Foo in­volved is­sues that were not dealt with dur­ing the trial.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing this cat­e­gory of amend­ments would re­sult in the in­tro­duc­tion of new claims which the three de­fen­dants had not had a chance to ad­dress, he added, not­ing that judg­ment had been made in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>In the case of Ms Lim, Mr Low and Ms How, how­ever, he said the amend­ments did not do more than make clear the real con­tro­versy be­tween them and the town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>He there­fore al­lowed the amend­ments, as the is­sues raised had been ad­dressed in the orig­i­nal judg­ment and did not amount to giv­ing AHTC “a sec­ond bite of the cherry”.</p>
    <p>The bid to amend the claims is the lat­est devel­op­ment in the court case, which is now be­fore the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ramesh’s judg­ment last Oc­to­ber had cov­ered the lawsuit brought by AHTC, as well as a par­al­lel lawsuit brought by Pasir RisPung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC) against the same de­fen­dants.</p>
    <p>Th­ese two law­suits had been tried to­gether, but were not con­sol­i­dated.</p>
    <p>Not­ing this, Jus­tice Ramesh said that while the claims made by both town coun­cils arose from “a largely com­mon bedrock of facts”, the cases of the two town coun­cils dif­fered in sev­eral ma­te­rial ways, with PRPTC’s claims be­ing broader in scope. Some of the re­liefs al­lowed in the Oc­to­ber j udg­ment there­fore ap­plied only to PRPTC, not AHTC.</p>
    <p>In seek­ing the changes, AHTC had said it would bring its claims in line with those of PRPTC.</p>
    <p>It said that since the breaches against PRPTC, which re­late to the then Pung­gol East con­stituency, are premised on the breaches against AHTC, the “ends of jus­tice will not be served” if AHTC is not able to re­cover its loss when PRPTC is able to do so.</p>
    <p>Pung­gol East was man­aged by the WP-run town coun­cil from 2013 to 2015, but came un­der PRPTC af­ter the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party won the con­stituency in the 2015 Gen­eral Election. It has been split up fol­low­ing changes to elec­toral bound­aries and parts of it are now in Sengkang GRC.</p>
    <p>In 2017, AHTC, rep­re­sented by an in­de­pen­dent panel, took the town coun­cil­lors to court over $33 mil­lion in im­proper pay­ments that the town coun­cil had made un­der their watch. PRPTC soon fol­lowed with a par­al­lel lawsuit.</p>
    <p>AHTC had also said that since the amended claims are in line with PRPTC’s claims, the changes would not prej­u­dice the de­fen­dants, who had am­ple op­por­tu­nity to deal with the is­sues dur­ing trial.</p>
    <p>It added that the un­der­ly­ing facts on which the amend­ments are based had also been ad­dressed dur­ing the trial.</p>
    <p>But Jus­tice Ramesh said that since the two law­suits had not been con­sol­i­dated, they were treated as sep­a­rate pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is that the pro­posed amend­ments raise new is­sues, which were not ad­dressed by the judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Among the points the judge made is that even if he had al­lowed all the pro­posed amend­ments by AHTC, it does not mean the town coun­cil would be en­ti­tled to the re­liefs that PRPTC had been awarded in the Oc­to­ber judg­ment.</p>
    <p>“Notably, AHTC has not of­fered an ex­pla­na­tion... as to why it did not at the out­set align its plead­ings with PRPTC’s, and why the ap­pli­ca­tion has been brought so late in the day,” he said.</p>
    <p>He or­dered the par­ties to file sub­mis­sions on costs within one week of the judg­ment.</p>
