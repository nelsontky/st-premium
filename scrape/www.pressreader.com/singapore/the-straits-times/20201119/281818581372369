    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralian wine ex­porters should be pre­par­ing for their peak sell­ing sea­son, the months pre­ced­ing Christ­mas and New Year cel­e­bra­tions in China.</p>
    <p>They are in­stead watch­ing prod­uct pile up in ware­houses as its big­gest mar­ket clamps down on ship­ments from the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Al­ready on edge after China an­nounced two trade probes into the coun­try’s wine in­dus­try ear­lier this year, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion said this month that Bei­jing had also or­dered traders to stop pur­chas­ing at least seven cat­e­gories of Aus­tralian com­modi­ties – in­clud­ing wine, rock lob­sters and copper ore – in its most sweep­ing trade move against Can­berra yet.</p>
    <p>The prospect of in­def­i­nite bans would be a worst case sce­nario for Aus­tralian ex­porters, who have al­ready been hit by Covid-19 lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The is­sue wor­ries Syd­ney ex­porter Alex Xu who sells his own brands of wine from vine­yards lo­cated in South Aus­tralia’s Coon­awarra, McLaren Vale and Barossa wine re­gions. About 80 per cent of his clients are in China.</p>
    <p>Lately, his com­pany Royal Star Wine has had six or seven or­ders from China can­celled, re­sult­ing in a fi­nan­cial hit of A$200,000 (S$196,000) to A$300,000. The im­porters had been re­cently or­dered not to buy Aus­tralian wine, he said. By whom, it was un­clear.</p>
    <p>“This is a very se­ri­ous mat­ter be­cause we don’t know how long we’ll be banned,” said Chi­ne­se­born Aus­tralian Mr Xu. The or­ders not can­celled are be­ing de­layed at China cus­toms, and he cur­rently has more than 20,000 bot­tles wait­ing to clear cus­toms in China.</p>
    <p>China has not of­fi­cially con­firmed whether the bans are a gov­ern­ment di­rec­tive. Still, a spokesman for China’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs said on Tues­day that Aus­tralia is to blame for sour­ing re­la­tions, list­ing com­plaints against Can­berra for in­ter­fer­ing in mat­ters re­lated to Hong Kong, Xin­jiang and Tai­wan, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The wine trade to China ap­pears to have ef­fec­tively stopped, ac­cord­ing to Mr Tony Batta­g­lene, chief ex­ec­u­tive of in­dus­try group Aus­tralian Grape and Wine.</p>
    <p>About 40 per cent of Aus­tralian wine ex­ports would typ­i­cally be shipped in the fi­nal four months of the year, he said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s agri­cul­ture sec­tor is watch­ing the sit­u­a­tion closely, with in­dus­try ship­ments to China com­pris­ing about A$16 bil­lion in 2018-19.</p>
    <p>China is the big­gest buyer of Aus­tralian wine, im­port­ing A$1.2 bil­lion in the year through Septem­ber, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment mar­ket­ing body Wine Aus­tralia. That was 167 per cent more than the value of ex­ports to its next big­gest mar­ket, the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu had hoped that trade in the lead-up to Chi­nese New Year and Christ­mas would make up for pan­demic-re­lated trade dis­rup­tions ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>He is not sure his busi­ness will make it be­yond three or four months if things con­tinue as they are, and has re­cently in­vested in a Syd­ney child­care cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the trade is­sue, we have to put our in­vest­ment into a dif­fer­ent bas­ket,” he said.</p>
