    <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will con­vene a rare congress of the rul­ing party early next month, where he will seek to rally public sup­port and out­line new long-term eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal goals in the face of un­prece­dented chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim chaired a polit­buro meet­ing on Tues­day to pre­pare for the congress, state me­dia re­ported, with­out spec­i­fy­ing an ex­act date for its start.</p>
    <p>As 2020 ends, Mr Kim is faced with com­pound­ing crises caused by in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions, nat­u­ral dis­as­ters and a self-im­posed bor­der lockdown aimed at pre­vent­ing a coro­n­avirus outbreak.</p>
    <p>While North Korea’s nu­clear arse­nal has grown, Mr Kim’s high­stakes per­sonal out­reach to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ended with no sanc­tions re­lief, and the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has said it will not ease sanc­tions with­out more con­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>With Mr Bi­den’s pol­icy to­wards North Korea still in flux, Mr Kim is more likely to use the congress to fo­cus on do­mes­tic is­sues, par­tic­u­larly the ail­ing econ­omy and North Korea’s “juche” ide­ol­ogy of self-reliance, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>North Korea ex­pert Duyeon Kim, from the US-based Cen­tre for a New Amer­i­can Se­cu­rity, said: “Juche is truly be­ing tested for the first time be­cause the pan­demic has forced North Korea into self­iso­la­tion, when un­til now, it has been able to rely on China as a life sup­port even dur­ing the harsh­est of eco­nomic times.”</p>
    <p>North Korea has not re­ported any coro­n­avirus cases, but the econ­omy took a fur­ther hit when the coun­try closed its bor­ders to nearly all traf­fic, send­ing pub­licly re­ported trade with China tum­bling by 75 per cent.</p>
    <p>The cir­cum­stances now are de­cid­edly dif­fer­ent from the last party congress in 2016, when Mr Kim un­veiled the first five-year eco­nomic plan since 1980. With few op­tions for solv­ing the spi­ralling prob­lems, Mr Kim’s govern­ment may roll back some eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal re­forms al­lowed in the ear­lier years, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent re­searcher Rachel Miny­oung Lee, a for­mer open­source North Korea an­a­lyst for the US govern­ment, said: “North Korea’s po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic poli­cies may be­come more con­ser­va­tive, given the pro­longed dif­fi­cul­ties and the like­li­hood of their con­tin­u­a­tion into 2021, and con­se­quently the regime’s per­ceived need to re­in­force control to en­sure na­tional sta­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has im­posed for­eign ex­change con­trols on diplo­mats and cracked down on cur­rency traders, and mar­kets have been more closely tied to cen­tres of po­lit­i­cal author­ity, said NK Pro, a web­site that tracks North Korea.</p>
    <p>In a speech in Oc­to­ber, Mr Kim apol­o­gised for fail­ing to de­liver on his eco­nomic prom­ises, but also struck a de­fi­ant tone, vow­ing to crack down on of­fi­cials ac­cused of cor­rup­tion or of fail­ing the peo­ple, as well as dou­bling down on his pro­gramme of ex­pand­ing the nu­clear de­ter­rent.</p>
