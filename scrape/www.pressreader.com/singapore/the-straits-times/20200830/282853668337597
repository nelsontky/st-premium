    <p>The call came on Aug 18 at 1.45 pm, a lit­tle be­fore Mr Narayana Sukla was about to set­tle for lunch.</p>
    <p>He heard a girl sob on the line. “Please res­cue me im­me­di­ately or they will kill me,” the 12-year-old told him.</p>
    <p>“My mother has forced me to get mar­ried but I want to study,” she pleaded, us­ing her 19-year-old hus­band’s phone on the sly.</p>
    <p>A co­or­di­na­tor for Childline In­dia Foun­da­tion, which man­ages a govern­ment-sup­ported na­tional helpline for chil­dren in dis­tress, Mr Sukla knew he had no time to lose.</p>
    <p>He called up con­cerned govern­ment of­fi­cers and promptly left his of­fice in Cut­tack in the state of Odisha.</p>
    <p>Born to poor and il­lit­er­ate par­ents, the girl had been mar­ried on Aug 12 and was sex­u­ally as­saulted by her hus­band.</p>
    <p>Mr Sukla reached the girl’s in­laws’ house in Dan­da­padi, a re­mote vil­lage in the dis­trict, af­ter trav­el­ling for nearly five hours.</p>
    <p>She was res­cued that night – the family showed no re­sis­tance as Mr Sukla was ac­com­pa­nied by lo­cal po­lice – and sub­se­quently placed in a govern­ment-sup­ported shel­ter.</p>
    <p>It was one of the 13 child mar­riage cases Mr Sukla has had to in­ter­vene in since March 20 this year.</p>
    <p>“We are get­ting more cases of child mar­riage since the lock­down,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has prompted a spike in child mar­riages across In­dia, as strug­gling fam­i­lies, many ren­dered j ob­less and pushed fur­ther back into poverty, re­sort to mar­ry­ing off their girls to re­duce their fi­nan­cial bur­den.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dis­tricts have re­ported an in­crease in child mar­riage at­tempts with many other cases sus­pected to have gone unreported.</p>
    <p>Dr S. Diwakar, dis­trict child pro­tec­tion of­fi­cer for My­suru in Kar­nataka, said his dis­trict re­ported 123 in­stances be­tween mid-March and July, com­pared to around 75 for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Of the re­cent cases, 110 were stopped by the au­thor­i­ties. In­dia went into a na­tion­wide lock­down on March 25, with grad­ual re­lax­ation of mea­sures from early June.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the lock­down, many fam­i­lies at­tempted to marry off their girls think­ing govern­ment of­fices would be shut with only emer­gency ser­vices run­ning,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And now, fam­i­lies are con­duct­ing mar­riages very early in the morn­ing or at mid­night at tem­ples ex­pect­ing not to be caught,” said Dr Diwakar.</p>
    <p>Some fam­i­lies have also ex­ploited the eco­nomic down­turn to con­duct low-cost wed­dings.</p>
    <p>Tamil Nadu’s Tiru­van­na­malai dis­trict too recorded an in­crease in child mar­riage at­tempts. In June, the dis­trict re­ported 35 such in­stances, a new monthly peak since Jan­uary 2017.</p>
    <p>Be­tween April and July this year, Tiru­van­na­malai recorded 83 child mar­riage cases, com­pared with 67 in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Christina T. Dor­thy, the dis­trict’s so­cial wel­fare of­fi­cer, told The Sun­day Times all the 83 cases were stopped by the au­thor­i­ties. “Covid has given a shel­ter to mask these mar­riages.</p>
    <p>“It is an un­der-the-blan­ket kind of a thing,” she said, adding that the au­thor­i­ties in­ter­vened in some cases to find wed­dings about to be con­ducted with no ar­range­ments such as pan­dals (a fab­ric shel­ter) or even the pres­ence of guests.</p>
    <p>Data from Childline In­dia Foun­da­tion in­di­cates its rep­re­sen­ta­tives had to in­ter­vene in 14,775 cases of pre­ven­tion of child mar­riages be­tween Jan­uary and July this year.</p>
    <p>While in­ter­ven­tions in the same pe­riod last year were higher at 17,181, child-mar­riage pre­ven­tion cases in the non-lock­down months this year were up by around 17 to 21 per cent com­pared with those last year. This in­cludes the months of June and July, which saw the lock­down be­ing re­laxed pro­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>This trend of an in­crease in child mar­riages has been ex­ac­er­bated with schools re­main­ing shut since March. Many poor fam­i­lies re­lied on govern­ment schools to keep their chil­dren en­gaged as well as fed through mid-day meals that were served there.</p>
    <p>With­out this source of sus­te­nance, fam­i­lies are now be­ing forced to send their sons out to work and try to get their daugh­ters mar­ried off.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery out-of-school girl is a po­ten­tial child bride,” Ms Ananya Chakrabort­i, the chair­man of the West Ben­gal Com­mis­sion for Pro­tec­tion of Child Rights (WBCPCR), said, adding that in­creased poverty and job­less­ness have made such girls more vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>“It’s like a one-less-mouth-tofeed kind of thing,” she added.</p>
    <p>The WBCPCR launched a ded­i­cated helpline for child mar­riages in June as con­cerns for young girls stuck in their homes mounted amid the pan­demic, and es­pe­cially af­ter cy­clone Am­phan which caused wide­spread dam­age and fa­tal­i­ties in the re­gion af­ter mak­ing land­fall on May 20.</p>
    <p>The helpline had re­ceived re­ports of 41 child mar­riages up to Aug 19, of which nearly 90 per cent were stopped by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>De­spite con­sid­er­able progress, child mar­riage re­mains en­demic in In­dia, a coun­try that ac­counts for one out of ev­ery three child brides in the world. Ac­cord­ing to 2019 data from Unicef, 102 mil­lion of the 223 mil­lion child brides in In­dia were mar­ried be­fore they turned 15.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent govern­ment data from 2015-16 states that 27 per cent of In­dian women were mar­ried be­fore the le­gal age of 18, while 20 per cent of men were mar­ried be­fore the le­gal age of 21.</p>
    <p>In Ma­ha­rash­tra, child mar­riages have been fuelled by a de­mand for labour amid a bumper sug­ar­cane har­vest.</p>
    <p>“Many con­trac­tors are of­fer­ing bet­ter rates for a pair of work­ers,” said Mr San­tosh Shinde, a child rights ac­tivist and former mem­ber of Ma­ha­rash­tra’s State Com­mis­sion for Pro­tec­tion of Child Rights. The rates can vary be­tween 150,000 and 300,000 ru­pees (S$2,785 and S$5,570) for around an eight­month work­ing stint in the field.</p>
    <p>Many poor fam­i­lies are us­ing this op­por­tu­nity to send their daugh­ters along with boys from other fam­i­lies for this ex­tended pe­riod for work af­ter get­ting them mar­ried.</p>
    <p>RUSH­ING INTO MAR­RIAGE</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the lock­down, many fam­i­lies at­tempted to marry off their girls think­ing govern­ment of­fices would be shut with only emer­gency ser­vices run­ning. And now, fam­i­lies are con­duct­ing mar­riages very early in the morn­ing or at mid­night at tem­ples ex­pect­ing not to be caught.</p>

    <p>PO­TEN­TIAL BRIDE</p>
    <p>Ev­ery out-of-school girl is a po­ten­tial child bride. It’s like a one-less-mouthto-feed kind of thing. ’’</p>
    <p>MS ANANYA CHAKRABORT­I, chair­man of the West Ben­gal Com­mis­sion for Pro­tec­tion of Child Rights.</p>
    <p>’TIME BOMB’ AT HOME</p>
    <p>He added that more than 200 at­tempted cases of child mar­riage were re­ported be­tween March and June in the state. Nearly 95 per cent of these unions were, how­ever, averted with help from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is con­sid­er­ing rais­ing the min­i­mum age for women to be legally wed and bring it on a par with that for men, which is 21.</p>
    <p>While wel­com­ing this as a move that will bring gen­der par­ity, Dr Kriti Bharti, the man­ag­ing trustee of Saarthi Trust, which works to pre­vent as well as an­nul child mar­riages, said it will not re­duce in­stances of child mar­riage.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple can­not wait un­til their girls are 18 to get them mar­ried. Why will they wait un­til 21?” she said.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists say re­duc­ing child mar­riages re­quires stronger law en­force­ment and fur­ther aware­ness, in­clud­ing on the harm it does to chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Child mar­riages are known to lead to in­stances of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence and even hu­man traf­fick­ing, be­sides re­sult­ing in mal­nour­ished moth­ers and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“If there is a growing teenage girl sit­ting at home in the ru­ral and semi-ur­ban belt in In­dia, peo­ple still think of her as a time bomb,” said Ms Sudeshna Roy, a spe­cial con­sul­tant to WBCPCR.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are scared, peo­ple just want to get rid of her in some way or the other,” she said, adding that this at­ti­tude is grad­u­ally chang­ing with bet­ter aware­ness that has led to in­creased re­port­ing of child mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Be­sides chil­dren in­volved i n these mar­riages, such as the girl men­tioned at the be­gin­ning of this story, in­for­ma­tion about these wed­dings is of­ten leaked to the au­thor­i­ties and ac­tivists by other chil­dren as well as lo­cals in the area.</p>
    <p>The Pro­hi­bi­tion of Child Mar­riage Act pre­scribes pun­ish­ment for “solem­nis­ing” as well as “pro­mot­ing or per­mit­ting solem­ni­sa­tion of child mar­riages” but the num­ber of cases filed and con­vic­tion rates re­main poor.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to lat­est avail­able coun­try­wide crime data from 2018, only 501 in­ci­dents were recorded by the po­lice un­der this Act that year.</p>
    <p>Of these, 368 cases were sent for trial and only two cases re­sulted in con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also adopt a le­nient ap­proach in cases where they in­ter­vene be­fore a mar­riage is solem­nised.</p>
    <p>On such oc­ca­sions, fam­i­lies are let off with a writ­ten un­der­tak­ing stat­ing they will not at­tempt child mar­riage again. Fol­low-up care is un­der­taken to en­sure the chil­dren are not mar­ried fol­low­ing that but ac­tivists say some wed­dings still go ahead in greater se­crecy de­spite this mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies have to be pros­e­cuted for even at­tempted child mar­riages to set a de­ter­rent, ac­cord­ing to Dr Bharti.</p>
    <p>“The child mar­riage is aborted only be­cause so­cial ac­tivists or alert au­thor­i­ties show up. When peo­ple are booked for at­tempt to mur­der or rape, why not book for at­tempted child mar­riage?” she said.</p>
    <p>If there is a growing teenage girl sit­ting at home in the ru­ral and semi-ur­ban belt in In­dia, peo­ple still think of her as a time bomb. Peo­ple are scared, peo­ple just want to get rid of her in some way or the other.</p>
