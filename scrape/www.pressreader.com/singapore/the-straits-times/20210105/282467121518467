    <p>HUESCA (Spain) • Barcelona won 1-0 at bot­tom side Huesca on Sun­day as Lionel Messi be­came the first non-Span­ish player to make 500 ap­pear­ances in La Liga.</p>
    <p>The cap­tain re­turned af­ter miss­ing the fi­nal game of last year with an an­kle knock with aplomb, swing­ing in a cross for Frenkie de Jong to di­vert home for the only goal on 27 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The Cata­lans kick-started a po­ten­tially sea­son-defin­ing run of four con­sec­u­tive away matches with a vic­tory that was more com­fort­able than the score­line sug­gested, but they re­main in fifth place, 10 points be­hind lead­ers Atletico Madrid (38) and hav­ing played a game more.</p>
    <p>“In gen­eral, aside from the last 20 min­utes, we played well,” said coach Ron­ald Koe­man. “We cre­ated a lot of dan­ger, which isn’t easy against a team that shuts up at the back. We got a great goal, and we had two or three more chances to pull away.”</p>
    <p>Barca dom­i­nated pos­ses­sion and cre­ated a num­ber of chances but Huesca goal­keeper Al­varo Fer­nan­dez pro­duced sev­eral fine saves to keep the hosts in touch.</p>
    <p>Af­ter de Jong’s opener, Messi was de­nied a sec­ond just be­fore half-time when Fer­nan­dez su­perbly clawed away his free kick head­ing to­wards the top cor­ner.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gentina for­ward was again thwarted by the legs of the goal­keeper in the sec­ond half af­ter com­bin­ing well with Pedri, mo­ments af­ter Marc-An­dre ter Ste­gen re­acted sharply to keep out</p>
    <p>Rafa Mir’s in­ven­tive back-heel.</p>
    <p>That was a rare threat from Huesca who have won just once in 17 tries this sea­son but had taken points off most vis­i­tors to their Es­ta­dio El Al­co­raz, in­clud­ing Atletico in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“We came out strong and very con­cen­trated. It’s the main base we need. If we have that, we im­prove a lot with the ball and if we get bet­ter in front of goal, then we can have a very good start to the year,” added Koe­man.</p>
    <p>But it will be tough for Barca to reel in Atletico, who con­tinue to set the pace with a 2-1 vic­tory at Alaves thanks to goals from Mar­cos Llorente and Luis Suarez.</p>
    <p>The hosts had de­fender Vic­tor Laguardia sent off.</p>
    <p>Diego Sime­one’s men re­stored their two-point ad­van­tage over Real Madrid and have two games in hand on their city ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“We knew it would be a dif­fi­cult game as Alaves al­ways make things tough and they proved that by draw­ing level with one player less but it was so im­por­tant for us to get the win,” said Llorente.</p>
