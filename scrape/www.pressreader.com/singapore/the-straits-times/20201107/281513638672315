    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) re­leased yes­ter­day a range of sec­ondary school en­try scores for pupils tak­ing the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) un­der the new scor­ing sys­tem next year.</p>
    <p>The in­dica­tive cut-off scores, based on last year’s Pri­mary 6 data, will help guide pupils in their school choices and in­di­cate which schools are pos­si­bly within their reach.</p>
    <p>Schools fall broadly into three cat­e­gories: gov­ern­ment and gov­ern­ment-aided, au­tonomous and in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>This year’s Pri­mary 5 co­hort will be graded next year us­ing the new PSLE scor­ing sys­tem, which was first an­nounced in 2016.</p>
    <p>It will as­sess them on the ba­sis of their in­di­vid­ual per­for­mance in sub­jects, re­gard­less of how their peers have done.</p>
    <p>Pupils will be given achieve­ment lev­els – AL 1 to AL 8 – for each sub­ject, in­stead of grades like A* to E. A pupil’s to­tal PSLE score will be the sum of the ALs of the four sub­jects. The best score one can get is four, if the grade is AL 1 for all four sub­jects.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual brief­ing yes­ter­day, MOE said it gen­er­ated the in­dica­tive AL cut-off point ranges for dif­fer­ent school types based on the PSLE re­sults and school choice pat­terns of pupils last year.</p>
    <p>The in­dica­tive AL cut-offs for in­di­vid­ual sec­ondary schools will be re­leased in the first half of next year, based on the re­sults and school choices of this year’s PSLE co­hort.</p>
    <p>For now, the MOE said the score ranges by school types are meant to pro­vide a broad sense of sec­ondary schools’ cut-off points and help con­tex­tu­alise the end-of­school ex­am­i­na­tion re­sults for this year’s Pri­mary 5 pupils, who will soon re­ceive their grades in the new AL for­mat this year.</p>
    <p>There are 135 gov­ern­ment and gov­ern­ment-aided schools, 28 of which are au­tonomous schools, like An­der­son Sec­ondary School, Cres­cent Girls’ School and Vic­to­ria School. There are eight in­de­pen­dent schools, and these in­clude Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion and Nanyang Girls’ High School.</p>
    <p>For au­tonomous schools, the in­dica­tive cut-off point range for the Ex­press (In­te­grated Pro­gramme) course is seven to nine, while for in­de­pen­dent schools, the range is six to eight.</p>
    <p>For gov­ern­ment and gov­ern­ment-aided schools, the cut-off point ranges from eight to 22 for the Ex­press (O level) track, 22 to 25 for Nor­mal (Aca­demic), and 26 to 30 for Nor­mal (Tech­ni­cal).</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to the cur­rent T-score sys­tem, these cut-off points could vary from year to year.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary schools af­fil­i­ated to pri­mary schools will con­tinue to have two sets of cut-off points next year for af­fil­i­ated and non-af­fil­i­ated pupils. Those ad­mit­ted through Di­rect School Ad­mis­sion are also not in­cluded in the cal­cu­la­tion of cut­off points, as is the case now.</p>
    <p>MOE also gave an up­date yes­ter­day on the cri­te­ria needed for Sec­ondary 1 Nor­mal (Aca­demic) and Nor­mal (Tech­ni­cal) stu­dents to take sub­jects like English lan­guage or math­e­mat­ics at a higher level, which is now also pos­si­ble un­der sub­ject-based band­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new PSLE scor­ing sys­tem, this will be de­cided by the stu­dents’ AL score for that par­tic­u­lar sub­ject. For in­stance, if they at­tain AL 5 or bet­ter in a Stan­dard-level sub­ject at PSLE, they will be el­i­gi­ble to take the sub­ject at the Ex­press level in Sec­ondary 1.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Siew Hoong, di­rec­tor­gen­eral of ed­u­ca­tion at MOE, en­cour­aged par­ents and stu­dents to se­lect schools based on over­all learn­ing needs, in­stead of vy­ing for those they per­ceive to be most pop­u­lar. “It is about their over­all tal­ent and in­ter­est, dis­tance from home, the fit for the child,” he said.</p>
    <p>The in­dica­tive cut-off points have also shown that one may not need to get a per­fect AL score of four to get into pop­u­lar schools, con­trary to what some par­ents thought when the new scor­ing sys­tem was first an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also stressed that stu­dents and par­ents do not need to rush to short­list schools. “From Pri­mary 5 to Pri­mary 6, there is still one year of po­ten­tial growth pos­si­ble, and stu­dents will grow.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The PSLE is an im­por­tant mile­stone... It will in­vari­ably cause some anx­i­ety be­cause we are hu­man. But we hope that our Pri­mary 5 stu­dents and their par­ents will con­tinue to en­joy learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“That is the most im­por­tant.”</p>
