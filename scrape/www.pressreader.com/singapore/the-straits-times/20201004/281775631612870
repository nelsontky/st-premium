    <p>As a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing women gets un­der way, one area that is ripe for dis­cus­sion is to look at ways to ban­ish once and for all what is called locker room talk.</p>
    <p>De­spite the name, it tends to hap­pen any­where guys are alone to­gether. Dis­cus­sion is usu­ally fo­cused on women’s ap­pear­ances, and marked by lan­guage that is frowned upon in po­lite com­pany.</p>
    <p>The re­view, an­nounced last month by Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam, was sparked in part by in­ci­dents of voyeurism on cam­puses.</p>
    <p>It is part of ef­forts to in­stil gen­der equal­ity as a fun­da­men­tal value in­ter­nalised by boys and girls from a young age, among other things.</p>
    <p>Such an ex­er­cise may be in­com­plete with­out an ex­am­i­na­tion of so­cially ac­cept­able be­hav­iour be­tween men and women, in­clud­ing coarse com­ments on women’s looks that, i n ef­fect, ob­jec­tify women and ar­guably lead to harm­ful be­hav­iours like sex­ual as­sault.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing com­ments that are sex­ual and vul­gar clearly has no place in to­day’s so­ci­ety. But what about com­pli­ments about women’s looks?</p>
    <p>Can ap­par­ently in­nocu­ous com­ments be mis­in­ter­preted, po­ten­tially caus­ing em­bar­rass­ment, or even be con­sid­ered ha­rass­ment? Where should the line be drawn?</p>
    <p>Men and women ap­pre­ci­ate be­ing on the re­ceiv­ing end of com­pli­ments if they are given sin­cerely and with good in­ten­tions. It is when such a com­ment crosses the line into ob­jec­ti­fi­ca­tion that it be­comes a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>In some con­texts, even seem­ingly harm­less re­marks could come across as ob­jec­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tion­ship coun­sel­lor and clin­i­cal sex­ol­o­gist Martha Tara Lee, who sees clients for is­sues such as dif­fi­cul­ties in their sex life, said it was not un­com­mon for her to re­ceive in­quiries f rom po­ten­tial clients who sub­se­quently make com­ments like “you’re very at­trac­tive, by the way”.</p>
    <p>This un­in­vited and un­der­handed way of pay­ing com­pli­ments, she said, has “made me feel put in place as a woman or re­duced to an ob­ject, as if the pur­pose of my ex­ist­ing was to please and serve”.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee added that it was “prob­a­bly safest” not to com­pli­ment a woman on her looks at work – and cer­tainly not parts of her body or weight.</p>
    <p>So, what com­pli­ments are more likely to be viewed pos­i­tively?</p>
    <p>“It might be ac­cept­able to com­pli­ment the out­fit some­one is wear­ing, their cloth­ing ac­ces­sories or shoes if you know the per­son well enough, and if the re­mark will not be mis­taken for ha­rass­ment,” said Dr Lee.</p>
    <p>TV pre­sen­ter, model and ra­dio DJ Hanli Hoe­fer said there is no need to com­pli­ment a woman on her ap­pear­ance in the work­place. As for what set­tings make such re­marks ac­cept­able, sit­u­a­tional aware­ness is needed, she added. For in­stance, the lan­guage used on dates can­not be the same as that used in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor of Lin­guis­tics and Mul­tilin­gual Stud­ies Ivan Panovic said when it comes to what counts as a com­pli­ment, the main cri­te­rion is the “at­trib­uted un­der­ly­ing in­ten­tion”. In other words, it is not so much what the per­son pay­ing the com­pli­ment thinks or in­tends, but how the per­son be­ing com­pli­mented will in­ter­pret what is said.</p>
    <p>Prof Panovic, who teaches at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, said there are many com­po­nents that in­flu­ence how one’s words will be in­ter­preted, from the set­ting of the in­ter­ac­tion to the speaker’s re­la­tion­ship and sta­tus, in­to­na­tion, ac­com­pa­ny­ing ges­tures and looks.</p>
    <p>He said: “A man should tread care­fully when com­ment­ing on a woman’s ap­pear­ance, es­pe­cially if she is some­one he doesn’t know well or if the sit­u­a­tion or na­ture of their re­la­tion­ship makes it more ap­pro­pri­ate for him to com­pli­ment her on her abil­ity, per­son­al­ity or per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>The sin­cer­ity of the com­pli­ments also mat­ters, said Ms Vi­o­let Lim, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of dat­ing agency Lunch Ac­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>“Com­pli­ments should be gen­uine and not utilised for ul­te­rior mo­tives such as get­ting some­thing in re­turn or to curry favour with the boss.”</p>
    <p>When it comes to locker room talk, even if it is in pri­vate and among close friends, sim­i­lar rules should be fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>Men are more “vis­ual” and it is com­mon for them to talk to friends about women they find at­trac­tive, but it would be harm­ful if they start to view women as ob­jects, said Ms Lim. “Say­ing ‘yes, that woman is gor­geous’ is ad­mi­ra­tion. But ob­jec­ti­fi­ca­tion would be say­ing ‘what I would do to her…’”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim’s ad­vice to men?</p>
    <p>“Treat ev­ery­one the way you would want to be treated.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, men should treat all women with the same re­spect they would give their mother, sis­ter or daugh­ter, she said.</p>
    <p>“If you hear your male friends ob­jec­ti­fy­ing women, call them out on it,” she added.</p>
    <p>Some­times, locker room talk es­capes the con­fines of pri­vate, ma­le­only spa­ces and makes its way into the pub­lic sphere, said Stu­dents for a Safer NUS – a stu­dent group at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The group’s spokesman cited the in­ci­dent in­volv­ing the OkLet­sGo pod­cast in June, when its pro­duc­ers apol­o­gised after be­ing called out – in­clud­ing by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob – for sex­ist and lewd re­marks they made on their show.</p>
    <p>In such cases, the spokesman added, the women be­ing dis­cussed might feel “help­less or de­hu­man­ised” be­cause they are be­ing ob­jec­ti­fied in a sug­ges­tive and de­mean­ing man­ner. They also have no way of re­spond­ing to the re­marks as they were not in­cluded in the dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>Prof Panovic said men en­gage in this sort of talk in the course of male bond­ing, but that is no ex­cuse for misog­yny. “Rather, it is symp­to­matic of a cul­ture in which boys and young men are so­cialised to be­lieve that build­ing trust, friend­ships and fra­ter­nal re­la­tion­ships should en­tail de­grad­ing com­ments about women.”</p>
    <p>For that to change, what is needed is the kind of deep mind­set change Mr Shan­mugam talked about, Prof Panovic added.</p>
    <p>“And that will take time and ef­fort.”</p>
