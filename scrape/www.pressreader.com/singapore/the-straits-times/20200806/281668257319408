    <p>The Pop­u­lar book­store at Jurong Point has been added to the list of pub­lic places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health’s (MOH) up­date yes­ter­day, the book­store was vis­ited by at least one Covid-19 case from 12.05pm to 2.30pm on July 26.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides this list of lo­ca­tions that Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for more than 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>The full list can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>There were 908 new coron­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, one of the high­est num­ber of daily cases recorded since cases ex­ceeded 1,000 in April.</p>
    <p>Among these, 903 were mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries who were among the fi­nal batch of work­ers be­ing cleared of the coron­avirus, MOH said.</p>
    <p>They came from dor­mi­to­ries with a rel­a­tively high preva­lence of Covid-19 and were tested when they were al­ready in iso­la­tion or in quar­an­tine. Many were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>MOH added that all dor­mi­to­ries should be cleared by to­mor­row, with the ex­cep­tion of a few blocks in dor­mi­to­ries that serve as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties. These cur­rently house about 9,700 work­ers in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect the daily case counts to be high for the com­ing days, be­fore ta­per­ing down there­after as the in­ter-agency task force com­pletes the dor­mi­tory clear­ance,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing five cases were four im­ported pa­tients and a case in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>MOH had said ear­lier yes­ter­day that there were four cases in the com­mu­nity, but three were re-clas­si­fied af­ter con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>The sole com­mu­nity case was a 26-year-old Bangladesh­i work per­mit holder who was picked up as a re­sult of the min­istry’s proac­tive screen­ing of those work­ing in es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>He is asymp­to­matic and is cur­rently un­linked to known cases.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther tests showed that he is no longer in­fec­tious and was likely to have been in­fected in the past.</p>
    <p>All four im­ported cases ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on July 22 and were al­ready serv­ing manda­tory stay-home no­tices at dedicated fa­cil­i­ties when they were tested.</p>
    <p>Three are de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers – aged one, four and six. The last is a short-term visit pass holder, aged 63, whose ap­pli­ca­tion to en­ter Sin­ga­pore was ap­proved as she is an el­derly woman whose fam­ily are Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents, MOH said.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily com­mu­nity cases dur­ing a week has de­creased from four cases two weeks ago to two in the past week. The av­er­age num­ber of un­linked com­mu­nity cases per day has fallen from two to one over the same pe­riod.</p>
