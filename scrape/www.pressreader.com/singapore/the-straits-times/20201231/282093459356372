    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Bri­tish law­mak­ers have ap­proved Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s post-Brexit trade deal with the Euro­pean Union, as both sides looked to be­gin a new chap­ter of re­la­tions just days be­fore their di­vorce be­comes a re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and the EU signed the deal yes­ter­day and the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment will fi­nalise its im­ple­men­ta­tion, end­ing over four years of ne­go­ti­a­tions and safe­guard­ing nearly US$1 tril­lion (S$1.3 tril­lion) of an­nual trade.</p>
    <p>Both sides said it was a chance to be­gin a new chap­ter in a re­la­tion­ship forged as Europe re­built after World War II, but which has of­ten seen Bri­tain as a re­luc­tant par­tic­i­pant in ever-tighter po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, in a spe­cially con­vened sit­ting of Par­lia­ment, said he hoped to work “hand in glove” with the EU when its in­ter­ests aligned, us­ing Bri­tain’s new-found sovereignt­y to re­shape the Bri­tish econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Brexit is not an end but a be­gin­ning,” he said. “The re­spon­si­bil­ity now rests with all of us to make the best use of the pow­ers that we re­gain, the tools that we’ve taken back into our hands.”</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment’s Lower House voted 521 to 73 in favour of the deal. The Up­per House of Par­lia­ment de­bated the Bill and it should be­come law around mid­night lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>The deal has been crit­i­cised on sev­eral fronts since it was agreed on Dec 24.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion Labour Party says it is too thin and does not pro­tect trade in ser­vices, fish­er­men rage that Mr John­son has sold out their in­ter­ests, and North­ern Ire­land’s sta­tus re­mains sub­ject to much un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure to en­dorse the deal would have risked the re­turn of costly tar­iffs on trade and se­vere dis­rup­tion to sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment re­moves Bri­tain from the con­straints of EU com­pe­ti­tion and state aid laws, mean­ing it can choose to in­vest and boost in­dus­tries wher­ever it likes, Mr John­son said.</p>
    <p>It also gives Bri­tain control over its fish­ing wa­ters, im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy and law­mak­ing, and pro­vides “cer­tainty” to air­lines and haulers that have been hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, he added.</p>
    <p>The Scot­tish Na­tional Party has at­tacked the agree­ment, say­ing it would harm Scot­land’s fish­ing in­dus­try, and told Mr John­son it would bol­ster the case for in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>For­mer prime min­is­ter Theresa May, who re­signed in July last year after fail­ing to se­cure par­lia­men­tary back­ing for her Brexit plans, also wel­comed the deal.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she said she was dis­ap­pointed at the lack of pro­vi­sion for the ser­vice sec­tor, which makes up 80 per cent of Bri­tain’s econ­omy, and the City of Lon­don fi­nan­cial district.</p>
    <p>“We have a deal in trade which ben­e­fits the EU, but not one in ser­vices that would have ben­e­fited the UK,” Mrs May said.</p>
    <p>She high­lighted the extra bu­reau­cracy pro­fes­sion­als will face when try­ing to sell their ser­vices in the bloc.</p>
    <p>For Eng­land’s fish­er­men, the Brexit trade deal is a be­trayal be­cause it al­lows some EU boats con­tin­ued ac­cess to Bri­tain’s rich in­shore coastal wa­ters.</p>
    <p>In New­lyn, an an­cient Cor­nish fish­ing port, there is anger that Mr</p>
    <p>John­son has let EU boats con­tinue ply­ing the rich six to 12 nau­ti­cal mile in­shore fish­ing zone.</p>
    <p>“Boris the be­trayer has slayed us and we won’t for­get,” Mr Phil Mitchell, the 51-year-old skip­per of the 23m Govenek of Ladram, told Reuters. “We had the op­por­tu­nity to ac­tu­ally take back control and we’ve passed it up.”</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing for­eign ves­sels from the six to 12 mile limit was a “red line” for fish­er­men as the coastal area is con­sid­ered a nurs­ery, both for fish and for fish­er­men learn­ing the trade.</p>
    <p>After both sides have signed, the deal will be in place un­til the end of Fe­bru­ary, pend­ing fi­nal ap­proval by the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment to make it per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT SER­VICE SEC­TOR?</p>
    <p>We have a deal in trade which ben­e­fits the EU, but not one in ser­vices that would have ben­e­fited the UK.</p>
    <p>FOR­MER PRIME MIN­IS­TER THERESA MAY, who wel­comed the deal but was dis­ap­pointed at the lack of pro­vi­sion for the ser­vice sec­tor, which makes up 80 per cent of Bri­tain’s econ­omy.</p>
