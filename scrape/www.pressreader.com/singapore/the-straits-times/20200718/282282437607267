    <p>It is heart­en­ing to read that more than 10,000 projects have tapped En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) schemes in their growth and trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts over the first half of this year (10k projects tap En­ter­prise S’pore schemes in first half of 2020, July 15).</p>
    <p>Amid global sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions and the con­tin­u­ing rav­ages of Covid-19, the busi­ness land­scape has changed dras­ti­cally. Many in­dus­tries are up­ended and many more com­pa­nies will go un­der.</p>
    <p>It will never be busi­ness as usual again.</p>
    <p>It is not all doom and gloom.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that sur­vive should re-eval­u­ate their strat­egy and busi­ness model in the new post-Covid-19 era. They have to trans­form not only to sur­vive, but also to cre­ate a new com­pet­i­tive edge in the new land­scape ac­cel­er­ated by dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and new tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>There is no bet­ter time for lo­cal com­pa­nies to tap ESG’s Pro­duc­tiv­ity So­lu­tions Grant (PSG), which helps com­pa­nies to adopt in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions to dig­i­talise and up­grade pro­duc­tiv­ity, and En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant (EDG), which helps com­pa­nies to grow and trans­form with new ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ex­pand mar­kets overseas.</p>
    <p>Al­though com­pa­nies should be con­serv­ing cash dur­ing this pan­demic, growth cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture should be pur­sued to ex­pand the busi­ness and gen­er­ate more cash flow in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The PSG and EDG would sig­nif­i­cantly im­prove the pay­back based on any re­turn on in­vest­ment met­ric and dis­counted cash flow anal­y­sis, and en­hance value cre­ation to the com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>If promis­ing busi­nesses are cur­rently strug­gling with cash flow in their op­er­a­tions, they should tap the Gov­ern­ment’s var­i­ous schemes to tide over the dif­fi­cult pe­riod, in­clud­ing the En­ter­prise Fi­nanc­ing Scheme and the Tem­po­rary Bridg­ing Loan Pro­gramme, while em­bark­ing on the trans­for­ma­tion jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Cash flow is the life­line of any busi­ness. Al­though the Gov­ern­ment has come up with var­i­ous tem­po­rary re­lief mea­sures to help busi­nesses cope with short-term cash flow prob­lems, these mea­sures would ex­pire by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses should se­ri­ously start their cash flow plan­ning to en­sure they have a strong head start once the pan­demic ends.</p>
    <p>In busi­ness, noth­ing beats hop­ing for the best while plan­ning for the worst.</p>
