    <p>Nalati, which opened in April just af­ter the start of the cir­cuit breaker, sticks out like a sore thumb among the eater­ies cater­ing to the busi­ness crowd in Raf­fles Place.</p>
    <p>In­stead of pitch­ing it­self as a place for a quick lunch, its menu is more akin to that of a family restau­rant.</p>
    <p>That would have been an odd de­ci­sion pre­vi­ously, but with most Shen­tonites work­ing from home these days, such al­ter­na­tive think­ing may be the way to go. Traf­fic here is rel­a­tively light, there is am­ple park­ing and the Raf­fles Place MRT sta­tion is right in front.</p>
    <p>Nalati, which is part of the Distrii Sin­ga­pore co-work­ing space, started with a sim­ple homey Chi­nese menu for take­away and de­liv­ery. But it now fo­cuses on din­ing-in with an ex­panded se­lec­tion of pop­u­lar zichar of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>Look closer be­tween sta­ples like crispy shrimp paste chicken wing and steamed mar­ble goby and you find some un­ex­pected Western items like Im­pos­si­ble Welling­ton with truf­fle mash.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans may be known for their eclec­tic palates but the idea of hav­ing mine­strone soup with fo­cac­cia bread be­fore dig­ging into a plate of chilli crab and man­tou is still pretty novel.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for the “ro­jak” vibe is that the own­ers en­vis­age this as a place where a family of older folk can en­joy Chi­nese dishes they are fa­mil­iar with, while the younger ones go for mac & cheese or squid ink pasta. And every­one can share a grilled meat or seafood plat­ter, be­cause who does not like a bar­be­cue.</p>
    <p>The kitchen pulls off the twin con­cept pretty well too, whip­ping up dishes from op­po­site sides of the globe with equal flair. And guests get to en­joy the best of both worlds.</p>
