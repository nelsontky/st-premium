    <p>Two men who were orig­i­nally handed 51/ years’ jail for ex­tract</p>
    <p>2 ing more than $2 mil­lion in bribes from a flour dis­trib­u­tor had their jail term cut yes­ter­day fol­low­ing their ap­peal to the High Court.</p>
    <p>Kat­su­toshi Ishibe, 55, and Takaaki Ma­sui, 57, were each sen­tenced to three years, seven months and three weeks’ jail, as well as a fine of $200,944.</p>
    <p>The two Ja­panese men were also each or­dered to pay a penalty of more than $1 mil­lion, a sum equal to the amount of bribes they had re­ceived.</p>
    <p>They will have to serve an ad­di­tional one year’s jail if they can­not pay the fine and the penalty.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn said in his 199-page judg­ment that this was “one of the most egre­gious cases of purely pri­vate-sec­tor cor­rup­tion in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he de­ter­mined that the orig­i­nal sen­tences were man­i­festly ex­ces­sive, af­ter he set out a sen­tenc­ing frame­work for cases of cor­rup­tion in­volv­ing pri­vate-sec­tor agents per­form­ing purely com­mer­cial func­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, the of­fence car­ries a fine of up to $100,000 or jail of up to five years, or both.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan, who has pre­vi­ously is­sued sen­tenc­ing frame­works with the help of graphs, gave a pre­sen­ta­tion in court for nearly two hours, us­ing con­cep­tual di­a­grams and 3D mod­els to ex­plain his method­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>His frame­work in­volved a mod­i­fied ver­sion of the typ­i­cal ma­trix set­ting out nine sen­tenc­ing ranges de­pend­ing on three lev­els of harm and three lev­els of cul­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Un­like the tra­di­tional nine-grid box, his ma­trix in­cluded a “to­wards in­fin­ity” sec­tion to ac­count for ex­treme lev­els of harm and cul­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In his j udg­ment, Jus­tice Chan noted that the cur­rent case fell within a cat­e­gory of cases for which there are few avail­able prece­dents.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing the pair in 2018, a dis­trict judge adopted a sen­tenc­ing frame­work that set out four bands of start­ing point sen­tences based on the num­ber of of­fence­spe­cific fac­tors.</p>
    <p>Ma­sui and Ishibe were each con­victed of 28 charges of cor­rup­tion for ob­tain­ing bribes from Sin­ga­porean Koh Pee Chi­ang be­tween 2004 and 2007.</p>
    <p>The pair were sec­onded to work for the Sin­ga­pore sub­sidiary of trad­ing firm Nis­sho Iwai Corporatio­n. Fol­low­ing a merger in 2004, the sub­sidiary was re­named So­jitz Asia, where Ma­sui was gen­eral man­ager and Ishibe was man­ager.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh was the sole pro­pri­etor of Chia Lee & Co, a long­stand­ing dis­trib­u­tor of ed­i­ble flour for the duo’s em­ployer.</p>
    <p>In 2002, the duo told Mr Koh to en­ter the in­dus­trial flour busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The pair de­vised a profit-shar­ing ar­range­ment per­tain­ing to the in­dus­trial flour busi­ness to ex­tract bribes from Mr Koh in re­turn for them con­tin­u­ing to “sup­port and pro­tect” his ed­i­ble flour busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh was al­lowed to keep US$3 (S$4.02) per tonne of in­dus­trial flour while the re­main­ing US$20 was split be­tween Ma­sui and Ishibe. Over the years, Mr Koh’s share re­mained con­stant, even though prof­its in­creased to as much as US$60 per tonne.</p>
    <p>When he voiced con­cerns about the scheme, the duo threat­ened to with­draw their sup­port and pro­tec­tion for his ed­i­ble flour busi­ness.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, Mr Koh felt he had no choice but to con­tinue pay­ing the two men.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the verdict, Ma­sui’s lawyer, Mr Ni­co­las Tang, sought one week’s time for the duo to con­sider whether they wished to re­fer the case to the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Ishibe’s lawyer, Mr Sunil Sud­heesan, said Mr Tang will take over should the mat­ter go fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan said the duo have to start serv­ing their jail terms next Thurs­day if they do not file the court pa­pers by next Wed­nes­day.</p>
