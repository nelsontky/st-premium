    <p>Aero­space gi­ant Pratt & Whit­ney laid off around 400 staff at five of its six fa­cil­i­ties here yes­ter­day amid the pan­demic-in­duced down­turn in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The lay­offs com­prise 20 per cent of its lo­cal work­force. This in­cludes more than 140 work­ers in main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul firm Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia, a joint ven­ture with SIA En­gi­neer­ing, who will be re­trenched, as re­ported last week.</p>
    <p>Pratt & Whit­ney em­ploys over 2,000 work­ers here with an av­er­age em­ploy­ment ten­ure of 14 years. It noted that Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents will still form about 77 per cent of its work­force af­ter the re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can com­pany, which has been op­er­at­ing here for around 37 years, worked with the Sin­ga­pore In­dus­trial and Ser­vices Em­ploy­ees’ Union (SISEU) and the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) on cost-cut­ting steps to pro­tect jobs since April.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­cluded tem­po­rary salary re­duc­tions and shorter work weeks, can­cel­la­tion of merit in­creases, hir­ing freezes and dis­cre­tionary spend­ing cuts.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ment was “taken as a last re­sort”, the firm said in a joint state­ment with the union. Those af­fected in­cluded tech­ni­cians, en­gi­neers and man­agers.</p>
    <p>The avi­a­tion in­dus­try has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pan­demic, with global air travel crip­pled by bor­der closures and air­lines scrap­ping plane or­ders. Aero­space firms, in­clud­ing com­po­nent man­u­fac­tur­ers and main­te­nance fa­cil­i­ties, are slash­ing costs and cut­ting man­power due to de­clin­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>It has been fore­cast that it could take un­til 2024 at the ear­li­est for com­mer­cial avi­a­tion traf­fic to re­cover to pre-Covid-19 lev­els, forc­ing “this dif­fi­cult but nec­es­sary de­ci­sion”, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The SISEU was no­ti­fied early last month of the job cuts at the Pratt & Whit­ney fa­cil­i­ties it rep­re­sents – Tur­bine Over­haul Ser­vices, Pratt & Whit­ney Com­po­nent So­lu­tions, P&W NGPF Man­u­fac­tur­ing Com­pany Sin­ga­pore and Com­po­nent Aero­space Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>SISEU ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Sylvia Choo said the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise was not an overnight de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the pro­longed re­cov­ery time­line, she ex­plained that it would be tough to hold on to the ex­ist­ing man­power pool and press on with the cost-cut­ting mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“There must be some de­ci­sion at a cer­tain point,” said Ms Choo. “We (had to) as­cer­tain that there is ex­cess man­power, and the man­power can­not be re­de­ployed.”</p>
    <p>The union went through sev­eral rounds of dis­cus­sions with the com­pany to re­duce the num­ber of work­ers on the name list and en­sure that the Sin­ga­pore core is kept.</p>
    <p>Both par­ties said they will en­sure af­fected em­ploy­ees are ac­corded fair treat­ment and com­pen­sa­tion pack­ages. The pack­age in­cludes one month of pay for each year of ser­vice, capped at 25 years.</p>
    <p>The union’s im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity is to work with the com­pany to give af­fected em­ploy­ees the nec­es­sary as­sis­tance, in­clud­ing up­grad­ing their skills. It will li­aise with NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute to ar­range for work­ers to at­tend job fairs and work­shops.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the re­trench­ment pack­ages, SISEU has asked Pratt & Whit­ney to of­fer laid-off staff a one-off train­ing grant to up­date their skills.</p>
    <p>Re­trenched em­ploy­ees who are union mem­bers will also re­ceive paid NTUC mem­ber­ship un­til the end of the year so they can get ben­e­fits such as bur­sary awards, in­sur­ance coverage, per­sonal de­vel­op­ment and train­ing as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Work­ers said they were in­formed of the re­trench­ments last week but were not told who was on the list.</p>
    <p>Tool cal­i­bra­tion tech­ni­cian Ridzuan Ab­dul Hamid, 53, was let go af­ter 30 years with the firm – a de­ci­sion he said he was men­tally pre­pared for.</p>
    <p>“Of course, I feel sad, I have worked here for 30 years. There are a lot of mem­o­ries. But I un­der­stand the com­pany is re­siz­ing be­cause the pan­demic has af­fected it.”</p>
