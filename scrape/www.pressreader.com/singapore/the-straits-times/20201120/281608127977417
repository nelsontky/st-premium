    <p>With peo­ple forced to stay at home to stem the spread of the coro­n­avirus, con­sumers turned to on­line shop­ping and dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies to keep in touch with fam­ily. As a re­sult, busi­nesses have had to speed up dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and in­no­va­tion, and this could al­ter the way busi­ness is con­ducted, said the task force.</p>
    <p>In de­vis­ing eco­nomic strate­gies for a post-Covid world, the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force is work­ing on the premise that there will be no re­turn to the old nor­mal, even af­ter the health cri­sis re­cedes.</p>
    <p>To this end, the task force has iden­ti­fied six shifts from which op­por­tu­ni­ties could emerge, said Min­is­ter for Na­tional Devel­op­ment Desmond Lee and PSA In­ter­na­tional group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tan Chong Meng, its co-chairs. These six key shifts that are re­shap­ing the econ­omy have been ac­cel­er­ated by the health cri­sis, they added.</p>
    <p>• One shift is a change in the global or­der. As the di­rec­tion for geopol­i­tics shifts to­wards Asia, in­tra-re­gional trade flows could grow, said the task force.</p>
    <p>• The pandemic has also laid bare the draw­backs of sup­ply chains pur­su­ing ef­fi­ciency at the cost of re­silience, as com­pa­nies and coun­tries found them­selves with­out buf­fers to over­come dis­rup­tions on a global scale. This could lead to a re­bal­anc­ing be­tween “ef­fi­ciency” and “re­silience” in sup­ply chains, which may re­sult in shorter sup­ply chains with pro­duc­tion bases lo­cated closer to con­sumer markets, and stock­pil­ing of es­sen­tial ma­te­ri­als for pro­duc­tion, said the task force. • With peo­ple forced to stay at home to stem the spread of the coro­n­avirus, con­sumers turned to on­line shop­ping and dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies to keep in touch with fam­ily. As a re­sult, busi­nesses have had to speed up dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and in­no­va­tion, and this could al­ter the way busi­ness is con­ducted, said the task force.</p>
    <p>• An­other shift is in con­sumer pref­er­ences, which have not re­turned to pre-pandemic norms. The task force said de­mand for e-com­merce, e-ser­vices and dig­i­tal chan­nels will in­crease, and there will be a grow­ing em­pha­sis on ser­vices that af­fect in­di­vid­ual</p>
    <p>health and well­ness.</p>
    <p>• Covid-19 has also brought an in­creased fo­cus on en­vi­ron­men­tal, eco­nomic and social sus­tain­abil­ity, which could re­sult in new busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties such as in the green econ­omy.</p>
    <p>• With sig­nif­i­cant pres­sure on busi­nesses, in­dus­try con­sol­i­da­tion and churn will also ac­cel­er­ate. The task force said large pri­vate com­pa­nies will re­in­force their mar­ket dom­i­nance, and those with avail­able cap­i­tal can ac­quire dis­tressed as­sets, lead­ing to in­dus­try con­sol­i­da­tion. There may also be more cau­tion in in­vest­ments due to higher debts and greater un­cer­tainty.</p>
