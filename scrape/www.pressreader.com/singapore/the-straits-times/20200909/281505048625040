    <p>One of the hottest top­ics un­der dis­cus­sion th­ese days among econ­o­mists, in­vestors and bankers is what kind of “fla­tion” we will get over the next three years. Will it be more de­fla­tion, a rise of in­fla­tion, or a com­bi­na­tion of both, namely “stagfla­tion” (a word that com­bines eco­nomic stag­na­tion and in­fla­tion)?</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of econ­o­mists agree that de­fla­tion will con­tinue at least through next year. But be­yond that, the con­sen­sus breaks down. Some say the de­fla­tion will per­sist. Oth­ers say higher in­fla­tion will be un­avoid­able and a few sug­gest that stagfla­tion is even­tu­ally in­evitable. So it’s worth ex­plor­ing what the dif­fer­ent views are.</p>
    <p>For its part, the United States Fed­eral Re­serve, which will be one of the most in­flu­en­tial ac­tors in deter­min­ing what we will end up with, sees lit­tle prospect of in­fla­tion through 2022.</p>
    <p>Its lat­est fore­casts for in­creases in core per­sonal con­sump­tion ex­pen­di­ture – its favoured mea­sure of in­fla­tion – are 1 per cent for this year, 1.5 per cent for next year and 1.7 per cent for 2022 – all of which are below its tar­get in­fla­tion rate of 2 per cent, and sig­nals that the Fed will main­tain near-zero in­ter­est rates till at least the end of 2022 – un­less its fore­casts change.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists have pro­duced a wealth of ar­gu­ments to sup­port this prog­no­sis. With un­em­ploy­ment likely to re­main high (not only in the US, but also in most coun­tries), con­sumer de­mand will be weak, and there will lit­tle pres­sure to in­crease wages.</p>
    <p>There have also been changes in con­sumer habits – the greater adop­tion of e-com­merce, more fru­gal life­styles and higher sav­ings. On the busi­ness side, there is a lot of un­der­used ca­pac­ity – most fac­to­ries are still in­tact but many are only semi-oper­a­tional – as well as high un­cer­tainty, which points to weak in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>There has also been a soft­en­ing of oil prices. And Covid-19 will spur in­creases in au­toma­tion which will boost pro­duc­tiv­ity. Most econ­o­mists agree that all of th­ese fac­tors will limit price in­creases, at least through next year.</p>
    <p>But then what hap­pens af­ter next year, when we pass this phase?</p>
    <p>That is where the de­bate starts.</p>
    <p>THE POL­ICY IM­PACT</p>
    <p>One of the points of con­tention re­lates to the pol­icy re­sponse to Covid-19. Cen­tral banks have pumped sev­eral tril­lions of dol­lars, euro and yen into the world’s ma­jor economies. The Fed alone has un­leashed more than US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion). The chart of the growth of the US broad money sup­ply M2 has gone ver­ti­cal since the out­break, grow­ing by about 20 per cent year on year. It’s a sim­i­lar story in other ad­vanced economies.</p>
    <p>On top of that, there has been a del­uge of fis­cal spend­ing al­most ev­ery­where, and es­pe­cially in ad­vanced economies. US law­mak­ers have ap­proved more than US$3 tril­lion – or around 14 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) – in emer­gency fund­ing since March and there may be more to come. Un­like af­ter the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the bulk of this money has not gone to banks but into the broader econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The an­nual bud­get deficit is es­ti­mated at US$3.3 tril­lion this fis­cal year end­ing Sept 30, more than triple the level in the pre­vi­ous year. The to­tal pub­lic debt (the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of past and cur­rent deficits) will be close to 100 per cent of GDP, ap­proach­ing the World War II record level of 106 per cent of GDP.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of hefty tax in­creases, which are nowhere in sight, much of this debt will have to be mon­e­tised by the Fed. The re­sult­ing de­base­ment of the US dol­lar would also lead to a weak­en­ing of the cur­rency. All of this would nor­mally be in­fla­tion­ary.</p>
    <p>But the de­fla­tion­ists point out that the pro­longed un­em­ploy­ment, low wage pres­sures and the slump in con­sumer de­mand and busi­ness in­vest­ment will more than com­pen­sate for the in­fla­tion­ary ef­fects. They also note that Ja­pan has been mon­etis­ing its deficits and debts for years, and is still strug­gling against de­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund’s for­mer chief econ­o­mist Olivier Blan­chard, while main­tain­ing that de­fla­tion is like­lier, ac­knowl­edges a sce­nario where in­fla­tion could take hold. This would hap­pen if there are sub­se­quent waves of Covid-19 which lead to more and more fis­cal spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“Mul­ti­ply the ini­tial fis­cal pack­age by 2 or 3 and it leads to a large in­crease in the ra­tio of debt to GDP,” he pointed out in a blog. If the Fed con­tin­ues to keep in­ter­est rates low – whether to pre­vent an ex­plo­sion of debt ser­vic­ing costs or un­der pres­sure from a pop­ulist gov­ern­ment – the econ­omy would over­heat. In­fla­tion­ary ex­pec­ta­tions would set in, and in­fla­tion would take off. But he views this as an im­prob­a­ble sce­nario.</p>
    <p>DE-GLOB­AL­I­SA­TION AND IN­FLA­TION</p>
    <p>An­other sce­nario for in­fla­tion, cited by many econ­o­mists, in­clud­ing Dr Stephen Roach of Yale Univer­sity as well as Dr Nouriel Roubini – also known as “Dr Doom” – of New York Univer­sity, would re­sult from de-glob­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The ac­cel­er­a­tion of glob­al­i­sa­tion over the last 20 years en­cour­aged more out­sourc­ing and ef­fi­cient pro­duc­tion. For ex­am­ple, com­pa­nies sourced cheap goods from China and other emerg­ing mar­kets and main­tained small in­ven­to­ries, which re­duced costs and prices.</p>
    <p>But now this process will go into re­verse. Sup­ply chains are shift­ing out of China, in­ven­to­ries will in­crease and more pro­duc­tion is be­ing re-shored to more ex­pen­sive lo­ca­tions. Ex­port re­stric­tions are also grow­ing – as we have seen in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal, med­i­cal equip­ment and food sec­tors – and there are ris­ing pres­sures to curb mi­gra­tion, all of which would lead to higher prices and wage costs.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese shifts – par­tic­u­larly of sup­ply chains – will be per­ma­nent. So while their in­fla­tion­ary ef­fects might not ma­te­ri­alise as long as the re­ces­sion per­sists, they will emerge once re­cov­ery gets un­der way – that is, prob­a­bly by 2022.</p>
    <p>But the de­fla­tion­ists counter that the in­fla­tion­ary im­pact of sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions is ex­ag­ger­ated. First, it will not be easy for sup­ply chains to shift out of China, where they are deeply en­trenched; at best, it will be a slow process.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, many of the shifts will be to other low-cost lo­ca­tions such as South-east Asia and Mex­ico. And the re-shoring of pro­duc­tion to more ex­pen­sive places will be ac­com­pa­nied by faster au­toma­tion, which would not nec­es­sar­ily lead to higher prices.</p>
    <p>But while the jury is still out on whether more de­fla­tion or more in­fla­tion is on the cards af­ter next year, there is broad agree­ment that more in­fla­tion would be ben­e­fi­cial. A lot of the ex­ces­sive debt held by com­pa­nies, house­holds and gov­ern­ments would get de­pleted in real terms.</p>
    <p>Dr Roach sug­gests that, in fact, higher in­fla­tion may be the only way out of the debt quag­mire. That, he points out, is ex­actly how the US cut its World War II debt by more than half (from 106 per cent of GDP to 47 per cent) be­tween 1947 and 1957. He es­ti­mates that a com­pa­ra­ble debt shrink­age would oc­cur if in­fla­tion moves back to 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>There would be losers of course – mainly savers, pen­sion funds, in­sur­ance com­pa­nies and hold­ers of cash. But the econ­omy as a whole will be back on the growth path.</p>
    <p>THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS</p>
    <p>But there is also an­other pos­si­bil­ity, and that is the worst of both worlds post-2022, namely stagfla­tion, which pre­vailed in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment could re­main high if, for ex­am­ple, Covid-19 per­sists be­cause of new waves of in­fec­tions or de­lays in the de­ploy­ment of a vac­cine – which means that re­ces­sion will per­sist. At the same time, out­put could be re­stricted be­cause fac­to­ries are forced to op­er­ate below ca­pac­ity. Cou­pled with ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism and sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions, this could add to short­ages of goods, push­ing up prices. In­fla­tion would be ag­gra­vated by the con­tin­ued mon­eti­sa­tion of ever ris­ing fis­cal deficits and debts and a fall­ing US dol­lar.</p>
    <p>This gloomy sce­nario is a mi­nor­ity view among econ­o­mists – Dr Roubini is among those who sub­scribe to it – but it can­not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>Stagfla­tion would cre­ate a se­ri­ous dilemma for pol­i­cy­mak­ers, es­pe­cially cen­tral banks, which would be faced with a painful choice. Should they at­tack in­fla­tion by rais­ing in­ter­est rates and risk cre­at­ing even higher un­em­ploy­ment? Or should they tol­er­ate high in­fla­tion to save jobs and re­duce the real value of debt in the econ­omy but cre­ate other prob­lems?</p>
    <p>Mr Brian Read­ing, eco­nomic ad­viser to the late for­mer Bri­tish prime min­is­ter Ed­ward Heath – who had to deal with stagfla­tion in the early 1970s – sug­gests that pol­i­cy­mak­ers will choose the lat­ter. “Wel­come to the fu­ture,” writes Mr Read­ing, in a com­men­tary for the Of­fi­cial Mon­e­tary and Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tions Fo­rum – a think-tank where he serves on the ad­vi­sory board. “It isn’t pretty – but it’s the log­i­cal con­se­quence of what’s hap­pen­ing now.”</p>
    <p>So take your pick be­tween de­fla­tion, in­fla­tion and stagfla­tion. None of the sce­nar­ios is be­nign and any is pos­si­ble. All we know for sure is that the so-called Goldilocks econ­omy – not too hot, not too cold, with mod­er­ate growth, low un­em­ploy­ment and low in­fla­tion – is his­tory.</p>
