    <p>The M1 Sin­ga­pore Fringe</p>
    <p>Fes­ti­val re­turns this month with Quiet Riot as its theme, ex­plor­ing the idea of change from the mid­dle ground. Artistes will present works on is­sues such as cli­mate change and the cen­sor­ship of women’s writ­ing. The Straits Times takes a look at four pro­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>When the M1 Sin­ga­pore Fringe Fes­ti­val re­turns from Jan 20 to 31, Sin­ga­porean and in­ter­na­tional artistes will present works deal­ing with is­sues such as cli­mate change, blind obe­di­ence and the cen­sor­ship of women’s writ­ing.</p>
    <p>There are eight the­atre pro­duc­tions and a we­bi­nar. Shows will be staged live at the Es­planade and Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, and streamed via video-on­de­mand on Sis­tic Live.</p>
    <p>This year’s theme is Quiet Riot, which artis­tic direc­tor Alvin Tan, 57, says is a re­sponse to the po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers were in­ter­ested in the idea of chang­ing sys­tems from within and in ques­tion­ing the po­lit­i­cal ef­fi­cacy of do­ing so.</p>
    <p>“There are things like pol­i­tics with a cap­i­tal P, and cul­tural pol­i­tics like fem­i­nism, chal­leng­ing pa­tri­ar­chal mech­a­nisms and things which in Sin­ga­pore are more tol­er­a­ble – peo­ple don’t get into trou­ble for it,” Tan adds.</p>
    <p>“There’s a whole spec­trum. We thought Quiet Riot would be able to ex­plore that spec­trum rather than just grav­i­tate to­wards pol­i­tics with a cap­i­tal P.”</p>
    <p>The an­nual fes­ti­val, now in its 17th edi­tion, is or­gan­ised by the­atre com­pany The Nec­es­sary Stage and has Tan back at the helm. Sean Tobin, the former head of the­atre at the School of the Arts, led the event from 2015 to last year.</p>
    <p>Tan adds: “My hope is that we iden­tify the mid­dle ground be­cause the world is so eas­ily po­larised. Look at Amer­ica – it’s gun ver­sus anti-gun, pro-life ver­sus pro-choice, fun­da­men­tal­ist Chris­tians ver­sus LGBTQ.</p>
    <p>“Those in the mid­dle ground are not speak­ing up be­cause they don’t feel safe. When there is no mid­dle ground, it is very dif­fi­cult to ne­go­ti­ate, to have mean­ing­ful di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>“With Quiet Riot, peo­ple who are not extremists, who do not like protests, can find a space to still be­lieve in im­prov­ing so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“And maybe peo­ple who are protest­ing, who might not feel that it is fruit­ful in Sin­ga­pore, might come to the mid­dle ground to see how it can be done within the sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>This year’s fes­ti­val will also be more ac­ces­si­ble than be­fore.</p>
    <p>Some live per­for­mances will come with fea­tures such as au­dio de­scrip­tion and open cap­tion­ing. All videos on de­mand will have closed cap­tions. A quiet space – where peo­ple can re­treat to if they feel over­stim­u­lated – will be pro­vided near each per­for­mance venue.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times takes a closer look at four pro­duc­tions.</p>
