    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester City re­turned to train­ing on Wed­nes­day af­ter no new pos­i­tive Covid-19 cases were re­ported fol­low­ing the lat­est round of test­ing, in an in­di­ca­tion that Sun­day’s Premier League game at Chelsea should take place.</p>
    <p>How­ever, City said they will con­duct more tests be­fore the game to en­sure the Eti­had out­break that has re­sulted in “a num­ber of pos­i­tive cases” on top of last week’s pos­i­tive tests for Gabriel Je­sus and Kyle Walker is un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“Safety re­mains our No. 1 pri­or­ity, and the club will con­tinue to pro­ceed with great cau­tion,” a state­ment read. “The bub­ble will un­dergo fur­ther test­ing in the com­ing days, the re­sults of which will in­form and dic­tate the next steps.”</p>
    <p>The Premier League side has yet to con­firm whether Je­sus, Walker and their other un­named in­fected play­ers will be cleared to play at Stam­ford Bridge, with man­ager Pep Guardi­ola set to re­veal more details at his pre-match press con­fer­ence to­day.</p>
    <p>City’s clus­ter prompted the post­pone­ment of their top-flight game at Ever­ton on Mon­day, while another out­break at Craven Cot­tage saw Wed­nes­day’s league game be­tween Tot­ten­ham and Ful­ham get pushed back, the third fix­ture to be de­layed this sea­son fol­low­ing As­ton Villa-New­cas­tle last month.</p>
    <p>But the Premier League, as cor­rob­o­rated by Bri­tish me­dia, con­firmed it is not dis­cussing a pos­si­ble pause to the sea­son be­cause of surg­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Eng­land, pri­mar­ily linked to the United King­dom mu­tant vari­ant, which is said to be 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble than other strains.</p>
    <p>“The Premier League has not dis­cussed paus­ing the sea­son,” a state­ment read.</p>
    <p>“The league con­tin­ues to have con­fi­dence in its Covid-19 pro­to­cols to en­able fix­tures to be played as sched­uled, and these pro­to­cols con­tinue to have the full back­ing of (the Bri­tish) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“With the health of play­ers and staff the pri­or­ity, the league is also fully supportive of how clubs are im­ple­ment­ing the pro­to­cols and rules.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the spike, the English Foot­ball League (EFL), which over­sees the other three di­vi­sions, has urged lower-tier sides to ramp up test­ing to de­ter­mine if next week’s FA Cup third-round ties can take place.</p>
    <p>Un­like Premier League clubs, EFL teams are not sub­ject to manda­tory Covid-19 test­ing due to the costs in­volved – bi-weekly test­ing would cost each club ap­prox­i­mately £10,000 (S$18,000) per week, which they can­not af­ford with no match-day rev­enue.</p>
    <p>In­stead, a test is re­quired only if a player “de­vel­ops symp­toms, re­turns from an in­ter­na­tional break, or spends a long pe­riod away from the train­ing ground”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, out­breaks have led to eight lower-tier matches on Box­ing Day be­ing post­poned and a fur­ther nine to be axed on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Next Sun­day’s FA Cup tie be­tween Chelsea and More­cambe at Stam­ford Bridge is in doubt as the League Two side are strug­gling to deal with a clus­ter that has led to their last two league games be­ing pushed back. With the en­tire UK now un­der Tier 3 or 4 re­stric­tions, that also means all Premier League games will be held be­hind closed doors again mov­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool yes­ter­day was the last area to fall un­der the stricter mea­sures, end­ing the short-lived ex­per­i­ment of hav­ing 2,000 fans in sta­di­ums. Lon­don moved back to Tier 4 be­fore Christ­mas.</p>
