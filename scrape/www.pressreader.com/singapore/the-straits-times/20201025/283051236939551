    <p>You prob­a­bly want to buy some­thing. For many house­holds, there is more money at the end of the month. Spend­ing on restau­rant meals and en­ter­tain­ment is way down. Ex­cess in­come over spend­ing is about 14 per cent – up from a 25-year av­er­age of 7 per cent to 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>To be sure, on­line shopping is up. Over the last six months, in­come-se­cure house­holds have spent more on sport­ing equip­ment (up 29 per cent from last year) and beer, wine and liquor stores (up 22 per cent).</p>
    <p>But I am guess­ing as the pandemic drags on, the boom­let for gar­den­ing and home of­fice equip­ment, fur­ni­ture, pandemic pup­pies and other nest­ing items may wane.</p>
    <p>You can only buy so many kitchen gad­gets. And on­line buy­ing may be a fleet­ing re­lief from the pandemic blues.</p>
    <p>But the urge to buy some­thing doesn’t go away. So, if you’re one of the lucky peo­ple with a job, enough to eat and a place to live, what should you buy in a pandemic?</p>
    <p>First, buy a pic­ture frame. Print out a bank state­ment show­ing you saved money. Put it in the pic­ture frame. Make sav­ing the new sta­tus good – flaunt it like a golf club.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, sat­isfy shopping urges by get­ting any­thing you want at the thrift store – go wild. Much of the ex­pe­ri­ence will be like reg­u­lar shopping. You get the same thrill of the hunt. You may not use most of what you buy, but most of us wear only about 20 per cent of our clothes any­way. You might as well spend less on the clothes you don’t wear.</p>
    <p>Third, buy a book about how ad­ver­tis­ing ma­nip­u­lates peo­ple into buy­ing stuff they don’t need.</p>
    <p>Fourth, buy an hour with a fee-for-ser­vice fi­nan­cial ad­viser. A fidu­ciary, fee-only (not fee-based) fi­nan­cial ad­viser is legally bound to act in your best in­ter­est. Fee-based ad­vis­ers are not fidu­cia­ries; they re­ceive com­mis­sions from the prod­ucts they sell.</p>
    <p>A fee-only ad­viser can of­fer only prod­ucts that serve your best in­ter­est. One with a Cer­ti­fied Fi­nan­cial Plan­ner cre­den­tial has that ex­tra ed­u­ca­tion and ex­pe­ri­ence re­quire­ments to bet­ter ad­dress holis­tic fi­nan­cial needs. Robo ad­vis­ers may help those with lim­ited bud­gets.</p>
    <p>The bot­tom line is that both robot and per­son will prob­a­bly tell you the same thing: save more. Look, I know that get­ting ad­vice to save more has roughly the same ef­fect as ad­vice to eat less. The point here isn’t to pro­duce shopping-sham­ing to go along with fat-sham­ing.</p>
    <p>And I don’t mean to im­ply that a fail­ure to save is your fault. Sav­ing mis­takes are of­ten at­trib­uted to the wiring of the human brain, but only a small share of us are shopping ad­dicts. About 8 per cent of the pub­lic are patho­log­i­cal shop­pers pre­oc­cu­pied with shopping or suf­fer­ing from buyer’s re­morse.</p>
    <p>Ex­per­i­ments us­ing PET technology have linked com­pul­sive buy­ing with spe­cific In­ter­net ad­dic­tions or a pre­dis­po­si­tion to shopping-in­duced ex­citabil­ity. That means only a few of us truly lose con­trol over our spend­ing, whether be­cause we are plea­sure seek­ing, es­cap­ing neg­a­tive emo­tions or can’t self-reg­u­late.</p>
    <p>More of­ten, a fail­ure to save can be at­trib­uted to not hav­ing enough wages. If the pandemic has you, at last, in the for­tu­nate po­si­tion of hav­ing some ex­tra cash burn­ing a hole in your pocket, con­sider your­self lucky – and save up. Plan­ning for se­cu­rity is the only ra­tio­nal thing to do in the face of the con­tin­u­ing bad news. We are los­ing mo­men­tum in the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple left the work­force than were new jobs cre­ated last month. Pay in­creases are not hap­pen­ing any time soon with ris­ing per­ma­nent lay­offs. For those who re­port not hav­ing enough to eat, the is­sue is not “what” to buy, but “how”. Ori­ent your pandemic buy­ing to those things that may add to your se­cu­rity and sav­ings. Buy a cush­ion, not a crutch.</p>
