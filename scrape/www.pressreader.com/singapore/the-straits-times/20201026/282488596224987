    <p>“I don’t med­i­tate, so I look to other parts of my day to be­come med­i­ta­tive, in­clud­ing my cof­fee and break­fast rou­tine,” Ms Nina Zor­fass, 30, a New York City res­i­dent who works in mar­ket­ing, wrote in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>Her tech­nique? Eat­ing break­fast in com­plete si­lence.</p>
    <p>When she started this prac­tice eight years ago, she no­ticed that she felt more pre­pared for the day ahead and could make health­ier food choices.</p>
    <p>Now, in the midst of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, she has re­lied on that time to recharge while liv­ing and work­ing in close quar­ters with her part­ner.</p>
    <p>“Alone time is hard to come by in our apart­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>Eat­ing in si­lence is an an­cient prac­tice with roots in many monas­tic com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Bud­dhists, Celtic mys­tics, Su­fis, Vedic mys­tics,” said Ms Ginny Whol­ley, a teacher at the UMass Memo­rial Health Care Cen­tre for Mind­ful­ness. “Ev­ery­one has a com­po­nent of si­lence that is an in­her­ent part of the prac­tice.”</p>
    <p>Mind­ful­ness ex­pert Jon Ka­batZinn founded in 1979 the cen­tre where Ms Whol­ley teaches, to pro­mote and study the ben­e­fits of prac­tices like these in a sec­u­lar set­ting, in part be­cause it is chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of silent break­fast is sim­ple enough: Fo­cus on your food qui­etly and deal with what­ever thoughts come up. But it is more dif­fi­cult than it seems.</p>
    <p>I spent sev­eral days at the Kri­palu Cen­tre for Yoga and Health in Stock­bridge, Mas­sachusetts, last Oc­to­ber and silent break­fast was on the menu.</p>
    <p>Signs on ev­ery ta­ble re­minded guests that break­fast should be eaten in si­lence. Ed­u­ca­tional carousels of cards ex­tolled the virtues of re­con­nect­ing with your­self each morn­ing: It ben­e­fits your mind and body to start your day pur­pose­fully, calmly and in grat­i­tude.</p>
    <p>On the first day, I car­ried my break­fast tray down the aisle of the din­ing room, feel­ing the eyes of strangers fol­low me like some angst-rid­den school cafe­te­ria scene in movies.</p>
    <p>I passed row af­ter row of fel­low break­fasters. Some shifted in their seats as I walked by, the only sounds the cau­tious clinks of sil­ver­ware onto bowls and plates. Oc­ca­sion­ally, a chair would scrape the floor as some­one sat down or left.</p>
    <p>“Our so­ci­ety leans into com­plex­ity and dif­fi­culty be­cause then there’s more ‘value’ to it,” said Ms Cristie Ne­whart, dean of the yoga school at Kri­palu.</p>
    <p>“When you’re first learn­ing to be­come more present, it’s like, ‘Present with what? What do I do?’ In mind­ful eat­ing, you’re bring­ing all your at­ten­tion to food.”</p>
    <p>My mind re­volted half­way through my gra­nola. As a free­lance writer, I have al­ways had an un­healthy work-life bal­ance, partly from in­ter­nal­is­ing the idea that I should max­imise pro­duc­tiv­ity at all costs.</p>
    <p>My par­ents were en­tre­pre­neur­ial peo­ple who suc­cess­fully worked their way out of un­der­priv­i­leged child­hoods. They in­stilled a tough work ethic in me.</p>
    <p>“Self-care”, I be­lieved, was for peo­ple who had the time and money. Not work­ing hard enough meant risk­ing fail­ure.</p>
    <p>But here I was, at my first well­ness re­treat, try­ing to ap­pre­ci­ate a bowl of berries and tail-spin­ning into ex­is­ten­tial dread. It felt in­dul­gent and lazy to fo­cus so in­tently on my food. I had a to-do list a mile long and a new mort­gage to worry about. I was deeply un­com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>“As some­one who speaks nearly con­stantly, the idea of en­forced si­lence seemed puni­tive,” said Ms Melissa Klur­man, a j our­nal­ist in Mont­clair, New Jersey, who also</p>
    <p>Af­ter sev­eral days of silent break­fast, I started to hear my­self. My con­cerns and thoughts, happy with their time at the soap­box, stepped back and stopped plagu­ing me first thing in the morn­ing. I could fo­cus on what was in front of me, with­out guilt, with­out obli­ga­tion, with­out stress. It was an un­usual feel­ing of free­dom.</p>
    <p>tried out silent break­fast on a re­treat to Kri­palu last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Ravi Kude­sia, a mind­ful­ness re­searcher and as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Tem­ple Univer­sity’s Fox School of Business, said: “One of the funny things about start­ing a mind­ful­ness prac­tice is that when you qui­eten the ex­ter­nal noise, you start to hear more of the in­ter­nal noise.</p>
    <p>“If you’re not used to this, it can be in­cred­i­bly un­pleas­ant. The key idea here is that it’s bet­ter to no­tice the whis­pers be­fore they be­come screams.”</p>
    <p>I could not con­cen­trate, so I let my mind run wild through its litany of wor­ries and re­minders. Then, like a tod­dler wear­ing her­self out af­ter a tantrum, my thoughts qui­etened down.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sev­eral days of silent break­fast, I started to hear my­self.</p>
    <p>My con­cerns and thoughts, happy with their time at the soap­box, stepped back and stopped plagu­ing me first thing in the morn­ing. I could fo­cus on what was in front of me, with­out guilt, with­out obli­ga­tion, with­out stress. It was an un­usual feel­ing of free­dom.</p>
    <p>For Ms Deb­o­rah Vaphides, 62, an acupunc­tur­ist from Mont­clair, New Jersey, start­ing her morn­ings with a silent rou­tine sev­eral days a week helps her feel more grounded through­out the day. She sits by her win­dow and watches the sun­light stream in early in the morn­ings while prac­tis­ing deep breath­ing ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>“I used to lis­ten to the news ev­ery morn­ing for decades,” she said. “No more. I know the news will find me these days no mat­ter where I go. The im­age of the light chang­ing dur­ing my quiet morn­ings stays with me all day and I come back to that peace­ful­ness any time I need it.”</p>
    <p>This peace, it turns out, has a lot to do with our phys­i­cal re­sponse. “When we’re in si­lence, our brains and bod­ies re­act sim­i­larly to when we med­i­tate,” said clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Lau­raine Hol­lyer.</p>
    <p>“Cor­ti­sol, which is associated with stress, de­creases in the blood­stream. Blood pres­sure, breath­ing rate and heart rate also de­crease. We can con­cen­trate and re­call more eas­ily.”</p>
