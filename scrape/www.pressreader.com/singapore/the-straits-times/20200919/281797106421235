    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s new Prime Min­is­ter will pur­sue eco­nomic struc­tural re­forms through a mixed bag of poli­cies that tar­get spe­cific in­dus­tries, rather than a grand strat­egy to re­shape so­ci­ety and boost long-term growth.</p>
    <p>Armed with a strong grip on Ja­pan’s bu­reau­cracy, Mr Yoshi­hide Suga knows which levers to pull to get re­sults, say gov­ern­ment and rul­ing party of­fi­cials who know him or have worked with him.</p>
    <p>But an ini­tial need to con­sol­i­date pop­u­lar sup­port means he will first tar­get quick pol­icy wins that will later give him the po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal to pur­sue tougher re­forms, they said.</p>
    <p>“He isn’t af­ter vi­sions. He’s some­one who wants to ac­com­plish small goals one by one,” said po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst At­suo Ito, a for­mer rul­ing party staff mem­ber. “He’ll ini­tially fo­cus on prag­matic goals that di­rectly af­fect peo­ple’s liveli­hood.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has said he will con­tinue pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe’s progrowth “Abe­nomics” strat­egy aimed at pulling Ja­pan out of de­fla­tion with heavy mone­tary and fis­cal stim­u­lus cou­pled with struc­tural re­forms.</p>
    <p>But un­like Mr Abe, Mr Suga’s plans for struc­tural re­forms will fo­cus more on spurring com­pe­ti­tion, rather than deeper so­cial change.</p>
    <p>For Mr Suga, eco­nomic re­form will be a po­lit­i­cal pri­or­ity in its own right, un­like Mr Abe, whose re­forms were wrapped up i n a broader po­lit­i­cal agenda that in­cluded the thorny chal­lenge of re­vis­ing Ja­pan’s paci­fist Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga must act quickly, as his cur­rent term lasts for only a year, un­less he calls a snap elec­tion to win the public’s man­date to run a full, three-year term.</p>
    <p>That means he will first seek “quick-hit” achieve­ments that di­rectly chan­nel money to house­holds.</p>
    <p>Among the sweet­en­ers would be to slash cell­phone charges by around 40 per cent, raise the min­i­mum wage and in­crease pay­outs to cush­ion the blow from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“At this mo­ment, he has to fo­cus on very short-term is­sues like how to stim­u­late the econ­omy,” said Mr Heizo Tak­e­naka, who served in the Cab­i­net of re­formist for­mer pre­mier Ju­nichiro Koizumi.</p>
    <p>Re­mov­ing pro­tec­tions in in­dus­try will be one such ob­jec­tive, even if it riles some parts of cor­po­rate Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“In­tro­duc­ing com­pe­ti­tion among mo­bile phone car­ri­ers could be a very sym­bolic pol­icy for Suga be­cause he loves com­pe­ti­tion,” said Mr Tak­e­naka, who re­tains close con­tact with Mr Suga. “He hates peo­ple with vested in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, Mr Suga could pur­sue bolder re­forms such as lib­er­al­is­ing the heav­ily pro­tected med­i­cal sec­tor, con­sol­i­dat­ing weak re­gional banks and break­ing bar­ri­ers that ham­per com­pe­ti­tion among smal­land mid-sized firms.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing served as Mr Abe’s top spokesman, Mr Suga al­ready knows his way around Ja­pan’s mas­sive bu­reau­cracy.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga re­laxed visa re­quire­ments to boost in­bound tourism, over­com­ing push­back from the Jus­tice Min­istry. He also cut through bu­reau­cratic op­po­si­tion and ex­panded a scheme that gave tax breaks for do­na­tions to Ja­pan’s re­gional ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“Suga may not be charis­matic, but he gets things done,” said Mr Taimei Ya­m­aguchi, a rul­ing party law­maker close to Mr Suga. “Some of the best ad­vice I got from him was to make the most of the ex­per­tise the bu­reau­crats have.”</p>
    <p>Some gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials say Mr Suga’s fo­cus on dereg­u­la­tion makes his poli­cies closer to those of Mr Koizumi, who con­sol­i­dated big banks and dereg­u­lated the labour mar­ket in the early 2000s.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s slo­gan urg­ing the public to “look af­ter your­self be­fore seek­ing gov­ern­ment help” re­flects his back­ground as a self-made politi­cian who made his way up from be­ing the son of a straw­berry farmer to Ja­pan’s leader, said peo­ple who know him.</p>
    <p>“Suga’s re­forms look more like Koizumi’s,” said one of the of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“He prob­a­bly feels that it’s in­evitable for some of the small, zom­bie firms to go un­der,” an­other of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>For Mr Abe, struc­tural re­forms that sought to re­vive the econ­omy through looser re­stric­tions around im­mi­gra­tion, labour and cor­po­ra­tions re­main largely un­fin­ished busi­ness, due to strong po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion. The chal­lenge for Mr Suga would be to push through his own pain­ful re­forms just as Ja­pan strug­gles to climb out of its worst post­war slump.</p>
    <p>Bank of Ja­pan gov­er­nor Haruhiko Kuroda, who sup­ported Abe­nomics with mas­sive mone­tary stim­u­lus, is hope­ful. “It’s tough but there is now a widely ac­cepted view in Ja­pan that dereg­u­la­tion and struc­tural re­forms are nec­es­sary,” he said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally, I see a good chance dereg­u­la­tion will suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>ONE SMALL GOAL AT A TIME</p>
    <p>He isn’t af­ter vi­sions. He’s some­one who wants to ac­com­plish small goals one by one. He’ll ini­tially fo­cus on prag­matic goals that di­rectly af­fect peo­ple’s liveli­hood.</p>
    <p>MR AT­SUO ITO, a po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst and for­mer rul­ing party em­ployee, on how the “Suga­nomics” of Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga (above) might work.</p>
