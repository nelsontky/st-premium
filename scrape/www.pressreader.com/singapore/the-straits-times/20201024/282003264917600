    <p>We all suf­fer mul­ti­ple bouts of the com­mon cold through­out our lives and never think twice about it. We live with re­cur­ring in­fluenza sea­sons de­spite a vac­cine. But what about Covid-19?</p>
    <p>Re­peat oc­cur­rences of cold and flu hap­pen be­cause our im­mune sys­tems seem to “for­get” the pre­vi­ous in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Some­times, a case isn’t se­ri­ous enough for the body to de­velop an im­mune re­ac­tion and create a “mem­ory” to help fight it the next time. In other cases, the virus has changed enough such that the im­mune sys­tem does not recog­nise it and has to mount a brand new re­ac­tion. This tends to hap­pen with the flu be­cause it mu­tates a lot, and that is why vac­cines tar­get­ing a spe­cific flu strain be­come less ef­fec­tive as new ones arise.</p>
    <p>It is against this back­drop that we hear re­ports of Covid-19 pa­tients get­ting re­in­fected with the virus.</p>
    <p>In some ways, this shouldn’t be sur­pris­ing; af­ter all, Covid-19, like the com­mon cold, is caused by a coro­n­avirus. Even so, it’s a trou­bling devel­op­ment, given how much more deadly this virus is rel­a­tive to most colds and flu, es­pe­cially in older peo­ple and those with health con­di­tions such as obe­sity or di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>As it is, a wave of fresh out­breaks is caus­ing a spike in new cases world­wide, be­fore any rash of se­cond bouts.</p>
    <p>Should we be wor­ried about re­in­fec­tions?</p>
    <p>It all de­pends, like so much else in this fight, on the devel­op­ment of an ef­fec­tive vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The good news is that with such an in­oc­u­la­tion, Covid-19 will likely be less of a threat even if the virus lingers in one form or an­other. But there are un­knowns.</p>
    <p>Here’s what we do know:</p>
    <p>When it comes to Covid-19, at least as of now, re­in­fec­tions ap­pear to be very rare.</p>
    <p>Out of more than 40 mil­lion Covid-19 cases re­ported world­wide, there have been only five prop­erly doc­u­mented re­in­fec­tions. That’s a rate of 1.25 per 10 mil­lion in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Re­in­fec­tions may be­come more com­mon as time passes. This may hap­pen if our im­mune sys­tems don’t con­sis­tently mount a strong or durable re­ac­tion to the virus, as is the case for the four coro­n­aviruses that cause the com­mon cold.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, the virus could start to mu­tate suf­fi­ciently to al­low it to re­in­fect even in­di­vid­u­als whose im­mune sys­tems do have a mem­ory of it.</p>
    <p>The last sce­nario is less of a worry be­cause Sars-Cov-2 – the virus that causes Covid-19 – is one of the few viruses in its class that has a “proof-read­ing” mech­a­nism to cor­rect mu­ta­tions. While this re­duces the num­ber of mu­ta­tions to far be­low that seen with the in­fluenza virus, it does still hap­pen.</p>
    <p>What all this means is, there’s a chance that the virus caus­ing Covid-19 be­comes en­demic in the hu­man pop­u­la­tion just like flu and the com­mon cold. That, in turn, raises the un­palat­able prospect of re­cur­ring lock­downs, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>But here’s where a vac­cine comes in. We know that the virus is very good at evad­ing the hu­man im­mune sys­tem through mul­ti­ple mech­a­nisms. So an in­fec­tion is likely to lead to a sub­op­ti­mal im­mune re­sponse in most peo­ple, es­pe­cially the more vul­ner­a­ble older pop­u­la­tion which has a di­min­ished im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>An ef­fec­tive vac­cine would help the body put up a bet­ter fight against an in­fec­tion, lim­it­ing the sever­ity of any health ef­fects.</p>
    <p>More good news: Most of the Covid-19 vac­cines now in devel­op­ment tar­get the “spike pro­tein”, a part of the virus which has shown lit­tle change over time.</p>
    <p>Also, the newer types of vac­cines like those be­ing de­vel­oped by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech – which use the body’s pro­tein ma­chin­ery to prime the im­mune sys­tem – can be rapidly de­ployed to pro­duce a dif­fer­ent vac­cine if the virus mu­tates enough to evade a cur­rent ver­sion.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing one or more vac­cines make it through to ap­proval, they have a good chance not only of staving off new cases but also lim­it­ing the in­ci­dence of re­peat in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>They don’t have to work per­fectly in the most sus­cep­ti­ble peo­ple, such as the el­derly, be­cause a good im­mu­ni­sa­tion cam­paign in younger in­di­vid­u­als will create the “herd im­mu­nity” that we all keep hear­ing about.</p>
    <p>If vac­cines do not work at all – or end up not in­duc­ing a very strong or long-last­ing im­mune re­ac­tion – then we are in a very tough spot. As of now, based on lim­ited data, we can only guess at which way it will go.</p>
    <p>I re­main op­ti­mistic that we will get one or more vac­cines that can help us man­age this dis­ease, in­clud­ing re­in­fec­tions. But it’s too soon to say for sure. That’s why I say don’t worry – just yet.</p>
