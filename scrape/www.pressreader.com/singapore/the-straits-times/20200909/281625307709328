    <p>While Te­masek’s port­fo­lio re­mains an­chored in Asia, its ex­po­sure in Sin­ga­pore by un­der­ly­ing as­sets has fallen be­hind that in China for the first time, on the back of rel­a­tive valu­a­tions in the two mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic now ac­counts for about 24 per cent of its port­fo­lio, com­pared with 29 per cent ex­po­sure in China, the state in­vestor said yes­ter­day in its an­nual re­view for the fi­nan­cial year ended March 31.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, Sin­ga­pore and China each ac­counted for 26 per cent of Te­masek’s port­fo­lio the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>The firm’s deputy chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer and head of fi­nan­cial ser­vices Png Chin Yee said the ex­po­sure by un­der­ly­ing as­sets re­flects the fact that many of Te­masek’s port­fo­lio com­pa­nies which are based in Sin­ga­pore have also ex­panded be­yond the Repub­lic as part of their own plans to cap­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties abroad.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s 24 per cent ex­po­sure in Sin­ga­pore is also the low­est for its home market since its for­ma­tion in 1974. This fig­ure has been be­tween 26 per cent and 29 per cent</p>
    <p>over the past few years.</p>
    <p>In terms of where com­pa­nies are head­quar­tered, about half of Te­masek’s port­fo­lio are still based in Sin­ga­pore, she noted.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing why China has over­taken Sin­ga­pore in terms of ex­po­sure by un­der­ly­ing as­sets, Ms Png pointed to the rel­a­tive valu­a­tions in the two mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we should be sur­prised to see our ex­po­sure in­creas­ingly be­ing sort of non-Sin­ga­pore, be­cause if you com­pare the econ­omy of Sin­ga­pore ver­sus China or ver­sus the United States, for ex­am­ple, we are a smaller econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“It is quite nat­u­ral as we evolve that we will see much more ex­po­sure out of Sin­ga­pore,” she said, but reaf­firmed that Te­masek con­tin­ues to in­vest in Sin­ga­pore and sup­ports the lo­cal ecosys­tem here.</p>
    <p>Among its new in­vest­ments in China are so­cial plat­form Kuaishou Tech­nol­ogy, the Beijing-Shang­hai high-speed rail­way and oph­thalmic phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal plat­form com­pany Oc­u­men­sion Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, Te­masek backs re­wards plat­form ShopBack, as well as al­ter­na­tive meat com­pany Growth­well Group.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese cre­ate longer-term growth op­por­tu­ni­ties that com­ple­ment our ex­po­sure in ma­jor Sin­ga­pore hold­ings and ef­forts by Heli­co­nia Capital to en­able small and medium en­ter­prises to scale be­yond Sin­ga­pore,” Te­masek said.</p>
    <p>Heli­co­nia Capital is a wholly owned sub­sidiary of Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the de­vel­oped mar­kets of North Amer­ica and Europe now ac­count for 17 per cent and 10 per cent of Te­masek’s port­fo­lio, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Over­all, two-thirds of its un­der­ly­ing ex­po­sure is in Asia.</p>
    <p>Ge­o­graph­i­cally, the largest share of the firm’s new in­vest­ments dur­ing the past fis­cal year was in the United States, the same as last year, fol­lowed by China and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing to a ques­tion on its ex­po­sure to sec­tors hard­est hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic, Te­masek In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive Dil­han Pil­lay said that its ex­po­sure to the avi­a­tion, tourism and travel sec­tors is about 5 per cent of its port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of this is in Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies such as Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Mandai Park Hold­ings, he noted, and its other in­vest­ments in th­ese seg­ments are not very sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sec­tors are un­der­go­ing sig­nif­i­cant change as a re­sult of Covid-19 and this will con­tinue even af­ter the pan­demic, Mr Pil­lay said, but there is al­ways op­por­tu­nity and value in ev­ery sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing to say that th­ese are sec­tors we will not in­vest in. We will have to watch what the trends are go­ing to be like, and whether there are busi­ness mod­els which will emerge that we could ac­tu­ally go into and sup­port,” he said.</p>
