    <p>LON­DON • Arse­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta says he is ready to “take the bul­lets” for the club’s dis­mal form in the Premier League and urged his play­ers to put every­thing on the line to ar­rest their “blip”.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard has faced calls for his sack­ing af­ter Sun­day’s 1-0 home de­feat by Burn­ley con­demned Arse­nal to their poor­est start to a sea­son since 1974.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal have lost their last four home league games – their worst se­quence since 1959 – and an­other de­feat at the Emi­rates Sta­dium against Southamp­ton to­day would pile fur­ther pres­sure on Arteta.</p>
    <p>He was given a vote of con­fi­dence by Arse­nal tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor Edu on Mon­day, but ad­mit­ted he had to shoul­der the re­spon­si­bil­ity for the team’s five-match win­less run in the league.</p>
    <p>Adamant he still re­tains the back­ing of his play­ers, Arteta told re­porters yes­ter­day: “My feel­ing is yes. When I see the re­ac­tion and the way they try, there’s not one bit that wor­ries me that they’re not try­ing their best, that’s for sure.”</p>
    <p>Lan­guish­ing in 15th place af­ter seven de­feats in their first 12 league games, Arse­nal are closer to the rel­e­ga­tion zone than the top four.</p>
    <p>But Arteta is not con­cerned that Arse­nal now face an un­think­able rel­e­ga­tion bat­tle and is con­fi­dent that re­sults will turn soon.</p>
    <p>“I want to think that we are in a blip, los­ing foot­ball matches makes me be­lieve that but we need to start to win,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause just drop­ping and drop­ping down the ta­ble is not the sit­u­a­tion we want to be in. But this is our re­al­ity right now and we have to face it be­ing brave, fight­ing and no one giv­ing up or any­thing.</p>
    <p>“It’s not time to hide, it’s time to put your face and your body on the line and at the mo­ment, I’m sorry, but we have to take the bul­lets.”</p>
    <p>Arteta added that he ac­cepted that he bore “max­i­mum re­spon­si­bil­ity” for the bad re­sults.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day you have to win foot­ball matches... So my chest is here and hit me, guys.”</p>
    <p>The game to­day will be played be­hind closed doors af­ter the cap­i­tal was placed in the tough­est tier of Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal were among the 10 Premier League clubs who were al­lowed to wel­come back 2,000 fans ear­lier this month. But the Bri­tish govern­ment said on Mon­day that Lon­don was moved to Tier 3, cit­ing an ex­po­nen­tial rise in in­fec­tion rates.</p>
