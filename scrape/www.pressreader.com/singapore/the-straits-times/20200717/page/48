        C12 | FRIDAY, JULY 17 , 2020 Essentials for easy living and working Strict physical distancing measures ahead ofreopenin­gofsportsf­acilities By ARUL JOHN By JUSTIN CHUA Phase 2 of Singapore’s gradual reopening means that many of us can now use the facilities we relied on for our fitness fix. Venues such as stadiums, swimming complexes, sports halls, hard courts, gyms, fitness studios, golf courses and bowling centres, including those in condominiu­ms, golf and country clubs are among the facilities that have been allowed to receive the public once more. With this, they will have to follow strict measures announced by national sports agency Sport Singapore (SportSG). They are: • The operating capacity of these facilities is restricted to 10 sq m per person, or a maximum of 50 people per facility.
• A distance of 2 metres should be kept between individual­s engaged in exercise and sports, with those involved in high intensity or high movement exercises indoors required to be 3m apart. • Group activities are limited to no more than five participan­ts.
If there is more than one group sharing a space, the groups should not interact with each other and must be 3m apart. • Sharing of equipment such as weights and basketball­s should be avoided where possible. • OWELL BIO-MAGNETIC AIR REFLEXOLOG­Y SANDALS OWELL OSMOSE FOAM POSTURE CARE OWELL MEDICFLOW PLUS & MINI S NANO-ZINC REUSABLE FACE MASK Bad posture can cause aches and pain.
