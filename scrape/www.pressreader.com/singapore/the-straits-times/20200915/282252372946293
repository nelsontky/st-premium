    <p>For years now, those For­mula One driv­ers who had been priv­i­leged enough to test at Mugello had spo­ken in awed tones of the 5.245km cir­cuit as the Holy Grail, a won­der­ful venue coiled like a snake in the beau­ti­ful rolling hills of Tus­cany. But even Fer­rari’s own­er­ship was in­suf­fi­cient to win them an F1 grand prix. Monza had been Italy’s Cathe­dral of Speed since 1922, ex­cept when it was be­ing up­graded in 1980 and the race was switched to Imola.</p>
    <p>If it could ever re­ally be said that there is any­thing good to come from Covid-19, it is that the virus in­di­rectly led to Mugello be­ing granted a grand prix at last. New races in Europe are as rare as hen’s teeth these days as F1 con­tin­u­ally seeks wider global ex­po­sure and, co­in­ci­dence of co­in­ci­dences, it would be Fer­rari’s 1,000th race. Serendip­ity lives!</p>
    <p>Florence was thus en fete for the right­ful cel­e­bra­tion of the famed Scud­e­ria’s im­pres­sive mile­stone. They didn’t en­ter for the Bri­tish GP which in­au­gu­rated the of­fi­cial World Cham­pi­onship in 1950 be­cause Enzo Fer­rari knew his cars would be beaten by the Alfa Romeos, but Al­berto As­cari helmed a 125 F1 to sec­ond place in Monaco next time out, and the SF1000s of Charles Le­clerc and Se­bas­tian Vet­tel were spe­cially painted in its bur­gundy hue.</p>
    <p>And we had a thrilling, crazy, crash fest of a race in which Mercedes’ Lewis Hamil­ton and Valt­teri Bot­tas kept swop­ping the start­ing ad­van­tage due to the three sep­a­rate starts ne­ces­si­tated by the spec­tac­u­lar in­ci­dents. Yet again, Bot­tas lost pole po­si­tion to Hamil­ton by frac­tions of a sec­ond, but be­cause of the long run down to the first cor­ner, start­ing in front was a dis­ad­van­tage be­cause you towed ev­ery­one else in your slip­stream and were thus vul­ner­a­ble. Hence Hamil­ton lost the first start and won the sec­ond, since Bot­tas had jumped ahead un­til the first stop­page. But there­after Hamil­ton took back con­trol and is now one vic­tory short of Michael Schu­macher’s record of 91.</p>
    <p>The driv­ers loved the place, with its kilo­me­tre-long front straight, fast flow­ing cor­ners, and the awe­some sec­tion be­tween the Casanova and en­su­ing pair of right-handed Arrab­bi­ata cor­ners, all taken at more than 270kmh with vir­tu­ally no lift of the throt­tle. Spikes of 6g (g-force) un­der brak­ing are fa­mil­iar, but 5.5g in cor­ner­ing taxed their neck mus­cles to the max­i­mum.</p>
    <p>Mugello is a throw­back to a dif­fer­ent era, when rac­ing was loved purely be­cause it was rac­ing, to the days be­fore pad­dle-shift gear­boxes, haloes, stut­ter­ing slow cor­ners de­signed to show­case track­side ad­ver­tis­ing, and the end­less team-to-driver mes­sages which re­move so much of the man at the wheel’s role in cal­cu­lat­ing ex­actly what his car is do­ing.</p>
    <p>The Grand Prix of Tus­cany was thus a much-needed fil­lip for a sport crit­i­cised so much these days for a lack of over­tak­ing. Thanks to that straight, there was plenty of it on Sun­day. And ev­ery­one wants the chance to go back.</p>
    <p>For me the one mas­sive down­side was the early demise of Max Ver­stap­pen and Red Bull. All through prac­tice and qual­i­fy­ing there was that air of men­ace about the Dutch­man in the dull blue, red and yel­low car, who was ready to race its wheels off.</p>
    <p>I thought Max had a gen­uine chance of win­ning on Sun­day, and it was thus a tragedy to see him pull along­side Hamil­ton at the start only to fall be­hind and get taken out in the sec­ond cor­ner melee, after his Honda en­gine suf­fered sud­den power loss. Imag­ine if he and Hamil­ton had gone at it for the whole 59 laps, restarts and red flags not­with­stand­ing. Now that would have been a real grand prix.</p>
    <p>Mugello is a throw­back to a dif­fer­ent era, when rac­ing was loved purely be­cause it was rac­ing, to the days be­fore pad­dle-shift gear­boxes, haloes, stut­ter­ing slow cor­ners de­signed to show­case track­side ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
