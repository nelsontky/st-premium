    <p>The Galaxy Watch3 is the lat­est flag­ship smart­watch from Sam­sung.</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sor to the Galaxy Watch (there is no Watch2, but there was a cheaper Watch Ac­tive2), the Watch3 comes in two sizes, both avail­able in cel­lu­lar (LTE) and non­cel­lu­lar ver­sions.</p>
    <p>The 45mm mod­els are in sil­ver and black, while the 41mm mod­els are avail­able in sil­ver and bronze.</p>
    <p>The 41mm mod­els, which have a 1.2-inch cir­cu­lar touch­screen dis­play, are ideal for those with smaller wrists, while the 44mm mod­els have a 1.4-inch dis­play.</p>
    <p>Apart from the size dif­fer­ence, they are iden­ti­cal in de­sign.</p>
    <p>With its clas­sic time­piece de­sign, the Watch3 looks sim­i­lar to the Galaxy Watch, although the Watch3 has slim­mer lugs. It re­tains its pre­de­ces­sor’s unique ro­tat­ing bezel and the two but­tons on the watch case’s right.</p>
    <p>The re­view model – a 41mm bronze non-cel­lu­lar ver­sion – looks gor­geous, with its leather strap match­ing the colour of the bronze stain­less-steel case. It looks even bet­ter af­ter I use a match­ing ana­logue watch face to give it an all­bronze shine. Dur­ing lunch meet­ings, sev­eral ac­quain­tances mis­take it for an ana­logue watch.</p>
    <p>I have al­ways been a fan of the ro­tat­ing bezel, as it lets you nav­i­gate the smart­watch’s in­ter­face with­out block­ing the dis­play.</p>
    <p>You can eas­ily scroll through the smart­watch’s Tizen op­er­at­ing sys­tem by turn­ing the bezel. Plus, the user in­ter­face puts apps in a cir­cu­lar ar­range­ment, so you can go to the app you want quickly.</p>
    <p>When con­nected to an An­droid smart­phone, the watch’s no­ti­fi­ca­tions ap­pear as tiles that you can tap on, to read the en­tire e-mail or re­ply to mes­sages.</p>
    <p>It prob­a­bly of­fers the best smart­watch ex­pe­ri­ence out­side of the Ap­ple Watch.</p>
    <p>But it is not op­ti­mised for iOS. There are no­ti­fi­ca­tions I can­not re­ply to and e-mails that can­not be scrolled.</p>
    <p>On the health-mon­i­tor­ing front, the Watch3 has sev­eral new fea­tures, in­clud­ing one that mea­sures SpO2, or the amount of oxy­gen in your blood­stream.</p>
    <p>There is also a fea­ture that de­tects falls us­ing an ac­celerom­e­ter, sim­i­lar to the fea­ture of­fered by the Ap­ple Watch.</p>
    <p>Two other new health fea­tures of the Watch3 – elec­tro­car­dio­gram mea­sure­ment and blood pres­sure mon­i­tor – are not yet avail­able in Sin­ga­pore as they are pend­ing the au­thor­i­ties’ ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Like its pre­de­ces­sor, the Watch3 sup­ports the Sam­sung Pay con­tact­less pay­ment. This is great – I can pay for post-run drinks eas­ily with a tap of the watch.</p>
    <p>It is also wa­ter-re­sis­tant to a depth of 50m, so you can wear it all the time, and whether you are run­ning or swim­ming.</p>
    <p>While it tracks sleep, I find it a tad bulky to wear in bed. Nonethe­less, it will give you a score of your sleep qual­ity based on how much time you spend in each sleep­ing stage.</p>
    <p>It pin­points the time I go to bed and wake up, as well as notes the pe­ri­ods when I am in light or deep sleep.</p>
    <p>In terms of step track­ing, the Watch3 is re­ally ac­cu­rate. It reg­is­ters only 1.5 per cent more steps than my cal­i­brated Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4.</p>
    <p>On my usual 5km jog­ging route, the watch’s GPS func­tion tracks only 50m more than the ac­tual dis­tance.</p>
    <p>When it comes to bat­tery life, the Watch3 – when con­stantly con­nected to a Sam­sung Galaxy Note20 Ul­tra – has about 30 per cent bat­tery left at the end of two days, in which I go for a 5km GPS­tracked jog and record a night of sleep data.</p>
    <p>The Watch3 has a fairly hefty start­ing price tag of $648. This is more ex­pen­sive than the Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 5 base model ($599) as well as the Oppo Watch ($399 for the 46mm ver­sion), the lat­est Wear OS smart­watch in the market.</p>
