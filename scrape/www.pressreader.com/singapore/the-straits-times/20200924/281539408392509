    <p>Nearly 60 years af­ter the Women’s Char­ter eman­ci­pated women in Sin­ga­pore, giv­ing them equal op­por­tu­nity in school and at the work­place, it is time for gen­der equal­ity to go where it re­ally mat­ters – the home, says se­nior po­lit­i­cal cor­re­spon­dent Tham Yuen-C (be­low).</p>
    <p>On Feb 15, 1959, the seeds of gen­der equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore were sown at the fields of Hong Lim Green. The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) had kicked off a se­ries of pre-election road­shows on the windy and rainy day to ex­plain the party’s pro­grammes and poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Then party chair­man Toh Chin Chye said to peo­ple gath­ered at the field that the party stood for “equal­ity of op­por­tu­nity for ed­u­ca­tion and em­ploy­ment to all Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens”.</p>
    <p>Days later, go­ing into more de­tails about the PAP’s pol­icy state­ments, Dr Toh said the eman­ci­pa­tion of women would play an im­por­tant role in na­tion build­ing, and an­nounced that a law on monog­a­mous mar­riage would be in­tro­duced to free women from “the binds of feu­dal­ism and con­ser­vatism”.</p>
    <p>An ex­ten­sive ed­u­ca­tion cam­paign on the rights of women would also be rolled out to “free work­ing-class women from do­mes­tic drudgery”.</p>
    <p>“We shall fos­ter the prin­ci­ple, if nec­es­sary by leg­is­la­tion, that there shall be equal­ity of women with men in all spheres and we shall en­cour­age them to come for­ward to play a lead­ing role in pol­i­tics, ad­min­is­tra­tion, busi­ness and in­dus­try, ed­u­ca­tion and in other spheres,” pledged the PAP.</p>
    <p>WOMEN’S CHAR­TER AND NEW RE­VIEW</p>
    <p>These prom­ises even­tu­ally crys­tallised in the Women’s Char­ter, fi­nally passed into law in 1961, be­fore Sin­ga­pore’s in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>And then, on Sun­day, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam an­nounced a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing gen­der in­equal­ity, that can be said to be a con­tin­u­a­tion of the jour­ney started some 60 years ago.</p>
    <p>The re­view, to be led by three</p>
    <p>PAP women Mem­bers of</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment – who will con­sult widely – will cul­mi­nate in a White Pa­per to be de­liv­ered in the first half of next year. It aims to bring about a cul­tural and mind­set change on gen­der equal­ity and re­spect for women.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the ini­tia­tive, Mr Shan­mugam said re­cent in­ci­dents of voyeurism on cam­puses and de­bates on the penal­ties the per­pe­tra­tors re­ceived had set him think­ing about gen­der equal­ity. While Sin­ga­pore’s penal­ties are stiff com­pared with those in many other ju­ris­dic­tions, peo­ple had chaffed at the mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors that fac­tored into sen­tenc­ing, such as whether the per­pe­tra­tor had a bright fu­ture ahead.</p>
    <p>A more philo­soph­i­cal, fun­da­men­tal way of ap­proach­ing the prob­lem must be to seek to in­stil gen­der equal­ity as a fun­da­men­tal value, said Mr Shan­mugam. “They need to be taught from a very early age that boys and girls are to be treated equally, and, very im­por­tantly, with re­spect. It has to be a deep mind­set change.”</p>
    <p>FROM LAWS TO MIND­SETS</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the Women’s Char­ter on Sin­ga­pore in the early years was im­me­di­ate and sig­nif­i­cant. It paved the way for wives to be ac­corded full and equal rights as their hus­bands un­der the law and pro­tec­tion within mar­riage, at a time when many mar­ried men had con­cu­bines. It also cod­i­fied women’s per­sonal rights, al­low­ing them to own prop­erty and sue in their own name even if they were mar­ried.</p>
    <p>This set the foun­da­tion for women to re­ceive equal ed­u­ca­tion and work op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“At the macro level, the en­act­ment of the Women’s Char­ter may have played a piv­otal part in rais­ing the sta­tus of women and sup­port­ing their eco­nomic par­tic­i­pa­tion,” wrote National Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Emer­i­tus Pro­fes­sor of Law Leong Wai Kum in Fifty Years And More Of The Women’s Char­ter, pub­lished in the Sin­ga­pore Jour­nal of Le­gal Stud­ies in 2008.</p>
    <p>In her ar­ti­cle, she noted that in 1957, a cen­sus year, 21.6 per cent of the to­tal fe­male pop­u­la­tion aged 15 years and above were eco­nom­i­cally ac­tive. This rose to 29.5 per cent in 1970 and 44.3 per cent in 1980. Now, 73.3 per cent of women in the prime work­ing age of 25 to 64 are work­ing, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from last year.</p>
    <p>To­day, the women in higher ed­u­ca­tion out­num­ber men by a mar­gin of about 15 per cent, and the gen­der pay gap is clos­ing – at 6 per cent in 2018 af­ter tak­ing into ac­count age and oc­cu­pa­tions, down from 8.8 per cent in 2002.</p>
    <p>While ef­forts con­tinue in the pub­lic do­main to help women gain par­ity with men in school and at the work­place, the next big fron­tier in the bat­tle for gen­der equal­ity lies in a more in­ti­mate sphere: the home.</p>
    <p>Moth­ers spend three hours and 51 min­utes di­rectly en­gaged with their child on week­days, com­pared with one hour and 44 min­utes for fa­thers, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Lon­gi­tu­di­nal Early De­vel­op­ment Study con­ducted by NUS’ Cen­tre for Fam­ily and Pop­u­la­tion Re­search.</p>
    <p>Women also do a dis­pro­por­tion­ate share of the housework, with stud­ies else­where in­di­cat­ing that they spend about one hour more a day on housework com­pared with men.</p>
    <p>RE­CRUIT­ING AL­LIES AT HOME</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, some poli­cies that are pro-fam­ily re­in­force those stereo­types. For ex­am­ple, moth­ers are en­ti­tled to 16 weeks of paid leave af­ter child­birth.</p>
    <p>The time al­lows new moth­ers to re­cu­per­ate. But such ma­ter­nity leave also con­trib­utes to trap­ping women in the tra­di­tional roles as­cribed to them by so­ci­ety – that of stay-at-home mum and main care­giver of the child.</p>
    <p>While women are no doubt grate­ful for the time with their chil­dren, tak­ing on a larger share of child-car­ing dur­ing the early months or years of a child’s life can mean that chil­dren be­come more ac­cus­tomed to their moth­ers, and also set ex­pec­ta­tions in fam­i­lies and en­trench norms in so­ci­ety that women should be the main care­giver of chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­ri­ence else­where sug­gests hav­ing parental leave re­served for fa­thers cre­ates a pos­i­tive ef­fect on the long-term in­volve­ment of men in house­hold work and child­care.</p>
    <p>In Que­bec, Canada, fa­thers had been re­luc­tant to take parental leave in the early 2000s, even though they could share this leave with moth­ers. But af­ter the Cana­dian government put in place a pro­gramme of non-trans­fer­able pa­ter­nity leave of five weeks in 2006, take-up rates of such leave jumped by 250 per cent. These days, over 80 per cent of Que­bec fa­thers take their pa­ter­nity leave.</p>
    <p>Com­pare this with Sin­ga­pore, which has two weeks of non-trans­fer­able pa­ter­nity leave for fa­thers, who are also al­lowed to share part of their wives’ ma­ter­nity leave.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Government’s on­go­ing ef­forts to get men more in­volved in rais­ing their chil­dren, num­bers by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment show that the take-up rate for pa­ter­nity leave was 35 per cent in 2018, com­pared with 53 per cent in 2017 and 47 per cent in 2016. In those three years, more than 94 per cent of fa­thers did not take up any shared leave.</p>
    <p>In some coun­tries, gov­ern­ments of­fer in­cen­tives for fa­thers to take up shared parental leave. Fam­i­lies in Swe­den, for in­stance, can get a gen­der-equal­ity fi­nan­cial bonus for ev­ery day of such leave shared equally. The bonus can go up to US$1,900 (S$2,600) per month when both par­ents share the gen­er­ous 16 months of paid leave equally.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown changes in so­cial norms in coun­tries where fa­thers have played a larger share in child­care at the start of their child’s life. In Que­bec house­holds, fa­thers who took pa­ter­nity leave spent a higher per­cent­age of time on house­hold work com­pared with those who did not, and this pat­tern con­tin­ued long af­ter their leave pe­riod ended.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits of shared par­ent­hood ex­tend be­yond the home, and also has an in­trin­sic link to gen­der equal­ity in the work­place.</p>
    <p>A study of Ger­man cou­ples found that al­low­ing both men and women to have flex­i­ble work­ing ar­range­ments to care for their chil­dren boosted the wages of both par­ents, but es­pe­cially for moth­ers, re­ported The Guardian news­pa­per in 2018.</p>
    <p>AN IS­SUE FOR MEN TOO</p>
    <p>So what more can be done to shift at­ti­tudes here?</p>
    <p>One area the re­view can look into is so­ci­etal ex­pec­ta­tions on men.</p>
    <p>Sex­ual di­vi­sion of labour is harm­ful to women, and men as well, and how men be­have is also pro­foundly shaped by the so­cial and cul­tural ex­pec­ta­tions of mas­culin­ity.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal tough­ness, fi­nan­cial in­de­pen­dence and emo­tional sto­icism are just some of the so­cial norms ex­pected of men.</p>
    <p>In an on­line sur­vey by con­sumer re­search firm Mi­lieu, 80 per cent of men who were polled cited a suc­cess­ful ca­reer and be­ing the bread­win­ner of the fam­ily as ex­pec­ta­tions they had of them­selves, in­di­cat­ing they had in­ter­nalised the so­cial norms.</p>
    <p>But at­ti­tudes are chang­ing. A younger gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­porean men are shed­ding the at­ti­tude that child­care is emas­cu­lat­ing, and these days, hav­ing changed soiled di­a­pers and wak­ing up to bot­tle-feed their ba­bies are worn as badges of hon­our even among the “bros”. Younger par­ents like these are more likely to break out of stereo­types and not raise their chil­dren into gen­dered roles where girls do chores and pick up af­ter their broth­ers.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions like the Cen­tre for Father­ing have also sought to in­crease men’s in­volve­ment in child­care.</p>
    <p>Such ef­forts are laud­able, but on their own may be hard-pressed to over­turn the so­cial con­ven­tions that shape what is con­sid­ered nor­mal or ac­cept­able be­hav­iour for men. Em­ploy­ers, too, need to come on board and shift work­place norms. Some men may be keen to take pa­ter­nity leave to change di­a­pers – but do not do so due to work pres­sures, real or imag­ined.</p>
    <p>The ex­pec­ta­tion of men as the main fi­nan­cial provider in the fam­ily thus re­sults in a stigma be­ing as­so­ci­ated with men car­ing full-time for chil­dren, re­in­forc­ing so­cial norms about gen­der roles both ways.</p>
    <p>The life and mar­riage of the late Amer­i­can ju­rist and fem­i­nist icon Ruth Bader Gins­burg, who died last Fri­day, aged 87, is a good ex­am­ple of how a man’s will­ing­ness to break bar­ri­ers at home had al­lowed his wife to break bar­ri­ers at the work­place. At a time when housework and child-rear­ing were still very much con­sid­ered a woman’s re­spon­si­bil­ity, Mr Martin Gins­burg, a suc­cess­ful lawyer him­self, shared do­mes­tic re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and was the cook at home.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Gins­burg had said in her Supreme Court con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing: “I have had the great good for­tune to share life with a part­ner truly ex­tra­or­di­nary for his gen­er­a­tion, a man who be­lieved at age 18 when we met, and who be­lieves to­day, that a woman’s work, whether at home or on the job, is as im­por­tant as a man’s.”</p>
    <p>While the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is said to have set women back in their pur­suit of gen­der equal­ity, it has also pro­vided a once-in-a-life­time op­por­tu­nity for the mil­lions of men forced to work from home to see just how dif­fi­cult it is to bal­ance work, care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and house­hold chores.</p>
    <p>The hope is that this will spark a mind­set change. But to help them along, per­haps it is time also to look at how men can be armed with the con­fi­dence to break out of the stereo­types that they them­selves are sub­jected to, so that they too can choose to be the kind of sup­port­ive hus­band that Mr Gins­burg was.</p>
    <p>But of course the is­sue of gen­der equal­ity can­not de­pend on in­di­vid­ual men chang­ing their mind­sets. Fam­ily poli­cies, too, must sup­port gen­der equal­ity, in­clud­ing the di­vi­sion of roles at home.</p>
