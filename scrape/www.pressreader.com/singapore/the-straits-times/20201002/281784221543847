    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) has broad­ened its in­ves­ti­ga­tion of a se­ri­ous ill­ness i n As­traZeneca’s Covid-19 vac­cine study and will look at data from ear­lier tri­als of sim­i­lar vac­cines de­vel­oped by the same sci­en­tists, three sources fa­mil­iar with the de­tails told Reuters.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca’s large, late-stage United States trial has re­mained on hold since Sept 6, af­ter a study par­tic­i­pant in Bri­tain fell ill with what was be­lieved to be a rare spinal in­flam­ma­tory dis­or­der called trans­verse myeli­tis.</p>
    <p>The widened scope of the FDA probe raises the like­li­hood of ad­di­tional de­lays for what has been one of the most ad­vanced Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates in de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The re­quested data was ex­pected to ar­rive this week, af­ter which the FDA would need time to an­a­lyse it, two of the sources said.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has pledged US$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.64 bil­lion) to sup­port de­vel­op­ment of the As­traZeneca vac­cine and se­cure 300 mil­lion doses for the US.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors in Bri­tain, Brazil, In­dia and South Africa have al­lowed As­traZeneca to re­sume its clin­i­cal tri­als there. The FDA, how­ever, wants to de­ter­mine whether sim­i­lar side ef­fects emerged in tri­als of other vac­cines de­signed by As­traZeneca’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine part­ner, re­searchers at Oxford Univer­sity, the sources said. That does not mean the agency be­lieves there were safety is­sues as­so­ci­ated with any of these vac­cines, they added. “It just shows that the FDA is be­ing thor­ough,” said one of the sources.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca, in a state­ment, said: “We are con­tin­u­ing to work with the FDA to fa­cil­i­tate re­view of the in­for­ma­tion needed to make a de­ci­sion re­gard­ing re­sump­tion of the US trial.”</p>
    <p>All of the vac­cines it wants to re­view use a mod­i­fied ade­n­ovirus as a vec­tor to safely de­liver ge­netic ma­te­rial from the tar­get ill­nesses – flu, Mid­dle East res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome and other dis­eases – into the body to stim­u­late an im­mune sys­tem re­sponse to fight fu­ture in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>While other vac­cine de­vel­op­ers have used hu­man ade­n­oviruses for such vac­cines, the Oxford re­searchers chose an ade­n­ovirus found in chim­panzees. They felt this would re­duce the like­li­hood that an in­di­vid­ual’s im­mune sys­tem would at­tack the vec­tor virus due to prior ex­po­sure rather than the in­tended tar­get.</p>
