    <p>Tai­wan will not al­low oth­ers to dis­play mil­i­tary might in its ter­ri­to­rial airspace, Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen said yes­ter­day, as she praised the “heroic per­for­mance” of air force pi­lots who have been in­ter­cept­ing Chi­nese jets that have ap­proached the is­land. She toured an air force base in Penghu that sits on the front lines of Tai­wan’s air de­fences.</p>
    <p>PENGHU (Tai­wan) Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen has praised the “heroic per­for­mance” of Tai­wan’s air force pi­lots who have been in­ter­cept­ing Chi­nese jets that ap­proached the is­land, as the armed forces held drills to sim­u­late re­puls­ing an at­tack.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween China and Tai­wan, which Bei­jing sees as a rene­gade prov­ince to be re­united with the main­land, are at their high­est in years. Tai­wanese fighter jets were scram­bled to in­ter­cept the Chi­nese air­craft last week.</p>
    <p>Vis­it­ing a ma­jor air force base on Penghu in the sen­si­tive Tai­wan Strait that di­vides the two sides, Ms Tsai yes­ter­day told pi­lots and en­gi­neers she was aware of their “heroic per­for­mance” when in­ter­cept­ing Chi­nese mil­i­tary air­craft.</p>
    <p>“I have a lot of con­fi­dence in you. As soldiers of the Repub­lic of China, how could we let en­e­mies strut around in our own airspace?” she said, us­ing Tai­wan’s for­mal name ROC.</p>
    <p>“I’m aware that fac­ing the provoca­tive be­hav­iour of the com­mu­nist planes that have en­cir­cled the is­land and dam­aged re­gional peace in re­cent days, your duty at the front line of the airspace in Penghu must be even heav­ier.”</p>
    <p>The base, home to F-CK-1 Chingkuo In­dige­nous De­fence Fight­ers (IDFs) which first en­tered ser­vice in 1997, is at the front line of Tai­wan’s re­sponse to Chi­nese jets.</p>
    <p>Se­nior of­fi­cer Wang Chia-chu of the “Heav­enly Colt” IDF squadron said there are just five min­utes to scram­ble fight­ers once Chi­nese mil­i­tary jets are spot­ted.</p>
    <p>“We will de­fend our airspace in real time as long as there’s a threat,” he added.</p>
    <p>An­other se­nior of­fi­cer, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, told Reuters the Penghu-based IDFs are now scram­bling “al­most ev­ery day” as ten­sions run high.</p>
    <p>The air force also put on dis­play its new Wan Chien air-to-ground cruise mis­siles that en­tered ser­vice in 2018 and can be fired from IDFs at tar­gets about 200km away, putting Chi­nese fa­cil­i­ties or ap­proach­ing ships in their sights.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, De­fence Min­is­ter Yen Teh-fa over­saw drills sim­u­lat­ing a re­sponse to an air at­tack, in­volv­ing all of Tai­wan’s air bases as well as naval and sur­face-to-air mis­sile units, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>“The en­emy threat grows by the day,” it cited Mr Yen as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese air­craft last week breached the mid-line of the Tai­wan Strait, an un­of­fi­cial bar­rier for com­bat air­craft of both sides, though they have not flown over main­land Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, China’s For­eign Min­istry said the line did not ex­ist, draw­ing con­dem­na­tion from Tai­wan For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu.</p>
    <p>In Taipei yes­ter­day, Mr Wu called the line an im­por­tant “sym­bol” for avoid­ing mil­i­tary clashes, adding: “We de­mand the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity strongly con­demns China’s words and ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>China has been an­gered by ris­ing United States sup­port for Tai­wan, in­clud­ing a visit to Taipei last week by US Un­der­sec­re­tary for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Keith Krach.</p>
