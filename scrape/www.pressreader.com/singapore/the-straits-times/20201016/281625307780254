    <p>A dam­aged power ca­ble led to a se­ries of events that caused a ma­jor MRT dis­rup­tion af­fect­ing three train lines on Wed­nes­day night – an in­ci­dent which trans­port ex­perts said could have been avoided.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tor SMRT Cor­po­ra­tion – which runs the North-South, East-West and Cir­cle lines which were hit – said in an up­date yes­ter­day that the in­ci­dent started with the break­down of the in­su­la­tion of a power ca­ble.</p>
    <p>The ca­ble was be­tween the Tuas Link and Tuas West Road sta­tions on the East-West Line.</p>
    <p>A cir­cuit breaker at Tuas West Road sta­tion should have kicked in to iso­late the fault, but it did not.</p>
    <p>This caused the North-South and East-West lines’ power sys­tem to trip, bring­ing down stretches of Sin­ga­pore’s two old­est and most-used train lines at 7pm, dur­ing the evening peak hour, and af­fect­ing thou­sands of com­muters. The af­fected sta­tions were be­tween Wood­lands and Jurong East on the NorthSouth Line, and Queen­stown and Gul Cir­cle on the East-West Line.</p>
    <p>The power fault caused black­outs at train sta­tions and stranded com­muters on trains along the tracks.</p>
    <p>SMRT then tried to draw power from the Buona Vista In­take sub­sta­tion, which also serves the Cir­cle Line. How­ever, this was done with­out first iso­lat­ing the ini­tial fault.</p>
    <p>This re­sulted in the Cir­cle Line be­ing hit at 7.30pm and more com­muters be­ing af­fected as there were no train ser­vices along a 16sta­tion stretch, from Har­bourFront to Seran­goon sta­tions.</p>
    <p>SMRT said it is work­ing with the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) to con­duct a full in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the “pre­ma­ture fail­ure” of the com­po­nents. The equip­ment man­u­fac­tur­ers which sup­plied the parts are also be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s train dis­rup­tion was</p>
    <p>the worst of its kind to hit the MRT net­work since 2017, when stretches of the North-South and East-West lines were also dis­rupted due to a power fault.</p>
    <p>The con­cur­rent fail­ure of three train lines is also rare.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the fault on Wed­nes­day is un­re­lated to on­go­ing power re­place­ment works on the NorthSouth and East-West lines. It orig­i­nated from a stretch of the EastWest Line that is rel­a­tively new and not in­volved in the re­place­ment works.</p>
    <p>The dis­rup­tion was likely a one-off in­ci­dent due to the con­flu­ence of fac­tors that in­creased the scale of the</p>
    <p>dis­rup­tion, said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ray­mond Ong of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, who re­searches trans­port in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>But he said SMRT has to relook how it re­acts to faults: “There needs to be pro­to­cols in place to pre­vent one sys­tem from af­fect­ing another. This is crit­i­cal. Wed­nes­day’s in­ci­dent was avoid­able.”</p>
    <p>He added that a bet­ter evac­u­a­tion plan in the event of in­clement weather is also nec­es­sary, as the el­derly and sick will suf­fer dur­ing the pro­longed wait.</p>
    <p>The evac­u­a­tion of some trains took nearly three hours on Wed­nes­day, with the wet weather and light­ning risks im­ped­ing progress.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences trans­port re­searcher Park Byung Joon said it was easy with the ben­e­fit of hind­sight to blame SMRT for draw­ing power from the sub­sta­tion with­out first iso­lat­ing the fault, but it must be noted that a de­ci­sion had to be made there and then with im­per­fect in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“They were fac­ing mul­ti­ple fail­ures and did not have the full pic­ture,” he said. “They should cre­ate a check­list so that they know what to do in case of mul­ti­ple fail­ures like this to pre­vent it from hap­pen­ing again.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on the side­lines of a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day to an­nounce that Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore had agreed to es­tab­lish an air</p>
    <p>travel bub­ble, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the in­ci­dent was a re­minder to him and trans­port op­er­a­tors not to be com­pla­cent.</p>
    <p>“(The MRT net­work) is a com­plex sys­tem, ev­ery lit­tle part mat­ters, just as ev­ery worker, ev­ery en­gi­neer, ev­ery sta­tion man­ager also mat­ters,” he said.</p>
    <p>“(We must) con­tinue to work hard to­gether to make sure the sys­tem works as well as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s in­ci­dent was the first ma­jor dis­rup­tion the Trans­port Min­is­ter has had to face since he took over the port­fo­lio in Au­gust.</p>
