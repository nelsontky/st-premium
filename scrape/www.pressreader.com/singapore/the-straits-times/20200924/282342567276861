    <p>MAR­SEILLE • French police have re­leased two peo­ple who were ques­tioned as part of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into sus­pected dop­ing by the Arkea-Sam­sic team at the re­cently con­cluded Tour de France, the Mar­seille pros­e­cu­tor’s of­fice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a raid on the team’s ho­tel in Meri­bel af­ter the com­pe­ti­tion’s 17th stage, the au­thor­i­ties found health prod­ucts, in­clud­ing sub­stances and items that could be linked to dop­ing.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors had been ques­tion­ing two peo­ple in the en­tourage of the French team’s lead rider, Nairo Quin­tana, twice a run­ner-up in the Tour and a former Vuelta a Es­pana and Giro d’Italia cham­pion.</p>
    <p>The Colom­bian, who was al­lowed to con­tinue work­ing with his own doc­tor when he signed a three-year deal with Arkea-Sam­sic ear­lier this year, has de­nied us­ing any banned sub­stances.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old said in a state­ment late on Tues­day: “No dop­ing sub­stance has ever been found. I have noth­ing to hide and have never had any­thing to hide.”</p>
    <p>Quin­tana, who fin­ished 17th over­all last Sun­day, added he had an­swered all the ques­tions with “a clear con­science” and claimed that only “per­fectly le­gal vi­ta­min sup­ple­ments” were found in the search.</p>
    <p>Although no names have been re­leased, French daily Le Parisien re­ported that the ar­rested duo were a doc­tor and phys­io­ther­a­pist, and the probe re­mains an ac­tive one de­spite their re­lease.</p>
    <p>Arkea-Sam­sic have thrown their sup­port be­hind those in­volved, but will not hes­i­tate to act if the dop­ing charges – which can re­sult in up to five years in jail and a €75,000 (S$119,800) fine – are proven.</p>
