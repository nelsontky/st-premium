    <p>At the height of the pan­demic, nurs­ing homes be­came out of bounds to vis­i­tors and vol­un­teers to pro­tect their vul­ner­a­ble el­derly res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>So Cy­cling With­out Age Sin­ga­pore, a char­ity which takes se­niors from nurs­ing homes and se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres out for tr­ishaw rides, turned to tech­nol­ogy to con­tinue giv­ing the el­derly a chance to ex­plore Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The char­ity worked with Mind Palace, a so­cial en­ter­prise that de­vel­ops vir­tual re­al­ity (VR) tech­nol­ogy for se­niors, to de­velop a VR tr­ishaw ride.</p>
    <p>Us­ing a tr­ishaw, they filmed some of the routes the char­ity used to take se­niors on, like in Ad­mi­ralty Park, Bis­han Park and Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>All the se­niors had to do then was to put on a VR head­set, and for the next 10 min­utes they would en­joy the view as though they were ac­tu­ally tak­ing the tr­ishaw ride.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive started in Au­gust and more than 80 se­niors have had the VR ride so far.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Rahim Ab­dul­lah, 64, a res­i­dent at the Jamiyah Nurs­ing Home, is one of them. Mr Rahim, whose mo­bil­ity has been af­fected by a stroke, said: “It’s very good. I like the view, it feels like I’m ac­tu­ally out there ex­plor­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Bar­tolome, a ther­apy as­sis­tant at Jamiyah Nurs­ing Home, said most of the res­i­dents there en­joyed the VR ride as it al­lowed them to ex­plore Sin­ga­pore with­out go­ing out.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling With­out Age was started in 2012 by Dan­ish so­cial en­tre­pre­neur Ole Kas­sow. The move­ment is now in 35 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Dan­ish ex­pa­tri­ate Pernille Bus­sone had a free tr­ishaw, given by a Dan­ish univer­sity, shipped to Sin­ga­pore and started tak­ing se­niors here for rides.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean so­cial en­tre­pre­neur Aaron Yeoh and Ms Marieke Bink, who is also Dan­ish, car­ried on Ms Bus­sone’s work af­ter she went back to Den­mark.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling With­out Age Sin­ga­pore was reg­is­tered as a char­ity in 2018, said its gen­eral man­ager Ad­die Eli­cano. It now has 10 tr­ishaws spon­sored by Te­masek Foun­da­tion for its Mov­ing Gen­er­a­tions pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, youth vol­un­teers took se­niors on elec­tricpow­ered tr­ishaws to var­i­ous parks and park con­nec­tors around the is­land, with more than 6,000 rides car­ried out.</p>
    <p>Ms Eli­cano said: “The se­niors love it. Some of them have lim­ited mo­bil­ity. (With the tr­ishaw), they get to go out. They get to go to green spa­ces and feel the wind in their hair.”</p>
    <p>El­derly or dis­abled mem­bers of the pub­lic who would like to try the ser­vice for free can call 8189-9434.</p>
