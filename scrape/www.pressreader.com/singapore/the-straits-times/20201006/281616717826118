    <p>There will be ad­di­tional sup­port for par­ents of new­borns, to help cou­ples who have post­poned their plans to have chil­dren due to the fi­nan­cial un­cer­tainty brought about by the pan­demic, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>This one-off sup­port mea­sure comes on top of the Baby Bonus Cash Gift, which pro­vides el­i­gi­ble par­ents with up to $10,000 in ben­e­fits, he said in a min­is­te­rial state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah, who oversees the Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion and Tal­ent Di­vi­sion, will pro­vide more de­tails on this soon, he added.</p>
    <p>In his state­ment, Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, pledged to con­tinue sup­port­ing house­holds amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial aid un­der sup­port schemes will con­tinue to flow to house­holds in the com­ing months, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>This month, for in­stance, el­i­gi­ble house­holds will re­ceive more re­bates on their util­ity bills through the goods and ser­vices tax voucher U-Save scheme.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also noted that de­spite ef­forts to help them, some firms, es­pe­cially in the hard­est-hit sec­tors, may not sur­vive or may have to re­lease their work­ers.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port work­ers who have lost their jobs by help­ing them to ac­quire new skills and move into firms that are hir­ing, he pledged.</p>
    <p>As at end-Au­gust, the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil has cu­rated 117,500 op­por­tu­ni­ties un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, noted Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“This is good progress, but we must press on,” he added.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil is work­ing closely with com­pa­nies to hire mid-ca­reer job seek­ers look­ing to make a switch in their ca­reers, and to re­de­ploy work­ers in af­fected sec­tors to ar­eas of need.</p>
    <p>It is also en­gag­ing com­pa­nies to of­fer trainee­ships, com­pany at­tach­ments and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>“The key task now is to make sure that work­ers know of, and are suc­cess­fully matched to these op­por­tu­ni­ties,” said Mr Heng, adding that this is be­ing done across mul­ti­ple chan­nels, in­clud­ing SGUnited Jobs and Skills Cen­tres in HDB towns.</p>
    <p>To help those who have lost their jobs, the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, which helps Sin­ga­pore­ans who have been laid off or suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss, has been ex­tended to De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Be­yond this year, the Gov­ern­ment is also study­ing sup­port mea­sures for self-em­ployed peo­ple and work­ers who are most vul­ner­a­ble, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Whether sup­port schemes con­tinue, and what form they will take, will de­pend on the labour mar­ket sit­u­a­tion and eco­nomic out­look, he said, with one key con­sid­er­a­tion be­ing the need to make a stronger link to help­ing in­di­vid­u­als find a new job or to ac­quire new skills.</p>
    <p>An up­date will be pro­vided be­fore the end of the year, he added.</p>
