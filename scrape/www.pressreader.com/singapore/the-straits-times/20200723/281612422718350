    <p>Hong Kong will ex­tend strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, or­der­ing peo­ple to wear masks in all in­door pub­lic ar­eas, as the city re­ported 113 coro­n­avirus cases yesterday – with the source of in­fec­tions for about half of them un­known. Hong Kong will also add the United States and Kaza­khstan to its list of high-risk ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions i n Hong Kong jumped yesterday, prompt­ing reg­u­la­tors to man­date that the pub­lic must wear face masks in all in­door pub­lic venues.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong added 113 new Covid-19 cases, with the source of in­fec­tion for about half of them un­known. So far, the to­tal tally stands at 2,132.</p>
    <p>The new cases i nclude many teach­ers and ho­tel staff, and 105 are lo­cal trans­mis­sions, with 42 linked to ear­lier in­fec­tions. The health au­thor­i­ties said 27 of the pa­tients caught the virus from hav­ing meals with family mem­bers and friends.</p>
    <p>At a brief­ing, Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said the new rule that would make it com­pul­sory for peo­ple to wear face masks in in­door pub­lic venues, such as su­per­mar­kets, build­ing lob­bies and shop­ping malls, would kick in to­day and last for 14 days.</p>
    <p>The move fol­lows a spe­cial morn­ing Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil meet­ing and is on top of the gov­ern­ment’s rule on July 15 re­quir­ing peo­ple to wear face masks when tak­ing pub­lic trans­port, or risk a HK$5,000 (S$893) fine.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chan noted that more than 80 per cent of the 700 cases in the past two weeks have been due to lo­cal trans­mis­sion and the sources of in­fec­tion for many are un­known.</p>
    <p>While she does not rule out more strin­gent mea­sures, Prof Chan did not in­di­cate if Hong Kong would soon go into lock­down and cau­tioned that large-scale com­mu­nity out­breaks are likely.</p>
    <p>“Whether there will be a lock­down de­pends on the en­tire sit­u­a­tion. We are look­ing at some of the in­ter­na­tional prac­tices and we also have to balance the needs and also the ba­sic daily ne­ces­si­ties of the peo­ple in Hong Kong, for ex­am­ple, food, hav­ing to seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion, drugs, and so th­ese are es­sen­tial ser­vices that peo­ple need,” she said.</p>
    <p>From next Wed­nes­day, pas­sen­gers head­ing to Hong Kong from the United States and Kaza­khstan will have to present proof of a neg­a­tive coro­n­avirus test be­fore they can board the plane.</p>
    <p>They will also have to show that they have re­served a ho­tel room for at least 14 days upon their ar­rival in the city.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, pas­sen­gers ar­riv­ing from places iden­ti­fied as high-risk ar­eas, such as Bangladesh, In­done­sia, India, Nepal, Pak­istan, the Philip­pines and South Africa, have to show proof of a neg­a­tive nu­cleic acid test for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This proof is to be ob­tained within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>When asked if the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tion sched­uled for Sept 6 would be post­poned, Prof Chan said there is no change to this for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yesterday, mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist Ho Pak Le­ung from Hong Kong Univer­sity said that the gov­ern­ment could make it manda­tory for the pub­lic to wear face masks out­doors too.</p>
    <p>He cau­tioned that it would take about five more days to see if ex­ist­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have been ef­fec­tive in con­trol­ling the coro­n­avirus out­breaks in the city.</p>
    <p>A week ago, the gov­ern­ment tight­ened re­stric­tions, with din­ing in at all eater­ies banned from 6pm to 5am and only take­aways al­lowed.</p>
    <p>The 50-per­son cap for pub­lic gath­er­ings was whit­tled down to four. Venues like gyms, bars and night­clubs were also or­dered to shut for seven days.</p>
    <p>Last week’s tight­en­ing of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures came a week after an ini­tial round where the op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity of all eater­ies was capped at 60 per cent and at eight cus­tomers per ta­ble.</p>
    <p>The Hang Seng Index ended the day in the red – its big­gest fall since June 11 – drop­ping 2.25 per cent or 577.72 points to 25,057.94 fol­low­ing a rally the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
