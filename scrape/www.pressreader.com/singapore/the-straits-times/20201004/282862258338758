    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) will not launch flights to nowhere. How­ever, mem­bers of the pub­lic still can ex­pe­ri­ence the air­line’s lauded in-flight ser­vice in the form of sev­eral on-the-ground ini­tia­tives. These are lunch in an Air­bus A-380, a be­hind-the-scenes tour at SIA’s train­ing fa­cil­ity, and in-flight meals de­liv­ered con­ve­niently to the doorstep. The of­fer­ings fol­low the air­line’s de­ci­sion to not em­bark on flights to nowhere be­cause of en­vi­ron­men­tal con­sid­er­a­tions and rea­sons of fi­nan­cial vi­a­bil­ity. In­stead, SIA is lev­er­ag­ing on the qual­ity of its in-flight menu and metic­u­lous ser­vice to re­tain its bond­ing with cus­tomers, al­beit in vi­car­i­ous form.</p>
    <p>This is an imag­i­na­tive move. The SIA boast – “Ser­vice even other air­lines talk about” – is not an idle one, nor is it just a mar­ket­ing gim­mick. It is an in­gre­di­ent of the air­line’s hard-earned story of sur­vival and suc­cess. When SIA be­gan to op­er­ate in 1972, it could not com­pete with the fleet sizes, route net­works and rep­u­ta­tions of es­tab­lished air­lines. All that it had go­ing for it was some­thing which ev­ery air­line en­joys on a level play­ing field at the point of en­try: in-flight ser­vice.</p>
    <p>SIA’s abil­ity to make fly­ing not just a func­tional ne­ces­sity but also an en­joy­able ex­pe­ri­ence on its own en­abled it to hold on to its patch of sky in an in­tensely com­pet­i­tive avi­a­tion in­dus­try. Other air­lines, seek­ing a sim­i­lar for­mula for suc­cess, have fol­lowed in SIA’s trail, pay­ing it no small com­pli­ment in the process. The chal­lenge now is for SIA to main­tain its high ser­vice stan­dards while re­main­ing com­pet­i­tive on costs.</p>
    <p>That game will re­sume after the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is over. Mean­while, SIA, like other air­lines, will have to seek out in­no­va­tive recipes for sur­vival. Brand­ing plays no small part in that. Sin­ga­pore­ans, who used to criss-cross the world in their na­tional air­line, could re­cip­ro­cate by sup­port­ing its ini­tia­tives in these fleet-grounded times.</p>
