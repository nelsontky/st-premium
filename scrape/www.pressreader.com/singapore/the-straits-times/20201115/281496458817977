    <p>Mr Chris Moises Canaveral, a third mate on board a 22,000-tonne tanker, has not stepped on land in 10 months. He ex­pects to still be out at sea come Christ­mas and New Year.</p>
    <p>He said he is used to it. He first set foot on a mer­chant ship 10 years ago, when he was 26. Since then, he has been home to cel­e­brate Christ­mas with his fam­ily just four times. “It’s hard, but we’re sea­men. We’re used to iso­la­tion and soli­tude,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even so, this is the long­est he has been away, and it is al­ready feel­ing like he is “in prison, with a bunch of very grumpy men”.</p>
    <p>Mr Canaveral is one of more than 400,000 sea­far­ers around the world who have had to re­main on board their ships for about a year or longer be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pandemic. They are not meant to be work­ing for more than 11 months in a row, but some of his ship­mates have been stuck at sea for up to 18 months.</p>
    <p>With tough health pro­to­cols ev­ery­where, there are very few ports that al­low the crew of cargo and cruise ships to come ashore.</p>
    <p>While many coun­tries sub­scribe to the In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s pro­to­col on crew changes dur­ing the pandemic that was in­sti­tuted in May and re­vised last month, and recog­nise sea­far­ers as key work­ers, each coun­try main­tains its own set of re­quire­ments. A lot can de­pend on whether vis­it­ing sailors are com­ing from coun­tries with high Covid-19 risk.</p>
    <p>A few months ago, at­tempt­ing to change a crew in­volved a host of doc­u­ments re­quired by dif­fer­ent coun­tries, un­der­stand­ing and com­ply­ing with each coun­try’s health re­quire­ments, and sourc­ing flights when the avi­a­tion in­dus­try had come to a stand­still.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the cost of crew changes has be­come com­plex and very ex­pen­sive, some­times cost­ing up­wards of $200,000 to di­vert a ves­sel to a port that will ac­cept a crew change. Ship­ping firms are thus mak­ing their sailors work for as long as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In­dian ship cap­tain Sukh Pal and his crew, for in­stance, were not al­ways suc­cess­ful in get­ting crew signed off or on, while nav­i­gat­ing what he called un­charted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Their ves­sel, a 270 dead­weight ton­nage ore car­rier, plied the seas from China, Africa and Brazil.</p>
    <p>“In some ports, you are not al­lowed to sign off,” said Capt Pal, 64. “In­spec­tors come on board to check our Sea­farer’s Em­ploy­ment Agree­ment, which dis­al­lows you to work on board a ves­sel for more than 11 months. But if I’m not al­lowed to stay on board, then how do I get off the ship when coun­tries don’t wel­come you?”</p>
    <p>His plans for some crew to dis­em­bark in the Philip­pines were shelved be­cause of Su­per Typhoon Goni, which struck on Nov 1.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pandemic, his Plan B might have been to head to Sin­ga­pore in­stead, but since the pandemic, the Repub­lic has been re­quir­ing doc­u­ments sub­mit­ted two weeks prior to dock­ing.</p>
    <p>On their nine-month voy­age, Capt Pal was able to get a hand­ful of crew off the ves­sel in ports in China, the Philip­pines (be­fore Goni) and Guinea. Other ports dis­al­lowed crew changes or sign­ing off. But though ships could not sign off crew, cargo con­tin­ued to be moved.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, Capt Pal, who has had a 45-year ca­reer sail­ing the world’s seas, was for­tu­nate to be able to sign his crew off in Batam, In­done­sia, be­fore re­turn­ing home to In­dia.</p>
    <p>For ship­ping op­er­a­tors, these are costly and chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>An­glo-Eastern Ship Man­age­ment which has an of­fice in Sin­ga­pore, has 600 ves­sels world­wide and about 15,000 sea­far­ers in its em­ploy­ment. Its chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer, Cap­tain Suren­dra Dutt, said: “Lo­gis­ti­cally, it was a to­tal night­mare. It was al­most im­pos­si­ble to fig­ure out how to get peo­ple from one place to an­other be­cause of all the chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>Re­cently, the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore re­laxed some of its crew-change reg­u­la­tions to take into con­sid­er­a­tion those whose em­ploy­ment con­tracts had ex­pired, a change of</p>
    <p>crew due to the sale or pur­chase of ship, com­pas­sion­ate grounds or per­son­nel who were med­i­cally un­fit to work on a ship.</p>
    <p>But in Septem­ber, it was still com­mon to see stranded ves­sels such as bulk car­ri­ers, tankers and fish­ing ves­sels an­chored in Sin­ga­pore wa­ters, with their sailors from coun­tries such as Myan­mar, In­dia, China, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines loung­ing on the decks, wait­ing for their next as­sign­ments.</p>
    <p>The pro­longed time at sea is tak­ing a heavy toll on crew.</p>
    <p>“They com­plain a lot, and of­ten refuse to work. They’re al­ways on edge, and so cranky that you can’t tease them any­more,” said Mr Canaveral. He said he had heard sto­ries of fist fights and scuf­fles in­volv­ing knives on other ships.</p>
    <p>There is also a nag­ging fear that sick crew­men will not be able to re­ceive the treat­ment and med­i­ca­tion they can get only on land.</p>
    <p>Mr Canaveral said his ship en­gi­neer’s l eg and arm be­came so swollen with arthri­tis he could not get out of bed any­more. The cap­tain wanted to drop him off in Egypt, so he could be air­lifted back to the Philip­pines. But the doc­tor who came on board in­sisted there was no need as the man’s leg was not bro­ken. He was off­loaded in Sri Lanka in­stead a month later.</p>
    <p>An­other en­gi­neer suf­fered a slipped disc and was clas­si­fied as “un­fit to work”. But, un­able to dis­em­bark, he is still on board, un­der heavy med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>A Lloyd’s Reg­is­ter sur­vey in June found that stress, ex­haus­tion and de­pres­sion that go with ex­tended tours at sea were be­com­ing se­ri­ous risk fac­tors. One in 10 crew mem­bers said they could no longer fo­cus on work and were no longer “in good spir­its”. Two in five said they no longer woke up feel­ing rested.</p>
    <p>Many com­plained of the work­load, fa­tigue, food qual­ity and health. One re­marked: “We work for each and ev­ery one of you to have food, wa­ter, fuel, cars. We need sup­port in this tough time, but we were for­got­ten and aban­doned.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore doc­tor Charles John­son, med­i­cal di­rec­tor and flight physi­cian at Hope Med­flight Asia, has at­tended to sailors in re­cent months with med­i­cal con­cerns that ranged from self-in­flicted wounds to a heart at­tack. Ail­ments like dizzi­ness, in­som­nia and bad ap­petite are now more com­mon.</p>
    <p>Some shipown­ers have gone out</p>
    <p>of business and sailors work­ing for new own­ers have seen a sig­nif­i­cant drop in their salaries.</p>
    <p>Said Dr John­son, 52: “The sailors have many anx­i­eties. They don’t know if they can go home, and if they go home, if they can find an­other job as sea­far­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Canaveral counts him­self lucky. His ship has a gym, a swim­ming pool and an en­ter­tain­ment room. When­ever their ship is close enough to shore, crew mem­bers milk the chance to ac­cess so­cial me­dia ac­counts, video-chat with their fam­ily and close friends, and down­load movies.</p>
    <p>Some­times, out on the open sea, their ship will stop along­side an­other ship to trans­fer oil and cargo. This can take up to two days, enough time to meet crews of other ships and break the monotony.</p>
    <p>But it is their con­nec­tions to their fam­i­lies back home that keep the men go­ing. Mr Canaveral, a third-gen­er­a­tion sea­man, said he had missed his sib­lings’ wed­dings. The oth­ers on his ship have been through worse. Most were not home when their chil­dren grad­u­ated from univer­sity. One was away when his mother died.</p>
    <p>But these are sac­ri­fices that, for most sea­far­ers, are worth it.</p>
    <p>“If you ask us if we are will­ing to sac­ri­fice our own hap­pi­ness for our fam­i­lies, the an­swer will al­ways be, ‘Yes, many times, yes’,” said Mr Canaveral.</p>
    <p>A life at sea has pro­vided an es­cape from poverty for mil­lions of Filipinos. Cooks can earn up to US$2,500 (S$3,400) a month while the cap­tain of a tanker can make as much as US$15,000, more than what most ac­coun­tants, com­pany man­agers and bank vice-pres­i­dents make in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>About 400,000 of the world’s 1.6 mil­lion sea­far­ers are Filipinos, who send about US$6 bil­lion back to their coun­try each year.</p>
    <p>The Of­fice of the United Na­tions High Com­mis­sioner for Hu­man Rights has called sea­far­ers “col­lat­eral vic­tims” of the pandemic, and urged not just the ship­ping in­dus­try and na­tions to act, but also cor­po­ra­tions that rely on mar­itime trade. But an out­break on board a bulk car­rier re­ported last month in Aus­tralia sug­gests sea­far­ers will re­main in rough wa­ters as long as Covid-19 con­tin­ues to men­ace in­ter­na­tional bor­ders.</p>
    <p>In some ports, you are not al­lowed to sign off... In­spec­tors came on board to check our Sea­farer’s Em­ploy­ment Agree­ment, which dis­al­lows you to work on board a ves­sel for more than 11 months. But if I’m not al­lowed to stay on board, then how do I get off the ship when coun­tries don’t wel­come you? ’’</p>
    <p>IN­DIAN SHIP CAP­TAIN SUKH PAL</p>
    <p>UN­HAPPY CREW</p>
    <p>They com­plain a lot, and of­ten refuse to work. They’re al­ways on edge, and so cranky that you can’t tease them any­more.</p>
