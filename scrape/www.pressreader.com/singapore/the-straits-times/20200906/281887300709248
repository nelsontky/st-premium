    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said the United States must look “very se­ri­ously” into the sus­pected poi­son­ing of Rus­sian op­po­si­tion leader Alexei Navalny, but that his ad­min­is­tra­tion had not yet seen any proof.</p>
    <p>“It’s tragic. It’s ter­ri­ble, it shouldn’t hap­pen. We haven’t had any proof yet, but I will take a look,” Mr Trump said at a news con­fer­ence on Fri­day, be­fore telling jour­nal­ists they should be fo­cus­ing on China, not Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor</p>
    <p>An­gela</p>
    <p>Merkel said on Wed­nes­day that med­i­cal tests showed “un­equiv­o­cally” that Mr Navalny had been poi­soned by a mil­i­tary-grade Novi­chok nerve agent.</p>
    <p>Asked about the Ger­man con­clu­sion, Mr Trump said: “I hear Ger­many has made it de­fin­i­tive, or al­most de­fin­i­tive, but we have not seen it our­selves.”</p>
    <p>He did not take as strong a stand as did the State De­part­ment, which ear­lier on Fri­day ex­pressed grave con­cern about the find­ing that Mr Navalny was poi­soned.</p>
    <p>In a meeting in Wash­ing­ton ear­lier on Fri­day, Deputy Sec­re­tary of State Stephen Biegun told Rus­sian Ambassador Ana­toly Antonov that Moscow’s use of this chem­i­cal weapon would be a clear vi­o­la­tion of its obli­ga­tions un­der the Chem­i­cal Weapons Con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>“The Deputy Sec­re­tary urged Rus­sia to co­op­er­ate fully with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion into this at­tack,” de­part­ment spokesman Mor­gan Orta­gus said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, where Mr Navalny is cur­rently re­ceiv­ing treat­ment in a hos­pi­tal, has said it wants the per­pe­tra­tors of the al­leged poi­son­ing of the Rus­sian op­po­si­tion fig­ure to be held to ac­count.</p>
    <p>Krem­lin of­fi­cials have chal­lenged Ger­many’s con­clu­sion that Mr Navalny was poi­soned, say­ing that Dr Merkel’s govern­ment has not pro­vided proof of the crime. Rus­sia has un­til now not opened a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, the most prom­i­nent op­po­nent of Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, fell ill on a do­mes­tic flight to Moscow from Tomsk last month. He was evac­u­ated to hos­pi­tal in Ber­lin un­der in­ter­na­tional pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man an­nounce­ment last week that he was poi­soned by a nerve agent has raised the pos­si­bil­ity of fur­ther Western sanc­tions against Moscow.</p>
