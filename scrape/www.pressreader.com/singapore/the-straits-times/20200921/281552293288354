    <p>Shifts are un­der way in Europe as the re­al­i­sa­tion grows that the old con­cept of “change through trade”, which worked so well with the Soviet Union, is fail­ing with Bei­jing, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (be­low).</p>
    <p>The shifts may be slow, some­times im­per­cep­ti­ble, and of­ten con­tra­dic­tory. But make no mis­take: Europe is now in the throes of re-eval­u­at­ing its re­la­tions with China.</p>
    <p>And al­though the Euro­peans are highly un­likely to fol­low the United States in con­fronting China across the board and across the world, events over the past few weeks in­di­cate that the strat­egy re­think now tak­ing place in Euro­pean cap­i­tals – par­tic­u­larly in some of the con­ti­nent’s big­gest coun­tries such as Ger­many or France – is just as pro­found as the pol­icy re­view un­der­taken in Washington, and with just as many long-term con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>One of the key ar­gu­ments made by China crit­ics in the US is that the old as­sump­tion which un­der­pinned the en­gage­ment of Western pow­ers with China, ac­cord­ing to which the more China be­comes em­bed­ded in global trade and in­sti­tu­tions, the less threat­en­ing and more co­op­er­a­tive it would be­come, has failed.</p>
    <p>China, ar­gue the US crit­ics, has trans­lated its eco­nomic might into a mil­i­tary one and, far from be­ing more ac­com­mo­dat­ing, Bei­jing is now telling oth­ers in no un­cer­tain terms and with­out much po­lite­ness that it’s their turn to ac­com­mo­date Chi­nese in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>‘WAN­DEL DURCH HANDEL’</p>
    <p>Most of the China “hawks” in the US as­sume that this mis­taken as­sump­tion about the West’s abil­ity to “tame” China is an Amer­i­can in­ven­tion, started by Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon in the 1970s, and pur­sued by ev­ery Amer­i­can pres­i­dent since.</p>
    <p>“What do the Amer­i­can peo­ple have to show now 50 years on from en­gage­ment with China? Did the the­o­ries of our lead­ers that pro­posed China’s evo­lu­tion to­wards free­dom and democ­racy prove to be true?” US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo asked rhetor­i­cally in a re­cent speech.</p>
    <p>But al­though this may come as a sur­prise to Amer­i­can politi­cians, the idea that a coun­try can be fun­da­men­tally changed through trade is ac­tu­ally a Euro­pean one.</p>
    <p>It was in­vented well be­fore China was even a sub­ject of dis­cus­sion in Euro­pean cap­i­tals, and for many decades re­mained so en­trenched in the po­lit­i­cal psy­che of peo­ple such as the Ger­mans that it even has a term which rhymes in the Ger­man lan­guage: “Wan­del durch Handel”.</p>
    <p>It was this pol­icy that Ger­many re­sorted to dur­ing the Cold War, when the coun­try was di­vided and the only way the Ger­mans could hope to avoid a de­struc­tive nu­clear war while main­tain­ing some links with mil­lions of their brethren locked up in East Ger­many be­hind the Iron Cur­tain was through trade.</p>
    <p>That pol­icy was a mon­u­men­tal success. By the 1980s, not only East Ger­many but also the Soviet Union were de­pen­dent on Ger­man fi­nan­cial cred­its and trade. So, when the en­tire com­mu­nist sys­tem col­lapsed and Ger­many re­uni­fied, those who ad­vo­cated change through trade were hailed as vi­sion­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>It was there­fore en­tirely un­der­stand­able that Ger­many and other Euro­pean coun­tries would see the logic of fol­low­ing a sim­i­lar pol­icy in China.</p>
    <p>For, if the Soviet Union with its im­pla­ca­ble sus­pi­cion of the West and its de­ter­mi­na­tion to ex­port its ide­ol­ogy to the world could be tamed through the sup­ply of Western con­sumer goods, the re­sults could be even bet­ter in the case of China, a coun­try that has long given up on ex­port­ing its ide­ol­ogy and is only too ea­ger to pros­per.</p>
    <p>There are still politi­cians in Ger­many who be­lieve in this con­cept. Ger­man Econ­omy Min­is­ter Peter Alt­maier – a close con­fi­dant of Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel – told jour­nal­ists re­cently that eco­nomic en­gage­ment with China re­mains im­per­a­tive be­cause, as he says: “I still be­lieve that change can be achieved through trade.”</p>
    <p>But such views – which only a few years ago would have been re­garded as a state­ment of the blind­ingly ob­vi­ous – are now be­ing ques­tioned as at best naive, and at worst down­right dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>For, in re­al­ity, the com­par­i­son be­tween the change-through-trade poli­cies that Ger­many and the rest of Europe ap­plied to the Soviet Union and those that Europe tried to ap­ply to China is sim­ply in­ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sians and their com­mu­nist satel­lites be­came de­pen­dent on Western trade and cap­i­tal be­cause they used th­ese not to re­form their dys­func­tional com­mu­nist economies, but in or­der to keep th­ese go­ing with­out im­ple­ment­ing any change. Un­sur­pris­ingly, there­fore, they ended up both de­pen­dent on the West and bank­rupt.</p>
    <p>UN­FUL­FILLED HOPES</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese, how­ever, used en­gage­ment in the world trad­ing sys­tem and Western fi­nan­cial in­puts to over­haul their own national econ­omy. Equally, un­sur­pris­ingly, they there­fore ended up not only with a for­mi­da­ble econ­omy, but also be­ing masters of their own home.</p>
    <p>It is quite easy to es­tab­lish a re­la­tion­ship of de­pen­dency with an al­co­holic who sim­ply asks to be given fur­ther drink; it is quite an­other mat­ter to main­tain a de­pen­dency re­la­tion­ship with a for­mer al­co­holic who not only be­comes a tee­to­taller, but has also learnt how to man­u­fac­ture and sell his own al­co­holic bev­er­ages.</p>
    <p>For a while, the Euro­peans still per­suaded them­selves that, if China can­not be changed, it can at least pro­vide Europe’s sal­va­tion from eco­nomic de­cline. One af­ter an­other, Euro­pean lead­ers flew to Bei­jing or laid out the red car­pet for vis­it­ing Chi­nese lead­ers. Mega-bil­lion trade con­tracts were signed in a blaze of pub­lic­ity, promis­ing un­told riches that were about to flow through newly es­tab­lished “silk roads”.</p>
    <p>It did not mat­ter that many of th­ese large deals never ma­te­ri­alised; ev­ery Euro­pean leader still be­lieved that his or her coun­try was about to ex­pe­ri­ence a bo­nanza. The French be­lieved that China would be­come a never-end­ing mar­ket for their ex­quis­ite food and lux­ury goods, the Ger­mans saw China as their top mar­ket for in­dus­trial ma­chin­ery and cars, and the Bri­tish per­suaded them­selves that Chi­nese cash would sus­tain the fi­nan­cial pre-em­i­nence of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Most of th­ese hopes have now evap­o­rated. No­body doubts that China re­mains a key mar­ket. But Euro­peans are los­ing patience with the bu­reau­cratic ob­sta­cles, forced tech­nol­ogy trans­fers, sub­si­dies, and other hid­den pro­tec­tion­ist bar­ri­ers that China in­sists upon in its trade prac­tices. Fair and eq­ui­table trade is now more im­por­tant than just more trade. And rec­i­proc­ity is now the key­word.</p>
    <p>GROW­ING IMPATIENCE</p>
    <p>That much be­came clear last week at the an­nual EU-China sum­mit. Ger­man Chan­cel­lor Merkel dreamt of mak­ing this year’s sum­mit a sem­i­nal event, the one encounter de­signed to re­set the re­la­tion­ship, partly be­cause she hosted it as Ger­many cur­rently holds the ro­tat­ing pres­i­dency of the EU, and partly be­cause she and other Euro­pean politi­cians per­suaded them­selves that Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and his of­fi­cials now un­der­stand the im­per­a­tive of do­ing some­thing to ad­dress Euro­pean con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, how­ever, the sum­mit was largely a flop; apart from re­peat­ing boil­er­plate phrases about the need for co­op­er­a­tion and an agree­ment to pro­tect the trade­marks of Euro­pean food prod­ucts that rep­re­sent only 2 per cent of Europe’s trade with China, Mr Xi of­fered no con­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing ir­ri­ta­tion of the EU to this lack of progress was ev­i­dent from the com­mu­nique it is­sued at the end of the sum­mit, which re­called “the im­por­tant com­mit­ments made at the 2019 EU-China Sum­mit and stressed the need for the im­ple­men­ta­tion of th­ese com­mit­ments in a dy­namic and re­sult-ori­ented man­ner as progress today is lim­ited”, the sort of “frank” lan­guage Euro­peans sel­dom used be­fore.</p>
    <p>And Mr Charles Michel, who runs the EU Coun­cil, the body that brings to­gether EU heads of states and gov­ern­ments, went even fur­ther, when he bluntly tweeted af­ter the sum­mit: “Talk­ing is not enough; it’s time to turn words into ac­tion and com­mit­ments into deeds.”</p>
    <p>Trade ten­sions are only likely to in­crease as China be­comes an in­dus­trial com­peti­tor to even Ger­many, Europe’s most ro­bust econ­omy. Ger­many’s share of world trade in me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing goods – one of its spe­cial­i­ties – shrank from around 20 per cent a decade ago to barely 16 per cent last year, while China’s share rose to 13.5 per cent from just 8 per cent over that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>And when it comes to cars, an­other Ger­man strength, it is China that leads on bat­tery de­vel­op­ment, which will ac­count for around half of the value of fu­ture elec­tric cars. Ger­man politi­cians are sud­denly be­ing re­minded that their big­gest sin­gle ex­port mar­ket out­side Europe is not China, but the US.</p>
    <p>THE IN­VIS­I­BLE ELE­PHANT</p>
    <p>None of this means that the Euro­peans are about to copy the US model of deal­ing with China through threats, boy­cotts or tar­iffs; the hope in Europe is that the “old con­ti­nent” may yet evolve a dif­fer­ent en­gage­ment pol­icy with Bei­jing, one that avoids con­fronta­tion on se­cu­rity mat­ters.</p>
    <p>But as the newly re­leased</p>
    <p>Ger­man pol­icy pa­per for the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, which the Ger­man am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore out­lined on th­ese pages over the week­end, makes clear, key Euro­pean coun­tries are now grap­pling with the long-term im­pli­ca­tions of their changed ap­proach.</p>
    <p>They ac­cept that their in­volve­ment in Asia is not just an op­tion but a must, and that there is more to Asia than just China. Un­doubt­edly, this is a reap­praisal long over­due.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion now is whether Ger­many and other Euro­pean coun­tries are pre­pared to go be­yond the gen­er­al­i­ties of their new stances. For, as Dr An­dreas Fulda, a Ger­man aca­demic spe­cial­is­ing on re­la­tions with China, points out – the re­cently re­leased Ger­man pol­icy pa­per</p>
    <p>“does not of­fer even a ten­ta­tive clue as to how Ger­many aims to ad­dress ex­ist­ing power im­bal­ances in the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it vaguely ar­tic­u­lates a de­sire for fur­ther en­gage­ment, with­out spec­i­fy­ing in what way, or what Euro­peans should do to coun­ter­act those who may wish to dis­turb Asian sta­bil­ity. In short, the “ele­phant in the room” re­mains in­vis­i­ble.</p>
    <p>Still, the trend from other key Euro­pean play­ers is un­mis­tak­able. The Bri­tish openly state that at least one of their air­craft car­ri­ers is likely to spend much of its time around the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, par­tic­i­pat­ing in naval ex­er­cises with other na­tions. And the French are a ma­jor arms sup­plier not only to In­dia, but also to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>And Bri­tain, France and Ger­many have put their sig­na­tures to a joint le­gal sub­mis­sion to the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, flatly con­tra­dict­ing Chi­nese sovereignt­y claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>The days when Euro­pean pol­icy to­wards Asia largely con­sisted of a set of poli­cies to­wards China, and when China was just a huge mar­ket with no strate­gic im­pli­ca­tions, are now over.</p>
    <p>China did not prove amenable to the con­cept of “change-through-trade”. But, para­dox­i­cally, it is the Euro­peans who are now be­ing changed by the re­al­i­ties of trade.</p>
