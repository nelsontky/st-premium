    <p>LON­DON • For­mer Fer­rari tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor Ross Brawn says 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix win­ner Max Ver­stap­pen re­minds him of For­mula One great Michael Schu­macher.</p>
    <p>Brawn mas­ter­minded the Ger­man’s record seven world cham­pi­onships with Benet­ton (1994, 1995) and Fer­rari (2000-04) and was team boss at Mercedes when he made his come­back from 2010-2012.</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen’s win for Red Bull on Sun­day lifted him to sec­ond in the cham­pi­onship af­ter five races, be­hind six-time cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton, end­ing the Sil­ver Ar­rows’ 100 per cent run this season.</p>
    <p>“Max was sim­ply sen­sa­tional at Sil­ver­stone. He re­minds me of Michael Schu­macher i n many ways. When you listen to his ra­dio, he’s clearly got spare ca­pac­ity,” said Brawn, now For­mula One man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for mo­tor­sport, of the Dutch driver.</p>
    <p>Sun­day’s win was the ninth of Ver­stap­pen’s ca­reer and the Bri­ton feels the 22-year-old, who is the youngest race win­ner in F1 his­tory, can only get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“The limit of the car is not the limit of Max Ver­stap­pen,” Brawn told the mo­tor sport’s web­site. “He is able to feel the sub­tlety of the car and re­spond per­fectly.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber Max’s early days in F1 where his speed was clear – he has now ma­tured into an ex­cep­tional rac­ing driver.</p>
    <p>“I loved his ra­dio, par­tic­u­larly when he said he didn’t want to ‘drive like a grandma’ when the team asked him to man­age his tyres. It shows huge con­fi­dence and a re­la­tion­ship in the team, which is very strong.”</p>
    <p>Nico Hulken­berg also made his mark as a stand-in for Rac­ing Point’s Ser­gio Perez in the past two races fol­low­ing the Mex­i­can’s pos­i­tive Covid-19 test. The ex­pe­ri­enced Ger­man, dropped by Re­nault last year, started third and fin­ished sev­enth and Brawn re­vealed how dif­fer­ent the Ger­man’s ca­reer might have been.</p>
    <p>“I al­most signed him years ago, when I was in charge at Mercedes. If Lewis hadn’t joined Mercedes when he did, Nico was our next choice,” he said. “I’ve al­ways re­spected Nico enor­mously as a driver. He’s a very strong driver who should be in F1.”</p>
    <p>Separately, six-time de­fend­ing con­struc­tors’ cham­pi­ons Mercedes have in­sisted they have done noth­ing wrong and are happy for a row over Rac­ing Point’s RP20 car to end up in court, ac­cord­ing to team boss Toto Wolff.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man car­maker sup­plies en­gines and gear­boxes to Rac­ing Point, whose car has been dubbed the “Pink Mercedes” due to its vis­ual sim­i­lar­i­ties to last year’s ti­tlewin­ner.</p>
    <p>Stew­ards have fined Rac­ing Point €400,000 (S$647,000) and docked them 15 points over their use of near iden­ti­cal rear brake ducts, af­ter com­plaints were raised by other teams.</p>
    <p>Ri­vals like Red Bull and Re­nault have also ques­tioned whether Mercedes erred in pro­vid­ing parts and in­for­ma­tion, but Wolff has since chal­lenged them to lodge a le­gal “protest”, claim­ing our “rep­u­ta­tion is in­tact”.</p>
