    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Most celebri­ties would an­nounce to the world their preg­nan­cies or ba­bies soon af­ter the birth, but not Amer­i­can ac­tress Mindy Kal­ing.</p>
    <p>The star of sit­com The Of­fice (2005 to 2013) and tele­vi­sion se­ries The Mindy Project (2012 to 2017) sur­prised her fans on Thurs­day on The Late Show With Stephen Col­bert when she re­vealed that her sec­ond child was born last month.</p>
    <p>“I’m telling it for the first time now, it feels so strange. But I gave birth to a baby boy on Sept 3,” the 41-year-old told Col­bert.</p>
    <p>“No one even knew you were preg­nant,” the TV host ex­claimed.</p>
    <p>“This is news to a lot of peo­ple,” Kal­ing said. “It’s true.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tress then added that her son’s name is Spencer, but did not di­vulge his father’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Kal­ing, who has al­ways kept her per­sonal life pri­vate, has a two-year-old daughter Kather­ine, whose face has never been shown on so­cial me­dia. The Ocean’s 8 (2018) star has also not re­vealed who the girl’s father is.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she did say Kather­ine’s god­fa­ther is ac­tor B.J. No­vak, with whom she had an on-off re­la­tion­ship af­ter they met on the set of The Of­fice in 2004.</p>
    <p>Kal­ing’s first pregnancy was made known only af­ter it was ac­ci­den­tally re­vealed by talk-show host Oprah Win­frey, her co-star in the movie A Wrin­kle In Time (2018), in an in­ter­view with Peo­ple mag­a­zine in July 2017.</p>
