    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are not feel­ing your best, but you can still get things done and have a good time with­out knock­ing any­one’s socks off with your wit.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You re­ceive good news from a friend who seems to get where you are com­ing from – see about work­ing to­gether in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You are jeal­ous of some­thing or some­one that does not feel firmly in your pos­ses­sion. Snap out of it be­fore things get too dark.</p>
    <p>Cancer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your in­tu­ition is stronger than ever and one big hunch is sure to pay off hand­somely for you, so act with con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy pushes you to com­pro­mise and to try to main­tain the good­will that has kept your peo­ple to­gether for this long.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You need some help – but for­tu­nately, it is al­ready on the way. Of course, you may be re­quired to pay back the favour.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your friends and fam­ily are there for you, even if all seems to have gone down­hill. You may find it eas­ier to call out for them now.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is height­ened, but you are at your best only if you are fo­cused on your needs and de­sires. Con­trol oth­ers at your peril.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You are ask­ing the ques­tions that keep oth­ers up at night, but are mostly just ex­cit­ing to you. See if you can fig­ure out what is go­ing on.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are up one mo­ment and down the next. Use the highs to get stuff done and the lows to think about what comes next.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Try not to let the neg­a­tive emo­tions roil­ing about in­side you ruin your schemes. You can make it through this phase.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your warm­est feel­ings are bub­bling. Share them with friends, fam­ily and whomever else de­serves a lit­tle love. You have enough to spare.</p>
