    <p>Home-grown singer JJ Lin, ac­tor Andie Chen and tele­vi­sion host Lee Teng were among the more than 140 celebri­ties who at­tended the three-day wake of Tai­wanese en­ter­tainer Alien Huang, which ended on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Lin, 39, went to the wake on Mon­day morn­ing with his friend, for­mer Da Mouth singer Harry Chang. They stayed for about 10 min­utes be­fore leav­ing.</p>
    <p>Lin told the me­dia that re­gret­fully, he did not have a chance to work on music with Huang. Lin’s agency said the two of them had been in dis­cus­sions on a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Huang’s AES streetwear brand and Lin’s SMG life­style brand.</p>
    <p>Both Lee and Chen, who costarred with Huang in Me­di­a­corp drama Joys Of Life (2012), went to the wake on Sun­day. Chen, who is in Tai­wan for work, told The Straits Times last week that he did not man­age to meet Huang as he was serv­ing his quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Huang, 36, was found dead at home last Wednes­day. An au­topsy con­cluded that he died of an aor­tic dis­sec­tion, which had l ed to a block­age of his blood ves­sels.</p>
    <p>An aor­tic dis­sec­tion is a lifethreat­en­ing con­di­tion which oc­curs when the in­ner layer of the aorta – the large blood ves­sel branch­ing off the heart – tears.</p>
    <p>Other celebri­ties who at­tended the wake in­cluded singer Richie Jen, ac­tor Chen Bo-lin, tele­vi­sion host Mickey Huang, his wife ac­tress Sum­mer Meng, singer Jam Hsiao, May­day leader Mon­ster and singer Cyndi Wang.</p>
    <p>Alien Huang’s girl­friend, cheer­leader Wu Han-chun, whom he had been dat­ing in se­cret for the past 11/ years, was there for the three days.</p>
    <p>His good friend, ac­tress Ann Hsu, was there for the whole du­ra­tion of the wake as well.</p>
    <p>His for­mer girl­friend, singer</p>
    <p>Rainie Yang, went for a sec­ond time on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese me­dia es­ti­mated that more than 4,500 fans at­tended the wake.</p>
    <p>Huang’s man­ager Dino told the me­dia that his music memo­rial is sched­uled for Oct 6.</p>
    <p>His la­bel will an­nounce de­tails later this week. (right) in­cluded</p>
