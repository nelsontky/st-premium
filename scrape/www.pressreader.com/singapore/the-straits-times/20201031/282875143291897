    <p>In the wake of Covid-19, when it is com­mon to work from home, more peo­ple have been snap­ping up er­gonomic chairs for their home of­fices.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one is con­tent with a reg­u­lar of­fice chair, which can look out of place with the ex­ist­ing set-up.</p>
    <p>Fur­ni­ture re­tail­ers say more are splash­ing out on state­ment pieces that can cost up to a few thou­sand dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Mrs Rhi­an­non Hills, manag­ing di­rec­tor of Dan­ish De­sign Co at B&D Build­ing in Pasir Pan­jang, has seen an uptick in de­mand for high-qual­ity and com­fort­able fur­ni­ture dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“There has been a de­mand surge for er­gonomic desk chairs as well as clas­sic lounge chairs. A state­ment lounge chair in­stantly adds a touch of elegance to a space and lends a fo­cal point to a well-de­signed room.”</p>
    <p>Some lounge chairs that have been snapped up in­clude the Span­ish Chair, priced from about $8,000, and Stingray Lounge Chair, which costs about $4,000. Both are by Dan­ish la­bel Fred­eri­cia.</p>
    <p>Her com­pany car­ries pieces from the clas­sic mid­cen­tury mod­ern pe­riod dur­ing the Dan­ish De­sign Move­ment (1933 to 1965) to present-day award­win­ning de­sign­ers. Its show­room re­tails re­cent it­er­a­tions of iconic chairs such as Finn Juhl’s Chief­tain Chair, Arne Ja­cob­sen’s Egg Chair and Hans J. Weg­ner’s Ox and Shell chairs.</p>
    <p>W. Ate­lier, which also of­fers Scan­di­na­vian clas­sics, has seen a spike in de­mand for state­ment chairs in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Magg, gen­eral man­ager of the fur­ni­ture di­vi­sion, says the store recorded a 200 to 300 per cent growth in sales for home of­fice equip­ment dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and the de­mand has not abated.</p>
    <p>“We’ve also seen a big jump of 40 per cent in sales of our clas­sic Scan­di­na­vian chairs such as The Egg and PK22 from Fritz Hansen,” he adds.</p>
    <p>So what makes a clas­sic or state­ment chair? “A clas­sic chair is usu­ally al­ready suc­cess­ful at the time of its in­cep­tion and per­ceived as an in­no­va­tion of its time,” says Mr Magg, 46. “It be­comes a clas­sic when it stands the test of time in terms of com­fort, looks and er­gonomics.”</p>
    <p>He cites the sculp­tural Egg chair by Ja­cob­sen and the PK22 lounge chair by Poul Kjaer­holm – both were first de­signed in the 1950s and are re­pro­duced ev­ery year by Dan­ish fur­ni­ture-maker Fritz Hansen – as must-haves for a well-cu­rated home.</p>
    <p>“The Egg and Swan Chairs by Ja­cob­sen from Fritz Hansen and the Stan­dard Chair by Jean Prouve from (Swiss fur­ni­ture maker) Vi­tra are ex­am­ples of iconic pieces that have made their mark in mod­ern fur­ni­ture his­tory,” he says.</p>
    <p>W. Ate­lier stocks mainly con­tem­po­rary fur­ni­ture pieces with a smaller se­lec­tion – about a quar­ter of to­tal stocks – re­served for mid-cen­tury mod­ern pieces, which in­clude iconic pieces from Fritz Hansen and Vi­tra such as the Egg and Stan­dard chairs.</p>
    <p>Ms Lynette Wong, an avid col­lec­tor of Scan­di­na­vian ar­ti­sanal fur­ni­ture and founder of 1B2G Fine Vin­tage Fur­ni­ture, be­lieves in the power of a state­ment piece.</p>
    <p>“It can trans­form a space be­cause ev­ery piece has a story to tell,” says Ms Wong, who is in her 50s.</p>
    <p>Her show­room at Tan Boon Liat Build­ing in Ou­tram Road stocks mainly vin­tage Nordic de­sign pieces dat­ing back to the 1930s. Iconic chairs by Dan­ish de­sign­ers Weg­ner and Ib Ko­fod-Larsen are priced be­tween $20,000 and $48,000 at her store.</p>
    <p>“I go for the Dan­ish mod­ern big guns such as Juhl, Poul Kjaer­holm and Weg­ner and also the big ‘C’, which refers to best pos­si­ble con­di­tion,” says Ms Wong, adding that if a piece is bought di­rectly from the de­signer or the de­signer’s fam­ily, its value ap­pre­ci­ates ex­po­nen­tially.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong, who has been col­lect­ing Nordic fur­ni­ture for more than a decade, says peo­ple of­ten mix up the terms “mod­ern” and “con­tem­po­rary”.</p>
    <p>“The mod­ern pe­riod is from the early to mid-20th cen­tury, with roots in Scan­di­na­vian de­sign,” she says. “From mod­ern came mid-cen­tury mod­ern – from the 1950s to the 1970s – that sweet spot that co­in­cides with the golden era of Dan­ish de­sign which gave us Juhl, Weg­ner, Ja­cob­sen and Poul Hen­ningsen.”</p>
    <p>This era also in­spired fur­ni­ture-makers in other parts of the world, in­clud­ing Amer­i­can brand Knoll, which has been de­sign­ing its own mod­ern pieces since the 1950s such as the Womb and Tulip chairs.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the 1970s, Ms Wong says, came con­tem­po­rary de­sign, “which refers to pieces from the year 2000 to the present day.</p>
    <p>But Mrs Hills says state­ment chairs do not have to be old to be col­lectible. “Some con­tem­po­rary chairs are slowly be­com­ing de­sign icons, such as the Bee­tle Chair by Gam­Fratesi de­signed in 2013.”</p>
    <p>Gam­Fratesi, based in Copen­hagen, Den­mark, is a de­sign stu­dio helmed by award-win­ning Dan­ish ar­chi­tect Stine Gam and Ital­ian ar­chi­tect En­rico Fratesi.</p>
    <p>While clas­sic fur­ni­ture does not come cheap, Mr Magg says you do not have to break the bank to own an iconic piece.</p>
    <p>Clas­sics such as the Ant Chair, Pan­ton Chair and Se­ries 7 Chair re­tail for be­low $1,000 at his store.</p>
    <p>“Start with one item and build the col­lec­tion over time,” he says.</p>
    <p>Home-grown fur­ni­ture re­tailer Castlery de­signs its own con­tem­po­rary clas­sics, but be­lieves that state­ment pieces need not cost the earth. Its fab­ric and leather arm­chairs are priced from about $300 to $500.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, its Am­ber state­ment arm­chair – a cur­va­ceous piece made of tex­tured boucle fab­ric that al­lows the user to swivel 360 de­grees while co­cooned in its semi-cir­cu­lar back­rest – costs $499.</p>
    <p>Co-founder De­clan Ee and the com­pany’s de­sign­ers – a mix of Sin­ga­pore­ans, Aus­tralians and Euro­peans – em­brace the pared-down aes­thetic of mod­ernism.</p>
    <p>“I love the in­no­va­tion and cre­ativ­ity in the fur­ni­ture in­dus­try in re­cent years – the 21st-cen­tury de­signs from the likes of Kon­stantin Gr­cic’s Chair_One to Gam­Fratesi’s Bee­tle Lounge Chair, which are great ex­am­ples of state­ment pieces,” says Mr Ee, 38.</p>
    <p>A fan of the mod­ern move­ment is Dr Sue-Anne Toh, in her 40s, who col­lects state­ment chairs by Fritz Hansen. She is drawn to how the pieces are “in­cred­i­bly sim­ple and min­i­mal”.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive, founder and med­i­cal di­rec­tor of Novi Health, a multi-dis­ci­plinary med­i­cal prac­tice and healthtech com­pany, says: “State­ment chairs marry form and func­tion and are able to with­stand the test of time.”</p>
