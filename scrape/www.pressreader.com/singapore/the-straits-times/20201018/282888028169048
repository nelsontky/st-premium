    <p>Many work­ers would agree heartily with labour MP Melvin Yong’s pro­posal in Par­lia­ment for a “Right to Dis­con­nect” law that would help em­ploy­ees have pro­tected time to rest and recharge. That right would no doubt help ad­dress is­sues such as burnout and lead to safer work­places. French leg­is­la­tion, for ex­am­ple, re­quires em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees to ne­go­ti­ate the pro­to­col for non-emer­gency calls and non-crit­i­cal e-mails, out­side of work­ing hours. That reg­u­la­tory frame­work is par­al­leled by the Ger­man prac­tice of “Feier­abend”, which de­scribes the time af­ter the work day ends and when rest time be­gins.</p>
    <p>Al­though there is no ev­i­dence to sug­gest that Sin­ga­pore work­ers are at risk of karoshi, the Ja­panese term for death by over­work, no one would want Sin­ga­pore to get to the point where oc­cu­pa­tional sud­den mor­tal­ity would de­mand of­fi­cial in­ter­ven­tion. It would be far bet­ter if the need to leg­is­late work­ers’ need for rest – which could go too far be­cause dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries have dif­fer­ent needs – were to be pre-empted in­stead by com­pa­nies them­selves.</p>
    <p>Act­ing in their en­light­ened self-in­ter­est, com­pa­nies and bosses should recog­nise that a rested work­force will be a more pro­duc­tive one. They should heed the find­ings of a 2014 study by Stan­ford Univer­sity in the United States, cited in Par­lia­ment, which found that over­work­ing, or work­ing be­yond 55 hours a week, caused a sharp de­cline in pro­duc­tiv­ity per hour, and led to more work­place ac­ci­dents and in­juries. Surely, that is not the way to go. At the end of the day, the cor­po­rate man­age­ment of em­ploy­ees’ time should be a mat­ter of cus­tom me­di­ated by oc­ca­sional ur­gency. Emer­gen­cies by def­i­ni­tion dis­rupt es­tab­lished pat­terns of time de­voted to work. But emer­gen­cies can­not be­come the norm. Em­ploy­ers owe it to them­selves, as much as they do to their em­ploy­ees, to fol­low fair work timeta­bles.</p>
