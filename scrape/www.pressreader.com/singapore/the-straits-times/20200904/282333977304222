    <p>(Italy) For­mer Fer­rari pres­i­dent Luca di Mon­teze­molo has blamed the Ital­ian team’s man­age­ment for their own poor form and the bun­gled de­par­ture of four­time cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vet­tel, who is set to leave the team at the end of this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ahead of Sun­day’s Ital­ian Grand Prix, in which the team are ex­pected to find it hard to avoid an­other un­com­pet­i­tive week­end, the Ital­ian said the Ger­man driver car­ried no blame for his and the team’s strug­gles.</p>
    <p>He added that Fer­rari were not pre­pared for the sport’s move to hy­brid turbo en­gines in 2014.</p>
    <p>The man who or­gan­ised Italy’s host­ing of the 1990 World Cup and led Fer­rari through the glory years of suc­cess with Michael Schu­macher told broad­caster RTL that Vet­tel had lacked sup­port in his six years with the Scud­e­ria.</p>
    <p>He said: “He has never caused any prob­lems and al­ways works from the team point of view. And he has won many races that other driv­ers would not have won.</p>
    <p>“I am there­fore not happy with the way Vet­tel has been treated. The tim­ing was not right and the way it was done was cer­tainly not right.”</p>
    <p>Ref­er­enc­ing his ear­lier days as team man­ager un­der Enzo Fer­rari, di Mon­teze­molo said: “Those driv­ers need an en­vi­ron­ment where they feel at home and sup­ported.</p>
    <p>“That was the case with Michael when Jean Todt was at the helm and I did it with Niki Lauda.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Claire Wil­liams, For­mula One’s only fe­male team boss, will step down af­ter the Ital­ian race, Wil­liams an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton ef­fec­tively ran the team de­spite be­ing of­fi­cially the deputy to her 78-year-old fa­ther Frank, who no longer at­tends races and is also leav­ing fol­low­ing the sale to Do­ril­ton Cap­i­tal last month.</p>
    <p>Wil­liams, who have not won a race since 2012 and are cur­rently last in the stand­ings with­out a point, will keep their name go­ing into next sea­son, but the fam­ily’s de­par­ture marks the end of an era af­ter 43 years and 739 grands prix.</p>
