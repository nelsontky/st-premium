    <p>MEL­BOURNE • The Vic­to­ria state gov­ern­ment is con­fi­dent the Aus­tralian Open will go ahead, but of­fered no as­sur­ances yes­ter­day that play­ers would be al­lowed to ar­rive in time for the sea­son-open­ing ATP Cup and other events in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The ATP Tour told play­ers on Tues­day that the start of the next sea­son re­mained up in the air due to “chal­lenges” in Aus­tralia, which is ef­fec­tively closed to in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis Aus­tralia (TA) planned for play­ers and their en­tourages to ar­rive in Vic­to­ria next month to have time to un­der­take a manda­tory two-week quar­an­tine pe­riod be­fore com­pet­ing in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>But Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews ques­tioned whether play­ers needed to ar­rive so early and said that the state gov­ern­ment was still work­ing with TA on quar­an­tine ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Ten­nis Chan­nel, the au­thor­i­ties will not al­low play­ers to ar­rive in the mid­dle of next month and the BBC cor­rob­o­rated that re­port, with the de­ci­sion “un­likely to change”.</p>
    <p>“(Ten­nis Aus­tralia) are work­ing (with) all of their part­ners and we’re con­fi­dent that we’ll fin­ish up with an Aus­tralian Open,” An­drews told re­porters. “Whether (play­ers) need to be here in De­cem­ber is the other is­sue.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if that nec­es­sar­ily means there isn’t an Aus­tralian Open.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Open is sched­uled to start on Jan 18 at Mel­bourne Park, but dates for the team-based ATP Cup and other events that lead into the year’s first Grand Slam have yet to be fixed.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, top-ranked No­vak Djokovic said he did not know if he would be able to lead Ser­bia’s ti­tle de­fence at the ATP Cup.</p>
    <p>The ATP said it was work­ing “as hard as pos­si­ble” to de­liver the cal­en­dar of events.</p>
    <p>TA de­clined to com­ment but chief ex­ec­u­tive Craig Ti­ley told lo­cal me­dia ear­lier this week that the gov­ern­ing body had de­cided to shift the ATP Cup and all other do­mes­tic tour­na­ments to Vic­to­ria in Jan­uary to mit­i­gate the risk of lo­gis­ti­cal is­sues aris­ing from Covid-19 pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his plans have since been given short shrift by Mr An­drews, who said his gov­ern­ment had not even signed off on the Slam, let alone al­low­ing play­ers to prac­tise while in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the BBC, the hard­court Ma­jor could be de­layed by a week or two to al­low for the warmup events to go ahead as planned, although that will re­sult in a sched­ul­ing con­flict with other tour­na­ments in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has largely brought Covid-19 to heel, with Vic­to­ria record­ing no new cases for nearly three weeks, but a fresh out­break in Ade­laide has alarmed of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>World No. 2 Rafa Nadal feels ar­riv­ing later in Aus­tralia would not be a “big dif­fer­ence” as long as play­ers can train while in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“The only neg­a­tive thing is we have to be there like 16 days in ad­vance (of com­pet­ing),” he told re­porters at the ATP Fi­nals on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>(Ten­nis Aus­tralia) are work­ing (with) all of their part­ners and we’re con­fi­dent that we’ll fin­ish up with an Aus­tralian Open. Whether (play­ers) need to be here in De­cem­ber is the other is­sue.</p>
    <p>DANIEL AN­DREWS, Vic­to­ria Premier.</p>
