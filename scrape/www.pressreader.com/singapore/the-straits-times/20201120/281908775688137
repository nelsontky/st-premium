    <p>•</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son yesterday pushed back over a list of more than a dozen griev­ances raised by China re­gard­ing his coun­try’s hu­man rights diplo­macy, in­de­pen­dent media and in­vest­ment poli­cies, saying “we will al­ways be Aus­tralia”.</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese of­fi­cial gave a dossier to Aus­tralian media con­tain­ing 14 griev­ances, high­light­ing the in­creas­ingly frac­tious re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two na­tions. “If you make China the en­emy, China will be the en­emy,” a Chi­nese gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial re­port­edly told three prom­i­nent out­lets on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Among the com­plaints are Aus­tralia’s strict for­eign in­ter­fer­ence laws, the coun­try’s ban on Huawei’s in­volve­ment in its 5G network and de­ci­sions that blocked Chi­nese in­vest­ment projects on “na­tional se­cu­rity grounds”.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said the “un­of­fi­cial doc­u­ment” came from the Chi­nese em­bassy and would not stop Aus­tralia from set­ting “our own laws and our own rules ac­cord­ing to our na­tional in­ter­est”.</p>
    <p>“We won’t be com­pro­mis­ing on the fact that we will set what our for­eign in­vest­ment laws are or how we build our 5G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­works or how we run our sys­tems of pro­tect­ing against in­ter­fer­ence in (the) way we run our coun­try,” he told Chan­nel Nine TV.</p>
    <p>“If this is the cause for ten­sion in that re­la­tion­ship, then it would seem that the ten­sion is that Aus­tralia is just be­ing Aus­tralia,” Mr</p>
    <p>Mor­ri­son said in an in­ter­view with the Seven Network.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ment also claimed Can­berra had en­gaged in “in­ces­sant wan­ton in­ter­fer­ence” in China’s af­fairs while sin­gling out Aus­tralia’s call for an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>It ac­cused Aus­tralia of “sid­ing with the US’ anti-China cam­paign and spread­ing dis­in­for­ma­tion” about where the virus orig­i­nated – a par­tic­u­larly sore point for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The United States weighed in on the diplo­matic rift yesterday, with the White House Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil saying on Twit­ter that “Bei­jing is up­set Aus­tralia took steps to ex­pose and thwart Chi­nese es­pi­onage & to pro­tect Aussie sovereignt­y”.</p>
    <p>“It’s en­cour­ag­ing to see a grow­ing num­ber of coun­tries fol­low­ing Can­berra’s lead in tak­ing such steps,” the tweet con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Aus­tralia and Ja­pan</p>
    <p>We won’t be com­pro­mis­ing on the fact that we will set what our for­eign in­vest­ment laws are or how we build our 5G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­works or how we run our sys­tems of pro­tect­ing against in­ter­fer­ence in (the) way we run our coun­try. agreed on a break­through de­fence pact during a visit by Mr Mor­ri­son to Tokyo, prompt­ing a re­buke from China over state­ments the Aus­tralian leader and Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga made.</p>
    <p>Back in Aus­tralia, Mr Mor­ri­son told media it was a mis­take for China to be­lieve Aus­tralia acted at the be­hest of the US. He said Aus­tralia formed trade and de­fence ar­range­ments with Ja­pan and other coun­tries, and set its for­eign in­vest­ment rules, in ac­cor­dance with its na­tional in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween Can­berra and Bei­jing have reached a new low in re­cent months, leav­ing Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment min­is­ters un­able to per­suade Chi­nese coun­ter­parts to even ac­cept their phone calls.</p>
    <p>The rift has left Aus­tralian ex­porters ex­posed as their largest trad­ing part­ner places a se­ries of re­tal­ia­tory bans on agri­cul­tural goods in­clud­ing beef, bar­ley and tim­ber.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing is just grad­u­ally ratch­et­ing up the pres­sure,” said Lowy In­sti­tute se­nior fel­low Richard McGre­gor, adding that the tim­ing was not good for China’s speeches about trade open­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Maude, a se­nior fel­low at New York-based think-tank Asia So­ci­ety Pol­icy In­sti­tute, said China was try­ing to get a change in Aus­tralia’s ap­proach, try­ing to po­larise the Aus­tralian po­lit­i­cal sys­tem on China pol­icy set­tings, and also send­ing a sig­nal in­ter­na­tion­ally. He said the griev­ance list was “to­tally tone deaf, and not ac­cept­ing they have any re­spon­si­bil­ity for the state of the re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>“The best chance for the Aus­tralia-China re­la­tion­ship to set­tle down is if (US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe) Bi­den finds a model for man­aged com­pe­ti­tion with China,” Mr Maude, a for­mer Aus­tralian diplo­mat, added.</p>
