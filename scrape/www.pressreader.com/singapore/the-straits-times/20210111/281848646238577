    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment has in­creased the num­ber of spe­cial lottery draws to be car­ried out by gam­bling firms this year, de­spite the anti-gam­bling stance of Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS), which is part of the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coalition.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a year in which coro­n­avirus pan­demic-fu­elled re­stric­tions se­verely ham­pered the na­tional econ­omy, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s gov­ern­ment, which is dom­i­nated by MalayMus­lim par­ties, re­in­stated the num­ber of spe­cial draws to 22 in a cal­en­dar year. This is markedly higher than the num­ber of draws al­lowed by the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>A sen­a­tor from the op­po­si­tion Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), Mr Liew Chin Tong, raised the mat­ter in the Malaysian Se­nate re­cently, and urged the gov­ern­ment to re­duce the num­ber of spe­cial draws in or­der to min­imise so­cial ills caused by gam­bling.</p>
    <p>Gam­bling is pro­hib­ited in Is­lam, and tax rev­enue col­lected from the ac­tiv­ity, as well as from to­bacco and al­co­hol sales, is de­fined as sin tax.</p>
    <p>The con­tri­bu­tion of the gam­bling in­dus­try to Malaysia’s sin tax has been in­creas­ing over the years. Be­tween 2008 and 2012, the gov­ern­ment col­lected an av­er­age of RM1.26 bil­lion (S$413 mil­lion) a year from the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In 2019, for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng re­vealed that sin tax from gam­bling ac­tiv­i­ties in the pre­ced­ing year amounted to RM4.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial lottery draws, which are in ad­di­tion to the reg­u­lar three draws per week, nor­mally in­volve a much larger win­ner’s pot.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment im­poses an ex­tra tax on those buy­ing spe­cial draw tick­ets, on top of the reg­u­lar gam­bling tax.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial draws were first in­tro­duced in 1999, dur­ing the premier­ship of Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, with the tax pro­ceeds con­tribut­ing to a fund to help those af­fected by the 1998 Ni­pah virus out­break.</p>
    <p>The draws – on 22 Tues­days a year – stayed the same for the next two decades.</p>
    <p>But when the PH gov­ern­ment, which was also led by Dr Ma­hathir, won fed­eral power in 2018, the draws were re­duced to 11 in 2019, and eight last year.</p>
    <p>The DAP, which forms part of PH, has con­sis­tently spo­ken out against the spe­cial draws, and on how they could lead to gam­bling ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial draws con­trib­uted RM80 mil­lion in ex­tra rev­enue for the gov­ern­ment in 1999. The rev­enue reached a high of RM238 mil­lion in 2017, and av­er­aged RM200 mil­lion a year in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew’s rev­e­la­tions in the Se­nate saw sev­eral lead­ers from Is­lamist party PAS im­me­di­ately ob­ject­ing to the in­crease in spe­cial draws. PAS, which gov­erns Ke­lan­tan, has banned any form of gam­bling in the state.</p>
    <p>PAS sen­a­tor Khairil Nizam Khirudin said par­ties should work to­gether to erad­i­cate gam­bling.</p>
    <p>“We in­vite lead­ers from DAP and other par­ties in Pakatan Hara­pan or Perikatan Na­sional to elim­i­nate all gam­bling ac­tiv­i­ties in Malaysia al­to­gether,” Mr Khairil said on Jan 2.</p>
    <p>Still, this may not be a burn­ing is­sue for the Is­lamist party.</p>
    <p>Bow­erGroup Asia di­rec­tor As­rul Hadi Ab­dul­lah Sani said that the party is will­ing to be more prag­matic while be­ing in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“I do not think this will be a ma­jor is­sue or an is­sue at all dur­ing the elec­tion. The­o­ret­i­cally, spe­cial draws only af­fect the non-Mus­lim com­mu­nity, and the is­sue would not sig­nif­i­cantly im­pact the ru­ral Malay vot­ers,” Mr As­rul Hadi said.</p>
    <p>$78m</p>
    <p>Amount of ex­tra rev­enue – the equiv­a­lent of RM238 mil­lion – that spe­cial draws con­trib­uted to the Malaysian gov­ern­ment in 2017. $1.5b</p>
    <p>The equiv­a­lent of RM4.5 bil­lion in sin tax from gam­bling ac­tiv­i­ties in 2018.</p>
