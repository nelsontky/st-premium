    <p>Col­lec­tive sale ac­tiv­i­ties typ­i­cally take place over short and in­ten­sive cy­cles, when­ever de­vel­op­ers’ ap­petite for land sur­passes sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Their ap­petite for land surges when their in­ven­tory runs low and the out­look for the mar­ket turns pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Both of th­ese fac­tors are now in play on the back of stronger-than-ex­pected new homes sales this year, de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sta­ple land source comes from the Gov­ern­ment Land Sales pro­gramme, which gen­er­ates a steady stream of new res­i­den­tial projects each year.</p>
    <p>When­ever de­vel­op­ers cu­mu­la­tively switch to land-buy­ing mode, as we ex­pect to see in 2021-2022, the surge in de­mand tends to sur­pass the Gov­ern­ment’s planned sup­ply, thereby un­lock­ing the ar­bi­trage for col­lec­tive sales to take place.</p>
    <p>The 2017-2018 pe­riod saw a strong bull run for col­lec­tive sales, with some 70 projects suc­cess­fully sold en bloc for a to­tal of $19 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>For every suc­cess­ful sale, there were more that were un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>Is now a good time to re­ac­ti­vate those pre­vi­ous col­lec­tive sale at­tempts? What fac­tors and best prac­tices should own­ers con­sider in or­der to in­crease their chances of suc­cess?</p>
    <p>Col­lec­tive sale ac­tiv­ity has prac­ti­cally ground to a stand­still since the last set of cool­ing mea­sures in July 2018, which short-cir­cuited the surge by in­creas­ing the stamp du­ties that de­vel­op­ers had to pay when ac­quir­ing res­i­den­tial land by 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the penalty im­posed on de­vel­op­ers that failed to sell all the hous­ing units in their new de­vel­op­ment within five years of pur­chas­ing the land was raised – from 15 per cent of the land pur­chase price to 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>While col­lec­tive sale ac­tiv­ity is ex­pected to im­prove next year, we do not ex­pect the next wave to be as wide­spread or as strong as the last cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, two types of es­tates may need to wait this out.</p>
    <p>Large-scale projects that are ca­pa­ble of yield­ing over 1,000 new dwelling units will still find them­selves dis­ad­van­taged by the July 2018 cool­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers’ risks for such sites have es­ca­lated ex­po­nen­tially as the rules im­pose the same five-year time­frame to sell the new homes ir­re­spec­tive of the project size.</p>
    <p>Projects in the mid-prime to high-end seg­ment of the res­i­den­tial space, where the sale prices of new homes hover above $2,500 per sq ft, may also wish to wait out this cy­cle.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, there ap­pears to be am­ple sup­ply of new homes in this cat­e­gory, rel­a­tive to the size of the pop­u­la­tion that can af­ford them.</p>
    <p>Still, the mar­ket is cycli­cal and the tide will even­tu­ally turn.</p>
    <p>Sites lo­cated a short walk from MRT sta­tions have an ev­er­green ap­peal. In­creas­ingly, so do sites in close prox­im­ity to en­hanced park con­nec­tor net­works, as th­ese have helped make cy­cling – which has seen a surge in pop­u­lar­ity since the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod – a vi­able al­ter­na­tive mode of short-dis­tance com­mute.</p>
    <p>Among the many de­vel­op­ments that have at­tempted a sale, less than one in three was suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>The main rea­sons for the failed at­tempts are un­re­al­is­tic re­serve prices, or the col­lec­tive sale was fun­da­men­tally not vi­able in the first place. Some vi­able ones may have started the process too late in the cy­cle when the mar­ket was on the de­cline.</p>
    <p>It may be help­ful to con­sult ex­pe­ri­enced property con­sul­tants on the vi­a­bil­ity and tim­ing of ini­ti­at­ing an ex­er­cise. When ap­point­ing a property con­sul­tant and law firm, the key cri­te­ria in­clude ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge, com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills and fees.</p>
    <p>More of­ten than not, own­ers re­gard the property con­sul­tant’s rec­om­mended re­serve price as the key de­ter­min­ing fac­tor, which leads to un­re­al­is­tic and se­duc­tive pitches. Do not fall for that.</p>
    <p>On the ad­vice of the ap­pointed property con­sul­tant and lawyer, it is im­por­tant to de­ter­mine the right min­i­mum price level, based on care­ful as­sess­ment of the property’s rede­vel­op­ment po­ten­tial, mar­ketabil­ity and level of in­ter­est from the own­ers. Fac­tors af­fect­ing the value of the property, such as the de­vel­op­ment base­line, should be de­ter­mined early.</p>
    <p>PRE­MI­UMS MAY BE TRIMMED</p>
    <p>Although the col­lec­tive sale ex­er­cise may main­tain the same re­serve price as pre­vi­ous at­tempts, math­e­mat­i­cally, the pre­mi­ums may be lower. This is be­cause the base re­sale val­ues tend to rise af­ter a failed sale at­tempt.</p>
    <p>Un­less land prices rise sig­nif­i­cantly, de­vel­op­ers may trim their of­fers to fac­tor the ad­di­tional 5 per cent stamp duty as costs.</p>
    <p>The Method of Ap­por­tion­ment is of­ten a con­tentious is­sue, es­pe­cially for projects with di­verse unit types or sizes.</p>
    <p>Three key fac­tors used to ar­rive at the best meth­ods are strata area, share value and mar­ket val­u­a­tion. There is no one-size-fits-all for­mula.</p>
    <p>The golden rule is to en­sure that all own­ers en­joy as equal a per­cent­age pre­mium as pos­si­ble when mea­sured against their re­spec­tive typ­i­cal val­ues. If a val­u­a­tion re­port is needed to de­ter­mine the best dis­tri­bu­tion for­mula, own­ers should share the costs of as­cer­tain­ing this.</p>
    <p>Aris­ing from safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, elec­tronic means of con­duct­ing meet­ings for col­lec­tive sales have been per­mit­ted un­til June 30 next year. With the grow­ing ac­cep­tance of vir­tual meet­ings, we be­lieve there are mer­its in al­low­ing this on a per­ma­nent ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Paper­less and dig­i­tal up­dates, elec­tronic sur­veys, min­utes of meet­ings and no­tices, and dig­i­tal sign­ing of the col­lec­tive sale agree­ment may even be pos­si­ble in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Two types of es­tates may need to wait this cy­cle out.</p>
    <p>Large-scale projects that are ca­pa­ble of yield­ing over 1,000 new dwelling units will still find them­selves dis­ad­van­taged by the July 2018 cool­ing mea­sures... Projects in the mid-prime to high-end seg­ment of the res­i­den­tial space... may also wish to wait out this cy­cle. There ap­pears to be am­ple sup­ply of new homes in this cat­e­gory, rel­a­tive to the size of the pop­u­la­tion that can af­ford them.</p>
