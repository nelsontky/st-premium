    <p>In April, when Covid-19 in­fec­tions showed no signs of abat­ing, and the ev­i­dence was grow­ing in favour of wear­ing face masks to pre­vent trans­mis­sions, it be­came com­pul­sory for ev­ery­one to don one that cov­ered their mouths and noses as long as they were not at home.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple soon learnt that the authoritie­s meant busi­ness when those who, for what­ever rea­son, did not have a mask on faced fines.</p>
    <p>And after sev­eral ugly in­ci­dents, mask wear­ing, and habits like hand-wash­ing and stand­ing 1m apart, be­came a fea­ture of daily life.</p>
    <p>But as the pan­demic drags on, the re­solve to com­ply with these mea­sures has be­gun to fal­ter.</p>
    <p>Dr Annabelle Chow, prin­ci­pal clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist at Annabelle Psy­chol­ogy, told The Straits Times in Septem­ber that con­tin­ual ex­po­sure to Covid-19 news and ad­vi­sories could de­sen­si­tise peo­ple to their im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey con­ducted by ST that month of 1,000 re­spon­dents found that 44 per cent were tired of fol­low­ing nec­es­sary health mea­sures such as wear­ing a mask, check­ing in with SafeEn­try and lim­it­ing the size of phys­i­cal gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, mask wear­ing was also found to cause acne and ir­ri­ta­tion dubbed “maskne”, a re­sult of heat build­ing up in­side the mask, as well as chaf­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Eileen Tan, a der­ma­tol­o­gist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hospi­tal, said she was see­ing ap­prox­i­mately 15 per cent to 20 per cent more com­plaints re­lated to mask wear­ing, which in­volved eczema, acne and skin in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Some pa­tients had se­verely dry and itchy skin be­cause of hav­ing to wear a mask for pro­longed pe­ri­ods, like health­care work­ers had to do.</p>
    <p>The sheer num­ber of dis­pos­able masks in use also posed a ques­tion mark for plas­tics pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>A study pub­lished in the En­vi­ron­men­tal Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy jour­nal in June es­ti­mated that 129 bil­lion dis­pos­able face masks were used across the world ev­ery month through­out the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mask de­bris, la­tex gloves and other forms of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) have be­gun show­ing up in oceans, sound­ing the alarm among con­ser­va­tion­ists and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGO) around the world.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, French NGO Op­er­a­tion Mer Pro­pre, which picks up lit­ter along the Cote d’Azur, be­gan find­ing such waste float­ing in the Mediter­ranean Sea as early as May.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, five to six masks have been found dur­ing each clean-up or­gan­ised by en­vi­ron­men­tal vol­un­teer groups at lo­cal parks, beaches and wa­ter­ways.</p>
    <p>While it is not yet known whether the PPE lit­ter from the pan­demic will in­crease the vol­ume of plas­tic waste, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Fed­erico Lauro from the Sin­ga­pore Cen­tre for En­vi­ron­men­tal Life Sciences En­gi­neer­ing at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity said it is likely that the use of plas­tics has gone up be­cause of shifts in con­sumer be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, aside from mask us­age, peo­ple have come to de­pend on food de­liv­er­ies, which will in­crease the use of plas­tic bags and con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>While there is far less plas­tic con­tent in a mask, mask lit­ter will still add to the plas­tic de­bris in the oceans, which will take a long time to de­grade, said Prof Lauro.</p>
    <p>“And as these tiny frag­ments of plas­tic are be­ing in­gested by ma­rine fish and in­ver­te­brates, its chem­i­cal com­po­nents may ac­cu­mu­late through the food chain. As a re­sult, we may end up eat­ing our dis­pos­able masks for din­ner,” he added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is un­de­ni­able that mask wear­ing has played its part in bring­ing the trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity to close to zero.</p>
    <p>In fact, it has also served to pro­tect peo­ple from in­fluenza this year.</p>
    <p>Poly­clin­ics are see­ing close to a quar­ter of the num­ber of pa­tients for acute re­s­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions (ARI) that they did last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health’s Weekly In­fec­tious Dis­ease Bul­letin, there was a daily av­er­age of 784 pa­tients seek­ing treat­ment for ARI from Dec 13 to Dec 19, com­pared with 3,050 pa­tients last year.</p>
    <p>Among those seek­ing treat­ment, none has tested pos­i­tive for the flu since June.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said masks, when worn prop­erly, also halt the trans­mis­sion of the rhi­novirus, parain­fluenza, ade­n­ovirus and sev­eral other types of coro­n­aviruses.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is “hard to tell” if these height­ened hy­giene habits will per­sist in the long term, he said.</p>
    <p>“One of the main rea­sons why we wear masks now is be­cause of the risk of asymp­to­matic or pre-symp­to­matic in­fec­tion that could be ac­tively trans­mit­ted. The dan­ger of that is suf­fi­ciently pro­nounced that an un­tar­geted pol­icy wherein ev­ery­one wears a mask is valu­able.</p>
    <p>“In nor­mal times, how­ever, we would not wear a mask to hedge against the risk of a rhi­novirus in­fec­tion, for in­stance, since the risk is low and his­tor­i­cally tol­er­ated,” he added.</p>
    <p>But a sil­ver lin­ing which could arise from this pan­demic is that peo­ple com­ing down with a cold or the flu in fu­ture may fol­low the same prac­tices as they did for Covid-19 – avoid­ing go­ing to work, cut­ting out so­cial con­tact and wear­ing a mask to re­duce the spread to oth­ers, he noted.</p>
    <p>And if a fu­ture dis­ease X were to be a re­s­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion, he said, peo­ple would have ben­e­fited from the “dry run” offered by Covid-19, through the knowl­edge of what works and what does not, hav­ing tech­nol­ogy and increased lab ca­pac­ity, and know­ing the im­por­tance of so­cial dis­tanc­ing and mask wear­ing.</p>
