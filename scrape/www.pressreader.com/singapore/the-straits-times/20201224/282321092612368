    <p>BREAK­ING BAR­RI­ERS</p>
    <p>A first is al­ways go­ing to be no­ticed. Sev­eral women in sports know this from ex­pe­ri­ence re­cently.</p>
    <p>Sarah Fuller is the first woman to play in a Power Five Amer­i­can football game. Kim Ng is the first fe­male gen­eral man­ager of a Ma­jor League Base­ball ( MLB) team. Alyssa Nakken is the first woman to be a full-time coach on an MLB ros­ter. Blake Bolden is the first black fe­male scout for a Na­tional Hockey League (NHL) team.</p>
    <p>All of those ac­com­plish­ments oc­curred this year and were cel­e­brated.</p>
    <p>But even some of the women who achieved them were con­flicted over the at­ten­tion they re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“I do think it’s ridicu­lous, but, I mean, we’re ap­pre­ci­at­ing the fact that al­lies are now open­ing these doors for peo­ple that have the power to present them­selves,” said Bolden, who was added to the Los An­ge­les Kings’ scout­ing depart­ment in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“There’s go­ing to be a point where be­ing a woman and a scout, or a coach or a gen­eral man­ager, won’t be like this, ‘Oh my gosh, can you be­lieve it’?”</p>
    <p>Fuller’s big­gest head­lines did not come when, as a goal­keeper, she led her Van­der­bilt women’s football team to an up­set of top-seeded Arkansas in the South-east­ern Con­fer­ence (SEC) tour­na­ment fi­nal on Nov 22.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they came six days later, af­ter she ap­peared in an Amer­i­can football game for Van­der­bilt and on Dec 12 be­came the first woman to score in a Power Five Amer­i­can football game by kick­ing two ex­tra points against Ten­nessee, adding to her pi­o­neer­ing re­sume.</p>
    <p>Fuller went from 1,000 In­sta­gram fol­low­ers to over 250,000 within days, be­com­ing a na­tional sen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s like noth­ing I ever ex­pe­ri­enced,” she said. “I was pretty sat­is­fied with a SEC cham­pi­onship, and I was help­ing out the football team.”</p>
    <p>For some women’s ath­letes, though, the fact that Fuller’s football achieve­ment was over­shad­owed by the Amer­i­can football one un­der­scored the idea that com­pet­ing among and against men may not be, for the women in­volved, an achieve­ment wor­thy of more at­ten­tion than do­ing so with women.</p>
    <p>“It’s like any­thing else as an ath­lete; you can’t let it bother you,” said April Goss, who was a kicker in Kent State’s football pro­gramme from 2012 to 2015. “But it’s chal­leng­ing; in a way, they don’t let you even feel how much you can do.”</p>
    <p>A range of women have got no­tice when in­vited to par­tic­i­pate against men; goal­tender Manon Rheaume may be known more for her two pre-sea­son games with the Tampa Bay Light­ning in the 1990s than she is for her own ca­reer in women’s ice hockey.</p>
    <p>Kendall Coyne Schofield, an Olympic gold medal­list, broke into the main­stream when she was a last-minute re­place­ment for an NHL player in the fastest skater com­pe­ti­tion dur­ing last year’s NHL All-Star week­end.</p>
    <p>They were touted as hav­ing bro­ken glass ceil­ings, yet the scru­tiny is some­times with­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­fore scor­ing in the game against Ten­nessee, Fuller ex­e­cuted a squib kick to be­gin the sec­ond half of a 41-0 loss to Mis­souri on Nov 28.</p>
    <p>A squib kick is nei­ther ma­jes­tic nor does it have a high arc; it is usu­ally a short drive that bounces around be­fore a mem­ber of the re­ceiv­ing team can field it.</p>
    <p>That kick elicited a flood of neg­a­tive re­sponses on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“If you had a male kicker from like, the men’s soc­cer team, brought in, and the coach asked him to kick it, there wouldn’t have been a con­tro­versy,” said Julie Harsh­barger, who has kicked for sev­eral pro­fes­sional in­door Amer­i­can football teams.</p>
    <p>Fuller said: “There’s al­ways the hate com­ments, or what­ever, but I was sur­prised at how much con­tro­versy it drew. I was sup­posed to kick it right there; I don’t know what the is­sue is. I think I did a great job.”</p>
    <p>There’s go­ing to be a point where be­ing a woman and a scout, or a coach or a gen­eral man­ager, won’t be like this, ‘Oh my gosh, can you be­lieve it’?</p>
