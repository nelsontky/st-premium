    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong is emerg­ing as a case study of how the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is af­fect­ing vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of so­ci­ety, as tens of thou­sands have been thrown out of work with lit­tle so­cial safety net to sup­port them in one of the world’s most un­equal and ex­pen­sive ci­ties.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is mired in its deep­est re­ces­sion on record af­ter a dis­as­trous year of so­cial un­rest and then the virus out­break, with a net 250,000 peo­ple los­ing work in the city since May, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg from the Cen­sus and Sta­tis­tics De­part­ment Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The l ower-paid ser­vices and hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tors have been hit the hard­est, as protests and vir­us­con­trol mea­sures shut­tered re­tail­ers and left ho­tels and restau­rants empty.</p>
    <p>As Hong Kong has no gen­eral un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fit pro­vi­sion, that leaves most low-in­come job seek­ers re­liant on sav­ings, fam­ily as­sis­tance and char­i­ties at a time of stretched bud­gets and re­newed con­cerns over a third wave of the virus out­break.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s in­come in­equal­ity has long been higher than that of any Group of Seven econ­omy and the 19 wealth­i­est bil­lion­aires in the city con­trol as­sets of about US$230 bil­lion (S$320 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires’ In­dex.</p>
    <p>“The wealth gap has ob­vi­ously widened be­cause of Covid-19,” said Ms Iris Pang, greater China chief econ­o­mist at ING Bank.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong could be­come in­creas­ingly more un­equal in terms of in­come. Poverty is be­com­ing an im­mi­nent is­sue. In short, the poor are get­ting poorer.”</p>
    <p>Last month’s em­ploy­ment sta­tis­tics are ex­pected to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Job va­can­cies in the re­tail as well as the ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices sec­tors, among the most im­por­tant sources of em­ploy­ment for the work­ing class, have been par­tic­u­larly hard hit by the virus. These job va­can­cies plum­meted 64 per cent and 80 per cent, re­spec­tively, from a year ago as of March.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of em­ployed peo­ple has dropped by al­most 250,000 for a record 6.5 per cent de­cline from a year ago as of May. The num­ber em­ployed in the city now stands at just more than 3.6 mil­lion, less than half of Hong Kong’s 7.5 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion, as the num­ber of un­em­ployed has al­most dou­bled since the end of last year to more than 230,000.</p>
    <p>As of 2018, about one mil­lion peo­ple in Hong Kong were con­sid­ered poor by the gov­ern­ment’s def­i­ni­tion, for a poverty rate of al­most 15 per cent, af­ter adding re­cur­ring ben­e­fits such as the Higher Old Age Liv­ing Al­lowance in June 2018, ac­cord­ing to a De­cem­ber gov­ern­ment re­port.</p>
    <p>It is likely that a year of po­lit­i­cal un­rest and re­ces­sion as well as the coro­n­avirus has seen those num­bers worsen.</p>
    <p>One of the most vul­ner­a­ble groups is the city’s grow­ing pop­u­la­tion of peo­ple 65 and older, who are of­ten un­pre­pared for re­tire­ment and at a dis­ad­van­tage when com­pet­ing for jobs, while now also fac­ing greater health risks from the virus.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has a weak so­cial safety net for its older pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2018, those 65 and older who were con­sid­ered poor stood at about 360,000 for a poverty rate of 31 per cent, more than dou­ble the over­all level, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“When I was 50 years old, peo­ple would still want me to work for them, but at the Chi­nese restau­rant that I worked for, even though I could han­dle the job, the boss still looked down on me,” said Ms Y.T. Chan, a 65-year-old woman who lost her full-time job as a dish­washer last Novem­ber fol­low­ing an ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Af­ter strug­gling to find work for months, she now earns about HK$2,000 (S$358) a month as a cleaner and dish­washer.</p>
    <p>Her in­come can barely cover her ex­penses, which in­cludes HK$4,200 in rent a month, so she re­lies on loans from friends or oc­ca­sional money sent from her sons in main­land China.</p>
    <p>Job­less­ness among work­ers aged 50 to 59 has climbed to 6.5 per cent, well above the over­all level of 5.9 per cent, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple aged be­tween 15 and 19 are still the worst off, with a 16.1 per cent un­em­ploy­ment rate.</p>
    <p>“I met a re­cently un­em­ployed man in his early 60s with just a com­bined HK$48 sav­ings in two of his bank ac­counts,” said Mr Ja­son Lam, a com­mu­nity or­gan­iser.</p>
    <p>“He was so over­whelmed when we of­fered him some food pack­ages – you could tell how hard his life was.”</p>
