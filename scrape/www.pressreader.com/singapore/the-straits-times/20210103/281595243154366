    <p>Pho­tos of high wa­ter lev­els at Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park have caused some ne­ti­zens to as­sume it is flooded, but the park is func­tion­ing ex­actly as in­tended – with a canal that chan­nels rain­wa­ter down­stream.</p>
    <p>The spike in wa­ter lev­els comes from tor­ren­tial rain over the past few days, but this is part of the nor­mal func­tion­ing of the park’s wa­ter­way. A stream run­ning through the park is part of the Kal­lang River, but it is also a nat­u­ralised canal de­signed to ac­com­mo­date fluc­tu­at­ing wa­ter lev­els, which may rise as high as 3m.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to in­for­ma­tion on the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) web­site, there are safety fea­tures vis­i­ble in the park to en­sure that mem­bers of the public are aware of im­pend­ing high wa­ter lev­els.</p>
    <p>“A river mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem with wa­ter level sen­sors is in place to pro­vide early warn­ing in the event of im­pend­ing heavy rain or ris­ing wa­ter lev­els. Warn­ing signs, red mark­ers, life buoys and CCTVs have also been put up along the river,” says the web­site.</p>
    <p>The re­de­vel­op­ment of the wa­ter­way from 2009 to 2012 was a joint col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween na­tional wa­ter agency PUB and NParks un­der the Ac­tive, Beau­ti­ful, Clean Wa­ters Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the PUB web­site, the river chan­nel was de­signed based on a flood­plain con­cept and is linked to a net­work of drains in the city. A flood­plain is an area of land ad­ja­cent to a stream or a river which fills with wa­ter dur­ing pe­ri­ods of high dis­charge.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing dry weather, the flow of wa­ter is con­fined to a nar­row stream in the mid­dle of the river.</p>
    <p>In the event of a storm, the ad­ja­cent park area dou­bles up as a con­veyance chan­nel, car­ry­ing the rain­wa­ter down­stream grad­u­ally.</p>
    <p>The nat­u­ral­i­sa­tion of the Kal­lang River serves both func­tional and aes­thetic pur­poses.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the ABC Wa­ters Pro­gramme, a com­bi­na­tion of plants, nat­u­ral ma­te­ri­als such as rocks, and civil engi­neer­ing tech­niques were in­tro­duced to soften the edges of the wa­ter­way, give it a nat­u­ral ap­pear­ance and pre­vent soil ero­sion,” says the PUB web­site.</p>
