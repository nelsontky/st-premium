    <p>NEW YORK As Ge­orge Clooney flew through the air after be­ing flung from his mo­tor­cy­cle, his life did not flash be­fore his eyes.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he thought of his twins, Alexan­der and Ella, who were one year old at the time of the ac­ci­dent in 2018.</p>
    <p>“Mostly it was just the thought that this was it and that I wasn’t gonna see them again,” the ac­tordi­rec­tor said in an in­ter­view pub­lished in GQ mag­a­zine’s De­cem­ber/Jan­uary is­sue, in which he was named Icon of the Year.</p>
    <p>Open­ing up for the first time about de­tails of the near-fa­tal crash, which took place in Sar­dinia, Italy, he re­counted that he was rid­ing at 120kmh on his mo­tor­cy­cle to the set of the Catch-22 tele­vi­sion se­ries, when a car turned di­rectly in front of him.</p>
    <p>“I launched. I went head over heels. But I landed on my hands and knees. If you did it 100 times, maybe once, you l and on your hands and knees. Any other ver­sion you land, you’re toast. It knocked me out of my shoes,” he said.</p>
    <p>He crushed the car’s wind­shield with his hel­met and his mouth was full of glass when he hit the ground.</p>
    <p>From his years of ex­pe­ri­ence in rid­ing mo­tor­cy­cles, the 59-yearold ex­pected to be paral­ysed from such an im­pact and so he lay on the road, “wait­ing for the switch to turn off”.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, de­spite the spec­tac­u­lar crash, he did not sus­tain se­ri­ous in­juries and the only con­se­quence he suf­fered was that his wife Amal Clooney has since banned him from rid­ing mo­tor­cy­cles.</p>
    <p>Mar­ried since 2014, he re­vealed in the in­ter­view that be­fore meet­ing his wife, he thought he would re­main a bach­e­lor, al­beit one of the most el­i­gi­ble ones in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>He added: “My life is full. I’m do­ing well. And I didn’t know how un-full it was un­til I met Amal. And then, ev­ery­thing changed.</p>
    <p>“And I was like, ‘Oh, ac­tu­ally, this has been a huge empty space.’”</p>
    <p>For the past year, he has been hap­pily work­ing from home with his wife and kids, iso­lat­ing them­selves as a pre­cau­tion due to his age and also be­cause his son is asth­matic.</p>
    <p>“I cut my own hair and I cut my kids’ hair and I’m mop­ping and vacuuming and do­ing the laun­dry and do­ing the dishes every day,” he said.</p>
