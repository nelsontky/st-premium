    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s pro­posal to in­voke emer­gency rule in Malaysia to rein in a spike i n coro­n­avirus cases has been met with frosty re­sponses from po­lit­i­cal ri­vals and al­lies, as well as civil so­ci­ety lead­ers, who branded the move as dis­pro­por­tion­ate and un­jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, is set to meet his fel­low rulers among the nine royal house­holds to­day at 2.30pm to de­cide on Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s pro­posal.</p>
    <p>The power play is hap­pen­ing even as Malaysia has been ex­pe­ri­enc­ing an ex­po­nen­tial surge in virus cases since late last month, fol­low­ing the Sabah state elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Around one-third of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion is un­der par­tial lock­down.</p>
    <p>For­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad said there is no break­down of law and or­der in Malaysia to jus­tify an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries with more se­vere Covid-19 prob­lems have not de­clared emer­gency for the whole coun­try but only for af­fected ar­eas,” said Tun Dr Ma­hathir.</p>
    <p>He claimed the gov­ern­ment’s move was an at­tempt to deal with the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment re­mains in doubt, and it re­mains to be seen if his gov­ern­ment’s bud­get can win a par­lia­men­tary vote when it is tabled next month.</p>
    <p>FOR­MER CAB­I­NET MIN­IS­TER RAFI­DAH AZIZ</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter was also the sub­ject of a push from sev­eral law­mak­ers to have a no-con­fi­dence mo­tion tabled in Par­lia­ment, in­clud­ing one from his own Perikatan Na­sional coali­tion.</p>
    <p>For­mer Cab­i­net min­is­ter Rafi­dah Aziz said declar­ing an emer­gency now would be tan­ta­mount to “killing a few rats us­ing a bomb”.</p>
    <p>She said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day: “Al­ready the eco­nomic and so­cio-eco­nomic im­pact on the peo­ple and na­tion is con­tin­u­ing to drain us all of our re­silience and con­fi­dence. But to de­clare an emer­gency, im­pact­ing Par­lia­ment, the demo­cratic pro­cesses and dis­pens­ing with demo­cratic norms – that is too much.”</p>
    <p>Deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad</p>
    <p>Hasan of Umno, a party in the rul­ing coali­tion, said the gov­ern­ment should use demo­cratic and sci­en­tific means to bat­tle the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>“Han­dle this cri­sis by up­hold­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion, by al­low­ing democ­racy to func­tion, stream­line the re­sponse of the pub­lic health and safety system, and pri­ori­tise the in­ter­ests of or­di­nary peo­ple by not adding to their mis­ery,” he said in a Face­book post­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Civil so­ci­ety groups were sim­i­larly crit­i­cal of the move.</p>
    <p>Elec­toral watchdog Ber­sih 2.0 crit­i­cised the move as “overkill” in a state­ment on Fri­day, but at the same time urged the op­po­si­tion to back any bud­get Bill in Par­lia­ment to en­sure Mr Muhyid­din’s bud­get</p>
    <p>does not fail.</p>
    <p>A group of lawyers con­sist­ing of for­mer Malaysian Bar pres­i­dents urged a re­think­ing of the move, say­ing that it would be a “night­mar­ish” er­ror that plunges Malaysia into one of its “dark­est” days.</p>
    <p>“If the pre­dom­i­nant ob­jec­tive of the sug­gested dec­la­ra­tion is to sus­pend Par­lia­ment, and to gain emer­gency pow­ers, then it will ob­vi­ously be an un­law­ful de­sign which, if unchecked, will dis­en­fran­chise and de­ceive Malaysians,” said the state­ment signed by seven for­mer Bar pres­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Malaysia last de­clared a na­tional emer­gency 51 years ago in May 1969 fol­low­ing deadly race ri­ots.</p>
    <p>PO­TEN­TIALLY UN­LAW­FUL</p>
    <p>If the pre­dom­i­nant ob­jec­tive of the sug­gested dec­la­ra­tion is to sus­pend Par­lia­ment, and to gain emer­gency pow­ers, then it will ob­vi­ously be an un­law­ful de­sign which, if unchecked, will dis­en­fran­chise and de­ceive Malaysians.</p>
