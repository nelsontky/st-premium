    <p>• The “Orig­i­nal Nine” group, whose ef­forts ul­ti­mately led to the cre­ation of the Women’s Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion (WTA), head­lined the list of nom­i­nees up for in­duc­tion into the In­ter­na­tional Ten­nis Hall of Fame.</p>
    <p>The “Orig­i­nal Nine”, who took a stand against a dis­par­ity in prize money and play­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for women in pro­fes­sional ten­nis, were nom­i­nated in the con­trib­u­tor cat­e­gory, the Hall of Fame said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>For­mer play­ers Lley­ton He­witt, Juan Car­los Fer­rero, Lisa Ray­mond, Jonas Bjork­man and Sergi Bruguera were nom­i­nated in the player cat­e­gory, while late coach Den­nis Van der Meer was listed in the con­trib­u­tor cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The “Orig­i­nal Nine” are Amer­i­cans Peaches Bartkow­icz, Rosie Casals, Julie Held­man, Billie Jean</p>
    <p>King, Kristy Pi­geon, Nancy Richey, Va­lerie Ziegen­fuss, and Aus­tralians Judy Te­gart Dal­ton and Kerry Melville Reid.</p>
    <p>This week marks the 50th an­niver­sary of when the “Orig­i­nal Nine” group broke the ten­nis es­tab­lish­ment by sign­ing US$1 (S$1.36) con­tracts with pro­moter Gla­dys Held­man to com­pete in a ground­break­ing women-only tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The event proved a suc­cess and the tenac­ity of the group, which took ac­tive roles in pro­mot­ing the cir­cuit, led to the cre­ation of the or­gan­is­ing body for women’s ten­nis.</p>
    <p>“In a time where de­fy­ing the odds and hav­ing a voice is more im­por­tant than ever, it’s ex­tremely re­ward­ing to see the im­pact the ‘Orig­i­nal Nine’ made 50 years ago can still be felt around the world to­day,” King said in the Hall of Fame’s news re­lease.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian He­witt, the youngest player (20) ever to claim the world No. 1 rank­ing, won the US Open and Wim­ble­don ti­tles dur­ing his 16-year sin­gles ca­reer.</p>
    <p>For­mer world No. 1 Fer­rero won his only Grand Slam at the 2003 French Open and in 2000 was a mem­ber of Spain’s first Davis Cup cham­pi­onship-win­ning team.</p>
    <p>Span­ish clay-court great Bruguera won back-to-back ti­tles at Roland Gar­ros in 1993 and 1994, the first against two-time de­fend­ing cham­pion Jim Courier af­ter he came back from be­ing down 2-0 in the fifth set.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can player Ray­mond won 11 Grand Slam ti­tles in dou­bles and mixed dou­bles while Swede Bjork­man won nine Ma­jor dou­bles ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Van der Meer de­vel­oped a universal man­ner of teach­ing ten­nis to grow the sport and is the founder of the Pro­fes­sional Ten­nis Reg­istry, which of­fers ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>The Class of 2021 will be an­nounced in early next year with an in­duc­tion cer­e­mony slated to take place on July 17.</p>
