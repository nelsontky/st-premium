    <p>Help­ing smaller firms emerge stronger from the coro­n­avirus cri­sis is tak­ing cen­tre stage for the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) in the run-up to Bud­get 2021 due in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Its wish list com­prises six rec­om­men­da­tions that it be­lieves will al­low com­pa­nies to gain ac­cess to nec­es­sary re­sources, build re­silience to over­come fu­ture crises and cre­ate more value for their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Three key pro­pos­als call for the Gov­ern­ment to ex­tend the tem­po­rary bridg­ing loan pro­gramme un­til March 2022, speed up pub­lic-sec­tor pay­ments to sup­pli­ers and ex­tend for­eign worker levy re­bates to more sec­tors. There are also re­sources di­rected at help­ing small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) im­prove their cy­ber-se­cu­rity pre­pared­ness, train­ing and up­skilling lo­cal work­ers for tech roles and sup­port­ing in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>SBF chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said that while busi­nesses are grate­ful for gov­ern­ment sup­port amid Covid-19, eco­nomic re­cov­ery re­mains un­cer­tain and un­even.</p>
    <p>“It is cru­cial that ad­e­quate sup­port mea­sures con­tinue to be in place to help busi­nesses ad­dress cur­rent is­sues and, at the same time, po­si­tion them for fu­ture growth,” he added.</p>
    <p>SBF’s SME Com­mit­tee, which de­vised the six pro­pos­als, said the tem­po­rary bridg­ing loan pro­gramme – which pro­vides ac­cess to work­ing cap­i­tal – is a vi­tal scheme for com­pa­nies that are well po­si­tioned to take on ad­di­tional risks to emerge stronger from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It rec­om­mends that the Gov­ern­ment ex­tend the scheme un­til March 2022 as re­cov­ery is ex­pected to re­main un­cer­tain and un­even across sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, timely pay­ments can help sus­tain a busi­ness and are es­pe­cially crit­i­cal dur­ing a down­turn, where man­ag­ing costs and fall­ing de­mand may pose chal­lenges, it added.</p>
    <p>SBF’s SME Com­mit­tee rec­om­mends that terms of pay­ment be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and its sup­pli­ers be re­duced from 30 to 14 days. Pay­ments for con­tracts be­low $100,000 could be made within five work­ing days, pro­vided that the ser­vices or prod­ucts are sat­is­fac­tory.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal on for­eign worker levy re­bates stems from a de­ci­sion by the Min­istry of Man­power in Au­gust to set aside $320 mil­lion worth of re­bates un­til De­cem­ber next year for firms in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors.</p>
    <p>SBF’s SME Com­mit­tee be­lieves the rebate can be ex­tended to other sec­tors, in­clud­ing food and bev­er­age, hospi­tal­ity and lo­gis­tics ser­vices, un­til Dec 31 next year to al­le­vi­ate some of the man­power and cash flow chal­lenges fac­ing firms.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal on cy­ber se­cu­rity is aimed at speed­ing up the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of lo­cal com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>It calls on the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore to work with rel­e­vant in­dus­try part­ners to ap­point ad­vis­ers to help SMEs pre­vent ma­li­cious cy­ber ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Re­cruit­ing and devel­op­ing the next gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s tech tal­ent is an­other area of fo­cus.</p>
    <p>It builds on the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board’s Tech.Pass scheme an­nounced last month that aims to at­tract up to 500 founders, lead­ers and ex­perts from es­tab­lished or fast-grow­ing tech com­pa­nies to Sin­ga­pore. SBF’s SME Com­mit­tee be­lieves Tech.Pass can be en­hanced to in­clude train­ing lo­cal work­ers, in­clud­ing ac­cel­er­at­ing ca­reer con­ver­sions of peo­ple from non-tech roles to tech roles.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, PwC Sin­ga­pore also re­leased its Bud­get 2021 pro­pos­als yes­ter­day in which it sug­gested var­i­ous tax mea­sures, in­clud­ing ex­tend­ing re­lief to em­ploy­ees who have to set up a home of­fice.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses could also be al­lowed to claim in­put tax in full on ex­penses re­lated to re­mote work­ing, such as em­ploy­ees’ util­i­ties and mo­bile phone fees, it added.</p>
    <p>Other pro­pos­als in­clude sup­port for grow­ing sec­tors such as the agri­cul­ture and food in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>PwC Sin­ga­pore’s tax leader Chris Woo said: “With the un­cer­tainty sur­round­ing the pan­demic and the in­sta­bil­ity of the global geopo­lit­i­cal cli­mate, this Bud­get will need bal­ance pro­vid­ing sup­port for trans­for­ma­tion that is sus­tain­able while in­creas­ing needed gov­ern­ment tax rev­enue based on a broader pur­pose to grow Sin­ga­pore’s economy.”</p>
    <p>It is cru­cial that ad­e­quate sup­port mea­sures con­tinue to be in place to help busi­nesses ad­dress cur­rent is­sues and, at the same time, po­si­tion them for fu­ture growth.</p>
    <p>MR HO MENG KIT, Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive, who said eco­nomic re­cov­ery re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
