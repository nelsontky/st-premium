    <p>South Korea re­ported more than 500 new coro­n­avirus cases for the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive day yes­ter­day, a level un­seen in nearly nine months, as a third wave of in­fec­tions spread na­tion­wide, leav­ing the au­thor­i­ties scram­bling to pro­vide more hospi­tal beds.</p>
    <p>SEOUL • Asymp­to­matic Covid-19 pa­tients are be­hind a surge in new cases in South Korea, frus­trat­ing ef­forts to con­trol trans­mis­sion by the East Asian coun­try, which man­aged to keep in­fec­tions un­der con­trol in pre­vi­ous out­breaks.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 569 new cases in the 24 hours end­ing mid­night on Thurs­day, a level un­seen in nearly nine months as it grap­ples with the third wave of the pan­demic, which ap­pears to be wors­en­ing de­spite tough new so­cial distancing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>With young peo­ple at the cen­tre of the surge, the health au­thor­i­ties es­ti­mate asymp­to­matic pa­tients now ac­count for 40 per cent of to­tal in­fec­tions, up sharply from 20 per cent to 30 per cent in June.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is ex­tremely se­ri­ous and acute, as all of the 17 metropoli­tan cities and prov­inces and es­pe­cially all the 25 dis­tricts in Seoul are re­port­ing new cases,” Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun told a meet­ing on Covid-19 re­sponses.</p>
    <p>The daily tally of 569 came a day after the num­bers hit the high­est level since March 6, when South Korea was reel­ing from the first ma­jor Covid-19 out­break out­side China.</p>
    <p>Of the lat­est cases, 525 were do­mes­ti­cally trans­mit­ted and more than 64 per cent of those were from the Seoul metropoli­tan area, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity were in Greater Seoul – 204 in Seoul, 112 in Gyeonggi prov­ince, which sur­rounds the cap­i­tal, and 21 in In­cheon.</p>
    <p>Out­side the Seoul metropoli­tan area, cases were reg­is­tered in all 17 cities and prov­inces, with 38 cases in South Gyeongsang prov­ince, 31 cases in South Chungcheon­g prov­ince and 24 cases in Bu­san and North Je­olla prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Clus­ter in­fec­tions were trace­able to small so­cial gath­er­ings, work­places, pub­lic bath­houses, pri­vate ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tutes and re­li­gious fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties cau­tiously ex­pect the up­ward trend in new daily cases to con­tinue un­til early next month, with the peak to be reached at the end of next week.</p>
    <p>It could be re­versed next week as tougher so­cial distancing mea­sures in the Greater Seoul area be­gin to show the im­pact, they say.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said the fresh wave is more dif­fi­cult to trace and con­tain than early out­breaks, which were con­cen­trated in a spe­cific re­gion or among a cer­tain re­li­gious group.</p>
    <p>Alarmed by the coun­try­wide spread and in­creas­ing num­ber of cases in­volv­ing younger pa­tients, Mr Chung warned that daily in­fec­tions could swell to 1,000 and there could be hospi­tal bed short­ages un­less the con­ta­gion was brought un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said there are suf­fi­cient beds avail­able for now but it could face short­falls if the cur­rent spike con­tin­ues for more than two weeks.</p>
    <p>South Korea has re­ported to­tal in­fec­tions of 32,887, with 516 deaths.</p>
