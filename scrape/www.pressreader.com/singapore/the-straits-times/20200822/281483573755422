    <p>Stu­dents who test pos­i­tive for Covid-19, or who are on a quar­an­tine or­der or stay-home no­tice, will not be al­lowed to sit the national writ­ten ex­am­i­na­tions at the end of this year.</p>
    <p>But stu­dents who are on med­i­cal leave due to acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion may do so, if they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These were some of the new ar­range­ments spelt out by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board yes­ter­day to en­sure the safety of stu­dents sit­ting the year-end national ex­ams as well as that of in­vig­i­la­tors amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The four national ex­am­i­na­tions – the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion, the N lev­els, O lev­els and A lev­els – will be­gin from Sept 14 and end on Dec 2.</p>
    <p>About 120,000 stu­dents will be sit­ting the ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The four national ex­am­i­na­tions – the PSLE, N lev­els, O lev­els and A lev­els – will go on as sched­uled from Sept 14 to Dec 2, but there will be special ar­range­ments made to en­sure that stu­dents and in­vig­i­la­tors re­main safe from the Covid-19 virus.</p>
    <p>For one thing, stu­dents who have the virus and those on quar­an­tine or­ders (QO) or stay-home no­tices (SHN) will not be al­lowed to sit the ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>This is to en­sure they do not pose a risk to oth­ers, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board (SEAB) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ex­cep­tions, though, will be made on a case-by-case ba­sis for stu­dents who were put on stay-home no­tices for mak­ing a trip for com­pas­sion­ate rea­sons, such as trav­el­ling out of Sin­ga­pore to at­tend a fu­neral.</p>
    <p>But these stu­dents will take their ex­am­i­na­tions in a cen­tralised venue man­aged by the ex­ams board and seated in­di­vid­u­ally in a room.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that these stu­dents do not min­gle with the other can­di­dates, they will have des­ig­nated toi­lets. There will also be sep­a­rate en­try and exit routes for each ex­am­i­na­tion room.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther min­imise the risk of trans­mis­sion, these stu­dents must take their own pri­vate ve­hi­cles or pre-booked taxis to the ex­am­i­na­tion venue as they are not al­lowed to take pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who are on leave of ab­sence (LOA) due to close con­tact with con­firmed cases will also not be al­lowed to take the ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, those who are on LOA, as a re­sult of stay­ing in the same house­hold with in­di­vid­u­als on home quar­an­tine or­ders (HQO), will be al­lowed to sit the ex­am­i­na­tions only if they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19. Ar­range­ments will be made for these can­di­dates to be tested, and the costs of the test will be borne by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, those who are on med­i­cal leave due to acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion (ARI) will be al­lowed to sit the ex­am­i­na­tions if they test neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The MOE and SEAB said that can­di­dates who miss the national ex­am­i­na­tions with valid rea­sons can ap­ply for special con­sid­er­a­tion in the grad­ing.</p>
    <p>In award­ing a grade, SEAB will re­fer to the stu­dent’s per­for­mance in the sub­ject in the other national and school-based ex­am­i­na­tions, as well as the stu­dent’s per­for­mance rel­a­tive to his school­mates in the same year in the national and school-based ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials said all special con­sid­er­a­tion ap­pli­ca­tions will be as­sessed on a case-by-case ba­sis and sub­jected to a rig­or­ous re­view process.</p>
    <p>The MOE and SEAB said that as the national year-end writ­ten ex­am­i­na­tions are im­por­tant mile­stones that af­fect stu­dents’ pro­gres­sion, it wants to make sure that as many stu­dents as pos­si­ble are given the op­por­tu­nity to take the ex­am­i­na­tions, while mak­ing it safe for their school­mates and in­vig­i­la­tors.</p>
    <p>In all, around 120,000 stu­dents will take the four national ex­am­i­na­tions this year.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Wong Siew Hoong, MOE’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral of ed­u­ca­tion: “The national ex­am­i­na­tions are an in­te­gral part of teach­ing and learn­ing, and the re­sults of these ex­am­i­na­tions are im­por­tant for the pro­gres­sion of the stu­dents to their next phase of their ed­u­ca­tional jour­ney. So, it is im­por­tant that we are able to con­duct the ex­ams, and to con­duct them safely.</p>
    <p>“In the event that they can­not sit ex­ams with valid rea­sons re­lated to Covid-19 or not re­lated to Covid-19, again, I want to as­sure stu­dents that there are pro­cesses in place to be able to help them with the pro­jected grade.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yue Lip Sin, chief ex­ec­u­tive of SEAB, also as­sured stu­dents and their par­ents that for those who miss the ex­ams, the board will use “mul­ti­ple sources of in­for­ma­tion to make sure that can­di­dates are given a fair grade”.</p>
    <p>Safe man­age­ment mea­sures will con­tinue to be i mple­mented i n schools and ex­am­i­na­tion venues dur­ing the national ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>These in­clude testing all PSLE can­di­dates, who show the first signs of ARI, for Covid-19 be­fore and dur­ing the ex­am­i­na­tion pe­riod. This pro­vi­sion will kick in from Sept 17, some 14 days be­fore the start of the PSLE writ­ten ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>MOE has also en­cour­aged schools to im­ple­ment a study break prior to the national ex­am­i­na­tions to min­imise the risk of a large number of stu­dents be­ing quar­an­tined or put on LOA due to Covid-19 cases which may oc­cur in schools.</p>
    <p>MOE and SEAB said they con­tinue to mon­i­tor the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion closely and pro­vide up­dates if there are any changes to the ex­am­i­na­tion ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“We urge all can­di­dates and staff to con­tinue prac­tis­ing good per­sonal hy­giene and ex­er­cise so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity,” they said.</p>
    <p>AS­SUR­ANCE</p>
    <p>In the event that they can­not sit ex­ams with valid rea­sons re­lated to Covid-19 or not re­lated to Covid-19, again, I want to as­sure stu­dents that there are pro­cesses in place to be able to help them with the ’’ pro­jected grade.</p>
