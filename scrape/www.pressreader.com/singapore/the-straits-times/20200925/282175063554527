    <p>An In­dian na­tional was consumed with anx­i­ety af­ter he was in­formed that he had a Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet a doc­tor from Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH), where Mr Alagu Periyakar­ru­pan had been warded, told the court yes­ter­day that the 46-year-old con­struc­tion worker was on track to be moved to a com­mu­nity fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>On April 23, Mr Alagu was found ly­ing mo­tion­less, without a pulse, at an out­door stair­case land­ing on the third floor of KTPH, just days af­ter he had been ad­mit­ted for the Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an in­quiry into his death, the court heard that Mr Alagu, who was ad­mit­ted to the hos­pi­tal on April 19, was de­scribed by other pa­tients as quiet, but he helped the nurses dis­trib­ute food trays dur­ing meal­times.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh Kah Hong, head of the psy­chi­a­try de­part­ment at KTPH and chair­man of the hos­pi­tal’s com­mit­tee tasked to re­view Mr Alagu’s death, said: “He men­tioned some wor­ries about his fi­nan­cial fu­ture as well as wor­ry­ing about his kids in In­dia... Those were com­mon con­cerns by pa­tients in sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Dr Goh said that many mi­grant work­ers who are Covid-19 pa­tients have a “con­cep­tual dif­fi­culty” in un­der­stand­ing why they are in hos­pi­tal, even af­ter their di­ag­no­sis had been trans­lated to them in their na­tive lan­guages.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Mr Alagu had no com­pli­ca­tions and was on track to be trans­ferred to a com­mu­nity fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>But at about 5.30am on April 23, he made two video record­ings on his phone from the toi­let of his ward, say­ing that he wanted to end his life be­cause he had the coronaviru­s in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>He is be­lieved to have then used a me­tal hook in his pos­ses­sion to prise open one of the win­dow panes by his bed, and leapt from the win­dow.</p>
    <p>An au­topsy re­port found that he died from in­juries caused by “a fall from height”. He had mul­ti­ple in­juries, in­clud­ing a rup­tured heart, bleed­ing into the chest cav­ity, frac­tured ribs and pelvis, and bleed­ing over the sur­face of his brain.</p>
    <p>There was no ev­i­dence to in­di­cate that his death was caused by pneu­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer, In­spec­tor Jo­lene Ng, tes­ti­fied that it could not be as­cer­tained where Mr Alagu ob­tained the me­tal hook, as in­ves­ti­ga­tions did not re­veal if it came from any­where in the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Since the in­ci­dent, KTPH has used sil­i­cone as an ad­he­sive on all its win­dows to en­sure that it would be more dif­fi­cult to prise open the catches se­cur­ing the win­dow panes.</p>
    <p>In April, the Min­istry of Man­power said Mr Alagu had been work­ing in Sin­ga­pore as a con­struc­tion worker for the same em­ployer since Septem­ber 2009. He did not file any com­plaints against his em­ployer.</p>
    <p>Mr Alagu’s nephew, Mr Veer­ap­pan Meenakshi Sun­daram, at­tended the in­quiry yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>State Coro­ner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam said she will de­liver her find­ings today.</p>
