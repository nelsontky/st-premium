    <p>HONG KONG Alibaba Group Hold­ing led a sell-off in Chi­nese tech giants trig­gered by fears that an­titrust scru­tiny will spread beyond Mr Jack Ma’s In­ter­net em­pire and en­snare more of the coun­try’s most pow­er­ful cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>China’s e-com­merce leader yes­ter­day raised a pro­posed stock buy­back pro­gramme by US$4 bil­lion (S$5.3 bil­lion) to US$10 bil­lion, ef­fec­tive for two years through the end of 2022. The pro­gramme, which be­gan this quar­ter, failed to stem a slump in the shares, which slid more than 5 per cent in Hong Kong to a six-month low.</p>
    <p>Once hailed as the stan­dard-bear­ers of China’s eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal as­cen­dancy, Alibaba and ri­vals like Ten­cent Hold­ings now face in­creas­ing pres­sure from reg­u­la­tors wor­ried about the speed with which they are amass­ing users and gain­ing in­flu­ence over al­most ev­ery as­pect of daily life.</p>
    <p>Alibaba has shed over US$230 bil­lion from its peak, bat­tered by the deep­en­ing scru­tiny and al­le­ga­tions of mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices at the crown jewel of Mr Ma’s em­pire.</p>
    <p>Shares in Ten­cent and Alibaba ri­val JD.com slid roughly 2 per cent in Hong Kong, while food de­liv­ery gi­ant Meituan tum­bled more than 4 per cent as in­vestors feared the an­titrust net might widen fur­ther. Af­fil­i­ate Alibaba Health In­for­ma­tion Tech­nol­ogy posted its big­gest two-day slump since July 2015.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Daily – the Com­mu­nist Party mouth­piece – ran a com­men­tary over the week­end warning Alibaba’s peers to take the an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Alibaba as a chance to lift their own aware­ness of fair com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is putting more pres­sure or wants to have more con­trol on the tech firms,” said Mr Jack­son Wong, as­set man­age­ment direc­tor at Am­ber Hill Cap­i­tal. “There is still very big sell­ing pres­sure on firms like Alibaba, Ten­cent or Meituan. These com­pa­nies have been grow­ing at a pace deemed by Bei­jing as too fast and have scales that are too big.”</p>
    <p>The State Ad­min­is­tra­tion for Market Reg­u­la­tion kicked off an an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Alibaba last week and dis­patched of­fi­cials to its Hangzhou head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors or­dered Mr Ma’s other on­line ti­tan – Ant Group – to return to its roots as a provider of pay­ment ser­vices, threat­en­ing to throt­tle growth in its most lu­cra­tive busi­nesses of con­sumer loans and wealth man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma, the flam­boy­ant co­founder of Alibaba and Ant, has all but van­ished from pub­lic view since Ant’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing got de­railed last month. As of early this month, the man most closely iden­ti­fied with the me­te­oric rise of China Inc was ad­vised by the gov­ern­ment to stay in the coun­try, a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter has said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma is not on the verge of a per­sonal down­fall, those fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion have said. His pub­lic re­buke is in­stead a warning that Bei­jing has lost pa­tience with the out­size power of its tech moguls, in­creas­ingly per­ceived as a threat to the political and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping prizes most.</p>
    <p>In­vestors re­main di­vided over the ex­tent to which Bei­jing will go after Alibaba and its com­pa­tri­ots as Bei­jing pre­pares to roll out the new anti-mo­nop­oly reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts pre­dict there is a crack­down com­ing, but a tar­geted one. They point to lan­guage in the reg­u­la­tions that sug­gests a heavy fo­cus on on­line com­merce, from forced ex­clu­sive ar­range­ments with mer­chants to al­go­rithm­based prices favour­ing new users. The reg­u­la­tions specif­i­cally warn against sell­ing at be­low-cost to weed out ri­vals.</p>
