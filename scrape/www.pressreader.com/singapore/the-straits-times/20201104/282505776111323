    <p>LAU­SANNE • Rus­sia’s at­tempt to over­turn its four-year ban from in­ter­na­tional sport got un­der way in Lau­sanne on Mon­day, the lat­est chap­ter of a long-run­ning and con­tro­ver­sial saga over state-sanc­tioned dop­ing.</p>
    <p>Last De­cem­ber, global anti-dop­ing body Wada de­clared the Rus­sian Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Rusada) to be non-com­pli­ant after be­ing ac­cused of ma­nip­u­lat­ing test­ing data.</p>
    <p>The ban meant the coun­try would miss the re-ar­ranged Tokyo Olympics next year as well as the 2022 Win­ter Olympics in China and football’s 2022 World Cup, although its players can play at the Qatar tour­na­ment if they wear neu­tral uni­forms, should they qual­ify.</p>
    <p>A hear­ing at the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS), which opened on Mon­day and is ex­pected to last un­til Fri­day, has al­ready caused divi­sion.</p>
    <p>Wada had re­quested that the pro­ceed­ings be held in public, but fol­low­ing dis­agree­ment be­tween all par­ties, the three CAS judges even­tu­ally opened the first ses­sion be­hind closed doors via tele­con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>A de­ci­sion will only be made public on an undis­closed date.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia con­sid­ers its ban to be legally in­de­fen­si­ble. For­mer Rus­sian prime min­is­ter Dmitry Medvedev de­scribed the sus­pen­sion as “chronic anti-Rus­sian hys­te­ria”.</p>
    <p>The hear­ing is be­ing billed as a land­mark week for Rus­sian sport and global anti-dop­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Wada also has plenty on the line after the United States threat­ened to pull its an­nual US$2.7 mil­lion (S$3.7 mil­lion) fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>US law­mak­ers ac­cused it of fail­ing to im­ple­ment gov­er­nance re­forms and have crit­i­cised the han­dling of the Rus­sian scan­dal.</p>
    <p>Also, the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) and sports fed­er­a­tions are ex­pect­ing clear di­rec­tives from the CAS, eight months be­fore the Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>“Wada has left no stone un­turned in prepa­ra­tion for this hear­ing and we are look­ing for­ward to hav­ing the op­por­tu­nity to present our case clearly and fairly to the panel,” said Wada pres­i­dent Wi­told Banka.</p>
    <p>“I re­main con­vinced that the Wada ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee made the right rec­om­men­da­tion in this case last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>“As at ev­ery other stage, we are fol­low­ing due process in re­la­tion to Rusada’s com­pli­ance procedure as we con­tinue to deal ef­fec­tively with this com­plex mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian saga is now un­com­fort­ably into its fifth year. In May 2016, Grig­ory Rod­chenkov, the for­mer head of Moscow’s anti- dop­ing lab­o­ra­tory, blew the whis­tle over state-backed dop­ing at the 2014 Sochi Win­ter Olympics.</p>
    <p>Two months later, barely two weeks be­fore the 2016 Olympics started, Wada called for Rus­sia to be banned from Rio. The IOC, how­ever, stopped short of an out­right ban and said in­di­vid­ual fed­er­a­tions would de­cide whether to al­low Rus­sian ath­letes to com­pete.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the IOC banned the Rus­sian Olympic Com­mit­tee from the 2018 Pyeongchan­g Win­ter Games, but al­lowed clean Rus­sian ath­letes to take part as neu­tral com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 168 Rus­sians even­tu­ally com­peted. Then, in Septem­ber 2018, Wada con­tro­ver­sially lifted its ban on Rusada, de­spite not hav­ing been granted ac­cess to its dop­ing-tainted Moscow lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia fi­nally handed over lab data to Wada in Jan­uary last year. How­ever, in yet another twist, in Septem­ber Wada gave Rus­sia three weeks to ex­plain “in­con­sis­ten­cies” in the data.</p>
    <p>World Ath­let­ics an­nounced it had suspended the process of re­in­stat­ing Rus­sia’s ath­let­ics fed­er­a­tion and was con­tem­plat­ing ex­pelling the coun­try en­tirely from the sport due to the dop­ing scan­dal. Wada then de­cided to ban Rus­sia for four years over the ma­nip­u­lated data.</p>
