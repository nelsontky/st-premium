    <p>• Thanks to me­te­oric gains i n glove-maker stocks, Malaysia’s eq­uity mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion is close to sur­pass­ing that of its richer neigh­bour Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s mar­ket value has surged 41 per cent since a March low to hit US$379 bil­lion (S$525 bil­lion) as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic su­per­charged de­mand for med­i­cal gloves and shares of the man­u­fac­tur­ers. That puts Malaysia about US$4 bil­lion away from sur­pass­ing Sin­ga­pore’s mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion for the first time in more than 16 years, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg that in­cludes only ac­tively traded pri­mary list­ings.</p>
    <p>“This is a re­flec­tion of the rel­a­tive for­tunes of the two economies and this di­ver­gence may con­tinue for a while,” said Mr Nir­gu­nan Tiruchel­vam, head of con­sumer eq­uity re­search at Tel­limer.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia has in­te­grated man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­tries like glove mak­ers”, while Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is based on fi­nance and prop­erty, he added.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has sparked a reshuf­fle in Asia’s largest stocks, with the likes of tech­nol­ogy and health­care firms grow­ing big­ger than ever.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s mar­ket lost US$113 bil­lion this year as it grap­ples with a slump in global trade, Malaysia’s cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion bounced back due to huge gains in glove shares.</p>
    <p>In fact, Top Glove Corp on Thurs­day un­seated Pub­lic Bank to be­come the sec­ond most valu­able stock on Malaysia’s eq­uity bench­mark, af­ter the for­mer’s stock surged more than 440 per cent.</p>
    <p>An­other glove pro­ducer, Su­per­max Corp, has leapt more than 1,100 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>The scorch­ing rally in the sec­tor has re­versed the for­tunes of what was last year’s worst-per­form­ing stock mar­ket in Asia. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI in­dex is the only bench­mark stock gauge in South-east Asia to have briefly erased losses made this year. The mea­sure is lit­tle changed year to date.</p>
    <p>The glove-maker rally has also fu­elled fevered trad­ing in the coun­try’s eq­uity mar­ket, with the num­ber of shares chang­ing hands reach­ing a record high this week. Do­mes­tic buy­ers have dom­i­nated the mar­ket dur­ing the course of the year, with net out­flows by for­eign in­vestors to­talling US$4.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia, whose gross do­mes­tic prod­uct was US$365 bil­lion by the end of last year, has been sup­ported by the boom­ing global de­mand for gloves and its big­ger pool of do­mes­tic con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore’s US$372 bil­lion econ­omy is heav­ily linked to trade and tourism, and it holds the grim dis­tinc­tion of hav­ing one of the high­est num­ber of virus cases in South-east Asia.</p>
