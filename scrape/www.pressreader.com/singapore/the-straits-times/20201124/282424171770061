    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion in next year’s Net­ball Su­per League (NSL) is set to be taken up a notch as the league will feature for­eign na­tional teams for the first time.</p>
    <p>Brunei and Thai­land will join six teams – five clubs and Net­ball Sin­ga­pore (NS) se­lec­tion team Mis­sion Man­nas – in the sec­ond round of the tour­na­ment on Feb 23, said NS chief ex­ec­u­tive Cyrus Me­dora yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The league, the high­est level of com­pe­ti­tion in Sin­ga­pore, is slated to start on Jan 23, sub­ject to ap­proval from the au­thor­i­ties amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Me­dora was speak­ing at on­line event The Court­side, which was streamed live on the NS Face­book page. Other speak­ers in­cluded na­tional net­ball cap­tain Char­maine Soh, head coach An­nette Bishop and sports busi­ness group leader for Deloitte South-east Asia (SEA) James Wal­ton.</p>
    <p>Me­dora, 69, said the pres­ence of for­eign na­tional teams presents a higher level of com­pe­ti­tion for lo­cal clubs and will help the de­vel­op­ment of net­ball in the re­gion so it be­comes a main­stay at the SEA Games.</p>
    <p>Brunei and Thai­land were joint­bronze medal win­ners in the past three edi­tions of the bi­en­nial Games. Malaysia are two-time de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons while Sin­ga­pore won gold on home soil in 2015 af­ter the sport emerged from a sixedi­tion hia­tus at the Games.</p>
    <p>The news was well-re­ceived by play­ers and coaches.</p>
    <p>Blaze Dolphins coach Wang Jing Qing, who won the ti­tle thrice, told The Straits Times: “It’s good ex­po­sure for the play­ers be­cause they won’t nor­mally get to play against other na­tional teams and these teams might have a dif­fer­ent way of play­ing. The speed of the game will also be dif­fer­ent so it’s good ex­pe­ri­ence for the play­ers to learn to adapt and train their de­ci­sion mak­ing on court.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional vice-cap­tain Aqi­lah Andin, 24, who plays for Swifts Bar­racu­das, said: “For the na­tional play­ers, it’s also ad­van­ta­geous be­cause we get to an­a­lyse bet­ter for fu­ture com­pe­ti­tions when we play against them.”</p>
    <p>Other plans for next year in­clude a test se­ries each against Malaysia and Sri Lanka, and a re­vamped Na­tions Cup fea­tur­ing five teams in­stead of the usual six: two Sin­ga­pore sides – the na­tional Opens and A-teams – and three for­eign na­tional teams.</p>
    <p>Bishop said this will en­cour­age more play­ers to want to get in­volved and gain more ex­pe­ri­ence, pro­mot­ing healthy com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The New Zealan­der added: “This helps to build that base of younger play­ers who get to have a taste of what it’s like against an in­ter­na­tional team... It hard­ens them up as well be­cause they’ll know what it means to play at that level. They’ll know what they need to be do­ing off court and learn to con­di­tion them­selves to be com­pet­i­tive at that level.”</p>
    <p>Soh said these matches will be a good chance for the na­tional team to play a match to­gether. The team formed af­ter this year’s NSL ended pre­ma­turely in March be­cause of the pan­demic and have not played a full-court game to­gether.</p>
    <p>The next tour­na­ment is likely to be the 2021 Asian In­door and Mar­tial Arts Games (Aimag) in Thai­land next May.</p>
    <p>Soh, 30, said: “It also gives the play­ers in the A squad some­thing to look for­ward to be­cause they usu­ally train very hard but don’t go for com­pe­ti­tions. Now there’s a target for them.”</p>
    <p>But de­spite be­ing lim­ited to five play­ers a court, Soh noted that morale was still high among her team­mates, who are aim­ing for gold at the Aimag.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bless­ing in dis­guise be­cause now we get to train our stamina and go back to ba­sics and do things we would not have worked on if ev­ery­thing had gone on as planned,” she said.</p>
