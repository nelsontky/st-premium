    <p>It is sex, drugs and fi­nance in the new Bri­tish drama, In­dus­try, which casts a crit­i­cal yet sym­pa­thetic eye over those who work in in­vest­ment bank­ing – a some­what re­viled pro­fes­sion since the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>First-time tele­vi­sion cre­ators Mickey Down and Kon­rad Kay once worked in fi­nance them­selves and hated their jobs.</p>
    <p>And this was the in­spi­ra­tion for their tale of five 20some­things vy­ing for per­ma­nent po­si­tions at a top Lon­don in­vest­ment bank, fu­elled by am­bi­tion and he­do­nism, and oc­ca­sion­ally sell­ing their souls.</p>
    <p>The pair spoke to The Straits Times and other press about the show, which airs on HBO Go and HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420), with new episodes ev­ery Tues­day at 11am and 11pm.</p>
    <p>It is co-pro­duced by Lena Dun­ham, cre­ator of the Em­my­win­ning drama Girls (2012 to 2017), who also di­rects the first episode.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing by video call from Lon­don, Kay and Down note that many peo­ple think of in­vest­ment bankers and traders as un­savoury char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>But Kay says they sought to steer away from that ex­pec­ta­tion and the idea that “it’s a cold world full of cold char­ac­ters”.</p>
    <p>“What we’ve tried to do with our char­ac­ters is show they all have a vul­ner­a­bil­ity and in­se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“That’s not to say they don’t do morally com­pro­mised things and act in self­ish ways. But it was al­ways a char­ac­ter-driven show for us – not a fi­nance or plot­driven show about in­sider trad­ing, or how greed leads to peo­ple steal­ing money.”</p>
    <p>The se­ries asks why money is a pri­or­ity for each char­ac­ter and probes is­sues of gen­der, race, class and priv­i­lege in this cut-throat pro­fes­sion, which of­ten presents it­self as per­fectly mer­i­to­cratic.</p>
    <p>“Who are th­ese peo­ple and why is money im­por­tant to them? So it was very im­por­tant that they all have a very dif­fer­ent so­cioe­co­nomic back­ground,” says Kay.</p>
    <p>And un­like many sto­ries set in this world, In­dus­try ex­am­ines it through the eyes of young peo­ple en­ter­ing it for the first time.</p>
    <p>Down ad­mits this is partly be­cause he and Kay were in their 20s when they be­gan writ­ing to­gether and needed to vent about their ex­pe­ri­ences in fi­nance.</p>
    <p>“The first few things we wrote were ex­plo­rations of be­ing in your 20s and the first thing we wrote to­gether af­ter we left fi­nance was a bank­ing drama that shares some DNA with In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“It was ter­ri­bly writ­ten,” he re­calls. “There were 10-page scenes of peo­ple called Mickey and Kon­rad talk­ing to­gether about how much they hated their jobs. But it was a cathar­tic ex­er­cise.”</p>
    <p>When the duo were ap­proached to write this show, they de­cided to take a dif­fer­ent tack.</p>
    <p>“Our im­me­di­ate re­ac­tion was that most bank­ing dra­mas are usu­ally quite de­riv­a­tive of oth­ers, and that ev­ery­thing about that world had been said,” Down says.</p>
    <p>But they were urged to draw on their own ex­pe­ri­ences and create a “mid-20s re­la­tion­ship and char­ac­ter-driven drama” set in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“That’s what un­locked In­dus­try for us”, he says. “Be­cause in the past, fic­tion about bank­ing was usu­ally fo­cused on the peo­ple at the top, but go­ing in from the bot­tom was the way to do it.”</p>
    <p>He and Kay were also in­ter­ested in the role “that chance plays in a ca­reer”, es­pe­cially for young peo­ple just start­ing out.</p>
    <p>“You can come into any in­dus­try, and if the per­son im­me­di­ately re­spon­si­ble for you takes a dis­like to you, or feels you are some­one to look down on, bully or abuse, your ca­reer can go in a very dif­fer­ent di­rec­tion than if some­one had cham­pi­oned you.”</p>
    <p>The se­ries, how­ever, also shows th­ese young as­pir­ing bankers par­ty­ing like there is no to­mor­row – and Down con­cedes that some view­ers may see this as en­tic­ing and glam­orous.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral films set on Wall Street, es­pe­cially dur­ing its hey­day, “ac­tu­ally ended up be­ing in­cred­i­bly good re­cruit­ment tools for the in­dus­try”, he ob­serves.</p>
    <p>“But Kon­rad and I wanted to present the world with as much au­then­tic­ity as pos­si­ble, draw from our own ex­pe­ri­ences and al­low the au­di­ence to make up their minds with­out us moral­is­ing or be­ing too di­dac­tic.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter watch­ing the whole show, the viewer will have no doubt where the writ­ers stand.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter eight episodes, whether we think it’s an ed­i­fy­ing or toxic en­vi­ron­ment is clear.”</p>

    <p>In­dus­try airs on HBO Go and HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420), with new episodes ev­ery Tues­day at 11am and 11pm.</p>
