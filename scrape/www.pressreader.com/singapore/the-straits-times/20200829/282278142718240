    <p>OCBC Bank has asked the High Court to place KS En­ergy and its prin­ci­pal sub­sidiary KS Drilling un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment but the trou­bled offshore and marine group is sug­gest­ing an al­ter­na­tive so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The move came af­ter the bank sent let­ters of demand to KS En­ergy, KS Drilling and six other sub­sidiaries for a US$230.7 mil­lion (S$314 mil­lion) se­cured term loan and a S$5 mil­lion un­se­cured bridg­ing loan, both owed by KS Drilling.</p>
    <p>KS Drilling is an 80.09 per cent-owned sub­sidiary of KS En­ergy.</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy said it gave US$150 mil­lion in guar­an­tees for the term loan, al­though the other sub­sidiaries’ guar­an­tees are “much less”.</p>
    <p>OCBC wants to ap­point Deloitte & Touche staff An­drew Grim­mett and Lim Loo Khoo as in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers, pend­ing the court hear­ing, KS En­ergy said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The court hear­ing for the in­terim ju­di­cial man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tion will take place next Mon­day while the pre-trial con­fer­ence is set for Sept 10.</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy has re­sponded to OCBC’s ap­pli­ca­tion with an al­ter­na­tive pro­posal that will al­low the bank to “fully mon­i­tor and su­per­vise” all its busi­ness op­er­a­tions. Th­ese mea­sures will give the lender “all the trans­parency, con­trol and pro­tec­tion it re­quests with­out hav­ing the ad­verse ef­fects on the pledged as­sets that a ju­di­cial man­age­ment scheme brings”, KS En­ergy said.</p>
    <p>It added that the rigs pledged to OCBC are in “no jeop­ardy from other par­ties”, and dis­puted the need for an in­terim ju­di­cial man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tion as there is no risk to as­sets.</p>
    <p>KS Drilling’s li­a­bil­ity un­der the term loan is se­cured by se­cu­ri­ties, in­clud­ing mort­gages over some of its jack-up and land rigs in favour of OCBC.</p>
    <p>“The pro­posed ju­di­cial man­agers are not bet­ter placed than the present man­age­ment to con­tinue the com­pany’s busi­ness so as to safe­guard its and its cred­i­tors’ in­ter­ests,” KS En­ergy said.</p>
    <p>“There is no ev­i­dence of the com­pany be­hav­ing fraud­u­lently at the ex­pense of the cred­i­tors.”</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy group chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Wiluan said the group had been fac­ing un­prece­dented chal­lenges, af­ter the oil price col­lapse and sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He added that KS En­ergy has taken ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing cut­ting costs, over the past two years to im­prove its fi­nan­cial po­si­tion, “re­sult­ing in a 72 per cent re­duc­tion in loss for the first six months ended June 30 com­pared with the pre­vi­ous cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wiluan took the helm af­ter his fa­ther, In­done­sian ty­coon Kris Wiluan, stepped down in mid-Au­gust as group chair­man and CEO.</p>
    <p>The older man faces 112 charges of al­leged false trad­ing and mar­ket rig­ging for share pur­chases made be­tween 2014 and 2016.</p>
    <p>KS En­ergy has said that those were per­sonal deals and sep­a­rate from the group’s fi­nan­cial woes.</p>
    <p>Early this month, the firm said it was stand­ing by Kris Wiluan’s suit­abil­ity as chair­man and CEO.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing in KS En­ergy stock has been sus­pended since Aug 12.</p>
