    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • The Bos­ton Celtics-Philadel­phia 76ers matchup is the old­est ri­valry in the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA). But many crit­ics be­lieve it is no longer a com­pet­i­tive one.</p>
    <p>Since los­ing the East­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals in 1982, the Celtics have won five straight play-off se­ries, though their dom­i­nance went to the next level on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Never be­fore in 14 pre­vi­ous meet­ings had there been a sweep, and af­ter fall­ing to a 110-106 Game 4 loss at Dis­ney World, the Sixers are fac­ing a pos­si­ble break-up of their team as a con­se­quence.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing failed to take Philadel­phia be­yond the sec­ond round for the third suc­ces­sive year, coach Brett Brown will re­port­edly be fired.</p>
    <p>All-Star Joel Em­biid, who paced his team with 30 points, has also hinted his fu­ture may lie else­where.</p>
    <p>“I don’t make the de­ci­sions. I’m here in Philly. What­ever hap­pens, hap­pens,” said the cen­tre. “I’ve al­ways said that I want to end my ca­reer here, and if it hap­pens, good. If it doesn’t hap­pen, well, you move on and all that stuff.</p>
    <p>“We could never find a rhythm this year. It is dis­ap­point­ing. There are a lot of re­grets.”</p>
    <p>Brown could only lament the sea­son-end­ing in­jury to All-Star guard Ben Simmons – he played no part against the Celtics – as some­thing that will “res­onate for a long time”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the di­vide that ex­ists within the team was clear as Josh Richard­son later called on his coach to “have some more ac­count­abil­ity” for his fail­ures. In con­trast, the Celtics are go­ing from strength to strength.</p>
    <p>Kemba Walker, who left the Char­lotte Hor­nets last sum­mer af­ter eight sea­sons, led all scor­ers with 32 points to book his first ap­pear­ance in the sec­ond round and the All-Star guard said that this was “the rea­son I came to Bos­ton”.</p>
    <p>He added: “That’s why I’m here for. To play high-level bas­ket­ball each and every night.”</p>
    <p>A high-level match-up is what Walker will get as the Celtics next face the Toronto Rap­tors in the East semi-fi­nals, with Game 1 start­ing on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The NBA cham­pi­ons com­pleted their own sweep of the Brook­lyn Nets with a 150-122 vic­tory in Game 4.</p>
    <p>Re­serve guard Nor­man Pow­ell, who stepped in af­ter All-Star team­mate Kyle Lowry got in­jured just three min­utes into the first quar­ter, paced his team with a ca­reer play­off high 29 points as Toronto recorded their first-ever sweep.</p>
    <p>On the Celtics, cen­tre Serge Ibaka, who added 27 points, said: “They are play­ing some of the best bas­ket­ball right now... We know it’s not gonna be easy.”</p>
