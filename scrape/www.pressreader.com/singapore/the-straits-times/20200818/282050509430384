    <p>Pi­lots and cabin crew work­ing for Sin­ga­pore car­ri­ers will be rou­tinely tested for Covid-19 from Thurs­day upon their re­turn from over­seas.</p>
    <p>This is part of stepped-up pre­cau­tions to guard against the spread of the coro­n­avirus in the com­mu­nity, the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Ex­ist­ing pro­to­cols have been ef­fec­tive in keep­ing air­crew of Sin­ga­pore car­ri­ers safe as there have been no pos­i­tive Covid-19 cases among air­crew of Sin­ga­pore car­ri­ers for more than three months,” said CAAS.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, there is a need for con­tin­ued vig­i­lance and Covid-19 test­ing will pro­vide added as­sur­ance for crew, their fam­i­lies and the gen­eral pub­lic that any im­ported in­fec­tion can be quickly de­tected, and given nec­es­sary med­i­cal treat­ment promptly.”</p>
    <p>The last time flight staff were re­ported to have tested pos­i­tive was when Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) said in April that three cabin crew mem­bers and a “tech crew mem­ber”, a term for pi­lots, were in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The new test­ing re­quire­ment ap­plies to the air­crew of the four lo­cal air­lines – SIA, SilkAir, Scoot and Jet­star Asia.</p>
    <p>The crew will be tested us­ing the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test, which is the test­ing stan­dard used glob­ally to di­ag­nose if some­one is cur­rently in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>CAAS said that air­crew of Sin­ga­pore car­ri­ers re­turn­ing from re­gions where trav­ellers are al­lowed to serve their stay-home no­tices at their own ac­com­mo­da­tion will be ex­empt</p>
    <p>There is a need for con­tin­ued vig­i­lance and Covid-19 test­ing will pro­vide added as­sur­ance for crew, their fam­i­lies and the gen­eral pub­lic that any im­ported in­fec­tion can be quickly de­tected, and given nec­es­sary med­i­cal treat­ment promptly.</p>
    <p>AN ADDED AS­SUR­ANCE</p>
    <p>from Covid-19 test­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, air­crew that had trav­elled to main­land China and South Korea will not need to be tested upon their re­turn to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pi­lots and cabin crew have been tak­ing pre­cau­tions while work­ing, in­clud­ing don­ning masks on flights.</p>
    <p>They also do not leave the air­craft over­seas when work­ing on turn­around flights.</p>
    <p>In a lay­over, they wear masks, ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and remain in their crew ac­com­mo­da­tion at all times.</p>
    <p>They must be fer­ried be­tween the air­port and their ac­com­mo­da­tion in ded­i­cated trans­port.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have been espe­cially vig­i­lant in some sec­tors, such as con­struc­tion, where the in­ci­dence of pos­i­tive Covid-19 re­sults was high.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the dis­cov­ery of an in­fec­tion clus­ter at Bukit Pan­jang’s trans­port cen­tre last month, of­fi­cials an­nounced plans to screen around 11,000 peo­ple work­ing in pub­lic bus de­pots and in­ter­changes.</p>
    <p>These in­clude all bus driv­ers as well as em­ploy­ees such as ad­min­is­tra­tive staff.</p>
