    <p>Not con­tent with sim­ply meet­ing the ba­sic re­quire­ments for grad­u­a­tion, Mr Daryl Jude Lawrence’s pas­sion for med­i­cal di­ag­nos­tic de­vices prompted him to choose a daunt­ing re­search project in his fi­nal year.</p>
    <p>He clocked long hours in the lab­o­ra­tory at Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don work­ing on a graphene field ef­fect tran­sis­tor – a di­ag­nos­tic de­vice to de­tect cell par­ti­cles that could in­di­cate the pres­ence of can­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Lawrence, 25, who grad­u­ated last year with a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in ma­te­ri­als science and en­gi­neer­ing, will soon be­gin a joint PhD pro­gramme in bio­engi­neer­ing at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berkeley and the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he was one of 66 re­cip­i­ents of the A*Star Schol­ar­ships, awarded by the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search since 2001 to grow the lo­cal sci­en­tific tal­ent base for the re­search, in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>His jour­ney would have been very dif­fer­ent with­out the Na­tional Science Schol­ar­ship he re­ceived for his un­der­grad­u­ate stud­ies, and which will now sup­port his PhD.</p>
    <p>“The schol­ar­ship pro­vided me with ac­cess to top labs that helped me re­alise my pas­sion in medtech. I also un­der­took sev­eral re­search at­tach­ments at A*Star, dur­ing which I gained in­valu­able re­search ex­pe­ri­ence and was ex­posed to the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion side of the prod­uct de­vel­op­ment equa­tion,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, who was guest of hon­our at the vir­tual schol­ar­ship award cer­e­mony, re­it­er­ated the na­tion’s com­mit­ment to in­vest­ing in peo­ple, even when times are tough. He said: “We con­tinue with our in­vest­ments through all the dif­fi­cult mo­ments to make sure that there is a sus­tain­able pipe­line of tal­ent for the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>An­other Na­tional Science Schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ent, Ms Tan Yee Lin, 19, de­vel­oped a novel an­tibac­te­rial sur­face with zinc ox­ide nanos­truc­tures that kill mi­crobes in a rel­a­tively short time.</p>
    <p>Her in­ven­tion, which po­ten­tially could be ap­plied to fre­quently touched sur­faces such as hand rail­ings and lift but­tons, won her one of the top three awards in the mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy cat­e­gory of the In­tel In­ter­na­tional Science and En­gi­neer­ing Fair in Ari­zona last year. She will study ma­te­ri­als science and en­gi­neer­ing at Im­pe­rial Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Ms Nur Ayu Afira Sutris­noh, 26, a re­cip­i­ent of the A*Star Grad­u­ate Schol­ar­ship, aims to cre­ate ma­te­ri­als for the clean en­ergy in­dus­try. She will pur­sue a doc­tor­ate in ma­te­ri­als science and en­gi­neer­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said the science and tech­nol­ogy scene here needs to con­tinue to build sys­tems, net­works and com­mu­ni­ties de­spite the chal­lenges of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess in the coun­try’s re­search and de­vel­op­ment lies in how ag­ile those sys­tems are, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Suc­cess, to me, is not just about de­liv­er­ing so­lu­tions to known prob­lems in peace­time. Suc­cess must also mean de­liv­er­ing so­lu­tions in cri­sis sit­u­a­tions like Covid, and hav­ing the ca­pa­bil­i­ties to deal with prob­lems that may not have emerged at this point,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also warned against com­pla­cency and in­su­lar­ity. Not­ing how sci­en­tists here worked closely with re­search net­works world­wide to fight Covid-19, he said: “Our phi­los­o­phy re­mains that we must re­main con­nected to the rest of the world in or­der for us to cross-pol­li­nate ideas and ex­change ideas with oth­ers, so that we are never alone in try­ing to find any so­lu­tion.”</p>
