    <p>MPs in Par­lia­ment have got down to busi­ness to tackle the coun­try’s worst cri­sis since in­de­pen­dence. Is­sues cru­cial to Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic and so­cial fu­ture are be­ing ad­dressed with the ur­gency and de­lib­er­a­tion that they re­quire at this crit­i­cal junc­ture. The need to sus­tain a Sin­ga­porean labour core, the need to bal­ance the greater de­mands on so­cial se­cu­rity with fis­cal sus­tain­abil­ity and re­spon­si­bil­ity to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions, and ad­her­ence to so­ci­etal val­ues are themes around which the Govern­ment and the op­po­si­tion have found com­mon ground to unite on at a time when the coun­try needs con­struc­tive pol­i­tics of the high­est or­der. This en­sures that peo­ple’s con­cerns are clearly heard, and ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore core is not a new idea, of course. It has been at the heart of pol­i­cy­mak­ing since in­de­pen­dence. How­ever, a grow­ing global econ­omy has ne­ces­si­tated the en­try of for­eign labour on a large scale to help power the coun­try’s ca­pac­ity for the ex­port of goods and ser­vices. But the se­vere con­trac­tion of ex­ter­nal de­mand has re­quired an ac­com­pa­ny­ing re­cal­i­bra­tion of the pres­ence of for­eign labour. It will still be needed, although Sin­ga­pore­ans must not be un­fairly dis­ad­van­taged in an in­creas­ingly com­pet­i­tive labour mar­ket. The sen­ti­ments raised in Par­lia­ment – on the need to pre­vent er­rant em­ploy­ers from get­ting around al­ready en­hanced en­try re­quire­ments for for­eign­ers – are an in­di­ca­tion of shift­ing pub­lic mood.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the is­sue of for­eign work­ers, the no­tion of so­cial se­cu­rity will need to be recon­cep­tu­alised, not only in the light of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but also be­cause of long­stand­ing job dis­rup­tions caused by wide­spread adop­tion of tech­nol­ogy across economies. It is im­por­tant for MPs to have an open mind on pro­pos­als, whether on a min­i­mum wage or un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance. Ideas may ap­pear fea­si­ble, but will come at a cost. In keep­ing with the fis­cal pru­dence prac­tised since in­de­pen­dence, Par­lia­ment will need to at­tune its de­ci­sions and its re­spon­si­bil­i­ties not just to the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans, but also to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions, who must not be left with a legacy of painful debt to pay off.</p>
    <p>MPs seem alive to the de­sire among Sin­ga­pore­ans for more de­bate on the best way for­ward. Thank­fully, though, the lead­ers of all par­ties have made plain that they will up­hold the na­tional in­ter­est, rather than en­gag­ing in par­ti­san one-up­man­ship. The new Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh, also spelt out not only what he thought should change in the coun­try, but also what should not, in­clud­ing its com­mit­ment to mul­tira­cial­ism and a firm stance against cor­rup­tion. That is for the good. The broader and deeper the con­sen­sus on Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal re­al­i­ties and core in­ter­ests, the more room there might be for rea­soned and ro­bust de­bates on how best to se­cure its fu­ture.</p>
