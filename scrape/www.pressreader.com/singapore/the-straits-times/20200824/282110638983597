    <p>An over­head link bridge that con­nects two build­ings sit­ting on op­po­site sides of a road may sound sim­ple to build, but ask any en­gi­neer and he will tell you that it takes a lot of pre­cise engi­neer­ing cal­cu­la­tions to make it hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Add con­served build­ings – whose fa­cade must not be med­dled with – to the mix and the al­ready com­pli­cated job be­comes ex­ceed­ingly chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>Such was the sit­u­a­tion Mr Aaron Foong, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of KTP Con­sul­tants, a mem­ber of Sur­bana Jurong Group, found him­self in at the start of 2018.</p>
    <p>His team was tasked with de­sign­ing and con­struct­ing a 20m-long over­head bridge to con­nect Maxwell Cham­bers Suites – for­merly known as Red Dot Traf­fic Build­ing – to Maxwell Cham­bers across the street.</p>
    <p>Mr Foong’s so­lu­tion? A novel Zpro­file steel brace.</p>
    <p>When bonded with the in­te­grated frame on the fa­cades of the build­ings, the Z-pro­file steel brace could sup­port both ex­ist­ing loads and that of the over­head link bridge with­out re­quir­ing any mod­i­fi­ca­tions to the fa­cades.</p>
    <p>For his innovative so­lu­tion, the 40-year-old will be one of four pro­fes­sional engi­neers to be awarded the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity’s (BCA) De­sign and Engi­neer­ing Safety Award this year.</p>
    <p>The four award win­ners were an­nounced by the BCA yes­ter­day. The award recog­nises pro­fes­sional engi­neers and their teams for their innovative de­signs and engi­neer­ing so­lu­tions to chal­leng­ing projects.</p>
    <p>“It is a sus­tain­able way to achieve an el­e­gant out­come,” said Mr Foong, whose team de­cided to es­chew the more “com­mon” way of us­ing steel beams to prop up the bridge.</p>
    <p>“We could eas­ily have added an ad­di­tional col­umn but it would not have matched the fi­nal in­tent of pre­serv­ing the her­itage of the two build­ings, which was im­por­tant to us.”</p>
    <p>Both build­ings were granted con­ser­va­tion sta­tus by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity in 2007.</p>
    <p>While the whole project took 1½ years to com­plete, the in­stal­la­tion of the over­head link bridge was done in one night to min­imise traf­fic dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other win­ning project that had to be com­pleted fast and with min­i­mal dis­rup­tions was the Singapore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) Con­nex­ion, a net-zero en­ergy teach­ing block in the city.</p>
    <p>Mr Kam Mun Wai, 53, se­nior ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Mein­hardt Singapore, took on the chal­lenge and com­pleted the project – from pil­ing to con­struc­tion to in­te­rior de­sign works – in 15 months.</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer was given the award for his use of an innovative hy­brid steel and cross lam­i­nated tim­ber (CLT) sys­tem, which uses pre­fab­ri­cated mod­u­lar col­umn-beam steel frames for the main build­ing struc­tures.</p>
    <p>Mr Kam said the sys­tem of­fered a “quick and ef­fi­cient” in­stal­la­tion process and could mit­i­gate the chal­lenges of on-site space con­straints.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar hy­brid steel-CLT so­lu­tion was used in build­ing a two­s­torey link build­ing which con­nects SMU Con­nex­ion to the School of Law over the busy Fort Can­ning Link car­riage­way.</p>
    <p>The en­tire struc­ture, which was pre­fab­ri­cated, was com­pleted in a record time of seven days. It would have taken around 1½ months if done in the con­ven­tional method.</p>
    <p>Two other award win­ners, Mr Ja­son Tan Bok Leng and Mr Tan Yoong Heng, both from Arup Singapore, will also be recog­nised for their engi­neer­ing achieve­ments – in the Ou­tram Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal and Thom­son-East Coast Line Wood­lands sta­tion projects, re­spec­tively.</p>
