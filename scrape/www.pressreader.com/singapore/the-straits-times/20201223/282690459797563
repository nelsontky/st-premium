    <p>We were taught to be kind to oth­ers, but when was the last time you were kind to your­self?</p>
    <p>If you find your­self nod­ding to this, it is time to pri­ori­tise some nec­es­sary acts of self-care.</p>
    <p>“Show­ing your­self a lack of com­pas­sion is not good for your men­tal and emo­tional well-be­ing,” says hap­pi­ness coach and au­thor of The Kind­ness Pact, Domonique Ber­tolucci.</p>
    <p>“Self-com­pas­sion is about giv­ing your­self the same love and re­spect you of­fer the other im­por­tant peo­ple in your life.”</p>
    <p>Not only will you re­alise that you de­serve this ex­tra kind­ness, but self-com­pas­sion can also help to re­duce stress, build con­fi­dence and put you on the path to a hap­pier, health­ier life­style.</p>
    <p>Here are five sim­ple acts of self-care to start prac­tis­ing now.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>LIS­TEN AND TREAT TO YOUR IT KINDLY BODY’S NEEDS</p>
    <p>When you feel rest­less or out of sorts, ask your­self: What is the most nur­tur­ing thing I can do for my­self?</p>
    <p>“Some­times, your body might need to go for a walk. Other times, you just need to sit still or stay in bed,” Ber­tolucci ex­plains.</p>
    <p>Do not push your­self just be­cause you think you should – if your body is telling you it needs rest, it is usu­ally for a good rea­son.</p>
    <p>Ber­tolucci says: “I know so many peo­ple who feel like they are com­ing down with some­thing, so they go out and ex­er­cise. But that is not what you need when you have a cold.”</p>
    <p>Try to aim for a lit­tle quiet time away from the fam­ily, or give your own neck, feet and hands a lit­tle self-mas­sage.</p>
    <p>2 STOP START BE­ING BE­ING SELF-CRIT­I­CAL, COM­PAS­SION­ATE</p>
    <p>Avoid self-judg­ment and si­lence that nig­gling voice in your head that keeps say­ing neg­a­tive things about you.</p>
    <p>A huge part of prac­tis­ing self­com­pas­sion is to re­mem­ber that you are in con­trol of ig­nor­ing or lis­ten­ing to that un­help­ful voice at any time.</p>
    <p>“When you hear neg­a­tive thoughts and crit­i­cism, do not get caught up in a de­bate with them,” says Ber­tolucci.</p>
    <p>In­stead, dis­tract your­self by re­flect­ing on your good qual­i­ties. Re­mind your­self that you are a suc­cess­ful and lov­ing per­son.</p>
    <p>This is the first step to stop­ping harsh self-crit­i­cism and ac­knowl­edg­ing that neg­a­tive self-talk is an ex­pres­sion of your fears and in­se­cu­ri­ties – and should not be taken as a fac­tual as­sess­ment of you or your sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>UP­LIFT AND POS­I­TIVE YOUR­SELF THINK­ING WITH PRAISE</p>
    <p>You do not ex­pect oth­ers to be flaw­less, so why hold your­self to ridicu­lously high stan­dards of per­fec­tion, which goes against the prin­ci­ples of self-com­pas­sion?</p>
    <p>In­stead of blam­ing your­self the next time some­thing goes wrong, try treat­ing your­self the same way you would a dear friend.</p>
    <p>Ber­tolucci says: “Be­fore you beat your­self up, stop and think: If some­one came and told me this, what would I tell them?”</p>
    <p>Think about the choice of en­cour­ag­ing words and sentiments you would use to re­as­sure a friend in a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion, and the type of gen­tle ad­vice and sup­port you would of­fer him or her. Then play those words back to your­self.</p>
    <p>4 STEP ZONE OUT AND OF TRY YOUR SOME­THING COM­FORT NEW</p>
    <p>When was the last time you chal­lenged your­self?</p>
    <p>Stud­ies show your self-es­teem does not get an op­por­tu­nity to grow stronger when you are stuck in a rut.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when you make the choice to chal­lenge your­self with new ac­tiv­i­ties, you give your self­es­teem an in­cred­i­ble boost.</p>
    <p>It does not have to be any­thing too out­landish – do not feel pres­sured to belly-dance or sky­dive. It can be some­thing as sim­ple as ditch­ing a tried-and-true lunch venue to try a new one.</p>
    <p>One of Ber­tolucci’s favourite chal­lenges is to take a book to a cafe and sit down to eat solo.</p>
    <p>“Some­thing like this makes you re­alise you are more adapt­able and flex­i­ble than you thought,” she says.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>RE­FLECT ON THE PAST, GLEAN LES­SONS FOR THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>It can be tough to re­mem­ber to stop and smell the roses, but it is im­por­tant to be men­tally dis­ci­plined and fo­cus on liv­ing in the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple do not learn from the past or have hope for the fu­ture, they can get caught up in all kinds of worry,” Ber­tolucci says.</p>
    <p>“When you find your­self think­ing about an event in the past, ask your­self: What did I learn from it? What can I do dif­fer­ently next time?</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, when you are think­ing about the fu­ture, rather than en­gag­ing in a cy­cle of worry, ask your­self: What can I do to make my de­sired out­come be­come a re­al­ity?”</p>
    <p>Take a proac­tive ap­proach to prob­lems in­stead of let­ting worry build. For ex­am­ple, if your health con­cerns you, try to re­mem­ber when your last check-up was – and book one. Be­ing kinder and more com­pas­sion­ate to your­self will leave you feel­ing bet­ter in more ways than one.</p>
