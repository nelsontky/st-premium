    <p>• A Chi­nese court said yes­ter­day it had sen­tenced a Cana­dian to death for trans­port­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing drugs, the sec­ond Cana­dian in two days to re­ceive the death penalty for drugs and the fourth since Canada de­tained a top Huawei ex­ec­u­tive in 2018.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween China and Canada de­te­ri­o­rated sharply af­ter Cana­dian po­lice de­tained Huawei Tech­nolo­gies chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Meng Wanzhou in Van­cou­ver on a war­rant from the United States.</p>
    <p>Asked if the sen­tenc­ing of the Cana­dian drug of­fend­ers was linked to Meng’s case, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a brief­ing yes­ter­day that China’s ju­di­cial or­gans “han­dle cases in­de­pen­dently”, while also adding that “the Cana­dian side knows the root cause” of dif­fi­cul­ties in China-Canada re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Ye Jian­hui, a Cana­dian na­tional, was sen­tenced af­ter a trial in the south­ern city of Foshan, the Foshan In­ter­me­di­ate Peo­ple’s Court said in a no­tice on its web­site. Po­lice found 218kg of white crys­tals con­tain­ing MDMA, com­monly known as ec­stasy, in the room used by Ye and five other men, ac­cord­ing to a lo­cal me­dia re­port.</p>
    <p>Of the other five men, all Chi­nese na­tion­als, one was sen­tenced to death, while the rest were given jail sen­tences rang­ing from seven years to life, ac­cord­ing to the court no­tice.</p>
    <p>The sen­tenc­ing of Ye and his ac­com­plices came just one day af­ter an­other Chi­nese court sen­tenced Cana­dian Xu Wei­hong to death for mak­ing drugs.</p>
    <p>China last year sen­tenced Cana­di­ans Robert Lloyd Schel­len­berg and Fan Wei to death on drug charges in sep­a­rate cases. Both men have lodged ap­peals.</p>
    <p>“Canada re­quests clemency for all Cana­dian cit­i­zens who have been sen­tenced to death, and calls on China to grant clemency to Mr Xu,” said the Cana­dian For­eign Min­istry spokesman John Bab­cock.</p>
    <p>China-Canada re­la­tions quickly soured af­ter Meng’s ar­rest. Two other Cana­dian men – busi­ness­man Michael Spa­vor and for­mer diplo­mat Michael Kovrig – were de­tained in China days af­ter Meng’s ar­rest, and were charged two months ago with es­pi­onage. China has de­nied that their ar­rests were linked to Meng’s case.</p>
