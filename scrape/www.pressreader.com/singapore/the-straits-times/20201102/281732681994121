    <p>Be­lea­guered Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin was ex­pected to have the fight of his life to se­cure the pas­sage of Bud­get 2021 this month, amid per­sis­tent as­saults on what is the slimmest par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity in Malaysian his­tory.</p>
    <p>But whether the Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia pres­i­dent still re­tains the sup­port of the 113 MPs – out of the 222-strong Par­lia­ment – that form the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact ap­pears moot for now, with fed­eral law­mak­ers un­likely to defy the palace’s call to en­sure gov­ern­ment spend­ing is ap­proved to fight off the blight of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Yet it is only a tem­po­rary life­line for Tan Sri Muhyid­din, as dis­gruntle­ment in his largest ally, Umno, con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net made a con­tro­ver­sial re­quest for emer­gency pow­ers on Oct 23 that would have avoided the need to hold an up­com­ing by-elec­tion in Sabah, as well as state polls in Sarawak, amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said the move would have also shielded Mr Muhyid­din from a bud­get vote and po­ten­tial na­tional bal­lot if he lost.</p>
    <p>The King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ahmad Shah, re­fused the re­quest, and in­stead called on MPs to back the bud­get to en­sure the bat­tle against the virus re­mains well funded.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s nine hered­i­tary state rulers – who take turns to be the coun­try’s king – are revered, and de­spite them be­ing con­sti­tu­tional mon­archs, their state­ments are widely in­ter­preted as de­crees.</p>
    <p>“If the emer­gency was meant to avoid de­feat in a sup­ply Bill and pos­si­ble snap polls, then the royal pres­sure has nearly the same ef­fect, al­beit, with some em­bar­rass­ment for the Premier,” risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group’s Asia direc­tor Peter Mum­ford told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment re­con­venes to­day for six weeks, with the bud­get to be tabled on Fri­day. Over two dozen con­fi­dence mo­tions have also been sub­mit­ted, but are un­likely to see the light of day as the Speaker will pri­ori­tise gov­ern­ment busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the greater threat to Mr Muhyid­din comes from out­side the leg­is­la­ture, with Umno de­mand­ing more say in the ad­min­is­tra­tion and threat­en­ing to with­draw sup­port to get what it wants.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal in­sid­ers say Umno’s list of de­mands in­clude a Cabi­net reshuf­fle which hands it the deputy premier­ship and key port­fo­lios, and the for­ma­tion of a pres­i­den­tial coun­cil of PN chiefs to con­fer on ma­jor de­ci­sions be­fore they are adopted as gov­ern­ment pol­icy.</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cial sources told ST that Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia lead­ers are re­sist­ing a Cabi­net reshuf­fle – although they are amenable to a pres­i­den­tial coun­cil – as ac­ced­ing would mean “we will keep hav­ing to bow to threats”.</p>
    <p>For now, the once-dom­i­nant Malay party has no choice but to work within the PN frame­work to avoid be­ing blamed for trig­ger­ing snap elec­tions which could ex­ac­er­bate the surge in Covid-19 cases, which more than dou­bled last month alone.</p>
    <p>Umno has in­sisted that snap polls to end the po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty must be held once Covid-19 in­fec­tions are min­imised, but ST has learnt that a bi­par­ti­san com­mit­tee is look­ing into a pos­si­ble con­fi­dence and sup­ply agree­ment that would en­sure Mr Muhyid­din re­mains in power.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers in the talks said terms are still be­ing ne­go­ti­ated, but it could mean prop­ping up the Premier un­til just be­fore Par­lia­ment’s term ends in 2023.</p>
    <p>Umno’s in­sis­tence that snap polls should be held once the pan­demic ta­pers off could shorten or scup­per such a deal.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, the party could choose to ex­clude its 39 MPs from any such ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Should dis­cus­sions col­lapse, then all bets are off af­ter the sched­uled de­bate on the bud­get ends on Dec 10, es­pe­cially if the virus out­break is back un­der con­trol. For this rea­son, Mr Muhyid­din will still have to tread with cau­tion and en­sure a bud­get that is po­lit­i­cally wa­ter-tight.</p>
    <p>He will also need to weigh up his op­tions on how best to han­dle Umno and in­crease his chances of an­other term in power.</p>
    <p>He can choose to defy Umno or give in to some of its de­mands and loosen Ber­satu’s grip on ad­min­is­tra­tive power.</p>
    <p>The se­cond op­tion might buy his three-year-old party some time to pre­pare for polls and en­hance the like­li­hood of a firm elec­toral pact with its PN al­lies.</p>
