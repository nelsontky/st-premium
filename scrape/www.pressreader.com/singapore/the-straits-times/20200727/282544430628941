    <p>Just a month af­ter Ce­cilia Che­ung (right) was re­ported to have sold her lux­ury prop­erty at a re­duced price, the Hong Kong ac­tress now faces a law­suit by her former agent and his com­pany.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong me­dia re­ported that she was be­ing sued by Mr Yu Yuk Hing and AEG En­ter­tain­ment Group for breach of con­tract.</p>
    <p>In the court fil­ing last Thurs­day, Mr Yu and AEG sought dam­ages from Che­ung, 40, for fail­ing to honour her con­tracts with them.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the court doc­u­ments, Che­ung signed an eightyear exclusive global con­tract with Mr Yu in July 2011. Under this con­tract, he agreed to make an ad­vance pay­ment of HK$40 mil­lion, the re­mu­ner­a­tion for four movies.</p>
    <p>In May 2012, they signed another con­tract for two movies, with him mak­ing a par­tial pay­ment of HK$2.76 mil­lion up­front.</p>
    <p>In July 2014, the ac­tress signed a sup­ple­men­tary con­tract with AEG to up­date the 2011 con­tract.</p>
    <p>Mr Yu said in the court fil­ing Che­ung failed to honour the movie con­tract and he de­manded she re­pay the HK$2.76 mil­lion (S$492,900), in­ter­est, le­gal fees and other in­curred ex­penses.</p>
    <p>AEG also ac­cused her of not hon­our­ing their con­tract and de­manded she re­turn HK$10 mil­lion as dam­ages. It also urged her to dis­close her fi­nances be­tween May 2015 and July last year.</p>
    <p>Che­ung rose to promi­nence in 1999 af­ter act­ing in direc­tor Stephen Chow’s movie King Of Com­edy. She has gone on to act in other ac­claimed movies such as Fly Me To Po­laris (1999), Run­ning On Karma (2003) and Lost In Time (2003), which won her the Best Ac­tress award at the Hong Kong Film Awards in 2004.</p>
    <p>She has not been ac­tive in the movie in­dus­try and con­cen­trated on Chi­nese va­ri­ety shows af­ter her di­vorce from ac­tor Ni­cholas Tse in 2011, with whom she has two sons.</p>
    <p>She ap­peared in the 2012 movie Danger­ous Li­aisons, which also starred South Korean ac­tor Jang Dong-gun and Chi­nese ac­tress Zhang Ziyi; and the 2017 movie Out Of Con­trol.</p>
    <p>Che­ung gave birth to her third son in Novem­ber 2018, but has not dis­closed who the fa­ther is.</p>
