    <p>Wall Street reached a new record high on Tues­day de­spite all the hand-wring­ing about the dev­as­tat­ing blow to the econ­omy from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy stocks led the rally from the trough in March. But more re­cently, other sec­tors, in­clud­ing con­sumer dis­cre­tionary and home builders, had joined in to boost con­fi­dence in the breadth of the re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The S&P 500 gained 0.04 per cent to close at 3,389.78 points on Tues­day, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous record set in Fe­bru­ary. The in­dex is now up 52 per cent from the three-year low in March, mak­ing the re­cov­ery the fastest-ever re­turn to a record high after a drop of at least 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Asian shares tracked US gains to climb to a seven-month peak yes­ter­day. MSCI’s broad­est in­dex of Asia-Pa­cific shares rose 0.48 per cent to close at 172.40 points, a level not seen since late Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The gains were driven by Aus­tralia, up 0.72 per cent, and South Korea, which added 0.52 per cent. Ja­pan’s Nikkei edged up 0.26 per cent, while Hong Kong dropped 0.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Straits Times In­dex dropped 0.08 per cent to end at 2,561.04 points, dragged down by losses in Sin­ga­pore Air­lines.</p>
    <p>The STI is up 14.7 per cent from the March 23 low of 2,233.48.</p>
    <p>In trade-de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore, the US rally boosted op­ti­mism that the mas­sive stim­u­lus rolled out world­wide is work­ing to lift ag­gre­gate de­mand and as­set prices, and is greas­ing the wheels of the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The US has re­placed China this year as Sin­ga­pore’s top ex­port mar­ket. It was the top fixed-as­set for­eign in­vestor last year as well.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­men Lee, head of in­vest­ment re­search at OCBC</p>
    <p>Bank, said: “Strong mo­men­tum for the tech­nol­ogy-led rally has led the US mar­ket higher and this was also sup­ported by the mas­sive amount of fis­cal stim­u­lus glob­ally. In ad­di­tion, the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion in the US seems to show signs of im­prove­ment based on daily case counts.”</p>
    <p>The daily US case count dropped to 34,240 on Aug 11, from a peak of 75,821 on July 17.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter-than-ex­pected eco­nomic data and com­pany earn­ings are also sup­port­ing mar­ket sen­ti­ment. Op­ti­mism in the US is on a surge.</p>
    <p>“After more than a week of teas­ing, the en­dur­ing tech rally fi­nally lifted the S&P 500 into record ter­ri­tory as in­vestors re­main un­de­terred about stock mar­ket con­cen­tra­tions or Covid-19 flash­points around the world,” said Mr Stephen Innes, chief global mar­kets strate­gist at Ax­i­Corp Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In a Bank of Amer­ica sur­vey, in­vestors de­scrib­ing US eq­ui­ties in a bull mar­ket rose to 46 per cent last week, from 40 per cent last month. The share of scep­tics in the sur­vey who said it is a bear mar­ket rally fell from 47 per cent to 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>The big­gest shift in op­ti­mism was to­wards eco­nomic growth, with 79 per cent ex­pect­ing a stronger US econ­omy – the most since De­cem­ber 2009.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity of the sur­vey re­spon­dents ex­pect a Covid-19 vac­cine an­nounce­ment by early in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>The health se­cu­rity has im­proved in Sin­ga­pore as well. Daily cases have dropped sig­nif­i­cantly, while all for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries have been de­clared cleared of the virus.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has pledged about $100 bil­lion in stim­u­lus to save lives and liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>After the worst-ever eco­nomic slump in the se­cond quar­ter, the data flow here has also turned a bit pos­i­tive. While busi­ness sen­ti­ment in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor re­mains sub­dued, a weighted 24 per cent of man­u­fac­tur­ers an­tic­i­pate busi­ness con­di­tions to im­prove in the July to De­cem­ber pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex, a mea­sure of fac­tory ac­tiv­ity, also rose into pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory last month for the first time in six months.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the STI is still down about 20 per cent so far this year. That is be­cause of the large share of weigh­tage in the in­dex for air­line, fi­nan­cial and prop­erty stocks that are likely to suf­fer the most as the econ­omy heads for its worst-ever full-year re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the top five stocks by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion in the S&P 500 are tech gi­ants such as Ap­ple, Ama­zon, Mi­crosoft, Al­pha­bet (Google) and Face­book.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX), the most traded tech­nol­ogy stocks here are up 20 per cent so far this year, with trad­ing turnover 90 per cent higher from last year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s health­care sec­tor, as rep­re­sented by the iEdge SG All Health­care In­dex, has gen­er­ated an 81 per cent to­tal re­turn in the 2020 year to Aug 17, the SGX said.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee said that un­like the US, where growth-driven tech­nol­ogy stocks dom­i­nate, the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket has a higher con­cen­tra­tion of value and cycli­cal shares.</p>
    <p>“As eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties pick up over the com­ing quar­ters, there is likely to be a grad­ual move back into value stocks that are able to re­cover from im­prov­ing eco­nomic con­di­tions. This should help to nar­row the gap be­tween growth and value stocks,” she added.</p>
    <p>In a low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment, in­vestors are also look­ing for yield and stocks here gen­er­ally do of­fer com­par­a­tively higher div­i­dend yields ver­sus their re­gional peers, she added.</p>
