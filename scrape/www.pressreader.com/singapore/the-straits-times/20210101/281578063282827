    <p>The Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel’s rec­om­men­da­tion on Wed­nes­day that all bi­cy­cles must have a func­tion­ing hand­brake to be used on foot­paths and roads was met with sup­port from the cy­cling com­mu­nity, which said it was only right that the po­ten­tial safety haz­ard was out­lawed.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Ma­lik, 37, has been an avid road bike cy­clist for al­most five years now.</p>
    <p>He also does food de­liv­ery on bi­cy­cles and, over the years, has learnt to give a wide berth to fixedgear bi­cy­cles, which of­ten do not have hand-op­er­ated brakes but in­stead rely on the rider’s pedal re­sis­tance to stop.</p>
    <p>He said these bikes, also known col­lo­qui­ally as fix­ies, “take too much time and dis­tance to stop ef­fec­tively”.</p>
    <p>“A few have nearly hit my front wheel when they do skid stops. There are many young­sters who do stunts on the road,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That is quite dan­ger­ous and sud­den move­ments from them can cause panic in other cy­clists, who tend to in­stinc­tively jam on their brakes.”</p>
    <p>The Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel (AMAP) rec­om­men­da­tion on Wed­nes­day that all bi­cy­cles for use on foot­paths and roads must have func­tion­ing hand­brakes was met with sup­port from the cy­cling com­mu­nity, who said it is only right that the po­ten­tial safety haz­ard is out­lawed.</p>
    <p>They said this will al­low fix­ies to be rid­den in a safer way and is a good com­pro­mise. Ban­ning fix­ies out­right would only serve to drive the sub­cul­ture un­der­ground.</p>
    <p>If the rec­om­men­da­tion is ac­cepted, fixie rid­ers will have to af­fix at least a func­tion­ing hand­brake to their bikes when us­ing them on com­mu­nal paths.</p>
    <p>These bikes are fre­quently used to per­form stunts, but came un­der scru­tiny last year when a 13-yearold novice fell to her death af­ter she col­lided with a metal rail­ing in a multi-storey carpark in Pasir Ris in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>AMAP cited the in­ci­dent in its rec­om­men­da­tion and noted that the girl had been un­able to stop the bi­cy­cle in the emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Mr Lufti Oyabun, 34, who has been rid­ing bikes since he was 14, said he has been us­ing fix­ies for six years due to their easy main­te­nance and sim­plic­ity.</p>
    <p>He is a bi­cy­cle courier who plies the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict and finds fix­ies’ easy ma­noeu­vra­bil­ity most suit­able for his job.</p>
    <p>He said fix­ies’ wide­spread use by young peo­ple and these rid­ers’ some­times reck­less be­hav­iour have given the com­mu­nity a bad name.</p>
    <p>He said of the AMAP rec­om­men­da­tion: “It is a good move as the ma­jor­ity of the younger rid­ers are chil­dren and they hop onto this trend with their friends with­out think­ing it through.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the brake­less look of these bikes ap­peals to the min­i­mal­ist aes­thetic that young peo­ple</p>
    <p>PRU­DENT MEA­SURE</p>
    <p>It is a good move as the ma­jor­ity of the younger rid­ers are chil­dren and they hop onto this trend with their friends with­out think­ing it through.</p>
    <p>BI­CY­CLE COURIER LUFTI OYABUN, who has been rid­ing a fixie for six years, on the rec­om­men­da­tion.</p>
    <p>subscribe to, adding that he will in­stall a brake on his own bike to “set a pos­i­tive ex­am­ple” to other younger fixie rid­ers.</p>
    <p>Bike deal­ers The Straits Times spoke to said many fix­ies are of­ten sup­plied with brakes, and it is the rid­ers who dis­man­tle the brakes af­ter they get used to us­ing pedal re­sis­tance to stop their bikes.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for bike dealer Fixie Sin­ga­pore said it will ad­here to the law if the rec­om­men­da­tion is ac­cepted, but noted that other types of bi­cy­cles are also in­volved in ac­ci­dents, so the ab­sence of a hand­brake is not the only pos­si­ble cause.</p>
    <p>He also said some fixie stunts will be­come harder or nearly im­pos­si­ble to per­form if brakes are at­tached. “So this will af­fect the range of their stunts. But I am fully on board with the rec­om­men­da­tion since safety is of course our top­most con­cern,” he said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Dy­namic Bike Shop in Jurong West said it sells be­tween five and 10 fixie bikes each month, usu­ally to young peo­ple who are still in school.</p>
    <p>“It is a small and grow­ing group of bik­ers, so I think the rec­om­men­da­tion is im­por­tant for safety rea­sons,” he said.</p>
