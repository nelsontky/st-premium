    <p>The Tate Bri­tain is shin­ing the spot­light on prints and sculp­tures by the late Sin­ga­pore-born artist Kim Lim in an ex­hi­bi­tion ti­tled Kim Lim: Carv­ing And Print­ing, which runs from this week un­til April. While Lim has been well-re­garded as an artist, she has not pre­vi­ously been fea­tured promi­nently in the pages of art his­tory.</p>
    <p>Two decades af­ter her death, Sin­ga­pore-born sculp­tor and print­maker Kim Lim may fi­nally be get­ting the recog­ni­tion she de­serves.</p>
    <p>Lim, known for her min­i­mal­ist art, has al­ways been well-re­garded as an artist.</p>
    <p>Yet, she has not fea­tured promi­nently in the pages of art his­tory – with her hus­band, the late sculp­tor Wil­liam Turn­bull, of­ten re­ceiv­ing more at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>But the tide may now be turn­ing, with a new dis­play at the pres­ti­gious Tate Bri­tain shin­ing the spot­light on her work.</p>
    <p>Kim Lim: Carv­ing And Print­ing, which runs from this week till April next year, fo­cuses on 20 sculp­tures and works on pa­per from 1958-60 and 1969-74.</p>
    <p>Tate cu­ra­tor Elena Crippa says: “She al­ways said that the prac­tice of sculpt­ing and the prac­tice of print­mak­ing were of equal im­por­tance to her. At times, it was the sculp­ture in­spir­ing print; at times was the other way round.”</p>
    <p>Among the ear­lier works on dis­play are sev­eral lith­o­graphs that are be­ing shown for the first time, as well as sculp­tures such as Sphinx (1959) and Chess Piece (1960), which have a dis­tinc­tively raw qual­ity.</p>
    <p>The later works in­clude etch­ings on pa­per from the Ladder Se­ries, as well as the wooden sculp­tures In­ter­vals I and In­ter­vals II, which have a rhyth­mic dis­con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Crippa says that while she was fa­mil­iar with Lim’s work from the 1970s on­wards, she saw the ear­lier works from 1958 to 1960 only four years ago – and was struck by their raw qual­ity.“There’s some­thing that’s much bolder (about) this early work. You can really see the rigour and play­ful­ness.”</p>
    <p>Lim, a for­eigner liv­ing in Bri­tain, and who never quite be­longed to any move­ment, has been rel­a­tively over­looked in art his­tory, even though her works are sought-af­ter.</p>
    <p>“She was an in­cred­i­bly in­de­pen­dent thinker and maker,” Dr Crippa adds. “I think there’s some­thing a bit un­clas­si­fi­able about her work – she takes in­spi­ra­tion from so many dif­fer­ent ex­am­ples, from Gi­a­cometti to Bran­cusi to Sol LeWitt... to much more an­cient arte­facts from East and West.</p>
    <p>“That said, her work was al­ways well-re­spected. She al­ways had very strong sup­port­ers and en­tered the Tate col­lec­tion rel­a­tively early, in the 1970s. That is really tes­ta­ment to the qual­ity of the work.”</p>
    <p>Lim, daugh­ter of for­mer mag­is­trate Lim Koon Teck, was born in Sin­ga­pore in 1936. She even­tu­ally be­came Bri­tish.</p>
    <p>At the age of 17, she trav­elled to Bri­tain to study art, with the aim of be­com­ing an artist – rare for an Asian woman at that time. She stud­ied at St Martin’s School of Fine Art un­der the famed An­thony Caro, be­fore trans­fer­ring to the Slade School of Fine Art to pur­sue sculpt­ing and print­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>For four decades, she worked within the legacy of min­i­mal­ism and mod­ernism.</p>
    <p>She drew in­spi­ra­tion from her ex­ten­sive trav­els – to places rang­ing from Egypt to Cam­bo­dia – where she would have seen Kh­mer tem­ples, early Chi­nese art and Ja­panese gar­dens.</p>
    <p>Lim died of cancer in 1997, at the age of 61.</p>
    <p>To­day, her art can be found in the col­lec­tions of the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore, Tate Gallery in Lon­don and Liver­pool, Fukuyama City Mu­seum, Arts Coun­cil of Great Bri­tain, and Hong Kong’s M+ mu­seum.</p>
    <p>In the past two years, there have been solo shows of her work at Sotheby’s S|2 Gallery in Lon­don, Manch­ester Art Gallery and STPI – Cre­ative Work­shop & Gallery, which held the first ma­jor solo ex­hi­bi­tion of Lim’s works on pa­per and sculp­tures in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“There’s some­thing that has changed pro­foundly in art his­tory,” says Dr Crippa.</p>
    <p>“What in the past that would maybe have been seen as an art his­tor­i­cal is­sue – you didn’t fit squarely within a de­vel­op­ment – is now seen as a rich­ness.”</p>
    <p>Lim, who did not want to be seen as “other”, felt that what she did was more im­por­tant than where she came from.</p>
    <p>She was in­vited to be part of The Other Story, a 1989 ex­hi­bi­tion at Lon­don’s Hay­ward Gallery fo­cus­ing on African and Asian artists in post-war Bri­tain, but de­clined.</p>
    <p>The artist once re­marked: “Race and gen­der were givens I worked from, per­haps the work does re­flect this which is fine, but I did not want to make them an is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Lim had a stu­dio at home in Cam­den, and could of­ten be seen work­ing in the gar­den.</p>
    <p>“She’d be there with a boil­er­suit, face mask and a head­scarf, tap­ping away,” says Lim’s younger son, mu­si­cian Johnny Turn­bull, 57.</p>
    <p>“When we were younger, we used to spend more time in the stu­dio help­ing her with var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties – ink­ing the etch­ing plates, and turn­ing the wheel (of the print­ing press),” adds Mr Turn­bull, who used to co-opt his mother’s stain­less-steel sculp­ture Echo (1967) – now with the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore – as a make-be­lieve tur­ret.</p>
    <p>Be­ing raised by two ac­claimed artists as par­ents did not feel as un­usual as some peo­ple might ex­pect, he adds.</p>
    <p>“They were very strict... We would have to wash the sculp­tures for money. My dad’s sculp­tures were some of these 1970s steels – enor­mous for a young child. Me and my brother (would be) out there with buck­ets, get­ting the pi­geon drop­pings off them.”</p>
    <p>Mr Turn­bull is thrilled by the resur­gence of in­ter­est i n his mother’s work.</p>
    <p>“It would be very nice if she can in­spire other peo­ple to pur­sue the road less trav­elled.”</p>
    <p>• Kim Lim: Carv­ing And Print­ing runs at Tate Bri­tain, Gallery 34, Mill­bank, West­min­ster, Lon­don, till April 5 next year.</p>
