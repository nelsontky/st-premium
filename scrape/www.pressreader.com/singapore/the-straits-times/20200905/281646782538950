    <p>Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran and Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung sparred with Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai yes­ter­day over re­marks in his maiden speech.</p>
    <p>The Progress Sin­ga­pore Party NCMP had on Tues­day said he was “deeply dis­ap­pointed” that DBS Bank did not have a home-grown chief ex­ec­u­tive. The bank’s cur­rent CEO, Mr Piyush Gupta, was born in In­dia and be­came a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen in 2009.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress yes­ter­day, Mr Iswaran told the House he was trou­bled by Mr Leong’s com­ment.</p>
    <p>“By all means, let us pas­sion­ately ar­gue the case to do more for Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he said in his speech. “But, as par­lia­men­tar­i­ans, let us also be care­ful about what our words con­vey; in this case, the mes­sage we send to those who – to para­phrase Mr S. Ra­jarat­nam – have cho­sen out of con­vic­tion to be­come cit­i­zens of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>ISWARAN: WHAT MES­SAGE IS BE­ING SENT?</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran made the point that build­ing trust with Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­na­tional part­ners is the duty of not only the Gov­ern­ment and pub­lic ser­vice, but also of Par­lia­ment. “What we say, but also what we ac­tively ad­vo­cate in this House, and ul­ti­mately what we do, are all keenly watched,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have painstak­ingly built an open and in­clu­sive econ­omy that is able to cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans by wel­com­ing com­pet­i­tive en­ter­prises and tal­ent. It is a pre­cious as­set that we must not squan­der.”</p>
    <p>Mr Leong replied by say­ing his party is com­mit­ted to an open and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety and econ­omy, but dif­fers with the Gov­ern­ment on is­sues re­lat­ing to for­eign work­ers and jobs. He said his party would like to see “a cap on the for­eign­ers, at least for the im­me­di­ate fu­ture, and to en­sure there is skills trans­fer”.</p>
    <p>Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin then cut Mr Leong off and asked if he was seek­ing a clar­i­fi­ca­tion or mak­ing a new speech.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong said: “I want to ask the min­is­ter whether the de­bate that we are con­duct­ing over the last few days, when we are ques­tion­ing cer­tain is­sues, re­bal­anc­ing cer­tain is­sues that we are look­ing for, is against the spirit that he is try­ing to ex­plain to us just now.”</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing, Mr Iswaran said the process of re­view­ing and evolv­ing Sin­ga­pore’s man­power pol­icy is an “on­go­ing ven­ture”. “It is an evo­lu­tion­ary ef­fort be­cause it has to re­spond to the eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment, the pop­u­la­tion’s needs and con­cerns, and we have to then adapt and move along.”</p>
    <p>The is­sue is not with the process, Mr Iswaran said, but the mes­sage Mr Leong’s speech sends.</p>
    <p>“The is­sue is when we lament that a Sin­ga­porean oc­cu­py­ing a cer­tain po­si­tion is some­how not home­grown, then I think we re­ally have to ask our­selves the ques­tion: As par­lia­men­tar­i­ans, as elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives, what is the mes­sage we are send­ing to our cit­i­zens?”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also asked what mes­sage Mr Leong was send­ing to those who have cho­sen to be­come Sin­ga­pore­ans, their spouses and their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion I would put to Mr Leong is, af­ter this de­bate and all the in­for­ma­tion that has been shared, does he still lament that DBS does not have a home-grown CEO?</p>
    <p>“And does he ac­knowl­edge that... much has been done in the or­gan­i­sa­tion and there is in fact a large num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans at the se­nior lev­els?”</p>
    <p>Mr Leong replied that he would “still hold on to (his) dis­ap­point­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Why didn’t the Gov­ern­ment in the process put in cer­tain safe­guards or cer­tain other rules to en­sure that we have skills trans­fer and... en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans will be groomed to take over the job?”</p>
    <p>He added: “I don’t think it will be taken very neg­a­tively by the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. Sin­ga­pore is open enough.</p>
    <p>“For­eign­ers know that we are very, very open. In fact, if we fail to do cer­tain things to safe­guard the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans, I am afraid we may be laughed at.”</p>
    <p>ONG YE KUNG: DON’T LIMIT SIN­GA­PORE TO BE­ING</p>
    <p>BIG FISH IN A POND</p>
    <p>Mr Ong then rose to re­spond to Mr Leong, re­it­er­at­ing sev­eral points from his own speech on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He noted that he had traced Sin­ga­pore’s jour­ney of build­ing up its fi­nance sec­tor over the last 50 years, start­ing with bring­ing in for­eign ex­per­tise and grow­ing lo­cal tal­ent to to­day’s sit­u­a­tion where “many of our own rose up to take se­nior po­si­tions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said this ap­proach is the best way to serve Sin­ga­pore­ans, and cau­tioned against lim­it­ing Sin­ga­pore to be­ing a “big fish in a pond”.</p>
    <p>“Open up to the la­goon, open up to the sea, have a much more ex­cit­ing, di­verse ecosys­tem, but in­vest in our own peo­ple, hold our own. That is what we have been do­ing for decades.</p>
    <p>“(We) never reached a stage where we say the only way to achieve this is to set a quota, set a rule: it must be a Sin­ga­porean CEO, born here, be­fore we de­clare suc­cess. I think that would be a wrong ap­proach.”</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran re­it­er­ated that Par­lia­ment has to be a voice of rea­son.</p>
    <p>“Don’t take that lightly be­cause what we say can­not be un­said. It is there for the record, for the fu­ture, and ev­ery­one – Sin­ga­pore­ans, new cit­i­zens or Sin­ga­pore­born, oth­ers who are here – will all be look­ing at this.</p>
    <p>“And I think we in this House as elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives must hold our­selves up to a higher stan­dard. If we don’t, then I think we fail our du­ties as Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment, and I think we ul­ti­mately do a dis­ser­vice to Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
