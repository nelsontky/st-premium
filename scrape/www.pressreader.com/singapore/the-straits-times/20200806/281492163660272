    <p>LON­DON • Ful­ham have been a peren­nial yo-yo club, with two pro­mo­tions to and two rel­e­ga­tions from the English Pre­mier League in their last seven cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>But af­ter se­cur­ing a re­turn to the top flight at the first time of ask­ing with a 2-1 ex­tra-time vic­tory over Brent­ford in the Cham­pi­onship play-off fi­nal on Tues­day, man­ager Scott Parker is hope­ful their stay will not be short-lived.</p>
    <p>De­fender Joe Bryan was the un­likely hero for the Cot­tagers, who fin­ished fourth in the English sec­ond-tier stand­ings, be­hind their Wem­b­ley op­po­nents only on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He first caught out Brent­ford goal­keeper David Raya with a deep free kick in the 105th minute, be­fore slot­ting home three min­utes from time.</p>
    <p>De­fender Hen­rik Dals­gaard pulled a goal back for Brent­ford in the fi­nal sec­onds, but there was no time for a come­back by the Bees, who were search­ing for a place in the top flight for the first time since 1947.</p>
    <p>The last time Ful­ham were pro­moted, they blew over £100 mil­lion (S$180 mil­lion) on flops like Cameroo­nian An­dre-Frank Zambo An­guissa and Ivo­rian Jean Michael Seri, only to drop down a di­vi­sion af­ter a dis­mal term.</p>
    <p>From the per­spec­tive of many Ful­ham fans, there was a dis­tinct lack of com­mit­ment from the ma­jor­ity of those big-money ar­rivals and Parker does not want that to be the case this time round.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old con­firmed the club would not be spend­ing wildly again in a bid to strengthen their top-flight sta­tus, even though pro­mo­tion is re­port­edly worth about £170 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“There were some clear er­rors made last time,” the former Ful­ham and Eng­land mid­fielder said. “We will learn from that. We need to learn from that.</p>
    <p>“You can’t build teams with dras­tic changes, dras­tic swings of play­ers com­ing in. We’re go­ing into the best league in the world, the best play­ers, the best teams... it’s a bru­tal league and I re­alise the chal­lenge ahead.”</p>
    <p>Parker, who took over the club in Fe­bru­ary last year af­ter Clau­dio Ranieri was sacked, is con­sid­ered to be part of a bright new gen­er­a­tion of man­agers, in­clud­ing Chelsea’s Frank Lam­pard and Mikel Arteta of Ar­se­nal.</p>
    <p>Pun­dits like Liam Rose­nior, a former Ful­ham player, told Sky Sports he has the mak­ings of a “top-level man­ager”.</p>
    <p>But Parker said that he was sim­ply tak­ing it one step at a time with the west Lon­don club.</p>
    <p>“What we’re try­ing to build and what we’re try­ing to in­grain in these play­ers, in this foot­ball club, is some core foun­da­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, those core foun­da­tions get you far in life. You can have as much tal­ent as you want but, if you’re not build­ing your foot­ball club on con­crete and you’re build­ing it on sand, then in the end, it will be the roller-coaster ride.</p>
    <p>“I hope we can grow grad­u­ally. It’s go­ing to be tough but, if we can’t, we have core foun­da­tions that we al­ways fall back on.”</p>
