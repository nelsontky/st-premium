    <p>Of­fice rents in Sin­ga­pore saw their steep­est de­cline in 11 years in the third quar­ter, of­fi­cial data showed yes­ter­day, as the Covid-19 pan­demic hit leas­ing de­mand for com­mer­cial real es­tate in the re­gional busi­ness hub.</p>
    <p>Rents for of­fice space fell 4.5 per cent on a quar­terly ba­sis in July-Sep­tem­ber, data from the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity showed. That was the big­gest quar­terly de­cline since the April-June pe­riod in 2009, when rents fell by 7.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The city-state, which is fac­ing its deep­est re­ces­sion ever due to the pan­demic, had im­ple­mented lockdown mea­sures ear­lier this year and has been en­cour­ag­ing of­fice work­ers to work from home, although some rules are eas­ing as coro­n­avirus cases fall.</p>
    <p>“The of­fice mar­ket could con­tinue to face sig­nif­i­cant head­winds go­ing into the next few quar­ters,” said Ms Chris­tine Li at real es­tate con­sul­tant Cush­man & Wake­field. How­ever, the of­fice leas­ing mar­ket will ben­e­fit from the ex­pan­sion plans of com­pa­nies such as TikTok owner ByteDance and gam­ing gi­ant Ten­cent Hold­ings, she added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s data also showed that prices of of­fice space in the cen­tral re­gion went up 0.2 per cent in the third quar­ter af­ter de­clin­ing 4.3 per cent in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Is­land­wide, there was a to­tal sup­ply of about 767,000 sq m of gross floor area (GFA) of of­fice space in the pipe­line at the end of the quar­ter, against 668,000 sq m GFA at the end of the pre­vi­ous quar­ter. The amount of oc­cu­pied of­fice space fell by 19,000 sq m of net let­table area in the third quar­ter, ver­sus a big­ger drop of 55,000 sq m in three months be­fore that.</p>
    <p>Rents of re­tail space in Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral re­gion dropped 4.5 per cent in the third quar­ter, af­ter de­clin­ing 3.5 per cent in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>But prices of re­tail space in the cen­tral re­gion rose 2.2 per cent in the third quar­ter this year, af­ter a 1.5 per cent drop in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Is­land­wide, there was a to­tal sup­ply of 428,000 sq m GFA of re­tail space from projects in the pipe­line, up from 364,000 sq m in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>What prices of re­tail space in the cen­tral re­gion fell by in the third quar­ter, af­ter slid­ing 3.5 per cent in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
