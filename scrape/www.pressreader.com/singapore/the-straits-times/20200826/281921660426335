    <p>BANGKOK • A Thai court yes­ter­day is­sued a new ar­rest war­rant for the heir to the Red Bull en­ergy drink for­tune over his al­leged in­volve­ment in a fa­tal hit-and-run ac­ci­dent in 2012, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Vo­rayuth Yoovid­hya was ac­cused of crash­ing his Fer­rari into a po­lice­man, of­fi­cer Wichien Klan­prasert, and drag­ging his body for dozens of me­tres be­fore flee­ing.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties last month un­ex­pect­edly dropped the case, spark­ing public crit­i­cism that prompted a gov­ern­ment review. The crim­i­nal court in Bangkok yes­ter­day ap­proved a new ar­rest war­rant for Vo­rayuth on a pre­vi­ous charge of reck­less driv­ing caus­ing death and a new charge of drug use, as­sis­tant na­tional po­lice chief Jaruwat Waisaya told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Vo­rayuth missed eight court sum­monses be­fore the au­thor­i­ties is­sued an ar­rest war­rant five years af­ter the in­ci­dent. He later dis­ap­peared, ap­par­ently abroad, ac­cord­ing to so­cial me­dia posts. Vo­rayuth’s lawyer, Mr Sa­mack Chou­va­parnante, told Reuters he had no knowl­edge of the new war­rant and had not been in touch with his client.</p>
    <p>TCP Group, which owns the Thai Red Bull brand, has pre­vi­ously said it has no di­rect links with Vo­rayuth.</p>
    <p>His late grand­fa­ther, Mr Cha­leo</p>
    <p>Yoovid­hya, cre­ated the en­ergy drink and his fa­ther has part own­er­ship of the Red Bull brand.</p>
    <p>A panel this month re­vis­ited ev­i­dence pre­vi­ously not in­cluded in po­lice re­ports sug­gest­ing Vo­rayuth’s car was trav­el­ling faster than pre­vi­ously thought, and re­viewed a blood test taken af­ter the ac­ci­dent that pointed to traces of co­caine in his sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“We will sub­mit a new re­port within two weeks so the public prose­cu­tor can is­sue a pros­e­cu­tion or­der,” Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral Jaruwat said.</p>
    <p>For Thais laid low by the coronaviru­s pan­demic and fac­ing dim job prospects, Vo­rayuth’s case has be­come a stun­ning sym­bol of in­equal­ity. Public fury forced the po­lice and the of­fice of the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral to set up pan­els to ex­am­ine their own con­duct.</p>
