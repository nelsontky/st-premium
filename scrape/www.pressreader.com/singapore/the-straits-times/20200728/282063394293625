    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat has un­veiled more de­tails of his East Coast Plan, and urged res­i­dents in the GRC to step for­ward and work with their MPs to get it off the ground.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, he set out the role of each MP in the five-mem­ber group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency.</p>
    <p>East Coast GRC, with its di­verse res­i­dents and neigh­bour­hoods, has a wide and var­ied “range of needs, as­pi­ra­tions and ex­per­tise, as well as many new pos­si­bil­i­ties!” wrote Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies as well as Finance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“Let’s har­ness this di­ver­sity and turn this into a strength. So let’s con­tinue to dis­cuss how we can im­prove the de­sign of our East Coast Plan, and to put them into ac­tion to­gether with our res­i­dents.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that new MP Tan Kiat How, who has been ap­pointed Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice as well as the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, is “in a good po­si­tion to cham­pion is­sues re­lated to in­fra­struc­ture and sus­tain­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, the former chief ex­ec­u­tive of the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, will also en­sure the East Coast Plan will be part of the broader na­tional ef­fort in the next phase of Sin­ga­pore’s de­vel­op­ment, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“Kiat How has a pas­sion in this area... (he) has much to con­trib­ute, by imag­in­ing how we can in­te­grate the phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal devel­op­ments in East Coast, and in Sin­ga­pore,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Jes­sica Tan will con­tinue to chair the East Coast Town Coun­cil. She will also over­see ef­forts to help busi­nesses in the GRC – es­pe­cially small and medium-sized en­ter­prises – trans­form and stay rel­e­vant. She is group com­mer­cial direc­tor at Raf­fles Med­i­cal Group.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Ch­eryl Chan, who works at in­dus­trial gases and en­gi­neer­ing group Linde as its head of clean hy­dro­gen, will over­see the con­stituency’s ef­forts to reach out to se­niors.</p>
    <p>Both women have worked hard in im­prov­ing the phys­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment of es­tates in East Coast and bring­ing so­cial pro­grammes to the com­mu­nity, the DPM said.</p>
    <p>“These pro­grammes will be ex­panded as we seek vol­un­teers to join us in building a co­he­sive and car­ing East Coast,” he added. “And with their ex­ten­sive pri­vate-sec­tor ex­pe­ri­ences and ex­per­tise, they can bring in fresh an­gles to the way we de­sign and im­ple­ment our plans to serve our res­i­dents.”</p>
    <p>The fifth mem­ber of the East Coast team, Dr Ma­liki Os­man, has been pro­moted to Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice in the Cabi­net reshuf­fle. He has also been ap­pointed Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and Foreign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said Dr Ma­liki will work on help­ing Sin­ga­porean chil­dren get a holis­tic ed­u­ca­tion, and fur­ther develop the Up­lift Pro­gramme for chil­dren from dis­ad­van­taged homes. In Foreign Af­fairs, his un­der­stand­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s pri­or­i­ties and af­fa­ble per­son­al­ity will help him build rap­port with peo­ple around the world, es­pe­cially in this re­gion, the DPM said.</p>
    <p>“This is in ad­di­tion to his many other du­ties, in­clud­ing those in East Coast,” he added. “This means much more work, but Ma­liki tells me he’s all set to do more.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng him­self will fo­cus on help­ing work­ers re­tain their jobs, se­cure new ones and develop new skills.</p>
