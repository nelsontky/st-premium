    <p>Had it not been for ma­jor moves like cut­ting jobs, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) would not be around to­day, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day, as he un­packed how Covid-19 has caused a “deep cri­sis” for the na­tional car­rier and Changi Air­port Group (CAG).</p>
    <p>Global travel re­stric­tions aris­ing from the pan­demic have dec­i­mated Changi Air­port’s business, and while SIA has worked to stave off the worst of the cri­sis, the coast is far from clear, Mr Ong said in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>SIA has raised about $11 bil­lion in liq­uid­ity since the start of the 2020/2021 fi­nan­cial year in April through av­enues like a rights is­sue backed by Te­masek, long-term loans se­cured on some of its planes, as well as com­mit­ted lines of credit and a short-term un­se­cured loan from fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that SIA had recorded its largest quar­terly loss on record in the first quar­ter of fis­cal year 2020, Mr Ong said that it is try­ing its best to re­duce cash burn, pre­serve its core ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ex­plore all ways to gen­er­ate rev­enue.</p>
    <p>He also pointed out that while SIA had made the tough de­ci­sion to cut jobs, a re­cently con­cluded agree­ment with its pi­lot union for pi­lots to take deeper salary cuts meant it man­aged to re­duce the num­ber of re­trench­ments from 2,400 to 2,000. “With­out the re­cent ma­jor cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion ex­er­cise, there would not be an SIA to­day, but it is far from be­ing out of the woods,” said Mr Ong in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on avi­a­tion re­cov­ery here.</p>
    <p>He re­vealed that Changi Air­port is now serv­ing just 1.5 per cent of its</p>
    <p>usual pas­sen­ger vol­ume and 17 per cent of the pre-Covid-19 num­ber of flights. It has also plum­meted to be the 58th busiest air­port for pas­sen­ger traf­fic, down from sev­enth place.</p>
    <p>This dras­tic drop in rank­ing is due to Sin­ga­pore’s small size and its re­liance on in­ter­na­tional traf­fic, ex­plained Mr Ong in re­sponse to Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC), who had asked why Changi is worse off com­pared with other air­ports.</p>
    <p>Large na­tions like China and the United States have big­ger pop­u­la­tions who are not just fly­ing within the coun­try but also gen­er­at­ing in­ter­na­tional traf­fic, he added.</p>
    <p>CAG, too, has lost rev­enue streams, said Mr Ong. Shops and restau­rants in the air­port are see­ing fewer cus­tomers, and many of them have closed. This has caused CAG to dip into its re­serves to pre­serve cash to stay alive.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing Ter­mi­nal 5, a largescale project be­ing un­der­taken by the group, will be paused for two years so that ef­forts can be fo­cused on the pace of air travel re­cov­ery, said Mr Ong in re­sponse to Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Pan­jang), who had asked about the is­sue.</p>
    <p>He added that no ef­fort will be spared to sup­port SIA, CAG and other com­pa­nies in the avi­a­tion sec­tor, and pointed out that the sec­tor ben­e­fits from the high­est tier of sup­port from the Gov­ern­ment’s Jobs Sup­port Scheme to co-pay salaries.</p>
    <p>Other av­enues of help for firms in the in­dus­try in­clude cost re­lief through the En­hanced Avi­a­tion Sup­port Pack­age, and tem­po­rary re­de­ploy­ment pro­grammes for work­ers af­fected.</p>
    <p>Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC) sug­gested Sin­ga­pore ramp up its lo­gis­tics and cargo move­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties, as Mr Ong had said that Changi Air­port is serv­ing 21/ times more cargo flights now com­pared with pre-pan­demic times.</p>
    <p>These ca­pa­bil­i­ties will be bol­stered when de­mand for them in­creases, said the min­is­ter, but he warned that cargo flights are only 7 per cent of to­tal flights and avi­a­tion can­not be re­stored by bank­ing on cargo flights alone.</p>
    <p>FLIGHTS TO NOWHERE</p>
    <p>Mr Ong also touched on one of the sug­ges­tions by SIA to gen­er­ate rev­enue and get pi­lots to fly by con­duct­ing flights to nowhere, where pas­sen­gers pay to go on scenic voy­ages that would take off and land in the same air­port.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that some MPs like Mr Den­nis Tan (Hougang) and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) had asked if the Gov­ern­ment would sup­port this, Mr Ong said that this has be­come a moot point, as SIA said late last month that it would be scrap­ping this idea.</p>
    <p>But he added the Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) would al­ways try its best to sup­port SIA in times of cri­sis, tak­ing is­sue with Prof Lim’s sug­ges­tion to im­pose an en­vi­ron­ment tax on the car­rier had the flights taken off. “What I will not con­tem­plate is to im­pose on them an en­vi­ron­ment tax at this time, as As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim in­di­cated in his ques­tion, be­cause that will just worsen the cri­sis for SIA,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim later asked dur­ing ques­tion time why such a tax could not be con­sid­ered fur­ther, as SIA could pass on the cost of such a tax to con­sumers – to which Mr Ong replied that Sin­ga­pore was in a cri­sis and SIA needs as much help to pre­serve its cash as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing this with the Chi­nese proverb luo jing xia shi, which means to throw a stone at some­one who has fallen into a well and refers to mak­ing a bad sit­u­a­tion worse, Mr Ong cau­tioned against ex­ac­er­bat­ing things for SIA. He added that fur­ther con­ver­sa­tions about an en­vi­ron­men­tal tax can carry on later when the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion im­proves.</p>
