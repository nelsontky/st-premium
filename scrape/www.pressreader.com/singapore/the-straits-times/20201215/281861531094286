    <p>In­done­sian vig­i­lante group Is­lamic De­fend­ers’ Front (FPI) has re­cruited for­mer mem­bers of the dis­banded Mus­lim hard­line group Hizbut Tahrir In­done­sia (HTI) and con­ducted army-like train­ing for young re­cruits.</p>
    <p>The rev­e­la­tion came as the po­lice yesterday re­leased more de­tails of what hap­pened dur­ing a shoot-out be­tween of­fi­cers and the body­guards of FPI leader Rizieq Shi­hab last week.</p>
    <p>“They re­cruited the die-hard types from Garut, Suk­abumi, Bo­gor to train in Mega­men­dung to be­come Laskar (para­mil­i­tary troops),” ac­cord­ing to a se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>“This is high mil­i­tancy and calls for a prompt ac­tion,” the of­fi­cial added.</p>
    <p>FPI runs an Is­lamic board­ing school in Mega­men­dung, West Java prov­ince, in the fa­mous Pun­cak area about 1½ hours’ drive from the cap­i­tal Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Garut, Suk­abumi and Bo­gor – also in West Java – are some of the stronghold­s of rad­i­cal­ism in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>HTI, which called for Is­lamic law and wanted to unify all Mus­lims into a caliphate, was dis­banded in mid-2017 on grounds that it con­tra­dicted In­done­sia’s state ide­ol­ogy Pan­casila, the found­ing na­tional prin­ci­ples that pro­mote plu­ral­ism, tol­er­ance and democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Rizieq, the FPI leader, was de­clared a sus­pect and de­tained last Satur­day in re­la­tion to a Nov 14 mass event which flouted health mea­sures to con­trol the spread of the coro­n­avirus and sparked fears of fresh out­breaks in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of Rizieq’s sup­port­ers had gath­ered to at­tend the wed­ding of his daugh­ter and to com­mem­o­rate Prophet Muham­mad’s birthday. The cleric had ig­nored po­lice sum­monses for ques­tion­ing and was placed un­der sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>Po­lice tailed his con­voy in the early hours of Dec 7, lead­ing to a shoot-out with his body­guards. Six body­guards were killed, while four oth­ers fled the scene.</p>
    <p>FPI said the po­lice shoot­ings were “ex­tra­ju­di­cial killings” and claimed the body­guards did not have firearms.</p>
    <p>The po­lice, how­ever, said yesterday that the of­fi­cers had acted in self-de­fence.</p>
    <p>Two of the body­guards killed had tried to shoot the of­fi­cers af­ter ram­ming their car. The other four were gunned down on their way to the po­lice sta­tion af­ter they tried to snatch the of­fi­cers’ firearms.</p>
    <p>Anti-ter­ror ex­pert Adhe Bhakti of the Cen­tre for Rad­i­cal­ism and Derad­i­cal­i­sa­tion Stud­ies pointed out that mem­bers of FPI, HTI as well as other Is­lamist groups had held a joint mass street rally in 2016 to protest against then Jakarta Gover­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja</p>
    <p>Pur­nama. The eth­nic Chi­nese gover­nor, a Chris­tian, was – in a con­tro­ver­sial court rul­ing – con­victed of blas­phemy against Is­lam.</p>
    <p>“Ex-HTI mem­bers need a new home, at least one that is sim­i­lar, although ide­ol­ogy-wise FPI and HTI are not a match,” Mr Adhe told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“It is also not im­pos­si­ble that those ex-HTI mem­bers join­ing FPI have on their mind that at some point, they could in­flu­ence FPI to change.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Rizieq’s de­ten­tion, in­ci­dents were re­ported across sev­eral cities on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>A 30-year-old sup­porter iden­ti­fied as Muham­mad Fir­man­syah tossed Molo­tov cock­tails out­side a bank branch in West Jakarta and was ar­rested, ac­cord­ing to po­lice. No ca­su­al­ties were re­ported.</p>
    <p>In Makas­sar, South Su­lawesi, a group of peo­ple threw a Molo­tov cock­tail at a po­lice post, smash­ing its win­dow.</p>
    <p>In an­other in­ci­dent, res­i­dents de­scended on Ci­amis po­lice sta­tion in West Java to stage a rally and told of­fi­cers to put them in jail as a show of sol­i­dar­ity for Rizieq.</p>
