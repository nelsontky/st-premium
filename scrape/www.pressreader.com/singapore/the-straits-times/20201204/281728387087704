    <p>The charge (against Jimmy Lai and the two Next Me­dia se­nior ex­ec­u­tives) states they were not us­ing the of­fice space as per­mit­ted un­der the lease be­tween 2016 and 2020, and had sub-let part of the premises, re­sult­ing in ben­e­fits to Ap­ple Daily.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong me­dia ty­coon and pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Jimmy Lai was de­nied bail yes­ter­day on a fraud charge re­lated to the lease of a build­ing that houses his news­pa­per Ap­ple Daily.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties have in­ten­si­fied a crack­down on key op­po­si­tion fig­ures in the Chi­ne­seruled city since Bei­jing im­posed sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion on the global fi­nan­cial cen­tre on June 30.</p>
    <p>While Lai’s fraud charge did not fall un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law, it marks the lat­est crack­down on pro-democ­racy fig­ures in the former Bri­tish colony, which was handed back to China in 1997, with Bei­jing promis­ing to keep its free­wheel­ing way of life for 50 years.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say the na­tional se­cu­rity law crushes free­doms en­shrined un­der the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” for­mula, while sup­port­ers say it will bring sta­bil­ity af­ter pro­longed anti-gov­ern­ment, prodemoc­racy protests last year.</p>
    <p>Lai, 73, an ar­dent critic of Bei­jing, had been de­tained on Wed­nes­day. He was or­dered to re­main in cus­tody yes­ter­day, pend­ing fur­ther pro­ceed­ings. Two se­nior ex­ec­u­tives of Lai’s Next Me­dia group, who were charged along­side him, were re­leased on bail, said Mr Mark Simon, an as­so­ci­ate of Lai.</p>
    <p>Judge Vic­tor So of the West Kowloon Mag­is­trates’ Courts ad­journed the case un­til April 16, the tabloid-style Ap­ple Daily re­ported.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Joshua Wong, 24, one of Hong Kong’s most prom­i­nent democ­racy ac­tivists, was jailed for 13½ months for his role in an anti-gov­ern­ment rally last year, the tough­est sen­tenc­ing of an op­po­si­tion fig­ure this year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, former Demo­cratic Party leg­is­la­tor Ted Hui an­nounced that he will go into ex­ile, and will not be re­turn­ing to Hong</p>
    <p>Kong, pub­lic broad­caster Ra­dio Tele­vi­sion Hong Kong re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Hui, who is fac­ing a num­ber of protest-re­lated pros­e­cu­tions, had left Hong Kong for Den­mark on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Lai and the two se­nior ex­ec­u­tives are said to have falsely rep­re­sented the use of their of­fice space to their land­lord, a pub­lic cor­po­ra­tion set up by the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The charge states that they were not us­ing the of­fice space as per­mit­ted un­der the lease be­tween 2016 and 2020, and had sub-let part of the premises, re­sult­ing in ben­e­fits to Ap­ple Daily.</p>
    <p>Next Dig­i­tal, which sus­pended trad­ing yes­ter­day morn­ing, said in a state­ment that it did not ex­pect the charges to have an im­me­di­ate im­pact on its daily op­er­a­tions, as the com­pany is op­er­ated by a team of man­age­ment per­son­nel. Its shares will re­sume trad­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>“This is about dirty­ing Jimmy up. It’s Bei­jing’s polic­ing brought to Hong Kong,” Mr Simon told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Lai was ar­rested in Au­gust when about 200 po­lice of­fi­cers swooped on his of­fices. Hong Kong po­lice later said they had ar­rested nine men and one woman for sus­pected of­fences in­clud­ing “col­lu­sion with a for­eign coun­try/ex­ter­nal el­e­ments to en­dan­ger na­tional se­cu­rity, con­spir­acy to de­fraud” and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Sus­pi­cion of col­lud­ing with for­eign forces car­ries a max­i­mum sen­tence of life in jail un­der the new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Lai has been a fre­quent vis­i­tor to Wash­ing­ton, where he has met of­fi­cials in­clud­ing US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, to rally sup­port for Hong Kong democ­racy, prompt­ing Bei­jing to la­bel him a “traitor”.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity law pun­ishes any­thing China con­sid­ers sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, ter­ror­ism or col­lu­sion with for­eign forces with up to life in prison.</p>
