    <p>• France and Ger­many are lead­ing ef­forts in Europe to make early con­tact with Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s team, with the aim of ac­cel­er­at­ing talks to nor­malise trade re­la­tions be­tween the United States and the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>At the top of the agenda for Paris is re­solv­ing an air­craft dis­pute that has seen tar­iffs im­posed on more than €10 bil­lion (S$16 bil­lion) of transat­lantic goods, while Ber­lin is keen to re­vive free trade talks, said se­nior of­fi­cials in both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We are ready and in a po­si­tion to hold talks im­me­di­ately,” said Mr Jo­hann Wade­phul, a for­eign pol­icy ex­pert and deputy cau­cus leader in Par­lia­ment for Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel’s Chris­tian Democrats.</p>
    <p>French Fi­nance Min­is­ter Bruno Le Maire, who had planned to speak with the Pres­i­dent-elect’s team ear­lier this week, said: “I re­ally hope that this new Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will mean a new start in the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Europe and the US.”</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional EU trade pri­or­i­ties, which are shared by France and Ger­many, in­clude re­mov­ing tar­iffs the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion put on Euro­pean steel and alu­minium ex­ports, agree­ing on new tax rules for dig­i­tal com­pa­nies that do business in­ter­na­tion­ally, reach­ing a limited trade agree­ment on in­dus­trial prod­ucts, and re­form­ing the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean over­tures come after weeks of un­cer­tainty over the US tran­si­tion that had many allies in a wait-and-see mode.</p>
    <p>Mr Le Maire was sched­uled to speak with Mr Bi­den’s team on Mon­day, but the meet­ing was post­poned. Ger­man of­fi­cials ex­pect to make con­tact in the com­ing days, said Mr Wade­phul.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, which re­lies heav­ily on ex­port mar­kets and does US$252 bil­lion (S$337 bil­lion) in bi­lat­eral trade with the US each year, is par­tic­u­larly ea­ger to de-es­ca­late ten­sions with the US, which has im­posed tar­iffs on Euro­pean ex­ports in the name of shoring up Amer­i­can in­dus­tries. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has threat­ened mul­ti­ple times to hit the Ger­man auto sec­tor with levies.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure is mount­ing in Ber­lin for the gov­ern­ment to reach out to the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion on free trade talks, par­tic­u­larly after China sealed an­other largescale trade deal in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>While many politi­cians in Europe ex­pect Mr Bi­den will make sim­i­lar de­mands on them as Mr Trump did in terms of step­ping up se­cu­rity and de­fence ef­forts, the prospect of hav­ing more open ears in Washington is driv­ing ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>France is push­ing for an over­haul of global tax rules to make multi­na­tional tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies pay their fair share, but the talks at the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment (OECD) have dragged on.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US is threat­en­ing tar­iffs against coun­tries, in­clud­ing France, that go ahead with taxes on the rev­enues of dig­i­tal firms.</p>
    <p>“I will have a dis­cus­sion about the best way of re­duc­ing in­equal­i­ties in our eco­nomic mod­els and, of course, I will put on the ta­ble the ques­tion of trade and the ques­tion of dig­i­tal tax­a­tion,” Mr Le Maire said, re­fer­ring to talks with the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Our goal re­mains to have an OECD agree­ment by the first months of 2021.”</p>
