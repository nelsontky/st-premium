    <p>PARIS • Sci­en­tists have iden­ti­fied a new species of pri­mate liv­ing in the forests of cen­tral Myan­mar, a lithe tree-dweller with a mask-like face framed by a shock of un­ruly grey hair.</p>
    <p>The Popa lan­gur – named af­ter an ex­tinct vol­cano home to its largest pop­u­la­tion, some 100 in­di­vid­u­als – has been around for at least a mil­lion years, ac­cord­ing to a study de­tail­ing the find, pub­lished yes­ter­day in Zo­o­log­i­cal Re­search.</p>
    <p>But with only 200 to 250 left in the wild, ex­perts will rec­om­mend that the leaf-eat­ing species be clas­si­fied as “crit­i­cally en­dan­gered”.</p>
    <p>“Just de­scribed, the Popa lan­gur is al­ready fac­ing ex­tinc­tion,” said se­nior author Frank Momberg, a re­searcher at Fauna and Flora In­ter­na­tional, in Yan­gon.</p>
    <p>Through­out its range, the monkey with star­tling chalk-white rings around its eyes is threat­ened by “hunt­ing, habi­tat loss, degra­da­tion, frag­men­ta­tion caused by agri­cul­tural en­croach­ment, and il­le­gal or un­sus­tain­able tim­ber ex­trac­tion”, the study found.</p>
    <p>The first ev­i­dence of the new species did not come from the wild, but the back­rooms of the Lon­don Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum, where ge­netic anal­y­sis re­vealed that spec­i­mens gath­ered more than a cen­tury ago, when Burma was a Bri­tish colony, were some­thing new.</p>
    <p>Sam­ples of Popa poop col­lected by Mr Momberg and his col­leagues in the for­est matched those from the mu­seum and showed that the pre­vi­ously un­known lan­gur was still roaming the wild.</p>
    <p>The reclu­sive mon­keys were fi­nally cap­tured on film in 2018, re­veal­ing their dis­tinc­tive fur coloura­tion and mark­ings.</p>
    <p>Trachyp­ithe­cus popa, or T. popa for short, has a grey-brown­ish and white belly, with black hands and wrists that look a bit like gloves.</p>
    <p>Its ag­ile tail – at nearly a me­tre long – is longer than its body, with the crea­ture weigh­ing about 8kg.</p>
    <p>“Ad­di­tional field sur­veys and pro­tec­tion mea­sures are ur­gently re­quired and will be con­ducted by Fauna and Flora In­ter­na­tional and oth­ers to save the lan­gurs from ex­tinc­tion,” said Mr Ngwe Lwin, a pri­ma­tol­o­gist with the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Myan­mar pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists at the Ger­man Pri­mate Cen­tre in Goet­tin­gen, Ger­many, co-led the re­search.</p>
    <p>There are more than 20 species of lan­gur in the world, sev­eral of them crit­i­cally en­dan­gered.</p>
    <p>The best known among them is</p>
    <p>the grey or Hanu­man lan­gur, named af­ter the wan­der­ing monkey god prom­i­nent i n the Hindu epic Ra­mayana.</p>
    <p>In the new study, an in­terna</p>
    <p>tional team of more than 30 re­searchers also de­coded the evo­lu­tion­ary his­tory of the broader group, or genus, that in­cluded lan­gurs by se­quenc­ing the mi­to­chon</p>
    <p>drial genomes of 41 spec­i­mens.</p>
    <p>There are more than 20 crit­i­cally en­dan­gered species of pri­mate in the world to­day.</p>
