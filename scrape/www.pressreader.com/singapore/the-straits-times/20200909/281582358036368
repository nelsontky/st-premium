    <p>All planes fly­ing in and out of Sin­ga­pore are now re­quired to set up an emer­gency quar­an­tine area as part of mea­sures to min­imise pas­sen­gers’ risk of ex­po­sure to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>All planes fly­ing in and out of Sin­ga­pore are now re­quired to set up an on-board emer­gency quar­an­tine area by block­ing off a sec­tion of seats, as part of mea­sures to min­imise pas­sen­gers’ risk of ex­po­sure to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) told The Straits Times that pas­sen­gers or crew who be­come un­well with fever or any Covid-19 symp­toms dur­ing a flight must be moved to the quar­an­tine area and be iso­lated from oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The lava­tory clos­est to the quar­an­tine area must also be re­served for those who are un­well.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has set aside the last three rows on the left side of its planes. Any SIA crew mem­ber serv­ing the ill per­son on board will also have to wear full per­sonal pro­tec­tive gear.</p>
    <p>Bud­get car­rier Jet­star Asia has also set aside the last three rows on ei­ther the left or right side.</p>
    <p>The re­quire­ment be­came known this month when Jet­star Asia said it had set up on-board iso­la­tion zones, among other mea­sures, to guard against the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Foo, act­ing se­nior di­rec­tor of the safety reg­u­la­tion group at CAAS, said the author­ity had man­dated the quar­an­tine area in May.</p>
    <p>“To min­imise the risk of ex­po­sure to Covid-19 dur­ing their jour­neys, safe travel mea­sures have been put in place for all flights op­er­at­ing into and out of Sin­ga­pore,” he added.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures de­vel­oped in con­sul­ta­tion with the Min­istry of Health in­clude re­quir­ing pas­sen­gers to wear masks through­out flights and hav­ing those fly­ing to Sin­ga­pore take a ba­sic health as­sess­ment be­fore board­ing the plane.</p>
    <p>Meal ser­vices on board have been mod­i­fied to re­duce con­tact be­tween crew and pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>On whether CAAS would make the quar­an­tine zones a per­ma­nent mea­sure, Mr Foo said it will re­view them when nec­es­sary, given the evolv­ing na­ture of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Leong Hoe Nam said CAAS’ de­ci­sion to re­quire the zones is a sen­si­ble one that will ef­fec­tively limit the ex­po­sure of an un­well pas­sen­ger to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>He said re­serv­ing an on-board toi­let for use by an un­well pas­sen­ger will also re­move an­other po­ten­tial mode of virus trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“While the high-ef­fi­ciency par­tic­u­late air fil­ters on planes work in re­fresh­ing the air inside the cabin, there is still a risk of trans­mis­sion to pas­sen­gers sit­ting within three rows in front or be­hind an in­fected pas­sen­ger,” added Dr Leong.</p>
    <p>“If you stay out­side the zone, you re­move the risk.”</p>
    <p>The manda­tory quar­an­tine zone goes a step be­yond in­ter­na­tional guide­lines on iso­lat­ing an un­well per­son while in flight.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata), if a pas­sen­ger or crew mem­ber be­comes un­well on board, an air­line should try to re­lo­cate ad­ja­cent pas­sen­gers such that there is a space of 2m be­tween them and the un­well per­son.</p>
    <p>Should there be no seats avail­able, Iata rec­om­mends that the air­line give per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment to ad­ja­cent pas­sen­gers. It also rec­om­mends sev­eral other pre­cau­tions, such as stor­ing soiled items from the un­well per­son in a bio­haz­ard bag.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie from So­bie Avi­a­tion said coun­tries need to work to­gether to stan­dard­ise safety re­quire­ments to help the avi­a­tion sec­tor re­cover. For ex­am­ple, the lack of uni­form reg­u­la­tions within Asean is ham­per­ing ef­forts to restart travel within the re­gion, he said.</p>
    <p>“The is­sue is that ev­ery coun­try has dif­fer­ent re­quire­ments... It is dis­ap­point­ing that af­ter so many months, we still do not have con­ver­gence for this re­quire­ment and many oth­ers,” added Mr So­bie.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant as the in­dus­try is try­ing to re­boot in­ter­na­tional travel, but when you have dif­fer­ent reg­u­la­tions i n ev­ery coun­try, it makes it so dif­fi­cult for air­lines.”</p>
    <p>Separately, CAAS said yes­ter­day that the first 14 visi­tors from New Zealand and Brunei touched down in Changi Air­port yes­ter­day fol­low­ing Sin­ga­pore’s uni­lat­eral re­open­ing of its bor­ders to the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Five were from Brunei, and the rest were from New Zealand.</p>
    <p>CAAS added that it has ap­proved 59 trav­ellers from Brunei and 77 from New Zealand to fly to Sin­ga­pore as at 5pm yes­ter­day. Ap­pli­ca­tions opened on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Th­ese visi­tors will come un­der the Air Travel Pass Scheme, which al­lows for all forms of short-term travel, in­clud­ing leisure travel. This is in con­trast to re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments be­tween coun­tries, which are usu­ally for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel.</p>
    <p>Th­ese visi­tors will be tested for Covid-19 upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and will be able to go about the coun­try if they test neg­a­tive.</p>
