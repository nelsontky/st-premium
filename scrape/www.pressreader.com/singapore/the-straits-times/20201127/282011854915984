    <p>How do you de­fine suc­cess? For some par­ents, it might be be­ing able to brag about a child who just scored the best pos­si­ble score in his Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE).</p>
    <p>The re­cent re­lease of PSLE re­sults and the change in the scor­ing sys­tem led me, a tu­tor for eight years, to re­flect on the mean­ing of na­tion­wide ex­ams.</p>
    <p>Par­ents should place less em­pha­sis on aca­demic pur­suits, and in­stead spend time with their chil­dren to nur­ture them as well-rounded in­di­vid­u­als. I un­der­stand that some­times, this is more of an af­ter­thought as it’s easy to be caught up in the rat race in a highly com­pet­i­tive coun­try.</p>
    <p>As a tu­tor, I wit­ness first-hand the detri­men­tal ef­fects on chil­dren who are pres­sured to do well aca­dem­i­cally. Some of my stu­dents lamented about how much they hate their par­ents for mak­ing them study. Oth­ers ne­glected their sleep and health. I have even had a stu­dent who told me of his plan to com­mit sui­cide (thank­fully he de­cided not to af­ter my pep talk).</p>
    <p>It can seem like an irony at times, as I’m a tu­tor who ad­vo­cates for chil­dren not hav­ing tu­ition un­less nec­es­sary. I’ve even had to ad­vise a par­ent that her child did not need more lessons from me.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s tu­ition in­dus­try is worth more than $1.4 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est govern­ment sur­vey on house­hold ex­pen­di­ture (Fam­i­lies spent $1.4b on ex­tra tu­ition for chil­dren last year, Sept 2, 2019). This is re­flec­tive of the be­lief that tu­ition is a safety net for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>This can be­come a vi­cious cir­cle – par­ents need­ing to work harder to bring in the ex­tra in­come to fund their chil­dren’s tu­tor­ing ex­pen­di­ture, leading to less time for par­ent-child in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, I be­lieve that when it boils down to choos­ing be­tween aca­demics and a “study-life bal­ance”, some par­ents might choose the lat­ter. Per­haps if par­ents could bet­ter align their val­ues with their choices, chil­dren would grow up with hap­pier child­hoods and as more well-rounded in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
