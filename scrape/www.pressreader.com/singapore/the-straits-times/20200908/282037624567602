    <p>A woman who ac­cused a Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) student of mo­lest­ing her on cam­pus said she had pushed him away and dodged his at­tempts to kiss her ear­lier.</p>
    <p>When he also al­legedly groped her, she prised his fin­gers off.</p>
    <p>But she did not leave be­cause there was no trans­port that early in the morn­ing and she did not want to make things awk­ward be­tween them as they had mu­tual friends.</p>
    <p>The SMU student, Lee Yan Ru, now 24, is fac­ing one mo­lesta­tion charge.</p>
    <p>In the early hours of Jan 8 last year, he is said to have stim­u­lated him­self while he was on top of the woman, who was asleep.</p>
    <p>The woman, who was 21 then, took the stand af­ter lunch yes­ter­day, on the first day of Lee’s trial.</p>
    <p>She tes­ti­fied that she got to know him around De­cem­ber 2018 when he mes­saged her on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>The woman, who stud­ies in an­other univer­sity, can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der.</p>
    <p>She said she had told Lee that she had a boyfriend.</p>
    <p>She then de­scribed what hap­pened that night, say­ing her boyfriend did not know that she was meet­ing Lee.</p>
    <p>They had met up at SMU’s School of Eco­nomics and So­cial Sciences at around 1am on Jan 8 last year to study.</p>
    <p>In a study room, Lee was sit­ting near her at a ta­ble when he placed his foot on her left thigh, the court heard.</p>
    <p>“It was weird and awk­ward... I grabbed his foot and moved it away so that it fell to the floor,” she said.</p>
    <p>But Lee re­peated the same act a few more times, she added.</p>
    <p>She then took her lap­top and rested on the floor to watch a movie on Net­flix, and Lee joined her.</p>
    <p>The woman told District Judge Sharmila Sri­pa­thy that Lee later said that the lights were “really bright” and sug­gested that they go un­der a ta­ble.</p>
    <p>At around 2am, while they were un­der the ta­ble, Lee “tick­led” her armpit and she used her hand to block him.</p>
    <p>The woman said Lee then groped her body af­ter the movie ended at around 4am and she had to prise his fin­gers off.</p>
    <p>When Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor An­dre Chong asked her why she did not leave, she replied: “It was the mid­dle of the night. There was no mode of trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>“I did not want to leave a bad im­pres­sion or make him feel bad. I didn’t want to make things hos­tile.</p>
    <p>“If it’s some­one I didn’t know, I would have got up and just left... I just didn’t have it in me to just walk off.”</p>
    <p>To “break the ten­sion”, she sug­gested go­ing for a smoke break at around 4.45am.</p>
    <p>The court heard that they then re­turned to the study room. The woman said she was sit­ting on a ta­ble when Lee tried to push her down. She tes­ti­fied that he tried to kiss her three times but she dodged him each time.</p>
    <p>The trial re­sumes to­day.</p>
