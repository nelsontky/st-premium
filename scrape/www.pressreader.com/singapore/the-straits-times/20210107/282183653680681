    <p>The funds will go to in­fra­struc­ture that serves the needs of the gen­eral pub­lic.</p>
    <p>MR DIMAS NUGROHO, an as­sis­tant to the co­or­di­nat­ing min­is­ter for eco­nomic af­fairs.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s newly formed sovereign wealth fund (SWF) will ini­tially fo­cus on in­fra­struc­ture in the coun­try and Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day said it would make up for the lim­ited fi­nanc­ing ca­pac­ity at home.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed the In­done­sia In­vest­ment Au­thor­ity (IIA) as a break­through for the fund­ing needed to build and de­velop in­fra­struc­ture at home, point­ing out that pub­lic debt was mount­ing while state-owned com­pa­nies had a limit in their ca­pac­ity to bor­row funds.</p>
    <p>“The SWF is a break­through to fund na­tional devel­op­ment,” Mr Joko, pop­u­larly known as Jokowi at home, said in an ad­dress to all the 34 provin­cial gov­er­nors at the pres­i­den­tial palace.</p>
    <p>He ap­pealed to the gov­er­nors to not ob­struct by way of red tape any in­vest­ment in their re­spec­tive re­gions, say­ing that would be key to eco­nomic re­cov­ery in the postCovid-19 era.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko met the gov­er­nors to brief them on the planned Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme in the coun­try that will start next week and on eco­nomic re­cov­ery ef­forts.</p>
    <p>IIA will utilise its first batch of funds to in­vest in three sec­tors: toll roads, air­ports and sea­ports, an of­fi­cial told The Straits Times ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>“The funds will go to in­fra­struc­ture that serves the needs of the gen­eral pub­lic,” said Mr Dimas Nugroho, an as­sis­tant to the co­or­di­nat­ing min­is­ter for eco­nomic af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Last month, the gov­ern­ment is­sued a reg­u­la­tion on the es­tab­lish­ment of the coun­try’s first SWF. Among other things, it stip­u­lated that IIA will have a su­per­vi­sory board con­sist­ing of five mem­bers – three pro­fes­sion­als and two from the gov­ern­ment rep­re­sented by the serv­ing fi­nance min­is­ter and the state-owned en­ter­prise min­is­ter. The reg­u­la­tion also stated the re­quired ini­tial paid-up cap­i­tal would come from state cof­fers.</p>
    <p>The United Arab Emi­rates (UAE), Japan Bank for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion (JBIC), and the US In­ter­na­tional Devel­op­ment Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion (DFC) as­sisted</p>
    <p>In­done­sia in set­ting up the cor­po­rate gov­er­nance map for the SWF, said a se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>“The ul­ti­mate ob­jec­tive of cre­at­ing the SWF is to pro­vide bet­ter ser­vice to the In­done­sian pub­lic and to cre­ate good cash flow for In­done­sian state-owned en­ter­prises through work­ing with strate­gic part­ners,” the of­fi­cial added.</p>
    <p>A Jakarta-based in­vest­ment banker told The Straits Times that IIA must fo­cus on the coun­try’s crown jew­els if it is to at­tract funds as it has no track record yet.</p>
    <p>He be­lieved that a stake in air­ports around the coun­try, many of which are op­er­at­ing as sub­sidiaries of state-owned com­pa­nies, would be on of­fer through an equity fund.</p>
    <p>“For air­ports, they should fo­cus on Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta air­port, Bali’s Ngu­rah Rai air­port and Surabaya’s Juanda air­port,” said the banker.</p>
    <p>In pre-Covid-19 days, the coun­try’s main in­ter­na­tional air­port, Soekarno-Hatta, boasted an av­er­age pas­sen­ger traf­fic of 60 mil­lion a year while the main tourist is­land of Bali reg­is­tered 24 mil­lion pas­sen­gers i n 2019, and Juanda i n Surabaya, the coun­try’s sec­ond largest city, saw 17 mil­lion in the same year.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter Luhut Pand­jai­tan dis­closed that the gov­ern­ment had se­cured com­mit­ments to IIA amount­ing to no more than US$10 bil­lion (S$13.2 bil­lion) from, among oth­ers, DFC, JBIC, and the Canada Pen­sion Plan In­vest­ment Board.</p>
    <p>The UAE, i nclud­ing the Abu Dhabi In­vest­ment Au­thor­ity and Mubadala, has also made a com­mit­ment but has yet to pro­vide fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Mr Luhut con­ducted a se­ries of road­shows to the United States, Japan and the UAE in the past few months as he and other se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials met their lo­cal coun­ter­parts, as well as in­vestors in­ter­ested in tap­ping In­done­sia’s in­fra­struc­ture projects.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trip to the US, the In­done­sian en­tourage met fund man­agers in­clud­ing Black­rock Group, an Amer­i­can i nvest­ment f und which man­ages US$7.8 tril­lion in as­sets glob­ally.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment bankers say in­vestors such as Mel­bourne-based Transur­ban, which builds and op­er­ates toll roads in Aus­tralia, the US as well as Canada, and Mac­quarie In­fra­struc­ture, which has a stake in Farn­bor­ough Air­port in Bri­tain, may also be in­ter­ested in in­fra­struc­ture projects in In­done­sia.</p>
