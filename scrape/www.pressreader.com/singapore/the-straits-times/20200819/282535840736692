    <p>The iconic Prima Tower Re­volv­ing Restau­rant in Kep­pel Road has taken its last spin be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic. It has closed for good after 43 years of churn­ing out dim sum lunches.</p>
    <p>Its chief oper­at­ing of­fi­cer Kong Yong Yeo told The Straits Times: “The de­ci­sion to close Prima Tower Re­volv­ing Restau­rant was a dif­fi­cult one that was not taken lightly.”</p>
    <p>The restau­rant was meant to close tem­po­rar­ily from April 6 to July 31. “How­ever, the im­pact of the pan­demic on the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try is un­prece­dented and the restau­rant will now cease op­er­a­tions per­ma­nently,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese restau­rant was opened in 1977 by Prima Group, which started as a flour mill but has since branched out into other food busi­nesses. The eatery was lo­cated 60m above ground on top of cylin­dri­cal wheat si­los and spe­cialised in Bei­jing cui­sine.</p>
    <p>It was one of two re­main­ing re­volv­ing restau­rants in Sin­ga­pore, the other be­ing Tong Le Pri­vate Din­ing in Col­lyer Quay.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated next to the Port of Sin­ga­pore, Prima Tower of­fered din­ers panoramic views of Sen­tosa, Mount Faber and Telok Blan­gah as well as the port con­tain­ers. It took slightly over an hour to com­plete a revo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The kitchen was helmed by ex­ec­u­tive chef Chan Sung Og, 65, who had worked at the eatery since it opened.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, it was of­ten packed on week­ends. Its most pop­u­lar dishes were its Pek­ing Duck and Shred­ded Scal­lops With Fish And Egg White.</p>
    <p>It was the only restau­rant in Sin­ga­pore that served a tra­di­tional Bei­jing dessert called Three Non Stick. Made with egg yolks, su­gar and flour, it was a tricky dish con­sid­ered a suc­cess only if it did not stick to the plate, cut­lery or palate.</p>
    <p>Mr Kong said the com­pany has put to­gether a re­trench­ment pack­age for the 30 af­fected em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing with the Food, Drinks and Al­lied Work­ers Union as well as Work­force Sin­ga­pore to help them find jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam Wong, 62, will miss the restau­rant for its “stu­pen­dous view and the novel re­volv­ing el­e­ment”.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic re­la­tions con­sul­tant first vis­ited the restau­rant with his grand­par­ents in the 1970s and was there sev­eral times over the last few years for dim sum.</p>
    <p>He said: “I loved the old-world charm. I re­mem­ber they used to have push­carts for dim sum.”</p>
