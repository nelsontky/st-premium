    <p>PARIS • For­mer Bea­tle John Len­non’s ca­reer was cut short ex­actly 40 years ago when he was shot dead at 40 in New York on Dec 8, 1980, but he lives on in the songs and at­ti­tudes of other artists.</p>
    <p>Many sing his tunes, some men­tion him in their lyrics while oth­ers ques­tion his legacy or even ad­mit they re­ally pre­fer his song­writ­ing part­ner Paul McCart­ney.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the great­est trib­ute to Len­non in re­cent years came from Bob Dy­lan, the Amer­i­can folk-rock gi­ant who was a per­sonal ac­quain­tance.</p>
    <p>The clos­ing track of Dy­lan’s 2012 al­bum Tem­pest was ti­tled Roll On John. The seven-minute dirge re­counts Len­non’s mur­der on Dec 8, 1980, and early life as a tour­ing mu­si­cian, “from the Liver­pool docks to the red-light Ham­burg streets”.</p>
    <p>Among the count­less di­rect cover ver­sions of Len­non’s solo and Bea­tles songs, Ozzy Os­bourne’s 2010 trib­ute stood out: a ver­sion of How? from Len­non’s clas­sic al­bum Imag­ine.</p>
    <p>The ex-leader of heavy metal pi­o­neers Black Sab­bath strolled through New York streets in a black leather trench coat and laid a wreath at Len­non’s me­mo­rial in Cen­tral Park.</p>
    <p>For all the nos­tal­gia, Len­non was a di­vi­sive and con­tra­dic­tory fig­ure. Scep­tics ques­tioned his sta­tus as a coun­ter­cul­ture icon and the sin­cer­ity of his po­si­tions on gen­der equal­ity and cap­i­tal­ism.</p>
    <p>“Len­non had a ‘teddy boy’ side to him,” said mu­sic jour­nal­ist Stan Cuesta, author of a book about The Bea­tles, re­fer­ring to the Liver­pool mu­si­cian’s slick-haired, work­ing­class rebel be­gin­nings. “He once had a Rolls-Royce. He was com­plex.”</p>
    <p>“John was al­ways the provo­ca­teur of the group. He caused a ter­ri­ble scan­dal when he said The Bea­tles were more pop­u­lar than Je­sus,” added Cuesta.</p>
    <p>“But he only got po­lit­i­cal and started go­ing to art gal­leries with Yoko Ono.” Ono was the Ja­panese artist he mar­ried in 1969.</p>
    <p>Even Len­non’s undis­puted mu­si­cal legacy leaves room for dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>As a song­writ­ing part­ner­ship, Len­non and McCart­ney changed the face of mu­sic through their har­monies, said singer Sharleen Spiteri of Bri­tish band Texas.</p>
    <p>Even so, the “who’s your favourite Bea­tle” de­bate is as old as the group them­selves.</p>
    <p>“Len­non had a rather sur­real artis­tic side to him. He was more po­lit­i­cal, re­bel­lious, in­tel­lec­tual,” said Lau­rent Voulzy, a French rocker of The Bea­tles’ gen­er­a­tion. “But as a gui­tarist and bass player my­self, I have al­ways liked Paul’s grace­ful ar­range­ments, the sen­si­tiv­ity of his melodies and lyrics.”</p>
    <p>Cuesta high­lighted an­other track from the Imag­ine al­bum: Jeal­ous Guy, a wist­ful bal­lad that was no­tably covered by singer Bryan Ferry with Roxy Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Len­non “was a nat­u­ral mu­si­cal ge­nius, more in­tu­itive than the other Bea­tles”, Cuesta said, cit­ing also the band’s psy­che­delic hit Straw­berry Fields.</p>
    <p>Like Ar­gen­tine rev­o­lu­tion­ary Che Gue­vara, Len­non’s face ended up on sou­venir T-shirts, some­times in­scribed with the ti­tle of his song, Work­ing Class Hero.</p>
    <p>That an­them summed up Len­non’s legacy for Yves Bigot, a tele­vi­sion executive and for­mer rock critic and record pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>“It tells you to think for your­self,” he said.</p>
