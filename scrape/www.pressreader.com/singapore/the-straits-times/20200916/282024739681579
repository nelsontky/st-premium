    <p>Parti Warisan Sabah chief Shafie Ap­dal’s re-elec­tion campaign has re­ceived a boost be­cause Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s al­lies are bat­tling one an­other in up to 20 seats in the Sept 26 polls in Malaysia’s east­ern­most state.</p>
    <p>The in­cum­bent chief min­is­ter now has the ad­van­tage in over a quar­ter of the 73 seats.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, these are largely in ar­eas where a ma­jor­ity or a sig­nif­i­cant mi­nor­ity is made up of na­tive com­mu­ni­ties – known col­lec­tively as Kadazan Dusun Mu­rut (KDM) – who are seen as po­ten­tial king­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, KDM con­stituen­cies have been swing seats in Sabah, where the state gov­ern­ment has fre­quently changed hands, un­like most of Malaysia’s 12 other states which tend to have long-rul­ing ad­min­is­tra­tions.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s newly formed Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) al­liance will face an up­hill bat­tle against the Warisan-led pact (known as Warisan Plus, or WP) as GRS mem­bers are hand­i­capped out­side of their own strong­hold of Mus­lim seats in the west.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Shafie is dom­i­nant in Mus­lim ar­eas on the east coast as well as in pre­dom­i­nantly Chi­nese ur­ban con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>Hence, the fight for KDM seats in the cen­tral re­gion will largely de­cide who takes con­trol of Sabah.</p>
    <p>In 2018, when the state assem­bly was only 60-strong, WP and the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional (BN) took 29 seats each, with the in­de­pen­dent Home­land Sol­i­dar­ity Party (Star) win­ning two KDM dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>Then, the KDM largely voted for BN, with Mr Shafie viewed as too pro-mi­grant by the ex­tremely na­tivist com­mu­nity. He has worked to win them over in the past two years, such as by hand­ing out land ti­tles in the weeks run­ning up to the campaign.</p>
    <p>“WP has made only patchy in­roads in the past two years into the in­te­rior KDM seats. But with the GRS par­ties now at log­ger­heads, the split vot­ing pat­terns would be to the ad­van­tage of WP,” Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs’ se­nior fel­low and Sabah na­tive Oh</p>
    <p>Ei Sun told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially, GRS – made up of Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN), BN and Parti Ber­satu Sabah (PBS), the old­est sur­viv­ing Sabah-only party – has over­lap­ping claims in 17 seats. This was a sur­pris­ing and em­bar­rass­ing turn for Mr Muhyid­din be­cause the fig­ure had jumped from 11 prior to his visit last Fri­day, dur­ing which at least two meet­ings were held to re­solve the over­lap­ping claims to seats. The meet­ings took place just hours be­fore Nom­i­na­tion Day last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>It closed not just with PBS field­ing seven more than the 15 can­di­dates they had ear­lier an­nounced, but also with six in­de­pen­dents be­ing backed by Star – now a part of PN – after both par­ties chafed at non-lo­cal par­ties be­ing given the lion’s share of the 73 seats.</p>
    <p>That raised the num­ber of clashes among GRS com­po­nents to 20, out of which only two ap­pear to be eas­ily re­tained. Eight were won by WP pre­vi­ously while three are newly cre­ated seats and the re­main­ing seven now look shaky.</p>
    <p>Al­though it is un­likely that Mr Shafie will sweep all 18 wards where GRS ap­pears weak, any win for WP among them will be a sig­nif­i­cant head start in the race to se­cure at least 37 wins for the ma­jor­ity in the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>WP has man­aged to field just one can­di­date for each of the 73 seats, amid the crowded field with a whop­ping 447 hope­fuls in the run­ning.</p>
    <p>“There is a strong anti-Malaya sen­ti­ment, yet these par­ties are tak­ing the ma­jor­ity of seats. This is why we want to con­test with our own flag, and not us­ing PN or BN,” a top PBS leader told The Straits Times, re­fer­ring to Penin­su­lar Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Umno and the Malaysian Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion are con­test­ing a to­tal of 36 seats un­der BN, while Mr Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia has fielded 19 can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that ne­go­ti­a­tions are on­go­ing for some can­di­dates to drop out of the campaign, al­though elec­tion rules for­bid their names from be­ing re­moved from the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Parti Warisan Sabah chief Shafie Ap­dal is dom­i­nant in Mus­lim ar­eas on the east coast as well as in pre­dom­i­nantly Chi­nese ur­ban con­stituen­cies. Hence, the fight for Kadazan Dusun Mu­rut (na­tive com­mu­ni­ties) seats in the cen­tral re­gion will largely de­cide who takes con­trol of Sabah.</p>
