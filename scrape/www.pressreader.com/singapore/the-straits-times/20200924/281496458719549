    <p>The former maid of prom­i­nent busi­ness­man Liew Mun Leong is seek­ing the court’s per­mis­sion for an in­quiry into the con­duct of the two pros­e­cu­tors in her case.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti Liyani, 46, filed the com­plaint in June against Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Tan Wee Hao and Tan Yany­ing, who had pros­e­cuted her case in the State Courts for theft.</p>
    <p>She was ac­quit­ted on ap­peal to the High Court ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>A High Court pre-trial con­fer­ence was held yes­ter­day in cham­bers, said her lawyer Anil Balchan­dani.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti’s ap­pli­ca­tion – known as an orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons – was taken out on an ex parte ba­sis, which means only the ap­pli­cant can be heard, un­less the court says oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) last month filed a sum­mons to seek leave from the court for the two le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers to ap­pear and be heard, through State Coun­sel rep­re­sent­ing them, in the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, an In­done­sian who worked for the Liew fam­ily from 2007 to 2016, had been con­victed by the lower court of steal­ing over $34,000 worth of items from them.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn, in ac­quit­ting Ms Parti, had taken is­sue on sev­eral counts with how the case was han­dled.</p>
    <p>He noted that the Liew fam­ily could have been mo­ti­vated to ter­mi­nate Ms Parti’s em­ploy­ment abruptly and file the police re­port in or­der to pre­vent her from re­port­ing her il­le­gal de­ploy­ment to work at the house and of­fice of Mr Liew’s son.</p>
    <p>The judge had also found there was a break in the chain of cus­tody of ev­i­dence. This cre­ated a rea­son­able doubt as to whether some of the al­legedly stolen items dis­cov­ered by the fam­ily were ac­cu­rately doc­u­mented by the pho­tographs taken by the police some five weeks later. Jus­tice Chan also found that two state­ments were taken from Ms Parti with­out an in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the ap­peal, a de­mon­stra­tion had shown that a DVD player al­legedly stolen by Ms Parti, which a Liew fam­ily mem­ber had tes­ti­fied was not bro­ken, dis­played a “could not ini­tialise disc” er­ror mes­sage when a DVD was in­serted into it.</p>
    <p>At the lower court trial, it had been shown that the de­vice could play a video dig­i­tally stored in the hard disk.</p>
    <p>In the light of the High Court judg­ment, the AGC had said it was re­view­ing the han­dling of the case.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Min­istry of Man­power said it was in con­sul­ta­tion with the AGC on whether fur­ther ac­tion ought to be taken in this case.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Police Force also said it was look­ing into how its in­ves­ti­ga­tions were con­ducted.</p>
    <p>At this stage, only leave for an in­quiry to be held is be­ing sought un­der the orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons filed by Ms Parti.</p>
    <p>The in­quiry pre­cedes the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal pro­ceed­ings on whether there are grounds for con­ven­ing one.</p>
    <p>If Ms Parti suc­ceeds in her ap­pli­ca­tion, a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal may then be ap­pointed to hear the case and sub­mit its find­ings to the Chief Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice can dis­miss the case if the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal finds no cause of suf­fi­cient grav­ity for dis­ci­plinary ac­tion, or give or­ders to have pun­ish­ments im­posed such as cen­sure, pay­ing a penalty of up to $20,000, or any other or­der deemed ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti had filed the sum­mons un­der Sec­tion 82A of the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion Act, which deals with mis­con­duct by le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers and the penal­ties if they are found guilty.</p>
