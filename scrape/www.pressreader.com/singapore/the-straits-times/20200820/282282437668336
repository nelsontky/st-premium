    <p>LON­DON • For­mula One’s 10 teams have com­mit­ted to the sport un­til at least the end of 2025 by putting their sig­na­tures to a new com­mer­cial Con­corde Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent agree­ment, which sets out the terms un­der which teams race and the share of rev­enues, is set to ex­pire at the end of this year.</p>
    <p>F1 and the gov­ern­ing FIA yes­ter­day said in a joint state­ment the agree­ment will se­cure the longterm sus­tain­able fu­ture for the sport and re­duce the fi­nan­cial and on track dis­par­i­ties be­tween the teams.</p>
    <p>“This year has been un­prece­dented for the world and we are proud that For­mula One has come to­gether in re­cent months to re­turn to rac­ing in a safe way,” F1 chair­man Chase Carey said.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions over a new Con­corde Agree­ment had been put on hold due to the Covid-19 cri­sis that hit the teams and sport fi­nan­cially.</p>
    <p>F1’s three old­est and most suc­cess­ful teams – Ferrari, McLaren and Wil­liams – were the first to sign with rights hold­ers Lib­erty Me­dia and the FIA on Tues­day, with the seven other teams fol­low­ing suit yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is the right deal at the right time for the sport, its own­ers, its teams and, most of all, the fans,” said McLaren chief ex­ec­u­tive Zak Brown in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“A more eq­ui­table sport is bet­ter for every­one: Greater bal­ance in the shar­ing of rev­enues among all the teams and clearer, sim­pler gov­er­nance that cuts through vested in­ter­ests and puts the sport first,” added Brown, whose team have com­peted in F1 since 1966.</p>
    <p>Mercedes were also on board de­spite ear­lier re­sis­tance, with team boss Toto Wolff say­ing the new agree­ment hurt his team the most fi­nan­cially while Ferrari had “main­tained an ad­van­ta­geous po­si­tion”.</p>
    <p>Ferrari chief ex­ec­u­tive Louis Camil­leri said it was an im­por­tant step to en­sure the sport’s sta­bil­ity and growth.</p>
    <p>“We are very con­fi­dent that the col­lab­o­ra­tion with the FIA and Lib­erty Me­dia can make For­mula One even more at­trac­tive and spec­tac­u­lar, while pre­serv­ing its sta­tus as the ul­ti­mate tech­no­log­i­cal chal­lenge,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Ferrari are the only team to have raced in ev­ery sea­son since the first in 1950. The Ital­ian team have won 16 con­struc­tors’ ti­tles and 15 driv­ers’ crowns.</p>
    <p>This is the right deal at the right time for the sport, its own­ers, its teams and, most of all, the fans. ’’</p>
    <p>ZAK BROWN, McLaren chief ex­ec­u­tive, on the 2021-2025 Con­corde Agree­ment.</p>
