    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land was rac­ing to track down about 200 peo­ple in its north­ern prov­inces yes­ter­day to stop a po­ten­tial Covid-19 out­break af­ter three Thai na­tion­als en­tered the coun­try il­le­gally from Myan­mar and tested pos­i­tive days later.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Viet­nam con­firmed its first lo­cally trans­mit­ted Covid-19 case i n nearly three months, af­ter the in­fec­tion of a man re­lated to a flight at­ten­dant who had tested pos­i­tive af­ter re­turn­ing from Ja­pan two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s health min­is­ter or­dered prov­inces and state agen­cies to tighten screen­ing, and con­tact trac­ing ef­forts were launched af­ter the 32-year-old man was con­firmed as the first re­ported do­mes­tic in­fec­tion in 89 days.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said the man taught at lan­guage-learn­ing cen­tres and had been to cafes and karaoke bars since his ex­po­sure to the flight at­ten­dant. Those places had since been closed.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, the three women by­passed im­mi­gra­tion checks and en­tered via nat­u­ral bor­der cross­ings last Tues­day and Fri­day, skip­ping the manda­tory quar­an­tine for new ar­rivals, ac­cord­ing to Chi­ang Rai’s provin­cial gov­er­nor Pra­chon Prat­sakul.</p>
    <p>There were 356 po­ten­tially ex­posed peo­ple in Chi­ang Rai and Chi­ang Mai prov­inces, among them em­ploy­ees and cus­tomers of a ho­tel, shop­ping mall, cin­ema, restau­rants and pas­sen­gers in a van and taxi, Mr Pra­chon said.</p>
    <p>So far, more than 150 peo­ple in the north­ern prov­inces have been found and have tested neg­a­tive, se­nior health of­fi­cial So­pon Iam­siritha­worn said.</p>
    <p>The first of the three new cases ar­rived last Tues­day in Chi­ang Rai and trav­elled to Chi­ang Mai, where she later showed coro­n­avirus symp­toms and went to a hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Two others who worked in the same en­ter­tain­ment venue in Myan­mar re­turned on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>They stayed at a lo­cal ho­tel and later sought Covid-19 tests, which were pos­i­tive.</p>
