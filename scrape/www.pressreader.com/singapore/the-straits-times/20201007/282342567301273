    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK There is not a lot of rhyme or rea­son to the cho­sen pur­suits of the chil­dren born to the world’s great ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Bronny James, Lebron’s el­dest son, is a top bas­ket­ball prospect, but the chil­dren of tennis greats An­dre Agassi and St­effi Graf never showed much in­ter­est in the sport.</p>
    <p>Then there is Cameron Bur­rell, who won the Na­tional Col­le­giate Ath­letic As­so­ci­a­tion (NCAA) cham­pi­onship 100m in 2018. His best time is 9.93sec, mak­ing him one of the fastest sprint­ers in the world.</p>
    <p>His father, Leroy, is an Olympic gold medal­list and the for­mer world-record holder in the 100m. His mother, Michelle Finn-Bur­rell, has a sprint re­lay gold medal from the 1992 Olympics too.</p>
    <p>His aunt Dawn Bur­rell was an Olympic long jumper, and one of his god­fa­thers is also a sprinter of some renown – Carl Lewis.</p>
    <p>Now comes the hard part, be­cause while it is cer­tainly not easy to be among the very few to run 100m in less than 10 sec­onds, com­pet­ing in the shadow of Olympic leg­ends who hap­pen to be in the fam­ily may be even more dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Also, the past two years, since</p>
    <p>Cameron com­pleted his col­lege ca­reer, have been filled with nag­ging in­juries, pe­ri­ods of sag­ging con­fi­dence, lo­gis­ti­cal has­sles, dis­ap­point­ing races, and now an Olympics de­layed a year by a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I run just as fast as most pros and well enough to be ranked and make na­tional teams, I just don’t do it of­ten enough,” he said.</p>
    <p>So where does the 26-year-old turn to for guid­ance? Lewis and Leroy are his coaches. If they are on the road, his mother fills in.</p>
    <p>All of them have high ex­pec­ta­tions for him, given what he has al­ready ac­com­plished.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dif­fi­cult bur­den for him to carry, but it’s his job, and he has to do it some­how,” Leroy said.</p>
    <p>Michelle added: “The other part, though, is bal­anc­ing the work and over­think­ing. He has to want it for him­self, not for me, not for Leroy.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter sprint­ing be­came his call­ing, Bur­rell chose the Univer­sity of Hous­ton, the school his father and Lewis helped turn into a speed mecca in the 1980s, and where his father has coached for 22 years. Lewis be­came an as­sis­tant coach there in 2014.</p>
    <p>Since col­lege, Bur­rell and sev­eral</p>
    <p>of his team­mates have con­tin­ued to train as part of a pro­fes­sional group that his father and Lewis set up so the best run­ners could stay in Hous­ton and work out to­gether.</p>
    <p>For Bur­rell, the tran­si­tion to pro­fes­sional run­ning has not gone as smoothly as it has for some of his peers.</p>
    <p>He strug­gled to ad­just to new chal­lenges – be­ing alone while com</p>
    <p>pet­ing in Ja­pan for two weeks, or hav­ing the air­line lose his ath­letic bag and clothes on a trip to a com­pe­ti­tion in Eng­land. He has blue-chip spon­sors – Red Bull and Nike – but knows he must per­form at the high­est level to keep them.</p>
    <p>“New lev­els, new devils”, he said. Oth­ers his age have had bet­ter re­sults. Chris­tian Cole­man, a col­lege ri­val who is 18 months younger, won 100m gold at the world cham­pi­onships in Doha last year. Bur­rell did not make that na­tional team.</p>
    <p>Lewis said: “I told him he has to take any con­cerns he has about mak­ing the Olympic team off the ta­ble. I said, ‘If you run the time you have al­ready run, you have made it’.”</p>
    <p>Sprint­ing 100m seems like it should be the sim­plest event in sports, an all-out burst. It is not.</p>
    <p>“It’s about man­ag­ing speed­ing up and slow­ing down for 90m,” Lewis said.</p>
    <p>Elite sprint­ers do not reach top speed un­til about the 50m mark, and they can only stay at top speed for 10m or so. The mar­gin for er­ror is mi­nus­cule.</p>
    <p>Leroy said there are some things his son could im­prove on to be­come a con­sis­tent sub-10sec run­ner.</p>
    <p>He needs more con­fi­dence in his start and to bet­ter main­tain his stride length and fre­quency through the fin­ish. He needs to bal­ance his weaker left side with his stronger right. He could re­lax and en­joy the pur­suit of his dream a lit­tle more, too, his father said, though the sports ac­tu­ar­ial ta­bles say he is just about to reach his ath­letic prime.</p>
    <p>“He could have done any­thing he wanted, and he chose to run,” Leroy said of his son. “He’s got to re­ally go get it this year.”</p>
