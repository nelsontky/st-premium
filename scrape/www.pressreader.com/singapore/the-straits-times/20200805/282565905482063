    <p>DUBAI • Saud Waled Ibrahim raps in a mix­ture of Ara­bic and English, a blend that has be­come a hall­mark of a hip-hop scene in search of its iden­tity in the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE).</p>
    <p>The burly Emi­rati, bet­ter known as SG, is record­ing a new track in his small but mod­ern stu­dio in a lowkey part of the Gulf state best known for its glit­ter­ing sky­scrapers and ar­ti­fi­cial palm-shaped is­lands.</p>
    <p>“There is no coun­try that doesn’t have rap... but we’re still seen as in­trud­ers,” said the 24-year-old, sport­ing an over-sized Adi­das</p>
    <p>T-shirt and oblig­a­tory head­phones.</p>
    <p>In a coun­try made up of res­i­dents drawn from all over the world and with lit­tle street cul­ture to speak of, the hip-hop scene has yet to find its “sound”, he said.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up to the beats of Amer­i­can rap­pers Tu­pac and Eminem, SG said it was the genre’s tra­di­tion of free ex­pres­sion that drew him in, even if as the years went by, re­al­ity bit.</p>
    <p>“As we got older, we re­alised we are a so­ci­ety with deep-rooted prin­ci­ples, which we can’t vi­o­late,” he said of his gen­er­a­tion of per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>Born in the street cul­ture of the United States in the 1970s, hip-hop has spread across the world and given a voice to young peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly those in marginalis­ed com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Be­fore making its way to the Gulf, rap emerged as an art form in other Arab coun­tries, where per­form­ers defy cen­sor­ship and re­pres­sion to ad­dress sen­si­tive po­lit­i­cal and so­cial is­sues.</p>
    <p>The oil-rich UAE is con­sid­ered one of the more open states in the Gulf re­gion, even if se­cu­rity laws re­main strin­gent.</p>
    <p>It has in­vested heav­ily in arts and cul­tural events and a hand­ful of home-grown rap names have emerged among those who have set­tled in the UAE, in­clud­ing Freek and Adamil­lion, who are both from So­ma­lia.</p>
    <p>But like the wider cul­tural scene, the hip-hop com­mu­nity is try­ing to find its place in a con­ser­va­tive coun­try, where for­eign­ers make up about 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion and where provoca­tive or ex­plicit top­ics are taboo.</p>
    <p>“Un­like in France, the US, Morocco, Egypt... we don’t have our own sound be­cause we are more fo­cused on for­eign in­flu­ences rather than our own cre­ativ­ity,” SG said.</p>
    <p>Has­sane “Big Hass” Den­naoui, a UAE-based host of a ra­dio show ded­i­cated to hip-hop, said al­though iden­tity i n t he re­gion is still evolv­ing, one thing for sure is that it is “one of di­ver­sity”.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally from Saudi Ara­bia, Big Hass, with his sig­na­ture ban­dana and white beard, founded The Beat DXB, which or­gan­ises live per­for­mances and pro­motes re­gional artists.</p>
    <p>By draw­ing per­form­ers from all over the world, the UAE is rich in lan­guages and cul­ture, he said, even if many are con­tent to stick to lyrics about life and l ove rather than po­lit­i­cal is­sues of the day.</p>
    <p>“When I talk to a Pales­tinian rap­per, he asks how can we talk about love when I have an army tank on the roof of my house?” he said at Dubai’s in­de­pen­dent Cin­ema Akil, a favourite hip­ster haunt.</p>
    <p>“In the Gulf, we may live com­fort­ably, but that doesn’t mean peo­ple don’t have strug­gles. As a rap­per, you have a duty to rep­re­sent the re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>To re­lay that re­al­ity, Pales­tinian rap­per Suhaib S. Alises, who was born in Jor­dan but grew up in the UAE, per­forms in a mix­ture of English and Ara­bic.</p>
    <p>“This is to reach as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble... and, at the same time, drive my mes­sage across,” he said. “There should al­ways first and fore­most be a mes­sage and rap is an ex­pres­sion of po­etry and emo­tion.”</p>
    <p>His in­spi­ra­tions range from the great Arab singers such as leg­endary Le­banese diva Fairuz to the plight of his peo­ple and AfricanAme­r­i­can cul­ture.</p>
    <p>For him, the genre has evolved from the days of “gangsta rap” that dom­i­nated his teenage years.</p>
    <p>“It has be­come a re­spect­ful form of ex­pres­sion and adapts to where the per­son is... ad­dress­ing what is hap­pen­ing around the per­son’s life and his re­al­ity,” he said.</p>
