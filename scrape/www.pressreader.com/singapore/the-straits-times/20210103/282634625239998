    <p>In­vest­ing is about grow­ing your pot of gold, but part of it is also about en­joy­ing what you reap, says in­vest­ment pro­fes­sional Anub­huti Gupta.</p>
    <p>Ms Gupta, 39, de­scribes in­vest­ing as “a balanc­ing act be­tween achiev­ing fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity, grow­ing wealth and en­joy­ing” the spoils in a mean­ing­ful way.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing a cool head dur­ing a cri­sis such as the tur­bu­lent mar­kets this year is also vi­tal.</p>
    <p>She adds: “As a long-term in­vestor, I be­lieve that the best way to go through a cri­sis is to avoid panic sell­ing and to use the low prices as an op­por­tu­nity to in­vest fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>Ms Gupta is the head of in­vest­ments for the Asia-Pa­cific for a strat­egy known as Rosenberg Equities un­der AXA In­vest­ment Man­agers.</p>
    <p>The global as­set man­ager of­fers in­vest­ment so­lu­tions for a range of as­sets from equities to fixed in­come, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Gupta says: “We see Asia as key to our global busi­ness growth and will con­tinue to in­vest here. The re­gion is go­ing through a rapid pace of trans­for­ma­tion and wealth cre­ation, with ex­cit­ing de­vel­op­ments in fi­nance, responsibl­e in­vest­ing and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore, with its many ad­van­tages, is very well placed to strengthen its po­si­tion as a gate­way to Asia’s as­set and wealth man­age­ment in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>Ms Gupta, a Sin­ga­porean, is mar­ried to a trader at UBS Sin­ga­pore. They do not have chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She holds a bachelor’s de­gree in engi­neer­ing and a mas­ter’s de­gree in fi­nan­cial engi­neer­ing from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, as well as a cer­tifi­cate in com­pu­ta­tional fi­nance from Carnegie Mel­lon Univer­sity Tep­per School of Busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, she holds cre­den­tials as a char­tered fi­nan­cial an­a­lyst and char­tered al­ter­na­tive in­vest­ment an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>Ms Gupta is also ac­tively in­volved in the Fi­nan­cial Women’s As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore as a mentor to em­power fe­male lead­ers in fi­nance.</p>
    <p>What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>My port­fo­lio com­prises eq­uity funds, cash, fixed de­posits, en­dow­ment poli­cies and real es­tate.</p>
    <p>Equities used to be the big­gest po­si­tion in my port­fo­lio un­til my hus­band and I pur­chased our house in 2017. Since then, real es­tate has dis­placed equities as the dom­i­nant as­set class in my port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>I in­vest for the long term and avoid tim­ing the mar­kets.</p>
    <p>I plan to add more long-term eq­uity ex­po­sure through ac­tive funds, fo­cus­ing on low-risk com­pa­nies and those with sus­tain­able earn­ings growth, or those that are ben­e­fi­cia­ries of mega trends like the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It is part of my reg­u­lar port­fo­lio re­bal­anc­ing to hit the tar­get ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>When I was a child, I would save all my pocket money and as a re­sult, end up with a re­spectable cash re­serve in my early ado­les­cent years, which my fa­ther helped me to in­vest in a govern­ment plan in In­dia. I was fas­ci­nated by the fact that it dou­bled in five years.</p>
    <p>What re­ally ce­mented my interest in pur­su­ing in­vest­ing as a ca­reer was the dis­cov­ery of the mas­ter’s pro­gramme in fi­nan­cial engi­neer­ing. I was fas­ci­nated by the con­cepts of mod­ern fi­nance and the abil­ity to ap­proach the un­struc­tured world of in­vest­ing in a struc­tured way, much like engi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan? De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Three fac­tors drive my per­sonal in­vest­ment strat­egy. First, the stage of life one is at is a key de­ter­mi­nant of the risk one can take on. Se­cond, long-term mar­ket trends in­form re­turn ex­pec­ta­tions. Lastly, I need proper man­age­ment of risk in view of my as­sets, li­a­bil­i­ties and life as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>As we ad­vance through our life stages, gen­er­ally, the fo­cus shifts from wealth ac­cu­mu­la­tion and growth to preser­va­tion and, even­tu­ally, de­cu­mu­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In the first decade or so af­ter start­ing work, I took on more risk and in­vested pri­mar­ily in stocks and eq­uity funds with a fo­cus on cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion. Now I am fo­cus­ing on wealth preser­va­tion and mod­er­ate growth and have shifted my port­fo­lio to a more bal­anced mix of in­fla­tion pro­tec­tion, equities and fixed in­come.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has merely ac­cel­er­ated the long-term in­vest­ment trends al­ready at play, such as climate change, in­vest­ing for so­cial im­pact, the rise of China, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and lower interest rates. In­sur­ance is very im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>I have life, med­i­cal and crit­i­cal ill­ness poli­cies to pro­tect against un­ex­pected events which can jeop­ar­dise my and my fam­ily’s fi­nances.</p>
    <p>I also plan on putting my will in place as I enter the next decade of my life.</p>
    <p>I would like to in­vest in some­thing re­lated to ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>I am very pas­sion­ate about the role ed­u­ca­tion can play in bring­ing about equal­ity in so­ci­ety and rais­ing the col­lec­tive lev­els of hap­pi­ness and sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>I am fo­cused on cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion but will grad­u­ally shift to­wards reg­u­lar in­come gen­er­a­tion and lower-risk in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>My hus­band and I plan to mon­e­tise our house to gen­er­ate reg­u­lar in­come dur­ing re­tire­ment as our needs will be dif­fer­ent then. We will con­sider ren­tal ar­bi­trage, cap­i­tal gains re­al­i­sa­tion, re­verse mort­gage or some­thing that makes the most fi­nan­cial and prac­ti­cal sense.</p>
    <p>I am a huge fan of the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sys­tem.</p>
    <p>With the low-rates en­vi­ron­ment we have been in glob­ally, the interest rates for CPF ac­counts are ex­tremely at­trac­tive given the level of risk.</p>
    <p>I also plan to top up my re­tire­ment ac­count in the fu­ture to in­crease CPF Life pay­outs.</p>
    <p>I reg­u­larly con­trib­ute to the Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme to en­joy tax ben­e­fits and boost my sav­ings fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>FAN OF CPF SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>My fa­ther started out as an en­gi­neer at the steel divi­sion of a busi­ness con­glom­er­ate in In­dia and pro­gres­sively took on di­verse tech­ni­cal and man­age­ment roles in sugar, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and con­sumer di­vi­sions. He worked with them un­til he died at the age of 60.</p>
    <p>My mother is a housewife and has played an im­por­tant role in build­ing our fam­ily sav­ings through pru­dent man­age­ment of house­hold fi­nances and care­ful bud­get­ing. She is based in In­dia.</p>
    <p>I have a younger brother in Sin­ga­pore work­ing as a busi­ness con­sul­tant.</p>
    <p>I grew up in a mid­dle-class fam­ily. Our life­style was sim­ple and com­fort­able, with oc­ca­sional in­dul­gences, but not spend­ing be­yond our means. My par­ents got the balance right be­tween sav­ings and con­sump­tion, pru­dence and plea­sure. They al­ways stressed the im­por­tance of ed­u­ca­tion and fi­nan­cial in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>My par­ents used to dis­cuss our fam­ily fi­nances and in­cul­cated a very strong sav­ings ethos in me from a very young age.</p>
    <p>I would save up all my hong­bao and ask for “liq­uid” money from my par­ents for spend­ing.</p>
    <p>I was also deeply im­pacted in my early years by the sig­nif­i­cant losses my grand­fa­ther in­curred in stock in­vest­ments. While he had been a very pru­dent in­vestor all his life, he did not fully un­der­stand, nor did he do his due dili­gence, and al­lowed him­self to be swayed by the prom­ises of out­sized gains, only to see the com­pany go bust.</p>
    <p>This taught me two very im­por­tant lessons.</p>
    <p>First, risk man­age­ment is cen­tral to suc­cess­ful in­vest­ing and se­cond, if you don’t un­der­stand what you are in­vest­ing in, you bet­ter avoid it.</p>
    <p>I am a huge fan of the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sys­tem. With the low-rates en­vi­ron­ment we have been in glob­ally, the interest rates for CPF ac­counts are ex­tremely at­trac­tive given the level of risk.</p>
    <p>Home is now ...</p>
    <p>A landed house in the east. It is suf­fi­ciently re­moved from the hus­tle and bus­tle of the city but still con­ve­niently lo­cated to get around and spa­cious enough for our fam­ily.</p>
    <p>I drive ...</p>
    <p>I never felt the need to pick up driv­ing in Sin­ga­pore, given the im­pres­sive public trans­port in­fra­struc­ture we have here.</p>
