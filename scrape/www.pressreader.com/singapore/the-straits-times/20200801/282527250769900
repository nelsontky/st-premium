    <p>I have a</p>
    <p>14-year-old male cat. Re­cently I dis­cov­ered a lump near his hind legs. It looks like a fatty lump. Do I need to take him to a vet to check if it is can­cer­ous?</p>
    <p>The last time I took him to the vet for a rou­tine check-up, he ended up not be­ing able to uri­nate when he came home. We had to take him to the hos­pi­tal af­ter that. Jesseca Lim</p>
    <p>It is not pos­si­ble to tell just from its ap­pear­ance if a lump is can­cer­ous, which is why it is im­por­tant to take your cat to the vet­eri­nar­ian to have it checked out. The vet might take a sam­ple by do­ing a fine nee­dle as­pi­rate or do other di­ag­nos­tics.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, con­tinue mon­i­tor­ing the size of the lump to see if it grows or if there are changes in its ap­pear­ance or con­sis­tency (hard or soft).</p>
    <p>Stress could be a fac­tor for your cat’s uri­nary tract is­sues, which might have de­vel­oped af­ter a stress­ful event such as travel, es­pe­cially if the pet does not usu­ally leave the house.</p>
    <p>But it is still im­por­tant to make sure the is­sue is checked out.</p>
    <p>Try to get your cat used to be­ing in the car­rier and as­so­ci­ate it with pos­i­tive things to re­duce the stress of trav­el­ling. This could in­volve us­ing pos­i­tive re­in­force­ment, such as treats, to en­cour­age your pet to go into the car­rier will­ingly. Over time, the pet may de­velop a pos­i­tive as­so­ci­a­tion with the car­rier.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, there are also vet­eri­nar­i­ans that pro­vide house­call ser­vices. As these con­sul­ta­tions are done in a fa­mil­iar en­vi­ron­ment at home, it could be less stress­ful for some an­i­mals.</p>
