    <p>Huawei was the world’s big­gest smart­phone maker as re­cently as the sec­ond quar­ter of last year, but the Honor sale and chip short­age will likely take it out of the top six this year, said data firm Trend­force.</p>
    <p>Huawei Tech­nolo­gies this year will likely see slower 5G busi­ness and push fur­ther into soft­ware, while hop­ing its smart­phones get a re­prieve from United States sanc­tions which last year struck the chip-re­liant heart of its group, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>Lim­ited ac­cess to high-end semi­con­duc­tors means ra­tioning dur­ing China’s net­work up­grade, they said, while the dis­sec­tion of its mo­bile arm will send Huawei tum­bling down rank­ings as it con­tin­ues to de­velop a pro­pri­etary op­er­at­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>China’s lead­ing telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment maker found it­self on a US trade black­list in May 2019 due to na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns. Huawei has re­peat­edly de­nied it is a se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>That ef­fec­tively banned USbased firms from sell­ing Huawei es­sen­tial Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the ban was ex­tended to for­eign firms with US busi­ness, reach­ing chief sup­pli­ers such as Taiwan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing (TSMC).</p>
    <p>The change hit an Achilles heel as Huawei de­pends on TSMC to make ad­vanced chips for its hand­sets, fifth-gen­er­a­tion (5G) net­work base sta­tions, servers, and cloud com­put­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence prod­ucts, said Mr Paul Tri­olo, head of global tech pol­icy at Eura­sia Group. Stock­piles only last so long, he said.</p>
    <p>“Passage of this death sen­tence does not in­volve a swift ex­e­cu­tion,” tech­nol­ogy an­a­lyst Dan Wang said in a client note.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, the process is much more like a slow stran­gu­la­tion.” Huawei de­clined to com­ment. Mr Wang said Huawei will feel the im­pact most acutely in its con­sumer busi­ness, which brought in 54 per cent of rev­enue in 2019.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, Huawei spun off bud­get smart­phone line Honor in a sale founder Ren Zhengfei said would al­low the brand to re­gain ac­cess to chips.</p>
    <p>Huawei could look to do the same with its premium lines this year, Mr Tri­olo said.</p>
    <p>Huawei was the world’s big­gest smart­phone maker as re­cently as the sec­ond quar­ter of last year, but the Honor sale and chip short­age will likely take it out of the top six this year, said data firm Trend­force.</p>
    <p>Its luck may change with the US pres­i­den­tial in­au­gu­ra­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den, from whom an­a­lysts ex­pect more le­niency to­wards Huawei’s smart­phone busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ra­tion this month comes as Huawei chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Meng Wanzhou dis­cusses a deal with US pros­e­cu­tors over al­le­ga­tions of do­ing busi­ness with Iran.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Huawei will likely fo­cus on the Har­mony op­er­at­ing sys­tem it is de­vel­op­ing for its smart­phones af­ter be­ing cut off from Al­pha­bet’s An­droid, said Ms Ni­cole Peng, vice-pres­i­dent of mo­bil­ity at con­sul­tancy Canalys.</p>
    <p>Else­where in soft­ware, Huawei will likely pivot more to­wards ser­vices such as cloud com­put­ing and In­ter­net-of-Things de­vices, though these are un­likely to off­set the slow­down in smart­phones and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion in­fra­struc­ture, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>Huawei’s net­work busi­ness does have bright prospects, but with ma­jor mar­kets such as Bri­tain and Japan ban­ning its equip­ment, it will likely fo­cus on China, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has enough chips to make around 500,000 5G base sta­tions, said Jef­feries an­a­lyst Edi­son Lee.</p>
    <p>Yet rather than use up that sup­ply, the gov­ern­ment will likely slow 5G in­tro­duc­tion, tak­ing “a mid­dle-of-the-road ap­proach to bal­ance be­tween ex­pand­ing cov­er­age and wait­ing for Huawei to catch up”, he said.</p>
