    <p>MI­AMI • In Florida, less than onequar­ter of de­liv­ered coro­n­avirus vac­cines have been used, even as older peo­ple sat in lawn chairs all night wait­ing for their shots.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, doc­tors are wor­ried about whether there will be enough hospi­tal staff to ad­min­is­ter vac­cines and tend to the swelling num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>These sorts of lo­gis­ti­cal prob­lems in clin­ics across the United States have put the cam­paign to vac­ci­nate the pop­u­la­tion against Covid-19 far be­hind sched­ule in its third week, rais­ing fears about how quickly the coun­try will be able to tame the epi­demic.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral of­fi­cials said their goal was to have 20 mil­lion peo­ple get their first shot by the end of last year. More than 14 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vac­cines had been sent out across the US. But the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) said that only 2.8 mil­lion peo­ple have re­ceived their first dose, al­though that num­ber may be some­what low due to re­port­ing lags.</p>
    <p>States vary widely in how many of the doses they have re­ceived have been given out. South Dakota leads with more than 48 per cent of its doses given, fol­lowed by West Vir­ginia at 38 per cent. In con­trast, Kansas has given out less than 11 per cent, and Ge­or­gia, less than 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>Com­pound­ing the challenges, fed­eral of­fi­cials say they do not fully un­der­stand the cause of the de­lays. But state health of­fi­cials and hospi­tal lead­ers across the coun­try pointed to sev­eral fac­tors.</p>
    <p>States have held back doses to be given out to their nurs­ing homes and other long-term-care fa­cil­i­ties, an ef­fort that is just gear­ing up and ex­pected to take sev­eral months. Across the coun­try, just 8 per cent of the doses given to these fa­cil­i­ties have been ad­min­is­tered, with 2 mil­lion yet to be given.</p>
    <p>The hol­i­day sea­son has meant that peo­ple are away and clin­ics have re­duced hours, slow­ing the pace of vac­cine ad­min­is­tra­tion. In Florida, the de­mand for the vac­cines dipped over the Christ­mas hol­i­day and is ex­pected to dip again over New Year’s, Gover­nor Ron DeSan­tis said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>And crit­i­cally, public health ex­perts say, fed­eral of­fi­cials have left many of the de­tails of the fi­nal stage of the vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion process, such as sched­ul­ing and staffing, to over­stretched lo­cal health of­fi­cials and hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>In one no­table blun­der, 42 peo­ple in Boone County, West Vir­ginia, who were to re­ceive the vac­cine were mis­tak­enly in­jected with an ex­per­i­men­tal mon­o­clonal an­ti­body treat­ment in­stead.</p>
    <p>“We’ve taken the peo­ple with the least amount of re­sources and ca­pac­ity and asked them to do the hard­est part of the vac­ci­na­tion – which is ac­tu­ally get­ting the vac­cines ad­min­is­tered into peo­ple’s arms,” said Brown Univer­sity’s School of Public Health dean Ashish Jha.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral and state of­fi­cials have de­nied they are to blame for the slow roll-out. Of­fi­cials be­hind Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, the fed­eral ef­fort to fast-track vac­cines, have said their job was to en­sure that vac­cines are made avail­able and get shipped out to the states.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Twit­ter on Tues­day that it was “up to the States to dis­trib­ute the vac­cines once brought to the des­ig­nated ar­eas by the Fed­eral Govern­ment”.</p>
    <p>The US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) re­lief pack­age that Mr Trump signed into law will bring some re­lief to strug­gling state and lo­cal health de­part­ments. The Bill sets aside more than US$8 bil­lion for vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion, on top of the US$340 mil­lion that the CDC sent out to the states in in­stal­ments be­tween Septem­ber and De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>That in­fu­sion of money is wel­come, if late, said Pro­fes­sor Bob Wachter, chair­man of the Depart­ment of Medicine at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Pratt, a spokesman for Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, said there will al­ways be lags be­tween the num­ber of doses that have been al­lo­cated, shipped, in­jected and re­ported. “We’re work­ing to make those lags as small as pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>The task of ad­min­is­ter­ing thou­sands of vac­cines is daunt­ing for health de­part­ments that have al­ready been over­bur­dened by re­spond­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Mont­gomery County, Mary­land, the health depart­ment has re­cruited ex­tra staff to help man­age vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>“While we’re try­ing to roll out vac­ci­na­tions, we’re also con­tin­u­ing the pan­demic re­sponse by sup­port­ing test­ing, con­tact trac­ing, dis­ease con­trol and all of those other as­pects of the Covid re­sponse,” said county health of­fi­cer Travis Gayles.</p>
    <p>Also, the county health depart­ment gets just a few days’ no­tice each week of the tim­ing of its vac­cine ship­ments. When the lat­est batch came, Dr Gayles’ team scram­bled to con­tact el­i­gi­ble peo­ple and to set up clin­ics to ad­min­is­ter the doses as fast as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Hes­i­tancy among peo­ple of­fered the vac­cine may also be slow­ing the roll-out. Ohio’s Gover­nor Mike DeWine said that around 60 per cent of nurs­ing home staff mem­bers in the state of­fered the vac­cine had de­clined it.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed of­fi­cials said they ex­pect the pace of the roll-out to ac­cel­er­ate sig­nif­i­cantly once phar­ma­cies be­gin of­fer­ing vac­cines in their stores. So far, 40,000 phar­macy lo­ca­tions have en­rolled in that pro­gramme with the govern­ment.</p>
