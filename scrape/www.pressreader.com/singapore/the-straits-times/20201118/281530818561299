    <p>Ja­pan Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said yes­ter­day that Ja­pan and Aus­tralia had reached a broad agree­ment on their de­fence pact to fa­cil­i­tate more joint op­er­a­tions and ex­er­cises on each other’s soil. The pact was an­nounced dur­ing a news con­fer­ence with Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son, who is vis­it­ing Tokyo.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said yes­ter­day that his coun­try and Aus­tralia have reached a broad agree­ment on their bi­lat­eral de­fence pact to fa­cil­i­tate more joint op­er­a­tions and ex­er­cises on each other’s soil.</p>
    <p>The moves fur­ther strengthen de­fence ties be­tween the two United States al­lies, at a time when China is as­sert­ing its role in the re­gion and the US is go­ing through a lead­er­ship tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The pact, called the Re­cip­ro­cal Ac­cess Agree­ment, is a le­gal frame­work to al­low their troops to visit each other’s coun­try and con­duct train­ing and joint op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga made the com­ments dur­ing a joint news con­fer­ence with Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son, who is vis­it­ing Tokyo.</p>
    <p>It will be Ja­pan’s first agree­ment cov­er­ing for­eign mil­i­tary pres­ence on its ter­ri­tory since it signed a Sta­tus of Forces Agree­ment in 1960 that al­lowed the US to base war­ships, fighter jets and thou­sands of troops in and around Ja­pan as part of a mil­i­tary al­liance that Wash­ing­ton has de­scribed as the bedrock of re­gional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The coun­tries have been ne­go­ti­at­ing the de­fence deal for six years, and that agree­ment still needs to be rat­i­fied by law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>The Suga-Mor­ri­son meet­ing came just weeks af­ter for­eign min­is­ters of the Quad al­liance, which also in­cludes the US and In­dia, met in the Ja­panese cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“A closer se­cu­rity ar­range­ment is on the cards in Tokyo in a bid to mit­i­gate the risks of a more ad­ven­tur­ous China,” said for­mer in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cer John Blax­land, who is now a pro­fes­sor at the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity, be­fore the meet­ing be­tween the two prime min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>“There is a clear over­lap of in­ter­ests when it comes to man­ag­ing mar­itime se­cu­rity, but Aus­tralia will still be mind­ful it may be seen as lead­ing at­tempts to gang up against Bei­jing,” Pro­fes­sor Blax­land said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son told re­porters last week that he viewed the Quad as “very im­por­tant”.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment will view the meet­ing with “cau­tious eyes and slight ner­vous­ness”, said ad­junct pro­fes­sor Yoshikazu Kato of the Asia Global In­sti­tute at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The re­newed im­pe­tus of the Quad since 2017, when it was re­vived in an at­tempt to create a buf­fer against Bei­jing, is a sym­bol that democ­ra­cies are will­ing to be­come “un­prece­dent­edly united in their stance to con­tain China – it’s of the ut­most con­cern” to Bei­jing, he said.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, Aus­tralia has ramped up di­plo­matic lob­by­ing to strengthen al­liances with other democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>Still, Aus­tralia’s move to take a lead­ing role in the Quad, along with other mul­ti­lat­eral groups like the Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence shar­ing al­liance, may lead to fur­ther pun­ish­ment from Bei­jing that could ex­ac­er­bate the coun­try’s rep­u­ta­tion as China’s new whip­ping boy.</p>
    <p>While ten­sions had been grow­ing for years, Aus­tralia tipped its relationsh­ip with its largest trad­ing part­ner to a new nadir in April by lead­ing in­ter­na­tional calls for in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tors to en­ter Wuhan to probe the ori­gin of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
