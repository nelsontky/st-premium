    <p>TAIPEI • A restau­rant in Xi­a­men, China, is in hot wa­ter fol­low­ing a law­suit by Tai­wanese pop star Jay Chou.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese me­dia out­lets, J Hero Chi­nese Cui­sine is pop­u­lar among fans of the 41-year-old singer-song­writer, many of whom be­lieve it is owned by him. After all, the restau­rant is a trea­sure trove of Jay Chou mem­o­ra­bilia, in­clud­ing pic­tures of him on the menu, wall de­cals and a standee.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the restau­rant had al­legedly not ob­tained the singer’s per­mis­sion to use his name and face.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, an at­tor­ney rep­re­sent­ing Chou is­sued a let­ter to the restau­rant, in­form­ing it of the copyright in­fringe­ment. J Hero made the rec­ti­fi­ca­tions and Chou’s le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tives con­tacted it in April that year to thank the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in De­cem­ber, the restau­rant was sued by Chou’s le­gal team. It was or­dered to cease and de­sist, apol­o­gise to the singer and pay 500,000 yuan (S$99,000) as repa­ra­tions. The case is still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment re­leased on Weibo on Wed­nes­day, J Hero main­tained that it had ob­tained the rights to use Chou’s im­ages.</p>
    <p>It shared a video of the singer at­tend­ing the open­ing cer­e­mony of the restau­rant’s first out­let in 2015, an au­tho­ri­sa­tion cer­tifi­cate from his stu­dio as well as an­other video of him con­grat­u­lat­ing the open­ing of an­other out­let in 2017.</p>
