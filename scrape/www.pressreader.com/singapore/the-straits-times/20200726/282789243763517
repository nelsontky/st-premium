    <p>Some com­pa­nies had to make rad­i­cal changes af­ter Covid-19 broke out in Sin­ga­pore in or­der to al­low staff to work from home.</p>
    <p>Cur­tains and blinds re­tailer mc.2, for in­stance, quickly put to­gether new prod­uct demon­stra­tion videos to help its sales staff con­duct con­sul­ta­tions with clients via video calls rather than at the show­room.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers that al­ready had some ex­pe­ri­ence with re­mote work­ing had to scale up their sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, which em­ploys about 10,000 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore, boosted its vir­tual pri­vate net­work ca­pac­ity by 11 times, said Ms Char­lotte Thng, its head of hu­man re­sources for Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia and the Asean and South Asia clus­ter mar­kets.</p>
    <p>It also pro­vided staff with up to US$100 (S$138) each so that they could buy ex­tra IT ac­ces­sories, such as mon­i­tors and key­boards, to boost pro­duc­tiv­ity at home.</p>
    <p>Now, even as com­pa­nies en­sure staff can re­turn to the work­place safely as the econ­omy re­opens in phases, re­mote work­ing looks set to be a big part of work­ing life.</p>
    <p>Firms and ob­servers say some prac­tices, such as greater flex­i­bil­ity for telecom­mut­ing and more ef­fi­cient meet­ings, are here to stay.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute (SHRI) pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem said not need­ing to “ap­ply” to telecom­mute is some­thing that will re­main in the new nor­mal, along with good meet­ing habits such as be­ing con­cise, send­ing in ma­te­ri­als to pre-read and us­ing tech­nol­ogy to en­gage with par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Ms Jane Lim, as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive for sec­toral trans­for­ma­tion at the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, said at a re­cent vir­tual di­a­logue or­gan­ised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy that the jury is still out on what the op­ti­mal blend of face-to-face and re­mote work­ing is. “We’re not go­ing to go back to pre-Covid, nor do I think will it be ab­so­lutely pos­si­ble to do com­pletely re­mote all the time.”</p>
    <p>As or­gan­i­sa­tions hire, es­tab­lish­ing com­pany cul­ture and norms may re­quire some face-to-face in­ter­ac­tion. “I sus­pect a lot of what we’re draw­ing down now is the so­cial cap­i­tal that was forged and the re­la­tion­ships that were es­tab­lished when we were all do­ing face to face,” Ms Lim said.</p>
    <p>Some global firms have al­ready com­mit­ted to mak­ing work from home a per­ma­nent op­tion for staff. Ear­lier this month, Fu­jitsu said it will halve its of­fice space in Ja­pan by the end of fis­cal year 2022, en­cour­ag­ing 80,000 of­fice work­ers to pri­mar­ily work re­motely. It will switch com­pletely to a hot de­sk­ing sys­tem and im­prove in­fra­struc­ture at satel­lite of­fices.</p>
    <p>In May, Twit­ter said that if em­ploy­ees are in a role and sit­u­a­tion that enable them to work from home and they want to con­tinue to do this, they may.</p>
    <p>Face­book also said that month that it ex­pects as many as half of its over 48,000 staff to be work­ing re­motely within a decade. But they may need to take a pay cut based on lower costs of liv­ing in some cases.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing has said there is high po­ten­tial for more peo­ple here to work from home reg­u­larly, as 57 per cent of the jobs in Sin­ga­pore are done by pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>A re­port re­leased in May by con­sul­tancy Eden Strat­egy In­sti­tute iden­ti­fied 11 job groups, out of the 30 ma­jor ones here, that score high in “tele­work­a­bil­ity”. This means dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and au­to­ma­tion tech enable the work to be per­formed re­motely in the near fu­ture. These jobs em­ploy around 336,000 res­i­dent work­ers, such as cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cers and qual­ity check­ers.</p>
    <p>As firms gear up for new ways of work­ing, tech use is be­com­ing more im­por­tant. Ac­cen­ture South­east Asia mar­ket unit lead Teo Lay Lim said: “From a tech­nol­ogy per­spec­tive, the pan­demic is con­sol­i­dat­ing 10 years of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts into six months.”</p>
    <p>The work-from-home trend is also chang­ing of­fice de­sign.</p>
    <p>“A lot of com­pa­nies are re­view­ing their lease agree­ments to po­ten­tially shrink of­fice sizes, as more look to set up hy­brid work ar­range­ments,” said In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als (IHRP) chief ex­ec­u­tive Mayank Parekh.</p>
    <p>De­sign firm Unis­pace said it has started us­ing a new de­sign prin­ci­ple it calls the pro­pel­ler frame­work, where of­fices fo­cus less on the in­di­vid­ual desk and hav­ing space to con­cen­trate, which work­ers can achieve at home. In­stead, space for col­lab­o­ra­tive prob­lem-solv­ing and in­no­va­tion, as well as com­mu­nity build­ing, will be pro­vided.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ees will con­tinue to split their time be­tween home and the of­fice, as they will still re­quire the emo­tional, psy­cho­log­i­cal and pro­fes­sional ben­e­fits of tightly wo­ven teams and a strong cor­po­rate cul­ture found in the work­place,” said Mr Toby Rak­i­son, Unis­pace’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Asia.</p>
    <p>PROS AND CONS</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say the ben­e­fits of telecom­mut­ing in­clude less load on the pub­lic trans­port sys­tem, time and ex­penses saved on com­mut­ing, and more fam­ily time.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice has also be­come more con­ve­nient in some ways. A spokesman for the Pub­lic Ser­vice Di­vi­sion said that since the cir­cuit breaker, many gov­ern­ment agen­cies have de­liv­ered cit­i­zen ser­vices dig­i­tally to re­duce the need for peo­ple to visit ser­vice cen­tres, and it will be boost­ing video­con­fer­enc­ing as a mode of ser­vice de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Still, re­mote work­ing is not with­out its chal­lenges for em­ploy­ers and work­ers. Mr Gary Khoo, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of eye­wear re­tailer Spec­ta­cle Hut, said it is hard for his non-re­tail staff, such as those in ac­counts and mar­ket­ing, to work from home be­cause some sys­tems can be ac­cessed only in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>SHRI’s Ms Low said there tends to be no clear sep­a­ra­tion be­tween work and rest, so many peo­ple tend to over­work. Their men­tal well-be­ing may also suf­fer if they are de­prived of so­cial in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Young par­ents may have to man­age work while look­ing af­ter chil­dren, with work­ing moth­ers tend­ing to take on the ad­di­tional load of car­ing for fam­ily needs, such as meals and chores, she said.</p>
    <p>A re­search re­port by em­ployee en­gage­ment plat­form En­gageRocket in col­lab­o­ra­tion with SHRI and IHRP, based on data col­lected from April to June, re­vealed that 40 per cent of work­ing par­ents found their stress lev­els un­ac­cept­able, dou­ble the pro­por­tion among all re­spon­dents. The top two chal­lenges they faced were work­ing longer hours than usual and deal­ing with prac­ti­cal as­pects, such as fam­ily pres­ence and space con­straints.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, the of­fice is not go­ing away en­tirely de­spite the ad­van­tages of work­ing from home. Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Sim Gim Guan said: “What­ever the changes may be, a work­place should con­tinue not just as a place to work but also a place where em­ploy­ees feel that they be­long.”</p>
