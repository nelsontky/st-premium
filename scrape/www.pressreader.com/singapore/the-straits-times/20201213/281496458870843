    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has warned that Christ­mas cel­e­bra­tions could turn into tears if peo­ple fail to keep up their guard against Covid-19 dur­ing the fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said on Fri­day the num­ber of deaths in the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was surg­ing and he urged peo­ple to think very care­fully about their hol­i­day sea­son plans.</p>
    <p>His warn­ing came as the United States said it has au­tho­rised the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine, with the first in­oc­u­la­tions ex­pected within days, mark­ing a turn­ing point in a coun­try where the pan­demic has killed more than 295,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The fes­tive sea­son is a time to re­lax and cel­e­brate but... cel­e­bra­tion can very quickly turn to sad­ness if we fail to take the right pre­cau­tions,” he told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“As you pre­pare to cel­e­brate over the com­ing weeks, please, please con­sider your plans care­fully. If you live in an area with high trans­mis­sion, please take ev­ery pre­cau­tion to keep your­selves and oth­ers safe.”</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said there had been a 60 per cent in­crease world­wide in deaths from the res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease over the past six weeks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some con­ti­nents are wit­ness­ing big­ger death toll surges than oth­ers, said WHO’s tech­ni­cal lead on Covid-19 Maria Van Kerkhove.</p>
    <p>She said there had been nearly a 100 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of deaths per week in the WHO’s Europe re­gion over the past six weeks, a 54 per cent in­crease in the Amer­i­cas and 50 per cent in Africa.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, WHO’s emer­gen­cies di­rec­tor Michael Ryan said the virus was yet to set­tle down into a pre­dictable pat­tern.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion glob­ally is still very epi­demi­o­log­i­cally un­sta­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the US, the health au­thor­i­ties, ship­ping ser­vices, hos­pi­tals and phar­ma­cies have been ready­ing a na­tion­wide in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said it would start ship­ping im­me­di­ately and state pub­lic health sys­tems have been plan­ning to be­gin shots as early as to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers and el­derly peo­ple in long-term care fa­cil­i­ties are ex­pected to be the main re­cip­i­ents of a first round of 2.9 mil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Bri­tain last week started rolling out pub­lic vac­ci­na­tions against the coro­n­avirus, Dr Te­dros said the pro­duc­tion of safe and ef­fec­tive jabs against a dis­ease that was com­pletely un­known a year ago was an “as­tound­ing sci­en­tific achieve­ment”.</p>
    <p>He said that al­most one bil­lion doses of three vac­cine can­di­dates had been se­cured as part of the Co­vax fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The WHO-led scheme for pool­ing risk and re­ward among coun­tries rich and poor is a global at­tempt to speed up the devel­op­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines, and pur­chase and dis­trib­ute them evenly re­gard­less of wealth.</p>
    <p>Some 189 coun­tries and economies are on board with the scheme, which aims to se­cure vac­cines for 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in each coun­try by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther deals will be an­nounced in the near fu­ture,” Dr Te­dros said.</p>
    <p>Look­ing for­ward to next year, WHO se­nior ad­viser Bruce Ayl­ward said there was light at the end of the “long tun­nel”.</p>
    <p>“There is no rea­son for us to see the same epi­demic next year be­cause we know how to beat this dis­ease,” he said.</p>
    <p>TAK­ING PRE­CAU­TIONS</p>
    <p>The fes­tive sea­son is a time to re­lax and cel­e­brate but... cel­e­bra­tion can very quickly turn to sad­ness if we fail to take the right pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>WHO CHIEF TE­DROS AD­HANOM GHE­BREYE­SUS, on the need for peo­ple to keep up their guard.</p>
    <p>BER­LIN/WASH­ING­TON • As the United States and Mex­ico be­came the lat­est coun­tries to au­tho­rise the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Ger­many’s BioNTech said the big­gest chal­lenge fac­ing the com­pany and its part­ner Pfizer is to scale up man­u­fac­tur­ing to meet huge de­mand.</p>
    <p>“We need to solve the man­u­fac­tur­ing chal­lenge,” Dr Ugur Sahin told Reuters in an in­ter­view. “It is very clear that more doses are needed. And we are deal­ing with that ques­tion – how to pro­duce more doses.”</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies have said they will pro­duce up to 1.3 bil­lion doses of the vac­cine next year.</p>
    <p>The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) on Fri­day au­tho­rised the vac­cine for emer­gency use, af­ter Bri­tain be­came the first coun­try to be­gin de­ploy­ing the shot out­side of clin­i­cal tri­als ear­lier in the week.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin said he ex­pects the com­pa­nies to re­ceive con­di­tional ap­proval from the Euro­pean Medicines Agency by the end of the month and can be­gin rolling out vac­cine in Euro­pean coun­tries early next year.</p>
    <p>One way he hopes to boost sup­ply would be by bring­ing on ear­lier than pro­jected the 750 mil­lion­dose-a-year plant BioNTech bought from No­var­tis in Mar­burg,</p>
    <p>Ger­many. BioNTech had said it would be­gin mak­ing the vac­cine there in the first half of 2021, and Dr Sahin said they are work­ing to get it up and run­ning on an ex­pe­dited time­line.</p>
    <p>“The base­line plan is 1.3 bil­lion doses,” he said. “And we are work­ing on an ex­tended plan. I can’t tell you at the mo­ment what is pos­si­ble and how much we can ex­pand the scale but we will try to do it sig­nif­i­cantly.”</p>
    <p>Sup­ply of the vac­cine will be lim­ited at first in the United States, which has a pop­u­la­tion of roughly 330 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The FDA said health­care work­ers and el­derly peo­ple in longterm care fa­cil­i­ties are ex­pected to be the main re­cip­i­ents of a first round of 2.9 mil­lion doses this month.</p>
    <p>The US health au­thor­i­ties, ship­ping ser­vices, hos­pi­tals and phar­ma­cies have been ready­ing a na­tion­wide in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said it would start ship­ping im­me­di­ately and state pub­lic health sys­tems have been plan­ning to be­gin shots as early as to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment plans to ac­cel­er­ate vac­ci­na­tions in the com­ing weeks and months, es­pe­cially if a sec­ond vac­cine from Moderna is quickly ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The US has or­dered 100 mil­lion doses of the two-dose vac­cine and could ne­go­ti­ate for more.</p>
    <p>Mex­ico, Bahrain and Saudi Ara­bia have also ap­proved the Pfizer vac­cine. Mex­ico had pro­cured 34.4 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer vac­cines, with the first batch ex­pected to ar­rive this month. The coun­try has the world’s fourth largest caseload with more than 113,000 deaths and 1.22 mil­lion cases as of Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said it would be­gin in­oc­u­lat­ing its pop­u­la­tion at the end of the month, with pri­or­ity given to front­line med­i­cal staff.</p>
    <p>In data re­leased this week, Pfizer and BioNTech said their vac­cine be­gan con­fer­ring some pro­tec­tion to re­cip­i­ents even be­fore they got the sec­ond shot. It seemed to be­gin to show some ef­fi­cacy around 12 days af­ter the first shot.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin said he was sur­prised by the data: “We know that the im­mune re­sponse is heav­ily boosted af­ter the sec­ond dose.”</p>
    <p>He said the com­pa­nies have not de­cided yet whether to eval­u­ate a sin­gle-dose ver­sion of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“This will be a dis­cus­sion that we will cer­tainly have with our part­ners Pfizer,” he said.</p>
