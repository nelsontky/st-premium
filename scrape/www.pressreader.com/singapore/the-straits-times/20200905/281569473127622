    <p>Re­searchers have de­vel­oped a co­her­ent map of genes in the heart and looked at how they may cause heart diseases, which could pave the way for new treat­ments. Heart diseases are a com­plex set of diseases in­flu­enced by dif­fer­ent genes, and it is chal­leng­ing to un­der­stand which genes are re­spon­si­ble for a par­tic­u­lar dis­ease, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers have de­vel­oped a co­her­ent map of genes in the heart and looked at how they may cause heart diseases, which could pave the way for new treat­ments for these ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>Heart diseases are a com­plex set of diseases in­flu­enced by dif­fer­ent genes, and it is chal­leng­ing to un­der­stand which genes are re­spon­si­ble for a par­tic­u­lar dis­ease, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>To help sci­en­tists un­ravel the com­plex web of genes and how they in­ter­act, re­searchers from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (NUS Medicine) and the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal cre­ated what they said is the first map of the heart’s genes and the “switches” be­tween them that con­trol how the genes be­have and con­trib­ute to heart diseases.</p>
    <p>Genes code for spe­cific traits, and the switches are the non-cod­ing por­tions of DNA be­tween the genes.</p>
    <p>Each gene has more than one switch and the switches may be far away from the genes that they con­trol, mak­ing it tricky for sci­en­tists to match the switches to the genes.</p>
    <p>The ge­netic heart map lo­cates the genes and their switches so that sci­en­tists can even­tu­ally study them to cre­ate tar­geted treat­ments, such as gene ther­apy.</p>
    <p>“If we un­der­stand how these genes are con­trolled, then we may find ways to con­trol heart fail­ure it­self... and iden­tify new dis­ease-caus­ing genes,” said Pro­fes­sor Roger Foo from the univer­sity’s depart­ment of medicine, who led the re­search team.</p>
    <p>Heart diseases, which even­tu­ally lead to heart fail­ure, cause one-third of all deaths in Sin­ga­pore an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers are part of the Car­dio­vas­cu­lar Dis­ease Trans­la­tional Re­search Pro­gramme, one of nine new strate­gic re­search fo­cus ar­eas that were es­tab­lished at NUS Medicine in July.</p>
    <p>The new fo­cus ar­eas, which also in­clude in­fec­tious diseases, healthy longevity and pre­ci­sion medicine, aim to cre­ate greater syn­ergy and col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween ba­sic and clin­i­cal sci­en­tists within the Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem, and to de­liver re­search out­comes that ad­dress cur­rent clin­i­cal and na­tional health­care is­sues.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chng Wee Joo, vicedean of re­search at NUS Medicine, said: “We hope that these nine pro­grammes will de­liver not just out­stand­ing re­search, but over the next five to 10 years, make some real im­pact on how we treat our pa­tients and on the pop­u­la­tion’s health.”</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment of the gene map was pub­lished as two com­pan­ion pub­li­ca­tions in the jour­nals Cir­cu­la­tion Re­search and Cir­cu­la­tion last month and this month re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The map took about five years to de­velop, and the re­searchers stud­ied tis­sues from 36 healthy hearts and 34 fail­ing hearts to map out the genes and switches.</p>
    <p>If we un­der­stand how these genes are con­trolled, then we may find ways to con­trol heart fail­ure it­self... and iden­tify new dis­ease-caus­ing genes.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR ROGER FOO, from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s depart­ment of medicine, who led the team that de­vel­oped the map of genes in the heart.</p>
    <p>Prof Foo said some sci­en­tists from Sin­ga­pore and abroad have reached out to them to find out more about var­i­ous genes from the map.</p>
    <p>He also noted that none of the drugs cur­rently used in treat­ing heart dis­ease tar­gets genes, and car­dio­vas­cu­lar re­search is not as well funded com­pared with other health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“The place where a lot of gene tar­get­ing is hap­pen­ing, I feel, is in cancer. Look­ing at the progress that cancer treat­ment has seen in re­cent years with tar­geted ther­apy, this is our dream for car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease also, now that we have mapped out all these spe­cific pro­cesses,” he added.</p>
