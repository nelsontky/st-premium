    <p>My orchids were grow­ing well, but the leaves were at­tacked by a pest (left). The pots are placed on a high metal rack and get direct sun for half a day. There are squir­rels and snails in my gar­den.</p>
    <p>Sin Chey Cheng</p>
    <p>It ap­pears that your orchid leaves have been eaten by snails or slugs.</p>
    <p>You may want to check the pot­ting me­dia for the pests as they tend to hide in dark and moist places in the day. Hang­ing up your pot­ted orchids can de­ter ac­cess by these pests.</p>
    <p>You can also check for their pres­ence at night, es­pe­cially af­ter wet weather, and re­move the pests seen on your plant.</p>
    <p>Putting snail and slug poi­son bait pel­lets may help re­duce their pop­u­la­tion, but keep them out of reach of young chil­dren and pets.</p>
