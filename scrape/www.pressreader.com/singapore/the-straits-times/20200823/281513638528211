    <p>Ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist – and fa­ther of eight – Finian Tan hopes the fruits of his in­vest­ments in med­i­cal re­search and tech­nol­ogy will reach those who may not be able to af­ford them.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing the less priv­i­leged with ac­cess to med­i­cal ad­vance­ments is some­thing he in­tends to do with his foun­da­tion, which he started with his wife in 2018.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, 58, founder of Vick­ers Ven­ture Part­ners, says that a lot of his port­fo­lio com­pa­nies work on find­ing cures and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>He worked at Shell and Gold­man Sachs as well as in the pub­lic sec­tor be­fore start­ing Vick­ers in 2004 with pri­mar­ily his own cap­i­tal and in­vest­ments from some former col­leagues.</p>
    <p>He and his wife Fiona Goh, 40, have quadru­plets who are un­der one year old – three with the help of sur­ro­gates.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan’s four older sons are aged be­tween 18 and 32, with two cur­rently do­ing their na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Vick­ers fo­cuses on deep tech firms around the world. One of the port­fo­lio com­pa­nies he is most ex­cited about is Awak Tech­nolo­gies, a Sin­ga­pore firm that in­vented a dial­y­sis ma­chine which weighs around 2kg and can be car­ried in a hand­bag.</p>
    <p>On the cur­rent eco­nomic land­scape given the virus pan­demic, he says the scale of the im­pact of Covid-19 has been hid­den so far be­cause of gov­ern­ment aid, which is not sus­tain­able for most coun­tries.</p>
    <p>While he is con­fi­dent an ef­fec­tive vac­cine will even­tu­ally be found, he feels stock mar­kets are cur­rently priced as if the vac­cine will def­i­nitely be found soon, and sup­ply for the world avail­able im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>This, he says, “is rather bullish in my view as the risk pre­mium has not been prop­erly priced in”.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, deep-tech ven­ture in­vest­ing is not ex­posed to mar­ket risks but rather whether the break­through tech­nol­ogy works.</p>
    <p>But, he ac­knowl­edges, his firm is not al­ways right. “Our write-off rate is about 6 per cent, but when we are right, we are able to achieve mul­ti­ples that are al­most never seen in more ma­ture mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who holds a PhD in engi­neer­ing, says most of his wealth will be do­nated to char­ity and go to­wards the un­der­priv­i­leged.</p>
    <p>Asked what money means to him, he says: “The more I can earn, the bet­ter, be­cause there are so many un­der­priv­i­leged peo­ple in this world that I can never earn enough to help.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A Al­most all my net worth is tied up with Vick­ers, other than the prop­er­ties that I live in here in Sin­ga­pore and in Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>While it means I am ex­posed to just one as­set class, my ex­po­sure within Vick­ers is also well di­ver­si­fied across over 50 com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Since 2012, we have mor­phed into a deep-tech ven­ture firm, with most of our later in­vest­ments in break­through tech­nolo­gies across the globe, rang­ing from life science, nan­otech­nol­ogy, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, clean en­ergy to fin­tech.</p>
    <p>We have achieved an an­nual net re­turn – in­ter­nal rate of re­turn (IRR) – of 25 per cent over the last 15 years, with the high­est IRRs com­ing from our later funds.</p>
    <p>But ven­ture cap­i­tal re­turns are nor­mally mea­sured on mul­ti­ples. Our two lat­est funds have pro­jec­tions of a net re­turn of over 10 times at the end of life, which is typ­i­cally 12 years.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A We have seen good suc­cess with our cur­rent strat­egy of in­vest­ing in break­through tech­nolo­gies across the globe. We are cur­rently ranked in the top 10 most con­sis­tent high per­form­ing man­agers in the world and as­pire to climb fur­ther up the ranks in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A We don’t like risk. I know this sounds like a mis­nomer since ven­ture cap­i­tal (VC) is of­ten per­ceived as a risky as­set class.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in­vest­ing with a top quar­tile VC fund is one of the low­est risks in the in­dus­try due to the halo ef­fect – the best deals go to the best VCs.</p>
    <p>(This cre­ates) a vir­tu­ous cy­cle re­sult­ing in the most per­sis­tent per­cent­age of all as­set classes, mean­ing a top quar­tile VC has a higher chance of stay­ing in the top quar­tile com­pared to other as­set classes.</p>
    <p>For us, we take risks on the tech­nolo­gies that com­pa­nies are de­vel­op­ing. For ex­am­ple, if we pick a com­pany that is try­ing to cure can­cer, there will be de­mand for the drug re­gard­less of mar­kets. Even in a pan­demic, peo­ple still suf­fer from can­cer and will need the drug.</p>
    <p>The risk we take is whether we are right with our view of the science, and whether the drug is ap­proved. As a re­sult, our write-off rate is less than 6 per cent, which com­pares very well with the in­dus­try aver­age of over 60 per cent write-offs.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan? A I have told my chil­dren that a ma­jor­ity of our wealth will be given to char­ity. The rest will re­main in our fam­ily of­fice for those in­clined to man­age.</p>
    <p>We have drafted a fam­ily con­sti­tu­tion which takes care of the man­age­ment of both the fam­ily of­fice and the foun­da­tion, which re­quires a su­per-ma­jor­ity to change. The first sen­tence in the fam­ily con­sti­tu­tion says, “to whom much is given, much is re­quired”.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I have told my in­vestors that I in­tend to step back from day-to-day man­age­ment of Vick­ers when I turn 70, which is 12 years from now, be­cause I hope to fo­cus more on our foun­da­tion, which my wife Fiona and I started in 2018 when we pledged the first mil­lion in the foun­da­tion to the Wild Rice Theatre in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>We sub­se­quently ex­panded our giv­ing to the Mu­si­cal Fac­tory in New York and to Ac­tions for Dolphins in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Next year we hope to fund an or­gan­i­sa­tion called Char­ity Water, which brings clean water to over six hun­dred mil­lion peo­ple in the world with no ac­cess to fresh clean water. I ex­pect to be work­ing on the ground in Africa and In­dia as the foun­da­tion kicks into higher gear when I re­tire from ac­tive fund man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My fa­ther was a trained ac­coun­tant who worked in the pub­lic sec­tor be­fore be­com­ing a part­ner in a stock­broking firm.</p>
    <p>In the 1985 Pan-Elec­tric cri­sis, the com­pany went bank­rupt and so we had to move from our bun­ga­low near the sea to a Hous­ing Board flat in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>By then I was about to grad­u­ate and had won a schol­ar­ship for my fi­nal year as an un­der­grad at Glas­gow Univer­sity. I went to Cam­bridge Univer­sity later, on schol­ar­ships from Shell and Christ Col­lege, so I be­came fi­nan­cially in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>I still have many fond mem­o­ries grow­ing up by the sea and that’s why I love liv­ing in Sen­tosa so much.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A In Sin­ga­pore, we live in Sen­tosa with about 10,000 sq ft of built-up space in to­tal.</p>
    <p>My house is full of lit­tle chil­dren at the mo­ment so I of­ten have my meet­ings on my cata­ma­ran, which is moored down­stairs at One15 Ma­rina Sen­tosa Cove.</p>
    <p>Our Los An­ge­les home has about 7,000 sq ft of space. We are in the process of build­ing a larger house in LA which will com­fort­ably fit the grow­ing fam­ily. We man­aged to find a really nice 18-acre (7.3 hectares) plot in Bev­erly Hills just a 12-minute drive away from Rodeo Drive, so we de­cided to build our fam­ily home there.</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A I like cars and I en­joy col­lect­ing them. But ever since we started the foun­da­tion, I’ve made it a point to pledge an equal amount to the foun­da­tion every time I in­dulge in in­creas­ing my col­lec­tion.</p>
