    <p>Hong Kong’s Bar As­so­ci­a­tion has said that the gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to post­pone the Sept 6 leg­isla­tive elec­tion by a year, by in­vok­ing emer­gency leg­is­la­tion af­ter a spike in Covid-19 cases, may be un­law­ful. WORLD</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to post­pone an elec­tion for the city’s leg­is­la­ture by a year, by in­vok­ing emer­gency leg­is­la­tion af­ter a spike in coro­n­avirus cases, may be un­law­ful, the city’s bar as­so­ci­a­tion said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam last Fri­day post­poned the polls for the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil, or Legco, cit­ing pub­lic health dan­gers, but said there were po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion would have been the for­mer Bri­tish colony’s first of­fi­cial vote since Bei­jing im­posed a na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong to tackle what China broadly de­fines as se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces, with pun­ish­ment of up to life in pri­son.</p>
    <p>Elec­toral rules in Hong Kong only al­low votes to be post­poned for 14 days, but colo­nial-era laws give the gov­ern­ment broad pow­ers in case of threats to pub­lic safety.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Sun­day, the Hong Kong Bar As­so­ci­a­tion said the elec­toral law was more re­cent and more spe­cific when it comes to pub­lic health haz­ards at elec­tion time and “gen­er­ally” should take prece­dence over older leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In­vok­ing emer­gency leg­is­la­tion to de­lay the sched­uled vote “may turn out to be un­law­ful”, it said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the com­ments by the bar as­so­ci­a­tion, a Hong Kong gov­ern­ment spokesman said yes­ter­day that post­pon­ing the elec­tion for 14 days is not a prac­ti­cal so­lu­tion to this un­prece­dented prob­lem.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions would likely last for at least sev­eral weeks or longer, the spokesman added, not­ing that there may also be a win­ter surge later in the year.</p>
    <p>“If the power to post­pone the elec­tion for 14 days is re­peat­edly in­voked, it will likely be re­garded as a mis­use of power sub­ject to le­gal chal­lenge. On top of that, it will cre­ate highly un­de­sir­able uncer­tain­ties for all par­ties con­cerned,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>On in­vok­ing the Emer­gency Reg­u­la­tions Or­di­nance to post­pone the elec­tion, the spokesman stressed that it was the only vi­able op­tion.</p>
    <p>“The le­gal ba­sis is sound, as the present epi­demic sit­u­a­tion can be re­garded as an oc­ca­sion of pub­lic dan­ger and emer­gency, and the de­ci­sion to post­pone is in the pub­lic in­ter­est,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The State Coun­cil, or China’s Cab­i­net, has also ex­pressed sup­port for the de­ci­sion to post­pone the elec­tion and un­der­took “to make a sub­mis­sion in ac­cor­dance with the law to the Stand­ing Com­mit­tee of the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress for its de­ci­sion”, the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam had said ear­lier that the gov­ern­ment was seek­ing help from the Chi­nese Par­lia­ment’s top de­ci­sion mak­ing body to re­solve the leg­isla­tive vac­uum cre­ated by the ex­pir­ing man­date of the Legco.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang Xiaom­ing, ex­ec­u­tive deputy di­rec­tor of the Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice of China’s Cab­i­net, was vis­it­ing Hong Kong to meet peo­ple and lis­ten to their views on the mat­ter, broad­caster RTHK re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The United States has con­demned the post­pone­ment of the elec­tion, with Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo say­ing it was likely that “Hong Kong will never again be able to vote – for any­thing or any­one”.</p>
