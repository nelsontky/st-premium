    <p>Many peo­ple are heed­less of the cor­rup­tion that ex­ists in squeaky clean Sin­ga­pore, but graft re­mains preva­lent.</p>
    <p>To get teenagers to be aware of cases of cor­rup­tion, Sin­ga­pore’s graft busters have launched an e-book ti­tled The Cor­rup­tion Case­book – Sto­ries From Un­der The Ta­ble.</p>
    <p>It is avail­able for down­load on the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau’s (CPIB) web­site at cpib.gov.sg.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the 16 cases from the e-book:</p>
    <p>PRE­VENT­ING THE BREED­ING OF COR­RUP­TION</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Tung Chee Keong and In­dian na­tional Chan­dran Je­ganathan were work­ing for Killem Pest, a con­trac­tor en­gaged by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA), when they agreed to alert a site man­ager about up­com­ing mos­quito breed­ing in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, Muthukarup­pan Periyasamy, con­struc­tion site man­ager at Fen­zhii Engi­neer­ing as well as Ramo In­dus­tries, paid them bribes.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that Tung and Chan­dran were work­ing as vec­tor con­trol work­ers in 2018.</p>
    <p>Their com­pany, Killem, was hired as a term con­trac­tor to help NEA of­fi­cers con­trol pests such as mos­qui­toes.</p>
    <p>As part of their work, both men fol­lowed NEA of­fi­cers on in­spec­tions at con­struc­tion sites to look for mos­quito breed­ing grounds.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Jan­uary and April 2018, mos­quito breed­ing grounds were found on two oc­ca­sions at a con­struc­tion site man­aged by Muthukarup­pan, an In­dian na­tional. He knew that if there was an­other vi­o­la­tion, a stop-work or­der would be im­posed.</p>
    <p>A cor­rupt ar­range­ment was then made where Muthukarup­pan of­fered Tung and Chan­dran a sum of $400 a month for ad­vance no­ti­fi­ca­tion of mos­quito breed­ing in­spec­tions at a con­struc­tion site he was over­see­ing. This ar­range­ment went on for four months, and the monies were split be­tween Tung and Chan­dran, with Tung re­ceiv­ing $1,000 and Chan­dran re­ceiv­ing $600.</p>
    <p>On March 18, 2019, Tung was sen­tenced to 11 weeks’ jail and Chan­dran was given a six-week term.</p>
    <p>On May 2 the same year, Muthukarup­pan was sen­tenced to six weeks’ jail for cor­ruptly giv­ing grat­i­fi­ca­tion of $1,600.</p>
    <p>$1 BRIBES ADD UP TO THOU­SANDS</p>
    <p>In 2018, two Chi­nese na­tion­als were charged over bribes of $1 – one of the low­est amounts in­volved in a cor­rup­tion case.</p>
    <p>Chen Zil­iang and Zhao Yu­cun reg­u­larly col­lected $1 bribes from truck driv­ers in ex­change for not de­lay­ing the load­ing and un­load­ing of ve­hi­cles. As fork­lift op­er­a­tors, their job was to load and un­load con­tain­ers onto and from trucks.</p>
    <p>Their cor­rupt prac­tice came to light when a truck driver com­plained to Chen after hav­ing to queue a long time. Chen told the driver it was the norm for truck driv­ers to pay $1, or risk hav­ing to wait longer in the queue or be given con­tain­ers that were in a bad con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Chen and Zhao, who were then both work­ing for Co­gent Con­tainer De­pot, took be­tween $7 and $10 daily from truck driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Fe­bru­ary 2016 and March 2018, Chen was es­ti­mated to have col­lected about $4,872.50 in bribes. Zhao was es­ti­mated to have taken $10,865.50 in bribes be­tween Septem­ber 2013 and March 2018.</p>
    <p>Chen was sen­tenced to two months in prison and or­dered to pay a penalty of $4,870.50 while Zhao was sen­tenced to four months in jail and or­dered to pay a penalty of $10,863.</p>
    <p>AT­TEMPTED BRIBERY TO GET AWAY WITH VICE</p>
    <p>Moldova na­tional Belousova Natalia was not on hol­i­day in Sin­ga­pore when the au­thor­i­ties ap­proached her at the Swis­so­tel The Stam­ford on April 11, 2017, over sus­pected in­volve­ment in vice ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>While be­ing ar­rested, Belousova of­fered “money and gifts” to three po­lice of­fi­cers in ex­change for her re­lease. She did this de­spite be­ing warned that it was an of­fence.</p>
    <p>The po­lice of­fi­cers did not ac­cept her of­fer.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, it is an of­fence to bribe, or at­tempt to bribe public of­fi­cers. Belousova was charged in court and sen­tenced on May 11, 2017, to four weeks’ jail for at­tempt­ing to bribe three of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>HEAVY PENALTY FOR FIX­ING ONE MATCH</p>
    <p>Ra­jen­dran R. Ku­rusamy was given the stiffest sen­tence ever im­posed for a sin­gle match-fix­ing charge after he tried to get the Ti­mor-Leste team to lose to Malaysia in a SEA Games match.</p>
    <p>Ra­jen­dran, a su­per­vi­sor at a con­struc­tion com­pany, had paid team man­ager Or­lando Mar­ques Hen­riques Men­des and at least seven play­ers of the Ti­mor-Leste SEA Games foot­ball team to throw a game. He wanted the team to not con­cede a goal in the first 20 min­utes but even­tu­ally play to lose to Malaysia by a few goals. He bribed Or­lando with $15,000 and each player with $4,000.</p>
    <p>But two days be­fore the match, Ra­jen­dran, Or­lando, In­done­sian Nasirud­din (for­mer ref­eree) and Moises Natal­ino de Je­sus (for­mer Ti­mor Leste player) were ar­rested by the CPIB.</p>
    <p>Malaysia went on to win the match 1-0.</p>
    <p>Ra­jen­dran was known to the au­thor­i­ties here. Public pros­e­cu­tors had de­scribed him as Sin­ga­pore’s most pro­lific match-fixer and “a crim­i­nal match-fixer ex­traor­di­naire”. He was in­volved in the fix­ing of at least eight foot­ball matches in the S-League.</p>
    <p>He was pre­vi­ously jailed for 18 months and fined $200,000 for try­ing to fix two S-League matches. Later, he was jailed for an­other nine months and fined $200,000 for try­ing to fix two other S-League matches.</p>
    <p>While serv­ing the sec­ond sen­tence, he bribed a prison war­den with $20,000 to smug­gle in a mo­bile phone, which he used to make foot­ball bets and phone calls.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived a 24-month jail sen­tence for this.</p>
    <p>For try­ing to fix the Malaysi­aTi­mor-Leste match, Ra­jen­dran was sen­tenced to four years’ jail.</p>
    <p>Nasirud­din was jailed for 30 months. Or­lando was sen­tenced to 24 months’ jail and had to pay a $1,000 penalty, while Moises was sen­tenced to 20 months’ jail.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, it is an of­fence to bribe, or at­tempt to bribe public of­fi­cers. Moldova na­tional Belousova Natalia was charged in court and sen­tenced on May 11, 2017, to four weeks’ jail for at­tempt­ing to bribe three of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Ra­jen­dran R. Ku­rusamy was known to the au­thor­i­ties here. Public pros­e­cu­tors had de­scribed him as Sin­ga­pore’s most pro­lific match-fixer and “a crim­i­nal match-fixer ex­traor­di­naire”. He was in­volved in the fix­ing of at least eight foot­ball matches in the S-League.</p>
