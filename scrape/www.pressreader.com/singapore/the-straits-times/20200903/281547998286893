    <p>A Ti­betan-ori­gin sol­dier with In­dia’s spe­cial forces was killed in the lat­est bor­der show­down with Chi­nese troops on their con­tested Hi­malayan bor­der, a Ti­betan rep­re­sen­ta­tive has said. The death is the first re­ported from two in­ci­dents in 48 hours on the bor­der, which has height­ened ten­sions between In­dia and China.</p>
    <p>NEW DELHI • A Ti­betan-ori­gin sol­dier with In­dia’s spe­cial forces was killed in the lat­est bor­der show­down with Chi­nese troops on their con­tested Hi­malayan bor­der, a Ti­betan rep­re­sen­ta­tive has said.</p>
    <p>The death is the first re­ported from two in­ci­dents in 48 hours on the bor­der, which has height­ened ten­sions between the giant na­tions just two months af­ter a bat­tle that left at least 20 In­dian soldiers dead.</p>
    <p>In­dia and China, which fought a bor­der war in 1962, have ac­cused each other of seek­ing to cross their un­of­fi­cial fron­tier in the Ladakh re­gion in a bid to gain ter­ri­tory on Satur­day, and then again on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther side has an­nounced any ca­su­al­ties but Ms Namghyal Dolkar Lhag­yari, a mem­ber of the Ti­betan Par­lia­ment in ex­ile, told AFP on Tues­day that the Ti­betan-ori­gin sol­dier was “mar­tyred dur­ing the clash” on Satur­day night.</p>
    <p>She said an­other mem­ber of the Spe­cial Fron­tier Force that re­port­edly in­cludes many eth­nic Ti­betans, who op­pose China’s claim to their home re­gion, was wounded in the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The world’s two most pop­u­lous coun­tries have sent tens of thou­sands of troops to the re­gion since a bru­tal June 15 bat­tle.</p>
    <p>In­dia has said 20 troops were killed. China ac­knowl­edged ca­su­al­ties, but did not give fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The two sides blamed each other for the lat­est in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>In­dian media re­ports, quot­ing mil­i­tary sources, said Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army forces from China tried to take hill­tops tra­di­tion­ally claimed by In­dia around Pan­gong Tso, a lake at an al­ti­tude of 4,200m.</p>
    <p>In­dia yes­ter­day banned 118 more Chi­nese apps in a stepped-up back­lash. The In­for­ma­tion Tech­nol­ogy Min­istry said the apps – in­clud­ing the mo­bile ver­sion of the pop­u­lar video game PUBG and other ser­vices pro­vided by Chi­nese In­ter­net giant Ten­cent – pro­moted ac­tiv­i­ties “prej­u­di­cial to sovereignt­y and in­tegrity of In­dia, de­fence of In­dia, se­cu­rity of state and pub­lic or­der”.</p>
    <p>The United States hopes for a peace­ful res­o­lu­tion to the clashes between In­dia and China on the dis­puted moun­tain bor­der, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a press con­fer­ence at the State De­part­ment, Mr Pom­peo also said Wash­ing­ton was call­ing on China to en­gage in talks with the Dalai Lama, the spir­i­tual leader of Ti­betan Bud­dhism.</p>
