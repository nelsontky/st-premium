    <p>Film-mak­ing in In­dia may have ground nearly to a halt amid the Covid-19 pan­demic – but celebri­ties are mak­ing the kind of head­lines they would not wish on their worst ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Sushant Singh Ra­jput’s pos­si­ble sui­cide on June 14 led to two months of fren­zied me­dia cov­er­age and the po­lice us­ing Bol­ly­wood ac­tors’ pri­vate What­sApp chats to al­lege wide­spread drug use in the film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The Nar­cotics Con­trol Bureau, In­dia’s apex drug law en­force­ment agency, has launched a drug probe. It ar­rested 20 peo­ple, in­clud­ing Ms Rhea Chakrabort­y, Mr Ra­jput’s ac­tress girl­friend.</p>
    <p>The nar­cotics agency has sum­moned 35 peo­ple for in­ter­ro­ga­tion. Top ac­tors Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shrad­dha Kapoor and Rakul Preet Singh, as well as fash­ion de­signer Si­mone Kham­batta, were ques­tioned for sev­eral hours on Sept 25 and 26.</p>
    <p>In­di­ans are watch­ing round the clock the high-en­ergy, low-ev­i­dence news about Bol­ly­wood’s “drug car­tels” – to quote TV an­chors. This cov­er­age has sparked liv­ing room dis­cus­sions about drug use in the glitzy in­dus­try that makes about 400 films a year.</p>
    <p>Things heated up in July when Mr Ra­jput’s par­ents filed a po­lice com­plaint ac­cus­ing Ms Chakrabort­y and her fam­ily of driv­ing the ac­tor to sui­cide. They also al­leged that she trans­ferred some of their son’s money to un­known ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The En­force­ment Di­rec­torate, which in­ves­ti­gates money laun­der­ing, reg­is­tered a case against Ms Chakrabort­y. It is yet to dis­cover a money trail, but did find some What­sApp chats al­legedly re­lated to mar­i­juana after mak­ing foren­sic clones of Ms Chakrabort­y’s phones.</p>
    <p>Those were given to the nar­cotics agency, which reg­is­tered a case against Ms Chakrabort­y and five oth­ers but no ar­rests were made. Then, fil­ing a sec­ond case to “up­root the drug citadel in Bol­ly­wood”, the agency ar­rested 19 peo­ple, in­clud­ing Ms Chakrabort­y and her brother.</p>
    <p>Since late last month, the nar­cotics agency has sum­moned many ac­tors based on What­sApp chats found on other peo­ple’s phones. None of the ac­tors sum­moned has been ac­cused of­fi­cially.</p>
    <p>Bol­ly­wood’s al­leged in­volve­ment with the crim­i­nal un­der­world and drug sup­pli­ers’ stran­gle­hold over film fund­ing are largely a thing of the past, many in­sid­ers say.</p>
    <p>Pro­ducer Sid­harth Jain of screen­writ­ing com­pany The Story Ink said that with the ar­rival of in­ter­na­tional pro­duc­tion stu­dios and pro­fes­sion­als with non-film back­grounds in the past decade, the in­dus­try is now more pro­fes­sional.</p>
    <p>Con­tracts have clauses pro­hibit­ing the use of drugs dur­ing shoots.</p>
    <p>Film critic Mayank Shekhar said: “Un­like what much of the me­dia is show­ing, this is not a Bol­ly­wood drug car­tel story. The word ‘car­tel’ points to sup­ply, not con­sump­tion. Un­less you can prove that peo­ple sup­ply drugs, how can you call it a Bol­ly­wood car­tel?”</p>
    <p>In­dia’s nar­cotics law crim­i­nalises the mak­ing, sale, pur­chase, pos­ses­sion and use of drugs in­clud­ing heroin, opium, mor­phine, co­caine and LSD. It also pun­ishes the con­sump­tion of the resin and the tops of the cannabis plant, but not its seeds and leaves, which have been tra­di­tion­ally con­sumed in In­dia – in an ed­i­ble prepa­ra­tion known as “bhang” – for thou­sands of years.</p>
    <p>In 2018, nearly 60 per cent of more than 81,000 drug-re­lated ar­rests na­tion­wide were over cases of pos­ses­sion for per­sonal use. The Vidhi Cen­tre for Le­gal Policy think­tank found that most of those ar­rested in Mum­bai that year were daily wage earn­ers.</p>
    <p>They were ap­pre­hended cannabis con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Mamta Kulka­rni is one of the few ac­tors be­ing in­ves­ti­gated along with her hus­band Vi­jay Goswami – who is now jailed in the United States – for be­ing in­volved in a global drug car­tel.</p>
    <p>A Mum­bai screen­writer, who did not want to be named, said: “Peo­ple do con­sume a fair amount of weed for and hash in the (film) in­dus­try but it is not enough to sup­port nar­coter­ror­ism. I know peers who en­gage in recre­ational drugs like MDMA and co­caine, but I also know many who ab­stain.”</p>
    <p>In the late 1970s, di­rec­tor and writer Ma­hesh Bhatt said he had used LSD after a tu­mul­tuous re­la­tion­ship with an ac­tress.</p>
    <p>Singer Yo Yo Honey Singh re­cently con­fessed to ad­dic­tion and said he was treated by his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Trou­bled film star San­jay Dutt, who was jailed for il­le­gal pos­ses­sion of weapons in con­nec­tion with the 1993 Mum­bai bomb­ings, had also ad­mit­ted to hav­ing tried “ev­ery drug that ex­isted” in the 1990s. He quit after re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and is now a vo­cal anti-drug cru­sader.</p>
    <p>In 2001, Mum­bai po­lice ar­rested emerg­ing ac­tor Fardeen Khan for at­tempt­ing to buy a gram of co­caine. The ac­tor did a detox­i­fi­ca­tion course and was granted bail with im­mu­nity in 2012.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Kan­gana Ra­naut, who is to­day the loud­est critic of nepo­tism and “star cul­ture”, has claimed that “99 per cent of Bol­ly­wood takes drugs”. But other film pro­fes­sion­als say that while drug con­sump­tion is preva­lent, it is not an in­dus­try-spe­cific prac­tice.</p>
    <p>“Who is in­ter­ested in in­dus­tri­al­ists and in­vest­ment bankers do­ing drugs? Drug sto­ries about fa­mous Bol­ly­wood peo­ple sell eas­ily, just like the ex­ag­ger­ated gos­sip of their af­fairs and ri­val­ries,” said Mr Jain.</p>
    <p>And as tele­vi­sion re­porters chase ac­tors in cars, cor­ner them in air­ports and camp out­side their homes, a new class of pa­parazzi has emerged in In­dia.</p>
    <p>“Did you use drugs, Deepika? Tell us!” shouted a Re­pub­lic Bharat re­porter from her taxi win­dow, as she chased Ms Padukone’s car in Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>The me­dia cov­er­age, many be­lieve, has fu­elled the in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Some ac­tors have asked why Ms Chakrabort­y was ar­rested and de­nied bail, even though she was not found in pos­ses­sion of any drugs.</p>
    <p>“This back­lash is why many of us are quiet, wor­ry­ing who is next. But we are fu­ri­ous,” said a young ac­tor who did not wish to be named.</p>
    <p>Mr Shekhar is wor­ried that the “smear cam­paign” could af­fect fe­male pro­fes­sion­als and tal­ented peo­ple en­ter­ing the film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple al­ready fight against stigma when telling their fam­i­lies they are en­ter­ing the world of cin­ema or when look­ing for apart­ments in Mum­bai. Show­ing the in­dus­try as a drug den will just deepen pre­con­ceived no­tions about it,” said Mr Shekhar.</p>
