    <p>In March, Mr Muham­mad Khalid Azmi had been a trainee air­craft tech­ni­cian at Sin­ga­pore Aero En­gine Ser­vices for a few months when the Covid-19 pan­demic led to a dras­tic plunge in de­mand for air travel.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, I was wor­ried be­cause I thought that in this sit­u­a­tion, the new staff would be re­trenched first,” said the 25-year-old.</p>
    <p>But his fears for his job have since been eased. He said the com­pany’s chief ex­ec­u­tive had been giv­ing reg­u­lar updates on how it was do­ing, such as how it ex­pects con­tin­ued de­mand for its prod­ucts. That served to re­as­sure him.</p>
    <p>Mr Khalid, who is not mar­ried, re­ceived fur­ther re­as­sur­ance yes­ter­day af­ter an en­hanced train­ing sup­port pack­age was ex­tended to the aero­space sec­tor. The pack­age gives aero­space work­ers ac­cess to more than 13,000 train­ing places with higher sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said it is vi­tal for the sec­tor to re­tain work­ers, given the spe­cialised skills they pos­sess.</p>
    <p>Mr Khalid said: “It is as­sur­ing be­cause you know the Govern­ment is in­vest­ing in and sup­port­ing us, and we would like to give back in terms of our ef­fort.”</p>
    <p>Mr Khalid, who com­pleted his trainee­ship in July, has also been at­tend­ing on­line train­ing cour­ses pro­vided by his com­pany. He now looks for­ward to tap­ping the train­ing sup­port pack­age to fur­ther up­grade him­self.</p>
