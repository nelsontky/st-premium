    <p>Devot­ing time to self-de­vel­op­ment and pick­ing up new skills has been the best in­vest­ment he has made, says ac­tor-host Al­lan Wu.</p>
    <p>While he con­sid­ers him­self for­tu­nate to have clinched work in China, where the projects come with “a lot more ze­roes”, the 48-year-old Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent in­tends to con­tinue fo­cus­ing his time and en­ergy on self-in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>“This in­cludes as­sess­ing what new skills might make me more em­ploy­able and mar­ketable in the busi­ness and com­mer­cial sec­tors,” said the Amer­i­can, best known as the host of ad­ven­ture re­al­ity show The Amaz­ing Race Asia.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways be­lieved that as an ac­tor, we must treat our­selves as a busi­ness project. This in­cludes find­ing the right projects, align­ing the right part­ners, work­ing with rel­e­vant brands and mar­ket­ing our­selves to both pro­fes­sional and com­mer­cial en­ti­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>The en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try can be a slog for the vast ma­jor­ity of artists, but the size of the mar­ket is very im­por­tant, he said, point­ing out how the mar­ket in China has a lot more lu­cra­tive op­por­tu­ni­ties than in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal age and rise of in­flu­encers in re­cent years have also forced him to adapt to the times, though he said he prob­a­bly would not be as ac­tive on so­cial me­dia if he was not in the en­ter­tain­ment busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“I see this as the norm and the fu­ture for how we mar­ket our­selves, as well as other busi­nesses and in­dus­tries. That’s why I fi­nally learnt to em­brace the in­flu­encer cul­ture,” added Wu, who has more than 40,000 fol­low­ers on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>But the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has taken a se­vere toll on the in­dus­try, with many up­com­ing projects and pro­duc­tions ei­ther post­poned or canned, he said.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing this cur­rent work land­scape into con­sid­er­a­tion, I knew I had to pivot and work on some­thing else that would be rel­e­vant to the cur­rent mar­ket con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>This was one of the rea­sons he started me­dia pro­duc­tion com­pany The Film Dis­pen­sary ear­lier this year. The firm’s co-founders in­clude pre­sen­ter Claire Je­drek and rac­ing driver Yuey Tan.</p>
    <p>Since Septem­ber, it has been work­ing on a mar­ket­ing and brand­ing project for Ot­saw, a Sin­ga­pore­head­quar­tered ro­bot­ics com­pany.</p>
    <p>Wu, who was born in Cal­i­for­nia to Chi­nese immigrant par­ents and stud­ied in­te­gra­tive bi­ol­ogy at the Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley, said he grew up in a fru­gal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“My mother was the one who taught me to be grate­ful for what I have, be­cause a lot of peo­ple out there have a lot less than we did.”</p>
    <p>When it comes to his own chil­dren, Wu said he is lucky that they are very sen­si­ble.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ter, Sage, 16, and son Jonas, 14, live with his ex-wife, for­mer ac­tress Wong Li Lin. The chil­dren are Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>“They’re very well-ad­justed and they un­der­stand the value of money,” he said, not­ing that his daugh­ter took on a part-time job as a wait­ress last year.</p>
    <p>His ex-wife han­dles more of the chil­dren’s day-to-day ex­penses, but he is in charge of the big-ticket ex­pen­di­tures, such as their in­ter­na­tional school fees and in­sur­ance poli­cies, Wu said.</p>
    <p>Their school fees are where the bulk of his earn­ings have gone to, he jested.</p>
    <p>Wu, who is cur­rently sin­gle, said he used to be more pre­oc­cu­pied with keep­ing up with the Joneses, es­pe­cially work­ing in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, where he would see peers driv­ing nice cars or own­ing lux­ury items.</p>
    <p>“There was a time that I was in­flu­enced by that, and felt that I had to be that way too. But then I re­alised that try­ing to be like every­one didn’t in­crease my qual­ity of life or make me hap­pier.”</p>
    <p>With that epiphany, he wants his chil­dren to know: “It is more im­por­tant to go out into the world and dis­cover what makes you happy.</p>
    <p>“If you’re able to make a liv­ing out of it, then you will never have to work a day in your life. Also, never spend be­yond your means, be­cause we don’t re­ally need much to be happy – we just need to find out what are the sur­pris­ingly few things that we ac­tu­ally do need.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A My per­sonal port­fo­lio con­sists of stocks, mu­tual funds, a 401(k) re­tire­ment plan in the United States, a money mar­ket ac­count, life in­sur­ance poli­cies and real es­tate.</p>
    <p>About 10 per cent to 20 per cent of my port­fo­lio is in stocks and about 10 per cent to 15 per cent is in mu­tual funds. About one-fifth is in real es­tate. Some stocks I hold in­clude Mi­crosoft, Cisco Sys­tems, AMD and a few bio-tech start-ups.</p>
    <p>I be­gan play­ing with the stock mar­ket and in­vest­ing af­ter I grad­u­ated from uni­ver­sity. I had friends work­ing in the fi­nance and busi­ness in­dus­try, so I would learn from them about which com­pa­nies could po­ten­tially be a good in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter do­ing some re­search my­self, I de­cided to open up a stock port­fo­lio and gave it a shot.</p>
    <p>As I have grown older, I have pre­ferred to in­vest more in mu­tual funds, which are more sta­ble.</p>
    <p>I have been work­ing to­wards re­duc­ing my ex­po­sure to stocks be­cause I re­ally do not have the in­ter­est or time to stay on top of the com­pa­nies like I used to.</p>
    <p>I pre­fer to just let the in­vest­ments just “sit there” and hope­fully watch it grow an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>This works bet­ter with in­vest­ments that have spread out the risk and are not as volatile to mar­ket con­di­tions or out­side vari­ables.</p>
    <p>My stocks, mu­tual funds and re­tire­ment funds are con­cen­trated in the US, while my in­sur­ance poli­cies and real es­tate in­vest­ments are in Sin­ga­pore. I have in­vested in one res­i­den­tial apart­ment and a com­mer­cial unit here and I am on the look­out for other com­mer­cial prop­erty op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>I in­vested in lo­cal craft beer brand Brew­lan­der a few years ago, but ex­ited the com­pany last year.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A I think we all learn about the value of money and in­vest­ing at a fairly young age, es­pe­cially in this dig­i­tal age. For me, it started in col­lege, when I set up an events pro­mo­tion com­pany that tar­geted the Asian-Amer­i­can stu­dent com­mu­nity in the San Fran­cisco Bay Area.</p>
    <p>I would also dis­cuss com­pa­nies and in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties with my friends.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I will just keep work­ing in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try as long as there is some­one out there that would like me to work for them in this crazy busi­ness.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve for many artists, the in­dus­try usu­ally “re­tires” us be­fore we can de­cide to re­tire, so I will just con­tinue un­til my time is up.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, I will con­tinue to seek out other busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties to pre­pare me for that day.</p>
    <p>Q Money-wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My par­ents were first-gen­er­a­tion im­mi­grants from China, so they started out with very lit­tle. My fa­ther is a civil en­gi­neer, while my mother is a house­wife. My younger brother, Danny, is a cap­tain in the Los An­ge­les fire depart­ment.</p>
    <p>We were for­tu­nate enough to move to an up­per mid­dle-class area in Los An­ge­les and at­tend school in a good dis­trict. I spent a lot of time out­doors play­ing var­i­ous sports and I think that es­tab­lished the foun­da­tion for my pas­sion for the out­doors and be­ing ac­tive.</p>
    <p>MOV­ING AWAY FROM STOCKS</p>
    <p>As I have grown older, I have pre­ferred to in­vest more in mu­tual funds, which are more sta­ble. I have been work­ing to­wards re­duc­ing my ex­po­sure to stocks be­cause I re­ally do not have the in­ter­est or time to stay on top of the com­pa­nies like I used to.</p>
    <p>Q I drive... A</p>
    <p>I ride a Du­cati Mon­ster 1000 mo­tor­cy­cle. I do not en­joy driv­ing any­more be­cause rid­ing is so much more fun and con­ve­nient, ex­cept when it is rain­ing. With ride-shar­ing plat­forms avail­able, I do not re­ally see the need to own a car.</p>
    <p>It was more of a ne­ces­sity when my chil­dren were younger, but they are older and very in­de­pen­dent now, so they can take pub­lic trans­porta­tion or call for a taxi or pri­vate-hire ve­hi­cle them­selves.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A A rented two-bed­room apart­ment in the Thom­son area that is about 1,200 sq ft.</p>
