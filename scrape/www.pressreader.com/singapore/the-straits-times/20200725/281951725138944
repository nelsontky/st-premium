    <p>• Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den and for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama have blasted Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in a video, as the Bi­den cam­paign tapped the star power of Amer­ica’s first black pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who was vice-pres­i­dent in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, sat down fac­ing Mr Obama in a chair across a room for a “so­cially dis­tanced” con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>They re­leased the video on Thurs­day on Twit­ter, where Mr Obama has 120.8 mil­lion fol­low­ers, the most on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>“Can you imag­ine stand­ing up when you were pres­i­dent, say­ing, ‘It’s not my re­spon­si­bil­ity?’ ” Mr Bi­den asked Mr Obama, re­fer­ring to Mr Trump’s ef­forts to evade crit­i­cism for his re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Those words didn’t come out of our mouths when we were in of­fice,” Mr Obama replied.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Trump at­tacked them on Twit­ter, writ­ing: “Re­mem­ber, I wouldn’t even be here if it weren’t for them. They did a ter­ri­ble job!”</p>
    <p>With tra­di­tional cam­paign­ing still in limbo due to the pan­demic, the video of­fered a glimpse of how Mr Obama – still over­whelm­ingly pop­u­lar among Demo­cratic vot­ers – may be de­ployed to build en­thu­si­asm for Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing their first in-per­son meet­ing since Mr Bi­den be­came the pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic nom­i­nee, the two men spoke about the need to ex­pand on the Af­ford­able Care Act (ACA), also known as Oba­macare, their ad­min­is­tra­tion’s sig­na­ture pro­gramme that vastly ex­panded US health­care cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has pe­ti­tioned the US Supreme Court to in­val­i­date the ACA.</p>
    <p>“It is hard to fathom any­body want­ing to take away peo­ple’s health­care in the mid­dle of a ma­jor pub­lic health cri­sis,” Mr Obama said.</p>
    <p>They also dis­cussed Mr Bi­den’s abil­ity to em­pathise, a trait his cam­paign has stressed to con­trast him with Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“I don’t un­der­stand his in­abil­ity to get a sense of what peo­ple are go­ing through,” Mr Bi­den said. “He can’t re­late in any way.”</p>
    <p>Mr Obama said: “It is a sign of lead­er­ship when you are will­ing to hear other peo­ple’s ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>
