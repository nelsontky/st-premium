    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered is plan­ning its sec­ond dig­i­tal-only bank in Asia, team­ing up with NTUC En­ter­prise, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter. The Lon­don-based bank would hold a ma­jor­ity stake in the new ven­ture, with the re­main­der held by NTUC En­ter­prise, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered Bank is plan­ning its sec­ond dig­i­tal-only bank in Asia, team­ing up with NTUC En­ter­prise, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The Lon­don-based bank would hold a ma­jor­ity stake in the new ven­ture, with the re­main­der held by NTUC En­ter­prise, said the peo­ple, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied as the mat­ter re­mains con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>NTUC En­ter­prise is the hold­ing en­tity and sin­gle largest share­holder of the labour move­ment’s so­cial en­ter­prises, which in­clude FairPrice, NTUC First Cam­pus, NTUC Food­fare, Ko­pi­tiam, NTUC Health, In­come and NTUC Learn­ingHub.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from NTUC En­ter­prise and Stan­dard Char­tered in Sin­ga­pore de­clined to com­ment when con­tacted by The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Alex Twigg, co-founder of Aus­tralian start-up Judo Bank, has been hired for the busi­ness, which has been code-named Project Phoenix, the peo­ple added.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered is ac­cel­er­at­ing its dig­i­tal strat­egy in Sin­ga­pore to com­pete with larger lo­cal ri­vals such as DBS Bank and non-bank chal­lengers, in­clud­ing Grab, which has ap­plied for one of the coun­try’s dig­i­tal li­cences.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), the fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tor, will hand out as many as five dig­i­tal li­cences to non-banks this year.</p>
    <p>Talks on Stan­dard Char­tered’s new ini­tia­tive with NTUC are on­go­ing and the plan is at an early stage, said the peo­ple, who did not pro­vide a time­line.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered and its lo­cal part­ners ob­tained a dig­i­tal-only bank li­cence in Hong Kong last year. Known as Mox, the vir­tual bank is not fully op­er­a­tional yet, but Stan­dard Char­tered said in its earn­ings re­port late last month that it will be launched “very soon”. It also has sev­eral dig­i­tal banks in Africa.</p>
    <p>MAS said ear­lier this month that it plans to re­vise rules gov­ern­ing for­eign lenders with a sub­stan­tial lo­cal pres­ence that may al­low them to set up dig­i­tal-only bank­ing sub­sidiaries. It also des­ig­nated Stan­dard Char­tered as the coun­try’s first Sig­nif­i­cantly Rooted For­eign Bank (SRFB), re­flect­ing the bank’s sub­stan­tial pres­ence in the city state.</p>
    <p>For­eign banks that “sub­stan­tially” ex­ceed the SRFB cri­te­ria may be al­lowed to es­tab­lish a dig­i­tal-only bank, the MAS said.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered has in­creased its lo­cal work­force to 10,000 from 8,000 in the last few years, the bank said in a press re­lease ear­lier this month. Some 70 per cent of the lo­cal man­age­ment team is Sin­ga­porean, it said.</p>
    <p>Judo Bank fo­cuses on lend­ing to small and medium-sized busi­nesses, ac­cord­ing to its web­site.</p>
    <p>Mr Twigg, ac­cord­ing to his LinkedIn pro­file, also helped found UBank, an­other on­line lender, which is part of Na­tional Aus­tralian Bank.</p>
    <p>Mr Twigg left Judo Bank in June, ac­cord­ing to co-founder Joseph Healy. Mr Twigg could not be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered is ac­cel­er­at­ing its dig­i­tal strat­egy in Sin­ga­pore to com­pete with larger lo­cal ri­vals such as DBS Bank and non-bank chal­lengers, in­clud­ing Grab, which has ap­plied for one of the coun­try’s dig­i­tal li­cences. The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), the fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tor, will hand out as many as five dig­i­tal li­cences to non-banks this year.</p>
