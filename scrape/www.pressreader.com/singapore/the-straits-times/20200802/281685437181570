    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong opened a tem­po­rary field hos­pi­tal with 500 beds yes­ter­day to house sta­ble Covid-19 pa­tients as the city bat­tles a new wave of virus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial hub had been a poster child for tack­ling the coron­avirus, with lo­cal trans­mis­sions all but ended by early sum­mer.</p>
    <p>But since last month, the pathogen has re­turned, with some cases brought in by the tens of thou­sands of peo­ple who were ex­empted from a manda­tory quar­an­tine im­posed on most ar­rivals.</p>
    <p>More than 2,000 new in­fec­tions have been de­tected since the start of last month – 60 per cent of the total since the virus first hit the city in late Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The new makeshift hos­pi­tal, set up at the city’s Asi­aWorld-Expo ex­hi­bi­tion centre near the air­port, will take in Covid-19 pa­tients aged from 18 to 60. “Our goal is to triage the pa­tients from the com­mu­nity and pro­vide them with ap­pro­pri­ate treat­ment and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion ar­range­ment,” Dr Larry Lee from the Hos­pi­tal Au­thor­ity told the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee said that around 20 to 30 pa­tients are ex­pected to be ad­mit­ted on the first day. The ar­riv­ing pa­tients will go through X-rays as well as blood, saliva and heart tests.</p>
    <p>If found un­sta­ble, pa­tients will be sent to hos­pi­tals, while sta­ble ones will get treat­ment and be put un­der med­i­cal ob­ser­va­tion at the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The city recorded 125 new cases yes­ter­day, the 11th day in a row above 100, with total in­fec­tion num­bers ris­ing to 3,396.</p>
    <p>The death toll has risen from seven to 31 since last month.</p>
    <p>China has of­fered to send main­land test­ing staff to the city to carry out “large-scale nu­cleic acid test­ing”.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion of China said in a state­ment that it had set up a team com­pris­ing 60 clin­i­cal lab­o­ra­tory staff and an “ad­vance unit” would ar­rive in the city to­day.</p>
