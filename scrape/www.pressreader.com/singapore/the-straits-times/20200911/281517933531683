    <p>My well-sourced col­league Wahyudi So­e­ri­aat­madja’s re­port this week that jock­ey­ing has al­ready started in Jakarta for pole po­si­tion to re­place Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, when his sec­ond and fi­nal term ends in 2024, sent the mind back to a meet­ing with the In­done­sian leader early in his first term.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko, who has been pop­u­larly known as Jokowi since a French client of his erst­while fur­ni­ture busi­ness coined the word, was then the pop­u­lar out­sider who’d up­ended many elite cal­cu­la­tions with his dra­matic rise from may­oralty of Solo to gov­er­nor­ship of Jakarta in 2012 and two years later, the pres­i­dency it­self.</p>
    <p>When Straits Times ed­i­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez and I were granted an in­ter­view to see Jokowi, it was to the pres­i­den­tial palace in Bo­gor, not Jakarta, that we were sum­moned. Through­out the in­ter­view, we no­ticed that two pres­i­den­tial ad­vis­ers on for­eign pol­icy and eco­nomics fre­quently in­ter­vened, of­ten seek­ing to cor­rect a num­ber the Pres­i­dent had spouted, or at­tempt­ing to guide a pres­i­den­tial line of thought.</p>
    <p>At the end of the meet­ing, Mr</p>
    <p>Joko of­fered us a tour of the palace grounds and gar­dens where, un­har­nessed from his ad­vis­ers, he spoke freely of his plans for In­done­sia, the growth he was tar­get­ing and how he in­tended to get there. The gar­den is open to the pub­lic and Mr Joko was, of course, in­stantly recog­nised – and mobbed. The golf buggy we were trav­el­ling in had to make fre­quent stops.</p>
    <p>It was all per­fectly cued of course; Mr Joko was fully aware of the im­pact his ap­pear­ance would have on the pub­lic and made full use of it for the cam­eras.</p>
    <p>JOKOWI THEN AND NOW</p>
    <p>Go­ing through for­mer Fi­nan­cial Times jour­nal­ist Ben Bland’s Lowy In­sti­tute paper, “Man of Con­tra­dic­tions – Joko Wi­dodo and the strug­gle to re­make In­done­sia”, pub­lished re­cently as a book by Pen­guin Ran­dom House, it has been tempt­ing to com­pare the Jokowi we saw five years ago and the man he is to­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko con­tin­ues to be the soft-spo­ken, af­fa­ble per­son of sim­ple habits with a high de­gree of ap­proach­a­bil­ity. But any­one who sized him up as a mere ac­ci­dent of his­tory – the Solo may­oralty was a re­sult of In­done­sia’s first-ever di­rect elec­tions for lo­cal lead­ers – or a jumped-up coun­try bump­kin will surely have to sec­ond-guess their as­sess­ments.</p>
    <p>This is a leader who has out­smarted his party big­wigs, stitched up an ar­ray of sup­port that to­day ac­counts for three-quar­ters of MPs in Par­lia­ment, dumped a loyal deputy in or­der to suit his po­lit­i­cal ex­i­gen­cies against a tide of Is­lamist fer­vour and later steered him into a big job at the state oil com­pany, and im­pres­sively, roped into Cab­i­net a man who bit­terly op­posed him in two pres­i­den­tial elec­tions and now clearly wants to be his suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Not bad for a politi­cian whose de­but may­oral vic­tory was ac­com­plished by a mere 37 per cent of the vote, pre­vail­ing over three other con­tenders. In hind­sight, it seems no ac­ci­dent that when he re­con­tested the same seat, he polled 90 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>To­day, I doubt that any pres­i­den­tial ad­viser will dare con­tra­dict him, and cer­tainly not when out­siders are in the room. More of­ten than not, he has dis­played the nous to get his way, whether with dif­fi­cult party el­ders of his PDI-P (In­done­sian Demo­cratic Party of Strug­gle) or the scle­rotic and cor­rupt bu­reau­cracy that is widely seen as In­done­sia’s bane and de­vel­op­ment brake.</p>
    <p>Those who un­der­rated him once now know that Mr Joko is a man who be­lieves in hold­ing his friends close, and his en­e­mies even closer.</p>
    <p>With four years to go to the end of his con­sti­tu­tion­ally lim­ited term, it is prob­a­bly a tri­fle too early to pass judg­ment on this Ja­vanese son, who is per­haps more of an enigma or para­dox than the bun­dle of con­tra­dic­tions that Mr Bland de­scribes.</p>
    <p>DIS­RUPTED PLANS</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Covid-19 pan­demic has up­ended ev­ery­thing for ev­ery­one. Most lead­ers keep the tough de­ci­sions – es­pe­cially ones where they may have to ex­pend po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal – for their fi­nal term. If Mr Joko had in­tended to break new paths in re­form, much of it is moot now. Cer­tainly, pri­or­i­ties have to be re­drawn.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s ur­gent need, of course, is to con­trol the dis­ease out­break, which is prov­ing dif­fi­cult to do. Only its woe­ful test­ing record – fewer than 10,000 per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion – pre­vents it from over­tak­ing the Philip­pines in the recorded case load.</p>
    <p>Be­yond Covid-19 are other en­dur­ing pri­or­i­ties and, of course, some plans need to be re­drawn; al­most cer­tainly shelved, for in­stance, is the planned shift of the na­tional cap­i­tal to East Kal­i­man­tan – if ever the pro­posal was a se­ri­ous one to be­gin with.</p>
    <p>Along­side, there are signs of elite de­cay: the hints of dy­nasty as his son and son-in-law show an ap­petite for elec­toral pol­i­tics; the in­stinct to cut down or trim the feath­ers of Cab­i­net fig­ures seen as get­ting too pow­er­ful or pop­u­lar; the move to curb the pow­er­ful anti-cor­rup­tion com­mis­sion even as his de­fend­ers say he was merely rid­ding it of el­e­ments that tilted to­wards Is­lamist groups; the vast in­flu­ence that his mother, who died ear­lier this year of can­cer, re­port­edly wielded in some key ap­point­ments; and a grow­ing ten­dency to rely on mil­i­tary fig­ures to get the job done across a va­ri­ety of fields. Some of this is in­evitable and al­most all of it is for In­done­sia to nav­i­gate in­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING AHEAD</p>
    <p>Be­yond its bor­ders, though, the rest of South-east Asia would be grate­ful – and will prob­a­bly judge his ten­ure – over how Mr Joko tack­les three ar­eas in his re­main­ing years.</p>
    <p>First is eco­nomic pol­icy, par­tic­u­larly trade pol­icy. If he finds it po­lit­i­cally dif­fi­cult to open the econ­omy fur­ther, his South-east Asian cousins will be pray­ing that he at least does not set up new walls.</p>
    <p>As I wrote a few weeks ago, In­done­sia al­ready has the high­est non-tar­iff mea­sures in South-east Asia af­ter Thai­land and the Philip­pines, and in the post-Covid-19 en­vi­ron­ment, pres­sure will mount on the ad­min­is­tra­tion to be even more pro­tec­tive of shar­ing the do­mes­tic mar­ket. In­deed, you can spot the signs; for­eign in­vestors com­plain that Jakarta these days fre­quently de­mands to see lo­cal­i­sa­tion plans from in­vestors, even for sec­tors such as phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, where the coun­try does not have the do­mes­tic tal­ent or re­sources to sus­tain the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>On the po­lit­i­cal front, es­pe­cially dur­ing elec­tion time, par­ties will be tempted to use the Is­lamic and eth­nic cards to gar­ner votes. Mr Joko him­self has suf­fered on this score. In his first run for the pres­i­dency, the cam­paign of his ri­val and now De­fence Min­is­ter, Mr Prabowo Su­bianto, in­sin­u­ated he was eth­nic Chi­nese, Christian and com­mu­nist – all fault lines in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>To­day, four of the nine po­lit­i­cal par­ties in Par­lia­ment, which to­gether ac­count for 30 per cent of the seats, are con­sid­ered “Is­lamic” par­ties, and all of them want their faith to have a big­ger say in na­tional pol­i­tics. Steer­ing the na­tion through these wa­ters with­out com­pro­mis­ing on its es­sen­tial plu­ral­is­tic char­ac­ter will be a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran In­done­sia watcher Richard Bor­suk points out that the pres­i­dency isn’t what it used to be in the late Suharto’s time. “No pres­i­dent has the power and con­trol of do­mes­tic events the way the strong­man had in his prime,” he says. “Power is more dis­persed to­day.”</p>
    <p>Given the na­ture of the In­done­sian na­tion – its ge­o­graph­i­cal sprawl and mul­ti­tude of eth­nic­i­ties and lan­guages – the coun­try could eas­ily have splin­tered, like Yu­goslavia, with un­told spillover ef­fects for the re­gion. It is a credit to Mr Joko and oth­ers be­fore him that they have man­aged to hold it to­gether.</p>
    <p>But the job is never com­plete. In­deed, this is why, in nam­ing him The Straits Times Asian of the Year 2019, the paper’s edi­tors noted in their ci­ta­tion that “while cog­nisant of the chal­lenges he faces, we nonethe­less ex­press the hope that the Pres­i­dent will give no quar­ter and make no com­pro­mise in his quest to build a demo­cratic, cor­rup­tion-free, open, tol­er­ant and in­clu­sive In­done­sia”.</p>
    <p>And third, the re­gion would wel­come a more ac­tive, if not as­sertive, for­eign pol­icy, one that goes be­yond the purely trans­ac­tional.</p>
    <p>Too many times Jakarta has raised hopes that it will play to its size and de­served in­flu­ence. Cer­tainly, Mr Joko’s pre­de­ces­sor Susilo Bambang Yud­hoy­ono, en­cour­aged by his en­er­getic for­eign min­is­ter Marty Natale­gawa, held up that prom­ise. But even his most ar­dent ad­mir­ers con­cede that Mr Joko has un­der­per­formed on that score.</p>
    <p>Early in his ten­ure, Mr Joko voiced the idea of turn­ing In­done­sia into a “global mar­itime ful­crum”, un­veil­ing the plan at the East Asia Sum­mit held in Myan­mar in Novem­ber 2014. Like­wise, just be­fore last year’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, he briefly sought the global stage by invit­ing his East Asia Sum­mit part­ners to dis­cuss an Asean Out­look on the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the lat­ter con­cept turned out to be an unin­spir­ing one, couched in the lan­guage of Asean’s main prin­ci­ples; some thought he was merely in­ter­ested in show­ing a bit of states­man­ship that might be use­ful for him ahead of the polls.</p>
    <p>GREATER HORI­ZONS</p>
    <p>As for the ful­crum idea, Mr Bland notes, on the flight home to Jakarta, Mr Joko was al­ready telling peo­ple that his idea of “free and ac­tive” was to make friends with coun­tries that could pro­vide ben­e­fits – “What’s the point of mak­ing friends if we are al­ways on the los­ing end?”</p>
    <p>Such things pro­mote per­cep­tions that Mr Joko’s idea of for­eign pol­icy is that it is a tool to be de­ployed for lit­tle more than build­ing the econ­omy, in­fra­struc­ture and his per­sonal po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it hasn’t es­caped no­tice that he barely touched on for­eign pol­icy or mar­itime is­sues in his sec­ond-term in­au­gu­ra­tion speech last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko, de­spite his ob­vi­ous shaky han­dling of the pan­demic, re­mains widely pop­u­lar with the bulk of In­done­sians. His grip on power comes from an as­sid­u­ous cul­ti­va­tion of a “man of the peo­ple” im­age, com­bined with a nat­u­ral cool that helps him nav­i­gate the warm­est cross-cur­rents of pol­i­tics with sub­tlety and fi­nesse. South-east Asians would cheer if he ap­plied some of those qual­i­ties for the ben­e­fit of the wider re­gion as well.</p>
