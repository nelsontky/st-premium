    <p>The anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tions in Belarus may die down; af­ter all, the coun­try ex­pe­ri­enced a sim­i­lar bout of pop­u­lar dis­sent a decade ago, and that ul­ti­mately pe­tered out.</p>
    <p>But if the cur­rent anti-gov­ern­ment ri­ots are sus­tained, Europe could soon find it­self em­broiled in a show­down of ma­jor con­se­quences with Rus­sia, not dis­sim­i­lar from the one over Ukraine in 2014.</p>
    <p>Like Ukraine, Belarus be­came in­de­pen­dent when the Soviet Union dis­in­te­grated in 1991. Un­like Ukraine, how­ever, which has a long his­tory of in­de­pen­dent ex­is­tence and a strong sense of its own na­tional iden­tity, Belarus – a name that trans­lates as “White Rus­sia” – has nei­ther.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko, 65, the man who has ruled the coun­try for a quar­ter of a cen­tury, has cap­i­talised on this lack of a strong civil so­ci­ety. A former man­ager of a col­lec­tive farm, Mr Lukashenko is proud of his poor ed­u­ca­tion. He runs the coun­try with an iron fist; Belarus has long been known as “Europe’s last dic­ta­tor­ship”.</p>
    <p>And he is of­ten capri­cious. Dur­ing the cur­rent coro­n­avirus pan­demic, for in­stance, he sim­ply re­fused to ob­serve any health pre­cau­tions and claims to have suc­ceeded in pre­vent­ing deaths, mainly be­cause he also con­trols the sta­tis­ti­cal of­fice.</p>
    <p>Belarus re­lies largely on Rus­sia’s eco­nomic sub­si­dies and pro­tec­tion; un­der Mr Lukashenko, it has been trans­formed into a theme park of the old Soviet Union, com­plete with old Soviet sym­bols, in­clud­ing com­mu­nist stars on the coun­try’s na­tional em­blem.</p>
    <p>The se­cret of Mr Lukashenko’s rul­ing method is the avoid­ance of all eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal re­forms: The coun­try’s econ­omy is largely state-owned, the peo­ple’s stan­dard of liv­ing is less than half the European av­er­age, but many vot­ers seemed con­tent with the guar­an­tee of a job or a pen­sion, even if both are of­ten not much above sub­sis­tence lev­els.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal dis­sent has al­ways been very fee­ble. So, as Mr Lukashenko ap­proached the elec­tion on</p>
    <p>Sun­day, he had ev­ery rea­son to ex­pect an al­most unan­i­mous en­dorse­ment of his bid for a sixth pres­i­den­tial term.</p>
    <p>But then, the un­ex­pected hap­pened. Ms Svet­lana Tikhanousk­aya, a 37-year-old teacher of English mar­ried to one of the coun­try’s lead­ing hu­man rights ac­tivists who is cur­rently un­der ar­rest, chose to stand as an in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>Her youth, vi­tal­ity and ev­i­dent sin­cer­ity elec­tri­fied the elec­torate, and par­tic­u­larly the gen­er­a­tion of peo­ple who know no other leader but Mr Lukashenko. Ms Tikhanousk­aya’s message of hope and prom­ise of in­te­gra­tion with the European Union trans­formed her into a for­mi­da­ble op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>There was never any ques­tion of a fair count in this elec­tion; Mr Lukashenko’s of­fi­cials made sure that they ap­pointed most of the re­turn­ing of­fi­cers, elec­toral rolls were doc­tored and an im­plau­si­ble num­ber of peo­ple were de­clared to have voted in the first few hours af­ter vot­ing sta­tions opened, a time-hon­oured trick to jus­tify the stuff­ing of bal­lot boxes.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin will be key to what may hap­pen in the days to come. He does not like Mr Lukashenko; re­la­tions be­tween the two are known to be poor. But Rus­sia can­not af­ford to lose its in­flu­ence in Belarus, af­ter see­ing its in­flu­ence in Ukraine evap­o­rate back in 2014 un­der sim­i­lar con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But it is the sheer scale of Mr Lukashenko’s claimed victory – al­legedly 80 per cent of the vote – which looks ut­terly im­pos­si­ble; re­turns from Belarus’ em­bassies over­seas, where its ci­ti­zens also voted, have in­vari­ably shown him los­ing by a large mar­gin.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve my own eyes – the ma­jor­ity was for us,” Ms Tikhanousk­aya told re­porters im­me­di­ately af­ter the of­fi­cial tally was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>By pro­claim­ing such an im­plau­si­ble victory, the Be­laru­sian leader is ev­i­dently cal­cu­lat­ing that he can rely on his po­lice and mil­i­tary to crush the pub­lic out­rage. He dis­missed the protesters as “sheep” un­der for­eign con­trol who were “want­ing to spoil the hol­i­day” of the Pres­i­dent’s re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But his is a huge gam­ble. For the ex­pe­ri­ence of all other former Soviet states in­di­cates that, if the protesters re­main de­ter­mined and come out in large enough num­bers, sooner or later they suc­ceed in crack­ing open even the most tightly con­trolled regime.</p>
    <p>There are al­ready re­ports of po­lice re­fus­ing to put down demon­stra­tions in Belarus’ coun­try­side.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin will be key to what may hap­pen in the days to come. He does not like Mr Lukashenko; re­la­tions be­tween the two are known to be poor.</p>
    <p>But Rus­sia can­not af­ford to lose its in­flu­ence in Belarus, af­ter see­ing its in­flu­ence in Ukraine evap­o­rate back in 2014 un­der sim­i­lar con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>That is why the Rus­sian leader was prompt in recog­nis­ing Mr Lukashenko’s re-elec­tion, while point­edly re­stat­ing Rus­sia’s “in­ter­est in re­tain­ing a sta­ble do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in Belarus”.</p>
    <p>Still, the cri­sis presents a huge dilemma for both Rus­sia and the rest of Europe. The EU can­not help but sym­pa­thise with the Be­laru­sian opposition; if Mr Lukashenko re­mains the coun­try’s pres­i­dent, the reim­po­si­tion of eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal sanc­tions on his coun­try – which were only re­cently lifted – will be in­evitable.</p>
    <p>But if the cur­rent events suc­ceed in over­throw­ing Mr Lukashenko, the race will be on be­tween Rus­sia and the EU for the loy­alty of the next Be­laru­sian gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>And that is not a race that Pres­i­dent Putin can af­ford to lose.</p>
