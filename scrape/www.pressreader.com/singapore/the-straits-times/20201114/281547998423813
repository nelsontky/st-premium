    <p>To at­tract top for­eign tech tal­ent, Sin­ga­pore is launch­ing a new work pass next year called Tech.Pass, and ap­pli­ca­tions for it will start in Jan­uary. A global race for top tech tal­ent is on and com­pe­ti­tion is stiff. With the pass, Sin­ga­pore now ranks among coun­tries that have in­tro­duced spe­cial visas to woo such global tech tal­ent.</p>
    <p>What’s the story</p>
    <p>In a bid to at­tract top-tier for­eign tech tal­ent, Sin­ga­pore is launch­ing a new work pass next year called Tech.Pass, which will be valid for two years, with the op­tion to be re­newed once for an­other two years.</p>
    <p>Pass hold­ers can start and op­er­ate a busi­ness, serve on the board of di­rec­tors of a Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany or be a share­holder or in­vestor in com­pa­nies here. They can also take up lec­tur­ing roles in in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, serve as a men­tor or an ad­viser to com­pa­nies here, and con­duct cor­po­rate train­ing.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for it will start in Jan­uary, and for a start, 500 places will be avail­able. Can­di­dates must meet var­i­ous cri­te­ria to show that they are high-level pro­fes­sion­als in the tech in­dus­try. There will be strin­gent re­quire­ments for re­newal of the pass too.</p>
    <p>The Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board will ad­min­is­ter Tech.Pass, with the sup­port of the Min­istry of Man­power. Tech.Pass builds on the Tech@SG pro­gramme, which was in­tro­duced last year and spells out more flex­i­ble re­quire­ments for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als to ap­ply for an Employment Pass (EP), which ap­plies to those with a fixed monthly salary of at least $4,500.</p>
    <p>Why it mat­ters</p>
    <p>A global race for top tech tal­ent is on, and like Sin­ga­pore, many coun­tries have been try­ing to make their pitch to such in­di­vid­u­als whose cap­i­tal, net­works and know-how will be valu­able in help­ing grow their tech in­dus­tries and create jobs.</p>
    <p>With Tech.Pass, Sin­ga­pore now ranks among coun­tries like France, Malaysia, Thai­land and Bri­tain, which have in­tro­duced spe­cial visas to woo global tech tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion is stiff – Bri­tain, for in­stance, saw a record num­ber of ap­pli­cants last month for its Tech Na­tion visa, de­spite the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And given the many op­tions that tech pro­fes­sion­als have, firms in the re­gion are find­ing it dif­fi­cult to get tech ex­perts to lead their teams and projects. In a study re­leased last year, re­cruit­ment con­sul­tancy Robert Wal­ters found that in South-east Asia, close to 70 per cent of hir­ing man­agers took at least three months to fill an open tech po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal firms are get­ting wor­ried too – re­search by spe­cialised re­cruiter Robert Half last year found that more than 90 per cent of Sin­ga­porean IT lead­ers were con­cerned that Sin­ga­pore does not have the IT tal­ent read­ily avail­able to build a Smart Na­tion-ready work­force.</p>
    <p>But with Tech.Pass, there is an at­tempt to make Sin­ga­pore even more ap­peal­ing to such work­ers. While the EP re­quires the spon­sor­ship of an em­ployer, Tech.Pass will be tied to the in­di­vid­ual. This gives the pro­fes­sion­als flex­i­bil­ity to de­cide what they want to do.</p>

    <p>What lies ahead</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s In­ter­net econ­omy – or busi­ness con­ducted on­line – is on track to reach US$22 bil­lion (S$29.7 bil­lion) by 2025, which makes it poised to be a large en­gine of growth for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>But other coun­tries in the re­gion also have their eye on the po­ten­tial for growth that the tech sec­tor has. De­spite the dis­rup­tions from Covid-19, South-east Asia’s In­ter­net econ­omy is ex­pected to hit over US$300 bil­lion by 2025.</p>
    <p>In or­der to fully re­alise the po­ten­tial of tech, the Repub­lic will need more movers and shak­ers to grow the in­dus­try here and create op­por­tu­ni­ties for its lo­cal work­ers. It has its work cut out for it­self to meet the high de­mand from com­pa­nies here for skilled man­power.</p>
    <p>There is now a small win­dow to act be­fore such tal­ent gets scooped up by other lo­ca­tions, and Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts now will de­cide if it gets to en­trench it­self as a tech hub.</p>
