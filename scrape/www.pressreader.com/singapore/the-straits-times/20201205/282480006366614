    <p>More ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties have been un­cov­ered in be­lea­guered Hin Leong Trad­ing’s af­fairs by its ju­di­cial man­agers, who are now in­ves­ti­gat­ing why “sub­stan­tial mis­state­ments” in the oil trader’s au­dited fi­nan­cial state­ments were al­legedly not de­tected by its ex­ter­nal au­di­tors Deloitte & Touche.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial man­agers Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers (PwC) Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices, in their sec­ond re­port to the High Court filed on Nov 6, found that Hin Leong’s as­sets were over­stated by US$3.07 bil­lion (S$4.1 bil­lion) for its 2019 fi­nan­cial year, com­pris­ing US$2.27 bil­lion in fake ac­counts re­ceiv­ables (up from US$2.23 bil­lion) and US$800 mil­lion in in­ven­tory short­falls.</p>
    <p>This was done to con­ceal sig­nif­i­cant losses over the years, PwC said in court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>PwC also found that the over­state­ment of Hin Leong’s as­sets went back at least three years, with the ac­counts re­ceiv­ables for its 2018 and 2017 fi­nan­cial years over­stated by about US$1.75 bil­lion and about US$1.48 bil­lion re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that Deloitte gave clean re­ports for 2018 and 2017 even though Hin Leong’s as­sets had been over­stated by more</p>
    <p>than US$1 bil­lion for those two years.</p>
    <p>On Oct 7, PwC re­quested doc­u­ments re­lat­ing to Deloitte’s ex­ter­nal au­dit of Hin Leong for the fi­nan­cial years end­ing 2012 to last year to de­ter­mine if Hin Leong has a cause of ac­tion for re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The Lim fam­ily, who are also bat­tling a law­suit brought by PwC to re­cover US$3.5 bil­lion, de­nied or did not ad­mit to claims in­clud­ing the al­leged ma­nip­u­la­tion of ac­counts re­ceiv­ables in Hin Leong’s ac­counts.</p>
    <p>They blamed it on a “trusted team of em­ploy­ees” who car­ried out Hin Leong’s op­er­a­tional and com­mer­cial ac­tiv­i­ties. The fam­ily, in de­fence pa­pers, claimed the Lim sib­lings, Mr Evan Lim Chee Meng and Ms Lim Huey Ching, were not in­volved in pre­par­ing the com­pany’s au­dited fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to PwC, Hin Leong</p>
    <p>founder Lim Oon Kuin, through his lawyers at Davin­der Singh Cham­bers, has dis­avowed his af­fi­davit filed on April 17, in which he al­leged that pay­ments made to sat­isfy mar­gin calls were re­flected as “ac­counts re­ceiv­ables” in the fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>When asked about his state­ment in his af­fi­davit, Mr O.K. Lim said “his high­est level of ed­u­ca­tion is Sec­ondary 2 and as he is not trained to read fi­nan­cial state­ments, he does not even know what ‘ac­counts re­ceiv­ables’ are”.</p>
    <p>He also stated that he did not give in­struc­tions to any­one in his com­pany to pre­pare the ac­counts without show­ing any losses, PwC said.</p>
    <p>PwC’s re­port said it found Hin Leong had “grossly over­stated its deriva­tives trad­ing prof­its by about US$436 mil­lion” for its 2019 fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>“This over­state­ment of swaps gains en­abled the com­pany to recog­nise net deriva­tives trad­ing gains of US$120 mil­lion for that fi­nan­cial year, without which it would have recorded a sig­nif­i­cant deriva­tives trad­ing loss,” PwC said.</p>
    <p>For the 2018 fi­nan­cial year, PwC found 57 fic­ti­tious swaps trades with four coun­ter­par­ties re­sult­ing in fic­ti­tious net losses of about US$19 mil­lion. For the 2017 fi­nan­cial year, 245 fic­ti­tious swaps trades were cre­ated with 14 coun­ter­par­ties, re­sult­ing in fic­ti­tious swaps net gain of about US$89 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>There was ev­i­dence to sug­gest the com­pany suf­fered ac­cu­mu­lated deriva­tives trad­ing losses of about US$808 mil­lion over the past 10 years. These losses were con­cealed through the over­state­ment of deriva­tives gains in its au­dited fi­nan­cial state­ments by as much as US$2.1 bil­lion over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>PwC found that about US$150 mil­lion in sales trans­ac­tions recorded as at Oct 31 last year were “highly sus­pi­cious be­cause in­ter­bank trans­fers were made to give the false im­pres­sion that pay­ments had been re­ceived”.</p>
    <p>Of these, trans­ac­tions amount­ing to US$114.4 mil­lion were bo­gus as PwC has re­ceived con­fir­ma­tions from three cus­tomers stat­ing that they are not aware of these pur­ported deals.</p>
    <p>PwC is in­ves­ti­gat­ing claims by a fourth customer, Yuan­tai Fuel Trad­ing, which claimed that US$43.3 mil­lion it al­legedly owed to Hin Leong had been “set­tled”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to CNPLaw, the law firm rep­re­sent­ing Yuan­tai, Mr Tan Aik Hock, Yuan­tai’s share­holder and di­rec­tor, has been do­ing busi­ness with Mr O.K. Lim for more than 20 years, and “due to their close busi­ness re­la­tion­ship, they had en­tered into an al­leged oral agree­ment for bro­ker­age fees... to be paid to Yuan­tai for var­i­ous al­leged ser­vices pro­vided to Hin Leong”.</p>
    <p>But PwC did not find ev­i­dence in the com­pany’s records to sup­port Yuan­tai’s claims. In­stead, the records show that the US$43.3 mil­lion was “set­tled through in­ter­bank trans­fers from one of Hin Leong’s bank ac­counts to an­other of its ac­counts to give the false im­pres­sion that Yuan­tai had made pay­ments”.</p>
