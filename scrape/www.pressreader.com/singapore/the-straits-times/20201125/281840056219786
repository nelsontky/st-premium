    <p>A new round of so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules took ef­fect yes­ter­day in the South Korean cap­i­tal, deal­ing a blow to small-busi­ness own­ers de­spite brighter hopes for eco­nomic re­cov­ery af­ter ear­lier suc­cess in bat­tling the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures in­clude clo­sures of night­clubs and karaoke bars, curbs on eat­ing in cafes and restau­rants, fewer night-time pub­lic tran­sit ser­vices, and lim­its on religious ser­vices, wed­dings and fu­ner­als for the next two weeks.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I’ve been left alone in the dark,” said Ms Jung Gong-dan, who runs a pub near Seoul’s Itae­won dis­trict, say­ing she has lost hope af­ter a ban on din­ing in restau­rants af­ter 9pm.</p>
    <p>The “emer­gency pause” in ac­tiv­ity in the densely pop­u­lated cap­i­tal and sur­round­ing ar­eas aims to damp a resur­gence in out­breaks in of­fices, schools and small gath­er­ings that have com­bined to drive a third wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Asia’s fourth-largest econ­omy re­turned to growth in the third quar­ter, re­vers­ing its sharpest con­trac­tion in more than a decade, as the gov­ern­ment pushed through stim­u­lus mea­sures and ma­jor trad­ing part­ners eased virus curbs.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Kospi stock in­dex hit its all-time high yes­ter­day for a dra­matic gain of 83 per cent from its low this year – soon af­ter the pan­demic hit in late March – as au­thor­i­ties cut in­ter­est rates and poured money into the fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But the re­vival of fi­nan­cial as­set prices has had lit­tle spillover into the real econ­omy, as own­ers of small busi­nesses and street shops shut down amid new re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“I’m plan­ning to launch a take­out wine sale with dis­counts, which is the only way to head off a cash crunch, given rev­enue drops through­out the year,” said a wine bar owner, who runs two stores in down­town Seoul, and asked to be iden­ti­fied only by her sur­name, Kim. She said she had bought sup­plies worth 10 mil­lion won (S$12,100) i n ex­pec­ta­tion of a surge in year-end reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>The usual bustling ac­tiv­ity and long queues in many shop­ping streets and nightlife ar­eas in Seoul were miss­ing on Mon­day evening.</p>
    <p>With­out gov­ern­ment help, said Ms Jung, it would al­most be eas­ier to shut per­ma­nently than try to stay open un­der the new curbs, af­ter large losses in­curred in the year’s ear­lier out­breaks.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has yet to pro­pose a new round of stim­u­lus mea­sures, but yes­ter­day, the main op­po­si­tion party called for bil­lions of dol­lars to be di­verted from next year’s bud­get pro­posal as sub­si­dies for those hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties have warned the cur­rent wave of in­fec­tions might be harder to limit than be­fore, as most oc­curred in the wider com­mu­nity around Seoul.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple voiced frus­tra­tion and dis­ap­point­ment at the lat­est rules, but many also sup­ported stronger ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is sti­fling, and so sad that we have to take risks just go­ing out­side and meet­ing some­one, but it’s the right thing to do and hope­fully we’ll be able to go back to nor­mal soon,” said univer­sity stu­dent Shin Jong-hyun, 29.</p>
    <p>FEAR OF A CASH CRUNCH</p>
    <p>I’m plan­ning to launch a take­out wine sale with dis­counts, which is the only way to head off a cash crunch, given rev­enue drops through­out the year.</p>
