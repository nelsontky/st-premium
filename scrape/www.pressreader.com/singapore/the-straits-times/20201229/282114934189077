    <p>When she heard a scream and saw blood on the walk­way as she was leav­ing The Cen­tral @ Clarke Quay on Dec 19, Ms Nurly­dia Ab­dul Razak had only one thought.</p>
    <p>A woman was ly­ing in­jured on a nearby walk­way after a brawl in­volv­ing more than 10 peo­ple, and the nurse knew she needed to step for­ward and help.</p>
    <p>What she did not ex­pect was for videos of her at the scene to go vi­ral, with fam­ily, friends and even col­leagues ask­ing her if she was in­volved in the al­ter­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>So far, 12 peo­ple have been charged over their al­leged in­volve­ment in the brawl, which hap­pened at around 10.35pm out­side The Tipsy Cow bar and bistro at 6 Eu Tong Sen Street.</p>
    <p>Three peo­ple were in­jured in the fight, in­clud­ing a woman, 27, and her male com­pan­ion, 36.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The New Pa­per on Tues­day last week, Ms Nurly­dia, 30, a mother of two young chil­dren, said she, her hus­band and some friends were cel­e­brat­ing a birth­day at The Tipsy Cow when they heard the com­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>They l eft as quickly as they could, but as they were walk­ing away, they heard screams.</p>
    <p>Ms Nurly­dia’s friend’s sis­ter-in­law was also a nurse and they rushed over.</p>
    <p>Ms Nurly­dia said: “Out of fear (that the brawlers were still there or would return), an­other friend told me not to go. I said we have to help – if not, why did we be­come nurses? If I walked away, I wouldn’t feel good.”</p>
    <p>She said the in­jured woman was bleed­ing from a wound on her right arm, so the nurses el­e­vated the arm and used a shirt to stop the bleed­ing. They kept ask­ing her ques­tions as the woman was slip­ping in and out of con­scious­ness.</p>
    <p>“She said she had just got­ten mar­ried,” Ms Nurly­dia added.</p>
    <p>She said the woman’s hus­band was stand­ing, so no one re­alised he was also hurt un­til he sud­denly lay down.</p>
    <p>“It was so dark and he was wear­ing black. But his shirt was drenched i n blood. When the paramedics came, we told them to at­tend to him first,” she said.</p>
    <p>Even with five years of ex­pe­ri­ence as a nurse, in­clud­ing some time in op­er­at­ing the­atres, deal­ing with the af­ter­math of the brawl was a first for Ms Nurly­dia.</p>
    <p>“It was quite scary. It was the first time I had so much blood on me. Even the next day, I felt like I could still smell it.”</p>
    <p>Shortly after the in­ci­dent, peo­ple started call­ing and send­ing her vi­ral videos, in which she could be seen shout­ing at her friends to move away as they were telling her to leave the scene.</p>
    <p>She said: “At work, some of my col­leagues saw the video and asked me about it. That was why I de­cided to in­form my su­per­vi­sor. Even my nieces and neph­ews saw the video on TikTok.</p>
    <p>“It was so em­bar­rass­ing.”</p>
    <p>But when asked if she would step for­ward again, Ms Nurly­dia was un­equiv­o­cal.</p>
    <p>“Even if I am (no longer) a nurse, I would still help... but next time I won’t shout.”</p>
