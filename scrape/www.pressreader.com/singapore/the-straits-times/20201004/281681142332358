    <p>NEW DELHI In­dia’s death toll from the coro­n­avirus rose past 100,000 yes­ter­day, only the third coun­try in the world to reach that bleak mile­stone, after the United States and Brazil, and its epi­demic shows no sign of abat­ing.</p>
    <p>To­tal deaths rose to 100,842, the Health Min­istry said, while the tally of in­fec­tions climbed to 6.47 mil­lion after a daily in­crease in cases of 79,476. In­dia now has the high­est rate of daily in­crease in in­fec­tions in the world.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s gov­ern­ment, faced with a col­laps­ing econ­omy after i mpos­ing a tough lock­down to try to stem the spread of the virus in late March, is push­ing ahead with a full re­open­ing of the coun­try. Cin­e­mas were al­lowed to re­open at half ca­pac­ity last week and the au­thor­i­ties can de­cide to re­open schools from the mid­dle of this month.</p>
    <p>Head­ing into win­ter and the hol­i­day sea­son, in­clud­ing the Hindu fes­ti­val of Deep­avali next month, the world’s sec­ond most pop­u­lous coun­try could see a jump in virus cases, health ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>“We have seen some re­cent slow­down of the virus curve but this may be a lo­cal peak; there may be an­other com­ing,” said Pro­fes­sor Bhra­mar Mukher­jee, a bio­statis­tics and epi­demi­ol­ogy ex­pert at the Univer­sity of Michi­gan.</p>
    <p>She said data showed a little over 7 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion of 1.3 bil­lion had been ex­posed to the virus, mean­ing In­dia was still far from any sort of herd im­mu­nity. The num­ber of cases could rise to 12.2 mil­lion by the end of the year but the rate of spread would de­pend on how ef­fec­tive mea­sures such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing were, she said.</p>
    <p>“So it will con­tinue like a slow burn­ing coil, that is my hope, and we have to play the long game to stop it from be­ing a wild­fire.”</p>
    <p>The US, Brazil and In­dia to­gether ac­count for nearly 45 per cent of all Covid-19 deaths glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Death rates in In­dia, how­ever, have been sig­nif­i­cantly lower than in those other two coun­tries, rais­ing ques­tions about the ac­cu­racy of its data. In­dia has, on av­er­age, less than one death from the dis­ease for ev­ery 10,000 peo­ple while the US and Brazil have seen six deaths per 10,000.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Donald Trump, de­fend­ing his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s han­dling of the pan­demic in last week’s pres­i­den­tial de­bate, said coun­tries such as In­dia were un­der-re­port­ing deaths.</p>
    <p>Mr Shashank Tri­pathi, from the Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­ease Re­search at the In­dian In­sti­tute of Sci­ence in Ben­galuru, ac­knowl­edged there could be prob­lems with the data, although In­dia’s young pop­u­la­tion might help ex­plain the lower death rate.</p>
    <p>“In In­dia, even with­out a pan­demic, all deaths are not prop­erly reg­is­tered,” Mr Tri­pathi said.</p>
    <p>“I’m not very con­fi­dent that the mor­tal­ity rates re­flect the right num­bers, though the younger de­mo­graphic has given us some advantage.”</p>
