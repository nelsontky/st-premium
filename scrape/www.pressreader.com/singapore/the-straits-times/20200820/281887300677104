    <p>BEI­JING • China’s lat­est anti-cor­rup­tion cam­paign ap­pears to be pick­ing up speed, after Shang­hai’s po­lice chief be­came the lat­est se­nior law en­force­ment of­fi­cial tar­geted by in­ves­ti­ga­tors.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai Public Se­cu­rity di­rec­tor Gong Daoan, who also serves as a vice-mayor of the east­ern fi­nan­cial cen­tre, was be­ing in­ves­ti­gated over sus­pected se­ri­ous vi­o­la­tions of party dis­ci­pline and the law, Xinhua news agency said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Gong is the third se­nior po­lice of­fi­cial placed un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion by anti-cor­rup­tion au­thor­i­ties this year, fol­low­ing cases against a vice-min­is­ter of public se­cu­rity and the po­lice chief in the south­west­ern metropo­lis of Chongqing.</p>
    <p>The probes are among dozens launched since Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping be­gan his lat­est cam­paign to purge cor­rup­tion – this time fo­cused on the na­tion’s vast law en­force­ment ap­pa­ra­tus.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Cen­tral Po­lit­i­cal and Le­gal Af­fairs Com­mis­sion, the party body that over­sees the coun­try’s po­lice, prose­cu­tors and courts, an­nounced an “ed­u­ca­tion and rec­ti­fi­ca­tion” cam­paign to</p>
    <p>“thor­oughly re­move tu­mours” from the jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Such cam­paigns have be­come an en­dur­ing fea­ture of Mr Xi’s al­most eight-year ten­ure as China’s top leader, with more than three mil­lion cadres en­snared in cor­rup­tion probes as of Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ef­fort comes as Mr Xi pre­pares for a twice-a-decade party congress in 2022, which is ex­pected to de­cide whether he stays on for a third five-year term.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen Yixin, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the po­lit­i­cal and le­gal com­mis­sion, com­pared the cam­paign – set to last through 2022 – with a po­lit­i­cal purge that con­sol­i­dated Mao Ze­dong’s para­mount po­si­tion more than 75 years ago.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Chen said the cam­paign had en­tered its se­cond phase, warn­ing cadres in Bei­jing to be ready for “self-ex­am­i­na­tion” and “self-cor­rec­tion”, ac­cord­ing to an ar­ti­cle on the com­mis­sion’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The dozens of in­ves­ti­ga­tions an­nounced in the first weeks of the cam­paign were “only a pre­lude” of what is to come, the Shang­hai Ob­server news site re­ported last month.</p>
