    <p>DUBLIN (Ohio) • It was dad to the res­cue in the third round of the Me­mo­rial tour­na­ment on Satur­day when Mike Thomas picked up son Justin’s bag after his cad­die fell ill on a steamy, hot day at Muir­field Vil­lage Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio.</p>
    <p>With no spec­ta­tors at the PGA Tour event be­cause of Covid-19 health and safety reg­u­la­tions, the world No. 3 had few op­tions when reg­u­lar bag man Jimmy John­son be­gan feel­ing dizzy.</p>
    <p>After hit­ting his tee shot on the 13th, Thomas said he turned around and there was his fa­ther on his bag.</p>
    <p>“I told him (John­son) on No. 12 that if he needed to leave, he needed to leave,” said the Amer­i­can. “Just to make sure that he’s okay ver­sus both of us wor­ry­ing about it out there, and I hit my tee shot and I came out and Jimmy was gone and my dad was there.”</p>
    <p>After tak­ing a dou­ble-bo­gey at the par-three 12th, dad brought Justin a boost and he hit back with a birdie at the par-four 13th.</p>
    <p>But Mike, who is also Justin’s swing coach, could do lit­tle as the 27-year-old went bo­gey, dou­ble-bo­gey, bo­gey from the par-five 15th be­fore sign­ing off with a birdie at the par-four last for a three-over 75.</p>
    <p>“It was fine,” said Thomas with a shrug after a per­for­mance that left him on even-par 216 go­ing into the fi­nal round, 12 shots be­hind leader Jon Rahm.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t make those bo­geys be­cause my dad was cad­dy­ing, it was just poor ex­e­cu­tion. But yeah, I mean, in a cou­ple of weeks or one day, no­body will re­mem­ber it. But right now, yeah, it’s a bum­mer.”</p>
    <p>The lat­est Jack Nick­laus-hosted event might be one golfers will be keen to for­get.</p>
    <p>Muir­field Vil­lage has pro­vided such a chal­lenge that Thomas said it felt like the year’s first Ma­jor. That was ar­guably fit­ting as it was sup­posed to be The Open Cham­pi­onship week.</p>
    <p>A com­bi­na­tion of strong winds of over 40kmh and tem­per­a­tures of around 40 deg C has en­sured the 7,456-yard lay­out was not its usual lush green.</p>
    <p>“The greens are get­ting pur­ple,” Kevin Na (71) told Ya­hoo Sports. “I mean, down­wind to a front pin, you have no chance. Some­times 30 feet was the best you could do, and you just make par and move on.”</p>
    <p>The scor­ing av­er­age after three rounds was 73.58. Rahm, who could be­come the world No. 1 for the first time in his ca­reer to­day if he wins and Rory McIl­roy (72) – joint-12th – fin­ishes worse than a tie for sec­ond, said he played one of the best rounds of his life to post a 68.</p>
    <p>And the Spa­niard, four strokes ahead of near­est ri­vals Tony Finau (73) and Ryan Palmer (73), sug­gested that scratch am­a­teurs should be al­lowed in to get a feel of how tough the course is.</p>
    <p>“Cut the greens, make sure they’re the same speed, flags in the same spots, just for peo­ple to see. We were think­ing the club cham­pion – the scratch club cham­pion – might not break 80 here to­day. It’s that dif­fi­cult a course,” he said, be­fore amend­ing his pre­dic­tion to “break­ing 90”.</p>
    <p>At least for Rahm, the only player who was dou­ble dig­its un­der par after 54 holes, the Me­mo­rial could end up be­ing mem­o­rable.</p>
