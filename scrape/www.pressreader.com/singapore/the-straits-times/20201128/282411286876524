    <p>While tech­nol­ogy has made faster money trans­fers pos­si­ble, it has also fa­cil­i­tated scam­mers in car­ry­ing out fraud­u­lent trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>In the first six months of this year, $102 mil­lion was lost to var­i­ous scams.</p>
    <p>Bank-re­lated phish­ing scams are of par­tic­u­lar con­cern as the num­ber of cases surged more than twen­ty­fold to 898 in the first half of this year, from just 34 in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The to­tal amount lost rose to $3.6 mil­lion in the first half of this year, from $93,000 for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Both cus­tomers and banks have a duty not to fa­cil­i­tate fraud on the cus­tomers’ bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times spoke to lawyer Steven Lam of Tem­plars Law, banks, the po­lice, the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) and the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore to find out the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and ex­tent of li­a­bil­ity of cus­tomers and banks.</p>
    <p>Q Say I re­ceived a call from a scam­mer who claimed to be from my tele­coms provider and of­fered to help me re­solve my In­ter­net is­sues. I was tricked into giv­ing him re­mote ac­cess to my lap­top and also ac­cess to my bank ac­counts. When I re­alised that some­thing was amiss, I hung up and im­me­di­ately re­ported the in­ci­dent to the bank. Can the bank stop the fund trans­fer by the scam­mer?</p>
    <p>A Un­likely, be­cause most fund trans­fers are car­ried out in­stantly.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of group cor­po­rate se­cu­rity Fran­cisco Ce­lio said: “When trans­ac­tions are au­tho­rised by our cus­tomers via on­line bank­ing, though at times fraud­u­lently through scam­mers, the trans­ac­tions will be pro­cessed al­most im­me­di­ately. There­fore, it is of­ten dif­fi­cult to stop the trans­fer.</p>
    <p>While we will as­sist our cus­tomers to promptly sub­mit a fund re­call as soon as OCBC is alerted to the trans­ac­tion, our abil­ity to re­call the funds is de­pen­dent on the re­sponse of the re­ceiv­ing bank.”</p>
    <p>Q If banks can­not sus­pend the fraud­u­lent trans­ac­tion, why do I need to alert the bank im­me­di­ately when I re­alise that I have been scammed?</p>
    <p>A Bank staff can im­me­di­ately dis­able your on­line bank­ing ac­cess and cards to pre­vent scam­mers from car­ry­ing out fur­ther fraud­u­lent trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Q If the fraud­u­lent fund trans­fer is not im­me­di­ate and takes two to three business days to com­plete, can my bank stop the trans­ac­tion?</p>
    <p>A Tech­ni­cally, once an in­struc­tion is given, the funds will be deb­ited from your ac­count. Even though it has not reached the re­cip­i­ent’s bank, it has ef­fec­tively left yours.</p>
    <p>The funds could be trans­ferred to an in­terim bank be­fore reach­ing the re­cip­i­ent’s bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>It would be dif­fi­cult to in­ter­cept the trans­ac­tion as the in­terim bank has an obli­ga­tion to pass the funds to the re­cip­i­ent’s bank.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Can the Sin­ga­pore po­lice help me re­cover my funds?</p>
    <p>A Yes, if the funds are trans­ferred to a lo­cal ben­e­fi­ciary bank ac­count and the funds are still re­sid­ing within that bank ac­count. The po­lice can is­sue an or­der to freeze the</p>
    <p>ben­e­fi­ciary ac­count to pre­vent any dis­si­pa­tion of funds.</p>
    <p>Upon com­ple­tion of in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the po­lice will seek a court or­der for the funds to be re­turned to the right­ful owner.</p>
    <p>Q Can the Sin­ga­pore po­lice help me re­cover my funds trans­ferred to an over­seas bank?</p>
    <p>A The chances of re­cov­ery are of­ten slim, even though the po­lice will work with in­ter­na­tional part­ners to trace the money.</p>
    <p>Q If I re­port an unau­tho­rised trans­ac­tion to my bank, when can I ex­pect a res­o­lu­tion?</p>
    <p>A Your bank should com­plete an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of any rel­e­vant claim within 21 business days for straight­for­ward cases, and up to 45 business days for com­plex cases.</p>
    <p>Q Sup­pose I re­ceived a call from a scam­mer who claimed to be a bank em­ployee. He in­structed me to log in to my bank ac­count and tricked me into mak­ing a fund trans­fer to an­other bank ac­count. Does my bank have a duty to re­cover the funds for me?</p>
    <p>A The bank’s li­a­bil­ity will de­pend on whether the trans­fer hap­pened as a re­sult of the bank cus­tomer’s neg­li­gence, said Mr Lam.</p>
    <p>“In this case, the neg­li­gence is on the part of the bank ac­count holder. Con­trac­tu­ally, the bank doesn’t have to bother.</p>
    <p>“But most banks will still try their best to re­cover the funds for the ac­count holder.”</p>
    <p>MAS said con­sumers are gen­er­ally li­able for losses from trans­ac­tions that they had au­tho­rised, even if they sub­se­quently find out that they had been tricked into do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Q If my bank ac­count was hacked and my sav­ings were de­pleted, do I have to bear the losses?</p>
    <p>A Yes, if it is as­cer­tained that the pri­mary cause was reck­less­ness on your part, such as fail­ing to pro­tect your ac­cess code.</p>
    <p>But if it is proven that the se­cu­rity breach is on the bank’s part, the bank would usu­ally bear the losses, said Mr Lam.</p>
    <p>Q What is the bank’s duty of care to me?</p>
    <p>A A bank’s duty of care is con­trac­tual in na­ture. A lot of duty is im­posed on the cus­tomer.</p>
    <p>MAS has is­sued e-pay­ment guide­lines to pro­tect users of elec­tronic pay­ments.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines set out the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of banks.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, banks are ex­pected to pro­vide real-time trans­ac­tion no­ti­fi­ca­tions and a re­port­ing chan­nel, so that you may be alerted to unau­tho­rised trans­ac­tions and re­port them should they hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Bank cus­tomers would also need to take rea­son­able steps to pro­tect their own in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>These in­clude adopt­ing good se­cu­rity prac­tices such as pro­tect­ing your de­vice, log-in cre­den­tials and ac­cess codes.</p>
