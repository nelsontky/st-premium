    <p>Smok­ers seem sprin­kled with fairy dust made from the ashes of non-smok­ers’ dreams about good health; they are al­lowed to puff cig­a­rettes at home even though the smoke harms neigh­bours. They can also be outdoors with their masks off to puff away.</p>
    <p>We non-smok­ers, hav­ing no spe­cial hob­bies which in­volve in­hal­ing smoke, can­not pull our masks down for the equiv­a­lent... oh, let’s call them “breath breaks”.</p>
    <p>WE KEEP MASKS ON WHILE THEY DON’T</p>
    <p>We have to re­main masked out­side our homes lest we spread pos­si­ble virus-laden droplets.</p>
    <p>Yet, smok­ers can blow out air laced with ar­senic, ben­zene, formalde­hyde and many more car­cino­gens – never mind pos­si­ble coro­n­avirus-laden droplets.</p>
    <p>Too bad, asth­matic chil­dren and grannies hur­ry­ing through the nox­ious haze.</p>
    <p>Too bad, too, for peo­ple stand­ing or walk­ing 10m from smok­ers, never mind the 5m rule. Smok­ing is pro­hib­ited within a 5m ra­dius of bus stops.</p>
    <p>Sorry, non-smok­ers, breath­ing fresh air is over­rated. It is not a spe­cial hobby or an es­sen­tial ac­tiv­ity. It is not up there with eat­ing or drinking, jog­ging, bik­ing or ex­er­cis­ing stren­u­ously when masks need not be worn.</p>
    <p>And, of course, there are also non-smok­ers who are seen am­bling, stand­ing or sit­ting with their masks off – un­til they spot a safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador. But for months and months, the rest of us have qui­etly re­mained masked for the greater good.</p>
    <p>And, through it all, the smok­ers get to stand there wreathed in smoke, with their masks off and mouths open, ex­hal­ing with ex­quis­ite sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>WE KEEP WIN­DOWS SHUT WHILE THEY DON’T</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, some peo­ple with some power opened their mouths to speak up for us.</p>
    <p>Last month, a Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee (GPC) called for a ban on res­i­dents smok­ing near win­dows or on the bal­conies of their homes to min­imise the ef­fects of sec­ond-hand smoke on neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment Louis Ng said the pro­posed ban will em­power Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency of­fi­cers to en­force what is cur­rently an ad­vi­sory for res­i­dents not to smoke near win­dows and on bal­conies.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties re­sponded, say­ing that such leg­is­la­tion would be “highly in­tru­sive”, “ex­ac­er­bate ex­ist­ing con­cerns about pri­vacy and in­fring­ing the owner’s rights to his or her own pri­vate space”, and that there would be sig­nif­i­cant prac­ti­cal chal­lenges in en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who chairs the GPC for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, noted that 383 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore died due to sec­ond-hand smoke in 2016.</p>
    <p>“That is about one per­son dy­ing every day. We must do some­thing,” he said in Par­lia­ment then.</p>
    <p>He re­counted how one res­i­dent, who lives with her el­derly par­ents, would wake up in the mid­dle of the night to close the win­dows, so her par­ents did not in­hale sec­ond-hand smoke. But this meant no ven­ti­la­tion while they were sleep­ing.</p>
    <p>Come. Add your sto­ries on the bon­fire, so some­one can see our smoke sig­nal for help.</p>
    <p>Here’s mine:</p>
    <p>In the morn­ing, a res­i­dent kindly gives my neigh­bour­hood a loud warn­ing that he is on the verge of smok­ing by retch­ing and spit­ting to clear his lungs out. There’s noth­ing wrong with be­ing nois­ily un­well, of course. But he promptly re­fills his lungs with phlegm by smok­ing and cough­ing gen­er­ously on the bal­cony.</p>
    <p>Then he retches down the sink again.</p>
    <p>While there’s noth­ing wrong with him be­ing nois­ily un­well, the worry is that it could be us sec­ond-hand smoke vic­tims retch­ing into the sink one day.</p>
    <p>Through­out the day, he is less gen­er­ous with the warn­ings of when he wishes to smoke. It could be a lunch smoke. Mid-af­ter­noon or after-din­ner smoke? Sup­per sur­prise smoke. After-mid­night smoke.</p>
    <p>In a world where we are al­ready con­tend­ing with fumes from ve­hi­cles, the oc­ca­sional dread­ful trans­bound­ary haze and other pol­lu­tants in the air, we could re­ally do with­out this do­mes­tic haze called sec­ond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>Leave the win­dows open at your own risk.</p>
    <p>WE KEEP MOUTHS SHUT AS THERE’S NO LAW</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said that of the 11,400 smok­ing com­plaints re­ceived in the first four months of 2020, 58 per cent were in res­i­den­tial es­tates, and of th­ese, only 5 per cent in­volved smok­ing in homes.</p>
    <p>This may not be an ac­cu­rate pic­ture of the sit­u­a­tion, spec­u­lated Straits Times Fo­rum writer Liu</p>
    <p>I-Chun, who wrote: “Peo­ple are not re­port­ing smok­ing in homes sim­ply be­cause it is not against the law, and the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties have re­peat­edly told them so. There­fore, most are of the view that it is point­less to com­plain, al­though they re­main dis­traught.”</p>
    <p>Put that in your pipe and smoke it.</p>
    <p>Do what­ever you want in the pri­vacy of your own home, but it’s not okay to let, for ex­am­ple, dirty water flow from your win­dow or bal­cony into neigh­bours’ homes. But some­how, it’s okay for dirty air to flow from smok­ers’ flats into neigh­bours’ homes.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant prac­ti­cal chal­lenges in en­force­ment? True.</p>
    <p>WE KEEP TRY­ING</p>
    <p>Con­sider a two-tier pric­ing sys­tem for the pay­ment of con­ser­vancy and other fees, Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Pro­fes­sor Eus­ton Quah sug­gested in a Straits Times com­men­tary.</p>
    <p>“The hous­ing man­age­ment, or Hous­ing Board, may con­sider re­quir­ing a house­hold dec­la­ra­tion of whether there are smok­ers.</p>
    <p>That in­for­ma­tion is stored and house­holds with smok­ers will be re­quired to pay a higher con­ser­vancy and fee charge,” he wrote re­cently.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant prac­ti­cal chal­lenges in en­force­ment? True again.</p>
    <p>Con­sider spe­cial air­tight rooms or huts with ven­ti­la­tion sys­tems that smok­ers must use whether in­side or out­side of homes for a puff.</p>
    <p>We al­ready have des­ig­nated open-air ar­eas for smok­ing, which are part of the many smok­ing-re­duc­tion mea­sures the au­thor­i­ties have put in place over many years. But do mark­ings on the ground or walls with gaps con­fine the smoke?</p>
    <p>If you think air­tight rooms are cruel, then look at non-smok­ers work­ing and sleep­ing in such rooms at home to keep the smoke out.</p>
    <p>If you think air­tight rooms are odd, then look, for ex­am­ple, at loos. Grown-ups and potty-trained chil­dren can’t just pee any­where. They have to hold it in un­til they get to spe­cial en­closed rooms with a sys­tem of pipes – loos – to re­lieve them­selves.</p>
    <p>Think of smok­ing in the same way: Waste prod­ucts are about to come out of the body, so smok­ers should hold off on their spe­cial hobby un­til they get to a place that can han­dle their gaseous body waste. Dis­charge it with­out harm­ing the public.</p>
    <p>Back in the day, hu­mans used to pee and poop wher­ever they felt the urge. Then we evolved for the greater good.</p>
    <p>We al­ready have des­ig­nated open-air ar­eas for smok­ing, which are part of the many smok­ing-re­duc­tion mea­sures the au­thor­i­ties have put in place over many years. But do mark­ings on the ground or walls with gaps con­fine the smoke? If you think air­tight rooms are cruel, then look at non-smok­ers work­ing and sleep­ing in such rooms at home to keep the smoke out.</p>
