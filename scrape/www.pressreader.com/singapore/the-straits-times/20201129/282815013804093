    <p>Jur­gen Klopp was frus­trated after a late Pas­cal Gross penalty forced Liver­pool to set­tle for a 1-1 Premier League draw at Brighton yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But, for once, he ad­mit­ted that “the de­ci­sions were right” by the VAR (video as­sis­tant ref­eree).</p>
    <p>A Diogo Jota goal looked to have se­cured a win for Klopp’s side, but Gross drilled home his spot kick in stop­page time after a pitch­side mon­i­tor re­view saw Andy Robert­son pun­ished for kick­ing the foot of Danny Wel­beck.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool had ear­lier seen two goals ruled out by VAR.</p>
    <p>The de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons still moved a point clear at the top of the ta­ble with 21 points from 10 games while sec­ond-placed Tot­ten­ham, who play at Chelsea today, have 20 points from nine.</p>
    <p>“The penalty, it is how it is. I think the de­ci­sions were right, yes,” Klopp said on BT Sport.</p>
    <p>“In foot­ball, you need al­ways a lit­tle bit of luck to win a tough away game. Today we didn’t have luck.”</p>
    <p>He added of the two goals ruled out for off­side against Mo­hamed Salah and Sa­dio Mane: “We are used to armpits (be­ing off­side), and club badges, so if it’s a toe then it’s ob­vi­ously off­side. And the other one with Sa­dio was clear.”</p>
    <p>Aaron Con­nolly wasted a great chance to put Brighton ahead in the 10th minute when he was put through clear on goal by Neal Maupay. But, with only Alis­son Becker to beat, he placed his shot wide.</p>
    <p>The hosts had an even bet­ter chance 10 min­utes later when Liver­pool right-back Nico Wil­liams brought down Con­nolly, but Maupay put his penalty kick well wide.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing had those two let-offs, Liver­pool thought they had taken the lead when Roberto Firmino fed Salah, who burst goal­wards and poked the ball past Mat Ryan. But VAR ruled the Egyp­tian had been in an off­side po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The open­ing goal came on the hour when Robert­son fed Salah, who laid off to Jota who, in turn, veered across the top of the penalty area, cre­at­ing space for a low shot which he squeezed into the bot­tom cor­ner.</p>
    <p>It was his ninth goal of the sea­son in 14 ap­pear­ances in all com­pe­ti­tions, in­clud­ing eight in his last eight games for the Reds.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool, who face Ajax in the Cham­pi­ons League on Tues­day, suf­fered a blow when James Mil­ner had to go off with what ap­peared to be a ham­string in­jury.</p>
    <p>Mane then had a headed ef­fort ruled out for off­side, be­fore the late Brighton equaliser.</p>
    <p>While Klopp con­ceded Brighton’s penalty de­ci­sion was right, his skip­per Jor­dan Henderson felt ag­grieved.</p>
    <p>“It should be three points, in my opin­ion. I’ve seen the re­play. It’s not a pen,” he said. “It feels like we’re stand­ing here every week and dis­cussing in­ci­dents. I don’t want to get into trou­ble, but for me it’s not a penalty.</p>
    <p>Henderson also said Wel­beck had told him the in­ci­dent did not merit a penalty, and the Brighton striker him­self de­scribed it as a “soft penalty”.</p>
    <p>“I got there in front and nicked it around him. He kicked me and then the ball, so... the ref­eree went to see it on the screen and made his de­ci­sion,” Wel­beck said.</p>
