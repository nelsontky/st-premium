    <p>BEI­JING, HONG KONG • Elec­tric ve­hi­cle mak­ers in the cut-throat Chi­nese mar­ket face a po­ten­tially lethal mix of plum­met­ing de­mand and a Tesla of­fen­sive, prompt­ing more start-ups to see ini­tial public of­fer­ings as a way to en­sure sur­vival.</p>
    <p>Li Auto, backed by food de­liv­ery gi­ant Meituan Dian­ping, has launched an ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO) of up to US$950 mil­lion (S$1.3 bil­lion), in one of the big­gest US list­ings by Chi­nese com­pa­nies this year.</p>
    <p>The five-year-old maker of pre­mium elec­tric sport util­ity ve­hi­cles (SUVs) is sell­ing 95 mil­lion Amer­i­can de­posi­tary shares at an in­dica­tive range of US$8 to US$10 a share, ac­cord­ing to its up­dated prospec­tus filed with the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It is set to price the float on Thurs­day and be­gin trad­ing on the Nas­daq under the sym­bol “Li” the next day.</p>
    <p>Also last Fri­day, Ho­zon New En­ergy Au­to­mo­bile be­came the lat­est con­tender to launch its IPO path, say­ing it wants one in Shang­hai as soon as next year.</p>
    <p>WM Mo­tor Tech­nol­ogy is weigh­ing an ini­tial stock sale in the same city as soon as this year, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The man­u­fac­tur­ers are vy­ing for a foothold in China’s once heav­ily sub­sidised elec­tric car sec­tor, with sev­eral be­ing squeezed out by a lack of fund­ing this year alone. But at the same time, the seem­ingly un­stop­pable mar­ket leader Tesla and one of its more es­tab­lished Chi­nese chal­lengers, NIO, have gained buy­ers in a po­ten­tial sign of longterm strength for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“The strength in Tesla and NIO shares is cre­at­ing a win­dow for new elec­tric ve­hi­cle start-ups to list,” said Mr Robert Cow­ell, an an­a­lyst at Shang­hai-based pri­vate eq­uity firm 86Re­search.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent con­di­tions pro­vide an at­trac­tive op­por­tu­nity to raise funds, which can help some of th­ese smaller start-ups sus­tain the in­vest­ments nec­es­sary to com­pete ef­fec­tively.”</p>
    <p>Shares of Tesla and NIO have more than tre­bled this year, even as the broader Chi­nese elec­tric ve­hi­cle mar­ket has been shrink­ing.</p>
    <p>Wealth­ier buy­ers are drawn to the com­pa­nies’ pre­mium ve­hi­cles, while the govern­ment’s sub­sidy re­duc­tions and the coronaviru­s pan­demic have hurt de­mand for cheaper mod­els.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of Chi­nese elec­tric car hope­fuls runs into the hun­dreds, a smaller group of po­ten­tial sur­vivors is start­ing to emerge. Just 11 suc­ceeded in rais­ing funds last year, among them WM Mo­tor, Li Auto and Ho­zon, ac­cord­ing to strat­egy and in­vest­ment ad­vi­sory firm Au­to­mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>WM Mo­tor, based in Shang­hai, is ex­pected to seek an of­fer­ing that would value it at over 30 bil­lion yuan (S$6 bil­lion), the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>A com­pany rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2015, WM Mo­tor has back­ers in­clud­ing tech­nol­ogy pow­er­houses Baidu and Ten­cent Hold­ings. It re­cently de­liv­ered its 30,000th EX5 SUV, the com­pany an­nounced this month.</p>
    <p>Zhe­jiang-based Ho­zon is bank­ing on fu­ture growth po­ten­tial for more af­ford­able elec­tric ve­hi­cles in ru­ral ar­eas, with its first model, an SUV, start­ing at less than US$10,000.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ies of Ho­zon’s sec­ond model started last month, and in to­tal the com­pany has shipped more than 16,000 ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The car­maker wants to raise 3 bil­lion yuan in Se­ries C fi­nanc­ing on the way to the planned IPO, it said last Fri­day. The com­pany com­pleted a Se­ries B fund-rais­ing of a sim­i­lar amount last year.</p>
    <p>As for Li Auto, along­side its IPO, it will also raise US$380 mil­lion from a con­cur­rent pri­vate place­ment of shares to in­vestors. It plans to use most of the pro­ceeds raised for cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­tures as well as re­search and de­vel­op­ment of new prod­ucts. It is build­ing Li ONE ex­tended-range elec­tric SUVs in China and de­liv­ered 6,604 of the model in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“This in­dus­try by na­ture re­quires huge in­vest­ment in prod­uct de­vel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing,” said Mr Charley Xu, man­ag­ing direc­tor and part­ner at Bos­ton Con­sult­ing Group i n Shang­hai. “Fi­nanc­ing from the public mar­ket can fur­ther boost its de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
