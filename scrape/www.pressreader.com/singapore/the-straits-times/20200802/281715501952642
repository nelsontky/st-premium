    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Amer­ica’s top in­fec­tious dis­eases of­fi­cial An­thony Fauci has raised con­cerns over the safety of Covid-19 vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped by China and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Chi­nese com­pa­nies are at the fore­front of the race to de­velop an im­mu­nity to the dis­ease, and Rus­sia plans to start mass vac­ci­na­tions in Oc­to­ber with health work­ers and teach­ers first in line to get the in­oc­u­la­tion against the dis­ease, according to its Health Min­is­ter Mikhail Murashko.</p>
    <p>A drug de­vel­oped by Moscow’s Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute and the Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund has com­pleted clin­i­cal tri­als and the au­thor­i­ties are pre­par­ing to reg­is­ter it with reg­u­la­tors, Mr Murashko was quoted as say­ing by the staterun Tass news ser­vice.</p>
    <p>But Dr Fauci said it is un­likely that the United States would use any vac­cine de­vel­oped in ei­ther country, where reg­u­la­tory sys­tems are far more opaque than they are in the West.</p>
    <p>“I do hope that the Chi­nese and the Rus­sians are ac­tu­ally test­ing the vac­cine before they are ad­min­is­ter­ing the vac­cine to any­one,” he told a US con­gres­sional hear­ing last Fri­day. “Claims of hav­ing a vac­cine ready to dis­trib­ute before you do test­ing, I think, is prob­lem­atic, at best.”</p>
    <p>As part of its own “Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed”, the US gov­ern­ment will pay phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ants Sanofi and GSK up to US$2.1 bil­lion (S$2.9 bil­lion) to de­velop a vac­cine, the com­pa­nies said.</p>
    <p>Last month, Chi­nese me­dia an­nounced that a coron­avirus vac­cine de­vel­oped by CanSino Bi­o­log­ics was be­ing used to im­mu­nise the Chi­nese mil­i­tary – mak­ing it the first ap­proved for peo­ple, al­beit in a lim­ited pop­u­la­tion. Many sci­en­tists have raised eth­i­cal con­cerns be­cause the vac­cine has not yet be­gun its fi­nal stages of test­ing.</p>
    <p>Two other Chi­nese com­pa­nies, Si­no­vac and Sinopharm, have launched fi­nal phase three tri­als in Brazil and the United Arab Emi­rates, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Three Western coron­avirus vac­cines are in fi­nal phase three tri­als.</p>
    <p>One is pro­duced by US biotech firm Moderna and the Na­tional In­sti­tutes for Health; one by the Uni­ver­sity of Ox­ford and Britain’s As­traZeneca; and the last by Ger­many’s BioN­Tech with US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Pfizer.</p>
