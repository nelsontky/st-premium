    <p>Quar­an­tine re­stric­tions i n the Philip­pine cap­i­tal Manila and five other ur­ban cen­tres will stay till at least Oct 31, as the govern­ment heeds ex­perts who warn that re­open­ing the coun­try too early may lead to a surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions by Christ­mas time.</p>
    <p>The rest of the coun­try will be un­der a less re­stric­tive “mod­i­fied gen­eral com­mu­nity quar­an­tine” (MGCQ), Health Sec­re­tary Fran­cisco Duque an­nounced dur­ing a meet­ing late on Mon­day with Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines has re­ported fewer Covid-19 cases so far this month, at around 86,000, com­pared to last month which saw over 130,000 cases. It still has the high­est num­ber of in­fec­tions in South­east Asia, with a to­tal ex­ceed­ing 300,000, though ac­tive cases are down to around 49,000.</p>
    <p>Data crunch­ers and health ex­perts at the state-run Univer­sity of the Philip­pines said in­di­ca­tors had so far been en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Just half of the hos­pi­tal beds set aside for Covid-19 pa­tients in the cap­i­tal are now oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>But th­ese numbers still fall short of what is needed for re­stric­tions in Metro Manila – home to some 16 mil­lion – to be re­laxed fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Maria Rosario Vergeire yesterday said there were still some clus­ters around the cap­i­tal that were a source of con­cern.</p>
    <p>“If we can re­duce the num­ber of this clus­ter­ing of cases… then we can be able to say that we can maybe shift to MGCQ,” she told ABS-CBN News Channel.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts said that while the time it took for cases to dou­ble had im­proved to 13 days from 1.55 in March, it still fell short of the 28 days the govern­ment was aim­ing for be­fore it could fur­ther ease curbs on public trans­port, work pro­to­cols and recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Based on past data and trends, a pre­ma­ture down­grad­ing of the quar­an­tine sta­tus may in­crease the risk of a surge in De­cem­ber, around Christ­mas time,” they warned.</p>
    <p>They said at the cur­rent rate of in­fec­tions, and with the ex­ist­ing re­stric­tions, Covid-19 cases could still reach 400,000 by year’s end.</p>
    <p>Trade Sec­re­tary Ra­mon Lopez, who is press­ing for a faster pace of re­open­ing, said: “I un­der­stand it is not a pop­u­lar ap­peal, es­pe­cially to health work­ers. But what we are try­ing to guar­an­tee is, if we keep the en­force­ment still strict and min­i­mum health stan­dards are in place, I believe we can safely re­open it. It’s been six months, and the virus will not go away.”</p>
    <p>He added that com­pa­nies that had re­cently re­opened at half their ca­pac­ity should now be al­lowed to fully re­open. Th­ese in­clude hard­ware stores, cloth­ing shops, book­stores, banks and car show­rooms.</p>
    <p>Firms that of­fer pro­fes­sional ser­vices, such as le­gal, ad­ver­tis­ing, mar­ket­ing, pub­lish­ing and en­ter­tain­ment, should also now be oper­at­ing at 100 per cent, he said.</p>
    <p>But Metro Manila’s may­ors said that would be mov­ing too fast.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing a very sharp de­cline in the num­ber of pos­i­tive cases. We don’t want any shift in quar­an­tine sta­tus to af­fect this de­cline… We felt that this is not the right time to shift,” noted Mr Fran­cis Zamora, one of the may­ors.</p>
    <p>Most of the Philip­pines went through one of the world’s strictest and long­est lock­downs from mid-March to May.</p>
    <p>The sweep­ing lock­down was lifted in June, but that quickly led to a surge in in­fec­tions that forced Mr Duterte to again en­force a twoweek lock­down in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>That al­lowed the govern­ment to “re­boot” its pan­demic re­sponse, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Since then, more trains, buses and jeep­neys have been al­lowed to ply their routes. Also, more peo­ple have been al­lowed in malls, churches and other public venues.</p>
    <p>Gyms and other sports clubs, In­ter­net cafes and sa­lons have also re­opened.</p>
    <p>But the govern­ment is still en­forc­ing strict rules on the wear­ing of masks and face shields as well as so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
