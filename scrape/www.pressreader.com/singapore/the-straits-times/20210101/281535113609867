    <p>Sin­ga­pore should meet the new year with re­newed con­fi­dence and hope af­ter get­ting through an “ex­cep­tion­ally test­ing” 2020, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong. He said the coun­try had faced an un­prece­dented cri­sis, and sta­bilised its Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion through enor­mous ef­fort and sac­ri­fice.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore should meet the new year with re­newed con­fi­dence and hope af­ter get­ting through an “ex­cep­tion­ally test­ing” 2020, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>In his tra­di­tional New Year mes­sage yes­ter­day, PM Lee said the coun­try had faced an un­prece­dented cri­sis, and sta­bilised its Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion through enor­mous ef­fort and sac­ri­fice.</p>
    <p>“We have achieved our pri­mary ob­jec­tive to pro­tect lives and keep our peo­ple safe,” he said, not­ing that what stood out in Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 re­sponse is the trust that Sin­ga­pore­ans have in the sys­tem and one another.</p>
    <p>The coun­try en­tered phase three of its re­open­ing on Mon­day and be­gan vac­ci­nat­ing its health­care work­ers against Covid-19 two days later.</p>
    <p>“We can now see light at the end of the tun­nel,” said PM Lee, adding that Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is be­gin­ning to see signs of sta­bil­i­sa­tion as well af­ter en­ter­ing its most se­vere down­turn since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>But it will still take some time be­fore enough peo­ple are vac­ci­nated to pre­vent another ma­jor un­con­trolled out­break, he noted. In the mean­time, peo­ple have to re­main dis­ci­plined and con­tinue prac­tis­ing pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Now is not yet the time to cel­e­brate,” the Prime Min­is­ter cau­tioned. “That time will come. Mean­while, I ask for your sup­port to keep up our ef­forts and not to fal­ter in this fi­nal stretch.”</p>
    <p>On the eco­nomic front, PM Lee said em­ploy­ment has picked up, and multi­na­tional com­pa­nies are mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant new in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A Man­power Min­istry mar­ket re­port last month showed that em­ploy­ment rose among res­i­dents to near pre-Covid-19 lev­els in the third quar­ter of last year.</p>
    <p>He said the eco­nomic re­cov­ery will, how­ever, be un­even, and ac­tiv­ity is likely to re­main be­low pre­co­ro­n­avirus lev­els for some time.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent mas­sive job losses and busi­ness fail­ures, the Gov­ern­ment passed five Bud­gets, to­talling nearly $100 bil­lion, and drew heav­ily on past re­serves to fund var­i­ous sup­port schemes, he noted. He also held up the work of em­ploy­ers and unions to keep Sin­ga­pore­ans em­ployed.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 deep­ened fault lines and ten­sions in many coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore has thank­fully avoided ma­jor di­vi­sions among its peo­ple and the loss of trust that took place else­where, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Trust in the Sin­ga­pore sys­tem re­mains high, and Sin­ga­pore­ans have com­plied with Covid-19 rules be­cause the Gov­ern­ment has been open and up­front about the facts, he added.</p>
    <p>In the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion, Sin­ga­pore­ans re­newed their man­date for the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) gov­ern­ment be­cause they were con­fi­dent it could see them through the cri­sis and take the coun­try for­ward, PM Lee said. The PAP was re­turned to power at the July 10 elec­tion with 61.2 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>“My team and I will strive to con­tinue de­serv­ing your trust, to keep on strength­en­ing our so­cial com­pact, to sus­tain the promise of Sin­ga­pore as a fair and just so­ci­ety, and to help you achieve your hopes and dreams,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We are de­ter­mined to give every Sin­ga­porean equal op­por­tu­nity to do well, to pre­pare you to take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties in a different world, and to help you deal with life’s in­evitable set­backs.”</p>
    <p>He noted that while how the post-pan­demic world will look is un­cer­tain, Sin­ga­pore must emerge strength­ened by the shared ex­pe­ri­ence of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Whether Sin­ga­pore man­ages to be­come a more vi­brant econ­omy and re­silient so­ci­ety will de­pend on its peo­ple, he added.</p>
    <p>And just as how Sin­ga­pore has come to­gether to over­come the chal­lenges of the pan­demic, it must do like­wise to re­build stronger and face any new and un­ex­pected hur­dles that lie ahead, he said.</p>
    <p>“In the months and years ahead, we will face new and un­ex­pected hur­dles. Things may hap­pen that force us to change our plans. But as long as we stay to­gether as one Sin­ga­pore, I am con­fi­dent we will blaze a path for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Now, we have en­tered phase three. The first batch of vac­cines has ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore and vac­ci­na­tions have al­ready be­gun. We can now see light at the end of the tun­nel. But it will still take some time for enough peo­ple to be vac­ci­nated be­fore we are safe from another ma­jor un­con­trolled out­break.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, we must main­tain dis­ci­pline, and con­tinue with safe dis­tanc­ing and all the other pre­cau­tions that we have been tak­ing.</p>
    <p>Now is not yet the time to cel­e­brate. That time will come. Mean­while, I ask for your sup­port to keep up our ef­forts and not to fal­ter in this fi­nal stretch.</p>
    <p>2020 has been an ex­cep­tion­ally test­ing year for Sin­ga­pore. At the be­gin­ning of the year, all of us had big plans to travel, grow our busi­nesses, spend time with loved ones, get mar­ried and start a fam­ily, or grad­u­ate and take our first jobs. But soon we faced an un­prece­dented cri­sis. Covid-19 has been a re­lent­less fight that has tested our re­sources and re­solve to the fullest.</p>
    <p>Through enor­mous ef­fort and sac­ri­fice, we have sta­bilised our sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, even as the virus con­tin­ues to rage on else­where in the world. We have achieved our pri­mary ob­jec­tive to pro­tect lives and keep our peo­ple safe. We have kept our fa­tal­ity rate very low. The num­ber of new lo­cal in­fec­tions has come down to a hand­ful a day, and zero on many days.</p>
    <p>We do have im­ported cases, com­pris­ing mainly re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, as well as con­struc­tion and for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, whom we need to build new hous­ing projects and to take care of our peo­ple. These have gen­er­ally been iso­lated on stay-home no­tices, and thus pose less dan­ger of spread­ing the virus to our com­mu­nity, al­though that can still hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Now, we have en­tered phase three. The first batch of vac­cines has ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore and vac­ci­na­tions have al­ready be­gun. We can now see light at the end of the tun­nel. But it will still take some time for enough peo­ple to be vac­ci­nated be­fore we are safe from another ma­jor un­con­trolled out­break.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, we must main­tain dis­ci­pline, and con­tinue with safe dis­tanc­ing and all the other pre­cau­tions that we have been tak­ing.</p>
    <p>Now is not yet the time to cel­e­brate. That time will come. Mean­while, I ask for your sup­port to keep up our ef­forts and not to fal­ter in this fi­nal stretch.</p>
    <p>Eco­nom­i­cally, we are not yet out of the woods ei­ther, but we are be­gin­ning to see signs of sta­bil­i­sa­tion. Em­ploy­ment has picked up, and multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions are mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant new in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Af­ter our most se­vere down­turn since in­de­pen­dence, we look for­ward to a re­bound in 2021, al­though the re­cov­ery will be un­even and ac­tiv­ity is likely to re­main be­low pre-Covid-19 lev­els for some time.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has gone all out to sup­port our work­ers and com­pa­nies to pre­vent mas­sive job losses and busi­ness fail­ures. We passed five Bud­gets to­talling close to $100 bil­lion. We drew heav­ily on our past re­serves to help busi­nesses and work­ers through the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme, the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, and many other schemes. We set up new chan­nels, virtual and phys­i­cal, to help job seek­ers get matched to em­ploy­ers that were still hir­ing.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite part­ners de­serve full credit too. Em­ploy­ers did their best to keep their work­ers em­ployed, and pressed on with trans­form­ing their busi­nesses and re­design­ing jobs for their work­ers. The Na­tional Trades Union Congress and unions did their ut­most to help work­ers hold on to their jobs, learn new skills, and find new jobs if they lost their ex­ist­ing ones. We will con­tinue to make sure that in these dif­fi­cult times, Sin­ga­pore­ans get the ap­pro­pri­ate sup­port they need.</p>
    <p>What has stood out in our re­sponse to Covid-19 is the trust our peo­ple have in our sys­tem and in one another. In many coun­tries, Covid-19 has deep­ened old fault lines and cre­ated new ten­sions. Sin­ga­pore has thank­fully avoided ma­jor di­vi­sions among our peo­ple, and the pes­simism and loss of trust that have hap­pened else­where.</p>
    <p>Trust in our sys­tem re­mains high. Sin­ga­pore­ans have co­op­er­ated with the Gov­ern­ment and com­plied with the Covid-19 rules be­cause the Gov­ern­ment has been open and up­front about the facts, and jus­ti­fied your faith that it is do­ing its very best to deal with the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion, Sin­ga­pore­ans re­turned the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party gov­ern­ment to power and re­newed your man­date be­cause you were con­fi­dent that this team would see you through this cri­sis and take the coun­try for­ward.</p>
    <p>My team and I will strive to con­tinue de­serv­ing your trust, to keep on strength­en­ing our so­cial com­pact, to sus­tain the promise of Sin­ga­pore as a fair and just so­ci­ety, and to help you achieve your hopes and dreams.</p>
    <p>We are de­ter­mined to give every Sin­ga­porean equal op­por­tu­nity to do well, to pre­pare you to take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties in a different world, and to help you deal with life’s in­evitable set­backs.</p>
    <p>What the world will look like post-Covid-19 is far from cer­tain. But Sin­ga­pore must emerge strength­ened by the shared ex­pe­ri­ence of this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Whether we in­deed be­come a more vi­brant econ­omy and re­silient so­ci­ety will de­pend on us, and on the de­ci­sions that you and I make in this cri­sis and beyond.</p>
    <p>Just as we have come to­gether to over­come the chal­lenges of the pan­demic, the defin­ing cri­sis for this gen­er­a­tion, so too we must come to­gether to re­build bet­ter and stronger.</p>
    <p>A new gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans has shown we have what it takes to make our small is­land na­tion sur­vive and suc­ceed, but the fight against Covid-19 is not yet won.</p>
    <p>In the months and years ahead, we will face new and un­ex­pected hur­dles. Things may hap­pen that force us to change our plans. But as long as we stay to­gether as one Sin­ga­pore, I am con­fi­dent we will blaze a path for­ward.</p>
    <p>Let us meet 2021 with re­newed con­fi­dence and hope. I wish ev­ery­one a safe and happy new year.</p>
