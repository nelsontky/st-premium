    <p>LON­DON • An In­done­sian con artist who al­legedly im­per­son­ated top fe­male Hol­ly­wood ex­ec­u­tives to swin­dle as­pir­ing stars out of hun­dreds of thou­sands of dol­lars has been re­manded in cus­tody af­ter ap­pear­ing at a cen­tral Lon­don court.</p>
    <p>Dubbed the “Con Queen of Hol­ly­wood”, Har­gob­ind Tahilra­mani, 41, led in­ves­ti­ga­tors on a years-long global man­hunt so im­prob­a­ble that it has even been op­tioned for a book deal.</p>
    <p>Tahilra­mani, who is wanted in the United States for of­fences that in­clude wire fraud and iden­tity theft, made a two-minute ap­pear­ance at West­min­ster Mag­is­trates’ Court on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Among those he al­legedly im­per­son­ated were Lu­cas­film boss Kath­leen Kennedy, for­mer Sony movie chief Amy Pas­cal and for­mer Para­mount boss Sherry Lans­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Wendi Mur­doch, for­mer wife of me­dia ty­coon Ru­pert Mur­doch, was also al­legedly aped by the mas­ter of ac­cents.</p>
    <p>Vic­tims were ap­proached with of­fers of lu­cra­tive show­biz jobs and told to travel to In­done­sia for tasks such as lo­ca­tion scout­ing, re­search and draft­ing screen­plays, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments filed in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Tahilra­mani would “use fake ac­cents and al­ter his voice to sound like a woman”.</p>
    <p>On ar­rival, the vic­tims were al­legedly bilked for US cur­rency by Tahilra­mani and his co-con­spir­a­tors, with the promised movie projects tran­spir­ing to be en­tirely fic­tional and their ex­penses never re­im­bursed.</p>
    <p>If tar­gets com­plained or ex­pressed doubt, Tahilra­mani would some­times threaten to “dis­mem­ber” them.</p>
    <p>The scam be­gan as early as 2013 and con­tin­ued – de­spite Covid-19 travel bans – un­til Au­gust, when the vic­tims were in­stead asked to shell out for nonex­is­tent train­ing videos.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter, Tahilra­mani was ar­rested last month by po­lice in Manch­ester, Eng­land, with the as­sis­tance of pri­vate in­ves­ti­ga­tors from K2 In­tegrity.</p>
    <p>K2 co-founder Jules Kroll told Agence France-Presse that the in­ves­ti­ga­tors had helped the Amer­i­can, Bri­tish and In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties bring Tahilra­mani to jus­tice.</p>
    <p>A Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion spokesman in San Diego, Cal­i­for­nia, told AFP that Tahilra­mani had been ar­rested i n Bri­tain based on “a re­quest for his pro­vi­sional ar­rest sub­mit­ted by the United States with a view to­wards his ex­tra­di­tion”.</p>
    <p>HarperColl­ins has se­cured the book rights to the story, which will be writ­ten by for­mer Hol­ly­wood Re­porter jour­nal­ist Scott John­son.</p>
