    <p>TOKYO • In an eerie co­in­ci­dence, three Ja­panese ac­tors from the same tele­vi­sion se­rial have died in the space of two months.</p>
    <p>In the most re­cent case, Ja­panese ac­tor Takashi Fu­jiki (left), 80, was found dead at home by his son on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ja­panese me­dia, Fu­jiki left a note say­ing he had “no con­fi­dence to con­tinue act­ing” and the po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the case as sus­pected suicide.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sankei Shim­bun, Fu­jiki had been at home most of the time as his work­load had been cut dras­ti­cally due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He was plan­ning to act in a mu­si­cal in Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Fu­jiki, who joined the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try in 1959, had ap­peared in TV se­ri­als such as Shin­sen­gumi! (2004), Team Med­i­cal Dragon 4 (2014) and Ka­men Rider Ama­zons (2016 to 2017).</p>
    <p>He is the third ac­tor from the TV se­rial Bloody Mon­day 2 (2010) to die of sus­pected suicide in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Haruma Miura, 30, the lead­ing ac­tor in the se­ries, died in July, while ac­tress Sei Ashina, 36, was found dead in her Tokyo apart­ment last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, vet­eran ac­tor Yo­suke Saito has died from can­cer at the age of 69.</p>
    <p>Saito, who acted in well-known TV se­ri­als such as Oshin (1983 to 1984), was found to have la­ryn­geal can­cer af­ter a visit to the dentist in July. He died last Satur­day.</p>
