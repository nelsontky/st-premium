    <p>There’s noth­ing ar­bi­trary about an epi­demic. While each dis­ease is the prod­uct of a chain of ac­ci­den­tal ge­netic shifts, the process that turns a novel in­fec­tion into a dev­as­tat­ing out­break is as much so­cial as bi­o­log­i­cal.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of new con­di­tions will die out be­fore they spread be­yond a hand­ful of peo­ple. Only rarely will one ex­ploit the fault lines of our so­cial or­der to ram­page through the en­tire hu­man pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Epi­demic dis­eases are not ran­dom events that af­flict so­ci­eties capri­ciously and with­out warn­ing. On the con­trary, ev­ery so­ci­ety pro­duces its own spe­cific vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties,” med­i­cal his­to­rian Frank M. Snow­den wrote in his re­cent book, Epi­demics And So­ci­ety. As a re­sult, study­ing dis­ease is a way of un­der­stand­ing “so­ci­ety’s struc­ture, its stan­dard of liv­ing and its po­lit­i­cal pri­or­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>Aids found a fer­tile en­vi­ron­ment to spread thanks to the ho­mo­pho­bia and pu­ri­tanism of 1980s Amer­ica, and in med­i­cal con­spir­acy the­o­ries that later swept parts of Africa. Cholera in the 19th cen­tury seized on cities whose pop­u­la­tions had boomed with­out build­ing the ba­sic san­i­ta­tion needed to pro­vide safe drink­ing wa­ter. Small­pox from the 16th to the 19th cen­turies laid waste to indige­nous pop­u­la­tions in the New World, giv­ing colo­nial pow­ers the chance to take con­trol of vast tracts of land with only lim­ited war­fare.</p>
    <p>What does the dev­as­ta­tion wrought by Covid-19 tell us about the un­der­ly­ing patholo­gies of our own cul­ture and time? It’s hard to es­cape one com­mon fac­tor in mul­ti­ple out­breaks. Again and again, clus­ters of in­fec­tion have been as­so­ci­ated with those whose work is low-paid, in­se­cure and con­tin­gent. In a data­base of ma­jor spread­ing events com­piled by re­searchers at the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine, nearly 80 per cent of in­fec­tions can be traced to food pro­cess­ing plants, ships, aged care homes, bars, restau­rants, shops and worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>All of those are places no­to­ri­ously as­so­ci­ated with low pay and poor job se­cu­rity. Of­fice work­ers are al­most ab­sent from the records, ex­cept for 148 cases as­so­ci­ated with a busi­ness con­fer­ence. The same pat­tern has shown up in coun­try af­ter coun­try.</p>
    <p>In the United States, many of the largest out­breaks were as­so­ci­ated with meat­pack­ing plants, which gained in­famy for poor work­ing con­di­tions more than a cen­tury ago. Sin­ga­pore’s early suc­cess in sup­press­ing the virus was un­der­mined by huge out­breaks in the dor­mi­to­ries where for­eign work­ers are housed out of sight.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, the mul­ti­ply­ing out­breaks in care homes have been linked to tem­po­rary staff on zero-hour con­tracts be­ing trans­ferred be­tween fa­cil­i­ties. In</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, a fail­ure of ini­tial sup­pres­sion ef­forts was sim­i­larly linked to pri­vate se­cu­rity guards at quar­an­tine ho­tels. Some told ABC TV last week they were re­cruited via What­sApp, given no train­ing, and told to bring their own face masks.</p>
    <p>The ef­fects of that show up in the dif­fer­en­tial risk from the coronaviru­s. In the US, black peo­ple are more than twice as likely to die from the coronaviru­s rel­a­tive to whites and Asians. They’re also sig­nif­i­cantly over-rep­re­sented in the sorts of work­ing-class ser­vice-sec­tor jobs as­so­ci­ated with in­fec­tion clus­ters.</p>
    <p>In Eng­land, res­i­dents of Ne­wham – a low-in­come area in east Lon­don – died at rates seven times higher than those in Guild­ford, an af­flu­ent part of the semi-ru­ral com­muter belt on the other side of the city, ac­cord­ing to a govern­ment study in May.</p>
    <p>Re­mark­ably, con­sid­er­ing what a large share of pre­vi­ous coronaviru­s in­fec­tions from Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) and Mers (Mid­dle East res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) hap­pened in health­care set­tings, hospi­tal work­ers have been rel­a­tively spared in the Covid-19 pan­demic, with ev­i­dence sug­gest­ing that front-line work­ers are be­ing in­fected at even lower rates than medics less di­rectly ex­posed. That shows that te­dious but straight­for­ward pre­cau­tions are enough to sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce the risk of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is whether, as a so­ci­ety, we think it worth­while to take such steps when those at risk are not med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als, but low-paid gig econ­omy work­ers.</p>
    <p>In the US, em­ploy­ees who have asked to stay home rather than re­turn to face in­fec­tion have been fired, and in some states kicked off un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits. De­press­ingly, it seems too many would rather risk hun­dreds of thou­sands of deaths by re­open­ing busi­nesses and forc­ing staff back into work, in­stead of bor­row­ing the funds needed to keep them at home, even tem­po­rar­ily, on a live­able in­come.</p>
    <p>With nearly US$15 tril­lion (S$20.7 tril­lion) of debt now trad­ing at neg­a­tive yields, gov­ern­ments in wealthy coun­tries can bor­row for next to noth­ing. Rather than look­ing for ways to push work­ers back into harm’s way and turn them into fresh sources of in­fec­tion, we should be do­ing all we can to give them the same pro­tec­tion that we grant the le­gions of white-col­lar em­ploy­ees who have been work­ing from home for months.</p>
    <p>Looked at from the per­spec­tive of more than 600,000 dead and 15 mil­lion in­fected, our re­luc­tance to coun­te­nance such steps looks like a form of mad­ness.</p>
    <p>Dis­eases are of­ten most deadly when they can seize on a pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tion to over­whelm the body’s nat­u­ral de­fences. The sit­u­a­tion is lit­tle dif­fer­ent when it comes to the body politic. So­ci­ety’s re­fusal to grant the un­der­paid and under-em­ployed the same pro­tec­tions it af­fords the bet­ter off is the co-mor­bid­ity that’s killing us.</p>
