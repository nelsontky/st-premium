    <p>Auc­tion house Phillips (in as­so­ci­a­tion with Bacs & Russo) has nabbed two big ones for its an­nual flag­ship New York watch auc­tion, Rac­ing Pulse, which takes place on Dec 12.</p>
    <p>Both time­pieces graced the wrists of two late Hol­ly­wood leg­ends: one is Paul New­man’s Rolex Day­tona Ref. 6263 and, the other, a Heuer Monaco worn by Steve Mc­Queen in the clas­sic 1971 rac­ing film Le Mans.</p>
    <p>Con­signed by his daugh­ter Clea New­man Soderlund, the Day­tona Ref. 6263 was given to New­man in 1983 by his wife Joanne Woodward to cel­e­brate their 25th wed­ding an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>Fea­tur­ing a bold black dial with white sub di­als, as well as a Big Red Day­tona logo at six o’clock, the watch is in­scribed with the words, “Drive slowly Joanne”, on the case­back.</p>
    <p>The star of movies like The Sting (1973) and The Tow­er­ing In­ferno (1974), New­man was a big rac­ing fan and his pas­sion for the sport of­ten got his wife wor­ried, hence the in­scrip­tion. He died in 2008.</p>
    <p>In a signed let­ter ac­com­pa­ny­ing the watch, Ms Soderlund, who was given the time­piece by her fa­ther, wrote: “He wore the watch nearly ev­ery day un­til he gave it to me. He was pho­tographed wear­ing it on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions as was I.</p>
    <p>“It has been a trea­sure of mine for al­most 13 years. To me, this watch shows my mother’s tol­er­ance of his con­tin­ued pas­sion for rac­ing and re­flects the en­dur­ing love be­tween them which re­mained for an­other 25 years un­til his pass­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Boutros, Phillips’ Head of Watches, Amer­i­cas, said: “While many know Joanne Woodward and Paul New­man as ac­tors and phi­lan­thropists, their names sig­nal some­thing more to watch col­lec­tors – an ex­tra­or­di­nary im­pact on the field of watch col­lect­ing.</p>
    <p>“Through­out his life­time, Paul New­man was pho­tographed wear­ing a hand­ful of Rolex Cos­mo­graph Day­tona watches. With­out any doubt, it is this as­so­ci­a­tion with Paul New­man that has led to the Rolex Day­tona be­ing uni­ver­sally re­garded as pos­si­bly the world’s most sought af­ter wrist­watch.</p>
    <p>“Of these, the watch he owned and wore the long­est is the present Big Red Day­tona Ref. 6263. It is among the most exclusive hand­ful of watches with im­pec­ca­ble New­man-fam­ily prove­nance.”</p>
    <p>Pun­dits are cu­ri­ous to see how much the watch will fetch, al­though the auc­tion house coyly es­ti­mates it to be worth more than “US$1 mil­lion” (S$1.34 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, an­other Cos­mo­graph Day­tona – also once owned by New­man – sold in 2017 for a stag­ger­ing US$17.8 mil­lion, set­ting the record for the most ex­pen­sive watch ever sold at an auc­tion.</p>
    <p>To this day, it re­mains the prici­est Rolex ever auc­tioned.</p>
    <p>A por­tion of the pro­ceeds from the sale of the Ref. 6263 will go to char­i­ta­ble out­fits, in­clud­ing Se­ri­ousFun Chil­dren’s Net­work and Safe Wa­ter Net­work, which were founded by New­man him­self.</p>
    <p>The Heuer Monaco, mean­while, also has a fas­ci­nat­ing his­tory. It is one of six Monaco time­pieces worn by Mc­Queen – who, like New­man, was also a rac­ing enthusiast – in the film Le Mans.</p>
    <p>Four of the watches were kept by the prop mas­ter and the re­main­ing two by the ac­tor.</p>
    <p>The watch of­fered next month is one of them, and given by Mc­Queen – who died in 1980 – to Mr Haig All­tou­nian, chief me­chanic on the film. Like New­man’s Day­tona, it also has an in­scrip­tion at the back: “To Haig/Le Mans 1970.”</p>
    <p>Mr Boutros con­sid­ers the time­piece “one of the most im­por­tant Heuer wrist­watches of all time”.</p>
    <p>“Worn on Mc­Queen’s wrist while driv­ing the film’s Porsche 917 at speeds above 320kmh, its in­cred­i­ble prove­nance, won­der­ful state of preser­va­tion and adrenaline­fu­elled his­tory make it an ul­ti­mate tro­phy watch for the con­nois­seur.”</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced in 1969, the Monaco is one of the world’s first self-wind­ing chrono­graph wrist­watches.</p>
    <p>Mc­Queen gave Mr All­tou­nian the watch to show his ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the me­chanic’s role in keep­ing him and oth­ers on the set of Le Mans safe.</p>
    <p>Di­rected by Lee H. Katzin, the cult clas­sic is based on and fea­tured ac­tual footage from the 24 Hours Of Le Mans, an auto en­durance race held an­nu­ally since 1923.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the Day­tona and the Monaco (“es­ti­mate upon re­quest”), the Rac­ing Pulse auc­tion will also of­fer five watches from the per­sonal col­lec­tion of ac­tion star Sylvester Stal­lone.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the Pan­erai Lu­mi­nor he wore in the 1996 thriller Day­light as well as four Richard Mille time­pieces, in­clud­ing one he sported in the 2014 ac­tion flick The Ex­pend­ables 3.</p>
    <p>He wore the watch nearly ev­ery day un­til he gave it to me... This watch shows my mother’s tol­er­ance of his con­tin­ued pas­sion for rac­ing and re­flects the en­dur­ing love be­tween them. ’’</p>
