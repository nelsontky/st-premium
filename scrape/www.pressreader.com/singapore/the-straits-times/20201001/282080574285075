    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should not think that cur­rently val­ued skill sets will be enough to see them through the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>This and two other cher­ished be­liefs were myths that Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) man­ag­ing direc­tor Chng Kai Fong sought to de­bunk when ad­dress­ing ed­u­ca­tors yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The first myth is that dig­i­tal and tech­ni­cal skills will be enough. The sec­ond is that Sin­ga­pore­ans need to fo­cus on op­por­tu­ni­ties only within the coun­try, and the third is pri­ori­tis­ing long-term ca­reer plans, he said in his key­note ad­dress at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) Teach­ers’ Con­fer­ence, which was held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>He said many peo­ple think learn­ing to use data and to code will be suf­fi­cient. “I’m not say­ing that’s not im­por­tant, but I’m say­ing that’s not enough... be­cause many of (th­ese pro­cesses) will even­tu­ally be au­to­mated if they can be.”</p>
    <p>Soft skills – em­pa­thy, the abil­ity to tell a story and cre­ate con­nec­tions with oth­ers – will help peo­ple dif­fer­en­ti­ate them­selves.</p>
    <p>Mr Chng also said it will be im­por­tant to dis­abuse peo­ple of the no­tion that “Sin­ga­pore is enough”.</p>
    <p>“What wor­ries me is we are so focused on what’s hap­pen­ing here... ‘I just want to get a sim­ple job’, ‘I want to just cre­ate stuff for Sin­ga­pore’. In­creas­ingly, if you think that way, you’ll start get­ting pres­sures from else­where be­cause there’s global com­pe­ti­tion. There’s com­pe­ti­tion with ro­bots and tech­nol­ogy.” There are op­por­tu­ni­ties glob­ally and in Asia, he added, and Sin­ga­pore­ans must en­sure they stay rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that many pride them­selves on long-term plan­ning, he said: “Grow­ing up as a Sin­ga­porean, we all think there’s a di­vine plan for us and our chil­dren... You clear sec­ondary school, go on, get a job and that’s your plan for life.”</p>
    <p>But life is not that straight­for­ward. The abil­ity to re­act and plan in the short term will be im­por­tant, he stressed. Stu­dents should pur­sue their “ob­ses­sions and side hus­tles”, which will help them build con­fi­dence and find mean­ing.</p>
    <p>ITE chief ex­ec­u­tive Low Khah Gek also spoke at the con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, touch­ing on dis­rup­tions in the econ­omy due to Covid-19. “We need to un­der­stand the new re­al­ity of where the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy is head­ing, fur­ther shifts in in­dus­tries and busi­nesses and, more im­por­tantly, the changes to jobs and work­place skills.”</p>
    <p>Dr Gog Soon Joo, chief skills and re­search of­fi­cer as well as chief fu­tur­ist at Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore, said there will be fewer “sin­gle skill” jobs. A data sci­en­tist, for in­stance, will be ex­pected to do sto­ry­telling and con­vey a message with anal­y­sis. “We ex­pect more and more job con­tent to change.”</p>
