    <p>SILVERSTON­E • Lewis Hamil­ton heard the warn­ing loud and clear on Sun­day af­ter he and Mercedes were soundly beaten by a resur­gent Red Bull and Max Ver­stap­pen at the 70th An­niver­sary Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton, chas­ing his sev­enth world ti­tle, still leads the driv­ers’ stand­ings on 107 points but Ver­stap­pen, cour­tesy of his win at Silverston­e, has moved into sec­ond spot on 77 points.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas is third, a fur­ther four points adrift.</p>
    <p>In the con­struc­tors’ ta­ble, the Sil­ver Ar­rows are top on 180 points, with Red Bull sec­ond on 113. Fer­rari are a dis­tant third on 55.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, 35, ac­knowl­edged the threat posed by Ver­stap­pen and his team and said: “It’s great, I want to have races where they are chal­leng­ing. I am ex­cited to watch this race.</p>
    <p>“The Red Bull seems to be quite close in race con­di­tions to us and to­day it was stronger. It shows they don’t have as bad a pack­age as per­haps peo­ple had thought.”</p>
    <p>His three wins this sea­son put him on a ca­reer to­tal of 87, just four shy of Michael Schu­macher’s For­mula One record. The Ger­man’s seven world ti­tles is an­other of Hamil­ton’s tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Red Bull’s per­for­mance over the week­end – aided by a clever choice by the team’s se­nior strat­egy en­gi­neer Hannah Schmitz to start the race on hard com­pound tyres while most of their ri­vals opted for medi­ums – Hamil­ton was tak­ing noth­ing for granted.</p>
    <p>“It will be in­ter­est­ing to see their progressio­n through the rest of the year,” he said. “I don’t think it will be easy (for us) by any means.”</p>
    <p>Tac­tics cer­tainly played their part but equally piv­otal was Ver­stap­pen’s courage and speed be­hind the wheel.</p>
    <p>“Max was just chill­ing out at the be­gin­ning of the race, we had them cov­ered to­day,” said team boss Chris­tian Horner. “What­ever they did, when they pit­ted, they could not pull away – Max was able to cover them.”</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen had been sec­ond in the pre­vi­ous two races and third in the one be­fore that, the Steier­mark Grand Prix in Aus­tria.</p>
    <p>If the Dutch­man had not re­tired in the Aus­trian opener with a tech­ni­cal prob­lem while in sec­ond place, the gap to Hamil­ton would be a lot nar­rower but he was un­der no il­lu­sions about the task ahead.</p>
    <p>“That was very sat­is­fy­ing for us,” said the 22-year-old. “We could have won last week when they had tyre blowouts, but that would not have been the same, but to­day was very good be­cause we beat them on pure pace.”</p>
    <p>He said he be­lieved Red Bull can move closer to the speed of the Mercedes and some­times put pres­sure on them, no­tably in hot con­di­tions like those at Silverston­e last Sun­day and fore­cast for this week’s Span­ish Grand Prix in Cat­alo­nia.</p>
    <p>He showed, also, that he has plenty in re­serve when he is rac­ing by pro­duc­ing a se­ries of quips dur­ing the race as he headed to victory.</p>
    <p>When he was asked to ease off in the early stages, to save his tyres, he re­jected the idea say­ing “this is our chance to close up to the Mercedes – so I’m not going to drive like a grandma and fol­low them.”</p>
