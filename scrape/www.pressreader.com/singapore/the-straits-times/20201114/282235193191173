    <p>Sev­eral pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment spots were raided this week as the po­lice stepped up en­force­ment against Covid-19 breaches, ahead of a pi­lot pro­gramme to al­low up to 25 nightspots to re­open from next month.</p>
    <p>At least one of the out­lets ap­peared to be op­er­at­ing il­le­gally.</p>
    <p>Three out­lets were found to have bro­ken rules un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, while eight peo­ple were in­ves­ti­gated for breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The raids on Wed­nes­day were part of a joint en­force­ment op­er­a­tion led by the Cen­tral Po­lice Divi­sion. The Straits Times ac­com­pa­nied the po­lice team on its op­er­a­tion, which cov­ered pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment out­lets in Ali­wal Street, Tem­ple Street, Beach Road, Syed Alwi Road and South Bridge Road.</p>
    <p>At a night­club in Ali­wal Street, po­lice of­fi­cers had to force their way through the en­trance, which was locked by the oc­cu­pants.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the po­lice said that dur­ing the raid, eight peo­ple were in­ves­ti­gated for al­legedly gath­er­ing in a group of more than five in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 30 women, aged be­tween 22 and 53, were also ar­rested for employment-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>One of t he out­lets which breached Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions was found to have also vi­o­lated liquor li­cence con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are con­tin­u­ing with their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice Gre­gory Tan said the op­er­a­tion is part of the po­lice’s ef­forts to stamp out il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties and take strong en­force­ment ac­tion against “egre­gious breaches” of Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“As we go fur­ther into phase two, we have seen more out­lets op­er­at­ing il­le­gally, as well as more il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties hap­pen­ing un­der the guise of le­git­i­mate eater­ies that have been al­lowed to op­er­ate,” he said.</p>
    <p>As part of mea­sures to com­bat the pan­demic, en­ter­tain­ment out­lets have been closed since March 27.</p>
    <p>Those with li­cences that al­low them to op­er­ate as food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments have since re­opened, al­beit with re­stric­tions on group sizes and a 10.30pm curb on al­co­hol sales.</p>
    <p>Up to 25 nightspots will be able to re­open from next month with strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place, as part of a pi­lot pro­gramme an­nounced by the Gov­ern­ment on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot for pubs and bars is ex­pected to kick off next month, with se­lected es­tab­lish­ments sub­ject to the same rules as restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Karaoke joints and night­clubs that are cho­sen for the pro­gramme are ex­pected to re­open next Jan­uary. They will be re­quired to have in place mea­sures such as hav­ing pa­trons wear masks on the dance floor and show proof of neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests be­fore en­ter­ing.</p>
