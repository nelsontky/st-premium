    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS The United States, Ja­pan and many Euro­pean Union na­tions joined a call urg­ing China to re­spect the hu­man rights of mi­nor­ity Uighurs, and also ex­press­ing con­cern about the sit­u­a­tion in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“We call on China to re­spect hu­man rights, par­tic­u­larly the rights of per­sons be­long­ing to re­li­gious and eth­nic mi­nori­ties, es­pe­cially in Xin­jiang and Ti­bet,” said Ger­many’s UN am­bas­sador Christoph Heusgen, who led the ini­tia­tive dur­ing a meet­ing on hu­man rights. Among the 39 sig­na­tory coun­tries were the US, most of the EU states, as well as Canada, Haiti, Hon­duras, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>“We are gravely con­cerned about the hu­man rights sit­u­a­tion in Xin­jiang and the re­cent de­vel­op­ments in Hong Kong,” said the dec­la­ra­tion on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“We call on China to al­low im­me­di­ate, mean­ing­ful and un­fet­tered ac­cess to Xin­jiang for in­de­pen­dent ob­servers in­clud­ing the UN High Com­mis­sioner for Hu­man Rights.”</p>
    <p>Im­me­di­ately af­ter­wards, the en­voy for Pak­istan read out a state­ment signed by 55 coun­tries, in­clud­ing China, de­nounc­ing any use of the sit­u­a­tion in Hong Kong as an ex­cuse for in­ter­fer­ence in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing Ger­many, the US and Bri­tain, Chi­nese Am­bas­sador Zhang Jun crit­i­cised what he called their “hyp­o­crit­i­cal” at­ti­tude and de­manded that they “put away your ar­ro­gance and prej­u­dice, and pull back from the brink, now”.</p>
    <p>Hu­man Rights Watch praised the fact that so many coun­tries had signed the dec­la­ra­tion “de­spite China’s per­sis­tent threats and in­tim­i­da­tion tac­tics against those who speak out”.</p>
    <p>Last year, a sim­i­lar text drafted by Bri­tain had only 23 sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>Western diplo­mats have said China is pil­ing on more pres­sure each year to dis­suade United Na­tions mem­ber states from sign­ing such state­ments, threat­en­ing to block the re­newal of peace­keep­ing mis­sions or pre­vent­ing the build­ing of new em­bassy fa­cil­i­ties in China.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, China led a group of 26 coun­tries in a joint dec­la­ra­tion call­ing for an end to US sanc­tions, which they said vi­o­late hu­man rights dur­ing the strug­gle to com­bat the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute said it had iden­ti­fied more than 380 “sus­pected de­ten­tion fa­cil­i­ties” in the Xin­jiang re­gion, where China is said to have held more than one mil­lion Uighurs and other mostly Mus­lim Tur­kic-speak­ing res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>In the US, the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives passed a Bill last month that aims to ban im­ports from Xin­jiang, con­tend­ing that abuses of the Uighur peo­ple are so wide­spread that all goods from the re­gion should be con­sid­ered made with slave labour.</p>
