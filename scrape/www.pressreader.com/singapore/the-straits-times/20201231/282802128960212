    <p>If you were look­ing for a sin­gle week that cap­tured the story of pop mu­sic this year – or maybe hit­mak­ing in the stream­ing era writ large – zoom in on the week of April 26.</p>
    <p>On April 29, Bey­once and Me­gan Thee Stal­lion re­leased a remixed, col­lab­o­ra­tive ver­sion of Sav­age, the swag­ger­ing Me­gan solo track that had al­ready taken TikTok by storm. Two days later came an­other: Doja Cat’s sum­mery Say So, now with verses from her stylis­tic fore­bear Nicki Mi­naj.</p>
    <p>Bill­board watch­ers set­tled in for an epic chart bat­tle, if only be­cause every­thing else hap­pen­ing in the world was unimag­in­ably de­press­ing. Once the num­bers had been tal­lied for the May 16 Hot 100 chart, Say So came out on top, with Sav­age (Remix) ar­riv­ing at No. 2.</p>
    <p>In a larger sense, though, it was a win for all four of them. This was the first time four black women had oc­cu­pied the top two spots on Bill­board’s Hot 100 chart. And, two weeks later, when Sav­age (Remix) surged to No. 1, this sense of a shared coronation was even more pal­pa­ble.</p>
    <p>Widen­ing the lens a bit though, these high-pro­file, fan army-unit­ing duets were the lat­est it­er­a­tion of one of the year’s defin­ing pop</p>
    <p>Say So by (from left) Doja Cat and Nicki Mi­naj topped Bill­board’s Hot 100 chart on May 16, while Sav­age by Me­gan Thee Stal­lion and Bey­once was No. 2 – the first time four black women had oc­cu­pied the top two spots.</p>
    <p>trends. From May 16 un­til Aug 8, each song that topped the Bill­board Hot 100 was a paired col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mu­si­cal col­lab­o­ra­tions are com­mon in any era, and it is no co­in­ci­dence that all three of the longestrei­gn­ing Hot 100 No. 1s are the prod­uct of mul­ti­ple artists: the coun­try-rap hand­shake that was Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus’ 2019 Old Town Road remix; the 2017 global jug­ger­naut Des­pac­ito, orig­i­nally re­leased by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yan­kee, then given an English-lan­guage boost with a Justin Bieber remix; and Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s 1995 al­ls­tar tear-jerker One Sweet Day.</p>
    <p>When a sin­gle can ap­peal to mul­ti­ple genre for­mats, cul­tural back­grounds and fan­doms, it has the po­ten­tial to move more units. But in a pop mu­si­cal mo­ment ruled by stream­ing num­bers and al­go­rith</p>
    <p>mic savvy, it has be­come even more clear why A-list col­lab­o­ra­tions have proved to be the safest chart bets.</p>
    <p>Call it the Avengers era of pop mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Take, for ex­am­ple, Rain On Me, Lady Gaga and Ari­ana Grande’s house-pop team-up that hit No. 1 on June 6, the week after Sav­age (Remix). This was the sec­ond sin­gle from Gaga’s al­bum Chro­mat­ica, fol­low­ing Stupid Love, a dance floor thumper that did re­spectably if not spec­tac­u­larly on the Hot 100, peak­ing at No. 5.</p>
    <p>What is bet­ter than Lady Gaga’s Lit­tle Mon­sters ral­ly­ing be­hind a sin­gle? Lit­tle Mon­sters and Grande’s Ari­ana­tors ral­ly­ing be­hind a sin­gle.</p>
    <p>Solo or in a pair, Grande has been an ex­cep­tion­ally suc­cess­ful artist in the stream­ing econ­omy, which also means she is a de­sir­able power-duet part­ner. Bieber found this out when Stuck With U, their quar­an­tine-themed char­ity sin­gle, went to the top of the chart on May 23.</p>
    <p>“Em­pow­er­ment” is one of mod­ern pop mu­sic’s most vir­tu­ous buzz­words, and it is easy for la­bels to spin these col­lab­o­ra­tions into in­her­ently pos­i­tive, feel-good nar­ra­tives of mu­tual sup­port. And given how white and male the Hot 100 has skewed in re­cent years, it is cer­tainly re­fresh­ing to see so many black and fe­male artists tri­umph­ing while os­ten­si­bly re­ject­ing the idea that they are one an­other’s com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>But, es­pe­cially in a year when tour­ing was not a vi­able in­come stream, col­lab­o­ra­tive hits also seemed like savvier busi­ness strate­gies in the stream­ing era of di­min­ish­ing re­turns. The ul­ti­mate proof of the power col­lab­o­ra­tion’s ubiq­uity is in the way cer­tain fan com­mu­ni­ties have started to boast about its op­po­site.</p>
    <p>When BTS’ first English-lan­guage sin­gle Dy­na­mite hit No. 1 later in the year, for ex­am­ple, a fre­quent re­frain was to mar­vel that they had done it with “no fea­tures”.</p>
    <p>Most pop ac­tions have equal and op­po­site re­ac­tions, so per­haps the next trend, or next year’s most cov­eted hit-mak­ing flex, will be the solo No. 1.</p>
