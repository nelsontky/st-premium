    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s up­com­ing move to raise the salary thresh­old for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als in or­der for them to qual­ify to work here is a timely one that will en­cour­age firms to source more lo­cals, said ob­servers and busi­ness groups.</p>
    <p>But it looks set to push up busi­ness costs in the long run, some of them added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo an­nounced there will be fur­ther ad­just­ments to Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign work­force poli­cies, in­clud­ing rais­ing the salary cri­te­ria for Em­ploy­ment Passes (EPs) and S Passes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit told The Straits Times that with the change in the salary cri­te­ria, more em­ploy­ers will prob­a­bly look for lo­cal hires as it will be harder to ab­sorb the ex­tra costs or pass on the costs to con­sumers amid the eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Sim Gim Guan noted, how­ever, that as the labour mar­ket con­di­tion is gen­er­ally weak, the change would not af­fect em­ploy­ers im­me­di­ately if they are not hir­ing any EP and S Pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>He added that am­ple time should be given to com­pa­nies to ad­just as ex­ist­ing work pass hold­ers may have taken a wage cut due to Covid-19 and fall short of the cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Man­u­fac­tur­ing Fed­er­a­tion sees the move as part of a holis­tic strat­egy to en­sure Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to have an ef­fi­cient and pro­duc­tive work­force, with a bal­ance of lo­cal and for­eign man­power.</p>
    <p>But its pres­i­dent Dou­glas Foo said some mem­bers had given feed­back that even if they wanted to hire more lo­cals be­cause of the hike in salary cri­te­ria, they are not sure that lo­cal work­ers will take the jobs done by the for­eign work­force.</p>
    <p>“Our lo­cal man­power must con­tin­u­ally ac­cept the chal­lenge to re­train and up­skill so as to be ready for a new nor­mal in these times,” he added.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior economist Chua Hak Bin said that in the longer term, the move may raise busi­ness costs and re­duce po­ten­tial growth, which could im­pede re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua’s con­cerns were shared by the pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises, Mr Kurt Wee, who said that since eight to nine years ago, busi­nesses have been fac­ing a “very tight­ened” for­eign work­force land­scape.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing risks of pol­icy be­ing overly pro­tec­tive to­wards the lo­cal work­force and this may have a neg­a­tive im­pact on the longer term re­silience and com­pet­i­tive­ness of our lo­cal work­force,” said Mr Wee.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the fixed monthly salary thresh­old for EP hold­ers is at least $3,900, and for S Pass hold­ers, at l east $2,400. The qual­i­fy­ing salaries are higher for older and more ex­pe­ri­enced work­ers.</p>
    <p>The im­pend­ing in­crease would be the sec­ond an­nounced this year and comes amid ris­ing re­trench­ments and con­cerns about com­pe­ti­tion be­tween Sin­ga­pore­ans and foreigners in the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>While she did not give fur­ther de­tails, Mrs Teo ex­plained that the change is a con­se­quence of the eco­nomic dis­rup­tion caused by Covid-19 and the re­sult­ing “slack” in the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In March dur­ing the de­bate on her min­istry’s bud­get, she had said that rais­ing the salary thresh­old helps to en­sure a level play­ing field for ex­pe­ri­enced lo­cal mid-ca­reer</p>
    <p>PMETs (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians).</p>
    <p>It is also in line with the ris­ing pay of fresh grad­u­ates from lo­cal au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties, she had added.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said yes­ter­day that the move, to­gether with other frame­works and quo­tas, are pos­i­tive steps that will help weed out un­fair prac­tices and en­sure fair­ness in work­places.</p>
    <p>He said in a Face­book post: “(I) am glad that the Pres­i­dent in her open­ing ad­dress as well as the Ad­den­dum by the Min­istry of Man­power... re­flect the need for us to up the ante on fair hir­ing and fair re­trench­ments in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant with the on­slaught of dis­rup­tion and trans­for­ma­tion which started sev­eral years ago and ex­ac­er­bated by the ram­i­fi­ca­tions of Covid-19.”</p>
