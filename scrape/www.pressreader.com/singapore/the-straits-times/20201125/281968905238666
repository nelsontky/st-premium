    <p>PARIS • Po­lice used tear gas as they dis­man­tled a new mi­grant camp in the cen­tre of Paris set up to house hun­dreds of refugees evac­u­ated from makeshift sub­ur­ban shel­ters with­out be­ing re­lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers had helped set up around 500 blue tents at the Place de la Republique in the heart of the French cap­i­tal late on Mon­day, which were quickly filled by mi­grants, mostly from Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>Around an hour later, the po­lice ar­rived to dis­man­tle the camp, pick­ing up tents, some­times with peo­ple still in­side, to the protests of mi­grants and jeers from vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>“They are too vi­o­lent,” said a sob­bing 34-year-old Afghan, Mr Shah­bud­din, as he put a grey beanie back on his head af­ter be­ing forced out of his tent. “We just want a roof.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice later used tear gas to dis­perse the rest of the camp, driv­ing the mi­grants out onto the streets of cen­tral Paris.</p>
    <p>The dis­man­tling of the camp comes a week af­ter mi­grants were evac­u­ated from makeshift shel­ters in the north­ern sub­urb of Saint-De­nis with­out be­ing re­lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Mr Ian Brossart, a deputy of the city’s mayor in charge of hous­ing, emer­gency ac­com­mo­da­tion and refugee pro­tec­tion, slammed the “law-and-or­der re­sponse to a so­cial sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>French In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin later said images of the dis­man­tling were “shock­ing” and added that he had or­dered the city’s po­lice to present a re­port on the clear­ance.</p>
    <p>Paris is a key stop-off point on the Euro­pean mi­grant route, with tented camps re­peat­edly sprout­ing up around the city, only to be torn down by the po­lice months later.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of mi­grants have trav­elled from Paris to the port of Calais and at­tempted to stow away on trucks head­ing across the Chan­nel to Eng­land. A small num­ber at­tempt the cross­ing by boat.</p>
    <p>The clear­ance comes af­ter the French gov­ern­ment ap­proved an amended se­cu­rity law that would re­strict the pub­li­ca­tion of pho­tos or videos taken of po­lice of­fi­cers’ faces while they carry out their du­ties in pub­lic spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Me­dia unions say this could give the po­lice a green light to pre­vent jour­nal­ists from do­ing their work and po­ten­tially doc­u­ment­ing abuses by se­cu­rity forces.</p>
    <p>“We’re here to show that we have nowhere else to go,” said Mr Mur­taza, 20, from Afghanista­n be­fore the camp was dis­persed. “We can’t live like an­i­mals, we just want to claim asy­lum.”</p>
