    <p>WASHINGTON • Pan­demic hair get­ting out of con­trol?</p>
    <p>Take a tip from Ge­orge Clooney: The Hol­ly­wood style i con has re­vealed he trims his sig­na­ture sil­ver locks with a Flow­bee – a quirky home-styling de­vice that at­taches to a vac­uum cleaner.</p>
    <p>The Flow­bee has long been the butt of jokes since it ap­peared on late-night tele­vi­sion in­fomer­cials in the late 1980s.</p>
    <p>But in pro­mot­ing his new movie The Mid­night Sky, Clooney, 59, dis­closed he was a long-time fan of the much-mocked gad­get, when asked dur­ing a CBS in­ter­view if he had been cut­ting his own hair dur­ing the coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been cut­ting my own hair for 25 years,” said the Os­car-win­ner, whose name is syn­ony­mous with red­car­pet glam­our. “My hair’s really like straw and so it’s easy to cut. You can’t really make too many mis­takes.</p>
    <p>“So, years ago, I bought a thing called a Flow­bee, which when we were...”, he added, at which point his stunned in­ter­viewer broke in with: “You did not.”</p>
    <p>The Flow­bee cuts hair and sucks up the clip­pings at the same time, which has led to its use by as­tro­nauts on long-haul space mis­sions in the past.</p>
    <p>It re­tails for around US$50 (S$67) and the com­pany that makes it saw sales spike at the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic ear­lier this year, as hair­dress­ing sa­lons were forced to shut their doors and mil­lions of peo­ple stayed home.</p>
    <p>And sales look set to go up again af­ter Clooney en­thused in the in­ter­view: “Lis­ten, man, it works.”</p>
