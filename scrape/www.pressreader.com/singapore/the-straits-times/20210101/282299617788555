    <p>BEI­JING • China’s fac­tory ac­tiv­ity ex­panded last month but at a slower pace, as the coun­try leads a pack of ma­jor economies emerg­ing from the coro­n­avirus slump.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial man­u­fac­tur­ing Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) fell to 51.9 last month from 52.1 in Novem­ber, data from the Na­tional Bureau of Sta­tis­tics (NBS) showed yes­ter­day, re­main­ing above the 50-point mark that sep­a­rates growth from con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts had ex­pected it to fall slightly to 52. China’s vast in­dus­trial sec­tor has staged an im­pres­sive re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus shock, thanks to sur­pris­ingly strong ex­ports.</p>
    <p>But tougher coro­n­avirus con­trol mea­sures in many of its key trad­ing part­ners in the West and re­cent do­mes­tic in­fec­tions could dent in­dus­trial de­mand, weigh­ing on the re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial PMI, which largely fo­cuses on big and state-owned firms, showed that the sub-in­dex for new ex­port or­ders stood at 51.3 last month, eas­ing from 51.5 a month ear­lier.</p>
    <p>But an in­dex for fac­tory prices rose strongly, re­flect­ing solid over­seas de­mand as well as in­creased ship­ping costs, even though some ex­port mar­kets are un­der lock­down, said Dr Iris Pang, chief econ­o­mist for Greater China at ING.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic in­di­ca­tors rang­ing from trade to pro­ducer prices all sug­gest a fur­ther pickup in the in­dus­trial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>A sub-in­dex for small busi­ness ac­tiv­ity stood at 48.8 last month, sharply down from Novem­ber’s 50.1 and re­turn­ing to con­trac­tionary ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>A sub-in­dex for em­ploy­ment in the of­fi­cial PMI stood at 49.6 last month, slightly up from Novem­ber’s 49.5.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese econ­omy is ex­pected to ex­pand around 2 per cent for the full year – the weak­est in more than three decades but still much stronger than other ma­jor economies strug­gling to con­tain new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>China has seen a strong im­prove­ment in re­tail sales driven by firm de­mand for au­tos and com­mu­ni­ca­tion equip­ment.</p>
    <p>In the ser­vice sec­tor, ac­tiv­ity ex­panded for the 10th straight month, al­beit at a some­what slower clip.</p>
    <p>Ahead of China’s peak travel sea­son, the cap­i­tal Bei­jing im­posed lock­downs on some Covid-19-in­fected ar­eas, the first since the last coro­n­avirus out­break in the months of June and July.</p>
