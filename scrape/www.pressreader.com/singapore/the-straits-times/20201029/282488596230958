    <p>What would hap­pen if su­per­heroes were real but abused their pow­ers and sta­tus?</p>
    <p>The tele­vi­sion show The Boys – based on the cult comics of the same name by Garth En­nis, and now stream­ing on Ama­zon Prime Video in Sin­ga­pore – imag­ines a world where “su­pes”, as they are called, are in­flu­en­tial celebri­ties adored by the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>But be­hind closed doors, most are ar­ro­gant, cor­rupt and reck­less, which is why a vig­i­lante group known as The Boys tries to ex­pose the truth about them – in par­tic­u­lar, a team of high-pro­file su­pes known as The Seven.</p>
    <p>The show is per­fect for those who love the su­per­hero genre, but en­joy laugh­ing at its ab­sur­di­ties.</p>
    <p>So says showrun­ner Eric Kripke who, along with the cast, spoke to The Straits Times and other me­dia ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Kripke, the writer be­hind the hit fan­tasy se­ries Su­per­nat­u­ral (2005 to 2020), is asked why he thinks the first sea­son of The Boys, which de­buted last year, was so well re­ceived by view­ers and crit­ics.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s a show that works for peo­ple who both love and hate su­per­hero stuff – it de­liv­ers all the plea­sure of that genre, but also is highly crit­i­cal and de­con­struc­tive of it.</p>
    <p>“And I also think this show re­flects the ex­act minute we’re liv­ing in – peo­ple find it sur­pris­ingly cur­rent and prob­a­bly smarter than they thought it was go­ing to be when they tuned in,” says the 46-year-old, also cred­it­ing the gen­er­ous help­ings of com­edy and vi­o­lence and strong per­for­mances by the cast.</p>
    <p>Karl Ur­ban, 48, plays Billy Butcher, who leads The Boys and loathes all Su­pes – es­pe­cially Home­lander (Antony Starr), leader of The Seven.</p>
    <p>But as ir­rev­er­ent and play­ful as the se­ries is, The Star Trek (2009) and The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002) star says the show has turned into more of a char­ac­ter drama in its sec­ond sea­son.</p>
    <p>Kripke had told the cast “we don’t nec­es­sar­ily want to have more spe­cial ef­fects and big­ger ac­tion se­quences” in the new episodes, the ac­tor says.</p>
    <p>“What we re­ally want to do is just dive deeper into the char­ac­ters, into their jour­neys, and re­ally test</p>
    <p>all of them.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause “all the char­ac­ters have some­thing that’s very im­por­tant to them ripped away from them, and we get to see how they all in­di­vid­u­ally deal with it”, Ur­ban says.</p>
    <p>Starr, who plays Billy’s su­per­pow­ered neme­sis Home­lander, did not want to just be a car­toon vil­lain, ei­ther.</p>
    <p>“I just look at it from the per­spec­tive of the char­ac­ter – what choices is he mak­ing and why,” says the Ban­shee (2013 to 2016) ac­tor.</p>
    <p>“And he hap­pens to be a nar­cis­sis­tic psy­chopath, so the choices he makes are gen­er­ally mo­ti­vated by self­ish rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>Yet with the writ­ers, there were “a lot of dis­cus­sions about not mak­ing Home­lander too mous­ta­chetwirly and arch”, says Starr, 45.</p>
    <p>“And giv­ing him some lay­ers that we might not have seen be­fore in that kind of char­ac­ter.”</p>
    <p>As with the long-run­ning Su­per­nat­u­ral, Kripke finds him­self writ­ing a show that cel­e­brates or­di­nary peo­ple with no su­per­pow­ers try­ing to take down be­ings with spe­cial abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“What I like are the odds of it, be­cause I like un­der­dogs. I like char­ac­ters that are fight­ing against char­ac­ters that are way more pow­er­ful than they are, and fig­ur­ing out</p>
    <p>how they pull it to­gether,” he says.</p>
    <p>Kripke sees the same strug­gle play­ing out in real life against “the 1 per cent, author­ity fig­ures and peo­ple who hold all the cards and all the power”.</p>
    <p>And if there is a mes­sage in The Boys and in Su­per­nat­u­ral, “it’s that there are these mas­sive forces try­ing to grind you down, but you sur­vive by show­ing each other love and loy­alty and form­ing a fam­ily – how­ever you de­fine that”.</p>
