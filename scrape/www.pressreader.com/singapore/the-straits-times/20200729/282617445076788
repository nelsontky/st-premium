    <p>LEE TENG’S WIFE SUF­FERS MIS­CAR­RIAGE: Home-grown tele­vi­sion host Lee Teng has dis­closed on so­cial me­dia that his wife Gina Lin has suf­fered a mis­car­riage.</p>
    <p>Lee, who was born in Tai­wan but moved to Sin­ga­pore when he was a child, shared the heart­break­ing news early yes­ter­day, when he posted a black-and-white photo of their hands on Lin’s baby bump (right, above). The cou­ple (right) had nick­named the baby Lit­tle Bean Sprout.</p>
    <p>Lee, 37, wrote in Chi­nese: “I have to apol­o­gise to ev­ery­one. I am sorry that Lit­tle Bean Sprout is un­able to meet ev­ery­one. He came and left qui­etly.</p>
    <p>“Gina and I are in grief. It has es­pe­cially been dif­fi­cult for Gina.”</p>
    <p>He added in English: “My wife and I are deeply sad­dened by the loss. Par­don us if we are not able to re­ply any mes­sages at the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Lee, the first run­ner-up on lo­cal re­al­ity com­pe­ti­tion Su­perHost in 2006, dis­closed in March that Ms Lin, his girl­friend of seven years, had ac­cepted his mar­riage pro­posal. An ad­ver­tis­ing ex­ec­u­tive who is nine years his ju­nior, she is from Tai­wan and is based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He an­nounced in May that she was five months preg­nant and told Lianhe Zaobao ear­lier this month that they had reg­is­tered their mar­riage in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He said in the same in­ter­view that she had re­turned to Tai­wan to await de­liv­ery, and that he would fly there to be with her next month.</p>
