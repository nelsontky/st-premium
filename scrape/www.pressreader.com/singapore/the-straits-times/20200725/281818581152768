    <p>Mil­lions of stu­dents in the Philip­pines are drop­ping out of school this year, as par­ents fret over a still rag­ing coro­n­avirus out­break and har­bour doubts over how ef­fec­tive dis­tance learn­ing will be.</p>
    <p>Some 23 mil­lion stu­dents in pub­lic and pri­vate schools – out of 28 mil­lion stu­dents in the coun­try – have en­rolled for the 2020-2021 school year, ac­cord­ing to the Depart­ment of Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>While 90 per cent of pub­lic school stu­dents have re-en­rolled, pri­vate schools have seen a plunge in the num­ber of re-en­rollees. Last year, they had four mil­lion. Now, they have only 1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Some 300,000 have trans­ferred to pub­lic schools, while the rest will get in­struc­tion from their par­ents or pri­vate tutors, or just while the year away.</p>
    <p>With so few of their stu­dents re­turn­ing, many pri­vate schools have had to shut down.</p>
    <p>“The drop is due to the pan­demic,” said Ed­u­ca­tion Sec­re­tary Leonor Bri­ones at a Cabi­net meet­ing this week. She said par­ents who are fi­nan­cially strapped be­cause they lost their jobs or had to take pay cuts are trans­fer­ring their chil­dren to pub­lic schools to cut ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Some of these par­ents have also been lob­by­ing for pri­vate schools to re­duce their tu­ition fees as they are mov­ing to dis­tance learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“My chil­dren won’t be us­ing class­rooms, or the lab­o­ra­tory and li­brary. Why should I still pay for mis­cel­la­neous fees?” a mum asked on a Face­book group of af­fected par­ents.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Emil­lie Espina combed through the tu­ition and other fees at her son’s engi­neer­ing school, and found over 10,000 pe­sos (S$196) worth of charges she thinks it should waive be­cause these cover things such as den­tal and ath­let­ics that stu­dents will not be us­ing.</p>
    <p>“We value the ed­u­ca­tion of our chil­dren but fees should not be charged with­out ba­sis and with­out com­pas­sion, es­pe­cially in this try­ing pe­riod,” she said.</p>
    <p>An­other mum, who works from home as an out­sourc­ing agent, said she can no longer af­ford the 40,000 pe­sos to keep her son in a pri­vate school. So, she moved him to a pub­lic school, where she only has to get him a lap­top and pay for print­outs of school mod­ules.</p>
    <p>“I will be the one to teach my kids, so why pay so much for dis­tance learn­ing?” she said.</p>
    <p>It is food and safety first for now, and tu­ition later, said Al­liance of Con­cerned Teach­ers sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ray­mond Basilio.</p>
    <p>The learn­ing ar­range­ment is not ideal, he said. With stu­dents still barred from be­ing in­side class­rooms, the gov­ern­ment is rolling out “blended learn­ing” as an al­ter­na­tive: a com­bi­na­tion of on­line classes, printed ma­te­ri­als, and broad­cast­ing classes through TV and ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Most of those in pub­lic schools do not have In­ter­net sub­scrip­tions. They will have to rely on mod­ules their schools will send, and get in­struc­tions via TV or ra­dio.</p>
    <p>With their par­ents with­out a source of liveli­hood or barely hang­ing on to their jobs, these stu­dents will have to learn on their own.</p>
    <p>In farm­ing com­mu­ni­ties, they are un­likely to have any time for school­work if they are at home, as they are ex­pected to help out with house­hold chores and mak­ing ends meet.</p>
    <p>Ms Bri­ones said classes will start on Aug 24, whether schools are ready or not. “The bot­tom line is that the chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion will con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Basilio said car­ry­ing on un­der the less than ideal con­di­tions comes at the chil­dren’s ex­pense.</p>
    <p>“One child left be­hind is one too many,” he said.</p>
