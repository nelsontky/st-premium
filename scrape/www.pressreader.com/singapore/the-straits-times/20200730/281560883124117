    <p>HBO’s Watch­men, a reimag­in­ing of a superhero graphic novel that tack­led racism in the United States, topped the nom­i­na­tions for this year’s Emmy Awards on Tues­day with 26 nods. The awards will be given out on Sept 20, and stream­ing giant Net­flix dom­i­nated with 160 nom­i­na­tions – a new record for a sin­gle plat­form – on the strength of a pow­er­house line-up.</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • HBO’s Watch­men, an i nno­va­tive reimag­in­ing of a superhero graphic novel that tack­led racism in Amer­ica, topped the nom­i­na­tions for this year’s Emmy Awards on Tues­day with 26 nods.</p>
    <p>Peren­nial Ama­zon hit The Marvelous Mrs Maisel was tops among the come­dies with 20 nom­i­na­tions, fol­lowed by dark dra­mas Ozark and Suc­ces­sion at 18 each.</p>
    <p>Net­flix dom­i­nated with a whop­ping 160 nom­i­na­tions – a new record for a sin­gle plat­form – on the strength of a pow­er­house lineup that i ncludes Ozark and The Crown.</p>
    <p>The nom­i­na­tions were revealed dur­ing a live vir­tual cer­e­mony due to re­stric­tions re­lated to the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The awards show on Sept 20 will be the first or­gan­ised by Hol­ly­wood dur­ing the on­go­ing health cri­sis. Late night talk show host Jimmy Kim­mel is set to host the fes­tiv­i­ties, but it is un­clear what form the broad­cast on ABC will take.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the un­prece­dented chal­lenges fac­ing the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, it has been an ex­tra­or­di­nary year for tele­vi­sion,” said Tele­vi­sion Academy chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Frank Scherma.</p>
    <p>“We are hon­oured to be recog­nis­ing so many of the tal­ented pro­grammes, pro­duc­ers, di­rec­tors and crafts­peo­ple be­hind the re­mark­able sto­ry­telling that has brought us to­gether while we re­main apart,” he added.</p>
    <p>WATCH­MEN RES­ONATES</p>
    <p>Watch­men, a tale that has struck a chord with many view­ers in the light of on­go­ing protests against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity in many Amer­i­can cities, re­ceived nods for out­stand­ing lim­ited se­ries, as well as for stars Regina King and Jeremy Irons.</p>
    <p>“Watch­men is a great se­ries on its own, but it’s be­come even more res­o­nant in re­cent weeks and will likely have a big day in the lim­ited races,” Ms Joyce Eng, se­nior editor at awards track­ing web­site Gold Derby, said ahead of Tues­day’s an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Watch­men will com­pete in the best lim­ited se­ries cat­e­gory, against Lit­tle Fires Ev­ery­where, the adap­ta­tion of the pop­u­lar Ce­leste Ng book, equal rights saga Mrs Amer­ica, true crime story Un­be­liev­able and re­li­gious drama Unortho­dox.</p>
    <p>The Marvelous Mrs Maisel – Ama­zon’s story of a 1950s house­wife­turned-stand-up comic – re­ceived nods for out­stand­ing com­edy se­ries as well as for star Rachel Bros­na­han.</p>
    <p>Ozark stars Ja­son Bate­man, Laura Lin­ney and Julia Garner are in the run­ning, as are a mul­ti­tude of ac­tors from cut­throat busi­ness drama Suc­ces­sion, in­clud­ing Brian Cox, who is one of the favourites in the lead ac­tor cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Os­car win­ner Olivia Col­man is hotly tipped to win an Emmy for her por­trayal of Queen El­iz­a­beth II in Net­flix’s The Crown.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, new­comer Ap­ple TV+ nabbed its first nom­i­na­tions, with Jen­nifer Anis­ton, Steve Carell and Billy Crudup all earn­ing act­ing nods for the plat­form’s flag­ship launch pro­gramme The Morn­ing Show.</p>
    <p>DI­VER­SITY</p>
    <p>Of the more than 100 act­ing nom­i­na­tions in the se­ries, lim­ited se­ries and tele­vi­sion movie cat­e­gories, more than a third of them went to black ac­tors – a new record.</p>
    <p>Among them are Billy Porter (Pose), Ster­ling K. Brown (This Is Us and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel), Issa Rae (In­se­cure) and Regina King (Watch­men).</p>
    <p>The in­creased num­ber of nom­i­na­tions for black per­form­ers con­firmed ef­forts by the Tele­vi­sion Academy to boost racial di­ver­sity on the small screen.</p>
    <p>“Black Lives Mat­ter. Black Sto­ries Mat­ter,” the Academy tweeted on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Emmy nom­i­na­tions an­nounce­ment comes amid a na­tional reck­on­ing over race in the United States af­ter the May 25 death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an African Amer­i­can, when he was be­ing ar­rested by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“This type of rep­re­sen­ta­tion is a long time com­ing. There’s no short­age of tal­ent within the black com­mu­nity,” ac­tor Yahya Ab­dulMa­teen II, a nom­i­nee for Watch­men, told En­ter­tain­ment Tonight.</p>
    <p>“Some­times it takes cer­tain cir­cum­stances in the world for peo­ple to open their eyes and peo­ple to open up, to widen their pe­riph­ery.”</p>
    <p>The Tele­vi­sion Academy’s 23,000 vot­ing mem­bers were given a record num­ber of en­tries to sift through this year – and pre­sum­ably had plenty of free time to watch tele­vi­sion while cooped up at home due to coron­avirus lock­down mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Covid has ob­vi­ously can­celled in-per­son events, so there’s been no face-to-face schmooz­ing this year,” Ms Eng said.</p>
