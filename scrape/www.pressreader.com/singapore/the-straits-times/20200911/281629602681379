    <p>Mr Liew Mun Leong, 74, be­gan his ca­reer build­ing army camps, be­fore mov­ing on to air­port run­ways and ter­mi­nals, and chair­ing the Changi Air­port Group (CAG).</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing with a de­gree in civil en­gi­neer­ing from the then Univer­sity of Singapore in 1970, he landed a job at the Na­tional Iron and Steel Mills.</p>
    <p>Barely half a year later, he was called up for na­tional ser­vice and, at the De­fence Min­istry, was tasked with de­vel­op­ing and build­ing mil­i­tary camps and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times last year, he re­counted work­ing closely with Old Guard min­is­ter Goh Keng Swee and other men­tors, from whom he learnt the art of “dis­re­gard­ing the rules and get­ting things done”.</p>
    <p>He joined the Pub­lic Works Depart­ment in the mid-1970s, where he was in­volved in the build­ing of Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nals 1 and 2 from day one. “I don’t cir­cum­vent rules. I break ground,” he said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter more than two decades in the pub­lic sec­tor, in­clud­ing a stint at the Singapore In­sti­tute of Stan­dards and In­dus­trial Re­search, he steered en­gi­neer­ing and con­struc­tion firm L&M In­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>He left to be­come pres­i­dent of Pidemco Land in 1996.</p>
    <p>In 2000, when Cap­i­taLand was born from a merger be­tween Pidemco Land and DBS Land, he be­came its chief and led it to be one of the largest real es­tate groups in</p>
    <p>Asia. He stepped down as Cap­i­taLand chief ex­ec­u­tive in 2012.</p>
    <p>He was ap­pointed found­ing chair­man of CAG in 2009, and of Sur­bana in 2013.</p>
    <p>He was also a se­nior in­ter­na­tional busi­ness ad­viser ap­pointed by Te­masek to ad­vise the Singapore in­vest­ment com­pany on long-term real es­tate in­vest­ments in New York, London and Tokyo, and was ap­pointed a board mem­ber of its phil­an­thropic arm, Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
