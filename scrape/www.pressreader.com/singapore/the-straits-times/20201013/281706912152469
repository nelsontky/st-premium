    <p>A re­cip­ro­cal green lane with In­done­sia is the lat­est ad­di­tion to the ar­range­ments Sin­ga­pore has made with coun­tries to re­lax travel re­stric­tions. Here are the ar­range­ments so far:</p>
    <p>TIER 1: UNI­LAT­ERAL OPEN­INGS</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has uni­lat­er­ally opened its bor­ders to trav­ellers from Brunei and New Zealand (from Sept 1), as well as Viet­nam and Aus­tralia ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state (from Oct 8). Such open­ings are a stand­ing in­vi­ta­tion from Sin­ga­pore to these coun­tries, which have com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tems and have suc­cess­fully con­trolled the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors have to ap­ply for the Air Travel Pass that al­lows all forms of short-term travel, in­clud­ing leisure travel. They have to take a swab test upon ar­rival, and can go about their ac­tiv­i­ties af­ter they get a neg­a­tive test re­sult.</p>
    <p>They will have to use the TraceTo­gether app dur­ing their stay here, among other con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also plans to ne­go­ti­ate air travel bub­bles with safe coun­tries or re­gions – an ar­range­ment for gen­eral trav­ellers that does not re­quire a con­trolled itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>TIER 2: BI­LAT­ERAL GREEN LANES</p>
    <p>China (from June 8)</p>
    <p>China was the first coun­try to es­tab­lish a green lane with Sin­ga­pore. The ar­range­ment ap­plies to Shang­hai, Tian­jin, Chongqing, Guang­dong, Jiangsu and Zhe­jiang. It will grad­u­ally be ex­panded to other prov­inces and mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Malaysia (from Aug 17)</p>
    <p>Two schemes are in place: The Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane, for short-term es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial trav­ellers; and the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment, for longer-term travel for work and busi­ness-re­lated travel.</p>
    <p>But the Health Min­istry an­nounced yes­ter­day that trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from Sabah from 11.59pm to­mor­row, in­clud­ing those un­der the two schemes, have to serve 14-day stay-home no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There are also re­cip­ro­cal green lanes with Brunei (from Sept 1), South Korea (from Sept 4), Ja­pan (from Sept 18) and In­done­sia (ap­pli­ca­tions to be­gin on Oct 26).</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing for cer­tain places, such as Thai­land and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>TIER 3: STRICT MEA­SURES FOR HARD-HIT COUN­TRIES</p>
    <p>Given the sever­ity of the pan­demic in some coun­tries, trav­ellers from these places have to serve a 14-day quar­an­tine at ded­i­cated gov­ern­ment fa­cil­i­ties and take a swab test be­fore the end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
