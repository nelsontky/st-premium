    <p>Newly minted MP Yeo Wan Ling has joined the NTUC as a di­rec­tor in two of its de­part­ments, The Straits Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>A National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) spokesman told ST yes­ter­day that Ms Yeo, 44, joined on Mon­day and is di­rec­tor of its small and medium-sized en­ter­prise (SME) arm called U SME, and its Women and Fam­ily Unit.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo, an MP for Pasir RisPung­gol GRC, was pre­vi­ously the chief ex­ec­u­tive of so­cial en­ter­prise Care­giver Asia.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, she was part of the global op­er­a­tions team at the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB).</p>
    <p>The NTUC spokesman said that as with all new se­nior staff mem­bers, Ms Yeo will en­gage with its af­fil­i­ated unions and as­so­ci­a­tions so as to bet­ter un­der­stand and speak up on ground con­cerns.</p>
    <p>As di­rec­tor of U SME, she will work with SMEs and tri­par­tite part­ners to boost their pro­duc­tiv­ity and im­prove the wages, wel­fare and work prospects of SME em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Her role in the Women and Fam­ily Unit will be to strengthen the labour move­ment’s outreach to women, and work on pro­tect­ing their liveli­hoods as well as sup­port­ing their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Join­ing NTUC was a nat­u­ral ex­ten­sion of Ms Yeo’s pre­vi­ous work, said its spokesman, who noted that at Care­giver Asia, the first-term MP had the chance to work closely with a largely fe­male free­lanc­ing base. This at­tuned her to their con­cerns and as­pi­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>At EDB, Ms Yeo worked closely with SMEs both in Sin­ga­pore as well as over­seas, across var­i­ous in­dus­tries like man­u­fac­tur­ing and IT, added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“(Ms Yeo) is look­ing for­ward to con­nect even more with these worker groups, ad­vo­cate for their in­ter­ests and de­velop pro­grammes that will pro­tect them, pre­serve their jobs, and pro­vide care and sup­port for those in need, es­pe­cially dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo joins the ranks of Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) labour MPs, who in­clude Pioneer MP Pa­trick Tay and Radin Mas MP Melvin Yong, who are both as­sis­tant sec­re­taries-gen­eral.</p>
    <p>She is the sec­ond first-term PAP MP to join NTUC. Marine Pa­rade GRC MP Mohd Fahmi Ali­man, 48, joined in April as a di­rec­tor of its Ad­min­is­tra­tion and Re­search Unit.</p>
