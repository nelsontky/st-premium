    <p>• Pro-democ­racy ac­tivists tus­sled with po­lice i n Bangkok yes­ter­day when demon­stra­tors gath­ered out­side a po­lice sta­tion in a show of sup­port for protest lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Scores of ac­tivists re­moved a steel bar­ri­cade as they tried to move closer to the Sam­ran­rat po­lice sta­tion, where the lead­ers had gone to an­swer sum­monses. They faced mul­ti­ple charges in­clud­ing vi­o­lat­ing Ar­ti­cle 116, which cov­ers sedi­tion, and breach­ing Covid-19 re­stric­tions on pub­lic gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>“Please don’t do this, we are look­ing af­ter the sit­u­a­tion,” po­lice said over loud­speak­ers as ac­tivists pushed through metal fences. One threw a bucket of paint, cov­er­ing an of­fi­cer in blue.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tors have re­turned to Thai­land’s streets to call for the re­moval of the gov­ern­ment of 2014 coup leader Prayut Chan-o-cha af­ter a dis­puted election last year, re­viv­ing mem­o­ries of more than a decade of un­rest prior to the coup.</p>
    <p>“This fight has to end with our gen­er­a­tion,” one ac­tivist at yes­ter­day’s protest said. The sit­u­a­tion eased when the au­thor­i­ties agreed to have the group move closer to the build­ing and hold a small rally.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut said on Wed­nes­day the coun­try would be “en­gulfed in flames” if the sit­u­a­tion per­sisted, his most se­ri­ous warn­ing yet.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has seen a month of near-daily ral­lies led by stu­dents call­ing for his re­moval, a new Con­sti­tu­tion and a new election, with some events draw­ing more than 10,000 pro­test­ers. Pro­test­ers are also call­ing for re­form of the royal in­sti­tu­tion, with stu­dent lead­ers on Wed­nes­day sub­mit­ting a list of de­mands for the monar­chy to a par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>So far, more than a dozen ac­tivists have been ar­rested on var­i­ous charges, in­clud­ing sedi­tion, over the street protests.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have vowed to move ahead with a planned demon­stra­tion on Sept 19, the an­niver­sary of an ear­lier mil­i­tary coup in 2006, and a pro-gov­ern­ment protest is planned for this Sun­day.</p>
