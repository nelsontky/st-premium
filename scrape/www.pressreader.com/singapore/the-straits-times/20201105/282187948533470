    <p>The num­ber of smok­ing-re­lated complaints in Hous­ing Board (HDB) ar­eas went up to 1,290 in the first nine months of this year, eclips­ing the 216 made in the whole of 2017, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Na­tional Developmen­t Sim Ann yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of complaints has been in­creas­ing each year.</p>
    <p>There were 370 in 2018, and 710 last year. Ms Sim added that the au­thor­i­ties were un­able to de­ter­mine whether these cases oc­curred in com­mon ar­eas or else­where, in her re­sponse to a ques­tion from Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) on the amount of feed­back that has been given re­gard­ing sec­ond-hand smoke in peo­ple’s homes.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment last month, Mr Ng called for a ban on res­i­dents smok­ing near their win­dows or on the balconies of their homes.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim said that this year, HDB re­ceived some 600 complaints on so­cial dis­ameni­ties such as cig­a­rette smoke, noise, foul smells and dis­putes with neigh­bours each month from Jan­uary to March.</p>
    <p>“This in­creased to about 2,100 cases of feed­back per month from April to July 2020, as more peo­ple worked or stud­ied from home due to the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures,” she noted.</p>
    <p>“From Au­gust 2020 on­wards, likely due to the re­turn of chil­dren to school and more em­ploy­ees to work­places, the num­ber of feed­back per month has fallen to about 1,500.”</p>
    <p>In con­trast, from 2015 to last year, HDB re­ceived an av­er­age of about 3,400 re­ports on so­cial dis­ameni­ties per year – an av­er­age of around 280 per month.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim said that go­ing for­ward, the Gov­ern­ment in­tends to track dis­putes be­tween neigh­bours more closely, with the aim of pro­mot­ing har­mo­nious liv­ing and strength­en­ing com­mu­nity norms.</p>
