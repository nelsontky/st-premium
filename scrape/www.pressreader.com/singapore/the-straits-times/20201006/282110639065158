    <p>Statis­tics and stud­ies over the years show the death penalty has had a de­ter­rent ef­fect on some se­ri­ous crimes here, said Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­ci­dents of rob­bery with firearms and kid­nap­ping, and vol­umes of drugs traf­ficked fell af­ter the death penalty was in­tro­duced for these of­fences, he added.</p>
    <p>Dis­clos­ing these find­ings in a writ­ten re­ply to Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC), Mr Shan­mugam said in con­sid­er­ing what pun­ish­ments to mete out, it was im­por­tant to con­sider the rights of of­fend­ers, vic­tims and Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment has the re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­sure the safety and se­cu­rity of Sin­ga­pore­ans, while main­tain­ing a fair and just crim­i­nal justice sys­tem,” he added.</p>
    <p>“The ap­proach we have taken has re­sulted in Sin­ga­pore be­ing one of the safest places in the world to live. This is some­thing deeply val­ued by Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim had asked if the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) had done any stud­ies com­par­ing the de­ter­rent ef­fect of a life sen­tence rel­a­tive to the death penalty, and if such stud­ies looked at of­fend­ers with men­tal ill­nesses or ad­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>The death penalty is im­posed here for in­ten­tional mur­der, drug traf­fick­ing, ter­ror­ist bomb­ing and firearms use, among other crimes.</p>
    <p>‘STRONG DE­TER­RENT EF­FECT’</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said there was some ev­i­dence that traf­fick­ers brought in smaller amounts of opium and cannabis af­ter the manda­tory death penalty was in­tro­duced in 1990, to avoid trig­ger­ing the cap­i­tal sen­tence.</p>
    <p>In the four-year pe­riod af­ter 1990, the av­er­age net weight of opium traf­ficked fell by 66 per cent.</p>
    <p>The prob­a­bil­ity of traf­fick­ers choos­ing to bring in more than 500g of cannabis – the death penalty thresh­old – also fell by 15 to 19 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>An MHA study of convicted drug of­fend­ers also found that traf­fick­ers who were aware and mind­ful of the se­vere le­gal con­se­quences had lim­ited their traf­fick­ing be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Among of­fend­ers who were not traf­fick­ers, 85.1 per cent felt the death penalty had a de­ter­rent ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said: “This points to re­stric­tive de­ter­rence, as traf­fick­ing ac­tiv­i­ties were in­ten­tion­ally lim­ited when there was greater aware­ness of sanc­tions.”</p>
    <p>He also cited fig­ures on rob­beries with firearms and kid­nap­pings as an in­di­ca­tion of the “strong de­ter­rent ef­fect” of the death penalty.</p>
    <p>Rob­beries with firearms fell from a peak of 174 in 1973, when the death penalty was in­tro­duced, to 106 the next year – a drop of 39 per cent. Since then, such cases have be­come rare in Sin­ga­pore, with no cases re­ported in the last 13 years.</p>
    <p>Kid­nap­ping cases also fell from an av­er­age of 29 a year for the three years be­fore the death penalty was in­tro­duced in 1961 to one case in 1961. Since then, such crimes have not ex­ceeded two cases per year, ex­cept for six cases in 1964 and three cases in 2003.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said sur­veys also in­di­cate that Sin­ga­pore­ans and for­eign­ers be­lieve the death penalty is more ef­fec­tive in dis­cour­ag­ing peo­ple from com­mit­ting se­ri­ous crimes, com­pared with life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>An MHA sur­vey of 2,000 res­i­dents on at­ti­tudes to­wards cap­i­tal pun­ish­ment found that 70.8 per cent of re­spon­dents be­lieved the death penalty had dis­cour­aged the use of firearms. For mur­der, this fig­ure was 70.6 per cent, and for drug traf­fick­ing, 68 per cent.</p>
    <p>An­other 2018 study, fo­cused on for­eign­ers who are likely to visit Sin­ga­pore and thus en­counter the laws here, had sim­i­lar find­ings. Among those polled, 84 per cent be­lieved the death penalty to be more ef­fec­tive in dis­cour­ag­ing traf­fick­ing of drugs into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam noted that some ten­ta­tive con­clu­sions can be drawn, though the stud­ies had to be taken in con­text and more work has to be done over pe­ri­ods of time.</p>
    <p>MA­JOR­ITY PUB­LIC SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>He also cited sec­tions 84 and 85 of the Pe­nal Code as pro­vid­ing de­fences for of­fend­ers whose rea­son­ing ca­pac­ity may be af­fected by men­tal ill­ness or ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>He added that var­i­ous sur­veys have shown there is ma­jor­ity pub­lic sup­port for the death penalty.</p>
    <p>He said that while the quan­ti­ties of drugs that at­tract the death penalty for traf­fick­ing may not seem high, they are sig­nif­i­cant enough to be ca­pa­ble of “bring­ing death, or at least a life of ruin, to a large num­ber of abusers and their fam­i­lies”.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, 15g of pure heroin makes up 1,250 straws and can feed the habit of 180 abusers for a week.</p>
    <p>In de­cid­ing whether to ap­ply the death penalty to of­fences, Mr Shan­mugam said the Gov­ern­ment takes into ac­count three key con­sid­er­a­tions, among oth­ers. They are: the se­ri­ous­ness of the of­fence, in terms of how much harm it will cause to the vic­tim and to so­ci­ety; how fre­quent or wide­spread the of­fence is; and the need for de­ter­rence.</p>
    <p>These are con­sid­ered in to­tal­ity, and the fact that an of­fence is not wide­spread now, for in­stance, may not by it­self be a de­ci­sive fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam also in­vited Prof Lim “to share with MHA whether he is sup­port­ive of the death penalty, for what of­fences and why”, adding it would be use­ful to hear his rea­sons if he does not sup­port it. “The Mem­ber’s views will be given care­ful and re­spect­ful con­sid­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr K. Shan­mugam said sur­veys also in­di­cate that Sin­ga­pore­ans and for­eign­ers be­lieve the death penalty is more ef­fec­tive in dis­cour­ag­ing peo­ple from com­mit­ting such crimes, com­pared with life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
