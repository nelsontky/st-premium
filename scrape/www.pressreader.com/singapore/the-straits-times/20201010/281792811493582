    <p>Madam R. Kam­leshrani, a teacher at a pri­mary school in Se­lan­gor, has seen a 50 per cent drop in at­ten­dance in her class.</p>
    <p>Six­teen of her pupils have stopped at­tend­ing classes over wor­ries that they could be­come in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the Malaysian gov­ern­ment main­tain­ing that it will not shut­ter schools na­tion­wide amid an alarm­ing spike in the num­ber of cases, even in schools.</p>
    <p>“Many par­ents have ex­pressed their con­cern, so they took the lib­erty to stop send­ing their kids to school,” the 47-year-old teacher told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Her pupils are not the only ones. Madam Za­harah Ibrahim, 49, whose 12-year-old son goes to a pri­mary school in Kuala Lumpur, said no one from his class turned up this week, de­spite the school re­port­ing no cases.</p>
    <p>“I am keep­ing my kids at home for at least two weeks,” she said.</p>
    <p>A school in Kuala Lumpur’s Bangsar sub­urb re­mained open yes­ter­day even af­ter it re­ported two</p>
    <p>cases among stu­dents on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, none of its stu­dents showed up yes­ter­day. The school later an­nounced it would be closed un­til Oct 16 for dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>On his Face­book page yes­ter­day, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin</p>
    <p>said the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil agreed that the Education Min­istry should be able to is­sue an or­der to close any school, with­out await­ing for the go-ahead from the Heath Min­istry, if any­one tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>An in­for­mal poll in a Face­book</p>
    <p>group of Malaysian par­ents of pri­mary school pupils this week showed that an over­whelm­ing num­ber – 1,304 – voted for schools to be closed, with only 251 against.</p>
    <p>Man­ager Ivy Sam, 41, is among those who want schools to stay open.</p>
    <p>“If places of work can still be open, then schools should be too. On­line learning puts a lot of stress on par­ents and it is not as ef­fec­tive as face-to-face learning,” she said.</p>
    <p>Many par­ents, though, have de­cided to keep their chil­dren at home as a third wave grips the na­tion, re­sort­ing to teach­ing them at home or al­low­ing them to self­s­tudy. Some schools have gone back to of­fer­ing on­line classes.</p>
    <p>Only schools in red zones, or dis­tricts with more than 40 cases, will be closed.</p>
    <p>But con­cerns are grow­ing af­ter Malaysia started record­ing tripledigi­t cases daily since l ate l ast month, soar­ing to a record high of 691 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia recorded 354 new cases and six new deaths yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Many of the cases can be traced to peo­ple who trav­elled to Sabah, where sev­eral dis­tricts are un­der lock­down.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing statewide polls i n Sabah on Sept 26, the virus has spread to other states, and at least nine gov­ern­ment schools and one in­ter­na­tional school were af­fected over the last two weeks.</p>
    <p>Six hun­dred stu­dents in Pe­nang had to un­dergo screen­ing af­ter be­ing ex­posed to an in­fected teacher who had pre­vi­ously trav­elled to</p>
    <p>Sabah with her hus­band, a politi­cian, for the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But teach­ers face a quandary in how to en­sure their stu­dents are not left be­hind, even as they stay safe from the virus.</p>
    <p>“My con­cern now is how do we keep the kids safe, and also fin­ish the syl­labus? In my per­sonal ca­pac­ity, I’ve pre­pared an on­line learning mod­ule to help those who are stay­ing home,” said Madam Kam­leshrani.</p>
    <p>“And since kids get bored re­ally eas­ily, I de­cided to make it more in­ter­ac­tive and fun, it will in­volve some phys­i­cal move­ments while count­ing and an­swer­ing ques­tions.”</p>
    <p>Senior Min­is­ter in charge of Education Radzi Jidin said any de­ci­sion on the clo­sure of schools will be made based on an in-depth analysis of ex­ist­ing data and de­tailed dis­cus­sions with the Min­istry of Health and the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>“I have re­ceived many views and sug­ges­tions from var­i­ous par­ties on the need to close schools when there is an in­crease in the num­ber of Covid-19 cases,” he said in a Face­book post on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“We are con­stantly mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion in schools through­out the coun­try.”</p>
