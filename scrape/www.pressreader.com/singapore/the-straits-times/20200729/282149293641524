    <p>Im­proved mar­ket con­di­tions helped send earn­ings soar­ing at Great Eastern Hold­ings in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>It re­ported net profit of $297.5 mil­lion for the three months to June 30, 76 per cent higher than the $169 mil­lion of a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>This was due to higher op­er­at­ing profit and an in­crease in the val­u­a­tion of in­vest­ments as a re­sult of bet­ter fi­nan­cial mar­ket con­di­tions dur­ing the quar­ter, the in­sur­ance arm of OCBC Bank said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>GE said op­er­at­ing profit net of tax from the in­sur­ance busi­ness rose 16 per cent to $185.7 mil­lion while non-op­er­at­ing profit was $35 mil­lion, rev­ers­ing from a loss of $23.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Profit net of tax from share­hold­ers’ fund came in at $85.3 mil­lion, more than double the $36.6 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>To­tal weighted new sales fell 4 per cent to $286.1 mil­lion on the back of re­stricted sales ac­tiv­i­ties, par­tic­u­larly from the ban­cas­sur­ance chan­nel.</p>
    <p>New busi­ness em­bed­ded value was down 28 per cent to $109.1 mil­lion, from $151.4 mil­lion a year ago, due mainly to l ower sales i n Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Net profit for the first half fell 35 per cent to $331.4 mil­lion amid un­favourable mar­ket con­di­tions in the first quar­ter, GE said.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings per share was 70 cents for the first half, down 35 per cent from $1.08 in the pre­ced­ing year.</p>
    <p>Strong growth in the Sin­ga­pore busi­ness sent to­tal weighted new sales for the first half up 7 per cent to $584.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, profit net of tax from share­hold­ers’ fund de­clined 73 per cent to $43.4 mil­lion while new busi­ness em­bed­ded value fell 10 per cent to $235.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The board de­clared an in­terim div­i­dend of 10 cents a share for the fi­nan­cial year end­ing Dec 31, 2020. This will be paid on Aug 26, af­ter books clo­sure on Aug 14.</p>
    <p>Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Khor Hock Seng said sales in GE’s core mar­kets i n the sec­ond quar­ter were af­fected by tighter move­ment re­stric­tions im­ple­mented amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ban­cas­sur­ance chan­nel was sig­nif­i­cantly im­pacted as sales ac­tiv­i­ties, which were largely con­ducted at bank branches, were curbed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, GE’s agency force here adapted swiftly to op­er­at­ing dig­i­tally, help­ing cush­ion the im­pact, noted Mr Khor.</p>
    <p>GE ex­pects the eco­nomic out­look to be chal­leng­ing, with volatil­ity in the fi­nan­cial mar­kets and low in­ter­est rates, which could im­pact per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Great Eastern shares closed down 0.4 per cent at $19.45 yes­ter­day.</p>
