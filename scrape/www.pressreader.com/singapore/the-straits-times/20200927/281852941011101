    <p>There is a grow­ing un­der­stand­ing among po­lit­i­cal pun­dits that Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo is po­si­tion­ing him­self for a run at the White House in 2024.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo is more a hard­liner than a diplo­mat on na­tional se­cu­rity is­sues, and has come to be seen as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s most pow­er­ful ally.</p>
    <p>Those who know him have lit­tle doubt about his po­lit­i­cal am­bi­tion, which he im­plies in pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions, for­mer diplo­mats say.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s re­cent the­atri­cal ap­pear­ance at the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion – beam­ing in from a rooftop in Jerusalem to sup­port Mr Trump – was both loaded with sym­bol­ism and un­prece­dented for a sec­re­tary of state, and only sup­ported the spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Last week, he made a ma­jor speech in Wis­con­sin, on the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s China pol­icy.</p>
    <p>While mak­ing for­eign pol­icy speeches to do­mes­tic au­di­ences is not un­usual – es­pe­cially in a sys­tem in which states have their own re­la­tion­ships with for­eign buy­ers and in­vestors – such speeches also help to keep him vis­i­ble do­mes­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>“He is vi­o­lat­ing ev­ery norm by cam­paign­ing while he is sec­re­tary of state,” said a for­mer diplo­mat, who spoke to The Sun­day Times on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>“It’s very clear that he is run­ning in 2024 and he wants to make sure he can be seen as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>“He will have to face Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and (for­mer US am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions) Nikki Ha­ley, and is try­ing to po­si­tion him­self.”</p>
    <p>In May, the New York Times re­ported that Mr Pom­peo made a quiet trip in Jan­uary to a Florida re­tire­ment en­clave pop­u­lated by prom­i­nent Repub­li­can donors dur­ing the tail end of a diplo­matic trip to Latin Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>He had a sim­i­larly quiet meet­ing last De­cem­ber with Repub­li­can donors over a din­ner on a State Depart­ment trip to Lon­don, the pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>And last Oc­to­ber, he met Repub­li­can bil­lion­aire and long-time sup­porter Charles Koch while on an of­fi­cial visit to Kansas, his home state.</p>
    <p>He was for a time con­sid­ered a can­di­date for the Kansas Se­nate seat but did not run, and has in pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions im­plied that he is wait­ing for some­thing big­ger in 2024.</p>
    <p>He is try­ing to ce­ment his cre­den­tials, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who work with him are say­ing the rea­son he wants an Afghanista­n so­lu­tion is he can take credit for it, be­cause he has oth­er­wise not been par­tic­u­larly suc­cess­ful,” said the for­mer diplo­mat who spoke to ST.</p>
    <p>“The re­cent agree­ments be­tween Is­rael and Bahrain and the United Arab Emi­rates were not his achieve­ments. They were Jared Kush­ner’s.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kush­ner, the Pres­i­dent’s sonin-law, was put in charge of mak­ing peace in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Pom­peo, how­ever, di­plo­macy has “shriv­elled”, Dr Robert Man­ning, res­i­dent se­nior fel­low at the At­lantic Coun­cil’s Scowcroft Cen­tre for Strat­egy and Se­cu­rity, told ST.</p>
    <p>Morale in the State Depart­ment is</p>
    <p>“down in the dumps”, a for­mer State Depart­ment of­fi­cial said on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ma­jor posts re­main va­cant un­der a trim­ming ex­er­cise not en­tirely due to Mr Pom­peo, who took over in 2018. It was started by his pre­de­ces­sor Rex Tiller­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo is mind­ful of his con­stituency. He keeps an open Bi­ble in his of­fice, marked at the page he has read that day.</p>
    <p>“I need my mind re­newed with truth each day,” he told an au­di­ence of the Amer­i­can As­so­ci­a­tion of Chris­tian Coun­sel­lors in a speech last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The for­mer diplo­mat source said: “Like all politi­cians who want to cul­ti­vate a re­li­gious po­lit­i­cal base, he wants to show his re­li­gios­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo also be­lieves in the “rap­ture” – a be­lief of some evan­gel­i­cal Chris­tians that there will be an apoc­a­lyp­tic war, Je­sus will re­turn and true Chris­tians will be rap­tured or as­cend to heaven.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo has time on his side – he is only 56. And he has a pow­er­ful re­sume. He grad­u­ated at the top of his class at West Point, was a tank of­fi­cer in Europe, went to Har­vard Law School, launched a suc­cess­ful aero­space busi­ness and got elected to Congress in 2010 from Kansas as a Tea Party Repub­li­can.</p>
    <p>For more than a year, be­fore Pres­i­dent Trump ap­pointed him sec­re­tary of state, Mr Pom­peo ran the Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency.</p>
