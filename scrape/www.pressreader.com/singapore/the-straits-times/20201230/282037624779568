    <p>Pa­tients may now have a better idea of what they should be pay­ing when served by pri­vate sec­tor anaes­thetists and doc­tors pro­vid­ing in­pa­tient con­sul­ta­tion, fol­low­ing the re­lease of fee bench­marks by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s list shows rec­om­mended fee ranges for about 190 pro­ce­dures con­ducted by anaes­thetists, as well as sug­gested charges for con­sul­ta­tions and reviews of pa­tients in dif­fer­ent ward set­tings by pri­vate sec­tor doc­tors.</p>
    <p>“The fee bench­marks will give pa­tients and pay­ers more com­plete in­for­ma­tion on the rea­son­able range of doc­tors’ fees for (op­er­a­tions) and hospi­tal stays and en­able better-in­formed de­ci­sions,” said MOH in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>It added that the bench­marks should also serve as a guide for pri­vate sec­tor health­care providers to charge ap­pro­pri­ately.</p>
    <p>For the re­moval of an ap­pendix, the rec­om­mended fee for pri­vate sec­tor anaes­thetists is be­tween $1,130 and $1,800 be­fore goods and ser­vices tax (GST).</p>
    <p>The fee is cur­rently around $1,500 to $1,750 in­clud­ing GST, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>In the case of a to­tal knee re­place­ment for one leg, the bench­mark rec­om­mends that they charge be­tween $1,670 and $2,400 be­fore GST.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate sec­tor anaes­thetists cur­rently charge around $2,140 to $2,675 in­clud­ing GST.</p>
    <p>The fee bench­marks were rec­om­mended by the Fee Bench­marks Ad­vi­sory Com­mit­tee (FBAC) and ac­cepted in full by MOH last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said the ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee’s fee ranges take into ac­count the anaes­the­sia risks as­so­ci­ated with the surgery and any added com­plex­ity aris­ing from the pa­tient’s con­di­tion, in­de­pen­dent of the sur­gi­cal com­plex­ity of the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee also sought to en­sure that fees charged are fair and rea­son­able and com­men­su­rate with the anaes­thetist’s risks and ef­forts, said MOH.</p>
    <p>It added that the ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee had re­viewed data such as his­tor­i­cal trans­acted fees and in­fla­tion rates, and con­sulted nu­mer­ous stake­hold­ers over 10 ses­sions held last month and this month.</p>
    <p>The stake­hold­ers com­prised about 200 spe­cial­ists from the Col­lege of Anaes­the­si­ol­o­gists, Sin­ga­pore, rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the pro­fes­sional bod­ies, pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als, as well as in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>“These help to en­sure that the bench­marks re­flect a fair range of pro­fes­sional fees that are rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the risks and ef­fort un­der­taken by doc­tors, while bal­anc­ing other stake­hold­ers’ in­ter­ests and per­spec­tives,” said MOH.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new in­pa­tient at­ten­dance fee bench­marks, it is rec­om­mended that dur­ing of­fice hours, doc­tors in the gen­eral ward charge $200 to $400 a day, those in the high-de­pen­dency unit charge $250 to $500 a day and those in the in­ten­sive care unit deal­ing with lower-in­ten­sity cases charge $300 to $600 a day.</p>
    <p>MOH said the de­vel­op­ment of fee bench­marks for pri­vate health­care providers is part of a larger strat­egy to en­sure health­care costs re­main af­ford­able and to keep Sin­ga­pore’s health­care sys­tem sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond set of fee bench­marks pub­lished by the min­istry, fol­low­ing the sur­geon fee bench­marks for com­mon sur­gi­cal pro­ce­dures pub­lished in 2018.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim Yean Teng, chair­man of the ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee, said that fol­low­ing the pub­li­ca­tion of the first set of fee bench­marks, a ma­jor­ity of doc­tors started charg­ing within the rec­om­mended bench­marks, which helped mod­er­ate the growth of health­care costs here.</p>
    <p>“For the fee bench­marks to be ef­fec­tive, the FBAC en­cour­ages all stake­hold­ers to use them rea­son­ably as a ref­er­ence for fair charg­ing and pay­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>The full list of fee bench­marks can be found at www.moh.gov.sg/ bills and fees</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced that it had ap­pointed new mem­bers to the FBAC to ad­vise on the re­view of pub­lished fee bench­marks and de­velop ad­di­tional ar­eas of fee bench­marks from next year.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the ap­point­ment of Dr Wee Siew Bock, a se­nior con­sul­tant and gen­eral sur­geon in pri­vate prac­tice, as chair­man of the com­mit­tee from July next year.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said: “The FBAC will con­tinue to be a di­verse group that rep­re­sents the in­ter­ests of var­i­ous stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the med­i­cal com­mu­nity and health­care providers, pay­ers from the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors, pa­tient ad­vo­cates and lay­men, and academia.”</p>
    <p>The fee bench­marks will give pa­tients and pay­ers more com­plete in­for­ma­tion on the rea­son­able range of doc­tors’ fees for (op­er­a­tions) and hospi­tal stays and en­able better-in­formed de­ci­sions. MIN­ISTRY OF HEALTH</p>
