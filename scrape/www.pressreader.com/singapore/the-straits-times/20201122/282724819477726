    <p>At the slight­est provo­ca­tion, say the school hol­i­days, Sin­ga­pore­ans pack up and leave town en masse. We es­cape our homes and our coun­try like bats out of hell, to parts near and far, as if suf­fer­ing se­ri­ous claus­tro­pho­bia.</p>
    <p>This mi­gra­tory pat­tern is al­most oblig­a­tory. How many times have peo­ple asked you where you are go­ing when you take time off work? Say “nowhere” and they look at you in shock, fol­lowed by sus­pi­cion. “Re­ally?”</p>
    <p>Liv­ing on a small is­land does that to peo­ple.</p>
    <p>So I imag­ine many of you are climb­ing the walls be­cause you are trapped here, un­able to in­dulge your wan­der­lust be­cause of this blasted pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But how many of us are se­cretly re­lieved?</p>
    <p>One of my friends, who trav­els a lot for work and l eisure, con­fesses that she likes not be­ing able to travel. She says she can fo­cus on two projects she is work­ing on, and which need ur­gent at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, I had din­ner at chef Jason Tan’s new restau­rant, Eupho­ria, in Tras Street. He, too, likes to travel far and wide. My meal was ex­cep­tional. The cook­ing, plat­ing, flavours, be­spoke cut­lery and crock­ery, decor; he and his part­ner had paid at­ten­tion to ev­ery de­tail. I can­not help but think he was able to do all this be­cause his wings are clipped, and he has lots of time to think things through.</p>
    <p>I am very re­lieved to not be able to travel for a while too. It’s a strange feel­ing. On one hand, I’m think­ing where I’ll go to first – Ja­pan, which I love? Tai­wan, a new ob­ses­sion? Ge­or­gia? The coun­try, not the Amer­i­can state. Morocco? I love go­ing places and ex­plor­ing them.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, I hate fly­ing. And not ev­ery air­port is clean and ef­fi­cient like Changi. Wait­ing in end­less lines at Cus­toms and im­mi­gra­tion else­where is hel­la­cious.</p>
    <p>Add to that the prospect of hav­ing to wear a mask through­out the flight, of en­hanced safety mea­sures, of trav­el­ling when there is no vac­cine for the Covid-19 virus, and my mind bog­gles. One of the con­se­quences of com­ing down with the virus is los­ing the senses of smell and taste. If that hap­pens to me, I can­not do my job. It’s that sim­ple.</p>
    <p>But stay­ing put need not be se­cond best. This pa­per has shown you all that you can en­joy in Sin­ga­pore, and we con­tinue to do that. When was the last time you stopped to re­ally look at how beau­ti­ful our home is? In our rush to be any­place but here, we miss so much.</p>
    <p>The school hol­i­days is a good time to make up for all that. A stay­ca­tion per­haps? Tak­ing a her­itage walk? Ex­plor­ing farms out in the boon­docks and buy­ing fresh pro­duce grown there? Cook­ing the pro­duce? Cy­cling with the kids in the park?</p>
    <p>You could also make bread.</p>
    <p>I am cur­rently on a bread­mak­ing ben­der that shows no sign of end­ing; it keeps my wan­der­lust at bay. This week, I pro­pose you make English muffins. It is not a big in­vest­ment in time or bread flour. The recipe makes enough for a small fam­ily with a cou­ple left over.</p>
    <p>You don’t need a stand mixer (although it does make things eas­ier) or even an oven. The muffins cook on the stove top.</p>
    <p>Best of all, it is an op­por­tu­nity to wean the kids off fast food. In­stead of tak­ing the path of least re­sis­tance, make them break­fast sand­wiches with from-scratch bread. You can pick the kind of cheese and ham you like, and the eggs can be done the way your fam­ily mem­bers like them.</p>
    <p>If that does not float your boat, you can al­ways have the English muffins with smoked salmon, cream cheese, dill and ca­pers; with honey and but­ter; with jam and but­ter; with kaya and but­ter. Never for­get the but­ter.</p>
    <p>Stop climb­ing the walls. What are you, a re­ject from Cirque du Soleil?</p>
    <p>Stay put and make English muffins.</p>
