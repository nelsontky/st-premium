    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>I built my physique through strength train­ing and nutri­tion. It takes a fair bit of de­ter­mi­na­tion and pa­tience. De­vel­op­ing an ath­letic physique re­quires having mus­cle mass and a low body fat per­cent­age.</p>
    <p>I have gone through sev­eral phases of “bulk­ing and cut­ting” to reach my cur­rent body com­po­si­tion. The jour­ney is on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a time when you were not fit and fab?</p>
    <p>When I was 18, I weighed only 52kg. I was re­ally un­der­weight at 170cm tall. And in 2016, I was laser­fo­cused on get­ting as strong as pos­si­ble for pow­er­lift­ing and aban­doned all di­etary re­straint. I hit 90kg with 25 to 30 per cent of body fat.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>I would de­scribe my diet as pro­tein-cen­tric flex­i­ble di­et­ing. I aim to con­sume at least 150g of pro­tein through var­i­ous sources such as meat and dairy prod­ucts and plant­based ones such as soya prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>I allow my­self flex­i­bil­ity to en­joy car­bo­hy­drate and fat, but try to mod­er­ate my in­take of pro­cessed foods.</p>
    <p>What are your in­dul­gences?</p>
    <p>I love bur­ri­tos, burg­ers, and Korean fried chicken. To me, they are not point­less in­dul­gences as they are all great sources of pro­tein.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>I am for­tu­nate as I have a fixed work sched­ule and can­not re­ally take work home with me. I al­lo­cate quite a bit of time to go to the gym. It is an ex­cel­lent out­let for me to de­stress, I get to so­cialise with my friends and it keeps me phys­i­cally healthy.</p>
    <p>What are the three most important things in your life?</p>
    <p>Whey pro­tein, cre­a­tine and pre­work­out – just kid­ding.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily, hap­pi­ness and health.</p>
    <p>What’s your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>My favourite mus­cle group to train is my core, as there are many in­ter­est­ing and chal­leng­ing ex­er­cises to do. My least favourite mus­cle group is my calves, as they refuse to grow no mat­ter what I do.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and after a workout?</p>
    <p>I make sure to warm up by do­ing lighter or eas­ier versions of the ex­er­cise I am in­tend­ing to do.</p>
    <p>I don’t have a cool-down rou­tine, but I do make sure to get a good amount of pro­tein and car­bo­hy­drates post-workout.</p>
    <p>How important is it for you to keep up with your fit­ness rou­tine?</p>
    <p>Pretty important. I get quite rest­less if I miss too many work­outs in a row. When trav­el­ling, I make it a point to get at least one workout in dur­ing the trip.</p>
    <p>How are you keep­ing fit dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>I have re­sumed train­ing in the gym with pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures in place. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, I built up a col­lec­tion of train­ing equip­ment and trained at home.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive life­style in­flu­enced your fam­ily and friends?</p>
    <p>My dad got into weight train­ing while I was train­ing at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. My friends of­ten try workout chal­lenges that I post on In­sta­gram. It is a great lit­tle fit­ness com­mu­nity where ev­ery­one mo­ti­vates one another.</p>
    <p>What’s the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fit­ness?</p>
    <p>I have done a back flip while swing­ing two ket­tle­bells over­head.</p>
    <p>I have trained to do back flips since my gym­nas­tics days in school, but adding weights was def­i­nitely tak­ing things a big step up. Do not try this at home.</p>
    <p>How ex­ten­sive is your col­lec­tion of sports-re­lated para­pher­na­lia?</p>
    <p>I have the full range of pow­er­lift­ing equip­ment – wrist wraps, knee sleeves, lift­ing belt, and spe­cial shoes for squats and dead­lifts.</p>
    <p>My col­lec­tion of home workout equip­ment is pretty com­pre­hen­sive as well. I have two pairs of par­al­lettes, por­ta­ble dip bars, a pull-up bar and an ex­er­cise bench and dumb­bells.</p>
    <p>Would you go surgery?</p>
    <p>for plas­tic</p>
    <p>I don’t think I would, as I am pretty happy with how I look. How­ever, if chang­ing your ap­pear­ance makes you feel more con­fi­dent, there is noth­ing wrong with go­ing for it.</p>
    <p>If the change you de­sire is some­thing that can be ac­com­plished through diet and ex­er­cise, then it is much more re­ward­ing to work for it.</p>
    <p>Do you think you’re sexy?</p>
    <p>Def­i­nitely. I am strong, em­pow­ered, ex­u­ber­ant and youth­ful. I have fit­ness to thank for most of that.</p>
