    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has other in­dus­trial es­tates mooted for re­ju­ve­na­tion such as Yishun and Kal­lang-Ko­lam Ayer, Sungei Kadut stands out for its his­tor­i­cal marsh­land set­ting and prox­im­ity to key na­ture re­serves.</p>
    <p>Own­ers of in­dus­trial prop­er­ties in the area wel­come the com­pre­hen­sive mas­ter­plan and are al­ready gear­ing up for the move.</p>
    <p>SEN WAN TIM­BER</p>
    <p>Mr Ash­ton Chan, the sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion owner of one of Sin­ga­pore’s largest sup­pli­ers of tim­ber and ply­wood, started dig­i­tal­is­ing its op­er­a­tions in Sungei Kadut four years ago and has plans to at­tract younger tal­ent to join the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“For busi­nesses like us, we can no longer hide be­hind be­ing just B2B (busi­ness-to-busi­ness). We must also go B2C (busi­ness-to-con­sumer),” says Mr Chan, 49.</p>
    <p>“For that, we need a site like Sungei Kadut that is multi-pur­pose where, even at night, you still have peo­ple here en­joy­ing recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties,” he says, ref­er­enc­ing the new plans for a vi­brant es­tate with life­style, din­ing and liv­ing op­tions be­yond in­dus­trial fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“I hope our new fac­tory can be open 24/7, for peo­ple to plan their kitchen any time – just like those 24-hour gyms,” he says.</p>
    <p>SAMWOH COR­PO­RA­TION</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Soh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of one of Sin­ga­pore’s top con­struc­tion brands and long-time ten­ant of Sungei Kadut, says that while Samwoh has its roots as a con­struc­tion com­pany, it also recog­nises that there are other ways for busi­nesses to share re­sources, such as in the treat­ment of waste wa­ter for in­dus­trial pur­poses.</p>
    <p>“The wa­ter can be col­lected from any­where, be it from oil-and-gas, chem­i­cal or print­ing com­pa­nies. We have the tech­nol­ogy to treat the wa­ter and cir­cu­late it back into the sys­tem for other uses such as plant­ing or agri­cul­ture,” says Mr Soh, 52.</p>
    <p>He says, cur­rently, re­cy­cling is not con­sol­i­dated, with in­di­vid­ual com­pa­nies do­ing their own thing. “We need to sit down to­gether and share ef­forts in waste man­age­ment or re­cy­cling.”</p>
    <p>WAH & HUA</p>
    <p>Ms Melissa Tan, 41, gen­eral man­ager of multi-ma­te­rial re­cy­cling and waste man­age­ment com­pany Wah & Hua, hopes Sungei Kadut’s rich his­tory, which in­cludes the waste man­age­ment and tim­ber in­dus­tries, will live on.</p>
    <p>“This is one of our old­est in­dus­trial es­tates. I fully sup­port the re­vamp, but I think it should not lose its beauty and char­ac­ter. It is home to our heavy in­dus­tries, the un­sung he­roes of Sin­ga­pore,” says Ms Tan, whose com­pany has been op­er­at­ing in Sungei Kadut for about 40 years, start­ing from a sole pro­pri­etor karung guni out­fit.</p>
    <p>To­day, it boasts its own fleet of trucks and a high-tech re­cy­cling fac­tory, where waste is au­to­mat­i­cally sorted and pro­cessed. The com­pany will be mov­ing into the up­com­ing Kranji Green.</p>
    <p>“I think the re­de­vel­op­ment will at­tract the younger gen­er­a­tion with a new image and im­pres­sion,” she says.</p>
    <p>She also thinks group­ing waste man­age­ment com­pa­nies into the high-rise Kranji Green will im­prove the image of the waste man­age­ment sec­tor and help the firm re­cruit more em­ploy­ees.</p>
