    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK/DUBAI Saudi Arabia’s King Sal­man bin Ab­du­laziz Al Saud took aim at Iran dur­ing his de­but at the an­nual United Na­tions meet­ing of world lead­ers this week, call­ing for a united front to con­tain Riyadh’s ri­val and stop it from get­ting weapons of mass de­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>He said Iran ex­ploited a 2015 nu­clear deal with world pow­ers “to in­ten­sify its ex­pan­sion­ist ac­tiv­i­ties, cre­ate its ter­ror­ist net­works, and use ter­ror­ism”, adding that this had pro­duced noth­ing but “chaos, ex­trem­ism, and sec­tar­i­an­ism”.</p>
    <p>“A com­pre­hen­sive solution and a firm in­ter­na­tional po­si­tion are re­quired,” the Saudi King, 84, told the 193-mem­ber Gen­eral Assem­bly in a pre-recorded video state­ment played on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The United States, a strong ally of Saudi Arabia, quit the Iran nu­clear pact in 2018, with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump call­ing it the “worst deal ever”.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has since im­posed uni­lat­eral sanc­tions on Te­heran and as­serts that all coun­tries also should re­in­state UN sanc­tions to try to push the Is­lamic repub­lic to ne­go­ti­ate a new deal.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron told the world body on Tues­day that Wash­ing­ton’s sanc­tions campaign against Iran had failed.</p>
    <p>All re­main­ing par­ties to the nu­clear deal, in­clud­ing long-time US al­lies, and 13 of the 15 UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil mem­bers say the US claim on UN sanc­tions is void. Diplo­mats say few coun­tries are likely to reim­pose the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Our ex­pe­ri­ence with the Ira­nian regime has taught us that par­tial solutions and ap­pease­ment did not stop its threats to in­ter­na­tional peace and se­cu­rity,” King Sal­man said.</p>
    <p>Iran’s UN mis­sion spokesman Alireza Miry­ousefi re­jected what he called “the base­less al­le­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>“The un­con­struc­tive and un­war­ranted state­ment by the Saudi leader only em­bold­ens cer­tain pow­ers who are in­tent on sow­ing dis­cord among re­gional coun­tries with the aim of cre­at­ing per­ma­nent di­vi­sion and sell­ing more deadly weapons to the re­gion,” he said in an ap­par­ent swipe at the US.</p>
    <p>Sunni Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite-dom­i­nated Iran are locked in sev­eral proxy wars in the re­gion, in­clud­ing in Ye­men where a Saudi-led coali­tion has been bat­tling the Te­heran-aligned Houthi move­ment over five years.</p>
    <p>Riyadh has blamed Iran for at­tacks on the king­dom’s oil fa­cil­i­ties last year, a charge that Te­heran de­nies. Iran de­nies arm­ing groups in the Mid­dle East, i nclud­ing the Houthis, and blames re­gional ten­sions on the US and its Gulf al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump made only a pass­ing ref­er­ence to Iran dur­ing his UN ad­dress on Tues­day, fo­cus­ing in­stead on at­tack­ing China.</p>
    <p>Iran’s Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani told the Gen­eral Assem­bly on Tues­day that Wash­ing­ton could im­pose “nei­ther ne­go­ti­a­tions nor war” on his coun­try.</p>
    <p>All UN state­ments are pre­re­corded videos due to the coronaviru­s pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Gulf Arab states have also been alarmed by the ris­ing in­flu­ence of Iran’s ally Hizbol­lah in Le­banon.</p>
    <p>King Sal­man said a deadly blast in Beirut’s port last month “oc­curred as a re­sult of the hege­mony of Hizbol­lah... over the de­ci­sion-mak­ing process in Le­banon”.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have blamed the blast on a stock­pile of am­mo­nium ni­trate un­safely stored at the port.</p>
    <p>“This ter­ror­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion must be dis­armed,” the King said.</p>
    <p>On at­tempts to me­di­ate peace be­tween Is­rael and Pales­tine, the Saudi monarch said a 2002 Arab Peace Ini­tia­tive is the ba­sis for a “com­pre­hen­sive and just solution” en­sur­ing that the Pales­tini­ans ob­tain an in­de­pen­dent state with East Jerusalem as its cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“We sup­port the ef­forts of the cur­rent US ad­min­is­tra­tion to achieve peace in the Mid­dle East by bring­ing the Pales­tini­ans and the Is­raelis to the ne­go­ti­a­tion ta­ble to reach a fair and com­pre­hen­sive agree­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Saudi Arabia drew up the 2002 ini­tia­tive by which Arab na­tions of­fered to nor­malise ties with Is­rael in re­turn for a state­hood deal with the Pales­tini­ans and full Is­raeli with­drawal from ter­ri­tory cap­tured in 1967.</p>
    <p>The King stopped short of en­dors­ing re­cent US-bro­kered agree­ments by the United Arab Emi­rates and Bahrain to es­tab­lish ties with Is­rael – a strate­gic re­align­ment of Mid­dle East coun­tries against Iran. Saudi Arabia has qui­etly ac­qui­esced to the deals but has sig­nalled that it is not ready to take ac­tion it­self.</p>
    <p>Pales­tinian l ead­ers have con­demned the UAE and Bahrain’s warm­ing of re­la­tions with Is­rael, de­scrib­ing it as a be­trayal of their ef­forts to win state­hood in the oc­cu­pied West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
