    <p>Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer is rel­ish­ing Manch­ester United’s first com­pet­i­tive match against Leeds United in nine years to­day, re­call­ing “fiery” en­coun­ters dur­ing his time as a player in the Pre­mier League.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian came on as a sub­sti­tute in the last Pre­mier League meet­ing be­tween the two sides in Fe­bru­ary 2004, months be­fore Leeds tum­bled out of the English top-flight.</p>
    <p>They have met twice in Cup com­pe­ti­tions since then.</p>
    <p>Leeds, then play­ing in the third tier, pulled off a gi­ant-killing in the 2010 FA Cup, beat­ing their bit­ter ri­vals 1-0 in the third round at Old Traf­ford be­fore United avenged that with a 3-0 win in the League Cup a year later.</p>
    <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds have at­tracted rave re­views for their thrilling style un­der the Ar­gen­tinian and will travel to Manch­ester full of con­fi­dence af­ter a 5-2 win over New­cas­tle on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“I can’t wait,” said Sol­sk­jaer. “It’s been too long. I know how much it means for our sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dif­fer­ent type of Leeds com­ing up with a coach that’s re­ally done a great job with them and will test us to the limit.”</p>
    <p>The United man­ager said he had en­joyed his clashes with Leeds as a player and his two goals in a 4-3 win for Alex Fer­gu­son’s men in 2002 were a par­tic­u­lar high­light.</p>
    <p>“There were fiery games, tack­les fly­ing in, play­ers from both teams who were win­ners,” he said. “We had a few fights, of course.”</p>
    <p>Bielsa said he was aware of the na­ture of the ri­valry be­tween the two clubs and how much the match meant to the Leeds sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>“What hap­pens on the pitch can have a big im­pact on the fans,” he said. “It in­creases the re­spon­si­bil­ity and it mul­ti­plies the de­sire to im­pose your­self.”</p>
    <p>United have won just one of their six home league games this sea­son. Their woe­ful home run stands in stark con­trast to their away record, with Thurs­day’s 3-2 win at</p>
    <p>Sh­effield United their sixth straight on the road this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer sug­gested their home strug­gles could be down to the way op­po­nents set up at Old Traf­ford and he ex­pects Leeds’ ex­pan­sive style to suit United.</p>
    <p>“It’s just down to fine mar­gins – who gets the first goal and how the op­po­si­tion set up,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think we’ll play a team who make it a hard game and also it will be an open game be­cause the games I’ve seen from Leeds have been very en­ter­tain­ing.”</p>
    <p>United striker Edin­son Ca­vani re­mains a doubt for the game due to a groin in­jury, while Bielsa has con­firmed that Leeds have no fresh in­jury con­cerns. MAN UNITED V LEEDS</p>
