    <p>The United States is in a risky phase, with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in­sist­ing that he has been cheated of an elec­tion win.</p>
    <p>In the short term, the trans­fer of power from Mr Trump to Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is look­ing far from smooth. The vote count shows clearly that Mr Bi­den won the elec­tion, and, on Tues­day, he called Mr Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede an “em­bar­rass­ment”.</p>
    <p>The ran­cour is deep, and likely to colour the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, which will also face acute leg­isla­tive gridlock as Repub­li­cans look set to re­main with a slim ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>As of Tues­day night in Washington, Democrats seemed headed to con­trol 48 seats in the next Se­nate, to the Repub­li­cans’ 50. A run-off poll for two seats is in the off­ing.</p>
    <p>Pro-Trump groups are plan­ning to rally for the Pres­i­dent in Washington on Satur­day, as he makes what some pun­dits have char­ac­terised as a “last stand”.</p>
    <p>One of the ral­lies is called the Mil­lion Maga March, ac­cord­ing to the group on Twit­ter. An­other is themed Stop the Steal.</p>
    <p>This is rais­ing wor­ries about clashes with anti-Trump pro­test­ers around the heav­ily bar­ri­caded White House.</p>
    <p>A bat­tery of law­suits launched in var­i­ous states by the Repub­li­can Party, over al­leged elec­tion ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties, has thus far not seen court de­ci­sions con­firm­ing any.</p>
    <p>Even if some are un­earthed, ex­perts say that will not change the arith­metic of the out­come, which is clearly in Mr Bi­den’s favour.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said the ad­min­is­tra­tion was ready for a tran­si­tion – to a sec­ond Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In the same breath, Mr Pom­peo said the world should have “ev­ery con­fi­dence” that the tran­si­tion to “the pres­i­dent who’s in of­fice on Jan 20, a minute af­ter noon, will… be suc­cess­ful”.</p>
    <p>Thus, the first part may have been a joke. But few were amused. The re­mark came even as Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den spoke with lead­ers of France, Ger­many, Ire­land and Bri­tain. The dis­so­nance led diplo­mats and an­a­lysts to use words like “sur­real” and “bizarre”.</p>
    <p>Se­nate ma­jor­ity leader Mitch McCon­nell told jour­nal­ists there was no cause for alarm.</p>
    <p>“Un­til the Elec­toral Col­lege votes, any­one who is run­ning for of­fice can ex­haust con­cerns in count­ing in any court of ap­pro­pri­ate ju­ris­dic­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“At some point here, we’ll find out, fi­nally, who was cer­ti­fied in each of th­ese states and the Elec­toral Col­lege will de­ter­mine the winner.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the rules, the dead­line for re­solv­ing all elec­tion dis­putes is Dec 8. On Dec 14, the elec­tors meet in their states and cast their bal­lots for pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent. Th­ese must be re­ceived by the Se­nate, and, on Jan 6, be counted at a joint ses­sion of Congress.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the chal­lenge to the elec­tion re­sult is less about num­bers and more about po­lit­i­cal theatre – to rile up Mr Trump’s base. His per­sona is that of a fighter against all odds. Los­ing does not ap­pear to be in his lex­i­con. Sow­ing doubt about the in­tegrity of the elec­tion dele­git­imises Mr Bi­den’s win and en­ables Mr Trump to al­ways claim he was the right­ful winner.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, re­fus­ing to con­cede ups the ante and may be a ne­go­ti­at­ing tac­tic, an­a­lysts say, to se­cure pro­tec­tion from pros­e­cu­tion for him­self and his fam­ily once he leaves of­fice.</p>
    <p>“Trump can’t ex­tract con­ces­sions like im­mu­nity from pros­e­cu­tion for him­self and his as­so­ciates, if his threat to re­main in power is not cred­i­ble,” tweeted Dr Vasab­jit Ban­er­jee, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor in the Depart­ment of Po­lit­i­cal Sci­ence and Public Ad­min­is­tra­tion at Mississipp­i</p>
    <p>State Uni­ver­sity. “He has to send... sig­nals to show he in­tends to re­main in power. This sig­nalling has be­gun.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent is suc­ceed­ing. A Reuters/Ip­sos poll re­leased on Tues­day shows most Amer­i­cans think Mr Bi­den won the elec­tion fair and square. But most Repub­li­cans do not.</p>
    <p>Also on Tues­day, Mr Trump raised eye­brows by re­plac­ing two top Depart­ment of De­fence of­fi­cials with loy­al­ists. This came a day af­ter De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper was fired – which had been ex­pected, given his ap­par­ent dis­agree­ments with the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>This has trig­gered spec­u­la­tion on the role of the mil­i­tary in a cri­sis po­ten­tially in­volv­ing civil un­rest. One po­ten­tial prob­lem is that even though at some point the</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent may stop in­sti­gat­ing his base, it might not have the in­tended ef­fect.</p>
    <p>There is worry, Dr Ban­er­jee told The Straits Times, that “the mil­i­tary will be put in a po­si­tion where if it does not do any­thing, it will fa­cil­i­tate an au­thor­i­tar­ian power grab, and if it does any­thing, it will have a par­ti­san out­come in favour of the Democrats, in which case, the mil­i­tary would be act­ing as an ar­biter. So it’s lose-lose. The mil­i­tary doesn’t want that”.</p>
