    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic will cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore and Sri Lanka to deepen trade ties, with agri-busi­ness and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion sin­gled out for par­tic­u­lar fo­cus dur­ing a we­bi­nar on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the we­bi­nar, Sin­ga­pore’s High Com­mis­sioner to Sri Lanka, Mr S. Chan­dra Das, spoke of new op­por­tu­ni­ties de­spite the fact that Covid-19 has been “a very tir­ing pe­riod both (for) diplo­matic and busi­ness co­op­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>“New ideas will con­tinue to mul­ti­ply as we move to re­open our economies and so­ci­eties. Covid-19 (will) spur us to re-imag­ine the pos­si­bil­i­ties and grab hold of new op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan­dra Das added: “Sin­ga­pore and Sri Lanka have a long­stand­ing trade re­la­tion­ship, par­tic­u­larly (in) the area of food.”</p>
    <p>“Our im­port of Sri Lankan pro­duce has grown, both in quan­tity and va­ri­ety, from cayenne spices to crabs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sri Lankan High Com­mis­sioner to Sin­ga­pore Sashikala Pre­maward­hane said food se­cu­rity was among the ar­eas in which the two coun­tries could deepen co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’ve done very well on the in­vest­ment side between 2015 and 2019,” she said, point­ing out that Sin­ga­pore was Sri Lanka’s fifth­largest in­vestor. About 100 Sin­ga­porean busi­nesses were op­er­at­ing in Sri Lanka, she added.</p>
    <p>“We see huge op­por­tu­ni­ties for the two coun­tries to... aug­ment ties, par­tic­u­larly in the eco­nomic, trade and in­vest­ment fields,” she said.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has high­lighted the im­por­tance for coun­tries to keep in touch at a time when borders re­main closed and sup­ply chains have been dis­rupted, to en­sure that food se­cu­rity is­sues do not hin­der eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties, she said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore pro­duces less than 10 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar on busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties, par­tic­u­larly in ar­eas such as dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and agri-busi­ness, was held on the 50th an­niver­sary of the es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic ties between Sin­ga­pore and Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan­dra Das said: “The friendly re­la­tions between our two coun­tries en­joyed to­day are founded on his­tor­i­cal events, even fa­mil­ial ties, estab­lished long be­fore our in­de­pen­dence.”</p>
    <p>A state­ment from the Sri Lanka High Com­mis­sion in Sin­ga­pore noted that ties between the two coun­tries go back to at least the 1800s, given that both share the same an­cient mar­itime trade routes.</p>
    <p>Top­ics covered dur­ing the we­bi­nar in­cluded dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of busi­nesses, food sup­ply re­silience in Sin­ga­pore and food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>To­tal bi­lat­eral trade last year was val­ued at US$883 mil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion), with Sri Lankan ex­ports val­ued at US$115 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Sri Lanka High Com­mis­sion.</p>
