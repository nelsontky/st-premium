    <p>GENEVA • After years of US dis­en­gage­ment and con­fronta­tion, in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions in Geneva ap­peared to heave a col­lec­tive sigh of re­lief at Mr Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory in the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion – but the an­tic­i­pated hon­ey­moon could be short.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery­one is ba­si­cally wait­ing with open arms for the US gov­ern­ment to come back,” said in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions pro­fes­sor Man­fred El­sig from the World Trade In­sti­tute of Bern Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has been a trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ence for in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions that in many cases were cre­ated by the United States and ac­cus­tomed to strong US sup­port and lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>In Geneva alone, the US has, un­der Mr Trump, cut its ties to the UN’s top rights body, ham­strung the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) and be­gun with­draw­ing from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) even as the body strives to co­or­di­nate the global re­sponse to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>After the elec­tion was called for Demo­cratic chal­lenger Bi­den last week­end, “there was a huge sigh of re­lief” within in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions, said a Geneva trade of­fi­cial who asked not to be named.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers ex­pect Wash­ing­ton un­der Mr Bi­den to re-en­gage with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, and to re­sume dis­cus­sions on some is­sues blocked by his pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>“I think there will be a bit of a hon­ey­moon,” Pro­fes­sor El­sig said, warn­ing though that the bliss­ful pe­riod could be “short”.</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tive – pushed hard for four years – that in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions are tak­ing ad­van­tage of the US re­mains deeply in­grained, es­pe­cially among Repub­li­cans, he said.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery step that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will take to­wards en­gag­ing with the world and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions will be crit­i­cally mon­i­tored in the US.”</p>
    <p>While stum­bling blocks re­main, there is op­ti­mism that dis­cus­sions within in­ter­na­tional fo­rums will be­come more con­struc­tive.</p>
    <p>The WHO has par­tic­u­lar rea­son to cel­e­brate, after suf­fer­ing re­lent­less US at­tacks in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Ac­cus­ing the United Na­tions health agency of mis­han­dling the Covid-19 re­sponse and of kow­tow­ing to China, Mr Trump has be­gun with­draw­ing the US – tra­di­tion­ally the WHO’s top donor – from the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den has said in a tweet: “On my first day as pres­i­dent, I will re­join the WHO and re­store our lead­er­ship on the world stage.”</p>
    <p>WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus struck an up­beat tone in his con­grat­u­la­tory tweet to Mr Bi­den, say­ing: “I look for­ward to work­ing with you and your teams. Crises like the Covid-19 pandemic show the im­por­tance of global sol­i­dar­ity in pro­tect­ing lives and liveli­hoods.”</p>
    <p>The WTO will cer­tainly also wel­come a change of guard in the US.</p>
    <p>The global trade body is fac­ing mul­ti­ple crises, with the US block­ing its bud­get, crip­pling its dis­pute set­tle­ment sys­tem and im­ped­ing the se­lec­tion of its new leader.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond Geneva trade of­fi­cial said Mr Bi­den could con­ceiv­ably re­verse course and give ap­proval to Nige­ria’s Ms Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala be­com­ing the first woman and first African to lead the WTO.</p>
    <p>There will not be the same “gra­tu­itous ag­gres­sive­ness”, he said.</p>
    <p>While in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions can now per­haps look for­ward to more con­struc­tive en­gage­ment with Wash­ing­ton, Prof El­sig stressed that not all of Mr Trump’s at­tacks had been blus­ter.</p>
    <p>“Maybe 10 per cent of the crit­i­cism is to be taken se­ri­ously,” he said, point­ing to grow­ing agree­ment that re­forms at the WHO and other in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions were needed.</p>
    <p>In the short term, he said, Mr Bi­den should en­joy good­will among in­ter­na­tional part­ners and will be “in a strong po­si­tion” to push le­git­i­mate de­mands for change.</p>
