    <p>RAIS­ING DE­LIV­ERY CA­PAC­ITY</p>
    <p>There are plans to go north to the Sengkang, Pung­gol area, and to the west. So th­ese are three clus­ters we have iden­ti­fied in the last few months where we want to have cloud kitchens.</p>
    <p>MR ERNEST TING, owner of Swee Choon Tim Sum Restau­rant, on plans to open two more cloud kitchens, which are cen­tralised kitchens for de­liv­ery ser­vices.</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore en­tered the cir­cuit breaker in April, Swee Choon Tim Sum Restau­rant, which of­ten had snaking queues out­side its Jalan Be­sar out­let pre-pan­demic, saw its sales plum­met by around 30 per cent and prof­its by about 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>To min­imise losses from dine-in sales, it turned to on­line sales us­ing food de­liv­ery ser­vices, Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day dur­ing a visit to the home-grown restau­rant.</p>
    <p>The eatery also stepped up its dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing and tapped ad­di­tional food de­liv­ery plat­forms to reach more cus­tomers, with sup­port from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s Food De­liv­ery Booster Pack­age to sub­sidise de­liv­ery costs, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>The pack­age, in­tro­duced in April, cov­ered part of the com­mis­sion charged by de­liv­ery firms Food­panda, De­liv­eroo and GrabFood.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said th­ese ef­forts helped to sig­nif­i­cantly in­crease Swee Choon’s sales from food</p>
    <p>de­liv­er­ies dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, from less than 1 per cent to around 60 per cent of its av­er­age monthly rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“While dine-in has re­sumed, food de­liv­ery sales con­tinue to con­trib­ute about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of their monthly rev­enue,” he added.</p>
    <p>Adopt­ing dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies has also helped Swee Choon un­der</p>
    <p>stand where its cus­tomers or­der from, so that it can make bet­ter de­ci­sions about open­ing fu­ture out­lets, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Mr Ernest Ting, the third-gen­er­a­tion owner of the 58-year-old Swee Choon, said the plan is to open two more cloud kitchens, in ad­di­tion to the first one which opened in Tampines last week.</p>
    <p>“There are plans to go north to</p>
    <p>the Sengkang, Pung­gol area, and to the west. So th­ese are three clus­ters we have iden­ti­fied in the last few months where we want to have cloud kitchens,” he added.</p>
    <p>Cloud kitchens are cen­tralised kitchens where two or more restau­rants are lo­cated in the same space for de­liv­ery ser­vices.</p>
