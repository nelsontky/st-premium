    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>It is a good day for art, mu­sic and cul­ture, even if you have busi­ness to at­tend to. If you can mix them up, so much the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You need to reach a de­ci­sion or­gan­i­cally. If some­one is breath­ing down your neck, re­mind him or her to let you do things your way.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your peo­ple are mak­ing their move, so en­sure that you help as much as pos­si­ble. You could be part of some­thing re­ally big.</p>
    <p>Cancer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>When the sit­u­a­tion gets tense, keep a cool head. Things are sure to get back to nor­mal if you can chill out a lit­tle and let oth­ers snipe.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your opin­ions are not set in stone and you show how flex­i­ble your think­ing can be. It should come across as a big win.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You feel a surge of en­ergy that is bring­ing on a new sense of pur­pose, so make the most of it. Things are look­ing good.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22) Re­la­tion­ships are in fo­cus, so spend time with your sweetie or make a date with the of­fice hot­tie.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your health may be both­er­ing you, so get a check-up. Pay at­ten­tion to the lit­tle things if you want to feel bet­ter years from now.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21) A child-like won­der fills you, so for­get ev­ery­thing learnt and make up the rules as you go along. Your mood should lift those around you.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Check your fire plan, emer­gency sup­plies or what­ever else you need to take care of to keep your body and soul se­cure and safe.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You dis­cover some­thing big, but it is also time for you to fig­ure out how to re­lay this in­for­ma­tion back to those who can make the most of it.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20) Some­thing is not quite right, but you can tell it is go­ing to be okay in the long run. How­ever, you have al­most zero chance of con­vinc­ing oth­ers.</p>
