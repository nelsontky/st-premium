    <p>As the race for the White House inched to­wards what ap­pears to be a nail-bit­ing con­clu­sion, the drama was also riv­et­ing for non-Amer­i­cans in Asia.</p>
    <p>Crowds packed pubs and cafes for watch par­ties across the con­ti­nent, but of­fi­cials in Asian cap­i­tals kept mostly mum as the out­come of the pres­i­den­tial race re­mained un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>In China, where cov­er­age of the US election has been muted, the For­eign Min­istry re­fused to be drawn into com­ment­ing on it.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin was asked twice about the poll at a daily press briefing yes­ter­day , in­clud­ing if Bei­jing had a pre­ferred win­ner.</p>
    <p>He stuck firmly to the of­fi­cial line in his re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“The US election is an in­ter­nal af­fair of the US, and China does not hold a po­si­tion on this,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing also ap­peared to be at­tempt­ing to tamp down dis­cus­sions on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The “US Election” hash­tag on mi­cro-blog­ging site Weibo was listed as the 11th most dis­cussed topic de­spite hav­ing over 4.72 bil­lion views (as at 7pm yes­ter­day), more than any of the other trend­ing topics listed by the plat­form.</p>
    <p>It ranked be­low posts on Wash­ing­ton’s exit from the Paris cli­mate agree­ment, which ranked sec­ond. Wash­ing­ton of­fi­cially ex­ited the global cli­mate deal yes­ter­day, a year after Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said the coun­try would do so.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese gov­ern­ment cen­sors hold con­sid­er­able in­flu­ence over dis­cus­sions on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia plat­forms, and can pro­mote or di­min­ish the promi­nence of cer­tain topics.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy said Bei­jing was very sen­si­tive to dis­cus­sions per­tain­ing to democ­racy and elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“There is se­ri­ous con­cern that dis­cus­sion about elec­tions could lead Chi­nese to ask why there aren’t elec­tions in China,” he said.</p>
    <p>In Tokyo, politi­cians said they were mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion closely, and pledged to work with who­ever ended up at the White House. “The US-Ja­pan al­liance is the cor­ner­stone of Ja­panese diplo­macy, and I will firmly work with who­ever is the next US pres­i­dent,” Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said at a Diet ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Seoul took a sim­i­lar line, with South Korean me­dia also point­ing out that the out­come would af­fect ne­go­ti­a­tions with North Korea as well as dis­cus­sions about de­fence cost shar­ing and trade ties..</p>
    <p>In In­dia, TV chan­nels pro­vided real-time up­dates of re­sults in the US with run­ning com­men­tary from Indian as well as US ex­perts.</p>
    <p>One big rea­son for the keen in­ter­est is the close rap­port shared be­tween Pres­i­dent Trump and Indian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s early dec­la­ra­tion of vic­tory, de­spite the fact that votes were still be­ing counted, sparked in­tro­spec­tion about the state of pol­i­tics in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Jakarta-based data an­a­lyt­ics and strat­egy con­sul­tant Shafiq Pon­toh said it re­minded In­done­sians of the coun­try’s deeply di­vi­sive pres­i­den­tial election last year, when the chal­lenger Prabowo Su­bianto de­clared vic­tory while count­ing was still in progress. Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo even­tu­ally was re-elected and he later ap­pointed his ri­val as de­fence min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Many in the Philip­pines ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment on­line that the White House race had come down to the wire. Free­lance writer Geral­dine Ro­driquez said that it could be a har­bin­ger of what could hap­pen in elec­tions in the Philip­pines in 2022. “Is Amer­ica’s election an indicator of what would hap­pen in the Philip­pines in 2022? I hope not,” she said.</p>
