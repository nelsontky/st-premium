    <p>Work­ers have been shielded from the worst eco­nomic ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic due to sub­stan­tial fi­nan­cial sup­port from the Gov­ern­ment, but there will likely be re­trench­ments and more dif­fi­cult days, said l abour chief Ng Chee Meng.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) re­mains pre­pared to sup­port work­ers amid th­ese chal­leng­ing times by pro­tect­ing every worker, pre­serv­ing jobs for all and pro­vid­ing care and sup­port for those in need, he said in his Na­tional Day mes­sage yes­ter­day .</p>
    <p>“This year has been a year like no other. We are amidst great change and up­heaval. The Covid-19 pan­demic has dis­rupted Sin­ga­pore and many coun­tries eco­nom­i­cally and so­cially. The health risks are still at our doorstep,” said Mr Ng, who is NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral.</p>
    <p>“Although the Gov­ern­ment’s sub­stan­tial fi­nan­cial aid has shielded us from the very worst eco­nomic ef­fects at the on­set of the pan­demic, we must be pre­pared for re­trench­ments, cut­backs and more dif­fi­cult days ahead.”</p>
    <p>He also thanked front-line work­ers, who have stepped up to pro­tect com­mu­ni­ties and keep Sin­ga­pore go­ing, for their self­less ded­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said NTUC is work­ing with com­pa­nies to pre­serve jobs by first ex­plor­ing all cost-cut­ting op­tions.</p>
    <p>“I trust that both unions and em­ploy­ers will ap­proach th­ese ex­er­cises with trans­parency and in mu­tual good faith,” he said.</p>
    <p>He urged em­ploy­ers to con­sider sec­ond­ing work­ers to sec­tors which are still hir­ing, so as to pre­serve their own man­power ca­pa­bil­i­ties while keep­ing work­ers em­ployed.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers in in­dus­tries that can still train work­ers can tap the en­hanced Union Train­ing As­sis­tance Pro­gramme and the NETF (NTUCE­d­u­ca­tion and Train­ing Fund) Col­lab­o­ra­tive Fund, he added.</p>
    <p>Where re­trench­ment is un­avoid­able, the top pri­or­ity is to en­sure that com­pa­nies treat work­ers fairly and with dig­nity, ac­cord­ing to the Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work which NTUC pro­posed last month, said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the frame­work in­cludes pro­tect­ing the Sin­ga­porean core of the work­force, while for­eign­ers with spe­cial or crit­i­cal skills could be re­tained as well.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said that unions, to­gether with NTUC’s Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and the Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute, will do their best to match af­fected work­ers to jobs and en­sure that they re­ceive train­ing as needed for them to take on new jobs.</p>
    <p>He had high­lighted an un­fair re­trench­ment ex­er­cise in a Face­book post last week, say­ing that three unions were given the green light to go on strike, if nec­es­sary, to pre­vent air­craft main­te­nance firm Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia from go­ing ahead with planned re­trench­ments of more than 140 work­ers uni­lat­er­ally.</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial ac­tion was averted in the end af­ter the em­ployer cor­rected its re­trench­ment process and reached an am­i­ca­ble agree­ment with the unions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng also said in his mes­sage yes­ter­day that NTUC is mo­bil­is­ing its net­work to sup­port the Gov­ern­ment in cre­at­ing new jobs and trainee­ships for young and old Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>NTUC will press on with dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and in­no­va­tions in its union, mem­ber­ship and train­ing mod­els so that it can rep­re­sent work­ers well and be rel­e­vant to them, he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that this comes as Covid-19 has mag­ni­fied global uncer­tain­ties and ac­cel­er­ated the shift to­wards new ways of work­ing and do­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng called on em­ploy­ers and the Gov­ern­ment to con­tinue work­ing with the labour move­ment “in the spirit of shared re­spon­si­bil­ity and com­mon un­der­stand­ing, to en­sure that we pull through this cri­sis to­gether”.</p>
    <p>Wish­ing work­ers a happy Na­tional Day, he con­cluded: “Now, more than ever, Sin­ga­pore­ans must unite. NTUC prom­ises to work to­gether with you to emerge stronger and build a Sin­ga­pore that we can be proud to call home.”</p>
