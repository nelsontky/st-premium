    <p>New na­tional men’s bas­ket­ball coach Neo Nam Kheng may have been ap­pointed in un­cer­tain times, but his plan is clear – iden­tify a pool of com­mit­ted cagers, im­prove their fit­ness and shoot­ing per­cent­age, and in­tro­duce qual­ity spar­ring op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Since the men’s team won their first SEA Games medal in 34 years by fin­ish­ing third at the 2013 SEA Games, they have been un­able to break through the ceil­ing. They re­tained bronze at home in 2015, be­fore los­ing the bronze-medal play­off in 2017. They failed to reach the semi-fi­nals last year.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times in March, when Neo re­placed Hsu Tung-ching af­ter his con­tract ended, Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (BAS) pres­i­dent Hoo Boon Hock set Neo the tar­get of a medal at next year’s SEA Games.</p>
    <p>Neo is con­fi­dent his team can de­liver de­spite fac­ing nu­mer­ous chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old, whose term runs un­til the end of next year’s Hanoi Games, was as­sis­tant coach to Neo Beng Siang in 2015 and Frank Arsego in 2017.</p>
    <p>He saw Sin­ga­pore trail Thai­land by just three points af­ter three quar­ters in the 2017 bronze-medal play­off in Kuala Lumpur, be­fore get­ting over­pow­ered in the fi­nal pe­riod to lose 65-55.</p>
    <p>Neo said: “There is not much re­cov­ery time be­tween games in in­ter­na­tional tour­na­ments, we may play once ev­ery two days, or even ev­ery day so fit­ness is very im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“With many teams hav­ing nat­u­ralised play­ers, we are not the big­gest team, so we need to be bet­ter in other ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>This in­cludes field-goal shoot­ing per­cent­age, which was be­low 40 per cent at last year’s SEA Games in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>While Neo knows he can count on 31-year-old guard Wong Wei Long and 23-year-old swing­man Leon Kwek to shoot well, he chal­lenged his side to be more con­sis­tent and to av­er­age 45 per cent in shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Top of Neo’s wish list is to en­gage a short-term shoot­ing coach for his play­ers as well as a strength and con­di­tion­ing spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>He also wants to take his team for more fre­quent over­seas train­ing camps where they can build un­der­stand­ing and play against strong op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the na­tional team would prac­tise against the ex­pat com­mu­nity if they are un­able to travel.</p>
    <p>The de­fence-ori­ented coach said:</p>
    <p>“We def­i­nitely need to play against qual­ity op­po­si­tion to get used to the high-in­ten­sity games at in­ter­na­tional level.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise we can­not do all these on our own, and we will work closely with Sport Sin­ga­pore to get their strong sup­port to re­alise our aim of get­ting to the next level.”</p>
    <p>He is also look­ing to build for the fu­ture even though he has up-and­com­ing play­ers like 23-year-old guards Kelvin Lim and Lim Jun Yuan at his dis­posal.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, his wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence from over three decades in the lo­cal bas­ket­ball fra­ter­nity was a key rea­son why he emerged top of a three­man short­list for the job.</p>
    <p>The former point guard – part of the na­tional team who fin­ished a re­spectable 10th out of 18 teams at the 1991 Asian Bas­ket­ball Cham­pi­onship – coached schools and led the na­tional Un­der-16 and Un­der-18 boys’ teams be­fore his stint as na­tional as­sis­tant coach.</p>
    <p>BAS coach­ing and de­vel­op­ment chair­man Allen Lee said: “He has a good un­der­stand­ing of the lo­cal ecosys­tem and pro­vides con­ti­nu­ity from hav­ing been an as­sis­tant coach at re­cent SEA Games.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic forc­ing sport into a stand­still for months, Neo has not been idle.</p>
    <p>Scout­ing the Sin­ga­pore Slingers, Na­tional Bas­ket­ball League (NBL), NBL qual­i­fy­ing rounds and In­sti­tute-Var­sity-Polytech­nic scene, he has a long list of 44 play­ers for the na­tional se­lec­tion squad.</p>
    <p>“We want to have a sus­tain­able train­ing plan,” said Neo, who pointed out that na­tional team train­ing ses­sions some­times do not have the num­bers be­cause of work, study or na­tional ser­vice com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>“The team will be cut to 12 when we go for com­pe­ti­tions, but there will be op­por­tu­ni­ties for many be­cause of the var­i­ous com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>“We need con­stant re­newal and fresh batches of talent com­ing in to chal­lenge them. We be­lieve there are tal­ents out there in a vi­brant lo­cal bas­ket­ball scene and we will look for them.”</p>
    <p>BET­TER SCRIM­MAGES</p>
    <p>We def­i­nitely need to play against qual­ity op­po­si­tion to get used to the high-in­ten­sity games at in­ter­na­tional level. ’’</p>
    <p>NEO NAM KHENG, Sin­ga­pore’s bas­ket­ball coach, on the need for qual­ity spar­ring op­po­nents.</p>
