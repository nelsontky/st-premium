    <p>From Au­gust next year, un­der­grad­u­ates en­ter­ing Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) will have to take up a com­mon core cur­ricu­lum that will en­able them to make con­nec­tions across dis­ci­plines and de­velop in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary knowl­edge and skills.</p>
    <p>The core cur­ricu­lum cour­ses will take up one-fifth of their aca­demic work­load, and are aimed at de­vel­op­ing a range of abil­i­ties, in­clud­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills, dig­i­tal lit­er­acy, and en­ter­prise and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pul­sory cour­ses are de­signed around so­ci­ety’s great­est chal­lenges and is­sues such as cli­mate change and global health.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Subra Suresh, who is NTU pres­i­dent, said the univer­sity has al­ways em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of a holis­tic and broad ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the dou­ble de­grees and dou­ble ma­jor de­grees, there is also the Gen­eral Ed­u­ca­tional Re­quire­ment cour­ses, where stu­dents se­lect from a bas­ket of elec­tive cour­ses in­clud­ing those fo­cused on sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy and so­ci­ety. The new core cur­ricu­lum will re­place these gen­eral ed­u­ca­tion cour­ses.</p>
    <p>He said NTU now wants to go fur­ther through the com­mon core cur­ricu­lum, to en­able stu­dents to in­te­grate knowl­edge from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines. He stressed that the chal­lenges the world is now deal­ing with, and will in­creas­ingly be fac­ing, are in­ter-re­lated and can no longer be suc­cess­fully tack­led by sin­gle-do­main ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>“Ad­dress­ing these chal­lenges will re­quire an un­der­stand­ing of the big­ger pic­ture and of the man­ner in which peo­ple of dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines need to be able to work to­gether,” he said. “Those who can thrive in this chang­ing global en­vi­ron­ment will have a broad in­ter­est and knowl­edge out­side of their spe­cific dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, they should be able to ap­pre­ci­ate the eth­i­cal di­men­sions of writ­ing code that col­lects peo­ple’s per­sonal data with­out their knowl­edge, or the im­por­tance of in­tu­itive and aes­thetic de­sign in the engi­neer­ing of a new health­care de­vice.”</p>
    <p>To de­velop their abil­i­ties to work in mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary teams, stu­dents from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines will learn to­gether in the same class­room. They will be ex­pected to ap­ply the knowl­edge from their re­spec­tive dis­ci­plines to col­lab­o­rate on group projects.</p>
    <p>Fac­ulty from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines will come to­gether to de­sign and teach the cour­ses. For ex­am­ple, a course on sus­tain­abil­ity may draw on fac­ulty from dis­ci­plines as var­ied as cli­mate sci­ence, en­vi­ron­men­tal engi­neer­ing, busi­ness and en­vi­ron­men­tal his­tory.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ling San, NTU’s deputy pres­i­dent and provost, said the con­nec­tion be­tween em­ploy­a­bil­ity and in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary skills is set to be­come more prom­i­nent in the af­ter­math of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He added: “Grad­u­ates with trans­fer­able skills that are portable across any in­dus­try or job will be able to tran­sit through dif­fer­ent jobs and ca­reers in a rapidly chang­ing and dis­rup­tive work l and­scape.”</p>
    <p>He said the core cur­ricu­lum will be pi­loted in a few schools this year, be­fore be­ing adopted uni­ver­si­ty­wide in Au­gust next year.</p>
    <p>It will ap­ply to all un­der­grad­u­ates ex­cept those read­ing for a med­i­cal de­gree, which has a dif­fer­ent ed­u­ca­tional and pro­fes­sional frame­work.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity said the new core cur­ricu­lum is in line with the NTU smart cam­pus vi­sion, which seeks to pre­pare stu­dents for a new world that is be­ing shaped by ad­vanced dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Prof Suresh, who launched the plan in early 2018 when he took over as pres­i­dent, said then that the vi­sion seeks to nur­ture and trans­form the NTU cam­pus as a place for the dis­cov­ery, de­vel­op­ment and de­ploy­ment, as well as a liv­ing test bed, for tech­nolo­gies that en­hance the hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence and ben­e­fit so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In keep­ing with that vi­sion, the univer­sity had in re­cent years made ma­jor re­vi­sions to its un­der­grad­u­ate of­fer­ings. It also set up the NTU In­sti­tute of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy for Hu­man­ity, an in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary cen­tre that seeks to make sense of how tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances im­pact so­ci­eties, cul­tures and hu­man be­hav­iour.</p>
