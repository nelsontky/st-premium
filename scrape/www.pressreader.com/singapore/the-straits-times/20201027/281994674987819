    <p>A 48-year-old cy­clist died in hospi­tal af­ter an ac­ci­dent with a truck at the junc­tion of New Up­per Changi Road and Be­dok North Road yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice told cit­i­zen jour­nal­ism web­site Stomp that they were alerted to the hit-and-run ac­ci­dent at 11.42am.</p>
    <p>The male cy­clist was taken to Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal, where he later died. A 67-year-old man was sub­se­quently ar­rested in re­la­tion to the case.</p>
    <p>A Stomp con­trib­u­tor, who wanted to be known only as Joe, said he was on a bus at around 12.05pm when he passed by the ac­ci­dent scene and saw a man ly­ing on the road.</p>
    <p>“The man did not seem like he was mov­ing,” said Joe. A photo taken by Joe shows paramedics at­tend­ing to the vic­tim. A red patch of what ap­pears to be blood can also be seen on the road.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the case.</p>
