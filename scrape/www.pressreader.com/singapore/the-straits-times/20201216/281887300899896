    <p>Five years ago at an air­field on the out­skirts of Paris, nearly 200 na­tions agreed on a deal they hoped would save hu­man­ity and the planet. Faced with a grow­ing cri­sis, they put aside years of anger and mis­trust to back an ac­tion plan, one that re­quired a to­tal global eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>That level of diplo­macy and co­op­er­a­tion, led by China, the United States and the Euro­pean Union, seems in­con­ceiv­able to­day. Yet the spirit that led to the cre­ation of the 2015 Paris cli­mate agree­ment and the drive for it to suc­ceed is very much alive and grow­ing.</p>
    <p>“Paris was a turn­ing point. It re­ally was a ma­jor step for the world,” said Pro­fes­sor Nick Stern, a Bri­tish econ­o­mist and chair of the Gran­tham Re­search In­sti­tute on Cli­mate Change and the En­vi­ron­ment at the Lon­don</p>
    <p>School of Eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>It was a new recog­ni­tion of where the world was go­ing, he said dur­ing a re­cent press call to re­lease a re­port re­view­ing the ef­fect of the Paris Agree­ment on economies.</p>
    <p>Five years on, the agree­ment has helped usher in rapid tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion in re­new­able en­ergy, bat­tery stor­age and elec­tri­fi­ca­tion of trans­port. Since 2015, it has been clear that rapid tech­no­log­i­cal change can hap­pen fast, in­deed, far faster than many be­lieved pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Yet for all this, progress has been un­even. The agree­ment has not yet achieved the one thing that could save us from dan­ger­ous cli­mate change: all ma­jor pol­luters com­mit­ting to much deeper emis­sions cuts this decade. It is on this that the agree­ment could well be judged a suc­cess or fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Un­der the agree­ment, na­tions must lodge this year new and up­dated pledges to cut emis­sions by 2030. The United Na­tions said these new pledges are still in­suf­fi­cient and col­lec­tively will lead the world to warm­ing well be­yond 2 deg C by the end of the cen­tury.</p>
    <p>The UN In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Panel on Cli­mate Change said global car­bon diox­ide (CO2) emis­sions, mainly from burn­ing fos­sil fu­els, need to be cut by 45 per cent by 2030 to try to limit global warm­ing to 1.5 deg C. Yet global CO2 emis­sions reached an­other record last year.</p>
    <p>The UN En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme said emis­sions need to be re­duced 7.6 per cent a year from this year un­til 2030 to keep warm­ing to 1.5 deg C. At the na­tional level, this means coun­tries would have to step up emis­sions re­duc­tion three- to five-fold from cur­rent lev­els. The world has shown am­bi­tion on green en­ergy but not, col­lec­tively, deep emis­sions cuts.</p>
    <p>What’s needed is far greater in­vest­ment in re­new­able en­ergy, elec­tri­fi­ca­tion of trans­port, greener build­ings and far more ef­fi­cient agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>The good news is that change is hap­pen­ing but not, yet, fast enough.</p>
    <p>THE ROAD MAP</p>
    <p>“We are walk­ing in one di­rec­tion that is ir­refutable and that is de­car­bon­i­sa­tion of the global econ­omy,” Ms Chris­tiana Figueres, a ma­jor fig­ure in the cre­ation of the Paris Agree­ment, told a re­cent me­dia brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“Are we do­ing it fast enough? No. Are we shav­ing off the very dan­ger­ous in­creases in tem­per­a­tures that we saw be­fore 2015? Yes,” added the ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary of the United Na­tions Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change from 2010 un­til 2016.</p>
    <p>The Paris Agree­ment sets tem­per­a­ture lim­its and clear time­lines for the emis­sions cuts needed.</p>
    <p>Sig­na­to­ries agreed to keep global warm­ing to well be­low 2 deg C and, ideally, aim for 1.5 deg C, be­yond which cli­mate change im­pacts rapidly in­crease. We’re al­ready at</p>
    <p>1.1 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial lev­els.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment also sets out a longer-term vi­sion of net zero emis­sions by 2050 to sta­bilise the cli­mate – that is, economies will re­move the same amount of car­bon that they re­lease.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, a grow­ing num­ber of gov­ern­ments and busi­nesses have pledged long-term emis­sions re­duc­tion tar­gets to cap global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>About half the global econ­omy is now cov­ered by com­mit­ments for car­bon emis­sions to reach net zero by mid-cen­tury. China re­cently pledged to be car­bon neu­tral by 2060, no easy feat for the world’s top green­house gas pol­luter and coal con­sumer. If the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion in the US for­malises its 2050 net zero pledge, more than 60 per cent of the global econ­omy will be cov­ered.</p>
    <p>A grow­ing num­ber of banks, in­sur­ers, in­vest­ment funds and large com­pa­nies have also made emis­sions re­duc­tion pledges and is­sued ex­clu­sion poli­cies for car­bon-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries, such as coal mines and coal-fired power sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Just this year, 65 large fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions re­leased new or im­proved poli­cies specif­i­cally on lim­it­ing or end­ing sup­port for coal min­ing and coal power, ac­cord­ing to the In­sti­tute for En­ergy Eco­nom­ics and Fi­nan­cial Anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>In 30 years, if all these com­mit­ments are made good, the world will be a very dif­fer­ent place. The economies of 2050 will be pow­ered by clean, re­li­able en­ergy, and will be far more ef­fi­cient and far less waste­ful. The fos­sil fuel era that has pow­ered world growth since the 18th cen­tury will be pretty much over.</p>
    <p>The Paris Agree­ment is a road map to that des­ti­na­tion. It sets a way for all na­tions to com­mit to emis­sions re­duc­tions and then agree to steadily ramp these up this decade.</p>
    <p>WARN­ING SIGNS</p>
    <p>There are plenty of signs that cli­mate ac­tion needs to be stepped up.</p>
    <p>This year is fore­cast to be among the three warm­est on record, the UN World Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Or­gan­i­sa­tion said, and the grow­ing im­pact from ex­treme weather, from storms to wild­fires, is in­creas­ingly ev­i­dent.</p>
    <p>At a Cli­mate Am­bi­tion Sum­mit last week­end co-hosted by the UN, Bri­tain and France to mark the Paris Agree­ment’s fifth an­niver­sary, dozens of coun­tries put for­ward new pledges for 2030.</p>
    <p>But these are not enough to pre­vent dan­ger­ous warm­ing this cen­tury, said Mr Alok Sharma, the Bri­tish min­is­ter re­spon­si­ble for lead­ing UN cli­mate talks in the run-up to next year’s ma­jor con­fer­ence in Glas­gow.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the vir­tual sum­mit, UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said gov­ern­ments should de­clare a state of cli­mate emer­gency and crit­i­cised Covid-19 stim­u­lus fund­ing for fos­sil fu­els. “So far, the mem­bers of the Group of 20 are spend­ing 50 per cent more in their stim­u­lus and res­cue pack­ages on sec­tors linked to fos­sil fuel pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion than on low-car­bon en­ergy. This is unac­cept­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last week, a group of non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions re­leased a study that showed ma­jor fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have pro­vided US$2.7 tril­lion (S$3.6 tril­lion) in fos­sil fuel fund­ing for a dozen ma­jor projects since the Paris Agree­ment was sealed in De­cem­ber 2015. The emis­sions from these projects could scup­per chances of hold­ing warm­ing to 1.5 deg C, the authors say.</p>
    <p>For now, things re­main on a knife-edge. Fos­sil fu­els re­main cen­tral to economies but re­new­ables are quickly ex­pand­ing to meet new en­ergy de­mand growth. With the right pol­i­tics and stim­u­lus, the green revo­lu­tion could hap­pen much faster, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>HOPE IN GREEN TECH</p>
    <p>A re­port re­leased last week by con­sul­tancy Sys­temiq found that green tech­no­log­i­cal change is hap­pen­ing much faster than peo­ple re­alise and, in­creas­ingly, com­pa­nies are find­ing that go­ing green is good for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The re­port, The Paris Ef­fect: How The Cli­mate Change Agree­ment Is Re­shap­ing The Global Econ­omy, high­lights how re­new­able en­ergy costs this year plunged to lev­els that, just six years ago, the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency pre­dicted would not be reached un­til 2050.</p>
    <p>It also shows that in 2015, low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies and so­lu­tions were un­com­pet­i­tive in all ma­jor eco­nomic sec­tors but this year, they are al­ready at cost par­ity in 25 per cent of the global econ­omy, most no­tably the power sec­tor.</p>
    <p>By 2030, low-car­bon so­lu­tions could dis­place car­bon-in­ten­sive tech­nolo­gies across 70 per cent of the econ­omy, in sec­tors in­clud­ing light road trans­port, build­ing heat­ing, truck­ing and agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“Our as­sess­ment of progress to­wards these mar­ket tip­ping points brings us to the cen­tral find­ing of the re­port, which is that progress and low-car­bon so­lu­tions have been far faster than many re­alise and could take off dra­mat­i­cally over the next 10 years,” said co-au­thor Ju­lia Turner of Sys­temiq.</p>
    <p>And that’s the prom­ise of the Paris Agree­ment: the col­lec­tive vi­sion to change the world that del­e­gates from nearly 200 na­tions agreed on that win­try day at the makeshift con­fer­ence cen­tre at Le Bour­get air­field.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment laid the foun­da­tion for ac­tion and set clear tar­gets backed by sci­ence. The tech­nol­ogy to cre­ate a green in­dus­trial revo­lu­tion is there or quickly com­ing into view. And in­creas­ingly, the pub­lic and most busi­nesses and gov­ern­ments are push­ing for green economies.</p>
    <p>But this is the decade that could well make or break the fight against cli­mate change. Af­ter the pan­demic, emis­sions need to keep fall­ing and green spend­ing from busi­nesses to in­vestors to gov­ern­ments needs to be main­tained to keep the world on a safer path.</p>
