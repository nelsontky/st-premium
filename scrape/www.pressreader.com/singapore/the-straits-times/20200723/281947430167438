    <p>The war against Covid-19 here is pro­ceed­ing smoothly, mainly on three fronts. Sin­ga­pore is en­ter­ing its fi­nal phase of test­ing and clear­ing all for­eign work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries of the coro­n­avirus, which can be done pos­si­bly be­fore mid-Au­gust. That would rep­re­sent a sub­stan­tial achieve­ment in manag­ing the cri­sis that erupted with the ap­pear­ance of clus­ters in the dorms. Manag­ing, con­trol­ling and con­tain­ing that out­break took a gi­gan­tic ef­fort, given that about 94 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases are dorm res­i­dents. But it is bear­ing fruit now. Tak­ing care of for­eign work­ers and get­ting them back to work are cru­cial from both a pub­lic health and an economic per­spec­tive. That is the first front.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond, com­pris­ing im­ported cases, oc­cu­pies a smaller stretch of the bat­tle­field, but needs ex­treme vig­i­lance too. The ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment re­mains fluid and wor­ry­ing. At its worst, that en­vi­ron­ment is char­ac­terised by coun­tries where the pan­demic con­tin­ues to spread, and quickly. At its best, na­tions that con­trolled the virus are wit­ness­ing a resur­gence of cases. It is proper in the cir­cum­stances for Sin­ga­pore­ans to avoid travel and shore up on bor­der con­trols. The tight­en­ing of re­stric­tions on those with re­cent travel his­tory, in­clud­ing tran­sit, to Vic­to­ria in Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and Hong Kong is an in­stance of the need to re­view and up­date bor­der mea­sures based on the lat­est as­sess­ment of the global sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion re­mains the third and no less cru­cial front. Strict bor­der con­trols help pre­vent in­fec­tion from im­ported cases, while de­ci­sive ac­tion on the sit­u­a­tion in for­eign work­ers’ dorms com­ple­ments that process. How­ever, there still is a need to en­sure that com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions re­main very low. Sin­ga­pore’s strat­egy is to de­tect and ring-fence lo­cal trans­mis­sions. It is do­ing so by hav­ing scaled up test­ing sig­nif­i­cantly for those di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion over the past few weeks. This move has helped to pick up new cases, which are an im­por­tant in­di­ca­tor of un­der­ly­ing com­mu­nity spread. Thank­fully, the num­ber of un­linked cur­rent in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity re­mains low.</p>
    <p>But the chal­lenge is to main­tain the de­gree of con­ti­nu­ity and con­sis­tency that has been achieved in the fight against Covid-19 so far. Meet­ing this chal­lenge rests on the shoul­ders of Sin­ga­pore­ans. It is a nat­u­ral temp­ta­tion to let de­fences down when the worst of a battle ap­pears to have passed. After all, the cir­cuit breaker has been lifted, and peo­ple are freer to move around now. Whether at work or in com­mu­nity in­ter­ac­tions, the sense of fear that in­spired com­pli­ance to strict cir­cuit breaker mea­sures is re­ced­ing. Peo­ple may think that the new “peace” will hold. How­ever, the war against Covid-19 is far from over. Safe man­age­ment mea­sures and prac­tices must re­main sec­ond na­ture for some time to come.</p>
