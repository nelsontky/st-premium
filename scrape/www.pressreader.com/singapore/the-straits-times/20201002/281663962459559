    <p>Con­ser­va­tives are on the de­cline. Com­pared with five years ago, the pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans la­belled as po­lit­i­cally con­ser­va­tive has shrunk by more than half: from 44.3 per cent to 18.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>This cat­e­gory of vot­ers is de­scribed in the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies (IPS) post-GE2020 sur­vey, whose find­ings were re­leased yes­ter­day, as those who dis­agree with the need for change in the elec­toral sys­tem, checks and bal­ances, and dif­fer­ent voices in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the pro­por­tion in the swing cat­e­gory – de­fined as be­ing mixed in their views com­pared with the plu­ral­ists and con­ser­va­tives – has shot up by more than 20 points to 59.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Plu­ral­ists, or those who de­sire more po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity, rose slightly by 4.4 per­cent­age points to 22.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Dr Teo Kay Key said the surge in the swing cat­e­gory is sur­pris­ing, given that most would ex­pect stronger growth in the pro­por­tion of plu­ral­ists amid calls for more op­po­si­tion pres­ence in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps peo­ple want some kind of rep­re­sen­ta­tion and some checks and bal­ances, but not all the way to the plu­ral­ist end,” said Dr Teo, a post­doc­toral fel­low at the IPS So­cial Lab who is also on the sur­vey team. “(Plu­ral­ist) de­mands may have been tem­pered by other gov­er­nance is­sues such as the need for ef­fi­cient govern­ment, which is one of the top three is­sues shap­ing vot­ing de­ci­sions among all three cat­e­gories.”</p>
    <p>The IPS team stressed that the sur­vey re­sults re­flect the re­spon­dents’ concerns and po­lit­i­cal pref­er­ences, but do not tell ex­actly which party they voted for in GE2020.</p>
    <p>In the pre­ced­ing three gen­eral elec­tions, plu­ral­ists had al­ways been younger – es­pe­cially those aged 21 to 29 – and univer­sity-ed­u­cated, as well as more well-off.</p>
    <p>But what stood out in GE2020 was the in­crease in their pro­por­tion among the low­est­in­come house­holds earn­ing less than $2,000 a month, and those with non-ter­tiary post-sec­ondary qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>IPS said this points to two ef­fects tak­ing place. First, the con­sis­tent trend of those in the higher so­cio-eco­nomic class sup­port­ing po­lit­i­cal plu­ral­ism. Sec­ond, the ef­fects of bread-and-but­ter is­sues at the other end of the so­cioe­co­nomic spec­trum, such that vot­ers felt there was a need for po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment.</p>
