    <p>BRING­ING ART TO SE­NIORS</p>
    <p>When Madam Leow, 79, saw a replica of Ice Ball Man, a 1978 paint­ing that de­picts an In­dian ven­dor of the pop­u­lar shaved ice treat typ­i­cally driz­zled in evap­o­rated milk and colour­ful syrup, it brought back mem­o­ries of her child­hood.</p>
    <p>Madam Leow, a client at daycare cen­tre Sheng Hong Ac­tive Age­ing Hub, is one of eight se­niors there par­tic­i­pat­ing in an art ther­apy trial pro­gramme which was launched by the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) and Her­itage Con­ser­va­tion Cen­tre yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme in­volves bring­ing five repli­cas of paint­ings – fea­tur­ing parts of Sin­ga­pore in the 1970s to 1980s – to se­niors in six nurs­ing homes and se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Fa­cil­i­tated by an art ther­a­pist via video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom, the se­niors are prompted to share their ob­ser­va­tions of the paint­ings and, in the process, jog mem­o­ries of their past.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Tan, deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of pol­icy and com­mu­nity at NHB, said he hopes the paint­ings and art ther­apy work­shops will bring about deeper re­flec­tions and foster con­nec­tions among se­niors.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has ef­fec­tively put a stop to mu­seum vis­its in­volv­ing se­niors from nurs­ing homes and ac­tiv­ity cen­tres, so we had to in­no­vate and de­velop a pro­gramme to bring our art­works to where the se­niors are,” he said.</p>
    <p>The paint­ings de­pict scenes of a bird singing con­test, a pop­u­lar leisure ac­tiv­ity com­monly seen in pub­lic hous­ing es­tates; hawk­ers and pa­trons cel­e­brat­ing Na­tional Day in New­ton hawker cen­tre; a bustling fresh food mar­ket in Ro­chor Canal; and Loyang Kam­pung, a vil­lage which used to ex­ist in the east­ern part of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They were painted by local pi­o­neer artists Chua Mia Tee, Lee Boon Wang and Leng Joon Wong.</p>
    <p>The repli­cas will be at each nurs­ing home or se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tre for one week at a time, where an hour-long ses­sion will be con­ducted for a group of eight se­niors.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, craft ac­tiv­i­ties such as mak­ing photo frames us­ing re­cy­cled news­pa­per and fab­ric strips will be con­ducted by an art ther­a­pist via Zoom to en­cour­age se­niors to im­prove their dex­ter­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that based on feed­back from the trial, which runs from this month to next month, NHB hopes to scale up the pro­gramme to in­clude more se­niors and other un­der­served com­mu­ni­ties such as youth at risk.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has ef­fec­tively put a stop to mu­seum vis­its in­volv­ing se­niors from nurs­ing homes and ac­tiv­ity cen­tres, so we had to in­no­vate and de­velop a pro­gramme to bring our art­works to where the se­niors are.</p>
