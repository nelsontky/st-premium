    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Home Sec­re­tary Priti Pa­tel said yes­ter­day she would call the po­lice to re­port any­one who flouted a new ban on gath­er­ings of more than six peo­ple, sug­gest­ing that peo­ple who stopped for a chat on the street were break­ing new coro­n­avirus laws.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 cases across the United King­dom has risen sharply in re­cent weeks, prompt­ing the gov­ern­ment to bring in the new rules to re­strict so­cial­is­ing, at the same time as health bosses have said there are prob­lems with ac­cess­ing tests.</p>
    <p>Ms Pa­tel said that peo­ple needed to help stop the spread of the dis­ease, and that in­cluded call­ing the po­lice on neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>She even sug­gested that fam­i­lies should not min­gle with friends they bumped into on the street. “If I saw some­thing that I thought was in­ap­pro­pri­ate, then quite frankly I would ef­fec­tively call the po­lice,” she told Sky News.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about dob­bing in neigh­bours, I think it’s all about us tak­ing per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity. If there was a big party tak­ing place, it would be right to call the po­lice.”</p>
    <p>Asked to de­fine “min­gling” – also not al­lowed un­der the new rules – she said it was “peo­ple com­ing to­gether” and that if two fam­i­lies of four stopped for a chat in the street, they would be in­fring­ing the law.</p>
    <p>Ms Pa­tel added that tests were avail­able for peo­ple in their lo­cal ar­eas, and that Pub­lic Health Eng­land was adding ca­pac­ity and en­sur­ing more testing was avail­able on a daily ba­sis. “The ma­jor­ity of tests are avail­able within a 16km ra­dius,” she told BBC TV, al­though she con­ceded that in some ex­treme cases, peo­ple would not be able to get a test within that ra­dius.</p>
