    <p>If you in­crease your heart rate, will your life span fol­low?</p>
    <p>That pos­si­bil­ity is at the heart of an am­bi­tious new study of ex­er­cise and mor­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>The study, one of the largest and long­est-term ex­per­i­men­tal ex­am­i­na­tions to date of ex­er­cise and mor­tal­ity, shows that older men and women who ex­er­cise in al­most any fash­ion are rel­a­tively un­likely to die pre­ma­turely. But if some of that ex­er­cise is in­tense, the study also finds, the risk of early mor­tal­ity de­clines even more, and the qual­ity of peo­ple’s lives climbs.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have known for some time, of course, that ac­tive peo­ple tend also to be long-lived peo­ple. Ac­cord­ing to mul­ti­ple past stud­ies, reg­u­lar ex­er­cise is strongly as­so­ci­ated with greater longevity, even if the ex­er­cise amounts to only a few min­utes a week.</p>
    <p>But al­most all of these stud­ies have been ob­ser­va­tional, mean­ing they looked at peo­ple’s lives at a mo­ment in time, de­ter­mined how much they moved at that point, and later checked to see whether and when they died. Such stud­ies can pin­point as­so­ci­a­tions be­tween ex­er­cise and life spans, but they can­not prove that mov­ing ac­tu­ally causes peo­ple to live longer, only that ac­tiv­ity and longevity are linked.</p>
    <p>To find out if ex­er­cise di­rectly af­fects life spans, re­searchers would have to en­rol vol­un­teers in longterm, ran­domised con­trolled tri­als, with some peo­ple ex­er­cis­ing, while oth­ers work out dif­fer­ently or not at all. The re­searchers then would have to fol­low all of these peo­ple for years, un­til a sufficient­ly large num­ber died to al­low for sta­tis­ti­cal com­par­isons of the groups.</p>
    <p>Such stud­ies, how­ever, are daunt­ingly com­pli­cated and ex­pen­sive, one rea­son they are rarely done. They may also be lim­ited, since over the course of a typ­i­cal ex­per­i­ment, few adults may die. This is prov­i­den­tial for those who en­rol in the study but prob­lem­atic for the sci­en­tists hop­ing to study mor­tal­ity; with scant deaths, they can­not tell if ex­er­cise is hav­ing a mean­ing­ful im­pact on life spans.</p>
    <p>FEW SUB­JECTS SEDEN­TARY</p>
    <p>Those ob­sta­cles did not de­ter a group of ex­er­cise sci­en­tists at the Nor­we­gian Univer­sity of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy in Trond­heim, how­ever.</p>
    <p>With col­leagues from other in­sti­tu­tions, they had been study­ing the im­pacts of var­i­ous types of ex­er­cise on heart dis­ease and fit­ness and felt the ob­vi­ous next step was to look at longevity. So, al­most 10 years ago, they be­gan plan­ning the study that would be pub­lished in Oc­to­ber in The BMJ.</p>
    <p>Their first step was to in­vite ev­ery sep­tu­a­ge­nar­ian in Trond­heim to par­tic­i­pate. Mor­tal­ity stud­ies in­volv­ing older peo­ple are the most likely to re­turn use­ful data, the sci­en­tists rea­soned, since, re­al­is­ti­cally, there will be more deaths among the el­derly than the young, mak­ing it pos­si­ble to com­pare dif­fer­ences in longevity be­tween study groups.</p>
    <p>More than 1,500 of the Nor­we­gian men and women ac­cepted. These vol­un­teers were, in gen­eral, health­ier than most 70-year-olds. Some had heart dis­ease, can­cer or other con­di­tions, but most reg­u­larly walked or oth­er­wise re­mained ac­tive. Few were obese. All agreed to start and con­tinue to ex­er­cise more reg­u­larly dur­ing the up­com­ing five years.</p>
    <p>SE­NIORS TRACKED FOR 5 YEARS</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists tested ev­ery­one’s cur­rent aer­o­bic fit­ness as well as their sub­jec­tive feel­ings about the qual­ity of their lives and then ran­domly as­signed them to one of three groups. The first, as a con­trol, agreed to fol­low standard ac­tiv­ity guide­lines and walk or oth­er­wise re­main in mo­tion for half an hour most days. (The sci­en­tists did not feel they could eth­i­cally ask their con­trol group to be seden­tary for five years.)</p>
    <p>An­other group be­gan ex­er­cis­ing mod­er­ately for longer ses­sions of 50 min­utes twice a week. And the third group started a pro­gramme of twice-weekly high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing, or HIIT, dur­ing which they cy­cled or jogged at a stren­u­ous pace for four min­utes, fol­lowed by four min­utes of rest, with that se­quence re­peated four times.</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery­one kept up their as­signed ex­er­cise rou­tines for five years, an eter­nity in sci­ence, re­turn­ing pe­ri­od­i­cally to the lab for check-ins, tests and su­per­vised group work­outs. Dur­ing that time, the sci­en­tists noted that quite a few of the par­tic­i­pants in the con­trol group had dab­bled with in­ter­val-train­ing classes at lo­cal gyms, on their own ini­tia­tive and ap­par­ently for fun. The other groups did not al­ter their rou­tines.</p>
    <p>Af­ter five years, the re­searchers checked death reg­istries and found that about 4.6 per cent of all of the orig­i­nal vol­un­teers had died dur­ing the study, a lower num­ber than in the wider Nor­we­gian pop­u­la­tion of 70-year-olds, in­di­cat­ing these ac­tive older peo­ple were, on the whole, liv­ing longer than oth­ers of their age.</p>
    <p>But they also found in­ter­est­ing, if slight, dis­tinc­tions be­tween the groups. The men and women in the high-in­ten­sity-in­ter­vals group were about 2 per cent less likely to have died than those in the con­trol group, and 3 per cent less likely to die than any­one in the longer, mod­er­ate-ex­er­cise group.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in the mod­er­ate group were, in fact, more likely to have died than peo­ple in the con­trol group.</p>
    <p>The men and women in the in­ter­val group also were more fit now and re­ported greater gains in their qual­ity of life than the other vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>KEEP UP THAT PACE</p>
    <p>In essence, says Dorthe Stensvold, a re­searcher at the Nor­we­gian Univer­sity of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy who led the new study, in­tense train­ing – which was part of the rou­tines of both the in­ter­val and con­trol groups – pro­vided slightly better pro­tec­tion against pre­ma­ture death than mod­er­ate work­outs alone.</p>
    <p>Of course, ex­er­cise was not a panacea, she adds. Some peo­ple still sick­ened and died, what­ever their workout pro­gramme. (No one died while ex­er­cis­ing.) This study also fo­cused on Nor­we­gians, who tend to be preter­nat­u­rally healthy, and most of us, per­haps re­gret­tably, are not Nor­we­gians. We also may not yet be in our 70s.</p>
    <p>But Dr Stensvold be­lieves the study’s mes­sage can be broadly ap­pli­ca­ble to al­most all of us.</p>
    <p>“We should try to in­clude some ex­er­cise with high in­ten­sity,” she says. “In­ter­vals are safe and fea­si­ble for most peo­ple. And adding life to years, not only years to life, is an important as­pect of healthy age­ing, and the higher fit­ness and health-re­lated qual­ity of life from HIIT in this study is an important find­ing.”</p>
