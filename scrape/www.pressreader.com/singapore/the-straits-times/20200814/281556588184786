    <p>The In­dus­try De­vel­op­ment Plan, rolled out yesterday, is a new plan for Sin­ga­pore’s train­ing and adult ed­u­ca­tion in­dus­try, with the sec­tor set to play a key role in equip­ping work­ers with the skills they need for op­por­tu­ni­ties com­ing their way.</p>
    <p>The path to pick­ing up new skills amid the job un­cer­tain­ties brought on by the Covid-19 pan­demic is set to be­come eas­ier – for work­ers and their train­ers alike.</p>
    <p>More lessons and train­ing re­sources will be de­liv­ered on­line. A cus­tomised cur­ricu­lum could be de­vel­oped for each learner for smarter coach­ing.</p>
    <p>More train­ing will also be led by in­dus­try and con­ducted at work­places to make it more rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>The changes will fol­low a new plan for Sin­ga­pore’s train­ing and adult ed­u­ca­tion in­dus­try, which was rolled out yesterday, with the sec­tor set to play a key role in equip­ping work­ers with the skills they need for op­por­tu­ni­ties com­ing their way.</p>
    <p>The In­dus­try De­vel­op­ment Plan (IDP) will di­rectly im­pact 20,000 work­ers across pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tions, cor­po­rate train­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions, and pub­lic sec­tor train­ing in­sti­tu­tions like the Civil Ser­vice Col­lege Sin­ga­pore. It will also change the way thou­sands of lo­cal work­ers are taught new skills.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the launch of the plan at the bi­en­nial Adult Learn­ing Sym­po­sium, Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and Man­power Gan Siow Huang said Covid-19 has al­ready brought about a fun­da­men­tal trans­for­ma­tion of the work­place and class­room. “There has never been a stronger need for work­ers to adapt by shift­ing into new job roles and pick­ing up new skills,” she said.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the train­ing sec­tor it­self will not be spared from the dis­rup­tion that work­ers and busi­nesses across Sin­ga­pore are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing to­day, she added. That is why she sug­gested that it should deepen tie-ups with in­dus­try and con­duct more train­ing at work­places.</p>
    <p>The sec­tor also needs to sharpen its dig­i­tal edge and of­fer more on­line learn­ing, she said.</p>
    <p>To help adult ed­u­ca­tors and train­ers in this jour­ney, the au­thor­i­ties have put to­gether pre-ap­proved dig­i­tal learn­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“Train­ing providers can use such plat­forms to cre­ate and de­liver dig­i­tal con­tent to learn­ers on­line any time, any­where,” said Ms Gan.</p>
    <p>She pointed to ex­ist­ing sub­si­dies of up to 80 per cent un­der the Pro­duc­tiv­ity So­lu­tions Grant for those tak­ing this route.</p>
    <p>A new ini­tia­tive will also be launched next month. Over the next three years, it aims to pair 200 train­ing providers with dig­i­tal cur­ricu­lum de­vel­op­ers who will guide them in cre­at­ing and de­liv­er­ing on­line lessons.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate train­ers and ed­u­ca­tors will also be pro­vided with a stepby-step guide on the dig­i­tal so­lu­tions and new skills needed as the in­dus­try piv­ots to­wards new ways of de­liv­er­ing lessons. And when a new Na­tional Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for Work­place Learn­ing is launched later this year, they will get help in de­vel­op­ing the skills of their own em­ploy­ees, said Ms Gan.</p>
    <p>“But the dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion of the (adult ed­u­ca­tion) sec­tor needs to go deeper than pro­vid­ing more on­line learn­ing,” she added. “Train­ing providers... need to fun­da­men­tally dig­i­talise your or­gan­i­sa­tions in or­der to un­lock op­er­a­tional ef­fi­cien­cies, stream­line rou­tine pro­cesses, and glean in­sights from data.” The new IDP will guide train­ing providers for small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in this jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Re­cruit­ment agency Adecco Sin­ga­pore’s coun­try man­ager Be­tul Genc said de­mand for tal­ent with IT ex­per­tise is likely to keep grow­ing as busi­nesses dig­i­talise in re­sponse to the pan­demic, es­pe­cially in ar­eas such as cy­ber se­cu­rity. He added: “The train­ing and adult ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor has to play a col­lab­o­ra­tive and en­gag­ing role with both em­ploy­ers and tal­ent to keep up to date on emerg­ing or in-de­mand skills. It also has to go in-depth into the chal­lenges (en­coun­tered) in en­cour­ag­ing up­skilling and reskilling.”</p>
