    <p>A part-time su­per­mar­ket cashier copied the bank card details of 34 cus­tomers into a note­book and used the in­for­ma­tion to make 1,011 unau­tho­rised ez-link top-up trans­ac­tions to­talling $41,330.</p>
    <p>Kas Qiu Caiy­ing, 30, then trav­elled to a num­ber of MRT sta­tions to seek cash re­funds from the more than 500 ez-link cards she had used to store the monies.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to eight months’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to 11 charges un­der the Com­puter Mis­use Act in­volv­ing more than $28,000. Twenty-four other sim­i­lar charges linked to the re­main­ing amount were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Ben Mathias Tan said that Qiu was em­ployed by the su­per­mar­ket in Wood­lands Av­enue 1 be­tween Jan­uary and</p>
    <p>Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>She was also hold­ing a full-time job from April that year as an op­er­a­tions ex­ec­u­tive at the gov­ern­men­trun Se­larang Half­way House, which pro­vides af­ter­care sup­port to se­lected former of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that she is no longer work­ing at the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Some time in Au­gust 2018, she ob­tained the name and NRIC num­ber of one of the residents at the half­way house from a com­puter ter­mi­nal and used the details to cre­ate an ez-link mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion user ac­count on her mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>The res­i­dent was not aware that Qiu had used his par­tic­u­lars to cre­ate the ac­count, the court heard.</p>
    <p>The DPP added: “The ac­cused then keyed in the credit and debit card details that she had ob­tained into the ez-link ac­count in or­der to top up var­i­ous ez-link cards with amounts rang­ing from $10 to $100.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused per­formed the top­ups by plac­ing the said ez-link cards against (her mo­bile phone) which had a ‘near field com­mu­ni­ca­tion’ func­tion.” Qiu made the top-up trans­ac­tions from Au­gust to De­cem­ber 2018 be­fore ob­tain­ing cash re­funds from the cards.</p>
    <p>A bank op­er­a­tions clerk alerted the po­lice on Dec 11, 2018, say­ing the bank had re­ceived mul­ti­ple re­ports from its credit and debit card hold­ers on unau­tho­rised trans­ac­tions made to an ez-link ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers later ar­rested Qiu, who made a par­tial resti­tu­tion of $9,132 on March 5 this year.</p>
    <p>She has since con­sented for more than $30,000 in her bank ac­count to be ap­plied to­wards resti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der the Act, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000. Re­peat of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to three years and fined up to $10,000.</p>
