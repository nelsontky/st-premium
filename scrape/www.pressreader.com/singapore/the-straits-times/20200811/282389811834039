    <p>When Ja­panese tidy­ing guru Marie Kondo en­vi­sioned her new book, she saw her­self bring­ing her phi­los­o­phy of “spark­ing joy” from the home to the work­place – even if joy is the last thing many peo­ple ex­pect from their job.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Amer­i­can or­gan­i­sa­tional psy­chol­o­gist Scott So­nen­shein, she would ad­vise read­ers on how to de­clut­ter their work spa­ces – phys­i­cally, dig­i­tally and men­tally – in Joy At Work (above).</p>
    <p>Then, the Covid-19 pan­demic struck. Kondo, like the rest of the world, found her­self work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>“It is a chal­leng­ing and un­cer­tain time,” ad­mits the 35-year-old in an e-mail in­ter­view. “My chil­dren are home all day, our of­fices are closed and ma­jor busi­ness ini­tia­tives – such as me­dia tours to sup­port my work and photo shoots for our digital con­tent and e-com­merce – have been post­poned.”</p>
    <p>Still, she says, she is us­ing the time to test new strate­gies.</p>
    <p>She has con­ducted dozens of in­ter­views over Zoom in­stead of trav­el­ling. Her hus­band Takumi Kawa­hara, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of her brand KonMari, is dou­bling as her pho­tog­ra­pher. She checks in on the com­mu­nity of Kondo acolytes via In­sta­gram Sto­ries.</p>
    <p>“With ev­ery­one so far apart, it feels im­por­tant to con­nect in what­ever way we can,” she says.</p>
    <p>Kondo’s name be­came a by­word for de­clut­ter­ing af­ter the run­away suc­cess of her first book, The LifeChang­ing Magic Of Tidy­ing Up (2011), which has been trans­lated into 40 lan­guages and sold more than 11 mil­lion copies world­wide.</p>
    <p>She was listed as one of Time magazine’s 100 most in­flu­en­tial peo­ple in 2015. Her 2019 Net­flix show, Tidy­ing Up With Marie Kondo, fur­ther ce­mented the KonMari brand as not sim­ply a tidy­ing method, but also a way of life.</p>
    <p>Fame had its down­sides, how­ever. There came a point when she was so busy trav­el­ling for me­dia ap­pear­ances – while still tidy­ing for clients – that she had no time for her­self. Her life­style had ceased to spark joy.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised if I am not feel­ing joy, I will be un­able to com­mu­ni­cate joy to oth­ers,” she says. “I learnt to bal­ance my­self by ad­just­ing my time at work and hav­ing oth­ers help me.”</p>
    <p>Kondo has been fas­ci­nated by tidy­ing since she was five years old and be­came a tidy­ing con­sul­tant at the age of 19 while still a so­ci­ol­ogy stu­dent at Tokyo Woman’s Chris­tian Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing, she got a job at a staffing agency in the cor­po­rate sales depart­ment. She was not, by her own ad­mis­sion, good at it.</p>
    <p>“Of the 15 peo­ple newly em­ployed that year,” she re­calls in her book, “I was al­ways in the bot­tom three... I seemed to be work­ing all the time, yet I never got re­sults.”</p>
    <p>One day, gaz­ing at the mess of her desk – which i ncluded a halfwrit­ten con­tract, a shriv­elled-up tea bag and a pen miss­ing its cap –</p>
    <p>“The first thing I do when I wake is to open the win­dows and light in­cense to pu­rify the air and en­ergy in my home.</p>
    <p>I’ll then make my­self a cup of fresh lemon and hot wa­ter and med­i­tate to start my day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that, I start pre­par­ing a tra­di­tional Ja­panese break­fast for my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>We eat to­gether in the din­ing room and have been en­joy­ing longer meal­times to­gether be­cause, usu­ally, we’re scur­ry­ing off to school af­ter break­fast. My hus­band (Takumi Kawa­hara) and I re­view our most im­por­tant work of the day to align our sched­ules and care­tak­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>I like to tidy up be­fore I of­fi­cially start my work day. I strike a tun­ing fork and dif­fuse es­sen­tial oils to sig­nal to my body I’m switching gears.</p>
    <p>I’ll work for sev­eral hours – writ­ing, plan­ning, con­duct­ing in­ter­views and so on.</p>
    <p>Around 12.30pm, I’ll pre­pare lunch for my daugh­ters, en­joy some play time with them and then re­turn to my of­fice for more work.</p>
    <p>My hus­band, who is the co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of KonMari, and I will usu­ally break around 4pm or so to go for a walk.</p>
    <p>Rather than sit­ting in chairs, we pre­fer to walk and talk out our ideas. We go over up­com­ing projects and global busi­ness strate­gies and share take­aways from in­ter­est­ing ar­ti­cles we’ve read re­cently.</p>
    <p>Af­ter this, I’ll usu­ally check in with the Ja­pan side of the busi­ness. We have a global com­mu­nity, but I am a lit­tle more in­volved with the day to day of our Ja­pan busi­ness be­cause it comes so nat­u­rally to me.</p>
    <p>I’ll start pre­par­ing din­ner with my daugh­ters around 5 or 6pm. Since we’re cook­ing more at home, I’ve been in­volv­ing them in din­ner prepa­ra­tion and mak­ing it playful. They are won­der­ful helpers.”</p>
