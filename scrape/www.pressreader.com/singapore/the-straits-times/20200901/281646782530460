    <p>com­pa­nies that do not im­prove over time, such as re­mov­ing pref­er­en­tial tax rates or not award­ing them pub­lic sec­tor con­tracts.</p>
    <p>He stressed that NTUC is not ad­vo­cat­ing for closed-door poli­cies. But with some 1,200 firms on the FCF watch list, it is clear that market fail­ure ex­ists in the cur­rent em­ploy­ment frame­work, he said.</p>
    <p>“A healthy dose of market in­ter­ven­tion is es­sen­tial to en­sure fair play,” he said, adding that this also fos­ters a sense of be­long­ing and iden­tity among Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>He was among more than 10 MPs who spoke on the hot but­ton is­sue dur­ing yes­ter­day’s de­bate.</p>
    <p>Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) urged the Govern­ment to re­quire com­pa­nies to pub­lish the se­lec­tion cri­te­ria for jobs, not just the job va­cancy it­self. In do­ing so, the cri­te­ria can be scru­ti­nised.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Tay, she sug­gested im­ple­ment­ing a de­pen­dency ra­tio or quota for EP hold­ers in com­pa­nies, with dif­fer­ent ceil­ings and salary lev­els for dif­fer­ent sec­tors, and to make sure se­nior man­agers are ac­count­able for the hir­ing of th­ese EP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC) sug­gested the Govern­ment ex­pand the Ca­pa­bil­ity Trans­fer Pro­gramme to nudge com­pa­nies to set tar­gets for firms to trans­fer skills and knowl­edge from for­eign to lo­cal work­ers. This pro­gramme sub­sidises the cost of bring­ing in train­ers from abroad to equip lo­cal work­ers with skills and knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Ms Jes­sica Tan (East Coast GRC), speak­ing from her per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence in work­ing for two for­eign multi­na­tion­als for al­most 30 years, said work­ing with for­eign­ers can help Sin­ga­pore­ans de­velop them­selves and scale up large projects.</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, hinges on fair em­ploy­ment prac­tices, she stressed, adding that em­ploy­ers must also have clear de­vel­op­ment plans to grow the Sin­ga­porean core and build a pipe­line of lo­cals to fill se­nior roles.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should view Sin­ga­pore­ans favourably when hir­ing and re­tain cit­i­zens over for­eign­ers if re­trench­ment can­not be avoided, said Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and Ed­u­ca­tion Gan Siow Huang.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a strong Sin­ga­porean pres­ence in a com­pany also en­hances the re­silience of the busi­ness in times when bor­der con­trols can have an im­pact on the sup­ply of for­eign work­ers, she added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, Ms Gan said: “In the cur­rent cri­sis where there are not enough jobs for lo­cals, we need to work with em­ploy­ers so that Sin­ga­porean job seek­ers will be viewed favourably when ap­ply­ing for jobs, es­pe­cially given the govern­ment in­cen­tives.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing af­ter Sin­ga­porean em­ploy­ees also strength­ens trust be­tween them and the em­ployer, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan also pro­vided an update on the SGUnited Jobs and Skills pro­gramme. As of July, the Govern­ment and tri­par­tite part­ners have helped 25,000 peo­ple link up with new op­por­tu­ni­ties, she said. Of the re­main­ing places avail­able, there are over 47,000 jobs, 16,000 trainee­ships and more than 10,000 train­ing places, she added.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing the height­ened sense of anx­i­ety among Sin­ga­pore­ans about job se­cu­rity, Ms Gan said: “In cir­cum­stances where re­trench­ment is un­avoid­able, and an em­ployer has to choose be­tween a for­eigner and a Sin­ga­porean, I urge the em­ployer to lean to­wards keep­ing the Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>“In short, if em­ploy­ers must re­trench, re­tain the Sin­ga­porean over the for­eigner.”</p>
    <p>This should be done for jobs like en­gi­neers and IT pro­fes­sion­als. This first cat­e­gory of jobs are those Sin­ga­pore­ans want to and can do, but for which for­eign­ers are needed dur­ing pe­ri­ods of eco­nomic growth to help meet de­mand, she said.</p>
    <p>For the sec­ond cat­e­gory of jobs, in es­sen­tial ser­vices such as con­struc­tion and clean­ing – which are not so pop­u­lar with Sin­ga­pore­ans de­spite ef­forts to trans­form them – the aim should be to re­duce the re­liance on for­eign­ers through job re­design and tech­nol­ogy adop­tion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the con­struc­tion sec­tor has cre­ated new and higher-skilled jobs through De­sign for Man­u­fac­tur­ing and Assem­bly, which re­quires more pro­duc­tion man­agers, qual­ity as­sur­ance per­son­nel, and lo­gis­tics and sup­ply chain plan­ners, now that con­struc­tion work has shifted off­site to au­to­mated pro­duc­tion fa­cil­i­ties, said Ms Gan.</p>
    <p>For the third cat­e­gory of jobs, in global and re­gional com­pa­nies that re­quire global teams and cer­tain pro­fes­sion­als with highly spe­cialised skills, the aim is to have Sin­ga­pore­ans as part of di­verse teams. The Govern­ment also wants such com­pa­nies to groom lo­cal tal­ent so that Sin­ga­pore­ans have a fair shot at se­nior and top man­age­ment po­si­tions, said Ms Gan.</p>
    <p>She cited the ex­pe­ri­ence of Ms Tan Chee Wei, 46, vice-pres­i­dent of hu­man re­sources for the Asian re­gion at en­ergy gi­ant Shell, who rose through the ranks from a hu­man re­sources gen­er­al­ist over the last 18 years. In be­tween, she spent a few years in Lon­don as a global HR ad­viser and also took on re­gional roles in or­gan­i­sa­tional de­vel­op­ment and tal­ent man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan said that to re­duce the na­tion’s re­liance on for­eign­ers in a sus­tained way, work pro­duc­tiv­ity must be in­creased to bring down the over­all de­mand for labour as the pop­u­la­tion ages. The to­tal fer­til­ity rate also needs to rise such that a critical mass of Sin­ga­pore­ans is main­tained in the labour force.</p>
    <p>She also spoke about the im­por­tance of in­vest­ing in build­ing up skills so that the lo­cal work­force will be adap­tive and skilled in di­verse fields, and re­main highly em­ploy­able in the face of dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan said the Govern­ment will do its best to en­sure fair op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans to get jobs, and sup­port Sin­ga­pore­ans in ac­quir­ing skills.</p>
    <p>She said: “We will spare no ef­fort to strengthen the Sin­ga­porean core, and walk the jour­ney with ev­ery Sin­ga­porean. Be­cause our peo­ple are our only as­set, and ev­ery Sin­ga­porean counts.”</p>
