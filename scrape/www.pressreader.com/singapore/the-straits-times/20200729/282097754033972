    <p>We thank Mr Woon Wee Min for his views and feed­back (Sin­ga­pore Premier League must do more to en­gage fans, July 23).</p>
    <p>Since the Sin­ga­pore Premier League’s (SPL) re­vamp in 2018, the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) has con­sis­tently looked for ways to in­crease the level of en­gage­ment with our fans as well as to make it eas­ier for them to watch their favourite teams.</p>
    <p>This sea­son is the first time fans are able to watch every match live on tele­vi­sion, on ei­ther Sing­tel or StarHub.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, all the matches are be­ing live-streamed on our so­cial me­dia pages.</p>
    <p>Prior to the start of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the SPL saw im­pres­sive at­ten­dances in its open­ing matches, with the match between Tan­jong Pa­gar United FC and Lion City Sailors FC at­tract­ing over 2,700 fans to the sta­dium.</p>
    <p>When fix­tures were re­quired to be played be­hind closed doors, close to 79,000 fans tuned in on the var­i­ous on­line stream­ing plat­forms be­fore the SPL was even­tu­ally sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing phase one of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the FAS rolled out a se­ries of ini­tia­tives to en­sure that our lo­cal foot­ball fra­ter­nity re­mained en­gaged.</p>
    <p>This con­sisted of 11 Ca­pa­bil­ity Devel­op­ment webinars and close to 60 train­ing cour­ses which saw al­most 1,400 par­tic­i­pants tak­ing part to ob­tain tech­ni­cal knowl­edge of in­dus­try best prac­tices. We also added a range of con­tent on our so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>This sea­son is the 25th an­niver­sary of the league, and in re­sponse to fans’ re­quests to re­visit high­lights from pre­vi­ous sea­sons, we have cu­rated 25 of the best matches and are stream­ing them on a weekly ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Over­all, more than 132 hours of con­tent were pro­duced within a three-month pe­riod, which saw a 64 per cent in­crease in fan en­gage­ment com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>Our SPL clubs, such as Tampines Rovers and Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional, have also been ac­tive in their com­mu­nity out­reach, or­gan­is­ing ac­tiv­i­ties such as vir­tual train­ing clin­ics on their re­spec­tive so­cial plat­forms.</p>
    <p>We ap­pre­ci­ate the con­struc­tive feed­back from our fans, and will take on board sug­ges­tions that will help build a vi­brant foot­ball cul­ture and strengthen Sin­ga­pore­ans’ con­nec­tion to lo­cal foot­ball.</p>
