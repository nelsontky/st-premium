    <p>Strong winds and wet weather did not de­ter Sin­ga­pore­ans from mak­ing the most of the long week­end, judg­ing by the busy shopping malls and queues that formed out­side ma­jor at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>New Year’s Day also marked the start of the first week­end in months when peo­ple have been able to meet in groups larger than five, af­ter re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings were eased when phase three be­gan last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times vis­ited Sen­tosa yes­ter­day, a steady stream of peo­ple – in­clud­ing large fam­i­lies and groups of friends – were seen head­ing to­wards at­trac­tions such as Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore de­spite the rain.</p>
    <p>Nearby eater­ies were buzzing, and red-shirted safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors were posted promi­nently around the area.</p>
    <p>“As a par­ent, I was wor­ried that peo­ple would rush to come here since it’s the first week­end of phase three,” said Mr Wick­nesh Maratheyah, who vis­ited the S.E.A. Aquar­ium with his ex­tended fam­ily yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“But I was pleas­antly sur­prised.” His group in­cluded his eight­month-old son, who was born in May dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“I’m hap­pi­est for this guy,” added the 38-year-old, who works in the oil and gas in­dus­try. “It’s his first ma­jor out­ing since he was born.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Hoo, a gen­eral man­ager in a lo­gis­tics firm, who sat down for a meal with his fam­ily of</p>
    <p>six af­ter a visit to Sen­tosa 4D Ad­ven­ture­land, said: “Fi­nally, we can all sit at the same ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, The Sun­day Times also vis­ited pop­u­lar malls and eater­ies to see if the start of phase three meant larger crowds.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral restau­rants said they had put in place ad­di­tional mea­sures to en­sure that din­ers stayed a safe dis­tance from one another.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Sushi Ex­press at 313@Som­er­set has im­ple­mented a 40-minute din­ing limit and also put up tape to en­sure din­ers keep at least 1m apart.</p>
    <p>“We’ve also had one man­ager and staff mem­ber on duty to mon­i­tor the crowd and re­mind din­ers to stay so­cially dis­tanced,” man­ager Jenize So­ri­ano said.</p>
    <p>At Mex­i­can restau­rant Chimichang­a in Hol­land Vil­lage, six large ta­bles were brought out to ac­com­mo­date big groups on New Year’s Eve, and ex­tra se­cu­rity and staff were hired to han­dle the crowds.</p>
    <p>“This long week­end, it was crazy and fully packed only on New Year’s Eve but not on New Year’s Day,” said as­sis­tant man­ager Jerome Wang, at­tribut­ing the lower turnout to heavy rain and cus­tomers par­ty­ing too hard the night be­fore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Andy Tan, a gen­eral manger at Mon­ster Curry and Cafe in Sun­tec City mall, said it is now eas­ier for staff to man­age cus­tomers as large groups no longer have to be split up.</p>
    <p>Mr Lawrence Loh, who was shopping in Sun­tec City with his fam­ily on Fri­day af­ter­noon, said he is very con­scious of where he takes his fam­ily as he has a tod­dler.</p>
    <p>All three of his chil­dren have taken the in­fluenza jab, the IT en­gi­neer added.</p>
    <p>Ms Christina Sagadevon, who was do­ing a spot of back-to-school shopping with her fam­ily in VivoCity yes­ter­day, noted that the mall was not as packed as it would have been be­fore Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>“I would say it’s quite crowded, but at least peo­ple are tak­ing pre­cau­tions,” added the 50-year-old ad­min­is­tra­tive clerk.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it’s be­cause of the long week­end and school re­open­ing soon, so peo­ple are go­ing out to get the things they need.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">The crowds ven&#xAD;tured out of their homes with the eas&#xAD;ing of curbs as phase three be&#xAD;gan. On Fri&#xAD;day, for ex&#xAD;am&#xAD;ple, many din&#xAD;ers were seen at Kai Duck (above) in Ngee Ann City. A line of peo&#xAD;ple (right) also formed to get into a JD Sports out&#xAD;let in ION Or&#xAD;chard.</p>
