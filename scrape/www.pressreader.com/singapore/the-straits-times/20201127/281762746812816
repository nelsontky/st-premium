    <p>Hong Kong Cor­re­spon­dent</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam’s 30,000-word an­nual pol­icy ad­dress on Wed­nes­day lasted more than two hours, which was her long­est thus far, ri­valling that of her pre­de­ces­sor Le­ung Chun Ying.</p>
    <p>The epic speech ap­peared to have made it tough for pro-Bei­jing law­mak­ers in the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil – the only ones left in the Cham­ber af­ter the re­cent exit of the op­po­si­tion bloc – to be en­thralled.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos cir­cu­lat­ing on­line show a num­ber of them nap­ping, with one plac­ing an or­der for HK$9,600 (S$1,660) worth of hairy crabs.</p>
    <p>The 200 or so Bei­jing-backed ini­tia­tives that Mrs Lam pro­posed on Wed­nes­day also ap­peared to have fallen flat, judging by the tepid re­sponse to them. Some even won­dered aloud if the Chief Ex­ec­u­tive had run out of ideas on how to help the ter­ri­tory get over the po­lit­i­cal, so­cial and economic</p>
    <p>crises it now faces.</p>
    <p>In the near fu­ture, the Hong Kong govern­ment has to look to the main­land for help “be­cause</p>
    <p>there is not much room for ma­noeu­vre by Hong Kong it­self, re­ally”, said Dr Willy Lam from the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam de­voted much of her speech to the “ur­gent pri­or­ity” of restor­ing or­der to the con­sti­tu­tional and po­lit­i­cal sys­tem, while prais­ing the ef­fects of the re­cent na­tional se­cu­rity law that she said had re­stored sta­bil­ity to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In­te­gra­tion into the main­land, par­tic­u­larly the Greater Bay Area, fea­tured promi­nently among the poli­cies she out­lined, with the cen­tre­piece be­ing a HK$430 mil­lion Greater Bay Youth Em­ploy­ment Scheme to draw young grad­u­ates to cross the bor­der for work.</p>
    <p>She also high­lighted the amend­ment to two pieces of leg­is­la­tion to beef up the al­le­giance of law­mak­ers, judges and civil ser­vants to the city and to the Ba­sic Law, the ter­ri­tory’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to “en­hance the qual­ity” of teach­ers came as no sur­prise, with ob­servers point­ing out that the pro-es­tab­lish­ment camp had blamed some teach­ers for mis­lead­ing stu­dents into par­tic­i­pat­ing in last year’s un­rest.</p>
    <p>From an economic per­spec­tive, the new ini­tia­tives would strengthen Hong Kong’s role as the gate­way in and out of China, said Ox­ford Eco­nomics’ Dr Tommy</p>
    <p>Wu.</p>
    <p>He said Hong Kong would con­tinue to at­tract Chi­nese com­pa­nies to list their stocks and bonds on its stock ex­change, es­pe­cially given that the United States mar­ket was now less at­trac­tive, in the light of on­go­ing ten­sions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton, as well as changes in US poli­cies to­wards Chi­nese in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>As it is, Chi­nese firms now ac­count for 80 per cent of Hong Kong’s stock mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion, a 10 per­cent­age point rise from just a year ago.</p>
    <p>Over­all, on the econ­omy, Dr Wu be­lieves the govern­ment’s more pru­dent ap­proach was ex­pected, given that it had al­ready rolled out a record-break­ing stim­u­lus pack­age of HK$310 bil­lion or 11.5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct this year.</p>
    <p>PwC Hong Kong tax part­ner Agnes Wong said the youth jobs scheme would in­cen­tivise younger innovation and tech­nol­ogy (I&T) pro­fes­sion­als to ex­plore ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties within the Greater Bay Area cities. This means young Hong Kongers can ben­e­fit from gain­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and skills in the vi­brant I&T sec­tor in cities like Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>In the long term, Hong Kong en­ter­prises will be able to lever­age the ex­pe­ri­ence and skills ac­quired by these young em­ploy­ees in main­land cities for their busi­ness op­er­a­tions, which will ex­tend Hong Kong’s in­ter­na­tional ta­lent pool be­yond the fi­nan­cial ser­vices field.</p>
    <p>On the po­lit­i­cal front, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Sing Ming from The Hong Kong Univer­sity of Science and Tech­nol­ogy said “Bei­jing would like to ex­ert greater con­trol over Hong Kong, es­pe­cially the younger gen­er­a­tion who are will­ing to work in the Greater Bay Area”.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam said even­tual in­te­gra­tion with the main­land, a long­stand­ing pol­icy, had been ex­pe­dited and would hap­pen well be­fore 2047 when the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” prin­ci­ple en­shrined in the han­dover agree­ment, which guar­an­tees a high de­gree of free­doms for Hong Kong, is due to ex­pire.</p>
    <p>“If you count the 50 years of ‘no change’ prom­ise made by China, I think in­te­gra­tion will take place in the 2030s,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Sing noted that the “‘two sys­tems’ seem to have been for­got­ten”.</p>
    <p>“Only ‘one coun­try’ is un­der­scored again and again so that will leave an im­pres­sion that she (Mrs Lam) is en­tirely a pup­pet for Bei­jing,” he said, adding that this did not bode well for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity’s al­ready frag­ile con­fi­dence in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal watch­ers say, based on the tra­jec­tory, judges could be next in the govern­ment’s sights as it moves to strengthen the al­le­giance of pub­lic ser­vants and teach­ers.</p>
    <p>“It will be dif­fi­cult but I think they are mov­ing in that di­rec­tion,” said Dr Lam, who noted that the in­de­pen­dence of the ju­di­ciary is deeply in­grained in Hong Kong, and is con­sid­ered to be one of the key pil­lars of the city’s suc­cess story.</p>
    <p>What­ever the case, the long-time China ob­server be­lieves Hong Kong could still re­tain some dis­tinct fea­tures of the ex­ist­ing sys­tem, such as im­por­tant el­e­ments of the Bri­tish le­gal sys­tem and the free­dom of cap­i­tal move­ment, even if this was “an at­ten­u­ated” ver­sion.</p>
