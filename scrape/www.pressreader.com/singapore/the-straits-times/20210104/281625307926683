    <p>Con­cerns about the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion to pas­sen­gers by the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) ste­ward who worked as a part-time Grab driver are valid, but mask wear­ing and other pre­cau­tions taken, as well as the ro­bust con­tact trac­ing sys­tem here, will mit­i­gate the like­li­hood of a clus­ter form­ing.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, said that while there is in­deed a higher risk of in­fec­tion for pas­sen­gers picked up by the in­fected Grab driver, con­tact trac­ing and iso­lat­ing those ex­posed will limit any virus spread.</p>
    <p>“There will al­ways be such in­ci­dents crop­ping up in fu­ture, and that is ex­actly why ev­ery­one in the com­mu­nity needs to re­main vig­i­lant and our test­ing and con­tact trac­ing ef­forts can­not cease,” he noted.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old ste­ward was detected through proac­tive test­ing ar­ranged by the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) for air crew who had re­turned from overseas flights. He had trav­elled to the United States for work from Dec 12 to Dec 16. Af­ter his re­turn, he worked part-time as a Grab driver from Dec 17 to 24.</p>
    <p>The man was tested on Dec 23 and re­sults came back in­con­clu­sive on Dec 25. A sec­ond test on Dec 25 was also in­con­clu­sive. He re­mained at home un­til Dec 27, when he was con­firmed to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health said last Wednesday that pas­sen­gers who took the Grab ride are be­ing tracked down through con­tact trac­ing. It added that any pas­sen­ger deemed to be a close con­tact of the man will have to be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said: “It’s hard to imag­ine a worse pos­si­ble sit­u­a­tion than hav­ing some­one po­ten­tially ex­posed to viruses overseas be­ing able to by­pass quar­an­tine, and com­ing into con­tact with a large num­ber of peo­ple in a closed en­vi­ron­ment like a pri­vate-hire car.”</p>
    <p>But he noted that Grab had put in place pre­cau­tions like mask wear­ing and bar­ring pas­sen­gers from sit­ting in the front seat.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook said the firm can also iden­tify pas­sen­gers who rode in the par­tic­u­lar ve­hi­cle dur­ing that week.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo added that while there is a small risk of a com­mu­nity clus­ter de­vel­op­ing, if a pas­sen­ger is in­fected and spreads the virus to oth­ers in his or her so­cial net­work, con­tact trac­ing will be able to iden­tify the rest and they will be iso­lated as well.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious diseases ex­pert at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hospi­tal, called for more mea­sures to be in­tro­duced for air crew, ei­ther by im­ple­ment­ing a 14-day stay-home no­tice pe­riod, though it would im­pair the air­line’s abil­ity to func­tion; more fre­quent Covid-19 test­ing; or manda­tory vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The CAAS had an­nounced last Wednesday that it was tight­en­ing safety mea­sures af­ter two SIA per­son­nel – a pi­lot and the ste­ward who worked as a part-time Grab driver – tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Air­line crew here had been ex­empt from stay-home no­tice since March, pro­vided pre­cau­tions were taken to min­imise their risk of ex­po­sure to the virus.</p>
    <p>The CAAS also said those who have lay­overs in high-risk desti­na­tions will be re­quired to un­dergo poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests on ar­rival, and on the third and sev­enth day fol­low­ing their re­turn to Sin­ga­pore. They must self­iso­late un­til they re­ceive a neg­a­tive re­sult from their sev­enth-day PCR test.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, air crew on lay­overs will be re­quired to fur­ther min­imise their con­tact with lo­cals. For ex­am­ple, food de­liv­ered through room ser­vice should be left out­side the room at the door.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, Grab said the SIA ste­ward who worked as a part­time driver had been tem­po­rar­ily sus­pended from its plat­form as a safety pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>VIG­I­LANCE CRIT­I­CAL</p>
    <p>There will al­ways be such in­ci­dents crop­ping up in fu­ture, and that is ex­actly why ev­ery­one in the com­mu­nity needs to re­main vig­i­lant and our test­ing and con­tact trac­ing ef­forts can­not cease.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR TEO YIK YING, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, on the case of the in­fected part-time Grab driver.</p>
    <p>The last-grasp ef­forts this week by Mr Don­ald Trump to over­ride the will of the Amer­i­can peo­ple and have him de­clared pres­i­dent will come to naught, but could un­wit­tingly lay the ground­work for a new era of bi­par­ti­san­ship.</p>
    <p>On Wednesday, Congress meets to val­i­date the re­sults of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Or­di­nar­ily, it is a for­mal­ity – af­ter the elec­toral votes of each state are re­viewed by mem­bers of Congress, the vice-pres­i­dent would then de­clare the win­ner of the elec­tion to be sworn in on Jan 20 as the next pres­i­dent of the United States.</p>
    <p>That won’t be the case this time. In­stead of fi­nally ac­cept­ing de­feat, Mr Trump wants Repub­li­cans in Congress to re­ject the re­sults of the Elec­toral Col­lege and de­clare him the win­ner.</p>
    <p>Like his other post-elec­tion mis­steps, this ef­fort will fail. This time, how­ever, he may in­ad­ver­tently cre­ate some­thing sorely needed but de­press­ingly lack­ing in Wash­ing­ton – a spirit of bi­par­ti­san­ship.</p>
    <p>Last year, the na­tion wit­nessed its worst health­care cri­sis in a cen­tury, its worst eco­nomic cri­sis in eight decades and the great­est civil un­rest in more than 50 years, yet a di­vided Congress came to­gether to pass only the bare min­i­mum needed to pro­tect the coun­try’s econ­omy and cit­i­zens’ health.</p>
    <p>Now, af­ter fail­ing to over­turn the elec­tion re­sults in the courts – some 60 chal­lenges hav­ing failed at state and fed­eral lev­els – Mr Trump is push­ing to get Repub­li­cans in both Houses of Congress to back him in his last-ditch at­tempt to stay in power.</p>
    <p>Given that the Democrats have a ma­jor­ity in the House and both it and the Se­nate would need to vote to keep Mr Trump as pres­i­dent, this tac­tic will fail. But the real story for Amer­i­can democ­racy will be whether Repub­li­can sen­a­tors stand with the Con­sti­tu­tion or with sedi­tion.</p>
    <p>Lat­est in­di­ca­tions are that Mr Trump’s des­per­ate ma­noeu­vre will back­fire with many Repub­li­cans and push some of them to vote with Democrats, un­der­min­ing his hold over the party.</p>
    <p>To be sure, a dozen or so House Repub­li­cans have in­di­cated they will ob­ject to Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory, with one mem­ber pre­dict­ing more than 100 of the 195 House Repub­li­cans will file ob­jec­tions to the elec­tion re­sults. Given how con­ser­va­tive many of their dis­tricts have be­come, with their Rep­re­sen­ta­tives ei­ther be­ing true be­liev­ers in Mr Trump and his false state­ments or, if not, fear­ing the like­li­hood of be­ing chal­lenged from the right in their next pri­mary if they do not ob­ject, this is not a shock­ing prog­nos­ti­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Still, with 233 House Democrats, even all Repub­li­cans vot­ing with Mr Trump will fail to over­turn Mr Bi­den’s Elec­toral Col­lege vic­tory. While not ideal, the House can op­er­ate without bi­par­ti­san­ship as the in­sti­tu­tion re­quires only a sim­ple ma­jor­ity to pass leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>THE SE­NATE BAT­TLE</p>
    <p>In the Se­nate, where the Repub­li­cans now have a ma­jor­ity, its leader Mitch McCon­nell strongly op­poses any such ob­jec­tion, know­ing nu­mer­ous Repub­li­cans will vote against the Pres­i­dent, re­sult­ing in a dam­ag­ing split in the ranks, but a devel­op­ment that could set the stage for fu­ture bi­par­ti­san agree­ments. He has called his vote to cer­tify “the most con­se­quen­tial” he has cast in his 36 years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Right now, Mr Trump has only about 20 per cent of the Repub­li­can sen­a­tors po­ten­tially with him to ques­tion Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory, whereas all but Mr Mitt Rom­ney voted him not guilty in his im­peach­ment trial early last year. Nei­ther Mr McCon­nell nor Mr Trump has the up­per hand in dic­tat­ing votes.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally hav­ing an iron grasp on his party, Mr McCon­nell does not in this in­stance. This could be the be­gin­ning of sen­a­tors be­com­ing more in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>BREAK­ING WITH TRUMP</p>
    <p>What is set to hap­pen on Wednesday is that Repub­li­can sen­a­tors must vote on the record for or against the Pres­i­dent, know­ing that such a vote ei­ther way harms them po­lit­i­cally. It will be a clar­i­fy­ing mo­ment in the de­bate on where the party stands in its re­la­tion­ship with Mr Trump, with a split ver­dict com­ing of those who back him without ques­tion and oth­ers who want to move for­ward.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, in forc­ing Repub­li­cans to fi­nally take him head-on in pro­tect­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion just might give rise to a new era of bi­par­ti­san­ship, if the Democrats first pur­sue pol­icy goals which have the great­est cross­over ap­peal.</p>
    <p>For Repub­li­cans break­ing with Mr Trump this week, it would not be their first act of re­bel­lion. Many had done so last Fri­day in over­rid­ing his veto of the US$740 bil­lion (S$978 bil­lion) Depart­ment of De­fence fund­ing Bill. The re­sound­ing 81-13 bi­par­ti­san vote re­flected anger among mem­bers of Congress who had worked hard across the aisle to put to­gether the pack­age and in­sti­tu­tional pride in hav­ing suc­cess­fully passed the de­fence Bill each year for 60 years.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond re­jec­tion by Repub­li­cans, this time of Mr Trump’s power grab, will not im­me­di­ately change the dy­nam­ics of Amer­i­can pol­i­tics. Af­ter the vote, the US will look just as dys­func­tional this year as it did last year and the prob­lems to be tack­led re­main as mas­sive as ever, but the out­come could pave the way for more bi­par­ti­san votes, mak­ing it eas­ier for the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to gov­ern.</p>
    <p>Even if the Democrats were to ob­tain the Se­nate ma­jor­ity with two vic­to­ries in Ge­or­gia to­mor­row, last­ing progress comes only from Congress with bi­par­ti­san leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This year, without Mr Trump in the White House, both par­ties can find ways within their re­spec­tive ide­o­log­i­cal frame­works of agree­ing on how to “Build Back Bet­ter”, a key com­po­nent of the Bi­den cam­paign.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, bi­par­ti­san agree­ment ex­ists in Wash­ing­ton on other is­sues such as the need to deal more ef­fec­tively with China and Rus­sia, and pro­vide more pre­dictable Covid-19 re­lief.</p>
    <p>Democrats again in the White House but stuck fight­ing the Repub­li­cans con­stantly would be even more detri­men­tal this time for the coun­try than dur­ing the Obama years. The stakes are sim­ply too high.</p>
    <p>TRUMP’S FU­TURE</p>
    <p>As for Mr Trump’s grip on his party, a bi­par­ti­san vote con­firm­ing Mr Bi­den’s elec­tion will weaken it. Mr Trump will not go away qui­etly. For his last two weeks in of­fice, he will likely urge on protests against his de­feat and even threaten to bring out the mil­i­tary to stay in power, but all this should and will fail.</p>
    <p>Be­yond his time in of­fice, need­ing to gen­er­ate in­come to pay astro­nom­i­cal le­gal fees as well as his debts, ex­pect ral­lies and other ef­forts by Mr Trump once he leaves of­fice to stir up his fol­low­ers that can po­ten­tially be mon­e­tised, and which will have the ef­fect of main­tain­ing the il­lu­sion of power.</p>
    <p>But the com­ing flood of rev­e­la­tions of his re­cent be­hav­iour, cour­tesy of var­i­ous in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and, bet­ter yet, tell-all books from his in­ner cir­cle, will take their toll.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump won’t fade as badly as Ms Sarah Palin, the con­tro­ver­sial Repub­li­can vice-pres­i­dent nom­i­nee in 2008, and while doubt­ful he will be so des­per­ate as to show up on Danc­ing With The Stars, his po­lit­i­cal vi­a­bil­ity could fol­low a sim­i­lar down­ward trajectory.</p>
    <p>It won’t be pretty, and could be down­right ugly, but his de­par­ture from Wash­ing­ton, as the two par­ties work to­gether to en­sure his right­ful exit, will has­ten his post-pres­i­dency ir­rel­e­vance. In do­ing so, Mr Trump just could be set­ting the stage for some­thing he failed at ut­terly in his years in the White House – let­ting Amer­ica work on be­ing great.</p>
    <p>Steven R. Okun and Thur­good Mar­shall Jr served in the Clin­ton ad­min­is­tra­tion as deputy gen­eral coun­sel of the Depart­ment of Trans­porta­tion and White House Cab­i­net sec­re­tary, re­spec­tively. Mr Okun is se­nior ad­viser for global strate­gic con­sul­tancy McLarty As­so­ciates and is also a gov­er­nor of the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Sin­ga­pore. Mr Mar­shall prac­tises law in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
