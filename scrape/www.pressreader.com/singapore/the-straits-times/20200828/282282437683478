    <p>NEW YORK • Three of the world’s rich­est peo­ple have achieved stag­ger­ing new lev­els of per­sonal wealth.</p>
    <p>The net worth of Ama­zon.com founder Jeff Be­zos eclipsed US$200 bil­lion (S$273 bil­lion) on Wed­nes­day as shares of the e-com­merce gi­ant climbed to a record. Forbes said it made the 56-year-old the world’s first-ever per­son to amass such a for­tune.</p>
    <p>The move si­mul­ta­ne­ously pushed his for­mer wife MacKen­zie Scott, 50, to the brink of be­com­ing the world’s rich­est woman, just be­hind L’Oreal heiress Fran­coise Bet­ten­court Mey­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Elon Musk, mean­while, ex­tended an ex­tra­or­di­nary stretch of wealth gains to be­come a cen­tibil­lion­aire. Tesla shares ral­lied on Wed­nes­day, push­ing his net worth to US$101 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex, a list­ing of the world’s 500 rich­est peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Tech com­pa­nies boosted the S&P 500 and Nas­daq Com­pos­ite i ndexes to new highs for a fourth straight day, buoyed by news that the Fed­eral Re­serve is likely to keep short-term in­ter­est rates near zero for at least five years.</p>
    <p>The gains by Mr Be­zos and Mr Musk rep­re­sent just the lat­est high­wa­ter mark for wealth ac­cu­mu­la­tion in a topsy-turvy year de­fined by both surg­ing mar­kets and cat­a­strophic hu­man and economic loss.</p>
    <p>The world’s 500 rich­est peo­ple have gained US$809 bil­lion so far this year, a 14 per cent in­crease since Jan­u­ary, even as the global coro­n­avirus pan­demic caused a record drop in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and mil­lions of lost jobs.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing in­come in­equal­ity has pro­voked sharp re­sponses from many pro­gres­sive politi­cians and crit­ics on the left. United States Sen­a­tor Bernie San­ders ear­lier this month in­tro­duced leg­is­la­tion to tax “ex­treme” wealth gains dur­ing the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We can­not con­tinue to al­low bil­lion­aires like Jeff Be­zos and Elon Musk to be­come ob­scenely rich while mil­lions of Amer­i­cans face evic­tion, hunger and economic des­per­a­tion,” Mr San­ders said on Wed­nes­day in a state­ment. “It’s time to fun­da­men­tally change our na­tional pri­or­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers view their mas­sive wealth as jus­ti­fied, say­ing they have earned it through the cre­ation of sin­gu­lar busi­nesses. “When you look at Musk and Be­zos, it’s un­der­stated to say that in their own ways, they’ve changed the world,” said Mr Thomas Hayes, chair­man of Great Hill Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The surge in wealth is es­pe­cially con­cen­trated in the up­per ranks of the bil­lion­aire in­dex and has been fu­elled largely by tech stocks, which have been on a tear as the pan­demic drives more peo­ple on­line. That also in­cludes a rise in the num­ber of re­tail in­vestors buy­ing stocks.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk, 49, now one of four cen­tibil­lion­aires in the world, has seen his for­tune grow by US$73.6 bil­lion this year, a jump still smaller than Mr Be­zos’, who is up by US$87.1 bil­lion. The net worth of Face­book’s Mr Mark Zucker­berg topped US$100 bil­lion ear­lier this month. On Wed­nes­day alone, it rose by US$8.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>US tech ty­coons have not been the only ben­e­fi­cia­ries. In­dia’s Mr Mukesh Am­bani be­came the first Asian to rank among the world’s five rich­est last month.</p>
    <p>He has gained US$22.5 bil­lion this year on the back of a boost in shares of his con­glom­er­ate Re­liance In­dus­tries, whose tech di­vi­sion has at­tracted re­cent in­vest­ments from the likes of Face­book and Sil­ver Lake.</p>
    <p>And de­spite grow­ing ten­sions with the US, China’s tech bil­lion­aires have gained this year too.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent Hold­ings chief ex­ec­u­tive Pony Ma has amassed US$16.6 bil­lion this year and is now worth US$55.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Alibaba Group Hold­ing’s Mr Jack Ma and Mr Wil­liam Ding of NetEase have also added more than US$12 bil­lion each, putting their for­tunes at US$58.9 bil­lion and US$30.8 bil­lion, re­spec­tively.</p>
