    <p>WASH­ING­TON • He has chan­nelled per­sonal tragedy into a heart-on­his-sleeve com­pas­sion for ev­ery­day Amer­i­cans, but Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den faces the chal­lenge of a life­time as he in­her­its a na­tion both trau­ma­tised and spell­bound by his White House pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory – pro­jected by TV net­works yes­ter­day in a cliffhange­r elec­tion with the United States in cri­sis – turns the page on Mr Don­ald Trump’s most di­vi­sive of pres­i­den­cies, and re­wards his ap­peal to the bet­ter an­gels of a deeply riven coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den ran for the White House twice be­fore, in 1987 and 2008.</p>
    <p>A loss to the deeply po­lar­is­ing Mr Trump – Mr Bi­den said in the elec­tion’s fi­nal stretch – would mean he had been a “lousy” can­di­date, low­er­ing the cur­tain on a pro­lific but ul­ti­mately un­ful­filled po­lit­i­cal ca­reer.</p>
    <p>But “Mid­dle Class Joe” had made it his life’s crown­ing mis­sion to un­seat the Repub­li­can and, in his words, re­store the “soul” of Amer­ica. And de­spite a cam­paign muted be­yond recog­ni­tion by Covid-19 – con­ducted largely from home while his high-oc­tane ri­val charged around the coun­try – Mr Bi­den ul­ti­mately showed Mr Trump the door.</p>
    <p>When he takes the oath of of­fice on Jan 20, at age 78, Mr Bi­den will be the old­est US head of state ever in­au­gu­rated.</p>
    <p>He hit the na­tional stage at just 29, with a sur­prise US Se­nate win in Delaware in 1972.</p>
    <p>One month later, tragedy struck: His wife Neilia and their one-yearold daugh­ter Naomi were killed in a car crash as they were out Christ­mas shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s two sons were se­verely in­jured but sur­vived, only for the el­dest, Beau, to suc­cumb to can­cer four decades later, in 2015.</p>
    <p>Through­out his life, Mr Bi­den has spo­ken poignantly of his per­sonal en­coun­ters with tragedy, seen as hav­ing nour­ished a ca­pac­ity for gen­uine em­pa­thy – some­thing Mr Trump failed to demon­strate even as the toll from Covid-19 climbed to­wards a quar­ter-mil­lion.</p>
    <p>His re­tail pol­i­tick­ing skills are peer­less: He can flash his mil­lion­watt smile at col­lege stu­dents, com­mis­er­ate with un­em­ployed Rust Belt ma­chin­ists, or de­liver a fiery ad­mon­ish­ment of ri­vals.</p>
    <p>That per­son­able, gre­gar­i­ous qual­ity was cur­tailed by the pan­demic, which brought in-per­son cam­paign­ing to a halt in March and prompted a more cau­tious Bi­den on the trail.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect was any­thing but as­sured of be­com­ing his party’s flag bearer. De­spite be­ing the favourite of the Demo­cratic es­tab­lish­ment, he was deemed by some to be too old or too cen­trist.</p>
    <p>His cam­paign looked headed for dis­as­ter after dis­ap­point­ing pri­mary losses to the fiery Bernie San­ders early this year.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den came roar­ing back in South Carolina’s pri­mary on the strength of over­whelm­ing back­ing from African-Amer­i­can vot­ers, a cru­cial base of Demo­cratic sup­port.</p>
    <p>Clinch­ing the nom­i­na­tion marked a sharp con­trast to his 1988 flame­out, when he quit in dis­grace after be­ing caught pla­gia­ris­ing a speech by Bri­tish politi­cian Neil Kin­nock.</p>
    <p>In 2008, he hardly fared bet­ter, drop­ping out after mus­ter­ing less than 1 per cent of the vote in Iowa’s cau­cuses. That year, he was ul­ti­mately picked as run­ning mate by Mr Barack Obama, who dubbed him “Amer­ica’s happy war­rior”.</p>
    <p>Nearly ev­ery Sun­day Mr Bi­den prays at St Joseph on the Brandy­wine, a Catholic church in his af­flu­ent Wilm­ing­ton neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>There in the ceme­tery rest his par­ents, his first wife and daugh­ter – and his son Beau, un­der a tomb­stone dec­o­rated with small Amer­i­can flags.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Mr Bi­den con­fided about Beau and his un­de­ni­able in­flu­ence: “Ev­ery morn­ing I get up... and I think to my­self, ‘Is he proud of me?’ ”</p>
