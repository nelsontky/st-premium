    <p>BEI­JING • China’s drug reg­u­la­tor has ap­proved the coun­try’s first coro­n­avirus vac­cine for gen­eral pub­lic use, a sign of con­fi­dence in the ex­per­i­men­tal shots the na­tion plans to roll out within and beyond its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>China’s Na­tional Med­i­cal Prod­ucts Ad­min­is­tra­tion gave the autho­ri­sa­tion to a Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by state-owned China Na­tional Biotec Group (CNBG), a unit of Sinopharm, of­fi­cials told re­porters in Bei­jing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With the ap­proval, the vac­cine – which has been au­tho­rised for emer­gency use in China since mid-last year along with other front-run­ner shots – will be made com­mer­cially avail­able, mean­ing it can be ad­min­is­tered to the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors from the United States to Sin­ga­pore have ap­proved shots over the past month, among them vac­cines de­vel­oped by Pfizer, Moderna and As­traZeneca, but those have been largely for emer­gency use, a sta­tus China granted to its de­vel­op­ers months ago.</p>
    <p>China will tar­get mem­bers of the pop­u­la­tion at higher risk in its in­oc­u­la­tions, among them the el­derly and those with pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions, and then roll vac­cines out to the gen­eral pub­lic, Mr Zeng Yixin, Vice-Min­is­ter of the coun­try’s Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion, said at the brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has al­ready ad­min­is­tered more than 4.5 mil­lion doses of the Covid-19 vac­cine, with three mil­lion alone given since mid-De­cem­ber, Mr Zeng said. It is said to be aim­ing to in­oc­u­late 50 mil­lion peo­ple against the virus by early Fe­bru­ary, ahead of the an­nual Chi­nese New Year hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>The go-ahead for broader use un­der­scores China’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to be a ma­jor player in sup­ply­ing vac­ci­na­tions to its own peo­ple and coun­tries around the world. Yet, the na­tion faces chal­lenges in win­ning over the trust of mil­lions of peo­ple who may have to rely on its vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese de­vel­op­ers have been slow com­pared with their West­ern peers in re­leas­ing clin­i­cal trial data, rais­ing ques­tions over trans­parency, ef­fi­cacy and safety as the world puts a laser fo­cus on which vac­cines will be most suc­cess­ful in fight­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>CNBG said on Wed­nes­day that its shot is ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19 in 79.3 per cent of peo­ple, less than the 86 per cent re­ported ear­lier from its tri­als in the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>CNBG will pub­lish de­tailed data about its shots in recog­nised in­ter­na­tional med­i­cal jour­nals, its pres­i­dent Wu Yonglin said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>China now has 14 vac­cines, in­clud­ing Si­no­vac’s Coron­aVac and CanSino Bi­o­log­ics’ Con­vide­cia, in clin­i­cal tri­als. Five of them are in last-stage phase 3 tri­als.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China on Wed­nes­day con­firmed its first case of a new coro­n­avirus vari­ant re­cently de­tected in Bri­tain. The pa­tient is a 23-year-old woman from Shang­hai who ar­rived from Bri­tain on Dec 14.</p>
