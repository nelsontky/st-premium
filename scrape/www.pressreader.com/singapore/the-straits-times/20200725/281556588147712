    <p>United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has called on Chi­nese peo­ple and “free na­tions of the world” to change the be­hav­iour of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP). The CCP now poses the pri­mary chal­lenge to the world’s lib­erty, Mr Pom­peo said on Thurs­day, as he urged coun­tries to stand up to­gether to China and “draw com­mon lines in the sand”.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, in a ma­jor pol­icy speech, has called on Chi­nese peo­ple and “free na­tions of the world” to change the be­hav­iour of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP).</p>
    <p>The CCP now poses the pri­mary chal­lenge to the world’s lib­erty, Mr Pom­peo said on Thurs­day, as he urged coun­tries to stand up to­gether to China and “draw com­mon lines in the sand”.</p>
    <p>“The free world must tri­umph over this new tyranny,” he said. “If the free world doesn’t change Com­mu­nist China, Com­mu­nist China will surely change us.”</p>
    <p>His ad­dress capped a se­ries of speeches on the im­bal­ances in Amer­ica’s re­la­tion­ship with China, from eco­nom­ics to es­pi­onage, by top US of­fi­cials in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>It was one of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s most sweep­ing in­dict­ments of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, and one of its strong­est ap­peals to coun­tries to j oin Wash­ing­ton in coun­ter­ing Chi­nese be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo called for “a new al­liance of democ­ra­cies”, as he high­lighted how the US had re­jected China’s un­law­ful claims i n the South China Sea and urged coun­tries to keep Chi­nese equip­ment from their 5G net­works out of se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“I call on every leader of every na­tion to start by do­ing what Amer­ica has done – to sim­ply in­sist on rec­i­proc­ity, trans­parency, and ac­count­abil­ity from the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party,” said Mr Pom­peo at the</p>
    <p>Richard Nixon Pres­i­den­tial Li­brary in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The venue was a call­back to the 37th US pres­i­dent, whose visit to China in 1972 paved the way for the es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s al­most 50 years of engagement with China had not brought the kind of change in China that it hoped for, said Mr Pom­peo.</p>
    <p>To­day’s China is in­creas­ingly author­i­tar­ian at home and more ag­gres­sive in its hos­til­ity to free­dom abroad, he said, ac­cus­ing China of steal­ing US trade se­crets and mak­ing the world’s key wa­ter­ways less safe for in­ter­na­tional com­merce.</p>
    <p>And be­cause the CCP ped­dled empty prom­ises, Wash­ing­ton would keep talk­ing to Bei­jing, but on the ba­sis of “dis­trust and ver­ify”, said Mr Pom­peo.</p>
    <p>The speech cast the con­flict in par­tially ide­o­log­i­cal terms, draw­ing par­al­lels be­tween Com­mu­nist China and the Soviet Union, Amer­ica’s old Cold War ad­ver­sary. Mr Pom­peo called Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping “a true be­liever in a bank­rupt to­tal­i­tar­ian ide­ol­ogy”, whose goal was “global hege­mony built on Chi­nese Com­mu­nism”.</p>
    <p>In a post-speech dis­cus­sion, Mr Pom­peo ac­knowl­edged he was ask­ing coun­tries to pick a side, but said those which stood up to China could rely on Amer­ica to be there for them. “I think about pick­ing a side dif­fer­ently than pick­ing Amer­ica or pick­ing China. The divi­sion... is be­tween free­dom and tyranny. That’s the de­ci­sion we’re ask­ing each of these na­tions to make.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts from the Eura­sia Group con­sul­tancy said the speech sig­nalled a sharp­en­ing ide­o­log­i­cal con­flict, al­though the speech it­self would have lit­tle im­me­di­ate im­pact on the al­ready-frayed US-China re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing has al­ready con­cluded that the US un­der (Pres­i­dent Don­ald) Trump is out to con­tain China, but with a US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion loom­ing is not in­clined to take dras­tic pol­icy ac­tions be­yond pro­por­tional re­sponses to US provo­ca­tion,” they wrote in a re­search note.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said Mr Pom­peo’s speech ap­peared to be a bid to cast him­self as the 21st-cen­tury ver­sion of US diplo­mat John Fos­ter Dulles, the Cold War-era sec­re­tary of state known for his ag­gres­sive anti-com­mu­nism stance.</p>
    <p>“What he is do­ing is as fu­tile as an ant try­ing to shake a tree,” she said on Twit­ter. “It’s about time that all peace-loving peo­ple around the world stepped for­ward to pre­vent him from do­ing the world more harm,” she added.</p>
    <p>Other an­a­lysts lamented that the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s valid con­cerns about the CCP’s be­hav­iour were clouded by elec­tion­eer­ing and un­der­mined by dys­func­tion at home.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts also said US ef­forts to rally a coali­tion to counter China were ham­pered by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s treat­ment of al­lies, and that its ap­peals to the Chi­nese peo­ple fell flat given re­cent visa ac­tions that tar­geted them.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­pos­si­ble to over­look the per­verse po­lit­i­cal in­cen­tives in play, such that the blam­ing of a for­eign other and pro­mul­ga­tion of xeno­pho­bia gain more trac­tion than crit­i­cal ef­forts to re­solve ur­gent prob­lems at home,” said ad­junct se­nior fel­low Elsa Ka­nia of the Cen­tre for a New Amer­i­can Se­cu­rity. “These delu­sions of grand strat­egy are empty and hol­low, par­tic­u­larly at a time when Amer­i­can cred­i­bil­ity is so ter­ri­bly dam­aged by the degra­da­tion of our val­ues and found­ing prin­ci­ples,” she added.</p>
    <p>PLAY FOR LOY­ALTY</p>
    <p>I think about pick­ing a side dif­fer­ently than pick­ing Amer­ica or pick­ing China. The divi­sion... is be­tween free­dom and tyranny. That’s the de­ci­sion we’re ask­ing each of these ’’ na­tions to make.</p>
    <p>U.S. SEC­RE­TARY OF STATE MIKE POM­PEO, who ac­knowl­edged that he was ask­ing coun­tries to pick a side.</p>
