    <p>Be­lieve it or not, any­one can sing.</p>
    <p>More specif­i­cally, any­one can ben­e­fit from singing, re­gard­less of age or de­mo­graphic, say ex­perts. There are many phys­i­o­log­i­cal, psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Singing can be an ex­cel­lent form of ex­er­cise, says mu­sic ther­a­pist Grace Low from the Mu­sic & Cre­ative Ther­apy unit at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“Even if you are healthy, your body will get a work­out when you em­ploy proper singing tech­niques by ac­ti­vat­ing your di­aphragm. It helps you build a stronger di­aphragm and be more aware of your body’s breath­ing process,” she says.</p>
    <p>The psy­cho­log­i­cal and emo­tional ben­e­fits are also im­mense.</p>
    <p>She adds: “It is a nat­u­ral an­tide­pres­sant. It de­creases the lev­els of stress hor­mones in your body and can take your mind off the day’s trou­bles to boost your mood.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion for Mu­sic Ther­apy Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Calvin Eng, 28, says the as­so­ci­a­tion has re­ceived more in­quiries on mu­sic ther­apy dur­ing the cur­rent coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Specif­i­cally, on how mu­sic might be able to sup­port our men­tal well-be­ing,” says Mr Eng, a board cer­ti­fied mu­sic ther­a­pist.</p>
    <p>“Singing al­lows us to ex­press our­selves and our feel­ings, re­lieve stress and feel bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>It in­creases oxy­gen level and re­leases en­dor­phins that make us feel good and re­laxed, he adds.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts agree that be­yond the ac­tual singing, the so­cial na­ture of singing in a group or choir has added ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Be it choral singing or karaoke with friends, singers in a group may ex­pe­ri­ence a sense of be­long­ing and co­he­sive­ness, says Ms Low.</p>
    <p>“Stud­ies have shown that it helps to in­crease so­cial bond­ing, which leads to an in­crease of hu­man so­cial be­hav­iours like laugh­ter.”</p>
    <p>Mr Eng says that singing in a choir sup­ports our well-be­ing by pro­mot­ing so­cial con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Mu­sic has been a nat­u­ral rea­son for peo­ple to gather since early cul­tures. A 2011 study on 16 adult out­pa­tients with chronic men­tal dis­or­ders noted that mem­ber­ship and par­tic­i­pa­tion in a choir may pro­mote cre­ative op­por­tu­ni­ties for per­sonal growth and es­tab­lish reg­u­lar so­cial habits,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“When we gather and do things to­gether in syn­chro­ni­sa­tion, whether in rhythm or voice, the com­mu­nica­tive power is much greater than when one does it solo.”</p>
    <p>In stress­ful times, mu­sic-mak­ing as self-care may be an op­tion to con­sider.</p>
    <p>In­deed, one of the many ways is to sing, says Ms Low. “It helps re­duce stress and anx­i­ety that in turn im­proves our sleep qual­ity and mood.”</p>
    <p>Reap­ing the ben­e­fits of mu­sic can also be as sim­ple as shar­ing a song with your loved one that re­minds you of them, says Mr Eng.</p>
    <p>“You could even get on a video call and sing to­gether – no one ex­pects you to sing (well), just en­joy and sing away.”</p>
    <p>But be sure to lis­ten to your needs and par­tic­i­pate “in your own time”, he ad­vises.</p>
    <p>“Whether it is singing, learning a new in­stru­ment, or be­ing part of a mu­sic ex­pe­ri­ence, it is im­por­tant to give space and al­low an in­di­vid­ual to join the process when he or she is ready.”</p>
