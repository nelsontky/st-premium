    <p>A study has found that three mea­sures, when ap­plied to­gether, have more than dou­bled the like­li­hood of by­standers per­form­ing car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion (CPR) on car­diac ar­rest vic­tims in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dis­patch-as­sisted CPR, CPR and au­to­mated ex­ter­nal de­fib­ril­la­tor train­ing, and the myRe­spon­der app were found to have raised the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force’s re­sponses of by­standers giv­ing life­sav­ing as­sis­tance to heart at­tack vic­tims be­fore paramedics at­tended to them.</p>
    <p>Dis­patch-as­sisted CPR refers to CPR that is ad­min­is­tered un­der the guid­ance of a first re­spon­der, such as a para­medic who may, through a phone call, as­sess the sit­u­a­tion and give in­struc­tions to a by­stander who then per­forms CPR.</p>
    <p>The study was con­ducted by re­searchers at the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, Duke Univer­sity, and sev­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions here, and pub­lished last month.</p>
    <p>“Our find­ings clearly showed that a bun­dled, na­tional, by­stander-fo­cused pub­lic health in­ter­ven­tion in­creased the chances of laypeo­ple per­form­ing by­stander CPR,” said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Au­drey L. Blewer, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist and re­sus­ci­ta­tion sci­en­tist in the Depart­ment of Fam­ily Medicine and Com­mu­nity Health at Duke Univer­sity School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>Data from by­stander in­ter­ven­tion pro­grammes be­tween 2011 and 2016 was used in the study, which found that the prob­a­bil­ity of vic­tims re­ceiv­ing by­stander CPR in­creased with each added in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>When all three in­ter­ven­tions were ap­plied, the like­li­hood of by­stander CPR be­ing per­formed in­creased nearly eight times com­pared with no in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>The like­li­hood of a vic­tim’s sur­vival also i ncreased more than three-fold, com­pared with no in­ter­ven­tion, when all three aids were adopted.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Mar­cus Ong, se­nior author of the study and direc­tor of the Health Ser­vices and Sys­tems Re­search Pro­gramme at Duke-NUS, said: “Un­der­stand­ing the im­pact of pub­lic health in­ter­ven­tions helps inform strate­gies to i ncrease by­stander CPR and tar­geted ini­tia­tives to im­prove sur­vival from outof-hos­pi­tal car­diac ar­rests.</p>
    <p>“Stud­ies like this al­low us to en­hance our pub­lic health sys­tems and save more lives in the process.”</p>
