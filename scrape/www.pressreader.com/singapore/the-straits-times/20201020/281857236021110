    <p>PARIS • French po­lice yes­ter­day raided Is­lamic as­so­ci­a­tions and groups of for­eign­ers sus­pected of ex­trem­ist reli­gious beliefs, sources said, three days af­ter a sus­pected Is­lamist be­headed a school teacher.</p>
    <p>His­tory teacher Sa­muel Paty, 47, was mur­dered last Fri­day in broad day­light out­side his school in a mid­dle-class Paris sub­urb by an 18-year-old of Chechen ori­gin.</p>
    <p>Po­lice shot the at­tacker dead. The teenage as­sas­sin sought to avenge his vic­tim’s use of car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Mo­ham­mad in a class on free­dom of ex­pres­sion to 13-year-olds.</p>
    <p>Mus­lims be­lieve any de­pic­tion of the Prophet is blas­phe­mous.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic fig­ures have called the killing an at­tack on the Repub­lic and on French val­ues.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin said there were some 80 in­ves­ti­ga­tions be­ing con­ducted into on­line hate and that he was look­ing into whether to dis­band about 50 as­so­ci­a­tions within the Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Po­lice op­er­a­tions have taken place and more will fol­low, con­cern­ing tens of in­di­vid­u­als,” the min­is­ter told Europe 1.</p>
    <p>A po­lice source on Sun­day said France was prepar­ing to de­port 213 for­eign­ers who were on a gov­ern­ment watch list and sus­pected of hold­ing ex­treme reli­gious beliefs.</p>
    <p>About 150 of the 213 are serv­ing jail sen­tences. The de­por­ta­tions were al­ready be­ing worked on be­fore Fri­day’s at­tack, a se­cu­rity source said.</p>
    <p>Po­lice de­tained 10 people in con­nec­tion with the at­tack in the 24 hours fol­low­ing Mr Paty’s killing.</p>
    <p>Among them, prose­cu­tors said, were the fa­ther of a stu­dent at Mr Paty’s school and another per­son on the radar of in­tel­li­gence ser­vices, who they said had used so­cial me­dia to campaign against the teacher.</p>
    <p>A ju­di­cial source told Reuters the man known to the in­tel­li­gence agen­cies was Moroc­can-born Ab­del­hakim Se­friuoi. It is said that he has for years used so­cial me­dia to fight against what he calls “Is­lama­pho­bia” and to put pres­sure on the French gov­ern­ment over its treat­ment of Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he ag­i­tated against a high school in Saint-Ouen, a work­ing­class city with a large Mus­lim com­mu­nity near Paris, be­cause it wanted to ban cloth­ing used by Mus­lim girls to cir­cum­vent a ban on veils.</p>
    <p>Se­friuoi has been on the French in­tel­li­gence ser­vices watch list for more than 15 years, se­cu­rity sources told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Mr Dar­manin said the two men’s calls for ac­tion against Mr Paty served as a fatwa against him.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, tens of thou­sands of people ral­lied in Paris and cities across France on Sun­day to pay trib­ute to Mr Paty.</p>
    <p>De­mon­stra­tors at the Place de la Republique in the French cap­i­tal held aloft posters declar­ing: “No to to­tal­i­tar­i­an­ism of thought” and “I am a teacher” in mem­ory of the mur­dered teacher.</p>
    <p>“You do not scare us. We are not afraid. You will not di­vide us. We are France!” tweeted Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex, who joined the Paris demon­stra­tion. Politi­cians from the other ma­jor par­ties also at­tended the event.</p>
    <p>You do not scare us. We are not afraid. You will not di­vide us. We are France!</p>
