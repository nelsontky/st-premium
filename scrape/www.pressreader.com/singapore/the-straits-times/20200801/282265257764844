    <p>The im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on re­tail­ing hit home for jew­ellery and prop­erty player Aspial, with its earn­ings plung­ing in the first half.</p>
    <p>Net profit came in at $5.5 mil­lion for the six months to June 30, down 63 per cent from the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Aspial did not de­clare an in­terim div­i­dend this year to re­tain cash for work­ing cap­i­tal. It paid an in­terim div­i­dend of 0.38 cent a share for the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the half year fell 25.1 per cent to $234.2 mil­lion, ow­ing to lower con­tri­bu­tions from the real es­tate and jew­ellery seg­ments. This was partly off­set by the fi­nan­cial ser­vices seg­ment.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate turnover fell by 38.6 per cent to $98.7 mil­lion, with sales for the pe­riod com­ing mainly from its Aus­tralia 108 pro­ject in Mel­bourne, which will achieve full com­ple­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, the jew­ellery unit’s rev­enue fell by 46.4 per cent to $34 mil­lion as shops were closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, Aspial noted on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, turnover from the fi­nan­cial ser­vices divi­sion rose by 11.7 per cent to $102.8 mil­lion, ow­ing to higher con­tri­bu­tions from pawn­broking and jew­ellery trad­ing. This was par­tially off­set by lower rev­enue from sales of jew­ellery and branded mer­chan­dise in Sin­ga­pore, as well as the se­cured lend­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Aspial ex­pects chal­leng­ing con­di­tions to per­sist. “The Covid-19 pan­demic has led to ma­jor dis­rup­tions in sup­ply chain and cross­bor­der travel af­fect­ing the econ­omy, em­ploy­ment and re­tail sen­ti­ments,” it said.</p>
    <p>“Al­though gov­ern­ments have pro­vided var­i­ous short-term sub­si­dies and sup­port, the group will need to strengthen its prod­uct and ser­vice in­no­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the half year fell 25.1 per cent to $234.2 mil­lion, ow­ing to lower con­tri­bu­tions from the real es­tate and jew­ellery seg­ments. This was partly off­set by the fi­nan­cial ser­vices seg­ment.</p>
