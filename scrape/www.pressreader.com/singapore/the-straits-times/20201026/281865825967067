    <p>BANGKOK • Thou­sands of peo­ple protested in the cen­tre of Thai­land’s cap­i­tal Bangkok yes­ter­day in the first demon­stra­tion since Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha ig­nored their Satur­day night dead­line to re­sign.</p>
    <p>It was also the first ma­jor show of force since Mr Prayut lifted the Oct 15 emer­gency mea­sures that had been meant to stop three months of protests against the gov­ern­ment and monar­chy, but which brought tens of thou­sands of peo­ple onto the streets.</p>
    <p>“If he doesn’t re­sign, then we must come out to ask him to quit in a peace­ful way,” protest leader Jatu­pat “Pai” Boon­pat­tararaksa said as peo­ple chanted “Prayut Out”.</p>
    <p>He reaf­firmed the move­ment’s core three de­mands – for Mr Prayut to step down, a rewrite of the 2017 mil­i­tary-scripted Con­sti­tu­tion, and for the au­thor­i­ties to “stop ha­rass­ing” po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter’s of­fice posted a note on Twit­ter to say Mr Prayut was not quit­ting. He has said the cri­sis should be dis­cussed in Par­lia­ment, which is due to hold a spe­cial ses­sion to­day and to­mor­row. But his op­po­nents have lit­tle faith in an as­sem­bly dom­i­nated by his sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>There was no sign of a ma­jor po­lice pres­ence around pro­test­ers at the Ratchapra­song In­ter­sec­tion, an emo­tive lo­ca­tion for pro­test­ers as the scene of blood­shed in 2010 in a crack­down by se­cu­rity forces on anti-es­tab­lish­ment protests.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment spokesman said there would be no use of force and called on peo­ple to re­main peace­ful and re­spect the law.</p>
    <p>The gath­er­ing saw a di­verse crowd – drag queens in full re­galia, young peo­ple in hard hats ready for a po­lice crack­down and older pro­test­ers wor­ried about Thai­land’s free-fall­ing economy.</p>
    <p>Protests since mid-July have put the great­est pres­sure in years on the es­tab­lish­ment, par­tic­u­larly with taboo-break­ing calls to limit the pow­ers of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers are plan­ning to march to the Ger­man Em­bassy to­day in a mes­sage to the King, who is cur­rently in Thai­land, but spends much of his time in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing to the Ger­man Em­bassy re­flects the ev­i­dent prob­lem of the King’s ex­er­cise of power mak­ing many peo­ple un­com­fort­able and raises ques­tions whether it vi­o­lates the Ger­man law,” said ac­tivist Pi­yarat “Toto” Chongthep.</p>
    <p>The monarch has been back in Thai­land for the past week and a half to com­mem­o­rate a Bud­dhist hol­i­day and the death of his late fa­ther Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej.</p>
    <p>He has not com­mented on the demon­stra­tions, de­spite ten­sion in Bangkok as pro­test­ers grow bolder in their chal­lenge to the royal in­sti­tu­tion. But the king has made rare public vis­its with his sup­port­ers wait­ing out­side the palace – a charm of­fen­sive for an army of lo­cal and internatio­nal me­dia.</p>
    <p>Thais abroad have also held demon­stra­tions in sol­i­dar­ity with the stu­dent move­ment, with some gath­er­ing in Tokyo yes­ter­day, wav­ing the three-fin­ger salute while pro­test­ers in Seoul held signs that said “Re­store power to the peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing public dis­ap­proval of Mr Prayut’s per­for­mance is fu­elling the anti-gov­ern­ment protests, ac­cord­ing to an opin­ion poll.</p>
    <p>More than 62 per cent of par­tic­i­pants in a sur­vey last week said dis­con­tent with Mr Prayut was the key rea­son for the re­cent demon­stra­tions, the poll by Suan Dusit Univer­sity showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>About 50 per cent of the 5,738 par­tic­i­pants dur­ing the Oct 19 to 22 poll be­lieved the pro­test­ers are fight­ing for more democ­racy and an end to the con­tin­u­a­tion of the “dic­ta­tor­ship”. An­other sur­vey by the Na­tional In­sti­tute of De­vel­op­ment Ad­min­is­tra­tion from Oct 19 to 20 showed 59 per cent of the 1,336 re­spon­dents are wor­ried the protests will lead to vi­o­lence and con­flict.</p>
    <p>While about 36 per cent of the par­tic­i­pants have yet to de­cide on sup­port­ing ei­ther the pro­test­ers or the gov­ern­ment, 33 per cent said they had made up their minds.</p>
    <p>CALL TO RE­SIGN If he doesn’t re­sign, then we must come out to ask him to quit in a peace­ful way. PROTEST LEADER JATU­PAT “PAI” BOON­PAT­TARARAKSA, re­fer­ring to Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha.</p>
