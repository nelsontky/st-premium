    <p>The In­terCon­ti­nen­tal Sin­ga­pore ho­tel lets me try its Her­itage Suite, which, hon­estly, is too nice a place to ruin with work.</p>
    <p>My suite, with its Per­anakan-in­flu­enced touches, is de­signed for mak­ing happy mem­o­ries of Sin­ga­pore, so vis­i­tors get to bask in lux­ury after a day of look­ing at nice things around town and, as they sink into cool sheets, to smile as they re­mem­ber the sa­tay at Lau Pa Sat and the rides at Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios.</p>
    <p>In­stead, here I am, a grubby lo­cal with a lap­top.</p>
    <p>After a morn­ing spent do­ing in­ter­views and fir­ing e-mails from my home of­fice (a desk sink­ing un­der an alarm­ing amount of de­tri­tus), I check in late – at around 4pm – and crack on with be­ing su­per pro­duc­tive in an en­vi­ron­ment made for in­dul­gence.</p>
    <p>I mean, the shower stall and ful­l­length bath­tub are two sep­a­rate ar­eas. That sort of in­dul­gence, and the large-screen tele­vi­sions – one in the liv­ing area, the other fac­ing the bed – need to be tested for the pur­pose of this re­view. In the in­ter­est of thor­ough­ness, after chan­nel-surf­ing for a cou­ple of hours, I note that the tele­vi­sions and movie chan­nels work as in­tended.</p>
    <p>Back to work. Five min­utes is spent set­ting up my lap­top and log­ging into the Wi-Fi (strength: good, speed: scorch­ing) and – good­ness me, time flies doesn’t it? – it is din­ner time.</p>
    <p>Check­out time for the In­terCon­ti­nen­tal’s work-from-ho­tel pack­age is 7pm. This re­view in­cludes its $100 overnight add-on ($150 with a part­ner), so I have to test the suite fur­ther and, with a soft sigh, I let my­self sink fur­ther into the sofa.</p>
    <p>What would be the point of work­ing in a ho­tel if I do not avail my­self of its ameni­ties, such as room ser­vice? One quick phone call later, a spicy lamb pizza is sent up. It leaves me in a food coma. The cure – a hot soak.</p>
    <p>I used to travel for work, mainly in the re­gion, but since the clo­sure of routes, I have for­got­ten how much I missed a nice ho­tel, a place where staff speak in hushed voices, where the lift doors close with a hiss and there is a tray of sweets await­ing you in the room, which you scarf down while catch­ing up on what ev­ery­one is say­ing on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>In spite of how the In­terCon­ti­nen­tal is 25 min­utes by MRT from home, com­ing back to the ho­tel life is a re­li­gious ex­pe­ri­ence. Such thoughts float through my mind as my body mar­i­nates in soapy wa­ter. That done, I get back to the work desk, but as my MacBook wakes up, my brain is shut­ting down. Time for bed.</p>
    <p>The next morn­ing, after break­fast at Ash & Elm restau­rant, in­cluded in the overnight pack­age, I have an ex­cuse to keep my lap­top closed be­cause I have to be away watch­ing a film I need to re­view.</p>
    <p>Movie over, it is back to the same restau­rant for lunch.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that sus­te­nance comes to hand eas­ily for hard-charg­ing ex­ec­u­tives like me, the $200 work-from-ho­tel pack­age in­cludes a twocourse set lunch or $30 in lunch credit. Again, I have a pizza I will think about for weeks – hick­ory BBQ chicken this time – then it is time to check out.</p>
    <p>In the 22 hours I am there, I should have cranked out a chap­ter of the Great Sin­ga­pore Novel, or one not-so-great fea­ture ar­ti­cle. But I be­come a kid in a candy store and do ev­ery­thing but work.</p>
    <p>This is maybe why, ac­cord­ing to the ho­tel, many buy­ing the 7amto-7pm work pack­age opt for two days.</p>
    <p>That just makes sense. A worka­tion is two words – work and va­ca­tion – and on day one, you are as likely as me to ig­nore the first and em­brace the sec­ond.</p>
