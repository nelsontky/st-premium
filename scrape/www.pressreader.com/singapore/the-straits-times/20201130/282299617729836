    <p>From slather­ing mud to eat­ing strange roots, peo­ple have tried dif­fer­ent ways to stay young, but an ex­per­i­ment on mice in­volv­ing fae­cal mat­ter is giv­ing hope that hu­mans may slow down the age­ing process while tack­ling con­di­tions such as de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Doctors have known for some time that fae­cal mat­ter is a win­dow to the tril­lions of good and bad bac­te­ria, viruses and fungi liv­ing in the in­testines, col­lec­tively known as the gut mi­cro­biome.</p>
    <p>What a lay­man may de­scribe as a poo trans­plant – tak­ing fae­cal bac­te­ria f rom donors, pro­cess­ing them and in­sert­ing them into the pa­tient’s gut ei­ther orally or through a colonoscop­y – has been used to suc­cess­fully treat Clostrid­ium dif­fi­cile in­fec­tion, which causes re­cur­rent se­vere di­ar­rhoea and colon in­flam­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The trans­planted fae­cal mat­ter re­stores the pa­tient’s gut mi­cro­biome by in­tro­duc­ing healthy bac­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Be­yond keep­ing the gut healthy, the mi­cro­biome is known to im­pact the brain as well. Although they are far away from each other, the stom­ach and the brain have a two-way com­mu­ni­ca­tion known as the brain-gut axis.</p>
    <p>Now, sci­en­tists in Europe have found that fae­cal mat­ter is hid­ing clues re­lated to age­ing and cog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>When the sci­en­tists trans­planted fae­cal mat­ter from old mice into young mice, the younger ones faced prob­lems re­lated to mem­ory and nav­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“In short, the young mice be­gan to be­have like older mice,” said a co-lead of the re­search, Dr David Vau­zour, who is se­nior re­search fel­low at the Univer­sity of East Anglia in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The mem­bers of the re­search team are mainly from his univer­sity, the Univer­sity of Florence in Italy, and the Quadram In­sti­tute in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>In the nav­i­ga­tion test, the young trans­plant re­cip­i­ents were found to be slower.</p>
    <p>They took about 41 sec­onds to find and en­ter the cor­rect hole that led to a cage, while mice from two con­trol groups took 30 and 23 sec­onds re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In the mem­ory test, the mice were given a set of fa­mil­iar and new ob­jects. Be­ing in­quis­i­tive crea­tures, they should spend more time fid­dling with the new ob­ject.</p>
    <p>But the trans­plant re­cip­i­ents were not that in­ter­ested in the</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Clau­dio Ni­co­letti (left) of the Univer­sity of Florence in Italy, and Dr David Vau­zour, se­nior re­search fel­low at the Univer­sity of East Anglia in Bri­tain, are co-leads of the re­search on fae­cal mat­ter. new ob­ject, com­pared with those in the con­trol groups.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists then opened up their brains, ze­ro­ing in on the hip­pocam­pus, the re­gion that plays a vi­tal role in learn­ing and mem­ory.</p>
    <p>They found that the pro­teins that were ex­pressed in the brains of the mice which un­der­went trans­plan­ta­tion were dif­fer­ent from that of the con­trol group.</p>
    <p>For one thing, the tan­gled tau pro­tein, which is preva­lent i n those with Alzheimer’s dis­ease, saw an uptick in the young mice, said Dr Vau­zour.</p>
    <p>The study was pub­lished in the jour­nal Mi­cro­biome last month.</p>
    <p>The re­search’s other co-lead, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Clau­dio Ni­co­letti of the Univer­sity of Florence, said: “This work pro­vides a strong ra­tio­nale to de­vise ther­a­pies aim­ing to re­store a young-like mi­cro­biome to im­prove cog­ni­tive func­tions and qual­ity of life in the el­derly.”</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the find­ings, Dr Jeremy Lim, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder of the Asian Mi­cro­biome Li­brary in Sin­ga­pore, said: “If the sci­ence is con­sis­tent in hu­mans, it may open the door to mod­i­fy­ing the gut mi­cro­biome to treat de­men­tia and other brain health con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean team is now study­ing older mice trans­planted with the fae­cal mat­ter of young mice.</p>
    <p>The team is also dis­cussing with a cen­tre in the Nether­lands about sim­i­lar re­search with pri­mates.</p>
    <p>Dr Ni­co­letti said: “If you im­prove cog­ni­tion or other func­tions in old mon­keys, chances are you can do the same in hu­mans.</p>
    <p>“If we see very pos­i­tive re­sults in the cur­rent mice study, we can start clin­i­cal tri­als on hu­mans within two years.”</p>
