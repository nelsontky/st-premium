    <p>F4 RE­UNION: F4 are back to­gether af­ter seven years. The for­mer Tai­wanese boy band, com­pris­ing Jerry Yan, Vic Chou, Ken Chu and Van Ness Wu, last per­formed to­gether at Jiangsu Tele­vi­sion’s Spring Fes­ti­val Gala in Jan­uary 2013.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese tele­vi­sion sta­tion an­nounced ear­lier this week that they would be per­form­ing to­gether on the show One Thousand And One Nights, which would air to­day.</p>
    <p>The sta­tion also re­leased a trailer show­ing the four stars pro­mot­ing the show separately.</p>
    <p>While fans of F4 were ex­cited about the news of the re­union, they re­acted dif­fer­ently to how their idols look now.</p>
    <p>Many said Yan, 43, and Chou, 39, were still as hand­some as they used to be in the lat­est video, while Wu, 42, still looked stylish.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they said that Chu, 41, ap­peared to have gained weight, not­ing that his face has grown rounder.</p>
    <p>F4 shot to star­dom overnight in the pop­u­lar 2001 idol drama, Me­teor Gar­den, an adap­ta­tion of the Ja­panese girls’ comic Boys Over Flow­ers.</p>
    <p>The show led to a se­quel in 2002 and also sub­se­quent tele­vi­sion adap­ta­tions in Ja­pan and South Korea and a re­make in China.</p>
    <p>The show’s theme song Me­teor Rain also be­came fa­mous and led to F4-ma­nia in Asia.</p>
    <p>The four have gone their separate ways since 2009.</p>
