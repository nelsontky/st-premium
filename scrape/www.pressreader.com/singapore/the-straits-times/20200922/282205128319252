    <p>Lo­cal shares closed lower in tan­dem with re­gional mar­kets yes­ter­day, amid a bear­ish­ness driven largely by pock­ets of resur­gence of Covid-19 across the globe, par­tic­u­larly in Europe and Britain.</p>
    <p>In­vestors were also un­nerved by steep falls on Wall Street on Fri­day that hinted at more volatil­ity in the weeks ahead, with the United States elec­tions heat­ing up.</p>
    <p>The wary mood left the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex down 12 points or 0.48 per cent at 2,485.71 with 1.37 bil­lion shares worth $988.07 mil­lion changed hands. Losers well out­num­bered gain­ers 350 to 127.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephen Innes, chief global mar­kets strate­gist at Ax­iCorp, noted that an added “drip-feed of neg­a­tiv­ity” is plagu­ing mar­kets amid the ap­proach­ing US elec­tions.</p>
    <p>He said: “There is a re­mark­able ten­dency for fear to build, and volatil­ity rises about four to six weeks be­fore vot­ing events, even if we have talked about them for months ahead.</p>
    <p>“There is al­ways a bit of a panic at­tack, and this one could be worse when viewed through the coro­n­avirus lens.”</p>
    <p>Pramer­ica chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Fabrizio Fior­ini told Bloomberg</p>
    <p>News that there are “too many ex­pec­ta­tions about the US eco­nomic re­silience”, adding “there is more sell-off to come. Elec­tion risk is un­der­es­ti­mated”.</p>
    <p>Only three of the 30 STI con­stituent stocks fin­ished the day up. Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings was the biggest ad­vancer for the day, clos­ing 1.58 per cent higher at US$41.17 while Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings ad­vanced 0.97 per cent to US$20.85.</p>
    <p>STI gainer Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries climbed, fol­low­ing news of its $1.5 mil­lion in­vest­ment into a fund to sup­port es­sen­tial work­ers, char­i­ties and mi­grant work­ers. The counter ended the day at $1.34, up 0.75 per cent. At the other end of the spec­trum, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines emerged the biggest loser, down 2.29 per cent to close at $3.42. Air­line gate­way ser­vices provider Sats lost 1.4 per cent to $2.82.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets mostly ended lower, in line with the Wall Street re­treat.</p>
    <p>The Hang Seng In­dex lost 2.06 per cent on in­vestor con­cerns that the fresh coro­n­avirus spikes may be forc­ing gov­ern­ments to re-im­pose econ­omy-dam­ag­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The Shang­hai Com­pos­ite fell 0.63 per cent while Malaysian stocks dipped 0.48 per cent but the Nikkei 225 bucked the trend, inch­ing up 0.18 per cent.</p>
    <p>The S&P/ASX 200 in Aus­tralia closed at a 2.5-month low af­ter drop­ping 0.7 per cent on the back of losses among min­ers and the big fi­nan­cial play­ers.</p>
