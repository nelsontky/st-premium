    <p>With her mouth taped and hands tied be­hind her back, 15-year-old Benjamapor­n Ni­vas sits un­der a sky­train sta­tion look­ing stonily past the shop­pers in Bangkok’s Siam Square district.</p>
    <p>She is wear­ing her school uni­form. There is a pair of scis­sors on her lap, along with a sign that says: “This stu­dent has bro­ken rules by hav­ing hair longer than her ear­lobes and bangs that cover her face. This tar­nishes the im­age of Thai stu­dents. Please pun­ish her.”</p>
    <p>This re­cent stunt got the Thai pub­lic talk­ing about the long-stand­ing hair­style reg­u­la­tions in state schools that crit­ics say are en­forced through rou­tine pub­lic hu­mil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>While an Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry di­rec­tive in May re­laxed these rules, some schools refuse to budge.</p>
    <p>Bad Stu­dent, run by Benjamapor­n and three other stu­dents, has amassed 25,000 fol­low­ers on Twit­ter and some 1,700 mem­bers in a Line chat group over the three months of its ex­is­tence. It has been fea­tured on tele­vi­sion, and now even runs a hotline for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Its promi­nence is tes­ta­ment to the grow­ing clout of Thai­land’s teen ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>“I want to be the voice for stu­dents distressed by this ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem – who face forced hair­cuts, who are hit, who are forced to leave school – but are un­able to speak out,” the book­ish-look­ing Benjamapor­n tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Such stir­rings of dis­sent are be­com­ing ap­par­ent in pub­lic high schools, long bas­tions of tra­di­tion and hi­er­ar­chy, where boys in mil­i­tary-style crew cuts and girls in uni­form bobs carry the same back­packs and don at­tire em­broi­dered with their full names.</p>
    <p>In Bodin­decha, one of the top high schools in Bangkok, stu­dents have set up Face­book, Twit­ter and In­sta­gram ac­counts to pres­sure the ad­min­is­tra­tion to drop the prac­tice of hav­ing school­child­ren pros­trate them­selves be­fore teach­ers ev­ery day in the school carpark.</p>
    <p>Across Thai­land, high school stu­dents are be­com­ing no­tice­able in grow­ing anti-gov­ern­ment protests fronted by ter­tiary stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In Petch­abun, Phrae and Chon­buri prov­inces as well as Bangkok last week, such young­sters joined flash mobs and ral­lies wear­ing their school uni­forms.</p>
    <p>“High school stu­dents have be­come one of the ma­jor forces be­hind the cur­rent stu­dent move­ment,” says Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Kanokrat Lertchoosa­kul.</p>
    <p>The phe­nom­e­non, she says, started some seven years ago, when a band of teenagers call­ing them­selves Ed­u­ca­tion for the Lib­er­a­tion of Siam (ELS) de­manded re­form of Thai­land’s out­dated cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>It was dur­ing this pe­riod that roy­al­ist pro­test­ers oc­cu­pied the streets of Bangkok to crip­ple the Yingluck Shi­nawa­tra ad­min­is­tra­tion, even­tu­ally trig­ger­ing the 2014 mil­i­tary coup. The re­sult­ing gains made by Thai­land’s right wing left a sti­fling im­print on schools, seed­ing dis­sent among mil­len­ni­als, says Dr Kanokrat.</p>
    <p>ELS was l ed by Mr Neti­wit Chotiphat­phaisal, who even­tu­ally en­rolled in Chu­la­longkorn to study po­lit­i­cal sci­ence in 2016 and scan­dalised its con­ser­va­tive fac­ulty by re­fus­ing to pros­trate be­fore the stat­ues of two mon­archs dur­ing his fresh­man in­duc­tion cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Just months later, he was cho­sen by his peers to lead the univer­sity’s stu­dent coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the for­tunes of the now-dis­solved Fu­ture For­ward Party have stirred both hope and anger among the young, says Dr Kanokrat. The youth vote helped the pro­gres­sive party nab the third­high­est num­ber of seats in last year’s gen­eral elec­tion, but it was dis­solved by the Con­sti­tu­tional Court in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion helped so­lid­ify the power of the rul­ing coali­tion, which re­in­stated coup leader Prayut Chan-o-cha as Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The court ver­dict trig­gered a wave of protests in uni­ver­si­ties across the na­tion that was paused only by re­stric­tions on pub­lic gath­er­ings im­posed to con­trol the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Now, with virus com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion un­der con­trol, Thai­land’s young dis­si­dents are once again hit­ting the streets.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day af­ter­noon, stu­dents from Bangkok’s elite Triam Udom Suksa high school braved the rain to chant slo­gans on cam­pus de­mand­ing that Par­lia­ment be dis­solved.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Nat­aphol Teep­suwan, the 10th per­son to hold this port­fo­lio over the past 10 years, has de­fended the stu­dents’ right to protest. “It’s fine. It’s part of their le­gal ex­pres­sion to the sit­u­a­tion,” he tells The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“As long as they un­der­stand the con­se­quences in­volved, they un­der­stand there are laws, reg­u­la­tions like the crowd con­trol Act that they’ve got to ob­serve.”</p>
    <p>He is more con­cerned about their mes­sages on so­cial me­dia, which play a big part in their ad­vo­cacy. “My point of con­cern would be the in­for­ma­tion that they have pro­duced or passed along, whether that has been care­fully thought out, or if they fully un­der­stand the im­pli­ca­tions,” he says. “I am more con­cerned about their ma­tu­rity in terms of un­der­stand­ing the sen­si­tive con­se­quences for each con­text. That comes with time.”</p>
    <p>He calls it a learn­ing process for “ev­ery­body in­volved”.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing to put re­stric­tions on what they pass along,” he em­pha­sises. “But at the same time, we want them to be care­ful.”</p>
    <p>Bad Stu­dent’s Twit­ter ac­count posts – Wik­iLeaks style – pic­tures of stu­dents’ scalps with ghastly shaves meted out by teach­ers as pun­ish­ment, as well as au­dio record­ings of teach­ers try­ing to ban­ish stu­dents for their ir­reg­u­lar hair­dos.</p>
    <p>“So­cial me­dia al­lows ev­ery­body to ac­cess the truth,” says Benjamapor­n. “And when stu­dents see other stu­dents de­mand­ing that peo­ple re­spect their hu­man rights, it makes them aware they have these rights too.”</p>
    <p>While it may be too early to say if high school ac­tivism on spe­cific is­sues such as forced hair­cuts and pros­tra­tion would snow­ball into a larger po­lit­i­cal move­ment, teenagers in­ter­viewed read­ily link the fail­ings of the school sys­tem to Thai­land’s larger power struc­tures. And they are also cre­at­ing in­ter­school net­works of their own.</p>
    <p>Benjamapor­n draws a stark par­al­lel be­tween school and na­tional au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Thai stu­dents can­not bear such dic­ta­tor­ship any­more,” she says.</p>
    <p>Aye (not his real name), a stu­dent at Bodin­decha lead­ing the cam­paign against pros­tra­tion, says: “I feel that while the world is pro­gress­ing, the prac­tices in Thai­land have stayed the same. Some­times they regress. Kids like us can­not take it any­more.”</p>
    <p>VOICE FOR STU­DENTS</p>
    <p>I want to be the voice for stu­dents distressed by this ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem – who face forced hair­cuts, who are hit, who are forced to leave school – but are un­able to speak out.</p>
