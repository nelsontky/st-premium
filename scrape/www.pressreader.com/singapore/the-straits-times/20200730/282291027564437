    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank has asked lo­cally in­cor­po­rated lenders to cap their 2020 div­i­dends at 60 per cent of last year’s lev­els, to en­sure a suf­fi­cient flow of loans as they con­front the down­turn trig­gered by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) wants to “en­sure the banks’ cap­i­tal buf­fers re­main am­ple in the face of sig­nif­i­cant un­cer­tain­ties ahead, so they can sus­tain lend­ing to the econ­omy”, said its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon yes­ter­day in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The MAS said its stress tests have shown that the lo­cal banks re­main re­silient, and it made the re­quest as a pre-emp­tive mea­sure.</p>
    <p>It asked the Sin­ga­pore banks to of­fer share­hold­ers the op­tion of re­ceiv­ing 2020 div­i­dends in scrip in lieu of cash.</p>
    <p>Other cen­tral banks, in­clud­ing the United States Fed­eral Re­serve, the Bank of Eng­land and the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank, have al­ready an­nounced curbs on their banks’ div­i­dend pay­ments.</p>
    <p>A move by the cen­tral bank had been ex­pected since Mr Menon told a me­dia brief­ing ear­lier this month that the MAS was in talks with the banks on their cap­i­tal man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>San­ford C. Bern­stein an­a­lyst Kevin Kwek said: “If no limit was im­posed, the Sin­ga­porean banks would stand out among the few glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“Nev­er­the­less, it takes away one rea­son to own the stocks in the face of low in­ter­est rates and I ex­pect the stocks will suf­fer from knee-jerk sell­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s largest bank, DBS Group, is due to re­port its sec­ondquar­ter re­sults next Thurs­day, to­gether with United Overseas Bank.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank will re­port the fol­low­ing day. Ac­cord­ing to chief ex­ec­u­tive Samuel Tsien, the bank plans to heed the MAS’ re­quest.</p>
    <p>“With wors­en­ing eco­nomic con­di­tions as well as sig­nif­i­cant un­cer­tain­ties over how the cri­sis will evolve, it is only pru­dent for us to con­serve and build up our cap­i­tal to sup­port our cus­tomers dur­ing this very dif­fi­cult pe­riod,” he said in an e-mailed state­ment.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to the Sin­ga­pore bourse, DBS said it ex­pects to cap its div­i­dend at a total of $0.18 per share per quar­ter over the next four quar­ters, or $0.72 per share total.</p>
    <p>The 60 per cent cap “recog­nises the in­ter­ests of share­hold­ers as it is not as se­vere as the re­stric­tions in some other ju­ris­dic­tions, which in­clude an out­right halt to dis­tri­bu­tions”, a DBS spokesman said.</p>
    <p>In April, the MAS had urged banks to en­sure that sus­tained lend­ing took pri­or­ity over dis­cre­tionary dis­tri­bu­tions, but added that it did not “see a need to re­strict banks’ div­i­dend poli­cies”.</p>
