    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ex­posed vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in many sys­tems around the world, and the best way to man­age this knowl­edge is not to cast blame on past ac­tions, but to en­hance our re­silience as we move for­ward to be bet­ter pre­pared for the next sys­tem shock.</p>
    <p>To­tal De­fence has been the cor­ner­stone of our na­tion, and it has served us well, es­pe­cially as we jour­ney through the cur­rent pan­demic.</p>
    <p>I was re­cently ad­mit­ted to the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal. I am very thank­ful to the team of health­care work­ers at my ward – staff and vol­un­teers – who at­tended to me, with spe­cial men­tion to a group of nurs­ing interns from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) who tended to me with care and pro­fes­sion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>I ap­plaud ITE Col­lege East staff for churn­ing out such good role mod­els for our youth. I also met a nurs­ing grad­u­ate from ITE who had so much en­ergy and drive to do the right thing for the pa­tients un­der his care.</p>
    <p>There seemed to be many young men in this co­hort of interns, which made me ques­tion why nurs­ing is not an op­tion for na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Give full-time na­tional ser­vice­men the op­tion to choose nurs­ing as their vo­ca­tion dur­ing their ba­sic mil­i­tary train­ing, es­pe­cially if they see it as a fu­ture pro­fes­sion. As op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men, they can pro­vide med­i­cal sup­port for the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces or the Home Team.</p>
    <p>Nurs­ing is a key pil­lar of To­tal De­fence in the light of pan­demics and other health­care shocks in the fu­ture.</p>
