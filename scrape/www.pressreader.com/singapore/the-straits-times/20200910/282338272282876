    <p>NEW YORK Alexan­der Zverev lashed out at Martina Navratilov­a af­ter the 18-time Grand Slam cham­pion said he at times played “pata-cake” ten­nis dur­ing his vic­tory over Borna Coric in the quar­ter-fi­nals of the US Open on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The fifth seed was a set and 4-2 down in his con­test against the Croa­t­ian be­fore pre­vail­ing 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 in 3hr 25min to reach his sec­ond Grand Slam semi-fi­nal of the year.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old bris­tled when he was told that Navratilov­a said, while com­ment­ing on TV, that he would never win a Grand Slam play­ing the way he had.</p>
    <p>“Maybe she should look at my record against the big guys,” said the Ger­man, who plays Spa­niard Pablo Car­reno Busta in the last four.</p>
    <p>“Maybe she should look that I’m pos­i­tive against Roger (Fed­erer).</p>
    <p>“Maybe she should look that I’ve beaten No­vak (Djokovic) on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions in big matches and fi­nals. And I’m in the semi-fi­nals, and some­times not play­ing your best and find­ing a way is more im­por­tant than play­ing your best.</p>
    <p>“But she’s a Grand Slam cham­pion, as well, mul­ti­ple Grand Slam cham­pion, she’s re­spected, but her opin­ion right now does not mat­ter to me.”</p>
    <p>Zverev has two wins in five meet­ings against world No. 1 Djokovic, in­clud­ing the 2018 ATP Fi­nals ti­tle de­cider. He leads his head-to-head meet­ings against 20-time Ma­jor cham­pion Fed­erer 4-3.</p>
    <p>Navratilov­a clar­i­fied that her com­ment had been about how pas­sive “Sasha”, who failed to get past the quar­ter-fi­nals at a Ma­jor in his first 18 at­tempts, had been dur­ing his slow start.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing like pos­ing a ques­tion in press con­fer­ence with­out con­text,” she posted on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“I said Sasha needs to play like he did in the 4th set, not the way he played the 1st 2 sets. It’s that sim­ple. But yeah, nice jour­nal­ism, who­ever asked the ques­tion. I would have an­swered the same way Sasha did.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Naomi Osaka re­mained on course to win a third Ma­jor ti­tle af­ter sweep­ing aside un­seeded Shelby Rogers 6-3, 6-4 to set up a match with Jen­nifer Brady for a place in Satur­day’s fi­nal. The 2018 US Open cham­pion said her vic­tory was pay­back for three pre­vi­ous de­feats by the 93rd-ranked Rogers.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, I just felt like she had the up­per hand be­cause I’ve never beaten her,” said the fourth seed. “And those mem­o­ries are stuck in my head so I con­sider this a lit­tle bit of re­venge.”</p>
