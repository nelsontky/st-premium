    <p>A universal ba­sic in­come (UBI) is re­gres­sive and means that large num­bers of peo­ple have to be taxed more heav­ily, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Tharman Shanmugara­tnam at the Bloomberg New Econ­omy Fo­rum on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to mod­er­a­tor and Bloomberg Quick­take chief cor­re­spon­dent Ja­son Kelly’s ques­tion on whether gov­ern­ments should in­sti­tute a UBI, Mr Tharman called it a “bad idea” on two counts.</p>
    <p>Firstly, it is re­gres­sive.</p>
    <p>“The idea of giv­ing every­one (the same) quan­tum of money is very dif­fer­ent from giv­ing the poor and the lower-mid­dle-in­come group the sup­port they need.”</p>
    <p>He added that while many UBI pro­po­nents say it is a way of flat­ten­ing the sys­tem of ben­e­fits, he thinks coun­tries need to stack the ben­e­fits in favour of the poor and the lower-mid­dle-in­come group, not give them less.</p>
    <p>“Se­condly, to give the poor what they need through UBI, you’ve got to give every­one that same higher amount. In other words, you don’t just flat­ten the curve but you’ve got to raise the curve. That needs much more taxes.</p>
    <p>“And if we do the arith­metic, it can’t just be taxes on the rich. You need much more taxes on the mid­dle-in­come group in or­der to give every­one the amount of ben­e­fits that the poor ac­tu­ally need.”</p>
    <p>Another ar­gu­ment for UBI is that new forms of au­to­ma­tion and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) will dis­place hu­mans from a much wider range of jobs, and a way must be found to dis­trib­ute pro­duc­tiv­ity gains from au­to­ma­tion and AI to a pop­u­la­tion that may not be fully em­ployed. “We might get to that sit­u­a­tion, but we have no idea whether we will,” he said. More im­por­tantly, what hap­pens de­pends on the ac­tions taken now, he added, and the last thing coun­tries should do is to “give up hope” and go for purely re­dis­tribu­tive, or pas­sive, strate­gies.</p>
    <p>“We do need re­dis­tri­bu­tion. But what we should be do­ing now is in­vest­ing in pub­lic goods, in­vest­ing in pub­lic school sys­tems, and I’m quite op­ti­mistic about that po­ten­tial,” Mr Tharman said.</p>
    <p>He stressed that by in­vest­ing in things that every­one can see op­por­tu­nity in, for them­selves and their fam­i­lies, peo­ple can be brought to­gether be­cause they have a feel­ing that gov­ern­ments are do­ing some­thing for every­one.</p>
    <p>“Let’s talk about how we can do things to de­velop ca­pa­bil­i­ties, de­velop hope and as­pi­ra­tions,” he said. “If we lose the game in 20 or 30 years’ time, we can start talk­ing about UBI, but we first have to get started. We haven’t got­ten started in many coun­tries.”</p>
