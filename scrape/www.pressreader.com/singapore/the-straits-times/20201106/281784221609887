    <p>ROME Italy will from today im­pose a na­tion­wide cur­few and new lock­downs in some of its re­gions to stem a surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>About 60 mil­lion res­i­dents will be re­quired to stay home from 10pm to 5am ex­cept for work or health rea­sons un­der the new de­cree. The new curbs are set to run through Dec 3.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new rules, the coun­try’s re­gions will be di­vided into risk zones based on how quickly the virus is spread­ing and avail­abil­ity of hospi­tal beds, among other fac­tors. “We don’t have al­ter­na­tives,” Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In the hand­ful of high-risk “red zones”, re­tail stores not sell­ing es­sen­tial goods are to shut, peo­ple will not be al­lowed to move freely ex­cept for work, health and emer­gency rea­sons, and from trav­el­ling out­side their home town or city.</p>
    <p>Red-zone ar­eas in­clude the pros­per­ous north­ern re­gion of Lom­bardy and neigh­bour­ing Pied­mont.</p>
    <p>Italy has re­ported 790,377 cases, in­clud­ing the 30,550 new in­fec­tions re­ported in the past 24 hours. Nearly 39,800 peo­ple have died from the virus in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the French cap­i­tal will be placed un­der more re­stric­tions to curb the wors­en­ing pan­demic, in­clud­ing a re­quire­ment for more shops to close in the evening, Paris Mayor Anne Hi­dalgo told BFM TV yes­ter­day. Ms Hi­dalgo said this would en­tail shut­ting down cer­tain shops sell­ing take­away food and drink at 10pm, which would come on top of the ex­ist­ing lock­down im­posed through­out France.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron im­posed a new lock­down last month, forc­ing non-es­sen­tial shops to close and mak­ing peo­ple use signed doc­u­ments to jus­tify be­ing out on the streets.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the au­thor­i­ties be­lieved more mea­sures were needed in Paris as they felt there were still too many peo­ple out in the French cap­i­tal late at night.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, France re­ported 40,558 new Covid-19 cases and a fur­ther 385 deaths, tak­ing the coun­try’s to­tal death toll from the pan­demic to 38,674. The to­tal num­ber of con­firmed Covid-19 cases stands at around 1.5 mil­lion.</p>
