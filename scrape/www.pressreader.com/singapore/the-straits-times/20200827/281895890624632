    <p>The Philip­pines will con­tinue pa­trolling the Spratlys in the South China Sea, ig­nor­ing a warn­ing from China to stop “il­le­gal provo­ca­tions” in wa­ters around the dis­puted is­land chain.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to con­tinue our pa­trol be­cause it’s ours. That’s all there is to it, and then they (China) will con­tinue to call it an il­le­gal provo­ca­tion… but that’s their right. It’s a free world,” For­eign Min­is­ter Teodoro Loc­sin told ABS-CBN News Chan­nel yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>China last Fri­day ac­cused the Philip­pines of “il­le­gal provo­ca­tions” with its rou­tine pa­trols around the Spratlys, in the south­ern half of the South China Sea, where Viet­nam and Tai­wan have also built out­posts.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s re­sponse came af­ter Manila lodged a diplo­matic protest over what it said was China’s il­le­gal con­fis­ca­tion of fish ag­gre­gat­ing de­vices from Filipino fish­er­men in a dis­puted la­goon held by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pine For­eign Min­istry said the in­ci­dent hap­pened three months ago at Scar­bor­ough Shoal, a prime fish­ing site seized by China in 2012 af­ter a naval stand­off with the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also protested against China’s “con­tin­u­ing il­licit is­suances of ra­dio challenges (to) Philip­pine air­craft con­duct­ing le­git­i­mate reg­u­lar mar­itime pa­trols”.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said last Fri­day that Manila was “in­fring­ing on China’s sovereignt­y and se­cu­rity” with its pa­trols around the Spratlys.</p>
    <p>He also de­fended China’s ac­tion at Scar­bor­ough, in­sist­ing “it is be­yond re­proach for China’s Coast Guard to con­duct law en­force­ment (there) as it is a law­ful prac­tice”.</p>
    <p>Mr Loc­sin said he had “for­mally protested (against) cer­tain ac­tions from China in what is indis­putably our ter­ri­to­rial wa­ters”.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Delfin Loren­zana said on Sun­day that “they are the ones who have been do­ing provo­ca­tions by il­le­gally oc­cu­py­ing some fea­tures within our EEZ”, re­fer­ring to the Philip­pines’ ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone. “Their so­called his­tor­i­cal rights over an area en­closed by their nine-dash line doesn’t ex­ist ex­cept in their imag­i­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Bei­jing claims al­most the en­tire South China Sea, of­ten in­vok­ing its nine-dash line to jus­tify its al­leged his­toric rights to the wa­ter­way that is also con­tested by the Philip­pines, In­done­sia, Malaysia, Viet­nam, Tai­wan and Brunei.</p>
    <p>Manila filed a case at the Per­ma­nent Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion at The Hague which ruled in 2016 that there was no le­gal ba­sis for China to claim his­toric rights to re­sources in the ar­eas fall­ing within the “nine-dash line”. But China re­jected the rul­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Loc­sin yes­ter­day also i nsisted Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte was not “kow­tow­ing” to China and had once con­fronted his Chi­nese coun­ter­part about China’s claims in the South China Sea. “There is no kow­tow­ing. The Pres­i­dent him­self con­fronted (Chi­nese Pres­i­dent) Xi Jin­ping,” he said. “The re­ac­tion (from Mr Xi) was not very nice.”</p>
    <p>In his State of the Na­tion Ad­dress last month, Mr Duterte ba­si­cally ad­mit­ted he could only sit back and watch what­ever China does in the dis­puted sea. “So what can we do? We have to go to war, and I can­not af­ford it. Maybe some other pres­i­dent can but I can­not. I’m use­less when it comes to that,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte re­vived the once-icy diplo­matic ties af­ter be­ing elected in 2016 when he largely set aside mar­itime dis­putes in favour of woo­ing Chi­nese aid, trade and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>PA­TROL WILL NOT END</p>
    <p>We’re go­ing to con­tinue our pa­trol be­cause it’s ours. That’s all there is to it, and then they (China) will con­tinue to call it an il­le­gal provo­ca­tion… but that’s their right. It’s a free ’’ world.</p>
