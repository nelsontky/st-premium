    <p>RARE SIGHT­ING: Hong Kong ac­tress Athena Chu (above, right), 48, sel­dom posts pho­tos of her hus­band and daugh­ter (above, left) on so­cial me­dia. Her hus­band is for­mer Be­yond singer Paul Wong, 56, and they have a daugh­ter Deb­bie, who will turn eight later this month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, on Wed­nes­day, the ac­tress posted sev­eral pho­tos of her fam­ily when a Chi­nese re­al­ity show fea­tur­ing her hus­band and daugh­ter, Get Smart! Dad, started screen­ing.</p>
    <p>The show, which in­vites celebrity fa­thers to go on trips with their chil­dren, tests how well fa­ther and child con­nect when they en­counter is­sues like bad weather or un­fa­mil­iar places.</p>
    <p>The show was filmed in 2018, but its tele­cast was post­poned af­ter the Chi­nese govern­ment re­stricted shows fea­tur­ing celebri­ties with their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In her post, Chu wrote in Chi­nese: “My baby girl said to me: ‘I want to travel with mum.’ I said: ‘Mum can’t go with you as she is film­ing a movie.’”</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ued: “But we can watch Get</p>
    <p>Smart! Dad as it is on air. Our fam­ily can meet one another through the TV screen.”</p>
    <p>Chu is cur­rently work­ing on a movie whose Chi­nese ti­tle trans­lates into Rain On Banana Leaves. Known for her sexy image in the 1990s, she is fa­mous for roles such as hero­ine Huang Rong in 1994’s TVB re­make of late writer Louis Cha’s mar­tial arts novel The Le­gend Of The Con­dor He­roes, and the fairy Zixia in the two-part movie A Chi­nese Odyssey (1995), star­ring Stephen Chow and Ng</p>
    <p>Man Tat.</p>
