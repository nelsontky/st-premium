    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Sev­eral com­pa­nies from China have pulled out from clinical tri­als on Covid-19 vac­cines in Malaysia due to a de­cline in cases in the coun­try, Science, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter Khairy Ja­malud­din said.</p>
    <p>“We of­fered China to con­duct clinical tri­als for the vac­cine here, but sev­eral com­pa­nies pulled out dur­ing the ne­go­ti­a­tion process as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases was in de­cline,” the min­is­ter said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“For clinical tri­als to be done, a lot of cases are needed, and that is why the com­pa­nies from China are con­duct­ing them in UAE and Brazil, as both coun­tries have thou­sands of cases.”</p>
    <p>He said the with­drawal of the Chi­nese com­pa­nies was an indi­ca­tion of Malaysia’s suc­cess in con­tain­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Nev­er­the­less, we are still ready for clinical tri­als and have the ecosys­tem and abil­ity via Clinical Re­search Malaysia, while the Gen­eral Clinical Re­search Cen­tre in Sarawak has the abil­ity to carry out first-phase clinical tri­als,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Khairy said he would be holding a video con­fer­ence with his Chi­nese coun­ter­part to­day to fur­ther ex­plore strate­gic part­ner­ship and pos­si­ble ac­cess to a Covid-19 vac­cine un­der devel­op­ment by sev­eral com­pa­nies and in­sti­tu­tions in China.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a sup­ple­men­tary ques­tion by op­po­si­tion MP Sai­fud­din Na­su­tion Is­mail, Mr Khairy said a new road map is needed for the devel­op­ment of hu­man vac­cines to en­sure vac­cine se­cu­rity and self-re­liance for the na­tion in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He said that since 2006, his min­istry and the Higher Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry had spon­sored 55 vac­cine projects car­ried out by 16 lo­cal in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Of th­ese, he said, five hu­man vac­cines are un­der devel­op­ment, while one for pre-clinical tri­als is be­ing de­vel­oped to treat cholera, and 19 an­i­mal vac­cines have been com­mer­cialised.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Mr Khairy told law­mak­ers that genome re­search on the Covid-19 virus was cru­cial for the devel­op­ment of a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>He said re­searchers at t he Malaysian Genome In­sti­tute, Na­tional Public Health Lab­o­ra­tory, In­sti­tute for Med­i­cal Re­search and Univer­siti Malaya have suc­cess­fully iso­lated the virus genome from 21 lo­cal Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
