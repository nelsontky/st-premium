    <p>NEW YORK • With a string of nearmisses at the Ma­jors and Olympic cham­pion Park In-bee breath­ing down her neck, it was a re­lieved Kim Sei-young who tapped in the win­ning putt to claim the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Kim’s five-stroke tri­umph at Aron­imink Golf Course af­ter a bo­geyfree, seven-un­der 63 put paid to her sta­tus as the most pro­lific win­ner on the LPGA Tour among ac­tive play­ers never to have won a Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old did so in scin­til­lat­ing fash­ion, card­ing not only the joint-low­est fi­nal round in tour­na­ment his­tory but also a record-low 14-un­der 266 to­tal to be­come the ninth maiden win­ner in the past 10 Ma­jors.</p>
    <p>“I’m so ex­cited. I’m re­ally hid­ing my tears at the mo­ment. It was amaz­ing that I re­ally won it. So I’m very happy and ex­cited that I got it done,” the South Korean said, beam­ing next to the win­ner’s tro­phy.</p>
    <p>Seven-time Ma­jor cham­pion Park had beaten Kim for the 2015 ti­tle at Westch­ester Coun­try Club and was only three strokes be­hind her com­pa­triot go­ing into the fi­nal round.</p>
    <p>A five-un­der round might get the job done, she thought and the 32-year-old duly de­liv­ered with a 65. But it was not enough as overnight leader Kim rose to the chal­lenge i n Newtown Square, Penn­syl­va­nia, to seal an 11th LPGA tri­umph and her first since last Novem­ber’s Tour Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, Sei-young was just much bet­ter than any­one else out there to­day,” said Park, who had been chas­ing a fourth win in the event, the third Ma­jor of the year.</p>
    <p>“It was just so hard to be­lieve that she never won a Ma­jor be­fore be­cause it felt like she won a few.”</p>
    <p>Kim, who has claimed at least one Tour win each sea­son since 2015, ad­mit­ted to strug­gling with nerves be­fore tee­ing off on Sun­day and kept her eyes averted from the leader­board dur­ing her round.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing fin­ished in a tie for sec­ond at the 2018 Evian Cham­pi­onship and claim­ing an out­right run­ner-up place at the 2015 edi­tion of the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship, she could be for­given for hav­ing but­ter­flies in her stom­ach.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there was to be no near miss this time.</p>
    <p>“I won’t lie, I did feel the pres­sure start­ing last night,” Kim, who beat the pre­vi­ous record low of 267 set by Amer­i­can Betsy King in 1992 at Bethesda Coun­try Club, said. “I ac­tu­ally ar­rived about 30 min­utes later than I nor­mally do at the golf course.</p>
    <p>“I did not look at the score­board once I knew In-bee was go­ing to play great. But I had to just fo­cus on play­ing my own game, one shot at a time.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, I’ m shak­ing my head and my legs were shak­ing but I was able to keep my fo­cus. It means a lot. I feel so emo­tional. It’s a dream come true. I’m wait­ing for a while to reach my big­gest goal.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nasa Hataoka (64) and Spa­niard Car­lota Ci­ganda (65) shared third on 273, while Swe­den’s Anna Nordqvist (71) was fifth on 276. Filip­ina Bianca Pag­dan­ganan (73), who was fifth head­ing into Sun­day, ended joint-ninth on 280, while Malaysia’s Kelly Tan (71), the joint first-round leader, was tied 13th on 281.</p>

    <p>I did not look at the score­board once I knew In-bee was go­ing to play great. But I had to just fo­cus on play­ing my own game, one shot at a time.</p>
