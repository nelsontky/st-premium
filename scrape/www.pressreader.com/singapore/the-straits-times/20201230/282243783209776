    <p>I don’t think reg­u­la­tors are think­ing of break­ing up Ant, as no fin­tech com­pany in China has a mo­nop­oly sta­tus. The act is not just tar­get­ing Ant but also send­ing out a warn­ing to other Chi­nese fin­tech com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang Kai, an an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm Analysys, on tougher over­sight on the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Ant’s growth po­ten­tial will be capped with the fo­cus back onto its pay­ments ser­vices. On the main­land, the on­line pay­ments in­dus­try is sat­u­rated and Ant’s mar­ket share pretty much reached its limit.</p>
    <p>Ms Chen Shu­jin, a Hong Kong-based head of China fi­nan­cial re­search at Jef­feries Fi­nan­cial Group.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • Two months ago, global in­vestors were on the cusp of em­brac­ing a wind­fall from what would have been the world’s largest ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing. Now, re­turns on the hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in­vested with Ant Group are in jeop­ardy.</p>
    <p>Val­ued at about US$315 bil­lion (S$418.7 bil­lion) be­fore its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing was halted, Ant cor­ralled in­vest­ments from the world’s big­gest funds. Among them: War­burg Pin­cus, Car­lyle Group, Sil­ver Lake Man­age­ment, Te­masek Hold­ings and GIC.</p>
    <p>China on Sun­day or­dered Ant to re-ex­am­ine its fin­tech busi­nesses – span­ning from wealth man­age­ment to con­sumer credit lend­ing and in­sur­ance – and re­turn to its roots as a pay­ments service.</p>
    <p>While the cen­tral bank’s state­ment was short on specifics, it presents a se­ri­ous threat to the growth and most lu­cra­tive op­er­a­tions of bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s on­line fi­nance em­pire. Reg­u­la­tors stopped short of ask­ing di­rectly for a break-up of the com­pany, yet stressed it was important Ant “un­der­stand the ne­ces­sity of over­haul­ing its busi­ness” and told it to come up with a plan and timetable as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Ant said in re­sponse that it will set up a spe­cial team to com­ply with reg­u­la­tors’ de­mands. It will main­tain busi­ness op­er­a­tions for users, vow­ing not to raise prices for con­sumers and fi­nan­cial part­ners, while step­ping up risk con­trols.</p>
    <p>Here are some sce­nar­ios from in­vestors and an­a­lysts on what the re­struc­tur­ing could look like:</p>
    <p>Mild</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mists say reg­u­la­tors are merely re­assert­ing their right to over­see the coun­try’s fi­nan­cial sec­tor, send­ing a warn­ing to In­ter­net com­pa­nies with­out in­ten­tions of dras­tic change.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing could be try­ing to make an ex­am­ple out of Mr Ma’s Ant, the largest among a raft of new but per­va­sive fin­tech plat­forms. Past crack­downs of this na­ture have dealt short-term blows to com­pa­nies, leav­ing them mostly un­scathed. Social me­dia gi­ant Ten­cent Hold­ings, for in­stance, be­came a prom­i­nent tar­get of a cam­paign to com­bat gam­ing ad­dic­tion among chil­dren in 2018. While its shares took a hit, they even­tu­ally re­cov­ered to all-time highs.</p>
    <p>Ant’s af­fil­i­ate, Alibaba Group Hold­ing, sim­i­larly re­gained the con­fi­dence of in­vestors after short-run sell­offs fol­low­ing ac­cu­sa­tions by the author­i­ties on ev­ery­thing from un­fairly squeez­ing mer­chants to turn­ing a blind eye to fakes on its e-com­merce plat­form.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think reg­u­la­tors are think­ing of break­ing up Ant, as no fin­tech com­pany in China has a mo­nop­oly sta­tus,” said an­a­lyst</p>
    <p>Zhang Kai at mar­ket re­search firm Analysys. “The act is not just tar­get­ing Ant but also send­ing out a warn­ing to other Chi­nese fin­tech com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>Some see it as an op­por­tu­nity for Ant. With the in­dus­try as a whole fac­ing tougher over­sight, Ant has more re­sources to cope with the chal­lenges as an in­dus­try leader, said Mr Zhang.</p>
    <p>Bad</p>
    <p>A more trou­bling out­come would be if reg­u­la­tors moved to break up Ant Group. That would com­pli­cate the share­holder struc­ture, and hurt the com­pany’s fastest-grow­ing busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The global in­vestors backed the com­pany when it was val­ued at about US$150 bil­lion in its last round of fundrais­ing in 2018. A break-up would make the re­turn on their in­vest­ments un­cer­tain, with the time­line for an IPO that was due last month now pushed into the dis­tant fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment could ask Ant to spin off its more lu­cra­tive op­er­a­tions in wealth man­age­ment, credit lend­ing and in­sur­ance, of­fload­ing them into a fi­nan­cial hold­ing com­pany that will face tougher scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>“The emerg­ing re­al­ity is China’s reg­u­la­tors are adopt­ing sim­i­lar reg­u­la­tion to­ward banks and fin­tech play­ers,” said Mr Michael Nor­ris, re­search and strat­egy man­ager at Shang­hai-based con­sul­tancy Agen­cyChina.</p>
    <p>Ant’s pay­ments busi­ness alone leaves much less to the imag­i­na­tion. While the service han­dled US$17 tril­lion of trans­ac­tions in one year, on­line pay­ments have largely been loss-mak­ing. The two big­gest mo­bile pay­ments op­er­a­tors, Ant and Ten­cent, have heav­ily sub­sidised the busi­nesses, us­ing them as a gate­way to win over users. To make money, they lever­aged the pay­ments ser­vices to cross-sell prod­ucts in­clud­ing wealth man­age­ment and credit lend­ing.</p>
    <p>“Ant’s growth po­ten­tial will be capped with the fo­cus back onto its pay­ments ser­vices,” said Ms Chen Shu­jin, a Hong Kong-based head of China fi­nan­cial re­search at Jef­feries Fi­nan­cial Group. “On the main­land, the on­line pay­ments in­dus­try is sat­u­rated and Ant’s mar­ket share pretty much reached its limit.”</p>
    <p>Night­mare</p>
    <p>The worst-case sce­nario would be for Ant to forgo its money man­age­ment, credit and in­sur­ance busi­nesses, halt­ing its op­er­a­tions in the units that service half a bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Its wealth man­age­ment busi­ness which in­cludes the Yu’ebao plat­form that sells mu­tual funds and money mar­ket funds ac­counted for 15 per cent of rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Credit tech, which in­cludes Ant’s</p>
    <p>Huabei and Jiebei units, was the big­gest rev­enue driver for the group, con­tribut­ing 39 per cent of the to­tal in the first six months this year. It made loans to about 500 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>That out­come would be un­der­pinned by the idea that China’s lead­ers have grown frus­trated with the swag­ger of tech bil­lion­aires and want to teach them a les­son by killing off their busi­nesses – even if it means short-term pain for the econ­omy and mar­kets.</p>
    <p>China’s pri­vate sec­tor has main­tained a del­i­cate re­la­tion­ship with the Com­mu­nist Party for decades, and has only re­cently been recog­nised as cen­tral to the na­tion’s fu­ture. Many com­men­ta­tors have at­trib­uted the re­cent crack­down on fin­tech com­pa­nies to re­marks Mr Ma made at a con­fer­ence in Oc­to­ber, when he de­cried at­tempts to rein in the bur­geon­ing field as short-sighted and out­moded.</p>
    <p>Be­tween them, Alibaba, Ant and Ten­cent com­manded a com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of nearly US$2 tril­lion in Novem­ber, sur­pass­ing state-owned be­he­moths such as the Bank of China as the coun­try’s most valu­able com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The trio have in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars in hun­dreds of up-and-com­ing mo­bile and In­ter­net com­pa­nies, gain­ing king­maker sta­tus in the world’s largest smart­phone and In­ter­net mar­ket by users.</p>
    <p>“The Com­mu­nist Party is the end-all and the be-all in China. It con­trols ev­ery­thing,” said Sin­ga­pore-based re­search fel­low Alex Capri at the Hin­rich Foun­da­tion. “There is noth­ing that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party doesn’t con­trol and any­thing that does ap­pear to be gy­rat­ing out of its or­bit in any way is go­ing to get pulled back very quickly,” he said, adding “we can ex­pect to see more of that”.</p>
