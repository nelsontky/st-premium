    <p>The new Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC) has fixed an IT prob­lem that pre­vented it from re­ceiv­ing cash pay­ments for ser­vice and con­ser­vancy charges (S&CC) at its of­fices on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The glitch had oc­curred be­cause con­fig­u­ra­tions for the front-end col­lec­tion sys­tems were not in place, but had been re­solved as of yes­ter­day, said the Work­ers’ Party-run town coun­cil in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>It added that res­i­dents have been able to pay their S&CC at the town coun­cil’s of­fices since 8am.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, SKTC had is­sued a state­ment about the prob­lem af­ter tak­ing over the full man­age­ment of es­tates in Sengkang GRC that were pre­vi­ously un­der two Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP)-run town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>In that state­ment, it said that staff at SKTC dis­cov­ered in the morn­ing that the con­fig­u­ra­tions were not done.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing our en­gage­ments with the ex­ist­ing IT ven­dor for the Town Coun­cil Man­age­ment Sys­tem (TCMS), we were as­sured of the func­tion­al­ity of the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the staff of SKTC noted at 8am this morn­ing that con­fig­u­ra­tions for the front-end col­lec­tion sys­tems were not in place,” the Wed­nes­day state­ment said.</p>
    <p>It added that SKTC was “work­ing closely with the IT ven­dor to re­store op­er­a­tional func­tion­al­ity of the TCMS as soon as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>When asked, Sengkang GRC MP Louis Chua, who is the town coun­cil’s vice-chair­man, de­clined to com­ment on whether it had hired the IT ven­dor or if it was a pre­vi­ous ven­dor hired by the PAP-run town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>Sengkang GRC, with more than 120,000 vot­ers, is made up of Buangkok, Com­pass­vale and River­vale wards, for­merly un­der the Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC), and the An­chor­vale ward, for­merly un­der Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil (AMKTC).</p>
    <p>WP won Sengkang GRC with 52.12 per cent of the votes at the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>SKTC for­mally took over the man­age­ment and main­te­nance of these ar­eas on Wed­nes­day, and said it would con­tinue to work with EM Ser­vices and CPG Fa­cil­i­ties Man­age­ment, the two man­ag­ing agent firms that had been work­ing with PRPTC and AMKTC.</p>
    <p>SKTC added: “Both man­ag­ing agents have af­firmed their com­mit­ment to SKTC, and that they will work in close col­lab­o­ra­tion to de­liver the high­est stan­dards of es­tate man­age­ment ser­vice to Sengkang res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>“With both man­ag­ing agents con­tin­u­ing town­ship man­age­ment op­er­a­tions, res­i­dents of Sengkang GRC can look for­ward to a smooth han­dover and con­ti­nu­ity in the pro­vi­sion of town­ship ser­vices at Sengkang Town.”</p>
    <p>The PAP town coun­cils had said on Tues­day that ar­range­ments have been made for res­i­dents who pay their S&CC through Giro or other re­cur­ring pay­ment schemes to con­tinue do­ing so with­out dis­rup­tion.</p>
