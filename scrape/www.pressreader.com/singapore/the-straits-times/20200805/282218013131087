    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Last sum­mer, the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers had sev­eral things on the check­list to tick off.</p>
    <p>One was to end their post-sea­son drought dat­ing back to 2013. An­other was to se­cure the No. 1 seed­ing in the ul­tra com­pet­i­tive West­ern Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Their first aim was achieved in early March be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic prompted a four-month plus stop­page of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA).</p>
    <p>Af­ter clinch­ing the top billing in the West with a 116-108 vic­tory over the Utah Jazz at Dis­ney World on Mon­day, the Lak­ers (51-15) are now fully fo­cused on win­ning their first cham­pi­onship since 2010.</p>
    <p>An­thony Davis led all scor­ers af­ter a 42-point ef­fort. The for­ward, who also grabbed 12 re­bounds for Los An­ge­les, had 24 points in the first half alone, making it the 20th time this sea­son he has scored 20 or more in a half – the first Lak­ers player to do so since the late Kobe Bryant in the 2012-13 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Coin­ci­den­tally, the NBA great, who died in a he­li­copter crash in Jan­uary, led the Lak­ers to their 16th ti­tle when they last held the No. 1 seed­ing and Davis feels that he and his team­mates are ready to mir­ror that achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a long time com­ing for the Laker Na­tion,” the for­ward told ESPN. “We’re try­ing to be the best</p>
    <p>DO IT FOR KOBE</p>
    <p>It means a lot to be in a cat­e­gory with him. I just got chills.</p>
    <p>And I know he’s look­ing down on us and cheer­ing us on, so we want to do it for him.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>AN­THONY DAVIS , on match­ing the late Kobe Bryant’s scor­ing record with 24 points in the first half for a game-high 42.</p>
    <p>ver­sion of the team that we can be... It’s a good feel­ing. Ob­vi­ously, we’re not done, we’ve got a long way to go, but it’s a good ac­com­plish­ment for our or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>On match­ing Bryant’s scor­ing feat, Davis said: “It means a lot to be in a cat­e­gory with him. I just got chills.</p>
    <p>“It’s tough al­ways j ust talk­ing about him, but to be in a cat­e­gory with him, it means a lot.</p>
    <p>“And I know he’s look­ing down on us and cheer­ing us on, so we want to do it for him. Like I said, it’s an hon­our to be even men­tioned with his name.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers now have five more reg­u­lar-sea­son games be­fore the play-offs start and coach Frank Vo­gel will be us­ing the next seven days to tune-up their as­sault on the tro­phy.</p>
    <p>“If you’re win­ning enough games to se­cure the No. 1 seed, you’re build­ing the right habits that are go­ing to be nec­es­sary for you to win in the play­offs,” said Davis.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, we have big­ger as­pi­ra­tions than the No. 1 seed, but we are proud of the ac­com­plish­ment and we’ll en­joy it while we’re get­ting ready to get our group ready for the play-offs.”</p>
    <p>Team­mate LeBron James, who con­trib­uted 22 points and nine as­sists, said that it was the mark of a great player to be able to bounce back from a un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally poor night the pre­vi­ous game.</p>
    <p>Davis had a sea­son-low seven shot at­tempts, scor­ing just 14 points in a 107-92 loss to the Toronto Rap­tors on Sun­day, but proved that was just a one-off.</p>
    <p>James added: “When you are a great player, you learn from one game. You ad­just. And then you turn it into some­thing dif­fer­ent the next game, and he ab­so­lutely did that tonight.”</p>
    <p>In the other key games of the day, Fred VanVleet scored a ca­reer-high 36 points, lead­ing NBA cham­pi­ons Rap­tors to a 107-103 vic­tory over the Mi­ami Heat, while Joel Em­biid paced the Philadel­phia 76ers with 27 points en route to a 132-130 win against the San An­to­nio Spurs.</p>
