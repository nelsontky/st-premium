    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate Sarah Chua had been think­ing of get­ting a dog for a while. It was not un­til the cir­cuit breaker that the 22-year-old fi­nally adopted one.</p>
    <p>With her family home most of the time dur­ing that pe­riod – she lives with her par­ents and younger sis­ter – she found the op­por­tu­nity to talk to them about the adop­tion.</p>
    <p>In May, her family adopted a fiveyear-old Sin­ga­pore Spe­cial from dog shel­ter Ex­clu­sively Mon­grels. Ms Chua named her Tau Pok (fried bean­curd) be­cause of the colour of his fur and as she loves food.</p>
    <p>She says: “Life be­fore Tau Pok was mo­not­o­nous, es­pe­cially at the start of the cir­cuit breaker. I missed see­ing my friends and it was bor­ing tak­ing walks on my own.”</p>
    <p>An­i­mal wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tions tell The Sun­day Times more peo­ple have ex­pressed in­ter­est in adopt­ing or fos­ter­ing pets in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>With work-from-home ar­range­ments, new pet own­ers are bet­ter able to help the an­i­mals ad­just to their new homes and rou­tines.</p>
    <p>Oper­a­tions man­ager Jiny Mo­han­das has al­ways wanted a dog and, like Ms Chua, she adopted one dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old and her busi­ness an­a­lyst part­ner adopted a fouryear-old Sin­ga­pore Spe­cial from Causes for An­i­mals Sin­ga­pore in May.</p>
    <p>She says: “Hav­ing my part­ner work from home dur­ing this pe­riod helped the dog get ac­cus­tomed to our home and us to set­tle into a new rou­tine.”</p>
    <p>Com­pan­ion­ship is one rea­son for growing in­ter­est in pet own­er­ship dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dr Pauline Sim, 64, a con­sul­tant psy­chi­a­trist at Mount El­iz­a­beth Med­i­cal Cen­tre, says that cut off from so­cial con­tact, peo­ple feel iso­lated. Pets, es­pe­cially dogs and cats, make won­der­ful com­pan­ions, pro­vid­ing warmth and dis­trac­tion, she adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Colin Chew, 52, a vol­un­teer with Just For Paws, says en­quiries for adop­tion dou­bled dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. Since April, the pri­vately funded shel­ter has re­ceived 30 in­quiries and six dogs were adopted. Three dogs were adopted in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew says: “Pet own­er­ship is a long-term com­mit­ment. You have to be avail­able to care for the pet even if you have to go back to work in the of­fice.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lee Pin, co-founder of Chained Dog Aware­ness in Sin­ga­pore, a vol­un­teer-run ad­vo­cacy group which spe­cialises in help­ing dogs suf­fer­ing from con­fine­ment or teth­er­ing for long hours, agrees. Dur­ing the pan­demic, she says, more peo­ple re­alise that a pet can pro­vide com­pan­ion­ship and make their lives more ful­fill­ing, es­pe­cially when they give a home to an an­i­mal in need.</p>
    <p>But pan­demic or not, she adds, the usual rules of pet own­er­ship ap­ply, such as be­ing com­mit­ted to care for the an­i­mal.</p>
    <p>Free­lance lec­turer Theresa Huang, 37, adopted a chi­huahua on April 4, three days be­fore the cir­cuit breaker kicked in.</p>
    <p>She says the dog, Chewie, has been a source of com­fort, help­ing to stave off lone­li­ness when she missed family and friends. She lives with her hus­band, a 43-year-old sales man­ager, who sup­ported her de­ci­sion to adopt a dog.</p>
    <p>She says: “Peo­ple may think hav­ing a pet is to help ease your own lone­li­ness, but they also need our com­pany and care.”</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity man­ager Mi­hyun Chung, 28, who is from South Korea, adopted a seven-year-old Sin­ga­pore Spe­cial through Chained Dog Aware­ness last month.</p>
    <p>She says: “Like a lot of peo­ple, the pan­demic changed my lifestyle and daily rou­tine. It also pro­vided me with the in­spi­ra­tion for my new busi­ness idea, which af­forded me the time to take care of a dog.”</p>
    <p>She is in the midst of switch­ing to self-em­ploy­ment, which will al­low her more con­trol over her time.</p>
    <p>Com­pan­ion­ship was a key fac­tor for un­der­grad­u­ate Atiqah Ga­far, who lives alone, to adopt a pet last month. She chose a ham­ster as she finds it eas­ier to care for one than a cat. Her mother died of leukaemia last year and her fa­ther died 10 years ago.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old, who has four el­der sib­lings but chooses to live alone, says: “Most of my friends who have cats were puz­zled and amused when I said I wanted a ham­ster. They were also con­cerned that ham­sters have a short life­span. But deal­ing with the loss of my par­ents has made me stronger and more ac­cept­ing that peo­ple and an­i­mals will die one day.”</p>
    <p>Cat Wel­fare So­ci­ety pres­i­dent Thenuga Vi­jaku­mar, 35, has also no­ticed an in­crease in adop­tions.</p>
    <p>While it does not run a shel­ter, it fa­cil­i­tates adop­tions through its web­site and In­sta­gram ac­count. Based on the on­line posts, adop­tions are about 20 a month since phase two, com­pared with 10 to 15 be­fore the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Ms Vi­jaku­mar says: “I think peo­ple sim­ply had the time to fully con­sider all the re­quire­ments for adop­tion. For ex­am­ple, one re­quire­ment is to put mesh up around the house to en­sure the safety of the cat.</p>
    <p>“With work-from-home ar­range­ments, we found that peo­ple had more time to re­search and im­ple­ment these steps.”</p>
    <p>At Chained Dog Aware­ness, Ms Lee ob­serves a spike in the num­ber of peo­ple look­ing to adopt or fos­ter dogs since phase two, which started on June 19.</p>
    <p>In June, July and this month, the group re­ceived 20 such in­quiries – dou­ble the num­ber pre-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For those who can­not com­mit to car­ing for a pet in the long term, fos­ter­ing is an al­ter­na­tive to help an­i­mals in need.</p>
    <p>That was what Ms Sushma Soma, 33, did.</p>
    <p>Pre-Covid-19, the In­dian clas­si­cal vo­cal­ist reg­u­larly trav­elled to In­dia, Europe and the United States for train­ing and per­for­mances, which were cur­tailed when the pan­demic broke out.</p>
    <p>She fos­tered a dog through Chained Dog Aware­ness, car­ing for it from Aug 1 to 18 be­fore it found a po­ten­tial adopter.</p>
    <p>She says: “Fos­ter­ing al­lowed me to learn how to care for a dog and ease my feel­ings of un­cer­tainty over my job and the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“But the big­gest les­son from the ex­pe­ri­ence is learn­ing to let go and live in the present mo­ment.”</p>
