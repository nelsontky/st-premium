    <p>A 24-year-old woman, who was charged with the murder of her four-year-old daugh­ter, in­sisted on rais­ing the child on her own af­ter her di­vorce and then broke off con­tact with both her fam­ily and that of her former hus­band, said her brother-in-law.</p>
    <p>Foo Li Ping, 24, and Wong Shi Xiang, 33, are ac­cused of killing Foo’s daugh­ter Me­gan Khung Yu Wai, at a unit at Suites @ Guille­mard, a con­do­minium in Paya Le­bar, some time in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Shin Min Daily News yes­ter­day, the vic­tim’s un­cle – her fa­ther’s el­der brother – said Foo and his brother agreed to di­vorce af­ter be­ing mar­ried for more than a year ow­ing to ar­gu­ments over their daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>He added that Foo was adamant on rais­ing the child by her­self and her in-laws saw no rea­son to stop her.</p>
    <p>The child was around 18 to 19 months old at that time.</p>
    <p>“But af­ter she took her child away, she then moved in with her fam­ily and re­fused to let us see Me­gan,” said the man, who did not give his name.</p>
    <p>“(Two weeks ago, Foo’s) mother con­tacted my mother to say that she had not heard from Foo since last Septem­ber, when (Foo) moved out with Me­gan. That’s when we thought some­thing was wrong.”</p>
    <p>His brother and mother then made a po­lice re­port last Mon­day, the man said.</p>
    <p>The po­lice ear­lier said that they re­ceived a re­port last Mon­day that the four-year-old girl had gone miss­ing.</p>
    <p>They es­tab­lished that the girl had died and iden­ti­fied three sus­pects.</p>
    <p>Wong and Foo – who are un­der­stood to be a cou­ple – were charged with the murder on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The pair, along with another woman, Nou­velle Chua Ru­oshi, 30, have also been charged with dis­pos­ing of the body of the girl to hide what hap­pened to her.</p>
    <p>They were said to have in­ten­tion­ally dis­posed of her body by trans­port­ing it to Paya Ubi In­dus­trial Park and burn­ing it in a metal bar­rel.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese-lan­guage pa­per Lianhe Wan­bao, Wong used to work in a car ser­vic­ing workshop in Paya Ubi In­dus­trial Park.</p>
    <p>The owner of the workshop told Wan­bao that Wong worked there last year, but left not long af­ter.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim’s un­cle said the fam­ily was dev­as­tated by the un­ex­pected news of the vic­tim’s death.</p>
    <p>“I can­not imag­ine what they (the sus­pects) might have done to her,” he said.</p>
    <p>“She can do what­ever she wants with her life, but why did she have to take away the child too? If she had any prob­lems, she could have come to us. So why?”</p>
    <p>He added that, at this stage, the fam­ily is hop­ing to be able to ar­range a fu­neral for the girl as a form of clo­sure.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of murder with com­mon in­ten­tion face the death penalty.</p>
    <p>Those found guilty of dis­pos­ing of a corpse to pre­vent de­tec­tion of an of­fence with com­mon in­ten­tion can be jailed for up to seven years.</p>
    <p>FAM­ILY DEV­AS­TATED</p>
    <p>I can­not imag­ine what they (the sus­pects) might have done to her... She can do what­ever she wants with her life, but why did she have to take away the child too? If she had any prob­lems, she could ’’ have come to us. So why? UN­CLE of four-year-old vic­tim</p>
    <p>Me­gan Khung Yu Wai.</p>
