    <p>One of the best parts about run­ning is it is free and you can do it any­where. You just need a pair of run­ning shoes.</p>
    <p>Run­ning im­proves car­dio­vas­cu­lar fit­ness, fights age-re­lated cog­ni­tive de­cline, builds leg mus­cle and im­proves men­tal health.</p>
    <p>I see more peo­ple run­ning nowa­days – on con­crete pave­ments by the roads, on as­phalt-sur­faced park con­nec­tors and on stony trails at MacRitchie Reser­voir.</p>
    <p>With more runs go­ing vir­tual due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, race or­gan­is­ers are en­cour­ag­ing par­tic­i­pants to clock mileage on a tread­mill or out­doors on their own time.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, I tried a the­matic route in west­ern Sin­ga­pore de­signed for this year’s Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon.</p>
    <p>Iron­man Group, the marathon’s or­gan­iser, came up with the Vir­tual Rac­ing Se­ries – 28 routes rang­ing from 3km to 21km that runners can do in their own time to gear up for the grand fi­nale race from Nov 27 to Dec 6.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants can take one of the the­matic routes for the 10km, 21km or Dou­ble Up (10km and 21km) cat­e­gories dur­ing the grand fi­nale, or use a tread­mill.</p>
    <p>They have to fin­ish the cat­e­gory in a sin­gle run, but can do it in their own time dur­ing the race week. For the grand fi­nale race, they will be judged on their fin­ish­ing tim­ings, recorded via a track­ing app of their choice.</p>
    <p>The routes are cat­e­gorised ac­cord­ing to four themes cu­rated by the Iron­man Group and Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board. They take runners through places of ad­ven­ture, cul­tural land­marks, iconic at­trac­tions and food des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Flight stew­ard Paul Martin, 40, who ran on routes that took him to Changi Vil­lage, Labrador Park and Gar­dens by the Bay, says: “I love find­ing new places to ex­plore as an avid run­ner. I feel like a tourist in my own city on these routes.”</p>
    <p>I try one of the Cul­ture Shapers trails, kick­ing off from the en­trance at Jurong Lake Gar­dens near­est Lake­side MRT sta­tion. It takes me slightly over an hour to com­plete the 7km run.</p>
    <p>Run­ning solo is fairly dif­fer­ent from mass runs I have par­tic­i­pated in, such as the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Char­ity Run and The Mu­sic Run. Run­ning with oth­ers is more mo­ti­vat­ing, but there is more pres­sure to keep a con­sis­tent pace.</p>
    <p>Run­ning alone, on the other hand, al­lows me to con­cen­trate bet­ter on my form, pace and breath­ing.</p>
    <p>The route takes me to the park within Jurong Lake Gar­dens, on the stony ter­rain through the Al­lot­ment Gar­den and on the pave­ment along Cor­po­ra­tion Road which leads me back to Lake­side MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>There is no lack of scenic spots such as the White Rain­bow Bridge, Lone Tree, Al­sto­nia Is­land and Fresh­wa­ter Swamp For­est.</p>
    <p>These high­lights are mostly in the first half of the run and of­fer an in­ter­est­ing in­tro­duc­tion. At times, I strug­gle to keep my eyes on the path be­cause of the stun­ning panoramic views.</p>
    <p>For some­one who has lim­ited my run­ning to my Kal­lang neigh­bour­hood and East Coast Park, I feel my eyes have been opened to a whole new world.</p>
    <p>I also en­joy the two main types of ter­rain, both of which have pros and cons.</p>
    <p>Run­ning on the sturdy flat planes of board­walks and as­phalt is faster, com­pared with stony trails, which re­quire more con­cen­tra­tion due to the un­even sur­face. The trails also drain more en­ergy and i ncrease the risk of an­kle sprains as my stride changes through­out.</p>
    <p>Run­ning on con­crete pave­ments and as­phalt feels eas­ier on the feet be­cause there are few or no ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>But the down­side is it causes more stress to the knees due to repet­i­tive mo­tion as the feet usu­ally strikes the ground the same way through­out the run.</p>
    <p>What this run has ac­com­plished is it has di­verted me be­yond my usual routes and en­cour­aged me to go fur­ther to dis­cover more hid­den gems and new vis­tas.</p>
