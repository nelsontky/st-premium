    <p>LON­DON • The English Premier League (EPL) has can­celled its con­tract with Chi­nese broad­caster PPLive Sports In­ter­na­tional af­ter just one sea­son, the league said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The broad­caster, part of re­tail group Sun­ing, the owner of Serie A out­fit In­ter Mi­lan, paid around US$700 mil­lion (S$955.3 mil­lion) for three years of top-flight stream­ing rights from the 2019-20 sea­son.</p>
    <p>“The Premier League con­firms it has to­day ter­mi­nated its agree­ments for Premier League cov­er­age in China with its li­censee in that ter­ri­tory. The Premier League will not be com­ment­ing fur­ther on the mat­ter at this stage,” the league said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>There were some me­dia re­ports that the grow­ing po­lit­i­cal ten­sion be­tween the two coun­tries due to the on­go­ing Hong Kong protests, the of­fer of UK res­i­dency to up to three mil­lion res­i­dents and the black­list­ing of Huawei had led to the ax­ing of the deal.</p>
    <p>How­ever, league sources told The Guardian the rea­son was strictly fi­nan­cial.</p>
    <p>The Daily Mail was the first to break the story, say­ing last month that Sun­ing had with­held the £160 mil­lion (S$290 mil­lion) in­stal­ment due to the league in March.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment posted on its of­fi­cial Weibo ac­count, PPLive said it had tried to rene­go­ti­ate the price of the rights with the league, blam­ing the eco­nomic down­turn brought about by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has brought many chal­lenges, and it’s es­pe­cially ob­vi­ous dur­ing broad­cast­ing rights ne­go­ti­a­tions,” the state­ment said. “Af­ter rounds of meet­ings, PPLive Sports and the Premier League have a dis­agree­ment on the price of broad­cast­ing rights.</p>
    <p>“We re­gret that we couldn’t have an agree­ment with the Premier League. The di­rec­tion of PPLive Sports’ strate­gic de­vel­op­ment will not change.</p>
    <p>“Broad­cast­ing rights strat­egy ad­just­ment is based on ob­jec­tive re­al­ity and strate­gic think­ing. PPLive Sports will con­tinue to ded­i­cate it­self to pro­vid­ing high qual­ity ser­vices to fans, copy­right hold­ers and part­ners.”</p>
    <p>The deal with PPLive was struck dur­ing the peak of Chi­nese in­ter­est in in­ter­na­tional foot­ball and marked a huge in­crease in rev­enue on the previous deal.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing-based Su­per Sports Me­dia was the previous rights holder in China, with lo­cal me­dia re­ports sug­gest­ing it paid more than 1 bil­lion yuan (S$199.7 mil­lion) for a six-year deal un­til the end of the 2018-19 sea­son.</p>
    <p>The early end­ing of the PPLive deal is a fur­ther loss of in­come for clubs fol­low­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Ac­cord­ing to the Mail, the Premier League is aim­ing to re­turn to the Chi­nese mar­ket with the hope of ne­go­ti­at­ing a sim­i­lar deal with an­other broad­caster be­fore the new sea­son starts on Sept 12.</p>
