    <p>For 39 men and nine women, none of their loved ones may have known – or cared – about their deaths this year.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have ap­pealed for the next of kin to claim the bod­ies of 48 peo­ple so far this year, through no­tices posted on their web­site.</p>
    <p>Most of them were above 60 years old, and they died in places like hos­pi­tals, wel­fare homes for the des­ti­tute and in their own homes.</p>
    <p>But as sad as these in­ci­dents are, it is un­usual for se­niors in Sin­ga­pore to die alone and for their deaths to go un­de­tected for some time.</p>
    <p>Ms Sandy Goh, re­gional head of Touch Se­nior Ac­tiv­ity Cen­tre, said Touch hears of, at most, one or two cases a year.</p>
    <p>In rare cases, it hap­pens to the cen­tre’s clients. One was a wi­dow in her 70s who lived alone in a rental flat, but was vis­ited by her chil­dren fort­nightly.</p>
    <p>One day, three years ago, she did not show up at Touch’s se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tre as usual. When she did not pick up the phone, a Touch staff mem­ber went to her home that same day and found she had died of a heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh said: “For­tu­nately, we had the se­nior’s spare key as she had en­trusted us with it due to her his­tory of heart is­sues and stroke.”</p>
    <p>Lions Be­frien­ders chair­man An­thony Tay said the char­ity has seen only a hand­ful of such cases in its 25 years of op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) does not track the num­ber of deaths of el­derly in­di­vid­u­als where the bod­ies are un­de­tected for ex­tended pe­ri­ods of time, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said in re­sponse to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>While there is no of­fi­cial data on the num­ber of se­niors whose deaths go un­de­tected for some time, the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA), which runs the na­tional mor­tu­ary, said it han­dles be­tween 40 and 75 bod­ies that are not claimed by loved ones each year.</p>
    <p>These fig­ures are not even 0.5 per cent of the num­ber of deaths last year – about 21,500.</p>
    <p>If no one claims a body, the HSA works with the po­lice to con­firm the dead per­son’s iden­tity and de­ter­mine if there are next of kin who can claim the body.</p>
    <p>If there are no next of kin, the body may be re­leased un­der the Med­i­cal (Ther­apy, Ed­u­ca­tion and Re­search) Act, un­der which the di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices at MOH can au­tho­rise the body to be used for re­search, ther­apy or trans­plan­ta­tion, said the HSA spokesman.</p>
    <p>If not, an un­der­taker hired by the HSA will pre­pare the body for cre­ma­tion or burial, de­pend­ing on the per­son’s re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>Un­claimed cre­mated re­mains are kept for three years be­fore they are scat­tered at sea.</p>
    <p>REACH­ING OUT TO SE­NIORS</p>
    <p>So­cial ser­vice agen­cies like Touch Com­mu­nity Ser­vices and Lions Be­frien­ders run a suite of ser­vices to cater to the el­derly, in­clud­ing those who live alone.</p>
    <p>These ser­vices in­clude be­friend­ing, ac­tiv­i­ties for se­niors at cen­tres and meal de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Not only do staff and vol­un­teers from Touch and Lions Be­frien­ders visit vul­ner­a­ble se­niors at home and call them reg­u­larly, some se­nior vol­un­teers are also trained to be­friend and look out for neigh­bours who are more vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh said: “Very of­ten, these se­niors are the first line of de­fence as they live nearby, and can pro­vide timely and prac­ti­cal help in times of emer­gency.”</p>
    <p>There are also de­vices avail­able, such as a but­ton in their flats that se­niors can push to call for help.</p>
    <p>The Lions Be­frien­ders are con­duct­ing a pi­lot trial of the lat­est smart sen­sors in­stalled in se­niors’ homes to de­tect move­ment.</p>
    <p>If no move­ment is de­tected for 24 hours, alerts will be sent to check on the per­son.</p>
    <p>This project, which started in Septem­ber, comes af­ter an ear­lier ver­sion of the sen­sors was de­ployed in 2013.</p>
    <p>The char­ity is also pi­lot­ing an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence auto-re­ply mes­sag­ing app that sends mes­sages or makes calls to se­niors ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>If there is no re­sponse from the se­nior af­ter a cer­tain num­ber of tries, his care­givers are alerted to check on him.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said that this re­duces the num­ber of hours a se­nior may go un­de­tected af­ter death or a fall.</p>
    <p>“Many el­derly say they feel safer and less wor­ried now there is... a sys­tem that will be able to get them help when needed,” he said.</p>
    <p>FREE FU­NER­ALS</p>
    <p>Then there are also char­i­ties like Cheng Hong Wel­fare Ser­vice So­ci­ety and Nam Hong Wel­fare Ser­vice So­ci­ety that pro­vide free fu­ner­als for needy se­niors who have re­quested that they con­duct their last rites.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of last rites of­ten weighs on the minds of se­niors who may be sin­gle or es­tranged from their fam­i­lies, said rep­re­sen­ta­tives of both char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Cheng Hong Wel­fare Ser­vice So­ci­ety con­ducts about 70 such fu­ner­als a year.</p>
    <p>It also runs a 24-hour hot­line for its free fu­neral ser­vice, called Af­ter­life Memo­rial Ser­vice, but se­niors can call the so­ci­ety too if they are lonely or need sup­port, said its chair­man Lim Hang Chung.</p>
    <p>Its vol­un­teers also visit and be­friend lonely se­niors.</p>
    <p>Cheng Hong’s staff try to per­suade the dead per­son’s loved ones to at­tend the fu­neral, de­spite pos­si­bly strained fam­ily ties. More of­ten than not, fam­ily mem­bers will be present to bid the per­son farewell, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>Nam Hong Wel­fare Ser­vice So­ci­ety con­ducts a hand­ful of free fu­ner­als a year for the se­niors who have en­trusted the task to the char­ity.</p>
    <p>Its gen­eral man­ager, Mr Lok Aik Hwa, said: “Most of them have a sad story, like they are es­tranged from their fam­i­lies. Peo­ple only turn to a third party like us to ar­range their fu­neral when they feel they have no choice.”</p>
    <p>MORE SE­NIORS LIV­ING ALONE</p>
    <p>As the pop­u­la­tion ages, more se­niors in Sin­ga­pore are liv­ing alone, mak­ing the is­sue of un­de­tected deaths a real con­cern.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Pop­u­la­tion Trends 2020 re­port, of the res­i­dent house­holds last year that had heads of the house­hold aged 65 and above, 22.9 per cent were peo­ple liv­ing alone. This is an in­crease from the 16.6 per cent in 2009.</p>
    <p>But while there is a range of ser­vices and pro­grammes to cater to se­niors liv­ing alone, those in­ter­viewed note that there is noth­ing they can do if a se­nior does not want to en­gage with oth­ers or re­ceive help.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, un­de­tected deaths can be avoided if more peo­ple reach out to their neigh­bours who are liv­ing alone or who may be des­ti­tute, said Ang Chin Moh Fu­neral Di­rec­tors’ deputy chair­man Ang Ziqian.</p>
    <p>The com­pany pro­vides free fu­ner­als for the des­ti­tute.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang said: “Our mind­set of it be­ing none of our busi­ness has to change. A friendly ‘hello, how are you’ can help de­ter­mine if this per­son needs help.</p>
    <p>“In do­ing this, Sin­ga­pore­ans can help pre­vent these kinds of deaths in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
