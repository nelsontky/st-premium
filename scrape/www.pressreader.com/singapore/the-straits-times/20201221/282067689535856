    <p>Malls in Sin­ga­pore were teem­ing with pre-pan­demic crowd sizes on the fi­nal week­end be­fore Christ­mas as shop­pers sought last­minute presents in a fes­tive yearend mood.</p>
    <p>This was de­spite the Gov­ern­ment urg­ing cau­tion in the lead-up to phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing on Dec 28, which will al­low larger gath­er­ings of up to eight and ex­panded ca­pac­ity lim­its at pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times spoke to sev­eral pa­trons at shop­ping cen­tres around the is­land, who ad­mit­ted to un­ease over the lack of safe dis­tanc­ing amid crowds larger than they had ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“It’s very busy in the mall. It’s scary to see peo­ple go­ing out like there’s (no pan­demic),” said Mr Muham­mad Faiz, 23, at Bugis Junc­tion. He usu­ally heads out to town only once a month.</p>
    <p>House­wife Aisyah Da­man, 30, said: “It seems like peo­ple are be­hav­ing as if we are al­ready in phase three.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has warned against com­pla­cency dur­ing the fes­tive sea­son, with Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong not­ing last Mon­day the con­cern that “there will be groups of peo­ple who let their guard down”. Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong also urged peo­ple not to imag­ine “that the prob­lem has dis­ap­peared”.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day af­ter­noon, even as it was re­vealed that 13 peo­ple on stay-home no­tice at the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel might have been in­fected there, malls in the area were packed.</p>
    <p>At Ion Or­chard, queues of about 20 formed out­side re­tail­ers JD Sports and Muji.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers thronged Daiso with bas­kets full of Christ­mas goods. Ms Gwee, 33, a health­care pro­fes­sional who de­clined to give her first name, changed her mind on step­ping into the va­ri­ety store.</p>
    <p>“I was turned off by the num­ber of peo­ple,” she said. “It was so crowded it felt like the air-con wasn’t on.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar crowds were seen at 313@som­er­set but they had lit­tle ef­fect on a 29-year-old who wanted to be known only as Serene. “There are so many rea­sons to be out – sales, the fes­tive mood, meet­ing friends,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I’m not wor­ried… And we are go­ing to phase three soon.”</p>
    <p>At Bugis, with re­tail staff say­ing they had seen an in­crease in foot­fall and sales over the past two week­ends, it was dif­fi­cult for shop­pers to stay 1m apart in some spots, though most seemed mind­ful of the need to do so.</p>
    <p>Out­side Toys ‘R’ Us at VivoCity, Ms Asikin Said, 35, told ST she typ­i­cally shops on­line but with de­liv­er­ies af­fected by the hol­i­day sea­son, she de­cided to take her three-yearold son out to brave the crowds.</p>
    <p>Even with the crowd spread out across the mall, she said she had had enough. “It’s quite bad. We’re go­ing home right af­ter this.”</p>
    <p>Ms Aisyah, who was at Bugis with her fam­ily, ac­knowl­edged she did not feel 100 per cent safe.</p>
    <p>“But... we are will­ing to take the risk, as long as we en­sure that we prac­tise good hy­giene and wear our masks prop­erly. I’m also mak­ing sure my 10-month-old daugh­ter doesn’t touch things.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has said it will con­tinue to de­ploy safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and work with re­tail­ers to bet­ter man­age crowds.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, these am­bas­sadors were spot­ted, spar­ingly, at some malls ST vis­ited.</p>
    <p>At VivoCity and Bugis Junc­tion, reg­u­lar an­nounce­ments were played over the pub­lic ad­dress sys­tem, re­quest­ing peo­ple to keep a safe dis­tance, among other Covid-19 pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Jenny Khoo, Sin­ga­pore head of as­set op­er­a­tions for the Lendlease group man­ag­ing malls like 313 and JEM: “Our malls will con­tinue to carry out an en­hanced clean­ing regime and im­ple­ment crowd man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Ms Aqi­lah Salahudin, a sales as­sis­tant at Typo in Bugis, said foot­fall was ex­pected to re­main heavy, with schools re­open­ing and Chi­nese New Year com­ing up.</p>
    <p>She has been re­mind­ing cus­tomers to keep a safe dis­tance from one an­other. “(With) Covid-19, some­times you don’t know what could hap­pen… But we have to deal with the risk.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has warned against com­pla­cency dur­ing the fes­tive sea­son, with Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong not­ing last Mon­day the con­cern that “there will be groups of peo­ple who let their guard down”. Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Lee Hsien Loong also urged peo­ple not to imag­ine</p>
    <p>“that the prob­lem has dis­ap­peared”.</p>
    <p>Eater­ies are gear­ing up for the fes­tive sea­son by im­ple­ment­ing a host of mea­sures that will help them ac­com­mo­date cus­tomers in a safe way amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Some restau­rants are hir­ing more staff to en­sure that cus­tomers ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sures, while oth­ers are putting up more vis­ual re­minders, such as posters, about Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent rules that will re­main in ef­fect un­til Sun­day, so­cial gath­er­ings in groups of more than five are not al­lowed out­side an in­di­vid­ual’s res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets are not per­mit­ted to ac­cept book­ings from groups that are larger than five, even if such groups are split across mul­ti­ple ta­bles. Groups are not al­lowed to in­ter­min­gle.</p>
    <p>From Dec 28, when phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing kicks in, peo­ple will be al­lowed to meet in groups of up to eight for so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants are tak­ing steps to en­sure that cus­tomers do not let their guard down be­fore phase three be­gins, even as they make merry dur­ing the fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>Mr G. Shan­mugam, owner of Bot­toms Up restau­rant in Telok Ayer, said he will be ac­cept­ing fewer reser­va­tions over the next two weeks to en­sure that cus­tomers do not try to flout the rules by mak­ing sep­a­rate reser­va­tions and then min­gle across ta­bles on site.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephane Heard, vice-pres­i­dent of F&B op­er­a­tions at Como Dempsey, which op­er­ates six restau­rants in the Dempsey area, said it has hired more part-time staff to help man­age the large crowds ex­pected on Christ­mas Day.</p>
    <p>All these mea­sures are on top of ex­ist­ing ones in place since June, say those in­ter­viewed.</p>
    <p>But while busi­nesses take steps to en­sure the rules are ad­hered to, they are also seek­ing co­op­er­a­tion from cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Mr Wei Chan, hon­orary sec­re­tary of the Restau­rant As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, said the penal­ties for in­di­vid­u­als pale in com­par­i­son to the costs borne by es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als who flout safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will be fined $300 for the first of­fence.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses, how­ever, will be fined and forced to close tem­po­rar­ily, Mr Chan said, cit­ing the Seoul Gar­den out­let at Tampines Mall which had to sus­pend full op­er­a­tions for 10 days for fail­ing to com­ply with Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>A 32-year-old ser­vice en­gi­neer had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 af­ter hav­ing din­ner with 12 fam­ily mem­bers at the Seoul Gar­den out­let on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing forced to close dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod will hurt es­tab­lish­ments badly,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment said on Fri­day that there will be more checks on F&B out­lets to make sure that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are be­ing com­plied with. The stepped-up sur­veil­lance will ex­tend over the next few weeks to cover the end-of-year fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong Tien Teck, an em­ployee at seafood restau­rant Momma Kong’s, saw safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors walk by the Mosque Street es­tab­lish­ment thrice on Satur­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>“They usu­ally take a look at the (in­te­rior) of the restau­rant from out­side, and then give a thumbs up be­fore walk­ing away,” he added.</p>
    <p>A check with sev­eral restau­rants in the Chi­na­town area re­vealed that the am­bas­sadors usu­ally con­duct checks in the area twice a day.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral restau­rant staff said that the crowds were not sig­nif­i­cantly larger as they are still deal­ing with the lack of tourists.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, queues were seen form­ing out­side a few eater­ies in Chi­na­town and Tan­jong Pa­gar, with pa­trons keep­ing a safe dis­tance from other groups in spite of the lim­ited pave­ment space out­side the restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a sep­a­rate event on Satur­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Amy Khor said it is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore­ans to re­alise that Covid-19 is still around.</p>
    <p>“We can­not af­ford to let our guard down. Go­ing into phase three still means we have to main­tain vig­i­lance,” she told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Soft­ware en­gi­neer Im­ran Hamid, 32, said: “It has been more crowded over the last few weeks since the school hol­i­days started, so I think it’s good that there are go­ing to be more strin­gent checks dur­ing this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Mr James Je­su­vhass, 70, a re­tired gen­eral man­ager in the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor, said he would have pre­ferred phase three to be im­ple­mented be­fore Christ­mas since it is likely that peo­ple would hold New Year cel­e­bra­tions early.</p>
    <p>Pri­vacy con­sul­tant Wil­liam Lim, 53, said peo­ple here are used to the phased ap­proach to re­open­ing, a strat­egy that he said has yielded suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment took many steps to en­sure things are okay, and just look at how we have im­proved com­pared with other coun­tries,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms An­nie Huang, 46, a pri­vate tu­tor and mother of two, said phase three gives larger fam­i­lies the op­por­tu­nity to meet up be­fore the new school year be­gins.</p>
    <p>Her chil­dren are look­ing for­ward to go­ing out for a meal with their cousins.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent rules that will re­main in ef­fect un­til Sun­day, so­cial gath­er­ings in groups of more than five are not al­lowed out­side an in­di­vid­ual’s res­i­dence.</p>
