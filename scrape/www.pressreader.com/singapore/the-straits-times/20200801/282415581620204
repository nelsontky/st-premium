    <p>• Ar­se­nal’s Emil­iano Martinez has a point to prove in to­day’s FA Cup fi­nal against Chelsea as he looks to shake off the tag of backup goal­keeper, a ti­tle he has held since join­ing the club’s academy in 2010.</p>
    <p>Un­til first-choice stop­per Bernd Leno suf­fered a sea­son-end­ing knee in­jury against Brighton in June, the Ar­gen­tinian had not made a sin­gle Premier League ap­pear­ance for the Gun­ners since the 2016-17 sea­son.</p>
    <p>But Martinez has im­pressed in the Ger­man’s ab­sence, keep­ing four clean sheets in 10 starts, and he is de­ter­mined to show at Wem­b­ley that he can chal­lenge Leno in the long term.</p>
    <p>The game against Chelsea will pro­vide a stern test of his cre­den­tials, but the 27-year-old is look­ing for­ward to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal will not only be the cul­mi­na­tion of a long jour­ney to reach the top, but he is also aware that win­ning the tro­phy and seal­ing a Europa League spot will be cru­cial in at­tract­ing new faces to the Emi­rates dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>Chelsea have al­ready qual­i­fied for the Cham­pi­ons League via fin­ish­ing fourth i n the Premier League, while Ar­se­nal can play in the Europa League next sea­son if they lift the Cup.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple say, ‘10 years you never played.’ It’s not (true). It’s never played for Ar­se­nal,” he said. “But I played and I dealt with a lot of frus­tra­tion on loan (spells at six dif­fer­ent clubs), and it made me the man and the player that I am to­day.</p>
    <p>“In foot­ball, ev­ery­thing changes and now I am fin­ish­ing the sea­son play­ing ev­ery game. But it’s not over – I need to win that tro­phy.</p>
    <p>“You know that if you play in the Europa League next sea­son, it is an­other way to qual­ify for the Cham­pi­ons League. We want to play in Europe. We want it more than them. That’s the re­al­ity. That might be a big part in the fi­nal.”</p>
    <p>He will not be the only backup goal­keeper tak­ing cen­tre stage to­day as com­pa­triot Willy Ca­ballero looks set to start in be­tween the sticks for the Blues.</p>
    <p>While Chelsea boss Frank Lam­pard re­fused to con­firm his No. 1 pick, he all but hinted Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga – the world’s most ex­pen­sive goal­keeper – would be dropped af­ter a string of un­con­vinc­ing dis­plays since the Premier League’s restart in June.</p>
    <p>At his pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, he said: “Dif­fi­cult be­cause we have com­pe­ti­tion in the squad.</p>
    <p>“I have changed it at times, we con­sider the games as we go. I know how much play­ers want to be in these games. Peo­ple off the bench have made a huge dif­fer­ence in re­cent games.”</p>
