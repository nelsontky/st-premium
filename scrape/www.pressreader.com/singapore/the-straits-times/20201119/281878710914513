    <p>It is too early to ex­pect the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to se­ri­ously relook Amer­i­can poli­cies in Asia. Do­mes­tic con­cerns will be para­mount – the pan­demic and eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Yet, with less than full at­ten­tion on de­vel­op­ments in Asia, there is a dan­ger that mis­per­cep­tions could arise. Look at how the Asean Sum­mit, which ended last week, has been re­ported on, es­pe­cially the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP). This is a new trade and eco­nomic deal that will cover 2.2 bil­lion peo­ple and most of East Asia. Yet more than a few over­seas me­dia re­ported that it is led, and even dom­i­nated, by China.</p>
    <p>Per­haps such a view plays con­ve­niently into the nar­ra­tive of Sino-Amer­i­can con­flict.</p>
    <p>Yet that is wrong. What is right is more complex but es­sen­tial to un­der­stand. Be­gin by un­der­stand­ing that not ev­ery­thing is about China.</p>
    <p>EIGHT YEARS OF TALKS</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions on RCEP lasted for over eight years, en­dur­ing many rounds of bar­gain­ing and meet­ing de­lays. Even be­fore that, it was Asean that acted to craft a frame­work of prin­ci­ples to guide the process for­ward with its other part­ners. This prior prepa­ra­tion by Asean and the long and chal­leng­ing path shows that RCEP was never the case of China or any sin­gle coun­try dic­tat­ing terms.</p>
    <p>Con­sider its broad and in­clu­sive mem­ber­ship. Ja­pan and South Korea are mem­bers, with their own pro­duc­tion chains across the re­gion – and they are now trend­ing to link more to Asean, rather than to China.</p>
    <p>The same is true for Aus­tralia and New Zealand. Altogether, count up the num­ber of United States al­lies and friends in the group, and ask why they might agree to any­thing de­signed to be dom­i­nated by China. What has driven RCEP is eco­nomic logic and busi­ness op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>High trade vol­umes af­firm that strong eco­nomic in­ter­de­pen­den­cies al­ready ex­ist among these economies – ac­count­ing for 28 per cent of global trade. The agree­ment will make in­ter­con­nec­tions more seam­less in pref­er­ences and rules of ori­gin, to fur­ther fa­cil­i­tate the flow of in­ter­me­di­ate com­po­nents as well as fi­nal prod­ucts. That con­nec­tiv­ity is also sup­ported by pro­vi­sions for im­proved Cus­toms pro­ce­dures and trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other ben­e­fit is to pro­vide ar­range­ments among the North-east Asian trio of China, Ja­pan and South Korea. A tri­lat­eral free trade agree­ment has been in­ter­mit­tently dis­cussed since 2007, but with­out com­ple­tion. Un­til that might be agreed on, RCEP will serve to link the three – no easy achieve­ment, given his­tor­i­cal and on­go­ing ten­sions and ri­val­ries.</p>
    <p>A third achieve­ment is clear­est when we look at the grow­ing pro­tec­tion­ist sen­ti­ment. With world trade slow­ing in vol­ume and value and the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) un­der scru­tiny, RCEP stands out as an ex­cep­tion. Asia is com­ing to­gether and RCEP can help the re­gion’s re­cov­ery from the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>WHO’S IN OR OUT</p>
    <p>It is not China which is at the cen­tre of RCEP, but Asean that ini­ti­ated and chaired ne­go­ti­a­tions. Even be­fore the agree­ment, Asean had trade pacts with all key re­gional part­ners. In­deed, RCEP be­gan with the in­ten­tion to con­sol­i­date those dif­fer­ent Asean-cen­tric agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Many struggle to un­der­stand how this group of 10 medium- and smaller-sized coun­tries of­fers lead­er­ship with­out the heft of larger economies like China or Ja­pan. A slew of re­cent books by some Western ob­servers sug­gest that some Asean mem­bers are dom­i­nated by Bei­jing. Yet Asean con­tin­ues to be cen­tral for many in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Its long-term part­ner­ship with Ja­pan was re­in­forced dur­ing prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s years in of­fice and new Premier Yoshi­hide Suga made it a point to head first to In­done­sia and Viet­nam, two key Asean mem­bers. Sim­i­larly, South Korea has its New South­ern Pol­icy, and in­tra-Asean eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion is also pro­ceed­ing.</p>
    <p>While far from per­fect, Asean has played a cen­tral role in the wider re­gion with its East Asia Sum­mit for lead­ers, and meet­ings for for­eign and de­fence min­is­ters. In this con­text, RCEP is no aber­ra­tion but an­other ex­am­ple of how Asean has con­sis­tently pushed re­gion­al­i­sa­tion for­ward. As Asean sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lim Jock Hoi noted, the agree­ment “un­der­pins Asean’s role in lead­ing a mul­ti­lat­eral trade agree­ment of this mag­ni­tude, de­spite global and re­gional chal­lenges”.</p>
    <p>There are lim­its to Asean’s lead­er­ship and in­flu­ence that must be man­aged. Con­sider how In­dia has fi­nally de­cided to stay out of RCEP, after so many rounds of ne­go­ti­a­tions. Yet the South Asian gi­ant is wel­come to con­tinue as an ob­server with the ex­plicit op­tion to join as a full mem­ber. There is also scope to bring other economies on board, if will­ing.</p>
    <p>The US re­mains ab­sent. It was never in­tended that the US would join RCEP, as the coun­try has never had an agree­ment with Asean. In­stead, the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s strat­egy was to push its Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship to set the high­est stan­dards to lift eco­nomic ties and strate­gic en­gage­ment across the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>The US has only Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to blame for of­fer­ing no al­ter­na­tive. After he aban­doned the Obama ini­tia­tive, 11 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Asian friends like Ja­pan, Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam, con­tin­ued with the re­named Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP).</p>
    <p>Add to this Mr Trump’s ab­sence from the an­nual East Asia Sum­mit – hosted by Asean – since 2018. When the US has come calling, it is usu­ally to ramp up anti-China rhetoric, as ex­em­pli­fied by Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s most re­cent five-na­tion visit to Asia. RCEP shows the lim­its of in­con­sis­tent and one-is­sue en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEXT</p>
    <p>It is a dif­fi­cult time for glob­al­i­sa­tion and eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion. The in­sti­tu­tions and rules for in­ter­na­tional trade are un­der at­tack at dif­fer­ent lev­els – from do­mes­tic pro­tec­tion­ist sen­ti­ments to great pow­ers break­ing rules and us­ing trade to pun­ish oth­ers, and the squab­bling in the WTO. RCEP is not a panacea to all ills.</p>
    <p>Most ac­knowl­edge that while the agree­ment is a good base­line, RCEP commitment­s are not as deep or as far-reach­ing as those in the CPTPP. But RCEP serves a much more di­verse ar­ray of mem­bers, from large to small, and from ad­vanced economies to those still emerg­ing into the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>RCEP sup­ports the rules of global trade and in­vest­ment and can play an im­por­tant role in build­ing up re­silience in the re­gional econ­omy. Sig­na­tory gov­ern­ments can max­imise those ben­e­fits with quick rat­i­fi­ca­tions and by shar­ing in­for­ma­tion with busi­nesses widely, reach­ing not only the big play­ers but even the small and medium en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>In­dia may yet join RCEP and the US can well con­sider new ways to engage the re­gion, when ready, and per­haps in ar­eas of the dig­i­tal econ­omy. But those out­side can­not sim­ply gain­say the RCEP, and ex­pect oth­ers in the re­gion not to move ahead on what makes sense for them.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is forc­ing coun­tries to re­think path­ways to pros­per­ity. In ad­di­tion to RCEP, a com­pre­hen­sive re­cov­ery frame­work and im­ple­men­ta­tion plan to ad­dress health and eco­nomic im­pacts from the pan­demic was also launched at the Asean Sum­mit.</p>
    <p>The fu­ture in the re­gion can­not stand still for any­one. In tan­dem with re­cov­ery ef­forts, what</p>
    <p>Asean and other part­ners of­fer in RCEP are next steps that em­pha­sise mul­ti­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion with an ap­pro­pri­ately in­clu­sive recog­ni­tion of di­ver­si­ties. That is a fu­ture that may well be worth hav­ing.</p>
