    <p>Asian share mar­kets mostly rose yes­ter­day as global in­vestors ap­plauded suc­cess­ful trial data for a coro­n­avirus vac­cine, al­though ex­pected de­lays to any mass roll-out took the gloss off early gains.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive tone in Asian eq­ui­ties came af­ter Pfizer said its Covid-19 vac­cine, de­vel­oped with Ger­man part­ner BioN­Tech, was more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing in­fec­tion, mark­ing the first suc­cess­ful re­sults from a largescale clin­i­cal trial.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor Asian mar­kets soared on the vac­cine news be­fore weak­en­ing later in the ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Straits Times In­dex gained 3.67 per cent to take it to its high­est point since June.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 ended up nearly 0.3 per cent af­ter touch­ing a 29-year high in ear­lier trad­ing.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.66 per cent higher while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex rose 1.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>De­spite the op­ti­mistic tone, there was some weak­ness in China, with the CSI300 In­dex slip­ping 0.17 per cent. An­a­lysts at­trib­uted the de­cline to the heavy ex­po­sure of China’s in­dexes to tech stocks, which came un­der pres­sure as in­vestors eyed less con­sumer re­liance on tech­nol­ogy if a vac­cine leads to an eas­ing of move­ment re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>MSCI’s broad­est in­dex of Asia-Pa­cific shares out­side Ja­pan was 0.1 per cent higher.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket is look­ing for­ward to a more sus­tained so­lu­tion to the pan­demic and that is why we have seen such a sharp re­ac­tion,” said Mr Tai Hui, chief Asia mar­ket strate­gist at JPMor­gan As­set Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>But he sounded cau­tion over the speed in which the vac­cine could be im­ple­mented, “given more tests are needed, then the ap­proval process”. “Man­u­fac­tur­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion would mean the vac­cine, if truly ef­fec­tive, is still months away from mass de­ploy­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>The eq­ui­ties op­ti­mism was not shared across all as­set classes. Oil prices slipped in Asian trade af­ter post­ing the big­gest one-day per­cent­age gain in five months.</p>
    <p>Air­line, travel and tourism stocks across Asia were ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the pos­i­tive sen­ti­ment from the vac­cine an­nounce­ment and held their gains while the broader in­dexes weak­ened in the af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>“No sur­prises but it’s es­sen­tially a ro­ta­tion... What was bought in the last eight months is now be­ing sold and what was sold is be­ing bought,” said Cit­i­group global mar­kets direc­tor El­iz­a­beth Tian.</p>
    <p>Qan­tas Air­ways closed 8.3 per cent higher to hit its high­est level since March, Ja­pan Air­lines shot 20.6 per cent higher and ANA Hold­ings rose 17.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways shares jumped 13 per cent, the best since July.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines jumped 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Mar­kets will get ahead of them­selves in the short term with the vac­cine news, but longer term it feels like it is go­ing higher,” Ord Min­nett ad­viser John Mil­roy said from Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>On Wall Street, fu­tures on the Nas­daq 100 slumped 1.5 per cent, while con­tracts on the Rus­sell 2000 rose al­most 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine news also sent long­dated US Trea­sury yields hit­ting their big­gest one-day jump since March. The yield curve, an in­di­ca­tion of risk ap­petite, hit its steep­est level since that month.</p>
