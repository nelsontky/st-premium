    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Adam San­dler is up for mak­ing another movie with fre­quent co-star Drew Bar­ry­more.</p>
    <p>The duo, both 45, have starred to­gether in hit films The Wed­ding Singer (1998), 50 First Dates (2004) and Blended (2014).</p>
    <p>When asked if he would be open to the idea of film­ing another movie with Bar­ry­more in an in­ter­view with En­ter­tain­ment Tonight (ET), San­dler said, “of course”.</p>
    <p>“Any time Drew wants to, she’s got to tell me and then I’ll do it,” he said. “But now she’s busy with that show... I love her on the show.”</p>
    <p>Bar­ry­more is helm­ing a new talk show, The Drew Bar­ry­more Show, for which San­dler al­ready helped recre­ate a scene from 50 First Dates dur­ing the pre­miere in the mid­dle of this month.</p>
    <p>San­dler was all praise for Bar­ry­more’s abil­ity to draw out the best in her guests. He said: “(She) just knows how to talk to you make you say, ‘Hmmm, maybe I’ll dis­cuss this with you’. I al­ways open up when I talk to Drew. She’s go­ing to do that with the whole world.</p>
    <p>“She’s cool, solid as rock, just like she is in real life.” San­dler will next be seen in up­com­ing Net­flix comedy film Hu­bie Hal­loween along­side Modern Fam­ily ac­tress Julie Bowen.</p>
    <p>They starred to­gether in another San­dler hit flick, Happy Gil­more, back in 1996.</p>
    <p>“It was just nice to be with her again,” he told ET. “Back in Happy Gil­more, we were both like, ‘Oh my God, we’re mak­ing a movie, this is in­sane’. I think with this one we were able to make the movie and also talk about other stuff.”</p>
