    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) is re­open­ing ap­pli­ca­tions for its fund meant to as­sist mem­bers af­fected by the Covid-19 pandemic by pro­vid­ing them with cash re­lief of up to $300. It is also ex­pand­ing the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria for ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the fund.</p>
    <p>The en­hanced NTUC Care Fund (Covid-19) will use the re­main­ing $17 mil­lion of the ini­tial $25 mil­lion set aside for it, NTUC said yesterday.</p>
    <p>The first ex­er­cise, which opened for ap­pli­ca­tions from March 25 to Sept 30, sup­ported about 30,000 union mem­bers with a to­tal pay­out of about $8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>About 65,000 union mem­bers are ex­pected to ben­e­fit from these one-off pay­outs rang­ing from $50 to $300.</p>
    <p>Among the cri­te­ria re­vi­sions is an in­crease in the cap on ap­pli­cants’ gross monthly per­sonal in­come (GPI). Those who have re­ceived re­trench­ment ben­e­fits of more than $6,500 are also now al­lowed to ap­ply.</p>
    <p>Those stay­ing with de­pen­dants in the same house­hold and whose monthly GPI is no more than $4,500, and mem­bers with­out de­pen­dants stay­ing in the same house­hold with a monthly GPI of up to $1,600, are now el­i­gi­ble to ap­ply to the fund for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als whose salary and em­ploy­ment have been af­fected be­cause of Covid-19-re­lated rea­sons can also ap­ply. More de­tails are on the NTUC web­site.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the en­hanced as­sis­tance pro­gramme will open from Nov 23 to Feb 28.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants who were suc­cess­ful and those who were not during the first round of ap­pli­ca­tions can ap­ply again for a pay­out, if their union mem­ber­ship is still valid. They will be no­ti­fied through SMS.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers who ap­plied suc­cess­fully in the first round will re­ceive their pay­outs by early next month.</p>
    <p>New mem­bers are re­quired to have a min­i­mum of one-month paid mem­ber­ship fees be­fore a pay­out is made.</p>
    <p>NTUC also an­nounced that its an­nual Back to School Fair will take place vir­tu­ally from Dec 7 to Jan 7. The month-long event fea­tures pro­mo­tions and dis­counts on school-re­lated items.</p>
    <p>Laud­ing the two pro­grammes, NTUC sec­re­tary-general Ng Chee Meng said: “To­gether with job and em­ploy­ment sup­port that we con­tinue to of­fer mem­bers, I am cer­tain we can all emerge stronger out of this cri­sis, to­wards the new nor­mal.”</p>
