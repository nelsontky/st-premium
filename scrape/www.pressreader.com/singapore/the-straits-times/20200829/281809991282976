    <p>It was smooth sail­ing for the first batch of China-bound pas­sen­gers leav­ing Changi Air­port yes­ter­day, af­ter the Chi­nese Em­bassy in Sin­ga­pore i mposed stricter re­quire­ments on trav­ellers fly­ing to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>All 47 trav­ellers on Air China Flight CA 768 to Hangzhou at 4.18pm had the nec­es­sary pa­per­work and no one was turned away from board­ing.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Em­bassy last week said that start­ing yes­ter­day, peo­ple trav­el­ling from Sin­ga­pore to China must take a Covid-19 test within five days be­fore their flight and test neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>It did not des­ig­nate spe­cific in­sti­tu­tions where the test can be taken, but said trav­ellers can choose any hospi­tal or clinic listed on the Health Min­istry’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Among those fly­ing to China yes­ter­day was Sin­ga­porean Michelle Liew, 56, who was trav­el­ling for busi­ness as well as per­sonal rea­sons. Her hus­band – an Aus­tralian who is a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent – went to China on a busi­ness trip in Fe­bru­ary and has been stuck there since. The cou­ple run a tech­nol­ogy and re­search firm to­gether.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Liew: “This is pri­mar­ily a busi­ness trip, but it is also a re­union for us. (The emo­tional fac­tor) is that I re­ally want to see my hus­band.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the lat­est Chi­nese Em­bassy rules, pas­sen­gers who test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 must e-mail their test re­sult to the em­bassy, to­gether with a scanned copy of a signed health dec­la­ra­tion form and a pho­to­copy of the bio page of their pass­port. It will take at least one work­ing day to ver­ify the doc­u­ments. More de­tails can be found on the em­bassy’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Dr Liew said she was able to book a slot to take the swab test at a Raf­fles Med­i­cal clinic in Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3. “It was a bit of a rush when they in­formed us of the new mea­sures last week and time was very tight... but the clinic’s ser­vice was pro­fes­sional and it was very smooth,” she said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese na­tional Cui Li Qing, 42, said he was in a rush to get home due to a fam­ily emer­gency. Mr Cui, who works in the con­struc­tion sec­tor and has been in Sin­ga­pore for about three years, said his com­pany paid for his Covid-19 swab test.</p>
    <p>Ms Zhang Yan, 38, also a Chi­nese na­tional, said her com­pany not only paid for her swab test but also for her plane ticket home. She was at the air­port with a for­mer col­league, Ms Tang Yun, 20.</p>
    <p>Ms Zhang was work­ing at lo­cal food chain Old Chang Kee for the last six years, and just left her job to re­turn to China for good.</p>
    <p>She said in Man­darin: “I’m very grate­ful that Old Chang Kee made th­ese ar­range­ments... I was wor­ried that I would not be able to board this flight for what­ever rea­son, or that they would can­cel the flight. But now I’m here, I’m very re­lieved.”</p>
    <p>Some pas­sen­gers took their own safety pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>A 26-year-old for­mer re­searcher from the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore turned up at the air­port yes­ter­day decked out in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, com­plete with gog­gles and la­tex gloves.</p>
    <p>The Hangzhou na­tive, who de­clined to be named, said he bought the pro­tec­tive out­fit es­pe­cially for the flight. “It’s a bit trou­ble­some and quite hot in this iso­la­tion suit, but there’s no choice, I have to pro­tect my­self,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Trans­port Min­istry and Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day, said pas­sen­gers de­part­ing for China on or af­ter next Tues­day should ap­proach the rel­e­vant agen­cies to ar­range a pre-de­par­ture Covid-19 test within five days of their flights.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties had made spe­cial ar­range­ments for pas­sen­gers on China-bound flights de­part­ing from yes­ter­day to Mon­day to be tested at a re­gional screen­ing cen­tre at the for­mer Shuqun Sec­ondary School in Jurong East.</p>
