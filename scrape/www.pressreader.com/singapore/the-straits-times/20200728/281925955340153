    <p>BANGKOK • More than one mil­lion peo­ple in Ph­nom Penh face the risk of in­creased flood­ing and loss of liveli­hoods as wet­lands in the Cam­bo­dian cap­i­tal are de­stroyed to build apart­ments and in­dus­tries, hu­man rights groups warned yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ments – in­clud­ing the ING City town­ship – will re­duce the Tom­poun wet­lands to less than a tenth of its 1,500ha and lead to the evic­tion of more than 1,000 fam­i­lies who live on its edge, ac­tivists said in a re­port.</p>
    <p>It would also im­pov­er­ish thou­sands of fam­i­lies who farm and fish in the wet­lands in the city of 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The wet­lands sus­tain lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties and play a vi­tal role in Ph­nom Penh’s waste man­age­ment and flood preven­tion,” said the re­port from Eq­ui­table Cam­bo­dia, non-profit hu­man rights group Li­cadho, the Cam­bo­dian Youth Net­work and land rights group Sah­makum Teang Tnaut (STT).</p>
    <p>“Mil­lions of Cam­bo­di­ans will likely be af­fected by the po­ten­tially dev­as­tat­ing im­pacts of de­stroy­ing the wet­lands.”</p>
    <p>Ph­nom Penh, sit­u­ated on the banks of the Tonle Sap, Mekong and Bas­sac rivers, is highly vul­ner­a­ble to floods, par­tic­u­larly in the rainy sea­son from June to Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Lakes and wet­lands, such as flood­plains, man­groves and marshes, reg­u­late wa­ter flow, min­imise flood­ing, pu­rify wa­ter and re­plen­ish ground­wa­ter, said se­nior re­search fel­low Diane Archer at the Stock­holm En­vi­ron­ment In­sti­tute in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>“City au­thor­i­ties should recog­nise wet­lands as an im­por­tant re­source to be pro­tected and in­te­grated into the ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment,” she told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion. “Yet in many cities, ex­pan­sion takes place with­out the nec­es­sary en­force­ment of ur­ban plan­ning or in-depth en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact as­sess­ments.”</p>
    <p>Although Cam­bo­dia has en­dorsed the in­ter­na­tional con­ven­tion on wet­lands pro­tec­tion, about half its wet­lands have dis­ap­peared over the past 15 years, ac­cord­ing to con­ser­va­tion group Wild­fowl and Wet­lands Trust.</p>
    <p>In Ph­nom Penh, 15 of 25 lakes have been in­filled, with about a third of the Tom­poun wet­land in­filled so far, STT said.</p>
    <p>Eq­ui­table Cam­bo­dia’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Eang Vuthy said dredg­ing the more than 100 mil­lion tonnes of sand needed for in­fill­ing poses added risks to com­mu­ni­ties and the en­vi­ron­ment. “Given that mil­lions will be af­fected, in-depth stud­ies and pub­lic con­sul­ta­tions are needed,” he added.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment spokesman Phay Siphan said the recla­ma­tion was nec­es­sary for the city’s de­vel­op­ment, and that an en­vi­ron­ment im­pact as­sess­ment had been done.</p>
    <p>“A canal is be­ing built to di­vert ex­cess wa­ter, and there is a waste­water treat­ment plant. Some re­lo­ca­tions are nec­es­sary, but they have been given am­ple time to move.”</p>
