    <p>IN­STA­GRAM POST PURGE: Li Yan (right), daugh­ter of for­mer Chi­nese ac­tor Li Yapeng (far right), 49, and pop diva Faye Wong, 51, has gone quiet on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The 14-year-old is known to be ac­tive on so­cial me­dia, but was re­cently found to have deleted all her posts on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Li Yan had re­ceived a lot of crit­i­cism in the past for flaunt­ing her wealth on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Last year, she set tongues wag­ging af­ter she en­rolled in a pri­vate board­ing school in Switzer­land, which re­port­edly cost more than US$100,000 (S$134,000) a year for tu­ition and board­ing.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens were quick to scru­ti­nise her fash­ion choices, with her bag, clothes and sneak­ers found to be branded items.</p>
    <p>Li Yan used soft­ware to erase the brand name of a hand­bag she car­ried in one photo posted on so­cial me­dia, as she ad­mit­ted to fans that it was “dif­fi­cult” for her.</p>
    <p>Her In­sta­gram is now de­void of any posts, as she wrote in the bio sec­tion: “Please put aside your prej­u­dice be­fore com­ing in.”</p>
    <p>Li Yan, who was born with a cleft palate, has been in the pub­lic eye since she was a baby.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents, who are di­vorced, took Li Yan to the United States for surgery af­ter she was born in 2006.</p>
    <p>Li Yapeng and Wong later set up the Smile An­gel Foun­da­tion, a char­ity for Chi­nese chil­dren with cleft palates.</p>
