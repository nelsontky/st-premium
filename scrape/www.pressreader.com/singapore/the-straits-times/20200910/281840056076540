    <p>We wiped out about 20 vil­lages.</p>
    <p>PTE ZAW NAING TUN, who added that he dumped bod­ies in a mass grave.</p>
    <p>NAYPY­ITAW • The two sol­diers con­fess their crimes in a mono­tone, a few blinks of the eye their only be­trayal of emo­tion: ex­e­cu­tions, mass buri­als, vil­lage oblit­er­a­tions and rape.</p>
    <p>The Au­gust 2017 or­der from his com­mand­ing of­fi­cer was clear, Pri­vate Myo Win Tun said in video tes­ti­mony. “Shoot all you see and all you hear.”</p>
    <p>He said he obeyed, tak­ing part in the mas­sacre of 30 Ro­hingya Mus­lims and bury­ing them in a mass grave near a cell tower and a mil­i­tary base.</p>
    <p>Around the same time, in a neigh­bour­ing town­ship, Pte Zaw Naing Tun said he and his com­rades in an­other bat­tal­ion fol­lowed a nearly iden­ti­cal di­rec­tive from his su­pe­rior: “Kill all you see, whether chil­dren or adults.”</p>
    <p>Pte Zaw Naing Tun said: “We wiped out about 20 vil­lages.” He added that he, too, dumped bod­ies in a mass grave.</p>
    <p>The two sol­diers’ video tes­ti­mony, recorded by a rebel mili­tia, is the first time that mem­bers of the Tat­madaw, as Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary is known, have openly con­fessed to tak­ing part in what United Na­tions of­fi­cials say was a geno­ci­dal cam­paign against the coun­try’s Ro­hingya Mus­lim mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the two men, who fled Myan­mar last month, were trans­ported to The Hague, where the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court (ICC) has opened a case ex­am­in­ing</p>
    <p>Pte Myo Win Tun (left) and Pte Zaw Naing Tun are the first mem­bers of Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary to openly con­fess to tak­ing part in what United Na­tions of­fi­cials say was a geno­ci­dal cam­paign against the Ro­hingya. whether Tat­madaw lead­ers com­mit­ted large-scale crimes against the Ro­hingya.</p>
    <p>The atroc­i­ties de­scribed by the two men echo ev­i­dence of se­ri­ous hu­man rights abuses gath­ered from among the more than one mil­lion Ro­hingya refugees now shel­ter­ing in neigh­bour­ing Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>What dis­tin­guishes their tes­ti­mony is that it comes from per­pe­tra­tors, not vic­tims.</p>
    <p>“This is a mon­u­men­tal mo­ment for Ro­hingya and the peo­ple of Myan­mar in their on­go­ing strug­gle for jus­tice,” said Mr Matthew</p>
    <p>Smith, chief ex­ec­u­tive at For­tify Rights, a hu­man rights watch­dog. “These men could be the first per­pe­tra­tors from Myan­mar tried at the ICC, and the first in­sider wit­nesses in the cus­tody of the court.”</p>
    <p>The New York Times can­not in­de­pen­dently con­firm that the two sol­diers com­mit­ted the crimes to which they con­fessed. But de­tails in their nar­ra­tives con­form to de­scrip­tions pro­vided by dozens of wit­nesses and ob­servers, in­clud­ing Ro­hingya refugees, Rakhine res­i­dents, Tat­madaw sol­diers and lo­cal politi­cians.</p>
    <p>And mul­ti­ple vil­lagers in­de­pen­dently con­firmed the where­abouts of mass graves that the sol­diers pro­vided in their tes­ti­mony – ev­i­dence that will be seized on in in­ves­ti­ga­tions at the ICC and other le­gal pro­ceed­ings. The Myan­mar gov­ern­ment has re­peat­edly de­nied that such sites ex­ist across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The crimes that the sol­diers say were car­ried out by their in­fantry bat­tal­ions and other se­cu­rity forces – some 150 civil­ians killed and dozens of vil­lages de­stroyed – are just a part of Myan­mar’s long cam­paign against the Ro­hingya. And they por­tray a con­certed, cal­cu­lated op­er­a­tion to ex­ter­mi­nate a sin­gle eth­nic mi­nor­ity group, the is­sue at the heart of on­go­ing geno­cide cases.</p>
    <p>The mas­sacres of Ro­hingya that cul­mi­nated in 2017 catal­ysed one of the fastest flights of refugees any­where in the world. Within weeks, three-quar­ters of a mil­lion state­less peo­ple were up­rooted from their homes in Myan­mar’s west­ern Rakhine state, as se­cu­rity forces at­tacked their vil­lages with ri­fles, ma­chetes and flamethrow­ers. Old men were de­cap­i­tated, and young girls were raped, their head­scarves torn off to use as blind­folds, wit­nesses and sur­vivors said.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors With­out Bor­ders es­ti­mated that at least 6,700 Ro­hingya, in­clud­ing 730 chil­dren, suf­fered vi­o­lent deaths from late Au­gust to late Septem­ber 2017. Roughly 200 Ro­hingya set­tle­ments were com­pletely razed from 2017 to last year, the UN said.</p>
    <p>In a re­port pub­lished last year, a fact-find­ing mis­sion for the UN Hu­man Rights Coun­cil said “there is a se­ri­ous risk that geno­ci­dal ac­tions may oc­cur or re­cur and that Myan­mar is fail­ing in its obli­ga­tion to pre­vent geno­cide, to in­ves­ti­gate geno­cide and to en­act ef­fec­tive leg­is­la­tion crim­i­nal­is­ing and pun­ish­ing geno­cide”.</p>
    <p>The Myan­mar gov­ern­ment has de­nied any or­ches­trated cam­paign against the Ro­hingya. In De­cem­ber, Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the na­tion’s civil­ian leader, de­fended Myan­mar against charges of geno­cide in an­other case, this one at the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice in The Hague.</p>
    <p>Only a few Tat­madaw sol­diers have been pun­ished, with brief prison terms, for what the mil­i­tary says were iso­lated mis­steps in a cou­ple of vil­lages.</p>
