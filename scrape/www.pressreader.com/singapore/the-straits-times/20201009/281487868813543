    <p>De­mand for Hous­ing Board re­sale flats has re­mained healthy de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, with prices ris­ing for the third straight month.</p>
    <p>HDB re­sale prices rose by 0.8 per cent last month com­pared with Au­gust – a faster rate than the pre­vi­ous two months, ac­cord­ing to flash es­ti­mates from real es­tate por­tal SRX yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More than 2,400 units were sold last month for the fourth straight month, well above the two-year monthly av­er­age of 1,842 units sold be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break, noted Orange Tee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of re­search and con­tent at Prop Nex, said: “Feed­back from our real es­tate agents sug­gests that there is stiff com­pe­ti­tion for HDB re­sale units in the mar­ket, so pric­ing should con­tinue to find sup­port in the months ahead.”</p>
    <p>The high­est trans­acted price for a re­sale flat recorded last month was $1.258 mil­lion for a five­room flat at The Pin­na­cle@Dux­ton in Tan­jong Pa­gar. It is one of eight HDB re­sale flats that sold for at least $1 mil­lion that month.</p>
    <p>Prices of Hous­ing Board (HDB) re­sale flats in­creased for the third con­sec­u­tive month last month, with de­mand re­main­ing el­e­vated af­ter the nearly two-month-long cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>HDB re­sale prices rose by 0.8 per cent last month com­pared with Au­gust, a faster rate than the pre­vi­ous two months, and were 3.1 per cent higher year on year. How­ever, they were still 11.4 per cent lower than their peak in April 2013.</p>
    <p>In all, 2,489 HDB re­sale flats changed hands last month, a 2.2 per cent in­crease from Au­gust, flash es­ti­mates from real es­tate por­tal SRX showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Year on year, re­sale vol­ume last month was 32.7 per cent higher than the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>More than 2,400 units were sold last month for the fourth straight month, well above the two-year monthly av­er­age (be­tween Jan­uary 2018 and De­cem­ber last year) of 1,842 units sold be­fore the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>The HDB re­sale mar­ket has chalked up the strong­est quar­terly sales since the third quar­ter of 2016, with 7,394 units sold from July to last month, said Orange­Tee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun.</p>
    <p>“This in­di­cates that over­all de­mand in the HDB re­sale mar­ket is gen­er­ally healthy this year de­spite the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, eco­nomic</p>
    <p>slow­down and Covid-19,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun added that the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val failed to put a dent in hous­ing de­mand this year as it had in pre­vi­ous years.</p>
    <p>The de­mand may have been boosted by young cou­ples who turned to HDB re­sale flats af­ter be­com­ing aware of the longer com­ple­tion pe­riod of newly launched BuildTo-Or­der projects, with a four to five year wait in some cases, she said.</p>
    <p>“Some buy­ers are HDB up­graders</p>
    <p>who are turn­ing to the HDB re­sale mar­ket due to price af­ford­abil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Prices have also in­creased across the board for all HDB re­sale flat types com­pared with a year ago.</p>
    <p>Four-room flats saw the big­gest price in­crease, with 2.7 per cent, fol­lowed by three-room and ex­ec­u­tive flats, up 2.5 per cent, and five-room flats, which rose 2.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Last month, the high­est trans­acted price for a re­sale flat was $1.258 mil­lion for a five-room unit at</p>
    <p>The Pin­na­cle@Dux­ton in Tan­jong Pa­gar. It was one of eight HDB re­sale flats that sold for at least $1 mil­lion that month.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun noted that this ap­pears to be a “his­tor­i­cal high”, as the high­est trans­acted price be­fore this was</p>
    <p>$1.232 mil­lion for a five-room HDB flat in the same de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak said the rise in HDB re­sale prices was un­der­pinned by the pro­por­tion­ally higher num­ber of newer HDB flats – those with re­main­ing leases of 90 years or more – trans­acted.</p>
    <p>“These newer flats would usu­ally com­mand higher prices than the older flats in the vicin­ity, which would con­trib­ute to the in­crease in the price in­dex,” said Mr Mak.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of re­search and con­tent at PropNex, said: “Feed­back from our real es­tate agents sug­gests that there is stiff com­pe­ti­tion for HDB re­sale units in the mar­ket, so pric­ing should con­tinue to find sup­port in the months ahead. We be­lieve the HDB re­sale mar­ket has turned a cor­ner and re­mains up­beat about its out­look this year, in spite of the pan­demic-led eco­nomic down­turn.”</p>
