    <p>SHERLOCK SAM AND THE SEAFARING SCOURGE ON SEN­TOSA</p>
    <p>By A.J. Low, il­lus­trated by Drews­cape</p>
    <p>Epi­gram Books/Pa­per­back/144 pages/$13.80/ Avail­able at bit.ly/Sher­lock­SamSen­tosa_Low</p>
    <p>In the 15th in­stal­ment of this best-sell­ing mys­tery se­ries, kid de­tec­tive Sa­muel Tan Cher Lock, his trusty ro­bot Wat­son and his friends, called The Sup­per Club, sail around Sin­ga­pore’s lesser-known is­lands to re­cover price­less stolen arte­facts.</p>
    <p>Hus­band-and-wife duo Adan Jimenez, 37, and Feli­cia Low-Jimenez, 42, men­tion cas­sette tapes, Walk­mans, modems and land­lines in the book, be­cause of all the blank looks they get from kids when they talk about “cool retro tech­nol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>They would like to feel less an­cient, they say.</p>
    <p>Q: How are Sherlock Sam, Wat­son and The Sup­per Club spend­ing their school hol­i­days?</p>
    <p>They will be on an­other case or two be­cause school hol­i­days are prime mys­tery-solv­ing time (bad guys are con­sid­er­ate that way).</p>
    <p>Other than that, they’ll be read­ing lots of books and comics, eat­ing lots of de­li­cious food and post­ing about it on In­stanoodle­gram (a so­cial me­dia plat­form we in­vented for the books).</p>
    <p>I, HUCKLEBERR­Y</p>
    <p>By Si­mon Ch­ester­man</p>
    <p>Mar­shall Cavendish/Pa­per­back/248 pages/$19.99/ Avail­able at bit.ly/IHuck­le­ber­ry_SM</p>
    <p>New York teen Huckleberr­y Jones is sent away by his par­ents to camp at Ox­ford Univer­sity, where he and his new friends – Kat from England, Tshombe from Zam­bia and Mei from Sin­ga­pore – get em­broiled in a mys­tery sur­round­ing the Magna Carta, the most fa­mous le­gal text in his­tory.</p>
    <p>Ch­ester­man, 48, law dean at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, has am­bi­tious hol­i­day plans for his own chil­dren, aged 16, 13 and four. “There are bike paths we’ve not yet trav­elled and we’re teach­ing the kids es­sen­tial life skills like cook­ing, wood­work and hand-to-hand com­bat.”</p>
    <p>Q: How is Huck spend­ing his school hol­i­days?</p>
    <p>Huck’s story ac­tu­ally takes place dur­ing the school hol­i­days. He meets Kat, Mei and Tshombe when they are all sent to camp for ex­cep­tional teenagers at Ox­ford Univer­sity in the weeks be­fore Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Pretty quickly, how­ever, he starts to sus­pect that all is not what it seems. Then he gets caught up in the search for a me­di­ae­val man­u­script and the true ad­ven­ture be­gins.</p>
    <p>By N.J. Humphreys</p>
    <p>Mar­shall Cavendish/ Pa­per­back/ 208 pages/ $16/ Avail­able at goguru.sg</p>
    <p>Princess Sab­rina Va­lence is liv­ing un­der­cover in a dreary hous­ing es­tate, but when she stops a nasty rob­ber out­side the ice cream par­lour, her ac­ci­den­tal fame could blow her cover.</p>
    <p>The book is about deal­ing with “that an­noy­ing bully in our school or in our neigh­bour­hood”, says Sin­ga­pore-based Bri­tish satirist Neil Humphreys, 45.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ter Ab­bie Rose, 12, gave him the idea for Sab­rina. “I’m more of a vam­pire than a father and it’s be­com­ing a se­ri­ous prob­lem,” he quips.</p>
    <p>“My daugh­ter un­der­stands roy­al­ties now. She wants some. I say I’m pay­ing her in kind­ness. She says she can’t use that cur­rency at Bath & Body Works.”</p>
    <p>Q: How is Sab­rina spend­ing her school hol­i­days?</p>
    <p>In hid­ing! She’s a princess incognito, es­cap­ing a civil war in her own coun­try and liv­ing in the world’s worst hous­ing es­tate.</p>
    <p>Plus, she’s got all th­ese ter­rific skills she can’t use and lives with an “un­cle”/body­guard who farts and snores too much. So she’ll prob­a­bly try and sneak out­side for ad­ven­tures with her friends.</p>
    <p>AMAZ­ING ASH & SUPERHERO AH MA</p>
    <p>By Me­lanie Lee and Arif Rafhan Dif­fer­ence En­gine/Pa­per­back/ 248 pages/$18 be­fore GST/ Avail­able at clos­et­fulof­books.com</p>
    <p>In this comic, Ash, 11, is strug­gling with maths, neigh­bour­hood bul­lies and hav­ing her phone con­fis­cated by her mother.</p>
    <p>When she dis­cov­ers her grand­mother has su­per­pow­ers, which she too will in­herit, she is de­lighted. But Ah Ma is also deal­ing with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Writer Lee, 41, lives in Sin­ga­pore while il­lus­tra­tor Arif, 43, is based in Malaysia, so the comic had to be put to­gether dur­ing Covid-19 bor­der clo­sures largely over Google Drive and Zoom.</p>
    <p>Q: How is Ash spend­ing her school hol­i­days?</p>
    <p>Sav­ing peo­ple (but only af­ter the home­work is done)!</p>
