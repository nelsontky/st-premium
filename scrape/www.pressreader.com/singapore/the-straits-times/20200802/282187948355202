    <p>For the past 19 years, Ms Sherry Soon has lived with what she calls an “in­vis­i­ble con­di­tion”.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old has vas­culi­tis, an auto-im­mune con­di­tion that causes in­flam­ma­tion of her blood ves­sels and deep, pus-filled ul­cers to erupt on her feet when­ever it flares up.</p>
    <p>She has been hos­pi­talised re­peat­edly and is on a long-term course of low-grade chemo­ther­apy med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2016, she left her job as a learn­ing spe­cial­ist for chil­dren with spe­cial needs be­cause long hours of stand­ing or walk­ing of­ten trig­gered her symp­toms. The dis­ease has no cure.</p>
    <p>But liv­ing with vas­culi­tis and work­ing in the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor made Ms Soon more sen­si­tive to the dif­fi­cul­ties that many in so­ci­ety face.</p>
    <p>“Al­most ev­ery­one has a strug­gle that we can’t see,” she says.</p>
    <p>Be Kind SG, a ground-up vol­un­teer group she founded in 2017, aims to rem­edy these strug­gles and bring them into the light.</p>
    <p>Among its reg­u­lar ben­e­fi­cia­ries are homes for adults with in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­i­ties, where vol­un­teers used to con­duct work­shops and or­gan­ise events prior to the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They have re­cently switched to Zoom ses­sions, in which they play games and sing songs to keep res­i­dents en­ter­tained.</p>
    <p>“We want to help peo­ple con­nect with dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore and bet­ter un­der­stand one another,” says Ms Soon, who runs Be Kind SG full time.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, Mr Chen Yingkai, 38, works in a fin­tech com­pany.</p>
    <p>Be Kind SG pro­motes mi­cro­vol­un­teer­ing, so even busy work­ing adults can drop in on ac­tiv­i­ties that are run al­most ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>This year, vol­un­teers took part in more than 10 coron­avirus-re­lated projects.</p>
    <p>In one such ini­tia­tive, the group col­lab­o­rated with the Viva Foun­da­tion for Chil­dren with Can­cer to pre­pare 100 ac­tiv­ity kits for chil­dren in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The kits com­prised one of two books from lo­cal au­thors. For in­stance, Murphy, See How You Shine! by Chen Wei Teng, about a blind spe­cial as­sis­tance dog, is meant to help read­ers re­alise they can all con­trib­ute in their own way.</p>
    <p>The books were pack­aged to­gether with ac­tiv­i­ties such as crossword puz­zles, colour­ing sheets and colour pen­cils.</p>
    <p>“With Covid-19 re­stric­tions, vol­un­teers had to stop vis­it­ing the chil­dren, so we came up with new ways to keep them en­gaged,” she says.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with the South Cen­tral Com­mu­nity Fam­ily Ser­vice Centre, she also took part in Project Masak Masak, cre­at­ing 220 craft and ac­tiv­ity kits for chil­dren from low­in­come fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The kits, which com­prise sim­ple and nostalgic games such as pick-up sticks as well as snakes and lad­ders, and card games Snap and Old Maid, were de­signed to give par­ents a chance to bond with their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She adds: “Be­cause of Covid-19 and the cir­cuit breaker, many peo­ple felt alone.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant for them to feel the hu­man con­nec­tion and that’s why we tried to do projects to bring peo­ple to­gether.”</p>
