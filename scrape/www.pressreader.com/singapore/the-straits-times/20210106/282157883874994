    <p>Sup­port for the vul­ner­a­ble, both young and old, was a key fo­cus on the sec­ond day of Par­lia­ment de­bates this new year.</p>
    <p>This is timely as both groups count among those dis­pro­por­tion­ately hit by the fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But they also re­flect the longer-term trends that Sin­ga­pore and the world must grap­ple with – from shrink­ing family sizes and ris­ing di­vorce rates, to an ageing work­force and its im­pact on ev­ery­thing from hous­ing to health­care.</p>
    <p>On di­vorce, a Min­istry of So­cial and Family Devel­op­ment study re­leased last month has been the sub­ject of some con­tro­versy. It showed that chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents tend to earn less and are more likely to get di­vorced than their peers whose par­ents stayed to­gether.</p>
    <p>This drew a re­sponse from non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search last month. In a Face­book post on Dec 11, it ex­pressed con­cerns that the study’s method­ol­ogy “masks im­por­tant sub­tleties in strength of family ties, in­come and others that may con­trib­ute to these out­comes”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, MP Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) also ques­tioned the min­istry’s in­ten­tion and mo­ti­va­tion be­hind the study, point­ing out that it may not be help­ful to couples who are al­ready hav­ing a hard time.</p>
    <p>She added that it could lead to fur­ther un­in­tended stig­ma­ti­sa­tion of di­vorce, and asked if such com­mu­ni­ca­tions could be bet­ter planned in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Family Devel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing stressed that the in­tent of the study was “not to guilt-trip any­one”, nor was it to im­ply di­rect causal­ity be­tween di­vorce and out­comes in life.</p>
    <p>Rather, she ex­plained, the hope was to share data with prac­ti­tion­ers and fam­i­lies, un­der­stand the po­ten­tial im­pact of di­vorce, and – where mi­nors are in­volved – find the best way to mit­i­gate the im­pact on them.</p>
    <p>But it is not just adults who ought to be sup­ported; so too, must their chil­dren who are af­fected.</p>
    <p>For this, par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Chil­dren in Be­tween pro­gramme – which helps chil­dren aged six to 15 man­age their feel­ings and de­velop re­silience – has been patchy to say the least.</p>
    <p>Although there are about 6,500 chil­dren a year whose par­ents get di­vorced, only about 100 chil­dren at­tend the pro­gramme – a statis­tic which prompted MP Louis Ng</p>
    <p>(Nee Soon GRC) to sug­gest mak­ing it com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>This is not un­like the ex­ist­ing Manda­tory Par­ent­ing Pro­gramme (MPP), so Ms Sun said the min­istry would study this.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, all par­ents with chil­dren be­low the age of 21 must at­tend the MPP, which en­cour­ages them to pri­ori­tise their chil­dren’s well-be­ing even as they un­dergo the wrench­ing process of di­vorce.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing to the needs of ma­ture work­ers, MP Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC) asked what is be­ing done to help them tran­si­tion be­tween in­dus­tries, es­pe­cially where their ed­u­ca­tional</p>
    <p>qual­i­fi­ca­tions may not be as high as younger em­ploy­ees’.</p>
    <p>Re­lat­edly, MP Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) asked if the Man­power Min­istry would con­sider rais­ing the sup­port thresh­old for the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI) from 50 per cent to 75 per cent to in­cen­tivise the hir­ing of older work­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme which started in Septem­ber last year, the Gov­ern­ment un­der­writes half of the salaries of ma­ture job seek­ers aged 40 and above, up to the first $5,000, for 12 months. This is dou­ble the wage sup­port for younger new lo­cal hires.</p>
    <p>Mr Giam pressed for more data on the JGI, in­clud­ing whether the au­thor­i­ties have set a tar­get num­ber for ma­ture work­ers hired un­der the scheme. He ex­plained that with­out such a tar­get, it would be hard for the au­thor­i­ties to as­cer­tain if there is a need to read­just the sup­port thresh­old.</p>
    <p>But the prob­lem with be­ing fix­ated on a num­ber, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, is that un­less over­all eco­nomic con­di­tions are good and busi­ness con­fi­dence is high, it will not pro­duce the in­tended re­sult “no mat­ter how lofty the tar­gets”.</p>
    <p>It also has to work in con­cert with other schemes, she added.</p>
    <p>“When we ex­am­ine the range of schemes and tools that we have at our dis­posal, it has to be in terms of how they com­ple­ment one an­other.</p>
    <p>“The JGI tries to en­cour­age the em­ploy­ers to ex­pand hir­ing, but we know that for the po­si­tions that re­quire higher skills de­mands from job seek­ers, JGI alone will not do the trick.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, an em­ployer that meets the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria for the JGI and hires a ma­ture lo­cal worker via a pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme will re­ceive not only the 50 per cent JGI, but also ad­di­tional salary sup­port and course fee sub­si­dies, as well as fur­ther salary sup­port un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme of wage sub­si­dies, if el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>At the heart of Mrs Teo’s re­sponse was this: It is not enough to im­prove the in­cen­tives for older peo­ple to con­tinue work­ing. They must also have bet­ter op­por­tu­ni­ties to do so.</p>
    <p>Thus, a key is­sue for more in­clu­sive ageing and em­ploy­ment poli­cies is to en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to hire and re­tain older work­ers in bet­ter jobs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not alone in at­tempt­ing to use time-lim­ited fund­ing and other sup­port schemes to get or­gan­i­sa­tions to em­ploy older work­ers, with all their at­ten­dant chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>JGI or oth­er­wise, there is al­ways the temp­ta­tion on the part of em­ploy­ers to dis­place ex­ist­ing work­ers, or to sim­ply ro­tate el­i­gi­ble ones through such pro­grammes with­out longer-term plans or prospects for them.</p>
    <p>But these chal­lenges should not de­ter the Gov­ern­ment from mak­ing stren­u­ous ef­forts to make more pro­duc­tive use of ma­ture work­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s work­force may be vis­i­bly grey­ing, but ac­cord­ing to a 2018 Econ­o­mist In­tel­li­gence Unit sur­vey of res­i­dents aged 55 to 64, no more than 5 per cent of them have the de­sire to re­tire soon.</p>
    <p>Older Sin­ga­pore­ans may be up for the chal­lenge, but it is also in­cum­bent on em­ploy­ers to do more than pay lip ser­vice in hir­ing them.</p>
    <p>If gov­ern­ment poli­cies aimed at ex­tend­ing ca­reers are suc­cess­ful, the re­ward will be greater con­tri­bu­tion from older gen­er­a­tions of work­ers to sus­tain­able eco­nomic growth for this coun­try.</p>
