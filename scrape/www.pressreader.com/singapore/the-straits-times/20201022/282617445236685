    <p>TOKYO • In the United States and Europe, movies are be­ing shown to seas of empty seats, if the­atres are open­ing at all.</p>
    <p>But in Ja­pan, an an­i­mated film just had the big­gest box-of­fice week­end in the coun­try’s his­tory – by far.</p>
    <p>The movie, De­mon Slayer: Mu­gen Train, based on a smash-hit Ja­panese manga, had been hotly an­tic­i­pated for months by fans and an i ndus­try des­per­ate to get movie­go­ers back in front of big screens amid the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The film out­per­formed all ex­pec­ta­tions, more than dou­bling the coun­try’s record for the largest open­ing week­end, with more than 3.4 million peo­ple shelling out 4.62 bil­lion yen (S$59.5 million) on tick­ets.</p>
    <p>It is a direct se­quel to the an­ime se­ries De­mon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, which is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>In what may be a first for Ja­pan, the movie had the big­gest open­ing in the world last week­end – more than all other coun­tries com­bined – de­spite hav­ing de­buted only do­mes­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>There is not much com­pe­ti­tion right now, as one Hol­ly­wood stu­dio af­ter another has pushed back big-bud­get re­leases.</p>
    <p>The mag­ni­tude of the film’s suc­cess would have been an out­lier even un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, but it has spe­cial sig­nif­i­cance dur­ing the pan­demic, show­ing how rapidly au­di­ences may re­turn once they feel safe spend­ing hours sit­ting among strangers in crowded spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has kept coron­avirus cases and deaths low, with a rel­a­tively light touch that re­lies on con­tact trac­ing and ap­peals to a na­tional sense of so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>While in­fec­tions are soar­ing again in much of the West, the daily num­ber of new cases in Ja­pan has stayed be­low 800 since the end of Au­gust. In Tokyo, daily life, at least on the sur­face, has mostly re­turned to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>For many who saw De­mon Slayer over the week­end, it was their first time re­turn­ing to the cin­e­mas since April, when the gov­ern­ment de­clared a brief na­tional emer­gency over con­cerns about ris­ing cases of the virus.</p>
    <p>The story, set in early 20th-cen­tury Ja­pan, fol­lows a young man who joins a group of war­riors com­mit­ted to wip­ing out de­mons that killed his fam­ily and cursed his sis­ter.</p>
    <p>The manga on which the movie is based is part of a 22-vol­ume se­ries that has be­come a na­tional phe­nom­e­non. In the four years since its launch, it has sold more than 100 million copies, mak­ing it one of the most suc­cess­ful manga of all time.</p>
    <p>The comics have been turned into a pop­u­lar an­ime se­ries that has found fans world­wide, and De­mon Slayer char­ac­ters dec­o­rate ev­ery­thing from rice balls to train liv­ery in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“This par­tic­u­lar ti­tle cuts across gen­er­a­tions. Even peo­ple over 40, over 50, re­ally like De­mon Slayer,” said Mr Roland Kelts, a vis­it­ing pro­fes­sor of me­dia stud­ies at Waseda Uni­ver­sity in Tokyo and the au­thor of the book Ja­panamer­ica.</p>
    <p>The se­ries is “quite sen­ti­men­tal, but it’s well done,” he said, adding that it had “been very clever about build­ing an au­di­ence and sus­tain­ing it” through on­line stream­ing ser­vices.</p>
