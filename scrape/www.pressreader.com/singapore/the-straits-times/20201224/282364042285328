    <p>SPE­CIAL EL­E­MENT</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Paul Lim’s hopes of de­liv­er­ing an­other giant-slay­ing feat in the sec­ond round of the PDC World Darts Cham­pi­onship were dashed yes­ter­day when the vet­eran was beaten 3-0 (3-0, 3-1, 3-1) by Bel­gium’s world No. 9 Dim­itri van den Bergh.</p>
    <p>The 66-year-old had pro­duced a first-round shock when he fought back from 2-0 down to beat world</p>
    <p>No. 34 English­man Luke Humphries 3-2 on Fri­day, but a re­peat come­back win against an­other for­mer world youth cham­pion proved a bridge too far.</p>
    <p>While he im­proved on his check­out per­cent­age like he wanted to – from 30 per cent in the first round to 100 per cent – the un­ranked Sin­ga­porean had just two looks at the out­shot dou­ble, and could not keep up with his op­po­nent’s red­hot scor­ing.</p>
    <p>Van den Bergh, the 26-year-old reign­ing World Match­play cham­pion, av­er­aged over 105 against Lim’s 89, and barely gave the old­est player at the Pro­fes­sional Darts Cor­po­ra­tion (PDC) tour­na­ment a sniff at an­other up­set.</p>
    <p>Lim told The Straits Times: “Con­grat­u­la­tions to Dim­itri. He was solid and I felt like I was run­ning into a rock.”</p>
    <p>Van den Bergh paid trib­ute to Lim, say­ing: “I knew I couldn’t give Paul a chance and I didn’t. I think I showed what I am ca­pa­ble of and I’m happy I was able to be at the top of my game. I feel like I am com­ing here as one of the best play­ers in the world af­ter win­ning in the World Match­play and I think my per­for­mance proved that I am.”</p>
    <p>Lim pock­eted £15,000 (S$26,863) for his ef­forts and is cur­rently await­ing the lift­ing of the coro­n­avirus-en­forced travel ban from Lon­don to Hong Kong, where he lives and works as a con­sul­tant,</p>
    <p>Van den Bergh will face ei­ther Dutch­man Jer­maine Wat­ti­mena or Wales’ Nick Kenny in the third round.</p>
    <p>Up to 1,000 fans were al­lowed into the Alexan­dra Palace venue on the open­ing night on Dec 15, but the doors were closed the fol­low­ing day with Lon­don go­ing into Tier 3 restrictio­ns. Since last Sun­day, it is in the strictest Tier 4.</p>
    <p>While Lim missed the at­mos­phere, he said: “It can boost or de­stroy one’s game, de­pend­ing on the player’s men­tal strength and con­di­tion. But the bois­ter­ous crowd and their fancy dresses are part of the tra­di­tion, and I hope things will clear up and we can all be back next year.”</p>
    <p>The bois­ter­ous crowd and their fancy dresses are part of the tra­di­tion, and I hope things will clear up and we can all be back next year.</p>
