    <p>OR­LANDO • The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals fea­tur­ing the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers and the Mi­ami Heat is a clash be­tween old friends and foes.</p>
    <p>Lak­ers for­ward LeBron James will be up against his for­mer team, with whom he won the first two of his three NBA ti­tles dur­ing his stint from 2010 to 2014.</p>
    <p>Pat Ri­ley, the for­mer Lak­ers player and coach, is the Heat’s pres­i­dent who has been re­build­ing the team, par­tic­u­larly since James’ exit.</p>
    <p>Lak­ers guard Dion Wait­ers, who played for Mi­ami be­fore his move to Los An­ge­les in March, could be in line for a ring no mat­ter who wins.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are the names who are linked to both sides but Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra, who helped build James into a win­ner, could also be con­sid­ered as one who knows his for­mer star in­side out.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia on Tues­day, he was asked how James is dif­fer­ent now as to when he last ap­peared in a Heat jer­sey in 2014.</p>
    <p>He said: “He’s seen ev­ery­thing. At this point in his ca­reer, it’s just about win­ning. And his abil­ity to do what he does at his age is in­cred­i­bly un­com­mon. But there’s a lot of work that goes on be­hind the scenes.”</p>
    <p>By reach­ing the cham­pi­onship round, the 35-year-old James joins Bill Rus­sell (12), Sam Jones (11) and Ka­reem Ab­dul-Jab­bar (10) as the only play­ers with 10 or more NBA Fi­nals ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>Not only is he back in the ti­tle de­cider, he is also do­ing it while still play­ing at an elite level, hav­ing re­cently fin­ished runner-up for the Most Valu­able Player hon­ours.</p>
    <p>“To see what LeBron has done, when he moved on to Cleve­land and then to (Los An­ge­les), it re­ally is just a tes­ta­ment to his great­ness and his com­mit­ment to win­ning,” added Spoel­stra. “To be able to do it with dif­fer­ent ros­ters and uni­forms is re­ally re­mark­able.”</p>
    <p>On the eve of the Fi­nals, James re­flected on the four sea­sons he spent with the Heat, a team he joined when he was 25.</p>
    <p>“I was still a kid and still try­ing to fig­ure out who I am as a per­son and as a man,” he said. “I grew, and they al­lowed me to grow.”</p>
    <p>The Heat are a team who are the work of for­mer Laker Ri­ley, who knows all about win­ning as a coach.</p>
    <p>He won four ti­tles in the 80s hey­day of Magic John­son and Ab­dulJab­bar, an­other with the Dwyane Wade and Shaquille O’Neal-led Heat in 2006, and then ac­quired the team of James, Wade and Chris Bosh for their 2012 and 2013 tri­umphs.</p>
    <p>“Prob­a­bly one of the great­est minds this game has ever had... This league is not the same with­out Riles,” said James. “He’s a great guy, great mo­ti­va­tor, some­one who just knows what it takes to win.”</p>
    <p>He added of Spoel­stra: “The play­ers know how great Spo is. He pre­pares his team ev­ery sin­gle night. They are go­ing to play hard, they are go­ing to play to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Wait­ers is wait­ing to get his first NBA ring. Be­fore join­ing the Lak­ers as a free agent, the 28-year-old played just three games for Mi­ami av­er­ag­ing 9.3 points, 3.7 re­bounds and 1 as­sists per game.</p>
    <p>He will get a ring if the Lak­ers win, but he would also be el­i­gi­ble if the Heat clinch the vic­tory, pro­vided Mi­ami are will­ing to of­fer him one. The Heat, built around Jimmy But­ler who has av­er­aged 20.6 points, 4.3 as­sists and 6 re­bounds this post­sea­son, are un­der­dogs for the clash.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the sea­son tipped off 11 months ago, Mi­ami were re­garded as 60-1 shots of fin­ish­ing the cam­paign as cham­pi­ons. Some book­mak­ers pegged them at 110-1.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the sea­son restarted in Or­lando in July, the Heat were a gen­er­ous 30-1 to win the ti­tle, with the Mil­wau­kee Bucks ex­pected to emerge as the East­ern Con­fer­ence rep­re­sen­ta­tives in the Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“I just don’t think that we’re un­der­dogs,” But­ler said on Tues­day when asked to as­sess the Heat’s sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“So what that no­body picked us to be here? That’s okay. We’re just go­ing to go out here and com­pete, play to­gether like we al­ways have. We’re go­ing to do this our way, the Mi­ami Heat way.”</p>
