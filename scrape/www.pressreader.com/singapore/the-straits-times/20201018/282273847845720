    <p>When Mrs Hil­wah Brown watched daugh­ter Yas­min Aurora, then six, per­form at her Kin­der­garten 2 grad­u­a­tion con­cert last year in front of over 300 peo­ple, she be­came emo­tional.</p>
    <p>“I felt very proud that my girl could per­form on stage. The con­cert boosted the kids’ con­fi­dence level,” says Mrs Brown, 44, who runs a maid agency and has an el­der daugh­ter aged 10.</p>
    <p>She was im­pressed that her daugh­ter mem­o­rised the script for her lead role in a Willy Wonkain­spired English seg­ment and was able to sing Man­darin songs even though she is not Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>As her youngest child and only son, Har­ris, six, pre­pares to grad­u­ate from the same MapleBear pre-school this year, Mrs Brown ad­mits that his first school mile­stone is a bit­ter­sweet one.</p>
    <p>“I can­not be there to wit­ness my boy re­ceiv­ing the grad­u­a­tion cer­tifi­cate from the prin­ci­pal,” she says. “Har­ris wants mummy and daddy to be there to clap for him and take pic­tures, so he is a bit sad.”</p>
    <p>Across the is­land, pre-schools have been com­ing up with cre­ative ways to make the year-end cer­e­monies safe yet mean­ing­ful for the more than 34,000 chil­dren grad­u­at­ing from K2 dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Gone are the grand, au­di­to­ri­um­scale events that al­most re­sem­bled pop con­certs, with their elab­o­rate sets and throngs of ea­ger fam­ily mem­bers jostling for yet an­other photo of their pre­cious lit­tle ones.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing guide­lines set by the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency (ECDA), this year’s cer­e­monies will be held at class-level with no vis­i­tors, no mix­ing of classes and safe dis­tanc­ing even dur­ing per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>Brass and wind in­stru­ments are not al­lowed, while mi­cro­phones, cos­tumes and props can­not be shared. Grad­u­a­tion pho­tos must be taken in­di­vid­u­ally and each child’s gown must be laun­dered be­fore it can be reused.</p>
    <p>An ECDA spokesman ex­plains: “As pre-school premises are gen­er­ally smaller and more compact com­pared with other premises, there will be more im­pact on fam­i­lies in the event of any trans­mis­sion within the pre-school.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the many re­stric­tions, childcare cen­tres are ris­ing to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“Grad­u­a­tion this year may not look the same. But with a lit­tle cre­ativ­ity, we can hon­our our chil­dren’s ac­com­plish­ments and fo­cus on cel­e­brat­ing,” says Mr Ng Yi Xian, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the EtonHouse group.</p>
    <p>It will have a live-stream feed for the 200 pupils grad­u­at­ing i n De­cem­ber from its EtonHouse preschools, with live and pre-recorded seg­ments. Par­ents are in­vited to share speeches vir­tu­ally dur­ing the cer­e­mony, Mr Ng adds.</p>
    <p>Its K2 pupils will also show­case their grad­u­a­tion projects: in­clud­ing one on their EtonHouse mem­o­ries and stag­ing a Man­darin play ti­tled The Re­silient Seed.</p>
    <p>Over at its E-Bridge Pre-School, which of­fers af­ford­able childcare un­der the An­chor Op­er­a­tor Scheme, teach­ers in­volved 560 K2 chil­dren in the plan­ning of their grad­u­a­tion pro­duc­tions, which will be recorded for par­ents and, at some cen­tres, broad­cast live.</p>
    <p>Kin­der­land, which used to hold its K2 con­certs at venues such as the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Univer­sity Cul­tural Cen­tre with an au­di­ence of more than 1,000 peo­ple, is de­ter­mined to make sure “our chil­dren get the best chance to still have as much nor­malcy and as many ex­pe­ri­ences de­spite the pan­demic”, says Dr Carol Loy, its direc­tor of cur­ricu­lum and pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Over 200 grad­u­at­ing pupils will show­case val­ues such as team­work and friend­ship with per­for­mances such as play­ing mu­si­cal in­stru­ments in a group and danc­ing dur­ing its vir­tual cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, MapleBear Sin­ga­pore aims to con­tinue its tra­di­tion of gl­itzy pro­duc­tions with a con­cert in­spired by the mu­si­cals An­nie and Oliver Twist, ti­tled The Sun Will Come Out To­mor­row. CEO Pa­tri­cia Koh says the school “will con­tinue to make it spe­cial” for its 350 grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of pre-schools are get­ting par­ents in­volved in the grad­u­a­tion ex­pe­ri­ence as well.</p>
    <p>Some cen­tres un­der My World Preschool, which has al­most 900 K2 kids across 40 cen­tres, are en­cour­ag­ing their pupils to give a speech at home, which their par­ents will record. At other cen­tres, par­ents can record well-wishes for their kids, which will be shared as a sur­prise seg­ment dur­ing the cer­e­mony, says Dr May See, its se­nior gen­eral man­ager.</p>
    <p>At least one pre-school chain has ad­justed its cer­e­mony with the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion in mind. Star Learn­ers Group, which has about 630 K2 pupils across its 41 cen­tres, will live-stream its con­certs for free, and will forgo make-up and cos­tumes.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand that these are dif­fi­cult times and hope not to place any ad­di­tional fi­nan­cial stress on our par­ents,” ex­plains clus­ter prin­ci­pal Au­drey Chen. Its cen­tres will still pro­ceed with in­di­vid­ual grad­u­a­tion pho­tos and dig­i­tally stitch them to­gether for the class col­lages.</p>
    <p>In­clu­sive pre-school Kin­dle Gar­den will give its 20 grad­u­at­ing chil­dren a col­lage of class pho­tos and a video mon­tage at no charge, says its prin­ci­pal, Ms Sandy Koh.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre, which or­gan­ised a free overnight camp and ad­ven­ture walk for its K2 pupils last year, scrapped plans for a phys­i­cal event this year but is con­sid­er­ing hold­ing a vir­tual ses­sion for its grad­u­a­tion cer­e­mony af­ter re­ceiv­ing feed­back from par­ents.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, photo stu­dios re­port a spike in the num­ber of in­quiries from par­ents about K2 grad­u­a­tion pic­tures this year. Pho­tog­ra­pher Melody Lin, who runs Oh Dear Stu­dio, says she has “at least dou­ble or thrice the amount of in­ter­est and num­ber of ac­tual shoots” this year as par­ents look for some­thing more than “static” school vi­su­als.</p>
    <p>Mr Daniel Kuan, lead pho­tog­ra­pher at Pixel Workz Pho­tog­ra­phy, has seen a 40 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of in­quiries for such stu­dio shoots, but has had to turn them down as it lacks a phys­i­cal stu­dio and con­ducts shoots in schools in­stead.</p>
    <p>All the pre-schools in­ter­viewed say par­ents have taken the changes in their stride.</p>
    <p>Sales con­sul­tant Teo Tian You, 36, says apart from “slight dis­ap­point­ment we can’t see it live, we are still try­ing to make my daugh­ter feel like it’s a big event”.</p>
    <p>Rui Ling, five-and-a-half, is still ex­cited about her re­hearsals even though her E-Bridge cen­tre is giv­ing par­ents a record­ing of the pro­ceed­ings. Last year, she and her fam­ily watched her el­der brother Shen Jie’s con­cert live at an au­di­to­rium. He is now seven.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps the kids are still too young to see the dif­fer­ence be­tween do­ing it ex­ter­nally and do­ing a scaled-down ver­sion,” says Mr Teo, who has two other chil­dren aged three and seven months.</p>
    <p>As ed­u­ca­tors wrap up an ex­tra­or­di­nary year, they mar­vel at the tenac­ity and grit their young charges have shown through­out ev­ery com­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Even though it was a chal­lenge to chore­o­graph con­cert items with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in mind, the chil­dren en­joyed the process and were very co­op­er­a­tive dur­ing their reg­u­lar prac­tices,” says Ms Chen of Star Learn­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr See of My World Preschool adds: “We couldn’t be prouder of the chil­dren grad­u­at­ing this year as they have shown them­selves to be ex­tremely re­silient.”</p>
