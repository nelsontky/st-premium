    <p>Prop­erty por­tal 99 Group is hir­ing around 100 ad­di­tional tech­nol­ogy staff over the next 12 months to boost its tech work­force.</p>
    <p>These in­clude po­si­tions such as front- and back-end en­gi­neers, app de­vel­op­ers, prod­uct man­agers, user ex­pe­ri­ence and user in­ter­face de­sign­ers and data an­a­lysts, said the Sin­ga­pore-based firm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some of the job open­ings for po­si­tions in Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia are listed on its 99.co web­site.</p>
    <p>The firm also an­nounced that it has ap­pointed Mr Shivku­mar Kr­ish­nan as its chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Prior to the ap­point­ment, Mr Kr­ish­nan was di­rec­tor of en­gi­neer­ing at Cir­cles.Life and en­gi­neer­ing leader at Grab.</p>
    <p>The CTO ap­point­ment and hir­ing plans are meant to “ac­cel­er­ate the prop­erty por­tal’s tech in­no­va­tion for an evolv­ing real es­tate in­dus­try”, as prop­erty hunt­ing in­creas­ingly shifts on­line, said the firm.</p>
    <p>It added that the push to ex­pand its pool of tech pro­fes­sion­als is “all the more i mpor­tant” as the Covid-19 pan­demic has has­tened dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion in the prop­erty buy­ing and sell­ing process.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty por­tal brands un­der the start-up in­clude 99.co, iprop­erty.com.sg and rumah123.com</p>
    <p>Call­ing Covid-19 a “game changer”, 99 Group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Dar­ius Che­ung said the firm is lever­ag­ing tech­nol­ogy to de­liver a bet­ter ex­pe­ri­ence for prop­erty seek­ers.</p>
    <p>“As an in­creas­ing por­tion of the en­tire home search and pur­chase process shifts on­line, our plat­form has fa­cil­i­tated many trans­ac­tions through tools such as live video view­ings,” he said.</p>
    <p>The firm said it re­ceived five times the num­ber of video list­ings on its plat­forms in the first half of this year. Even af­ter phys­i­cal home view­ings re­sumed, home seek­ers con­tin­ued to show high in­ter­est in such video list­ings on its plat­forms, it added.</p>
