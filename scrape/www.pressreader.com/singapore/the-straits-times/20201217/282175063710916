    <p>Three Sin­ga­porean men ac­cused of com­mit­ting crimes re­lated to ob­tain­ing the per­sonal de­tails of Sing­tel and StarHub cus­tomers were charged in a district court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Kelvin Foo Cheek Ann, 32, and Zhang Ji­azheng, 38, are said to have used com­put­ers at their work­places to il­lic­itly ac­cess the sub­scriber data­bases of Sing­tel and StarHub re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The third man, Philbert Lim Zong Xian, 33, faces three charges for al­legedly brib­ing an­other man, Lee Cheng Yan, 37, with a to­tal of $1,000 to get cus­tomers’ de­tails from the tel­cos in 2017.</p>
    <p>Foo faces 15 charges un­der the Com­puter Mis­use and Cy­ber­se­cu­rity Act, in­clud­ing al­legedly get­ting in­for­ma­tion re­lated to the ad­dress of Lee’s for­mer girl­friend in 2014.</p>
    <p>He is also ac­cused of ac­cept­ing $180 from Lee in 2016 in re­turn for re­triev­ing con­fi­den­tial de­tails of Sing­tel cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Zhang faces nine counts of know­ingly us­ing a com­puter at his work­place to ac­cess StarHub sub­scribers’ de­tails be­tween 2015 and 2017.</p>
    <p>Lee was charged in 2018 over var­i­ous of­fences and his case is pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Lim, Zhang and Foo are sched­uled to be in court next on Jan 13.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Zhang’s hear­ing yes­ter­day, StarHub said it takes data se­cu­rity very se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>The firm had re­voked Zhang’s ac­cess to its sys­tem and sus­pended him when the case arose three years ago. He was fired in 2017 af­ter its in­ves­ti­ga­tions found he had breached the em­ploy­ees’ code of con­duct.</p>
    <p>StarHub added: “We also tight­ened our sys­tems and pro­cesses as well as con­ducted ad­di­tional staff aware­ness train­ing on data pro­tec­tion, to fur­ther safe­guard StarHub in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of us­ing a com­puter to se­cure ac­cess to data with­out au­thor­ity can be jailed for up to two years, fined up to $5,000, or both.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers can be jailed for up to three years, fined up to $10,000, or both.</p>
