    <p>As Iran moves to fi­nalise a mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar trade and mil­i­tary agree­ment with China, one of its key in­fra­struc­ture projects in­volv­ing In­dia ap­pears to have run into prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Te­heran has had to deny In­dian me­dia re­ports that it has ousted</p>
    <p>In­dia from the rail­way project con­nect­ing Iran’s Chaba­har Port to its border with Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>Since 2003, In­dia has been in­volved in de­vel­op­ing Chaba­har Port, which gives it ac­cess to Afghanista­n and Cen­tral Asia. Neigh­bour­ing Pak­istan has been re­luc­tant to give In­dia ac­cess to Afghanista­n through its ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s in­volve­ment in the rail­way project be­came un­cer­tain af­ter Te­heran started work on it ear­lier this month on its own.</p>
    <p>Mr Saeed Ra­souli, Iran’s Deputy Min­is­ter of Roads and head of Iran Rail­ways, told In­dian High Com­mis­sioner Gad­dam Dhar­men­dra on Mon­day that “vested in­ter­ests were be­hind re­cent re­ports that Iran ex­cluded In­dia from the Chaba­har-Za­hedan rail­way project”, the In­dian Em­bassy in Iran said in a tweet. It also said both sides had re­viewed co­op­er­a­tion on the project.</p>
    <p>But nei­ther side has clar­i­fied In­dia’s role in the rail­way project.</p>
    <p>In­dian rail­way con­struc­tion firm Ir­con had com­pleted a fea­si­bil­ity study on the rail­way line last year, three years af­ter it signed an agree­ment with the Con­struc­tion, De­vel­op­ment of Trans­port and In­fra­struc­ture Com­pany of Iran to pro­vide ser­vices for the build­ing of the Chaba­har-Za­hedan rail­way.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal</p>
    <p>Af­fairs spokesman Anurag Srivastava has said Iran has to take the fi­nal de­ci­sion on nom­i­nat­ing a com­pany to fi­nalise the tech­ni­cal and fi­nan­cial is­sues sur­round­ing the project.</p>
    <p>There is also lit­tle clar­ity on whether the rail­way project is ex­empt from US sanc­tions, im­posed on Iran be­cause of its nu­clear pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The long civil­i­sa­tional and tra­di­tional ties be­tween In­dia and Iran have been un­der strain amid years of US pres­sure on New Delhi to cut back on its ex­po­sure to Iran.</p>
    <p>US sanc­tions have made it dif­fi­cult for In­dia to main­tain trade ties with Iran or move fast on the cru­cial Chaba­har Port project.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts say the project is an im­por­tant area of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“In­dia is rea­son­ably well po­si­tioned, be­cause at the end of the day, the one country that has de­liv­ered in Iran de­spite all the prob­lems is In­dia. (Chaba­har) is op­er­a­tional; it is a re­mark­able achieve­ment. But In­dia can’t make the port op­er­a­tional to a point that it be­comes a hub. That will hap­pen only if Iran be­comes a global ac­tor and more tankers and for­eign com­pa­nies come to the port,” noted Pro­fes­sor Harsh V. Pant from the Observer Re­search Foun­da­tion think-tank in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of con­ster­na­tion (in In­dia over what has hap­pened) with the rail­way line. If you look at the evo­lu­tion of Chaba­har,</p>
    <p>Iran has said it is open to ev­ery­one else, even Pak­istan. They (Iran) have al­ways used it (Chaba­har) as lever­age.”</p>
    <p>Te­heran has con­tin­ued to feel that In­dia has not done as much as it could and has of­ten com­plained of New Delhi suc­cumb­ing to pres­sure from Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Still, In­dian Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar noted on Mon­day in re­sponse to a ques­tion un­re­lated to Iran that In­dia was “never part of an al­liance sys­tem and we will never be”.</p>
    <p>His re­marks came amid spec­u­la­tion that In­dia would grow closer to the US amid re­cent border trou­bles with China.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Iran’s grow­ing links with China are be­ing watched and an­a­lysed in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>“Iran is a be­lea­guered country. If you were Iran, you would look around for partners and friends. China is a very im­por­tant part­ner for them. Iran needs in­vest­ments and tech­nol­ogy and de­fence sup­port,” noted former di­plo­mat Talmiz Ah­mad, adding that the per­cep­tion in Te­heran was that In­dia was in the US corner.</p>
