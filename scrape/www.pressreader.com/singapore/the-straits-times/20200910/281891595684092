    <p>Twit­ter in In­dia is see­ing a cen­tu­ry­old lin­guis­tic move­ment re-emerge as an ir­rev­er­ent Tamil pride cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Film artists and politi­cians are shar­ing pho­tos of them­selves and oth­ers in T-shirts that say “I am a Tamil-speak­ing In­dian”, and that are em­bla­zoned with Tamil lit­er­ary icons. The hash­tags #HindiIm­po­si­tion and #HindiTheri­yad­huPoda” (I don’t know Hindi, get lost) in Tamil have re­ceived over 200,000 tweets in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Young Tamils are assert­ing pride in their mother tongue with film video clips, memes and slo­gans that re­it­er­ate, i n cheeky new ways, Tamil Nadu’s decades-old op­po­si­tion to any fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s at­tempts to im­pose Hindi in schools or work­places.</p>
    <p>The move­ment is in re­sponse to a se­ries of in­ci­dents, in­clud­ing one tweeted by Ms Kan­i­mozhi, a par­lia­men­tar­ian from Thoothukud­i in Tamil Nadu. On Aug 9, she al­leged that an air­port se­cu­rity guard in Chennai asked her if she was In­dian when she did not speak Hindi.</p>
    <p>“I am not less of an In­dian be­cause I don’t speak Hindi. I’m not against any lan­guage but this kind of stealth im­po­si­tion of Hindi can’t be hap­pen­ing in a di­verse coun­try like In­dia,” Ms Kan­i­mozhi told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the last In­dian cen­sus, 43.6 per cent of In­di­ans speak</p>
    <p>Hindi, but it is not the na­tional lan­guage. In­dia of­fi­cially recog­nises 23 lan­guages, in­clud­ing English, Hindi and Tamil.</p>
    <p>“There is a mis­con­cep­tion among many that Hindi is the na­tional lan­guage, and a lot of non-Hindi speak­ers feel pres­sured to speak it,” said Ms Kan­i­mozhi.</p>
    <p>Her half-brother M.K. Stalin, chief of Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Mun­netra Kazhagam party, told the press in re­sponse to her en­counter: “Is this In­dia or Hin­dia?”</p>
    <p>Tamil Nadu, for­merly known as Madras Pres­i­dency, has op­posed the im­po­si­tion of Hindi and San­skrit since the 1940s, as part of the Dra­vid­ian move­ment’s ide­o­log­i­cal bat­tles against up­per caste dom­i­na­tion and Hindu na­tion­al­ism. Since 1965, af­ter Tamils ag­i­tated against an at­tempt to make Hindi the sole of­fi­cial lan­guage in In­dia, English was in­cluded as an of­fi­cial lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Tamil Nadu has since had a twolan­guage pol­icy, and Tamil and English are taught in schools there.</p>
    <p>“It is a his­tor­i­cal strug­gle to as­sert Tamil as a clas­si­cal and liv­ing lan­guage. But there are prac­ti­cal re­al­i­ties too. Decades of the two-lan­guage pol­icy in Tamil Nadu have pro­duced a whole unilin­gual gen­er­a­tion. Most peo­ple, es­pe­cially over the age of 30, don’t know Hindi, and they don’t need to be hu­mil­i­ated for that,” said Tamil play­wright A. Man­gai.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Tamil Nadu gov­ern­ment op­posed a rec­om­men­da­tion for a three-lan­guage pol­icy in In­dia’s new ed­u­ca­tion pol­icy draft, see­ing it as a way to sneak Hindi in</p>
    <p>di­rectly into ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In the same month, a vi­ral video showed Mr Rajesh Kotecha, the Sec­re­tary of the Min­istry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Natur­opa­thy, Unani, Sid­dha and Homeopa­thy, ask­ing par­tic­i­pants who did not know Hindi to leave an on­line train­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>With state elec­tions due next year, po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts say the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – which came to power in Delhi in 2014 – has been build­ing sup­port around its core is­sue of a broad Hindu na­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>But Dra­vid­ian par­ties dom­i­nate in Tamil Nadu, with long-es­tab­lished re­gional iden­tity pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The re­cent pro-Tamil slo­gans re­claim pride of coun­try and re­gional iden­tity. But Tamil Nadu’s BJP trea­surer S.R. Sekar dis­missed the new move­ment as just an ad­ver­tise­ment for sell­ing T-shirts.</p>
    <p>Mr Karthikeya­n, a small man­u­fac­turer of gar­ments in Tirupur, does not mind. He has re­ceived “hun­dreds of or­ders” for T-shirts with the slo­gan “Tamil-speak­ing In­dian” in the past week.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 killed my busi­ness but Tamil pride is re­viv­ing it,” he said.</p>
