    <p>BANGKOK • The heir to the Red Bull en­ergy drink for­tune is be­lieved to have been driv­ing much faster than ini­tially thought when he was in­volved in a fa­tal hit-an­drun in 2012, a pros­e­cu­tion spokesman said yes­ter­day, in a case that has stirred anger in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Deputy spokesman Prayut Phetkun said the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s of­fice would rec­om­mend that the po­lice rein­ves­ti­gate the case due to dis­crep­ancy over the ve­hi­cle’s speed.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth Yoovid­hya was ac­cused of crash­ing his Fer­rari into po­lice­man Wichien Klan­prasert and drag­ging his body for dozens of me­tres, be­fore al­legedly flee­ing the scene.</p>
    <p>He missed eight sum­monses to ap­pear in court and his case raised an­gry ques­tions about im­punity for the rich.</p>
    <p>He was even­tu­ally charged with reck­less driv­ing caus­ing death, with a statute of lim­i­ta­tions un­til 2027, but his where­abouts are not known.</p>
    <p>Last month, in a sur­prise move, the po­lice said that the charges against him were be­ing dropped.</p>
    <p>But that de­ci­sion was ques­tioned in Par­lia­ment and else­where, and the po­lice, gov­ern­ment and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s of­fice all said that they would in­ves­ti­gate.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut said new ev­i­dence had been found about the speed at which Mr Vo­rayuth was be­lieved to have been driv­ing when he crashed into the po­lice­man, who was on a mo­tor­cy­cle, on a Bangkok street.</p>
    <p>“This case is not over be­cause the law says if there is new ev­i­dence, we are able to pro­ceed,” Mr Prayut told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the speed of Mr Vo­rayuth’s Fer­rari at the time of the ac­ci­dent was said to be 80kmh, but Mr Prayut said that ac­cord­ing to an ex­pert opin­ion not pre­vi­ously in­cluded in the po­lice re­port, the speed was closer to 170kmh.</p>
    <p>“This is new ev­i­dence ac­cord­ing to the law,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth could also face a new charge be­cause blood tests af­ter the ac­ci­dent showed traces of co­caine, but he was not charged at the time due to a pos­si­ble false pos­i­tive from the use of other med­i­ca­tion, Mr Prayut said.</p>
    <p>Mr Vo­rayuth is the grand­son of the late Cha­leo Yoovid­hya, cre­ator of the Krat­ing Daeng, or Red Bull, en­ergy drink. He was 27 at the time of the ac­ci­dent.</p>
