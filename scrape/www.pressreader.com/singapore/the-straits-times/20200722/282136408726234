    <p>One of Aus­tralia and New Zealand Bank­ing Group’s (ANZ) most se­nior traders is su­ing the bank for defama­tion over its crit­i­cism of his social me­dia post.</p>
    <p>In early March, Mr Bo­gac Ozdemir, a Singapore-based global head of credit at the bank, wrote a post on LinkedIn that blamed China for the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and crit­i­cised the state of Amer­i­can so­ci­ety and pol­i­tics. Af­ter his com­ments on China were at­tacked on social me­dia, ANZ is­sued a state­ment say­ing the post did not re­flect its views and “showed a dis­tinct lack of judg­ment”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ozdemir claims that the bank’s com­ments were defam­a­tory and is seek­ing dam­ages of not less than US$20 mil­lion (S$27.8 mil­lion), ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers seen by Bloomberg. He also al­leges that the ANZ state­ment was “made in re­sponse to pres­sure ap­plied by Chi­nese fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tors”.</p>
    <p>He filed the civil ac­tion in New York, ac­cord­ing to the sum­mons dated July 8.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Mel­bournebase­d ANZ Bank de­clined to com­ment, as did Mr Ozdemir. ANZ has yet to file a re­sponse to the fil­ing.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Ozdemir pro­vided a copy of the now-deleted post which sparked the con­tro­versy to Bloomberg. Mr Ozdemir, whose full ti­tle is global head of credit, local markets and G4 rates trad­ing, has been at ANZ for seven years, ac­cord­ing to his LinkedIn pro­file. He now re­sides in New Jersey, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ing.</p>
