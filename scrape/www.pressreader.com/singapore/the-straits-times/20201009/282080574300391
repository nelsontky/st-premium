    <p>Aus­tralian For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne, who is in Sin­ga­pore on a three-day of­fi­cial visit, called on Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and was hosted to lunch by For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>PM Lee and Ms Payne reaf­firmed the ex­cel­lent re­la­tions be­tween both coun­tries and ex­changed views on a range of re­gional and in­ter­na­tional is­sues, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) said.</p>
    <p>They dis­cussed how both sides are tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic and tak­ing steps to­wards eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said in a Face­book post that this year marks the fifth an­niver­sary of the sign­ing of the Com­pre­hen­sive Strate­gic Part­ner­ship (CSP) be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the Covid-19 dis­rup­tions, we have made sig­nif­i­cant progress in key ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion un­der the CSP,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“Min­is­ter Payne and I had a good dis­cus­sion on how we can do more to­gether amid the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dr Balakr­ish­nan and Ms Payne noted the good progress on the wide-rang­ing co­op­er­a­tion un­der the CSP, as well as the good co­op­er­a­tion be­tween both coun­tries amid Covid-19, such as in vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and sup­port­ing vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>“They also dis­cussed how both coun­tries could work to­gether to re­open bor­ders in a safe and grad­ual man­ner,” MFA added.</p>
    <p>Last week, Sin­ga­pore an­nounced the uni­lat­eral lift­ing of bor­der re­stric­tions on vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia – ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state – and Viet­nam, as of yes­ter­day. It has also lifted bor­der re­stric­tions on vis­i­tors from Brunei and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has kept its re­stric­tions on vis­i­tors, but an­nounced last week that from next Fri­day, New Zealan­ders will be able to visit New South Wales and the North­ern Ter­ri­tory with­out un­der­go­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>In her role as Min­is­ter for Women, Ms Payne also met Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment as well as Education Sun Xuel­ing. They had a good dis­cus­sion on women’s is­sues, MFA said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun shared the re­cent launch of con­ver­sa­tions to iden­tify and tackle is­sues af­fect­ing Sin­ga­pore women, while Ms Payne said that the con­ver­sa­tions are timely and she looked for­ward to the re­sults.</p>
    <p>They also dis­cussed is­sues such as fam­ily vi­o­lence and em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for women, and how Covid-19 has im­pacted them, MFA added.</p>
