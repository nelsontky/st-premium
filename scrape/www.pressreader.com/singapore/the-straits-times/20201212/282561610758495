    <p>MADRID • Af­ter mak­ing their best start to a sea­son since they last won the La Liga ti­tle in 2013-14, Atletico Madrid can con­sol­i­date their early prom­ise and twist the knife into their city ri­vals when they visit Real Madrid to­day.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory will send the lead­ers nine points clear of the fourth­placed de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons (20) on top of hav­ing a game in hand, send­ing out the clear­est mes­sage yet that they mean busi­ness this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Atletico be­came the first club in 10 years to break up the du­op­oly of Real and Barcelona in La Liga. Diego Sime­one’s men, how­ever, have not been able to build on their Span­ish league ti­tle suc­cess since, de­spite main­tain­ing their place in the top four.</p>
    <p>But fol­low­ing an un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally quiet sum­mer that saw Real fail to make any sign­ings for the first time in 40 years, while Barca had to off­load high earn­ers like Luis Suarez be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Atletico ap­pear far more equipped for a ti­tle tilt than Spain’s big two.</p>
    <p>They are the only un­beaten side in La Liga – their last de­feat was on Feb 1 by Real, dat­ing back 26 games – and they have scored more goals per game than anyone else while con­ced­ing only twice in 10 matches.</p>
    <p>Atletico have also shed their rep­u­ta­tion as a con­ser­va­tive side fo­cused only on de­fence and now boast an of­fence com­pris­ing Joao Felix, Suarez, Mar­cos Llorente and Yan­nick Car­rasco.</p>
    <p>Their at­tack­ing ap­proach has helped them find so­lu­tions in tight games, ex­tend­ing their win­ning streak in La Liga to seven, yet their back­line re­mains as tight as ever with a league-lead­ing eight clean sheets.</p>
    <p>That con­sis­tency, in­clud­ing beat­ing Barca in the league for the first time in a decade, has con­trasted with Real’s stut­ter­ing ti­tle de­fence, as Zine­dine Zi­dane’s side have lost three times al­ready in the league and have just one vic­tory from their past four games.</p>
    <p>The ban on fans at­tend­ing games has also al­lowed Sime­one to show he is more than just an an­i­mated cheer­leader on the side­line and prove he is a coach who har­nesses real im­prove­ment in play­ers.</p>
    <p>Llorente is a case in point. Con­sid­ered sur­plus to re­quire­ments at Real, he made the de­ci­sion to cross the Madrid di­vide last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Sime­one has since turned him from a hold­ing mid­fielder into a for­ward and the switch is pay­ing div­i­dends with four league goals and a maiden Spain cap this term.</p>
    <p>Still, he knows the hosts re­main a team who can de­liver when their backs are against the wall, hav­ing al­ready beaten Barca, In­ter Mi­lan twice, and Sevilla this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing his side to keep their feet on the ground even if they lay down a marker, Sime­one said ahead of the game at the Al­fredo di Ste­fano Sta­dium: “I don’t con­sider it to be the end (of the ti­tle race) with so many match days to go.</p>
    <p>“Madrid are an ex­cel­lent team, they un­der­stand their play­ers so well and al­ways thrive when the pres­sure is on.”</p>
    <p>Real are still miss­ing Eden Haz­ard and Fed­erico Valverde but oth­er­wise have a full squad to pick from, while Atletico will be with­out Jose Gimenez and Diego Costa.</p>
    <p>We are al­ways look­ing to the next game, we don’t get caught up in what we are do­ing. In foot­ball, you live for what hap­pens next week.</p>
    <p>DIEGO SIME­ONE, coach of sur­prise La Liga lead­ers Atletico Madrid, on look­ing at the team’s per­for­mance rather league po­si­tion.</p>
