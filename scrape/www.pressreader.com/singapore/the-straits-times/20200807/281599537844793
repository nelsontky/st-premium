    <p>Work-from-home ar­range­ments will con­tinue in or­der to guard against po­ten­tial Covid-19 trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should con­tinue to keep this as the de­fault ar­range­ment un­less em­ploy­ees have a demon­stra­ble need to re­turn to the work­place, such as to use spe­cialised equip­ment, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong at a vir­tual multi-min­istry press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He noted that work­ing from home has been ben­e­fi­cial on nu­mer­ous fronts, such as re­duc­ing con­ges­tion on pub­lic trans­port and min­imis­ing the num­ber of peo­ple com­ing to­gether in the work­place.</p>
    <p>This, Mr Wong said, has helped to keep com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion at bay.</p>
    <p>The task force is re­view­ing the work-from-home ar­range­ment and may mod­ify the rules, fol­low­ing ap­peals and feed­back from em­ploy­ers who have re­quested more flex­i­bil­ity, said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the coro­n­avirus pandemic.</p>
    <p>“We’ve re­ceived these ap­peals, we are still study­ing the mat­ter and to see if there may be some change or some mod­i­fi­ca­tion to the work-from-home re­quire­ment,” Mr Wong ex­plained.</p>
    <p>He added that some in­di­vid­u­als have said the ar­range­ment has in­creased their pro­duc­tiv­ity, while oth­ers ex­plained that the home en­vi­ron­ment is not suf­fi­ciently con­ducive for work as be­ing to­gether with their col­leagues ac­tu­ally helps to boost pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“But I should say that even if we were to al­low some mod­i­fi­ca­tion or ad­just­ments, we would still like to see, as far as pos­si­ble, a high de­gree of peo­ple work­ing from home,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of em­ploy­ees here have been work­ing from home since the cir­cuit breaker started in early April. A re­port in May showed that in a sur­vey of 9,000 re­spon­dents from al­most 90 com­pa­nies, nine in 10 em­ploy­ees want to con­tinue work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Some of the perks em­ploy­ees have en­joyed in­clude not hav­ing to com­mute to and from work, more flex­i­bil­ity with their time, and greater con­trol over work-life bal­ance, ac­cord­ing to the sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Most re­spon­dents also said they save money on of­fice wear, eat­ing out and trans­port ex­penses such as fuel and park­ing. How­ever, they have to spend more on elec­tric­ity bills, Wi-Fi boost­ers and print­ers.</p>
