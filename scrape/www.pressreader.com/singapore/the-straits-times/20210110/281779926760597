    <p>PARIS • One of France’s lead­ing po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tors is fac­ing a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter be­ing ac­cused of the sex­ual abuse of his step­son, in the lat­est taboo-break­ing scan­dal to rock the French in­tel­lec­tual elite.</p>
    <p>Mr Olivier Duhamel, 70, who has de­scribed the in­cest al­le­ga­tions as “per­sonal at­tacks”, is ac­cused in a new book, writ­ten by his step­daugh­ter Camille Kouch­ner, of abus­ing her twin brother when they were aged 14.</p>
    <p>Paris pros­e­cu­tors said last Tues­day they were open­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Mr Duhamel over sus­pected rape and sex­ual abuse of a mi­nor by a per­son in au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>He has stepped down from all his me­dia and aca­demic posts amid the furore.</p>
    <p>The book, La Fa­milia Grande, has shocked French in­tel­lec­tual cir­cles given Mr Duhamel’s promi­nence and close con­nec­tions to the elite.</p>
    <p>While many com­men­ta­tors have cast France as be­ing slow to break long­stand­ing taboos over the abuse of mi­nors, this is not the first such con­tro­versy to make head­lines over the last year.</p>
    <p>Pub­lisher Vanessa Springora, in a book pub­lished last Jan­uary ac­cused prize-win­ning writer Gabriel Matzn­eff of abus­ing her while she was a mi­nor.</p>
    <p>Film star Adele Haenel in Novem­ber 2019 ac­cused direc­tor</p>
    <p>Christophe Rug­gia of sex­u­ally ha­rass­ing her when she was in her early teens.</p>
    <p>Haenel and other French ac­tresses walked out of France’s Ce­sar awards last Fe­bru­ary af­ter Ro­man Polan­ski – wanted in the United States for the statu­tory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977 – won best direc­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Duhamel said on Twit­ter that he was re­sign­ing from all his posts fol­low­ing the al­le­ga­tions, in­clud­ing as head of the Na­tional Foun­da­tion of Po­lit­i­cal Sci­ences, which over­sees the hugely pres­ti­gious Sci­ences Po univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“I am step­ping down from my posts af­ter be­ing the tar­get of per­sonal at­tacks as I want to pre­serve the in­sti­tu­tions in which I work,” said Mr Duhamel, who also un­til now pre­sented a show on Europe 1 ra­dio and is an an­a­lyst on LCI TV.</p>
    <p>Ms Kouch­ner, now 45 and a lec­turer, and her twin brother are the chil­dren of France’s for­mer for­eign min­is­ter and co-founder of the Medecins Sans Fron­tieres med­i­cal char­ity Bernard Kouch­ner and aca­demic Eve­lyne Pisier.</p>
    <p>The par­ents sep­a­rated and Ms Pisier went on to marry Mr Duhamel.</p>
    <p>“I was 14 years old and let it go ahead. I was 14, I knew and said noth­ing,” Ms Kouch­ner wrote in the book.</p>
    <p>She names her brother only as “Vic­tor” in the book to shield his pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>But Le Monde daily said he had read the text twice and was happy for her to speak on his be­half.</p>
    <p>“I con­firm that what my sis­ter has writ­ten con­cern­ing the ac­tions of Olivier Duhamel to­wards me is cor­rect,” he said.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with L’Obs magazine, Ms Kouch­ner said the book re­vealed to what ex­tent Mr Duhamel’s and Ms Pisier’s group of left­ist in­tel­lec­tual friends, some of them house­hold names in France, knew what was go­ing on.</p>
    <p>“Of course, I thought my book might seem ob­scene be­cause of my fam­ily’s fame,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Then I thought to my­self, this is ex­actly what needs to be done.”</p>
    <p>In the book, she al­leges a de facto omerta had pro­tected her step­fa­ther from the truth be­ing widely known.</p>
    <p>“Very quickly, the people i n power, Saint-Ger­main-des-Pres (the tra­di­tional hub in Paris for left­ist thinkers), were aware. Many knew and most acted as if noth­ing had hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>The book says that af­ter his mother’s death in 2017, “Vic­tor” told his fa­ther about what had hap­pened.</p>
    <p>He pledged to con­front Mr Duhamel but was per­suaded against do­ing so by Ms Kouch­ner her­self, on the grounds that “Vic­tor” wanted the fam­ily to move on.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment re­leased by his lawyer, Mr Kouch­ner said a “heavy se­cret that has been weigh­ing on us for too long has hap­pily been lifted”.</p>
    <p>“I ap­plaud the courage of my daugh­ter Camille.”</p>
