    <p>It is wor­ry­ing that on­line scams should con­tinue to scar Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety in spite of the ex­ten­sive pub­lic­ity that has been put out in the me­dia and by way of pub­lic education posters at MRT sta­tions and else­where. The po­lice han­dled 7,253 cases across 10 main cat­e­gories of scams in the six months to June 30 – a whop­ping 139 per cent jump from the 3,027 in­ci­dents in the same pe­riod last year. The main cat­e­gories were e-com­merce and so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation ruses, fol­lowed by loan and bank­ing-re­lated phish­ing fraud cases. Other com­mon types in­volved credit-for-sex rack­ets, sus­pi­cious in­vest­ment of­fers, In­ter­net love scams and cases where fraud­sters im­per­son­ated of­fi­cials from China. Scam­mers are get­ting richer as well. The 10 main fraud cat­e­gories re­sulted in vic­tims los­ing $82 mil­lion – 97.1 per cent up on the $41.6 mil­lion lost in the first half of last year.</p>
    <p>Clearly, scams have worked and taken ad­van­tage of those who are gullible and inat­ten­tive. In the case of the lat­est sta­tis­tics, some of the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties to scams ap­peared to stem from the in­se­cu­ri­ties ex­pe­ri­enced by Sin­ga­pore­ans dur­ing the pun­ish­ing Covid-19 pe­riod. Fraud­sters suc­ceeded in in­sert­ing them­selves into an on­line sphere where more peo­ple were mak­ing pur­chases, com­mu­ni­cat­ing and in­ter­act­ing. How­ever, their fun­da­men­tal tac­tics re­mained the same: They lay in the abil­ity to ex­ploit psy­cho­log­i­cal states so vic­tims would re­spond in ways that they would not nor­mally do, such as by shar­ing one-time pass­words.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse lies in con­tin­u­ing to in­cul­cate ha­bit­ual vig­i­lance so fraud­sters have less scope to op­er­ate. Scams did not be­gin yes­ter­day. In­stead, pub­lic education warn­ings are so fa­mil­iar that it is dif­fi­cult to see how much more the au­thor­i­ties can do. The po­lice can act only when a crime has been com­mit­ted, and it is dif­fi­cult to in­ter­vene ear­lier. It is up to Sin­ga­pore­ans to learn from the ex­pe­ri­ences of vic­tims in their midst, and stay safe.</p>
