    <p>Malaysian cafe owner Nona Zain­ud­din turns ca­cao beans sourced from lo­cal farms into cho­co­late bars and drinks that her cus­tomers just love. The 35g bars are sold for RM13 (S$4.30) each.</p>
    <p>“We want to play a role in the lo­cal ca­cao com­mu­nity, in show­cas­ing the po­ten­tial of Malaysian ca­cao in terms of flavour, sin­gle ori­gin, bean-to-bar process and how lo­cal cho­co­late can be bet­ter than im­ported cho­co­late,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Her cus­tomer base has been grow­ing steadily since she opened the Sen­i­man Kakao cafe with busi­ness part­ner Michael Wilson 18 months ago in Pudu near Bukit Bin­tang, Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>A grow­ing ap­petite for cho­co­late con­sump­tion has meant that Malaysia’s co­coa in­dus­try is strug­gling to keep up with or­ders, even as the coun­try tries to shake off the decades-long de­pen­dence on oil palm as one of its big­gest ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Malaysia, which is al­ready well known for its oil palm and rub­ber plan­ta­tions, may now profit from its ca­cao beans.</p>
    <p>“Busi­ness is good, there is good de­mand. Malaysia can­not cope. We can­not pro­duce enough co­coa,” grower Chin Wee Kheong told ST, adding that he has been look­ing for months for a suitable piece of land to ex­pand his 16ha farm, which he started six years ago in Rem­bau, Negeri Sem­bi­lan, about an hour’s drive from the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Co­coa refers to roasted beans used for pro­cessed cho­co­late, while ca­cao refers to un­roasted beans.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Malaysian Co­coa Board, world co­coa de­mand, mea­sured by co­coa grind­ings or co­coa con­sump­tion, in­creased to 4.75 mil­lion tonnes in 2018/2019 from 3.537 mil­lion tonnes in 2008/2009. That is a growth of about 3.5 per cent an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Co­coa grind­ings in Malaysia have risen over the past five years from 188,000 tonnes in 2015 to 344,000 last year, mak­ing the coun­try the world’s sixth-largest co­coa sup­plier. While co­coa grind­ings in the first quar­ter of the year were 74,831 tonnes, pro­duc­tion re­mains low.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the board, the av­er­age an­nual co­coa pro­duc­tiv­ity was 2,032kg per ha in 2008. It has now fallen to as low as 137kg per ha for es­tates and 90kg per ha for small farms, also known as small­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket price volatil­ity, the weak­en­ing of the ring­git since 2014 and low co­coa prices since 2016 have hit grow­ers, who also lose be­tween 30 per cent and 50 per cent of out­put an­nu­ally to pests and dis­ease.</p>
    <p>All th­ese have con­trib­uted to the de­cline in the co­coa in­dus­try from when it used to be a main crop in the 1980s, be­fore the emer­gence of oil palm as the coun­try’s cash crop.</p>
    <p>But now, there is po­ten­tial for growth. Due to un­pre­dictable mar­ket prices and pressure from an­tipalm oil lobby groups in the West, Malaysia is seek­ing to move away from its de­pen­dence on oil palm.</p>
    <p>Co­coa ex­ports hit RM6.6 bil­lion last year, Plan­ta­tion In­dus­tries and Commoditie­s Min­is­ter Mohd Khairud­din Aman Razali said last month. I n 2018, ex­ports were worth RM5.55 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian Co­coa Board said prospects for co­coa up­stream ac­tiv­i­ties, such as cho­co­late mak­ing, look bright, thanks to a grow­ing trend in the global co­coa in­dus­try for sin­gle­o­ri­gin or bean-to-bar cho­co­late, made us­ing beans from one geographic ori­gin, which fetches higher prices.</p>
    <p>While ma­jor co­coa pro­ces­sors, such as Swiss-based Barry Calle­baut, buy co­coa beans in bulk from around the world to turn them into co­coa and cho­co­late prod­ucts, dis­cern­ing cho­co­late con­nois­seurs say not all beans taste the same.</p>
    <p>Beans, they add, dif­fer ac­cord­ing to ori­gin, soil and grow­ing con­di­tions. Th­ese con­nois­seurs in­sist that the bean-to-bar process results in higher-qual­ity bars and a more nu­anced taste.</p>
    <p>Also, more con­sumers are turn­ing away from mass-pro­duced, highly pro­cessed foods in favour of sin­gle-ori­gin, bean-to-bar prod­ucts, where mak­ers such as Sen­i­man Kakao con­trol every step of the cho­co­late-mak­ing process, from ca­cao bean to cho­co­late bar.</p>
    <p>With cho­co­late lovers will­ing to pay higher prices for pu­rity, Malaysian grow­ers earn around 30 per cent more when bean-to-bar cho­co­late mak­ers source beans di­rectly from them. Beans that nor­mally sell for RM7 a kg can fetch up to RM12 when traded as sin­gle-ori­gin cho­co­late.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Malaysia’s low out­put is mak­ing lo­cal pro­ces­sors seek al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor-based Guan Chong, the world’s fourth-largest co­coa grinder and Asia’s largest, is mov­ing to be closer to African and South Amer­i­can grow­ers.</p>
    <p>The group, which buys beans and pro­cesses them into choco­late­based in­gre­di­ents for con­fec­tionery and bev­er­age mak­ers, such as Nes­tle and Her­shey, is spend­ing €25 mil­lion (S$40 mil­lion) this year on the con­struc­tion of a new plant in the Ivory Coast. This will boost its grind­ing ca­pac­ity to 310,000 tonnes per year, from 250,000 tonnes per year in to­tal at its fac­to­ries in Pasir Gu­dang, Jo­hor and Batam cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Real­is­ing that the in­dus­try has un­tapped po­ten­tial, the govern­ment is plan­ning new pro­grammes this year to give it a much-needed boost, pro­vid­ing funds and grants to en­trepreneur­s, and set­ting up a cho­co­late en­tre­pre­neur hub on Langkawi is­land.</p>
    <p>As for Mr Chin, he is count­ing on the price of beans to rise, along with de­mand. “Prices are ex­pected to go up to RM12-RM15, and up to RM18 for good-qual­ity beans,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Nona hopes that more con­sumers will ap­pre­ci­ate lo­cally grown beans.</p>
    <p>“We of­fer trans­parency on where we source and the farmer’s ef­forts to grow ca­cao. Hope­fully with this cafe as a plat­form, more cus­tomers will ap­pre­ci­ate lo­cal prod­ucts and our ef­forts,” she said.</p>
