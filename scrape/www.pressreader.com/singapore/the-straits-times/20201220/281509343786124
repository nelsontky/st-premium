    <p>I thought I could get money with­out work­ing, while sat­is­fy­ing my sex­ual de­sires. It was a very com­fort­able and plea­sur­able life. I failed be­cause</p>
    <p>I was caught. I have no other feel­ings.</p>
    <p>TAKAHIRO SHI­RAISHI, who got rid of many of his fe­male vic­tims af­ter they were of no use to him – ei­ther be­cause they were poor and could not sup­port his life­style, or be­cause he feared that they would re­port his sex­ual as­sault.</p>
    <p>Takahiro Shi­raishi, the Ja­panese se­rial killer who was sen­tenced to death last week for mur­der­ing nine peo­ple and chop­ping up their bod­ies, craves ro­mance and hopes to get mar­ried.</p>
    <p>“I am think­ing it’d be good to have some­one who sup­ports me. She’d be able to come and see me here, and bring me things,” said the 30-year-old in an in­ter­view with Mainichi Shim­bun news­pa­per the morn­ing af­ter he was handed the sen­tence.</p>
    <p>“I want to meet a nor­mal girl (and) get mar­ried. If I do, she could see me even when I go to the Tokyo De­ten­tion House,” he added, re­fer­ring to the fa­cil­ity where death row in­mates are kept.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi has long preyed on hu­man weak­nesses, first as a sex scout bait­ing women into pros­ti­tu­tion and then an un­re­pen­tant killer who has not shown a tinge of re­morse for his deeds.</p>
    <p>He used Twit­ter to bait eight sui­ci­dal women to his 13.5 sq m home where he drugged, robbed, raped and killed them be­fore dis­mem­ber­ing their bod­ies in a three-month spree from Au­gust to Oc­to­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>He also killed a male friend of the first vic­tim who came too close to dis­cov­er­ing his crimes.</p>
    <p>Po­lice found nine hu­man heads and 240 bones stashed in cooler boxes on Hal­loween that year.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi had ini­tially craved love – how­ever per­verted or ab­nor­mal his def­i­ni­tion of ro­mance might be – when he be­gan suss­ing out his fe­male vic­tims.</p>
    <p>He was look­ing for a woman whom he could live with, and leech off with­out ever hav­ing to work.</p>
    <p>Tap­ping his ex­pe­ri­ence as a scout for the seedy sex trade in Shin­juku’s Kabu­ki­cho dis­trict – a role he had to give up af­ter he was caught and given a sus­pended sen­tence – he tar­geted vul­ner­a­ble women by whis­per­ing sweet noth­ings. He used two Twit­ter ac­counts. In one, he posed as a sui­cide guru with the han­dle “Hang­man”, skilled at help­ing peo­ple to end their lives.</p>
    <p>In the other, he por­trayed him­self as a for­lorn man hop­ing to find peo­ple with whom to en­ter into sui­cide pacts. He said: “I thought it would be eas­ier for peo­ple with some wor­ries or prob­lems to per­suade. It’s eas­ier to op­er­ate.”</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi’s mo­dus operandi for most cases was sim­i­lar, and he was pre­pared to play the long game.</p>
    <p>He won the trust of women by act­ing sym­pa­thetic to their plight, by which point he would toy with their feel­ings with sweet talk to reel them in.</p>
    <p>Whether or not he was se­ri­ous about the re­la­tion­ship, he dis­pensed of many of his fe­male vic­tims af­ter they lost their use to him – ei­ther be­cause they were poor and could not sup­port his life­style, or be­cause he feared that they would re­port his sex­ual as­sault.</p>
    <p>“I thought I could get money with­out work­ing, while sat­is­fy­ing my sex­ual de­sires,” Shi­raishi said.</p>
    <p>He robbed his vic­tims of any­where be­tween sev­eral hun­dred yen and tens of thou­sands of yen.</p>
    <p>While media out­lets once re­ported the names and pho­to­graphs of the vic­tims, there has since been a court gag or­der to keep their iden­ti­ties anony­mous.</p>
    <p>They were as­cribed the let­ters A to I, in chrono­log­i­cal or­der, dur­ing the hear­ings.</p>
    <p>“It was a very com­fort­able and plea­sur­able life,” Shi­raishi said in court. “I failed be­cause I was caught. I have no other feel­ings.”</p>
    <p>LOVE GONE SOUTH</p>
    <p>He thought he had met the love of his life in A, a 21-year-old com­pany em­ployee who once en­ter­tained sui­ci­dal thoughts af­ter her best friend killed her­self.</p>
    <p>But things went south af­ter she de­manded the re­turn of a loan, and jeal­ousy sur­faced when he sus­pected there was an­other man in the pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi found their heated ar­gu­ments “bother­some” and struck by at­tack­ing her from be­hind.</p>
    <p>Af­ter days went by with­out hav­ing been found out, he be­gan to think that he could get away with mur­der.</p>
    <p>The smooth op­er­a­tor tar­geted vul­ner­a­ble women, winning their trust with flat­tery like “I badly want to meet you”, even as he jug­gled mul­ti­ple women at the same time.</p>
    <p>One re­port­edly said in 2017 that she lucked out: “I had a date with Shi­raishi at his house, but he can­celled on me say­ing that he was meet­ing a friend.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing th­ese “meet­ings” at home, he fed the women al­co­hol and drugged them with sleep­ing pills or tran­quil­lis­ers be­fore rob­bing them. For eight of them, he also raped, killed and dis­mem­bered their bod­ies in his bath­room to de­stroy ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The male vic­tim was drugged and robbed be­fore he was killed and dis­mem­bered.</p>
    <p>“I dis­posed of their flesh and in­ter­nal or­gans like garbage, but kept their bones out of fear that I would be caught,” he told the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tors.</p>
    <p>One woman, now 24, was work­ing as a nurse in 2017 when she was ac­quainted with Shi­raishi. She told the Shukan Genkai weekly that she might have been the next vic­tim had he not been nabbed.</p>
    <p>They met on Twit­ter af­ter the woman said she was sui­ci­dal.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi in­tro­duced him­self as 25-year-old Ryo Ya­mamoto liv­ing in Tokyo’s Machida dis­trict.</p>
    <p>They ex­changed mes­sages for 52 days. “I love you,” he re­port­edly told her.</p>
    <p>They made plans to move in to­gether and hol­i­day at Na­gasaki’s Huis Ten Bosch theme park. But she also had a glimpse of his dark side, which she brushed off as a sick joke.</p>
    <p>She told the tabloid that he in­formed her that he had killed peo­ple, and sent her a pho­to­graph of a rope.</p>
    <p>“I had the im­pres­sion that he was a good man with a re­fresh­ing, trust­wor­thy voice,” she said. “But he was talk­ing to me even as he lived in a house sur­rounded by skulls and bones from carved-up bod­ies.”</p>
    <p>VI­CIOUS MUR­DERER</p>
    <p>Court tes­ti­monies by friends and rel­a­tives of the nine vic­tims tell a story of peo­ple who once en­ter­tained sui­ci­dal thoughts but had emerged from the dark­est pe­ri­ods of their life.</p>
    <p>Vic­tim A was ap­ply­ing for new jobs. Her friend C – the only male vic­tim – was pas­sion­ate about mu­sic and wanted to be­come a full­time mu­si­cian, though a ma­jor ill­ness once left him hos­pi­talised and briefly robbed him of his will to live.</p>
    <p>Vic­tim B, 15, had a change of heart but felt pres­sured into meet­ing Shi­raishi due to their age dif­fer­ence of more than 10 years.</p>
    <p>Vic­tim D, 19, had bought a ki­mono to wear on Com­ing-of-Age Day, a ma­jor cel­e­bra­tion in Ja­pan to mark adult­hood for those turn­ing 20.</p>
    <p>Vic­tim E, 26, was a di­vorcee with a daugh­ter who is now nine years old. Her ex-hus­band said: “She show­ered our child with so much love. She was not rich, but would al­ways pri­ori­tise our girl when she bought food and clothes.”</p>
    <p>He has not told their daugh­ter that her mother is dead, and wished that they could have put aside their dif­fer­ences and “live to­gether again as a fam­ily of three”.</p>
    <p>Vic­tim F, 17, had dreams of work­ing as a nurse.</p>
    <p>Vic­tim G, 17, was work­ing part­time at a gy­oza (dumpling) shop and promised her fa­ther they would make the food to­gether.</p>
    <p>Vic­tim H, 25, was a social recluse who emerged from her shell, and was work­ing part-time in a con­ve­nience store. She told her fam­ily she hoped to marry and have her own fam­ily and was sav­ing up for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Vic­tim I, 23, was de­pressed when her mother died in June 2017, but was com­ing out of the dark pe­riod with the sup­port of her brother.</p>
    <p>He even­tu­ally raised the alarm con­cern­ing Shi­raishi’s crimes, af­ter he hacked into his sis­ter’s Twit­ter ac­count and read the mes­sages.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi’s defence team ar­gued that there was “tacit agree­ment” be­hind the “con­sen­sual mur­ders”, given that they told him that they wanted to die.</p>
    <p>But the pros­e­cu­tion said there was ob­vi­ously no con­sent given, and that he had struck when the vic­tims were un­aware.</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi was vis­i­bly shaken dur­ing the trial when a mes­sage from his mother was read out in court. “I’ve been ask­ing my­self if I could even live, think­ing of the vic­tims and their be­reaved fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>He told the pros­e­cu­tion that he would “kill the per­pe­tra­tors” when asked to imag­ine that his mother and sis­ter were stran­gled, sex­u­ally as­saulted and killed.</p>
    <p>Through­out the trial, he de­fied his own lawyers by re­fus­ing to an­swer their ques­tions, hop­ing to end the process faster so as not to “in­con­ve­nience his rel­a­tives”.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing his fam­ily, he said: “I don’t think it’s pos­si­ble, but I want you to for­get about my ex­is­tence and live on.”</p>
    <p>Shi­raishi’s lawyers ap­pealed against the death sen­tence on Fri­day, likely against their client’s wishes, which means the ap­peal could yet be with­drawn.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, death row in­mates get no prior no­tice of their im­pend­ing ex­e­cu­tion un­til the very morn­ing they face the gal­lows.</p>
    <p>“I want to use the time I have left to find a girl,” Shi­raishi told the Mainichi daily.</p>
    <p>“I want to l ook for some­one who’ll marry me while I’m i n prison. Sev­eral peo­ple have come in the last two years but noth­ing has led to mar­riage.”</p>
