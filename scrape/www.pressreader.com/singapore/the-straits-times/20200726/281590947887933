    <p>Six key mem­bers of the fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship team will take on new port­fo­lios in a move that will ex­pose younger of­fice-hold­ers to new min­istries and widen their ex­pe­ri­ence, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, an­nounc­ing the new Cabi­net line-up yes­ter­day, said Mr Lawrence Wong, 47, will be the new Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing Mr Wong’s place as Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter is Mr Des­mond Lee, 44, who will give up his role as Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Ye Kung, 50, will re­lin­quish the Ed­u­ca­tion port­fo­lio to be­come Trans­port Min­is­ter, a role pre­vi­ously held by Mr Khaw Boon Wan, who has re­tired.</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Fu, 56, will helm the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment – a new ver­sion of what used to be the Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources (MEWR). The min­istry’s new name will bet­ter re­flect its fu­ture role in safe­guard­ing sus­tain­abil­ity as part of the na­tional agenda, said PM Lee, 68.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, 57, will leave MEWR to helm the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment. He will also take up the post of Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Health and con­tinue to be Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing his think­ing be­hind the ro­ta­tion of the 4G min­is­ters in Cabi­net in re­sponse to a ques­tion from the me­dia, PM Lee said pro­vid­ing con­ti­nu­ity, giv­ing min­is­ters ex­po­sure and re­newal are three fac­tors be­hind the Cabi­net reshuf­fle.</p>
    <p>The grave sit­u­a­tion posed by Covid-19 puts a pre­mium on ex­pe­ri­ence and a sure touch, said PM Lee, who was speak­ing from the Is­tana at a press con­fer­ence live-streamed on Face­book yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is why most Cabi­net min­is­ters are ex­pe­ri­enced, with at least one term of gov­ern­ment as po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers. It is also why most of the older min­is­ters are stay­ing on, he added. At the same time, the younger min­is­ters are be­ing ro­tated to gain ex­po­sure and ex­pe­ri­ence, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“We reg­u­larly do this dur­ing Cabi­net shuf­fles, and the in­tent is to ex­pose the of­fice-hold­ers to dif­fer­ent port­fo­lios to gain both breadth and depth, to un­der­stand the in­tri­ca­cies of the is­sues, and to see things from dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee added that most of the younger min­is­ters came in one or two terms ago, and their ex­po­sure in gov­ern­ment is not as com­pre­hen­sive or long, com­pared with the ex­pe­ri­ence of 3G min­is­ters such as se­nior min­is­ters Teo Chee Hean and Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, and De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen.</p>
    <p>He said: “There­fore, it’s valu­able for them to have to be put in dif­fer­ent and con­trast­ing places in or­der to un­der­stand is­sues from dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives, and there­fore, be able to come to a con­sid­ered judg­ment col­lec­tively on what should be the na­tional per­spec­tive to take when you make de­ci­sions in Cabi­net, and not just be speak­ing on be­half of the seat which you’re sit­ting upon at that time.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause to­mor­row, you may be in a dif­fer­ent seat, and you must make up your mind what is the best thing to do for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat will take on an ad­di­tional role as Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said Mr Heng has been do­ing the job since the last term of gov­ern­ment, chair­ing both the Fu­ture Econ­omy Coun­cil and Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion, so the new ti­tle “just for­malises ex­ist­ing ar­range­ments”.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, 59, will con­tinue to over­see the Strat­egy Group within the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice that co­or­di­nates na­tional poli­cies and plans across the Gov­ern­ment, PM</p>
    <p>Lee said.</p>
    <p>At the Cabi­net reshuf­fle that fol­lowed GE2011, 11 out of 14 min­istries had a change in min­is­ter, while this time, there are six out of 15 min­istries with new lead­ers.</p>
