    <p>TOLEDO (Ohio) • The ma­jor­ity of South Korea’s top women’s golfers, in­clud­ing world No. 1 Ko Jin-young and third-ranked Park Sung-hyun, are not at the Drive On Cham­pi­onship, the LPGA Tour’s first event in more than five months, be­cause of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They have opted to stay home and play on the Korean LPGA Tour in­stead, and are re­port­edly set to miss the first Ma­jor of the year, the Aug 20-23 Women’s Bri­tish Open in Scot­land.</p>
    <p>Their ab­sence, how­ever, is giv­ing oth­ers the op­por­tu­nity to shine, like Danielle Kang. The world No. 4 fired a flaw­less, six-un­der round of 66, in­clud­ing six birdies, to move one stroke ahead of Eng­land’s Jodi Ewart Shad­off in the open­ing round on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>There will be only two more events before the Women’s Bri­tish Open starts, so the Amer­i­can is keen to get as much com­pet­i­tive golf after not work­ing with her cad­die for six months.</p>
    <p>The 2017 Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner said: “I would say I just didn’t have any hic­cups on any part of the game.</p>
    <p>“I def­i­nitely mishit some shots, mishit some putts, but I had some great iron shots, great tee shots, and great putts and chips.</p>
    <p>“So any time one part of my game kind of gave me a tough shot, I made it up with a good save.”</p>
    <p>The 54-hole tour­na­ment at the In­ver­ness Club is tak­ing place with­out spec­ta­tors, a novelty that Kang is still get­ting used to.</p>
    <p>“I would def­i­nitely think it’s calmer, more level-headed. Maybe that’s good for me,” she said. “But I also re­ally like the fans. To­day was very mel­low.”</p>
    <p>A crowded leader­board lurks just be­hind Kang and Ewart Shad­off. France’s Ce­line Boutier is tied for third with South African LeeAnne Pace after both carded 68s.</p>
    <p>Ly­dia Ko of New Zealand, Aus­tralian Min­jee Lee and Amer­i­can Amy Ol­son share fifth spot on 69.</p>
    <p>With her last event in Fe­bru­ary, for­mer world No. 1 Ko ad­mit­ted that she was sim­ply re­lieved to be play­ing again.</p>
    <p>“I saw some of the girls and I was like, ‘Man, it’s nice to not see you through a vir­tual app or just on so­cial me­dia’,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to just be able to see them.”</p>
