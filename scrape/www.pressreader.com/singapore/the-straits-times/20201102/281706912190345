    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Aus­tralia recorded no new daily coron­avirus com­mu­nity in­fec­tions yes­ter­day for the first time in nearly five months, health of­fi­cials said, paving the way for fur­ther eas­ing of so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The state of Vic­to­ria, a coron­avirus hot spot which ac­counts for more than 90 per cent of Aus­tralia’s 907 coron­avirus-re­lated deaths, saw zero new daily in­fec­tions and no deaths for the se­cond con­sec­u­tive day.</p>
    <p>With no fresh cases of Covid-19 recorded in the rest of the coun­try, Aus­tralia saw its first day of no trans­mis­sions since June 9, Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt said.</p>
    <p>“Thank you to all of our amaz­ing health and public health work­ers and above all else the Aus­tralian peo­ple,” Mr Hunt said on his Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>The mile­stone comes as state gov­ern­ments ease do­mes­tic travel re­stric­tions and as Mel­bourne, the na­tion’s se­cond-largest city, emerges from a three­month l ock­down that shut­tered busi­nesses and largely con­fined res­i­dents to their homes.</p>
    <p>The state of West­ern Aus­tralia, which shut its bor­ders to the rest of the na­tion start­ing in March, has an­nounced it in­tends to start al­low­ing trav­ellers to en­ter from Nov 14.</p>
    <p>Queens­land will re­open its bor­der to re­gional vis­i­tors from New South Wales be­gin­ning to­mor­row, though res­i­dents of Aus­tralia’s largest city Syd­ney, and those from the state of Vic­to­ria, will not be al­lowed to en­ter for now.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia is on track to reach Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son’s goal of a coun­try with­out do­mes­tic bor­der re­stric­tions by Christ­mas, Mr Hunt said yes­ter­day, as re­ported by The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald.</p>
    <p>Swift and strin­gent mea­sures, com­bined with com­mu­nity com­pli­ance, have been cred­ited for rein­ing in the pan­demic be­fore it strained the public health sys­tem in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Queens­land vot­ers on Satur­day elected the in­cum­bent La­bor Party for a third term, show­ing sup­port for keep­ing the state’s in­ter­nal bor­ders closed – which has put the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties at odds with the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria last week ended most of its 111-day lock­down re­stric­tions – some of the world’s tough­est and long­est – with a re­cent Ip­sos poll com­mis­sioned by The Age news­pa­per and Nine News show­ing Vic­to­ri­ans backed the state’s han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria chief health of­fi­cer Brett Sut­ton hinted yes­ter­day that the state may see more of its public move­ment re­stric­tions eased in the com­ing days, but urged fur­ther com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>“What al­lowances come... will ab­so­lutely be in­formed by what this week looks like,” Pro­fes­sor Sut­ton said at a tele­vised press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“To see 50,000 cases a day in France, to see Bel­gium send­ing pa­tients out­side the coun­try be­cause they’re so over­whelmed – that’s what we might have faced if we hadn’t been able to get on top of it.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has re­ported just over 27,500 cases since the pan­demic started due to the coun­try quickly clos­ing its in­ter­na­tional bor­ders and im­pos­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs as well as wide­spread test­ing and trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Aus­tralia warned its ci­ti­zens not to travel to the United States, its key ally, due to the risk of protest vi­o­lence and the coron­avirus.</p>
