    <p>A seem­ingly end­less queue of cars inched along a free­way in east­ern Mel­bourne yes­ter­day, as traf­fic he­li­copters cap­tured the scene from above. Shop­pers were flock­ing to the an­nual Novem­ber sales at Chad­stone mall, Aus­tralia’s largest shop­ping cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The scene was markedly dif­fer­ent from weeks ago, when the city cen­tre was mostly shut as Mel­bourne en­dured one of the world’s strictest Covid-19 lock­downs fol­low­ing an out­break that in­cluded a clus­ter of cases linked to a butcher’s at the mall.</p>
    <p>But those days of cur­fews and re­tail clo­sures now seem a dis­tant mem­ory. In Mel­bourne, and across Aus­tralia, the pan­demic has largely been brought un­der con­trol – and life is re­turn­ing to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants and pubs are full. The sum­mer cricket sea­son started yes­ter­day, with a so­cially-dis­tanced crowd of 20,000 at­tend­ing a match be­tween India and Aus­tralia in Syd­ney. From this week, res­i­dents in Mel­bourne, Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-largest city, are no longer re­quired to wear masks out­doors, while the state of New South Wales be­gan al­low­ing up to 3,000 peo­ple to gather at out­door events.</p>
    <p>At a shop­ping cen­tre in Syd­ney, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Re­tail Ap­parel Group Gary No­vis de­scribed yes­ter­day as “un­be­liev­able”.</p>
    <p>“It’s the busiest I’ve seen it all year,” he told The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald. “We wouldn’t have thought six months ago that we’d be here now.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia recorded seven new cases of Covid-19, all of them in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers in quar­an­tine. Aside from the state of South Aus­tralia, which is grad­u­ally over­com­ing a small out­break, no state or ter­ri­tory in Aus­tralia has recorded a new lo­cal case in more than two weeks.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic be­gan, gov­ern­ments in Aus­tralia have en­forced strict lock­downs, so­cial distancing rules and bor­der clo­sures. In to­tal, Aus­tralia has recorded 27,872 cases and 907 deaths.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cantly, the state of Vic­to­ria – which reg­is­tered 73 per cent of all Covid-19 cases in Aus­tralia – marked 28 days with­out any com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion yes­ter­day, which ef­fec­tively means it has elim­i­nated the virus.</p>
    <p>Wel­com­ing the news, Vic­to­ria’s gov­ern­ment said it had “achieved some­thing pre­cious”, with its rare sup­pres­sion of a large-scale out­break likened to sim­i­lar suc­cesses in China and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“To­day is a big day, a mile­stone day in what has been a re­ally chal­leng­ing year,” said state Trans­port In­fra­struc­ture Min­is­ter Jac­inta Al­lan. “We can all feel re­ally pleased and proud of the ef­fort that each and ev­ery Vic­to­rian has made.”</p>
    <p>But she added: “The pan­demic is not over, there is still a way to go, we still have to wait and see the im­pacts a vac­cine brings.”</p>
    <p>Across Aus­tralia, in­ter­nal bor­ders are be­ing opened – with trav­ellers from Syd­ney and the state of Vic­to­ria to be al­lowed to re­turn to Queens­land – a pop­u­lar hol­i­day des­ti­na­tion – from next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Flights are re­sum­ing be­tween Syd­ney and Mel­bourne, pre­vi­ously one of the world’s busiest routes but at a stand­still for four months due to Mel­bourne’s out­break.</p>
    <p>There is now talk about eas­ing strict in­ter­na­tional travel curbs.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is also show­ing promis­ing signs of re­bound. Last month, there was a rise in both the num­ber of new jobs and the num­ber of hours worked.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son this week told re­porters: “Aus­tralia is in a hand­ful of coun­tries that stand out not just for how we’ve sup­pressed the virus, but how we have mit­i­gated the eco­nomic im­pact on Aus­tralia.”</p>
