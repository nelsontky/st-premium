    <p>The In­dian state of Ut­tar Pradesh yes­ter­day cut off ac­cess to a vil­lage where a teenager died af­ter be­ing al­legedly gang-raped, and im­posed a ban on gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple, amid grow­ing na­tional outrage over the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The Ut­tar Pradesh govern­ment, which last week an­nounced a plan to name and shame sex­ual of­fend­ers to curb crimes, yes­ter­day cut off ac­cess to a vil­lage where a teenager was al­legedly gang raped, and im­posed a ban on gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple amid grow­ing na­tional outrage.</p>
    <p>The move was in­ter­preted by the op­po­si­tion as a means to stop Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and his sis­ter Priyanka from vis­it­ing the vic­tim’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old wo­man from the down­trod­den Dalit caste died on Tues­day, two weeks af­ter she was said to have been gang raped in the Hathras district of the state.</p>
    <p>She was found bleed­ing and paral­ysed by her fam­ily on Sept 14 in fields near her home. Four up­per­caste men have been ar­rested in the case, with anger grow­ing only af­ter the po­lice forcibly car­ried out a cre­ma­tion without the fam­ily present.</p>
    <p>Amid mount­ing crit­i­cism, Ut­tar Pradesh chief min­is­ter Yogi Adityanath tweeted that Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi had sought “strictest ac­tion” against the at­tack­ers a day be­fore cut­ting off ac­cess to the vil­lage, ex­cept for the me­dia.</p>
    <p>The Gandhi sib­lings were pre­vented from go­ing to the vil­lage and held as they were try­ing to ad­vance on foot af­ter their ve­hi­cle was stopped by po­lice on a high­way link­ing Delhi and Ut­tar Pradesh.</p>
    <p>Mr Gandhi said he was phys­i­cally pushed to the ground by the po­lice. The duo were taken back to Delhi.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing in a sec­ond case in­volv­ing a 22-year-old wo­man, also from the Dalit caste, who died on Tues­day, af­ter she was al­legedly gang raped.</p>
    <p>Sex­ual crimes against women re­main a real area of con­cern for In­dia, which is strug­gling to pro­vide a safe en­vi­ron­ment for young girls and women.</p>
    <p>In­dia recorded 405,861 cases of crime against women last year, up 7.3 per cent over 2018, ac­cord­ing to lat­est data re­leased on Tues­day by the Na­tional Crime Record Bureau.</p>
    <p>Ut­tar Pradesh, which is the most pop­u­lous state in In­dia, reg­is­tered the high­est num­ber of crimes against women, in­clud­ing chil­dren, with 59,853 cases.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have said the name and shame ac­tion would “in­stil con­fi­dence” among women.</p>
    <p>The plan is to put up posters, which in­clude pic­tures of sex­ual of­fend­ers and those out on bail, at street cross­ings and other prom­i­nent places. Lo­cal women po­lice will iden­tify the of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>“Their par­ents will be con­tacted... so that they don’t re­peat the of­fence,” said ad­di­tional chief sec­re­tary Av­inash Ku­mar Awasthi.</p>
    <p>Women’s rights ac­tivists main­tained it would have lit­tle im­pact and said the govern­ment needed to take stronger mea­sures to curb crimes against women.</p>
    <p>“Posters don’t scare peo­ple,” said Dr Ran­jana Ku­mari, di­rec­tor of the New Delhi-based Cen­tre for So­cial Re­search. “What needs to be done is that the po­lice must act as en­forcers. You have to do away with im­punity by giv­ing the mes­sage it (sex­ual crimes) will not be tol­er­ated. That you will be caught and pun­ished. And it is im­por­tant to cre</p>
    <p>ate gen­der sen­si­ti­sa­tion pro­grammes for the young in school.”</p>
    <p>Across In­dia, vic­tims and their fam­i­lies of­ten hes­i­tate to ap­proach the po­lice and courts for fear of reprisal and stigma. Court cases can also take years, with the prob­lem ex­ac­er­bated by poor in­ves­ti­ga­tion and low con­vic­tion rates.</p>
    <p>Sex­ual crimes came into sharp fo­cus af­ter the fa­tal gang rape of a phys­io­ther­apy stu­dent on a bus in Delhi i n 2012. Mas­sive street protests fol­low­ing the crime forced the govern­ment to change laws, in­clud­ing in­tro­duc­ing the death penalty for se­rial rapists. Four men con­victed of the crime were hanged in March this year.</p>
    <p>But ac­tivists said lit­tle has changed for women’s safety de­spite the spo­radic fo­cus on crimes against them.</p>
