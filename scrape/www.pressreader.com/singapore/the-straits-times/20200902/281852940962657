    <p>TOKYO • The trade min­is­ters of Ja­pan, In­dia and Aus­tralia have agreed to work to­wards achiev­ing sup­ply chain re­silience in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, fol­low­ing re­ports that the three coun­tries are look­ing to work to­gether to counter China’s dom­i­nance in trade.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters in­structed their of­fi­cials to promptly ham­mer out de­tails for an ini­tia­tive to strengthen sup­ply chains for launch later this year, ac­cord­ing to a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Mr Hiroshi Ka­jiyama, Aus­tralia’s Mr Si­mon Birm­ing­ham and In­dia’s Mr Piyush Goyal at­tended the video con­fer­ence yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>They also called on other coun­tries in the re­gion with shared views to take part in the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>The three coun­tries are seek­ing to build stronger sup­ply chains to counter China’s dom­i­nance as trade and geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions escalate across the re­gion, Bloomberg re­ported last month, cit­ing peo­ple in Tokyo and New Delhi with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>While China was not specif­i­cally ad­dressed dur­ing yes­ter­day’s meet­ing, the three min­is­ters did agree that Asean na­tions would be good can­di­dates to reach out to next, ac­cord­ing to Ja­pan’s trade min­istry.</p>
    <p>The con­fer­ence was hosted by Ja­pan. The three min­is­ters may meet again as needed while of­fi­cials work to­wards putting the ini­tia­tive to­gether by the end of the year, the Ja­panese min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the con­fer­ence, Mr Ka­jiyama sug­gested in­clud­ing the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of trade pro­ce­dures and sup­port for cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture as part of the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>A pre-ex­ist­ing scheme where Ja­pan is sup­port­ing capex (cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture) in Asean coun­tries will serve as one ref­er­ence point for the ini­tia­tive, ac­cord­ing to the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Asean is likely to see an ac­cel­er­a­tion in sup­ply chain shifts in the com­ing year, an­a­lysts have said.</p>
    <p>Along with the United States, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia make up the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue, or Quad, a loose group­ing for na­tional se­cu­rity con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>A se­nior US diplo­mat said on Mon­day that Wash­ing­ton would like to start for­mal­is­ing the Quad as the base for a broader se­cu­rity al­liance in the re­gion and min­is­ters of the group in­tend to hold an in-per­son meet­ing in New Delhi this au­tumn.</p>
