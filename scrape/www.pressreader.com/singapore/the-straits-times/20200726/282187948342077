    <p>If you were won­der­ing how fa­mous fam­ily The Beck­hams were keep­ing ac­tive and healthy un­der lock­down, you need look no fur­ther than pa­tri­arch David Beck­ham’s In­sta­gram feed.</p>
    <p>His lat­est pur­suit? Bee­keep­ing and tend­ing to a home­made hive. The global foot­ball icon has taken up the un­usual new hobby while shel­ter­ing in the Cotswolds in Eng­land with his fash­ion de­signer wife Vic­to­ria and three of their four chil­dren – Harper, nine, Cruz, 15, and Romeo, 17.</p>
    <p>The 45-year-old says that spend­ing time as a fam­ily in one place and try­ing new things such as bak­ing and gar­den­ing has been “one of the pos­i­tives of the lock­down”.</p>
    <p>“I like to be busy, so I built the hive from a kit I bought on­line and then had my first de­liv­ery of bees about a month ago, and all the kids got in­volved with set­ting them up,” says AIA global am­bas­sador Beck­ham in an e-mail in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times, ahead of his ap­pear­ance on AIA Live.</p>
    <p>The day-long on­line health and well­ness-cen­tric event will be livestream­ed on YouTube on Aug 2.</p>
    <p>Along with AIA ambassador­s from across the globe, he will be shar­ing his thoughts and ex­pe­ri­ences about how peo­ple can live health­ier, longer and bet­ter lives.</p>
    <p>Through­out the event, view­ers will be able to pick up ideas, tips and skills – such as how to drib­ble like a pro­fes­sional foot­ball player from Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur coaches; sim­ple breath­ing tech­niques that they can use daily to man­age stress and anx­i­ety; and healthy recipes for ra­men, pro­tein balls and oat con­gee from Bri­tish chef Jeremy Pang in a cook-along ses­sion with Sin­ga­porean ac­tor and host Andie Chen.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter known for his abil­ity to curl free kicks into the cor­ner of the net at the height of his foot­ball ca­reer, Beck­ham has, of late, been fi­ness­ing his skills for his new hob­bies, par­tic­u­larly bak­ing.</p>
    <p>“My bak­ing has also im­proved dur­ing lock­down and lemon driz­zle cake is my per­sonal favourite – not sure I’m ready for (The Great Bri­tish) Bake Off yet, but the cakes don’t sink in the mid­dle any­more,” he quips.</p>
    <p>De­spite the cakes, he is still con­scious of main­tain­ing bal­ance, say­ing: “I love food, so if I want to en­joy food, then I need to bal­ance it out and keep fit by ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly.”</p>
    <p>Then there is the gar­den­ing, another new hobby.</p>
    <p>“I’ve en­joyed gar­den­ing and Harper has been help­ing me with plant­ing seeds, so I’d like to keep up with that even as lock­down lifts,” he says. “It’s been nice dis­cov­er­ing some­thing to­gether and spend­ing time chat­ting as we were plant­ing.”</p>
    <p>Lock­down or oth­er­wise, he says he has “al­ways been one for rou­tines”.</p>
    <p>He cred­its both his sport­ing ca­reer and his par­ents for this, adding that “habits formed in early child­hood stay with you for­ever, so it’s al­ways been some­thing I fo­cused on with my fam­ily”.</p>
    <p>“I’m lucky that for my ca­reer, I’ve al­ways had to look af­ter my­self, so I learnt good habits from a young age... I’ve been for­tu­nate that I was en­cour­aged by my par­ents to eat well and I’ve tried to in­stil this in my kids,” says the foot­ball great, who made his first team de­but with Manch­ester United in 1992 when he was just 17.</p>
    <p>But be­yond phys­i­cal fit­ness, he notes that “we’ve all faced un­ex­pected chal­lenges this year and look­ing af­ter our­selves, men­tally and phys­i­cally, has never been more im­por­tant”.</p>
    <p>He feels that it is about “mak­ing lit­tle changes in your life that can make a big dif­fer­ence”.</p>
    <p>It is a phi­los­o­phy that ex­tends to his more re­cent role as pres­i­dent and part owner of Ma­jor League Soc­cer team In­ter Mi­ami CF (IMCF).</p>
    <p>Re­cently, he spent time with Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur coach Jose Mour­inho, staff and play­ers to ex­plore their new train­ing fa­cil­ity and hear how they deal with all as­pects of the game – from nu­tri­tion to sleep to han­dling pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The re­tired foot­baller, who is no stranger to pub­lic scru­tiny of his per­sonal life, is also con­scious of mod­ern-day pres­sures on his play­ers, ac­knowl­edg­ing that “foot­ball has changed a lot since I first started play­ing”.</p>
    <p>“Young play­ers face a lot of at­ten­tion nowa­days, es­pe­cially with things like so­cial me­dia, so as a team owner, I am com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing my play­ers know that when they are feel­ing men­tal pres­sure, this is okay and they can talk about any con­cerns with the IMCF staff,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant for young play­ers to feel able to talk to their fam­ily, friends and club so they can look af­ter their men­tal well­ness as well as phys­i­cal fit­ness.”</p>
    <p>My bak­ing has... im­proved dur­ing lock­down and lemon driz­zle cake is my per­sonal favourite – not sure I’m ready for (The Great Bri­tish) Bake Off yet, but the cakes don’t sink in the mid­dle any­more. ’’</p>
