    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19) There is plenty of drama un­der the sur­face and you al­most cer­tainly have to do some de­tec­tive work to fig­ure it all out.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) Your feel­ings are get­ting deeper, so make sure you give your­self time to process them. It can be a good day, even if you are in a dark mood.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20) It is time to fo­cus on other peo­ple – al­most to the ex­clu­sion of your own needs. That does not mean you do not have to eat or stay hy­drated.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22) You are feel­ing torn between a few op­tions, none of which seems to be right for you. Take your time and fig­ure out what is best.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22) You can tell there is more go­ing on with your friends than meets the eye – but it takes some dig­ging to get to the truth.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22) Things are afoot that you do not fully un­der­stand – but you should still be able to get a clue or two if you dig deeper.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22) Your busi­ness needs are heavy on your mind – so make sure you are pay­ing at­ten­tion to them. It may be a good time to ask for ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21) It is a good day for heal­ing and you should find that some­thing you had thought would never come back to you is still alive and kick­ing.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Your dream life is a bit more in­ter­est­ing than re­al­ity – at least for now. It may be a good time to take notes.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Ask your­self one big ques­tion – but do not ex­pect fast or easy an­swers. You need to wres­tle with it for as long as it takes.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) Job-re­lated con­cerns are trou­bling you, but that just means it is time to re­dou­ble your ef­forts to get some­thing new.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20) Your in­stincts need to be heard – so give them veto power over all your de­ci­sions. Say no to some­thing that sounds too good to be true.</p>
