    <p>A for­mer gen­eral man­ager of Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil (AMKTC), who is serv­ing 27 months in jail for cor­rup­tion, will have to spend a longer time in prison af­ter his sen­tence was raised to three years and three months yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon al­lowed an ap­peal by the pros­e­cu­tion to in­crease the sen­tence meted out to Wong Chee Meng, 59, who re­ceived more than $86,000 in a stream of bribes from Chia Sin Lan, 64, be­tween 2014 and 2016.</p>
    <p>Chia is the di­rec­tor of two com­pa­nies – 19-ANC En­ter­prise and 19-NS2 En­ter­prise – which car­ried out works for town coun­cils. His orig­i­nal sen­tence of 21 months’ jail was also in­creased yes­ter­day, to two years and nine months.</p>
    <p>CJ Menon said Chia de­rived sub­stan­tial ben­e­fits from his cul­ti­va­tion of Wong. As an in­sider, Wong was able to in­ter­vene in the award of ten­ders to ad­vance the in­ter­ests of</p>
    <p>Chia’s com­pa­nies, he said.</p>
    <p>Wong had abused his po­si­tion and the high degree of trust re­posed in him to com­mit the of­fences, said CJ Menon. He did not con­sider the pub­lic dis­quiet caused by the of­fences to be an ag­gra­vat­ing fac­tor.</p>
    <p>“While the of­fences were un­doubt­edly se­ri­ous, in­volv­ing one of the most se­nior non-po­lit­i­cal em­ploy­ees in a town coun­cil... the ev­i­dence also showed that the scope of the cor­rup­tion was iso­lated to just Wong.”</p>
    <p>Both sides had ap­pealed against the orig­i­nal jail terms meted out by a district judge in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>In May, pros­e­cu­tors ar­gued for four years’ jail for Wong, and three years and eight months’ jail for Chia. The lawyers for Wong sought be­tween 11 and 14 months’ jail, while Chia’s sought 17 months’ jail.</p>
    <p>Wong was AMKTC’s gen­eral man­ager from 2013 to 2016. He was re­moved from duty af­ter the town coun­cil re­ceived a com­plaint about the way he han­dled con­tracts.</p>
    <p>In March last year, Wong and Chia each pleaded guilty to three cor­rup­tion charges part-way through a trial that started in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>The first charge was over a $13,500 dis­count on a Toy­ota Corolla Altis owned by 19-ANC that was sold to Wong in 2014. The sec­ond charge was over $34,000 in ex­penses in­curred at KTV lounges and mas­sage spas. The third charge was over pay­ments to Wong’s mis­tress to­talling about $27,800.</p>
    <p>Two other charges over bribes amount­ing to nearly $10,800 were taken into considerat­ion.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment, CJ Menon also set out a sen­tenc­ing frame­work for cor­rupt trans­ac­tions re­lat­ing to con­tracts with the Gov­ern­ment or pub­lic bod­ies. Un­der the law, such of­fences carry a max­i­mum pun­ish­ment of up to seven years’ jail and a fine of up to $100,000.</p>
    <p>He laid out a sen­tenc­ing ma­trix to de­ter­mine the start­ing point for sen­tences based on the level of harm caused and the of­fender’s cul­pa­bil­ity. The sen­tence is then ad­justed to ac­count for fac­tors spe­cific to each of­fender.</p>
    <p>CJ Menon de­clined to grant the pros­e­cu­tion’s ap­pli­ca­tion for an or­der to en­force the pay­ment of a $23,398.09 penalty im­posed on Wong. He said Wong had al­ready been or­dered to serve one month’s jail in de­fault of pay­ment.</p>
