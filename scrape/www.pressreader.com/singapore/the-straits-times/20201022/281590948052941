    <p>Em­bat­tled Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha said yes­ter­day that he was pre­pared to re­peal the state of se­ri­ous emer­gency de­clared in Bangkok to lower po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­tures but asked pro­test­ers who have been mass­ing daily on the streets to work through Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Em­bat­tled Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha said yes­ter­day that he was pre­pared to re­peal the state of se­ri­ous emer­gency de­clared in Bangkok to lower po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­tures, but asked pro­test­ers who have been mass­ing daily on the streets to work through Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He made the com­ments in a pre­re­corded ad­dress tele­vised yes­ter­day evening as thou­sands of antigov­ern­ment pro­test­ers marched to Gov­ern­ment House, where po­lice re­in­force­ments stood guard.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tions – led largely by youth who de­mand that the Con­sti­tu­tion be amended, Mr Prayut re­sign and the monar­chy be re­formed – have been tak­ing place daily over the past week af­ter the gov­ern­ment banned pub­lic gath­er­ings of five or more peo­ple and granted se­cu­rity of­fi­cers broad pow­ers to search and de­tain in­di­vid­u­als in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Anger over wa­ter can­non de­ployed by po­lice last Fri­day prompted more peo­ple to take to the streets, as flash mobs were or­gan­ised via so­cial me­dia chan­nels that the gov­ern­ment has re­port­edly tried to shut down.</p>
    <p>The protests have largely been peace­ful, in­volv­ing youth gath­er­ing at short no­tice, mak­ing speeches con­demn­ing the gov­ern­ment and do­ing a three-fin­ger salute against dic­ta­tor­ship. Ar­rests of dozens of key lead­ers have sim­ply spurred more – and even younger – sup­port­ers to pick up the slack.</p>
    <p>“I am cur­rently pre­par­ing to lift the state of se­vere emer­gency in Bangkok and will do so promptly if there are no vi­o­lent in­ci­dents,” said Mr Prayut.</p>
    <p>“The pro­test­ers have made their voices and views heard. It is now time for them to let their views be rec­on­ciled with the views of other seg­ments of Thai so­ci­ety through their rep­re­sen­ta­tives in Par­lia­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut, a for­mer coup leader, added: “I am ap­peal­ing to all sides that we must heal in­juries now be­fore they be­come too deep.”</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen if pro­test­ers will heed his call. Protest leader Tat­tep Ruang­pra­paik­it­seree, 23, told Reuters: “Prayut must re­sign first and that is the eas­i­est thing to do.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a no­tice up­loaded to the Royal Gazette web­site de­clared that an ex­tra­or­di­nary par­lia­men­tary sit­ting would be con­vened from Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The young pro­test­ers have been par­tic­u­larly vo­cal about the need to bring the pow­ers of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn in line with his of­fi­cial sta­tus as a con­sti­tu­tional monarch.</p>
    <p>The King, who is ar­guably the rich­est monarch in the world with es­ti­mated as­sets of over US$40 bil­lion (S$54 bil­lion), di­rectly con­trols two army units.</p>
    <p>But the calls have been met with hos­til­ity from roy­al­ist groups, one of which briefly scuf­fled with antigov­ern­ment pro­test­ers at Ramkhamhae­ng Uni­ver­sity yes­ter­day af­ter­noon. Po­lice even­tu­ally kept the two sides apart.</p>
    <p>There are con­cerns that this brew­ing con­flict could spi­ral out of con­trol and sink an econ­omy that is ex­pected to con­tract by more than 7 per cent this year be­cause of the global cri­sis caused by the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, roy­al­ists gath­ered in Bangkok as well as prov­inces like Lam­pang and Narathi­wat, hold­ing por­traits of King Va­ji­ra­longkorn as well as his revered late fa­ther, King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej, to show sup­port for the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut said: “We must now step back from the edge of the slip­pery slope that can eas­ily slide to chaos, where all sides lose con­trol of the sit­u­a­tion, where emo­tions take over our bet­ter judg­ment, vi­o­lence begets more vi­o­lence, and, as his­tory has shown us all many times, we can end in a sit­u­a­tion where the en­tire coun­try suf­fers.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, in an ap­par­ent ref­er­ence to the monar­chy, he said: “A very im­por­tant part of what makes ev­ery Thai a Thai is our in­sti­tu­tions – rooted in our cul­ture and in cen­turies of tra­di­tion and val­ues. When we dam­age our her­itage, we also lose a very im­por­tant part of what makes us all Thai.”</p>
