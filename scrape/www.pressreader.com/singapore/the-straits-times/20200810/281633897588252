    <p>Scat­tered across the is­land, Sin­ga­pore­ans gath­ered in pock­ets of joy de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic to cel­e­brate their 55th Na­tional Day, their first so­cially dis­tanced one.</p>
    <p>The re­duced fes­tiv­i­ties meant the spec­ta­cles of yes­ter­year were out of the ques­tion. Yes­ter­day morn­ing, a small au­di­ence that in­cluded many front-line work­ers bore wit­ness to a sober cer­e­mony with just four march­ing con­tin­gents. Smoke from a 21-gun pres­i­den­tial salute filled the oth­er­wise empty Padang.</p>
    <p>But the thought of the virus did not stop Sin­ga­pore­ans from tak­ing to the streets en masse – but masked – to wave at the tanks, po­lice ve­hi­cles and am­bu­lances rum­bling past.</p>
    <p>They set up camp as early as 8am on the Ma­rina Bar­rage to catch the first mar­itime sail-past in 20 years.</p>
    <p>They peered out of win­dows and caught their breath as F-15 fighter jets roared past, fly­ing in a tight ar­row­head for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing match­ing “I Heart SG” shirts, Ms Fatema Begum, 36, and her fam­ily watched a Chi­nook he­li­copter fly the State flag over the Bar­rage.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is wear­ing a mask but we still came here to cel­e­brate,” said the chef co­or­di­na­tor who works at a ho­tel. “At least it’s still some­thing we can do to mark Na­tional Day.”</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds thronged the edges of fields out­side Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal in Jurong East and Sengkang Gen­eral Hospi­tal to catch the pop­u­lar Red Lion parachutis­ts, who landed out­side th­ese hospi­tals in a trib­ute to front-line health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>On­look­ers packed pedes­trian bridges and even lined the many storeys of IMM mall’s carpark.</p>
    <p>As the drift­ing red specks in the clear sky be­came parachutis­ts glid­ing in for grace­ful land­ings, the cheer­ing reached a fever pitch.</p>
    <p>It was another two hours be­fore the mobile col­umn of mil­i­tary ve­hi­cles and as­sets ap­peared. The day grew swel­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Five-year-old Lykan Ang fid­geted im­pa­tiently with a toy mon­ster truck as his grand­par­ents tried to en­ter­tain him. They pre­vailed upon him to re­cite the Na­tional Pledge, which he oblig­ingly mum­bled his way through, hand on chest.</p>
    <p>Then the tanks turned the cor­ner and he clam­bered ex­cit­edly onto his father’s shoul­ders for a bet­ter view.</p>
    <p>“I hope that Sin­ga­pore will pros­per and get over this Covid-19 cri­sis soon,” said Lykan’s grand­fa­ther Vic­tor Ang, 69, who works in the freight-for­ward­ing in­dus­try. “We have to stay united, help each other and fight through the cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond year in a row that the mobile col­umn was mak­ing its way into the heart­land, but this time, its five routes would cover a record dis­tance of 200km.</p>
    <p>At a traf­fic is­land in Up­per Seran­goon, a small crowd waited in the shade of a fly­over for the mobile col­umn to ar­rive.</p>
    <p>The road cleared. The tanks be­gan rolling by as Gabrael, aged three, and Han­nah, 4½, stared wide-eyed. “Did you wave at the po­lice­man?” their mother Agnes Woo, 41, who works in mar­ket­ing, asked them. “Did you say hello?”</p>
    <p>“It goes to your heart,” re­marked their father Ong Chek Kai, 44, who works in fi­nance, of the sight. “It re­minds us we need to stand to­gether as one against ad­ver­sity, that it is crit­i­cal for us to stand up, move for­ward and get through this.</p>
    <p>“When we wave at them and they wave back to us, I like to think that it con­nects us some­how.”</p>
    <p>In un­der four min­utes, all the mil­i­tary hard­ware had gone by. The bus­tle of noon traf­fic re­sumed, food de­liv­ery rid­ers zip­ping past, hot on the col­umn’s tail.</p>
    <p>Some of the watch­ers pelted down the road, hop­ing to catch the col­umn again as it looped back. Oth­ers wan­dered off to get started on another Sin­ga­porean pas­time: queue­ing for lunch at nearby ko­pi­ti­ams.</p>
    <p>“It’s quite spe­cial,” said ac­coun­tant El­cie Lin, 49, who waited for half an hour to see the col­umn. “I do miss the sta­dium, I miss the large screens, but it’s good that all Sin­ga­pore­ans have a chance to look at the pa­rade up close.”</p>
    <p>As night fell, peo­ple put red fil­ter stick­ers over their phone torch­lights, pre­par­ing to cast a crim­son glow from win­dows and bal­conies.</p>
    <p>At The Star Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre, the lights went up on singer­song­writer Charlie Lim sit­ting alone in an ex­panse of empty seats, as he gave a stripped-down ren­di­tion of his song Room At The Ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Per­form­ers put on a scaled-down show for a live au­di­ence of 150, who were not al­lowed to sing along – though the mil­lions watch­ing from the safety of their homes could.</p>
    <p>As 8.20pm drew near, peo­ple flocked to rooftops, cor­ri­dors and the streets to catch the fire­works be­ing set off at 10 lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>For the sec­ond time that day, a siren sounded is­land­wide, this time to sig­nal Sin­ga­pore­ans to re­cite the Pledge to­gether.</p>
    <p>Then the fire­works went off, to cries of won­der and the crackle of cam­era flashes from blocks of flats and con­do­mini­ums. Mo­torists stopped along the Ben­jamin Sheares Bridge to gawk at the dis­play, to the cha­grin of Traf­fic Po­lice.</p>
    <p>From Jurong Lake Gar­dens to Tampines, from Bis­han to Ma­rina Bay, the night sky bloomed in red, green and gold. Show­ers of light cas­caded into the dark.</p>
    <p>For a mo­ment, the coun­try sighed as one. Ap­plause rang out.</p>
    <p>Then the peo­ple went back into their homes as the fes­tiv­i­ties wound down for the night.</p>

This year&#x2019;s Na&#xAD;tional Day fire&#xAD;works were set off at 10 lo&#xAD;ca&#xAD;tions as cel&#xAD;e&#xAD;bra&#xAD;tions took place all over Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore rather than at a cen&#xAD;tral spot.</p>
