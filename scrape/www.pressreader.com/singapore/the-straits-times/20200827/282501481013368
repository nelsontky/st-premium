    <p>MAS­SACHUSETTS • The world has caught up to Gre­gory Crewd­son. In his large-scale pho­to­graphs, which are pro­duced with a movie crew in bravura Hol­ly­wood style, the peo­ple stare off into space, cloaked in solip­sis­tic mis­ery.</p>
    <p>In the cur­rent locked-down world, his over­wrought i mages seem like faith­ful rep­re­sen­ta­tions of our fraz­zled psy­cho­log­i­cal state.</p>
    <p>“It’s weird how all my pic­tures have taken on a new mean­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>In a masked in­ter­view last month in his stu­dio in Great Bar­ring­ton, Mas­sachusetts, he and Ju­liane Hiam, his stu­dio man­ager and ro­man­tic part­ner, hung his prints, which are more than 2.1m wide and 1.2m high, one by one on the wall. It was the first stu­dio visit since the pan­demic lock­down in March and Crewd­son, 57, a stocky, af­fa­ble man, looked re­laxed in a T-shirt and shorts.</p>
    <p>His most re­cent body of work, a 16-pho­to­graph col­lec­tion he calls An Eclipse Of Moths, will be pre­sented next month at Gagosian in Bev­erly Hills and sub­se­quently in Paris and New York.</p>
    <p>He shot the pic­tures on the out­skirts of Pitts­field, a de­pressed town 32.2km north of his home in the Berk­shires. His cen­tral de­ci­sion when he stages a pho­to­graph is se­lect­ing the site.</p>
    <p>“I spend a lot of time driv­ing around, find­ing lo­ca­tions that can ac­com­mo­date a pic­ture,” Crewd­son said, ex­plain­ing the elab­o­rate scout­ing pro­ce­dure for his con­structed images.</p>
    <p>“Re­turn­ing to these lo­ca­tions, a story will come into my head.”</p>
    <p>He then de­scribes the con­cept to Hiam, who writes a sce­nario that will pro­vide a tem­plate for the shoot.</p>
    <p>“There’s no mo­ti­va­tion, no plot,” he said. “I love the idea of cre­at­ing a mo­ment that has no be­fore and af­ter. I do ev­ery­thing I can to make it as pow­er­ful as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion’s name al­ludes to a term for a clus­ter of the noc­tur­nal fly­ing in­sects, which gather around an il­lu­mi­na­tion source, even­tu­ally ob­scur­ing it. Em­bel­lish­ing his land­scapes, he painted bill­boards and al­tered the street signs. He towed in di­lap­i­dated cars and in­stalled an old telephone booth.</p>
    <p>“We age ev­ery­thing,” he said. “It should all look slightly bro­ken. We work closely with the town. I asked them not to pave any streets, cut any grass. It’s all in the ef­fort of mak­ing a world that is beau­ti­ful and un­set­tling. I want it to feel both time­less and of the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing ap­pears to be out­moded, even the over­head elec­tric wires. He shot An Eclipse Of Moths and pre­vi­ous se­quences of Berk­shires-based pho­to­graphs dur­ing the sum­mer, when the twi­light is pro­longed. Con­ve­niently, he is off from his teach­ing du­ties at Yale, where he is di­rec­tor of grad­u­ate stud­ies in pho­tog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>The sec­tion of Pitts­field where he staged his pic­tures is near a Gen­eral Elec­tric trans­former plant that poi­soned the en­vi­ron­ment with poly­chlo­ri­nated biphenyls, but also em­ployed most of the town. Hiam, who was born in Pitts­field, said: “My par­ents worked for GE. Ev­ery­one I knew had par­ents who came here for GE.”</p>
    <p>Pitts­field was dev­as­tated in 1987 by the clos­ing of the fac­tory, which now looms over the land­scape like a ru­ined cas­tle in a Euro­pean vil­lage.</p>
    <p>But Crewd­son, who as a boy sum­mered in a cabin in the nearby town of Becket with his Brook­lyn-based fam­ily, sees the sur­round­ings from a dif­fer­ent van­tage point.</p>
    <p>“He def­i­nitely feels the area is en­chant­ing,” Hiam said. “It’s the feel­ing a va­ca­tioner would have – the de­tached and en­chanted view. When he takes me around to show his lo­ca­tions, I’m of­ten not see­ing what he is see­ing yet.”</p>
    <p>Crewd­son is a film-maker manque. “Al­most from day one, I was in­ter­ested in the in­ter­sec­tion be­tween movies and a still im­age,” he said. “I love movies maybe above all forms of art – the dream­like qual­ity of go­ing to a movie and watch­ing the light on the screen and be­ing in­tox­i­cated by how that world seems sep­a­rate from our world. But I think in sin­gle images, al­ways. I’m dyslexic and have trou­ble with lin­ear sto­ry­telling.”</p>
    <p>Early in his ca­reer, in the mid 1990s, Crewd­son cre­ated and pho­tographed dio­ra­mas of out-of-scale in­sects and an­i­mals in nat­u­ral set­tings that evoked the un­canny hot­house at­mos­phere of David Lynch’s movie Blue Vel­vet (1986).</p>
    <p>As he ad­vanced, he em­ployed ac­tors and film crews to fab­ri­cate scenes with a sim­i­lar emo­tional pay­off on a grander scale.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing pro­duc­tion, fog ma­chines cloud the air and wa­ter trucks wet the streets. Lights beam down from 24m-high cranes. Un­usu­ally for a pho­tog­ra­pher, he em­ploys a cam­era op­er­a­tor to press the shut­ter and a di­rec­tor of pho­tog­ra­phy to ar­range the light­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’m not com­fort­able hold­ing the cam­era even,” he said. “I’m in­ter­ested in what I see in front of me.”</p>
