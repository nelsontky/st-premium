    <p>Farah Nad­hira Anuwar has long dreamt of be­com­ing a spe­cial needs ed­u­ca­tor and she has started her j our­ney to­wards this goal through the Polytech­nic Foun­da­tion Pro­gramme (PFP).</p>
    <p>“When I was i n se­condary school, I started in­ter­act­ing a lot with my younger cousin (who has Down syn­drome) and that in­spired me to be­come a spe­cial needs teacher,” said the 17-year-old, who is do­ing the Early Child­hood Ed­u­ca­tion course at Te­masek Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>Farah, 17, got i nto the poly through the PFP, which is a oneyear al­ter­na­tive to the Se­condary 5 year. PFP stu­dents are taught foun­da­tional mod­ules by polytech­nic lec­tur­ers at their cho­sen in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>On fin­ish­ing Se­condary 4, she had to choose be­tween con­tin­u­ing on to Se­condary 5 at Com­pass­vale Se­condary School and sub­se­quently O lev­els, the PFP pro­gramme or an­other di­rect route into polytech­nic through the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion known as the Di­rect En­try Scheme to Polytech­nic Pro­gramme (DPP).</p>
    <p>“My teach­ers en­cour­aged me to ap­ply for the PFP as I was el­i­gi­ble for it,” she says.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion year is help­ing her adapt to the changes from se­condary to ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“The course in year 0 cov­ers ba­sic mod­ules, and be­ing ex­posed to the en­vi­ron­ment now in­stead of be­ing dropped right in is mak­ing the tran­si­tion smoother and bet­ter,” she adds.</p>
    <p>She just has to pass her foun­da­tional year to be­gin her three-year course proper, which will set her on the path to her cho­sen pro­fes­sion.</p>
