    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has agreed in prin­ci­ple to live-stream par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He told the House that his min­istry will study the tech­ni­cal and im­ple­men­ta­tion de­tails, and make an an­nounce­ment soon.</p>
    <p>While he said the Gov­ern­ment still holds its ear­lier reser­va­tions about live stream­ing, the min­is­ter noted that global and tech­no­log­i­cal trends have made on­line stream­ing com­mon­place and seen leg­is­la­tures in other coun­tries live-stream­ing pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>In May, then Leader of the House Grace Fu re­jected re­newed calls for live stream­ing, not­ing that there are other av­enues for mem­bers of the pub­lic to watch the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>All speeches and ex­changes in Par­lia­ment are recorded and made avail­able on­line, with video clips up­loaded within hours of each sit­ting. Peo­ple can also choose to view the Hansard or at­tend par­lia­men­tary sit­tings in per­son.</p>
    <p>“These al­ready give us the full ben­e­fits of trans­parency, ac­count­abil­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity,” Mr Iswaran noted.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, he said, has been re­luc­tant to go fur­ther with live stream­ing for both prac­ti­cal and pol­icy rea­sons.</p>
    <p>De­mand for such live broad­casts, even of ma­jor speeches, is gen­er­ally low at only 10 per cent of that of free-to-air tele­vi­sion news.</p>
    <p>And de­bate in Par­lia­ment – a fo­rum for se­ri­ous de­bate on na­tional is­sues – should be vig­or­ous, but with a sober tone, he said.</p>
    <p>“An el­e­ment of cut and thrust is un­avoid­able, even nec­es­sary, be­cause mem­bers want to show Sin­ga­pore­ans that their con­cerns are ex­pressed, and ques­tions asked and an­swered in Par­lia­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, it is equally im­por­tant that mem­bers come to grips with the is­sues and their com­plex­i­ties and not sim­ply play to the gallery. Live broad­casts risk com­pro­mis­ing this.”</p>
    <p>But in the spirit of en­gag­ing with Sin­ga­pore­ans, the Gov­ern­ment will study how to im­ple­ment live stream­ing of Par­lia­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>“Our aim, as al­ways, will be to achieve trans­parency, ac­count­abil­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity while pre­serv­ing the in­tegrity and dig­nity of par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings.”</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran noted that MPs should not just be the voice of the peo­ple in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>They must also be the voice of hope, and the voice of rea­son, he added. “To be can­did about the chal­lenges we face, hon­est about the choices and trade-offs, not just about what we want but also what we have to give up to get it, and ul­ti­mately what we be­lieve to be in the long-term in­ter­est of our cit­i­zens.”</p>
    <p>This is some­thing that MPs should not take lightly, he said.</p>
    <p>“What we say can­not be un­said. It is there for the record for the fu­ture and ev­ery­one – Sin­ga­pore­ans, new cit­i­zens or Sin­ga­pore-born, oth­ers who are here – will all be look­ing at this,” he added.</p>
    <p>“And I think we in this House as elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives must hold our­selves up to a higher stan­dard. If we don’t, then I think we fail our du­ties as Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment, and I think we ul­ti­mately do a dis­ser­vice to Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh said he wel­comed the change, and ac­knowl­edged the Gov­ern­ment’s con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing his as­sur­ance to the min­is­ter, the Work­ers’ Party chief said: “It is our view that that el­e­ment of the­atre will be ex­posed also and the pub­lic will con­clude fairly quickly, if not im­me­di­ately... who is here to turn Par­lia­ment into a the­atre and who is here to be se­ri­ous about Par­lia­ment as a fo­rum where se­ri­ous mat­ters are dis­cussed.”</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran re­sponded that the ex­pe­ri­ence of other coun­tries does not give Sin­ga­pore “a lot of rea­son to be op­ti­mistic in terms of the tone and na­ture of de­bates in Par­lia­ment, and the im­pact such stream­ing or broad­cast­ing will have”.</p>
    <p>“Is there a causal re­la­tion­ship? We don’t know for sure. But there is rea­son to have con­cerns, and that is why I ar­tic­u­lated what I did,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So, what it means is that at the end of the day, it is not ax­iomatic one way or the other, and it de­pends on all of us as par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to main­tain the deco­rum, the dig­nity and the in­tegrity of our pro­ceed­ings through rig­or­ous de­bate based on facts and fo­cused on the long-term in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>PRE­SERV­ING DIG­NITY OF PRO­CEED­INGS</p>
    <p>An el­e­ment of cut and thrust is un­avoid­able, even nec­es­sary, be­cause mem­bers want to show Sin­ga­pore­ans that their con­cerns are ex­pressed, and ques­tions asked and an­swered in Par­lia­ment. How­ever, it is equally im­por­tant that mem­bers come to grips with the is­sues and their com­plex­i­ties and not sim­ply play to the gallery. Live broad­casts risk com­pro­mis­ing this... Our aim, as al­ways, will be to achieve trans­parency, ac­count­abil­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity while pre­serv­ing the in­tegrity and dig­nity of par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>MR S. ISWARAN, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
