    <p>The zom­bie ac­tion movie Train To Busan: Penin­sula is al­ready break­ing records.</p>
    <p>The highly an­tic­i­pated sequel to Train To Busan (2016) has set a Sin­ga­pore open­ing-day record for a South Korean movie with its tak­ings of $147,000, beat­ing the pre­vi­ous open­ing-day high of $119,000 set by fan­tasy ac­tion movie Along With The Gods 2: The Last 49 Days (2018).</p>
    <p>Train To Busan, the first movie, is third at $75,000. It is the high­est-earn­ing South Korean film in Sin­ga­pore with its box-of­fice to­tal of $5.35 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The open­ing-day per­for­mance of the sequel di­rected by Yeon Sang-ho, star­ring Gang Dong-won and Lee Jung-hyun, comes de­spite coro­n­avirus so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures such as a limit of 50 pa­trons per screen­ing and the re­quire­ment for pa­trons to wear masks.</p>
    <p>Train To Busan: Penin­sula opened on 97 screens on Wed­nes­day across the is­land in a pe­riod when Hol­ly­wood block­buster re­leases have been post­poned to next month and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Its strong per­for­mance will cheer cin­ema op­er­a­tors, which had re­opened cin­e­mas on Mon­day, af­ter hav­ing closed them on March 27 in a bid to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the clo­sures, there were signs of de­clin­ing at­ten­dance due to wor­ries about in­fec­tion.</p>
