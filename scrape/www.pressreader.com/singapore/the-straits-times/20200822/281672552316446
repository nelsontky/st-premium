    <p>If there are in­stances where for­eign work­ers are not be­ing paid, the Govern­ment will ap­proach the em­ployer to find out what is go­ing on as it ex­pects em­ploy­ers to do their part and pay their work­ers, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on com­plaints over for­eign work­ers who had not been paid or were un­able to re­turn to work as they were with­out jobs.</p>
    <p>“The Govern­ment has been pro­vid­ing con­sid­er­able sup­port to em­ploy­ers, and we do ex­pect em­ploy­ers to do their part to con­tinue to pay the work­ers,” Mr Wong said dur­ing a multi-min­istry task force vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong added that for pay is­sues, whether as a Sin­ga­porean or for­eign worker, one should alert the Man­power Min­istry (MOM) so it can take up the is­sue with the em­ployer ap­pro­pri­ately.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to en­sure that our work­ers get paid,” said Mr Gan, re­gard­less of whether one is a lo­cal or mi­grant worker.</p>
    <p>On work­ers be­ing un­able to re­turn to work, Mr Wong, who cochairs the task force with Mr Gan, said feed­back from many em­ploy­ers was that they were very ea­ger to have their work­ers re­sume work as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he noted that there could be sev­eral rea­sons why this was not yet pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>One is that the work could be tied to other parts of the ecosys­tem of con­trac­tors, some of whom still have is­sues to sort out, so the projects are still sus­pended.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son that work is un­able to re­sume could be the em­ployer is un­able to meet cer­tain safe dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added that with the gen­eral slow­ing of the econ­omy, some em­ploy­ers may not have work for their work­ers.</p>
    <p>“MOM has ex­er­cised flex­i­bil­ity to al­low some of these (mi­grant work­ers) to switch em­ploy­ers so that they can find jobs while in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said some mi­grant work­ers may de­cide to re­turn to their home coun­tries as they pre­fer to be re­united with their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>While help is be­ing given to fa­cil­i­tate their repa­tri­a­tion, this also de­pends on whether the mi­grant work­ers are al­lowed to re­turn or whether they have met the re­quire­ments of their home coun­try be­fore re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>De­spite these fac­tors, Mr Wong said more and more cleared work­ers have been re­turn­ing to the work­place.</p>
    <p>This ties in with the time­line for all dor­mi­to­ries to be de­clared clear of Covid-19, which was an­nounced by MOM on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>While the dor­mi­to­ries have been cleared, there will be a bit of a time lag be­fore all work­ers are able to re­sume work, said Mr Wong.</p>
