        | | B18 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 OUR SINGAPORE, WITH LOVE Capturing the spirit of National Day Discover how a team of designers found inspiratio­n for creative IG fılters to mark the country’s 55th birthday BY RACHEL TAN T his year’s National Day is certainly unlike any other, with safe distancing protocols whittling down spectators for the annual National Day Parade (NDP) from tens of thousands to just around 150. Just like how a heavy downpour could not put a damper on the parade of 1968, the celebratio­ns this year will go on — albeit largely in front of television, computer and phone screens.
On a quest to capture the celebrator­y mood of NDP and all things uniquely Singapore is a 10-member team of designers and illustrato­rs from Singapore Press Holdings’ (SPH) Media Solutions Division. The team created four Instagram (IG) fılters as part of a contest jointly organised by SPH and Samsung to encourage Singaporea­ns to express their birthday wishes and love for the nation on social media.
The four key designers behind the project are Mr Cheong Wee Teck, Ms Ng Mui Choo, Ms Ng Weng Chi and Mr Raymond Sutisna.
With the NDP celebratio­ns going virtual this year, online engagement plays a signifıcan­t role in getting people into the National Day mood, says Mr Cheong.
Ms Ng Weng Chi says: “While large crowds and gatherings are out of the question, we still wanted to offer users the experience of celebratin­g National Day together with one another and being part of a bigger movement.”
The designers came up with four National Day-inspired background­s While large crowds and gatherings are out of the question, we still wanted to offer users the experience of celebratin­g National Day together with one another and being part of a bigger movement. another fılter inspired by the wildly popular Xue Hua Piao Piao meme.
Beyond the tight deadlines, the project marked several fırsts for the team.
For Mr Sutisna and Ms Ng Weng Chi, who worked on the illustrati­ons and animations, their fırst IG fılter project forced them to think out of the box and pushed their boundaries in the creative process. “How can I fınd the right balance of colours for the fıreworks? What is the best opacity for a night background? These were the questions I kept asking myself,” says Ms Ng.
Mr Sutisna, who is used to working in the landscape orientatio­n, had to adapt to the portrait frame when designing the backdrops. It was also his fırst time creating illustrati­ons using the Samsung S Pen.
“It was diffıcult to get the placement of the elements right the fırst time,” he says. “A big part of the challenge was to think ahead and imagine how users might want to use the fılters and have fun with it.”

It also depicts iconic NDP staples like the Red Lions and the state flag bearing Chinooks, symbolisin­g the nation’s independen­ce and pride.” FILTER: FILTER: WHY: The Merlion
“It’s very cute and I believe users can really explore creative and unexpected executions with the Merlion and water, which is what we hope to inspire with the filters.” NDP crowd “Now that everyone is social distancing, this filter helps you feel like you’re part of the crowd. I also illustrate­d it based on my experience of attending the parade, both as a participan­t during National Service and as a spectator.” FILTER: Singapore skyline with fireworks “Besides the fact that I worked the most on it, this filter is quite special as it reminds me of my family tradition of booking a hotel room and watching the fireworks together every National Day.” WHY: that will strike a chord with Singaporea­ns: a flypast with the Red Lions in the sky, an NDP crowd, the Merlion and the Singapore skyline being lit up by fıreworks.
The IG fılters are engaging and interactiv­e so users can have fun expressing themselves, they emphasise.
Other quirky and trendy ideas that the team had come up with include a National Day song randomiser fılter where users had to sing the song reflected on their smartphone­s, and WHY: PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
