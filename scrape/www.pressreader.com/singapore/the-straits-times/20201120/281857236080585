    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin and his slim-ma­jor­ity gov­ern­ment are back on safe ground for now, af­ter Malaysia’s King on Wed­nes­day con­sented to an emer­gency dec­la­ra­tion that ef­fec­tively post­poned a by-elec­tion, amid the coun­try’s worst wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts and po­lit­i­cal in­sid­ers see the King’s agree­ment to de­lay the Dec 5 vote for the lit­tle-known coastal town of Batu Sapi in east­ern-most Malaysia as a clear sig­nal from Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah that snap na­tional polls will not hap­pen un­til the pandemic is sub­dued.</p>
    <p>This comes as doubt con­tin­ues to fes­ter over whether Tan Sri Muhyid­din can pass next year’s bud­get, with a vote to be taken next Thurs­day. Based on the last par­lia­men­tary vote in Au­gust, his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact cur­rently has 112 MPs against the op­po­si­tion’s 108. The re­main­ing two seats in Par­lia­ment are va­cant af­ter two law­mak­ers re­cently passed away.</p>
    <p>“The King’s de­ci­sion means Muhyid­din will likely be safe for now as re­cent at­tempts to form an al­ter­na­tive gov­ern­ment have failed. But hos­til­i­ties within the rul­ing coali­tion have paused rather than ceased, and are set to re­sume af­ter the bud­get vote or pos­si­bly even be­fore,” Eura­sia Group Asia di­rec­tor Peter Mum­ford told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah has ad­vised all law­mak­ers to ap­prove the bud­get in the in­ter­ests of the coun­try, and to en­sure suf­fi­cient fund­ing for the on­go­ing fight against the coro­n­avirus and its eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Muhyid­din con­tin­ues to</p>
    <p>be kept on his toes by Umno, the largest party in his PN pact, which had pre­vi­ously threat­ened to with­hold its sup­port.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi called for the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion to “make it a pri­or­ity to bring a mo­tion of con­fi­dence” to the floor.</p>
    <p>The Umno chief added that the man­date “should be re­turned to the pub­lic as soon as pos­si­ble” at the bal­lot box, af­ter mak­ing thinly veiled crit­i­cisms of Mr Muhyid­din and his Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia’s lack of sin­cer­ity in co­op­er­at­ing with al­lies.</p>
    <p>TEN­TA­TIVE STA­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>The King’s de­ci­sion means Muhyid­din will likely be safe for now as re­cent at­tempts to form an al­ter­na­tive gov­ern­ment have failed. But hos­til­i­ties within the rul­ing coali­tion have paused rather than ceased.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say Zahid’s move is aimed at en­sur­ing his own sur­vival and pri­macy within Umno, it­self riven by fac­tions aligned with and against Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>“He is sug­gest­ing the gov­ern­ment may not have the num­bers. An early general elec­tion is the best case for Umno. Even if it is not pos­si­ble, he is send­ing a mes­sage to the party that he will not back down,” Bow­erGroupAsi­a po­lit­i­cal risk con­sul­tant Adib Zalka­pli told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Zahid and his sup­port­ers are ag­grieved at be­ing side­lined from po­si­tions of power and de­ci­sion-mak­ing within the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The for­mer deputy pre­mier had been will­ing to team up with Leader of the Op­po­si­tion An­war Ibrahim to form a new gov­ern­ment to re­place PN, but the move fiz­zled out last month af­ter Umno and the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party, part of Datuk Seri An­war’s Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion, re­fused to work with each other.</p>
    <p>Zahid is fac­ing 87 charges of graft, although court hear­ings are de­layed in­def­i­nitely, with most of the coun­try un­der a par­tial lock­down. Umno party polls are also due next year, but its top lead­er­ship coun­cil can opt to de­lay it for 18 months.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last week that health of­fi­cials have ad­vised the gov­ern­ment that a na­tional vote may not be pos­si­ble un­til late next year, ow­ing to the sever­ity of the new Covid-19 wave. How­ever, re­ports of vac­cines en­ter­ing late-stage tri­als have given some hope that nor­malcy can re­turn ear­lier next year.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion has swirled that Mr An­war and Zahid were still sign­ing up law­mak­ers this week to even­tu­ally top­ple the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion, whether or not the bud­get passes.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial from the rul­ing pact privy to dis­cus­sions be­tween Mr Muhyid­din and Zahid told The Straits Times that “the only source of po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty now is whether Umno is com­mit­ted to the ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Umno’s lead­er­ship is split into sev­eral camps and they will need to even­tu­ally de­cide if they are with Zahid or not,” he said.</p>
