    <p>With prime of­fice blocks l ying empty around the world, ho­tels half-va­cant and re­tail­ers strug­gling to stay afloat due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, sov­er­eign wealth funds are re­treat­ing from many of the real es­tate in­vest­ments that have long been a main­stay of their strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Sov­er­eign wealth funds (SWFs) in­vested US$4.4 bil­lion (S$6 bil­lion) in the sec­tor in the first seven months of this year, 65 per cent down from the same pe­riod a year ago, ac­cord­ing to pre­vi­ously un­pub­lished data pro­vided to Reuters by Global SWF, an in­dus­try data spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>The na­ture of prop­erty in­vest­ments is also shift­ing, with funds in­creas­ingly in­vest­ing in lo­gis­tics space, such as ware­hous­ing, amid a boom in on­line com­merce dur­ing the pan­demic, while cut­ting back on deals for of­fices and re­tail build­ings.</p>
    <p>Such shifts in be­hav­iour can have seis­mic ef­fects on the global real es­tate mar­ket, given that such funds are among the largest in­vestors in prop­erty and have in­ter­ests worth hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars in to­tal. Three sov­er­eign f unds sit within the top 10 largest real es­tate in­vestors, ac­cord­ing to mar­ket spe­cial­ists IPE Real As­sets.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen if the changes are struc­tural for the funds, for which prop­erty is an as­set-class sta­ple at about 8 per cent of their to­tal port­fo­lios on av­er­age, or a tem­po­rary re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“Real es­tate is still a big part of sov­er­eign wealth fund port­fo­lios and will con­tinue to be so,” said Mr Diego Lopez, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Global SWF and a for­mer sov­er­eign wealth fund ad­viser at PwC.</p>
    <p>“What Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated is the so­phis­ti­ca­tion of SWFs try­ing to build di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and re­silience into their port­fo­lio – and hence l ook­ing for other as­set classes and in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>Sov­er­eign funds have been more bear­ish on prop­erty than pub­lic pen­sion funds, another big in­vestor in the sec­tor, Global SWF found. While they have out­stripped pen­sion funds in over­all in­vest­ment across most in­dus­tries and as­sets this year, by two to one, that ra­tio is re­versed for real es­tate.</p>
    <p>FU­TURE OF THE OF­FICE</p>
    <p>Funds are nurs­ing hits to their ex­ist­ing prop­erty port­fo­lios stem­ming from the in­tro­duc­tion of lock­downs and so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions. While other parts of their port­fo­lio, such as stocks and bonds, have re­bounded from March’s trough, a real es­tate re­cov­ery is less as­sured.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, prop­erty cap­i­tal value is ex­pected to drop by 14 per cent this year be­fore ris­ing by 3.4 per cent next year, ac­cord­ing to com­mer­cial real es­tate ser­vices group CBRE. An­a­lysts and aca­demics question whether the pan­demic’s im­pact may prove long-last­ing, with more peo­ple work­ing from home and shop­ping on­line.</p>
    <p>Ms Yolande Barnes, a real es­tate spe­cial­ist at Lon­don univer­sity UCL, said: “I think there’s a real threat to some com­mer­cial busi­ness dis­tricts in the big cities as I can’t see us all re­turn to the nineto-five schlep in, schlep out.”</p>
    <p>The value of prop­erty as­sets of some funds has fallen this year. Those ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the big­gest drops in­clude Sin­ga­pore’s Temasek and GIC, Abu Dhabi In­vest­ment Author­ity and Qatar In­vest­ment Author­ity (QIA), ac­cord­ing to data com­piled for Reuters by in­dus­try tracker Pre­qin.</p>
    <p>Those four funds have col­lec­tively seen the value of such as­sets drop by US$18.1 bil­lion to US$132.9 bil­lion, the data showed.</p>
    <p>Reuters was un­able to con­firm whether the fall was due to lower val­u­a­tions or as­set sales. The funds ei­ther de­clined to com­ment or did not re­spond. Many sov­er­eign funds do not pub­licly dis­close data on prop­erty in­vest­ments, with Nor­way’s one of the ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian fund, which has around US$49 bil­lion in­vested in real es­tate, up from US$47 bil­lion at the end of last year, said last week that its un­listed prop­erty port­fo­lio re­turned mi­nus 1.6 per cent in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>Sov­er­eign funds have also largely steered clear this year of new di­rect in­vest­ments in Lon­don or Los An­ge­les, hot spots in nor­mal times, ac­cord­ing to prop­erty ser­vices firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which said SWFs were “on the de­fen­sive”.</p>
    <p>The funds’ ad­vance in lo­gis­tics prop­er­ties, such as ware­hous­ing and goods dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres, comes at a time of high de­mand as peo­ple have bought ev­ery­thing from toi­let paper to train­ers from home dur­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>So far this year, lo­gis­tics have ac­counted for about 22 per cent of funds’ real es­tate in­vest­ments by value, com­pared with 15 per cent in 2019 as a whole, the Global SWF data shows.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­vest­ments in of­fices have fallen to 36 per cent from 49 per cent last year, and in re­tail prop­erty, to zero ver­sus 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­cus Framp­ton, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer of Alaska Per­ma­nent Fund Cor­po­ra­tion, told Reuters that real es­tate deal vol­umes had “slowed down sub­stan­tially” in gen­eral, but that anec­do­tally, he saw ac­tiv­ity in in­dus­trial fa­cil­i­ties such as lo­gis­tics and “mul­ti­fam­ily” apart­ment blocks.</p>
    <p>The wealth fund’s hold­ings have risen to US$4.7 bil­lion, up from US$4 bil­lion at the end of June, af­ter the pur­chase of multi-fam­ily and in­dus­trial Reit (real es­tate in­vest­ment trust) stocks on July 1, Mr Framp­ton said. “Com­mer­cial ware­house ac­tiv­ity is strong,” he added.</p>
    <p>In a sign of the times, Temasek par­tic­i­pated in a US$500 mil­lion in­vest­ment in In­done­sia-based ecom­merce firm Toko­pe­dia in June.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, phys­i­cal re­tail, a sig­nif­i­cant part of many funds’ hold­ings, has been hit hard. QIA-owned lux­ury re­tailer Har­rods in Lon­don has fore­cast a 45 per cent plunge in an­nual sales, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Ms Barnes said sov­er­eign funds could be “lighter on their feet” than some other in­sti­tu­tional funds and more able to ad­just their be­hav­iour to suit chang­ing cir­cum­stances.</p>
