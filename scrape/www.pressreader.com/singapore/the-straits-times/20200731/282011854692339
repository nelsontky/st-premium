    <p>Many of the re­cent re­forms in the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem arose from feed­back and in­put from teach­ers and staff at the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE), Mr Lawrence Wong said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who is the newly ap­pointed Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter, told teach­ers and staff that he will con­tinue to en­gage them, with the help of Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Ma­liki Os­man, as well as Ms Sun Xuel­ing and Ms Gan Siow Huang, who are both Min­is­ters of State for Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­nal memo seen by The Straits Times yes­ter­day, Mr Wong said: “(We will) con­sider your ideas for pro­grammes and ini­tia­tives to help ev­ery stu­dent achieve their fullest po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>“We want to ben­e­fit from your in­sights, and your ex­pe­ri­ence on the ground in­ter­act­ing with our stu­dents. Our doors are al­ways open, as we con­tinue to look for ways to do bet­ter and im­prove.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who served as Min­is­ter of State and then Se­nior Min­is­ter of State at MOE from May 2011 to Novem­ber 2012, said he “firmly be­lieves that the key in­gre­di­ent be­hind the suc­cess of our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem lies with our out­stand­ing team of leaders, ed­u­ca­tors and al­lied ed­u­ca­tors”.</p>
    <p>He noted that some teach­ers and staff were in­volved in var­i­ous re­views and in com­ing up with spe­cific rec­om­men­da­tions for change.</p>
    <p>“These changes are still work in progress, and I look for­ward to work­ing with all of you to see them through,” he added.</p>
    <p>Some re­forms in­clude re­vamp­ing the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion scor­ing sys­tem, phas­ing out stream­ing, re­duc­ing exam loads, and uplifting stu­dents from vul­ner­a­ble back­grounds.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said: “At the heart of these changes is the recog­ni­tion that our chil­dren are not de­fined by their grades; that ed­u­ca­tion is much more than do­ing well in ex­ams or be­ing filled with knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>“It is about light­ing that fire of cu­rios­ity in our young peo­ple, and help­ing them dis­cover their unique tal­ents to do great things.”</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter noted that the Covid-19 out­break has been a dif­fi­cult time for teach­ers, who have had to adapt to home-based learn­ing, as well as safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in school.</p>
    <p>Thank­ing them for their ef­forts in keep­ing stu­dents safe dur­ing this pe­riod, Mr Wong said: “At the end of the day, we are all here as one MOE fam­ily be­cause we be­lieve in the im­por­tance of ed­u­ca­tion and the in­trin­sic worth of ev­ery child.</p>
    <p>“Ed­u­ca­tion is the most pre­cious gift for our chil­dren. It’s also the most crit­i­cal in­vest­ment for our peo­ple and so­ci­ety in a rapidly chang­ing world.”</p>
