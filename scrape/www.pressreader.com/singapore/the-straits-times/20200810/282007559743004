    <p>Had it not been for the rev­o­lu­tion in France, Ed­mund Burke would likely have been re­mem­bered, a bit vaguely, as an 18th-cen­tury philoso­pher-states­man of extravagan­t rhetor­i­cal gifts but frus­trat­ingly am­biva­lent views.</p>
    <p>The Ir­ish-born mem­ber of the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment was sym­pa­thetic to the griev­ances of the Amer­i­can colonies but not (like his one-time friend Thomas Paine) an en­thu­si­as­tic cham­pion of their in­de­pen­dence; an acer­bic critic of Ge­orge III but a firm de­fender of monar­chy; a staunch op­po­nent of English ra­pac­ity in In­dia but a sup­porter of Bri­tish Em­pire; an ad­vo­cate for the grad­ual eman­ci­pa­tion of at least some slaves, but no be­liever in equal­ity.</p>
    <p>He was also an un­abashed snob. “The oc­cu­pa­tion of a hair­dresser,” he wrote, “can­not be a mat­ter of hon­our to any per­son.”</p>
    <p>Burke’s name en­dures be­cause of his un­com­pro­mis­ing op­po­si­tion to the French Rev­o­lu­tion – a view he laid out as some of Bri­tain’s more lib­eral thinkers thought it rep­re­sented hu­man­ity’s best hopes. Re­flec­tions On The Rev­o­lu­tion In France was pub­lished in Novem­ber 1790, more than a year af­ter the fall of the Bastille but be­fore the Reign of Ter­ror, when it still seemed pos­si­ble that Louis XVI would sur­vive as a constituti­onal monarch and the coun­try wouldn’t de­scend into a blood bath.</p>
    <p>Burke fore­saw, more ac­cu­rately than most of his great con­tem­po­raries, what the rev­o­lu­tion would bring: the ex­e­cu­tions of Louis and Marie An­toinette; the in­ef­fec­tu­al­ity of mod­er­ate rev­o­lu­tion­ary lead­ers (“a sort of peo­ple who af­fect to pro­ceed as if they thought that men may de­ceive with­out fraud, rob with­out in­jus­tice, and over­turn every thing with­out vi­o­lence”); the rise of a mil­i­tary dic­ta­tor in the mould of Napoleon; and a long Euro­pean war in which the “Repub­lic of Regi­cide” would seek to sub­ju­gate the world in the name of lib­er­at­ing it.</p>
    <p>How did Burke get it right about the ul­ti­mate course of events in France – and, by ex­ten­sion, so many later rev­o­lu­tions that aimed to es­tab­lish morally en­light­ened so­ci­eties and wound up pro­duc­ing despo­tism and ter­ror?</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is worth pon­der­ing in the light of two main ide­o­log­i­cal cur­rents of to­day: the tear-it-all-down pop­ulism that has swept so much of the right in the past five years and the tear-it-all-down pro­gres­sivism that threat­ens to sweep the left.</p>
    <p>At the core of Burke’s view of the rev­o­lu­tion is a pro­found un­der­stand­ing of how eas­ily things can be shat­tered in the name of moral bet­ter­ment, na­tional pu­rifi­ca­tion and rad­i­cal po­lit­i­cal trans­for­ma­tion. States, so­ci­eties and per­sonal con­sciences are not Lego-block con­struc­tions to be dis­as­sem­bled and re­assem­bled with ease. They are more like ta­pes­tries, passed from one gen­er­a­tion to the next, to be care­fully mended at one edge, grace­fully en­larged on the other and oth­er­wise han­dled with cau­tion lest a sin­gle pulled thread un­ravel the en­tire pat­tern.</p>
    <p>“The na­ture of man is in­tri­cate; the ob­jects of so­ci­ety are of the great­est pos­si­ble com­plex­ity,” the philoso­pher wrote. “And there­fore no sim­ple dis­po­si­tion or direc­tion of power can be suitable ei­ther to man’s na­ture, or to the qual­ity of his af­fairs.”</p>
    <p>Burke’s ob­jec­tion to the French rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies is that they paid so lit­tle at­ten­tion to this com­plex­ity: They were men of the­ory, not ex­pe­ri­ence. Men of ex­pe­ri­ence tend to be cau­tious about gam­bling what they have painstak­ingly gained. Men of the­ory tend to be reck­less with what they’ve in­her­ited but never earned.</p>
    <p>“They have wrought un­der­ground a mine that will blow up, at one grand ex­plo­sion, all ex­am­ples of an­tiq­uity, all prece­dents, char­ters, and acts of Par­lia­ment. They have ‘the rights of men’. Against th­ese there can be no pre­scrip­tions.”</p>
    <p>Not that Burke was against rights per se. The usual car­i­ca­ture of Burke is that he is the con­ser­va­tive’s con­ser­va­tive, a man for whom any type of change was dan­ger­ous in prac­tice and anath­ema on prin­ci­ple. That view of him would have as­ton­ished his con­tem­po­raries, who knew him as a cham­pion of Catholic eman­ci­pa­tion – the civil rights move­ment of his day – and other re­formist (of­ten un­pop­u­lar) causes.</p>
    <p>A fairer read­ing of Burke would de­scribe him as ei­ther a near-lib­eral or a near-con­ser­va­tive – a man who de­fied easy cat­e­gori­sa­tion in his time and de­fies it again in ours. He be­lieved in lim­ited govern­ment, grad­ual re­form, par­lia­men­tary sovereignt­y and, with caveats and qual­i­fi­ca­tions, in­di­vid­ual rights.</p>
    <p>But he also be­lieved that to se­cure rights, it wasn’t enough sim­ply to de­clare them on pa­per, cod­ify them in law and claim them as en­ti­tle­ments from a divine be­ing or the gen­eral will. The con­di­tions of lib­erty had to be nur­tured through pru­dent states­man­ship, moral ed­u­ca­tion, na­tional and lo­cal loy­al­ties, at­ten­tion to cir­cum­stance and a healthy re­spect for the</p>
    <p>“la­tent wis­dom” of long-es­tab­lished cus­toms and be­liefs. If Burke lacked Thomas Jef­fer­son’s clar­ity and ide­al­ism, he never suf­fered from his hypocrisy.</p>
    <p>All of this may sound sus­pi­cious to mod­ern read­ers, es­pe­cially pro­gres­sive ones. But con­sider what Burke might have made of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Trump­ism. He would have been be­mused by the phrase “drain the swamp”: To take the metaphor se­ri­ously, one would end up de­stroy­ing all the life within the swamp, leav­ing only mud. He would have been re­volted by the Trump fam­ily’s self-deal­ing: Among the great causes of Burke’s life was his role in the im­peach­ment of War­ren Hast­ings, the de facto gov­er­nor-gen­eral of In­dia, for cor­rupt and cruel ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Above all, Burke would have been dis­gusted by Mr Trump’s man­ners. “Man­ners are of more im­por­tance than laws,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“The law touches us but here and there, and now and then. Man­ners are what vex or soothe, cor­rupt or pu­rify, ex­alt or de­base, bar­barise or re­fine us... They give their whole form and colour to our lives. Ac­cord­ing to their qual­ity, they aid morals, they sup­ply them, or they totally de­stroy them.”</p>
    <p>Burke’s un­der­stand­ing of the cen­tral­ity of man­ners to norms, of norms to morals, of morals to cul­ture and of cul­ture to the health of the po­lit­i­cal or­der means that he would have been unimpresse­d by claims that Mr Trump had scored pol­icy “wins”, like ap­point­ing con­ser­va­tive judges or cut­ting the cor­po­rate tax rate. Those would have been baubles float­ing in be­fouled wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s real legacy, in Burke’s eyes, would be his de­base­ment of po­lit­i­cal cul­ture; per­sonal pro­pri­ety; of re­spect for in­sti­tu­tions; of care for tra­di­tion; of trust be­tween cit­i­zens and civil author­ity; of a so­ci­ety that be­lieves – and has rea­son to be­lieve – in its own es­sen­tial de­cency. He wrote: “To make us love our coun­try, our coun­try ought to be lovely.”</p>
    <p>Then again, Burke would have been no less with­er­ing in his views of the far left. “You be­gan ill,” he said of the French rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies, “be­cause you be­gan by de­spis­ing ev­ery­thing that be­longed to you.”</p>
    <p>For Burke, the ma­te­ri­als of suc­cess­ful so­cial change had to be found in what the coun­try al­ready pro­vided – his­tor­i­cally, cul­tur­ally, in­sti­tu­tion­ally – not in what it lacked. Bri­tain be­came the most lib­eral so­ci­ety of its day, Burke ar­gued, be­cause it held fast to what he called “our an­cient, in­dis­putable laws and lib­er­ties”, handed down “as an in­her­i­tance from our fore­fa­thers”.</p>
    <p>In­her­i­tance, he added, “fur­nishes a sure prin­ci­ple of trans­mis­sion; with­out at all ex­clud­ing a prin­ci­ple of im­prove­ment”. The peo­ple now pulling down stat­ues of Thomas Jef­fer­son and Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton and spray-paint­ing “1619” on them may be­lieve they are strik­ing a blow against the racial hypocrisy of the found­ing fa­thers. But if Burke were alive now, he would likely note that peo­ple who trade an­cient lib­er­ties – free­dom of speech, for in­stance – for new­fan­gled rights (free­dom from speech) could soon wind up with nei­ther.</p>
    <p>He’d ob­serve that it may not be easy to teach re­spect for demo­cratic po­lit­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions while in­cul­cat­ing con­tempt for the founders of those in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>He’d sug­gest that if pro­test­ers want to make the case for fuller equal­ity for all Amer­i­cans, it would be bet­ter to en­list the mem­ory of the founders in their cause than hand them over to their po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents to cham­pion. He’d cau­tion that de­struc­tive­ness to­wards prop­erty tends to lead to vi­o­lence to­wards peo­ple.</p>
    <p>And he’d warn that the dam­age be­ing done – to civil or­der, public prop­erty and, most of all per­haps, to the val­ues demonstrat­ors claim to cham­pion – may not be easy to undo. “Rage and phrensy will pull down more in half an hour, than pru­dence, de­lib­er­a­tion and fore­sight can build up in a hun­dred years,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Be­cause Burke cham­pi­ons a dif­fer­ent con­cept of lib­erty than the one most Amer­i­cans cher­ish, it may be easy to dis­miss his teach­ings as in­ter­est­ing but ul­ti­mately ir­rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>Lib­er­tar­ian-con­ser­va­tive Ge­orge Will, in his magnum opus The Con­ser­va­tive Sen­si­bil­ity, speaks of Burke as a “throne-and-al­tar” con­ser­va­tive of lit­tle rel­e­vance to Amer­i­can ex­pe­ri­ence. What­ever else might be said of events in places like Port­land or Seat­tle, it is not the storm­ing of the Bastille, and wo­ke­ness isn’t Ja­cobin­ism – at least not yet. The time to write Re­flec­tions On The Rev­o­lu­tions In Amer­ica is still a ways off.</p>
    <p>A ways off – but ever more vis­i­ble on the hori­zon. To read and ad­mire Burke does not re­quire us to em­brace his views, much less treat him as a prophet. But it’s an op­por­tu­nity to learn some­thing from a man who saw, more clearly than most, how “very plau­si­ble schemes, with very pleas­ing com­mence­ments, have of­ten shame­ful and lam­en­ta­ble con­clu­sions”.</p>
