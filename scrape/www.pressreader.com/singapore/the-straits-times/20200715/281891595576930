    <p>HONG KONG • In the past two weeks, Hong Kong pub­lisher Ray­mond Ye­ung has hastily made changes to a draft copy of a book en­ti­tled To Free­dom, re­plac­ing “revo­lu­tion” with “protests”, tweak­ing a banned slo­gan and cut­ting pas­sages that ad­vo­cate in­de­pen­dence for the Chi­nese-ruled city.</p>
    <p>The changes were hard to make, he said, but un­avoid­able since China passed a na­tional se­cu­rity law mak­ing se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces crimes pun­ish­able by up to life in prison.</p>
    <p>“This is re­ally pain­ful,” Mr Ye­ung said as he flipped through pages of the col­lec­tion of es­says by 50 protesters, lawyers, so­cial work­ers and other par­tic­i­pants in the prodemoc­racy demon­stra­tions that shook Hong Kong last year.</p>
    <p>“This is his­tory. This is the truth,” he said, hold­ing up the book with blue sticky flags on many pages to mark the changes made.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s once-un­bri­dled and pro­lific in­de­pen­dent pub­lish­ers are now cen­sor­ing them­selves in the face of the new law. In the past two weeks, pub­lic libraries have taken some books off the shelves, shops have re­moved protest-re­lated dec­o­ra­tions, and the slo­gan “Lib­er­ate Hong Kong! Revo­lu­tion of our times” has been de­clared il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>To Free­dom is the first po­lit­i­cal book Mr Ye­ung has taken on as a part-time pub­lisher. Af­ter Bei­jing in­tro­duced the se­cu­rity law, the book’s orig­i­nal printer bailed, and two oth­ers de­clined, he said.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong Trade De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil, which or­gan­ises the an­nual Hong Kong Book Fair, told ex­hibitors not to dis­play “un­law­ful books” at this week’s planned fair.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil post­poned the fair at the last minute on Mon­day, due to a re­cent spike in coro­n­avirus cases. It did not set a new date for the event.</p>
    <p>Non-gov­ern­men­tal pro-Bei­jing groups had teamed up to urge peo­ple to re­port stalls at the fair selling ma­te­rial pro­mot­ing Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence, a sub­ject that is anath­ema to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Every cit­i­zen has a duty to re­port crime,” said Mr Innes Tang, chair­man of Poli­tiHK So­cial Strate­gic, a group be­hind the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran lo­cal pub­lisher Jimmy Pang, who has par­tic­i­pated in every fair since it be­gan in 1990, called 2020 “the most ter­ri­fy­ing year” be­cause of the se­cu­rity law and the eco­nomic down­turn that was al­ready hurt­ing pub­lish­ers.</p>
    <p>He said the law has prompted pub­lish­ing houses and writ­ers to halt projects while print­ers, distrib­u­tors and book­stores have turned down sen­si­tive books. For ex­am­ple, lo­cal Chris­tian pub­li­ca­tion Breakazine said it halted dis­tri­bu­tion of its midJuly issue called “Dan­ger­ous Read­ing” while seek­ing le­gal ad­vice for nav­i­gat­ing the new law.</p>
    <p>“Every­one is avoid­ing risks by suf­fer­ing in si­lence,” said Mr Pang, a spokesman for 50 ex­hibitors at the fair. “In the fu­ture, there will be no sen­si­tive books re­lated to pol­i­tics.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bao Pu, son of Bao Tong, the most se­nior Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party of­fi­cial jailed for sym­pa­this­ing with Tianan­men protesters, founded New Cen­tury Press in 2005 in Hong Kong to pub­lish books based on mem­oirs, gov­ern­ment doc­u­ments and other sources that of­ten dif­fer from China’s of­fi­cial ver­sions of events and could not be pub­lished on the main­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Bao said he no longer plans to pub­lish such books in Hong Kong, but urged other pub­lish­ers to avoid self-cen­sor­ship. “If ev­ery­body does that, then the law would have much more im­pact on free­dom of speech,” he said.</p>
