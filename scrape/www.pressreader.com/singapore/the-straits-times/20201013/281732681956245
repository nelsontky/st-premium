    <p>WASHINGTON • Twit­ter on Sun­day flagged a tweet by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in which he claimed he was im­mune to the coro­n­avirus, say­ing it vi­o­lated the so­cial me­dia plat­form’s rules about mis­lead­ing in­for­ma­tion re­lated to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“A to­tal and com­plete sign off from White House Doc­tors yes­ter­day. That means I can’t get it (im­mune), and can’t give it. Very nice to know,” Mr Trump tweeted.</p>
    <p>The post was flagged by Twit­ter with a dis­claimer: “This Tweet vi­o­lated the Twit­ter Rules about spread­ing mis­lead­ing and po­ten­tially harm­ful in­for­ma­tion re­lated to Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>A Twit­ter spokesman said the tweet made “mis­lead­ing health claims” about Covid-19 and that en­gage­ments with the post would be “sig­nif­i­cantly lim­ited”, as is stan­dard in such cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Sun­day said he had fully re­cov­ered from Covid-19 and would not be a trans­mis­sion risk, free­ing him to hold big cam­paign ral­lies again in the fi­nal weeks of the race for the White House.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent first an­nounced he had had a pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus test on Oct 2. Mr Trump’s physi­cian last Satur­day said the Pres­i­dent had taken a test show­ing he was no longer in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The sci­ence is un­clear on how long re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients have an­ti­bod­ies and are pro­tected from a sec­ond in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is try­ing to put his bout with the virus be­hind him, re­turn­ing to the cam­paign trail yes­ter­day to be­gin a three-week sprint to the Nov 3 election with a rally in the vi­tal bat­tle­ground state of Florida. The event, to be held at an air­port, will be his first rally since his pos­i­tive test for the virus.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent is seek­ing to change the dy­nam­ics of a race that polls show he is los­ing to Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den just three weeks be­fore election day.</p>
    <p>For months, Mr Trump had worked to shift at­ten­tion away from the virus and his han­dling of the pan­demic, which has in­fected 7.7 mil­lion peo­ple in the United States, killed more than 214,000 and put mil­lions out of work.</p>
    <p>But his own ill­ness has put the spot­light squarely on his coro­n­avirus re­sponse dur­ing the clos­ing stretch of the race.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den yes­ter­day vis­ited Ohio, a state Mr Trump won by 8 per­cent­age points in 2016. It is Mr Bi­den’s sec­ond cam­paign trip in as many weeks to Ohio, which was once thought out of reach but where polls now show a tight race.</p>
    <p>In Ohio, he will de­liver a speech in Toledo meant to un­der­mine what polls show is Mr Trump’s last great­est strength, the view among some vot­ers that the for­mer real es­tate en­tre­pre­neur is bet­ter on han­dling the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has pulled back his ad­ver­tis­ing in Ohio, while Mr Bi­den has in­creased his, an­other sign of the op­por­tu­nity the Democrats see to make more states com­pet­i­tive than they ini­tially imag­ined.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s rally in Florida, and planned ral­lies in Penn­syl­va­nia, Iowa and North Carolina this week, will be watched closely to see if the Pres­i­dent has changed tack in cam­paign­ing since con­tract­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>He has been crit­i­cised for fail­ing to en­cour­age sup­port­ers at cam­paign events, and even White House staff, to wear pro­tec­tive masks and abide by so­cial dis­tanc­ing guidelines. At least 11 close Trump aides have tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Asked last Satur­day if Mr Trump should be re­sum­ing ral­lies, Mr Bi­den said it was im­por­tant that he makes it clear to all those in at­ten­dance the im­por­tance of stay­ing so­cially dis­tanced and wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>“That’s the only re­spon­si­ble thing to do,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>Most re­cent polls in Florida, where a Trump loss would dra­mat­i­cally nar­row his path to re-election, show Mr Bi­den with a small lead.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump won Florida over Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Hil­lary Clin­ton in 2016 by just 1.2 per­cent­age points, which helped pro­pel him to the White House.</p>
    <p>This Tweet vi­o­lated the Twit­ter Rules about spread­ing mis­lead­ing and po­ten­tially harm­ful in­for­ma­tion re­lated to Covid-19.</p>
