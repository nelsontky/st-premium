    <p>Af­ter the Once Upon A Time on the Ori­ent Ex­press ex­hi­bi­tion made its de­but in Paris in 2014, there were plans to bring the show to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But the wheels were set in mo­tion only two years later. Along the way, the or­gan­is­ers had to deal with ad­min­is­tra­tive and cross-bor­der chal­lenges – and a global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This month, the Ori­ent Ex­press of France, the stuff of leg­end, fi­nally pulled into Sin­ga­pore and is sta­tioned at the West Lawn of Gar­dens by the Bay – its home for the next six months.</p>
    <p>More than 100 tonnes of the lo­co­mo­tive – with a car­riage for car­ry­ing fuel and wa­ter in tow and two ad­di­tional car­riages – left Paris on</p>
    <p>Nov 3 – mark­ing the first time the Ori­ent Ex­press car­riages are shipped over­seas in the train’s his­tory of more than 100 years.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion, a cul­mi­na­tion of talks since 2015 be­tween t he French and Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ments, opens to­day and runs till June 13.</p>
    <p>Be­lieved to be the largest of its kind in the world dur­ing the pan­demic, the show is ex­pected to at­tract at least 270,000 vis­i­tors. Af­ter Sin­ga­pore, it will travel to China, Egypt and Venice.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors will be greeted by an im­pos­ing 158-year-old green lo­co­mo­tive with an at­tached coal com­part­ment that helped steam-power the train, which l eft Paris on its maiden jour­ney on June 5, 1883, for Varna, Bul­garia.</p>
    <p>From there, pas­sen­gers head­ing to Con­stantino­ple (modern-day Is­tan­bul) in Turkey had to make the rest of their trip by ship.</p>
    <p>From June 1, 1889, the train started a direct route to Con­stantino­ple, which took four days and had stopovers at Mu­nich, Bu­dapest and Bel­grade.</p>
    <p>The trans-Euro­pean coal­guz­zling, steam-driven lo­co­mo­tives and lux­ury car­riages were cre­ated by Bel­gian civil en­gi­neer Ge­orges Nagel­mack­ers, who founded Com­pag­nie In­ter­na­tionale des Wagon­sLits, the com­pany which owned the orig­i­nal Ori­ent Ex­press trains.</p>
    <p>Mr Nagel­mack­ers, born into a fam­ily of bankers, hob­nobbed with Euro­pean roy­alty and the elite and de­signed the ul­tra-luxe trains for big spenders.</p>
    <p>In­side the pop-up tented ex­hi­bi­tion area here, which fea­tures a fa­cade styled to look like a 19th­cen­tury Parisian train sta­tion, there are over 2,000 sq m of ephemera.</p>
    <p>Two mas­sive blue-and-gold car­riages made of re­in­forced steel – a Pull­man made in 1920 and a Four­gon in 1929 – take cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>Their in­te­ri­ors fea­ture sump­tu­ous Art Deco mar­quetry by French fur­ni­ture de­signer and dec­o­ra­tor Rene Prou and ar­chi­tec­tural glass pan­els show­ing Bac­cha­na­lian maid­ens by renowned sculp­tor of crys­tal and glass Rene Lalique.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate replica of a din­ing car­riage, haute cui­sine will be served for lunch, din­ner, high tea and Sun­day brunch by three­Miche­lin-starred French chef Yan­nick Al­leno.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can check out a sprawl­ing mu­seum bou­tique and an Ori­ent Ex­press Road Cafe, which makes cof­fee brews from places along Ori­ent Ex­press routes such as Bagh­dad, Aleppo and Cairo.</p>
    <p>STEEPED IN HIS­TORY</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal Ori­ent Ex­press route in 1883 was from Paris across Europe through Stras­bourg, Mu­nich, Vi­enna, Bu­dapest and Bucharest be­fore end­ing in Con­stantino­ple.</p>
    <p>Its sis­ter train, the Sim­plon Ori­ent Ex­press, also trav­elled a route from Paris to Is­tan­bul, but headed south through Lausanne, Sim­plon, Mi­lan, Venice, Bel­grade and Sofia be­fore ar­riv­ing in Is­tan­bul.</p>
    <p>The Ori­ent Ex­press has seen its fair share of his­tory.</p>
    <p>Apart from in­spir­ing lit­er­ary works such as Gra­ham Greene’s Stam­boul Train (1932) and Agatha Christie’s Mur­der On The Ori­ent Ex­press (1934), it has also been in­volved in cross-bor­der ten­sions and was even blown up by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.</p>
    <p>By 1977, the orig­i­nal Ori­ent Ex­press routes were re­tired af­ter more than 100 years of sto­ried jour­neys. In 1982, the Venice Sim­plon Ori­ent Ex­press started re­trac­ing the orig­i­nal Ori­ent Ex­press route and con­tin­ues the ser­vice till to­day.</p>
    <p>SIX-YEAR JOUR­NEY TO SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion was first held in 2014 in Paris in the court­yard of the In­sti­tut du Monde Arabe (IMA), or the Arab World In­sti­tute. It fea­tured a lo­co­mo­tive and three car­riages and drew more than 250,000 vis­i­tors over four months.</p>
    <p>IMA, a foun­da­tion set up to pro­mote Arab cul­ture in 1981, is coowned by the French gov­ern­ment and 22 Arab coun­tries that are mem­bers of the Arab League. It is also one of the or­gan­is­ers of the Sin­ga­pore show.</p>
    <p>Other or­gan­is­ers in­clude IMA pres­i­dent Jack Lang, 81; the ex­hi­bi­tion’s gen­eral com­mis­sioner Claude Mol­lard, 79; Ori­ent Ex­press Com­pany vice-pres­i­dent Guil­laume de Saint Lager, 36; and artist and ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Ly­die Blan­deau, who is in her 40s.</p>
    <p>Mr Mol­lard tells The Straits Times the French or­gan­is­ers had tried to bring the ex­hi­bi­tion here af­ter its Paris de­but.</p>
    <p>“At that time, Ms Blan­deau was al­ready in Sin­ga­pore,” says the French arts ad­min­is­tra­tor and au­thor. “The then Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Lawrence Wong in­vited Mr Lang and my­self. From there, the idea of or­gan­is­ing the ex­hi­bi­tion here sprang up.”</p>
    <p>It was not un­til last year that the or­gan­is­ing team helmed by</p>
    <p>Ms Blan­deau fast-tracked the project af­ter the key pieces – a lo­co­mo­tive and ten­der con­structed in 1862 and two car­riages – were se­cured for the ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>She worked with Gar­dens by the Bay, Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board and the French Ministry of Cul­ture to iron out the ad­min­is­tra­tive kinks.</p>
    <p>The owner of Vi­sion­airs Gallery Asia, an art gallery in Capi­tol Pi­azza, says: “Since 2016, we have been fac­ing many stops and chal­lenges, but isn’t this the pur­pose of a train? Stop­ping at a sta­tion be­fore mov­ing again.</p>
    <p>“It be­came more chal­leng­ing with the pan­demic. Against all odds, the team pulled through to present an ex­hi­bi­tion linked to travel, cul­ture and gas­tron­omy. I hope Sin­ga­pore­ans love it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Felix Loh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Gar­dens by the Bay, says Covid-19 pre­sented an es­pe­cially tough chal­lenge for the transcon­ti­nen­tal project at a time when i nter­na­tional bor­ders re­main closed.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing seen the ex­hi­bi­tion take shape in the Gar­dens over the past few months – from the ar­rival of the lo­co­mo­tive and car­riages to the re­cre­ation of the sta­tion – I have no doubt this ex­tra­or­di­nary show­case will bring much de­light to lo­cal vis­i­tors,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Mr de Saint Lager says the train, a na­tional trea­sure of France, formed a sym­bol and bridge be­tween the Western and East­ern worlds. “This dream of go­ing ever fur­ther in the East was re­ally the dream of Mr Nagel­mack­ers,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“He also opened a chain of ho­tels around the world and one of the ho­tels was in Asia.</p>
    <p>“To me, it is very sym­bolic to have this first ex­hi­bi­tion hap­pen in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
