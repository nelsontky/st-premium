    <p>As North Amer­i­can movie the­atres strug­gle to re­turn to nor­malcy dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the first ma­jor Hol­ly­wood re­lease in six months, di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan’s Tenet, has taken in US$20.2 mil­lion (S$27.6 mil­lion) in five days.</p>
    <p>In nor­mal times, that sort of num­ber for an ex­pected block­buster would be wor­ri­some for Warner Bros Pic­tures, its distributo­r.</p>
    <p>With a pro­duc­tion bud­get of US$200 mil­lion, the film’s early roll­out rep­re­sented a ma­jor gam­ble for the stu­dio.</p>
    <p>“Do­mes­ti­cally, Tenet de­buted at the lower end of ex­pec­ta­tions – US$20m through Mon­day,” in­dus­try watcher Ex­hibitor Re­la­tions said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>But the re­lease comes i n the Covid-19 world – with many cin­e­mas still closed or op­er­at­ing at re­duced ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The United States re­lease hopes to cap­i­talise on the i mpor­tant Labour Day week­end, with the hol­i­day fall­ing on yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There is lit­er­ally no con­text in which to com­pare the re­sults of a film open­ing dur­ing a pan­demic with any other cir­cum­stance,” Warner Bros said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Tenet, a clever block­buster that slips be­tween es­pi­onage and sci­ence fic­tion, went on gen­eral re­lease last Wed­nes­day, with hopes of en­tic­ing au­di­ences back to the cin­e­mas af­ter months of clo­sure.</p>
    <p>The film has done bet­ter overseas, where the­atres are fur­ther along in the re­open­ing process, Hol­ly­wood Reporter said. It has taken in close to US$150 mil­lion glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sev­eral post­pone­ments, the film has be­come the first of its kind to dare a re­lease dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Dis­ney canned its plan for a big-screen re­lease of Mu­lan, pre­fer­ring in­stead to run it on dig­i­tal plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The lat­est James Bond film, No Time To Die, which was due for re­lease in April, was also post­poned and will now go into cin­e­mas in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>But Warner Bros has put con­fi­dence – based on past per­for­mance – in Nolan’s abil­ity to pull in the crowds.</p>
    <p>His re­boot­ing of the Bat­man films in the shape of the Dark Knight tril­ogy (2005 to 2012) has grossed more than US$4 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Tenet was re­leased in more than 70 coun­tries, i nclud­ing most of Europe, Canada, Aus­tralia, South Korea and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The film ap­pears to be a straight­for­ward spy movie with a se­cret agent (John David Wash­ing­ton) on the heels of an evil oli­garch (Ken­neth Branagh) who is threat­en­ing hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>But in true Nolan style, there is a twist – no­tably, that char­ac­ters can re­verse time. Tenet, with a cast that in­cludes Robert Pat­tin­son and El­iz­a­beth De­bicki, was shot in seven coun­tries.</p>
