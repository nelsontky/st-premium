    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, cross-ex­am­ined The On­line Ci­ti­zen ed­i­tor Terry Xu yes­ter­day. Here is an edited ex­cerpt.</p>
    <p>SC Singh: When you gave ev­i­dence to Her Hon­our ear­lier, you mis­led Her Hon­our by giv­ing her the im­pres­sion that you were care­ful not to ag­gra­vate mat­ters. Not to call the plain­tiff (PM Lee) a bully. But here, just a few days af­ter the post we talked about, you called the ac­tion “un­called-for in­tim­i­da­tion, es­pe­cially when it is from a pub­lic ser­vant”. So my ques­tion is, you lied ear­lier, when you claimed you did not want to ag­gra­vate mat­ters, you agree?</p>
    <p>Mr Xu: Dis­agree.</p>
    <p>SC Singh: You were so an­gry with the plain­tiff that you used the me­dia, you had to at­tack him.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu: Dis­agree.</p>
    <p>SC Singh: In fact, you made such a se­ri­ous at­tack by say­ing that a pub­lic ser­vant had in­tim­i­dated you... Doesn’t that show the amount of venom you had for the plain­tiff and how much you wanted to dam­age him?</p>
    <p>Mr Xu: If I were to agree, it would have been the amount of venom I had for the plain­tiff’s ac­tion.</p>
    <p>SC Singh: You had venom for the plain­tiff’s ac­tion? Are you say­ing that if a party pre­sumes to sue you, that party de­serves these kinds of al­le­ga­tions be­ing made in pub­lic against him? Is that what you’re telling us?</p>
    <p>Mr Xu: If a pub­lic ser­vant does what he does, I would say yes, he does.</p>
    <p>SC Singh: You wanted to stir and gen­er­ate ha­tred and con­tempt for the plain­tiff, cor­rect?</p>
    <p>Mr Xu:</p>
    <p>I dis­agree.</p>
    <p>SC Singh: Re­ally? Putting it on Face­book, which you know in­vites com­ments, shares, re­ac­tions, you didn’t think that, or that wasn’t your in­ten­tion?</p>
    <p>Mr Xu: You said I wanted to stir and gen­er­ate ha­tred and con­tempt. No. I wanted peo­ple to know.</p>
    <p>SC Singh: You al­ready told them about the suit, but now you were go­ing be­yond that, you were mak­ing an al­le­ga­tion against him.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu: What’s the al­le­ga­tion?</p>
    <p>SC Singh: Is the al­le­ga­tion that a pub­lic ser­vant has in­tim­i­dated some­one a se­ri­ous al­le­ga­tion?</p>
    <p>Mr Xu: Yes, but my point in my com­ment was say­ing that I’m be­ing in­tim­i­dated by a pub­lic ser­vant.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Au­drey Lim: So you are say­ing that a pub­lic ser­vant has in­tim­i­dated you?</p>
    <p>Mr Xu: Yes, Your Hon­our.</p>
