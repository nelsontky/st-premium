    <p>Re­tired Tai­wanese ac­tress Brigitte Lin Ching-hsia is back on Weibo for the first time in six years – and she lost no time in up­dat­ing fans on her life.</p>
    <p>Lin is still fondly re­mem­bered by many even though she quit act­ing after mar­ry­ing Hong Kong busi­ness­man Michael Ying in 1994.</p>
    <p>She has two daugh­ters with Mr Ying, 70, and a step­daugh­ter from his pre­vi­ous mar­riage.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress is known for roles in movies such as Red Dust (1990), Swords­man II (1992) and The Bride With White Hair (1993).</p>
    <p>Lin set up her Weibo ac­count nine years ago and had posted up­dates oc­ca­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she went silent on so­cial me­dia after Christ­mas Day in 2014, in which she shared a post about her be­ing on the cover of Elle mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>The screen leg­end sur­prised her fol­low­ers on Weibo at 11.55pm on Mon­day when she wrote: “It’s ac­ces­si­ble. Hello, ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Lin, who turned 66 on Nov 3, wrote that the birth­day gift she gave her­self this year was her new book, whose Chi­nese ti­tle trans­lates to In Front And Be­hind The Mir­ror.</p>
    <p>She told fans that her new book was a record of what she thought, heard, saw and did in the last six years.</p>
    <p>She has writ­ten two other books – In­side And Out­side The Win­dow in 2011 and Cloud To Cloud in 2014.</p>
    <p>There have been ru­mours that her mar­riage was on the rocks. She seemed to be re­fut­ing them when she re­counted what her hus­band told their three daugh­ters after she had com­pleted her third book.</p>
    <p>“My hus­band Michael smiled and said to my three daugh­ters, ‘Your mum may win a No­bel Lit­er­a­ture Prize soon after writ­ing three books.’”</p>
    <p>Lin said she was very happy with what he said even though she knew it was said in jest.</p>
    <p>The screen leg­end also posted a re­cent photo of her­self and shared some in­sights into her life.</p>
    <p>She ex­er­cises, reads and writes every day dur­ing the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She sur­prised her fans fur­ther with a photo of her younger self, likely taken in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>She then posted a pic­ture of her dress­ing ta­ble, which was stacked full of books.</p>
    <p>“It is con­ve­nient to grab a book when you want to read it in bed as they are within reach,” she joked.</p>
    <p>She has writ­ten 12 posts so far in less than two days.</p>
