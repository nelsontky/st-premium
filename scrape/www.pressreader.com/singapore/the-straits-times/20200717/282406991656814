    <p>Fash­ion vet­er­ans have com­mented that the lux­ury world is largely pan­demic-proof, that the coro­n­avirus is a mere blip in the time­line for many of the decades­old houses.</p>
    <p>Like many lux­ury la­bels with a pres­ence i n Sin­ga­pore, French fash­ion house Ce­line prefers not to com­ment on the pan­demic’s im­pact on busi­ness. But it does have a gleam­ing re­vamped dou­ble­storey flag­ship store at The Shoppes at Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS).</p>
    <p>The store had a bit of a false start, though. Af­ter a six-month over­haul, it opened on April 1, but closed within a week to com­ply with cir­cuit breaker mea­sures that took ef­fect on April 7.</p>
    <p>The shiny 316 sq m du­plex, the mai­son’s largest store in South-east Asia, sat empty for more than two months be­fore it re­opened again on June 19, when phase two kicked in.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the bou­tique of­fered clients a “dis­tant-sell­ing ser­vice” in which cus­tomers could com­mu­ni­cate with Ce­line’s re­tail team, buy re­motely and have the items de­liv­ered to their doorstep.</p>
    <p>The house, which has an­other store in Ngee Ann City, de­clined to com­ment on the clo­sure.</p>
    <p>The ex­panded flag­ship was hotly an­tic­i­pated among the fash­ion com­mu­nity for a few rea­sons.</p>
    <p>First, be­cause it would launch the la­bel’s menswear line and the Haute Par­fumerie col­lec­tion i n Sin­ga­pore for the first time.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the global store revamp is the first un­der­taken by cre­ative di­rec­tor Hedi Sli­mane, who joined Ce­line in 2018.</p>
    <p>Many had an­tic­i­pated a re­fresh of the brand’s vis­ual iden­tity un­der a new cre­ative mind.</p>
    <p>De­signed with a “re­fined 21st cen­tury” bru­tal­ist aes­thetic, the MBS store’s in­te­rior mir­rors Sli­mane’s pen­chant for grungy, glam-rock min­i­mal­ism.</p>
    <p>Nat­u­ral ma­te­ri­als and stones – basaltina, black gran­ite, an­tique mar­ble and grey traver­tine – are paired with mod­ern fin­ish­ings such as re­claimed oak, stain­less steel, brass and gold mir­rors.</p>
    <p>His in­ten­tion was to cre­ate “for­mal ten­sion” with the ar­chi­tec­ture and sub­se­quent “har­mony and a sense of in­ti­macy”, Sli­mane, 52, told The Straits Times in an ex­clu­sive e-mail in­ter­view in April. It was the first time he had spo­ken to the me­dia in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways aim for a store con­cept that is si­mul­ta­ne­ously cold yet warm, ar­chi­tec­tural yet or­ganic,” the French­man added.</p>
    <p>“My aes­thetic is all about the pre­cise bal­ance and har­mony be­tween an ethe­real min­i­mal space and the decor specif­i­cally cho­sen for each store world­wide.”</p>
    <p>Each of the 178 Ce­line stores around the world is unique. Sli­mane first rolled out the new re­tail con­cept – which many have de­scribed as re­sem­bling an art gallery for the pieces – in New York City in Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>At the city’s store in Madi­son Av­enue, mas­sive struc­tural col­umns com­ple­ment a cen­tre­piece sculp­ture by Bri­tish artist James Balm­forth, which fea­tures stacked blocks of stain­less steel and rock.</p>
    <p>A branch in Paris takes on a more homey vibe, with a read­ing cor­ner dressed with sculp­tural arm­chairs and book­shelves.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the con­cept leans to­wards an­gu­lar­ity, lines and sym­me­try. Floor tiles line up per­fectly with the walls, each slab of basaltina (sourced from a quarry) cut and laid to en­sure a con­ti­nu­ity of lines through­out the space.</p>
    <p>“All my Ce­line stores are de­signed in re­la­tion to their lo­ca­tion. The lo­cal cul­ture forms the essence of each project, with the in­ten­tion of cre­at­ing a dia­logue be­tween two tra­di­tions,” Sli­mane said.</p>
    <p>“For the MBS flag­ship, I ex­per­i­mented with new pieces of fur­ni­ture and leather chairs within a sort of laid­back 1970s French tra­di­tion.”</p>
    <p>Each store boasts cu­rated mini li­braries and site-spe­cific art­works cu­rated by Sli­mane.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing no­to­ri­ously tightlippe­d to the press – or per­haps be­cause of it – the elu­sive de­signer has had a fairly con­tro­ver­sial run since tak­ing on the man­tle at Ce­line.</p>
    <p>Once his foot was in the door, he dropped the ac­cent from the la­bel’s logo, mark­ing the start of a brand revamp that quickly di­vided fans. Many noted a clear shift in the fash­ion de­sign, away from the un­der­stated pal­ette of for­mer cre­ative di­rec­tor Phoebe Philo, who is Bri­tish, to­wards a more in­die-rock vibe.</p>
    <p>Sli­mane, who was artis­tic di­rec­tor at Yves Saint Lau­rent from 2012 to 2016, had said in pre­vi­ous in­ter­views that the new Ce­line is rooted in, or is a re­turn to, a French mind­set.</p>
    <p>“It’s a style that comes quite nat­u­rally, re­ally, be­cause this is the core of who I am. In Paris, very few cou­ture houses are in the hands of true Parisians. The un­der­stand­ing of that par­tic­u­lar young woman or man, of that Parisian al­lure, is in­tu­itive,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>“To­day, Ce­line rep­re­sents that light-hearted Parisian at­ti­tude and taste. There is also a trans­po­si­tion into our con­tem­po­rary world of a kind of 1960s and 1970s Parisian at­mos­phere.”</p>
    <p>The cur­rent ready-to-wear col­lec­tion was in­spired by the French bour­geoisie of the 1970s, as will fu­ture col­lec­tions. In line with his con­cept of jux­ta­po­si­tion, softer sil­hou­ettes such as ruf­fles and printed maxi dresses stand in sharp con­trast to the store’s rather aus­tere de­sign.</p>
    <p>When asked how that might trans­late to his Asian con­sumers in a glob­alised world, Sli­mane, who de­clined to com­ment on the pan­demic, hinted that it would not.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing must make sense, with­out any pre­tence or pos­ing and, most im­por­tantly, it must be rel­e­vant to (my client’s) life and every­day ex­is­tence,” he said.</p>
    <p>“For my Asian clients, I want to keep in­tact that form of light­ness, en­thu­si­asm and care­free­ness so es­sen­tial to all my fash­ion cre­ations.”</p>
    <p>My aes­thetic is all about the pre­cise bal­ance and har­mony be­tween an ethe­real min­i­mal space and the decor specif­i­cally cho­sen for each store world­wide. ’’</p>
