    <p>Dur­ing the shut-in pe­riod of the coro­n­avirus, go­ing out­doors was a rare, care­fully ap­por­tioned treat.</p>
    <p>In the past few months, af­ter the end of the cir­cuit breaker, some Covid-19 re­stric­tions have been re­laxed.</p>
    <p>Crowds have been ob­served swarm­ing parts of the beach at East Coast Park, with many in groups of more than five, with­out proper safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>With hun­dreds of parks in Sin­ga­pore – Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) alone man­ages more than 350 – there is no need to throng pop­u­lar na­ture spots like MacRitchie Reser­voir Park.</p>
    <p>Other less known and less crowded green spa­ces can equally serve a va­ri­ety of in­ter­ests, whether it is jog­ging, hik­ing, bird-spot­ting or a lovers’ stroll.</p>
    <p>Ad­vo­cates of the re­gen­er­a­tive power of na­ture some­times speak about the calm that de­scends when they feel con­nected with the earth.</p>
    <p>This may be found in the tran­quil­lity of a well-kept gar­den, in the mys­ti­cal quiet of a for­est or the re­flec­tive calm of the sea.</p>
    <p>Here is a se­lec­tion of seven un­der-the-radar parks to re­store your equa­nim­ity.</p>
    <p>ve­nes­sal@sph.com.sg</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>Up­per Sele­tar Reser­voir Park</p>
    <p>Rec­om­mended for:</p>
    <p>In­sta­gram­mers</p>
    <p>Up­per Sele­tar Reser­voir Park is a blast from the past. The Sele­tar Reser­voir was built in 1920 and of­fi­cially opened in 1969 by a cousin of Queen El­iz­a­beth II, Princess Alexan­dra, The Hon­ourable Lady Ogilvy, who is now 83.</p>
    <p>Get an In­sta­grammable up­date to the present by post­ing pho­tos of the park’s retro, rocket-shaped look­out tower, which was built to re­flect the global in­ter­est in space ex­plo­ration in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Hu­mans look like mites stand­ing next to the park’s her­itage trees, like the Kapok tree, which can grow to about 40m tall.</p>
    <p>Bonus points if you man­age to catch wildlife within the frame.</p>
    <p>A fam­ily of wild boars, with ba­bies in tow, skit­tered away be­fore I could get my phone out, leav­ing only patches of up­rooted mud, where they had been for­ag­ing for grubs and worms.</p>
    <p>Lo­ca­tion: Along Mandai Road Track 7, off Mandai Road. Di­rec­tions can be found on the NParks web­site (www.nparks.gov.sg).</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Wood­lands Water­front Park</p>
    <p>Rec­om­mended for: Sea lovers</p>
    <p>The jetty is the star at Wood­lands Water­front Park. A con­tented buzz set­tles in the evening as men kick back with their fish­ing rods and kids do stunts on their bikes along its L-shaped, 400m length.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the day, mon­i­tor lizards and ot­ters can be spot­ted swim­ming in the Strait of Jo­hor. For those crav­ing travel and far­away vis­tas, this jetty on our north­ern shore of­fers an un­tram­melled view of Jo­hor Baru, the Cause­way and the wide and open Strait.</p>
    <p>Ms Jeyas­ree Chan­draku­maran, 20, and Ms Far­reen Naaz, 19, are friends who have trav­elled a long way to hang out at the jetty, from their homes in Ang Mo Kio and Tampines, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Ms Far­reen, a Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts stu­dent, says: “It’s less crowded than in some other parks. The rip­pling wa­ter is calm­ing. I feel so re­laxed and light.”</p>
    <p>Gaz­ing across the Strait, I feel a pang of long­ing for the places I had been when I last vis­ited Jo­hor Baru a few years back. Covid-19 and its clos­ing up of the world has made me sen­ti­men­tal.</p>
    <p>The noise and del­uge of mo­tor­cy­cles and cars from Malaysia have ceased dur­ing the pan­demic. The sun­set gives a fi­nal gasp of bril­liance be­fore night falls, turn­ing the sky apri­cot. Lo­ca­tion: Ad­mi­ralty Road West</p>
    <p>3 Mar­sil­ing Park</p>
    <p>Rec­om­mended for: Gar­den­ing en­thu­si­asts</p>
    <p>Mar­sil­ing Park is a dif­fer­ent beast from panoramic Wood­lands Water­front Park, which is a stone’s throw away. Even though its western edge is made up of man­groves, Mar­sil­ing Park is mostly man­i­cured and dainty.</p>
    <p>A play­ground in the shape of a but­ter­fly, with a series of climb­ing ropes, is one of its kind in Sin­ga­pore. It sits amid lan­tana and other plants that at­tract but­ter­flies. A fit­ness cor­ner has equip­ment that pow­ers and charges your mo­bile phone when you plug it in as you ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre­piece stone bridge, which dates back to the 1980s when the park was first built, is flanked by Chi­nese pavil­ions. It is a fa­mil­iar set­ting for lo­cal Chi­nese pe­riod dra­mas, which have been filmed here.</p>
    <p>For­merly known as Wood­lands Town Gar­den, this 12.8ha park is a sooth­ing in­ter­lude if you want to take a breather. It is pret­ti­est at night, when it is all lit up.</p>
    <p>Lo­ca­tion: Wood­lands Cen­tre Road, next to Bukit Timah Ex­press­way</p>
    <p>4 Ja­panese Ceme­tery Park</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese Ceme­tery Park, with its or­derly rows of graves, is a tidy doc­u­ment of his­tory.</p>
    <p>About 900 tomb­stones can be found in this park in a quiet Hougang neigh­bour­hood, which is said to be the largest Ja­panese ceme­tery in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished in 1891 and closed to buri­als in 1973, the memo­ri­als and in­for­ma­tion pan­els here pro­vide a glimpse of a pre-World War II com­mu­nity un­known to many.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese busi­ness­men, pros­ti­tutes and sol­diers are among those laid to rest here.</p>
    <p>In the early years, three brothel keep­ers gained of­fi­cial ap­proval for a ceme­tery for Ja­panese pros­ti­tutes who died in poverty in Sin­ga­pore. Nearly half of the tomb­stones here be­long to these karayuki-san (mean­ing “women who have gone over­seas”), who made up a large sec­tion of the Ja­panese pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore up to the 1890s.</p>
    <p>The re­mains of the first Ja­panese res­i­dent in Sin­ga­pore, Oto­kichi</p>
    <p>Ya­mamoto (1817 – 1867), a sailor who helped to trans­late por­tions of the Bi­ble into Ja­panese, are also buried here.</p>
    <p>Sen­si­tiv­i­ties sur­round­ing the war dead from the Ja­panese</p>
    <p>Oc­cu­pa­tion, some of whom were in­terred here, pos­si­bly con­trib­ute to the ceme­tery’s low-key pres­ence.</p>
    <p>The coos of pi­geons seem louder than usual in this quiet, dig­ni­fied space, which mea­sures</p>
    <p>30,000 sq m. Tun­nel-like arch­ways, burst­ing with pink bougainvil­lea, criss-cross the ceme­tery, where a king­fisher flits among the grave­stones.</p>
    <p>Lo­ca­tion: 22 Chuan Hoe Av­enue</p>
    <p>5 Tampines Eco Green</p>
    <p>Some­thing is hov­er­ing nearby, whirring so fast it looks like a dark blot in the air. Smaller than a spar­row, it drones louder than a bee.</p>
    <p>Na­ture guide An­drew Tay, 56, iden­ti­fies the per­fectly named hum­ming­bird hawk moth, which looks like both bird and moth, when it comes to rest briefly on a bush.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay, a na­ture ed­u­ca­tor at non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Ci­cada Tree Eco-Place, is teach­ing me the im­por­tance of names at Tampines Eco Green.</p>
    <p>Know­ing that a bird which sports a red­dish chest and what looks like a black mut­ton-chop mous­tache is called a red-breasted para­keet some­how trans­forms its pret­ti­ness into beauty.</p>
    <p>I use school­girl terms like “that green bird” and “this yel­low but­ter­fly” but I now want more. I re­solve to dust off the na­ture books on my shelf at home.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Mr Tay reels off the names of the fauna and flora like the names of his friends. He points out the or­ange blad­der cherry with pa­pery leaves, which grows wild here and which of­ten adorns store-bought birthday cakes.</p>
    <p>He iden­ti­fies a Club Sil­ver­line but­ter­fly, a rare, striped looker that has had part of its wings torn off, pos­si­bly by a hun­gry bird.</p>
    <p>Brim­ming with 75 species of birds and 55 species of but­ter­flies and drag­on­flies, Tampines Eco Green presents many un­com­mon vis­tas.</p>
    <p>Dusk be­stows a soft glow on wood­land ar­eas that look like they sprang from Eng­land.</p>
    <p>The green-fringed ponds are Pre-Raphaelite scenes where one imag­ines artists paint­ing Ophe­lia drown­ing. (Hap­pily, there are no such Shake­spearean dra­mas here.) The long-grassed marshes look al­most like a sa­van­nah out of Africa, as the NParks web­site de­scribes.</p>
    <p>Logs dou­ble as benches in this eco­log­i­cally con­scious park, which has a wa­ter-less eco-toi­let, the first of its kind in a pub­lic park. It con­verts hu­man waste into com­post us­ing bac­te­ria and wood shav­ings. The great­est marvel is how the loo is odour-free.</p>
    <p>I get a jolt when I emerge from this 36.5ha park. The MRT tracks are just me­tres away, but I have been trans­ported be­yond traf­fic and trains.</p>
    <p>Lo­ca­tion: Tampines Av­enue 9 and Tampines Av­enue 12.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tions: From Tampines MRT sta­tion, walk 20 min­utes to the park via Sun Plaza Park.</p>
    <p>6 Chest­nut Na­ture Park</p>
    <p>A long walk in Chest­nut Na­ture Park can be pleas­ingly cool, even in Sin­ga­pore’s dog day af­ter­noons.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary for­est, with tall trees of­fer­ing plenty of shade, cov­ers much of Sin­ga­pore’s largest na­ture park, which has two ar­eas to­talling 81ha – Chest­nut Na­ture Park (South) and Chest­nut Na­ture Park (North).</p>
    <p>Cycling en­thu­si­asts get sep­a­rate moun­tain bik­ing trails. Bikes can be rented and washed at a kiosk at the en­trance of the park, which also sells snacks and drinks.</p>
    <p>An el­derly man, with an over­sized, pad­dle-shaped flash dif­fuser at­tached to his cam­era, is peer­ing at the dense fo­liage and tak­ing macro-pho­to­graphs – close-up pho­to­graphs of tiny sub­jects like in­sects.</p>
    <p>An­i­mals like the blue Malayan co­ral snake, beau­ti­ful and ven­omous, and the shy, big-eyed Malayan colugo can be found in the park, which bor­ders the species-rich Cen­tral Catch­ment Na­ture Re­serve.</p>
    <p>Lo­ca­tion:</p>
    <p>Sit­u­ated along Chest­nut Av­enue, Chest­nut Na­ture Park stretches along Bukit Timah</p>
    <p>Ex­press­way (BKE) from Gali Batu Fly­over to Dairy Farm Fly­over. Di­rec­tions via bus, MRT and car can be found at the NParks web­site.</p>
    <p>7 Lower Peirce Trail</p>
    <p>A fam­ily-friendly stroll along the Lower Peirce Trail yields bet­ter than ex­pected re­turns.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Chan, 26, the founder of The Un­tamed Paths, which of­fers wildlife tours in Sin­ga­pore, says: “It’s a short walk that is un­der-rated. A lot of peo­ple don’t think they can see much here, but it’s sim­i­lar to what one would find in a na­ture re­serve.”</p>
    <p>Along a 900m series of board­walks, which most chil­dren and se­niors can nav­i­gate, Mr Chan points out for­est res­i­dents like a chest­nut-bel­lied malkoha, an un­com­mon blue-grey cuckoo that looks like it has dabbed red eye­shadow all around its eyes.</p>
    <p>The long-tailed macaques, which some­times prowl the carpark just out­side the forested area near a pop­u­lar prata eatery, Ca­sua­r­ina Curry, are close enough that I can make out their ex­pres­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan has seen other pri­mates like the Raf­fles’ banded lan­gur, a threat­ened species, high up in the canopy along the trail.</p>
    <p>The for­est is filled with am­bi­ent sounds like the trick­ling of a stream and the croak­ing of frogs.</p>
    <p>Yet the over­all im­pres­sion is a grand canopy of si­lence, with dart­ing shad­ows of crea­tures un­seen un­til they are ready to re­veal them­selves.</p>
    <p>Lo­ca­tion: Start your walk along Old Up­per Thom­son Road at the Ca­sua­r­ina En­trance.</p>
