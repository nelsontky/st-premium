    <p>Tai­wanese singer-host Alien Huang may have died from car­dio­vas­cu­lar com­pli­ca­tions on Sept 16, but his good friends have not for­got­ten his birth­day.</p>
    <p>He would have turned 37 last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>His good friend and for­mer girl­friend, singer Rainie Yang, posted on In­sta­gram a com­pos­ite photo of her with Huang, ac­tress Ann Hsu, Ms Elin Yeh and an­other friend who goes by the on­line name Beach­boi. The five good friends are known as the Hwa Kang Gang of Five as they were grad­u­ates of the Taipei Hwa Kang Arts School.</p>
    <p>Yang, 36, wrote i n Chi­nese: “Happy birth­day. I will not post wishes on your birth­day in fu­ture. I will choose to say it in my heart, as you know I al­ways re­mem­ber this day.</p>
    <p>“The five of us should have taken a photo to­gether some time ago, but did not act on it even though we have talked about it for a long time. I never imag­ined that the photo would be pre­sented this way.</p>
    <p>“Although we talked and laughed the day the photo was taken, we knew how we felt in our hearts.”</p>
    <p>She thanked Huang’s man­ager Dino for pro­vid­ing Huang’s photo and the staff who took the group photo and then in­serted the singer-host into it.</p>
    <p>Huang’s girl­friend – cheer­leader Wu Han-chun – did not for­get his birth­day ei­ther, as she posted on so­cial me­dia the cake she had made for him last year and thanked him for ap­pear­ing in her life.</p>
    <p>For in­flu­encer Bella Su, it has been one year since her boyfriend, model-ac­tor God­frey Gao, died.</p>
    <p>He died at age 35 of sud­den car­diac ar­rest on Nov 27 last year af­ter col­laps­ing dur­ing the shoot­ing of Chi­nese re­al­ity show Chase Me in Zhe­jiang, China.</p>
    <p>Su wrote a long post on so­cial me­dia, de­tail­ing the tur­moil she had gone through in the past year, in­clud­ing her sad­ness at los­ing her boyfriend and the crit­i­cism she faced on­line when­ever she posted photos to re­mem­ber Gao, with some ne­ti­zens ac­cus­ing her of ex­ploit­ing his death.</p>
    <p>The in­flu­encer said she was for­tu­nate that she had met some life men­tors to guide her along the way.</p>
    <p>Gao’s other good friends also re­mem­bered him on his first death an­niver­sary, with for­mer F4 mem­ber Van Ness Wu, ac­tor Gabriel Lan, singer K.Swo and singer Cindy Yen ded­i­cat­ing their new song Through It All to him.</p>
