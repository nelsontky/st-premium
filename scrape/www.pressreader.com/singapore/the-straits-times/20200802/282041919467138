    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • After not play­ing a com­pet­i­tive Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion game since March and ar­riv­ing late for train­ing camp be­cause of a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test, Fri­day was a test of Rus­sell West­brook’s phys­i­cal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Not only were his team, the Houston Rock­ets, pushed to their lim­its at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Com­plex in Dis­ney World, but also their op­po­nents, the Dal­las Mav­er­icks, threat­ened to over-run them in the first two quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Their cross-town ri­vals scored a season-high 85 points by the first half, but their lead was only 10 points, with West­brook and James Har­den keep­ing Houston in the game.</p>
    <p>They had scored a total of 43 points at that point and moved up a gear after the break, con­tribut­ing an over­all 31 points and 49 points re­spec­tively, ral­ly­ing for a 153-149 over­time win.</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets (41-24) claimed the season se­ries with Dal­las (40-28) two games to one by fi­nally mus­ter­ing some de­fen­sive might down the stretch of the fourth quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Trail­ing 139-137, Houston got a tip-in off a Har­den-missed free throw from Robert Cov­ing­ton with 3.3 sec­onds left to force over­time, and Dal­las’ Luka Don­cic fouled out via an of­fen­sive foul with 28.3sec left, his ab­sence at the end was enough to give Houston the win.</p>
    <p>West­brook later told ESPN he had to dig deep, with the 2017 Most Valu­able Player (MVP) ad­mit­ting he was slightly be­hind in fit­ness due to his Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s tough,” the guard, who also had 11 re­bounds and eight as­sists, said. “To be at home for 18, 19 days, no work­ing out... (I) was a lit­tle slow tonight but I’ll def­i­nitely be bet­ter mov­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>“We willed our way to that win. We went and took that game. They thought they had it, and we went and took it away.”</p>
    <p>Har­den agreed the Rock­ets had shown their met­tle ahead of the play-offs later this month.</p>
    <p>“Our con­fi­dence de­fen­sively was build­ing, es­pe­cially in that fourth quar­ter,” the 2018 MVP, who added nine re­bounds and eight as­sists, said. “We kept push­ing the tempo, kept fight­ing. We kept telling our­selves that we’re built for it. We’re going to play four quar­ters. We have legs to be able to push through men­tal tough­ness.”</p>
    <p>The Mav­er­icks, how­ever, were left to rue a spec­tac­u­lar fail­ure de­spite vic­tory seem­ingly in their hands.</p>
    <p>Kristaps Porzingis paced Dal­las with 39 points and 16 re­bounds, while Don­cic recorded a league­lead­ing 15th triple-dou­ble of the season with 28 points, 13 re­bounds and 10 as­sists.</p>
    <p>Yet their of­fen­sive spurt was not enough to get them over the line, lead­ing the team to do some soulsearch­ing after­wards, as they bid to earn a post-season berth for the first time since the 2015-16 season.</p>
    <p>“This is a tough loss,” Dal­las coach Rick Carlisle said. “This is about as tough as it gets, and it just comes down to ba­sic ex­e­cu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Don­cic added: “We’re a young team. We’ve got a lot to learn. We’ll get bet­ter for sure. I know we’re going to get to­gether when it mat­ters most, so I’m not wor­ried about that.”</p>
    <p>In the other key game of the day, reign­ing MVP Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo scored 36 points as the league-lead­ing Mil­wau­kee Bucks (54-12) de­feated the Bos­ton Celtics 119-112 in their first game since the season was shut down in March ow­ing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>THINGS WILL IM­PROVE</p>
    <p>It’s tough. To be at home for 18, 19 days, no work­ing out... (I) was a lit­tle slow tonight but I’ll def­i­nitely be bet­ter mov­ing for­ward. ’’</p>
