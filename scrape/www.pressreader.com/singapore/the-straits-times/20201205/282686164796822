    <p>The world’s top Mo­bile Leg­ends: Bang Bang (MLBB) play­ers will set foot in Sin­ga­pore from Jan 18-24, with the Repub­lic set to host the MLBB M2 World Cham­pi­onship be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>Teams will com­pete for a prize purse of US$300,000 (S$402,210) at the Shangri-La Ho­tel with the nec­es­sary Covid-19 mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The M2 World Cham­pi­onship is co-or­gan­ised by Mo­bile Leg­ends game de­vel­oper Moon­ton and the Sin­ga­pore’s Cy­ber­sports and On­line Gam­ing As­so­ci­a­tion (Scoga) with the sup­port of the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
    <p>Mo­bile Leg­ends is a mo­bile multi-player on­line bat­tle arena game in which two op­pos­ing teams bat­tle to de­stroy the en­emy’s base while de­fend­ing their own base and the teams vie for con­trol of a path, which con­nects the bases.</p>
    <p>When asked about the Covid-19 pro­to­cols, Moon­ton said it has “worked to­gether with var­i­ous in­dus­try ex­perts to put up an op­er­a­tional plan that ad­heres to the safe man­age­ment mea­sures re­quired by the local au­thor­i­ties”, but did not pro­vide spe­cific de­tails.</p>
    <p>It said that more in­for­ma­tion about the num­ber of peo­ple who are ex­pected to fly in for the com­pe­ti­tion would be avail­able once the teams are an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The M2 World Cham­pi­onship will be the sec­ond live sports event to wel­come over­seas-based ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion One Cham­pi­onship has been work­ing with the STB to stage sev­eral events here since Oct 9, which have all fea­tured for­eign-based fight­ers.</p>
    <p>There have been strict mea­sures in place for each of the three fights, in­clud­ing last night’s Big Bang event.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time that the STB is back­ing an e-sports tour­na­ment. It also sup­ported the US$1 mil­lion Dota 2 Sin­ga­pore Ma­jor or­gan­ised by One Es­ports, which was sched­uled for June, but even­tu­ally did not ma­te­ri­alise be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Jean Ng, STB’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for at­trac­tions, en­ter­tain­ment and tourism con­cept de­vel­op­ment, said: “The growth of e-sports con­tin­ues to ac­cel­er­ate es­pe­cially in such un­cer­tain times. We are heartened to wel­come a global ti­tle like Mo­bile Leg­ends, as we safely and grad­u­ally re­sume events in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Moon­ton’s con­fi­dence in host­ing the M2 World Cham­pi­onship in Sin­ga­pore is a tes­ta­ment to our rep­u­ta­tion as a safe and trusted des­ti­na­tion and we will con­tinue to step up the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures to en­sure the safety and well-be­ing of all vis­i­tors.”</p>
    <p>Nicholas Khoo, co-founder of Scoga, added: “Host­ing one of the world’s big­gest events right here in Sin­ga­pore not only gives hope to so many e-sports fans in a time of un­prece­dented dis­rup­tion, it also pro­vides many op­por­tu­ni­ties to Sin­ga­pore­ans and en­cour­age­ment to pur­sue their dreams and as­pi­ra­tions.”</p>
