    <p>LIS­BON • Bay­ern Mu­nich head into to­mor­row’s Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal against Paris Saint-Ger­main in im­pec­ca­ble form and with a real chance to be­come the first team to win the com­pe­ti­tion with a 100 per cent record.</p>
    <p>The fact that the Bavar­ian gi­ants have reached the Euro­pean Cup fi­nal in ev­ery decade from the 1970s shows the club’s con­sis­tency and re­sults this sea­son speak of their cur­rent dom­i­na­tion of op­po­nents – at home and abroad.</p>
    <p>They have not been beaten this year, pick­ing up a record-ex­tend­ing eighth straight Bun­desliga ti­tle and the Ger­man Cup for the 20th time along the way.</p>
    <p>The lack of com­pe­ti­tion in the do­mes­tic league has also not ham­pered Bay­ern, who won all six games in the Cham­pi­ons League group stage, in­clud­ing big wins over last sea­son’s fi­nal­ists, Tot­ten­ham, be­fore beat­ing Chelsea 7-1 on ag­gre­gate in the last 16 and crush­ing Barcelona 8-2 in the quar­ter- fi­nals.</p>
    <p>No team have ever won the ti­tle in the Cham­pi­ons League era with a 100 per cent record and the only other side to reach the fi­nal by win­ning all their games were AC Mi­lan in 1993, with the Serie A side los­ing the de­cider to Mar­seille.</p>
    <p>But for­mer Schalke coach Ralf Rangnick feels Bay­ern are primed to break the mould, telling Kicker mag­a­zine: “In the past 30 years, they have never played at such a high level tac­ti­cally as they are at the mo­ment un­der Hansi Flick.”</p>
    <p>Flick, 55, will write him­self into Bay­ern folk­lore should they lift their sixth Euro­pean Cup and sec­ond-ever tre­ble in what is his first job as a head coach.</p>
    <p>He was ini­tially ap­pointed as only the in­terim boss when Niko Ko­vac was sacked last Novem­ber, but he has won over all doubters.</p>
    <p>“We can all be happy that we chose Hansi Flick and put our trust in him,” said Bay­ern chair­man Kar­lHeinz Rum­menigge. “He’s re­turned that trust a hun­dred­fold.”</p>
    <p>Bay­ern have won 32 of their 35 games un­der Flick, earn­ing him a con­tract ex­ten­sion un­til 2023.</p>
    <p>With a 20-game win­ning streak be­hind them, the play­ers are con­fi­dent ahead of the fi­nal with PSG.</p>
    <p>“Our game hasn’t been so well or­gan­ised since (for­mer coach) Pep Guardi­ola,” said for­ward Thomas Muller.</p>
    <p>“Hansi Flick has al­ways been a great guy, very clear in what he tells us.”</p>
    <p>Mid­fielder Corentin Tolisso said: “He’s a good coach who talks a lot with his play­ers and gives them a lot of con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>For 19-year-old Alphonso Davies, who is set to make his­tory as the first Cana­dian to play in the fi­nal,</p>
    <p>GER­MAN PRE­CI­SION</p>
    <p>In the past 30 years, they have never played at such a high level tac­ti­cally as they are at the mo­ment un­der Hansi Flick. ’’</p>
    <p>RALF RANGNICK, for­mer Schalke coach, on Bay­ern Mu­nich’s dis­play this sea­son.</p>
    <p>this will be the cul­mi­na­tion of a break­through year that has seen the full-back her­alded as the best player to have ever come out of Ma­jor League Soc­cer.</p>
    <p>“It’s ev­ery­thing you can ask for,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It feels good, ev­ery­one’s happy and play­ing well. Paris are a good team, it’s go­ing to be a good game, there’s go­ing to be goals in it.</p>
    <p>“This is what you dream of as a foot­baller – play­ing against the best in Europe. I’m ex­cited.”</p>
