    <p>In early March, con­cert or­gan­iser LAMC put on a show fea­tur­ing Ger­man band Scor­pi­ons and English band Whites­nake that pulled in a near-ca­pac­ity, 5,000 crowd at The Star Theatre.</p>
    <p>It turned out to be one of the last ma­jor con­certs in Sin­ga­pore be­fore re­stric­tions and so­cial dis­tanc­ing kicked in.</p>
    <p>“Our con­cert busi­ness de­clined 100 per cent, all the shows sched­uled were wiped out,” co-owner Ross Knud­son, 56, said of the im­pact the Covid-19 out­break had on the com­pany.</p>
    <p>He runs LAMC with his wife,</p>
    <p>Lau­retta Alabons, 49.</p>
    <p>A con­cert by Amer­i­can bands Slip­knot and Triv­ium, orig­i­nally sched­uled for March, was post­poned to Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>But with mass gath­er­ings and in­ter­na­tional travel still cur­tailed, that show looks set to be resched­uled too.</p>
    <p>Formed in 2001, LAMC has or­gan­ised hun­dreds of con­certs fea­tur­ing in­ter­na­tional artists rang­ing from pop stars Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga to metal band Me­tal­lica and in­die vet­eran Mor­ris­sey.</p>
    <p>In 2017, it put on a show by</p>
    <p>United States band Guns N’ Roses at the Changi Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre that at­tracted close to 50,000.</p>
    <p>With­out any rev­enue from its main busi­ness, the sit­u­a­tion looks grim but the com­pany is us­ing the down­time to fo­cus on new ven­tures.</p>
    <p>It launched a pod­cast, Words and Music, in which Ms Alabons, a for­mer ra­dio pre­sen­ter and television host, in­ter­views artists and per­son­al­i­ties from the global en­ter­tain­ment world.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Alabons: “It’s some­thing we’ve al­ways wanted to do but never had the time be­cause we were so busy with the shows.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing on this pod­cast has not only helped keep morale up among our staff, it also keeps us con­nected and up-to-date with artists and all that’s hap­pen­ing in the global en­ter­tain­ment busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>LAMC also went into e-com­merce, sell­ing con­cert mer­chan­dise that has been pil­ing up in its ware­house.</p>
    <p>It also started pro­mot­ing on­line per­for­mances, such as an up­com­ing Christ­mas con­cert by English vet­eran singer En­gel­bert Humperdinc­k.</p>
    <p>With the help of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, the com­pany has re­tained its six full-time staff, al­though it im­ple­mented pay cuts.</p>
    <p>The two own­ers them­selves stopped tak­ing any salary from the com­pany and are get­ting by on their sav­ings and in­come from prop­erty rentals.</p>
    <p>“It’s chal­leng­ing but we are able to wait this out and come back into the con­cert busi­ness when the time is right,” said Mr Knud­son. “We’re try­ing to just be op­ti­mistic, roll with it and see what hap­pens.”</p>
