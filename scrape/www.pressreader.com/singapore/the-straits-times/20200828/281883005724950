    <p>WASHINGTON • The US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion’s (CDC) shift i n guid­ance on Covid-19 test­ing away from asymp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als this week alarmed many pub­lic health ex­perts, who say it is a wrong turn that could re­strict test numbers.</p>
    <p>Mr Brett Giroir, a top Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial over­see­ing coro­n­avirus test­ing, fired back against the crit­i­cism dur­ing a Wed­nes­day brief­ing, telling re­porters the change was not in­flu­enced by the White House and is in­tended to clar­ify to the pub­lic the lim­i­ta­tions of such screen­ings, not to re­duce how many tests are con­ducted. The new rec­om­men­da­tions say test­ing may not be needed for asymp­to­matic close con­tacts and those who at­tended large, risky gath­er­ings but lack symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Mr Giroir said that in ar­eas with high virus rates, many peo­ple with­out symp­toms will be tested at “surge screen­ing sites”, which he con­trasted with some­one in a “place where it’s 1 per cent pos­i­tive say­ing I want to get tested today, to­mor­row and the next day”.</p>
    <p>He re­sponded to the blow­back: “I’m re­ally not sure how peo­ple could in­ter­pret that if they ac­tu­ally read them be­cause what we’ve tried to do is put more re­spon­si­bil­ity on pub­lic health of­fi­cials.”</p>
    <p>CNN re­ported on Wed­nes­day that the CDC guid­ance change was due to pres­sure from Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, cit­ing an uniden­ti­fied of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo called the move “po­lit­i­cal pro­pa­ganda” and an ef­fort by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to bring down the num­ber of cases with less test­ing.</p>
    <p>But Mr Giroir said that the guide­lines had been a joint ef­fort, with the in­volve­ment of top health of­fi­cials in­clud­ing Dr An­thony Fauci, who has been one of the most prom­i­nent ad­min­is­tra­tion voices on the virus. Mr Giroir said the fi­nal draft was cir­cu­lated yes­ter­day at a White House Coro­n­avirus Task Force meet­ing. Dr Fauci, direc­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases (Ni­aid), was in surgery that day though and did not at­tend the meet­ing, Ni­aid said.</p>
