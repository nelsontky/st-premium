    <p>We re­fer to Se­nior Health Cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik’s com­men­tary (Steep MediShield pre­mium hikes and what they sig­nal about af­ford­able health­care, Oct 15).</p>
    <p>MediShield Life pre­mi­ums are ac­tu­ar­i­ally de­ter­mined, with each age group pay­ing pre­mi­ums to sup­port their own needs. This en­sures that MediShield Life re­mains sus­tain­able even as our pop­u­la­tion ages.</p>
    <p>Se­niors are more likely to be hos­pi­talised and make claims. Among se­niors above 65 years old, about one in six re­ceived a MediShield Life pay­out last year, com­pared with about one in 30 for the rest of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>They also tend to have more se­ri­ous con­di­tions, and hence, larger bills. This is why their pre­mi­ums are higher.</p>
    <p>The com­men­tary in­di­cated that this should not have an im­pact on MediShield Life pre­mium in­creases.</p>
    <p>Fac­tors such as in­creas­ing num­ber of claims and pay­out amounts for se­niors con­trib­ute to the pre­mium in­creases. The num­ber of claims by se­niors and pay­out amount to them have in­creased by al­most 50 per cent, from 229,000 claims and $363 mil­lion in 2016, to 333,000 claims and $541 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>The growth is about 70 per cent and 90 per cent higher than the rest of the pop­u­la­tion re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, pre­mium in­creases are also needed be­cause of ben­e­fit en­hance­ments such as in­creases in claim lim­its and ex­pan­sion of cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>This also in­cludes en­hance­ments since 2018 with­out pre­mium ad­just­ments, such as ex­ten­sion to in­pa­tient hos­pices and higher, more gran­u­lar claim lim­its for sur­gi­cal pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment pro­vides sig­nif­i­cant sub­si­dies to keep pre­mi­ums af­ford­able for our se­niors. About half of their to­tal pre­mi­ums were paid by the Gov­ern­ment last year.</p>
    <p>Pioneers and Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion se­niors also re­ceive Medis­ave top-ups, which can be used for pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>Younger pol­i­cy­hold­ers pay more pre­mi­ums dur­ing their work­ing years, which are set aside for fu­ture pre­mium re­bates to moder­ate pre­mium in­creases in their old age.</p>
    <p>With gov­ern­ment sup­port mea­sures, in­clud­ing the ad­di­tional Covid-19 sub­sidy, the net pre­mium in­creases for all Sin­ga­pore­ans will be no more than about 10 per cent in the first year.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment alone can­not slow pre­mium in­creases or the rise in health­care costs. Ev­ery­one has to play a part, such as by us­ing health­care ser­vices ap­pro­pri­ately.</p>
    <p>To­gether, ap­pro­pri­ate care can re­main af­ford­able for all Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
