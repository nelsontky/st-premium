    <p>In 2015, Ms Ong Li Hui was breast­feed­ing her son when she felt pain on the left side of her breast.</p>
    <p>She thought it was due to a clogged milk duct, but it grew more in­tense as months passed. Fi­nally, she went for a check-up af­ter find­ing a lump in her left breast.</p>
    <p>A biopsy in Oc­to­ber that year found that the re­cep­tion­ist-cumad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant, who was then in her 30s, had stage 3 can­cer. Though can­cer cells were found only in her left breast, she de­cided to un­dergo a bi­lat­eral mas­tec­tomy – the re­moval of both breasts – to pre­vent the spread of the can­cer to the right breast.</p>
    <p>She thought that would put an end to her or­deal, but in De­cem­ber last year, a check-up showed that the can­cer had spread to her hip bone. This meant she had ad­vanced breast can­cer, also re­ferred to as metastatic or stage 4 breast can­cer – that has spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, lungs or brain.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong, 41, who has two sons aged seven and 11, was “shocked” and “lost” fol­low­ing the di­ag­no­sis. “It was quite a blow to be told I had</p>
    <p>late-stage can­cer.”</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, more women are be­ing di­ag­nosed with ad­vanced breast can­cer.</p>
    <p>There were 910 such cases recorded from 2011 to 2015, up from 697 cases from 2006 to 2010, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Can­cer Reg­istry’s An­nual Reg­istry Re­port 2015, which was re­leased in 2017.</p>
    <p>There are also more younger women be­ing di­ag­nosed with breast can­cer. From 2011 to 2015, 4,616 women be­low age 54 were di­ag­nosed with breast can­cer, up from 4,577 from 2006 to 2010.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, it is the lead­ing can­cer among women, with 9,634 new cases recorded from 2011 to 2015. It is the top killer among all can­cers di­ag­nosed in women. About four in five pa­tients with stage 4 breast can­cer do not live past five years, notes Dr Lee Guek Eng, a se­nior con­sul­tant at Icon Can­cer Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Dr Tira Tan, a con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Can­cer Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore’s di­vi­sion of med­i­cal on­col­ogy, says there is a need to raise aware­ness about the dis­ease be­cause its in­ci­dence is “ris­ing ex­po­nen­tially”.</p>
    <p>“This in­cludes breast can­cer of</p>
    <p>all stages af­fect­ing women of all ages. Young women are not spared,” she adds.</p>
    <p>The rise in breast can­cer cases among pre­menopausal women may be due to fac­tors such as a de­lay in child­birth, al­co­hol con­sump­tion, smok­ing, and an un­healthy and seden­tary life­style, says Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>The main risk fac­tors for breast can­cer in­clude age, race, fam­ily and per­sonal his­tory of can­cer, early on­set of men­stru­a­tion and late menopause.</p>
    <p>Symp­toms of ad­vanced breast can­cer in­clude a lump in the breast, neck or un­der the arms, nip­ple dis­charge, per­sis­tent bone pain, per­sis­tent cough, short­ness of breath and headache.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee says many young women do not as­so­ci­ate a lump or other symp­toms as a sign of can­cer, as they think they are young and not at risk.</p>
    <p>“This means that when they even­tu­ally visit a doc­tor, the can­cer would usu­ally be larger, more ag­gres­sive and di­ag­nosed at an ad­vanced stage,” Dr Lee, a spe­cial­ist in med­i­cal on­col­ogy, adds.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan says that while ad­vanced</p>
    <p>breast can­cer is not cur­able, it can be treated and man­aged through treat­ments such as chemo­ther­apy, im­munother­apy and hormone ther­apy, depend­ing on the sub­type of the can­cer.</p>
    <p>Both doc­tors stress the im­por­tance of seek­ing med­i­cal at­ten­tion early if there are signs and symp­toms of ad­vanced breast can­cer.</p>
    <p>A com­mu­ni­ca­tions ex­ec­u­tive, who wanted to be known only as Amanda, wasted no time in go­ing for a check-up when she felt a lump in her right breast in 2016. She was di­ag­nosed with ad­vanced breast can­cer, and last year, she found out it had spread to her lungs and brain.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old is now on oral tar­geted ther­apy and hormone ther­apy to treat the can­cer.</p>
    <p>She says: “The news of the dis­ease spread­ing came as a shock, but I knew I had to face it with­out fear. I even asked one of my friends to make sure my funeral mat­ters are taken care of, be­cause I do not want my par­ents to worry.”</p>
    <p>The ill­ness put a strain on her mar­riage and led to a di­vorce in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>But she has nev­er­the­less tried to re­main pos­i­tive. “My friends and fam­ily have sup­ported me through the jour­ney and en­cour­aged me,” she says.</p>
    <p>Both Ms Ong and Ms Amanda have adopted a health­ier life­style – cut­ting down on dessert and fast food and eat­ing more fruit and veg­eta­bles. They also make it a point to ex­er­cise ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>While there is no sure way to pre­vent can­cer, the risk can be low­ered through a healthy diet and reg­u­lar ex­er­cise, says Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes do­ing 150 min­utes of mod­er­ate-in­ten­sity aer­o­bic ac­tiv­ity a week, lim­it­ing al­co­hol con­sump­tion, not smok­ing and main­tain­ing a healthy weight.</p>
    <p>The Health Pro­mo­tion Board also rec­om­mends women aged 40 to 49 to go for a mam­mo­gram once a year, and women aged 50 and above to go once ev­ery two years.</p>
    <p>Says Dr Tan: “A mam­mo­gram is im­por­tant as early stages of breast can­cer may show no signs or symp­toms. The ear­lier a can­cer is found, the bet­ter the treat­ment op­tions and the greater the chances of sur­vival.”</p>
