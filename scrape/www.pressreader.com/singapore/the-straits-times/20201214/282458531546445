    <p>STAN­DARD CHAR­TERED BANK’S STEVEN ENGLANDER, on the Fed­eral Open Mar­ket Com­mit­tee’s last meet­ing of the year.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Af­ter a year in which the Fed­eral Re­serve pushed out un­prece­dented lend­ing to sup­port the US econ­omy while plead­ing for govern­ment stim­u­lus that never came, cen­tral bankers could show signs of op­ti­mism this week.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy-set­ting Fed­eral Open Mar­ket Com­mit­tee (FOMC) will open its fi­nal meet­ing of this year to­mor­row, cap­ping a year that saw the world’s largest econ­omy con­tract mas­sively due to Covid-19, and Mr Joe Bi­den oust Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in last month’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Fed and its chair Jerome Pow­ell likely will, as usual, steer clear of mak­ing any po­lit­i­cal state­ment, but ex­perts ex­pect them to up­date their view on how the econ­omy will fare next year as vac­cines against the virus are rolled out.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the out­look is not en­tirely clear.</p>
    <p>“This is ac­tu­ally a pretty dif­fi­cult</p>
    <p>FOMC to an­a­lyse,” Mr Steven Englander of Stan­dard Char­tered Bank said. “Pick­ing up the pieces is go­ing to be more com­pli­cated and will kind of look more com­pli­cated in six months than it does now.”</p>
    <p>Loom­ing over the meet­ing is the con­tin­ued fail­ure of Congress to pass an­other spend­ing pack­age to help the virus-struck econ­omy re­cover – some­thing Mr Pow­ell and other cen­tral bankers have gen­tly but per­sis­tently urged them to do for months.</p>
    <p>Mr Pow­ell will hold a press con­fer­ence af­ter the meet­ing ends on Wed­nes­day, but be­yond more prod­ding, there is lit­tle he can do to close the thus far in­sur­mount­able gaps be­tween Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can law­mak­ers, said Ms Rubeela Fa­rooqi of High Fre­quency Eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>“He’s go­ing to sound a con­cerned and cau­tious note about what’s hap­pen­ing with the econ­omy, but I don’t ex­pect him to take a strong tone on what needs to be done on fis­cal pol­icy,” she said.</p>
    <p>BIG MOVES</p>
    <p>The US cen­tral bank slashed its lend­ing rate to zero when the pan­demic ar­rived in March, and more re­cently un­veiled a new in­fla­tion­tar­get­ing pol­icy that will en­sure the bench­mark lend­ing rate will re­main lower for longer to max­imise em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The Fed also rolled out tril­lions of dol­lars in lend­ing and liq­uid­ity lines to keep mar­kets func­tion­ing as busi­ness shut­downs to stop virus trans­mis­sion stressed the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Some of the loans were backed by govern­ment funds, and con­tro­versy erupted last month when Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin told the Fed to re­turn hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars in un­used loan money, shut­ting down sev­eral loan pro­grammes, prompt­ing an un­usual pub­lic protest from the cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>Democrats ac­cused Mr Mnuchin of try­ing to tie the hands of Mr Bi­den, who takes of­fice in Jan­uary, but Mr Englander said Mr Pow­ell and the pol­i­tics-averse Fed are un­likely to ad­dress the is­sue fur­ther.</p>
    <p>WHAT ABOUT BONDS?</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts will be watch­ing to see if the Fed, ab­sent stim­u­lus and with its hands tied on more lend­ing, makes good on its plans to change its bond buy­ing strat­egy, which of­fi­cials dis­cussed do­ing at their meet­ing last month.</p>
    <p>The Fed has been buy­ing mas­sive amounts of debt, and in­creas­ing pur­chases on longer-term Trea­sury se­cu­ri­ties could pro­vide ad­di­tional stim­u­lus to the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But Mr Englander pre­dicted the Fed will use the meet­ing to fo­cus mostly on re­as­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>“The ideal would be, if they could come out not do­ing very much and cer­tainly not do­ing much that would re­veal di­vi­sions within the FOMC, but which would con­vey to the mar­ket in an emer­gency, or any sort of stress sit­u­a­tion, they’re go­ing to be there,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Fed also will re­lease its quar­terly sum­mary of eco­nomic projects at the meet­ing, which will give an in­di­ca­tion of how pol­i­cy­mak­ers view the out­look over the next three years, fac­tor­ing in re­cent good news on vac­cines.</p>
    <p>More up­beat growth fore­casts could spook stock mar­kets wor­ried the Fed would re­move the stim­u­lus sooner than ex­pected, Wells Fargo Se­cu­ri­ties said in an anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the FOMC likely will con­tinue “sig­nalling it will be in no hurry to raise the Fed funds rate”, Wells Fargo said.</p>
