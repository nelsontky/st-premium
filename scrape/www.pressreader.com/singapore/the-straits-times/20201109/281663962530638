    <p>Education Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong and Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee have been elected to the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s (PAP) top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body for the first time, re­flect­ing the ac­knowl­edge­ment by cadres of their promi­nence on the na­tional stage.</p>
    <p>Both men, who are seen as key mem­bers of the PAP’s fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship team, were coopted into the cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee (CEC) at the last bi­en­nial party con­fer­ence in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers and party cadres say the re­sults of yes­ter­day’s election sig­nal con­ti­nu­ity and sta­bil­ity in the PAP’s lead­er­ship ranks amid the on­go­ing cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, 47, co-chairs the multi-min­istry Covid-19 task force, while Mr Lee, 44, co-chairs a task force to help Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy emerge stronger from the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Over 2,000 party cadres voted at the PAP’s bi­en­nial party con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, with the top 12 nom­i­nees elected for a two-year term. The other CEC mem­bers are Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, 68; Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, 59; Mr Chan Chun Sing, 51; Mr Gan Kim Yong, 61; Ms Grace Fu, 56; Mr K. Shan­mugam, 61; Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, 57; Mr Ong Ye Kung, 50; Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, 51, and Dr Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan, 59.</p>
    <p>The 12 were elected by se­cret bal­lot from a list of 19 nom­i­nees.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters In­dra­nee Ra­jah, 57, who was among the top 12 in 2018, and Josephine Teo, 52, were coopted into the CEC as they got the 13th and 14th high­est votes.</p>
    <p>The other names on the bal­lot were labour chief Ng Chee Meng, 52, newly pro­moted min­is­ters Ma­liki Os­man, 55, and Ed­win Tong, 51; Se­nior Min­is­ter of State Janil Puthuc­heary, 48, and North West Dis­trict Mayor Alex Yam, 39.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who lost the con­test for Sengkang GRC in the July gen­eral election, had been elected into the top 12 in 2018.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Tan from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment University’s law school said a pos­si­ble rea­son for Mr Ng’s omis­sion from the top 12 could be that he was not re-elected as an MP in GE2020.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­si­ble rea­son, cadres say, is Mr Ng was not viewed in the same light as oth­ers with min­is­te­rial port­fo­lios. Ob­servers be­lieve Mr Ng would be co-opted into the CEC for union rep­re­sen­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>On newer min­is­ters not get­ting in, for­mer PAP MP In­der­jit Singh said cadres want to see a slower tran­si­tion to the 4G at this stage.</p>
    <p>Dr Mustafa Iz­zud­din, a se­nior an­a­lyst at man­age­ment con­sul­tancy firm So­laris Strate­gies Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Wong and Mr Lee’s election into the CEC reaf­firms their im­por­tance in the 4G team.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Bil­veer Singh, deputy head at the Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore’s depart­ment of po­lit­i­cal sci­ence, added both are fu­ture PM can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan noted that Mr Lee has the long­est run­way among his CEC col­leagues. “He may well be a stal­wart of the 5G lead­er­ship,” he said.</p>
