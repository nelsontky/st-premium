    <p>Bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s Ant Group will con­tinue with its ap­pli­ca­tion for a dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cence in Sin­ga­pore, even af­ter the com­pany’s record US$37 bil­lion (S$50 bil­lion) dual list­ings in China and Hong Kong were sud­denly halted. A source fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that it is busi­ness as usual in Sin­ga­pore and Ant’s other over­seas mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s Ant Group will con­tinue with its ap­pli­ca­tion for a dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cence in Sin­ga­pore, even af­ter the com­pany’s record US$37 bil­lion (S$49.9 bil­lion) dual list­ings in China and Hong Kong were sud­denly halted.</p>
    <p>A source fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter yes­ter­day told The Straits Times it is busi­ness as usual in Sin­ga­pore and Ant’s other over­seas mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany is fo­cus­ing on com­mu­ni­cat­ing with the Shang­hai Stock Ex­change and fol­low­ing up on fur­ther de­vel­op­ments with re­spect to the IPO (ini­tial public of­fer­ing), so there is no im­pact on busi­ness op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“The team is op­er­at­ing as per nor­mal and there is no change to the li­cence ap­pli­ca­tion here,” said the source.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, China’s largest on­line fi­nan­cial plat­form said it had ap­plied for a dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cence in Sin­ga­pore as it ramps up ef­forts to ex­pand out­side main­land China.</p>
    <p>Ant Fi­nan­cial, which was re­named Ant Group in June ahead of its IPO, said in Jan­uary it had sub­mit­ted an ap­pli­ca­tion to the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) for a dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­cence, which would al­low it to serve cor­po­rate clients.</p>
    <p>MAS will is­sue up to two dig­i­tal full bank li­cences and three dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­cences by the end of this year, in one of Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest steps to lib­er­alise its fi­nan­cial in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The li­cences will al­low en­ti­ties, in­clud­ing non-bank play­ers, to</p>
    <p>con­duct dig­i­tal bank­ing busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that Ant is</p>
    <p>among the ap­pli­cants shortliste­d for el­i­gi­bil­ity, al­though MAS has not re­leased any names.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from ST, an MAS spokesman said: “MAS is un­able to com­ment on the in­volve­ment of any ap­pli­cant as this is con­fi­den­tial. MAS will con­sider all rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion that has bear­ing on the as­sess­ment of ap­pli­cants.”</p>
    <p>In June, MAS said that 14 of the 21 dig­i­tal bank ap­pli­ca­tions met the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria re­quired and will progress to the next stage of as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>The el­i­gi­ble ap­pli­ca­tions com­prise five for full bank li­cences and nine for whole­sale li­cences.</p>
    <p>A dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­censee, whose cus­tomers are lim­ited to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises and other non-re­tail seg­ments, needs $100 mil­lion in cap­i­tal and can be ma­jor­ity-owned by for­eign en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Con­tenders for a dig­i­tal full bank li­cence in­clude the Be­yond con­sor­tium, led by Osim founder Ron Sim’s V3 Group and EZ-Link; a Grab-Sing­tel joint ven­ture; and a con­sor­tium that in­cludes gam­ing firm Razer.</p>
    <p>Ant’s main busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore is its cross-bor­der pay­ment ser­vice Ali­pay, which caters to Chi­nese tourists and ex­pa­tri­ates here.</p>
    <p>It also holds a stake in mo­bile wal­lets in other coun­tries in the re­gion, such as Malaysia, Thai­land and In­done­sia, and ad­vises them on prod­uct de­vel­op­ment and fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>Its for­mer par­ent com­pany, Chi­nese tech gi­ant Alibaba, owns Lazada, a ma­jor player in Sin­ga­pore’s e-com­merce scene.</p>
