    <p>The In­dian army has asked its Chi­nese coun­ter­part if five civil­ians who went miss­ing from an eastern bor­der state days ago were in its cus­tody, an In­dian mil­i­tary spokesman said yes­ter­day. Re­la­tions be­tween the nu­clear-armed Asian gi­ants have hit a multi-decade low since clashes at their west­ern Hi­malayan bor­der in June that killed 20 In­dian sol­diers.</p>
    <p>(In­dia) • The In­dian army has asked its Chi­nese coun­ter­part if five civil­ians who went miss­ing from an eastern bor­der state days ago were in their cus­tody, an In­dian mil­i­tary spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween the nu­cle­ar­armed Asian gi­ants have hit a mul­ti­decade low since clashes at their west­ern Hi­malayan bor­der in June that killed 20 In­dian sol­diers.</p>
    <p>Both sides have since stepped up mon­i­tor­ing of their largely unset­tled 3,488km bor­der.</p>
    <p>Late last month, the two coun­tries were in­volved in a skir­mish near Pan­gong Tso – a glacial lake at an al­ti­tude of more than 4,300m – along the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol.</p>
    <p>In­dia said its sol­diers were able to stop a push by Chi­nese troops to claim more ground in vi­o­la­tion of ex­ist­ing agree­ments, while Bei­jing de­nied that its troops strayed into In­dian ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­ci­dent in­volves five miss­ing men from the In­dian bor­der state of Arunachal Pradesh. This state is also claimed by China, which calls it South Ti­bet.</p>
    <p>The In­dian mil­i­tary said it told China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) about the five last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“We spoke with them on the hot­line and told them that it’s sus­pected that some peo­ple have crossed (over) to your side and we will be grate­ful if you could hand them... back, as per what we do nor­mally,” said In­dia’s de­fence forces spokesman Harsh Ward­han Pande.</p>
    <p>“There is no ear­marked line go­ing through the for­est or the moun­tains, so they keep mov­ing here and there. So they might have gone there. It’s a very nor­mal thing.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, In­dia’s Min­is­ter of State for Mi­nor­ity Af­fairs Kiren Rijiju, who is also a law­maker from Arunachal Pradesh, said the mil­i­tary hot­line meant to defuse bor­der ten­sions was ac­ti­vated over</p>
    <p>In­dia and China went to war in 1962 over Arunachal Pradesh, a strate­gi­cally im­por­tant bor­der area, with Chi­nese troops tem­po­rar­ily cap­tur­ing part of the Hi­malayan ter­ri­tory. The dis­pute re­mains un­re­solved. China stakes claim to about 90,000 sq km of the area – nearly all of what con­sti­tutes Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
    <p>the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“The In­dian Army has al­ready sent hot­line mes­sage to the coun­ter­part PLA es­tab­lish­ment at the bor­der point in Arunachal Pradesh. Re­sponse is awaited,” he said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The Arunachal Times re­ported last Satur­day the men were hunt­ing when they were al­legedly snatched. It was not im­me­di­ately clear when they might have gone miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, China said it is not aware of the spe­cific case and its cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>“China’s po­si­tion on the eastern sec­tion of the China-In­dia bor­der and China’s south­ern Ti­bet is con­sis­tent and clear. We have never recog­nised the il­le­gally es­tab­lished Arunachal Pradesh on Chi­nese ter­ri­tory,” said For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian dur­ing a reg­u­lar me­dia brief­ing in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The al­leged in­ci­dent comes amid talks be­tween In­dia’s De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh and his Chi­nese</p>
    <p>coun­ter­part, Gen­eral Wei Fenghe, on the side­lines of an in­ter­na­tional meet­ing in Moscow last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said they had frank dis­cus­sions over the dis­puted Hi­malayan bor­der and the strained re­la­tions be­tween the world’s two most pop­u­lous coun­tries.</p>
    <p>While the pair agreed to ease ten­sions, they also re­leased ri­val state­ments ac­cus­ing each other of in­flam­ing the show­down.</p>
