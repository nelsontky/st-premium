    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Dare­devil ac­tor Peter Shinkoda (right) al­leges that his sto­ry­line in the Net­flix tele­vi­sion se­ries, which ran between 2015 and 2018, was cut be­cause for­mer Marvel Tele­vi­sion chief Jeph Loeb said “no­body cares about Asian peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Apol­o­gis­ing to his fel­low co-stars, Tommy Walker and Ge­of­frey Can­tor, the Cana­dian ac­tor said: “I’m go­ing to take this mo­ment… be­cause – be­cause I just have to.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on a #SaveDare­devil panel vir­tual round­table dis­cus­sion with other ac­tors from the show, he said that Mr Loeb’s sen­ti­ment was “re­it­er­ated many times by other writ­ers and showrun­ners”.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old said Mr Loeb, who left the com­pany last year, cited Marvel’s Blade tril­ogy, dur­ing which vam­pire hunter “Wes­ley Snipes kills 200 Asians each movie” and “no­body gives a s***”, as ev­i­dence of his be­lief. The orig­i­nal</p>
    <p>Blade tril­ogy was re­leased between 1998 and 2004.</p>
    <p>Shinkoda, who played Nobu Yosh­ioka, a high-rank­ing mem­ber of fic­tional su­pervil­lain or­gan­i­sa­tion The Hand, said the writ­ing team had made him “privy to a story that was sup­posed to go”.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor said Nobu’s arc had been “planned for months” but it was ul­ti­mately “pre­vented”. He added that the writ­ers “re­gret­ted it” and were “re­luc­tant” to cut the sto­ry­line, but “their hands were tied”.</p>
    <p>Shinkoda’s Nobu was not the only one who lost his sto­ry­line. Mr Loeb had al­legedly also told writ­ers not to write for Madame Gao, one of the five lead­ing founders of The Hand.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong ac­tress Wai Ching Ho, 76, who played Madame Gao, also ap­peared in other Marvel pro­duc­tions, in­clud­ing Iron Fist (2017).</p>
    <p>Shinkoda said nei­ther he nor Wai was in­vited to the show’s sea­son two premiere.</p>
