    <p>The abuse of pub­lic trans­port work­ers is “wrong and un­ac­cept­able”, and those who do it will face the full force of the law, said Senior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Chee Hong Tat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pun­ish­ment can in­clude up to three years in jail when convicted of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt.</p>
    <p>In a speech in Par­lia­ment, Mr Chee strongly con­demned the re­cent cases of com­muters who ver­bally and phys­i­cally abused bus driv­ers. He called for a “right so­ci­etal cul­ture, one that is based on re­spect for our front-line work­ers”.</p>
    <p>He said: “What we need is to take a clear stand. The Gov­ern­ment, unions, pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors, and I would say the great ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans are united in tak­ing a zero-tol­er­ance ap­proach to­wards such abu­sive be­hav­iours.”</p>
    <p>His warn­ing comes amid a rise in cases of ver­bal and phys­i­cal abuse of bus driv­ers by com­muters who did not wear a mask, which is manda­tory.</p>
    <p>He is­sued it when re­ply­ing to Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC), chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Trans­port, who had asked if more could be done by the Trans­port Min­istry to pro­tect bus driv­ers and other trans­port ser­vice staff.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said the min­istry is al­ready work­ing with trans­port op­er­a­tors and the unions to bet­ter pro­tect driv­ers, and wel­comed Mr Sak­tiandi’s more spe­cific sug­ges­tions, not­ing that ul­ti­mately, a col­lec­tive ef­fort from all in­volved – in­clud­ing com­muters – is what is needed.</p>
    <p>The se­ri­ous­ness of the egre­gious trend has also led the Na­tional Trans­port Work­ers’ Union (NTWU) to re­vive an idea floated two years ago of in­stalling a plas­tic shield around the bus driver’s seat as pro­tec­tion against un­ruly com­muters.</p>
    <p>The union is test­ing pos­si­ble mod­els now. MP and NTWU ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Melvin Yong asked Mr Chee, who is also Senior Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs, if the Land</p>
    <p>Trans­port Authority would sup­port such a move on all pub­lic buses if a suit­able model were found.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said feed­back would have to be sought from the bus driv­ers, as a sim­i­lar trial in 2018 found that the shields cre­ated glare which af­fected their driv­ing. “Ul­ti­mately, this is for both the pro­tec­tion and safety of the bus cap­tains, and also for the safety of com­muters,” he added.</p>
