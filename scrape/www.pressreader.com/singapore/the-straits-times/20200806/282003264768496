    <p>A 25-year-old per­son has be­come the youngest to die from dengue in Sin­ga­pore this year.</p>
    <p>With­out re­veal­ing more de­tails of the case, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day that the lat­est death takes the num­ber of peo­ple who have died from dengue this year to 20 as of Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Their ages ranged be­tween 25 and 92. Of the 20, 18 worked or lived in ac­tive dengue clus­ters, which cur­rently num­ber 391.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School said that it is un­com­mon for young adults to be so se­ri­ously af­fected by the dis­ease, and added that he would need more in­for­ma­tion about the per­son’s med­i­cal back­ground to make more spe­cific con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>“In gen­eral, young chil­dren from five to nine or 10 years of age are at higher risk but this tails off when they be­come young adults,” said Prof Ooi, deputy di­rec­tor for the emerg­ing in­fec­tious diseases pro­gramme at the school.</p>
    <p>“So I would say it is not com­mon, but the risk is also not ab­sent.”</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Choon Kit, a fam­ily physi­cian at Mis­sion Med­i­cal Clinic, also said that those who are older are usu­ally more likely to die from dengue, but noted that peo­ple of all age groups have suf­fered ad­verse ef­fects from the in­fec­tion, in­clud­ing se­vere liver dam­age.</p>
    <p>“The dan­ger is not re­lated to a par­tic­u­lar age group. What we know is that those who get it bad usu­ally have early dam­age to their liver, low al­bu­min lev­els and are poorly hy­drated,” he said.</p>
    <p>The best pre­cau­tion then is for peo­ple to pro­tect them­selves against bites, get rid of breed­ing sites, see a doc­tor early, hy­drate and get enough rest.</p>
    <p>In 2016, an 11-year-old boy died of dengue in a rare case. MOH had said then: “Al­though un­com­mon, there have been pre­vi­ous cases of chil­dren aged 12 and be­low pass­ing away due to dengue.”</p>
