    <p>At the Singhu bor­der on the high­way con­nect­ing the north­ern In­dian state of Haryana with the cap­i­tal city of Delhi, thou­sands of farm­ers have con­gre­gated in what has be­come the heart of the re­sis­tance against three new farm laws.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the In­dian Par­lia­ment passed the laws dis­man­tling a sys­tem of gov­ern­ment-reg­u­lated whole­sale mar­kets and mid­dle­men and al­low­ing farm­ers to sell di­rectly to pri­vate firms.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers from Pun­jab and Haryana who are lead­ing the protests be­lieve the laws will ad­versely af­fect their liveli­hood.</p>
    <p>They have been at Singhu, one of many protest points, for three weeks, and show lit­tle sign of plan­ning to dis­perse, even as tem­per­a­tures hit a low of 4.1 deg C.</p>
    <p>They sleep in cov­ered trail­ers at­tached to trac­tors, which are parked in a line stretch­ing for around 2km along the high­way.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing any­where. This is my tem­po­rary house,” said</p>
    <p>Mr Nir­mal Singh, a 52-year-old farmer from Pun­jab, as he shelled peanuts in the trac­tor trailer that he shares with nine other farm­ers from his vil­lage.</p>
    <p>He has been at the protest since Nov 25, with his friends back home tak­ing care of his farm, where he grows wheat and paddy. “If they (the gov­ern­ment) don’t lis­ten to us, we will in­ten­sify the protests.”</p>
    <p>His trailer is lined with mat­tresses and blan­kets to pro­tect him from the cold.</p>
    <p>In a sign of sup­port for the farm­ers’ cause, an en­tire ecosys­tem has popped up to help them.</p>
    <p>Hot food is avail­able through­out the day at mul­ti­ple com­mu­nity kitchens at the site.</p>
    <p>These kitchens, run by fel­low farm­ers and other well-wish­ers, of­fer hot meals rang­ing from those that in­clude dal and veg­eta­bles to – on the rare oc­ca­sion – piz­zas.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows the tra­di­tion of the lan­gar, the com­mu­nity kitchen in Sikh shrines, or gur­d­waras, which of­fer free meals to all vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>There is even a fa­cil­ity for wash­ing clothes be­cause some­one had the fore­sight to trans­port wash­ing ma­chines to the site.</p>
    <p>A health cen­tre and even a den­tal clinic are avail­able, as well as free medicine coun­ters.</p>
    <p>“It is all part of sewa,” said Mr In­der­pal Singh, who handed out plas­ters to three lo­cal chil­dren who said their friend was hurt.</p>
    <p>Sewa, which refers to help­ing oth­ers with­out any per­sonal gain or re­ward, is a prin­ci­ple fol­lowed by the Sikhs, who form a ma­jor­ity in Pun­jab.</p>
    <p>Be­hind all this is a strong re­solve to ac­cept noth­ing less than the re­peal of the farm laws.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has of­fered a com­pro­mise and agreed to pass a law guar­an­tee­ing a min­i­mum sup­port price for cer­tain crops like wheat. But the protest­ing farm­ers said the farm laws dis­man­tle a sys­tem that has tided them over dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The mid­dle­men or agents of­ten act as an in­for­mal bank­ing sys­tem for the farm­ers.</p>
    <p>“The agent will give me money when­ever I need it and ac­cept crops much later. They lend us money for wed­dings and other ex­penses. A pri­vate firm will never do that,” said Mr Kul­winder Singh, a farmer from Ra­jasthan.</p>
    <p>“I have taken money for med­i­cal ex­penses and have (re­paid with) my crops six months later. I can call (the agent) any time, in­clud­ing at night. They are our bank,” he added.</p>
    <p>Still, agri­cul­ture in In­dia is in dire need of re­form. It is be­set by mul­ti­ple prob­lems, in­clud­ing a fail­ure to boost pro­duc­tiv­ity, de­pen­dence on rain for wa­ter, poor ir­ri­ga­tion fa­cil­i­ties and the grow­ing cost of items like fer­tiliser and seeds.</p>
    <p>Agri­cul­ture is just 15 per cent of In­dia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment ar­gues that the farm laws will push growth in the sec­tor and plough pri­vate in­vest­ment into agri­cul­ture, and ac­cuses op­po­si­tion po­lit­i­cal par­ties of mis­guid­ing farm­ers.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s gov­ern­ment, which weath­ered protests ear­lier and has re­fused to walk back any re­form leg­is­la­tion, has been try­ing to meet the farm­ers halfway by of­fer­ing to amend the laws.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Supreme Court, hear­ing a pe­ti­tion on end­ing the farm­ers’ demon­stra­tions, warned that the protests could soon be­come a “national is­sue” and sug­gested the gov­ern­ment sus­pend im­ple­men­ta­tion of the farm laws till ne­go­ti­a­tions yield some re­sult.</p>
    <p>For now, there is lit­tle sign of the protests pe­ter­ing out.</p>
    <p>“There are (hun­dreds of thou­sands) of us here. Five farm­ers leave, then 15 come,” said the farm­ers’ leader Baldev Singh Sirsa.</p>
    <p>“Now we are get­ting a lot of women who are join­ing the protests. We are not go­ing any­where till the farm laws are re­pealed.”</p>
