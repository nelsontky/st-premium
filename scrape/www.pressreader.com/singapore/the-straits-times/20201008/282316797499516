    <p>LONDON • Ever­ton striker Do­minic Calvert-Lewin, called up for Eng­land’s Na­tions League games af­ter a blis­ter­ing start to the Premier League sea­son, has been en­joy­ing some retro Serie A YouTube ses­sions as he looks to fine-tune his game.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old has blos­somed un­der man­ager Carlo Ancelotti’s guid­ance at Ever­ton. He has al­ready scored nine goals in all com­pe­ti­tions this sea­son, in­clud­ing two hat-tricks, help­ing the Tof­fees soar to the top of the Premier League ta­ble and progress to the quar­ter-fi­nals of the League Cup.</p>
    <p>Ancelotti re­cently com­pared him to pro­lific for­mer Italy striker Filippo In­za­ghi, who he coached at Ju­ven­tus and AC Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>Fa­mously de­scribed as be­ing “born off­side” by for­mer Manch­ester United boss Alex Fer­gu­son, In­za­ghi was a preda­tory poacher who scored more than 200 goals for both clubs.</p>
    <p>That prompted Calvert-Lewin, who could make his Eng­land de­but in to­day’s friendly against Wales, to search out In­za­ghi’s goals on­line as a way of point­ing him in the right di­rec­tion to de­velop his game.</p>
    <p>“Carlo has def­i­nitely had a pos­i­tive in­flu­ence on me,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In the past, I was guilty of do­ing my best work away from goal and now I am get­ting in be­tween the sticks and putting the ball in the back of the net.</p>
    <p>“That anal­ogy from Carlo was more just an em­pha­sis on be­ing in the right place at the right time, one-touch fin­ishes.</p>
    <p>“It was not to say that I am a car­bon copy of Pippo In­za­ghi, but that there are el­e­ments of his game that I have been show­ing in my game (such as) one-touch fin­ishes and be­ing in the right place to score.</p>
    <p>“So I had a YouTube of his goals and watched like a 15-minute reel of them, and ob­vi­ously, a lot of his goals are one-touch fin­ishes and he has got great move­ment. I am still learning so I try to take it in.”</p>
    <p>Calvert-Lewin is in line to win his first Eng­land cap to­day, with Gareth South­gate promis­ing not to field cap­tain Harry Kane in all of three matches in the space of seven days.</p>
    <p>The Three Lions face Bel­gium on Sun­day then Den­mark the fol­low­ing Wed­nes­day in the Na­tions League.</p>
    <p>South­gate’s squad have been de­pleted af­ter a de­lay in the ar­rivals of Tammy Abra­ham, Jadon San­cho and Ben Chilwell, pend­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion. All three at­tended a sur­prise birth­day party for Abra­ham on Satur­day that broke coro­n­avirus pro­to­col over gath­er­ings of more than six peo­ple.</p>
