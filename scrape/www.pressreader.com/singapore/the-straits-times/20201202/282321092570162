    <p>New tug ma­chines to trans­port 60 chairs in­stead of 10. New elec­tric vans to re­place old ones pow­ered by diesel. New mech­a­nised sweep­ers to re­duce overnight shifts for clean­ing staff.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are ex­am­ples of mea­sures put in place by the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre at Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) in prepa­ra­tion for the re­open­ing of meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) events.</p>
    <p>Safety is para­mount too. Ac­cord­ing to the work­place safety and health re­ports re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power an­nu­ally, the over­all num­ber of work­place in</p>
    <p>ju­ries rose from 12,810 in 2018 to 13,779 last year. Although the num­ber of fa­tal in­juries dropped from 41 in 2018 to 39 last year, the num­ber of mi­nor and ma­jor in­juries in­creased sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>In the Mice in­dus­try, em­ploy­ees usu­ally face in­creased risks from falls (es­pe­cially from heights), slips and mov­ing heavy items.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Wee Min, vice-pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>of Mice at MBS, who has long been think­ing of how to re­duce such risks, re­called an in­ci­dent in the Sands Grand Ball­room two years ago.</p>
    <p>“We saw a huge metal scaf­fold and one of the ex­ter­nal con­trac­tors was climb­ing on it to ad­just the lights,” he said. “To our hor­ror, we no­ticed (he had) no safety har­ness, no hel­met, noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong and his col­leagues take the is­sue se­ri­ously. As he put it, “the show will not go on” in the event of a work-re­lated in­jury or death.</p>
    <p>“And for the Mice in­dus­try, we’re all about the show,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong and his team were work­ing on es­tab­lish­ing more strin­gent work­place safety and health (WSH) mea­sures, but the Covid-19 pan­demic dealt a ma­jor blow to the in­dus­try. Now, as it slowly re­sumes op­er­a­tions, main­tain­ing safe dis­tanc­ing and clean­li­ness stan­dards are on top of WSH re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>For the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, this in­cluded train­ing all Mice team mem­bers in safe man­age­ment mea­sures and con­struct­ing a “hy­brid” broad­cast stu­dio with vir­tual con­fer­enc­ing op­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaqy Mo­hamad, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power, toured the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre yes­ter­day to view the new WSH prac­tices.</p>
    <p>He said it was won­der­ful to “see how the Mice in­dus­try has adapted to the cur­rent pan­demic while main­tain­ing a fo­cus on work­place and safety”.</p>
    <p>He also high­lighted the im­por­tance of the Mice in­dus­try to the na­tion’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing an in­ter­na­tional hub, it is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to show­case that we are able to cope with the pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>“There are knock-on ef­fects. You’ve got the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try that re­lies on the Mice in­dus­try too. The whole ecosys­tem has to click for us to re­main rel­e­vant.”</p>
    <p>In the Mice in­dus­try, em­ploy­ees usu­ally face in­creased risks from falls (es­pe­cially from heights), slips and mov­ing heavy items.</p>
