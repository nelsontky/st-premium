    <p>As op­ti­mism rises over the prom­ise of Covid-19 vac­cines, ex­perts have warned that even the best vac­cine will be no panacea alone and must be com­bined with ef­fec­tive treat­ments, as well as in­di­vid­ual re­spon­si­bil­ity, to re­duce the spread of the virus. The pan­demic is still in full force, with 15.4 mil­lion in­fected and more than 630,000 dead, lend­ing ur­gency in the race for a so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>As op­ti­mism rises over the prom­ise of Covid-19 vac­cines, ex­perts have warned that even the best vac­cine will be no panacea alone and must be com­bined with ef­fec­tive treat­ments, as well as in­di­vid­ual re­spon­si­bil­ity, to re­duce the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS’ emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, one of three ex­perts at a Straits Times Covid-19 we­bi­nar yes­ter­day, said: “At the end of the day, the con­trol of Covid isn’t go­ing to rely on vac­cines, it isn’t go­ing to rely on drugs, it isn’t go­ing to rely on mea­sures like so­cial dis­tanc­ing alone.</p>
    <p>“It’s prob­a­bly a com­bi­na­tion of ev­ery­thing that we can throw at this virus.”</p>
    <p>At­tract­ing over 1,000 par­tic­i­pants, the 11/ 2- hour ses­sion fo­cused on lessons learnt in six months of Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore and how these would shape the way for­ward in tack­ling the vi­ral dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, with 49,098 cases and 27 deaths, is in the midst of a cau­tious re­open­ing as the spread ap­pears to be un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the pan­demic is still in full force, with 15.4 mil­lion peo­ple in­fected, and more than 630,000 dead, lend­ing ur­gency in the race for a so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said there has been a lot of hype re­cently about pos­i­tive devel­op­ments in vac­cine re­search.</p>
    <p>With 130 can­di­dates, of which 24 are in clin­i­cal trial stages, Prof Fisher said it is eco­nom­i­cally lu­cra­tive for com­pa­nies to share pos­i­tive news about their work.</p>
    <p>But the truth is that there will not be a com­mer­cially vi­able vac­cine this year, and when one does be­come avail­able, there will not im­me­di­ately be enough for ev­ery­one, he warned. It is also un­likely that any vac­cine would fully pro­tect ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi, who leads a team work­ing on a vac­cine, said he would be sat­is­fied if it was 50 to 75 per cent ef­fec­tive. A 50 per cent ef­fi­cacy means only half of the peo­ple vac­ci­nated are ac­tu­ally pro­tected, and the rest could still be­come in­fected. Still, it would of­fer a suf­fi­cient level of pro­tec­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“Even a nat­u­ral in­fec­tion would not give you 100 per cent pro­tec­tion from a sec­ond in­fec­tion,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines gen­er­ally work bet­ter in young healthy peo­ple, and less well in those who are older or have un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions, but this may be good enough.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said: “If the young peo­ple are solidly im­mune, they would not pass the virus on to older peo­ple, even if (older peo­ple) are not im­mune or not vac­ci­nated.”</p>
    <p>Prof Fisher said hav­ing a vac­cine does not spell the end of the Covid-19 pan­demic. “Even af­ter the vac­cine comes, we’re still go­ing to have cases. We’re still go­ing to have lit­tle clus­ters. It’ll just be a lot eas­ier to man­age with the vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to be able to treat pa­tients, so most do not get se­verely ill or die, the panel noted.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic would be harder on some seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He said: “There will be some sec­tors that are be­ing force­fully kept shut to al­low the rest of the econ­omy to func­tion as per nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“How do you ex­plain this to peo­ple: that you have to lose your job so this other group of peo­ple can con­tinue work­ing and earn­ing a liv­ing? Coun­tries will have to put in place the nec­es­sary safe­guards to main­tain so­cial co­he­sion.”</p>
    <p>The ques­tions came fast and fu­ri­ous from par­tic­i­pants at The Straits Times Covid-19 we­bi­nar yes­ter­day, which marked six months since the coun­try’s first con­firmed case on Jan 23. More than 1,000 peo­ple signed up for the event, which fea­tured three ex­perts and was mod­er­ated by ST se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik. They an­swered a wide range of ques­tions, from when peo­ple could go on hol­i­day over­seas, to when a vac­cine would be avail­able.</p>
    <p>A Covid-19 vac­cine that is ef­fec­tive for just 50 per cent to 75 per cent of peo­ple should be good enough to keep the out­break in check here, if ev­ery­one is vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>In fact, 70 per cent ef­fi­cacy would be very good be­cause even re­cov­ery from the in­fec­tion will not give a pa­tient 100 per cent pro­tec­tion, said Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Whether Covid-19 gives you life­long pro­tec­tion or short-lived pro­tec­tion, that is some­thing that is be­ing de­bated.</p>
    <p>“Anec­do­tally, there is still that tiny mi­nor­ity that, de­spite hav­ing had a nat­u­ral in­fec­tion in the past, they go on to get it again.</p>
    <p>“Not ev­ery­one will have that, but that ba­si­cally tells you that there is no such thing as 100 per cent pro­tec­tion. So, hav­ing 70 per cent ac­tu­ally is good,” he said at a Covid-19 we­bi­nar hosted by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine that is 70 per cent ef­fec­tive means three out of 10 who re­ceive the vac­cine will still be sus­cep­ti­ble to the virus.</p>
    <p>But Prof Ooi said it would be good enough as vac­cines do not just work at the in­di­vid­ual level.</p>
    <p>Those who are pro­tected will also pro­tect oth­ers around them who are not im­mune sim­ply by not be­com­ing car­ri­ers, he pointed out, adding that this is the con­cept of herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, he ex­plained, one in­fected per­son will pass the virus to two or three peo­ple be­cause of the con­tacts they make in their daily lives.</p>
    <p>With phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing, these con­tacts are re­moved, so a per­son would pass the virus, on av­er­age, to fewer than one other per­son, and the out­break would die, he said.</p>
    <p>“Now, in a vac­ci­nated pop­u­la­tion, even if you don’t stop the so­cial con­tacts, one per­son will come in con­tact with three peo­ple and can po­ten­tially pass it on, but two of those peo­ple are al­ready im­mune, so you can only pass it on to one,” he added.</p>
    <p>“That would have a big im­pact on re­duc­ing the out­break and keep­ing it well be­low the kind of transmissi­on needed for the virus to cause these pan­demics.”</p>
    <p>Vac­cines are typ­i­cally more ef­fec­tive among young peo­ple, but Covid-19 tends to be more se­vere among older pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Asked if older peo­ple are more likely to re­main vul­ner­a­ble even af­ter be­ing vac­ci­nated, Prof Ooi said it would be good enough for the younger peo­ple to be “solidly im­mune” as they would then not pass the virus to seniors.</p>
    <p>Herd im­mu­nity is so ef­fec­tive that it has helped hu­man­ity erad­i­cate small­pox, Prof Ooi noted.</p>
    <p>“You just have to vac­ci­nate 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion and the virus will not have the chance of caus­ing epi­demics,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, how we keep measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and all that at bay so far is to keep a high level of our pop­u­la­tion vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>“Not 100 per cent, but about 95 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion is vac­ci­nated with the MMR vac­cine. The 95 per cent will pro­tect the re­main­ing 5 per cent.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, there­fore, does not need to have 100 per cent im­mu­nity to Covid-19 in its pop­u­la­tion, he said, adding that the coun­try just needs enough peo­ple to be im­mune to stop the virus from repli­cat­ing.</p>
    <p>“Given that this virus spreads from one per­son to three oth­ers, I sus­pect 50 per cent to about 75 per cent ef­fi­cacy, if we vac­ci­nate ev­ery­one, will be suf­fi­cient to com­pletely elim­i­nate out­breaks in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
