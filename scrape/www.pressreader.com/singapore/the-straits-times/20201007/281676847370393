    <p>Changi Air­port has set up a fa­cil­ity that al­lows it to swab up to 10,000 pas­sen­gers a day, as it pre­pares for the re­open­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders.</p>
    <p>This will be sup­ple­mented by a ded­i­cated Covid-19 test­ing lab­o­ra­tory at the air­port in the next few months, as part of mea­sures that Sin­ga­pore is tak­ing to re­open its bor­ders to in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing this yes­ter­day, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said test­ing is the key to un­lock­ing air travel.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus set to per­sist for some time, the emerg­ing in­ter­na­tional prac­tice is to test trav­ellers be­fore they board a plane, like how they have to go through se­cu­rity and bag checks, he noted in his min­is­te­rial state­ment.</p>
    <p>“With high-sen­si­tiv­ity tests, we can fil­ter out the virus at the bor­der, bet­ter still be­fore the trav­eller boards the plane, and sig­nif­i­cantly mit­i­gate the risk of im­port­ing and spread­ing the virus in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In other words, on a se­lec­tive ba­sis, we can open up our bor­der, do away with bor­der clo­sures and SHN (stay-home no­tice), which is a big de­ter­rent to travel, and re­place them with tests.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has rolled out dif­fer­ent mea­sures – from re­cip­ro­cal green lanes to uni­lat­er­ally open­ing its bor­ders – to boost its avi­a­tion sec­tor, which has been bat­tered by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The in­creased em­pha­sis on tests for air trav­ellers will be sup­ported by a cor­re­spond­ing in­crease in Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said test­ing ca­pac­ity is no longer a ma­jor con­straint, with Sin­ga­pore now test­ing more than 27,000 peo­ple daily us­ing swab tests.</p>
    <p>It is also on track to con­duct more than 40,000 tests a day by next month.</p>
    <p>This is in con­trast to the 2,000 tests daily that it was able to con­duct back in March.</p>
    <p>To give such ef­forts a fur­ther boost, the coun­try will tap the pri­vate sec­tor to de­velop com­mer­cial test­ing ca­pac­ity, Mr Ong added.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, test­ing tech­nol­ogy is ad­vanc­ing. There are promis­ing tests with quicker turn­arounds while main­tain­ing ac­cept­able test sen­si­tiv­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>He cited how DSO Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries and the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search have de­vel­oped a test kit that halves the time needed to process and an­a­lyse pa­tient sam­ples to be­tween one and 1.5 hours.</p>
    <p>There are also tri­als for less in­tru­sive tests us­ing deep throat saliva and work to de­velop rapid test kits that can show re­sults on the spot. These tests, which in­clude breathal­yser tests, will be de­ployed “where prac­ti­ca­ble”, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try group In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion said yes­ter­day that it wel­comes Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to use Covid-19 test­ing in place of quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>It said a sur­vey it con­ducted re­cently showed that 88 per cent of trav­ellers were will­ing to take Covid-19 tests in or­der to travel. Con­versely, 83 per cent of trav­ellers said they would not travel if there is a chance they might be quar­an­tined at their des­ti­na­tion.</p>
