    <p>Seven years ago, dur­ing a term break, Mr Sa­muel Lim took on a job lo­cated near Ou­tram Park MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>On his train trips, the then de­sign com­mu­ni­ca­tion stu­dent at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts no­ticed that com­muters trans­fer­ring to an­other line would take an es­ca­la­tor up, only to re­alise it led them out of the sta­tion.</p>
    <p>That was the start of his jour­ney to re­design MRT sta­tion signs.</p>
    <p>But what be­gan as a fi­nal-year project for school be­came real-life work for Mr Lim, whose ideas were no­ticed by the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA).</p>
    <p>He joined the agency in Au­gust 2015 and spent five years in the sig­nage team in its ar­chi­tec­ture di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The new MRT sig­nage fea­tur­ing his team’s work was un­veiled at the first three sta­tions on the</p>
    <p>Thom­son-East Coast Line that opened this year – Wood­lands North, Wood­lands and Wood­lands South.</p>
    <p>After the re­design, the sta­tions’ signs are neater with less clut­ter, exit codes are in yel­low, icons are more user-friendly, and a new map of the MRT net­work is in place.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, 29, said the con­fu­sion he wit­nessed at Ou­tram Park sta­tion is just one ex­am­ple of how de­sign can in­flu­ence de­ci­sion-mak­ing and im­pact peo­ple’s lives.</p>
    <p>The same sign tells com­muters to turn left to exit or go straight to con­nect to the North East Line, and he said most peo­ple get con­fused or take a while to process the in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>One prob­lem was that the signs were too wordy, said Mr Lim, who moved last month to the Pub­lic Ser­vice Di­vi­sion’s In­no­va­tion Lab to take on a new role as de­sign lead.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­pos­si­ble to fit so many land­marks on signs be­cause peo­ple are look­ing for dif­fer­ent places. So as more re­quests from the pub­lic come in, you’ll see pa­per signs</p>
    <p>all around the sta­tions.”</p>
    <p>For sev­eral months when he was in school, he would take the train al­most daily, observe com­muters, and hop on and off at dif­fer­ent sta­tions.</p>
    <p>He would also fo­cus on more com­plex sta­tions like Dhoby Ghaut, which he vis­ited more than 20 times for re­search. “I was work­ing on the project as if it was a real sys­tem. It couldn’t just be con­cep­tual, I needed to back up ev­ery pro­posed change,” he said.</p>
    <p>The first step was to break up the clut­ter of text and cat­e­gorise the pur­pose of dif­fer­ent signs – to in­form, di­rect and con­firm.</p>
    <p>This means that in­for­ma­tive signs could have more text, but peo­ple look for other signs to get di­rec­tions quickly. The last type of sign con­firms that peo­ple have taken the right route.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that di­rec­tion signs are eas­ier to follow, Mr Lim used more icons in­stead of text. If peo­ple need more in­for­ma­tion,</p>
    <p>they can re­fer to a board at the side us­ing the icons.</p>
    <p>“The idea is that we min­imise the text on top. Then we con­sol­i­date the ad­di­tional in­for­ma­tion at the bot­tom or the side,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other change is that numbers are used for the ex­its, in place of let­ters.</p>
    <p>“Numbers are more uni­ver­sal, whereas let­ters are not – you don’t have the equiv­a­lent of A or B in Chi­nese,” said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>“Also, at one glance, you can see, for in­stance, that this sta­tion has seven ex­its. It tells you how big or small the sta­tion is.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also played around with colours – yel­low worked best as it had not yet been used on any MRT line, and the colour also stood out.</p>
    <p>He also had a hand in the new MRT net­work map that was launched last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Swee Lin, LTA’s stu­dio head of ar­chi­tec­ture un­der the In­fra­struc­ture De­sign and Engi­neer­ing Group, said: “When Sa­muel joined LTA, he was young and fresh, and brought a lot of new ideas with him.</p>
    <p>“In the five years he was with us, Sa­muel rewrote the Tran­sit Sig­nage Man­ual, stan­dard­ised the graph­ics, se­lected a new font... all to im­prove the leg­i­bil­ity of the sig­nage in tran­sit fa­cil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>LTA has not con­firmed when or whether ex­ist­ing sig­nage will be re­placed with the new de­signs.</p>
