    <p>At the new Cheers con­ve­nience store in Our Tampines Hub, you can walk in, grab the items you need and walk out with­out hav­ing to whip out your phone, credit card or cash to make pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Thanks to an ad­vanced ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) sys­tem in the out­let that tracks cus­tomers’ ac­tions, items re­moved from shelves are recorded au­to­mat­i­cally and fa­cial recog­ni­tion tech­nol­ogy is used for pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­fore en­ter­ing the store for the first time, cus­tomers must down­load the Cheers SG app and add their Visa ac­count as their mode of pay­ment. They can use the fa­cial recog­ni­tion tech­nol­ogy in the app or scan a unique QR code to en­ter the store.</p>
    <p>As the AI sys­tem in the store and the app are linked, the app will au­to­mat­i­cally record the items that cus­tomers pick up in a vir­tual shop­ping cart. As they walk out of the store, the items will be charged to their Visa cards.</p>
    <p>Cam­eras dot the store’s ceil­ing, and the AI el­e­ment that tracks hu­man be­hav­iour can de­tect theft.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if some­one opens a can of soda, drinks from it, and re­turns it to the shelf, the all-watch­ing AI sys­tem will block him from en­ter­ing the store the next time.</p>
    <p>The novel un­manned store was launched by Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Over the next two to three months, only cus­tomers with Visa ac­counts can pa­tro­n­ise the 24-hour store. Other pay­ment meth­ods such as DBS PayLah! and credit cards from other banks will be added to the app.</p>
    <p>Cheers is a sub­sidiary of su­per­mar­ket chain FairPrice.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos, the MP for the Tampines West ward of Tampines</p>
    <p>GRC, said that mov­ing to­wards AIpow­ered, un­manned stores is the way to go as this is aligned with the coun­try’s Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tive and helps to man­age man­power con­straints in the re­tail sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“The store’s tech­nol­ogy al­lows FairPrice to ex­pand its Cheers out­lets to many places very quickly, with­out the con­straints of man­power, es­pe­cially at night, when it is very hard to find work­ers who are able to do shift duty,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Cheers SG app can also regis­ter more than one per­son, mean­ing chil­dren and the el­derly who</p>
    <p>do not have a smart­phone or credit card can still en­ter the store and buy items, as long as their fam­ily mem­ber’s app has their fa­cial bio­met­rics recorded. The items will be charged to their fam­ily mem­ber’s credit card reg­is­tered to the app.</p>
    <p>The store is pi­lot­ing the new AI sys­tem, and if the tech­nol­ogy and app prove suc­cess­ful, the sys­tem may be rolled out to other Cheers out­lets in the fu­ture, said Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of FairPrice Group.</p>
