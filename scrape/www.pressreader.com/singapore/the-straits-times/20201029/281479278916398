    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is likely to take longer to re­cover from the Covid-19 cri­sis than it did in past re­ces­sions, the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Part of the rea­son is a drop in earn­ings for busi­nesses and lower in­comes for house­holds. Cou­pled with greater un­cer­tainty, these re­strain spend­ing and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the pace of re­cov­ery is ex­pected to mod­er­ate in the quar­ters ahead, the cen­tral bank added in its twice-yearly macroe­co­nomic re­view re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some pock­ets of the econ­omy are not ex­pected to re­cover to pre-pan­demic lev­els even by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the travel-re­lated sec­tor and some con­tact-in­ten­sive do­mes­tic ser­vices as ex­am­ples, MAS said that ac­tiv­ity “could still fall short of pre-pan­demic lev­els un­til health risks abate”.</p>
    <p>It fur­ther ex­pects em­ploy­ment re­cov­ery to be un­even and slow.</p>
    <p>On the jobs front, the un­em­ploy­ment rate among Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents is likely to re­main high next year, keep­ing wage growth low. This is un­like dur­ing the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when the rate re­turned to pre-cri­sis lev­els af­ter six quar­ters.</p>
    <p>In its re­port, MAS noted the Covid-19 pan­demic has dis­pro­por­tion­ately hurt do­mes­tic-ori­ented and travel-re­lated ser­vices, such as food and bev­er­age, re­tail, con­struc­tion, avi­a­tion and hos­pi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>As these sec­tors have stronger in­ter­link­ages with lo­cal firms and house­holds, there has been a more se­vere im­pact lo­cally, es­pe­cially on jobs and con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions were typ­i­cally driven by the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which is ex­ter­nally ori­ented.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the pace of re­cov­ery could be af­fected by a resur­gence in Covid-19 in­fec­tions world­wide, caus­ing more shut­downs and weaker ex­ter­nal de­mand that would worsen con­di­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The path ahead re­mains clouded with un­cer­tainty,” said MAS.</p>
    <p>It re­it­er­ated the Gov­ern­ment’s fore­cast for the econ­omy to shrink by a record 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year. Next year, the econ­omy is ex­pected to post growth that is higher than the av­er­age in the past sev­eral years, but that is be­cause of the ef­fects of the low base this year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy shrunk by a his­toric all-time low in the sec­ond quar­ter as a re­sult of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, but growth re­bounded in the third quar­ter mainly due to the eas­ing of some curbs on move­ment.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) in the sec­ond quar­ter con­tracted by 13.2 per cent on a quar­ter-on-quar­ter sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis. Us­ing the same mea­sure, the third quar­ter re­bound saw the econ­omy ex­pand by 7.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>While some sec­tors, mainly ex­port-driven man­u­fac­tur­ing, have seen a pickup, over­all out­put is still some 7 per cent be­low pre-Covid-19 lev­els, MAS noted.</p>
    <p>The third-quar­ter re­bound was also fu­elled by the Gov­ern­ment’s bud­getary sup­port mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But the fis­cal boost is likely to lessen later this year even though some mea­sures, like the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, will con­tinue – al­beit at lower lev­els of sup­port.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the un­prece­dented in­ten­sity of the Covid-19 re­ces­sion, MAS said it re­sulted in a cu­mu­la­tive 14 per cent drop in GDP from pre-cri­sis lev­els to the trough in the mid­dle of this year. This com­pares with an av­er­age con­trac­tion of 6.1 per cent in the pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>As for global re­cov­ery, MAS ex­pects the near-term re­bound – sup­ported by un­prece­dented fis­cal and mon­e­tary poli­cies – to fade.</p>
    <p>Global GDP is pro­jected to shrink by 3.9 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Next year, the world econ­omy is fore­cast to grow by 6.2 per cent but that will still be about 4 per cent be­low the level pro­jected be­fore the Covid-19 shock.</p>
    <p>Longer-term re­cov­ery will be pro­tracted as ac­tiv­ity in the travel-re­lated sec­tor is ex­pected to be weak for an ex­tended pe­riod, lead­ing to spillovers to the rest of the econ­omy that will weigh on the over­all labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>These in­clude land trans­port op­er­a­tors such as taxi and pri­vate-hire car ser­vices, which have likely seen a size­able short­fall in in­come due to the lack of in­bound leisure and busi­ness trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>The road to re­cov­ery for the labour mar­ket is likely to be slow and un­even, with res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rates tak­ing a longer time to reach pre-cri­sis lev­els com­pared to dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, said the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>In its re­view of the macroe­co­nomic sit­u­a­tion re­leased yes­ter­day, MAS said the un­em­ploy­ment rate of Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents is ex­pected to de­crease grad­u­ally next year af­ter peak­ing in the sec­ond half of this year, but will re­main el­e­vated over­all.</p>
    <p>It added that this will weigh on wages for the rest of this year and pos­si­bly into next year.</p>
    <p>These pro­jec­tions for the labour mar­ket are de­spite em­ploy­ment prospects look­ing up in the im­me­di­ate term in the re­tail and food and bev­er­age sec­tors, and in sup­port ser­vices such as clean­ing and se­cu­rity in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>These busi­ness ar­eas re­bounded quickly with Sin­ga­pore ex­it­ing the cir­cuit breaker in June, said MAS.</p>
    <p>In con­struc­tion, the grad­ual re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties in the sec­ond half of this year would also likely lead to more hir­ing.</p>
    <p>As for the travel-re­lated sec­tor, MAS said some mod­est em­ploy­ment re­cov­ery can be ex­pected with the eas­ing of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and, in par­tic­u­lar, the re­sump­tion of meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) events and some cruise op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, longer-term re­cov­ery will be pro­tracted as ac­tiv­ity in the travel-re­lated sec­tor is ex­pected to be weak for an ex­tended pe­riod, lead­ing to spillovers to the rest of the econ­omy that will weigh on the over­all labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>These in­clude land trans­port op­er­a­tors such as taxi and pri­vate­hire car ser­vices, which have likely seen a size­able short­fall in in­come due to the lack of in­bound leisure and busi­ness trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>MAS noted that Covid-19 has also led to changes in con­sump­tion pat­terns, which could dampen labour de­mand. For ex­am­ple, work­ing from home could be­come more preva­lent, re­duc­ing de­mand for trans­porta­tion ser­vices as well as so­cial and recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tain macroe­co­nomic out­look will also hold back over­all labour mar­ket prospects, as ac­tiv­ity in many sec­tors could be weaker than ex­pected with fur­ther bal­ance sheet strains, said MAS.</p>
    <p>This is likely so even in bet­ter-per­form­ing in­dus­tries as firms may have brought for­ward hir­ing, en­cour­aged by tem­po­rary gov­ern­ment in­cen­tives such as the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI).</p>
    <p>Partly due to such in­cen­tives and wage sub­si­dies that sup­port the hir­ing of lo­cals, lo­cal em­ploy­ment is ex­pected to re­bound more strongly.</p>
    <p>The ex­tended Jobs Sup­port Scheme, al­beit at re­duced lev­els, as well as the newly in­tro­duced JGI, should also en­cour­age the cre­ation of new jobs in sec­tors that have brighter prospects, such as in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, biomed­i­cal sciences, e-com­merce, health and so­cial ser­vices, and fi­nan­cial and in­sur­ance ser­vices, MAS added. How­ever, the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate will likely take a longer time to re­cover than dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, it said.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents who were pre­vi­ously dis­cour­aged from seek­ing em­ploy­ment could re-en­ter the labour force as the econ­omy re­cov­ers, and in­di­vid­u­als un­der the SGUnited train­ing pro­grammes could add to the num­ber of un­em­ployed work­ers when look­ing for jobs.</p>
    <p>Skills mis­matches could also ham­per hir­ing, as Covid-19 is likely to ac­cel­er­ate the de­cline of low- and mid-skill ser­vice jobs, which are be­ing re­placed by less labour-in­ten­sive, au­to­mated pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>More jobs are ex­pected mainly in modern ser­vice sec­tors, which in­clude firms that pro­vide pro­fes­sional, fi­nan­cial and tech­nol­ogy ser­vices such as cy­ber se­cu­rity and bank­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“These emer­gent skills mis­matches be­tween ex­cess labour sup­ply and new labour de­mand may in­crease search fric­tions and im­pede labour mar­ket re-al­lo­ca­tion,” said MAS.</p>
