    <p>A man was shot and killed on Saturday as a large group of sup­port­ers of US Pres­i­dent Donald Trump trav­elled in a car­a­van through down­town Port­land, Ore­gon, which has seen nightly protests for three con­sec­u­tive months. The pro-Trump rally drew hun­dreds of trucks full of sup­port­ers into the city.</p>
    <p>PORT­LAND • A man was shot and killed on Saturday as a large group of sup­port­ers of United States Pres­i­dent Donald Trump trav­elled in a car­a­van through down­town Port­land, Ore­gon, which has seen nightly protests for three con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>The pro-Trump rally drew hun­dreds of trucks full of sup­port­ers into the city.</p>
    <p>At times, Trump sup­port­ers and counter-pro­test­ers clashed on the streets, with peo­ple shoot­ing with paint­ball guns from the beds of pickup trucks and pro­test­ers throw­ing ob­jects back at them.</p>
    <p>A video that pur­ports to be of the shoot­ing, taken from the far side of the street, shows a small group of peo­ple in the road out­side what ap­pears to be a park­ing garage. Gun­fire erupts, and a man col­lapses in the street.</p>
    <p>The man who was shot and killed was wear­ing a hat with the in­signia of Pa­triot Prayer, a far-right group based in Port­land that has clashed with pro­test­ers in the past.</p>
    <p>The Port­land Po­lice Bureau said that of­fi­cers heard re­ports of gun­fire shortly be­fore 9pm and found a vic­tim with a gun­shot wound to the chest. It was de­ter­mined that the vic­tim had died.</p>
    <p>At the scene, po­lice of­fi­cers blocked off the road, and medics at­tended to a per­son who ap­peared to have a chest wound.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ing capped a volatile week in the US that be­gan when the po­lice in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, re­peat­edly shot a black man, Mr Ja­cob Blake, prompt­ing new protests against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity that in­cluded the can­cel­la­tion of pro­fes­sional sports games.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the un­rest af­ter the shoot­ing of Mr Blake, Kyle Rit­ten­house, a 17-year-old Illi­nois res­i­dent, was charged in con­nec­tion with the fa­tal shoot­ings of two pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Port­land has seen nightly demon­stra­tions since the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, also a black man, in po­lice cus­tody in Min­neapo­lis in May.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, right-wing demon­stra­tions have also sprung up in the city, and Mr Trump has re­peat­edly high­lighted the un­rest in Port­land as ev­i­dence of the need for a tougher law-and-or­der re­sponse to the chaotic protests over po­lice vi­o­lence and racial in­jus­tice that have swept through many Amer­i­can cities.</p>
    <p>The Trump sup­port­ers gath­ered ear­lier on Saturday in the sub­urbs and plot­ted a route for the sev­eral hun­dred ve­hi­cles in­volved in the event that would have kept them on the high­ways out­side the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>But some of the pro­test­ers headed di­rectly down­town, where counter-pro­test­ers con­fronted some of the ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Some of the con­flicts led to fist­fights. In one en­counter, some­one drove over a bike, draw­ing the po­lice to the scene.</p>
    <p>While protests in Port­land have per­sisted, their num­bers have changed over time. The nightly events be­gan with mass ral­lies af­ter Mr Floyd’s death, then shrank to smaller num­bers of peo­ple who re­peat­edly clashed with the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Last month, when the fed­eral govern­ment sent cam­ou­flaged agents into the city, the protest num­bers grew dra­mat­i­cally once again.</p>
    <p>In more re­cent days, the protest crowd has typ­i­cally num­bered just a few hun­dred peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Trump will travel this week to Kenosha, the White House said on Saturday. He will meet po­lice in the Wis­con­sin city to­mor­row and “sur­vey dam­age from re­cent riots” trig­gered by Mr Blake’s shoot­ing the pre­vi­ous week­end, ad­min­is­tra­tion spokesman Judd Deere said.</p>
    <p>Mr Blake took at least half a dozen shots in the back in front of his small chil­dren as he leaned into his car, in an in­ci­dent that trig­gered an out­pour­ing of anger over yet an­other shoot­ing of a black man by white po­lice.</p>
