    <p>Yuen Sin</p>
    <p>From lock­ing re­sale gains in Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund ac­counts to re­mov­ing open mar­ket trans­ac­tions to build­ing smaller flats, there is no short­age of po­ten­tial pol­icy ma­noeu­vres to en­sure pub­lic hous­ing – par­tic­u­larly in new, prime lo­ca­tions – stays af­ford­able for ev­ery Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>But aca­demics and real es­tate ex­perts said that while the Gov­ern­ment can de­cree the mix of hous­ing type with rel­a­tive ease, tack­ling the sig­nif­i­cant profits home own­ers could glean from sell­ing a Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flat in a prime lo­ca­tion is an­other beast al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee said pub­lic hous­ing will be kept in­clu­sive, and the likes of two-room and rental flats for the low-in­come group would be de­lib­er­ately in­jected into up­com­ing ar­eas, like the city cen­tre or the Greater South­ern Wa­ter­front.</p>
    <p>In his Face­book post, he also said the Gov­ern­ment was con­sid­er­ing ad­di­tional sub­si­dies for up­com­ing BTO flats in such prime lo­ca­tions, in view of higher price points.</p>
    <p>But it was study­ing re­stricted re­sale con­di­tions for such flats as well. Mr Lee de­scribed it as an “is­sue of fair­ness”, where these ad­di­tional sub­si­dies add to higher cap­i­tal gains for the buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Con­sider the down­town Pin­na­cle@Dux­ton project. In 2015, the first flat in the devel­op­ment sold on the re­sale mar­ket went for $900,000, in con­trast to its $340,000 launch price. Some units at SkyTer­race@Daw­son, in the ma­ture es­tate of Queen­stown, fetched just over $1 mil­lion at the end of their min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod (MOP) ear­lier this year – up from orig­i­nal pur­chase prices of around $530,000.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said Hous­ing Board flats, a pub­lic good sub­sidised by pub­lic funds, should not gen­er­ate re­sale profits to “wind­fall” lev­els.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of sky-high profits is ex­ac­er­bated by how the low-in­come group is ex­cluded by bar­ri­ers to en­try in prime lo­ca­tions, such as high prices for BTO flats there.</p>
    <p>But the an­a­lysts are split on how to deal with the sin­gu­lar premise of a prop­erty pur­chase – lo­ca­tion, lo­ca­tion, lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>For as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of eco­nomics at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences (SUSS) Wal­ter Th­e­seira, the prac­ti­cal so­lu­tion is to “do a bit of ev­ery­thing”, by mix­ing hous­ing types and po­ten­tially tenures. “There is lim­ited land sup­ply in prime ar­eas, and tremen­dous de­mand for liv­ing there. So the mar­ket price is high,” he said. “You can man­age this by low­er­ing the ef­fec­tive value of the hous­ing of­fered.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, this can be done by build­ing smaller flats, which use less land, or by re­duc­ing the length</p>
    <p>of leases.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Ms Chris­tine Sun, OrangeTee & Tie’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy, said any ad­di­tional sub­si­dies should be means-tested, with the lower-in­come group re­ceiv­ing more for the same-sized flat.</p>
    <p>She also sug­gested that prices of new prime area flats could be pegged to ex­ist­ing units in lo­cales like Kal­lang/Wham­poa or Bi­dadari, not­ing that it is now the norm to pay around $500,000 to $600,000 for a new four-room flat there.</p>
    <p>While that may re­solve the is­sue of keep­ing it af­ford­able for the first owner, it does not tackle the other prob­lem – the sig­nif­i­cant profit that can be made when the flat hits its MOP, which is cur­rently five years.</p>
    <p>“When we talk to our agents on the ground, they said that even if the MOP is in­creased to 10 years, peo­ple will still be will­ing to wait and pay a high price, so these flats in prime ar­eas may still be able to fetch more than $1 mil­lion,” said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Leong Chan-Hoong, also of SUSS, ar­gued that the Gov­ern­ment can draw a line to ex­clude cer­tain buy­ers.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the Mar­ried Child Pri­or­ity Scheme should not be ap­pli­ca­ble to flats in prime ar­eas, he sug­gested. Oth­er­wise, those from more af­flu­ent back­grounds whose fam­ily mem­bers are al­ready liv­ing in such ar­eas can tap the scheme to boost their chances of se­cur­ing flats in cov­eted lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, up to 30 per cent of BTO and Sale of Bal­ance flats are set aside for first-timers ap­ply­ing through the scheme, which helps mar­ried cou­ples and their par­ents live near one an­other.</p>
    <p>Prof Th­e­seira said one way to en­sure HDB sub­si­dies do not re­sult in out­sized gains is to have more re­stric­tive con­di­tions tied to the ex­tent of the sub­sidy.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, if HDB pro­vides a 50 per cent sub­sidy in re­turn for a 50 per cent equity stake, the home owner would only cap­ture half of the gains from ap­pre­ci­a­tion, or half the loss from a value re­duc­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun sug­gested man­dat­ing flats in prime ar­eas be resold to HDB in­stead of through the open mar­ket. The prices can be pegged to pre­vail­ing mar­ket rates.</p>
    <p>Such a pol­icy is al­ready in play in some form, with Sin­ga­pore’s first as­sisted liv­ing flats in Bukit Ba­tok to be launched in Fe­bru­ary. These can­not be resold or rented out, and own­ers who no longer need the</p>
    <p>flat can re­turn it to HDB, which will re­fund the value of the re­main­ing lease to them.</p>
    <p>“If peo­ple re­alise there’s a pos­si­bil­ity their flats will have to be sold back to the Gov­ern­ment, it is pos­si­ble this will al­low the Gov­ern­ment to gain bet­ter con­trol of mar­ket pric­ing,” she noted. The flats could be sold again by HDB on the open mar­ket, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>This leads to a host of other ques­tions: How much is too much profit and who de­fines it? To com­pli­cate mat­ters, some es­tates out­side prime lo­ca­tions may be pop­u­lar for its prox­im­ity to pop­u­lar schools or wa­ter­ways. Should the same prin­ci­ple be ap­plied to all flats?</p>
    <p>Dr Lee Nai Jia, deputy di­rec­tor of the In­sti­tute of Real Es­tate and Ur­ban Stud­ies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, pro­posed chan­nelling re­sale profits into the Spe­cial Ac­count of one’s CPF</p>
    <p>sav­ings, which is meant for old age and re­tire­ment-re­lated needs.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of hav­ing gains go to a bank ac­count where they can use it to spend on a big­ger house or in­vest in stocks or real es­tate, it could go into fi­nanc­ing health­care needs – be­cause we know that in fu­ture, med­i­cal costs will prob­a­bly go up,” said Dr Lee, who rec­om­mended that thresh­olds be set where re­turns ex­ceed in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>“Al­ter­na­tively, put it into some­thing sim­i­lar which can be drawn down only for chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion, for ex­am­ple.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, monies drawn out of the CPF Or­di­nary Ac­count have to be re­turned to the home owner’s CPF sav­ings, along with ac­crued in­ter­est and grants, when the sub­sidised flat is sold.</p>
    <p>But is the is­sue of CPF monies moot when the flat is pur­chased with cash and a bank loan?</p>
    <p>The nub of the mat­ter is that</p>
    <p>first-time HDB home own­ers feel en­ti­tled to make a profit off a sub­sidised flat, more so if it is in a prime lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Since BTO flats in pop­u­lar lo­ca­tions are of­ten over­sub­scribed by many times, there is an el­e­ment of luck as well – most peo­ple have a shot at scal­ing the prop­erty lad­der.</p>
    <p>But there is a real risk of exclusive en­claves form­ing, and a pub­lic prop­erty bub­ble. It was re­cently re­vealed that the num­ber of re­sale flats sold for at least $1 mil­lion each had hit a new high, with 72 sold from Jan­uary to last month com­pared with 64 for all of last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee noted that ap­ply­ing any new mea­sures in up­com­ing prime es­tates could draw the ire of those who still feel en­ti­tled to profit off their flats. “The Gov­ern­ment could face pres­sure and some po­lit­i­cal costs, but I think they will make the right de­ci­sions for the com­mu­nity and so­ci­ety.”</p>
