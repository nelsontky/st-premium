    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Long-haul, low­cost car­rier AirAsia X has run out of money and needs to raise up to RM500 mil­lion (S$164 mil­lion) to restart the air­line, deputy chair­man Lim Kian Onn said in a news­pa­per interview pub­lished yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian air­line, the long­haul arm of AirAsia Group, said this month that it wanted to re­struc­ture RM63.5 bil­lion of debt and slash its share cap­i­tal by 90 per cent to con­tinue as a go­ing con­cern.</p>
    <p>“We have run out of money,” Mr Lim told The Star news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, banks will not fi­nance the com­pany without share­hold­ers, both old and new, putting in fresh eq­uity. So, a pre­req­ui­site is fresh eq­uity.”</p>
    <p>He said the air­line had ac­tual li­a­bil­i­ties of RM2 bil­lion, with the larger fig­ure of RM63.5 bil­lion in­clud­ing all lease pay­ments for the next eight to 10 years, as well as its large or­der for Air­bus planes and con­tracted en­gine main­te­nance with Rolls-Royce Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>“If we find RM300 mil­lion in new eq­uity, then the share­holder funds are RM300 mil­lion at the restart of busi­ness, and if we are able to bor­row RM200 mil­lion, we feel that we will have a good plat­form to start all over again.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said AirAsia X also needed to con­vince its lessors of its busi­ness plan, adding that an un­named lessor had re­cently taken back one of the air­line’s planes to con­vert it into a freighter.</p>
    <p>The air­line plans to liq­ui­date its small In­done­sia-based car­rier and has com­pletely writ­ten down its stake in Thai AirAsia X in its books, with the Thai car­rier not part of the re­struc­tur­ing scheme, Mr Lim told the news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Ri­val Malaysia Air­lines is also in fi­nan­cial trou­ble, but Mr Lim said there would be “no good out­come” from seek­ing to merge two air­lines in dire straits.</p>
    <p>AirAsia X de­clined to com­ment be­yond the de­tails pub­lished in the news­pa­per ar­ti­cle.</p>
