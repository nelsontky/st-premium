    <p>Be­ing a bus driver is a thank­less job and I agree with Trans­port</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung that we should ap­pre­ci­ate their work (Covid-19 no ex­cuse to abuse bus driv­ers: Ong Ye Kung, ST On­line, Aug 23).</p>
    <p>As an early riser, I’m used to see­ing pub­lic buses on the road be­fore 4am. I came to know that these buses ferry bus driv­ers to the in­ter­change for them to start their morn­ing shift.</p>
    <p>There are more than 5,000 pub­lic buses cur­rently in op­er­a­tion. In­deed, this is a tir­ing job hav­ing to meet the in­ces­sant de­mands of commuters.</p>
    <p>Given that their job in­volves driv­ing for hours on our con­gested roads and deal­ing with the gen­eral pub­lic, the least we can do is to say hello to them when we board or re­turn their greet­ings, while a word of thanks can bring a smile to the driver’s face and make the jour­ney more pleas­ant.</p>
    <p>Bus driv­ers are gen­er­ally cheer­ful, friendly and help­ful.</p>
    <p>Al­though there is an ap­pre­ci­a­tion day held ev­ery year for pub­lic trans­port work­ers, this is in­suf­fi­cient if commuters who treat these work­ers badly and with­out re­spect don’t change their mind­set.</p>
    <p>Our ded­i­cated bus driv­ers face many pres­sures. Commuters should say hello to the driver ev­ery time they board a bus and thank them when they ar­rive at their des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Bus driv­ers take pride in their job and are com­mit­ted to get­ting peo­ple to where they need to go safely.</p>
    <p>But the driv­ers also need to be able to do their job safely with­out hav­ing to put up with bad be­hav­iour. A lit­tle re­spect goes a long way.</p>
    <p>The new Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment has reaf­firmed the Govern­ment’s com­mit­ment to pub­lic clean­li­ness in Sin­ga­pore (Keep­ing S’pore clean a pri­or­ity, says Grace Fu, Aug 22).</p>
    <p>What we need is a cam­paign that would make it sec­ond na­ture for all Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents to keep the coun­try clean, safe and green.</p>
    <p>Let’s make ours a so­ci­ety of lit­ter pick­ers, and not leave it to the army of for­eign work­ers to clean up all the time.</p>
    <p>Make all stu­dents, civil ser­vants, of­fice work­ers, for­eign work­ers, new cit­i­zens, and so on, take part in a “Pick lit­ter in your neigh­bour­hood week”.</p>
    <p>Make it a reg­u­lar ex­er­cise that in­volves all govern­ment agen­cies and pri­vate sec­tor or­gan­i­sa­tions. Cou­pled with heavy fines and strict en­force­ment against lit­ter­ing, in time to come, we will see a so­ci­ety that is con­scious of main­tain­ing good so­cial habits, with peo­ple will­ing to speak up and ed­u­cate oth­ers when they en­counter anti-so­cial be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>With one third of our pop­u­la­tion com­ing from other coun­tries, who bring their own habits and cul­tures with them, we should have heavy penal­ties for re­cal­ci­trant of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>This will show those who do not want to ob­serve our rules and reg­u­la­tions that we mean busi­ness, sim­i­lar to re­cent tough penal­ties meted out to for­eign­ers who flouted the cir­cuit breaker rules.</p>
    <p>When it be­comes sec­ond na­ture for peo­ple to dis­pose of lit­ter prop­erly and clean up af­ter them­selves, pub­lic hy­giene stan­dards will def­i­nitely be raised to an ac­cept­able level, and our en­vi­ron­ment will be safe and green for all. It will also re­duce our de­pen­dence on for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>Let’s make ours a so­ci­ety of lit­ter pick­ers, and not leave it to the army of for­eign work­ers to clean up all the time.</p>
