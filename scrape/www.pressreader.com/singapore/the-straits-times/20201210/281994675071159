    <p>Mr Zhao Li­jian thrives on con­tro­versy. Ag­gres­sive pro­mo­tion of China’s in­ter­ests is ex­pected for a for­eign min­istry spokesman, but Mr Zhao has pi­o­neered an ex­treme ap­proach by be­com­ing a pop­ulist provocateu­r who owes his ca­reer to a will­ing­ness to shock, nee­dle and troll Bei­jing’s crit­ics on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>For Bei­jing, he has crys­tallised a model for diplo­macy with a jagged edge and driven the shift away from an older gen­er­a­tion of more con­ser­va­tive and re­strained en­gage­ment, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>The diplo­matic furore that Mr Zhao set off last week, when he tweeted a com­puter-gen­er­ated im­age of an Aus­tralian sol­dier hold­ing a bloody knife to the throat of an Afghan child, was the lat­est in a string of in­cen­di­ary in­ci­dents that de­light Chi­nese na­tion­al­ists.</p>
    <p>In a sign of ac­cep­tance of Mr Zhao’s tac­tics, the Chi­nese</p>
    <p>Academy of So­cial Sciences, a think-tank that re­ports to China’s State Coun­cil, in May re­leased a se­ries of strat­egy doc­u­ments on the need to “strengthen China’s abil­ity to fight for in­ter­na­tional pub­lic opin­ion”.</p>
    <p>It said China had to “counter-at­tack” against crit­ics on Twit­ter, Face­book and YouTube, all of which are blocked in main­land China.</p>
    <p>As China’s most high-pro­file of­fi­cial on Twit­ter, with nearly 860,000 fol­low­ers, Mr Zhao, 48, has built a per­sonal brand that is rare for a for­eign min­istry spokesman.</p>
    <p>A po­si­tion of mid­dling power in the Chi­nese bu­reau­cracy, spokes­men had typ­i­cally con­fined them­selves to scripted re­it­er­a­tion of Bei­jing’s stance and the oc­ca­sional out­burst over is­sues such as the South China Sea or Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“His­tor­i­cally, there was quite a lot of crit­i­cism (within China) of the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs for be­ing too will­ing to com­pro­mise or even lack­ing in back­bone,” said Pro­fes­sor Yang Dali of the Univer­sity of Chicago.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao’s eager­ness to push bound­aries has oc­ca­sion­ally sparked re­sis­tance in China’s for­eign pol­icy es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>When he backed a con­spir­acy the­ory in March that the United States army could have brought the virus to Wuhan dur­ing the Mil­i­tary World Games, it was fol­lowed by a flurry of state­ments from se­nior diplo­mats, in­clud­ing Mr Fu Ying, deputy chair­man of the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress For­eign Af­fairs Com­mit­tee, call­ing for re­straint in diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>But these dif­fer­ences prob­a­bly re­flect con­trast­ing styles among diplo­mats rather than a sub­stan­tive dis­agree­ment, said Mr Yang.</p>
    <p>“Over­all (the young gen­er­a­tion’s) hard-line stance and abil­ity to have such in­flu­ence on the global dis­course means they clearly en­joy sup­port within the Chi­nese lead­er­ship,” he said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has done away with China’s pol­icy to “bide its time and hide its strength”, in­stead call­ing for Bei­jing to be more as­sertive in spread­ing its mes­sage.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, the For­eign Min­istry has raised its pro­file, in­ten­si­fy­ing a no-holds-barred ap­proach to com­bat­ing per­ceived slights, which has been dubbed “wolf war­rior” diplo­macy af­ter a se­ries of jin­go­is­tic Chi­nese ac­tion films.</p>
    <p>The tac­tics, how­ever, risk a back­lash. Sur­veys sug­gest per­cep­tions of China are at an all-time low in Western democ­ra­cies but the new strat­egy is hugely pop­u­lar at home, said Ms Yun Jiang, a di­rec­tor at the China Pol­icy Cen­tre, a re­search in­sti­tute in Can­berra. “Ev­ery­one loves good old-fash­ioned na­tion­al­ism,” she added.</p>
    <p>Start­ing in 2015, Mr Zhao pi­o­neered his ag­gres­sive Twit­ter use while re­buff­ing crit­i­cism of China’s in­vest­ment in Pak­istan as min­is­ter coun­sel­lor at the em­bassy in Islamabad.</p>
    <p>As his fol­low­ing grew, he be­gan to post out­side his brief, fre­quently ac­cus­ing the US of hypocrisy and ul­te­rior mo­tives in sanc­tion­ing Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany Huawei.</p>
    <p>In July last year, Mr Zhao en­gaged in a spar­ring match with Ms Su­san Rice, former na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser to Mr Barack Obama, the former US pres­i­dent. He had de­fended China’s mass in­tern­ment cam­paign in Xin­jiang by com­par­ing ten­sions be­tween the Han ma­jor­ity and mostly Mus­lim Uighur mi­nor­ity with race re­la­tions in the US.</p>
    <p>In a now deleted tweet, Mr Zhao wrote: “If you’re in Wash­ing­ton, D.C., you know the white never go to the SW area be­cause it’s an area for the black & Latin. There’s a say­ing ‘black in & white out’.”</p>
    <p>Ms Rice re­sponded by call­ing him “a racist dis­grace”.</p>
    <p>A month later, he was pro­moted to for­eign min­istry spokesman.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao is a rel­a­tive out­sider of China’s diplo­matic es­tab­lish­ment, hav­ing at­tended Cen­tral South Univer­sity in­stead of one of the usual feeder uni­ver­si­ties for the</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry.</p>
    <p>His ca­reer has in­stead been pro­pelled by his loyal fol­low­ing on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia, where he is known as an “In­ter­net celebrity diplo­mat”.</p>
    <p>Many of his fans are young, tech savvy and openly na­tion­al­ist. Ms Hua Zhong, a stu­dent in her early 20s, said she liked Mr Zhao be­cause of his sharp tone and his “per­sis­tence in fight­ing tire­lessly shame­less Western politi­cians”.</p>
    <p>De­spite Twit­ter hav­ing been blocked in China since 2009, their diplo­mats have opened dozens of new ac­counts in the past two years. Posts from Chi­nese of­fi­cials are of­ten trans­lated and shared widely on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang said China’s For­eign Min­istry had an ad­van­tage against in­ter­locu­tors be­cause it has ready ac­cess to in­ter­na­tional so­cial me­dia plat­forms, while ac­counts of for­eign lead­ers and diplo­mats are reg­u­larly cen­sored in China.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, WeChat, one of China’s largest so­cial me­dia plat­forms, re­moved a post by Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son about Mr Zhao’s tweet di­rected at Chi­nese Australian­s.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think the West has fully ap­pre­ci­ated that China can cre­ate a bub­ble of its own (at home),” said Mr Yang, “and at the same time in­ter­act with the rest of the world in this new way (on western so­cial me­dia).”</p>
