    <p>TRANS­FORM­ING INTO MAR­GARET THATCHER:</p>
    <p>Some view­ers may won­der how Amer­i­can ac­tress Gil­lian An­der­son (right) turned into for­mer Bri­tish prime min­is­ter Mar­garet Thatcher in the lat­est sea­son of tele­vi­sion se­ries The Crown (2016 to present).</p>
    <p>An­der­son, 52, shared a se­ries of photos on In­sta­gram last Friday, which gave a glimpse of her trans­for­ma­tion into the late leader, who was well known for her bouf­fant hairdo.</p>
    <p>Mrs Thatcher was Bri­tain’s first fe­male prime min­is­ter and was in of­fice from 1979 to 1990. She died aged 87 in 2013.</p>
    <p>An­der­son was seen in the photos don­ning one of the wigs with her own blonde hair stick­ing out, as a hair­styl­ist po­si­tioned the hair­piece on her head.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, who is best known for her role as spe­cial agent Dana Scully in the science fiction-su­per­nat­u­ral tele­vi­sion se­ries The X-Files (1993 to 2018), also shared photos of the dif­fer­ent wigs used in The Crown, as she wrote:</p>
    <p>“An ode to my wig (s).”</p>
    <p>An­der­son re­vealed in me­dia in­ter­views that she did not use pros­thet­ics or teeth to play Mrs Thatcher, but she did wear a body suit to make her look a bit wider.</p>
    <p>She said she re­lied on body lan­guage and had two vo­cal coaches to help her cap­ture</p>
    <p>Mrs Thatcher’s ap­pear­ance for her role in the Net­flix se­ries about the reign of Queen El­iz­a­beth II.</p>
