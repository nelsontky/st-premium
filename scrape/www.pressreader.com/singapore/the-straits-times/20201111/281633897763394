    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Work to dis­trib­ute the ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioN­Tech is gear­ing up af­ter the com­pa­nies an­nounced suc­cess­ful in­terim data on Mon­day, but it will not be com­ing to lo­cal phar­ma­cies for the pub­lic any time soon.</p>
    <p>The data showed that the vac­cine is 90 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing Covid-19, and the firms are await­ing data on safety, which could come later this month.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and BioN­Tech need to get reg­u­la­tors to sign off on the shot be­fore they can start ship­ping vac­cines to those con­sid­ered most in need by the United States gov­ern­ment. Health­care work­ers and peo­ple liv­ing in nurs­ing homes will likely top that list.</p>
    <p>But the vac­cine’s com­plex and su­per-cold stor­age needs are an ob­sta­cle for even the most so­phis­ti­cated hos­pi­tals in the US and may im­pact when and where it is avail­able in ru­ral ar­eas or poor coun­tries where re­sources are tight.</p>
    <p>The main is­sue is that the vac­cine, which is based on a novel tech­nol­ogy that uses syn­thetic mRNA to ac­ti­vate the im­mune sys­tem against the virus, needs to be kept at mi­nus 70 deg C or be­low.</p>
    <p>“The cold chain is go­ing to be one of the most chal­leng­ing as­pects of de­liv­ery of this vac­ci­na­tion,” said se­nior scholar Amesh Adalja from Johns Hop­kins Cen­tre for Health Se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“This will be a chal­lenge in all set­tings be­cause hos­pi­tals, even in big cities, do not have stor­age fa­cil­i­ties for a vac­cine at that ul­tralow tem­per­a­ture.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, one of the most pres­ti­gious US hos­pi­tals – the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Min­nesota – said it does not cur­rently have that ca­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Gre­gory Poland, a vi­rol­o­gist and vac­cine re­searcher at the clinic, said: “We’re talk­ing about a vac­cine that needs stor­age at mi­nus 70 or 80. That’s a tremen­dous lo­gis­ti­cal is­sue not only in the US, but out­side the Western world.</p>
    <p>“We’re a ma­jor med­i­cal cen­tre and we don’t have stor­age ca­pac­ity like this. That will be true for ev­ery­body. This is a lo­gis­ti­cal ob­sta­cle.”</p>
    <p>Pfizer spokesman Kim Bencker said the firm is work­ing closely with the US gov­ern­ment and state of­fi­cials on how to ship the vac­cine from its dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres in the US, Ger­many and Bel­gium to around the world.</p>
    <p>The de­tailed plan in­cludes us­ing dry ice to trans­port frozen vac­cine vials by both air and land at their rec­om­mended tem­per­a­tures for up to 10 days, she added.</p>
    <p>State and lo­cal health­care providers are re­spon­si­ble for stor­ing and ad­min­is­ter­ing vac­cines once they have been de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>They can be kept in an ul­tra-low tem­per­a­ture freezer for up to six months, or for five days at 2 deg C to 8 deg C – re­frig­er­a­tion com­monly avail­able at hos­pi­tals, Ms Bencker said. The Pfizer stor­age units can also be re­filled with ice for up to 15 days, she added.</p>
    <p>But shots will spoil in around five days at nor­mal re­frig­er­a­tion tem­per­a­tures of slightly above freez­ing. BioN­Tech chief ex­ec­u­tive Ugur Sahin said the firms are analysing if they can ex­tend that for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the vac­cine de­vel­oped by Moderna Ther­a­peu­tics, which is based on sim­i­lar tech­nol­ogy, does not need to be stored at such a low tem­per­a­ture. Other vac­cines, in­clud­ing those from John­son & John­son and No­vavax, can be stored at 2- 8 deg C, the tem­per­a­ture of a reg­u­lar re­frig­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists, pub­lic health of­fi­cials and in­vestors have wel­comed the first suc­cess­ful in­terim data from Pfizer as a wa­ter­shed mo­ment that could help turn the tide of the pan­demic if the full trial re­sults pan out.</p>
    <p>Emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­fes­sor Peter Horby from the Univer­sity of Ox­ford said: “This news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a re­lief to see such pos­i­tive re­sults on this vac­cine and bodes well for Covid-19 vac­cines in gen­eral.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, ex­perts said they wanted to see the full trial data. There are still many ques­tions, such as how ef­fec­tive the vac­cine is by eth­nic­ity or age and how long im­mu­nity may last.</p>
    <p>“But the bot­tom line is, as a vac­cine, it’s more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, which is ex­tra­or­di­nary,” top US in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert An­thony Fauci told CNN.</p>
    <p>Pfizer ex­pects to seek US emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for peo­ple aged 16 to 85. To do so, it will need two months of fol­low-up safety data to as­sure that no side ef­fects crop up. That is ex­pected to be avail­able next week.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the cold stor­age needs could im­pede Pfizer’s abil­ity to reach ru­ral health­care sys­tems and nurs­ing homes, or less wealthy coun­tries, which may not have the funds for the re­frig­er­a­tion units.</p>
    <p>Ms Claire Han­nan, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Im­mu­ni­sa­tion Man­agers, a lobby group for lo­cal pub­lic health of­fi­cials who han­dle vac­cines, said: “If Pfizer’s is the only vac­cine to be au­tho­rised in the next few months, we do worry about equity when it comes to spread­ing it to ru­ral ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>Some states have al­ready said they have a short­age of ul­tra-cold freez­ers, ac­cord­ing to pub­lic doc­u­ments that states filed with the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>With­out the ex­tra equip­ment, doc­tors will have a dilemma: Store vac­cines in stan­dard re­frig­er­a­tors and de­ploy all 975 doses in each Pfizer vac­cine con­tainer in less than five days, or re­stock them with dry ice and open them only twice a day to ex­tend the vac­cines’ life span, said Ms Han­nan.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion warned that there is a fund­ing gap of US$4.5 bil­lion (S$6.1 bil­lion) that could slow ac­cess to tests, medicines and vac­cines in low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries.</p>
    <p>DIS­TRI­BU­TION CHAL­LENGE</p>
    <p>The cold chain is go­ing to be one of the most chal­leng­ing as­pects of de­liv­ery of this vac­ci­na­tion. This will be a chal­lenge in all set­tings be­cause hos­pi­tals, even in big cities, do not have stor­age fa­cil­i­ties for a vac­cine at that ul­tra-low tem­per­a­ture.</p>
