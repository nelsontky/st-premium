    <p>Fans of med­i­cal drama ER (1995 to 2004) might re­mem­ber Ming-Na Wen as Dr Deb Chen – one of the few Asian faces on a ma­jor Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion show at the time.</p>
    <p>Wen’s ca­reer has qui­etly ad­vanced Asian representa­tion in Hol­ly­wood over the years, from her turn in The Joy Luck Club (1993), a drama about Chi­nese-Amer­i­can women, to Dis­ney’s iconic Mu­lan an­i­mated films (1998 to 2004), in which she voiced the ti­tle char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>Since 2013, the Ma­cau-born star has also shared top billing on Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D., Mar­vel’s first tele­vi­sion show.</p>
    <p>The 56-year-old plays Agent Melinda May, a pi­lot, weapons ex­pert and all-round fighter in a law-en­force­ment agency that deals with the su­per­hu­man and para­nor­mal.</p>
    <p>The sev­enth and fi­nal sea­son of Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. airs at 9pm on Thurs­days on Fox (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 330, StarHub TV Chan­nel 505) and streams on Fox+.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting to The Straits Times over the tele­phone from Los An­ge­les, Wen – who also ap­pears in the Dis­ney+ Star Wars spin-off The Man­dalo­rian (2019 to present) – re­mem­bers when Hol­ly­wood roles for Asians were few and far be­tween.</p>
    <p>“Back when I did The Joy Luck Club, we had only three TV chan­nels. So I fought and went af­ter roles that weren’t specif­i­cally Asian to be­gin with; Deb Chen wasn’t.</p>
    <p>“At the au­di­tion, it was me and a dozen Cau­casian women. Then once they cast me, they changed the name. And the same thing with May.”</p>
    <p>Al­though The Joy Luck Club won her crit­i­cal ac­claim, Wen’s work in the Mar­vel and Dis­ney uni­verses holds a spe­cial place in her heart.</p>
    <p>“I’m such a geek and a nerd. My child­hood was this world of comic books, Star Wars, and sci­ence fic­tion and fan­tasy.</p>
    <p>“Now be­ing on the other side and play­ing a char­ac­ter that in­spires or con­nects with the fans – that’s been the big­gest joy be­cause I know how they feel.</p>
    <p>“When I see them get­ting ex­cited or telling me what a sto­ry­line did for them, it’s like com­ing full cir­cle.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tion-heavy Mar­vel show, in which Wen did many of her own stunts, is also “the one role that helped me stay in shape for seven years”, she says.</p>
    <p>And her eth­nic­ity be­ing writ­ten into the show sent a pow­er­ful mes­sage about in­clu­sion “by mak­ing it not an is­sue and mak­ing it a thing that should be part of the norm”.</p>
    <p>“That, for me, is the big­gest way to in­flu­ence any­one. They’re see­ing the char­ac­ter, they’re fall­ing in love with the char­ac­ter and he or she just hap­pens to be Asian.</p>
    <p>“That is the ul­ti­mate way to get peo­ple to ac­cept that we’re all equal and not dif­fer­ent. If we have dif­fer­ences in how we look, it only en­hances the hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence,” says Wen, who is mar­ried to ac­tor Eric Michael Zee, 54, and has a daugh­ter, 19, and a son, 14.</p>
    <p>But de­spite on-screen di­ver­sity im­prov­ing, the veteran per­former feels that in Hol­ly­wood, Asian tal­ent still face an up­hill bat­tle and have to keep prov­ing them­selves over and over.</p>
    <p>Progress here “goes for­wards and back­wards”, she ob­serves. “Some­times, it’s all about what’s hot and trend­ing, and what’s go­ing to make them money at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“So I don’t take it per­son­ally. It’s show busi­ness and there is a need for them to make money.”</p>
    <p>Thus, the ro­man­tic com­edy Crazy Rich Asians (2018) “was fan­tas­tic be­cause it per­pet­u­ated that glam­orous, sexy, beau­ti­ful im­age of Asians and it made boat­loads of money”.</p>
    <p>Still, “it was kind of sad that it took 25 years af­ter The Joy Luck Club to fi­nally have an­other big, im­pact­ful all-Asian cast movie”, Wen says. “That’s too long. We now need to come up with an­other one in a cou­ple of years, not 25 years.”</p>
    <p>How did she her­self man­age to beat the odds and land all those plum roles?</p>
    <p>“Well, my mum would say that it’s be­cause of the shape of my nose. Be­cause my bridge is high for an Asian woman,” she says, chuck­ling.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s part luck, part hard work, hav­ing a good team be­hind me and my train­ing at (the School of Drama) at Carnegie Mel­lon (Univer­sity)... And just be­liev­ing in my­self,” she con­cludes. “I never set­tled.”</p>
