    <p>For­mer drug ad­dicts will get a big­ger help­ing hand from the Gov­ern­ment and community or­gan­i­sa­tions to find jobs and rein­te­grate into so­ci­ety amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and National De­vel­op­ment Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to pre­vent drug abuse and spread aware­ness of the harm­ful ef­fects of drugs in the community, par­tic­u­larly among youth, will also be stepped up, he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a visit to Jamiyah Half­way House last Thurs­day, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Faishal said re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and em­ploy­ment of for­mer ad­dicts are key planks in pre­vent­ing ad­dicts from re­laps­ing.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic has af­fected many lives, and this in­cludes our ex-of­fend­ers who have gone through the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion process. One of the key things they look out for is jobs, and de­spite the chal­lenges, we want to pro­vide job op­por­tu­ni­ties for our ex-in­mates,” said Prof Faishal.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise that it may not be easy. We are work­ing with our op­er­a­tors and part­ners to see how they are able to pro­vide sup­port dur­ing this pe­riod, and at the same time, see how (ex-of­fend­ers) can be con­nected with community or­gan­i­sa­tions where, de­spite not be­ing able to get a job, they are still able to get so­cial sup­port,” he added.</p>
    <p>On its part, Jamiyah Half­way House is turn­ing to new and creative meth­ods of help­ing for­mer ad­dicts stay on the right track. One such ini­tia­tive is mu­ral paint­ing, an ex­ten­sion of the cen­tre’s art ther­apy pro­gramme. Seven res­i­dents from the half­way house started paint­ing the first mu­ral last month.</p>
    <p>Jamiyah Half­way House head Faizal Abas said the aim of the creative re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion is to as­sist res­i­dents in us­ing art as a cop­ing mech­a­nism to fight and even­tu­ally over­come their drug ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>He added that the half­way house also has plans to launch a mu­sic ther­apy pro­gramme by early next year. About 60 of the 75 res­i­dents at the cen­tre par­tic­i­pate in the weekly art ther­apy pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>One res­i­dent, who de­clined to be named, said join­ing the pro­gramme has boosted his con­fi­dence and given him a chance to get to know his peers.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old, who started serv­ing a sen­tence for drug-re­lated of­fences in March last year, joined the half­way house two months ago.</p>
    <p>He said: “Dur­ing the process of com­plet­ing the mu­ral, there was team­work and com­mu­ni­ca­tion. We learnt how to share ideas and... how to be pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese qual­i­ties are hard to cul­ti­vate for us and we can ap­ply this to the community out­side as well.</p>
    <p>“It is not just about the paint­ing and the art. It helps us with our sense of self-aware­ness.”</p>
