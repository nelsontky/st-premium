    <p>Mr David Chap­ple be­gan plan­ning his trip to the 2020 Ed­in­burgh Fes­ti­val Fringe a year ago, since one can­not be too pre­pared when one holds the world record for the most Fringe per­for­mances at­tended in a sea­son.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing seen a record-break­ing 304 shows in 27 days in 2014, he was plan­ning an­other Fringe view­ing marathon this year for his wife’s 60th birth­day.</p>
    <p>But in early April, the event – the world’s largest arts fes­ti­val – was can­celled for the first time in its 73-year his­tory be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For Mr Chap­ple, a civil servant who es­ti­mates that he spends half his i ncome on watch­ing live com­edy and keeps chick­ens named af­ter Bri­tish stand-up co­me­di­ans, it was dev­as­tat­ing. “Ed­in­burgh is ev­ery­thing, re­ally,” he said. “It’s the fo­cal point of our year.”</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val’s can­cel­la­tion has been a big blow to long-term fans – and to the 30,000 per­form­ers who travel to the Scot­tish city each Au­gust to show their work.</p>
    <p>To fill the gap, some artists have gone on­line to try to cap­ture the an­ar­chic, di­verse and some­what over­whelm­ing ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing at the Fringe.</p>
    <p>Among them is Ms Francesca Moody, a Lon­don-based the­atre pro­ducer who took the orig­i­nal stage ver­sion of black com­edy Fleabag to the Fringe in 2013 and had planned to stage three plays in Ed­in­burgh this month.</p>
    <p>When the fes­ti­val was called off, her fel­low theatremak­er Gary Mc­Nair joked that he would have to stage a “Shed Fringe” from his gar­den in­stead – a pun that “set cogs whirring” i n Ms Moody’s pro­ducer brain.</p>
    <p>Six weeks ago, she came up with “Shed­in­burgh”, an on­line fes­ti­val of com­edy and drama that streams live from a gar­den shed for three weeks start­ing last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In fact, there are two sheds, each mea­sur­ing 1.8m by 2.4m: one on­stage at Lon­don’s Soho The­atre, the other at the Tra­verse The­atre in Ed­in­burgh. Both venues have been closed since March, when the Bri­tish govern­ment or­dered the­atres to shut to help slow the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Set­ting up the sheds in­side is a nod to the quest­ing spirit of the Fringe, which takes over ev­ery cor­ner of the city of Ed­in­burgh each Au­gust, trans­form­ing pubs, gar­dens, gyms, park­ing lots and lec­ture the­atres into per­for­mance spa­ces.</p>
    <p>“The can­cel­la­tion of the Fringe has left a mas­sive hole,” said Ms Moody, who has at­tended the fes­ti­val for 17 years. “This is an op­por­tu­nity to ac­knowl­edge how mag­i­cal the fes­ti­val is, how im­por­tant it is to me and to a lot of the artists who have had suc­cess there.”</p>
    <p>Thanks to so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and space re­stric­tions, the “Shed­ule” is dom­i­nated by one-per­son shows from artists such as Jack Rooke, Deb­o­rah Frances-White and Tim Crouch. Au­di­ences will watch on video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom af­ter do­nat­ing at least £4 (S$7.20) a ticket, and prof­its will go to­wards a fund for artists aim­ing to stage a show at the Fringe next year.</p>
    <p>Be­fore plan­ning was halted be­cause of the pan­demic, this year’s Ed­in­burgh Fringe Fes­ti­val had con­firmed more than 2,200 shows from 48 coun­tries in about 230 venues, said Ms Rebecca Monks, a spokesman for the Ed­in­burgh Fes­ti­val Fringe So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>They were pre­par­ing for a fes­ti­val sim­i­lar in scale to last year’s, in which more than 3,800 shows were staged and more than three mil­lion tick­ets were sold.</p>
    <p>Ed­in­burgh is “the way that arts or­gan­i­sa­tions, venues, tele­vi­sion pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies find new work; the fact that it doesn’t ex­ist this year will have a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact”, said Ms Moody, who knows how life-chang­ing a suc­cess­ful Fringe can be.</p>
    <p>When she and Fleabag cre­ator Phoebe Waller-Bridge took Fleabag to a dank vault un­der Ed­in­burgh’s Ge­orge IV Bridge seven years ago, they raised money on crowd-fund­ing plat­form Kick­starter, did not pay them­selves and gave away tick­ets for the first week to fill the 60-seater room.</p>
    <p>It be­came one of that year’s mosttalked-about shows, which led to a run at Lon­don’s Soho The­atre, where it caught the at­ten­tion of the BBC’s head of com­edy.</p>
    <p>This year, such op­por­tu­ni­ties have es­sen­tially van­ished.</p>
    <p>“For all those artists who were tak­ing their first shot at the Fringe this year,” Ms Moody said, “that work might never resur­face be­cause they might not have the strong foun­da­tions or the sup­port to carry on.”</p>
    <p>“Shed­in­burgh” is j ust one way the­atremak­ers are keep­ing the Fringe flame burn­ing.</p>
    <p>Fringe on Fri­day is a weekly hour­long cabaret stream­ing from per­form­ers’ homes; Ed­in­burgh Un­locked is a com­edy fes­ti­val in au­dio­book form from Pen­guin Ran­dom House fea­tur­ing 15-minute sets from stand-ups whose shows were can­celled; Zoo TV is of­fer­ing on­de­mand stream­ing of past Ed­in­burgh per­for­mances; and Fringe of Colour is screen­ing daily films by artists of colour.</p>
    <p>Ms Cor­rie McGuire, a com­edy pro­ducer who has staged the rau­cously in­ter­ac­tive mid­night show Spank! at the Ed­in­burgh Fringe for the past 15 years, es­ti­mates that her agency lost £60,000 “overnight” when the the­atres closed in March. One-quar­ter of that would have come from Ed­in­burgh.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, she staged the first on­line Spank! with stand-up co­me­di­ans Lau­ren Pat­ti­son and Em­manuel Sonubi per­form­ing from their bed­rooms; Mag­i­cal Bones, a break-danc­ing ma­gi­cian, do­ing tricks in his kitchen; and Vikki Stone singing songs from her at­tic.</p>
    <p>To com­bat the “Zoom fa­tigue” that many peo­ple are feel­ing amid the plethora of on­line events and meet­ings dur­ing the pan­demic, Ms McGuire said, she cre­ated a vir­tual front row in which 10 au­di­ence mem­bers could vol­un­teer to “sit up front” and have their mi­cro­phones taken off mute so that per­form­ers could hear their re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing able to have peo­ple from all over the world watch­ing the same gig gave it real Ed­in­burgh en­ergy,” she added.</p>
