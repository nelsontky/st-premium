    <p>Keep­ing Sin­ga­pore clean will be the pri­or­ity of the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment in the months ahead. Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said Sin­ga­pore’s bat­tle against Covid-19 and dengue has high­lighted the im­por­tance of pub­lic hy­giene, vec­tor con­trol, clean san­i­ta­tion, qual­ity wa­ter and safe food.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing Sin­ga­pore clean will be the pri­or­ity of the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) in the months ahead, with new leg­is­la­tion to be in­tro­duced in the next three to six months.</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Fu, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, said yes­ter­day that Sin­ga­pore’s bat­tle against Covid-19 and dengue had high­lighted the im­por­tance of pub­lic hy­giene, vec­tor con­trol, san­i­ta­tion, qual­ity wa­ter and safe food.</p>
    <p>“These are all im­por­tant ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties in life that we shouldn’t take for granted. And I would like to work on that,” she told the me­dia in her first vir­tual press con­fer­ence as Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu had taken over the port­fo­lio from Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, who is now Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, dur­ing the Cabi­net reshuf­fle last month.</p>
    <p>She said the changes to the ex­ist­ing En­vi­ron­men­tal Pub­lic Health Act will look at im­prov­ing stan­dards of pub­lic hy­giene, es­pe­cially in ar­eas with vul­ner­a­ble users, such as child­care and el­der­care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“I think we have re­alised that it’s not j ust about the fre­quency of clean­ing, or the number of clean­ers we have, but it’s re­ally about how we clean bet­ter as well,” said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic clean­li­ness in Sin­ga­pore has re­mained lack­lus­tre de­spite nu­mer­ous ini­tia­tives en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to clean up af­ter them­selves in pub­lic ar­eas such as hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Asked how the re­newed national clean­li­ness cam­paign, SG Clean, could change things, Ms Fu said that Covid-19 has el­e­vated ex­pec­ta­tions of what be­ing clean and hy­gienic means. For in­stance, more peo­ple are wash­ing their hands with soap and wa­ter more of­ten.</p>
    <p>One way to raise pub­lic hy­giene stan­dards is to en­sure that hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops pro­vide soap and toi­let paper for users.</p>
    <p>“Some­times op­er­a­tors, if they’re too busy, may over­look sim­ple things like that. So we need to... re-em­pha­sise their im­por­tance,” she said. “And we’re look­ing at how leg­is­la­tion change can make more ef­fec­tive re­quire­ments on the fa­cil­ity or the venue owner.”</p>
    <p>But cus­tomers also have a part to play, she added.</p>
    <p>Din­ers some­times claim that re­turn­ing their trays af­ter meals would take away jobs from clean­ers, who are of­ten el­derly. But with se­niors be­ing more vul­ner­a­ble to in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing Covid-19, din­ers could help pro­tect the clean­ers by re­turn­ing their own used crock­ery to cen­tralised clean­ing sta­tions.</p>
    <p>“We should look af­ter their in­ter­est and their health, be­cause for them to come across soiled tis­sues and used masks at the hawker cen­tre... it’s re­ally not fair to them. That’s not a job hazard that they have bar­gained for,” said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hour-long in­ter­view, Ms Fu also fielded ques­tions on other sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>She high­lighted how the re­nam­ing of her min­istry, for­merly the Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources, re­flected the grow­ing im­por­tance of sus­tain­abil­ity here.</p>
    <p>“We are co­or­di­nat­ing among the min­istries to look at how we can put sus­tain­abil­ity re­ally at the heart of many of our poli­cies, from in­vest­ments to en­ergy, trans­porta­tion and build­ings,” she said.</p>
    <p>There would be job op­por­tu­ni­ties in these ar­eas, said Ms Fu, cit­ing the growth of sec­tors such as food pro­duc­tion, the cir­cu­lar econ­omy and re­search into cli­mate science.</p>
    <p>She also touched on the grow­ing youth cli­mate move­ment, and how her ex­pe­ri­ence at the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, which she pre­vi­ously helmed, could in­form outreach ef­forts.</p>
    <p>She noted that there were on­go­ing di­a­logues in her cur­rent min­istry, such as on Sin­ga­pore’s zero-waste am­bi­tions. She said her ex­pe­ri­ence with the National Youth Coun­cil and Youth Ac­tion Chal­lenge could come in handy in terms of bring­ing peo­ple with dif­fer­ent ideas to the ta­ble to dis­cuss is­sues and un­der­stand why cer­tain de­ci­sions are made – even if they do not al­ways agree.</p>
    <p>“This un­der­stand­ing of pol­icy ra­tio­nale... is im­por­tant be­cause, like many of the de­ci­sions that we make, it’s about trade-offs,” she said, adding that these in­clude so­cial or eco­nomic trade-offs, or in­ter-gen­er­a­tional eq­uity.</p>
    <p>“These are all trade-offs, and there is no right or wrong, but a spec­trum. And where we land some­times may not be ideal or per­fect for some groups, but at least I think they will un­der­stand as it’s be­cause we have made those trade-offs.”</p>
