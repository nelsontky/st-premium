    <p>MALAYSIA’S EX-PM UN­VEILS NAME OF NEW PO­LIT­I­CAL PARTY</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s two-time prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad yes­ter­day un­veiled the name of his new po­lit­i­cal party, four years af­ter launch­ing a party from which he was re­cently sacked. The new party is called Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air, or Fight­ers of the Na­tion Party.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to split the Malays, but we want Malays to have a party that fights for them. This party is to cleanse the coun­try of cor­rup­tion. We name this party Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air,” Tun Dr Ma­hathir told a rally in Perak state.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at the event to in­tro­duce can­di­date Amir Khusyairi Mo­hamad Tanusi, 38, an Is­lamic lawyer, who will con­test the Slim state by-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>As Pe­juang is not reg­is­tered yet,</p>
    <p>Mr Amir will stand as an in­de­pen­dent against a can­di­date from Umno which is de­fend­ing its strong­hold seat.</p>
    <p>Polling will be on Aug 29.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, in re­veal­ing the name of the new party on his pop­u­lar Chedet blog, Dr Ma­hathir wrote: “Cor­rup­tion de­stroys our race and cor­rup­tion de­stroys the Malays. If you want po­si­tions and money, choose an­other party.”</p>
    <p>He said his for­mer Parti Pribumi</p>
    <p>Ber­satu Malaysia party had been hi­jacked to save klep­to­crats.</p>
    <p>“If you want to re­deem your dig­nity and de­fend our rights, choose our party, choose Pe­juang,” said Dr Ma­hathir, who turned 95 last month.</p>
    <p>Pe­juang will im­me­di­ately have six MPs, one state assem­bly­man and one sen­a­tor – all for­mer law­mak­ers from Ber­satu in­clud­ing Dr Ma­hathir.</p>
    <p>The for­mer prime min­is­ter who launched Ber­satu i n 2016 was sacked af­ter he dis­agreed with its pres­i­dent, now Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, over form­ing a new al­liance with Umno to rule Malaysia.</p>
    <p>In a dis­play of op­po­si­tion unity, Dr Ma­hathir was flanked on stage by lead­ers from the three par­ties in the Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Since Dr Ma­hathir an­nounced his new party last Fri­day, Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s coali­tion has been roiled by sev­eral di­vi­sional lead­ers who jumped ship to sup­port the nona­ge­nar­ian.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, amid spec­u­la­tion of an im­mi­nent gen­eral elec­tion, de facto Law Min­is­ter Takiyud­din Has­san said it would cost the govern­ment about RM1.2 bil­lion (S$393 mil­lion) this time round, be­cause of mea­sures linked to the Covid-19 pan­demic. The last gen­eral elec­tion in May 2018 cost RM500 mil­lion.</p>
