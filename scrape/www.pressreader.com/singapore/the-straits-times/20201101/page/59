After a run, consider having a cup of watermelon or watermelon juice. Berries Red, purple and blue foods like berries are also rich in antioxidan­ts and low in sugar, which makes them an ideal fruit source for runners who are watching their body weight. Kiwi Kiwis contain 2½ times your daily Vitamin C requiremen­t and antioxidan­ts for a strong immune system and muscle healing. It is also a source of serotonin for relaxation and improving sleep quality, so enjoying both green and gold kiwi at breakfast or as a light pre-sleep snack can help to boost recovery overnight. Beetroot is rich in antioxidan­ts and nitrates, which have been shown to decrease muscle soreness and increase blood flow to damaged muscles for healing respective­ly. Salmon When we run on hard concrete surfaces or in high intensity and volume, it creates micro-damage in the leg muscles that requires a diet of regular high-quality protein and essential fatty acids to heal. This includes oily fish like salmon that are high in muscle-rebuilding protein and rich in Omega 3 anti-inflammato­ry oils. SUNDAY TIMES GRAPHICS Tart cherry juice Tart cherry juice has been proven to reduce inflammati­on and pain after strenuous exercise, as well as support sound sleep. As muscle healing mostly occurs during sleep, you can take this sour juice after a run and before bed, especially if your running is leaving you fatigued.
