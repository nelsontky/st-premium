    <p>If Asia’s prob­lem with Don­ald Trump’s pres­i­dency was his bru­tally trans­ac­tional ap­proach to trade and se­cu­rity, could hu­man rights pro­mo­tion be­come the new source of fric­tion with US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s Demo­cratic ad­min­is­tra­tion?</p>
    <p>Al­though many in Asia worry about the sweep­ing rhetoric of the Democrats on democ­racy pro­mo­tion, re­al­ists be­lieve Wash­ing­ton will be un­der pres­sure to bal­ance Amer­ica’s hu­man rights con­cerns against its geopo­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent Asian na­tions have faced the Amer­i­can ire on hu­man rights is­sues be­fore; but many of them have learnt to en­dure the con­se­quences or found ways to keep the US pres­sure in check.</p>
    <p>The sense of na­tional sovereignt­y is quite strong in Asian na­tions – democ­ra­cies or oth­er­wise – and re­sis­tance against out­side in­ter­fer­ence is eas­ily mo­bilised. Stand­ing up to the US also gen­er­ates sup­port from Amer­ica’s ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Asian chan­cel­leries – big and small – have also fig­ured out that Wash­ing­ton is not a mono­lith; there are mul­ti­ple groups try­ing to in­flu­ence US pol­icy, and hu­man rights groups are one among the many. There are groups and in­sti­tu­tions with other in­ter­ests that are open to more prac­ti­cal en­gage­ment; many of them sup­port mod­er­a­tion and sus­tained en­gage­ment with Asia.</p>
    <p>The his­tory of US for­eign pol­icy tells us that no ma­jor Amer­i­can bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship has ever been held a hostage to a sin­gle is­sue like hu­man rights. That broad trend is likely to hold un­der the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion too.</p>
    <p>Con­sider for a mo­ment the cur­rent de­bate among the Bi­den peo­ple on China and In­dia – Asia’s largest po­lit­i­cal en­ti­ties with very dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The past few months have seen mount­ing con­gres­sional and other pres­sures on Wash­ing­ton to act on con­cerns about democ­racy and rights in China – from Hong Kong to Xin­jiang and Ti­bet. The US Congress ap­proved a se­ries of mea­sures against Bei­jing, while out­go­ing Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo and other se­nior Cab­i­net mem­bers have ar­tic­u­lated a fun­da­men­tal ide­o­log­i­cal con­flict be­tween the US and China. Yet, for Mr Trump, a favourable trade deal with China was a far higher pri­or­ity than chal­leng­ing the le­git­i­macy of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>A CLASH OF HAWKS</p>
    <p>How might Mr Bi­den deal with China? Al­though he la­belled Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping a “thug” dur­ing the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign, he might have no choice but to main­tain a working re­la­tion­ship with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>While pro­gres­sives in the Demo­cratic Party want him to make democ­racy pro­mo­tion a ma­jor ob­jec­tive with China and de­fence hawks ar­gue for a tougher re­sponse to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary chal­lenge, they are up against pow­er­ful forces that have backed the Pres­i­dent-elect’s cam­paign, in­clud­ing Wall Street and Sil­i­con Val­ley, which want a re­turn to pro­duc­tive com­mer­cial co­op­er­a­tion with China. The “cli­mate hawks” in the party want a sin­gu­lar fo­cus on co­op­er­a­tion with China to ad­dress what they con­sider the sin­gle most im­por­tant threat to hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>China has moved quickly to lever­age the con­tra­dic­tions, by of­fer­ing progress on car­bon emis­sions and open­ing up the fi­nan­cial sec­tor to Wall Street.</p>
    <p>China has in­vested more than any coun­try in un­der­stand­ing the do­mes­tic dy­nam­ics of the United States and de­vel­oped ca­pa­bil­i­ties to nav­i­gate be­tween the con­tend­ing forces shap­ing US poli­cies and en­sur­ing that po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tions in Wash­ing­ton do not harm Bei­jing’s mas­sive stakes in the US.</p>
    <p>If be­ing a com­mu­nist was a drag for China in Wash­ing­ton, In­dia’s iden­tity as the world’s largest democ­racy al­ways brought much good­will for Delhi.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sec­tions of the lib­eral es­tab­lish­ment in the US now worry that In­dia is be­com­ing an il­lib­eral democ­racy and there is some con­cern among the Demo­cratic Party about In­dia’s re­cent change</p>
    <p>in the con­sti­tu­tional sta­tus of Kash­mir, the Cit­i­zen­ship Amend­ment Act, and the grow­ing in­se­cu­rity of mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>The Modi gov­ern­ment has sought to ad­dress these con­cerns while also ex­pand­ing the am­bit of In­dia’s co­op­er­a­tion with the US, es­pe­cially in the de­fence do­main. Delhi is con­fi­dent that its shared in­ter­ests with Wash­ing­ton on Indo-Pa­cific se­cu­rity, cli­mate change and trade would limit the po­ten­tial harm from crit­i­cism on the rights front.</p>
    <p>CHECKS ON HU­MAN RIGHTS POLI­CIES</p>
    <p>That brings us to the struc­tural fac­tors that set bound­aries to Amer­ica’s hu­man rights poli­cies. Five of them stand out.</p>
    <p>One, pro­mo­tion of hu­man rights is very much part of US for­eign pol­icy ide­ol­ogy, but Wash­ing­ton has no op­tion but to tem­per it in the pur­suit of mul­ti­ple other US in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>What each ad­min­is­tra­tion does with it varies ac­cord­ing to spe­cific cir­cum­stances and the state of re­la­tion­ship with the coun­try or re­gion in ques­tion.</p>
    <p>While the Amer­i­can rhetoric on rights tends to be uni­ver­sal­is­tic, it has al­ways ended up be­ing tai­lored to dif­fer­ent coun­tries and dif­fer­ent cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Se­lec­tive ap­pli­ca­tion of hu­man rights does not make the US uniquely hyp­o­crit­i­cal. All ma­jor pow­ers – whether democ­ra­cies or com­mu­nist – strug­gle to rec­on­cile pro­claimed ide­ol­ogy and spe­cific na­tional in­ter­ests. No coun­try can ever be­come a cause. Even rev­o­lu­tion­ary states such as the Soviet Union, the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China and Is­lamic Re­pub­lic of Iran have had to bal­ance rad­i­cal ide­ol­ogy and na­tional in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Two, the rel­a­tive de­cline of US power and the emer­gence of a peer com­peti­tor like China have shrunk the mar­gin for Amer­ica’s hu­man rights di­plo­macy.</p>
    <p>In the im­me­di­ate af­ter­math of the Cold War, the US had the lux­ury of tar­get­ing dif­fer­ent coun­tries on hu­man rights with­out a ref­er­ence to eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal costs. Now, the US will have to be a lit­tle more care­ful to avoid alien­at­ing its part­ners – cur­rent and po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Three, there is a pro­found cri­sis in the ide­ol­ogy of Western hu­man­i­tar­i­an­ism that gained so much trac­tion af­ter the Cold War. The in­ter­ven­tions by Western states and non-state ac­tors in other so­ci­eties have more of­ten than not pro­duced dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ven­tions to pro­mote democ­racy, for ex­am­ple in Afghanista­n, Iraq and Libya, have been far too costly and yet un­suc­cess­ful. There is de­clin­ing po­lit­i­cal sup­port in the Amer­i­can heart­land for Wash­ing­ton’s for­eign ad­ven­tures in the name of democ­racy pro­mo­tion. Some in the US are be­gin­ning to see that democ­racy and hu­man rights are not an out­sider’s gifts to a so­ci­ety; they must evolve or­gan­i­cally within.</p>
    <p>Four, dif­fer­ences have emerged within the West and among the hu­man rights groups. Con­sider, for ex­am­ple, the re­cent di­ver­gence be­tween the US and France on the re­la­tion­ship be­tween re­li­gion and state, on how to deal with Is­lamic rad­i­cal­ism in a demo­cratic so­ci­ety and, more broadly, about the na­ture of iden­tity pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>There are also deep­en­ing dif­fer­ences be­tween groups that sup­port women’s re­pro­duc­tive rights around the world and those want­ing to ban abor­tions in the name of the right to life. Those de­mand­ing civil and po­lit­i­cal rights don’t al­ways agree with those that de­fine reli­gious free­dom in spe­cific ways.</p>
    <p>Five, the cri­sis in US democ­racy can no longer be kept un­der wraps. Amer­ica’s cred­i­bil­ity in preach­ing democ­racy has been dented se­verely in re­cent elec­tions that have high­lighted prob­lems of po­lit­i­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tion, the le­git­i­macy of in­sti­tu­tions like the Se­nate and the Elec­toral Col­lege, and elec­toral pro­ce­dures. While Mr Trump’s be­hav­iour, in­clud­ing an at­tempted in­sur­rec­tion this week, has made it worse, there is no es­cap­ing the struc­tural prob­lems con­fronting the world’s most pow­er­ful democ­racy.</p>
    <p>PUTTING OWN HOUSE IN OR­DER</p>
    <p>Most sin­gle-is­sue groups in the US are un­likely to give up on their cru­sades for rights in other so­ci­eties. But Mr Bi­den and his team have recog­nised the ten­sion be­tween the in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal, and the im­por­tance of putting Amer­ica’s house in or­der. In his vic­tory speech af­ter the re­sults of the elec­tion in early Novem­ber, Mr Bi­den in­sisted that Amer­ica at its best “is a bea­con for the globe”; but he added that the US must “lead not by the ex­am­ple of our power, but by the power of our ex­am­ple”.</p>
    <p>In iden­ti­fy­ing the chal­lenges ahead for his ten­ure, Mr Bi­den fo­cused on the do­mes­tic rather than the for­eign and pointed to the bat­tles to “con­trol the virus”,</p>
    <p>“build pros­per­ity”, “se­cure your fam­ily’s health­care” and “root out sys­temic racism in this coun­try”.</p>
    <p>But hu­man rights are un­likely to dis­ap­pear from the US agenda. Re­act­ing to the sweep­ing ar­rests in Hong Kong this week, Mr Bi­den’s nom­i­nee for Sec­re­tary of State Antony Blinken called them an “as­sault on those bravely ad­vo­cat­ing for univer­sal rights”.</p>
    <p>Mr Blinken also promised that “the Bi­den-Har­ris ad­min­is­tra­tion will stand with the peo­ple of Hong Kong and against Bei­jing’s crack­down on democ­racy”. Trans­lat­ing this sen­ti­ment into con­se­quen­tial ac­tion, how­ever, will not be easy for Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>In the end, se­lec­tiv­ity and com­pro­mise are most likely to mark US hu­man rights di­plo­macy in Asia.</p>
