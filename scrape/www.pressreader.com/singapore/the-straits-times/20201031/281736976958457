    <p>PARIS • Fu­ture pan­demics will hap­pen more of­ten, kill more peo­ple and wreak even worse dam­age to the global econ­omy than Covid-19 with­out a fun­da­men­tal shift in how hu­mans treat na­ture, the United Na­tions’ bio­di­ver­sity panel has said.</p>
    <p>Warn­ing that there are up to 850,000 viruses which, like the coro­n­avirus, ex­ist in an­i­mals and may be able to in­fect peo­ple, the panel – known as IPBES – said pan­demics rep­re­sented an “ex­is­ten­tial threat” to hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>Au­thors of the spe­cial re­port on bio­di­ver­sity and pan­demics said on Thurs­day that habi­tat destruc­tion and in­sa­tiable con­sump­tion made an­i­mal-borne diseases far more likely to make the jump to peo­ple in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“There is no great mys­tery about the cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic – or any mod­ern pan­demic,” said Dr Peter Daszak, pres­i­dent of the EcoHealth Al­liance and chair­man of the IPBES work­shop that drafted the re­port.</p>
    <p>“The same hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties that drive cli­mate change and bio­di­ver­sity loss also drive pan­demic risk through their im­pacts on our en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>The panel said Covid-19 was the sixth pan­demic since the in­fluenza out­break of 1918 – all of which had been “en­tirely driven by hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude un­sus­tain­able ex­ploita­tion of the en­vi­ron­ment through de­for­esta­tion, agri­cul­tural ex­pan­sion, wildlife trade and con­sump­tion – all of which put hu­mans in in­creas­ingly close con­tact with wild and farmed an­i­mals and the diseases they har­bour.</p>
    <p>As much as 70 per cent of emerg­ing diseases, such as Ebola, Zika and HIV/Aids, are zoonotic in ori­gin, mean­ing they cir­cu­lated in an­i­mals be­fore jump­ing to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Around five new diseases break out among hu­mans ev­ery sin­gle year, any one of which has the po­ten­tial to be­come a pan­demic, the panel warned.</p>
    <p>It said in its pe­ri­odic as­sess­ment on the state of na­ture last year that more than three-quar­ters of land on Earth had al­ready been se­verely de­graded by hu­man ac­tiv­ity. Onethird of land sur­face and three­quar­ters of fresh wa­ter on the planet are cur­rently taken up by farm­ing, and hu­man­ity’s re­source use has rock­eted to 80 per cent in just three decades, it said.</p>
    <p>The panel con­ducted a vir­tual work­shop with 22 lead­ing ex­perts to come up with a list of op­tions that gov­ern­ments could take to lower the risk of re­peat pan­demics.</p>
    <p>It ac­knowl­edged the dif­fi­culty in count­ing the full eco­nomic cost of Covid-19. But the as­sess­ment pointed to es­ti­mated costs as high as US$16 tril­lion (S$22 tril­lion) as at July.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts said the cost of pre­vent­ing fu­ture pan­demics was likely to be 100 times cheaper than re­spond­ing to them, “pro­vid­ing strong eco­nomic in­cen­tives for trans­for­ma­tive change”.</p>
    <p>Dr Daszak said: “Our ap­proach has ef­fec­tively stag­nated. We still rely on at­tempts to con­tain and con­trol diseases af­ter they emerge, through vac­cines and ther­a­peu­tics.”</p>
    <p>The panel sug­gested a global, co­or­di­nated pan­demic re­sponse, and for coun­tries to agree upon tar­gets to pre­vent bio­di­ver­sity loss within an in­ter­na­tional ac­cord sim­i­lar to the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Among the op­tions for pol­i­cy­mak­ers to re­duce the like­li­hood of a Covid-19 re­run are taxes or levies on meat con­sump­tion, live­stock pro­duc­tion and other forms of “high pan­demic-risk ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>The as­sess­ment also sug­gested bet­ter reg­u­la­tion of in­ter­na­tional wildlife trade and em­pow­er­ing indige­nous com­mu­ni­ties to bet­ter pre­serve wild habi­tats.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Nick Os­tle, a re­searcher at the CEH Lan­caster En­vi­ron­ment Cen­tre at Lan­caster Univer­sity, said the panel’s as­sess­ment should serve as a “with­er­ing re­minder” of how re­liant hu­man­ity is on na­ture.</p>
    <p>“Our health, wealth and well-be­ing re­lies on the health, wealth and well-be­ing of our en­vi­ron­ment,” said Prof Os­tle, who was not in­volved in the re­search process.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenges of this pan­demic have high­lighted the im­por­tance of pro­tect­ing and restor­ing our glob­ally im­por­tant and shared en­vi­ron­men­tal ‘life-sup­port’ sys­tems.”</p>
