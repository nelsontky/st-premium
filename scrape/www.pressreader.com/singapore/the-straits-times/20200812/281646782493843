    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) pub­lished the first of its planned se­ries of weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports yes­ter­day, in con­junc­tion with the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try’s (MTI) sec­ond-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>The re­port con­tains in­for­ma­tion on the num­ber of jobs, trainee­ships and at­tach­ments avail­able, and how many of them have been filled.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said: “To help job seek­ers bet­ter ac­cess these op­por­tu­ni­ties, MOM will be pro­vid­ing weekly up­dates on the jobs sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore to highlight the op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able for job seek­ers and how they can ac­cess these op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>The move to pub­lish the weekly up­date is un­prece­dented. Even though most of the macro-level data is not new, the fre­quency at which the min­istry now chooses to pub­lish the data is sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>In­deed, MOM said that it made the lat­est move “so that mem­bers of the public can have ac­cess to im­por­tant in­for­ma­tion on a reg­u­lar and timely ba­sis”.</p>
    <p>It shows that the min­istry is re­spond­ing swiftly to the labour mar­ket that has been hit hard by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While MOM is tar­get­ing the in­for­ma­tion at job seek­ers, com­pa­nies will find the weekly up­dates use­ful too. Some em­ploy­ers can use the in­for­ma­tion to get an up-to-date pulse of the labour mar­ket to plan their man­power re­sources and fu­ture projects.</p>
    <p>While MTI’s eco­nomic data yes­ter­day showed an over­all con­trac­tion of the econ­omy, there were some sec­tors that bucked the trend. They in­cluded the elec­tron­ics, pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing and biomed­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing clus­ters in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, as well as the fi­nance and in­sur­ance, and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tors.</p>
    <p>It goes to rea­son that as these sec­tors ex­pand, the job va­can­cies will fol­low.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day that there are some 1,000 va­can­cies in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor to be filled. This is even as the sec­tor shrank by 0.7 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter this year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this in­for­ma­tion was dis­closed at a press brief­ing and not found in the jobs re­port.</p>
    <p>The weekly re­port is a work in progress and the min­istry will most def­i­nitely fine-tune and im­prove the process.</p>
    <p>There are at least two ways that the re­ports can be ex­panded to make them more mean­ing­ful to job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>One, there should be more de­tailed in­for­ma­tion like sec­tors and clus­ters that are hir­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­port now groups the jobs ac­cord­ing to short-term ones – of up to 12 months – and long-term ones. This is less use­ful be­cause job seek­ers look for jobs in sec­tors or ar­eas that match their skills, ex­pe­ri­ence and in­ter­ests, and not solely based on whether they are short- or long-term com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>Two, be­sides want­ing to know where the jobs are, job seek­ers nat­u­rally need de­tails like the ac­tual jobs be­ing of­fered, the salary range, what qual­i­fi­ca­tions are re­quired and, most im­por­tantly, how to ap­ply for them.</p>
    <p>While one can ar­gue that the var­i­ous job banks al­ready pro­vide such in­for­ma­tion, the weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port can still serve as a sign­post to point job seek­ers to these va­can­cies, or at least tell them where to start look­ing.</p>
    <p>The lat­est move by MOM is a pos­i­tive step to­wards im­prov­ing job mar­ket trans­parency. The weekly up­dates can ad­dress the in­for­ma­tion gap in the job search, which is a com­mon bug­bear among job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>And if the re­ports can be ex­panded to in­clude more de­tails to aid job seek­ers in their job hunt, this will go some dis­tance in help­ing dis­placed work­ers get back on their feet amid the pan­demic and pre­pare them for the changed post-pan­demic labour mar­ket.</p>
