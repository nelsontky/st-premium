    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion and home own­er­ship have al­ways been two very im­por­tant pil­lars in Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial se­cu­rity sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The two com­men­taries (En­sure es­tates like Toa Payoh or Ma­rine Parade are not be­yond the reach of the low-in­come; and Alumni net­works worsen in­equal­ity. Here’s one way to im­prove them, both Dec 6) have rightly pointed out how with­out con­scious and in­ten­tional so­cial en­gi­neer­ing, th­ese two pil­lars may very well be­come ob­sta­cles to low-in­come fam­i­lies up­lift­ing them­selves from the poverty trap.</p>
    <p>Look at the case of Hong Kong for hous­ing. Un­fet­tered mar­ket econ­omy and eco­nomic progress have very of­ten led to greater dis­par­ity and in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The im­per­a­tive, there­fore, falls on pol­i­cy­mak­ers to al­ways think of the un­der­priv­i­leged, so that in their plan­ning, they will al­ways try to find cre­ative ways to so­cial-en­gi­neer so­lu­tions that will en­sure the poor will al­ways have a seat at the ta­ble, while not pe­nal­is­ing the bet­ter-off for do­ing well.</p>
    <p>But no amount of so­cial en­gi­neer­ing or pol­i­cy­mak­ing can erad­i­cate in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Those who are less well-off must them­selves do the heavy lift­ing to change their lot in life. They will, as many can tes­tify, face many chal­lenges and set­backs in do­ing so. Lack­ing re­sources and con­nec­tions, they find them­selves at a dis­ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the crit­i­cal dif­fer­ence lies in what the nar­ra­tive they tell them­selves is, de­spite their sit­u­a­tion in life. Faced with sim­i­lar chal­lenges and stresses, I be­lieve they can do as well, if not bet­ter, if they pos­sess the right mind­set and nar­ra­tive: That they can be as good if not bet­ter; that they are not as well con­nected but not less ca­pa­ble; that they have less but are able to give more.</p>
