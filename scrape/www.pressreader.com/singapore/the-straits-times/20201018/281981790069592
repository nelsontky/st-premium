    <p>SYD­NEY/MEL­BOURNE • The fledg­ling travel bub­ble be­tween Aus­tralia and New Zealand hit an early snag af­ter 17 pas­sen­gers who flew into Syd­ney on Fri­day caught a con­nect­ing flight to Mel­bourne, in an ap­par­ent breach of the rules.</p>
    <p>In an ef­fort to boost tourism, Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son’s govern­ment is en­cour­ag­ing vis­i­tors from New Zealand – which has crushed com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19 – and says that they can en­ter the coun­try without hav­ing to un­dergo ho­tel quar­an­tine for 14 days.</p>
    <p>But the quar­an­tine-free travel cor­ri­dor cov­ers only New South Wales state, which is home to Syd­ney, and the North­ern Ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The 17 pas­sen­gers flew on to Mel­bourne within min­utes of ar­riv­ing in Syd­ney, and Vic­to­ria state Premier Daniel An­drews is not happy.</p>
    <p>“We are not part of this bub­ble,” he told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I have writ­ten to the Prime Min­is­ter this morn­ing and we’re dis­ap­pointed this has hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties want to trace the pas­sen­gers so they can be in­formed</p>
    <p>of lo­cal lock­down rules, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son’s act­ing Im­mi­gra­tion Min­is­ter Alan Tudge said it had been widely un­der­stood that any­one ar­riv­ing in Syd­ney from New Zealand would be free to travel on to other states – such as Vic­to­ria – that had not closed their bor­ders to New South Wales.</p>
    <p>He ac­cused Mr An­drews, who is un­der pres­sure to ease a lock­down in Mel­bourne, of try­ing to cre­ate a dis­trac­tion, the Aus­tralian news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>The lim­ited travel cor­ri­dor falls far short of the bub­ble ini­tially en­vis­aged by Mr Mor­ri­son.</p>
    <p>New Zealand is not yet re­cip­ro­cat­ing, and says any­one re­turn­ing from a trip to Aus­tralia must quar­an­tine for 14 days.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern has urged New Zealan­ders to hol­i­day at home in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Vic­to­ria recorded a sin­gle case of the dis­ease yes­ter­day – the low­est daily num­ber since early June – and no deaths.</p>
    <p>State cap­i­tal Mel­bourne, which has been the epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s Covid-19 out­break, is in its third month of a strin­gent lock­down and Mr An­drews is due to up­date plans to ease re­stric­tions across the state to­day.</p>
    <p>“We live in hope,” Pro­fes­sor Brett Sut­ton, Vic­to­ria’s chief health of­fi­cer, said at a tele­vised news con­fer­ence. Ear­lier, when the coro­n­avirus num­bers were re­leased, he said on his Twit­ter ac­count: “One. Oneder-ful.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s fed­eral govern­ment has been in­creas­ingly putting pres­sure on Mr An­drews to re­open the</p>
    <p>city and the state, with Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt say­ing on Twit­ter yes­ter­day that it was time to ease.</p>
    <p>But Mr An­drews, whose La­bor Party govern­ment is in op­po­si­tion to the con­ser­va­tive Lib­eral Party at the helm of the fed­eral govern­ment, said he would not get pres­sured.</p>
    <p>“No one should be sug­gest­ing that... (we) are keep­ing the re­stric­tions on any longer than they need to be,” he said at the news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We aren’t go­ing to risk ev­ery­thing that Vic­to­ri­ans have sac­ri­ficed.”</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing New South Wales, Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state, there were seven new cases of Covid-19, five of which were lo­cally ac­quired and most linked to an out­break at a childcare cen­tre.</p>
    <p>SOUND­ING THE ALARM</p>
    <p>We are not part of this bub­ble. I have writ­ten to the Prime Min­is­ter this morn­ing and we’re dis­ap­pointed this has hap­pened.</p>
    <p>VIC­TO­RIA STATE PREMIER DANIEL AN­DREWS, whose La­bor Party govern­ment is in op­po­si­tion to the con­ser­va­tive Lib­eral Party at the helm of the fed­eral govern­ment.</p>
