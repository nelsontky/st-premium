    <p>SYD­NEY Aus­tralian rugby fi­nally has some­thing to cheer about af­ter a tor­rid pe­riod, with pun­dits say­ing yes­ter­day their gutsy draw against the All Blacks in Welling­ton shows “brighter days may lie ahead”.</p>
    <p>The Wal­la­bies went into last Sun­day’s Bledis­loe Cup opener with a new coach, Dave Ren­nie, and un­cer­tainty about how their young line-up would fare in their first out­ing since a dis­ap­point­ing quar­ter-fi­nal exit at the Rugby World Cup in Ja­pan a year ago.</p>
    <p>But the thrilling fash­ion in which they bat­tled back to clinch a 16-16 draw, and cre­ated op­por­tu­ni­ties to win dur­ing a breath­less fi­nale, gar­nered ap­plause and even op­ti­mism that they can pull off a rare up­set in Auck­land this Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Na­tional broad­caster ABC said: “It was not a flaw­less per­for­mance from the Wal­la­bies but there were enough pos­i­tives to give Ren­nie hope his side can win the sec­ond Bledis­loe Cup Test.”</p>
    <p>It is a big call – the Wal­la­bies last won at Eden Park more than 30 years ago. But New Zealan­der Ren­nie has in­tro­duced a more tac­ti­cal ap­proach than the run­ning game of his of­ten-crit­i­cised pre­de­ces­sor Michael Cheika, who re­signed af­ter the World Cup exit to Eng­land.</p>
    <p>With three debu­tants, Filipo Dau­gunu, who scored Aus­tralia’s sec­ond try, Hunter Paisami and Harry Wil­son all im­press­ing, the Aus­tralian news­pa­per said the signs were en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>“What had lit up Sky Sta­dium on a gloomy af­ter­noon was the shin­ing ap­pre­ci­a­tion by the Wal­la­bies that they un­der­stand rugby is more than a one-di­men­sional run-at-all­costs game,” it said, in a dig at Cheika’s phi­los­o­phy.</p>
    <p>“Aus­tralia played wide, Aus­tralia played close, Aus­tralia kicked, Aus­tralia ran with pur­pose. And there wasn’t a sin­gle mem­ber of the start­ing side that would want to have the game over.”</p>
    <p>The gritty draw will help Rugby Aus­tralia put a hor­ror 18 months be­hind them, dur­ing which the Wal­la­bies slumped to sev­enth – they have since re­bounded to fifth.</p>
