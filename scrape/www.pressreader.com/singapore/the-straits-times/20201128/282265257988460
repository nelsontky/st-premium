    <p>An ex­hi­bi­tion show­cas­ing the cul­ture and her­itage of the small­est sub-eth­nic group in Sin­ga­pore’s Malay com­mu­nity opens to­day and will run for eight months.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Ban­jarese com­mu­nity, mostly hail­ing from South Kal­i­man­tan, were known here for their di­a­mond trade in the 19th and 20th cen­turies, and many set up shop in Kam­pong Intan, or Di­a­mond Vil­lage, where Jalan Pisang is to­day.</p>
    <p>A 1911 cen­sus in­di­cated there were 377 Ban­jarese in Sin­ga­pore – the largest group in the Straits Set­tle­ments then – said Ms Suhaili Os­man, a cu­ra­tor at the Malay Her­itage Cen­tre (MHC).</p>
    <p>How­ever, in a 1990 cen­sus, just 12 peo­ple iden­ti­fied them­selves as Ban­jarese, she noted.</p>
    <p>The spot­light on the Ban­jar com­mu­nity here is the MHC’s fifth ex­hi­bi­tion in its Se-Nu­san­tara se­ries of com­mu­nity co-cu­rated ex­hi­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>The Urang Ban­jar: Her­itage and Cul­ture of the Ban­jar in Sin­ga­pore ex­hi­bi­tion, will run from to­day un­til July 25.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, this year’s Malay Cul­tureFest, which was launched yes­ter­day, will also fea­ture Ban­jar cul­tural her­itage.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val runs for two weeks un­til Dec 13, and will largely take place vir­tu­ally but with in-per­son el­e­ments, due to the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the ex­hi­bi­tion and fes­ti­val’s launch yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong cited a Ban­jar id­iom, “Haram men­yarah waja sam­pai ka­put­ing”, which means “Let not the steel (of a blade) stop short un­til its very point”.</p>
    <p>He said the id­iom “is an ex­hor­ta­tion for a Ban­jar to un­der­take all en­deav­ours with de­ter­mi­na­tion, and not to give up un­til his goals are achieved”.</p>
    <p>“It is through this steely de­ter­mi­na­tion that the Ban­jar com­mu­nity and MHC have suc­ceeded in pre­sent­ing Urang Ban­jar and Malay Cul­tureFest 2020 to us, amid this pan­demic,” said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>Highlights of the fes­ti­val in­clude Kala: New Mu­sic for Game­lan Ban­jar, a game­lan per­for­mance in the Ban­jar style by ex­per­i­men­tal mu­sic group NSA Project Move­ment, and a cook­ing demon­stra­tion of Ban­jar kueh like ta­lam ban­jar and bingka ubi.</p>
    <p>Sis­ters Fari­dah Ja­mal, 58, and Fauziah Ja­mal, 64, whose father Haji Ah­mad Ja­mal worked as a di­a­mond trader and jew­eller in Jalan Pisang for most of his adult life, said they were proud of their her­itage and were hon­oured to have their sto­ries told through the ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>The sis­ters, who loaned arte­facts such as their father’s gem and di­a­mond weigh­ing tools to the MHC</p>
    <p>for the ex­hi­bi­tion, said re­count­ing their sto­ries for the show­case brought back many child­hood mem­o­ries, like that of watch­ing their father prac­tise his craft at the fam­ily’s home in the 1960s, which</p>
    <p>dou­bled as his of­fice.</p>
