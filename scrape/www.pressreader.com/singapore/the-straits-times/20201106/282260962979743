    <p>HSBC Hold­ings is su­ing the Lim fam­ily and an em­ployee of bank­rupt oil trader Hin Leong Trad­ing to re­cover US$85.3 mil­lion (S$115.7 mil­lion) of US$111.7 mil­lion that they al­legedly ob­tained with bo­gus in­voices and forged doc­u­ments, ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>HSBC, the firm’s largest cred­i­tor with about US$600 mil­lion ow­ing, is the first bank to take le­gal ac­tion against oil ty­coon Lim Oon Kuin, bet­ter known as O.K. Lim, and his two chil­dren to re­cover its losses.</p>
    <p>It is also su­ing Ms Serene Seng Hui Choo, a man­ager of Hin Leong’s cor­po­rate af­fairs depart­ment.</p>
    <p>The suit filed on Oct 21 in the High Court came two months af­ter the firm’s ju­di­cial man­ager, Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers (PwC) Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices, sued Lim, his son Evan Lim Chee Meng and daugh­ter Lim Huey Ching, both ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tors for more than 20 years, for US$3.5 bil­lion in out­stand­ing debt.</p>
    <p>PwC al­leged that they breached their fidu­ciary du­ties as di­rec­tors and en­gaged in fraud­u­lent trad­ing.</p>
    <p>The suit also comes af­ter the elder Lim was hit with two charges for abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing, re­lat­ing to a fake China Avi­a­tion Oil (Sin­ga­pore) Corp (CAO) cargo sale.</p>
    <p>The fake CAO cargo sale is the sub­ject of HSBC’s law­suit.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that if the State Courts make fac­tual find­ings in the crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings re­lated to HSBC’s claims, the bank could rely on those find­ings to bol­ster its case and po­ten­tially seek judg­ment against the Lims.</p>
    <p>HSBC al­leged that the de­fen­dants “fraud­u­lently de­ceived” the bank into lend­ing Hin Leong US$111.7 mil­lion by sign­ing forged in­voices that were sub­mit­ted to ob­tain dis­count fi­nanc­ing ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>One sales in­voice was pur­port­edly for cargo sold to CAO for US$56 mil­lion, the other for cargo sold to Unipec Sin­ga­pore for US$55.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The suit al­leges that the elder Lim had in­structed Hin Leong em­ploy­ees to “fab­ri­cate” a CAO in­ter­tank trans­fer cer­tifi­cate claim­ing the com­pany had trans­ferred 1.05</p>
    <p>mil­lion bar­rels of gasoil to CAO on March 18.</p>
    <p>But Hin Leong never sold or trans­ferred the cargo to CAO, and no cargo in­spec­tion had been con­ducted, the suit said.</p>
    <p>HSBC al­leged that the de­fen­dants “dis­guised the fact that Hin Leong was in­sol­vent” to de­ceive the bank into lend­ing it money.</p>
    <p>It said Hin Leong had suf­fered US$800 mil­lion in losses that were not re­flected in its fi­nan­cial state­ments, and that the elder Lim had told its fi­nance depart­ment to hide these losses from the ac­counts, adding that he “would be re­spon­si­ble if any­thing went wrong”.</p>
    <p>On April 9, about eight days be­fore pay­ment was due from CAO, Ms Seng, who was in charge of Hin Leong’s fi­nance and ac­counts depart­ment, al­legedly told HSBC that Hin Leong “fore­saw some ‘is­sues’ with re­pay­ment from CAO and Unipec”.</p>
    <p>She told HSBC that Hin Leong will be “re­mit­ting funds by way of a ‘refund’... and in­structed the bank to ‘set off’ these in­com­ing funds”.</p>
    <p>That day, the Lim fam­ily cred­ited US$17.5 mil­lion i nto Hin Leong’s ac­count with HSBC, the suit said. But on April 12, prior to the pay­ment due date of these in­voices, the Lims told HSBC in a tele­con­fer­ence that “due to a pur­ported ‘mis­com­mu­ni­ca­tion’ within Hin Leong, the fi­nanc­ing doc­u­ments had ‘ in­ad­ver­tently’” been sent to HSBC due to an op­er­a­tional er­ror.</p>
    <p>The Lims claimed the trans­ac­tions with CAO and Unipec “did not go through” and apol­o­gised for the “er­rors”.</p>
    <p>They also agreed to “refund” HSBC, and au­tho­rised the bank to “debit any funds stand­ing to the credit of Hin Leong’s ac­count... and to set off such funds against the amounts ow­ing to HSBC”.</p>
    <p>Be­tween April 13 and April 16, the Lim fam­ily cred­ited US$7.81 mil­lion into Hin Leong’s ac­count with HSBC, of which US$4 mil­lion was trans­ferred by Mr Evan Lim from his per­sonal ac­count, the suit said.</p>
