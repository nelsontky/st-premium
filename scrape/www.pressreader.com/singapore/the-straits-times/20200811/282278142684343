    <p>Na­tional chess play­ers cel­e­brated the Repub­lic’s 55th birth­day in style on Sun­day, by top­ping their pool in the Divi­sion 3 round of games in the In­ter­na­tional Chess Fed­er­a­tion (Fide) On­line Olympiad 2020.</p>
    <p>They were un­de­feated in all nine matchups as they fin­ished first in Pool A, ahead of Ire­land, Al­ba­nia,</p>
    <p>Malaysia, Monaco, Syria, New Zealand, Ja­pan, Hong Kong and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s top player Kevin Goh hailed the ef­forts of the young play­ers – nine from the 12-strong squad are un­der the age of 20 – and said their per­for­mances bode well for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“I was very glad to see our young play­ers step up,” said 36-year-old Goh, who in April be­came Sin­ga­pore’s first chess grand­mas­ter in 21 years.</p>
    <p>“They showed a lot of ma­tu­rity, from prepa­ra­tions for the Olympiad to the tour­na­ment it­self, and were up against some very ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers, but kept their nerve and showed com­po­sure,” added the chess player, who is ranked 738th in the world.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, who are ranked 68th in the world going by Fide’s av­er­age rat­ing of top 10 play­ers, now move into Divi­sion 2, where they will rub shoul­ders with the likes of Hun­gary (8th), Ger­many (11th) the Netherland­s (12th) and Eng­land (13th).</p>
    <p>The games will take place from Aug 14-16.</p>
    <p>To progress to the Top Divi­sion – and sub­se­quently into the play-off rounds be­tween the top 12 na­tions – teams have to fin­ish in the top three of their re­spec­tive pools.</p>
    <p>Team cap­tain Nis­ban Jas­min, who is one of three vice-pres­i­dents at the Sin­ga­pore Chess Fed­er­a­tion, said: “Although we don’t have a huge hope of ad­vanc­ing to the Top Divi­sion, we hope to give all the teams in our pool a good fight, and we will battle for ev­ery point.</p>
    <p>“In rapid games (the for­mat for the Olympiad), any­thing can hap­pen… com­pet­ing against stronger play­ers will be a good learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence too for our young play­ers.”</p>
    <p>Added Goh: “(To ad­vance) is not im­pos­si­ble, but ev­ery­body will have to play the tour­na­ment of our lives.</p>
    <p>“Still, we might be un­der­dogs, but we won’t be there just to make up the num­bers.”</p>
    <p>The Fide On­line Olympiad is a unique on­line tour­na­ment that fea­tures 163 na­tions and over 1,500 play­ers, and is the largest chess tour­na­ment this year.</p>
    <p>It was or­gan­ised af­ter the 2020 edi­tion of the bi­en­nial tra­di­tional Chess Olympiad – which dates back to 1924 – was post­poned to next year ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Said Fide pres­i­dent Arkady Dvorkovich: “Such (a tra­di­tional) gath­er­ing is not phys­i­cally pos­si­ble un­der the cur­rent cir­cum­stances (but) the On­line Olympiad will serve the pur­pose of re­mind­ing us of these im­por­tant con­cepts: the cel­e­bra­tion of di­ver­sity, the ex­change of ideas, the sports­man­ship, and the mu­tual re­spect be­tween peo­ple and cul­tures.”</p>
