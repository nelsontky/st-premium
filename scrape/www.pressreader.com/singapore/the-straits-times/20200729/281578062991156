    <p>Air­craft re­pair com­pany Ea­gle Services Asia has re­futed ru­mours that it has laid off over 140 work­ers. It says some em­ploy­ees are on paid leave while the firm ne­go­ti­ates with the unions over jobs.</p>
    <p>Air­craft main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul com­pany Ea­gle Services Asia has re­futed ru­mours that it re­trenched over 140 staff last week, telling The Straits Times that no em­ployee has been con­firmed as re­trenched as yet, and all staff con­tinue to be on its pay­roll.</p>
    <p>The firm is locked in ne­go­ti­a­tions with the unions to find ways to keep as many jobs as pos­si­ble, even as it put some of its staff on tem­po­rary paid leave to await the out­come.</p>
    <p>Some em­ploy­ees had been called into a 10-minute brief­ing last Wed­nes­day morn­ing, where they were told to go on paid leave un­til the ne­go­ti­a­tions are com­plete.</p>
    <p>More than 140 staff, in­clud­ing tech­ni­cians and en­gi­neers, were re­port­edly placed on its re­trench­ment list, with most of them Sin­ga­pore­ans. Some were told to leave their work­place im­me­di­ately, while oth­ers were said to be de­nied en­try.</p>
    <p>Ea­gle Services Asia, how­ever, has re­futed the re­trench­ment ru­mours and told ST yes­ter­day that no staff mem­ber was barred from en­ter­ing its premises. It con­firmed that some af­fected em­ploy­ees have been al­lowed to take paid leave to wait for the out­come of the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This has come in the face of a “cus­tomer-driven vol­ume de­cline”, said the com­pany, which is a joint ven­ture between SIA En­gi­neer­ing Com­pany and Amer­i­can aerospace man­u­fac­turer Pratt & Whit­ney.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this pan­demic, it is a dif­fi­cult time for all busi­nesses. The avi­a­tion in­dus­try, among oth­ers, has been im­pacted par­tic­u­larly hard,” it said. “We have had to make ad­just­ments to the busi­ness. Staff de­par­tures are never easy.”</p>
    <p>Af­fected em­ploy­ees – some of whom have been with the firm for decades – have ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment with the way the man­age­ment han­dled the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>One tech­ni­cian, who was at the brief­ing, was asked to leave the premises im­me­di­ately. Dur­ing the meet­ing, the man­age­ment did not di­rectly men­tion re­trench­ment but “it was ob­vi­ous”, said the em­ployee, who was told to re­turn on Aug 3 or, when ne­go­ti­a­tions are done, to sign a let­ter and clear out his locker.</p>
    <p>“It was shock­ing, we weren’t no­ti­fied be­fore­hand,” said the staff mem­ber, who was es­corted out by the man­age­ment. “Many of us have spent the past few days won­der­ing if our names would be on that fi­nal list. It is not fair to put us through that.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany handed out four­month bonuses a few months ago, said some em­ploy­ees, who are baf­fled by the need for lay­offs.</p>
    <p>“They can give that much bonus, but how is it they are not able to re­tain us?” asked a tech­ni­cian, who has been with the com­pany for more than 30 years. He added that his sec­tion could lose three tech­ni­cians, in­clud­ing him­self.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions between the com­pany and the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as well as unions, in­clud­ing the Air-Trans­port Ex­ec­u­tive Staff Union, SIA En­gi­neer­ing Com­pany En­gi­neers and Ex­ec­u­tives Union and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Staff Union, are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>On Ea­gle Services Asia’s re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, NTUC told ST: “Our pri­or­ity at the mo­ment is to en­sure that the work­ers in the com­pany are treated fairly and with dig­nity.”</p>
