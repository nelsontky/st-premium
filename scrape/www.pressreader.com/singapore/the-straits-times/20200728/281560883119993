    </section>

    <p>China has matched the re­cent US broad­sides with tem­pered tit-for-tat moves, such as over the clo­sure of con­sulates. Bei­jing is not un­aware of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion’s im­pact on Wash­ing­ton’s foreign pol­icy, but it is also plan­ning for more trou­ble ahead even af­ter the elec­tion, says China bureau chief Tan Dawn Wei.</p>
    <p>An­other week, an­other fresh round of China bash­ing from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. This time, it came as an un­prece­dented move to shut a Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, where shocked diplo­mats ac­cused of com­mit­ting se­ri­ous es­pi­onage quickly got to work burn­ing clas­si­fied doc­u­ments be­fore they left the building af­ter a 72-hour dead­line.</p>
    <p>True to the Chi­nese prin­ci­ple of rec­i­proc­ity, Bei­jing re­turned the “favour” by clos­ing the United States di­plo­matic mis­sion in Chengdu, sim­i­larly giv­ing the Amer­i­cans three days to get out.</p>
    <p>If po­lit­i­cal pun­dits are right in la­belling this lat­est provo­ca­tion by Wash­ing­ton as an elec­toral move to get Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­other four years in the White House, the next 100 days could leave all con­cerned breath­less as to what might fol­low. What’s more, things could get worse as the Nov 3 elec­tion draws nearer while Mr Trump’s cur­rent dis­mal poll rat­ings fail to im­prove.</p>
    <p>There ap­pears to be sim­i­lar ex­pec­ta­tions in Bei­jing, which has greeted the bar­rage of bans, sanc­tions, ex­pul­sions, ar­rests and sear­ing rhetoric from Wash­ing­ton with equally tough words, but rel­a­tive re­straint in ac­tions as it awaits the out­come of the White House race.</p>
    <p>“I’m not sure how the Chi­nese would re­act de­pend­ing on who’s the win­ner. But in its es­ti­ma­tion, if Trump does win a sec­ond pres­i­dency, I think China ex­pects that Trump will hold back some of these mea­sures and re­cal­i­brate Amer­ica’s ap­proach to China,” says Dr Hoo Tiang Boon, who stud­ies US-China re­la­tions at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“I think some of the hawk­ish mem­bers in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion may think this could pos­si­bly be their last chance to do things they want against China. So they’re el­e­vat­ing some of their ac­tions,” he adds.</p>
    <p>That this year’s elec­tion sea­son has co­in­cided with a pan­demic that orig­i­nated in China and is cost­ing Mr Trump at the na­tional polls against ri­val Joe Bi­den also make for a con­vinc­ing ar­gu­ment that the US leader is pun­ish­ing Bei­jing while de­flect­ing at­ten­tion from his poor han­dling of the out­break.</p>
    <p>So far, China’s re­sponse to the US’ broad­sides has been tem­pered tit-for-tat moves, such as choos­ing to tar­get the Chengdu US con­sulate in­stead of the larger mis­sions in Hong Kong, Shang­hai or Guangzhou.</p>
    <p>That said, if the Amer­i­cans are us­ing the Chengdu base to col­lect data on the sen­si­tive western re­gions of Xin­jiang and Ti­bet, then Bei­jing’s cal­cu­lus could also have fac­tored in its de­sire to un­der­mine such ef­forts.</p>
    <p>CONCILIATI­ON NOT CON­FRONTA­TION</p>
    <p>It was only three weeks ago that Foreign Min­is­ter Wang Yi urged the US to come to the ta­ble, hold­ing out an olive branch and the prom­ise of di­a­logue on any­thing the US so chooses.</p>
    <p>Out­lin­ing ways to mend their frayed ties, Mr Wang said both sides have much to of­fer each other and called for “more ob­jec­tive and cool-headed per­cep­tions about China, and a more ra­tio­nal and prag­matic China pol­icy”.</p>
    <p>A day af­ter, his Amer­i­can coun­ter­part, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, snubbed him with the US’ strong­est re­marks on the South China Sea yet, by call­ing China’s mar­itime claims “com­pletely un­law­ful”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump fol­lowed up a day later by sign­ing into law the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act that man­dates sanc­tions against of­fi­cials who im­pose the spe­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive re­gion’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law, and strip­ping the city of its spe­cial trad­ing sta­tus.</p>
    <p>There have been a host of other puni­tive ac­tions: visa re­stric­tions on party of­fi­cials over trans­gres­sions in Xin­jiang and Ti­bet, sanc­tions on com­pa­nies for their con­nec­tion to Xin­jiang’s forced labour pro­grammes, and charg­ing Chi­nese hack­ers for al­legedly steal­ing Amer­i­can trade secrets and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Last week, the US au­thor­i­ties also ar­rested four Chi­nese re­searchers – in­clud­ing a woman who had sought refuge at the Chi­nese con­sulate in San Fran­cisco – for not declar­ing their af­fil­i­a­tion with the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army on their visa ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>While it is obvious China hawks have the up­per hand in Wash­ing­ton and have pretty much dropped the veil of not be­ing out to con­tain the East Asia gi­ant, it is less clear how much sway Amer­ica hawks have within the opaque Chi­nese lead­er­ship. Or, how much of a split there is within the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party on how to deal with an in­creas­ingly com­bat­ive US that views China as an ex­is­ten­tial threat.</p>
    <p>But mu­tual trust is lost, and the Chi­nese are acutely aware that even if a new or re­turn­ing pres­i­dent brings down the heat af­ter the Novem­ber elec­tion, a bi­par­ti­san ef­fort will con­tinue to come af­ter China on ev­ery­thing from trade and tech to hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>HOPE FOR THE BEST, PRE­PARE FOR THE WORST</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has been pre­par­ing the coun­try for this even­tu­al­ity, em­pha­sis­ing on sev­eral oc­ca­sions in re­cent months the im­por­tance of pur­su­ing a new de­vel­op­ment strat­egy of “do­mes­tic cir­cu­la­tion” and mov­ing away from ex­port-led growth.</p>
    <p>Last week, in a meet­ing with some of China’s top tech bosses, he urged them to be pa­tri­otic, to in­no­vate and also to har­ness the strengths of their coun­try’s for­mi­da­ble do­mes­tic mar­ket in the face of ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism, a bat­tered global econ­omy and other na­tions mov­ing to cor­rect over-re­liance on China.</p>
    <p>This do­mes­tic cir­cu­la­tion sys­tem will re­quire China to ramp up work on smoothen­ing its in­dus­trial sup­ply chains across the coun­try, par­tic­u­larly in the less-de­vel­oped western re­gion.</p>
    <p>While this pivot to boost­ing do­mes­tic con­sump­tion is not new, it has taken on ur­gency in the wake of the Covid-19 cri­sis and US threats of de­cou­pling.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 40 years of re­form and open­ing up that have trans­formed the poverty-stricken na­tion into the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy, it has now found it­self look­ing in­wards once more.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi cer­tainly has no de­sire to draw the bam­boo cur­tains again. Glob­al­i­sa­tion has been a god­send to China, al­low­ing it to lift hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple out of poverty and cre­ate a mid­dle class of 400 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese have trav­elled, stud­ied, lived in world cities and tasted the fruits of such global con­nect­ed­ness. If China be­comes, whether of its own do­ing, alien­ated or iso­lated from the world, the Com­mu­nist Party could well have to deal with mil­lions of un­happy Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>So, while its wolf war­rior diplo­mats and stri­dent state me­dia con­tinue to chew up the US and other Western lib­eral democ­ra­cies when anti-China ac­tions are taken, con­cil­ia­tory mes­sag­ing still has a part to play. Or at least, China hopes.</p>
    <p>REGIME CHANGE</p>
    <p>Yet, it is fac­ing a hos­til­ity from the world’s might­i­est coun­try that seems bent on fix­ing it – one never seen in five decades of en­gage­ment.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Pom­peo sig­nalled an an­tag­o­nis­tic new China pol­icy that pit­ted the free world – and the Chi­nese peo­ple – against the Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>In a speech in­ter­preted as call­ing for regime change, Mr Pom­peo warned: “If we don’t act now, ul­ti­mately the CCP will erode our free­doms and sub­vert the rules-based or­der that our so­ci­eties have worked so hard to build. If we bend the knee now, our chil­dren’s chil­dren may be at the mercy of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, whose ac­tions are the pri­mary chal­lenge to­day in the free world.”</p>
    <p>The US has been mak­ing a con­scious ef­fort to frame its de­mon­i­sa­tion of China as tar­get­ing the party, and not the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>News two weeks ago that the au­thor­i­ties were con­sid­er­ing ban­ning Com­mu­nist Party mem­bers and their fam­i­lies from the US was met with ridicule, with the Chi­nese Foreign Min­istry call­ing it “pa­thetic”.</p>
    <p>The party has 92 mil­lion mem­bers, among them bil­lion­aires and farm­ers. With this blan­ket ban, the US could be shun­ning more than 300 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>If the strat­egy is to turn the Chi­nese against its own govern­ment and bring about a regime change, there is no ev­i­dence right now to sug­gest that will suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>On the con­trary, re­cent provoca­tive moves by the US have had the op­po­site ef­fect in China. When the US shut the Hous­ton con­sulate, scores of Chi­nese ne­ti­zens went on so­cial me­dia call­ing for their lead­ers to re­cip­ro­cate with a sim­i­lar shut­down of a US mis­sion. While Mr Trump was once pop­u­lar among or­di­nary and re­form-minded Chi­nese, he is now seen as hav­ing gone off his rocker – a por­trayal per­pet­u­ated by state me­dia out­lets like the hawk­ish Global Times, which lately has been rel­ish­ing in call­ing Mr Trump and his co­terie “crazy” and “mad”.</p>
    <p>And then there’s the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the pro­pa­ganda play by the Chi­nese me­dia to con­trast China’s tough but ef­fec­tive han­dling of the out­break with the run­away in­fec­tion num­bers in the US.</p>
    <p>A re­cent re­port pub­lished by the China Data Lab at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia San Diego showed that in three of its most re­cent sur­veys of 1,000 ur­ban res­i­dents in China, trust in cen­tral and lo­cal gov­ern­ments and sup­port of the Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal sys­tem saw “re­mark­able growth”, while favourable opin­ion of the US dipped.</p>
    <p>The sur­veys showed trust in the cen­tral govern­ment, on a scale of 1 to 10, in­creased steadily from 8.23 in June last year, to 8.65 in Fe­bru­ary this year, and to 8.87 in May.</p>
    <p>Views on the US went the other way, drop­ping from 5.77 in June last year, to 4.77 in May this year.</p>
    <p>IDE­O­LOG­I­CAL WAR</p>
    <p>With the US now wag­ing an ide­o­log­i­cal war against China, the fu­ture looks grim for this re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>“The US and China have huge con­tra­dic­tions in this re­spect, and it is prob­a­bly dif­fi­cult to rec­on­cile,” said Dr Zhao Tong from the Carnegie-Ts­inghua Cen­tre for Global Pol­icy in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“The US sees an in­creas­ingly fierce col­li­sion of ide­olo­gies, but for China, this ide­o­log­i­cal is­sue is not up for dis­cus­sion. Main­tain­ing its ex­ist­ing ide­ol­ogy is with­out ques­tion China’s high­est po­lit­i­cal prin­ci­ple. And there is no room to dis­cuss this do­mes­ti­cally ei­ther.”</p>
    <p>The worry is that both sides will grow in­creas­ingly hos­tile in this stand-off, lead­ing to these two ma­jor world pow­ers un­able to un­der­stand each other while con­tin­u­ing to en­gage in fierce eco­nomic, tech­nol­ogy and mil­i­tary com­pe­ti­tion, said Dr Zhao.</p>
    <p>Much has been said about a new Cold War but the com­par­i­son fails in many ways, not least be­cause the con­test then was be­tween two op­pos­ing pow­ers who were mostly agreed on the rules of the game, but with the Soviet Union be­ing far too weak eco­nom­i­cally to cham­pion its val­ues.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s China is far stronger than the Gor­bachev-era Soviet Union and is un­likely to give up what it has achieved, ei­ther eco­nom­i­cally, tech­no­log­i­cally or in global lead­er­ship. Even a Bi­den pres­i­dency will find it im­pos­si­ble to re­turn to the Obama play­book af­ter the changes un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Ba­si­cally, there is no play­book for this evolv­ing great power strug­gle for supremacy. And that is per­haps the most fear­ful thing.</p>
