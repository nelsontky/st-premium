    <p>A drunk pas­sen­ger on a pub­lic bus flew into a rage and at­tacked the driver af­ter the lat­ter told him to stop bang­ing on the handrails.</p>
    <p>Seng Oh Kwang hit Mr Thava­mani Kr­ish­nan 11 times on board SBS bus ser­vice 186 be­tween 11.50pm and 11.55pm on Aug 16 last year.</p>
    <p>The 69-year-old Sin­ga­porean was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to six weeks’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count each of as­sault and pub­lic drunk­en­ness.</p>
    <p>On the day of the in­ci­dent, Seng met some friends for a drink­ing ses­sion at an Up­per Cross Street cof­fee shop at around 7pm, and he downed more than six bot­tles of beer.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Kor Zhen Hong said that Seng was “heav­ily in­tox­i­cated” by the time he left the eatery some time be­fore 11pm.</p>
    <p>Seng boarded t he dou­bledecker bus at around 11.15pm and about 25 minutes later, Mr Thava­mani, 70, heard bang­ing noises as he was driv­ing the bus along Far­rer Road.</p>
    <p>The driver stopped the bus, con­ducted a check and saw that Seng was us­ing his hands to bang against the handrails. Seng was un­happy when the driver told him to stop his ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “Sub­se­quently, from around 11.42pm to around 11.55pm, the ac­cused pe­ri­od­i­cally con­fronted the vic­tim and, on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions, grabbed the vic­tim’s shirt and hit the vic­tim on his face.”</p>
    <p>The po­lice were alerted, and Mr Thava­mani locked the bus doors while wait­ing for of­fi­cers to ar­rive.</p>
    <p>Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage of the at­tack showed Seng re­peat­edly grab­bing the driver’s shirt and strik­ing his head mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>Some pas­sen­gers re­mained on the up­per deck to avoid Seng. Mr Thava­mani could not con­tinue driv­ing the bus that evening be­cause of the at­tack.</p>
    <p>The driver was later taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal where he was found with in­juries in­clud­ing bleed­ing from a blood ves­sel over the whites of his right eye. He was dis­charged the next day and placed on med­i­cal leave for three days.</p>
    <p>Seng’s bail was set at $5,000 yes­ter­day and he will sur­ren­der him­self at the State Courts on Oct 14 to be­gin his jail term.</p>
    <p>For as­sault, he could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000.</p>
