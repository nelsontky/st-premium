    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON/BRUS­SELS The Euro­pean Union stepped up plan­ning for a “no-deal” Brexit yes­ter­day af­ter the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment re­fused to re­voke an ul­ti­ma­tum on break­ing the di­vorce treaty that Brus­sels says will sink four years of talks.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s gov­ern­ment said ex­plic­itly this week that it plans to break in­ter­na­tional law by breach­ing parts of the with­drawal agree­ment treaty that it signed in Jan­uary, when it for­mally left the bloc.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain says the move is aimed at clar­i­fy­ing am­bi­gu­i­ties, but it caused a new cri­sis in talks less than four months be­fore the United King­dom is due to com­plete its de­par­ture from the EU’s or­bit when a tran­si­tion pe­riod ends in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The EU has de­manded that Bri­tain scrap the plan to breach the di­vorce treaty by the end of this month. Bri­tain has re­fused, say­ing its Par­lia­ment is sov­er­eign, and above in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>“As the United King­dom looks to what kind of fu­ture trade re­la­tion­ship it wants with the Euro­pean Union, a pre­req­ui­site for that is hon­our­ing agree­ments that are al­ready in place,” said Mr Paschal Dono­hoe, chair­man of euro zone fi­nance min­is­ters. “It is im­per­a­tive that the gov­ern­ment of the United King­dom re­spond back to the call from the (Euro­pean) Com­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>The EU yes­ter­day said it will con­sider its next steps with Bri­tain af­ter the end-September dead­line it has set for Lon­don to scrap a plan to breach the terms of its with­drawal agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“We have set a dead­line for the UK and there­fore... we are go­ing to take this step by step,” Euro­pean Com­mis­sion spokesman Eric Mamer told a news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The EU’s chief ne­go­tia­tor, Mr Michel Barnier, had said on Thurs­day, af­ter trade talks in Lon­don, that the bloc was in­creas­ing its plan­ning for a no-deal Brexit at the end of this year, adding: “The UK has not en­gaged in a re­cip­ro­cal way on fun­da­men­tal EU prin­ci­ples and in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Euro­pean Com­mis­sion vice-pres­i­dent Maros Se­f­covic urged Bri­tain to scrap the main el­e­ments of new leg­is­la­tion put for­ward this week that would over­ride parts of the with­drawal agree­ment. But Bri­tain said its Par­lia­ment would de­bate the Bill on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Bill is ex­pected to face op­po­si­tion in both Houses of Par­lia­ment as many se­nior Bri­tish politi­cians have ex­pressed shock that Lon­don is ex­plic­itly plan­ning to breach in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment will have to think again,” said Mr Nor­man La­mont, a Brexit-sup­port­ing mem­ber of the House of Lords, the Up­per Cham­ber, who was fi­nance min­is­ter when the pound crashed out of the Ex­change Rate Mech­a­nism in 1992.</p>
    <p>“I don’t t hink t his will get through the Lords, in its present form,” Mr La­mont said. “It is im­pos­si­ble to de­fend. They’ll have to think again.”</p>
