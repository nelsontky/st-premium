    <p>Two weeks ago, Ten­cent, China’s In­ter­net and gam­ing be­he­moth, an­nounced it was cre­at­ing a re­gional hub in Sin­ga­pore to tap the fast-grow­ing South-east Asia mar­ket. The news came on the heels of other Chi­nese tech gi­ants set­ting up big­ger shops in the Re­pub­lic, as they face push-back in the US, In­dia and other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>ByteDance, the par­ent com­pany of video-shar­ing app TikTok, was re­ported by Bloomberg to be plan­ning to in­vest bil­lions of dol­lars and gen­er­ate hun­dreds of jobs in Sin­ga­pore over the next three years. And Alibaba has sunk at least $5 bil­lion into buy­ing Lazada, which it claims has be­come South-east Asia’s top e-com­merce plat­form based on av­er­age monthly Web vis­its.</p>
    <p>The three Chi­nese com­pa­nies are also eye­ing a dig­i­tal-bank li­cence from the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia has de­scribed these global ex­pan­sion plans as shrewd moves to cap­ture a mar­ket of 640 mil­lion in South-east Asia, one that will boast 310 mil­lion dig­i­tal con­sumers by the end of this year, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent re­port by Face­book and Bain.</p>
    <p>And Sin­ga­pore is well placed to play host, say the me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore and China have small cul­tural dif­fer­ences, sim­i­lar ad­min­is­tra­tive sys­tems and lower com­mu­ni­ca­tion costs,” wrote Pro­fes­sor Pan Helin of the In­sti­tute of Dig­i­tal Econ­omy at Zhong­nan Univer­sity of Eco­nom­ics and Law in the Com­mu­nist Party pa­per Global Times. “China’s dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy ra­di­ates across South-east Asia with Sin­ga­pore as the hub, and then con­tin­ues to reach overseas mar­kets in South-east Asia. This is a more ra­tio­nal and safe choice in the cur­rent global geopo­lit­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion cli­mate.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, on its part, has been woo­ing Chi­nese firms to use the Re­pub­lic as a launch pad to the re­gion, by of­fer­ing pro­fes­sional ser­vices, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty man­age­ment and fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship has, for the past four decades, been an­chored by eco­nomic ties.</p>
    <p>Since 2013, China has been Sin­ga­pore’s largest trad­ing part­ner, while Sin­ga­pore has been China’s big­gest for­eign in­vestor. Two-way trade reached $135 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries also inked a bumper crop of deals at their last apex bi­lat­eral sum­mit, the Joint Coun­cil for Bi­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion meet­ing last Oc­to­ber, sig­nalling a new chap­ter in the re­la­tion­ship as Sin­ga­pore shifts to a new gen­er­a­tion of po­lit­i­cal lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The level of eco­nomic in­ter­de­pen­dence will con­tinue to in­crease, say Chi­nese an­a­lysts who point to the grow­ing num­ber of col­lab­o­ra­tive projects and pacts be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The two have mul­ti­ple in­ter-gov­ern­men­tal projects in China, in­clud­ing Suzhou In­dus­trial Park, Tian­jin Eco-city, Chongqing Con­nec­tiv­ity Ini­tia­tive and Guangzhou Knowl­edge City, and plan to take their col­lab­o­ra­tive ex­pe­ri­ence in high-qual­ity in­dus­trial parks to other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion is im­por­tant in main­tain­ing the healthy de­vel­op­ment of the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship,” said Dr Fan Lei, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Sin­ga­pore Stud­ies at Shan­dong Univer­sity of Po­lit­i­cal Sci­ence and Law. “Sin­ga­pore is a small coun­try and is more de­pen­dent on the global mar­ket, and its ex­port-ori­ented econ­omy dove­tails with China’s cur­rent de­vel­op­ment strat­egy.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was among the first coun­tries to sup­port China’s am­bi­tious Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, an in­fras­truc­ture de­vel­op­ment blue­print launched in 2013 that spans land and sea routes to cre­ate a global trad­ing net­work. One-third of all Chi­nese in­vest­ments to Belt and Road coun­tries now flow through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>That the re­la­tion­ship has pro­gressed largely smoothly over the past 30 years since for­mal diplo­matic re­la­tions were es­tab­lished is thanks to the prag­ma­tism adopted by the lead­ers of the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“For coun­tries to have friendly re­la­tions, the start­ing point is find­ing com­mon ground based on mu­tual ben­e­fit,” said Pro­fes­sor Lu Yuanli, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Sin­ga­pore Stud­ies at Shen­zhen Univer­sity. “Sin­ga­pore’s strength is it is con­stantly think­ing about how it can add value to other coun­tries, and that will cer­tainly be ben­e­fi­cial in main­tain­ing a good re­la­tion­ship with China.”</p>
    <p>THE U.S. FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>De­spite the strong trade ties be­tween the two coun­tries, China’s in­vest­ment in the Re­pub­lic still trails be­hind that of the United States – Sin­ga­pore’s No. 1 source of for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment – by a long way.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures from Sin­ga­pore’s De­part­ment of Statis­tics show that in 2018, the US pumped in $289 bil­lion, against China’s $41 bil­lion, even though China’s stock of di­rect in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore has been in­creas­ing 10 per cent each year on av­er­age since 2010.</p>
    <p>There has long been an un­easi­ness in Bei­jing over Sin­ga­pore’s cosy con­nec­tion and strate­gic part­ner­ship with the US, par­tic­u­larly in de­fence co­op­er­a­tion. While geopo­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions fac­tor large in the dis­com­fort, at the Chi­nese grass­roots level the sore­ness is more emo­tive – Sin­ga­pore, be­ing the only coun­try other than China with an eth­nic Chi­nese ma­jor­ity, should stand with China, so goes the ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>“There are in­deed in­sep­a­ra­ble cul­tural links and kin­ship be­tween the two coun­tries, and this is surely ben­e­fi­cial to the growth of the re­la­tion­ship, and is what sets it apart from China’s re­la­tion­ship with other coun­tries,” said Prof Lu.</p>
    <p>But from an of­fi­cial stand­point, there is recog­ni­tion and ac­cep­tance that Sin­ga­pore is a sovereign coun­try free to make its own for­eign pol­icy choices.</p>
    <p>“As long as the Sin­ga­pore-US re­la­tion­ship does not af­fect China’s na­tional in­ter­ests, also whether in South-east Asia or the South China Sea, China will not in­ter­fere in the de­vel­op­ment of the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship,” said Dr Fan.</p>
    <p>“But once those na­tional in­ter­ests are some­how threat­ened, then I think the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s at­ti­tude may change.”</p>
    <p>The bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship has, for the past four decades, been an­chored by eco­nomic ties. Since 2013, China has been Sin­ga­pore’s largest trad­ing part­ner, while Sin­ga­pore has been China’s big­gest for­eign in­vestor. Two-way trade reached $135 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
