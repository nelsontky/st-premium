    <p>Just over a month af­ter a dev­as­tat­ing ex­plo­sion de­stroyed a large chunk of the Le­banese cap­i­tal and killed al­most 200 peo­ple, France re­mains Le­banon’s most sig­nif­i­cant in­ter­na­tional spon­sor.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, the first for­eign leader to visit Beirut less than 48 hours af­ter the Aug 4 disas­ter, not only kept his prom­ise to re­turn to Le­banon for the sec­ond time in or­der to re­view progress on the ground, but re­cently also un­veiled a French plan for the coun­try’s re­con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>This in­volve­ment is part of a broader French en­gage­ment in the Mid­dle East which has taken most diplo­mats by sur­prise. Still, the ob­sta­cles fac­ing France re­main daunt­ing. It is com­mon to ex­plain</p>
    <p>France’s at­ten­tion to Le­banon as due to old colo­nial habits; Le­banon was one of the few Mid­dle Eastern coun­tries ruled by France. But for­mal French colo­nial rule lasted only dur­ing the two decades be­tween the first and sec­ond world wars; the links be­tween the two na­tions are deeper, and of a more cul­tural na­ture.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, over 150,000 peo­ple of Le­banese ori­gin now live in France, refugees from that coun­try’s var­i­ous re­li­gious wars.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that Mr Macron has al­ways re­garded Le­banon as France’s spe­cial part­ner in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter he was elected in 2017, he be­came em­broiled in a Le­banese po­lit­i­cal cri­sis af­ter Mr Saad Hariri, the then Le­banese Prime Min­is­ter, was forced to re­sign un­der pres­sure from Saudi Ara­bia. Mr Macron not only in­ter­vened in this row be­tween two Arab na­tions, but also suc­ceeded in get­ting Mr Hariri re­in­stated as the head of the Le­banese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The episode was hailed at that time as a French-led re­buff to both Saudi Ara­bia and Iran, the re­gional pow­ers ac­cused of med­dling in Le­banon’s do­mes­tic pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron rushed to lead the</p>
    <p>in­ter­na­tional re­con­struc­tion ef­fort af­ter the ex­plo­sion. This time, he also vowed to se­cure “Le­banon’s re­con­struc­tion re­quire­ments with­out in­ter­fer­ence”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this hardly does jus­tice to the sheer scale of France’s in­ter­ven­tion in that coun­try. For Paris is re­spon­si­ble for set­ting up an in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ence of po­ten­tial donors soon af­ter the hu­man­i­tar­ian emer­gency started. The French have raised €250 mil­lion (S$404 mil­lion) to fi­nance im­me­di­ate needs and are lead­ing a</p>
    <p>con­sor­tium to re­con­struct Beirut’s sea­port and its sur­round­ings, as a new fi­nan­cial cen­tre.</p>
    <p>But it is Mr Macron’s po­lit­i­cal as­pi­ra­tions for Le­banon which look most ques­tion­able.</p>
    <p>By walk­ing through the streets of Beirut af­ter the blasts and by stat­ing that the disas­ter re­quires a rein­ven­tion of Le­banon’s po­lit­i­cal ar­range­ments, he made him­self widely pop­u­lar. He is now per­ceived as the true voice of the or­di­nary Le­banese, most of whom are dis­gusted with their old and failed po­lit­i­cal elite.</p>
    <p>His ap­peal to the Le­banese to leave be­hind their di­vi­sions be­tween Sunni and Shi’ite Mus­lims or be­tween Mus­lims and Chris­tians and form a new gov­ern­ment free of cor­rup­tion and nepo­tism make sense. So does his agenda of re­struc­tur­ing the fi­nan­cial sec­tor and cen­tral bank, and in­sti­tut­ing a wider au­dit of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Scram­bling to re­spond to the shock of the cri­sis, all of Le­banon’s main po­lit­i­cal ac­tors are now sound­ing con­cil­ia­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Has­san Nas­ral­lah, the boss of Hizbol­lah, the Ira­nian-funded mili­tia which claims to rep­re­sent Le­banon’s Shi’ite Mus­lims, said he is “open to a con­struc­tive dis­cus­sion” about a “new po­lit­i­cal pact”, as sug­gested by Mr Macron.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Le­banese Pres­i­dent Michel Aoun, who in ac­cor­dance with the Con­sti­tu­tion must be a Chris­tian, is sud­denly call­ing for the emer­gence of a “sec­u­lar state” in his coun­try, some­thing which Mr Macron also ev­i­dently sup­ports. The gov­ern­ment is now run by Mr Mustapha Adib, a Sunni Mus­lim di­plo­mat, who claims to have no po­lit­i­cal am­bi­tions apart from putting to­gether a Cabi­net of ca­pa­ble ad­min­is­tra­tors.</p>
    <p>Still, ob­sta­cles to rec­on­cil­i­a­tion are phe­nom­e­nal. For, af­ter half a cen­tury of do­mes­tic strife, every com­mu­nity in Le­banon re­lies on in­for­mal sources of rev­enue, and the na­tional cof­fers are empty.</p>
    <p>The idea that France would be able to recre­ate the state from scratch – which is re­ally what is needed – re­mains fan­ci­ful. Still, that does not pre­vent the French Pres­i­dent from try­ing. For, as Mr Macron sees it, with the rest of Europe dis­in­ter­ested and the United States largely ab­sent from the Mid­dle East, France is now the only coun­try ca­pa­ble of shoul­der­ing the bur­den of avert­ing the col­lapse of yet an­other coun­try in that re­gion.</p>
