    <p>There have been new cases de­tected at dor­mi­to­ries de­clared to be cleared of the coro­n­avirus, and the au­thor­i­ties are mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion to man­age the risk of new out­breaks.</p>
    <p>A joint state­ment by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity, Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and Health Pro­mo­tion Board yes­ter­day pointed to fresh in­fec­tions in cleared dorms, with­out pro­vid­ing any de­tails on the num­bers af­fected.</p>
    <p>It said safe­guards have been put in place to en­sure the in­ten­sive ef­forts spent on dorms over the past four months do not go to waste.</p>
    <p>This comes as MOM yes­ter­day also said all dorms, with the ex­cep­tion of 17 blocks in six pur­pose-built dorms which serve as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, are now clear of the virus.</p>
    <p>With the lat­est clear­ance, four in five – or 315,000 – work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors have been given the green light to re­sume work. This is com­pared with the 68 per cent – or 265,000 work­ers – in these sec­tors who had been given ap­proval to start work last week.</p>
    <p>Some 22,500 work­ers re­main in gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and the 17 blocks. “With more daily move­ments in and out of the dor­mi­to­ries, it is even more im­por­tant for ev­ery­one to re­main vig­i­lant to guard against new in­fec­tions,” the joint state­ment by the four agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures in place to en­sure work­ers can safely restart work in­clude re­quir­ing them to re­port their tem­per­a­ture and any symp­toms of acute res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness through an app twice a day.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries and those who work on site in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors will also have to be swab-tested once ev­ery 14 days. Em­ploy­ers should space out the test­ing of their work­ers so that the au­thor­i­ties are able to “main­tain con­stant sur­veil­lance of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Work­ers who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 are not re­quired to un­dergo reg­u­lar test­ing for 180 days.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures in­clude stag­gered pickup and drop-off times for work­ers to and from their work sites, up­dat­ing work­ers’ res­i­dence ad­dresses and min­imis­ing mix­ing be­tween blocks. Waste water from high­er­risk dorms is closely mon­i­tored for traces of the virus, and the num­ber of work­ers who re­port sick at any med­i­cal post is tracked as early in­di­ca­tions of pos­si­ble clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Plans are in place to quickly quar­an­tine and iso­late at-risk work­ers if a po­ten­tial in­fec­tion sur­faces.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore com­pleted test­ing of all 323,000 work­ers in dorms last Fri­day, with about nine in 10 work­ers hav­ing re­cov­ered or been found to be free of the virus as of last week.</p>
