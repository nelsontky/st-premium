    <p>CHEN­NAI (In­dia) • A pop­u­lar ac­tor, who was set to star as Sri Lanka’s leg­endary spin­ner Mut­tiah Mu­ralitha­ran in a biopic, with­drew from the pro­ject on Mon­day af­ter the crick­eter warned he could face a back­lash from In­dia’s Tamil mi­nor­ity.</p>
    <p>Tamil politi­cians in In­dia ac­cuse Mu­ralitha­ran, who re­tired from Test cricket in 2010, of be­tray­ing fel­low Tamils in his coun­try dur­ing a civil war that ended in 2009.</p>
    <p>Vi­jay Sethu­pathi (above), 42, had been un­der pres­sure in his south­ern In­dian state of Tamil Nadu to drop the role in 800 – named af­ter the world record num­ber of Test wick­ets Mu­ralitha­ran took in his cel­e­brated ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want one of the finest ac­tors in Tamil Nadu to face any kind of trou­ble, hence I re­quest him to drop out of the pro­ject,” Mu­ralitha­ran, 48, wrote in a let­ter tweeted by the ac­tor.</p>
    <p>“There should be no ob­sta­cles for Sethu­pathi in the fu­ture be­cause of this movie.”</p>
    <p>Sethu­pathi wrote along­side the im­age of the let­ter: “Thank you and good­bye.”</p>
    <p>In­dia’s small MDMK party, which op­poses the Sin­halese-led gov­ern­ment in Sri Lanka, de­manded Sethu­pathi re­ject the role, say­ing Mu­ralitha­ran sided with Prime Min­is­ter Mahinda Ra­japaksa, who as pres­i­dent de­feated the sep­a­ratist Tamil Tiger in­sur­gency.</p>
    <p>The en­mity dates back to 2013, when Mu­ralitha­ran told then Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter David Cameron that he may have been “mis­led” by Tamil women who com­plained to him about dis­ap­pear­ances dur­ing the war.</p>
    <p>Mu­ralitha­ran, who is cur­rently work­ing as a bowl­ing coach with In­dian Premier League side Sun­ris­ers Hy­der­abad for the on­go­ing tour­na­ment in the United Arab Emi­rates, had said that his re­marks about Sri Lanka’s eth­nic war were “mis­un­der­stood”.</p>
    <p>Fans had slammed the ac­tor on so­cial me­dia, us­ing the hash­tag #shame­onVi­jaySethu­pathi.</p>
    <p>Mu­ralitha­ran added in the let­ter that he hoped a new lead would be an­nounced soon.</p>
    <p>“I ac­cepted this biopic be­cause I thought the movie will in­spire and pro­vide con­fi­dence to as­pir­ing young crick­eters,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>A source close to Mu­ralitha­ran said in Colombo: “The movie pro­ject will go on with­out Vi­jay. Pro­duc­ers are al­ready dis­cussing ways to pro­ceed.”</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions and in­ter­na­tional rights groups have ac­cused Sri Lankan forces of killing at least 40,000 mi­nor­ity Tamils in the fi­nal cam­paign against the Tigers. The gov­ern­ment has de­nied that it killed civil­ians.</p>
