    <p>Malaysia’s can­cel­la­tion of the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High­Speed Rail (HSR) project is the lat­est in a se­ries of con­tro­ver­sies in­volv­ing train projects that has cast a light on the gov­er­nance of these bil­lion-dol­lar deals.</p>
    <p>Since the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment came to power 10 months ago, at least two other tracks which tra­verse Kuala Lumpur’s greater metropoli­tan area have faced gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion over the se­lec­tion of con­trac­tors. The RM4.4 bil­lion (S$1.45 bil­lion) Klang Val­ley Dou­ble Track­ing Phase 2 (KVDT2) deal was ter­mi­nated abruptly last Au­gust af­ter Trans­port Min­is­ter Wee Ka Siong said the award should be re­tendered, lead­ing to a civil suit by the ap­pointed firm, Dhaya Maju LTAT.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Umno MP Ta­jud­din Ab­dul Rah­man’s chair­man­ship of Prasarana has also in­vited scru­tiny, es­pe­cially af­ter the na­tional pub­lic trans­port firm’s de­ci­sion to with­hold up to RM1 bil­lion owed to a con­sor­tium tasked with build­ing the Light Rail Tran­sit 3 (LRT3).</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ta­jud­din, the elec­tion direc­tor of Malaysia’s largest po­lit­i­cal party, cited Prasarana’s liq­uid­ity prob­lems and the lack of bu­mi­put­era sub­con­trac­tors se­lected by turnkey de­vel­oper MRCB-Ge­orge Kent (MRCBGK) for with­hold­ing the sum in t he RM17 bil­lion project.</p>
    <p>These gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tions have led to calls from across the po­lit­i­cal di­vide as well as civil so­ci­ety for more trans­parency, with some im­ply­ing crony­ism was at play.</p>
    <p>Former fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng has called f or the Malaysian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion to act “pro­fes­sion­ally and in­de­pen­dently by in­ves­ti­gat­ing the can­cel­la­tion of the KL-Sin­ga­pore HSR due to the Malaysian gov­ern­ment’s re­fusal to abide by the in­ter­na­tional ten­der process”.</p>
    <p>The sec­re­tary-gen­eral of op­po­si­tion Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party noted that the anti-graft agency had also opened a probe i nto Prasarana fol­low­ing rev­e­la­tions that it could pay out RM80 mil­lion in com­pen­sa­tion to a de­vel­oper partly owned by Mr Ta­jud­din’s fam­ily, and the RM1 bil­lion owed in the LRT3 con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources told The Straits Times that Mr Ta­jud­din’s as­ser­tion that Prasarana did not have the cash to pay MRCBGK was puz­zling, as the Fi­nance Min­istry in­jects an an­nual grant of more than RM2 bil­lion into the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The Pasir Salak MP had in­sisted the firm was left with RM844 mil­lion af­ter al­lo­cat­ing RM600 mil­lion to ser­vice loans and cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture of RM350 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“The amount out­stand­ing to MRCBGK is since July, so Prasarana could have asked for more funds. The gov­ern­ment has never re­jected re­quests for an in­jec­tion in the past be­cause it has to keep pub­lic trans­port run­ning,” said a se­nior ex­ec­u­tive on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>MRCBGK also dis­puted Mr Ta­jud­din’s claim that the firm has not met a bu­mi­put­era quota for LRT3 sub­con­trac­tors, say­ing the 40 per cent of ven­dors se­lected from the com­mu­nity – made up of the po­lit­i­cally cru­cial Malay ma­jor­ity and other na­tive mi­nori­ties – ex­ceeded the 30 per cent min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the gov­ern­ment has had to set­tle out of court with Dhaya Maju LTAT af­ter can­celling their KVDT2 agree­ment, cit­ing how the deal was di­rectly ne­go­ti­ated in 2019 by the Pakatan Hara­pan ad­min­is­tra­tion. The firm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Razeek Hus­sain Maricar had claimed in an af­fi­davit that Trans­port Min­is­ter Wee asked it to sub­con­tract the en­tire project to a “China com­pany”.</p>
    <p>In an es­say last week­end, Malaysia and Asean’s former en­vi­ron­ment depart­ment chief Ra­man Letchu­manan de­cried the “string of projects that were ter­mi­nated, re­designed and re­tendered” as “klepto-eco­nomics”.</p>
