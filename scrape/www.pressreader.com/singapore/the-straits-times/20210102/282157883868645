    <p>The elec­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den as US pres­i­dent will not end the US-China trade war. Mr Bi­den has al­ready vowed to keep out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s tar­iffs as lever­age for ne­go­ti­a­tions. That sig­nals the dawn of a per­ma­nent new era of eco­nomic com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the two su­per­pow­ers.</p>
    <p>But be­yond the flashy, head­line-grab­bing is­sue of tar­iffs and trade deals, there’s another, more im­por­tant eco­nomic strug­gle be­ing waged – the bat­tle to con­trol tech­nol­ogy in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>And the United States is de­ploy­ing some very risky weapons to win it.</p>
    <p>As China ap­proaches tech­no­log­i­cal par­ity with the US in a va­ri­ety of high-value in­dus­tries, the US has acted to main­tain supremacy.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Trump, the</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tee on For­eign In­vest­ment in the US (CFIUS) dra­mat­i­cally stepped up its block­age of Chi­nese ac­qui­si­tions of US com­pa­nies – a ma­jor way that China ap­pro­pri­ates ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Though nat­u­ral se­cu­rity is the of­fi­cial jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for this, re­tain­ing US com­mer­cial dom­i­nance is un­doubt­edly an ad­di­tional goal.</p>
    <p>CFIUS’ tougher ap­proach will likely con­tinue un­der Mr Bi­den. This is prob­a­bly a smart move, as Chi­nese ac­quir­ers have lit­tle to of­fer the US tech in­dus­try ex­cept cap­i­tal, and it’s al­ready awash in that, thanks to low interest rates and con­tin­ued in­flows of for­eign and do­mes­tic money.</p>
    <p>But what’s less ob­vi­ously smart is Mr Trump’s other big weapon against the Chi­nese tech in­dus­try: ex­port con­trols.</p>
    <p>Ex­port con­trols pre­vent US com­pa­nies from sell­ing tech­nol­ogy to Chi­nese com­pa­nies. Al­though China is get­ting more ad­vanced, its flag­ship com­pa­nies still de­pend on var­i­ous spe­cialised hard­ware and soft­ware prod­ucts that are pro­duced by only one or two highly spe­cialised com­pa­nies in the US or other de­vel­oped na­tions – for ex­am­ple, equip­ment used to make semi­con­duc­tors.</p>
    <p>Block­ing the flow of these prod­ucts can se­verely ham­per a Chi­nese com­pany’s busi­ness.</p>
    <p>This weapon was first wielded against Huawei Tech­nolo­gies, China’s premier tele­coms equip­ment maker and the lead­ing con­tender in the race to sup­ply 5G tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>For a while it looked as if Mr Trump had re­lented, but last au­tumn he cracked down even harder. The con­trols have suc­ceeded in hurt­ing Huawei’s busi­ness sub­stan­tially, at least in the short term. That has ap­par­ently en­cour­aged Mr Trump to dou­ble down on the tac­tic.</p>
    <p>His ad­min­is­tra­tion re­cently ex­tended ex­port con­trols to more than 60 Chi­nese com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing flag­ship chip­maker Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Corp and world-beat­ing drone maker DJI.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial jus­ti­fi­ca­tion is these com­pa­nies’ in­volve­ment with the Chi­nese mil­i­tary. But the lat­est round of con­trols also seemed aimed at pre­vent­ing China from gain­ing dom­i­nance in any high-value, high-tech in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>This is a very dan­ger­ous game. Stop­ping trade se­crets from leak­ing from the US to China is one thing. But try­ing to smash the Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try is a far taller or­der, and it seems un­likely to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>Economies spe­cialise when they trade with one another. The US is great at soft­ware, Ja­pan at car man­u­fac­tur­ing, Tai­wan at mak­ing semi­con­duc­tors, and so on.</p>
    <p>For China to be in­te­grated with the world econ­omy while not spe­cial­is­ing in any in­ter­na­tion­ally com­pet­i­tive high-tech prod­ucts at all would be ex­tremely strange. China is no longer the low-cost assem­bly plat­form it was in the 2000s, slap­ping to­gether iPhones with com­po­nents made in South Korea and Ja­pan; its tech tal­ent and ac­cu­mu­lated knowl­edge are now world-class.</p>
    <p>Some­one, some­where, will want to buy Chi­nese tech prod­ucts, and the US won’t be able to stop them. And in the mean­time, ex­port con­trols are hurt­ing US firms.</p>
    <p>If China can’t buy high-tech equip­ment, semi­con­duc­tors and soft­ware from the US, then it will go buy them from Ja­pan or Europe or else­where. Or if the US man­ages to block that too, then China will sim­ply learn how to make the prod­ucts it­self.</p>
    <p>The main en­dur­ing re­sult will be a loss of rev­enue for Amer­i­can man­u­fac­tur­ers, which will now be per­ma­nently shut out of the Chi­nese mar­ket. Thus ex­port con­trols could eas­ily end up hurt­ing the US more than China.</p>
    <p>The Peter­son In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Eco­nomics (PIIE) re­ports that as of last July, China ac­counted for a quar­ter of US semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ers’ rev­enues, but China got only 5 per cent of its semi­con­duc­tors from the US. So Amer­i­can sup­pli­ers can be re­placed more eas­ily than the Chi­nese mar­ket can.</p>
    <p>The PIIE re­port also notes that US equip­ment mak­ers will lose busi­ness else­where too, be­cause other coun­tries are afraid the US will try to stop them from sell­ing prod­ucts to China made with Amer­i­can equip­ment. And ex­port con­trols de­ter for­eign man­u­fac­tur­ers from in­vest­ing in the US, as then they might not be able to sell to China.</p>
    <p>In other words, ex­port con­trols are an at­tempt to force the global tech in­dus­try to di­vide neatly into two spheres – one Chi­nese and one Amer­i­can. But be­cause the</p>
    <p>Chi­nese mar­ket is so huge, Amer­ica could eas­ily find its own sphere far smaller and more piti­ful than the Chi­nese one.</p>
    <p>By seal­ing it­self be­hind an eco­nomic Iron Cur­tain, the US risks re­peat­ing the mis­takes made by its van­quished Cold War ri­val, the Soviet Union. Ex­port con­trols are sim­ply too dan­ger­ous a tool for eco­nomic com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>There are other ways to limit the reach of Chi­nese mil­i­tary tech­nol­ogy, such as the in­creas­ingly suc­cess­ful ef­fort to nudge the world away from Huawei’s 5G tech. The US should stick to tools like that, while up­grad­ing its own tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try and spend­ing more on re­search.</p>
