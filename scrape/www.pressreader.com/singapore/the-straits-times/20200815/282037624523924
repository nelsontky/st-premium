    <p>The Straits Times has won two top awards for out­stand­ing work chron­i­cling Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The Stories of A Pan­demic (Soap) Awards, or­gan­ised for the first time by phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion The Ma­ju­rity Trust, recog­nises con­tri­bu­tions by writ­ers, pho­tog­ra­phers and artists on the pan­demic here.</p>
    <p>The Ma­ju­rity Trust, which works with donors and char­i­ties to­wards build­ing and sus­tain­ing com­mu­nity spirit in Sin­ga­pore, an­nounced the awards yes­ter­day at a vir­tual Zoom we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>The awards spanned three cat­e­gories – Best Story, Best Commentary and Best Vis­ual – and en­tries were pub­lished be­tween Fe­bru­ary and May this year. The judges com­prised vet­eran jour­nal­ists and ed­i­tors in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Five jour­nal­ists from The Straits Times news­room were among 44 re­cip­i­ents of the awards, pick­ing up two wins and three merit prizes.</p>
    <p>Mr Han Fook Kwang, ST ed­i­torat-large and chair­man of the Soap Awards judg­ing panel, said he was pleased that the win­ning en­tries came from a wide range of pub­li­ca­tions – from main­stream me­dia, non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions, academia and in­di­vid­u­als writ­ing on their per­sonal blogs and so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“This is an anx­ious, un­cer­tain time for all of us, but when you read about how oth­ers are cop­ing or learn some­thing you did not know about the cri­sis, it deep­ens our un­der­stand­ing of what is hap­pen­ing, and that is what we are try­ing to achieve with these awards,” he said.</p>
    <p>ST senior cor­re­spon­dent Joyce Lim bagged the Best Story award for the month of April for her re­port on liv­ing con­di­tions of mi­grant work­ers con­fined to a dor­mi­tory due to a clus­ter of in­fec­tions, while sci­ence and en­vi­ron­ment cor­re­spon­dent Au­drey Tan re­ceived the merit prize in the same cat­e­gory for Fe­bru­ary for her re­port on the work of in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive pho­to­jour­nal­ist Kevin Lim won Best Vis­ual in the month of May for his pho­to­graphs of mi­grant work­ers un­der­go­ing swab tests, while senior ex­ec­u­tive pho­to­jour­nal­ist Neo Xiaobin was given a merit prize for the same month for her story shar­ing her own ex­pe­ri­ence and that of health­care work­ers on the front line.</p>
    <p>Senior education cor­re­spon­dent San­dra Davie re­ceived the merit prize in the Best Commentary cat­e­gory for May for her piece on the in­equal­i­ties af­fect­ing chil­dren in home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Other award re­cip­i­ents in­cluded Mr Yusuf Ab­dol Hamid from Vamos Pho­tog­ra­phy and Mr Yeo Boon Ping from Rice Me­dia, both of whom bagged the Best Story Award for the month of May. Their piece re­counted Mr Yusuf’s ex­pe­ri­ence as a food de­liv­ery rider amid the pan­demic. Artist Josef Lee from Mojo Stu­dio bagged the Best Vis­ual award for the month of Fe­bru­ary for his art­work which salutes front­line work­ers.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment of the award re­cip­i­ents was pre­ceded by a panel dis­cus­sion mod­er­ated by Mr Han where five pan­el­lists dis­cussed the so­ciopo­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic brunt of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>One of the pan­el­lists, Banyan Tree’s ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Ho Kwon Ping, shared his per­spec­tive on dilem­mas like the hous­ing of for­eign work­ers. “If the Gov­ern­ment tried to han­dle the prob­lem prop­erly, tried to build de­cent flats for them (mi­grant work­ers) in the mid­dle of an HDB es­tate, ev­ery­body would vote against them. I think it is a whole-of-so­ci­ety prob­lem and it’s too easy to just say, ‘Is the 4G lead­er­ship up to it?’”</p>
    <p>He added: “The ques­tion we should ask our­selves is: Are we, as a Sin­ga­porean so­ci­ety, will­ing to make the trade-offs that are nec­es­sary if we re­ally want to be a first­world so­ci­ety?”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Bap­tist Univer­sity’s pro­fes­sor of me­dia stud­ies Che­rian Ge­orge con­cluded the panel dis­cus­sion by rais­ing the im­por­tance of open and ro­bust com­pe­ti­tion to­wards bet­ter­ment in pol­i­tics and gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>The awards are set to con­tinue on a monthly ba­sis for a year, with win­ners re­ceiv­ing $500 in prize money, a Soap me­mento and a win­ner’s cer­tifi­cate. Two merit award cer­tifi­cates will also be pre­sented in each cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The Soap Awards bills it­self as the first of its kind in Sin­ga­pore, cast­ing a wide net that cuts across var­i­ous print, vis­ual and dig­i­tal me­dia per­tain­ing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Nom­i­nated work must have been pub­lished on any me­dia plat­form ac­ces­si­ble to the pub­lic. Blog en­tries and Face­book posts of at least 300 words are el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>FOS­TER­ING DEEPER UN­DER­STAND­ING</p>
    <p>This is an anx­ious, un­cer­tain time for all of us, but when you read about how oth­ers are cop­ing or learn some­thing you did not know about the cri­sis, it deep­ens our un­der­stand­ing of what is hap­pen­ing, and that is what we are try­ing to ’’ achieve with these awards. MR HAN FOOK KWANG, The Straits Times’ ed­i­tor-at-large and chair­man of the Soap Awards judg­ing panel.</p>
