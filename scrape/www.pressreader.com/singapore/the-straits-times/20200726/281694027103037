    <p>Hu­man tri­als for a Covid-19 vac­cine could be­gin in Sin­ga­pore as early as this week.</p>
    <p>The trial will in­volve 108 healthy vol­un­teers of var­i­ous ages in Sin­ga­pore who will be in­jected with the vac­cine de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Called Lu­nar-Cov19, the vac­cine is one of 25 vac­cine can­di­dates world­wide that ei­ther have been tested on hu­mans, or have re­ceived ap­proval to do so. Some 141 oth­ers are still at a pre-clin­i­cal phase.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, told The Sun­day Times that the aim of the trial is to de­ter­mine the safety of the vac­cine, and whether it could coax the de­sired im­mune re­sponse in the body against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Blood sam­ples will be taken from the vol­un­teers sev­eral times af­ter vac­ci­na­tion for anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>As im­mune sys­tem el­e­ments such as an­ti­bod­ies and T-cells are found in blood, the data will help sci­en­tists de­ter­mine if the vac­cine is suc­cess­ful in stim­u­lat­ing the body to pro­duce the “sol­diers” crit­i­cal for help­ing the body fight off an in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­cently pub­lished re­sults from hu­man tri­als for other vac­cine can­di­dates have al­ready shown en­cour­ag­ing signs on these fronts.</p>
    <p>The find­ings re­leased pub­licly last Mon­day were from the early phases of clin­i­cal tri­als for vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and multi­na­tional drug­maker As­traZeneca; CanSino Bi­o­log­ics and China’s mil­i­tary re­search unit; and Ger­man biotech com­pany BioN­Tech and US drug­maker Pfizer.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said he was op­ti­mistic that the re­sults from the Sin­ga­pore trial would yield sim­i­larly en­cour­ag­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary stud­ies on an­i­mal mod­els had al­ready shown that the Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine was safe and did not have any side ef­fects, he said.</p>
    <p>This data had al­lowed the vac­cine to re­ceive ap­proval for clin­i­cal tri­als ahead of the ex­pected Septem­ber time­line, mak­ing it the first in-hu­man clin­i­cal trial in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“When news got out that we were do­ing a vac­cine, we were thrilled that many mem­bers of the pub­lic said they wanted to vol­un­teer for it,” Prof Ooi said. “And I think that’s en­cour­ag­ing, be­cause the faster the vol­un­teers come for­ward, the faster we can com­plete the trial.”</p>
    <p>The clin­i­cal trial will be con­ducted at the SingHealth In­ves­ti­ga­tional Medicine Unit, lo­cated in the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said that vol­un­teers of all ages are needed.</p>
    <p>Those in­ter­ested should con­tact the SingHealth In­ves­ti­ga­tional Medicine Unit by e-mail at imu@singhealth.com.sg or call 6323-7544/8318-0685.</p>
    <p>He said that if things go ac­cord­ing to plan, re­sults from the trial – known in med­i­cal cir­cles as a Phase I/II trial – could be avail­able by around Oc­to­ber or Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The next phase of the clin­i­cal de­vel­op­ment process in­volves in­oc­u­lat­ing a much larger pool of thou­sands of vol­un­teers in Sin­ga­pore and abroad, said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>This could start be­fore the end of the year, he said, adding: “In Phase III, we want to know whether the vac­cine ac­tu­ally pre­vents them from get­ting Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>A vac­cine works by “show­ing” the im­mune sys­tem an im­por­tant part of the virus and “train­ing” it to recog­nise and re­mem­ber a pathogen with­out ex­pos­ing the pa­tient to the risk of dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional vac­cines do this by in­ject­ing a killed or weak­ened form of the virus into the hu­man body, so the im­mune sys­tem recog­nises the in­vader, and be­gins sum­mon­ing its “sol­diers” – an­ti­bod­ies and T-cells – to get rid of it.</p>
    <p>But the Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine in­volves a newer type of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to a front run­ner vac­cine</p>
    <p>When news got out that we were do­ing a vac­cine, we were thrilled that many mem­bers of the pub­lic said they wanted to vol­un­teer for it... And I think that’s en­cour­ag­ing, be­cause the faster the vol­un­teers come for­ward, the faster we can com­plete the trial.</p>
    <p>VOL­UN­TEERS APLENTY</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR OOI ENG EONG, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>can­di­date be­ing de­vel­oped by Amer­i­can firm Moderna, the vac­cine con­tains only frag­ments of the virus’ ge­netic ma­te­rial, in­stead of the whole virus.</p>
    <p>When these vi­ral ge­netic frag­ments en­ter the hu­man cell af­ter in­jec­tion, the genome frag­ments com­man­deer the cell to be­gin pro­duc­ing the sig­na­ture spike pro­tein of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This trains the body to recog­nise a key part of the virus – the spike pro­tein – with­out ex­pos­ing it to the whole virus.</p>
    <p>But while the Moderna vac­cine is a non-repli­cat­ing vac­cine, which means it does not enable the spike pro­tein to repli­cate in the body, Lu­nar-Cov19 can.</p>
    <p>This repli­ca­tion sim­u­lates an ac­tual vi­ral in­fec­tion, said Prof Ooi.</p>
    <p>A non-repli­cat­ing vac­cine, on the other hand, merely pro­vides the body with a mugshot of the in­vader.</p>
    <p>“By mim­ick­ing the repli­ca­tion, the body sees a ‘video’ of an in­va­sion, rather than just a snap­shot.</p>
    <p>“This al­lows the in­fec­tion to play out for the im­mune sys­tem, and we can see how best to tar­get the virus,” he said.</p>
