    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore suf­fered its worst quar­ter since its in­te­grated re­sort (IR) opened in 2010, as pandemic-in­duced dis­rup­tions to the global travel and tourism in­dus­try, cou­pled with a shut­down of nearly three months, dragged the Sin­ga­pore-listed casino op­er­a­tor into the red in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>It closed the quar­ter with a net loss of $163.3 mil­lion – the worst quarterly per­for­mance since Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) opened.</p>
    <p>This was a sharp re­ver­sal from the net profit of $168.4 mil­lion in the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>“With tourism be­ing the main driver of the group’s busi­ness, our op­er­a­tions and fi­nan­cial per­for­mance have been se­verely im­pacted. At the on­set of the pandemic, vis­i­tor ar­rivals dropped very sig­nif­i­cantly from Fe­bru­ary,” Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore said in its quarterly busi­ness re­view re­leased af­ter mar­ket close yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ow­ing to the cir­cuit breaker, RWS sus­pended all of­fer­ings, in­clud­ing Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore, SEA Aquar­ium, Ad­ven­ture Cove Water­park and Dol­phin Is­land, ho­tels and the casino, from April 6 to June 30.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the swift im­ple­men­ta­tion of a se­ries of cost-con­tain­ment mea­sures in­clud­ing pay­roll ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion and other pro­duc­tiv­ity ini­tia­tives, the im­pact of suf­fer­ing al­most zero rev­enue dur­ing the tem­po­rary clo­sure pe­riod in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2020 was dev­as­tat­ing,” the group said.</p>
    <p>“For the rest of the year, the group re­mains pes­simistic on the over­all fi­nan­cial per­for­mance as global travel re­mains highly re­stric­tive,” it added.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the “painful but nec­es­sary de­ci­sion” to re­trench part of its work­force last month, Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore said: “The medium-term out­look for the en­tire travel en­vi­ron­ment re­mains sig­nif­i­cantly chal­lenged. Air travel in Asia is only ex­pected to reach 50 per cent of preCovid-19 lev­els by June 2021.”</p>
    <p>RWS’ rev­enue for the three months to June 30 plunged 94 per cent to $41.3 mil­lion from $636.8 mil­lion a year ago, as the fallout from the pandemic dev­as­tated both its gam­ing and non-gam­ing rev­enues.</p>
    <p>The tem­po­rary clo­sure of its casino and at­trac­tions sent gam­ing rev­enues plung­ing 99 per cent to just $6.5 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter, from $441.1 mil­lion a year ago, while non-gam­ing rev­enues skid­ded 92 per cent to $16.3 mil­lion from $195 mil­lion a year ago. In­vest­ment, hos­pi­tal­ity and sup­port ser­vices, how­ever, rose to $18.5 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter from $604,000 a year ago.</p>
    <p>The group’s Ebitda – a mea­sure of profit be­fore tax, in­ter­est and other items – swung into the red, with net losses of $84.9 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter from a net profit of $294.4 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, ri­val Ma­rina Bay Sands skid­ded into the red in the sec­ond quar­ter on net losses of US$113 mil­lion (S$155 mil­lion), a sharp fall from the net profit of US$346 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue – from its casino, mall, con­ven­tion cen­tre, ho­tel rooms and food and bev­er­age – plum­meted 96.7 per cent on the year to just US$23 mil­lion for the quar­ter, from US$688 mil­lion in the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Of this, casino rev­enue sank to US$7 mil­lion from US$468 mil­lion pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore’s shares closed un­changed at 71 cents ahead of the re­lease of its re­sults yes­ter­day evening.</p>
