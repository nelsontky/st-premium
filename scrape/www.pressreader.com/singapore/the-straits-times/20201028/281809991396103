    <p>BANGKOK • Protests sweep­ing across Thai­land threaten to snuff out chances of a con­sump­tion-led re­cov­ery from the na­tion’s worst eco­nomic slump.</p>
    <p>Ms Nat­tanan­porn Ha­mali, a 29-year-old sales­woman at a car show­room in Bangkok, is al­ready feel­ing the pinch from con­sumers’ thrifty be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>With the bulk of her earn­ings com­ing from sales com­mis­sion, she is strug­gling to pay her mort­gage and util­ity bills.</p>
    <p>“I have some cus­tomers who pledge to buy and then de­lay their de­ci­sion, wait­ing to see the im­pact of protests on their jobs and the econ­omy,” said Ms Nat­tanan­porn, who is on her third job since the start of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Bank of Thai­land gover­nor Setha­put Suthi­wart-Narueput voiced his con­cerns last week about the protests hurt­ing con­fi­dence, con­sump­tion and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank has al­ready flagged that it may take at least two years for the econ­omy to re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha’s gov­ern­ment has un­veiled a raft of mea­sures to drive con­sumer spend­ing af­ter trade and tourism ground to a halt dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tain out­look for the econ­omy, which con­tracted a record 12.2 per cent in the third quar­ter, has weighed on the na­tion’s stocks and cur­rency.</p>
    <p>Un­like dur­ing pre­vi­ous episodes of po­lit­i­cal tur­bu­lence, when the econ­omy es­caped ma­jor hits thanks to ro­bust ex­ter­nal de­mand, weak global growth now means sup­port is lim­ited to gov­ern­ment mea­sures, which protests threaten to de­rail, ac­cord­ing to Dr Som­prawin Man­prasert, chief econ­o­mist at Bank of Ayud­hya.</p>
    <p>“Al­though the bot­tom might be be­hind us, it doesn’t mean that we’re on a path to re­cov­ery if the econ­omy lacks sup­port mea­sures (from the gov­ern­ment)”, said Dr Som­prawin.</p>
    <p>“The un­cer­tainty and gov­ern­ment in­sta­bil­ity could re­sult in the dis­con­ti­nu­ity of mea­sures, which will af­fect growth.”</p>
    <p>While the po­lit­i­cal un­rest has not de­railed any gov­ern­ment pro­grammes, in­vestors have dumped shares of shop­ping mall op­er­a­tors such as Cen­tral Pat­tana and As­set World Cor­po­ra­tion on con­cerns of weak sales.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers may also pre­fer to stay home as pro­test­ers threaten to con­tinue ral­ly­ing un­til their demands for Mr Prayut’s ouster, a new Con­sti­tu­tion and re­form of the monar­chy are met.</p>
    <p>That risks spoil­ing Fi­nance Min­is­ter Arkhom Termpit­taya­paisith’s bets of tax breaks and cash hand­outs for low-in­come groups to spur re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>While Thai­land was suc­cess­ful in con­tain­ing the pan­demic with a na­tional lock­down and bor­der clo­sures, the mea­sures ren­dered mil­lions job­less and left small and medium-sized busi­nesses strug­gling.</p>
    <p>One key to re­viv­ing the econ­omy will be how fast the na­tion can open up to tourists, who gen­er­ated about US$60 bil­lion (S$81.6 bil­lion) in rev­enue last year.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have made a start with lim­ited long-stay visa per­mits.</p>
    <p>“The wors­en­ing eco­nomic con­di­tions are con­tribut­ing to pub­lic dis­con­tent and in­deed the protests are likely to per­sist, mak­ing it even harder for the re­cov­ery from Covid-19 to take hold,” said Mr Euben Paraceulle­s, an econ­o­mist at No­mura Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>More than 62 per cent of par­tic­i­pants in a poll by Suan Dusit Univer­sity pub­lished on Sun­day said dis­con­tent with Mr Prayut was the key rea­son for the re­cent demon­stra­tions, with about 44 per cent say­ing they think the gov­ern­ment’s weak per­for­mance played a role in es­ca­lat­ing the protest move­ment.</p>
    <p>The stand-off may in­ten­sify if the gov­ern­ment and Par­lia­ment fail to come up with a sat­is­fac­tory re­sponse to the move­ment’s demands, said Mr Narong­dach Jun­tara­pais­arn, in­vest­ment strate­gist at Bangkok­based AIRA Se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>“Fresh protests will put more pres­sure on the Thai econ­omy, which is al­ready very frag­ile from the im­pact of the Covid-19 out­break,” he said.</p>
