    <p>The Oppo Reno4 Pro flat­ters to de­ceive. From its prod­uct im­ages, it looks like a flag­ship smart­phone, with a curved, near-bezel-less dis­play and quad rear cam­eras.</p>
    <p>But this il­lu­sion is bro­ken when I pick it up. The Reno4 Pro is too light, lack­ing the heft of a flag­ship phone. Also, de­spite the frosted glass fin­ish, it has a plas­tic chas­sis, not a glass-and-metal body.</p>
    <p>To be fair, the Reno4 Pro ($899) is not tar­geted at the premium seg­ment. And its weight (161g) grows on me, as it is eas­ier to hold than a glass-clad flag­ship model.</p>
    <p>It does have some fea­tures that may be deemed as high-end, in­clud­ing a 90Hz Amoled screen that is smooth, re­spon­sive and bright enough to use out­doors on a sunny day.</p>
    <p>The dis­play also makes an im­pres­sion while I play high dy­namic range (HDR) videos on YouTube, where the spec­u­lar high­lights are al­most sear­ingly bright. But to my dis­ap­point­ment, HDR is not sup­ported by the Reno4 Pro in Net­flix.</p>
    <p>The high­light, though, is its 65W fast-charg­ing fea­ture.</p>
    <p>Oppo says the phone’s 4,000mAh bat­tery can be charged from zero to 100 per cent in 36 min­utes, com­pared with one hour or so for other phones with fast charge.</p>
    <p>In my test, it takes 43 min­utes, which is close enough. This su­per­fast charg­ing fea­ture more than makes up for the Reno4 Pro’s lack of wire­less charg­ing.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is good too – the phone lasted 15 hours and 10 min­utes in the video-loop bat­tery test at max­i­mum screen bright­ness.</p>
    <p>Like most mid-range phones, the Reno4 Pro does not have IP cer­ti­fi­ca­tion for wa­ter- or dus­tre­sis­tance. On the plus side, the head­phone jack is present. It also has a sin­gle speaker at the bot­tom that is suf­fi­ciently loud, un­less it is cov­ered by your palm.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the rear cam­eras are at risk of be­ing ob­scured by a fin­ger or hand while hold­ing the phone, as the ver­ti­cally aligned cam­eras are too close to the edge.</p>
    <p>The main 48-megapixel (MP) cam­era per­forms like the ones found on many mid-tier smart­phones. It uses pixel-bin­ning to cre­ate good-look­ing 12MP pho­tos that ap­pear less noisy than the na­tive 48MP ver­sions.</p>
    <p>In bright day­light, pho­tos turn out sharp with ac­cu­rate colours. The white bal­ance is slightly off for in­door shots, but still ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>But users may be dis­ap­pointed by the lack of a tele­photo cam­era among the Reno4 Pro’s four cam­eras. In­stead, you will find an ul­tra­w­ide cam­era, which, de­spite be­ing of a lower qual­ity than the main cam­era, has its uses. I am not thrilled by the macro and the depth cam­eras, but they are the norm for mid-range mod­els.</p>
    <p>In low-light sit­u­a­tions, the Reno4 Pro’s night mode does a de­cent job at bright­en­ing up the scene. While the photo qual­ity is not great, es­pe­cially when zoomed in, the shots are prob­a­bly us­able for so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The cam­era app has sev­eral in­ter­est­ing modes that should ap­peal to the so­cial-me­dia crowd. For in­stance, the AI Color Por­trait mode ren­ders the back­ground of a por­trait photo in black and white while the sub­ject re­mains in colour. This fea­ture also works for videos.</p>
    <p>While the Reno4 Pro’s ColorOS in­ter­face mostly sticks to the stock ver­sion of the An­droid 10 op­er­at­ing sys­tem (OS) with­out heavy-handed cus­tomi­sa­tions, the phone has some pre­loaded Oppo-made apps, such as its own clock and cal­cu­la­tor apps, that add lit­tle value next to the de­fault ver­sions in the An­droid OS.</p>
    <p>The Reno4 Pro’s per­for­mance is ac­cept­able, though its mid-range Qual­comm Snap­dragon 720G is just a tad slow when load­ing and run­ning apps and games.</p>
    <p>De­spite its lower model name, the 720G is sim­i­lar in per­for­mance to the Snap­dragon 730G in my test. But the mid-tier Snap­dragon 765G chip is faster, of­fers 5G con­nec­tiv­ity and, more im­por­tantly, is found in the cheaper OnePlus Nord ($649).</p>
    <p>The Reno4 Pro is a de­cent midrange smart­phone with two stand­out fea­tures – a bright dis­play and su­per-fast charg­ing. But its over­all pack­age does not jus­tify its $899 price, when there are cheaper al­ter­na­tives in the market.</p>
