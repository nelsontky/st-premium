    <p>Mr Anil David did three stints in prison for fraud and crim­i­nal breach of trust.</p>
    <p>The last time he was sen­tenced, in 2004, he ended up spend­ing eight years be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>But he man­aged to find a new lease of life af­ter com­plet­ing his sen­tence, and now works to give other for­mer of­fend­ers a chance for a fresh start.</p>
    <p>The 52-year-old Sin­ga­porean runs so­cial en­ter­prise Agape Con­nect­ing Peo­ple, a con­tact cen­tre which em­ploys those who, like him, have paid their debt to so­ci­ety and are ea­ger to start con­tribut­ing anew.</p>
    <p>It was the chance to work in a call cen­tre dur­ing his third stint in jail that gave him the needed wake-up call.</p>
    <p>“I had never worked in a call cen­tre be­fore. When I went there, I was think­ing, who knows, maybe this is some­thing that can help me shape my fu­ture. If I suc­ceed, I could get a job when I am re­leased,” said Mr Anil.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of the call cen­tre also in­spired him to dream big, he said.</p>
    <p>“He told me this: ‘Dreams with goals are pos­si­ble. Dreams with­out goals are use­less’.”</p>
    <p>Mr Anil then took out his Bible and wrote down 42 dreams and goals in it. He still has the book to­day, at his of­fice in the con­tact cen­tre in Tai Seng.</p>
    <p>Thirty-eight of his listed dreams have come true, he said.</p>
    <p>One of them was to set up his own call cen­tre.</p>
    <p>About a year af­ter his re­lease, in 2012, Mr Anil started Agape with his wife.</p>
    <p>To­day, the con­tact cen­tre em­ploys nearly 150 staff, some of whom are still serv­ing out their sen­tences. Oth­ers are for­mer of­fend­ers and se­nior cit­i­zens. Yet oth­ers are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing var­i­ous chal­lenges in their lives.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Anil: “We have placed al­most 600 in­di­vid­u­als in our pro­gramme. Some have got­ten good jobs else­where, some have re­mar­ried, some have rein­te­grated back into so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>This year, the com­pany was given one of its big­gest projects – man­ning the Na­tional Care Hot­line, which was set up by the Gov­ern­ment to of­fer psy­cho­log­i­cal aid and emo­tional sup­port to those who needed it amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Staff from Agape have been the “first-level triage” for dis­tressed call­ers to the hot­line since it was rolled out in April.</p>
    <p>They help to calm call­ers down be­fore chan­nelling the calls to the hot­line’s trained pro­fes­sion­als, who in­clude psy­chol­o­gists, coun­sel­lors and so­cial work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Anil said the project was the break­through he had been pray­ing for, and it af­firmed his be­lief that work could be a plat­form for for­mer of­fend­ers and oth­ers to re­deem and prove them­selves.</p>
    <p>For his work with Agape and help­ing for­mer of­fend­ers, Mr Anil is one of those short­listed for this year’s The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year award.</p>
    <p>He said he is grate­ful to his wife San­gita Devi, 51, and two daugh­ters, now 18 and 25, who love him un­con­di­tion­ally and have stood by him over the years.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice to oth­ers: “We can­not undo a lot of wrongs that we’ve done. I’ve done so many wrongs.</p>
    <p>“If you have done some­thing that hurts some­one, be pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“Start seek­ing for­give­ness and rec­on­cil­i­a­tion. We don’t need to make en­e­mies in this world.”</p>
