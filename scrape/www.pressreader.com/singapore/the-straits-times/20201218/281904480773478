    <p>PARIS • A court in France has con­victed 14 peo­ple of crimes rang­ing from fi­nanc­ing ter­ror­ism to mem­ber­ship of a crim­i­nal gang in re­la­tion to Is­lamist at­tacks in the coun­try in 2015 against the Char­lie Hebdo satir­i­cal magazine and a Jewish su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The trial has re­opened one of mod­ern France’s dark­est episodes, just as an­other wave of Is­lamist at­tacks on home soil this au­tumn, in­clud­ing the be­head­ing of a school­teacher, prompted the gov­ern­ment to crack down on what it calls Is­lamist sep­a­ratism.</p>
    <p>Broth­ers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed Char­lie Hebdo’s of­fices in Paris on Jan 7, 2015, spray­ing gun­fire and killing 12, nearly a decade af­ter the weekly pub­lished car­toons mock­ing Prophet Muham­mad. A third at­tacker, Am­edy Coulibaly, killed a po­lice­woman and then four Jewish hostages in a su­per­mar­ket in a</p>
    <p>Paris sub­urb. Like the Kouachis, Coulibaly was killed in a shootout with po­lice.</p>
    <p>Among the 14 ac­com­plices sen­tenced on Wed­nes­day was Hayat Boumed­di­ene, the for­mer part­ner of Coulibaly and one of three de­fen­dants tried in ab­sen­tia. Be­lieved to be still alive and on the run from an in­ter­na­tional ar­rest war­rant, prose­cu­tors re­ferred to her as an “Is­lamic State princess”.</p>
    <p>The judges con­victed Boumed­di­ene, 32, of fi­nanc­ing ter­ror­ism and be­long­ing to a crim­i­nal ter­ror­ist net­work, and sen­tenced her to 30 years in jail.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks, claimed by AlQaeda and the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), laid bare France’s strug­gle to counter the threat of mil­i­tants brought up in the coun­try and of for­eign ter­ror­ists.</p>
    <p>“The fact of choos­ing vic­tims pre­cisely be­cause they were jour­nal­ists, or a mem­ber of the se­cu­rity forces, or of Jewish faith, clearly demon­strates in it­self their de­sire to sow ter­ror in West­ern coun­tries,” the pre­sid­ing judge said.</p>
    <p>Ter­ror­ism-re­lated charges were dropped for six of the de­fen­dants who were found guilty of lesser crimes.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ists from Char­lie Hebdo tes­ti­fied dur­ing the trial. Af­ter the rul­ing, the magazine’s lawyer, Mr Richard Malka, de­scribed the de­fen­dants as part of a neb­u­lous sup­port net­work that en­abled the at­tack­ers to spill blood. “With­out these neb­u­lous net­works, at­tacks can­not oc­cur,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>On the eve of the trial’s open­ing, Char­lie Hebdo, which has long tested the lim­its of what so­ci­ety will ac­cept in the name of free speech, reprinted the car­toons that had stirred out­rage in the Mus­lim world when they were first pub­lished by a Dan­ish pa­per in 2005.</p>
    <p>A month later, history teacher Sa­muel Paty was de­cap­i­tated by a teenage Is­lamist who said in a recorded mes­sage he was aveng­ing Mr Paty’s use of the car­toons in a class on civil lib­er­ties.</p>
