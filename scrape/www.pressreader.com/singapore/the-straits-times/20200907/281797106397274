    <p>Mr David Llorito, 56, a com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer at the World Bank, used to cover about 100km a day on his tour­ing bi­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>In one of his bike-pack­ing ad­ven­tures l ast year, he man­aged to pedal his way for about 300km across Panay is­land in the cen­tral Philip­pines be­fore a typhoon caught up with him.</p>
    <p>Then came the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>These days, he is down to bik­ing just 15km a day.</p>
    <p>“I use it for sup­ply runs. I use it to go to open mar­kets. I’m still wary of go­ing to the malls be­cause of news that the virus is in the air,” he said.</p>
    <p>But while his wings have been clipped, he is glad that he is now see­ing more fel­low cy­clists on the road.</p>
    <p>With pub­lic trans­port still scarce be­cause of shel­ter-at-home re­stric­tions to slow the spread of Covid-19, hun­dreds of thou­sands of Filipinos are turn­ing to bi­cy­cles to take them where they need to go.</p>
    <p>Bi­cy­cles are sell­ing like hot cakes, with racks at even high-end bike shops empty.</p>
    <p>A small shop in Manila’s La Loma dis­trict has had to re­plen­ish its stock ev­ery week be­cause bi­cy­cles were be­ing snapped up as soon as they ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“We’re sell­ing seven to 10 bi­cy­cles a week, far more than what we used to,” said Ms Princess Dianne Barino, 21, a clerk at the shop.</p>
    <p>En­try-level bikes that sell for 5,000 pe­sos to 7,000 pe­sos (S$140 to S$200) are the most pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>It is not just bi­cy­cles that are in hot de­mand.</p>
    <p>“We sell about 100 hel­mets a week,” said Ms Barino.</p>
    <p>Mr Llorito said he once went to four bike shops look­ing for a brake set and a seat post.</p>
    <p>“You could eas­ily get these parts be­fore the pan­demic. Now, you have to put your name on a list and wait,” he said.</p>
    <p>Three out of ev­ery four peo­ple in Manila can­not af­ford a car or mo­tor­cy­cle. And with very lim­ited bus and train ser­vices, the only op­tion for many to get to work or a gro­cery store is ei­ther by walk­ing or ped­alling.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, the bi­cy­cle is the more de­sir­able of the two.</p>
    <p>A study by the e-com­merce ag­gre­ga­tor iPrice Group has found that Filipinos were three times more likely to search on­line for bi­cy­cles to buy in June as they did in April.</p>
    <p>Even elec­tric bikes and scoot­ers are be­ing snapped up. Google searches for e-bikes and e-scoot­ers grew by up to 189 per cent, ac­cord­ing to iPrice.</p>
    <p>Mr Llorito is hop­ing this new­found en­thu­si­asm among Filipinos for the bi­cy­cle will not wane af­ter the Covid-19 out­break is over.</p>
    <p>He said the pan­demic had spurred the gov­ern­ment into build­ing in­fra­struc­ture to sup­port cycling as a way of life.</p>
    <p>Traf­fic of­fi­cials are cre­at­ing bike lanes along roads and high­ways, and malls are fi­nally al­lo­cat­ing park­ing space for bi­cy­cles.</p>
    <p>“That’s one pull fac­tor. Hope­fully, the en­thu­si­asm among lo­cal gov­ern­ment units will con­tinue,” said Mr Llorito.</p>
    <p>He also be­lieves that those who have gone into bik­ing as part of their daily rou­tine will even­tu­ally make it a way of life, even when it is al­ready deemed safe to once again ride a train or a bus.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ways this sim­ple joy of us­ing your own leg power to move around. It gives you a sense of free­dom. It gives you a sense that ev­ery ride is a ful­fill­ing ex­pe­ri­ence,” he said.</p>
