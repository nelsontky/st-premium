    <p>The Hong Kong govern­ment rolled out free univer­sal test­ing for Covid-19 yes­ter­day, but some have called for a boy­cott of the vol­un­tary mass ex­er­cise. Over 650,000 peo­ple – about 9 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion – had signed up to get tested as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong govern­ment rolled out its free univer­sal test­ing for Covid-19 yes­ter­day, but some have called for a boy­cott of the vol­un­tary mass ex­er­cise to try and iden­tify those in­fected.</p>
    <p>Over 650,000 peo­ple – about 9 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion or fewer than one in 10 peo­ple – signed up to get them­selves tested as of yes­ter­day, Sec­re­tary for Civil Ser­vice Pa­trick Nip said.</p>
    <p>Some 82,000 peo­ple went through the test, of which 8,000 were walk-ins.</p>
    <p>Of the 141 cen­tres across the city, 97 cen­tres were fully booked on Day 1 of the ex­er­cise, while 32 were fully booked for the week.</p>
    <p>Mr Nip said ad­di­tional ap­point­ment slots would be added at the fully-booked cen­tres from to­mor­row and the pub­lic can reg­is­ter from to­day.</p>
    <p>Also at the brief­ing was Health and Food Sec­re­tary Sophia Chan, who stressed that this was a crit­i­cal anti-epi­demic mea­sure. She noted that 2,000 med­i­cal staff are help­ing to take sam­ples and 2,400 have been de­ployed to sup­port the team.</p>
    <p>On whether the sign-up rate is far short of the govern­ment’s ex­pec­ta­tions, Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said “the univer­sal com­mu­nity test­ing pro­gramme is a ser­vice meant for those who want to do it” and there is no par­tic­u­lar tar­get rate the govern­ment wants to achieve. “There’s also a ser­vice to en­able us to iden­tify the re­main­ing in­fected cases in the com­mu­nity so that we could re­turn to nor­mal as soon as pos­si­ble,” she added, re­fer­ring to the ex­ist­ing pro­gramme to test those deemed as high-risk, in­clud­ing driv­ers and the el­derly.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said about a quar­ter of the con­firmed Covid-19 cases are with­out symp­toms and “that is a very wor­ry­ing trend”.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s daily con­firmed cases have fallen steadily from the highs of over 100 a month ago af­ter the govern­ment ex­panded so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures dras­ti­cally, in­clud­ing ban­ning din­ing-in ser­vices for din­ner and mak­ing it manda­tory to wear a mask out­doors even while ex­er­cis­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the health au­thor­i­ties said the city added 12 new con­firmed in­fec­tions, bring­ing the tally to 4,822, in­clud­ing 90 deaths.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Ed­u­ca­tion Kevin Ye­ung also an­nounced that classes in schools will re­sume in two phases later this month.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, queues were spot­ted at some test­ing venues ear­lier in the day but other venues, such as Tse­ung Kwan O Sports Cen­tre, were largely empty.</p>
    <p>Ms San­dra Han, 26, said there were more staff at the cen­tre than peo­ple tak­ing the tests. “I thought there might be a lot of peo­ple and I was wor­ried about be­ing in­fected there, but the wait­ing area, sam­pling area and reg­is­tra­tion area are far apart. Be­sides, the sam­pling is very fast, less than five min­utes from en­ter­ing to ex­it­ing.”</p>
    <p>The mass test­ing is be­ing car­ried out with the help of a team from main­land China. Some pan­democrats and ac­tivists, in­clud­ing a hospi­tal work­ers’ union – the Hospi­tal Author­ity Em­ploy­ees Al­liance – are call­ing for a boy­cott.</p>
    <p>They said hav­ing large groups of peo­ple in the cen­tres could lead to more in­fec­tion clus­ters and the pro­gramme would not sig­nif­i­cantly ease the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion. It could in­stead give peo­ple a false sense of se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment had ear­lier dis­missed ru­mours that the DNA of those tested would be col­lected by the main­land team and sent to the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said yes­ter­day– ahead of the weekly Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil meet­ing – that the pur­pose of the ex­er­cise has noth­ing to do with gain­ing the govern­ment pop­u­lar­ity but is part of ef­forts against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She added that there is a group that is try­ing “to cause wor­ries and fears among the peo­ple”.</p>
