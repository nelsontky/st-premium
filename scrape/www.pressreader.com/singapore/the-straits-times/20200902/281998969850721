    <p>At 40m, Jewel Changi Air­port’s wa­ter­fall, the world’s tallest in­door one, makes such a splash that peo­ple stand­ing nearby of­ten get a lit­tle wet.</p>
    <p>The wa­ter never stops, so there are al­ways pud­dles on the floor to mop up, for the safety of vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Clean­ers pre­vi­ously had to spend 10 min­utes each time do­ing this man­u­ally at one- to two-hour in­ter­vals. But since Jan­uary, the oner­ous task has been taken over by two tire­less work­ers.</p>
    <p>They are Jewel’s LeoScrub ro­bots, built by lo­cal com­pany Lion­sBot In­ter­na­tional and part of a grow­ing fleet of au­toma­tons help­ing to keep Changi Air­port hum­ming along daily.</p>
    <p>Clean­ing ro­bots like the LeoScrubs make up the bulk of the 47 ro­bots in Jewel and the air­port’s ter­mi­nals. But these ro­bots are also in­creas­ingly be­ing called upon to in­ter­act with vis­i­tors in a va­ri­ety of ways.</p>
    <p>The LeoScrubs, for ex­am­ple, sport a QR code on their frames that vis­i­tors can scan with their phones to open a menu with ques­tions they can ask the ro­bots.</p>
    <p>These in­clude, if vis­i­tors are so in­clined, ask­ing the ro­bots to sing.</p>
    <p>Jewel is also tri­alling a concierge robot that pro­vides di­rec­tions to shops within the mall and dou­bles as a tick­et­ing kiosk for tourist at­trac­tions, among other ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The concierge ro­bots will be de­ployed later this year.</p>
    <p>“The use of ro­bots has helped to ease the more la­bo­ri­ous tasks of our staff, as well as those of our part­ners, at Jewel,” said Jewel Changi Air­port head of user ex­pe­ri­ence Kelvin Tan. He added that staff have, as a re­sult, been able to work smarter and be more pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, clean­ers typ­i­cally make the rounds once a day to col­lect trash from each of Jewel’s shops. This could take about 1½ hours for just one level of the mall.</p>
    <p>Four LeoPull ro­bots, looka­like “sis­ters” of the LeoScrubs, now han­dle trash col­lec­tion on Jewel’s third level, with more to be de­ployed on other lev­els by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Each LeoPull tows a large cus­tomised trash bin and will stop in front of each shop and ring a bell to no­tify the tenant of its ar­rival. It does this en­tirely on its own, hav­ing been pro­grammed with the route.</p>
    <p>A suite of sen­sors also helps the robot avoid ob­sta­cles and peo­ple, and lets its op­er­a­tors know what it is up to at any one point. The op­er­a­tors can also give it in­struc­tions, if needed, via an app.</p>
    <p>Though they may be head-turn­ers, the LeoScrubs and LeoPulls are not Changi Air­port’s most pop­u­lar ro­bots.</p>
    <p>That dis­tinc­tion be­longs to the 1.3m-tall De­light robot, which roves around the con­fines of</p>
    <p>Jewel’s Canopy Park twice a day, of­fer­ing vis­i­tors free bot­tled drinks and sweets.</p>
    <p>“The De­light robot has proven very pop­u­lar since Canopy Park opened last year,” said Jewel Changi Air­port’s user ex­pe­ri­ence ex­ec­u­tive Euguene Tan, who is part of the team that over­sees Jewel’s ro­bots.</p>
    <p>“It is pro­grammed to fol­low a set</p>

    <p>route. But we can also man­u­ally trig­ger it to re­turn when the drinks run out.”</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited Canopy Park last Wed­nes­day, the De­light robot had barely gone 5m from its start­ing point when it was mobbed by vis­i­tors of all ages.</p>
