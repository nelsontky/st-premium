    <p>• Peo­ple who have re­ceived Covid-19 vac­cines will likely be pro­tected from the disease for more than half a year, a se­nior Chi­nese health of­fi­cial said, cit­ing find­ings from an­i­mal test­ing, clin­i­cal tri­als and med­i­cal fol­low-ups.</p>
    <p>An­i­mal tests con­ducted since Fe­bru­ary have shown that vac­ci­nated mon­keys ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus have been pro­tected from in­fec­tion, Global Times re­ported Dr Zeng Yixin, deputy di­rec­tor of China’s Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion, as say­ing on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>An­ti­bod­ies re­main present in peo­ple in­volved in China’s phase two clin­i­cal tri­als l aunched i n March, and hospi­tal fol­low-ups on re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients also found the an­ti­bod­ies in some pa­tients for up to 10 months, he said.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 vac­cine is un­likely to ren­der one im­mune to the disease for life, said Dr Yang Zhan­qiu, deputy di­rec­tor of the pathogen bi­ol­ogy depart­ment at</p>
    <p>Wuhan Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“The hu­man body’s im­mu­nity for the flu virus is gen­er­ally about one year, so we have to get the vac­cine ev­ery year,” Dr Yang told Global Times.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, it is be­lieved that the body’s im­mu­nity to coro­n­aviruses lasts for two to four years, so peo­ple may have to get re­vac­ci­nated a few years later, he said.</p>
    <p>China has al­ready ad­min­is­tered over one mil­lion Covid-19 vac­cines since July and plans to dis­trib­ute more, ini­tially tar­get­ing work­ers in in­dus­tries where there are higher risks of in­fec­tion, as it seeks to be at the van­guard of the global Covid-19 im­mu­ni­sa­tion ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines de­vel­oped by Si­no­vac Biotech and the state-owned China Na­tional Biotec Group (CNBG) have been dis­pensed in China since they were granted emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Zeng said China is now plan­ning wider dis­tri­bu­tion of the ex­per­i­men­tal shots, with those work­ing in hos­pi­tals, Cus­toms, pub­lic trans­port and cold-chain lo­gis­tics as well as vul­ner­a­ble groups to re­ceive them first.</p>
    <p>“Pri­ori­tis­ing them in im­mu­ni­sa­tion will not only pro­tect them against the risk of the virus, but also aid the coun­try’s ef­forts to pre­vent a resur­gence of the virus and fend off risks from over­seas,” Dr Zeng said, adding that a later phase of the roll-out will in­volve the gen­eral pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“Our goal is to achieve herd im­mu­nity through proac­tive im­mu­ni­sa­tion and curb the disease more ef­fec­tively as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The one mil­lion fig­ure refers to the num­ber of doses ad­min­is­tered, and not the peo­ple in­oc­u­lated.</p>
    <p>CNBG chair­man Yang Xiaom­ing said re­cently that more than 650,000 peo­ple had been vac­ci­nated with Chi­nese vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Both CNBG and Si­no­vac’s can­di­dates fol­low a two-shot reg­i­men.</p>
