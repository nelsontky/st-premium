    <p>Gemma Steak­house at the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore has been or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 20 days for hold­ing a din­ner for 75 guests on Oct 31 and not pre­vent­ing them from mix­ing, in a fla­grant vi­o­la­tion of Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures, the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA), which comes un­der the min­istry, found a pri­vate mem­bers’ club had worked with the restau­rant to or­gan­ise the Hal­loween­themed din­ner. It was at­tended by club mem­bers and their guests.</p>
    <p>Although the din­ers were seated at ta­bles of up to five, closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­era footage showed that they in­ter­min­gled on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions and failed to wear masks even when they were not eat­ing or drink­ing, MSE said. Footage also showed the restau­rant staff did not take rea­son­able steps to pre­vent in­ter­min­gling on their premises.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the club and those in­volved were not given. The min­istry said: “In­ves­ti­ga­tions are con­tin­u­ing in re­spect of pos­si­ble breaches by var­i­ous par­ties.”</p>
    <p>So­cial gath­er­ings of more than five per­sons are pro­hib­ited un­der Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions. Food and bev­er­age out­lets are also barred from ac­cept­ing book­ings from groups of more than five, even if they are split across ta­bles. In­ter­min­gling be­tween groups is not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>SFA is­sued an or­der re­quir­ing the restau­rant to close for 20 days from Thurs­day to Dec 22 for ac­cept­ing a large group book­ing and for fail­ing to take rea­son­able steps to pre­vent mul­ti­ple in­stances of in­ter­min­gling among din­ers.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Gallery said that when it was in­formed by the au­thor­i­ties of the in­ci­dent, it reached out to the out­let, which is man­aged by F&B op­er­a­tor Il Lido, and re­in­forced its pol­icy of strictly fol­low­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures (SMMs).</p>
    <p>“The Gallery also fa­cil­i­tated SFA’s</p>
    <p>in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the in­ci­dent, which sub­se­quently re­vealed that the restau­rant did not en­sure that the stip­u­lated SMMs were ad­hered to de­spite be­ing in­formed by the Gallery of gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tions,” it added.</p>
    <p>The Gallery said it has is­sued an of­fi­cial warn­ing let­ter to Il Lido on the breach and will re­in­force strict com­pli­ance of SMMs with ten­ants.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night, Gemma said it cre­ated a themed din­ner ex­pe­ri­ence for Oct 31 and mar­keted it to the data­base of a pri­vate mem­bers’ club which acted as its mar­ket­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>“For that night, the restau­rant re­ceived 17 reser­va­tions in dif­fer­ent ta­bles in groups of four to five guests per ta­ble, who came at dif­fer­ent tim­ings,” it said, ad­mit­ting that guests had in­ter­min­gled de­spite the restau­rant’s at­tempts</p>
    <p>to re­mind them.</p>
    <p>“The restau­rant is cog­nisant that it did not do enough to man­age the sit­u­a­tion, and is deeply sorry for its ac­tions,” it added, say­ing it has been co­op­er­at­ing with SFA and will take the next 20 days to re­in­force and en­hance SMMs.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, MSE said: “The Gov­ern­ment holds a se­ri­ous view of fla­grant breaches of SMMs.”</p>
    <p>“Din­ing out is an ac­tiv­ity that in­volves con­sid­er­able risks. It en­tails gath­er­ing in en­closed spa­ces, without masks on, and for a pro­longed du­ra­tion. While the ma­jor­ity have been ad­her­ing to the mea­sures, it is re­gret­table that there re­mains a mi­nor­ity which con­tinue to breach SMMs,” the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>“We will not he­si­tate to take strong en­force­ment ac­tion against op­er­a­tors and in­di­vid­u­als who treat SMMs with fla­grant dis­re­gard.”</p>
    <p>MSE urged peo­ple to be so­cially re­spon­si­ble, say­ing: “Our col­lec­tive ef­forts will de­ter­mine if we suc­cess­fully make the tran­si­tion to phase three.”</p>
