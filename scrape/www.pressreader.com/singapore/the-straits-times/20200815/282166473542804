    <p>Should the tu­ition in­dus­try be more tightly reg­u­lated?</p>
    <p>It is not just par­ents who are at the mercy of these cen­tres, teach­ers at these cen­tres suf­fer too. The tu­ition cen­tres earn big money while pay­ing their teach­ers mea­gre pay.</p>
    <p>Tam Chiak</p>
    <p>All par­ents are at the mercy of tu­ition cen­tres. Their fees re­main high even dur­ing this Covid-19 pe­riod. Some of them even in­creased their fees and we can’t do any­thing about it be­cause our kids are al­ready fa­mil­iar with the tu­tor.</p>
    <p>Alan Lee</p>
    <p>There should be con­trol over the qual­ity of teach­ers these cen­tres hire. Some of these teach­ers do not have proper train­ing, and cen­tres do not pro­vide in­for­ma­tion on the qual­i­fi­ca­tions and ex­pe­ri­ence of these teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Hui Teng Lim</p>
    <p>There are so many tu­ition cen­tres in Sin­ga­pore. There is no need to sign up with one if you do not agree with their terms. Sign­ing up sig­nals your con­sent and agree­ment.</p>
    <p>David Yong</p>
    <p>Why reg­u­late? It is a de­mand and sup­ply thing. If a tu­tor is too ex­pen­sive, look for an­other one.</p>
    <p>Kelvin Tan</p>
    <p>Tu­ition is just the symp­tom. What is the real root cause?</p>
    <p>Wa­ter Tay</p>
    <p>Not just the tu­ition in­dus­try, but the learn­ing hubs by var­i­ous ven­dors also need to be scru­ti­nised.</p>
    <p>Some of the ven­dors’ cour­ses are so ex­pen­sive. Some have patented soft­ware which trainees need to use in their lessons and then after that course, that soft­ware can­not be used any­more.</p>
    <p>Most of the class sizes are in the range of 40, with an av­er­age $1,000 course fee per stu­dent for on­line cour­ses, which run for two to three days.</p>
