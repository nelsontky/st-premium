    <p>Facelifts which do not i nclude changes to per­for­mance and han­dling are or­di­nar­ily not re­viewed in these pages. But these are not or­di­nary times.</p>
    <p>And the Audi S4 saloon and RS4 Avant (wagon) are no or­di­nary cars. The fact that they ar­rive at a time when there is a dearth of new models and that the RS4 is in Christ­mas green makes it harder for me to turn them down.</p>
    <p>And to be hon­est, I am glad I did not. The two cars are as in­tox­i­cat­ing as they were when I first drove them nearly 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>Since then, the per­for­mance gap be­tween the RS4 and S4 has nar­rowed con­sid­er­ably. Cur­rently, the RS4 clocks the cen­tury sprint in 4.1 sec­onds, while the S4 does so in 4.7 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>The 0.6-se­cond dif­fer­ence may be mean­ing­ful on a race­track, but on public roads, it isn’t. Both cars have an elec­tron­i­cally limited top speed of 250kmh.</p>
    <p>The two cars share the same en­gine block. But the RS4 one has a shorter stroke (hence a slightly smaller dis­place­ment), is fed by two tur­bos and uses a wa­ter-to-air in­ter­cooler.</p>
    <p>The S4’s en­gine has a higher com­pres­sion ra­tio (1:11.2 ver­sus the RS’ 1:10), em­ploys a sin­gle twin-scroll turbo, and an air-to-air in­ter­cooler.</p>
    <p>Both en­gines are paired with an eight-speed au­to­box, but the RS4’s trans­mis­sion is ra­tioed for more bru­tal take-offs, es­pe­cially in the first three cogs.</p>
    <p>The re­vised RS also gets a new Man­ual Sport shift mode. When you shift man­u­ally in Sport mode, gear changes are hard, fast and ac­com­pa­nied by ex­haust booms to make the ex­er­cise an oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the RS gets a fixed sports sus­pen­sion, while the S has an adap­tive sys­tem. On the go, this trans­lates into a firmer ride for the RS, which is sup­posed to gel with its more hard­core per­sona.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, daily com­mutes in the RS4 are still fairly cushy, which is not al­ways the case with cars sit­ting on sports sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>Speed aside, it is the RS4 which has a broader per­for­mance spec­trum. Driven leisurely, it is a civilised car­rier which goes about its busi­ness with ease.</p>
    <p>But the mo­ment the car senses a heav­ier right foot, it trans­forms into a hairy-chested rub­ber-burn­ing beast. Flick the gear lever to S mode and the trans­for­ma­tion be­comes even more acute, as the trans­mis­sion pro­gram de­lays up­shifts to give the car ex­plo­sive get­aways.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­ny­ing this is a lovely throaty growl, which rises from the car’s belly to en­velop the en­tire cabin. Down­shifts are paired with au­to­matic throt­tle blip­ping. The whole sporty sym­phony is de­li­ciously ad­dic­tive.</p>
    <p>You do not have to go i nto Man­ual Sport to en­joy the mu­sic, but do­ing so turns up the vol­ume and quick­ens the beat con­sid­er­ably, which is a good thing.</p>
    <p>The S4, which has nearly all the tech­ni­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties of the RS4, is also tuned for ef­fi­cient mo­tor­ing. It de­liv­ers speed and pre­ci­sion, while do­ing away with much of the sound, lights and drama.</p>
    <p>On tar­mac out­side of a cir­cuit, it will prob­a­bly give the RS4 a good run for its money, while its oc­cu­pants en­joy what­ever is play­ing on the stereo.</p>
    <p>For those who want 90 per cent of what the ma­ni­a­cal RS can do, and who pre­fer a more gen­teel ap­proach to per­for­mance, the S is a good choice. No other mar­que fills this unique seg­ment half as well as Audi.</p>
    <p>But if I had the means, I would pick the RS4 over the S4 in a heart­beat.</p>
    <p>It may be the wild child of the two, cost nearly $80,000 more, and will likely in­cur your neigh­bours’ ire each time you fire it up, but it is just what the doc­tor has or­dered to lift you out of mun­dan­ity.</p>
