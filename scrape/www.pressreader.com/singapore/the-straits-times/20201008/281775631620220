    <p>The hear­ing for the defama­tion law­suit brought by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong against blog­ger and fi­nan­cial ad­viser Leong Sze Hian has been ad­journed un­til Nov 30, when the court will hear fur­ther oral sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Justice Aedit Ab­dul­lah yes­ter­day ended the sched­uled four-day hear­ing at the close of the sec­ond day, af­ter Mr Leong’s lawyer Lim Tean told the court he had ad­vised his client that it was un­nec­es­sary for him to give ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim noted that there were nine is­sues be­fore the court, and said the bur­den of proof for eight of them lies with PM Lee, who is su­ing Mr Leong for shar­ing an ar­ti­cle from Malaysian news site The Cov­er­age. The ar­ti­cle had falsely linked PM Lee to the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) cor­rup­tion scan­dal in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>These is­sues in­cluded whether or not the of­fend­ing words in the post Mr Leong had shared on his Face­book page should be un­der­stood to mean that he was sug­gest­ing PM Lee was com­plicit in crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity in the 1MDB scan­dal and helped for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak to laun­der money.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Lim: “The de­ter­mi­na­tion of the mean­ing of an al­legedly defam­a­tory post is not a mat­ter upon which any ev­i­dence can be ad­duced, mean­ing it’s a mat­ter for sub­mis­sions.”</p>
    <p>He added that PM Lee also had to prove, among other things, whether Mr Leong’s Face­book post con­sti­tuted sub­stan­tial pub­li­ca­tion and re­pub­li­ca­tion of these words in Sin­ga­pore, whether Mr Leong was ma­li­cious and ag­gra­vated the li­bel through his sub­se­quent ac­tions, and whether the Prime Min­is­ter is en­ti­tled to the dam­ages he is claim­ing.</p>
    <p>These are also not mat­ters in which Mr Leong’s ev­i­dence is ma­te­rial and can be dealt with in sub­mis­sions, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>The is­sues also hinge on whether li­a­bil­ity is es­tab­lished and whether dam­ages are awarded, he added.</p>
    <p>The one is­sue in which the bur­den of proof lies with Mr Leong is whether or not PM Lee’s de­ci­sion to sue him is an abuse of court process, said Mr Lim. This, too, will be dealt with in his sub­mis­sions, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee’s lawyer, Senior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, said Mr Lim’s rea­sons were not cred­i­ble as noth­ing he had said was new.</p>
    <p>“He and his client have al­ways known that, but for the is­sue of abuse of process, the bur­den of proof on the is­sues lies with the plain­tiff. Fur­ther, he and the de­fen­dant have al­ways known what our case was on each is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh noted that Mr Leong’s af­fi­davit had said he would present him­self for cross-ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“There­fore it is my sub­mis­sion that the de­fen­dant has never had any in­ten­tion of tak­ing the stand to be cross-ex­am­ined and what is to­day be­ing said as the rea­sons for him not do­ing so are, with the great­est re­spect, con­trived,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh also quoted Mr Leong’s Face­book post on Dec 24, 2018, an­nounc­ing his coun­ter­suit against PM Lee that the Court of Ap­peal dis­missed in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>“Whilst it may be my name on the case file, this ac­tion is big­ger than my name, big­ger than just the one or­di­nary Sin­ga­porean that I am. It is for ev­ery Sin­ga­porean to­day who has ever shared a post on Face­book, for ev­ery child who will share a post on Face­book and for the un­born gen­er­a­tions to come,” Mr Singh quoted Mr Leong as hav­ing said.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong fur­ther wrote: “I am very sad and dis­ap­pointed at our PM’s ac­tions, but I am equally hum­bled and heart­ened that the char­ac­ter of our Sin­ga­porean peo­ple will pre­vail, and to­gether we can show the PM and his ad­vis­ers that they can­not use defama­tion suits to si­lence or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said it is ironic that Mr Leong has cho­sen to si­lence him­self by not tak­ing the wit­ness stand.</p>
    <p>“We have a sit­u­a­tion where the plain­tiff has turned up in court and gone into the stand, un­afraid of any ques­tions and ready to de­fend his po­si­tion. And yet the per­son who al­leges that he has abused the process of the court has turned tail and fled,” he added.</p>
    <p>“This is deeply dis­ap­point­ing. (Mr Leong) has not just let him­self down, he has let his sup­port­ers and Sin­ga­pore­ans down be­cause, af­ter claim­ing he would stand up, he has done the very op­po­site and avoided the fight.”</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing, Mr Lim said: “Your Hon­our, I can­not help but think that what my learned friend has just said was in the na­ture of a po­lit­i­cal speech de­signed for pub­li­ca­tion in the main­stream me­dia to­mor­row to hu­mil­i­ate my client.” He also said PM Lee’s case is “so friv­o­lous and vex­a­tious as to be laugh­able and should be laughed out of court”.</p>
