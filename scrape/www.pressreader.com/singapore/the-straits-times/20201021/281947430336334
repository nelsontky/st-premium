    <p>WASHINGTON The fi­nal de­bate be­tween United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den will fea­ture a mute but­ton to al­low each can­di­date to speak un­in­ter­rupted, or­gan­is­ers have said, look­ing to avoid the dis­rup­tions that marred the first match-up.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign voiced ob­jec­tions to the change – made af­ter the Pres­i­dent re­peat­edly talked over both Mr Bi­den and the mod­er­a­tor at last month’s de­bate in vi­o­la­tion of the agreed-upon rules – but said the Repub­li­can would still take part in to­mor­row’s event, one of his last chances to reach a large prime­time au­di­ence be­fore vot­ing ends on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>The Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates said on Mon­day that each can­di­date’s mi­cro­phone at the de­bate in Nashville, Ten­nessee, would be si­lenced to al­low the other to make two min­utes of open­ing re­marks at the be­gin­ning of each 15-minute seg­ment of the de­bate.</p>
    <p>Both mi­cro­phones will be turned on to al­low a back and forth af­ter that time.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump is com­mit­ted to de­bat­ing Joe Bi­den re­gard­less of last-minute rule changes from the bi­ased com­mis­sion in their lat­est at­tempt to pro­vide ad­van­tage to their favoured can­di­date,” cam­paign man­ager Bill Stepien said.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>More than 30 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have al­ready cast their bal­lots, lim­it­ing Mr Trump’s chances of re­fram­ing a con­test that na­tional and state opin­ion polls show him trail­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­peat­edly in­ter­rupted Mr Bi­den dur­ing a chaotic and ill-tem­pered de­bate on Sept 29, at one point provoking Mr Bi­den to snap: “Will you shut up, man?”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump backed out of a sec­ond sched­uled de­bate, set for last Thurs­day, over a dis­agree­ment about the vir­tual for­mat fol­low­ing his Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>At that time, he raised con­cerns about hav­ing his mi­cro­phone muted.</p>
    <p>“You sit be­hind a com­puter and do a de­bate – it’s ridicu­lous, and then they cut you off when­ever they want,” Mr Trump said in an Oct 8 in­ter­view on Fox Busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Mon­day, Mr Trump’s cam­paign said it was un­happy with the an­nounced set of top­ics for to­mor­row’s de­bate, ar­gu­ing that it should fo­cus more on for­eign pol­icy and as­sert­ing that the non-par­ti­san group was tilted to­ward Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>As he re­turned to Washington from ral­lies in Ari­zona, Mr Trump told re­porters aboard Air Force One: “I will par­tic­i­pate, but it’s very</p>
    <p>CHANGE OF TOP­ICS UN­FAIR</p>
    <p>un­fair that they changed the top­ics and it’s very un­fair that again, we have an an­chor who’s to­tally bi­ased.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kris­ten Welker of NBC News, a re­spected White House re­porter, is slated to an­chor the de­bate.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign said both sides pre­vi­ously agreed to let mod­er­a­tors choose the sub­jects.</p>
    <p>It added that Mr Trump wanted to avoid dis­cussing his stew­ard­ship of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which sur­veys show is the top is­sue for vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“As usual, the Pres­i­dent is more con­cerned with the rules of a de­bate than he is get­ting a na­tion in cri­sis the help it needs,” said Mr T.J. Ducklo, spokesman for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said on Mon­day that he would test for the coro­n­avirus be­fore the de­bate.</p>
    <p>“Sure, I would have no prob­lem with that,” he told re­porters, when</p>
    <p>asked if he would be tested.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Amer­i­cans who voted early reached 30.2 mil­lion on Mon­day, ac­cord­ing to the Univer­sity of Florida’s United States Elec­tions Pro­ject.</p>
    <p>That num­ber rep­re­sents more than one-fifth of all the votes cast in the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Early vot­ing is likely to ramp up this week as more states open up vot­ing cen­tres for those who want to avoid pos­si­ble coro­n­avirus ex­po­sure at crowded elec­tion day polling sites.</p>
    <p>In Florida, where more than 2.5 mil­lion have al­ready voted by mail, res­i­dents lined up for the first day of early in-per­son vot­ing.</p>
    <p>A Reuters/Ip­sos poll re­leased last week showed Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den ef­fec­tively tied in the state, which is seen as a must-win for the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>I will par­tic­i­pate, but it’s very un­fair that they changed the top­ics and it’s very un­fair that again, we have an an­chor who’s to­tally bi­ased.</p>
