    <p>Citi Sin­ga­pore and its busi­ness part­ners yes­ter­day do­nated about $240,000 to sup­port fund-rais­ing con­cert ChildAid.</p>
    <p>This brings the to­tal amount do­nated this year by Citi Sin­ga­pore and its part­ners to around $390,000. The bank con­trib­uted $150,000 to ChildAid in July.</p>
    <p>ChildAid is an an­nual event in sup­port of The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF) and The Busi­ness Times Bud­ding Artists Fund (BTBAF). STSPMF gives stu­dents a monthly al­lowance for school-re­lated ex­penses, while BTBAF helps young peo­ple pay for lessons in the arts.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, Citi Sin­ga­pore holds its Citi & Part­ners Char­ity Golf event to raise funds for Sin­ga­porean chil­dren from fi­nan­cially needy fam­i­lies. This year’s event, how­ever, was can­celled ow­ing to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The bank then launched the Citi & Part­ners Sup­port ChildAid ini­tia­tive last month, rop­ing in busi­ness part­ners like com­puter gi­ant Dell Tech­nolo­gies, soft­ware so­lu­tions provider Nice and tech ser­vice provider World Wide Tech­nol­ogy, among many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The month-long cam­paign was also held in con­junc­tion with SG Cares Giv­ing Week 2020, which is or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Vol­un­teer and Phi­lan­thropy Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Mr Amol Gupte, Citi’s Asean head and coun­try of­fi­cer for Sin­ga­pore, said: “We are pleased that Citi is able to con­tinue sup­port­ing ChildAid, es­pe­cially in a chal­leng­ing year. What makes our ef­forts even more mean­ing­ful is that we were able to bring our part­ners to­gether to sup­port a wor­thy cause.”</p>
    <p>Since 2002, Citi has raised close to $6.6 mil­lion i n sup­port of STSPMF and BTBAF.</p>
    <p>Ms Stacey Lacy, Citi’s Asia-Pa­cific chief in­for­ma­tion of­fi­cer and head of op­er­a­tions and tech­nol­ogy, said: “We deeply be­lieve that no child should be de­prived of the op­por­tu­nity to gain knowl­edge through ed­u­ca­tion, and to pur­sue his or her pas­sion in the arts. With our deep­est grat­i­tude to our part­ners, we were able to con­tinue mak­ing a dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>This year marks the 16th an­niver­sary of ChildAid, with a vir­tual con­cert held in June. Mr Helmi Yu­sof, or­gan­is­ing co-chair­man of ChildAid 2020, said: “Over the years, Citi’s do­na­tions have helped close to 180,000 fi­nan­cially dis­ad­van­taged chil­dren pay for lunch, take trans­port to and from school, and pur­sue dif­fer­ent art forms for their per­sonal de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“In 2020, Citi’s do­na­tions go even fur­ther by help­ing our ben­e­fi­cia­ries and their fam­i­lies weather the eco­nomic down­turn.”</p>
