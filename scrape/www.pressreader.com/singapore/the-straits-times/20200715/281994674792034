    <p>With the hus­tings over, it’s time to get down to the busi­ness of fix­ing the econ­omy. As we have heard through­out the elec­tion cam­paign, the big­gest issue that needs to be ad­dressed is jobs.</p>
    <p>It may get even big­ger, be­cause the “in­sol­vency phase” of the Covid-19 eco­nomic cri­sis has yet to play out. The worse-than-ex­pected flash es­ti­mates of a 12.6 per cent year-on-year de­cline in the sec­ond quar­ter’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) and the dra­matic 41.2 per cent quar­ter-on-quar­ter de­cline – which con­firms that we are in a re­ces­sion – are a sober­ing in­di­ca­tion of the eco­nomic dam­age al­ready done.</p>
    <p>While the post-cir­cuit breaker growth num­bers may get bet­ter, the same may not be true of jobs. So far, many jobs have been pro­tected and com­pa­nies kept alive by the var­i­ous mea­sures in the four Bud­gets that we have had since Fe­bru­ary – in par­tic­u­lar, the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), which has pro­vided wage sub­si­dies of up to 75 per cent for lo­cal work­ers sub­ject to a ceil­ing of $4,600 per month per worker. The JSS has prob­a­bly pre­vented thou­sands of lay­offs so far. But it will ta­per off by the year end, un­less it is ex­tended.</p>
    <p>Many other schemes are also time-bound and will end be­fore the year is out, such as the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme, which pro­vides cash pay­outs to self-em­ployed work­ers, rental waivers for busi­nesses and the de­fer­ral of cer­tain con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions for busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als. More­over, some com­pa­nies which have man­aged to keep afloat by bor­row­ing, un­der the var­i­ous loan sub­sidy schemes on of­fer, will be bur­dened with ad­di­tional debt.</p>
    <p>IN­SOL­VEN­CIES RIS­ING</p>
    <p>Once the fi­nan­cial props fall away, we are likely to see busi­ness in­sol­ven­cies ac­cel­er­at­ing, es­pe­cially in the hard­est-hit sec­tors, such as restau­rants, re­tail, hos­pi­tal­ity, con­struc­tion, en­ter­tain­ment and even some parts of man­u­fac­tur­ing, which have been hit by dis­rupted sup­ply chains and col­laps­ing de­mand in ex­port mar­kets. Some of these com­pa­nies’ fi­nan­cial strains go be­yond tem­po­rary cash-flow prob­lems. On top of in­sol­ven­cies, there will also be lay­offs by com­pa­nies that re­main in busi­ness but need to re­duce their head­count to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Many of the lost jobs will not come back. While this hap­pens in all re­ces­sions, it will be more wide­spread this time, be­cause com­pany at­tri­tion will be un­usu­ally high and more in­dus­tries will be trans­formed.</p>
    <p>While the pro­long­ing of gov­ern­ment fi­nan­cial sup­port – which is pos­si­ble – may buy more time, job cre­ation would be the best way to ar­rest a down­ward eco­nomic spi­ral. But this will be chal­leng­ing in the midst of a lo­cal and global re­ces­sion that is, if any­thing, only get­ting worse.</p>
    <p>As the chair­man of the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil, Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, said dur­ing the coun­cil’s first meet­ing last month: Cre­at­ing jobs and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties will have to be done “on a scale well be­yond any past ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has pledged to cre­ate at least 100,000 new jobs. Many of these will take the form of trainee­ships and ap­pren­tice­ships rather than full-time or per­ma­nent po­si­tions, but they will be jobs none­the­less and some could be­come path­ways to per­ma­nent em­ploy­ment. The pub­lic sec­tor also plans to step up its hir­ing. These mea­sures will help.</p>
    <p>AN AM­BI­TIOUS TAR­GET</p>
    <p>Even so, the tar­get for jobs is am­bi­tious. For one thing, many of the lay­offs will be among low-skilled, blue-col­lar or ser­vice work­ers, at least at first. Many of the va­can­cies, how­ever, will be in a hand­ful of healthy or grow­ing sec­tors, such as bio­med­i­cal, IT ser­vices, e-com­merce lo­gis­tics, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and high-end man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>More­over, across the board, com­pa­nies are ramp­ing up their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts. While this is the smart thing to do in an era of re­mote work and ris­ing dig­i­tal adop­tion by con­sumers, it will cre­ate an ad­di­tional bar­rier for many job seek­ers. Match­ing lower-skilled and mid-ca­reer blue-col­lar work­ers who have lost their jobs with em­ploy­ers look­ing to hire for mainly higher-skilled po­si­tions will be a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is pro­vid­ing sub­si­dies for train­ing, which will help pre­pare work­ers for new types of jobs. But even then, some work­ers may find it dif­fi­cult to se­cure po­si­tions for which they are con­sid­ered qual­i­fied.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem will be com­pounded by the fact that, as Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat pointed out in the East Coast GRC’s first on­line rally dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign: “Our work­ers now will have to com­pete with work­ers all over the world.”</p>
    <p>The rise of re­mote work means that many white-col­lar jobs – es­pe­cially those in­volv­ing a dig­i­tal com­po­nent – can be done from any­where. There are lower-in­come coun­tries, in­clud­ing some in the re­gion, that al­ready have mil­lions of dig­i­tally qual­i­fied and ex­pe­ri­enced work­ers look­ing for jobs, some of whom are of­fer­ing their ser­vices on dig­i­tal free­lance plat­forms with global reach, such as Fiverr, Up­work and TaskRab­bit. Even some higher-end ser­vices such as ed­u­ca­tion, telemedici­ne and con­sult­ing are now be­ing de­liv­ered re­motely.</p>
    <p>The global job mar­ket on these dig­i­tal plat­forms is in­tensely com­pet­i­tive, with work­ers be­ing rated for their work as well as com­pet­ing on price. And at this time, with job­less­ness on the rise ev­ery­where, it’s a buyer’s mar­ket for tal­ent. Com­pa­nies have a vast range of choices when it comes to hir­ing dig­i­tally savvy work­ers.</p>
    <p>Of course, the flip side of this work-from-any­where trend is that Sin­ga­pore-based work­ers, too, can of­fer their dig­i­tal ser­vices glob­ally – and such op­por­tu­ni­ties should be en­cour­aged. But it will not be easy in such a com­pet­i­tive mar­ket­place, es­pe­cially for newly qual­i­fied work­ers with lim­ited, or no ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>THE GROW­ING GIG ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>So, what are the other op­tions for job cre­ation? One is to en­sure the smooth func­tion­ing of the “gig econ­omy”, which is likely to ex­pand dur­ing the Covid-19 eco­nomic cri­sis. As lay­offs gather pace in the com­ing months, many more work­ers will be forced into self-em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>One of the im­por­tant fea­tures of the gig econ­omy is that its work­ers of­ten serve mul­ti­ple em­ploy­ers, some­times at the same time, and per­form not just jobs – some of which are part-time – but also</p>
    <p>“tasks”, which may take just a few days, or even a few hours and which can be per­formed only lo­cally. For ex­am­ple, a com­pany may want work­ers for three days to help with a prod­uct launch; a start-up may want a lo­cal con­sul­tant to come up with a go-to-mar­ket strat­egy in two weeks; an el­derly per­son may need care­giv­ing ser­vices for a few hours.</p>
    <p>There will need to be plat­forms that match lo­cal de­mand and sup­ply for such gig ser­vices, broadly de­fined to in­clude tasks. This would help cre­ate not only jobs but, more im­por­tantly, in­comes.</p>
    <p>An­other op­tion is to cre­ate new jobs in ar­eas where re­mote work is not pos­si­ble. In many coun­tries, pub­lic works – which can be done only on-site – is the go-to op­tion to cre­ate mass jobs quickly. But in Sin­ga­pore, this might cre­ate more jobs for for­eign work­ers than lo­cals.</p>
    <p>One pro­posal, en­dorsed by the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign, is to open up more po­si­tions in sec­tors like con­struc­tion as well as the marine sec­tor and ship­yards to lo­cal work­ers. Em­ploy­ing more lo­cals in these in­dus­tries, cur­rently dom­i­nated by for­eign work­ers, might seem rad­i­cal in Sin­ga­pore, but it is a com­mon prac­tice in other ad­vanced economies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could em­u­late them by ex­tend­ing the pro­gres­sive wage model to these sec­tors with the help of sub­si­dies, to bring wages closer to a liv­ing-wage level, with jobs be­ing up­graded over time, while re­duc­ing the in­take of for­eign work­ers. This would cre­ate jobs at scale which would not need ex­ten­sive train­ing or high ed­u­ca­tional qual­i­fi­ca­tions. Such a pol­icy would also ac­cel­er­ate au­to­ma­tion in these sec­tors, fur­ther re­duc­ing the reliance on low-wage for­eign work­ers, which in any case should be a medium-term goal.</p>
    <p>NO TIME FOR A MIN­I­MUM WAGE</p>
    <p>Some po­lit­i­cal par­ties have called for a min­i­mum wage across the board. But this would not be ad­vis­able, at least dur­ing this re­ces­sion. Some re­search shows that a min­i­mum wage pol­icy runs the risk of higher unemployme­nt (though this is not al­ways the case ev­ery­where) be­cause it can de­ter hir­ing, which is not an out­come Sin­ga­pore needs right now.</p>
    <p>Such a pol­icy would be tough on small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) – which em­ploy more than two-thirds of work­ers – and would likely be re­sisted by many em­ploy­ers. It would also in­cen­tivise com­pa­nies to hire more re­mote white-col­lar work­ers from other coun­tries who might be will­ing to do the same job at a frac­tion of the min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>A min­i­mum wage pol­icy should also ide­ally be pre­ceded by some form of unemployme­nt in­sur­ance, which Sin­ga­pore does not have.</p>
    <p>The idea of such in­sur­ance is worth re­vis­it­ing. In nor­mal times and nor­mal cycli­cal down­turns, there may be plau­si­ble ar­gu­ments against it to the ef­fect that it would dis­cour­age work, de­ter com­pa­nies from pay­ing re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, and that Sin­ga­pore has weath­ered many re­ces­sions with­out it.</p>
    <p>But this is no nor­mal re­ces­sion. Some economists have pre­dicted that job losses could run as high as 200,000 this year – more than four times as high as dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008. If the re­ces­sion is pro­longed and ex­tends into next year, re­trench­ment ben­e­fits may not be suf­fi­cient to tide over those who are re­trenched. How much com­pa­nies – es­pe­cially SMEs – would be able to af­ford to pay would also be in doubt.</p>
    <p>Un­der this sce­nario, and even if 100,000 jobs are cre­ated as planned, the Gov­ern­ment would need to ex­tend fi­nan­cial sup­port far be­yond the Tem­po­rary Re­lief Fund and the Covid-19 sup­port grants cur­rently avail­able to those who have lost their jobs. If unemployme­nt in­sur­ance is ruled out, there would need to be al­ter­na­tive pro­tec­tions for the un­em­ployed that are less ad hoc in na­ture.</p>
    <p>The loom­ing job cri­sis that will un­fold over the com­ing months will se­verely test pol­i­cy­mak­ers. It will need all the qual­i­ties of unity, sol­i­dar­ity, re­silience and for­ti­tude af­ter which the four Bud­gets were named. It will also need pre-emp­tive, quick-act­ing and un­ortho­dox reme­dies that go be­yond the pol­icy play­books of re­ces­sions past.</p>
