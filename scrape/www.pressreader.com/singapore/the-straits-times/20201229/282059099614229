    <p>A lo­cal con­trac­tor was fined $8,500 for an in­ci­dent that led to wa­ter con­tam­i­na­tion at a pri­vate con­do­minium near River Val­ley Road, said na­tional wa­ter agency PUB yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ever­rise Main­te­nance was con­victed on Dec 1 for fail­ing to en­sure that reg­u­lated works were car­ried out by a li­censed plumber.</p>
    <p>It re­sulted in con­tam­i­na­tion to wa­ter sup­plied by PUB to Water­ford Residence on Sept 8.</p>
    <p>PUB said that after it re­ceived calls from res­i­dents about a smell in the wa­ter on Sept 9, it im­me­di­ately sent of­fi­cers to jointly in­ves­ti­gate the in­ci­dent with the con­do­minium’s manag­ing agent (MA).</p>
    <p>“The smell was traced to one of the two com­part­ments in the high-level wa­ter tank, which was im­me­di­ately isolated to con­duct flush­ing works.</p>
    <p>“The MA also con­ducted a full flush of the ser­vice pipes, which led to dis­rup­tion of wa­ter sup­ply to 60 res­i­den­tial units in the af­fected block for about three hours,” said PUB.</p>
    <p>Ever­rise Main­te­nance was hired by the MA to carry out re­pair works after an ap­prox­i­mately 10cm long crack was found on the wa­ter tank cover of one of the con­do­minium’s high­level tanks.</p>
    <p>In­stead of hir­ing a li­censed plumber, Ever­rise Main­te­nance told its work­ers to fix the crack line with­out proper in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>The work­ers ap­plied sealant on both the ex­te­rior as well as the in­te­rior of the wa­ter tank cover, caus­ing wa­ter in­side the tank to be con­tam­i­nated.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Pub­lic Util­i­ties Act, those con­victed of caus­ing con­tam­i­na­tion to wa­ter sup­plied by PUB can be fined up to $50,000, while fail­ure to en­sure reg­u­lated works are car­ried out by a li­censed plumber car­ries a max­i­mum fine of $10,000.</p>
    <p>“We would like to re­mind all cus­tomers and build­ing own­ers that reg­u­lated work on all wa­ter ser­vice in­stal­la­tions, in­clud­ing wa­ter stor­age tanks, must be car­ried out by a li­censed plumber,” said Mr Ridzuan Is­mail, direc­tor of Wa­ter Sup­ply (Net­work) at PUB.</p>
    <p>He added: “Build­ing own­ers are also re­spon­si­ble for the reg­u­lar main­te­nance of the wa­ter ser­vice in­stal­la­tions, in­clud­ing the need to en­gage a li­censed plumber to in­spect and cer­tify, at least once ev­ery 12 months, that the tanks are fit and safe for the stor­age of potable wa­ter and free from con­tam­i­na­tion or pol­lu­tion, and en­sure that there is no leak­age or like­li­hood of leak­age in the wa­ter ser­vice in­stal­la­tions.”</p>
