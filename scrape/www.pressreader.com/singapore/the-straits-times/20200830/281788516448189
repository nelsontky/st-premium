    <p>Non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Women in Iden­tity (WiD), which cham­pi­ons di­ver­sity in the dig­i­tal iden­tity sphere, launched its Sin­ga­pore chap­ter on Friday with a vir­tual event.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal iden­tity is a sub­set of the dig­i­tal in­dus­try that is cen­tred on the use of per­sonal in­for­ma­tion to ac­cess pub­lic- and pri­vate-sec­tor ser­vices.</p>
    <p>At the event, Se­cond Min­is­ter of Fi­nance In­dra­nee Ra­jah gave the key­note speech and took part in a panel dis­cus­sion on the chal­lenges in at­tract­ing women to Stem (sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics) ca­reers and the im­por­tance of dig­i­tal iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee, who is also Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, noted that the Covid-19 pan­demic has “turbo-charged” the speed of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion here, cit­ing how work­ing from home, shop­ping on­line and or­der­ing food for de­liv­ery are the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“All of these moves lead to the im­por­tance of hav­ing a dig­i­tal iden­tity. To dig­i­talise suc­cess­fully, we need a dig­i­tal iden­tity that can be used widely and se­curely.</p>
    <p>“A na­tional dig­i­tal iden­tity helps to catal­yse busi­ness in­no­va­tions, and brings con­ve­nience to cit­i­zens and busi­nesses,” she said.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a dig­i­tal iden­tity has been ben­e­fi­cial, she said, as apps like SafeEn­try and TraceTo­gether aid con­tact-trac­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has high­lighted the need to en­sure every­one is part of dig­i­tal growth, she said, adding: “We saw how se­niors, or the less ed­u­cated or those from low-in­come house­holds, had a much harder time than those who were dig­i­tally equipped and dig­i­tally savvy.”</p>
    <p>She also said the Sin­ga­pore chap­ter of WiD would “con­trib­ute greatly to en­sur­ing that women are right up there in the van­guard of those with dig­i­tal iden­tity”.</p>
    <p>In the panel dis­cus­sion, she ad­dressed pri­vacy con­cerns over TraceTo­gether, say­ing the Govern­ment col­lects data on in­di­vid­u­als only if the need arises.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sion also touched on the paucity of women in the cor­po­rate and tech­nol­ogy sec­tor, with a pan­el­list, Ms Rama Srid­har, not­ing that it is a prom­i­nent is­sue for many pro­gres­sive or­gan­i­sa­tions, and “we should see change in the com­ing years”. She is Master­card’s Asia-Pa­cific ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent of dig­i­tal and emerg­ing part­ner­ships and new pay­ment flows.</p>
    <p>On Stem, Ms In­dra­nee said it is key to at­tract girls to such sub­jects from an early age by ac­tively guid­ing them when they make choices, such as what to study in school and what ca­reers to pur­sue.</p>
