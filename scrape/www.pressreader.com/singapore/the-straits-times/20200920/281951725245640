    <p>Smoke from Cal­i­for­nia and Ore­gon wildfires has cloaked Canada’s third-largest city of Van­cou­ver – known for its ma­jes­tic moun­tain views and fresh ocean breezes – in the dirt­i­est air in the world this past week.</p>
    <p>Days have been spent smart­ing un­der a thick haze that has ir­ri­tated eyes and throats, and sent asth­mat­ics gasp­ing for breath. It has also com­pli­cated Covid-19 test­ing.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, de­spite ex­pected smoke-clear­ing rain­storms, the city – 1,300km north of the big­gest Cal­i­for­nia fires – topped, for the sec­ond time in the week, the World Air Qual­ity In­dex for worst air, af­ter briefly ced­ing first place to Port­land in fire-stricken Ore­gon in the United States.</p>
    <p>“I’m out of breath all the time, my chest feels like it’s ex­plod­ing, I feel like I’m go­ing to suf­fo­cate,” said Univer­sity of Bri­tish Columbia doc­toral stu­dent Fa­tima Jaf­fer.</p>
    <p>“I’m afraid of the long-term dam­age this smoke might do to my lungs and my asthma.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties for the metropoli­tan re­gion of 2.5 mil­lion residents have is­sued daily air qual­ity warn­ings since Sept 8, with things so bad that Van­cou­ver opened five fil­tered “clean air shel­ters”.</p>
    <p>It is equiv­a­lent to smok­ing eight cig­a­rettes a day, re­searchers noted. Of­fi­cials urged peo­ple to close win­dows and avoid stren­u­ous ex­er­cise or out­door ac­tiv­i­ties – es­pe­cially those with re­s­pi­ra­tory ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Ms Jaf­fer, 58, said her wors­en­ing asthma added to a sense of panic and dread, as she had just re­cov­ered from Covid-19, which robbed her of her sense of smell.</p>
    <p>Now, she wor­ries the smog could in­crease her odds of re­in­fec­tion or cause new health com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“I’d just got­ten to the place of get­ting over the fear of Covid-19 and felt like I could breathe again,” she said, “and now I lit­er­ally can’t.”</p>
    <p>It has been an “en­tire hor­ri­ble week for air qual­ity”, said Mr Armel Castel­lan, a fed­eral warn­ing pre­pared­ness me­te­o­rol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>“The fine par­tic­u­late has brought our Air Qual­ity Health In­dex up off the charts. “There’s no doubt this is very mas­sive and very con­cern­ing.”</p>
    <p>The same peo­ple are at most risk of smoke in­hala­tion and the coro­n­avirus, ac­cord­ing to pro­vin­cial health of­fi­cer Bon­nie Henry.</p>
    <p>The past month has seen Bri­tish Columbia’s ac­tive Covid-19 cases surge 130 per cent, hit­ting highs more than dou­ble those at the pan­demic’s April peak.</p>
    <p>“For many of us, there’s con­fu­sion about what symp­toms are caused by smoky skies, and what symp­toms are caused by Covid-19,” Dr Henry told a news con­fer­ence, “par­tic­u­larly for peo­ple who have un­der­ly­ing lung dis­ease, asthma, heart dis­ease and di­a­betes.”</p>
    <p>An­other vul­ner­a­ble group are the more than 2,000 home­less peo­ple, many of whom have chronic ill­ness, a re­cent sur­vey found.</p>
    <p>“If you’re out­side and home­less, and sur­rounded by this smoke and the pan­demic, you can’t get away from any of th­ese things,” said Mr Jeremy Hunka of the Union Gospel Mis­sion. “It’s hit­ting a group of peo­ple that gen­er­ally have been just left far more vul­ner­a­ble.”</p>
    <p>For North Van­cou­ver pro­fes­sional dog-walker Barry Ap­pal, 64, he and his wife, who is 10 years his se­nior, have had to wear masks out­doors and avoid usual stren­u­ous trails. “Af­ter a half-hour you could feel it in your lungs and get a headache,” he said. “We’re ac­tive and healthy, but with Covid-19 around, pick­ing up any re­s­pi­ra­tory thing could be­come a big­ger prob­lem than normal.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ap­pal is most wor­ried for his 30-some­thing nephew who suf­fers from cys­tic fi­bro­sis, say­ing: “He’s very sus­cep­ti­ble to any­thing to do with his lungs.</p>
    <p>“He’s al­ready freaked out about Covid – that could wipe him right out at the drop of a hat.”</p>
    <p>Mr Castel­lan, the me­te­o­rol­o­gist, said con­di­tions should im­prove this week thanks to brew­ing Pa­cific storms clear­ing the air.</p>
    <p>But with the “fin­ger­prints of cli­mate change” clearly vis­i­ble in the year-af­ter-year wors­en­ing wild­fire sea­sons, he warned that “we’re not done with this yet”.</p>
