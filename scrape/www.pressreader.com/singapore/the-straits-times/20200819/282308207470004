    <p>NEW YORK • This will be the most un­usual US Open in his­tory, with no spec­ta­tors, an all-but-empty Arthur Ashe Sta­dium and play­ers fol­low­ing ex­ten­sive health and safety guide­lines be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment will also have the weak­est women’s field in its his­tory in terms of top-10 play­ers.</p>
    <p>The lat­est blow came on Mon­day when world No. 2 Si­mona Halep with­drew. Lead­ing play­ers have con­tin­ued to with­draw de­spite New York’s low rate of in­fec­tions and event or­gan­is­ers’ ef­forts to cre­ate a strictly mon­i­tored en­vi­ron­ment for play­ers and their teams.</p>
    <p>Six of the top eight women are out, in­clud­ing world No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty of Aus­tralia, Elina Svi­tolina of Ukraine (No. 5), Bianca An­dreescu of Canada (No. 6), Kiki Bertens of the Nether­lands (No. 7) and Belinda Ben­cic of Switzer­land (No. 8).</p>
    <p>That leaves the hard-court Grand Slam, sched­uled for Aug 31, with­out three of the four reign­ing Grand Slam women’s sin­gles cham­pi­ons. Barty won last year’s French Open, Halep last year’s Wim­ble­don and An­dreescu last year’s US Open.</p>
    <p>Fourth-ranked Amer­i­can Sofia Kenin, the sur­prise winner of this year’s Aus­tralian Open, is the only reign­ing cham­pion in the field.</p>
    <p>But the women’s tour­na­ment is hardly with­out ma­jor star power or sto­ry­lines. Ser­ena Wil­liams, 38, is still aim­ing for a record-ty­ing 24th Ma­jor sin­gles ti­tle at a tour­na­ment where she has had six tri­umphs.</p>
    <p>Ranked ninth, she will be among the top four seeds. Czech Karolina Pliskova will be seeded at No. 1, Kenin at No. 2, Wil­liams at No. 3 and Naomi Osaka of Ja­pan at No. 4.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest hit to the tour­na­ment would be Ser­ena not play­ing,” said Tracy Austin, a two-time US Open cham­pion who is now a</p>
    <p>Ten­nis Chan­nel an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>“With Ser­ena, you still have the big­gest sto­ry­line with her go­ing for 24.”</p>
    <p>Women’s ten­nis is par­tic­u­larly deep and egal­i­tar­ian at the mo­ment. Plenty of other es­tab­lished threats are still in the field, in­clud­ing Czech Pe­tra Kvi­tova.</p>
    <p>There are also new threats like 16-year-old Coco Gauff.</p>
    <p>But there is no ig­nor­ing re­al­ity, ei­ther, and there could be an­other big-name pull-out in Gar­bine Mugu­ruza. The resur­gent Spa­niard and two-time Slam winner, who lost to Kenin in the Mel­bourne fi­nal, on Mon­day tweeted that she would skip the Western & South­ern Open and is in a race to be fit for Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>On the fi­nal warm-up tour­na­ment, which starts to­mor­row, she said: “I have de­cided to with­draw due to dis­com­fort in my left an­kle. I re­ally want to get back on Tour.”</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to 1968, the year when ten­nis first went fully pro­fes­sional, Austin said: “This def­i­nitely has to be the weak­est US Open of the Open era.</p>
    <p>“There might have been some Aus­tralian and French Opens that were not as well at­tended, but that was ob­vi­ously not be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It was be­cause not ev­ery­one was play­ing them at the time. The Halep with­drawal is a par­tic­u­larly tough one. But I think the USTA is do­ing the best they can in a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 19 of the top 100 women have with­drawn, and more at­tri­tion is pos­si­ble in the days ahead with former world No. 1, An­gelique Ker­ber of Ger­many, among the un­de­cided.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of ab­sen­tees have con­cerns about trav­el­ling dur­ing the pan­demic or about man­ag­ing a dense tour­na­ment sched­ule that, after a five-month hia­tus, has packed two Slam tour­na­ments into a six-week pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The French Open is due to start on Sept 27, just two weeks after the end of the US Open and the prospect of chang­ing con­ti­nents and sur­faces quickly has led to some play­ers pri­ori­tis­ing the clay­court circuit.</p>
    <p>The men’s side has cer­tainly taken ma­jor hits as well. Among the ab­sen­tees in­clude world No. 2 and reign­ing cham­pion Rafael Nadal, Gael Mon­fils, Stan Wawrinka, while Roger Fed­erer is out due to in­jury.</p>
    <p>Still, at this stage, only three of the top-10 men and nine of the top 100 are miss­ing from the US Open field. It is un­clear why more of the lead­ing Euro­pean men have de­cided to play in New York than the lead­ing Euro­pean women.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it has any­thing to do with be­ing men or women,” said Sven Groen­eveld, who has coached the former top-ranked women Maria Shara­pova and Ana Ivanovic. “It comes down to per­sonal rea­sons and in­di­vid­ual de­ci­sions.”</p>
