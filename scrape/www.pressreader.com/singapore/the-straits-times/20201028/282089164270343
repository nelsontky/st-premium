    <p>Two more in­di­vid­u­als ad­mit­ted yes­ter­day to be­ing part of a gath­er­ing in June that flouted safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mo­hamad Iman Ab­dul Rahim, 19, and Norsyahmi Norhe­sham, 21, each pleaded guilty to one count of breach­ing rules un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act by meet­ing more than four peo­ple not liv­ing in the same place of res­i­dence as them­selves.</p>
    <p>When sen­tenc­ing each of them at a later date, Deputy Prin­ci­pal District Judge Seah Chi-Ling will take into con­sid­er­a­tion one sim­i­lar charge of flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules and one count of drink­ing in pub­lic be­tween 10.30pm and 7am.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he called for re­ports to as­sess if the duo are suit­able for pro­ba­tion. They are ex­pected to be back in court on Dec 8.</p>
    <p>Iman and Norsyahmi were among a group of 13 that gath­ered il­le­gally un­til the wee hours of June 28 at the fit­ness cor­ner near Block 42 Beo Cres­cent, off Have­lock Road. There were two mi­nors in the group.</p>
    <p>As part of phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic reopen­ing, which took ef­fect on June 19, groups of up to five peo­ple can meet out­side of their homes, such as at restau­rants for meals. They should prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing and avoid mix­ing be­tween dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>The court heard that two mem­bers of the il­le­gal gath­er­ing – Muham­mad Zaki Jo­hari, 33, and Mo­ham­mad Zack Danial Ahamad Zaki, 20 – planned to have al­co­holic drinks on June 27.</p>
    <p>All of them, ex­cept for the two mi­nors, con­sumed al­co­hol at the gath­er­ing, which started at 9pm.</p>
    <p>Norsyahmi Norhe­sham (left) and Mo­hamad Iman Ab­dul Rahim were part of a gath­er­ing in June that flouted safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It was so noisy that a res­i­dent in a nearby flat was kept awake. He alerted the po­lice shortly be­fore 1am. The gath­er­ing ended soon af­ter an of­fi­cer ar­rived.</p>
    <p>Eight peo­ple were dealt with ear­lier for their par­tic­i­pa­tion in the gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Zaki and three oth­ers – Nur Sal­iza Mo­hamed Sani, 23, Nu­rul Sheilla Nata­sya Suhaimi, 25, and Nu­raznie Ith­nin, 31 – were each fined $4,000.</p>
    <p>Zack and Aqlima Ab­dul Azmi, 19, were each fined $3,000.</p>
    <p>Sai Raghu Vaish­navee Ragu, 19, was sen­tenced to a year’s pro­ba­tion, while the youngest mem­ber of the group, a 14-year-old boy, was given a con­di­tional warn­ing.</p>
    <p>The cases for three peo­ple are pend­ing. They are: 20-year-old Remy Shah Hail Mee, a 26-year-old Malaysian man and a 15-year-old boy.</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
