    <p>BEI­JING • A kinder­garten teacher in China has been sen­tenced to death for poi­son­ing dozens of chil­dren in an act of re­venge against a col­league that left one tod­dler dead.</p>
    <p>A court in the cen­tral Chi­nese prov­ince of He­nan said on Mon­day that Wang Yun put sodium ni­trite into por­ridge be­ing pre­pared for her col­league’s pupils, caus­ing 25 of them to fall sick.</p>
    <p>The at­tack, which took place in March last year, left one boy se­verely ill for months be­fore he died in Jan­uary this year, ac­cord­ing to news re­ports.</p>
    <p>The Jiaozuo City Intermedia­te Peo­ple’s Court said Wang knew sodium ni­trite was harm­ful but went ahead “with no re­gard for the con­se­quences”, leav­ing many in­no­cent chil­dren in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>News re­ports last year said the chil­dren be­gan vom­it­ing and faint­ing after eat­ing their break­fast.</p>
    <p>Kinder­garten pupils in China are aged be­tween three and six.</p>
    <p>The death sen­tence was handed to Wang this week for the of­fence of us­ing danger­ous sub­stances.</p>
    <p>Sodium ni­trite is used for cur­ing meats, but can be toxic when in­gested in high amounts.</p>
    <p>Wang con­cealed her rea­sons for the poi­son­ing after car­ry­ing out the crime and her “mo­tives were de­spi­ca­ble”, the court said.</p>
    <p>Her “crim­i­nal meth­ods and cir­cum­stances were ex­ceed­ingly bad, with es­pe­cially se­vere cir­cum­stances, and she should be se­verely pun­ished in ac­cor­dance with the law”, the sen­tenc­ing state­ment from the court said.</p>
    <p>The court added that Wang and the man­ager of the kinder­garten must com­pen­sate the chil­dren’s fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>It was not the first time that Wang had used sodium ni­trite to poi­son some­one, ac­cord­ing to the au­thor­i­ties. In 2017, she put the sub­stance in her hus­band’s mug, caus­ing him mi­nor in­juries.</p>
    <p>In another in­ci­dent in March last year, 36 pri­mary school pupils in south-west China’s Sichuan prov­ince were hos­pi­talised after eat­ing “mouldy food”.</p>
