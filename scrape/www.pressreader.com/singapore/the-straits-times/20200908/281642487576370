    <p>Busi­nesses that en­gage in mis­lead­ing ad­ver­tis­ing prac­tices such as tout­ing prices that omit manda­tory fees, for ex­am­ple, have two months to clean up their act.</p>
    <p>A set of guide­lines that spec­ify pric­ing prac­tices that may break the law will take ef­fect on Nov 1 and ap­ply to all phys­i­cal and on­line sup­pli­ers, the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The price trans­parency guide­lines, an­nounced last year, set out how the CCCS will in­ter­pret and wield the Con­sumer Pro­tec­tion (Fair Trad­ing) Act to stamp out er­rant prac­tices, and spell out ac­tions that busi­nesses should take to en­sure they are not in­fring­ing the law.</p>
    <p>This comes as the CCCS is look­ing at beef­ing up its en­force­ment pow­ers in ad­min­is­ter­ing the Act, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of be­ing able to im­pose fi­nan­cial penal­ties with­out hav­ing to go through the courts.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines cover four ar­eas: Drip pric­ing, which refers to fees added on to the ad­ver­tised price dur­ing the trans­ac­tion process; false or mis­lead­ing price com­par­isons; fake dis­counts; and use of the term “free”.</p>
    <p>The full guide­lines, pub­lished on CCCS’ web­site yes­ter­day, were prompted by a study on the on­line travel book­ing space last year, which found that some con­sumers ended up pay­ing more than they bar­gained for due to opaque pric­ing and mar­ket­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>A check by The Straits Times last Oc­to­ber found that the use of tac­tics flagged by the com­mis­sion, such as drip pric­ing and pres­sure selling, was wide­spread among travel book­ing sites.</p>
    <p>Some have since changed their prac­tices, a check yes­ter­day found.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­dia’s Sin­ga­pore site, for ex­am­ple, now dis­plays a disclaimer that the head­line price ex­cludes taxes and fees.</p>
    <p>Travel book­ing plat­form Agoda, how­ever, ad­ver­tised the same “daily deal” for a Sen­tosa ho­tel room on two sep­a­rate days last week. More­over, the price re­mained the same even af­ter the deal was re­moved yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mous­ing over a crossed-out price implied as the usual price for this ho­tel room brought up a prompt that it was ac­tu­ally the high­est price paid for a book­ing within the last year. Agoda did not re­spond to queries. The CCCS said yes­ter­day that con­sumers who en­counter un­fair prac­tices should ap­proach the Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (Case), adding that it will mon­i­tor the con­duct of sup­pli­ers and take ac­tion against those that per­sist in un­fair trade prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion’s di­rec­tor for con­sumer pro­tec­tion, Mr Jack Teng, said dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that the CCCS takes a bal­anced ap­proach in en­forc­ing the rules, with me­di­a­tion and ne­go­ti­a­tion be­ing the first step.</p>
    <p>He said the watch­dog will look into busi­nesses that per­sist in er­rant prac­tices, adding: “(If) de­spite chances like Case ap­proach­ing you and giv­ing you chances to change and you don’t, then we will take ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>While the Act also ap­plies to overseas-based busi­nesses that sup­ply goods and services to con­sumers in Sin­ga­pore, cross-bor­der en­force­ment re­mains a chal­lenge for reg­u­la­tors world­wide, Mr Teng noted.</p>
    <p>“In this as­pect, con­sumer ed­u­ca­tion is very cru­cial. So, con­sumers must make in­formed choices and if some­thing seems too good to be true, please think twice be­fore trans­act­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan, pres­i­dent of Case, said it re­ceived at least 246 com­plaints al­leg­ing un­fair prac­tices high­lighted in the guide­lines be­tween 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>When such com­plaints are re­ceived in the fu­ture, Case will point busi­nesses to the guide­lines and re­mind them of their obli­ga­tions, he said. Re­cal­ci­trant firms will con­tinue to be re­ferred to the CCCS for in­ves­ti­ga­tion and en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Dav­ina Wong, CCCS’ se­nior as­sis­tant di­rec­tor for con­sumer pro­tec­tion, noted that build­ing trust with con­sumers will help busi­nesses in the long run, par­tic­u­larly dur­ing the cur­rent eco­nomic cli­mate, when con­sumers may be more cau­tious in how they spend their money.</p>
