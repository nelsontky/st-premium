    <p>The na­tional ef­fort to vac­ci­nate the pop­u­la­tion will re­quire con­sid­er­able re­sources and will be one of Sin­ga­pore’s key fo­cus ar­eas this year, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong, as he fleshed out the coun­try’s vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy yes­ter­day. “Vac­ci­na­tions will be a key en­abler al­low­ing us to re­turn to nor­malcy,” Mr Gan told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The na­tional ef­fort to vac­ci­nate the pop­u­la­tion will re­quire con­sid­er­able re­sources and will be one of Sin­ga­pore’s key fo­cus ar­eas this year, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong as he fleshed out the coun­try’s vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Vac­ci­na­tions will be a key en­abler al­low­ing us to re­turn to nor­malcy,” he told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day. He said this is a new line of de­fence that Sin­ga­pore must put in place while the global sit­u­a­tion re­mains volatile, and it in­volves a mas­sive lo­gis­ti­cal ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>“We have se­cured enough vac­cines for the whole pop­u­la­tion. Ev­ery vac­cine ap­proved for use will meet all our safety and ef­fi­cacy re­quire­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing some de­tails of the pro­gramme, Mr Gan said peo­ple will need to make a book­ing be­fore vis­it­ing vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres for the Covid-19 shot, and will not get to choose the vac­cine they want.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­nated in­di­vid­u­als will get a phys­i­cal card, but can also check their vac­ci­na­tion sta­tus on­line.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the first ship­ment of the Pfizer-BioN­Tech Covid-19 vac­cine last month, Mr Gan said, more vac­cines are ex­pected to ar­rive here in the next few months, in­clud­ing those by United States firm Moderna and China’s Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>“If all goes ac­cord­ing to sched­ule, we will have enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one by the third quar­ter of this year,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers and other Covid-19 front-line staff will be first in line for the vac­cine, fol­lowed by the el­derly, those at greater risk of se­vere dis­ease, and those in jobs or set­tings where risk of a su­per-spread­ing event is high, in­clud­ing mi­grant work­ers. Vac­ci­na­tions will then be pro­gres­sively broad­ened to in­clude other Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan urged peo­ple to get vac­ci­nated, though vac­ci­na­tion is vol­un­tary. “This will not only pro­tect your­self, but also in­di­rectly pro­tect oth­ers who can­not be vac­ci­nated due to med­i­cal rea­sons. This col­lec­tive pro­tec­tion will be more ef­fec­tive the more peo­ple are vac­ci­nated.”</p>
    <p>To en­sure vac­cine ac­cess, Mr Gan said Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion will be free for all Sin­ga­pore­ans, per­ma­nent res­i­dents and long-term res­i­dents – about 5.7 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>He urged peo­ple not to daw­dle: “The best time to vac­ci­nate is now. If peo­ple wait un­til an out­break has hap­pened to get them­selves vac­ci­nated, it will be too late, both to pro­tect them­selves and to pre­vent the out­break in the first place.”</p>
    <p>He stressed that the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity will al­low a Covid-19 vac­cine to be used only if it is as­sessed to be suf­fi­ciently ef­fi­ca­cious and safe for use, and only if the ben­e­fits are as­sessed to out­weigh the risks of any po­ten­tial ad­verse ef­fects from the vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther give peo­ple peace of mind, the Health Min­istry will also in­tro­duce a vac­cine in­jury fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance pro­gramme to pro­vide sup­port for peo­ple who suf­fer se­ri­ous side ef­fects re­lated to Covid-19 vac­cines ad­min­is­tered here.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to 14 MPs who raised ques­tions on Sin­ga­pore’s vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy, Mr Gan and Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19, said that vac­ci­na­tion is not a sil­ver bul­let for tack­ling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, while the Govern­ment may con­sider re­lax­ing some rules for those vac­ci­nated – such as do­ing away with test­ing be­fore events or chang­ing quar­an­tine rules for re­turn­ing trav­ellers – ex­ist­ing rules will still ap­ply un­til more data is avail­able, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“So un­til we un­der­stand the ef­fects of the vac­cine, I think we will not be able to make any changes to our mea­sures, be it do­mes­tic or travel mea­sures,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, like the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the United States, will only ap­prove Covid-19 vac­cines that are at least 50 per cent ef­fec­tive, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing yes­ter­day to Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC), who had asked if the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) has any thresh­old for ef­fi­cacy be­fore it ap­proves any vac­cine.</p>
    <p>At the same time, other cri­te­ria must also be con­sid­ered be­fore ap­prov­ing a vac­cine in a cri­sis sit­u­a­tion like the pan­demic, Mr Gan noted.</p>
    <p>HSA’s ex­perts will weigh the ben­e­fits and risks, and con­duct a holis­tic as­sess­ment be­fore con­clud­ing whether a vac­cine will be ap­proved for use, he added.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes fac­tors such as the po­ten­tial risk of ad­verse in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>“So it is not a clear-cut thresh­old that once (the ef­fi­cacy) is 50.1 per cent, we will ap­prove it. If there is greater un­cer­tainty, then we will re­quire a higher level of ef­fi­cacy for us to be as­sured of the ben­e­fits ver­sus the risks,” Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>Also, the sever­ity of the health cri­sis will have to be taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>A lower thresh­old of ef­fi­cacy may be ac­cepted in the event of a very se­vere pan­demic that re­quires the pop­u­la­tion to be vac­ci­nated as quickly as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioN­Tech – the first one to be ap­proved here – has demon­strated an ef­fi­cacy rate of 95 per cent in clin­i­cal tri­als on more than 40,000 par­tic­i­pants aged be­tween 16 and 91 years old.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim noted that HSA’s ap­proval for the Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine is an in­terim au­tho­ri­sa­tion, and asked what ad­di­tional in­for­ma­tion will need to be sub­mit­ted in or­der for the vac­cine to re­ceive full reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Gan said the au­thor­i­ties will have to mon­i­tor how the vac­cine is ad­min­is­tered in real life, given that it has been rolled out for only a cou­ple of months.</p>
    <p>The man­u­fac­tur­ers are also re­quired to re­port any ad­verse in­ci­dents that hap­pen so that Sin­ga­pore can keep track of the vac­cine’s per­for­mance on the ground, as well as the po­ten­tial risks that it may carry.</p>
    <p>“We need to do this con­tin­u­ously for a pro­longed pe­riod of time, usu­ally one year, two years or maybe longer, so as to give us the as­sur­ance of the long-term ef­fect of this vac­cine,” said Mr Gan, adding that this is partly why HSA has not yet given full au­tho­ri­sa­tion to the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>A full au­tho­ri­sa­tion will re­quire long-term data to be avail­able.</p>
    <p>“But in view of the pan­demic that we are fac­ing to­day, HSA has given the in­terim ap­proval for the use of this vac­cine, ac­cept­ing the fact that long-term data will only be avail­able in the long term,” said Mr Gan.</p>
