    <p>BERLIN • Neg­li­gence is be­hind Ger­many’s steady rise i n new coro­n­avirus cases, the head of a state-funded re­search body said yes­ter­day, adding it was un­clear if a sec­ond wave was un­der way.</p>
    <p>“The new de­vel­op­ments in Ger­many make me very wor­ried,” Dr Lothar Wieler, of the Robert Koch In­sti­tute (RKI) for in­fec­tious diseases, said dur­ing his first news con­fer­ence in weeks.</p>
    <p>“The rise has to do with the fact that we have be­come neg­li­gent,” he added, urg­ing peo­ple not to flout so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily new cases al­most dou­bled yes­ter­day to 633, and the RKI, which is Ger­many’s most closely fol­lowed com­piler of Covid-19 data, linked that to in­creased con­tact at par­ties and the work­place.</p>
    <p>With more than 206,000 con­firmed cases and just over 9,000 deaths, Ger­many wants to avoid a sec­ond wave, which would bring back lock­downs af­ter eco­nom­i­cally crip­pling re­stric­tions closed many busi­nesses for six weeks in March and April.</p>
    <p>Europe’s big­gest econ­omy with­stood the pan­demic with far fewer deaths than some of its l arge neigh­bours, such as France and Italy, ow­ing to wide­spread test­ing, a well-equipped health­care sys­tem and good ad­her­ence to so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the sum­mer hol­i­day sea­son has prompted fears that tourists re­turn­ing from des­ti­na­tions ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a surge in new cases, such as Spain, could sow the seeds of a sec­ond wave. But Dr Wieler down­played that.</p>
    <p>“It is ir­rel­e­vant if you are on hol­i­day or at home,” he said. “The hol­i­day is as much a part of the pre­cau­tions against the spread of Covid-19 as your work and home life. The set­ting is ir­rel­e­vant.”</p>
    <p>The port city of Ham­burg is weigh­ing a ban on sell­ing al­co­hol in its red light dis­trict af­ter rev­ellers ig­nored so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules at the week­end.</p>
