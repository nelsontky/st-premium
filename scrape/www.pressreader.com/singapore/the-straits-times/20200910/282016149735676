    <p>For some time now, univer­sity lead­ers, and ed­u­ca­tors in gen­eral, have had our eye on is­sues such as the rapid pace of tech­no­log­i­cal change and its im­pli­ca­tions for what and how we teach, and what and how stu­dents learn – the op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges aris­ing from In­dus­try 4.0, in other words.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, we had to grap­ple with de­glob­al­i­sa­tion and ris­ing geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions, and what such trends might mean for how uni­ver­si­ties con­duct re­search, re­cruit stu­dents and at­tract tal­ent. Then Covid-19 hap­pened.</p>
    <p>What we de­fined as ma­jor chal­lenges of the day had to be jux­ta­posed against the ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion, as the pan­demic has been de­scribed.</p>
    <p>And one of the things an ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis does is that it makes us pon­der un­com­fort­able and pro­found ex­is­ten­tial ques­tions.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the “what” and “how” ques­tions, we now have to also ask “why?”. Why do we teach what we teach? And why do we teach the way we do?</p>
    <p>As pres­i­dent of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), my job isn’t sim­ply to pre­pare my stu­dents for a world of work, but also for life out­side the univer­sity’s gates.</p>
    <p>Now, in this Covid-19 “new nor­mal”, there is even greater ur­gency to not only help my grad­u­ates find jobs, but also to make sense of all these con­fus­ing changes oc­cur­ring in our midst.</p>
    <p>In or­der to ac­com­plish all of that, NUS must rad­i­cally trans­form it­self. Steady and in­cre­men­tal change is a lux­ury we can no longer af­ford.</p>
    <p>THE PAST: SPE­CIAL­I­SA­TION</p>
    <p>For the long­est time, grad­u­ates could spe­cialise, find spe­cialised work that matched their train­ing and re­main in their cho­sen in­dus­tries over their ca­reers. If they had to move, it would be to ad­ja­cent in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>At the same time, uni­ver­si­ties largely fo­cused on pre-em­ploy­ment train­ing – the last stop on the ed­u­ca­tion jour­ney be­fore en­ter­ing the work­ing world.</p>
    <p>These as­sump­tions no longer hold.</p>
    <p>Our young adults will grad­u­ate into a world of “wicked prob­lems”, prob­lems that are ill-de­fined, mu­tate all the time, defy sin­gle-dis­ci­pline so­lu­tions and even chal­lenge es­tab­lished bod­ies of knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 it­self is an ex­am­ple of that: It is more than a med­i­cal is­sue, with a broader im­pact on so­ci­ety, pol­i­tics, the econ­omy and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>To even try to un­der­stand it, much less solve it, re­quires in­te­grat­ing knowl­edge, skills and in­sights from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>These are the types of prob­lems that our grad­u­ates will have to con­front and deal with. Thus, we need to broaden the in­tel­lec­tual foun­da­tions of our stu­dents’ learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Our tra­di­tional ap­proach pri­ori­tised depth of knowl­edge. We now must bal­ance depth with breadth. Dis­ci­plinary rigour is still nec­es­sary, but will not be enough. And we will need to re­think what we mean by “rigour”.</p>
    <p>We need to cul­ti­vate in our stu­dents the abil­ity to syn­the­sise knowl­edge from across dif­fer­ent fields. The key to this is to broaden the cur­ricu­lum and in­crease in­ter­dis­ci­plinar­ity in our cur­ric­ula.</p>
    <p>But just hav­ing the breadth re­quire­ments is in­suf­fi­cient; the point is to in­te­grate these dis­parate el­e­ments into a co­her­ent com­mon cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>As a life­long aca­demic and ed­u­ca­tor, used to teach­ing by sub­ject si­los and man­ag­ing col­leagues grouped by their aca­demic fields, I ac­knowl­edge that such an in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary ap­proach will be dif­fi­cult to ac­com­plish. But I strongly be­lieve that this turn to­wards in­ter­dis­ci­plinar­ity is the way to go.</p>
    <p>There will be mis­giv­ings and re­sis­tance. Es­pe­cially in Sin­ga­pore, but also in many other places, we tend to prize the spe­cial­ist over the gen­er­al­ist. Our ki­a­su­ism also means we of­ten “over-teach”.</p>
    <p>AN IN­TER­DIS­CI­PLI­NARY WORLD</p>
    <p>What does this mean for NUS?</p>
    <p>We will have to shift the stu­dent work­load. For a start, we will ease the ex­ces­sive re­quire­ments for sub­ject ma­jors so that we can add breadth to the cur­ricu­lum over­all.</p>
    <p>If we want our stu­dents to be able to con­nect the dots in new and un­usual ways, it helps to broaden their hori­zons and ex­pose them to more dots.</p>
    <p>This is not merely a quan­ti­ta­tive change, but a qual­i­ta­tive one. In or­der that our grad­u­ates be ag­ile, adapt­able and ef­fec­tive prob­lem-solvers, we will move more to­wards prob­lem-based ped­a­gogy and ex­pe­ri­en­tial learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Life­long learn­ing will also be a defin­ing char­ac­ter­is­tic of univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The rapid pace of change means that the half-life of knowl­edge is de­creas­ing quickly. The long-held as­sump­tion that spend­ing three to four years in one’s early 20s in univer­sity would suf­fice and set one up for life, with the oc­ca­sional up­grade, has also failed.</p>
    <p>Your “univer­sity years” are no longer those few years but could span 20 years or more of con­tin­u­ous learn­ing.</p>
    <p>In fact, as we turn more and more to­wards on­line learn­ing, your “univer­sity years” may not nec­es­sar­ily be spent at univer­sity. Learn­ing will take place ev­ery­where. The univer­sity will be ev­ery­where you go.</p>
    <p>Some stu­dents may feel a deep sense of dis­com­fort at learn­ing things out of their com­fort zone. Cer­tainly, their ex­pec­ta­tions of univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion will be up­ended.</p>
    <p>Well, growth is dis­com­fit­ing, and those pangs are a small price to pay if that dis­com­fi­ture can stim­u­late and in­spire minds in novel and un­ex­pected ways.</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand that some stu­dents and par­ents may see these changes in our ed­u­ca­tional frame­work as di­lut­ing ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>Some who are set on a ca­reer in medicine or math­e­mat­ics may ques­tion why they need to be ex­posed to, say, an­thro­pol­ogy. Oth­ers may worry that core skills are be­ing di­luted and aca­demic stan­dards low­ered.</p>
    <p>But I think these fears are un­founded. This is not about mak­ing trade-offs be­tween spe­cial­i­sa­tion and gen­er­al­i­sa­tion, but in­ject­ing greater flex­i­bil­ity into our cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve our com­mu­nity can and must ac­com­mo­date a di­ver­sity of pro­cliv­i­ties: those who in­cline to­wards ex­per­tise in a sin­gle dis­ci­pline, the in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary ex­pert who can solve prob­lems that strad­dle two or three dis­ci­plines, and the ef­fec­tive prob­lem-solver who can see con­nec­tions and gaps across dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>Through these changes, which we will be mak­ing in the months ahead, we hope that our grad­u­ates will learn to frame and man­age wicked prob­lems; be cu­ri­ous and alert to op­por­tu­ni­ties be­yond their ar­eas of ex­per­tise; and pick up the knack of ex­plor­ing and chart­ing their own aca­demic jour­ney through life­long learn­ing – in class, at home, at work and at play.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SORS TOO NEED TO CHANGE</p>
    <p>What holds true for changes in store for our learn­ers also holds true for pro­fes­sors.</p>
    <p>If our pro­fes­sors are to pro­vide range, they too must em­brace range – for bet­ter learn­ing and bet­ter re­search. Stud­ies show that more di­verse teams of ex­perts pro­duce more im­pact­ful re­search.</p>
    <p>This may be an even big­ger chal­lenge than changes in ed­u­ca­tion. Uni­ver­si­ties are or­gan­ised along dis­ci­plinary fief­dom-like lines. The aca­demic en­ter­prise tra­di­tion­ally re­wards depth and spe­cial­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This way of or­gan­i­sa­tion is in­ad­e­quate for a world whose prob­lems do not re­spect such dis­ci­plinary bound­aries. If the univer­sity does not adapt and change, it will get left be­hind, at best. At worst, it be­comes ex­tinct.</p>
    <p>Many a univer­sity leader has tried and failed to get re­searchers to em­brace range and in­ter­dis­ci­plinar­ity. Covid-19, how­ever, demon­strates the value of em­brac­ing dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines to solve a prob­lem at once global and lo­cal, epi­demi­o­log­i­cal and so­ci­etal.</p>
    <p>My col­leagues have tapped our strengths in engi­neer­ing and medicine to de­velop test kits and vac­cines; in pub­lic health to set guide­lines on mask-wear­ing, per­sonal hy­giene and safe dis­tanc­ing – even through car­toons – and in so­cial work and busi­ness to ad­dress men­tal health or im­prov­ing food de­liv­ery ser­vices dur­ing the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Longer-term re­sponses on food se­cu­rity and eco­nomic re­silience will sim­i­larly re­quire such depth and breadth.</p>
    <p>As we chart our way in a world of per­sist­ing and even in­creas­ing dis­or­der, we find that agility is in­dis­pens­able for in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“Agility” sounds like yet an­other man­age­ment fad, but it is not.</p>
    <p>In an es­say ti­tled The Hedge­hog And The Fox, Bri­tish philoso­pher Isa­iah Ber­lin ar­gues there are two types of thinkers: hedge­hogs, who know that one big thing; and foxes, who draw on a mix of ideas and ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>In fact, you could go back even fur­ther to the an­cient Greek poet Archilochu­s, who said: “A fox knows many things, but a hedge­hog one im­por­tant thing.”</p>
    <p>So­ci­eties will need both the hedge­hog and its deep ex­per­tise as well as the fox and its agility and ver­sa­til­ity. Here at NUS, we in­tend to pro­duce grad­u­ates who pos­sess qual­i­ties of both groups.</p>
