    <p>The pan­demic has not damp­ened on­line ac­tiv­ity around this year’s Na­tional Day, with re­lated tweets in­creas­ing 2½ times com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. The Straits Times worked with re­search firm Quilt.AI to an­a­lyse more than 6,000 tweets over the same two-week pe­riod be­fore Na­tional Day this year and last.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has not damp­ened on­line ac­tiv­ity sur­round­ing this year’s Na­tional Day, with re­lated tweets on Twit­ter in­creas­ing 2½ times when com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Notably, more peo­ple this year em­pha­sised com­mu­nity and the ev­ery­day in a more “au­then­tic and peo­ple-ori­ented” ex­pres­sion of joy, a sig­nif­i­cant de­par­ture from last year, when the bulk of posts cen­tred around the main event at the Padang on the evening of Aug 9.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times worked with Quilt.AI, an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-pow­ered re­search com­pany, to an­a­lyse more than 6,000 tweets – with bots and retweets ex­cluded – over the same two-week pe­riod be­fore Na­tional Day this year and last.</p>
    <p>The cap­tions and im­ages of 400 Na­tional Day-spe­cific In­sta­gram posts in each year were also looked at, but a sim­i­lar anal­y­sis of Facebook posts could not be done, as it goes against the plat­form’s terms of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Posts were iden­ti­fied by Na­tional Day-re­lated hash­tags and key­words such as “fun­pack” and “pa­rade”. The re­sults showed that “NDP 2020 has cre­ated a nar­ra­tive of its own”, said Quilt.AI, re­fer­ring to the Na­tional Day Pa­rade.</p>
    <p>While about 40 per cent of tweets last year were char­ac­terised as “cel­e­brat­ing spec­ta­cle” – with the posts in­clud­ing words like “singing”, “con­cert” and “ex­hi­bi­tion” – these had halved to just 20 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>In­stead, a new cat­e­gory of tweets on “cel­e­brat­ing home” emerged, with con­cepts like “baked goods”, “cui­sine” and “home record­ings”, in line with this year’s more heart­land-based cel­e­bra­tions. These in­creased from 1 per cent of re­lated tweets last year to 16 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>An­thro­pol­o­gist An­gad Chowdhry, co-founder of Quilt.AI, said: “It seems there is a shift from the need for spec­ta­cle to the cel­e­bra­tion of com­mon hu­man­ity this year. This au­then­tic­ity is an out­come of a reimag­i­na­tion of what is im­por­tant in life (af­ter) the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Quilt.AI said Na­tional Day tweets about do­ing good deeds in­creased by 16 per cent from last year.</p>
    <p>A 230 per cent in­crease in tweets about “re­cov­ery” also put this year’s cel­e­bra­tions in con­text, hint­ing at peo­ple’s hopes of re­cov­er­ing from the ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>There was also an in­crease in ref­er­ences to race and cli­mate. Dr Chowdhry noted: “The so­cio-po­lit­i­cal com­men­tary is in­creas­ing, but neg­a­tiv­ity is not, sug­gest­ing that a de­sire for con­struc­tive en­gage­ment with civil so­ci­ety is on the rise.”</p>
    <p>The study found that on In­sta­gram, the top emo­tion in Na­tional Day posts this year was “af­fec­tion”, in con­trast to “ex­cite­ment” last year – a softer emo­tion that fit the pat­tern of the more “low-key” ex­pres­sions of joy on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal man­age­ment con­sul­tant Ryan Lim from QED said sen­ti­ment re­search needs to take into ac­count plat­forms such as What­sApp and TikTok, as they are used by dif­fer­ent de­mo­graphic groups.</p>
    <p>Dr Chowdhry said: “There is a po­ten­tial of on­line pos­i­tiv­ity to have knock-on ef­fects on how peo­ple en­gage with each other in real life. There is data that shows how neg­a­tiv­ity on­line im­pacts ev­ery­day life. It stands to rea­son that pos­i­tiv­ity does, too.”</p>
