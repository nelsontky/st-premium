        - <span role="byline">IAN ANG AND ALARIC CHOO, CO-FOUNDERS OF SECRETLAB Goh Yan Han</span>
    </section>

    <p>An idea hatched in his bed­room has helped en­tre­pre­neur Ian Ang build a mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar busi­ness – and all be­fore he turns 30.</p>
    <p>His win­ning no­tion stemmed from the frus­tra­tion of be­ing un­able to find suit­able gam­ing chairs. His re­sponse? Make them him­self.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang, 28, and busi­ness part­ner and friend Alaric Choo, 32, founded Secretlab and toiled over the past five years to con­tin­u­ally im­prove their prod­uct, which is now among the most highly rated gam­ing chairs in the world.</p>
    <p>Secretlab de­liv­ers chairs to more than 60 coun­tries and deals di­rectly with con­sumers, with op­er­a­tions al­most en­tirely on­line.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has ex­panded to nearly 200 staff from just two.</p>
    <p>The duo are not slow­ing down. While tight-lipped on their plans, they in­tend to con­tinue ex­pand­ing, es­pe­cially with the mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore get­ting more sat­u­rated as Secretlab chairs be­come more</p>
    <p>main­stream, said Mr Ang.</p>
    <p>Secretlab was unique when it started, as the gam­ing chair in­dus­try was not yet es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>“There were no text­book an­swers or any­body to re­fer to out there,” said Mr Ang. “We have al­ways had to take a very creative ap­proach to ev­ery­thing that we do.”</p>
    <p>He has some ad­vice for bud­ding en­trepreneur­s: “One needs grit – not in the sense of aban­don­ing the busi­ness or what­not, but in the daily, dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of tak­ing the easy way out, you have to stress your­self out: Think and think and think, con­stantly weigh all the pros and cons, think cre­atively of 10 other pos­si­ble al­ter­na­tives, then make the best call.</p>
    <p>“It can be men­tally tax­ing and un­healthy.”</p>
