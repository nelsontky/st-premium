    <p>• Ar­gentina foot­ball le­gend Diego Maradona was suf­fer­ing from liver, kid­ney and car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­or­ders but there were no signs of al­co­hol or nar­cotics con­sump­tion in his au­topsy, the pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The World Cup-win­ning cap­tain from Mex­ico 1986 died of a heart at­tack on Nov 25 at the age of 60.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor in San Isidro, a north­ern sub­urb of the cap­i­tal Buenos Aires, pub­lished the re­sults of Maradona’s au­topsy late on Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>It was or­dered as part of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into his death to see if there was any neg­li­gence or reck­less­ness in the health­care he was pro­vided. At the end of his life he was suf­fer­ing from a va­ri­ety of ill­nesses in­clud­ing liver cir­rho­sis, heart dis­ease and kid­ney fail­ure.</p>
    <p>He had also bat­tled co­caine and al­co­hol addictions.</p>
    <p>“What’s come out of the lab­o­ra­tory anal­y­sis is as im­por­tant as what hasn’t, which sim­ply con­firms that Maradona was given psy­chotropic drugs but no medicine for heart dis­ease,” one of the in­ves­ti­ga­tors told the Te­lam press agency.</p>
    <p>Psy­chi­a­trist Agustina Cosa­chov and heart sur­geon Leopoldo Luque are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion as they were treat­ing him be­fore his death.</p>
    <p>A first au­topsy con­ducted the day Maradona died found he had suf­fered from liq­uid in the lungs, with acute heart fail­ure brought on by a dis­ease of the heart mus­cles that makes it harder to pump blood. His heart was twice the nor­mal weight.</p>
    <p>He had also un­der­gone an op­er­a­tion for bleed­ing in the brain on Nov 3, just four days af­ter his 60th birth­day.</p>
    <p>A j udge l ast week ruled that Maradona’s body can­not be cre­mated but con­served in case DNA is needed at a later date for use in pa­ter­nity suits or other cases.</p>
