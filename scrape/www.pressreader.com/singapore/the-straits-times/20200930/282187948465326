    <p>Unit hold­ers of Cap­i­tal and Mall Trust (CMT) and Cap­i­tal and Com­mer­cial Trust (CCT) voted “re­sound­ingly” yesterday in favour of the pro­posed merger to form a new real es­tate in­vest­ment trust (Reit).</p>
    <p>While both sets of in­vestors were in favour of the move, CCT unit hold­ers had lower per­cent­age ap­provals than those from CMT.</p>
    <p>The man­agers said more than 3,000 unit hold­ers voted by proxy at CMT’s extraordin­ary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) and CCT’s EGM and trust scheme meet­ing.</p>
    <p>All five res­o­lu­tions at the three meet­ings were passed and well sup­ported.</p>
    <p>At CMT’s EGM, 98.89 per cent of the votes were in favour of the pro­posed merger by way of the trust scheme, while 98.88 per cent backed the is­suance of new CMT units as part of the scheme con­sid­er­a­tion for the merger.</p>
    <p>Pyra­mex In­vest­ments, Al­bert Com­plex, Premier Healthcare Ser­vices In­ter­na­tional, CMT Man­age­ment and their as­so­ciates ab­stained from vot­ing.</p>
    <p>The man­agers said that for “pur­poses of good cor­po­rate gov­er­nance”, Cap­i­tal and ex­ec­u­tives Ja­son Leow and Jonathan Yap also ab­stained from vot­ing, given their po­si­tions in the groups.</p>
    <p>At CCT’s trust scheme meet­ing, the res­o­lu­tion on the merger by way of the trust scheme re­ceived 90.31 per cent ap­proval by head­count, rep­re­sent­ing 98.23 per cent in value of the to­tal num­ber of CCT units held by unit hold­ers who voted.</p>
    <p>The CCT man­ager, the CMT man­ager’s con­cert par­ties as well as the com­mon sub­stan­tial unit hold­ers of CMT and CCT ab­stained from vot­ing. Un­der the trust scheme, CMT will ac­quire all the units in CCT held by CCT unit hold­ers in ex­change for a com­bi­na­tion of new units in CMT and cash. The con­sid­er­a­tion for each CCT unit un­der the trust scheme com­prises 0.72 new CMT units and $0.259 in cash.</p>
    <p>The merged en­tity is ex­pected to be one of the largest Reits in the Asia-Pa­cific and the largest in Sin­ga­pore by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion ($12.7 bil­lion) and to­tal port­fo­lio prop­erty value ($22.4 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal and In­te­grated Com­mer­cial Trust, as it will be called, will have a di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio of 24 strate­gi­cally lo­cated and high-qual­ity re­tail, of­fice and in­te­grated de­vel­op­ments in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas, said the man­agers.</p>
    <p>The merger is ex­pected to be­come ef­fec­tive on Oct 21. CCT’s last day of trad­ing is ex­pected to be on Oct 16.</p>
