    <p>A 54-year-old woman was hit by a dou­ble-decker SBS Tran­sit bus and pinned un­der its right rear wheel on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent hap­pened at the junc­tion of Be­dok Reser­voir Road and Be­dok North Road at about 12.50pm.</p>
    <p>In a video posted yes­ter­day on Face­book page Roads.sg, the bus can be seen mak­ing a right turn as the woman is walk­ing on the pedes­trian cross­ing.</p>
    <p>She is about mid­way through the cross­ing when the bus hits her.</p>
    <p>In the video, a man who ap­pears to be the bus driver can be seen rush­ing to the woman’s side.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said that the woman was con­scious when she was taken to Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal and that in­ves­ti­ga­tions are un­der way.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, an SBS Tran­sit spokesman said that the com­pany is in touch with the pedes­trian’s next of kin and as­sist­ing the po­lice in their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are sorry that this has hap­pened and are com­mit­ted to ren­der­ing our as­sis­tance as she re­cov­ers... We would also like to apol­o­gise to af­fected com­muters and motorists who were in­con­ve­nienced on Mon­day af­ter­noon due to the ac­ci­dent,” added Ms Tammy Tan, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions at SBS Tran­sit.</p>
