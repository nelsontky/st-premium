    <p>Pricier food due to sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions off­set a plunge in the cost of ser­vices to help keep core in­fla­tion un­changed last month. Core in­fla­tion came in at mi­nus 0.2 per cent, the fifth straight month in neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Pricier food due to sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions off­set a plunge in the cost of ser­vices to help keep core in­fla­tion un­changed last month.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion – it ex­cludes ac­com­mo­da­tion and pri­vate road trans­port costs – came in at mi­nus 0.2 per cent, the same as May and the fifth straight month in neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Over­all in­fla­tion eased to mi­nus 0.5 per cent last month, from mi­nus 0.8 per cent in May, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) and the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng econ­o­mists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye said it is still not clear if in­fla­tion has bot­tomed out.</p>
    <p>“Travel and ho­tel rates will likely show a larger-than-av­er­age drop, given strict bor­der con­trols and the col­lapse in tourism. Promotiona­l auto dis­counts might show up (with) lower car prices in July,” they noted.</p>
    <p>“Wage cuts, job losses and bor­der re­stric­tions will likely keep ser­vices in­fla­tion in neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory in the third quar­ter.”</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling also does not expect in­fla­tion to be pos­i­tive be­fore the end of the year, say­ing: “En­ergy prices re­main con­tained and the soft­en­ing do­mes­tic labour mar­ket is likely to weigh on pri­vate con­sump­tion.”</p>
    <p>Pri­vate trans­port costs fell 4.4 per cent last month, against the 6.8 per cent drop in May, due to smaller de­clines in car and petrol prices.</p>
    <p>The cost of re­tail and other goods also recorded a smaller de­cline – neg­a­tive 1.8 per cent last month com­pared with mi­nus 2.3 per cent in May.</p>
    <p>The cost of elec­tric­ity and gas fell at a slower rate, as well as the takeup of new sub­scrip­tions un­der the Open Elec­tric­ity Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But food in­fla­tion edged up, hit­ting 2.3 per cent last month from May’s 2.2 per cent due to a larger in­crease in the prices of non-cooked items.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling said: “A big driver of food in­fla­tion was the global sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions due to travel re­stric­tions glob­ally and the stalling of the air­line in­dus­try – no pas­sen­ger flights also hit cargo ship­ments.</p>
    <p>“With the grad­ual re­open­ing of many economies and the cau­tious re­sump­tion of flights, the sit­u­a­tion should steadily im­prove, al­though so­cial dis­tanc­ing and hy­giene mea­sures could l evy a higher cost (though this is not lim­ited to the food in­dus­try per se).”</p>
    <p>Ac­com­mo­da­tion in­fla­tion was un­changed as hous­ing rents in­creased at a steady pace.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ser­vices costs fell more sharply – mi­nus 1 per cent last month, from mi­nus 0.8 per cent in May – due to larger de­clines in hol­i­day ex­penses and air­fares.</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI noted that ex­ter­nal sources of in­fla­tion are likely to re­main be­nign in the months ahead amid weak global de­mand. Oil prices should also stay low for an ex­tended pe­riod, which in turn will weigh on the prices of en­ergy-re­lated com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>The sub­dued econ­omy and weak labour mar­ket here will dampen con­sumer de­mand, they added.</p>
    <p>Both core and over­all in­fla­tion are fore­cast to av­er­age be­tween mi­nus 1 and 0 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said that the mix of fall­ing do­mes­tic and tourism-led de­mand, as well as low oil prices for the rest of 2020, will form “for­mi­da­ble head­winds against con­sumer prices”.</p>
    <p>He added that anec­do­tal ev­i­dence point­ing to a resur­gence in Covid-19 in some of Sin­ga­pore’s key trad­ing part­ners and the tight­en­ing of so­cial re­stric­tions in some parts of Asia could also sug­gest that any re­turn of in­bound tourism may not hap­pen for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Food in&#xAD;fla&#xAD;tion hit 2.3 per cent last month, from May&#x2019;s 2.2 per cent, due to a larger in&#xAD;crease in the prices of non-cooked items . One an&#xAD;a&#xAD;lyst said this was driven by global sup&#xAD;ply chain dis&#xAD;rup&#xAD;tions due to travel curbs world&#xAD;wide and the stalling of the air&#xAD;line sec&#xAD;tor.</p>
