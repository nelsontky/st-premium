    <p>With greater di­ver­sity in Par­lia­ment, sharper ques­tion­ing and more ro­bust ex­changes will be par for the course, said Leader of the House In­dra­nee Ra­jah.</p>
    <p>Some of that has al­ready been borne out in the past week, she told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view yes­ter­day, with MPs seek­ing more clarificat­ions on speeches.</p>
    <p>Sum­ming up the five-day de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, which saw 31 new MPs mak­ing their maiden speeches, she said new MPs on both sides of the House put up a “good show­ing”, which au­gurs well for the 14th Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>While she had ear­lier warned against greater po­lar­i­sa­tion in the House, Ms In­dra­nee said MPs had, by and large, kept to the spirit of con­struc­tive dis­course.</p>
    <p>“Many of the ideas and sug­ges­tions were within a broad cen­tral main­stream range. You had some out­liers on both sides, but noth­ing so ex­treme that you could say it was pulling so­ci­ety apart,” she added.</p>
    <p>That said, she noted that there had been points where MPs or min­is­ters had to sound cau­tion­ary notes against cer­tain lines of ar­gu­ments or points made that could have con­se­quences down the line.</p>
    <p>On the prospect of more ro­bust de­bate, she said: “What I hope will hap­pen is that ev­ery­one gets bet­ter at it, in terms of time man­age­ment, and in terms of re­ally be­ing able to crys­tallise the is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee, who is Se­cond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, ex­pects sharper ques­tion­ing on spe­cific Bills and poli­cies in the months ahead when the po­lit­i­cal par­ties dis­agree.</p>
    <p>“But dif­fer­ence is okay, di­ver­sity is okay, pro­vided that you up­hold the dig­nity of the House,” she said.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tive dis­course can be achieved in the House, she said, as long as all MPs re­mem­ber to put the well-be­ing of Sin­ga­pore­ans and Sin­ga­pore as their fore­most pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>“I think if you keep that as your firm fo­cus, then you can agree to dis­agree. You can have im­pas­sioned de­bates, but it is not, and should not be, per­sonal,” she added.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the Gov­ern­ment giv­ing its in-prin­ci­ple agree­ment to live-stream par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings, she said that while it still holds reser­va­tions about the move, it is also cog­nisant of peo­ple’s ap­petite for get­ting in­for­ma­tion speed­ily in to­day’s tech­no­log­i­cal age.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties will thus have to study how to im­ple­ment this in a way that works well.</p>
    <p>“You don’t want mem­bers play­ing to the gallery, but what you do want is peo­ple to be able to watch and to see, oh, this is how Par­lia­ment works,” she said. “So, you have to hold these things in bal­ance.”</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee also re­sponded to sug­ges­tions put up by Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) dur­ing the de­bate to im­prove par­lia­men­tary pro­cesses. Among other things, he had pro­posed that Par­lia­ment in­vest in a new IT sys­tem that can check the at­ten­dance of MPs, es­tab­lish a par­lia­men­tary record of the out­come</p>
    <p>of MPs’ pro­pos­als that min­is­ters had agreed to study, and also pro­vide the op­tion of tak­ing an MP’s speech as read and mak­ing it pub­lic to boost ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>While Ms In­dra­nee said sev­eral of his ideas are worth con­sid­er­ing, she also noted that it may not be fea­si­ble to fully im­ple­ment all of them.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, while copies of speeches could be made avail­able on­line as soon as they are de­liv­ered, she still sees value in hav­ing MPs de­liver speeches in the House.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple need to hear you and they need to hear your con­vic­tion – be­cause oth­er­wise you could have a bril­liantly writ­ten speech by some­body else, and it doesn’t re­flect your voice,” she said.</p>
    <p>It could also be tricky to es­tab­lish a record of the out­come of MPs’ pro­pos­als, she noted.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, gov­ern­ment poli­cies may have taken ref­er­ence from var­i­ous ideas put forth by MPs, but come out in a dif­fer­ent form from what was pro­posed. The Gov­ern­ment, how­ever, gen­er­ally gives credit to those who have con­tributed ideas and sug­ges­tions to a pol­icy, she added.</p>
