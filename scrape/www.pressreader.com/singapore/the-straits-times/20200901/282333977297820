    <p>Most com­pa­nies be­lieve they can keep op­er­a­tions go­ing de­spite the pan­demic, but some small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) ex­pect to down­size or even fold com­pletely, noted a new sur­vey.</p>
    <p>It also found that while 20 per cent of firms said they are likely to re­duce staff, over 60 per cent ex­pect to re­tain the same num­ber of em­ploy­ees over the next year.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey by the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) re­leased yes­ter­day was con­ducted over two weeks last month and gath­ered re­sponses from 225 com­pa­nies – 83 per cent were SMEs, the rest were large en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>SBF chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said: “For the ma­jor­ity of busi­nesses, the un­cer­tain eco­nomic con­di­tions re­main a key con­cern as they con­tinue to face chal­lenges in sus­tain­ing their busi­nesses, man­ag­ing their man­power and cop­ing with cash flow is­sues.”</p>
    <p>About 62 per cent of firms ex­pect the un­cer­tain cli­mate to per­sist. Yet, even un­der th­ese tough con­di­tions, 87 per cent of large com­pa­nies and 66 per cent of SMEs still feel they can sus­tain busi­ness op­er­a­tions, al­beit with thin­ner profit mar­gins or small op­er­at­ing losses.</p>
    <p>But 29 per cent of SMEs and 11 per cent of large com­pa­nies ex­pect to ei­ther down­size or shut their op­er­a­tions en­tirely.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment schemes have helped to cush­ion some of the blow, the firms said, but they are con­cerned about their abil­ity to cope when th­ese are with­drawn.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found that 67 per cent of firms con­ducted a head­count re­view to man­age busi­ness costs.</p>
    <p>Some 62 per cent said they could main­tain staff lev­els for the next year, but 20 per cent said they are likely to re­duce head­count.</p>
    <p>Firms that still plan to hire are more in­clined to em­ploy pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives, SBF found. Those that in­tend to re­duce hir­ing said they are less likely to hire cler­i­cal sup­port, ser­vice and sales work­ers.</p>
    <p>Around 75 per cent of firms said they have seen a drop in pro­duc­tiv­ity. While large com­pa­nies are di­rect­ing more re­sources to dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, SMEs are look­ing at build­ing fi­nan­cial re­silience through re­struc­tur­ing their busi­ness, for in­stance, and in­no­va­tion, be­sides au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses look­ing to ex­pand over­seas are most keen to see In­done­sia re­open for busi­ness travel, fol­lowed by Thai­land and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho said: “Busi­nesses need to take this win­dow of op­por­tu­nity to re­think their busi­ness mod­els and rein­vent them­selves to seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties and re­main vi­able.”</p>
