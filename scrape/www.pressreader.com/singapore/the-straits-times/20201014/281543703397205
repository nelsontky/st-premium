    <p>Dengue cases have dropped by about 70 per cent since the peak of 1,792 re­ported in a sin­gle week in July. But Sin­ga­pore is not “out of the woods” yet, said Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Des­mond Tan.</p>
    <p>Dengue cases have dropped by about 70 per cent since the peak of 1,792 re­ported in a sin­gle week in July.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 532 new cases were re­ported last week, said Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Des­mond Tan in a Face­book post on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore is not “out of the woods” yet, as last week’s case count is “still a very high fig­ure”, added Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>He said that the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s (NEA) Grav­i­t­rap sur­veil­lance sys­tem has also de­tected a rise in the Aedes ae­gypti mos­quito pop­u­la­tion for five con­sec­u­tive weeks now, and that the rate of de­cline in weekly dengue cases has slowed over the last four weeks.</p>
    <p>To avoid a sec­ond spike in weekly dengue num­bers be­fore the end of this year, cases would have to be brought down by more than half, said Mr Tan, who is also Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>He warned that next year might wit­ness another bad out­break, if the new year starts with “a high base­line of dengue cases”.</p>
    <p>This year’s dengue out­break has been the worst in Sin­ga­pore’s history, with 31,341 cases re­ported in the first 41 weeks, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous high of 22,170 re­ported for the whole of 2013.</p>
    <p>As at Mon­day, two of five su­per­clus­ters, with 300 or more peo­ple in­fected, were still ac­tive.</p>
    <p>One in the River Val­ley and Killiney area has had 381 cases since the clus­ter started on June 1, while the other clus­ter in Alju­nied and Gey­lang has had 324 cases since it started on May 19.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, only one su­per­clus­ter had been formed be­tween 2013 and last year. That clus­ter in Choa Chu Kang, with a to­tal of 534 peo­ple in­fected, lasted two months – from June 25 to Aug 25, in 2014.</p>
    <p>Al­to­gether, 176 clus­ters were still ac­tive across the is­land as at Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health said that as at Sept 5, it was no­ti­fied of 21 dengue deaths for this year, with the pa­tients rang­ing be­tween 25 and 92 years old.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of those who died – 18 – worked or lived in ac­tive dengue clus­ters.</p>
    <p>NEA has con­tin­ued to work with town coun­cils and their part­ners to step up dengue preven­tion and con­trol mea­sures in hous­ing es­tates.</p>
    <p>Their ef­forts to con­trol the mos­quito pop­u­la­tion in­clude clean­ing drains and re­mov­ing dis­carded re­cep­ta­cles to pre­vent the ac­cu­mu­la­tion of stag­nant wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan urged res­i­dents, es­pe­cially those liv­ing in dengue clus­ter ar­eas, to re­main vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>“Spray in­sec­ti­cide in dark cor­ners around the house, ap­ply in­sect re­pel­lent reg­u­larly and wear longsleeve tops and long pants,” he said, adding that all should help en­sure that their homes and im­me­di­ate sur­round­ings are free from stag­nant wa­ter.</p>
