    <p>It shows peo­ple who are bipo­lar can still live func­tion­ing lives. They can be doc­tors, they can have love lives, have chil­dren and be happy – with ther­apy, med­i­ca­tion, ex­er­cise and diet all work­ing in tan­dem.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Gi­a­como Giannotti was cast as sur­gi­cal in­tern An­drew DeLuca on Grey’s Anatomy. Since then, Dr DeLuca has steadily be­come more promi­nent on the pop­u­lar med­i­cal drama.</p>
    <p>And his char­ac­ter arc has taken some un­ex­pected turns that the star has wel­comed, he tells The Straits Times in a phone chat from his home in Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the 30some­thing doc­tor’s May-De­cem­ber ro­mance with senior sur­geon Mered­ith Grey (Ellen Pom­peo), who is in her 40s, and his up­com­ing bat­tle with bipo­lar dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>Sea­son 16 of the show, which airs on Fox Life on Sun­days at 9pm (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 301, StarHub TV Chan­nel 501) and streams on Fox+, will see DeLuca come into his own. And his bond with Grey “will grow but be chal­lenged in a lot of dif­fer­ent ways”, says the Ital­ian-Cana­dian star, 31.</p>
    <p>“And as we get to the mid­point of the sea­son, we see some­thing might be go­ing on with DeLuca due to an un­der­ly­ing men­tal ill­ness, which is also at the root of his in­cred­i­ble way of di­ag­nos­ing pa­tients and solving med­i­cal mys­ter­ies.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor says the goal was to des­tig­ma­tise the por­trayal of men­tal ill­ness and show how it can be in­her­ited.</p>
    <p>“So we de­cided to give this ill­ness to DeLuca’s fa­ther, then plant the seed to have some­thing man­i­fest in him a couple of sea­sons down the line. Be­cause in a lot of men­tal ill­ness, you can be pre­dis­posed to it if it runs in your fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>View­ers who have been touched by bipo­lar dis­or­der, ei­ther them­selves or through rel­a­tives, have ap­pre­ci­ated this.</p>
    <p>“I had a lot of them write to me and say, ‘Thank you so much for telling our story be­cause we need more rep­re­sen­ta­tion.’</p>
    <p>“It shows peo­ple who are bipo­lar can still live func­tion­ing lives. They can be doc­tors, they can have love lives, have chil­dren and be happy – with ther­apy, med­i­ca­tion, ex­er­cise and diet all work­ing in tan­dem.</p>
    <p>“And that’s not to say you don’t still have bad days,” he adds. “But the stigma kind of floats away and that’s some­thing we are go­ing to con­tinue to talk about in Sea­son 17.”</p>
    <p>As for his char­ac­ter’s blos­som­ing re­la­tion­ship with Dr Grey, the ac­tor was ini­tially sur­prised when the writ­ers sug­gested it.</p>
    <p>But it hap­pened or­gan­i­cally, he says. “There was a scene in a pre­vi­ous sea­son where Mered­ith had a dream in which I was in her bed, and so was an­other doc­tor.</p>
    <p>“When our showrun­ner Krista Ver­noff saw there was some chem­istry there, and that Ellen and I were good friends and got along, she wanted to see if we could ex­plore that fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>He and Pom­peo, 50, “were both happy and ex­cited about it”, he re­calls.</p>
    <p>One rea­son was they felt the sto­ry­line would chal­lenge the many stereo­types around women dat­ing younger men.</p>
    <p>“No one bats an eye when men date younger women, but when women do it, they are al­most al­ways crit­i­cised,” he notes.</p>
    <p>“Krista wanted to turn that on its head and ask what if an older, ac­com­plished wo­man at the top of her game was dat­ing a younger man – and why can’t that be em­pow­er­ing and some­thing that is cel­e­brated.”</p>
    <p>Pom­peo’s char­ac­ter has a lot of wis­dom to im­part to DeLuca, and Giannotti says he, too, has learnt a lot from his older co-star.</p>
    <p>“Ellen’s been such an amaz­ing role model and men­tor and has al­ways fought for me if there was any­thing in the story we both didn’t agree with.”</p>
    <p>And he is in awe of her pro­fes­sion­al­ism. “Af­ter all this time play­ing the same char­ac­ter, you’d think a per­son would lose in­ter­est, but she has not, and that al­ways im­presses me.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “She’s so in­vested in the writ­ing and the script – fight­ing for things to make sense, to be pow­er­ful, when it would be so easy to not make a fuss and just get through the day.</p>
    <p>“But she still cares so much about mak­ing a good show.”</p>
