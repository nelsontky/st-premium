    <p>Malaysians, es­pe­cially the Malay ma­jor­ity, want Umno to re­main part of the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey late last month by top poll­ster Merdeka Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The largest party in the rul­ing PN has in­ten­si­fied calls in re­cent days to cut ties with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia and force snap polls, less than a year af­ter form­ing the gov­ern­ment to­gether.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey found only 31 per cent of vot­ers agreed that Umno should with­draw from PN, with 44 per cent dis­agree­ing.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, only 21 per cent of Malays – who form the ma­jor­ity in over half of the 222 par­lia­men­tary seats – said Umno should pull out from the pact that unites the coun­try’s three main Malay-Mus­lim par­ties, while 62 per cent wanted PN to stay in­tact.</p>
    <p>The other main Mus­lim party is Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS).</p>
    <p>But the poll, done be­tween Dec 23 and 31, also showed the 1,202 re­spon­dents were nearly evenly split on whether Umno should head into the next elec­tion as part of PN.</p>
    <p>Among Malays, 36 per cent said Umno should go it alone and just over half wanted the once-dom­i­nant party to join forces with Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s coali­tion.</p>
    <p>“In our view, PN’s dom­i­nance among the Malay elec­torate will be neg­a­tively af­fected should Umno de­cide to go it alone and, along with it, cast un­cer­tainty as to the out­come if elec­tions were held,” the Merdeka Cen­tre said in a press re­lease on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It added that this sce­nario could cre­ate sim­i­lar con­di­tions to the wa­ter­shed 2018 elec­tion, when Umno’s six decades of un­in­ter­rupted rule was ended by Pakatan Hara­pan (PH), as Malay vot­ers were split three ways.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din and his party were part of PH in that elec­tion but de­fec­tors in the coali­tion led by him joined hands with Umno and PAS last Fe­bru­ary, lead­ing to the Ber­satu pres­i­dent be­ing sworn in as prime min­is­ter in March with a new rul­ing pact, PN.</p>
    <p>But Umno chafed at play­ing sec­ond fid­dle to Ber­satu in terms of gov­ern­ment posts and in­flu­ence over de­ci­sion-mak­ing, cul­mi­nat­ing in a threat to tor­pedo Bud­get 2021 dur­ing the year-end par­lia­men­tary sit­ting. Still, Umno stayed its hand amid con­cerns that Malaysia’s ef­forts to mit­i­gate the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic would be jeop­ar­dised if gov­ern­ment spend­ing was not ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The party’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ings last week­end, how­ever, saw about three-quar­ters of its di­vi­sions re­solve to ditch Ber­satu and force fresh elec­tions by March.</p>
    <p>Umno’s lead­er­ship was ex­pected to de­cide last night whether to rat­ify these res­o­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that party pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi – who has found him­self side­lined by PM Muhyid­din – wants Umno’s lead­ers to re­sign gov­ern­ment posts by next month.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Ke­lan­tan Umno chief Ah­mad Ja­zlan Yaakub re­signed as Malaysian Palm Oil Board chair­man, while Zahid on Tues­day re­placed the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional coali­tion’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral An­nuar Musa with his own loy­al­ist, Datuk Seri Ah­mad Maslan. Tan Sri An­nuar is one of sev­eral Umno lead­ers in the Muhyid­din Cabi­net who still sup­port co­op­er­a­tion with Ber­satu.</p>
