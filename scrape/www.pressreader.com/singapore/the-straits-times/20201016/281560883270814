    <p>In­dia is brac­ing it­self for a surge of Covid-19 cases in the com­ing weeks as it heads into its main hol­i­day sea­son. De­spite be­ing on track to over­take the United States with the world’s most cases, cash-short states are re­luc­tant to stop peo­ple from ven­tur­ing out dur­ing the Hindu fes­ti­vals of Durga Puja next week and Deepavali next month.</p>
    <p>KOLKATA • Al­ready on track to over­take the US with the world’s most coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, In­dia is brac­ing it­self for a surge in cases as it heads into its main hol­i­day sea­son with an econ­omy eased of virus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­cent ex­pe­ri­ence of the south­ern state of Ker­ala – which was praised for its ini­tial han­dling of the pan­demic – in­di­cates how rapidly the sit­u­a­tion can worsen. Re­ported in­fec­tions there have jumped by five times since it cel­e­brated the 10-day har­vest fes­ti­val of Onam in late Au­gust, far out­pac­ing the twofold in­crease in cases na­tion­ally over that time.</p>
    <p>Still, cash-short state gov­ern­ments are re­luc­tant to stop peo­ple from ven­tur­ing out dur­ing the money-spin­ning Hindu fes­ti­vals of Durga Puja next week and Deepavali in mid-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The an­nual hol­i­days are marked by fam­ily gath­er­ings, bumper buy­ing and the giv­ing of gifts, from sweets and snacks to clothes and cars, gen­er­at­ing vi­tal in­come for many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“We will prob­a­bly have more deaths out of star­va­tion if the ru­ral mi­gra­tory pop­u­la­tion who flock to cities dur­ing the pu­jas (wor­ship rit­u­als) and earn some money dur­ing the fes­tiv­i­ties are de­prived of the op­por­tu­nity,” said Mr Subrata Mukher­jee, a Cab­i­net min­is­ter in the fourth-most pop­u­lous state of West Ben­gal, which has one of In­dia’s high­est Covid-19 caseloads.</p>
    <p>“With sow­ing and trans­plant­ing op­er­a­tions of paddy be­ing over, a large ru­ral pop­u­la­tion is out of any eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity now. Sim­i­larly, thou­sands of small traders are look­ing for­ward to some earn­ings.”</p>
    <p>West Ben­gal, where the rul­ing All In­dia Tri­namool Congress party is ex­pected to face a tough chal­lenge in next year’s elec­tion from Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, has al­lowed 42 per cent more com­mu­nity fes­ti­val gath­er­ings this year and dou­bled state fi­nanc­ing for them.</p>
    <p>Some doc­tors have ac­cused politi­cians of un­der­min­ing pub­lic health out of fear of up­set­ting re­li­gious sen­ti­ments, while Health Min­is­ter Harsh Vard­han has warned that the sit­u­a­tion will worsen if so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules are not fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>“There is no need to con­gre­gate in large numbers to prove your faith or your reli­gion,” Mr Vard­han said in a broad­cast last week.</p>
    <p>“If we do this we may be head­ing for big trouble.”</p>
    <p>In­dia has re­ported more than 7.3 mil­lion in­fec­tions and over 111,000 deaths, though the rate of in­crease has slowed in re­cent weeks. The US has more than 7.9 mil­lion cases, with over 216,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>But doc­tors in In­dia fear fa­tal­i­ties could spike as bad win­ter air pol­lu­tion may worsen the breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties that many Covid-19 pa­tients suf­fer. If cur­rent trends hold, In­dia will over­take the in­fec­tion tally of the United States early next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jan Kho­bra­gade, Ker­ala’s prin­ci­pal health sec­re­tary, re­fer­ring to Onam, said: “Dur­ing the fes­ti­val sea­son, no mat­ter what ef­fort one takes, there is a mix­ing of pop­u­la­tion that hap­pens, which is a mul­ti­plier of cases.”</p>
    <p>In the poorer and big­ger West Ben­gal state, Dr Ab­hi­jit Chowd­hury, a mem­ber of the state gov­ern­ment’s Covid-19 task force, said: “Ben­gal had been a thought leader in many spheres, but un­for­tu­nately the pre-puja trend is an in­di­ca­tion of an im­pend­ing hara-kiri that the peo­ple are go­ing to com­mit.”</p>
    <p>“We seem to be head­ing for a very bad time,” he warned.</p>
