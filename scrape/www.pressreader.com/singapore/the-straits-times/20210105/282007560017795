    <p>The Cen­tre for Do­mes­tic Em­ploy­ees (CDE) ap­pre­ci­ates In­done­sia’s move on place­ment fees, as it will pro­tect the wel­fare of the coun­try’s do­mes­tic work­ers when they work over­seas (In­done­sia’s new place­ment fee plan to pro­tect mi­grant work­ers, Dec 27, 2020).</p>
    <p>How­ever, there could be some un­in­tended con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pre­vail­ing Covid-19 con­di­tions, em­ploy­ers in Sin­ga­pore are re­spon­si­ble for bear­ing the stay-home no­tice (SHN) costs of new for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) who in­tend to work for them.</p>
    <p>The SHN costs can­not be trans­ferred to the FDW.</p>
    <p>From last Fri­day, em­ploy­ers of an FDW also have to pur­chase an up­front ad­di­tional med­i­cal in­surance pol­icy with a cov­er­age of at least $10,000 for her med­i­cal ex­penses if she de­vel­ops Covid-19 symp­toms or tests pos­i­tive within 14 days of ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This in­surance pol­icy must be pur­chased be­fore the FDW ar­rives in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With the above-men­tioned costs and with In­done­sia’s new pol­icy, hir­ing an In­done­sian FDW could be­come more un­bear­able for em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Those with tight fi­nances may turn to hir­ing FDWs from other ap­proved source coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This may cause In­done­sian FDWs to lose em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, if an em­ployer is pay­ing more to hire an In­done­sian FDW, there could be a per­cep­tion that she should be a bet­ter qual­i­fied FDW.</p>
    <p>We are con­cerned that if the FDW fails to meet the ex­pec­ta­tions of the em­ployer, it would lead to a break­down in the re­la­tion­ship. The FDW may end up be­ing sent back to the agent or, worse, repa­tri­ated in the early stages of em­ploy­ment. These are un­de­sir­able out­comes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has al­ready in­sti­tu­tion­alised the max­i­mum amount of fees that em­ploy­ment agen­cies here can charge an FDW.</p>
    <p>CDE be­lieves that to truly ben­e­fit and pro­tect FDWs, the govern­ments of the source coun­tries need to con­sider reg­u­lat­ing em­ploy­ment ser­vices and re­cruit­ment within the coun­try, since most of the fees in­curred are at the source.</p>
    <p>We believe that it would be bet­ter to try to make the re­lated costs of em­ploy­ment rea­son­able and trans­par­ent to FDWs and em­ploy­ers, and we need all stake­hold­ers to take con­crete steps in this di­rec­tion.</p>
