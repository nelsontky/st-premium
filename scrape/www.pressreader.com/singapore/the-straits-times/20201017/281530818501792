    <p>It is not suf­fi­cient for good of­fi­cers to be posted to dif­fer­ent min­istries or agen­cies but do­ing the same roles. It is even more im­por­tant for them to be posted to dif­fer­ent roles. MR CHAN CHUN SING, Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Pub­lic Ser­vice. B3</p>
    <p>An an­nual reshuf­fle of prin­ci­pals will see 43 schools next year with new lead­ers, in­clud­ing nine from the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>It is the high­est num­ber of of­fi­cers to be moved from the head­quar­ters to head schools in re­cent years, ac­cord­ing to checks by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of such trans­fers ranged from three to seven in the past five years.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for MOE said: “School lead­ers are typ­i­cally ro­tated to MOE head­quar­ters for ex­po­sure and to gain in­sights into macro-level ed­u­ca­tion poli­cies and strate­gic is­sues.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese per­spec­tives will be help­ful in fos­ter­ing a greater ap­pre­ci­a­tion of head­quar­ter poli­cies, so that they are bet­ter equipped to trans­late poli­cies to ground prac­tices when they re­turn to schools.”</p>
    <p>The nine MOE of­fi­cers re­turn­ing to schools have pre­vi­ously held school lead­er­ship ap­point­ments as prin­ci­pals or vice-prin­ci­pals, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>One of them is Mr Melvin Cher Teck Yiang, 42, deputy di­rec­tor of MOE’s pre-school ed­u­ca­tion branch in the schools divi­sion, who will be­come prin­ci­pal of Northoaks Pri­mary School.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-prin­ci­pal of Rosyth School said be­ing fa­mil­iar with pol­icy work will come in handy in his new and first ap­point­ment as prin­ci­pal.</p>
    <p>“I have a bet­ter sense of how poli­cies are made and I think this will help in com­mu­ni­cat­ing changes to school staff,” said Mr Cher.</p>
    <p>He will con­tinue to be in­volved in pre-school mat­ters to some ex­tent, as Northoaks Pri­mary houses an MOE kinder­garten.</p>
    <p>“I will work with the pre-school teach­ers and sup­port them in run­ning the cen­tre,” he said, adding that he hopes to get a chance to try out ideas that could help ease the tran­si­tion of pre-school chil­dren into pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>“We have a lot to learn from how pre-school en­vi­ron­ments are set up and some of their teach­ing ap­proaches – some of th­ese can be ap­plied to Pri­mary 1 and Pri­mary 2 classes in par­tic­u­lar,” said Mr Cher.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, a pre-school class­room is very vi­brant; we want chil­dren to feel wel­come and en­gaged. There’s a lot of em­pha­sis on ex­pe­ri­en­tial learn­ing and get­ting chil­dren to be cu­ri­ous about the world around them, and to ask ques­tions.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are good habits and dis­po­si­tions for learn­ing that ap­ply to pri­mary school chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, MOE said that the process of ap­point­ing and ro­tat­ing prin­ci­pals al­lows schools to ben­e­fit from new per­spec­tives. Ex­pe­ri­enced prin­ci­pals can also share best prac­tices across schools, it added.</p>
    <p>As part of the reshuf­fle, St An­drew’s Se­condary School and Guangyang Pri­mary School will be among 23 schools to have first-time prin­ci­pals.</p>
    <p>Among them is Madam Foo Boon Ching, who will head Yangzheng Pri­mary School. She is cur­rently vice-prin­ci­pal of Pei Tong Pri­mary School.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers from MOE head­quar­ters mak­ing the move in­clude Mr Tham Kine Thong, di­rec­tor of school op­er­a­tions pol­icy in MOE’s schools divi­sion. He will be head­ing St An­drew’s Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Madam Yvonne Teo, deputy di</p>

    <p>rec­tor of as­sess­ment pol­icy and prac­tice in MOE’s cur­ricu­lum pol­icy of­fice, will move to lead Be­dok View Se­condary School.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, MOE said: “For the 23 newly ap­pointed prin­ci­pals, this is an im­por­tant ca­reer mile­stone as they as­sume greater re­spon­si­bil­i­ties as lead­ers in ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“For the 20 cur­rent prin­ci­pals and head­quar­ter of­fi­cers who will be as­sum­ing new prin­ci­pal­ship ap­point­ments, it is an af­fir­ma­tion of MOE’s con­fi­dence in their abil­i­ties to con­tinue lead­ing and guid­ing our teach­ers, staff and stu­dents in schools.”</p>
    <p>The 43 new prin­ci­pals will re­ceive their let­ters of ap­point­ment from MOE’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral of ed­u­ca­tion Wong Siew Hoong at a cer­e­mony in December, to be at­tended by Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong.</p>
    <p>At the cer­e­mony, MOE will also ac­knowl­edge the con­tri­bu­tions of re­tir­ing prin­ci­pals and se­nior ed­u­ca­tion of­fi­cers from its head­quar­ters who have for­merly served as prin­ci­pals.</p>
