    <p>Sin­ga­porean ac­tress Rebecca Lim would like to say that she picked up new skills dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in Sin­ga­pore which halted pro­duc­tion shoots, but the fact of the mat­ter is, the 33-year-old spent most of her time in bed, sleep­ing.</p>
    <p>In a phone in­ter­view with The Straits Times, she says: “Hon­estly, I want to say I’ve done a lot, but I mainly just stayed at home and slept a lot be­cause I’ve barely had any breaks in the past four or five years.</p>
    <p>“I spent a lot of time with my mum and my fam­ily. My lit­tle niece ar­rived just two months be­fore the cir­cuit breaker so she brought us a lot of joy.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond of three chil­dren, she lives with her par­ents and her el­der brother’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She did her fair share to help the com­mu­nity right be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, how­ever, hand-de­liv­er­ing care pack­ages to old folks and the less priv­i­leged liv­ing in one-room flats, mi­grant work­ers and taxi driv­ers.</p>
    <p>She has qui­etly been do­ing such phi­lan­thropic work since four years ago. Each year, she or­gan­ises a Chi­nese New Year lun­cheon and lo hei with old folks liv­ing alone and a care pack­age de­liv­ery drive in her birth­day month of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“At first, I just did it with my fan­club be­cause we’ll have gath­er­ings and we wanted to do some­thing mean­ing­ful on my birth­day,” she says.</p>
    <p>But as her Chi­nese New Year lun­cheon was in­ter­rupted by the Covid-19 out­break this year, she de­cided to give out care pack­ages for the pan­demic pe­riod. Th­ese are filled with hand sani­tis­ers, daily es­sen­tial items and sup­ple­ments like vi­ta­mins.</p>
    <p>She ex­plains: “It be­came a twoman show, just my as­sis­tant and I – we spent one day pack­ing and two days de­liv­er­ing the pack­ages.”</p>
    <p>Lim will likely or­gan­ise an­other care pack­age drive next month when she has a two-day break in her sched­ule.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress has jumped straight back into work af­ter Covid-19 re­stric­tions were eased to al­low pro­duc­tion shoots and her sched­ule has been packed full since June.</p>
    <p>She hosted this year’s so­cially dis­tanced in­door Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) and is cur­rently hard at work film­ing her new drama, Jun­gle Sur­vivor.</p>
    <p>She says of the NDP gig: “The en­tire con­cept is a first for the NDP so to be part of some­thing so his­toric is a sil­ver lin­ing in the midst of ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>Be­ing part of the NDP is also a life­long dream for Lim, whose pri­mary school­mates per­formed in the an­nual ex­trav­a­ganza when she was in Pri­mary 5.</p>
    <p>“I missed out on it be­cause I had track and field train­ing and a choir con­cert,” she says. “And I never thought I would par­tic­i­pate in such a big way, per­form­ing and host­ing and singing my favourite Na­tional Day song, Home. It was very sur­real and in­spir­ing.”</p>
    <p>Re­cently, lux­ury Swiss watch­maker Longines named her a friend of the brand.</p>
    <p>“It was such a won­der­ful co­in­ci­dence be­cause the first time­piece I bought for my­self, which is very spe­cial to me, was when I won Best Ac­tress in 2018,” she says, re­fer­ring to her Star Awards win for The Lead (2017) – a drama cen­tred on the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try where she played a wannabe ac­tress turned wardrobe as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>“I bought a piece from t he Longines Hy­droCon­quest col­lec­tion be­cause it was a clas­sic de­sign. I could see my sis­ter and my mother wear­ing it too so it made economic sense.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “2020 has been a tough year but, for me, it’s also a year where a lot of dreams came true – be­ing in NDP, be­ing an am­bas­sador for a time­piece – which is some­thing I never thought would hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>This year also hap­pens to mark a full decade in Lim’s tran­si­tion to a full-time ac­tress af­ter grad­u­at­ing from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity with an ac­coun­tancy de­gree and a ma­jor in law.</p>
    <p>She pauses when asked how it felt to be en­ter­ing her sec­ond decade of act­ing.</p>
    <p>“I can’t be­lieve it’s been 10 years, oh my gosh,” she laughs.</p>
    <p>“It’s very easy to rest on your lau­rels in this in­dus­try be­cause peo­ple say only good things about you in front of you and no one dares to tell you the hard truth or things you need to im­prove on. I’m glad that I have a small group of very close friends who are very hon­est with me and a close-knit fam­ily who ground me.”</p>
    <p>Her next big role will come in the drama se­ries Jun­gle Sur­vivor, in which she plays a jilted house­wife who loses her hus­band to a ca­reer woman and de­cides to re-en­ter the work­force, en­coun­ter­ing of­fice pol­i­tics and a messy love tri­an­gle.</p>
    <p>Off-screen, Lim was dragged into a cheat­ing scan­dal too. Last year, ac­tor Ian Fang, long linked to the ac­tress, was caught ex­chang­ing sex­u­ally sug­ges­tive mes­sages with an­other Me­di­a­corp ac­tress Car­rie Wong, who has a Tai­wanese boyfriend.</p>
    <p>Lim, who has re­frained from com­ment­ing on the scan­dal, and Fang have main­tained that they are just friends.</p>
    <p>In the se­ries, Pierre Png will take the role of her un­faith­ful hus­band while Feli­cia Chin will be both her neme­sis at work and in love. The show, which is ex­pected to pre­miere late this year, has been touted as the lo­cal ver­sion of hit K-drama World Of The Mar­ried.</p>
    <p>“I think peo­ple draw com­par­isons be­cause of the ex­tra­mar­i­tal af­fair bit, but a large part of the drama is on of­fice pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>“My char­ac­ter is a house­wife for 12 years un­til her hus­band leaves her for his col­league and she goes back to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>“There’s not that much hair­pulling and shout­ing – it’s more about how my char­ac­ter learns to pro­tect her­self. Her growth as a char­ac­ter is very at­trac­tive to me.”</p>
    <p>While pre­view clips of the se­ries show Lim and Chin trad­ing snipes and in­sults, in real life, Lim would prob­a­bly not fight with an­other woman for a man.</p>
    <p>Just por­tray­ing the cat­fights on­screen has tired her out “phys­i­cally and emo­tion­ally”.</p>
    <p>She says: “It’s so com­pet­i­tive. They’re al­ways try­ing to one-up each other and be bet­ter than the other all the time. Per­haps it’s be­cause I’m a Libra so per­son­ally I’m the kind who’s more bal­anced and calm, hence this role was very psy­cho­log­i­cally drain­ing for me.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully Feli­cia and I can get a com­edy or some­thing less catty next time, as best friends or sis­ters.”</p>
    <p>Rebecca Lim is cur­rently hard at work film­ing drama Jun­gle Sur­vivor, in which she plays a house­wife who re­turns to work af­ter her hus­band leaves her.</p>
