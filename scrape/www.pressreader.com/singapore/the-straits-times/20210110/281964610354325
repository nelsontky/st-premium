    <p>Dr Chng Shuyun’s in­ter­est in chem­istry started back in sec­ondary school. But the 33-year-old never re­alised how much of an im­pact the sub­ject would have on so­ci­ety un­til she joined the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s (A*Star) Singapore In­sti­tute of Man­u­fac­tur­ing Tech­nol­ogy (SIMTech) and com­pleted a PhD in or­ganic chem­istry.</p>
    <p>She says: “As part of SIMTech’s sur­face tech­nol­ogy group, I saw how chem­istry knowl­edge could cre­ate end­less pos­si­bil­i­ties in coat­ing for­mu­la­tion and pro­cesses, to give very dif­fer­ent sur­face func­tions and prop­er­ties, be it for pro­tec­tion, func­tion or aes­thet­ics.”</p>
    <p>Dr Chng was re­cently in­volved in the de­vel­op­ment of re­us­able masks that were dis­trib­uted as part of the na­tion­wide mask dis­tri­bu­tion ex­er­cise and Na­tional Day Pa­rade Singapore To­gether pack — part of Singapore’s ef­forts against the Covid-19 out­break. The team worked to de­velop the var­i­ous lay­ers to cre­ate a breath­able, re­us­able mask that is al­most as ef­fec­tive as med­i­cal masks, yet com­fort­able and re­us­able as cloth masks.</p>
    <p>In part­ner­ship with a lo­cal com­pany, she is also lead­ing re­search to de­velop and scale up the pro­duc­tion of a durable anti-mi­cro­bial coat­ing that can be de­ployed on large sur­face ar­eas. This would help to pre­vent the trans­mis­sion of mi­crobes on high-touch sur­faces.</p>
    <p>Dr Chng joined SIMTech as a re­search en­gi­neer in 2011. In 2012, she was awarded the Over­seas A*Star Grad­u­ate Schol­ar­ship.</p>
    <p>She says: “Em­bark­ing on a PhD pro­gramme is like be­ing thrown into the deep end. One is trained to iden­tify prob­lems, in­de­pen­dently seek so­lu­tions and an­swers, build re­silience in the face of re­peated fail­ures while learn­ing from them, as well as be­come com­fort­able with un­cer­tain­ties, to cre­ate knowl­edge — all within four years.”</p>
    <p>In her el­e­ment</p>
    <p>Dr Chng un­der­took her PhD stud­ies at the Univer­sity of Ox­ford in Eng­land. In early 2012, she had met a vis­it­ing Ox­ford pro­fes­sor — who later be­came her PhD su­per­vi­sor — whose spe­cial­ity was sur­face-re­lated chem­istry. She says: “The work he did res­onated with me. This, in ad­di­tion to the grand Harry Pot­ter-like cam­pus and mod­ern chem­istry labs at Ox­ford, in­flu­enced my choice of univer­sity.”</p>
    <p>At Ox­ford, Dr Chng had full au­ton­omy to de­cide the topic she wanted to work on and how she wanted to go about do­ing it. This honed her re­source­ful­ness, crit­i­cal think­ing and project man­age­ment abil­i­ties, which ben­e­fit her work now.</p>
    <p>She also grew as a com­mu­ni­ca­tor, col­lab­o­ra­tor and leader. “If a po­ten­tial project re­quired cer­tain skill sets that were lack­ing in the team, I would proac­tively try to col­lab­o­rate with oth­ers. Be­yond writ­ing pa­pers and pre­sent­ing to peers, we now need to present our work to var­i­ous com­pa­nies and in­dus­tries to garner their sup­port through in­dus­try projects and grants.</p>
    <p>“Ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tion within a multi­na­tional team is also key to en­sure that ev­ery­one works in a co­he­sive man­ner.”</p>
    <p>Dr Chng was ap­pointed sec­tion man­ager of the func­tional coat­ings sec­tion at SIMTech in April 2019. To­day — in ad­di­tion to work­ing on na­tional-scale projects such as anti-mi­cro­bial coat­ings — she is also de­vel­op­ing a durable ice-pho­bic coat­ing for the aero­space in­dus­try, which could re­duce the num­ber of avi­a­tion ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>She says: “I wouldn’t be where I am to­day with­out this schol­ar­ship — ful­fill­ing my pas­sion while know­ing that I am con­tribut­ing in my lit­tle way to the na­tion, to in­dus­try and to the lives of people.”</p>
