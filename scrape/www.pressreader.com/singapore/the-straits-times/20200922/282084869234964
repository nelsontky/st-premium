    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod started i n A p r i l , Mr O l i v e r Win­grove found it a chal­lenge get­ting his reg­u­lar ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>In­stead of play­ing foot­ball reg­u­larly as usual, Mr Win­grove and his friends de­cided to take more walks and started think­ing about hik­ing cir­cuits at places such as MacRitchie Reser­voir and the Bukit Timah Na­ture Re­serve.</p>
    <p>But the 54-year-old Bri­ton, who has been a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) for about 20 years, said it also got him think­ing about the chal­lenges that oth­ers are fac­ing due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Every­one is hav­ing chal­lenges at the mo­ment due to the pan­demic but there are al­ways peo­ple who have it a lot tougher than we do,” said Mr Win­grove.</p>
    <p>So he and three of his long-time friends who are also Sin­ga­pore PRs – Mr Si­mon Hamer, 52, Mr Chris Tidy, 50, and Mr Greg Clay, 60 – de­cided to plan a 150km walk around Sin­ga­pore to raise money for res­i­den­tial chil­dren’s home Mel­rose Home.</p>
    <p>The home is run by phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion Chil­dren’s Aid So­ci­ety and helps vul­ner­a­ble chil­dren and youth who face ad­verse fam­ily cir­cum­stances, fam­ily vi­o­lence or child neglect is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mr Win­grove, who works for Ger­man soft­ware cor­po­ra­tion SAP as its head of hy­per­scaler pro­grammes and has been based in Sin­ga­pore for 23 years now, said: “There are lots of causes that could use sup­port right now, but help­ing chil­dren, in par­tic­u­lar, is an area I am keen to give back in.”</p>
    <p>He has two chil­dren – son Henry, 19, is serv­ing his na­tional ser­vice with the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force, and daugh­ter Annabel, 21, is head­ing back to London for work as part of her dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing univer­sity course. His wife Jus­tine, 52, runs her own prop­erty es­tate man­age­ment and devel­op­ment firm.</p>
    <p>“My chil­dren are for­tu­nate and priv­i­leged to have a good ed­u­ca­tion and a sta­ble up­bring­ing. But we can’t take for granted that ev­ery fam­ily and child has that same luck and op­por­tu­ni­ties. That’s why I’m keen to give back,” he said.</p>
    <p>Last month, the group of four com­pleted a “warm up” 39km walk from Sin­ga­pore’s north to south – set­ting off from the SAF Yacht Club in Ad­mi­ralty and end­ing at Tan­jong Beach in Sen­tosa. It took them 71/</p>
    <p>2 hours.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, they clocked a 58km walk from the is­land’s west­ern to east­ern side – be­gin­ning at Raf­fles Ma­rina in Tuas and end­ing at Changi Beach. It took 121/ hours.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>They will at­tempt the full 150km loop on Sept 30, start­ing and end­ing at VivoC­ity in Har­bourFront.</p>
    <p>Mr Win­grove said they aim to com­plete the walk over three days, and they will rent a room at a ho­tel near wher­ever they stop for the night.</p>
    <p>So far, they have raised about $13,000. The aim is to hit $15,000.</p>
    <p>The money will go to­wards de­vel­op­ing an un­used field next to Mel­rose Home’s premises in Boon Lay, so the chil­dren can have a foot­ball pitch and a play­ground.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of the home are typ­i­cally be­tween the ages of six and 18, and in­clude chil­dren re­ferred by Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) for place­ment due to on­go­ing pro­tec­tion is­sues, and oth­ers re­ferred by community agen­cies and fam­i­lies be­cause of var­i­ous so­cial con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a 2018 an­nual re­port up­loaded on the so­ci­ety’s web­site, Mel­rose Home’s monthly av­er­age op­er­at­ing cost is about $241,000. About 53 per cent of this cost is funded by the MSF and the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice Care and Share Move­ment Fund.</p>
    <p>The rest of the op­er­at­ing cost is funded by do­na­tions from cor­po­ra­tions, or­gan­ised groups and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>There were 59 res­i­dents be­ing cared for in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Win­grove said: “The kids there have a tough time. We want to help and (de­vel­op­ing the field) seems like a good tan­gi­ble target.</p>
    <p>“At this mo­ment, as a community, it’s im­por­tant that every­one sticks to­gether to get through these chal­lenges we are fac­ing.”</p>
    <p>TOUGHER SIT­U­A­TION FOR SOME</p>
    <p>Every­one is hav­ing chal­lenges at the mo­ment due to the pan­demic but there are al­ways peo­ple who have it a lot tougher than we do.</p>
