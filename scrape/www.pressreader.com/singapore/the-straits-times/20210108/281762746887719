    <p>SHANG­HAI • Tears filled Ms Gui Yuna’s eyes as she de­scribed los­ing her right leg in a road ac­ci­dent when she was seven and school bul­lies kick­ing away her crutch to make her fall.</p>
    <p>But they would not dare do that now.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old is a prize-win­ning body­builder and for­mer Paralympia­n whose inspiratio­nal story has gone vi­ral in China.</p>
    <p>Ms Gui, who com­peted in long jump at the 2004 Athens Par­a­lympics, is new to body­build­ing but won the first time she com­peted in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Im­ages of her strut­ting on stage in a high-heel shoe and bikini, all while lean­ing on her crutch, fea­tured heav­ily in Chi­nese me­dia and won her a size­able on­line fol­low­ing.</p>
    <p>With her steely de­ter­mi­na­tion and pos­i­tive at­ti­tude, she has been feted as an in­spi­ra­tion in a coun­try where peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties are all too of­ten marginalis­ed.</p>
    <p>“It’s pos­si­ble that I won first place not be­cause of my pro­fes­sion­al­ism or mus­cles, but be­cause of my con­fi­dence and brav­ery to stand on the stage and show my­self to ev­ery­one,” said Ms Gui.</p>
    <p>She spoke fol­low­ing an in­tense work­out at a Shang­hai gym, ses­sions that she posts reg­u­larly to her 200,000 fol­low­ers on TikTok.</p>
    <p>Ms Gui has al­most no mem­ory of the fate­ful day when she was hit by a truck on her way home from school.</p>
    <p>But she can­not for­get how, as a young child with only a stump where her right leg used to be, chil­dren at school tor­mented her by kick­ing away her crutch or yank­ing away her chair as she sat down.</p>
    <p>“They called me a crip­ple or three-legged cat,” said Ms Gui, tears welling in her eyes, even though this was nearly three decades ago. “Most of the time it was abu­sive lan­guage like that and some­times phys­i­cal abuse.”</p>
    <p>She added: “The first time they made me fall I cried but then I got used to it and I thought, you can bully me how­ever you want, but I’ll be fine be­cause I have a brave heart.”</p>
    <p>Ms Gui, who is from the south­ern city of Nan­ning, was raised by her mother as her fa­ther died be­fore she was born.</p>
    <p>The odds were stacked against her but Ms Gui’s ath­leti­cism matched her de­ter­mi­na­tion and in 2001 she be­came in­volved in par­a­lympic sports, go­ing on to rep­re­sent China at the 2004 Games, fin­ish­ing sev­enth in her long jump cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>She also did high jump and later archery, and took part in the torch re­lay for the 2008 Bei­jing Sum­mer Games and Par­a­lympics.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­tir­ing from com­pe­ti­tion in 2017, Ms Gui en­dured yet more dis­crim­i­na­tion in the work­ing world, re­jected by em­ploy­ers who said she did not match their im­age.</p>
    <p>“(They were) im­ply­ing that I’d dam­age their im­age,” she said. “I ap­plied to nearly 20 com­pa­nies and all of them said the same thing.”</p>
    <p>And while many on­line com­ments com­mended her af­ter her body­build­ing de­but, where she daz­zled in a tra­di­tional high-necked qi­pao dress and beat able-bod­ied ri­vals, there were a few dis­sent­ing voices telling her to stay at home.</p>
    <p>Oc­ca­sion­ally, peo­ple on the street would ask Ms Gui what hap­pened to her right leg and she is taken aback – miss­ing a limb is so nor­mal to her now that she no longer thinks about it.</p>
    <p>Her crutch is al­ways close at hand but she ap­pears to have few trou­bles ne­go­ti­at­ing ev­ery­day life.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple think that fate was un­kind to me but I don’t think so,” said Ms Gui, who af­ter the initial re­jec­tions is now a part­ner at a com­pany spe­cial­is­ing in home dec­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“I am thank­ful for hav­ing th­ese hard­ships. Why do I say that? Be­cause of this I grew up, it made my heart stronger and made me who I am to­day,” she said.</p>
