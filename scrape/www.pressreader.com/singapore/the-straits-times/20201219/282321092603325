    <p>He was con­sid­ered a late bloomer in the bal­let world, hav­ing started for­mal train­ing only at 17 – more than a decade be­hind most pro­fes­sional dancers.</p>
    <p>But, in just three years, the son of an electric rick­shaw driver from Delhi was ac­cepted by the pres­ti­gious Eng­lish Na­tional Bal­let School, mak­ing him one of the first In­di­ans to be ad­mit­ted. He had lit­tle in his pocket, but man­aged to crowd­fund his way to the Lon­don school with help from Ar­gen­tine dance mae­stro Fer­nando Aguil­era.</p>
    <p>Aguil­era was amazed by Singh’s flex­i­bil­ity when the young man first turned up at his Im­pe­rial Fer­nando Bal­let Com­pany, and took him un­der his wing.</p>
    <p>Now based in Lon­don, Singh told The Straits Times that he is pre­par­ing for an au­di­tion that he hopes will be his ticket to be­com­ing a lead dancer.</p>
    <p>Con­fi­dence, he said, is key to pur­su­ing one’s dreams, and “never think that oth­ers are bet­ter than you”.</p>
