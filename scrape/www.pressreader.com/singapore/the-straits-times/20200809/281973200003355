    <p>Huawei’s trou­bles around the world may be far from over, but an­other two Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies have tem­po­rar­ily sup­planted the Chi­nese tele­com equip­ment maker as hot tar­gets in an in­ten­si­fy­ing ri­valry be­tween the world’s two big­gest pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Bytedance, the par­ent com­pany of the video-shar­ing sen­sa­tion TikTok; and Ten­cent, which owns the su­per app WeChat, have found them­selves in the United States’ crosshairs in a geopo­lit­i­cal bat­tle set against the back­drop of ris­ing techno-na­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of threats, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Fri­day or­dered a ban on the two so­cial me­dia plat­forms from</p>
    <p>Sept 20, cit­ing a na­tional se­cu­rity risk that could al­low China to ob­tain the per­sonal in­for­ma­tion of mil­lions of Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>It im­me­di­ately drew a strong re­buke from Bei­jing, but no fore­warn­ing of re­tal­i­a­tion just yet.</p>
    <p>“Some US poli­cies against TikTok and oth­ers are based on le­git­i­mate con­cerns about data pri­vacy and po­ten­tial po­lit­i­cal in­ter­fer­ence from China, but they are also un­de­ni­ably be­ing driven by a techno-na­tion­al­ist push from Trump in the run-in to Novem­ber’s elec­tion,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor in Prac­tice James Crab­tree at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The twin bans come on the heels of an an­nounce­ment of a “Clean Net­work” pro­gramme that aims to pro­hibit China’s ac­cess to</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can data.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo had last week un­veiled the five-pronged plan that would, among other things, pre­vent “un­trusted” Chi­nese car­ri­ers from con­nect­ing to US tele­com net­works; Chi­nese smart­phone mak­ers from pre-in­stalling cer­tain apps; and Chi­nese cloud ser­vice providers from col­lect­ing and stor­ing sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion of Amer­i­can cit­i­zens and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state me­dia have been quick to cast these moves as Amer­i­can bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>“With the US cut­ting its fi­nan­cial sup­port for sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy due to the costly wars it waged in Afghanista­n and Iraq, and China mak­ing rapid tech­no­log­i­cal progress thanks to its in­creased spend­ing dur­ing the same pe­riod, the US no longer en­joys the over­whelm­ing dom­i­nance it once did in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy,” said a China Daily edi­to­rial on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“As such, although Pom­peo cited na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns as the rea­son, the pur­pose of the ‘clean net­work’ cam­paign, which is dirty in both the ideas and the means, is to keep Chi­nese in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies on the ropes, so as to give the US some time to re­gain the com­mand­ing heights in high-tech.”</p>
    <p>RISE OF CHI­NESE TECH</p>
    <p>The rise of China’s pri­vate tech sec­tor has been noth­ing short of ex­tra­or­di­nary.</p>
    <p>The world has mar­velled at how, from a mes­sag­ing app launched in 2011, Ten­cent’s WeChat has since man­aged to com­bine the ser­vices akin to Face­book, PayPal, Google, Ama­zon and Uber, etc, into a one-stop shop.</p>
    <p>Its over one bil­lion users rely on the app to pay for food, shop­ping and util­i­ties; buy plane, train and movie tick­ets; and read the news or chat with friends, mak­ing the app an in­dis­pens­able part of ev­ery­day life in China.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent was worth US$686 bil­lion (S$941 bil­lion) be­fore Mr Trump’s Fri­day an­nounce­ment, mak­ing it one of Asia’s most valu­able com­pa­nies and among the world’s top In­ter­net com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>It was the first Chi­nese com­pany to make it to a Top 10 list of the world’s big­gest brands in 2017, along­side Google, Ap­ple, Face­book and Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba joined the ranks a year later.</p>
    <p>TikTok, the other tar­get in Mr Trump’s sights, is a short-video app that boasts of hav­ing two bil­lion reg­is­tered users in the world, in­clud­ing 165 mil­lion in the US. US law­mak­ers worry that be­cause of the plat­form’s Chi­nese own­er­ship, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment could ac­cess its users’ data or use it for pur­poses of es­pi­onage. But ev­i­dence is thin for that, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>The law­mak­ers’ con­cerns are also mit­i­gated by the fact that TikTok is an en­ter­tain­ment plat­form widely used by young Amer­i­cans, said geo-tech­nol­ogy se­nior an­a­lyst Xiaomeng Lu of Eura­sia Group.</p>
    <p>“The type of data col­lected from this au­di­ence isn’t as valu­able as the large-scale data al­ready leaked or hacked from OPM and Equifax,” she told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The US ar­rested a Chi­nese na­tional in 2017 sus­pected of be­ing in­volved in steal­ing the in­for­ma­tion of more than 22 mil­lion peo­ple from the records of the Of­fice of Per­son­nel Man­age­ment, which man­ages the US gov­ern­ment’s civil­ian work­force.</p>
    <p>Four mem­bers of the Chi­nese mil­i­tary were also ac­cused by the</p>
    <p>US Depart­ment of Jus­tice in Fe­bru­ary this year of hack­ing US credit rat­ing agency Equifax and col­lect­ing the pri­vate in­for­ma­tion of over 150 mil­lion peo­ple in 2017.</p>
    <p>CHI­NESE COM­MU­NIST PARTY IN­FLU­ENCE</p>
    <p>At the core of this grow­ing ner­vous­ness is a set of Chi­nese laws over cy­ber se­cu­rity and na­tional in­tel­li­gence passed in 2017 that al­lows the gov­ern­ment ac­cess to data from net­work op­er­a­tors in the coun­try, and man­date any or­gan­i­sa­tion or cit­i­zen to as­sist in state in­tel­li­gence work.</p>
    <p>In China’s quest for tech supremacy and to re­duce its re­liance on for­eign play­ers, it has des­ig­nated some of its top en­ter­prises as “na­tional cham­pi­ons of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence”.</p>
    <p>In 2017, it gave Alibaba, Ten­cent, Baidu and iF­lytek the man­date to take the devel­op­ment of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to greater heights in var­i­ous ar­eas, such as au­ton­o­mous driv­ing and voice in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Last year, it added Huawei, video sur­veil­lance leader Hikvi­sion, elec­tron­ics gi­ant Xiaomi, e-com­merce gi­ant JD.com and sev­eral oth­ers to the “na­tional team”.</p>
    <p>More con­tro­ver­sially, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has also, since last year, made its pres­ence felt in hun­dreds of Chi­nese com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Alibaba in what has been seen as a bid to ex­ert greater in­flu­ence over the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials have been phys­i­cally sta­tioned in these com­pa­nies in a move that the au­thor­i­ties claim helps make the work be­tween the gov­ern­ment and these com­pa­nies more ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate en­ter­prises have also been re­quired to in­sti­tute Com­mu­nist Party branches or com­mit­tees if they have three or more party mem­bers among their staff. The state me­dia say these cells help to “en­hance cor­po­rate man­age­ment and im­prove team­work with­out med­dling in de­ci­sion-mak­ing pro­cesses”.</p>
    <p>That the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party – which counts Alibaba founder Jack Ma, among 92 mil­lion oth­ers, as a mem­ber – is per­va­sive in prac­ti­cally all as­pects of Chi­nese life is a fact that lib­eral democ­ra­cies find ex­tremely hard to fathom and stom­ach.</p>
    <p>And so, Chi­nese pri­vate com­pa­nies will never be able to shake off the wide­spread sus­pi­cion that they are at least not tools of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment in some shape or form.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries have acted on these sus­pi­cions, with Aus­tralia, Bri­tain, France and the US mov­ing to ban or re­strict Huawei from their 5G net­works, and In­dia block­ing 59 Chi­nese apps in­clud­ing TikTok and WeChat.</p>
    <p>REPER­CUS­SIONS OR REC­ON­CIL­I­A­TION?</p>
    <p>China has fewer op­tions to re­tal­i­ate.</p>
    <p>Its Great Fire­wall has long shut out the likes of Google, Face­book, Twit­ter, In­sta­gram and other pop­u­lar for­eign apps.</p>
    <p>“It will look for those ar­eas of trade with the United States where it can ban with­out harm­ing China’s in­ter­ests, such as agri­cul­ture, con­sumer goods and en­ter­tain­ment. It will ac­cel­er­ate its in­vest­ments and es­pi­onage to make China tech­no­log­i­cally in­de­pen­dent,” noted Dr James An­drew Lewis, di­rec­tor of tech­nol­ogy pol­icy at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies think-tank.</p>
    <p>At its an­nual par­lia­men­tary ses­sion in May this year, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment an­nounced it was pump­ing in 10 tril­lion yuan (S$1.97 tril­lion) over the next six years in an am­bi­tious plan to ramp up dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture and re­duce its de­pen­dence on for­eign tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>This big push dove­tails with in­dus­trial blue­prints pre­vi­ously set out in its Made In China 2025 and China Stan­dards 2035 ini­tia­tives, and tasks home-grown giants like Huawei and Baidu to mas­sively pave 5G net­works, de­velop ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and build data cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has in re­cent months also urged en­trepreneur­s and of­fi­cials to step up in­no­va­tion and em­bark on a new “in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion” eco­nomic model that taps do­mes­tic con­sump­tion and re­duces ex­port-re­liance.</p>
    <p>China cer­tainly does not want a di­vorce. Its top two diplo­mats have over the week sent out pos­i­tive vibes, with For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi urg­ing the US to “re­ject de­cou­pling”, while Polit­buro mem­ber Yang Jiechi said the door to di­a­logue has al­ways been open.</p>
    <p>US ac­tions against Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies will blunt their global am­bi­tions and make them lose their con­fi­dence in the US mar­ket, said Eura­sia Group’s Ms Lu.</p>
    <p>She cited an ex­o­dus of such firms from the Amer­i­can cap­i­tal mar­ket, among them Alibaba’s fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy arm Ant Group, which has shunned New York for a dual list­ing in Shang­hai and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>China’s big­gest online travel com­pany CTrip is also re­ported to be mulling over leav­ing Nas­daq to go pri­vate.</p>
    <p>“This trend will con­tinue to ex­ac­er­bate lead­ing up to the Novem­ber pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. A po­ten­tial (Joe) Bi­den pres­i­dency may lead to re­assess­ment of the treat­ment of Chi­nese tech to the ex­tent that dam­age con­trol is fea­si­ble,” she said.</p>
