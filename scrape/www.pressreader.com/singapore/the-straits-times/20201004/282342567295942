    <p>Head­ing to Jewel Changi Air­port for work is hardly the same as go­ing on va­ca­tion, but spend­ing the af­ter­noon there of­fers a re­fresh­ing change of scenery.</p>
    <p>The pay-per-use lounge (above), for­merly for tran­sit pas­sen­gers and those on fly-cruise itin­er­ar­ies, re­opened as a co-work­ing space in Au­gust. It seats 50, but had fewer than 10 peo­ple in the morn­ing I spent there. Larger than the one at Grand Copthorne Wa­ter­front Ho­tel and less crowded than Fu­rama River­Front’s, it feels the most lux­u­ri­ous of the three I vis­ited.</p>
    <p>It is also su­per clean. Sur­faces such as ta­bles and chairs are coated with an an­timi­cro­bial coat­ing that de­ac­ti­vates viruses and kills bac­te­ria and fungi, which works for up to 90 days.</p>
    <p>OF­FICE FOR THE DAY</p>
    <p>Arm­chairs and couches are invit­ing, but no one wants to hunch over a cof­fee ta­ble all day.</p>
    <p>The lounge pro­vides por­ta­ble steel-and-glass mini-desks you can shift to your couch of choice. There are am­ple power points, and the Wi-Fi is speedy and sta­ble.</p>
    <p>For max­i­mum pro­duc­tiv­ity, I go for a long ta­ble against the wall, kit­ted out with dimmable ta­ble lamps and a hard-backed chair that my lower back agrees with.</p>
    <p>It feels like a sleeker, more grown-up ver­sion of a univer­sity li­brary.</p>
    <p>FEEL­ING PECK­ISH?</p>
    <p>Two-hour pack­ages ($15) come with a drink, such as cof­fee, tea, soft drinks and Milo, and a pas­try. An a la carte menu of bar bites (above) such as pop­corn chicken and fries, with items priced be­tween $4.50 and $12.90, was launched last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>PERKS</p>
    <p>Four- and eight-hour pack­ages ($24 and $44) come with free-flow drinks as part of a lim­ited pro­mo­tion, as well as free park­ing.</p>
