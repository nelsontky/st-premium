    <p>The HCA Day Hos­pice is closed un­til Feb 1 af­ter a fire broke out at the HCA Hos­pice Care head­quar­ters in Serangoon Road on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients of the hos­pice will be cared for at home and meals will be delivered to those in need.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients and their fam­i­lies have been in­formed, said HCA Hos­pice Care in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It added that the af­fected of­fice, which is in Block A of Kwong Wai Shiu Hospi­tal (KWSH), is ex­pected to be closed for at least two months for clean­ing and re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>All op­er­a­tions staff will work from home, while af­fected clin­i­cal staff will be re­lo­cated to another of­fice at the HCA head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>“While we are man­ag­ing the dam­age and work­ing to­wards full re­cov­ery of op­er­a­tions caused by this un­for­tu­nate in­ci­dent, our com­mit­ment to serve ter­mi­nally ill pa­tients in their homes re­mains strong,” said chief ex­ec­u­tive of HCA Hos­pice Care An­ge­line Wee.</p>
    <p>The af­fected of­fice is on the third floor of Block A.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force said it was alerted to the fire at about 8.25pm on Tues­day and that the fire was ex­tin­guished us­ing a water jet.</p>
    <p>There were nei­ther any in­juries re­ported nor an evac­u­a­tion or­dered.</p>
    <p>SCDF is still in­ves­ti­gat­ing the cause of the fire.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Tues­day night, KWSH said no one was in the of­fice at the time.</p>
    <p>The hospi­tal’s nurs­ing home res­i­dents are housed in a sep­a­rate block. Its wards have been checked and no res­i­dents were af­fected by the fire, added KWSH.</p>
    <p>Its other op­er­a­tions in Block A, which houses Fre­se­nius Kid­ney Care, Health­way Med­i­cal, Silver Gen­er­a­tion Of­fice @ Kal­lang and the KWSH can­teen, re­sumed their op­er­a­tions on Wed­nes­day.</p>
