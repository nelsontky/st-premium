    <p>Malaysian em­ploy­ers say they need more time to ful­fil new reg­u­la­tions to pro­vide for­eign work­ers with bet­ter ac­com­mo­da­tion amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Min­i­mum Stan­dards of Hous­ing and Ameni­ties Act took ef­fect on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment in March an­nounced that em­ploy­ers must pro­vide ac­com­mo­da­tion for all their work­ers in all sec­tors un­der the Act.</p>
    <p>The new rules re­quire em­ploy­ers to pro­vide ev­ery worker with a sin­gle bed mea­sur­ing not less than 1.7 sq m. Each worker must be given a mat­tress that is at least 10cm thick, a pil­low and a blan­ket.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery worker must have ac­cess to a cup­board with a lock too.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Sham­sud­din Bar­dan said that due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, more time was needed to com­ply with the reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“We need at least one year for the gov­ern­ment to guide em­ploy­ers. They should not put pres­sure on us dur­ing this try­ing pe­riod,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sham­sud­din said spe­cific reg­u­la­tions such as pro­vid­ing thick mat­tresses and cup­boards of spe­cific sizes “will take time”.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has 2.2 mil­lion reg­is­tered for­eign work­ers who are mostly blue-col­lar work­ers, and over two mil­lion more who work in the coun­try il­le­gally.</p>
    <p>How­ever, only some of the reg­is­tered mi­grant work­ers are given hous­ing by their em­ploy­ers, in­clud­ing in rented shop lots and tem­po­rary quar­ters on con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>The rest are left to fend for them­selves, with many shar­ing cramped rented quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Fed­er­a­tion of Malaysian Man­u­fac­tur­ers pres­i­dent Soh Thian Lai has said the RM50,000 (S$16,450) fine for each of­fence was too dras­tic due to the weak­ened econ­omy.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment’s plan would se­verely ham­per the busi­ness re­vival ini­tia­tives of most in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The coun­try yes­ter­day re­ported 62 new cases to bring the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions to 9,459 – its high­est one-day tally in three months.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of deaths from Covid-19 stood at 128.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian econ­omy in the sec­ond quar­ter shrunk by the most since the 1998 Asian eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
