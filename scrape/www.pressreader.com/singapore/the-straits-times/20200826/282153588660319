    <p>NEW YORK • For­get merger Monday. The start to this week in­stead saw a flurry of com­pa­nies file to go public as uni­corns gal­lop to mar­ket, wak­ing up what is usu­ally a sleepy end to the US sum­mer sea­son.</p>
    <p>Five com­pa­nies joined the rush: Unity Soft­ware, Sumo Logic, Jfrog, Snowflake and, fil­ing for a di­rect list­ing in­stead of a tra­di­tional ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO), Asana.</p>
    <p>All of them filed with the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Commission, re­veal­ing their fi­nan­cial re­sults for the first time.</p>
    <p>Also fil­ing on Monday were fi­nan­cial ad­viser StepS­tone Group and at least four biomed­i­cal com­pa­nies, a telemedici­ne provider and four blank-cheque com­pa­nies, one of them led by Mr Paul Ryan, the Wis­con­sin Repub­li­can who was Speaker of the House.</p>
    <p>A blank-cheque com­pany is a de­vel­op­men­tal stage com­pany that has no es­tab­lished busi­ness plan. It may be used to gather funds as a start-up or, more likely, it has the in­tent to merge or ac­quire an­other busi­ness en­tity.</p>
    <p>While in­vestors and deal-mak­ers have tra­di­tion­ally as­so­ci­ated Monday with ac­qui­si­tion an­nounce­ments, the vol­ume of those deals has sunk this year with travel re­stricted be­cause of the coronaviru­s pan­demic and fi­nanciers wary of new sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Equity is­suance, on the other hand, has sprung back from an ini­tial pan­demic-in­duced lull with a vengeance, with spe­cial pur­pose ac­qui­si­tion com­pa­nies, or Spacs, lead­ing the charge. Last month, with al­most US$19 bil­lion (S$26 bil­lion) in new list­ings, was the busiest month for US IPOs since Septem­ber 2014, when 36 com­pa­nies went public rais­ing US$33 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to data com­plied by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>IPO vol­ume, in­clud­ing Spacs, in usu­ally lan­guid Au­gust topped US$16 bil­lion as of Monday, the data shows. The three high­est sum­mer months on record were June, last month and this month.</p>
    <p>Soft­ware com­pa­nies have been a small yet lu­cra­tive seg­ment for US IPO in­vestors. This year, 18 of them have gone public rais­ing a com­bined US$5.5 bil­lion. They were up 91 per cent from their of­fer prices through Monday, based on a weighted av­er­age, com­pared with the 53 per cent in­crease for the 125 list­ings over­all, ex­clud­ing Spacs.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors are seek­ing to de­ploy cap­i­tal where there is a high rate of growth and a dura­bil­ity to that growth,” said Mor­gan Stan­ley’s co­head of tech­nol­ogy equity cap­i­tal mar­kets for the Amer­i­cas Ash­ley</p>
    <p>MacNeill. “This is the busiest sum­mer, bar none.”</p>
    <p>Asana filed for what could be this year’s first di­rect list­ing. The al­ter­na­tive route to a list­ing of­fers com­pa­nies a way to go public with­out is­su­ing new shares to raise cap­i­tal, while usu­ally pro­vid­ing in­vestors a chance to sell their hold­ings with­out wait­ing for a lock-up pe­riod to ex­pire.</p>
    <p>Asana is the first com­pany to file for a di­rect list­ing since Slack Tech­nolo­gies used it last year. Palan­tir Tech­nolo­gies, which said it is plan­ning a slightly mod­i­fied ver­sion of a di­rect list­ing, may be close be­hind.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive Net­work Part­ner­ing, with Mr Ryan as chair­man, seeks to raise US$300 mil­lion in a list­ing.</p>
    <p>Al­most two in five IPOs this year has been a Spac, Bloomberg’s data shows, mak­ing the once un­com­mon list­ings a driv­ing force in merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Monday’s big­gest deal was the ac­qui­si­tion of driver­less car start-up Lu­mi­nar Tech­nolo­gies, backed by tech bil­lion­aire Peter Thiel. Lu­mi­nar an­nounced on Monday morn­ing that it was go­ing public via a merger with Mr Alec Gores’ blank-cheque firm Gores Metropou­los. Mr Thiel is also a co-founder of Palan­tir.</p>
    <p>In all, 112 com­pa­nies have an­nounced list­ings on US ex­changes this year that are cur­rently pend­ing, ac­cord­ing to the data com­piled by Bloomberg. They in­clude com­pa­nies such as Cor­sair Gam­ing and Chi­nese elec­tric-ve­hi­cle maker XPeng.</p>
