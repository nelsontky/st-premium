    <p>The Mazda 3 (from $97,888) wins hands down in this seg­ment. Its mix of su­perb build qual­ity, el­e­gant styling and thought­ful pack­ag­ing makes it the most com­pelling com­pact saloon you can buy. While it may ap­pear mod­estly en­dowed in the power depart­ment, its en­gine is will­ing and re­fined. Like in the 318i, this makes hard revving an easy thing to do.</p>
    <p>The Toy­ota Corolla Altis may seem bor­ing be­cause of its sheer pop­u­la­tion. But if you are look­ing for an all-rounder with de­pend­abil­ity, it is still the gold stan­dard. The Hy­brid ($121,888, left above) is the best pick as it of­fers the best ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Else­where, noth­ing stands out from the crowd like the Hyundai Avante (from $99,999 for S vari­ant), the sec­ond run­ner-up in this year’s ST Car of the Year awards. The new Avante is strik­ingly hand­some, if a tad fas­tid­i­ous. Its in­te­rior is im­pres­sively laid out, with a suite of dig­i­tal in­stru­men­ta­tion and well-tai­lored trim. It has plenty of mod­ern driv­ing aids too.</p>
    <p>The bud­get pick in this group­ing has to be the (from $93,999, left). The new City is a perkier drive than its pre­de­ces­sor, sub­stan­tially more youth­ful in its styling and packs enough mod­ern fea­tures to please young drivers.</p>
