    <p>NEW YORK • For years, sleep ex­perts have held one piece of com­mon wis­dom above all else: that de­vices have no place in the bed­room.</p>
    <p>Yet, since the Covid-19 pan­demic be­gan in March, mil­lions of Amer­i­cans have de­fied that guid­ance and be­gun work­ing pre­cisely where they sleep. They are draft­ing le­gal doc­u­ments, pro­duc­ing events, hold­ing client calls, cod­ing, e-mail­ing, study­ing and writ­ing, all from un­der the cov­ers.</p>
    <p>This was not al­ways the plan. Early on, many of them in­vested in desks and other equip­ment meant to make their homes as er­gonom­i­cally sound and of­fice-like as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>When New York City shut down in March, Ms Vanessa An­der­son, 24, set up a small desk for her­self in her liv­ing room. She was work­ing for an agency that man­ages pri­vate chefs and wanted to keep some sem­blance of sep­a­ra­tion be­tween work and sleep.</p>
    <p>“For a while I was re­ally com­mit­ted to not work­ing from my bed­room at all,” she said. In May, she moved her desk into her bed­room for more light. “My bed was just sit­ting there, taunt­ing me.”</p>
    <p>She set ground rules for her­self: She would get in bed only af­ter 2pm, but that start time shifted ear­lier and ear­lier. Come July, her bed had be­come her full-time of­fice.</p>
    <p>Ms An­der­son has since switched jobs – she works in e-com­merce for a spice shop now – and works re­motely only part of the week, but still from bed. Talk­ing to oth­ers, she has dis­cov­ered how com­mon­place the prac­tice is.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been on calls with peo­ple where we were both in bed. At the end of the call, it’s like, ‘How’s the pan­demic go­ing? Oh, you’re in bed right now, too? So am I.’ ”</p>
    <p>Work­ing from bed is a time-hon­oured tra­di­tion up­held by some of his­tory’s most ac­com­plished fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Frida Kahlo painted mas­ter­pieces from her canopy bed.</p>
    <p>For­mer Bri­tish prime min­is­ter Win­ston Churchill, a no­to­ri­ous late riser even dur­ing World War II, dic­tated to typ­ists while hav­ing break­fast in bed.</p>
    <p>Edith Whar­ton, Wil­liam Wordsworth and Mar­cel Proust drafted prose and verse from their beds. “I am a com­pletely hor­i­zon­tal author,” Tru­man Capote told The Paris Re­view in 1957. “I can’t think un­less I’m ly­ing down.”</p>
    <p>Along with fu­elling cre­ative think­ing, the bed­room can be a refuge from the chaos of home life.</p>
    <p>Par­ents re­treat there to hide from their home-bound chil­dren. Oth­ers are flee­ing room­mates.</p>
    <p>“I think one of the things we’re learn­ing is that we’re all in tight places fig­u­ra­tively and lit­er­ally, and es­pe­cially if you have a room­mate or spouse, there just isn’t enough real es­tate in your home to have the pri­vacy to get your work done,” said singer and song­writer Sam Stephens, 35, in Nashville, Ten­nessee.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from bed may also be symp­to­matic of col­lec­tive malaise.</p>
    <p>“I spend way more time work­ing from bed even though I have a com­puter, of­fice chair and desk,” said YouTu­ber Abe­lina Rios, 26, in Los An­ge­les. “I think ev­ery­body is feel­ing de­pressed from the pan­demic, and when you’re de­pressed, one of the harder things to do is to get out of bed.”</p>
    <p>Ms Liz Fosslien, 33, author of No Hard Feel­ings, a book about how emo­tions af­fect work, brings her com­puter into bed with her ev­ery morning, wire­less mouse and all. “I use my mat­tress as a mouse pad,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her ad­vice to any­one do­ing the same these days is: “Don’t beat your­self up for it. It is easy to be like, ‘Ugh I’m in my py­ja­mas, I haven’t washed my hair, what am I do­ing’, but it’s re­ally about the qual­ity of your out­put.”</p>
    <p>A pri­mary ar­gu­ment against us­ing de­vices in bed is that it can fur­ther erode the bound­aries be­tween work and home, and dis­rupt your sleep cy­cle.</p>
    <p>But even Ms Ari­anna Huff­in­g­ton, me­dia ex­ec­u­tive turned sleep evan­ge­list, has found her­self work­ing from bed since the pan­demic hit. “I think it can work great for peo­ple, but it’s crit­i­cal to have cer­tain bound­aries,” she said.</p>
    <p>She sug­gests keep­ing your night­stand clear of clut­ter and en­sur­ing that you have a hard stop on work hours where you get out of bed and store your elec­tron­ics in another room.</p>
    <p>“I highly rec­om­mend a real tran­si­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I have a hot shower and bath to wash away the day, change what I’m wear­ing, have a dif­fer­ent Tshirt for sleep. I love beau­ti­ful lin­gerie. It makes you feel like, ‘Hey, you’re go­ing to sleep’.”</p>
    <p>Pro­po­nents of desk cul­ture have ar­gued that there is no way some­one can be pro­duc­tive from bed.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know any­one who works ac­tu­ally in a prone po­si­tion, but I know tonnes of peo­ple who work in bed (my hus­band, for in­stance). I think they’re all a bunch of lazy, bed­sore-prone, rapidly de­te­ri­o­rat­ing slobs,” writer Su­san Or­lean told The New Repub­lic in 2013.</p>
    <p>“Or maybe they’re much, much hap­pier (and smarter) than the rest of us.”</p>
    <p>But what many home-bound work­ers are real­is­ing dur­ing the pan­demic is some­thing chron­i­cally ill and dis­abled peo­ple have known for years: that work­ing from bed does not mean you are lazy or de­pressed.</p>
    <p>In fact, it is per­fectly pos­si­ble to hold down a job re­motely from bed, pro­vided your em­ployer is flex­i­ble about re­mote work.</p>
    <p>“We have data show­ing time craft­ing is good for hap­pi­ness, if you’re able to work from any­where and you choose to work from bed, this is one ex­am­ple of time craft­ing,” said Har­vard Busi­ness School As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ash­ley Whillans. “Pick­ing where to work and how to get work done can im­prove em­ployee sat­is­fac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tessa Miller, 32, author of the book What Doesn’t Kill You, about her strug­gles with chronic ill­ness, has been work­ing from bed since she was di­ag­nosed with Crohn’s dis­ease at age 23.</p>
    <p>“I think that the pan­demic is high­light­ing all these things that chron­i­cally ill and dis­abled peo­ple have been do­ing for a long time, and now ev­ery­one is do­ing them as well and work­ing from bed is one of them,” she said. “I know a lot of highly pro­duc­tive, in­tel­li­gent, tal­ented peo­ple who have to work from bed as a ne­ces­sity.”</p>
    <p>Those with chronic ill­ness or dis­abil­i­ties say they hope that, much as the way the pan­demic has made com­pa­nies more open to re­mote work, the stigma around work­ing from bed will also be bro­ken.</p>
    <p>“I hope one of the things that comes out of this is it re­veals you can still do good work from your bed, or bath­tub, or liv­ing room sofa with a heat­ing pad, and I hope that will cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple who are chron­i­cally ill or dis­abled in fields they maybe didn’t feel wel­come in be­fore,” Ms Miller said.</p>
    <p>We have data show­ing time craft­ing is good for hap­pi­ness, if you’re able to work from any­where and you choose to work from bed, this is one ex­am­ple of time craft­ing. Pick­ing where to work and how to get work done can im­prove em­ployee sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
