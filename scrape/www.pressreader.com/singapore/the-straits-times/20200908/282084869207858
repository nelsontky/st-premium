    <p>I thank Mr Foo Sing Kheng for tak­ing the time to ex­press his views in his Fo­rum let­ter (Tak­ing up 2 jobs does not en­sure job se­cu­rity, Sept 5).</p>
    <p>First, I agree that low-in­come work­ers should re­ceive more help.</p>
    <p>With re­spect to my speech in Par­lia­ment, there were ref­er­ences made that were taken out of con­text.</p>
    <p>The full text of my speech would show un­equiv­o­cally that the thrust was that of di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion for both the in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies in or­der to build re­silience to bet­ter with­stand fu­ture shocks.</p>
    <p>Re­silience could be built when in­di­vid­u­als who would like to ap­ply their mul­ti­ple skill sets are given the op­por­tu­nity to do so, by be­ing given more than one role within the com­pany (this refers to work that ap­plies the many skills one has and not two jobs), or in a sec­ond job.</p>
    <p>This would en­able work­ers to de­velop a broader set of skills that would al­low flex­i­bil­ity in career switches within a shorter win­dow of time.</p>
    <p>I said the rel­e­vant labour reg­u­la­tions should pro­tect work­ers from be­ing over­worked and also reg­u­late po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­ests. I also men­tioned that this ap­proach may not suit cer­tain jobs or ap­peal to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>My in­ten­tion was to en­cour­age in­di­vid­u­als to ap­ply life­long learn­ing to achieve career adapt­abil­ity and sus­tain­abil­ity for job se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness land­scape will likely be in­creas­ingly volatile with shorter job cy­cles and re­duced mar­ket pre­dictabil­ity.</p>
    <p>There­fore, fo­cus­ing on build­ing re­silience is crit­i­cal for both com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Re­silience could be built when in­di­vid­u­als who would like to ap­ply their mul­ti­ple skill sets are given the op­por­tu­nity to do so, by be­ing given more than one role within the com­pany (this refers to work that ap­plies the many skills one has and not two jobs), or in a sec­ond job.</p>
