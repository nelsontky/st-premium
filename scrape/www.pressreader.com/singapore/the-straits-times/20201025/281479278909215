    <p>Sight of SIA cabin crew board­ing ‘restau­rant’ planes, lug­gage in tow, draws ap­plause from din­ers, who are treated to the com­plete in-flight ex­pe­ri­ence</p>
    <p>For the first time since air traf­fic was mostly grounded by the Covid-19 pandemic in March, a pal­pa­ble buzz was ev­i­dent in a sec­tion of Ter­mi­nal 3 at Changi Air­port when SIA’s Restau­rant A380@Changi opened for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Within the tran­sit area, there were chil­dren, some of them dressed in mini sarong ke­bayas, run­ning about and play­ing.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers streamed through the en­trance usu­ally re­served for first­class pas­sen­gers, trad­ing in their pass­ports for a card that in­di­cated seat num­bers.</p>
    <p>Air­port se­cu­rity crew were hard at work, screen­ing the con­stant stream of peo­ple be­fore the board­ing area. Those who had bot­tled wa­ter were po­litely asked to empty them, while those who had lap­tops were asked to take them out at the X-ray scan­ning ma­chines.</p>
    <p>Like a nor­mal flight, dozens of cabin crew from Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), with the ste­wardesses don­ning the car­rier’s sig­na­ture sarong ke­baya, soon ar­rived to board two wait­ing Air­bus A-380 planes, with lug­gage in tow.</p>
    <p>The scene drew ap­plause from about 400 cus­tomers who were wait­ing to board the planes. They were also treated to a mini fash­ion show put up by other cabin crew who mod­elled SIA uni­forms from the past.</p>
    <p>Af­ter board­ing the planes, the cus­tomers – spread across econ­omy, pre­mium econ­omy, busi­ness class and the suites – plugged into in­flight en­ter­tain­ment. At the same time, cabin crew went down the aisles to serve food and drinks.</p>
    <p>But, in a stark re­minder of the times, both crew and pas­sen­gers were wear­ing masks when­ever pos­si­ble. Gaps were left be­tween seats to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing, and each plane was filled to only about half of its usual ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The planes did not take off, as the crew went about serv­ing the cus­tomers for three hours as SIA launched its first Restau­rant A380 ex­pe­ri­ence at Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>The air­line of­fered an ini­tial 900 or so seats for lunch on Oct 24 and 25, and th­ese were sold out within 30 min­utes af­ter book­ings opened.</p>
    <p>SIA then an­nounced that it would have lunch sessions as well on Oct 31 and Nov 1, and din­ner sessions on all four days. The three­hour lunches and din­ners cost $50 per per­son in the econ­omy cabin, $90 for those in pre­mium econ­omy, $300 for busi­ness class and $600 for the suites.</p>
    <p>Al­most 200 SIA staff in­clud­ing cabin crew vol­un­teered to help out at the event yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Lik Hsin, SIA’s ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent (com­mer­cial), who spoke to the me­dia on the side­lines, said: “We are very, very grate­ful for the sup­port that has been shown to us by the peo­ple of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This week­end is all sold out, but there are still some slots avail­able for the next week­end... if the de­mand con­tin­ues to be strong, cer­tainly (open­ing up more din­ing sessions) will be some­thing we will think about.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said there has also been strong in­ter­est in SIA’s other new non-flight ini­tia­tive, which is the of­fer of de­liv­ery of its pre­mium meals, with more than 500 pack­ages sold so far.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion on how th­ese ini­tia­tives have helped SIA fi­nan­cially, he said: “All th­ese are rev­enue gen­er­at­ing, but we are an air­line and we do have to get back to fly­ing. So we do hope to be able to do that as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>But, for now, the op­por­tu­nity to</p>
    <p>dine on board a plane is as good as it gets for those hit with the travel bug.</p>
    <p>Pro­cure­ment spe­cial­ist Halim Rah­man cel­e­brated his 37th birth­day on board the plane yes­ter­day with a meal in the busi­ness-class cabin.</p>
    <p>He had waited un­til mid­night for reg­is­tra­tion to open on­line ear­lier this month, and even­tu­ally suc­ceeded in re­serv­ing slots for him­self and his best friend, se­nior prod­uct ex­ec­u­tive Fairus Ah­mad, 38.</p>
    <p>“It’s def­i­nitely about the ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Mr Halim.</p>
    <p>“I know the price is steep for a din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence... but since we are not go­ing any­where, this will be some­thing that is mem­o­rable.”</p>
    <p>Re­tired civil ser­vant Emily Loo, 68, who was in econ­omy class with her hus­band at Restau­rant A380, said: “We man­aged to see the suites sec­tion to­day, which was very im­pres­sive, and we also got to see the cock­pit and take a photo with the pi­lots.</p>
    <p>“We had wanted to travel to Tai­wan and Hong Kong, but this ex­pe­ri­ence does help to make up for not be­ing able to do so.”</p>
    <p>MEM­O­RABLE EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>I know the price is steep for a din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence... but since we are not go­ing any­where, this will be some­thing that is mem­o­rable.</p>
