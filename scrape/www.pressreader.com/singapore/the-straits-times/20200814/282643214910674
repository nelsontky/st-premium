    <p>FAM­I­LIES TORN APART: Strict bor­der con­trols brought on by the coro­n­avirus have sep­a­rated many fam­i­lies, in­clud­ing those of celebri­ties.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese busi­ness­man Wang Xiaofei, who is mar­ried to Tai­wanese ac­tress Bar­bie Hsu, re­cently ex­pressed his anx­i­ety and distress at not be­ing able to see his fam­ily. The cou­ple have two chil­dren – daugh­ter Hsi-yueh, six, and son Hsi-lin, four.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang is based in Bei­jing, while Hsu is in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>At about 2am yesterday, Mr Wang wrote on Weibo that he missed his daugh­ter. “Dear baby, daddy re­ally misses you. Due to the pan­demic, daddy was able to be with you ev­ery day for six months and watch you grow.</p>
    <p>“But also due to the pan­demic, daddy has not seen you for al­most two months after I re­turned to work. I don’t know how much you would have grown when we meet again.”</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old busi­ness­man put up four pho­tos with the post, in­clud­ing two of him with Hsi-yueh (right, above).</p>
    <p>He wrote an­other post at about 3.30am ded­i­cated to his wife. “Beau­ti­ful Bar­bie Hsu mar­ried me 10 years ago. How can I re­pay her? Per­haps per­fec­tion does not mat­ter, and it is some­thing you stum­ble upon by chance.”</p>
    <p>He ac­com­pa­nied the post – which was later deleted – with two of their wed­ding pho­tos (left) taken in 2010.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ne­ti­zens com­mended him for miss­ing his wife and daugh­ter, but they won­dered why he made no men­tion of his son. They noted that he has posted many pho­tos of Hsi-yueh on Weibo, but only a few of Hsi-lin.</p>
    <p>His good friend, ac­tor Qin Hao, said on a re­al­ity show last month Mr Wang adores his daugh­ter, but is very strict with his son.</p>
    <p>Hsu, 43, has not re­acted to Mr Wang’s posts, which came after Tai­wan’s Mir­ror Me­dia re­ported on Wed­nes­day the cou­ple earned 20 mil­lion yuan (S$3.9 mil­lion) for tak­ing part in one sea­son of a re­al­ity show.</p>
    <p>Hsu, who is best known for play­ing Shan­cai in hit Tai­wanese idol dra­mas Me­teor Gar­den (2001) and Me­teor Gar­den 2 (2002), has not acted in any TV se­ri­als or movies since her roles in movies Mo­tor­way and Mil­lion Dol­lar Crocodile in 2012.</p>
