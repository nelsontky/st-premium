    <p>Ap­peal­ing to the heart and the head, a tour de force of a speech by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was met with an im­pas­sioned re­sponse from Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh, the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>PM Lee’s 90-minute speech spanned ev­ery­thing from how the Covid-19 pan­demic un­folded and for­eign man­power poli­cies, to the arc of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory and the changed po­lit­i­cal land­scape to­day.</p>
    <p>Amid an on­go­ing de­bate about re­view­ing poli­cies, he ac­knowl­edged some of the Gov­ern­ment’s short­com­ings in han­dling the pan­demic, and how its po­si­tion on so­cial safety nets has to change. It was a can­did ad­mis­sion by the PM, whom many Sin­ga­pore­ans have come to ex­pect noth­ing but di­rect­ness and hon­esty.</p>
    <p>But per­fect de­ci­sions, as PM Lee ex­plained, are not al­ways pos­si­ble to make in the fog of war.</p>
    <p>“Yet we have to de­cide and move.</p>
    <p>We can­not af­ford to wait. The key is to watch things closely, learn from ex­pe­ri­ence, and adapt our re­sponses promptly as new in­for­ma­tion emerges and the sit­u­a­tion changes.”</p>
    <p>But even amid de­bate about change, there are fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ples that must re­main, one of which is fis­cal pru­dence.</p>
    <p>That means so­cial safety nets should be paid for out of cur­rent rev­enues, and should not draw down on what has been in­her­ited – nor mort­gaged on the fu­ture of one’s de­scen­dants.</p>
    <p>Segue­ing into the op­po­si­tion’s po­si­tion on the mat­ter, PM Lee said: “Now the op­po­si­tion says,</p>
    <p>show me how much we have in our re­serves, be­fore I de­cide whether to sup­port your Bud­get and tax plans.”</p>
    <p>He called it the at­ti­tude of in­her­i­tors who think they have come into a for­tune, and want to con­sume the fruits of their pre­de­ces­sors’ labours.</p>
    <p>“This is fun­da­men­tally the wrong ap­proach,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh rose later to re­spond, and to set the record straight. Vis­i­bly emo­tional, he said: “We are not talk­ing about raid­ing (the re­serves). It’s about slow­ing the growth slope of the re­serves so the prin­ci­pal is not touched.</p>
    <p>“The ar­gu­ment can­not be that when the op­po­si­tion tries to put</p>
    <p>that pro­posal for­ward, some­how we are en­gag­ing in some sort of chi­canery to steal what pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions have toiled and per­spired to bring us here.</p>
    <p>“When an is­sue isn’t framed ac­cu­rately, and the op­po­si­tion is made to look like char­la­tans, surely we have to stand up and say ‘No, that’s not the agenda’.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh has pre­vi­ously pushed for the 50 per cent cap on the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns Con­tri­bu­tion to be raised tem­po­rar­ily.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns frame­work, the Gov­ern­ment can spend up to 50 per cent of the long-term ex­pected real re­turns, in­clud­ing cap­i­tal gains, on rel­e­vant as­sets.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond point he took is­sue with was PM Lee’s anec­dote about a mid­dle-aged lady, who was told by friends that it was all right to vote tac­ti­cally for the op­po­si­tion as the Gov­ern­ment will still be in charge.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh asked the House to look at the sit­u­a­tion from a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive: “Why is it that when new cit­i­zens go to the com­mu­nity cen­tre, the elected MP is not there?</p>
    <p>“Is the elected MP who is an op­po­si­tion can­di­date not part of this larger po­lit­i­cal fir­ma­ment?</p>
    <p>“(It may be) poor un­der­stand­ing – call it what you want of the sit­u­a­tion – (but) peo­ple (are) feel­ing that there’s some­thing in­her­ently un­fair.</p>
    <p>“And so when they say, ‘I want the PAP in gov­ern­ment, but I also want an op­po­si­tion’, they are giv­ing voice to the sit­u­a­tion many Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­tu­ally feel, which is we want an op­po­si­tion in this House.”</p>
    <p>His re­sponse yes­ter­day was a cri de coeur – a heart­felt ap­peal or protest – that sits on the same wave­length as those Sin­ga­pore­ans who are fear­ful and anx­ious for their jobs, and who feel a deep sense of in­jus­tice over the cards that life has dealt them.</p>
    <p>PM Lee stressed that he did not un­der-value Mr Singh’s mo­ti­va­tions, his pas­sion or his de­sire to do right by Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the is­sue of re­serves, he clar­i­fied that he was not ar­gu­ing on the tech­ni­cal­i­ties of per­cent­ages and draw­downs, but on first prin­ci­ples: “Our mind­set should be, what is a rainy day fund... We thought this over care­fully, we de­bated this in the House, we agreed upon a rule which we felt was a fair dis­tri­bu­tion between the present and fu­ture gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Our fun­da­men­tal mind­set should be we pay our way for­ward and do not de­pend on an­other lit­tle bit from the re­serves... We should be think­ing for the fu­ture, for the next gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“That’s the mind­set which has brought us here, and that’s the mind­set which will serve our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren well.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing up Mr Singh’s point, and elab­o­rat­ing on why tac­ti­cal vot­ing is the wrong thing to teach peo­ple to do, he said: “If you just be­come a free-rider and you vote op­po­si­tion (be­cause) ‘no harm, the PAP will still be there’, the sys­tem must fail.</p>
    <p>“The sys­tem can only work if peo­ple vote sin­cerely, hon­estly, in ac­cor­dance with what they re­ally want, and to pro­duce a re­sult which matches their true in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>“And if they vote tac­ti­cally, the con­se­quence must be that one day, they will get the re­sult which they mark the ‘X’ for, but which they did not in­tend.”</p>
    <p>As for those who think the Gov­ern­ment is heavy-handed, PM Lee said that on ma­jor is­sues con­cern­ing the fun­da­men­tal in­ter­ests of the coun­try, it can­not wait pas­sively for a con­sen­sus to form, but must make a de­ci­sion and take re­spon­si­bil­ity for it.</p>
    <p>This is the cross the rul­ing party must bear – not be­cause it does not have a heart, but be­cause it must keep the coun­try go­ing.</p>
    <p>The Prime Minister may have ex­horted MPs to “raise their game” yes­ter­day, but it was he who gave a mas­ter­class on what rais­ing this bar looks like.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh, too, rose to the oc­ca­sion, in his first en­counter as the new Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>One hopes that mem­bers of the House can take a leaf from their book, and be braver, bolder and sharper in their speeches and re­sponses.</p>
    <p>Can they cut through the jar­gon and mar­shal the rel­e­vant data? Or, as PM Lee said, “the truths are the same, but the pre­sen­ta­tion has to change with the zeit­geist” – mean­ing the spirit of the times.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion, too, must be held to higher standards, and not be al­lowed to con­ve­niently bat away calls to pro­pose al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>As both sides gear up for the de­bates to come, they may wish to bear in mind PM Lee’s sober­ing part­ing shot: “We all hope that di­ver­sity will make a hun­dred flow­ers bloom. But how do we pre­vent di­ver­sity from pro­duc­ing po­lar­i­sa­tion?”</p>
    <p>If pol­i­tics be­comes toxic and bit­ter, he said, the coun­try will be di­vided and go into a down­ward spi­ral: “If this hap­pens to Sin­ga­pore, we will not just cease be­ing an ex­cep­tional na­tion. It will be the end of us.”</p>
