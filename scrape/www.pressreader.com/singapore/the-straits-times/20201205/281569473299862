    <p>Sin­ga­pore will have four dig­i­tal banks that en­able cus­tomers to tap a greater va­ri­ety of bank­ing op­tions from early 2022. The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) yes­ter­day awarded dig­i­tal full bank li­cences to the Grab-Singtel con­sor­tium and tech gi­ant Sea. Like tra­di­tional banks, these play­ers will pro­vide re­tail cus­tomers ser­vices such as open­ing ac­counts, de­posits and debit and credit cards.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will have four dig­i­tal banks that en­able cus­tomers to tap a greater va­ri­ety of bank­ing op­tions from early 2022.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) yes­ter­day awarded dig­i­tal full bank li­cences to the Grab-Singtel con­sor­tium and tech­nol­ogy gi­ant Sea.</p>
    <p>Like tra­di­tional banks, they will of­fer re­tail cus­tomers ser­vices such as open­ing ac­counts, de­posits as well as debit and credit cards. But they will not have a phys­i­cal pres­ence and all bank­ing ser­vices will be done on­line. Dig­i­tal full banks can also serve cor­po­rate cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank will also grant dig­i­tal whole­sale bank (DWB) li­cences to Alibaba founder Jack Ma’s Ant Group as well as a con­sor­tium com­pris­ing Green­land Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings, Lin­kl­o­gis Hong Kong and Beijing Co-op­er­a­tive Eq­uity In­vest­ment Fund Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Green­land Fi­nan­cial is the in­vest­ment arm of Chi­nese real es­tate de­vel­oper and state-owned en­ter­prise Green­land Group, while Lin­kl­o­gis Hong Kong is a sup­ply chain fi­nanc­ing firm.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal whole­sale banks can serve cor­po­rates and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs).</p>
    <p>Twenty-one ap­pli­ca­tions for the dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cences were sub­mit­ted, of which 14 were short­listed ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The four suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants, who are ex­pected to start busi­ness from early 2022, beat con­tenders such as Razer Youth Bank and a con­sor­tium led by Osim founder Ron Sim’s V3 Group and EZ-Link.</p>
    <p>MAS chief Ravi Menon said the cen­tral bank ap­plied a “rig­or­ous, merit-based process to se­lect a strong slate of dig­i­tal banks”.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect them to thrive along­side the in­cum­bent banks and raise the in­dus­try’s bar in de­liv­er­ing qual­ity fi­nan­cial ser­vices, par­tic­u­larly for cur­rently un­der­served busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als,” he said.</p>
    <p>Suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants must meet rel­e­vant con­di­tions be­fore they get the li­cences. MAS will also re­view whether to grant more dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­cences in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuen Kuan Moon, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer-des­ig­nate of Singtel, said that with Singtel and Grab’s com­bined dig­i­tal ex­per­tise and customer knowl­edge, the con­sor­tium is well-placed to im­prove bank­ing ser­vices for con­sumers and en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Mr For­rest Li, chair­man and group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Sea, said the com­pany looks for­ward to “fur­ther con­tribut­ing to the long-term de­vel­op­ment of our na­tion’s dig­i­tal econ­omy, cre­at­ing more em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore and em­pow­er­ing our whole com­mu­nity to thrive in the dig­i­tal era”. The tech gi­ant owns ecom­merce plat­form Shopee, game de­vel­oper Garena and dig­i­tal pay­ments arm SeaMoney.</p>
    <p>Ant Group, which will be is­sued a DWB li­cence, said it would seek to make fi­nan­cial ser­vices more ac­ces­si­ble for SMEs while sup­port­ing local tal­ent de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In­cum­bent play­ers such as DBS, OCBC and UOB also con­grat­u­lated the suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not alone in its dig­i­tal bank­ing push. Hong Kong is­sued four more vir­tual bank li­cences in May last year, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of such li­cences to eight. The win­ners in­cluded Ant SME Ser­vices, a unit of Ant Group, and a Xiaomi-AMTD Group ven­ture called In­sight Fin­tech HK.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries such as the Philip­pines, China, Ja­pan and South Korea also have vir­tual banks.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal banks will trans­form Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial land­scape and ben­e­fit all stake­hold­ers, ex­perts said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They will ac­cel­er­ate the city state’s ad­vance to­wards its am­bi­tion of be­com­ing a smart na­tion and be of help to ev­ery­one from de­pos­i­tors to savers, bor­row­ers and in­vestors, in­dus­try spe­cial­ists told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>They said low-in­come earn­ers and small busi­nesses will prob­a­bly ben­e­fit the most as dig­i­tal banks, un­en­cum­bered by the cost pres­sures of a brick-and-mor­tar pres­ence, will be able to of­fer cheaper loans and higher re­turns on de­posits.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Nai Seng, reg­u­la­tory risk leader at con­sul­tants Deloitte South-east Asia, said the award of dig­i­tal bank li­cences is a key mile­stone in the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s plan to de­velop a smart fi­nan­cial cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket will be watch­ing closely in the com­ing months as the dig­i­tal banks an­nounce their vi­sions of how they will serve Sin­ga­pore cus­tomers,” he said.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal banks are likely to com­mence op­er­a­tions from early 2022, af­ter meet­ing all rel­e­vant pru­den­tial re­quire­ments and li­cens­ing pre­con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said they will also need to con­tend with an un­cer­tain eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment, low in­ter­est rates and com­pet­i­tive re­sponses from the in­cum­bent banks and other fi­nan­cial ser­vices play­ers.</p>
    <p>The Grab-Singtel con­sor­tium, one of the win­ners of a dig­i­tal full bank (DFB) li­cence, was the strong­est con­tender among the ap­pli­cants, given that both the com­pa­nies are well cap­i­talised and have a sub­stan­tial foot­print in the South-east Asia re­gion, said Pro­fes­sor Foo Maw Der of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Nanyang Busi­ness School.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based Sea, owner of Shopee, has a sub­stan­tial e-com­merce pres­ence in the re­gion and has al­ready started to pro­vide some fin­tech ser­vices, said Prof Foo.</p>
    <p>Mr Varun Mit­tal, Ernst & Young’s global emerg­ing mar­kets fin­tech leader, said the MAS had cho­sen not to break with the norm when it awarded DFB li­cences to Sin­ga­porean en­ti­ties and dig­i­tal whole­sale bank­ing (DWB) li­cences to for­eign con­tenders. These are Ant Group and a con­sor­tium com­pris­ing Green­land Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings Group, Lin­kl­o­gis Hong Kong and Beijing Co-op­er­a­tive Eq­uity In­vest­ment Fund Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>He said that at present, there are 99 banks in Sin­ga­pore’s whole­sale bank­ing in­dus­try and, ex­clud­ing the three local banks, they are all for­eign.</p>
    <p>But dig­i­tal banks will change a lot of things, said Mr Mit­tal. They gen­er­ally pro­vide their ser­vices from a sin­gle plat­form, avail­able to ev­ery­one who owns a mo­bile phone. “Dig­i­tal bank­ing will democra­tise the ac­cess and of­fer­ings of fi­nan­cial prod­ucts and ser­vices,” he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Foo said: “We ex­pect dig­i­tal banks to adopt tech­nolo­gies such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to de­ter­mine whether to make a loan and the loan quan­tum. Un­en­cum­bered by legacy sys­tems, dig­i­tal banks should be able to ap­prove loans in a shorter pe­riod of time.”</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor of fi­nance Aurobindo Ghosh of the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness said bring­ing in China’s fin­tech and e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba, the par­ent com­pany of Ant Group, may be a cat­a­lyst for stan­dard­i­s­a­tion and in­ter­op­er­abil­ity in fin­tech ser­vices such as pay­ments. “The Chi­nese com­pa­nies for DWB could po­ten­tially in­crease in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties from China in small and medium en­ter­prises (SMEs) in Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Ghosh said this bodes well for Sin­ga­pore SMEs to tag along with not just the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy, but one of the fastest re­cov­er­ing ma­jor economies since the start of the Covid-19 pan­demic. He said the need for dig­i­tal banks or brick-and-mor­tar banks with a dig­i­tal pres­ence has been deeply felt in the light of the pan­demic world­wide.</p>
    <p>“The fin­tech rev­o­lu­tion that started be­fore the pan­demic has al­ready cre­ated the stage to make the bank­ing ex­pe­ri­ence more cus­tomis­able and per­sonal,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve dig­i­tal banks would be able to pro­vide a customer-ori­en­tated cost-ef­fec­tive so­lu­tion and a wider prod­uct mix for Sin­ga­porean de­pos­i­tors, savers, bor­row­ers and in­vestors for both busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mit­tal of Ernst & Young said that given dig­i­tal banks have fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy in their DNA, they will seek part­ner­ship with local fin­tech firms, which will also be wooed by tra­di­tional banks as they speed up their own dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Foo said that while the tra­di­tional banks have digi­tised many of their of­fer­ings over a num­ber of years, com­pe­ti­tion from dig­i­tal banks will prompt them to re-en­vi­sion the pur­pose of bank branches.</p>
    <p>“Many pre­vi­ously bread-and­but­ter bank­ing trans­ac­tions such as de­posits, with­drawals and money trans­fers would in­creas­ingly move on­line,” he said. How­ever, branches still as­sist in more com­plex and com­pli­cated fi­nan­cial and in­vest­ment trans­ac­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam Kok Weng, fi­nan­cial ser­vices leader at PwC Sin­ga­pore, said some peo­ple still pre­fer a high­touch per­sonal ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“Just as there is a place for tra­di­tional su­per­mar­kets along­side ecom­merce su­per­mar­kets, we can also ex­pect tra­di­tional bank­ing to evolve on their rel­e­vance and ex­pe­ri­ences,” he said. “There will be fewer branches, but tra­di­tional branches would look very dif­fer­ent to what we have now.”</p>
    <p>WIDER AC­CESS</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal bank­ing will democra­tise the ac­cess and of­fer­ings of fi­nan­cial prod­ucts and ser­vices.</p>
