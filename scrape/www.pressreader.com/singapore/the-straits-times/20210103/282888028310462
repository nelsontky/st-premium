    <p>• Manch­ester City will be with­out five play­ers for to­day’s Premier League trip to Chelsea due to pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus tests, Pep Guardi­ola has confirmed, as he de­fended the de­ci­sion to post­pone Mon­day’s clash with Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>City re­vealed there had been four pos­i­tive cases at the club on Christ­mas Day, in­clud­ing for play­ers Kyle Walker and Gabriel Je­sus.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther round of test­ing found three more cases among the City squad on Mon­day, lead­ing to the match be­ing called off just four hours be­fore kick-off.</p>
    <p>“Five play­ers are iso­lat­ing for 10 days,” said Guardi­ola on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Some of them, the first cases that were re­leased, it was four peo­ple – two play­ers – and three more the se­cond time.”</p>
    <p>City have not re­vealed the iden­tity of the other three play­ers to test pos­i­tive – they will also miss Wed­nes­day’s League Cup semi-fi­nal against Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to post­pone the Ever­ton match at­tracted some crit­i­cism as City did have the re­quired 14 fit se­nior play­ers by Premier League rules to ful­fil the fix­ture.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton said they would be seek­ing clar­i­fi­ca­tion from the league au­thor­i­ties on how the post­pone­ment came about. How­ever, Guardi­ola high­lighted the risk of his play­ers pass­ing on the virus to Ever­ton’s squad.</p>
    <p>“What hap­pens if we travel on the coach and more play­ers get it?” he said. “And what would hap­pen if the Ever­ton play­ers got in­fected from us? It was a huge risk.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully the next tests ev­ery­one is neg­a­tive and the peo­ple who are pos­i­tive right now can come back with­out a prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>City’s train­ing ground was tem­po­rar­ily closed but re­opened on Wed­nes­day af­ter no more new cases were de­tected from another round of test­ing.</p>
    <p>Chelsea boss Frank Lam­pard wel­comed plans for to­day’s match to go ahead, but warned there will be fur­ther dis­rup­tion with in­fec­tion rates across Eng­land soar­ing.</p>
    <p>The Premier League an­nounced yes­ter­day that Ful­ham’s trip to Burn­ley to­day has been post­poned due to fresh Covid-19 cases at the Lon­don club. The move comes af­ter Ful­ham’s away game against Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur on Wed­nes­day was also called off due to a “sig­nif­i­cant rise” in pos­i­tive cases within their camp.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom is bat­tling a new vari­ant of the virus and Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son or­dered mil­lions more peo­ple to live un­der the strictest re­stric­tions f rom Thurs­day to curb its spread af­ter case numbers rose sharply in the last two weeks.</p>
    <p>When asked if his play­ers have con­cerns about play­ing, Lam­pard said: “We feel as safe as the gen­eral public. We’re in a pro­tec­tive en­vi­ron­ment. We’re now tested twice a week, which is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>The English­man confirmed that de­fender Reece James has been ruled out with a mus­cle in­jury but winger Hakim Ziyech has re­turned to train­ing af­ter re­cov­er­ing from a ham­string is­sue.</p>
