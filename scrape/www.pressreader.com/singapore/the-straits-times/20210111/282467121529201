    <p>LON­DON • Chelsea and Manch­ester City yes­ter­day both com­fort­ably ad­vanced to the fourth round of the FA Cup but the magic of the com­pe­ti­tion was still alive, as League Two team Craw­ley elim­i­nated Premier League side Leeds.</p>
    <p>The Blues and City made light work of lower-league op­po­si­tion, beat­ing fourth-tier More­cambe and Cham­pi­onship out­fit Birm­ing­ham 4-0 and 3-0 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Leeds, who fielded a strong line-up, in­clud­ing €30 mil­lion (S$48.6 mil­lion) club-record sign­ing Ro­drigo and Eng­land in­ter­na­tional Kalvin Phillips, were stunned 3-0 at Craw­ley.</p>
    <p>Ni­cholas Tsaroulla, Ash­ley Nade­san and Jor­dan Tun­ni­cliffe net­ted at The Peo­ple’s Pen­sion Sta­dium, mean­ing the vis­i­tors, coached by Marcelo Bielsa, have now ex­ited the FA Cup at this stage for the fourth straight year.</p>
    <p>An emotional Tsaroulla, who was on the books of Tot­ten­ham as a young­ster be­fore be­ing re­leased in 2017 ow­ing to the ef­fects of a car crash, said: “It’s crazy. It’s been a long hard road for me with a cou­ple of tough years, but what a mo­ment for me.</p>
    <p>“I sort of lost my­self in the mo­ment, it was all a bit of a blur. But I am buzzing. It’s been tough for me. Any­one can come back from ev­ery­thing and I just hope that I can in­spire some­body else out there.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Eng­land cap­tain Terry Butcher told BBC Ra­dio 5 Live that the way Craw­ley, who are sixth in their divi­sion, played be­lied their sta­tus and they were “a credit to foot­ball”.</p>
    <p>“A clean sheet against a Premier League side is a big feather in their cap for Craw­ley but just to win the game is a big thing for them,” he said.</p>
    <p>For­mer New­cas­tle mid­fielder and pun­dit Jer­maine Je­nas added: “Craw­ley were very com­fort­able and or­gan­ised through­out t he game. It’s a tough one for the Leeds play­ers to deal with but they didn’t de­serve any­thing out of the game.”</p>
    <p>At Stam­ford Bridge, Chelsea put a halt to a poor run of form – four losses in six Premier League games – as Ma­son Mount, scor­ing on his 22nd birth­day, Timo Werner and</p>
    <p>Cal­lum Hud­son-Odoi grabbed the first three goals.</p>
    <p>Werner ended his two-month goal drought, while Kai Havertz, who made his first start in five games, helped to cre­ate his fel­low Ger­many in­ter­na­tional’s strike be­fore net­ting late on as the hosts se­cured their first win in four games in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>At the Eti­had, re­serve goal­keeper Zack St­ef­fen kept his place de­spite reg­u­lar starter Eder­son re­turn­ing after two games out due to a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>Ber­nando Silva nabbed a dou­ble while Phil Fo­den scored the other, en­abling City man­ager Pep Guardiola to take off Kevin de Bruyne, Ruben Dias and Joao Cancelo at the break, and bring­ing on a fur­ther two play­ers in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>The fourth-round draw will be made to­day.</p>
