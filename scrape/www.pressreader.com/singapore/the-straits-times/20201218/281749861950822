    <p>LONDON • Bri­tain’s top court has given the go-ahead to the ex­pan­sion of Heathrow Air­port, al­low­ing the £14 bil­lion (S$25.22 bil­lion) plan to pro­ceed af­ter decades of le­gal bat­tles and po­lit­i­cal wran­gling.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court rul­ing on Wed­nes­day over­turned a pre­vi­ous de­ci­sion that had blocked the plan on en­vi­ron­men­tal grounds.</p>
    <p>Heathrow, Bri­tain’s big­gest air­port, has only two run­ways and is keen to pro­ceed with a third de­spite the plunge in air traf­fic dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic that has seen it lose its crown as the busiest hub in Europe.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has been a vo­cif­er­ous op­po­nent of the ex­pan­sion, which was ap­proved un­der the pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ment. As mayor of London, he said in 2015 he would lie down in front of bull­doz­ers if nec­es­sary to stop work on the third run­way.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s spokesman on Wed­nes­day said the gov­ern­ment would re­spond in due course.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, a court had de­clared the ex­pan­sion un­law­ful, rul­ing in favour of cli­mate change cam­paign­ers. The judge had said that a fail­ure to take into ac­count the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ments on cli­mate change was “legally fa­tal” to the plans.</p>
    <p>But a Supreme Court judge told a vir­tual ses­sion that the gov­ern­ment had taken cli­mate change com­mit­ments into ac­count when de­sign­ing its air­port pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“For these rea­sons, the court unan­i­mously con­cludes that the ap­peal should be al­lowed. The air­ports national pol­icy state­ment is law­ful,” Judge Philip Sales said.</p>
    <p>Since Fe­bru­ary, the avi­a­tion sec­tor has been hit by its worst down­turn, mean­ing Heathrow now has plenty of spare ca­pac­ity, but the air­port said an­other run­way was still vi­tal for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“De­mand for avi­a­tion will re­cover from Covid-19, and the ad­di­tional ca­pac­ity at an ex­panded Heathrow will al­low Bri­tain as a sov­er­eign na­tion to com­pete for trade and win against our ri­vals in France and Ger­many,” said a Heathrow spokesman.</p>
    <p>Heathrow and its sup­port­ers ar­gue that Bri­tain’s de­par­ture from the Euro­pean Union makes ex­pan­sion crit­i­cal to en­sur­ing the coun­try can in­crease trade with the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>The new run­way will not be opened un­til the 2030s, the air­port said. Heathrow is owned by Spain’s Fer­rovial, the Qatar In­vest­ment Au­thor­ity and China In­vest­ment Corp, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son with Heathrow’s two run­ways, Frank­furt has four and Am­s­ter­dam six.</p>
    <p>Pre-Covid-19, Heathrow had no space to add new flights.</p>
    <p>The project has been hotly de­bated in Bri­tain for al­most half a cen­tury. The new run­way was pre­vi­ously ap­proved in 2009 be­fore be­ing scrapped the fol­low­ing year, and then ap­proved again in 2018.</p>
