    <p>My fam­ily mem­bers were among those evac­u­ated dur­ing the fire at Block 138C, Lorong 1A Toa Payoh last Satur­day (300 evac­u­ated as fire breaks out at Toa Payoh block, Aug 30).</p>
    <p>We thank three peo­ple in par­tic­u­lar – Sergeant Ken­neth Toh, Sergeant Heidi Ow and Sergeant Gary Lew – for their pro­fes­sion­al­ism, care, quick think­ing and em­pa­thy dur­ing the whole in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Among those evac­u­ated that day was our son. The evac­u­a­tion process for him was com­pli­cated by his med­i­cal fragility and the com­plex care he needed. He is 12 years old and bedrid­den with mul­ti­ple se­vere dis­abil­i­ties. Weighing 32kg, he re­lies on a ven­ti­la­tor to breathe and a suc­tion ma­chine to clear his air­ways, while seated in his 20kg as­sis­tive buggy.</p>
    <p>The three po­lice of­fi­cers stayed with us out­side our unit the whole time while ra­dio­ing and wait­ing for lift evac­u­a­tion, as well as up­dat­ing us about the de­vel­op­ing sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>They also strate­gised with us on fea­si­ble ways of mov­ing our son safely. When the lift was ac­ces­si­ble only on the lower floors, the of­fi­cers vol­un­teered to carry him down the stair­well.</p>
    <p>Due to their care, our son was de­liv­ered safely into the good hands of the paramedics. Their re­as­sur­ing pres­ence helped us cope with the har­row­ing ex­pe­ri­ence that day.</p>
