    <p>Chal­lenger Joe Bi­den put up a bet­ter-than-ex­pected show in Cleve­land on Tues­day night in the first of three head-to-head pres­i­den­tial de­bates with</p>
    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, 77, put Mr Trump, 74, on the de­fen­sive and laid to rest doubts as to his own stamina.</p>
    <p>But the brawly, frac­tious 90 min­utes re­flected the state of the dan­ger­ously di­vided coun­try. Early im­pres­sions were that Mr Bi­den came out look­ing bet­ter, al­beit not strong.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den looked weak; Trump looked like a thug,” a univer­sity pro­fes­sor, who asked not to be named, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But he added: “It was not a de­bate. The low road was taken by Trump and Bi­den took the bait. It was a na­tional em­bar­rass­ment. The peo­ple de­serve to hear what their poli­cies and ideas will be.</p>
    <p>That is not what they got.”</p>
    <p>Whether who won the de­bate will have any ef­fect on in­de­pen­dent and un­de­cided vot­ers will be clear only af­ter wider polls.</p>
    <p>Thus far, polls con­sis­tently show that in a hy­per-po­larised en­vi­ron­ment, most Amer­i­cans have al­ready made up their minds on who they like and who they hate.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s sup­port­ers are in­tensely loyal; the Democrats have to mo­ti­vate more of their base to turn out. They likely will, but it is not clear if they will vote in enough num­bers to win Mr Bi­den the White House.</p>
    <p>Un­til Tues­day, Mr Bi­den still led Mr Trump by some seven points in na­tion­wide polls. And ac­cord­ing to one re­cent poll – by NBC/WSJ – 11 per cent of el­i­gi­ble vot­ers are still un­de­cided about who to vote for.</p>
    <p>All the point scor­ing, and the chaotic na­ture of the de­bate, ob­scured some of the sub­stance.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent stuck to his in­sis­tence that the elec­tion is go­ing to be fraud­u­lent, based on mail-in bal­lots. “This is not go­ing to end well,” he said.</p>
    <p>He was also asked di­rectly by the moder­a­tor: “Are you will­ing tonight to con­demn white su­prem­a­cist and mili­tia groups?”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump an­swered only with an am­biva­lent com­ment on the white su­prem­a­cist group “Proud Boys”.</p>
    <p>“Proud Boys stand by, stand back, but some­body has to do some­thing about (the far left anti-fas­cist net­work) An­tifa,” he said.</p>
    <p>This was im­me­di­ately taken as a pos­i­tive sig­nal by white su­prem­a­cist mili­tia, said re­ports mon­i­tor­ing on­line chat­ter.</p>
    <p>Dr Larry Di­a­mond, au­thor and pro­fes­sor, and scholar of democ­racy at Stan­ford Univer­sity, tweeted: “The Pres­i­dent was given a clear op­por­tu­nity to con­demn white su­prem­a­cists and re­fused to do so. In­stead, he en­cour­aged them.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral times, the de­bate turned into a three-way shout­ing match. The moder­a­tor, Fox News Sun­day’s Chris Wal­lace, was re­peat­edly forced to raise his voice to stop the two – mostly Mr Trump – from in­ter­rupt­ing and talk­ing over each other.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den sol­diered through his talk­ing points mostly star­ing di­rectly at the cam­eras rather than look­ing at Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Both men bat­tled over health­care, the econ­omy, cli­mate change, the Supreme Court and the man­age­ment of the Covid-19 pan­demic. And they hurled barbs at each other.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said Mr Bi­den had fin­ished last, or al­most last, in his class in school. The Pres­i­dent also turned the at­ten­tion on Mr Bi­den’s fam­ily. Re­fer­ring to al­le­ga­tions that Mr Bi­den’s son Hunter had ben­e­fited from the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent’s time in of­fice, Mr Trump said: “China ate your lunch Joe, and no won­der, your son goes in and takes out mil­lions of dol­lars.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den replied: “None of that is true... It’s to­tally dis­cred­ited.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, when pressed by the Pres­i­dent and by Mr Wal­lace on the is­sue of law and or­der, said: “Yes, I’m in favour of law and or­der... with jus­tice, where peo­ple get treated fairly.”</p>
    <p>The Nov 3 elec­tion, as much as it is about poli­cies, is also about the idea of Amer­ica. It pits two ide­olo­gies against each other: One is in­clu­sive, lib­eral and pro­gres­sive, and the other, con­ser­va­tive and na­tivist.</p>
    <p>There are also, for the first time in liv­ing mem­ory, doubts as to a peace­ful tran­si­tion of power.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly de­clined to say whether he would sup­port an or­derly trans­fer of power if he does not win, in­sist­ing that mail-in bal­lots are subject to wide­spread fraud.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the de­bate, Dr Ian Brem­mer, pres­i­dent of risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group, tweeted his take­away: “No im­pact on core Bi­den v Trump sup­port­ers. White na­tion­al­ists very happy.”</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the de­bate, Dr Richard Haass, pres­i­dent of the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions, said on Twit­ter: “That was the most dis­cour­ag­ing, most de­press­ing, most trou­bling 90 min­utes I can re­call. If you are not wor­ried about the fu­ture of this coun­try, you were not watch­ing.”</p>
