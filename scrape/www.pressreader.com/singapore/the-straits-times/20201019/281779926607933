    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The Malaysian health au­thor­i­ties re­ported 871 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, a record daily count, rais­ing the coun­try’s to­tal in­fec­tions to 20,498.</p>
    <p>It also recorded seven new deaths, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties to 187.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had im­posed tar­geted lock­downs last week as in­fec­tions surged in Sabah as well as Se­lan­gor, where the cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur is lo­cated.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral, Tan Sri Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, said 702 of the new cases were de­tected in Sabah, fol­lowed by 72 cases i n Se­lan­gor, 45 in Pe­nang, and 10 in Perak.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing cases were recorded in Kuala Lumpur, Kedah and Labuan.</p>
    <p>Dr Noor Hisham told re­porters that the in­fec­tion rate, or R0, had dropped since a third wave of virus in­fec­tions in the coun­try be­gan four weeks ago.</p>
    <p>The R0, or re­pro­duc­tion num­ber, is the rate of in­fec­tiv­ity and es­ti­mates the av­er­age num­ber of peo­ple that one pos­i­tive Covid-19 pa­tient can in­fect.</p>
    <p>“The R0 value on Sept 20 was 2.2 but in four weeks, it went down to be­tween 1.3 and 1.5. It can be es­ti­mated that daily cases will still in­crease but it won’t be dras­tic,” he said.</p>
    <p>But he added: “We ex­pect this third wave of in­fec­tions to be more chal­leng­ing. Al­though we are more pre­pared in terms of med­i­cal equip­ment, man­power and oth­ers, what is im­por­tant is that we need to con­trol (the spread) so that the in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity can be re­duced.”</p>
    <p>And he warned that if the R0 value stayed at 2.2, the num­ber of new in­fec­tions could be more than 1,000 a day.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t do any­thing, cases will keep in­creas­ing, pos­si­bly to 1,000 (per day) to 3,000. If this con­tin­ues to Oct 31, we might even see up to 5,000 cases.”</p>
