    <p>With less than a year to my of­fi­cial re­tire­ment, the is­sue of whether to con­tinue own­ing a car crops up reg­u­larly be­tween the mis­sus and me.</p>
    <p>There is no real hurry, though, since the cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment on my cur­rent car has around six more years to ex­piry.</p>
    <p>If, how­ever, we de­cide to re­place it, it might be with some­thing like the up­graded Hyundai Venue. The rea­sons are many and may well ap­ply to those who are nowhere near re­tire­ment as well.</p>
    <p>For starters, the car now has a suite of driv­ing aids – blind-spot warn­ing, lane-keeping as­sist, for­ward col­li­sion avoid­ance, driver at­ten­tion mon­i­tor and lead­ing ve­hi­cle de­par­ture alert.</p>
    <p>The last fea­ture is es­pe­cially use­ful for those who ha­bit­u­ally check their phones at a stop, of­ten hold­ing up oth­ers when traf­fic starts mov­ing again. In the Venue, a gen­tle chime sounds when the ve­hi­cle in front starts mov­ing off.</p>
    <p>These aids are avail­able in the Venue S, the vari­ant tested here. Of the lot, lane-keeping as­sist and blind-spot warn­ing make their pres­ence felt the most. In the Hyundai, lane-keeping ex­erts the strong­est steering coun­ter­force among cars with the program. And its blind-spot warn­ing is tuned con­ser­va­tively, so it goes off even if the ve­hi­cle in the next lane is more than two car lengths away.</p>
    <p>I find this some­what ir­ri­tat­ing be­cause when I am be­hind the wheel, I like to be in con­trol. But I fore­see the time will come when such aids come into their own. With age, our senses will be­come less keen and a car which can mit­i­gate this will be wel­come.</p>
    <p>Which brings me to the next rea­son for con­sid­er­ing the Venue – its com­pact­ness. The small­est cross­over in the Hyundai range, it is ex­tremely easy to pi­lot – even in the tini­est and twisti­est of mul­ti­storey carparks.</p>
    <p>On the road, its size and good vis­i­bil­ity al­low the driver to be more eas­ily in touch with his sur­round­ings.</p>
    <p>At the wheel, the Venue feels more like a nippy hatch­back than a sport util­ity ve­hi­cle. Its 1.6-litre en­gine, paired with a con­tin­u­ously vari­able trans­mis­sion (CVT), makes it a throt­tle-happy car­rier which rev­els in stop-start traf­fic. Yet, its sturdy chas­sis makes it a comfy cruiser on open high­ways. Its ride qual­ity is well above av­er­age too.</p>
    <p>The only nig­gle is its ten­dency to re­main in a higher-than-nor­mal en­gine rev band when start­ing off, a char­ac­ter­is­tic of CVTs. The other thing is its fuel con­sump­tion, which at 7.9 litres/100km, is higher than ex­pected of a car its size.</p>
    <p>Else­where, cruise con­trol makes longer hauls on ex­press­ways more ef­fort­less. And as a cross­over, it of­fers eas­ier ingress and egress than sedans and hatches, which tend to be lower slung.</p>
    <p>De­spite its size, the Venue is a fairly com­plete car. Its re­spon­sive­ness makes it feel like a big­ger ve­hi­cle, as does its slew of elab­o­rate fea­tures. These in­clude phone pair­ing, USB charg­ing port, rear-view cam­era and multi-trac­tion con­trol (not so much for tak­ing this fron­twheel-drive off-road, but for bet­ter trac­tion on wet days).</p>
    <p>It is also fairly spa­cious. While the sec­ond row may not be com­fort­able for adults on longer jour­neys, its boot space is rather gen­er­ous for the Venue’s foot­print.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the car has a cheer­ful styling. It gets a new “cas­cad­ing” grille now, mak­ing it more dy­namic look­ing. The test car is in Cos­mic Gray with Acid Yel­low roof and wing-mir­ror cov­ers. Var­i­ous parts of the cabin are in Acid Yel­low too (in­clud­ing leather stitch­ings), giv­ing it a premium feel.</p>
    <p>When you are a se­nior, the last thing you want is a ride which re­minds you of your age.</p>
    <p>The Venue is a like­able car and its ap­peal is in no way con­fined to empty nesters.</p>
