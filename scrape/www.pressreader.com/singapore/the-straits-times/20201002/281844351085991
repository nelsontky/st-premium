    <p>More than 600 mil­lion trips will be taken dur­ing the hol­i­day, down 20 per cent from a year ago, Ctrip es­ti­mated, but they will still force the state rail­way to add 1,000 trains a day. Around 108 mil­lion rail­way trips are ex­pected to be made dur­ing this hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • Hun­dreds of mil­lions in China hus­tled to en­joy their first ma­jor na­tional hol­i­day since the coun­try beat its coro­n­avirus out­break, fill­ing train sta­tions and air­ports yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Golden Week hol­i­day marks the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China in 1949 and sees a mas­sive an­nual move­ment of peo­ple try­ing to get home or take hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>But this year has added sig­nif­i­cance, with the crowds fill­ing the con­courses point­ing to a coun­try re­bound­ing from the out­break and parad­ing the free­dom to travel as a con­trast to the lock­downs hit­ting much of the world.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally, we would take a fam­ily hol­i­day abroad, but this year we opted for a stay­ca­tion,” said Ms Niu Honglin from Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>She booked rooms in a bou­tique ho­tel near Shang­hai Dis­ney­land Park but quickly faced a prob­lem of mil­lions of ex­tra tourists hunt­ing for fun at home. “My daugh­ter had to wait in line for nearly three hours to get on a ride,” she said.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic travel has sprung back to life and given the econ­omy a boost af­ter the virus shut­tered busi­nesses and scared away tourists fol­low­ing its emer­gence in Wuhan late last year. “Peo­ple are trav­el­ling with a vengeance,” said Bei­jing­based banker Huo Binx­ing, who is head­ing to Lhasa in Ti­bet.</p>
    <p>“It’s our first chance to un­wind af­ter such a stress­ful pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Wuhan in cen­tral China is back in busi­ness, too, with vis­i­tors throng­ing to Yel­low Crane Tower, a Taoist shrine, noted the coun­try’s big­gest travel agency Ctrip.</p>
    <p>But some have scrapped plans as the virus con­tin­ues to seed anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>Ms Ming Rui, from Bei­jing, axed a visit to coastal city Qing­dao af­ter two Covid-19 cases were re­ported there last week. “It was our first fam­ily trip this year but we can­celled be­cause I got very ner­vous,” said the fash­ion de­signer whose par­ents are in their 70s.</p>
    <p>More than 600 mil­lion trips will be taken dur­ing the hol­i­day, down 20 per cent from a year ago, Ctrip es­ti­mated, but they will still force the state rail­way to add 1,000 trains a day. Around 108 mil­lion rail­way trips are ex­pected to be made dur­ing this hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>At Bei­jing’s Cap­i­tal Air­port, thou­sands of pas­sen­gers queued up with lug­gage and chil­dren in tow.</p>
    <p>The trav­ellers are likely to bring much-needed spend­ing to farflung parts of China. Last year, they spent US$9.5 bil­lion (S$12.9 bil­lion) dur­ing the Golden Week.</p>
    <p>This year, many peo­ple are tak­ing lux­ury hol­i­days within China, travel op­er­a­tor Qua­nar re­ported, amid global travel re­stric­tions. And the ab­sence of their tourist dol­lars will leave coun­tries in the re­gion – from Thai­land to Cam­bo­dia – winc­ing from the eco­nomic pain caused by the pro­longed clo­sure of bor­ders.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Do&#xAD;mes&#xAD;tic tourism is get&#xAD;ting a big boost with peo&#xAD;ple free to travel within China, and the Great Wall drew huge crowds yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day. Even Wuhan, where the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus out&#xAD;break be&#xAD;gan, is see&#xAD;ing a vis&#xAD;i&#xAD;tor in&#xAD;flux.</p>
