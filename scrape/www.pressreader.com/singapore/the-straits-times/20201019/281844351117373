    <p>HERAT (Afghanista­n) • A car bomb tar­get­ing the Afghan po­lice head­quar­ters in the western province of Ghor yes­ter­day killed at least 12 civil­ians and wounded more than 100, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The strike took place in Firozkoh, the cap­i­tal of Ghor, a province that has not seen much vi­o­lence com­pared with some other re­gions of the con­flict-wracked coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of In­te­rior said the car bomb det­o­nated in front of Ghor po­lice head­quar­ters at about 11am.</p>
    <p>“The ter­ror­ists det­o­nated an ex­plo­sives-filled car... As a re­sult, 12 civil­ians were killed and more than 100 peo­ple were wounded,” the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Mr Juma Gul Yakoobi, a Ghor health of­fi­cial, said that the vic­tims in­cluded mem­bers of the se­cu­rity forces.</p>
    <p>No group has yet claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity, but fight­ing be­tween the Tale­ban and gov­ern­ment has surged in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>“The ex­plo­sion was very pow­er­ful,” said Mr Aref Abir, spokesman for the Ghor gover­nor. “There are fa­tal­i­ties and ca­su­al­ties, and peo­ple are tak­ing them to hos­pi­tals.”</p>
    <p>He said the blast also dam­aged nearby build­ings han­dling af­fairs for women and peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Peace talks be­tween the Tale­ban and Afghan gov­ern­ment be­gan in Qatar last month, but vi­o­lence has con­tin­ued un­abated on the ground.</p>
    <p>The talks ap­pear to be stalled as the Tale­ban and the Kabul ad­min­is­tra­tion have strug­gled to es­tab­lish a ba­sic frame­work for ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
