    <p>A full-time na­tional ser­vice­man was sen­tenced to 21 months’ pro­ba­tion af­ter he mo­lested a sev­enyear-old girl and used his mo­bile phone to film him­self touch­ing her.</p>
    <p>The clip was found on the youth’s lap­top when the po­lice in­ves­ti­gated him for a sep­a­rate up­skirt of­fence.</p>
    <p>Both of­fences were com­mit­ted while he was a polytech­nic stu­dent.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old Sin­ga­porean was sen­tenced yes­ter­day af­ter he pleaded guilty to one count each of mo­lesta­tion and in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty.</p>
    <p>As part of his sen­tence, he has to re­main in­doors from 10pm to 6am ev­ery day and per­form 40 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>He is pro­hib­ited from us­ing mo­bile phones, tablets or any de­vices with at­tached cam­eras.</p>
    <p>His mother and step­fa­ther were also bonded for $5,000 to en­sure his good be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the first in­ci­dent hap­pened on Feb 14, 2018.</p>
    <p>The youth was on his way home at around 5.15pm when he spot­ted the seven-year-old girl and her friend at a fit­ness cor­ner in Bukit Pan­jang.</p>
    <p>He ap­proached the vic­tim and asked the child if she would like to use the pull-up bar in the ex­er­cise area.</p>
    <p>The youth lifted her to the bar and while she was hang­ing from it, he took out his mo­bile phone and ac­ti­vated his cam­era.</p>
    <p>He then mo­lested the girl while record­ing a video be­fore help­ing her down.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor V. Je­sude­van said that the youth deleted the video from his phone af­ter trans­fer­ring it to his lap­top.</p>
    <p>At around 11.30am on July 5 last year, he de­cided to tar­get a 31-year-old woman who was stand­ing in front of him on an es­ca­la­tor at Choa Chu Kang LRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “The vic­tim was alerted to the ac­cused per­son’s ac­tions when the hand­phone came into con­tact with her thigh.”</p>
    <p>The woman then held onto the of­fender’s mo­bile phone and led him to the con­trol sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were alerted soon af­ter. For in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty, an of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined.</p>
