    <p>The United Na­tions Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion (FAO) re­cently cre­ated a re­sponse and re­cov­ery pro­gramme to pre­vent a global food emer­gency amid the Covid-19 pan­demic. This is only one among many tell­tale signs of so­ci­ety head­ing to­wards riskier and po­ten­tially more tur­bu­lent times, as far as food se­cu­rity is con­cerned.</p>
    <p>Even China, de­spite its large pop­u­la­tion, is mak­ing a U-turn in its food pol­icy by fo­cus­ing on do­mes­tic self-suf­fi­ciency. Un­like China, Sin­ga­pore lacks land and can­not sim­ply raise do­mes­tic out­put to at­tain food self-suf­fi­ciency. But that does not nec­es­sar­ily mean it is with­out op­tions.</p>
    <p>The key is to “pan­demic-proof” its food sup­ply chains, with em­pha­sis on di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of sources and build­ing re­silience in the sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>The im­por­tance of “pan­demic-proof­ing” food sup­ply chains can be seen in how coro­n­avirus-in­duced de­lays in ship­ments of in­puts such as seeds and fer­tilis­ers can sig­nif­i­cantly dis­rupt sea­sonal crop plant­ing in Sin­ga­pore’s source coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Given that it takes about three months from plant­ing to har­vest­ing, this means a longer wait for coun­tries such as</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore to get their sup­plies of rice and other ce­re­als.</p>
    <p>To avoid gaps or short­falls, food im­porters would have to en­sure a di­ver­sity of sup­pli­ers as part of their busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plans. These re­silience-build­ing mea­sures ap­ply, too, at the na­tional level. All food-im­port­ing coun­tries need to plan for sud­den dis­rup­tions and di­ver­sify sources as part of risk-mit­i­ga­tion strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion, though, presents sev­eral chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>SAFETY VERSUS AGILITY</p>
    <p>To un­der­stand the dif­fi­cul­ties, con­sider the egg sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore im­ports more than 70 per cent of its eggs, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA). While that fig­ure is lower than that for rice (100 per cent) or veg­eta­bles (about 90 per cent), the egg sec­tor faces unique vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dis­ease is a ma­jor con­cern. The egg sec­tor has to con­tend with dif­fer­ent forms of avian in­fluenza (bird flu), which com­pro­mises pub­lic and an­i­mal health, and out­breaks of sal­mo­nella en­teridi­tis, which is a food safety con­cern for coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore where half-boiled eggs are com­monly con­sumed.</p>
    <p>Thus, over­seas farms need to be ac­cred­ited by the SFA be­fore they can ex­port to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But this gives rise to an­other chal­lenge – if an ac­cred­ited farm is hit by bird flu or sup­ply chains in that coun­try are af­fected by Covid-19, Sin­ga­pore will have to scramble to find al­ter­na­tive sources while main­tain­ing ex­ist­ing an­i­mal health and food safety stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Re­plac­ing the loss of an ex­ist­ing ac­cred­ited sup­plier has to be done quickly be­cause it will take too long for an af­fected farm to re­cover from hav­ing to cull all its birds and rear a new batch of egg-lay­ing chick­ens – at least 20 weeks, ac­cord­ing to the FAO.</p>
    <p>The first dilemma in di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion then is be­tween food safety and agility/swift­ness in shift­ing to other sources. One way to deal with this is to add the cri­te­rion of cri­sis pre­pared­ness, that is, hav­ing busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plans, when pri­ori­tis­ing com­pa­nies per­mit­ted to im­port eggs into Sin­ga­pore. SFA has in­tro­duced this since April last year.</p>
    <p>PRIC­ING MAT­TERS</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, most of the eggs im­ported by Sin­ga­pore come from Malaysia. A smaller share is sourced from Ukraine, South Korea, Spain, Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment presses ahead with di­ver­si­fy­ing sources, ap­prov­ing 50 per cent more egg sources since 2016 and re­cently stump­ing up $30 mil­lion in grants to ramp up lo­cal pro­duc­tion of food (fish, leafy veg­eta­bles and eggs in­cluded), pric­ing is a fac­tor that can­not be ig­nored.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal eggs cur­rently make up a quar­ter of the mar­ket, de­spite prices be­ing higher than those of the ones im­ported from Malaysia. In­ter­na­tional Trade Cen­tre data shows the im­port cost of eggs from Malaysia (in­clud­ing freight and in­sur­ance costs) is still lower than that from other for­eign sources. Eggs from Thai­land and South Korea cost 12.5 per cent to 25 per cent more than those from Malaysia, while New Zealand and Aus­tralian eggs cost 200 per cent more.</p>
    <p>While build­ing re­silience in the egg sup­ply is im­por­tant, im­porters and re­tail­ers can­not es­cape the ba­sic eco­nom­ics of egg pric­ing – the higher the price, the lower the de­mand.</p>
    <p>FAVOURING THE FA­MIL­IAR</p>
    <p>But pric­ing is not the only de­ter­mi­nant of ac­cept­abil­ity. Eggs from Ukraine are 30 per cent cheaper than Malaysia’s, even fac­tor­ing in the trans­port cost. The cost of eggs from Poland is the same as that of Malaysia’s. But they have to over­come the hurdle of con­sumer un­fa­mil­iar­ity.</p>
    <p>This is the chal­lenge faced by sup­pli­ers from non-tra­di­tional sources such as Ukraine, Spain and Poland, even if their prices are com­pet­i­tive and they are es­tab­lished pro­duc­ers who meet Euro­pean Union food safety re­quire­ments that are as strin­gent as those in Sin­ga­pore. Per­ceived dif­fer­ences in qual­ity, safety (al­beit un­war­ranted) or even taste may de­ter Sin­ga­pore con­sumers from try­ing out new sources.</p>
    <p>The re­cent pan­demic-in­duced dis­rup­tions have high­lighted the chal­lenges of bring­ing food to the ta­ble in Sin­ga­pore – there may not be many op­tions to keep eggs or other food­stuff read­ily avail­able with­out turn­ing to new sources. Mul­ti­ple sources not only pre­vent short­ages in case of dis­rup­tion, but also help hold down prices.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers can be picky but some good may yet come out of the height­ened con­scious­ness of food sup­ply chain se­cu­rity as a re­sult of Covid-19. In short, whether it be gov­ern­ments, whole­salers, re­tail­ers or con­sumers, a key take­away from the Covid-19 ex­pe­ri­ence should be that where food is con­cerned, it’s best not to put all your eggs in one bas­ket.</p>
