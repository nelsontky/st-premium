    <p>A teacher per­formed in­de­cent acts on two 15-year-old girls in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents, and at least one of them was a stu­dent from the sec­ondary school where he taught.</p>
    <p>He tar­geted his first vic­tim in 2015. Court doc­u­ments did not state if she was then a stu­dent at his school.</p>
    <p>He per­formed a sex­ual act on his sec­ond vic­tim in his car in 2017, near a block of flats. He also asked the girl to per­form a sex­ual act on him but she re­fused.</p>
    <p>The man later drove the girl home and told her not to tell any­one. But the vic­tim told her close friends about what had hap­pened and the po­lice were later alerted.</p>
    <p>The of­fender, now 33, pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to two counts of per­form­ing an in­de­cent act on a mi­nor and one count of sex­u­ally pen­e­trat­ing an un­der­age girl.</p>
    <p>All three charges in­volved the sec­ond vic­tim. Three other charges, in­clud­ing those in­volv­ing the first vic­tim, will be con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing. De­tails about the man and the school can­not be re­vealed due to a gag or­der. De­fence lawyer Ed­mond Pereira told a dis­trict court his client had re­signed from his job as a teacher.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor (DPP) James Chew said that on Feb 25, 2017, the sec­ond vic­tim re­ceived a text mes­sage from the man ask­ing if she wanted to meet him for a ride. She agreed and he told her not to tell any­one about their out­ing.</p>
    <p>The man picked her up in his car later that day be­fore park­ing near Block 374, Tampines Street 34.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “This time, the ac­cused leaned to­wards the vic­tim and started touch­ing her thigh and neck, while at the same time, ask­ing the vic­tim if she trusted him.</p>
    <p>“At a loss, the vic­tim sim­ply replied that she did. The ac­cused then started to kiss the vic­tim’s neck.”</p>
    <p>The court heard that the man com­mit­ted the of­fences soon af­ter. The girl thwarted his ad­vances and he drove her home.</p>
    <p>She later blocked him on the var­i­ous apps that they had used to com­mu­ni­cate with each other.</p>
    <p>The girl con­fided in her close friends two days later, on Feb 27, 2017.</p>
    <p>She stopped go­ing to school soon af­ter, prompt­ing school staff to visit her home on March 2 that year. A po­lice re­port was made later that day.</p>
    <p>The of­fender, out on $15,000 bail, will be sen­tenced tomorrow.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said the man stopped work­ing for MOE in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>It added: “MOE takes a se­ri­ous view of staff mis­con­duct and will not hes­i­tate to take dis­ci­plinary ac­tion against those who fail to ad­here to our stan­dards of con­duct and dis­ci­pline, in­clud­ing dis­missal from ser­vice.”</p>
