    <p>Recog­nis­ing how the Covid-19 pan­demic has af­fected the lo­cal sport­ing fra­ter­nity, Mr Ed­win Tong, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY), has re­vealed his team is work­ing on more re­lief mea­sures for the sports sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the Chiam See Tong Sports Fund “Live For Sports” vir­tual fundrais­ing din­ner, which col­lected more than the tar­geted $125,000 for un­der-re­sourced ath­letes yes­ter­day, Mr Tong, who was the guest of hon­our, said: “Over the next few weeks, we will work on fur­ther mea­sures and a pack­age to help pre­serve the core sport­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties and pro­tect liveli­hoods.”</p>
    <p>While more de­tails will be an­nounced later this month, this new pack­age will be on top of Sport Sin­ga­pore’s pack­age of mea­sures worth about $23 mil­lion an­nounced in June, which in­cluded the En­ter­prise In­no­va­tion & Ca­pa­bil­ity Grant, Ac­tive En­abler Pro­gramme, cre­ation of tem­po­rary jobs, Ac­tiveSG Cir­cle, and other dig­i­tal con­tent ini­tia­tives and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Since tak­ing over the MCCY port­fo­lio in July, Mr Tong, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law, has gath­ered feed­back from coaches and oth­ers who rely on sports for a liv­ing. He also as­sured na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSAs) of the min­istry’s con­tin­ued sup­port.</p>
    <p>He added: “The most im­por­tant thing we can do is to chart a path to­wards a safe re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties. This is the best way to sup­port liveli­hoods, and al­low our ath­letes to do what they do best – train and com­pete. To­gether with SportSG, we have also had dis­cus­sions on how to bring back many of our favourite sport­ing ex­pe­ri­ences, but in a safe way. We have made some moves, and will con­tinue to do so.”</p>
    <p>He took en­cour­age­ment from be­ing able to work from a strong base in terms of youth de­vel­op­ment and high per­for­mance. In terms of youth de­vel­op­ment, the Na­tional Youth Sports In­sti­tute iden­ti­fies pri­mary school stu­dents for the Ju­nior Sports Academy pro­grammes, while there is also the Sin­ga­pore Sports School as well as academies run by Ac­tiveSG, NSAs and pri­vate clubs that widen the tal­ent pool.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Gov­ern­ment in­vests about $70 mil­lion an­nu­ally in the High Per­for­mance Sports sys­tem, which in­cludes the spexS­chol­ar­ship, to sup­port the de­vel­op­ment of na­tional ath­letes and NSAs.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong added: “For Sin­ga­pore to achieve our sport­ing goals, we need a longer term vi­sion. We will also re­quire bold tar­gets, re­lent­less train­ing, some pa­tience, and the... re­silience to weather set­backs.</p>
    <p>“We know that fund­ing alone can­not be enough... The bonds and syn­ergy be­tween schools, clubs, NSAs, ath­letes, stake­hold­ers and SportSG have to be sin­gu­lar, aligned and strong. My min­istry will sup­port them.”</p>
