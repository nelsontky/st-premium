    <p>Good Samar­i­tans, in­no­va­tive en­trepreneur­s, in­spir­ing fig­ures within the com­mu­nity and ded­i­cated front lin­ers are all in the run­ning for this year’s The Straits Times’ Sin­ga­porean of the Year award, pre­sented by in­vest­ment bank UBS Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic vot­ing for the award, now in its sixth year, be­gins to­day at str.sg/SOTY2020vo­te and will close in two weeks, on Jan 7, at 7pm.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic can cast their vote for any of the nom­i­nees, who have been re­vealed over the past few months.</p>
    <p>The award recog­nises Sin­ga­pore­ans whose ex­tra­or­di­nary ac­tions im­proved some­one’s life or the larger com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>It also recog­nises Sin­ga­pore­ans who have put the coun­try on the world map or per­se­vered to over­come great ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>A panel of judges com­pris­ing ST ed­i­tors, UBS rep­re­sen­ta­tives and in­di­vid­u­als who have made their mark in var­i­ous fields will make a fi­nal de­ci­sion on the re­cip­i­ent next month, while tak­ing into ac­count the re­sults of the pub­lic vote.</p>
    <p>Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, ed­i­torin-chief of the English/Malay/ Tamil Me­dia Group of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings and edi­tor of The Straits Times, said: “In this ex­tra­or­di­nary year, our fo­cus has been very much on the ef­forts of those who have pitched in to help in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“But away from that spot­light, others have also been qui­etly do­ing Sin­ga­pore proud – as en­trepreneur­s, serv­ing in the com­mu­nity or ris­ing to the oc­ca­sion to help a neigh­bour in need.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We salute them all as we be­gin the process of se­lect­ing this year’s Sin­ga­porean of the Year. The pub­lic will have their say, then the panel of judges will heed their voices, as they de­lib­er­ate and de­cide.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, who is the pa­tron of the award, will be the guest of hon­our at the pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­mony in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean of the Year will re­ceive a tro­phy and $20,000, pre­sented by UBS, which has been sup­port­ing the award since its in­au­gu­ra­tion. Other in­di­vid­u­als or groups cho­sen as fi­nal­ists by the panel of judges will re­ceive $5,000 each.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean of the Year will also re­ceive a five-night stay in any of Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels’ global prop­er­ties, while the other fi­nal­ists will get a three-night stay.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines is also spon­sor­ing a pair of busi­ness-class tick­ets for the Sin­ga­porean of the Year, and a pair of econ­omy-class tick­ets for the other fi­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>Last year, the award went to As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Angie Chew, who started Brahm Cen­tre in 2012 to pro­vide free health ed­u­ca­tion and other ser­vices like be­friend­ing, coun­selling and de­men­tia-screen­ing for frail and lonely se­niors.</p>
