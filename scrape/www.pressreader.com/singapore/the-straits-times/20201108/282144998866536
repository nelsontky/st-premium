    <p>Re­cruit­ment and ex­ec­u­tive search com­pany Ta­lentvis runs a 1,800-mem­ber-strong Tele­gram group, link­ing cabin crew past and present to job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>It all started when Ta­lentvis man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ben Chew (right) was look­ing to hire an ex­ec­u­tive as­sis­tant last year. He even­tu­ally hired Ms Michelle Tay (right be­low), a lead­ing stew­ardess with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA).</p>
    <p>Mr Chew, 45, had in­ter­viewed sev­eral cabin crew for the po­si­tion and re­alised that while many were tal­ented, smart and driven, they were un­sure about how to plan for a sec­ond ca­reer and had un­re­al­is­tic salary ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>So in Septem­ber last year, he started a Tele­gram group to share ca­reer ad­vice with cabin crew who were look­ing for al­ter­na­tive ca­reers. From an ini­tial 200 sub­scribers, this fig­ure bal­looned nine­fold after the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Group an­nounced lay­offs in Septem­ber this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew says: “Many cabin crew felt lost. Those who were not let go were un­sure if there would be an­other round of lay­offs and wanted to know what op­tions they had out­side of fly­ing. Some wanted to start search­ing for an­other role im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is now run as a spe­cial project by Ta­lentvis, ti­tled Jobs For Cabin Crew. Ms Tay, 35, the project owner who is also the com­pany’s cor­po­rate ser­vices and re­la­tions man­ager, flags job op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as those in re­tail, cus­tomer re­la­tions and sales, to group mem­bers, and posts avail­able job ad­ver­tise­ments on so­cial me­dia. In­ter­ested can­di­dates then call or mes­sage Ta­lentvis, or ar­range for con­sul­ta­tions and ca­reer plan­ning.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s re­cruiters then match the cabin crew to avail­able roles among its clients, which in­clude firms in the lo­gis­tics, re­tail, in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, bank­ing and fi­nance sec­tors.</p>
    <p>This year alone, Ta­lentvis has helped about 15 cabin crew find full-time jobs in non-avi­a­tion in­dus­tries. Its Sin­ga­pore of­fice has hired six cabin crew in po­si­tions such as re­cruit­ment con­sul­tants and prod­uct man­agers. The com­pany has of­fices in Malaysia, In­done­sia, Thai­land and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew says: “We are happy to be a chan­nel for dis­tressed cabin crew to iden­tify new ca­reer op­tions.”</p>
