    <p>As China and In­dia face off along dif­fer­ent points in the Ladakh re­gion, a volatile bor­der is the new re­al­ity be­tween the two coun­tries, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>For In­dia, this comes in ad­di­tion to its al­ready volatile bor­der with Pak­istan, where cross­fire is a reg­u­lar oc­cur­rence.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the In­dia-China bor­der had re­mained sta­ble for over four decades. But on Mon­day, both sides ac­cused each other of fir­ing warn­ing shots in what would be the first shots fired near the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC), the de facto bor­der. China said In­dia had moved troops across the bor­der, which In­dia de­nied. Delhi in turn ac­cused Beijing of “ag­gres­sive ma­noeu­vres”.</p>
    <p>The past five months have seen mul­ti­ple episodes be­tween Chi­nese and In­dian troops in the Ladakh re­gion, lead­ing to con­cerns that the sit­u­a­tion could spi­ral out of con­trol in spite of mil­i­tary and diplo­matic talks.</p>
    <p>There is much spec­u­la­tion in In­dia over why China has opened a front with its South Asian neigh­bour in the mid­dle of a pan­demic and at a time when Beijing is also em­broiled in ten­sions in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>One trig­ger is seen to be In­dia’s in­fra­struc­ture push in the bor­der ar­eas to fur­ther fa­cil­i­tate troop de­ploy­ments, in­clud­ing build­ing feeder roads and bridges, par­tic­u­larly in east­ern Ladakh.</p>
    <p>An­other is the move by the In­dian gov­ern­ment a year ago to re­draw In­dia’s map by carv­ing Ladakh out of the state of Jammu and Kash­mir and con­vert­ing it into a union ter­ri­tory that falls di­rectly un­der fed­eral rule.</p>
    <p>Twenty In­dian sol­diers were killed in Gal­wan Val­ley in June in a vi­o­lent clash with their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts as troops massed at sev­eral points of the LAC.</p>
    <p>Late last month, In­dian troops suc­cess­fully stopped the Chi­nese from mov­ing for­ward and oc­cu­py­ing higher van­tage points on the south­ern bank of the Pan­gong Tso, a cross-coun­try Hi­malayan lake that has emerged as a new flash point, even as talks were on­go­ing to resolve dif­fer­ences on the north­ern bank.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said in­sta­bil­ity along the LAC would per­sist amid the re­newed jos­tle for supremacy in the tough Hi­malayan ter­rain, with both sides po­ten­tially hun­ker­ing down for the win­ter months.</p>
    <p>“What is now go­ing to hap­pen is that we are go­ing to see a very un­sta­ble LAC and that is some­thing the In­di­ans and Chi­nese will have to live with,” said Pro­fes­sor Harsh V. Pant from the Observer Re­search Foun­da­tion think-tank in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>“China, with the kind of build-up along LAC and the kind of ter­ri­to­rial en­croach­ment that has hap­pened (in the past five months), would be very loath to give it back. In the past, In­dia would try not to ratchet up ten­sions on the bor­der. Now they are real­is­ing that they have lit­tle op­tion but to be proac­tive and take the Chi­nese bull by the horns.”</p>
    <p>In­dia and China went to war in 1962 and have con­tin­ued to have an un­easy re­la­tion­ship due to Beijing’s grow­ing pres­ence in In­dia’s neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>China claims the north-east­ern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which has been in In­dian hands since Bri­tish days.</p>
    <p>And In­dia says China’s oc­cu­pa­tion of Ak­sai Chin, a 38,000-sq km area in the In­dian union ter­ri­tory of Ladakh, is il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said that in spite of both coun­tries high­light­ing the im­por­tance of di­a­logue, there re­mains the chance of ten­sions erupt­ing on the ground.</p>
    <p>“It is a volatile sit­u­a­tion. You have 10,000 troops sit­ting a few me­tres from each other. There may be pent-up feel­ings (against each other) in the lo­cal ar­eas,” said Chi­nese stud­ies pro­fes­sor Srikanth Kon­da­palli at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Still, both sides have con­tin­ued to high­light the im­por­tance of di­a­logue at the mil­i­tary and diplo­matic lev­els.</p>
    <p>De­fence min­is­ter-level talks last week yielded lit­tle re­sult, but Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter S. Jaishankar headed to Rus­sia yes­ter­day for a meet­ing of the Coun­cil of For­eign Min­is­ters of the Shang­hai Co­op­er­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion, where he will meet his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wang Yi.</p>
    <p>Prof Pant said that as of now there is no in­cen­tive for ei­ther side to with­draw from their re­spec­tive po­si­tions in the Ladakh re­gion and he does not see a res­o­lu­tion any­time soon.</p>
    <p>“There is no in­cen­tive for China to go back to sta­tus quo and for In­dian side there is no in­cen­tive to trust the Chi­nese. This is why volatil­ity is there on the LAC,” he said. “Trust has com­pletely bro­ken down and is in free fall.”</p>
