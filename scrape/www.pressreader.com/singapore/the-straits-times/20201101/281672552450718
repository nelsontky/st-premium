    <p>Sin­ga­pore strongly con­demns the ter­ror­ist at­tack at the Notre Dame Cathe­dral in Nice in the south of France on Oct 29, said the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It had re­sulted in the death and in­jury of in­no­cent peo­ple in a place of wor­ship. We ex­tend our deep­est con­do­lences to the be­reaved fam­i­lies, and wish the in­jured a swift re­cov­ery,” said MFA of the knife at­tack that be­headed a woman and killed two oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The sus­pected at­tacker, a 21-year-old Tu­nisian immigrant who had re­cently ar­rived in France, was shot be­fore be­ing taken away by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“There can be no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for such at­tacks against in­no­cent civil­ians. Sin­ga­pore has a zero-tol­er­ance pol­icy against all forms of vi­o­lence and ex­trem­ism,” MFA said.</p>
    <p>The French gov­ern­ment has raised the na­tional se­cu­rity alert to its high­est level, fol­low­ing the knife at­tack that oc­curred about two weeks af­ter a school teacher in a Paris sub­urb was be­headed by an 18-year-old at­tacker who was re­port­edly incensed by the teacher show­ing a car­toon of the Prophet Muham­mad in class.</p>
    <p>“Se­cu­rity mea­sures and sur­veil­lance can be ex­pected to be re­in­forced. Sin­ga­pore­ans in France are ad­vised to re­main vig­i­lant and fol­low the ad­vice of lo­cal au­thor­i­ties,” MFA said.</p>
