    <p>Robin­sons be­gan its storewide sales yes­ter­day at its last two out­lets in Sin­ga­pore at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>A Robin­sons spokesman said the sales would con­tinue un­til all stock was sold, and that new stock was still ar­riv­ing as ware­houses are be­ing emp­tied.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer’s ap­pointed liq­uida­tor, Kor­daMen­tha, which is look­ing into the clos­ing of the two stores, hopes they will re­main open for the com­ing weeks to fa­cil­i­tate fi­nal sales for cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>In an on­line doc­u­ment an­swer­ing cus­tomers’ fre­quently asked ques­tions, Kor­daMen­tha said that it was hope­ful of ex­e­cut­ing a sale cam­paign un­til around the mid­dle to end of next month.</p>
    <p>The 162-year-old de­part­ment store an­nounced on Oct 30 the im­pend­ing clo­sure of its last two stores here, adding that the de­ci­sion to liq­ui­date was prompted by a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment of Robin­sons’ clos­ing-down sales, cus­tomers were seen queue­ing to en­ter the Heeren store, with a fast-mov­ing queue of about 30 peo­ple in the early evening.</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer Lionel Lim, 25, was there to buy shirts. “I need shirts for up­com­ing oc­ca­sions like Chi­nese New Year and Christ­mas... and I don’t know when Robin­sons would close,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some cus­tomers have raised con­cerns over mat­tresses they paid the re­tailer for but have yet to re­ceive.</p>
    <p>Kor­daMen­tha said on Thurs­day that cus­tomers who or­dered Sim­mons, Sealy, Serta or King Koil mat­tresses from Robin­sons and have paid in full can ex­pect them to be de­liv­ered, as the sup­pli­ers will hon­our the pur­chases.</p>
    <p>A fifth com­pany, Mat­tress In­ter­na­tional (MaxCoil), said yes­ter­day that it would also hon­our or­ders.</p>
    <p>“We have... con­tacted all af­fected cus­tomers and have con­firmed their de­liv­er­ies with­out any ad­di­tional charges, re­gard­less of their pay­ment sta­tus to Robin­sons,” it said.</p>
    <p>For cus­tomers who have made a de­posit of $200 with Robin­sons, MaxCoil said it would ab­sorb the cost of the de­posit and ful­fil the or­der if the re­main­ing amount is paid to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Kor­daMen­tha said on Thurs­day that dis­cus­sions with other mat­tress sup­pli­ers are on­go­ing, and it will pro­vide up­dates when they are avail­able.</p>
