    <p>STOCK­HOLM • Swe­den, which has long shunned lock­downs and face­mask or­ders as tools in fight­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, has given its gov­ern­ment power to act more force­fully to stem the spread of the disease.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment last Fri­day passed an emer­gency law that will al­low the gov­ern­ment to limit the num­ber of peo­ple in shops, busi­nesses and public places, like the­atres and public swim­ming pools, or even or­der their clo­sure in case of vi­o­la­tions. The gov­ern­ment will also be able to fine in­di­vid­u­als for break­ing coro­n­avirus rules.</p>
    <p>The new pow­ers went into ef­fect yes­ter­day, free­ing the gov­ern­ment to do more than make rec­om­men­da­tions, as it has thus far. But with the coun­try strug­gling to bat­tle a sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus, and with emer­gency wards fill­ing up to crit­i­cal ca­pac­ity, the gov­ern­ment said it needed more tools.</p>
    <p>As at Jan 9, Swe­den’s to­tal death toll stood at 9,433. It now has 93 deaths per 100,000 peo­ple, fewer than Bri­tain, which has 120, but far more than its neighbour Nor­way with nine.</p>
    <p>“We see a great risk that we will be in a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion for some time ahead,” Prime Min­is­ter Stefan Lofven told the SVT net­work. “Of course, that means the pan­demic law will be used. And we will be us­ing it in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate de­ci­sion im­ple­mented last Thurs­day, face masks are now rec­om­mended for use dur­ing rush hour on public trans­port. They are not manda­tory.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts are call­ing for even stricter mea­sures. “This l aw is great but not enough,” said pro­fes­sor of clin­i­cal vi­rol­ogy Fredrik Elgh at Umea Univer­sity. “We need a four-week lock­down badly to stop this in­crease.”</p>
