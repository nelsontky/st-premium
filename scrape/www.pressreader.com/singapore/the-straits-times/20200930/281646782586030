    <p>The amount of pri­vate hos­pi­tal bills that MediShield Life will cover will be cut from 35 per cent to 25 per cent from the first quar­ter of next year, if the pro­posal by the MediShield Life Council is im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>This change may af­fect the pri­vate in­te­grated plans of­fered by seven in­sur­ers, which in­cor­po­rate MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed change is be­cause, at 35 per cent pro-ra­tion, a pri­vate hos­pi­tal bill far out­strips the cost of the same pro­ce­dure in a sub­sidised ward, which is what MediShield Life pri­mar­ily caters for.</p>
    <p>This means poorer pa­tients get­ting sub­sidised care are es­sen­tially un­der­writ­ing the more ex­pen­sive pri­vate care of wealth­ier pa­tients in pri­vate hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Com­pare, for in­stance, the av­er­age bill size for a heart an­giogram to check for blocked ar­ter­ies. This costs $2,470 in a B2 sub­sidised ward and $10,314 in a pri­vate hos­pi­tal, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>A 35 per cent MediShield Life claim for the pri­vate hos­pi­tal bill comes to $3,610 – which is $1,140 more than the B2 bill.</p>
    <p>At 25 per cent, MediShield cov­ers only $2,579 of the pri­vate hos­pi­tal bill, which makes it just slightly higher than the B2 bill.</p>
    <p>The council has there­fore de­cided to re­duce the claimable amount to 25 per cent of pri­vate hos­pi­tal bills, as this is more aligned with sub­sidised bills.</p>
    <p>This change will af­fect the seven in­sur­ers pro­vid­ing In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs) for pri­vate care that 70 per cent of res­i­dents here have.</p>
    <p>As IPs in­cor­po­rate MediShield Life, which is com­pul­sory for all Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, their pre­mi­ums are payable with Medis­ave, sub­ject to a cap.</p>
    <p>It will mean that the in­sur­ers will have to foot a larger share of pri­vate hos­pi­tal claims, as they will re­ceive a lower pay­out amount from MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>How­ever, pol­i­cy­hold­ers who opt for pri­vate A or B1 class treat­ment in public hos­pi­tals will con­tinue to get 35 per cent of their bills paid by</p>
    <p>MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>The Life In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion (LIA) Sin­ga­pore said it and the IP in­sur­ers will study the pro­posed changes closely and will give feed­back to the MediShield Life Council dur­ing its public con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Its early re­ac­tion is that “some of th­ese pro­posed changes, should they be im­ple­mented, may lead to the fur­ther es­ca­la­tion of claims costs for IPs and, con­se­quently, IP pre­mi­ums”.</p>
    <p>But its spokesman said all the changes need to be care­fully as­sessed in to­tal­ity, to de­ter­mine if there will be any im­pact on claims costs and IP pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>LIA told The Straits Times: “IPs con­tinue to ex­pe­ri­ence sig­nif­i­cant claims cost in­creases, which are putting up­ward pres­sures on IP pre­mi­ums. Most IP in­sur­ers con­tinue to make a net loss since the launch of MediShield Life in Novem­ber 2015.”</p>
    <p>It added that its pri­or­ity is to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans “con­tinue to have ac­cess to af­ford­able qual­ity healthcare with the ad­di­tional cover­age pro­vided by IPs” and at the same time, for the in­sur­ers, that it re­mains fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able so they are able to con­tinue of­fer­ing th­ese poli­cies.</p>
    <p>At 35 per cent pro-ra­tion, a pri­vate hos­pi­tal bill far out­strips the cost of the same pro­ce­dure in a sub­sidised ward, which is what MediShield Life pri­mar­ily caters for.</p>
