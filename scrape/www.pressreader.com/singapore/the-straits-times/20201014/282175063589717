    <p>There have been con­stant calls from Malaysia for the re­open­ing of the Malaysia-Sin­ga­pore bor­der, par­tic­u­larly the links in Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>It is true that peo­ple and busi­nesses have been affected by the bor­der clo­sure since March 18.</p>
    <p>While both coun­tries are look­ing for­ward to jump-start­ing their economies, we should be more cir­cum­spect and ra­tio­nal in deal­ing with the is­sue in the light of the sit­u­a­tion in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>As our clos­est neighbour is fac­ing a third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, prompt re­open­ing of the bor­der may re­sult in dire con­se­quences, par­tic­u­larly at this junc­ture where the sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore is well un­der con­trol and fast im­prov­ing.</p>
    <p>We cer­tainly do not want a resur­gence of Covid-19, as has hap­pened in other coun­tries where com­pla­cency and con­fu­sion set in.</p>
    <p>We must not think of only the peo­ple who may lose their jobs if the bor­ders re­main closed for a longer time. What mat­ters most is the health is­sue, which should be our pri­or­ity over the eco­nomic is­sue.</p>
    <p>Los­ing a job is a tem­po­rary set­back; how­ever, a life once lost is lost for­ever.</p>
    <p>It is im­per­a­tive that both coun­tries take the time to dis­cuss preven­tion and pub­lic health mat­ters, and come up with mea­sures which must be mu­tu­ally agreed upon by both par­ties.</p>
