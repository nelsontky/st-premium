    <p>When her daugh­ter Atira was six months old, Mrs Suman Menezes re­alised that some­thing was amiss.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band, Mr Anand Menezes, who are In­dian na­tion­als, no­ticed that Atira was un­able to sit up­right. Up un­til then, the girl had shown no signs of de­vel­op­men­tal de­lay and had hit all the mile­stones of a grow­ing in­fant, such as rolling over on her back.</p>
    <p>Things be­gan to go down­hill af­ter. A month af­ter her third birth­day, Atira suf­fered her first of many seizures to come. At five, she fi­nally learnt to walk, but with an un­steady gait that has per­sisted un­til to­day. Now 17, she is still un­able to speak.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s younger daugh­ter, Seana, who was born in 2011, eight years af­ter her sis­ter, suf­fered from sim­i­lar symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors whom the cou­ple spoke to were not able to pin­point the sis­ters’ con­di­tion be­cause the symp­toms they ex­hib­ited were not spe­cific or unique to a cer­tain ill­ness, such as epilepsy.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple fi­nally got their an­swer in 2018. This was about 15 years af­ter their first child was born, and three years af­ter both Atira and Seana were en­tered in a KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH) pro­gramme called</p>
    <p>Bridges, or Bring­ing Re­search In­no­va­tions for the Di­ag­no­sis of Ge­netic dis­eases in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Their doc­tor, Dr Saumya Ja­muar, a se­nior con­sul­tant of ge­net­ics ser­vice at KKH, had en­tered them in the pro­gramme, which is done in col­lab­o­ra­tion with ge­nomic re­search in­sti­tutes such as the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star).</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme puts chil­dren sus­pected of hav­ing ge­netic dis­eases through a se­ries of ge­netic tests to iden­tify the con­di­tion they have.</p>
    <p>Through a ge­netic test known as ex­ome se­quenc­ing, Atira and Seana were found to be the first known cases in the world suf­fer­ing from Ja­muar syn­drome, a rare form of ge­netic ab­nor­mal­ity that re­sults in de­vel­op­men­tal de­lays, epilep­tic fits, speech im­pair­ment and an un­steady gait.</p>
    <p>The sib­lings’ con­di­tions were found to be caused by a vari­a­tion in the UGDH gene, which was pre­vi­ously not as­so­ci­ated with any ge­netic dis­eases in hu­mans.</p>
    <p>The ge­netic mu­ta­tion was found to be linked with re­duced brain de­vel­op­ment and re­ces­sive epilep­tic en­cephalopa­thy – a con­di­tion char­ac­terised by epilep­tic seizures and speech and de­vel­op­men­tal de­lays.</p>
    <p>The re­search di­rec­tor of A*Star’s In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Bi­ol­ogy, Dr Bruno Rev­er­sade, whose team es­tab­lished this find­ing in the lab­o­ra­tory, said the dis­cov­ery could pave the way to find­ing new ther­a­peu­tic tar­gets for epilep­sies.</p>
    <p>Since the Menezes sib­lings were di­ag­nosed with the con­di­tion, 36 more chil­dren world­wide – in­clud­ing af­fected sib­lings – have been iden­ti­fied with Ja­muar syn­drome, named af­ter the sis­ters’ doc­tor this Jan­uary, when the find­ing was pub­lished in Na­ture Com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Ja­muar said that al­though the dis­cov­ery has not changed the ex­ist­ing treat­ment and ther­a­pies for the Menezes sis­ters, it could have an im­pact on fu­ture treat­ment for chil­dren sim­i­lar to Atira and Seana.</p>
    <p>“We now know where to look in terms of de­sign­ing strate­gies for treat­ment. We’re not there yet, but that might be the next fron­tier.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Menezes, 47, who came to Sin­ga­pore in 2010 and works in the field of in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, know­ing the di­ag­no­sis was a form of clo­sure.</p>
    <p>It was the same for Mrs Menezes, 42, who quit her job in 2006 as a med­i­cal and psy­chi­atric coun­sel­lor to care for her two chil­dren. “It gave us psy­cho­log­i­cal com­fort, to know that there is a med­i­cal rea­son as to why our chil­dren had these symp­toms,” she said.</p>
    <p>“As par­ents, we would have been very happy if there was a treat­ment or med­i­ca­tion for our kids. But as this is a ge­netic dis­or­der, I know we might not be able to see a treat­ment. But in the long run, if that is avail­able, it would be a blessing.”</p>
