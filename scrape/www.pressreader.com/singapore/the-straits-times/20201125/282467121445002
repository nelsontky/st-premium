    <p>• Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers man­ager Nuno Espir­ito Santo saluted his side’s fight­ing spirit af­ter they fought back to claim a point against Southamp­ton in a 1-1 draw on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Wolves’ Pe­dro Neto came off the bench to can­cel out Theo Wal­cott’s strike for Southamp­ton as the two sides bat­tled to an en­ter­tain­ing stale­mate in their Premier League clash at the Mo­lineux Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>With de­fender Conor Coady’s run of 119 con­sec­u­tive l eague games for Wolves brought to an end when he was ruled out due to a close con­tact test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the hosts looked shaky in de­fence as they shifted to a flat back four for the first time dur­ing Nuno’s reign.</p>
    <p>“We try to be solid and we man­aged that. Let’s see if we play a back four again, (but) that’s not the point. We should an­a­lyse what we have and try to im­prove it,” Nuno told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>“But the spirit was good. Par­tic­u­larly af­ter the last game (a 1-0 loss to Le­ices­ter) it is al­ways im­por­tant to bounce back.”</p>
    <p>With Danny Ings out in­jured,</p>
    <p>Wal­cott (be­low) played as a striker along­side Che Adams. And it paid off when he rat­tled home Adams’ cen­tre in the 58th minute to score his first goal for the club since re­join­ing them on loan from Ever­ton last month.</p>
    <p>“It was a very tidy fin­ish in the end, Che gave me the as­sist, I was pleased with my goal. It feels like a win, they play some fan­tas­tic foot­ball and it’s a re­ally good point,” Wal­cott, who made his first Saints bow in 2005, told Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Arsenal man squan­dered a great chance to make it 2-0 six min­utes later and it was to prove costly as Wolves fought back, Raul Jimenez strik­ing a post in the 75th af­ter good work by Joao Moutinho be­fore Neto re­acted quick­est to slam the ball home.</p>
    <p>The home side had the bet­ter chances but there were no more goals and the re­sult leaves Southamp­ton fifth on 17 points, three be­hind pace­set­ters Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur and Liver­pool, while Wolves are ninth on 14 points af­ter nine games.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy to work with Theo, he def­i­nitely showed it means some­thing to him to play for this club,” Southamp­ton man­ager Ralph Hasen­huttl said.</p>
    <p>“You can feel how much he in­vests work­ing for the team.</p>
    <p>“We did our max­i­mum with the squad we have. I’m very proud of my team be­cause tak­ing some­thing was not easy. It was like chess, both man­agers found so­lu­tions to cause the other one prob­lems.”</p>
