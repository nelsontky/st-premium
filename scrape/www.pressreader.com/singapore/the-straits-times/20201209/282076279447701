    <p>To meet the de­mand for ap­plied learn­ing, the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) will of­fer six new work-study diploma cour­ses next year, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of such of­fer­ings to 30.</p>
    <p>The new cour­ses are in the ar­eas of air­craft cabin en­gi­neer­ing, air­craft main­te­nance en­gi­neer­ing, cloud man­age­ment and op­er­a­tions, event man­age­ment, fit­ness man­age­ment and op­ti­cianry.</p>
    <p>The work-study tech­ni­cal diploma pro­gramme, launched in 2018, typ­i­cally lasts be­tween 2½ and three years. It is meant to pro­vide a skills-based av­enue for ITE grad­u­ates to up­grade them­selves and build their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>Part­ner com­pa­nies hire stu­dents as full-time salaried staff, and 70 per cent of cur­ricu­lum time com­prises on-the-job train­ing. Stu­dents are awarded diploma cer­tifi­cates after the stint.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 230 com­pa­nies com­mit­ted to a part­ner­ship with ITE un­der this pro­gramme. They will of­fer 850 place­ments for the new in­take in April next year.</p>
    <p>This is up from 100 trainees across 41 com­pa­nies in 2018, when the pro­gramme be­gan.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives signed let­ters of of­fer at a vir­tual event, wit­nessed by Sec­ond Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ma­liki Os­man, ITE chair­man An­drew Chong and chief ex­ec­u­tive Low Khah Gek, and Dr Gog Soon Joo, the chief fu­tur­ist and chief skills of­fi­cer at Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Dr Ma­liki also shared de­tails of a re­view he is head­ing on what more the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) can do to en­sure ITE and polytech­nic grad­u­ates are pre­pared for the work­ing world. The re­view was an­nounced by Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­liki said: “MOE recog­nises the value of ap­plied ed­u­ca­tion path­ways for our stu­dents to gain skills rel­e­vant to in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Even so with al­most 70 per cent of our Pri­mary 1 co­hort choos­ing the ITE/polytech­nic route.”</p>
    <p>He out­lined three key ar­eas of the re­view, which aims to bet­ter sup­port the di­verse strengths and as­pi­ra­tions of these stu­dents, and the needs of em­ploy­ers and in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>First, MOE will look at how to fur­ther en­hance the cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>A key fo­cus in par­tic­u­lar will be on strength­en­ing the ITE and the polytech­nic cur­ric­u­lar of­fer­ings and path­ways for stu­dents to build higher skills and pro­vide more up­grad­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“We will ex­plore strength­en­ing the ITE cur­ricu­lum so stu­dents can con­tinue to lever­age skills learnt to re­main rel­e­vant in the fu­ture econ­omy,” Dr Ma­liki said.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond area will be to in­crease op­por­tu­ni­ties and ser­vices for stu­dents and fresh grad­u­ates as they build their ca­reers and up­grade their skills. The work-study diploma and work-study post­diploma pro­grammes are key path­ways for this, he said, and MOE will ex­am­ine how such path­ways can be en­hanced and ex­panded.</p>
    <p>Third, MOE will study how to ex­pand com­mu­nity part­ner­ships and pro­gram­ming to bet­ter sup­port stu­dents with higher needs.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing months, MOE will en­gage stu­dents and alumni, and draw in­sights from in­dus­try mem­bers and ed­u­ca­tors, Dr Ma­liki said.</p>
    <p>“We must con­tinue to en­sure our stu­dents are well equipped with the nec­es­sary skills to em­bark on ful­fill­ing ca­reers, amid rapidly trans­form­ing job roles and man­power de­mands.”</p>
    <p>Ms Low, ITE’s CEO, told The Straits Times that de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, the num­ber of com­pa­nies par­tic­i­pat­ing in the pro­gramme has “stayed rel­a­tively strong”.</p>
    <p>“Our in­dus­try part­ners are still very sup­port­ive and we have been con­tin­u­ally get­ting in­quiries on our work-study diploma pro­grammes,” she said.</p>
