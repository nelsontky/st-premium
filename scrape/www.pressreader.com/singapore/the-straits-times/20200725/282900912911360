    <p>Well-known karaoke chain Teo Heng may soon close half of its 14 out­lets here as a re­sult of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It has al­ready ended oper­a­tions at its Ka­tong Shop­ping Cen­tre and Sem­bawang Shop­ping Cen­tre branches.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack­son Teo, founder of Teo Heng KTV, which op­er­ates the chain, told Shin Min Daily News it has been “very bad” for his busi­ness since en­ter­tain­ment venues, in­clud­ing bars and karaoke out­lets, were or­dered to close in late March to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>While cin­e­mas have since been al­lowed to re­open, this is not the case for karaoke venues.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old said: “Clos­ing out­lets is a very painful de­ci­sion, but it is nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>He was es­pe­cially sad to close the Ka­tong out­let, which opened in 1989 and was the chain’s first.</p>
    <p>“I think this pan­demic is a black­swan event out of our con­trol. If the epi­demic is over in six months, I think we can con­tinue to op­er­ate and make a come­back. And if things don’t im­prove by then, I think we have to ac­cept that this is fate.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which hires more than 130 em­ploy­ees, has not cut its staff’s salaries de­spite hav­ing no in­come for the last four months.</p>
    <p>It was able to stay afloat, Mr Teo said, due to as­sis­tance such as rental re­lief or wage sub­si­dies through the Jobs Sup­port Scheme. But he said such as­sis­tance might end soon.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo es­tab­lished Teo Heng in 1989. It has be­come known for its bud­get- and fam­ily-friendly karaoke ser­vice. It has 14 out­lets across the is­land at lo­ca­tions such as Cause­way Point, Sun­tec City, Be­dok Point, Junc­tion 10 and The Star Vista.</p>
    <p>One of the chain’s reg­u­lars, se­cu­rity oper­a­tions ex­ec­u­tive Va­lerie Yeo, said she was dev­as­tated when she heard the news. The 25-yearold has been vis­it­ing its out­lets every other week since she was 14.</p>
    <p>She said: “It’s so sad that such an iconic Sin­ga­pore busi­ness has to close so many out­lets. I al­ways like to sing at their out­lets be­cause it costs as lit­tle as $18 for three hours on Mon­days to Thurs­days, and I can sing lots of songs by Sin­ga­porean singer JJ Lin with my friends.”</p>
    <p>Other chains are also feel­ing the stress of be­ing un­able to re­sume oper­a­tions. Manekineko, which has eight out­lets in Sin­ga­pore, says it is try­ing to keep all its staff through sub­si­dies and cost-cut­ting ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Koshi­daka Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Akira Zama, who is in charge of the brand here, said: “At the mo­ment, we don’t have any plans to lay off our staff. Gov­ern­ment sup­port will mostly cover us un­til the end of this month. If no ad­di­tional sup­port is an­nounced and we are not al­lowed to re­sume busi­ness soon, we will face a much more se­vere sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have been re­ceiv­ing many inquiries from our pa­trons and would like to re­sume as soon as pos­si­ble to pro­vide our ser­vice to these cus­tomers again.”</p>
