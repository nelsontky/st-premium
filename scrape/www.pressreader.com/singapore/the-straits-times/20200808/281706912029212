    <p>• In­dia, the coun­try hard­est hit in Asia by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, re­ported a record daily jump in in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, tak­ing its to­tal num­ber of cases to over two mil­lion, as the gov­ern­ment strug­gled to con­tain the spread amid strik­ing health work­ers.</p>
    <p>More than 3.5 mil­lion health work­ers, who have been the foot sol­diers in Covid-19 de­tec­tion ef­forts across In­dia, em­barked on a two-day strike from yes­ter­day to se­cure bet­ter wages and proper pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>“At least 100 health work­ers have died of Covid-19 in the coun­try so far, but there has been no in­surance pro­vided to them by the gov­ern­ment,” said Ms A.R. Sindhu, sec­re­tary of the Cen­tre of Trade Unions, a key par­tic­i­pant in the on­go­ing strike.</p>
    <p>With in­fec­tions spread­ing fur­ther to smaller towns and ru­ral ar­eas, ex­perts say the epi­demic in In­dia is likely to be months away from hit­ting its peak, putting more strain on an al­ready over­bur­dened health­care sys­tem in a coun­try of 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the third na­tion to pass the un­wanted mile­stone of two mil­lion Covid-19 cases, be­hind only the United States and Brazil.</p>
    <p>In­dia has been post­ing an av­er­age of around 50,000 new cases a day since mid-June, but ex­perts say its test­ing rate at 16,035 per mil­lion peo­ple is far too low.</p>
    <p>“A coun­try of In­dia’s size and di­ver­sity has mul­ti­ple epi­demics in dif­fer­ent phases,” said Dr Ra­jib Das­gupta, head of the Cen­tre of So­cial Medicine and Com­mu­nity Health at the Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Ja­pan also set a new daily record yes­ter­day, with 1,584 cases. Tokyo reg­is­tered 462 cases, just shy of its peak of 472 last week, while Osaka’s 255 in­fec­tions and Ok­i­nawa’s 100 in­fec­tions were new daily highs.</p>
