    <p>Two Sun­days ago, I was taken aback to see four for­eign work­ers strug­gling to lift a tree trunk to plant out­side the former Tampines Ju­nior Col­lege. Hard as they tried, they could not do it.</p>
    <p>While it’s hard to tell the weight of the trunk, the fact that these work­ers wres­tled to lift it clearly demon­strated the dif­fi­culty of their as­sign­ment.</p>
    <p>From what I could see, it was not just one trunk that they had to lift and plant. There were sev­eral oth­ers.</p>
    <p>These for­eign work­ers earn a mea­gre salary do­ing such a dan­ger­ous task.</p>
    <p>Surely they de­serve some ba­sic tools like ropes and straps to winch the trunks and not have to carry out the task with just their bare hands.</p>
    <p>Why was there no safety of­fi­cer to su­per­vise the dan­ger­ous op­er­a­tion?</p>
    <p>Even if they could lift the trunk, an ac­ci­den­tal slip or loss of bal­ance would put their lives at risk. The least the con­trac­tor could do was to de­ploy more men if the ba­sic tools were not avail­able.</p>
    <p>There was also no safe dis­tanc­ing as the work­ers had to group closely to­gether to do the lift­ing.</p>
    <p>It seems we are still not learn­ing how to treat mi­grant work­ers well. De­spite all the talk of the im­por­tance of for­eign work­ers’ safety at work, there are still con­trac­tors who care lit­tle for them.</p>
