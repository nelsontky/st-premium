    <p>LIT­TLE DIC­TA­TOR</p>
    <p>BARCELONA A frus­trated Lionel Messi said he is tired of be­ing blamed for prob­lems at Barcelona af­ter he was ac­cused by An­toine Griez­mann’s for­mer agent of mak­ing life dif­fi­cult for the France striker at the La Liga club.</p>
    <p>Eric Ol­hats had ac­cused Messi of hav­ing too much con­trol at the club, saying his “reign of ter­ror” had made life dif­fi­cult for his for­mer client since last year. The French­man has strug­gled since join­ing Barca from Atletico Madrid for €120 mil­lion (S$191 mil­lion). He scored just nine La Liga goals last term, the first time he did not hit dou­ble fig­ures since the 2011-12 season.</p>
    <p>“(Messi’s) at the same time em­peror and monarch, and he didn’t see An­toine’s ar­rival with a good eye,” Ol­hats told France Football. “His at­ti­tude has been de­plorable, he made him feel that... It is the regime of ter­ror. Ei­ther you are with him or you are against him...</p>
    <p>“(He is) as good on the pitch as he is bad off it. Barcelona has been suf­fer­ing for a while. There was a cancer in that club, and it ob­vi­ously leaves some marks.”</p>
    <p>Messi re­turned to Barcelona from in­ter­na­tional duty with Ar­gentina on Wed­nes­day when he was ac­costed by reporters at the air­port.</p>
    <p>“The truth is that I’m a lit­tle tired of al­ways be­ing the prob­lem for ev­ery­thing at the club,” Messi told Span­ish media.</p>
    <p>“On top of that, af­ter a 15-hour flight, I had the tax au­thor­i­ties wait­ing for me. It’s mad­ness.”</p>
    <p>With one year left on his con­tract, Messi tried to ac­ti­vate a dis­puted clause to leave Barcelona for free in the off-season, but even­tu­ally de­cided to stay to avoid fac­ing a le­gal bat­tle with the club.</p>
    <p>Barcelona have been in tur­moil since an 8-2 hu­mil­i­a­tion by Bay­ern Mu­nich in last season’s Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter-fi­nals. Club pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu re­signed last month ahead of a vote of no con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Messi has also had his run-ins with the Span­ish tax au­thor­i­ties in re­cent years. He was handed a 21-month prison sen­tence in 2016 and or­dered to pay a fine of €2 mil­lion for de­fraud­ing the Span­ish gov­ern­ment of €4.2 mil­lion over in­come earned from im­age rights. How­ever, he did not serve any jail time af­ter ex­chang­ing his sen­tence for a €250,000 fine.</p>
    <p>(He is) as good on the pitch as he is bad off it... There was a cancer in that club, and it ob­vi­ously leaves some marks.</p>
