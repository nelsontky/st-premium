    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Wed­nes­day re­fused to guar­an­tee that he will trans­fer power if he loses the Novem­ber elec­tion, earn­ing scorn from Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den and even from within his own party.</p>
    <p>“Well, we’re go­ing to have to see what hap­pens,” Mr Trump re­sponded when asked at a White House press con­fer­ence about whether he is com­mit­ted to the most ba­sic tenet of demo­cratic rule in the US – a peace­ful han­dover of power upon a change of pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who holds a steady lead over the Repub­li­can in­cum­bent in opin­ion polls ahead of the Nov 3 vote, ex­pressed in­credulity.</p>
    <p>“What coun­try are we in?” the former vice-pres­i­dent said, when asked about Mr Trump’s com­ment by re­porters. “Look, he says the most ir­ra­tional things. I don’t know what to say.”</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Mitt Rom­ney, a fre­quent but rare party critic of Mr Trump, went fur­ther, say­ing that any hes­i­ta­tion on the core con­sti­tu­tion guar­an­tee was “un­think­able and un­ac­cept­able”. “Fun­da­men­tal to democ­racy is the peace­ful tran­si­tion of power; without that, there is Be­larus,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>Be­laru­sian leader Alexan­der Lukashenko yes­ter­day re­sponded de­fi­antly to the Euro­pean Union and the US which re­fused to recog­nise his in­au­gu­ra­tion as pres­i­dent, cit­ing rigged polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump fol­lowed up his re­marks – un­prece­dented in mod­ern times for a US pres­i­dent – by re­sum­ing his near-daily com­plaint about the fair­ness of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently re­fer­ring to the in­creased use of mail-in bal­lots due to the coronaviru­s pan­demic, he said: “You know that I’ve been com­plain­ing very strongly about the bal­lots and the bal­lots are a disaster.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump fre­quently claims that mail-in bal­lots are vul­ner­a­ble to mass fraud and are be­ing en­cour­aged by Democrats to rig the elec­tion. But there is no ev­i­dence that the prac­tice had ever led to sig­nif­i­cant fraud in US elections.</p>
    <p>At the press con­fer­ence, Mr Trump seemed to sug­gest an­nulling what are ex­pected to be the huge num­bers of mailed-in bal­lots, not­ing that in such a sce­nario, he would re­main in power.</p>
    <p>“Get rid of the bal­lots and you’ll have a very peace­ful – there won’t be a trans­fer, frankly. There’ll be a con­tin­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>His latest in­sis­tence that there can­not be a free and fair pres­i­den­tial elec­tion came as pres­sure mounts over his plan to put a new, right-lean­ing jus­tice on the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is set to nom­i­nate a re­place­ment tomorrow for lib­er­al­lean­ing jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg who died last week. His Repub­li­can Party, which has a ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate, is ex­pected to quickly con­firm the nom­i­nee. If it suc­ceeds, the nine-jus­tice court would likely have a strongly pro-con­ser­va­tive bent for years to come.</p>
    <p>Democrats say the process should wait un­til the re­sult of the elec­tion is known, al­low­ing the winner to shape the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>With Mr Trump and the Repub­li­cans mount­ing a se­ries of court chal­lenges against the use of mail-in bal­lots, the chances of a con­tested elec­tion re­sult are con­sid­ered high. On Wed­nes­day, Mr Trump said he thinks the elec­tion “will end up in the Supreme Court”.</p>
    <p>WAIT AND SEE</p>
    <p>Well, we’re go­ing to have to see what hap­pens.</p>
