    <p>Sin­ga­pore-born Bri­tish writer Stephanie Scott ex­plores the role of love in her book about a pro­fes­sional home wrecker who falls for his mark and kills her. In­spired by a real-life case in Ja­pan a decade ago, the 37-year-old won­dered “if you could love some­one and kill them”, she told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Ten years ago in Ja­pan, a man was sen­tenced for mur­der­ing a wo­man.</p>
    <p>What gripped the world, how­ever, was that the mur­derer was a wakare­saseya agent, a pro­fes­sional mar­riage wrecker hired to se­duce the vic­tim by her own hus­band to gen­er­ate grounds for di­vorce.</p>
    <p>The wakare­saseya agent, how­ever, fell in love with his mark and she with him. Af­ter his ar­rest, he con­fessed: “I still love her.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-born Bri­tish writer Stephanie Scott read about this case in 2010. “I won­dered if that could pos­si­bly be true, if you could love some­one and kill them,” says the 37-year-old over the tele­phone from her home in London.</p>
    <p>A quote from Leo Tol­stoy’s Anna Karen­ina, the clas­sic Rus­sian novel about di­vorce, came to mind: “There are as many kinds of love, as there are hearts.”</p>
    <p>Thus was planted the seed for her de­but novel What’s Left Of Me Is Yours, a work of fic­tion that draws on, but departs sub­stan­tially from the 2010 case.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally wanted to ex­plore the role that love has in our lives, what it means to each of us and how some­one’s sur­vival can hinge on an­other per­son,” she says. “How we love and what we do in the name of love.”</p>
    <p>In What’s Left Of Me Is Yours, young lawyer Su­miko dis­cov­ers that her mother Rina was not killed in an ac­ci­dent when Su­miko was a child, as her grand­fa­ther had told her, but mur­dered.</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to get to the truth, Su­miko digs up se­crets that her grand­fa­ther had buried to spare her, learn­ing that her fa­ther had hired a wakare­saseya agent, Kaitaro, to break up his mar­riage with Rina, only for Kaitaro and Rina to fall in love.</p>
    <p>Scott was born in Sin­ga­pore to a</p>
    <p>Bri­tish fa­ther and Sin­ga­porean mother, and grew up in Woodleigh Park un­til she was sent to board­ing school at the age of 11.</p>
    <p>An affin­ity for both news and the law runs deep in her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Her ma­ter­nal grand­mother, Mrs Ros­alind Rat­nam, was the first fe­male part­ner of law firm Allen & Gled­hill, while both her grand­fa­thers, Mr Ron­ald Scott and Mr Saba Rat­nam, worked for The Straits Times as ST Group deputy man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and The Sun­day Times editor re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther, Mr Roger Scott, was gen­eral man­ager at Times Prin­ters.</p>
    <p>Stephanie Scott al­ways wanted to be a writer and stud­ied English lit­er­a­ture at univer­sity but, as “a good Sin­ga­porean daugh­ter”, got a job in in­vest­ment bank­ing and spent sev­eral years work­ing in fi­nance.</p>
    <p>She was of­fered a vice-pres­i­dent role, but de­cided in­stead to give it all up to pur­sue a cre­ative writ­ing master’s de­gree at Ox­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“My fa­ther was shout­ing so much, I had to put down the phone,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>“But I knew this was what I’d al­ways wanted to do all my life, quite se­cretly – I’d never told any­body – and I re­alised that if I didn’t take the leap at that time, I might never have the op­por­tu­nity to do so again.”</p>
    <p>It took her 10 years to write the novel, dur­ing which she trav­elled to Ja­pan. She took up pho­tog­ra­phy, which Rina and Kaitaro bond over. She met Mr Richard Lloyd Parry, the Asia editor of The Times who cov­ered the 2010 mur­der trial, and in­ter­viewed lawyers and wakare­saseya agents.</p>
    <p>One of the break-up agents told her that, in many ways, he feels like a psy­chol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>Scott says: “I think there is still a great deal of dif­fi­culty in ac­cess­ing help for men­tal-health is­sues in Ja­pan. Peo­ple are of­ten left to deal with these re­la­tion­ship strug­gles alone, and they come to him.”</p>
    <p>Her re­search was so in-depth that she was awarded a Bri­tish As­so­ci­a­tion of Ja­panese Stud­ies Toshiba Stu­dentship for an­thro­po­log­i­cal work and was even made a mem­ber of the Bri­tish Ja­panese Law As­so­ci­a­tion, a rar­ity for a non-le­gal pro­fes­sional.</p>
    <p>When she rereads the novel to</p>
    <p>I re­ally wanted to ex­plore the role that love has in our lives, what it means to each of us and how some­one’s sur­vival can hinge on an­other per­son. How we love and what we do in the name of love.</p>
    <p>day, she still feels the phys­i­cal en­ergy of the scene of Rina’s mur­der “like a pol­ter­geist”.</p>
    <p>She says: “When I was writ­ing, I was very in­ter­ested in the way that mur­der vic­tims of­ten be­come de­fined by their deaths. I wanted to re­claim her story, I wanted her to be cel­e­brated for her life.”</p>
    <p>Scott and her hus­band con­tracted Covid-19 in April and she still feels its af­ter-ef­fects, such as breath­less­ness and fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>She had to do on­line au­thor events while ill. “You just put on a lot of make-up and pull it to­gether,” she quips. “Not quite how I planned to send my book out into the world – but it’s here now.”</p>
    <p>She hopes to write next a World War II novel set in Sin­ga­pore and Malaya. Both sides of her fam­ily were caught up in the war; her pa­ter­nal grand­fa­ther fought with the Bri­tish army in Burma, while her ma­ter­nal grand­mother hid from the in­vad­ing Ja­panese in rub­ber plan­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally in­ter­ested in look­ing at how my fam­ily came to­gether and ty­ing that into the devel­op­ment of Sin­ga­pore as a na­tion, gain­ing in­de­pen­dence,” she says.</p>
