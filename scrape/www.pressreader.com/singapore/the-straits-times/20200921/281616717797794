    <p>The late Ruth Bader Gins­burg was a pi­o­neer­ing ad­vo­cate for women’s rights i n the United States, a woman who cham­pi­oned gen­der equal­ity and broke down bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>Her ad­vo­cacy has pro­vided some food for thought as Sin­ga­pore em­barks on its re­view of women is­sues, and Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam cited her re­marks on the sub­ject yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to some 60 par­tic­i­pants from youth groups and women or­gan­i­sa­tions at a vir­tual di­a­logue to col­lect feed­back and rec­om­men­da­tions on gen­der equal­ity, Mr Shan­mugam said it is im­por­tant to “start with ac­cept­ing equal­ity”, with any dif­fer­en­tial treat­ment then hav­ing to be jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>“And equal­ity must not just be for­mal, but sub­stan­tive, and takes into ac­count the unique chal­lenges, needs that women face, and the spe­cific ef­fects that poli­cies have on them, to truly level the play­ing field.”</p>
    <p>Ask­ing the au­di­ence to con­sider this con­text, Mr Shan­mugam</p>
    <p>quoted Jus­tice Gins­burg as hav­ing said: “Women be­long in all places where de­ci­sions are be­ing made. It shouldn’t be that women are the ex­cep­tions.”</p>
    <p>The sec­ond woman to serve on the US Supreme Court, Jus­tice Gins­burg died last Fri­day at the age of 87 in her home in Washington.</p>
    <p>She was the first fe­male tenured pro­fes­sor at Columbia Law School, and founded the Women’s Rights Pro­ject at the Amer­i­can Civil Lib­er­ties Union.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said she was a “true ti­tan in the fight for women’s rights” in the US.</p>
    <p>In his key­note ad­dress yes­ter­day, the min­is­ter said that an­other les­son to be drawn from her work was the role that men can play, in recog­nis­ing the equal role of women, help­ing them ful­fil their po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>“On her late hus­band, Martin Gins­burg, she said this: ‘I have had the great for­tune to share a life with a part­ner truly ex­tra­or­di­nary for his gen­er­a­tion, a man who be­lieved at age 18 when we met, and who be­lieves today, that a woman’s work, whether at home or on the job, is as im­por­tant as a man’s.’”</p>
