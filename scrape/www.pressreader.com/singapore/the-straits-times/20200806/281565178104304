    <p>Home-grown singers JJ Lin and Stefanie Sun will per­form to­gether at a Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) show for the first time, de­liv­er­ing an English ver­sion of their in­ti­mate song Stay With You. The Man­dopop stars will per­form dur­ing the pa­rade’s evening show at The Star Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre at The Star Vista.</p>
    <p>Home-grown singers Stefanie Sun and JJ Lin will per­form to­gether at a Na­tional Day Pa­rade for the first time, singing an English ver­sion of their song Stay With You.</p>
    <p>The Man­dopop stars will per­form dur­ing the pa­rade’s evening show at The Star Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre at The Star Vista.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Sun, 42, will be singing Stay With You at the venue. Lin, 39, will be join­ing her vir­tu­ally in the duet.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal Man­darin ver­sion of the song was re­leased in Jan­uary in a trib­ute to front-line work­ers bat­tling the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Lin com­posed the tune while Sun wrote the lyrics. The English ver­sion of the song was cre­ated for this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade and is dedicated to the “un­sung he­roes in our lives”, says the pa­rade’s In­sta­gram page @nd­peeps.</p>
    <p>Lin wrote in an In­sta­gram post yes­ter­day: “2020 has been a dif­fi­cult year for us all. I hope this spe­cial ren­di­tion of Stay With You can kin­dle a sense of to­geth­er­ness no mat­ter where we are.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sun wrote: “To the peo­ple who have stayed where they are most needed and kept us safe, thank you.”</p>
    <p>This is not the first time the stars are in­volved in the pa­rade. In 2002, Sun sang the NDP theme song, We Will Get There. In 2015, Lin sang the Golden Ju­bilee NDP theme song, Our Sin­ga­pore. Both songs were com­posed by Dick Lee.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Sun and Lin, the evening show on Sun­day will fea­ture home­grown per­form­ers, such as singer­song­writ­ers Char­lie Lim and Nathan Hartono, rap­per Fariz Jabba and ac­tor-co­me­dian Hos­san Leong.</p>
    <p>The show will be aired on tele­vi­sion on Sun­day from 7pm. It com­prises six sec­tions, mostly de­voted to fea­tur­ing how Sin­ga­pore­ans have dealt with the ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The show will also fea­ture a vir­tual choir, com­posed of Sin­ga­pore­ans singing We Are Sin­ga­pore, and ren­di­tions of clas­sic NDP songs.</p>
    <p>The pledge will be re­cited in uni­son at 8.20pm and the show will con­clude with fire­work dis­plays across the is­land.</p>
    <p>The Aug 9 cel­e­bra­tions have a morn­ing por­tion that will in­clude a pa­rade at the Padang re­viewed by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob. Nu­mer­ous seg­ments of the pa­rade, such as the state flag fly-past, Red Li­ons parachutis­t jumps and a mo­bile col­umn, will take place at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions across the is­land, in­clud­ing heart­land ar­eas.</p>
