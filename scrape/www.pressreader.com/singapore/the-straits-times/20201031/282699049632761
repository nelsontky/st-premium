    <p>RACE 1 (2,000M)</p>
    <p>6 Cheer­ful Leader closed in nicely last start over the mile. The stepup to 2,000m will suit.</p>
    <p>1 London Hall is look­ing for backto-back wins. The book­ing of Alexis Badel bodes well.</p>
    <p>4 Blas­toise gets a handy 10lb (4.54kg) claim from the in-form ap­pren­tice jockey Jerry Chau.</p>
    <p>3 Vincy is rac­ing well. His chances are en­hanced with the book­ing of cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>8 Plik­clone, a last-start win­ner, re­mains in Class 5. If he can over­come the wide gate, he is the one to beat. 4 Apol­los Bow is the likely leader. He won well two starts ago and is ca­pa­ble of win­ning again.</p>
    <p>13 Tiger­lad is rac­ing with pur­pose in this grade. He slots in light with Karis Tee­tan aboard.</p>
    <p>3 Tele­com Mis­sile comes into this third-up. He is at his mark and gets the ser­vices of Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>5 My Su­gar missed by a just short head last start. With im­prove­ment, he is the one to beat.</p>
    <p>3 He­laku Knight turned his form around to fin­ish a close sec­ond last time. He can score any time.</p>
    <p>2 Golden Link is on the up. He can fin­ish strongly with even luck.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>9 Sparky Star is a tal­ent. The stepup in trip should see him run a bold race.</p>
    <p>4 Tele­com Rocket has been a model of con­sis­tency. He is un­lucky not to be a win­ner al­ready.</p>
    <p>1 Kasi Farasi skipped clear in a re­cent trial. He has only to trans­late that form in the race.</p>
    <p>6 Go Goal Toby is look­ing for back-to-back wins. He is drawn well and should get his chance.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>6 Re­ward­ing To­gether is a tal­ent who has been im­pres­sive against strong op­po­si­tion. With an eye­catch­ing trial, he is the one to beat. 3 Galac­tic is look­ing for back-to­back wins. He has gone to a new level this term.</p>
    <p>1 Pe­ga­sus Glory got off the mark im­pres­sively last start at only his sec­ond Hong Kong start. The form out of his last win is strong.</p>
    <p>2 Mon­key Jewellery is next best. He just needs to over­come the awk­ward gate.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>7 Best For You is con­sis­tent. He holds a blis­ter­ing per­sonal best over this course and dis­tance. He is a two-time Class 4 win­ner.</p>
    <p>11 Au­then­tic Champ is aided by the step-up in trip. But he will need luck from the rear of the field. 5 Mar­velous Fans took to the step-up in trip with ease. He can fig­ure again with the right run.</p>
    <p>8 Sam’s Love finds a dif­fi­cult con­test but does get the ser­vices of Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>3 Hong Kong Win is a two-time course-and-dis­tance win­ner. He has been sound this term and is close to his peak.</p>
    <p>5 Duke Wai shot up 33 rat­ings points last term with four straight wins. The con­cern is run­ning firstup but his lat­est trial was good.</p>
    <p>8 Mas­sive Pocket, a Class 2 win­ner, has got up in the rat­ings. He will get his chance to rattle home. 10 Mul­ti­mil­lion is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>GROUP 3 SA SA LADIES’ PURSE HAND­I­CAP</p>
    <p>5 Dances With Dragon’s last-start fast-clos­ing fifth sug­gests that he is ready to peak. He scored a near five-length win in the Group 3 Premier Plate over 1,800m last term. If he repli­cates that run, he is the one to beat.</p>
    <p>2 South­ern Leg­end won this race last year and looks well placed. He will rel­ish the added dis­tance and has to off­set only the awk­ward gate to be a lead­ing player.</p>
    <p>12 Savvy Nine slots with no weight on his back. He is go­ing in with an im­pres­sive trial.</p>
    <p>1 Ex­ul­tant re­turns af­ter two Group 1 wins. He will be able to fin­ish off de­spite be­ing more ef­fec­tive over longer dis­tances.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>4 Win­ning For All put in a ca­reerbest ef­fort at his third Hong Kong start ear­lier this month. He ap­pears ready to be­gin his as­cent up the hand­i­cap.</p>
    <p>3 Tran­scen­dent’s best as­set is his clos­ing speed. If he is rid­den a touch qui­eter, he will get his chance to fin­ish home strongly.</p>
    <p>8 Scores Of Fun’s un­beaten streak snapped last time. He can bounce back de­spite an awk­ward gate.</p>
    <p>11 Like That is next best. He should rel­ish get­ting around a bend now.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>12 True Leg­end fin­ished close-up last time. If he man­ages to repli­cate that per­for­mance, he is the one to beat.</p>
    <p>9 An­gel Of My Eyes is look­ing for his third win from four starts. But he is vul­ner­a­ble step­ping up to Class 3 with an awk­ward gate.</p>
    <p>4 E Star can fight on as he has done pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>2 Gift Of Life­line is next best.</p>
