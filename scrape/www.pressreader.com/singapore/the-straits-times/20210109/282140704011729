    <p>Crises are turn­ing points. And for Amer­ica’s ail­ing democ­racy, Wed­nes­day’s siege of the United States Capi­tol may prove to be a mo­ment not of reck­on­ing, but of re­demp­tion.</p>
    <p>Since his sur­prise suc­cess in the Repub­li­can pri­maries, Mr Don­ald Trump’s of­ten out­ra­geous be­hav­iour had wedged es­tab­lish­ment Repub­li­cans in an un­com­fort­able po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Rat­tled by his vis­ceral ap­peal, and wary of ca­reer sui­cide, chal­lenges in fu­ture pri­maries, or lost op­por­tu­ni­ties for Repub­li­can Supreme Court nom­i­nees, many of them cal­cu­lated it was bet­ter to en­dure for the per­ceived greater good.</p>
    <p>These Repub­li­cans joined the Pres­i­dent in spout­ing the out­ra­geous, sup­ported the un­sup­port­able, un­sure of a po­lit­i­cal fu­ture staked on truth and democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Still, a steady trickle of Repub­li­can de­fec­tors – from anony­mous au­thors in The New York Times to for­mer se­nior of­fi­cials with tell-all me­moirs – moved to check Mr Trump’s worst ex­tremes, ges­tur­ing to like-minded Repub­li­can col­leagues who just lacked the moral and po­lit­i­cal courage to speak out.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers claimed to hold their tongues in the hope of check­ing the Pres­i­dent’s worst ex­cesses. These held tongues helped Mr Trump hold the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Fear, self-re­gard and ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion are friends of tyrants and bul­lies ev­ery­where. But now Amer­ica needs those Repub­li­cans to take courage and stand up.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the way its po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is struc­tured, if Amer­i­can democ­racy is to sur­vive, it needs a rea­son­able, law-abid­ing al­ter­na­tive to the Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>For sta­bil­ity, both par­ties must con­test the mid­dle ground first, and ap­peal to the fringes only care­fully. That means Mr Trump’s power needs to break closer to the fringe, if the Repub­li­can Party is to</p>
    <p>es­cape his con­trol.</p>
    <p>That he re­tains con­trol at all is unusual. Most pres­i­dents who lose elec­tions are lame ducks. But Mr Trump’s cult of per­son­al­ity has no term lim­its. The spec­ta­cle of ex­cess he en­gi­neered formed a wel­come re­lief for some Amer­i­cans from the hum­drum, and from so­cial and eco­nomic woes.</p>
    <p>For oth­ers, Mr Trump pro­vided a re­lease for sti­fled rage, racism and anti-gov­ern­ment sen­ti­ment. Repub­li­can law­mak­ers who had over­come their dis­taste wor­ried about the po­lit­i­cal base. And with whis­pers of a Trump me­dia em­pire to come, on which they might be de­pen­dent, con­tin­u­ing to toe the line seemed sen­si­ble. Un­til Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In in­sti­gat­ing an armed at­tack on Amer­ica’s elected of­fi­cials, com­plete with pipe bombs tar­get­ing both par­ties’ head­quar­ters, Mr Trump crossed a line. Peo­ple died. Many watched in dis­be­lief. Oth­ers said, “well, what did you ex­pect?”, and still oth­ers saw, in this breach, the end of Amer­i­can democ­racy.</p>
    <p>SEP­A­RAT­ING FROM TRUMP</p>
    <p>But a cri­sis is a turn­ing point, a crux. In grass­roots rev­o­lu­tions – Ber­lin 1989, Minsk 2020 – fear of tyrants pre­vents most from com­ing out in the street. Then some cat­a­lyst brings out a brave few. See­ing them, oth­ers join. Then comes the tip­ping point, and enough stand up that this brav­ery is nor­malised, ap­pears rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>The move­ment be­comes sus­tain­able, grows cycli­cally.</p>
    <p>Could the siege of the Capi­tol be such a cat­a­lyst? It would be fool­hardy to think Trump­ism, its con­spir­a­cies and lies will soon dis­ap­pear. Even in the wake of in­sur­rec­tion, more than 100 Repub­li­can mem­bers of Congress, play­ing to their base, con­tin­ued to base­lessly ob­ject to elec­toral votes for Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>For many on the vi­o­lent fringe, Trump­ism is an iden­tity, and ideas hitched to iden­ti­ties are of­ten in­tractable.</p>
    <p>But most Repub­li­can politi­cians needed, knew they needed, and were des­per­ate for, some politicall­y vi­able means of re­turn­ing to the cen­tre. They needed an ex­cuse to sep­a­rate them­selves from Mr Trump. The siege of Amer­ica’s Capi­tol pro­vided just this chance.</p>
    <p>As we have ex­pe­ri­enced in the cur­rent pan­demic, we can be­come de­sen­si­tised to – even when we are ex­hausted by – all kinds of ex­tremes. This was the case with Mr Trump’s be­hav­iour. It was easy to just go along.</p>
    <p>But here were armed men and women, wield­ing base­ball bats and knives, smash­ing win­dows, van­dal­is­ing, de­fac­ing and threat­en­ing those the Amer­i­can peo­ple had elected to rep­re­sent them, along with their staff.</p>
    <p>And they did this in or­der to sub­vert the demo­cratic process. They did this at the in­sti­ga­tion of the Pres­i­dent who swore an oath to “pre­serve, pro­tect and de­fend</p>
    <p>the Con­sti­tu­tion”.</p>
    <p>The siege was so ex­plicit, so ex­treme and so bluntly fac­tual that it be­lied the abil­ity of the news pun­dits to nor­malise. There was no way to say “oh, there Trump goes again!” or “we’ve seen all this be­fore”.</p>
    <p>REPUB­LI­CANS PUSH BACK</p>
    <p>The siege of the Capi­tol shows Repub­li­cans are – fig­u­ra­tively – mov­ing into the street in protest against Trump­ism. The more who come, the more Mr Trump is marginalis­ed, the more will fol­low.</p>
    <p>The mood in a chas­tened Se­nate on Wed­nes­day night sug­gested as much. Even long-time Trump al­lies like Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell and South Carolina Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Graham strongly and di­rectly con­demned the in­sur­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can es­tab­lish­ment out­side the cham­bers chimed in too. Nu­mer­ous ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials re­signed. For­mer pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush did not mince words even if he did not name Mr Trump in his con­dem­na­tion of the “sick­en­ing and heart­break­ing” may­hem at the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>“In­sur­rec­tion could do grave dam­age to our na­tion and rep­u­ta­tion,” he said. “In the United States of Amer­ica, it is the fun­da­men­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity of ev­ery pa­tri­otic cit­i­zen to sup­port the rule of law. To those who are dis­ap­pointed in the re­sults of the elec­tion: Our coun­try is more</p>
    <p>im­por­tant than the pol­i­tics of the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Even Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence broke ranks, if more cau­tiously. Face­book and Twit­ter, long hes­i­tant to shut Mr Trump down, did so.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­cans only now break­ing from Mr Trump are not he­roes. They en­abled this cri­sis in the first place. In­dulging his lies, slan­ders and ex­cesses, they threat­ened the democ­racy they swore to pro­tect.</p>
    <p>But Amer­ica needs Repub­li­cans them­selves to push back vi­o­lence and vi­cious­ness to the fringe, and re­claim their share of the cen­tre. And per­haps it took some­thing this ex­treme to show them their cal­cu­lus had been mis­taken.</p>
    <p>Will we see a cyclic de­fla­tion of rhetoric, the restora­tion of the rea­son­able to the main­stream? Will the events on Wed­nes­day have been the tip­ping point? Time will tell.</p>
    <p>But as more and more come out into the street against Mr Trump, the po­lit­i­cal cost of join­ing grows lower and lower. The storm­ing of the Capi­tol may turn out to have been just the re­demp­tive mo­ment Amer­ica so badly needed.</p>
