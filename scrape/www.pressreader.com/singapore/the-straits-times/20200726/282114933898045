    <p>Spe­cial needs teacher Yeo Koon Long (right) picked up pro­gram­ming a few years ago be­cause he wanted to help chil­dren with autism com­mu­ni­cate more ef­fec­tively through tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>At a pre­vi­ous school, he re­alised that although the stu­dents could not speak, they were “very cog­ni­tively able” and could com­mu­ni­cate through typ­ing or point­ing at pic­tures on an Ap­ple iPad.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo, 30, wanted to cre­ate a pro­gramme that could help them ful­fil sim­ple tasks, such as or­der­ing food on their own.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the first ben­e­fi­cia­ries of his new-found skill turned out to be a very dif­fer­ent group.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Mr Yeo launched meal claim and do­na­tion plat­form Sec­ond­meal, which was in­spired by cafes over­seas, where pa­trons can buy an ad­di­tional meal or drink for some­one in need.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to pro­mote this sys­tem in Sin­ga­pore, but was afraid peo­ple would abuse it to claim free food. I re­alised there was a need for a dig­i­tal sys­tem to pre­vent this.”</p>
    <p>He col­lab­o­rated with non-profit group Happy Peo­ple Help­ing Peo­ple (HPHP), which sup­ports el­derly ben­e­fi­cia­ries, many of whom are card­board col­lec­tors.</p>
    <p>The group usu­ally dis­trib­utes do­na­tions, such as su­per­mar­ket vouch­ers and es­sen­tial items, to the el­derly ben­e­fi­cia­ries. It was a nat­u­ral step to add meal do­na­tions into the mix.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with HPHP vol­un­teers, Mr Yeo dis­trib­uted QR codes that al­low the el­derly to claim free meals at about 30 stalls around the is­land, a third of which are ha­lal.</p>
    <p>Meals are paid for by donors and tracked via a sta­tus bar on the Sec­ond­meal web­site. This shows how many meals have been do­nated that month and if there is a sur­plus or short­fall. Donors can also check when their meals were claimed.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of trans­parency, so peo­ple see where their do­na­tion is go­ing and feel like the sys­tem is ac­count­able,” says Mr Yeo.</p>
    <p>Af­ter run­ning Sec­ond­meal for three years, he be­gan won­der­ing about the fu­ture di­rec­tion of the plat­form when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck. Do­na­tions poured in and other non-profit groups wanted to col­lab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond­meal be­gan work­ing with other ini­tia­tives to pro­vide meals for other vul­ner­a­ble groups.</p>
    <p>These in­clude taxi driv­ers whose in­come has taken a hit, and for­eign­ers such as so­cial visit pass hold­ers and stu­dents stranded in Sin­ga­pore be­cause of bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Even as the coro­n­avirus abates, Mr Yeo has found a sec­ond wind. He in­tends to ex­pand the pool of ben­e­fi­cia­ries as well as rope in more in­de­pen­dent, fam­ily-run hawker stalls as meal providers to give their busi­ness a boost.</p>
    <p>“The goal is to con­tinue feed­ing more peo­ple with the sys­tem,” he says.</p>
