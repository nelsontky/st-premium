    <p>When Ms Pamela Chng de­cided to take a year off work due to burnout, it made her wake up and smell the cof­fee.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ing it was time to quit her job run­ning a Web con­sul­tancy, she had the idea of start­ing her own busi­ness – and us­ing it as a force for good.</p>
    <p>Ten years later, she has done just that. Bettr Barista, her cof­fee firm which cham­pi­ons so­cially re­spon­si­ble prac­tices, has earned her a nom­i­na­tion for The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year 2020 award.</p>
    <p>“The so­cial busi­ness model spoke to me,” said Ms Chng, 44. “I felt that a busi­ness’ role in so­ci­ety is not just to max­imise profit, but think about how it can cre­ate a con­di­tion where peo­ple can work hap­pily and healthily and im­pact oth­ers in a pos­i­tive way.”</p>
    <p>Com­bin­ing this phi­los­o­phy with her pas­sion for cof­fee, she founded Bettr Barista in 2011.</p>
    <p>Ms Chng also wanted to tackle the sys­temic is­sues in the cof­fee value chain, down to the farm­ers who grow the beans, and en­sure in­dus­try prac­tices were more equal and in­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>Bettr Barista now has eight out­lets across the is­land, a roast­ing fa­cil­ity and a cof­fee academy in Tai Seng.</p>
    <p>It also runs a four-month pro­gramme for vul­ner­a­ble women and at-risk youth, which teaches them vo­ca­tional skills and i ndepth life skills. The pro­gramme has had 27 in­takes since it started in Jan­uary 2012, and has helped about 150 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>While she is hum­bled to be nom­i­nated for Sin­ga­porean of the Year, Ms Chng said her work is a team ef­fort in­clud­ing staff, cor­po­rate part­ners, so­cial or­gan­i­sa­tions and even the Gov­ern­ment. She is grate­ful for their sup­port and col­lab­o­ra­tion over the years.</p>
    <p>“It’s very im­por­tant to recog­nise that change needs a col­lec­tive group of change­mak­ers. You can’t do it alone,” said Ms Chng.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of the cur­rent four­month pro­gramme has given Ms Chng and Bettr Barista courage to keep it grow­ing and ex­pand­ing.</p>
    <p>Next month, a two-month ac­cel­er­ated scheme – a Bettr Work Train­ing Pro­gramme – will be rolled out, aimed at 40 to 50 in­di­vid­u­als with fewer sup­port needs than those who at­tend the four­month pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>They will be given gen­eral food and bev­er­age sec­tor train­ing and skills for emo­tional health.</p>
    <p>Next year, the com­pany will also re­visit its plans to ex­pand into Myan­mar, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines, which were put on hold due to the pan­demic, and be­gin a sub­scrip­tion-based de­liv­ery model for its cof­fee.</p>
    <p>Ms Chng ad­vises oth­ers look­ing to set up so­cial en­ter­prises to un­der­stand their mo­ti­va­tion for do­ing it.</p>
    <p>“Run­ning a so­cial busi­ness is not for ev­ery­one,” she added. “A nor­mal busi­ness is hard, a so­cial busi­ness is twice as hard be­cause you have to also worry about the so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal bot­tom line, and cover the so­cial costs.</p>
    <p>“You have to be very clear as well, as to what prob­lem you are try­ing to solve.”</p>
