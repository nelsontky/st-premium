    <p>TOKYO • Ms Kana Amaya’s child­hood dream was to see the world while work­ing as a cabin at­ten­dant.</p>
    <p>The jet-setter, who has vis­ited coun­tries like the United States and the Philip­pines, has also picked up lan­guage skills that she hoped to be able to use on the job.</p>
    <p>Be­sides her na­tive Ja­panese, she speaks English and Thai.</p>
    <p>But the 22-year-old’s as­pi­ra­tions were crushed by t he Covid-19 pan­demic, which has led to a freeze on hir­ing in the global avi­a­tion i ndustry. Ms Amaya says she ap­plied to do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional car­ri­ers, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Emi­rates, to no avail.</p>
    <p>“I was so frus­trated and felt so de­spon­dent that my tears could not stop fall­ing,” she told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“I had no other j ob as­pi­ra­tions, no idea what I wanted to do, or what I would even be in­ter­ested in do­ing.”</p>
    <p>The prospect of leav­ing school with­out a job of­fer – she grad­u­ates from the Kanda Univer­sity of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in March – weighed greatly on her, she said.</p>
    <p>But there was no other choice and she be­gan job hunt­ing in earnest.</p>
    <p>Ms Amaya has since been of­fered a job by a semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­turer and will start work next April.</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to make the most of her sit­u­a­tion, she says she is now try­ing to learn the ins and outs of the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Pri­mar­ily, I wanted to be in a global com­pany where I can po­ten­tially use my l an­guage skills,” she said, though adding quickly that she has not ruled out pur­su­ing her cabin at­ten­dant dreams after the pan­demic dies down.</p>
    <p>But prag­ma­tism might have set in. She said: “I do have con­cerns over the un­cer­tainty, and can­not help but won­der if any chances for a ca­reer switch might de­crease.”</p>
    <p>She added: “But I will be let­ting my­self down if I don’t do my best. If I find the work re­ward­ing and chal­leng­ing, I will prob­a­bly stay on. Be­com­ing a flight at­ten­dant is a dream, but it’s also valu­able to have an en­vi­ron­ment where I am mo­ti­vated to do my best.”</p>
