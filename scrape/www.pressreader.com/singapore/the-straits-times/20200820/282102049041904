    <p>A man and a wo­man were killed in an ac­ci­dent in­volv­ing a car and a mo­tor­cy­cle on Tampines Ex­press­way (TPE) to­wards Sele­tar Ex­press­way on Tues­day evening.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said the 62-year-old mo­tor­cy­clist and the pil­lion rider, a 59-year-old wo­man, were pro­nounced dead at the scene by a para­medic.</p>
    <p>The car driver, a 31-year-old man, and his three pas­sen­gers aged be­tween 10 and 28 were con­scious when they were taken to Sengkang Gen­eral Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they were alerted to the ac­ci­dent at 4.23pm.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are con­tin­u­ing.</p>
    <p>The af­ter­math of the in­ci­dent was cap­tured on video and posted on the Face­book page of road safety com­mu­nity Beh Chia Lor – Sin­ga­pore Road.</p>
    <p>The video shows a badly dam­aged mo­tor­cy­cle ly­ing on its side and a car with its bumper dented.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent re­sulted in a mas­sive jam along the TPE with three out of four lanes on the ex­press­way closed off.</p>
