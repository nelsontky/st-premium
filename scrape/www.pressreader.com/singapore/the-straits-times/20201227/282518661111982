    <p>If you are look­ing for a more tan­gi­ble in­vest­ment on tech­nol­ogy, how about elec­tric cars?</p>
    <p>The stock mar­ket has never seen any­thing quite like Tesla.</p>
    <p>Led by the mer­cu­rial bil­lion­aire Elon Musk, the elec­tric-car maker’s shares have soared roughly 14,000 per cent since it went pub­lic a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Even amid an econ­omy-roil­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic it’s up roughly 700 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>And now, a com­pany that has pro­voked years of equally in­tense fan­dom and crit­i­cism among money man­agers and tech bros the world over has just been added to the S&P 500 – tra­di­tion­ally a marker of cor­po­rate ma­tu­rity.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is the largest ever added to the in­dex, and, with a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of US$650 bil­lion (S$864 bil­lion), the sud­den weight it will throw into the US stock mar­ket could have strange con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies worth a frac­tion of Tesla would have been in­cluded in the in­dex long ago, but the ap­proach that has made it such a valu­able com­pany has brought chal­lenges. De­spite all its tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions, Mr Musk’s celebrity aura and a high-risk, high-re­ward ap­proach to busi­ness, Tesla for the long­est time was un­able to meet the most hum­drum re­quire­ment of cor­po­rate Amer­ica: turn­ing a profit.</p>
    <p>Cri­te­ria for in­clu­sion re­quire the sum of the com­pany’s fully au­dited prof­its in the four most re­cent quar­ters to be pos­i­tive. Tesla hit that mark only this year.</p>
    <p>Tesla was never short on am­bi­tion, though. From the be­gin­ning, it pro­posed to com­pete di­rectly with the world’s big­gest car­mak­ers by slowly rolling out a lineup of all-elec­tric vehicles at a time when the tech­nol­ogy seemed im­prac­ti­cal. Gen­eral Mo­tors’ elec­tric EV1 had gone the way of the di­nosaur a decade ear­lier, and Tesla’s plan seemed wildly un­re­al­is­tic for a start-up that wanted to com­pete with Detroit.</p>
    <p>But the mes­sianic mys­tique of Mr Musk, a chief ex­ec­u­tive/hype man in the vein of Ap­ple’s Steve</p>
    <p>Jobs, was al­lur­ing. He sold a vi­sion that gave Tesla an end­less appetite for in­vestor cash, and pockets both deep and shal­low bought it: Over the years, the com­pany pulled in cap­i­tal from ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists, bond mar­kets and stock in­vestors, and in­spired a wave of ca­sual in­vestors once it went pub­lic.</p>
    <p>But many in­vestors won’t ac­tu­ally have a choice about buy­ing Tesla’s shares.</p>
    <p>The S&P 500 is one of the most widely fol­lowed barom­e­ters of the stock mar­ket in the United States, serv­ing as the bench­mark against which in­vestors mea­sure more than US$11 tril­lion worth of in­vest­ments. More than US$4.5 tril­lion of those in­vest­ments are in in­dex funds de­signed to mir­ror the stocks in the S&P.</p>
    <p>Those funds have been buy­ing up shares of Tesla since mid-Novem­ber in prepa­ra­tion for Tesla’s ad­mis­sion to the S&P 500, which has sent its shares up over 60 per cent since the an­nounce­ment that the com­pany would be in­cluded.</p>
    <p>S&P Dow Jones In­dices, which owns the in­dex, con­sid­ered phas­ing in Tesla to make it eas­ier for in­dex funds to add the shares they need. The prospect of large parts of the in­vest­ing pub­lic hav­ing to buy large amounts of a sin­gle stock all at once can in­tro­duce volatil­ity into a share price, if it’s not sufficient­ly liq­uid. But the com­pany de­cided there would be enough avail­able to do it all at once.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of its sheer size – it’s roughly US$100 bil­lion larger than Mr War­ren Buf­fett’s Berk­shire Hath­away – Tesla will im­me­di­ately be one of the most in­flu­en­tial stocks in the in­dex, which is weighted by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion ad­justed for the num­ber of shares avail­able to be traded.</p>
    <p>Although smaller than the big­gest tech com­pa­nies – Mi­crosoft, Ap­ple, Ama­zon, Al­pha­bet and Face­book, which are to­gether worth tril­lions of dol­lars and ac­count for over 20 per cent of the in­dex – Tesla is widely ex­pected to ac­count for about 1.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Tesla is a grab­ber as far as head­lines go, and it’s go­ing to have an im­pact in the pric­ing” of the in­dex, said Mr Howard Sil­verblatt, se­nior in­dex an­a­lyst for S&P Dow Jones In­dices.</p>
    <p>And Tesla moves around a lot. On Feb 3, Tesla rock­eted up nearly 20 per cent on a rel­a­tively minor update about a joint ven­ture on bat­ter­ies turn­ing a profit. A cou­ple of days later, the stock took a 17 per cent nose­dive when a Tesla ex­ec­u­tive said the coro­n­avirus outbreak, then cen­tred in China, would ham­per de­liv­ery of vehicles from its plant in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust alone, Tesla rose nearly 75 per cent – but­tressed by strong numbers on ve­hi­cle de­liv­er­ies – only to col­lapse by more than 30 per cent in the open­ing days of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>There are dif­fer­ent the­o­ries about why Tesla moves so dra­mat­i­cally. Fi­nan­cial aca­demics would note the ex­tremely high val­u­a­tions in­vestors are putting on the prof­its they ex­pect Tesla to earn</p>
    <p>far in the fu­ture. Bet­ting on such far-off events gives added weight to rel­a­tively minor up­dates that could, over time, amount to big changes to the com­pany’s prof­itabil­ity. More hard-boiled mar­ket ob­servers point to the army of in­di­vid­ual in­vestors who hold Tesla shares – and may be more prone to buy­ing and sell­ing on the lat­est head­lines.</p>
    <p>Over the last five years, Tesla has been roughly 60 per cent more volatile than the S&P 500, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg data. And its chop­pi­ness has grown to be al­most 90 per cent more than the mar­ket’s volatil­ity this year.</p>
    <p>There’s rea­son to be­lieve Tesla will re­main volatile, at least in the short term. Some of the com­pany’s gains this year are a re­sult of bets in­vestors placed that Tesla would enter the S&P 500 and the in­dex funds would be forced to buy it.</p>
    <p>In a re­search note this month, an­a­lysts at JPMor­gan sug­gested they be­lieved Tesla’s price could come down once the com­pany was in­cluded in the in­dex. They rec­om­mended that in­vestors who want to add Tesla hold off from buy­ing right away.</p>
    <p>But there’s rea­son to be­lieve that Tesla will start to be­have a lit­tle more pre­dictably.</p>
    <p>For decades, aca­demics have stud­ied the be­hav­iour of stocks that are added to and pulled out of ma­jor in­dexes such as the S&P 500, un­cov­er­ing a num­ber of no­table ten­den­cies that they at­trib­uted to the so-called in­dex in­clu­sion phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>Some stud­ies have found that stocks tend to be­come more like the in­dex they’re added to, with share prices mov­ing more in lock step with the over­all in­dex. That makes sense: In­clu­sion in the S&P 500 changes the na­ture of a com­pany’s share­holder base. Af­ter Tesla is added, roughly 17 per cent of its shares avail­able for trade will be owned by in­vestors who merely own them be­cause they are in the in­dex, ac­cord­ing to anal­y­sis from Mor­gan Stan­ley.</p>
    <p>These pas­sive in­vestors don’t make de­ci­sions based on how an in­di­vid­ual com­pany is per­form­ing. In­stead, they buy and sell all 500 stocks in the in­dex as a group, de­pend­ing on whether money is flow­ing into their funds or out of them. Over time, this can mean the shares of com­pa­nies in the in­dex tend to move more as a group.</p>
    <p>“As the stock gets in­cluded, its volatil­ity goes down,” said Pro­fes­sor Anna Pavlova of the Lon­don Busi­ness School who has stud­ied in­dex in­clu­sions. “That’s the dom­i­nant ef­fect.”</p>
