    <p>A war­rant of ar­rest has been is­sued against a teenage girl who was part of an un­law­ful gath­er­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break af­ter she failed to turn up in a district court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Aqlima Ab­dul Azmi, 19, was ex­pected to be sen­tenced but was nowhere to be found when a court of­fi­cer called out her name.</p>
    <p>On Aug 25, the teenager and two oth­ers – Sai Raghu Vaish­navee Ragu, 19, and Mo­ham­mad Zack Da­nial Ahamad Zaki, 20 – each pleaded guilty to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act af­ter they took part in the gath­er­ing at a fit­ness cor­ner near Block 42 Beo Cres­cent, off Have­lock Road, in June.</p>
    <p>Sai Raghu and Zack turned up in court yes­ter­day to ap­pear be­fore Deputy Prin­ci­pal District Judge Seah Chi-Ling.</p>
    <p>Zack, who was un­will­ing to be placed on pro­ba­tion, was fined $3,000. Sai Raghu was sen­tenced to a year’s pro­ba­tion.</p>
    <p>Four other guests – Nur Sal­iza Mo­hamed Sani, 23, Nu­rul Sheilla Nata­sya Suhaimi, 25, Nu­raznie Ith­nin, 31, and Muham­mad Zaki Jo­hari, 33 – had ear­lier ad­mit­ted to sim­i­lar charges. They were each fined $4,000 in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen peo­ple, in­clud­ing two mi­nors, at­tended the il­le­gal gath­er­ing which lasted un­til the wee hours of June 28.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had ear­lier said that the youngest guest, a 14-year-old boy, was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing.</p>
    <p>Two oth­ers, a 15-year-old youth and a 26-year-old Malaysian man, were in­ves­ti­gated for un­re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing three oth­ers are still pend­ing. They are Mo­hamad Iman Ab­dul Rahim, 19, Remy Shah Hail Mee, 20, and Norsyahmi Norhe­sham, 21.</p>
    <p>As part of phase two of the re­open­ing, which took ef­fect on June 19, each house­hold can re­ceive up to five vis­i­tors a day.</p>
    <p>This means groups of up to five peo­ple can also meet out­side homes, such as at restau­rants for meals. They should, how­ever, prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing and avoid mix­ing be­tween dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Zaki and Zack had planned to con­sume al­co­holic drinks on the evening of June 27.</p>
    <p>Zaki bought two bot­tles of liquor while Zack set up two por­ta­ble ta­bles at the fit­ness cor­ner. The gath­er­ing started at around 9pm that day.</p>
    <p>All of them, ex­cept for the two mi­nors, con­sumed al­co­hol there, the court heard. The gath­er­ing was so noisy that it kept a res­i­dent in a nearby flat awake.</p>
    <p>He alerted the po­lice shortly be­fore 1am and an of­fi­cer ar­rived at the scene. The gath­er­ing ended soon af­ter.</p>
