    <p>Cred­i­tors of in­sol­vent de­part­ment store Robin­son & Com­pany have con­firmed the ap­point­ment of liq­uida­tors as the firm be­gins clos­ing its last two stores – at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>More than half of the 440 cred­i­tors who are owed at least $31.7 mil­lion at­tended an on­line meet­ing yes­ter­day and ap­pointed cor­po­rate ad­vi­sory and re­struc­tur­ing firm Kor­daMen­tha’s Mr Cameron Dun­can and Mr David Kim to un­der­take the process of wind­ing up the firm.</p>
    <p>Sources told The Straits Times (ST) that the cash dis­tri­bu­tion to cred­i­tors is ex­pected to take place be­tween April and June next year.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral res­o­lu­tions were ap­proved by a ma­jor­ity of cred­i­tors in at­ten­dance in both num­ber and value, in­clud­ing ap­point­ing a com­mit­tee of inspection.</p>
    <p>Sources say the com­mit­tee in­cluded Swee Cheng Hold­ings, the land­lord of Robin­sons’ The Heeren out­let which is owed the largest amount – $7.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for The Heeren man­age­ment told ST that it has re­ceived nu­mer­ous ex­pres­sions of in­ter­est for the retail space, adding: “We are ex­plor­ing our op­tions.”</p>
    <p>Cred­i­tors at yes­ter­day’s meet­ing were also given a state­ment of the com­pany’s af­fairs, in­clud­ing to­tal as­sets and li­a­bil­i­ties, along with a list of cred­i­tors and their es­ti­mated claims.</p>
    <p>Lendlease Retail In­vest­ment 3 and an en­tity linked to RCS Trust are the next largest cred­i­tors, with both owed about $4.2 mil­lion each.</p>
    <p>Lendlease is the land­lord of Jem mall, where Robin­sons closed an out­let in Au­gust. RCS Trust owns Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The ex­act date for the clo­sure of the two stores will not be an­nounced at this stage, Kor­daMen­tha said, adding: “But the in­dica­tive time­lines are around mid- or endDe­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>“The clos­ing dates will de­pend on when the stores will run out of stock. Fur­ther, hav­ing flex­i­bil­ity will al­low for the re­turns to cred­i­tors by way of sales to be max­imised.”</p>
    <p>One cred­i­tor, the owner of a house­hold prod­ucts com­pany owed a six-fig­ure sum, told ST that there is a very slim chance of re­cov­ery. “Look­ing at the as­sets and li­a­bil­i­ties ra­tio, the as­sets are less than 10 per cent of the li­a­bil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing le­gal action is out as well. “How can I pay for le­gal fees? It is good money chas­ing af­ter bad.</p>
    <p>“I am think­ing whether to get a bank loan, how to de­lay pay­ment to my sup­pli­ers. We didn’t just lose our profit, but our cap­i­tal and in­ter­est. And ev­ery cred­i­tor is go­ing through this.”</p>
    <p>Ra­jah & Tann man­ag­ing part­ner Pa­trick Ang said cred­i­tors should not rush to take le­gal action as it is not pos­si­ble for them to be paid in pref­er­ence ahead of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“The ap­pro­pri­ate course of action would be for cred­i­tors to file their proof of debt with sup­port­ing doc­u­men­tary ev­i­dence. If the claim is ac­cepted by the liq­uida­tors, then there is no need for le­gal action,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If the claim is be­ing dis­puted, the cred­i­tor can still en­gage in dis­cus­sions with the liq­uida­tors to try to achieve a mu­tu­ally ac­cept­able res­o­lu­tion be­fore le­gal action is taken.”</p>
    <p>Most of Robin­sons’ cred­i­tors are un­se­cured, so they are likely to be paid on a pari passu ba­sis, mean­ing they will be paid equally, said Shook Lin & Bok part­ner Daniel Tan.</p>
    <p>“For the prod­ucts that have been con­signed to Robin­sons, it will de­pend on whether the ven­dor has re­tained ti­tle sub­ject to re­ceiv­ing pay­ment or ti­tle has al­ready passed to Robin­sons,” he added.</p>
    <p>“If ti­tle to the con­signed prod­ucts has al­ready passed to Robin­sons, then these as­sets will form part of the liq­ui­da­tion es­tate and go into the as­set pool for dis­tri­bu­tion.”</p>
    <p>A for­mer Robin­sons em­ployee who wanted to be known as Ms M said she was “angry” that she still does not know how much she will be com­pen­sated even though it has been al­most a month since the firm an­nounced its clo­sure.</p>
    <p>“We put in so much effort into our com­pany and this is what we get,” said Ms M, a mother of two who was laid off on Oct 29.</p>
    <p>“I hope I can find a lawyer but I can’t af­ford a le­gal team. I have al­ready got­ten in touch with the Min­istry of Man­power, Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment, Sin­ga­pore Man­ual and Mercantile Work­ers’ Union and ap­proached my MP. We don’t know who else we can ask for help,” she said.</p>
