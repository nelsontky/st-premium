    <p>WASHINGTON • Face­book has taken down a post by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, which it said vi­o­lated its rules against shar­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion about the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The post had a video clip, from an in­ter­view with Fox & Friends ear­lier on Wed­nes­day, in which Mr Trump claimed that chil­dren are “al­most im­mune” to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“This video in­cludes false claims that a group of peo­ple is im­mune from Covid-19, which is a vi­o­la­tion of our poli­cies around harm­ful Covid mis­in­for­ma­tion,” a Face­book spokesman said later that day.</p>
    <p>A tweet con­tain­ing the video that was posted by the Trump cam­paign’s @TeamTrump ac­count and shared by the Pres­i­dent was later hid­den by Twit­ter for break­ing its Covid-19 mis­in­for­ma­tion rules.</p>
    <p>A Twit­ter spokesman said the @TeamTrump ac­count owner would need to re­move the tweet be­fore they could tweet again.</p>
    <p>YouTube, through a spokesman, said it had also pulled down the video for vi­o­lat­ing its Covid-19 mis­in­for­ma­tion poli­cies.</p>
    <p>But the orig­i­nal i nter­view re­mains avail­able on the Fox News page on the plat­form. YouTube did not re­spond to re­quests to clar­ify which videos were taken down.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign ac­cused the com­pa­nies of bias, say­ing the Pres­i­dent had stated a fact.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies were un­fairly cen­sor­ing him. He told a ra­dio show yes­ter­day in Cleve­land that, “of course” he is be­ing cen­sored.</p>
    <p>“They’re do­ing any­body, on the right, any­body, any Repub­li­can, any con­ser­va­tive Repub­li­can is cen­sored and look at the hor­ri­ble things they say on the left,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion has said that while adults make up most of the known Covid-19 cases to date, some chil­dren and in­fants have been sick with the disease and they can also trans­mit it to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>An anal­y­sis by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion of six mil­lion cases be­tween Feb 24 and July 12 found that the share of chil­dren aged five to 14 was about 4.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a brief­ing at the White House, Mr Trump re­peated his claim that the virus had lit­tle im­pact on chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren han­dle it very well,” he told re­porters. “If you look at the num­bers, in terms of mor­tal­ity, fa­tal­i­ties... for chil­dren un­der a cer­tain age... their im­mune sys­tems are very, very strong and very pow­er­ful. They seem to be able to han­dle it very well and that’s ac­cord­ing to ev­ery sta­tis­ti­cal claim.”</p>
    <p>It was the first time Face­book had re­moved a Trump post for coro­n­avirus mis­in­for­ma­tion, the com­pany’s spokesman said.</p>
    <p>It also ap­peared to be the first re­ported in­stance of the so­cial me­dia com­pany tak­ing down a post from the Pres­i­dent for breach­ing its mis­in­for­ma­tion rules.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter has taken down a post retweeted by Mr Trump point­ing to a mis­lead­ing vi­ral video about the virus.</p>
