    <p>The dif­fer­ent ways in which Sin­ga­pore­ans came to­gether to pitch in dur­ing the pan­demic was the sub­ject of a panel dis­cus­sion at the Te­masek Trust Con­ver­sa­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These in­clude dis­tribut­ing thou­sands of care packs and the set­ting up of a new ra­dio sta­tion tai­lored to the needs of se­nior cit­i­zens – keep­ing them en­gaged and en­ter­tained and help­ing them bridge the dig­i­tal di­vide.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sion was hosted by phil­an­thropic group The Ma­ju­rity Trust ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Martin Tan. The pan­el­lists were Asia-Pa­cific lead of the In­ter­net giant Google’s char­i­ta­ble arm Mar­ija Ralic, Me­di­a­corp chief ex­ec­u­tive Tham Loke Kheng, Ninja Van Sin­ga­pore co­founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Lai Chang Wen and Vin­tage Ra­dio SG co-founder and Ra­dioac­tive man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and co­founder Aloy­sius Tan.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Trust is the phil­an­thropic arm of Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin Tan noted that one of the trends in phi­lan­thropy is the idea of the power of the col­lec­tive – col­lab­o­ra­tive phi­lan­thropy where dif­fer­ent part­ners come to­gether.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so will not just help to re­al­lo­cate re­sources more ef­fi­ciently, but also help to en­large the pie for ben­e­fi­cia­ries.</p>
    <p>The speak­ers shared about the ways their or­gan­i­sa­tions have played to their strengths in help­ing the vul­ner­a­ble and those in need amid the Covid-19 out­break here.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Me­di­a­corp as a na­tional me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tion put out public ed­u­ca­tion in the var­i­ous lan­guages, as well as help­ing to raise funds, said Ms Tham.</p>
    <p>Ninja Van, as a lo­gis­tics com­pany, tapped its na­tion­wide net­work of doorstep de­liv­ery fleets to phys­i­cally de­liver care packs to those in need.</p>
    <p>It also col­lab­o­rated with other part­ners who were bet­ter placed to raise aware­ness of the ini­tia­tive, such as by cre­at­ing so­cial me­dia cam­paigns – demon­strat­ing the spirit of col­lab­o­ra­tive phi­lan­thropy, said Mr Lai.</p>
    <p>The topic of col­lab­o­ra­tive phi­lan­thropy was also dis­cussed in a con­ver­sa­tion with Te­masek In­ter­na­tional ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive Dil­han Pil­lay San­drasegara, hosted by Mr Warren Fer­nan­dez, The Straits Times ed­i­tor and ed­i­tor-in-chief of the English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group at Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­nan­dez said col­lab­o­ra­tion was all about bring­ing part­ners to­gether to tackle a com­plex is­sue and de­vise so­lu­tions that could be im­ple­mented on a larger</p>
    <p>scale and at greater speed.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing up the point, Mr Pil­lay noted that this was how Te­masek tack­led the is­sue of trans­port­ing Covid-19 pa­tients dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The team at Te­masek, with part­ners such as SMRT, SBS Tran­sit and other trans­porta­tion com­pa­nies and engi­neer­ing com­pany Hope Tech­nik, man­aged to retro­fit more than 50 ve­hi­cles that could safely trans­port the pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that part­ner­ships re­quired trust, shared pur­pose and em­pa­thy if they were to work, Mr Fer­nan­dez asked Mr Pil­lay how this might best be fos­tered.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Mr Pil­lay said that forg­ing strong re­la­tion­ships is a multi-year in­vest­ment, and also called for a recog­ni­tion that as an in­di­vid­ual or­gan­i­sa­tion, “we don’t have all the skills and ca­pa­bil­i­ties re­quired”.</p>
    <p>“We have to aug­ment what we</p>
    <p>have with oth­ers. But what gets us to­gether has to be re­li­a­bil­ity and trust,” he said. A com­mon sense of pur­pose is also im­por­tant, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Pil­lay also elab­o­rated on Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion Des­mond Lee’s call for a cul­ture of reg­u­lar giv­ing to be cul­ti­vated, which would be a way of en­sur­ing ad­e­quate fund­ing for pro­grammes at so­cial ser­vice agen­cies.</p>
    <p>“Generous giv­ing is not about the amount but what you can af­ford to give... I think for us in Sin­ga­pore, many of us have been a ben­e­fi­ciary of the sys­tem we’ve had in place. This is a good time for us to give back,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also noted that tech­nol­ogy is also an en­abler for reg­u­lar giv­ing, mak­ing it eas­ier to do so. He added that tech­no­log­i­cal changes are also a driver in pro­mot­ing giv­ing, as it would en­able peo­ple and cor­po­ra­tions to give in new ways.</p>
