    <p>Beauty, health and well­ness re­tailer Wat­sons will soon start charg­ing cus­tomers who re­quest plas­tic bags 10 cents for each trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy will take ef­fect at all 100 Wat­sons stores here next Tues­day, said the re­tailer yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For now, the charge ap­plies only on Tues­days, which have been des­ig­nated by the re­tailer as a Bring Your Own Bag day.</p>
    <p>All pro­ceeds from the charge will be do­nated to World Wide Fund for Na­ture (WWF) Sin­ga­pore in sup­port of its con­ser­va­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Ms Irene Lau, manag­ing di­rec­tor of Wat­sons Sin­ga­pore, said: “As a ma­jor player in the health and beauty arena, we un­der­stand the re­spon­si­bil­ity we have to­wards the environmen­t.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing own­er­ship of our planet starts with small, con­sis­tent ac­tions, and that is where we are di­rect­ing our ef­forts to.”</p>
    <p>Last year, close to 13 mil­lion plas­tic bags were is­sued by the re­tailer.</p>
    <p>Wat­sons also aims to in­crease the recycled plas­tic con­tent in its plas­tic bags to 50 per cent by the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer’s Hong Kong­based par­ent com­pany A.S. Wat­son is one of 450 busi­nesses world­wide to sign the New Plas­tics Econ­omy Global Com­mit­ment, in which com­pa­nies pledge to re­duce plas­tic waste.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers who want to forgo plas­tic bags for a reusable one can pur­chase a Wat­sons shop­ping bag at $1.20 each.</p>
    <p>The reusable bag is made of 100 per cent re­cy­clable plas­tic and has been on sale since last month.</p>
    <p>Other re­tail­ers have also launched their own ini­tia­tives to re­duce plas­tic bag us­age.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­ket gi­ant FairPrice has ex­tended its “no plas­tic bag” ini­tia­tive for a year from Nov 12, fol­low­ing pos­i­tive re­sponses from cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers who visit cer­tain out­lets and re­quire plas­tic bags must pay 20 cents for each trans­ac­tion at FairPrice, FairPrice Finest and FairPrice Xtra su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The charge is 10 cents for each trans­ac­tion at Cheers and FairPrice Xpress con­ve­nience stores.</p>
    <p>There are 11 FairPrice, FairPrice Finest and FairPrice Xtra su­per­mar­kets, 12 Cheers stores and one FairPrice Xpress store tak­ing part in this ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, fash­ion chain H&M said in July last year that it will charge cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore 10 cents for each plas­tic or paper bag.</p>
    <p>All pro­ceeds from H&M’s shop­ping bag charge are do­nated to the WWF-Sin­ga­pore Plas­tic AC­Tion ini­tia­tive – an in­dus­try­wide ini­tia­tive to re­duce plas­tic use by 2030.</p>
