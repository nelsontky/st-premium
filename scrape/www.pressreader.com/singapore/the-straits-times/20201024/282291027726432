    <p>Lo­cal shares ended the week on a high, in tan­dem with Wall Street stocks that rose on hopes of a stim­u­lus pack­age.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket watch­ers noted that the fi­nal US pres­i­den­tial de­bate on Thurs­day was less chaotic than the first, but of­fered lit­tle in terms of new in­for­ma­tion on which way the vote counts were turn­ing.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times Index (STI) ended yes­ter­day up 0.4 per cent or 8.98 points at 2,537.39. De­clin­ers out­num­bered ad­vancers 213 to 177, with some 1.25 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $928.7 mil­lion hav­ing changed hands.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive in­vestor sen­ti­ment was ev­i­dent on Wall Street. The Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age and S&P 500 in­dices each gained 0.5 per cent, and the Nas­daq Com­pos­ite inched up 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ax­iCorp’s chief global mar­ket strate­gist Stephen Innes said: “Mar­kets are trad­ing higher, but cau­tiously in line with the cur­rent stim­u­lus, ‘be­fore-elec­tion’ theme as stocks ebb and flow on the un­wind and ro­ta­tions swivel.”</p>
    <p>He said Mr Joe Bi­den’s com­ments on a US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) “clean-en­ergy plan” should sup­port the nar­ra­tive that “the great­est amount of fis­cal stim­u­lus would ma­te­ri­alise un­der a Demo­cratic pres­i­dency and sweep of Con­gress”.</p>
    <p>Three out of four of the com­pa­nies un­der the Jar­dine Group were the top gain­ers on the Sin­ga­pore bourse. Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings (JMH) and Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings (JSH) again fin­ished in the top two spots. JMH gained 2.3 per cent to US$44.00 while JSH added 3.4 per cent to close at US$21.68.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Jar­dine Cy­cle and Car­riage rose 1.6 per cent to close at $18.91. Hongkong Land, how­ever, lost 1.1 per cent to close at US$3.77.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal off­shore and ma­rine group BH Global was the big­gest de­cliner of the day, clos­ing 34.1 per cent lower at $0.30.</p>
    <p>Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust was the big­gest loser among con­stituent stocks yes­ter­day, de­spite pos­i­tive news about its pri­vate place­ment to fi­nance its Asian ac­qui­si­tion spree worth $1.09 bil­lion. The place­ment was about 5.5 times cov­ered, with the is­sue price fixed at $2.027 per new unit. The counter closed 3.3 per cent lower at $2.05 on a cum­div­i­dend ba­sis.</p>
    <p>A few other real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) ended the week in the red. As­cen­das Reit lost 0.7 per cent to $3.08; Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust shed 0.5 per cent to $1.88, and Maple­tree Com­mer­cial Trust fell 0.5 per cent to $1.90.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Asia, mar­kets mostly ended higher. The Nikkei 225 rose 0.2 per cent; the Hang Seng index put on 0.5 per cent, and the broader Topix added 0.3 per cent. How­ever, the KLCI fell 0.3 per cent.</p>
