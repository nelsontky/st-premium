    <p>HOUS­TON • A hole-in-one helped Amy Ol­son grab the first-round lead in the US Women’s Open, the year’s fi­nal women’s Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>She shot a four-un­der 67 on Thurs­day at the Cham­pi­ons Golf Club for a one-shot l ead over Japan’s Hi­nako Shi­buno, Thai Moriya Ju­tanu­garn and South Korean Kim A-lim.</p>
    <p>“That hole-in-one was kind of the high­light of the round,” said world No. 68 Ol­son, who has never won an LPGA event. “I was pretty ex­cited to do that at the US Open.”</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old Amer­i­can, who be­gan on the back nine at the Cy­press Creek Course, aced the 16th hole with a 139-yard shot.</p>
    <p>South Korean Sung Yu-jin (76) achieved the same feat at the parthree fourth hole on the same course, mark­ing the seventh year in a row that at least one golfer had a hole-in-one in the Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>Ol­son kept up the mo­men­tum by notch­ing birdies on two of her next three holes, be­fore tak­ing the lead with a birdie on the par-three eighth.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pion Lee Jeongeun of South Korea shot a 73, putting her in a tie for 55th place.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­triot and world No. 1 Ko Jin-young also carded the same score, while sec­ond-ranked Kim Sei-young, who won her first Ma­jor ti­tle in Oc­to­ber at the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship, fired a 72.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of con­cerns about re­duced day­light, two lay­outs, in­clud­ing the Jackrab­bit Course, are be­ing used for the first two rounds.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal two rounds will be played on Cy­press Creek but the com­plex­ity led to only 23 of the 156 play­ers fin­ish­ing un­der par on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, US Women’s Open golf cour­ses are tough to learn, but try­ing to learn two tough cour­ses is def­i­nitely a big task for ev­ery­one this week,” said South Korean Park In-bee, a seven-time Ma­jor cham­pion who shot even par on Jackrab­bit. “But with the sun­light (lim­ited), we kind of have to do it.”</p>
    <p>The win­ner of the closed-door Ma­jor, pushed back from June due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, will earn US$1 mil­lion (S$1.33 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can An­drea Lee with­drew on Wed­nes­day be­cause of a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test, with Japan’s Ayaka Watan­abe tak­ing her spot in the field.</p>
