    <p>The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) con­tin­ues to be viewed as the most cred­i­ble po­lit­i­cal party, but its cred­i­bil­ity among vot­ers in all age groups slipped in this year’s gen­eral elec­tion com­pared with 2015.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, the Work­ers’ Party (WP) gained ground across the board, with big­ger in­creases among se­niors aged 65 and older, and those aged 30 to 34.</p>
    <p>A post-elec­tion sur­vey of vot­ers by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies also found that over­all, the cred­i­bil­ity rat­ings of all six po­lit­i­cal par­ties ranked in the sur­vey mir­rored the num­ber of votes they pulled in at the July 10 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter PAP, WP was found to be most cred­i­ble, fol­lowed, in de­clin­ing or­der, by the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP), Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party (SDP), Na­tional Sol­i­dar­ity Party (NSP) and Peo­ples Voice.</p>
    <p>PAP won 83 of the 93 seats and gar­nered 61.24 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote, down from 69.9 per cent five years ago.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, whose re­sults were dis­cussed at an on­line post-GE forum yes­ter­day, had polled 4,027 vot­ers.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar sur­vey was also con­ducted af­ter the 2006, 2011 and 2015 gen­eral elec­tions.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est sur­vey, PAP’s cred­i­bil­ity fell most among those aged 40 to 49. The pro­por­tion in this group who agreed or strongly agreed that the PAP is cred­i­ble fell 13 per­cent­age points from five years ago.</p>
    <p>In the 25 to 34 age bracket, a big­ger pro­por­tion saw WP as cred­i­ble com­pared with that for PAP. This was also true for Malay vot­ers.</p>
    <p>For those aged 25 to 29, about 86 per cent said WP was cred­i­ble, while the cor­re­spond­ing fig­ure for PAP was around 81 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, for vot­ers in the 30 to 34 age group, al­most 88 per cent said WP was cred­i­ble, against about 85 per cent for PAP.</p>
    <p>Among all four eth­nic cat­e­gories (Chi­nese, In­dian, Malay, Oth­ers), Malay re­spon­dents were the least likely to find PAP cred­i­ble, but most likely to find WP cred­i­ble.</p>
    <p>About 82 per cent of Malays found PAP cred­i­ble, com­pared with 87 per cent for WP.</p>
    <p>PAP’s cred­i­bil­ity rat­ing also dived among vot­ers liv­ing in one- to three-room Hous­ing Board flats and those whose monthly house­hold in­come is be­low $5,000.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, WP’s cred­i­bil­ity rose on both ends of the so­cioe­co­nomic spec­trum: A larger seg­ment of vot­ers in one- to three­room HDB flats, those with non-ter­tiary post-sec­ondary qual­i­fi­ca­tions, as well as PMETs (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians), rated it cred­i­ble.</p>
    <p>“These find­ings re­in­force the sense that the is­sue of liveli­hoods, es­pe­cially for the low- to mid­dlein­come house­holds, in­flu­enced sup­port for the PAP and WP,” said the re­search team.</p>
