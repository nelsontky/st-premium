    <p>• Scot­tish First Min­is­ter Ni­cola Stur­geon yes­ter­day told the EU that “we hope to join you again soon” as an in­de­pen­dent na­tion, fol­low­ing Bri­tain’s full de­par­ture from the bloc.</p>
    <p>“As an in­de­pen­dent mem­ber of the Euro­pean Union, Scot­land would be a part­ner and a bridge­builder,” she wrote on her party’s web­site.</p>
    <p>A com­fort­able ma­jor­ity of Scots voted to re­main in the EU dur­ing the 2016 Brexit ref­er­en­dum, giv­ing fresh im­pe­tus to the move­ment push­ing for Scot­land to leave the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>Af­ter los­ing the 2014 in­de­pen­dence vote, Ms Stur­geon, head of the Scot­tish Na­tional Party (SNP), is spear­head­ing the push for another ref­er­en­dum and hopes to re­join the EU should that hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“More and more peo­ple in Scot­land be­lieve our as­pi­ra­tions can best be met by con­tin­u­ing to con­trib­ute to the shared en­deav­our and sol­i­dar­ity that the EU rep­re­sents,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of Brexit, we can now only do this as an in­de­pen­dent mem­ber state in our own right.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t want to leave and we hope to join you again soon as an equal part­ner,” she added.</p>
    <p>Re­cent opin­ion polls have shown con­sis­tent sup­port for in­de­pen­dence, with the coro­n­avirus out­break fur­ther driv­ing a wedge be­tween the de­volved govern­ment and Lon­don.</p>
    <p>But read­mis­sion to the EU would not be a for­mal­ity, with Scot­land run­ning a heavy an­nual fis­cal deficit.</p>
    <p>Ms Stur­geon would also have to rely on Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son agree­ing to a ref­er­en­dum in the first place.</p>
    <p>He has ruled out such a vote but the SNP will likely claim a man­date and heap pres­sure on him should the party per­form well in up­com­ing lo­cal elec­tions.</p>
    <p>De­spite call­ing it a once in a gen­er­a­tion vote in 2014, Ms Stur­geon ar­gues that the Brexit vote and Bri­tain’s full de­par­ture from the bloc’s sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union have changed the game.</p>
    <p>“We are now faced with a hard Brexit against our will, at the worst pos­si­ble time in the mid­dle of a pan­demic and eco­nomic re­ces­sion,” she said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“For too long, suc­ces­sive UK gov­ern­ments have taken Scot­land in the wrong di­rec­tion, cul­mi­nat­ing in Brexit. It’s no won­der so many peo­ple i n Scot­land have had enough,” she added.</p>
    <p>In Ed­in­burgh, Scot­land’s cap­i­tal, res­i­dent Zoe Ste­wart said she has never felt so out of touch with the rest of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s re­ally sad that we’re leav­ing. I don’t want to leave the EU,” Ms Ste­wart, who was one of the 62 per cent of Scots who voted against Brexit, said.</p>
    <p>“I think we should go for it, in­de­pen­dence,” she said, rais­ing a fist and smil­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a poll con­ducted by Sa­vanta ComRes for The Scots­man news­pa­per in the mid­dle of last month, 58 per cent of Scots now sup­port a break with the UK – an all-time high.</p>
    <p>“It is very dif­fi­cult to de­tect a trend. It fluc­tu­ates. The first part of 2020 was roughly 50/50,” said pro­fes­sor of ter­ri­to­rial politics Ni­cola McEwen at the Univer­sity of Ed­in­burgh.</p>
    <p>The se­cond half of the year showed a ma­jor­ity of up to 59 per cent back­ing in­de­pen­dence, “mainly on the back­drop of Covid-19”, she added.</p>
    <p>More and more peo­ple in Scot­land be­lieve our as­pi­ra­tions can best be met by con­tin­u­ing to con­trib­ute to the shared en­deav­our and sol­i­dar­ity that the EU rep­re­sents... We didn’t want to leave and we hope to join you again soon as an equal part­ner.</p>
