    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong will halt in-per­son classes at kinder­gartens, pri­mary and sec­ondary schools from Wednesday un­til the start of the schools’ Christ­mas break, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion in­cludes spe­cial needs schools and schools of­fer­ing non-lo­cal cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong re­ported 115 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, 62 of them linked to a clus­ter in­volv­ing dance stu­dios. There were 24 in­fec­tions of un­known ori­gin and six were im­ported.</p>
    <p>The lat­est fig­ure of 115 is the city’s high­est in nearly four months, as the au­thor­i­ties bat­tle a new wave of the virus. The num­ber was up from Satur­day’s 84 and was the high­est since Aug 1, when 125 cases were re­ported. It com­pared with the July 30 record of 149.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has closed bars, night­clubs and other en­ter­tain­ment venues for the third time this year, till at least Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials warned that the resur­gence is rapidly wors­en­ing.</p>
    <p>The lat­est jump in cases forced a de­lay in the launch of a travel bub­ble be­tween Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are also re­open­ing a tem­po­rary Covid-19 treat­ment hall near the city’s air­port.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, Hong Kong’s two big­gest teach­ers’ unions made sep­a­rate ap­peals to the gov­ern­ment to sus­pend all phys­i­cal classes at pri­mary and sec­ondary schools, pub­lic broad­caster RTHK re­ported.</p>
    <p>In-per­son classes at all kinder­gartens and lower pri­mary school lev­els had been sus­pended ear­lier fol­low­ing an out­break of up­per res­pi­ra­tory tract in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Dr Law Chi-kwong, Sec­re­tary for Labour and Wel­fare, said Hong Kong would re­quire staff of res­i­den­tial care homes to un­dergo manda­tory Covid-19 tests.</p>
    <p>He said those who do not com­ply would face fines and could be barred from work­ing.</p>
