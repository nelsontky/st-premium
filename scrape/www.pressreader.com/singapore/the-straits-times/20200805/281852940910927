    <p>Any le­gal chal­lenge against the move to de­lay the polls to elect a new Par­lia­ment in the city would likely be un­suc­cess­ful, and last­ing changes to the elec­toral process are to be ex­pected, po­lit­i­cal ob­servers said.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Al­bert Chen Hung Yee, a mem­ber of the Ba­sic Law Com­mit­tee that falls un­der China’s top law-making body, the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress Stand­ing Com­mit­tee (NPCSC), told The Straits Times that while it is pos­si­ble that some may chal­lenge in Hong Kong courts the emer­gency law used by Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam to de­lay the polls, the like­li­hood of a suc­cess­ful chal­lenge is quite low.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Mrs Lam an­nounced her de­ci­sion to in­voke the pow­ers un­der colo­nial-era laws – the Emer­gency Reg­u­la­tions Or­di­nance – to post­pone the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) elec­tion from Sept 6 this year to Sept 5 next year, cit­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This was the same or­di­nance that the gov­ern­ment in­voked last Oc­to­ber to ban the wear­ing of masks at le­gal and il­le­gal as­sem­blies, fol­low­ing dif­fi­culty in iden­ti­fy­ing in­di­vid­u­als dur­ing months of of­ten-vi­o­lent protests last year.</p>
    <p>In April, the Court of Ap­peal ruled that the ban on the wear­ing of masks at un­law­ful as­sem­blies is con­sti­tu­tional, over­turn­ing a lower court’s de­ci­sion. An ap­peal against this de­ci­sion has been made.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the anti-mask law, Prof Chen said: “It is un­likely that the courts will over­turn the emer­gency law to post­pone the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Now, as far as the NPCSC de­ci­sion is con­cerned, again, I don’t think the courts will re­veal whether the NPCSC de­ci­sion is valid or not.”</p>
    <p>It is a rea­son­able ar­range­ment... they (ex­ist­ing Legco mem­bers) will still have some le­git­i­macy since they were elected four years ago.</p>
    <p>aIn­stead of abid­ing by the ex­press pro­vi­sion of the Ba­sic Law, the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment is ef­fec­tively invit­ing the cen­tral gov­ern­ment to over­ride the rel­e­vant pro­vi­sions of the Ba­sic Law and Hong Kong leg­is­la­tion to cir­cum­vent pos­si­ble le­gal chal­lenges. This is con­trary to the prin­ci­ples of le­gal­ity and le­gal cer­tainty and degrades the rule of law in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam’s de­ci­sion, which she de­scribed as “the tough­est” she has had to make in seven months, has drawn flak.</p>
    <p>The Bar As­so­ci­a­tion on Sun­day said the move to seek a de­ci­sion from the NPCSC is alarm­ing as the is­sue at hand re­lates to the Ba­sic Law, or the city’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of abid­ing by the ex­press pro­vi­sion of the Ba­sic Law, the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment is ef­fec­tively invit­ing the cen­tral gov­ern­ment to over­ride the rel­e­vant pro­vi­sions of the Ba­sic Law and Hong Kong leg­is­la­tion to cir­cum­vent pos­si­ble le­gal chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“This is con­trary to the prin­ci­ples of le­gal­ity and le­gal cer­tainty and degrades the rule of law in Hong Kong,” the Bar As­so­ci­a­tion said.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, the Law So­ci­ety said it is re­view­ing the mat­ter and can­not com­ment for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>Asked about the le­git­i­macy of the de­ci­sion, Prof Chen said “it is a rea­son­able ar­range­ment” and that if ex­ist­ing Legco mem­bers con­tinue in of­fice dur­ing this one year, “they will still have some le­git­i­macy since they were elected four years ago”.</p>
    <p>With Mrs Lam in­vok­ing emer­gency pow­ers, it is now up to the NPCSC to is­sue ei­ther a de­ci­sion or an in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the Ba­sic Law to con­firm that the elec­tion can be post­poned, he said.</p>
    <p>China’s top law-making body is sched­uled to meet from Satur­day and it is widely ex­pected to weigh in on the con­tro­ver­sial mat­ter that has drawn crit­i­cism from the United States.</p>
    <p>Given that hard­lin­ers have dom­i­nated the di­rec­tion of the main­land’s pol­icy to­wards Hong Kong, a lot of changes can be ex­pected dur­ing the one-year pe­riod, pointed out As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“They will def­i­nitely not al­low dis­qual­i­fied law­mak­ers to go back to the Legco,” he said, re­fer­ring to four cur­rent op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers – Mr Alvin Ye­ung, Mr Den­nis Kwok and Mr Kwok Ka Ki of the Civic Party, as well as Mr Ken­neth Le­ung – who were re­cently banned from run­ning in the 2020 Legco elec­tion.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Tam Yiu Chung – the city’s only rep­re­sen­ta­tive on the NPCSC – said dur­ing a lo­cal ra­dio pro­gramme that it is con­tra­dic­tory to al­low the four to keep their seats if they were barred by elec­tion of­fi­cials from stand­ing in the Sept 6 polls.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing might also change the in­sti­tu­tional ar­range­ment, for ex­am­ple, fil­i­bus­ter­ing, so as to “ful­fil some goals that they’ve pur­sued in the past”, Prof Wu said.</p>
    <p>In April this year, the Cabi­netlevel Hong Kong and Ma­cau Af­fairs Of­fice blamed fil­i­bus­ter­ing by pan-demo­crat law­mak­ers for the Legco House Com­mit­tee’s fail­ure to elect a chair­man since Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>In mid-July, the Legco’s Fi­nance Com­mit­tee wrapped up its last ses­sion with­out ap­prov­ing a fund­ing re­quest to con­duct stud­ies linked to the mas­sive land recla­ma­tion ex­er­cise for hous­ing – Lan­tau To­mor­row Vi­sion – that would cre­ate a new me­trop­o­lis on ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands off Lan­tau.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with broadcaste­r TVB that was aired on Satur­day, Mrs Lam ex­pressed hope that the in­fight­ing in the Legco would end in the com­ing year so that the gov­ern­ment could con­tinue its work.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the op­po­si­tion camp’s strat­egy to seize more than half of the Legco in the 2020 polls so as to in­dis­crim­i­nately block all poli­cies, she said the “po­si­tion of com­plete re­sis­tance” only harms the public.</p>
    <p>REA­SON­ABLE MOVE</p>

He said that with Mrs Car­rie Lam in­vok­ing emer­gency pow­ers, it is now up to the NPCSC to is­sue ei­ther a de­ci­sion or an in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the Ba­sic Law to con­firm that the elec­tion can be post­poned.</p>
