    <p>YAS MA­RINA • For­mula One world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton said he hopes to re­turn for the sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix af­ter one of the hard­est weeks of his life fol­low­ing his Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Mercedes driver, who se­cured his record-equalling sev­enth ti­tle in Turkey last month, missed last Sun­day’s Sakhir Grand Prix af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive in Bahrain.</p>
    <p>“I know I’ve not been in touch this past week but it has been one of the hard­est weeks I’ve had for some time,” the 35-year-old Bri­ton said in a video on so­cial me­dia on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“I’ve just been fo­cus­ing on re­cov­er­ing and try­ing to get back in shape so I can get back in the car and race in Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>“I woke up to­day feel­ing great and got my first work­out in so I just wanted to send you guys a mes­sage of pos­i­tiv­ity, let you know I’m OK. I hope that I can get back in the car soon.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton did not say whether he had tested neg­a­tive yet, which will be a re­quire­ment for travel to Abu Dhabi for Sun­day’s race.</p>
    <p>For­mula One teams and as­so­ci­ated per­son­nel were al­lowed to en­ter Abu Dhabi on Mon­day on spe­cific flights from Bahrain, with staff then con­fined to cir­cuit ho­tels within a pro­tec­tive bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton would be able to fly to the emi­rate on a pri­vate jet but would still need ap­proval.</p>
    <p>In the seven-time cham­pion’s ab­sence, stand-in Ge­orge Rus­sell sparkled in Bahrain but was de­nied a maiden win due to a pit-stop mixup and late punc­ture. The Bri­ton fin­ished ninth.</p>
    <p>Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said Rus­sell, who nor­mally drives for Wil­liams, would stand in again if Hamil­ton is un­avail­able.</p>
    <p>But he is pos­i­tive Hamil­ton is “on the right track”, adding: “If the doc­tors’ prog­no­sis is cor­rect, he could man­age to de­liver a neg­a­tive test on Thurs­day or Fri­day.”</p>
    <p>Prac­tice starts to­mor­row and Hamil­ton, who has won 11 of the 16 races in a sea­son cut short by the pan­demic, will need to be cleared by Satur­day’s qual­i­fy­ing if he is to race.</p>
