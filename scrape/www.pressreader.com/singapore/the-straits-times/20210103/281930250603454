    <p>LON­DON Mem­bers of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Pe­tro­leum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries (Opec) and their part­ners will hold a video con­fer­ence to­mor­row to de­cide on pro­duc­tion lev­els for next month, hop­ing to turn the cor­ner on a dif­fi­cult year.</p>
    <p>The Opec+ min­is­te­rial meet­ing comes af­ter oil con­sump­tion tanked last year due to the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic and a price war be­tween Saudi Ara­bia and Rus­sia. De­spite a pick up in prices to­wards the end of the year, the mar­ket lev­els for oil re­main un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Af­ter their last sum­mit, from Nov 30 to Dec 3, the Opec+ mem­bers agreed to in­crease pro­duc­tion by half a mil­lion bar­rels per day this month. At the meet­ing, the 13 mem­bers of the Opec car­tel, led by Saudi Ara­bia, and their six al­lies, led by Rus­sia, also agreed to meet at the be­gin­ning of each month in or­der to de­cide on any ad­just­ments to pro­duc­tion vol­umes for the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia and Saudi Ara­bia are, re­spec­tively, the se­cond and third big­gest oil pro­duc­ers in the world af­ter the United States.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion il­lus­trates Opec’s de­sire to main­tain a strong in­flu­ence on the oil mar­ket, and the grav­ity of the sit­u­a­tion for crude pro­duc­ers last year.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, Opec mem­bers were con­tent with two sum­mits per year at the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s head­quar­ters in Vi­enna.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nally, we saw a strong demon­stra­tion of the will and ca­pa­bil­ity of Opec+ to man­age the mar­ket, lay­ing the ground­work for Brent’s recovery to over US$50 per bar­rel de­spite re­main­ing de­mand un­cer­tainty in the mar­ket,” JBC En­ergy an­a­lysts said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The two con­tracts of ref­er­ence, North Sea Brent Crude and West</p>
    <p>Texas In­ter­me­di­ate (WTI) crude, both ended the week around the US$50 per bar­rel level, far lower than the prices seen at the start of last year but well up on the lows seen in the year.</p>
    <p>In March, Moscow and Riyadh em­barked on a brief but in­tense price war which led oil prices to plum­met. On April 20, WTI crude col­lapsed to mi­nus US$40.32 – mean­ing pro­duc­ers paid buy­ers to take the oil off their hands.</p>
    <p>The climate be­tween the two oil gi­ants has eased since then, with the Rus­sian and Saudi en­ergy min­is­ters meet­ing in the mid­dle of last month in a dis­play of unity.</p>
    <p>It re­mains dif­fi­cult, how­ever, to pre­dict the evo­lu­tion in de­mand as gov­ern­ments be­gin rolling out vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Last month, Opec pre­dicted a slight re­bound in the mar­ket while not­ing that un­cer­tain­ties re­mained, par­tic­u­larly in the trans­port sec­tor.</p>
    <p>De­spite the heft of the Opec+ coun­tries, those out­side the sys­tem have a ma­jor im­pact on the oil mar­ket; prin­ci­pally the US, which is still pro­duc­ing 11 mil­lion bar­rels of crude per day.</p>
    <p>Even within its ranks, Opec will have to pay at­ten­tion to de­vel­op­ments in the three mem­bers which have been granted ex­emp­tions from quo­tas – Libya, Iran and Venezuela. Libya’s pro­duc­tion was al­most wiped out by civil con­flict but has spiked since Oc­to­ber af­ter the sign­ing of a ceasefire deal.</p>
