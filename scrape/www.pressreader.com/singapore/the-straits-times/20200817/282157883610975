    <p>As of early this month, close to 6,600 no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief had been filed on­line by par­ties un­able to ful­fil their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions be­cause of the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This was up from the 3,943 elec­tronic no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief served in the first five weeks since the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act came into ef­fect, as re­ported in Par­lia­ment in early June.</p>
    <p>How­ever, of those, only some 1,000 needed to be set­tled by a state-ap­pointed as­ses­sor – with over 220 de­ter­mi­na­tions is­sued – which meant that the vast ma­jor­ity were able to come to some com­pro­mise about un­ful­filled obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The Law Min­istry said: “We are heart­ened to see that of the no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief filed the ma­jor­ity did not re­quire an as­ses­sor to make a de­ter­mi­na­tion. Some par­ties orig­i­nally ap­plied for but later with­drew their ap­pli­ca­tion for an as­ses­sor’s de­ter­mi­na­tion, as they were able to ne­go­ti­ate and reach a com­pro­mise by them­selves.”</p>
    <p>The no­ti­fi­ca­tion process was spawned by the Act, which was passed in April and amended in June. The Act pro­vides a range of re­liefs for par­ties in cer­tain con­tracts, for a pre­scribed pe­riod un­til Oct 19.</p>
    <p>The re­liefs in­clude pro­tec­tion from le­gal and en­force­ment ac­tion, such as court and insolvency pro­ceed­ings, en­force­ment of se­cu­rity over spec­i­fied prop­erty and as­sets, re­pos­ses­sion of goods un­der a hire­pur­chase or rental agree­ment, and ter­mi­na­tion of lease or li­cence of non-res­i­den­tial prop­erty for non­pay­ment of rent, among other things.</p>
    <p>If par­ties are un­able to reach an agree­ment on their own even after a re­lief no­ti­fi­ca­tion is served, they may ap­ply for an as­ses­sor’s de­ter­mi­na­tion for an out­come that is just and eq­ui­table in the cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing an up­date on the im­pact of the Act, a MinLaw spokesman said par­ties ben­e­fit from the breath­ing space af­forded by the Act and will be bet­ter pre­pared to re­cover from the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Fil­ing for re­lief un­der the Act is a sig­nal that a party is fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties meet­ing its con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions. Par­ties should take these mea­sures in good faith and ex­plore com­pro­mises out­side the Act where pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>MinLaw also ac­knowl­edged that con­struc­tion work stop­page has had rip­ple ef­fects on par­ties that may not be a di­rect party to a con­struc­tion or sup­ply con­tract.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a new ten­ant who was sup­posed to use a three-month rent-free pe­riod from Fe­bru­ary to May to ren­o­vate his premises was un­able to do so, as the ren­o­va­tion com­pany could not op­er­ate dur­ing that pe­riod due to man­power re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>As the ren­o­va­tion could take place only in June and last month, this meant that the ten­ant could not gen­er­ate any rev­enue for those two months but still had to pay rent.</p>
    <p>“In the case of the ten­ant who had lost his rent-free pe­riod, the as­ses­sor may con­sider vary­ing the orig­i­nal con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions be­tween the land­lord and ten­ant, such that the ten­ant is ef­fec­tively able to re­cover some of the ben­e­fit of the orig­i­nal rent-free pe­riod that was lost,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>MinLaw is fi­nal­is­ing the scope of this re­lief, the types of con­tracts to be cov­ered and as­ses­sors’ pow­ers in such sit­u­a­tions, and will re­lease de­tails at a later date.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is still evolv­ing and the Govern­ment is mon­i­tor­ing closely. We are con­sid­er­ing fur­ther tem­po­rary mea­sures, to as­sist mi­cro and small com­pa­nies which, as a re­sult of Covid-19, may re­quire sup­port to ei­ther re­struc­ture their debts or wind down their busi­nesses,” said the spokesman.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Peo&#xAD;ple in the Cen&#xAD;tral Busi&#xAD;ness District last month. As of early this month, nearly 6,600 no&#xAD;ti&#xAD;fi&#xAD;ca&#xAD;tions for re&#xAD;lief had been filed on&#xAD;line by par&#xAD;ties un&#xAD;able to ful&#xAD;fil their con&#xAD;trac&#xAD;tual obli&#xAD;ga&#xAD;tions be&#xAD;cause of the im&#xAD;pact of the Covid-19 out&#xAD;break.
