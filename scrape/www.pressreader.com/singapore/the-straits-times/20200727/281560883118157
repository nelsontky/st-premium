    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s re­cent call for an al­liance of democ­ra­cies against China suf­fers from many prob­lems, in­clud­ing fun­da­men­tal ques­tions about mem­ber­ship of the club, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (below).</p>
    <p>In his lat­est broad­side against China, United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has called for the cre­ation of a “new al­liance of democ­ra­cies” to fight what he claimed are Bei­jing’s ma­lign ac­tiv­i­ties around the world.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it’s time for a new group­ing of like-minded na­tions, a new al­liance of democ­ra­cies,” he said. “If the free world does not change, com­mu­nist China will surely change us. We can’t re­turn to the past prac­tices be­cause they’re com­fort­able or be­cause they’re con­ve­nient,” he told an au­di­ence of se­nior diplo­mats and politi­cians just be­fore the week­end.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo chose the lo­ca­tion for his speech with great care: He de­liv­ered his re­marks out­side the Cal­i­for­nian an­ces­tral home of pres­i­dent Richard Nixon, the leader who, half a cen­tury ago, launched Amer­ica’s his­toric open­ing to China, thereby help­ing to cre­ate the world we in­habit to­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s in­tent was un­mis­tak­able: to sig­nal that Mr Nixon’s form of en­gage­ment with China is now largely over, and that a new phase, dom­i­nated by con­fronta­tion, is about to be­gin.</p>
    <p>Yet de­spite the care­ful chore­og­ra­phy and ef­forts by the US State Depart­ment to pro­mote the speech for weeks in ad­vance as a ma­jor de­par­ture in Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy, much of what Mr Pom­peo had to say was cu­ri­ously low-key and not par­tic­u­larly pro­found. The ar­gu­ment that the US is en­gaged in a com­pe­ti­tion with China which in­volves both ide­ol­ogy and other, more tra­di­tional, in­stru­ments of power has been heard be­fore.</p>
    <p>Still, the sug­ges­tion that the US should en­cour­age the cre­ation of a new al­liance of democ­ra­cies was sig­nif­i­cant, not only be­cause it rep­re­sented one of the very few con­crete pro­pos­als in a speech which was oth­er­wise largely de­void of prac­ti­cal ini­tia­tives, but also be­cause Mr Pom­peo raised the “democ­racy al­liance” pro­posal dur­ing con­ver­sa­tions with Bri­tish MPs on a trip to Lon­don early last week.</p>
    <p>Nor is he alone in push­ing this con­cept, for a ver­i­ta­ble army of aca­demics – many of whom will not be seen dead in the com­pany of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion – is also ad­vo­cat­ing the es­tab­lish­ment of such a new “al­liance”.</p>
    <p>FUN­DA­MEN­TAL QUES­TIONS</p>
    <p>There are, how­ever, two fun­da­men­tal snags in this en­tire dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>First, de­spite all the cur­rent diplo­matic noise, no­body agrees on what this group of democ­ra­cies should do. Sec­ond, far from mak­ing the world a safer place, the cre­ation of such an or­gan­i­sa­tion is only likely to ac­cel­er­ate the de­cline of in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions and worsen in­ter­na­tional ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Cu­ri­ously, who should de­cide whether a coun­try is con­sid­ered a democ­racy wor­thy of in­clu­sion in this fu­ture al­liance and how ex­ten­sive this al­liance should be – the sort of ba­sic ques­tions any­one look­ing at such a pro­posal is bound to ask – are not mat­ters which seem to pre­oc­cupy any of those who cur­rently push for this idea.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians in both Wash­ing­ton and Euro­pean cap­i­tals cur­rently toy­ing with this con­cept, as well as all the aca­demics and think-tankers who write eru­dite ar­ti­cles about it, seem to as­sume that the an­swers to both ques­tions are so self-ev­i­dent that they don’t need dis­cussing.</p>
    <p>The most fre­quent “model” is that of the cre­ation of a so-called G-10, a group­ing which will in­clude the ex­ist­ing Group of Seven (G-7) as­so­ci­a­tion of most in­dus­tri­alised states – Bri­tain, Canada, France, Ger­many, Italy, Ja­pan and the United States – plus Aus­tralia, In­dia and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Why this should be the se­lec­tion cri­te­rion is not ex­plained. Nor is any­one both­er­ing to in­quire whether some of the coun­tries which are be­ing cited as po­ten­tial mem­bers in this new al­liance are in­ter­ested in ac­cept­ing such an idea. The dis­cus­sion on the topic is con­ducted as though the coun­tries con­cerned are all will­ing and ready, and all that is needed is for some­one to pluck up the courage by mak­ing the first move.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that the dis­cus­sion is so su­per­fi­cial be­cause there is no con­sen­sus on what the pur­pose of such an al­liance is, so its pro­po­nents re­main con­tent to ig­nore thorny ques­tions about its struc­ture.</p>
    <p>AR­GU­MENTS FOR A NEW AL­LIANCE</p>
    <p>For politi­cians such as Mr Pom­peo, the pur­pose of cre­at­ing an “al­liance of democ­ra­cies” is straight­for­ward: It would be there to aug­ment the United States’ lever­age over China, pre­vent China from play­ing di­vide-and-rule games against the West in gen­eral, as well as to man­age trade with Bei­jing on the ba­sis of car­rot-and-stick ap­proaches. That means that the newly cre­ated al­liance has got to be small enough to be co­her­ent, but ex­ten­sive enough to be pow­er­ful by in­clud­ing the most sig­nif­i­cant Western economies.</p>
    <p>For Euro­pean politi­cians who sup­port the idea of the so-called G-10, the ob­jec­tive of cre­at­ing such an en­tity is, how­ever, quite dif­fer­ent: to re­state and strengthen their re­la­tion­ship with the US.</p>
    <p>Th­ese Euro­peans ar­gue that the US can­not be ex­pected to con­tinue de­fend­ing Europe if the Euro­peans, in turn, are not pre­pared to con­trib­ute to the man­age­ment of the se­cu­rity ques­tion which pre­oc­cu­pies the US most, namely China. The cre­ation of a G-10 could ad­dress this prob­lem in the way that Nato – the US-led mil­i­tary al­liance in Europe – can­not since Nato’s own treaty ex­plic­itly con­fines its ar­eas of op­er­a­tions to Europe and North Amer­ica alone. So, cre­at­ing a new struc­ture meets this new need.</p>
    <p>It is also no ac­ci­dent that many Euro­pean ad­her­ents to the G-10 idea are to be found in Bri­tain, a coun­try which has just left the Euro­pean Union and is in search of a pur­pose.</p>
    <p>“Bri­tain’s role as a bridge be­tween the democ­ra­cies is far from over,” write lo­cal an­a­lysts Erik Brat­tberg and Ben Ju­dah; by en­gag­ing the other G-7 mem­bers on the G-10 idea, the Bri­tish will help usher “a grand strat­egy for the democ­ra­cies that will work to keep China in check, In­dia close, and the United States steady in the tur­bu­lent years to come”.</p>
    <p>And then, there are se­nior aca­demics such as in­ter­na­tional af­fairs pro­fes­sor John Iken­berry at Prince­ton Univer­sity, who sup­port the cre­ation of a G-10 not nec­es­sar­ily as a bul­wark against China, but as a mech­a­nism for res­cu­ing the in­ter­na­tional lib­eral or­der of to­day from to­tal dis­in­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in the cur­rent is­sue of For­eign Af­fairs mag­a­zine – the hand­book of the US for­eign pol­icy es­tab­lish­ment – he sug­gests that “the United States could work with its G-7 part­ners to ex­pand that group’s ac­tiv­i­ties and mem­ber­ship, adding coun­tries such as Aus­tralia and South Korea”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Pro­fes­sor Iken­berry, the new body could be­come “a sort of steer­ing com­mit­tee of the world’s 10 lead­ing democ­ra­cies that would guide the re­turn to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and re­build a global or­der that pro­tects lib­eral prin­ci­ples. The lead­ers of this new group could be­gin by forg­ing a set of com­mon rules and norms for a re­struc­tured trad­ing sys­tem. They could also es­tab­lish an agenda for re­launch­ing global co­op­er­a­tion on cli­mate change and con­fer about pre­par­ing for the next vi­ral pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>In short, the G-10 may fix all the world’s cur­rent prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Only that it will not.</p>
    <p>DI­VI­SION AND DIF­FER­ENCES</p>
    <p>First, it is rather cu­ri­ous that none other than the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, which has done so much to ridicule and dis­miss the role and im­por­tance of in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions, should now be ad­vo­cat­ing the cre­ation of a new co­op­er­a­tive struc­ture in which – if this is to work – the US would have to com­pro­mise with other na­tions, pre­cisely what Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump finds most ob­jec­tion­able.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, there is ab­so­lutely no ap­petite in ei­ther Ger­many or France to sup­port such an in­sti­tu­tion. The Ger­mans have prob­lems shoul­der­ing their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties for Europe’s de­fences, let alone take on global se­cu­rity re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of the kind a G-10 mem­ber­ship would en­tail. And the French have an au­to­matic aver­sion to any­thing pro­posed or led by the US; run­ning Europe in equidis­tance to the US is what the French like.</p>
    <p>What’s more, none of the coun­tries which may be in­volved in such an en­ter­prise agrees on what needs to be done about China.</p>
    <p>All see China as a grow­ing se­cu­rity chal­lenge. But some – such as South Korea – need Chi­nese be­nign co­op­er­a­tion for their im­me­di­ate na­tional se­cu­rity, while oth­ers – such as the Euro­peans – can af­ford to take a more relaxed view of se­cu­rity ques­tions, but are much more in­ter­ested in mat­ters of trade and trans­fer of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>And then, there are other fun­da­men­tal his­toric dis­par­i­ties. South Korea and Ja­pan co­op­er­at­ing on China? Yes, on a con­fi­den­tial ba­sis over mat­ters such as in­tel­li­gence in­for­ma­tion, but not in public, and not over broader for­eign pol­icy ques­tions. Would In­dia swal­low its pride and decades of for­eign pol­icy in­de­pen­dence in re­turn for mem­ber­ship in such a group?</p>
    <p>More sig­nif­i­cantly, what hap­pens to coun­tries not in­cluded in the G-10 is as im­por­tant as what hap­pens to those who are part of this pu­ta­tive or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Would medium-sized Euro­pean coun­tries be happy to go along with what the larger Euro­peans are sug­gest­ing? Would Asean be happy to take ad­vice – not to speak of in­struc­tions – from an or­gan­i­sa­tion which, in­evitably, will come to be re­garded as a “direc­torate of the world”?</p>
    <p>Far from strength­en­ing the in­ter­na­tional fab­ric of co­op­er­a­tion as Prof Iken­berry hopes, the cre­ation of a G-10 is far more likely to help in its break­down.</p>
    <p>LIKELY CHI­NESE RE­AC­TION</p>
    <p>And far from putting re­la­tions with China on a more pre­dictable foot­ing, the emer­gence of an “al­liance of democ­ra­cies” will per­suade lead­ers in Bei­jing that they are fac­ing a pro­longed chal­lenge of con­tain­ment, and in­vite more, rather than less, con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>In short, far from be­ing an idea whose time has come, the “al­liance of democ­ra­cies” is an idea whose time may never ar­rive, at least not in any shape cur­rently be­ing de­bated.</p>
    <p>So, given all th­ese con­sid­er­a­tions, why should we waste any time even talk­ing about it?</p>
    <p>Be­cause as flawed as it may be, the con­cept of an al­liance of democ­ra­cies will live on and will re­main with us for many years to come, as a vague as­pi­ra­tion, a sup­posed an­swer to the world’s most press­ing prob­lems, a sort of for­eign pol­icy equiv­a­lent to the race for the vac­cine to the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>If Pres­i­dent Trump sur­prises all opin­ion poll­sters and wins a sec­ond term in of­fice in</p>
    <p>Novem­ber, one can be sure that the G-10 con­cept will re­turn with a vengeance.</p>
    <p>But if Mr Joe Bi­den clinches the pres­i­dency, he too will be search­ing for a new global struc­ture to con­nect be­tween like-minded na­tions, to deal with China.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, the chances of cre­at­ing a G-10 re­main tiny. Much smaller – hope­fully – than the chances of producing a coronaviru­s vac­cine.</p>
