    <p>Four Bangladesh navy ships took the sec­ond and big­ger group of Ro­hingya Mus­lims yet from crowded refugee camps to an is­land three hours from the main­land. The gov­ern­ment in­sisted that the 1,800 refugees want to start new lives on Bhashan Char, where oth­ers ar­rived ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>BHASHAN CHAR • Four navy ships from Bangladesh yes­ter­day trans­ported the sec­ond and big­ger group of Ro­hingya Mus­lims from crowded refugee camps to an un­cer­tain fu­ture on a bleak is­land three hours from the main­land.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in­sisted that the 1,800 refugees, who have been in camps since flee­ing a Myan­mar mil­i­tary crack­down, want to start new lives on</p>
    <p>Bhashan Char, where 1,600 oth­ers ar­rived ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>But rights ac­tivists ex­pressed new doubts about the trans­fers. They said some Ro­hingya had their shanty homes in the camps</p>
    <p>on the Myan­mar bor­der pad­locked, so they had no choice.</p>
    <p>The Bangladesh gov­ern­ment wants to even­tu­ally re­house 100,000 of the camps’ ap­prox­i­mately one mil­lion Ro­hingya on the is­land, which takes the full force of cy­clones that roar across the Bay of Ben­gal each year.</p>
    <p>The Ro­hingya car­ried bags of be­long­ings, toys and chick­ens and took self­ies with each other as they sat on wooden benches dur­ing the three-hour trip from Chit­tagong to Bhashan Char.</p>
    <p>Hous­ing blocks have been set up for the new ar­rivals on the is­land which For­eign Min­is­ter A.K. Ab­dul Momen has called a “beau­ti­ful re­sort”.</p>
    <p>More than 700,000 Ro­hingya joined 300,000 al­ready in camps in Bangladesh in 2017 after a deadly purge of their vil­lages in Myan­mar that the United Na­tions has said could be geno­cide.</p>
    <p>With Bangladesh now strug­gling to find a long-term so­lu­tion to the Ro­hingya ex­o­dus, gov­ern­ment refugee of­fi­cials said there were better liv­ing fa­cil­i­ties and better se­cu­rity for the Ro­hingya in Bhashan Char.</p>
    <p>“They are very ea­ger to go to Bhashan Char be­cause they have heard from their rel­a­tives, those who have gone to Bhashan Char, that it is an ex­cel­lent place,” said Dr Momen.</p>
    <p>Some Ro­hingya in this sec­ond group said they were go­ing will­ingly. “The camp is a dif­fi­cult and over­crowded place to live in and move around,” said Mr Shafi Alam on the navy ship.</p>
    <p>Madam Mo­rium Khatun, 55, said she was mak­ing the change to es­cape drug-re­lated crime in the camps, with dozens killed in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>“I am look­ing for peace of mind. The refugee camp is not a place for that,” said the grand­mother.</p>
    <p>But an in­ter­na­tional rights worker who in­ter­viewed some Ro­hingya said they had no choice about the move. “The homes of some of the refugees were pad­locked by vol­un­teers work­ing for the Bangladesh camp author­i­ties to force them to agree to the re­lo­ca­tion,” the worker said.</p>
    <p>After the first trans­fer on Dec 4, sev­eral Ro­hingya said that they were beaten and in­tim­i­dated to agree to move. The UN said it has not been in­volved in the process.</p>
