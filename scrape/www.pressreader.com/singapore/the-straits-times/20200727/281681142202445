    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The Malaysian govern­ment will reim­pose its coun­try­wide lock­down should the num­ber of new Covid-19 cases climb to more than 100 a day, the min­is­ter in charge of man­ag­ing the coronaviru­s out­break said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The South-east Asian coun­try is now under what it calls the re­cov­ery move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO), with most busi­nesses al­lowed to op­er­ate if they fol­low health mea­sures such as record­ing the tem­per­a­tures of those en­ter­ing malls, of­fices and shops, and record­ing the vis­its with con­tact trac­ing apps.</p>
    <p>But daily new cases have been spik­ing again in the past week.</p>
    <p>“If it reaches three dig­its, we have no choice but to rein­tro­duce the MCO and we will see,” Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob told re­porters i n the Ke­lan­tan cap­i­tal Kota Baru, as quoted by Ber­nama news agency.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­ported 13 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, com­pared with 23 last Satur­day, 21 last Fri­day and nine last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry had an­nounced just over three weeks ago, on July 1, that the coun­try had recorded zero cases of lo­cal trans­mis­sion for the first time since March, and had only one new case that was im­ported.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand that if the MCO is en­forced again, it will make things dif­fi­cult for all par­ties, in­clud­ing those of us who want to work and so on but this mea­sure must be taken,” Datuk Seri Is­mail said, as quoted by the na­tional news agency.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to com­piled data on Malaysi­akini, Malaysia last re­ported more than 100 cases a day on June 4, when 277 cases were re­ported.</p>
    <p>The cu­mu­la­tive tally of in­fec­tions in the coun­try stands at 8,884. There were no new fa­tal­i­ties, with the death toll re­main­ing at 123.</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail said one main rea­son for the resur­gence of cases is the public’s com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>“This is be­cause the public has for­got­ten what needs to be done when we eased the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures... the num­ber of cases be­gins to rise again,” he said, as quoted by Ber­nama.</p>
    <p>Malaysia im­ple­mented the MCO on March 18, lock­ing down much of the coun­try for more than three months as it tried to re­duce the num­ber of new daily cases, es­pe­cially af</p>
