    <p>Hol­ly­wood thrives on loud, colour­ful con­fronta­tions in films such as last year’s Avengers: Endgame and the forth­com­ing Godzilla Vs Kong. So di­rec­tors and ac­tors have not held back since Warn­erMe­dia de­clared that it would sus­pend nearly a cen­tury of tra­di­tion in the face of pan­demic dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Warner is to re­lease all of its 17 new films next year on its stream­ing ser­vice HBO Max at the same time as in United States cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>Cue ou­trage, with di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan fir­ing back last week that the stars “went to bed the night be­fore think­ing they were work­ing for the greatest movie stu­dio and woke up to find out they were work­ing for the worst stream­ing ser­vice”.</p>
    <p>Ouch. Nolan has a way with words, as well as with fit­ting ac­tion around baf­fling con­cep­tual plots in films such as In­cep­tion and this year’s Tenet.</p>
    <p>He might well be an­noyed: Since AT&T took over Time Warner (in­clud­ing the Warner Bros stu­dio and HBO) in 2018, it has fo­cused in­tently on boost­ing broadband and mo­bile phone sub­scrip­tions, rather than stroking the tal­ent.</p>
    <p>More than cin­e­matic pride lies be­hind the anger at films such as the sci­ence fic­tion epic Dune be­com­ing sub­scrip­tion fod­der.</p>
    <p>Stars, agents and di­rec­tors de­pend for their wealth on shar­ing in box-of­fice profits, as well as be­ing paid a fee. “Ul­ti­mately, peo­ple want to make money,” Mr John Stankey, AT&T chief ex­ec­u­tive, ob­served last week.</p>
    <p>But Nolan is surely cor­rect that his stream­ing over­lords “don’t even un­der­stand what they’re los­ing” in the ef­fort to catch</p>
    <p>Netflix and Dis­ney Plus, their more suc­cess­ful ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood’s most prof­itable films are cul­tural and fi­nan­cial block­busters that are shrunk by the small screen.</p>
    <p>It does not mean that tele­vi­sion is in­fe­rior. Last week, I watched Mank, David Fincher’s film about Her­man Mankiewicz, who wrote the screen­play of Ci­ti­zen Kane with Or­son Welles. Some of the rav­ish­ing black and white cine­matog­ra­phy would have shone in cin­e­mas where it was re­leased first, but its in­ti­macy suited tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Much drama of the kind that used to be a main­stay of cin­ema has mi­grated to tele­vi­sion, thanks to HBO and Netflix. That is where to­day’s suc­ces­sors to Mankiewicz have be­come au­teur showrun­ners of series such as The So­pra­nos and The Crown – while film di­rec­tors make ac­tion flicks, ro­man­tic come­dies and young adult epics.</p>
    <p>Since the Star Wars and Su­per­man films of the 1970s, Hol­ly­wood has gone as big as pos­si­ble to lure peo­ple from their homes to pay for the com­mu­nal ex­pe­ri­ence of watch­ing spec­tac­u­lar ac­tion, com­plete with boom­ing sound, at cin­e­mas. It has aimed at the widest au­di­ence, not the con­nois­seur.</p>
    <p>Glob­al­i­sa­tion has helped the for­mula to work: Global box of­fice rev­enues rose to US$42 bil­lion (S$56 bil­lion) last year. Teenagers are faith­ful to long-run­ning film fran­chises such as those fea­tur­ing Dis­ney’s Marvel su­per­heroes; 12- to 17-year-olds in the US and Canada went to the movies an av­er­age of 4.9 times last year, com­pared with 2.9 for peo­ple in their 50s.</p>
    <p>The cin­ema is un­der most strain in the US, where box-of­fice rev­enues fell last year, even be­fore the pan­demic (the US and Canada com­prise only about one-quar­ter of global box-of­fice re­ceipts).</p>
    <p>Nolan’s Tenet was fi­nally re­leased in Bri­tain in Au­gust in an ef­fort to get the au­di­ence back, but it strug­gled in US cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>The growth of stream­ing has al­ready made per­form­ers less snooty about tele­vi­sion. Ni­cole Kid­man and Hugh Grant, stars of the HBO show The Un­do­ing, are A-list ac­tors of the kind who would not have been seen dead on the small screen only a few years ago.</p>
    <p>It is easy to see the temp­ta­tion for Warner, fac­ing a pile-up of new re­leases amid the pan­demic and a stream­ing ser­vice in need of help, to seize the op­por­tu­nity to shake up Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney is re­leas­ing Pixar’s Soul to Dis­ney Plus’s 74 mil­lion sub­scribers on Christmas Day in the US, so Warner is not alone.</p>
    <p>But it looks a bit des­per­ate. HBO Max was a flawed idea – tak­ing a pi­o­neer­ing ser­vice with a first-rate rep­u­ta­tion in HBO and bundling it con­fus­ingly with other Warner content. Hav­ing gained only 13 mil­lion ac­tive sub­scribers, it now wants to pour new films down the same fun­nel. No won­der the tal­ent is irked.</p>
    <p>Films such as Dune and Godzilla Vs Kong, with US$150 mil­lion-plus bud­gets, are not made for tele­vi­sion. They are pro­duced to be events, with huge mar­ket­ing cam­paigns and a series of re­lease win­dows from cin­ema to stream­ing to keep the ex­cite­ment, and the rev­enue streams, bub­bling away for years. It may not be art, but it is a craft.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney is ex­pert at manag­ing its fran­chises, turn­ing car­toon princesses into dolls and ad­ven­ture films into theme park rides. Its space west­ern hit, The Mandaloria­n, on Dis­ney Plus is a spin-off from the Star Wars films. Let cin­ema at­ro­phy and the en­tire en­ter­tain­ment ed­i­fice would suf­fer.</p>
    <p>Warner in­tends to re­turn to US cin­ema-first re­leases when the pan­demic passes. But the writ­ing is on the wall: If stream­ing takes over en­tirely, the block­buster as we know it be­comes an en­dan­gered species. No doubt some­one will make a movie about it one day.</p>
