    <p>In­vest looks at the highs and lows of the Covid-19 rental mar­ket, what land­lords need to watch out for and the prospects for S’pore’s most ex­pen­sive condos for lease.</p>
    <p>The monthly rental of this su­per lux­u­ri­ous pen­t­house near Or­chard Road is enough to lease about 10 de­cent two-bed­room condos in the city area.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, at $58,000 a month, this two-storey pen­t­house in Nassim Hill holds the dis­tinc­tion of be­ing Sin­ga­pore’s most ex­pen­sive con­do­minium cur­rently avail­able for rent.</p>
    <p>Just a few months ago, a fam­ily from over­seas made an of­fer of $49,000 a month, but the own­ers – a Sin­ga­porean cou­ple who run their own busi­ness – turned it down.</p>
    <p>That the own­ers have not budged on the ask­ing price shows the re­silience of the rental mar­ket here, which con­tin­ues to hold steady in many parts of Sin­ga­pore, de­spite the se­vere out­break-in­duced down­turn.</p>
    <p>Ms Shirley Ong, vice-pres­i­dent of Mu­tual Ben­e­fits Realty who rep­re­sents the own­ers, says: “The own­ers trea­sure this home very much and so, they are will­ing to wait un­til the right fam­ily comes along.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently there are a few other lux­ury con­do­mini­ums in the city and Ma­rina Bay area that are avail­able for rent and th­ese units cost be­tween $30,000 and $40,000 a month.</p>
    <p>So, what does the ad­di­tional pre­mium get you? Pri­vacy and a gen­er­ous amount of space.</p>
    <p>At more than 7,000 sq ft, the Nassim pen­t­house is about the size of seven stan­dard three-bed­room condos in the Or­chard area.</p>
    <p>“A unique fea­ture of its de­sign is that it gives ab­so­lute pri­vacy to its oc­cu­pants,” says Ms Ong.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, both lev­els are ac­ces­si­ble by pri­vate lift from the carpark. So the oc­cu­pant of the ju­nior mas­ter bed­room on the up­per floor can ac­tu­ally come home with­out the rest of the fam­ily know­ing.”</p>
    <p>All four bed­rooms on the lower floor have their own bath­rooms.</p>
    <p>The mas­ter bed­room, which is as big as a three-bed­room apart­ment by it­self, comes with a huge walkin wardrobe and a large bath­room.</p>
    <p>As for the liv­ing room, it is ad­joined to a wide bal­cony that can fit a huge ta­ble for out­door din­ing – to­gether, the space seems big­ger than two bad­minton courts.</p>
    <p>That is not all – it has an­other din­ing area on the rooftop that comes with stoves and its own U-shape swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>Those who can af­ford to rent this home are ex­pected to spend an ad­di­tional sum on fur­ni­ture be­cause the pen­t­house is va­cant and comes only with fit­tings and fix­tures.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally at such a bud­get, the ten­ants will pre­fer to bring in their own fur­ni­ture that suits their own taste,” says Ms Ong, not­ing that the own­ers spent over $1 mil­lion in in­te­rior de­sign ear­lier to adorn the pen­t­house with branded cur­tains, wall­pa­per and car­pets.</p>
    <p>But know that it is not easy to be­come land­lords of such in­vest­ment prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Even if the own­ers do not have ex­ist­ing home loans to worry about, they have to bear sub­stan­tial “over­heads” such as condo man­age­ment fees, which can be over $30,000 a year for such units.</p>
    <p>Then there is the prop­erty tax, which can be in tens of thou­sands if not more, as well as other monthly run­ning costs, such as util­ity and pool main­te­nance costs if the unit is un­oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>But does it mean that the own­ers will make huge prof­its, if they se­cure a long-term ten­ant?</p>
    <p>Well, here are the hard num­bers: As­sum­ing a ten­ant signs a 10-year lease – this means he will pay a to­tal rent of close to $7 mil­lion for that pe­riod. Even at this sum, the rent in­come barely makes up a quar­ter of the pen­t­house’s cur­rent sell­ing price of $29 mil­lion, let alone the run­ning costs.</p>
    <p>Hence, the rule for a player in the prop­erty in­vest­ment game is that the big­ger the prop­erty, the deeper the pock­ets you must have. Tan Ooi Boon</p>
