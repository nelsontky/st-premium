    <p>As Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien</p>
    <p>Loong said in a much-quoted speech back in June, the United States and China need to find a way to work to­gether if a new Cold War is to be avoided. The trou­ble is, there doesn’t seem to be much to bind the two sides these days.</p>
    <p>The fight against Covid-19 could have pro­vided op­por­tu­nity for the su­per­pow­ers to col­lab­o­rate for the com­mon good. Re­gret­tably, the pan­demic has be­come far too politi­cised. US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ma­nip­u­la­tion of the “Wuhan flu” and what he re­peat­edly la­bels the “China virus” in sup­port of his re-elec­tion bid, and Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s drive to take ad­van­tage of the virus by ag­gres­sively push­ing China’s goals, have in­fu­ri­ated and re­pelled in equal mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Work­ing to­gether on cli­mate change would have been an­other route to ac­cord, and one that has been heav­ily pushed by the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. The US’ re­jec­tion of the Paris Agree­ment has put an end to that for now.</p>
    <p>There is though an­other area where the two coun­tries could work to­gether, and one where Sin­ga­pore could make per­haps an un­likely im­pact: the Arc­tic.</p>
    <p>China has a strong in­ter­est in the High North. In 2013, the coun­try joined Sin­ga­pore as one of the ob­servers to the eight-coun­try body that over­sees the re­gion, the Arc­tic Coun­cil, which has as its per­ma­nent mem­bers the US, Canada, Russia and the five Nordic na­tions.</p>
    <p>Then, in 2018, China an­nounced the launch of its vi­sion for a Po­lar Silk Road, where it claimed to be a “near Arc­tic na­tion”, even though Bei­jing is al­most 3,000km from the Arc­tic Cir­cle.</p>
    <p>China’s po­lar vi­sion is pri­mar­ily based on its eco­nomic am­bi­tions in the area, not least the new sea lanes be­ing opened up as the Arc­tic ice melts. Ac­cord­ing to ex­perts, these ice-free routes could re­duce the jour­ney time for ex­ports from</p>
    <p>China to Euro­pean mar­kets by up to half, and so con­trol­ling them has to be a strate­gic ob­jec­tive for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Then there are the Arc­tic’s plen­ti­ful nat­u­ral re­sources, in­clud­ing en­ergy. As part of its ef­forts to re­duce its de­pen­dency on coal, China has been in­creas­ingly turn­ing to gas for its needs, and last year, it in­au­gu­rated a 3,000km pipe­line that stretches from Russia’s Siberian gas fields to China’s north-east.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Moscow and Bei­jing have been col­lab­o­rat­ing more and more in the Arc­tic in re­cent years, to the ben­e­fit of both sides: Chi­nese cap­i­tal will be im­por­tant, if not vi­tal, in build­ing the in­fra­struc­ture that Russia needs to prop­erly de­velop both the Arc­tic sea lanes and the en­ergy re­sources that China wants to utilise.</p>
    <p>This bur­geon­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween two of Amer­ica’s lead­ing com­peti­tors is of con­cern to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, but it is not the only one. There are also sus­pi­cions about the Mid­dle King­dom’s Arc­tic sci­en­tific agenda. Its re­search fa­cil­i­ties on the Nor­we­gian is­land of Sval­bard, and those in Swe­den and in Ice­land are thought to be dual pur­pose, pro­vid­ing im­por­tant in­tel­li­gence to the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army and al­low­ing the devel­op­ment of cold-weather war­fare ca­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>There is, how­ever, an al­ter­na­tive way of look­ing at China’s Arc­tic as­pi­ra­tions. Namely, that there may be far more for Amer­ica and the West in gen­eral to gain from them than there is to lose.</p>
    <p>First and fore­most, bring­ing China into the re­gion will­ingly is a way for both sides to learn how to work with each other, some­thing that has been all too ab­sent in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The Arc­tic Coun­cil is a well-run in­ter­na­tional body that, with the sup­port of its mem­bers like Sin­ga­pore, could serve as a sta­ble plat­form for Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing to ex­plore each other’s mo­tives and cre­ate a bond of un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>This in turn would al­low diplo­matic con­nec­tions to be formed and com­mon­al­i­ties of pur­pose dis­cov­ered across the ar­eas of in­ter­est they share, such as the sus­tain­able ex­trac­tion of re­sources and the safe­guard­ing of trade routes. It would also fa­cil­i­tate the restart­ing of their co­op­er­a­tion on cli­mate change, which the Arc­tic is cen­tral to.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the re­gion could act as a test bed to de­velop naval conduct agree­ments sim­i­lar to those that ex­isted be­tween the US and the Soviet Union, and which did a great deal to stop un­planned in­ci­dents turn­ing a Cold War hot. As the 2018 near-miss be­tween US and Chi­nese war­ships in the South China Sea showed, both sides are in ur­gent need of in­ci­dent man­age­ment pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>China and Russia’s Arc­tic push has forced Amer­ica to pay more at­ten­tion to the re­gion. So far this has mainly been a mil­i­tary flavoured re­sponse, for ex­am­ple, send­ing ships to the Bar­ents Sea for the first time in 30 years, and the pub­li­ca­tion of a new air force strat­egy.</p>
    <p>But it is on the diplo­matic front where Wash­ing­ton has the most to gain, in cre­at­ing a modus vivendi with its key strate­gic com­peti­tor in a lightly in­hab­ited part of the world.</p>
    <p>The Arc­tic may be re­mote and in­hos­pitable, but it rep­re­sents per­haps the best lo­ca­tion for the two coun­tries to re­dis­cover some warmth towards each other. The in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, par­tic­u­larly na­tions that have a pres­ence on the Arc­tic Coun­cil such as Sin­ga­pore, Ja­pan and the United King­dom, should be do­ing every­thing in their power to make the su­per­pow­ers grasp this op­por­tu­nity.</p>
