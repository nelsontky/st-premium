    <p>There is a say­ing in Chi­nese, “wu yi xi wei gui”. It means that which is scarce is pre­cious.</p>
    <p>In tiny Sin­ga­pore, de­spite hav­ing no nat­u­ral re­sources, few things are ac­tu­ally scarce. And the one thing we rarely seem to run out of is food. Bustling hawker cen­tres, res­tau­rants at full house and well-stocked su­per­mar­ket shelves are con­stant re­minders that food is al­ways eas­ily within reach here.</p>
    <p>Per­haps this ap­par­ent abun­dance is why a na­tion of food lovers takes food for granted: In 2019, 744,000 tonnes of food ended up in the bin, about 33 per cent more than what we threw away as a na­tion in 2007. The moun­tain of food waste trans­lates to about 51,000 dou­ble-decker buses in weight, or two bowls of rice per per­son each day.</p>
    <p>Not know­ing the real costs of food waste is a rea­son why we fail to value food.</p>
    <p>For the av­er­age con­sumer here, food spend­ing takes up a smaller pro­por­tion of our dis­pos­able in­come than those liv­ing in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures from the United States Depart­ment for Agri­cul­ture show that the av­er­age per­son in Sin­ga­pore spent only 7 per cent of to­tal con­sumer ex­pen­di­ture on food con­sumed at home in 2016, while that fig­ure is 26 per cent in Thai­land, 31 per cent in In­done­sia and 42 per cent in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>What this means is we feel less of a pinch when throw­ing away food com­pared with our im­me­di­ate neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, a house­hold in Sin­ga­pore throws away 2.5kg of avoid­able food waste – food items that could have been con­sumed if bet­ter man­aged – ev­ery week. Taken to­gether, all house­holds across Sin­ga­pore throw away about $342 mil­lion worth of food ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>Over the past few years, there has been a lot of em­pha­sis by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) on what con­sumers can do to re­duce food wastage, such as not or­der­ing more than what they can eat when din­ing out, or be­ing open to buy­ing “ugly” food – pro­duce with su­per­fi­cial im­per­fec­tions that usu­ally end up in the trash be­cause of them.</p>
    <p>But a big piece of the food waste puzzle is still be­ing over­looked: busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>WASTE­FUL BUSI­NESSES</p>
    <p>NEA es­ti­mates that 40 per cent of the food waste gen­er­ated in Sin­ga­pore comes from the com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial sec­tors. This in­cludes ho­tels, res­tau­rants and su­per­mar­kets, as well as food man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, busi­nesses might not feel strongly about re­duc­ing food waste sim­ply be­cause they are not aware of the true costs of food waste.</p>
    <p>Ms Pra­tima Singh, se­nior man­ager for pub­lic pol­icy and thought lead­er­ship at The Econ­o­mist In­tel­li­gence Unit, said get­ting that data can be crit­i­cal in mak­ing the busi­ness case to re­duce food waste.</p>
    <p>“Un­less I know how much I’m wast­ing or how much money I’m leav­ing on the ta­ble as a re­sult, it will be dif­fi­cult for me to make any ad­just­ments,” she added.</p>
    <p>For some busi­nesses, fig­ur­ing out ways to throw out less food can be more costly than dis­card­ing it.</p>
    <p>This could be due to food prices not re­flect­ing the real costs of pro­duc­ing food, which in­clude ex­ter­nal­i­ties such as pol­lu­tion and the gen­er­a­tion of greenhouse gases in the source coun­try.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, gath­er­ing food waste data and analysing that data over time can be key to help­ing firms man­age their in­ven­tory bet­ter and carry out more ef­fec­tive de­mand plan­ning, but if the costs of in­vest­ing in such tech­nol­ogy and an­a­lyt­ics out­weigh the costs of throw­ing food out, busi­nesses are likely to opt for the lat­ter, said Ms Singh.</p>
    <p>With this lack of a strong busi­ness case to re­duce food waste, busi­nesses – which are ul­ti­mately con­cerned with their bot­tom line – can­not be re­lied on to re­duce food waste out of good­will.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the course of work­ing on a six-part food waste se­ries, which was a Sun­day Times col­lab­o­ra­tion with DBS Bank, I was sur­prised at the lack of data that I could gather about the amount of food waste gen­er­ated at each stage of the food sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, most ma­jor su­per­mar­ket chains I spoke to de­clined to re­veal how much food waste was gen­er­ated at their stores yearly. Ar­guably, their re­luc­tance to di­vulge such in­for­ma­tion could be at­trib­uted to a fear of pub­lic back­lash, or maybe a fail­ure to track and record food waste in­for­ma­tion in their op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But more dis­con­cert­ing to me was that NEA – the govern­ment agency that over­sees waste man­age­ment in Sin­ga­pore and which had spear­headed the Zero Waste Mas­ter­plan launched in 2019 – was not able to shed light on fig­ures on the over­all food waste</p>
    <p>gen­er­ated by su­per­mar­kets here.</p>
    <p>Why is the agency not keep­ing track of this closely when su­per­mar­kets are no­to­ri­ous for throw­ing out large amounts of ed­i­ble food?</p>
    <p>While the mas­ter­plan ini­tia­tive is a re­flec­tion of the Govern­ment’s ef­forts to fo­cus on sus­tain­abil­ity and en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues in re­cent years, bridg­ing that in­for­ma­tion gap and mak­ing that data trans­par­ent should be a pri­or­ity if Sin­ga­pore in­deed wants to work to­wards be­com­ing a zero-waste na­tion.</p>
    <p>If there is no aware­ness of how much food waste in­di­vid­ual stake­hold­ers in the sup­ply chain are gen­er­at­ing, how can Sin­ga­pore be­gin to even re­solve the is­sue?</p>
    <p>So far, cam­paigns un­der the mas­ter­plan have been mostly tar­geted at rais­ing aware­ness among con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Such ef­forts are com­mend­able be­cause ed­u­cat­ing the pub­lic – even on sim­ple things such as how to read la­bels and dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween “best be­fore dates” and “ex­piry dates”, and a will­ing­ness to buy less-than-per­fect pro­duce from re­duced-to-clear sec­tions at su­per­mar­kets – will go a long way in the na­tional bat­tle against food waste.</p>
    <p>Cos­metic fil­ter­ing, for in­stance, ac­counts for a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of the food that is thrown out by busi­nesses. From bruised ap­ples to veg­eta­bles with yel­lowed leaves to chick­ens that are not of the “right size”, firms point to picky con­sumers with high ex­pec­ta­tions of the some­times ridicu­lous stan­dards they ex­pect of the pro­duce they would buy.</p>
    <p>But how many of these in­dus­try stan­dards are ac­tu­ally made in close con­sul­ta­tion with cus­tomers, and how many are self-im­posed? Much of this “un­sightly” pro­duce never makes it to the shelves in stores, and con­sumers are rarely given a choice as to whether or not to buy such pro­duce.</p>
    <p>There is value in these food prod­ucts that are orig­i­nally</p>
    <p>des­tined for the bin, and lo­cal so­cial en­ter­prises Tree­dots and Ug­lyFood have proved this by tak­ing dis­carded “im­per­fect” food such as chicken parts and veg­eta­bles and made a busi­ness from sell­ing it at dis­counted prices to con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Their suc­cess­ful busi­ness mod­els show that there is value in food that would have been tossed out at ev­ery stage of the food sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>An NEA study in 2019 also showed that 32 per cent of re­spon­dents were open to buy­ing fruits and veg­eta­bles with slight im­per­fec­tions, up from 23 per cent in 2015.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times for the food waste se­ries, 45 per cent of re­spon­dents also said they buy fruits and veg­eta­bles from the re­duced-to-clear sec­tions at su­per­mar­kets oc­ca­sion­ally, fre­quently or all the time. About two-thirds of re­spon­dents who buy from the sec­tions said they do so in or­der to save money.</p>
    <p>This shows that if prices are right, cos­met­i­cally fil­tered pro­duce do have very will­ing tak­ers, but it boils down to whether re­tail­ers like su­per­mar­kets are will­ing to do more to drive sales for this “ugly” pro­duce.</p>
    <p>For a de­ci­sion laden with moral con­se­quences such as food waste, we can­not rely en­tirely on profit-driven busi­nesses to do the right thing, es­pe­cially if there is no eco­nomic in­cen­tive to do so.</p>
    <p>When busi­nesses do­nate un­sold items to the needy, for in­stance, it is more of a moral im­per­a­tive rather than a de­ci­sion that makes busi­ness sense. Redis­tribut­ing food, af­ter all, in­volves in­cur­ring ex­tra costs which un­der­mines prof­its.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, a hand­ful of char­i­ties here, like Food From The Heart, are rechan­nelling food that would oth­er­wise have been binned to those who need it more, such as wel­fare homes and half­way houses. But leav­ing these or­gan­i­sa­tions to fill the gap­ing hole in the food waste prob­lem is like putting a band-aid on a gush­ing wound.</p>
    <p>GOVERN­MENT IN­TER­VEN­TION</p>
    <p>If busi­nesses have sys­tems in place to track food waste, there might not be a sig­nif­i­cant amount of such waste to war­rant re­dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>With enough in­for­ma­tion on food wastage, the Govern­ment will also be bet­ter equipped to step in to re­solve this mar­ket fail­ure.</p>
    <p>This can be done ei­ther by cre­at­ing a dis­in­cen­tive for food waste gen­er­a­tion us­ing fines or im­pos­ing a tax. The Govern­ment could even grant tax ex­emp­tions for busi­nesses which do­nate ex­cess food, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­kets in France, for ex­am­ple, have been banned since 2016 from throw­ing away un­sold food. The law forces them to do­nate it to char­i­ties or food banks.</p>
    <p>Den­mark, one of the lead­ers in food waste re­duc­tion in Europe, launched a sub­sidy scheme in 2016 to sup­port projects tack­ling food waste, from pro­duc­tion to con­sump­tion. The coun­try cel­e­brated its in­au­gu­ral Na­tional Food Waste Day last Septem­ber to raise aware­ness of the is­sue.</p>
    <p>FOOD WASTE AN ETH­I­CAL IS­SUE</p>
    <p>One-third of food pro­duced for hu­man con­sump­tion – or about 1.3 bil­lion tonnes an­nu­ally – is es­ti­mated to be lost or wasted glob­ally, ac­cord­ing to the Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>This is while 800 mil­lion peo­ple in the world go to bed hun­gry ev­ery night.</p>
    <p>This makes food waste a moral is­sue not just be­cause throw­ing out food adds to the trash the world gen­er­ates, but also be­cause that food could have gone to those re­ally in need.</p>
    <p>With busi­nesses ul­ti­mately con­cerned with their bot­tom line, we can­not de­pend on them to re­duce food waste or re­dis­tribute such food out of com­pas­sion. The au­thor­i­ties must step in to de­mand more ac­count­abil­ity from busi­nesses, for in­stance, in the form of food waste au­dits.</p>
    <p>Only when enough in­for­ma­tion on how much stake­hold­ers are wast­ing is avail­able can there be mea­sures such as tax­a­tion to re­duce wastage, and work to­wards be­ing a zero-waste na­tion can be­gin.</p>
    <p>As a na­tion that im­ports most of its food, it would be easy for Sin­ga­pore to dis­re­gard the food waste is­sue. It would be con­ve­nient for us to ig­nore the en­vi­ron­men­tal ef­fects, such as pol­lu­tion and the emis­sion of greenhouse gases, on food-pro­duc­ing coun­tries from hav­ing to keep up with the global de­mand for food.</p>
    <p>It would be easy to dis­re­gard the far-reach­ing con­se­quences of throw­ing out veg­eta­bles or fruits that have gone bad in the fridge with­out a sec­ond thought.</p>
    <p>But if we are sin­cere about do­ing our part in the global fight against cli­mate change, we need to start valu­ing food, and not just love it.</p>
