    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Women’s As­so­ci­a­tion (SWA) may be best known for its an­nual beauty pageants, but its pres­i­dent Lee Li Hua says they are but a means to an end.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old points out that gala din­ners for the beauty events – which the as­so­ci­a­tion has been or­gan­is­ing since 1975 – go for a min­i­mum of $2,500 a ta­ble. And all pro­ceeds, mi­nus costs, go to char­ity.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions the SWA has helped since its in­cep­tion in 1954 in­clude the Lion’s Home, Down Syn­drome As­so­ci­a­tion and Ren Ci Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“A lot of young women want to do char­ity, but they don’t know where to start,” Ms Lee, a direc­tor with a Swisss pri­vate bank, notes.</p>
    <p>Her jour­ney with SWA started when she was in her teens. “My tu­tor was one of the found­ing mem­bers,” she says. “The as­so­ci­a­tion was known as the Siglap Girls’ Club back then.”</p>
    <p>In 1990, she be­came an ac­tive mem­ber and, in 2016, was elected SWA’s fourth pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The pur­chase of her lat­est car – a Volvo XC40 T4 – was nearly as for­tu­itous.</p>
    <p>Her pre­vi­ous car, a Volvo V40, was dam­aged when “some­one re­versed into it” early this year. She con­sid­ered buy­ing a Volk­wa­gen Golf, but could not find a vari­ant she wanted.</p>
    <p>Then, she spot­ted an XC40 on the road. “I liked it,” she says. “It looked so stylish with its white body and black top.”</p>
    <p>So, she bought one in the same black-and-white com­bi­na­tion. The new car, which she paid $149,000 for, was de­liv­ered in March – just be­fore show­rooms closed af­ter cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Even though she has clocked only about 2,000km, Ms Lee says she likes the car’s safe and solid feel.</p>
    <p>“I en­joy driv­ing,” she says, adding that she has taken her pre­vi­ous cars to Malaysia nu­mer­ous times, mainly to Jo­hor Baru and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The only time she did not quite en­joy a long haul was in a Honda Jazz. “On the high­way, you could feel the cross­winds. It was scary,” the mother of two adult chil­dren re­calls.</p>
    <p>Her son, 38, is in cor­po­rate bank­ing and works in KL, and her daugh­ter, 35, is a lawyer in Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee of­ten drives when she trav­els. “I’ve driven in the United States, Lon­don and Aus­tralia,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Once, I was in Venice with one of my girl­friends and when we col­lected the rental, it was a man­ual. She couldn’t drive a man­ual, so I ended up do­ing all the driv­ing.”</p>
    <p>The places she cov­ered over the next sev­eral days in­cluded Lake Garda, Mi­lan and Fox Town in Switzer­land – jour­neys with more than a fair share of moun­tain roads.</p>
    <p>“By the end of the jour­ney, my leg was so tired,” she says, re­fer­ring to the hun­dreds of gear changes that re­quired de­press­ing the clutch pedal.</p>
    <p>Her most re­cent driv­ing hol­i­day was dur­ing this year’s Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>“We rented a Mercedes Vito and drove i n Hun­gary, Aus­tria and Slo­vakia,” she says. This time, though, three in the group of five shared driv­ing du­ties.</p>
    <p>The size­able Vito mini­van is not the big­gest ve­hi­cle Ms Lee has driven, though. “I drove a Toy­ota Hi­ace 11-seater in Perth – twice,” she says. “First time, it was a man­ual and the other time, an auto.”</p>
    <p>She is hop­ing cross-bor­der travel can re­sume soon, so her new XC40 can prop­erly stretch its legs.</p>
