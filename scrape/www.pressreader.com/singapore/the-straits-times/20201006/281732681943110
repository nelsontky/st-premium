    <p>A Sheng Siong out­let in Tan­glin Halt was vis­ited by an in­fec­tious coro­n­avirus pa­tient on Sept 27 be­tween 6.05pm and 6.35pm, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides a list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 minutes and the times they were there so that peo­ple who were there at the same time can mon­i­tor their own health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, one new case in the com­mu­nity was an­nounced yes­ter­day. The 15-year-old girl, an In­dian na­tional, had been iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case who is her house­hold mem­ber, and was placed on quar­an­tine last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>She de­vel­oped symp­toms on Sun­day, and was tested and sub­se­quently taken to a hos­pi­tal when her test re­sult came back pos­i­tive the same day.</p>
    <p>She is a stu­dent at a pri­vate school, and was last in school last Fri­day be­fore she showed symp­toms of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>MOH did not spec­ify the school she at­tended.</p>
    <p>One im­ported pa­tient was also an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old per­ma­nent res­i­dent ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia, and tested pos­i­tive on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He did not show symp­toms when he was tested, said MOH.</p>
    <p>He was on 14-day stay-home no­tice, and was tested while at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing five of the seven new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,819.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from less than one case two weeks ago to one case in the past week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of less than one case per day over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 22 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,582 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 42 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 153 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
