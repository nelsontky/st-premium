    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Satur­day said he would nom­i­nate a woman to suc­ceed the late Supreme Court Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s de­sire to “move quickly” on the process, de­spite Democrats’ ve­he­ment op­po­si­tion, is likely to dom­i­nate the cam­paigns – along­side other hot-but­ton is­sues such as the coro­n­avirus and Amer­ica’s on­go­ing racial reck­on­ing – ahead of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s go­ing to move quickly ac­tu­ally,” Mr Trump told re­porters out­side the White House on Satur­day, adding that he thought his choice would be made this week.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing a rally in Fayet­teville, North Carolina, later that day, he took an im­promptu poll from the crowd, ask­ing them to cheer for ei­ther a woman or a man to be his pick.</p>
    <p>The crowd cheered con­sid­er­ably louder for the for­mer.</p>
    <p>“That’s a very ac­cu­rate poll be­cause that’s the way I feel. It will be a woman. A very tal­ented, very bril­liant woman, who I haven’t cho­sen yet – but we have nu­mer­ous women on the list.”</p>
    <p>He com­pli­mented two ap­peals court judges said to be on his short­list: Ms Amy Coney Bar­rett and Ms Bar­bara Lagoa.</p>
    <p>Ms Gins­burg, 87, im­mensely pop­u­lar among Democrats, died on Fri­day af­ter a long bat­tle with can­cer.</p>
    <p>Her death, just weeks be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, of­fers Repub­li­cans a chance to lock in a con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity for decades to come, on a court where jus­tices are ap­pointed for life.</p>
    <p>The stakes are high as the de­ci­sion could af­fect such weighty is­sues as abor­tion, health­care, gun con­trol and gay rights.</p>
    <p>They are pushed even higher in a bit­ter elec­tion year when the jus­tices can play a de­ci­sive role in le­gal wran­gling over a con­tested re­sult – such as when they ruled in Mr Ge­orge W. Bush’s favour to end the 2000 elec­tion de­ba­cle.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has al­ready named two jus­tices dur­ing his term as pres­i­dent – Mr Brett Ka­vanaugh and Mr Neil Gor­such – giv­ing con­ser­va­tives a 5-4 ma­jor­ity be­fore Ms Gins­burg’s death, though that does not guar­an­tee rul­ings in Mr Trump’s favour.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who is lag­ging in the polls be­hind Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den, has an­other pow­er­ful in­cen­tive to move ahead: Pro­vid­ing a jolt of en­thu­si­asm among his anti-abor­tion and evan­gel­i­cal sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>But, with al­most 45 days to go be­fore the elec­tion and early vot­ing al­ready be­gun in some states, gal­vanised Democrats are push­ing back fu­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said on Fri­day that “the vot­ers should pick the pres­i­dent and the pres­i­dent should pick the jus­tice for the Se­nate to con­sider”.</p>
    <p>While Democrats’ op­tions seem lim­ited, Se­nate Mi­nor­ity Leader Chuck Schumer told party mem­bers on Satur­day that if Repub­li­cans press ahead, then “noth­ing is off the ta­ble”, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>“This va­cancy should not be filled un­til we have a new pres­i­dent,” Mr Schumer said on Fri­day, care­fully echo­ing the words of Repub­li­can Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell in 2016, when he blocked Obama nom­i­nee Mer­rick Gar­land.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans in the­ory have the Se­nate votes to push through a Trump nom­i­nee, but could be blocked by only a hand­ful of de­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Su­san Collins be­came the first to break ranks when she an­nounced on Satur­day that she would not sup­port a</p>
    <p>vote on any Trump nom­i­nee be­fore the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Maine law­maker is among a hand­ful of mod­er­ate Repub­li­can sen­a­tors – in­clud­ing Ms Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – who have al­ready ex­pressed doubts about a rushed vote.</p>
    <p>“I to­tally dis­agree with her,” Mr Trump said of Ms Collins’ stance, re­fer­ring to his 2016 elec­tion in adding that “we have an obli­ga­tion as the win­ners to pick who we want”.</p>
    <p>One prom­i­nent Demo­cratic mem­ber of the Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee, which will over­see the con­fir­ma­tion hear­ings, is none other than Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has al­ready named scores of con­ser­va­tives as fed­eral judges, and Democrats fear a deep and last­ing shift in the bal­ance at the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts pre­dicted that Democrats would do their best to drag out the process, while fan­ning pub­lic out­rage.</p>
    <p>“Their op­tion is to build a groundswel­l... to try to con­vince at least four Repub­li­can sen­a­tors to vote ‘no’ on who­ever the Pres­i­dent puts for­ward,” Ms Amy Howe, co­founder of a Supreme Court blog, said on CNN.</p>
    <p>NU­MER­OUS CAN­DI­DATES</p>
    <p>It will be a woman. A very tal­ented, very bril­liant woman, who I haven’t cho­sen yet – but we have nu­mer­ous women on the list.</p>
