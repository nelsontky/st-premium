    <p>On Sept 16, Malaysia cel­e­brates its 57th na­tional day, hav­ing cel­e­brated on Aug 31 the 63rd an­niver­sary of its in­de­pen­dence from Bri­tain in 1957.</p>
    <p>What does in­de­pen­dence mean for for­mer colonies?</p>
    <p>It means that a na­tion is free to choose its own fu­ture in­de­pen­dence from im­pe­rial in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Lest we for­get, coloni­sa­tion in Asia ar­rived in the 16th cen­tury with Por­tuguese, Dutch and Bri­tish pi­ra­teers who came, saw and con­quered.</p>
    <p>They did this in the name of their king and Chris­tian­ity, but it was mostly for their own well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>No sta­tis­tics il­lus­trate this bet­ter than the stark fact that In­dia be­fore coloni­sa­tion in 1700 ac­counted for 24.4 per cent of world gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) (Mad­di­son, 2007) and by its in­de­pen­dence in 1947, its share was down to only 4.2 per cent in 1950.</p>
    <p>Of course, the Bri­tish left be­hind the English lan­guage, the rule of law and a durable ad­min­is­tra­tive struc­ture that is still be­ing prac­tised in many for­mer colonies.</p>
    <p>We should also be grate­ful that de­coloni­sa­tion (shed­ding of em­pire by the Euro­pean pow­ers) was en­cour­aged by the post-war Amer­i­can ad­min­is­tra­tion, which ba­si­cally did not want any chal­lenges to its dom­i­nant sta­tus, Bri­tish cousins or not.</p>
    <p>The result was that Hong Kong was the last of the colonies to lose its sta­tus in 1997.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing that some Hong Kongers are still wav­ing the Union Jack, colo­nial nos­tal­gia has not lost all its fans.</p>
    <p>What mat­ters is what the newly in­de­pen­dent coun­tries achieved with their sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the ex­em­plar that pulled it­self into the ranks of ad­vanced in­come sta­tus by sheer grit and deter­mi­na­tion, hav­ing al­most no nat­u­ral re­sources.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar, on the other hand, was richly en­dowed with nat­u­ral re­sources and had one of the best ed­u­cated elites at in­de­pen­dence in 1948. Ruled mostly by the mil­i­tary junta, its growth has been stunted rel­a­tive to its neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>The Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank has just pub­lished an ex­cel­lent book, Asia’s Jour­ney To Pros­per­ity, com­mem­o­rat­ing 50-plus years of its es­tab­lish­ment in 1966.</p>
    <p>The book tracks Asia’s trans­for­ma­tion from a post-colo­nial era of an es­sen­tially ru­ral area to to­day’s ur­ban and tech­no­log­i­cally driven re­gion that ac­counts for roughly half of global growth.</p>
    <p>Seen from a 60-year cy­cle, Asia’s trans­for­ma­tion has been world-shat­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>In 1960, de­vel­op­ing Asia (ex-Ja­pan) ac­counted for only 4.1 per cent of world GDP, mea­sured in con­stant 2010 US dol­lar terms.</p>
    <p>That year, the Euro­pean Union ac­counted for 36.2 per cent and the United States, 30.6 per cent, re­spec­tively, to­gether 18 times larger. Ja­pan was al­ready a de­vel­oped coun­try with 7 per cent of world GDP.</p>
    <p>By 2018, de­vel­op­ing Asia’s share had in­creased six times to 24 per cent, on a par with the EU (23.2 per cent) and the US (23.9 per cent). This means that in­clud­ing Ja­pan, Asia ac­counted for 31.5 per cent of world GDP.</p>
    <p>The global GDP shares for Latin Amer­ica, the Mid­dle East, Africa and rest of the world were es­sen­tially un­changed in the last half cen­tury.</p>
    <p>In other words, the loss in share of world GDP by Europe and the US be­tween 1960 and 2018 was largely gained by de­vel­op­ing Asia, of which</p>
    <p>China was in its own class. China’s GDP grew 84 times over this pe­riod, whereas the other three Asian dragons – South Korea, Tai­wan and Sin­ga­pore – grew be­tween 55 and 58 times.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, over the same pe­riod, coun­tries in the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment, in­clud­ing Ja­pan and Aus­tralia, ba­si­cally grew eight times.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is in the up­per pack, hav­ing grown by 35 times.</p>
    <p>The secrets for Asia’s suc­cess­ful trans­for­ma­tion de­serve re­peat­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pe­riod, there was peace and gen­eral po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, with Asian gov­ern­ments be­ing fis­cally pru­dent and will­ing to in­vest in in­fra­struc­ture and peo­ple. Asia did not follow the “im­port sub­sti­tu­tion” model adopted in Latin Amer­ica, but adopted the Ja­panese ex­port in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion route.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment es­sen­tially came from a young grow­ing pop­u­la­tion that shifted out of ru­ral agri­cul­ture into ur­ban cen­tres, with prag­matic gov­ern­ments work­ing hand in hand with mar­kets to cre­ate jobs in new in­dus­tries and ser­vices. This raised the sav­ings and in­vest­ment lev­els sig­nif­i­cantly above those of the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>The state took care of macroe­co­nomic sta­bil­ity, education, health and in­fra­struc­ture, pre­par­ing the labour force for for­eign and do­mes­tic en­ter­prises to pro­pel ex­ports and growth.</p>
    <p>Those economies that were most open to tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion, in­clud­ing wel­com­ing for­eign in­vest­ment, grew fastest.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, in­come dis­tri­bu­tion im­proved, but in re­cent years, in­come and wealth in­equal­i­ties have widened.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, cli­mate change is­sues in terms of weather change, impact on wa­ter, food and in­creas­ing nat­u­ral dis­as­ters, are ris­ing in the social agenda. The geopo­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­ture has also risen, with the West feel­ing more in­se­cure.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, China’s rise is seen as the main geopo­lit­i­cal ri­val for the West, since it is the West’s largest mar­ket, big­gest sup­plier, tough­est com­peti­tor and ri­val po­lit­i­cal model. But not far be­hind China are In­dia and Asean, both with cul­tur­ally di­verse, younger pop­u­la­tions, to­talling two bil­lion peo­ple and GDP of US$5.8 tril­lion (S$8 tril­lion), about to en­ter into tech­no­log­i­cally driven, mid­dle-class in­come lev­els.</p>
    <p>Both South Asia and South-east Asia are about to en­joy the same de­mo­graphic div­i­dend as China, but it will take com­pe­tent gov­ern­ments to en­sure that the rise to mid­dle and ad­vanced in­come will be ac­com­pa­nied by good jobs and fair dis­tri­bu­tion, par­tic­u­larly in the face of grow­ing pro­tec­tion­ism, and de­cou­pling in tech­nol­ogy and sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Asia’s growth must be in co­op­er­a­tion with the West, so­cially, com­mer­cially and tech­no­log­i­cally. But the great­est risks are the neo-con hawks in the West who are will­ing to risk war to dis­rupt Asia’s rise. Put sim­ply, if Asian growth stalls, the world will lose its growth engine.</p>
    <p>The rise of Asia for the rest of the cen­tury is nei­ther destiny nor pre-or­dained. The West will not sit by to see its lead­er­ship erode. But as McKin­sey’s use­ful anal­y­ses on Fu­ture Of Asia opined: “The ques­tion is no longer how quickly Asia will rise; it is how Asia will lead.”</p>
    <p>Lead­ing in a cul­tur­ally di­verse and com­plex world is not about fight­ing, but about how to work to­gether, mean­ing com­pet­ing and co­op­er­at­ing at the same time. The great­est Asian divide is not tech­nol­ogy, but social po­lar­i­sa­tion riven by race, gen­der, re­li­gion, ide­ol­ogy and health/wealth in­equal­i­ties, all ex­posed bru­tally by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>How a new gen­er­a­tion of Asian lead­ers goes about heal­ing th­ese social wounds and mov­ing for­ward with­out frag­men­ta­tion and fight­ing will be the true test of Asia’s ma­tu­rity in the next 60-year cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Asia’s growth must be in co­op­er­a­tion with the West, so­cially, com­mer­cially and tech­no­log­i­cally. But the great­est risks are the neo-con hawks in the West who are will­ing to risk war to dis­rupt Asia’s rise. Put sim­ply, if Asian growth stalls, the world will lose its growth engine.</p>
