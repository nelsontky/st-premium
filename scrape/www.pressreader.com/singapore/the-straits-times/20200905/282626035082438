    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Film­ing in Bri­tain for the lat­est Bat­man movie has been halted af­ter its star, Robert Pat­tin­son, re­port­edly tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, just days af­ter shoot­ing had re­sumed.</p>
    <p>“A mem­ber of The Bat­man pro­duc­tion has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and is iso­lat­ing in ac­cor­dance with es­tab­lished pro­to­cols,” Warner Bros said in a state­ment. “Film­ing is tem­po­rar­ily paused.”</p>
    <p>The stu­dio did not name the per­son in­fected or in­di­cate when film­ing would re­sume.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a num­ber of Hol­ly­wood trade pub­li­ca­tions – in­clud­ing Va­ri­ety and The Hol­ly­wood Re­porter – said they had con­firmed that Pat­tin­son, 34, was the sick cast mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion for the new film – a dark, de­tec­tive-style mys­tery take on the “Caped Cru­sader” – also had to shut down mid­way through pro­duc­tion in March due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Direc­tor Matt Reeves has said his ver­sion – due out next June – is in­spired by clas­sic film noir such as Chi­na­town (1974) and Taxi Driver (1976) and will meet a “very hu­man and very flawed” Bruce Wayne in his se­cond year as Bat­man, try­ing to solve a se­ries of crimes.</p>
    <p>The hotly an­tic­i­pated movie’s first footage, re­leased at the DC FanDome event last month, left fans drool­ing, with a mys­te­ri­ous vil­lain leav­ing notes for Bat­man at crime scenes across Gotham – and the film’s hero pum­melling a street thug be­fore growl­ing: “I’m vengeance.”</p>
    <p>The stop in pro­duc­tion comes as Hol­ly­wood scram­bles to get back to work af­ter the pan­demic brought a halt to film and tele­vi­sion shoots in March.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ma­jor Hol­ly­wood block­busters re­sumed film­ing in the last two months, a num­ber of them in Bri­tain, which loos­ened coro­n­avirus travel rules to al­low cast and crew to fly in for work.</p>
    <p>Among the high-pro­file films that have re­ceived the green light to re­sume pro­duc­tion are Juras­sic World: Do­min­ion, star­ring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dal­las Howard, and Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble 7, star­ring Tom Cruise.</p>
    <p>Movie pro­duc­tions in Los An­ge­les have only re­cently re­sumed, with stu­dios im­pos­ing strict safety rules on ac­tors and crew mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Pat­tin­son, who rose to fame in the ro­mance-fan­tasy Twi­light films (2008 to 2012), is the lat­est high-pro­file ac­tor to have con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Dwayne “The Rock” John­son re­vealed that his en­tire fam­ily had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, but had all re­cov­ered fully.</p>
    <p>Other Hol­ly­wood celebri­ties who have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus in­clude ac­tor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wil­son, for­mer Bond girl Olga Kurylenko and Bri­tish ac­tor Idris Elba.</p>
