    <p>Mo­bil­ity is on the move. Across Asia, rapid ur­ban­i­sa­tion, in­creas­ing as­pi­ra­tions, ac­ces­si­bil­ity to greater and faster con­ve­nience, en­hanced dig­i­tal solutions and de­creas­ing costs are en­cour­ag­ing dis­cus­sions on the fu­ture of mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s mo­bil­ity land­scape re­flects th­ese fric­tions. The coun­try’s mo­bil­ity fu­ture will be de­fined by two key themes: in­no­va­tion and sus­tain­abil­ity. But how will th­ese be achieved?</p>
    <p>This ques­tion con­tin­ues to be a key con­sid­er­a­tion for Shell, as we re­view our own strat­egy in re­sponse to na­tional and re­gional trends. As an ex­am­ple of Shell’s com­mit­ment to the fu­ture of mo­bil­ity, we have pro­duced our first re­port on mo­bil­ity in the re­gion, Cities On The Move: Driv­ing Asia’s Mo­bil­ity Rev­o­lu­tion, fo­cus­ing on a few key mar­kets in the re­gion, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE IN MO­TION</p>
    <p>One of Sin­ga­pore’s strengths in gov­er­nance is its com­mit­ment to long-term plan­ning. How­ever, a ma­jor chal­lenge for the coun­try in the next 50 years will be the pro­vi­sion of clean, af­ford­able and re­li­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>It is ap­pro­pri­ate, there­fore, to con­sider what the fu­ture of mo­bil­ity will look like in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Will ev­ery car be elec­tric, echo­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s am­bi­tion in its Bud­get this year? Will all petrol sta­tions be­come elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) charg­ing hubs in the years ahead?</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, Sin­ga­pore sees op­por­tu­ni­ties in the EV rev­o­lu­tion. This year, the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced a more sus­tain­able trans­port vi­sion, in­clud­ing the am­bi­tion to phase out all in­ter­nal com­bus­tion en­gine (ICE) ve­hi­cles by 2040. The en­hanced Ve­hic­u­lar Emis­sions Scheme takes ef­fect on Jan 1 next year, fur­ther nar­row­ing the up­front cost gap be­tween elec­tric and ICE ve­hi­cles by us­ing re­bates to nudge buy­ers to opt for lower-emis­sion ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment also an­nounced in­cen­tives for EV buy­ers for three years, and an ex­pan­sion of the EV charg­ing net­work to 28,000 points in of­fice build­ings, hous­ing es­tates and petrol sta­tions by 2030.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the fo­cus is not on EVs ex­clu­sively. Hy­dro­gen and LNG (liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas) have also been iden­ti­fied as im­por­tant sources of the coun­try’s fu­ture en­ergy mix, par­tic­u­larly for heavy-duty ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>SMARTER MO­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>To achieve its EV am­bi­tions, Sin­ga­pore will re­quire an in­fra­struc­ture sys­tem that is not only ro­bust, but also in­cludes ro­bust­ness of the na­tional grid. There is no sin­gle path­way to meet this chal­lenge, but many. A deep un­der­stand­ing of the is­sues and col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Gov­ern­ment, in­dus­try and con­sumers will be vi­tal in achiev­ing an in­te­grated so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, greater elec­tri­fi­ca­tion rep­re­sents just one as­pect of Sin­ga­pore’s mo­bil­ity fu­ture. It is also im­por­tant for the Gov­ern­ment to con­tinue man­ag­ing ve­hi­cle growth through a com­bi­na­tion of mea­sures, in­clud­ing quo­tas and land use re­stric­tions; for con­sumers to in­crease car shar­ing or ride hail­ing; and for in­dus­try to de­liver ap­pro­pri­ate dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies and data.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, it will be es­sen­tial for Sin­ga­pore to ex­pand and im­prove its pub­lic trans­port sys­tem, en­abled by dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies, to en­cour­age greater mass adop­tion away from pri­vate car use. This is in line with the Gov­ern­ment’s Land Trans­port Mas­ter Plan that eight out of 10 Sin­ga­pore house­holds will be within a 10-minute walk of a train sta­tion by 2030.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s as­pi­ra­tion for cleaner mo­bil­ity aligns with Shell’s vi­sion. Shell was the first en­ergy com­pany to of­fer EV charg­ing at its ser­vice sta­tions last year.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Green­lots, a mem­ber of the Shell group, Shell’s charg­ing net­work now spans more than 100 pub­lic and pri­vate charg­ing sta­tions in 85 lo­ca­tions is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>And we will con­tinue to in­vest in and grow this net­work. By 2030, Shell aims to have an ex­ten­sive net­work of charg­ing op­tions for its cus­tomers, all within a short drive from their lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Shell con­tin­ues to col­lab­o­rate with part­ners and the Gov­ern­ment to es­tab­lish Sin­ga­pore as a sus­tain­able city. As an ex­am­ple, Shell and the En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity re­cently es­tab­lished a joint grant pi­lot to de­velop smart and clean en­ergy solutions which would not only power Shell’s ser­vice sta­tions, but also pro­vide even faster charg­ing for EVs.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot will see the in­te­gra­tion of so­lar power and en­ergy stor­age sys­tems (ESS) to power Shell sta­tions. If suc­cess­ful, this could pave the way for the wider de­ploy­ment of ESS at ser­vice sta­tions and sup­port the adop­tion of so­lar en­ergy in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>CON­SUMERS’ MO­BIL­ITY NEEDS ARE CHANG­ING</p>
    <p>The way con­sumers ex­pe­ri­ence mo­bil­ity is chang­ing. Gone are the days when driv­ers filled up only when the fuel gauge hit “E”.</p>
    <p>Now, due to new tech­nol­ogy and sys­tems such as telem­at­ics – the com­bi­na­tion of telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion and in­for­mat­ics such as nav­i­ga­tion sys­tems and ve­hi­cle track­ing – fleet driv­ers and com­pa­nies can an­a­lyse their driv­ing pat­terns and op­ti­mise fuel con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and the use of big data to sup­port EV charg­ing, pub­lic trans­port and last-mile de­liv­ery can ac­cel­er­ate ef­fi­cien­cies and the ben­e­fits of mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>As the drive to­wards lower car­bon and sus­tain­able mo­bil­ity in­ten­si­fies, the coun­try needs mo­bil­ity de­vel­op­ments, fu­els ecosys­tems and reg­u­la­tions to meet chang­ing de­mands. Re­defin­ing the con­sumer ex­pe­ri­ence will be just as crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Com­mon to them all, though, is the im­por­tance of col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween gov­ern­ments, in­dus­try and con­sumers to an­tic­i­pate new trends and meet evolv­ing needs.</p>
