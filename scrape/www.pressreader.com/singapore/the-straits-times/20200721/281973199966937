    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has placed un­der close scru­tiny the liv­ing ar­range­ments of Sin­ga­pore’s mi­grant work­ers, who form an in­dis­pens­able core in the con­struc­tion, process, es­tate man­age­ment and ma­rine sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple have called for a re­view of the hous­ing stan­dards for worker dor­mi­to­ries, such as dou­bling the min­i­mum liv­ing space for each worker, and in­creas­ing other ameni­ties such as bath­rooms, kitchens and leisure spa­ces.</p>
    <p>The two ques­tions that di­vide com­men­ta­tors and ob­servers are who pays and who should pay for man­dated im­prove­ments in for­eign work­ers’ liv­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Who pays</p>
    <p>A cru­cial in­sight from eco­nomics is that the bur­den of taxes – or man­dated hous­ing ben­e­fits in this con­text – even if nom­i­nally paid for by em­ploy­ers, is ac­tu­ally shared between em­ploy­ers and work­ers.</p>
    <p>If em­ploy­ers are re­quired by law to foot the bill for the bet­ter hous­ing, mar­ket forces are such that they will try to shift part of the higher costs to work­ers by low­er­ing their wages.</p>
    <p>Who ac­tu­ally bears the cost bur­den – ei­ther in lower wages or out-of-pocket ex­penses – de­pends largely on the rel­a­tive bar­gain­ing power of em­ploy­ers ver­sus work­ers. That is, do em­ploy­ers’ de­mand for labour or work­ers’ sup­ply of labour re­spond more to a change in wages? The de­gree of re­spon­sive­ness to wage changes is an in­di­ca­tion of each party’s abil­ity to ab­sorb the cost in­crease.</p>
    <p>The text­book im­pli­ca­tion is that the group with lower bar­gain­ing power is less able to re­spond by chang­ing em­ploy­ment when wages change, and will end up ab­sorb­ing a larger share of the cost in­crease.</p>
    <p>This rule dic­tat­ing the tax bur­den on dif­fer­ent eco­nomic agents has been shown em­pir­i­cally in a va­ri­ety of set­tings, and the gen­eral con­sen­sus among econ­o­mists is that pay­roll taxes – whether nom­i­nally paid for by em­ploy­ers or work­ers – are usu­ally passed al­most en­tirely to work­ers in the form of lower wages.</p>
    <p>This arises be­cause em­ploy­ers’ de­mand for work­ers tends to be more re­spon­sive to changes in wages than work­ers’ sup­ply of labour. For ex­am­ple, when pay­roll taxes rise for one group of work­ers, em­ploy­ers can switch to hir­ing an­other group.</p>
    <p>When work­ers’ share of wages is cut due to a tax or cost in­crease, how­ever, they find it harder to se­cure al­ter­na­tive em­ploy­ment and are more likely to just put up with the in­crease.</p>
    <p>The fact that Sin­ga­pore is sur­rounded by coun­tries with large pop­u­la­tions of work­ers will­ing to sup­ply labour at quite low wages im­plies that th­ese mi­grant work­ers tend to have low bar­gain­ing power.</p>
    <p>Even though other coun­tries also hire mi­grant work­ers, there are sim­ply many more of th­ese work­ers than there are over­seas em­ploy­ers look­ing to hire. Also, com­pared to other po­ten­tial des­ti­na­tions in the re­gion, Sin­ga­pore re­mains a de­sir­able place to work for many work­ers, in part due to its strong cur­rency which means higher wages when con­verted back to their home cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>There­fore, if em­ploy­ers are re­quired to pro­vide bet­ter hous­ing con­di­tions, it is quite likely that mi­grant work­ers will end up hav­ing to pay for the bet­ter ameni­ties in the form of lower pay. Em­ploy­ers may pay for some of the ben­e­fits, too, but be­cause they have more al­ter­na­tive op­tions like hir­ing for­eign work­ers from new source coun­tries or im­ple­ment­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity im­prov­ing pro­cesses, mar­ket forces are such that the greater bur­den of the cost in­crease likely falls on work­ers.</p>
    <p>Some com­men­ta­tors have ar­gued that busi­nesses can and should ab­sorb the cost in­creases by re­duc­ing prof­its or pass­ing the costs on to con­sumers. But com­pa­nies are profit-seek­ing and con­sumers are price-sen­si­tive; they do not be­have ac­cord­ing to com­men­ta­tors’ moral dic­tates of how they should act.</p>
    <p>Here again, the rule that the mar­ket par­tic­i­pants with the least bar­gain­ing power bear the brunt of the in­creased costs ap­plies – and it is likely that the for­eign work­ers have less bar­gain­ing power than firms or their cus­tomers. Short of fur­ther in­ter­ven­ing in the mar­ket through price reg­u­la­tion, there is sim­ply no way of com­pelling em­ploy­ers to ab­sorb the full ex­tent of higher hous­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Some com­men­ta­tors have ar­gued that in the case of con­struc­tion, land prices may fall to com­pen­sate for any in­creases in con­struc­tion costs due to bet­ter hous­ing for for­eign work­ers. Eco­nomic mod­els pre­dict that this has to hap­pen even­tu­ally – landown­ers have low bar­gain­ing power in the long term be­cause their al­ter­na­tive is to let the land lie fal­low.</p>
    <p>But in the short term, landown­ers can still hold out for a bet­ter price while us­ing the land for its cur­rent ac­tiv­ity, and they are un­likely to bear the full cost of im­proved hous­ing. In any case, there is lit­tle ev­i­dence on how long such ad­just­ments take – the long run could span years or even decades.</p>
    <p>This chan­nel, how­ever, will prob­a­bly not have much im­pact on Hous­ing Board build-to-or­der (BTO) flats since th­ese are priced ac­cord­ing to af­ford­abil­ity. Any de­cline in land prices (when it hap­pens) sim­ply re­duces the amount the state has to sub­sidise for BTO flats.</p>
    <p>In the end, the bulk of the cost bur­den will likely be on work­ers’ wages.</p>
    <p>Who should pay</p>
    <p>Of course, many would ar­gue against mak­ing for­eign work­ers pay for im­proved hous­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>One so­lu­tion to is to set some sort of a min­i­mum wage for th­ese work­ers that would in ef­fect cover the higher ac­com­mo­da­tion costs, in this way forc­ing em­ploy­ers and con­sumers to bear the in­creased costs.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies in the United States and Bri­tain have found that min­i­mum wage hikes tend to in­crease the prices of goods. In cases where the en­vi­ron­ment is com­pet­i­tive, such as restau­rants and gro­cery stores, some stud­ies have found full pass-through, with prices ris­ing as much as labour costs. While we should be care­ful in ex­trap­o­lat­ing th­ese find­ings to the lo­cal con­text, the ba­sic mes­sage is that we should ex­pect some de­gree of price pass-through to con­sumers.</p>
    <p>An al­ter­na­tive pol­icy pro­posal that some have put for­ward is to use the tax rev­enue col­lected from for­eign worker levies to sub­sidise the costs of pro­vid­ing bet­ter hous­ing con­di­tions. There is noth­ing wrong, in prin­ci­ple, with this sug­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>If so­ci­ety places a value on this, our view is that this trans­lates into a ques­tion of whether to al­lo­cate tax dol­lars to this par­tic­u­lar so­cial aim ver­sus other com­pet­ing so­cial uses.</p>
    <p>While the re­cent de­bate sug­gests that many peo­ple want for­eign work­ers to have bet­ter liv­ing con­di­tions, it re­mains un­clear how much so­ci­ety is will­ing to bear the cost of this pro­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey con­ducted by the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion in 2019 on the at­ti­tudes of Sin­ga­pore­ans to­wards mi­grant work­ers found the ma­jor­ity to be sym­pa­thetic on sev­eral non-mon­e­tary is­sues like work con­di­tions, yet be­liev­ing that for­eign work­ers are not en­ti­tled to the same wages as lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Th­ese find­ings raise ques­tions about the ex­tent to which Sin­ga­pore­ans are will­ing to bear any in­creased costs as­so­ci­ated with pro­vid­ing bet­ter hous­ing stan­dards for mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the ques­tion of who should pay will depend on so­ci­ety’s pref­er­ences for re­dis­tri­bu­tion, and its will­ing­ness to ac­cept the as­so­ci­ated costs of pro­vid­ing the so­cial good. Eco­nomics pro­vides an ob­jec­tive ap­proach to un­der­stand­ing who pays, but find­ing a long-term so­lu­tion to the is­sue of for­eign worker hous­ing re­quires Sin­ga­pore­ans to con­sider what we value as a so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Do we want to be a so­ci­ety that takes care of our mi­grant work­ers and en­sure they have the ba­sic rights to com­fort­able and safe dwellings, and are we will­ing to bear the cost of do­ing so, sim­ply be­cause it is the right thing to do?</p>
