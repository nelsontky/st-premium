    <p>More school and co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties (CCAs) will be al­lowed to re­sume from the mid­dle of this month, af­ter the con­clu­sion of year-end ex­am­i­na­tions for pri­mary and sec­ondary schools, as well as ju­nior col­leges.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Education (MOE) said yes­ter­day that these will in­clude ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing wind in­stru­ments, and speech and drama pro­grammes. There will be a cap of five wind play­ers or five drama per­form­ers, with the manda­tory pres­ence of one teacher or in­struc­tor.</p>
    <p>Or­ches­tras within schools and ju­nior col­leges have al­ready re­sumed.</p>
    <p>Learning jour­neys and non-res­i­den­tial ac­tiv­i­ties held at the MOE’s out­door ad­ven­ture learning cen­tres may also re­sume, as well as sev­eral in­ter-school ac­tiv­i­ties, such as lo­cal Olympiads.</p>
    <p>CCAs held at sport­ing venues such as golf, bowl­ing and swim­ming will also be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Up to 50 peo­ple will be al­lowed to take part in these ac­tiv­i­ties as Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally eases Covid-19 curbs. This will take im­me­di­ate ef­fect and will more than dou­ble the par­tic­i­pants al­lowed from a pre­vi­ous 20.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional School Games (NSG) and Sin­ga­pore Youth Fes­ti­val Arts Pre­sen­ta­tion will re­sume next year. So will Out­ward Bound Sin­ga­pore learning ac­tiv­i­ties, MOE added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the min­istry said ac­tiv­i­ties will re­sume with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The 1m dis­tance be­tween stu­dents will still ap­ply. When they prac­tise sports while un­masked, they should stay at least 2m apart.</p>
    <p>For ac­tiv­i­ties where a 1m dis­tance can­not be main­tained, stu­dents must abide by the “group of five” rule. High-touch points and com­mon fa­cil­i­ties must also be wiped down at the end of each ac­tiv­ity or change in groups.</p>
    <p>Queensway Sec­ondary School girls’ foot­ball coach Merah Ah­mad, 63, said her team is look­ing for­ward to the NSG next year.</p>
    <p>“Train­ing has not been ‘nor­mal’ but the girls al­ways give their 100 per cent, even in Zoom train­ing ses­sions. They have also been giv­ing each other moral sup­port,” she said.</p>
    <p>MOE said that fur­ther de­tails on the ac­tiv­i­ties re­sum­ing next year will be avail­able at a later stage.</p>
    <p>CCAs and ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing singing re­main sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv­i­ties with high lev­els of body con­tact such as taek­wondo spar­ring and rugby scrum and tackle, as well as overnight camps, are also not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>MOE said that CCA ex­pe­ri­ences and school ac­tiv­i­ties are im­por­tant for the well-be­ing and over­all de­vel­op­ment of the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Education Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day: “We are tak­ing a care­ful and de­lib­er­ate ap­proach in re­sum­ing school ac­tiv­i­ties, as these are im­por­tant el­e­ments of our stu­dents’ holis­tic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing back to how things were be­fore... But step by step, we can achieve a ‘new nor­mal’ in our schools, en­abling our stu­dents to ben­e­fit from a holis­tic education, in a safe, healthy and sup­port­ive en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>A NEW NOR­MAL IN SCHOOLS</p>
    <p>We are tak­ing a care­ful and de­lib­er­ate ap­proach in re­sum­ing school ac­tiv­i­ties, as these are im­por­tant el­e­ments of our stu­dents’ holis­tic de­vel­op­ment... Step by step, we can achieve a ‘new nor­mal’ in our schools, en­abling our stu­dents to ben­e­fit from a holis­tic education, in a safe, healthy and sup­port­ive en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
