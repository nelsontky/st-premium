    <p>SEX­UAL ABUSE SUR­VIVOR EL­IZ­A­BETH TEO, who es­tab­lished safes­paces.sg to of­fer hyp­nother­apy to oth­ers like her.</p>
    <p>The trauma of deal­ing with sex­ual abuse left Ms El­iz­a­beth Teo de­pressed and sui­ci­dal for years af­ter the abuse ended.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo, 35, strug­gled for years to come to terms with the abuse that started when she was 19, which con­tin­ued for three years.</p>
    <p>Her suf­fer­ing seemed to in­ten­sify af­ter the abuse stopped and also af­fected her ca­reer as a teacher. She said: “I did my best to pre­tend it never hap­pened and tried to move on with my life. I im­mersed my­self in work to forget what had hap­pened to me.”</p>
    <p>Ms Teo suf­fered flash­backs and break­downs for years, los­ing her ap­petite and even self-harm­ing.</p>
    <p>“I at­tempted sui­cide three times be­cause I just wanted the pain to end,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Once, I was ar­rested for my sui­cide at­tempt. As I lay hand­cuffed to the hos­pi­tal bed, I started cry­ing be­cause here I was in chains while my abuser was out there some­where scot-free.”</p>
    <p>In­ter­ac­tions with a priest and ther­a­pist who asked Ms Teo to con­sider whether her ac­tions had in­vited the abuse led her fur­ther down the path of self-blame.</p>
    <p>“The turn­ing point in my heal</p>
    <p>ing came in a change of ther­a­pist. My new psy­chi­a­trist spent an en­tire year to con­vince me that the abuse was not my fault,” she said. “It took about 11/ years of in­ten</p>
    <p>2 sive ther­apy, but I got bet­ter. It took me 15 years to have the courage to make a po­lice re­port about the abuse.”</p>
    <p>While the case was even­tu­ally dropped, Ms Teo’s ex­pe­ri­ence spurred her to es­tab­lish safes­paces.sg to of­fer hyp­nother­apy to oth­ers like her.</p>
    <p>She is also a free­lance fa­cil­i­ta­tor, cre­at­ing safe spa­ces in her work­shops for par­tic­i­pants to tell their stories and find heal­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, Ms Teo joined lo­cal non-profit The White­hat­ters and cri­sis shel­ter Casa Raudha to kick-off a 12-month cam­paign, called A Hold­ing Space, that of­fers re­sources like free on­line coun­selling ses­sions and pro bono le­gal con­sul­ta­tions to sex­ual abuse sur­vivors seek­ing help.</p>
    <p>Monthly sup­port group ses­sions will be held over the next year, en­gag­ing sex­ual abuse sur­vivors in 90-minute on­line ses­sions which are open to women aged 21 and above and lim­ited to 10 peo­ple at a time.</p>
    <p>The White­hat­ters founder Shahrany Has­san said the cam­paign was a re­sponse to anec­dotes from peers who had opened up about their sex­ual abuse. “Sev­eral were young when it hap­pened and are only com­ing to terms with it now in adult­hood. Oth­ers were abused as adults by in­di­vid­u­als in po­si­tions of power and in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>“Know­ing that, we had to do some­thing. We be­lieve that some­times all it takes to make things bet­ter is a lit­tle sup­port.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Teo, the ini­tia­tive is a way to reach out and em­power other sur­vivors who may be able to re­late to the chal­lenges and trauma she has dealt with.</p>
