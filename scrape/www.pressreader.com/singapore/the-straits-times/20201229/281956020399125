    <p>NTUC First Cam­pus (NFC) will loan iPads to more than 2,000 low­in­come fam­i­lies and their chil­dren at­tend­ing its pre-schools over the next three years, to help bridge the dig­i­tal di­vide.</p>
    <p>Un­der a new scheme called Dig­i­tal Kam­pung Pro­gramme, the de­vices will be loaned out on a short­term ba­sis of up to three months each time.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies with monthly house­hold in­comes of $4,500 or less, or monthly per capita in­comes of $1,125 or less, are el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>Their chil­dren should be in Kin­der­garten 1 or Kin­der­garten 2 in one of NFC’s My First Skool cen­tres.</p>
    <p>They need to have hit at least 50 per cent at­ten­dance in the month prior to qual­ify.</p>
    <p>In a me­dia re­lease last week, the pre-school op­er­a­tor said the iPads will come with ed­u­ca­tional ma­te­ri­als and mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tions to sup­port chil­dren’s learn­ing and en­cour­age high-qual­ity screen time, as well as re­sources for par­ents to com­mu­ni­cate with the pre-school on­line.</p>
    <p>Par­ents will also re­ceive a starter kit that con­tains a guide on how to use the de­vice, along with tips on screen time and cy­ber well­ness.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, NFC will pro­vide SIM cards for low-in­come fam­i­lies with­out Wi-Fi ac­cess so that they can ac­cess the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is fully sup­ported by a do­na­tion from FairPrice Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The char­ity arm of the su­per­mar­ket chain an­nounced last Wed­nes­day that it gave $250,000 to NFC’s Bright Hori­zons Fund.</p>
    <p>This sum will sup­port the Dig­i­tal Kam­pung Pro­gramme from next year to 2023.</p>
    <p>FairPrice Foun­da­tion do­nated the same amount to NTUC Health’s El­der­care Trust, which pro­vides fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to se­niors.</p>
    <p>The money will go to­wards sup­port­ing NTUC Health’s in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy in­fra­struc­ture to ben­e­fit more than 5,000 se­niors.</p>
    <p>Mrs Phoon Chew Ping, NFC’s deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer (de­vel­op­ment), said: “With Covid-19 dis­rupt­ing the ed­u­ca­tion land­scape, NFC has lever­aged tech­nol­ogy to sup­port chil­dren’s learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise that some of our low-in­come fam­i­lies and chil­dren risk fall­ing be­hind as they lack the nec­es­sary dig­i­tal de­vices and know-how.”</p>
    <p>Madam Susi­lawati Tham­rin, whose youngest daugh­ter Ale­sha Nur Sha­reefa Haminor­rashid, five, at­tends a My First Skool cen­tre in Toa Payoh, will ben­e­fit from the pro­gramme next year.</p>
    <p>Last month, the 44-year-old fast­food restau­rant worker learnt how to use an iPad loaned to her fam­ily as part of a pilot.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the de­vice, she got to watch her six-year-old daugh­ter</p>
    <p>Azleen Nur Aishyah’s K2 grad­u­a­tion con­cert over Zoom and joined a vir­tual work­shop to learn how to cook healthy banana pan­cakes and spaghetti for her chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Madam Susi­lawati, who has six chil­dren aged five to 21, said: “The pic­tures in the starter kit helped me to learn how to use the iPad.”</p>
    <p>Her hus­band works as a food de­liv­ery rider and their monthly house­hold in­come is $1,400.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, Ale­sha had to share a lap­top with three of her sib­lings. We loaned the lap­top from her sib­ling’s pri­mary school but have since re­turned it,” said Madam Susi­lawati.</p>
    <p>“It was very dif­fi­cult dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod be­cause all of them would be fight­ing for the lap­top.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing the iPad at home meant Ale­sha could re­in­force cer­tain con­cepts she learnt in school.</p>
    <p>“She en­joys us­ing ed­u­ca­tional apps on the iPad to learn spell­ing and count­ing,” said Madam Susi­lawati.</p>
