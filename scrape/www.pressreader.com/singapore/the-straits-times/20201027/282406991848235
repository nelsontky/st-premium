    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Half a dozen. That is how many times com­poser Gabriela Lena Frank reck­ons she has vis­ited the gro­cery store since the coron­avirus hit.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band have oth­er­wise been able to fend for them­selves: Their 6ha farm in Men­do­cino County, Cal­i­for­nia, laid out in Inca-style ter­races on a red­woodrich moun­tain slope, is home to chick­ens, bees, veg­etable patches and dozens of fruit trees.</p>
    <p>In a nor­mal year, the farm would also have been bustling with young com­posers. Since 2017, it has been the home of the Gabriela Lena Frank Cre­ative Academy of Mu­sic, an in­no­va­tive train­ing in­sti­tu­tion that aims to foster di­verse com­po­si­tional voices.</p>
    <p>The core pro­gramme is a year­long ap­pren­tice­ship spread over mul­ti­ple short vis­its, but the academy also nur­tures per­form­ers and fa­cil­i­tates com­mis­sions for its grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>The virus forced its ac­tiv­i­ties on­line, but even with­out it, the smoky haze from re­cent wild­fires in the re­gion would have made in-per­son work dif­fi­cult. The clas­si­cal mu­sic world has seen many cli­mate change ini­tia­tives, but few artists have ex­am­ined the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of their own prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Frank, 48, said she had long been con­cerned about the mu­sic in­dus­try’s busi­ness as usual.</p>
    <p>“I built a sub­stan­tial ca­reer on fly­ing,” she said. “Even be­fore the pan­demic, I thought, ‘We have to do some things re­motely.’”</p>
    <p>She said the in­creas­ing fe­roc­ity of the wild­fires in the West had made her re­alise the dan­ger of cli­mate change “is here and present and it needs to be grasped”.</p>
    <p>Di­ver­sity and sus­tain­abil­ity have been pre­oc­cu­pa­tions for Frank, who was hon­oured this month with a US$250,000 (S$340,000) Heinz Award, given in a va­ri­ety of arts and pol­icy dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>Her work celebrates the roots of a fam­ily tree that in­cludes her Peruvian mother, a fa­ther de­scended from Lithua­nian Jews and a Chi­nese great-grand­fa­ther who sold sup­plies to An­dean min­ers.</p>
    <p>In her mu­sic, it is the Peruvian her­itage that comes through most clearly, with folk melodies wo­ven into high-spir­ited pieces full of vi­brant colours, slic­ing rhythms and volatile tex­tures that con­tract, swell and warp.</p>
    <p>She of­ten sub­verts au­ral ex­pec­ta­tions. A string quar­tet might briefly con­jure the sound of pan flutes through clever use of har­mon­ics. In Rit­mos Anchi­nos, writ­ten for the Silk Road En­sem­ble, a Chi­nese pipa takes on the guise of a cha­rango, a Peruvian man­dolin.</p>
    <p>Her Sonata An­d­ina for pi­ano is mus­cu­lar, play­ful and cheer­fully com­bat­ive. The pi­ano was her cho­sen in­stru­ment – even be­fore she could hear. Her near-pro­found hear­ing loss was de­tected only when she was four. Un­til then, she had been a happy but quiet child.</p>
    <p>She stud­ied com­po­si­tion at Rice Univer­sity and earned her doc­tor­ate at the Univer­sity of Michi­gan; com­mis­sions around the coun­try fol­lowed. But while her ca­reer blos­somed, she felt her out­sider sta­tus keenly: a woman of Latino de­scent with a dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>And she saw how dif­fi­cult it was for oth­ers to pry open the gates. In found­ing her academy, she set out not only to nur­ture new voices but also to en­cour­age al­ter­na­tive mu­si­cal ca­reers, grounded in ac­tivism and ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In Boonville, where her farm is, she teaches evening classes and vol­un­teers at the lo­cal mid­dle school, which serves many chil­dren of un­doc­u­mented agri­cul­tural work­ers.</p>
    <p>Frank opens the door to ap­pli­cants who might not gain en­try to stan­dard con­ser­va­to­ries. In 2017, An­jna Swami­nathan was a vi­olin­ist deeply con­ver­sant in Car­natic mu­sic. But, she said in a re­cent tele­phone in­ter­view, she as­sumed com­po­si­tion was closed to her be­cause she came out of an oral tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Frank en­cour­aged her to ap­ply. The men­tor­ship, Swami­nathan said, taught her how to read and write mu­sic, but also how “to cre­ate a dig­nity and own­er­ship around my own voice while nav­i­gat­ing new ter­ri­tory”.</p>
    <p>“She’s got this nur­tur­ing charisma about her,” Swami­nathan said of Frank. “All the good things about moth­er­hood and fem­i­nin­ity and fa­mil­iar­ity are brought into this scary space. Her home is in the mid­dle of a moun­tain. There’s dogs ev­ery­where, and chick­ens. It shows you that mu­sic mak­ing is an earthly thing, so why not con­nect to the earth while we make it?”</p>
