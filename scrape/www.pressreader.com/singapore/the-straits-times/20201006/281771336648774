    <p>As US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump con­tin­ues to be treated at Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre, doc­tors and senior White House staff mem­bers have given con­flict­ing up­dates about his con­di­tion, treat­ments and when he learned he was in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>A time­line of events about Mr Trump’s ill­ness has been drawn from his tweets, news con­fer­ences, state­ments from the White House and re­port­ing from The New York Times.</p>
    <p>LAST WED­NES­DAY</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his team trav­elled to Min­nesota for a rally last­ing about 45 minutes – about half the length of his typ­i­cal cam­paign speeches.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the event, one of Mr Trump’s clos­est ad­vis­ers, Ms Hope Hicks, started to ex­pe­ri­ence symp­toms re­lated to the virus.</p>
    <p>On the re­turn trip, Mr Trump slept as some of his ad­vis­ers spoke about the con­di­tion of Ms Hicks, who was iso­lated in the back of the plane.</p>
    <p>THURS­DAY</p>
    <p>News that Ms Hicks tested pos­i­tive for the virus came as Mr Trump left the White House by he­li­copter around 1pm for a fund-raiser at his golf club in Bed­min­ster, New Jersey.</p>
    <p>At the event, Mr Trump ap­peared be­fore hun­dreds of sup­port­ers, both in­doors and out­doors. One per­son who saw the Pres­i­dent there said he was in con­tact with about 100 peo­ple and ap­peared lethar­gic.</p>
    <p>On a call with Iowa vot­ers and in an in­ter­view with Mr Sean Han­nity on Fox News, Mr Trump sounded raspy. Later that night, Mr Trump and First Lady Me­la­nia Trump tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, of­fi­cials said. Mr Trump had a mild cough, nasal con­ges­tion and fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>FRI­DAY</p>
    <p>Close to 1am, Mr Trump said on Twit­ter that he and his wife had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Later in the morn­ing, Mr Trump had a high fever and his oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion lev­els dipped be­low 94 per cent, Dr Sean Con­ley, the White House physi­cian, said.</p>
    <p>The doc­tor rec­om­mended that Mr Trump be given sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen.</p>
    <p>“He was fairly adamant that he didn’t need it,” Dr Con­ley said. “He was not short of breath. He was tired, had the fever, but that was about it.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter about a minute on 2 litres of sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen, Mr Trump’s sat­u­ra­tion lev­els were back over 95 per cent, Dr Con­ley said. The Pres­i­dent stayed on the sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen for about an hour at the White House.</p>
    <p>That evening, Mr Trump was taken to Wal­ter Reed for a more thor­ough eval­u­a­tion and mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­ceived an 8g dose of an ex­per­i­men­tal poly­clonal an­ti­body com­bi­na­tion. He also took zinc, vi­ta­min D, famo­ti­dine, mela­tonin and as­pirin.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent was also given his first dose of remde­sivir, an an­tivi­ral drug that has an emer­gency ap­proval from the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion as a Covid-19 ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has mild heart dis­ease, sim­i­lar to many men in their 70s. He also takes a statin drug to treat high choles­terol and as­pirin to pre­vent heart at­tacks. His health sum­mary, re­leased in June, showed that he crossed the line into obe­sity at more than 110kg.</p>
    <p>SATUR­DAY</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s blood oxy­gen level dropped for a sec­ond time to about 93 per cent, which some ex­perts describe as a po­ten­tial in­di­ca­tor of se­vere Covid-19, al­though it was un­clear if he re­ceived any sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was given the steroid dex­am­etha­sone, which has been used to treat dis­eases like lu­pus, arthri­tis and can­cer.</p>
    <p>A study con­ducted by sci­en­tists at the Univer­sity of Ox­ford showed the drug re­duced deaths of Covid-19 pa­tients on oxy­gen by one-fifth.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was given a sec­ond dose of remde­sivir and did not ex­hibit any known side ef­fects, doc­tors said.</p>
    <p>Dr Con­ley said that, as of that night, Mr Trump re­mained “fever-free and off sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen”.</p>
    <p>“While not yet out of the woods, the team re­mains cau­tiously op­ti­mistic,” Dr Con­ley said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Mead­ows, the White House chief of staff, of­fered a more som­bre de­scrip­tion of the Pres­i­dent’s health, gen­er­at­ing scep­ti­cism over Dr Con­ley’s ini­tial news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent’s vi­tals over the last 24 hours were very con­cern­ing, and the next 48 hours will be crit­i­cal in terms of his care,” Mr Mead­ows told re­porters. “We’re still not on a clear path to a full re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>In a video shared on Twit­ter, Mr Trump said he was “start­ing to feel good” and thanked sup­port­ers and well-wish­ers.</p>
    <p>SUN­DAY</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s blood oxy­gen level im­proved to 98 per cent, Dr Con­ley said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors wanted him to eat, drink and be out of bed as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s med­i­cal team hinted at the pos­si­bil­ity that he might be dis­charged to the White House as early as Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors were track­ing any dam­age to his lungs for signs of pneu­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>“There’s some ex­pected find­ings, but noth­ing of any ma­jor clin­i­cal con­cern,” Dr Con­ley said.</p>
