    <p>Frasers Centrepoin­t Trust (FCT) is propos­ing to raise up to $1.39 bil­lion in eq­uity to fund its ac­qui­si­tion of the re­main­ing 63.1 per cent of Asi­aRe­tail Fund for $1.06 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Asi­aRe­tail Fund owns five malls in Sin­ga­pore – Tiong Bahru Plaza, White Sands, Hougang Mall, Cen­tury Square and Tampines 1 – as well as one of­fice prop­erty, Cen­tral Plaza.</p>
    <p>If the ac­qui­si­tion goes through, FCT’s re­tail prop­er­ties in its port­fo­lio will in­crease from seven to 11, and its net let­table area will ex­pand by about 64 per cent to 2.3 mil­lion sq ft. This places FCT among the largest sub­ur­ban re­tail mall own­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>FCT’s port­fo­lio size will i ncrease to ap­prox­i­mately $6.65 bil­lion, from $3.96 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>It cur­rently has seven sub­ur­ban re­tail prop­er­ties i n Sin­ga­pore, namely Cause­way Point, North­point City North Wing (in­clud­ing Yishun 10 Re­tail Podium), An­chor­point, YewTee Point, Be­dok Point, Changi City Point and Wa­ter­way Point (40 per cent in­ter­est).</p>
    <p>To fund the ac­qui­si­tion and pare down ex­ist­ing debt, FCT’s man­ager is propos­ing to is­sue up to 628 mil­lion new units in the trust, rep­re­sent­ing around 56.1 per cent of the to­tal num­ber of is­sued units.</p>
    <p>Based on the il­lus­tra­tive is­sue price of $2.22 per new unit, the pro­posed eq­uity fund rais­ing is ex­pected to raise gross pro­ceeds of up to $1.39 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Asi­aRe­tail Fund also owns Se­ta­pak Cen­tral, a mall in Kuala Lumpur, which it pro­poses to di­vest to FCT’s spon­sor for a sale price of $39.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>FCT also plans to di­vest Be­dok Point to its spon­sor for a sale price of $108 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>On a pro forma ba­sis, these trans­ac­tions are ex­pected to pro­vide 8.59 per cent dis­tri­bu­tion per unit ac­cre­tion based on FCT’s FY2019 fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Sub­ur­ban malls re­main an at­trac­tive as­set class, FCT said, not­ing that more than 99 per cent of the re­tail­ers in the Asi­aRe­tail Fund’s Sin­ga­pore re­tail as­sets and FCT’s ex­ist­ing port­fo­lio have re­sumed busi­ness since phase 2 of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing on June 19.</p>
    <p>“The pace of the re­cov­ery has demon­strated the re­silience of sub­ur­ban re­tail malls through chal­leng­ing times,” it added.</p>
    <p>The ac­qui­si­tion fee payable to the real es­tate investment trust man­ager for the pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion is ap­prox­i­mately $19.3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Stamp du­ties, pro­fes­sional fees and other ex­penses to be in­curred in con­nec­tion with the ac­qui­si­tion and the pro­posed eq­uity fund rais­ing are es­ti­mated at $32.1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>FCT will con­vene an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing on Sept 28 to seek unit hold­ers’ ap­proval for the pro­posed trans­ac­tions.</p>
