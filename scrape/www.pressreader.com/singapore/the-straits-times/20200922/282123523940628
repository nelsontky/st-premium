    <p>The prob­lems re­lated to voyeurism have been high­lighted in re­cent years (NUS stu­dent filmed women in shower on cam­pus, Sept 12).</p>
    <p>This is a press­ing is­sue. A univer­sity’s cam­pus should be a safe space for both men and women – no one should face the threat of voyeurism when tak­ing a shower within cam­pus grounds.</p>
    <p>This is not just an is­sue for the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, it is a prob­lem for Sin­ga­pore as a whole. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant to­day, where the ease of ac­cess to de­vices with video record­ing func­tions has en­abled those who want to take voyeuris­tic im­ages and videos.</p>
    <p>This makes me feel un­safe. Women are gen­er­ally told to be more aware of their sur­round­ings and to pro­tect them­selves. How about ed­u­cat­ing those who are in­ter­ested in voyeuris­tic im­ages and videos?</p>
    <p>Vic­tim blam­ing should not be al­lowed to hap­pen. This merely makes the vic­tims feel worse when they should be sup­ported. Any­one can be a vic­tim – no mat­ter how many mea­sures they take to pre­vent it.</p>
    <p>This voyeurism prob­lem needs to be tar­geted at its source.</p>
    <p>This has to start with ed­u­ca­tion – that voyeurism is wrong. It is not too late to start ed­u­cat­ing the pop­u­la­tion. Those stay­ing on cam­pus can be ed­u­cated about the con­se­quences of voyeurism. The uni­ver­si­ties can take a stricter stand against those who still choose to take voyeuris­tic videos and im­ages.</p>
    <p>These steps, al­though small, can lead to change in how the pub­lic views voyeurism and the fre­quency of such cases hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>Women are gen­er­ally told to be more aware of their sur­round­ings and to pro­tect them­selves. How about ed­u­cat­ing those who are in­ter­ested in voyeuris­tic im­ages and videos?</p>
