    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has im­posed tougher reg­u­la­tions across a large swathe of Eng­land as it tries to stamp down on the mu­tant strain of coro­n­avirus that is spread­ing quickly across the coun­try. From to­mor­row, ar­eas such as Sus­sex and Suffolk will face the strictest rules in the coun­try’s four-tier sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has im­posed tougher reg­u­la­tions across a large swathe of Eng­land in an ef­fort to stamp down on the mu­tant strain of coro­n­avirus that’s spread­ing quickly across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sus­sex, Ox­ford­shire, Suffolk, Nor­folk, Cam­bridgeshir­e, most of Hamp­shire and the re­main­der of Es­sex will now face the strictest rules in the gov­ern­ment’s four-tier sys­tem from to­mor­row, Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said on Wed­nes­day in a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>They join Lon­don and south-east Eng­land, where only es­sen­tial shops, such as su­per­mar­kets and phar­ma­cies, are al­lowed to stay open, and peo­ple are re­quired to stay home ex­cept for work, med­i­cal ap­point­ments or emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of a house­hold are not al­lowed to meet other peo­ple in­doors, and can only meet one other per­son from another house­hold out­doors.</p>
    <p>The new vari­ant “is spread­ing at a dan­ger­ous rate”, said Mr Han­cock, put­ting the rise in cases in the past week at 57 per cent. “The di­rec­tion is clear and in many cases quite stark.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is strug­gling to bring the virus back un­der con­trol af­ter the new mu­tant strain be­gan spread­ing rapidly in Lon­don and sur­round­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an Eng­land-wide l ock­down last month halted growth in in­fec­tions, the virus has since started spread­ing ex­po­nen­tially again, risk­ing over­whelm­ing the Na­tional Health Ser­vice as cases tick up­wards.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom re­ported 39,237 new coro­n­avirus cases on Wed­nes­day, the big­gest daily in­crease since the pan­demic be­gan. Another 744 deaths were re­ported within 28 days of a pos­i­tive test, the high­est since the end of April.</p>
    <p>While min­is­ters hold out hope that a vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme that started this month means the re­stric­tions can start to be eased in the spring, Mr Han­cock warned that the new mu­ta­tion com­pli­cates mat­ters. “This Christ­mas and the start of 2021 is go­ing to be tough,” he said. “The new vari­ant makes ev­ery­thing much harder be­cause it spreads so much faster.”</p>
    <p>The new virus vari­ant, which emerged in south-east Eng­land in Septem­ber, has alarmed sci­en­tists and gov­ern­ments around the world be­cause early anal­y­sis sug­gests it may be as much as 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble than other cir­cu­lat­ing strains.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries in­clud­ing France tem</p>
    <p>porar­ily sus­pended travel from the UK in re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Mr Han­cock also said that two new cases of an even more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant orig­i­nat­ing in South Africa have so far been de­tected in the UK. He told peo­ple who re­cently re­turned from South Africa to go into quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Trans­port Min­is­ter Grant Shapps or­dered flights and ar­rivals from South Africa to be halted from yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while China said yes­ter­day it will sus­pend di­rect flights to and from the UK, cit­ing the emer­gence of the new virus strain. “Af­ter much con­sid­er­a­tion, China has de­cided to take ref­er­ence from others coun­tries and sus­pend flights to and from the UK,” for­eign min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told re­porters at a daily brief­ing.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently eight weekly flights be­tween main­land China and the UK, ac­cord­ing to avi­a­tion data provider Var­i­flight.</p>
    <p>Over 40 other coun­tries have</p>
    <p>tight­ened re­stric­tions on trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from the UK.</p>
    <p>The lat­est lock­down de­ci­sion in Bri­tain means that from to­mor­row, 24 mil­lion peo­ple will be in tier 4, 25 mil­lion in tier 3, and seven mil­lion in tier 2.</p>
    <p>The just over 2,000 res­i­dents of the Isles of Scilly off the south­west coast will be the only peo­ple left in tier 1 in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Across the UK, the re­pro­duc­tion fac­tor of the virus – the so-called R num­ber – is now be­tween 1.1 and 1.3, the gov­ern­ment said in a state­ment. That means ev­ery 10 in­fected peo­ple spread the virus to another 11 to 13 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The rate has in­creased since Novem­ber, when a lock­down in Eng­land helped push it be­low 1, mean­ing the out­break was shrink­ing.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is now par­tic­u­larly acute in Lon­don and eastern Eng­land, where the R may be as high as 1.5, ac­cord­ing to Wed­nes­day’s state­ment.</p>
