    <p>NEW YORK • Rare twin storms have formed over the Caribbean, pack­ing pow­er­ful winds and heavy rain as they head to­wards the Gulf of Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>Trop­i­cal Storm Marco has top winds of 65kmh and was fore­cast to cross Mex­ico’s Yu­catan Penin­sula late yes­ter­day, the United States Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said in an ad­vi­sory at 11pm in New York on</p>
    <p>Fri­day. Trop­i­cal Storm Laura has top winds of 72kmh and is ex­pected to move west across much of the Greater An­tilles this week­end, said the hur­ri­cane cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Laura has prompted warn­ings from the Caribbean to Puerto Rico and the Ba­hamas, while Mex­ico is­sued trop­i­cal storm watches along the Yu­catan coast­line.</p>
    <p>Both sys­tems are likely to reach the gulf early this week as Cat­e­gory 1 hur­ri­canes, threat­en­ing peo­ple and oil and nat­u­ral gas pro­duc­tion. As the two storms get closer, they could in­flu­ence each other.</p>
    <p>“It is ob­vi­ously a sit­u­a­tion that could change quite a bit,” said Mr Brad Har­vey, a me­te­o­rol­o­gist with com­mer­cial fore­caster Maxar. “Any­where along the Gulf of Mex­ico has a po­ten­tial threat from this.”</p>
    <p>No­ble Corp is al­ready mov­ing two off­shore rigs out of the storms’ path. BHP has be­gun evac­u­at­ing em­ploy­ees from its four op­er­ated plat­forms in the gulf and is beginning to shut pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Storms in the gulf, even weak ones, can dis­rupt en­ergy mar­kets. In June, a weak Trop­i­cal Storm Cris­to­bal knocked out about onethird of off­shore oil and nat­u­ral gas pro­duc­tion in the gulf. The re­gion ac­counts for about 16 per cent of crude and 2.4 per cent of US nat­u­ral gas out­put.</p>
    <p>The last time two storms ranged through the gulf at the same time was 1959, said Dr Phil Klotzbach, lead au­thor of the Colorado State Univer­sity sea­sonal hur­ri­cane fore­cast. The only other time was in 1933.</p>
