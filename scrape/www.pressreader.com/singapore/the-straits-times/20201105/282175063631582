    <p>It was a case that held the at­ten­tion of much of the na­tion. Some ob­servers de­picted it as a David ver­sus Go­liath bat­tle: a do­mes­tic helper ac­cused of theft who won a court case against a well-off fam­ily. Oth­ers were quick to ac­cuse the po­lice and ju­di­ciary of bias over how mat­ters were han­dled.</p>
    <p>Set­ting the record straight yes­ter­day, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam spoke at length on the case of Ms Parti Liyani, the maid in ques­tion.</p>
    <p>He touched on two as­pects: First, the sub­stan­tive facts of the case, from investigat­ions to trial and judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the larger is­sue of whether it was han­dled dif­fer­ently be­cause of the sta­tus of for­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong – whose fam­ily Ms Parti worked for – and whether there was im­proper in­flu­ence by the Liews.</p>
    <p>His cen­tral point was this: The po­lice and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) had suf­fi­cient grounds to charge Ms Parti. They did not act at the fam­ily’s be­hest.</p>
    <p>“This is how our sys­tem is sup­posed to work,” he said.</p>
    <p>That the High Court would go on to dis­agree and over­turn her con­vic­tion on two counts – a break in the chain of cus­tody of items said to be stolen; and rea­son­able doubt as to whether the Liews had im­proper mo­tives – again showed that the sys­tem works, he added.</p>
    <p>In the marathon 10-hour de­bate that fol­lowed, end­ing just be­fore mid­night, MPs un­peeled the struc­ture of the ju­di­cial sys­tem, prac­ti­cal chal­lenges fac­ing en­force­ment agen­cies, and the bar­ri­ers to aid that some Sin­ga­pore­ans con­tinue to face.</p>
    <p>There were four is­sues of note. These went to the heart of the is­sue of public per­cep­tion, in some quar­ters, that one set of laws ex­ists for the well-con­nected, and another for the rest of so­ci­ety:</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>WAS MS PARTI GUILTY?</p>
    <p>Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong GRC) spoke of what was on ev­ery­one’s minds when he asked, point­edly, whether Ms Parti was guilty.</p>
    <p>“The case was orig­i­nally seen as one in­volv­ing a wealthy com­plainant fix­ing their for­eign do­mes­tic worker,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It seems now that the case is re­ally about wealthy peo­ple who are cav­a­lier in deal­ing with a for­eign do­mes­tic worker, who had, on her part, not ex­actly acted well.”</p>
    <p>Ms Parti de­clined on two oc­ca­sions to lodge a com­plaint with the Man­power Min­istry – but then did so, with re­gard to her il­le­gal de­ploy­ment, only after she was charged.</p>
    <p>She also ad­mit­ted to tak­ing items of cloth­ing with­out per­mis­sion, and made many in­con­sis­tent state­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam replied and re­minded that Ms Parti was ac­quit­ted by the High Court. On his part, he said he was putting across the facts and giv­ing cer­tain char­ac­ter­i­sa­tions of those in­volved.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>RE­CUSE OR RE­STRUC­TURE?</p>
    <p>Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh (Alju­nied GRC) called for the of­fice of the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral to be split into two of­fices – that of a public pros­e­cu­tor, and that of le­gal ad­viser to the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent du­al­ity of roles in one per­son brought with it a po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­est, he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that the cur­rent At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s re­cusal from the re­view of this case showed his recog­ni­tion that the public cared about ju­di­cial in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah pointed out that it would not be ap­pro­pri­ate to com­pare Sin­ga­pore to coun­tries where the At­tor­neys-Gen­eral hold po­lit­i­cal of­fice, and could there­fore be sub­ject to po­lit­i­cal pres­sures.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Con­sti­tu­tion has safe­guards so that the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral does not hold po­lit­i­cal of­fice, and can dis­charge both sets of du­ties with­out fear or favour, she ex­plained.</p>
    <p>While both sides of the House did not reach agree­ment, Ms In­dra­nee wel­comed the de­bate, say­ing what drove it was the de­sire to im­prove the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>3 MIN­IMIS­ING</p>
    <p>LAPSES</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam stressed that there can be no ex­cuse for the gap of five weeks be­tween the po­lice re­port be­ing filed and when po­lice of­fers vis­ited the scene. This was a clear breach of pro­to­col. That said, the in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer ap­peared to be un­der a great deal of work and per­sonal pres­sure.</p>
    <p>To put things in per­spec­tive, he said, the ra­tio of po­lice of­fi­cers to the pop­u­la­tion here is 0.23 per cent com­pared with 0.42 per cent in New York. Another</p>
    <p>11,000 pairs of boots on the ground would be needed just to level up with New York.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral MPs also raised the op­tion of video record­ings – some­thing he called the “gold stan­dard”.</p>
    <p>But tech­nol­ogy and re­source con­straints – such as hav­ing to get more tran­scribers on board – re­main a bot­tle­neck, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) and Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC) sug­gested greater in­ter­ven­tion by the AGC at an early stage, and in­volv­ing more judges both at the start as well as the ap­peals stage.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem, said the min­is­ter, was that not all cases are cut and dried. Some start off as sim­ple but end up be­ing com­plex.</p>
    <p>4 BET­TER</p>
    <p>LE­GAL AC­CESS FOR THE DIS­AD­VAN­TAGED</p>
    <p>In her no­tice of mo­tion for de­bate, WP chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) said the ju­di­cial sys­tem’s heavy re­liance on money-bail dis­ad­van­tages the less well-off, who may end up spend­ing a longer time in re­mand. Also, could the au­thor­i­ties al­low in­stal­ment pay­ments of fines to pre­vent them from snow­balling?</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the dif­fi­culty lies in iden­ti­fy­ing who gen­uinely can­not af­ford the fines. But the po­lice have been di­rected to look into how in­stal­ments might work.</p>
    <p>He also gave his in-prin­ci­ple sup­port to set­ting up a Public De­fender’s Of­fice, which helps the poor in le­gal mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Again, the is­sue is one of re­sources: How can it be sus­tain­ably funded, given that sim­i­lar out­fits else­where have proven to be fis­cally drain­ing? Also, what hap­pens when lawyers baulk at the low fees and do not come for­ward, and cases fail to make it to the courts?</p>
    <p>He made clear yes­ter­day that there was no ques­tion of re­open­ing the Parti Liyani case as the High Court de­ci­sion is fi­nal. What is more im­por­tant is to move on con­struc­tively.</p>
    <p>There are no card­board he­roes or vil­lains in this episode. More fun­da­men­tally, whether one agrees or dis­agrees with the court’s con­clu­sions, all are equal be­fore the law.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment that Mr Liew’s son, Karl, will be charged for fur­nish­ing false in­for­ma­tion and giv­ing false ev­i­dence in court, is a clear case in point. “The cred­i­bil­ity of our sys­tem, the foun­da­tion of our so­ci­ety, de­pends on us en­sur­ing that there is rule of law and that the law ap­plies equally to all,” said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>“If that prin­ci­ple is com­pro­mised, then Sin­ga­pore is com­pro­mised. It is a ba­sic duty of the Gov­ern­ment to en­sure that that prin­ci­ple is up­held.”</p>
    <p>The mes­sage is sim­ply this: It does not mat­ter who you are. If you do wrong, ac­tion will be taken. As Amer­i­can civil rights ac­tivist Martin Luther King Jr said: “The arc of the moral uni­verse is long, but it bends to­wards jus­tice”.</p>
