    <p>SEOUL North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to strengthen his nu­clear-armed na­tion’s mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties at a key rul­ing party meet­ing, state me­dia re­ported yes­ter­day, just weeks be­fore Mr Joe Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion as United States pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In his work re­port to the Work­ers’ Party congress, Mr Kim pledged to place “the state de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties on a much higher level, and put forth goals for re­al­is­ing it”, the of­fi­cial Korean Cen­tral News Agency (KCNA) said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an initial war of words and mu­tual threats, out­go­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had an ex­tra­or­di­nary diplo­matic bro­mance with Mr Kim, fea­tur­ing head­line-grab­bing meet­ings and dec­la­ra­tions of love by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>But talks between Wash­ing­ton and Py­ongyang have stalled since the two men’s sec­ond sum­mit in Hanoi broke down in Fe­bru­ary 2019 over sanc­tions re­lief and what North Korea would be will­ing to give up in re­turn.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the North is us­ing the five-yearly congress to send the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion a mes­sage, but is tread­ing care­fully – Mr Bi­den char­ac­terised Mr Kim as a “thug” dur­ing the pres­i­den­tial de­bates, while Py­ongyang has pre­vi­ously called Mr Bi­den a “ra­bid dog”.</p>
    <p>KCNA did not re­fer to nu­clear weapons in its re­port or give spe­cific de­tails of Mr Kim’s goals.</p>
    <p>But North Korean de­fec­tor turned re­searcher Ahn Chan-il of the World In­sti­tute for North Korea Stud­ies in Seoul told Agence France-Presse: “It ba­si­cally means the North will strengthen its nu­clear ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Kim does not want to say the word ‘nu­clear’ as Bi­den takes of­fice later this month, and he knows the in­com­ing pres­i­dent’s stance on Py­ongyang is un­com­pro­mis­ing com­pared with his pre­de­ces­sor.”</p>
    <p>The US is ex­pected to re­turn to more ortho­dox diplo­matic ap­proaches un­der Mr Bi­den, such as in­sist­ing on ex­ten­sive progress at work­ing-level talks be­fore any lead­ers’ sum­mit can be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>North Korea says it needs nu­clear weapons to de­fend it­self against a pos­si­ble US in­va­sion, and for decades has poured vast amounts of re­sources into de­vel­op­ing them.</p>
