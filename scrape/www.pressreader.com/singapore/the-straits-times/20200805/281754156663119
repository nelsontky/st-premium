    <p>Ms Aras­mani Devi, 36, plucks out a nee­dle from a used sy­ringe with her bare hands, be­fore throw­ing its plas­tic bar­rel and plunger into a sack of po­ten­tially re­cy­clable items.</p>
    <p>Her 40-year-old hus­band Akhilesh Paswan works next to her at a re­cy­cling yard in Noida, a sub­urb near Delhi. “These days, we find more masks and gloves in the waste,” he said, pick­ing up a dirty set of plas­tic gloves with his bare hands.</p>
    <p>Cows and dogs scav­eng­ing in the back­ground for po­ten­tial treats sud­denly dis­perse as an­other waste picker chases them away.</p>
    <p>“We are scared of the coro­n­avirus, but we came here two months back and took up this work as we could barely sur­vive back home,” added Mr Paswan, who is from the state of Bi­har.</p>
    <p>Waste pick­ers like them to­day face an in­creas­ing di­rect risk from a spike in bio­med­i­cal waste in In­dia be­cause of the coro­n­avirus out­break. From al­most 609 met­ric tonnes of daily bio­med­i­cal waste gen­er­a­tion in 2018, In­dia now gen­er­ates 710 tonnes daily, in­clud­ing 101 tonnes of Covid-19-re­lated waste.</p>
    <p>This lat­est avail­able gov­ern­ment fig­ure was recorded at the end of May and is likely to have gone up, given the in­crease in the num­ber of Covid-19 cases since then. In­dia yes­ter­day recorded a to­tal of more than 1.85 mil­lion cases, with 38,938 deaths caused by the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The surge in bio­med­i­cal waste could soon over­whelm In­dia’s in­stalled ca­pac­ity to treat it, which is around 840 tonnes daily and spread over more than 195 com­mon bio­med­i­cal waste treat­ment fa­cil­i­ties (CBWTFs). Poor seg­re­ga­tion of bio­med­i­cal waste from solid mu­nic­i­pal waste, which also ends up at these fa­cil­i­ties, threat­ens to fur­ther has­ten this process.</p>
    <p>Bio­med­i­cal waste from health­care fa­cil­i­ties and lab­o­ra­to­ries is col­lected by au­tho­rised agents and sent to CBWTFs for incin­er­a­tion. While this process has worked rel­a­tively well through the pan­demic, vast amounts of bio­med­i­cal waste have also been gen­er­ated from house­holds, in­clud­ing from Covid-19 pa­tients un­der home iso­la­tion and gen­eral house­holds with po­ten­tially asymp­to­matic and un­di­ag­nosed cases.</p>
    <p>This has brought to the fore a chronic fail­ure in In­dia’s waste man­age­ment – poor seg­re­ga­tion of waste in In­dian house­holds and a lack of en­force­ment of this prac­tice by ur­ban lo­cal bod­ies. This has re­sulted in bio­med­i­cal waste mix­ing with mu­nic­i­pal waste and reach­ing dump yards and land­fills, pos­ing a health risk to an es­ti­mated four mil­lion waste pick­ers in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Im­proper dis­posal of bio­med­i­cal waste can lead to ad­verse health and en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pacts, in­clud­ing the re­lease of chem­i­cal or bi­o­log­i­cal haz­ards such as drug-re­sis­tant mi­cro-or­gan­isms, said the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>A July 27 re­port from the En­vi­ron­ment Pol­lu­tion (Preven­tion and Con­trol) Au­thor­ity said bio­med­i­cal waste be­ing gen­er­ated in house­holds presents a “key com­pli­ca­tion”, as ur­ban lo­cal bod­ies and vil­lage coun­cils will have to track pa­tients on a real-time ba­sis and set up sys­tems for col­lec­tion of bio­med­i­cal waste from in­di­vid­ual house­holds.</p>
    <p>The lat­est guide­lines from the Cen­tral Pol­lu­tion Con­trol Board spec­ify that masks, gloves and tis­sues or swabs from Covid-19 pa­tients un­der home iso­la­tion have to be col­lected sep­a­rately and treated as bio­med­i­cal waste and sent to a CBWTF.</p>
    <p>They even added that gen­eral house­holds should cut masks and gloves to pre­vent re­use and keep them in a pa­per bag for a min­i­mum of 72 hours prior to dis­posal as gen­eral mu­nic­i­pal waste.</p>
    <p>But these guide­lines are be­ing flouted, with some pe­ti­tions filed in courts and the Na­tional Green Tri­bunal even claim­ing that Covid-19 waste is be­ing dumped care­lessly in the open, in­clud­ing in dump­ing grounds.</p>
    <p>“In­dia has some very pro­gres­sive waste man­age­ment rules, but there is no point in hav­ing these ex­tremely good rules if they are not im­ple­mented on the ground,” Ms Chi­tra Mukher­jee, head of ad­vo­cacy and pol­icy at Chin­tan – a not­for-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that works on en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity and so­cial jus­tice is­sues – told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Dinesh Raj Ban­dela, a deputy pro­gramme man­ager for mu­nic­i­pal solid waste at the Cen­tre for Sci­ence and En­vi­ron­ment, vis­ited a neigh­bour­hood in north-west Delhi in June to track the col­lec­tion of waste from some Covid-19af­fected house­holds.</p>
    <p>While waste from such house­holds was be­ing col­lected sep­a­rately, it was not seg­re­gated, and bio­med­i­cal waste came mixed with solid mu­nic­i­pal waste, he told ST.</p>
    <p>“All this fi­nally ended up in a land­fill,” Mr Ban­dela said. “There is very poor knowl­edge among the public on how to han­dle Covid-re­lated waste and the gov­ern­ment has done lit­tle to build aware­ness,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Mukher­jee pointed out that the fo­cus should not just be on seg­re­ga­tion but also on re­duc­tion of bio­med­i­cal waste. “If you have less waste to man­age, you will han­dle it bet­ter,” she said, adding that the gen­eral public needs to be en­cour­aged to use re­us­able cloth masks.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tral Pol­lu­tion Con­trol Board has asked for the CBWTFs to op­er­ate ex­tra hours and even per­mit­ted the use of com­mon haz­ardous waste and in­dus­trial cap­tive in­cin­er­a­tors to burn bio­med­i­cal waste.</p>
    <p>There have been sug­ges­tions to set up more CBWTFs, but Ms Mukher­jee said this is not an ideal so­lu­tion given how sim­i­lar in­cin­er­a­tors such as waste-to-en­ergy plants have been poorly mon­i­tored, in­clud­ing for lev­els and types of harm­ful emis­sions they re­lease while in­cin­er­at­ing waste.</p>
    <p>“With the pan­demic get­ting worse day by day – every day there is a new spike – is the an­swer re­ally build­ing more and more CBWTFs, know­ing that in In­dia we do not have a his­tory of mon­i­tor­ing sim­i­lar in­cin­er­a­tors?” she added.</p>
