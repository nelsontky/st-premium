    <p>A team of four stu­dents from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) Col­lege East have raised about $86,000 for their peers who have been af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They achieved this by pro­duc­ing a video show­cas­ing heart­felt sto­ries of fel­low stu­dents who have been strug­gling dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>One of them is 23-year-old Ah­mad (not his real name), whose mother lost her job dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year. To sup­port her, Ah­mad took on a part-time po­si­tion as a cleaner at a Covid-19 com­mu­nity re­cov­ery fa­cil­ity mainly for mi­grant work­ers, earn­ing about $2,600 a month.</p>
    <p>Four other stu­dents’ sto­ries were also fea­tured.</p>
    <p>The team be­hind the video – Ms Ch­eryl Oon Siew Ying, 18, Mr Danish Sufi Usyair, 18, Ms Dela Cruz Tr­isha Mae Guz­man, 19, and Ms Margie Ybanez, 20 – had taken part in this year’s Youth for Causes (YFC) fund-raiser jointly or­gan­ised by Citi Foun­da­tion and YMCA of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>VALU­ABLE LESSONS</p>
    <p>YFC’s vir­tual awards cel­e­bra­tion was held last Fri­day and at­tended by Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong and other guests.</p>
    <p>The YFC pro­gramme pro­motes so­cial en­trepreneur­ship and com­mu­nity lead­er­ship de­vel­op­ment</p>
    <p>among youth.</p>
    <p>This year, 316 young peo­ple across 79 teams par­tic­i­pated. Teams were each given a seed fund­ing of $1,600 to help a vol­un­tary wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tion of their choice.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, over $450,000 was raised for 36 so­cial ser­vice agen­cies that tackle is­sues such as men­tal well­ness, spe­cial needs, lesspriv­i­leged youth and en­vi­ron­men­tal con­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>In a speech at the vir­tual event, Mr Wong praised the par­tic­i­pants for putting aside their per­sonal chal­lenges amid the Covid-19 cri­sis and stepping up to help oth­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “When we serve, we meet peo­ple in cir­cum­stances dif­fer­ent from our own; we de­velop greater em­pa­thy and we learn what it means to walk in the shoes of oth­ers. We de­velop a stronger sense of duty and re­spon­si­bil­ity for our fel­low cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>“This binds us, and this is what makes us a com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>The video by the ITE stu­dents was the top fund-raiser at this year’s YFC. The stu­dents chose to help Bethesda Care Ser­vices, which mainly serves the eastern part of Sin­ga­pore and col­lab­o­rates with ITE for youth outreach pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Funds raised will go to­wards these pro­grammes, as well as study</p>
    <p>grants for stu­dents whose fam­i­lies were af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ITE stu­dents posted their video on plat­forms such as YouTube and In­sta­gram. View­ers were di­rected to a Giv­ing.sg fundrais­ing page, where a to­tal of $21,590 was raised.</p>
    <p>Ms Ybanez, the team’s leader, said the team also sent e-mails to sev­eral com­pa­nies, rais­ing an­other $20,000 in cor­po­rate do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>With the seed fund­ing, as well as dol­lar-for-dol­lar match­ing by the Govern­ment, the to­tal do­na­tions added up to about $86,000.</p>
    <p>Ms Ybanez said it was chal­leng­ing to find stu­dents who were will­ing to open up on cam­era, and the in­ter­vie­wees needed a lot of per­sua­sion and en­cour­age­ment.</p>
    <p>She added: “We learnt a lot from this ex­pe­ri­ence... We learnt that some peo­ple need more en­cour­age­ment than they do fi­nan­cial help. We saw peo­ple who needed a lis­ten­ing ear, and also, we dis­cov­ered that there are many peo­ple out there who are com­pas­sion­ate and will­ing to help those in need.”</p>
