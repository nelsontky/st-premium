    <p>There were 12 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, and for the third day in a row, all were im­ported cases, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) last night.</p>
    <p>All were placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>They com­prise one Sin­ga­porean, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), three work pass hold­ers, two work per­mit hold­ers, three de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and one long-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is a 19-year-old woman who re­turned from France.</p>
    <p>The two PRs ar­rived from the United States and In­dia.</p>
    <p>Of the five em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, three are work pass hold­ers who re­turned from the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE), Bos­nia and Herze­gov­ina, and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>One of the work pass hold­ers, a 49-year-old In­dian na­tional trav­el­ling from the UAE, was a con­tact of a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>The two work per­mit hold­ers trav­elled from In­done­sia and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>An­other three cases are de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from Russia, France and the UAE.</p>
    <p>One of them, a 46-year-old In­dian na­tional who trav­elled from the UAE, was a con­tact of a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing case is a longterm visit pass holder who trav­elled from the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>All 12 cases, of which one was symp­to­matic, tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,114.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced the clus­ter in PPT Lodge 1A has been closed as no new cases were linked to it for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with one case in the past week, which is un­linked, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>With six cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,993 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 50 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 28 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
