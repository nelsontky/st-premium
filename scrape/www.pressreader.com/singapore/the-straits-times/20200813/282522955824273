    <p>The Amer­i­can hor­ror writer H.P. Love­craft (1890-1937) was fa­mously a rag­ing racist, his books, fic­tional mon­sters and pri­vate writ­ings all dis­play­ing a thinly veiled dis­gust to­wards peo­ple of colour.</p>
    <p>A few Love­craftian mon­sters pop up in the new su­per­nat­u­ral se­ries,</p>
    <p>Love­craft Coun­try, a term used to re­fer to the New Eng­land set­ting of many of his sto­ries. But the point of the show is that the real mon­ster is racism.</p>
    <p>Granted, it is not the most sub­tle point, and yet the se­ries – also a char­ac­ter drama and love story – is a joy­ous, cathar­tic romp, with stand­out per­for­mances by stars Jonathan Ma­jors and Jurnee Smol­lett, sump­tu­ous pro­duc­tion de­sign and an in­spired sound­track.</p>
    <p>The story fol­lows Korean War vet­eran At­ti­cus (Ma­jors), his book­ish un­cle Ge­orge (Court­ney B. Vance) and child­hood friend Leti (Smol­lett) as they take a road trip across 1950s, seg­re­ga­tion-era Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>At­ti­cus is search­ing for his miss­ing fa­ther, Mon­trose (Michael Ken­neth Wil­liams), which leads the trio through parts of Mas­sachusetts where be­ing black puts one in grave dan­ger.</p>
    <p>But on top of the hu­man mon­sters they en­counter – the sort who’d hap­pily put a bul­let through their heads for speed­ing or break­ing cur­few – there are spec­tac­u­lar hor­ror-movie mon­sters.</p>
    <p>There is also a band of wealthy white oc­cultists who want to get their hands on At­ti­cus be­cause he is the off­spring of their founder, who im­preg­nated one of his slaves.</p>
    <p>Based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Matt Ruff, the show is cre­ated by Misha Green, who made the slav­ery drama Un­der­ground (2016 to 2017), and co-pro­duced by Jor­dan Peele.</p>
    <p>View­ers will see echoes of Peele’s 2017 film Get Out, which also jux­ta­posed racist and su­per­nat­u­ral hor­rors.</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, is more of a valen­tine to the hor­ror genre it­self, al­though the se­ries is a bit too ea­ger to cross off one trope af­ter an­other, from haunted houses to var­i­ous mon­sters and en­chant­ments.</p>
    <p>Yet it seam­lessly knits this with the very real fear that comes with be­ing a de­hu­man­ised mi­nor­ity, as in a mem­o­rable scene where the trio sit down in a diner only to re­alise, be­lat­edly, that they are not at all wel­come.</p>
    <p>Some of the most pow­er­ful mo­ments hap­pen when the two hor­rors col­lide like in a kaiju mon­ster movie, and the su­per­nat­u­ral nasties turn on the racist op­pres­sors.</p>
    <p>This, no doubt, is a big rea­son At­ti­cus is a hor­ror and science-fic­tion fan: to find es­cape from the real world, and a piti­less jus­tice too of­ten ab­sent from it.</p>
    <p>At a mo­ment in his­tory when the legacy of seg­re­ga­tion re­mains glar­ingly, painfully un­re­solved in the United States, it speaks vol­umes that this es­cape and cathar­sis still feel so nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>In the drama The Nest, a well-heeled Bri­tish cou­ple who seems to have it all take a gam­ble to ob­tain the one thing they don’t have: a child.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a se­ries of mis­car­riages and failed fer­til­ity pro­ce­dures,</p>
    <p>Emily (So­phie Run­dle) and</p>
    <p>Dan (Martin Comp­ston) de­cide to im­plant their last em­bryo in 18-year-old Kaya (Mir­ren Mack).</p>
    <p>There are a few is­sues, of course. Pay­ing for the sur­ro­gacy it­self is il­le­gal in Bri­tain – cou­ples can only cover the sur­ro­gate’s ex­penses, or up to £15,000 (S$27,000).</p>
    <p>But Kaya man­ages to bar­gain for more than three times that and soon in­serts her­self into their life and home.</p>
    <p>Fac­tor in her trou­bled, murky past and you are not sure whether to be­lieve her when she says she is not do­ing this just for the money, but out of a de­sire for a higher pur­pose and fresh start.</p>
    <p>Or when she starts do­ing things like com­ing home drunk and bran­dish­ing a knife in Dan’s face, all while preg­nant.</p>
    <p>It is the clas­sic “be careful what you wish for” sce­nario and fol­lows the tem­plate of other thrillers re­volv­ing around ques­tion­able ad­di­tions to one’s house­hold.</p>
    <p>But in the three episodes pro­vided for re­view – there are five in all – the drama also slips in sneaky ob­ser­va­tions about the class and power dy­nam­ics among Kaya, Emily and Dan, which are riv­et­ing.</p>
    <p>And it makes you start to won­der who is re­ally ex­ploit­ing whom.</p>
