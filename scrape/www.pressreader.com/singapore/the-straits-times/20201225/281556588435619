    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try re­bounded last month, partly be­cause the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal seg­ment grasped the op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated by the Covid-19 out­break. Fac­tory out­put beat an­a­lyst ex­pec­ta­tions and ex­panded</p>
    <p>17.9 per cent year on year, re­vers­ing the 0.8 per cent de­cline seen the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>As a year weighed down by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic drew to a close, Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try re­bounded last month, partly be­cause the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal seg­ment grasped the op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated by the out­break.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tors also turned in a strong per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Repub­lic weath­er­ing its worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence, man­u­fac­tur­ing has been a rare pic­ture of re­silience this year, and is rid­ing the de­mand aris­ing from the pan­demic and 5G mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Fac­tory out­put beat an­a­lysts’ ex­pec­ta­tions and ex­panded 17.9 per cent year on year, re­vers­ing the 0.8 per cent de­cline seen the pre­vi­ous month, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Economists polled by Bloomberg had fore­cast a 14.1 per cent jump.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the sec­tor is likely to end the year on a pos­i­tive note, with over 6 per cent growth.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin said the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor has been “re­mark­ably re­silient” this year, un­like pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions, where it had been a ma­jor ca­su­alty.</p>
    <p>It is likely to con­tinue the third quar­ter’s 2 per cent growth into the fourth quar­ter, he added.</p>
    <p>The volatile bio­med­i­cal clus­ter, which has been one of the best­per­form­ing this year, recorded a 40.6 per cent jump in out­put last month com­pared with the same pe­riod a year ago, with the pan­demic con­tin­u­ing to drive de­mand for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and med­i­cal equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, said: “Bio­med­i­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing is def­i­nitely the shin­ing star for now, with the pan­demic driv­ing global de­mand for test kits, vac­cines and other re­lated para­pher­na­lia in the short term.”</p>
    <p>The phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals seg­ment surged 50.8 per cent last month, on the back of higher pro­duc­tion of ac­tive phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­gre­di­ents and bi­o­log­i­cal prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy seg­ment also went up, by 22.7 per cent, due to higher ex­port de­mand for med­i­cal de­vices. Sin­ga­pore pro­duces a range of med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy prod­ucts such as im­plantable pace­mak­ers and con­tact lenses.</p>
    <p>The bio­med­i­cal clus­ter has ex­panded 26.1 per cent year on year be­tween Jan­uary and last month.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua said that with con­tin­ued strong de­mand for vac­cines in the com­ing year and Sin­ga­pore’s pos­si­ble role in pro­duc­ing them, the pharma seg­ment could see sus­tained growth.</p>
    <p>The key elec­tron­ics sec­tor surged 34.9 per cent year on year last month, with all seg­ments record­ing growth in out­put, apart from in­fo­comms and con­sumer elec­tron­ics. In par­tic­u­lar, the semi­con­duc­tor seg­ment ex­panded by 40.9 per cent on the back of de­mand from 5G mar­kets and a low pro­duc­tion base a year ago.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the trans­port en­gi­neer­ing clus­ter saw a con­trac­tion in out­put.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling noted that the man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try is likely to see low sin­gle-digit growth in the com­ing year. “Go­ing into 2021, given that the sec­tor had ex­panded 6.5 per cent for the first 11 months of the year, it may be re­al­is­tic to ex­pect some mod­er­a­tion in growth mo­men­tum.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Dr Chua said: “Given the man­u­fac­tur­ing growth this year, re­cov­ery in 2021 would have to be more de­pen­dent on the ser­vice sec­tor, which will, in turn, de­pend on vac­ci­na­tions and the lift­ing of travel re­stric­tions.”</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Cryp­tocur­rency XRP crashed on Wed­nes­day af­ter the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion (SEC) charged as­so­ci­ated blockchain firm Rip­ple with con­duct­ing a US$1.3 bil­lion (S$1.7 bil­lion) un­reg­is­tered se­cu­ri­ties of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>XRP, the third-big­gest cryp­tocur­rency by mar­ket value, plunged al­most 40 per cent to about 26 US cents, bring­ing its to­tal weekly losses to more than 50 per cent and wip­ing out around US$10 bil­lion in mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>The SEC main­tains that Rip­ple’s chair­man, co-founder and former chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Chris­tian Larsen and cur­rent CEO Brad Gar­ling­house “failed to reg­is­ter their of­fers and sales of XRP or sat­isfy any ex­emp­tion from reg­is­tra­tion”.</p>
    <p>The two also or­ches­trated per­sonal un­reg­is­tered sales worth US$600 mil­lion, the SEC al­leged.</p>
    <p>Rip­ple has re­jected the charges, say­ing XRP is a cur­rency and does not need to be reg­is­tered as an in­vest­ment con­tract.</p>
    <p>Mr Gar­ling­house called the case “an as­sault on crypto at large” in a mes­sage to staff that was posted on the com­pany’s blog. The SEC did not want to foster in­no­va­tion in the dig­i­tal as­set space, he said.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tors around the globe are still grap­pling with how to reg­u­late bit­coin, XRP and ri­val cryp­tocur­ren­cies. Mar­kets are watch­ing closely for reg­u­la­tory de­vel­op­ments that could de­ter­mine whether cryp­tocur­ren­cies make the leap from a niche to a main­stream as­set.</p>
    <p>XRP, which of­ten moves in tan­dem with bit­coin, had rock­eted last month to hit its high­est level since 2018 as a rally in cryp­tocur­ren­cies gath­ered pace.</p>
    <p>The Bit­wise 10 Crypto In­dex Fund (BITW) – which has surged nearly 180 per cent since its Dec 9 launch – liq­ui­dated its po­si­tion in XRP, which com­prised 3.8 per cent of its hold­ings, ac­cord­ing to a Wed­nes­day state­ment.</p>
    <p>Not only is Rip­ple in “hot wa­ter” and un­likely to beat the SEC’s law­suit, but XRP may also be­come harder to trade and trans­act in should US mar­ket­places be un­will­ing to list it, ac­cord­ing to a Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence (BI) re­port.</p>
    <p>“At stake in the Dec 22 suit may be the abil­ity to trade XRP and more than a bil­lion dol­lars, though set­tle­ment for a frac­tion of that is also pos­si­ble,” wrote BI an­a­lysts El­liot Stein and Ben El­liott.</p>
    <p>“Rip­ple also risks a court rul­ing that XRP is a se­cu­rity, which would sub­ject it to stricter SEC rules that may curb transactio­ns as US vir­tual mar­ket­places may be re­luc­tant to list XRP due to the risk of fa­cil­i­tat­ing the sale of a po­ten­tially un­reg­is­tered se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Un­like bit­coin or ether – which the SEC con­sid­ers as cur­ren­cies and are de­cen­tralised – XRP’s value was mainly linked to Rip­ple prod­ucts, with the firm at­tempt­ing to in­flu­ence sup­ply and de­mand for the to­ken, the an­a­lysts wrote.</p>
    <p>Though bit­coin – the largest hold­ing in BITW – held on to slight gains, the fund dropped roughly 9.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>At least one dig­i­tal-as­set trad­ing plat­form has moved to delist XRP in the wake of the SEC suit.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong-based OSL said it has sus­pended trad­ing in the cryp­tocur­rency.</p>
    <p>The SEC said in July 2017 that com­pa­nies rais­ing money through the sale of dig­i­tal as­sets must ad­here to fed­eral se­cu­ri­ties laws.</p>
    <p>BI ex­pects Rip­ple to an­swer the agency’s com­plaint in the next quar­ter, and that a de­ci­sion could come in early 2022.</p>
