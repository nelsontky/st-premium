    <p>Court action is un­der way to force em­bat­tled oil ty­coon Lim Oon Kuin and his two chil­dren to re­pay US$3.5 bil­lion (S$4.8 bil­lion) in debt and $90 mil­lion in div­i­dends that they al­legedly paid them­selves even though their com­pany was in­sol­vent. The le­gal action has been in­sti­gated by Price­wa­ter­house­C­oop­ers Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices, the ju­di­cial man­ager of the in­sol­vent com­pany, Hin Leong Trad­ing.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times show that ju­di­cial man­agers Goh Thien Phong and Chan Kheng Tek have ac­cused Lim, his son Evan Lim Chee Meng and his daugh­ter Lim Huey Ching of fraud­u­lent trad­ing and breach­ing their fidu­ciary du­ties as di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>They were ac­cused of “de­lib­er­ately con­ceal­ing (Hin Leong’s) losses and por­tray­ing it as a prof­itable com­pany when in fact it was mas­sively in­sol­vent”.</p>
    <p>The al­leged fraud­u­lent ac­tiv­ity in­cluded “the cre­ation of fic­ti­tious gains to con­ceal ac­cu­mu­lated trad­ing and other losses, the forgery of doc­u­ments, the ma­nip­u­la­tion of Hin Leong’s ac­counts through ir­reg­u­lar ac­count­ing en­tries, the over­state­ment of Hin Leong’s in­ven­tory and the ob­tain­ing of financing through im­proper means”.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, they pre­sented a “vastly mis­lead­ing pic­ture of its fi­nan­cial health to ex­ter­nal par­ties and de­ceived its lenders into ex­tend­ing financing, even though Hin Leong has been in­sol­vent since the fi­nan­cial year ended Oct 31, 2012”, said PwC, which is rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Cavin­der Bull and Mr Chia Voon Jiet of Drew & Napier.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, the out­stand­ing amount of US$3.5 bil­lion are Hin Leong’s debts, which t he Lim fam­ily are per­son­ally re­spon­si­ble for, with­out lim­i­ta­tion of li­a­bil­ity,” ac­cord­ing to the suit.</p>
    <p>Since Hin Leong was placed un­der in­terim ju­di­cial man­age­ment in April, the Lims have not met its ju­di­cial man­agers to dis­cuss the com­pany’s pro­posed re­struc­tur­ing and have in­stead hired law firm Davin­der Singh Cham­bers to rep­re­sent them.</p>
    <p>Lim Oon Kuin is out on $3 mil­lion bail af­ter be­ing charged on Aug 14 with abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong is now un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the po­lice and in­creased scru­tiny by sev­eral reg­u­la­tors af­ter Lim al­legedly caused US$808.2 mil­lion in losses in­curred from fu­tures and swap trad­ing from 2010 to this year to be hid­den in the firm’s ac­counts.</p>
    <p>In­stead, fic­ti­tious prof­itable swap trades were re­flected in the ac­counts, caus­ing its fi­nan­cial state­ments to be dras­ti­cally mis­stated, the suit said.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said Evan Lim and his sis­ter have been ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tors of Hin Leong for more than 20 years, with Evan han­dling swap trad­ing since at least 2016, while Ms Lim was per­son­ally in charge of the com­pany’s fi­nance and ac­counts de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>The suit said the Lim sib­lings “know­ingly par­tic­i­pated i n the cre­ation of doc­u­ments for 780 fic­ti­tious swap trades with var­i­ous coun­ter­par­ties”. Fur­ther, “as au­tho­rised bank sig­na­to­ries, they au­tho­rised pay­ments by In­ter­net bank­ing or signed bank pay­ment ad­vices for in­ter­bank trans­fers which were dis­guised as pay­ments from coun­ter­par­ties”.</p>
    <p>“Given the mag­ni­tude and ex­tent of the fabri­cated gains and forged doc­u­ments, Evan Lim and (his sis­ter)... ought to have known that fic­ti­tious swap trades were cre­ated to con­ceal Hin Leong’s losses, in­ter­bank trans­fers were ex­e­cuted to give the false ap­pear­ance that pay­ment was re­ceived in re­spect of th­ese swap trades, and that doc­u­ments were forged to sup­port th­ese fic­ti­tious swap trades,” the suit added.</p>
    <p>“By ma­nip­u­lat­ing Hin Leong’s ac­counts, the Lim fam­ily caused its as­sets to be grossly over­stated in its fi­nan­cial state­ments for the 2019 fi­nan­cial year, cre­at­ing a false im­pres­sion that US$2.27 bil­lion worth of ac­counts re­ceiv­ables was re­cov­er­able when it was not,” it said.</p>
    <p>The Lim fam­ily also caused Hin Leong to over­state the bal­ance of its in­ven­tory in its fi­nan­cial state­ments for last year by at least US$809.8 mil­lion. The short­fall re­lates to in­ven­tory on board ves­sels char­tered from its ship­ping arm, Ocean Tankers, and the fam­ily-owned Xihe Group, the suit said.</p>
    <p>It added that the Lim fam­ily also caused Hin Leong to im­prop­erly ob­tain US$623.3 mil­lion in in­ven­tory financing from bank cred­i­tors “by pledg­ing cargo it did not own, over­stat­ing the quan­tity of cargo it did own, and by pledg­ing cargo that had al­ready been en­cum­bered”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the suit, the Lim fam­ily caused Hin Leong to sell each of the car­goes on three ves­sels to more than one party, to en­able them to get “much more financing for Hin Leong than they would have if they had sold each cargo only once”.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, the Lim fam­ily is al­leged to have caused Hin Leong to sub­mit 27 fabri­cated sales con­tracts that were not sup­ported by any gen­uine un­der­ly­ing sale trans­ac­tion. This was done al­legedly to “ob­tain financing from 15 banks by way of 58 let­ter of credit fa­cil­i­ties, two in­voice financing fa­cil­i­ties and one in­ven­tory financing fa­cil­ity”.</p>
    <p>The suit noted that “12 of the 27 sales con­tracts were sub­mit­ted multiple times. The to­tal value of financing ob­tained was US$1.24 bil­lion, of which US$1.15 bil­lion re­mains out­stand­ing as of April 27”.</p>
    <p>KNOW­ING PAR­TIC­I­PA­TION?</p>
    <p>Given the mag­ni­tude and ex­tent of the fabri­cated gains and forged doc­u­ments, Evan Lim and (his sis­ter)... ought to have known that fic­ti­tious swap trades were cre­ated to con­ceal Hin Leong’s losses, in­ter­bank trans­fers were ex­e­cuted to give the false ap­pear­ance that pay­ment was re­ceived in re­spect of th­ese swap trades, and that doc­u­ments were forged to sup­port th­ese ’’ fic­ti­tious swap trades.
