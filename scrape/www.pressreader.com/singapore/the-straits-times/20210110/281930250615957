    <p>Like most adults pur­su­ing a higher ed­u­ca­tion, Ms Sherice Wang, 30, con­tin­ues to do her job while she stud­ies part-time. How­ever, she does not have to rush for evening classes at the end of the work­day.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance mar­ket­ing spe­cial­ist at Sephora South-east Asia’s dig­i­tal arm en­rolled in the Nanyang Pro­fes­sional Master of Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion (PMBA) in July last year as she wanted to gain a bet­ter in­sight into the many facets of busi­ness. The Nanyang PMBA, of­fered by Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) Nanyang Busi­ness School (NBS), would teach her to skil­fully man­age cross­func­tional projects and prime her for a lead­er­ship po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In a typ­i­cal week, Ms Wang gets off work at 6pm, has her din­ner and reaches home by 8pm for self-study. As classes are held on al­ter­nate week­ends in Novena, it is easy for her to in­cor­po­rate snatches of social ac­tiv­i­ties, er­rands and even ex­er­cise in her busy sched­ule.</p>
    <p>She says: “The al­ter­nate week­end class sched­ule al­lows me to com­part­men­talise my timetable and bet­ter man­age my time. In ad­di­tion, my course­mates and I at­tend the same classes to­gether, so we’ve been able to forge deep con­nec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ms Wang also opted for the</p>
    <p>Nanyang PMBA as it can be com­pleted in just 18 months — each mod­ule takes just one to two weeks. A fast-tracked pro­gramme is suited to her e-com­merce mar­ket­ing role, in which changes de­velop rapidly.</p>
    <p>Al­ways some­thing new</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion de­gree holder, who is al­ready fa­mil­iar with ac­count­ing con­cepts, says the mod­ules are well­taught. “There are pre-course quizzes, group projects and in­di­vid­ual ex­ams — I thought I knew enough, but there were al­ways fresh take­aways for me,” she says.</p>
    <p>Ms Wang feels the pro­fes­sors pro­vide suf­fi­cient guid­ance on the pre-course ma­te­rial, so even those with no ac­count­ing or fi­nance back­ground can start on the same foot­ing.</p>
    <p>She adds: “I am in the mar­ket­ing field, but I don’t have a mar­ket­ing de­gree. Af­ter com­plet­ing the mar­ket­ing mod­ule and learn­ing about its pur­pose and im­por­tance, I’m de­ter­mined to con­tinue in my work role.”</p>
    <p>At work, Ms Wang over­sees the Hong Kong and Philip­pine mar­kets. She also takes care of a Face­book Col­lab­o­ra­tive Ad project in the South-east Asia re­gion. She found the Nanyang PMBA’s four-mod­ule Lead­ing People Glob­ally seg­ment es­pe­cially help­ful, as it touches on ne­go­ti­a­tion skills, lead­er­ship, cul­tural in­tel­li­gence and tal­ent man­age­ment — ar­eas that help her have a bet­ter cul­tural un­der­stand­ing of her re­gional clients and cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Ms Wang also has ac­cess to a ca­reer men­tor, who has four decades’ ex­pe­ri­ence in the cor­po­rate world and can pro­vide a fresh per­spec­tive on her ca­reer plan­ning.</p>
    <p>This year, Ms Wang is look­ing for­ward to the Nanyang PMBA’s Strat­egy Projects at Nanyang, in which par­tic­i­pants ap­ply class­room learn­ing to solve real busi­ness chal­lenges; and if the global Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion al­lows, sum­mer pro­grammes abroad. She also has her eye on mod­ules re­lat­ing to cri­sis sce­nar­ios and con­tin­gency plan­ning, as well as emerg­ing mar­ket strate­gies, which she feels will be rel­e­vant to her job.</p>
    <p>“In a world where dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing are key, know­ing the basics will no longer be enough. Data anal­y­sis and cross-func­tional in­no­va­tion will soon be­come more im­por­tant, and I wouldn’t be able to keep up with­out gain­ing the most re­cent and rel­e­vant busi­ness knowl­edge. The Nanyang PMBA gives me a chance to do that,” she says.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the broad-based Nanyang PMBA, NTU’s NBS re­cently launched a new in­ter­na­tional trad­ing track in col­lab­o­ra­tion with En­ter­prise Singapore. Lessons for the first co­hort be­gin in July.</p>
