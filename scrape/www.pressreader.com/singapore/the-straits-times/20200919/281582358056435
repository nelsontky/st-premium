    <p>As the death toll mounts and Covid-19 in­fec­tions cross the 30 mil­lion mark, the search for a way to stop the pan­demic grows ever more in­tense. It has also led to de­bates on eth­i­cal is­sues re­lated to chal­lenge tri­als, says Pro­fes­sor Chong Siow Ann (be­low).</p>
    <p>What we most fear these days is the un­end­ing ram­page of the Covid-19 virus; what we most dream of is de­liv­ery from this or­deal and to have our old life back; and what we most dread is the un­know­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>And who wouldn’t, with 30 mil­lion in­fected, al­most a mil­lion dead and a soul lost ev­ery 15 sec­onds? What we des­per­ately want is a vac­cine that will give us im­mu­nity and make us un­afraid.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine devel­op­ment is com­plex and un­cer­tain – there is still no vac­cine for HIV. Un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, it takes a very long time for a vi­able vac­cine to move from an­i­mal stud­ies to a series of hu­man tri­als to reg­u­la­tory li­cen­sure.</p>
    <p>The hu­man pa­pil­lo­mavirus</p>
    <p>(HPV) vac­cine – which pre­vents HPV-re­lated in­fec­tions and cer­tain can­cers – took 15 years to de­velop, while the chick­en­pox vac­cine took 28 years.</p>
    <p>But there is an un­prece­dented sense of ur­gency that the Covid-19 pan­demic has gen­er­ated. Sci­en­tists in re­search in­sti­tutes and the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try are rac­ing to de­velop an ef­fec­tive vac­cine; al­ready, there are about 150 ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines at var­i­ous stages of devel­op­ment in the pipe­line in­ter­na­tion­ally, of which 40 are in clin­i­cal trial.</p>
    <p>The United States gov­ern­ment has poured money into sev­eral vac­cine can­di­dates through its Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed ini­tia­tive; one that is be­ing devel­oped by the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases and biotech­nol­ogy com­pany Moderna has started re­cruit­ing 30,000 vol­un­teers for what is known as a Phase III, or ef­fi­cacy, trial.</p>
    <p>In this sort of trial, thou­sands of healthy adult vol­un­teers are ran­domly as­signed to two groups: One would re­ceive the ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cine, and the other (called con­trols) will re­ceive a placebo. The par­tic­i­pants do not know what they have re­ceived (a pro­ce­dure known as “blind­ing”).</p>
    <p>They are mon­i­tored for side ef­fects and tested for in­fec­tion that might come their way as they carry on with their reg­u­lar lives (what­ever reg­u­lar would mean at this time). By even­tu­ally com­par­ing the rates of in­fec­tion in these two groups, the ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine can be de­ter­mined.</p>
    <p>Other than need­ing huge num­bers of par­tic­i­pants and time to re­cruit, screen and en­rol them into the study, it is also very dif­fi­cult to pre­dict the end point of the trial, as it is de­pen­dent on the rate of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>If public health mea­sures like wear­ing face masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing are work­ing well, there would be low rates of trans­mis­sion, and it could take a long time for enough par­tic­i­pants to be nat­u­rally in­fected be­fore any mean­ing­ful com­par­isons can be made.</p>
    <p>Amid so much fear, suf­fer­ing and des­per­a­tion, there are many who feel that we can­not af­ford to wait that long in this ex­tend­ing and con­sum­ing catas­tro­phe.</p>
    <p>DES­PER­ATE MEA­SURES</p>
    <p>“Dis­eases des­per­ate grown/By des­per­ate ap­pli­ance are re­lieved”, said King Claudius when faced with a per­ceived threat to his kingdom in Shake­speare’s Ham­let; or to put it more pro­saically: Des­per­ate times call for des­per­ate mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In March, Pro­fes­sor Nir Eyal, a bioethi­cist at Rut­gers Univer­sity, pub­lished a paper with epi­demi­ol­o­gists Marc Lip­sitch of Har­vard Univer­sity and Peter</p>
    <p>Smith of the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine, in The Jour­nal of In­fec­tious Disease.</p>
    <p>The paper pro­posed a “hu­man chal­lenge study” where re­searchers would give healthy par­tic­i­pants the ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine and then in­fect them with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This would ob­vi­ate the un­cer­tain wait for a com­mu­nity-trans­mit­ted in­fec­tion to hap­pen, and thus al­low the trial to be shorter and re­quire far fewer sub­jects.</p>
    <p>They rec­om­mended that vol­un­teers should be healthy and young (from the age groups in which the risk of se­vere disease and death fol­low­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tion is low). And if par­tic­i­pants are re­cruited from hot spots with high trans­mis­sion rates, they fur­ther ar­gued, in­fect­ing them de­lib­er­ately would not im­pose any sig­nif­i­cantly greater risk of ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, they would be quar­an­tined, mon­i­tored closely, and would re­ceive the best avail­able care if they be­came ill.</p>
    <p>But find­ings gleaned from stud­ies on the young and healthy may not be ap­pli­ca­ble to the old and un­healthy.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to that, bioethi­cist-physi­cians Ju­lian Savulescu and Do­minic Wilkin­son of the Univer­sity of Ox­ford have pro­posed – un­sen­ti­men­tally and tren­chantly – that el­derly res­i­dents in nurs­ing homes should be given an op­por­tu­nity to par­tic­i­pate in such chal­lenge stud­ies as long as they are men­tally fit to know what they are do­ing, whether out of purely al­tru­is­tic mo­tives; or out of self-in­ter­est from fear of con­tract­ing the virus and want­ing early ac­cess to a vac­cine; or out of an old per­son’s re­signed fa­tal­ism of not car­ing if they die sooner.</p>
    <p>The un­der­ly­ing eth­i­cal prin­ci­ple of chal­lenge stud­ies is founded on English moral philoso­pher Jeremy Ben­tham’s doc­trine of util­i­tar­i­an­ism, which es­pouses that the right thing (or “the high­est prin­ci­ple of moral­ity”) is to do what­ever max­imises util­ity – and “util­ity” means what­ever pro­duces hap­pi­ness, and what­ever pre­vents pain or suf­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>To frame it in the con­text of chal­lenge stud­ies: The num­ber of lives risked (and pos­si­bly lost) would be jus­ti­fied as the po­ten­tial num­ber of lives saved would be far greater. Fur­ther, it could help end the cur­rent global pan­demic faster, along with all that ter­ri­ble strain to health­care and economies.</p>
    <p>But the no­tion of us­ing hu­mans as a means to an end by de­lib­er­ately in­fect­ing them with a harm­ful pathogen is trou­bling.</p>
    <p>Chal­lenge stud­ies have been done pre­vi­ously, in­clud­ing in test­ing vac­cines for dis­eases such as cholera and malaria. But in those cases, there are proven drugs which can help res­cue study par­tic­i­pants if the vac­cine doesn’t work and the par­tic­i­pants be­come sick.</p>
    <p>Therein lies one of the eth­i­cal prob­lems with a Covid-19 chal­lenge study – there is cur­rently no good treat­ment for the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Eyal and his co-au­thors have em­pha­sised that “mul­ti­ple mea­sures would be put in place to en­sure that, prior to con­sent­ing, po­ten­tial par­tic­i­pants fully com­pre­hend the un­usual risks in­volved in the study”.</p>
    <p>In­formed con­sent is one of the core tenets of med­i­cal re­search. The con­sent must be vol­un­tar­ily given, and prospec­tive par­tic­i­pants must un­der­stand what is be­ing asked of them and what could hap­pen to them – that is, they must be fully in­formed of the na­ture of the study, the pro­ce­dures that would be ad­min­is­tered, the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits (if any) and the risks, as well as any com­pen­sa­tion re­sult­ing from any harm.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have pointed out that par­tic­i­pants for any chal­lenge study for a Covid-19 vac­cine can­not be fully in­formed about the risks be­cause too lit­tle is known about this new virus.</p>
    <p>There are still too many un­cer­tain­ties and, although it is not com­mon, healthy young peo­ple have be­come crit­i­cally ill and some have died. The long-term se­que­lae are also un­known.</p>
    <p>PER­ILS OF IN­DIF­FER­ENCE</p>
    <p>De­spite these risks, there has been a col­lec­tive yet in­di­vid­u­al­is­tic re­sponse to this cri­sis. A non-profit group called 1Day Sooner (so named be­cause it has been es­ti­mated that speed­ing up vac­cine devel­op­ment by one day would save 1,250 lives) has, to date, signed up more than 37,500 vol­un­teers from 162 coun­tries for such Covid-19 chal­lenge stud­ies.</p>
    <p>But con­sider too an­other en­tirely dif­fer­ent set of re­ac­tions – in the ear­lier part of the year when the pan­demic was al­ready, and ob­vi­ously, rolling un­stop­ping through­out the world, we were shown im­ages of young men and women par­ty­ing on the beaches of Aus­tralia, Texas and Florida de­spite the plain­tive pleas of public health of­fi­cials that they should take so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to pro­tect not just them­selves but other more vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple.</p>
    <p>A BBC pro­gramme showed stu­dents in Mi­ami bent on cel­e­brat­ing their spring break. “If I get corona, I get corona,” said one stu­dent. “At the end of the day, I’m not go­ing to let it stop me from par­ty­ing.”</p>
    <p>Although there is no moral com­par­i­son, those im­ages made me think of a speech that Holo­caust sur­vivor and No­bel lau­re­ate Elie Wiesel gave in the White House in 1999 ti­tled Per­ils of In­dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“Can one pos­si­bly view in­dif­fer­ence as a virtue? Is it nec­es­sary at times to prac­tise it sim­ply to keep one’s san­ity, live nor­mally, en­joy a fine meal and a glass of wine, as the world around us ex­pe­ri­ences har­row­ing up­heavals?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“Of course, in­dif­fer­ence can be tempt­ing – more than that, se­duc­tive,” he con­tin­ued. “It is so much eas­ier to look away from vic­tims. It is so much eas­ier to avoid such rude in­ter­rup­tions to our work, our dreams, our hopes... In­dif­fer­ence re­duces the other to an ab­strac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Leav­en­ing this dispir­it­ing reck­less in­dif­fer­ence are the tens of thou­sands of young peo­ple who have signed up with 1Day Sooner – they are any­thing but in­dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Whether there will be hu­man chal­lenge stud­ies for Covid-19 vac­cines or not, that there are many young peo­ple who would put them­selves in harm’s way for the sake of oth­ers, and in such a time when self-preser­va­tion is the in­stinc­tive re­sponse of most peo­ple, it is some­thing glad­den­ing, brac­ing and ed­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>This pan­demic has re­vealed our fright­ened help­less­ness, our cal­lous dis­re­gard of oth­ers, our ig­no­rant bravado, but also our re­silience, our in­ge­nu­ity, our hero­ism and self­less­ness.</p>
