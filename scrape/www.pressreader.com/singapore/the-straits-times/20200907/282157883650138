    <p>This is the seventh in The Straits Times se­ries by Se­nior Law Cor­re­spon­dent K.C. Vi­jayan on le­gal is­sues, with each edi­tion tied to a spe­cific area of law. To­day’s ar­ti­cles, themed on neg­li­gence and the duty of care, look at ma­jor and mi­nor law­suits, in­clud­ing an al­leged botched med­i­cal op­er­a­tion and a slip-and-fall case.</p>
    <p>A woman is seek­ing dam­ages from a neu­ro­sur­geon for al­legedly op­er­at­ing on the wrong level of her spinal cord to re­move a tu­mour.</p>
    <p>Ms Va­len­cia Zu­niga Va­le­ria El­iz­a­beth, 47, also named two other spe­cial­ists as de­fen­dants, claim­ing breach of duty of care and neg­li­gence in re­la­tion to their treat­ment and ad­vice.</p>
    <p>All three de­fen­dants are deny­ing the claims in court pa­pers filed re­gard­ing the dif­fer­ent pe­ri­ods when she was un­der their care.</p>
    <p>Chilean-born Ms Zu­niga, who cur­rently uses a wheel­chair, had sought med­i­cal at­ten­tion for neck pain and al­tered sen­sa­tion in her hands. A scan showed a tu­mour on her spinal cord.</p>
    <p>She un­der­went surgery per­formed by Dr Ng Puay Yong on Oct 18, 2012, to ex­cise the tu­mour. Al­though the post-surgery scan showed im­prove­ments in her con­di­tion, she al­leged that the op­er­a­tion was botched and the tu­mour was not wholly ex­cised, while healthy spinal cord tis­sue was re­moved, ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers filed by her lawyer Raj Singh Shergill.</p>
    <p>De­tails of the claims and de­fences are ex­pected to sur­face in due course at the trial, set for early next year in the High Court.</p>
    <p>In deny­ing Ms Zu­niga’s claims, Dr Ng noted that she was made aware of the risks and benefits of the surgery.</p>
    <p>Post-surgery, her con­di­tion im­proved, but a re­view from Dr Ng that in­cluded a Canada-based pathol­o­gist’s find­ing held that the rem­nant tu­mour was a low-grade as­tro­cy­toma – a type of can­cer that can form in the spinal cord – and Ms Zu­niga was rec­om­mended var­i­ous op­tions, in­clud­ing re­peat surgery, ra­dio­ther­apy and chemo­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said it was well known that spinal cord low-grade as­tro­cy­toma can re­cur even af­ter com­plete re­moval.</p>
    <p>His lawyers, led by Mr Eric Tin and Mr Jansen Aw, said on his be­half: “While our client em­pathises with the pa­tient, as he had man­aged her ap­pro­pri­ately ac­cord­ing to ac­cepted stan­dard of care and best prac­tices, and acted in her best in­ter­ests, he strongly de­nies her al­le­ga­tions of breach of duty of care and neg­li­gence.”</p>
    <p>Ms Zu­niga’s last as­sess­ment with Dr Ng was on Feb 7, 2013, when she was still able to walk.</p>
    <p>But on April 20 that year, she con­sulted neu­ro­sur­geon Premku­mar Pil­lay for a sec­ond opin­ion, com­plain­ing of tin­gling and stiff­ness in both legs, es­pe­cially the right.</p>
    <p>Dr Pil­lay ex­am­ined her and dis­cussed her treat­ment op­tions for the low-grade as­tro­cy­toma, in­clud­ing biopsy, mon­i­tor­ing, surgery or ra­dio­ther­apy, with pos­si­ble anti-tu­mour med­i­ca­tions. Ma­te­rial risks were also dis­cussed, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Zu­niga con­sented to be­ing treated by ra­di­a­tion on­col­ogy spe­cial­ist Ed­ward Yang, who treated her be­tween May and July 2013. In ad­di­tion to ra­di­a­tion, she also had chemo­ther­apy ad­min­is­tered by a med­i­cal on­col­o­gist.</p>
    <p>Dr Yang had con­curred with Dr Pil­lay on the likely as­tro­cy­toma as di­ag­nosed. He also ad­vised her on the treat­ment op­tions and the ma­te­rial risks in­volved.</p>
    <p>A re­view with Dr Yang in July 2013 showed that Ms Zu­niga had im­prove­ments in her lower limb power and sen­sa­tion, could walk and showed no numb­ness. But she did not turn up for a fol­low-up re­view and scan in Oc­to­ber 2013 as ad­vised.</p>
    <p>Her con­di­tion con­tin­ued to sta­bilise, and by May 2014 she was fit enough to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>Dr Pil­lay con­tin­ued to man­age her un­til she left his care in Septem­ber 2016 and sought help else­where.</p>
    <p>Den­tons Rodyk lawyers Lek Siang Pheng and Vanessa Lim said the two doc­tors “fully em­pathise with Ms Zu­niga’s sit­u­a­tion” and “they have given their best ef­forts to treat her rare and dif­fi­cult med­i­cal con­di­tion and care and treat­ment in ac­cor­dance with ac­cepted med­i­cal prac­tices, and have coun­selled her on all suit­able op­tions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Shergill summed up Ms Zu­niga’s claims be­fore Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner Mavis Chionh last Oc­to­ber, dur­ing a hear­ing on an in­ter­locu­tory mat­ter: “The first de­fen­dant per­formed wrong-level surgery. It was a re­versible er­ror. It was in that con­text that the plain­tiff went to the sec­ond de­fen­dant for a sec­ond opin­ion. There were three op­tions: do noth­ing; go back in and re­set the tu­mour; ra­di­ate the spinal cord.</p>
    <p>“Once you ra­di­ate the spinal cord, you de­stroy it be­cause of the dam­age such as re­nal mal­func­tion and the risk of can­cer. So the plain­tiff’s case against the sec­ond and third de­fen­dant is this: Be­fore you ad­vo­cate ra­di­a­tion ther­apy, given the se­vere con­se­quences, you are un­der a duty to look at all the records pro­vided to you, and once you have done that, what the first de­fen­dant did would have been ap­par­ent.”</p>
    <p>A High Court hear­ing is due next week to de­cide if the case should be bi­fur­cated and the li­a­bil­ity is­sue de­cided at trial first.</p>
