    <p>Media group Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH) is among more than 70 or­gan­i­sa­tions that have been lauded for mak­ing social con­tri­bu­tions that go be­yond cor­po­rate social re­spon­si­bil­ity ini­tia­tives. It is the third year in a row that SPH has been con­ferred the Cham­pi­ons of Good award.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Vol­un­teer and Phi­lan­thropy Cen­tre (NVPC) gave the honour to 74 or­gan­i­sa­tions yesterday.</p>
    <p>In a video on his Face­book page,</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said: “All com­pa­nies hope for good times, but true cham­pi­ons make time for good. If there is a sil­ver lin­ing from this cri­sis, it is how the pandemic has strength­ened our sense of com­mon pur­pose as a na­tion and brought out the best from each one of us.</p>
    <p>“Many com­pa­nies have stepped for­ward during this cri­sis to sup­port vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of our so­ci­ety and ral­lied their staff and stake­hold­ers to sup­port these causes.”</p>
    <p>SPH chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Yat Chung said: “As a so­cially re­spon­si­ble company, we be­lieve in giv­ing back to the com­mu­nity. We are hon­oured that SPH has been recog­nised as a Cham­pion of Good.</p>
    <p>“It is a strong af­fir­ma­tion of the im­pact of our cor­po­rate giv­ing and how vol­un­teerism is em­bed­ded in our company’s cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“I am proud of the work of our staff vol­un­teers, who have ral­lied to good causes and care for the vul­ner­a­ble in our com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons of Good was launched in 2017 as a na­tional recog­ni­tion frame­work un­der the Company of Good, an arm of NVPC.</p>
    <p>It recog­nises or­gan­i­sa­tions that are ex­em­plary in do­ing good and have mul­ti­plied the pos­i­tive im­pact by en­gag­ing their part­ners and stake­hold­ers in col­lab­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>As of this year, there are 97 re­cip­i­ents of the Cham­pi­ons of Good award, in­clud­ing yesterday’s batch.</p>
    <p>Some of the 2020 award win­ners in­clude Bar­clays, May­bank Sin­ga­pore, TSMP Law and Pan Pa­cific Ho­tels Group.</p>
    <p>NVPC chair­man Mil­dred Tan said: “By looking be­yond con­ven­tional busi­ness goals, these Cham­pi­ons of Good have dis­played re­silience and adapt­abil­ity in their fight to over­come the eco­nomic down­turn and are set­ting the prece­dent in ro­bust cor­po­rate cit­i­zen­ship for other stake­hold­ers and in­dus­try peers to fol­low.”</p>
