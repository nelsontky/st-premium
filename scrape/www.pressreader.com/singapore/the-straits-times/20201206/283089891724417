    <p>Keep­ing up with the Jone­ses</p>
    <p>This is a prob­lem in­ad­ver­tently caused by peo­ple who like to put up photos of their lives for all to see on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, 17 per cent of folks here like to keep track of not what they are spend­ing on, but what their friends are spend­ing on. So if they see oth­ers splurg­ing on branded goods or din­ing at ex­pen­sive restau­rants, they feel pres­sured to do the same so that they too can “show off” on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>In do­ing so, many are in­clined to over­spend, which is the No. 1 rea­son why peo­ple chalk up credit card debt in the first place.</p>
    <p>While a pic­ture may speak a thou­sand words, it won’t re­veal how much money the per­son has in his bank ac­count or whether the item has been bought us­ing loans in­stead of cash.</p>
    <p>Even if the sub­ject of your envy is truly wealthy, you won’t find joy by pre­tend­ing to keep up when you can­not af­ford to.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber that the hap­pi­est peo­ple in this world are usu­ally not the rich­est – they don’t have every­thing but they make the best of every­thing they have.</p>
    <p>The OCBC sur­vey re­veals a sil­ver lin­ing though: The pan­demic has made many re­alise the im­por­tance of hav­ing sound fi­nan­cial plan­ning to help them tide over a cri­sis. So even though the in­comes of many are be­ing hit by the re­ces­sion, there is a mar­ginal growth in the num­ber of peo­ple who try to save a bit more every month. Do­ing so will en­able them to slowly build up more than six months of emer­gency re­serves, which will be crit­i­cal in case of job losses.</p>
    <p>Just as you can stay healthy by get­ting rid of all your bad habits, you can slowly build a healthy nest egg by be­ing just as rig­or­ous with your bad fi­nan­cial habits.</p>
