    <p>My fam­ily had is­sues with our wa­ter sup­ply one night, and called PUB which promptly sent two work­ers to my home to in­ves­ti­gate.</p>
    <p>The two work­ers took 30 min­utes to col­lect a sam­ple, and while do­ing so in my kitchen in­ter­mit­tently pulled down their face masks.</p>
    <p>One of them even coughed while the mask was low­ered.</p>
    <p>My wife asked why they were not keep­ing their masks on, and they re­torted that it was eas­ier for them to talk to her with their masks low­ered.</p>
    <p>We were ap­palled by the lack of ad­her­ence to mask-wear­ing pro­to­col. This be­hav­iour is un­ac­cept­able at a time when the coronaviru­s is still spread­ing in Sin­ga­pore. Lee Keng Yeow</p>
