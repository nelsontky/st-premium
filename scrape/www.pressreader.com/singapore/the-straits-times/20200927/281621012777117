    <p>The ac­tual Covid-19 death toll in In­done­sia could be three times the re­ported fig­ure, which reached 10,308 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Dicky Budi­man, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Grif­fith Uni­ver­sity in Australia, said In­done­sia had the high­est num­ber of Covid-19 deaths of any Asean coun­try and that the na­tion placed third in Covid-19 deaths among Asian coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Dicky, the death toll is a valid in­di­ca­tor of Covid-19 man­age­ment in cer­tain coun­tries and re­gions.</p>
    <p>But he said In­done­sia’s ac­tual death toll could be three times the re­ported num­ber.</p>
    <p>“In­done­sia should re­fer to the WHO (World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion) def­i­ni­tion of a Covid-19 death and should im­ple­ment it in the coun­try for our own sake,” Mr Dicky said, as quoted by Kom­pas.com on Friday.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the WHO, a Covid-19 death is de­fined for mon­i­tor­ing pur­poses as a death re­sult­ing from a clin­i­cally com­pat­i­ble ill­ness in a prob­a­ble or con­firmed Covid-19 case un­less there is a clear al­ter­na­tive cause of death that can­not be re­lated to Covid-19 – for ex­am­ple, trauma.</p>
    <p>There should be no pe­riod of com­plete re­cov­ery from Covid-19 be­tween the ill­ness and death.</p>
    <p>A death due to Covid-19 may not be at­trib­uted to another dis­ease, such as can­cer, and should be counted in­de­pen­dently of pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions that are sus­pected of trig­ger­ing a se­vere course of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Dicky said In­done­sia’s more than 10,000 deaths from Covid-19 were ones that were con­firmed.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, we do not count (the deaths of peo­ple with) prob­a­ble or sus­pected sta­tuses.</p>
    <p>If we count them all, we might see three times as many,” he added.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­ported 4,494 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal num­ber of cases to 271,339, of­fi­cial data from the Health Min­istry showed.</p>
    <p>The coun­try also re­ported 90 new deaths from the virus.</p>
