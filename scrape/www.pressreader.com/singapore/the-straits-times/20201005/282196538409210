    <p>•</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has slammed oil de­mand and prices is forc­ing en­ergy ma­jors to tighten their belts on ex­plo­ration, even if find­ing new de­posits re­mains es­sen­tial to their ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>While the sec­tor is in­creas­ingly di­ver­si­fy­ing into greener en­er­gies such as elec­tric­ity and wind power, its core business re­mains oil and gas.</p>
    <p>“Ques­tions abound over whether it is still prof­itable to look for oil, given sub­dued de­mand growth prospects and a low-price en­vi­ron­ment,” Mr Stephen Bren­nock, an an­a­lyst at oil bro­kers PVM, told Agence France-Presse. “The an­swer seems not, judg­ing by the re­cent spate of mas­sive hy­dro­car­bon as­set write-downs.</p>
    <p>“Set against this back­drop, I don’t ex­pect a re­bound in drilling in the medium term,” he added.</p>
    <p>“In­stead, oil ma­jors will be forced to beef up their green en­ergy port­fo­lios in or­der to sur­vive.”</p>
    <p>SLASHED PROJECTS</p>
    <p>Com­pared with pre-virus plans, the en­ergy sec­tor has slashed ex­plo­ration projects in Bri­tain’s North Sea wa­ters by 70 per cent and by 30 per cent off the coast of Nor­way, ac­cord­ing to re­search group West­wood.</p>
    <p>United States oil gi­ant ExxonMo­bil has cut its to­tal ex­plo­ration plans by 30 per cent, or an in­vest­ment re­duc­tion of US$10 bil­lion (S$13.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Euro­pean ri­vals Eni, BP and Equinor have car­ried out sim­i­lar moves, which have in turn hurt sub-con­trac­tors in­clud­ing French oil ser­vices group CGG, which ex­pects rev­enue to slump 40 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>In the US, more than 30 oil ex­plo­ration and pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies have this year filed for bank­ruptcy, ac­cord­ing to Texan law firm Haynes and Boone.</p>
    <p>If oil prices re­main stuck around the cur­rent US$40 per bar­rel level, a fur­ther 150 such com­pa­nies could be lost by 2022, es­ti­mates re­search group Rys­tad En­ergy.</p>
    <p>“Drilling pro­grammes will be ham­pered in the near term, in par­tic­u­lar in US shale ar­eas, but also else­where, be­cause of im­me­di­ate cost-cut­ting mea­sures,” said JBC En­ergy an­a­lyst Raphaela Hein.</p>
    <p>“In the past, we have seen that mas­sive cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture cuts to ma­jors’ bud­gets did not re­ally im­pact their fu­ture pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>“As such, we think that they will con­tinue to look for new fields – maybe to a slightly lesser ex­tent... and keep pro­duc­tion within their long-term plans.</p>
    <p>“Of course this will con­trib­ute to en­sur­ing their sur­vival,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Hein, how­ever, said that Arc­tic projects ap­peared to be “eco­nom­i­cally un­vi­able”.</p>
    <p>This, de­spite the vast area forecast to have 13 per cent of the world’s oil re­serves and 30 per cent of its undis­cov­ered nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>In July, Rus­sia’s Gazprom Neft and An­glo-Dutch gi­ant Shell an­nounced a part­ner­ship to ex­plore in the Arc­tic.</p>
    <p>While oil prices re­bounded strongly af­ter briefly turn­ing neg­a­tive in the early days of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the world’s main oil con­tracts Brent North Sea and West Texas In­ter­me­di­ate have failed to build on those gains – and last week fell heav­ily to un­der US$40.</p>
    <p>“Mar­kets right now do not be­lieve there is a fu­ture for oil,” said SEB an­a­lyst Bjarne Schiel­d­rop.</p>
    <p>“For how long we’ll have re­duced drilling de­pends on the oil price,” he added.</p>
    <p>Even so, the ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in Au­gust ap­proved oil and gas drilling in Alaska’s Arc­tic Na­tional Wildlife Refuge, an­ger­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists in the process.</p>
    <p>While the oil price cri­sis is mak­ing the re­al­i­sa­tion of such projects un­likely, “po­lit­i­cal will may still trump” that, said JBC En­ergy’s Ms Hein.</p>
