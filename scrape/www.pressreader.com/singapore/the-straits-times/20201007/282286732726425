    <p>Ikea Sin­ga­pore will hire 200 peo­ple for its new Jurong store at sub­ur­ban mall Jem de­spite a fall in rev­enue in its last fi­nan­cial year, the firm an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The store – the third Ikea out­let here – is slated to open next year and will span around 6,500 sq m across three floors.</p>
    <p>Ikea’s South-east Asia and Mex­ico oper­a­tions re­tained all its work­ers through­out the lock­downs and will con­tinue to recruit staff de­spite a 7.4 per cent drop in rev­enue for its nine South-east Asian stores in the 12 months to Aug 31.</p>
    <p>The stores posted $966 mil­lion in sales af­ter fac­ing clo­sures of up to 21/ months, sup­ply chal­lenges and lim­its on build­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>When in­come from its five Ikeaan­chored shop­ping cen­tres that are op­er­ated by Ikano Cen­tres is fac­tored in, to­tal turnover for the year comes in at $1.1 bil­lion – $90 mil­lion less than the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>Ikea’s turnover in Sin­ga­pore was $304 mil­lion, about 10 per cent down from last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Jaap Doorn­bos, its re­tail di­rec­tor for Sin­ga­pore and Viet­nam, said: “Our Sin­ga­pore stores en­dured the long­est clo­sures of any in our re­gion – at 73 days, 20 per cent of the year. Our Ikea food oper­a­tions were closed even longer and we have cur­tailed oper­a­tions even upon open­ing.</p>
    <p>“Given these chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances, we are very sat­is­fied that the turnover dur­ing the last fi­nan­cial year dropped just 10 per cent – half of the share of the days that the stores were closed.</p>
    <p>“These re­sults are driven by a very strong e-com­merce business, the great in­spi­ra­tion peo­ple are find­ing in our stores upon re­open­ing and the con­tin­ued in­ter­est in home fur­nish­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ikea said stores were largely able to con­tinue sell­ing on­line dur­ing the long clo­sures. Work­ers set up large-scale ful­fil­ment oper­a­tions and ad­di­tional trans­port was sourced to open up more de­liv­ery slots. “By the end of the fi­nan­cial year, cus­tomers had placed more than 525,000 on­line or­ders and rung up $135 mil­lion in Web sales – more than dou­ble the com­pany’s e-com­merce turnover from the pre­vi­ous year,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris­tian Ro­jk­jaer, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Ikea South-east Asia and Mex­ico, added: “The Covid-19 cri­sis changed how many of us value life at home. At a time of ur­gent need, peo­ple turned to Ikea to set up home of­fices, study cor­ners, out­door liv­ing ar­eas and func­tional kitchens.</p>
    <p>“Our pri­or­ity is to do ev­ery­thing we can to keep co-work­ers and cus­tomers safe, and to keep go­ing – be­cause our vi­sions to cre­ate a bet­ter ev­ery­day life for the many has never been more rel­e­vant.”</p>
    <p>Ikea South-east Asia and Mex­ico – one of 12 Ikea fran­chisees around the world – op­er­ates stores in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Thai­land as well as the port­fo­lio of Ikano Cen­tres with some 1,500 ten­ants and four mil­lion sq ft in leasable space. It will en­ter Mex­ico and the Philip­pines next year.</p>
