    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte (left) yes­ter­day added to the sense of out­rage in the Philip­pines af­ter see­ing the video of an off-duty po­lice­man killing in cold blood a mother and her son. “I don’t think that you can es­cape the rigours of jus­tice be­cause it was caught on TV. Even I am dumb­founded,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even for Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, the sight of an off­duty po­lice­man killing in cold blood a mother and a son she was des­per­ately try­ing to pro­tect was too bru­tal.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think that you can es­cape the rigours of jus­tice be­cause it was caught on TV. Even I am dumb­founded… That’s un­fair and too bru­tal,” Mr Duterte said of the killings dur­ing his tele­vised Cab­i­net meet­ing on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>He said he had seen the fiveminute video of Sergeant Jonel Nuezca, 46, shoot­ing at close range Mrs Sonya Gre­go­rio, 52, and her son An­thony Gre­go­rio on Sun­day in Paniqui town, Tar­lac prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Po­lice re­ports said the con­fronta­tion be­gan af­ter Mr Gre­go­rio, 25, set off an air can­non made out of a PVC pipe, cre­at­ing loud noises. The sit­u­a­tion de­te­ri­o­rated into a heated ar­gu­ment over a land dis­pute. Through­out the in­ci­dent, Mrs Gre­go­rio had her arms wrapped around her son to pre­vent Nuezca from ar­rest­ing him.</p>
    <p>Sec­onds be­fore the shoot­ing, Nuezca’s daugh­ter, a mi­nor, ap­proached Mrs Gre­go­rio, slapped the woman’s arm, and told her to let go of her son. “Just let go of him!</p>
    <p>Just let go!” the girl shouted.</p>
    <p>Mrs Gre­go­rio told her: “You tell (your father) to let go.” When the girl shouted that her father is a po­lice­man, the woman replied “I don’t care!” and taunted her.</p>
    <p>Nuezca asked Mrs Gre­go­rio: “Do you want me to end you right now?” Then, with­out warn­ing, he pulled out his 9mm pis­tol and shot her in the head as dozens of by­standers watched. At least two peo­ple took videos with their phones. Nuezca then shot Mr Gre­go­rio, also in the head.</p>
    <p>Just be­fore Nuezca fled the scene, he again shot Mrs Gre­go­rio in the head as she was sprawled on the ground.</p>
    <p>Nuezca sur­ren­dered hours later and is now fac­ing mur­der charges. In­ves­ti­ga­tors said he ex­pressed re­morse over what he did.</p>
    <p>The bru­tal mur­ders pro­voked a wave of out­rage di­rected at the gov­ern­ment and once again cast a harsh light on per­ceived abuses by po­lice­men pur­port­edly em­bold­ened by Pres­i­dent Duterte, who is ac­cused of mol­ly­cod­dling of­fi­cers car­ry­ing out his bloody drug war.</p>
    <p>But Mr Duterte said Nuezca had crossed the line.</p>
    <p>“You do not fol­low the law, you sal­vage (sum­mar­ily ex­e­cute), you kill, then I’m sorry. That is not part of our agree­ment on how we should do our work… Lock him up, and don’t let him out,” he said.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed Nuezca as an “aber­ra­tion” in the po­lice force, adding: “He has some­thing wrong in the head.”</p>
    <p>But crit­ics of Pres­i­dent Duterte in­sisted that the killing was not an “iso­lated in­ci­dent”, as his al­lies had as­serted, and that it should lead to po­lice re­forms and a halt to his con</p>
    <p>tro­ver­sial crack­down on the drug trade.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte has stood firmly be­hind the po­lice, as the death toll in his drug war soared past 8,000.</p>
    <p>Rights groups have re­ported higher num­bers, and said the vi­o­lence has con­tin­ued even as the coun­try re­mains un­der a coro­n­avirus lock­down an­nounced in March.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte has at­trib­uted most of the killings to turf wars among drug gangs, and ex­on­er­ated po­lice­men in­volved by say­ing they merely shot back when fired upon. He has also said he will par­don any of­fi­cer found guilty of mur­der while car­ry­ing out his crack­down.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have said such high-level rhetoric is be­ing in­ter­preted within the po­lice force as “per­mis­sion to kill”.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment knows that the bloody mur­der of a mother and son in Tar­lac is not an iso­lated case any­more. Blood­lust cops are ev­ery</p>
    <p>where,” Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ruffy Bi­a­zon told on­line news site Poli­tiko.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Stella Luz Quimbo filed a res­o­lu­tion yes­ter­day seek­ing a con­gres­sional in­quiry into the killings as these re­late to the “tac­ti­cal knowl­edge and men­tal fit­ness” of the 200,000-strong po­lice force.</p>
    <p>But Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Ilde­brandi Usana, spokesman for the Philip­pine Na­tional Po­lice (PNP), said there is no need for that. “This is an iso­lated case. (A case) has al­ready been filed, and (Nuezca’s) dis­missal will be forth­com­ing. The PNP will have to move on from there,” he told ABS-CBN News.</p>
    <p>He said the po­lice force al­ready “have had many changes that had al­ready been ini­ti­ated”.</p>
    <p>More than 4,800 erring po­lice­men have been dis­missed, and some 17,000 are fac­ing ad­min­is­tra­tive cases, he dis­closed.</p>
