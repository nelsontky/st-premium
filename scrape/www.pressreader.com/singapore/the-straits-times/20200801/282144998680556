    <p>Three users of il­le­gally mod­i­fied power-as­sisted bi­cy­cles (PAB) ap­peared in a district court on Thurs­day fol­low­ing sep­a­rate in­ci­dents in which the bat­ter­ies on their ve­hi­cles caught fire. No one was in­jured in these in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>In the first such con­vic­tions, Sin­ga­pore­ans Isaac Choo Chi Kin, 24, Low Yi Hong, 31, and Lee Gee Kian, 42, were each fined be­tween $3,000 and $3,500.</p>
    <p>Lee and Low pleaded guilty to per­mit­ting the un­law­ful al­ter­ation of the PABs and keep­ing the mod­i­fied ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Choo, on the other hand, had al­lowed some­one else to use a PAB that had been un­law­fully al­tered. He also ad­mit­ted he had kept an un­reg­is­tered PAB.</p>
    <p>Choo re­ceived the high­est fine of $3,500. He had ear­lier al­lowed a friend to use his PAB and it was re­turned on Jan 3 this year.</p>
    <p>Choo had left the ve­hi­cle to be charged for about an hour at a stair­case land­ing of a Choa Chu Kang Av­enue 3 hous­ing block later that day when his fa­ther told him that its bat­tery had spon­ta­neously com­busted.</p>
    <p>Since Feb 1, 2018, all power-as­sisted bi­cy­cles must be reg­is­tered with the LTA. Only e-bikes with EN15194 cer­ti­fi­ca­tion are ap­proved for use.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) pros­e­cu­tor Ng Jun Kai told the court: “The ac­cused... ad­mit­ted to SCDF (Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force) of­fi­cers that he had con­ducted mod­i­fi­ca­tions to the said PAB by up­grad­ing the mo­tor – re­plac­ing the mo­tor with a speed­way bat­tery pack – and had in­stalled a con­troller.”</p>
    <p>Lee, who was fined $3,300, bought his PAB last Novem­ber. The fol­low­ing month, he paid $350 to a man, known only as “Xiao Dao”, to in­stall an ex­ter­nal por­ta­ble bat­tery.</p>
    <p>Lee used his non-com­pli­ant PAB for his work as a de­liv­ery rider. The ve­hi­cle was near Choa Chu Kang MRT sta­tion on Jan 3 this year when its bat­tery spon­ta­neously com­busted.</p>
    <p>Since Feb 1, 2018, all PABs must be reg­is­tered with the LTA. Only ebikes with EN15194 cer­ti­fi­ca­tion are ap­proved for use.</p>
    <p>Low, who was fined $3,000, had bor­rowed a PAB from some­one else. Low also bought a spare bat­tery for it on Dec 25 last year.</p>
    <p>An­other man who de­liv­ered the item then car­ried out some works to at­tach a cable to the PAB’s in­ter­nal cir­cuitry so that the spare bat­tery could be used with the ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>Low tried to use the spare bat­tery the next day but no­ticed that there was no con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>He re­moved it and con­tin­ued us­ing the orig­i­nal in­ter­nal bat­tery, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Low later no­ticed that the spare bat­tery ap­peared bloated and im­me­di­ately placed it out­side his flat at Tah Ching Road in Ta­man Jurong.</p>
    <p>“Shortly af­ter, the bat­tery started emit­ting sparks and a fire en­sured. The po­lice and SCDF were ac­ti­vated to the ac­cused’s home,” said Mr Ng.</p>
