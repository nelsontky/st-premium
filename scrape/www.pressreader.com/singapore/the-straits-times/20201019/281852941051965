    <p>But it em­pha­sises that un­con­ven­tional arms, weapons of mass de­struc­tion have no place in its de­fence doc­trine</p>
    <p>TEHERAN • Iran yes­ter­day said a long­stand­ing UN em­bargo on arms sales to and from the Is­lamic Repub­lic has ex­pired, in line with a 2015 land­mark nu­clear agree­ment with world pow­ers from which the US has with­drawn.</p>
    <p>Teheran, which could now pur­chase weapons from Rus­sia, China and else­where, has hailed the de­vel­op­ment as a di­plo­matic vic­tory over its arch en­emy, Wash­ing­ton, which had tried to main­tain an in­def­i­nite freeze on arms sales.</p>
    <p>“As of today, all re­stric­tions on the trans­fer of arms, re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties and fi­nan­cial ser­vices to and from the Is­lamic Repub­lic of Iran... are all au­to­mat­i­cally ter­mi­nated,” the for­eign min­istry said in a state­ment sent out on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The em­bargo on the sale of con­ven­tional arms to Iran was due to start ex­pir­ing pro­gres­sively from yes­ter­day un­der the terms of the UN res­o­lu­tion that blessed the 2015 nu­clear deal be­tween the Is­lamic Repub­lic and world pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“As of today, the Is­lamic Repub­lic may pro­cure any nec­es­sary arms and equip­ment from any source with­out any le­gal re­stric­tions, and solely based on its de­fen­sive needs,” the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>It in­sisted that un­der the terms of the deal, struck with the United States, China, Bri­tain, France, Ger­many and Rus­sia, “the lift­ing of arms re­stric­tions and the travel ban were de­signed to be au­to­matic with no other ac­tion re­quired”.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump with­drew his coun­try from the nu­clear deal in 2018 and has uni­lat­er­ally be­gun reim­pos­ing sanc­tions on Iran. But Wash­ing­ton suf­fered a set­back in Au­gust when it failed to win sup­port from the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil to in­def­i­nitely ex­tend the arms em­bargo.</p>
    <p>It was “a mo­men­tous day for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity”, the Ira­nian min­istry said yes­ter­day, adding that the world had stood with Teheran “in de­fi­ance of the US regime’s ef­forts”. But the min­istry also stressed that “un­con­ven­tional arms, weapons of mass de­struc­tion and a buy­ing spree of con­ven­tional arms have no place in Iran’s de</p>
    <p>fence doc­trine”.</p>
    <p>De­spite pulling out of the nu­clear deal, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in­sists it is still a “par­tic­i­pant” and can there­fore go ahead with reim­pos­ing sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has said it has de­cided to uni­lat­er­ally re­in­state virtu</p>
    <p>ally all of the UN sanc­tions on Iran lifted un­der the ac­cord.</p>
    <p>But Wash­ing­ton’s le­gal ar­gu­ment has been re­jected by al­most the en­tire UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, with Euro­pean al­lies of the US say­ing the pri­or­ity is to sal­vage a peace­ful so­lu­tion to Iran’s nu­clear pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Ira­nian For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif said in a tweet that the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity had “pro­tected” the nu­clear deal and that yes­ter­day marked the “nor­mal­i­sa­tion” of Iran’s de­fence co­op­er­a­tion with the world.</p>
