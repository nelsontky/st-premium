    <p>Some years ago, Liu Qin (not her real name), now 51, had a melt­down at a bus sta­tion on her way to her vil­lage in An­hui prov­ince for the Chi­nese New Year hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>She started shout­ing and tear­ing at her clothes, then blacked out and was taken to hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>She re­cov­ered from the episode and after spend­ing some time at home in An­hui, she re­turned to Bei­jing, where she had worked as an ah yi, or do­mes­tic helper, since she was a teenager.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing those decades in the cap­i­tal city, she got mar­ried and had a son. But the years of strug­gle mak­ing a liv­ing in Bei­jing, a harsh en­vi­ron­ment for a mi­grant worker in the in­for­mal sec­tor, took their toll. Life be­came harder still after her hus­band and son went back to their home county for their son’s ed­u­ca­tion, leaving her alone in the huge me­trop­o­lis of 21 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The sense of iso­la­tion, of hav­ing no one close to ease the anx­i­eties and stress of daily liv­ing, af­fected her men­tal health.</p>
    <p>Lone­li­ness is a ma­jor prob­lem for in­creas­ing num­bers of Chi­nese who live in one-per­son house­holds.</p>
    <p>It is a feel­ing that has of­ten as­sailed Ms Stephanie Li, 34, a sales ex­ec­u­tive who lived alone in Bei­jing for 12 years be­fore she got mar­ried in June this year. “Es­pe­cially after my friends around me got mar­ried and had chil­dren, there were few means by which I could dis­pel my lone­li­ness,” she said.</p>
    <p>Men­tal health prob­lems are just one of the many chal­lenges that China will have to grap­ple with as the num­ber of one-per­son house­holds rises.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Pro­fes­sor Jean Ye­ung Wei-Jun, who is the found­ing di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Fam­ily and Pop­u­la­tion Re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), such house­holds are set to more than dou­ble from 60 mil­lion (15 per cent of all house­holds) in 2010 to 133 mil­lion (24 per cent) in 2050.</p>
    <p>The rise of one-per­son house­holds in China is part of a global trend that is most no­tice­able in ad­vanced coun­tries. More than 40 per cent of house­holds in north­ern Europe are sin­gle-per­son ones.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of its large pop­u­la­tion, China has the largest num­ber of one-per­son house­holds in the world, although they make up a smaller pro­por­tion of the to­tal num­ber of house­holds. Such house­holds are also grow­ing faster than other house­hold types in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mar­ried-cou­ple house­holds are ex­pected to grow from 18.99 per cent of all house­holds in 2010 to 21.75 per cent in 2050, ac­cord­ing to a study by Prof Ye­ung and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Feng Qiushi of NUS.</p>
    <p>But house­holds com­pris­ing a mar­ried cou­ple with chil­dren are pro­jected to fall from 39.75 per cent to 30.04 per cent of the to­tal, while three-gen­er­a­tion house­holds will be­come scarcer, shrink­ing from 17.37 per cent to 5.52 per cent.</p>
    <p>For many peo­ple, liv­ing alone is a tem­po­rary state be­fore they marry, re­marry or re­unite with fam­ily mem­bers. But for a grow­ing num­ber of Chi­nese, liv­ing alone could be a per­ma­nent state.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing num­bers of one-per­son house­holds are a con­cern, as tra­di­tional so­cial net­works break down and pres­sure on re­sources in­creases as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>WHO IS LIV­ING SOLO?</p>
    <p>Chi­nese peo­ple liv­ing in one-per­son house­holds are a het­ero­ge­neous lot, cut­ting across age groups, gen­der, ed­u­ca­tion and in­come lev­els, and ru­ral and ur­ban ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Many fac­tors drive the growth in such house­holds in China, such as rapid ur­ban­i­sa­tion, mi­gra­tion, an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and chang­ing life choices.</p>
    <p>Ur­ban­i­sa­tion, with its high pop­u­la­tion den­si­ties, small liv­ing quar­ters and mul­ti­tude of ser­vices, op­por­tu­ni­ties and free­doms, per­mits a life­style that is con­ducive to liv­ing on one’s own,</p>
    <p>noted de­mog­ra­pher Joseph Chamie in an ar­ti­cle for In­ter Press Ser­vice in 2017.</p>
    <p>He added that the mi­gra­tion of young peo­ple from ru­ral to ur­ban ar­eas re­sulted in the el­derly liv­ing alone and far away from fam­ily mem­bers. This has been the case in China, where it is com­mon to have old folk liv­ing alone in the coun­try­side or with grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Mi­gra­tion from ru­ral ar­eas to ur­ban cen­tres has been driv­ing and will con­tinue to drive the growth of such house­holds.</p>
    <p>In the early years of China’s eco­nomic re­forms, most mi­grant work­ers went alone to the cities to work, while more tend to move with their fam­i­lies now, noted</p>
    <p>Prof Ye­ung.</p>
    <p>Age­ing is also a ma­jor fac­tor in the rise of one-per­son house­holds as peo­ple live longer and have bet­ter health, and as those who lose spouses choose to live alone.</p>
    <p>In China, peo­ple hav­ing fewer chil­dren also means that there is a limit to how much fam­ily mem­bers can pro­vide care to the el­derly, noted Prof Ye­ung.</p>
    <p>Among older adults liv­ing alone in China, the fastest-grow­ing group is made up of those 80 years and above, or “the old­est old”, she said at a re­cent we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by the East Asian In­sti­tute at NUS.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing alone in old age leads to so­cial iso­la­tion and lone­li­ness and in­creases the risks of phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal prob­lems, she added. El­derly peo­ple liv­ing alone suf­fer more from de­pres­sion and get less sat­is­fac­tion from life. “They will need more at­ten­tion from the gov­ern­ment, com­mu­ni­ties and fam­ily to en­sure that they are not so­cially iso­lated,” she said in an e-mail in­ter­view with The Straits Times. There should be fre­quent checks on them to pre­vent health prob­lems from hap­pen­ing with­out oth­ers know­ing about them.</p>
    <p>Another fast-grow­ing group of adults liv­ing in one-per­son house­holds is that of younger adults who are stay­ing in school longer and then mov­ing from place to place as they start their work­ing life. Dur­ing this time, they live alone in­stead of get­ting mar­ried or liv­ing with some­one else.</p>
    <p>Among young adults liv­ing alone, the largest group is made up of those who are highly ed­u­cated and live alone by choice, noted Prof Ye­ung. “For this group, they are mostly healthy and have re­sources to care for them­selves,” she said.</p>
    <p>Still, among those who are well able to take care of them­selves, there are anx­i­eties. Ms Li, for ex­am­ple, lived in fear of fall­ing se­ri­ously ill and not hav­ing</p>
    <p>some­one to take her to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum of young adults liv­ing solo are those who are dis­ad­van­taged and liv­ing alone in­vol­un­tar­ily. These are the large num­bers of men, about 30 mil­lion, who are of­ten called “bare branches” be­cause they are not able to find a spouse, a con­se­quence of the skewed sex ra­tio – 120 boys for ev­ery 100 girls – that is a re­sult of China’s one-child pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to be a very dif­fi­cult chal­lenge for the coun­try,” said Prof Ye­ung. Some an­a­lysts have said this sit­u­a­tion of huge num­bers of re­luc­tant bach­e­lors could be so­cially desta­bil­is­ing.</p>
    <p>These young men “need a lot of com­mu­nity and gov­ern­ment sup­port to en­sure they are not so­cially iso­lated and have an ad­e­quate so­cial net­work”, she said.</p>
    <p>Some­times so­cial sup­port comes from un­ex­pected quar­ters as it did for Paul (not his real name), 38, a church worker. He was a young man work­ing as a cook in Bei­jing when he met a group of young Chris­tians and de­cided to join their youth fel­low­ship hop­ing to find a wife – which he did, and a new re­li­gion too.</p>
    <p>But many shy, young bach­e­lors sim­ply tune in to live-streamed en­ter­tain­ment pro­vided by young women most nights to as­suage their lone­li­ness.</p>
    <p>Apart from so­cial chal­lenges that come with the rise of one-per­son house­holds, there are eco­nomic ones as well. There is higher de­mand for hous­ing, trans­port and other re­sources such as en­ergy and land. Such house­holds will mean a greater need for cars, tele­vi­sions, wash­ing ma­chines, among other things. “Even though higher con­sump­tion is good for the economy, the con­cern for non-re­new­able re­sources is real,” said Prof Ye­ung.</p>
    <p>In­dus­tries will also have to adapt to chang­ing con­sump­tion pat­terns as a re­sult, such as de­mand for smaller fry­ing pans and smaller pack­ages of food.</p>
    <p>HELP FOR THE LONELY</p>
    <p>While the Covid-19 pan­demic brought home to peo­ple around the world their need for so­cial con­nec­tions, it also showed that there is a good, if par­tial, so­lu­tion to this when phys­i­cal meet-ups are not pos­si­ble: the In­ter­net, which al­lows peo­ple to meet vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>In­deed, as an­a­lysts have pointed out, modern com­mu­ni­ca­tions, par­tic­u­larly the In­ter­net, al­low peo­ple to live alone and yet be con­nected and en­gaged with fam­ily and friends. In China, so­cial me­dia is well de­vel­oped and can play a ma­jor role in con­nect­ing peo­ple re­motely.</p>
    <p>What could also help is hav­ing fam­ily mem­bers or friends liv­ing close by, near enough to share a bowl of warm soup, so peo­ple can still main­tain close so­cial re­la­tions, noted Prof Ye­ung. “So you bring that hot soup to see your friends or your par­ents, by the time you get there, it is some­what warm.”</p>
    <p>Such in­ter­ac­tions, tech­nol­ogy in­cluded, will mit­i­gate the neg­a­tive im­pact of so many peo­ple liv­ing alone, she said.</p>
    <p>With one-per­son house­holds pro­jected to be con­cen­trated in ur­ban cen­tres, ur­ban plan­ning could con­sider the needs of such house­holds and more ef­fi­cient use of re­sources.</p>
    <p>There could be dif­fer­ent hous­ing types, such as hav­ing small and large units within the same block or es­tate so el­derly par­ents can live close to adult chil­dren, or hous­ing units that al­low co-liv­ing so that sin­gle peo­ple can have their pri­vate spa­ces but also share com­mon fa­cil­i­ties such as kitchens, din­ing, work and liv­ing spa­ces. Bet­ter public trans­port would re­duce car use and there­fore pres­sure on re­sources.</p>
    <p>Ser­vices such as healthcare, ac­tiv­ity cen­tres and li­braries could be or­gan­ised to make them more ac­ces­si­ble and bet­ter serve the needs of solo liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Pen­sion and so­cial wel­fare sys­tems, which are un­der­de­vel­oped in China, could be de­signed to cater bet­ter to the dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple liv­ing alone. Civil so­ci­ety can be har­nessed to pro­vide for the so­cial-eco­nomic and psy­cho­log­i­cal needs of the more vul­ner­a­ble one-per­son house­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>An­tic­i­pat­ing and pre­par­ing for the one-per­son house­hold tsunami will help Chi­nese so­ci­ety deal bet­ter with the chal­lenges it brings.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Age&#xAD;ing is a big fac&#xAD;tor in the rise of China&#x2019;s one-per&#xAD;son house&#xAD;holds as peo&#xAD;ple live longer and have bet&#xAD;ter health, and as those who lose spouses opt to live alone, says the writer. Liv&#xAD;ing alone in old age leads to so&#xAD;cial iso&#xAD;la&#xAD;tion and lone&#xAD;li&#xAD;ness and raises the risks of phys&#xAD;i&#xAD;cal and psy&#xAD;cho&#xAD;log&#xAD;i&#xAD;cal prob&#xAD;lems.</p>
