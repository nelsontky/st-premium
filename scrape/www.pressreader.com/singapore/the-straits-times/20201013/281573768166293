    <p>Se­cu­rity cam­eras in Sin­ga­pore homes have been hacked and the footage has been shared on­line. Clips from the hacked footage were up­loaded on porno­graphic sites re­cently, with sev­eral ex­plic­itly tagged as be­ing from Sin­ga­pore. A group ded­i­cated to hack­ing In­ter­net Pro­to­col cam­eras was be­hind the hack­ing.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity cam­eras i n Sin­ga­pore homes have been hacked and the footage has been shared on­line.</p>
    <p>Clips from the hacked footage were up­loaded on porno­graphic sites re­cently, with sev­eral ex­plic­itly tagged as be­ing from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Most of the peo­ple cap­tured in the videos are in var­i­ous stages of un­dress or in com­pro­mis­ing po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>In many of the videos, the lay­out of the homes was typ­i­cal of that of Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>The footage ap­peared to be from In­ter­net Pro­to­col (IP) cam­eras com­mon in homes in Sin­ga­pore. These are in­stalled for se­cu­rity pur­poses or to re­motely mon­i­tor chil­dren, se­niors, do­mes­tic work­ers and pets.</p>
    <p>A group ded­i­cated to hack­ing IP cam­eras was be­hind the hack­ing.</p>
    <p>The group, which can be found on so­cial mes­sag­ing plat­form Dis­cord, has al­most 1,000 mem­bers across the globe.</p>
    <p>As at last Satur­day, mem­bers of the Dis­cord group claimed to have shared more than three ter­abytes of clips with over 70 mem­bers, who paid a sub­scrip­tion fee of US$150 (S$203) for life­time ac­cess to them.</p>
    <p>A sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the clips seem to be from IP cam­eras in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The group claims to have a list of more than 50,000 hacked cam­eras that mem­bers can ac­cess.</p>
    <p>It also claims that VIP mem­bers will be taught how to “ex­plore, watch live and even record” hacked cam­eras through tu­to­ri­als and per­son­alised ses­sions.</p>
    <p>PRE­VENT­ING HACK­ING</p>
    <p>Mr Cle­ment Lee, so­lu­tion ar­chi­tect for the Asia-Pa­cific at cy­ber-se­cu­rity solutions provider Check Point Soft­ware Tech­nolo­gies, said many IP cam­eras are at risk as they are typ­i­cally in­stalled to be ac­cessed re­motely via the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally, it is the re­sult of poor pass­word man­age­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>He ad­vises those with such cam­eras at home to en­sure that their soft­ware is up to date and to avoid us­ing sim­ple pass­words.</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal lawyer James Ow Yong said any­one who hacks such cam­eras will run afoul of the law, even if they are out­side Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Those who share or watch such videos can be pros­e­cuted for of­fences re­lat­ing to voyeurism.</p>
    <p>Mr Ow Yong said: “Where the vic­tim is un­der the age of 16, the ma­te­rial may be con­sid­ered child pornog­ra­phy, and such of­fences at­tract a higher range of sen­tences.”</p>
    <p>He added that those who dis­trib­ute or sell child pornog­ra­phy can be jailed for up to seven years, fined and/or caned.</p>
    <p>A po­lice spokesman said the pub­lic should make a po­lice re­port if they are aware of any­one en­gag­ing in such ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>TAKE PRE­CAU­TIONS</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic are ad­vised to take these pre­cau­tions to se­cure their IP cam­eras:</p>
    <p>Use an IP cam­era from a trusted brand of­fer­ing re­li­able se­cu­rity fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Up­date the soft­ware for the IP cam­era as soon as it is avail­able. Use a strong pass­word, and change it reg­u­larly. Do not use the de­fault pass­word that comes with the IP cam­era.</p>
