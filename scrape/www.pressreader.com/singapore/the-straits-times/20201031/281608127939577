    <p>The demise of one of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est and best-loved depart­ment stores marks the end of an era for the re­tail scene here.</p>
    <p>It may also spell the be­gin­ning of the end for the one-stop-shop for­mat, which has strug­gled to re­main rel­e­vant among younger shop­pers.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of Robin­sons’ store at Jem mall ear­lier this year was a tell­tale sign that all was not well, re­tail ex­perts said, adding that the brand’s exit should have sur­prised no one.</p>
    <p>Depart­ment stores around the world have been gasp­ing for breath even be­fore the pan­demic, which served only to ac­cel­er­ate the de­cline of gi­ants like Neiman Mar­cus in the United States.</p>
    <p>Once a shop­per’s par­adise, depart­ment stores have fallen be­hind the times, out­paced by fast-fash­ion chains and out­priced by on­line re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers noted that Robin­sons had re­vamped its im­age to court a younger crowd in re­cent years, and built hype around its an­nual</p>
    <p>Black Fri­day sale, which would see throngs of shop­pers queue overnight out­side its Or­chard</p>
    <p>Road flag­ship store.</p>
    <p>But th­ese ef­forts – along with a big­ger e-com­merce push with the launch of an on­line store on LazMall ear­lier this year – were not enough to keep it vi­able for its owner, Al-Fut­taim Group.</p>
    <p>The value of­fered by depart­ment stores, such as con­ve­nience and prod­uct cu­ra­tion, has been eroded by e-com­merce and di­rect-to-con­sumer chan­nels, noted Ms Es­ther Ho, di­rec­tor of Nanyang Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>With high rental and in­ven­tory costs, fall­ing foot traf­fic in shop­ping malls and a tourist drought amid pan­demic-re­lated re­stric­tions, Ms Ho said more clo­sures are to be ex­pected if things re­main as they are.</p>
    <p>Ise­tan Sin­ga­pore sank into the red in the first half of this year with a net loss of $317,000, the com­pany re­ported in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Ja­panese re­tailer told The Straits Times there are no plans to down­size, adding that the depart­ment store is meet­ing sales ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Metro and Tangs de­clined to com­ment on the per­for­mance and plans for their depart­ment stores, while Takashimay­a did not re­spond to queries.</p>
    <p>Depart­ment stores saw a 35.3 per cent year-on-year drop in sales in Au­gust, the sec­ond-largest de­cline among re­tail cat­e­gories tracked by the Sin­ga­pore Depart­ment of Statis­tics.</p>
    <p>A ro­bust on­line strat­egy will not be enough to save the model, ex­perts say, as com­pe­ti­tion in the dig­i­tal sphere is fierce, with e-com­merce mar­ket­places that of­fer an end­less ar­ray, in­clud­ing items that depart­ment stores are known for. Th­ese sites also do not have to con­tend with the high prices of down­town rentals or the soar­ing costs of a huge in­ven­tory.</p>
    <p>A nar­rower fo­cus and bet­ter cus­tomer ser­vice across both off­line and on­line chan­nels may cre­ate a path for­ward, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mr Amos Tan, a se­nior lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness, said that in the ab­sence of unique prod­ucts, depart­ment stores must rely on data an­a­lyt­ics of con­sumer trends and shop­pers’ be­hav­iour, seam­less dig­i­tal and in-store ex­pe­ri­ences, and a solid mem­ber­ship re­wards pro­gramme to sur­vive and grow their base.</p>
    <p>At least one lo­cal depart­ment store is ris­ing to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>BHG, which has five stores here, said its plans in­clude more in-store life­style of­fer­ings, ex­pe­ri­ences, and food and bev­er­age op­tions.</p>
    <p>It re­cently launched sev­eral pri­vate la­bels in ad­di­tion to an e-com­merce plat­form, and re­sponse so far has been en­cour­ag­ing, said BHG’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Jheeva Subra­ma­nian.</p>
    <p>He added: “Fun­da­men­tal chal­lenges still re­main, es­pe­cially foot­fall and con­sumer con­fi­dence. (But) we are op­ti­mistic that our rein­ven­tion strat­egy will help us adapt to the new re­tail norm.”</p>
