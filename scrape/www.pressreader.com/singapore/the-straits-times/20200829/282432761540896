    <p>• Af­ter months of un­cer­tainty in the ten­nis world, a wel­come devel­op­ment ar­rived on Thurs­day: the US Open draw. For many fans, the bracket for the tour­na­ment, which is set to be­gin on Mon­day, was con­fir­ma­tion that pro­fes­sional ten­nis is in­deed back.</p>
    <p>The draw has re­vealed the most com­pelling po­ten­tial match-ups and story lines of the tour­na­ment, aside from the big names that are miss­ing. The big­gest take­away is that No­vak Djokovic has a com­fort­able road ahead.</p>
    <p>With world No. 2 Rafael Nadal and 20-time Ma­jor cham­pion Roger Fed­erer not at this year’s US Open due to Covid-19 fears and knee surgery re­spec­tively, the world No. 1 has a rel­a­tively sim­ple path to the fi­nal. His hard­est po­ten­tial match-up is against the sev­enth-seeded David Gof­fin, who has beaten the 17-time Ma­jor win­ner just once in eight meet­ings, and that was in 2017 on clay.</p>
    <p>For the women, a gen­er­a­tional bat­tle looms. Ser­ena Wil­liams, who is seek­ing a record-ty­ing 24th Ma­jor sin­gles ti­tle, could run into Sloane Stephens, the 2017 US Open cham­pion, in the third round.</p>
    <p>This would be their first meet­ing since the 2015 French Open, and the 38-year-old Wil­liams, who has won five of their six head-to-head matches, will hope to push past Stephens, 27, as she pur­sues her first Ma­jor in over three years.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Open cham­pion Sofia Kenin, 21, faces an even tougher draw. In the round of 16, a Bel­gian in the form of Elise Mertens or Kim Cli­jsters, the 37-year-old play­ing her first Slam since 2012, will most likely be await­ing her. And her quar­ter-fi­nal op­po­nent could in­clude vet­er­ans Vic­to­ria Azarenka and Venus Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>There could also be a re­peat of last year’s third-round high­light be­tween 16-year-old Coco Gauff and two-time Ma­jor win­ner Naomi Osaka. The Ja­panese beat the Amer­i­can then, but lost to her in Mel­bourne in Jan­u­ary and the pair could get a re­match in the third round at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
