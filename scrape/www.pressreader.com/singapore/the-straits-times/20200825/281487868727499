    <p>The arts can bring cheer to se­niors, a group es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to Covid-19, when they may feel iso­lated at home. From the Sil­ver Arts fest go­ing dig­i­tal to a near-cen­te­nar­ian putting up his first vir­tual show, Life takes a look at how se­niors are ap­pre­ci­at­ing and cre­at­ing art in a time of the pan­demic</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Vivien Lee, 60, has been a vol­un­teer with the Sil­ver Arts fes­ti­val for the past five years. Things are dif­fer­ent this year, what with it hav­ing to go vir­tual due to the pan­demic, but she is still ex­cited to take part.</p>
    <p>So far, she has gone on a trial run of Vir­tual Jalan Jalan, a dig­i­tal tour of Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore led by artists Lee Sze-Chin and Moses Sia, and tried her hand at beat­box­ing in a work­shop with vet­eran singer Rahimah Rahim and beat­boxer Charles Stitch Wong.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never at­tempted beat­box­ing be­fore,” says Ms Lee, who used to work in broad­cast me­dia. “It’s some­thing we al­ways as­so­ciate with youth, but hey, se­niors can do it too. We just need a lit­tle more time to get it right.”</p>
    <p>The an­nual fes­ti­val by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC), now in its ninth edi­tion, cel­e­brates se­niors and cre­ative age­ing.</p>
    <p>It will run over two weeks from Sept 1 to 13 on the Sil­ver Arts Face­book page, with 15 pro­grammes – new ones re­leased every day at 2pm – in English, Man­darin, Malay, Tamil and Chi­nese di­alects. All of th­ese can be en­joyed on-screen from home.</p>
    <p>NAC se­nior di­rec­tor of en­gage­ment and par­tic­i­pa­tion Elaine Ng says in an e-mail in­ter­view: “From our ob­ser­va­tions and in­ter­ac­tions with Sil­ver Arts’ se­nior vol­un­teers, dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion may ap­pear to be daunt­ing at the start and a bar­rier to en­try for par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, as se­niors take the first step to be­gin their on­line arts jour­ney and fa­mil­iarise them­selves with tech­nol­ogy and new on­line plat­forms, many re­alise that there is a wide range of arts and cul­ture ac­tiv­i­ties and en­ter­tain­ment that is read­ily avail­able and easy to ac­cess.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “With the pan­demic, ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing se­niors, has had to adapt. Many have learnt to be more dig­i­tally savvy out of ne­ces­sity, to catch up with fam­ily mem­bers over video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­forms such as Zoom, or use QR codes for SafeEn­try at pub­lic venues.”</p>
    <p>The NAC en­gaged 30 se­nior vol­un­teers, in­clud­ing Ms Lee, as a test au­di­ence to make sure the up­com­ing pro­grammes are user-friendly. It is also pro­vid­ing the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of ser­vice as­so­ci­a­tion Lions Be­frien­ders with ac­cess to past Sil­ver Arts con­certs on MP3 play­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng says she hopes the dig­i­tal fes­ti­val will draw an at­ten­dance com­pa­ra­ble to that of phys­i­cal edi­tions, which usu­ally num­ber about 45,000 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>This year’s pro­grammes in­clude Keron­cong As­mara by Wadah Seni En­ter­tain­ment, a ro­man­tic per­for­mance of keron­cong (tra­di­tional Malay orches­tra); a homage to iconic singer Teresa Teng by Ding Yi Mu­sic Com­pany; and Ev­er­green Sym­phonic Juke­box, a fu­sion con­cert by the Asian Cul­tural Sym­phony Orches­tra.</p>
    <p>Hokkien songs from the 1970s will fea­ture in Toy Fac­tory Pro­duc­tions’ sto­ry­telling con­cert, Old Songs Of Redhill Mar­ket. Its chief artis­tic di­rec­tor Goh Boon Teck, 49, says in an e-mail in­ter­view: “As the mu­sic of our sil­ver gen­er­a­tion comes alive in our sto­ry­telling con­cert, we hope that th­ese mem­o­ries of their golden years will be passed down to peo­ple like you and me and also in­spire all of us to bond more closely across gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Apart from Sil­ver Arts, also on­go­ing now is Re­mem­ber When at</p>
    <p>The Arts House, a mono­logue writ­ing work­shop for se­niors. Though it is in its sixth edi­tion, this is the first time it will be con­ducted on­line.</p>
    <p>Over seven dig­i­tal ses­sions, the­atremaker Jef­frey Tan will lead par­tic­i­pants in cre­at­ing and block­ing a dra­matic mono­logue, which they will then per­form at an eighth ses­sion filmed at The Arts House Play Den in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Tan, 48, says there were many tech­ni­cal chal­lenges when in­tro­duc­ing the se­niors to Zoom in a trial run. “Some­times, we can see them, but we can’t hear them. Other times, we can hear them, but they can’t see us. I can see their frus­tra­tion. They re­ally want to be in­volved, but tech­nol­ogy is not their best friend.”</p>
    <p>But the par­tic­i­pants rose gamely to the chal­lenge, he adds.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous work­shops have shown him that writ­ing mono­logues based on their mem­o­ries can help se­niors dis­cover things about them­selves and one another, from a grand­mother show­ing off a photo of her younger self in a swim­ming cos­tume, to a cou­ple in an ar­ranged mar­riage hear­ing each other’s per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>“Sud­denly, their life sto­ries are given a win­dow to be shared and that’s al­ways nice for them to hear,” he says.</p>
