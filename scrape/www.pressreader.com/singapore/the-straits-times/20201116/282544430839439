    <p>•</p>
    <p>France handed de­fend­ing Na­tions League cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal a rare de­feat on Satur­day, winning 1-0 away to reach the com­pe­ti­tion’s fi­nal four at the ex­pense of the hold­ers.</p>
    <p>An­thony Mar­tial missed three clear-cut first-half chances be­fore N’Golo Kante’s sec­ond-half strike ended the hosts’ run of five suc­ces­sive clean sheets.</p>
    <p>World cham­pi­ons France went top of League A Group 3 with 13 points from five games, three ahead of Por­tu­gal and their bet­ter head-to-head record gives them an unas­sail­able lead.</p>
    <p>It was only the Sele­cao’s sec­ond de­feat since the 2018 World Cup, leav­ing Di­dier Deschamps thrilled with the state­ment vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“Given the qual­ity of the op­po­si­tion, it’s of course one of our best per­for­mances of re­cent times,” the France coach said of the Euro­pean cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>“We de­served the win and we’ve ful­filled our ob­jec­tive of fin­ish­ing top. I’m very proud of the play­ers. They proved tonight that France are still a great team.”</p>
    <p>An­toine Griez­mann set up Mar­tial’s first chance i n the 12th minute with a slide-rule pass but Por­tu­gal goal­keeper Rui Pa­tri­cio blocked it at point-blank range.</p>
    <p>Mar­tial then di­verted Adrien Rabiot’s ac­ro­batic ef­fort onto the bar with his head and saw an­other ef­fort bril­liantly saved.</p>
    <p>At the other end, cap­tain Cris­tiano Ronaldo, who is seven goals short of equalling the all-time in­ter­na­tional record held by Iran great Ali Daei (109), forced a div­ing save from France cap­tain Hugo Lloris and also wasted a free kick by driv­ing straight into the wall.</p>
    <p>France fi­nally broke through just as Por­tu­gal ap­peared to be im­pos­ing them­selves, with Kante on hand to score from the re­bound after Rabiot’s shot was par­ried, net­ting just his sec­ond in­ter­na­tional goal and his first since 2016.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal had chances to equalise in the sec­ond half but Jose Fonte’s header struck the post, while Lloris had to make a one-handed save to parry a rak­ing drive from Joao Moutinho, as the vis­i­tors held out at the Es­ta­dio da Luz.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what went wrong in the first half, it wasn’t what I ex­pected but it was my re­spon­si­bil­ity,” said Por­tu­gal coach Fer­nando San­tos.</p>
    <p>“We were bet­ter in the sec­ond half but then con­ceded the goal which set­tled the game... we had three or four chances to equalise.”</p>
    <p>Deschamps’ men are the first team to ad­vance to the knock­out stage, which Uefa has pen­cilled in for next Oc­to­ber.</p>
