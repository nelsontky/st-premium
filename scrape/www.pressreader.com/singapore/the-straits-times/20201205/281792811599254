    <p>CHIT­TAGONG • Bangladesh trans­ported more than 1,600 Ro­hingya refugees to a low-ly­ing is­land yes­ter­day, in the first phase of a con­tro­ver­sial planned re­lo­ca­tion of 100,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Al­most a mil­lion Ro­hingya – most of whom fled a mil­i­tary of­fen­sive in neigh­bour­ing Myan­mar in 2017 – live in squalid camps in south-east­ern Bangladesh. Any re­turn to Myan­mar ap­pears un­likely for now.</p>
    <p>Dhaka wants to move 100,000 of the refugees to Bhashan Char, a silt is­land that crit­ics say is prone to flood­ing and in the path of cy­clones that fre­quently wreak havoc in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Rights groups have al­leged that many of those sent in the first wave yes­ter­day were co­erced into go­ing.</p>
    <p>This was borne out by some fam­ily mem­bers that AFP spoke to at the con­gested camps in the Cox’s Bazar dis­trict on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“They beat my son mer­ci­lessly and even smashed his teeth so that he agreed to go to the is­land,” said Ms Su­fia Khatun, 60, who came to see off her son and other rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>But Bangladesh’s For­eign Min­is­ter A.K. Ab­dul Mo­men called the claims “a damn lie”, and said the fa­cil­i­ties on the is­land were “much bet­ter” than in the camps.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh has spent some US$400 mil­lion (S$533 mil­lion) from its own cof­fers build­ing shel­ters and a 3m flood em­bank­ment around the fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Those taken there will be al­lo­cated rooms and given house­hold equip­ment to cook on their own, al­low­ing them to start a new life, of­fi­cials say.</p>
    <p>But it is un­clear what health­care or ed­u­ca­tional fa­cil­i­ties there will be on the is­land.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions High Com­mis­sioner for Refugees called on Bangladesh to up­hold its com­mit­ment that re­lo­ca­tion of Ro­hingya to the is­land will be vol­un­tary, spokesman Babar Baloch told a UN brief­ing in Geneva yes­ter­day.</p>
