    <p>Ja­pan and In­done­sia are strength­en­ing their se­cu­rity ties through mea­sures such as ex­pe­dit­ing talks on the ex­port of Ja­panese de­fence tech­nol­ogy and by hav­ing their de­fence and for­eign min­is­ters meet soon.</p>
    <p>This re­flects con­cerns over grow­ing Chi­nese re­gional as­sertive­ness, and comes as Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga met In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo at the Pres­i­den­tial Palace in Bo­gor, south of Jakarta, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who is the first for­eign leader to visit In­done­sia since the Covid-19 pan­demic, was greeted with a 19-gun salute.</p>
    <p>He flew in from Viet­nam, and Ja­panese diplo­mats said the four-day, two-na­tion trip was meant to sym­bol­ise Ja­pan’s con­tin­ued com­mit­ment to and sup­port for Asean.</p>
    <p>Re­garded as a green­horn when it comes to for­eign af­fairs, Mr Suga is fol­low­ing in the foot­steps of his pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe, who also vis­ited Viet­nam and In­done­sia first af­ter he be­came prime min­is­ter in De­cem­ber 2012.</p>
    <p>A key pri­or­ity for Mr Suga is to ce­ment Asean’s back­ing for Ja­pan’s Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion, which he stressed is aligned with the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pa­cific pi­o­neered by In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The Asean ini­tia­tive is built on prin­ci­ples such as trans­parency and re­spect for in­ter­na­tional law, with the bloc “be­ing an hon­est bro­ker within the strate­gic en­vi­ron­ment of com­pet­ing in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga told a news con­fer­ence, with Mr Joko be­side him, that their de­fence and for­eign min­is­ters will meet in the near fu­ture un­der the so-called two-plus-two frame­work.</p>
    <p>This will be the first meet­ing be­tween the min­is­ters since 2015, and In­done­sia is the only Asean na­tion with which Ja­pan has a two-plustwo ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko said that closer co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Ja­pan and In­done­sia was crit­i­cal amid the “in­creas­ingly sharp ri­val­ries be­tween the world’s great pow­ers”, al­lud­ing to the in­ten­si­fy­ing clash be­tween the United States and China.</p>
    <p>But he added that he hoped the South China Sea will “con­tinue to be peace­ful and sta­ble”.</p>
    <p>A day ear­lier, in Hanoi, Mr Suga agreed in prin­ci­ple to a mil­i­tary equip­ment and tech­nol­ogy ex­port pact with his Viet­namese coun­ter­part Nguyen Xuan Phuc.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is one of the claimants in ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes over the South China Sea. Although In­done­sia is not a claimant state in the dis­pute, its ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone over­laps with China’s “nine-dash line” blan­ket claim over large swathes of the wa­ter­way. Ja­pan is also en­cour­ag­ing its com­pa­nies to di­ver­sify their sup­ply chains so as to re­duce their reliance on China, with the risk of con­cen­trat­ing fac­to­ries in a sin­gle mar­ket hav­ing been made ev­i­dent by the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko said he ap­pre­ci­ated the in­vest­ments made by Ja­pan, which is re­garded in In­done­sian cir­cles as a strate­gic eco­nomic part­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga vowed to pro­mote co­op­er­a­tion in in­fra­struc­ture projects, such as mass rapid tran­sit, the Jakarta-Surabaya semi-fast train, the con­struc­tion of the Pa­tim­ban port, as well as work­ing to­gether to in­crease eco­nomic re­silience.</p>
    <p>He also com­mit­ted 50 bil­lion yen (S$642.44 mil­lion) in long-term, low-in­ter­est loans to In­done­sia to help it cope with the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has been the worst hit in South-east Asia, with more than 360,000 con­firmed cases and more than 12,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>The loan amount is on top of an ear­lier 50 bil­lion yen, pledged through the Ja­pan In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion Agency in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese and In­done­sian lead­ers also agreed to be­gin talks on a travel cor­ri­dor for busi­ness trav­ellers, as well as to re­sume travel for nurses and care worker trainees.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga re­turns to Tokyo today.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo said that closer co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Ja­pan and In­done­sia was crit­i­cal amid the “in­creas­ingly sharp ri­val­ries be­tween the world’s great pow­ers”, al­lud­ing to the in­ten­si­fy­ing clash be­tween the United States and China.</p>
