    <p>While I ap­plaud the Gov­ern­ment in its ef­forts to tackle the Covid-19 pan­demic and ed­u­cate the na­tion, I have no­ticed in­con­sis­ten­cies in the mea­sures be­ing im­ple­mented to en­sure safety for every­one.</p>
    <p>It is not un­com­mon to see crowded malls, cof­fee shops and hawker cen­tres on week­ends, yet many co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties (CCAs) and group sports are still bound by very strict restric­tions and are mostly be­ing con­ducted on­line or re­main can­celled.</p>
    <p>Schools are cur­rently con­duct­ing per­form­ing arts CCAs, like those in­volv­ing mu­si­cal in­stru­ments and some sports classes, via video con­fer­enc­ing, which is def­i­nitely not an ef­fec­tive learn­ing en­vi­ron­ment for both the chil­dren and the coaches.</p>
    <p>The screens on per­sonal de­vices are limited in size and in­ef­fec­tive for train­ers/learn­ers to watch every­one in one glance.</p>
    <p>It is dif­fi­cult to mon­i­tor psy­cho-mo­tor skills this way.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tion of only four play­ers per court for bad­minton or tennis has also im­peded the com­mence­ment of racket train­ing for chil­dren in schools.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, I have seen taek­wondo lessons be­ing con­ducted at com­mu­nity cen­tres.</p>
    <p>It is puz­zling when one sees crowded hawker cen­tres and gath­er­ings of 50 peo­ple be­ing al­lowed, but bad­minton or tennis lessons for more than four per­sons, up to 10 peo­ple, are still not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve schools should have the re­sources and space to en­sure, for ex­am­ple, an orches­tra CCA can be con­ducted safely with suf­fi­cient safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>I urge the Covid-19 min­is­te­rial task force to review the poli­cies for non-con­tact group CCAs to re­sume in school so long as safety mea­sures can be un­der­taken by the schools, re­gard­less of whether na­tional level sport/cul­tural/art events or com­pe­ti­tions are be­ing held.</p>
    <p>We should not have a gen­er­a­tion of stu­dents whose crit­i­cal devel­op­ment in sports or cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties is lost.</p>
