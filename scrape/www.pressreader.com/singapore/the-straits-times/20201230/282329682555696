    <p>DEN­VER • The Hous­ton Rock­ets are not in ac­tion to­day but their prac­tice ses­sion will be a big step towards nor­mal­ity for the short­handed team.</p>
    <p>Nikola Jo­kic racked up his 43rd ca­reer triple-dou­ble – 19 points, 18 as­sists and 12 re­bounds – while Ja­mal Mur­ray added 21 points as the Den­ver Nuggets beat Hous­ton 124-111 on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Like their pre­vi­ous Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion game (NBA), the Rock­ets played with just nine play­ers – one above the league min­i­mum – avail­able due to coro­n­avirus is­sues.</p>
    <p>Re­serve duo Ben McLe­more and Kenyon Martin Jr will not be avail­able for their next game to­mor­row at home to the Sacra­mento Kings as both are self-iso­lat­ing after test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 last week.</p>
    <p>But cru­cially, De­Mar­cus Cousins, John Wall, Eric Gor­don and Ma­son Jones are out of quar­an­tine to­day and will im­me­di­ately re­turn to the fold.</p>
    <p>Cousins, Wall and Gor­don are all con­sid­ered to be starters, and Stephen Si­las, the Rock­ets’ rookie coach, is des­per­ate to wel­come the quar­tet back after two losses in as many open­ing games.</p>
    <p>“Wed­nes­day’s prac­tice is an important prac­tice, get­ting these guys back in and get­ting the group on the same page,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is a grow­ing, learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence for all of us and we have to get better, on the de­fen­sive end es­pe­cially.</p>
    <p>“When you have nine guys, and you are kind of do­ing things on the fly be­cause you don’t have prac­tice time, it can get ugly against a good team and that’s what hap­pened tonight.”</p>
    <p>James Har­den, the NBA scor­ing cham­pion for the past three terms, had 34 points, while team­mate Chris­tian Wood scored 23.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the vis­i­tors had no an­swer to the hosts, with All-Star Jo­kic a par­tic­u­lar menace with his play­mak­ing. The Ser­bian cen­tre, whose team got off the mark with their first win in three games, said: “I just play like that, try­ing to find the open guy. My coaches gave me the free­dom to do that.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Chi­nese stream­ing gi­ant Ten­cent has stopped live broad­casts of games by the Philadel­phia 76ers in ap­par­ent protest at their new pres­i­dent Daryl Morey, who sparked a row by voic­ing sup­port for Hong Kong pro­test­ers last year.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent has been of­fer­ing only text up­dates for Six­ers games as well as those in­volv­ing the Rock­ets, Morey’s for­mer em­ploy­ers. It also re­fused to screen Rock­ets games last sea­son.</p>
