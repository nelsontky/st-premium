    <p>A man driv­ing a van felt sleepy and nod­ded off at the wheel, caus­ing his ve­hi­cle to hit a taxi.</p>
    <p>Cabby Glenn Chan­dra Moghan Ku­maran, 45, went to Sengkang Gen­eral Hospi­tal the next day, and he was found to have in­juries that in­cluded ten­der­ness over his right wrist and lower back pain.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent may have also ag­gra­vated his ex­ist­ing cer­vi­cal spondy­lo­sis – a gen­eral de­gen­er­a­tion of the spine.</p>
    <p>The van driver, Neo Teck Han, was given a max­i­mum fine of $2,500 yesterday af­ter plead­ing guilty to caus­ing hurt to Mr Glenn by driv­ing in a neg­li­gent man­ner.</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old Sin­ga­porean</p>
    <p>was also dis­qual­i­fied from driv­ing all classes of ve­hi­cles for a year.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Mark Yeo said that Neo was driv­ing a van along the third lane of Lower Delta Road at around 2.30pm on May 3 last year when he felt sleepy and dozed off.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, he failed to keep proper con­trol of his ve­hi­cle and it veered to­wards the left be­fore hit­ting the rear of Mr Glenn’s taxi.</p>
    <p>The court heard that shortly be­fore the ac­ci­dent, the cabby had stopped his taxi at a bus stop near Teresa Ville con­do­minium and switched on its haz­ard lights to in­di­cate that it was sta­tion­ary.</p>
    <p>It was not men­tioned why he had stopped the taxi there.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his van hit the taxi, Neo got out of his ve­hi­cle and alerted the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The DPP said that at the time of the ac­ci­dent, the weather was fine, the road sur­face was dry, vis­i­bil­ity was clear and traf­fic flow was mod­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Mr Glenn was given 14 days of med­i­cal leave.</p>
    <p>For caus­ing hurt by neg­li­gent driv­ing, an of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $2,500.</p>
