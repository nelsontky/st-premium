    <p>LON­DON • Arse­nal travel to Rapid Vi­enna to­day as they kick off their fourth sea­son i n the Europa League, but one no­table player will not be on board the team plane for the Group B opener.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing the high­est-paid player in the club’s his­tory on a re­ported £350,000 (S$623,000) a week, Me­sut Ozil has been left out of the Gun­ners’ Premier League and Europa League squads.</p>
    <p>His omis­sion comes as no sur­prise, hav­ing failed to play a sin­gle minute for man­ager Mikel Arteta since March 7, but he had held out hope that he could some­how get back into the team.</p>
    <p>But with his ax­ing con­firmed, the for­mer Ger­many mid­fielder yes­ter­day hit out at the club’s treat­ment amid reports he will never play another game again, with his con­tract ex­pir­ing next June.</p>
    <p>“This is a dif­fi­cult mes­sage to write to the Arse­nal fans that I’ve played for over the past few years,” said the 32-year-old in a state­ment posted on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally deeply dis­ap­pointed by the fact that I have not been reg­is­tered for the Premier League sea­son for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>“Upon sign­ing my new con­tract in 2018, I pledged my loy­alty and al­le­giance to the club that I love, Arse­nal, and it sad­dens me that this has not been re­cip­ro­cated.”</p>
    <p>Along­side Greece de­fender Sokratis Pa­pas­tathopou­los – also left out of both squads – Ozil will now only be able to rep­re­sent the Un­der-23s.</p>
    <p>North Lon­don ri­vals Tot­ten­ham are also in Europa League ac­tion to­day when they host Aus­tria’s Lask.</p>
    <p>Spurs have en­joyed Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball for four suc­ces­sive sea­sons, and if they are to re­turn to the elite, the play­ers must im­prove their de­fend­ing.</p>
    <p>Man­ager Jose Mour­inho yes­ter­day in­sisted that the last-gasp 3-3 Premier League draw with West Ham, who came back from 3-0 down with eight min­utes left, was “not go­ing to hap­pen again”.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to be stick­ing on this and no sto­ries about ‘Spursy’ and this kind of thing,” he said. “We just need to de­fend bet­ter from set pieces.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Me&#xAD;sut Ozil (right) and Arse&#xAD;nal club mas&#xAD;cot Gun&#xAD;ner&#xAD;saurus are two fig&#xAD;ures who will not be in&#xAD;volved in a match for the con&#xAD;sid&#xAD;er&#xAD;able fu&#xAD;ture. Ozil has been left out of the club&#x2019;s Premier League and Europa League squads, while the di&#xAD;nosaur mas&#xAD;cot was axed as a cost-sav&#xAD;ing mea&#xAD;sure, be&#xAD;fore Ozil of&#xAD;fered to cover the salary of Jerry Quy, the man who has been play&#xAD;ing Gun&#xAD;ner&#xAD;saurus for the past 27 years.</p>
