    <p>It is hard to over­state the sig­nif­i­cance, both in the United States and glob­ally, of the election not just of 77-year-old Joe Bi­den but also of Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris, 56.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Party is in des­per­ate need of gen­er­a­tional change. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is 80. Se­nate Mi­nor­ity Leader Chuck Schumer is 69.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris is the face of that change, and fur­ther­more in sync with the real face of the US in 2020.</p>
    <p>The US’ de­mo­graph­ics are shift­ing. Its white pop­u­la­tion is age­ing and slow-grow­ing. Cen­sus pro­jec­tions es­ti­mate that by 2045, whites will com­prise 49.7 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion along­side 24.6 per cent His­pan­ics, 13.1 per cent blacks, 7.9 per cent Asians and 3.8 per cent mul­tira­cial peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Both in sub­stance and in op­tics, the new duo in the White House will send a strong sig­nal – of an Amer­ica that is in­creas­ingly di­verse, and one that should be com­fort­able in that di­ver­sity be­cause it is the re­al­ity of the idea</p>
    <p>of the US, a coun­try of im­mi­grants.</p>
    <p>The age­ing Mr Bi­den is in a sense tran­si­tional, a bridge from his gen­er­a­tion’s more com­fort­able past to the ex­cit­ing fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly that com­fort with the new or­der is not shared by all. “Ka­mala Har­ris as pres­i­dent? No, no,” one Don­ald Trump sup­porter told me, shak­ing his head em­phat­i­cally as he bought a “Make Amer­ica Great” T-shirt at a road­side stall out­side a pre-election Trump rally at a ru­ral air­port in North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Apart from the im­me­di­ate chal­lenges of gover­nance – the Covid-19 pan­demic tops the list – Mr Bi­den and Ms Har­ris face the chal­lenge of heal­ing a na­tion at odds with it­self.</p>
    <p>Over the past four years, the im­age of the US has taken a bash­ing. A re­cent Pew sur­vey of sev­eral de­vel­oped coun­tries found that a ma­jor­ity of re­spon­dents had a dim opin­ion of China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping – and an even lower opin­ion of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Divi­sions ex­ac­er­bated within the US. Ran­dom, racist ha­rass­ment of Asian-Amer­i­cans has in­creased, white su­prem­a­cist groups have be­come em­bold­ened, cul­tural di­vides be­tween cos­mopoli­tan ur­ban cen­tres and ru­ral Amer­ica have be­come chasms.</p>
    <p>A coun­try at odds with it­self can­not project moral clar­ity,</p>
    <p>strength and con­fi­dence over­seas – some­thing all the more vi­tal if that coun­try hap­pens to be a su­per­power.</p>
    <p>The fact that the US demo­cratic process has proven re­silient is en­cour­ag­ing. The voter turnout was per­haps the high­est since 1900.</p>
    <p>“Amer­i­can vot­ers have shown that de­spite all the crazi­ness of the US sys­tem, the demo­cratic process seems to have pulled through,” says Mr Curtis Chin, Milken In­sti­tute Asia Fel­low and a for­mer am­bas­sador to the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den’s prin­ci­pal</p>
    <p>task, do­mes­ti­cally, is heal­ing, says Dr Glenn Altschuler, pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can Stud­ies at Cor­nell University, specif­i­cally fo­cus­ing on the pan­demic, health­care and more gen­er­ally the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­na­tion­ally, the prin­ci­pal task is re­pair – of re­la­tion­ships with al­lies and friends for decades and decades; of per­cep­tions of the US and the im­age of the US among peo­ple of colour in Africa, in Asia.</p>
    <p>“And that re­pair... and it will not be easy but I think it’s pos­si­ble, will per­haps para­dox­i­cally, in­crease the es­teem that Amer­i­cans have about their own coun­try.”</p>
    <p>He added that an “iso­la­tion­ist coun­try in a global world feels de­fen­sive”.</p>
    <p>“A coun­try that un­der­stands how to pro­mote its in­ter­ests while... hav­ing the re­spect of other na­tions, as the US typ­i­cally has, is a na­tion that can feel good about it­self.”</p>
    <p>Re­act­ing to Mr Bi­den’s Satur­day night speech, Stan­ford University pro­fes­sor Larry Di­a­mond tweeted: “Joe Bi­den just gave the best speech of his life – an in­spir­ing con­trast to four years of di­vi­sion and degra­da­tion, begin­ning to heal our democ­racy.”</p>
    <p>It is a moun­tain to climb, but Mr Bi­den and Ms Har­ris may be the right pair at the right time, at least to be­gin the process of work­ing to­wards the prom­ise.</p>
    <p>It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the tem­per­a­ture, see each other again, lis­ten to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treat­ing our op­po­nents as en­e­mies.</p>
