    <p>So vic­tory in the Eifel Grand Prix at the Nur­bur­gring on Sun­day fi­nally brought Lewis Hamil­ton level with Michael Schu­macher’s record of 91 vic­to­ries. It could not have hap­pened at a more ap­po­site venue, with the lat­ter’s home town of Ker­pen just 85km to the north. And in a mov­ing lit­tle bit of Covid-de­fy­ing cer­e­mony, his rac­ing son Mick pre­sented Hamil­ton with one of his fa­ther’s hel­mets.</p>
    <p>Only re­cently, the folly of try­ing to com­pare driv­ers of dif­fer­ent eras was ex­posed as friends marked the 50th an­niver­sary of the death of Jochen Rindt, the sport’s only post­hu­mous world cham­pion. With­out ques­tion he was a match for his close friend and thrice cham­pion Jackie Ste­wart, yet while the Scot would cer­tainly make any list of 20 all-time greats, Rindt prob­a­bly would not.</p>
    <p>So where does Hamil­ton rank among them?</p>
    <p>For some, vic­to­ries are all that mat­ter. But do their 91 wins mean that Schu­macher and Hamil­ton are so far ahead of leg­ends such as Alain Prost on 51, and Ayr­ton Senna on</p>
    <p>41? And, if so, where does that leave other giants such as Ste­wart on 27, Jim Clark on 25, Juan Manuel Fan­gio on 24 or Stir­ling Moss on 16?</p>
    <p>Judg­ments tend to be based on so many dif­fer­ent fac­tors, be­yond the tally of wins and world cham­pi­onships, for in a sport where tech­nol­ogy plays such an in­creas­ingly key part, so many dif­fer­ent fac­tors are in­flu­encers of suc­cess. Driv­ers to­day, thank­fully, live in an era when se­ri­ous in­jury, let alone death, is mer­ci­fully rare, whereas back in the eras of Fan­gio, Moss and Clark, death was a fre­quent co-driver.</p>
    <p>Thus, judg­ments tend to be very per­sonal. Two of my heroes are the lit­tle-re­mem­bered French­man Ray­mond “Coeur de lion” Som­mer, and the mer­cu­rial French-Cana­dian Gilles Villeneuve, both of whom died in rac­ing ac­ci­dents. Each raced for the love of it, with grace, courage and the im­pla­ca­ble be­lief that what mat­tered was the man­ner in which you played the game. Nei­ther had re­ally good cars, yet they drove the wheels off what­ever they had with the chivalry and hon­our of knights of old. Just like Moss, Clark, Ste­wart, Rindt and Prost did.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, such as Senna and Schu­macher, sought vic­tory so pas­sion­ately that they suc­cumbed to moments of un­ac­cept­able ag­gres­sion that tainted their suc­cesses be­cause they were tal­ented enough not to need to re­sort to un­der­hand, bul­ly­ing tac­tics at the ex­pense of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>For me, Hamil­ton’s legacy is one of hon­our and a re­lent­less yet bru­tally hon­est com­mit­ment to self-im­prove­ment, never giv­ing up, and al­ways bounc­ing back from ev­ery set­back and turn­ing it some­how into mo­ti­va­tion for his next suc­cess. Not for noth­ing is he a dis­ci­ple of Maya An­gelou’s poem Still I Rise.</p>
    <p>Yes, he gets into mud­dles some­times. His praise one year in Rus­sia of Vladimir Putin raised many eye­brows; in 2008 he sim­ply drove into the back of Kimi Raikko­nen’s sta­tion­ary Fer­rari on the exit to the pit road in Mon­treal when he failed to spot the red light; and last year he in­ad­ver­tently nudged Alex Al­bon into a spin in the fi­nal laps in Brazil. But fun­da­men­tally he drives the way Clark did, with im­pec­ca­ble man­ners and the in­tent of do­ing the job cleanly and sport­ingly.</p>
    <p>And where Schu­macher used to have clauses in his con­tract guar­an­tee­ing him No. 1 sta­tus and pre­vent­ing team­mates from chal­leng­ing him, Hamil­ton has al­ways rel­ished the on-track bat­tle, and been happy to race fast team­mates such as Fer­nando Alonso, Heikki Ko­valainen, Jen­son But­ton, Nico Ros­berg and Valt­teri Bot­tas.</p>
    <p>And the sport is very dif­fer­ent to­day to that which Fan­gio, Clark and even Ste­wart ex­pe­ri­enced, as the sheer cost gen­er­ates mas­sive pres­sures and ex­pec­ta­tions far in ex­cess of pre­vi­ous eras.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s po­lit­i­cal ex­ploita­tion of his fame isn’t uni­ver­sally pop­u­lar, but as a lone suc­cess­ful black man in a global sport, he feels a keen re­spon­si­bil­ity to use his voice in sup­port of his be­liefs. And he clearly doesn’t like los­ing, but which true cham­pion ever does?</p>
    <p>Some call him a Mar­mite sports­man (loved or loathed in equal mea­sure), but he has tran­scended his sport and those who know him well ap­plaud and savour an hon­est legacy of speed, com­mit­ment and hon­our that promises yet more to come.</p>
    <p>Driv­ers to­day, thank­fully, live in an era when se­ri­ous in­jury, let alone death, is mer­ci­fully rare, whereas back in the eras of Fan­gio, Moss and Clark, death was a fre­quent co-driver.</p>
