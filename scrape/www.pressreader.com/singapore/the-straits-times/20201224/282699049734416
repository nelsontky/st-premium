    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • It has taken Hol­ly­wood star Tom Hanks (left) more than 35 years to make his first western, so when he fi­nally got on a horse and i nto a shoot-out, he wanted to make sure the movie had some­thing spe­cial to say.</p>
    <p>Hanks, known for play­ing nice guys, stars in News Of The World, out in Amer­i­can movie theatres to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>He joked that he likes to think of the film as “The Man­dalo­rian, with­out lightsaber­s”.</p>
    <p>“There’s no rea­son to make a western just be­cause you get to wear com­fort­able clothes and a hat. It has to be about some­thing big­ger than just the genre,” Hanks, 64, said.</p>
    <p>Set af­ter the United States Civil War, the film fol­lows Cap­tain Jef­fer­son Kyle Kidd (Hanks) as he trav­els across a di­vided Amer­ica read­ing the news in small towns.</p>
    <p>He meets a trau­ma­tised girl, played by new­comer He­lena Zen­gel, who was taken by the Na­tive Amer­i­can Kiowa tribe years ago and de­cides to de­liver her back to her sur­viv­ing rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>For Hanks and di­rec­tor Paul Green­grass, News Of The World is about the power of heal­ing af­ter frac­tious events.</p>
    <p>“It felt to me such a con­tem­po­rary story – the world bit­terly di­vided, (the) post-Civil War land­scape, the des­per­ate de­sire for heal­ing but not know­ing what the road to heal­ing looks like,” said Green­grass, who has pre­vi­ously worked with Hanks on the 2013 movie Cap­tain Phillips.</p>
    <p>Although the filming of News Of The World took place more than a year ago, the story takes place against a back­ground of the epi­demics of cholera and menin­gi­tis that hit the US in the late 19th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Hanks said the eerily pre­scient ar­rival of the film this week dur­ing the long coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the af­ter­math of di­vi­sive US elec­tions last month re­flects the power of movie-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>“Here we are, we made a movie that takes place in 1870 and it speaks to 2020. Ain’t that the movies in a nut­shell?” he said.</p>
    <p>“That you can see a film that is about peo­ple rid­ing horses and it’s like, ‘ Wow. That’s re­ally speak­ing about what it’s like to­day.’”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hanks said on the To­day talk show that he and his wife, ac­tress Rita Wil­son, look for­ward to tak­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine, but they will do so af­ter “ev­ery­body who truly needs to get it”.</p>
    <p>Hanks and Wil­son, also 64, were among the first celebri­ties to an­nounce in March that they had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus while he was filming in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The For­rest Gump (1994) star told To­day host Sa­van­nah Guthrie: “It was a tough 10 days, but I think what’s much more im­por­tant is the sec­ond half of the Covid-19 for­mula, that we didn’t give it to any­body.”</p>
    <p>He added that he and Wil­son are still wear­ing face masks as part of pre­cau­tions.</p>
