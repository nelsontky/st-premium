    <p>MALAGA (Spain) • At mid­day on Sun­day, there were 31 pa­tients in­side the main coro­n­avirus treat­ment cen­tre in Malaga, the city with the fastest-ris­ing in­fec­tion rate in south­ern Spain. At 12.15pm, the 32nd ar­rived in an am­bu­lance. Half an hour later came num­ber 33.</p>
    <p>The rub­bish bin by the door over­flowed with masks and blue sur­gi­cal gloves. Rel­a­tives hov­ered in si­lence out­side the cen­tre – one of them in tears, an­other feel­ing a pang of deja-vu.</p>
    <p>“My brother-in-law had the virus in t he spring,” said Ms Ju­lia Bautista, a 58-year-old re­tired of­fice ad­min­is­tra­tor wait­ing for news of her 91-year-old father.</p>
    <p>“Here we go again,” she added. If Italy was the har­bin­ger of the first wave of Europe’s coro­n­avirus pan­demic in Fe­bru­ary, Spain is the por­tent of its se­cond.</p>
    <p>France is also see­ing a surge in cases, as are parts of East­ern Europe, and cases are tick­ing up in Ger­many, Greece, Italy and Bel­gium, too, but in the past week, Spain has recorded the most num­ber of new cases on the con­ti­nent by far – more than 53,000.</p>
    <p>With 114 new in­fec­tions per 100,000 peo­ple in that time, the virus is spread­ing faster in Spain than in the United States, more than twice as fast as in France, about eight times the rate in Italy and Bri­tain, and 10 times the pace in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Spain was al­ready one of the hard­est-hit coun­tries in Europe, and now has about 440,000 cases and more than 29,000 deaths. But af­ter one of the world’s most strin­gent lock­downs, which did check the virus’ spread, it then en­joyed one of the most rapid re­open­ings. The re­turn of nightlife and group ac­tiv­i­ties – far faster than most of its Euro­pean neigh­bours – has con­trib­uted to the epi­demic’s resur­gence.</p>
    <p>Now, as other Euro­peans mull over how to restart their economies while still pro­tect­ing hu­man life, the Span­ish have be­come an early bell­wether for how a se­cond wave might hap­pen, how hard it might hit, and how it could be con­tained.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps Spain is the ca­nary in the coal mine,” said Pro­fes­sor An­toni Trilla, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at the Barcelona In­sti­tute for Global Health, a re­search group. “Many coun­tries may fol­low us – but hope­fully not at the same speed or with the same num­ber of cases that we are fac­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ex­pla­na­tions for the surge in­clude large fam­ily gath­er­ings, the re­turn of tourism in cities like Malaga, the de­ci­sion to re­turn re­spon­si­bil­ity for fight­ing the virus to re­gional au­thor­i­ties at the end of the na­tion­wide lock­down, a lack of ad­e­quate hous­ing and health­care for mi­grants and the re­vival of nightlife.</p>
    <p>To be sure, doc­tors and politi­cians are not as ter­ri­fied by Spain’s se­cond wave as they were by its first. The mor­tal­ity rate is roughly half the rate at the height of the cri­sis – fall­ing to 6.6 per cent from the 12 per cent peak in May.</p>
    <p>The me­dian age of suf­fer­ers has fallen to around 37 from 60. Asymp­to­matic cases ac­count for more than 50 per cent of pos­i­tive re­sults, which is partly due to a four­fold rise in test­ing. And the health in­sti­tu­tions feel much bet­ter pre­pared.</p>
    <p>“We have ex­pe­ri­ence now,” said Dr Maria del Mar Vazquez, the med­i­cal di­rec­tor of the hospi­tal in Malaga where Ms Bautista’s father was be­ing treated.</p>
    <p>“We have a much big­ger stock of equip­ment, we have pro­to­cols in place, we are more pre­pared,” Dr Vazquez said. “The hos­pi­tals will be full – but we are ready.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional co­or­di­na­tion has also im­proved while test­ing speeds are ac­cel­er­at­ing – in Malaga, the big­gest hospi­tal can process tests within a sin­gle morn­ing, thanks to the re­cent pur­chase of a se­ries of ro­bots.</p>
    <p>“It’s not like the first wave,” said Ms Car­men Cerezo, 38, a train at­ten­dant wait­ing out­side the Malaga hospi­tal while her father was tested for coro­n­avirus in­side.</p>
    <p>“We’re calmer now,” she said.</p>
