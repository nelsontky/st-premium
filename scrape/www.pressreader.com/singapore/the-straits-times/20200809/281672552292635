    <p>Let’s face it: Things won’t be get­ting bet­ter any time soon.</p>
    <p>The stark warn­ing from global health ex­perts comes af­ter July yielded nearly as many new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions as the first six months of the pan­demic put to­gether – and the curve con­tin­ues edg­ing steadily up­wards.</p>
    <p>More than eight mil­lion new Covid-19 cases were recorded last month, with num­bers doubling every six weeks. The global to­tal now stands at nearly 20 mil­lion, and over 700,000 peo­ple have died of the dis­ease world­wide. Au­gust does not bode any bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing I have seen so far makes me op­ti­mistic,” pub­lic health strate­gist Bill Bowtell, an ad­junct pro­fes­sor at the Uni­ver­sity of New South Wales in Aus­tralia, told The Sun­day Times. “Glob­ally, we are still in the first wave and there is lit­tle sign of abate­ment.” The pes­simistic out­look has Prof Bowtell ad­vo­cat­ing a more am­bi­tious strat­egy in curb­ing the pan­demic – striv­ing for elim­i­na­tion of the virus, rather than merely try­ing to keep num­bers low.</p>
    <p>One in every four in­fected in July was from the United States, which re­ported a record 1.87 mil­lion cases last month, more than dou­ble its pre­vi­ous record month in April. Brazil saw 1.2 mil­lion in­fec­tions last month out of its cur­rent to­tal of nearly three mil­lion, while In­dia saw 1.1 mil­lion cases of its two mil­lion tally.</p>
    <p>The fresh surges in the Amer­i­cas and South Asia came even be­fore the re­gions wit­nessed any no­table de­cline in their epi­demics de­spite scat­tered lock­downs. Other coun­tries in Europe and the Asia-Pa­cific saw spikes from new out­breaks af­ter ini­tial suc­cess in con­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>ASIA’S CAU­TION­ARY TALES</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines be­came South-east Asia’s lat­est coro­n­avirus epi­cen­tre last week as its cases soared above 120,000 and its sprawl­ing cap­i­tal of Manila and sur­round­ing ar­eas went back un­der lock­down. The coun­try had emerged from one of the world’s strictest and long­est lock­downs only in June, as Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte sought to restart the econ­omy that was spi­ralling into its deep­est re­ces­sion ever.</p>
    <p>But as peo­ple re­turned to nor­mal life al­most im­me­di­ately, in­fec­tions quickly rose again, from a sev­en­day aver­age of 600 on June 1 to more than 4,200 on Fri­day. Yesterday, it re­ported an­other 4,131 new cases and 41 deaths.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam, which had gone 100 days with­out com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion and had not seen a sin­gle Covid-19 death ini­tially, de­tected its lat­est out­break in the cen­tral city of Danang in late July. In the span of a fort­night, the out­break has spread to 13 cities and prov­inces, in­clud­ing the ur­ban cen­tres of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and led to over 300 new cases and 10 deaths. Its source re­mains un­clear.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, a nascent clus­ter of cases that orig­i­nated from a restau­rant owner, who had re­turned to Kedah from In­dia and failed to fol­low quar­an­tine rules, has spread to neigh­bour­ing Perlis and Pe­nang states, in­fect­ing about a dozen peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, which had ear­lier been lauded for its suc­cess­ful model of lim­ited test­ing and lack of lock­downs and le­gal en­force­ment, is also fac­ing an ag­gres­sive resur­gence of the virus that has spread rapidly from its cap­i­tal of Tokyo to other ur­ban ar­eas and from younger, health­ier peo­ple to the el­derly over the</p>
    <p>NOT OP­TI­MISTIC</p>
    <p>Noth­ing I have seen so far makes me op­ti­mistic. ’’</p>
    <p>PROF BILL BOWTELL, a pub­lic health strate­gist and ad­junct pro­fes­sor at the Uni­ver­sity of New South Wales in Aus­tralia. WHEN POL­I­CY­MAK­ERS FREEZE</p>
    <p>Of much greater con­cern, when data emerged that cases were ris­ing... pol­i­cy­mak­ers seemed to be frozen, un­will­ing to re-shut­down to con­tain the pan­demic. ’’</p>
    <p>DR THOMAS TSAI, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Har­vard T.H. Chan School of Pub­lic Health’s Depart­ment of Health Pol­icy and Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>CALL TO HEED COM­MON SENSE</p>
    <p>past month. It now sees a daily aver­age of over 1,300 cases com­pared with 100 at the be­gin­ning of last month. Ex­perts have pointed the fin­ger at com­pla­cency among both the gov­ern­ment and its pop­u­la­tion that led to the econ­omy and so­ci­ety re­open­ing too much, too soon.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, which was also thought to have had the virus un­der con­trol de­spite never hav­ing im­posed a lock­down, saw a grow­ing num­ber of new in­fec­tions from last month, many with un­known ori­gins. Its cases have more than tripled from around 1,200 at the start of July to over 4,000 yesterday as it added an­other 69 new in­fec­tions. The death toll has also risen sharply to 47, from just seven be­fore the new out­break be­gan.</p>
    <p>The city had re­laxed so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions in June, re­mov­ing din­ing lim­its in restau­rants and al­low­ing gath­er­ings of up to 50 peo­ple. That same month, manda­tory quar­an­tine rules were lifted for busi­ness elites from some 480 Hong Kong-listed firms en­ter­ing from main­land China.</p>
    <p>Hid­den in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity, quar­an­tine-ex­empt peo­ple who brought in new cases, and looser so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules that al­lowed peo­ple to come into greater con­tact, all con­tributed to the city’s re­cent spike, said Pro­fes­sor Keiji Fukuda from the Uni­ver­sity of Hong Kong’s School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong is re­gain­ing con­trol over this cur­rent up­surge,” Prof Fukuda told The Sun­day Times. “But the over­all global out­look is con­tin­ued growth of in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>CA­REEN­ING OUT OF CON­TROL</p>
    <p>In the US – by far the most se­verely af­fected coun­try in the pan­demic, ac­count­ing for over a quar­ter of all cases and one in every five deaths – its lead­ers’ os­cil­la­tion be­tween in­ac­tion and in­ep­ti­tude has been blamed for let­ting the virus run ram­pant across the na­tion. It has now seen more than five mil­lion in­fec­tions and over 160,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>A slug­gish gov­ern­ment re­sponse, chronic un­der-fund­ing of pub­lic health, dis­crim­i­na­tory poli­cies that ren­dered mi­nor­ity groups par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble, and a decades-long shred­ding of the na­tion’s so­cial safety net that forced low-wage es­sen­tial work­ers to risk their lives for their liveli­hoods, were among a mul­ti­tude of fac­tors that led to this cri­sis, The At­lantic said in a damn­ing re­port pub­lished on Tues­day that culled views from over 100 ex­perts in var­i­ous fields. The prac­tice of mask wear­ing and de­bate over school re­open­ing have di­vided the na­tion, as state and lo­cal of­fi­cials im­posed con­flict­ing or­ders over the past month. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has in­sisted that in­creased test­ing is the rea­son for the surge in num­bers, though his as­ser­tion has been widely dis­puted by health ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“The spike in cases... has been due to un­der-test­ing, in­ad­e­quate mask­ing, and com­pla­cency around re­open­ing,” Dr Thomas Tsai, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Har­vard T.H. Chan School of Pub­lic Health’s Depart­ment of Health Pol­icy and Man­age­ment, told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“Of much greater con­cern, when data emerged that cases were ris­ing... pol­i­cy­mak­ers seemed to be frozen, un­will­ing to re-shut­down to con­tain the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>In In­dia, the third worst-hit na­tion af­ter the US and Brazil, the in­fec­tion curve has not once plateaued de­spite four months of lock­downs of vary­ing de­grees in dif­fer­ent re­gions. While some larger cities are on a ten­ta­tive road to re­cov­ery, smaller towns and even vil­lages are now re­port­ing more cases. In­dia’s daily aver­age of new in­fec­tions stands at more than 55,000, with the vast ma­jor­ity of its na­tional tally recorded in July alone.</p>
    <p>The soar­ing cases could be at­trib­uted to the par­tial re­sump­tion of travel and the un­in­hib­ited gath­er­ing of crowds post-lock­down, said Dr K. Srinath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia and a mem­ber of the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search Covid-19 task force. While in­creased test­ing may be one rea­son for the higher num­bers, “the ris­ing count does rep­re­sent the re­al­ity that a large num­ber of peo­ple are be­ing in­fected”.</p>
    <p>“Glob­ally, we are see­ing the mixed ef­fects of a still un­tamed first wave in­duced by hu­man folly, and a gen­uine sec­ond wave in some places where the virus is re­vis­it­ing as in­ter­na­tional travel re­sumes,” Dr Reddy told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“It is un­likely the global graph will see a turn­around till the virus’ free rein is halted in many re­gions. We will prob­a­bly have to wait till end</p>
    <p>The virus may be­come en­demic. That it chooses to spread is in its na­ture, but to slow it down is within our ca­pa­bil­ity – if we heed com­mon sense and ap­ply the lessons of sci­ence. ’’</p>
    <p>DR K. SRINATH REDDY, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia and a mem­ber of the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search Covid-19 task force.</p>
    <p>Septem­ber to judge if the virus is get­ting chained at the global level.”</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, too, struck a dispir­it­ing tone when it warned this past week that no mag­i­cal cure for the coro­n­avirus may ever be found even as sci­en­tists around the world con­tinue in ef­forts to man­u­fac­ture a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>‘ELIM­I­NATE, NOT SUP­PRESS’</p>
    <p>The Uni­ver­sity of New South Wales’ Prof Bowtell is among a group of prom­i­nent health ex­perts ad­vo­cat­ing that gov­ern­ments pur­sue an am­bi­tious strat­egy of elim­i­nat­ing the virus al­to­gether rather than sim­ply seek­ing to sup­press its spread while await­ing a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, which has fol­lowed a sup­pres­sion strat­egy aimed at keep­ing cases num­bers low, is still bat­tling a mas­sive out­break that emerged in its sec­ond most pop­u­lous state of Vic­to­ria a month ago. It has set new daily records for both in­fec­tions and deaths over the past fort­night, with its na­tional tally now top­ping 20,000 in­fected and over 270 dead. “There is too much de­lay of mea­sures that could be taken now in the fond hope that a vac­cine is around the cor­ner,” Prof Bowtell said. “But a vac­cine is not a cure.”</p>
    <p>This past week, Vic­to­ria de­clared a state of dis­as­ter and put its state cap­i­tal of Mel­bourne un­der a sixweek lock­down. The harsh re­stric­tions came af­ter a re­cent door­knock­ing cam­paign to check on 3,000 in­fected peo­ple found that 800 of them were not at home. The state added an­other 466 new cases and 12 deaths yesterday.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bour­ing New Zealand, on the other hand, has gone 100 days since its last lo­cally trans­mit­ted case, though its gov­ern­ment re­mains on high alert and has urged its peo­ple against com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>“We must now pur­sue elim­i­na­tion. There is no sta­ble level of in­fec­tion – it is either go­ing up as it is now, or forced down and then out,” Prof Bowtell said. “What is stop­ping the pur­suit of this strat­egy is a com­bi­na­tion of pow­er­ful eco­nomic forces, in­er­tia, timid­ity and – in the US at least – anti-sci­ence.”</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence be­tween elim­i­na­tion and sup­pres­sion is mostly a mat­ter of de­gree, the Uni­ver­sity of Hong Kong’s Prof Fukuda said. But seek­ing to elim­i­nate the virus al­to­gether may come at a higher, more im­me­di­ate cost. “It comes down to the ques­tion of whether a so­ci­ety is will­ing to ac­cept the costs – emo­tional, men­tal, eco­nomic, etc – of achiev­ing fewer cases. The an­swer will de­pend a lot on the pop­u­la­tion, es­pe­cially its lead­er­ship and cul­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Given the per­sis­tence of Covid-19 world­wide, the real ques­tion be­fore coun­tries is what is an ac­cept­able de­gree of com­bined con­trol mea­sures – such as bor­der con­trols, re­duced travel, so­cial dis­tanc­ing, school clo­sures, test­ing, masks etc – and du­ra­tion of such mea­sures to achieve rel­a­tively low lev­els of in­fec­tions and deaths.”</p>
    <p>For In­dia’s Dr Reddy, the like­li­hood that the coro­n­avirus is here to stay looms large. “The virus may be­come en­demic,” he said. “That it chooses to spread is in its na­ture, but to slow it down is within our ca­pa­bil­ity – if we heed com­mon sense and ap­ply the lessons of sci­ence.”</p>
