    <p>Six months ago, a fall­ing tree branch shat­tered the rear wind­screen of Mr Mo­ham­mad Nor­man Ga­tot Is­man’s car.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, dis­as­ter struck in the same place twice, when a large tree fell on top of the 39-year-old’s mo­tor­bike in the carpark next to Block 68 Lorong 5 Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>His was not the only ve­hi­cle dam­aged, with pho­tos of the scene show­ing sev­eral cars and mo­tor­bikes knocked over or crushed by the fall­ing tree.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that no­body was hurt.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­ham­mad Nor­man told The Straits Times that the in­ci­dent took place around 7am, when he was about to head out to work as a fire­fighter.</p>
    <p>His mo­tor­bike is now badly dam­aged, he said, adding that he is tak­ing the ve­hi­cle to a me­chanic to­day for an as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>When his car was dam­aged in June, Mr Mo­ham­mad Nor­man did not re­ceive com­pen­sa­tion from Bis­han-Toa Payoh Town Coun­cil’s in­sur­ers. He was told that the town coun­cil’s hor­ti­cul­ture con­trac­tor faced man­power short­ages ow­ing to Covid-19, and was hence un­able to per­form nec­es­sary main­te­nance work on sched­ule.</p>
    <p>“This mishap has af­fected me badly as I am us­ing my ve­hi­cles for work to sup­port my fam­ily fi­nan­cially,” Mr Mo­ham­mad Nor­man said in an e-mail to the town coun­cil about the re­cent in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent, Mr K.U. John, 52, a tech­ni­cian, said it was lucky that the tree had fallen in the morn­ing. “In the evening, many peo­ple sit there and chit-chat,” he said.</p>
    <p>The town coun­cil’s chair­man and vice-chair­man did not re­spond to queries on the in­ci­dent.</p>
