    <p>Sin­ga­porean stu­dents en­rolled in over­seas uni­ver­si­ties are adopt­ing a wait-and-see ap­proach in de­cid­ing if they should re­turn to their host coun­tries, de­spite the Gov­ern­ment’s as­sur­ances that they will be cov­ered with med­i­cal sub­si­dies and in­sur­ance should they catch Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said last month that the au­thor­i­ties will now al­low stu­dents to travel over­seas as aca­demic terms will soon re­sume, many say their de­ci­sion hinges on the sit­u­a­tion in their host coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Those study­ing over­seas at in­sti­tu­tions where dis­tance learn­ing is not of­fered as an op­tion will be el­i­gi­ble for gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies and in­sur­ance cov­er­age if they test pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus and seek treat­ment in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But some, like Ms Car­men Chin, a first-year stu­dent at the Univer­sity of Mel­bourne in Aus­tralia, said the an­nounce­ment would not im­pact her de­ci­sion to re­turn.</p>
    <p>“Our stu­dent visa re­quires us to get health in­sur­ance. So if I were in Aus­tralia and I got Covid-19, I would choose to get treated there,” said the 20-year-old, who is in a bach­e­lor of arts pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“It would be eas­ier to con­tain the virus if I get tested, quar­an­tined and treated there. I would not want to ‘im­port’ the virus back home.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chin said her first se­mes­ter, which be­gan last month and ends in De­cem­ber, is be­ing con­ducted fully online, though things could change in the next se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion whether to travel to Mel­bourne or not is also out of her hands as the city – the cap­i­tal of Vic­to­ria state that has been the hard­est-hit state in the pan­demic – is still un­der strict lock­down re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Chin: “If Mel­bourne al­lows us in, I would want to go over. It is def­i­nitely chal­leng­ing to not be able to at­tend school phys­i­cally. The first se­mes­ter of the first year is es­pe­cially im­por­tant for us to as­sim­i­late into the school and its cul­ture, and it is dif­fi­cult to do that from home in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Some who chose to re­turn abroad also said the Gov­ern­ment’s an­nounce­ment had lit­tle bear­ing on their de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Teresa Yong, 22, a third-year stu­dent at the Univer­sity of Manch­ester who is read­ing so­cial an­thro­pol­ogy, re­turned to Manch­ester on Aug 30. She had booked her flight in late July.</p>
    <p>She said she is con­cerned about catch­ing Covid-19 in the United King­dom, but chose to re­turn there as “I thought of the sit­u­a­tion as some­thing that we can­not keep run­ning away from”.</p>
    <p>“If I were to test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in the middle of the term, I think it would make more sense to seek treat­ment (in the UK). I would be putting more peo­ple at risk trav­el­ling back to Sin­ga­pore,” she added.</p>
    <p>There is an op­tion for stu­dents in her fac­ulty to do full re­mote learn­ing for the se­mes­ter, but online learn­ing is very dif­fer­ent from faceto-face classes, she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s harder to en­gage with the study ma­te­ri­als and top­ics, es­pe­cially for sub­ject ar­eas like mine where in­ter­ac­tions and dis­cus­sions in lec­tures and tu­to­ri­als add a lot of value to our learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>She also cited dif­fi­cul­ties in online learn­ing as one of the rea­sons she chose to re­turn to the UK. “Due to the time dif­fer­ence, I would have to at­tend lessons at odd hours if I were in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Mr Nidesh Mu­ralid­ha­ran, who is read­ing law at the Univer­sity of Bris­tol in the UK, is fly­ing back to Bris­tol on Sun­day. He will have to serve a 14-day iso­la­tion pe­riod be­fore his fi­nal year of stud­ies be­gins on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>“The self-iso­la­tion will be at our own costs. If we don’t have our own ac­com­mo­da­tion, we’ll be put up at a gov­ern­ment facility at our own ex­pense,” said the 24-year-old, who will be stay­ing in a pri­vate apart­ment and serv­ing his quar­an­tine there.</p>
    <p>He will get his meals de­liv­ered, he said, and or­der gro­ceries online or have a friend help to pick them up.</p>
    <p>“This is my last year. The univer­sity has told us to come back if we are able to... All of our lec­tures will be online but our tu­to­ri­als will be face-to-face, so I’d pre­fer to be there for my tu­to­ri­als, at the very least, dur­ing a cru­cial year,” said Mr Nidesh.</p>
    <p>But he feels re­as­sured some­what by the Gov­ern­ment’s an­nounce­ment, as “it’s def­i­nitely im­por­tant to know that there’s al­ways the op­tion to come back home in case things go wrong”.</p>
    <p>There are about 19,000 Sin­ga­pore stu­dents en­rolled in uni­ver­si­ties in the United States, Britain and</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>On the home front, a large num­ber of for­eign stu­dents also ap­pear to be wait­ing for the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion to blow over.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said about 10,000 in­ter­na­tional stu­dents have left Sin­ga­pore since March, and since then, MOE and the schools have fa­cil­i­tated the re­turn to Sin­ga­pore for about half of them.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the 5,000-plus stu­dents who have yet to re­turn are study­ing at in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, such as uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>An MOE spokesman said stu­dents who have not re­turned to Sin­ga­pore are re­ceiv­ing sup­port from their teach­ers and lec­tur­ers through home-based learn­ing and in­struc­tional ma­te­ri­als via e-plat­forms.</p>
