    <p>There has been much dis­cus­sion by the Gov­ern­ment and cit­i­zens on the topic of fos­ter­ing racial har­mony and re­li­gious tol­er­ance in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Many of us from the Pioneer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions learnt tol­er­ance and un­der­stand­ing of peo­ple from dif­fer­ent eth­nic and re­li­gious back­grounds through sports, when we were grow­ing up in the kam­pung and in school.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball was one sport that united us as a team and as one peo­ple, ir­re­spec­tive of who we were. From the kam­pung ar­eas of New­ton and Kam­pong Java in the 1960s emerged the New­tonites foot­ball team, which pro­duced seven na­tional foot­ball play­ers who were from dif­fer­ent eth­nic groups.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, many of us do­ing part-time na­tional ser­vice in the 1970s played for the Spe­cial Con­stab­u­lary (po­lice) foot­ball squad, which again was made up of play­ers from the four eth­nic groups.</p>
    <p>Through foot­ball, we be­came friends, and to­day we still get to­gether a few times a year to makan (eat) and chit-chat at the Sin­ga­pore Cricket Club.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve we should rekin­dle and cul­ti­vate the kam­pung spirit from a young age through team sports such as foot­ball at the com­mu­nity level, to foster racial and re­li­gious tol­er­ance and har­mony.</p>
