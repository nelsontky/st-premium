    <p>As emer­gency fi­nan­cial mea­sures in­tro­duced to fight the coro­n­avirus pan­demic near their use-by date, a process of wean­ing busi­ness and so­ci­ety off them has to be­gin. This has to bal­ance sev­eral im­per­a­tives, all of which are im­por­tant in them­selves. These are the over­all need for macroe­co­nomic sta­bil­ity, which in­cludes vi­able spend­ing poli­cies that do not drain gov­ern­ment funds, the need for a trained and skilled work­force that has not be­come overly de­pen­dent on such sup­port, and so­cial co­he­sive­ness which de­mands that no fam­ily is left in the lurch. The de­ci­sion made or re­quired on one front may ex­act a cost else­where. But a so­lu­tion can­not be avoided. These are chal­lenges Sin­ga­pore will have to start to meet soon.</p>
    <p>A key task awaits the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore in this re­gard as it works with banks on how to wean com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als off some of the re­lief mea­sures that were rolled out. There is no doubt that the mea­sures, on which the cen­tral bank worked with the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try, have done much to keep com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als afloat in tur­bu­lent wa­ters. How­ever, such pro­tec­tive ini­tia­tives can­not be­come per­ma­nent be­cause they would skew the work­ings of the fi­nan­cial sys­tem in un­fair and, ul­ti­mately, un­sus­tain­able ways. A time has to come when com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als that have taken up the re­liefs, which in­clude debt mora­to­ri­ums on mort­gage pay­ments, must be­gin to make re­pay­ments.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge is to avoid alike what is termed the “cliff ef­fect”, or com­plete with­drawal of re­lief mea­sures at one go, and the op­po­site pit­fall – their in­fea­si­ble con­tin­u­a­tion in­def­i­nitely. The pol­icy mix cho­sen ul­ti­mately will need to strike a bal­ance which en­sures that most debtors can re­pay their loans. At the same time, banks can­not be ex­pected to ab­sorb dam­age to their bal­ance sheets when stim­u­lus mea­sures are rolled back, be­cause de­faults will spill over into the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>What this means is that job cre­ation must con­tinue to be a bedrock of eco­nomic re­cov­ery from Covid-19. For that to oc­cur, the fis­cal pro­bity that has charted Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic suc­cess all these years must be com­bined with its em­pha­sis on work­fare, or of­fi­cial sup­port for re­train­ing and reskilling that makes work­ers ca­pa­ble of mov­ing into new jobs and eco­nomic sec­tors, and not leave them de­pen­dent on wel­fare that sucks pro­duc­tive life out of the econ­omy. At the same time, how­ever, vul­ner­a­ble Sin­ga­pore­ans will need to be cared for con­tin­u­ally. Even be­fore the pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore in­vested the imag­i­na­tion of its pol­i­cy­mak­ers in de­vis­ing pro­grammes that pro­vided safety nets for the vul­ner­a­ble so they would not be left by the way­side of eco­nomic progress. Chil­dren, es­pe­cially, were not al­lowed to fall out of the ed­u­ca­tional cal­cu­lus of the fu­ture. Eas­ing re­liance on Covid sup­port schemes will be chal­leng­ing and the next crit­i­cal phase Sin­ga­pore has to nav­i­gate.</p>
