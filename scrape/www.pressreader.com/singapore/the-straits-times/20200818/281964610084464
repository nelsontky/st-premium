    <p>SYD­NEY • US tech­nol­ogy gi­ant Google went on the of­fen­sive yes­ter­day against an Aus­tralian plan forc­ing digital gi­ants to pay for news con­tent, telling users their per­sonal data would be “at risk”.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia an­nounced last month that firms like Google and Face­book would have to pay news me­dia for con­tent, af­ter 18 months of ne­go­ti­a­tions ended with­out agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The land­mark mea­sures would in­clude fines worth mil­lions of dol­lars for non-com­pli­ance and force trans­parency around the closely guarded al­go­rithms firms use to rank con­tent. Google is now fight­ing a rear­guard ac­tion to pre­vent the mea­sures from en­ter­ing into force – and has been ac­cused by Aus­tralia of spread­ing “mis­in­for­ma­tion” in the process.</p>
    <p>Google yes­ter­day told users in a new home page pop-up that “the way Aussies use Google is at risk” and their search ex­pe­ri­ence “will be hurt” by the changes.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy titan linked to an open let­ter claim­ing it would be forced to hand over users’ search data to news me­dia com­pa­nies and give them in­for­ma­tion that would “help them ar­ti­fi­cially in­flate their rank­ing” above other web­sites.</p>
    <p>Google says it al­ready part­ners Aus­tralian news me­dia by pay­ing the com­pa­nies mil­lions of dol­lars and send­ing billions of clicks each year, sug­gest­ing the changes could put its free ser­vices “at risk”.</p>
    <p>“But rather than en­cour­ag­ing these types of part­ner­ships, the law is set up to give big me­dia com­pa­nies spe­cial treat­ment and to en­cour­age them to make enor­mous and un­rea­son­able de­mands that would put our free ser­vices at risk,” the let­ter states.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion will ini­tially fo­cus on Face­book and Google – two of the world’s rich­est and most pow­er­ful com­pa­nies – but could even­tu­ally ap­ply to any digital plat­form.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s pro­pos­als are be­ing closely watched around the world, as reg­u­la­tors in­creas­ingly train their fo­cus on the rapidly chang­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>News me­dia world­wide have suf­fered in the digital econ­omy, where big tech firms over­whelm­ingly cap­ture ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis has been ex­ac­er­bated by the eco­nomic col­lapse caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with dozens of Aus­tralian news­pa­pers closed and hun­dreds of jour­nal­ists sacked in re­cent months.</p>
