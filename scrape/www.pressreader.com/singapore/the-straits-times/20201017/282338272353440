    <p>Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has backed Harry Maguire to “bounce back” af­ter his tor­rid start to the sea­son, but the cen­tre­back could miss to­day’s Pre­mier League trip to New­cas­tle be­cause of an in­jury.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old has strug­gled for United since his well-doc­u­mented Greek court case in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, he was sent off in the first half of Eng­land’s 1-0 loss to Den­mark in the Na­tions League – just days af­ter help­ing Gareth South­gate’s team to vic­tory against Bel­gium.</p>
    <p>“When Harry is part of the Eng­land team that beats No. 1 ranked Bel­gium, that’s just a nor­mal day, and then you get the head­lines when you get the send­ing-off,” said Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>“That’s j ust foot­ball for you. There are so many ups and downs that we have got to deal with it, in­di­vid­u­ally and as a group.</p>
    <p>“Harry’s got great re­silience. I know he’ll bounce back. He wants to play, he wants to just work his way out of the last cou­ple of games that he’s been crit­i­cised (for).”</p>
    <p>The United boss said at his pre­match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that Maguire “picked up a knock” against Den­mark and would have a fit­ness test.</p>
    <p>United head to New­cas­tle look­ing to re­act to the 6-1 hum­bling at home to Tot­ten­ham be­fore the in­ter­na­tional break.</p>
    <p>The loss left them in 16th place with three points from as many matches and Sol­sk­jaer said his play­ers were ready to turn their for­tunes around.</p>
    <p>“We know we’ve started the sea­son badly and that game ended re­ally badly... We know we have to per­form bet­ter but we’ve now had two weeks to work on it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think Bruno (Fer­nan­des) spoke re­ally well the other day about how we are united, we have to stay to­gether. We’ve got to get on with it.”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer, speak­ing for the first time since the club brought in Edin­son Ca­vani, Fa­cundo Pel­listri and Alex Telles on trans­fer-dead­line day, said he was look­ing for­ward to in­te­grat­ing the new play­ers.</p>
    <p>Ca­vani is yet to join the squad be­cause he is in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“All three of them have got some­thing dif­fer­ent to what we have and they’ll def­i­nitely come in and help us,” said the United boss.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian also brushed off comments by mid­fielder Paul Pogba, who is out of con­tract next June and said on France duty that he would love to play for Real Madrid one day.</p>
    <p>“Paul’s our player, he’s go­ing to be here for another two years and I’m sure he’s fo­cused on do­ing his best for us,” Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
