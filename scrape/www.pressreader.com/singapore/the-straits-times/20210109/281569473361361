    <p>Malaysians who are Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents working here will be able to re­turn home for short-term leave be­fore com­ing back to Sin­ga­pore for work.</p>
    <p>From Mon­day, they can ap­ply for the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment (PCA) scheme, which will let them re­turn to Malaysia for a short time af­ter working in Sin­ga­pore for at least 90 days.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, work­ers had to be spon­sored by their em­ploy­ers to qual­ify for the PCA scheme.</p>
    <p>Un­der the PCA, ap­proved trav­ellers must have stayed in their coun­try of em­ploy­ment for at least 90 days be­fore re­turn­ing to their home coun­try home leave.</p>
    <p>The change, an­nounced by the High Com­mis­sion of Malaysia in Sin­ga­pore on Face­book yes­ter­day, comes ahead of Chi­nese New Year fes­tiv­i­ties, when many Malaysians working here usu­ally head home to cel­e­brate with their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>When they re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, they will serve a 14-day stay-home for short-term no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity be­fore tak­ing a Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>It is not clear if the daily quota of 2,000 trav­ellers un­der the PCA will re­main the same.</p>
    <p>Those who join the scheme have to pay for the ac­com­mo­da­tion un­der the stay-home no­tice, the swab test and med­i­cal treat­ment, if re­quired.</p>
    <p>Only over­land travel is al­lowed un­der the scheme via the Cause­way at Wood­lands and the Tuas Sec­ond Link.</p>
    <p>The PCA is a travel lane be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia that started on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>It is one of two spe­cial bi­lat­eral travel ar­range­ments, with the other be­ing the Re­cip­ro­cal Green</p>
    <p>Lane (RGL), which al­lows for short-term travel of up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>The RGL ap­plies only to es­sen­tial busi­ness or of­fi­cial trav­ellers, and re­quires a much stricter, con­trolled itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, these trav­ellers can­not use public trans­port ex­cept for pri­vate-hire cars and taxis, un­like those un­der the PCA.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment is a slight re­lax­ation of travel rules be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, which shut its bor­ders last March.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, more than 300,000 trav­ellers used the Cause­way ev­ery day. Among these were about 100,000 Malaysians who com­muted daily be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion i n Malaysia has shown signs of wors­en­ing lately, with the au­thor­i­ties re­port­ing 3,027 new coro­n­avirus cases – a daily high – on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Its health of­fi­cials have warned that Covid-19 cases there could hit 8,000 a day by the mid­dle of March if cur­rent in­fec­tion rates are not brought un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, Sin­ga­pore re­quired all trav­ellers with re­cent travel his­tory to Malaysia to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties upon ar­rival here, up from the pre­vi­ous re­quire­ment of a seven-day stay-home no­tice at their place of res­i­dence.</p>
