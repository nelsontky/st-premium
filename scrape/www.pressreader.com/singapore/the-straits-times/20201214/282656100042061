    <p>Why should A be for ap­ple and B be for ball?</p>
    <p>Authors Kshama Alur and Akhila Das Blah thought it would be fun for young read­ers to as­so­ciate the let­ters with “Ah Ma” and “Botanic Gar­dens” in­stead.</p>
    <p>Their al­pha­bet board book, ti­tled A To Z Of Sin­ga­pore, fea­tures lo­cal food, places of in­ter­est, games, cul­ture and more.</p>
    <p>The two moth­ers and long-time friends took a year to come up with this edi­tion, fash­ioned af­ter their com­pany Indi­grow’s first book A To Z Of In­dia, which has since been turned into a themed col­lec­tion with flash cards, puz­zles and mem­ory games.</p>
    <p>Kshama tells The Straits Times that her son Neil Kohler, now three years old, sparked the idea for these books. “We are a mul­ti­cul­tural fam­ily. I was born in In­dia, my hus­band Richard was born in South Africa and we have been liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore for over a decade,” says Kshama, who de­clined to re­veal her age.</p>
    <p>“When I was preg­nant, I knew I wanted Neil to grow up with ex­po­sure to dif­fer­ent cul­tures. The world is get­ting more di­verse and global, and I wanted him to get to know his roots and his en­vi­ron­ment in a de­light­ful way.”</p>
    <p>In A To Z Of Sin­ga­pore, with pic­tures by il­lus­tra­tor Kris­ten Kiong, D is for durian and O is for on­deh on­deh.</p>
    <p>It is a pity that Kshama’s favourite food did not make it into the pages. “No one can stop me if I have a crav­ing for char kway teow or pep­per crab,” she says.</p>
    <p>But she man­aged to in­clude many fond mem­o­ries in Sin­ga­pore. “I had a fish wig­gle out of my hand in the wet mar­ket,” she re­calls. “The un­cle at the stall was as as­ton­ished as me.”</p>
    <p>This be­came the idea for the let­ter W, which reads: The white­fish wig­gled out of the wet mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The en­try for the let­ter B (“The banded lan­gurs are play­ing bad­minton in the Botanic Gar­dens”) was in­spired by an in­ci­dent when a mon­key took her shut­tle­cock when she was play­ing bad­minton in a park.</p>
    <p>The book, which taps Akhila’s ex­per­tise as an early child­hood pro­fes­sional, in­cludes sug­ges­tions on how par­ents can read the books with their chil­dren and ask ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Kshama, who started her ca­reer in brand marketing, now runs Indi­grow and a sus­tain­abil­ity con­sult­ing com­pany, The Bet­ter Al­ter­na­tive, that she founded.</p>
    <p>She plans to work on other edi­tions fea­tur­ing Asian coun­tries such as China, Ja­pan and South Korea. “It is im­por­tant to me to raise a third-cul­ture kid who can em­brace di­ver­sity and ev­ery cul­ture he in­ter­acts with in the fu­ture,” she says.</p>
    <p>• A To Z Of Sin­ga­pore ($17) is avail­able at www.in­di­growkids.com</p>
    <p>• This is part of a se­ries where ex­perts give tips on how to get kids to love read­ing.</p>
