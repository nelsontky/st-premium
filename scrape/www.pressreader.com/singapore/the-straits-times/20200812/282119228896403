    <p>The In­done­sian gov­ern­ment is hope­ful that a j ob creation Bill would be rat­i­fied by Par­lia­ment by the end of this month, a se­nior min­is­ter said, amid wor­ries of a re­ces­sion this year due to the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The Job Creation Bill will have stip­u­la­tions that are friend­lier to in­vestors, in­clud­ing al­low­ing em­ploy­ers to hire and fire with lower sev­er­ance pay and ben­e­fits com­pared with cur­rent labour laws.</p>
    <p>The Bill also lets com­pa­nies re­cruit work­ers on flex­i­ble work­ing hours, thus giv­ing em­ploy­ers the abil­ity to avoid pay­ing full-time wages.</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter Luhut Pand­jai­tan, a close ad­viser to Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, said six out of the coun­try’s eight ma­jor labour unions have agreed to sup­port the Bill.</p>
    <p>The Bill was put aside for re­view in April af­ter con­cerned labour groups stepped up their street protests.</p>
    <p>“The ba­sic prob­lems of the Bill are it does not recog­nise min­i­mum wage... cuts sev­er­ance pay, makes re­trench­ment so easy,” Mr Said Iqbal, chair­man of labour union KSPI, said in a state­ment on Aug 3.</p>
    <p>He re­gret­ted that Par­lia­ment has re­vived the de­lib­er­a­tion of the Bill dis­creetly, and threat­ened to mo­bilise fresh street protests.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent labour laws guar­an­tee work­ers an an­nual pay in­crease and at least twice the amount of sev­er­ance pay com­pared with most re­gional coun­tries. These would be ad­justed un­der the Bill.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s eco­nomic slump due to the coro­n­avirus has helped the gov­ern­ment’s ar­gu­ment to push through the new reg­u­la­tions, af­ter the pan­demic caused 3.7 mil­lion peo­ple to lose jobs.</p>
    <p>This raised the coun­try’s es­ti­mated to­tal of un­em­ployed In­done­sians to 10.6 mil­lion, nearly 8 per cent of the 133 mil­lion work­ers in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Asked about the chances of the Bill be­ing rat­i­fied in Par­lia­ment, Mr Luhut said: “Seven (out of nine) po­lit­i­cal par­ties (in the House) sup­port this gov­ern­ment. We are con­fi­dent.”</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing on Mon­day night in a we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by the Jakarta For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents Club.</p>
    <p>The Job Creation Bill will be­come law once voted by the ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment where Pres­i­dent Joko’s coali­tion has more than 60 per cent of the to­tal 575 seats.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, the world’s fourth­most pop­u­lous coun­try, is strug­gling to avoid a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy shrank by 5.32 per cent in the April to June pe­riod com­pared with a year ago, its first neg­a­tive quar­terly per­for­mance in 21 years.</p>
    <p>The Joko ad­min­is­tra­tion has been try­ing to lure more for­eign in­vest­ment and is cur­rently step­ping up its so­cial aid spend­ing such as grants and sub­sidised loans to sup­port con­sumer buy­ing power and help man­u­fac­tur­ers and re­tail­ers curb slow­downs.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the gov­ern­ment has ap­pealed to those in the mid­dle­and up­per-in­come classes to in­crease their spend­ing af­ter data showed that funds placed in banks’ sav­ings ac­counts and time de­posits have surged.</p>
    <p>“No haj this year, no um­rah (pil­grim­age), no in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ences, no tourists go­ing to Sin­ga­pore, Ja­pan. We spend more than US$15 bil­lion (S$20.6 bil­lion) on these ac­tiv­i­ties. The money now is still in their pocket,” Mr Luhut said.</p>
    <p>“We want them to shift to spend­ing their money do­mes­ti­cally. Help the econ­omy,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Job Creation Bill was put aside for re­view in April af­ter con­cerned labour groups stepped up their street protests... Cur­rent labour laws guar­an­tee work­ers an an­nual pay in­crease and at least twice the amount of sev­er­ance pay com­pared with most re­gional coun­tries. These would be ad­justed un­der the Bill.</p>
