    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den said that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede the coun­try’s Nov 3 elec­tion was an “em­bar­rass­ment” that will re­flect poorly on his legacy.</p>
    <p>“How can I say this tact­fully,” Mr Bi­den told reporters in his home town of Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware. “I think it will not help the Pres­i­dent’s legacy.”</p>
    <p>WILM­ING­TON (Delaware) • Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den said that Mr Don­ald Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede the United States elec­tion was an “em­bar­rass­ment” that will re­flect poorly on his legacy.</p>
    <p>“I just think it’s an em­bar­rass­ment, quite frankly,” Mr Bi­den said on Tues­day when asked what he thinks about Mr Trump’s re­fusal to ac­knowl­edge de­feat in the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“How can I say this tact­fully,” Mr Bi­den told reporters in his home town of Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware. “I think it will not help the Pres­i­dent’s legacy.”</p>
    <p>When asked what he would say to Mr Trump, given the chance, Mr Bi­den replied: “Mr Pres­i­dent, look for­ward to speak­ing with you.”</p>
    <p>But the Demo­cratic Pres­i­den­t­elect down­played the im­pact of Mr Trump’s re­fusal to as­sist with the tran­si­tion to­wards a new US ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“The fact that they’re not will­ing to ac­knowl­edge we won at this point is not of much con­se­quence in our plan­ning,” Mr Bi­den said, look­ing ahead to his in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think, at the end of the day, it’s all go­ing to come to fruition on Jan 20, and be­tween now and then, my hope and ex­pec­ta­tion are that the Amer­i­can peo­ple do know, and do un­der­stand that there has been a tran­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo voiced con­fi­dence on Tues­day that once ev­ery “le­gal” vote was counted, it would lead to a “sec­ond Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion”, ap­pear­ing to re­ject Mr Bi­den’s elec­tion vic­tory over Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>But hours af­ter with­er­ing crit­i­cism over his com­ments, Mr Pom­peo, a close ally and ap­pointee of Mr Trump, ap­peared to soften his tone in a Fox News in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“I am very con­fi­dent that we will have a good tran­si­tion, that we will make sure that who­ever is in of­fice at noon on Jan 20 has all the tools read­ily avail­able so we don’t skip a beat with the ca­pac­ity to keep Amer­i­cans safe,” Mr Pom­peo said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, at a State Depart­ment brief­ing, he had said: “There will be a smooth tran­si­tion to a sec­ond Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Those com­ments drew praise from Mr Trump, who tweeted a video late on Tues­day of Mr Pom­peo’s com­ments, say­ing, “That’s why Mike was num­ber one in his class at West Point!”, re­fer­ring to the US mil­i­tary academy.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the White House in­stalled a Trump loy­al­ist in a key Pen­tagon post on Tues­day and pro­moted an­other one who has falsely called for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama a ter­ror­ist.</p>
    <p>De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper was re­placed by Mr Christo­pher Miller, who had been the di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Coun­tert­er­ror­ism Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The Pen­tagon said Mr Kash Pa­tel, who was the top counter-ter­ror­ism ad­viser on the White House Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, would be Mr Miller’s chief of staff.</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­tel was a top aide to Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Devin Nunes, the proTrump Repub­li­can who chaired the House In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee and is now its top mi­nor­ity mem­ber.</p>
    <p>While work­ing for Mr Nunes, Mr Pa­tel helped pro­duce a memo ac­cus­ing the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion and Depart­ment of Jus­tice of bias against Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>In the wake of Mr Esper’s de­par­ture, the Pen­tagon’s top pol­icy ad­viser James An­der­son re­signed, al­low­ing that post to be filled by Mr An­thony Tata, a re­tired army bri­gadier-gen­eral who has called Mr Obama “a ter­ror­ist leader”.</p>
    <p>Mr Tata failed to se­cure a Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing in Au­gust and was per­form­ing the du­ties of the deputy un­der­sec­re­tary of de­fence for pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The reshuf­fle raises the pos­si­bil­ity that Mr Trump will try to make good on still-un­ful­filled cam­paign pledges be­fore Jan 20, when Mr Bi­den takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>They in­clude po­ten­tially or­der­ing a full with­drawal of US forces from Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Elissa Slotkin, a Demo­crat who served as a se­nior Pen­tagon of­fi­cial in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, called on Mr Miller to put na­tional se­cu­rity in­ter­ests ahead of loy­alty to Mr Trump, say­ing “the coun­try and the mil­i­tary he has ded­i­cated his life to are count­ing on him to do the right thing”.</p>
    <p>I think, at the end of the day, it’s all go­ing to come to fruition on Jan 20, and be­tween now and then, my hope and ex­pec­ta­tion are that the Amer­i­can peo­ple do know, and do un­der­stand that there has been a tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>MR JOE BI­DEN, look­ing ahead to his Jan 20 in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
