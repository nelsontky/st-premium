    <p>From Milo to snorkel-like sil­i­cone Gill Masks used by health­care pro­fes­sion­als glob­ally, Sin­ga­pore is the sur­pris­ing start­ing point for some of the most ubiq­ui­tous con­sumer prod­ucts found around the world.</p>
    <p>Many were de­vel­oped and are man­u­fac­tured in fac­to­ries and plants run by na­tional in­dus­trial es­tate de­vel­oper JTC Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheong Wee Lee, di­rec­tor of the bio­med­i­cal and elec­tron­ics clus­ter at JTC, says: “You’ll be sur­prised that many global and lo­cal brands are de­sign­ing or pro­duc­ing things which are cre­at­ing waves glob­ally and are eas­ily recog­nised among Sin­ga­pore­ans, yet most do not know that they are made on our shores.</p>
    <p>“Ideas are flour­ish­ing, tal­ent is tin­ker­ing and things are com­ing alive at these cre­ative and ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing spa­ces.”</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore cel­e­brates its 55th birthday, The Sun­day Times takes a look at some hid­den gems that have put this lit­tle red dot on the man­u­fac­tur­ing world map.</p>
    <p>1. SK-II R.N.A. Power skin­care range De­signed and in­vented in Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Devo­tees of beauty brand SK-II’s best-sell­ing prod­ucts swear by their ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>The la­bel still sources its core Pit­era in­gre­di­ent – a nat­u­ral by-prod­uct of yeast fer­men­ta­tion with a cock­tail of amino acids, min­er­als, vi­ta­mins and or­ganic acids – from Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>How­ever, not many know that newer of­fer­ings like the SK-II R.N.A. Power range were for­mu­lated at the P&G Sin­ga­pore In­no­va­tion Cen­tre (SGIC) in Biopo­lis @ one-north. Amer­i­can con­glom­er­ate Proc­ter & Gam­ble (P&G) owns SK-II.</p>
    <p>The SGIC – Sin­ga­pore’s largest pri­vate re­search fa­cil­ity and one of 15 P&G re­search fa­cil­i­ties around the world – is home to 466 sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers from 27 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>De­signed and in­vented in Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>The Ambi Pur air fresh­en­ers that keep your bath­room smelling good were de­vel­oped right here, also at the P&G SGIC.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers found that the main cause of lin­ger­ing odours in bath­rooms was the am­mo­nia trapped on the sur­faces of walls, mak­ing typ­i­cal air fresh­en­ers in­ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Hence, they de­vel­oped a new type which can flush out the trapped odour mol­e­cules and neu­tralise them.</p>
    <p>The same toi­let mal­odour re­moval prod­uct, which re­tails un­der the Fe­breze brand name in the United States, Bri­tain and Ja­pan, be­came a best­seller in its cat­e­gory within six months of launch­ing in those coun­tries in 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>3. Ab­bott’s nu­tri­tion prod­ucts and for­mula milk Re­searched and man­u­fac­tured in Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can health­care com­pany Ab­bott – which makes nu­tri­tion prod­ucts and for­mula milk like Sim­i­lac, En­sure, Pe­di­aSure and Grow – re­searched and de­vel­oped sev­eral of their prod­ucts here be­fore they were ex­ported to the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>Ab­bott’s 46,000 sq m build­ing in Tuas Bio­med­i­cal Park is its largest pow­der nu­tri­tion plant in the world, serv­ing more than 36 mil­lion con­sumers across 48 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Last year, it pro­duced 60.9 mil­lion kg of pow­der – enough to fill 24 Olympic-sized swim­ming pools.</p>
    <p>Its Grow milk for tod­dlers was cre­ated first for chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore and is now avail­able through­out Asia.</p>
    <p>Prod­ucts like the En­sure Life adult milk for­mula and Pe­di­aSure Gold, for chil­dren aged one to 12, were de­vel­oped here too. They are man­u­fac­tured here as well for dis­tri­bu­tion to 29 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>4. Milo De­vel­oped and man­u­fac­tured in Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Gen­er­a­tions have grown up with the taste of Milo, but how many know that the Milo avail­able here was de­vel­oped in Sin­ga­pore and has been man­u­fac­tured in Jurong since 1984?</p>
    <p>Cater­ing to lo­cal palates, Nes­tle’s Jurong fac­tory pro­duces seven Milo recipes – in­clud­ing the world’s first Milo pow­der with no added su­gar, Milo Gao Kosong; as well as the less sweet Milo Gao Siew Dai.</p>
    <p>In fact, Sin­ga­pore is the home ground for the man­u­fac­tur­ing of the key in­gre­di­ent in Milo called Pro­tomalt – a spe­cial malt ex­tract made from bar­ley.</p>
    <p>The Milo made here is dis­trib­uted to coun­tries in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion and even some African coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Named af­ter a Ro­man ath­lete in Greek mythol­ogy, the choco­late malt drink was cre­ated by Aus­tralian chemist Thomas Mayne and launched in Syd­ney in 1934.</p>
    <p>Its par­ent com­pany Nes­tle has a re­search and devel­op­ment cen­tre lo­cated be­side its Jurong fac­tory.</p>
    <p>The fac­tory also hosts a Milo Dis­cov­ery Tour where vis­i­tors can see how the bev­er­age is made through in­ter­ac­tive ex­hi­bi­tions. Tours are sus­pended at the mo­ment due to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>5. Gill Masks De­signed and in­vented in Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>A re­us­able res­pi­ra­tor mask called the Gill Mask, which is used by front-line health­care work­ers and con­sumers around the world, was in­vented at JTC’s LaunchPad @ one-north.</p>
    <p>The Gill Lab team was formed this year dur­ing the early on­set of Covid-19 to tackle the per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment short­age around the world.</p>
    <p>Made from med­i­cal-grade sil­i­cone and anti-mi­cro­bial plas­tics, the mask con­forms to dif­fer­ent fa­cial fea­tures and is re­us­able and wash­able – re­duc­ing waste and con­serv­ing mask sup­plies sig­nif­i­cantly. It can also be ster­ilised in boil­ing wa­ter.</p>
    <p>While other res­pi­ra­tors need to be dis­posed of or re­quire ex­pen­sive and dif­fi­cult-to-find re­place­ment fil­ters to stay ef­fec­tive, the Gill Mask al­lows for the use of DIY fil­ters, cut from dis­pos­able masks or other ap­pro­pri­ate fil­ter ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>The mask was in­spired by snorkellin­g masks and it took the team less than two months to go from de­sign to pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>It is now used in places such as the United States, Bri­tain, Italy, the Philip­pines, Hong Kong, Aus­tralia and Ghana.</p>
    <p>Made-in-Sin­ga­pore prod­ucts ex­ported glob­ally 3M’s res­pi­ra­tors, win­dow films and retrore­flec­tive sheet­ing (above) Man­u­fac­tured at 3M Sin­ga­pore Tuas Plant</p>
    <p>From dis­pos­able res­pi­ra­tors that re­duce ex­po­sure to air­borne, non-oil-based par­ti­cles in a world bat­tling Covid-19 to win­dow films used in build­ings to block out up to 97 per cent of the sun’s ul­tra­vi­o­let rays and up to 60 per cent of the heat – all these are man­u­fac­tured at 3M’s plant in Tuas.</p>
    <p>The 3M Sin­ga­pore Tuas Plant is also a zero-land­fill site, where 100 per cent of the waste gen­er­ated is con­verted into en­ergy or re­cy­cled.</p>
    <p>Kim­berly-Clark’s Hug­gies prod­ucts Man­u­fac­tured in Tuas View In­dus­trial Es­tate</p>
    <p>Hug­gies’ Di­a­pers, Pull-Ups Pants and Gen­tle Care Baby Wipes (above) are man­u­fac­tured lo­cally.</p>
    <p>The Kim­berly-Clark Tuas Mill is one of seven Kim­berly-Clark fa­cil­i­ties glob­ally that man­u­fac­ture Hug­gies baby wipes and its patented ma­te­rial. Every step of the pro­duc­tion process – from raw ma­te­rial in­put and man­u­fac­tur­ing to test­ing and pack­ag­ing – is fully au­to­mated.</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce’s wide chord fan blades Man­u­fac­tured in Sele­tar Aero­space Park</p>
    <p>The Sele­tar Cam­pus in Sin­ga­pore is home to the first Rolls-Royce fa­cil­ity in Asia specif­i­cally de­signed to man­u­fac­ture the hol­low ti­ta­nium wide chord fan blades that help to pro­pel the Trent aero en­gines on se­lected Air­bus and Boe­ing planes, such as the Air­bus A380, A330­neo and A350 and Boe­ing 787 Dream­liner.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing a tonne of air per sec­ond, the fan pro­duces over 80 per cent of the en­gine’s thrust.</p>
