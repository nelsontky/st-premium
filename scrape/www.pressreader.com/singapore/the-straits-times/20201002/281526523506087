    <p>Mr Yuen Kuan Moon, who has been with Sing­tel since 1993, is set to be­come its group chief ex­ec­u­tive next year.</p>
    <p>He will be tak­ing over from Ms Chua Sock Koong, 62, who will re­tire on Jan 1, the Repub­lic’s largest telco said in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“With Sing­tel well po­si­tioned for the fu­ture, it is a good time for me to re­tire,” Ms Chua said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuen’s ap­point­ment by the com­pany’s board comes af­ter a year-long global search that con­sid­ered both in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal can­di­dates for the job, Sing­tel added.</p>
    <p>He beat out eight other com­peti­tors to land the top job, said board chair­man Lee Theng Kiat dur­ing a press brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuen, 53, is cur­rently CEO of Sing­tel’s con­sumer busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore and its chief dig­i­tal of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“He has risen through the ranks of the com­pany, with lead­er­ship po­si­tions in mar­ket­ing, busi­ness de­vel­op­ment and sales, and Telkom­sel in In­done­sia,” Sing­tel said. Telkom­sel is Sing­tel’s re­gional as­so­ciate.</p>
    <p>His roles in Sing­tel in­cluded vi­cepres­i­dent of re­gional op­er­a­tions and ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent of dig­i­tal con­sumer.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuen is also on the boards of Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment Group, and is a mem­ber of the Dig­i­tal Readi­ness Coun­cil Steer­ing Com­mit­tee, which aims to pre­pare Sin­ga­pore­ans for the dig­i­tal econ­omy and the Repub­lic’s Smart Na­tion plan.</p>
    <p>He is mar­ried with two chil­dren. He has been ap­pointed group CEO-des­ig­nate and will as­sume the role of group CEO af­ter Ms Chua re­tires. Ms Chua will stay on as se­nior ad­viser to Mr Lee to help with the lead­er­ship tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua, who has been group CEO since 2007, was for­merly Sing­tel in­ter­na­tional CEO and chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“I have seen a few global crises on my watch – the dot.com bust, the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the In­dia com­pe­ti­tion chal­lenges – and I am proud of how we have weath­ered those storms and busi­ness chal­lenges,” she said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua was also part of the core lead­er­ship team that de­vel­oped Sing­tel’s in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion strat­egy, which saw to the ac­qui­si­tion of Op­tus in Aus­tralia, among other re­gional in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>She was the first wo­man to be ap­pointed as the Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion’s deputy chair­man and to Sin­ga­pore’s Coun­cil of Pres­i­den­tial Ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuen told a press brief­ing yes­ter­day that he will be work­ing closely with the board, Ms Chua and his other col­leagues to en­sure a smooth tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>He will be meet­ing Sing­tel’s ma­jor cus­tomers, the union and the com­pany’s var­i­ous busi­ness unit heads over the next few months.</p>
    <p>The meet­ings will “help for­mu­late my strat­egy for tak­ing Sing­tel into the next phase of de­vel­op­ment”, he said, adding that more de­tails will be re­leased in time.</p>
    <p>“This is an ex­cit­ing junc­ture, with 5G and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion chang­ing the game, not just for the tele­coms sec­tor, but for en­ter­prises across all in­dus­tries,” Mr Yuen said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said Mr Yuen was cho­sen be­cause he is a “known en­tity (who) has been with the com­pany since the very be­gin­ning of his ca­reer”. “He has ex­hib­ited an abil­ity to work at dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the en­tire busi­ness of the Sing­tel group... He has a good ap­pre­ci­a­tion of what needs to be done,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuen holds a first-class hon­ours de­gree in en­gi­neer­ing from the Univer­sity of Western Aus­tralia and a Mas­ter of Sci­ence in man­age­ment from Stan­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel’s suc­ces­sion plans come as it strug­gles to grow its busi­ness amid the Covid-19 pan­demic and in­ten­si­fy­ing com­pe­ti­tion in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuen’s task will be to in­crease the com­pany’s prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>For the three months to June this year, the telco posted a 24.2 per cent drop in its earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, tax, de­pre­ci­a­tion and amor­ti­sa­tion to $897 mil­lion. This is down from $1.18 bil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>It posted its first-ever net loss of $668 mil­lion in the three months to Septem­ber last year. This was due to hav­ing to set aside $1.93 bil­lion for a fine im­posed on its In­dian as­so­ciate com­pany, Bharti Airtel.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel has been try­ing to grow its busi­ness with Dash, its e-wal­let, and has also ap­plied for a full dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cence with Grab.</p>
    <p>Last month, it launched 5G trial ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore and be­came the sec­ond telco af­ter StarHub to al­low con­sumers to surf on a faster mo­bile net­work.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel’s share price rose 3 cents to $2.15 when the mar­ket closed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>EX­CIT­ING JUNC­TURE</p>
    <p>This is an ex­cit­ing junc­ture, with 5G and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion chang­ing the game, not just for the tele­coms sec­tor, but for en­ter­prises across all in­dus­tries. ’’</p>
    <p>MR YUEN KUAN MOON, who is cur­rently CEO of Sing­tel’s con­sumer busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore and its chief dig­i­tal of­fi­cer. GOOD TIME TO RE­TIRE</p>
    <p>With Sing­tel well po­si­tioned for the fu­ture, it is a good time for me to re­tire.</p>
    <p>MS CHUA SOCK KOONG, who has been Sing­tel group CEO since 2007 and was for­merly Sing­tel in­ter­na­tional CEO.</p>
