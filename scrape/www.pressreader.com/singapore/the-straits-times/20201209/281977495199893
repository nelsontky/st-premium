    <p>Last week, a video high­light­ing a cov­ered walk­way in Pung­gol that stopped short of a bus stop went vi­ral. Three days after the video was posted, workers started rec­ti­fy­ing the is­sue.</p>
    <p>While I’m glad that the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties took ac­tion fol­low­ing the news, it does raise ques­tions, es­pe­cially since pub­lic funds are in­volved.</p>
    <p>That we had a com­pleted prod­uct for use in broad day­light that did not make sense to the end user ought to raise alarm bells.</p>
    <p>From the per­son ap­prov­ing the works and award­ing the ten­der, to the con­trac­tor who de­signed it, the workers on the ground who did the ac­tual con­struc­tion and per­son­nel who did the site sur­vey be­fore ap­prov­ing the fi­nal pay­ment – did no one feel that the fin­ished prod­uct was odd and raise the mat­ter?</p>
    <p>Was the work cul­ture one that in­stilled a sense of own­er­ship in all par­ties in­volved, or one that en­cour­aged a “get it done on time so long as we are paid and it does not mat­ter if it makes sense since it does not af­fect me” men­tal­ity?</p>
    <p>Also, who is pay­ing for the rec­ti­fi­ca­tion works be­ing car­ried out?</p>
