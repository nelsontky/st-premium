    <p>POP HYPNOCITY</p>
    <p>Peggy Hsu</p>
    <p>From Snow­man (2009) to Mag­i­cal Shop (2011), Tai­wanese singer-song­writer Peggy Hsu (right) has al­ways been a pur­veyor of whimsy and fan­tasy.</p>
    <p>This time round, she has con­jured Hypnocity (a more di­rect trans­la­tion of the Chi­nese ti­tle would be City Of Lost Things), a vaguely Euro­pean work, judg­ing by the swell of vi­o­lins and ac­cor­dion – and one in which death lurks, from ti­tles such as The Dy­ing Swan (“A cursed love/Can­not es­cape fate”) and Death Of A Slate Painter (“Liv­ing is not easy/Trapped in the sand”). There is a def­i­nite un­der­cur­rent of dark­ness here.</p>
    <p>Hsu is per­haps most ef­fec­tive on In The City With­out You, “Good Night”, in which the melody ten­derly evokes the ache of yearn­ing (“My thoughts are all of you/But where are you”).</p>
    <p>Fa­mil­iar names make up the nom­i­na­tion list for this year’s Golden Melody Awards’ Best Fe­male Man­darin Vo­cal­ist. In ad­di­tion to pre­vi­ously re­viewed ti­tles from Fish Leong, G.E.M. and Waa Wei, also in the run­ning are Tai­wan’s Faith Yang for The More Beau­ti­ful, The More In­vis­i­ble; Tai­wanese singer-song­writer Peggy Hsu for Hypnocity; and Tai­wanese-Amer­i­can singer Joanna Wang for Love Is Call­ing Me. The win­ner will be an­nounced on Oct 3.</p>
    <p>POP THE MORE BEAU­TI­FUL, THE MORE IN­VIS­I­BLE</p>
    <p>Faith Yang</p>
    <p>The in­trigu­ing mea culpa elec­tropop of Re­pen­tance opens Tai­wanese singer Faith Yang’s (left) sev­enth stu­dio al­bum. Is that a mis­chievous wink at her sup­pos­edly cold per­sona? (“So, I should have done my best not to be hated.”)</p>
    <p>And the al­bum closes with the skit­tery ti­tle track, a ru­mi­na­tion on the elu­sive­ness of beauty.</p>
    <p>These book­end tracks are com­posed by Chi­nese singer-song­writer Guo Ding, who was be­hind the ex­cel­lent The Silent Star Stone (2016).</p>
    <p>Other A-list col­lab­o­ra­tors here in­clude Lala Hsu, Hsiao Yu and Wil­liam Wei. The di­ver­sity of tal­ent makes for a work that packs in a lot – from the bal­ladry of Disori­ented to the bouncy pop of Body Sing. But it never feels less than co­he­sive, thanks to Yang’s dis­tinc­tive vo­cals, which seem more sup­ple with age.</p>
    <p>A beau­ti­ful record that de­serves to be in the spot­light.</p>
    <p>RETRO POP LOVE IS CALL­ING ME</p>
    <p>Joanna Wang</p>
    <p>The Tai­wanese-Amer­i­can singer’s vo­cals prove to be a per­fect fit in these at­mo­spheric re­makes of love songs from the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Joanna Wang (above) – who made her de­but in 2008 with Start From Here – has a smoky voice and sense of play­ful drama that cast these Man­darin, Can­tonese and Ja­panese chest­nuts in a new light.</p>
    <p>She is not in­ter­ested in ped­dling the songs here sim­ply for their nos­tal­gic value, choos­ing in­stead to leave her inim­itable stamp on the light and breathy Ap­ple Blos­som, the lazy and jazzy Blues In The Rain, and the sul­try For­get Him.</p>
    <p>One quib­ble: A wider se­lec­tion of songs would have been more wel­come than the rep­e­ti­tion of some num­bers in a dif­fer­ent lan­guage.</p>
