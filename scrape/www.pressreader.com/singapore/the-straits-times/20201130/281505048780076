    <p>Brav­ing the coarse ground, about 200 run­ners took to the track at Our Tampines Hub (OTH) yes­ter­day, split into small groups with so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place – all while bare­foot.</p>
    <p>The OTH Bare­foot Run 2020 race was among a few mass runs to take place here since re­stric­tions to curb the spread of Covid-19 were eased, giv­ing a glimpse into how sport­ing events will fare in the new nor­mal. Many runs sched­uled for the year have been post­poned or gone vir­tual.</p>
    <p>In the race, run­ners were as­signed to four cat­e­gories – open cat­e­gories for men and women above 18 and masters cat­e­gories for men and women above 40. Run­ners in the open cat­e­gories had to run three laps, while those in the masters cat­e­gories had to do two laps. Each lap was about 700m.</p>
    <p>All fin­ish­ers took home a to­ken medal, with the top three fin­ish­ers in each cat­e­gory re­ceiv­ing tro­phies.</p>
    <p>Ms Jil­lian See, 22, who placed first in the women’s open cat­e­gory, said she had looked for­ward to the race, her first since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter a very l ong break, it helped me gauge my stamina and readi­ness,” said the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment stu­dent.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers were par­tic­u­lar about sched­ul­ing time slots and seg­re­gat­ing run­ners into dif­fer­ent groups ac­cord­ing to their cat­e­gories to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing. Other mea­sures, in­clud­ing SafeEn­try checkin and tem­per­a­ture scan­ning, were also en­forced at the site.</p>
    <p>Some run­ners also do­nated their old shoes, adding to the over 4,000 pairs col­lected by OTH which will be do­nated for re­cy­cling. Sin­ga­pore Pools has pledged $20 for ev­ery pair of do­nated shoes up to a to­tal of $10,000, and the amount raised will go to Kheng Chiu Loke Tin Kee Home in Tampines.</p>
    <p>Mayor of North East Dis­trict Des­mond Choo, guest of hon­our at the run, said de­spite the chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances, ev­ery­one should strive to do good and fos­ter pub­lic spirit among the community.</p>
