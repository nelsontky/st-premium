    <p>Ja­cob Stock­dale in­sists Ire­land can win the Six Na­tions as they pre­pare to re­turn to ac­tion, even though Eng­land are firm favourites to claim the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Andy Far­rell’s side are fourth in the ta­ble, four points be­hind Eng­land and France (both 13 points), but those two teams have just one game re­main­ing in the cham­pi­onship which was put on hold by coro­n­avirus ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Ire­land host point-less Italy this Satur­day in an empty Lans­downe Road but face a far tougher task in Paris a week later against fel­low ti­tle chasers France.</p>
    <p>Ire­land, a point be­hind Scot­land who have a game left, can gain a max­i­mum 10 points from their two re­main­ing games but Eng­land are heavy favourites, with only a match against Italy to come.</p>
    <p>“For us, as a team, real­is­ti­cally we’ve got a Six Na­tions to fin­ish and we’re never go­ing to not aim for sil­ver­ware,” said Stock­dale, who scored seven tries in 2018 as Ire­land romped to the Six Na­tions Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>“Real­is­ti­cally, for us, I think it’s en­tirely achiev­able to get 10 points out of the next two games and pick up a tro­phy at the end of it.</p>
    <p>“I think that’s a re­al­is­tic goal for us, some­thing we’ll def­i­nitely as­pire to.”</p>
    <p>On a per­sonal level, the winger is keen to end a try drought that has ex­tended to seven Tests.</p>
    <p>The Ul­ster star is his own harsh­est critic but has closed his so­cial me­dia ac­counts af­ter re­ceiv­ing hor­rific abuse on­line.</p>
    <p>“For me per­son­ally, I’m never go­ing to deal well with dis­ap­point­ment,” said Stock­dale, who has scored 16 tries in his 28 Tests.</p>
    <p>“That’s part of hav­ing a com­pet­i­tive na­ture. It’s al­ways go­ing to be a dis­ap­point­ment when you haven’t played well.</p>
    <p>“For my­self per­son­ally, it’s about be­ing able to block that out and in­ter­nalise how I’m feel­ing about the game and hav­ing two or three guys’ opin­ions that I re­ally trust and lean­ing on them for that is mas­sive for me.”</p>
    <p>Stock­dale said the Ire­land coach­ing staff kept in touch dur­ing the lock­down as much to check up on play­ers’ men­tal health as to give them play­ing tips.</p>
    <p>He kept him­self busy restor­ing a 1966 Mus­tang car he bought on eBay, phon­ing round for a men­tal health char­ity and get­ting en­gaged.</p>
    <p>He said Ire­land’s play­ers were bat­tle hard­ened af­ter ap­pear­ing for their pro­vin­cial sides.</p>
    <p>“It has def­i­nitely made the tran­si­tion a bit more seam­less, but from a coach­ing point of view and a cul­tural point of view, the team and man­age­ment have done re­ally well to make sure we’re talk­ing things through and un­der­stand­ing each other again.”</p>
