    <p>MANILA • Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has vowed to pri­ori­tise buy­ing Covid-19 vac­cine to be made avail­able by Rus­sia or China, while tak­ing a swipe at phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms of Western na­tions ask­ing for ad­vance pay­ment for their of­fers.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte has ex­pressed op­ti­mism that the Philip­pines, which has recorded the re­gion’s high­est num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases at more than 269,000, would be “back to nor­mal” by De­cem­ber, pin­ning his hopes on the avail­abil­ity of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“We will give pref­er­ence to Rus­sia and China, pro­vided that their vac­cine is as good as any other in the mar­ket,” he said in a late-night tele­vised ad­dress on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Any vac­cine pur­chase by the Philip­pines, how­ever, will have to un­dergo a bid­ding process, he added.</p>
    <p>He sin­gled out China, which he said was un­like other coun­tries seek­ing “reser­va­tion fee” or ad­vance pay­ment.</p>
    <p>“The one good thing about China is you do not have to beg, you do not have to plead,” he said. “One thing wrong about the Western coun­tries, it’s all profit, profit, profit.”</p>
    <p>Moscow and Manila have agreed to work on clin­i­cal tri­als for Rus­sia’s vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte did not name any phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies seek­ing ad­vance pay­ment, but he said he warned their rep­re­sen­ta­tives in Manila to go home or “I’ll kick your ass”.</p>
