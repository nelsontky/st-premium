    <p>Mi­ami seem to have a knack for turn­ing up the heat against the Bos­ton Celtics in times of ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Down by 14 in Game 1 of their Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) East­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals, they ral­lied to win 117-114 in over­time. In Game 2 on Thurs­day night, they did it again af­ter trail­ing.</p>
    <p>Led by Go­ran Dragic’s game-high 25 points, the Heat turned it up in the sec­ond half, ral­ly­ing for a 106-101 vic­tory over the Celtics and a 2-0 lead in the series.</p>
    <p>Although they were down by 17 in the sec­ond quar­ter and 60-47 at half-time, Mi­ami thrashed the Celtics 37-17 in the third quar­ter and held on to win. Bam Ade­bayo scored 15 of his 21 points in the Heat’s blis­ter­ing third pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“We came here to these play-offs try­ing to win a cham­pi­onship,” said the for­ward, who was the hero of Game 1 with his crit­i­cal block in over­time. “We keep stack­ing these wins and hope­fully we get to that point. Right now, 2-0, we’ve got to keep stack­ing those ‘W’s.”</p>
    <p>Ade­bayo added 10 re­bounds and four as­sists, Jimmy But­ler had 14 points, four re­bounds, three as­sists and four steals. Six Mi­ami play­ers scored in dou­ble fig­ures, in­clud­ing Dun­can Robin­son, who had 18 points on six three-point­ers.</p>
    <p>“We like to make it hard for our­selves,” But­ler said of the Mi­ami “come­back kids”.</p>
    <p>The Celtics re­gained the lead in the fourth quar­ter and were up 94-89 with 4min 25sec left to play.</p>
    <p>But the Heat chipped away with a hook shot from Ade­bayo and a steal and dunk by But­ler.</p>
    <p>Dragic fol­lowed up two free throws with a three-pointer that put the Heat ahead 100-95 with 1min 42sec re­main­ing and Mi­ami pow­ered to the fin­ish line.</p>
    <p>Kemba Walker broke out of his scor­ing slump with 23 points for the Celtics. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Ta­tum scored 21 apiece.</p>
    <p>But Brown missed a three­p­ointer that would have tied it with 15 sec­onds to play and 20 Celtics turnovers led to 26 Mi­ami points.</p>
    <p>“They out­played us,” Walker said of the Heat’s third-quar­ter surge. “I think we got com­fort­able and those guys took ad­van­tage of it. They played hard – a lot harder than us. We fought our way back, but just too many mis­takes.”</p>
    <p>The Heat will try to take a stran­gle­hold on the series in Game 3 to­day. No NBA team have ral­lied from a 0-3 deficit to win a series and that might have con­trib­uted to ten­sion in the Celtics’ locker room af­ter the de­feat.</p>
    <p>“Guys were emo­tional af­ter a hard game, hard loss,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the shout­ing that could be heard.</p>
    <p>Walker would not be drawn on re­ports that Mar­cus Smart let fly be­fore storm­ing out.</p>
    <p>“It was noth­ing,” he in­sisted, adding: “We’ll be fine.”</p>
    <p>Ta­tum in­sisted the Celtics will fo­cus on find­ing a way to win Game 3.</p>
    <p>“Two times now we’ve had dou­ble-digit leads and let go of the ropes,” he said. “We’ve got to fig­ure out why that keeps hap­pen­ing and just be pre­pared to win the next one.”</p>
