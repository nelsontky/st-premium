    <p>Can­dles and per­fume go hand in hand, so it comes as no sur­prise that be­spoke per­fume ate­lier Mai­son 21G now of­fers can­dles too.</p>
    <p>The Dual Can­dle ($150), cus­tomde­signed in Paris and launched this month, is a unique de­sign al­low­ing cus­tomers to com­bine two scents of their choice to form a full can­dle.</p>
    <p>Founder Jo­hanna Mo­nange, 45, had the idea during the cir­cuit breaker, af­ter re­ceiv­ing over­whelm­ing re­quests for can­dles. Just like her per­fumes which can be cus­tomised, the can­dles can have “lay­ered” scents.</p>
    <p>“It was to cus­tomise your home space,” says the French founder from her flag­ship bou­tique at Dux­ton Road.</p>
    <p>“Now you spend more time at home, so I re­ally wanted to take care of peo­ple at home.”</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion de­buted with eight scents cor­re­spond­ing to the fra­grances avail­able at Mai­son 21G, with plans to turn the full range of 38 scents into can­dles.</p>
    <p>A home scent should “bring you es­cape and com­fort, and good feel­ings”, says Ms Mo­nange, who also launched a nat­u­ral home scents range in May.</p>
    <p>De­mand for fra­grances has in­creased in this time, she ob­serves. Sales have been brisk for Mai­son 21G.</p>
    <p>In the past four months, she has opened two new stores – a bou­tique at Ion Or­chard and a counter at BHG Bugis Junc­tion – and part­nered ho­tels to con­duct per­fumemak­ing work­shops for stay­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>She also clinched a pop-up deal with Sephora at Ngee Ann City.</p>
    <p>Each of her three stores has been pulling in $50,000 in rev­enue a month, and is see­ing 30 per cent growth monthly.</p>
    <p>“A l ot of women don’t wear make-up now at home, and when you go out, you wear a mask – but peo­ple can still smell you. In the</p>
    <p>Mid­dle East, where the women are com­pletely covered, they are crazy about scents,” she notes.</p>
    <p>“I see an in­crease in the con­sump­tion of scents be­cause it’s a way to ex­press your per­son­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>It might also have to do with the evoca­tive na­ture of scents, which can bring es­cape during this year of no-travel, she says.</p>
    <p>“When I smell the ocean scent I think of the beach – it takes my mind out of a con­fined space. Scent takes you trav­el­ling; it brings you mem­o­ries and com­fort.”</p>
    <p>In the past, when she trav­elled of­ten for work, she would bot­tle the scent of her three sons to bring with her. To her, they smell of or­ange blos­som be­cause she slathers them in body prod­ucts with that fra­grance.</p>
    <p>“Scent con­nects your mind and body – it’s phys­i­o­log­i­cal and so pow­er­ful.”</p>
    <p>Some scents are sci­en­tif­i­cally proven to help your men­tal well­be­ing, adds the for­mer fra­grance creative di­rec­tor at Amer­i­can cor­po­ra­tion IFF (In­ter­na­tional Fla­vors & Fra­grances).</p>
    <p>Laven­der and neroli can re­lax you, while gin­ger can help en­er­gise you. The var­i­ous scent ben­e­fits and in­gre­di­ents are listed on Mai­son 21G’s web­site.</p>
    <p>De­spite its chal­lenges, Covid-19 gave her the down­time to brain­storm new prod­ucts and projects, she says.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, Ms Mo­nange hired 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans to help with the ex­pand­ing busi­ness. She is cur­rently in talks to open a fourth store at a lux­ury mall in spring next year.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing lessons her ex-boss im­parted in the 2009 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the ef­fer­ves­cent per­fumer adds: “During a cri­sis you work dou­ble, you in­vest.”</p>
