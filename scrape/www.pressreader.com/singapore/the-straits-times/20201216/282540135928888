    <p>THE SI­LENCE OF A FALL­ING TREE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Fes­ti­val Of Arts v2.020</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria The­atre, Sun­day</p>
    <p>The­atre is a com­mu­nion of the col­lec­tive imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>But what hap­pens when there is a forced sep­a­ra­tion of the com­mu­nal ex­pe­ri­ence?</p>
    <p>The last in­stal­ment of The Si­lence Of A Fall­ing Tree at­tempted to an­swer this ques­tion and the re­sult was an evoca­tive, lay­ered the­atri­cal ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>This show was part of a series of four au­dio ex­pe­ri­ences cre­ated by Com­pound, a col­lec­tive led by Young Artist Award re­cip­i­ent Ir­fan Kas­ban, for the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Fes­ti­val Of Arts’ v2.020 pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The first three episodes were purely dig­i­tal, thanks to the pan­demic-in­duced clo­sure of the­atres.</p>
    <p>But the last one brought par­tic­i­pants to the Vic­to­ria The­atre for a “live” stag­ing, as venues have re­opened with strict mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Each mem­ber of t he small au­di­ence was equipped with head­sets that var­i­ously glowed green, blue and red.</p>
    <p>So­cially dis­tanced in the dark­ened hall, each in­di­vid­ual was a part of, yet apart from, the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>The au­dio nar­ra­tive, open­ing “back­stage” with sounds of ac­tors do­ing vo­cal ex­er­cises and even burp­ing, si­mul­ta­ne­ously united and di­vided the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>In paint­ing word pic­tures of an empty stage, the work forced one to par­tic­i­pate in a shared act of imag­in­ing.</p>
    <p>But the nar­ra­tive, which called on lis­ten­ers to i mag­ine their child­hood homes in one part, also em­pha­sised the soli­tude of the in­di­vid­ual. This dichotomy was all the more vivid with every­one gath­ered to­gether i n a shared space.</p>
    <p>Yet this shared act of imag­in­ing also ig­nited cu­rios­ity and em­pa­thy – trig­gered by the nar­ra­tive as one re­called one’s child­hood and as­so­ci­ated mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>Seated i n a hall with other peo­ple at­tempt­ing the same act of rec­ol­lec­tion, one be­gan to won­der about their child­hoods as well.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous in­stal­ments of this series felt a bit hap­haz­ard and hes­i­tant in their ex­per­i­men­ta­tion with the au­dio plat­form and their au­di­ence of one.</p>
    <p>Track 1: The Tree, with its in­struc­tions to lie on the floor and fo­cus on breath­ing, came across like a yoga class.</p>
    <p>Track 2: The Fall­ing, which en­cour­aged lis­ten­ers to think about con­sump­tion in a su­per­mar­ket and in­structed them to en­gage with a su­per­mar­ket worker, felt like it was strain­ing for content.</p>
    <p>Track 3: The Si­lence worked bet­ter with its ex­hor­ta­tion to look at trees in a park and to con­sider the act of re­mem­ber­ing.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal track, pre-recorded but treated to sound “live”, raised fun­da­men­tal ques­tions about the cre­ation and con­sump­tion of the the­atre form.</p>
    <p>The au­dio for­mat may not seem the­atri­cal, but this stag­ing cer­tainly chal­lenged this as­sump­tion in thought-pro­vok­ing ways.</p>
