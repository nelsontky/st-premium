    <p>With Amer­i­can cin­ema at­ten­dance on the de­cline well be­fore Covid-19, Hol­ly­wood has long un­der­stood the im­por­tance of be­ing able to release a movie in the cov­eted China mar­ket, where only a few of its films are al­lowed to open in the­atres un­der a quota sys­tem.</p>
    <p>That mar­ket has be­come even more crit­i­cal to the sur­vival of big­bud­get Hol­ly­wood films i n the coro­n­avirus era. And no film shows this more than Dis­ney’s new live­ac­tion Mu­lan re­make, both in its pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>The movie, which cost US$200 mil­lion (S$272 mil­lion) to make and US$100 mil­lion to mar­ket, was ex­pected to earn more than US$1 bil­lion at box of­fices world­wide.</p>
    <p>With its tra­di­tional sen­si­bil­i­ties and a story that hews more closely to the orig­i­nal Chi­nese bal­lad than Dis­ney’s 1998 an­i­mated film Mu­lan, it has been cal­i­brated to ap­peal to Chi­nese movie­go­ers.</p>
    <p>Trade pub­li­ca­tion Va­ri­ety had re­ported that last year, United States ticket sales fell 4.4 per cent to US$11.4 bil­lion, while China’s 2019 box of­fice hit an all-time high of US$9.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>And with most US movie the­atres still closed be­cause of pan­demic re­stric­tions while most in China have re­opened, Dis­ney has un­veiled an un­prece­dented twotrack dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem for the new film.</p>
    <p>In China, it will open in the­atres on an as-yet-un­de­ter­mined date. But in the US, it will de­but as a premium release on the Dis­ney+ stream­ing plat­form, where sub­scribers can watch it for US$29.99, on top of their sub­scrip­tion fee, from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The move is a body blow to strug­gling North Amer­i­can the­atre op­er­a­tors, whose hopes for a sum­mer block­buster to bring back cin­ema­go­ers were first dashed when the Au­gust release of science-fiction film Tenet was post­poned to this month.</p>
    <p>And like Tenet, Mu­lan will be­come one of the first big Hol­ly­wood films to have its the­atri­cal pre­miere out­side the US, ar­riv­ing in cin­e­mas this week in coun­tries where the Dis­ney+ ser­vice is ei­ther not avail­able or not planned.</p>
    <p>With the the­atri­cal release i n China con­firmed a few weeks ago, the coun­try be­comes the sin­gle most im­por­tant the­atri­cal mar­ket for the film.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney chief ex­ec­u­tive Bob Chapek has de­scribed this hy­brid dis­tri­bu­tion model for Mu­lan as “a one-off”.</p>
    <p>But he added that the company finds it “very in­ter­est­ing to be able to take a new pre­miere ac­cess of­fer­ing to con­sumers at that US$29.99 price, learn from it and see what hap­pens”.</p>
    <p>Which sug­gests that if it does well, this could set a prece­dent for how other big Hol­ly­wood films are de­buted mov­ing for­ward.</p>
