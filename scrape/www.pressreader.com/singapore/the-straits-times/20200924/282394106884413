    <p>Aus­tralia’s foot­ball bosses and kit man­u­fac­turer Nike yes­ter­day promised fans that repli­cas of the national team’s away shirt would now be avail­able in women’s sizes next year af­ter a storm of out­rage from fans.</p>
    <p>The new uni­fied Soc­ceroos and Matil­das kit was l aunched with great fan­fare last week, but while the gold home shirt was avail­able in all sizes, the green away kit was not for sale in what Nike de­scribes as “women’s sil­hou­ettes”.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion Aus­tralia (FFA) had al­ready promised to rec­tify the anom­aly when the next kit was launched, but yes­ter­day it is­sued a state­ment say­ing that fe­male fans would soon be able to buy the away shirt. “FFA, to­gether with Nike, have lis­tened to fans and con­sumers and as a re­sult the away kit will be avail­able for pur­chase early in the new year,” it said.</p>
    <p>“The ini­tial un­avail­abil­ity of 2020 national teams away kits in a women’s sil­hou­ette was not con­sis­tent with the val­ues which FFA seeks to up­hold and pro­mote.</p>
    <p>“FFA ac­knowl­edges this and will place added em­pha­sis on en­sur­ing that fu­ture pro­cesses are aligned with the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s broader vi­sion and mis­sion for the sport.”</p>
    <p>Nike also re­leased a short state­ment con­firm­ing the news, say­ing it was “com­mit­ted to women’s foot­ball and serv­ing our fe­male ath­letes and con­sumers ”.</p>
    <p>Matil­das replica shirts can be ex­pected to be big sell­ers in the runup to Aus­tralia and New Zealand co-host­ing the next Women’s World Cup in 2023.</p>
