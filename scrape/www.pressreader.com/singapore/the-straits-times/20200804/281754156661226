    <p>GENEVA • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) warned yes­ter­day that there might never be a “sil­ver bul­let” for the coro­n­avirus, de­spite the rush to dis­cover ef­fec­tive vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The WHO urged gov­ern­ments and cit­i­zens to fo­cus on do­ing the known ba­sics, such as test­ing, con­tact trac­ing, main­tain­ing phys­i­cal dis­tance and wear­ing a mask, in or­der to sup­press the pan­demic, which has up­ended nor­mal life around the globe and trig­gered a dev­as­tat­ing eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We all hope to have a num­ber of ef­fec­tive vac­cines that can help pre­vent peo­ple from in­fec­tion,” WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus told a vir­tual press con­fer­ence. “How­ever, there is no sil­ver bul­let at the mo­ment – and there might never be. For now, stop­ping out­breaks comes down to the ba­sics of pub­lic health and dis­ease con­trol.”</p>
    <p>He urged: “Do it all.”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has killed nearly 690,000 peo­ple and in­fected at least 18.1 mil­lion since the outbreak was first de­tected in Wuhan in China last De­cem­ber, ac­cord­ing to a tally from of­fi­cial sources com­piled by Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The WHO be­gan press­ing China in early May to in­vite in its ex­perts to help in­ves­ti­gate the an­i­mal ori­gins of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The UN health agency sent an epi­demi­ol­o­gist and an an­i­mal health spe­cial­ist to Bei­jing on July 10 to lay the ground­work for a probe aimed at iden­ti­fy­ing how the virus en­tered the hu­man species.</p>
    <p>Their scop­ing mis­sion is now com­plete, said Dr Te­dros.</p>
    <p>“The WHO ad­vance team that trav­elled to China has now con­cluded its mis­sion to lay the ground­work for fur­ther joint ef­forts to iden­tify the virus ori­gins,” he said. “WHO and Chi­nese ex­perts have drafted the terms of ref­er­ence for the stud­ies and pro­gramme of work for an in­ter­na­tional team, led by WHO.</p>
    <p>“The in­ter­na­tional team will in­clude l ead­ing sci­en­tists and re­searchers from China and around the world. Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal stud­ies will be­gin in Wuhan to iden­tify the po­ten­tial source of in­fec­tion of the early cases. Ev­i­dence and hy­pothe­ses gen­er­ated through this work will l ay the ground for fur­ther, longer-term stud­ies.”</p>
    <p>The pair have not yet re­turned to the WHO’s Geneva head­quar­ters for a de­brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists be­lieve the killer virus jumped from an­i­mals to hu­mans, pos­si­bly from a mar­ket in the city of Wuhan sell­ing ex­otic an­i­mals for meat. Chi­nese of­fi­cials said early in the outbreak that the virus may have spread from a mar­ket in the city, which sold live and wild an­i­mals, but no fur­ther con­fir­ma­tion of that has been re­vealed.</p>
