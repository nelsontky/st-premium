    <p>Small and mi­cro busi­nesses sig­nif­i­cantly af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic will be able to rene­go­ti­ate cer­tain types of con­tracts with their coun­ter­par­ties from Jan 15 next year, the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They will have a six-week pe­riod to en­ter into rene­go­ti­a­tions by serv­ing no­tice of ne­go­ti­a­tion to the other party un­der the Re-Align Frame­work. The last day to do so will be Feb 26 next year.</p>
    <p>The frame­work was passed ur­gently in Par­lia­ment last month to help smaller busi­nesses cope with the fall­out from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>If ne­go­ti­a­tions are un­suc­cess­ful and the par­ties can­not come to an agree­ment, the con­tract will be ter­mi­nated early with­out penalty.</p>
    <p>A busi­ness is el­i­gi­ble for the ReAlign Frame­work if its an­nual rev­enue for fi­nan­cial year 2019 does not ex­ceed $30 mil­lion on a global group ba­sis. It must also have ex­pe­ri­enced at least a 70 per cent fall in monthly av­er­age gross in­come for July to this month, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Only cer­tain com­mer­cial con­tracts ap­ply un­der the frame­work. These in­clude leases or li­cences for com­mer­cial prop­erty, and hire-pur­chase and con­di­tional sales agree­ments for equip­ment or vehicles.</p>
    <p>The con­tract must be gov­erned by Sin­ga­pore law, and it must have been en­tered into be­fore March 25, with at least one party that has a place of busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The frame­work does not ap­ply to con­tracts ter­mi­nated be­fore Nov 2.</p>
    <p>A busi­ness that wants to in­voke the frame­work will have to serve a no­tice of ne­go­ti­a­tion on the other party or par­ties us­ing des­ig­nated forms from MinLaw dur­ing the spec­i­fied time­frame, and in­clude</p>
    <p>sup­port­ing doc­u­ments such as fi­nan­cial state­ments to prove its el­i­gi­bil­ity un­der the frame­work.</p>
    <p>In the four weeks after the date of the no­tice of ne­go­ti­a­tion, the busi­ness and the other con­trac­tual party must rene­go­ti­ate the terms of the con­tract.</p>
    <p>They are en­cour­aged to make full use of the four weeks to try to reach a com­pro­mise, said MinLaw.</p>
    <p>To avoid par­al­lel pro­ceed­ings on the same mat­ter while ne­go­ti­a­tions are in progress, the other party can­not, dur­ing the four weeks, take le­gal or en­force­ment ac­tions against</p>
    <p>the busi­ness for not per­form­ing its con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>If the two sides can­not come to an agree­ment on new terms, the con­trac­tual party may lodge an ob­jec­tion within two weeks after the ne­go­ti­a­tion pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>An as­ses­sor ap­pointed by MinLaw will then de­cide whether the busi­ness is el­i­gi­ble for the frame­work, as well as the par­ties’ obli­ga­tions upon ter­mi­nat­ing the con­tract.</p>
    <p>If none of the par­ties lodges and serves a no­tice of ob­jec­tion by the end of the two-week ob­jec­tion pe</p>
    <p>riod, the con­tract will be deemed ter­mi­nated after two days.</p>
    <p>Small land­lords will re­ceive com­pen­sa­tion at an amount de­cided by an as­ses­sor if their ten­ants ter­mi­nate their leases early un­der the Re-Align Frame­work.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify, the land­lord must be an in­di­vid­ual, a sole pro­pri­etor or a hold­ing com­pany of in­di­vid­u­als or sole pro­pri­etors, and have a monthly av­er­age rental in­come of more than half of the land­lord’s to­tal monthly av­er­age in­come.</p>
    <p>The an­nual in­di­vid­ual in­come must also not ex­ceed $107,500.</p>
    <p>Hir­ers and renters of com­mer­cial equip­ment or vehicles whose rev­enues have fallen by 70 per cent or more and are strug­gling to meet reg­u­lar pay­ments can opt for a re­pay­ment scheme – an in­stal­ment plan that will al­low them to pay their ac­crued ar­rears within 18 months.</p>
