    <p>Hun­dreds of Malaysians – from fac­tory work­ers to sales­men, elec­tri­cians, painters and car­pen­ters – have crossed the Cause­way to Sin­ga­pore for work since last Monday.</p>
    <p>The in­flow has come as a re­lief for many busi­nesses which lost their key staff when the border was closed on March 18.</p>
    <p>Ren­o­va­tion firms were one of the hard­est hit as about 80 per cent of their skilled work­force is from Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies in the sec­tor have had to shut for good, said Mr Sky Tan, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Ren­o­va­tion Con­trac­tors and Ma­te­rial Sup­pli­ers As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He cited cash flow is­sues as one of the rea­sons for the clo­sures.</p>
    <p>Most Malaysians in the ren­o­va­tion trade com­mute daily to Sin­ga­pore, he added.</p>
    <p>When the Malaysian gov­ern­ment closed the border in March after it saw a surge in Covid-19 cases, many of those work­ers were stuck at home while oth­ers sought tem­po­rary ac­com­mo­da­tion in Sin­ga­pore so they could con­tinue work­ing.</p>
    <p>But when Sin­ga­pore went into par­tial lock­down and cir­cuit breaker mea­sures kicked i n on April 7, more Malaysian work­ers re­turned home.</p>
    <p>“Hence, when Sin­ga­pore started re­open­ing the econ­omy in May, we couldn’t start work as many of our work­ers were stuck in Malaysia,” said Mr Al­loyious Koh, chief cre­ative con­sul­tant of Car­pen­ters De­sign Group.</p>
    <p>The staff short­age led to higher ren­o­va­tion costs and de­lays in com­plet­ing projects and col­lect­ing pay­ments. Some big­ger firms have had to down­size op­er­a­tions while oth­ers had to shut for good.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh said his com­pany has brought in around 20 work­ers un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment (PCA) scheme and they are now serv­ing a seven-day, stay­home no­tice. Once they re­turn to work – hope­fully next week – he is op­ti­mistic about get­ting op­er­a­tions back to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Lim­ited cross-border travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia un­der two schemes – the PCA and the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane (RGL) – be­gan last Monday.</p>
    <p>The RGL fa­cil­i­tates short-term travel for essen­tial busi­ness or of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween both sides for up to 14 days, while the PCA al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents with long-term im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work in the other coun­try to en­ter for work.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who en­ter un­der the PCA scheme must stay in the coun­try they work in for at least 90 days be­fore they can re­turn on home leave.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans and Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents do not need the PCA to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore. How­ever, they still need to serve stay­home no­tices that will be re­duced from 14 to seven days from Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Last week, Malaysian me­dia re­ported that the Malaysia au­thor­i­ties al­low a daily quota of 400 trav­ellers un­der RGL and 2,000 un­der PCA schemes. These quo­tas were reached in the first three days of the border re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try spokesman told The Sunday Times that the ap­pli­ca­tion for cross-border travel made through Jo­hor Im­mi­gra­tion Depart­ment is meant for travel from Sin­ga­pore to Malaysia, and dif­fers from the ap­pli­ca­tions made via the Safe Travel Por­tal for travel from Malaysia to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Malaysian As­so­ci­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Aarathi Aru­mugam finds the cost of travel un­der the PCA scheme too high and un­af­ford­able for peo­ple on lower in­comes.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty and risk are too high for them to un­der­take, she added, not­ing that if they re­turn to Malaysia (for home leave) and get in­fected with Covid-19, they might end up los­ing their jobs here.</p>
    <p>In pre-Covid-19 days, more than 100,000 Malaysians crossed the border daily to Sin­ga­pore to work in a wide va­ri­ety of jobs – chefs, hair­dressers, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers, con­struc­tion su­per­vi­sors and pro­fes­sion­als – be­fore re­turn­ing home at night.</p>
    <p>They were among the 300,000 or so peo­ple who used the Cause­way daily at that time.</p>
    <p>“The re­sump­tion of cross-border travel is, how­ever, still a trickle com­pared to... be­fore the pan­demic,” said May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the lim­ited ac­cess, re­open­ing the border “will help re­duce some of the worker short­ages faced by con­trac­tors, es­pe­cially for home ren­o­va­tions and re­pairs”, Dr Chua added.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy firm Il­lu­mina, which had sev­eral hun­dreds of Malaysian em­ploy­ees com­mut­ing here daily be­fore the pan­demic, was faced with the chal­lenge of oper­at­ing with far fewer staff when Malaysia closed its border.</p>
    <p>Il­lu­mina stayed op­er­a­tional dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and con­tin­ued to sup­ply prod­ucts to cus­tomers who needed them to com­bat Covid-19-re­lated ac­tiv­ity, a spokesman told The Sunday Times.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has since suc­cess­fully ap­plied for over 100 Malaysians to re­turn to work here. It is also pay­ing for the ac­com­mo­da­tion and trans­port of over 200 Malaysians work­ing here.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics gi­ant Gain City, which had 20 staff stuck in Malaysia, brought 10 back un­der the PCA scheme.</p>
    <p>Ms Feli­cia Ng, se­nior man­ager of spe­cial projects, said the firm has paid about $10,000 for ho­tel ac­com­mo­da­tion, meals and swab tests for the 10 staff, who are serv­ing the seven-day, stay-home no­tices.</p>
    <p>If the test re­sults come back neg­a­tive, these work­ers will stay with friends and rel­a­tives and start work this week, said Ms Ng.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Foo Tuck Hoe, 33, who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore last Monday, said the border re­open­ing has brought much hope to him and his fam­ily. Mr Foo, an air­con in­staller at Gain City, said he had been wor­ried about not hav­ing a sta­ble in­come after he found out in May that his wife was preg­nant.</p>
    <p>“I was so happy when the doc­tor told me my wife was preg­nant. I have been yearn­ing for a child. But two days later, I started to worry,” he said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo, who used to com­mute daily to Sin­ga­pore, is grate­ful to his em­ployer for pay­ing for his trip back: “The cost is un­af­ford­able to me. It’s equiv­a­lent to six months of my liv­ing ex­penses in Jo­hor.”</p>
