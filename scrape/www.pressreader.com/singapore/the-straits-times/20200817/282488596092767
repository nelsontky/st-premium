    <p>SAN­TI­AGO, CHILE • A pun on the Span­ish word for “honey” and the name of one of the world’s most fa­mous ac­tors has landed a smallscale Chilean ven­dor in a sticky sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Yo­hanna Agurto used an im­age of Mel Gib­son from the 1995 movie Brave­heart to pro­mote her honey, Miel Gib­son (above), along with the slo­gan “only for the brave”.</p>
    <p>Last week, she re­ceived a let­ter from the ac­tor’s lawyers, say­ing her use of his name and like­ness vi­o­lated his rights and threat­en­ing le­gal ac­tion if she did not with­draw the prod­uct im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>The let­ter was signed by an as­sis­tant to Cal­i­for­ni­abased lawyer Leigh Brecheen.</p>
    <p>Ms Brecheen told Reuters the let­ter was aimed at pre­vent­ing the use of Gib­son’s im­age, not ban­ning the honey’s name.</p>
    <p>“You need to get per­mis­sion to use or du­pli­cate a photo still from a film, which is owned by the stu­dio that re­leased the film,” she said. “None of this is meant to pre­vent any­one from earn­ing an in­come or cre­at­ing a busi­ness, but there are proper chan­nels to con­tact and clear­ances you need to go through to make sure you have the ap­proval for such us­age.”</p>
    <p>Ms Agurto told Reuters from her home in the cap­i­tal, San­ti­ago, that she was so fright­ened after re­ceiv­ing the let­ter last Wednesday that she deleted her work e-mail ac­count.</p>
    <p>She had started repack­ing and sell­ing the south­ern Chilean prod­uct only in June after the spread of the coro­n­avirus caused wide­spread un­em­ploy­ment, she said, adding that she earned only enough to sup­port her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“This arose out of ne­ces­sity. I was left without work due to the pan­demic,” she said.</p>
    <p>After she shared the let­ter with Chilean me­dia, she said, her fol­low­ing on so­cial me­dia grew “ex­po­nen­tially”.</p>
    <p>Last Thursday, she ad­dressed an ap­peal di­rectly to the ac­tor on Twit­ter: “Dear #MelGib­son, would you let us use your im­age on our honey please? Mis kids and me we would be in­fin­itely grate­ful. Our honey is only for brave hearts.”</p>
    <p>Gib­son’s spokesman did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
