    <p>Malaysia has an­nounced stiffer penal­ties for mo­torists who cause death due to reck­less­ness or while driv­ing un­der the in­flu­ence of al­co­hol and drugs in the Road Trans­port (Amend­ment) Bill 2020. The Bill was passed on Wed­nes­day in the De­wan Rakyat with a sim­ple voice vote.</p>
    <p>• Malaysia has an­nounced stiffer penal­ties for mo­torists who cause death due to reck­less­ness or while driv­ing un­der the in­flu­ence of al­co­hol and drugs in the Road Trans­port (Amend­ment) Bill 2020. The Bill was passed on Wed­nes­day in the De­wan Rakyat with a sim­ple voice vote.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Wee Ka Siong said the leg­isla­tive amend­ments were done in a com­pre­hen­sive man­ner to tackle the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>He em­pha­sised that the law was not meant to de­prive peo­ple of their right to con­sume al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter to me if you want to drink all you want and even swim in a pool of al­co­hol, but it be­comes my con­cern when you drive af­ter do­ing so,” Datuk Seri Wee said in his min­is­te­rial re­ply on the Bill on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Bill pro­posed that those charged un­der Sec­tion 41 for dan­ger­ous or reck­less driv­ing caus­ing death could face be­tween five and 10 years’ jail, as well as a fine of not less than RM20,000 (S$6,530) and not more than RM50,000.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, those guilty of the of­fence face be­tween two and 10 years of jail time and a fine of be­tween RM5,000 and RM20,000.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers will also have their driv­ing li­cence sus­pended for five years if con­victed, an in­crease of three years com­pared with two years pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>The Bill pro­posed that those charged un­der Sec­tion 43 for care­less and in­con­sid­er­ate driv­ing also face a fine of be­tween RM5,000 and RM10,000, as well as a jail term of not more than 12 months for the first of­fence.</p>
    <p>An­other amend­ment states that any­one who drives a mo­tor ve­hi­cle un­der the i nflu­ence of al­co­hol, liquor or drugs to the ex­tent of be­ing in­ca­pable of hav­ing proper con­trol over the ve­hi­cle, or has an al­co­hol con­tent ex­ceed­ing the limit, and causes a death, can be jailed for be­tween 10 and 15 years, and fined be­tween RM50,000 and RM100,000.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed un­der this sec­tion will also be dis­qual­i­fied from hold­ing or ob­tain­ing a driv­ing li­cence for 10 years from the date of con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>Those who drive a mo­tor ve­hi­cle un­der the in­flu­ence of al­co­hol, liquor or drugs to the ex­tent of be­ing in­ca­pable of hav­ing proper con­trol over the ve­hi­cle, or has an al­co­hol con­tent ex­ceed­ing the limit, and cause in­jury to any­one, will also be pros­e­cuted. They shall be li­able to a jail term of be­tween seven and 10 years and a fine of be­tween RM30,000 and RM50,000.</p>
    <p>The Bill also sought to amend Sec­tion 45G to lower the pre­scribed limit of al­co­hol con­tent al­lowed in an in­di­vid­ual to 22mg of al­co­hol in 100ml of breath; 50mg of al­co­hol in 100ml of blood; or 67mg of al­co­hol in 100ml of urine.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the pre­scribed limit of al­co­hol con­tent al­lowed in an in­di­vid­ual is 35mg of al­co­hol in 100ml of breath; 80mg of al­co­hol in 100ml of blood; or 107mg of al­co­hol in 100ml of urine.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee said the gov­ern­ment was us­ing not only leg­is­la­tion to ad­dress the is­sue but also the three el­e­ments of ed­u­ca­tion, en­gi­neer­ing of road con­di­tions, and enforcemen­t.</p>
    <p>“We can­not use only one of the el­e­ments or ne­glect all of them. When there is aware­ness and enforcemen­t is done, then peo­ple will be more afraid to get be­hind the wheel af­ter drink­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee de­nied that the in­crease in penal­ties was aimed to boost gov­ern­ment rev­enue, adding that the pun­ish­ments were meant to de­ter reck­less driv­ing or driv­ing un­der the in­flu­ence of al­co­hol and drugs.</p>
    <p>He said dis­cus­sions were be­ing held with e-hail­ing com­pa­nies to dis­play stick­ers on their ve­hi­cles to en­cour­age those un­der the in­flu­ence of al­co­hol to use their ser­vices in­stead of driv­ing them­selves.</p>
    <p>WHEN IT CON­CERNS THE MIN­IS­TER</p>
    <p>It doesn’t mat­ter to me if you want to drink all you want and even swim in a pool of al­co­hol, but it be­comes my con­cern when you drive af­ter do­ing so.</p>
