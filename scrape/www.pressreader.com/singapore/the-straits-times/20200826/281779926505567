    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day ex­tended the city’s strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules for an­other two days, but will ease some restric­tions from Friday, as lo­cal Covid-19 trans­mis­sions de­clined in the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>Un­less there are dras­tic changes to the epi­demic sit­u­a­tion in the next two days, din­ing-in ser­vices at eater­ies will be ex­tended from the cur­rent 6pm to 9pm from Friday for a week, with each ta­ble capped at two pa­trons.</p>
    <p>Some busi­nesses pre­vi­ously or­dered to shut, in­clud­ing cin­e­mas, beauty par­lours and some sports premises, will also be al­lowed to re­open.</p>
    <p>The manda­tory mask-wear­ing rule stays but peo­ple ex­er­cis­ing in parks will be al­lowed ex­emp­tions, as well as those en­gag­ing in stren­u­ous ex­er­cise in out­door spaces.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day came as the so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules – the strictest so far in the city’s ef­forts against the coronaviru­s – were to ex­pire at mid­night.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said the num­ber of daily cases has dropped but stressed that the city is not out of the woods yet.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chan urged res­i­dents not to let their guard down and en­cour­aged peo­ple to take up the free univer­sal com­mu­nity test­ing for Covid-19 to be rolled out by the gov­ern­ment from Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam hit back at health ex­perts who crit­i­cised the univer­sal test­ing pro­gramme – a move she said is po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, some med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als have raised doubts about the ef­fec­tive­ness of the free tests that would be car­ried out with the help of a med­i­cal team from the main­land.</p>
    <p>The crit­ics noted that the tests would not con­tain the out­break and might raise the prospects of trans­mis­sions through the mass ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing ahead of the weekly Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil meet­ing, Mrs Lam said: “As far as univer­sal com­mu­nal test­ing is con­cerned, we are not cram­ming it into a sin­gle day. We have al­lowed our­selves up to two weeks to in­vite mem­bers of the com­mu­nity to come for­ward for the test­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­less there are dras­tic changes to the epi­demic sit­u­a­tion in the next two days, din­ing-in ser­vices at eater­ies will be ex­tended from the cur­rent 6pm to 9pm from Friday for a week, with each ta­ble capped at two pa­trons. The manda­tory mask-wear­ing rule stays but peo­ple ex­er­cis­ing in parks will be al­lowed ex­emp­tions, as well as those en­gag­ing in stren­u­ous ex­er­cise in out­door spaces.</p>
    <p>“Se­condly, we are go­ing to do an on­line book­ing sys­tem. So prefer­ably we won’t be see­ing crowds or long queues in front of the swab­bing sta­tions to have the test done,” she added.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment to ease rules comes on the back of fewer new in­fec­tions in the city’s third wave of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s con­firmed daily Covid-19 tally has steadily de­clined from the highs of more than 100 three weeks ago to Monday’s nine new in­fec­tions. Of the nine, seven were lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>It recorded 19 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, of which 16 were lo­cal cases, bring­ing the to­tal tally to 4,710, in­clud­ing over 70 deaths.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, or­gan­is­ers of the Hong Kong Book Fair, which was post­poned last month due to the third wave of coronaviru­s, an­nounced yes­ter­day that the event will go ahead from Dec 16 to 22 at the Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>On Monday, Univer­sity of Hong Kong re­searchers said they have doc­u­mented the world’s first con­firmed case of coronaviru­s re-in­fec­tion, with ge­netic se­quenc­ing show­ing dif­fer­ent strains of the virus.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old man, who works in IT, re­cov­ered from Covid-19 in April only to test pos­i­tive again this month af­ter re­turn­ing to Hong Kong from a Spain trip.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers noted that pa­tients who get re-in­fected can spread the virus to oth­ers and make the con­tain­ment of the pan­demic harder.</p>
