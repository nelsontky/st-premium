    <p>Jobs are a core pri­or­ity for Sin­ga­pore, and labour MP Pa­trick Tay is en­cour­aged by the calls from MPs and pledges by min­is­ters over the past week to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans are treated fairly in a chal­leng­ing econ­omy, and that low-wage work­ers get the sup­port they need.</p>
    <p>In a speech wrap­ping up five days of ro­bust de­bate, Mr Tay (Pi­o­neer), who is as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral at the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, noted the many MPs who ar­gued for more to be done to strengthen the Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>“In fact, I was do­ing a count as we pro­gressed through the speeches – and the phrase ‘Sin­ga­porean core’ has been men­tioned over 40 times in the last four days alone,” he said.</p>
    <p>MPs had sought as­sur­ances that safe­guard­ing jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans will con­tinue to be a key fo­cus, even as they ac­knowl­edged that Sin­ga­pore can­not fully look in­wards.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay was heart­ened that Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo had said her min­istry will be re­view­ing com­pa­nies whose Sin­ga­porean core is weak­en­ing, while Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung had said the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore will en­sure fair hir­ing prac­tices while groom­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans to be lead­ers and spe­cial­ists in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tay: “I take heart that ev­ery call to strengthen our Sin­ga­porean core made in these cham­bers has not been a call to di­vide, but one to unite.”</p>
    <p>He also summed up what 74 MPs spoke about in the past five days.</p>
    <p>The lively de­bate saw Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party and op­po­si­tion MPs cross swords on top­ics such as com­pas­sion­ate pol­i­cy­mak­ing and a re­view of race-based poli­cies, while cham­pi­oning is­sues such as a safer on­line space, a more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly Sin­ga­pore and greater sup­port for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Other MPs raised the im­por­tance of en­sur­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal and eco­nomic sus­tain­abil­ity, and the need for trans­for­ma­tion of busi­nesses and the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>They high­lighted that equip­ping the work­force with the right skills and mind­sets is cru­cial for driv­ing this trans­for­ma­tion, said Mr Tay.</p>
    <p>“As we re­view and for­mu­late strate­gies for in­dus­tries to trans­form and di­ver­sify, we will need to cre­ate an even stronger link­age in the form of skills maps, job re­design, job re­train­ing and reskilling of our work­ers to take on these jobs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Other top­ics raised in­clude a strong call for a fair, just, in­clu­sive and co­he­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay noted that the new so­cial com­pact must be prac­ti­cal, while bal­anc­ing the needs of Sin­ga­pore­ans in the ar­eas of so­cial se­cu­rity, af­ford­able and qual­ity hous­ing, health­care, ed­u­ca­tion, pub­lic in­fra­struc­ture and the en­vi­ron­ment with their as­pi­ra­tions and dreams.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral MPs also spoke up for women, ac­knowl­edg­ing the need for recog­ni­tion of the trade-offs and sac­ri­fices they make in their ca­reers, and of the bias and strug­gles they face in re-en­ter­ing the work­force af­ter hav­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said he was “es­pe­cially re­minded” of the is­sue by the ex­am­ple of Oa­sis Wa­ter Park in Nee Soon East, cited by Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) to make a point on gen­der stereo­types.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said in his speech on Wed­nes­day that when the park opened last year, the di­a­per chang­ing room was in­stalled only in the women’s toi­let, and when asked why, the builders said women were the ones who changed di­a­pers. The is­sue was re­solved with the in­stal­la­tion of a se­cond di­a­per chang­ing room in the toi­let for the dis­abled.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tay: “Re­lated to gen­der and poverty is a larger con­ver­sa­tion about dis­crim­i­na­tion in our so­ci­ety. We need to ex­pand our em­pa­thy to our mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>He added that deep trust and mu­tual re­spect are needed among Sin­ga­pore­ans, who have to re­spect Sin­ga­pore’s plu­ral­ity. “Our first pres­i­dent Yu­sof Ishak did not see our di­ver­sity of race, lan­guage, re­li­gion as an ob­sta­cle to progress. He saw this as our strength. He saw this di­ver­sity as ex­actly what would make Sin­ga­pore dy­namic and pro­gres­sive.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore should con­tinue in this direc­tion, he added, urg­ing cit­i­zens to come to­gether to build a live­able and sus­tain­able so­ci­ety and coun­try founded on mu­tual trust, with op­por­tu­ni­ties for all.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay quoted the lyrics of a trib­ute song, Sin­ga­pore, Unite As One, by Fair­field Methodist Pri­mary School Pri­mary 6 pupil Ja­cob Neo: “But we’ll be to­gether through thick and the thin, as one coun­try we’ll fight this virus and win. We’ll fight with our hearts and our minds and our souls, pro­tect­ing this is­land where we call our home.”</p>
    <p>Added the MP: “Let us con­tinue to have faith and be of good courage, lis­ten well, look out for one an­other. Stay strong, and com­mu­ni­cate with grace and em­pa­thy.”</p>

    <p>I was do­ing a count as we pro­gressed through the speeches – and the phrase ‘Sin­ga­porean core’ has been men­tioned over 40 times in the last four days alone.</p>
