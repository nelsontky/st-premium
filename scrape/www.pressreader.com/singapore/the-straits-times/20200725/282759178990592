    <p>The made-in-Malaysia Pero­dua Myvi is a com­mon sight across the Cause­way.</p>
    <p>The hatch­back was launched in 2005 as a joint col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Malaysian car­maker Pero­dua and Ja­pan’s Dai­hatsu Mo­tor. It has spanned three gen­er­a­tions and is Malaysia’s best-sell­ing car of the decade – from 2010 to last year.</p>
    <p>De­spite its ru­n­away suc­cess on its home turf, the Myvi is a rare sight in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pero­dua’s long-time Sin­ga­pore dealer Pe­ro­com Auto has rep­re­sented the brand here since 2003 af­ter the then-Com­fort Group, which held the Pero­dua fran­chise, ex­ited the car re­tail in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Since 2016, Pe­ro­com has sold about 260 new Pero­d­uas, ac­cord­ing to Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity data.</p>
    <p>That is about the av­er­age num­ber of new Toy­otas – a largely breadand-but­ter car brand – sold weekly by Bor­neo Mo­tors and par­al­lel im­porters last year.</p>
    <p>Pe­ro­com has a two-car line-up here: the Bezza sedan and the Myvi.</p>
    <p>They are the two cheap­est cars in Sin­ga­pore – the Bezza costs $57,999 and the 1.3-litre Myvi costs $61,999.</p>
    <p>The Myvi re­viewed here is the 1.5-litre vari­ant, which costs $4,000 more than the 1.3-litre ver­sion.</p>
    <p>It is the first Pero­dua car test­driven by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>When I get into the cabin, the fea­ture that catches my eye is a small hook at the side of the front pas­sen­ger’s seat near the driver. It is an anti-snatch hand­bag hook that can take a load of up to 3kg.</p>
    <p>It must have been de­signed so that drivers can hang their hand­bags there in­stead of leav­ing them on the front pas­sen­ger seat, which may in­vite smash-and-grab thefts.</p>
    <p>But I can eas­ily think of two other uses for the hook: for plas­tic bags in which I can sip my drink through a straw, and bags con­tain­ing take­away food.</p>
    <p>I show a photo of the hook to a friend and he says: “You wouldn’t see such a hook in Euro­pean cars as the drivers and pas­sen­gers there are more atas (Malay for so­phis­ti­cated). They use plas­tic cups whereas we use plas­tic bags.”</p>
    <p>It is a clever ex­am­ple of how, while Myvi may have started its life as a Dai­hatsu Sirion clone, it has been lo­calised to suit spe­cific needs.</p>
    <p>The third-gen­er­a­tion Myvi, launched in Malaysia in 2017 and of­fi­cially sold in Sin­ga­pore since</p>
    <p>April last year, is de­signed in-house rather than re­badg­ing the Dai­hatsu Sirion. The car has youth­ful styling, in­clud­ing fac­tory-fit­ted front bumper lip ex­ten­sion and side skirts.</p>
    <p>Size-wise, the Myvi is 104mm shorter in length (3,895mm versus 3,999mm) and 153mm shorter in height (1,515mm versus 1,668mm) than the Honda Jazz.</p>
    <p>Its wheel­base is also 30mm shorter than the Jazz’s 2,530mm, which means cabin space is less roomy and tighter head­room than the bench­mark-set­ting Jazz.</p>
    <p>The equip­ment level of the Myvi sur­prises me.</p>
    <p>The test-car has mod­ern ameni­ties such as key­less en­try and ig­ni­tion, steer­ing-mounted au­dio con­trols, front-park­ing sen­sors, re­verse-park­ing cam­era and fold­ing wing mir­rors.</p>
    <p>It also has six airbags and the usual safety fea­tures, such as trac­tion con­trol, anti-lock brak­ing sys­tem and hill-start as­sist, to pre­vent the car from rolling back­wards on a slope.</p>
    <p>The Myvi’s 1.5-litre power plant is sourced from Toy­ota, which should pro­vide some as­sur­ance of qual­ity. The five-year 150,000km warranty pro­vides ad­di­tional peace of mind.</p>
    <p>The Myvi’s fuel con­sump­tion is im­pres­sive – I achieve 6.3 litres/ 100km over the one-day, 105km test-drive – not too far off the of­fi­cial fig­ure of 5.6 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>But the drive is not as fun as I expect from a small hatch­back. The steer­ing is not en­gag­ing and pi­lot­ing the nu­mer­ous bends and a hair­pin in Neo Tiew, a route I have driven count­less times, was func­tional rather than en­joy­able.</p>
    <p>While gearshifts are rea­son­ably smooth, the four-speed au­to­matic gear­box lacks a fifth gear, which would have im­proved fuel econ­omy and re­fine­ment.</p>
    <p>Sub­jec­tively, the ac­cel­er­a­tion feels a notch lower than brisk. Af­ter the drive, I could not find the cen­tury-sprint tim­ing and top speed in the brochure, so I seek the of­fi­cial fig­ures from Pe­ro­com.</p>
    <p>The re­ply is un­ex­pected.</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­pore mo­tor­ing jour­nal­ist asked for the same data pre­vi­ously and Pero­dua gives the same re­ply to ST via a Pe­ro­com staff mem­ber: “Per­for­mance fig­ure like speed and oth­ers are rarely pub­lished.”</p>
    <p>The Pero­dua em­ployee adds that such per­for­mance fig­ures vary and drivers some­times claim that they can­not achieve the man­u­fac­turer’s fig­ures.</p>
    <p>I re­spond: “It is not true that per­for­mance fig­ures are rarely pub­lished. They are al­ways pub­lished.”</p>
    <p>With­out the of­fi­cial fig­ures, my guess is that the Myvi’s cen­tu­rysprint time should be about 12 sec­onds and top speed about 170kmh.</p>
    <p>These were the per­for­mance fig­ures of the 2013 third-gen­er­a­tion Toy­ota Vios, which had a sim­i­lar 1.5-litre power plant and four-speed au­to­matic gear­box.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the test-drive and mulling over a few days, I think I un­der­stand what might be pre­vent­ing the Myvi from be­com­ing pop­u­lar in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Myvi costs about $14,000 in Malaysia. As a do­mes­tic prod­uct, it is no­tably suc­cess­ful in meet­ing lo­cal ex­pec­ta­tions, in­clud­ing buy­ers who do not care to know how their cars are sup­posed to per­form.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore is a dif­fer­ent mar­ket. The prices of the Myvi here are more than four times those in Malaysia, due to var­i­ous taxes and cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>So, while the Myvi may be the cheap­est hatch­back in Sin­ga­pore, it faces in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion from the Thai-made Mit­subishi At­trage, which costs about the same, and the Ja­pan-made Swift, which costs just $7,000 more.</p>
    <p>The Myvi may ap­peal to Sin­ga­pore drivers on an ex­tremely tight bud­get, reeled in by the $7,000 in cost sav­ings and the lower costs of ser­vic­ing their rides in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>For those who look at car-buy­ing as a com­plete pack­age, the cheap­est price tag is not nec­es­sar­ily the main hook here.</p>
