    <p>Pas­sen­gers headed to Guangzhou early yes­ter­day morn­ing ap­peared to have no is­sues board­ing Scoot Flight TR100 de­spite hav­ing had to scram­ble to un­dergo last-minute Covid-19 tests af­ter the Chi­nese Em­bassy an­nounced new re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>No pas­sen­ger was turned away from the 5.15am flight when The Straits Times vis­ited Changi Air­port at around 2am yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When asked if all pas­sen­gers were al­lowed to board, Scoot would say only that the flight departed with 254 pas­sen­gers and two in­fants.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the week, scores of anx­ious pas­sen­gers with a seat on the Scoot flight, as well as other Chin­abound flights, had turned up at the former Shuqun Se­condary School to be tested for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This came af­ter an Aug 21 an­nounce­ment by the Chi­nese Em­bassy that from Aug 28, all trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore to China will have to take a Covid-19 test within five days of their flight to en­sure they are free of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers booked on Flight TR100 were alerted to the new re­quire­ment in an ur­gent e-mail sent by Scoot last Tues­day. They were in­structed to go for the test at the re­gional screen­ing cen­tre lo­cated at the site of the former school in Jurong East on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers had to also de­clare that, in the last 14 days, they did not have a fever at or above 37.3 deg C, and had not been in con­tact with pa­tients with a fever or res­pi­ra­tory symp­toms, among other things.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese na­tional Ren Peng Ju, 30, who has lived in Sin­ga­pore for the past 10 years, took the test.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren, who works in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, said his com­pany bore the cost of his Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers tak­ing the test at the cen­tre must pay $186 be­fore their test re­sults can be re­leased to them.</p>
    <p>Mr Ren said in Man­darin be­fore en­ter­ing the de­par­ture hall yes­ter­day: “I went for the test on Wed­nes­day af­ter re­ceiv­ing the e-mail but ev­ery­thing went pretty smoothly. I was ac­tu­ally quite thank­ful for the ar­range­ments and am glad to be go­ing home.”</p>
    <p>The Shan­dong na­tive added that he was re­turn­ing to China for good, with plans to start his own busi­ness there. “The coro­n­avirus af­fected (the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor) pretty badly, in terms of jobs and salary.</p>
    <p>China has been de­vel­op­ing well, there are more op­por­tu­ni­ties there, and I think it is time to go back.”</p>
    <p>An­other Chi­nese couple said they took the test last Thurs­day upon re­ceiv­ing Scoot’s e-mail.</p>
    <p>Mr He Jian Bing, 36, who works in ad­ver­tis­ing, had to bear the cost him­self. But his wife, who is in the elec­tron­ics in­dus­try, said her com­pany paid for hers. Mr He said: “The test­ing process was very smooth. I think Sin­ga­pore did very well.”</p>
    <p>Some pas­sen­gers said they heard about the Chi­nese Em­bassy’s new re­quire­ments be­fore Scoot sent out its e-mail.</p>
    <p>Designer Jas­mine Chen, a China na­tional and Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, said she made ar­range­ments to take the Covid-19 test at Mount Elizabeth Hos­pi­tal last Tues­day af­ter reading about the re­quire­ment on­line.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old said: “I read about it on­line. It was quite last-minute and in­con­ve­nient, but I man­aged to get the test done in time.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Chen, who has a Sin­ga­porean hus­band, said she is go­ing back to China to visit family. She will re­turn in about two months and has booked a flight, she added.</p>
    <p>The first China-bound flight af­ter the new rules kicked in – Air China Flight CA768 to Hangzhou – made the trip from Sin­ga­pore last Friday with 47 pas­sen­gers on board.</p>
