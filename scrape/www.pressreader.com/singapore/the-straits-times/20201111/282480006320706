    <p>Premier League chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Masters has de­fended the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s cur­rent Covid-19 bailout of­fer for English Foot­ball League (EFL) teams, say­ing “scarce re­sources” among elite clubs is a rea­son for dead­lock over the fund­ing pack­age.</p>
    <p>The EFL, which rep­re­sents the three di­vi­sions be­low the Premier League, last month re­jected a £50 mil­lion (S$89 mil­lion) of­fer from the top flight for League One and League Two clubs, say­ing that it wanted a deal which cov­ered all of its teams. Al­though the Premier League’s ini­tial of­fer was for third and fourth-tier clubs, share­hold­ers last week added that they were will­ing to sup­port any Cham­pi­onship club fac­ing fi­nan­cial strain amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Our of­fer goes to the is­sue of ‘need’ rather than ‘ want’, and where you have scarce re­sources in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment, that has to be the right ap­proach,” Masters told Politico.</p>
    <p>“It also mir­rors the UK gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach – res­cu­ing other ar­eas of sport, and in­deed the econ­omy, to save bits from go­ing out of busi­ness, rather than to un­der­write losses.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, there isn’t an agree­ment – but we stand will­ing to con­tinue to talk, and our of­fer re­mains on the ta­ble to save clubs if they are in sig­nif­i­cant Covid-re­lated dis­tress.”</p>
    <p>He has pro­jected that the topflight clubs are miss­ing out on a com­bined £20 mil­lion of pro­jected rev­enue for each round of matches played with­out fans.</p>
    <p>De­spite the fi­nan­cial cri­sis, Premier League clubs spent over £1 bil­lion on buy­ing play­ers in the close-sea­son trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Masters de­fended the spend­ing as nec­es­sary to main­tain a com­pet­i­tive edge.</p>
    <p>“You have to con­tinue to com­pete, you have to con­tinue to in­vest,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment is hold­ing back on any in­ter­ven­tion and has called on the Premier League to take the lead in help­ing out clubs in the lower reaches.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said on Mon­day: “We’ve been clear right from the out­set that we ex­pect foot­ball to sup­port it­self...</p>
    <p>“I think we do want to see progress (in talks), par­tic­u­larly when Premier League clubs have spent over £1 bil­lion on play­ers in the re­cent trans­fer win­dow.”</p>
