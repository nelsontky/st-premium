    <p>The priest who was the face of hun­dreds of hostages taken by Mus­lim mil­i­tants dur­ing the dis­as­trous siege of the south­ern Philip­pine city of Marawi more than three years ago died yesterday.</p>
    <p>Fa­ther Tere­sito So­ganub had suf­fered a car­diac ar­rest in his home town of No­ralah, in South Cotabato prov­ince, in war-torn Min­danao is­land. He was 59.</p>
    <p>He was vicar-gen­eral of the Catholic prela­ture of Marawi when more than a thou­sand mil­i­tants, with ties to the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria, stormed the pre­dom­i­nantly Mus­lim city in May 2017.</p>
    <p>They held on to it for five months in what be­came the big­gest and dead­li­est battle on Philip­pine soil since World War II.</p>
    <p>Fa­ther So­ganub was seized from his church with 23 oth­ers, with hun­dreds more rounded up and used as “hu­man shields” by the mil­i­tants.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands hid in­side their homes in Marawi and were un­able to flee when fierce fight­ing erupted be­tween an en­trenched group of fight­ers trained in ur­ban war­fare and bat­tal­ions of sol­diers backed by tanks and war­planes.</p>
    <p>A video of Fa­ther So­ganub sur­faced as clashes peaked weeks into the fight­ing.</p>
    <p>In it, he pleaded on be­half of his fel­low hostages for the mil­i­tary to stop the air bom­bard­ments.</p>
    <p>He also aired the mil­i­tants’ warn­ing that they would ex­e­cute their hostages if the shelling con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>That came as other videos emerged show­ing the mil­i­tants shoot­ing their hostages in the head or be­head­ing them.</p>
    <p>Four months after he was taken, Fa­ther So­ganub and a church helper found an op­por­tu­nity to es­cape when se­cu­rity forces closed in on a mosque where the two were be­ing held. They ran to a tank that was just 50m away. He made it, but the helper did not.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial tally records 87 hostages killed. But it is be­lieved the ac­tual num­ber could be much higher.</p>
    <p>Fa­ther So­ganub later said in an in­ter­view that he was forced to con­vert to Is­lam, and cook and carry guns and mu­ni­tions for the mil­i­tants. “I was not afraid to die, but I was afraid to suf­fer,” he told the Catholic-owned UCANews, a year after his rescue.</p>
    <p>He said he reached a point where he doubted his faith and asked God why he was be­ing tested so se­verely.</p>
    <p>“I was an­gry with God for putting me in such a hor­ri­ble sit­u­a­tion. How­ever, my faith in the Lord did not wa­ver. In fact, it even be­came deeper. I prayed more fever­ishly than I used to do, with death star­ing us straight in the face.”</p>
    <p>Fa­ther So­ganub took leave from his du­ties as a priest and be­gan tour­ing the coun­try to pro­mote in­ter-re­li­gious dia­logue be­tween Catholics and Mus­lims. “I am still a priest but no spe­cific as­sign­ment,” he told the Philip­pine Daily In­quirer last month.</p>
    <p>He said he asked to be re­turned to his post in Marawi but his boss, Bishop Ed­win de la Pena, told him to con­tinue his heal­ing process.</p>
    <p>The priest was with his family when he died in his sleep.</p>
    <p>When the siege ended in Oc­to­ber 2017, half of Marawi lay in ru­ins. Till now, some 60,000 peo­ple are still liv­ing in tem­po­rary shel­ters.</p>
