    <p>Malaysia’s largest palm oil com­pany FGV Hold­ings de­fended its labour prac­tices yes­ter­day, say­ing it was dis­ap­pointed with the United States au­thor­i­ties for ban­ning im­ports from the com­pany, cit­ing forced labour.</p>
    <p>FGV, the world’s largest crude palm-oil pro­ducer, said it has worked to­wards rec­ti­fy­ing its labour stan­dards pro­gres­sively since 2015, and it will con­tinue to en­gage the US Cus­toms and Bor­der Pro­tec­tion to clear the com­pany’s name.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the US agency said it was is­su­ing a with­hold re­lease or­der on prod­ucts from FGV af­ter find­ing in­di­ca­tions of forced labour in its pro­duc­tion process.</p>
    <p>The or­der came just over a week af­ter a re­port in As­so­ci­ated Press al­leged wide­spread hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions in oil palm plan­ta­tions in Malaysia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“FGV is dis­ap­pointed that such a de­ci­sion has been made when FGV has been tak­ing con­crete steps over the past sev­eral years in demon­strat­ing its com­mit­ment to re­spect hu­man rights and up­hold labour stan­dards,” the com­pany said. It noted that its ef­forts have been “well doc­u­mented” and the is­sues raised by the re­port have been the sub­ject of pub­lic dis­course since 2015.</p>
    <p>It stressed on the dif­fer­ence be­tween its op­er­a­tions and those of the Fed­eral Land De­vel­op­ment Author­ity (Felda), a govern­ment agency that is FGV’s big­gest share­holder.</p>
    <p>The AP re­port doc­u­mented labour prac­tices in oil palm plan­ta­tions linked to Felda. “FGV would like to clar­ify that it is not the com­mer­cial arm of Felda,” the com­pany had said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Felda owns 34 per cent of FGV’s shares, but FGV stressed that its op­er­a­tions are “unique and in­de­pen­dent”. It claimed that it does not em­ploy refugees among its 15,000 for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>The AP re­port al­leged that some of the ex­ploited work­ers in Malaysian plan­ta­tions are Ro­hingya refugees. FGV de­nied hold­ing its work­ers’ pass­ports, another claim that sur­faced in the re­port.</p>
    <p>The North Amer­ica sec­tor, in­clud­ing Canada, ac­counted for 5 per cent of FGV’s to­tal rev­enue last year and is val­ued at RM700 mil­lion (S$230 mil­lion), down from RM800 mil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>FGV has an oleo­chem­i­cal plant in in Wash­ing­ton in the US which pro­duces prod­ucts such as fatty acid cuts. The plant is the third-largest oleo­chem­i­cal player in North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>FGV was pre­vi­ously known as the global arm of Felda be­fore it was listed as Felda Global Ven­tures in 2012, in an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing val­ued at RM10 bil­lion, the sec­ond-big­gest IPO that year af­ter Face­book, and the big­gest in Asia.</p>
    <p>A Wall Street Jour­nal re­port in 2015 also al­leged poor labour stan­dards in FGV plan­ta­tions, and the com­pany said it has since in­vested in rec­ti­fy­ing its labour stan­dards.</p>
    <p>“FGV would like to clar­ify that it is not the com­mer­cial arm of Felda,” it said on Satur­day. The AP re­port doc­u­mented labour prac­tices in oil palm plan­ta­tions linked to Felda.</p>
    <p>Felda owns 34 per cent of FGV’s shares, but FGV stressed that its op­er­a­tions are “unique and in­de­pen­dent”.</p>
