    <p>New reg­u­la­tions will make cer­tain there is “no un­due bur­den” on com­mer­cial land­lords when they pass on oblig­a­tory prop­erty tax re­bates to ten­ants, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance Lawrence Wong said in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­vi­sions passed un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act yes­ter­day en­sure that the rent waivers which land­lords grant to ten­ants un­der the rental re­lief frame­work are also con­sid­ered part of their obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Il­lus­trat­ing how the amend­ments will ben­e­fit land­lords, Mr Wong cited an ex­am­ple of a change in ten­ants halfway through the year, with one ter­mi­nat­ing the oc­cu­pancy in July and another tak­ing up the space from Au­gust.</p>
    <p>If the first ten­ant is a small and medium-sized en­ter­prise (SME), the prop­erty owner would have to waive up to four months of rent from April to July un­der the rental re­lief frame­work.</p>
    <p>The owner should have then also fully sat­is­fied his obli­ga­tion to pass on the ben­e­fit of the prop­erty tax re­bate of about 1.2 months of rent, as well as some of the cash grant, Mr Wong noted.</p>
    <p>But un­der the ex­ist­ing prop­erty tax re­bate reg­u­la­tions, the land­lord would also be re­quired to pass on the ben­e­fit of the prop­erty tax re­bate to the sec­ond ten­ant, pro-rated to about 0.5 month, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>“This is not the in­tended out­come. This is be­cause the owner had al­ready waived four months of rent for Ten­ant A un­der the rental re­lief frame­work and passed on the ben­e­fit of the prop­erty tax re­bate to Ten­ant A. So, the owner should not need to pass on any ben­e­fit of the prop­erty tax re­bate to Ten­ant B.</p>
    <p>“That is why the Bill pro­vides reg­u­la­tions to be made ret­ro­spec­tively, to en­sure that this po­si­tion is main­tained,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>The Bill also al­lows reg­u­la­tions to be made to al­low the owner to re­cover the ex­cess amount from the sec­ond ten­ant if he has al­ready passed on the ben­e­fit of the</p>
    <p>prop­erty tax re­bate, he added.</p>
    <p>Details of the reg­u­la­tions will be pro­vided through sub­sidiary leg­is­la­tion and on the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s web­site when ready, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty tax re­bate was an­nounced as part of Bud­get mea­sures in Fe­bru­ary and en­hanced in March. It grants own­ers of non-res­i­den­tial prop­erty be­tween 30 per cent and 100 per cent of the re­bate on prop­erty tax payable from Jan 1 to Dec 31 this year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the rental re­lief frame­work which came into force on July 31, cash grants are also given to qual­i­fy­ing prop­erty own­ers, who are re­quired to pro­vide rental re­lief to el­i­gi­ble SME and non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion ten­ants for the pe­riod from April to at most July, de­pend­ing on the type of prop­erty.</p>
    <p>WHY RE­LIEF PE­RIOD CAN­NOT BE PRO­LONGED</p>
    <p>We will risk sus­tain­ing busi­nesses that are no longer vi­able. It would trap and lock away pre­cious eco­nomic ca­pac­i­ties such as work­ers, or prop­erty and as­sets, and this, in the longer term, would be dam­ag­ing for our economy.</p>
