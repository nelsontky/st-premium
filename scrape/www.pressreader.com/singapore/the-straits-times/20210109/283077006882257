    <p>My­olie Wu is preg­nant with her third child, but her hus­band would like to keep the gen­der un­der wraps for now.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong ac­tress, who has two sons – Brendan, three, and Ryan, 11/ – with busi­ness­man</p>
    <p>2 hus­band Philip Lee, an­nounced on Christ­mas Day that she is preg­nant.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Mr Lee posted on so­cial me­dia a photo (above) of their fam­ily of four in red Christ­mas sweaters, with him and Wu hold­ing a red baby out­fit.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Re­united. And this time we are five.... What do you think? Girl or boy?”</p>
    <p>Wu, 41, had re­turned from</p>
    <p>China last month af­ter tak­ing part in act­ing re­al­ity se­ries Ev­ery­body Stand By 2, in which she emerged the win­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee’s post sparked guesses from celebri­ties and fans, with ac­tress Linda Chung guess­ing that Wu is car­ry­ing twins.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral fans guessed that it would be a girl as they said the baby out­fit looked like a dress.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee saw the com­ments and edited his post: “The top is a uni­sex one­sie. It’s sup­posed to be dif­fer­ent from big brothers’ tops.”</p>
    <p>Wu, who is known for roles in TVB dra­mas such as Tri­umph In The Skies (2003), Wars Of In-Laws (2005) and To Grow With Love (2006), has not com­mented on her hus­band’s post.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she told the Hong Kong me­dia while film­ing an ad­ver­tise­ment last week that she is six months preg­nant.</p>
    <p>She did not dis­close the gen­der of the baby, but said her hus­band hoped that it would be a girl.</p>
