    <p>These days, many cof­fee shops have in­stalled net­ting to pre­vent pi­geons from fly­ing in.</p>
    <p>But in hawker cen­tres here, the sit­u­a­tion seems to be wors­en­ing. Pi­geons swoop in and out, some­times at a low height close to pa­trons’ heads.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency needs to do more to tackle the is­sue be­yond telling cus­tomers to re­turn their trays af­ter eat­ing.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the in­stal­la­tion of net­ting should be re­quired. Eat­ing at Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre is now more com­fort­able, safe and peace­ful af­ter net­ting was put in place.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing has al­ready re­duced the num­ber of seats at hawker cen­tres, and this is made worse by birds leav­ing their drop­pings on seats.</p>
    <p>It’s com­mon to see peo­ple eat­ing their meals at one ta­ble, while pi­geons eat left­overs nearby, which is not a good im­age to send to Sin­ga­pore­ans and tourists about hy­giene.</p>
    <p>I have been told by hawk­ers where to stand when queue­ing for food, be­cause pre­vi­ous cus­tomers had been hit by drop­pings from the birds above.</p>
    <p>On another oc­ca­sion, my hus­band and I were eat­ing dessert when bird drop­pings landed on the mid­dle of the ta­ble, af­ter which we quickly left. These days, when we choose a ta­ble, we look up to save our­selves from an un­pleas­ant dining ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>I can imag­ine a sit­u­a­tion in which a per­son buys a drink, leaves it on the ta­ble as he goes to buy his food, only for it to be con­tam­i­nated by a bird in that time.</p>
    <p>Hawker cen­tres all over Sin­ga­pore have this prob­lem. There needs to be a long-term plan to deal with it. Mary Chan Pheck Li</p>
