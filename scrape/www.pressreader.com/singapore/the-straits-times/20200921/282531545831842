    <p>English ac­tor Tom Hol­lan­der thinks his new BBC drama se­ries will make au­di­ences nos­tal­gic for a world be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In the drama Us, the 53-year-old-plays a man who goes on a sum­mer va­ca­tion around Europe with his wife Con­nie (Saskia Reeves) and son Al­bie (Tom Tay­lor) af­ter Con­nie tells him she wants a di­vorce.</p>
    <p>He says in a Zoom call with The Straits Times: “I hope au­di­ences en­joy the drama and get to ex­pe­ri­ence vi­car­i­ously the sum­mer va­ca­tion they might have planned for them­selves. Peo­ple may feel nos­tal­gic for the way most of us lived un­til Fe­bru­ary, which now feels like a by­gone age.</p>
    <p>“We filmed it only a year ago, but what a priv­i­lege it was to shoot on lo­ca­tion and how we took it for granted at the time.”</p>
    <p>The se­ries is based on writer David Ni­cholls’ book of the same name.</p>
    <p>Hol­lan­der, known for his work on tele­vi­sion such as spy-themed se­ries The Night Man­ager (2016) and films like the hor­ror thriller Bird Box (2018), was a big fan of Ni­cholls’ 2009 novel One Day.</p>
    <p>“I’m a slow reader, but One Day was one of those books I read quite quickly,” he says.</p>
    <p>Hol­lan­der was equally hooked when he read the script for Us, as well as its source ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>On the dif­fer­ences be­tween the book and the se­ries, he says: “There is more of Con­nie in the tele­vi­sion adap­ta­tion be­cause the book is very much in­side Dou­glas’ head, us­ing his nar­ra­tive voice, so we tried to make sure au­di­ences can see her point of view too.”</p>
    <p>Hol­lan­der ad­mits that his char­ac­ter Dou­glas, an or­gan­ised, up­tight man, is “not a par­tic­u­larly cool chap”.</p>
    <p>He quips: “I spend much more of my life (com­pared to Dou­glas) try­ing to be cool with vary­ing de­grees of success. It’s not some­thing I would en­cour­age in any­one.”</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the se­ries as a “re­verse rom-com” – where peo­ple who love each other try and split up – he says the di­vorce story will of­fer laughs de­spite its topic.</p>
    <p>“It’s about peo­ple try­ing to avoid the worst thing that can hap­pen. It’s a com­edy of dis­com­fort. Twothirds of the fam­ily want to es­cape and one-third is des­per­ately try­ing to hold them to­gether,” he says.</p>
    <p>“That dis­com­fort should be fa­mil­iar to peo­ple, es­pe­cially now that fam­i­lies have to stay with one an­other and there’s no es­cape.”</p>
    <p>Hol­lan­der was him­self di­ag­nosed with Covid-19. He re­vealed his di­ag­no­sis in a per­sonal es­say pub­lished in Sel­wyn, the mag­a­zine of his alma mater Sel­wyn Col­lege, Uni­ver­sity of Cam­bridge. The piece was later re­pub­lished in the mag­a­zine New States­man in June.</p>
    <p>He says that, to the best of his knowl­edge, he has fully re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Asked if it was dif­fi­cult not work­ing as an ac­tor as the pan­demic has shut much of the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try, the bach­e­lor says: “No, it was not dif­fi­cult be­cause no­body was work­ing then. I didn’t lose a mem­ber of my fam­ily, I didn’t have to home­school my chil­dren. I didn’t have a cat­a­strophic loss of in­come so I was ex­tremely lucky in my ex­pe­ri­ence of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>He is in­stead more con­cerned with the plight of theatre prac­ti­tion­ers and staff. The­atres in the United King­dom were hit hard by the pan­demic as they were or­dered to shut for months and many are on the brink of clos­ing.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest ca­su­alty in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try here is def­i­nitely theatre. There may be a young gen­er­a­tion of peo­ple who do not get to work and prac­tise their trade and craft in this most cru­cial time of de­vel­op­ing them­selves,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Us pre­mieres today at 8am on BBC First (StarHub TV Chan­nel 502) and BBC Player.</p>
