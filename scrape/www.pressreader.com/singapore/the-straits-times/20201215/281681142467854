    <p>Un­like the mi­grant worker pop­u­la­tion – where al­most 50 per cent of those stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 – the preva­lence rate of the virus in the larger com­mu­nity is much smaller, the Health Min­istry’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said yesterday.</p>
    <p>This lower rate, based on a serol­ogy sam­pling study con­ducted in the com­mu­nity be­tween Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber, re­flects peo­ple’s ad­her­ence to Covid-19 safety mea­sures, he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak said the study found that only four out of 1,600 sub­jects had a pos­i­tive serol­ogy test, which trans­lates to a pos­si­ble com­mu­nity preva­lence rate of 0.25 per cent.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, about 47 per cent of the 323,000 mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dorms have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 as at Sun­day, based on poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) and serol­ogy tests.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak gave the fig­ures at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence when asked whether there is a group of Sin­ga­pore­ans who do not need the vaccine jab be­cause they may have an­ti­bod­ies from a past in­fec­tion to shield against re­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Those with a pos­i­tive serol­ogy test would have been in­fected in the past, at least 10 to 14 days back, while those with a pos­i­tive PCR test are highly likely to be cur­rently in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But, at the same time, the serol­ogy re­sults in the com­mu­nity do in­di­cate a higher preva­lence rate of Covid-19 in­fec­tion com­pared with the preva­lence rate de­rived from pos­i­tive PCR re­sults, Prof Mak said.</p>
    <p>The preva­lence of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity, based on pos­i­tive PCR re­sults, was around 0.04 per cent, much lower than the 0.25 per cent rate found in the com­mu­nity sam­pling study.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, fewer dorm res­i­dents tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 with the PCR test­ing than the serol­ogy test­ing. There were 54,505 who tested pos­i­tive with PCR tests, com­pared with 98,289 who were pos­i­tive with serol­ogy tests, although they did not have a pos­i­tive PCR test.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said: “This is in keep­ing with our un­der­stand­ing that Covid-19 in­fec­tion can oc­cur in an asymp­to­matic fash­ion among peo­ple. This is also the rea­son why we need to con­tinue our vig­i­lance and not as­sume there is no cryp­tic spread of Covid-19 in­fec­tion in the com­mu­nity.”</p>
