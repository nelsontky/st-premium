    <p>TOKYO • One of Ja­panese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s fi­nal tasks in of­fice will be to de­cide whether to ac­quire weapons that al­low pre­emp­tive strike ca­pa­bil­ity against en­emy mis­sile bases in other coun­tries, lo­cal media has re­ported, cit­ing gov­ern­ment sources.</p>
    <p>But this would be diplo­mat­i­cally con­tro­ver­sial given Ja­pan’s war­time his­tory. Some do­mes­tic and for­eign pol­icy ex­perts have also ar­gued that it is a slip­pery slope to­wards ag­gres­sion and mil­i­tarism.</p>
    <p>The idea of Ja­pan hav­ing “the abil­ity to in­ter­cept bal­lis­tic missiles and oth­ers, even in the ter­ri­tory of an en­emy” comes de­spite its strictly de­fence-ori­ented pol­icy and paci­fist Con­sti­tu­tion, which Mr Abe was forced to aban­don his dreams of amend­ing. A de­ci­sion on the weapons to buy is due by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, who abruptly re­signed last Fri­day but is stay­ing on un­til a suc­ces­sor is cho­sen, will likely map out a new se­cu­rity pol­icy at a Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil meet­ing to be held by next week.</p>
    <p>This is be­fore the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party votes for its new pres­i­dent on Sept 14, and be­fore Par­lia­ment is set to con­vene two days later to of­fi­cially in­au­gu­rate the new prime minister.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe will also over­see talks on an al­ter­na­tive plan for the United States’ land-based Aegis Ashore anti-bal­lis­tic mis­sile sys­tem, which Ja­pan ditched in June af­ter it found that a costly tech­ni­cal re­design was necessary to en­sure that boost­ers would not fall on res­i­den­tial ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The Aegis Ashore sys­tem had been meant to beef up Ja­pan’s mis­sile de­fences against ex­ter­nal threats, pri­mar­ily North Korea.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tive plans be­ing con­sid­ered in­clude us­ing float­ing is­lands with mis­sile de­fence sys­tems, drones to mon­i­tor mis­sile sites as well as ex­pand­ing Ja­pan’s fleet of Aegis war­ships and squadron of air­borne early-warn­ing air­craft.</p>
