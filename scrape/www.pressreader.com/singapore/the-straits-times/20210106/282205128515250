    <p>In­done­sia’s ride-hail­ing and pay­ments gi­ant Go­jek is in ad­vanced dis­cus­sions over merg­ing with lo­cal e-com­merce pi­o­neer Toko­pe­dia, ahead of a planned ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) of the com­bined en­tity, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s two most valu­able start-ups have signed a de­tailed term sheet to con­duct due dili­gence of each other’s busi­ness, said the peo­ple, who asked not to be named. Both sides see po­ten­tial syn­er­gies and are keen to close the deal as soon as pos­si­ble, they said.</p>
    <p>The merged en­tity would cre­ate an In­done­sian In­ter­net pow­er­house with a com­bined val­u­a­tion of more than US$18 billion (S$23.7 billion). Its busi­nesses range from ride-hail­ing and pay­ments to on­line shop­ping and de­liv­ery – a lo­cal mash-up of Uber Tech­nolo­gies, PayPal Hold­ings, Ama­zon.com, and Do­or­Dash. It plans to go pub­lic in the United States and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“This is po­ten­tially a block­buster deal,” said Mr Us­man Akhtar, a part­ner at Bain & Co in Sin­ga­pore. “The deal would have a lot of im­pact out­side of these two com­pa­nies and have rip­ple ef­fects that aren’t all known right now.”</p>
    <p>Go­jek and Toko­pe­dia have been con­sid­er­ing a po­ten­tial merger since 2018, but dis­cus­sions ac­cel­er­ated af­ter deal talks be­tween Go­jek and arch-ri­val Grab Hold­ings reached an im­passe, the peo­ple said. Grab chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer An­thony Tan con­tin­ues to re­sist pres­sure from SoftBank Group’s Masayoshi Son to give up some con­trol in a com­bined en­tity with Go­jek, said the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s two most valu­able start-ups – to­gether worth about US$25 billion – held on-and­off talks to com­bine af­ter years of fierce com­pe­ti­tion in ride-hail­ing, food de­liv­ery and fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy. As re­cently as last De­cem­ber, the two com­pa­nies were said to have made sub­stan­tial progress in work­ing out a deal to com­bine, peo­ple with knowl­edge of the talks told Bloomberg News at the time. But they clashed over how to man­age In­done­sia, the key mar­ket in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Son, who had been a stead­fast sup­porter of Mr Tan in the past, is los­ing pa­tience with the Grab co-founder’s re­luc­tance to cede some con­trol and is now sup­port­ing a merger be­tween Go­jek and SoftBank-backed Toko­pe­dia, the peo­ple said. The two home­grown tech pi­o­neers have com­mon in­vestors, in­clud­ing Google, Te­masek Hold­ings and Se­quoia Cap­i­tal In­dia.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives of Go­jek and Toko­pe­dia de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The firms are val­ued at about US$10.5 billion and about US$7.5 billion, re­spec­tively, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with their ac­counts, and merger ra­tios are cur­rently un­der dis­cus­sion. The founders of the two com­pa­nies have been friends since their in­cep</p>
    <p>tion more than 10 years ago and an­tic­i­pate an am­i­ca­ble al­liance. Grab and Go­jek’s dis­cus­sions were more con­tentious and had not pro­gressed enough for them to sign a term sheet, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>A com­bined Go­jek and Toko­pe­dia would dom­i­nate in In­done­sia, one of the world’s fastest-grow­ing In­ter­net economies. Their planned US list­ing would pro­vide global in­vestors with an al­ter­na­tive to Sea Ltd, the only ma­jor South-east Asian In­ter­net com­pany listed in the US. Sea’s shares climbed al­most 400 per cent last year, boosted by the grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of its mo­bile gam­ing and on­line shop­ping plat­form.</p>
    <p>A deal be­tween Go­jek and Toko­pe­dia is likely to face less reg­u­la­tory op­po­si­tion than the deal pre­vi­ously un­der con­sid­er­a­tion. The com­bi­na­tion of Grab and Go­jek</p>
    <p>would re­duce com­pe­ti­tion in ride­hail­ing, de­liv­ery and dig­i­tal pay­ments i n South-east Asia, a prospect over which gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials have al­ready ex­pressed reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies are con­tem­plat­ing sev­eral op­tions for an IPO. They could choose a tra­di­tional IPO in In­done­sia and the US or work with a blank-cheque com­pany for the US list­ing, one of the peo­ple said. A hand­ful of blankchequ­e com­pa­nies have held dis­cus­sions with the two com­pa­nies in re­cent months, the per­son said.</p>
    <p>“South-east Asia’s uni­corns are en­ter­ing a stage of ma­tu­rity where in­vestors re­quire an exit, such as a trade sale or IPO,” said Mr Mark Robin­son, Asia-Pa­cific head of tech­nol­ogy, media and tele­com at in­ter­na­tional l aw firm Her­bert Smith Free­hills. “It is driv­ing com</p>
    <p>pa­nies to look at a host of op­tions, some novel and chal­leng­ing.”</p>
    <p>Toko­pe­dia last month said it had hired Mor­gan Stan­ley and Cit­i­group as ad­vis­ers to help ac­cel­er­ate its plan to go pub­lic, fol­low­ing a Bloomberg News re­port that Bridgetown Hold­ings, the blankchequ­e com­pany backed by bil­lion­aires Richard Li and Peter Thiel, is con­sid­er­ing a po­ten­tial merger with the e-com­merce gi­ant. The spe­cial pur­pose ac­qui­si­tion com­pany (Spac) is ex­plor­ing the struc­ture and fea­si­bil­ity of a deal with Toko­pe­dia.</p>
    <p>“We have not de­cided yet which mar­ket and method, and are still con­sid­er­ing op­tions,” Toko­pe­dia said in a state­ment on Dec 16. “Spac is a po­ten­tial op­tion that we could con­sider but we have not com­mit­ted to any­thing at the mo­ment.”</p>
