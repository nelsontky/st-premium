    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US Jus­tice De­part­ment said yes­ter­day that it has charged five Chi­nese res­i­dents and two Malaysian busi­ness­men over a wide-rang­ing hack­ing ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors said five Chi­nese na­tion­als had been charged with hack­ing more than 100 com­pa­nies i n the United States and abroad, in­clud­ing soft­ware devel­op­ment com­pa­nies, com­puter man­u­fac­tur­ers, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions providers, so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies, video game com­pa­nies, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions, uni­ver­si­ties and think-tanks, as well as for­eign gov­ern­ments and pro-democ­racy politi­cians and ac­tivists in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks “fa­cil­i­tated the theft of source code, soft­ware code sign­ing cer­tifi­cates, cus­tomer ac­count data and valu­able busi­ness in­for­ma­tion”, the de­part­ment said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment also said two Malaysian busi­ness­men, Wong Ong Hua, 46, and Ling Yang Ching, 32, were charged with conspiring with two of the Chi­nese hack­ers to profit from com­puter in­tru­sions tar­get­ing video game com­pa­nies in the US, France, Ja­pan, Sin­ga­pore and South Korea.</p>
    <p>The Jus­tice De­part­ment said the pair op­er­ated through a Malaysian firm called SEA Gamer Mall.</p>
    <p>De­part­ment of­fi­cials cred­ited the Malaysian au­thor­i­ties with ar­rest­ing the two busi­ness­men.</p>
    <p>But Deputy At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Jef­frey Rosen said “the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party has cho­sen a dif­fer­ent path of mak­ing China safe for cy­ber crim­i­nals so long as they at­tack com­put­ers out­side China and steal in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty help­ful to China”.</p>
    <p>The Jus­tice De­part­ment said it has ob­tained search war­rants this month re­sult­ing in the seizure of hun­dreds of ac­counts, servers, do­main names and “dead drop” Web pages used by the hack­ers to help siphon data from their vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the US has black­listed a Chi­nese de­vel­oper of a port, air­port and re­sort com­plex in Cam­bo­dia, say­ing it was built on land seized from lo­cal peo­ple and there were “cred­i­ble re­ports” it could be used to host Chi­nese mil­i­tary as­sets.</p>
    <p>Union Devel­op­ment Group Co is build­ing the Dara Sakor com­plex in a na­tional park on the Cam­bo­dian coast, with a run­way ca­pa­ble of tak­ing some of the world’s big­gest planes.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said there were “cred­i­ble re­ports” that Dara Sakor “could be used to host (Chi­nese) mil­i­tary as­sets”.</p>
    <p>“If so, (this) would go against Cam­bo­dia’s Con­sti­tu­tion and could threaten Indo-Pa­cific sta­bil­ity, pos­si­bly im­pact­ing Cam­bo­dia’s sovereignt­y and the se­cu­rity of our al­lies,” he added in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
