    <p>WASHINGTON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Tues­day called off talks on a new stim­u­lus plan un­til af­ter the elec­tion, ac­cus­ing Democrats of not ne­go­ti­at­ing in good faith.</p>
    <p>“I have in­structed my rep­re­sen­ta­tives to stop ne­go­ti­at­ing un­til af­ter the elec­tion,” he wrote in a tweet.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion sent Wall Street stocks plung­ing and up­ended re­cent progress made in the longstalle­d talks af­ter Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi restarted ne­go­ti­a­tions last week.</p>
    <p>The two sides were try­ing to reach an agree­ment on the size of the new stim­u­lus pack­age fol­low­ing the ex­pi­ra­tion of parts of the US$2.2 tril­lion (S$3 tril­lion) Cares Act passed as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets that had been hold­ing steady all day plunged into the red af­ter Mr Trump’s tweet.</p>
    <p>Cetera Fi­nan­cial Group chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Gene Gold­man said: “Over the past few trad­ing ses­sions, the mar­ket had ral­lied around stim­u­lus talks and now it’s al­most a slap in the face.”</p>
    <p>The Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age shed 1.3 per cent to close at 27,772.76 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Oil prices tum­bled af­ter Mr Trump’s an­nounce­ment, with in­vestors wor­ried about the im­pact on Amer­i­cans’ de­mand, while data show­ing a jump in US stock­piles added to the con­cerns. Asian mar­kets fluc­tu­ated yes­ter­day, be­fore mount­ing a late re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi’s most re­cent pro­posal</p>
    <p>would cost US$2.2 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Trump in his tweet cited the in­cor­rect fig­ure of US$2.4 tril­lion for the Bill and ac­cused her of want­ing “to bail out poorly run, high-crime Demo­crat states, money that is in no way re­lated to Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>“We made a very gen­er­ous of­fer of US$1.6 tril­lion and, as usual, she is not ne­go­ti­at­ing in good faith,” he said.</p>
    <p>He said he told Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell to fo­cus the Repub­li­can-con­trolled cham­ber on con­firm­ing Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett to the Supreme Court seat va­cated last month by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, which would give con­ser­va­tives a solid sixto-three ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment to tor­pedo any chance of new aid un­til af­ter the elec­tion came just hours af­ter Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Jerome Pow­ell said the US econ­omy would re­cover “stronger and faster” with more gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus to help work­ers and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“Too lit­tle sup­port would lead to a weak re­cov­ery, cre­at­ing un­nec­es­sary hard­ship for house­holds and busi­nesses,” Mr Pow­ell said in an ad­dress at an eco­nomics con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump later urged law­mak­ers to agree on hand­outs for strug­gling Amer­i­cans and help for small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>He tweeted that he would im­me­di­ately sign a con­gres­sional Bill guar­an­tee­ing a sec­ond round of US$1,200 hand­outs and US$135 bil­lion for small busi­nesses – which were al­ready in­cluded in the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent also urged law­mak­ers to ap­prove US$25 bil­lion to sup­port the founder­ing avi­a­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“So there is still some stim­u­lus per­haps com­ing be­fore the elec­tion,” said Mr Ben Emons, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Med­ley Global Ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>Wall Street fu­tures re­bounded af­ter the lat­est tweets.</p>
    <p>With pres­i­den­tial chal­lenger Joe Bi­den well ahead in na­tional and bat­tle­ground polling, mar­kets have been pric­ing in the like­li­hood he will take the White House, with Democrats pos­si­bly win­ning both houses of Congress.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said such a sce­nario could see a much big­ger stim­u­lus passed, al­beit not un­til af­ter Jan­uary’s in­au­gu­ra­tion.</p>
