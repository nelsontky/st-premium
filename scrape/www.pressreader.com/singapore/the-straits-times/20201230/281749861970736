    <p>The scale of the Covid-19 out­break in Wuhan early this year may have been nearly 10 times the recorded tally, a study con­ducted by China’s pub­lic health author­i­ties in­di­cates, leav­ing the city where the coro­n­avirus first took hold still well short of the im­mu­nity re­quired to pro­tect against a po­ten­tial resur­gence.</p>
    <p>About 4.4 per cent of those tested were found to have spe­cific an­ti­bod­ies that can fight off the coro­n­avirus, in­di­cat­ing they were in­fected some time in the past, ac­cord­ing to a sero­log­i­cal sur­vey of more than 34,000 peo­ple done in April by the Chi­nese Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion. The data was re­leased late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>That ra­tio would sug­gest that with Wuhan home to about 11 mil­lion peo­ple, as many as 500,000 res­i­dents may have been in­fected, nearly 10 times the 50,000 con­firmed Covid-19 cases re­ported by the health author­i­ties in mid-April, when the sur­vey was con­ducted.</p>
    <p>China has been crit­i­cised in­ter­na­tion­ally for its ini­tial han­dling of the out­break, which has spread around the world in the year since the first cases emerged.</p>
    <p>The US has raised ques­tions about China’s ac­count­ing of the virus fall­out in Wuhan, cap­i­tal of</p>
    <p>Hubei prov­ince, which was quickly eclipsed by larger out­breaks in Europe and North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of re­vi­sions of the case and deaths data added to sus­pi­cions that China was mas­sag­ing the num­bers.</p>
    <p>While the sero­log­i­cal data may reignite those claims, it is com­mon for the health author­i­ties to un­der­re­port cases dur­ing an acute out­break, given that test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties can be limited and hos­pi­tals over­whelmed with a sud­den surge in pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus’ abil­ity to qui­etly in­fect peo­ple with­out mak­ing some of them sick un­til later or even through­out the in­fec­tion pe­riod only ex­ac­er­bates the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Sero­log­i­cal sur­veil­lance has been widely used by health pro­fes­sion­als around the world to gauge the true scale of epi­demics, from Aids and hep­ati­tis to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The preva­lence of dis­ease de­rived from such stud­ies can guide mit­i­ga­tion and vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey showed far less im­pact of the virus out­side Wuhan, which was ef­fec­tively shut off early this year as a way of con­tain­ing the out­break.</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive rate for an­ti­bod­ies dropped to 0.44 per cent for the broader Hubei prov­ince, which was also placed un­der a three­month lock­down.</p>
    <p>Only two peo­ple tested pos­i­tive for the an­ti­body among the 12,000 sur­veyed in six other Chi­nese cities and prov­inces, in­clud­ing Bei­jing, Shang­hai and Guang­dong, sug­gest­ing an ex­tremely low preva­lence of the virus across the rest of the coun­try.</p>
