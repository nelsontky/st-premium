    <p>SEOUL • It has been a month since South Korean K-pop girl group Blackpink’s Rose (left) de­buted as the face of Yves Saint Lau­rent’s new global cam­paign, and her star power is al­ready shin­ing bright on the Parisian fash­ion house, re­ports South Korean pop cul­ture web­site, Kore­aboo.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to shop­ping data from iPrice Group, an on­line shop­ping ag­gre­ga­tor based in Malaysia, in­ter­est in YSL prod­ucts has sky­rock­eted in mul­ti­ple coun­tries, with some coun­tries see­ing as­tound­ing upticks of more than 1,000 per cent.</p>
    <p>The French fash­ion house re­vealed its first video with Rose on June 29 and, since then, she has been seen on YSL bill­boards across the world, from Hong Kong to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Rose, who has ap­peared in mul­ti­ple clips show­ing off the brand’s Fall 2020 col­lec­tion, seems to be gen­er­at­ing much buzz, es­pe­cially on the in­ter­webs of South-east Asia and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Data from iPrice Group shows that searches for the brand in­creased ex­po­nen­tially on e-com­merce sites in the Philip­pines, Thai­land, Viet­nam, In­done­sia, Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, all within two weeks after Rose de­buted as am­bas­sador.</p>
    <p>Searches across all Yves Saint Lau­rent prod­ucts have in­creased by 13 per cent on av­er­age in these coun­tries too.</p>
    <p>Rose, who is fol­low­ing in the foot­steps of other famed muses in­clud­ing model Cara Delev­ingne and ac­tress Zoe Kravitz, is not shy about her love for the brand. Ac­cord­ing to Vogue, she has at­tended two of its Paris Fash­ion Week shows and fre­quently totes its tro­phy hand­bags on her trav­els, most re­cently, the brand’s Solferino bag.</p>
    <p>So it is no sur­prise that the prod­uct du jour is the fash­ion house’s bags. On av­er­age, her megawatt star power has led to a 343 per cent jump in in­ter­est in YSL hand­bags, with some coun­tries, in­clud­ing In­done­sia, see­ing a stag­ger­ing 1,168 per cent in­crease in in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Her band­mates have also ex­pe­ri­enced sim­i­lar suc­cess as brand am­bas­sadors. Jen­nie is one for Chanel, while Lisa and Jisoo have been lend­ing their star wattage to Ce­line and Dior re­spec­tively.</p>
