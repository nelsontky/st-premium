    <p>Civil un­rest around the world in the past two years has pro­vided two im­por­tant lessons for Sin­ga­pore in pub­lic or­der and trust, said Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the Hong Kong protests that have lasted since March last year, Mr Shan­mugam said they demon­strated the im­por­tance of ex­er­cis­ing the free­dom of as­sem­bly re­spon­si­bly. While the protests ini­tially started as an ob­jec­tion against a pro­posed ex­tra­di­tion Bill, they later spi­ralled into a broader is­sue of “peo­ple ver­sus the po­lice”, said Mr Shan­mugam, who was speak­ing dur­ing a vir­tual Home Team Na­tional Day Ob­ser­vance Cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Apart from the so­cial and eco­nomic rea­sons for the long­stand­ing protests, he said it was his view that al­low­ing protests by de­fault, with po­lice in­ter­ven­ing only when vi­o­lence oc­curred, cre­ated an “im­pos­si­ble sit­u­a­tion” for the po­lice, which was known as one of the finest in Asia.</p>
    <p>“You have a large group of peace­ful protesters – easy for a small group of in­sti­ga­tors to in­fil­trate these mass or peace­ful protests and or­ches­trate vi­o­lence... and that puts the po­lice in a very, very dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion in the fi­nan­cial hub was also wors­ened by bi­ased me­dia re­port­ing from for­eign and lo­cal me­dia, which gen­er­ally left out vi­o­lent acts against the po­lice and in­stead, fo­cused on po­lice re­sponses, caus­ing pub­lic sen­ti­ment to turn against the po­lice, he said. In com­par­i­son, in Sin­ga­pore, protests may be held only at Speak­ers’ Cor­ner in Hong Lim Park. This has al­lowed Sin­ga­pore to pre­serve pub­lic or­der on the streets and avoid dis­rupt­ing peo­ple’s lives, while still al­low­ing ex­pres­sion of views in pub­lic, he said.</p>
    <p>The se­cond les­son for Sin­ga­pore, said Mr Shan­mugam, is the im­por­tance of trust, which is hard-earned and pre­cious for any law en­force­ment agency. “Trust is built up when peo­ple see that the sys­tem is fair and it works for them – the so­cial eco­nomic sys­tem,” he added. “If peo­ple don’t have trust in the en­tire sys­tem, then no amount of po­lice en­force­ment ac­tion can bring or­der to a so­ci­ety. Be­cause the pub­lic have lost trust in the en­tire sys­tem, so why should they fol­low the rules?”</p>
    <p>This can be seen in the United States, where the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment is a wider man­i­fes­ta­tion of dis­trust of the po­lice, af­ter years of “per­ceived in­sti­tu­tion­alised racism and bru­tal­ity”, said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, how­ever, the sit­u­a­tion is dif­fer­ent, with 90 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­press­ing trust in the po­lice in pub­lic per­cep­tion sur­veys.</p>
    <p>Other Home Team agen­cies, in­clud­ing the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force, Sin­ga­pore Pri­son Ser­vice and Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau, also have “very high lev­els of trust” that have been earned over the years, he said.</p>
    <p>But trust is eas­ily lost, and main­tain­ing it starts from the po­lit­i­cal level and down the line, to ev­ery Home Team of­fi­cer, he added.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Shan­mugam also ac­knowl­edged the Home Team’s front-line ef­forts in the Gov­ern­ment’s Covid-19 re­sponse, on top of their day-to-day re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony recog­nised 168 Home Team of­fi­cers, vol­un­teers, or­gan­i­sa­tions, team projects and op­er­a­tions, as well as mem­bers of the pub­lic for their con­tri­bu­tions over the past year.</p>
