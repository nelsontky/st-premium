    <p>Stu­dents and par­ents alike are di­vided about this year’s national ex­am­i­na­tions tak­ing place, given the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board yes­ter­day an­nounced that Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures will con­tinue to be im­ple­mented in schools and ex­am­i­na­tion venues where national ex­ams are con­ducted.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates who test pos­i­tive for Covid-19, or are placed on quar­an­tine or­ders or stay-home no­tices (SHN) will not be al­lowed to sit the ex­ams to avoid in­fect­ing other stu­dents.</p>
    <p>While some feel as­sured by safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures that are put in place, oth­ers are scep­ti­cal about the as­sess­ment cri­te­ria for special con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Civil ser­vant Jas­mine Khoo, 45, feels as­sured that her daugh­ter’s school will have good safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place when she takes her PSLE ex­ams in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>“I think what is more im­por­tant is to en­sure that my daugh­ter stays healthy, so I will be giv­ing her more fruit and veg­eta­bles to boost her im­mu­nity. But in terms of hav­ing the ex­ams con­tinue as per nor­mal, I am not wor­ried as the stu­dents are seated sep­a­rately with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures,” she said.</p>
    <p>House­wife Diane Wee, 45, said her 12-year-old daugh­ter, who has at­ten­tion deficit hyper­ac­tiv­ity dis­or­der, has ex­ist­ing special ar­range­ments with her school to take her ex­ams in a sep­a­rate class­room as she re­quires ex­tra time for her pa­pers.</p>
    <p>All pupils who are un­der the same ar­range­ment will be seated in al­ter­nate rows and col­umns, and are tasked to wipe down their desks and chairs be­fore be­gin­ning the paper, said Mrs Wee.</p>
    <p>“I think that suf­fi­cient care has been taken to en­sure the safety of the stu­dents tak­ing the ex­ams, and I am com­fort­able al­low­ing her to con­tinue with it,” she added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, should her child be un­able to take the ex­ams and has to opt for special con­sid­er­a­tion, Mrs Wee is con­cerned about the bench­mark by which the grades are de­rived. “For ex­am­ple, if the bench­mark is taken based on her school pre­lim­i­nary ex­ams which might be slightly more dif­fi­cult than some other schools, then her grades would be lower than the national av­er­age and would end up af­fect­ing her fi­nal PSLE score,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Khoo also felt that all pupils, in­clud­ing those on SHN, should be given a chance to take their PSLE ex­ams, pro­vided that they are phys­i­cally well. For in­stance, she sug­gested that special ar­range­ments could be made for them to take the ex­ams on­line if they wanted to.</p>
    <p>The MOE said in a state­ment that stu­dents tak­ing the ex­ams at home will re­quire on­line in­vig­i­la­tion, which may com­pro­mise the fair­ness and in­tegrity of the ex­ams.</p>
    <p>Other stu­dents like Rena Kek, 18, is also wor­ried about the prospect of hav­ing to ap­ply for special con­sid­er­a­tion should she be un­able to take her A-level ex­ams in Oc­to­ber for some of her sub­jects.</p>
    <p>“My class­mates and I are es­pe­cially jit­tery about the ex­ams as there is a fear that some­one next to you could be car­ry­ing the virus,</p>
    <p>As our pa­pers are typ­i­cally three hours long and the ex­ams last over a cou­ple of weeks, I am still try­ing to ad­just to the mea­sures in place, like wear­ing a mask through­out the paper, which gets a bit un­com­fort­able at times.</p>
    <p>STILL TRY­ING TO AD­JUST</p>
    <p>with so many of us seated in the same ex­am­i­na­tion hall,” she said.</p>
    <p>“As our pa­pers are typ­i­cally three hours long and the ex­ams last over a cou­ple of weeks, I am still try­ing to ad­just to the mea­sures in place, like wear­ing a mask through­out the paper, which gets a bit un­com­fort­able at times. But ul­ti­mately, I just hope that ev­ery­thing will run smoothly and there will be no dis­rup­tions.”</p>
    <p>To en­sure that she stays in the pink of health for her A lev­els, she has been min­imis­ing out­ings and en­sur­ing that she con­tin­ues to prac­tise good hy­giene.</p>
    <p>“I think the A lev­els are im­por­tant as it is our last ma­jor ex­am­i­na­tion, so be­ing able to take the exam pro­vides ev­ery­one with an equal op­por­tu­nity to do well and see our two years of hard work come to fruition. If pre­lim ex­ams are taken into con­sid­er­a­tion (for the fi­nal grade), some of us may not fare as well, but we may make huge leaps of im­prove­ments in time for the fi­nal exam,” she added.</p>
    <p>But for 16-year-old Bray­den Wu who is set to take his N-level ex­ams next month, the pos­si­bil­ity of ap­ply­ing for special con­sid­er­a­tion and be­ing graded on other cri­te­ria is much less daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>“I think putting a stu­dent through the fi­nal exam may not be an ac­tual rep­re­sen­ta­tion of his abil­i­ties. Af­ter all, we do sit through all our ex­ams, es­pe­cially our pre­lims, like they are the ac­tual ex­ams. So, I would not be so wor­ried if I were to miss my N lev­els,” he said.</p>
