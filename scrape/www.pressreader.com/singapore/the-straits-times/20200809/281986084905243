    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s mer­cu­rial and hard­en­ing at­ti­tude to­wards China, have changed Bei­jing’s cal­cu­la­tions on its in­creas­ingly touchy re­la­tion­ship with the United States.</p>
    <p>That China wants Mr Trump to lose the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber be­cause it sees him as “un­pre­dictable” – re­vealed on Fri­day in an Amer­i­can in­tel­li­gence as­sess­ment – makes sense as ten­sions grow, with fears in­creas­ing that a pre­vi­ously largely the­o­ret­i­cal clash with China over Tai­wan or in the South China Sea could be­come an ac­tual one.</p>
    <p>In­tel­li­gence agen­cies said on Fri­day that China and Iran are work­ing to sway US vot­ers against Mr Trump while Rus­sia is work­ing against Demo­cratic Party op­po­nent Joe Bi­den, his ri­val in the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>For China, un­til the pan­demic, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had been a mixed bag, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>The out­break, cou­pled with the cam­paign for elec­tion, has shifted the cal­cu­lus.</p>
    <p>Strate­gi­cally, “China has got­ten its gifts and sees di­min­ish­ing re­turns from Trump”, Dr Robert Man­ning, res­i­dent se­nior fel­low at the At­lantic Coun­cil’s Scowcroft Cen­tre for Strat­egy and Se­cu­rity, told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“I doubt they have high ex­pec­ta­tions of Joe Bi­den, but see the prospect of fash­ion­ing a frame­work for com­pet­i­tive co­ex­is­tence,” Dr Man­ning said.</p>
    <p>Just as the pan­demic trig­gered a pub­lic health and eco­nomic cri­sis that dis­rupted the elec­tion out­look for Mr Trump, it has also fun­da­men­tally changed China’s as­sess­ment of the US un­der him, said Ms Yun Sun, se­nior fel­low and di­rec­tor of the China Pro­gramme at the Stim­son Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The US-China re­la­tion­ship had, un­til the pan­demic, been framed as strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump and his ad­min­is­tra­tion, as well as the Repub­li­can Party, now ad­di­tion­ally blame the pan­demic on China – an ac­cu­sa­tion that has be­come front and cen­tre of the Pres­i­dent’s de­fence of his record in his bid for re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In the Chi­nese view, although China should carry some re­spon­si­bil­ity for the early mis­man­age­ment of the pan­demic, the United States’ sys­temic fail­ure to deal with the pan­demic af­ter March is not China’s fault, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>“For the Chi­nese, the rapid de­te­ri­o­ra­tion and un­prece­dented po­lit­i­cal clashes be­tween the US and China are by de­sign Trump’s strat­egy to di­vert Amer­i­can do­mes­tic at­ten­tion and shift blame.”</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, through Bei­jing’s lens, China has not done any­thing wrong. Its ag­gres­sive “wolf war­rior” di­plo­macy, and the ef­fect of the pan­demic in shap­ing per­cep­tions of China abroad, are not quite taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>China blames the plunge in bi­lat­eral re­la­tions on the US, tweeted Ms Bon­nie Glaser, se­nior ad­viser for Asia and di­rec­tor of the China Power Pro­ject at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“There will not be im­prove­ment in US-China re­la­tions un­til Bei­jing as­sumes some re­spon­si­bil­ity for where we are now,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>The tweet was in re­sponse to a long, de­tailed, signed ar­ti­cle in China’s state-con­trolled Global Times by Mr Yang Jiechi, a mem­ber of the Po­lit­i­cal Bureau of the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC) Cen­tral Com­mit­tee and di­rec­tor of the Of­fice of the For­eign Af­fairs Com­mis­sion of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle is ti­tled “Re­spect his­tory, look to the fu­ture and firmly safe­guard and sta­bilise China-US re­la­tions”. Its tone is con­cil­ia­tory – but firm.</p>
    <p>Now, faced with the real fear of a mil­i­tary clash with the US for the first time in four decades, what China pri­ori­tises most is the sta­bil­i­sa­tion of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions, Ms Sun told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The US also sees the is­sue through its own lens.</p>
    <p>“Although China will con­tinue to weigh the risks and ben­e­fits of ag­gres­sive ac­tion, its pub­lic rhetoric over the past few months has grown in­creas­ingly crit­i­cal of the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion’s Covid-19 re­sponse, clo­sure of China’s Hous­ton con­sulate and ac­tions on other is­sues,” Na­tional Counter-in­tel­li­gence and Se­cu­rity Cen­tre di­rec­tor Wil­liam Evan­ina said in a state­ment on for­eign threats to the 2020 US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, it has harshly crit­i­cised the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s state­ments and ac­tions on Hong Kong, TikTok, the le­gal sta­tus of the South China Sea, and China’s ef­forts to dom­i­nate the 5G mar­ket. Bei­jing recog­nises that all of these ef­forts might af­fect the pres­i­den­tial race.”</p>
    <p>China has been ex­pand­ing its in­flu­ence ef­forts ahead of Novem­ber to shape the pol­icy environmen­t in the US, pres­sure po­lit­i­cal fig­ures it views as op­posed to China’s in­ter­ests, and de­flect and counter crit­i­cism of China, Mr Evan­ina said.</p>
    <p>The con­clu­sion: “We as­sess that China prefers that Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Trump – whom Bei­jing sees as un­pre­dictable – does not win re-elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign, in a brief state­ment signed off by com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor Tim Mur­taugh, and in line with the cam­paign’s mes­sag­ing and rhetoric, shot back: “The in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity’s as­sess­ment that both China and Iran are try­ing to stop Pres­i­dent Trump’s re-elec­tion is con­cern­ing, but clearly be­cause he has held them ac­count­able af­ter years of cod­dling by politi­cians like Joe Bi­den.”</p>
    <p>Dr James Carafano, vice-pres­i­dent at The Kathryn and Shelby Cul­lom Davis In­sti­tute for Na­tional Se­cu­rity and For­eign Pol­icy at the con­ser­va­tive Her­itage Foun­da­tion, has a dif­fer­ent view. “China wants to win with­out fight­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Trump isn’t in­ter­ested in es­ca­lat­ing con­flict. This is man­age­able on both their parts,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
