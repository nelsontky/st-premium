    <p>SEOUL • North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said there will be no more war as the coun­try’s nu­clear weapons guar­an­tee its safety and fu­ture de­spite un­abated out­side pres­sure and mil­i­tary threats, state me­dia said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim made the re­marks as he cel­e­brated the 67th an­niver­sary of the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, which fell on July 27, with a re­cep­tion for vet­er­ans, the of­fi­cial KCNA news agency said.</p>
    <p>The coun­try de­vel­oped nu­clear weapons to win “ab­so­lute strength” to stave off an­other armed con­flict, he said in a speech car­ried by KCNA, em­pha­sis­ing the de­fen­sive na­ture of the pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“Now we are ca­pa­ble of de­fend­ing our­selves in the face of any form of high-in­ten­sity pres­sure and mil­i­tary threats from im­pe­ri­al­ist and hos­tile forces,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Thanks to our reliable and ef­fec­tive self-de­fen­sive nu­clear de­ter­rent, there will no longer be war, and our coun­try’s safety and fu­ture will be firmly guar­an­teed for­ever.”</p>
    <p>The speech came amid stalled talks aimed at dis­man­tling Py­ongyang’s nu­clear and mis­sile pro­grammes in ex­change for sanc­tions re­lief from Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim and United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump met for the first time in 2018 in Sin­ga­pore, rais­ing hopes for a ne­go­ti­ated end to North Korea’s nu­clear threats.</p>
    <p>But their sec­ond sum­mit, in Viet­nam last year, and sub­se­quent work­ing-level meet­ings fell apart.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang in­sists it needs its nu­clear arse­nal to de­ter against a pos­si­ble US in­va­sion.</p>
    <p>It has spent decades de­vel­op­ing its arse­nal and is in­ter­na­tion­ally iso­lated as a re­sult, sub­ject to mul­ti­ple United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil</p>
    <p>EF­FEC­TIVE NU­CLEAR DE­TER­RENT</p>
    <p>Thanks to our reliable and ef­fec­tive self-de­fen­sive nu­clear de­ter­rent, there will no longer be war, and our coun­try’s safety and fu­ture will be firmly ’’ guar­an­teed for­ever.</p>
    <p>NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN</p>
    <p>sanc­tions over its banned nu­clear weapons pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>In­ter-Korean re­la­tions have been in deep freeze for months, fol­low­ing the col­lapse of the Hanoi sum­mit between Mr Kim and Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>That nu­clear ne­go­ti­a­tion foundered on what the North would be will­ing to give up in ex­change for a loos­en­ing of sanc­tions. Mr Kim de­clared in De­cem­ber last year an end to mora­to­ri­ums on nu­clear and bal­lis­tic mis­sile tests, and Py­ongyang has re­peat­edly said it has no in­ten­tion to con­tinue talks un­less Wash­ing­ton drops what it de­scribes as “hos­tile” poli­cies to­wards the North.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has called for a “com­plete, ver­i­fi­able and ir­re­versible” de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion be­fore North Korea can re­ceive re­lief from sanc­tions chok­ing its pal­try econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang’s lead­ers see giv­ing up the weapons as po­lit­i­cal sui­cide, and Mr Kim has been busy adding to his stock­pile of nu­clear war­heads and mis­siles.</p>
    <p>The Kim regime also has an in­cen­tive to keep ten­sions from get­ting out of con­trol and prompt­ing more in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim’s de­ci­sion to shut borders in Jan­uary due to the coro­n­avirus slammed the brakes on the lit­tle le­gal trade the state has, and could send the econ­omy into its big­gest con­trac­tion in more than two decades, ac­cord­ing to Fitch So­lu­tions.</p>
