    <p>As many in the coun­try were count­ing down to bid good­bye to the Covid-19 year at 11.59pm on Thurs­day, three cou­ples in the de­liv­ery wards of three hos­pi­tals were about to meet their newborns.</p>
    <p>At the stroke of mid­night, doc­tors at Raf­fles Hospi­tal, Mount Alver­nia Hospi­tal and Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hospi­tal de­liv­ered Sin­ga­pore’s New Year babies of 2021.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, at 2pm on Thurs­day, soon-to-be par­ents Audrey Tjioe, 31, and Zemin Tan, 32, were hav­ing a leisurely New Year’s Eve lunch with fam­ily when Ms Tjioe “felt a gush of wa­ter” as her wa­ter broke.</p>
    <p>It was then a fren­zied rush to Raf­fles Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>“We weren’t ex­pect­ing it to hap­pen so early as our doc­tor told us to be ad­mit­ted only in the evening,” said Ms Tjioe, who works in a re­cruit­ment firm.</p>
    <p>At night, her con­trac­tions be­came more fre­quent and it was time to push at 11.25pm.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tan, a fi­nan­cial ad­viser: “At 11pm, when the baby wasn’t out yet, we thought there could be a chance that our child might be the first baby of the new year.”</p>
    <p>“So, it was an en­cour­age­ment to her to try to push harder and faster,” he added.</p>
    <p>At ex­actly mid­night, their daugh­ter, Avery Tan, was born.</p>
    <p>They de­cided on the name months ago, and Mr Tan said it “sounds catchy”. He added: “It also means ‘ruler’, so it could mean that she could achieve great things in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tjioe said hav­ing a healthy baby was most im­por­tant, but giv­ing birth at the start of the new year was the ic­ing on the cake.</p>
    <p>Added Mr Tan: “She is our first­born, and also hap­pened to be a New Year baby. That’s not a very com­mon thing.”</p>
    <p>At Mount Alver­nia Hospi­tal, Ms Yu Hui-Lan, 32, and Mr David Chan, 36, also had their daugh­ter at mid­night. The cou­ple, who also have a two-year-old son, have not de­cided on their daugh­ter’s name yet.</p>
    <p>Ms Yu was hop­ing to give birth by Dec 31, to avoid hav­ing to un­dergo labour in­duc­tion a week later.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to wait another week, and thank­fully I went into labour at 4.30pm on Thurs­day,” said the housewife.</p>
    <p>The sil­ver lin­ing in be­ing preg­nant dur­ing a pan­demic year was hav­ing her en­gi­neer hus­band by her side ev­ery day while he worked from home. “Dur­ing my first preg­nancy, I was alone at home and lonely. This time, my hus­band and I bonded more and went out hunt­ing for nice food. My moods were bet­ter,” said Ms Yu.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s third New Year baby, a boy, was born at mid­night at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morning, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Indranee Ra­jah vis­ited three other fam­i­lies who had babies af­ter mid­night at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal (KKH).</p>
    <p>The hospi­tal’s first New Year baby, a boy, was born at 12.10am.</p>
    <p>“The (three) mums were very tired and re­lieved, and just very happy that their babies were born safely,” Ms Indranee told the me­dia af­ter her visit. She also vis­ited Sin­ga­pore’s only hu­man milk bank, which is in KKH.</p>
