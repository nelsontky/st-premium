    <p>NEW YORK • Coach Mike D’An­toni and gen­eral man­ager Daryl Morey de­parted the Hous­ton Rock­ets in the off-sea­son and Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) star James Har­den could be the next one out the door.</p>
    <p>The All-Star guard has de­clined Hous­ton’s of­fer of a con­tract that would pay him an NBA-record US$50 mil­lion (S$67.2 mil­lion) a sea­son, and he in­stead is look­ing to en­gi­neer a trade that would send him to the Brook­lyn Nets, ESPN re­ported on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the report, Har­den turned down an ex­ten­sion for two years and US$103 mil­lion be­yond the ex­ist­ing three years and US$133 mil­lion on his con­tract.</p>
    <p>He is re­port­edly in con­tact with Nets for­ward Kevin Du­rant and guard Kyrie Irv­ing in hopes of form­ing a “Big Three” in Brook­lyn.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there has been no “mean­ing­ful di­a­logue” be­tween the Nets and the Rock­ets about a Har­den deal, re­ported ESPN.</p>
    <p>D’An­toni parted ways with the Rock­ets in Septem­ber af­ter the team lost to even­tual cham­pi­ons Los An­ge­les Lak­ers in the Western Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals and is now the as­sis­tant to new Brook­lyn head coach Steve Nash.</p>
    <p>Morey quit his post with Hous­ton on Oct 15, two weeks be­fore the team hired Stephen Si­las as their new head coach. He is now the pres­i­dent of bas­ket­ball op­er­a­tions at the Philadel­phia 76ers.</p>
    <p>The New York Times re­ported that Har­den had wanted the team to hire Ty­ronn Lue, who is now the head coach of the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers, or pro­mote Rock­ets’ player de­vel­op­ment coach John Lu­cas as D’An­toni’s re­place­ment.</p>
    <p>Har­den, 31, has led the NBA in scor­ing each of the past three sea­sons. In 2019-20, he av­er­aged 34.3 points, 6.6 re­bounds, 7.5 as­sists and 1.8 steals in 68 games.</p>
    <p>He has reached the NBA Fi­nals once – play­ing along­side Du­rant with the 2011-12 Ok­la­homa City Thun­der team – and the Western Con­fer­ence fi­nals three other times but has yet to win a cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Du­rant, 32, is set to re­turn in 2020-21 af­ter miss­ing all of last sea­son due to a torn Achilles ten­don.</p>
    <p>He has two cham­pi­onship rings from his time with the Golden State War­riors, win­ning NBA Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player twice.</p>
    <p>Irv­ing, 28, joined the Nets last sea­son af­ter pre­vi­ous stints in Cleve­land and Bos­ton, but a shoul­der op­er­a­tion in Fe­bru­ary ended his sea­son early. He was a key part of the Cava­liers’ 2015-16 cham­pi­onship team along­side LeBron James.</p>
