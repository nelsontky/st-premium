    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Try to go slower – take care and make sure ev­ery­thing goes right. Your peo­ple may be im­pa­tient, but it is bet­ter to avoid mis­takes for now.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You may meet an un­usual spir­i­tual ad­viser. It could be a crush, a quiet per­son at work or even some­one ask­ing for spare change.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your head is swim­ming be­cause your en­ergy is out of sync with ideas you have to con­front. You should be back in the game in a few days.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple may not un­der­stand you at the mo­ment, so it is a good time for you to hun­ker down and fo­cus on your own needs and projects.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Some­one near you needs help, so open your eyes and heart.</p>
    <p>Get your friends to pitch in, as your lead­er­ship qual­i­ties are in fo­cus.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your am­bi­tion is lead­ing the way and mak­ing sure you are tak­ing life se­ri­ously. Step up and chal­lenge your­self in a new way.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your nos­tal­gia is a pow­er­ful force – but that may not be pos­i­tive. Try not to let your­self get wrapped up in wor­ries over what could have been.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Start some­thing new, es­pe­cially if it in­volves sign­ing a con­tract or en­ter­ing an­other for­mal agree­ment. You feel the urge to set down roots.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You may find it hard to rec­on­cile your deeper needs with more im­me­di­ate con­cerns, but things should still shake out for the best.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You can be great when it comes to mak­ing a difference in the world. With your ac­com­plish­ments, you have earned a place in the spotlight.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You do not un­der­stand the cur­rent big drama, but some­times you have to act on in­stinct with­out wor­ry­ing too much about your peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is right for tak­ing com­mand, but that does not mean you want it or that you are the best can­di­date. Keep your eyes clear.</p>
