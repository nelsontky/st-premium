    <p>Know what your favourite singer looks like? Strangely, some fans do not.</p>
    <p>And how can they if their beloved per­form­ers have never re­vealed their faces in pub­lic?</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, a hand­ful of mys­te­ri­ous mu­si­cians have emerged, cov­er­ing up their faces in pub­lic­ity ma­te­ri­als and live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>A trade­mark of some acts in elec­tronic and heavy metal mu­sic, the phe­nom­e­non seems to have en­tered the main­stream.</p>
    <p>Pop su­per­star Lady Gaga made a few ap­pear­ances with a wrappedup face in the 2010s and Aus­tralian singer-song­writer Sia has been con­ceal­ing her face be­hind wigs from the early 2010s.</p>
    <p>The lat­est mu­si­cian to cover up is Tai­wanese new­comer ?te, whose first al­bum A Bed­room Of One’s Own was re­leased in July. Her name is pro­nounced “why-te”, sim­i­lar to the word “white”.</p>
    <p>In a Google Meet call from Taipei, the singer-song­writer tells The Straits Times she dons a large hat when­ever there are cam­eras around to pro­tect her pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old did not ap­pear on video, but says she was a for­mer health­care worker.</p>
    <p>“I can’t re­veal my iden­tity be­cause I might go back to work in a hos­pi­tal,” she says. “So right from the start, I told my record la­bel that it is not con­ve­nient to let ev­ery­one know who I am and what I look like.”</p>
    <p>So the la­bel, Chy­naHouse Dig­i­tal, gave her two big hats – a black, wide-brimmed hat and an­other black bucket hat.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing a live show, it can feel very hot wear­ing a hat and I can­not see much of the stage or au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>But I never re­move the hat be­cause it lets me have a pri­vate life.”</p>
    <p>She knows that fans try to catch glimpses of her face from low an­gles, but says: “They can take pho­tos only of my chin. My eyes are al­ways buried in the hat.”</p>
    <p>One up­side of cov­er­ing up is that she can still do or­di­nary things such as buy food from a food stand, wear­ing shorts and slip­pers.</p>
    <p>It is this pri­vacy she wants to pro­tect and keep sep­a­rate from her mu­sic ca­reer.</p>
    <p>She says: “I think au­di­ences tend to ex­pect fe­male celebri­ties to look a cer­tain way and I am not brave enough to face that scru­tiny. I would rather the au­di­ence fo­cus on my mu­sic rather than my face.”</p>
    <p>Feed­back has been mixed, she says. “Some fans are very sup­port­ive. But there are oth­ers who think I am do­ing it for pub­lic­ity or I am putting on airs. I al­ways tell them that I cover up be­cause I need to.”</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, a singing com­pe­ti­tion where con­tes­tants do not have to show their faces has been pick­ing up steam.</p>
    <p>Started in 2018, the Ra­dio Singer con­test is or­gan­ised by Man­darin ra­dio sta­tion UFM100.3, which is part of SPH Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Its third edi­tion is on­go­ing and has drawn a record num­ber of en­tries with more than 4,000 au­dio clips sub­mit­ted. Con­tes­tants’ iden­ti­ties are known only to the or­gan­is­ers and kept hid­den through­out, even af­ter the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, 100 song en­tries have been short­listed and peo­ple can vote for their favourite en­tries at ufm1003.sg un­til 8am on Satur­day. Af­ter an­other phase of vot­ing, the fi­nals will take place at 7.30pm on Sept 24 on air as well as the ra­dio sta­tion’s Face­book page (www.face­book.com/UFM1003).</p>
    <p>Last year’s win­ner went by the name Bad­minton Team Cap­tain. Dur­ing the fi­nale, she sang a cover of the Tia Ray song Think Dif­fer­ent while wear­ing a box on her head. Af­ter win­ning, she flashed her face briefly.</p>
