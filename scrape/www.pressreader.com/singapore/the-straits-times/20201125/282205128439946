    <p>A scheme to help young chil­dren from low-in­come homes is get­ting a boost with a new tie-up among sev­eral part­ners to pro­vide train­ing across dif­fer­ent fields for prac­ti­tion­ers.</p>
    <p>The Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency (ECDA) and Te­masek Foun­da­tion (TF), in part­ner­ship with Nanyang Polytech­nic (NYP) and the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences (SUSS), launched a train­ing pro­gramme yes­ter­day for those who work with chil­dren from less well-off fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>In a joint me­dia state­ment, ECDA and TF said the pro­gramme, which is the first of its kind here, aims to bet­ter sup­port KidS­tart prac­ti­tion­ers in the ar­eas of child de­vel­op­ment, health and so­cial work, which are nec­es­sary for early child­hood in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>KidS­tart is a gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tive that helps chil­dren up to six from low-in­come fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The new Multi-Dis­ci­plinary Pro­gramme for En­hanc­ing Child De­vel­op­ment an­nounced yes­ter­day com­prises two parts: a foun­da­tional train­ing pro­gramme con­ducted by NYP, and an in-ser­vice train­ing pro­gramme by SUSS.</p>
    <p>TF has com­mit­ted $1.15 mil­lion to sup­port the train­ing of 300 prac­ti­tion­ers over three years.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tional train­ing con­ducted by NYP in col­lab­o­ra­tion with KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal and Na­tional In­sti­tute of Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment, pro­vides prac­ti­tion­ers with lim­ited or no prior work ex­pe­ri­ence with young chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies, with a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the chal­lenges they face.</p>
    <p>Ba­sic con­cepts and the­o­ries around child de­vel­op­ment, health and nu­tri­tion and so­cial work do­mains are also cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­ri­enced prac­ti­tion­ers may go a step fur­ther by tak­ing one or more of seven con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing mod­ules con­ducted by SUSS. Top­ics range from how chil­dren learn to their health, growth and well-be­ing as well as skills needed for in­ter­views, home vis­its and tack­ling fam­ily is­sues.</p>
    <p>Those who com­plete all seven mod­ules will re­ceive a Cer­tifi­cate in Child and Fam­ily In­ter­ven­tion. Other so­cial ser­vice or early child­hood prac­ti­tion­ers work­ing with needy young chil­dren may also sign up for the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>KidS­tart, which be­gan in 2016, plans to scale up its reach to 5,000 more chil­dren in the next three years. Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing said in the state­ment: “The early years of a child are very im­por­tant in set­ting a strong foun­da­tion for their later years. A child’s de­vel­op­ment is con­tin­gent on many fac­tors such as health and nu­tri­tion, fam­ily sup­port and op­por­tu­ni­ties for learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“As we ex­pand KidS­tart to help more low-in­come fam­i­lies, we will have to en­sure that those work­ing with young chil­dren have the right knowl­edge and skills to sup­port KidS­tart chil­dren and their fam­i­lies holis­ti­cally.”</p>
    <p>Ms Jas­mine Low, a med­i­cal so­cial worker from the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal who took part in the foun­da­tional train­ing, said she now un­der­stands bet­ter how the KidS­tart model works with mul­ti­ple com­mu­nity part­ners, and how NUH can con­trib­ute through health and nu­tri­tion sup­port for vul­ner­a­ble fam­i­lies via home vis­its.</p>
    <p>Ms Cindy Loh, as­sis­tant direc­tor of KidS­tart’s home vis­i­ta­tion pro­gramme, said the SUSS mod­ules she took help prac­ti­tion­ers carry out their roles more ef­fec­tively. Cit­ing the mod­ule on the Abe­cedar­ian Ap­proach, which em­pha­sises lan­guage de­vel­op­ment and qual­ity one-to-one adultchild in­ter­ac­tions, as an ex­am­ple, she said the strate­gies helped par­ents to bond more mean­ing­fully with their chil­dren while help­ing them to learn at the same time.</p>
    <p>“With the mul­ti­ple needs and dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tions our fam­i­lies are in, mod­ules such as child health, growth and well-be­ing were help­ful in pro­vid­ing ad­di­tional in­sights to what prac­ti­tion­ers should look out for,” she added.</p>
