    <p>1 2 cops shot in US protests</p>
    <p>Two po­lice of­fi­cers were shot and wounded on Wed­nes­day in Louisville, Ken­tucky, dur­ing protests against a grand jury rul­ing de­cried as a mis­car­riage of jus­tice in the fatal po­lice shoot­ing of Ms Bre­onna Tay­lor, a black med­i­cal worker, in March. The grand jury de­cided not to charge any of­fi­cer in the killing of Ms Tay­lor. WORLD</p>
    <p>LOUISVILLE • Two po­lice of­fi­cers were shot and wounded late on Wed­nes­day i n Louisville, Ken­tucky, dur­ing protests against a US grand jury rul­ing de­cried by civil rights ac­tivists as a mis­car­riage of jus­tice in the fatal po­lice shoot­ing of Ms Bre­onna Tay­lor in March.</p>
    <p>The grand jury de­cided that none of the three white of­fi­cers in­volved in the deadly po­lice raid on Ms Tay­lor’s apart­ment would be charged over caus­ing her death, though one of­fi­cer was in­dicted on charges of en­dan­ger­ing her neighbours.</p>
    <p>The in­dict­ment came more than six months af­ter Ms Tay­lor, 26, a black emer­gency med­i­cal tech­ni­cian and as­pir­ing nurse, was killed in front of her armed boyfriend af­ter the three of­fi­cers forced their way into her home with a search war­rant in a drug traf­fick­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Her death be­came a sym­bol, and her image a fa­mil­iar sight, dur­ing months of daily protests against racial in­jus­tice and po­lice bru­tal­ity in cities across the United States.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the grand jury an­nounce­ment, pro­test­ers took to the streets of Ken­tucky’s largest city and marched for hours, chant­ing “No lives mat­ter un­til black lives mat­ter”, amid spo­radic clashes with po­lice in riot gear.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tions re­mained mostly peace­ful un­til sev­eral gun­shots rang out as heav­ily armed po­lice closed in on a throng of pro­test­ers at night­fall ahead of a 9pm cur­few due to take ef­fect. Gun­fire erupted from the crowd mo­ments af­ter po­lice fired chem­i­cal ir­ri­tants and “flash-bang” rounds.</p>
    <p>Two of­fi­cers were shot and wounded, in­terim Louisville Metropoli­tan Po­lice chief Robert Schroeder said. One sus­pect was ar­rested, and the two wounded of­fi­cers were in sta­ble con­di­tion with non-life-threat­en­ing in­juries.</p>
    <p>The crowds largely dis­si­pated af­ter the shoot­ing. Po­lice said at least 46 ar­rests were made in all.</p>
    <p>Sym­pa­thy protests of vary­ing sizes also were held on Wed­nes­day in sev­eral other cities, in­clud­ing New York, Wash­ing­ton, At­lanta and Chicago.</p>
    <p>US Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den said the grand jury failed to de­liver jus­tice for Ms Tay­lor but held out hope that the fed­eral probe would do so. He also urged that protests be peace­ful.</p>
    <p>“Do not sully her (Ms Tay­lor’s) memory or her mother’s by en­gag­ing in any vi­o­lence,” he said.</p>
    <p>Later in the day, Mr Bi­den said black turnout was the linch­pin to his hopes of win­ning the White House in Novem­ber and re­vers­ing eco­nomic and so­cial in­equities that have held back African Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>“There’s only one way to do it. We’ve gotta show up and vote.”</p>
    <p>Race re­la­tions have re-emerged as a flash­point in US pol­i­tics this year in the wake of killings of black Amer­i­cans by po­lice.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said on Twit­ter that he was pray­ing for the two of­fi­cers shot on Wed­nes­day.</p>
