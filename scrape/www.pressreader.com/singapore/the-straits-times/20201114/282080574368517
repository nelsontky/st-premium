    <p>A sur­vey con­ducted in March to April found that 19 per cent of In­dian mil­len­ni­als were not in­ter­ested in ei­ther mar­riage or hav­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>one into this world when I don’t have enough money to run my liveli­hood. How can I com­pel an­other per­son to live the same way as I am now?”</p>
    <p>LESS FO­CUS ON SET­TLING DOWN</p>
    <p>Youth across Asia are fight­ing bat­tles sim­i­lar to Mr Ra­man’s, pri­ori­tis­ing ca­reers and fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity amid the pan­demic’s tur­moil and fo­cus­ing less on mar­riage and par­ent­hood.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey con­ducted in March to April found that 19 per cent of In­dian mil­len­ni­als were not in­ter­ested in ei­ther mar­riage or hav­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, the num­ber of marriages be­tween May and July fell 36.9 per cent from last year. The num­ber of re­ported preg­nan­cies also fell 11.4 per cent in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, too, has seen a sim­i­lar grow­ing trend of mar­ry­ing later or not at all among both gen­ders in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>A pub­lic re­la­tions pro­fes­sional based in the city, Mr Matthew Lai, 28, says he has de­layed plans to get mar­ried as his part­ner has been stuck in Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>“It has de­layed our mar­riage plans and it might de­lay us hav­ing kids and other things – but the plan is still there,” he says.</p>
    <p>In some cases, the pan­demic also pro­vided cou­ples the op­por­tu­nity to end abu­sive re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>In Kuala Lumpur, Ms Na­dia Ab­dul­lah, 32, a mother of two, walked out of an un­happy mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Be­ing “locked up” for sev­eral months in the same house with her abu­sive hus­band dur­ing a par­tial lock­down con­vinced her that life is too short to spend it with some­one with his tem­per­a­ment.</p>
    <p>“For eight years, I put up with his ev­ery whim, ver­bal abuse and in­fi­delity. He knew how much I loved our lit­tle fam­ily, that’s why he used it as a ‘weapon’ to con­trol me,” the kinder­garten teacher tells The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Her di­vorce was fi­nalised in Septem­ber. “I’ve been hap­pier since,” she says.</p>
    <p>There are also those like Ms Shailja Tan­don, a 30-year-old re­search as­so­ciate at a Delhi-based so­cial sci­ence in­sti­tu­tion, who thinks the pan­demic would not have held her back from mar­ry­ing if she had found some­one com­pat­i­ble.</p>
    <p>“I’d much rather pre­fer the in­ti­mate pan­demic ver­sion of a wed­ding, which in­volves less so­ci­etal tra­di­tions and is more about the cou­ple’s union,” she says.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has acted like a good cat­a­lyst to let go of cer­tain prac­tices, such as those re­lated to gift­ing that weighed more heav­ily on girls and their fam­i­lies, ones I have al­ways been against.” in Kuala Lumpur and Wal­ter Sim in Tokyo</p>
