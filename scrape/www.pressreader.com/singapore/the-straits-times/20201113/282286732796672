    <p>With just three touches of the ball, Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional striker Khairul Nizam showed the ta­lent that had him ear­marked as a po­ten­tial star but whose flashes of bril­liance have only been fleet­ing.</p>
    <p>When Shah Shahi­ran’s stray pass found its way to Nizam, there seemed lit­tle dan­ger for Tampines Rovers and their de­fence.</p>
    <p>But the Ea­gles for­ward, spot­ting goal­keeper Syazwan Buhari off his line, struck a stun­ning 35-me­tre equaliser for a valu­able point against the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) lead­ers last week.</p>
    <p>Nizam then pointed to the skies in cel­e­bra­tion. He later ex­plained it was a trib­ute to his Sin­ga­pore Un­der-18 coach Salim Moin, who died the night be­fore on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>He said: “Coach Salim used to tell us, ‘Why drib­ble when you can shoot? Don’t drib­ble so much and waste your en­ergy.’ (Gey­lang as­sis­tant coach V. Kanan) told me coach Salim used to score this type of long-range goals as a player, and I want to ded­i­cate my goal to him... We were all very sad to learn of his pass­ing, and miss him dearly.”</p>
    <p>It has been more than a decade since he burst onto the scene as a pre­co­cious No. 9, whom former na­tional coach Rado­jko Avramovic had tipped to even­tu­ally lead the line for the na­tional team.</p>
    <p>But ill dis­ci­pline and bad luck with in­juries meant he has yet to ful­fil those ex­pec­ta­tions. He has 24 caps for Sin­ga­pore but has yet to score an in­ter­na­tional goal.</p>
    <p>Last year, he man­aged four goals in the Sin­ga­pore Cup for War­riors FC but failed to score in 10 SPL games. The 29-year-old has struck four times this sea­son for Gey­lang to be­come the lead­ing lo­cal scorer, a wor­ry­ing prospect for to­mor­row’s op­po­nents Al­birex Ni­igata.</p>
    <p>Nizam in­sists he is a changed man af­ter get­ting mar­ried in 2017 and is now de­ter­mined to make the most of the re­main­der of his ca­reer. Those goals in­clude play­ing over­seas, adding to his 2015 Malaysian FA Cup medal and end­ing that drought with the Lions.</p>
    <p>He said: “I was play­ful and happy-go-lucky back then, and there was a lot of pres­sure and ex­pec­ta­tion on me, which I didn’t know how to cope with.</p>
    <p>“But now that I have a fam­ily de­pend­ing on me, I am more fo­cused. My mind is clearer, and I’m no longer the kid I was. I want to be re­mem­bered for the right rea­sons and not as a wasted ta­lent.</p>
    <p>“I’m thank­ful Gey­lang signed me af­ter War­riors had to sit out. Like the na­tional team, Gey­lang have a Ja­panese style of play with high press and quick coun­ters. We have to be fit to play this style, and I’m look­ing for­ward to re­pay­ing the club’s faith in me.”</p>
    <p>The Ea­gles are sixth in the eight­team ta­ble with 10 points, one be­hind Lion City Sailors in fifth, four be­hind Al­birex (sec­ond), and seven adrift of Tampines.</p>
    <p>The top se­nior lo­cal team will</p>
    <p>Goals by Khairul Nizam, the SPL’s lead­ing lo­cal scorer. qual­ify for the AFC Cham­pi­ons League group stage, while the next two will play in the AFC Cup.</p>
    <p>Ea­gles coach Noor Ali is re­ly­ing on Nizam, who has scored in his last three league games, to trou­ble Al­birex at Our Tampines Hub.</p>
    <p>Noor Ali, 45, said: “For the long­est time, Sin­ga­pore have not had a No. 9 like Nizam, who can hold up play and make good runs be­hind the de­fence. Af­ter Fandi Ah­mad, I think he is the best header of the ball in re­cent times.”</p>
    <p>The former Sin­ga­pore in­ter­na­tional also has a good record against the Ja­panese out­fit af­ter tak­ing charge of Gey­lang last year. He won two of their three league games last year, los­ing the other.</p>
    <p>The Ea­gles were with­out a win in 18 league games against Al­birex from 2012 to 2018.</p>
    <p>Noor Ali said: “Al­birex will be tough be­cause they are tech­ni­cally sound and en­er­getic. Give them time and space, they will kill you.</p>
    <p>“We have proven if we are dis­ci­plined, com­pact, and not afraid to play our foot­ball, we can match any team, so hope­fully we will be able to do that against Al­birex.”</p>
