    <p>Five of the eight new com­mu­nity cases of Covid-19 in­fec­tion re­ported yes­ter­day were part of a family clus­ter in­volv­ing two house­holds, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>In its daily up­date yes­ter­day, the min­istry added that these in­di­vid­u­als had par­tic­i­pated in family gath­er­ings, and in­ves­ti­ga­tions were on­go­ing on whether any safe dis­tanc­ing rules were breached.</p>
    <p>“We take a se­ri­ous view of such breaches and will not hes­i­tate to take en­force­ment ac­tion against any of­fend­ers,” added MOH.</p>
    <p>The eight com­mu­nity cases re­ported yes­ter­day com­prise seven Sin­ga­pore­ans and one 37-year-old In­dian work pass holder, who was de­tected as a re­sult of rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors who are stay­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­porean com­mu­nity case re­ported yes­ter­day is a col­league of a pre­vi­ous case who worked at a cam­era shop in Ex­cel­sior Shop­ping Cen­tre, and had ear­lier been placed on quar­an­tine, added MOH.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure fol­low­ing the de­tec­tion of an ear­lier case who had vis­ited the shop dur­ing the pre­vi­ous case’s in­fec­tious pe­riod, MOH has iden­ti­fied and con­tacted 240 in­di­vid­u­als who vis­ited the shop be­tween Aug 15 and Aug 18.</p>
    <p>MOH has fa­cil­i­tated Covid-19 test­ing for all of them, even though the risk of in­fec­tion for vis­i­tors was as­sessed to be low. So far, a to­tal of 224 in­di­vid­u­als have been swabbed and the re­sults are pend­ing, added MOH.</p>
    <p>The cam­era shop was an­nounced as a new clus­ter yes­ter­day, as one of the newly con­firmed cases was linked to three pre­vi­ous cases.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing Sin­ga­porean case had gone to see a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner last Thurs­day, was di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion, and given a swab test.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions for the only non-Sin­ga­porean com­mu­nity case – who is un­linked – are in progress, and all the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the case have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod. Sero­log­i­cal tests for his house­hold con­tacts will also be con­ducted to de­ter­mine if he could have been in­fected by them, added MOH.</p>
    <p>Other than seven im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 39 of the 54 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,771.</p>
    <p>Among the seven im­ported cases, one is a Sin­ga­porean re­turn­ing from the United Arab Emi­rates and four are per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­turn­ing from In­dia, Bangladesh and the Philip­pines. The sixth is a work per­mit holder from the Philip­pines and the last is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder from Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and tested while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased, to an av­er­age of three cases a day in the past week, from two in the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>MOH said an­other 139 cases were dis­charged yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of those who have fully re­cov­ered to 55,571.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 74 con­firmed cases re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 1,084 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties, with none in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
