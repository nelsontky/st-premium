    <p>Sin­ga­pore moved to make its laws more nav­i­ga­ble, ac­ces­si­ble and eas­ily un­der­stood, with Par­lia­ment pass­ing the Statute Law Re­form Bill yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The new law will pro­vide for the greater use of sim­pli­fied lan­guage in leg­is­la­tion, for ex­am­ple through the re­moval of lengthy phrases and ar­chaic words such as “here­inafter” and “hereby”, shorter sen­tences, more para­graph­ing, and re­plac­ing “shall” with “must” to sig­nify le­gal obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong gave these ex­am­ples dur­ing the de­bate on the Bill yes­ter­day. He shared that from 2011 to 2015, 160 Bills were in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment. From 2015 to 2020, this rose to 225, with the length of each Bill also in­creas­ing over time.</p>
    <p>As the Sin­ga­pore Statute Book grows in size, it is even more im­por­tant that laws re­main “user­friendly”, said Mr Tong, adding that since 2014 a con­scious at­tempt has been made to use plain English while draft­ing new laws.</p>
    <p>He noted that Sin­ga­pore’s Law Re­vi­sion Com­mis­sion has been work­ing on a re­vised edi­tion of the en­tire Statute Book since Au­gust 2017. This will be the first universal re­vi­sion since the 1985 edi­tion, which con­tained 387 Acts and num­bered about 8,000 pages. The 2020 edi­tion is es­ti­mated to con­tain about 510 Acts and 27,000 pages.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new law, Law Re­vi­sion Com­mis­sion­ers will have ad­di­tional pow­ers to make ed­i­to­rial changes to align leg­is­la­tion with mod­ern draft­ing prac­tices, but with­out chang­ing their mean­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other part of the new law will re­peal ob­so­lete laws – such as an Act en­acted in 1941 to com­pen­sate war in­juries sus­tained by work­ers or civil de­fence vol­un­teers dur­ing World War II.</p>
    <p>The Bill also sup­ports Covid-19 con­ti­nu­ity ar­range­ments for par­lia­men­tary sit­tings, by amend­ing the def­i­ni­tion of “Par­lia­ment” to in­clude not just Par­lia­ment House but also any other place ap­pointed by the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In May last year, the Con­sti­tu­tion was amended to en­able Par­lia­ment and its MPs to meet in mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions in times of ex­i­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>The new law fur­ther clar­i­fies that priv­i­leges, pow­ers and im­mu­ni­ties of Par­lia­ment and its mem­bers will ex­tend to all places ap­pointed by the Pres­i­dent un­der the con­ti­nu­ity ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>It also up­dates the sys­tem for del­e­ga­tion of min­is­te­rial func­tions, by cre­at­ing a two-tier frame­work for del­e­gat­ing to ei­ther po­lit­i­cal of­fice­hold­ers in the same min­istry, or pub­lic of­fi­cers and pub­lic bod­ies.</p>
    <p>“This will help to en­sure that pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion is car­ried out smoothly and ef­fi­ciently to meet the chal­lenges of the day,” said Mr Tong. “The re­spon­si­ble min­is­ter re­mains ac­count­able to Par­lia­ment for how a func­tion is per­formed by his or her del­e­gate.”</p>
