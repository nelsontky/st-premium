    <p>LA ROCHE-SUR-FORON • Pri­moz Roglic re­tained his lead on Slove­nian com­pa­triot Tadej Po­gacar atop the Tour de France stand­ings af­ter Stage 18 as Bri­tish out­fit Ineos Gre­nadiers claimed a one-two fin­ish yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Bedev­illed by in­jury prob­lems that saw them with­draw their cap­tain and de­fend­ing cham­pion Egan Ber­nal on Wed­nes­day, Pol­ish team­mate Michal Kwiatkowsk­i won the stage, a 175km ride from Meri­bel, as</p>
    <p>Ecuador’s Richard Cara­paz took the King of the Moun­tains jer­sey.</p>
    <p>The pair crossed the fin­ish line two min­utes ahead of the elite pack, as Bel­gian Wout van Aert took third place.</p>
    <p>“I had the best legs ever, the way we rode to­gether with Richard was just in­cred­i­ble,” said Kwiatkowsk­i, a for­mer world cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“When Egan left the race, he was very sad but wished us well, and now we have this won­der­ful day.</p>
    <p>That’s the Tour de France.</p>
    <p>“This is an in­cred­i­ble day for us. I’ll never for­get that.</p>
    <p>“I get nice mo­ments in cy­cling but this one gave me goose­bumps in the last kilo­me­tres, I don’t know how many but the gap was so big that we knew we were go­ing to make it...</p>
    <p>“We put on some show to­day and we de­serve a big cel­e­bra­tion.”</p>
    <p>In the race for the over­all stand­ings, only tomorrow’s in­di­vid­ual time trial presents a chance for the sec­ond-placed Po­gacar to stage a coup.</p>
    <p>Roglic leads Po­gacar by 57 sec­onds with to­day’s Stage 19 and the cul­mi­nat­ing run up the Champs-El­y­sees on Sun­day both set to be de­cided in a mass bunch sprint.</p>
    <p>Stage 17 solo win­ner Miguel An­gel Lopez of Colom­bia is still third, 1min 27sec off the lead, but is less of a time trial spe­cial­ist than his ri­vals.</p>
