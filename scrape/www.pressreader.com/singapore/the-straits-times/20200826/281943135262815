    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s ad­dress at the open­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s 14th Par­lia­ment on Monday in­voked the power and value of par­lia­men­tary democ­racy at a time of pro­found eco­nomic and so­cial change here. The House will have to take cru­cial de­ci­sions on three fronts: tackle the epi­demi­o­log­i­cal, eco­nomic and so­cial con­se­quences of Covid-19, carry the econ­omy through the post­Covid-19 phase, and meet Sin­ga­pore’s longer-term chal­lenges. In that con­text, Sin­ga­pore­ans will as­sess MPs by their abil­ity to re­flect chang­ing ex­pec­ta­tions on the ground, par­tic­u­larly among the young, but hold on also to the fun­da­men­tals that have brought Sin­ga­pore this far. Par­lia­ment must strad­dle both cur­rent re­al­i­ties and new ex­pec­ta­tions as it pre­pares Sin­ga­pore for the near fu­ture and for a time well beyond the pass­ing of the pan­demic. Of course, that longer term pe­riod would lie beyond the term of this Par­lia­ment. But the House owes it to Sin­ga­pore to act as a con­tin­u­ing bridge of tran­si­tion which started from the postin­de­pen­dence years, through this dif­fi­cult time of the Covid-19 out­break, and to an un­fold­ing fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The fun­da­men­tals re­main clear. Mul­tira­cial­ism, mer­i­toc­racy, hon­esty and ef­fi­ciency in ad­min­is­tra­tion and other ar­eas of public life, an open econ­omy, and an ef­fec­tive ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem must re­main at the heart of Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional ef­fort. Even coun­tries that en­joy vast nat­u­ral re­sources have floun­dered be­cause of gross de­fi­ciency in one or more of those ar­eas. With­out such re­sources, Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach and re­silience have been its great­est pro­tec­tion. Good gov­er­nance re­mains at the heart of this, and Par­lia­ment ex­ists to make the Gov­ern­ment ac­count­able to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there will be changes in some of these pro­cesses given gen­er­a­tional shifts in the pop­u­la­tion and changes in ex­pec­ta­tions. The tran­si­tion from Covid-19 to a new nor­mal will re­quire the econ­omy to move into higher gear. Cer­tain jobs will never re­turn and some sec­tors will wit­ness wrench­ing change. But the Gov­ern­ment and so­ci­ety will have to stay the course to pro­tect work­ers even if some ex­ist­ing jobs can­not be saved. The ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem has to play its part to equip a fu­ture gen­er­a­tion with the skills and mind­sets that they need to sur­vive and suc­ceed. Mer­i­toc­racy, which un­der­pins the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem as it does so­ci­ety at large, will need to broaden its am­bit so that in­her­ited ad­van­tages of wealth and sta­tus do not fore­close op­por­tu­ni­ties for the de­serv­ing. The work­ings of mul­tira­cial­ism may be ques­tioned by some, but it re­mains and needs to be reaf­firmed as one of the found­ing principles of na­tion­hood. Par­lia­ment will need to re­flect and di­rect these changes of mood and as­pi­ra­tions on the ground. The op­po­si­tion’s greater pres­ence al­lows it to con­test the Gov­ern­ment. It must not only have its own ideas but also needs to work with the Gov­ern­ment to create a sus­tain­able fu­ture for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
