    <p>Be­fore Chi­nese New Year, Singapore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s (SGH) de­part­ment of fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment and engi­neer­ing (FME) was ac­ti­vated to trans­form the hos­pi­tal into an out­break-ready zone.</p>
    <p>Within two days, staff had to con­vert the am­bu­la­tory surgery cen­tre into an ex­ten­sion of the emer­gency de­part­ment to hold pa­tients with coro­n­avirus symp­toms.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic surged, they con­verted a multi-storey carpark into a fever screen­ing area.</p>
    <p>This heavy lift­ing was not un­fa­mil­iar be­cause the de­part­ment and its part­ners from fa­cil­ity ser­vice com­pany ISS Singapore have been do­ing yearly drills and ex­er­cises to pre­pare for out­breaks since Sars in 2003.</p>
    <p>“Our mo­bil­i­sa­tion process was more unique and struc­tured com­pared with Sars be­cause we were more pre­pared this time,” said FME’s di­rec­tor Tay Kim Say, 64.</p>
    <p>But they did face un­fore­seen man­power and re­source is­sues.</p>
    <p>As 60 per cent of the de­part­ment’s con­trac­tors are mi­grant work­ers, they had to work with a smaller pool of peo­ple for a few weeks. This meant that the rest of the tech­ni­cians and con­trac­tors had to work 12-hour shifts and on some week­ends, said Mr Low Jee Keik, 58, ISS Singapore’s se­nior key ac­count man­ager. Pre­vi­ously, the con­trac­tors worked eight-hour shifts.</p>
    <p>Due to Malaysia’s lock­down, they were un­able to im­port ex­tra ma­te­ri­als to build makeshift fa­cil­i­ties. At one point, when the link bridge be­tween SGH’s Block 3 and Ou­tram Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal was con­verted into a pa­tient hold­ing area, there were in­suf­fi­cient par­ti­tion pan­els to block off the area.</p>
    <p>Des­per­ate times called for cre­ative so­lu­tions. The team re­called that a dis­used build­ing at 226 Ou­tram Road, which used to be­long to the hos­pi­tal and is now un­der the Singapore Land Au­thor­ity, had some old fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>The FME team brought over some metal cab­i­nets left out­side the build­ing and used them as makeshift par­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>“This also helped to save cost, and the nurses and se­cu­rity guards could store their uni­forms in the cab­i­nets,” said Mr Low.</p>
