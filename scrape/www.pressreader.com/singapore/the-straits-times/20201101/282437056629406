    <p>FIC­TION BURNT SUGAR</p>
    <p>By Avni Doshi</p>
    <p>Hamish Hamil­ton/ Pa­per­back/ 231 pages/ $32.10/ Avail­able at bit.ly/Burn­tSu­gar_AD</p>
    <p>“I would be ly­ing if I said that my mother’s mis­ery has never given me plea­sure.”</p>
    <p>This is the first of many barbs of truth un­leashed in Avni Doshi’s de­but, a lac­er­at­ing look at a toxic mother-daugh­ter re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>An­tara’s mother, Tara, is los­ing her mem­ory. She for­gets to pay the elec­tric­ity bill, the name of the road she lives on, what cen­tury it is.</p>
    <p>She claims to have bought ra­zors and threat­ens to use them if things</p>
    <p>“de­te­rio­r­i­ate”. She rips up An­tara’s art­works, douses them in al­co­hol and sets them on fire.</p>
    <p>An­tara feels her mother ne­glected her dur­ing the reck­less years that in­cluded a spir­i­tual in­ter­lude at an ashram as the guru’s lover, a stint beg­ging on the streets and an af­fair with a photograph­er, Reza Pine.</p>
    <p>Tara’s de­men­tia seems to her a fi­nal elu­sion of re­spon­si­bil­ity. An­tara – of Tara yet un-Tara – has spent years hon­ing her re­sent­ment like a blade, but now she can­not make her mother feel guilty about things she claims not to re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Doshi holds noth­ing back in this por­trait of warped moth­er­hood, of two women en­trenched in de­spis­ing one an­other, yet so in­ex­tri­ca­ble that they some­times slip into, even usurp each other’s places.</p>
    <p>She ex­cels in her con­trol of the novel’s sen­sory as­pects: as­sail­ing the reader with a mi­asma of de­tails, like in An­tara’s child­ish mem­ory of the ashram as a spit, sweat and sex-soaked night­mare.</p>
    <p>Else­where, she draws back with cool econ­omy, load­ing com­pact phrases with lay­ers, as in her de­scrip­tions of Dilip, An­tara’s af­flu­ent Amer­ica-bred hus­band, as a man who “breaks his ro­tis with two hands” and prizes his wife’s odour­less­ness in pun­gent Pune.</p>
    <p>Tara is a tal­ented cook and food fills the nar­ra­tive, be­gin­ning with the evoca­tive ti­tle, some­thing sweet that has been pushed too far.</p>
    <p>Doshi picks out tastes and scents that stick in the mind, like the pick­led Kash­miri gar­lic that Tara’s mother-in-law eats daily, filling their house with “the par­tic­u­lar smell of di­gested al­lium”.</p>
    <p>Both Tara and An­tara try con­stantly to es­cape: Tara, the far­ci­cal stric­tures of her mar­riage and so­ci­ety, but also the hurt she has caused oth­ers; An­tara, her body – first pu­berty “open­ing (her) up from the in­side” in un­con­trol­lable ways, then moth­er­hood, as she has her own daugh­ter and is dis­man­tled by the en­su­ing de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“Maybe this is the point of a preg­nancy, of moth­er­hood it­self,” she thinks. “A child to undo the woman who bears it, to pull her safely apart.”</p>
    <p>Above all, they try to es­cape each other and fail, bring­ing the novel to its febrile cli­max. Moth­er­hood means not be­ing able to choose who you love. But it is love, how­ever much it hurts.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Ev­ery­thing Un­der by Daisy John­son (Vin­tage, 2018, $18.95, avail­able at bit.ly/ Every­thingUn­der_DJ), an­other Booker-short­listed de­but about a fraught mother-daugh­ter re­la­tion­ship. In this Oedi­pal retelling, Gre­tel is con­fronted with the de­men­tia-stricken mother who aban­doned her 16 years ago af­ter rais­ing her on a canal house­boat.</p>
