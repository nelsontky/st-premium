    <p>Even be­fore the mid­dle of the year was up, the num­ber of cases of so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation scams here had al­ready more than dou­bled in the span of two months.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said yes­ter­day that they re­ceived at least 1,000 re­ports of such scams i n the first five months of the year.</p>
    <p>This was up from 466 cases in the first three months. This means the num­ber of cases more than dou­bled in two months.</p>
    <p>Vic­tims were cheated of at least $2.2 mil­lion from Jan­uary to May, more than double the $1 mil­lion lost from Jan­uary to March. In most of the cases, the vic­tims were tricked into dis­clos­ing their credit card in­for­ma­tion and one-time pass­words to scam­mers, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Scam­mers of­ten used com­pro­mised or spoofed so­cial me­dia ac­counts on Face­book or In­sta­gram, where they posed as friends or fol­low­ers of the vic­tims they tar­geted.</p>
    <p>They would then ask vic­tims for their per­sonal de­tails such as mo­bile phone num­bers or their In­ter­net bank­ing ac­count de­tails, claim­ing they would sign the vic­tims up for con­tests or pro­mo­tions on on­line shop­ping plat­forms Lazada or Shopee.</p>
    <p>The vic­tims later dis­cov­ered that unau­tho­rised fraud­u­lent trans­ac­tions – of­ten on on­line plat­forms sell­ing vir­tual cur­rency for on­line games – had been made from their bank ac­counts and mo­bile wal­lets with­out their con­sent.</p>
    <p>The po­lice ad­vised the public to be wary of un­ex­pected re­quests or offers from so­cial me­dia con­tacts, es­pe­cially those re­lated to lucky draws or con­tests: “Ver­ify whether the ac­count is le­git­i­mate by check­ing with your fam­ily and friends off­line.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the public should re­frain from giv­ing out their per­sonal or bank ac­count de­tails and one­time pass­words to any­one, in­clud­ing fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>In most of the cases, the vic­tims were tricked into dis­clos­ing their credit card in­for­ma­tion and one-time pass­words to scam­mers, the po­lice said.</p>
