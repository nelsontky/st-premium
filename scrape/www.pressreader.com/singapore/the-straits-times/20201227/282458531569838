    <p>Gold is no longer the only “safe haven” as­set in a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Judg­ing from the way peo­ple around the world have been snap­ping up prop­erty, it seems that the re­ces­sion has made some in­vestors see real es­tate as an­other safe place to park their money. Af­ter all, this is an in­vest­ment that you can en­joy by liv­ing in it.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, many rich peo­ple in Europe and the US are buy­ing sec­ond homes in the coun­try­side to es­cape the high Covid-19 in­fec­tion rate in the cities.</p>
    <p>But un­like gold, which is more af­ford­able for the av­er­age in­vestors, in­vest­ing in real es­tate means hav­ing deeper pockets be­cause prices have been ris­ing, and not fall­ing, in this re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the rush to buy big­ger re­sale con­do­mini­ums – due to the in­creas­ing num­ber of profession­als who are work­ing from home – has re­sulted in the high­est num­ber of trans­ac­tions per quar­ter in the past two years, with 2,762 units sold in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Close to half of these were big­ger units of over 1,200 sq ft.</p>
    <p>In­vest worked with Ms Chris­tine Sun, the head of re­search and con­sul­tancy of OrangeTee & Tie, and prop­erty an­a­lyst Ong Kah Seng to iden­tify some of the most pop­u­lar re­sale apart­ments in con­do­mini­ums in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The selec­tion was not based on sub­jec­tive pref­er­ence but us­ing sales data as well as price com­par­i­son with sim­i­lar prop­er­ties in the same neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>An apart­ment made the In­vest’s hot re­sale con­do­minium list if it met these cri­te­ria:</p>
    <p>• Pop­u­lar. This means that most</p>
    <p>buyers would know its name and</p>
    <p>Due to the pref­er­ence for new prop­er­ties, many buyers some­times miss good re­sale con­dos in the same neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>be fa­mil­iar with its lo­ca­tion. Not only that, sales at the condo would have been quite high in re­cent months and many ex­ist­ing own­ers are try­ing to sell. Af­ter all, it is point­less to high­light a con­do­minium if none of the own­ers are sell­ing their homes.</p>
    <p>Strong fea­tures. There must be rea­sons why some prop­er­ties are hot­ter than oth­ers – it is be­cause they have at­trac­tive sell­ing points such as fan­tas­tic views or good lo­ca­tions. And they are fairly new and are in good con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Hid­den gems. Due to the pref­er­ence for new prop­er­ties, many buyers some­times miss good re­sale con­dos in the same neigh­bour­hood. This is es­pe­cially so when older units are priced be­low new ones. If the price is sig­nif­i­cantly lower, it in­di­cates that the re­sale prop­erty could be un­der­val­ued and that the price gap presents a good in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity. • Good dis­counts. You can­not de­scribe a prop­erty as a good buy when its price is at an all-time high. So in choos­ing these re­sale prop­er­ties, we also checked if the price had dropped re­cently to de­ter­mine if the dis­counted price was a good en­try point. Good rental po­ten­tial. This fac­tor is very important for those who are plan­ning to buy real es­tate as an in­vest­ment. It is a big plus point if the prop­erty is well-known, which means more prospec­tive ten­ants would ac­tu­ally search the rental list­ing for it.</p>
    <p>Of course, as in all listings, this is not rocket sci­ence – not all units in these projects are good buys if the in­di­vid­ual own­ers’ ask­ing prices are too high or that they have cer­tain dis­ad­van­tages, such as a poor as­pect.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, if your home is not fea­tured here, it does not mean it is not a good in­vest­ment. As the owner, you are en­ti­tled to have the last word on this mat­ter.</p>
