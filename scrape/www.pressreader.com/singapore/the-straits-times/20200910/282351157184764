    <p>LON­DON • Kevin de Bruyne cred­ited the in­flu­ence of Pep Guardi­ola af­ter be­com­ing the first Manch­ester City player to be named the Pro­fes­sional Foot­ballers’ As­so­ci­a­tion’s (PFA) player of the year.</p>
    <p>The rest of the PFA team of the year is dom­i­nated by Premier League cham­pi­ons Liver­pool with five play­ers, while Manch­ester United’s Marcus Rash­ford was handed a merit award for his role in</p>
    <p>fight­ing against child poverty.</p>
    <p>City won the league four times in the past eight sea­sons but none of their stars claimed the pres­ti­gious in­di­vid­ual ac­co­lade. But af­ter a cam­paign dom­i­nated by Liver­pool, de Bruyne, who reg­is­tered 13 goals and a record-equalling 20 as­sists, was voted the cam­paign’s top per­former by his peers.</p>
    <p>“This is a big hon­our, to be voted by your col­leagues, com­peti­tors from other teams who you al­ways play against on the field. That they vote for you for best player, it’s amaz­ing,” said the 29-year-old.</p>
    <p>“It’s maybe strange that I’m the first one at City, see­ing all the good play­ers who played there be­fore and who are still play­ing. But it’s nice to rep­re­sent the club.”</p>
    <p>The Bel­gium mid­fielder praised Guardi­ola’s in­flu­ence for giv­ing him the free­dom to shine.</p>
    <p>“We speak of­ten about the team but in a lot of senses he knows when he gives the or­ders of what the team has to do that I will listen,” he added. “But then on the other side he gives me a lot of free­dom... He knows in one way I will al­ways put the team first and then ob­vi­ously if I can help my­self I’m go­ing to do that.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool’s were rep­re­sented in the team of the year by Jor­dan Hen­der­son, Trent Alexan­der-Arnold, Andy Robert­son, Vir­gil van Dijk and Sa­dio Mane.</p>
    <p>Burn­ley’s goal­keeper Nick Pope, Le­ices­ter de­fender Caglar Soyuncu, David Silva, who left City af­ter 10 sea­sons at the Eti­had, golden boot win­ner Jamie Vardy and Arse­nal’s Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang were also se­lected.</p>
