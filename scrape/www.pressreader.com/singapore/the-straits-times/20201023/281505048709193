    <p>BANGKOK • Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha yes­ter­day re­voked an emer­gency de­cree aimed at quelling pro-democ­racy protests after the au­thor­i­ties failed to stamp out daily ral­lies de­mand­ing his res­ig­na­tion and re­form of the unas­sail­able monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The Royal Gazette, the govern­ment mouth­piece, re­ported that the emer­gency mea­sures were lifted at 12pm, lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>“All con­di­tions set un­der the se­vere state of emer­gency have been stopped,” it said.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s stu­dent-led prodemoc­racy move­ment has been gain­ing mo­men­tum since mid-July, with mostly young de­mon­stra­tors call­ing for Mr Prayut’s re­moval and a rewrit­ing of the 2017 mil­i­tary-scripted Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Some protest lead­ers have also is­sued con­tro­ver­sial de­mands to re­form the ul­tra-pow­er­ful and wealthy monar­chy, whose in­flu­ence per­me­ates ev­ery as­pect of Thai so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The “se­vere” emer­gency mea­sures were im­posed last week after pro­test­ers flashed a three-fin­ger salute at a royal mo­tor­cade – an un­prece­dented chal­lenge to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ban­ning gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple, the mea­sures gave the po­lice carte blanche to ar­rest pro­test­ers and seize elec­tronic ma­te­ri­als be­lieved to threaten na­tional se­cu­rity – a move that has drawn wide­spread public con­dem­na­tion.</p>
    <p>But the ban failed to dis­cour­age the tens of thou­sands who have amassed daily around ma­jor Bangkok in­ter­sec­tions to call for Mr Prayut to step down.</p>
    <p>The for­mer mil­i­tary chief – who mas­ter­minded the 2014 coup and has held on to power since – had in­di­cated late on Wed­nes­day that he was pre­par­ing to lift the state of se­vere emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut said in a tele­vised ad­dress on Wed­nes­day night that the coun­try must “step back from the edge of the slip­pery slope that can eas­ily slide to chaos”.</p>
    <p>“I will make the first move to deesca­late this sit­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>But the anti-govern­ment pro­test­ers ap­peared to re­ject the olive branch that the Premier was of­fer­ing, giv­ing him three days to re­sign and meet other key de­mands in­clud­ing re­form­ing the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of de­mon­stra­tors on Wed­nes­day night broke through po­lice bar­ri­cades and barbed wire to march to­wards his of­fi­cial of­fice, and gath­ered near the build­ing, known as Govern­ment House.</p>
    <p>“We sub­mit­ted the let­ter for Prayut to re­sign, which is one of our three de­mands,” Free Youth, one of the main protest or­gan­i­sa­tions, said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>“If the govern­ment doesn’t give an an­swer within three days, the peo­ple will re­turn with higher de­mands than be­fore.”</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has strug­gled to stem the mount­ing street de­mon­stra­tions, which have used Hong Kongstyle pop-up ral­lies to avoid po­lice and defy the emer­gency de­cree.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has shown no signs of meet­ing the pro­test­ers’ de­mands, which would up­end the roy­al­ist elite that has main­tained power through­out much of Thai­land’s his­tory, but it has also sought to avoid blood­shed that could fur­ther roil the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The de­mon­stra­tions, too, show no signs of let­ting up, and have even started to spread to other parts of Thai­land.</p>
    <p>They have bro­ken long-held taboos about pub­licly crit­i­cis­ing the royal fam­ily, with de­mands for the monarch to no longer en­dorse coups, pro­vide trans­parency in how funds are spent, and get rid of laws that sti­fle dis­cus­sion of the royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Si­mul­ta­ne­ous ral­lies by pro-roy­al­ist groups in sup­port of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn also raised fears of clashes be­tween the ri­val groups. Past protest move­ments in Thai­land have ended in bloody crack­downs, most re­cently in 2010.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has seen more than a dozen coups since the end of royal ab­so­lutism in 1932, the lat­est in 2014. Its arch-roy­al­ist army, which po­si­tions it­self as a pro­tec­tor of the monar­chy, claims that such in­ter­ven­tions are nec­es­sary to pro­tect the king.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment – which is in re­cess – has been re­called for a spe­cial ses­sion next Mon­day in a bid to re­solve the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut urged the pro­test­ers to trust the par­lia­men­tary process to ad­dress their griev­ances and said the govern­ment and the ac­tivists should “each take a step back” and “find so­lu­tions to the prob­lems”.</p>
    <p>“The only sure way to achieve a sus­tain­able, en­dur­ing res­o­lu­tion to the prob­lems is to speak to each other, re­spect the due process of law, and then let the will of the peo­ple be re­solved in Par­lia­ment,” he said. “That is the only way.”</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s protests are un­der­pinned by years of slug­gish growth now ex­ac­er­bated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has put the Thai econ­omy on course for its worst per­for­mance ever by de­rail­ing the two main driv­ers: tourism and trade.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s bench­mark SET In­dex of stocks has dropped 23 per cent this year. “While the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion has so far been un­der con­trol, the lin­ger­ing protests do not bode well for the Thai eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” said Mr Tim Lee­la­haphan, an econ­o­mist at Stan­dard Char­tered Bank in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>TRUST THE PAR­LIA­MEN­TARY PROCESS The only sure way to achieve a sus­tain­able, en­dur­ing res­o­lu­tion to the prob­lems is to speak to each other, re­spect the due process of law, and then let the will of the peo­ple be re­solved in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER PRAYUT CHAN-O-CHA STAND­ING THEIR GROUND We sub­mit­ted the let­ter for Prayut to re­sign, which is one of our three de­mands. If the govern­ment doesn’t give an an­swer within three days, the peo­ple will re­turn with higher de­mands than be­fore.
