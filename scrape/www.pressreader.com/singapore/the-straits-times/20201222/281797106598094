    <p>• Euro­pean Union gov­ern­ments yes­ter­day called on the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion to ur­gently draw up guide­lines to co­or­di­nate the bloc’s ap­proach to travel re­stric­tions on Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of coun­tries closed their bor­ders to Bri­tain yes­ter­day over fears of a highly in­fec­tious new coro­n­avirus strain, caus­ing travel chaos. Within the 27-mem­ber Euro­pean Union, those mea­sures in­clude a 24-hour travel ban in Bel­gium, an­other one ex­tend­ing to Jan 1 in the Nether­lands, and a ban on goods ve­hi­cles in France.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the EU mem­ber states con­vened for a video­con­fer­ence yes­ter­day and sup­ported the idea of a co­or­di­nated EU ap­proach, an EU diplo­mat said. They sub­se­quently asked the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion to come up with com­mon guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The EU mem­bers also stressed the im­por­tance of keep­ing bor­ders open within the Schen­gen Area, the group of 26 coun­tries which have abol­ished con­trols on bor­ders with one an­other.</p>
    <p>“An­other im­por­tant is­sue for mem­ber states is the ques­tion of repa­tri­at­ing cit­i­zens and le­gal res­i­dents wish­ing to re­turn from the UK,” the diplo­mat said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has called on its mem­bers in Europe to step up mea­sures against the coro­n­avirus in the face of the new vari­ant cir­cu­lat­ing in Bri­tain, its Euro­pean branch said.</p>
    <p>“Across Europe, where trans­mis­sion is in­tense and wide­spread, coun­tries need to re­dou­ble their con­trol and pre­ven­tion ap­proaches,” a spokesman for WHO Europe told Agence France-Presse on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions agency urged its mem­bers world­wide to “in­crease the se­quenc­ing of SarsCoV-2 viruses where pos­si­ble and shar­ing of se­quence data in­ter­na­tion­ally, in par­tic­u­lar, to re­port if the same mu­ta­tions of con­cern are found”, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The WHO noted “pre­lim­i­nary signs that the vari­ant may be able to spread more eas­ily be­tween peo­ple” and “pre­lim­i­nary in­for­ma­tion that the vari­ant may af­fect (the) per­for­mance of some di­ag­nos­tic (tests)”. It said it had “no ev­i­dence to in­di­cate any change in dis­ease sever­ity, but this is also un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion”.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish vari­ant has about 20 mu­ta­tions, in­clud­ing sev­eral that af­fect how the virus locks onto hu­man cells and in­fects them. Th­ese mu­ta­tions may al­low the vari­ant to repli­cate and trans­mit more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish of­fi­cials have said that the vari­ant was as much as 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble.</p>
