    <p>Mid-ca­reer work­ers can soon sign up for more than 10 new cour­ses that will help pre­pare them to take up jobs in the built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The cour­ses on of­fer are in ar­eas such as con­struc­tion and fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment, se­cu­rity and en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>About 900 places are grad­u­ally open­ing from this month for those who wish to sign up for the cour­ses, Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore (SSG) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cour­ses are be­ing rolled out as part of the SGUnited Skills Pro­gramme – a full-time train­ing ini­tia­tive last­ing be­tween six and 12 months, and which is tai­lored for those who want to up­grade their skills while look­ing for a new job.</p>
    <p>Train­ing providers, such as the BCA Academy, In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion, Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, are lend­ing their sup­port to help make th­ese train­ing places avail­able, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>SSG chief ex­ec­u­tive Ong Tze Ch’in, speak­ing to re­porters at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic yes­ter­day, said there are dif­fer­ent types of cour­ses cov­er­ing sev­eral other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“We are closely watch­ing demand and in­ter­est from job seek­ers, and we are pre­pared to ad­just as re­quired, de­pend­ing on where the in­ter­est is, and where the skill sets of those who are join­ing us are,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, dur­ing a visit to Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, ob­served how a class for one of the new cour­ses was con­ducted.</p>
    <p>He saw how trainees tak­ing the spe­cial­ist diploma in build­ing in­for­ma­tion mod­el­ling (BIM) man­age­ment were taught to use a com­puter pro­gramme to de­sign a build­ing vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>SSG said it is work­ing with train­ing providers and in­dus­try lead­ers to en­sure the cour­ses are de­signed to equip trainees with in-demand skills that com­pa­nies are look­ing for now.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial­ist diploma in BIM man­age­ment is a 12-month course that costs $1,000 – and trainees can use their Skill­sFu­ture cred­its to off­set the fee.</p>
    <p>As part of the ini­tia­tive, SSG and Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic also have a tie-up with real es­tate gi­ant Cap­i­taLand and in­fra­struc­ture firm CPG Cor­po­ra­tion to pre­pare trainees for job op­por­tu­ni­ties in dig­i­tal de­sign, project man­age­ment and smart fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand and CPG Cor­po­ra­tion also plan to snap up new hires from the pool of trainees once they have com­pleted the course.</p>
    <p>Ms Vi­o­let Chew, 45, who used to draw up elec­tri­cal plans in her pre­vi­ous job as an elec­tri­cal drafter, was among those at­tend­ing the BIM man­age­ment class yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She said she was re­trenched in June and has found it dif­fi­cult to get an­other job in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“I de­cided to take up this course to en­hance my skills and open up more op­tions for my­self, apart from be­ing a drafter,” she said.</p>
    <p>“This course will help en­hance my knowl­edge, es­pe­cially in the area of man­age­ment and co­or­di­na­tion, as well as tech­ni­cal skills.”</p>
    <p>Since the launch of the SGUnited Skills Pro­gramme last month, more than 10,000 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties have been rolled out, and nearly 700 trainees have en­rolled in 40 cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong of SSG said: “The SGUnited Skills Pro­gramme was de­signed for mid-ca­reer work­ers, and I’m heart­ened to see that more than 50 per cent of the en­rol­ments are for per­sons aged 40 and above. So, I think that’s a sign of good progress.”</p>
    <p>He added that nearly 10,000 more ap­pli­ca­tions are still be­ing pro­cessed for cour­ses that have yet to start. “We will do our very best to meet mar­ket demand,” he said.</p>
    <p>Other in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing have al­ready started of­fer­ing cour­ses in other sec­tors as part of the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Uni­ver­sity last month an­nounced cour­ses in busi­ness and en­vi­ron­men­tal sustainabi­lity, in­no­va­tion and dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
