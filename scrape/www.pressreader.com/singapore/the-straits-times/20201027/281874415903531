    <p>WASH­ING­TON Early vot­ing in the US elec­tion has sur­passed all the pre-elec­tion bal­lots from four years ear­lier, an in­de­pen­dent vote mon­i­tor has said ahead of the Nov 3 poll.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of Amer­i­cans wary of crowded polling booths dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic and en­er­gised by an elec­tion fight that both Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den have framed as ex­is­ten­tial are smash­ing records for cast­ing their bal­lots, whether by mail or in per­son.</p>
    <p>The tally by the in­de­pen­dent US Elec­tions Project, run by the Univer­sity of Florida, said that more than 59 mil­lion peo­ple had voted as of Sun­day. That is higher than the 57 mil­lion who voted early or by mail in the 2016 polls, ac­cord­ing to the US Elec­tion As­sis­tance Com­mis­sion web­site.</p>
    <p>So far, Democrats – who have en­cour­aged early vot­ing – have been lead­ing the way, but whether that means Mr Bi­den can breathe easy re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has, for months, been claim­ing with­out ev­i­dence that mail-in bal­lots lead to fraud, and many Re­pub­li­cans are ex­pected to vote on polling day it­self on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>With coron­avirus cases spik­ing across the coun­try, how­ever, Pro­fes­sor Michael McDon­ald – a po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Florida who ad­min­is­ters the Elec­tions Project – warned that the strat­egy “looks all the more risky”.</p>
    <p>“What if at least some of his vot­ers de­cide not to vote? What if a polling place be­comes un­avail­able or an elec­tion of­fice shuts down?” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>The Elec­tions Project has pre­dicted that turnout this year could top 150 mil­lion in to­tal. Some 137 mil­lion bal­lots were cast in the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Some states key to the 2020 out­come were also firmly on the path to break­ing records, such as Texas, where the Elec­tion Project said on Sun­day that 80 per cent of the early 2016 vote had al­ready turned out.</p>
    <p>“Folks, Texas still has in-per­son early vot­ing un­til Fri­day, plus elec­tion day. No doubt Texas turnout will be above 2016. Ques­tion is, how much?” Prof McDon­ald tweeted.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion in Texas, tra­di­tion­ally a con­ser­va­tive bas­tion which has backed Re­pub­li­can can­di­dates since 1980, is un­der close scrutiny, with some polls show­ing Mr Bi­den in a po­si­tion to edge out Mr Trump.</p>
