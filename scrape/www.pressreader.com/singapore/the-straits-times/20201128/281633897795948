    <p>Of the four new cases, one is a Sin­ga­porean, two are per­ma­nent res­i­dents and one is a work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean is a 53year-old woman who re­turned from India.</p>
    <p>The two per­ma­nent res­i­dents are a 44-year-old woman who re­turned from India and a 42-year-old man who re­turned from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The work per­mit holder had ar­rived here from India and re­ported the on­set of Covid-19 symp­toms on Nov 16.</p>
    <p>The three other cases had been asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>No new lo­ca­tions were added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients when they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one case in the past week.</p>
    <p>With seven cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,096 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>

    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Of the four new cases, one is a Sin­ga­porean, two are per­ma­nent res­i­dents and one is a work per­mit holder. The Sin­ga­porean is a 53-year-old woman who re­turned from India.
