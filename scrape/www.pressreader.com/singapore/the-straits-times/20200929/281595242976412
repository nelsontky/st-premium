    <p>Be­yond Mu­lan’s many cul­tural cross­over mistakes, Amer­i­can film-mak­ers face a larger prob­lem of chang­ing Chi­nese tastes and be­ing caught up in Sino-US ten­sions, says China bureau chief Tan Dawn Wei (be­low).</p>
    <p>“Your chi is strong, Mu­lan. But chi is for war­riors, not daugh­ters. Soon, you’ll be a young woman and it is time for you to hide your gift away,” Hua Zhou tells his tomboy­ish daugh­ter, who has a knack for jump­ing across rooftops, fly­ing down build­ings and chas­ing chick­ens.</p>
    <p>Wait a sec­ond. Chi is for war­riors? Says who?</p>
    <p>Says the Amer­i­can hus­band-and-wife script-writ­ing team of Rick Jaffa and Amanda Sil­ver, hired to turn this beloved age-old Chi­nese leg­end, of a young woman who takes her fa­ther’s place in an army con­scrip­tion ex­er­cise and goes to war pre­tend­ing to be a man, into a block­buster.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney scored a hit with the an­i­mated ver­sion of this fa­mous folk­lore in 1998, gross­ing US$300 mil­lion world­wide. But this time, it is re­mak­ing Mu­lan with a spe­cific au­di­ence in mind: the hun­dreds of mil­lions of Chi­nese movie­go­ers from An­hui to Zhe­jiang.</p>
    <p>The stu­dio splashed out US$200 mil­lion (S$275 mil­lion) and spent five years putting it to­gether af­ter seek­ing ad­vice from Chi­nese con­sul­tants, sub­mit­ting the script to the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties, and cast­ing pop­u­lar main­land ac­tors such as Liu Yifei, Gong Li and Jet Li in lead roles.</p>
    <p>This live-ac­tion retelling of the story of one of the na­tion’s great­est hero­ines was sup­posed to be Dis­ney’s ticket this year to the Chi­nese box of­fice, the fastest-grow­ing mar­ket in the world with US$9.2 bil­lion in re­ceipts last year and poised to sur­pass the United States to be­come No. 1 soon.</p>
    <p>“If Mu­lan doesn’t work in China, we have a prob­lem,” co-chair­man of Walt Dis­ney Stu­dios Alan Horn said last year.</p>
    <p>But since the film’s open­ing in China more than two weeks ago, movie­go­ers in China have flamed it for its em­bar­rass­ing cul­tural mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion and wit­less artis­tic lib­er­ties, baf­fled as to how Hol­ly­wood is try­ing to sell them an ex­oti­cised Chi­nese tale seen through West­ern lens.</p>
    <p>Like this cu­ri­ous con­cept in the movie that the scriptwrit­ers call “chi”, which is the rea­son that hero­ine Hua Mu­lan is able to leap over rooftops and “light-foot” across walls, and that she as a woman has to sup­press.</p>
    <p>Don’t, for a minute, con­fuse it with qi, the vi­tal en­ergy and life force that the Chi­nese be­lieve is in all of us, be­cause that doesn’t seem to be the scriptwrit­ers’ un­der­stand­ing of this an­cient prin­ci­ple.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t feel the ‘ qi’ de­scribed in the movie, but I did feel ‘ qi’ (also ‘an­gry’ in Chi­nese) af­ter watch­ing the movie,” said one Chi­nese blog­ger.</p>
    <p>Movie­go­ers were quick to point out other cul­tural and his­tor­i­cal trans­gres­sions, like how Mu­lan in the movie lived in a Fu­jian tu­lou – Hakka earthen build­ings from the 12th cen­tury – when she was sup­posed to have been a war­rior in the north­ern and south­ern dy­nas­ties era 600 years ear­lier.</p>
    <p>An­other movie blog­ger even joked that the West­ern pro­duc­tion de­sign­ers painted what looked like the Huawei logo – red petals – on Liu’s fore­head in one scene where the ac­tress play­ing Mu­lan was dolled up to meet a match­maker.</p>
    <p>“Tu­lou, hanfu (tra­di­tional cloth­ing of the Han Chi­nese), an­cient ar­mour, mar­tial arts; ori­en­tal el­e­ments in the eyes of West­ern­ers – throw them all in. Don’t care if they’re right. Just shoot the movie first,” said the blog­ger.</p>
    <p>In­flu­en­tial re­view site Douban’s score for the movie was a dis­mal 4.9 out of 10, amal­ga­mated from over 200,000 users, with many call­ing the film “a joke”.</p>
    <p>“Mu­lan is our hero, not Dis­ney’s play­thing,” fumed poster Zhang Hongqiu on pop­u­lar mi­croblog Weibo.</p>
    <p>If Dis­ney was in­deed tar­get­ing the Chi­nese au­di­ence with Mu­lan, it de­fies logic that the stu­dio would choose an all-West­ern di­rect­ing, writ­ing and de­sign­ing team with no</p>
    <p>Asian cre­atives to give it the rel­e­vant cul­tural treat­ment it de­serves.</p>
    <p>“These films with Chi­nese el­e­ments never did well in the past, with the ex­cep­tion of Kung Fu Panda,” said Dr Chin Yik Chan, a lec­turer in me­dia and com­mu­ni­ca­tion stud­ies at the Xi’an Jiao­tong-Liver­pool Univer­sity in Suzhou.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese au­di­ence want re­spect, they want to keep to the orig­i­nal­ity of a his­tor­i­cal fig­ure’s story. Dis­ney needs to think care­fully in the fu­ture about the au­di­ence’s af­fec­tion for such fa­mous fig­ures.”</p>
    <p>Even be­fore Mu­lan came un­der fire for its thought­less cul­tural in­ter­pre­ta­tions, Dis­ney had faced po­lit­i­cal back­lash for film­ing part of the movie in Xin­jiang, where ac­tivists and for­eign gov­ern­ments have ac­cused China of hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions against its Mus­lim pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>A call to boy­cott the movie en­sued, also driven by com­ments Mu­lan star Liu made in Au­gust last year on Weibo pub­licly sup­port­ing the Hong Kong po­lice in quelling the months-long protests in the city.</p>
    <p>US law­mak­ers also de­manded to know about Dis­ney’s col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Xin­jiang au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>As Amer­i­can stu­dios con­tinue to si­dle up to China for a piece of the huge do­mes­tic pie, they will find them­selves hav­ing to ap­pease mul­ti­ple par­ties – the Chi­nese cen­sors, US politi­cians, ac­tivists, his­to­ri­ans and an in­creas­ingly dis­cern­ing Chi­nese au­di­ence whose grow­ing ap­pre­ci­a­tion for pro­gres­sively slick home-grown pro­duc­tions has been matched by a shrink­ing ap­petite for West­ern fare.</p>
    <p>QUOTA SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>Im­ported films are sub­jected to a quota in China, with only 34 films a year mak­ing it into the cin­e­mas. Pro­duc­ers also get just a 25 per cent cut from Chi­nese ticket sales, while im­ported films typ­i­cally ac­count for 40 per cent of the box of­fice.</p>
    <p>Stu­dios have been push­ing for greater ac­cess and a larger share of the box of­fice, but ne­go­ti­a­tions had ap­par­ently stalled, side­lined by the trade war.</p>
    <p>Last year, only two Hol­ly­wood flicks made it into China’s 10 top-gross­ing films of the year – Avengers: Endgame in third place, and Fast And Fu­ri­ous Presents: Hobbs And Shaw at No. 10.</p>
    <p>An­other in­di­ca­tion that the Chi­nese are pre­fer­ring their own movies to the im­ports: Nine out of China’s top 10 big­gest-sell­ing films of all time are home-grown, in­clud­ing at least three that were re­leased last year.</p>
    <p>What­ever the film au­di­ence’s taste, China’s im­mense mar­ket con­tin­ues to grow, with box of­fice tak­ings ris­ing 5.4 per cent last year and 1.7 bil­lion tick­ets sold, ac­cord­ing to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party pa­per, Peo­ple’s Daily.</p>
    <p>No sur­prise then that Tin­sel­town con­tin­ues to pan­der to Bei­jing for ac­cess to this lu­cra­tive mar­ket.</p>
    <p>A lengthy re­port by non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion PEN Amer­ica last month de­tailed how Bei­jing’s grow­ing clout in the world has shaped the way movies are made by Amer­i­can pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>“As US film stu­dios com­pete for the op­por­tu­nity to ac­cess Chi­nese au­di­ences, many are mak­ing dif­fi­cult and trou­bling com­pro­mises on free ex­pres­sion: chang­ing the con­tent of films in­tended for in­ter­na­tional – in­clud­ing Amer­i­can – au­di­ences; en­gag­ing in self-cen­sor­ship; agree­ing to pro­vide a cen­sored ver­sion of a movie for screen­ing in China; and in some in­stances, di­rectly invit­ing Chi­nese gov­ern­ment cen­sors onto their film sets to ad­vise them on how to avoid trip­ping the cen­sors’ wires,” said the re­port.</p>
    <p>“These con­ces­sions to the power of the Chi­nese mar­ket have hap­pened mostly qui­etly, with lit­tle at­ten­tion and, of­ten, lit­tle de­bate. Steadily, a new set of mores has taken hold in Hol­ly­wood, one in which ap­peas­ing Chi­nese gov­ern­ment in­vestors and gate­keep­ers has sim­ply be­come a way of do­ing busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>That Chi­nese cen­sors have de­manded that scenes be chopped hardly raises any eye­brows. Other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, sub­ject im­ported films to the same regime. Same-sex kiss­ing scenes, for in­stance, have gone miss­ing from Star Trek Be­yond, Alien: Covenant and Bo­hemian Rhap­sody on Chi­nese big screens.</p>
    <p>But the re­port has found a preva­lence of self-cen­sor­ship among the stu­dios that it says is far more trou­bling, such as when Mar­vel Stu­dios rewrote a ma­jor Ti­betan char­ac­ter in its 2016 movie, Dr Strange, into a Celtic one, for fear of scup­per­ing the movie’s chances in China.</p>
    <p>The re­port high­lighted an­other more re­cent ex­am­ple – the an­tic­i­pated se­quel to Top Gun, now sched­uled for a 2021 re­lease.</p>
    <p>Fans, af­ter watch­ing the movie trailer last year, pointed out that Tom Cruise’s iconic leather bomber jacket sport­ing a Ja­panese flag and a Tai­wanese one in the orig­i­nal 1986 movie, has now been changed to one with in­dis­tin­guish­able flags.</p>
    <p>The stu­dio, Paramount, which part­nered Chi­nese tech gi­ant Ten­cent to mar­ket and dis­trib­ute the film, did not com­ment.</p>
    <p>If Chi­nese pro­pa­gan­dists have thus far been un­suc­cess­ful in car­ry­ing out the or­ders of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to “tell the China story well” by ad­vanc­ing its soft power, Hol­ly­wood – the great­est sto­ry­teller in the world – is do­ing their job for them.</p>
    <p>Swop out the Chi­nese vil­lain for a Rus­sian one. Cast house­hold names like Fan Bing­bing, Li Bing­bing, Jing Tian in big pro­duc­tions, even though they can barely speak in­tel­li­gi­ble English. Por­tray the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment in a good light, bet­ter yet if it helps to save the world.</p>
    <p>THE EIGHT HUN­DRED</p>
    <p>As Mu­lan lan­guished at the Chi­nese box of­fice, an­other movie re­leased just weeks be­fore has been draw­ing Chi­nese movie­go­ers back to the the­atres in droves, be­com­ing the No.1 gross­ing film world­wide this year.</p>
    <p>The Eight Hun­dred, a his­tor­i­cal war epic about a group of Chi­nese soldiers who de­fended a Shang­hai ware­house com­plex against the Ja­panese in 1937, is the lat­est in a slew of pa­tri­otic films that have en­rap­tured Chi­nese au­di­ences in re­cent years with their high pro­duc­tion val­ues and na­tion­al­is­tic themes.</p>
    <p>In the 39 days since its re­lease, it has al­ready earned 3 bil­lion yuan (S$605 mil­lion) at the Chi­nese box of­fice, trump­ing the 273 mil­lion yuan in tak­ings for Mu­lan over 18 days.</p>
    <p>Wolf War­rior 2, a 2017 film about a Chi­nese sol­dier who goes on special mis­sions around the world, holds the record as the high­est-gross­ing movie of all time in China.</p>
    <p>The Wan­der­ing Earth, re­leased last year and the third best-sell­ing film in Chi­nese his­tory, is a sci-fi block­buster about a group of Chi­nese as­tro­nauts and res­cue work­ers who help move Earth away from an ex­pand­ing Sun.</p>
    <p>“Pa­tri­otic films haven’t al­ways been suc­cess­ful, but they have be­come more so­phis­ti­cated in their pro­duc­tion. The ac­tion scenes are in­tense and the visual im­ages are strong. There’s more fo­cus on mak­ing them en­ter­tain­ing,” said Dr Chin. “And be­cause of the re­cent ten­sions be­tween China and the West­ern world, Chi­nese pa­tri­otic sen­ti­ments seem to have grown, which could ex­plain why The Eight Hun­dred and The Wan­der­ing Earth have been so suc­cess­ful.”</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood is up against this turn­ing tide, and reimag­in­ing an­cient tales of leg­endary he­roes that are not its own is not the solution.</p>
    <p>If it wants a piece of this Chi­nese pie, Tin­sel­town needs to save its chi for what it does best – big, loud, ac­tion block­busters that pro­vide a sen­sory over­load, or quaint, heart­strings-tug­ging an­i­mated movies with uni­ver­sal ap­peal, both of which the Chi­nese film in­dus­try has yet to mas­ter.</p>
