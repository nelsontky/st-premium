    <p>A range of hous­ing types will be built in up­com­ing es­tates in prime lo­ca­tions such as the Greater South­ern Wa­ter­front (GSW) to en­sure that all pub­lic hous­ing es­tates will have a good mix of Sin­ga­pore­ans, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude smaller hous­ing types such as two-room flats for se­niors and rental hous­ing for low-in­come fam­i­lies, de­pend­ing on the plan­ning pa­ram­e­ters and the needs of dif­fer­ent hous­ing types, but are “de­lib­er­ately in­jected”, he said in an in­ter­view with Lianhe Zaobao.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee ac­knowl­edged the “lot­tery ef­fect” of th­ese well-lo­cated Hous­ing Board flats, which could re­sult in a “likely wind­fall” for home own­ers who sell th­ese gov­ern­ment-sub­sidised Build-To-Or­der flats on the re­sale mar­ket.</p>
    <p>There is the is­sue of “in­clu­sive­ness and di­ver­sity” when th­ese flats are al­lowed to be resold af­ter the five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod, he said. “If it is go­ing to be sold and trans­acted at high re­sale prices, then there is a risk that only well-off Sin­ga­pore­ans can buy (flats in) those es­tates. And then, of course, the char­ac­ter of the es­tates will change and it may be priced be­yond the reach of or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We do not want to have es­tates that are gen­tri­fied and that only the wealthy can af­ford to live (in). We want to have a good mix.”</p>
    <p>To achieve that, be­sides in­tro­duc­ing di­verse hous­ing, Mr Lee noted that flat prices must be kept af­ford­able for the first sale by HDB, and also in sub­se­quent re­sales.</p>
    <p>“We may need a se­ries of other mea­sures to en­sure that if re­sale is per­mit­ted for th­ese flats, that they re­main af­ford­able for gen­er­a­tions to come,” he said, with­out spec­i­fy­ing the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple will of course pay what they be­lieve the mar­ket can bear in or­der to get th­ese very good flats and very good lo­ca­tions. So, some of th­ese mea­sures would have to cover all th­ese fronts,” he added.</p>
    <p>He cited the GSW as one ex­am­ple of a prime site, but noted that in terms of timeline, it is “quite far down the line”. “But there may be other sites with very prime at­tributes that might be rolled out in the months and years ahead.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said HDB will seek pub­lic sug­ges­tions and feed­back through en­gage­ment ses­sions over the next few months. “We will want to make sure that th­ese pub­lic dis­cus­sions are held, peo­ple’s views are ob­tained, and then we can come up with a model that we could po­ten­tially ap­ply in the near term.”</p>
    <p>First an­nounced in 2013, the GSW com­prises 30km of coast­line stretch­ing from the Gar­dens by the Bay East area to Pasir Pan­jang.</p>
    <p>The 2,000ha mega wa­ter­front de­vel­op­ment – six times the size of Ma­rina Bay and twice the size of Pung­gol – was sketched out by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong in his 2019 Na­tional Day Rally speech.</p>
    <p>About 9,000 pri­vate and pub­lic hous­ing units will be built on the site of Kep­pel Golf Club as part of the fu­ture GSW, with fu­ture hous­ing avail­able on other sites too.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter said that even as the HDB is con­stantly re­view­ing and evolv­ing pub­lic hous­ing poli­cies to be re­spon­sive to Sin­ga­pore­ans’ chang­ing de­mo­graph­ics and as­pi­ra­tions, core val­ues re­main.</p>
    <p>“We want to keep the char­ac­ter of all our HDB es­tates in­clu­sive and di­verse, and to en­able Sin­ga­pore­ans, or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans, to also be able to live in parts of Sin­ga­pore that one will con­sider as prime,” he said.</p>
