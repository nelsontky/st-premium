    <p>RACE 1 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>2 Hay Run steps back to the turf which should spark sharp im­prove­ment. He should have ben­e­fited from his first-up ef­fort on the dirt. 10 Art Of Raw is at a com­pet­i­tive mark in Class 5. He kicked on well for third last start. From the good gate, he should re­ceive a good run.</p>
    <p>3 Joy Master gets a handy 10lb (4.54kg) claim from ap­pren­tice jockey Jerry Chau. He de­serves re­spect.</p>
    <p>7 Great Smart is solid. He should run a bold race over his pre­ferred course and dis­tance.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>10 Di­a­mond Pe­ga­sus should be fit­ter af­ter his first-up run. He should take some catch­ing from the front. 4 Jade Phoenix has the runs on the board. He should get the run of the race un­der “Magic Man” Joao Mor­eira from Gate 3.</p>
    <p>6 My Sugar grabbed fourth on de­but last sea­son. Cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton hops up off the back of any eye-catch­ing trial.</p>
    <p>2 Eligere can fin­ish around the mark again.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>5 So Awe­some turned in an im­pres­sive first-up third. He should ben­e­fit from the ex­tra 200m.</p>
    <p>1 Ul­ti­mate Glory is racing well in Class 4. With race ex­pe­ri­ence on his side, he should fin­ish around the mark.</p>
    <p>9 All For St Paul’s has abil­ity. His is­sue is the awk­ward gate, which could see him do a fair bit of work early.</p>
    <p>8 Win­win Thir­tythree is look­ing for back-to-back wins, even with the step-up from Class 5 to Class 4.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>5 Yes We Can found form at the end of last sea­son. If he can re­cap­ture that form, he is ca­pa­ble of bag­ging a first Hong Kong win.</p>
    <p>6 Master Gal­axy ran sec­ond firstup. He is ca­pa­ble of go­ing one bet­ter off that run. In his favour is the book­ing of Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>4 Vi­tal Spring has drawn a touch awk­wardly. But he can take an­other step for­ward for jockey Vin­cent Ho and trainer Fran­cis Lui.</p>
    <p>14 E Gen­er­a­tion is next best with no weight on his back.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>6 Give Way Please shot clear in a re­cent trial, dis­play­ing im­mense tal­ent. If he can re­pro­duce that on race day, he is the one to beat.</p>
    <p>3 United We Stand loves the course and dis­tance. With Chau’s 10lb claim, he has ev­ery chance.</p>
    <p>11 Goko can fig­ure as a four-time course-and-dis­tance win­ner. He is down to a com­pet­i­tive mark.</p>
    <p>13 Manna From Heaven has shown lit­tle but can im­prove from his first-up ef­fort at the Val­ley.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>5 Clear Choice loves the course and dis­tance. From Gate 5, he should get the run of the race and score.</p>
    <p>6 The Hulk races on the dirt for the first time. He has tri­alled im­pres­sively on the sur­face pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>4 En­fold­ing’s race pat­tern might see him at the back. But, with a strong pace, he can rat­tle home.</p>
    <p>8 Best Al­liance will also be well back and fin­ish strongly for some money.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,650M)</p>
    <p>6 King’s Race can roll for­ward with Skyey Supreme draw­ing wide. From there, he can take some run­ning down.</p>
    <p>12 Crown Av­enue gets the ser­vices of Pur­ton. Down in the weights, he maps to get the gun run from the good gate.</p>
    <p>2 Skyey Supreme has to do some work to cross in from the wide gate. He is also car­ry­ing 133lb which could see him strug­gle a bit.</p>
    <p>1 Party Ev­ery­day missed the kick last start, but still man­aged to rat­tle into sec­ond. Ex­pect a sim­i­lar run.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>11 Leap Of Faith rat­tled home last start for an im­pres­sive win. He can take an­other step for­ward, es­pe­cially with no weight on his back.</p>
    <p>8 Toy­coon has strug­gled but seems to have abil­ity. If he can piece it all to­gether, he is a lively chance.</p>
    <p>6 Al­cari is in the mix. Given the op­por­tu­nity, he is ca­pa­ble of test­ing these.</p>
    <p>2 Beauty Spirit is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>11 Prince Of Gems is look­ing for back-to-back wins, af­ter scor­ing at the sea­son’s open­ing fix­ture. He has trained on and is even ca­pa­ble of tak­ing this Class 3 con­test.</p>
    <p>10 Fab­u­lous Eight has also won his only race this sea­son. He should get ev­ery chance up on the pace.</p>
    <p>6 Cruis­ing is slowly re­cap­tur­ing his best. With Pur­ton up, he de­serves re­spect.</p>
    <p>2 Valiant Dream is noth­ing short of con­sis­tent. He would not be too far away again.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>6 Ex­cel­lent Pro­posal has gone from strength to strength. He looks to be on an up­ward tra­jec­tory to­wards the 2021 Four-Year-Old Clas­sic Se­ries. He should take plenty of beat­ing.</p>
    <p>7 En­rich­ment has abil­ity. Although he does not have the wins on the board, he should find him­self in the right spot from the good draw.</p>
    <p>4 Savvy Nine closed off nicely be­hind Ex­cel­lent Pro­posal last start. He will rel­ish the ex­tra 200m.</p>
    <p>5 Re­li­able Team can take the next step as a five-year-old. Although this is a dif­fi­cult con­test, he should hold on for prize money.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Ex&#xAD;cel&#xAD;lent Pro&#xAD;posal, win&#xAD;ner of both his starts this sea&#xAD;son, is on an up&#xAD;ward tra&#xAD;jec&#xAD;tory to&#xAD;wards the 2021 Four-Year-Old Clas&#xAD;sic Se&#xAD;ries. He looks hard to beat in to&#xAD;mor&#xAD;row&#x2019;s last race.</p>
