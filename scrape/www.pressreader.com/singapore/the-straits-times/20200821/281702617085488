    <p>For­mer Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) crew mem­ber Tris­tan Yap, 31, had been work­ing in a tem­po­rary role as a care am­bas­sador at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH) for just a cou­ple of weeks when he en­coun­tered a pa­tient who was deliri­ous after an accident.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient was strug­gling to get out of his bed even though he was be­ing re­strained. While the nurses were try­ing to help him, they were also busy with sev­eral other tasks.</p>
    <p>See­ing this, Mr Yap vol­un­teered to wheel the pa­tient around the ward to help calm him down, and sub­se­quently helped him with his other needs like his meals. “On the day he was dis­charged, he mo­tioned to me and he gave me the big­gest hug,” he said. “That was when I felt like I found a new call­ing in life.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yap, who has been at SIA for seven years, quit the air­line to join KTPH full-time this month as a pa­tient care of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>He is one of the three SIA cabin crew who have de­cided to take on the newly cre­ated role full-time. There are about 20 peo­ple who have joined so far, with KTPH look­ing to hire a to­tal of 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers will work with doc­tors, nurses and al­lied health staff to take care of pa­tients. For ex­am­ple, they will per­form non-clin­i­cal func­tions such as help­ing pa­tients to clean up and feed­ing them.</p>
    <p>KTPH’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Yen Tan said the work of the 60 SIA crew, such as Mr Yap, tem­po­rar­ily de­ployed at the hos­pi­tal had in­spired it to cre­ate the new job.</p>
    <p>KTPH and SIA had jointly launched a care am­bas­sador pro­gramme in April to tem­po­rar­ily de­ploy SIA crew who are not fly­ing to help at the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said: “This cri­sis showed us that there are peo­ple who want to serve in health­care, but they are wait­ing for the right op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>The new of­fi­cers will un­dergo a full 20-day train­ing cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>Of this, three days of train­ing will be con­ducted by SIA.</p>
    <p>It is the first time SIA is of­fer­ing its train­ing and de­vel­op­ment ser­vices to an ex­ter­nal or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Its cabin crew train­ers will con­duct a three-day course that will fo­cus on in­ter­per­sonal com­mu­ni­ca­tion, cus­tomer han­dling and show­ing val­ues such as em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>SIA and KTPH are also look­ing into other ar­eas of col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the ap­pli­ca­tion of SIA’s crew re­source man­age­ment prac­tices, which are a range of skills to en­hance flight safety and re­duce hu­man er­ror, to KTPH’s op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>For Mr Yap and his two col­leagues who quit SIA to start new full-time jobs at KTPH, they said they had ini­tially de­cided to take on the tem­po­rary care am­bas­sador roles after op­por­tu­ni­ties to fly as cabin crew dried up fol­low­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But they then found mean­ing in what they were do­ing, and de­cided to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Ms Regina Yeoh, 32, who had been work­ing with SIA for eight years, said it took a lot of courage and thought to de­cide on giv­ing up her love for fly­ing and her life­style.</p>
    <p>She had ini­tially wanted to pick up skills in care­giv­ing when tak­ing on the role tem­po­rar­ily. But she found that she adapted well and was happy work­ing there.</p>
    <p>Ms San­dra Goh, 39, a for­mer cabin crew mem­ber for the past 15 years and now a new pa­tient care ex­ec­u­tive at KTPH, said the pas­sion and ded­i­ca­tion shown by the nurses she worked with in­spired her ca­reer switch.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways had an in­ter­est in health­care but just never had the courage to try any­thing... but I thought since now there are no flights, I might as well put my time to bet­ter use and join some­thing mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>“The whole ex­pe­ri­ence put to­gether has been very worth­while and ful­fill­ing.”</p>
    <p>A study found that the pres­ence of such man­agers re­sulted in an in­crease in the num­ber of vol­un­teers at the SSAs.</p>
