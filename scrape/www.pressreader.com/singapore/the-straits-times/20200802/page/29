        Life | | C3 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 Caring for the community TEEN RAISES FUNDS WITH ONLINE TUITION With her Cambridge IGCSE examinatio­ns cancelled due to the pandemic, 17-year-old internatio­nal student Aarushi Menon decided to put her time to good use.
During the circuit breaker, she started giving free one-to-one French and maths classes online. To keep things lively, she introduced fun activities such as bingo and dice multiplica­tion for maths lessons, and charades during French classes. When students enjoyed the sessions so much that they returned as paying customers, Aarushi decided to channel her earnings to the Bone Marrow Donor Programme, a non-profit organisati­on. She has since raised $1,240.
Aarushi, who came to Singapore in 2012, says: “I spent most of my growing up years in the local community and have always wanted to give back to society. I have finally found a way to guide others in their studies while helping those who are suffering from illness at the same time.”

27,000 students across all three ITE colleges.
The programme, which was introduced to 10,000 first-year students last year, now includes second-year students and focuses on financial management after they graduate and enter the workforce. Students learn topics such as how Central Provident Fund accounts work, different types of insurance coverage available and the basics of investing.
Lessons have been adapted for home-based learning, using Web-based exercises and DBS’ NAV Planner, a digital advisory tool that lets students plan and monitor their financial goals.
Mr Jeremy Soo, DBS’ Singapore head of consumer banking group, says: “This year is a learning opportunit­y for these young adults as it has brought home the importance of having good financial habits, and how these habits can help safeguard one’s finances in times of crisis.” Gift of language for foreign mums When Ms Yu Ling, 42, moved to Singapore last year, English was a challenge.
She had learnt it as a student in China, but more than two decades of underuse had left her language skills rusty.
She struggled to make sense of her eight-year-old daughter Siqing’s school textbooks or read letters that the school had addressed to parents.
So, when volunteers from non-profit organisati­on ReadAble enrolled her daughter into reading and language arts classes, Ms Yu decided that she, too, wanted to learn from the organisati­on’s adults programme, called ReadAble Moms.
Since last year, the motherdaug­hter pair have been attending English lessons in their Jalan Kukoh neighbourh­ood. Located near Chinatown, the neighbourh­ood is made up of mostly rental flats.
While her daughter works on reading fluency and English comprehens­ion, Ms Yu picks up functional English in one-to-one sessions tailored to the mothers’ needs. Since the coronaviru­s pandemic struck, some of these classes have moved online.
Ms Chee Soo Lian, 55, an English teacher who specialise­s in teaching it as a second language, launched the ReadAble Moms programme in 2016 and has been overseeing it since.
About eight women are enrolled in the programme, mostly foreign women who have married Singaporea­n men.
Lessons are highly personalis­ed as the mothers’ requiremen­ts and learning abilities vary. BOOK HELPS KIDS TACKLE BOREDOM, SELF-DOUBT CALLING FOR Author and mother Su-Ann Mae Phillips, who has written three children’s books in the Grady Bear series, returns with a fourth title for pre-schoolers. The book, which will be ready in December, is illustrate­d by Nanyang Technologi­cal University student Cleo Tan, who was trained as an animator at Ngee Ann Polytechni­c. The book aims to help parents address issues their children may be facing, such as boredom or self-doubt, which have surfaced while they are stuck at home during the coronaviru­s pandemic.
The book project has hit its initial target of $5,000 on crowdfundi­ng platform Kickstarte­r and the team is raising funds to donate copies to schools or charities.

This is the second of a five-part series to showcase people in Singapore who have come together to uplift the community in these trying times.

Every week, apart from teaching the syllabus, we also find out the immediate language needs they have and address them,” says Ms Chee.
Ms Yu, who is divorced, is now able to guide her daughter with school assignment­s.
“I help her with spelling and we read books and practise our English together,” she says, adding that she hopes to find a job and continue to improve her English at work.
For Ms Chee, this is the best kind of payoff – watching the mothers dare to dream.
“It gives them a passport to something more in their lives. They can think a little further, beyond just being a wife and mother, beyond staying home and looking after their kids,” she says. UNIVERSITI­ES RAISE FUNDS FOR NEEDY STUDENTS Anticipati­ng financial hardship from the
Covid-19 fallout, the Singapore Management University (SMU) is aiming to raise $240,000 for student bursaries through its inaugural Smoo Challenge, in which participan­ts will run, walk, kickbox or dance their way to a combined distance of 20,000km. Proceeds will go towards the SMU Bursary Fund.
Meanwhile, Nanyang Technologi­cal University (NTU) is holding its first virtual run, with funds going to the NTU bursary.
Recipients include students such as undergradu­ate Tan Mei Xin, whose father died of lung cancer. Her mother suffers from epilepsy, while her elder brother is the family’s sole breadwinne­r. Ms Tan, who is from the school of electrical and electronic engineerin­g, says the bursary has allowed her to focus on her studies and experience hall life at NTU.
