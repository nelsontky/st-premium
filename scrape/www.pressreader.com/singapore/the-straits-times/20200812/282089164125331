    <p>The vol­ume of re­sale con­do­mini­ums chang­ing hands nearly dou­bled last month, with about 978 units sold com­pared with 496 units in June.</p>
    <p>Re­sale vol­ume last month was up 10 per cent from July last year, and 9.3 per cent higher than the fiveyear av­er­age vol­umes for the month of July, ac­cord­ing to real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty’s flash es­ti­mates re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Just over half of the units sold last month were lo­cated in the out­side cen­tral re­gion (OCR).</p>
    <p>Units in the rest of cen­tral re­gion (RCR) and core cen­tral re­gion (CCR) ac­counted for 27.8 per cent and 18.6 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak said the trans­ac­tion vol­ume last month showed that the con­do­minium re­sale mar­ket had made a full re­cov­ery from the ef­fects of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>He added that there had been pent-up de­mand dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April 7 to June 1.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, he said, a large num­ber of Hous­ing Board flats had reached the five-year mark and be­come el­i­gi­ble to be sold in the open mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“These flats, which have com­pleted the five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod (MOP) in 2019 and 2020, would re­sult in grow­ing buy­ing de­mand (for pri­vate prop­erty) from HDB up­graders,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Some of these flat own­ers would need to buy com­pleted re­sale con­do­mini­ums for their own stay, hence con­tribut­ing to the in­crease in re­sale con­do­minium trans­ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>An av­er­age of 26,600 ad­di­tional HDB flats hit the five-year mark in each of the two years. This is triple the an­nual av­er­age of 8,800 HDB flats that ful­filled the MOP from 2008 to 2018.</p>
    <p>Over­all, con­do­minium re­sale prices rose 0.1 per cent month on month over June.</p>
    <p>How­ever, year on year, over­all prices were down 0.1 per cent last month. July prices for CCR and RCR re­sale units de­creased by 1.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent, re­spec­tively. Units in the OCR rose by 1.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>PropNex Realty’s head of re­search and con­tent Wong Siew Ying said the price trends con­tinue to re­flect the re­silience of the OCR, or mass mar­ket, seg­ment.</p>
    <p>In this seg­ment, prices tend to be more stable as they are sup­ported by healthy de­mand from a larger pool of up­graders and owner-oc­cu­piers.</p>
    <p>“In con­trast, CCR and RCR re­sale prices could face more pres­sure amid a cri­sis as these re­gions boast pricier prop­er­ties and would ap­peal to a rel­a­tively smaller group of buy­ers and in­vestors com­pared with the mass mar­ket seg­ment,” Ms Wong said.</p>
    <p>OrangeTee & Tie’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said some buy­ers may find the cur­rent pric­ing level com­fort­able enough to en­ter the mar­ket, fear­ing a price rise later. “Oth­ers may view the cur­rent mar­ket slow­down to be an op­por­tu­nity to ne­go­ti­ate a bet­ter deal with sell­ers,” she added.</p>
    <p>She said buy­ers are go­ing for more af­ford­able re­sale prop­er­ties be­low $1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to URA Realis data, 61.9 per cent of non-landed re­sale homes sold last month were be­low $1.5 mil­lion, com­pared with 48.7 per cent in June this year and 56.3 per cent in June last year.</p>
    <p>Sky­line @ Or­chard Boule­vard once again took the top spot for the high­est trans­acted price, with a unit resold for $14.99 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In the RCR, the high­est trans­acted price was $5.85 mil­lion for a unit at Re­flec­tions at Kep­pel Bay.</p>
    <p>As for the OCR, the high­est trans­acted price was for a unit at Ocean Park, which was resold for $2.8 mil­lion. July’s over­all SRX trans­ac­tion over X-value (TOX) data stands at neg­a­tive $10,000, no change from the fig­ures for June and May.</p>
    <p>TOX mea­sures how much a buyer is over­pay­ing (pos­i­tive value) or un­der­pay­ing (neg­a­tive value) for a prop­erty based on SRX’s com­put­er­gen­er­ated mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>The data cov­ers dis­tricts with more than 10 re­sale trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>District 18 (Pasir Ris/Tampines) posted the high­est me­dian TOX at pos­i­tive $9,500, fol­lowed by District 16 (Be­dok/Up­per East Coast) at pos­i­tive $5,000.</p>
    <p>The low­est me­di­ans were found in District 4 (Sen­tosa/Har­bourFront) at neg­a­tive $90,000 fol­lowed by District 10 (Tan­glin/Hol­land/Bukit Timah) at neg­a­tive $70,000.</p>
    <p>ERA’s Mr Mak said re­sale con­do­minium trans­ac­tion vol­ume could re­turn to a monthly sale vol­ume of be­tween 600 and 1,100 units in the com­ing months, as­sum­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic is man­aged well in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But he added that eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties would put a cap on prop­erty prices, caus­ing the re­sale con­do­minium price in­dex to vary be­tween +1.5 per cent and -1.0 per cent year on year for 2020.</p>

        <p data-role="text">In the rest of cen&#xAD;tral re&#xAD;gion, the high&#xAD;est trans&#xAD;acted price was $5.85 mil&#xAD;lion for a unit at Re&#xAD;flec&#xAD;tions at Kep&#xAD;pel Bay (above), while Sky&#xAD;line @ Or&#xAD;chard Boule&#xAD;vard once again took the top spot for the high&#xAD;est trans&#xAD;acted price, with a unit resold for $14.99 mil&#xAD;lion.</p>
