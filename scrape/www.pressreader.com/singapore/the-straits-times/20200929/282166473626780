    <p>Agri-food gi­ant Olam In­ter­na­tional has ob­tained Sin­ga­pore’s first club loan pegged to the Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora).</p>
    <p>A club loan is a type of syn­di­cated loan with more than one party pro­vid­ing the fi­nanc­ing. In this case, the loan comes from DBS Bank and the In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China, Sin­ga­pore branch.</p>
    <p>Olam has the op­tion to en­ter into a Sora cross-cur­rency swap with DBS at the start of each in­ter­est pe­riod, giv­ing added cer­tainty on in­ter­est rates and swap Sing­dol­lar pro­ceeds into United States dol­lars, noted a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The loan and the cross-cur­rency swap mark an­other mile­stone in Sin­ga­pore’s tran­si­tion to­wards adopt­ing Sora as the new in­ter­est rate bench­mark for Sing­dol­lar cash and deriva­tives mar­kets, it added.</p>
    <p>The loan fa­cil­ity’s in­ter­est rate com­prises two com­po­nents – a com­pounded daily Sora rate cal­cu­lated in ar­rears and an ap­pli­ca­ble mar­gin.</p>
    <p>Pro­ceeds will be used for gen­eral cor­po­rate pur­poses for Olam and its sub­sidiaries.</p>
    <p>Olam man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and group chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer N. Muthuku­mar said the loan pro­vides Olam with “the flex­i­bil­ity to re­main adapt­able and fu­tur­eready it­self as we em­brace the in­dus­try’s shift to­wards main­stream adop­tion of the new bench­mark for the cash and deriva­tives mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Su Shan, head of DBS’ in­sti­tu­tional bank­ing group, added: “By adopt­ing Sora-based fi­nanc­ing ahead of the mar­ket, for­ward-look­ing com­pa­nies such as Olam are... gain­ing an early un­der­stand­ing of how Sora works, and how to bet­ter tap Sorabased cash and deriva­tives mar­kets as in­dus­try adop­tion grows and liq­uid­ity deep­ens.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said it will step up su­per­vi­sory en­gage­ment to en­sure that banks here are well pre­pared to tran­si­tion from the Swap Of­fer Rate (SOR) – a key in­ter­est rate bench­mark – to Sora by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore banks be­gan a two-year tran­si­tion from SOR to Sora last year as the scan­dal-tainted Lon­don In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate is due to meet its end af­ter next year.</p>
    <p>A bank­ing in­dus­try re­port in July also rec­om­mended that the Sing­dol­lar Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate be dis­con­tin­ued in three to four years, and that Sora be used as the main bench­mark for Sing­dol­lar fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
