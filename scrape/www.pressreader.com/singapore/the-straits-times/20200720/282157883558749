    <p>In­ter­na­tional schools in Sin­ga­pore have ex­tended fi­nan­cial help to stu­dents, as fam­i­lies feel the ef­fects of the global eco­nomic slow­down.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral schools have set up funds, while some have an­nounced fee re­duc­tions and re­frained from tu­ition fee hikes for the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>These ef­forts come as a re­cent sur­vey of 122 ex­pa­tri­ate par­ents in Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong shows that about a third of them have re­ported a cut in in­come due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The on­line poll by mar­ket re­search firm BDRC Asia in April also found that more than half of par­ents may want to switch schools or re­view school op­tions for their chil­dren in the fu­ture, if the job sit­u­a­tion wors­ens.</p>
    <p>The com­pany plans to con­duct an­other sur­vey of 400 ex­pat par­ents in Sin­ga­pore in the fourth quar­ter of this year to re­assess the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on the in­ter­na­tional schools mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has about 30 in­ter­na­tional schools for ex­pa­tri­ates and an­nual fees at the top-tier schools hover around $35,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Tom Evans, di­rec­tor of mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Tan­glin Trust School, said: “There is a lot of un­cer­tainty in the Tan­glin com­mu­nity, just as there is in all of Sin­ga­pore. Some par­ents lost their jobs and oth­ers had salary cuts.”</p>
    <p>The cur­rent term fees at Tan­glin Trust School in Ports­down Road were re­duced by 5 per cent to 10 per cent, while the fees for the next aca­demic year, which starts in late Au­gust, will not in­crease. Its an­nual tu­ition fees range from $27,714 to $45,828, de­pend­ing on the level of stu­dents. It has 2,800 stu­dents en­rolled.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the Sin­ga­pore Amer­i­can School (SAS), which had an­nounced a 3.5 per cent fee in­crease for the new school year that starts next month, has frozen tu­ition and fees in­stead. Its an­nual fees for re­turn­ing fam­i­lies are be­tween $30,000 and $44,000.</p>
    <p>“Fam­i­lies with fi­nan­cial needs have the op­por­tu­nity to pay their tu­ition through in­stal­ment pay­ments,” said its su­per­in­ten­dent, Mr Tom Boas­berg.</p>
    <p>The school, which has a 4,000-strong stu­dent body, also cre­ated a fund to meet press­ing fi­nan­cial needs of fam­i­lies dur­ing this pe­riod, and hopes to re­spond to needs within its im­me­di­ate Wood­lands com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Boas­berg: “We will also use money from this ded­i­cated fund to help pro­vide as­sis­tance to SAS fac­ulty and staff and their fam­i­lies who need sup­port.”</p>
    <p>The United World Col­lege South East Asia (UWCSEA), which has also frozen fees for the next school year, had an­nounced in April that stu­dents en­rolled for the next aca­demic year would each re­ceive a $1,000 credit on their fee in­voice. School fees range from $35,000 to $43,000 for ex­ist­ing stu­dents.</p>
    <p>The col­lege’s “with­drawal with­out fi­nan­cial penalty” deadline has also been ex­tended so fam­i­lies could have more time be­fore com­mit­ting to the new school year next month. It has about 5,500 stu­dents en­rolled.</p>
    <p>Ms Sinéad Collins, UWCSEA’s di­rec­tor of en­gage­ment and ex­ter­nal re­la­tions, said: “Fam­i­lies who had ac­cepted a place for their child, and paid Term 1 fees to se­cure their child’s place, were of­fered a re­fund of fees if they were no longer able to re­lo­cate to Sin­ga­pore for Covid-re­lated rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>The col­lege – which runs two cam­puses, one in Dover and an­other in Tampines – also launched last month a fi­nan­cial re­lief pro­gramme for fam­i­lies who are most in need of short-term re­lief.</p>
    <p>At the In­ter­na­tional French School (Sin­ga­pore), a Covid-19 Sol­i­dar­ity Fund has been set up to as­sist fam­i­lies in need. The school in Ang Mo Kio, with about 3,000 stu­dents, has also of­fered fam­i­lies a $600 cash­back on school fees per child. Its an­nual fees range from about $10,500 to $26,990.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris­tian Soulard, the school’s prin­ci­pal, said it had re­ceived some con­cerns from its school com­mu­nity on their job se­cu­rity and in some cases, the fi­nan­cial im­pact of the cri­sis on their house­holds.</p>
    <p>In­vic­tus In­ter­na­tional School has helped about 17 per cent of its stu­dent pop­u­la­tion through fee waivers and dis­counts.</p>
    <p>It waived aca­demic fees for the ex­ist­ing school year for par­ents who have lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, and pro­vided fee dis­counts for chil­dren whose par­ents had salaries cut.</p>
    <p>An­nual fees at the school at its two cam­puses in Dempsey and Sen­tosa range from $17,000 to $18,800. A third cam­pus com­ing up in Far­rer Park next month will boost its to­tal stu­dent pop­u­la­tion to about 700 stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Like lo­cal schools here, in­ter­na­tional schools had closed for some time this year dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing t hat time i n March, schools were con­cerned about the rise in im­ported coro­n­avirus cases and ex­pat fam­i­lies re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore from over­seas.</p>
    <p>The schools had also shifted learn­ing on­line, be­fore re­open­ing grad­u­ally from June 2, with stu­dents re­turn­ing to cam­pus in stages.</p>
    <p>The schools told The Straits Times that they have con­tin­ued to use tools such as video-con­fer­enc­ing although face-to-face lessons have re­sumed, in ways like en­gag­ing par­ents and set­ting home­work for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>While peo­ple think ex­pat fam­i­lies may want to leave Sin­ga­pore be­cause of the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, Mr Evans said Tan­glin Trust School has seen many more stu­dents who were plan­ning to go to board­ing school in Bri­tain de­cid­ing to stay here in­stead.</p>
    <p>“We hope that the mea­sures we put in place helped con­trib­ute to the sta­bil­ity in our com­mu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>LOTS OF UN­CER­TAINTY</p>
    <p>There is a lot of un­cer­tainty in the Tan­glin com­mu­nity, just as there is in all of Sin­ga­pore. Some par­ents lost their jobs ’’ and oth­ers had salary cuts.</p>
    <p>MR TOM EVANS, di­rec­tor of mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Tan­glin Trust School.</p>
    <p>RE­FUND OF FEES</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies who had ac­cepted a place for their child, and paid Term 1 fees to se­cure their child’s place, were of­fered a re­fund of fees if they were no longer able to re­lo­cate to Sin­ga­pore for Covid-re­lated ’’ rea­sons.</p>
    <p>MS SINÉAD COLLINS, UWCSEA’s di­rec­tor of en­gage­ment and ex­ter­nal re­la­tions.</p>
