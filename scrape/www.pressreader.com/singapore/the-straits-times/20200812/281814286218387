    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has sug­gested host­ing the Group of Seven (G-7) sum­mit af­ter the Novem­ber pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, say­ing he would in­vite coun­tries gen­er­ally ex­cluded from the global meet­ings.</p>
    <p>“I am much more in­clined to do it some­time af­ter the elec­tion. We were go­ing to do it in Septem­ber, they’d like to do it,” Mr Trump said on Mon­day, dur­ing his near-daily press brief­ing on the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We could do it through tele­con­fer­ence or we could do it through a meet­ing... I tell my peo­ple, ‘Ac­tu­ally, why don’t we do it some­time af­ter the elec­tion when things are a bit, you have a lit­tle more time to think about it be­cause it’s very im­por­tant’,” he said.</p>
    <p>The G-7 brings to­gether the lead­ers of some of the world’s rich­est coun­tries, who meet to dis­cuss po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had ini­tially wanted to hold an in-per­son sum­mit in Wash­ing­ton in June – an idea that Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel re­jected.</p>
    <p>He then post­poned it to Septem­ber, hop­ing to show a re­turn to nor­mal in the United States as he seeks a sec­ond term in the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>When an­nounc­ing the post­pone­ment in June, he said he would widen the in­vi­ta­tion to other lead­ers, in­clud­ing Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, who was kicked out of the group over Rus­sia’s takeover of Crimea.</p>
    <p>The com­ments on Mon­day seemed to im­ply a sim­i­lar line of thought. “We will in­vite cer­tain peo­ple that aren’t in the G-7,” Mr Trump told re­porters. “Some peo­ple have al­ready ac­cepted, but we’re go­ing to be do­ing it af­ter the elec­tion. I think it’s a bet­ter, calmer at­mos­phere to have a G-7.”</p>
    <p>In July, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo de­fended Mr Trump’s sug­ges­tion of invit­ing Mr Putin to the sum­mit, telling re­porters the Pres­i­dent “gets to de­cide if he wants (Putin) to come to a sum­mit or not”.</p>
