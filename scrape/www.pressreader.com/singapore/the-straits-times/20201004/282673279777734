    <p>Av­enue 87, a month-old mod­ern Asian restau­rant in Amoy Street, comes with a nice little story be­hind its name.</p>
    <p>It is opened by two 33-year-old Sin­ga­porean chefs – Glen Tay, who grew up in Hougang Av­enue 8, and Alex Phan, who lived in Hougang Av­enue 7.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they did not meet un­til they be­came class­mates at Shatec’s culi­nary school. After grad­u­at­ing, they worked to­gether at Tip­pling Club in Tan­jong Pa­gar Road. And when they went their sep­a­rate ways, their friend­ship con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>Phan worked at Open Door Policy, Sor­rel, Restau­rant Ember and, most re­cently, Park Ho­tel Clarke Quay, where he was the ex­ec­u­tive chef. Tay, mean­while, moved to Shang­hai in 2018 to join the three-Miche­lin­starred Ul­travi­o­let as ex­ec­u­tive sous chef.</p>
    <p>When an in­vestor ap­proached him to open a restau­rant in Sin­ga­pore this year, he roped in Phan. The duo planned the menu to­gether, which is based on fa­mil­iar Asian flavours, but trans­lated in their own way.</p>
    <p>While the idea is not new, what the two chefs bring to the ta­ble is a re­fresh­ing un­der­stand­ing of the im­por­tance of tex­tures. Also, they do not come across as try­ing too hard.</p>
    <p>You will recog­nise the flavours with­out any need for ex­pla­na­tion of their in­spi­ra­tion – though the server ex­plains any­way – and be im­pressed by how the chefs some­times make it bet­ter than the orig­i­nal.</p>
    <p>Lunch of­fers two- and three-course sets with mains like fried chicken or duck con­fit with yam rice. But to ex­pe­ri­ence the chefs’ full po­ten­tial, go for din­ner in­stead. There are two menus, four cour­ses for $76 and six for $98.</p>
    <p>I have tried both on sep­a­rate vis­its and sug­gest you get the big­ger menu. The two ex­tra dishes are worth the $22 dif­fer­ence. And while two of the other dishes are the same, you get a seabass broth that is bet­ter than the black chicken soup in the cheaper menu.</p>
