    <p>There is more than meets the eye with the Pizze­ria Ve­su­vio, lo­cated some­where in the up­scale parts of south-west Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The Italian restaurant is a place where white wait­resses dish up pas­tas and piz­zas, but in the back kitchen, the peo­ple do­ing the cook­ing are Sri Lankan im­mi­grants.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral fig­ure in Nikita Lal­wani’s third novel, You Peo­ple, is Ve­su­vio’s owner, Tuli. Born in Sin­ga­pore to Tamil par­ents who were teach­ers, he is charm­ing, mys­te­ri­ous, se­cre­tive, and the go-to man for those in trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Sent to Bri­tain to study law by his mid­dle-class par­ents, he now owns Ve­su­vio – though how that came to be, no one quite knows.</p>
    <p>Ve­su­vio re­flects a few of Tuli’s own qual­i­ties: some parts are hid­den, it is se­lec­tive in what it re­veals, it is wit­ness to se­cret deals and ul­ti­mately, it seems to pos­sess the power to pro­tect and heal those in need.</p>
    <p>Tuli does many things in the shad­ows and en­lists the help of al­lies whose scru­ples are not en­tirely clear, but his key aim is to help those who have no other choice. Al­ter­na­tively, he may have a god com­plex – no one is re­ally sure.</p>
    <p>The story al­ter­nates be­tween Welsh-Ben­gali wait­ress Nia and Shan, a Sri Lankan refugee seek­ing asy­lum. Both work at Ve­su­vio.</p>
    <p>Nia has run away from an al­co­holic, drug-ad­dled mother and Shan has left be­hind his wife De­vaki and young son Karu in his home coun­try, which is in the throes of civil war.</p>
    <p>Also work­ing at the restaurant are a wait­ress who might be Span­ish and a bevy of Sri Lankan cooks who are sav­ing up to feed the dream of open­ing their own Pizza Ex­press.</p>
    <p>In­dia-born, Lon­don-based Lal­wani’s prose deftly in­hab­its this cos­mopoli­tan, clois­tered com­mu­nity. Warn­ing Nia against making eye con­tact with an erst­while as­so­ciate of Tuli, who is stand­ing out­side the restaurant, Shan says: “Is danger­ous. You don’t look at him, Nia, lis­ten. Not good he know your face.”</p>
    <p>El­e­ments such as this, as well as the con­stant spec­tre of im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cers barg­ing into the restaurant, sup­ply the novel with the bal­last that makes it read like a thriller.</p>
    <p>Tuli plays a danger­ous game and his ac­tiv­i­ties – bun­dles of cash in plas­tic bags, thou­sands of pounds in loans recorded in a se­cret ledger – threaten to im­peril Shan, Nia and Tuli him­self.</p>
    <p>There are parts where Lal­wani takes the prose too far, such as a de­scrip­tion of Nia’s “firm, swollen, erotic curves”, but this is a mi­nor quib­ble.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, the novel man­ages to dig deep into the men­tal state, emo­tional dis­tress and vaulted as­pi­ra­tions of peo­ple like Shan and Nia.</p>
    <p>It draws par­al­lels be­tween those who seek refuge from abu­sive, poor and derelict fam­ily lives, and those who have clam­bered out of a coun­try rav­aged by war, where there is no hope of imag­in­ing a fu­ture.</p>
    <p>At its ker­nel, the novel poses dif­fi­cult ques­tions: Are there moral lim­its to help­ing some­one who is out of op­tions? What about the risks – and how much is ac­cept­able? What about the reper­cus­sions and are they worth it?</p>
    <p>It also urges those in po­si­tions of priv­i­lege to look dif­fer­ently at the peo­ple who live at the mar­gins and con­sider if they, too, de­serve a shot at a bet­ter life.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Amnesty by Aravind Adiga (Pan Macmillan, 2020, $29.95, avail­able at bit.ly/Amnesty_AA). Danny, an un­doc­u­mented Sri Lankan im­mi­grant who works as a cleaner in Sydney, sus­pects one of his clients has mur­dered another, but fears be­ing de­ported if he goes to the po­lice.</p>
