    <p>When Ms Mar­griet Vonno, 54, was di­ag­nosed with breast can­cer in Jan­uary this year, she thought she would not live to see an­other Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>“Most of the women I knew who had the dis­ease did not sur­vive, so nat­u­rally, I was dev­as­tated when my on­col­o­gist con­firmed the di­ag­no­sis,” says the Am­bas­sador of the Nether­lands to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But 10 months on, she has beaten the dis­ease and is now can­cer-free.</p>
    <p>And not only will she be cel­e­brat­ing Christ­mas next month, but Ms Vonno has also man­aged to keep up an an­nual tra­di­tion since she moved to Sin­ga­pore in 2017 with her hus­band, 57, and their 14-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the Gar­dens by the Bay’s hor­ti­cul­tural team, she has put to­gether Poin­set­tia Wishes – the at­trac­tion’s year-end flo­ral dis­play which started yes­ter­day and runs till Jan 3.</p>
    <p>Since 2018, she has been ac­tively in­volved in or­gan­is­ing the an­nual Tulip­ma­nia, usu­ally held in April, at Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>It is an event she takes spe­cial pride in as the tulip is her coun­try’s na­tional flower.</p>
    <p>A cham­pion of sus­tain­abil­ity, Ms Vonno had been up­set to hear that flow­ers from Am­s­ter­dam had to be de­stroyed when Covid-19 dis­rupted global de­mand.</p>
    <p>As this year’s Tulip­ma­nia had to be can­celled, Poin­set­tia Wishes gave her a chance to re­pur­pose some of the props from the dis­play.</p>
    <p>The Christ­mas dis­play has a dis­tinctly Dutch theme. It fea­tures a replica of the Nether­lands’ iconic Gouda Town Hall, known for its Christ­mas can­dle light-up, nes­tled amid poin­set­tias in a bold va­ri­ety of colours along­side tem­per­ate flow­ers grown here in spe­cial green­house con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But for a while after her can­cer di­ag­no­sis, the thought of do­ing an­other flo­ral dis­play was the fur­thest thing on Ms Vonno’s mind.</p>
    <p>She was not able to leave the hospi­tal to be with her fam­ily as her treat­ment pe­riod was dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. She also had to rel­e­gate work to the side­lines.</p>
    <p>She re­calls: “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, I could not see my fam­ily or re­ceive vis­i­tors at a time when I felt very alone and vul­ner­a­ble.”</p>
    <p>But there was a sil­ver lin­ing amid the de­spair.</p>
    <p>“I re­ceived bou­quets and getwell notes from Sin­ga­pore min­is­ters, for­eign diplo­mats and friends, and the sight of those beau­ti­ful flow­ers helped heal and en­er­gise me,” says Ms Vonno, who de­vel­oped a love of flow­ers in her teens while work­ing at a Dutch tulip farm dur­ing her school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>She kept her spir­its up by fo­cus­ing on de­sign­ing the poin­set­tia dis­play, meet­ing the Gar­dens’ team through video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, after more</p>
    <p>than 10 months of chemo­ther­apy and ra­dio­ther­apy, her doc­tors de­clared her can­cer-free.</p>
    <p>“I had been given a new lease of life,” says Ms Vonno, who de­cided to re­flect the mile­stone through bright red and white flow­ers in the flo­ral dis­play, pay­ing trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore with its na­tional colours at the same time.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve no Sin­ga­porean has been spared by Covid-19, so I hope my Poin­set­tia Wishes homage this year sends a mes­sage about the im­por­tance of stay­ing re­silient in the face of even the worst ad­ver­sity.”</p>
