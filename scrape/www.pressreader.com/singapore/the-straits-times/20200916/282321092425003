    <p>Ma­jor oil in­dus­try pro­duc­ers and traders are fore­cast­ing a bleak fu­ture for world­wide fuel de­mand, due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic’s on­go­ing as­sault on the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus ham­mered fuel de­mand in the spring, caus­ing con­sump­tion to drop by more than onethird as bil­lions of peo­ple world­wide re­stricted their move­ments. Con­sump­tion re­bounded in the sum­mer, but some coun­tries where in­fec­tions were un­der con­trol are see­ing a resur­gence in the deadly virus, spark­ing waves of lock­downs that could ham­per the re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“Risks re­main el­e­vated and skewed to the down­side, par­tic­u­larly in re­la­tion to the de­vel­op­ment of Covid-19 in­fec­tion cases and po­ten­tial vac­cines,” said the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Petroleum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries (Opec) in its monthly re­port re­leased on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The virus has in­fected more than 29 mil­lion peo­ple, with roughly 925,000 deaths in roughly nine months, ac­cord­ing to Reuters data. Sev­eral com­pa­nies are work­ing on a vac­cine, but it is likely months away from mass dis­tri­bu­tion, and it is un­clear how ef­fec­tive any vac­cine will be in pre­vent­ing fu­ture out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Opec cut its out­look for de­mand this year, say­ing world oil de­mand would fall by 9.46 mil­lion bar­rels per day (bpd) this year, an in­crease of 400,000 bpd from its pre­vi­ous re­port. It cut its out­look for Asian coun­tries be­yond China.</p>
    <p>Global prices were wal­loped in April, with US crude fu­tures fall­ing at one point through neg­a­tive-US$40 a bar­rel. Prices of both US crude and Brent re­cov­ered, but both are now trad­ing at less than US$40 due to the weak re­bound in de­mand.</p>
    <p>“As economies around the world opened up, there was op­ti­mism and en­thu­si­asm that we would just head back to nor­mal over some pe­riod of time,” said Mr An­drew Lipow, pres­i­dent of Lipow Oil As­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>“What we’re see­ing now is that there’s more pes­simism be­cause we’re see­ing a resur­gence of the virus around the world,” he added.</p>
    <p>En­ergy gi­ant BP, in its 2020 out­look re­leased on Mon­day, pro­jected in its base-case sce­nario that oil con­sump­tion peaked for good last year due to the health crisis, and that the coro­n­avirus could slash oil de­mand by about three mil­lion bpd by 2025 and by two mil­lion bpd by 2050.</p>
    <p>Vi­tol chief ex­ec­u­tive Rus­sell Hardy sounded a more pos­i­tive note, telling a global petroleum con­fer­ence in Sin­ga­pore that oil de­mand in trans­porta­tion sec­tors, with the ex­cep­tion of jet fuel, could re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els by the fourth quar­ter of next year. That could help drain a surge of in­ven­to­ries, which grew by roughly 1.2 bil­lion bar­rels in tanks and in water stor­age, he said.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket is slowly chew­ing through that ex­cess in­ven­tory,” Mr Hardy said, adding that about 300 mil­lion bar­rels have been drawn down from this year’s peak.</p>
    <p>Re­fin­ers world­wide have been cut­ting pro­cess­ing due to weak over­all de­mand and an abun­dance of crude. In the United States, prod­uct sup­plied over the past four weeks has been 16 per cent be­low the same time pe­riod a year ago, ac­cord­ing to US En­ergy Depart­ment fig­ures.</p>
    <p>A dent in de­mand caused by a con­tin­u­ing rise in cases or a sec­ond wave presents “the most likely shock that the oil mar­ket needs to be con­sid­er­ing in the next 12 to 24 months”, said Vi­tol’s global head of re­search Gio­vanni Se­rio.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency (IEA) is set to up­date its pro­jec­tions for global oil de­mand in its monthly re­port due yes­ter­day, after an IEA of­fi­cial said this month that the mar­ket ap­peared to be stuck be­tween a stalled re­cov­ery and the ab­sence of any ma­jor new lock­downs.</p>
