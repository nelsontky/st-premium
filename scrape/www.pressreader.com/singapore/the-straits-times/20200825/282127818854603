    <p>A teacher claimed trial in a dis­trict court yes­ter­day to al­legedly mo­lest­ing a 12-year-old boy on three oc­ca­sions in 2017.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old Sin­ga­porean, who had taught in a pri­mary school, can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the boy’s iden­tity. Court doc­u­ments do not dis­close the na­ture of their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to The Straits Times yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said that the man has been sus­pended from ser­vice since July 2017 and is no longer teach­ing at any school.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman added: “MOE takes a se­ri­ous view of staff mis­con­duct and will not hes­i­tate to take dis­ci­plinary ac­tion against those who fail to ad­here to our stan­dards of con­duct and dis­ci­pline, in­clud­ing dis­missal from ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>The man has claimed trial to three counts of mo­lesta­tion. Two other charges in­volv­ing the boy – one count each of as­sault and show­ing him a porno­graphic video – will be dealt with later.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments say the man al­legedly as­saulted the boy in April 2017 by grab­bing his wrists and slap­ping his cheek. He is ac­cused of show­ing the boy a porno­graphic video on a com­puter on June 15 that year. He is also al­leged to have mo­lested the boy on two sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions that day.</p>
    <p>The man al­legedly mo­lested the boy again on June 16, 2017.</p>
    <p>His bail has been set at $15,000, and the trial re­sumes to­day. Of­fend­ers con­victed of mo­lest­ing a child below 14 years old can be jailed for up to five years and fined or caned for each charge.</p>
