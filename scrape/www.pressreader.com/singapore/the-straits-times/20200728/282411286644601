    <p>Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings chair­man Lee Boon Yang (left) has do­nated $100,000 to the School of the Arts (Sota) En­dow­ment Fund, which pro­vides bur­saries, schol­ar­ships and other forms of fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to stu­dents pur­su­ing the arts.</p>
    <p>“Sota is a unique in­sti­tu­tion in Sin­ga­pore,” said Dr Lee in a state­ment yes­ter­day. “It pro­vides young Sin­ga­pore­ans with the op­por­tu­nity for in­ten­sive aca­demic and arts ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, like ev­ery­thing that is rare, it comes at a cost. For some par­ents with tal­ented chil­dren, the cost may be more than they can bear.</p>
    <p>“This is where the Sota En­dow­ment Fund can make a crit­i­cal dif­fer­ence. The fund will be able to sup­port such de­serv­ing stu­dents and en­able them to re­alise their full po­ten­tial in both aca­demic stud­ies and the arts.”</p>
    <p>It is Dr Lee’s sec­ond do­na­tion of $100,000 to the fund, which was started last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee, who is also Kep­pel Cor­po­ra­tion chair­man and for­merly Min­is­ter for In­for­ma­tion, Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and the Arts, added: “I hope to see more or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als step for­ward to help make arts ed­u­ca­tion more ac­ces­si­ble and join this noble ef­fort to nur­ture fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of artists and cre­ative pro­fes­sion­als to en­rich our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Alumna Ash­ley Jane Leow, who re­ceived the Sota Bur­sary, said: “The fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance I re­ceived eased the bur­den on my fam­ily as the bur­sary sup­ported my school fees and ma­te­ri­als used for my art form and stud­ies... It also gave me the con­fi­dence that my ef­forts as an artist were be­ing recog­nised.”</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old, who is study­ing film on an In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity schol­ar­ship at Emer­son Col­lege and Paris Col­lege of Art, added: “I am grate­ful to the donors who be­lieve in a Sota ed­u­ca­tion and sup­port pur­suit of the arts.”</p>
    <p>Sota held its Awards Day cer­e­mony on­line yes­ter­day, in the light of re­stric­tions due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. The cer­e­mony made use of videos and so­cial me­dia fea­tures.</p>
    <p>The school noted in a state­ment yes­ter­day: “The se­vere eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic has not spared the arts com­mu­nity. Many artists and cre­ative prac­ti­tion­ers face an un­cer­tain fu­ture where their liveli­hoods are con­cerned. This may cre­ate a neg­a­tive im­pres­sion on the value of the arts.</p>
    <p>“Sota is com­mit­ted to ris­ing above such short-term chal­lenges and (work­ing) to groom fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans with a strong com­mit­ment to the arts.”</p>
