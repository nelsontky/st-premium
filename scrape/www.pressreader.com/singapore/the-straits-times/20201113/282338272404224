    <p>• A ver­dict by the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS) on Rus­sia’s ap­peal against a four-year ban for dop­ing must be un­am­bigu­ous so it is im­ple­mented ahead of the Tokyo Olympics next year, the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia was sanc­tioned l ast year af­ter the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada) con­cluded that Moscow had planted fake ev­i­dence and deleted files linked to pos­i­tive dop­ing tests in lab­o­ra­tory data that could have helped iden­tify drug cheats.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has ap­pealed to CAS which heard the case last week and a de­ci­sion is ex­pected by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>“In the hear­ing our rep­re­sen­ta­tives have re­peated the call of the IOC to have a clear and un­am­bigu­ous de­ci­sion which can be di­rectly im­ple­mented and which does not need any in­ter­pre­ta­tion and would not trig­ger new court cases and CAS pro­ce­dures,” IOC pres­i­dent Thomas Bach said.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo Olympics were post­poned in March for the first time in the Games’ 124-year his­tory, and are due to run from July 23 to Aug 8 next year.</p>
    <p>The case against Rus­sia started with a 2015 re­port com­mis­sioned by Wada that found ev­i­dence of mass dop­ing among track and field ath­letes.</p>
    <p>“We have been in­formed the panel in­di­cated the de­ci­sion can be ex­pected be­fore the end of the year,” Bach said in a vir­tual news con­fer­ence at the end of the IOC Ex­ec­u­tive Board meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“This was very good news for every­body be­cause it would cre­ate some cer­tainty seven months be­fore the Tokyo Games.”</p>
    <p>Should the ban be up­held, Rus­sia’s teams and ath­letes would only com­pete at ma­jor sport­ing events, in­clud­ing the Olympics, as neu­trals, with­out the coun­try’s flag or na­tional an­them.</p>
    <p>Many of its ath­letes have missed the past two Olympics and the coun­try was stripped of its flag at the 2018 Pyeongchan­g Win­ter Games as pu­n­ish­ment for state-spon­sored dop­ing at the 2014 Sochi Games.</p>
    <p>The ban also meant Rus­sia could miss foot­ball’s 2022 World Cup in Qatar and the 2022 Win­ter Olympics in China.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport is set to de­liver a ver­dict on Rus­sia’s ap­peal seven months be­fore the start of the Olympics next year.</p>
