    <p>Quah Ting Wen (right) smashed Amanda Lim’s six-year-old na­tional 50m freestyle short-course mark by clock­ing 24.26 sec­onds at the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League in Hun­gary on Mon­day. It had taken her less than two weeks to fine-tune her tech­nique and speed af­ter a nine-month break due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing to rac­ing af­ter a ninemonth hia­tus was tough for na­tional swim­mer Quah Ting Wen, as she found her­self en­dur­ing a rusty start to her In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League (ISL) de­but.</p>
    <p>The days lead­ing up to her ar­rival in Bu­dapest, Hun­gary on Oct 11 were fraught with un­cer­tainty and chal­lenges af­ter her ini­tial flight plans were thrown into dis­ar­ray.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the chaotic few days, the 28-year-old, who competes for ISL team, DC Tri­dent, took some time to eval­u­ate her per­for­mance and iden­tify ar­eas to im­prove on, be­fore she worked on fine-tun­ing her tech­nique and skill work.</p>
    <p>That proved to be a game changer as on Mon­day – less than two weeks af­ter her first race – she broke the Sin­ga­pore short-course record for the 50m freestyle when she clocked 24.26 sec­onds at the Duna Arena, eclips­ing Amanda Lim’s mark of 25.09sec set in 2014.</p>
    <p>Quah told The Straits Times: “The first meet was kind of rough, I felt very rusty. It was just un­com­fort­able rac­ing so I took a day af­ter the meet to re­flect be­cause that was only one match.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon, and I knew I had to find a way to pick my­self up and turn it around if I wanted to con­trib­ute to my team.”</p>
    <p>Set­ting a new na­tional short­course record in the 50m free be­came a goal for Quah af­ter she hit the sub-25sec mark sev­eral times ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>She said: “But it wasn’t of­fi­cial and at the back of my mind, I knew I wanted it.”</p>
    <p>In Mon­day’s race, she fin­ished joint fourth with Cali Con­dors’ Olivia Smoliga in Match Four of the 2020 ISL, be­hind NY Break­ers’ Ka­sia Wa­sick (23.43) and Iron’s Ranomi Kro­mowid­jojo (23.82) and Me­lanie Henique (23.88).</p>
    <p>That per­for­mance was also a con­fi­dence boost for Quah, who is aim­ing to qual­ify for next year’s Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>She is un­doubt­edly the na­tion’s pre-em­i­nent fe­male freestyle spe­cial­ist, hold­ing the 50m (24.92sec), 100m (54.62) and 200m (1:59.21) long-course na­tional records. Last year, she low­ered the 50m mark twice and the 100m one four times.</p>
    <p>“It (the record) gives me con­fi­dence. I knew what­ever hap­pened I was go­ing to take the op­por­tu­nity to come and race,” said Quah of her de­ci­sion to be­come the first Sin­ga­porean to join the ISL, a pro­fes­sional in­ter-team com­pe­ti­tion which is in its sec­ond sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Over the last few years, I’ve been con­fi­dent in mak­ing de­ci­sions and un­der­stand­ing what I need men­tally, emo­tion­ally and psy­chi­cally, and it feels good to be able to speak up and take own­er­ship of that. This is a bonus and adds to that con­fi­dence.”</p>
