    <p>There ap­pears to be a marked in­crease in in­ter­est re­cently in lo­cal sen­tenc­ing cases among the pub­lic in Sin­ga­pore. As sen­tenc­ing schol­ars Ju­lian Roberts and Jan de Kei­jser, from the Univer­sity of Ox­ford and Lei­den Univer­sity re­spec­tively, have pointed out, sen­tenc­ing is a process where a court im­poses a le­gal pun­ish­ment on be­half of the com­mu­nity in which the crime is com­mit­ted. There­fore, in my view, it can be a pos­i­tive and en­cour­ag­ing de­vel­op­ment when mem­bers of a com­mu­nity be­come more in­ter­ested in the sen­tenc­ing sys­tem. To this end, it might be use­ful to take this op­por­tu­nity to elab­o­rate on three broad as­pects of sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The first is that sen­tenc­ing is a very fact-sen­si­tive ex­er­cise. Courts around the world have ob­served that in sen­tenc­ing, no two cases are ever ex­actly alike.</p>
    <p>There will be fac­tors that ne­ces­si­tate the im­pos­ing of a harsher sen­tence, and oth­ers that jus­tify a less harsh pun­ish­ment. The former fac­tors are known as ag­gra­vat­ing fac­tors, and the lat­ter are mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors. The ex­act rel­e­vant ag­gra­vat­ing and mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors would al­most al­ways dif­fer from one in­di­vid­ual case to the next.</p>
    <p>Take, for ex­am­ple, two of­fend­ers, A and B, who each com­mit­ted the same of­fence in iden­ti­cal cir­cum­stances, but A has a crim­i­nal record while B is a first-time of­fender. Gen­er­ally and in­tu­itively, we would ac­cept that A should be given a harsher pun­ish­ment com­pared to B. In­deed, a crim­i­nal record is an ac­cepted ag­gra­vat­ing fac­tor in law.</p>
    <p>But the sen­tenc­ing process does not end there – how much harsher should the sen­tence for A be? Sup­pose the ap­pro­pri­ate pun­ish­ment for B is one month’s jail, how much longer should A’s jail term be? Put an­other way, what would be a fair pun­ish­ment for A?</p>
    <p>The an­swer is far from straight­for­ward. It de­pends on a range of other sub-fac­tors. For ex­am­ple, how long ago was A’s pre­vi­ous con­vic­tion? Was his pre­vi­ous of­fence a sim­i­lar of­fence or a very dif­fer­ent one? What steps has A taken to re­duce the risk of re­of­fend­ing since then? What pun­ish­ment did A re­ceive for his pre­vi­ous of­fence?</p>
    <p>So what at first glance seems to be an easy ques­tion, turns out to be a lot more com­pli­cated. This ap­plies to vir­tu­ally ev­ery sen­tenc­ing case and ev­ery ag­gra­vat­ing and mit­i­gat­ing fac­tor, be­cause as high­lighted above, no two cases are ever ex­actly alike. On oc­ca­sion, the rel­e­vant sen­tenc­ing fac­tors may also pull in dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, the Court of Ap­peal, our apex court in Sin­ga­pore, ex­plained in 2016 that “sen­tenc­ing is an in­tensely dif­fi­cult ex­er­cise, and that rea­son­able per­sons can, and of­ten do, dis­agree as to what the ap­pro­pri­ate sen­tence ought to be. That is why a wide mar­gin of ap­pre­ci­a­tion is given to sen­tenc­ing judges called on to ex­er­cise their dis­cre­tion”.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond broad point, which should not come as a sur­prise con­sid­er­ing the above, is how much of rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion we have about a case, as well as how close the con­text we are to an ac­tual sen­tenc­ing judge, can sig­nif­i­cantly af­fect what we feel should be the fair pun­ish­ment in any given case.</p>
    <p>There is em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence on this. The Mel­bourne Crim­i­nol­ogy Sen­tenc­ing Study, which was com­pleted in 2007, in­volved four ac­tual judges each pre­sent­ing a real-life case to about 100 par­tic­i­pants. The 400 or so par­tic­i­pants were se­lected so that there was good rep­re­sen­ta­tion in terms of age, gen­der, oc­cu­pa­tional sta­tus and so on. The judges spent around 40 to 55 min­utes ex­plain­ing the details of the case to the par­tic­i­pants, which in­cluded the facts of the of­fence, the cir­cum­stances of the of­fender as well as the rel­e­vance of the dif­fer­ent sen­tenc­ing fac­tors.</p>
    <p>The judges then in­formed par­tic­i­pants that they were con­sult­ing the com­mu­nity and asked each par­tic­i­pant to in­di­vid­u­ally and anony­mously in­di­cate what sen­tence the par­tic­i­pant would im­pose. The par­tic­i­pants were also told that each case in­volved a real of­fender who had to serve the sen­tence im­posed and a real vic­tim who had been harmed.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing into ac­count pre­vi­ous stud­ies done else­where, the re­sults of the Mel­bourne study sug­gested that the amount of rel­e­vant in­for­ma­tion a per­son has about a case, and how close a con­text he or she is in com­pared with an ac­tual sen­tenc­ing judge, makes a dif­fer­ence to what one thinks would be a fair and just pun­ish­ment. More­over, the study also found that the pun­ish­ment the par­tic­i­pants said they would im­pose turned out to be gen­er­ally less harsh than what the judges in the cases in fact meted out.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ingly, try­ing to come to a po­si­tion on whether a sen­tence passed in a case is fair and just when one pos­sesses bits and pieces of in­for­ma­tion about the case is not un­like a doc­tor de­cid­ing what med­i­cal pro­ce­dure to or­der for a pa­tient after the doc­tor has heard only one or two symp­toms de­scribed by the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>All this segues very nicely to the third and fi­nal as­pect, which re­lates to how much we know about the court’s reasoning in pass­ing a par­tic­u­lar sen­tence on an of­fender in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Our Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code pro­vides that when our courts de­liver judg­ment, and this in­cludes a judg­ment on sen­tence, the court can do so ei­ther orally or by writ­ten grounds of de­ci­sion. In prac­tice, writ­ten grounds of de­ci­sion would set out the court’s reasoning in its full de­tail. Oral judg­ments are by and large briefer, and may not touch on ev­ery sin­gle rel­e­vant point.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as a mat­ter of prac­tice as well, the State Courts will gen­er­ally is­sue writ­ten grounds in a case only when ei­ther the pros­e­cu­tion or the ac­cused has filed an ap­peal against the judg­ment. This is rightly so, given the heavy caseload that the State Courts have to man­age ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>As the Court of Ap­peal al­luded to in a 2011 case, re­quir­ing courts to is­sue de­tailed writ­ten judg­ments in ev­ery case may in­crease costs and lead to de­lays. Only in a rel­a­tively small num­ber of cases do ei­ther party see a need to ap­peal. Ad­di­tion­ally, in many cases, the court’s reasoning would al­ready be ob­vi­ous from the ex­changes be­tween the court and the par­ties. All this means that very un­der­stand­ably, the ma­jor­ity of sen­tenc­ing de­ci­sions would be ren­dered by our courts only orally.</p>
    <p>And each year, thou­sands of ac­cused per­sons are sen­tenced by our courts. The me­dia can re­port on only a small frac­tion of them. Fur­ther­more, if ren­dered as a writ­ten judg­ment, a court’s reasoning for why it passed a par­tic­u­lar sen­tence would fre­quently run up to dozens of pages, some­times hun­dreds.</p>
    <p>But the space that any me­dia can ded­i­cate to re­port­ing on a sen­tenc­ing case is nec­es­sar­ily far more lim­ited, so what is re­ported would in­vari­ably be noth­ing more than a snap­shot of the court’s reasoning, and what it took or did not take into ac­count.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly as well, just be­cause a fact about the of­fence or the of­fender was men­tioned by the pros­e­cu­tion or the de­fence in the case does not mean that the court took it into ac­count or gave it much weight in its de­ci­sion on sen­tenc­ing. Very of­ten, par­ties high­light cer­tain facts merely to pro­vide the court with a more com­plete pic­ture of the case and the of­fender.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, de­fence coun­sel reg­u­larly point out on be­half of the client the hard­ships that the client’s fam­ily might ex­pe­ri­ence if the client is sen­tenced to a jail term. This is of­ten picked up in news re­ports.</p>
    <p>But, for bet­ter or for worse, a court will al­most never ac­tu­ally fac­tor that into its sen­tenc­ing de­ci­sion be­cause it is es­tab­lished law since the 1990s that hard­ships to an of­fender’s next-of-kin is a mit­i­gat­ing fac­tor only in very ex­cep­tional cases.</p>
    <p>That said, there is much help­ful gen­eral in­for­ma­tion on sen­tenc­ing avail­able, such as that on com­mon ag­gra­vat­ing and mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors, and what dif­fer­ent sen­tenc­ing op­tions en­tail. These in­for­ma­tion can be found on the web­sites of our courts and the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ingly, try­ing to come to a po­si­tion on whether a sen­tence passed in a case is fair and just when one pos­sesses bits and pieces of in­for­ma­tion about the case is not un­like a doc­tor de­cid­ing what med­i­cal pro­ce­dure to or­der for a pa­tient after the doc­tor has heard only one or two symp­toms de­scribed by the pa­tient.</p>
