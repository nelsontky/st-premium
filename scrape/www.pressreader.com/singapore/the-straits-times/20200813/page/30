AIBotics Go-Digital Smart Cities Network chairman Tay Kok Chin, who will co-host the webinar with Mr Tian, adds, “Being smar t is subjective. It involves being people-centric with plans to adopt innovation­s according to the needs and aspiration­s of the business communitie­s and citizens.”
With the outbreak of Covid-19, one must now prioritise technologi­es that provide clean and healthy living conditions, enable essential ser vices, result in high-quality jobs and give access to learning opportunit­ies when building a smart city.
The webinar on Aug 20 will discuss how one can build a smart city for the future. It will include sessions on governance, smart retail and healthcare. Done in partnershi­p with global platform for thought leadership and business intelligen­ce Smart Cities Network, the three-hour session will feature Mr Tian, Mr Tay, and thought leaders from Japan, Indonesia and the Philippine­s.
AIBotics Go -Digital will run a series of webinars till November. It will also feature a 24/7 vir tual exhibition of the latest AI and robotics technologi­es. The event is organised by APAR A and Singapore Press Holdings’ wholly owned subsidiar y Sphere Exhibits. The second webinar of the AIBotics Go-Digital series on Aug 20 will focus on how businesses can use artificial intelligen­ce (AI) and robotics technologi­es to build smart cities.
A smart city is defined as one that improves the lives of its citizens with accurate informatio­n and public ser vices, as well as technologi­cal solutions to urban challenges such as poor air and water quality. A smart city covers areas like governance, infrastruc­ture, energy, healthcare and mobility, among others.
Globally, smart city projects to improve cars and watches have risen over the past five years. Mr Oliver Tian, honorar y advisor to the Asia Pacific Assisted Robotics Associatio­n (APARA), says such efforts use data and communicat­ions technology to enhance the quality of people’s lives.
He says: “Smart cities don’t just adopt new technology, they must make it work for people”, adding that one must leverage technology such as AI and robotics to augment human potential; after all, cities are built for people. Factors that should be considered in building smart cities include population demographi­cs, the level of user maturity in adopting technology, living patterns and lifestyles, education and sustainabi­lity.
