    <p>Some­times, a strug­gle can have beau­ti­ful re­sults.</p>
    <p>Just ask an oys­ter. It de­fends it­self from an in­vad­ing par­a­site by coat­ing it­self with lay­ers of a ma­te­rial called nacre. The oys­ter be­comes adap­tive and re­silient.</p>
    <p>In time, this process forms a lus­trous pearl, glow­ing and de­fi­ant.</p>
    <p>In a strange way, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic re­minds me of this mag­i­cal and in­domitable quest for sur­vival in na­ture.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 sneaked into our na­tion, un­in­vited and un­wel­come. It caused ma­jor catas­tro­phes that changed our lives. The dis­ease lifted the veil on hid­den vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties. But these grim re­al­i­ties on the ground can trans­late into op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The re­lent­less march of the coro­n­avirus was met by an equally de­ter­mined swell of em­pa­thy that lifted the na­tion. Em­pa­thy was man­i­fest in ac­tion by thou­sands of in­di­vid­u­als who self-or­gan­ised ef­forts to help the vul­ner­a­ble, and seen in gen­er­ous do­na­tions by or­gan­i­sa­tions and in un­prece­dented Bud­get sup­port by the state.</p>
    <p>When face masks be­came the cen­tral fo­cus in our fight against the dis­ease, or­gan­i­sa­tions both pub­lic and pri­vate stepped up to combat a po­ten­tial lack of sup­ply. There are now 1,200 24-hour vend­ing ma­chines across 800 lo­ca­tions to dis­pense masks to some five mil­lion Sin­ga­pore­ans and res­i­dents at the flash of an iden­tity card.</p>
    <p>It sounds sim­ple, but us­ing dis­pens­ing ma­chines to dis­trib­ute masks this way is com­pli­cated. Se­cu­rity, con­ve­nience and the sheer vol­ume of peo­ple col­lect­ing make the task chal­leng­ing. More im­por­tantly, the in­sight to de­liver masks via vend­ing ma­chines springs from an em­pa­thetic un­der­stand­ing of what a cus­tomer wants in a pan­demic sit­u­a­tion: a low-touch, yet re­li­able way to col­lect the masks with­out face-to-face con­tact, to re­duce transmissi­on risks.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore, this surge of em­pa­thy has an­other far-reach­ing value. Em­pa­thy can lead to in­no­va­tions for eco­nomic re­cov­ery, and give us rel­e­vance on the in­ter­na­tional stage.</p>
    <p>EM­PA­THY IN CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, our so­ci­ety has dis­played a strong, col­lec­tive fight­ing spirit through a height­ened sense of em­pa­thy at this time of na­tional cri­sis. It was not only Covid-19 that brought this out.</p>
    <p>Through­out our young his­tory, an em­pa­thetic re­sponse has been part of our arse­nal to meet crises. We have had to delve deep into our in­ter­nal faith – our con­fi­dence in des­tiny – through many years of over­com­ing pain in our his­tory.</p>
    <p>There was the sep­a­ra­tion from Malaysia af­ter the merger, the Bri­tish army’s with­drawal in 1971, the oil cri­sis in 1973, Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome), the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis and then the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, and the im­pact of the Sept 11 ter­ror at­tacks.</p>
    <p>To­gether, we have built, and are build­ing, a na­tion. We have kept the covenant made by our found­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew that we will be “one united peo­ple, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage or re­li­gion”. This is our duty of care to one an­other.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pan­demic, there are many sto­ries about how we have gone above and be­yond this duty, and ex­tended ser­vice to our neigh­bours. These are promis­ing and pow­er­ful en­er­gies of em­pa­thy stir­ring in our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>EM­PA­THY IN OUR COM­MU­NITY Sin­ga­pore’s nacre, our mother-of-pearl cas­ing, is em­pa­thy. It is the sub­stance that bonds us, keeps us rel­e­vant and turns us into a shin­ing so­ci­ety in a gloomy world.</p>
    <p>The pages of news­pa­pers and so­cial me­dia are brim­ming with sto­ries about in­di­vid­u­als who stepped up to re­spond to needs from the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Chad Tan vol­un­teered to carry bags full of lunch pack­ets, dis­tribut­ing them to low-in­come fam­i­lies and el­derly res­i­dents liv­ing alone. He felt com­pelled to do this be­cause he learnt that the num­ber of peo­ple need­ing help had dou­bled.</p>
    <p>To help keep Bangladesh­i com­pa­tri­ots in­formed, Mr Omar Faruque Shipon be­came an in­for­ma­tion am­bas­sador for the mi­grant work­ers. He set up a Face­book page, now 54,000 fol­low­ers strong, to act as a hot­line, help­ing mi­grant work­ers with queries and is­sues.</p>
    <p>Project Sta­ble Sta­ples was an ini­tia­tive by eight young peo­ple look­ing to pro­vide three months’ worth of gro­cery vouch­ers to fam­i­lies liv­ing in rental flats who have ex­pe­ri­enced a loss in in­come. The project has since helped al­most 3,000 in­di­vid­u­als and raised more than $160,000.</p>
    <p>There are many more such sto­ries of em­pa­thetic re­sponses by in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>AN EM­PA­THETIC ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore grap­ples with a new re­al­ity of muted ac­tiv­ity as a re­sult of Covid-19, we can tap the same em­pa­thetic en­er­gies to blaze new path­ways.</p>
    <p>In fact, there is even an em­pa­thy in­dex, de­vel­oped by Em­pa­thy Busi­ness, that in 2016 found that com­pa­nies that em­bed em­pa­thy – the abil­ity to un­der­stand and share the feel­ings of oth­ers – into their busi­ness mod­els per­form far bet­ter than those that don’t.</p>
    <p>Just last month, an ar­ti­cle on www.forbes.com re­ported: “A re­cent Ip­sos poll, con­ducted on be­half of Pep­siCo Bev­er­ages North Amer­ica, finds that Amer­i­cans be­lieve it is now more crit­i­cal than ever that brands demon­strate em­pa­thetic qual­i­ties and take ac­tion to main­tain cus­tomer loy­alty and sup­port. In re­sponse, com­pa­nies have de­scribed em­pa­thy as the ‘brand man­date’ from this point for­ward.”</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle goes on to de­scribe what em­pa­thy is in busi­ness terms: “Em­pa­thy is about per­spec­tive-tak­ing; it’s about walk­ing in your cus­tomers’ shoes to un­der­stand their ex­pe­ri­ence and how we can bet­ter help them solve prob­lems in their lives. But let’s be clear, brands aren’t em­pa­thetic; the peo­ple who man­age the brands have to be em­pa­thetic.”</p>
    <p>If you want to suc­ceed, em­pa­thy needs to be at the core of your busi­ness.</p>
    <p>This re­la­tion­ship be­tween cor­po­rate em­pa­thy and the abil­ity to in­no­vate can­not be de­nied. Sta­tis­tics show that four out of the top five most em­pa­thetic com­pa­nies glob­ally spent more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.4 bil­lion) on re­search and de­vel­op­ment in 2015.</p>
    <p>EM­PA­THY RE­NEWS REL­E­VANCE</p>
    <p>Em­pa­thy can also un­der­gird our at­tempts to stay rel­e­vant to the world.</p>
    <p>Over the past few months, as</p>
    <p>Covid-19 rav­aged the globe, we have seen coun­tries re­treat­ing into their na­tion­al­ist core.</p>
    <p>I am re­minded of my time as Sin­ga­pore’s first rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the Asean In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Com­mis­sion on Hu­man Rights.</p>
    <p>Back then, I had ex­pressed my con­cern about the need to bal­ance the en­joy­ment of hu­man rights and fun­da­men­tal free­doms with cor­re­spond­ing neighbourl­y and so­ci­etal du­ties and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. This was es­pe­cially so in an Asean set­ting where na­tion­al­ism was strong.</p>
    <p>I sought to un­der­stand if we each had a com­mon core of be­liefs in hu­man rights and be­liefs in the con­text of our re­spec­tive na­tions’ his­to­ries. This was in­ten­tional em­pa­thy. It was diplo­matic work and in­for­ma­tion gath­er­ing and shar­ing with open­ness and hon­esty.</p>
    <p>To­day, as a na­tion, we stand in sol­i­dar­ity with our re­gional neigh­bours, find­ing new ways to be use­ful for our col­lec­tive well-be­ing. We read­ily pro­vided them with masks, test kits and med­i­cal equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has opened its doors even wider to sup­port its neigh­bour­ing com­mu­ni­ties as well as the re­gional and global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>We are led by our shared val­ues of help­ing one an­other, even more so in times of cri­sis as our fates are for­ever in­ter­twined by deep per­sonal and na­tional his­to­ries. No one is safe un­til ev­ery­one is safe.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore­ans have strength­ened our foun­da­tion as a so­ci­ety, through our many em­pa­thetic re­sponses. This is ob­serv­able from the ini­tia­tives started by in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Each coun­try will emerge from its shell into a new world char­ac­terised by new con­structs. While many things are re­freshed and re­booted, one ax­iom re­mains cen­tral for Sin­ga­pore: that our sur­vival hinges on stay­ing rel­e­vant to the global com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Em­pa­thy can lead to in­no­va­tion. Ac­cord­ing to Mi­crosoft chief ex­ec­u­tive Satya Nadella, the source of in­no­va­tion is “all about be­ing able to meet the un­met and unar­tic­u­lated needs of cus­tomers”. To do this suc­cess­fully, you need to have em­pa­thy. If we can per­form this as a na­tion, we have a chance of keep­ing rel­e­vant in a world of dis­rup­tion and un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>In his na­tional broad­cast re­cently, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong lauded the re­silience and sol­i­dar­ity that Sin­ga­pore­ans have shown in these dif­fi­cult months: “They show we can emerge stronger from the cri­sis, with a sharper con­scious­ness of be­ing Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Let us put on the pearls of unity, re­silience and for­ti­tude, and be­gin the long jour­ney ahead, to­gether.</p>
