    <p>PORT­LAND • Pro­test­ers lit fires, threw rocks and smashed win­dows at county govern­ment of­fices in the US city of Port­land on Tues­day, prompt­ing the po­lice to de­clare a riot, after weeks of mostly peace­ful anti-racism demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers, some wear­ing gas masks and car­ry­ing shields, lit fires in dump­sters and used lighter fuel to start a fire in­side the Mult­nomah Build­ing big enough to set off the sprin­kler sys­tem, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>TV footage showed de­bris on the street in flames and peo­ple throw­ing stones at the build­ing. The fire in the build­ing was put out by po­lice.</p>
    <p>Black Lives Mat­ter protests have been held across the United States in re­cent months after the May 25 death of African-Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd, 46, who died after a white po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck for nearly nine min­utes.</p>
    <p>Protests, in­clud­ing in Port­land, have at times erupted into ar­son and vi­o­lence, and of­fi­cers sent into the North­west­ern city have re­peat­edly clashed with crowds tar­get­ing the fed­eral court­house there.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said some of­fi­cers were tar­geted a night ear­lier with a “pow­er­ful green laser” ca­pa­ble of caus­ing per­ma­nent eye dam­age when some pro­test­ers marched on the Port­land Po­lice As­so­ci­a­tion build­ing.</p>
    <p>“Port­land Po­lice has de­clared the gath­er­ing near the Mult­nomah Build­ing a riot after in­di­vid­u­als van­dalised, re­peat­edly smashed first floor win­dows with rocks and threw burn­ing ma­te­rial into an of­fice,” the Mult­nomah County Sher­iff’s Of­fice said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said some crowd con­trol “mu­ni­tions” were used to dis­perse the pro­test­ers, but no tear gas.</p>
    <p>Mult­nomah county chair Deb­o­rah Kafoury re­leased a state­ment at mid­night, say­ing a small group of pro­test­ers had set fire to the Of­fice of Com­mu­nity In­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>“This is the heart of our county, where peo­ple in our com­mu­nity come to get mar­ried, get their pass­ports, and cel­e­brate their cul­tural tra­di­tions and di­ver­sity,” the Ore­go­nian web­site quoted her as say­ing, adding that the space is ded­i­cated to com­mu­nity mem­bers that had been “marginalis­ed by the tra­di­tional po­lit­i­cal process”.</p>
    <p>Po­lice yes­ter­day said an of­fi­cer was mildly in­jured and that there had been two ar­rests, one on charges of ri­ot­ing, un­law­ful use of a weapon and as­sault­ing a public safety of­fi­cer, and an­other on charges of crim­i­nal mis­chief and reck­less en­dan­ger­ing.</p>
    <p>US At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr came un­der fire from Demo­cratic law­mak­ers ear­lier this month for send­ing fed­eral of­fi­cers to dis­perse pro­test­ers in the city.</p>
    <p>Re­pub­li­can Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Graham on Tues­day called for the Depart­ment of Jus­tice to pros­e­cute a group of peo­ple caught on video­tape beat­ing and kick­ing a man who crashed his truck near protests in Port­land.</p>
