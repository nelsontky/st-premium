    <p>To boost early warn­ing against in­fec­tious dis­ease out­breaks, Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) camps could in the fu­ture be equipped to do on-site test­ing of un­well ser­vice­men, in­clud­ing for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This project by the DSO Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries, Sin­ga­pore’s largest de­fence re­search and de­vel­op­ment or­gan­i­sa­tion, is among the ways it looks to guard against the next in­fec­tious dis­ease out­break, even while the coun­try is still fight­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>DSO sci­en­tists told The Straits Times that while they were glad to con­trib­ute to pub­lic health ef­forts, the ul­ti­mate goal was to trans­late re­search into prac­ti­cal solutions that pre­vent SAF per­son­nel from be­ing in­fected, which would af­fect the SAF’s op­er­a­tional readi­ness and Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>DSO has sup­ported govern­ment ef­forts dur­ing this pan­demic by de­vel­op­ing test kits, re­search­ing po­ten­tial treat­ments and es­tab­lish­ing stan­dards for prod­ucts that do dis­in­fec­tion us­ing ul­tra­vi­o­let (UV) light.</p>
    <p>More than 50 sci­en­tists across the chem­i­cal and bi­o­log­i­cal de­fence pro­grammes at its De­fence Med­i­cal and En­vi­ron­men­tal Re­search In­sti­tute, which fo­cuses on build­ing up ca­pa­bil­i­ties to pro­tect against bi­o­log­i­cal and chem­i­cal agents, have been work­ing on these Covid-19 ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The project to test for a list of pathogens at med­i­cal cen­tres in</p>
    <p>SAF camps started a few years ago. It will utilise DSO’s di­rect-poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tech­nol­ogy, which is also be­hind a re­cently de­vel­oped Covid-19 test kit.</p>
    <p>To do the tests, a ba­sic lab­o­ra­tory set-up is still re­quired to an­a­lyse the sam­ples from ser­vice­men, but the process is sim­ple enough that na­tional ser­vice­men can be trained to han­dle it.</p>
    <p>“It is re­ally to bring the sur­veil­lance to the source so that we can de­tect any po­ten­tial out­break be­fore it es­ca­lates,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Boon Huan, 50, pro­gramme di­rec­tor for the DSO Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries’ bi­o­log­i­cal de­fence pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>An­nounced last month, the Res­o­lute 2.0 PCR test kit that was co-de­vel­oped with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search does not re­quire sam­ple pro­cess­ing and can be com­pleted in an hour, com­pared with a con­ven­tional PCR test, which takes 21/ hours or longer.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>An­other ef­fort to pre-empt fu­ture out­breaks is re­search into biomark­ers, which are mol­e­cules pro­duced by the hu­man body in re­sponse to an in­vad­ing pathogen. Dif­fer­ent types and amounts of biomark­ers may be pro­duced at dif­fer­ent stages of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>While it is not clear cur­rently if there are any biomark­ers that can be de­tected in the early stages of in­fec­tion, if they can be de­fined early, then a test­ing kit can be de­vel­oped to de­tect and iso­late in­fected per­son­nel be­fore the in­fec­tion de­vel­ops into a full-blown dis­ease that may spread quickly, added Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>To help Sin­ga­pore main­tain its test­ing ca­pac­ity even if there were to be a global short­age of crit­i­cal ma­te­ri­als used in test kits, DSO has also made its own serol­ogy test kit.</p>
    <p>This test uses an anti­gen reagent that is de­vel­oped i n-house to­gether with the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Prin­ci­pal sci­en­tist for the project Chen Hsiao Ying, 56, who pre­vi­ously worked on a test kit to de­tect the bio­chem­i­cal agent ricin in hu­mans, said: “You can think of us as pro­vid­ing a re­serve ca­pac­ity of serol­ogy tests, as we don’t want to be in a sit­u­a­tion where the coun­try is short on these tests.”</p>
    <p>The DSO’s Clin­i­cal Di­ag­nos­tic and Ser­vice Lab has tested more than 30,000 Covid-19 sam­ples since Fe­bru­ary – mostly from mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>To give front-line work­ers ad­di­tional peace of mind, the or­gan­i­sa­tion also de­vel­oped a UV light cabi­net that can kill more than 99.99 per cent of bac­te­ria and viruses it tested. It can dis­in­fect sur­gi­cal masks and other per­sonal be­long­ings in 15 min­utes, and was de­ployed at the Changi Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre fa­cil­ity in May.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tist Geral­dine Chee, 27, said the team is cur­rently work­ing on a way to test the ef­fec­tive­ness of prod­ucts – such as an au­ton­o­mous ro­bot – that use UV-C light to dis­in­fect sur­faces. They are us­ing a dosime­ter to mea­sure ra­di­a­tion and in­di­cate with dif­fer­ent colours whether a sur­face has been dis­in­fected.</p>
    <p>“We are re­search­ing to pro­vide a range of colour re­sponses, based on the or­gan­ism that is be­ing tar­geted by the UV dosage, such as Sars, in­fluenza or a fun­gus,” she said.</p>
    <p>DSO prin­ci­pal sci­en­tist Ayi Teck Choon, 56, who was be­hind the tech­nol­ogy for Res­o­lute test kits, said he was proud of the team for de­vel­op­ing the kits in less than three months, con­tribut­ing to the na­tional Covid-19 ef­fort.</p>
    <p>“It is not all the time that the re­search we work on be­comes a prod­uct. I feel Sin­ga­pore is an amaz­ing coun­try be­cause when there is a cri­sis, ev­ery­one comes to­gether and con­trib­utes, and I j ust feel very proud of ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>NIPPING OUT­BREAKS IN THE BUD</p>
    <p>It is re­ally to bring the sur­veil­lance to the source so that we can de­tect any po­ten­tial out­break be­fore it es­ca­lates.</p>
