    <p>The food and bev­er­age (F&B) in­dus­try re­mains gen­er­ally muted amid the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, but restau­rant chain House of Seafood has seen no­table growth over the past few months.</p>
    <p>Co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Fran­cis Ng told The Sun­day Times that sales have risen 20 per cent dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“We have seen an in­crease in take­away and de­liv­ery or­ders through food de­liv­ery apps, and we have also rolled out new ready-to-eat prod­ucts over the past few months,” Mr Ng said, adding that the chain has also ex­panded its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant’s third out­let, in</p>
    <p>Clarke Quay, opened last week, pushed back from June due to the im­pact of the pan­demic on F&B op­er­a­tions and ren­o­va­tion works. It has hired about 20 new work­ers over this pe­riod, bring­ing its head­count to about 100 across its out­lets.</p>
    <p>Most of the em­ploy­ees are Sin­ga­porean or per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs), with a hand­ful of for­eign work­ers who are trans­fers from other com­pa­nies, Mr Ng said.</p>
    <p>Hir­ing has al­ways been a chal­lenge in the F&B in­dus­try, Mr Ng added. He turned to so­cial me­dia to re­cruit for his new­est out­let, where the ma­jor­ity of work­ers</p>
    <p>are Sin­ga­pore­ans or PRs. In the past, the restau­rant used to rely on job por­tals for re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>House of Seafood has also been ex­plor­ing ways to re­duce its man­power needs. For ex­am­ple, it in­vested $50,000 in a kitchen man­age­ment sys­tem which al­lowed it to re­duce its kitchen staff by two.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem, which has also been im­ple­mented in the group’s two out­lets in China, is be­ing tried out at the chain’s Pung­gol restau­rant.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ing such tech­nolo­gies and new pro­cesses will also help to mit­i­gate labour shrink­age in the com­ing years,” Mr Ng said.</p>
