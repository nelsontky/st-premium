    <p>En­tre­pre­neur Deepa Asha Dewi had an un­ex­pected mis­ad­ven­ture in 2019: Wa­ter from heavy rain­fall seeped into her stall and dam­aged $12,000 worth of prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>But the 37-year-old did not give up then and nei­ther did she al­low the Covid-19 pan­demic to faze her last year, when she had to close her Lit­tle In­dia Ar­cade re­tail kiosk dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and could not re­plen­ish stock from over­seas for her com­pany Eggy Mag­icc Box.</p>
    <p>Ms Deepa, who started the Tamil learn­ing re­sources busi­ness in May 2018, has since de­cided to run it as an on­line-only store from her Hous­ing Board flat.</p>
    <p>“This is the best time to en­gage in an on­line or home busi­ness as... people are primed for on­line shop­ping,” said the mother of two boys, aged nine and five. Her hus­band is a fi­nan­cial plan­ner.</p>
    <p>She started mak­ing flash­cards for her el­der son when he started pri­mary school as she re­alised there was a dearth of fun and ed­u­ca­tional Tamil prod­ucts for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Armed with a $65 lam­i­nat­ing ma­chine and film, Ms Deepa made ad­di­tional sets to sell to rel­a­tives and on on­line mar­ket­place Carousell, of­ten work­ing from mid­night to 5am.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness took off with a $30,000 in­vest­ment from a friend, and Ms Deepa be­gan rent­ing the stall space in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>She has de­signed prod­ucts such as Tamil scrab­ble, wall vinyls and story cubes based on In­dian cul­ture and Singapore icons.</p>
    <p>She also sources T-shirts, bilin­gual books, games, tra­di­tional In­dian dolls and other nov­el­ties.</p>
    <p>All are avail­able on her Shopify web­store Tamil­withlove.</p>
    <p>“I want to make Tamil a cool thing. For chil­dren, if you see Tamil ev­ery­where, you get im­mersed in it, rather than just go­ing to Tamil class once a week,” said Ms Deepa. She is launch­ing Pun­jabi and Hindi prod­ucts next month and aims to have her prod­ucts sold in shops over­seas.</p>
    <p>Although Ms Deepa trained as a nurse and es­ti­mates she could make three times as much in that role, she finds her present work mean­ing­ful. Some cus­tomers have thanked her and told her that they have been in­spired to write books to help other chil­dren too, she said.</p>
    <p>“It feels good that other chil­dren are ben­e­fit­ing and other par­ents are com­ing up with ma­te­ri­als.” Joanna Seow</p>
