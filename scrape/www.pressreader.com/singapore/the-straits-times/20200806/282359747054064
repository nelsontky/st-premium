    <p>For the past six weeks, Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) foot­ballers have dili­gently trained day in, day out, even as a ques­tion mark hov­ers over whether they will play an­other com­pet­i­tive game this year.</p>
    <p>The league, which be­gan on Feb 29, was halted on March 24 due to the pan­demic. Teams re­turned to train­ing – al­beit in groups of five and with no con­tact al­lowed – in Phase Two from June 20 and with the Gov­ern­ment slowly eas­ing mea­sures in place to con­trol the spread of the coron­avirus, there is grow­ing hope that the SPL can re­sume soon.</p>
    <p>Tan­jong Pa­gar United de­fender Del­winder Singh said it would be a “big morale booster” not just for foot­ball. “At the end of the day, ev­ery­one wants to be able to go back to the way it was be­fore with­out re­stric­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes’ hopes have been raised with the grad­ual eas­ing of re­stric­tions in other sec­tors of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>From to­mor­row, 12 re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions will be al­lowed to hold wor­ship ser­vices with up to 100 peo­ple at a time, dou­ble the cur­rent limit of 50. The num­ber of at­ten­dees at wed­dings (up to 50 from 20) and fu­ner­als (up to 30 from 20) have also been in­creased in re­cent days. An­other pos­i­tive sign is that com­mu­nity cases have re­mained low in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Singh, 28, stressed that a cau­tious ap­proach was im­por­tant, cit­ing how Viet­nam re­sumed its do­mes­tic foot­ball league with no lim­its on fans in sta­di­ums, only to sus­pend it a sec­ond time af­ter a spike in cases.</p>
    <p>While Dr Leong Hoe Nam, in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal, would pre­fer to restart sports leagues and com­pe­ti­tions when there are zero un­linked com­mu­nity cases con­sis­tently for one to two weeks, he sug­gested any move to re­sume play first be done be­hind closed doors be­fore pro­gress­ing to quar­ter- and half-full are­nas while en­sur­ing nec­es­sary safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For Tampines Rovers head coach Gavin Lee, small, grad­ual steps are key. He said: “The next thing will be train­ing in larger groups be­fore full team train­ing and then com­pet­i­tive games.”</p>
    <p>Other sports here are equally hope­ful. Net­ball Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Cyrus Me­dora be­lieves his as­so­ci­a­tion can stage its eight-di­vi­sion Na­tional League, which is sched­uled for Sept 14-Nov 21, and has laid the ground­work for the com­pe­ti­tion to take place.</p>
    <p>“Based on spec­u­la­tion, maybe (the au­thor­i­ties) will re­lax the re­stric­tions a bit more by mid-Au­gust, and hope­fully, by Septem­ber, they will al­low court play to start,” he said.</p>
    <p>Not all sports as­so­ci­a­tions are as op­ti­mistic though. Sin­ga­pore Floor­ball As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Ken­neth Ho has al­ready braced him­self for a blank 2020 cal­en­dar. He said: “Safety of the play­ers and fans are of ut­most im­por­tance and if we can’t guar­an­tee (that), we may have to bite the bul­let and go with­out any com­pe­ti­tions.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Singa</p>
    <p>There is no sin­gle rule that gen­er­alises to ev­ery sport­ing event, and spe­cific con­sid­er­a­tions may be re­quired for dif­fer­ent sports and for dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories of events (train­ing ver­sus com­pe­ti­tions). pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, felt re­turn­ing to com­pet­i­tive sport was “an­other con­crete step to­wards nor­malcy” and “these events can­not be halted in</p>
    <p>Safety of the play­ers and fans are of ut­most im­por­tance and if we can’t guar­an­tee (that), we may have to bite the bul­let and go with­out any com­pe­ti­tions. def­i­nitely”. But he stressed “there is no sin­gle rule that gen­er­alises to ev­ery sport­ing event, and spe­cific con­sid­er­a­tions may be re­quired for dif­fer­ent sports and for dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories of events (train­ing ver­sus com­pe­ti­tions)”.</p>
    <p>As for Covid-19 test­ing, Dr Leong sug­gested this be done ev­ery two weeks and ide­ally timed one day be­fore the match while Prof Teo raised the ques­tion of costs.</p>
    <p>“Clearly if this can be borne by the ath­letes, fed­er­a­tions or spon­sors, then un­der­tak­ing reg­u­lar and rou­tine test­ing of the ath­letes will be a good ap­proach,” said Prof Teo. “I do not other­wise think it is ap­pro­pri­ate to rely on pub­lic fund­ing to pay for the costs of these tests.”</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately how well Sin­ga­pore moves back into nor­malcy, he said, de­pends on the coun­try’s gen­eral ap­proach.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion is not about the phys­i­cal con­tact be­tween play­ers – af­ter all we al­low groups of five to come to­gether for a meal and I think it is de­bat­able whether con­tact sports is nec­es­sar­ily at a higher risk than five peo­ple spend­ing an ex­tended time speak­ing and eat­ing to­gether in fairly close prox­im­ity,” Prof Teo noted. “What is im­por­tant is how to min­imise the chance that ath­letes par­tic­i­pat­ing in these con­tact sports are in­fected and will go on to in­fect other com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>“This thus comes back to the over­all strat­egy a coun­try has re­gard­ing the abil­ity to track down in­fected peo­ple, ac­tive and com­pre­hen­sive con­tact trac­ing, as well as to iso­late and quar­an­tine ex­posed con­tacts early. If the over­all strat­egy can be im­ple­mented and ex­e­cuted well, then we al­ready min­imise the risk that any­one par­tic­i­pat­ing in con­tact sports may be in­fected, and this as a whole keeps the over­all sport­ing com­mu­nity safe.”</p>
