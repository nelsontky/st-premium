    <p>The Night Sa­fari has wel­comed the lat­est ad­di­tion to its Malayan tapir fam­ily – its first male calf in close to a decade.</p>
    <p>The birth of Bin­tang, or “star” in Malay, was cap­tured in a video posted on Face­book by Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore last week.</p>
    <p>He is the 32nd calf to be born in the Night Sa­fari, and the first male since 2011. The last fe­male calf was born just over a year ago.</p>
    <p>Bin­tang’s birth on June 28 is the lat­est suc­cess in breed­ing the en­dan­gered species at the Night Sa­fari.</p>
    <p>At the start of the two-minute video, his mother, 11-year-old Sakti, had al­ready been in labour for 30 min­utes. Af­ter giv­ing birth to Bin­tang, she leaves for a while be­fore re­turn­ing to lick the calf, which weighed in at 10kg.</p>
    <p>The typ­i­cal ges­ta­tion pe­riod for tapirs is 13 months. Adult tapirs typ­i­cally weigh 250kg to 320kg.</p>
    <p>Like all Malayan tapir calves at birth, Bin­tang sports a dis­tinc­tive black coat with white spots and stripes – of­ten re­ferred to in jest as a black and white wa­ter­melon. The tapirs’ pat­terned coats en­able them to blend in well with the dap­pled for­est floor in their na­tive habi­tat in South-east Asia. Over the first six months, the pat­tern grad­u­ally trans­forms into the unique black and white mark­ing of adult tapirs – a pri­mar­ily black body with a patch of white ex­tend­ing from the shoul­ders to the rear end.</p>
    <p>Bin­tang still feeds on his mother’s milk and has just started to ex­plore solid foods such as veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee Tzu Ying, a ju­nior zookeeper at the Night Sa­fari, said: “Bin­tang took about three weeks to get used to wa­ter and learn how to swim, and he is an ac­tive calf which likes to run around while the keep­ers shower him.”</p>
    <p>Tapirs love the wa­ter and are adept swim­mers which of­ten seek refuge in the near­est body of wa­ter when pur­sued by preda­tors.</p>
    <p>Bin­tang is the 32nd calf to be born in the Night Sa­fari, and the first male since 2011... Bin­tang’s birth on June 28 is the lat­est suc­cess in breed­ing the en­dan­gered species at the Night Sa­fari.</p>
