    <p>Na­tional ser­vice­men will soon be able to tap ded­i­cated skills train­ing pro­grammes to help them nav­i­gate a weak job mar­ket and eco­nomic un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>This will be done through col­lab­o­ra­tions be­tween Safra, pub­lic agen­cies and ed­u­ca­tion providers, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for De­fence and Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are un­der way with Work­force Sin­ga­pore and Skill­sFu­ture to of­fer rel­e­vant up­skilling and train­ing pro­grammes through the na­tional ser­vice as­so­ci­a­tion’s plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“Given the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion with em­ploy­ment and the slow econ­omy, we think one area which many of our NS­men will ben­e­fit from is learn­ing,” said Mr Zaqy, who is pres­i­dent of Safra.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing to re­porters on the side­lines of the Lib­erty Safra Swim for Hope fi­nale at Safra Tampines, as he an­nounced Safra’s plans to bet­ter cater to na­tional ser­vice­men and their fam­i­lies over the next five years.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows a year-long strate­gic re­view that in­volved more than 1,400 na­tional ser­vice­men and vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant-Colonel (NS) Ter­ence Quek, chair­man of the re­view’s work­ing group and im­ple­men­ta­tion com­mit­tee, said par­tic­i­pants had high­lighted learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties as a way Safra could sup­port na­tional ser­vice­men, par­tic­u­larly those just em­bark­ing on their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>De­tails on the type and for­mat of these cour­ses as well as Safra’s wider plans are still be­ing worked out, he added.</p>
    <p>In line with the re­view, a wider range of fit­ness and well­ness of­fer­ings, such as mixed mar­tial arts, dance and aer­o­bics classes will be avail­able at Safra’s six club­houses, while gyms may also be set up be­yond the as­so­ci­a­tion’s com­pounds to pro­vide greater ac­cess to fit­ness op­tions.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter ad­dress­ing the health­care needs of na­tional ser­vice­men and strength­en­ing To­tal De­fence are among other plans.</p>
    <p>While some fit­ness plans have been de­layed by the pandemic, oth­ers, such as the launch of a mixed mar­tial arts gym at Safra Tampines, have gone ahead and proven pop­u­lar, Mr Zaqy noted.</p>
    <p>Safra’s re­cent part­ner­ship with Amore Fit­ness has also helped to ex­pand the as­so­ci­a­tion’s reach, such as among fe­male mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Safra said it is ex­plor­ing health­care-re­lated part­ner­ships that will of­fer mem­bers pref­er­en­tial rates for phys­io­ther­apy and med­i­cal screen­ing, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Di­a­logues on na­tional is­sues and more char­ity events are also on the cards to help sup­port To­tal De­fence, Safra said.</p>
    <p>A record 4,300 par­tic­i­pants, in­clud­ing na­tional ser­vice­men and their fam­i­lies, took part in this year’s vir­tual Swim for Hope event, which raised $166,600 for the Autism Re­source Cen­tre (Sin­ga­pore), Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion’s One Team Sin­ga­pore Fund and the SAF Care Fund.</p>
