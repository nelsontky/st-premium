    <p>ROME • The Vatican has con­firmed the pon­tiff’s re­marks on gay cou­ples de­serv­ing civil pro­tec­tions as it sent an ex­plana­tory note to bish­ops un­der­lin­ing that Pope Fran­cis’ com­ments did not mark a change in church doc­trine.</p>
    <p>The Pope’s re­marks made head­lines last month after they ap­peared in the doc­u­men­tary Francesco, at its Oct 21 pre­miere at the Rome Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>In the film, he re­it­er­ated his view that gay peo­ple are “chil­dren of God” and said: “What we have to cre­ate is a civil union law. That way they are legally cov­ered.”</p>
    <p>Last week, ac­knowl­edg­ing the “var­i­ous re­ac­tions and in­ter­pre­ta­tions” pro­voked by the Pope’s ap­par­ent break from his pre­de­ces­sors, the Vatican sec­re­tary of state sent an ex­plana­tory note to its nun­cios to be shared with bish­ops, “with the de­sire to favour an ap­pro­pri­ate un­der­stand­ing of the words of the Holy Fa­ther”.</p>
    <p>It said that dur­ing a 2019 in­ter­view, the Pope had an­swered two sep­a­rate ques­tions that in the doc­u­men­tary were “edited and pub­lished as a sin­gle an­swer with­out proper con­tex­tu­al­i­sa­tion, which has led to con­fu­sion”.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor of the film, Mr Evgeny Afi­neevsky, had told re­porters that the Pope had made the com­ments on civil unions di­rectly to him, but it emerged soon after that the com­ments had been made in a 2019 in­ter­view with Mex­i­can broad­caster Tele­visa.</p>
    <p>The pon­tiff’s com­ments on civil unions had been cut from that in­ter­view, but it is un­clear un­der whose or­ders the snip­ping took place.</p>
    <p>In its ex­plana­tory note, the Vatican said the Pope’s com­ments on civil union re­ferred to a po­si­tion he had taken when he had been arch­bishop of Buenos Aires and had strongly op­posed a 2010 law al­low­ing same-sex mar­riage. Ar­gentina was the first coun­try in Latin Amer­ica to le­galise same-sex mar­riage.</p>
    <p>In the Tele­visa in­ter­view, the Pope was asked whether his po­si­tion on same-sex mar­riage had soft­ened. He re­sponded that it was “an in­con­gru­ence to speak about gay mar­riage” for the Catholic Church, a com­ment that Mr Afi­neevsky cut.</p>
    <p>But the Vatican note said that dur­ing the in­ter­view, in speak­ing of the con­tro­versy in Ar­gentina, the Pope had ar­gued for the right of gay cou­ples to have le­gal pro­tec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Vatican note also pointed to a 2014 in­ter­view in which the Pope had re­it­er­ated that “mar­riage is be­tween a man and a woman” but that sec­u­lar states could seek to “jus­tify civil unions to reg­u­late var­i­ous sit­u­a­tions of co­ex­is­tence, driven by the de­mand to reg­u­late eco­nomic as­pects among peo­ple, such as en­sur­ing healthcare”.</p>
    <p>It is clear, the note said, that the Pope was re­fer­ring to sec­u­lar laws, “not cer­tainly the doc­trine of the Church, many times reaf­firmed over the years”.</p>
    <p>Pope Fran­cis’ com­ments con­flict with the Vatican’s of­fi­cial po­si­tion on same-sex civil unions. A 2003 doc­u­ment is­sued by the Con­gre­ga­tion of the Doc­trine of the Faith says that the Church’s “re­spect for ho­mo­sex­ual per­sons can­not lead in any way to ap­proval of ho­mo­sex­ual be­hav­iour or to le­gal recog­ni­tion of ho­mo­sex­ual unions”.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ment, which was signed by the then pre­fect of the con­gre­ga­tion, Car­di­nal Joseph Ratzinger, sought to sway Catholic law­mak­ers as an in­creas­ing num­ber of coun­tries sought to rat­ify le­gal rights for same-sex cou­ples.</p>
    <p>“Le­gal recog­ni­tion of ho­mo­sex­ual unions or plac­ing them on the same level as mar­riage would mean not only the ap­proval of de­viant be­hav­iour, with the con­se­quence of mak­ing it a model in present-day so­ci­ety, but would also ob­scure ba­sic val­ues which be­long to the com­mon in­her­i­tance of hu­man­ity,” the doc­u­ment says.</p>
