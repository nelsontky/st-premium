    <p>Sin­ga­pore man­u­fac­tur­ers and busi­ness groups have lauded a gov­ern­ment min­is­ter’s sug­ges­tion that lo­cal com­pa­nies be given a hand to scale up by help­ing them to se­cure pub­lic-sec­tor con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Win­ning such con­tracts will give these com­pa­nies, bat­tered by the eco­nomic fall­out from Covid-19, a bet­ter chance to tide over the tough times, they told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ful­fill­ing such con­tracts will also build up and strengthen their track record, which would help them com­pete in­ter­na­tion­ally, an out­come that will be par­tic­u­larly ben­e­fi­cial for start-ups and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), they added.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness groups and en­trepreneur­s were re­spond­ing to Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng’s sug­ges­tion that poli­cies can be bet­ter adapted to help lo­cal com­pa­nies emerge stronger from the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in a ra­dio in­ter­view last Wed­nes­day, Dr Tan, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, had said: “No par­tic­u­lar pol­icy can be that pre­cise. But I think we can bet­ter adapt, we can bet­ter tweak (poli­cies) to reach out to an ever-en­larg­ing group of en­trepreneur­s in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“In terms of gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment poli­cies, we can pro­vide them with a lift up, that pro­vides them with a form of cre­den­tial­ing.</p>
    <p>“Then, they can com­pete in­ter­na­tion­ally, hav­ing been cer­ti­fied and val­i­dated by the big gov­ern­mentlinked com­pa­nies here in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises pres­i­dent Kurt Wee said: “Some­times, star­tups have very re­fresh­ing or brand­new prod­ucts or ser­vices that they also need to prove to the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment can give them a leg-up in es­tab­lish­ing them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Chia Hock Lai said that an ex­ist­ing ac­cred­i­ta­tion pro­gramme by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity to help the Gov­ern­ment and large com­pa­nies iden­tify ven­dors has done well.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that sim­i­lar pro­grammes can be rolled out to cover more sec­tors.</p>
    <p>His as­so­ci­a­tion started a cre­den­tial­ing pro­gramme in April to help the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore iden­tify fin­tech start-ups for grants.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme took two to three weeks to roll out, given the press­ing need for fin­tech start-ups to qual­ify for help amid the Covid-19 down­turn, he added.</p>
    <p>So far, the as­so­ci­a­tion has cer­ti­fied about 440 out of 600 ap­pli­cants, who have had to pro­vide ev­i­dence of a tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tion, pri­mar­ily for fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­u­fac­tur­ing Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Dou­glas Foo said that help­ing lo­cal com­pa­nies se­cure gov­ern­ment con­tracts is use­ful as gov­ern­ment ten­ders are also ap­pro­pri­ately sized for SMEs to bid com­pet­i­tively for.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing fig­ures re­leased by the Fi­nance Min­istry in 2017, Mr Foo pointed out that nine in 10 gov­ern­ment con­tracts each year are less than $100,000 in value.</p>
    <p>And this has helped com­pa­nies here, he said, point­ing to how about 80 per cent of gov­ern­ment con­tracts are awarded to lo­cal SMEs.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo said the leg-up for com­pa­nies will al­lay anx­i­eties among man­u­fac­tur­ers who are af­fected by the lack of in­ter­na­tional travel and fac­ing un­cer­tainty in the fore­cast for new or­ders.</p>
    <p>He cited a re­cent sur­vey con­ducted by the fed­er­a­tion that found 81 per cent of re­spon­dents in­di­cat­ing their or­der books had shrunk from six months to two months.</p>
    <p>About 55 per cent have also high­lighted wor­ry­ing in­ven­tory buildup, he added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said that sys­temic help for SMEs to se­cure gov­ern­ment con­tracts is “def­i­nitely an ap­pro­pri­ate move”.</p>
    <p>“Many SMEs are of­ten i n a Catch-22 sit­u­a­tion as they need to build their track record be­fore stand­ing a chance to be se­lected – yet they can­not have any record un­less they have done some work be­fore,” said Prof Loh, who is also di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Gov­er­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“A de­fin­i­tive cri­te­rion that places a pre­mium on high-po­ten­tial lo­cal SMEs can be con­sciously in­cluded in the tender eval­u­a­tion process,” he added.</p>
    <p>GIV­ING THEM A LEG-UP</p>
    <p>Some­times, start-ups have very re­fresh­ing or brand-new prod­ucts or ser­vices that they also need to prove to the mar­ket. Gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment can give them a leg-up in es­tab­lish­ing them­selves.</p>
