    <p>For­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his wife had al­ready thought of dis­miss­ing Ms Parti Liyani by late 2015, and Madam Ng Lai Peng had re­peat­edly vis­ited the maid agency to re­view the biodata of new do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was fired on Oct 28, 2016 be­cause her re­place­ment be­came avail­able then.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam dis­closed this in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day to show Ms Parti’s dis­missal was not “sud­den”, as be­lieved by High Court judge Chan Seng Onn.</p>
    <p>In his min­is­te­rial state­ment, he said new ev­i­dence that emerged from investigat­ions after Jus­tice Chan’s de­ci­sion to ac­quit Ms Parti of theft was “quite dif­fer­ent” from the in­fer­ences the judge had made.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam em­pha­sised that the fresh ev­i­dence is untested in court, but said he was duty bound to go through the facts, which arose out of fur­ther investigat­ions into the Liews’ con­duct.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment on Sept 4, Jus­tice Chan found there was rea­son to be­lieve Mr Liew and his son Karl had an im­proper mo­tive for mak­ing the po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan con­cluded the Liews pre-emp­tively dis­missed Ms Parti on Oct 28, 2016 be­cause they knew she was un­happy about be­ing il­le­gally de­ployed to work at Mr Karl Liew’s home and his of­fice.</p>
    <p>The judge con­cluded that when she told mem­bers of the fam­ily – after she was fired – that she wanted to com­plain to the Man­power Min­istry (MOM), the Liews then filed the po­lice re­port to stop her from re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore to make the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan’s con­clu­sion on the Liews’ mo­tive rested on three planks: that Ms Parti’s dis­missal was “sud­den”; that she told two fam­ily mem­bers while pack­ing her be­long­ings that she wanted to com­plain to MOM; and that the po­lice re­port was made to pre­vent her from re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore to file a com­plaint.</p>
    <p>But Mr Shan­mugam said Ms Parti’s dis­missal was not sud­den.</p>
    <p>He said Mr Liew had been think­ing of fir­ing her for some time after sus­pect­ing her of theft, but Madam Ng did not make a firm de­ci­sion after look­ing for po­ten­tial re­place­ments in late 2015.</p>
    <p>After a spe­cially de­signed power bank from France he re­ceived in May 2016 went miss­ing, Mr Liew de­cided to fire her and in Septem­ber that year, Madam Ng chose a re­place­ment. The new maid ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore on Oct 25, 2016 and the fam­ily de­cided that Ms Parti would be dis­missed on Oct 28, said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond point cen­tred on what Ms Parti had said about her in­ten­tion to lodge a com­plaint with MOM after she was fired on Oct 28.</p>
    <p>What the maid said was that she wanted to com­plain about the short no­tice pe­riod, Mr Shan­mugam told the House. This was con­firmed by a maid agent who was present at the Liews’ house while she was pack­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>“(Ms Parti) did not say that she wanted to com­plain to MOM about any­thing else. As can be seen, this is quite dif­fer­ent from the in­fer­ence that the High Court had made.</p>
    <p>“But the High Court un­der­stand­ably went on the ba­sis of the ev­i­dence and the sub­mis­sions made to it. The High Court did not have the ben­e­fit of this ad­di­tional ev­i­dence. And as I have said, our pur­pose is not to re­open the High Court’s find­ings.”</p>
    <p>Fur­ther investigat­ions also re­vealed that the maid agents twice of­fered to help Ms Parti lodge an MOM com­plaint, but she de­clined.</p>
    <p>She lodged her com­plaint about il­le­gal de­ploy­ment after she was charged, he said.</p>
    <p>As for the third is­sue, Mr Shan­mugam pointed out that fil­ing a po­lice re­port would not stop Ms Parti from re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore to lodge a com­plaint. “In­deed, in this case, it didn’t stop her from re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>While the High Court found that the rea­son for fil­ing the re­port was “cu­ri­ous”, Mr Liew had stated that he was do­ing so “for record pur­poses” be­cause he was wor­ried that Ms Parti’s boyfriends might break into their home.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said: “I put for­ward these points on the fil­ing of the po­lice re­port be­cause for our pur­poses, in this con­text, the ques­tion is not whether the High Court is right or wrong.</p>
    <p>“But rather, the ques­tion is: How did the po­lice and AGC pro­ceed? Is there any­thing so ob­vi­ously wrong about the fil­ing of the po­lice re­port that should have been ap­par­ent to the po­lice and AGC?</p>
    <p>“On the ma­te­rial be­fore them, did the po­lice and AGC have good rea­son to pro­ceed on the ba­sis that this was a rou­tine theft case? That is the cen­tral ques­tion.”</p>
