    <p>An adap­ta­tion of The Lit­tle Ny­onya was not me­dia and en­ter­tain­ment vet­eran Guo Jingyu’s ini­tial plan when he de­cided to film a Sin­ga­pore story for a China au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­ga­pore en­ter­tain­ment com­pany G.H.Y Cul­ture & Me­dia and Chi­nese tele­vi­sion di­rec­tor had bought the rights to adapt an­other iconic lo­cal drama, The Awak­en­ing (1984).</p>
    <p>But the 47-year-old was so drawn to the unique Per­anakan cul­ture in The Lit­tle Ny­onya that he de­cided to make its story first.</p>
    <p>The adap­ta­tion, which he pro­duced and is avail­able on iQiyi’s global stream­ing site, was a hit in China when it aired ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Fos­ter­ing an ex­change of sto­ries with Sin­ga­pore and other South­east Asian coun­tries is a fo­cus for Guo, whose com­pany is ex­pected to start trad­ing on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>He says in Man­darin dur­ing an in­ter­view with The Straits Times: “I’ve been work­ing in Chi­nese tele­vi­sion for more than 20 years. We are ex­pand­ing over­seas be­cause we want Chi­nese cul­ture to go global, and the strong Chi­nese di­as­pora around the world means Chi­nese sto­ries will have some res­o­nance with the over­seas au­di­ence.”</p>
    <p>The Bei­jing-based di­rec­tor was here for the Asia TV Fo­rum & Mar­ket ear­lier this month and to pre­pare for the ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>He will fo­cus on two types of con­tent – sto­ries about Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia made for the Chi­nese mar­ket; and sto­ries filmed in South-east Asia for au­di­ences in the re­gion. “I may even­tu­ally also ex­pand into non-Chi­nese-lan­guage con­tent,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The Lit­tle Ny­onya is the first in a three-part Nanyang se­ries tai­lored for the China mar­ket. Next in line are two orig­i­nal dra­mas – Sis­ter­hood, which re­cently be­gan film­ing in Malaysia – and Nanyang Trans­port Vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>A se­ries tar­geted at the Sin­ga­pore au­di­ence, The Fer­ry­man – Le­gends Of Nanyang, is also in the works.</p>
    <p>It reimag­ines iQiyi’s Chi­nese su­per­nat­u­ral Web drama Soul Ferry (2014 to 2016) in a Sin­ga­porean-Malaysian con­text. The drama, which airs next year, stars Qi Yuwu and Lawrence Wong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ac­tor Wong, an am­bas­sador of iQiyi, was also in the hit Chi­nese pe­riod drama Story Of Yanxi Palace (2018).</p>
    <p>The Fer­ry­man is iQiyi’s first Sin­ga­pore col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese video-stream­ing ser­vice an­nounced on Tues­day at the launch of its in­ter­na­tional head­quar­ters here that it is com­mit­ted to mak­ing more Sin­ga­pore shows and dis­tribut­ing them glob­ally by work­ing with lo­cal pro­duc­tion houses.</p>
    <p>Started in 2010, iQiyi has been de­scribed as the No. 2 player in China’s video-stream­ing mar­ket, with 104.8 mil­lion sub­scribers as of Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Guo says of work­ing with stars based in the re­gion such as Qi, Wong and vet­eran ac­tress Xiang Yun, who starred in both ver­sions of The Lit­tle Ny­onya: “They’re very pro­fes­sional. Good ac­tors are the same around the world.”</p>
    <p>But he laments a lack of up-and­com­ing young stars in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“In China, there are so many ac­tors and ac­tresses aged 18 to 25, and some start act­ing when they are 15. In Sin­ga­pore, you don’t see that very much.”</p>
    <p>He has plans to pur­sue artist man­age­ment here so he can dis­cover ac­tors and ac­tresses. He also hopes to sup­port ini­tia­tives that can help nur­ture off-screen tal­ents like di­rec­tors, screen­writ­ers and pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>He is also look­ing through nov­els writ­ten by lo­cal writ­ers for suit­able adap­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>He says: “The re­gion needs more pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies, artists and op­tions. The level of pro­duc­tion should also be raised. We can­not be fo­cused on cut­ting back bud­gets and con­trol­ling our purse strings to the point where we don’t even in­vest in build­ing sets, which are in­te­gral to film­ing.”</p>
    <p>G.H.Y Cul­ture & Me­dia has a film­ing base in Jo­hor, where there is a scaled-down recre­ation of Sin­ga­pore’s Chi­na­town. “Hope­fully, a film­ing base like that can be in Sin­ga­pore as well,” Guo adds.</p>
    <p>He will also ex­plore short-form se­ries with five- to 10-minute episodes – a project ex­pected to launch in China next year.</p>
    <p>“With the 5G era ahead of us, peo­ple will in­creas­ingly con­sume con­tent on their phones while they’re com­mut­ing or wait­ing in line. Short-form en­ter­tain­ment is some­thing to check out.”</p>
    <p>As for The Awak­en­ing – the orig­i­nal Sin­ga­pore story he had in mind – Guo has not given up on that.</p>
    <p>“I was sit­ting in my ho­tel room re­cently, look­ing at the Sin­ga­pore city view af­ter a heavy down­pour and it was all foggy,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I thought, ‘This is it, this is The Awak­en­ing (its Chi­nese name trans­lates lit­er­ally to ‘the fog en­velops Nanyang’)’.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it can be a story that tran­scends its time pe­riod and be more than one gen­er­a­tion’s story.”</p>
    <p>Two of the big­gest acts in the pop world – Amer­i­can singer-song­writer Tay­lor Swift and Puerto Ri­can rap­per-singer Bad Bunny – re­leased sur­prise al­bums re­cently.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Amer­i­can singer Mi­ley Cyrus ditches pop for rock in her al­bum Plas­tic Hearts, while Shawn Men­des taps the star power of fel­low Cana­dian Justin Bieber on his al­bum Won­der.</p>
    <p>Two al­ter­na­tive-rock stal­warts also have new of­fer­ings: Amer­i­can band The Smash­ing Pump­kins put out their 11th al­bum and Aus­tralian singer-song­writer Nick Cave goes solo on a live al­bum.</p>
    <p>Check out these re­leases on mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms such as Spotify and Ap­ple Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>1 POP WIL­LOW Tay­lor Swift</p>
    <p>Tay­lor Swift’s fairy tale-like mu­sic video for her new song Wil­low fea­tures a love in­ter­est played by Korean-Amer­i­can dancer Lee Tae-ok.</p>
    <p>It is not the first time the pair (both above) have worked to­gether – Lee was a dancer in Swift’s 2013 tour for her fourth al­bum Red.</p>
    <p>Wil­low is the first sin­gle from Ever­more, a sur­prise al­bum which Swift dropped last week. It is also the singer’s ninth al­bum.</p>
    <p>Swift di­rected the mu­sic video her­self – a se­quel to the one for Cardi­gan, a song from Folk­lore, an­other sur­prise al­bum she re­leased this year.</p>
    <p>2 LATIN TRAP/REGGAETON/ AL­TER­NA­TIVE ROCK EL ULTIMO TOUR DEL MUNDO Bad Bunny</p>
    <p>It has been a pro­lific year for Puerto Ri­can artist Bad Bunny, who has put out his third al­bum this year: El Ultimo Tour Del Mundo (Span­ish for “The Last Tour Of The World”). And there are no signs of fa­tigue from mu­sic fans. The sur­prise re­lease is the first fully Span­ish­language al­bum to hit No. 1 on the Bill­board charts.</p>
    <p>The singer and rap­per, who is also this year’s most played artist on mu­sic stream­ing ser­vice Spotify, has ex­panded his mu­si­cal pal­ette, mesh­ing his reggaeton and trap sounds with shades of al­ter­na­tive rock.</p>
    <p>“I al­ready had in­tended to come up with some­thing very dif­fer­ent, be­cause that’s what I am pas­sion­ate about,” he told mu­sic stream­ing ser­vice Ap­ple Mu­sic. “It’s about tak­ing risks and ful­fill­ing my wishes and dreams.”</p>
    <p>3 ELEC­TRONIC/PSY­CHE­DELIC POP WE WILL AL­WAYS LOVE YOU The Avalanches</p>
    <p>The third al­bum by Aus­tralian elec­tronic act The Avalanches comes four years af­ter their sopho­more record Wild­flower and two decades af­ter their de­but out­ing, Since I Left You.</p>
    <p>Like their pre­vi­ous re­leases, the songs here are metic­u­lously crafted from sam­ples taken from old vinyls such as folk vet­eran Vashti Bun­yan’s ob­scure 1970 de­but, Just An­other Di­a­mond Day.</p>
    <p>The duo of Rob­bie Chater and Tony Di Blasi also re­cruited col­lab­o­ra­tors such as trip-hop pioneer Tricky, Mick Jones from iconic punk group The Clash, Karen O from in­die-rock band Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Johnny Marr from in­die trail­blaz­ers The Smiths.</p>
    <p>4 AL­TER­NA­TIVE ROCK CYR The Smash­ing Pump­kins</p>
    <p>Cyr is the 11th al­bum by Grammy-win­ning Amer­i­can al­ter­na­tive-rock el­ders The Smash­ing Pump­kins.</p>
    <p>Like their pre­vi­ous record, Shiny And Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Fu­ture. No Sun. (2018), Cyr fea­tures three mu­si­cians from the band’s iconic 1990s line-up: front­man Billy Cor­gan, gui­tarist James Iha and drum­mer Jimmy Cham­ber­lin. Gui­tarist Jeff Schroeder joined the band in 2007.</p>
    <p>Cor­gan wrote a five-part an­i­mated se­ries ti­tled In Ashes, which serves as mu­sic videos for the al­bum.</p>
    <p>5 POP/ROCK PLAS­TIC HEARTS Mi­ley Cyrus</p>
    <p>Mi­ley Cyrus (above) started work­ing on her sev­enth al­bum two years ago, but lost all the ma­te­rial when her Mal­ibu house was de­stroyed in a wild­fire in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>“Just when I thought the body of work was fin­ished... it was all erased. In­clud­ing most of the mu­sic’s rel­e­vance,” she wrote on her web­site.</p>
    <p>She fi­nally re­leased the al­bum, Plas­tic Hearts, late last month. “Luck­ily, my col­lab­o­ra­tors still had most of the mu­sic that was burnt up in jour­nals and com­put­ers filled with songs for the EP se­ries I was work­ing on at the time,” she said.</p>
    <p>A de­vi­a­tion from Cyrus’ pre­vi­ous pop of­fer­ings, Plas­tic Hearts is what she de­scribes as her “rock record”. It fea­tures col­lab­o­ra­tions with rock vet­er­ans such as Joan Jett, Ste­vie Nicks and Billy Idol, as well as English pop singer Dua Lipa.</p>
    <p>6 POST-ROCK ODIN’S RAVEN MAGIC Sigur Ros</p>
    <p>Icelandic post-rock gi­ants Sigur Ros’ new al­bum is a live or­ches­tral per­for­mance that pre­miered in 2002.</p>
    <p>But only this month did the band re­lease the con­cert as an al­bum. The ver­sion here is taken from a 2004 per­for­mance in Paris.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic and the al­bum ti­tle are based on a 14th­cen­tury Icelandic poem, in which omi­nous signs fore­shad­ow­ing the end of the world ap­pear as the gods in Val­halla (a hall in Norse mythol­ogy ruled by the god Odin) feast at a ban­quet.</p>
    <p>The work is a col­lab­o­ra­tion with Icelandic artists such as elec­tronic mu­si­cian Hil­mar Orn Hil­mars­son and mu­si­cian-com­poser Maria Huld Markan Sig­fus­dot­tir.</p>
    <p>7 AL­TER­NA­TIVE ROCK ID­IOT PRAYER: NICK CAVE ALONE AT ALEXAN­DRA PALACE Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds</p>
    <p>This live al­bum that ac­com­pa­nies a con­cert film of the same name fea­tures Aus­tralian singer-song­writer Nick Cave play­ing a solo set in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The film was orig­i­nally re­leased as a one-time tick­eted on­line stream in July, but was later aired in the­atres and re­leased as a live al­bum last month.</p>
    <p>Filmed in one take by cin­e­matog­ra­pher Rob­bie Ryan, the per­for­mance was meant to re­place the band’s live shows, which were cancelled due to the pan­demic. In it, Cave plays stripped-down ver­sions of songs from his band’s past al­bums, as well as new song Eu­thana­sia.</p>
    <p>8 POP WON­DER Shawn Men­des</p>
    <p>Cana­dian pop star Shawn Men­des, 22, has marked a mile­stone with Won­der, his fourth con­sec­u­tive re­lease to top the Bill­board al­bum charts.</p>
    <p>He joins king of rock ’n’ roll Elvis Pres­ley and fel­low Cana­dian star Justin Bieber as the only male acts to achieve the feat by the age of 22.</p>
    <p>In­ci­den­tally, the al­bum’s sec­ond sin­gle, Mon­ster, is a duet be­tween Men­des and Bieber.</p>
    <p>The Grammy-nom­i­nated singer has also re­leased a doc­u­men­tary ac­com­pa­ny­ing the al­bum, Shawn Men­des: In Won­der, on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>9 HIP-HOP NIGHT­MARE VA­CA­TION Rico Nasty</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can rap­per Rico Nasty has fi­nally re­leased her first al­bum, six years af­ter she made her record­ing de­but in 2014 with a mix­tape.</p>
    <p>“I feel like this al­bum proved to me that no mat­ter what I’m go­ing through, I can still make pow­er­ful mu­sic,” she says.</p>
    <p>“All of these songs that I ever made were al­ways about power, al­ways about mak­ing you feel pow­er­ful.”</p>
    <p>The hard-hit­ting al­bum fea­tures col­lab­o­ra­tions with other rap­pers such as Gucci Mane and Don To­liver, who both ap­pear on the track Don’t Like Me.</p>
    <p>10 AL­TER­NA­TIVE HIP-HOP MAN ON THE MOON III: THE CHO­SEN Kid Cudi</p>
    <p>The sev­enth stu­dio al­bum by Amer­i­can rap­per Kid Cudi is also the last in his Man On The Moon tril­ogy.</p>
    <p>Like the pre­vi­ous two – Man On The Moon: The End Of Day (2009) and Man On The Moon II: The Le­gend Of Mr Rager (2010) – the new al­bum is di­vided into four parts: Act I: Re­turn 2 Mad­ness; Act II: The Rager, The Men­ace; Act III: Heart Of Rose Gold; and Act IV: Pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The lyrics tell the story of how the rap­per has to fight to save him­self from his evil al­ter ego, Mr Rager.</p>
