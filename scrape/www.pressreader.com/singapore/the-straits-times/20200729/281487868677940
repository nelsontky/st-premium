    <p>A Maserati driver whose car dragged a po­lice of­fi­cer for more than 100m along Be­dok Reser­voir Road in 2017 was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to four years and seven months’ jail with a life­time driv­ing ban.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Ng Peng Hong, who said that Lee Cheng Yan’s of­fences “war­ranted a re­tribu­tive and de­ter­rent sen­tence”, also or­dered him to pay a fine of $3,700.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber last year af­ter a five­day trial, the judge found Lee, now 36, guilty of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing griev­ous hurt to the po­lice­man, Staff Sergeant Khair­u­lan­war Abd Ka­har, 26.</p>
    <p>Judge Ng had also con­victed Lee of nine other charges, in­clud­ing fail­ing to stop af­ter the ac­ci­dent and ob­struc­tion of jus­tice. An­other 59 pend­ing charges re­lated to mat­ters, in­clud­ing un­law­ful gam­bling ac­tiv­i­ties, will be dealt with at a later date.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Prose­cu­tor Senthilku­maran Saba­p­a­thy had urged Judge Ng to sen­tence Lee to four years and nine months’ jail with a life­time driv­ing ban. He said Staff Sgt Khair­u­lan­war suf­fered in­juries that had a last­ing im­pact and had lower back pain when car­ry­ing heavy items.</p>
    <p>De­fence lawyer S. Bala­mu­ru­gan, how­ever, pleaded for a sen­tence of not more than two years’ jail, with a “high fine” and an “ap­pro­pri­ate but not ex­ces­sive” pe­riod of driv­ing dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion. He said: “The ac­cused also suf­fers from in­som­nia, and as a re­sult, re­lies heav­ily on al­co­hol and sleep­ing pills to sleep even though (they) may be harm­ful to his health.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, the court had ear­lier heard that Lee, who owned the Maserati, drove the car on Nov 17, 2017, de­spite be­ing dis­qual­i­fied ow­ing to ear­lier traf­fic of­fences.</p>
    <p>Staff Sgt Khair­u­lan­war stopped Lee’s white Maserati in Be­dok Reser­voir Road at about 9.20pm, as Lee was not us­ing his seat belt.</p>
    <p>The po­lice­man parked his mo­tor­cy­cle in front of the Maserati be­fore dis­mount­ing. He then ap­proached the car to speak to Lee, who wound down his win­dow.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Prose­cu­tor Ti­motheus Koh had ear­lier said Lee “fled the scene by sud­denly rev­ers­ing the Maserati, be­fore ac­cel­er­at­ing quickly for­ward while the vic­tim was stand­ing next to the dri­verseat door”.</p>
    <p>Lee drove at between 79kmh and 84kmh, drag­ging Staff Sgt Khair­u­lan­war for more than 100m be­fore he fell onto the road. The Maserati then sped off, the court heard.</p>
    <p>DPP Koh said that af­ter the ac­ci­dent, Lee aban­doned the Maserati in Wil­low Av­enue near Alju­nied Road.</p>
    <p>Lee later phoned a friend, mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive Jeff Chan, telling him he was in­volved in an “in­ci­dent” with the Traf­fic Po­lice. Lee then went to Mr Chan’s flat. Po­lice turned up at Mr Chan’s home at around 2am on Nov 18, 2017. Of­fi­cers ar­rested Lee, who was charged in court later.</p>
    <p>Lee, how­ever, tes­ti­fied dur­ing the trial that he was not the driver of the Maserati when the ac­ci­dent took place. He said that about two hours be­fore the ac­ci­dent, he had given the car keys to a man known only as “Kelvin”, whom he had known for about five months.</p>
    <p>The court heard that nei­ther Kelvin’s sur­name nor ad­dress was given by Lee to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer han­dling the case.</p>
    <p>DPP Senthilku­maran then ques­tioned the ex­is­tence of Kelvin and told Lee: “You are ob­vi­ously ly­ing.”</p>
    <p>Lee in­sisted he was telling the truth. Yes­ter­day, Mr Bala­mu­ru­gan told the court Lee in­tends to appeal against his con­vic­tion and sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Ng Peng Hong, who said that Lee Cheng Yan’s of­fences “war­ranted a re­tribu­tive and de­ter­rent sen­tence”, also or­dered him to pay a fine of $3,700.</p>
