    <p>LON­DON • Mikel Arteta said on Thurs­day Arse­nal’s pri­or­ity in the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow is to trim their bloated squad as he seeks to build on a mini-re­vival at the Premier League club.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners were able to off­load Emil­iano Martinez and Hen­rikh Mkhi­taryan in the sum­mer win­dow while Mat­teo Guen­douzi and Lu­cas Tor­reira de­parted on loan. They were fol­lowed by Saed Ko­lasinac, who on Thurs­day agreed to join Bun­desliga side Schalke for the rest of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ger­mans Me­sut Ozil and Shko­dran Mustafi – both have barely fea­tured this sea­son – are still at the Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The club have been linked with a l oan move for Real Madrid play­maker Isco but first of all tech­ni­cal di­rec­tor Edu will at­tempt to raise funds by mov­ing on those who are sur­plus to re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>“There are some play­ers that are go­ing to go on loan and go­ing to leave and that is the pri­or­ity at the mo­ment,” Arteta said ahead of to­day’s league trip to West Brom. “We can­not sus­tain the numbers that we have in cer­tain po­si­tions and we are look­ing to do that, and then we will see if we have the right op­por­tu­nity in the po­si­tions where we need some more help.”</p>
    <p>The pres­sure on Arteta has eased af­ter wins against Chelsea and Brighton lifted Arse­nal to 13th in the Premier League ta­ble fol­low­ing a mis­er­able run. Bukayo Saka, who starred i n t he 1-0 win at Brighton on Tues­day, is ex­pected to be fit against Sam Al­lardyce’s side.</p>
    <p>The teenager was forced off dur­ing the lat­ter stages of the vic­tory af­ter a strong chal­lenge, but should re­cover while David Luiz and Wil­lian, who both tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 ear­lier this week, may re­turn this week­end.</p>
    <p>Al­lardyce this week called for a “cir­cuit-breaker” in the Premier League as coro­n­avirus cases spike in Bri­tain but league bosses said the com­pe­ti­tion would con­tinue as planned.</p>
    <p>“We have shown the sys­tem is work­ing,” said Arteta. “In the last week or so some­thing has hap­pened. We will have more re­stric­tions and more tests to try to be as ef­fi­cient as we were be­fore and we will see, but it can work and we can carry on.”</p>
