    <p>Royal Dutch Shell’s pivot away from crude oil to­wards a low­car­bon slate of fu­els will cost Sin­ga­pore 500 jobs and halve the pro­cess­ing ca­pac­ity at Pu­lau Bukom in the next three years.</p>
    <p>Shell Sin­ga­pore said yes­ter­day that the 1,300-strong Bukom work­force will be cut to 1,100 by the end of next year and in an­other two years, it will be down­sized to 800.</p>
    <p>The re­duc­tion in crude re­fin­ing ca­pac­ity – down to 250,000 bar­rels a day from the cur­rent 500,000 – will be achieved at a faster pace, prob­a­bly in the next year or two, Ms Aw Kah Peng, chair­man of Shell Com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The re­struc­tur­ing at the 59-year-old Bukom site – the com­pany’s Asia-Pa­cific hub for in­te­grated fu­els and petro­chem­i­cals, and home to Sin­ga­pore’s first re­fin­ery – fol­lows Royal Dutch Shell’s an­nounce­ment in Septem­ber on some 9,000 job cuts world­wide.</p>
    <p>In the short term, the pay­roll cuts will help shore up the su­per­ma­jor’s fi­nances, which have been hit by the coro­n­avirus-driven col­lapse in de­mand and prices of crude oil.</p>
    <p>How­ever, grim in­dus­try fore­casts that oil con­sump­tion may never re­turn to lev­els seen be­fore the pan­demic have also prompted Shell to ac­cel­er­ate its plans to be­come a net-zero emis­sions en­ergy busi­ness by</p>
    <p>2050 or sooner.</p>
    <p>The plan – an­nounced in 2017 – en­tails a smaller and smarter re­fin­ing foot­print and a pivot to­wards serv­ing busi­nesses and sec­tors that are also net-zero emis­sions.</p>
    <p>The com­pany will con­sol­i­date its global re­fin­ing port­fo­lio into six en­ergy and chem­i­cals parks by 2025, down from the present 14. Bukom will be one of those six sites.</p>
    <p>Ms Aw said the tran­si­tion at Bukom, which in­cludes dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and au­to­ma­tion of its op­er­a­tions, has been planned in con­sul­ta­tion with all stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing the Gov­ern­ment and trade union.</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­nir­man Ab­dul Manaf, gen­eral sec­re­tary of Sin­ga­pore Shell Em­ploy­ees’ Union, said the union has been work­ing closely with the man­age­ment to ex­plore ways to help its af­fected mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“We are ap­pre­cia­tive that the man­age­ment con­sulted the union early, and there has been open and trans­par­ent com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween the union and the man­age­ment,” he said in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>He said that while the union’s pri­or­ity is to pro­tect jobs and en­sure that the process is fair, the trans­for­ma­tion at Bukom will im­pact some of its mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“We will spare no ef­fort in help­ing our mem­bers with job place­ment and to cope with the im­pend­ing changes,” he said.</p>
    <p>Shell is not the only oil ma­jor mak­ing big changes in a bid to with­stand the un­prece­dented dis­rup­tions to the oil in­dus­try caused by Covid-19. Most of its peers have made big spend­ing re­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>Exxon Mo­bil re­cently an­nounced it will slash its global work­force by 14,000. BP will cut 10,000 jobs world­wide, and Chevron 6,000.</p>
    <p>Even oil­field ser­vices com­pa­nies like Sch­lum­berger have joined the fray. The com­pany an­nounced a cut of 21,000 jobs glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Shell was the first oil ma­jor to pledge a re­fo­cus of its busi­ness away from crude re­fin­ing to mak­ing cleaner fu­els like liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas and bio­fu­els like ethanol, and de­vel­op­ing low-emis­sions power sources like so­lar en­ergy.</p>
    <p>But the crash in oil de­mand this year – es­ti­mated at around 10 per cent – has seen most su­per­ma­jors con­tem­plat­ing a move away from fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>Ms Aw said Shell re­alises that this is dif­fi­cult news and is in­form­ing its staff well ahead of time, with no change tak­ing place un­til at least a year from now.</p>
    <p>“The im­pacted em­ploy­ees will get a re­trench­ment pack­age that is above that which is pro­vided for by the tri­par­tite guide­lines,” she said.</p>
    <p>“This in­cludes a com­pre­hen­sive set of sup­port ini­tia­tives, for ex­am­ple, ex­tended in-pa­tient med­i­cal cov­er­age for up to a year fol­low­ing re­trench­ment, pro­fes­sional out­place­ment ser­vices and a learn­ing sub­sidy, where ap­pli­ca­ble.”</p>
    <p>Apart from pos­si­bly re­de­ploy­ing staff within the com­pany, Shell Sin­ga­pore will also work with ex­ter­nal part­ners, such as the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ e2i Job Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, to sup­port im­pacted em­ploy­ees in find­ing al­ter­na­tive em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Aw said: “These are never easy de­ci­sions, but the change is a nec­es­sary one to en­sure that Bukom re­mains com­pet­i­tive and that Shell in Sin­ga­pore stays re­silient in the en­ergy tran­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Other parts of Shell’s busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore, such as the chem­i­cal plant in Jurong, will re­main un­af­fected by the global re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>In fact, Ms Aw said new job op­por­tu­ni­ties may emerge in time as Shell’s tran­si­tion to the low-car­bon busi­ness picks up pace.</p>
