    <p>It may sound like a good way to help the econ­omy, but it could eas­ily be a dis­as­ter wait­ing to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) has an­nounced that it will al­low pi­lot “cruises to nowhere” from next month, with safety mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>This sounds fine, in the­ory. It’s true that Sin­ga­pore risks harm­ing its econ­omy if it does not re­turn to some form of nor­malcy. But when it comes to cruises, the risks may out­weigh po­ten­tial re­wards.</p>
    <p>Con­sider what cruises en­tail in the first place. Pas­sen­gers eat, they take part in ac­tiv­i­ties, and they gen­er­ally re­lax out­side of their cab­ins. Even ac­cept­ing that each cruise ship car­ries only half the num­ber of pas­sen­gers it can nor­mally ac­com­mo­date, it would still host more than 1,000 peo­ple over a pe­riod of days.</p>
    <p>One of the par­tic­i­pat­ing ships in the pi­lot project has a nor­mal ca­pac­ity of more than 3,300 and the other has a max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of 4,900. And that is with­out count­ing the crew.</p>
    <p>Those on board are sup­posed to wear masks. But we know that while masks do re­duce the trans­mis­sion rate, they do not com­pletely stop the coro­n­avirus from spread­ing. And pas­sen­gers will not be masked dur­ing meals.</p>
    <p>There is also the risk of trans­mit­ting the virus through com­mon sur­faces pas­sen­gers touch while they help them­selves to the food. And even if the food is served at the counter by crew, there are still many pos­si­ble con­tact points.</p>
    <p>Do you stop pas­sen­gers from touch­ing walls and handrails when they go for a stroll on deck? Or from talk­ing to one an­other when tak­ing part in ac­tiv­i­ties? There are just so many pos­si­bil­i­ties for Covid-19 trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>One might ar­gue that the same may be said of peo­ple in shop­ping malls or su­per­mar­kets. But they do not min­gle for sev­eral days. Nor are they stuck to­gether in an en­closed space, in­ter­act­ing through on-board ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple ex­cited or hav­ing a good time tend to talk louder, in­creas­ing the trans­mis­sion risk.</p>
    <p>Ex­pert opinion on the risks posed by such cruises is di­vided.</p>
    <p>Yes, it is im­por­tant to keep the econ­omy go­ing. And yes, many peo­ple here want to go on hol­i­day again. But the risk ap­pears too high. The out­come is uncer­tain – it could be ben­e­fi­cial or highly dam­ag­ing... the worst that could hap­pen – and there is no guar­an­tee that it won’t – is a ma­jor out­break that, if spread to the com­mu­nity by asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers, could bring more eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties to a halt.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a senior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, and Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme see the move as an­other step to­wards nor­mal­is­ing life here.</p>
    <p>“It’s not only about pri­ori­tis­ing the safest ac­tiv­i­ties; there is a bal­ance with so­cial and eco­nomic fac­tors,” said Prof Fisher.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi agreed that it is im­por­tant to bal­ance the risks against the liveli­hoods of many, adding: “It would be the same as any stay­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Asok Ku­rup, who chairs the Academy of Medicine’s Chap­ter of In­fec­tious Dis­ease Physi­cians, is more con­cerned that cruises usu­ally at­tract older peo­ple – who are more vul­ner­a­ble to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He said: “So­cial­is­ing is an­other rea­son older folks go for cruises, (play) mahjong, et cetera. The skew to­wards more el­derly pas­sen­gers in such set­tings, in pos­si­bly con­fined en­vi­ron­ments, means the need to be su­per vig­i­lant and have very thor­ough polic­ing of mea­sures.” How is that go­ing to hap­pen?</p>
    <p>The STB said the ships must have “mea­sures to dis­cour­age close con­tact and in­ter-min­gling be­tween groups”. Dis­cour­age, not pro­hibit.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple may in­ter­min­gle, gather and chat. Even if rules are laid out, they may be breached. Even if the crew take ac­tion against pay­ing pas­sen­gers, the dam­age may have been done.</p>
    <p>The web­site of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) in the United States – the worst-hit coun­try in the world – says: “Cruise ships pose a greater risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion than other set­tings” as they “are typ­i­cally more densely pop­u­lated than cities or most other liv­ing sit­u­a­tions”. It ad­vises Amer­i­cans to de­fer cruise travel.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, is also dead set against such cruises.</p>
    <p>He asked: “Are cruise ships the hill we want to die on?”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that there is no guar­an­tee that all pas­sen­gers are free from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A pas­sen­ger who gets in­fected the day be­fore board­ing “is al­most cer­tainly go­ing to test neg­a­tive on em­bark­ing”, said Prof Cook.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing in­cu­ba­tion, the per­son would test neg­a­tive – but could turn pos­i­tive in a day or two, in other words, dur­ing the cruise.</p>
    <p>Should an out­break re­sult, he warned, “we’ll need to be ready to han­dle the con­tact trac­ing and quar­an­tin­ing that would be nec­es­sary”.</p>
    <p>The CDC said there is also risk in “crew liv­ing and work­ing in close quar­ters in a par­tially en­closed en­vi­ron­ment where so­cial dis­tanc­ing may prove chal­leng­ing, even with a lim­ited num­ber of peo­ple on board”.</p>
    <p>Should a crew mem­ber be in­fected but be asymp­to­matic, it could “keep the virus cir­cu­lat­ing from one voy­age to the next”.</p>
    <p>The STB says it is al­low­ing such cruises “in line with the cal­i­brated re­sump­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Yes, it is im­por­tant to keep the econ­omy go­ing. And yes, many peo­ple here want to go on hol­i­day again. But the risk ap­pears too high. The out­come is uncer­tain – it could be ben­e­fi­cial or highly dam­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>In the best-case sce­nario, no trans­mis­sion oc­curs on board and ev­ery­one has a good time.</p>
    <p>But the worst that could hap­pen – and there is no guar­an­tee that it won’t – is a ma­jor out­break that, if spread to the com­mu­nity by asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers, could bring more eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties to a halt.</p>
    <p>Surely there are bet­ter ways to kick-start the econ­omy?</p>

        <p data-role="text">Quan&#xAD;tum of the Seas, seen here docked at&#xD;&#xA;Ma&#xAD;rina Bay Cruise Cen&#xAD;tre last year, is one of the ships al&#xAD;lowed in a pi&#xAD;lot &#x201C;cruise to nowhere&#x201D; from next month.
