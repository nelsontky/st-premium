    <p>Mar­ried for 45 years, the cou­ple have two daugh­ters and four grand­sons.</p>
    <p>Since re­tir­ing as a tech­ni­cian in 2018, Mr Jamaludin Othman has en­joyed meet­ing dif­fer­ent groups of friends ev­ery week­end.</p>
    <p>That came to a halt when the cir­cuit breaker was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>“I was very stressed in the begin­ning be­cause I could not meet up with my friends. I was stuck at home. It’s like my world col­lapsed. Luck­ily my daugh­ter taught me how to use video call, so I could call my friends,” said Mr Jamaludin.</p>
    <p>He also learnt how to use Zoom be­cause the Ara­bic class he at­tends had to go on­line.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily had to cel­e­brate Hari Raya to­gether over Zoom. Be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, their elder daugh­ter, who is mar­ried with four sons, would visit ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>Madam Rahmah, who is par­tially blind and has weak legs due to arthri­tis, said: “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, we still got to see them through video calls, but it was not the same with­out hugs and kisses.”</p>
    <p>She also lamented the fact that they had to miss four im­por­tant over­seas wed­dings of friends due to travel re­stric­tions.</p>
