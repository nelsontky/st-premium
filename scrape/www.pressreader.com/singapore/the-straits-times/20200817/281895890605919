    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • First, it was the prospect of wild­fires that took down large swathes of Cal­i­for­nia’s power grid. Now, it is the worst heat­wave in 70 years.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change is con­tribut­ing to in­creas­ingly ex­treme weather in Cal­i­for­nia. Less than a year ago, mil­lions of peo­ple were plunged into dark­ness in an ef­fort to keep power lines from spark­ing cat­a­strophic wild­fires.</p>
    <p>This time, dan­ger­ously high tem­per­a­tures are tax­ing the sys­tem, bring­ing about the state’s first rolling black­outs since the 2001 en­ergy cri­sis.</p>
    <p>What is more, they are hit­ting just as the pan­demic has trapped peo­ple in­doors in a state that has recorded more Covid-19 in­fec­tions than any other in the United States, leav­ing the pow­er­less with a dif­fi­cult choice be­tween en­dur­ing the heat in­doors and seek­ing re­lief else­where. It is the lat­est col­li­sion of wild weather and the pan­demic si­mul­ta­ne­ously wreak­ing havoc upon the world.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, Trop­i­cal Storm Isa­ias left mil­lions across the east­ern US without power for days, forc­ing re­mote work­ers into cof­fee shops and crowded park­ing spa­ces to ac­cess the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>For Cal­i­for­ni­ans, last Satur­day was the sec­ond night in a row that grid op­er­a­tor Cal­i­for­nia In­de­pen­dent Sys­tem Op­er­a­tor made the rare call to shut off power. An es­ti­mated 352,500 cus­tomers went dark – or roughly one mil­lion peo­ple, based on the av­er­age size of a house­hold.</p>
    <p>A day ear­lier, about two mil­lion peo­ple lost ser­vice over the course of four hours.</p>
    <p>“I’m pretty shocked by this – I think ev­ery­body is,” said Dr Michael Wara, di­rec­tor of the Cli­mate and En­ergy Pol­icy Pro­gramme at Stan­ford Uni­ver­sity. “This has to be ad­dressed with a lot of at­ten­tion, and fast.”</p>
    <p>Ex­treme weather fu­elled in part by cli­mate change has taken a pro­found toll on elec­tri­cal grids in re­cent weeks. Just days ago, mil­lions of peo­ple lost power across the US Mid­west after a wall of light­ning, hail and deadly winds tore a path of ruin from cen­tral Iowa to Chicago.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that, Trop­i­cal Storm Isa­ias had dark­ened homes from the Caroli­nas to Con­necti­cut.</p>
    <p>For Cal­i­for­nia, the prob­lem is heat. An un­re­lent­ing high-pres­sure sys­tem is push­ing tem­per­a­tures up­wards, leav­ing the re­gion fac­ing what is ex­pected to be its hottest two weeks in 70 years.</p>
    <p>That is driv­ing up power de­mand to ex­treme lev­els, mak­ing it harder for gen­er­at­ing plants to keep pace.</p>
    <p>Be­fore last Fri­day, Cal­i­for­nia had not im­posed rolling black­outs since the en­ergy cri­sis of 2001, when hun­dreds of thou­sands of cus­tomers took turns be­ing plunged into dark­ness, power prices surged to record lev­els and the state’s largest elec­tric util­ity went bank­rupt. It went bank­rupt a sec­ond time last year in the face of crip­pling wild­fire li­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The ro­tat­ing black­outs last Satur­day, par­tic­u­larly, took Cal­i­for­ni­ans by sur­prise. Less than an hour be­fore or­der­ing out­ages, the grid man­ager had said that black­outs would not be nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The abrupt and unan­nounced na­ture of the ro­tat­ing out­ages made the sit­u­a­tion es­pe­cially dis­rup­tive for those af­fected.</p>
    <p>Re­gions around the world have been grap­pling with ex­treme heat, in­clud­ing parts of Europe and the east­ern US, where tem­per­a­tures last month were ex­pected to set records for New York and Bos­ton.</p>
    <p>Last month tied for the world’s sec­ond-hottest July on record and the hottest ever in the North­ern Hemi­sphere, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Oceanic and At­mo­spheric Ad­min­is­tra­tion. But few au­thor­i­ties, if any, re­sorted to ro­tat­ing out­ages.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Weather Ser­vice has is­sued ex­ces­sive­heat warn­ings across Cal­i­for­nia un­til the end of Wednesday and is fore­cast­ing tem­per­a­tures as high as 45 deg C in some parts.</p>
    <p>“It will be a tad cooler on Sunday,” the agency said on Satur­day, but the heat was set to get worse from to­day to Wednesday.</p>
