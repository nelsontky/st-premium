    <p>An­nual leave that is unused is a sign of the times to­day. This guar­an­teed pe­riod of rest has been a sta­ple of or­gan­ised labour re­la­tions here, as it is in many other coun­tries. How­ever, the ex­i­gen­cies of ser­vice in many pro­duc­tive and com­pet­i­tive en­vi­ron­ments have of­ten re­sulted in sit­u­a­tions where em­ploy­ees are too pre­oc­cu­pied to con­sume all of their leave en­ti­tle­ment. Car­ry­ing over or en­cash­ing unused leave, where pos­si­ble, are equitable op­tions that some com­pa­nies al­low so their em­ploy­ees do not lose their en­ti­tle­ments. Such trends have been ex­ac­er­bated in th­ese un­usual times. With travel re­stric­tions in place and work­ing from home be­ing the de­fault for many com­pa­nies, many Sin­ga­pore­ans have been un­able to fully use up their leave this year. Yet the changed work en­vi­ron­ment, eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and dis­lo­ca­tion caused by Covid-19 have spawned wor­ries and pres­sures that make time­out from work an im­por­tant ne­ces­sity for them.</p>
    <p>For some en­ti­ties and com­pa­nies, the cur­rent times have also cre­ated a novel op­por­tu­nity to do good, ex­er­cise so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and show char­ity. This has in­cluded turn­ing unused leave into so­cial cap­i­tal by, for ex­am­ple, let­ting staff con­vert leave into cash for do­na­tion to char­i­ties and oth­ers in need. Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, for in­stance, an­nounced that its fac­ulty and staff do­nated more than $10 mil­lion worth of their unused leave to sup­port its stu­dents. The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore is also ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of al­low­ing staff to do­nate unused an­nual leave. Such ges­tures are com­mend­able be­cause they put those who are em­ployed in a po­si­tion to turn their un­con­sumed leisure into con­crete fi­nan­cial help for oth­ers to whom leisure might be the last thing on their minds in th­ese eco­nom­i­cally chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>Still, such ini­tia­tives war­rant care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion, and em­ployee sup­port. To be­gin with, not all com­pa­nies al­low leave en­cash­ment, thus leav­ing them out­side the purview of the ini­tia­tive – un­less they do­nate from their own pock­ets. For firms that do al­low con­ver­sion of leave to cash, the ques­tion then is in choos­ing char­i­ties and causes that em­ploy­ees would pre­fer. Even will­ing staff might oth­er­wise ask why they are forced to con­trib­ute to causes picked by cor­po­rate lead­ers and in which they have lit­tle or no say. Such con­cerns could be cir­cum­vented if em­ploy­ees are free to do­nate to their pre­ferred char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But most im­por­tant, turn­ing em­ploy­ees’ unused leave into do­na­tions should not be a means for em­ploy­ers to prove their so­cial cre­den­tials and cor­po­rate rep­u­ta­tions. An­nual paid leave ex­ists for a rea­son: for work-life bal­ance and to give em­ploy­ees respite. This is es­pe­cially sig­nif­i­cant in light of con­cerns about work­ers’ men­tal well­ness amid the pan­demic. They must re­main free to de­cide how they choose to use their time off.</p>
