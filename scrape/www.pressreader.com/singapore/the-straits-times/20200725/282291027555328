    <p>Mr Bidz­ina Ivan­ishvili, the big­gest vic­tim of a rogue trader at Credit Suisse Group, is su­ing one of the bank’s trusts in Sin­ga­pore for at least US$300 mil­lion (S$416 mil­lion), open­ing a fresh front in the long-run­ning dis­pute.</p>
    <p>The law­suit al­leges that the Credit Suisse trust “failed to act in good faith and in the best in­ter­ests of the ben­e­fi­cia­ries”, namely Mr Ivan­ishvili and his fam­ily, by ne­glect­ing to do proper due dili­gence on how their in­vest­ments were man­aged.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s top court paved the way for the law­suit ear­lier this month when it ruled that the citys­tate had ju­ris­dic­tion over the case.</p>
    <p>Credit Suisse has sought to limit court bat­tles over Pa­trice Lescau­dron, the bank’s for­mer star wealth man­ager, to Geneva where he was con­victed in 2018. Lescau­dron was sen­tenced to prison for forg­ing sig­na­tures and fak­ing trades to cover mount­ing losses of clients, in­clud­ing Mr Ivan­ishvili.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ivan­ishvili, a Ge­or­gian bil­lion­aire who made his for­tune in bank­ing and elec­tron­ics, as well as Lescau­dron’s other vic­tims have never ac­cepted that Lescau­dron could have kept his fraud alive for nearly a decade with­out help from in­side the bank. In their law­suit, the lawyers cite the trust’s own records show­ing its Mead­owsweet fund as hav­ing a value of US$307 mil­lion at the end of 2014, but then pre­sen­ta­tions from the bank show­ing it hav­ing jumped to US$439 mil­lion just three months later.</p>
    <p>The trust “ought to have be­come aware that the pre­sen­ta­tion was wrong” – and had the trust “alerted the plain­tiffs to the true in­vest­ment po­si­tion of the trust fund and/or bank’s mis­con­duct, the plain­tiffs would have taken steps to avoid or re­duce such losses”, Mr Ivan­ishvili’s lawyers said.</p>
    <p>Lescau­dron’s fraud was dis­cov­ered only in Septem­ber 2015 when Rap­tor Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals’ shares plunged. The French­man had built up a huge po­si­tion on the stock on be­half of Mr Ivan­ishvili, with­out the lat­ter’s knowl­edge. The stock plunge led to the Ge­or­gian get­ting mil­lions of dol­lars in mar­gin calls and Lescau­dron con­fess­ing four days later.</p>
    <p>The Credit Suisse Trust, a sub­sidiary of the Zurich-based bank, “in­tends to vig­or­ously con­test and de­fend the claims on the mer­its”.</p>
