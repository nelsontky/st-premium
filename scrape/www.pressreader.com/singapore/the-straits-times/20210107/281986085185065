    <p>It is with great sad­ness that I read of Mr Mah­mud Awang’s death on Mon­day in Mers­ing, Jo­hor. I have known him since I en­tered pol­i­tics in 1997. He stepped down from par­lia­men­tary pol­i­tics in 1968, but re­mained a mem­ber of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party, and would make his way down to the party con­ven­tion/con­fer­ence from his home in Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Mr Mah­mud would also be present at di­a­logues where re­tired PAP Malay MPs were in­vited, and was keen to share his ex­pe­ri­ences with new MPs.</p>
    <p>I have al­ways been in­trigued by the first gen­er­a­tion of PAP Malay MPs, be­cause of their will­ing­ness to be mem­bers of a party that was seen then by the Malay com­mu­nity as be­ing too Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>He and the oth­ers, such as the late Haji Yaa­cob Mo­hamed, Mr Rah­mat Ke­nap, Mr Buang Omar Ju­nid and Mr Mo­hamed Ariff Su­radi, came from a po­lit­i­cal back­ground like no other – they were all mem­bers of Umno but be­came dis­il­lu­sioned with the party and joined the PAP just be­fore the 1959 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>They came from the long line of Malays ac­tive both in pol­i­tics and the unions against the back­drop of colo­nial­ism and ris­ing Malay na­tion­al­ism. Among them, Mr Yaa­cob Mo­hamed be­came one of “Lee’s Lieu­tenants” and Mr Mah­mud be­came the first care­taker pres­i­dent of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress. This speaks vol­umes of the trust placed on him, given the sit­u­a­tion then of com­mu­nist in­fil­tra­tion of the unions.</p>
    <p>I am sure the trust placed on Mr Mah­mud and other Malays in the PAP must have given the Malay com­mu­nity a psy­cho­log­i­cal boost.</p>
    <p>In one ses­sion, I asked him about the by-elec­tion in An­son in 1961, which he lost to Mr David Mar­shall by only about 500 votes. He told me he had been asked to con­test the by-elec­tion and he pro­ceeded will­ingly. Such was his straight­for­ward nature, a qual­ity seen in his par­lia­men­tary de­bates.</p>
    <p>In the de­bate on the third read­ing of the Ad­min­is­tra­tion of Mus­lim Law Act in Au­gust 1966, a year af­ter Sin­ga­pore’s sep­a­ra­tion from Malaysia, Mr Mah­mud spoke in sup­port of the Bill and deftly put Umno (then present in Sin­ga­pore) at the re­ceiv­ing end of a barb on its ma­nip­u­la­tion of re­li­gion for po­lit­i­cal gains, un­like the PAP.</p>
    <p>This demon­strated his con­vic­tion in mul­tira­cial pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>He is per­haps the last of that gen­er­a­tion of Malays who threw their lot in with the PAP at a time when it was fash­ion­able to join other par­ties with a Malay agenda.</p>
    <p>My gen­er­a­tion of PAP Malay MPs are ben­e­fi­cia­ries of this older gen­er­a­tion’s con­vic­tion and com­mit­ment to mul­tira­cial­ism.</p>
    <p>We are grate­ful to them for mak­ing it pos­si­ble for other Malays to step for­ward and see pol­i­tics as an hon­ourable un­der­tak­ing.</p>
    <p>It is my wish that Mr Mah­mud and oth­ers of his gen­er­a­tion be seen in the same light as those in the found­ing fathers’ gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>I do not wish for a mon­u­ment, but per­haps a men­tion in the his­tory books of the role they played and their con­tri­bu­tions to build­ing mod­ern Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They de­serve to be seen as part of that con­stel­la­tion of men and women who be­lieved strongly in the idea of a mul­tira­cial Sin­ga­pore and worked tire­lessly at it.</p>
    <p>My gen­er­a­tion of PAP Malay MPs are ben­e­fi­cia­ries of this older gen­er­a­tion’s con­vic­tion and com­mit­ment to mul­tira­cial­ism.</p>
