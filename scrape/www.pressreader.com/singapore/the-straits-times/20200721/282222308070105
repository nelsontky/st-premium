    <p>(+21.06) July 20</p>
    <p>In­vestors had few leads to go on yes­ter­day with more un­cer­tainty over the pan­demic and the up­com­ing cor­po­rate re­port­ing sea­son.</p>
    <p>The sense of un­cer­tainty un­der­pinned a muted trad­ing per­for­mance, with the Straits Times In­dex (STI) clos­ing the day barely changed at 2,616.30, down 0.08 per cent or 2.18 points.</p>
    <p>Losers trumped gainers 238 to 213 with 1.44 bil­lion shares worth $982.6 mil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Oanda se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst Jef­frey Hal­ley had ex­pected Asia’s trad­ing ses­sion to be “char­ac­terised by in­vestors tak­ing some risk off the table, with a lack of data con­cen­trat­ing at­ten­tion on Covid-19 risks”.</p>
    <p>The STI’s ef­fort was in line with re­gional bench­marks, which posted rel­a­tively sub­dued num­bers.</p>
    <p>IG mar­ket strate­gist Pan Jingyi said: “Asia mar­kets are look­ing to a muted start to the week, caught between grow­ing Covid-19 cases around the globe while look­ing to the se­ries of earn­ings re­leases this week.”</p>
    <p>The top two STI con­stituent per­form­ers were As­cen­das Reit, up 1.2 per cent to $3.33, and Wilmar In­ter­na­tional, ahead also by 1.2 per cent to $4.35.</p>
    <p>The two coun­ters were also among the five STI con­stituents with con­sis­tent mo­men­tum in re­cent years, said the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The other three coun­ters were Ven­ture Cor­po­ra­tion, ahead 0.8 per cent, Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust, 0.3 per cent higher, and Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust, which closed the day flat.</p>
    <p>Th­ese five coun­ters av­er­aged 3 per cent re­turns for the first nine trad­ing ses­sions this month, and 11 per cent av­er­age to­tal re­turns so far this year, the SGX noted.</p>
    <p>At the bot­tom of the STI table was Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional, which ended at US$4.45, down 2.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Health­care and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal plays reg­is­tered heavy trad­ing with Medtecs In­ter­na­tional and Hy­phens Pharma In­ter­na­tional lead­ing the way. Medtecs added 17.6 per cent to 73.5 cents on trade of 93.4 mil­lion, while Hy­phens Pharma was up 48.8 per cent at 62.5 cents, with 66.2 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Hong Kong stocks fell but re­couped much of their losses, helped by ro­bust gains on the main­land. The Hang Seng closed down 0.12 per cent. Shang­hai shares closed 3.11 per cent higher af­ter reg­u­la­tors moved to bol­ster the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nikkei closed 0.09 per cent higher while South Korea’s Kospi dipped 0.14 per cent.</p>
