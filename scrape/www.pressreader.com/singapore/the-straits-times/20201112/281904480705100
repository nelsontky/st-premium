    <p>SEOUL • A drone taxi and drone de­liv­ery were tested in South Korea’s cap­i­tal yes­ter­day as the coun­try moves closer to l aunch­ing un­manned air ve­hi­cles by 2025.</p>
    <p>The event, near Seoul’s Han River, of­fered a glimpse into the fu­ture and what fly­ing ve­hi­cles might look like in a densely pop­u­lated city.</p>
    <p>South Korea is in­vest­ing about 24.5 bil­lion won (S$29.7 mil­lion) un­til end-2022 to de­velop the so­called K-Drone Sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tion in a quiet river­side park started with the flights of sev­eral small drones that are de­signed to mon­i­tor traf­fic con­di­tions and alert the drone op­er­a­tors to po­ten­tial dan­ger.</p>
    <p>A siren rang to sig­nal the all-clear be­fore a larger, two-seater drone, made by Chi­nese com­pany EHang, be­gan its take-off.</p>
    <p>No hu­man pas­sen­gers were on board the 5.6m-wide drone due to safety reg­u­la­tions. In­stead, it car­ried 70kg of bags of rice in its seats.</p>
    <p>The ve­hi­cle glided above the river for around 10 min­utes at a height of 36m and reached speeds of up to 50kmh.</p>
    <p>When the EHang 216 pas­sen­ger­grade auto aerial ve­hi­cle’s elec­tric bat­tery is fully charged, it can fly for as long as 30 min­utes, ac­cord­ing to Mr Bill Choi, EHang’s Asia busi­ness head.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s drones are al­ready in use in China for de­liv­er­ies, fire­fight­ing and some tourism pur­poses, he said.</p>
    <p>Fly­ing taxis and other au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles in the skies may sound like sci­ence fic­tion at the mo­ment, but they are pre­dicted to be big busi­ness one day.</p>
    <p>McKin­sey & Co es­ti­mates the po­ten­tial mar­ket size for drones could be US$46 bil­lion (S$62 bil­lion) in the United States alone by 2026.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, it could reach US$20 bil­lion by 2025, ac­cord­ing to a fore­cast by drone start-up Sky­Robot.</p>
    <p>South Korea es­ti­mates that its lo­cal mar­ket for aerial ve­hi­cles will be about 13 tril­lion won by 2040.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s event was part of a se­ries of tests of un­manned drone taxis and drone de­liv­er­ies aimed at eas­ing ur­ban traf­fic con­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, fly­ing cars will be con­trolled by a hu­man pi­lot on board and will look more like small he­li­copters, said deputy di­rec­tor Seo Jeong Seok of the depart­ment over­see­ing drones in South Korea’s Trans­port Min­istry.</p>
