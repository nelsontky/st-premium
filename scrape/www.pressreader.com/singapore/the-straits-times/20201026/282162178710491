    <p>In a dor­mi­tory room in Tuas that he shares with 14 other men, Mr Ashraf Ra­haman, 25, sits on his bunk bed, lis­ten­ing keenly to his lec­turer ex­plain the­o­ries of sta­tis­tics and dy­nam­ics.</p>
    <p>The scaf­fold­ing su­per­vi­sor is at­tend­ing his first on­line class for a diploma in me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing from Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>His In­ter­net con­nec­tion is un­sta­ble and the stream­ing gets cut off oc­ca­sion­ally but the hiccups do not dampen his en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>He over­comes these tech­ni­cal prob­lems by re­watch­ing the lec­tures, which are recorded, and ask­ing his class­mates for help.</p>
    <p>“This is my dream come true, to study while work­ing in Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Ashraf, who is learn­ing again af­ter fin­ish­ing high school i n Dhaka, Bangladesh, seven years ago. “Back home, there are not many op­por­tu­ni­ties to do both at the same time.”</p>
    <p>But these as­pi­ra­tions come with a hefty price tag.</p>
    <p>He will have to fork out a third of his $1,600 salary each month, adding up to more than $16,000 over the next 21/ years.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>To sup­port his ed­u­ca­tional pur­suits, his com­pany is still pay­ing him a full salary even though he will end work an hour ear­lier to at­tend classes three days a week.</p>
    <p>He joins a grow­ing list of mi­grant work­ers who have in­vested their salaries in cour­ses, diplo­mas and de­grees from var­i­ous in­sti­tutes in Sin­ga­pore. They say their stud­ies have paid off, and some earn up to four times more.</p>
    <p>Over the past year, pri­vate ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tute PSB Acad­emy has seen an in­crease in work per­mit hold­ers en­rolled in its cour­ses, from tech­ni­cal qual­i­fi­ca­tions to diplo­mas to de­grees.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said the trend is ex­pected to con­tinue this year.</p>
    <p>PSB Acad­emy grad­u­ate Faiz Ul­lah, 27, saw his monthly salary jump from $600 to $1,400 af­ter he com­pleted a diploma in elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing in 2017.</p>
    <p>The ship­yard elec­tri­cian from Chat­togram, Bangladesh, came to Sin­ga­pore in 2010. Af­ter ob­tain­ing his diploma, he was pro­moted from site su­per­vi­sor to as­sis­tant en­gi­neer. In his new job, he man­ages 15 work­ers who check and main­tain equip­ment.</p>
    <p>“I wanted my par­ents to feel proud that their son is ed­u­cated. We have good op­por­tu­ni­ties to study in Sin­ga­pore, so why not?” he said.</p>
    <p>TIME, SWEAT AND MONEY</p>
    <p>To earn their diplo­mas, work­ers such as Mr Faiz used to com­mit to a hec­tic rou­tine three times a week: leav­ing their work sites early and tak­ing public trans­port to their three-hour evening classes.</p>
    <p>They would re­turn to their dor­mi­to­ries only around mid­night as classes usu­ally ended at 10pm.</p>
    <p>“The first time I went back to the dorm af­ter class, I could not col­lect my uni­form from the laun­dry as ev­ery­one was asleep,” said Mr Faiz. “Some­times, by the time I reach the dor­mi­tory, there is no more rice to eat.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the dor­mi­tory lock­down, tak­ing their classes on­line gave work­ers more time to fo­cus on learn­ing, even though some said they still pre­fer phys­i­cal classes which give them more op­por­tu­ni­ties to clar­ify their doubts.</p>
    <p>Mr Ashraf, who be­gan his ed­u­ca­tion un­der these cir­cum­stances, suc­cess­fully got through his first se­mes­ter at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>Per­se­ver­ing with stud­ies also ben­e­fited Mr Ibrahim Khalil, 41, who spent three years to earn a diploma in con­struc­tion en­gi­neer­ing from BCA Acad­emy in 2018. It is the ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing arm of the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA).</p>
    <p>Once a con­struc­tion worker who mainly han­dled plas­ter and con­crete, Mr Ibrahim, from Cu­milla, Bangladesh, is now a tech­ni­cal of­fi­cer at in­fra­struc­ture con­sult­ing firm Sur­bana Jurong.</p>
    <p>His new higher pay en­abled him to up­grade his visa from a work per­mit to an S Pass last year. Af­ter a decade of stay­ing in dorms, he moved into a three-room flat in Jurong West that year, shar­ing it with four other work­ers, and could work from home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Now my next tar­get is to save money to set up my own small business back home,” he said, adding that it would fo­cus on con­sumer prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Mr Jaggupalli Venkateswa­rarao, 33, from In­dia, has a dif­fer­ent tar­get – he wants his wife and two sons to join him here.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is the best place to study so, at least for some years, I want to serve and give back to the coun­try by stay­ing on in the same job and con­tribut­ing my skills to the com­pany,” he said.</p>
    <p>The me­chan­i­cal in­tegrity in­spec­tor at Dow Chem­i­cal has spent al­most $70,000 on ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing since com­ing to Sin­ga­pore as a welder in 2006. This in­cludes a de­gree in me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and tech­ni­cal in­spec­tion cer­ti­fi­ca­tions from the Amer­i­can Petroleum In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>SUP­PORT­IVE EM­PLOY­ERS</p>
    <p>Mr Venkateswa­rarao said learn­ing would have been im­pos­si­ble with­out a sup­port­ive su­per­vi­sor who al­lowed him to leave work early to at­tend evening classes.</p>
    <p>His for­mer su­per­vi­sor, Mr Quek Hung Ling, 58, en­cour­ages work­ers to pur­sue fur­ther ed­u­ca­tion as he be­lieves those with am­bi­tion and a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude de­serve a chance at bet­ter jobs.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve in life­long learn­ing for ev­ery­one be­cause I was not highly ed­u­cated and I have ben­e­fited from adult ed­u­ca­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also be­lieves bet­ter-ed­u­cated work­ers per­form bet­ter at work, which in turn ben­e­fits em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Quek em­bod­ies his own phi­los­o­phy. He started off as a con­struc­tion worker 30 years ago, and is now a man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of his own firm, ProEn Scaf­fold.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the best place to study so, at least for some years, I want to serve and give back to the coun­try by stay­ing on in the same job and con­tribut­ing my skills to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>MR JAGGUPALLI VENKATESWA­RARAO, who wants his wife and two sons to join him here.</p>
