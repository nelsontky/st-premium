    <p>PALERMO • Al­most five months af­ter the ten­nis sea­son ground to a halt ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the WTA Tour restarted yes­ter­day with a low-key but closely mon­i­tored event in Palermo.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment in Sicily, which comes just weeks be­fore the US Open and Roland Gar­ros dou­ble­header, had lost top seed Si­mona Halep be­fore it started to lin­ger­ing health con­cerns while an un­named player with­drew from qual­i­fy­ing af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>When the Tour was sus­pended in March, the ten­nis cal­en­dar was shaken up­side down.</p>
    <p>The pres­ti­gious In­dian Wells event was the first com­pe­ti­tion to be axed. The French Open was then moved to late Septem­ber with</p>
    <p>Wim­ble­don can­celled for the first time since World War II.</p>
    <p>All elite ten­nis in China be­tween now and the end of the year has been scrapped, but the US Open sought to re­store a sem­blance of nor­mal­ity in June when it an­nounced that the Grand Slam would go ahead in its sched­uled time slot – al­beit with­out fans and un­der strict health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while the women have re­sumed their sea­son, the men must wait un­til the Western and South­ern Open – moved from its tra­di­tional Cincin­nati home to New York – be­gins on Aug 22, af­ter the tour­na­ment in Washington DC was called off.</p>
    <p>In the high­light of first-round matches in Palermo yes­ter­day, world No. 24 Donna Ve­kic of Croa­tia de­feated Dutch­woman Aran­txa Rus 6-1, 6-2.</p>
    <p>This week’s field will fea­ture play­ers ex­clu­sively from Europe and just three of the world’s top 20 – led by 15th-ranked Pe­tra Mar­tic, last year’s French Open run­ner-up Mar­keta Von­drousova and Greece’s Maria Sakkari.</p>
    <p>“The WTA has warned us that</p>
    <p>Of the top 20 ranked women’s play­ers are in the Palermo Open field. th­ese first two weeks are test tour­na­ments,” France’s world No. 174 Chloe Pa­quet told AFP, with com­pe­ti­tions lined up in Prague and Ken­tucky next week. “We know that if it goes well, there could be oth­ers. If it goes badly, the cal­en­dar could be re­viewed. We’re aware of that.”</p>
    <p>As ten­nis looks to rec­on­cile stag­ing top-level events dur­ing the on­go­ing pan­demic, play­ers will face reg­u­lar test­ing – start­ing upon their ar­rival in Palermo and re­peated every four days.</p>
    <p>Masks are re­quired aside from when play­ing or eat­ing while sup­port teams will be lim­ited to just one per­son, as the or­gan­is­ers at­tempt to limit con­tact be­tween play­ers and the out­side world to a min­i­mum.</p>
