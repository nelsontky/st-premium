    <p>KABUL • The Afghan govern­ment and the Tale­ban are “on the verge of peace talks” af­ter thou­sands of prom­i­nent Afghans ap­proved the con­tentious re­lease of about 400 mil­i­tant pris­on­ers, the head of Kabul’s peace coun­cil said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fate of the pris­on­ers has been a cru­cial hur­dle in launch­ing peace talks be­tween the two war­ring sides, which had com­mit­ted to com­plet­ing a pris­oner ex­change be­fore ne­go­ti­a­tions can start.</p>
    <p>The res­o­lu­tion was passed at the end of a three-day “loya jirga” – a tra­di­tional Afghan meet­ing of tribal el­ders and other stake­hold­ers held to de­cide on con­tro­ver­sial is­sues.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to re­move the hur­dles for the start of peace talks, stop­ping bloodshed and for the good of the public, the jirga ap­proves the re­lease of 400 pris­on­ers as de­manded by the Tale­ban,” jirga mem­ber Atefa Tayeb an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an of­fi­cial list, many of the in­mates are ac­cused of se­ri­ous of­fences, in­clud­ing at­tacks that killed scores of Afghans and for­eign­ers, with over 150 on death row.</p>
    <p>The jirga urged the govern­ment to give as­sur­ances that those re­leased will not be al­lowed to re­turn to the bat­tle­field, adding that for­eign fight­ers should be sent back to their coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It also de­manded a “se­ri­ous, im­me­di­ate and last­ing cease­fire”.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion of the loya jirga has re­moved the last ob­sta­cles... We are on the verge of peace talks,” said Mr Ab­dul­lah Ab­dul­lah, who is lead­ing the govern­ment’s peace process and was named head of the jirga.</p>
    <p>Afghan Pres­i­dent Ashraf Ghani said he would sign a de­cree to re­lease the pris­on­ers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The Tale­ban should now demon­strate that they are not afraid of a na­tion­wide cease­fire,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Afghan govern­ment has re­leased al­most 5,000 Tale­ban in­mates, but the au­thor­i­ties had baulked at free­ing the fi­nal pris­on­ers de­manded by the Tale­ban.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has pushed for the re­lease of the de­tainees, while recog­nis­ing the de­ci­sion would be “un­pop­u­lar”.</p>
