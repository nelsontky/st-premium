    <p>“The world is not what it was. So much has changed. I don’t have any so­lu­tions, and I don’t know if I will ever have any an­swers to ques­tions I have never asked my­self be­fore.”</p>
    <p>These are the ex­act words of a CEO client with whom I was con­duct­ing a coach­ing con­ver­sa­tion a few days ago. How does that make you feel, I asked?</p>
    <p>She thought about it for a while and then said two things.</p>
    <p>First of all she was feel­ing lost and com­pletely out of con­trol. “I don’t think I can get any ideas from all the Har­vard Busi­ness Re­view ar­ti­cles I keep read­ing.”</p>
    <p>She found this un­nerv­ing and it took her into un­known ter­ri­tory where she did not know how she was sup­posed to lead any more.</p>
    <p>I don’t think she was the only one feel­ing like this. The whole world is out there strug­gling to find new ways of adapt­ing to the chal­lenges that none of us had ever en­vis­aged.</p>
    <p>So even as we strug­gle, we should know: we are not alone.</p>
    <p>MAN­AG­ING COM­PLEX­ITY</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Rick Na­son, in his book It’s Not Com­pli­cated, says that if you man­age com­plex things as if they are merely com­pli­cated, you’re likely to be set­ting your busi­ness up for fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Com­pli­cated prob­lems can be hard to solve, but they are ad­dress­able with rules and recipes, and ex­perts who have solved these al­go­rithm-based prob­lems be­fore.</p>
    <p>They can also be re­solved with sys­tems and pro­cesses, like the hi­er­ar­chi­cal struc­ture that most com­pa­nies use to com­mand and con­trol em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the so­lu­tions and tools that help us fix dif­fi­cult prob­lems can­not deal with com­plex prob­lems. Com­plex prob­lems in­volve too many mov­ing parts, too many un­knowns and too many in­ter­re­lated fac­tors to re­duce to rules and pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Tried and tested meth­ods, work­ing longer hours or just harder, just can­not work where there are just too many un­knowns.</p>
    <p>Deal­ing with com­plex­ity re­quires a new way of think­ing.</p>
    <p>The past is a poor guide to the fu­ture, and as au­thor Charles Handy says, when we deal with am­bi­gu­ity and un­cer­tainty: “We need lead­ers who de­light in the un­known.”</p>
    <p>It was Pro­fes­sor Robert Kegan of Har­vard who high­lighted that when we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the world as too com­plex, we are not just ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the com­plex­ity of the world.</p>
    <p>We are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a mis­match be­tween the world’s com­plex­ity and the com­plex­ity of our think­ing.</p>
    <p>The struc­ture and com­plex­ity of our mind is not able to cope with the ex­ter­nal com­plex­ity, and so we are over­whelmed. Hence the great­est in­vest­ment we can make as lead­ers is to keep grow­ing our minds be­yond just abil­i­ties and skills, but through new ways of think­ing.</p>
    <p>Slow­ing down is the first step in nav­i­gat­ing the treach­er­ous wa­ters of the un­known.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers have to un­learn a great deal based on how they have led in the past. Dr David Drake, the founder of Nar­ra­tive Coach­ing (which takes a mind­ful and holis­tic ap­proach), asks lead­ers to rewind their sto­ries – what they have been telling them­selves, con­se­quently shap­ing the re­al­i­ties they ex­pe­ri­ence – based on the en­vi­ron­ment, their as­pi­ra­tions, mind­set and be­hav­iours.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, he asks them to check on the im­pact their sto­ries have on their iden­tity. Con­tin­u­ing to pro­tect iden­tity pre­vents them from devel­op­ing new sto­ries nec­es­sary to deal with com­plex times.</p>
    <p>The crit­i­cal skill needed is to no­tice how ex­ter­nal chal­lenges trig­ger their in­ter­nal self, their self-im­age and ev­ery­thing about them­selves that has made them suc­cess­ful in the past.</p>
    <p>IN­TER­NAL OP­ER­AT­ING SYS­TEMS</p>
    <p>To­day lead­ers need to change their in­ter­nal op­er­at­ing sys­tems. It was Robert An­der­son, au­thor of Mas­ter­ing Lead­er­ship, and founder of The Lead­er­ship Cir­cle process of as­sess­ing lead­er­ship ef­fec­tive­ness, who first in­tro­duced me to this con­cept.</p>
    <p>This is how, when busi­ness be­came more and more com­plex, the old DOS had to be re­placed with Win­dows, which it­self had to go on be­ing up­graded to deal with greater lev­els of com­plex­ity.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­nal op­er­at­ing sys­tem of lead­ers needs to keep evolv­ing, re­quir­ing bet­ter and more com­plex de­signs as the old self reaches its struc­tural lim­its. It is the struc­ture of mind that drives per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Hence, to achieve a higher struc­ture of mind, the leader has to be re­struc­tured. Deal­ing with com­plex­ity is es­sen­tially an in­ner jour­ney, re­quir­ing a new level of con­scious­ness, a new self, a new way of think­ing, so a new self can emerge.</p>
    <p>This is the time to ex­per­i­ment and learn, to get out of the prob­lem­fix­ing mode lead­ers are so used to and let the ac­tions emerge as you go along.</p>
    <p>Just try out stuff that you – or for that mat­ter oth­ers – have not tried be­fore. This is where it be­comes crit­i­cal to over­come fears and try not to op­er­ate from a mind­set of try­ing to re­solve ev­ery­thing. Tak­ing risk is in­trin­sic to this process.</p>
    <p>It re­quires a great deal of cu­rios­ity and no fear of fail­ure, or even the loss of sta­tus or power, or recog­ni­tion – purely per­form­ing ex­per­i­ments to see what de­vel­ops.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery coun­try is ap­proach­ing the Covid-19 virus in its own way and on its own terms. The price some of them have paid for it is im­mense, while some coun­tries have done re­ally well through dif­fer­ent forms of ex­per­i­ment­ing.</p>
    <p>EX­AM­PLES OF TRANS­FOR­MA­TION</p>
    <p>Three client com­pa­nies where I have helped trans­form the en­tire C-suite in the last few years have shown re­mark­able agility of thought dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An Aus­tralian com­pany that was a lead­ing sup­plier of tow­els and sheets to the ho­tel and hos­pi­tal in­dus­try, through var­i­ous team con­ver­sa­tions, fo­cused on its big­gest strengths. These were its trusted re­la­tion­ship with hos­pi­tals and its Chi­nese sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>The out­come was that it did many mul­ti­ples of mil­lions of dol­lars worth of busi­ness sup­ply­ing its hos­pi­tal clients with much-needed per­sonal pro­tec­tion equip­ment.</p>
    <p>It has made more money this quar­ter than in the “good” times, and has plans to sus­tain it.</p>
    <p>An In­dian com­pany man­u­fac­tur­ing ed­i­ble oil and the largest brand of hair oil de­vel­oped a new sup­ply chain us­ing food de­liv­ery com­pa­nies to sell its prod­ucts to cus­tomers us­ing its app.</p>
    <p>It also lever­aged on new tech­nol­ogy to help its deal­ers place or­ders di­rectly with sup­plies made through the si­mul­ta­ne­ous link with dis­trib­u­tors’ ware­houses. Si­mul­ta­ne­ously, it de­vel­oped a new prod­uct, of­fer­ing nat­u­ral dis­in­fec­tants to clean veg­eta­bles, al­to­gether gen­er­at­ing in­creased rev­enues and profits in these chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>The third, an Amer­i­can multi­na­tional food com­pany with its re­gional head­quar­ters in Sin­ga­pore, showed re­mark­able dex­ter­ity when, for un­for­tu­nate per­sonal rea­sons, its re­gional leader had to leave and it found it­self in the midst of a cri­sis. The hu­mil­ity, pas­sion and self­less mind­ful­ness with which each coun­try leader co­or­di­nated and pulled each other up to not let per­for­mance slacken, is a won­der­ful tes­ti­mony to their col­lec­tive higher or­der of con­scious­ness.</p>
    <p>MAK­ING BET­TER CHOICES</p>
    <p>The lead­er­ship “ask” has changed so much. Re­ac­tions are not the right re­sponse. It is the cre­ative struc­ture of mind that drives bet­ter choices. Lead­ers have to in­ten­tion­ally sup­port the de­vel­op­ment of greater com­plex­ity of mind through in­te­gra­tion of cog­ni­tive, emo­tional and be­havioural aspects of per­cep­tion and in­ter­pre­ta­tion to act in a dif­fer­ent man­ner.</p>
    <p>The usual ways of try­ing to man­age con­stant anx­i­ety does not lend it­self to man­ag­ing the changes needed in the men­tal make-up to deal with adap­tive chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Prof Kegan has also done work to help us un­der­stand the jour­ney of adult de­vel­op­ment, and the need to break through the thresh­old of the so­cialised mind op­er­at­ing with an ex­ter­nal lo­cus of con­trol, to a cre­ative mind that is self-au­thor­ing and built with a strong in­ter­nal lo­cus of con­trol.</p>
    <p>The great­est need for lead­ers to­day is to un­der­stand how to change them­selves, rein­vent them­selves, trans­form them­selves, and in­crease the com­plex­ity of thought in keep­ing with the ever-in­creas­ing com­plex­ity of our times.</p>
    <p>Clients usu­ally come to me be­cause they have be­come aware that what has worked for them in the past is not likely to work in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>They know that what used to be self-con­fi­dence has now be­come self-right­eous­ness, and a strong sense of iden­tity gets in the way of ac­cept­ing feed­back, and their own team has suc­cumbed to telling them what they want to hear.</p>
    <p>In fact, they have gath­ered “yes” men around them as they shy away from any po­ten­tial chal­lenge, and mis­place the need for agree­ment as the need for loy­alty.</p>
    <p>They have a strong de­sire for con­trol, al­though no­body can con­trol com­plex­ity, and they are aware they are trapped in a cause-ef­fect way of think­ing though they are now work­ing in a com­pletely un­pre­dictable space.</p>
    <p>They hunger for cer­tainty, driven by their delu­sion that they alone are re­spon­si­ble for their suc­cess.</p>
    <p>THE NEXT LEVEL</p>
    <p>New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern says that as leader, her job is to help ad­dress and re­duce the anx­i­eties of her peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This can hap­pen only if the leader fa­cil­i­tates the process of ex­plor­ing the minds of the peo­ple, along with the un­der­ly­ing as­sump­tions and be­liefs that drive their anx­i­eties.</p>
    <p>Prof Kegan says that anx­i­ety is the most im­por­tant pri­vate emo­tion in pub­lic life. What lim­its us is the sys­tem that we have de­vel­oped to con­stantly try and min­imise our anx­i­eties. Al­ter the as­sump­tions, the be­liefs and you can change be­hav­iours and help over­come fears about the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>If you want to take the or­gan­i­sa­tion to the next level, par­tic­u­larly in the midst of un­cer­tainty and am­bi­gu­ity, you have to in­flu­ence the think­ing process of your peo­ple.</p>
    <p>You have to change the very lan­guage they speak, and get them to ex­plore pos­si­bil­i­ties, tak­ing them to places they have not been be­fore</p>
    <p>A lot of this can be achieved through ask­ing a broad range of very dif­fer­ent ques­tions, rather than the typ­i­cal ques­tions most lead­ers use when try­ing to fix prob­lems.</p>
    <p>What are you will­ing to give up to get to where you need to be? Are you will­ing to shed the rock that you have been car­ry­ing for so long?</p>
    <p>What was go­ing on in your mind when you made this choice? What is your in­ner voice telling you now, what is your nar­ra­tive? What is it that you fear? What would we be do­ing dif­fer­ently if we look at this sit­u­a­tion a year from now? What kind of cul­ture would we have af­ter we have re­solved this is­sue? How would your iden­ti­ties change?</p>
    <p>I ask my clients how many times they sit around and have con­ver­sa­tions with­out an agenda, not to dis­cuss their work-re­lated is­sues but to re­flect to­gether and dis­cuss aspects that they have never done be­fore?</p>
    <p>This in­volves devel­op­ing new per­spec­tives, new ways of mak­ing mean­ing of what is devel­op­ing around them, cre­at­ing new ma­te­rial to learn from, and com­mit­ting to new ex­pe­ri­ences with­out any fear of fail­ure or re­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>These con­ver­sa­tions are not only crit­i­cal among one an­other, but also with them­selves.</p>
    <p>In­tro­spec­tion and deep re­flec­tion – search­ing for the in­ner con­scious­ness that will teach and in­form in a way that has not hap­pened be­fore. Learn­ing, then, is not of a re­ac­tive na­ture, not down­load­ing old habits of think­ing, and con­tin­u­ing to see what they al­ways have and are com­fort­able with.</p>
    <p>The re­flec­tion is not about old men­tal mod­els and old habits of thought and ac­tion, but at a deeper level to cre­ate aware­ness of how we in­ter­act with the world and all the com­pe­ten­cies that can de­velop from these in­ter­ac­tions, and how we can cre­ate an al­ter­nate fu­ture.</p>
    <p>This is an in­ner jour­ney, an ex­plo­ration of the emerg­ing re­al­ity and find­ing ways of be­ing in har­mony with the truth.</p>
    <p>And with deep lis­ten­ing, ad­dress the chal­lenge of an­swer­ing the ques­tion “What is the truth?” So many ver­sions of it ex­ists to­day.</p>
    <p>The so­cial me­dia scene and the as­so­ci­ated fake news have made it no longer easy to align your­self to the truth. There is no longer one truth, you just choose your ver­sion of the truth.</p>
    <p>We can­not work alone, but in an in­ter­de­pen­dent fash­ion, with our whole self, cross­ing ex­ist­ing bound­aries and em­brac­ing the phys­i­cal, emo­tional and eco­nomic pil­lars of the new lead­er­ship par­a­digm.</p>
    <p>Lead­er­ship is a jour­ney of con­stant de­vel­op­ment and self­change.</p>
    <p>To be com­fort­able with the un­known and pros­per will be­come the sin­gle big­gest com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage that lead­ers can give their or­gan­i­sa­tions. In the words of Mark Nepo, au­thor of The Book of Awak­en­ing: “Ul­ti­mately, prepa­ra­tion is more about be­ing cen­tred and present, rather than an­tic­i­pat­ing ev­ery pos­si­ble out­come.”</p>
    <p>• Pratap Nam­biar is the founder of Thought Per­fect Sin­ga­pore, help­ing CEOs en­hance lead­er­ship ef­fec­tive­ness through trans­for­ma­tional coach­ing.</p>
