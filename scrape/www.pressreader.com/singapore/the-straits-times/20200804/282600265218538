    <p>As Malaysia roils in the wake of its his­toric 2018 elec­tion, a man in green breaks into one of Kuala Lumpur’s old­est mosques, Masjid Jamek. He res­ur­rects the corpse of a mur­dered blog­ger, then van­ishes in a cloud of pi­geons.</p>
    <p>So be­gins Malaysian writer Joshua Kam’s ir­re­press­ible de­but novel, which won the fifth Epi­gram Books Fic­tion Prize ear­lier this year, af­ter the award was ex­panded from Sin­ga­pore to the rest of South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Kam, a his­tory scholar now do­ing his mas­ter’s de­gree in Michi­gan, in the United States, has pro­duced a breath­lessly ex­u­ber­ant romp through a myth­i­cal land­scape of “rebel Malaysias”.</p>
    <p>Gabriel, a young Ortho­dox Chris­tian can­tor, finds him­self on a mad­cap road trip in a bor­rowed car with a wise­crack­ing stranger called Khidir. This is al-Khidr, the Green Prophet, said to show up in times of cri­sis to bring about peace through mir­a­cles.</p>
    <p>Over in</p>
    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>coastal</p>
    <p>Pa­hang,</p>
    <p>US-ed­u­cated Ly­dia has re­turned for the fu­neral of her Loke Yee Por, the grand-aunt who raised her.</p>
    <p>Go­ing through the late woman’s ef­fects, she dis­cov­ers that not only did her grand-aunt fight with the com­mu­nists in the jun­gles dur­ing World War II, she was also in love with a woman called Ling Mo Niang.</p>
    <p>Both Gabriel and Ly­dia are un­wit­ting play­ers in Khidir’s gam­bit to raise the wali, the old saints of Malaysia, with whom he aims to do bat­tle with the Mouth, a monstrous de­mon of cap­i­tal­ism, and re­store power to the land it­self, “the fish and the trees and the sea”.</p>
    <p>This is a dizzy­ing tale of long-lost maybe-queens, mu­seum heists and high­ways of gold in the sky, blaz­ing through var­i­ous pan­theons of deities, spir­its and folk he­roes. Dos­to­evsky and Dover Beach are quoted in the same breath as Malay and Can­tonese with no foot­notes.</p>
    <p>Kam’s prose is blithe, sure-footed and brim­ming with an elan re­mark­able in a de­but writer.</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tive’s wild pace can lose steam some­times when its ideas sit down and talk the­o­log­i­cal shop, and read­ers’ en­joy­ment of the cli­max may hinge on their thresh­old for ser­mon­is­ing.</p>
    <p>But even a cynic would be hard­put to deny the hope that stirs in this crazy twist on ha­giog­ra­phy. This is a writer to watch.</p>
