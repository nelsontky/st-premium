    <p>Ex­perts in Sin­ga­pore say there is no ba­sis for Malaysia’s claim that it has found a strain of the coro­n­avirus that is 10 times more in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>They also say this strain – D614G – which is al­ready found in Sin­ga­pore, will have no im­pact on vac­cine devel­op­ment. The vari­ant has also been found in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral of Health, Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, had posted on his Face­book page on Sun­day that this mu­ta­tion, which he said had been “found by sci­en­tists in July 2020” and had now been iden­ti­fied in three pa­tients in Malaysia, is “10 times more in­fec­tious”.</p>
    <p>He added that vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped may be in­ef­fec­tive against this mu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>He at­trib­uted the spread of two re­cent clus­ters to this mu­ta­tion, which was first se­quenced in Malaysia last month.</p>
    <p>But Pro­fes­sor Wang Linfa, di­rec­tor of the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, told The Straits Times that there is “no real sci­en­tific data to make the claim that D614G is more trans­mis­si­ble, let alone the ten­fold claim”.</p>
    <p>His pro­gramme deputy, Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, said: “This mu­ta­tion would cer­tainly not im­pact vac­cine ef­fi­cacy since vac­cines would gen­er­ate an­ti­bod­ies that bind to many dif­fer­ent parts of the virus spike pro­tein and not just be lim­ited to the site of mu­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Liyang, an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist and epi­demi­ol­o­gist at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said this mu­ta­tion has been cir­cu­lat­ing here since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore se­quences a sam­pling of the virus from pa­tients, and has found more than 100 in­fec­tions with this mu­ta­tion be­tween Fe­bru­ary and last month.</p>
    <p>Since only a frac­tion of virus sam­ples are se­quenced, Prof Hsu said it would likely mean that thou­sands of in­fec­tions here are due to the D614G mu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>In June, an ar­ti­cle in the highly pres­ti­gious Cell jour­nal said the D614G vari­ant was rapidly be­com­ing dom­i­nant in the world. It said this mu­ta­tion is “un­likely to have a</p>
    <p>In June, an ar­ti­cle in the highly pres­ti­gious Cell jour­nal said the D614G vari­ant was rapidly be­com­ing dom­i­nant in the world. It said this mu­ta­tion is “un­likely to have a ma­jor im­pact on the ef­fi­cacy of vac­cines cur­rently in the pipe­line”. Pro­fes­sor Wang Linfa said this vari­ant is ge­net­i­cally more fit, but that does not mean it is more eas­ily spread.</p>
    <p>ma­jor im­pact on the ef­fi­cacy of vac­cines cur­rently in the pipe­line”.</p>
    <p>Prof Wang said this vari­ant is ge­net­i­cally more fit, but that does not mean it is more eas­ily spread.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pine Genome Cen­tre dis­closed that G614 was found in nine sam­ples ran­domly col­lected in Que­zon City.</p>
    <p>It is the same as D614G – which in­di­cates that D614 has be­come G614, due to a change in po­si­tion 614 of the virus genome from D (as­par­tic acid) to G (glycine).</p>
    <p>Philip­pines Health Un­der­sec­re­tary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the sam­ple size was still too small to con­clude that G614 had al­ready spread in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>She added that there is no de­fin­i­tive study show­ing that G614 was more trans­mis­si­ble than D614.</p>
    <p>Prof Hsu said: “It is un­sur­pris­ing to find the D614G in the Philip­pines, given how widely spread it is.”</p>
    <p>Dr Se­bas­tian Mau­rer-Stroh, deputy ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for re­search at the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s Bioin­for­mat­ics In­sti­tute, said mu­ta­tions are nat­u­ral steps in the evo­lu­tion of viruses.</p>
    <p>He said there are now three “G” clades or mu­ta­tions, in­clud­ing D614G, which have a “fit­ness ad­van­tage” that has seen them grow from 0 per cent of in­fec­tions in Jan­uary to 95 per cent last month.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “There is no need to panic.</p>
    <p>“Since this vari­ant has been cir­cu­lat­ing glob­ally, it can be ex­pected to be seen in any coun­try, and ev­ery coun­try with ac­tive sur­veil­lance has seen it al­ready, espe­cially re­lated to im­port from trav­ellers.”</p>
    <p>He ex­pects the virus to con­tinue mu­tat­ing and, in fact, there are al­ready six new group­ings.</p>
    <p>Dr Mau­rer-Stroh said: “So you can see that evo­lu­tion is al­ready be­yond just clade G (D614G) and we have seen ‘daugh­ters’ of the virus be­ing formed with clade GR com­mon in Europe and In­dia and clade GH more com­mon in the US.”</p>
    <p>He said mu­ta­tion “doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily mean in­creased vir­u­lence, but can have an op­po­site ef­fect – milder or asymp­to­matic in­fec­tion lead­ing to longer un­de­tected in­fec­tion”.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts are still de­bat­ing if D614G spreads more eas­ily.</p>
    <p>Dr Asok Ku­rup, who chairs the Academy of Medicine’s Chap­ter of In­fec­tious Dis­ease Physi­cians, said there has been no clin­i­cal im­pact from the mu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>But he added that should any mu­ta­tion prove more in­fec­tious, then cur­rent mea­sures such as mask­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing be­come even more im­por­tant.</p>
