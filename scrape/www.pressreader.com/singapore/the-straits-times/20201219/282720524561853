    <p>A Malaysian man was spared the gal­lows yes­ter­day af­ter he was ac­quit­ted by the Court of Ap­peal of drug traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>Pra­gas Kris­samy was among three men sen­tenced to death by the High Court last year for their in­volve­ment in a trans­ac­tion of 19.42g of di­amor­phine, also known as heroin, in 2017.</p>
    <p>He was 34 then, while the other two – Sin­ga­porean Im­ran Mohd Arip and Malaysian Tamil­sel­vam Ya­gasvranan – were 49 and 32 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the apex court also or­dered the drug traf­fick­ing charges against Im­ran and Tamil­sel­vam to be amended.</p>
    <p>On Feb 8, 2017, the trio met at the fourth-storey cor­ri­dor of Block 518 Jurong West Street. Pra­gas then took out a white plas­tic bag con­tain­ing the heroin from his back­pack and handed it to Im­ran, be­fore leav­ing with Tamil­sel­vam. The three men were ar­rested shortly af­ter.</p>
    <p>Pra­gas and Tamil­sel­vam were each charged with one count of traf­fick­ing the drugs to Im­ran, in fur­ther­ance of a com­mon in­ten­tion. Im­ran was charged with one count of en­gag­ing in a con­spir­acy with the other two men to traf­fick drugs.</p>
    <p>All three were even­tu­ally con­victed in the High Court of their re­spec­tive charges and sen­tenced to death, which they sub­se­quently ap­pealed against.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the court found that Pra­gas was “wil­fully blind” to the drugs, de­spite his claim that he had be­lieved he was car­ry­ing con­tra­band cig­a­rettes and did not know about the drugs.</p>
    <p>“Wil­ful blind­ness” is a legal term to describe a per­son de­lib­er­ately shut­ting his eyes to the truth, and im­plies that had he opened his eyes, he would have seen it.</p>
    <p>The High Court then ruled Pra­gas had “a clear, grounded and tar­geted sus­pi­cion” of what he was to de­liver</p>
    <p>– an el­e­ment of “wil­ful blind­ness” – based on three rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The first was that he was aware he was over­paid for as­sist­ing in de­liv­er­ing the con­tra­band cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond rea­son was that there was a dif­fer­ence be­tween the weight of the drugs in his back­pack and that of two car­tons of cig­a­rettes, which Pra­gas had claimed he was told to help de­liver.</p>
    <p>The last rea­son was that the sys­tem of de­liv­ery by him and Tamil­sel­vam on Feb 8, 2017, was “wholly out of keep­ing” with the de­liv­ery of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>But the Court of Ap­peal dis­agreed with the lower court’s rul­ing, find­ing that the pros­e­cu­tion had failed to prove be­yond a rea­son­able doubt that Pra­gas had such sus­pi­cion.</p>
    <p>The court held there was in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to show Pra­gas was aware he was be­ing over­paid for his role in the Feb 8 de­liv­ery. It also ac­cepted Pra­gas’ ex­pla­na­tion that he did not no­tice that the weight in his back­pack was dif­fer­ent from that of two car­tons of cig­a­rettes, not­ing that the dif­fer­ence in weight was “mar­ginal” – of about 380g.</p>
    <p>The apex court ad­di­tion­ally ruled, among other things, that there was no ev­i­dence on the usual mode of de­liv­ery of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes in Sin­ga­pore. “It can­not be de­nied that con­tra­band cig­a­rettes are also il­le­gal items and that their sale or de­liv­ery would also at­tract crim­i­nal pun­ish­ment un­der the Cus­toms Act,” the court said.</p>
    <p>“In that sense, we do not think the man­ner of the de­liv­ery on Feb 8, 2017, was such as to nec­es­sar­ily cause Pra­gas to sus­pect that it did not in­volve con­tra­band cig­a­rettes.”</p>
    <p>Separately in its judgment, the Court of Ap­peal re­jected sev­eral ar­gu­ments made by Tamil­sel­vam and Im­ran, in­clud­ing the lat­ter’s de­fence that he had in­tended to or­der only one pound in gross weight of heroin and not two pounds.</p>
    <p>The apex court also or­dered the charges against Tamil­sel­vam and Im­ran to be amended in the light of the court’s find­ings against the two men and Pra­gas’ ac­quit­tal, among other things.</p>
