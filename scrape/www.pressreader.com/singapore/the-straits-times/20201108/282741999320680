    <p>TOKYO At an up­scale ho­tel in Tokyo, gym­nasts from the United States, Rus­sia, China and Ja­pan are get­ting a taste of what more than 11,000 ath­letes might ex­pe­ri­ence when the city hosts the post­poned Olympic Games next year.</p>
    <p>They are pre­par­ing for to­day’s meet, which will be the first in­ter­na­tional event held at an Olympic venue since the Covid-19 pan­demic forced the Games’ post­pone­ment.</p>
    <p>The one-off event is seen as a trial run for how in­ter­na­tional ath­letes may travel to and stay in Ja­pan safely dur­ing the Games.</p>
    <p>The 30 gym­nasts are stay­ing at the same ho­tel but on sep­a­rate floors and have dif­fer­ent train­ing times to avoid con­tact.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore break­fast, we take a Covid test and they also gave us cell phones that alert us if some­one has Covid (in the group),” eM­jae Fra­zier, 16, who had pre­vi­ously never trav­elled out­side of the United States, told Reuters from her ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>“They are be­ing very safe and cau­tious but it is not like we are in prison.”</p>
    <p>Team mem­bers are chap­er­oned from the team bus to their rooms and to the din­ing room for meals.</p>
    <p>“The US team is only al­lowed to be in the el­e­va­tors (with the) US team,” said Yul Moldauer. “We can’t be in there with China, Rus­sia or Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“We are on the 14th floor and we aren’t al­lowed be­yond, only go­ing down for food when it is lunch, break­fast or din­ner time.”</p>
    <p>Moldauer, 23, who won the bronze at the 2017 World Cham­pi­onships, said he was not bored be­ing stuck in his room and was en­joy­ing look­ing at the view of Tokyo Tower from his win­dow.</p>
    <p>Gym­nasts all brought their own equip­ment, in­clud­ing chalk, which was shared formerly.</p>
    <p>As well as daily Covid-19 tests, com­peti­tors and team of­fi­cials must pass through tem­per­a­ture checks and anti-bac­te­rial sprays when ar­riv­ing at the meet venue.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, any­body en­ter­ing – in­clud­ing up to 2,000 spec­ta­tors</p>
    <p>– is sprayed with a dis­in­fec­tant mist.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s three-time Olympic gold medal­list Ko­hei Uchimura said yes­ter­day the meet could well be a “model” for the Games next year if all goes well.</p>
    <p>“For the sake of the Olympics, I think this com­pe­ti­tion must be suc­cess­ful no mat­ter what,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think we can make it be­come a model for good Olympics by re­port­ing nei­ther in­fected pa­tients nor in­juries.”</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 last week, but sev­eral sub­se­quent fol­low-up tests were neg­a­tive and he has been cleared to take part in to­day’s event.</p>
