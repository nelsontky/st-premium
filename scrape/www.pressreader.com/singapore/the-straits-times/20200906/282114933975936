    <p>Field goal from the Mil­wau­kee Bucks in the fi­nal 4min 20sec of the game, dur­ing which they took 10 shots, in­clud­ing seven from three-point range.</p>
    <p>OR­LANDO • Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo in­sisted that he could have played more on Fri­day, af­ter the Mil­wau­kee Bucks fell into a 3-0 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) East­ern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals se­ries hole.</p>
    <p>In what was a must-win game against the Mi­ami Heat in Dis­ney World, the league’s reign­ing Most Valu­able Player was lim­ited to un­der 35 min­utes. The Bucks started the fourth quar­ter with­out their su­per­star on the floor and ended it with a his­toric col­lapse as the Heat won 115-100.</p>
    <p>The Bucks went into the fourth quar­ter 12 points up, but were outscored 40-13 – the most lop­sided fi­nal pe­riod in a play-off game since the NBA in­tro­duced the shot clock in 1954.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who tweaked his an­kle in the first quar­ter and left the arena with a no­tice­able limp, scored just four points in the fourth quar­ter. Heat star Jimmy Butler scored 17 of his game-high 30 points that pe­riod – more than the en­tire Bucks ros­ter.</p>
    <p>“I feel great,” An­te­tok­oun­mpo said af­ter fin­ish­ing with 21 points, 16 re­bounds, nine as­sists and two blocks. “I could play more.”</p>
    <p>But two-time NBA Coach of the Year Mike Bu­den­holzer de­fended his us­age of the for­ward and Khris Mid­dle­ton, who had 18 points and seven as­sists in 36:02.</p>
    <p>“No, I think we, ob­vi­ously, it’s 48 min­utes. You gotta be good for the last 12. If any­thing, I think keep­ing us fresh and ready to go and com­pete and all those things,” Bu­den­holzer said. “Khris was in a lit­tle bit of a foul trou­ble. It’s a high level. If you’re go­ing as hard as these guys are in a play-off game, 35-36, I think that’s push­ing the ceil­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Bucks might not have many min­utes left to save their sea­son. No NBA team in 139 pre­vi­ous sce­nar­ios has come back from a 3-0 se­ries deficit.</p>
    <p>“We’re not com­fort­able, we’re not com­pla­cent,” said Butler said ahead of Game 4 today. “We know we’re gonna have to earn this last one as well.”</p>
    <p>Mi­ami, 7-0 in these play-offs, also got 20 points and a team-high 16 re­bounds from Bam Ade­bayo. Jae Crow­der made a big con­tri­bu­tion with 17 points, sink­ing five of 11 three-point at­tempts.</p>
    <p>Mil­wau­kee got a team-high 22 points from Brook Lopez.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo shot just sev­en­for-21 from the floor, in­clud­ing zero-for-seven from three-point range.</p>
    <p>The Heat had a 54-33 ad­van­tage on threes in Game 3 and have outscored the Bucks 141-102 on tre­bles in the se­ries.</p>
    <p>The Bucks were with­out a field goal in the last 4min 20sec, when the over­all top seeds were ze­roof-10 from the floor, with seven of those misses from be­hind the arc.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, if there is a team that can beat a team 4-0, and beat them, it can be us,” An­te­tok­oun­mpo said.</p>
    <p>“We just got to be­lieve in our­selves, watch the tape, play hard. We can’t do it game by game but play by play, po­si­tion by po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Western Con­fer­ence top seeds the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers and star LeBron James were also beaten on Fri­day, fall­ing 112-97 to the Hous­ton Rock­ets in Game 1 of their Western Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal se­ries.</p>
    <p>James Harden’s 36 points fu­elled the Rock­ets, whose size dis­ad­van­tage against the Lak­ers proved no hand­i­cap.</p>
    <p>“Our de­fence, that’s go­ing to get us to where we want to go,” he said. “This (Lak­ers) team is the best team in the West, if we can hold them un­der 100 points, de­fen­sively we’ve got some­thing.”</p>
    <p>An­thony Davis led the Lak­ers with 25 points and 14 re­bounds.</p>
