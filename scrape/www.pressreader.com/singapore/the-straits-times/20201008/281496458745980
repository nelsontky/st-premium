    <p>South Korea was the top choice in a poll ask­ing which coun­try Sin­ga­pore should ne­go­ti­ate with for an air travel bub­ble agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The coun­try was the clear favourite with 40.7 per cent of the vote, fol­lowed by Ja­pan with 17.7 per cent and Thai­land with 16.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Malaysia (11.6 per cent), New Zealand (8.6 per cent) and China (4.5 per cent) rounded out the list.</p>
    <p>The on­line poll was con­ducted by The Straits Times on Face­book yes­ter­day af­ter Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung’s state­ment in Par­lia­ment on Tues­day that Sin­ga­pore will ne­go­ti­ate air travel bub­bles with safe coun­tries or re­gions in an ar­range­ment for gen­eral trav­ellers with­out the con­trolled itin­er­ary re­quired by cur­rent travel agree­ments.</p>
    <p>The poll re­ceived more than 6,000 re­sponses. Read­ers were asked to choose from six coun­tries that Sin­ga­pore al­ready has some form of travel ar­range­ments with, or is in the process of dis­cussing such ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and South Korea have had a safe travel fast-lane agree­ment since Sept 2 which is re­served for es­sen­tial business and of­fi­cial travel. Trav­ellers us­ing the fast lane must have a SafeTravel Pass and go only through Seoul’s In­cheon In­ter­na­tional Air­port.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic has had a sim­i­lar ar­range­ment with Ja­pan since Sept 11, known as the re­cip­ro­cal green lane. Sin­ga­pore has also been in talks with Thai­land since Aug 26 about a sim­i­lar lane.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­est in South Korea, Ja­pan and Thai­land was not sur­pris­ing for travel agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Ms Ali­cia Seah, di­rec­tor of pub­lic re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Dy­nasty Travel, said there is strong in­ter­est in des­ti­na­tions such as New Zealand and South Korea. “South Korea has a lot of pull fac­tors, from its fash­ion and cul­ture, to food and cos­met­ics. Des­ti­na­tions like Ja­pan and Thai­land are nearby with less than seven hours of flight time.”</p>
    <p>But she stressed that many bal­ance trav­el­ling with keep­ing safe, adding: “Many Sin­ga­pore­ans are keen to get away but are still cau­tious of the po­ten­tial risk.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jeremiah Wong, senior mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager at Chan Broth­ers Travel, said: “South Korea and Ja­pan are two of our top-per­form­ing des­ti­na­tions over the years due to Sin­ga­pore­ans’ pen­chant for the many unique touris­tic ex­pe­ri­ences they can en­joy... such as food, shop­ping, the arts and pop­u­lar cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>For con­sumers, safety is still key. Data scientist Lim Wen Qing, 24, said: “To be hon­est, I just want to go some­where. I would like to go to South Korea for the food and the sights, but any place with low lev­els of Covid-19 is at­trac­tive right now.”</p>

Travel agents say the in&#xAD;ter&#xAD;est in South Korea was not sur&#xAD;pris&#xAD;ing, with one adding that the coun&#xAD;try has many pull fac&#xAD;tors, from fash&#xAD;ion and cul&#xAD;ture, to food and cos&#xAD;met&#xAD;ics.</p>
