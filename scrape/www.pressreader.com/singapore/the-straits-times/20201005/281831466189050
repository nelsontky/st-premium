    <p>Cam­bo­dia has razed a United States-funded de­fence fa­cil­ity on its south­ern coast, the deputy prime min­is­ter con­firmed yes­ter­day, the lat­est move in the on­go­ing con­tro­ver­sial ex­pan­sion of a strate­gi­cally cru­cial naval base be­ing de­vel­oped with Chi­nese aid.</p>
    <p>The Wall Street Jour­nal re­ported last year on a se­cret draft deal al­low­ing China to dock war­ships at the Ream naval base near the king­dom’s coastal city of Si­hanoukvill­e. But Cam­bo­dia – awash in re­cent years with Chi­nese in­vest­ments – has stren­u­ously de­nied the report, al­though Premier Hun Sen has said that aid from Bei­jing will fund the naval base’s de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Satel­lite images re­leased by the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies last week showed a US-funded fa­cil­ity on Ream’s naval base had been de­mol­ished, rais­ing ques­tions “about ru­moured Chi­nese ac­cess”, said the Wash­ing­ton­based think-tank.</p>
    <p>But Mr Tea Banh, Cam­bo­dia’s Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and De­fence Min­is­ter, dis­missed the con­cerns yes­ter­day. “We re­lo­cated the fa­cil­ity to a new spot. We can­not keep it any more and the build­ing is al­ready old,” he told the Agence France-Presse, con­firm­ing that it was knocked down last month.</p>
    <p>The Tac­ti­cal Head­quar­ters of the Na­tional Com­mit­tee for Mar­itime Se­cu­rity was in­au­gu­rated in 2012. It will be far bet­ter in its new lo­ca­tion, Mr Tea Banh said, adding Cam­bo­dia used “only a small as­sis­tance” from the US for the now-de­mol­ished build­ing.</p>
    <p>The new fa­cil­ity is un­der con­struc­tion about 30km north of Ream. The Ream base has gen­er­ated scru­tiny for its strate­gic lo­ca­tion in the Gulf of Thai­land, which would pro­vide ready ac­cess to the fiercely con­tested South China Sea – a key global ship­ping route.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing claims the ma­jor­ity of the re­source-rich sea, vy­ing with six other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Hun Sen has re­peat­edly in­sisted that Cam­bo­dia’s Con­sti­tu­tion for­bids any for­eign mil­i­tary base within its bor­ders. An­a­lysts say the premier is deeply at­tuned to the po­ten­tial for an anti-China back­lash from the pub­lic – es­pe­cially in Si­hanoukvill­e, where busi­nesses and casi­nos are largely Chi­nese-owned.</p>
    <p>Mr Hun Sen has in re­cent years tilted away from the US due to Washington’s crit­i­cism of his gov­ern­ment’s al­leged abuses. On Satur­day night, he is­sued a pub­lic let­ter wish­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump a “speedy re­cov­ery” from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>OLD FA­CIL­ITY NOT THERE ANY MORE</p>
    <p>We re­lo­cated the fa­cil­ity to a new spot. We can­not keep it any more and the build­ing is al­ready old.</p>
