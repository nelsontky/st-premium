    <p>Their names are of­ten in­nocu­ous, like Mush­room, Pink or Spice, but they can be deadly.</p>
    <p>New psy­choac­tive sub­stances, or NPS, are some­times dis­guised as anti-anx­i­ety med­i­ca­tion such as Xanax and di­azepam.</p>
    <p>These new-gen­er­a­tion drugs are among some of the most com­mon ones found in raids is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>But they are dif­fi­cult to iden­tify as syn­di­cates con­stantly tweak their chem­i­cal struc­tures to avoid de­tec­tion by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It typ­i­cally takes at least two weeks to iden­tify NPS, com­pared with three to four days for known drugs.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the team of ex­perts who an­a­lyse these drugs work in the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity’s (HSA) Il­licit Drugs Lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times vis­ited the lab in Ou­tram for an in­side look at where the new sub­stances and other tra­di­tional drugs such as heroin, cannabis and Ec­stasy are an­a­lysed to help the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) and other au­thor­i­ties in le­gal pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>“The NPS mar­ket is highly dy­namic, with new NPS ap­pear­ing as fast as those that have dis­ap­peared from the mar­ket,” said the lab’s se­nior foren­sic sci­en­tist Ong Mei Ching.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers and types of NPS are con­stantly evolv­ing across the globe and in Sin­ga­pore. The an­a­lyt­i­cal method used would hence need to be con­stantly re­viewed and en­hanced in or­der to keep up with the evolv­ing trend, which is in­deed chal­leng­ing.”</p>
    <p>The lab pro­vides CNB with re­ports on the new drugs, so leg­isla­tive mea­sures can keep pace with the NPS mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“This has con­trib­uted to timely con­trol of new NPS en­coun­tered in Sin­ga­pore, and greatly re­duced the win­dow that drug traf­fick­ers can use to trade the new drugs,” said Dr Ong.</p>
    <p>As at Sept 4, un­der the Mis­use of Drugs Act, there were 12 generic groups and 67 in­di­vid­u­ally named NPS listed as Class A con­trolled drugs. It is an of­fence to traf­fic, man­u­fac­ture, im­port, ex­port, pos­sess or con­sume such drugs.</p>
    <p>The drugs de­fined in the generic classes have the same core chem­i­cal struc­ture. This group­ing al­lows for a range of drugs with sub­sti­tu­tions to their chem­i­cal struc­ture to be con­trolled.</p>
    <p>Those found guilty of pos­sess­ing or con­sum­ing NPS face up to 10 years’ jail, a fine of $20,000, or both. Those con­victed of traf­fick­ing, man­u­fac­tur­ing, im­port­ing or ex­port­ing NPS face a min­i­mum of five years’ jail and five strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>While the tox­i­c­i­ties and phar­ma­co­log­i­cal ef­fects of NPS are not fully known, they have psy­choac­tive ef­fects that are meant to mimic that of tra­di­tional drugs.</p>
    <p>Since their chem­i­cal struc­tures are con­stantly mod­i­fied, abusers of­ten do not know what they are con­sum­ing. There have been four NPS-re­lated deaths since 2016.</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently no ev­i­dence that these drugs are pro­duced lo­cally. But they are the se­cond-most abused among new of­fend­ers in Sin­ga­pore and the third-most over­all, with 414 drug abusers – or 11.7 per cent of the to­tal – ar­rested for tak­ing NPS last year.</p>
    <p>NPS first emerged in Europe in 2004 and spread rapidly around the world. From 126 vari­ants of NPS de­tected glob­ally in 2009, the fig­ure had risen to 892 last year.</p>
    <p>The World Drug Re­port 2020 noted that most of the syn­thetic NPS iden­ti­fied glob­ally in the last decade are stim­u­lants, fol­lowed by syn­thetic cannabi­noids and hal­lu­cino­gens.</p>
    <p>To deal with the ris­ing threat of NPS, it was an­nounced dur­ing the de­bate on the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs’ bud­get in March that Sin­ga­pore would re­view its laws.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has been proac­tively list­ing NPS since 2010.</p>
    <p>CNB and HSA said last month that they han­dle the NPS threat by strength­en­ing leg­is­la­tion, en­hanc­ing de­tec­tion and en­force­ment mea­sures, and re­new­ing ef­forts to ed­u­cate young peo­ple about the harm­ful ef­fects of drugs and NPS.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, CNB reg­u­larly lists NPS that have emerged in the global mar­ket that have no le­gal uses, and a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of the NPS re­ported overseas are al­ready cur­rently con­trolled un­der the Mis­use of Drugs Act.</p>
    <p>For the sci­en­tists in the Il­licit Drugs Lab­o­ra­tory, stay­ing ahead of drug trends re­mains cru­cial to help­ing the au­thor­i­ties have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the NPS threat in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The ad­vent of NPS since a decade ago has brought about a par­a­digm shift in drug iden­ti­fi­ca­tion for foren­sic labs,” said Dr Ong.</p>
    <p>Gas chro­matog­ra­phy mass spec­trom­e­try, a method of chem­i­cal anal­y­sis to iden­tify tra­di­tional drugs, may be in­suf­fi­cient to tackle NPS, she added. “In or­der to cope with these chal­lenges, we must be ag­ile and adapt­able.”</p>
