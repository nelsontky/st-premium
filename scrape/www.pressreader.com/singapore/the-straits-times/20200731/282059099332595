    <p>I read with trep­i­da­tion that cases of Covid-19 are re-emerg­ing in coun­tries that pre­vi­ously had stel­lar records of con­trol­ling this pan­demic, for ex­am­ple, Viet­nam and Aus­tralia (Bor­der clo­sures to halt virus not sus­tain­able, says WHO, July 28).</p>
    <p>It is clear that in this fight against</p>
    <p>Covid-19, there is no bat­tle line be­hind which we can relax and hide in safety.</p>
    <p>In­stead, this in­vis­i­ble en­emy lurks in ev­ery cor­ner of our lives, wait­ing pa­tiently and op­por­tunis­ti­cally to con­quer and re­gain a foothold.</p>
    <p>It takes only a care­less spark to reignite the flames of con­ta­gion, and this stealthy virus will glee­fully make our lives mis­er­able again.</p>
    <p>I hope and pray that here in Sin­ga­pore, our re­cent low daily num­bers of cases in the com­mu­nity will not lull us into com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>With such low num­bers, some peo­ple may think they can­not be so un­lucky as to be the ones in­fected. But, in fact, luck has noth­ing to do with it. We must re­mind our­selves that the out­come of this bat­tle is all within our con­trol, if we col­lec­tively arm our­selves with the sim­ple bat­tle strate­gies of hand hy­giene, safe dis­tanc­ing and mask­ing, all car­ried out with the ut­most care and dis­ci­pline. We must each aim to not be the weak­est link.</p>
    <p>Even as the shadow of fa­tigue in­evitably sets in, each and ev­ery one of us must wake up daily with re­newed re­solve to out­last this marathon duel with Covid-19.</p>
