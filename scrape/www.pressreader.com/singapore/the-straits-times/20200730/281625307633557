    <p>The Sin­ga­pore econ­omy saw a net loss of 121,800 work­ers be­tween April and June this year, the high­est quar­terly fall on record. How­ever, although re­trench­ments and res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment shot up, the num­bers that ap­pear to be af­fected are sig­nif­i­cantly lower.</p>
    <p>A total of 6,700 work­ers were re­trenched last quar­ter, more than dou­ble the num­ber laid off in the first quar­ter, while the num­ber of un­em­ployed res­i­dents climbed to 90,500 in June, 14,300 more than in March.</p>
    <p>The data – pre­lim­i­nary es­ti­mates re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power yes­ter­day – sug­gests that the bulk of the work­ers who left em­ploy­ment were for­eign­ers, although no of­fi­cial breakdown is avail­able yet. Be­cause they can­not stay on in­def­i­nitely af­ter los­ing or leav­ing their job, they drop out of the un­em­ploy­ment statis­tics. That is why the over­all un­em­ploy­ment rate is lower than the rates for res­i­dents and cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Some res­i­dents may also have left the labour force af­ter be­ing re­trenched be­cause they do not ex­pect to find a job any time soon. They do not show up in un­em­ploy­ment data ei­ther as they are not ac­tively look­ing for a job.</p>
    <p>Also, since the min­istry’s re­trench­ment data is only for the pub­lic sec­tor and pri­vate es­tab­lish­ments with at least 25 em­ploy­ees, res­i­dents laid off by smaller firms, such as some re­tail­ers, eater­ies and mom-and­pop shops, would not be in­cluded.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers ex­pect the labour mar­ket con­di­tion to de­te­ri­o­rate fur­ther in the se­cond half of the year, and ex­tend­ing sup­port mea­sures could help cush­ion fur­ther im­pact on lo­cals. The fi­nal pay­outs for the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which sub­sidises the wages of lo­cal work­ers, and the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme are in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye es­ti­mated that about $20 bil­lion will prob­a­bly be used for the Jobs</p>
    <p>Sup­port Scheme, less than the al­lo­cated $23.5 bil­lion. The re­main­ing $3.5 bil­lion pro­vides fis­cal room for a scaled-down wage sub­sidy scheme for the worst-hit sec­tors, pos­si­bly cov­er­ing the re­main­ing months un­til the next Bud­get, they said.</p>
    <p>De­spite all that is be­ing done, more re­trench­ments seem in­evitable. For ex­am­ple, many ho­tels and tourist at­trac­tions will not see vis­i­tors reach their pre-pan­demic lev­els for maybe a year or more, and it would be very dif­fi­cult for them to keep work­ers em­ployed over such a long pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But the process has to be done prop­erly and fairly. The Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Man­ag­ing Ex­cess Man­power and Re­spon­si­ble Re­trench­ment says em­ploy­ers should not tar­get older and preg­nant em­ploy­ees un­fairly, and should communicat­e with em­ploy­ees early and ex­plain to them why a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise is needed, how it will be car­ried out, what fac­tors will be con­sid­ered, and what as­sis­tance they will get to find an­other job.</p>
    <p>Con­duct­ing a re­trench­ment fairly and with com­pas­sion makes busi­ness sense for a com­pany that is go­ing to need work­ers again in the fu­ture when things im­prove.</p>
    <p>You would not want to jeop­ar­dise your com­pany’s rep­u­ta­tion be­cause of how you treat work­ers when times are bad.</p>
    <p>It is also the right thing to do. Be­sides pre­serv­ing ex­ist­ing jobs, the Gov­ern­ment has also launched a ma­jor ef­fort to create 100,000 op­por­tu­ni­ties for job seek­ers in the next year through the SG United Jobs and Skills pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>These in­clude at­tach­ments or trainee­ships, and train­ing places. The lat­est ini­tia­tive makes 13,000 com­pany at­tach­ments avail­able for mid-ca­reer job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is sub­si­dis­ing train­ing al­lowances. De­pend­ing on the scheme, the al­lowance can be from about $1,100 to $3,000.</p>
    <p>There has been some con­cern about whether the op­por­tu­ni­ties be­ing cre­ated are good enough. The harsh re­al­ity is that there will not be enough per­ma­nent jobs for ev­ery­body who needs one, and there are some peo­ple and fam­i­lies who will see big drops in in­come.</p>
    <p>But through the train­ing places and at­tach­ments, the Gov­ern­ment is pro­vid­ing some ba­sic in­come for job seek­ers even if it is lower than what they were earn­ing.</p>
    <p>At­tach­ments could turn into per­ma­nent jobs. OCBC Bank chief econ­o­mist Se­lena Ling, for ex­am­ple, said her team took on a trainee un­der a sim­i­lar scheme dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. They then of­fered the per­son a con­tract a year later, and even­tu­ally, a per­ma­nent job.</p>
    <p>And for peo­ple who are mak­ing ca­reer switches and en­ter­ing new growth in­dus­tries, there is the hope that prospects will im­prove.</p>
