    <p>The head of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has said that he was very dis­ap­pointed that China has still not au­tho­rised the en­try of a team of in­ter­na­tional ex­perts to ex­am­ine the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The 10-strong team had been due to set off early this month as part of a long-awaited mis­sion to probe early cases of the coro­n­avirus, first re­ported more than a year ago in China’s Wuhan.</p>
    <p>“To­day, we learnt that Chi­nese of­fi­cials have not yet fi­nalised the nec­es­sary per­mis­sions for the team’s ar­rival in China,” WHO direc­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus told an on­line news con­fer­ence in Geneva on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“I have been in con­tact with se­nior Chi­nese of­fi­cials and I have once again made it clear the mis­sion is a pri­or­ity for the WHO,” he said of the trip, which he added was de­vel­oped with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The mis­sion was due to be led by Dr Peter Ben Em­barek, WHO’s top expert on an­i­mal dis­eases that cross the species bar­rier, who went to China on a pre­lim­i­nary mis­sion in July last year.</p>
    <p>Two mem­bers of the in­ter­na­tional team had al­ready set out on their jour­ney to China. One has now turned back and the other is in tran­sit in a third coun­try, said emer­gen­cies chief Mike Ryan.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added: “We trust and hope that is just a lo­gis­tic and bu­reau­cratic is­sue that can be re­solved very quickly.”</p>
    <p>Ahead of the trip, Bei­jing has been seek­ing to shape the nar­ra­tive about when and where the pan­demic be­gan, with se­nior diplo­mat Wang Yi say­ing that “more and more stud­ies” showed it emerged in mul­ti­ple re­gions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan has pre­vi­ously called this highly spec­u­la­tive.</p>
    <p>China has dis­missed crit­i­cism of its han­dling of early cases that emerged in late 2019, al­though some, in­clud­ing United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, have ques­tioned Bei­jing’s ac­tions dur­ing the out­break.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has called for a trans­par­ent in­ves­ti­ga­tion, and crit­i­cised the terms un­der which Chi­nese ex­perts con­ducted the first phase of re­search.</p>
