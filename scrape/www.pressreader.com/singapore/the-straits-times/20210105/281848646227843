    <p>•</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple lined up in Beijing yes­ter­day to re­ceive a Covid-19 vac­cine as China races to in­oc­u­late mil­lions be­fore the Chi­nese New Year mass travel sea­son next month.</p>
    <p>More than 73,000 peo­ple in the Chi­nese cap­i­tal have re­ceived the first dose of the vac­cine over the past cou­ple of days, state me­dia re­ported on Sun­day, in­clud­ing com­mu­nity work­ers and bus driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Health au­thor­i­ties on Dec 31 granted con­di­tional ap­proval to a vac­cine can­di­date made by Chi­nese pharma gi­ant Sinopharm, which the com­pany said had a 79 per cent ef­fi­cacy rate.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple were bussed into a tem­po­rary vac­cine cen­tre at a cen­tral park, af­ter be­ing in­structed to fill in elec­tronic forms about their health sta­tus and any al­ler­gies at an out­side gate. Some were wear­ing two lay­ers of sur­gi­cal face masks.</p>
    <p>One man sur­named Gu, a cater­ing worker in his 30s, said his em­ployer had booked an ap­point­ment at the cen­tre for him, and that he wanted the jab “for peace of mind”.</p>
    <p>Footage from state broad­caster CCTV showed queues out­side lo­cal hos­pi­tals and com­mu­nity health cen­tres as peo­ple waited to read con­sent forms and have their tem­per­a­tures taken be­fore get­ting the jab. Gyms and empty fac­to­ries were among the sites be­ing used.</p>
    <p>China plans to in­oc­u­late mil­lions this win­ter in the run-up to Chi­nese New Year. Beijing has al­ready ad­min­is­tered around 4.5 mil­lion doses of emer­gency vac­cines – mostly to health work­ers and other state em­ploy­ees des­tined for over­seas jobs.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine will also be grad­u­ally rolled out to key groups con­sid­ered to have a high risk of ex­po­sure to the virus, in­clud­ing port and food lo­gis­tic work­ers and peo­ple plan­ning to re­turn to stud­ies abroad.</p>
    <p>China, where the coro­n­avirus first emerged late in 2019 – has broadly stamped out the virus in­side its borders, im­pos­ing swift lo­cal lock­downs and mass test­ing when cases emerge. The coun­try has stepped up test­ing and movement con­trols af­ter a re­cent spate of small lo­cal out­breaks, in­clud­ing a hand­ful of cases in Beijing.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi said out­breaks out­side of the coun­try may have caused the Covid-19 pan­demic, as Beijing steps up ef­forts to re­cast the nar­ra­tive amid grow­ing scru­tiny over the virus’ ori­gins.</p>
    <p>“More and more re­search sug­gests that the pan­demic was likely to have been caused by sep­a­rate out­breaks in mul­ti­ple places in the world,” Mr Wang said in com­ments pub­lished over the week­end from an in­ter­view with the of­fi­cial Xinhua News Agency and CCTV.</p>
    <p>China took “im­me­di­ate ac­tions to carry out epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tion, iden­tify the pathogen and pub­li­cise key in­for­ma­tion in­clud­ing the genome se­quenc­ing of the virus”, he said. “All this sounded alarm bells across the world.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wang’s com­ments come a year af­ter the first known clus­ter of cases emerged in the cen­tral Chi­nese city of Wuhan, be­fore spread­ing around the globe. China was crit­i­cised for ini­tially cov­er­ing up hu­man-to-hu­man trans­mis­sion and for act­ing too slowly to halt its spread. Doc­tors who blew the whis­tle on a mys­te­ri­ous new pneu­mo­nia were ac­cused by po­lice of spread­ing ru­mours.</p>
    <p>With its do­mes­tic out­break largely con­tained, Beijing is stonewalli­ng ef­forts to find out more about the virus’ ori­gins, with World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion ex­perts kept out of Wuhan last year and an in­de­pen­dent probe re­buffed.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view, Mr Wang said: “We have stood at the fore­front of fight­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion, re­but­ting at­tempts of politi­ci­sa­tion and stig­ma­ti­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We were de­ter­mined to make sure that the ob­jec­tive nar­ra­tive and col­lec­tive mem­ory of the bat­tle against the pan­demic would not be dis­torted by lies.”</p>
