    <p>SOFIA (Bul­garia) Ac­tion movie star Jean-Claude Van Damme has come to the res­cue of a three­month-old chi­huahua, sav­ing her from eu­thana­sia on Mon­day af­ter a le­gal tus­sle be­tween Nor­way and Bul­garia.</p>
    <p>The dog named Raya was sold to new own­ers in Nor­way last month, but of­fi­cials there would not reg­is­ter her be­cause she had trav­elled on a fake Bul­gar­ian pass­port.</p>
    <p>Nor­way tried to repa­tri­ate the an­i­mal, but Bul­garia re­fused to take her back be­cause of Euro­pean Union rules about the trans­port of live an­i­mals, leav­ing the dog fac­ing eu­thana­sia – un­til the Bel­gian film leg­end got in­volved.</p>
    <p>Van Damme, known for movies such as Dou­ble Im­pact (1991), Hard Tar­get (1993) and Sud­den Death (1995), launched an emo­tive cam­paign on so­cial me­dia over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor, who turns 60 on Sun­day, posted self­ies of him hug­ging his chi­huahua, which even­tu­ally per­suaded the Bul­gar­ian Food Safety Au­thor­ity to ac­cept the dog back.</p>
    <p>“I beg, please, for my birth­day, the Food Safety Au­thor­ity, change your de­ci­sion,” Van Damme wrote, launch­ing a pe­ti­tion to save the dog.</p>
    <p>“They made a mis­take, the peo­ple who didn’t do the pa­per cor­rectly... But they can­not kill that lit­tle chi­huahua.”</p>
    <p>The food safety au­thor­ity says Raya will have med­i­cal checks when she gets back to Bul­garia and will be put up for adop­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ya­vor Gechev from the Four Paws an­i­mal rights or­gan­i­sa­tion said on Mon­day that Bul­garia should be con­grat­u­lated for show­ing flex­i­bil­ity, but called for stricter con­trol on il­le­gal breed­ers and an­i­mal traf­fick­ers.</p>
    <p>“The ex­port of pets from east­ern to west­ern and north­ern Europe is a lu­cra­tive busi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>The dog’s fake pass­port meant she would have been put down yes­ter­day un­der Nor­way’s leg­is­la­tion, said Mr Gechev.</p>
    <p>The mis­ad­ven­tures of Raya re­sem­ble the story of Penka the cow, which also faced death af­ter wan­der­ing over Bul­garia’s bor­der with Ser­bia in May 2018.</p>
    <p>Penka was saved thanks to an in­ter­na­tional cam­paign i n her de­fence joined by for­mer Bea­tle Paul McCart­ney.</p>
