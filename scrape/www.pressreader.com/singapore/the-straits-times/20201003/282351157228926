    <p>Europe’s ma­jor economies are ex­pected to re­main in de­fla­tion over the com­ing months, Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank (ECB) pres­i­dent Chris­tine La­garde has warned.</p>
    <p>Not­with­stand­ing the ECB’s stim­u­lus pro­gramme, which of­fers cheap loans to banks to stim­u­late de­mand, con­sumer prices are fall­ing as house­holds re­spond to the eco­nomic un­cer­tainty by hold­ing back on spend­ing, thereby putting jobs at risk.</p>
    <p>Ms La­garde also warned in an ap­pear­ance be­fore the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment ear­lier this week that out­put in Europe was not ex­pected to re­cover to pre-cri­sis lev­els for the next two years, and that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic “will con­tinue to weigh on eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and poses down­side risks to the eco­nomic out­look”.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ments in key Euro­pean coun­tries seem to con­firm the cen­tral banker’s pes­simistic view.</p>
    <p>Italy has just re­leased fore­casts in­di­cat­ing it ex­pects its econ­omy to con­tract by 9 per cent this year, a down­ward re­vi­sion on the ear­lier</p>
    <p>pro­jec­tions that es­ti­mated a de­cline of only 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Italy’s wors­en­ing prospects are sig­nif­i­cant for the Euro­pean Union, since the coun­try’s pub­lic debt, the high­est pro­por­tion­ally in the euro zone af­ter Greece’s, looms large over the sta­bil­ity of the euro.</p>
    <p>Italy is com­mit­ted to re­duc­ing its debt-to-GDP bur­den, and the coun­try’s Trea­sury re­it­er­ated this week a prom­ise that this will be done. But no fig­ures were at­tached to this prom­ise, and cur­rent trends go in the op­po­site di­rec­tion. While Italy’s to­tal pub­lic debt was forecast to top around 157 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) this year,</p>
    <p>it now looks likely to grow to around 159 per cent.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy Min­is­ter Roberto Gualtieri is re­ly­ing very much on the EU’s newly adopted</p>
    <p>€750 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) “re­cov­ery fund” of grants and loans de­signed to deal with the eco­nomic con­se­quences of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But this fund is not de­signed to deal with im­me­di­ate liq­uid­ity prob­lems of EU states and may not be avail­able un­til the mid­dle of next year, so it’s not much of a con­so­la­tion for a coun­try like Italy, which will strug­gle to meet re­demp­tion re­quire­ments of about €120 bil­lion worth of old debt by the</p>
    <p>year end, even be­fore tak­ing into ac­count the shock of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Much of Italy’s cred­i­bil­ity will de­pend on Mr Gualtieri’s claim that the econ­omy will ex­pe­ri­ence a V-shaped re­cov­ery, a sharp bounce-back af­ter the cur­rent deep fall. The gov­ern­ment’s eco­nomic plan as­sumes growth will re­bound to a pos­i­tive 6 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>But for a coun­try that has reg­is­tered anaemic eco­nomic growth for decades, such pro­jected fig­ures are op­ti­mistic, even though much of the pro­jected re­bound would merely be a re­cov­ery of lost eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties this year.</p>
    <p>France, mean­while, adopted a bud­get this week that aims to pro­vide the econ­omy with a fur­ther fi­nan­cial boost. Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron re­cently un­veiled a €100 bil­lion re­cov­ery plan and the gov­ern­ment is al­ready plan­ning to use the cash. “By the end of 2021, we want to re­lease</p>
    <p>€42 bil­lion of these funds, so nearly half of it, in or­der to have quick eco­nomic re­sults,” said Fi­nance Min­is­ter Bruno Le Maire.</p>
    <p>Like his Ital­ian coun­ter­part,</p>
    <p>Mr Le Maire is plan­ning on 8 per cent eco­nomic growth next year, af­ter the French econ­omy shrank by 10 per cent this year on an an­nu­alised ba­sis. But the French gov­ern­ment is as opaque as the Ital­ian one about pub­lish­ing the ba­sis of these cal­cu­la­tions. And the re­cov­ery funds pro­moted by Mr Macron in­tend to achieve much more than just pro­tect jobs; there are grand plans to bring back the man­u­fac­tur­ing of med­i­cal sup­plies to French-based com­pa­nies and pro­mote green en­ergy tech­nolo­gies, the sort of spend­ing that is un­likely to trans­late into the speedy eco­nomic re­cov­ery now touted by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The only op­ti­mistic mes­sage comes – as it of­ten does on eco­nomic mat­ters – from Ger­many, where Econ­omy Min­is­ter Peter Alt­maier said he ex­pects the na­tion’s GDP to con­tract by only 5.8 per cent this year, a far less se­vere out­come than orig­i­nally feared.</p>
    <p>One rea­son for Ger­many’s rel­a­tively favourable eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion is the fact that the coun­try was less af­fected by the pan­demic and that, con­se­quently, its lock­down was not as strict as else­where in Europe.</p>
    <p>But a much more im­por­tant rea­son was the fact that the</p>
    <p>Ger­man gov­ern­ment had the fi­nan­cial re­serves nec­es­sary to prop up its econ­omy. Since March, a stag­ger­ing €1 tril­lion worth of aid was pro­vided, cov­er­ing ev­ery­thing from loans to in­dus­try in or­der to avoid bank­rupt­cies, and up to its gov­ern­ment-funded short-term labour con­tract schemes that kept un­em­ploy­ment low.</p>
    <p>Still, even Europe’s eco­nomic en­gine is not suf­fi­cient to pull the con­ti­nent out of its cur­rent trou­bles: Ger­many’s politi­cians ad­mit that the coun­try’s econ­omy will not be able to reach its pre-pan­demic level be­fore 2022.</p>
