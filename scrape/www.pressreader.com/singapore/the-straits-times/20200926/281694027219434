    <p>DRIVEN BY SENSE OF DUTY</p>
    <p>A nurse is like a soldier. The more sol­diers we can gather, the higher our chances of win­ning. A soldier must go to war, so must I.</p>
    <p>When a pa­tient died of the Mid­dle East res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Mers) in front of her dur­ing an out­break in 2015, nurse Kim Hyun-ah wrote she would “cling on to every pa­tient and never let go, so the an­gel of death can­not take them away”.</p>
    <p>Her let­ter, pub­lished in a ma­jor news­pa­per on J une 15, 2015, moved many to tears.</p>
    <p>In March, three years af­ter she had quit to be­come a writer, Ms Kim re­turned to the front line when Covid-19 broke out in the south-east­ern city of Daegu, where her mother lived.</p>
    <p>It was a time of chaos when the city was fac­ing a short­age of med­i­cal staff and sup­plies as the num­ber of pa­tients sky­rock­eted.</p>
    <p>South Korea was t hen t he sec­ond-most in­fected coun­try af­ter China, and re­ported daily new cases got to as many as 909 in an out­break linked to a lo­cal church.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion in Daegu was re­ally ur­gent and I felt very un­com­fort­able see­ing the news,” Ms Kim, 46, who lives in the Gyeonggi prov­ince sur­round­ing Seoul, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Ju­nior nurses were work­ing in the ICU (in­ten­sive care unit) and they didn’t know how to han­dle the pa­tients. If I went to help, they could take a break and pre­pare for the long fight ahead.”</p>
    <p>There was only one ob­sta­cle – ob­jec­tion from her 70-year-old mother who did not want her daugh­ter to risk her life again.</p>
    <p>“I promised her that I would not get in­fected, and I told her that I may re­gret it for the rest of my life if I didn’t go to Daegu,” said Ms Kim, who has 21 years of ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing in the ICU. “Peo­ple there need me, I have to go.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kim, who is single, spent a month work­ing the night shift as a vol­un­teer in the ICU at Keimyung Univer­sity Dongsan Med­i­cal Cen­tre, one of the first med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties in Daegu to fo­cus on treat­ing coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>By the end of March, South Korea had brought the out­break un­der con­trol with mass test­ing us­ing in­no­va­tions such as driv­ethrough test­ing, and ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily in­fec­tions fell be­low 100, and the coun­try was widely hailed as a role model for suc­cess­fully curb­ing the out­break with­out re­sort­ing to ex­treme mea­sures such as a lock­down.</p>
    <p>Now fight­ing a new wave of in­fec­tions, South Korea has re­ported 23,455 cases of the virus as at yes­ter­day. The num­ber of deaths has reached 395.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim praised the gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts in fight­ing the pan­demic, say­ing that they “did very well” com­pared with the Mers out­break.</p>
    <p>First de­tected in the Mid­dle East in 2012, Mers spread to South Korea in May 2015 through a busi­ness­man fly­ing home from Dubai. The virus spread largely within hos­pi­tals over the next t wo months, killing 20 per cent of 186 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the fa­tal­ity rate was 34 per cent out of 2,519 cases re­ported to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion till Jan 31 this year.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties fum­bled as they had no ex­pe­ri­ence bat­tling an in­fec­tious dis­ease, and new cases were shrouded in se­crecy, trig­ger­ing mass panic.</p>
    <p>The 58-year-old woman who died in her care was the 25th pa­tient and first Mers fa­tal­ity in South Korea.</p>
    <p>“She was so lonely in the ICU and af­ter she died, we covered her with a white cloth and waited un­til gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials came to col­lect her body for cre­ma­tion. No one could see or touch her.”</p>
    <p>Her death shook Ms Kim so much that she started to keep a di­ary of her feel­ings, which cul­mi­nated in the let­ter to JoongAng Ilbo news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus, how­ever, fam­ily mem­bers have at l east been able to view the bod­ies of their loved ones, ac­cord­ing to Ms Kim. She re­called the death of a 46-year-old man who had caught the virus from his older brother, a worker in a small hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“I was in the ICU when he died at 4am. We dis­in­fected his body,</p>
    <p>WRITER KIM HYUN-AH, on why she re­turned to nurs­ing when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic broke out.</p>
    <p>shaved his face and brushed his teeth, then put him in a zip­per bag that had a small trans­par­ent seg­ment show­ing his face,” she said.</p>
    <p>“When his fam­ily came, we suited them up and gave them a</p>
    <p>few min­utes to say good­bye. They were cry­ing and scream­ing, but they got to see him one last time, which was the least we could do for them.”</p>
    <p>Work was tough, and she said nurses faced a higher risk of in­fec­tion as they stayed in the ward with pa­tients through­out their shifts, un­like doc­tors, who came three times a day.</p>
    <p>“One nurse took off her mask as she couldn’t breathe well, and next thing we knew, she had caught the virus,” said Ms Kim.</p>
    <p>“I wore a haz­mat suit 42 times. Tak­ing it off is dan­ger­ous be­cause the sur­face could be covered with the virus, so I al­ways had to do it care­fully.”</p>
    <p>But she was mo­ti­vated by fel­low nurses and mem­bers of the pub­lic who left mes­sages of en­cour­age­ment. The rap­port and moral sup­port was very strong, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Kim has since re­turned to life be­fore Covid-19, spend­ing her days writ­ing the script for a drama se­rial based on her per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing as a nurse in the ICU. Film­ing is slated to start later this year, or early next year.</p>
    <p>But she is pre­pared to vol­un­teer again if a ma­jor out­break emerges.</p>
    <p>“Fight­ing the coro­n­avirus is like fight­ing a war,” she said.</p>
    <p>“A nurse is like a soldier. The more sol­diers we can gather, the higher our chances of win­ning. A soldier must go to war, so must I.”</p>
