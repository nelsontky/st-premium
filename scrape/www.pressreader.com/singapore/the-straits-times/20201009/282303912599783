    <p>Par­tic­i­pants of The Straits Times Vir­tual Run’s 17.5km cat­e­gory will be given an ad­di­tional five days to com­plete their race.</p>
    <p>The event, which starts to­day, was sup­posed to end on Oct 18.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the or­gan­is­ers have de­cided to al­low the rac­ing time­frame to be ex­tended to Oct 23. There will be no change to the 175km race pe­riod, which is from Oct 19 to Dec 17.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cal is­sues had made it dif­fi­cult for some par­tic­i­pants to ac­ti­vate their race en­tries on the Move by Liv3ly app ear­lier this week. The app, which is a fit­ness tracker, is the prin­ci­pal tool for par­tic­i­pants to record their progress.</p>
    <p>The high vol­ume of traf­fic when the par­tic­i­pants tried to ac­ti­vate their race en­tries on the app led to many re­ceiv­ing er­ror mes­sages in­stead, lead­ing to a cho­rus of com­plaints on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The is­sue has been re­solved but the or­gan­is­ers are seek­ing to as­sure those who en­coun­tered dif­fi­cul­ties that they will have am­ple time to com­plete their races.</p>
    <p>ST sports editor Lee Yulin, who is the or­gan­is­ing chair­man of the run, said: “We thank our run­ners for their pa­tience over the tech­ni­cal is­sues that some of them ex­pe­ri­enced ear­lier this week and apol­o­gise for the in­con­ve­nience caused.</p>
    <p>“We want to let those who ex­pe­ri­enced prob­lems us­ing the app know that they will still be able to sub­mit their race de­tails to us when they have fin­ished.”</p>
    <p>Over 14,000 run­ning en­thu­si­asts have signed up for the in­au­gu­ral event, which this year replaces the an­nual ST Run. The dis­tances – 17.5km and 175km – have been com­mis­sioned to mark the 175th an­niver­sary of the news­pa­per.</p>
