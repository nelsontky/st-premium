    <p>Aus­tralia may block China Meng­niu Dairy from buy­ing some of the coun­try’s best-known milk brands, the Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view re­ported yes­ter­day, cit­ing uniden­ti­fied sources who blamed “diplo­matic is­sues”.</p>
    <p>Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg went against the ad­vice of the For­eign In­vest­ment Re­view Board (FIRB), which was in favour of ap­prov­ing the A$600 mil­lion (S$588 mil­lion) deal, the news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>That would mark the first gov­ern­ment veto since Aus­tralia last month an­nounced its big­gest shake-up of for­eign in­vest­ment law in half a cen­tury, which gave the Trea­surer last-re­sort power to vary or im­pose con­di­tions on deals in the event of a na­tional se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>The re­vi­sion came partly in re­sponse to fear that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic’s eco­nomic im­pact would make buy­ing strate­gic as­sets eas­ier for cashed-up for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>China Meng­niu’s ap­proach also came against a back­drop of ris­ing bi­lat­eral ten­sions after Aus­tralia called for an in­ter­na­tional in­quiry into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus, which was first re­ported in China.</p>
    <p>China Meng­niu of­fered to buy Lion Dairy & Drinks from Ja­pan’s Kirin Hold­ings last Novem­ber, 10 days after re­ceiv­ing the FIRB’s ap­proval to buy in­fant for­mula maker Bel­lamy’s for A$1.43 bil­lion. It gained ap­proval for the Lion deal in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment does not com­ment on the de­tails of for­eign in­vest­ment screen­ing ar­range­ments,” Mr Fry­den­berg said in re­sponse to ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Queens­land Lib­eral Na­tional Party agri­cul­ture spokesman Tony Per­rett had in March writ­ten to him about milk sup­ply con­cerns with the Meng­niu deal, stat­ing “grave con­cern about ma­jor food pro­ces­sor brands be­ing bought by Chi­nese firms with close ties to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment”.</p>
