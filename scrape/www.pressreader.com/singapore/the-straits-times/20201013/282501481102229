    <p>The Ja­panese have a term, “tsun­doku”, which refers to the act of ac­quir­ing books and let­ting them pile up with­out read­ing them. It’s com­fort­ing to know this af­flic­tion has a name, es­pe­cially one that sounds more so­phis­ti­cated than “bib­lio­ma­nia” or “book hoard­ing”.</p>
    <p>The books I own say some­thing about the sort of per­son I am or as­pire to be. Those that lan­guish un­read speak to res­o­lu­tions made that have, well, since been shelved. Among them are Jin Yong’s Fly­ing Fox Of Snowy Moun­tain, which I had been mean­ing to read since the au­thor’s death two years ago. I have yet to crack open my copies of Neil Gaiman’s The Ocean At</p>
    <p>The End Of The Lane and Lionel Shriver’s The Mandibles, which I’d taken the trou­ble to get signed at fes­ti­vals. Charles Dick­ens’ Bleak House sits glumly on my desk, re­mind­ing me of some­thing a pro­fes­sor once told me, in mild re­proach: “Don’t let too many years of your life go by with­out read­ing Bleak House.”</p>
    <p>Tsun­doku, or at least my fas­ci­na­tion with it, was what led me to The Li­brary of Un­read Books at Ex­cel­sior Shop­ping Cen­tre two week­ends ago. I found my­self in good com­pany. Books un­read by their pre­vi­ous own­ers were ar­ranged in neat, seem­ingly ran­dom piles on ta­bles in a tiny base­ment shopfront.</p>
    <p>“Our tagline for the li­brary is:</p>
    <p>‘If you have an un­read book, please do­nate it to us and some­one else will read it for you,’” says artist He­man Chong, who started the project in 2016 with ar­chiv­ist Re­nee Staal, af­ter they were struck by how many un­read books their friends had.</p>
    <p>The itin­er­ant li­brary be­gan in earnest dur­ing his res­i­dency at the NTU Cen­tre for Con­tem­po­rary Art Sin­ga­pore (NTU CCA), where it was first dis­played. It is now in its eighth it­er­a­tion and has trav­elled to cities from Utrecht to Dubai and Manila to Mi­lan, with more than 2,000 ti­tles (and count­ing), all do­nated by mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>You can’t take books out on loan, but you can walk in and browse the col­lec­tion. Ev­ery book bears the name of its donor and some have left hand­writ­ten notes. Writer Amanda Lee Koe, who do­nated Ber­trand Rus­sell’s The Prob­lems Of Phi­los­o­phy, quips in a pen­cil in­scrip­tion that she is giv­ing it up “cos I’ve got enough nonon­to­log­i­cal prob­lems of my own”.</p>
    <p>Hand-pick­ing a book is a per­for­ma­tive act. The donors are cu­ra­tors of the li­brary – or anti-cu­ra­tors, re­nounc­ing ti­tles they don’t care for.</p>
    <p>What they are re­ally cu­rat­ing, of course, is their im­age of them­selves, al­though the project’s col­lec­tive na­ture means it does not hold a mir­ror to any one per­son’s van­ity.</p>
    <p>A de­sire to seem “cool” might ex­plain the many pop­u­lar best­sellers on dis­play – Fifty</p>
    <p>Shades Of Grey, The Da Vinci Code and Kazuo Ishig­uro’s Never Let Me Go. Or the dusty clas­sics by dead white men, such as James Joyce’s Ulysses and Lau­rence Sterne’s</p>
    <p>The Life And Opin­ions Of Tris­tram Shandy, Gen­tle­man. Other ti­tles are more ob­scure, such as guides on palm­istry and civic or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>I no­tice a con­sid­er­able lack of SingLit, with a few ex­cep­tions, such as Jo­hann S. Lee’s LGBT (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, and trans­gen­der) novel Pe­cu­liar Chris.</p>
    <p>At least one au­thor has walked in to find his book among the un­read, Chong says. Ger­man writer Ingo Nier­mann vis­ited the li­brary in Utrecht. “Oh, I wrote this,” he said, point­ing to his book So­lu­tion 264-274: Drill Na­tion.</p>
    <p>The Li­brary Of Un­read Books raises ques­tions about the value of un­read books, re­call­ing a well-known es­say by Um­berto Eco, who had a vast pri­vate li­brary and was of­ten asked by vis­i­tors if he had read it all.</p>
    <p>“It could be said,” Eco mused, “that they are still peo­ple who con­sider a book­shelf as a mere stor­age place for al­ready-read books and do not think of the li­brary as a work­ing tool.</p>
    <p>“But there is more to it than that. I be­lieve that, con­fronted by a vast ar­ray of books, any­one will be seized by the an­guish of learn­ing, and will in­evitably lapse into ask­ing the ques­tion that ex­presses his tor­ment and his re­morse.”</p>
    <p>The an­guish of learn­ing, in­deed. Some peo­ple travel to the</p>
    <p>Grand Canyon to pon­der their in­signif­i­cance in the world – all I have to do is visit my lo­cal li­brary. Sur­rounded by hun­dreds of thou­sands of books I know I will never read in my life­time, I feel pro­foundly moved, as well as the thrill of hav­ing so much knowl­edge at my fin­ger­tips.</p>
    <p>At its heart, tsun­doku is a fun­da­men­tally hope­ful and hope­lessly op­ti­mistic en­ter­prise. Be­hind each un­read book lies vast pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Chong tells me that The Li­brary Of Un­read Books – call it a cross be­tween con­cep­tual art and a pub­lic pro­gramme – has nine edi­tions, one of which has been ac­quired by the Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum (SAM). Chong is in talks with other mu­se­ums – or “hosts”, as he calls them – which will also start their own li­braries from scratch.</p>
    <p>He ex­plains: “What SAM is col­lect­ing is the in­struc­tions to run a li­brary – how to set it up, how to col­lect the books... The Li­brary Of Un­read Books is not ex­clu­sively a phys­i­cal li­brary. It is an idea... Any­one and ev­ery­one can start their own li­brary of un­read books. That is our fi­nal goal, which is to see this idea ger­mi­nate.</p>
    <p>“If we have nine li­braries (of un­read books) around the world and, due to global warm­ing, one gets flooded, we would still have eight.”</p>
    <p>In many ways, the li­brary is a bul­wark against ob­so­les­cence. Its books might even out­live the ones which peo­ple choose to keep on their shelves. Slowly but surely, the li­brary of un­read books might just about turn into its op­po­site.</p>
