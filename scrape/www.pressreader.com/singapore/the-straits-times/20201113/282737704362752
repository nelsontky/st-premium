    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Just pay at­ten­tion and ev­ery­thing should make sense, though it may take longer than you would like. It is hard to force the truth out of any­one.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Travel could be on your mind, or maybe just ex­po­sure to dif­fer­ent cul­tures. That may be pos­si­ble in your lo­cal­ity, so head out and see what you can find.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy level is high and you should be able to push through to some­thing new and ex­cit­ing. It is a re­ally good time for you to ex­plore new top­ics and ideas.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Life is hard, but that does not mean you should give up. See if you can get your peo­ple to pitch in. You should have plenty of favours you can call in.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Be sure to speak up. Peo­ple are likely to agree with you even on con­tentious is­sues. They are sym­pa­thetic to your point of view, so take ad­van­tage of it.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You can­not de­cide be­tween two cour­ses of ac­tion and that could haunt you all day. Try to live with no re­grets, or you may sec­ond-guess your­self for­ever.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are strik­ing a new bal­ance be­tween work, fam­ily and the rest of your life. It is a good time to set lim­its, but it is also a great time to stay flex­i­ble.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing a pull from an odd di­rec­tion, so go with it. A mes­sage from sub­lim­i­nal chan­nels is not al­ways sin­is­ter. Find out where this one leads.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You find it hard to make de­ci­sions. Try not to worry about it. You just have to shoot from the hip from time to time. Make the call and move on.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You could face a chal­lenge, but it brings with it an op­por­tu­nity. See if you can push through what­ever is in your way to find what you can take for your­self.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your per­sonal life is mak­ing things more in­ter­est­ing, so see if you can fo­cus on that. Work and com­mu­nity is­sues can wait for at least one more day, right?</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing more op­ti­mistic af­ter to­day. Lit­tle im­prove­ments add up to some­thing big and you should be able to get even more out of life.</p>
