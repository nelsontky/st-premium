    <p>READ­ING (Penn­syl­va­nia) • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den and their top sur­ro­gates bar­relled through cru­cial states in the in­dus­trial Mid­west and coastal south-east on Satur­day, press­ing clos­ing ar­gu­ments in a fran­tic sprint days ahead of the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Us­ing some of his most ur­gent lan­guage yet, Mr Trump warned of “bed­lam in our coun­try” if no clear win­ner emerges quickly in to­mor­row’s elec­tion, say­ing – with­out ev­i­dence – that it could take weeks to sort out a re­sult and that “very bad things” could hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, mean­while, told back­ers it was “time for Don­ald Trump to pack his bags and go home”.</p>
    <p>Un­der­scor­ing the high stakes, a record 90 mil­lion early votes have al­ready been cast, as the bruis­ing con­test heads towards the big­gest turnout in at least a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of early vot­ers ac­counts for about 65 per cent of the to­tal turnout in 2016.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion is tak­ing place in a deeply di­vided coun­try, with feel­ings so raw that gun sales have surged in some ar­eas.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Mr Trump was</p>
    <p>fo­cused on the key bat­tle­ground state of Penn­syl­va­nia. He was set to stage 10 ral­lies yes­ter­day and to­day, aim­ing to gen­er­ate enough mo­men­tum to drive an over­whelm­ing turnout by his sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Also on Satur­day, Mr Bi­den made his first joint ap­pear­ance of the cam­paign with his for­mer boss Barack Obama in Flint, Michi­gan, as they scram­bled to boost turnout in a state Mr Trump car­ried by a ra­zor-thin mar­gin in 2016.</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia has emerged as one of the top prizes this year.</p>
    <p>In But­ler, Penn­syl­va­nia, Mr Trump ar­rived at a rally with over 5,000 peo­ple crammed in – few wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Stan­ford Univer­sity economists es­ti­mated in a study last week that 18 of Mr Trump’s cam­paign ral­lies had re­sulted in more than 30,000 coron­avirus cases and over 700 deaths – although not nec­es­sar­ily among at­ten­dees – based on sta­tis­ti­cal mod­el­ling.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent is hop­ing to pull off an­other shock re­sult like in 2016.</p>
    <p>Sup­porter Jeff Close, who at­tended a Trump rally in Read­ing, Penn­syl­va­nia, said Mr Trump “has done more for this coun­try than any pres­i­dent”. “He’s kept his word – prom­ises made, prom­ises kept.”</p>
