    <p>• A new study that an­a­lysed the Covid-19 out­break in Brazil has found a link be­tween the spread of the coro­n­avirus and past out­breaks of dengue fever, sug­gest­ing ex­po­sure to the mos­quito-trans­mit­ted ill­ness may pro­vide some level of im­mu­nity against the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The as-yet-un­pub­lished study, led by Duke Univer­sity’s Pro­fes­sor Miguel Ni­colelis and shared ex­clu­sively with Reuters, com­pared the geo­graphic dis­tri­bu­tion of coro­n­avirus cases with the spread of dengue last year and this year.</p>
    <p>Places with lower coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates and slower case growth were lo­ca­tions that had suf­fered in­tense dengue out­breaks this year or last, the study found.</p>
    <p>“This strik­ing find­ing raises the in­trigu­ing pos­si­bil­ity of an im­muno­log­i­cal cross-re­ac­tiv­ity be­tween dengue’s Fla­vivirus serotypes and Sars-CoV-2,” said the study, re­fer­ring to dengue virus an­ti­bod­ies and Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“If proven cor­rect, this hy­poth­e­sis could mean that dengue in­fec­tion or im­mu­ni­sa­tion with an ef­fi­ca­cious and safe dengue vac­cine could pro­duce some level of im­muno­log­i­cal pro­tec­tion” against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Prof Ni­colelis told Reuters the re­sults are par­tic­u­larly in­ter­est­ing be­cause pre­vi­ous stud­ies have shown that peo­ple with dengue an­ti­bod­ies i n their blood can test falsely pos­i­tive for Covid-19 an­ti­bod­ies, even if they have never been in­fected by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“This in­di­cates that there is an im­muno­log­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion be­tween (the) two viruses that no­body could have expected, be­cause the two viruses are from com­pletely dif­fer­ent fam­i­lies,” Prof Ni­colelis said, adding that fur­ther stud­ies are needed to prove the con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>The study will be pub­lished ahead of peer re­view on the MedRxiv pre-print server and will be sub­mit­ted to a sci­en­tific jour­nal.</p>
    <p>It high­lights a sig­nif­i­cant cor­re­la­tion be­tween l ower in­ci­dence, mor­tal­ity and growth rate of Covid-19 in pop­u­la­tions in Brazil where the lev­els of an­ti­bod­ies to dengue were higher.</p>
    <p>In states such as Parana, Santa Cata­rina, Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso do Sul and Mi­nas Gerais, which had a high in­ci­dence of dengue last year and ear­lier this year, Covid-19 took much longer to reach a level of high community trans­mis­sion com­pared with states such as Amapa, Maran­hao and Para that had fewer dengue cases.</p>
    <p>The re­search team found a sim­i­lar re­la­tion­ship i n other parts of Latin Amer­ica, as well as Asia and is­lands in the Pa­cific and In­dian Oceans.</p>
    <p>Prof Ni­colelis said his team came across the dengue dis­cov­ery by ac­ci­dent dur­ing a study on how Covid-19 had spread in Brazil, in which they found that high­ways played a ma­jor role in the dis­tri­bu­tion of cases.</p>
    <p>Af­ter iden­ti­fy­ing cer­tain case­free spots on the map, the team went in search of pos­si­ble ex­pla­na­tions. A break­through came when the team com­pared the spread of dengue with that of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
