    <p>You have 15 min­utes with your child’s form teacher dur­ing the year-end par­ent-teacher meet­ing. How do you make the most of this pre­cious time?</p>
    <p>First, make time to at­tend the ses­sion, no mat­ter how brief, says Ms Jose­lyn Loh, man­ager of Par­ent­ing Sup­port Ser­vices at Care Cor­ner Sin­ga­pore, a non-profit so­cial ser­vice agency. The teacher is a “very sig­nif­i­cant per­son” in your child’s life who can give you a dif­fer­ent per­spec­tive and help you un­der­stand your kid bet­ter, she adds.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu Kah Yang, year head of Bart­ley Sec­ondary School, says the par­ent-teacher meet­ing is also a good op­por­tu­nity to see how your child has de­vel­oped holis­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>“Some par­ents tend to place more fo­cus on their chil­dren’s aca­demic set­backs and ne­glect strides that they have made in other im­por­tant as­pects, such as their chil­dren’s good at­ten­dance in school, their ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion in CCA and pos­i­tive char­ac­ter traits, es­pe­cially if their strengths/growth in such as­pects have also been pointed out by the teach­ers.”</p>
    <p>He sug­gests ask­ing ques­tions such as these: How is my child in­ter­act­ing with his or her peers and teach­ers?</p>
    <p>What is my child’s at­ti­tude to­wards learn­ing? What has the school done to help my child to learn and grow, and how can I re­in­force this at home?</p>
    <p>What are my child’s strengths and what is he or she re­ally good at in school? What is he or she most pas­sion­ate about?</p>
    <p>• What ar­eas will my child need to work on to help him or her to learn and grow?</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Su-Lynn, a se­nior ed­u­ca­tional psy­chol­o­gist with Prom­ises Health­care, adds that fos­ter­ing strong ties with your child’s teacher dur­ing the school year en­sures con­sis­tency be­tween what your child ex­pe­ri­ences at home and in school.</p>
    <p>“The more you know about your child’s needs, the more you can help him or her.”</p>
