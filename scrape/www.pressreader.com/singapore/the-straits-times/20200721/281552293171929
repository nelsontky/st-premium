    <p>A grow­ing wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Hong Kong has forced schools to ex­tend clo­sures and civil ser­vants to re­turn to work­ing from home, amid fears that the city may be put un­der a par­tial lock­down to con­tain the spread of the dis­ease. Hong Kong recorded 73 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A fresh wave of coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sions has forced the Hong Kong author­i­ties to ex­tend school clo­sures and raised fears of the city be­ing placed un­der par­tial lock­down.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties said yes­ter­day that Hong Kong recorded 73 new cases, in­clud­ing 66 lo­cal trans­mis­sions in mahjong par­lours and restau­rants, con­tin­u­ing a trend that be­gan a month ago when so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were re­laxed and the cap on pub­lic gath­er­ings raised from eight to 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions now stands at 1,958, of which 557 lo­cal cases have been recorded over the past two weeks, putting Hong Kong’s health­care sys­tem and econ­omy un­der se­vere stress.</p>
    <p>Civil ser­vants, who had been back in their of­fices since May, re­turned to work­ing from home yes­ter­day and will do so for at least one week.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ed­u­ca­tion Sec­re­tary Kevin Ye­ung an­nounced that all pub­lic and pri­vate schools will start their new aca­demic year later, in the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>“We an­tic­i­pate at this stage that classes of all schools, in­clud­ing in­ter­na­tional schools and kinder­gartens, which used to start their new school year early, would not com­mence ear­lier than Aug 17,” Mr Ye­ung said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy ex­pert Yuen Kwok Yung warned yes­ter­day in a lo­cal ra­dio pro­gramme that the city might have to go into par­tial lock­down if the surge in coro­n­avirus cases con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>“We might pos­si­bly need to lock down, not a lock­down of the whole city, but... close to a lock­down,” Pro­fes­sor Yuen said.</p>
    <p>As it is, Covid-19 test­ing fa­cil­i­ties in the city are swamped, with many pri­vate hos­pi­tals re­port­edly fully booked af­ter they were roped in to meet soar­ing de­mand for the tests.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor David Hui of the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong said mem­bers of the pub­lic had let their guard down re­cently, and warned that pub­lic hos­pi­tals would be un­der im­mense pres­sure if the daily num­ber of new Covid-19 cases con­tin­ues to hit three dig­its.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hong Kong Univer­sity mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist Ho Pak Le­ung cau­tioned that the quar­an­tine cen­tres are al­most full, with only 196 units left for im­me­di­ate use.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam on Sun­day de­scribed the sit­u­a­tion as “re­ally crit­i­cal” and or­dered face masks to be made com­pul­sory for those vis­it­ing in­door venues such as su­per­mar­kets and wet mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is plan­ning to build an­other 2,000 quar­an­tine units in Lan­tau, on top of the planned 1,500 units, Mrs Lam said. About 700 units were pro­jected to be avail­able this week.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Hong Kong hit a record num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in a day at 108, of which 83 were lo­cally trans­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties have put tighter mea­sures in place to counter the spread, for ex­am­ple, clos­ing bars and gyms, mak­ing it manda­tory to wear masks on pub­lic trans­port and hav­ing restau­rants do only take­outs from 6pm.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s econ­omy is ex­pected to take an­other hit. It shrank by 8.9 per cent year on year – its worst de­cline on record – in the first quar­ter, but an­a­lysts had hoped for an up­turn once so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were re­laxed.</p>
    <p>This new wave of i nfec­tion threat­ens any re­bound, de­spite gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies and re­lief mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The job­less rate last month was the high­est in more than 15 years, with the econ­omy bat­tered by the pan­demic and the sour­ing ties between China and the United States.</p>
    <p>The loom­ing risks of a lock­down will only worsen mat­ters, an­a­lysts said.</p>
