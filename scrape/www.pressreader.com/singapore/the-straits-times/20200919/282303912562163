    <p>With ma­tu­rity and the right dis­tance, trainer Ja­son Lim is hop­ing his Race 12 run­ner, Takhi, can bounce back at Kranji to­day.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean han­dler be­lieves his US$23,500 (S$32,000) pur­chase has po­ten­tial, af­ter the three-year-old’s sur­prise de­but win on Feb 21.</p>
    <p>That day, he was more op­ti­mistic about his other new­comer, Crys­tal Dragon, in the Re­stricted Maiden event over the Poly­track 1,200m.</p>
    <p>But it was his “sec­ond stringer” that de­liv­ered the good­ies.</p>
    <p>Crys­tal Dragon fin­ished last in the eight-horse field af­ter be­ing well up in the race.</p>
    <p>Takhi may have dis­ap­pointed in his next three starts over 1,200m and 1,400m on turf and Poly­track, but he has re­turned to form.</p>
    <p>The re­moval of blink­ers and the in­crease in dis­tance to the Poly­track 1,600m sparked his trans­for­ma­tion in his last start on Sept 5.</p>
    <p>Un­like his de­but come-from-be­hind vic­tory, he raced on the pace and just failed to catch Leather­head by 11/ lengths in Class 4.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>The Takhi that Lim has time for is back. This gives him some con­fi­dence in to­day’s Poly 1,600m in Race 12. Gate 2 is a bonus.</p>
    <p>“I used to run him in sprint races, but I think his first-up win over 1,200m was also a sign he needs fur­ther,” said retired trainer David Hill’s for­mer deputy.</p>
    <p>“I think we got the right dis­tance for Takhi now. He’s also be­come more ma­ture.</p>
    <p>“He’s al­ways shown a cer­tain keen­ness in his track­work. I took the blink­ers off at his last start and he wasn’t so keen.</p>
    <p>“He jumped well and landed be­hind Leather­head, who is a very good horse. He showed a good turn of foot.</p>
    <p>“He’s drawn nicely in two. I think he’s got a good chance.”</p>
    <p>Lim, who is in joint-10th place with Donna Lo­gan in the train­ers’ log with 13 win­ners, la­belled Takhi “quite a pro­gres­sive horse”.</p>
    <p>“With­out get­ting too ahead of my­self, if he keeps go­ing through his grades, I may look at a fea­ture race for him, when he is four years old next year,” he said.</p>
    <p>“One race at a time, though, let’s see how he goes this Satur­day first.”</p>
    <p>Takhi will be rid­den by jockey John Sun­dradas to­day.</p>
