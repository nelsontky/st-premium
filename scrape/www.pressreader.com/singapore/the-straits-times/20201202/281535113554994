    <p>Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas has warned against hurtling down the path of de­cou­pling, as the Euro­pean Union and the United States’ in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion ex­plore the op­tion of forg­ing a com­mon front to deal with what is seen as the “China threat”. But cau­tion aside, Mr Maas saw the logic in a joint US-EU ap­proach on China.</p>
    <p>As the Euro­pean Union and the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion ex­plore the op­tion of forg­ing a com­mon front to deal with what is seen as the “China threat”, Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas has struck a note of cau­tion, warn­ing against hurtling down the path of de­cou­pling.</p>
    <p>“The world al­ready has two poles: North and South, there is no need for an­other two in the East and the West,” he said in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with The Straits Times from Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nan­cial Times on Mon­day re­ported that the EU will call on the United States to seize a “on­cein-a-gen­er­a­tion” op­por­tu­nity to forge a new global al­liance to meet the “strate­gic chal­lenge” posed by China. It cited a draft Euro­pean Com­mis­sion plan to re­build their part­ner­ship that pro­posed widerang­ing co­op­er­a­tion, in­clud­ing on dig­i­tal reg­u­la­tion and tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Amid anx­i­eties in Asia that the com­ing to­gether of the US and EU could usher in a new Cold War and pro­voke a re­ac­tion from a hemmed-in China, Mr Maas sug­gested that in­clu­sive­ness could be an el­e­ment of the crys­tallis­ing joint ap­proach. “In the last cou­ple of years, China has suc­cess­fully filled a vac­uum the United States left in the re­gion. De­cou­pling of China and the US, how­ever, does not take us any­where,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ar­gu­ing against more po­lar­i­sa­tion, he added: “We build on di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and in­clu­sive­ness as a guide­line in our Asia pol­icy and strongly be­lieve if we have joint goals, we also have to pur­sue them to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Cau­tion aside, Mr Maas saw the logic in a joint US-EU ap­proach on China, not­ing their shared com­mon ob­jec­tives vis-a-vis Bei­jing – both pro­moted hu­man rights, the rule of law, free and fair mar­ket ac­cess as well as free and open mar­itime routes.</p>
    <p>The decades-old transat­lantic con­sen­sus has frayed, how­ever, as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion pur­sued an “Amer­ica-first” pol­icy and launched a uni­lat­eral trade war with China. For Europe, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s trade war with China felt like it was be­ing forced to ride a tiger, Mr Maas said. The net ef­fect was that it left con­sumers and busi­nesses worse off.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body loses in wars. This is also true for trade wars,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The con­flict with China has ham­pered the con­fi­dence of con­sumers and in­vestors. Our economies are all in­ter­con­nected through sup­ply and value chains.</p>
    <p>“We must re­vive our spirit of co­op­er­a­tion in or­der to jump off the tiger we have been forced to mount.”</p>
    <p>How the US and EU join forces to tackle the pan­demic could be an early bench­mark for transat­lantic ties, he sug­gested.</p>
    <p>“We want to re­new the transat­lantic bond and re­dou­ble our ef­forts in ar­eas of mu­tual in­ter­est, based on the val­ues we share,” he said, talk­ing about Ger­many’s pri­or­ity ar­eas in the first 100 days af­ter the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion takes over on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>“A quick test for transat­lantic co­op­er­a­tion will be our han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many, which cur­rently holds the ro­tat­ing EU pres­i­dency, has sought to unify di­ver­gent views within Europe on how to re­late with an in­creas­ingly as­sertive China.</p>
    <p>“The Euro­pean Union of­ten looks at China as a part­ner, a com­peti­tor and a sys­temic ri­val,” Mr Maas said.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to be able to suc­cess­fully ad­vo­cate for our in­ter­ests and de­fend our be­liefs vis-a-vis China, we must take a firm stance to­gether. Strength­en­ing our unity within the EU is a key pri­or­ity of Ger­many’s cur­rent EU Coun­cil pres­i­dency.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the for­eign min­is­ters of EU and Asean held a vir­tual meet­ing and up­graded their ties to a strate­gic part­ner­ship. A state­ment is­sued af­ter the event did not elab­o­rate on its scope.</p>
    <p>Mr Maas told The Straits Times that decades of steady eco­nomic growth had grad­u­ally shifted the bal­ance of power from the Euro-At­lantic to the Indo-Pa­cific. “The shape of to­mor­row’s in­ter­na­tional or­der will be de­cided in the Indo-Pa­cific,” he said. “It is in our strate­gic in­ter­est to up­grade our en­gage­ment in the re­gion and to in­ten­sify our co­op­er­a­tion with the Indo-Pa­cific – with Asean and its mem­ber states at the cen­tre.”</p>
    <p>The re­cently signed Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) – which creates the world’s largest free trade area link­ing Asean with China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and New Zealand – was good news for mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism as it strength­ens rules-based trade, he said. It would also serve up new busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties for Euro­pean com­pa­nies in RCEP coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Europe is ex­pand­ing eco­nomic ties to the re­gion, on top of its free trade pacts with Sin­ga­pore, Viet­nam, Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully also with Asean, as a whole, in a not too dis­tant fu­ture,” Mr Maas said.</p>
