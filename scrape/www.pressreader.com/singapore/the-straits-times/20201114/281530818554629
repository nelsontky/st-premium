    <p>•</p>
    <p>Hours af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­peated a base­less re­port that a vot­ing ma­chine sys­tem “deleted 2.7 mil­lion Trump votes na­tion­wide”, he was di­rectly con­tra­dicted by a group of fed­eral, state and lo­cal election of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>They is­sued a state­ment declar­ing flatly that the election “was the most se­cure in Amer­i­can his­tory” and that “there is no ev­i­dence” any vot­ing sys­tems were com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>The re­buke, in a state­ment on Thurs­day by a co­or­di­nat­ing coun­cil over­see­ing the vot­ing sys­tems used around the coun­try, never men­tioned Mr Trump by name.</p>
    <p>But it amounted to a re­mark­able cor­rec­tive to a wave of dis­in­for­ma­tion that Mr Trump has been push­ing in his Twit­ter feed.</p>
    <p>The state­ment was dis­trib­uted by the De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity’s Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fras­truc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency, which is re­spon­si­ble for help­ing states se­cure the vot­ing process.</p>
    <p>Com­ing di­rectly from one of Mr Trump’s own Cabi­net agen­cies, it fur­ther iso­lated the Pres­i­dent in his false claims that wide­spread fraud cost him the election.</p>
    <p>The state­ment also came as a pre­vi­ously uni­fied Repub­li­can Party showed signs of crack­ing on the ques­tion of whether to keep back­ing the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Across the coun­try, election of­fi­cials have said the vote came off smoothly, with no re­ports of sys­temic fraud in any state, no sign of for­eign in­ter­fer­ence in the vot­ing in­fras­truc­ture and no hard­ware or soft­ware fail­ures be­yond the episodic glitches that hap­pen in any election.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s lead in the pop­u­lar vote has ex­panded to more than five mil­lion.</p>
    <p>He re­mains on track to win a solid vic­tory in the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>The group that is­sued the state­ment was the Elec­tions In­fras­truc­ture Gov­ern­ment Co­or­di­nat­ing Coun­cil, which in­cludes top of­fi­cials from the cy­ber se­cu­rity agency, the US Election As­sis­tance Com­mis­sion and sec­re­taries of state and state election di­rec­tors from around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The group also in­cludes rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the vot­ing ma­chine in­dus­try, which has of­ten been ac­cused of be­ing slow to ad­mit to tech­no­log­i­cal shortcomin­gs and re­sis­tant to cre­at­ing pa­per back­ups.</p>
    <p>“While we know there are many un­founded claims and op­por­tu­ni­ties for mis­in­for­ma­tion about the process of our elec­tions, we can as­sure you we have the ut­most con­fi­dence in the se­cu­rity and in­tegrity of our elec­tions, and you should, too,” the of­fi­cials added in their state­ment.</p>
    <p>“When you have ques­tions, turn to election of­fi­cials as trusted voices as they ad­min­is­ter elec­tions.”</p>
    <p>This year, in part be­cause of the vastly in­creased use of mail-in bal­lots, over 92 per cent of votes had some form of pa­per backup that can be used in au­dits or re­counts.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil was re­spon­si­ble only for the se­cu­rity of the ac­tual election in­fras­truc­ture – the vot­ing ma­chines, the scan­ners and the count­ing sys­tems for bal­lots.</p>
    <p>So its state­ment did not en­com­pass the full range of Mr Trump’s ac­cu­sa­tions – re­but­ted by election of­fi­cials across the coun­try – of other types of vot­ing fraud, most no­tably that mail-in bal­lots were ma­nip­u­lated to give an ad­van­tage to Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil’s state­ment on Thurs­day was prompted by re­peated “base­less claims of voter fraud that none of us have seen any ev­i­dence of”, said Mr Ben­jamin Hov­land, one of the fed­eral of­fi­cials who signed it.</p>
    <p>He is chair of the US Election As­sis­tance Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Na­tional Com­mit­tee spokesman Lily Adams said: “It has al­ways been clear that this election was free, fair and se­cure, and now even Trump’s own De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity has factchecke­d his lies.”</p>
