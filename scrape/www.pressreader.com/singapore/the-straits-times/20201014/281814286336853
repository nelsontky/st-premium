    <p>In­dia has rolled out a new cam­paign to re­mind peo­ple not to let their guard down, as ex­perts warn that fa­tigue over the pan­demic, cou­pled with the com­ing fes­tive sea­son and win­ter, could re­sult in a spike in cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Jan An­dolan (Peo­ple Move­ment) drive for Covid-19 ap­pro­pri­ate be­hav­iour in­cludes putting up posters ask­ing peo­ple to wear masks and fol­low other safety steps in places like rail­way sta­tions and mar­kets, print­ing safety in­struc­tions on util­ity bills and get­ting celebri­ties to tweet safe prac­tices.</p>
    <p>In a re­minder to his 41.6 mil­lion Twit­ter fans, Bol­ly­wood ac­tor Sal­man Khan tweeted “... only do three things”, urg­ing them to keep a six-feet (1.8m) safe dis­tance, wear a mask and sani­tise their hands.</p>
    <p>Launched last week, the cam­paign comes as In­dia counts down to the fes­tive sea­son – in­clud­ing Dussehra on Oct 25 and Deep­avali cel­e­bra­tions from Nov 13 to 15 – and record fall­ing tem­per­a­tures in the north, both of which threaten the cur­rent down­ward trend in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>With al­most 7.2 mil­lion cases of Covid-19, In­dia has the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of in­fec­tions af­ter the United States which has more than 8 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>In­dia had one of the most strin­gent lock­downs in the world, shut­ting down all eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity when there were a few hun­dred cases in March. But as re­stric­tions loos­ened, the num­ber of cases rose till they hit nearly a mil­lion new cases a day in mid-Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Over the past two weeks, how­ever, there has been a down­ward trend, with 55,342 new cases recorded on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Still, the author­i­ties are gear­ing up for the fes­ti­val sea­son when large gath­er­ings are the norm.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol has warned that the cap­i­tal New Delhi, for in­stance, needs to be pre­pared for 15,000 new cases of Covid-19 ev­ery day due to res­pi­ra­tory prob­lems triggered by win­ter pol­lu­tion and fes­tive gath­er­ings. The daily rise in cases in the cap­i­tal now is fewer than 2,000, with 1,849 fresh cases on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>A poll of 18 cities by non-profit group EkDesh and re­search firm</p>
    <p>Crownit in Septem­ber found that only 44 per cent of In­di­ans were wear­ing a mask even though aware­ness lev­els about masks were at a high of 90 per cent. Fifty per cent did not wear masks be­cause they had breath­ing trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts said the cam­paign would need to be tai­lor-made for dif­fer­ent ar­eas, from ur­ban to ru­ral.</p>
    <p>“The cam­paign faces the triple chal­lenge of fes­ti­vals, fa­tigue and fa­tal­ism,” said Pro­fes­sor Ra­jib Das­gupta of the cen­tre for so­cial medicine and com­mu­nity health at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>But with­out a more tar­geted ap­proach cater­ing to dif­fer­ent groups, he said, the cam­paign “will have lim­ited pow­ers in trans­lat­ing into a jan an­dolan”.</p>
