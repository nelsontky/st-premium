    <p>Mr Jack Ma is a very busy man. China’s rich­est man has been busy launch­ing the world’s big­gest ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO). He has been busy pre­par­ing for Alibaba Group Hold­ing’s grand­est four-day Dou­ble Eleven shop­ping ex­trav­a­ganza.</p>
    <p>And yet two weeks ago, Mr Ma some­how found the time to opine on China’s bank­ing sys­tem at a high-pro­file fi­nan­cial fo­rum in Shang­hai, once again throw­ing him­self into the eye of the storm.</p>
    <p>In that speech, apart from la­belling the global bank­ing Basel Ac­cords as an “old peo­ple’s club”, he said “sys­temic risk” is not the is­sue in China.</p>
    <p>Rather, China’s big­gest risk is that it “lacks a fi­nan­cial ecosys­tem”. Chi­nese banks are like “pawn shops”, where col­lat­eral and guar­an­tees are the hard currencies. As a re­sult, some de­cided to go so big they are not al­lowed to fail.</p>
    <p>“As the Chi­nese like to say, if you bor­row 100,000 yuan (S$20,300) from the bank, you are a bit scared. If you bor­row a mil­lion yuan, both you and the bank are a lit­tle ner­vous. But if you take a 1 bil­lion yuan loan, you are not scared at all. The bank is,” Mr Ma said.</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences came this week. On Mon­day, Bei­jing’s top fi­nan­cial watch­dogs sum­moned Mr Ma and dressed him down.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing also is­sued draft rules on on­line mi­cro lend­ing, stip­u­lat­ing stricter cap­i­tal re­quire­ments and op­er­a­tional rules for some of Ant Group’s con­sumer credit busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>But the big shocker came on Tues­day night. The Shang­hai Stock Ex­change suspended Ant’s list­ing on its Star board, cit­ing Mon­day’s meet­ing and sub­se­quent reg­u­la­tory changes. Ant then said in a fil­ing it would sus­pend its</p>
    <p>Hong Kong IPO as well.</p>
    <p>The news sparked a slide in Alibaba shares on Tues­day in New York, while drag­ging down other Chi­nese firms’ US-listed stocks.</p>
    <p>What Mr Ma said was a bit sen­sa­tional, per­haps. But he was right. China’s bankers are so averse to ex­tend­ing credit to smaller bor­row­ers that Bei­jing re­de­fined</p>
    <p>“in­clu­sive fi­nanc­ing” to make its banks’ loan books look pret­tier.</p>
    <p>In fact, it has been so dif­fi­cult for small busi­nesses to ob­tain bank credit in the last decade that they have be­come hard­wired not to in­vest for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Here is the lat­est tid­bit of ev­i­dence. In the third quar­ter, even as China’s economy re­cov­ered and 86 per cent of 300 smaller man­u­fac­tur­ers CLSA spoke to be­came prof­itable, most re­mained wary. A record-break­ing 59 per cent of their cap­i­tal ex­penses went into mere “reg­u­lar main­te­nance”, the bro­ker­age found.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma’s words were blunt, but these phrases, such as “pawn shops”, are not his con­coc­tions. Bu­reau­crats at the Peo­ple’s Bank of China, for in­stance, had used the same words them­selves.</p>
    <p>So why is Mr Ma be­ing sin­gled out? Could it be that Ant is too prof­itable and is now be­ing tar­geted?</p>
    <p>Ant is rais­ing at least</p>
    <p>US$37 bil­lion (S$50.4 bil­lion) in an IPO that at­tracted more than</p>
    <p>US$3 tril­lion of re­tail or­ders. Mean­while, re­gional banks are still in the doghouse, strug­gling and some­times be­ing re­struc­tured be­cause they lack cap­i­tal buf­fers.</p>
    <p>In the fast-grow­ing con­sumer credit busi­ness, Ant is es­sen­tially a match­maker while banks lend and put aside cash in case some loans go sour. Fin­tech gi­ants are mak­ing much more than len­ders, city com­mer­cial banks com­plained to lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ant’s vast con­sumer base ap­pre­ci­ates its small loan of­fer­ings. But go­ing for­ward, to ap­pease its banks, Bei­jing may want to level the reg­u­la­tory play­ing field.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Ant may no longer op­er­ate just as a match­maker and might be asked to keep 30 per cent of the loans on its bal­ance sheet, com­pared with only about 2 per cent now. That should have been no prob­lem be­cause Ant’s IPO would have brought in bil­lions of dol­lars of cap­i­tal for loan pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, the Shang­hai ex­change cited the chang­ing reg­u­la­tory land­scape as one rea­son Ant no longer qual­i­fied for a list­ing.</p>
    <p>But in re­al­ity, noth­ing has changed. Since 2017, Bei­jing’s watch­dogs have been de­bat­ing whether to al­low on­line mi­cro len­ders to take a sim­ple loan fa­cil­i­ta­tion model or re­quire them to put away loan pro­vi­sions. This new draft rule is just a con­tin­u­a­tion of the de­bate.</p>
    <p>At the open­ing of his speech, Mr Ma ad­mit­ted he was con­flicted as to whether to at­tend the fo­rum and speak up. Now he prob­a­bly re­grets it.</p>
    <p>But here is the thing: If China is se­ri­ous about fi­nan­cial in­no­va­tion, “in­clu­sive fi­nanc­ing” or the dig­i­tal yuan, let the man who pi­o­neered the busi­ness and made bil­lions along the way share his ex­pe­ri­ences and thoughts.</p>
    <p>If Mr Ma says sys­temic risk is not China’s Achilles heel, hear him out. He knows where the real prob­lem is and could be part of the so­lu­tion.</p>
