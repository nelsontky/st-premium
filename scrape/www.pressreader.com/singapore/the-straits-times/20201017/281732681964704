    <p>A group of re­searchers in Sin­ga­pore will tap their ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) plat­form to eval­u­ate 12 lo­cally avail­able drugs to de­rive a com­bi­na­tion that can be used to treat Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­ac­tive dig­i­tal plat­form, known as IDen­tif.AI, lever­ages AI to calculate the most ef­fec­tive com­bi­na­tion of drugs – along with their re­spec­tive doses – from more than 530,000 pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers are from the In­sti­tute for Dig­i­tal Medicine (WisDM) at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>They found in a study done in April that the op­ti­mal drug com­bi­na­tion com­prised remde­sivir, lopinavir and ri­ton­avir, which are used to treat pa­tients with the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus, or HIV.</p>
    <p>Their find­ings were val­i­dated us­ing live virus in cell cul­ture, and they have been pre-emp­tively cleared for test­ing in a clinical trial in Tai­wan, should the need arise.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dean Ho, di­rec­tor of WisDM, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the “com­bi­na­tion en­abled near-com­plete in­hi­bi­tion of the virus, but remde­sivir isn’t read­ily avail­able, which is a chal­lenge we will ad­dress in fol­low-on stud­ies.”</p>
    <p>So, the re­search team will eval­u­ate in­stead a set of 12 lo­cally ac­ces­si­ble drugs rang­ing from anti-vi­rals to tar­geted ther­a­pies and other agents.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir, which is among the very few au­tho­rised treat­ments for Covid-19, in­hib­ited the virus by 15 per cent, as ini­tially val­i­dated by IDen­tif.AI. So, it is used as a bench­mark for the new set of drug com­bi­na­tions, said Prof Ho.</p>
    <p>A clinical trial by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion on Thurs­day found remde­sivir had lit­tle or no ef­fect on Covid-19 pa­tients’ length of hospital stay or chances of sur­vival, although the re­sults of the trial have not yet been re­viewed.</p>
    <p>Prof Ho said: “In ad­di­tion, remde­sivir has to be ad­min­is­tered in hos­pi­tals through an in­tra­venous in­fu­sion, which could make it chal­leng­ing to de­ploy if there are many Covid-19 pa­tients in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, we are look­ing to in­ves­ti­gate drugs avail­able in tablet form so they can be con­sumed orally.”</p>
    <p>Th­ese drugs would also be eas­ier to dis­pense and can be po­ten­tially ad­min­is­tered at home, he added.</p>
    <p>A study to find out the ef­fec­tive­ness of the new set of drug com­bi­na­tions will be done next month.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers have also been able to lever­age their AI tech­nol­ogy to of­fer per­son­alised treat­ments for cancer pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Us­ing another plat­form known as CU­RATE.AI, drug doses given to pa­tients can be mod­u­lated to pro­duce op­ti­mal re­sults through­out the du­ra­tion of their care.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Raghav Sun­dar, who is from the NUS Depart­ment of Medicine and WisDM, and a con­sul­tant with the Depart­ment of Hae­ma­tol­ogy-On­col­ogy at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity Cancer In­sti­tute, said: “Drug dos­ing in cancer treat­ments is typ­i­cally based on the de­gree of side ef­fects ex­pe­ri­enced by the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“With CU­RATE.AI, each pa­tient’s rec­om­mended dose is cal­i­brated us­ing clinical data gen­er­ated from their in­di­vid­ual re­sponse to treat­ment.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in a pi­lot clinical study done with a United States­based hospital, a pa­tient with ad­vanced prostate cancer was rec­om­mended a 50 per cent re­duc­tion in dose of an in­ves­ti­ga­tional in­hibitor drug for in­creased ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient was able to re­sume an ac­tive life­style as the lower dose was found to be more tol­er­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, a pa­tient in Sin­ga­pore with ad­vanced cancer was given a re­duced dose of nab-pa­cli­taxel – a type of chemo­ther­apy drug – which stopped his cancer from pro­gress­ing and re­duced the size of his lung tu­mour. This al­lowed the pa­tient to con­tinue treat­ment for a longer du­ra­tion with­out suf­fer­ing toxic side ef­fects, com­pared with other pa­tients given the same drug.</p>
    <p>The find­ings have led to a clinical pi­lot trial that is now re­cruit­ing pa­tients.</p>
