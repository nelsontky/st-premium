    <p>For now, it is a dusty red patch of de­graded plan­ta­tion, a short drive west of Se­marang on the north shore of Cen­tral Java.</p>
    <p>But if ev­ery­thing goes to plan, the 4,300ha Batang In­dus­trial Es­tate will be open for busi­ness in the near fu­ture, tap­ping into de­mand from man­u­fac­tur­ers di­ver­si­fy­ing away from China.</p>
    <p>Not that in­dus­trial parks and eco­nomic zones are new to In­done­sia – more than a dozen spe­cial eco­nomic zones dot the coun­try from Batam to Palu, Cen­tral Su­lawesi. But in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal tiffs over land own­er­ship and labour laws can un­der­mine their at­trac­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>And there are plenty of in­dus­trial parks, but they can be pricey – es­pe­cially near big cen­tres like Jakarta.</p>
    <p>The Batang es­tate prom­ises to be dif­fer­ent, said lo­cal district head Wi­haji, who goes by one name.</p>
    <p>The big­gest coal-fired power plant in South-east Asia went into op­er­a­tion nearby last year. An exit off the Trans-Java Toll Road, which skirts the south­ern reaches of the park, is un­der con­struc­tion. A sea ter­mi­nal to re­place the Dutch colo­nial port is in the works.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial min­i­mum wage in Batang is 40 per cent lower than in Jakarta, 365km to the west. And the gov­ern­ment is of­fer­ing hol­i­days of up to a year on leases that will be a third of those at pri­vate es­tates around Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Add to that a prom­ise to wrap up en­vi­ron­men­tal as­sess­ments in two months in­stead of the usual six, and Mr Wi­haji said his lit­tle sea­side district of nearly 770,000 farm­ers and fish­er­men has a lot to of­fer.</p>
    <p>“We have it all,” Mr Wi­haji en­thused in a video call with The Straits Times. “The spirit of the man­age­ment model is to make ev­ery­thing eas­ier for the in­vestor.”</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is one of a se­ries of steps taken since the em­bar­rass­ing rev­e­la­tion by the World Bank last year that of the 33 com­pa­nies the mul­ti­lat­eral body was sur­vey­ing, none had planned to move their base from China to In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Back then, China was mired in a trade stand-off with the United States. It has since had skir­mishes with its neigh­bours and be­come the place where a pan­demic be­gan. For safety, com­pa­nies were opt­ing for</p>
    <p>Viet­nam, Cam­bo­dia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“The World Bank sur­vey was a shock,” said Mr Ikmal Luk­man, deputy chair­man of BKPM. “We know we have to com­pete with other coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>BKPM, or In­done­sian In­vest­ment Co­or­di­nat­ing Board, is the gov­ern­ment agency in charge of in­vest­ment pol­icy and in­dus­try li­ai­son.</p>
    <p>A long-de­layed on­line sys­tem that shaves weeks off the time it takes to se­cure busi­ness li­cences was put into ef­fect in April. BKPM also set up a task force to “iden­tify and at­tract busi­nesses leav­ing China and fa­cil­i­tate their re­lo­ca­tion to In­done­sia”, the agency said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Many for­eign com­pa­nies may have a bad per­cep­tion of us,” said Mr Ikmal. “They think get­ting li­cens­ing is dif­fi­cult. Now we have changed our process.”</p>
    <p>The ef­fort has met with some suc­cess. Dur­ing a visit to Batang in late June, Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo said seven com­pa­nies from Ja­pan, Tai­wan, South Korea and the US had</p>
    <p>IM­PROVED PROCESS</p>
    <p>Many for­eign com­pa­nies may have a bad per­cep­tion of us. They think get­ting li­cens­ing is dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Now we have changed ’’ our process.</p>
    <p>MR IKMAL LUK­MAN, deputy chair­man of BKPM, the In­done­sian In­vest­ment Co­or­di­nat­ing Board.</p>
    <p>com­mit­ted a com­bined US$850 mil­lion (S$1.17 bil­lion) to move at least some of their op­er­a­tions to In­done­sia. It was not im­me­di­ately clear how many will be mov­ing to Batang.</p>
    <p>The re­forms in­clude a sim­pli­fied on­line per­mit­ting process and clearer reg­u­la­tion that is less sus­cep­ti­ble to in­ter­pre­ta­tion. Min­i­mum cap­i­tal re­quire­ments are cod­i­fied in black and white, do­ing away with the back-and-forth with scep­ti­cal bu­reau­crats or wait­ing for mul­ti­ple sig­na­tures, ac­cord­ing to Jakartabas­ed law firm SSEK.</p>
    <p>One of the seven firms plan­ning to move to In­done­sia, Meiloon In­dus­trial, which makes speak­ers and other con­sumer elec­tron­ics, se­cured busi­ness per­mits and started con­struc­tion on its fac­tory in Subang in West Java in six weeks, said Mr Ikmal.</p>
    <p>Sources close to Meiloon said that be­fore ap­proach­ing BKPM, the com­pany had spent two years buy­ing land for its fac­tory. It un­der­scored the chal­lenges for for­eign com­pa­nies – of­ten in low-mar­gin in­dus­tries – to set up op­er­a­tions in South-east Asia’s big­gest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“That’s why we’re pro­vid­ing Batang In­dus­trial Es­tate,” Mr Ikmal said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has pinned its hopes on spurring for­eign in­vest­ment to help cre­ate nine mil­lion jobs each year to soak up the coun­try’s vast pool of un­der­em­ployed labour.</p>
    <p>But re­alised for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment dur­ing the three months to June 30 slipped to US$6.78 bil­lion from just un­der US$7 bil­lion a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to BKPM data.</p>
    <p>Mr A. Lin Neu­mann, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in In­done­sia, said big sys­temic is­sues that can spook in­vestors re­main.</p>
    <p>The sprawl­ing state-owned sec­tor still el­bows aside pri­vate in­vest­ment. The om­nibus Bill that seeks, among other things, to make it eas­ier to fire work­ers, has been stuck in Par­lia­ment for seven months.</p>
    <p>Work­ers with 10 years at an em­ployer are en­ti­tled to nearly two years of salary in sev­er­ance – dou­ble the amount in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“The fixes at BKPM and the in­dus­trial park in Batang are fine,” Mr Neu­mann said. “But we’re look­ing for struc­tural re­form that opens up the econ­omy and cre­ates a level play­ing field.”</p>
