    <p>PETALING JAYA (Se­lan­gor) • The sharp rise i n Covid-19 cases i n Sabah should serve as an “alarm bell” against hold­ing a snap gen­eral elec­tion, warned Malaysia’s top med­i­cal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Emer­i­tus Pro­fes­sor Lam Sai Kit of Univer­siti Malaya said the re­cent Sabah state elec­tion pro­vided a use­ful les­son on what is likely to hap­pen if snap polls are held.</p>
    <p>“There has been spec­u­la­tion that the gov­ern­ment may call for a snap gen­eral elec­tion based on the re­sults of the Sabah polls. I think (this) will be a wrong move. This is not the time to con­sider a coun­try­wide elec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said on Sept 18 that a gen­eral elec­tion could be called ahead of time should his Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) win the state elec­tion.</p>
    <p>GRS, com­pris­ing Perikatan Na­sional, Barisan Na­sional and Parti Ber­satu Sabah, se­cured a ma­jor­ity of 38 out of 73 seats in the polls last Satur­day to form the new state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the polls, Sabah im­posed curbs in four districts on Mon­day, af­ter a surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions. This came af­ter Malaysia on Sun­day re­ported the high­est daily surge in virus cases since Sept 11, the ma­jor­ity of them in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Malaysia re­ported 89 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions, lower than the three-digit num­bers recorded in the past three days, al­though Sabah reg­is­tered the high­est num­ber of 35.</p>
    <p>Prof Lam, who was cen­tral in the dis­cov­ery of the Ni­pah virus, said a snap gen­eral elec­tion would only pro­vide more op­por­tu­ni­ties for Covid-19 to spread widely.</p>
    <p>He said cam­paign­ing dur­ing a gen­eral elec­tion would lead to larger and more fre­quent po­lit­i­cal gath­er­ings, as well as the move­ment of peo­ple through­out the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple would also be urged to re­turn home to their re­spec­tive states to vote and this would mean that there would be no travel ban,” he said, adding that this ex­cluded the move­ment of Elec­tion Com­mis­sion (EC) and se­cu­rity per­son­nel as­sist­ing with the polls.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Subramania­m Mu­niandy echoed sim­i­lar views, say­ing Sabah was a les­son in what could hap­pen if na­tion­wide polls were held.</p>
    <p>“It (Sabah state elec­tion) was al­lowed to pro­ceed and cases of Covid-19 did spike there, with sev­eral clus­ters de­tected. There are also cases in Penin­su­lar Malaysia traced back to Sabah,” Datuk Subramania­m said.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment and EC should con­sult the Health Min­istry on the vi­a­bil­ity of hold­ing snap polls, and the gov­ern­ment should also gather pub­lic feed­back. “Covid-19 cases have been on the rise in the coun­try. We should not put a timeline but fo­cus on flat­ten­ing the curve again for now,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Sazaly Abu Bakar, a vi­rol­o­gist at Univer­siti Malaya, warned of the sig­nif­i­cant health risks. “Un­less the virus is com­pletely elim­i­nated, or an ef­fec­tive treat­ment or vac­cine be­comes avail­able, any mass ac­tiv­ity which in­volves a high de­gree of per­son-to-per­son con­tact, such as a gen­eral elec­tion, poses a sig­nif­i­cant health risk,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Sazaly cited com­pla­cency due to the per­cep­tion that the dis­ease was al­ready well un­der con­trol as a fac­tor for the surge in Covid-19 in­fec­tions, par­tic­u­larly in Sabah.</p>
