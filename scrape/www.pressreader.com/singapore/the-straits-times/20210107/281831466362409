    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia’s tobacco in­dus­try will ob­ject to a pro­posal to ban smok­ing zones in ho­tels and pro­hibit ad­ver­tis­ing at cig­a­rette kiosks as the gov­ern­ment steps up anti-smok­ing ef­forts, two ex­ec­u­tives said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­dia has, over the years, in­tro­duced tobacco con­trols and launched cam­paigns to de­ter its use, but en­force­ment of the law has been a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion says nearly 1.35 mil­lion peo­ple die each year in In­dia due to tobacco use.</p>
    <p>In­dia re­leased draft changes to its tobacco-con­trol law over the week­end to ban smok­ing zones in ho­tels, restau­rants and air­ports. The pro­posal also calls for in­creas­ing the min­i­mum le­gal smok­ing age from 18 to 21.</p>
    <p>If im­ple­mented, the plan is ex­pected to hit sales of com­pa­nies such as ITC, God­frey Phillips In­dia and a unit of Philip Mor­ris In­ter­na­tional which op­er­ate in the coun­try’s US$12 bil­lion (S$15.8 bil­lion) cig­a­rette mar­ket, ex­ec­u­tives said.</p>
    <p>ITC shares fell 3 per cent while God­frey dropped 1.5 per cent yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Some of the mea­sures are very ex­treme and prob­lem­atic,” said one tobacco in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tive, who added that com­pa­nies will raise their con­cerns be­fore the pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion pe­riod of the pro­posal ends on Jan 31.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­ec­u­tive said con­cerns around the im­pact on em­ploy­ment and how farm­ers could be af­fected will also be shared with the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The draft changes have also tight­ened ex­ist­ing pro­vi­sions to ban ad­ver­tis­ing at kiosks and pro­hibit sale of loose cig­a­rette sticks, which form the bulk of the sales, health ac­tivists said.</p>
    <p>“It is a much needed pro­posal as there were some gaps pre­vi­ously. The key is go­ing to be en­force­ment of the law once passed,” said Mr Sanjay Seth, head of tobacco con­trol at the non-profit Sam­bandh Health Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>In­dia had, in 2015, pro­posed sweep­ing changes to its to­bac­co­con­trol law but the pro­posal was dropped fol­low­ing protests from the tobacco in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>A Reuters in­ves­ti­ga­tion in 2017 found that Philip Mor­ris was de­ploy­ing mar­ket­ing tac­tics in In­dia, in­clud­ing cer­tain ad­ver­tis­ing at kiosks, in al­leged vi­o­la­tion of ex­ist­ing laws.</p>
    <p>In­dia later threat­ened the cig­a­rette com­pany with “puni­tive ac­tion” and it re­moved its ads from sev­eral tobacco shops.</p>
