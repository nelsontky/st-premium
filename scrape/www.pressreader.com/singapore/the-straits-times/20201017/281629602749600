    <p>Don’t leave re­train­ing work­ers to the last minute, Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam said yes­ter­day, call­ing on em­ploy­ers to take the lead in equip­ping their staff for fu­ture jobs.</p>
    <p>He said both em­ploy­ers and work­ers must em­brace changes in the job mar­ket so as not to end up in a sit­u­a­tion where in­equal­i­ties widen when some who can­not cope drop out of the work­force.</p>
    <p>“To en­sure a good fit, you don’t wait un­til the last minute,” Mr Thar­man said dur­ing a fire­side chat with OCBC Bank group chief ex­ec­u­tive Sa­muel Tsien, in which they dis­cussed the topic of job match­ing and reskilling work­ers. “You have got to act early, while they still have a job, to start pre­par­ing them.”</p>
    <p>And for work­ers who have lost their jobs, train­ing should be cus­tomised, Mr Thar­man said, adding that this can be made pos­si­ble with a good knowl­edge of the per­son’s back­ground and the new job.</p>
    <p>Ef­fec­tive train­ing would be to cus­tomise it to the in­di­vid­ual, rather than think in generic terms or hope that in­di­vid­u­als can some­how just fit an ex­ist­ing re­quire­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>If peo­ple are suf­fi­ciently pre­pared, they will be able to move fairly swiftly into new roles even if they have lost their jobs, with­out sig­nif­i­cant loss in wages or per­sonal pro­duc­tiv­ity, Mr Thar­man added.</p>
    <p>The fire­side chat was or­gan­ised by the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance (IBF), and took place af­ter Mr Thar­man vis­ited OCBC to learn more about the bank’s ef­forts in up­skilling its staff.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil, which he chairs, an­nounced that IBF, along with the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion and NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute, have been ap­pointed its jobs de­vel­op­ment part­ners.</p>
    <p>Th­ese three or­gan­i­sa­tions have been tasked to work with firms to cre­ate new job and trainee­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties, and help Sin­ga­pore­ans take on th­ese roles.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing yes­ter­day’s di­a­logue, Mr Tsien said OCBC stud­ied the changes over­tak­ing its in­dus­try and iden­ti­fied ar­eas in which it was not fully pre­pared for the fu­ture. “We found out that there were quite a few gaps, par­tic­u­larly in the ar­eas of tech­nol­ogy, data and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the bank in­vested $20 mil­lion in a new struc­tured train­ing pro­gramme for staff to pre­pare them for jobs of the fu­ture, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tsien, who is also vice-chair­man of the IBF coun­cil, added that the or­gan­i­sa­tion will en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to also look at skills when hir­ing, rather than fo­cus­ing only on ex­pe­ri­ence in a par­tic­u­lar role.</p>
    <p>“You can then ex­pand your search into peo­ple who have th­ese skills,” he said. “This will also fa­cil­i­tate peo­ple to move from one role to another role.”</p>
    <p>Both he and Mr Thar­man stressed the im­por­tance of part­ner­ship, es­pe­cially in terms of hav­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices prac­ti­tion­ers serve as ad­junct train­ers.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally makes a dif­fer­ence when you have prac­ti­tion­ers in­volved, com­ple­ment­ing the full­time train­ers,” Mr Thar­man said.</p>
    <p>“That com­bi­na­tion – work­ing pre-emp­tively with firms to cre­ate new jobs and an­tic­i­pate some re­dun­dan­cies, cus­tomis­ing train­ing to the in­di­vid­ual, and bring­ing in prac­ti­tion­ers – will ba­si­cally lead to, I think, a much higher level of qual­ity in the way we are match­ing peo­ple to new needs.”</p>
