    <p>WHO Bri­tish-Chi­nese model Aimee Cheng-Brad­shaw, 25, is a fa­mil­iar face on the lo­cal mod­el­ling scene, grac­ing fash­ion cam­paigns, mag­a­zine cov­ers and run­way shows. The Sin­ga­pore-raised model is best known for rep­re­sent­ing Sin­ga­pore and emerg­ing sec­ond run­ner-up on the third sea­son of Asia’s Next Top Model in 2015.</p>
    <p>My week­ends are su­per fluid and I hardly make solid plans be­cause I can fi­nally re­lax and go with the flow. As a full-time model, my week­days are packed with work.</p>
    <p>I re­cently com­pleted a project with In­sta­gram called #Heart­bits for World Men­tal Health Day in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>I cre­ated a se­ries of videos and an ac­com­pa­ny­ing In­sta­gram Guide on top­ics like so­cial com­par­i­son and strug­gles in the mod­el­ling industry, tak­ing care of my men­tal health through jour­nal­ing and med­i­ta­tion, and ways in which our phys­i­cal health and men­tal health are closely con­nected.</p>
    <p>They are all up on my IGTV (@aimeecheng­brad­shaw). This is a topic near and dear to my heart so I was so happy to have been a part of this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>On Fri­days, I’m usu­ally busy with er­rands, meet­ings or work­out classes that I’ve sched­uled. At night I like to catch up with friends over din­ner and drinks.</p>
    <p>My boyfriend works full-time as well, so week­ends are the only time we get to spend qual­ity time. Gen­er­ally, I start with a morn­ing work­out on Satur­day (ei­ther yoga or F45), fol­lowed by a rel­a­tively lazy day of watch­ing Net­flix and chill­ing at home.</p>
    <p>On Sun­days, we tend to have crav­ings for brunch food. We like to try new cafes and restau­rants so we usu­ally just go for a lit­tle walk around an area and see what we can find. Some places that we love are Free The Ro­bot, Five Oars and The Cof­fee Aca­demics, which we tried for the first time last week­end.</p>
    <p>I ac­tu­ally have a stay­ca­tion planned for this week­end. My boyfriend and I are go­ing for a get­away at Lloyd’s Inn and I’m re­ally ex­cited to go on a mini hol­i­day. It’ll prob­a­bly be a week­end of pool (if there’s sun) and maybe even a hike some­where near the ho­tel, per­haps at Fort Can­ning. Who knows?</p>
    <p>I’ve def­i­nitely been in­dulging in stay­cays these last few months since we can’t travel. Trav­el­ling used to be such a big part of my job so it’s a lit­tle strange to think that I’ve stayed in the same place since March – that hasn’t hap­pened in­years!</p>
