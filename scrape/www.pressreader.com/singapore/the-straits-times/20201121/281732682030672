    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s Prime Min­is­ter yes­ter­day pleaded with mem­bers of the pub­lic to avoid so­cial gath­er­ings and warned that tougher mea­sures may be needed if a new wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion is not quickly con­tained.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun called for all so­cial gath­er­ings planned for the year-end pe­riod to be can­celled, em­ploy­ers to en­cour­age staff to work from home and peo­ple aged 60 and above to stay home. “If we don’t stop this pace of spread now, our daily lives where we could at least catch a breath will again be lim­ited,” he said at a Covid-19 re­sponse meet­ing.</p>
    <p>South Korea tight­ened preven­tion guide­lines on Thurs­day but con­cern is grow­ing that a ban on large pub­lic gath­er­ings does not go far enough, with bars and night­clubs al­lowed to open and re­li­gious ser­vices and sports events al­lowed to re­sume with at­ten­dance curbs.</p>
    <p>A third wave of in­fec­tions was un­der way with 363 new cases con­firmed on Thurs­day, said the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency, the third con­sec­u­tive day the tally has sur­passed 300.</p>
    <p>South Korea has now re­ported a to­tal of 30,017 cases and 501 deaths.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve a third wave of in­fec­tions is now on­go­ing... in the cap­i­tal re­gion,” Health Min­istry of­fi­cial Yoon Tae-ho told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of acutely ill Covid-19 pa­tients was ris­ing sharply and stood at 84 yes­ter­day, strain­ing the re­sources of in­ten­sive care units, the of­fi­cial added.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials said the cap­i­tal re­gion, where about half of the coun­try’s 52 mil­lion peo­ple live and work, may need tougher re­stric­tions if the av­er­age daily com­mu­nity in­fec­tions over a week rose to 200 or more. The cap­i­tal re­gion recorded 218 new cases on Thurs­day, its first daily tally over 200 since Au­gust.</p>
