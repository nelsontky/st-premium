    <p>Al­though it has be­come the world’s most valu­able car­maker, Tesla still has to fig­ure out how to be­come con­sis­tently prof­itable, re­duce qual­ity prob­lems in its lux­ury cars and turn al­lur­ing pro­to­types into mass-pro­duced ve­hi­cles more quickly.</p>
    <p>One area where it has not had much to fret about: com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>In the past year or so, sev­eral car­mak­ers, in­clud­ing Audi, Jaguar and Porsche, have added her­alded new mod­els in­tended to cut into Tesla’s elec­tric dom­i­nance. But they have barely made a dent, at least in the United States.</p>
    <p>Sales of the Jaguar I-Pace, an elec­tric sport util­ity ve­hi­cle (SUV) sim­i­lar to the Tesla Model Y, have to­talled just more than 1,000 units this year. Porsche has re­ported sim­i­lar sales for its elec­tric sedan, the Tay­can.</p>
    <p>Audi, which has grown steadily in the US over the past decade, in­tro­duced an elec­tric SUV, the e-tron, last year and sales have sput­tered. So far this year, Audi has sold just un­der 2,900 units.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, from the num­bers we’re see­ing, these cars aren’t set­ting the world on fire,” said Mr Karl Brauer, an in­de­pen­dent auto an­a­lyst. “It was a mis­take to think that just be­cause these cars were on the mar­ket that peo­ple were go­ing to buy them.”</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Mo­tors has fared some­what bet­ter with its Chevro­let Bolt, which the com­pany in­tro­duced in 2016. It has sold more than 8,000 Bolts this year. Sales of the Nis­san Leaf have topped 3,000 units.</p>
    <p>Tesla, which does not break out sales by coun­try, is op­er­at­ing at a dif­fer­ent level. State data an­a­lysed by Cross-Sell shows that 56,000 new Tes­las have been reg­is­tered this year in 23 states, in­clud­ing Cal­i­for­nia, Florida, New York and Texas.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said Tesla’s 50-state sales to­tal prob­a­bly ex­ceeded 70,000 cars. Glob­ally, the com­pany de­liv­ered about 180,000 cars in the first six months of the year.</p>
    <p>Of course, elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs), in­clud­ing Tesla’s, rep­re­sent a tiny pro­por­tion of auto sales, which to­talled more than 17 mil­lion in the US last year.</p>
    <p>Electrics are a big­ger part of the new-car mar­ket in Europe and Tesla faces more com­pe­ti­tion there than in the US, but not a lot more.</p>
    <p>China has many home-grown elec­tric car­mak­ers, but they tend to make cheaper ve­hi­cles that do not di­rectly com­pete with Tesla’s of­fer­ings. Re­gard­less of the mar­ket, though, EVs are the fastest-grow­ing seg­ment of the auto in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Tesla’s dom­i­nance can be ex­plained in part by its head start.</p>
    <p>It has been sell­ing elec­tric cars in sig­nif­i­cant num­bers since 2012. The com­pany and its chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Elon Musk have also built a fer­vent fan base that few other car­mak­ers, save per­haps high-end sports car brands such as Porsche or Fer­rari, can claim.</p>
    <p>Tesla has long of­fered in­no­va­tions other com­pa­nies are only now try­ing to match, such as wire­less soft­ware up­dates that can add fea­tures or fix glitches with­out trips to deal­er­ships.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest short­com­ings of com­pet­ing mod­els is range – the dis­tance an elec­tric car can go be­fore need­ing to be recharged.</p>
    <p>The max­i­mum for the e-tron and the Tay­can is about 320km. The IPace and Bolt go about 378km to 418km. The least ex­pen­sive Tesla Model 3 has a range of 402km and most of the com­pany’s cars go 482km or more on a sin­gle charge.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam Abuel­samid, an an­a­lyst at Guide­house In­sights, said the Audi, Jaguar and Porsche ve­hi­cles were su­pe­rior to the Tes­las in some ways, such as look, feel and fin­ish, but that their lim­ited range had put off many buy­ers. “The dif­fer­ence is too great for a lot of con­sumers to ig­nore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mercedes-Benz and BMW have been slower to in­tro­duce EVs in the US, where both com­pa­nies plan to start sell­ing new elec­tric SUVs next year. Late last year, Mercedes-Benz de­layed the in­tro­duc­tion of its model, the EQC. And BMW, which in­tro­duced its i3 in 2014, has not built on that early start.</p>
    <p>That has left the field open for Tesla and in­vestors have taken note. The com­pany’s stock has soared this year, climb­ing from US$510 (S$706) in early Jan­uary to about US$1,600.</p>
    <p>The open­ing of a sec­ond assem­bly plant in China and the in­tro­duc­tion of the Model Y have lifted op­ti­mism that Tesla will lead a global tran­si­tion from petrol-pow­ered cars and trucks to zero-emis­sion EVs.</p>
    <p>More­over, a stronger com­pet­i­tive push may come soon.</p>
    <p>By the end of the year, Ford Mo­tor ex­pects to start sell­ing an elec­tric SUV, the Mus­tang Mach-E, that is styled to look like the com­pany’s fa­mous sports car.</p>
    <p>It is promis­ing a ver­sion of the car with a range of 482km or more.</p>
    <p>GM will of­fer a new Bolt with longer range by the end of this year, fol­lowed by more than 20 other elec­tric mod­els over the next three years.</p>
    <p>Volk­swa­gen next year will be­gin sell­ing an elec­tric SUV, the ID4, which will also have a range of 482km. On Mon­day, the com­pany started tak­ing orders in Europe for the ID3, a hatch­back that will sell for about €10,000 (S$16,046) cheaper than the Model 3. The car is not ex­pected to be sold in the US.</p>
    <p>And var­i­ous start-ups are rais­ing bil­lions of dol­lars to chal­lenge Tesla.</p>
    <p>Among the most promis­ing is Ri­vian, which is backed by Ama­zon, Ford and other in­vestors. The Michi­gan-based com­pany plans to bring out next year a pickup truck and an SUV that can go up to 643km.</p>
    <p>Com­ing even sooner is a new com­pany, Polestar, owned by Volvo and Volvo’s Chi­nese par­ent, Zhe­jiang Geely Hold­ing.</p>
    <p>The Polestar 2 hatch­back is sup­posed to go 442km be­fore need­ing a recharge and has the kind of agility – zero to 100kmh in less than five sec­onds – that ap­peals to afi­ciona­dos.</p>
    <p>It will start at US$59,900 in the US and buy­ers will be able to claim a US$7,500 fed­eral tax credit and state in­cen­tives. The com­pany will also sell the Polestar 1, a sports coupe that starts at US$155,000.</p>
    <p>Polestar re­cently opened sales cen­tres in Santa Mon­ica, Cal­i­for­nia, and New York City. Sales are ex­pected to be­gin in the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>Other show­rooms should pop up next year in Bos­ton, Miami, Den­ver and else­where.</p>
