    <p>Lo­cal shares re­bounded yes­ter­day to end a choppy week in the black as in­vestors re­acted pos­i­tively to the coun­try’s non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) fig­ures in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) climbed 0.37 per cent or 9.4 points to close at 2,533.02 with gainers out­pac­ing losers 246 to 177 on trade of 1.07 bil­lion shares worth $1.22 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>In­vestors took heart from news yes­ter­day morn­ing that the coun­try’s non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) rose 5.9 per cent year on year, due mainly to an in­crease in elec­tron­ics ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional was top per­former among the STI con­stituents, gain­ing 2.98 per cent to $4.49.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines climbed 0.57 per cent to $3.51 fol­low­ing Thurs­day’s news of the in-prin­ci­ple agree­ment of the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong travel bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg re­ported yes­ter­day that the cost of air tick­ets between the two cities jumped within 24 hours of the news.</p>
    <p>The cheap­est price for an SIA re­turn econ­omy seat to Hong Kong was $558 yes­ter­day morn­ing un­til the end of December, up from $400 on Thurs­day af­ter­noon when the news was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>How­ever, JPMor­gan an­a­lyst Raisah Rasid noted that “the path of re­cov­ery in the ser­vices-pro­duc­ing sec­tor, par­tic­u­larly in the con­text of the re­sump­tion of in­ter­na­tional travel and re­lated ser­vices, which re­mains highly de­pen­dent on the path of Covid-19, bears watch­ing”.</p>
    <p>In its last day of trad­ing, units of Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust (CCT) gained 0.61 per cent to $1.65.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change said on Thurs­day that CCT will be deleted from the STI in prepa­ra­tion for its merger with Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust, while Kep­pel DC Reit, the largest stock on the STI Re­serve as at Oct 14, is sched­uled to join the STI.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets ended the week mixed. The Hang Seng In­dex gained 0.94 per cent as the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex climbed 0.13 per cent but the Nikkei 225 In­dex fell 0.41 per cent. Aus­tralian shares were in the dol­drums for much of the ses­sion be­fore a marked drop on poor show­ings amid stock in­dex fu­tures on Wall Street. The S&P/ASX 200 clawed ground back to end down 0.5pc but still ahead 1.2pc for the week and 6.2 per cent for the month.</p>
    <p>US in­vestors were await­ing data on re­tail sales and in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion yes­ter­day af­ter the S&P 500 fell overnight, the third straight day of de­cline. Mar­kets in the United States have been rat­tled by the surge in Covid-19 in­fec­tions and fal­ter­ing hopes that a stim­u­lus pack­age might land be­fore the elec­tion.</p>
