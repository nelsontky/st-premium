    <p>HONG KONG • A Hong Kong pro­tester pop­u­larly known as “Grandma Wong” said yes­ter­day that the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties kept her in cus­tody for 11 / months</p>
    <p>2 across the border in Shen­zhen, where she al­legedly suf­fered men­tal abuse, and then pre­vented</p>
    <p>her from com­ing back for more than a year.</p>
    <p>Grey-haired and be­spec­ta­cled Madam Alexan­dra Wong, 64, had been a fa­mil­iar face at anti-govern­ment protests in Hong Kong last year, of­ten wav­ing a large Bri­tish flag, but she dis­ap­peared from the streets around Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists and hu­man rights groups had ex­pressed con­cern over her where­abouts.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia for the first time since her re­lease af­ter com­plet­ing 14 days in quar­an­tine, Madam Wong said she was de­tained by Chi­nese po­lice when she tried to re­turn to her home in Shen­zhen on Aug 14 last year.</p>
    <p>She said that dur­ing about 11/</p>
    <p>2 months’ de­ten­tion at var­i­ous cen­tres, where up to 26 peo­ple would sleep in a room of less than 200 sq ft, she was be­ing in­ter­ro­gated al­most ev­ery day about the Hong Kong protests.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know what crime I com­mit­ted,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Shen­zhen Mu­nic­i­pal Pub­lic Se­cu­rity Bureau could not be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Madam Wong said that af­ter the de­ten­tion, she was sent to the north-western prov­ince of Shaanxi for a five-day pa­tri­otic camp in late Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Un­til early this month, Madam Wong had been re­stricted by the au­thor­i­ties from re­turn­ing to Hong Kong, pend­ing a trial that never took place in the end.</p>
    <p>She stayed in her home in Shen­zhen where she would get reg­u­lar visits by the na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cers, she said.</p>
    <p>“I was scared I would be stopped from com­ing back to Hong Kong... I was scared ev­ery day some­thing might hap­pen again,” she added.</p>
    <p>Madam Wong called for the re­lease of the 12 ac­tivists who were in­ter­cepted at sea in late Au­gust this year by the main­land au­thor­i­ties as they tried to flee by boat to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“I’m wor­ried about the 12 young peo­ple; their treat­ment could be worse than mine.”</p>
