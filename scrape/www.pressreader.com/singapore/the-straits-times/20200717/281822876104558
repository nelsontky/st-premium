    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his daugh­ter and ad­viser Ivanka Trump are ral­ly­ing sup­port for Goya Foods on Twit­ter, as so­cial me­dia pres­sure con­tin­ues for boy­cotting the l argest His­panic-owned US food com­pany over its chief ex­ec­u­tive’s ef­fu­sive praise for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Early on Wed­nes­day, the Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent tweeted, with­out cit­ing ev­i­dence, that “Goya Foods is do­ing great”.</p>
    <p>“The rad­i­cal left smear ma­chine back­fired, peo­ple are buy­ing like crazy!” he added on his per­sonal feed, which has 83.4 mil­lion fol­low­ers, and the of­fi­cial pres­i­den­tial and White House feeds, with more than 50 mil­lion fol­low­ers com­bined.</p>
    <p>That fol­lowed Ms Trump’s late Tues­day post on Twit­ter of the com­pany’s slo­gan, “If it’s Goya, it has to be good”, in both Span­ish and English.</p>
    <p>Ms Trump’s tweet, in which she is seen hold­ing a can of Goya’s black beans, gar­nered over 35,000 retweets and 62,000 likes in a lit­tle over four hours.</p>
    <p>How­ever, her com­ments could vi­o­late gov­ern­ment ethics rules that pro­hibit the use of pub­lic of­fice to en­dorse prod­ucts or ad­vance per­sonal busi­ness gains.</p>
    <p>The US Of­fice of Gov­ern­ment Ethics did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to Reuters’ re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The hash­tags #Goy­away and #Boy­cottGoya trended on Twit­ter af­ter Mr Robert Unanue, CEO of the New Jer­sey-based com­pany, ap­peared with Mr Trump at the White House last week for the cre­ation of an ad­vi­sory panel on spurring His­panic pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>“We’re all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like Pres­i­dent Trump who is a builder, and that’s what my grand­fa­ther did,” said Mr Unanue, the third gen­er­a­tion of his fam­ily to run the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The com­ment alien­ated many Goya con­sumers, who con­sider Mr Trump racist against His­panic peo­ple be­cause of his im­mi­gra­tion poli­cies, his call­ing Mex­i­cans “rapists” dur­ing his 2016 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign, and his re­port­edly call­ing El Sal­vador a “s**thole coun­try” at a 2018 White House meet­ing.</p>
