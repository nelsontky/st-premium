    <p>Dis­rup­tive in­dus­tries in­volv­ing tech­nolo­gies such as au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) re­quire spe­cialised skills that are in short sup­ply in Sin­ga­pore, said op­po­si­tion MP Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One way to nur­ture the growth of such in­dus­tries, with­out re­ly­ing on an un­sus­tain­able im­por­ta­tion of skilled for­eign work­ers, could be to is­sue lim­ited-term for­eign work passes tied to the train­ing of Sin­ga­porean work­ers, he told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Per­era, of the Work­ers’ Party (WP), said in­di­vid­u­als with the nec­es­sary spe­cialised skills could be of­fered, say, a five-year pass.</p>
    <p>In that time, Sin­ga­pore­ans could be trained in the rel­e­vant skills and em­ploy­ers would be ex­pected to hire a Sin­ga­porean to fill the po­si­tion when the lim­ited-term pass ex­pires. If there are not enough Sin­ga­pore­ans by that time, “and this is proven, the pass can be ex­tended a lit­tle longer”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Per­era made the sug­ges­tion dur­ing the de­bate on the min­is­te­rial state­ment Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat made in Par­lia­ment on Oct 5, on Sin­ga­pore’s strat­egy to emerge stronger after Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He also out­lined the chal­lenges posed to the Sin­ga­pore work­force by in­dus­try dis­rup­tions. While Covid-19 may have slowed the ad­vance­ment of some dis­rup­tions, by de­lay­ing new busi­ness in­vest­ments, for in­stance, the dis­rup­tive trends will re­turn as the pan­demic re­cedes.</p>
    <p>He warned that many in­dus­tries that are do­ing fine now will be at risk in a few years. These in­clude de­liv­ery and driv­ing jobs, which will be threat­ened by au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles, as well as cer­tain cler­i­cal or ser­vice jobs, which could be at risk from AI.</p>
    <p>Mr Per­era sug­gested that the Gov­ern­ment look into work­ing with em­ploy­ees and stake­hold­ers in in­dus­tries at risk to get them to an­tic­i­pate the risks and start plan­ning what to do if and when their in­dus­try gets dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Another WP MP, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC), said Sin­ga­pore must have a “Plan B” if the world con­tin­ues on its trend of de-glob­al­i­sa­tion which pre­dates the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Even the typ­i­cally more re­silient work-re­lated mi­gra­tory flows are un­der threat as cor­po­ra­tions re­think their need for busi­ness and con­fer­ence travel and up­end his­tor­i­cal cross-bor­der re­la­tion­ships in favour of reshoring pre­vi­ously out­sourced busi­ness op­er­a­tions and short­en­ing in­ter­na­tional sup­ply chains.”</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore works to re­vive its air hub and trans­ship­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties, it must also pre­pare for the pos­si­bil­ity the changes could be per­ma­nent and the post-Covid-19 world will be more frac­tured and in­su­lar, he said.</p>
    <p>These trends are “wor­ry­ing from the per­spec­tive of our bank­ing on a re­turn to con­nec­tiv­ity as a key source of eco­nomic growth”.</p>
    <p>He said, among other things, that “we must tran­si­tion our econ­omy, ur­gently and de­ci­sively, by in­creas­ing the con­tri­bu­tion of small and medium en­ter­prises to our growth en­gine”.</p>
