    <p>• Had the coron­avirus pan­demic not oc­curred, Nathaniel Phillips would prob­a­bly not be at Liver­pool to­day.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing im­pressed af­ter half a sea­son on loan at VfB Stuttgart last term, the Ger­man club wanted him back as he had helped them se­cure pro­mo­tion to the Bun­desliga.</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­onship sides were just as in­ter­ested in the bruis­ing cen­tre­back and Liver­pool were will­ing to let him go in the sum­mer, de­spite al­ready of­fload­ing De­jan Lovren to Zenit Saint Peters­burg.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the move never ma­te­ri­alised as teams could not af­ford his ask­ing price, with the Covid-19 cri­sis in­flict­ing a fi­nan­cial toll.</p>
    <p>Phillips, 23, was happy to stay even though he felt his chances of play­ing were re­mote – be­fore Satur­day, he had made only one FA Cup ap­pear­ance for Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>But the Reds’ in­jury cri­sis at the back has opened the door for him and he is de­ter­mined to prove he has the qual­ity to play for the Premier League cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>He al­ready has the trust of man­ager Jur­gen Klopp, hardly put­ting a foot wrong as the hosts beat West Ham 2-1 on Satur­day, thanks to Mo­hamed Salah’s penalty and sub­sti­tute Diogo Jota’s late strike.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors took a shock firsthalf lead through Pablo For­nals, but that was down to a howler by Joe Gomez, Phillips’ more ex­pe­ri­enced de­fen­sive part­ner.</p>
    <p>Af­ter im­press­ing against David Moyes’ men, Klopp has no qualms about field­ing him again in the ab­sence of Fabinho, Joel Matip and Vir­gil van Dijk.</p>
    <p>On Phillips, who is into his third sea­son at An­field, the Ger­man told the BBC: “He’s a bril­liant guy, a smart guy, in­tel­li­gent.</p>
    <p>“In the air, he’s a mon­ster and he loves hav­ing chal­lenges on the pitch. He was in­cred­i­ble for his first game. I’m pretty sure ev­ery­body can imag­ine how nervy that can be af­ter a long wait.</p>
    <p>“It’s a crazy story. Three years ago, he was on his way to Amer­ica to go to col­lege. Then he came to our se­cond team, then he trained with us and im­pressed us.</p>
    <p>“In the sum­mer, 12 Cham­pi­onship teams wanted him. It was clear he would go and I was fine with it at that mo­ment but it didn’t work out. Good for us.”</p>
    <p>Klopp also re­served praise for match win­ner Jota af­ter the for­ward, who ar­rived on a £41 mil­lion (S$72.6 mil­lion) trans­fer from Wolves dur­ing the sum­mer, scored for the third straight game.</p>
    <p>“Diogo is in a good mo­ment – and we’re re­ally happy that we could make that sign­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Phillips was omit­ted from Liver­pool’s Cham­pi­ons League squad, such was the ex­pec­ta­tion that he would be mov­ing on in the sum­mer, so he is not el­i­gi­ble to play in their Group D game at Italy’s Ata­lanta to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with van Dijk a longterm ab­sen­tee, Fabinho not set to re­turn un­til af­ter the up­com­ing in­ter­na­tional break and Matip ques­tion­able, the English­man could be in line for Sun­day’s league clash at Manch­ester City.</p>
    <p>But Phillips is not over­awed, say­ing: “It’s im­por­tant I’m play­ing first-team foot­ball... I need to be push­ing on.”</p>
