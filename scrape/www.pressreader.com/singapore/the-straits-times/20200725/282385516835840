    <p>MIN­NESOTA (Min­neapo­lis) • Chi­nese golfer Zhang Xin­jun is not used to be­ing near the top on the PGA Tour, but he is soar­ing high af­ter rolling in a 31-foot ea­gle putt on his third hole of the day on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old started with a six-un­der 65 at the 3M Open to share third place with Tony Finau and four oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The po­si­tion is Zhang’s best on Tour since he held the first-round lead with Dou Zecheng at the 2018 Zurich Clas­sic of New Or­leans, where the pair were 12-un­der 60 in the four-ball for­mat.</p>
    <p>“Just re­ally was able to get it go­ing from there,” he said of his ea­gle at the par-five 12th. “Re­ally the hole right af­ter that, I al­most hit it in the hole, and on No. 4 too, al­most hit it in there as well. So just hit the ball re­ally good and putted re­ally well too.”</p>
    <p>Pre­ci­sion was on dis­play through­out the morn­ing for the Chi­nese, who also hit his 154-yard ap­proach shot at the par-four 14th in­side a foot. He carded two more birdies be­fore mak­ing the turn, in­clud­ing a 17-footer at the par-three 17th, then added a cou­ple more on the parthree fourth and par-five fifth, the first of which was a near ace.</p>
    <p>He carded just one bo­gey at the par-four sec­ond, where he hit the green in three and two-putted.</p>
    <p>“I hit most of my tee shots re­ally well,” he added. “Iron play was strong as well. And putted re­ally well to­day, too. It was a good, well­rounded game to­day.”</p>
    <p>Richy Werenski, in search of his first PGA Tour vic­tory, birdied the fi­nal hole to card a 63 at TPC Twin Cities to sit one shot clear of Michael Thomp­son.</p>
    <p>Zhang is pro­jected to rise 15 spots to No. 49 in the FedEx Cup stand­ings and is close to se­cur­ing a spot in the first two play­off events.</p>
    <p>But, more im­por­tantly, he is in po­si­tion for his big­gest payday yet. He has fin­ished in­side the top-five just twice in 52 ca­reer starts, in­clud­ing this sea­son when he fin­ished tied for fourth at the Hous­ton Open.</p>
    <p>He was not the only Asian who made a splash. South Korean Bae Sang-moon made head­lines for “one of the great­est par saves in the his­tory of golf”, ac­cord­ing to pgatour.com.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old, who carded a four-over 75, re­mark­ably made a par on the 18th hole af­ter his first two tee shots went way­ward. His first shot found the wa­ter so he took a drop. His sec­ond swing, and third shot, also landed in the wa­ter so he took an­other drop. Then he drained a shot from 250 yards.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Tour, Bae has the long­est hole-out for par in the ShotLink era, ahead of the 176 yards recorded by Steven Bowditch at the fourth hole of the RBC Her­itage Open’s first round in 2011.</p>
