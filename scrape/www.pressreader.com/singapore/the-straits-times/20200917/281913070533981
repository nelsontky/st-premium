    <p>•</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR A Malaysian man who lost his mo­bile phone later found a se­ries of self­ies and a video left on the phone ap­par­ently by an un­usual thief: a macaque.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence in a Twit­ter post, Mr Zack­rydz Rodzi, 20, said he had just wo­ken up from a nap at his house l ast Satur­day when he re­alised his phone was miss­ing. He searched ev­ery­where in the house but all that he could find was the phone case un­der the bed.</p>
    <p>“If it was stolen by a thief, why would the thief leave the cas­ing and take off with the phone?” he wrote in his Twit­ter thread.</p>
    <p>He told the BBC later that he de­cided to call his phone again after his fa­ther had no­ticed a mon­key out­side their house on Sun­day, and that was when he heard it ring­ing from the jun­gle a few steps be­yond the back gar­den.</p>
    <p>The mud­died phone was found be­neath a palm tree.</p>
    <p>“I checked my phone’s gallery and found out my phone was ‘stolen’ by a mon­key,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>In a video that has been retweeted more than 5,000 times, the mon­key ap­peared to be star­ing down on the cam­era against the back­drop of green leaves. In some pho­tos, it was seen to be try­ing to eat the phone.</p>
    <p>Mr Zack­rydz, who ac­cord­ing to the BBC is a fi­nal-year com­puter science stu­dent from Batu Pa­hat in</p>
    <p>In a video that has been retweeted more than 5,000 times, the mon­key ap­peared to be star­ing down on the cam­era against the back­drop of green leaves. In some pho­tos, it was seen to be try­ing to eat the phone.</p>
    <p>the south­ern state of Jo­hor, said he sus­pected the mon­key had en­tered the house from an open win­dow in his brother’s bed­room.</p>
    <p>“This is not some­thing that you see ev­ery cen­tury,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know since when the mon­key has been liv­ing in my neigh­bour­hood but... mon­key, you’ve made my life mis­er­able for two days.”</p>
    <p>Mr Zack­rydz is ap­par­ently not the only vic­tim the mon­key had bur­gled from. Lo­cal me­dia re­ported that the simian had pre­vi­ously stolen two other mo­bile phones in the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
