    <p>Aus­tralia’s Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son spent part of last week in Covid-19 quar­an­tine in Can­berra af­ter re­turn­ing from a trip to Ja­pan, but his en­forced iso­la­tion did not mean that he in­tended to stay silent.</p>
    <p>In­stead, on Nov 30, he called a vir­tual press con­fer­ence af­ter learn­ing about a tweet posted by Mr Zhao Li­jian, a Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman who has be­come known for his de­lib­er­ately provoca­tive tweets.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao had posted a tweet that fea­tured a pho­to­shopped im­age of an Aus­tralian sol­dier hold­ing a blood­ied knife to the throat of an Afghan child – a ref­er­ence to a re­cent Aus­tralian war crimes in­quiry, which found that troops had mur­dered Afghan civil­ians.</p>
    <p>Just hours af­ter the tweet ap­peared, Mr Mor­ri­son spoke via video link from his Can­berra res­i­dence, declar­ing that the tweet was “re­pug­nant” and de­mand­ing that Bei­jing apol­o­gise.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed the tweet as “ap­palling” and “out­ra­geous” – a view widely en­dorsed by politi­cians of all per­sua­sions in Aus­tralia, as well as by other for­eign govern­ments.</p>
    <p>This spat is more than a dis­pute over a crass post on so­cial me­dia – it is also a re­veal­ing in­di­ca­tor of the wors­en­ing ties be­tween Aus­tralia and its largest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>In­deed, just days be­fore the tweet, China had an­nounced tar­iffs on Aus­tralian wines of up to 212 per cent amid claims of wine dump­ing. But it was widely seen as yet an­other puni­tive move by China.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia sells more wine to China than any other coun­try, ac­count­ing for about 35 per cent of Chi­nese wine im­ports. Many grow­ers will find it al­most im­pos­si­ble to sell to China, par­tic­u­larly as the tar­iffs were not ap­plied to com­peti­tors such as France and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>RE­LA­TION­SHIP BREAK­DOWN</p>
    <p>The prospect of any im­me­di­ate res­o­lu­tion to the stand-off seems low.</p>
    <p>The start of the ten­sions is of­ten cred­ited to then Prime Min­is­ter Mal­colm Turnbull’s de­ci­sion in late 2017 to in­tro­duce for­eign in­flu­ence leg­is­la­tion. The laws fol­lowed Aus­tralian in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials’ warn­ing of at­tempts by Bei­jing to in­ter­fere with ac­tiv­i­ties in Par­lia­ment and at univer­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Other ac­tions by Aus­tralia also an­gered China. The fed­eral gov­ern­ment blocked a se­ries of Chi­nese for­eign in­vest­ment bids in gas, en­ergy and agri­cul­tural as­sets, cit­ing con­cerns about na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Ties have wors­ened in the past year. In April, Aus­tralia called for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of the Covid-19 pan­demic – a move ini­tially pre­sented as an at­tempt to blame China. Aus­tralia has also de­nounced China’s mass de­ten­tion of Uighurs and crit­i­cised its de­ci­sion to im­pose se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>In an un­usual move, China’s em­bassy in Aus­tralia last month pre­sented an Aus­tralian jour­nal­ist from Nine Me­dia with a doc­u­ment out­lin­ing all of Bei­jing’s griev­ances.</p>
    <p>The list of 14 items in­cluded Aus­tralia’s “wan­ton in­ter­fer­ence” into af­fairs in Tai­wan, Hong Kong and Xin­jiang and its block­ing of 10 for­eign in­vest­ment deals.</p>
    <p>A LARGER BAT­TLE</p>
    <p>In the broader pic­ture, the main prob­lem is that Aus­tralia is a staunch ally of the US at a time when the Wash­ing­ton-Bei­jing ri­valry is in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>China is now the world’s sec­ond largest econ­omy and the sec­ond high­est mil­i­tary spender. It trails the US, but is quickly catch­ing up. It now has the world’s largest navy, which marks a se­ri­ous chal­lenge to the mil­i­tary supremacy that the US has en­joyed in the re­gion for decades. And its globe-span­ning Belt and Road Initiative in­fra­struc­ture pro­gramme as well as its sta­tus as the world’s largest trad­ing na­tion have in­creased its com­mer­cial ties with coun­tries around the world.</p>
    <p>In the US, there is a grow­ing con­sen­sus in Wash­ing­ton about the need to counter China’s mil­i­tary as­sertive­ness and com­mer­cial clout.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, for in­stance, sig­nalled last week he was not plan­ning to quickly end Mr Don­ald Trump’s trade war with China or re­move the tar­iffs Mr Trump has im­posed on its goods. “I’m not go­ing to make any im­me­di­ate moves, and the same ap­plies to the tar­iffs,” he told The New York Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son, who com­pleted his quar­an­tine on Dec 3, has tried to dis­tance Aus­tralia from the more stri­dent ap­proach of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, which has de­clared it sees China as a strate­gic ri­val.</p>
    <p>But Can­berra is con­cerned about the grow­ing ten­sions in the re­gion and the pos­si­bil­ity of con­flict – and so it has been shoring up ties with its main se­cu­rity part­ner.</p>
    <p>Amid the furore over the Twit­ter post last week, for in­stance, Aus­tralia’s De­fence Min­is­ter Linda Reynolds re­leased a state­ment an­nounc­ing that Aus­tralia and the US had signed a new deal to co­op­er­ate on de­vel­op­ing and test­ing hyper­sonic cruise mis­siles.</p>
    <p>The project was seen as an at­tempt by the two al­lies to counter tech­nol­ogy be­ing de­vel­oped by China and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton, too, has sent sig­nals that it will stand by Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>US State De­part­ment deputy spokesman Cale Brown said of the Chi­nese tweet: “We stand with our Aus­tralian part­ners… This is a new low, even for the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.”</p>
    <p>CHINA PUN­ISHES AUS­TRALIA</p>
    <p>But China has not been con­tent to merely voice its anger at per­ceived slights from Can­berra. It ap­pears to have ac­tively pun­ished Aus­tralia. As ten­sions wors­ened over the past year, China im­posed a range of trade re­stric­tions on Aus­tralian goods that threat­ened an es­ti­mated A$20 bil­lion (S$19.8 bil­lion) worth of ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also is­sued travel warn­ings to Chi­nese tourists and stu­dents, claim­ing they should be cau­tious about the risk of racial dis­crim­i­na­tion. China is Aus­tralia’s largest source of for­eign vis­i­tors and stu­dents, who pump bil­lions of dol­lars into the econ­omy each year.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially, China says th­ese mea­sures are rolled out due to con­cerns about health or ad­min­is­tra­tive prob­lems or trad­ing prac­tices. But China’s con­duct has largely been seen as re­tal­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Trade Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said: “The cu­mu­la­tive im­pact of China’s trade sanc­tions against a num­ber of Aus­tralian in­dus­tries dur­ing the course of this year does give rise to the per­cep­tion th­ese ac­tions are be­ing un­der­taken as a re­sult or in re­sponse to some other fac­tors.”</p>
    <p>China has also im­posed an ef­fec­tive freeze on min­is­te­rial con­tacts. Mr Mor­ri­son is set to be­come Aus­tralia’s first prime min­is­ter not to visit China since diplo­matic ties be­tween the two coun­tries were es­tab­lished in 1972.</p>
    <p>De­spite deny­ing that it is ac­tively pu­n­ish­ing Aus­tralia, China has point­edly ac­cused Aus­tralia of dis­re­spect­ing and un­der­min­ing it.</p>
    <p>Asked about the on­go­ing spat, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said at a brief­ing that some coun­tries have been treat­ing China with a “I can, but you can­not” mind­set.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, in terms of tech­nol­ogy, I can have weapons, but you can­not,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In terms of pub­lic opinion, I can openly at­tack you, openly sup­port Ti­betan in­de­pen­dence, sup­port Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence, openly sup­port sep­a­ratist forces in Xin­jiang, openly sup­port the Hong Kong op­po­si­tion par­ties and vi­o­lent law­break­ers, but you can­not. This ‘I can, but you can­not’ men­tal­ity ac­tu­ally re­flects the in­ex­pli­ca­ble and un­rea­son­able ar­ro­gance and hypocrisy of some peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>HINTS AT REC­ON­CIL­I­A­TION</p>
    <p>De­spite this grow­ing fric­tion, both sides have at times made con­cil­ia­tory re­marks. Mr Mor­ri­son, for in­stance, fol­lowed his con­dem­na­tion of Mr Zhao’s tweet by call­ing for di­a­logue and a “reset” with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>China’s Deputy Am­bas­sador to Aus­tralia Wang Xin­ing last Fri­day said: “We still hope to see con­crete ac­tions done by the Aus­tralian side to pro­mote a favourable at­mos­phere for stronger col­lab­o­ra­tion and to bring our re­la­tion­ship back to nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>But the broader prob­lem re­mains: As ten­sions in the re­gion in­crease, Aus­tralia and China are find­ing them­selves on op­pos­ing sides.</p>
    <p>This is strain­ing their re­la­tion­ship in ways that would re­quire care­ful diplo­macy, mea­sured pub­lic com­ments and di­rect di­a­logue – and there is lit­tle ev­i­dence that any of this is oc­cur­ring.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Mr Zhao’s tweet, Mr Mor­ri­son not only de­manded an apol­ogy from the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry but also asked for it to be re­moved. Not sur­pris­ingly, no apol­ogy has been forth­com­ing. And it re­mains at the top of Mr Zhao’s Twit­ter feed.</p>
