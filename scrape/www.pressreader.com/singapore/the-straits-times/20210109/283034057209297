    <p>•</p>
    <p>The stolen cars reap­peared on the streets of Hart­ford, Con­necti­cut, so of­ten over the past year that po­lice would some­times find five in a day.</p>
    <p>But un­like the hot-wiring hey­days of the 1980s and 1990s, when chop shops thrived, most of the re­cov­ered cars were un­harmed.</p>
    <p>Af­ter years of de­clines, car thefts ap­pear to be surg­ing in cities and sub­urbs all over the coun­try. The spree, which has been ex­ac­er­bated by the pan­demic, does not ap­pear to be the work of so­phis­ti­cated crime rings, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>In­stead, this new wave of car thefts seems to stem from a com­bi­na­tion of sim­ple care­less­ness and the same tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ment that once made steal­ing cars nearly im­pos­si­ble: the key fob.</p>
    <p>The broad adop­tion of key­less ig­ni­tions that be­gan in the late 1990s ush­ered in a dark era for car thieves. New cars had en­gine im­mo­bilis­ers that only a mi­crochip in the key fob could un­lock, and ve­hi­cle thefts quickly plum­meted. From a high of 1.7 mil­lion a year in 1991, thefts had dropped over 50 per cent in re­cent years, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by the FBI.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy, it seemed, had largely solved the prob­lem of stolen ve­hi­cles. Un­til peo­ple started leav­ing their fobs sit­ting in their cup hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Now, po­lice said for­got­ten fobs and key­less tech­nol­ogy have con­trib­uted to soar­ing stolen car cases that do not look much like the crimes that plagued cities three decades ago.</p>
    <p>In Hart­ford, po­lice have traced the surge to teens joyrid­ing in from the sub­urbs. In Los An­ge­les, stolen cars reap­pear so fre­quently that po­lice be­lieve thieves are us­ing them like Ubers.</p>
    <p>And in New York City, a re­lated but dif­fer­ent prob­lem has emerged as more driv­ers leave their cars run­ning to make pit stops and de­liv­er­ies dur­ing the pan­demic, mak­ing their cars easy tar­gets for thieves who can sim­ply drive away, even with­out a fob.</p>
    <p>The is­sue so con­cerned the New York City Po­lice Depart­ment that it re­cently made a video fea­tur­ing a man whose car was stolen – with his French bull­dog in­side – to warn New York­ers of the risk.</p>
    <p>“This is a very stupid prob­lem to have,” a Hart­ford Po­lice Depart­ment of­fi­cial said to re­porters last month, on a day when five stolen cars were re­cov­ered in the city and 12 peo­ple – about half of whom are teenagers – were ar­rested.</p>
    <p>“The tech­nol­ogy that was cre­ated specif­i­cally to elim­i­nate car thefts, such as key fob tech­nol­ogy, is now be­ing used against us.”</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion has left law en­force­ment strug­gling to keep up with a del­uge of car thefts. In some places, the end­less caseload has threat­ened to over­bur­den smaller po­lice de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>But un­like the crimes of yes­ter­year, when stolen cars would even­tu­ally turn up stripped for parts, po­lice said most to­day are aban­doned un­dam­aged. And with la­bo­ri­ous trac­ing work, po­lice said they are able to re­turn many stolen cars to their own­ers.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has made the prob­lem worse, said deputy in­spec­tor Jes­sica Corey of the New York City Po­lice Depart­ment’s Crime Pre­ven­tion Di­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>With the in­crease in de­liv­er­ies as peo­ple try to stay home, many vic­tims are de­liv­ery driv­ers mak­ing drop-offs, she said, stress­ing that in many of the city’s cases, peo­ple have also left cars run­ning with tra­di­tional keys.</p>
    <p>In New York City, 6,858 ve­hi­cles were stolen last year, up from 3,988 the year be­fore. Of those taken last year, more than 3,450 were stolen while they were run­ning. The year be­fore, 1,634 were stolen while run­ning. (The depart­ment does not spec­ify whether elec­tronic or tra­di­tional keys are used.)</p>
    <p>A snap­shot of a sin­gle New York City day is re­veal­ing: On Dec 5 alone, 11 ve­hi­cles were stolen while left run­ning, and an­other six were taken with keys or fobs in­side, ac­cord­ing to the po­lice depart­ment.</p>
    <p>There are many ways to leave a car vul­ner­a­ble: Some driv­ers for­get a key fob in­side. Oth­ers take it, but leave the car on, al­low­ing the ve­hi­cle to be driven away, though not restarted later. Some cars can be started if the key is just nearby.</p>
    <p>And in a smaller num­ber of cases, crim­i­nals have used tech­nol­ogy to re­pro­gram key­less cars.</p>

He re&#xAD;cently left his car run&#xAD;ning out&#xAD;side a pet store and re&#xAD;turned to find it had been stolen with his dog in&#xAD;side be&#xAD;cause he had left a spare key fob in the car.</p>
