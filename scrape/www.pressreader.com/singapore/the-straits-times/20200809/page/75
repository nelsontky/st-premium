        Insight | | B7 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 SPECIAL HONOUR Traditiona­lly, I’ve always spent National Day at home with my family where we watch the parade live together, but this year, I’m honoured to be representi­ng

On her NCID work, she says that patients would sometimes arrive in a worried or jittery state, and she would step in to reassure them.
“Many of the foreign workers are often extremely worried about the communicat­ion barriers. I remembered one was very anxious because he was so worried that he might have contracted the virus and wanted to contact his family,” she adds.
“In times like these, it’s important to calm them down and let them have their moment, because it brings them a great deal of comfort and it can really make a difference.” tansuwen@sph.com.sg Ferrying healthcare staff to and from work Creating an isolation facility in four days tips from passengers during this period, despite the general economic hardship.
Grab says the proportion of passengers who tipped tripled between March and April, a trend that has continued into phase two of Singapore’s reopening. The average tipping amount has also increased by 5 per cent to 10 per cent.
Mr Lee is driving today, as he anticipate­s higher demand for rides on a public holiday, but says it will not detract from the importance of the day for him. “(The National Day Parade) definitely helps to strengthen our Singaporea­n pride. It reminds us of the reason why we need to stay united to overcome this crisis.”
He hopes things can return to the way they were before Covid-19, but notes that the crisis has altered people’s behaviour for the better.
“Singaporea­ns are much more appreciati­ve of the little things now. I know friends who do food deliveries who receive food and drinks from customers. I hope this appreciati­on for our job continues, even as we go back to normal.” the technology from scratch at the Expo and teach patients how to use the gadgets. “There was some concern and fear that I would be infected. But we took all necessary precaution­s and used a lot of hand sanitiser,” she says.
Her 23-year-old daughter is a nurse at Sengkang General Hospital and both will be at their posts today. Ms Ho has two other daughters, 21 and 25, who will watch the celebratio­ns from home in Yishun.
Ms Ho previously worked in the education sector and moved to healthcare four years ago to “contribute in a different way”. She is proud of how Singapore’s healthcare workers have performed in the pandemic. She will take a short break from work today to receive the salute from the mobile column to essential workers at the Expo.
More than 50 IHiS employees are working on National Day.
“It is due recognitio­n for us,” Ms Ho says of the salute. “(It) makes me feel like they mean it when they say they appreciate our sacrifice and the risk we are taking.” General Hospital to Woodlands.
“When we reached her destinatio­n, her husband came down and gave me a can of orange juice,” he recalls. “They thanked me using sign language, and the nurse also lipped ‘Have a safe drive!’.
“These acts of kindness are not necessary, but (these people) took the extra effort to make me feel appreciate­d, and made my day.”
On going into this area of driving, Mr Lee says: “Covid-19 impacted my earnings as my income started falling even before the circuit breaker started. As most people stayed home, driving people alone was no longer sustainabl­e.”
His decision has put him close to the front line of Singapore’s Covid-19 efforts, but he says he is not worried, as the nurses and doctors he drives “are profession­als and know how to best keep themselves and the people around them safe”.
As he lives with his elderly parents, aged 61 and 64, Mr Lee makes sure to practise contactles­s pickup and delivery for food and parcels. He also takes his temperatur­e and regularly sanitises his hands.
He says he has received more days to institute a new model of care,” she says of the facility, which has ended up housing nearly a thousand patients at a time.
Ms Ho and her Expo team of about 30 people set up kiosks monitoring patients’ vital signs and developed software so they would have patients’ details from the hospitals before they arrived. They also created multi-language software for patients and conducted training for clinical teams from different hospitals to standardis­e procedures.
They pulled it off – but after that, she and the team often worked 14to 16-hour days over a month to refine the set-up. Ms Ho says: “For a whole month we huddled together at night once every two to three days to tweak the system so that we could stabilise and improve the care we were giving to patients.”
IHiS is the technology vendor for Singapore’s healthcare sector. It was able to deploy technology such as remote-controlled robots to minimise unnecessar­y contact between the 15 nurses and eight doctors per shift and the 800 to 900 patients in the Expo halls. But this meant Ms Ho’s team had to set up Healthcare director Jessie Ho, 54, had just four days’ notice to create a community isolation facility at the Singapore Expo. The number of Covid-19 cases had hit 1,000 in Singapore on April 1 and cases in migrant worker dorms were rising.
To manage the surge in demand for hospital spaces, the Government decided to convert the Expo into a space for those needing less medical attention.
The fast pace of events piled the pressure on Ms Ho – director of the healthcare enablement office of Integrated Health Informatio­n Systems (IHiS) – and her team to get things under way before patients started streaming in. “We had four Clement Yong Mr Aloysius Lee used to only transport passengers for Grab, but with more people staying at home because of the coronaviru­s, he joined the firm’s food and parcel delivery services in April.
The 33-year-old is also a driver for GrabCare, a service dedicated to ferrying healthcare profession­als to and from hospitals.
Congenital­ly deaf, Mr Lee communicat­es with passengers by typing on a screen or through simple gestures. This has led to heart-warming moments, such as when he ferried a nurse from near Singapore Clement Yong clementy@sph.com.sg in 2010, and finds out how their stories have evolved and how they have reinvented themselves amid the pandemic. Barber aims to give old shop a cutting edge where, says Mr Syuhadak.
“We want it to be affordable because we are in a heartland residentia­l area,” says Ms Noorhalian­a.
This has helped bring in the customers again, after the dip earlier this year.
They also plan to revamp the shop this year and give it a new name. “Currently, it means a small bird, so as we have evolved we are thinking it’s time to change. My wife suggested the albatross, so we might use that,” says Mr Syuhadak.
The couple plan to redo the decor of the shop, while retaining the fusion feel, and are looking to expand to another two or three shops. They had originally planned to do so this year before the pandemic hit.
In the future, Mr Syuhadak hopes one of their children will take over the shop: “I want to pass it to someone who will take care of clients and the reputation of the shop – that barbers here are friendly and kind.” As a teenager following around his grandfathe­r – the man who started the Sri Dewana barber shop chain – Mr Muhamad Syuhadak knew this was his calling, too.
“I loved the feeling in the shop, talking to the barbers and customers. It was like a home away from home,” says Mr Syuhadak, 38.
After learning the ropes from his grandfathe­r, he managed to find his own space to set up shop in Marine Terrace, where he grew up.
When The Sunday Times interviewe­d Mr Syuhadak in 2010 for a National Day special, the barber had only just started his business, Nuri Cahaya – which implies in Malay a small bird flying towards the light – for a few years. Ten years later, he has taken his shop to new heights, and given it his own spin.
While the seats for the customers are still the old model and he continues to do cuts with scissors – the old-school style, he says – the shop now has wireless clippers, offers trendy gentleman’s haircuts and has edgy pomades and hairwax on sale.
The fusion of the old and the new keeps regulars coming back, while attracting new customers – forming a clientele of all ages and races.
Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, business struggled for a bit, in particular when hairdresse­rs and barber shops were ordered to close for several weeks during the circuit breaker period, says Mr Syuhadak, who got divorced in 2017.
But he and his new wife Siti Noorhalian­a, 39, and their three teenagers from his wife’s previous marriage, managed to tide themselves over thanks to the Covid-19 Support Grant, for which Ms Noorhalian­a, who works in retail, was eligible. Ms Noorhalian­a recently came on board as co-owner of the shop, to help manage finances and run the shop, while Mr Syuhadak plans to take a back seat and focus on haircuts.
The couple have big plans for the shop’s future. They constantly keep up with haircut trends, and have re- cently begun offering “zero fades” – cutting the sides down to minimal length – and other now-trendy gentleman’s haircuts at $17 for an adult, compared with $25 to $45 else- Goh Yan Han PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
