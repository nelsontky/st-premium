    <p>BRUS­SELS/LON­DON • Bri­tish and Eu­ro­pean Union ne­go­tia­tors made a last-ditch ef­fort yes­ter­day to bridge stub­born dif­fer­ences stand­ing in the way of a post-Brexit trade deal, but they had at best 48 hours left to avoid a dis­or­derly part­ing of ways at the end of this month.</p>
    <p>“EU-UK ne­go­ti­a­tions have en­tered the endgame, time is run­ning out quickly,” said an EU diplo­mat af­ter the bloc’s chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier gave mem­ber states’ en­voys to Brus­sels a down­beat as­sess­ment of the state of play.</p>
    <p>“It is for the UK to chose be­tween... a pos­i­tive out­come or a no-deal out­come.”</p>
    <p>With grow­ing fears of “no-deal” chaos af­ter Lon­don fi­nally leaves the EU’s or­bit on Dec 31, talks re­sumed be­fore Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Eu­ro­pean Com­mis­sion Pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen were set to re­view the sit­u­a­tion in a call last night.</p>
    <p>Ir­ish Prime Min­is­ter Micheal Martin, whose coun­try would be the hard­est-hit of the 27 EU states if there is no trade ac­cord, put the chances of a deal at 50-50.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment bank JPMor­gan said its odds on a no-deal had risen to one-third from 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish pound ster­ling tum­bled on con­cerns that there would be no agree­ment cov­er­ing an­nual trade worth nearly US$1 tril­lion (S$1.34 tril­lion).</p>
    <p>Mr Barnier told mem­bers of the Eu­ro­pean Par­lia­ment in a sep­a­rate brief­ing that ne­go­ti­a­tions could go on un­til to­mor­row, but no fur­ther, Ire­land’s RTE news re­ported.</p>
    <p>EU diplo­mats said the ball was now in Mr John­son’s court.</p>
    <p>Ire­land’s com­mis­sioner in the EU executive Mairead McGuin­ness said: “Peo­ple need to un­der­stand that the Bri­tish are play­ing with fire here and the fire can burn ev­ery­body and that’s some­thing we should all try to avoid.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Sun news­pa­per re­ported that Mr John­son, a fig­ure­head for Bri­tain’s cam­paign that led to a Vote Leave vic­tory in a 2016 ref­er­en­dum, was ready to pull out of the talks within hours un­less Brus­sels changed its de­mands.</p>
    <p>In Lon­don, a law­maker in Mr John­son’s gov­ern­ing Con­ser­va­tive Party said France would have to make con­ces­sions on fish­ing, and the EU would have to drop what he said were new de­mands on fair com­pe­ti­tion known as the level play­ing field.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, which joined the EU in 1973, for­mally left the bloc on Jan 31 but has been in a tran­si­tion pe­riod since then un­der which rules on trade, travel and business re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>For weeks, the two sides have been hag­gling over fish­ing rights in Bri­tish wa­ters, en­sur­ing fair com­pe­ti­tion for com­pa­nies and ways to solve fu­ture dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure to se­cure a deal would clog bor­ders, up­set fi­nan­cial mar­kets and dis­rupt del­i­cate sup­ply chains across Europe and beyond as the world tries to cope with the vast eco­nomic cost of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ster­ling fell by more than 1 per cent to six-week lows ver­sus the euro and also dropped against the dol­lar to US$1.327.</p>
    <p>With just days left for a deal to be agreed on, EU diplo­mats said it was a de­ci­sive mo­ment for both Bri­tain and the bloc which built the ru­ined na­tions of Europe into a global power af­ter the dev­as­ta­tion of World War II.</p>
    <p>In a move that could fur­ther un­der­mine the talks, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment will press ahead with draft laws this week that would breach Lon­don’s ear­lier di­vorce treaty with the bloc.</p>
    <p>Ju­nior For­eign Of­fice Min­is­ter James Clev­erly said yes­ter­day the clauses that breach the treaty would be re-in­serted.</p>
