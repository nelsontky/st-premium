    <p>Ja­pan logged at least 2,201 Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day in a new daily high, with one-day records in Tokyo, Kana­gawa and Saitama. Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike is ex­pected to raise the Covid-19 alert level to the high­est on the cap­i­tal’s four-tier scale to­day, fol­low­ing a meet­ing with med­i­cal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan logged at least 2,201 Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day in a new daily high, with one-day records in Tokyo, Kana­gawa and Saitama that are part of the world’s largest met­ro­pol­i­tan area by pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This was a leap from the pre­vi­ous peak of 1,736 cases na­tion­wide, set just last Satur­day, and comes as the spread of Covid-19 ap­pears to be gath­er­ing pace across Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Fears of a virus resur­gence sent Ja­panese shares lower yes­ter­day, with the Nikkei 225 in­dex shed­ding 1.1 per cent a day after climb­ing to its high­est level since 1991.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said last night that he was ex­tremely con­cerned by the ris­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions. Un­like in the pre­vi­ous wave which com­prised mainly youth in nightlife dis­tricts, this is now oc­cur­ring among mid­dle-aged and el­derly cit­i­zens. Clus­ters are also ap­pear­ing across dif­fer­ent sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Tokyo recorded 493 cases yes­ter­day, top­ping the pre­vi­ous peak of 472 set dur­ing the height of the se­cond wave on Aug 1.</p>
    <p>Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike is ex­pected to raise the Covid-19 alert level to the high­est on the cap­i­tal’s four-tier scale to­day, fol­low­ing a meet­ing with med­i­cal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>While the fine print of what mea­sures this will en­tail re­mained to be worked out, Ja­panese me­dia cited un­named sources as say­ing that a rein­tro­duc­tion of guide­lines for food and bev­er­age out­lets to shut early might be on the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Osaka, Nagoya and Sap­poro, all of which have seen a spike in in­fec­tions in re­cent weeks, have is­sued guide­lines urg­ing those who dine out to cap the party size at four peo­ple and the du­ra­tion at two hours.</p>
    <p>Hokkaido raised its Covid-19 alert on Mon­day and its cap­i­tal, Sap­poro, has ad­vised F&B out­lets to shut be­tween 10pm and 5am while ask­ing res­i­dents to avoid mak­ing non-es­sen­tial out­ings.</p>
    <p>The lat­est spike is bad news for the F&B in­dus­try, which has been count­ing on the bumper year-end “bo­nenkai” or for­get-the-year</p>
    <p>The resur­gence is caus­ing alarm, es­pe­cially in Ja­pan’s ru­ral re­gions where lo­cal of­fi­cials are spooked by the spec­tre of a po­ten­tial short­age of hos­pi­tal beds amid the ris­ing num­bers of in­fec­tions among the mid­dle-aged and el­derly.</p>
    <p>party, sea­son to keep the tills ring­ing.</p>
    <p>When ob­serv­ing this Ja­panese tra­di­tion, friends and col­leagues usu­ally gather over co­pi­ous amounts of food and al­co­hol to for­get the woes of the year gone by.</p>
    <p>And in a blow to the gov­ern­ment’s much touted Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign, travel agen­cies are re­port­ing can­cel­la­tions by mem­bers of the public who are hes­i­tat­ing to go on va­ca­tion, out of either a sense of so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity or a fear of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Shigeru Omi, who heads a gov­ern­ment panel of med­i­cal ex­perts, said yes­ter­day that the gov­ern­ment might have to again con­sider plac­ing lim­its on so­cial and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He warned: “This is the time for ev­ery­one to ex­er­cise re­straint to pre­vent this from hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Toshio Nak­a­gawa urged the public to avoid mak­ing non-es­sen­tial trips dur­ing the three-day-long week­end end­ing next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Tokyo, also set­ting new daily records yes­ter­day were Kana­gawa to the cap­i­tal’s south, with 226 cases, and Saitama to the north, with 126 cases. Along with Chiba, with 66 cases, they ac­count for about a third of Ja­pan’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Shizuoka and Nagano, which are pop­u­lar day-trip des­ti­na­tions from Tokyo, also set new one-day highs of 87 and 30 cases re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Osaka’s 273 cases yes­ter­day was its se­cond-high­est count, while Hokkaido’s 233 cases marked its third-high­est one-day tally.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence is caus­ing alarm, es­pe­cially in Ja­pan’s ru­ral re­gions where lo­cal of­fi­cials are spooked by the spec­tre of a po­ten­tial short­age of hos­pi­tal beds amid the ris­ing num­bers of in­fec­tions among the mid­dle-aged and el­derly.</p>
    <p>The spread means the prospect of re­open­ing borders for leisure is fast di­min­ish­ing.</p>
    <p>Olympics Min­is­ter Seiko Hashimoto, in recog­nis­ing the do­mes­tic and global spike, told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that the gov­ern­ment is look­ing at plans to cap the num­ber of for­eign spec­ta­tors at next year’s Games.</p>
