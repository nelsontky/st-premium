    <p>Cou­ples un­der­go­ing in-vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion (IVF) who wish to have their em­bryos screened for se­ri­ous ge­netic dis­or­ders be­fore they are im­planted in the womb may get fi­nan­cial help for it, if an on­go­ing re­view finds it fea­si­ble to sub­sidise such pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) is cur­rently work­ing to make Pre-im­plan­ta­tion Ge­netic Di­ag­no­sis (PGD) a main­stream clin­i­cal ser­vice for cou­ples who need it, and is study­ing whether it is cost ef­fec­tive to make it el­i­gi­ble for sub­si­dies, said Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She was re­spond­ing to Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC), who sug­gested sev­eral ways the Govern­ment could give more sup­port to cou­ples try­ing to con­ceive through the costly and emo­tion­ally try­ing process of IVF.</p>
    <p>PGD is an op­tion of­fered to pa­tients at risk of pass­ing on se­ri­ous in­her­i­ta­ble dis­eases that are due to sin­gle gene mu­ta­tions or chro­mo­so­mal struc­tural re­arrange­ments.</p>
    <p>Screen­ing may in­crease the like­li­hood of a suc­cess­ful preg­nancy by en­sur­ing the im­planted em­bryo is free from such ge­netic de­fects and lower the over­all costs as fewer IVF cy­cles would then be needed, ar­gued Mr Ng, in mak­ing his case for ex­tend­ing sub­si­dies to PGD and let­ting cou­ples use their MediSave to pay the bal­ance.</p>
    <p>PGD is cur­rently not sub­sidised and can­not be paid for through MediSave, but Ms Ra­hayu said MOH would study Mr Ng’s sug­ges­tion to al­low MediSave to be used.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said one cou­ple had told him they had paid $18,000 out of pocket for PGD as it was the only way to pre­vent their sec­ond child from in­her­it­ing a rare ge­netic dis­ease that can lead to liver fail­ure.</p>
    <p>“My pro­posal is that we ex­tend the cur­rent IVF sub­sidy struc­ture to PGD. For Sin­ga­porean cou­ples, this means a 75 per cent sub­sidy for PGD for sub­sidised IVF cy­cles,” Mr Ng said. “PGD is needed only by a small per­cent­age of cou­ples, so over­all sub­sidy costs for the Govern­ment are likely to be lim­ited.”</p>
    <p>In his ad­journ­ment mo­tion, which al­lows MPs to speak for up to 20 min­utes at the close of a Par­lia­ment sit­ting, Mr Ng cited fig­ures from KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal that show 15 per cent of cou­ples are un­able to con­ceive within a year of try­ing for a baby.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cou­ples opt­ing for IVF has also risen in re­cent years, from about 5,500 in 2013 to over 7,700 in 2017, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng re­vealed that his three daugh­ters were con­ceived through IVF and that he and his wife were able to have their first child only on their sev­enth at­tempt.</p>
    <p>He noted the Govern­ment sub­sidises the first six IVF cy­cles and cou­ples will have to foot the bill in full from the sev­enth at­tempt on­ward, which can cost up to $15,000 at pub­lic hos­pi­tals. He sug­gested sub­si­dies could be ex­tended to the sev­enth and eighth cy­cles, even if the sub­sidy amount is re­duced.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng also sug­gested that quo­tas on “fresh” and “frozen” cy­cles for sub­sidised IVF treat­ment be scrapped. These re­fer to dif­fer­ent meth­ods of em­bryo trans­fer used in IVF. Cur­rently, the six sub­sidised cy­cles must con­sist of three “fresh” and three “frozen” cy­cles.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said cou­ples should have flex­i­bil­ity to opt for ei­ther method.</p>
    <p>They should also get fer­til­ity leave so they can take time off work to go for IVF, Mr Ng sug­gested, not­ing that coun­tries like South Korea have such schemes.</p>
    <p>In her re­sponse, Ms Ra­hayu said the Govern­ment has made ef­forts to im­prove the af­ford­abil­ity of as­sisted re­pro­duc­tion tech­nol­ogy (ART) by in­creas­ing the sub­sidy cap pro­gres­sively over the years.</p>
    <p>She said cou­ples can also use MediSave to off­set out-of-pocket costs at both pri­vate and pub­lic ART cen­tres, sub­ject to a life­time limit of $15,000 which can come from ei­ther the wife’s or the hus­band’s MediSave ac­count.</p>
    <p>On Mr Ng’s sug­ges­tion to in­crease the num­ber of sub­sidised IVF cy­cles, Ms Ra­hayu said co-fund­ing sub­si­dies need to be fea­si­ble and con­sider that the suc­cess rate of IVF treat­ments de­creases with each suc­ces­sive cy­cle. “We will mon­i­tor the clin­i­cal ev­i­dence and re­view this cri­te­ria if new data sug­gests im­proved out­comes,” she said.</p>
    <p>She also said that though the sub­sidy for IVF cy­cles cov­ers three fresh and three frozen cy­cles, the min­istry al­ready al­lows some flex­i­bil­ity for cou­ples to claim fund­ing for more of one or the other.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, a pa­tient who has utilised one fresh cy­cle and three frozen cy­cles can re­quest co-fund­ing for an ad­di­tional frozen cy­cle.”</p>
    <p>She said that in this sce­nario, the amount of co-fund­ing would be based on the $2,200 cap for frozen cy­cles rather than the $7,700 cap for fresh cy­cles. The pa­tient will then have one re­main­ing fresh cy­cle that can be co-funded.</p>
    <p>A pa­tient who has un­der­gone one frozen and three fresh cy­cles can also re­quest fund­ing for a fourth fresh cy­cle, but the sub­sidy will still be capped at $2,200.</p>
    <p>On the sug­ges­tion for fer­til­ity leave, Ms Ra­hayu said women un­der­go­ing as­sisted con­cep­tion pro­ce­dures can al­ready use their hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion leave. She said some em­ploy­ers will also al­low men a day off work if they get a memo from the doc­tor for ac­com­pa­ny­ing their wives to the clinic.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to be sen­si­tive to the needs of cou­ples who may need to make use of these ex­ist­ing pro­vi­sions,” she said, adding that a bal­ance must be struck be­tween meet­ing em­ploy­ees’ needs and the op­er­a­tional con­straints faced by em­ploy­ers.</p>
