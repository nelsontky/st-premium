    <p>Cash does not have the sta­tus it used to. Con­cerns about a de­cline in the ac­cep­tance of cash sur­faced well be­fore the coro­n­avirus ar­rived, as con­sumers grew more com­fort­able shop­ping on­line with credit or debit cards and pay­ing quickly with mo­bile apps. Many busi­nesses like elec­tronic pay­ments be­cause they speed up pur­chases and re­duce con­cerns about theft.</p>
    <p>Then, dur­ing the pan­demic, restau­rants and stores em­pha­sised on­line or­der­ing and dig­i­tal pay­ment to re­duce in­ter­ac­tions – and the risk of in­fec­tion – among cus­tomers and em­ploy­ees. And, as con­sumers stayed home, coin short­ages oc­curred, mak­ing it dif­fi­cult for some stores to give change. That added to a pref­er­ence for elec­tronic pay­ments.</p>
    <p>But as dig­i­tal pay­ments be­come more wide­spread, “we’re con­cerned that peo­ple aren’t go­ing to be able to pay for ne­ces­si­ties”, said Ms Linda Sherry, di­rec­tor of na­tional pri­or­i­ties at Con­sumer Ac­tion, an Amer­i­can ad­vo­cacy group.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that refuse cash put at a dis­ad­van­tage peo­ple who lack tra­di­tional bank ac­counts or can­not qual­ify for credit cards, con­sumer ad­vo­cates say.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple still like cash be­cause it helps them bud­get their money or teach their chil­dren about spend­ing. Oth­ers may be wary of a loss of pri­vacy and vul­ner­a­bil­ity to hack­ing with elec­tronic pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers still use cash for more than one-quar­ter of all pay­ments in the United States – cash was used for al­most half the pay­ments un­der US$10 (S$13.60).</p>
    <p>And, con­trary to pop­u­lar per­cep­tion, 70 per cent of those sur­veyed amid the pan­demic in April and May said they were not avoid­ing cash be­cause of con­cern about the virus. Cash re­mains im­por­tant to con­sumers de­spite a menu of com­pet­ing pay­ment op­tions.</p>
    <p>“Many con­sumers value and pre­fer to use cash for ev­ery­day pur­chases, while oth­ers use cash as a backup or for the con­ve­nience of small-value pay­ments,” said Mr Mark Gould, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of the Fed­eral Re­serve Bank of San Francisco.</p>
    <p>Ms Shelle San­tana, a vis­it­ing scholar at Har­vard Busi­ness School who has stud­ied pay­ment trends, said it was un­clear how ag­gres­sive the en­force­ment of the cash re­quire­ments had been dur­ing the pan­demic. She said she fore­saw a “less cash” so­ci­ety, rather than a truly cash­less one, in the near term, be­cause many peo­ple con­tinue to rely on hard cur­rency.</p>
    <p>Some busi­nesses that stopped ac­cept­ing cash have re­versed their poli­cies vol­un­tar­ily, she noted, after re­al­is­ing they were ex­clud­ing some cus­tomers. “No one,” she said, “wants to turn away busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Here are a cou­ple of ques­tions and an­swers about pay­ing with cash:</p>
    <p>CASH STILL LE­GAL TEN­DER?</p>
    <p>Cur­rently there is no law to state that busi­nesses must ac­cept cash or coins as pay­ment.</p>
    <p>“Pri­vate busi­nesses are free to de­velop their own poli­cies on whether or not to ac­cept cash” un­less state law says oth­er­wise. Busi­nesses like movie the­atres, con­ve­nience stores and petrol sta­tions may refuse to ac­cept bills over US$20, and bus lines</p>
    <p>may ban pay­ment of fares in one­cent coins, the US Trea­sury De­part­ment says.</p>
    <p>IS IT SAFE TO PAY WITH CASH DUR­ING THE PAN­DEMIC?</p>
    <p>The virus that causes Covid-19 is mainly trans­mit­ted through close per­son-to-per­son con­tact, the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) says.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble that some­one could be­come in­fected by touch­ing a sur­face or an ob­ject with the virus on it, but “this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads”, ac­cord­ing to the agency.</p>
    <p>While there has been con­cern that han­dling cash can spread germs, touch­ing a pay­ment ter­mi­nal or hand­ing a plas­tic card to a clerk may also pose a risk.</p>
    <p>The CDC sug­gests us­ing touch­less pay­ment if pos­si­ble. “If you must han­dle money, a card or use a key­pad, use hand sani­tiser right after pay­ing,” it says.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has said that “it is good hy­giene prac­tice to wash your hands after han­dling money, es­pe­cially if eat­ing or han­dling food”.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple still like cash be­cause it helps them bud­get their money or teach their chil­dren about spend­ing.</p>
