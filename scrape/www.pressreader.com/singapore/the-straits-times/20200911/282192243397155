    <p>LONDON • Ever since Ro­man Abramovich bought Chelsea in June 2003, the Blues have never en­dured back-to-back tro­phy­less sea­sons. The Rus­sian is un­likely to en­ter­tain that pos­si­bil­ity af­ter tak­ing his over­all bankroll to £1.8 bil­lion (S$3.2 bil­lion) ahead of the new Pre­mier League sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Lon­don­ers have been the top flight’s most ac­tive buy­ers in the close sea­son, in stark con­trast to a year ago when they were sub­ject to a Fifa trans­fer ban, giv­ing their young­sters a chance to shine.</p>
    <p>Ger­many striker Timo Werner ar­rives from RB Leipzig hav­ing scored 28 times in the Bun­desliga last sea­son, while in­ter­na­tional team­mate Kai Havertz plays like his new man­ager Frank Lam­pard in his pomp, with runs from mid­field into the box to score. At the other end, Eng­land left-back Ben Chilwell and Brazil vet­eran Thi­ago Silva, mov­ing from Le­ices­ter City and Paris Sain­tGer­main re­spec­tively, should im­prove a de­fence that con­ceded 54 league goals en route to los­ing 12 games last term. The last time they let in more was in 1997.</p>
    <p>Chelsea had al­ready snapped up Morocco winger Hakim Ziyech af­ter he bam­boo­zled them in last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League group stage play­ing for Ajax Am­s­ter­dam. Like Werner, his first train­ing ses­sion at Cob­ham was in July, and they have both set­tled into their new en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The cheque­book re­mains out, with the club in talks with Rennes for goal­keeper Edouard Mendy.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard is still in the mar­ket for a No. 1 to re­place Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga, the world’s most ex­pen­sive stop­per, and solve Chelsea’s big­gest prob­lem area left.</p>
    <p>Sene­gal in­ter­na­tional Mendy was a key man in the team who fin­ished third in Ligue One and qual­i­fied for the Cham­pi­ons League for the first time in their his­tory.</p>
    <p>“Chelsea aren’t buy­ing a team, they are buy­ing and build­ing a dy­nasty, which I think is ex­traor­di­nar­ily ex­cit­ing,” for­mer Blues winger Pat Nevin told the BBC.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, Lam­pard named the youngest Chelsea XI of the Pre­mier League era, with an av­er­age age of 24 years and 88 days.</p>
    <p>Ma­son Mount, 21, Fikayo To­mori, 22, Reece James, 20, Tammy Abra­ham, 22, and Christian Pulisic, 21, were among the starters in their 2-0 win over Crys­tal Palace. And just un­der half of Chelsea’s goals last sea­son were scored by play­ers 22 or younger.</p>
    <p>While those young­sters – with the ex­cep­tion of Pulisic – are no longer cer­tain of get­ting reg­u­lar play­ing time, new sign­ings like Werner, 24, Havertz, 21, Chilwell, 23, and France Un­der-21 de­fender Malang Sarr, 21, prove that Chelsea are not just look­ing at the present but the fu­ture too. The ques­tion is whether Lam­pard will re­main at the club be­yond his cur­rent con­tract, which ex­pires in 2022.</p>
    <p>The Blues leg­end ex­ceeded most peo­ple’s ex­pec­ta­tions in his first cam­paign as coach at Stam­ford Bridge by se­cur­ing a fourth-place fin­ish de­spite los­ing star man Eden Haz­ard to Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>Such mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors meant that Lam­pard was ef­fec­tively given a free hit last cam­paign. And while Chelsea qual­i­fied for the Cham­pi­ons League, they se­cured six points fewer than un­der Mau­r­izio Sarri in 2018-19 and fin­ished 33 points be­hind cham­pi­ons Liver­pool and 15 off sec­ond-placed Manch­ester City.</p>
    <p>Chelsea also lost the FA Cup fi­nal to Arse­nal and went out of the Cham­pi­ons League 7-1 on ag­gre­gate in the round of 16 against even­tual win­ners Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>In the Abramovich era, Lam­pard and Jose Mour­inho (2013-14) are the only man­agers to avoid the sack af­ter fail­ing to de­liver a tro­phy.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard, the club’s record scorer, knows he must aim higher this term and add to the owner’s 16 pieces of ma­jor sil­ver­ware, es­pe­cially af­ter a near £200 mil­lion out­lay on new play­ers.</p>
    <p>“Frank will be to­tally aware of the pres­sure, but that comes with every Chelsea manger,” for­mer Blues striker Tony Cascarino told talkSport. “Chelsea sack man­agers that have done far more in terms of win­ning than Frank. OK, not un­der the same cir­cum­stances as Lam­pard, but he will be to­tally aware of it. Will he get more time be­cause he’s a leg­end? No, not now the wig­gle room has gone.”</p>
    <p>I didn’t come in the job to fight for fourth place or bring academy play­ers in, I came here to win. Last year we couldn’t re­cruit and this year the club have made the de­ci­sion to bring in play­ers. It changes the land­scape and</p>
    <p>we’re ’’ ready to work.</p>
