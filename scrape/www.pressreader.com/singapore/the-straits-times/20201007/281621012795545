    <p>Blog­ger Leong Sze Hian had con­tin­ued to in­sist an ar­ti­cle that falsely linked Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong to the 1MDB scan­dal was true, even af­ter he re­moved a Face­book post about it, PM Lee’s lawyers said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In fact, Mr Leong had in­sisted he did not be­lieve the Gov­ern­ment’s re­but­tals of the ar­ti­cle, ti­tled “Lee Hsien Loong be­comes 1MDB’s key in­ves­ti­ga­tion tar­get”.</p>
    <p>The blog­ger had said there was no way the Gov­ern­ment could pos­si­bly know if the Malaysian au­thor­i­ties were look­ing into PM Lee’s role in the cor­rup­tion probe.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter var­i­ous Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ment agen­cies and the au­thor­i­ties had dis­cred­ited the claims, Mr Leong had kept the post up on his Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing these ac­tions yes­ter­day, Mr Davin­der Singh from Davin­der Singh Cham­bers said in his open­ing state­ment to the High Court that it was clear that Mr Leong’s con­duct was “ma­li­cious”.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh cast doubts on Mr Leong’s claim that he had never in­tended to re­pub­lish the ar­ti­cle and had re­moved it will­ingly and im­me­di­ately, adding: “It would there­fore ap­pear that he re­moved the ar­ti­cle out of self-preser­va­tion, and not out of con­tri­tion.”</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle by The Cov­er­age, a Malaysian web­site, had said that PM Lee was “cor­rupted” and had signed deals with his for­mer Malaysian coun­ter­part Na­jib Razak that were un­favourable to Malaysia “in ex­change for Sin­ga­pore banks’ as­sis­tance in money laun­der­ing 1MDB’s bil­lions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong had shared it on his Face­book page on Nov 7, 2018, with his post shared by at least 18 oth­ers and at­tract­ing five com­ments.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing aware of the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment’s re­but­tal of the ar­ti­cle, Mr Leong had left the post on­line un­til Nov 10, 2018, re­mov­ing it only af­ter he re­ceived a no­tice from the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity.</p>
    <p>Even then, he re­fused to apol­o­gise or un­der­take not to re­peat the claims, and con­tin­ued to in­sist it was not fake news, said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>And af­ter be­ing sued by PM Lee for li­bel, Mr Leong had taken ev­ery op­por­tu­nity to draw at­ten­tion to the mat­ter on var­i­ous fora, mak­ing pub­lic the le­gal doc­u­ments on Face­book and speak­ing about the is­sue at in­ter­views and pub­lic events, the lawyer added.</p>
    <p>At one point, Mr Leong even paid for an ad­ver­tise­ment to boost a Face­book post link­ing to The On­line Cit­i­zen’s ar­ti­cle about the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing this pat­tern of con­duct as be­ing par­tic­u­larly egre­gious, Mr Singh said Mr Leong had used the suit “to wage a pub­lic cam­paign to gain sym­pa­thy and sup­port, and in do­ing so cyn­i­cally draw­ing at­ten­tion to the post and the ar­ti­cle to keep them fresh in the minds of peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>What made the li­bel worse was that “what was used as a launch pad to strike was the sin­gle largest and most sen­sa­tional scan­dal in re­cent mem­ory in­volv­ing what the pub­lic in Sin­ga­pore has come to as­so­ciate with cor­rup­tion and crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity, and which re­port­edly brought down the prime min­is­ter and gov­ern­ment of an­other coun­try”, he added.</p>
    <p>He noted that in the months be­fore Mr Leong had shared the ar­ti­cle, nu­mer­ous me­dia out­lets had re­ported about the cor­rupt and crim­i­nal con­duct linked to 1MDB.</p>
    <p>Falsely ac­cus­ing PM Lee of be­ing in­volved had “gravely in­jured” and “brought into pub­lic scan­dal, odium and con­tempt” his char­ac­ter and rep­u­ta­tion, said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>He also took is­sue with Mr Leong’s use of Face­book to share the ar­ti­cle, highlighti­ng that the blog­ger had set the post to “pub­lic”.</p>
    <p>This en­sured that the post would reach even those who are not on his list of 5,000 Face­book friends, said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>He quoted Dr Phan Tuan Quang, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong who has taught and re­searched so­cial me­dia for more than 15 years, in es­ti­mat­ing that the post could have ap­peared on the Face­book news feeds of some 11,749 users.</p>
    <p>Dr Phan, who will take the stand to­day, will also speak about how this would in­clude at the very min­i­mum some 200 to 400 Sin­ga­pore­ans, many of whom could be in­ter­ested in pol­i­tics, since Mr Leong had pro­claimed him­self as a prom­i­nent gov­ern­ment critic who writes fre­quently on such is­sues, added Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong had said that he was be­ing per­se­cuted by PM Lee for crit­i­cis­ing the Gov­ern­ment, and that the defama­tion suit was an abuse of the le­gal process to scare off all other gov­ern­ment crit­ics.</p>
    <p>But Mr Singh said the facts un­der­mine this “fan­ci­ful ar­gu­ment”, as PM Lee had never once sued him in the past de­spite him hav­ing writ­ten many crit­i­cal ar­ti­cles about gov­ern­ment poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Mr Leong had de­famed PM Lee this time, Mr Singh said that a li­bel and slan­der of a pub­lic leader in Sin­ga­pore dam­ages not only his per­sonal rep­u­ta­tion, but also the rep­u­ta­tion of Sin­ga­pore, and com­pro­mises his moral author­ity to lead.</p>
    <p>He is seek­ing sub­stan­tial dam­ages and an in­junc­tion that Mr Leong be re­strained from pub­lish­ing or dis­sem­i­nat­ing the defam­a­tory al­le­ga­tions by any means.</p>
    <p>He added: “While any­one, in­clud­ing (Mr Leong), is en­ti­tled to crit­i­cise (PM Lee) or his poli­cies, no one has the right to falsely de­fame.”</p>
