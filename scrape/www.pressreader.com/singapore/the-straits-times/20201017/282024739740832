    <p>One of the seven peo­ple linked to the high-pro­file Or­chard Tow­ers mur­der in July last year has been given a con­di­tional warn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan Jia Xing, 27, was orig­i­nally charged with the mur­der of Mr Satheesh Noel Go­bidass, 31, along with six oth­ers. His charge was later re­duced to that of con­sort­ing with a per­son car­ry­ing an of­fen­sive weapon in a pub­lic place.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Mr Chan was given a con­di­tional warn­ing, which means he has to re­frain from any crim­i­nal con­duct for a year. A con­di­tional warn­ing does not amount to a con­vic­tion or a find­ing of guilt, and does not leave a crim­i­nal record.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if Mr Chan com­mits an of­fence within one year, he can be pros­e­cuted again for the con­sort­ing charge and for the new of­fence.</p>
    <p>He is the fourth of seven linked to the Or­chard Tow­ers mur­der to be dealt with. The oth­ers are: Tan Hong Sheng, 23; Natalie Siow Yu Zhen, 24; Loo Boon Chong, 26; Tan Sen Yang, 28; Joel Tan Yun Sheng, 26; and Ang Da Yuan, 26.</p>
    <p>The group had gone to Naughty Girl Club on the sec­ond floor of Or­chard Tow­ers in the wee hours of July 2 last year. They were about to leave at around 6.20am when they ran into another group walk­ing in, af­ter which a dis­pute en­sued.</p>
    <p>Mr Satheesh was killed af­ter he con­fronted one of the men in­volved in the dis­pute who, along with his friends, at­tacked him.</p>
    <p>Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage showed Mr Satheesh ex­chang­ing blows with some in­di­vid­u­als be­fore he stum­bled in front of the build­ing’s glass doors. He ap­peared to be bleed­ing from his neck and died later that morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia out­side the State Courts on Thurs­day, Mr Chan said he had wor­ried about the out­come of his case.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents en­cour­aged me to be strong, and not to do stupid things. I am look­ing for­ward to go­ing to work and find­ing a proper job,” Mr Chan said. He added that he has not been in con­tact with the oth­ers in­volved in the case.</p>
    <p>“I will re­main crime-free not only be­yond this year, but for the rest of my life,” Mr Chan added.</p>
    <p>De­fence lawyer Jose­phus Tan said he and his client were grate­ful to the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers for “com­ing to the right de­ci­sion”, and with­draw­ing the charge against Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“It’s been an ar­du­ous jour­ney for him. He is now hap­pily look­ing for­ward to the birth of his first­born next month in­stead of hav­ing to serve time in prison for this very un­for­tu­nate tragedy.”</p>
    <p>Natalie Siow, the sole woman in the case, was sen­tenced last Fri­day to five months’ jail. She had pleaded guilty to as­sault, and to be­ing in the com­pany of Tan Sen Yang, who had a ker­am­bit knife – a curved blade re­sem­bling a claw – in his pos­ses­sion at the shop­ping mall prior to the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Of­fice ad­min­is­tra­tor Joel Tan and ho­tel re­cep­tion­ist Ang Da Yuan were dealt with in court in March. Ang was sen­tenced to eight months’ jail and six strokes of the cane for as­sault and be­ing in the com­pany of Tan Sen Yang. Joel Tan was jailed for four weeks for as­sault.</p>
    <p>Tan Sen Yang is the only one still fac­ing a mur­der charge. His case and those of Tan Hong Sheng and Loo Boon Chong are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Tan Hong Sheng has had the ini­tial mur­der charge against him re­duced to that of con­sort­ing with a per­son car­ry­ing an of­fen­sive weapon in a pub­lic place. Loo also faces a con­sort­ing charge.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of mur­der will face the death penalty.</p>
    <p>For con­sort­ing with a per­son car­ry­ing an of­fen­sive weapon in a pub­lic place, one can be jailed for up to three years and caned.</p>
