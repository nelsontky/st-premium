    <p>LEFT BEREFT</p>
    <p>Chi­nese in the US and busi­ness own­ers have re­acted with dis­may and outrage to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ban on Chi­nese-owned apps WeChat and TikTok, fear­ing it could leave them cut off from fam­ily, friends and cus­tomers in China.</p>
    <p>They scram­bled to back up mes­sages and con­tacts and find other mes­sag­ing apps to use, as news broke on Fri­day morn­ing of the ban on fu­ture down­loads of WeChat that takes ef­fect today.</p>
    <p>Video-shar­ing app TikTok will be banned from Nov 12. But the WeChat ban hit harder for many peo­ple of Chi­nese de­scent in Amer­ica, par­tic­u­larly fresh im­mi­grants, who de­pend on the so­cial me­dia app to com­mu­ni­cate with loved ones in main­land China, where other apps like What­sApp and Tele­gram are banned.</p>
    <p>“This isn’t just maybe one or two fam­ily mem­bers that we won’t be able to talk to reg­u­larly any­more, this is our en­tire ex­tended fam­ily that we’re los­ing con­tact with,” said Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley, un­der­grad­u­ate Michelle Lin in a Twit­ter thread that went vi­ral.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin, whose par­ents em­i­grated to the US from China over 20 years ago, said WeChat’s ar­rival in 2011 was the first time she was able to speak to and get to know her cousins and grand­par­ents.</p>
    <p>“I’d never even known what it was like to have rel­a­tives, I didn’t re­alise how much strength be­ing con­nected to fam­ily out there can give,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>“My 90-plus-year-old grand­fa­ther learnt to use the app to bet­ter com­mu­ni­cate with us over­seas,” she said. “He sends me lit­tle mes­sages... it lit­er­ally keeps me go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can busi­nesses with sup­pli­ers and cus­tomers in China reeled from the news that WeChat trans­ac­tions would be banned.</p>
    <p>The twin bans are part of a larger clam­p­down on Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy, in­clud­ing tech gi­ant Huawei’s phones and in­volve­ment in 5G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­works, which the White House and law­mak­ers say poses threats to Amer­ica’s na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the back­lash in Amer­ica, WeChat’s owner Ten­cent Hold­ings has cho­sen Sin­ga­pore as its re­gional hub in Asia, Bloomberg re­ported last week.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent WeChat users, of which there are more than 50 mil­lion ac­tive in the US, will not be im­me­di­ately af­fected if they al­ready have the app on their phones.</p>
    <p>But WeChat ap­pears headed for a slow death in the US, cut off from up­dates and se­cu­rity patches via the of­fi­cial app store, as well as from host­ing and net­work services that sup­port the app.</p>
    <p>“Since the WeChat ban tar­gets all the net­work sup­port services that speed com­mu­ni­ca­tions, net­work lag could well make it im­pos­si­ble to make voice or video calls be­tween US and China on WeChat,” ed­i­torin-chief Gra­ham Webster of the DigiChina project be­tween Stan­ford Univer­sity and the New Amer­ica think-tank tweeted.</p>
    <p>“Many fam­i­lies – who can’t travel dur­ing a pan­demic – could have their chan­nels cut,” he added.</p>
    <p>Some sug­gested switch­ing to Ten­cent-owned in­stant mes­sag­ing app QQ, which has not been af­fected by the curbs so far. But Repub­li­can law­maker Marco Ru­bio, in a let­ter on Sept 11, urged Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to ban it as well.</p>
    <p>The US WeChat Users Al­liance, a group of Chi­nese Amer­i­can lawyers un­af­fil­i­ated with WeChat, has called the move an un­con­sti­tu­tional one that racially tar­gets Chi­nese in Amer­ica, point­ing out that many also use WeChat to com­mu­ni­cate with fel­low Chi­nese in Amer­ica. It is seek­ing a pre­lim­i­nary in­junc­tion in court to stop the ban.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy ex­perts say new se­cu­rity risks could be in­tro­duced by users try­ing to by­pass the curbs by in­stalling un­ver­i­fied apps, called side­load­ing, or by re­mov­ing re­stric­tions from a phone to al­low such apps to be in­stalled, or jail­break­ing.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say the ban is akin to cen­sor­ship and runs counter to Amer­i­can val­ues of free­dom of speech.</p>
    <p>This isn’t just maybe one or two fam­ily mem­bers that we won’t be able to talk to reg­u­larly any­more, this is our en­tire ex­tended fam­ily that we’re los­ing con­tact ’’ with.</p>

    <p>MAIN­TAIN FAIR RULES</p>
    <p>China urges the US to aban­don bul­ly­ing, cease (its) wrong­ful ac­tions and earnestly main­tain fair and trans­par­ent in­ter­na­tional rules and ’’ or­der.</p>
