    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment an­nounced a £300 mil­lion (S$534.5 mil­lion) “win­ter sur­vival pack­age” on Thurs­day to help sport through the Covid-19 pan­demic, with rugby set for the big­gest share but noth­ing for toplevel foot­ball and cricket.</p>
    <p>The first pay­ments will be made over the com­ing weeks, mainly as low-in­ter­est loans with flex­i­ble terms but also through grants.</p>
    <p>The money cov­ers sport in Eng­land, with other parts of the United King­dom hav­ing sep­a­rate bud­gets.</p>
    <p>Sports Min­is­ter Nigel Hud­dle­ston told par­lia­ment it was clear some clubs would go to the wall un­less ac­tion was taken.</p>
    <p>“We know the de­ci­sion taken in late Septem­ber not to re­open sta­dia from Oct 1 has had ma­jor con­se­quences for sports clubs large and small,” he said. “Clearly, for many or­gan­i­sa­tions, not be­ing able to gen­er­ate gate re­ceipts de­prives them of a ma­jor source of in­come.”</p>
    <p>Sup­port will be pro­vided to both rugby codes, horse rac­ing, the Na­tional League and women’s foot­ball, mo­tor sport, ten­nis, net­ball, bas­ket­ball, ice hockey, bad­minton and grey­hound rac­ing.</p>
    <p>More than 100 sports bod­ies wrote to Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son in Septem­ber ask­ing for emer­gency fund­ing and warn­ing of “a lost gen­er­a­tion of ac­tiv­ity”.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary al­lo­ca­tions by sport, based on needs as­sess­ment, saw rugby union top the list with £135 mil­lion. Premier­ship rugby clubs, who warned of bank­rupt­cies with­out state aid, ac­counted for £59 mil­lion and the na­tional Rugby Foot­ball Union £44 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Horse rac­ing will get £40 mil­lion to sup­port race­courses closed to spec­ta­tors, while the Na­tional League, which sits below the Foot­ball league, and women’s foot­ball re­ceive £28 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor sport, which em­ploys more than 40,000 in Bri­tain, was al­lo­cated £6 mil­lion to help op­er­a­tors of cir­cuits like Sil­ver­stone.</p>
    <p>“Today’s pro­vi­sional al­lo­ca­tions aren’t the end of the story. The door is open for any sport to ap­ply where there’s a need and this in­cludes cricket and oth­ers who aren’t in the ini­tial list of al­lo­ca­tions,” said Hud­dle­ston.</p>
    <p>“This is a win­ter sur­vival pack­age. It is not meant to be a full pound-for-pound com­pen­sa­tion for lost rev­enue.”</p>
    <p>Bad­minton Eng­land chief ex­ec­u­tive Adrian Christy told the BBC his sport had lost more than £2.2 mil­lion in in­come since the start of the pan­demic but the pack­age would help close the gap.</p>
    <p>Swim­ming was not on the list and Swim Eng­land chief ex­ec­u­tive Jane Nick­er­son said aquatic sports were also in a fight for sur­vival and needed sup­port.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has said it ex­pects pro­fes­sional men’s foot­ball to sup­port it­self, with wealthy Pre­mier League clubs en­joy­ing lu­cra­tive tele­vi­sion deals and con­sid­er­able spon­sor­ship.</p>
