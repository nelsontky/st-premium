    <p>CAIRNS • Div­ing be­neath the ocean, Mr Rus­sell Hosp swam to­wards the lime­stone bed of the Great Bar­rier Reef, where he reat­tached bits of blue staghorn coral. With tourists gone, he was fill­ing the void with this small act of con­ser­va­tion, which took his mind off the un­cer­tain fu­ture on land.</p>
    <p>“It was a bit sur­real,” Mr Hosp, a reef guide, said of spend­ing hours at sea unac­com­pa­nied by the usual en­thu­si­as­tic vis­i­tors. Aboard the quiet cata­ma­ran, he said, he re­alised just how much the coro­n­avirus “had changed the world”.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has fast-for­warded a loom­ing reckoning for the trop­i­cal city of Cairns, the main gate­way to the reef and the base for Mr Hosp and many oth­ers whose liveli­hoods de­pend on it.</p>
    <p>Tour op­er­a­tors there were al­ready fight­ing a per­cep­tion that the reef is in its death throes, as warm­ing wa­ters cause re­peated mass bleach­ing that has robbed many corals of their vivid colours. But where cli­mate change has been more of a creep­ing threat to the reef’s sur­vival, and thus to Cairns’ tourism lifeblood, the coro­n­avirus has de­liv­ered a ham­mer blow.</p>
    <p>Now this city, so linked with the nat­u­ral won­der just off its shore that it can scarcely imag­ine life with­out the vis­i­tors who come in droves, has been forced to con­front the prospect that it can no longer de­pend on tourists.</p>
    <p>For­eign and lo­cal trav­ellers, al­ready de­terred by last sum­mer’s dev­as­tat­ing bush fires and now locked out by Aus­tralia’s in­ter­na­tional and do­mes­tic travel bans, have all but van­ished, and a US$4.6 bil­lion (S$6.3 bil­lion) in­dus­try built around the world’s largest liv­ing struc­ture has ground to a near halt.</p>
    <p>The sud­den dis­ap­pear­ance of vis­i­tors feels all the more un­real be­cause the virus it­self has barely touched Cairns: The city of 150,000 peo­ple in far north-east­ern Aus­tralia has recorded only a cou­ple of dozen cases and has none cur­rently.</p>
    <p>But there is no es­cap­ing the reach of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We’d never stopped run­ning be­fore – the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, ter­ror­ism at­tacks, air­line strikes; you name it, the world has thrown it at us,” Mr Hosp said. “We don’t know if we’ll ever get back to nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>In Cairns, vis­i­tors who usu­ally cram the jetty every morn­ing as they wait to pile onto boats have dwin­dled from the thou­sands to a few hun­dred, leav­ing op­er­a­tors out of work, boats moored at the dock, and some ho­tels and restau­rants shut­tered.</p>
    <p>Store­fronts on the main shop­ping street are for lease, and the es­planade, usu­ally heav­ing with tourists at dusk, looks like some­thing out of a sleepy beach town.</p>
    <p>“It’s been so quiet,” said Ms Heather Forbes, a Cairns res­i­dent, adding that be­cause the city had been de­pen­dent on tourism for so long, it was dif­fi­cult to know how to di­ver­sify its econ­omy. “I don’t think any­where should be solely de­pen­dent on one thing,” she said.</p>
    <p>It might seem that there was a sil­ver lin­ing in all this, that the ex­o­dus of tourists would be a boon for the health of a reef in crit­i­cal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>But while the abrupt ab­sence of vis­it­ing crowds has had sur­pris­ing ef­fects in other places – mon­keys over­run­ning a Thai city, deer wan­der­ing in Ja­panese cities look­ing for food – the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of tourism on the reef is neg­li­gi­ble, sci­en­tists say, es­pe­cially when com­pared with cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The re­duc­tion in in­ter­na­tional travel, and there­fore planet-warm­ing emis­sions, has cre­ated only a short-term ben­e­fit. The “in­fra­struc­ture of fos­sil fu­els wasn’t af­fected”, said Pro­fes­sor Terry Hughes, a global ex­pert on coral reefs at James Cook Univer­sity in Townsville, Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>In the end, a pro­longed down­turn in vis­its to the reef could ac­tu­ally be detri­men­tal to its well-be­ing. “Tourism pro­vides a so­cial and eco­nomic ra­tio­nale for why the reef needs to be bet­ter pro­tected,” Prof Hughes said.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion has prompted the Cairns re­gion to look more crit­i­cally at its de­pen­dence on in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers, es­pe­cially those from China, who make up a large por­tion of reef vis­i­tors. China and Aus­tralia are en­gaged in an in­creas­ingly bit­ter diplo­matic tug of war that could keep Chi­nese trav­ellers away even af­ter the bor­ders are re­opened.</p>
    <p>“We’re re­al­is­ing that we can’t rely on China,” said Ms Sa­man­tha David­son, a travel con­sul­tant at the Reef Info Vis­i­tor Cen­tre. “It’s good,” she added, be­cause it’s send­ing a mes­sage to those closer to home: ‘Hey, come and see us’.”</p>
    <p>As re­cent flare-ups of the coro­n­avirus have closed state bor­ders within Aus­tralia, some peo­ple have taken the op­por­tu­nity to ex­plore their own (very large) back­yards.</p>
    <p>“We were sup­posed to be in Hawaii, but we said we still wanted to take a trip some­where warm,” Ms Ali­cia Dean said as she lounged in a sarong on the deck of a boat head­ing out to the reef.</p>
    <p>She had trav­elled within the state of Queens­land from Bris­bane, the cap­i­tal, to Cairns, more than 1,600km to the north.</p>
    <p>And some for­eign­ers, stranded in Aus­tralia, fig­ured they might as well take the time to ex­pe­ri­ence the reef, a World Her­itage Site. “My flight keeps get­ting can­celled,” Ms Ju­lia Pape, 27, from Ger­many, said as she donned her flip­pers and wet suit, ready to plunge into the trop­i­cal wa­ters.</p>
