    <p>The term “young Hol­ly­wood” once de­noted a breed of way­ward child stars given to a cer­tain showy pre­co­cious­ness – a fallen Dis­ney prince or princess who, once the cam­eras stopped rolling, would be caught stum­bling out of a night­club, cham­pagne bot­tle in hand, cig­gie hang­ing off lips swollen from one too many snogs with the lat­est su­per­model.</p>
    <p>But to­day, many of the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try’s bright young things seem to have a firm head on their shoul­ders. The very bright­est tend to be driven, woke and me­di­asavvy multi-hy­phen­ates who have found a way to speak di­rectly to their fans on­line and de­ploy their celebrity for causes they gen­uinely be­lieve in.</p>
    <p>Kier­nan Shipka is just that. The ac­tress was only six when she landed her break­out role as Sally Draper, the surly, truth-telling daugh­ter of ad­ver­tis­ing man Don Draper in the ac­claimed drama Mad Men (2007 to 2015)– a role she helped turn into one of the most com­plex de­pic­tions of ado­les­cence seen on screen.</p>
    <p>Since 2018, the 20-year-old has head­lined another sub­ver­sive hit show, Net­flix’s Chill­ing Ad­ven­tures Of Sabrina, a su­per­nat­u­ral hor­ror se­ries with a post-mod­ern take on the whole­some Archie Comics char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>When she is not play­ing a teenage witch, how­ever, Shipka is cast­ing spells in a whole dif­fer­ent light.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting to Harper’s Bazaar Sin­ga­pore shortly af­ter wrap­ping up her cover shoot in Los An­ge­les, she is warm, witty and fre­quently hi­lar­i­ous, even when de­scrib­ing her plans for the evening – “to have a very chill night” af­ter hit­ting up “my one true love of a gro­cery store”, the health-food su­per­mar­ket Erewhon, where she plans to pick up “some kind of a kung pao cau­li­flower sit­u­a­tion, some pro­tein bars and some kom­bucha that I don’t re­ally need but sounds in­ter­est­ing”.</p>
    <p>But the l onger we speak, it be­comes ap­par­ent that the quips and youth­ful ex­u­ber­ance hide a wis­dom far be­yond her years – a self­pos­ses­sion that comes, per­haps, from hav­ing grown up on the set of an Emmy-win­ning show and be­ing sur­rounded by adults work­ing at the top of their pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>That was cer­tainly where she forged the dis­tinc­tive, retro-cool sense of style she is known for on the red car­pet and in de­signer cam­paigns such as the Ro­man Hol­i­dayesque one she did for Fendi’s Baguette purse last year.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I grew up on Mad Men, which is such a fash­ion-cen­tric show, I would go in for fit­tings when I was six or seven years old, and they would have pho­tos on the wall of all sorts of beau­ti­ful-look­ing fash­ion, and I’d be see­ing all these gor­geous dresses all the time. That was my child­hood love of fash­ion be­ing born on that show,” says the star, who cites Grace Kelly and Au­drey Hep­burn as her spirit an­i­mals style-wise.</p>
    <p>“I also learnt on that show that style can tell a story,” she adds. “It can be much more than just a pretty frock; it can be send­ing out some kind of mes­sage, how­ever big or small. That’s when I started get­ting in­ter­ested in fash­ion. Over time, I had the op­por­tu­nity to go to events and wear a lot of dif­fer­ent stuff, so it was kind of my world, whether I liked it or not. And I liked it.”</p>
    <p>Yet, Shipka’s ethos when it comes to fash­ion is any­thing but pre­cious. “I don’t think my style phi­los­o­phy is re­ally any­thing more than just ‘have fun’,” she quips.</p>
    <p>“I’ll go through dif­fer­ent phases of want­ing to look su­per fash­ion­able, clas­sic, edgy, bold, but I think there should al­ways be a play­ful­ness – for me at least. It’s a plat­form to just have fun and play and be bold, and maybe make a few ‘why did I wear that?’ mo­ments. I get it if you want to look phe­nom­e­nal in a gor­geous black dress at ev­ery sin­gle event, but for me, it’s about be­ing fun and be­ing a lit­tle ex­tra, if you will.”</p>
    <p>Mad Men, she shares, left an in­deli­ble mark on her as an ac­tor too.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I never went to act­ing school,” she ex­plains. “I was told very ex­plic­itly to not get act­ing lessons, par­tially be­cause the show was so top se­cret, and also be­cause when you’re a child, you have such a beau­ti­ful nat­u­ral in­stinct that shouldn’t be touched.</p>
    <p>“You’ve never been more un­in­hib­ited. So I didn’t have fears. I wasn’t won­der­ing what peo­ple were go­ing to think of my per­for­mance and I wasn’t scared. I was just moulded and shaped by the per­for­mances I saw around me – by Jon Hamm and Elis­a­beth Moss and Jan­uary Jones and John Slat­tery, so I had pretty good teach­ers. I look back on that and I’m just so grate­ful that’s the way in which my eyes were opened to the act­ing world.”</p>
    <p>On the set of Chill­ing Ad­ven­tures Of Sabrina, she is the one set­ting the ex­am­ple. Co-stars such as Mi­randa Otto and Lucy Davis, who play her witch aunts, have been glow­ing in their praise of Shipka’s pro­fes­sion­al­ism and the tone she sets as the first name on the call sheet.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress has learnt to lean into her power both be­hind and in front of the cam­era on this show. “When I started Sabrina,” she says, “I was 18. I’m 20 now and I feel like in those two years, I’ve grown so much and I’ve learnt so much about my work and act­ing.”</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ues can­didly: “I think there’s a ten­dency for women to not ask for what they need for fear of be­ing seen as too bossy or too this or too that. But I’ve learned that ask­ing for what you need is not only go­ing to make you bet­ter, it’s go­ing to make the en­tire pro­duc­tion bet­ter if it’s some­thing that is nec­es­sary.”</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, I want to be easy and fun to work with,” she con­cedes. “And that is still 100 per cent pos­si­ble while also be­ing au­thor­i­ta­tive, know­ing your worth and know­ing ex­actly what you need to give the best pos­si­ble per­for­mance. That can be 100 per cent main­tained while also be­ing kind and pre­sent and friendly, and that’s the big­gest les­son I’ve learnt. You can be a boss while also be­ing pleas­ant and lovely. Step­ping into my power on that front has been re­ally em­pow­er­ing.”</p>
    <p>And like other prom­i­nent young peo­ple, she is ready to step out and be heard, if nec­es­sary, on the big­ger world stage.</p>
    <p>“I can’t think of a bet­ter way to fight in­jus­tices or any sort of sys­tem that doesn’t feel right,” she says.</p>
    <p>And with the ris­ing promi­nence of youth ac­tivists such as Greta Thun­berg and the Park­land teens lead­ing the charge on cli­mate change and gun con­trol re­spec­tively, Shipka be­lieves her gen­er­a­tion is be­ing lis­tened to like never be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Young peo­ple are be­ing taken much more se­ri­ously than they ever have been,” she says. “And that’s a great thing. We’re the fu­ture, so it makes sense to lis­ten to and work with and col­lab­o­rate with us. The fact that we’re be­ing lis­tened to and tak­ing charge, a lot of it is pos­si­ble be­cause the age of so­cial me­dia makes it easy to get mes­sages across and find peo­ple who think the same.”</p>
    <p>Shipka has very clear ideas about what she does and does not want to use her celebrity and so­cial-me­dia plat­form for (she has 7.1 mil­lion In­sta­gram fol­low­ers). “I’ve been su­per in­spired by the peo­ple around me who are tak­ing stands on re­ally im­por­tant things,” she says.</p>
    <p>“For me, it’s re­ally about want­ing to be a good role model, es­pe­cially to young peo­ple, young women grow­ing up. I want to try and not por­tray some kind of pic­tureper­fect, ‘every­thing’s great’ sort of pic­ture. We all have our strug­gles and I never want to give out this high­light reel that is unattain­able.</p>
    <p>“For me, it’s im­por­tant to be trans­par­ent; In­sta­gram can be a com­par­i­son trap and I try to not per­pet­u­ate it fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar phi­los­o­phy is ev­i­denced by her choice of roles, which have tended to­wards char­ac­ters that are com­pli­cated, con­tra­dic­tory and fem­i­nist in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>“It’s sort of a nat­u­ral grav­i­ta­tion to­wards com­plex­ity,” ex­plains the star, who will head­line the up­com­ing com­edy se­ries Swim­ming With Sharks, a satire of the movie in­dus­try that will air on the new mo­bile video plat­form Quibi.</p>
    <p>“I’m not look­ing to play only good peo­ple or he­roes. As long as a char­ac­ter has depth, then I have a way in – a way to make that char­ac­ter sing and be truth­ful.”</p>
    <p>“That doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily mean they have to be a role model of a char­ac­ter,” she fur­ther clar­i­fies. “That would be very lim­it­ing. But I do want to find char­ac­ters that have tones to them and lay­ers, be­cause that’s a per­son.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing of lim­its, it seems Shipka has none. Like many other per­form­ers her age, she has a bunch of tal­ents be­sides act­ing.</p>
    <p>Sabrina fans will know she of­ten sings on the show; it turns out she also writes songs as well as plays the gui­tar and pi­ano.</p>
    <p>Could this be­come a side hus­tle or al­ter­na­tive ca­reer down the road? “I would love that,” says Shipka, who de­scribes her com­po­si­tions as “Pitch­fork-y mu­sic” – a ref­er­ence to the al­ter­na­tive-mu­sic fes­ti­val in Chicago.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if I want to put my mu­sic out in the world just yet, but it’s def­i­nitely some­thing I en­joy, and I might ex­plore that av­enue in my life at some point.”</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, there is karaoke. The star is known to be a bit of a fiend on that front, of­ten round­ing up her Sabrina cast­mates for en­thu­si­as­tic sin­ga­longs in Vancouver, where the show is filmed.</p>
    <p>She gamely goes down a rab­bit hole when asked what her go-to karaoke songs are these days. “I go to (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s) Shal­low when I have some­one to do a duet with me and it’s a re­ally ro­man­tic mo­ment,” says Shipka, who is re­port­edly dat­ing film-maker Chris­tian Cop­pola, 26.</p>
    <p>“Every­time by Brit­ney Spears when you want a hard-hit­ting bal­lad; A Thou­sand Miles by Vanessa Carl­ton if you’ve al­ready done a cou­ple of high-en­ergy ones and you kind of want to keep the en­ergy but do some­thing that’s also a bit sappy; and Last Dance by Donna Sum­mer or Proud Mary by Tina Turner for ab­so­lute bring-down­the-house mo­ments.”</p>
    <p>And just when you think these are noth­ing more than play­ful mus­ings, Shipka slips in another nugget of wis­dom. “I think you can’t play it safe when it comes to karaoke: Any song that you’re com­fort­able sing­ing is not a good op­tion. That is the rule of thumb – if you feel like, ‘Oh, I got this 100 per cent’, think again. Dream big­ger.”</p>
    <p>Not a bad rule for life ei­ther.</p>
