    <p>Back in 2016, mu­si­cian and for­mer na­tional ath­lete Eileen Chai’s life was at a low point.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of my men­tal health con­di­tion, I’ve lost per­form­ing and speak­ing en­gage­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, I’ve hurt my friends emo­tion­ally, I’ve made my life dif­fi­cult and lost con­fi­dence as a mu­si­cian with my poor self-es­teem,” the 42-yearold vi­o­lin teacher says.</p>
    <p>To­day, she is in a much bet­ter place af­ter hav­ing sought pro­fes­sional help for so­cial per­form­ing anx­i­ety, a men­tal dis­or­der, and is us­ing her mu­sic to get oth­ers who are in a sim­i­lar po­si­tion to do the same.</p>
    <p>Chai, who is a for­mer na­tional gym­nast, track ath­lete and diver, is among the home-grown artists who have re­cently put out mu­sic that broaches the pre­vi­ously taboo sub­ject of men­tal health. And the songs can have a pos­i­tive and re­ward­ing ef­fect on both the lis­tener and artist.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, she and her hus­band Ben Kra­nen formed 3am Mu­sic Col­lec­tive, a group of lo­cal musicians who want to push for aware­ness and ac­cep­tance of men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Eu­gene Yip from a cap­pella group MICap­pella, who had grap­pled with so­cial anx­i­ety and clin­i­cal de­pres­sion; pop-rock duo Jack & Rai; cel­list Les­lie Tan and vi­o­lin­ist Ng Yu-Ying from the T’ang Quar­tet; singer-song­writer Kevin Mathews; for­mer Sin­ga­pore Idol con­tes­tant Bev­erly Mo­rata and Chai’s brother, gui­tarist Daniel.</p>
    <p>Last month, 3am re­leased a self­ti­tled album com­pris­ing 10 songs, each writ­ten and per­formed by dif­fer­ent artists, but linked by Chai’s vi­o­lin play­ing.</p>
    <p>She says: “The con­cept was a song cy­cle – an emo­tional jour­ney through 10 mu­sic tracks, start­ing from a happy life at the be­gin­ning, then when things go south, a drop into the dark­ness of the mind, with neg­a­tive thoughts about self­es­teem, wan­der­ing, anger all the way to the epiphany of know­ing there is a way out, that there are oth­ers who can help. These can be friends, loved ones and even pro­fes­sion­als.”</p>
    <p>In col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice, the songs were per­formed at an on­line con­cert that was part of the Be­yond The La­bel Fest, a vir­tual fes­ti­val that sup­ports men­tal well­ness. The con­cert is still avail­able on Be­yond The La­bel’s Face­book page (www.face­book.com/be­yondthe­la­belsg).</p>
    <p>Be­ing open about her men­tal health does have its down­side, says Chai.</p>
    <p>“When I started to tell more peo­ple about it, that was when I felt the so­cial stigma and lost a num­ber of friends. But I’m very blessed to know that there are still a lot of friends out there who love one an­other, so I trea­sure them dearly.”</p>
    <p>Songs about life ex­pe­ri­ences such as men­tal health woes can con­nect with peo­ple and this helps raise aware­ness of such is­sues, says Dr Alex Su, vice-chair­man of the med­i­cal board (clin­i­cal qual­ity) at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Many pa­tients with anx­i­ety dis­or­der, ma­jor de­pres­sion and even schizophre­nia have re­sponded well to mu­sic – they de­scribed that the mu­sic calms them and helps with their emo­tions. Some re­sponded very well to the pos­i­tive mes­sages in the lyrics as well.</p>
    <p>“There is a whole treat­ment modal­ity of mu­sic ther­apy that taps the power of mu­sic to help in­di­vid­u­als strug­gling with men­tal health is­sues.”</p>
    <p>He ad­vises artists and mu­sic fans who sus­pect that they might have men­tal health is­sues to con­sult a doc­tor who can as­sess and re­fer them to ap­pro­pri­ate help re­sources.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, singer-song­writer Jaye Foo, 28, whose songs clock mil­lions of streams on Spo­tify and YouTube, re­leased a sin­gle and in­ter­ac­tive mu­sic video, ADHD, un­der the moniker Jaye.</p>
    <p>Like his pre­vi­ous tracks To­mor­row and De­javu, the song is based on his strug­gles with men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways felt like an out­cast”, he says. “I’ve also ques­tioned the pur­pose of life many times ever since I was a teenager. Hav­ing gone through de­pres­sion sev­eral times in life, I re­ally want peo­ple to be kinder to one an­other.”</p>
    <p>To­mor­row touches on an­he­do­nia, the in­abil­ity to ex­pe­ri­ence hap­pi­ness; De­javu ex­plores top­ics such as love, trans­for­ma­tion, loss and fear; while ADHD broaches hy­per­ac­tiv­ity, es­capism, intoxicati­on and de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>He says: “I want peo­ple to know that hav­ing a cre­ative out­let can change your life for the bet­ter, as it has done for mine. Mu­sic has been my ther­apy and will al­ways be my ther­apy for the rest of my life.”</p>
    <p>Foo has do­nated pro­ceeds from the songs’ mer­chan­dise sales to</p>
    <p>Sa­mar­i­tans of Sin­ga­pore, the Alzheimer’s Dis­ease As­so­ci­a­tion and Spark, an ADHD (at­ten­tion deficit hy­per­ac­tiv­ity dis­or­der) non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion. He also re­cently spoke at an on­line event by The Calm Col­lec­tive, a group that pro­motes di­a­logue on men­tal health.</p>
    <p>For in­die al­ter­na­tive act Chas­ing Day­light, the re­lease of their new sin­gle, You Are The Song, last month was a chance to gen­er­ate con­ver­sa­tions about the topic in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The sin­gle was ac­com­pa­nied by a video in­ter­view se­ries, Sto­ries Of Mod­ern Anx­i­ety, in which the band dis­cuss the topic of anx­i­ety with rep­re­sen­ta­tives from so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions SOS, The Tapestry Project and the PleaseS­tay. Move­ment.</p>
    <p>Front­man Yap Wei Chi­ang, 29, says: “As a band, we’ve al­ways set out to write per­sonal songs. How­ever, we’ve known from the get-go that the band have to be a ve­hi­cle for some­thing big­ger than our­selves.</p>
    <p>“You Are The Song was a song I wrote about my own ex­pe­ri­ence and long-time strug­gle with per­for­mance anx­i­ety. As we were dis­cussing how to re­lease the sin­gle, we thought: ‘In­stead of just telling our story, why not use the op­por­tu­nity to lend our plat­form to more im­por­tant voices? What if we could share and con­nect with other peo­ple’s sto­ries of anx­i­ety?’”</p>
    <p>For met­al­core band Ver­dant, their de­but sin­gle re­leased ear­lier this year, Se­nes­cent, marks their strug­gles as they tran­si­tion into adult­hood and takes on top­ics such as anx­i­ety, grief and de­spair.</p>
    <p>Front­man Joshua Arthur, 27, says: “As a band, we wanted to ex­plore top­ics that were more ma­ture and started look­ing at the is­sues peo­ple our age face. We were over the whole teenage love and re­bel­lion phase and, af­ter brain­storm­ing, we wanted to tell sto­ries about be­ing hu­man.”</p>
    <p>Pop singer-song­writer Do­minic Chin says that men­tal health is less of a taboo sub­ject than it used to be. His de­but EP Li­cense To Cry in­cludes Alone, about how anx­i­ety dis­or­der has had a neg­a­tive ef­fect on his re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>“In this day and age when peo­ple are more ex­posed to so­cial me­dia, sta­tis­tics have shown that more peo­ple are get­ting de­pressed and anx­ious and, un­for­tu­nately, the sui­cide rate among youth is also at an all­time high, es­pe­cially in first-world coun­tries,” says the 25-year-old.</p>
    <p>“It would be detri­men­tal for peo­ple to not nor­malise talk­ing about our feel­ings in fear that we would be judged. Get­ting help when we need help is the first step to learning how to cope in this day and age, and that is why I write the songs that I do.”</p>
