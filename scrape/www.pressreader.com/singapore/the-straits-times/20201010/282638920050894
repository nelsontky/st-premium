    <p>Ma­jor Malaysian book fair The Big Bad Wolf Book Sale will be com­ing to Sin­ga­pore for the first time, al­beit vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>The flash sale – which car­ries more than 40,000 ti­tles and 20 mil­lion new books, in­clud­ing fic­tion, non-fic­tion and chil­dren’s books, at dis­counts of up to 90 per cent – will run from next Thurs­day to Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Founders and mar­ried couple An­drew Yap and Jac­que­line Ng said at a Zoom press con­fer­ence on Thurs­day that they had al­ways wanted to bring the sale to Sin­ga­pore, but got around to it only this year be­cause of high lo­gis­tics costs.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of their mis­sion to make books af­ford­able for all, they had also pri­ori­tised mov­ing into coun­tries with less ac­cess to books, such as Myan­mar or Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap, 43, said: “Be­cause of the pan­demic, we piv­oted to be­come an e-com­merce com­pany and one of the first coun­tries we thought of was Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Big Bad Wolf be­gan as a ware­house sale in Kuala Lumpur in 2009. It has since ex­panded to 10 other coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries – in­clud­ing In­done­sia, South Korea and Dubai – and held 33 events last year. It has also held on­line sales in Thai­land and Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap said there were teething prob­lems with web­site in­fras­truc­ture. “It’s like build­ing a car that you have no time to test-drive be­cause it’s a flash sale and we have to fix it as we go along. There were many chal­lenges, but none of them detri­men­tal.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides huge dis­counts, the sale also of­fers a flat ship­ping rate of $4.90. De­liv­ery is free for or­ders of $99 and above.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap and Ms Ng, who are Malaysian and Sin­ga­porean re­spec­tively, also founded the BookXcess book­store chain in Malaysia, known for the tow­er­ing walls of books at its Pe­nang and Jo­hor branches.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap hinted that they were in talks with OCBC Bank, their part­ner for the up­com­ing sale, to start a Sin­ga­pore out­let.</p>
    <p>“The book-sell­ing business has to­tally changed,” he said. “You see stand­alone book­stores down­siz­ing or clos­ing. We need help – we can’t do it alone.</p>
    <p>“The Big Bad Wolf sale here will be a good gauge of the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket. We are prepar­ing our­selves to be in Sin­ga­pore – we’re not sure when, but we will be.”</p>
