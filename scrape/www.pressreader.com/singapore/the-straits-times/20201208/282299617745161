    <p>Job seek­ers can look for­ward to bet­ter hir­ing prospects in the new year, with a sur­vey to­day re­veal­ing that one in five Sin­ga­pore em­ploy­ers ex­pects to in­crease re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>Around 20 per cent are likely to hire more staff in the first three months of next year than in the cur­rent quar­ter, said the em­ploy­ment out­look sur­vey re­leased by re­cruit­ment agency Man­pow­erGroup.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 66 per cent said they an­tic­i­pate no change to their head­counts, while 4 per cent said they ex­pect a de­crease in to­tal em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the net em­ploy­ment out­look is a 15 per cent in­crease – a 17 per­cent­age point rise from the last quar­ter and the strong­est out­look recorded for Sin­ga­pore in six years by the quar­terly sur­vey. Com­pared with the six other Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries where the same sur­vey was con­ducted, Sin­ga­pore recorded the sec­ond-strong­est net em­ploy­ment out­look af­ter Tai­wan (plus 23 per cent).</p>
    <p>Hong Kong had the poor­est out­look (mi­nus 2 per cent), while China, Ja­pan and In­dia recorded pos­i­tive net em­ploy­ment out­looks be­tween 5 per cent and 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>The net em­ploy­ment out­look is cal­cu­lated by sub­tract­ing the per­cent­age of em­ploy­ers who ex­pect to see a de­crease in em­ploy­ment from the per­cent­age of em­ploy­ers who an­tic­i­pate an in­crease in to­tal em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s strong em­ploy­ment out­look re­cov­ery re­flects em­ploy­ers’ grow­ing con­fi­dence now that the out­break is un­der con­trol here, said Man­pow­erGroup Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager Linda Teo.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the re­turn to pre-pan­demic hir­ing lev­els will be grad­ual as em­ploy­ers con­tinue to keep their plans fluid in an­tic­i­pa­tion of new de­vel­op­ments to the Covid-19 cri­sis. At the same time, em­ploy­ers are re­cal­i­brat­ing their work­force strat­egy in view of tight­en­ing re­stric­tions on work pass ap­pli­ca­tions as well as the in­creased dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of work.” Hir­ing out­look was pos­i­tive in all seven sec­tors sur­veyed, but strong­est in min­ing and con­struc­tion, the ser­vice sec­tor, as well as trans­porta­tion and util­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo said this re­flects the changes in con­sumer be­hav­iour as a re­sult of Covid-19, where more peo­ple are shop­ping on­line and com­pa­nies have ex­panded to ecom­merce. “To meet th­ese in­creased de­mands, lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies are ramp­ing up their hir­ing to fill business, com­mer­cial, tech­nol­ogy and op­er­a­tional roles.”</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also asked em­ploy­ers when they ex­pect hir­ing ac­tiv­ity to re­cover to pre-Covid-19 lev­els, with 39 per cent say­ing they are un­cer­tain. Nine­teen per cent be­lieve it will never re­cover, while 17 per cent es­ti­mated it would take more than a year for hir­ing ac­tiv­ity to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>Twelve per cent ex­pect it to hap­pen within the next three months, while 9 per cent said it would take four to nine months. Only 4 per cent be­lieved it would re­cover within 10 to 12 months.</p>
