    <p>Not su­ing his sib­lings over state­ments they made re­gard­ing their 38 Ox­ley Road fam­ily home did not mean “carte blanche” for any­one else to use what they had said to de­fame him, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was tes­ti­fy­ing on day one of a week-long hear­ing on his li­bel suit against Mr Terry Xu, ed­i­tor of The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) web­site.</p>
    <p>The suit in­volves a TOC ar­ti­cle pub­lished in Au­gust last year, ti­tled “PM Lee’s wife, Ho Ching weirdly shares ar­ti­cle on cut­ting ties with fam­ily mem­bers”. The piece ref­er­enced a Face­book post made by PM Lee’s sis­ter, Dr Lee Wei Ling, in which she claimed he had mis­led their late fa­ther and found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew into think­ing 38 Ox­ley Road had been gazetted by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The TOC ar­ti­cle con­tained “sen­sa­tional” al­le­ga­tions that gravely in­jured PM Lee’s char­ac­ter and rep­u­ta­tion, his lawyers have said.</p>
    <p>In his cross-ex­am­i­na­tion, Mr Xu’s lawyer Lim Tean said that since PM Lee had cho­sen not to sue his sib­lings over their al­le­ga­tions, it was “un­der­stand­able” that the TOC ed­i­tor thought he could re­fer to what they had said.</p>
    <p>Dis­agree­ing, PM Lee said: “On the al­le­ga­tions made by my sib­lings, I had de­cided to take a dif­fer­ent ap­proach with them and it did not mean carte blanche for any­body else to use that to spread those al­le­ga­tions and fur­ther de­fame me.</p>
    <p>“I am not obliged to sue every­body in or­der to sue one per­son. I talked to my coun­sel and made the de­ci­sion whom to sue.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then asked: “Are you sug­gest­ing to Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans that the me­dia can never re­port on what your sib­lings have ac­cused you of, when it is a mat­ter of in­tense pub­lic in­ter­est?”</p>
    <p>PM Lee said they could, sub­ject to defama­tion laws.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim asked if this meant re­port­ing on his side of the story only.</p>
    <p>“Not at all,” PM Lee re­sponded. “They can re­port what they think needs to come out and if I sue them for defama­tion and I am wrong, they can go to court, vin­di­cate them­selves and de­mol­ish me – which is what I be­lieve you are hop­ing to do in this trial.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that Mr Xu had re­peated al­le­ga­tions he had pre­vi­ously re­but­ted, in an ar­ti­cle that gar­nered more than 100,000 views. Those who have not fol­lowed the case and its de­tails would be­lieve what was writ­ten, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim asked: “Your sib­lings have been mak­ing charges against you since 2017… so you are con­tent to let your sib­lings butcher your rep­u­ta­tion?”</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he had dealt with their ac­cu­sa­tions in two min­is­te­rial state­ments in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He added that he had also re­pub­lished his min­is­te­rial state­ments out­side Par­lia­ment, thereby waiv­ing his par­lia­men­tary priv­i­lege. This would al­low his sib­lings to sue him over the state­ments, but they have not done so, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>“As far as the pub­lic is con­cerned, my not su­ing my sib­lings does not mean I con­done (the al­le­ga­tions) or that their state­ments are nec­es­sar­ily true,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“But if others re­peat it and I don’t act against others for which my in­hi­bi­tions against su­ing sib­lings do not ap­ply, that would fur­ther spread the poi­son and ag­gra­vate the dam­age.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then asked PM Lee if he had read the Face­book post made by Ms Ho, which was the sub­ject of the TOC ar­ti­cle’s head­line.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho had shared a link to an ar­ti­cle called “Here’s why some­times it is okay to cut ties with toxic fam­ily mem­bers”.</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing, PM Lee said he did not. He added it was un­nec­es­sary for him to have read the Face­book post by his wife, and that it was ir­rel­e­vant to the parts of the ar­ti­cle that were al­legedly defam­a­tory.</p>
    <p>“My wife’s post­ing was just a peg for TOC to pick at me,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said he found PM Lee’s ac­count that he had not read the post “in­cred­i­ble” and “so amaz­ing, it must be false”.</p>
    <p>He also ar­gued that given the back­ground and con­text of the dis­pute, any­one read­ing Ms Ho’s post would have drawn the in­fer­ence that it was a com­men­tary on the sib­lings’ Ox­ley Road feud. PM Lee dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>“There are many ar­ti­cles my wife of­ten reads and shares,” he said. “She shares posts about all sorts of things... she has wide in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee added that many peo­ple would have read Ms Ho’s post with­out “im­put­ing evil mo­tive”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim sug­gested that it was only nat­u­ral and rea­son­able for a jour­nal­ist like Mr Xu to want to com­ment on Ms Ho’s post.</p>
    <p>“That would be en­tirely in or­der had he not de­famed me in the process,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>‘EX­CEP­TIONAL FOR­BEAR­ANCE’ IN IS­SU­ING LETTER VIA PMO</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he was hop­ing to avoid a law­suit when he de­cided to send a letter to Mr Xu through his press sec­re­tary in­stead of his lawyers. He also re­jected a sug­ges­tion by Mr Lim that he was try­ing to in­tim­i­date Mr Xu into re­mov­ing an ar­ti­cle and Face­book post by us­ing the sta­tus of the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice (PMO).</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he had ex­er­cised “ex­cep­tional for­bear­ance” in is­su­ing the letter, as he would have sent a for­mal letter of de­mand in any other case.</p>
    <p>“I would have de­manded dam­ages, apolo­gies, un­der­tak­ings… but I was hop­ing to avoid an­other big flare-up and a re­gur­gi­ta­tion and re­hash­ing of all the is­sues which had made Sin­ga­pore so un­happy in 2017,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>In send­ing the letter via his of­fice, he thought “per­haps TOC and Mr Xu would get the mes­sage and would be pre­pared, in the na­tional in­ter­est, to do the right thing and apol­o­gise to me, take down the post and close the mat­ter. Un­for­tu­nately, it was not to be”.</p>
    <p>On Sept 1 last year, PM Lee’s press sec­re­tary sent Mr Xu a letter ask­ing him to take the ar­ti­cle down and is­sue a “full and un­con­di­tional apol­ogy”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee sued for li­bel af­ter Mr Xu re­fused to do so.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also noted that PM Lee had pub­li­cised the letter by his press sec­re­tary to the main­stream me­dia al­most im­me­di­ately af­ter it was sent to Mr Xu, and there­fore “did not give (Mr Xu) an op­por­tu­nity to re­spond”.</p>
    <p>This did not pre­clude Mr Xu from re­spond­ing, PM Lee replied.</p>
    <p>“Mr Terry Xu had pub­lished his ar­ti­cle, it was gain­ing many eye­balls. It had 100,000 views, mostly in those two months, Au­gust and Septem­ber. It was im­por­tant for me to tell the world that it was un­true and I had asked for it to be taken down,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said: “I sug­gest to you, Mr Lee, that your ac­tions in­di­cate a man who was out to in­tim­i­date.”</p>
    <p>To this, PM Lee re­sponded: “I don’t solve th­ese prob­lems by in­tim­i­dat­ing peo­ple. I solve them by con­sult­ing coun­sel and ex­er­cis­ing my le­gal rights. In­tim­i­da­tion gets you nowhere. If you in­tim­i­date some­body with­out jus­ti­fi­ca­tion and it goes to court, you will get a black eye.”</p>
