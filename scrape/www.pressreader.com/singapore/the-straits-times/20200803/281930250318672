    <p>Hun­dreds of thou­sands of un­der­grad­u­ates in Amer­ica won’t be al­lowed on their cam­puses this au­tumn, or the cam­puses wel­com­ing them will be hol­lowed out, locked down, rev­elry leeched shad­ows of their for­mer selves.</p>
    <p>What kind of col­lege ex­pe­ri­ence is that?</p>
    <p>The kind that Ms Natalie Kan­ter had by de­sign. She did col­lege with­out the cam­pus – four de­mand­ing and ex­hil­a­rat­ing years of it.</p>
    <p>And I don’t mean that she lived off cam­pus, com­mut­ing in as needed.</p>
    <p>There was no cam­pus to com­mute to. No lec­ture halls. No recre­ation cen­tre. No foot­ball sta­dium.</p>
    <p>For her and her school­mates, re­mote learn­ing wasn’t a cri­sis-prompted com­pro­mise. It was the whole point.</p>
    <p>Ms Kan­ter, 23, be­longed to the first grad­u­at­ing class of a sort of start-up col­lege, Min­erva, which opened about five years ago. All of its in­struc­tion is on­line, from pro­fes­sors scat­tered far and wide.</p>
    <p>And while stu­dents in a given grade live to­gether in a res­i­den­tial build­ing so that they have peers at hand and a cen­tre of grav­ity, they do so all around the globe, mov­ing pe­ri­od­i­cally to a new city that be­comes their new cam­pus, but only tem­po­rar­ily.</p>
    <p>Ms Kan­ter and her roughly 105 class­mates spent their first two semesters in San Fran­cisco, where Min­erva’s bare-bones ad­min­is­tra­tion is, be­fore mi­grat­ing for one se­mes­ter each to Ber­lin; Buenos Aires, Ar­gentina; Seoul, South Korea; Hyderabad, In­dia; Lon­don; and then San Fran­cisco again. Min­erva has a foot­print – well, more a toe dim­ple – in each of those places, plus Taipei, Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>It’s de­fined not by phys­i­cal struc­tures but by a pro­pri­etary, highly in­ter­ac­tive dig­i­tal plat­form that pro­fes­sors use for their sem­i­nars. The sem­i­nars are capped at 20 stu­dents (but are usu­ally smaller) and em­pha­sise par­tic­i­pa­tion to a point where the plat­form – a far cry from Zoom – shows a pro­fes­sor how long he or she has been dron­ing on.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing a cam­pus is one of the least im­por­tant parts of the univer­sity ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Ms Kan­ter, who grad­u­ated in May last year and now works for so­cial ad­vo­cacy or­gan­i­sa­tion DoSome­thing.org.</p>
    <p>Yes, she said, the “ad­di­tional piz­zazz” of grand build­ings, weath­ered stat­ues and “rub­bing the left foot of this or jump­ing into that foun­tain when you grad­u­ate” might have been nice. But nec­es­sary? Not for learn­ing. Not for ex­tra-cur­ric­u­lar en­rich­ment, to which a cam­pus can some­times be a clois­ter­ing, cod­dling bar­rier.</p>
    <p>A cam­pus also in­flates the cost of col­lege. Tu­ition, fees, and room and board at Min­erva are about US$32,000 (S$44,000) a year – eas­ily half the sticker price of many pres­ti­gious pri­vate col­leges – for stu­dents pay­ing full freight, which is only about 20 per cent of them.</p>
    <p>That’s made pos­si­ble by the ab­sence of gleam­ing cam­pus struc­tures.</p>
    <p>For­mer se­na­tor and Min­erva board mem­ber Bob Ker­rey told me that the im­por­tance of a snazzy or tra­di­tional set­ting is a false­hood “set up by peo­ple who re­ally don’t want to lose the in­vest­ment in class­rooms”.</p>
    <p>“I’m part of it,” he added, re­fer­ring to the 16-storey, roughly US$350 mil­lion Univer­sity Cen­tre that he helped to cre­ate when he was pres­i­dent of the New School in Man­hat­tan from 2001 to 2010.</p>
    <p>“It’s lovely. The stu­dents love it. But it’s built for the old way of do­ing things. Once you’ve made the in­vest­ment, it’s not easy to let it go.”</p>
    <p>Min­erva drew at­ten­tion at the out­set be­cause it was one an­swer to in­ten­si­fy­ing ques­tions about the af­ford­abil­ity of col­lege, the coun­try club ex­cesses of some cam­puses and the er­ratic de­vo­tion to ac­tual in­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>But it’s an ob­ject of even greater fas­ci­na­tion now be­cause it willingly made changes that other schools are sud­denly forced to con­sider, thanks to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Stan­ford as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of ed­u­ca­tion Mitchell Steven told me that even be­fore the pan­demic, higher ed­u­ca­tion “was in many ways be­ing held to­gether by prayers, Band-Aids, in­ter­na­tional stu­dents and a lot of debt”.</p>
    <p>“What the pan­demic cre­ates,” he said, “is a kind of ex­is­ten­tial chal­lenge to so many col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties and busi­ness-model pre­sump­tions. That’s an op­por­tu­nity for fairly rad­i­cal re­think­ing.”</p>
    <p>Min­erva’s re­think­ing isn’t the so­lu­tion. For many stu­dents, Min­erva would be a dis­as­trous psy­cho­log­i­cal or prac­ti­cal fit.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers have obli­ga­tions or lim­i­ta­tions that for­bid globe-trot­ting.</p>
    <p>Its course cat­a­logue is a haiku next to a con­ven­tional univer­sity’s epic poem. It doesn’t own and give stu­dents in­stant ac­cess to cut­ting-edge sci­en­tific equip­ment or stacks of old books. But it’s a cre­ative mix of dis­rup­tions and re­bel­lions that could, in some form, have ap­pli­ca­tion else­where.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it com­pletely bucks the trend at many schools to­wards a dizzy­ing ar­ray of clubs, ac­tiv­i­ties and ameni­ties. Min­erva founder Ben Nel­son ar­gues that those are of­ten a dis­trac­tion from aca­demic pur­suits and that stu­dents who want to per­form mu­sic or play soc­cer with one an­other can ar­range that for them­selves, for­ag­ing for re­sources in the di­verse, teem­ing city around them.</p>
    <p>“The rich­ness that stu­dents can get by be­ing independen­t, by fig­ur­ing out how to nav­i­gate a place, is in­fin­itely bet­ter for their per­sonal de­vel­op­ment than the glee club hav­ing a room in the stu­dent cen­tre,” he said. “They’re en­tre­pre­neur­ial. They can lever­age what hap­pens in the real world.”</p>
    <p>That they use kitchens in their res­i­den­tial build­ings to cook for them­selves rather than plop­ping down in a stu­dent cafe­te­ria isn’t a hard­ship, he added.</p>
    <p>It’s, well, an ed­u­ca­tion. Mr Nel­son, of course, has an in­vest­ment in believ­ing that. But he’s hardly the first per­son to sug­gest that the coun­try’s richer schools are more con­cerned with pleas­ing stu­dents than with chal­leng­ing them and are bet­ter at de­lay­ing adult­hood than at ush­er­ing their charges into it.</p>
    <p>And Min­erva stu­dents and grad­u­ates I spoke to said the school in­deed gave them some­thing – ma­tu­rity, ini­tia­tive, in­ge­nu­ity and, ul­ti­mately, con­fi­dence – in re­turn for what they sac­ri­ficed.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der Sanchez, who left Washington Univer­sity in St. Louis af­ter one year to do Min­erva from start to fin­ish, told me that he “lost ac­cess to a dance stu­dio and to the crit­i­cal mass of stu­dents I would need to form a dance club”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Sanchez, 23, who grad­u­ated this year and works in the psy­chol­ogy depart­ment at Har­vard, told me that he learnt the tango in Buenos Aires, stud­ied hip-hop in Ber­lin and de­vel­oped “friend­ships that chal­lenged my con­cep­tions of what ‘nor­mal’ was every sin­gle day”.</p>
    <p>“We were ex­posed to such a di­ver­sity of opin­ions and cul­tural up­bring­ings,” he said, re­fer­ring to him­self and his Min­erva class­mates, most of whom aren’t from Amer­ica. Mr Sanchez is Colom­bian Amer­i­can and went to high school in Puerto Rico.</p>
    <p>Min­erva is an an­ti­dote to provin­cial­ism.</p>
    <p>Ms Me­gan Per­pich, 21, who will head to Ber­lin this au­tumn to be­gin her ju­nior year, told me that the school made her feel “small”. That’s a com­pli­ment. She feels small, she ex­plained, be­cause the world feels so very in­ex­haustibly big.</p>
    <p>And Min­erva has care­fully con­sid­ered and tried to ad­dress the pit­falls of on­line ed­u­ca­tion. One rea­son that some­one tak­ing a large lec­ture course alone on a com­puter at home may not fin­ish or glean much from it is the ab­sence of a nearby sup­port net­work of peers.</p>
    <p>But Min­erva stu­dents have one an­other for coun­sel, com­pany and com­mu­nity, and sev­eral told me that a class­mate tak­ing the same sem­i­nar that you are might be do­ing so on a lap­top set up next to yours. There might be three or four of you hud­dled to­gether, although not this com­ing se­mes­ter, when Min­erva will ex­hort stu­dents to ob­serve so­cial dis­tanc­ing in their res­i­dences.</p>
    <p>Those sem­i­nars all hap­pen live, and Min­erva’s dig­i­tal plat­form has in­ter­ac­tive facets that pre­vent stu­dents from doz­ing or drift­ing away. Their dis­tant pro­fes­sors hold of­fice hours – vir­tu­ally. And there are a few adults on hand in each Min­erva city to as­sist and check in on the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“But what,” I asked Ms Kan­ter, “about school spirit?”</p>
    <p>Does it sur­vive a re­liance on wire­less and air­ports?</p>
    <p>“It’s re-imag­ined,” she said. “It’s not sit­ting in bleach­ers and chant­ing.” It’s about be­ing in an un­con­ven­tional group of un­daunted ad­ven­tur­ers who are hav­ing an un­fa­mil­iar col­lege ex­pe­ri­ence, in part be­cause they’re fash­ion­ing it them­selves.</p>
    <p>“That def­i­nitely gives you an adren­a­line rush,” she said – a rush that may even be im­mune to a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Min­erva drew at­ten­tion at the out­set be­cause it was one an­swer to in­ten­si­fy­ing ques­tions about the af­ford­abil­ity of col­lege, the coun­try club ex­cesses of some cam­puses and the er­ratic de­vo­tion to ac­tual in­struc­tion. But it’s an ob­ject of even greater fas­ci­na­tion now be­cause it willingly made changes that other schools are sud­denly forced to con­sider, thanks to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
