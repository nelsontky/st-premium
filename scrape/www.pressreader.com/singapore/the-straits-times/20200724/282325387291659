    <p>ZYU SKIN­CARE</p>
    <p>The line, started by 23-year-old med­i­cal stu­dent Zoen Tay, fo­cuses on clean skin­care, made in col­lab­o­ra­tion with a lo­cal beauty spa founded by her par­ents in 1991.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay started her brand af­ter re­al­is­ing many of her peers knew very lit­tle about skin­care.</p>
    <p>She launched a sin­gle prod­uct – the An­tiox­i­dant Night Mask ($89) – last De­cem­ber. Her fi­ance, ac­tor Joshua Tan, 29, runs the brand with her.</p>
    <p>The prod­ucts are man­u­fac­tured here, with most in­gre­di­ents flown in from Ja­pan and Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>The Glow-It-Your­self Treat­ment Kit ($279), launched this month, is tai­lor-made for use at home, but with the same in­gre­di­ents a pro­fes­sional fa­cial­ist would use.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were cau­tious and kept their ex­pec­ta­tions low for the new brand, but de­spite the pan­demic, it has seen some suc­cess with more than 2,000 orders in the first six months. The en­dorse­ments from friends in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try do not hurt.</p>
    <p>“I started this busi­ness not want­ing to put too much into mar­ket­ing,” says Ms Tay, who plans to re­lease a sun­block next.</p>
    <p>“I learnt from my par­ents’ mar­ket­ing meth­ods, which was word-of- mouth. That way, peo­ple trust you.” Avail­able at: zyu.com.sg</p>
    <p>PSA SKIN</p>
    <p>The sis­ter brand to home-grown Al­lies of Skin (AOS) has been in the works for two years, says Sin­ga­porean founder Ni­co­las Travis, 32. The brand started re­search and de­vel­op­ment for the for­mu­las in 2018, fi­nally launch­ing just be­fore the global lock­downs in end-March.</p>
    <p>Con­cep­tu­alised as “a skin­care line for Gen Z”, PSA Skin – which stands for Pur­pose­ful Skin­care by Al­lies – taps AOS’ rep­u­ta­tion for sim­ple but ef­fec­tive for­mu­las mi­nus the heftier price tag.</p>
    <p>PSA Skin de­buted in Sephora Asia with four prod­ucts, which in­clude a bright­en­ing toner, Heroine ($45), that fea­tures man­delic and lac­tic acids; and Goals ($58), a blem­ish re­pair serum boast­ing a blend of acids and pro­bi­otics.</p>
    <p>Due to Covid-19-re­lated de­lays, the brand was un­able to de­but its full range of seven prod­ucts. But launch­ing PSA Skin has been “the best thing we’ve done”, says</p>
    <p>Mr Travis. “It al­lowed us to cap­ture and serve a dif­fer­ent cus­tomer base – a new, younger de­mo­graphic we didn’t have ac­cess to pre­vi­ously be­cause of AOS’ high price point. We’ve been very for­tu­nate to have been able to grow and ex­pand dur­ing this tough global cli­mate.”</p>
    <p>For now, mar­ket­ing ef­forts have been kept “very grass­roots”, with a fo­cus on so­cial me­dia con­tent and paid col­lab­o­ra­tions with global in­flu­encers to spread the word.</p>
    <p>“We’ll start our global pub­lic re­la­tions blitz once we launch with our other in­ter­na­tional re­tail­ers like The Hut Group in Bri­tain and the United States; and Cult Beauty and ASOS later this year.”</p>

    <p>JUNG BEAUTY</p>
    <p>A year in the mak­ing, Jung Beauty is Korean fash­ion and beauty e-tailer Ksis­ters’ first flag­ship brand, af­ter four years of cu­rat­ing and dis­tribut­ing in­die Korean brands.</p>
    <p>It de­buted last month with the 2 Step Steam­ing Hair Spa ($50 for five sheets), a two-step hair mask meant to recre­ate the sa­lon ex­pe­ri­ence of steam­ing and nour­ish­ing hair.</p>
    <p>When pop-ups in March were canned, the brand con­ducted a con­sumer test event in­stead.</p>
    <p>Sam­ples were sent to more than one hun­dred con­sumer testers who signed up to try the new prod­uct, and who were en­cour­aged to share their hon­est re­views.</p>
    <p>Founder Jung­min Lee, 33, says: “We re­ceived so much user-gen­er­ated con­tent and great ver­ba­tim feed­back about the prod­uct.”</p>
    <p>About 5,000 boxes were sold in the first four days of its launch.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee had con­sid­ered de­lay­ing the launch till next year, but felt now was “the right time”.</p>
    <p>Sa­lon trips might be a lux­ury for some and she could bring it af­ford­ably and safely to con­sumers’ homes in­stead.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dif­fi­cult and un­sta­ble time for ev­ery­one. We took into con­sid­er­a­tion the poor eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion and how this may af­fect con­sumers’ will­ing­ness to try new prod­ucts,” she says.</p>
    <p>“But we felt our prod­ucts would be ap­pre­ci­ated dur­ing this time for its con­ve­nience and com­fort, which may in turn help im­prove the stay-home ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Jung Beauty will even­tu­ally launch skin­care as well, with one to three new prod­ucts each year.</p>
