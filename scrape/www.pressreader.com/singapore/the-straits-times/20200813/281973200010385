    <p>In­done­sian crew mem­bers repa­tri­ated in May af­ter work­ing on a Chi­nese fish­ing ves­sel are still with­out pay, 18 months af­ter they first boarded the ill-fated Long Xing 629, in Bu­san, South Korea, for a twoyear con­tract.</p>
    <p>The con­tract was cut short in De­cem­ber as four work­ers started fall­ing ill and dy­ing af­ter com­plain­ing of se­vere swelling and breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, lawyers for six of 14 sur­viv­ing crew mem­bers repa­tri­ated from Bu­san said they had re­jected an of­fer from their re­cruit­ing agency PT Al­fira Per­dana Jaya to pay out a lit­tle more than half of their con­tract – US$4,300 (S$5,900).</p>
    <p>The other eight have been paid through their re­cruit­ing agen­cies, ac­cord­ing to the crew’s lawyer, Mr Pahrur Dal­imunthe, man­ag­ing part­ner of Jakarta firm DNT Lawyers.</p>
    <p>So far this year, 18 In­done­sian crew mem­bers have died on for­eign fish­ing ves­sels, ac­cord­ing to an of­fi­cial with In­done­sia’s for­eign min­istry.</p>
    <p>But the Long Xing 629 stands out for its many deaths that oc­curred out­side of a se­ri­ous ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Four died out of a 21-man In­done­sian crew. Three were dropped off on Samoa with plane tick­ets back to Jakarta and were not rep­re­sented in the law­suit.</p>
    <p>Videos taken of the burial at sea in March were widely shared in In­done­sia’s news out­lets. Three of the men were buried at sea. The re­mains of the fourth crew mem­ber were repa­tri­ated to In­done­sia from Bu­san where he had died shortly af­ter the crew had re­turned from sea in April.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia is press­ing China to make wit­nesses from Dalian Ocean Fish­ing Co, which owns the fish­ing ves­sel, avail­able for ques­tion­ing. The com­pany sells tuna and other deep-sea species to its do­mes­tic mar­ket and to Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian po­lice have charged six man­agers from the three agen­cies, in­clud­ing PT Al­fira that sup­plied crew to Dalian to work on the Long Xing 629 and other ships, with hu­man traf­fick­ing. The of­fence car­ries a max­i­mum sen­tence of 15 years in prison and fines of 600 mil­lion ru­piah (S$56,000).</p>
    <p>The dif­fi­culty in get­ting full pay­ment – roughly US$7,000 – from the re­cruit­ing agency un­der­scores the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties faced by work­ers on for­eign ves­sels which can spend months at sea far from cel­lu­lar ser­vice or con­sular pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>With no re­course to lawyers and of­ten des­per­ate for cash, re­turn­ing crew set­tle for par­tial pay­ments, said Mr Pahrur.</p>
    <p>Crew mem­bers of the Long Xing 629 in­ter­viewed by The Straits Times were con­tracted for monthly amounts of up to US$400 – triple what they could hope to earn at home, though a frac­tion of the value of their catch of yel­lowfin tuna and shark.</p>
    <p>On a sin­gle day, the Long Xing 629 would haul in about 500 tonnes of tuna – worth US$4,300 at mar­ket prices, ac­cord­ing to Mr Rizky Fauzan Al­vian, 27, a se­nior crew mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Crew mem­bers told The Straits Times they had re­ceived very lit­tle, or no, money while they were at sea. Mr Nur Adi­wi­jaya, 20, em­ployed by PT Al­fira, said he re­ceived only US$120 from his re­cruiter.</p>
    <p>The crew worked 18 hours a day, were fed ex­pired food, had only salty wa­ter to drink and were at times phys­i­cally at­tacked by the Chi­nese se­nior crew, the crew mem­bers said.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizky said: “I just obey and work and not think of run­ning away. I was afraid I wouldn’t get paid.”</p>
    <p>Dalian Ocean Fish­ing Co and PT Al­fira did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
