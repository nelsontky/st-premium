    <p>Fall­ing tem­per­a­tures, young asymp­to­matic spread­ers and small so­cial gath­er­ings where peo­ple tend to take off their masks are fu­elling South Korea’s lat­est surge in coro­n­avirus cases, viewed as the third ma­jor wave since Fe­bru­ary and pos­si­bly the tough­est to curb.</p>
    <p>The coun­try, which has suc­cess­fully used mas­sive test­ing and ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing to stem out­breaks with­out re­sort­ing to lock­downs, is now strug­gling to con­tain Covid-19 ahead of an al­limpor­tant col­lege en­trance exam due on Dec 3.</p>
    <p>What was once the worst-case sce­nario of 100 cases a day is now the new low bench­mark in a fivetier scheme in­tro­duced this month to re­flect more re­al­is­tic tar­gets as the fight against Covid-19 stretches into the long haul.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Choi Jae-wook of Korea Univer­sity’s Col­lege of Medicine pointed out that the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to com­mu­nity in­fec­tions that started in the JuneJuly pe­riod was in­ef­fec­tive to be­gin with, and that peo­ple be­came tired of so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“Now, it is im­pos­si­ble to keep the num­ber of con­firmed cases at 100 as in the past,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“The quar­an­tine pol­icy should be re-es­tab­lished on the premise there are 400 to 500 con­firmed cases, and quar­an­tine and treat­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties im­proved to en­able con­trol and man­age­ment.”</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 382 cases yes­ter­day – the high­est since Au­gust, when gath­er­ings at a church and a public rally trig­gered the sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>This brings the to­tal tally to 31,735, with a death toll of 513.</p>
    <p>Each pa­tient cur­rently in­fects 1.5</p>
    <p>peo­ple, but ex­perts fear this fig­ure will grow as win­ter ar­rives and peo­ple are con­fined in crammed in­door spa­ces where viruses thrive.</p>
    <p>South Korea has re­lied on mo­bile phone data, credit card records and closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage to track trans­mis­sions. But the new wave presents a chal­lenge as many small clus­ters are hap­pen­ing in vastly dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Since Tues­day, re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings have been tight­ened in Seoul and greater Seoul.</p>
    <p>Clubs and bars must close for two weeks, while karaoke rooms and in­door sports fa­cil­i­ties are al­lowed to op­er­ate only un­til 9pm.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures are aimed at curb­ing a grow­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions from small gath­er­ings in public places that con­trib­uted to the cur­rent spike.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said peo­ple tend to let their guard down and take off their masks at such gath­er­ings, al­low­ing the virus to spread more eas­ily.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures also tar­get young peo­ple. Pa­tients in their 20s ac­count for about 20 per cent of all in­fec­tions, up from 10 per cent two months ago and the high­est among the var­i­ous age groups.</p>
    <p>Dr Jung Eun-kyeong, chief of the Korea Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency, said they pose a higher risk of spread­ing the virus in the com­mu­nity as they of­ten show no or mild symp­toms, and con­tinue to lead ac­tive so­cial lives.</p>
    <p>Eas­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures be­fore the virus sit­u­a­tion had sta­bilised was also a mis­take, noted Dr Kim Woo-joo of Korea Univer­sity Guro Hos­pi­tal’s in­fec­tious disease depart­ment.</p>
    <p>A clus­ter in a club in May and one in a church i n Au­gust both emerged af­ter so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules were eased too quickly.</p>
    <p>“In the end, the gov­ern­ment will just be re­peat­ing the same mis­takes and continuing a vi­cious cir­cle,” said Dr Kim.</p>
    <p>“The les­son learnt is that only coun­tries that took pre-emp­tive and bold mea­sures suf­fered min­i­mal dam­age.”</p>
