    <p>Early birds look­ing to try Cal­i­for­nian start-up Eat Just’s Good Meat Cul­tured Chicken are i n for a unique ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>At an in­vited tast­ing yes­ter­day, mem­bers of the me­dia had a taste of cul­tured meat, which is made by cul­tur­ing an­i­mal cells in­stead of slaugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The l ab-grown meat will be of­fered at 1880, a pri­vate club in Robert­son Quay, to mem­bers from next month.</p>
    <p>This marks Eat Just’s first com­mer­cial sale for Good Meat since the meat was ap­proved for sale by the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency early this month.</p>
    <p>Only the last course of the four­course tast­ing menu at 1 880 fea­tures the bite-size cul­tured meat.</p>
    <p>In it, two dishes in­flu­enced by chicken-pro­duc­ing coun­tries are served side by side.</p>
    <p>The China-in­spired bao fea­tures sliced se­same cul­tured chicken, pick­led cu­cum­ber and spring onion, while the Amer­i­can­in­flu­enced maple waf­fle is served with a cul­tured chicken nugget and hot sauce.</p>
    <p>The bite-size chicken pieces in both dishes come with a crisp, bat­tered ex­te­rior and a slightly softer tex­ture than real chicken.</p>
    <p>Next month, the pair of cul­tured chicken dishes ($23 for both) will be avail­able to mem­bers of the 1880 club. The dishes will likely be made avail­able to the pub­lic later.</p>
    <p>They are pre­pared by 1880’s ex­ec­u­tive chef Colin Buchan, to­gether with Eat Just’s chef and prod­uct de­vel­oper Zachary Tyn­dall.</p>
    <p>In a Zoom in­ter­view, Eat Just’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Josh Tet­rick says the com­pany will likely re­tail the prod­uct in su­per­mar­kets by midto end-2022.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, it is look­ing to ex­pand to other restau­rants and “any­where sell­ing chicken”.</p>
    <p>He says the cur­rent nugget prod­uct is in its first phase. The next phase in the com­ing years will fea­ture what he calls “scaf­fold­ing” – the meat will have a more three­d­i­men­sional struc­ture with mus­cle and fat in­ter­lac­ing.</p>
    <p>There may be cul­tured chicken wings, com­plete with bones and car­ti­lage, in the third phase, he adds. Other prod­ucts in the pipe­line in­clude beef pat­ties and pork sausages.</p>
    <p>With plans to scale up pro­duc­tion, Mr Tet­rick is l ook­ing to ac­cel­er­ate the set-up of Eat Just’s pro­tein pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity here, but is un­sure whether the pro­duc­tion of Eat Just’s plant-based Just Egg will be in the same com­pound as those pro­duc­ing the other “meats”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Yeen Chern, a di­rec­tor at TL In­vest­ments, was one of the in­vited din­ers who tried the cul­tured chicken on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He says: “The nugget re­ally tasted like a nugget. If I close my eyes, I don’t think I can tell the dif­fer­ence be­tween the cell-based meat and real meat. I’ve tried other al­ter­na­tive beef be­fore – those are pretty con­vinc­ing too.”</p>
