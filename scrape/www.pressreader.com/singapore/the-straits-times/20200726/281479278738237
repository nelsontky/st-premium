    <p>Dick­son Yeo spent al­most five years work­ing at the be­hest of Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives to ob­tain valu­able in­for­ma­tion from the United States.</p>
    <p>He was re­cruited when, as a PhD stu­dent i n the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy, he went on a trip to Bei­jing to give a pre­sen­ta­tion on South-east Asia pol­i­tics, court doc­u­ments showed.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the pre­sen­ta­tion, he was ap­proached and re­cruited by in­di­vid­u­als who said they rep­re­sented China-based think-tanks and of­fered him money in ex­change for po­lit­i­cal re­ports and in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Yeo came to un­der­stand that at least four of them were Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives, one of whom even­tu­ally asked him to sign a con­tract with China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army.</p>
    <p>Although Yeo re­fused to sign the con­tract, he con­tin­ued to work for the Chi­nese op­er­a­tives.</p>
    <p>They told him that they wanted non-pub­lic in­for­ma­tion which they called “scut­tle­butt”, a slang term for ru­mours and gossip.</p>
    <p>Their as­sign­ments fo­cused on South-east Asia at first, but over time, shifted to fo­cus on the US.</p>
    <p>Over the next few years, Yeo met his Chi­nese han­dlers as many as 25 times in var­i­ous lo­ca­tions across China.</p>
    <p>When­ever he trav­elled to China for these meet­ings, he was reg­u­larly taken out of the Cus­toms line and brought to a sep­a­rate of­fice for ad­mis­sion into the coun­try, said the court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>When he brought this up with one of the op­er­a­tives, he was told that they wanted to con­ceal his iden­tity when he trav­elled into China.</p>
    <p>FROM RE­CRUITED TO RE­CRUITER</p>
    <p>Yeo’s modus operandi was to trawl a pro­fes­sional net­work­ing web­site for peo­ple with re­sumes and job de­scrip­tions sug­gest­ing that they could have ac­cess to the sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion the Chi­nese were look­ing for.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he con­tacted some po­ten­tial tar­gets, the web­site be­gan to sug­gest ad­di­tional po­ten­tial con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Yeo found the web­site’s al­go­rithm “re­lent­less”, check­ing al­most ev­ery day to re­view the fresh batches of po­ten­tial con­tacts.</p>
    <p>He told US law en­force­ment of­fi­cers it felt “al­most like an ad­dic­tion”, said the court papers.</p>
    <p>He looked out for sus­cep­ti­ble in­di­vid­u­als who were vul­ner­a­ble to re­cruit­ment, and tried to avoid de­tec­tion by the Amer­i­can au­thor­i­ties, the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion’s</p>
    <p>coun­ter­in­tel­li­gence as­sis­tant di­rec­tor, Mr Alan Kohler Jr, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Yeo was taught by his Chi­nese han­dlers to ask whether his tar­gets were dis­sat­is­fied with work, were hav­ing fi­nan­cial trou­bles, or had chil­dren to sup­port, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>In one case, Yeo re­cruited a civil­ian work­ing with the US Air Force on the F-35B fighter j et pro­gramme, who con­fided in him his fi­nan­cial trou­bles, and got in­for­ma­tion about the geopo­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions of the Ja­panese pur­chas­ing F-35 air­craft from the US.</p>
    <p>In another case, Yeo built a good rap­port with an of­fi­cer in the US army who had sent his re­sume to him in re­sponse to his fake job list­ings.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cer said he was trau­ma­tised by his mil­i­tary tours i n Afghanista­n and wrote a re­port for Yeo on how the with­drawal of US troops from Afghanista­n would im­pact China.</p>
    <p>A third case in­volved a US State De­part­ment em­ployee, who wrote a re­port about an un­named in­di­vid­ual who was at the time a mem­ber of the US Cabi­net.</p>
    <p>The State De­part­ment em­ployee told Yeo he feared that his re­tire­ment pen­sion would be jeop­ar­dised if of­fi­cials found out that he pro­vided in­for­ma­tion to Yeo.</p>
    <p>Yeo paid US$1,000 (S$1,400) to US$2,000 each for the re­ports, and was given a bank card by his Chi­nese han­dlers to pay for them, said the court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>He was care­ful about his com­mu­ni­ca­tions with the Chi­nese op­er­a­tives and was in­structed not to take his phone and note­books when trav­el­ling to the US.</p>
    <p>He was told not to com­mu­ni­cate with them when in the US for fear that the US gov­ern­ment would in­ter­cept their mes­sages. When out­side the US, he com­mu­ni­cated with his Chi­nese han­dlers through the Chi­nese mes­sag­ing ap­pli­ca­tion WeChat, and was told to use mul­ti­ple phones and to change his WeChat ac­count ev­ery time he did so.</p>
