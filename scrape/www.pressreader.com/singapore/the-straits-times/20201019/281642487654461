    <p>What United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s crit­ics find coarse and vul­gar, 75-year-old Doug Kelly, with a Trump cap on his head, finds grat­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>“What ap­peals to me?” mused Mr Kelly as he sat at the wheel of his golf cart, his wife Mar­ion next to him. “The econ­omy. His brash way that he talks, he’s not a... politi­cian,” he said of Mr Trump. “I think the coun­try’s gonna move ahead real good, and I don’t wanna live in a so­cial­ist coun­try.”</p>
    <p>“The stock mar­ket is go­ing up – I like that,” Mr Kelly added.</p>
    <p>He was a Demo­crat un­til a while ago, but “the Demo­cratic Party has changed; it’s more rad­i­cal now”.</p>
    <p>He and his wife live in The Vil­lages, a sprawl­ing and usu­ally loy­ally Repub­li­can re­tire­ment com­mu­nity of around 122,000 near Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>Later, invit­ing me to sit at their ta­ble at one of the semi-out­door restau­rants suited to Florida’s balmy weather, Mr Kelly said: “I watch only Fox News.”</p>
    <p>But there is a hint of change in the air. Ear­lier this month, Democrats were de­lighted that the res­i­dents mus­tered a 500-strong golf cart pro­ces­sion for Mr Joe Bi­den as they turned in their vote-by-mail bal­lots.</p>
    <p>It was a sign of the nee­dle mov­ing ever so slightly against Mr Trump in the Sun­shine State, the third most pop­u­lous and eighth most di­verse in the Union.</p>
    <p>A mile away out­side The Vil­lages, a steady stream of mostly mid­dle-aged or el­derly folk have been drop­ping into the Joe Bi­denKa­mala Har­ris cam­paign of­fice, manned also by res­i­dents of The Vil­lages – who say they are see­ing more Repub­li­cans switch­ing to sup­port­ing the Democrats.</p>
    <p>One key driver is the Pres­i­dent’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>LOS­ING SE­NIORS?</p>
    <p>Res­i­dent Chris Stan­ley, a veteran of many elec­tion cam­paigns and cur­rently pres­i­dent of The Vil­lages Demo­cratic Club, told The Straits Times the switch is not wish­ful think­ing but “an ac­tual thing”.</p>
    <p>“To a de­gree, it’s his mis­han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic,” she said. “Many peo­ple here have lost a loved one and that didn’t nec­es­sar­ily have to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“To a slightly larger de­gree, it’s what­ever the of­fen­sive tweet of the morn­ing is – the last straw that breaks the camel’s back.”</p>
    <p>There’s also the fear that Pres­i­dent Trump in his sec­ond term will re­duce fund­ing for so­cial se­cu­rity, which comes from in­stru­ments like the pay­roll tax that he wants to cut to stim­u­late the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump, on the of­fen­sive in Florida as his team senses trou­ble, in­sisted at a rally in the state last Fri­day that he would pro­tect se­niors’ so­cial se­cu­rity ben­e­fits. In an e-mail that night, his cam­paign said “our se­niors will be the first in line for the vac­cine”.</p>
    <p>DIS­PLACED TRUST</p>
    <p>The Democrats may gain some votes as well from Puerto Ri­cans re­set­tled in Florida af­ter the 2017 Hur­ri­cane Maria laid waste to the is­land, which Mr Trump al­legedly mused about sell­ing off.</p>
    <p>A lib­eral US$13 bil­lion (S$17.7 bil­lion) in fed­eral as­sis­tance to Puerto Rico an­nounced just weeks ago has cut lit­tle ice, ob­servers say, with Puerto Ri­cans un­happy with him.</p>
    <p>Add to that a steady stream of peo­ple from lib­eral cities like New York who have mi­grated to Florida.</p>
    <p>And a few thou­sand votes mat­ter in Florida, where mar­gins can be ra­zor thin. In the 2018 midterm elec­tions, the win­ners were de­cided by 0.4 per cent of the vote in the gover­nor’s race and 0.2 per cent in the US Se­nate race.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Mr Trump won with 1.2 per cent more of the vote in Florida than his ri­val Hil­lary Clin­ton. Florida has 29 votes in the Elec­toral Col­lege. A can­di­date needs 270 for a ma­jor­ity in the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>“The Democrats don’t have to win Florida to win,” ex­plained po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Charles Zelden, who is a pro­fes­sor at Nova South­east­ern Univer­sity in Fort Laud­erdale. “It is a must-win, how­ever, for Trump,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>“If Bi­den wins Florida, it’s al­most im­pos­si­ble for Trump to win the Elec­toral Col­lege. He would have to not only pick up the states that he had won last time; he would have to pick up ad­di­tional states to make up for the loss of 29 elec­toral votes.</p>
    <p>“Florida isn’t the tip­ping point state, but it is the bell­wether state.”</p>
    <p>Both par­ties have small armies of lawyers on call to fight if the Florida vote count is chal­lenged.</p>
    <p>Mr Jef­frey Gar­cia, a po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tant run­ning sev­eral Demo­cratic can­di­dates’ lo­cal and tele­vi­sion cam­paigns, said that as a re­al­ist, it is best for the cam­paign to as­sume Florida is tied.</p>
    <p>“I would rather be Joe Bi­den today than Don­ald Trump,” he said. “That does not mean the race is over. It means Joe Bi­den is in a more ad­van­ta­geous po­si­tion today.”</p>
