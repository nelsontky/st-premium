    <p>The two new lo­cally trans­mit­ted Covid-19 cases con­firmed yes­ter­day were mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, said the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>One was symp­to­matic and tested when he de­vel­oped acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms while the other was asymp­to­matic and de­tected through the fort­nightly rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>There were also three im­ported cases that were asymp­to­matic, mak­ing up a to­tal of five new cases yes­ter­day and bring­ing the to­tal num­ber to 57,970.</p>
    <p>The three im­ported cases were a 25-year-old fe­male Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, a 34-year-old fe­male In­dian na­tional hold­ing a de­pen­dant’s pass and a 66-year-old fe­male In­done­sian short-term visit pass holder who had been al­lowed en­try to visit her child, who is a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>They had re­turned from Bri­tain, the United Arab Emi­rates and In­done­sia and were placed on stay­home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and tested then.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress and all the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the cases have been iso­lated and placed in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so as to de­tect asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>Sero­log­i­cal tests will be also con­ducted for close con­tacts to de­ter­mine if the cases could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said that the clus­ter in North Coast Lodge has been closed as there have been no cases linked to it for 28 days – the equiv­a­lent of two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased to two in the past week, from five cases in the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has stayed at two a week in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 14 new cases dis­charged, 57,843 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 51 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 33 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
