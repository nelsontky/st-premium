    <p>Mr Lee Teng-hui, Tai­wan’s first demo­crat­i­cally elected pres­i­dent, died from mul­ti­ple or­gan fail­ure yes­ter­day evening. He was 97.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen, who vis­ited Mr Lee in hos­pi­tal on Wednes­day, de­scribed his con­tri­bu­tion to Tai­wan as “ir­re­place­able” in her con­do­lences to his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Tsai be­lieves that for­mer pres­i­dent Lee’s con­tri­bu­tion to Tai­wan’s democrati­sa­tion is ir­re­place­able, and his pass­ing is (Tai­wan’s) big­gest loss,” said Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral to the Pres­i­dent Su Jia-chyuan, who re­layed her mes­sage of con­do­lence shortly after Mr Lee’s death.</p>
    <p>Two days be­fore his pass­ing, ru­mours of the for­mer pres­i­dent’s death cir­cu­lated on so­cial me­dia, lead­ing many jour­nal­ists to camp out­side the Taipei Veter­ans Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, where Mr Lee had been hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>He had been in hospice care since early Fe­bru­ary, after chok­ing on milk at home. He was later di­ag­nosed with pneu­mo­nia, and was in­tu­bated over the past five months.</p>
    <p>Dr Hwang Shinn-Jang, one of Mr Lee’s physi­cians, said that the for­mer pres­i­dent suf­fered from re­peated in­fec­tions dur­ing his 174 days in the hos­pi­tal, but that “he fought like a war­rior for his life”.</p>
    <p>Hailed lo­cally as the “Fa­ther of Tai­wan” or “Un­cle Ahui” by his sup­port­ers, Mr Lee served as pres­i­dent for 21/2 terms, from 1988 to 2000.</p>
    <p>In 1988, as vice-pres­i­dent, Mr Lee stepped in to fill the seat va­cated by the Kuom­intang’s Chiang Ching-kuo, who died.</p>
    <p>In 1996, Mr Lee went on to be­come the first pres­i­dent to be elected through a demo­cratic vote and was sub­se­quently re-elected for a sec­ond term.</p>
    <p>Un­like the ma­jor­ity of the mem­bers of the Kuom­intang party that fol­lowed Chiang Kai-shek to Tai­wan after los­ing the Chi­nese Civil War, Mr Lee was Tai­wanese-born and raised dur­ing the Ja­panese colo­nial rule.</p>
    <p>After pur­su­ing his ed­u­ca­tion in Tai­wan, Ja­pan and the United States, Mr Lee re­turned to Tai­wan and was taken un­der Mr Chiang Ching-kuo’s wing, be­com­ing the first Tai­wanese-born politi­cian in the Chiang fam­ily’s in­ner cir­cle.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his 12 years in of­fice, Mr Lee peace­fully moved Tai­wan to­wards a free democ­racy, end­ing the state of emer­gency the Kuom­intang had im­posed in case of con­flict with China, amended the Con­sti­tu­tion to al­low for the di­rect elec­tion of the pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent and had all leg­isla­tive seats re-elected, to re­place the un­elected Par­lia­ment un­der the Chiang fam­ily.</p>
    <p>An­other mile­stone in Mr Lee’s tenure was his Go South ini­tia­tive, the plan to branch out in Asia and es­tab­lish trade ties with South-east Asian coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But the ini­tial suc­cess of Tai­wanese in­vestors fiz­zled after a se­ries of in­ci­dents, such as the 1997 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the 1998 anti-Chi­nese ri­ots in In­done­sia and in­cen­tives by China that at­tracted for­eign in­vest­ments, in­clud­ing from Tai­wanese busi­nesses who moved their fac­to­ries to China.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Tsai now has a New South­bound Pol­icy, en­cour­ag­ing the same Tai­wanese busi­nesses to put their eggs in var­i­ous bas­kets, re­ly­ing less on China and mov­ing their op­er­a­tions to other coun­tries in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee is sur­vived by Madam Tseng Wen-hui, his wife of 71 years, two daugh­ters and their fam­i­lies. His son Lee Hsien-wen died of can­cer in 1982.</p>
