    <p>Much progress has been made on im­prov­ing the lot of the low­est paid work­ers as their earn­ings were built up sec­tor by sec­tor, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam yes­ter­day, in a spir­ited de­bate in the House on how to tackle in­come and so­cial in­equal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Much progress has been made on im­prov­ing the lot of the low­est­paid work­ers as their earn­ings were built up sec­tor by sec­tor, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts to do so in­volve the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model (PWM), which he called a “min­i­mum wage plus”, Work­fare sub­si­dies and many other means, Mr Thar­man added.</p>
    <p>“And it’s not a job that’s done for good. We have to do more.”</p>
    <p>Rais­ing the stan­dard of liv­ing of the poor is a com­pli­cated mat­ter, he noted, with one is­sue be­ing how to achieve this goal with­out los­ing the wage earner’s abil­ity to have the pride of a job and earn a salary.</p>
    <p>“I say this, by the way, as an econ­o­mist, as some­one who stud­ies over­seas ex­pe­ri­ence very care­fully, and who – to­gether with my col­leagues – is a prac­ti­tioner,” he added.</p>
    <p>Rising to join the spir­ited de­bate in the House that lasted nearly an hour on how to tackle in­come and so­cial in­equal­i­ties, he said no one should as­sume that he has a mo­nop­oly over com­pas­sion.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that he had been taken by the pas­sion­ate speeches from many of his party col­leagues on the sub­ject, he said: “I would like to sug­gest that none of us have a mo­nop­oly over com­pas­sion, and I say this not to dis­credit any­one.”</p>
    <p>The de­bate was sparked by a speech by Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC), who ar­gued for a min­i­mum wage in his maiden speech in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He said there was in­suf­fi­cient com­pas­sion in Sin­ga­pore’s pol­i­cy­mak­ing, and that ef­fi­ciency was pri­ori­tised at the ex­pense of eq­uity.</p>
    <p>“I humbly sug­gest that the root of these chal­lenges is in­suf­fi­cient com­pas­sion in our pol­i­cy­mak­ing process,” he said.</p>
    <p>This prompted sev­eral Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MPs to ques­tion As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim on whether im­pos­ing a min­i­mum wage in the mid­dle of a re­ces­sion would hit work­ers hard.</p>
    <p>They also wanted to know what wage level he would set as a min­i­mum and his plans to im­prove youth un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to the flurry of questions, Prof Lim con­ceded that now was not the right time to im­ple­ment a min­i­mum wage, given the eco­nomic fall­out from the pan­demic, but sug­gested it could be stud­ied now and rolled out when the sit­u­a­tion im­proved.</p>
    <p>He also said he did not have a spe­cific min­i­mum wage in mind and this should be de­ter­mined by an in­de­pen­dent panel.</p>
    <p>As for youth un­em­ploy­ment, he did not have a pro­posal, he said, as he “had not thought about it”.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the de­bate later, Mr Thar­man said he “would not ex­ag­ger­ate” the dif­fer­ences be­tween the min­i­mum wage model ad­vo­cated by Prof Lim and the PWM prac­tised by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment does be­lieve it is im­por­tant to raise the wages of its low­est-paid work­ers, he said.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally be­lieve this. We’ve achieved sig­nif­i­cant progress in the last 10 years and in the last five years, and we think we should go fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>He de­scribed PWM as “min­i­mum wage plus” with a sec­toral ap­proach. It also had the ben­e­fit of al­low­ing pol­i­cy­mak­ers to set the min­i­mum rung at an ac­cept­able level for each sec­tor, he said.</p>
    <p>“If you have a sin­gle level, you’ll have to de­cide where to pitch it,” Mr Thar­man said.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Prof Lim said he re­gret­ted if it came across that he was sug­gest­ing he, his party or any in­di­vid­ual has a mo­nop­oly over com­pas­sion. He just wanted eq­uity to be favoured over ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>The House also saw ex­changes be­tween WP MP Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) and sev­eral PAP of­fice-hold­ers on the topic of race.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim asked yes­ter­day if the Govern­ment would con­sider the pos­si­bil­ity of bring­ing the var­i­ous race-based self-help groups un­der a sin­gle na­tional um­brella.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Ma­liki Os­man, whose speech Ms Lim was re­spond­ing to, replied that although the var­i­ous self-help groups do work to­gether, hav­ing dis­tinct groups en­sures that each com­mu­nity has the space to un­der­stand its own is­sues and chal­lenges, and work at its own pace.</p>
