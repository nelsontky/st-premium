    <p>For­mer se­nior min­is­ter S. Jayaku­mar has launched a book chron­i­cling his views and ex­pe­ri­ences of Sin­ga­pore’s gov­er­nance, in­clud­ing his views on the Lee fam­ily dis­pute over the Ox­ley Road home and Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s re­tire­ment plan if the Covid-19 cri­sis does not abate.</p>
    <p>For­mer se­nior min­is­ter S. Jayaku­mar has launched a book chron­i­cling his ex­pe­ri­ences of Sin­ga­pore’s gov­er­nance, as well as giv­ing his views on is­sues such as the Lee fam­ily dis­pute over their 38 Ox­ley Road home and Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s re­tire­ment plan if the Covid-19 cri­sis does not abate.</p>
    <p>Ti­tled Gov­ern­ing: A Sin­ga­pore Per­spec­tive, the 192-page vol­ume in­cludes first-hand and be­hindthe-scenes ac­counts of his time spent work­ing with found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, as well as top­ics such as Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion, the 4G lead­ers and this year’s gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>At the book launch yes­ter­day at the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs, Prof Jayaku­mar, 81, said that when he be­gan writ­ing the book, it was never his in­ten­tion to give a les­son to Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been in pol­i­tics long enough to know that Sin­ga­pore­ans don’t like to be told lessons, don’t like preach­ing by ex-min­is­ters or min­is­ters. Those of us who are par­ents will know that when we tell our kids how it was back in our time, their eyes glaze over.</p>
    <p>“But... I can best de­scribe the book as my in­vi­ta­tion to Sin­ga­porean read­ers to come with me on a jour­ney into be­hind-the-scenes work­ings of the Gov­ern­ment, and try to lift the veil of mys­tery.”</p>
    <p>His pre­vi­ous book in 2015, Be At The Ta­ble Or Be On The Menu: A Sin­ga­pore Mem­oir, dis­cussed Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign pol­icy and de­vel­op­ments dur­ing his po­lit­i­cal ca­reer which spanned 31 years.</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen, who was guest of hon­our at the launch, said he counts Prof Jayaku­mar as a “close friend and fear­some golf kaki”.</p>
    <p>He had this to say of the man who had worked with all three of Sin­ga­pore’s prime min­is­ters: “There are very few like him who have been in the thick of the ac­tion or had ring­side seats to Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal strug­gles across such a lengthy pe­riod. It is no won­der then that Prof Jayaku­mar writes with authen­tic­ity and au­thor­ity, not vi­car­i­ously be­stowed by po­si­tion, but as a first-hand wit­ness of those events.”</p>
    <p>Prof Jayaku­mar, he added, “has no axe to grind, no point to prove, no lofty am­bi­tion that craves to be ful­filled”.</p>
    <p>“Brief, to the point, no hy­per­bole or un­sub­stan­ti­ated as­ser­tions, with caveats where nec­es­sary for pre­ci­sion, cou­pled with a prodi­gious mem­ory and sear­ing in­tel­lect. These qual­i­ties not only trans­late to re­li­able ac­counts, but also con­vey the core of the is­sues, chal­lenges and events dis­tilled in his book,” Dr Ng said.</p>
    <p>Prof Jayaku­mar en­tered pol­i­tics in 1980 and held port­fo­lios in­clud­ing for­eign af­fairs, law, home af­fairs and labour. He was deputy prime min­is­ter from 2004 to 2009.</p>
    <p>He re­tired from pol­i­tics at the 2011 Gen­eral Elec­tion, but has con­tin­ued to ad­vise the Gov­ern­ment, at first in an un­of­fi­cial ca­pac­ity, and from June 2018 as Se­nior Le­gal Ad­viser to the Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, he was awarded Sin­ga­pore’s high­est civil­ian hon­our, the Or­der of Te­masek (With High Dis­tinc­tion).</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said that in writ­ing the book, Prof Jayaku­mar’s in­tent is not only to in­form and some­times en­ter­tain, but, ul­ti­mately, to leave the reader with the sem­i­nal truths and choices that Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans must make to mas­ter their own fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“This book does not shy away from provoca­tive is­sues, as long as they are core to Sin­ga­pore’s ex­is­tence and well-be­ing.”</p>
