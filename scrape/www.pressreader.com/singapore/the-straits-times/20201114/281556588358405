    <p>Un­able to re­turn home to his fam­ily in In­dia this year, Mr Nal­la­marudhu Mu­ni­asami ex­pected Deep­avali at his dor­mi­tory to be a muted af­fair.</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic still rag­ing in his home town of Ra­manatha­pu­ram, in the south­ern part of Tamil Nadu, Mr Mu­ni­asami, 39, did not have high hopes of mak­ing the trip back to cel­e­brate the fes­ti­val with his par­ents, wife and two sons, aged 15 and 18.</p>
    <p>On Nov 5, he watched cu­ri­ously as a team of dec­o­ra­tors ar­rived at the fac­tory-con­verted dor­mi­tory in Tuas View Square, where he works as its cus­to­dian. He stays there with about 70 other work­ers.</p>
    <p>When the work­ers re­turned to the dorm af­ter work, they were greeted by twin­kling fairy lights, hoard­ings that were painted gold, and bright flow­ers, turn­ing the dorm into what one worker called a “wed­ding house”.</p>
    <p>The trans­for­ma­tion was a re­sult of the ef­forts of Mr Mu­ni­asami’s boss, Ms Joey Tan, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of lo­cal in­dus­trial en­gi­neer­ing firm McKnight En­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, 44, wanted to give the work­ers, who were anx­ious about the pan­demic and their fam­i­lies, some­thing to look for­ward to.</p>
    <p>She said: “I wish I can do more for them, like tak­ing them out for a day or two. But it is not al­lowed at this mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“We started plan­ning this in midOc­to­ber, and it was re­ally worth it to see the looks on their faces.</p>
    <p>“The lights are fan­tas­tic. Hope­fully it will bring them some joy.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the ini­tial sur­prise, the beam­ing work­ers made video calls to their fam­ily mem­bers over­seas and showed them what their boss had done.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Tamil, Mr Mu­ni­asami said: “My wife was jeal­ous. She said although I am alone here, I seem to be hav­ing a bet­ter Deep­avali than my rel­a­tives back home.”</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, his home town is abuzz with fire­works and fes­tive fairs as Deep­avali ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>This year, the whole place is like a ghost town due to a lock­down amid a spike in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily’s sole bread­win­ner is most wor­ried for his mother, a can­cer pa­tient in her late 60s.</p>
    <p>He said: “While the cir­cuit breaker was on here, my mother had to stay in a hospi­tal there to un­dergo chemo­ther­apy. I felt guilty that my son had to care for my par­ents, which is my duty. My wife even pawned some of her jew­ellery to pay for the med­i­cal ex­penses.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­ni­asami’s elder son, a nurs­ing stu­dent, hopes to work at a Sin­ga­pore hospi­tal one day.</p>
    <p>His younger son is in In­dia’s equiv­a­lent of ju­nior col­lege.</p>
    <p>When Ms Tan heard about his plight, she of­fered to help him fi­nan­cially. Said Mr Mu­ni­asami: “She helps us meet pay­ments for our chil­dren’s an­nual school fees and looks out for us. Her at­ten­tion and care is why I have stayed on with the com­pany for eight years, and I will not look for work any­where else.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tan also gave the work­ers gift packs of choco­lates and cash rang­ing from $450 to $1,500.</p>
    <p>She said: “The cir­cuit breaker and last few months were hard on the work­ers. One worker’s fa­ther had a fail­ing kid­ney and his brother could not walk af­ter an ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“We ap­pealed to the em­bassy and man­aged to send him home on a char­tered flight.”</p>
    <p>About six work­ers at the dorm con­tracted Covid-19 this year.</p>
    <p>All have since re­cov­ered fully. To­day, the dorm res­i­dents will en­joy a spe­cially catered meal, with masala crab and fried fish, along with mu­sic, snacks and games. Ms Tan said this is her way of thank­ing the work­ers for stick­ing by her in a chal­leng­ing year.</p>
    <p>She said: “Af­ter com­mer­cial flights to In­dia be­came avail­able in Au­gust, the work­ers made the hard de­ci­sion to re­main here be­cause of their fam­i­lies’ needs.</p>
    <p>“This is the least I could do to thank them for build­ing this com­pany with me, and for build­ing Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
