    <p>• The Covid-19 pan­demic played havoc with the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) this sea­son, and com­mis­sioner Adam Silver has in­di­cated that the league is ex­pect­ing NBA play­ers to not par­tic­i­pate at next year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>With the start of the next NBA sea­son post­poned un­til at least Jan­uary, a full 82-game sched­ule and play-offs would not be com­pleted by the time the post­poned Games be­gin in late July.</p>
    <p>The Olympics orig­i­nally were sched­uled for this sum­mer, but were pushed back a year be­cause of the pan­demic. In nor­mal years, the Games take place dur­ing the NBA’s off-sea­son, but that will not be the case this time.</p>
    <p>“It’s un­likely, at the end of the day, that, if we start late, we would stop for the Olympics,” Silver said at the Dis­ney World, where Game 3 of the NBA Fi­nals tips off this morn­ing (Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>“Be­cause, as you know, it’s not just a func­tion of stop­ping for the pe­riod in which they are com­pet­ing over in Tokyo. They re­quire train­ing camp, and then they re­quire rest af­ter­wards.”</p>
    <p>NBA play­ers have been par­tic­i­pat­ing in in­ter­na­tional tour­na­ments since the rules changed in 1989. At the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, the USA “Dream Team” dom­i­nated the com­pe­ti­tion and they have won ev­ery gold medal since, ex­cept for the 2004 Athens Games when the team was left with a bronze medal, with Ar­gentina win­ning the gold.</p>
    <p>The lack of NBA play­ers would af­fect not just the US. With more than 100 in­ter­na­tional play­ers on NBA ros­ters, coun­tries like Aus­tralia, France, Spain and hosts Ja­pan, who boast Washington Wiz­ards for­ward Rui Hachimura, would be im­pacted.</p>
    <p>Coaches would also be in a tricky spot. San An­to­nio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is set to lead Team USA in Tokyo, with Golden State War­riors’ Steve Kerr and At­lanta Hawks’ Lloyd Pierce his as­sis­tants.</p>
    <p>War­riors as­so­ciate head coach Mike Brown is set to coach Nige­ria, while Toronto Rap­tors as­sis­tant Ser­gio Scar­i­olo oversees Spain.</p>
    <p>Rap­tors head coach Nick Nurse will lead Canada should they qual­ify.</p>
    <p>“I’d only say these are such ex­tra­or­di­nary cir­cum­stances that, even if we set out to plan for the Olympics, how can they even know what the world is go­ing to be like next sum­mer and whether they can go for­ward?” Silver said.</p>
