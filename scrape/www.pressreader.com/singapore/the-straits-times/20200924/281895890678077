    <p>MUM­BAI • The death toll in a res­i­den­tial build­ing collapse at Bhi­wandi, 38km west of the In­dian fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal of Mum­bai, has risen to 39 as res­cue op­er­a­tions con­tin­ued yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ca­su­al­ties in­cluded 12 chil­dren, with 25 peo­ple who suf­fered mul­ti­ple in­juries ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal af­ter the three-storey build­ing col­lapsed early on Mon­day while res­i­dents were asleep.</p>
    <p>Emer­gency work­ers from the National Disas­ter Re­sponse Force (NDRF) have so far pulled 20 sur­vivors from the rub­ble.</p>
    <p>A se­nior NDRF of­fi­cial said that re­cov­ery teams, aided by snif­fer dogs, re­trieved 39 bod­ies buried un­der brick and con­crete. “Five peo­ple are still miss­ing so... op­er­a­tions are on­go­ing,” NDRF com­man­dant Anu­pam Sri­vas­tava said.</p>
    <p>As the de­bris was be­ing cleared from the struc­ture that housed 40 flats, with around 150 res­i­dents, the police booked the owner of the col­lapsed build­ing for cul­pa­ble homi­cide, claim­ing “nei­ther did he take ef­forts to re­pair the build­ing’s bro­ken pil­lar, nor did he con­vince peo­ple to va­cate the build­ing”.</p>
    <p>Two of­fi­cials were also sus­pended in con­nec­tion with the in­ci­dent, the spokesman for the civic body said.</p>
    <p>The mon­soon sea­son from June to Septem­ber, which brings tor­ren­tial rains, is of­ten blamed for the collapse of di­lap­i­dated and il­le­gally built struc­tures in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Last month, over a dozen peo­ple died af­ter a build­ing col­lapsed in the in­dus­trial town of Ma­had, 165km south of Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>Most of the res­i­dents of the ill­fated build­ing were auto-rick­shaw driv­ers, ven­dors or labour­ers, who paid rent of about US$40 to US$54 (S$55 to S$74) a month.</p>
    <p>Bhi­wandi, a tex­tile hub with the largest power looms in Asia’s third­largest econ­omy, has turned into a lo­gis­tics cen­tre, with e-com­merce com­pa­nies set­ting up ware­houses to cater to Mum­bai’s grow­ing con­sumer de­mand.</p>
    <p>“There was a power loom at the ground floor of the build­ing where some work­ers were be­lieved to have been asleep when the build­ing caved in,” said Mr Milind Pal­sule, pub­lic re­la­tions of­fi­cer of the lo­cal civic body.</p>
    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi and Home Min­is­ter Amit Shah have of­fered their con­do­lences over the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the National Crime Records Bureau, 38,363 peo­ple lost their lives due to the collapse of var­i­ous struc­tures, mostly res­i­den­tial, be­tween 2001 and 2015.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, heavy overnight down­pours in the Mum­bai re­gion forced the rail­way au­thor­i­ties to resched­ule or can­cel trains in the city yes­ter­day due to wa­ter­log­ging on the tracks.</p>
