    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your cul­tural ideas are start­ing to take shape and you may want to in­dulge in a cre­ative romp. Your fiery en­ergy helps you to im­press peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your sub­con­scious is ac­tive, which means that you have plenty of brain­storms and may start see­ing things more clearly.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You have to let go of at least one idea – it may have worked be­fore but it is not set in stone. Shake things up and you will start to shine.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You have to make sure you are fo­cus­ing your en­ergy on the right peo­ple. You should find that you are at your best help­ing those in need.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing gen­er­ous and you have the en­ergy and re­sources to help oth­ers. Im­press a friend or stranger with an act of kind­ness.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You have to take today’s is­sues less se­ri­ously. Some­times the best so­lu­tion is to drift aim­lessly and see where the world takes you.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are think­ing through some big is­sues, so make sure you are tak­ing notes or find­ing ways to re­mem­ber all the in­sights that come your way.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You do not feel quite right about an of­fer on the ta­ble – your in­stincts are send­ing warn­ing signs. Walk away and come back an­other time.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) A new friend­ship is on the way, though likely from an un­ex­pected di­rec­tion. Your great en­ergy makes you a bea­con to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You make great progress and can face al­most any chal­lenge. You may find your­self won­der­ing about past achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Try to reach out to some­one new – a group you rely on needs new mem­bers to stay alive. Just one new face might be all it takes.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You have to think more care­fully, es­pe­cially amid a tense so­cial sit­u­a­tion. You may slip up and pre­ma­turely re­veal a truth.</p>
