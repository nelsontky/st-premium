    <p>SHANGHAI • China re­ported 16 new Covid-19 cases on Fri­day, down from 17 the pre­vi­ous day, with seven cases of lo­cal trans­mis­sion and nine cases orig­i­nat­ing overseas, the coun­try’s health author­ity has said.</p>
    <p>China’s Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day in its daily bul­letin that five of the lo­cal trans­mis­sions took place in Tian­jin and two in Shanghai.</p>
    <p>Tian­jin, which neigh­bours the cap­i­tal Bei­jing, was sched­uled to launch a three-day screen­ing pro­gramme cov­er­ing nearly three mil­lion of its res­i­dents yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal of­fi­cials said on Fri­day that one com­mu­nity in Tian­jin had been placed i n l ock­down and around 1,900 peo­ple have been quar­an­tined, ac­cord­ing to the China Daily news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>In He­bei province, four res­i­den­tial com­mu­ni­ties and two vil­lages in Luan­nan county, Tang­shan, have been locked down af­ter the lo­cal govern­ment re­ceived no­tice that one of the Tian­jin pa­tients, a 61-year-old man sur­named Yang, had trav­elled to the county, the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang drove to the county last Sun­day and left on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that pe­riod, he vis­ited rel­a­tives, had din­ner with friends and shopped at var­i­ous places.</p>
    <p>Pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures are be­ing taken in Shanghai’s Pudong district, city of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two new Shanghai in­fec</p>
    <p>tions in­volved a se­cu­rity in­spec­tor at Pudong In­ter­na­tional Air­port and his wife.</p>
    <p>But district of­fi­cial Li Guo­hua told a news brief­ing that there were no in­di­ca­tions so far that th­ese were linked to a pre­vi­ously re­ported lo­cal trans­mis­sion in­volv­ing an­other air­port worker.</p>
    <p>Mon­go­lia yes­ter­day re­ported four more lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases of Covid-19 in its south-eastern Dornogovi province, ac­cord­ing to the coun­try’s Na­tional Cen­tre for Com­mu­ni­ca­ble Diseases.</p>
    <p>Mon­go­lia en­tered a state of pub­lic disas­ter pre­pared­ness and im­posed a na­tion­wide 24-hour lock­down from Nov 12 un­til Dec 1 af­ter its first lo­cally trans­mit­ted Covid-19 case, which was a woman, whose hus­band, a trans­port driver, re­turned from Rus­sia and tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
