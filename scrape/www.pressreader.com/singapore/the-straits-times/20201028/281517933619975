    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The day ended well for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Mon­day when he got to pre­side over the swear­ing in of a new, con­ser­va­tive Supreme Court judge – Jus­tice Amy Coney Bar­rett.</p>
    <p>It ce­mented one of his prin­ci­pal lega­cies and a core con­ser­va­tive agenda – to tilt the Bench in favour of the con­ser­va­tives.</p>
    <p>Supreme Court judges have life ten­ure and serve un­til they re­tire or die, so the change will go a long way and is rea­son for the con­ser­va­tives to cel­e­brate.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Repub­li­cans in the United States Se­nate used their ma­jor­ity, with only one ex­cep­tion – Sen­a­tor Su­san Collins of Maine – to ram through the con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Never be­fore has a Supreme Court judge been con­firmed so close to a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, with the can­di­dates storm­ing bat­tle­ground states with just seven days to go.</p>
    <p>They are neck and neck in sev­eral states, al­though Demo­cratic Party chal­lenger Joe Bi­den re­mains ahead of Pres­i­dent Trump in na­tional polls.</p>
    <p>In the face of the Repub­li­can ma­jor­ity, Democrats were pow­er­less even as they as­sailed Repub­li­cans for hypocrisy; in 2016 the Repub­li­can-led Se­nate re­fused to hold hear­ings for then-Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s nom­i­nee for a Supreme Court seat, Judge Mer­rick Gar­land, even with months to go be­fore that year’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Bar­rett, who is al­ready be­ing re­ferred to by her ini­tials ACB, re­places the leg­endary RBG, Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, who died last month at the age of 87.</p>
    <p>Her ap­point­ment so­lid­i­fies a 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity in the Supreme Court, and it comes in the nick of time – the court is set to hear cases on the Pres­i­dent’s taxes (which he has so far with­held dis­clo­sure on), a string of elec­tion-re­lated cases, and an abor­tion rights case in Mis­sis­sippi.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Bar­rett, 48, is known for her con­ser­vatism and her “orig­i­nal­ist” views on the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing jointly in The At­lantic, in­de­pen­dent Sen­a­tor from Maine An­gus King Jr and Bos­ton Col­lege pro­fes­sor of his­tory Heather Cox Richard­son said: “This idea sounds sim­ple and sen­si­ble: In de­ter­min­ing what the Con­sti­tu­tion per­mits, a judge must first look to the plain mean­ing of the text, and if that isn’t clear, then ap­ply what was in the minds of the 55 men who wrote it in 1787. Pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing else is ‘ju­di­cial law­mak­ing’.”</p>
    <p>Lib­er­als and women’s rights ad­vo­cates fear that with a con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity on the Bench, the Supreme Court could even over­turn the 1973 Roe v Wade rul­ing – which de­crim­i­nalised</p>
    <p>Her (Jus­tice Bar­rett’s) ap­point­ment so­lid­i­fies a 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity in the Supreme Court, and it comes in the nick of time – the court is set to hear cases on the Pres­i­dent’s taxes (which he has so far with­held dis­clo­sure on), a string of elec­tion-re­lated cases, and an abor­tion rights case in Mis­sis­sippi.</p>
    <p>abor­tion – long in the sights of religious con­ser­va­tives.</p>
    <p>Ge­orge­town Univer­sity law pro­fes­sor Lawrence Gostin tweeted: “It’s all down to our orig­i­nal­ist rugged in­di­vid­u­al­ism.”</p>
    <p>But he added: “I don’t fore­see her strik­ing down ACA (the Af­ford­able Care Act known as Oba­macare), but she’ll re­duce health­care ac­cess. I don’t see her over­turn­ing Roe, but will evis­cer­ate it, mak­ing abor­tion im­pos­si­ble for the poor.”</p>
    <p>Ms Grace Meng, Demo­cratic Con­gress­woman from New York, tweeted: “The rushed process to con­firm Judge Bar­rett to the #SupremeCou­rt will have un­fore­seen con­se­quences for our na­tion. Women’s re­pro­duc­tive health and those with pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions face an even greater un­cer­tain fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump has al­ready been tout­ing his record on ap­point­ing con­ser­va­tive judges to the ju­di­ciary, and will claim brag­ging rights to the lat­est, which will be use­ful for his cam­paign.</p>
    <p>He has now placed three Supreme Court jus­tices on the Bench.</p>
    <p>But the new com­po­si­tion of the Supreme Court Bench, which an­a­lysts ar­gue is not rep­re­sen­ta­tive of Amer­ica’s in­creas­ing di­ver­sity, may not go un­con­tested.</p>
    <p>Some Democrats are ar­gu­ing that if Mr Bi­den wins the loom­ing elec­tion, and the Demo­cratic Party wrests a ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate, which pun­dits say is a dis­tinct pos­si­bil­ity, it should “pack the court” – mean­ing in­crease the num­ber of judges on the Bench – thus neu­tral­is­ing the con­ser­va­tive tilt in the apex court.</p>
    <p>“Ex­pand the court,” New York Con­gress­woman Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez tweeted, a com­ment which was echoed swiftly by her equally pro­gres­sive col­league, Con­gress­woman Il­han Omar. Asked about this at a cam­paign event on Mon­day, Mr Bi­den said: “It’s a life­time ap­point­ment. I’m not go­ing to at­tempt to change that at all.”</p>
    <p>But he men­tioned ideas from schol­ars in­clud­ing the “pos­si­bil­ity of (judges) go­ing from one court to another court, not just stay­ing the whole time on (the Supreme Court)”. How­ever, he said he had made “no judg­ment” on that course of ac­tion.</p>
