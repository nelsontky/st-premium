    <p>The sud­den death of Tai­wanese singer-ac­tor-host Alien Huang has sent shock­waves through the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try in Tai­wan and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old was found dead in his Taipei home on Wed­nes­day. The cause of death is cur­rently un­known, though a freak ac­ci­dent is sus­pected.</p>
    <p>He had a strong con­nec­tion to Sin­ga­pore as he starred in the Me­di­a­corp drama Joys Of Life (2012) and was the lead­ing man in lo­cal ac­tress Michelle Chong’s di­rec­to­rial de­but Al­ready Fa­mous.</p>
    <p>Chong said on In­sta­gram that he would for­ever be the first lead­ing man in her life.</p>
    <p>His Joys Of Life co-star Andie Chen calls Huang his “most ac­cept­ing friend”.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old, who is in Tai­wan for work, did not man­age to meet Huang as he was serv­ing his quar­an­tine, which ended just last week.</p>
    <p>Chen, who is plan­ning to at­tend the funeral, tells The Straits Times over the tele­phone: “He al­ways said that Sin­ga­pore has been very kind to him and gave him a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties. He was very well-loved here.”</p>
    <p>Huang also played the lead in Fat Hope, an up­com­ing movie di­rected by En­core Films’ founder Joyce Lee.</p>
    <p>Lee, 45, says she picked him for the role as he could sing, act and had an ap­ti­tude for com­edy.</p>
    <p>“He was very hard­work­ing. He pre­pared well for his work and took care of the peo­ple around him. He was a bub­bly per­son who brought a lot of joy on set,” she says.</p>
    <p>The movie, which was filmed in 2018, is slated to open dur­ing Chi­nese New Year next year.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the scenes, he was a star with no airs.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Ai Lian, 33, who was pre­vi­ously an as­sis­tant pro­mo­tions man­ager with Huang’s agency and mu­sic la­bel Rock Records, used to man­age his sched­ule when he was in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She tells ST: “He was an easy­go­ing per­son. When he was in town for a drama shoot, he would just go for a jog in be­tween shoot­ing or eat his favourite bak chor mee. He would also re­mem­ber ev­ery staff mem­ber who had worked with him be­fore and would al­ways say hi.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing grad­u­ated from the per­form­ing arts high school Taipei Hwa Kang Arts School – alma mater to many Tai­wanese celebri­ties such as singers Cyndi Wang, Tarcy Su and host Dee Hsu – Huang en­tered the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try at an early age.</p>
    <p>His high-school sweetheart was singer Rainie Yang, with whom he re­mained friends long af­ter their teenage break-up.</p>
    <p>In a heart­felt trib­ute, Yang wrote on In­sta­gram: “I be­lieve you will still be in my fu­ture, in a dif­fer­ent way. Thank you for ap­pear­ing in my life and I’m so glad we showed our love and con­cern for each other in all the right ways.”</p>
    <p>Early on Thurs­day morn­ing, Yang posted an In­sta­gram story, with the words: “I can’t sleep, but if I don’t sleep, I can’t dream of you.”</p>
    <p>Huang was ru­moured to be dat­ing tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity and cheer­leader Wu Han-chun, 30.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his death, Wu posted a black-and-white photo of Huang sleep­ing and said they had de­lib­er­ately kept their re­la­tion­ship un­der wraps.</p>
    <p>She wrote: “Two weeks ago, you said to me: ‘Let’s not get mar­ried.’ I asked you why. You said: ‘If some­thing hap­pens to me in the fu­ture, then you won’t have to shoul­der that bur­den. You’ll have a clean slate to marry some­one else.’ But I want only you.”</p>
    <p>Huang, who made his en­ter­tain­ment de­but in the early 2000s with the short-lived boy bands HC3 and Cosmo, found suc­cess in act­ing and host­ing.</p>
    <p>He was the host of 100% En­ter­tain­ment along­side Show Lo and Linda Chien for close to a decade, leav­ing the show in 2015.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Huang be­gan host­ing pop­u­lar out­door game show Mr Player with Jacky Wu and Kid Lin.</p>
    <p>The show’s ex­ec­u­tives have can­celled its sched­uled film­ing for next week and of­fered to help Huang’s fam­ily set­tle his af­fairs.</p>
