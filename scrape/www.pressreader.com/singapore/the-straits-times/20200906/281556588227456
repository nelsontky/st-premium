    <p>It takes a cri­sis like this pan­demic to shine a light on some is­sues and make you see what is re­ally hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>The for­eign worker is­sue is a good ex­am­ple of this. Be­fore Covid-19, it seemed so ob­vi­ous that mi­grant work­ers from poor coun­tries in the re­gion do­ing work that Sin­ga­pore­ans were not pre­pared to do was a cheap and easy way to grow the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>There might have been some naysay­ers, but most peo­ple ac­cepted it was too good an op­por­tu­nity to waste – in­clud­ing the Govern­ment, busi­nesses and the hun­dreds of thou­sands of house­holds hir­ing do­mes­tic maids.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, when asked dur­ing an in­ter­view for a book, all but said the coun­try would be stupid not to do so. Per­haps it was the right thing to do for a while, but the world has changed since, no thanks to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It should now be clear to ev­ery­one that the mi­grant worker so­lu­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s work­force needs is nei­ther cheap nor easy.</p>
    <p>New dor­mi­to­ries are now be­ing built to new stan­dards of ac­com­mo­da­tion, new work ar­range­ments have been en­forced and new coro­n­avirus test­ing rules de­vised, all of which will in­crease the cost of hir­ing them.</p>
    <p>Enor­mous re­sources have been used to test, quar­an­tine and clear their dor­mi­to­ries and work sites.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther will it be so easy in the fu­ture to hire them if travel re­stric­tions and bor­der con­trols con­tinue to be en­forced.</p>
    <p>When you add up these ad­di­tional costs, it might not be cheaper to hire a Bangladesh­i or Myan­mar na­tional com­pared with a Sin­ga­porean. As a re­sult, com­pa­nies will have to redo their sums and a whole range of busi­nesses de­pen­dent on cheap labour may no longer be vi­able. It will force Sin­ga­pore to re­think its eco­nomic strat­egy.</p>
    <p>To be fair to the Govern­ment, this re­think­ing be­gan some years ago and plans were drawn up for dif­fer­ent sec­tors to im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity and up­grade the qual­ity of lo­cal com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But this trans­for­ma­tion can no longer be a grad­ual, evolv­ing process and needs to be done quickly and de­ci­sively. No one ex­pected it, but the world changed sud­denly. How should Sin­ga­pore re­think its for­eign worker pol­icy in the face of these changes?</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong spoke at length last week about how im­por­tant it was for Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue to be open to for­eign­ers work­ing here. I think most peo­ple would agree with him that the coun­try needs them, in­clud­ing at the top and bot­tom end, to sup­ple­ment its lo­cal work­force.</p>
    <p>But how to do it in a way that tur­bocharges the econ­omy, but does not un­fairly dis­ad­van­tage Sin­ga­pore­ans? There are no easy an­swers, but I hope the</p>
    <p>Govern­ment will be open to new ideas, free it­self from old as­sump­tions and en­cour­age healthy de­bate on this im­por­tant is­sue.</p>
    <p>I hope it lives up to Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s ad­dress at the open­ing of the new Par­lia­ment last month when she said: “We will lis­ten to and ex­am­ine novel ideas ob­jec­tively, recog­nis­ing that no so­lu­tions are right for all time.”</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, the an­nounce­ment to in­crease the min­i­mum salary of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als em­ployed here from $3,900 to $4,500 was a dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>If the in­ten­tion was to tighten the en­try re­quire­ment so em­ploy­ers might try harder to hire</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, the ques­tion is: Will it re­ally, or will some bosses pay for­eign­ers more to meet the new cri­te­rion? If the lat­ter, is this the right time to raise busi­ness costs when the econ­omy is strug­gling amid the na­tion’s most se­ri­ous re­ces­sion?</p>
    <p>Some em­ploy­ers might not hire for­eign­ers to avoid pay­ing the in­creased salaries, but it is a hit-and-miss af­fair. There will be some who might be de­terred but with jobs which no Sin­ga­porean is el­i­gi­ble, and oth­ers who will ab­sorb the in­creased costs even when there might be Sin­ga­pore­ans will­ing to do those jobs. Pric­ing is a blun­der­buss ap­proach that does not dis­tin­guish be­tween dif­fer­ent cases.</p>
    <p>Will merely chang­ing one num­ber in the com­plex and messy busi­ness of how a coun­try man­ages its for­eign work­ers and all the as­so­ci­ated is­sues – their terms of em­ploy­ment, wel­fare, skill lev­els, length of stay, in­te­gra­tion into Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety and so on – solve the prob­lem?</p>
    <p>I hope that in the search for bet­ter so­lu­tions, the Govern­ment does not merely tweak ex­ist­ing poli­cies, but re-ex­am­ines them fun­da­men­tally and es­pe­cially the use of pric­ing as its prin­ci­pal method.</p>
    <p>The is­sue is not just about de­mand and sup­ply and get­ting the price right, but much more com­plex and to do with, among other things, en­sur­ing fair job op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans and how they are be­ing trained in sec­tors with a high pro­por­tion of for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>In fact, the re­cent fuss over the num­ber of In­dian na­tion­als em­ployed in fi­nance and bank­ing is a good ex­am­ple of why pric­ing is such an in­ad­e­quate pol­icy. While the Govern­ment might have con­trolled the over­all num­ber of In­dian na­tion­als here, their over-con­cen­tra­tion in spe­cific sec­tors which are also highly sought af­ter by Sin­ga­pore­ans is clearly prob­lem­atic and un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>Even if it is ar­gued that their ser­vices were needed quickly to jump-start the busi­ness, it is not clear what the plan was to re­place them with Sin­ga­pore­ans who could be trained to do these jobs later. Was there such a plan?</p>
    <p>Think­ing through and im­ple­ment­ing these plans re­quire con­sul­ta­tion with in­dus­try, a deep un­der­stand­ing of the in­dus­try and de­tailed mon­i­tor­ing of what’s go­ing on. But it is nec­es­sary grunge work to be done by of­fi­cials who know what is hap­pen­ing on the ground and with an in­sti­tu­tional DNA that sees ev­ery op­por­tu­nity to al­low a for­eigner to work here as an open­ing for a Sin­ga­porean to ac­quire those skills.</p>
    <p>Only when this be­comes sec­ond na­ture in the bu­reau­cracy will Sin­ga­pore truly have an im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy that puts its peo­ple first. It is the mind­set that is more im­por­tant, af­ter which the right poli­cies will fol­low.</p>
    <p>But even this alone may not be enough. Ul­ti­mately, Sin­ga­pore­ans’ angst with the coun­try’s im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy has to do with their own in­se­cu­ri­ties about their liveli­hood, in­clud­ing jobs, stan­dard of liv­ing and re­tire­ment se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The more se­cure they feel, the more open they will be to for­eign­ers. Ob­vi­ously, no govern­ment can guar­an­tee ab­so­lute se­cu­rity, but a coun­try’s so­cial safety net plays a ma­jor role in pro­vid­ing a min­i­mum level of sup­port.</p>
    <p>I was thus glad to hear the PM say the Govern­ment will strengthen this sup­port and that it was not ide­o­log­i­cally op­posed to any so­lu­tion. If in­deed Sin­ga­pore moves in this di­rec­tion, it will help make its im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy more ac­cept­able to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The more so­cial­ist it is on wel­fare, the more cap­i­tal­ist it can be in open­ing its doors.</p>
    <p>Wel­come to the new nor­mal.</p>
