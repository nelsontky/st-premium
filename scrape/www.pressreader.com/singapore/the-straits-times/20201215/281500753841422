    <p>South Korea has shut down schools in Seoul and the sur­round­ing ar­eas and dis­patched hun­dreds of Spe­cial Forces of­fi­cers to sup­port con­tact trac­ing ef­forts, as the gov­ern­ment tight­ened mea­sures amid a third Covid-19 wave that has pushed the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions be­yond 43,000.</p>
    <p>South Korea yesterday re­ported 718 cases, down from Sun­day’s record high of 1,030 cases and Satur­day’s 950 in­fec­tions. But the num­ber is wor­ry­ing as Mon­day’s fig­ures tend to be lower due to fewer tests con­ducted over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have warned that the daily fig­ure could spike to 1,200 if the pace of in­fec­tion does not slow down. The out­break is cur</p>
    <p>rently fu­elled by two ma­jor clus­ters at a restau­rant and a church in Seoul, and nu­mer­ous small clus­ters across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>All ele­men­tary schools and kinder­gartens in Seoul and Greater Seoul will switch to on­line learn­ing from to­day un­til the end of the year. Mid­dle and high schools were or­dered to go on­line since Dec 7.</p>
    <p>The army yesterday sent 379 of­fi­cers from the Spe­cial War­fare Com­mand to 79 pub­lic health cen­tres in the cap­i­tal to sup­port Covid-19 ef­forts for two months, such as con­tact trac­ing and trans­fer­ring virus sam­ples.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Na­tional De­fence also dis­patched 56 mil­i­tary doc­tors and 18 nurses to some of the 150 tem­po­rary test­ing cen­tres to be set up from yesterday.</p>
    <p>Long queues were seen at some of th­ese sites, which of­fer free and anony­mous test­ing.</p>
    <p>Calls have grown for the gov­ern­ment to im­ple­ment the high­est level of its five-tier so­cial dis­tanc­ing sys­tem. Un­der Level 3 – one notch higher than the cur­rent Level 2.5 and to be im­posed when new cases surge to 800 to 1,000 per day – gath­er­ings of 10 or more peo­ple will be banned.</p>
    <p>Non-es­sen­tial fa­cil­i­ties such as movie the­atres and res­tau­rants will be closed and all em­ploy­ees, ex­cept those in es­sen­tial ser­vices, will work from home.</p>
    <p>Over two mil­lion fa­cil­i­ties and busi­nesses will be af­fected, said the Min­istry of Health and Wel­fare.</p>
    <p>Level 3 is a “last re­sort” that “re­quires a care­ful re­view”, Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun said yesterday. Ex­perts have raised con­cerns over the grow­ing trans­mis­sion rate and short­age of hos­pi­tal beds. Over 10,000 con­firmed pa­tients are un­der­go­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>About 500 pa­tients a day are wait­ing at home for ad­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion Agency said the re­pro­duc­tion num­ber is now 1.28, which means each pa­tient in­fects more than one per­son.</p>
    <p>About 3 per cent to 4 per cent of the peo­ple who were tested last week turned out pos­i­tive, which ex­perts say in­di­cates a high rate of trans­mis­sion in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The Seoul city gov­ern­ment will open 18 res­i­den­tial treat­ment cen­tres this week to pro­vide 1,577 beds for pa­tients with mild symp­toms. The city has nine such cen­tres now.</p>
    <p>Five mega churches have also of­fered their fa­cil­i­ties in Greater Seoul to be turned into res­i­den­tial treat­ment cen­tres. This will pro­vide a to­tal of 890 rooms.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some are busy stock­ing up food and other sup­plies. Mr An­drew Kim, 46, who is self-em­ployed, told The Straits Times: “Ev­ery­one is think­ing the same thing – to be pre­pared for the worst.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It’s easy to or­der gro­ceries and food on­line, but you have to pay de­liv­ery fees which we can save for rainy days later.”</p>
