    <p>NEW YORK • Three sep­a­rate storms – two in the At­lantic Ocean and one i n the Pa­cific – have prompted a se­ries of weather warn­ings and watches for some is­lands in the Caribbean and parts of Texas and Hawaii in the US.</p>
    <p>Trop­i­cal Storm Hanna, in the Gulf of Mex­ico, con­tin­ued to strengthen on Fri­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>It was ex­pected to be­come a Cat­e­gory 1 hur­ri­cane, with winds of about 122kmh, when it was set to make land­fall yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>A hur­ri­cane warn­ing was also is­sued for parts of the Cen­tral Texas coast, from Port Mans­field to Mesquite Bay.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials ex­pected storm con­di­tions to reach the Texas coast by yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre also warned of a “lifethreat­en­ing storm surge” along parts of the Texas coast, and heavy rain across southern Texas and north-east­ern Mex­ico that could re­sult in flood­ing.</p>
    <p>“The pri­mary threat from this is go­ing to be rain­fall,” me­te­o­rol­o­gist Den­nis Felt­gen, who is also spokesman for the cen­tre, said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The day be­fore, Texas Gov­er­nor Greg Ab­bott placed nu­mer­ous re­sources on standby in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the storm’s ar­rival.</p>
    <p>By Fri­day, he had started urg­ing res­i­dents to heed guid­ance from lo­cal of­fi­cials and to pre­pare for the storm.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dou­glas, a Cat­e­gory 3 hur­ri­cane, had crossed over from the east­ern Pa­cific Ocean to the cen­tral Pa­cific Ocean on Fri­day, Mr Felt­gen said.</p>
    <p>The storm was still on track to ap­proach Hawaii, he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre, max­i­mum sus­tained winds were around 185kmh, with higher gusts on Fri­day night.</p>
    <p>Hawaii Gov­er­nor David Ige is­sued a pre-land­fall emer­gency proclamati­on last Thurs­day, which au­tho­rised the spend­ing of state funds for quick and ef­fi­cient dis­as­ter re­lief.</p>
    <p>Mr Felt­gen said: “The good news is that the storm is go­ing to grad­u­ally weaken to­day, through the week­end, be­cause it will be track­ing over some cooler wa­ter.”</p>
    <p>Dou­glas was still ex­pected to be at or near hur­ri­cane strength when it ap­proached closer to the east­ern end of the Hawai­ian is­lands by yes­ter­day evening or to­day, he added.</p>
    <p>“And we don’t just fo­cus on the wind. You have to look at the wa­ter im­pacts on this thing as well,” Mr Felt­gen said.</p>
    <p>“Very heavy rain­fall. They could be look­ing at some flash flood­ing and tremen­dously rough surf.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Trop­i­cal Storm Gon­zalo con­tin­ued mov­ing to­wards the Wind­ward Is­lands in the Caribbean on Fri­day af­ter­noon, the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>Mr Felt­gen said it ap­peared that Gon­zalo would not reach hur­ri­cane strength, not­ing that the storm’s winds had de­creased to 72kmh.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment of Bar­ba­dos had can­celled its hur­ri­cane watch for the is­land, the cen­tre said, but a trop­i­cal storm warn­ing re­mained in ef­fect for the area.</p>
    <p>Tobago and Gre­nada were un­der a trop­i­cal storm warn­ing.</p>
