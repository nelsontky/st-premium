    <p>Un­pleas­ant or un­wel­come sit­u­a­tions will arise in our lives. The way we re­act to these is what de­ter­mines the ex­tent of the men­tal pain we ex­pe­ri­ence. The more we re­act in anger, fear or re­sent­ment, the more in­tense the men­tal pain.</p>
    <p>Dis­tress means we are hurt­ing phys­i­cally or men­tally. For most peo­ple, phys­i­cal pain is more bear­able than men­tal pain, which is also known as emo­tional pain.</p>
    <p>Last year, 400 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore took their lives. Most, if not all, com­mit­ted sui­cide to end their men­tal tor­ment. Few would end their lives be­cause of phys­i­cal pain as this can be al­le­vi­ated by med­i­ca­tion. But med­i­ca­tion can­not al­ways help with men­tal pain.</p>
    <p>Thirty-three-year-old Tina was suf­fer­ing from can­cer and en­dured the phys­i­cal pain with mor­phine and fen­tanyl each day so she could spend more time with her three-year-old son.</p>
    <p>She was un­der pal­lia­tive care in a pri­vate hos­pi­tal. When I first vis­ited her on Oct 17 last year, I was told she had only two weeks left as the can­cer had metas­ta­sised. Due to sheer de­ter­mi­na­tion, she lived for an­other two months.</p>
    <p>Tina didn’t com­plain about the phys­i­cal pain nor that life was un­fair. She lived one day at a time, fo­cus­ing on the time she still had with her family. She was just grate­ful that she could live through each day and wake up the next day to see her son again. This would not be easy for most peo­ple unless they had gone through some train­ing on be­ing present.</p>
    <p>She was a stu­dent in my mind­ful­ness-based stress re­duc­tion course. She had asked her pal­lia­tive care doc­tor, who was coin­ci­den­tally my stu­dent from the same course, to con­tact me when she was ad­mit­ted into the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>It was for­tu­nate that she had taken the course – with just a lit­tle prompt­ing, she was able to fo­cus her mind on the present. This helped her to ap­pre­ci­ate the time she still had and feel grate­ful that she had won­der­ful par­ents who would be tak­ing care of her son af­ter she passed on.</p>
    <p>She was also grate­ful to her hus­band for tak­ing good care of her, and her sis­ters for show­ing so much love and care. She was able to ap­ply an­other foun­da­tional at­ti­tude of mind­ful­ness – ac­cep­tance, ac­cept­ing her con­di­tion in­stead of com­plain­ing about it.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one of my vis­its, I fa­cil­i­tated an open con­ver­sa­tion be­tween her and her par­ents and hus­band. This en­abled her to apol­o­gise to her par­ents as she would not be around to look af­ter them as they aged.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther, in turn, apol­o­gised to her for not hav­ing urged her to see a doc­tor ear­lier as she may have been cured if the can­cer was de­tected ear­lier.</p>
    <p>She told her hus­band that he was free to re­marry. She was be­ing very prag­matic. We were all in tears: ev­ery­one was able to speak from their hearts with­out putting on a brave front. That con­ver­sa­tion helped all of them to pre­pare for Tina’s in­evitable death in­stead of pre­tend­ing that she would re­cover. It also en­abled them to talk about their fears, re­grets and the won­der­ful mem­o­ries they shared. They were able to dis­cuss her wishes for her son.</p>
    <p>Not that Tina had no thoughts of self-pity or re­gret. But she did not en­ter­tain these thoughts, so as not to in­dulge in the feel­ings of re­sent­ment and anger. She showed the world what liv­ing in the present was about in the fi­nal weeks of her life.</p>
    <p>Un­pleas­ant or un­wel­come sit­u­a­tions will arise in our lives.</p>
    <p>The way we re­act to these is what de­ter­mines the ex­tent of the men­tal pain we ex­pe­ri­ence. The more we re­act in anger, fear or re­sent­ment, the more in­tense the men­tal pain.</p>
    <p>Our life is bound to hit bumps, like a car hav­ing to go over humps. When the driver knows how to slow down when ap­proach­ing the hump, the af­ter-ef­fects are min­i­mal and the smooth ride re­sumes. If the hump is es­pe­cially big, then paus­ing be­fore rolling over it is much more pleas­ant than speed­ing over it.</p>
    <p>When fac­ing un­wel­come sit­u­a­tions, paus­ing and slow­ing down en­able us to re­flect and choose a bet­ter re­sponse. Re­duc­ing our de­gree of re­ac­tiv­ity helps to pre­vent us from mak­ing sit­u­a­tions worse. By paus­ing, we are able to fo­cus our mind on choos­ing a re­sponse that would bring about bet­ter out­comes.</p>
    <p>Be­cause Tina was able to pause, she could re­fo­cus on what she could do in the limited time she had in­stead of wal­low­ing in sad­ness or anger. She spent the last weeks of her life writ­ing let­ters to her son, let­ters that en­abled her to share her val­ues and ad­vice with him at ev­ery mile­stone of his life.</p>
    <p>She wrote let­ters for her par­ents and hus­band to read to him at each of his birth­days. So, even if she was not go­ing to be with him as he grew up, she was able to leave be­hind her spirit of care and love to sup­port his growing-up jour­ney.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, a fa­ther was an­gry with his teenage son for not want­ing to spend his birth­day with the family. The son pre­ferred to spend his birth­day with his friends.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther was so en­raged, he changed the lock to their home. When his son went home at night, he was un­able to en­ter the home. The son was so hurt that he did not speak to his fa­ther for months.</p>
    <p>The hurt turned into re­sent­ment to­wards his fa­ther as well as him­self.</p>
    <p>The in­tense re­ac­tions by both fa­ther and son re­sulted in years of men­tal an­guish. The son ended up de­pressed, and self-harmed by cut­ting his arms and thighs.</p>
    <p>What if both had paused and slowed down?</p>
    <p>The fa­ther could have sug­gested cel­e­brat­ing his son’s birth­day the next day or one day ear­lier, ac­cept­ing that his son pre­ferred to spend his special day with his friends. The son could have, on the other hand, apol­o­gised to the fa­ther for the hurt his de­ci­sion caused.</p>
    <p>In­stead, both re­acted in­tensely that day, re­sult­ing in years of men­tal pain.</p>
    <p>The son told me that his fa­ther had bought him the lat­est Xbox for his birth­day, but till to­day, the game con­sole has been left un­opened.</p>
    <p>Paus­ing and slow­ing down the mind can help both sides to see things from the other’s per­spec­tive in­stead of re­act­ing by in­flict­ing more pain on the other.</p>
    <p>Mind­ful­ness helps us to be aware of the men­tal tor­ment and ap­ply the heal­ing at­ti­tudes to relieve the men­tal pain. This ap­proach can bring about a bet­ter fu­ture through heal­ing the men­tal pain and pre­cious re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal dis­tress may be in­evitable, but men­tal dis­tress can be a choice.</p>
