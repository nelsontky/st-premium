    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore moves into phase three of its re­open­ing, there are still calls from the var­i­ous authoritie­s for all of us to stay vig­i­lant and not let our guard down.</p>
    <p>Many of the safe man­age­ment mea­sures are still in place, and we are urged to ob­serve and com­ply with them.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, I have ob­served, of late, that the safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and en­force­ment of­fi­cers are them­selves lax in the ex­e­cu­tion of their du­ties. Even worse are those who flout the mea­sures them­selves.</p>
    <p>At Seran­goon Sta­dium, I saw a safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sador who was wear­ing his mask be­low his nos­trils, drink cof­fee and fid­dle with his mobile phone.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral oth­ers gath­ered to chat among them­selves while obliv­i­ous to the situation on the jog­ging track.</p>
    <p>On nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions, I had to re­mind the am­bas­sadors that not all the peo­ple on the track were ex­er­cis­ing.</p>
    <p>Some were merely tak­ing a stroll un­masked.</p>
    <p>I have given feed­back to the staff at the sta­dium but to no avail.</p>
    <p>At shop­ping malls and public ar­eas, some en­force­ment of­fi­cers walk closely in pairs, their eyes fixed on their mobile phones or hav­ing their own con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>It is as if they are go­ing through the mo­tions of pa­trolling the malls.</p>
    <p>I have of­ten seen many peo­ple wear­ing their masks be­low their nos­trils, which is in­cor­rect.</p>
    <p>Yet, some en­force­ment of­fi­cers sim­ply walk past them with­out</p>
    <p>any at­tempt to cor­rect them or is­sue warn­ings to them.</p>
    <p>I urge the authoritie­s to re­mind en­force­ment of­fi­cers to take their du­ties and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties se­ri­ously, so as to en­sure that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are strictly ad­hered to.</p>
    <p>For re­cal­ci­trant of­fend­ers who de­lib­er­ately refuse to com­ply with the mea­sures, they should be is­sued with sum­mons on the spot to en­force com­pli­ance. This will go a long way to­wards keep­ing Sin­ga­pore and ev­ery res­i­dent safe. Christo­pher Teo Kian Lam</p>
