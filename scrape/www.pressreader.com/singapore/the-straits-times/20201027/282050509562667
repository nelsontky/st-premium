    <p>An el­derly tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine (TCM) prac­ti­tioner, who re­port­edly cured a fe­male pa­tient of her per­sis­tent cough af­ter a mas­sage ses­sion in Septem­ber 2018, al­legedly mo­lested the woman when she con­sulted him again the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>Lim Ah Bah is also ac­cused of ask­ing her lewd ques­tions about her sex life, a dis­trict court heard yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 74-year-old Sin­ga­porean, who worked at the Xin Hua TCM Clinic in Tan­jong Pa­gar, is claim­ing trial to two counts each of mo­lest­ing the woman and in­sult­ing her mod­esty. The woman, now 41, works as a man­ager. She can­not be named ow­ing to a gag order to pro­tect her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>She took the stand yes­ter­day – the first day of Lim’s trial – and told Dis­trict Judge Christo­pher Goh that she trusts only TCM treat­ments. She tes­ti­fied that she went to Xin Hua TCM Clinic on Sept 24, 2018. A fe­male ther­a­pist mas­saged her.</p>
    <p>The al­leged vic­tim added that as she had a per­sis­tent cough, the ther­a­pist sug­gested that she also see Lim that day.</p>
    <p>The woman did as she was told and the court heard that af­ter tak­ing her blood pres­sure, Lim claimed that there were a lot of “block­ages” in her body.</p>
    <p>She then agreed to let him mas­sage her torso and tes­ti­fied that her coughs usu­ally took three months to clear.</p>
    <p>She added: “To my sur­prise, he man­aged to cure me within three days... (I had) no more cough.”</p>
    <p>The woman saw Lim again on Oct 1, 2018. She tes­ti­fied that on that oc­ca­sion, he asked her about her sex life.</p>
    <p>She said that Lim also sug­gested that her boyfriend per­form a sex act on her to clear her “block­age”.</p>
    <p>The woman told Judge Goh: “I felt very of­fended... This was a very pri­vate thing.”</p>
    <p>De­spite this, she al­lowed Lim to mas­sage her. She said that Lim mo­lested her af­ter that.</p>
    <p>When Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Claire Poh asked the woman what was go­ing through her mind at the time, she replied: “I just felt this treat­ment was very weird and pe­cu­liar... Nor­mally, my cough could take three months to cure... I be­lieved him as a doc­tor.”</p>
    <p>The woman tes­ti­fied that Lim then mas­saged her be­fore per­form­ing other pro­ce­dures in­clud­ing acupunc­ture. He al­legedly mo­lested her for the sec­ond time soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>The court heard that she then told him to stop and the ses­sion ended.</p>
    <p>The trial re­sumes to­mor­row.</p>
