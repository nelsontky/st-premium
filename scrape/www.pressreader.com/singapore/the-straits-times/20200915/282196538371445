    <p>TAIPEI • Tai­wan sits squarely in the middle of the wors­en­ing dis­pute be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton, with many of its com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing fac­to­ries in China that are man­u­fac­tur­ing for Amer­i­can com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Those ten­sions are push­ing Tai­wanese com­pa­nies to re­lo­cate some pro­duc­tion back home and also re­di­rect money to fac­to­ries on their side of the strait.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s gov­ern­ment has helped with tax breaks and other sup­port, and that in­vest­ment has cush­ioned some of the blow from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary l ast year, more than NT$1.1 tril­lion (S$51 bil­lion) of Tai­wanese in­vest­ment has come back, Eco­nomic Af­fairs Min­is­ter Wang Mei-hua said last week, with tech man­u­fac­tur­ers in­clud­ing In­nolux, Ac­c­ton Tech­nol­ogy and</p>
    <p>Quanta Com­puter build­ing new fac­to­ries in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Sup­ply chains for elec­tric ve­hi­cle man­u­fac­tur­ers in­clud­ing Tesla, which has a factory in Shang­hai, are also mov­ing to set up in Tai­wan, she told mem­bers of the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce and their Tai­wanese coun­ter­parts, tout­ing the fruits of the gov­ern­ment’s pol­icy to bring man­u­fac­tur­ing and in­vest­ment back.</p>
    <p>The moves by Tai­wanese com­pa­nies are in con­trast with those of United States firms, which have not re­sponded to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s calls to re­turn home.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ris­ing dis­trust of China is lead­ing Amer­i­can firms to move their sup­ply chains else­where, with Ms Wang say­ing that the main driver for com­pa­nies re­turn­ing to Tai­wan is in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty con­cerns from US cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“It’s up­stream com­pa­nies that de­ter­mine the di­rec­tion of Tai­wanese in­vest­ment,” said Mr Roy Chun Lee, deputy ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Tai­wan WTO & RTA Cen­tre at the Chung-Hua In­sti­tu­tion for Eco­nomic Re­search. “The gen­eral trend is the cre­ation of a sec­ond­track sup­ply chain that is less re­liant on China.”</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is Wistron NeWeb, which an­nounced a new NT$2.7 bil­lion in­vest­ment in a Tai­wan factory in June, after its cus­tomers re­quested it to di­ver­sify where it man­u­fac­tures. The firm makes routers and other wire­less gear, and counts AT&T and HP among its big­gest clients, ac­cord­ing to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, Tai­wan’s Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen launched a three-year pro­gramme to en­cour­age Tai­wanese busi­nesses with op­er­a­tions abroad to repa­tri­ate man­u­fac­tur­ing and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>After an ini­tial surge, the pace of re­turn­ing in­vest­ment has slowed this year, with some of that likely due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There has also been a shift in sec­tors from in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, which dom­i­nated last year, with in­vest­ment in com­pound ma­te­ri­als and auto parts and com­po­nents ris­ing, ac­cord­ing to Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>In an­other shift, it is not j ust Amer­i­can end clients who are push­ing com­pa­nies back home to Tai­wan’s skilled labour pool and highly de­vel­oped sup­ply net­work.</p>
    <p>“Euro­pean com­pa­nies are now be­gin­ning to fol­low their Amer­i­can coun­ter­parts and rec­om­mend­ing that their sup­pli­ers di­ver­sify away from China,” Mr Lee said.</p>
    <p>“Ris­ing pro­duc­tion costs in China are an is­sue, and there is also a cost as­so­ci­ated with the po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty there, in­clud­ing the in­creas­ingly strained ties be­tween China and the Euro­pean Union.”</p>
