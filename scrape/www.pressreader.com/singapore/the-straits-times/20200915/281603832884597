    <p>Indonesian cap­i­tal Jakarta kicked off a sec­ond shut­down yes­ter­day in a bid to slow the surge of new coro­n­avirus cases. The re­stric­tions, which will re­main in place for two weeks, are less strin­gent than the city’s first lock­down in April, with non-essen­tial busi­nesses al­lowed to op­er­ate and malls and mar­kets re­main­ing open sub­ject to com­pli­ance with health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>A two-week, less re­stric­tive lock­down was im­posed on the Indonesian cap­i­tal yes­ter­day, in a last­ditch at­tempt by the coun­try to curb the rapidly surg­ing num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The new move is un­like the largescale lock­down in April, when only com­pa­nies in 11 essen­tial sec­tors – in­clud­ing food, health, en­ergy and fi­nance – were al­lowed to op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Now, com­pa­nies in non-essen­tial sec­tors can con­tinue to op­er­ate on con­di­tion that only 25 per cent of their em­ploy­ees work in of­fices. The rest have to work from home. Places of wor­ship lo­cated in lowrisk neigh­bour­hoods will also be al­lowed to stay open, but at 50 per cent of ca­pac­ity, while malls and mar­kets can con­tinue to op­er­ate by ad­her­ing to health pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Din­ing-in is still pro­hib­ited in restau­rants, and all en­ter­tain­ment venues are closed.</p>
    <p>Dr Anies Baswedan, Jakarta’s Gov­er­nor, de­cided on the par­tial lock­down al­though In­done­sia’s se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and the busi­ness com­mu­nity op­posed the re­stric­tive mea­sures, say­ing it will hurt the econ­omy and liveli­hood of many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But Dr Anies said on Sun­day that the Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion saw the ur­gency in re-im­pos­ing the so­cial re­stric­tions to re­duce the num­ber of cases and deaths, which has soared this month.</p>
    <p>From Sept 1 to 11, there were 3,864 fresh cases, ac­count­ing for 25 per cent of to­tal con­firmed cases in the city in the past six months.</p>
    <p>The death tally in the same pe­riod made up 14 per cent of the over­all fa­tal­i­ties in Jakarta so far.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion has put mount­ing pres­sure on Jakarta’s Covid-19 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals to focus on man­ag­ing pa­tients in need of iso­la­tion and in­ten­sive care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Anies also noted a large num­ber of in­fec­tions emerg­ing from of­fices. “This is why our focus on the re­stric­tions start­ing from Sept 14 is of­fices,” he said, adding that an en­tire of­fice build­ing will be shut for three days should there be one con­firmed case.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, the city of 10 mil­lion had re­ported 55,099 cases and 1,418 deaths, while the en­tire coun­try recorded 221,523 cases and 8,841 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Sar­man Si­man­jo­rang, the deputy chair­man of the ad­vi­sory coun­cil at the Jakarta chap­ter of the Indonesian Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try, told The Straits Times that busi­nesses are will­ing to com­ply with workplace rules, al­though the so­cial re­stric­tions that put a lid on eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties will be hard on them.</p>
    <p>“As the move­ment of peo­ple is curbed, eco­nomic trans­ac­tions will cer­tainly de­cline. It will im­pact us,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Mi­cro, small and medium en­ter­prises, which were try­ing to re­cover after the first so­cial re­stric­tions were eased, will fall again.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sar­man said the im­pact of the sec­ond lock­down will be re­flected in the city’s eco­nomic growth in the third quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>Jakarta’s econ­omy con­tracted by 8.22 per cent in the April-June pe­riod com­pared with the same quar­ter a year ago. It had grown by 5.06 per cent in the first quar­ter of this year, of­fi­cial fig­ures show.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the coun­try’s econ­omy shrank by 5.32 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. It is the first quar­terly contractio­n since 1999.</p>
    <p>Stiffer penal­ties have been in­tro­duced this time round.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who do not mask up will be fined 250,000 ru­piah (S$23), and dou­ble that for sub­se­quent vi­o­la­tions. Com­pa­nies will be shut down for three days on their first vi­o­la­tion, fined 50 mil­lion ru­piah the sec­ond time and dou­ble the amount after that.</p>
    <p>“We hope the (city) gov­ern­ment will en­force the so­cial re­stric­tions strictly and re­ally im­pose penal­ties,” said Mr Sar­man.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion ac­ti­vated eight points across the Indonesian cap­i­tal where of­fi­cials will mon­i­tor the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the re­stric­tions.</p>
