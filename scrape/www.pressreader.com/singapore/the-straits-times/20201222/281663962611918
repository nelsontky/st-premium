    <p>Se­cond­ing work­ers to com­pa­nies in other sec­tors that are far­ing bet­ter amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is one of the ways in which em­ploy­ers in strug­gling sec­tors can re­tain tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at The Straits Times’ Re­set we­bi­nar on job losses and op­por­tu­ni­ties in 2021 yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) pres­i­dent Robert Yap said that in the case of em­ploy­ees with unique skill sets, com­pa­nies may not be able to af­ford to em­ploy them when they are badly hit.</p>
    <p>How­ever, th­ese skills may be needed when the sec­tor re­cov­ers, and by se­cond­ing them to an­other in­dus­try, firms are able to re­tain th­ese skilled work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Some of th­ese sec­tors will def­i­nitely re­turn, it’s just a mat­ter of time... It’s just that it’d be longer than nor­mal be­cause they are hit quite badly,” said Mr Yap, as he urged em­ploy­ers to think about the “sur­ro­gate con­cept” of sec­ond­ments.</p>
    <p>In do­ing so, said labour chief Ng Chee Meng, com­pa­nies are not only ad­dress­ing their own in­ter­ests but also Sin­ga­pore’s broader in­ter­ests by help­ing to pre­serve lo­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He cited how a for­eign multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tion has been in touch with the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) to see how lo­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the de­pressed aerospace sec­tor may be re­tained.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng out­lined how en­gi­neers and tech­ni­cians, for ex­am­ple, could be sec­onded to other sec­tors which are cur­rently do­ing bet­ter than aerospace.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there could be an ar­range­ment whereby the sec­onded worker re­turns to his orig­i­nal em­ployer to keep up to date with the work, and there could be other agree­ments be­tween the two em­ploy­ers to share the worker’s wage, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap and Mr Ng also spoke about “queen bee” projects, where a com­pany that is the in­dus­try leader in a par­tic­u­lar sec­tor, such as re­tail or lo­gis­tics, could take the lead on trans­for­ma­tion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, an in­dus­try leader that has trans­formed its op­er­a­tions by dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion could spur its sub-con­trac­tor part­ners to do the same, and trig­ger wide­spread change. This would speed up a process which could other­wise be a la­bo­ri­ous, top-down ef­fort from or­gan­i­sa­tions like NTUC and SNEF.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng noted that the queen bee, while tak­ing on a lead­er­ship role, would not be a sin­gle, dom­i­nant player but rather one that part­ners with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he also ac­knowl­edged that in push­ing bound­aries and pur­su­ing in­no­va­tion, there is in­evitably some level of un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>“It comes back to my point, whether it’s to em­ploy­ers or work­ers – the ac­cep­tance that the world has changed, to adapt to the new world, to adopt and to take nec­es­sary ac­tions, and some­times... to deal with the un­cer­tainty and the anx­i­ety as well,” Mr Ng said.</p>
