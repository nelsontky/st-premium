    <p>The slide in Sin­ga­pore’s core con­sumer prices eased last month on smaller de­clines in the cost of ser­vices, re­tail and other goods, as well as elec­tric­ity and gas. Core in­fla­tion came in at mi­nus 0.3 per cent last month, up from mi­nus 0.4 per cent in July. It was the sev­enth straight month of core con­sumer prices falling be­low prices dur­ing the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>The slide in Sin­ga­pore’s core con­sumer prices eased last month on smaller de­clines in the cost of ser­vices, re­tail and other goods, as well as elec­tric­ity and gas.</p>
    <p>Core in­fla­tion, which ex­cludes ac­com­mo­da­tion and pri­vate road trans­port costs, came in at mi­nus 0.3 per cent last month, up from the decade low of mi­nus 0.4 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>It was the sev­enth straight month of core con­sumer prices falling be­low prices dur­ing the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, over­all in­fla­tion was un­changed at mi­nus 0.4 per cent, as a steeper fall in pri­vate trans­port costs off­set the more mod­er­ate de­cline in core in­fla­tion, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) and the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Barclays Bank economist Brian Tan said the gen­tler de­cline in core in­fla­tion is in line with a grad­ual re­cov­ery in the Covid-19-hit econ­omy. “That said, the fact that prices are still un­der­wa­ter sug­gests the econ­omy re­mains un­der sig­nif­i­cant pres­sure and far from pre-coro­n­avirus lev­els,” he added.</p>
    <p>The in­fla­tion data showed pri­vate trans­port costs fell at a faster yearon-year pace of 2.3 per cent last month, com­pared with the 2.1 per cent drop in July, on lower car price in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>The cost of re­tail and other goods recorded a smaller de­cline of mi­nus 1.3 per cent last month, com­pared with mi­nus 1.6 per cent the month be­fore, as the prices of cloth­ing and footwear and recre­ational goods fell at a more mod­er­ate pace.</p>
    <p>The cost of elec­tric­ity and gas also de­clined at a slower rate last month, at mi­nus 14.6 per cent com­pared with mi­nus 15.2 per cent in July, as the take-up of new sub­scrip­tions un­der the Open Elec­tric­ity Mar­ket eased.</p>
    <p>Food in­fla­tion fell last month, with prices ris­ing 1.8 per cent com­pared with 2.2 per cent the pre­vi­ous month, owing to lower non-cooked food and food ser­vice in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­mo­da­tion in­fla­tion was un­changed at 0.4 per cent as hous­ing rents saw a sim­i­lar pace of in­crease as in July.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice costs fell at a slower pace of 0.5 per cent last month com­pared with the 0.8 per cent drop the pre­vi­ous month, be­cause of a smaller fall in point-to-point trans­port ser­vice costs and a larger in­crease in telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions ser­vice fees.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing economist Song Seng Wun said that although prices for ser­vices and some con­sumer items fell at a slower pace last month – per­haps owing to im­proved do­mes­tic de­mand af­ter cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were eased – the sub­dued macro out­look and weaker labour mar­ket con­di­tions will con­tinue to ex­ert down­ward pres­sure on prices for dis­cre­tionary goods and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI noted that in the quar­ters ahead, ex­ter­nal sources of in­fla­tion are likely to re­main be­nign amid weak global de­mand con­di­tions. “Oil prices are ex­pected to stay low for an ex­tended pe­riod, while in­ter­na­tional food com­mod­ity price in­creases should gen­er­ally be con­tained amid im­proved sup­ply con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“Do­mes­ti­cally, sub­dued eco­nomic sen­ti­ment and weak labour mar­ket con­di­tions will dampen con­sumer de­mand, thereby keep­ing price in­creases for most dis­cre­tionary goods and ser­vices low. The ac­cu­mu­la­tion of spare ca­pac­ity in the econ­omy will also curb over­all cost pres­sures.”</p>
    <p>MAS and MTI kept their full-year fore­casts for both core in­fla­tion and over­all in­fla­tion at be­tween mi­nus 1 per cent and 0 per cent.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank economist Barn­abas Gan said the bank is keep­ing its full-year head­line and core in­fla­tion fore­casts at mi­nus 0.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The mix of falling do­mes­tic and tourism-led de­mand cou­pled with low oil prices for the rest of the year are for­mi­da­ble head­winds against con­sumer prices,” he said.</p>
