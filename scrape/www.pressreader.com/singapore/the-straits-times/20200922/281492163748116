    <p>Award-win­ning writer Zadie Smith, sem­i­nal graphic nov­el­ist Art Spiegel­man and sci­ence-fic­tion trail­blazer Liu Cixin are among the lit­er­ary stars head­lin­ing this year’s Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val (SWF).</p>
    <p>It has also drawn not one but two Pulitzer Prize-win­ning po­ets from the United States – Sharon Olds and Tracy K. Smith.</p>
    <p>Early-bird tick­ets went on sale yes­ter­day for the 23rd edi­tion of the an­nual fes­ti­val, or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val will run from Oct 30 to Nov 8 in its first fully dig­i­tal edi­tion due to Covid-19. The dig­i­tal fes­ti­val pass will give ac­cess to more than 130 pro­grammes, in­clud­ing head­lin­ers.</p>
    <p>Its theme this year is In­ti­macy. Fes­ti­val di­rec­tor Pooja Nansi, 38, hopes that in its most so­cially dis­tant edi­tion ever, it will get peo­ple think­ing about what it means to have hu­man con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We can’t re­ally ex­pe­ri­ence arts and cul­ture sit­ting in a room as bod­ies to­gether,” she says over Zoom. “How does that af­fect the in­ti­macy of the ex­pe­ri­ence be­tween writ­ers and readers, be­tween per­form­ers and au­di­ences?”</p>
    <p>Ms Nansi, who is in her sec­ond year at the fes­ti­val’ s helm, de­scribed it as “same same, but dif­fer­ent”.</p>
    <p>When it be­came clear in March that the Covid-19 out­break would make it nigh im­pos­si­ble to pull off a phys­i­cal fes­ti­val this year, she and her team be­gan con­cep­tu­al­is­ing what a dig­i­tal fes­ti­val might look like.</p>
    <p>While they have had to re­think fes­ti­val con­tent and en­sure au­di­ences such as se­niors are not left out in the shift on­line, Ms Nansi says new op­por­tu­ni­ties have un­folded in the dig­i­tal sphere.</p>
    <p>They were able to fea­ture au­thors who might not oth­er­wise have been able to travel here and ex­plore new ways in which Sin­ga­pore lit­er­a­ture could ex­ist on­line.</p>
    <p>“There are play-your-own-ad­ven­ture games, there are com­mis­sions that have delved into aug­mented re­al­ity and vir­tual re­al­ity, which I don’t know that we would oth­er­wise have ur­gently felt com­pelled to do.”</p>
    <p>She says the works of this year’s head­lin­ers “re­ally il­lu­mi­nate this strange ten­sion be­tween feel­ing iso­lated and want­ing to be con­nected, and in some ways be more con­nected”.</p>
    <p>Smith, who is Bri­tish, is ac­claimed for nov­els such as her de­but White Teeth (2000) and On Beauty (2005), with which she won the Or­ange Prize for Fic­tion.</p>
    <p>She re­cently re­leased a col­lec­tion of es­says, In­ti­ma­tions, re­flect­ing on the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can car­toon­ist Spiegel­man is best known for his Holo­caust nar­ra­tive Maus (1980 to 1991), the first graphic novel to re­ceive a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
    <p>Liu pro­pelled Chi­nese sci­ence fic­tion onto the world stage when Ken Liu’s English trans­la­tion of his novel, The Three-Body Prob­lem, won the 2015 Hugo Award.</p>
    <p>The SWF Youth Fringe for those aged 13 to 18 re­turns for a sec­ond year, with Amer­i­can au­thor Cas­san­dra Clare, who wrote young adult fan­tasy se­ries The Mor­tal In­stru­ments (2007 to 2014), as one of the head­lin­ers.</p>
    <p>This year’s Youth Fringe, cu­rated by a stu­dent panel in part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Book Coun­cil, will look at how peo­ple re­late to the In­ter­net, from the power of in­flu­encers to so­cial jus­tice move­ments.</p>
    <p>The Arts House, where the fes­ti­val is typ­i­cally head­quar­tered, will trans­form this year into a ra­dio sta­tion with Night Spin 182.7, a se­ries of pod­casts and vod­casts.</p>
    <p>Fes­ti­val­go­ers will get a chance to en­ter the strange uni­verse of spec­u­la­tive fic­tion au­thor Vic­tor Fer­nando R. Ocampo in Play This Story: The Book Of Red Shad­ows, an in­ter­ac­tive psy­cho­log­i­cal hor­ror game that takes place over e-mail.</p>
    <p>This year’s fes­ti­val will recog­nise three Tamil lit­er­ary pi­o­neers – P. Kr­ish­nan, Rama Kannabi­ran and Sin­gai Ma Elangkan­nan – in a dig­i­tal ex­hi­bi­tion. It is the first time it is hon­our­ing not one but three pi­o­neers in a year.</p>
    <p>Ms Nansi says that while the team knows it can­not repli­cate the ex­pe­ri­ence of past phys­i­cal fes­ti­vals, it still aims to cre­ate a sense of community for fes­ti­val­go­ers.</p>
    <p>“So much of what we have grown to love about the fes­ti­val is just be­ing on fes­ti­val grounds, bump­ing into each other and say­ing hi and eat­ing tacos from the truck,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Which we can still do. You can or­der the tacos at home. But we want to still have that sense of community, even though it’s in the dig­i­tal sphere.”</p>
