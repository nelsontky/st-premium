    <p>A to­tal of 222 peo­ple are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for loan-shark­ing ac­tiv­i­ties af­ter be­ing nabbed dur­ing a two-week po­lice blitz that ended on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The sus­pects are aged be­tween 15 and 77, the po­lice said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice crackdown be­gan on Oct 26, dur­ing which of­fi­cers from the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment and the seven po­lice land di­vi­sions con­ducted si­mul­ta­ne­ous raids at nu­mer­ous lo­ca­tions all over the is­land.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that nine of the sus­pects had al­legedly con­ducted ha­rass­ment at the homes of debtors, and 27 sus­pects are be­lieved to be run­ners who had as­sisted the loan sharks by car­ry­ing out au­to­mated teller ma­chine (ATM) trans­fers, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 186 sus­pects are be­lieved to have opened bank ac­counts and given away their ATM cards, PIN num­bers and/or In­ter­net bank­ing to­kens to loan sharks to fa­cil­i­tate un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said loan sharks are in­creas­ingly turn­ing to send­ing unso</p>
    <p>licited l oan ad­ver­tise­ments via text mes­sages or on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>They warned mem­bers of the pub­lic not to re­ply or re­spond to such ad­ver­tise­ments and in­stead re­port the What­sApp mes­sages as spam.</p>
    <p>Those who know of or are sus­pi­cious of any­one who could be in­volved in il­le­gal loan-shark­ing ac</p>
    <p>tiv­i­ties can call the po­lice on 999 or the X-Ah Long hotline on 1800-924-5664.</p>
    <p>The po­lice will con­tinue to take tough en­force­ment ac­tion against those in­volved in the loan-shark­ing busi­ness re­gard­less of their roles, and they will “face the full brunt of the law”, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Moneylen­ders’ Act (Re­vised Edi­tion 2010), when a bank ac­count, ATM card or In­ter­net bank­ing to­ken of any per­son is used to fa­cil­i­tate mon­eylend­ing by an un­li­censed money­len­der, that per­son is pre­sumed to have as­sisted in car­ry­ing out the busi­ness of un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing.</p>
    <p>First-time of­fend­ers found guilty of car­ry­ing out or as­sist­ing in a busi­ness of un­li­censed mon­eylend­ing face a fine of be­tween $30,000 and $300,000, jail of up to four years and are also li­able to face up to six strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>First-time of­fend­ers found guilty of act­ing on be­half of an un­li­censed money­len­der, com­mit­ting or at­tempt­ing to com­mit any acts of ha­rass­ment face a fine of be­tween $5,000 and $50,000, jail of up to five years, and shall also be li­able to face be­tween three and six strokes of the cane.</p>
