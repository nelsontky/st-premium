    <p>•</p>
    <p>Res­cuers raced to search for sur­vivors amid strong af­ter­shocks after Croa­tia’s worst earth­quake i n 140 years killed seven peo­ple and dev­as­tated cities and towns in one of the na­tion’s poor­est re­gions.</p>
    <p>The 6.4-mag­ni­tude tremor on Tues­day dam­aged most build­ings near its epi­cen­tre in Petrinja, a town of 25,000 peo­ple, ren­der­ing their in­hab­i­tants home­less.</p>
    <p>The vic­tims in­cluded a 13-yearold girl, and a father and son. Twenty-six peo­ple were in­jured.</p>
    <p>The tem­blor, which rat­tled Euro­peans as far away as Rome and Vi­enna, was more pow­er­ful than a 5.2 quake on Mon­day and a sim­i­lar-sized tremor that hit the cap­i­tal of Za­greb in March.</p>
    <p>Af­ter­shocks, in­clud­ing two mea­sur­ing 4.8 and 4.6, hit the area be­fore dawn yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to the Euro­pean-Mediter­ranean Seis­mo­log­i­cal Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“This morn­ing we were hit by the third, if not the fourth earth­quake,” Petrinja Mayor Darinko Dum­bovic said on state TV. “Every­thing that has not yet fallen is fall­ing from the ru­ins of Petrinja.”</p>
    <p>The dis­as­ter adds to an al­ready dif­fi­cult year for the Adri­atic Euro­pean Union mem­ber state, which is still busy re­pair­ing the 20,000 build­ings dam­aged in the March quake while tack­ling one of the bloc’s worst Covid-19 surges and a record eco­nomic re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>While the govern­ment lifted a virus-trig­gered ban on move­ment be­tween coun­ties so those whose homes were de­stroyed could stay with rel­a­tives, Croa­t­ian Prime Min</p>
    <p>is­ter An­drej Plenkovic urged peo­ple to con­tinue fol­low­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>“We are ap­peal­ing to peo­ple to stick to epi­demi­o­log­i­cal mea­sures,” he said. “We still have a prob­lem with the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The authoritie­s evac­u­ated the dam­aged hospi­tal in nearby Sisak, the re­gion’s largest city, tak­ing pa­tients to Za­greb. Build­ings were also dam­aged in the cap­i­tal, about 50km away.</p>
    <p>The United States Ge­o­log­i­cal Sur­vey said the tem­blor was the na­tion’s strong­est since the ad­vent of mod­ern seis­mic tools, which be­gan to gain preva­lence in the 1880s.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment has set aside an ini­tial 120 mil­lion kuna (S$26 mil­lion) in re­lief funds, Mr Plenkovic said. Both Hun­gary and Slove­nia said they were send­ing sup­port.</p>
