    <p>In 2013, Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia agreed to build a 350km high­speed rail (HSR) line be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore that would have cut trav­el­ling time to 90 min­utes, com­pared with more than four hours by car.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries an­nounced yes­ter­day in a joint state­ment that the HSR has been ter­mi­nated, af­ter an agree­ment could not be reached on changes pro­posed by Malaysia by the dead­line of Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Here is a time­line of key mile­stones in the now-de­funct project.</p>
    <p>FEB 19, 2013</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and then Malaysian PM Na­jib Razak agree to build a high-speed rail link be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore af­ter meet­ing at the Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia Lead­ers’ Re­treat in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>OCT 9, 2015</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia jointly launch a re­quest for in­for­ma­tion for the high-speed rail project.</p>
    <p>JULY 19, 2016</p>
    <p>PM Lee and Na­jib wit­ness the sign­ing of a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing for the HSR.</p>
    <p>DEC 13, 2016</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia sign a legally bind­ing bi­lat­eral agree­ment to build the new rail line, with a tar­get to have trains run­ning by Dec 31, 2026. The HSR is hailed as a “mar­quee project”.</p>
    <p>DEC 20, 2017</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia call an in­ter­na­tional joint ten­der for an as­sets com­pany that will be responsibl­e for de­sign­ing, build­ing, fi­nanc­ing and main­tain­ing all rolling stock as well as rail as­sets for the HSR.</p>
    <p>MAY 28, 2018</p>
    <p>New Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, whose coali­tion de­feated Na­jib’s in the May elec­tion, says the coun­try has made “a fi­nal de­ci­sion” to drop plans for the HSR.</p>
    <p>He says the project would cost Malaysia RM110 bil­lion (S$36 bil­lion) and will not earn it a sin­gle cent.</p>
    <p>JUNE 11, 2018</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir back­tracks on his ear­lier com­ments, and says the HSR is tem­po­rar­ily shelved due to its high costs.</p>
    <p>SEPT 5, 2018</p>
    <p>Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore sign an agree­ment to post­pone work on the HSR for about two years, up to May 31, 2020. The HSR is now ex­pected to com­mence by Jan 1, 2031.</p>
    <p>Un­der the deal, Malaysia agrees to re­im­burse Sin­ga­pore $15 mil­lion by end-Jan­uary 2019 for abortive costs in­curred by the de­fer­ment of the mega project.</p>
    <p>The de­fer­ment also sees both sides call off the on­go­ing in­ter­na­tional joint ten­der for the as­sets com­pany.</p>
    <p>MAY 31, 2020</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore agrees to fur­ther sus­pend the HSR project for seven more months till the end of the year. Then Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan says the Repub­lic agreed to Malaysia’s re­quest in the spirit of bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>NOV 26, 2020</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trans­port says Malaysia has pro­posed changes to the HSR, and Sin­ga­pore has been dis­cussing them in good faith.</p>
    <p>DEC 2, 2020</p>
    <p>PM Lee and new Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin dis­cuss the project via video­con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>JAN 1, 2021</p>
    <p>The HSR project is ter­mi­nated, af­ter both coun­tries fail to reach an agree­ment on changes pro­posed by Malaysia by the dead­line of Dec 31.</p>
