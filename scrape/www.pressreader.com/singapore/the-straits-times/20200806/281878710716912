    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s po­lice chief in­sisted yes­ter­day that in­ves­ti­ga­tions into an Al Jazeera doc­u­men­tary are be­ing con­ducted “pro­fes­sion­ally” and re­jected con­cerns about wors­en­ing me­dia free­dom, a day af­ter the broad­caster’s of­fice was searched.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the news net­work’s pro­gramme “Locked up in Malaysia’s Lock­down”, af­ter the gov­ern­ment was an­gered by its crit­i­cal look at the treat­ment of mi­grant work­ers amid Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials on Tues­day searched the Qatar-based broad­caster’s Kuala Lumpur of­fice and seized two com­put­ers, spark­ing fresh anger from Al Jazeera and rights groups, and adding to con­cerns about me­dia in­de­pen­dence in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>But the coun­try’s In­spec­tor-Gen­eral of Po­lice Hamid Bador said the search by po­lice and com­mu­ni­ca­tions min­istry of­fi­cials was car­ried out “very pro­fes­sion­ally”.</p>
    <p>“It was not a mil­i­tary kind of ac­tion taken by the po­lice,” he told Agence France-Presse in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>He added that Al Jazeera staff were “in­formed ear­lier of our in­tent to be there. They were even asked which de­vices were used. They co­op­er­ated”.</p>
    <p>Seven Al Jazeera jour­nal­ists were ques­tioned by po­lice last month in con­nec­tion with the doc­u­men­tary. Malaysia in­sists the doc­u­men­tary – which fo­cused on al­leged mis­treat­ment of mi­grants when they were rounded up in May – tar­nished the coun­try’s im­age. The au­thor­i­ties say the round-up was nec­es­sary to pro­tect the pub­lic from the virus. Al Jazeera is be­ing probed for al­leged sedi­tion, defama­tion and trans­mit­ting of­fen­sive con­tent, but it has stood by the doc­u­men­tary and in­sists the re­port­ing was im­par­tial.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Malaysia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein said the raid has not af­fected bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>“We have not re­ceived any re­port on the act (of raid­ing Al Jazeera’s of­fice), it has not af­fected our ties with any coun­try,” he told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
