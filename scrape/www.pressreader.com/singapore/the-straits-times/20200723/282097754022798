    <p>When he was elected in 2011, some naysay­ers branded Dr Chia Shi-Lu an “in­stant MP”. The or­thopaedic sur­geon was a last-minute Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) can­di­date for the gen­eral elec­tion, after Mr Steve Tan abruptly with­drew his can­di­dacy on Nom­i­na­tion Day.</p>
    <p>Then Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC MP Baey Yam Keng was moved to Tampines GRC to re­place Mr Tan, and Dr Chia took Mr Baey’s place.</p>
    <p>Overnight, Dr Chia went from be­ing on the re­serve list to be­com­ing an MP, after the PAP saw a walkover in Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back on his time in pol­i­tics, the two-term MP re­called how he had to work dou­bly hard to win res­i­dents’ trust.</p>
    <p>“Most can­di­dates would have been on the ground for one or two years be­fore be­ing elected, but I had to com­press all of that work into a very short time,” said Dr Chia, 48, who was in the grass­roots in Alju­nied GRC prior to the move.</p>
    <p>Over nine years as an MP, he has be­come a fa­mil­iar face.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest chal­lenges Dr Chia faced was strik­ing a balance be­tween pre­serv­ing “all th­ese his­tor­i­cal el­e­ments of Queen­stown, and yet re­build­ing them so that new life can be in­jected”.</p>
    <p>Even as he lob­bied for new flats to be built so that young peo­ple could live near their par­ents, he also backed a con­ser­va­tion pa­per launched by res­i­dents to pre­serve 18 his­tor­i­cally sig­nif­i­cant sites in the area, in­clud­ing Queen­stown Pub­lic Li­brary.</p>
    <p>Dr Chia is a se­nior con­sul­tant at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal, and many of his pa­tients also hap­pen to be his res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>His first-hand knowl­edge of the prob­lems his pa­tients face prompted him to speak up on a myr­iad of health­care is­sues.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­cluded health­care fi­nanc­ing, sup­port for care­givers, as well as the re­moval of gen­der dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion in pre­mi­ums for the CareShield Life long-term care in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Dr Chia was on the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Health, and chaired it from 2014.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed the roll-out of the MediShield Life in­sur­ance scheme and Pioneer Gen­er­a­tion Pack­age as high points. “I thought health­care sup­port for the el­derly was quite frag­mented in the past, and I was glad we recog­nised the need to give them more health ben­e­fits.”</p>
    <p>Dr Chia, who has a girl­friend but is not mar­ried, plans to spend more time with friends and family, on top of vol­un­teer­ing with sports and com­mu­nity groups.</p>
    <p>He said he will miss his res­i­dents, who will now be un­der the care of his suc­ces­sor, former pub­lic ser­vant Eric Chua Swee Leong, 41.</p>
    <p>“It makes you emo­tional when you talk to (the res­i­dents), and they re­mem­ber lit­tle things that you did for them years ago... That’s the grat­i­fy­ing part (of serv­ing),” he said.</p>
