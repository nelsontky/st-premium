    <p>It will be harder for dodgy op­er­a­tors to work in the fi­nance in­dus­try un­der pro­pos­als announced yes­ter­day that also look at ways to re­duce risks stem­ming from the greater use of tech­nol­ogy in the sec­tor. A new Act would en­able the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore (MAS) to ex­pand its pow­ers to is­sue pro­hi­bi­tion or­ders to de­ter mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>It will be harder for dodgy op­er­a­tors to work in the fi­nance in­dus­try un­der pro­pos­als announced yes­ter­day that also look at ways to re­duce risks stem­ming from the greater use of tech­nol­ogy in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed re­forms, out­lined in a con­sul­ta­tion pa­per, are also in part an ex­er­cise to con­sol­i­date sim­i­lar pro­vi­sions across dif­fer­ent classes of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions into a sin­gle piece of leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The new Act will en­able the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore (MAS) to ex­pand its pow­ers to is­sue pro­hi­bi­tion or­ders to de­ter mis­con­duct, it said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It will also broaden the cat­e­gories of in­di­vid­u­als who may be sub­ject to such or­ders, as well as ra­tio­nalise the grounds for is­su­ing them from a list of spe­cific cri­te­ria into a sin­gle test to deter­mine if some­one is fit and proper to work in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The MAS said the new pow­ers will al­low it to “holis­ti­cally as­sess whether a per­son’s mis­con­duct ren­ders him un­suit­able to per­form one or more roles within the fi­nan­cial sec­tor and the ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion that should be taken”.</p>
    <p>There are also pro­pos­als to ex­pand the scope of rules aimed at coun­ter­ing money laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing to in­clude people here who pro­vide dig­i­tal token ser­vices over­seas.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing leg­is­la­tion al­ready reg­u­lates most of the dig­i­tal token ser­vices pro­vided here, in­clud­ing re­quir­ing firms to set up ro­bust con­trols to de­tect and de­ter the flow of il­licit funds through the fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Such con­trols in­clude re­quir­ing fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to iden­tify and know their cus­tomers, con­duct regular ac­count re­views and re­port any sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The new pro­vi­sions will align Singapore’s regime with the en­hanced stan­dards adopted by the global watch­dog, Fi­nan­cial Ac­tion Task Force, for such ser­vice providers.</p>
    <p>The MAS also pro­posed that it har­monises and ex­pands the pow­ers re­lated to tech­nol­ogy risk man­age­ment to cover all reg­u­lated fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. This would in­clude cy­ber-se­cu­rity risks and data pro­tec­tion to deal with the per­va­sive use of tech­nol­ogy and the grow­ing so­phis­ti­ca­tion of cy­ber threats.</p>
    <p>It pro­posed raising the max­i­mum penalty for con­tra­ven­ing tech­nol­ogy risk re­quire­ments to $1 mil­lion – which would be a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease.</p>
    <p>In the case of banks, the penalty for a breach of a no­tice is­sued un­der the Bank­ing Act is a fine not ex­ceed­ing $100,000. A con­tin­u­ing offence brings a fur­ther fine not ex­ceed­ing $10,000 for ev­ery day the breach con­tin­ues af­ter con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>The MAS also pro­posed pro­vid­ing statu­tory pro­tec­tion to those work­ing in dis­pute res­o­lu­tion, such as me­di­a­tors, ad­ju­di­ca­tors and em­ploy­ees of the Fi­nan­cial In­dus­try Dis­putes Res­o­lu­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“This will strengthen their confidence to act in­de­pen­dently in re­solv­ing con­sumers’ dis­putes with fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions,” it said.</p>
    <p>Com­ments on the pro­posed new Act can be lodged at legal_dept@ mas.gov.sg by Aug 20.</p>
    <p>The new Act will en­able the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore to ex­pand its pow­ers to is­sue pro­hi­bi­tion or­ders to de­ter mis­con­duct, it said yes­ter­day. It will also broaden the cat­e­gories of in­di­vid­u­als who may be sub­ject to such or­ders, as well as ra­tio­nalise the grounds for is­su­ing them from a list of spe­cific cri­te­ria into a sin­gle test to deter­mine if some­one is fit and proper to work in the in­dus­try.</p>
