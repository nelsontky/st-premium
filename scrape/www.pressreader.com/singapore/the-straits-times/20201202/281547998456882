    <p>A cleaner who works at the tran­sit area of Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3 has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and is the sole com­mu­nity case re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She is 66 years old and lives in Yishun with her hus­band, who is un­em­ployed, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) last night.</p>
    <p>She tested pos­i­tive on Mon­day and was asymp­to­matic when tested. Her in­fec­tion was de­tected through MOH’s bi-weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT) of front-line work­ers.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient was taken to hos­pi­tal af­ter her test came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Her sero­log­i­cal test was neg­a­tive, which likely in­di­cates a cur­rent in­fec­tion, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>MOH added that she wears per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment at work, in­clud­ing face mask, face shield, gloves and gown, and that her ear­lier swabs done as part of RRT were neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress. All of her iden­ti­fied close con­tacts, in­clud­ing her fam­ily mem­bers and co-work­ers, have been iso­lated and placed in quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The other lo­cally trans­mit­ted case was a pa­tient from a for­eign work­ers’ dor­mi­tory, the first such case af­ter 20 con­sec­u­tive days with­out one.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient was de­tected through proac­tive sur­veil­lance, said MOH. All his close con­tacts at the dor­mi­tory and his work­place have been placed in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>He was among 10 new coro­n­avirus cases re­ported yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,228.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing eight were im­ported. They com­prised five work per­mit hold­ers com­ing from In­done­sia and Myan­mar, one work pass holder com­ing from Ja­pan, one spe­cial pass holder from In­done­sia and a one-year-old child com­ing from Rus­sia who holds a long-term visit pass.</p>
    <p>They were all placed on stay­home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Seven of the eight were asymp­to­matic and tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their no­tice.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial pass holder, a 43-year-old In­done­sian man, ex­pe­ri­enced an on­set of symp­toms on Sun­day and tested pos­i­tive on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Two food out­lets at Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3 – Ko­pi­tiam and Heav­enly Wang – were added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>With five cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,124 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity re­mains low, with a to­tal of five in the past week.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 29 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 31 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The other lo­cally trans­mit­ted case was a pa­tient from a for­eign work­ers’ dor­mi­tory, the first such case af­ter 20 con­sec­u­tive days with­out one. The pa­tient was de­tected through proac­tive sur­veil­lance, said the Min­istry of Health. All his close con­tacts at the dor­mi­tory and his work­place have been placed in quar­an­tine.</p>
