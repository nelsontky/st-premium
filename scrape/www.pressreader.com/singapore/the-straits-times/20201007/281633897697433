    <p>Fi­nan­cial ad­viser and blog­ger Leong Sze Hian’s shar­ing of an al­legedly defam­a­tory ar­ti­cle on his Face­book page caused lit­tle or no dam­age to Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s rep­u­ta­tion, and PM Lee should be awarded only nom­i­nal dam­ages, Mr Leong’s lawyer Lim Tean has ar­gued.</p>
    <p>By the time PM Lee’s lawyers sent a le­gal let­ter to Mr Leong on Nov 12, 2018, Mr Leong had al­ready re­moved the post, af­ter be­ing told to do so by the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity (IMDA) on Nov 9 that year, Mr Lim said in his open­ing state­ment i n the High Court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>PM Lee’s l awsuit against Mr Leong is not nec­es­sary, pro­por­tion­ate, ap­pro­pri­ate or j us­ti­fied, Mr Lim added.</p>
    <p>He noted that the ar­ti­cle con­tain­ing the al­legedly defam­a­tory state­ments orig­i­nated from the States Times Re­view (STR) web­site and was re­pub­lished on the Malaysian me­dia site, The Cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong merely shared a link to the ar­ti­cle on The Cov­er­age with­out com­ment, Mr Lim said, adding that his client is nei­ther the au­thor, editor nor com­mer­cial pub­lisher of the con­tent.</p>
    <p>The lawyer fur­ther said that Mr Leong is not seek­ing to de­fend him­self against PM Lee’s law­suit by ar­gu­ing on the ba­sis that the words com­plained about are true.</p>
    <p>Also, he has never chal­lenged the as­ser­tion that the con­tents of the post and ar­ti­cle are false.</p>
    <p>“His case is – and has al­ways been – that for (PM Lee), hav­ing re­gard to the po­si­tion he holds and the state ma­chin­ery he op­er­ates, to sin­gle out (Mr Leong) and to sue him for dam­ages and (ob­tain) an in­junc­tion for li­bel, for merely shar­ing a post to an ar­ti­cle in the cir­cum­stances set out, is wrong as a mat­ter of law and as a mat­ter of justice,” Mr Lim’s state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“The claim against (Mr Leong)... is an abuse of the process of the court.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim fur­ther ar­gued that Mr Leong had shared the ar­ti­cle in The Cov­er­age on his Face­book page be­cause he be­lieved it to be a rep­utable news out­let that would not have pub­lished such an ar­ti­cle with­out hav­ing taken some steps to try to ver­ify the claims in it.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong also con­sid­ered the ar­ti­cle’s sub­ject mat­ter – al­le­ga­tions of PM Lee’s i nvolve­ment i n the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal – to be in the pub­lic in­ter­est, Mr Lim said, not­ing that the ar­ti­cle had re­ferred to the claims as al­le­ga­tions, not facts.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong also did not know it had orig­i­nated from STR, Mr Lim added.</p>
    <p>To show that the dam­age done was lim­ited, Mr Lim said the post on Mr Leong’s Face­book page was ac­ces­si­ble for fewer than three days, be­tween 6.16pm on Nov 7, 2018 and about 7.30am on Nov 10, 2018. In that time, it re­ceived 22 re­ac­tions, five com­ments and 18 shares.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also said there were likely to be “thou­sands” of other users who had shared the same ar­ti­cle, but PM Lee is nei­ther su­ing them, nor STR and The Cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The lawyer added that his client had made other posts that pushed the post in ques­tion fur­ther down his feed, low­er­ing its promi­nence. Mr Leong also re­moved the post im­me­di­ately, af­ter read­ing the IMDA no­tice in­struct­ing him to do so.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also con­tended that PM Lee had not ex­plained his rea­son­ing in su­ing Mr Leong in par­tic­u­lar, and if he did not do so, then the li­bel suit is “nei­ther a nec­es­sary nor pro­por­tion­ate means to pro­tect rep­u­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment, Mr Lim sought to es­tab­lish that PM Lee’s law­suit is an abuse of the court process and vi­o­lated the Der­byshire prin­ci­ple in com­mon law, which bars pub­lic bod­ies in Bri­tain and other ju­ris­dic­tions from su­ing cit­i­zens for defama­tion, so as not to dis­cour­age free ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said the al­le­ga­tions in the post and ar­ti­cle had im­pugned the rep­u­ta­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment, not PM Lee per­son­ally, and that the Prime Min­is­ter had filed the “un­nec­es­sary” law­suit to pro­tect the Gov­ern­ment’s in­tegrity rather than his own in his ca­pac­ity as a pri­vate cit­i­zen.</p>
    <p>He also ar­gued, among other things, that the fact that PM Lee can sue for li­bel as a pri­vate cit­i­zen while re­fus­ing to dis­close doc­u­ments re­quested by the de­fence, on the grounds that it would be against pub­lic in­ter­est, shows con­flict of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>“That there is such a con­flict of in­ter­est, and be­cause (PM Lee) and the Gov­ern­ment have the means at their dis­posal to ad­dress what it con­sid­ers to be fake news, leads to the con­clu­sion that pub­lic of­fi­cers should not use pri­vate law pro­ceed­ings to pur­sue claims for dam­ages when the ac­cu­sa­tions re­late to their pub­lic role and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties,” Mr Lim con­tended.</p>
