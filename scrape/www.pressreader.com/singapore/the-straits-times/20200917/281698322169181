    <p>An il­le­gal get-to­gether dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker at EastBay con­do­minium has cost 11 men a to­tal of $25,200 in fines.</p>
    <p>The men pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic were banned from leav­ing home with­out a valid rea­son or meet­ing other peo­ple not liv­ing in the same place for so­cial rea­sons dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April 7 to June 1.</p>
    <p>Alex Teo Han Yuan, 27, was given the steep­est fine of $3,000 for hold­ing the event in May at his EastBay unit in Tay Lian Teck Road near Up­per East Coast Road.</p>
    <p>Teo Wee Liang, 27, was fined $2,700, while three oth­ers – Zane Lu­cas Quek, 27; Joey Seng Koon Hwee, 32; and Nicholas Tan Zhi Qin, 34 – were each fined $2,500.</p>
    <p>A fine of $2,000 each was levied on the other six men: Darren Ho Shu Qiang, 23; Neo Hwee Siang, 24; Ryan Tan Jia Wei, 25; Jef­frey Foo Chek Suan, 28; Lim Cheng Yao; 29 and Win­ston Lee Wei Zheng, 35.</p>
    <p>The case in­volv­ing a 12th man, Nicholas Lau Wei Chong, 25, is still pend­ing, with a pre-trial con­fer­ence to be held on Oct 15.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Yee Jia Rong and Kor Zhen Hong said that Alex Teo in­vited six friends to his home on May 16 as he was fac­ing per­sonal dif­fi­cul­ties at the time.</p>
    <p>Five were among the 11 con­victed yes­ter­day; an­other guest, Sim Jia Yang, will be dealt with later.</p>
    <p>These friends then in­vited more peo­ple to the gath­er­ing, with all ar­riv­ing from around 11pm.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the con­do­minium had nei­ther a guard­house nor a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer on duty that evening.</p>
    <p>Shortly after mid­night on May 17, its prop­erty man­ager alerted the po­lice after a res­i­dent com­plained about the un­law­ful gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>A po­licewo­man ar­rived at the unit at around 12.30am.</p>
    <p>Alex Teo iden­ti­fied him­self as the unit’s main ten­ant and ad­mit­ted he had al­lowed guests into his home.</p>
    <p>A first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000 for each charge un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
