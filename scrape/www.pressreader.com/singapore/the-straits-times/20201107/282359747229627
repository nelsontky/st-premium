    <p>TOO CHAL­LENG­ING</p>
    <p>It feels too trou­ble­some – what if the English words on the phone are too com­plex, and I don’t un­der­stand what the app says?</p>
    <p>To while away her time on week­days when her chil­dren are busy at work, re­tired dish­washer Wong Ah Moy, 80, often trav­els from her flat in Tampines to Toa Payoh bus in­ter­change, where she grabs a bite and goes peo­ple-watch­ing.</p>
    <p>Her no-frills 3G flip phone al­lows her to go on­line to per­form lim­ited func­tions, but she only uses the phone to call her fam­ily mem­bers oc­ca­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>With­out knowl­edge of how to use apps like Google Maps to find her way to new places, Madam Wong largely re­stricts her vis­its to fa­mil­iar haunts, such as Toa Payoh or Water­loo Street.</p>
    <p>“I don’t go to places I don’t know, be­cause I’m afraid that I will get lost,” she said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>She also misses her son, who is in his fifties and based in Aus­tralia, and wishes to hear from him more often. But as she has not down­loaded or learnt how to use mes­sag­ing apps like What­sApp, she gets up­dates from him only when he calls her ev­ery few months.</p>
    <p>While more se­niors have ac­quired new dig­i­tal skills dur­ing the pan­demic, such as go­ing for group singing and ex­er­cise classes on Zoom, or check­ing in via the SafeEn­try sys­tem, some like Madam Wong still have reser­va­tions about us­ing tech­nol­ogy – even when it is clear these tools ben­e­fit them.</p>
    <p>The lan­guage bar­rier poses a prob­lem for re­tired bus driver Giam Mee Tee, 81, who only knows how to make calls on his 3G phone.</p>
    <p>While he has heard he can get a ba­sic smart­phone at a dis­counted rate as part of the Mo­bile Ac­cess for Se­niors scheme and learn to use apps like Google Maps un­der the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme, he is still hes­i­tant.</p>
    <p>“It feels too trou­ble­some – what if the English words on the phone are too com­plex, and I don’t un­der­stand what the app says?” fret­ted Mr Giam, who is un­aware that some schemes un­der Se­niors Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme are also con­ducted in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, re­tiree Seah Din Heng, 73, was cu­ri­ous about the pro­gramme, which al­lows se­niors to pick up dig­i­tal skills like us­ing ba­sic apps for free at com­mu­nity cen</p>
    <p>tres, among other things – but is afraid to take it up.</p>
    <p>“I’ve heard about how there are scams on the In­ter­net – what if peo­ple con me and take my money? Maybe it’s bet­ter not to learn how to go on­line,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said op­tions should still be pro­vided to se­niors who are un­able to learn dig­i­tal skills so they are not left out as the pace of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion picks up. Cash, for in­stance, should still be an op­tion for se­niors who might not be fa­mil­iar with epay­ments.</p>
    <p>How­ever, learn­ing dig­i­tal skills is also im­por­tant for se­niors, as these skills that con­nect them to oth­ers and empower them to be in­de­pen­dent can make a cru­cial dif­fer­ence in their emo­tional, phys­i­o­log­i­cal, so­cial and men­tal well-be­ing, they added.</p>
    <p>While so­ci­ety may dis­miss se­niors as be­ing re­sis­tant to change, the fac­tors that hold them back dig­i­tally could be dif­fi­cult to tease out at first glance, said Mr Kelvin Lee, head of com­mu­nity en­able­ment and care­givers sup­port at Touch Com­mu­nity Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, some may find it em­bar­rass­ing to ask for help with dig­i­tal de­vices. Oth­ers could mis­tak­enly think it costs money to down­load a ba­sic app, and thus make do as they do not want vol­un­teers to know about their fi­nances, he said. “Typ­i­cally, it is only when you earn the trust of se­niors that they may start to open up about some of the chal­lenges they face,” Mr Lee added.</p>
    <p>This is why it is im­por­tant to tap com­mu­nity net­works to reach out to those hes­i­tant to ac­cess re­sources pro­vided by the Gov­ern­ment, he said, as se­niors may be more open to the idea of learn­ing new skills when sug­gested by a trusted vol­un­teer or be­frien­der.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh Kar Yan, an as­sis­tant man­ager at ComSA Kawan, also noted that some apps or sites are only in English, which makes it in­ac­ces­si­ble for se­niors who do not speak the lan­guage, or who are il­lit­er­ate. She has also come across se­niors with­out ac­cess to mo­bile data or Wi-Fi, which re­stricts their abil­ity to take part in on­line ac­tiv­i­ties. ComSA Kawan is a pro­gramme by Tsao Foun­da­tion to pro­mote so­cial par­tic­i­pa­tion among se­niors.</p>
    <p>From her ex­pe­ri­ence, re­ly­ing on fam­ily mem­bers to im­part dig­i­tal skills to se­niors is often not ideal, as re­la­tion­ship dy­nam­ics could get in the way.</p>
    <p>“Many times, we see or hear about chil­dren and grand­chil­dren get­ting im­pa­tient with their own se­niors while teach­ing or help­ing them on tech­nol­ogy de­vices,” she said. Ex­pe­ri­enced train­ers and vol­un­teers would have the pa­tience and pas­sion to guide se­niors, added Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>One such vol­un­teer is Madam Jessie Teo, 55, who first met Madam Ong Lee Toh, 73, when they at­tended a di­a­betes sup­port pro­gramme at Touch Com­mu­nity Ser­vices. Madam Teo, a re­tiree who worked in fi­nance, quickly be­friended Madam Ong, who also hap­pens to be her neigh­bour liv­ing in the same block.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic hit, Madam Teo taught Madam Ong how to make What­sApp video calls, and how to use her phone for the SafeEn­try dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Madam Ong now makes What­sApp video calls to her daugh­ter and her five-year-old grand­son, who live in Switzer­land. “I miss my grand­son a lot – it makes me happy to be able to see and talk to him on video,” she said.</p>
