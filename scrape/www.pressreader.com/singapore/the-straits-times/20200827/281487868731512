    <p>Ax­ing­ton Inc is head­ing into an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) to­day without word on the sta­tus of Ms Evan­ge­line Shen, also known as Shen Che, its non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man, who is linked to a re­ported £280 mil­lion ($505 mil­lion) of­fer to buy New­cas­tle United foot­ball club.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion (SGX RegCo), the reg­u­la­tory arm of the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change, rec­om­mended an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the suit­abil­ity of the board of di­rec­tors of Catal­ist-listed Ax­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices firm is now un­der in­creased scru­tiny for its links to Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, the Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered com­pany that had ad­mit­ted to doc­tor­ing pho­to­graphs of its founders with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Shares of Ax­ing­ton, which is con­trolled by two of BN Group’s founders, Sin­ga­porean in­vestors Nel­son Loh and Ter­ence Loh, halted trad­ing yes­ter­day af­ter clos­ing nearly 14 per cent lower on Tues­day to 19 cents.</p>
    <p>The trad­ing halt came af­ter The Straits Times broke news of the res­ig­na­tion of for­mer US am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar from his post as Ax­ing­ton’s in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor, and SGX RegCo’s call that di­rec­tors of Catal­ist-listed com­pa­nies should be as­sessed to en­sure they are “suit­able to sit on the is­suer’s board, tak­ing into ac­count their ex­pe­ri­ence, ex­per­tise, char­ac­ter and in­tegrity”.</p>
    <p>The Ax­ing­ton board in­cludes Ms Shen of BN Group, a Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant and busi­ness part­ner of the Loh cousins.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton, in a July 29 SGX fil­ing, pro­posed a name change to NETX, and to change its core busi­ness to pro­vid­ing med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness ser­vices, and in­vest­ments in med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, ro­bot­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>But even be­fore Ax­ing­ton’s share­hold­ers could vote this morn­ing on the name change and change of core busi­ness, among other things, mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als that were on NETX’s web­site ear­lier this week, which re­vealed the com­po­si­tion of its cor­po­rate gov­er­nance and man­age­ment board, were taken down.</p>
    <p>The NETX board was to con­sist of Ms Shen, its non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man; Mr Michael Wong, its non-ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor; Ms Mar­jory Loh, its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor; Pro­fes­sor Roberto Dona, its in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor and vice-chair; and in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors Alex Chua and Daryl Low. Mr Wa­gar was listed as its in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>The seven were also named as Ax­ing­ton’s board of di­rec­tors, ac­cord­ing to SGX fil­ings on July 21.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua is also an in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor of Catal­ist-listed Kitchen Cul­ture Hold­ings. Mr Low is a mem­ber of Hy­dra X, ac­cord­ing to the fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy firm’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Xi’an Jiao­tong-Liver­pool Uni­ver­sity’s web­site, Prof Dona is a pro­fes­sor of prac­tice in man­age­ment at IBSS, a busi­ness school of the uni­ver­sity in Suzhou.</p>
    <p>No Ax­ing­ton staff were present yes­ter­day when The Straits Times vis­ited the Sin­ga­pore ad­dress listed on the firm’s web­site, which ap­pears to be­long to its sub­sidiary, Ax­ing­ton Sin­ga­pore, for­merly known as Ax­ce­la­sia Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The given ad­dress, an of­fice unit in For­tune Cen­tre, was mostly oc­cu­pied by a dif­fer­ent ac­count­ing man­age­ment con­sul­tancy. The con­sul­tancy’s em­ploy­ees said the busi­ness was un­re­lated to Ax­ing­ton, which had rented a small space in the same unit.</p>
    <p>They said the staff of Ax­ing­ton, or Ax­ce­la­sia, have not been in the of­fice since April, adding that the com­pany’s head­quar­ters ap­peared to be based in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton had his­tor­i­cally pro­vided in­te­grated pro­fes­sional ser­vices, mainly to com­pa­nies in Malaysia. Af­ter it sold its core busi­ness in Malaysia to the Tri­cor Group, it pri­mar­ily com­prised its units in Sin­ga­pore, Laos and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The Laos and Viet­nam sub­sidiaries re­mained dor­mant, while the Sin­ga­pore unit recorded a small rev­enue of RM25,000 (S$8,200) dur­ing the first half of the year, ac­cord­ing to fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>In June, the Loh cousins made a manda­tory un­con­di­tional cash of­fer for all of Ax­ing­ton’s shares through Dorr Global Health­care, which they own.</p>
