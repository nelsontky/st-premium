    <p>Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer la­belled Manch­ester United’s hu­mil­i­at­ing 6-1 home de­feat by Tot­ten­ham on Sun­day as the worst feel­ing in 15 years at the club as a player, coach and man­ager.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham cashed i n on An­thony Mar­tial’s first-half red card to in­flict United’s joint-worst loss in the Premier League era – mir­ror­ing their 2011 de­feat by Manch­ester City – as Jose Mour­inho en­joyed a dream re­turn to Old Traf­ford.</p>
    <p>Son He­ung-min and Harry Kane scored twice as Spurs opened up a dis­or­gan­ised United de­fence at will even be­fore Mar­tial was harshly pun­ished for an off-the-ball clash with Erik Lamela. Tan­guy Ndombele and Serge Aurier were also on tar­get for Spurs.</p>
    <p>“It’s a hor­ri­ble feel­ing, the worst day I’ve had as a Manch­ester United man­ager and player,” said Sol­sk­jaer af­ter United lost their open­ing two home league games for the first time in 34 sea­sons.</p>
    <p>“It’s nowhere near good enough. I hold my hands up. It’s my de­ci­sion to pick the team I did.”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho’s suc­ces­sor dropped</p>
    <p>Vic­tor Lin­de­lof in favour of Eric Bailly, but the Ivo­rian was one of the big­gest cul­prits for the rout and was lucky to stay on the field for a couple of petu­lant kicks on Kane.</p>
    <p>The back four Sol­sk­jaer started cost £195 mil­lion (S$344.1 mil­lion), in­clud­ing Harry Maguire, the world’s most ex­pen­sive de­fender at £80 mil­lion. Yet the Eng­land cen­tre-back twice failed to clear, as did Luke Shaw, lead­ing to Ndombele’s equaliser. It was Ndombele’s first league goal in over a year, af­ter Bruno Fer­nan­des put the hosts in front from the spot.</p>
    <p>Maguire then fouled Kane be­fore al­low­ing the striker to take a quick free-kick while Aaron Wan-Bis­saka was also caught nap­ping, and Son was through for their sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer in­tro­duced hold­ing mid­field­ers Scott McTom­i­nay and Fred at half-time in a bid to stem the tide, but United kept get­ting cut open.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, who was sacked as United boss in De­cem­ber 2018, rev­elled in what he de­scribed as a his­toric day for Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>“It is his­tory for Tot­ten­ham, his­tory for my boys and I can­not deny it is also his­tory for me,” said the Por­tuguese. “Some peo­ple can say you play against 10 men for a long time which is true, but for me it is also true that 11 v 11 we were play­ing ex­tremely well. We were cre­at­ing huge prob­lems, we were win­ning 2-1 and they could not find so­lu­tions to con­trol us.”</p>
    <p>If United’s re­sults do not im­prove, the club could swoop for a for­mer Tot­ten­ham man­ager. Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino re­mains with­out a club since he was sacked by Spurs a year ago just months af­ter lead­ing them to a first Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal.</p>
    <p>The chas­ten­ing de­feat comes at the end of an­other dif­fi­cult trans­fer win­dow for United, who have pri­ori­tised at­tack­ing tar­gets like Borus­sia Dort­mund for­ward Jadon San­cho over re­in­force­ments at the back.</p>
    <p>Only newly-pro­moted West Bromwich Al­bion (13), who played a game more, have con­ceded more goals than United (11) this sea­son.</p>
    <p>For­mer United de­fender Pa­trice Evra said the Red Devils are “an em­bar­rass­ment”. “I don’t pro­mote vi­o­lence but many peo­ple need a good slap at this club right now,” added the Sky Sports pun­dit.</p>
