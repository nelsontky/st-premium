    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has dis­missed re­ports that he was air­lifted to Sin­ga­pore over the week­end pur­port­edly to seek emer­gency treat­ment in the city state.</p>
    <p>“If I want to go to Sin­ga­pore, I will go to Sin­ga­pore. If it is a pri­vate un­der­tak­ing, or if I want to at­tend the burial of a friend, I will go there, fly in, fly out,” he said dur­ing one of his late-evening meet­ings on Mon­day with his min­is­ters. But he said no such trip oc­curred.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have to keep it a se­cret be­cause I will not be us­ing gov­ern­ment funds… I am un­der no obli­ga­tion to travel in se­cret and not telling the Repub­lic at all,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ru­mours swirled over the week­end that an air am­bu­lance flew the 75-year-old from Davao City, his home turf where he has been stay­ing since early this month, to Sin­ga­pore on Satur­day for a med­i­cal emer­gency.</p>
    <p>His spokesman Harry Roque and the head of his se­cu­rity de­tail said Mr Duterte had never left Davao. On Mon­day, Se­na­tor Bong Go, who re­mains his chief aide, re­leased a photo of the Pres­i­dent din­ing with his wife and daugh­ter in Davao.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte said if he has to leave the coun­try for an emer­gency, he would first des­ig­nate his chief min­is­ter or de­fence min­is­ter as care­taker.</p>
    <p>He has never handed the reins of the gov­ern­ment to his Vice-Pres­i­dent, Ms Leni Ro­bredo, who leads the op­po­si­tion party, when­ever he leaves for of­fi­cial trips abroad. “If things are not quite good, if it’s all top­sy­turvy and I have to leave, then I’ll leave it in the hands of the mil­i­tary,” he said. “But oth­er­wise,” he added, “a leader will al­ways stay dur­ing a cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s health has been a re­cur­ring source of con­cern among law­mak­ers and his crit­ics be­cause it calls into ques­tion who will suc­ceed him. He has de­clared that Ms Ro­bredo is not fit to run the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dis­ap­pear­ances from pub­lic view have fu­elled ru­mours about his de­clin­ing health. But the gov­ern­ment has re­peat­edly dis­missed any sug­ges­tion of a prob­lem.</p>
