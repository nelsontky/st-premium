    <p>CAMP­ING AT HOME: The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has scut­tled many hol­i­day plans be­cause of lock­downs and bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>For celebrity cou­ple Moses and Aimee Chan, the re­cent surge in the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong has ru­ined their plans for a stay­ca­tion with their three chil­dren, aged be­tween four and six.</p>
    <p>Un­daunted, they de­cided to do a “camp­ing trip” at home so that the kids would not be dis­ap­pointed. They pitched and stayed in a tent, had daily “camp­ing food” and went on out­door ex­cur­sions, ac­cord­ing to a post writ­ten by Aimee Chan on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old posted sev­eral pho­tos of the “trip” in the liv­ing room and the food they ate – bis­cuits coated with choco­late and bar­be­cued sweet­corn and prawns.</p>
    <p>She also took her two boys on a na­ture walk to ex­plore the dif­fer­ent species of in­sects and plants, and said they came across two poi­sonous spi­ders and found two species of grasshop­pers.</p>
    <p>“Ai­den com­plained that camp­ing in the liv­ing room didn’t in­clude bugs. Boy, was he wrong,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress has not been ac­tive in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try af­ter she mar­ried Moses Chan in 2013 and gave birth to their first child Ai­den the same year.</p>
    <p>Chan, an award-win­ning ac­tor, re­mains one of TVB’s lead­ing men and is star­ring in the se­rial Death By Zero with Wayne Lai, Ali Lee and Katy Kung.</p>
