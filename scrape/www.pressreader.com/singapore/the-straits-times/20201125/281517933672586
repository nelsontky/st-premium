    <p>Med­i­cal work­ers at­tend­ing to peo­ple at a makeshift com­mu­nity test­ing cen­tre for the coro­n­avirus in Hong Kong’s Yau Tsim Mong dis­trict yes­ter­day. The gov­ern­ment has or­dered bars, pubs, night­clubs and party rooms to shut un­til at least Dec 2, fol­low­ing a sud­den out­break last week, linked to a dance club clus­ter. The num­ber of cases in the clus­ter has risen to 187. Of­fi­cials say this has been the largest Covid-19 out­break since the pan­demic swept the city, and it is the third time that bars and pubs in the city have been forced to close.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong will close en­ter­tain­ment out­lets in­clud­ing bars and night­clubs, for the third time since the Covid-19 pan­demic be­gan, to con­tain a bal­loon­ing dance stu­dio clus­ter.</p>
    <p>The out­lets will be closed from tomorrow to Dec 2. They were first closed in April and again from July to Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Other new mea­sures in­clude the stip­u­la­tion that all ban­quets will have no more than 10 ta­bles, al­though each ta­ble can still have up to four pa­trons, which is what is now al­lowed in eater­ies.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials said group gath­er­ings in ho­tels and guest houses will be re­stricted. For in­stance, the num­ber of guests in a room will be capped and there must be proper seg­re­ga­tion of quar­an­tine and non-quar­an­tine rooms.</p>
    <p>Ap­peal­ing to the pub­lic to re­duce din­ing out and avoid gath­er­ings, Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said the “sit­u­a­tion is dire”, with the source of in­fec­tions un­known for many cases in re­cent days, and a third of the new pa­tients asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The up­dated mea­sures come on top of ex­ist­ing re­stric­tions such as no more than four peo­ple al­lowed at any pub­lic gath­er­ing. Masks must be worn in pub­lic set­tings and restau­rants are to cap op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity at 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>The tight­en­ing of mea­sures comes as the dance stu­dio clus­ter ex­panded to 187 pa­tients, which wor­ried of­fi­cials have said is the largest out­break since the pan­demic swept the city.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Hong Kong recorded 80 new con­firmed cases, of which 69 were lo­cal and 54 linked to the clus­ter that started at a dance stu­dio in Wan Chai. This brings the to­tal tally to more than 5,780 cases, in­clud­ing 108 deaths.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day also is­sued a no­tice to say that seven more venues across the city – in Mei Foo, Aberdeen, Sha Tin and Tsim Sha Tsui – had been added to an ini­tial list of 14 dance stu­dios at the heart of the lat­est out­break.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors to the seven stu­dios have been given un­til tomorrow to get tested, while those who vis­ited the 14 dance stu­dios had till the end of yes­ter­day to sub­mit sam­ples for test­ing.</p>
    <p>Any per­son who fails to com­ply with the test­ing no­tice can be fined HK$2,000 (S$347). The per­son would also be is­sued with a com­pul­sory test­ing or­der and another fail­ure to do so could mean a fine of HK$25,000 and six months’ jail.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, who will de­liver her fourth pol­icy ad­dress today, said the gov­ern­ment is in a tight fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion. “We’ve had three rounds of anti-epi­demic funds – we’ve al­ready used HK$310 bil­lion. That may be the deficit of the gov­ern­ment this year.</p>
    <p>“We would like to make sure of re­forms, to im­ple­ment new ini­tia­tives with­out us­ing ad­di­tional mon­e­tary re­sources.”</p>
    <p>About 700 ini­tia­tives were pro­posed in the past three years, with 95 per cent com­pleted or in progress, she said, and the re­main­ing 5 per cent will be moved along as Par­lia­ment picks up speed.</p>
