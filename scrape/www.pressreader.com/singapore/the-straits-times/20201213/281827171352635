    <p>SEOUL • There were mixed re­ac­tions yes­ter­day in South Korea to the death of ac­claimed di­rec­tor Kim Ki-duk, whose cine­matic legacy was tar­nished by al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual as­sault.</p>
    <p>Kim, who won global fame with his bold por­trayal of ex­treme vi­o­lence and hu­man bru­tal­ity, died nine days shy of his 60th birth­day in Latvia on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>He faced a num­ber of sex­ual as­sault and abuse al­le­ga­tions from ac­tresses who worked on his films as well as other staff in re­cent years, all of which he de­nied.</p>
    <p>“Spring, Sum­mer, Fall, Win­ter... And Spring di­rected by Kim is a mas­ter­piece. I wish him peace in heaven,” wrote one user on Naver, South Korea’s big­gest Web por­tal, re­fer­ring to his 2003 film.</p>
    <p>Said an­other user: “I have watched many of his films. May he rest in peace.”</p>
    <p>But many oth­ers on so­cial me­dia crit­i­cised the con­tro­ver­sial di­rec­tor, point­ing to the abuse al­le­ga­tions against him.</p>
    <p>“A big loss and grief for Korean cin­ema,” read the head­line of a re­port on Kim’s death in South Korean daily The Fi­nan­cial News.</p>
    <p>Some re­sponded to the piece say­ing such praise was not de­served.</p>
    <p>“Kim does not and should not rep­re­sent the Korean cin­ema,” said one. “Di­rec­tors who re­spect ac­tors on the set and en­ter­tain the audi</p>
    <p>ence in the­atres are those who rep­re­sent the in­dus­try, not Kim.”</p>
    <p>An­other user said: “I hope the vic­tims of Kim’s abuses over­come their strug­gles and live a happy life.”</p>
    <p>Cov­er­age of his death in other South Korean me­dia re­flected the con­flict­ing views on the di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Kim Ki-duk: Golden Lion win­ner, al­leged abuser and dead from the coro­n­avirus... a life filled with ups and downs,” read a head­line by News 1, a lo­cal news agency, re­fer­ring to the top prize at the Venice Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>In 2017, a South Korean ac­tress ac­cused Kim of phys­i­cally abus­ing her the pre­vi­ous year on the set of Moe­bius. Soon, an­other ac­tress ac­cused him of rape, and a spate of other al­le­ga­tions from staff and per­form­ers fol­lowed.</p>
