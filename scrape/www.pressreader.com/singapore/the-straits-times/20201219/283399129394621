    <p>PUPPY LIKES NIP­PING AT THE HEELS</p>
    <p>I would like to know how to stop my seven-mon­thold puppy’s pe­cu­liar bit­ing habit. He likes to nib­ble mem­bers of the fam­ily with­out provo­ca­tion. When he fol­lows us around the home, he tries to bite our an­kles.</p>
    <p>Es­ther Yeo</p>
    <p>When it comes to po­ten­tial be­havioural is­sues in pets, it is im­por­tant to con­sider when th­ese is­sues arose and the spe­cific char­ac­ter­is­tics of such be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Did they de­velop re­cently or were they present all along? Are there po­ten­tial trig­gers or sources of anx­i­ety?</p>
    <p>“Mouthy” be­hav­iour in pup­pies is usu­ally nor­mal and can be mod­i­fied with the help of a com­pe­tent trainer. Pup­pies of­ten use their mouths to ex­plore and learn about the en­vi­ron­ment around them.</p>
    <p>There­fore, it is im­por­tant to pro­vide ap­pro­pri­ate out­lets, such as chew­ing toys, to give pup­pies the op­por­tu­nity to ful­fil their mo­ti­va­tions to chew and ex­plore.</p>
    <p>Bit­ing or nippy be­hav­iour may also be a sig­nal of their de­sire for play and in­ter­ac­tion with the owner.</p>
    <p>It is ad­vis­able to seek as­sis­tance from a qual­i­fied trainer to teach your puppy to re­di­rect such be­hav­iour to­wards more ap­pro­pri­ate ob­jects, as well as more de­sir­able be­hav­iour in place of nip­ping to seek at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the puppy can be taught to sit calmly in front of you in­stead of nip­ping your hands or an­kle when look­ing for at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>LICE IN­FES­TA­TION IN SHIH TZU</p>
    <p>My nine-year-old shih tzu Mickey has been in­fested with lice (right) since Fe­bru­ary. In July, he started the first dose of Front­line Plus lice therapy, which seemed ef­fec­tive. In Septem­ber, I ap­plied the third dose. But when I show­ered him re­cently, I was shocked to see the lice in­fes­ta­tion had re­turned. What should I do?</p>
    <p>Yuen Lai Keun</p>
    <p>Did your shih tzu have sim­i­lar is­sues prior to this? Is he on a reg­u­lar par­a­site treat­ment or did he start re­ceiv­ing it only af­ter the in­fes­ta­tion? Has he also been di­ag­nosed by a vet?</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar par­a­site treat­ment with the cor­rect dose and at the right fre­quency is an im­por­tant pre­ven­ta­tive mea­sure to keep pets healthy and free from par­a­sites.</p>
    <p>Se­ri­ous cases of par­a­site in­fes­ta­tion, in­clud­ing in­fes­ta­tion of lice, may lead to itch­i­ness and other is­sues, such as ex­ces­sive scratch­ing that may even­tu­ally cause skin dam­age and in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­cur­rent par­a­site in­fes­ta­tions and non-re­sponse to treat­ment may in­di­cate an un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal is­sue.</p>
    <p>Many par­a­sites such as fleas and lice can sur­vive in the en­vi­ron­ment for some time, and get­ting rid of them in­volves en­vi­ron­men­tal man­age­ment such as fre­quent wash­ing of bed­ding and toys with hot, soapy wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are in ad­di­tion to ad­min­is­ter­ing a treat­ment to deal with the par­a­sites. Visit your vet to ob­tain an ac­cu­rate di­ag­no­sis and de­velop a treat­ment plan.</p>
