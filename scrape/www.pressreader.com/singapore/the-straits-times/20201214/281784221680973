    <p>Sheik Heikel Khalid Bafana, a 48-year-old Sin­ga­porean, was re­cently de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act for tak­ing up arms and fight­ing along­side a fac­tion in the Ye­men civil war.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last Wed­nes­day, the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment said Heikel had also acted as a bro­ker be­tween this fac­tion and the for­eign power, which was not named. Here, ST ex­plains what the Ye­men civil war is about.</p>
    <p>The story</p>
    <p>The civil war started in 2014 be­tween Houthi rebels and govern­ment forces. But seeds of the con­flict were sown in the 2011 Arab Spring when mass demon­stra­tions and a near-as­sas­si­na­tion of long­time au­thor­i­tar­ian Pres­i­dent Ali Ab­dul­lah Saleh forced him to step down and hand over power to his vice-pres­i­dent Abed Rabbo Man­sour Hadi. The po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion a year later, over­seen by the United Na­tions, failed to bring sta­bil­ity to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In 2014, the Houthis – an antigov­ern­ment rebel group which cham­pi­ons the Zaidi Shi’ite mi­nor­ity – launched a re­bel­lion af­ter forg­ing an un­likely al­liance with for­mer pres­i­dent Ali Ab­dul­lah, who had wanted to re­gain power.</p>
    <p>The Houthis had their north­ern stronghold­s in and around Saada prov­ince in late 2014, be­fore mov­ing south and over­run­ning nearly the en­tire coun­try, in­clud­ing the cap­i­tal Sana’a. A power-shar­ing deal be­tween the Houthis and the govern­ment bro­kered by the UN was ig­nored. Mr Abed Rabbo fled to Saudi Ara­bia in March 2015.</p>
    <p>At his re­quest, Saudi Crown Prince Mo­ham­mad bin Sal­man or­gan­ised a coali­tion that in­volved eight other Sunni Arab states, in­clud­ing the United Arab Emi­rates, to in­ter­vene in Ye­men. The coali­tion – to­gether with lo­cal forces – launched air and sea strikes to fin­ish off the Houthis quickly and re­store Mr Abed Rabbo to power. Saudi Ara­bia fears the Houthis would be­come yet an­other Shi’ite proxy of Iran.</p>
    <p>The Saudi-led coali­tion is backed by the US, Bri­tain and France, which not only sup­plied weapons but also pro­vided lo­gis­ti­cal and in­tel­li­gence sup­port.</p>
    <p>The Houthis were pushed back but not dis­lodged from ter­ri­to­ries</p>
    <p>they seized in the north, in­clud­ing Sana’a. With Iran’s help, they launched mis­sile and drone at­tacks on Saudi Ara­bia, some of which hit prime tar­gets like oil fields. In 2017, the Saudi-led coali­tion tight­ened its block­ade of Ye­men. But it only wors­ened Ye­men’s hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis. The al­liance be­tween the Houthis and Mr Ali Ab­dul­lah fell apart in Novem­ber 2017. Mr Ali Ab­dul­lah died in a clash one month later.</p>
    <p>In July 2019, the UAE with­drew from the war. The South­ern Tran­si­tional Coun­cil (STC), a UAEaligned sep­a­ratist group, took ad­van­tage of this and seized the south­ern port city of Aden, then con­trolled by govern­ment forces. STC had ac­cused Mr Abed Rabbo of mis­man­age­ment and col­lud­ing with the Is­lamist forces. A peace deal bro­kered by Riyadh, which briefly al­lowed Mr Abed Rabbo to re­gain con­trol, was later ig­nored. In April, the STC de­clared self-rule in south­ern Ye­men. That same month, Saudi Ara­bia an­nounced a</p>
    <p>uni­lat­eral cease­fire be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Why it mat­ters</p>
    <p>Ye­men has suf­fered the world’s worst hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis in re­cent years. The UN es­ti­mated that four in five Ye­me­nis need hu­man­i­tar­ian aid. Ye­men has also strug­gled with the big­gest cholera out­break on record since the war started. The UN warned that the death toll from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic could “ex­ceed the com­bined toll of war, dis­ease and hunger over the last five years”. The nearly four mil­lion peo­ple who have been displaced could set off a wave of refugees across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>As the war drags on, Ye­men be­came a bat­tle­ground for proxy pow­ers be­tween Shi’ite Iran and Sunni Saudi Ara­bia. In the south, the govern­ment forces are ac­cused of forg­ing al­liances with ex­trem­ists and other mili­tias. Ter­ror groups like the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria and Al-Qaeda have been</p>
    <p>ex­ploit­ing the po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity in Ye­men to build strength.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis could also dis­rupt the world’s oil ship­ments, much of which pass through the Gulf of Aden, where Ye­men is si­t­u­ated.</p>
    <p>What’s next</p>
    <p>The cri­sis may have started in 2011 but the an­i­mos­ity be­tween the coun­try’s north and south dates back to the civil wars of the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Mr Abed Rabbo is un­pop­u­lar in the north. The STC has very lit­tle sup­port out­side Aden. And the Houthis are gen­er­ally re­ceived with hos­til­ity in the Sunni-ma­jor­ity south. Peace deals have been forged and bro­ken. Some pon­dered the pos­si­bil­ity of a south­ern se­ces­sion. But with­out a sin­gle force that could hold the coun­try to­gether, peace in Ye­men re­mains an elu­sive idea.</p>
