    <p>When I was bathing my four-year-old daugh­ter ear­lier this year, she started ar­rang­ing the bot­tles of sham­poo, con­di­tioner and shower gel neatly in a row, leav­ing a size­able gap be­tween each bot­tle.</p>
    <p>“They must also have so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” she re­minded me earnestly.</p>
    <p>She has since done the same with bot­tles of vi­ta­mins and her wooden peg dolls.</p>
    <p>I chuck­led when she first did it and took pic­tures to send to my mum and sis­ters.</p>
    <p>But think­ing back, I sup­pose this is a pre-schooler’s way of pro­cess­ing what is hap­pen­ing around her in this un­usual year – she tells me solemnly that she can no longer hold her good friend’s hand in her nurs­ery class when lin­ing up to go to the play­ground be­cause of “cononoviru­s”.</p>
    <p>The year has passed in a flash, but the pan­demic is far from over.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19-re­lated words now roll off her tongue with ease – Safe En­try, TraceTo­gether or Zoom – I sus­pect she may not re­mem­ber the de­tails of what hap­pened in 2020 when she grows up.</p>
    <p>But her sib­lings, at 11 and 14 years old, will.</p>
    <p>I of­ten won­der how they will look back on this pe­cu­liar year when they grow up; what they will re­mem­ber; and what they will tell their own chil­dren.</p>
    <p>I re­cently asked them what was most mem­o­rable about this year.</p>
    <p>Their replies ranged from mask-wear­ing to home-based learn­ing (HBL) to cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“At first, it was weird to see ev­ery­one wear­ing masks, but now I’m used to it.”</p>
    <p>“HBL was some­times bor­ing, but there was more time for fam­ily and other things.”</p>
    <p>“CB was quite spe­cial even though we couldn’t go out.”</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker started in April and schools switched to HBL, all ac­tiv­i­ties stopped and they no longer had to com­mute to and from school.</p>
    <p>For my two older chil­dren, it was a rel­a­tively slower-paced sched­ule than a nor­mal school term.</p>
    <p>We tried to keep to a rou­tine even as my hus­band and I ironed out the kinks of work­ing from home with a pre-schooler un­der­foot and dealt with the tech­ni­cal is­sues of HBL.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker came with un­ex­pected chal­lenges, for ex­am­ple, the sim­ple act of buy­ing gro­ceries and daily ne­ces­si­ties be­came more stress­ful.</p>
    <p>But there was also a pos­i­tive side. With­out a need to rush any­where, we had more time for all the things I’d al­ways wanted to do to­gether, but found dif­fi­cult to carve out time for – paint­ing, bak­ing, gar­den­ing and so on.</p>
    <p>Our favourite ac­tiv­ity was pos­si­bly play­ing card or board games ev­ery night, bond­ing for an hour or so be­fore bed­time. Such ac­tiv­i­ties pre­vi­ously hap­pened only dur­ing the school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>In a chal­leng­ing year where fam­i­lies are apart in dif­fer­ent coun­tries, busi­nesses strug­gle to keep afloat and health­care work­ers work long hours to keep the coun­try safe, I re­mind my kids that we are blessed to be stuck at home to­gether and have much to be thank­ful for.</p>
    <p>The year has taken away some of the com­forts we are used to, but has taught some un­ex­pected lessons I hope they will never for­get.</p>
    <p>I hope they re­mem­ber the dis­com­fort of wear­ing masks ev­ery­where. It is only with this in­con­ve­nience that they will ap­pre­ci­ate the sim­ple joy of be­ing mask-less when out and about.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, they used to com­plain about the heat when we went for na­ture walks pre-Covid-19. Now? They look for­ward to the day when we can take walks with­out masks on.</p>
    <p>I hope they re­mem­ber that all school matches and com­pe­ti­tions were can­celled this year, so that if and when in­ten­sive train­ing re­sumes dur­ing tour­na­ment sea­son, they will em­brace it, tir­ing as it might be.</p>
    <p>I hope they never take for granted time spent with fam­ily.</p>
    <p>In a way, my kids have found out first-hand how one of­ten does not value what one has un­til it is taken away... They now ap­pre­ci­ate each li­brary run more be­cause there was a time when li­braries were closed and they could not pop in and grab books as and when they wanted to.</p>
    <p>We didn’t ex­pect that when we said good­bye to my youngest sis­ter ear­lier this year as she left to re­sume her stud­ies in Aus­tralia, that we would not see her for the rest of the year or more.</p>
    <p>She has de­cided to stay there to fin­ish up the last year of her stud­ies next year in­stead of com­ing back for a break and risk not be­ing able to re­turn there eas­ily.</p>
    <p>In a way, my kids have found out first-hand how one of­ten does not value what one has un­til it is taken away, even if only tem­po­rar­ily.</p>
    <p>They now ap­pre­ci­ate each li­brary run more be­cause there was a time when li­braries were closed and they could not pop in and grab books as and when they wanted to.</p>
    <p>For all the grim news the year has brought, it has also been a year of en­light­en­ment. It re­minded me how lit­tle my chil­dren need to be happy, and how much they al­ready have in their lives.</p>
    <p>We dis­cov­ered the sim­ple joy of plant­ing seeds from fruit we eat and watch­ing them grow.</p>
    <p>The year has also re­minded me of how re­silient kids can be. I was wor­ried about them hav­ing to wear a mask for long stretches, es­pe­cially the four-year-old. But they have gamely kept their masks on in school de­spite the heat and dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>There are many ways to ride out a dif­fi­cult year and chil­dren of­ten take their cue from par­ents. So rather than be­moan the cir­cum­stances,</p>
    <p>I make it a point to count my bless­ings, no mat­ter how small.</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ingly, it is be­gin­ning to rub off them. As we took in the sea breeze while walk­ing at Labrador Na­ture Re­serve, my kids pointed out that the wind is a wel­come re­lief to our mask-clad faces.</p>
    <p>I hope that when my chil­dren grow up, apart from re­mem­ber­ing 2020 as the year of a global health cri­sis with its re­lated in­con­ve­niences, they will also re­mem­ber that look­ing for a sil­ver lin­ing can make tough cir­cum­stances eas­ier to bear, pan­demic or not.</p>
