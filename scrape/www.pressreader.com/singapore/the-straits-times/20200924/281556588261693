    <p>The Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil (CDC) Vouch­ers Scheme eased the cost of liv­ing for mid­dle-in­come fam­i­lies, and the vouch­ers helped give a boost to hawk­ers and small busi­nesses, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong. He said: “CDCs of­ten take a low pro­file, work­ing qui­etly but steadily to ful­fil their mis­sion. But in times of cri­sis, their con­tri­bu­tions are vi­tal, and be­come more ap­par­ent.”</p>
    <p>The five Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cils (CDC) rolled out over 70 ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing a stu­dent meal plan and a $20 mil­lion voucher scheme for 400,000 fam­i­lies, be­tween Fe­bru­ary and June to help Sin­ga­pore­ans cope with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The CDC Vouch­ers Scheme eased the cost of liv­ing for mid­dle-in­come fam­i­lies and the vouch­ers – meant for spend­ing at heart­land busi­nesses – helped give a boost to hawk­ers and small busi­nesses, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>He said: “CDCs of­ten take a low pro­file, work­ing qui­etly but steadily to ful­fil their mis­sion. But in times of cri­sis, their con­tri­bu­tions are vi­tal, and be­come more ap­par­ent.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee was speak­ing yes­ter­day at the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony of Sin­ga­pore’s five may­ors at the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA) head­quar­ters in Jalan Be­sar. Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, who is PA’s deputy chair­man, also at­tended the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>The CDC Stu­dent Meals scheme helps chil­dren from needy homes to con­tinue get­ting their meals so that they can fo­cus on their stud­ies.</p>
    <p>An­other ini­tia­tive, Skill­sFu­ture@CDC 2020, was an on­line event to help res­i­dents learn more about job search strate­gies and the skills needed to suc­ceed in the fu­ture econ­omy.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said: “CDCs il­lus­trate how we have struc­tured our so­cial sup­port sys­tem in a thought­ful and cre­ative way.”</p>
    <p>He added that they act as a bridge be­tween res­i­dents and the Government, and func­tion not just as hands and legs to im­ple­ment the pro­grammes, but also as the eyes and ears to iden­tify emerg­ing needs and gaps in so­cial sup­port.</p>
    <p>When a res­i­dent is in need and does not know where to get help, he can turn to the CDC, which can as­sist or re­di­rect him to the right agen­cies and lift some of the bur­den of nav­i­gat­ing the bu­reau­cracy, he said.</p>
    <p>“Most im­por­tantly, you can de­liver ser­vices with a hu­man touch, in a way that government agen­cies that op­er­ate on a national scale try very hard to do, but will find it harder to do,” PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>The Government, he said, fully sup­ports the mis­sion of the CDCs and that is why in this year’s Bud­get, CDCs were pro­vided with an ad­di­tional $75 mil­lion grant.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, three may­ors were reap­pointed – Ms Denise Phua, Ms Low Yen Ling and Mr Des­mond Choo. Ms Low re­mains chair­man of the May­ors’ Com­mit­tee, with a fo­cus on co­or­di­nat­ing the work of the CDCs.</p>
    <p>Newly elected Marine Pa­rade GRC MP Fahmi Ali­man will be Mayor of South East Dis­trict, tak­ing over from Dr Ma­liki Os­man, who is now Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, as well as Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>At North West CDC, Mr Alex Yam, an MP for Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC, takes over from Dr Teo Ho Pin, who held the job for 19 years and is Sin­ga­pore’s long­est-serv­ing mayor. Dr Teo stepped down from pol­i­tics at the July 10 Gen­eral Election.</p>
    <p>PM Lee thanked the two former may­ors for their con­tri­bu­tions, high­light­ing Dr Teo’s ef­forts in mak­ing the North West a vi­brant, ac­tive and green dis­trict, and Dr Ma­liki’s work in strength­en­ing the com­mu­nity spirit and sup­port­ing ac­tive age­ing.</p>
    <p>He said the new may­ors are just as pas­sion­ate as the ones they are tak­ing over from. Mr Yam has served in the grass­roots for many years and was a dis­trict coun­cil­lor in the North West, while Mr Fahmi has been in­volved in pub­lic ser­vice for a long time and is now work­ing for the National Trades Union Congress, PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to Mr Fahmi, PM Lee said: “Ev­ery­one who knows him de­scribes him as a gen­tle soul with a big heart. These are pre­cisely the kind of qual­i­ties he will need and all our may­ors need.”</p>
    <p>The new may­oral ap­point­ments were first an­nounced at the end of July by the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and took ef­fect on July 27.</p>
    <p>The may­ors are in charge of five CDCs, which lead and co­or­di­nate grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions. They also play a key role in help­ing to im­ple­ment government poli­cies.</p>
    <p>CDCs were first started in 1997 to get more Sin­ga­pore­ans in­volved in the com­mu­nity. Over time, they have also be­come a touch point for Sin­ga­pore­ans to get ac­cess to so­cial and com­mu­nity as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, who is also PA chair­man, said: “To ful­fil their du­ties well, CDCs must be led by strong lead­ers who are fa­mil­iar with the lo­cal com­mu­nity, and can mo­bilise and mo­ti­vate their coun­cil­lors, vol­un­teers and part­ners.</p>
    <p>He added he was con­fi­dent the may­ors would be able to build on the work of their pre­de­ces­sors and their own work in pre­vi­ous terms, and add to Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>CDCs of­ten take a low pro­file, work­ing qui­etly but steadily to ful­fil their mis­sion. But in times of cri­sis, their con­tri­bu­tions are vi­tal, and be­come more ap­par­ent.</p>
