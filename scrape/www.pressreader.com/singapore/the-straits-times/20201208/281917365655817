    <p>WASH­ING­TON US At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr is con­sid­er­ing step­ping down be­fore Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s term ends next month, ac­cord­ing to three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with his think­ing. One said Mr Barr could an­nounce his de­par­ture be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>It was not clear whether the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s de­lib­er­a­tions were in­flu­enced by Mr Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede his elec­tion loss or his fury over Mr Barr’s ac­knowl­edge­ment last week that the Jus­tice De­part­ment un­cov­ered no wide­spread vot­ing fraud. In the en­su­ing days, the Pres­i­dent re­fused to say whether he still had con­fi­dence in his At­tor­ney-Gen­eral.</p>
    <p>One of the peo­ple in­sisted that Mr Barr had been weigh­ing his de­par­ture since be­fore last week and that Mr Trump had not af­fected his think­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other said Mr Barr had con­cluded that he had com­pleted the work that he set out to ac­com­plish at the Jus­tice De­part­ment.</p>
    <p>But the Pres­i­dent’s pub­lic com­plaints about the elec­tion, in­clud­ing a base­less al­le­ga­tion ear­lier last week that fed­eral law en­force­ment had rigged the elec­tion against him, are cer­tain to cast a cloud over any early de­par­ture by Mr Barr.</p>
    <p>By leav­ing early, Mr Barr could avoid a con­fronta­tion with Mr Trump over his re­fusal to ad­vance the Pres­i­dent’s ef­forts to re­write the elec­tion re­sults. Mr Barr’s de­par­ture would also de­prive Mr Trump of a Cabi­net of­fi­cer who has wielded the power of the Jus­tice De­part­ment more deeply in ser­vice of a pres­i­dent’s po­lit­i­cal agenda than any at­tor­ney-gen­eral in half a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, it would please some Trump al­lies, who have called for Mr Barr to step down over his re­fusal to wade fur­ther into Mr Trump’s ef­forts to over­turn the elec­tion out­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr has not made a fi­nal de­ci­sion and the prospect of him stay­ing on un­til Jan 20 re­mains a pos­si­bil­ity, the peo­ple fa­mil­iar with his think­ing cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>Should Mr Barr step down be­fore the end of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, the deputy at­tor­ney­gen­eral, Mr Jef­frey Rosen, would be ex­pected to lead the Jus­tice De­part­ment un­til Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is sworn in.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr, 70, is the strong­est pro­po­nent of pres­i­den­tial power to hold the of­fice of At­tor­ney-Gen­eral since Water­gate. Soon af­ter he was con­firmed in Fe­bru­ary last year, he gained Mr Trump’s trust and his ear.</p>
    <p>He man­aged to heal fis­sures be­tween the White House and the Jus­tice De­part­ment that broke open when the Pres­i­dent learnt that his cam­paign was un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion re­lated to Rus­sia’s in­ter­fer­ence in the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Through­out the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign, Mr Barr was among the loud­est voices warn­ing that mail-in bal­lots would re­sult in mass elec­tion fraud.</p>
