    <p>Fi­nan­cial ser­vices plat­form GoBear has laid off six em­ploy­ees from its Sin­ga­pore of­fice, as well as 16 other work­ers from out­lets in Viet­nam, the Philip­pines and Ukraine ow­ing to the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Three of the six staff re­trenched here were lo­cals, the firm said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial ser­vices plat­form GoBear has laid off six em­ploy­ees from its Sin­ga­pore of­fice, as well as 16 oth­ers from branches in Viet­nam, the Philip­pines and Ukraine, ow­ing to the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Three of the six em­ploy­ees re­trenched here were lo­cals, it said yes­ter­day. Four were axed in the Philip­pines, nine in Viet­nam and three in Ukraine.</p>
    <p>The 22 peo­ple re­trenched rep­re­sent about 11 per cent of GoBear’s to­tal work­force of 200 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Around 70 per cent of the re­main­ing team in Sin­ga­pore are lo­cals or per­ma­nent res­i­dents, it said. The em­ploy­ees who were laid off came from the firm’s op­er­a­tions, prod­uct and tech­nol­ogy teams.</p>
    <p>GoBear chief ex­ec­u­tive Adrian Chng said: “This de­ci­sion was not taken lightly and fol­lowed a num­ber of pre­vi­ous cost-cut­ting mea­sures to im­prove ef­fi­ciency and fo­cus.</p>
    <p>“It is not a re­flec­tion of staff per­for­mance, but is sadly the re­sult of the on­go­ing im­pact of Covid-19 on GoBear’s busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“I am sad­dened that we have to come to such a de­ci­sion and am grate­ful for the con­tri­bu­tions of all those who have to leave us.”</p>
    <p>The af­fected staff have been pro­vided with post-em­ploy­ment sup­port, such as sev­er­ance pack­ages ac­cord­ing to lo­cal reg­u­la­tions in each coun­try and a post-em­ploy­ment re­sources pack with job search tools, help for pro­file and cur­ricu­lum-vi­tae build­ing, and govern­ment sup­port de­tails.</p>
    <p>Mr Chng said in a memo to staff that the com­pany’s ap­proach had been to fo­cus on re­duc­ing non-peo­ple costs first, with staff-re­lated mea­sures taken as an ab­so­lute last re­sort. “These de­ci­sions are not a re­flec­tion of in­di­vid­ual con­tri­bu­tion, but this is un­for­tu­nately a step we need to take to adapt and over­come the chal­lenges that GoBear will con­tinue to face as the world changes,” he said.</p>
    <p>GoBear had im­ple­mented other cost-cut­ting ini­tia­tives in re­cent months such as halt­ing non-es­sen­tial projects and re­duc­ing fixed costs and soft­ware li­cences.</p>
    <p>Mr Chng noted: “The reper­cus­sions from the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion have meant that we have had to take mea­sures to adapt our busi­ness to over­come chal­lenges and fu­ture-proof it for what lies ahead, by fo­cus­ing on our growth en­gines of dig­i­tal lend­ing and dig­i­tal in­sur­ance bro­ker­age.”</p>
    <p>In the memo, he added: “I am con­fi­dent that we will adapt to the new world and come to­gether to drive GoBear for­ward in our trans­for­ma­tion into a full-fledged fi­nan­cial ser­vices and data plat­form.”</p>
