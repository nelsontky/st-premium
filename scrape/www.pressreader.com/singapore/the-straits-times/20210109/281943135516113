    <p>Q How ef­fec­tive is the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine that has been ap­proved for use in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>A In Novem­ber, fi­nal re­sults from late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als pub­lished by the com­pa­nies showed that the vac­cine was 95 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There had been 170 cases of the dis­ease in its trial of more 43,000 vol­un­teers, of which 162 were ob­served in the placebo group and eight in the vac­cine group. Ten peo­ple de­vel­oped se­vere Covid-19, one of whom re­ceived the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The firms also said the vac­cine was well-tol­er­ated and that side ef­fects were mostly mild to mod­er­ate and cleared up quickly.</p>
    <p>As for the shot by Moderna, an­other lead­ing front run­ner, the ef­fi­cacy rate in late stage tri­als was 94.1 per cent at pre­vent­ing the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore an­nounced that it has also signed pur­chase agree­ments with China’s Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers say the Si­no­vac vac­cine was 78 per cent ef­fec­tive in a late-stage Brazil­ian trial, Reuters re­ported ear­lier this week, al­though the full re­sults have yet to be pub­lished.</p>
    <p>Q What cri­te­ria does Sin­ga­pore use to de­cide whether to ap­prove a vac­cine?</p>
    <p>A In line with in­ter­na­tional stan­dards, only Covid-19 vac­cines that are at least 50 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing the dis­ease will be ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors, such as the po­ten­tial risk of ad­verse in­ci­dents, and the sever­ity of the health cri­sis, are also con­sid­ered, Mr Gan told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>A lower thresh­old of ef­fi­cacy may be ac­cepted in the event of a very se­vere pan­demic that re­quires the pop­u­la­tion to be vac­ci­nated as quickly as pos­si­ble, he said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties will also mon­i­tor how the vac­cine is ad­min­is­tered in real life, as full au­tho­ri­sa­tion will re­quire long-term data to be avail­able.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers are also re­quired to re­port any ad­verse in­ci­dents that hap­pen so that Sin­ga­pore can keep track of the vac­cine’s per­for­mance as vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns are rolled out, as well as the po­ten­tial risks that it may carry.</p>
    <p>Q Will the Covid-19 vac­cine work against the new, more trans­mis­si­ble strain of the coro­n­avirus?</p>
    <p>A There is cur­rently no ev­i­dence that ex­ist­ing Covid-19 vac­cines are less ef­fec­tive against the new, more trans­mis­si­ble strain of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have pub­licly stated that their vac­cines are likely to pro­tect against the new strain, and are un­der­tak­ing stud­ies to for­mally con­firm this.</p>
    <p>Q How long will the im­mu­nity from vac­ci­na­tion last?</p>
    <p>A It is not yet clear how long im­mu­nity will last af­ter an in­di­vid­ual is vac­ci­nated against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But last month, Moderna pub­lished a study that said its vac­cine causes the hu­man im­mune sys­tem to pro­duce po­tent an­ti­bod­ies that en­dure for at least three months.</p>
    <p>Q Do the ben­e­fits of a Covid-19 vac­cine out­weigh the risks?</p>
    <p>A Yes, says the United States Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC).</p>
    <p>Only 29 in­di­vid­u­als ex­pe­ri­enced se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions to the coro­n­avirus vac­cine out of 1.9 mil­lion doses ad­min­is­tered, mak­ing it a rare out­come, said the CDC ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity (HSA) has said it will ac­tively re­view the data to en­sure that the ben­e­fits of the vac­cine, medicine or med­i­cal de­vice con­tinue to out­weigh the known risks.</p>
    <p>HSA may ter­mi­nate Pan­demic Spe­cial Ac­cess Route au­tho­ri­sa­tion at any time; for ex­am­ple, if new data sug­gests that the ben­e­fits no longer out­weigh the risks.</p>
    <p>QHow long will the im­mu­nity from vac­ci­na­tion last?</p>
    <p>AIt is not yet clear how long im­mu­nity will last af­ter an in­di­vid­ual is vac­ci­nated against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
