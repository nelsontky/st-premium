    <p>CHONGQING • Ms Lei Xia had evac­u­ated long be­fore the flood came on the af­ter­noon of J uly 16. She avoided heavy property loss as well as she had also taken her fur­ni­ture and elec­tric ap­pli­ances with her.</p>
    <p>“At about 3 o’clock that af­ter­noon, a sud­den rolling sound of gongs sig­nalled the com­ing flood, which bought time for us to re­lo­cate,” said Ms Lei, who owns a tea­house in the Kaizhou dis­trict of China’s south-western Chongqing mu­nic­i­pal­ity.</p>
    <p>Tor­ren­tial down­pours have been bat­ter­ing the up­per reaches of the Yangtze River where Kaizhou is lo­cated since July 15.</p>
    <p>Local vil­lage and town staff have been tak­ing turns to keep watch and pa­trol, most of them equipped with a gong in hand to beat at the first sign of dan­ger.</p>
    <p>Gongs, which have been used to raise alerts since an­cient times in China, still play an im­por­tant role in flood con­trol in ru­ral parts of the country, help­ing to save people’s lives and property.</p>
    <p>“Ag­gres­sive floods some­times come at mid­night or dur­ing the wee hours, and people know it’s com­ing when they hear the beat­ing of gongs,” said Mr Zou Pin­sheng, a town chief in Kaizhou.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the gongs, loud­speak­ers have also proven ef­fec­tive in is­su­ing emergency warn­ings.</p>
    <p>In the Tianba town­ship of Chongqing’s Wuxi county, sud­den flood­ing oc­curred when a river over­flowed dur­ing heavy rain at around 3am on July 16.</p>
    <p>“Get up and get out of the house! A flood is com­ing,” town em­ployee Yuan Zhu­jun shouted through his loud­speaker as the water rushed to­wards the town.</p>
    <p>People, stirred from their dreams by his cries, be­gan to move.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 residents had been evac­u­ated within three hours of the warn­ing, and the water level in town had reached 2m, with no ca­su­al­ties re­ported.</p>
    <p>“Com­pared with door-to-door warn­ings, us­ing a loud­speaker can warn many more residents, thus buy­ing time to evac­u­ate,” Mr Yuan said.</p>
    <p>Yet in vast ru­ral ar­eas across China, grass­roots work­ers still need to travel by foot around vil­lages and knock on doors at the drop of a hat, es­pe­cially in ar­eas mainly in­hab­ited by the el­derly who have poor hear­ing and can­not move fast.</p>
    <p>Mr Fu Shanx­i­ang, party sec­re­tary of the Xian­glushan com­mu­nity in Chongqing’s Wanzhou dis­trict, was still go­ing from door to door af­ter most residents had been evac­u­ated on the morn­ing of July 16.</p>
    <p>He found a rope, tied one end of it to a road­side tree and the other to his waist, jumped into the waist­deep tor­rent and waded to­wards an old man and a mother and daugh­ter cry­ing for help across the street on the sec­ond floor of a res­i­den­tial build­ing.</p>
    <p>The three stranded by the del­uge were saved.</p>
    <p>“Knock­ing on ev­ery door is a must. We’ll never let any­one get stuck at home, es­pe­cially the el­derly,” Mr Fu said.</p>
    <p>Drones, in­tel­li­gent pa­trol sys­tems as well as other smart tech­nolo­gies have been used to sup­port China’s flood con­trol ef­forts, while an­cient meth­ods handed down for gen­er­a­tions, like beat­ing gongs, re­main im­por­tant in un­der­de­vel­oped ru­ral ar­eas of the country.</p>
    <p>“Flood con­trol, af­ter all, re­lies on people,” Mr Zou said. “These old ways will never be­come ob­so­lete.”</p>
