    <p>It took Remy (not his real name) just one puff of cannabis to get sucked into the world of drugs.</p>
    <p>By the time he was 24, he had al­ready been abus­ing drugs for three years, and he was caught – for the sec­ond time – on his 24th birth­day as he was on his way to score more drugs.</p>
    <p>“I felt that was God’s way of giv­ing me a birth­day ‘present’, telling me to re­think my life and lead a bet­ter life,” said Remy, now 26, re­count­ing his drug jour­ney to The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The for­mer ad­dict, who has been clean for about a year, wrote to Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam last week to share his ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>He did so af­ter read­ing the min­is­ter’s re­sponse to a United Na­tions com­mis­sion’s move to re­clas­sify cannabis, also known as mar­i­juana and weed, as a less dan­ger­ous drug.</p>
    <p>Remy said that hav­ing been through the vi­cious cir­cle of drug ad­dic­tion, he wanted to share his story to mo­ti­vate oth­ers.</p>
    <p>His friends and his then girl­friend had i ntro­duced him to cannabis at a party.</p>
    <p>“I thought to my­self, OK, if my girl­friend can do it, why can’t I... I could not ‘lose out’ to her,” said Remy.</p>
    <p>The next time he was of­fered the drug, he had no more in­hi­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>“Since I’d tried it once, and there was noth­ing wrong (then), I thought, OK, I’ll try it again,” said Remy, who was then 21 and do­ing his na­tional ser­vice in the army.</p>
    <p>Soon, he started tak­ing the drug reg­u­larly and try­ing other psy­choac­tive sub­stances like “magic mush­rooms” and K2, a syn­thetic cannabi­noid.</p>
    <p>“It was some­thing that I had never ex­pected to see my­self go­ing through,” said Remy, adding that he once be­lieved he would not try any­thing other than cannabis, which he re­garded as a softer drug.</p>
    <p>While still in na­tional ser­vice, he was caught do­ing drugs by the mil­i­tary po­lice and sent to the de­ten­tion bar­racks.</p>
    <p>When he got out, he thought about kick­ing his drug habit, but was half-hearted about it.</p>
    <p>“Re­laps­ing was so easy when it was all around you,” said Remy, who con­tin­ued to hang out with his group of drug-abus­ing friends.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond time he was caught, he was with his friends on his birth­day when they were stopped at a reg­u­lar po­lice road­block. One of his friends had drugs on him, and Remy tested pos­i­tive for drugs.</p>
    <p>Remy was sent to the Drug Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Cen­tre for med­i­cal ob­ser­va­tion, and then placed in a twoyear direct su­per­vi­sion pro­gramme where he had to re­port reg­u­larly for urine test­ing.</p>
    <p>But he had a dif­fi­cult time try­ing to kick the habit. On one oc­ca­sion, he was ques­tioned and warned by his su­per­vis­ing of­fi­cer, as he was strug­gling to keep up with the urine test­ing sched­ule.</p>
    <p>That was his fi­nal wake-up call. “I was very scared, and I told my­self ‘no more run­ning’, no more pre­tend­ing that I’m on the safe route to re­hab.”</p>
    <p>He cut ties with his old friends and stopped vis­it­ing drug haunts. He also re­flected on what drugs had cost him.</p>
    <p>He had lost his job in a com­pany that or­gan­ised student camps be­cause of his ad­dic­tion, and his re­la­tion­ship with his fam­ily was strained.</p>
    <p>Now a dis­patch driver, Remy said he has re­peat­edly re­played, with re­gret, the mo­ment when he first said “yes” to drugs.</p>
    <p>Fight­ing the ad­dic­tion is a long bat­tle, he said, adding that he had to take it day by day, and avoid the trig­gers that would cause him to re­lapse.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the whole world’s sup­port is not enough... You ac­tu­ally have to de­pend on your­self,” said Remy.</p>
