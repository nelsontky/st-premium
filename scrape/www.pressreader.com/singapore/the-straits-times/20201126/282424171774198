    <p>PARIS • For­mer France rugby star Christophe Do­minici, whose daz­zling runs made him one of the coun­try’s best wingers, has died at the age of 48, his for­mer club Stade Fran­cais said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“It is with im­mense sad­ness that Stade Fran­cais learns of the death of Christophe Do­minici,” a state­ment read.</p>
    <p>He won 67 caps for France be­tween 1998 and 2007, scor­ing a mem­o­rable try in their stun­ning 43-31 semi-fi­nal win over New Zealand in the 1999 World Cup, elim­i­nat­ing the All Blacks, then led by the late great Jonah Lomu.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal po­lice said the diminu­tive Do­minici, who was only 1.72m, was seen by a wit­ness jump­ing from a dis­used build­ing in Parc de Saint-Cloud and prose­cu­tors have opened an in­quiry into the cause of his death.</p>
    <p>In his 2007 au­to­bi­og­ra­phy, Do­minici ad­mit­ted that he had suf­fered se­vere bouts of de­pres­sion fol­low­ing a per­sonal loss and that he had been a vic­tim of child abuse.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, he had worked as a pun­dit for French ra­dio and TV and was also in the public eye this sum­mer when he fronted a United Arab Emi­rates-based bid to take over Beziers rugby club.</p>
    <p>The of­fer, how­ever, pe­tered out when a fi­nan­cial in­ves­ti­ga­tion was made into its ef­fi­cacy and, ac­cord­ing to the BBC, he “was said by friends to have taken the fail­ure very badly”.</p>
    <p>Do­minici won five French na­tional ti­tles with Stade Fran­cais and four Six Na­tions ti­tles with Les Bleus, in­clud­ing two Grand Slams in 1998 and 2004, and the French rugby fra­ter­nity was in mourn­ing upon hear­ing of his death.</p>
    <p>“So much sad­ness. Christophe Do­minici was an im­mense player, an artist... His sud­den death is a shock,” French Sports Min­is­ter Rox­ana Maracinean­u said.</p>
    <p>“I’m dev­as­tated. With his crappy physique, he beat all the best de­fences in the world. It re­ally sucks to lose him at 48,” ex-France team­mate Syl­vain Mar­con­net added.</p>
    <p>The French Na­tional Rugby League, which over­sees pro­fes­sional rugby in the coun­try, said it was sad­dened by the death of a player who brought j oy to the French peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Con­do­lences poured i n from else­where. New Zealand Rugby called him “small in stature but a ti­tan on the field” in a tweet, with the Welsh union say­ing: “Adieu, Christophe Do­minici... what a player.” Eng­land Rugby called it “an in­cred­i­bly sad time”.</p>
