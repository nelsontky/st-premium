    <p>When in­ter­na­tional flights ground to a halt ear­lier this year, it was not only trav­ellers who could not catch a plane.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing mail from Sin­ga­pore, which is typ­i­cally car­ried in the belly of pas­sen­ger air­craft, also piled up, re­sult­ing in a months-long back­log.</p>
    <p>SingPost turned to cargo planes and sea ship­ments to help move these along, but de­lays re­main as flights are now at about five or six a day, down from 140 pre-pandemic, Sin­ga­pore’s post­mas­ter-gen­eral Vin­cent Phang said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>As the Re­pub­lic is a ma­jor trans­ship­ment hub, this af­fects not only mail gen­er­ated here but also items that pass through on the way to other coun­tries, he noted.</p>
    <p>Lock­downs in other coun­tries and higher freight charges add to the chal­lenges that the postal ser­vice provider is grap­pling with amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>SingPost last month re­ported a 12 per cent in­crease in rev­enue for the first quar­ter of the year off a rise in e-com­merce de­liv­er­ies, but prof­its were dragged down by a 22 per cent in­crease in ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Asked whether in­ter­na­tional postal rates are likely to go up as a re­sult of the de­crease in air con­nec­tiv­ity, Mr Phang said the rates are set by Univer­sal Postal Union, a United</p>
    <p>Na­tions agency.</p>
    <p>But this is­sue and boost­ing air links will likely be top­ics of dis­cus­sion when its mem­bers meet.</p>
    <p>Global sup­ply-chain dis­rup­tions, pandemic-re­lated restric­tions and a man­power crunch have af­fected lo­cal-mail de­liv­ery too, he noted.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, for ex­am­ple, SingPost had to ex­tend its stor­age space to house busi­ness mail which could not be redi­rected.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s move­ment con­trol or­der, which im­posed strict bor­der restric­tions, also led to a short­age of man­power as some post­men, who com­mute to work in Sin­ga­pore daily, could not re­turn. Those will­ing to stay here in the mean­time have been put up by SingPost.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Covid-19 cases among em­ploy­ees in March and April led to quar­an­tines, and the com­pany was down by a few dozen front­line staff at one point, which led to some de­lays, Mr Phang said.</p>
    <p>While there have been some com­plaints, the pub­lic has gen­er­ally been un­der­stand­ing given the cir­cum­stances, he noted.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomer sat­is­fac­tion has im­proved over last year, when it was in the spot­light for a slew of de­liv­ery mishaps.</p>
    <p>The postal ser­vice provider was also fined $400,000 for fail­ing to meet gov­ern­ment de­liv­ery stan­dards in 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Changes put in place late last year to ad­dress ser­vice is­sues – in­clud­ing hir­ing more post­men and di­rect­ing all pack­ages to the let­ter­box – have helped it to sur­vive the cur­rent op­er­a­tional chal­lenges, he said. “Had we not done that, I think we would be in a world of pain.”</p>
    <p>The e-com­merce boom over the re­cent months has brought chal­lenges as well as new part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>It be­gan to of­fer de­liv­ery of medicine dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker in April, and now de­liv­ers high-se­cu­rity items such as pass­ports and iden­tity cards.</p>
    <p>There are also plans to work with on­line sell­ers to boost smaller bas­ket pur­chases. “I like to think that Covid-19 presents op­por­tu­ni­ties,” said Mr Phang.</p>
