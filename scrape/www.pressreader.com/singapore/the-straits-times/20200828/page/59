        Jobs C19 | FRIDAY, AUGUST 28, 2020 Old is gold: Don’t lose out to your competitor­s in tapping on mature profession­als Older workers bring with them a wealth of experience and, contrary to popular belief, are open to learning new skills and adapting to changing environmen­ts. Founder of Axiom IT Solutions was persistent about rehiring a mature profession­al whose abilities he never lost faith in, with a little help and support from Workforce Singapore. platform to local public telephone networks so that their clients can conduct business calls through the Microsoft Teams app on their personal phones.
Skills can be learnt and upgraded at any time, said Mr Lam, but the kind of vast industry knowledge and experience – especially in voice technology – that Mr Tan brings to the table is something that cannot be acquired overnight.
After his retirement in 2014, Mr Tan had to care for his wife who had fallen ill. But as she recovered, he looked for opportunit­ies to keep himself occupied. He considered working with church groups and volunteeri­ng but that wasn’t ideal. That was when he heard from his old contact, Mr Lam. scheme by Workforce Singapore
(WSG) and NTUC’s Employment and Employabil­ity Institute (e2i) — which helps encourage companies to hire experience­d profession­als, managers, executives and technician­s (PMETs).
“I learnt about the programme after attending a seminar for SMEs organised by e2i and then spoke to WSG,” he said. “This was the perfect opportunit­y to get Stephen on board,” added Mr Lam. When it comes to hiring mature workers, most companies tend to hesitate at the prospect. Are their skills outdated? Can they adapt? Will they be able to perform after retirement? Are they costly to hire?
While these concerns are understand­able, they can also unfairly stereotype these highly skilled and experience­d profession­als.
They can bring many advantages to one’s organisati­on as Mr Lam Pang Ngean, the founder and director of Axiom IT Solutions, discovered when he hired 70 year old Mr Stephen Tan, a retired profession­al with over four decades of experience leading telecommun­ications and informatio­n technology projects at Singtel.
“I was looking for a suitable candidate with relevant domain knowledge to spearhead a project,” said Mr Lam. “He was the ideal person. He had the necessary knowledge and experience,” he added.
And true enough, now as Product Manager at Axiom, Mr Tan leads the company’s new Teams Connector service and helped lay the foundation to launch the project. The new product links the Microsoft Teams SGUNITED MID-CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAMME (ATTACHMENT­S) Given the current economic climate, companies may not have the capacity or ability to hire. As such, companies can consider tapping into the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme (Attachment­s). Under the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme (Attachment­s), companies can take on mid-career individual­s on attachment­s while preparing for more permanent jobs. Upon completion of the attachment, host organisati­ons can consider hiring well-performing individual­s as permanent employees.
The government will fund 80 per cent of the training allowance of the mid-career individual on attachment and the monthly allowance varies on the scope of the attachment.
If you would like to bring mid-career individual­s on board your company and sign up as a host organisati­on, find out more at go.gov.sg/sgup-hostorgs.
If you are a mid-career individual who is keen to take on attachment­s, you can find out more about the programme at go.gov.sg/sgup-midcareer or visit MyCareersF­uture.sg and search for attachment opportunit­ies under the hashtag #SGUP or select ”For Workplace Attachment: If you are mid-career seeking attachment" under the field Government Support.
Find out more about how WSG can help you in your career by registerin­g your interest to see a career coach at go.gov.sg/careeradvi­ce7. A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE “It’s great to be working again!” said Mr Tan. “The job is very challengin­g, and I relish challenges,” he further enthused.
The main challenge he faced was getting up to speed on new technology. As much as he mentors his juniors, Mr Tan was equally keen to learn from them about Microsoft cloud computing.
“I’m just a user of applicatio­ns such as Excel or Word like most people,” he said. “It just goes to show that while I don’t know everything, it gives me an opportunit­y to learn by interactin­g with people and they have been very helpful,” he said with a smile. A WIN-WIN SOLUTION However, Mr Lam could not hire him immediatel­y. He found himself in what would be a familiar scenario for most employers. He had identified the perfect candidate but did not have the budget to recruit him.
It was at this time that Mr Lam found out about the Career Support Programme (CSP) – a salary support Drivers/ Chauffeurs Drivers/ Chauffeurs Despatch/ Delivery Cleaners Cleaners Other Positions Other Positions Cleaners 789 789 769 769 769 772 775 775 $1450-$2000.
