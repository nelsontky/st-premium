    <p>ISLAMABAD • Pak­istan’s telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions reg­u­la­tor has is­sued a “fi­nal warn­ing” to short-form video app TikTok over “im­moral” con­tent posted on the plat­form, while livestream­ing app Bigo Live has been blocked in the country for the same rea­son.</p>
    <p>TikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, is al­ready fac­ing prob­lems with the au­thor­i­ties in a num­ber of coun­tries in­clud­ing Aus­tralia, In­dia and the United States due to se­cu­rity and pri­vacy is­sues.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion Au­thor­ity (PTA) said in a state­ment on Mon­day that it had sent TikTok and Bigo Live no­tices to mod­er­ate their con­tent af­ter get­ting com­plaints but their re­sponse was un­sat­is­fac­tory.</p>
    <p>“PTA has de­cided to im­me­di­ately block Bigo and is­sue fi­nal warn­ing to TikTok to put in place a com­pre­hen­sive mech­a­nism to con­trol ob­scen­ity, vul­gar­ity and im­moral­ity through its social me­dia ap­pli­ca­tion,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>TikTok rep­re­sen­ta­tives did not re­spond to a re­quest by Reuters for com­ment. Singapore-based Bigo Tech­nol­ogy, which owns the live video-stream­ing app Bigo Live, also did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>TikTok is among the world’s most pop­u­lar social me­dia apps, with more than two bil­lion down­loads glob­ally.</p>
    <p>In Pak­istan, it has been down­loaded al­most 39 mil­lion times and is the third most-down­loaded app over the past year, af­ter What­sApp and Face­book, said an­a­lyt­ics firm Sen­sor Tower.</p>
    <p>Bigo Live has been down­loaded over 17 mil­lion times in Pak­istan and is the 19th-most down­loaded app in the country.</p>
    <p>TikTok was banned for a short pe­riod in In­dia last year af­ter a court said it en­cour­aged pornog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>While that or­der was over­turned af­ter a le­gal chal­lenge by the com­pany, the In­dian govern­ment re­cently banned the app again following a mil­i­tary stand-off on the border with China.</p>
    <p>Though Pak­istan is a so­cially con­ser­va­tive, mostly Mus­lim country, it shares close ties with com­mu­nist-ruled China. Pak­istan counts China as its largest in­vestor and most re­li­able ally.</p>
    <p>The two apps are not the first to be tar­geted by the PTA.</p>
    <p>In July, the PTA banned the PlayerUn­k­nown’s Bat­tle­grounds plat­form, which has over 16 mil­lion users in Pak­istan, be­cause it had re­ceived com­plaints “that the game is ad­dic­tive, wastage of time and poses se­ri­ous neg­a­tive im­pact on the phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal health of chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan’s re­cently passed social me­dia and dig­i­tal laws have been widely crit­i­cised by rights ac­tivists as be­ing dra­co­nian be­cause of the sweep­ing pow­ers given to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
