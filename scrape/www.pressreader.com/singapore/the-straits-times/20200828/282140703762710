    <p>A High Court judge has re­it­er­ated that the pros­e­cu­tion has a duty to dis­close wit­ness state­ments to the de­fence, even when there is doubt about the rel­e­vance or im­pact of the ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>This point has been con­sis­tently made clear by the Court of Ap­peal in de­ci­sions since 2011, said Jus­tice Aedit Ab­dul­lah.</p>
    <p>He added that it would not be ap­pro­pri­ate to hold back dis­clo­sure of a state­ment just so it can be used as a strate­gic check against a wit­ness’ tes­ti­mony in court.</p>
    <p>The judge made the com­ments in a judg­ment re­leased yes­ter­day on why he al­lowed a mo­tion by busi­ness­man Lim Hong Liang to place a wit­ness state­ment be­fore the court in his ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Lim, 56, is ap­peal­ing against his con­vic­tion and sen­tence of six years’ jail, meted out by a district judge last year, over a con­spir­acy to at­tack his mis­tress’ younger lover.</p>
    <p>His ap­peal was first heard in Jan­u­ary and an is­sue arose over the district judge’s re­fusal to or­der pros­e­cu­tors to pro­duce a state­ment given by a per­son named Ed­win.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors re­sisted pro­duc­ing Ed­win’s state­ment, ar­gu­ing that it was likely to im­pli­cate Lim and would not lead to a real line of in­quiry for the de­fence.</p>
    <p>In other words, the pros­e­cu­tion ar­gued that the state­ment did not meet the cri­te­ria for dis­clo­sure set out by the apex court in its land­mark judg­ment in 2011.</p>
    <p>In that judg­ment, the Court of Ap­peal ruled that the pros­e­cu­tion had a duty to dis­close to the court rel­e­vant ma­te­rial that is not favourable to its case.</p>
    <p>In March this year, be­fore Jus­tice Aedit gave his de­ci­sion, the Court of Ap­peal is­sued a judg­ment which ex­panded on the duty of dis­clo­sure.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the apex court said it did not mat­ter whether the state­ment was favourable, neu­tral or ad­verse to the ac­cused per­son.</p>
    <p>In April, the pros­e­cu­tion con­ceded that Ed­win’s state­ment should have been dis­closed.</p>
    <p>Lim, rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel N. Sreeni­vasan, then filed the mo­tion for the state­ment to be shown to the court.</p>
    <p>Mr Sreeni­vasan also sought costs against the pros­e­cu­tion, con­tend­ing that the re­fusal to give the state­ment amounted to friv­o­lous and vex­a­tious con­duct.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Lee Lit Cheng ar­gued that the breach was not de­lib­er­ate; rather, the pros­e­cu­tors at trial had as­sessed that the state­ment was neu­tral.</p>
    <p>She also ar­gued that the state­ment was in­ad­mis­si­ble as ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Aedit ruled that the state­ment should be placed be­fore the court to in­di­cate a breach of dis­clo­sure obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>A fail­ure to dis­close can lead to the con­vic­tion be­ing over­turned or a re­trial, but this would be de­ter­mined af­ter fur­ther ar­gu­ments are made.</p>
    <p>The judge, how­ever, said the de­fence would have to make a sep­a­rate ap­pli­ca­tion to have the state­ment ad­mit­ted as ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>He de­clined to or­der costs, say­ing that the pros­e­cu­tion’s con­duct was not un­rea­son­able or un­war­ranted.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Aedit ruled that the state­ment should be placed be­fore the court to in­di­cate a breach of dis­clo­sure obli­ga­tions. A fail­ure to dis­close can lead to the con­vic­tion be­ing over­turned or a re­trial, but this would be de­ter­mined af­ter fur­ther ar­gu­ments are made.</p>
