    <p>Speak­ers who are over­seas will be able to go “live” on stage in Sin­ga­pore de­spite Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions, after Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) un­veiled a new hy­brid event broad­cast stu­dio with holo­gram func­tion­al­i­ties yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated at Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, the state-of-the-art stu­dio is able to beam some­one onto its stage re­motely through a holo­graphic pres­ence with re­al­time move­ments.</p>
    <p>The pre­sen­ter will even be able to pace the stage just like he would in real life, as long as he stays in his cam­era’s frame.</p>
    <p>The stu­dio, which has broad­castqual­ity live-stream­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, can also ac­com­mo­date a live au­di­ence of up to 50 peo­ple to host meet­ings in a hy­brid for­mat.</p>
    <p>With the launch of this high-tech stu­dio, MBS can now host events even as Covid-19 re­stric­tions re­main and its con­ven­tion fa­cil­i­ties stay closed.</p>
    <p>MBS’ vice-pres­i­dent of con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions Ong Wee Min said that while holo­graphic telep­res­ence has been used in the busi­ness events in­dus­try, this is the first time the tech­nol­ogy is be­ing used in such a set-up.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the high-tech stu­dio a “showstoppe­r” for the in­dus­try, he added: “The set-up has the abil­ity to com­bine aug­mented re­al­ity, vir­tual re­al­ity and ex­tended re­al­ity, as we con­tinue to en­hance our hy­brid broad­cast stu­dio ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“These holo­graphic func­tion­al­i­ties will pro­vide clients with count­less op­por­tu­ni­ties to wow their com­mu­ni­ties through im­mer­sive con­tent de­liv­ered in a bold and cap­ti­vat­ing man­ner,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre­piece in MBS’ stu­dio is a three-di­men­sional stage where the con­ven­tional green screen back­drop is re­placed with two 6m by 4m right-an­gled LED walls. These can show high-res­o­lu­tion 360-de­gree vi­su­als and are com­ple­mented by a plex­i­glass LED floor that can dis­play floor pro­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>These, along with the stage light­ing sys­tem, can be re­con­fig­ured and cus­tomised to suit the needs of dif­fer­ent events.</p>
    <p>The set-up of the stage is de­signed to pro­vide pre­sen­ters with a bet­ter per­spec­tive of their sur­round­ings by help­ing them to vi­su­alise and de­liver their pre­sen­ta­tions in a more im­mer­sive en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>It was de­signed and built after months of col­lab­o­ra­tion among in-house and ex­ter­nal tech­ni­cal ex­perts, as well as other in­dus­try play­ers.</p>
    <p>The set-up has the abil­ity to com­bine aug­mented re­al­ity, vir­tual re­al­ity and ex­tended re­al­ity, as we con­tinue to en­hance our hy­brid broad­cast stu­dio ca­pa­bil­i­ties. These holo­graphic func­tion­al­i­ties will pro­vide clients with count­less op­por­tu­ni­ties to wow their com­mu­ni­ties through im­mer­sive con­tent de­liv­ered in a bold and cap­ti­vat­ing man­ner.</p>
    <p>A soft launch of the stu­dio was held last month through a we­bi­nar, where a re­motely lo­cated pre­sen­ter was beamed onto the set along­side two in-per­son pre­sen­ters to a vir­tual au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Last month, MBS re­ported a loss of US$113 mil­lion (S$155 mil­lion) for the sec­ond quar­ter, after a shut­down of nearly three months be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) pre­vi­ously an­nounced it will trial two busi­ness events in Au­gust and Septem­ber, each with at­ten­dance of up to 50 peo­ple on site and oth­ers vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>This hy­brid for­mat of face-to­face and vir­tual in­ter­ac­tions could pave the way for more of such events to be held here if suc­cess­ful, said the STB.</p>
    <p>This would help revive the meet­ings, in­cen­tive travel, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions sec­tor, which ground to a halt in March when all phys­i­cal busi­ness-to-busi­ness events were put on hold as part of mea­sures to con­tain the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­sides MBS, a num­ber of com­pa­nies have also adapted their spa­ces for event use in the face of Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Cap­i­taLand’s wholly owned l odg­ing busi­ness unit The As­cott has rented out spa­ces at some of its prop­er­ties world­wide to be used as venues for livestream­ing and fit­ness events.</p>
    <p>In June, night­club Zouk inked a deal with e-com­merce site Lazada to rent out its 31,000 sq ft Clarke Quay club as a live-stream­ing venue.</p>
