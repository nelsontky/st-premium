    <p>Among all the sec­tors ham­mered by the pan­demic, tourism has cer­tainly been one of the hard­est hit, so it is no sur­prise that work­ers in the in­dus­try are try­ing to find other work.</p>
    <p>Among them is Ms Josephine Oh, who was a tour guide for about three decades be­fore the pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>Ms Oh, 50, said: “By mid-Fe­bru­ary, my fel­low tour guides and I were wor­ried, but it didn’t re­ally hit me till the end of March. For a month, there was a bit of down­time for me, but then I started to panic.</p>
    <p>“I knew this could not go on. The worst thing is that you don’t see the light at the end of the tun­nel. It was very scary and I de­cided that I should not just worry and do noth­ing about it.”</p>
    <p>Ms Oh signed up for cour­ses with NTUC Learn­ingHub, which pro­vides train­ing ser­vices and so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>She learnt about e-com­merce and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing. “It set me think­ing – since I’ve al­ready been bak­ing, why not take it to the next level by sell­ing on­line?</p>
    <p>“I was very ap­pre­hen­sive as I’d never been on the com­puter much be­fore. But I had no choice and I de­cided to jump on the band­wagon and dig­i­talise my­self.”</p>
    <p>Ms Oh started by putting her baked goods on e-com­merce plat­form Carousell. “I started small be­cause I didn’t want to pay for a whole new plat­form. I got a cou­ple of re­views and it gave me con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>She re­alised that many strangers were or­der­ing her baked treats, not just fam­ily mem­bers or friends.</p>
    <p>Ms Oh has also started her own web­site called Jobakesgre­at, and is track­ing trends, such as the grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of burnt cheese­cake, and sell­ing hot items like it.</p>
    <p>“I’m tak­ing it one day at a time. Tourism is not com­ing back any time soon and I don’t want to pin my hopes on it,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Bak­ing and sell­ing on­line is now a vi­able ca­reer op­tion and many peo­ple do it.”</p>
    <p>Ms Oh has two school-go­ing chil­dren and her hus­band is a self-em­ployed en­ter­tainer.</p>
    <p>She said the rev­enue from sell­ing baked goods is still lower than her pre­vi­ous salary, but it is some­thing she ac­cepts for now as she em­braces her new life.</p>
    <p>“I am also get­ting into data an­a­lyt­ics so I learn how to mon­i­tor the rev­enue,” she said.</p>
