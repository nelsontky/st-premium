    <p>• The Philip­pine au­thor­i­ties have or­dered thou­sands of residents in eastern coastal com­mu­ni­ties to evac­u­ate ahead of the land­fall of Ty­phoon Vamco, only weeks af­ter the coun­try was bat­tered by the strong­est ty­phoon so far this year.</p>
    <p>State weather fore­caster Chris Perez told DZMM ra­dio that the ty­phoon was due to make land­fall in Po­lillo is­land last night and hit rice-pro­duc­ing prov­inces north of the cap­i­tal Manila be­fore ex­it­ing the Philip­pines’ main is­land of Lu­zon to­day.</p>
    <p>Vamco, with sus­tained winds of 125kmh and gusts of up to 155kmh, is the 21st trop­i­cal storm to hit the</p>
    <p>Philip­pines this year.</p>
    <p>The gov­er­nor of Catan­d­u­anes prov­ince Joseph Cua told DZMM ra­dio: “We are just 1 per cent into our re­cov­ery and then here comes an­other ty­phoon. We’re now feel­ing strong wind and rain.”</p>
    <p>The is­land prov­ince of Catan­d­u­anes and nearby Al­bay, both south-east of Manila, bore the brunt of Ty­phoon Goni late last month, a Cat­e­gory 4 ty­phoon that killed 25 peo­ple and left six peo­ple miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Po­lillo Mayor Cristina Bosque said residents in coastal com­mu­ni­ties – who are ex­pect­ing up to a 3m storm surge – were or­dered to leave their homes.</p>
    <p>But en­sur­ing the preven­tion of the spread of Covid-19 in evac­u­a­tion cen­tres re­mained a chal­lenge, she added.</p>
    <p>Af­ter lash­ing the Philip­pines, Vamco is fore­cast to head to­wards Viet­nam. The coun­try’s weather agency is ex­pect­ing Vamco to ar­rive in its cen­tral re­gion on Sun­day, bring­ing in­tense rain.</p>
    <p>Floods and mud­slides over the past month have killed at least 160 peo­ple in cen­tral Viet­nam, left dozens miss­ing and dam­aged 390,000 houses, of­fi­cial data showed.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore aid agency Mercy Re­lief yes­ter­day launched a fund-rais­ing ap­peal for vic­tims of re­cent storms and floods in South-east Asia. The ap­peal runs un­til Dec 10.</p>
    <p>Mercy Re­lief chair­man Suhaimi Rafdi said in a state­ment: “Our ut­most pri­or­ity is to pro­vide emer­gency re­lief aid of food packs, clean wa­ter, hy­giene kits, blan­kets and tar­pau­lin to the af­fected com­mu­ni­ties in Viet­nam and Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is ex­pected to worsen in the com­ing weeks and our re­sponse team will be work­ing closely with our lo­cal part­ners and au­thor­i­ties to as­sess the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>The public can do­nate on­line on t h e Me r c y R e l i e f w e b s i t e www.mer­cyre­lief.org or via its giv­ing.sg page for the “South­east Asia Flood & Ty­phoon Re­lief 2020”.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can also post a cheque to or do­nate cash at Mercy Re­lief’s Lorong 1 Toa Payoh of­fice.</p>
    <p>The agency is also ac­cept­ing bank trans­fer do­na­tions to its DBS Bank cur­rent ac­count.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion can be found on the Mercy Re­lief web­site.</p>
