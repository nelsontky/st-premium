    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has sig­nalled, re­peat­edly and in the clear­est terms, that the United States should be pre­pared for a dis­puted elec­tion re­sult that could drag on for weeks or months. He is in­creas­ingly be­ing seen by an­a­lysts as gear­ing up to dis­pute the re­sult if he loses.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has sig­nalled, re­peat­edly and in the clear­est terms, that the United States should be pre­pared for a dis­puted elec­tion re­sult which could drag on for weeks or months.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has pushed the pow­ers of his of­fice be­yond the gen­er­ally ac­cepted norms that have kept pres­i­den­tial power in check and also guided peace­ful tran­si­tions – sig­nif­i­cantly fa­cil­i­tated by op­po­nents con­ced­ing de­feat – is in­creas­ingly be­ing seen as gear­ing up to dis­pute the re­sult if he loses.</p>
    <p>In June, scores of po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tists, an­a­lysts, ac­tivists and oth­ers role-played sce­nar­ios for hy­po­thet­i­cal out­comes of the Nov 3 elec­tion. It was a large group from across the board, all veter­ans of po­lit­i­cal and other bat­tles, in a pro­fes­sional ex­er­cise. They met four times for table­top war games.</p>
    <p>Say­ing “that could never hap­pen” was not an op­tion, said Dr Rosa Brooks, pro­fes­sor of constituti­onal and in­ter­na­tional law and na­tional se­cu­rity at the Ge­orge­town Univer­sity Law Cen­tre, who co-founded the group – the Tran­si­tion In­tegrity Pro­ject. “You ac­tu­ally have to think… about, ‘could they hap­pen, how could they hap­pen? If they hap­pen, what would we do?’ ” she told Bos­ton ra­dio sta­tion and Na­tional Public Ra­dio af­fil­i­ate WBUR.</p>
    <p>The group, in a 22-page con­clu­sion on Aug 4, wrote: “We as­sess with a high de­gree of like­li­hood that Novem­ber’s elec­tion will be marked by a chaotic le­gal and po­lit­i­cal land­scape. We also as­sess that Pres­i­dent Trump is likely to con­test the re­sult by both le­gal and ex­tra-le­gal means, in an at­tempt to hold on to power.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump claims mail-in vot­ing – long prac­tised in a coun­try as vast and far-flung as the US, and more im­por­tant now as the Covid-19 pan­demic may de­ter many from lin­ing up at polling sta­tions – is sub­ject to wide­spread fraud. He has even sug­gested that bal­lots will be printed in a for­eign coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mail-in vot­ing is not with­out con­tro­versy. It is in­ef­fi­cient. There have been cases of fraud. Yet mailin vot­ing fraud has never been sin­gled out as hav­ing swayed the out­come of a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Tran­si­tion In­tegrity Pro­ject’s con­clu­sions are not pre­dic­tions, but rather pos­si­bil­i­ties, Dr Brooks em­pha­sised. But the line be­tween pos­si­bil­ity and pre­dic­tion is some­times a fine one. Both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide – more aptly a chasm across which they shout but rarely listen – are con­vinced the other will steal the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The in­gre­di­ents are present for a very messy af­fair. And the very fact that such con­ver­sa­tions are tak­ing place is a re­minder of the fragility of so­ci­eties and po­lit­i­cal sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The US is in the grip of a cul­ture war, a pan­demic-in­duced eco­nomic crash, and protests against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is es­ca­lat­ing com­pe­ti­tion with China to the point where an­a­lysts worry about an ac­tual mil­i­tary clash.</p>
    <p>Last month, former Demo­cratic se­na­tor Gary Hart, an ex-pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, wrote in The New York Times: “We are not liv­ing in or­di­nary po­lit­i­cal times. Great temp­ta­tions are of­fered to a pres­i­dent faced with de­feat to… have unchecked ac­cess to dozens of ex­treme pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“Some dis­miss such con­cerns as im­prob­a­ble. But… why doubt the in­ten­tions of a Pres­i­dent who said in the White House brief­ing room in April that ‘when some­body is the Pres­i­dent of the United States, the author­ity is to­tal, and that’s the way it’s got to be?’ ”</p>
    <p>Dr Rachel Kle­in­feld, a se­nior fel­low in the democ­racy, con­flict and gov­er­nance pro­gramme at the Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace, said: “The United States is a democ­racy that’s both very old and very young. We’re the old­est democ­racy in the world and part of that means that… norms have had a long time to con­cre­tise and be built up, and what our cit­i­zens ex­pect of our lead­ers is very strong.</p>
    <p>“But we’re also a young democ­racy. We’ve re­ally only dealt with our­selves as a racially in­te­grated democ­racy since 1965 – and that’s no older than most de­colonised coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I think Amer­i­cans have long be­lieved that we’re ex­cep­tional and we’ll avoid the prob­lems that af­fect other democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>“But there’s no rea­son to be­lieve that that will hap­pen for­ever.”</p>
    <p>WHAT­EVER IT TAKES</p>
    <p>We as­sess with a high de­gree of like­li­hood that Novem­ber’s elec­tion will be marked by a chaotic le­gal and po­lit­i­cal land­scape. We also as­sess that Pres­i­dent Trump is likely to con­test the re­sult by both le­gal and ex­tra-le­gal means, in an at­tempt to ’’ hold on to power.</p>
