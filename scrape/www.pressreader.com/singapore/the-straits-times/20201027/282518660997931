    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You have a prob­lem you can­not ig­nore, so see if you can just hun­ker down and get past it. You should be able to man­age it well enough.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>It is a good time to ex­pand your au­di­ence – look for new friends, new cus­tomers or a big­ger venue. You can do it.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>A mi­nor ca­reer blip could have you pan­ick­ing, but take a mo­ment to breathe deeply. You can get past this with­out too much trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your as­sis­tance is needed and it could be al­most any­one ask­ing for it, from a dis­tant rel­a­tive to your best friend. You can help out too.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Nor­mal chan­nels of com­mu­ni­ca­tion are pep­pered with po­ems, odd rants and other cre­ative dis­plays, but it is a small price to pay for a dis­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You are see­ing big changes and you like the way they are go­ing. Leave your mark on the events of the day and show that change can be fun.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your sched­ule could get hit with un­ex­pected calls, vis­i­tors or other in­ter­rup­tions. Do not freak out when you have to skip an ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your ro­man­tic side is pow­er­ful, so in­dulge it and see if you can get your part­ner or crush to do the same. It is time for big ges­tures.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) You need to lis­ten to fables and sto­ries and fig­ure out which one best ap­plies to your sit­u­a­tion. A nar­ra­tive can set you straight.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Fall back on your in­tu­ition. One big clue could come your way early in the day and you need to act quickly to make the most of it.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) Dis­trac­tions are ev­ery­where to­day, but do not fret. Some­times, you just need to let your mind wan­der and fol­low up on dif­fer­ent ideas.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your help is cru­cial and at least one per­son needs you in a big way. Make calls and con­nect with peo­ple you have not heard from in a while.</p>
