    <p>Now that the Work­ers’ Party (WP) has 10 MPs in Par­lia­ment, it can­not just con­tinue to ques­tion and ask for changes to gov­ern­ment pol­icy, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It is also their duty to put for­ward se­ri­ous pol­icy al­ter­na­tives to be scru­ti­nised and de­bated,” Mr Wong said at a press con­fer­ence at the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) head­quar­ters in Be­dok to give the party’s read­ing of the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>He added that while the WP has told vot­ers that its aim is to pro­vide a stronger check on the PAP Gov­ern­ment – rather than to take over as the Gov­ern­ment – this is be­cause it “is a mes­sage they know vot­ers want to hear”.</p>
    <p>“The WP says that their longterm aim is to deny the PAP twothirds of the seats in Par­lia­ment,” said Mr Wong. “But I have no doubt that they want to dis­place the PAP and form the Gov­ern­ment one day</p>
    <p>– ex­cept that they find it in­con­ve­nient to ac­knowl­edge this now,” he added.</p>
    <p>The WP’s win in Sengkang GRC in the July 10 gen­eral elec­tion means it now has an un­prece­dented 10 of the 12 op­po­si­tion seats in Par­lia­ment. The re­main­ing two seats, for Non-Con­stituency MPs (NCMPs), will be taken up by Ms Hazel Poa and Mr Leong Mun Wai of the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, whose West Coast slate emerged as the best losers in the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said on the morn­ing af­ter the elec­tion that WP chief Pri­tam Singh would be for­mally des­ig­nated as the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion and given ap­pro­pri­ate staff sup­port and re­sources.</p>
    <p>PM Lee had also said that he looks for­ward to the 10 new op­po­si­tion MPs and two NCMPs par­tic­i­pat­ing in and con­tribut­ing to par­lia­men­tary de­bates, as well as to the na­tional de­bate, as Sin­ga­pore deals with the coro­n­avirus cri­sis and eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Wong said that de­tails of the sup­port to be given to Mr Singh are still be­ing worked out, and will be an­nounced by the Gov­ern­ment and Par­lia­ment when ready.</p>
    <p>He added that there is noth­ing wrong with hav­ing the am­bi­tion to one day form the Gov­ern­ment, as that is what po­lit­i­cal par­ties in par­lia­men­tary democ­ra­cies ex­ist for.</p>
    <p>“To win over vot­ers’ con­fi­dence and sup­port in or­der to win power, form the Gov­ern­ment and carry out their poli­cies – it is part of a democ­racy at work,” he said. “So we must be clear-eyed about this.”</p>
    <p>With the hus­tings over, elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives should now fo­cus on their par­lia­men­tary work, which is to scru­ti­nise and rig­or­ously de­bate not just gov­ern­ment poli­cies, but also any al­ter­na­tive poli­cies that the WP or NCMPs may wish to bring up, added Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>Part of that process en­tails iden­ti­fy­ing the costs and down­sides of any pro­posed pol­icy be­cause it is im­pos­si­ble to sat­isfy ev­ery­one, and “at the end of the day, some­one has to bear the costs”, he added.</p>
    <p>“What we need to do is to un­der­stand pol­i­cy­mak­ing is dif­fi­cult work,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It may not have the same emo­tive ap­peal as an elec­tion rally, but now we come to the hard work of gov­er­nance and gov­ern­ing Sin­ga­pore – for the good of all Sin­ga­pore­ans and for the fu­ture of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>“So we hope, whether it’s PAP or the Work­ers’ Party, we can, in Par­lia­ment, have these rig­or­ous de­bates, con­struc­tive de­bates that will en­able bet­ter poli­cies to be made for the bet­ter­ment of all.”</p>
