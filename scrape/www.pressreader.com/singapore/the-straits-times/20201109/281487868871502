    <p>When the lights at Robin­sons – one of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est home­grown depart­ment stores – are switched off for the last time, a whole era will come to an end.</p>
    <p>But while it is hard to imag­ine Or­chard Road with­out the iconic six</p>
    <p>COM­PELLING REA­SONS</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge is whether re­tail­ers can con­tin­u­ously of­fer con­sumers even more com­pelling rea­sons to dif­fer­en­ti­ate the in-store ex­pe­ri­ence from on­line shop­ping.</p>
    <p>MS ROSE TONG, Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor, say­ing the vi­brancy of Or­chard Road is “not de­pen­dent on one stake­holder alone”, given the myr­iad shop­ping and din­ing op­tions along the 2.4km stretch.</p>
    <p>TOUCH AND FEEL</p>
    <p>Some con­sumers have come to re­alise dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod that they would like to touch, feel, as­cer­tain the de­sign and qual­ity of cer­tain prod­ucts prior to mak­ing a pur­chase.</p>
    <p>MS LIM XIU RU, a lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness.</p>
    <p>She said there is still room for the phys­i­cal re­tail land­scape to thrive de­spite con­sumers in­creas­ingly shift­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>storey depart­ment store at The Heeren, some ex­perts and re­tail­ers are still pos­i­tive that Or­chard Road can bounce back as an at­trac­tive shop­ping des­ti­na­tion from the cur­rent re­tail slump.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Rose Tong said the vi­brancy of Sin­ga­pore’s most recog­nis­able shop­ping belt is “not de­pen­dent on one stake­holder alone”.</p>
    <p>The myr­iad shop­ping and din­ing op­tions along the 2.4km stretch will still at­tract those seek­ing re­tail ther­apy, said Ms Tong.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge is whether re­tail­ers can con­tin­u­ously of­fer con­sumers even more com­pelling rea­sons to dif­fer­en­ti­ate the in-store ex­pe­ri­ence from on­line shop­ping,” she added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh from the Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School warned that the clo­sure of Robin­sons could be the start of a domino ef­fect for other sim­i­lar large-scale stores along Or­chard Road. He cited Marks & Spencer at Whee­lock Place – which shares the same par­ent in the Al-Fut­taim group as Robin­sons – Ise­tan at Shaw House and Takashimay­a at Ngee Ann City as ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing on the hori­zon, busi­nesses that can prop­erly man­age their busi­ness model and prod­uct of­fer­ings to suit their tar­get mar­ket could rise above the cur­rent re­tail slump, said Prof Loh.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons an­nounced the im­pend­ing clo­sure of its last two stores here at the Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre on Oct 30, cit­ing a range of fac­tors in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Xiu Ru, a lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness, said that while con­sumers are in­creas­ingly shift­ing on­line, there is still room for the phys­i­cal re­tail land­scape to thrive.</p>
    <p>“Some con­sumers have come to re­alise dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod that they would like to touch, feel, as­cer­tain the de­sign and qual­ity of cer­tain prod­ucts prior to mak­ing a pur­chase,” she said.</p>
    <p>Last year, the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity un­veiled plans to trans­form Or­chard Road into a “life­style des­ti­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>The strip will be di­vided into four sub-precincts each with its own key draw, such as arts and cul­ture, a youth hub and a gar­den dis­trict.</p>
    <p>As part of the re­ju­ve­na­tion ef­forts, an open-air carpark i n Grange Road will be re­de­vel­oped to house an in­de­pen­dent cin­ema, hawker stalls and mul­ti­ple event spa­ces to en­sure the site is ac­tive all year round.</p>
    <p>The project by Lendlease Global Com­mer­cial Reit is es­ti­mated to cost around $10 mil­lion and is set to be op­er­a­tional in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2022.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh Zil­ing, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of lo­cal beauty brand Re:erth, said she has “full faith” in the fu­ture of Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>Re:erth opened its flag­ship bou­tique at Tangs Plaza in Au­gust this year and also has two coun­ters at De­sign Or­chard and The AC Raf­fles at Raf­fles Ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Though foot­fall is low com­pared with pre-Covid-19 days, Ms Toh said its out­lets have seen an in­crease in do­mes­tic shop­pers in re­cent months. On­line sales make up around 70 per cent of the brand’s to­tal sales.</p>
    <p>“While we have to weather the storms of global travel re­stric­tions and the eco­nomic down­turn, the rays of sun­light peek­ing through is that the ‘sup­port lo­cal’ move­ment is grow­ing stronger ev­ery day,” she said.</p>
