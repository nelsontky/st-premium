    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients in US hos­pi­tals has sur­passed 100,000 for the first time, nearly dou­ble the num­ber dur­ing the</p>
    <p>first wave of the coro­n­avirus. With hos­pi­tals in some places near­ing ca­pac­ity, and if states are un­able to curb the surge of new cases, ex­perts said that the health sys­tem in the coun­try could soon be over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • The num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients in US hos­pi­tals has sur­passed 100,000 for the first time, nearly dou­ble the num­ber from spring dur­ing the coro­n­avirus’ deadly first wave, ac­cord­ing to the Covid Track­ing Project.</p>
    <p>The Track­ing Project put the num­ber of pa­tients at 100,226 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The re­lent­less rise in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions fol­lows a rapid climb in new cases, which now num­ber more than one mil­lion ev­ery week. And deaths, a so-called lag­ging in­di­ca­tor that tends to spike af­ter a rise in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, have also been ris­ing fast. They have now passed 273,000 in the United States.</p>
    <p>The num­bers paint a sober­ing pic­ture of what the next few weeks may look like, ex­perts said. Hos­pi­tals in some places are near­ing ca­pac­ity, and if states are un­able to curb the surge in new in­fec­tions, those sys­tems could soon be­come over­whelmed, as New York was in the spring.</p>
    <p>“Any think­ing per­son has to be wor­ried,” said Dr Philip Lan­dri­gan, di­rec­tor of a global pub­lic health pro­gramme at Bos­ton Col­lege. “That we have so many hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions speaks to the fact that we have done a very poor job of con­trol­ling this pan­demic. It is spread­ing very rapidly, and i n many places, it is ba­si­cally spread­ing out of con­trol.” Still, the sit­u­a­tion to­day is dif­fer­ent from the spring.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions are climb­ing steadily, but they are not keep­ing pace with the soar­ing num­ber of cases. The share of peo­ple in­fected with the coro­n­avirus who are ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tals has been shrink­ing, a twist in the data for which ex­perts of­fer dif­fer­ent the­o­ries.</p>
    <p>One ex­pla­na­tion is test­ing. Many more peo­ple to­day are get­ting tested than at the start of the pan­demic, and that is turn­ing up many more mild cases. And many of those who do con­tract the virus be­come far less sick, said Dr Caitlin Rivers, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Johns Hopkins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dr Rivers does not be­lieve that the share of peo­ple who are sick enough to need hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion has changed that much. It is just that now they are spread across the coun­try, un­like in the spring, when they were con­cen­trated in the New York and New Eng­land re­gions.</p>
    <p>“Now we can see more of the ice­berg,” she said. “This spring, you got a test be­cause you were in the hospi­tal and you were al­ready sick. Now you can get tested even if you don’t have symp­toms. We are adding to the de­nom­i­na­tor, but many of those peo­ple were never re­ally des­tined for the nu­mer­a­tor.”</p>
    <p>But oth­ers said the shift was more than just be­cause of in­creased test­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Oster­holm, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the Univer­sity of Min­nesota, who is on Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s ad­vi­sory panel for the pan­demic, said that he had seen a down­turn in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions over the past few weeks but that he sus­pected it re­flected an at­tempt by hos­pi­tals to man­age ris­ing caseloads.</p>
    <p>“Pa­tients that would have been hos­pi­talised last month to­day are be­ing sent home and watched closely,” Dr Oster­holm said. “Many of our health­care sys­tems are lit­er­ally on the edge. They are in a sense triag­ing, keep­ing only the most se­verely ill pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Com­pli­cat­ing the sit­u­a­tion for hos­pi­tals is the fact that with cases now ex­plod­ing in nearly all parts of the coun­try, health­care work­ers can­not be brought from other states to help, he said.</p>
    <p>The next two weeks will be crit­i­cal, Dr Oster­holm said.</p>
    <p>“If we get this Thanks­giv­ing surge, we will have hos­pi­tals hit their case cliff,” he said. “Then you can’t have more hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions be­cause there won’t be enough health­care pro­fes­sion­als to care for them.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the head of the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) warned on Wed­nes­day that the pan­demic will pose the grimmest health cri­sis yet for the coun­try over the next few months, be­fore vac­cines be­come widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>Dr Robert Red­field, di­rec­tor of the CDC, urged stricter ad­her­ence to safety pre­cau­tions such as wear­ing face cov­er­ings, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and good hand hy­giene to slow the spread of the virus now claim­ing well over 2,000 US lives a day.</p>
    <p>His sober mes­sage fol­lowed Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day ob­ser­vances in which mil­lions of Amer­i­cans dis­re­garded warn­ings to avoid travel and large gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is that De­cem­ber, Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary are go­ing to be rough times,” Dr Red­field told a live-stream pre­sen­ta­tion hosted by the US Cham­ber of Commerce Foun­da­tion. “I ac­tu­ally be­lieve they’re go­ing to be the most dif­fi­cult time in the pub­lic health his­tory of this na­tion.”</p>
