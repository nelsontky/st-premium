    <p>WASH­ING­TON/LON­DON • Moderna, the US biotech firm, said on Tues­day that it would en­ter the fi­nal stage of hu­man tri­als for its Covid-19 vac­cine on July 27, to test how well it pro­tects peo­ple in the real world.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came as the re­sults from an ear­lier trial, in­tended to prove the vac­cine was safe and trig­gered an­ti­body pro­duc­tion, were pub­lished.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing phase three trial will re­cruit 30,000 par­tic­i­pants in the United States, with half to re­ceive the vac­cine at 100 mi­cro­gram dose lev­els, and the other half to re­ceive a placebo.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers will then track the par­tic­i­pants over two years to de­ter­mine whether they are pro­tected against in­fec­tion by the virus.</p>
    <p>Or, if they do get in­fected, whether the vac­cine pre­vents symp­toms from de­vel­op­ing.</p>
    <p>If they do get symp­toms, the vac­cine can still be con­sid­ered a suc­cess if it stops se­vere cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The study should run un­til Oct 27, 2022, but pre­lim­i­nary re­sults should be avail­able long be­fore that date.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came shortly af­ter the New Eng­land Jour­nal of Medicine pub­lished re­sults from the first stage of Moderna’s vac­cine trial, which showed that the first 45 par­tic­i­pants all de­vel­oped an­ti­bod­ies to the virus.</p>
    <p>Moderna is con­sid­ered to be in a lead­ing po­si­tion in the global race to find a vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But sci­en­tists cau­tion that the first vac­cines to come on the mar­ket may not be the most ef­fec­tive or the safest.</p>
    <p>The “in­terim re­sults” that Moderna pub­lished in May from the first stages of its trial were hailed to be “en­cour­ag­ing” by Dr An­thony Fauci, the di­rec­tor of the US Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, a co-de­vel­oper of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>But some in the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity said they would re­serve judg­ment un­til they saw the full re­sults in peer-re­viewed form.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in the UK, pos­i­tive news on ini­tial tri­als of the Univer­sity of Oxford’s po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine that has been li­censed to As­traZeneca could be an­nounced as soon as to­day, ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish news chan­nel ITV’s po­lit­i­cal ed­i­tor Robert Pe­ston, cit­ing a source.</p>
    <p>The pro­ject has started phase three of the hu­man tri­als to as­sess how the vac­cine works in a large num­ber of peo­ple over the age of 18, but has yet to re­port phase one trial re­sults.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ers of the vac­cine ear­lier this month said they were en­cour­aged by the i mmune re­sponse they had seen in tri­als so far.</p>
