    <p>Sci­en­tists here have de­vel­oped an i mproved Covid-19 test kit that can de­liver re­sults more quickly – halv­ing pro­cess­ing time from about four hours to less than two.</p>
    <p>The new kit also uses fewer raw ma­te­ri­als that are lim­ited in sup­ply dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The di­rect poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test, called Res­o­lute, was the re­sult of a joint project by DSO Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries and the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Research (A*Star) an­nounced yes­ter­day. A PCR test de­tects the pres­ence of vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial from a sam­ple taken from a pa­tient, such as from the nose or back of the throat.</p>
    <p>Un­like the stan­dard PCR test, Res­o­lute can be con­ducted with a ba­sic lab­o­ra­tory set-up and en­trylevel tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>The process is also safer for tech­ni­cians. Ex­po­sure to the virus is re­duced as tech­ni­cians no longer need to mix the sam­ple with reagents, and go through sev­eral rounds of “wash­ing” with reagents, to ex­tract a ge­netic ma­te­rial for anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>With Res­o­lute, tech­ni­cians just need to add the pa­tient’s sam­ple to a spe­cially for­mu­lated pre-mixed so­lu­tion, be­fore it is placed into the PCR ma­chine for anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>With ear­lier re­sults, pa­tients can be given med­i­cal treat­ment more quickly if needed.</p>
    <p>The cost of each Res­o­lute kit is ex­pected to be com­pet­i­tive com­pared with stan­dard PCR test kits.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng Sock Hoon, lab­o­ra­tory di­rec­tor of the ver­i­fi­ca­tion and at­tri­bu­tion lab­o­ra­tory at DSO, said there will be cost sav­ings as less man­power and re­sources will be re­quired for ge­netic ma­te­rial ex­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Res­o­lute re­ceived pro­vi­sional au­tho­ri­sa­tion from the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity in April.</p>
    <p>The Di­ag­nos­tic De­vel­op­ment Hub, a na­tional plat­form hosted by A*Star, is work­ing with a lo­cal medtech com­pany to pro­duce and de­ploy it, al­though no time­line was given.</p>
    <p>The col­lab­o­ra­tion on Res­o­lute was part of a strate­gic part­ner­ship be­tween DSO and A*Star that was inked ear­lier this year. It was the first time both or­gan­i­sa­tions have come to­gether to de­velop a prod­uct for pub­lic health needs.</p>
    <p>A*Star chief ex­ec­u­tive Fred­er­ick Chew said that Res­o­lute was a vi­tal ad­di­tion to Sin­ga­pore’s test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>DSO chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheong Chee Hoo said: “We are able... to quickly de­velop this ca­pa­bil­ity in less than three months to strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Dr Weng Ruifen, chief of prod­uct de­vel­op­ment and project man­age­ment for the Di­ag­nos­tics De­vel­op­ment Hub at A*Star, said that with Res­o­lute, raw ma­te­rial needs are diver­si­fied.</p>
    <p>“This in­creases our re­silience in the fight against Covid-19,” said Dr Weng.</p>
    <p>Un­like the stan­dard PCR test, Res­o­lute can be con­ducted with a ba­sic lab­o­ra­tory set-up and en­try-level tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>The process is also safer for tech­ni­cians. Ex­po­sure to the virus is re­duced as tech­ni­cians no longer need to mix the sam­ple with reagents, and go through sev­eral rounds of “wash­ing” with reagents, to ex­tract a ge­netic ma­te­rial for anal­y­sis.</p>
