    <p>The best an­ti­dote to stage fright, says erhu player Deb­o­rah Siok, 24, is to be over-pre­pared.</p>
    <p>It was this mind­set which got her through the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Mu­sic Com­pe­ti­tion a fort­night ago, when her rous­ing per­for­mance of Wang Dan­hong’s erhu con­certo Aman­nisha won her the top prize of $10,000.</p>
    <p>“When I re­hearse, I think of ev­ery sin­gle de­tail that might pos­si­bly dis­tract me on stage. The mo­ment I found out we had to wear masks to per­form, I started prac­tis­ing with my mask on,” says the mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Youth Chi­nese Orches­tra (SNYCO). Breath­ing ex­er­cises and ad­vice from her men­tor – SCO’s con­cert­mas­ter Li Baoshun – also helped, even though she still felt ner­vous.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial mu­sic con­test, pre­vi­ously known as the Na­tional Chi­nese Mu­sic Com­pe­ti­tion, aims to de­velop the per­form­ing skills of young mu­si­cians and dis­cover new tal­ent.</p>
    <p>It was the first time the con­test was or­gan­ised solely by the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra (SCO) and had both lo­cal ad­ju­di­ca­tors present on site and over­seas ad­ju­di­ca­tors tun­ing in via a live stream.</p>
    <p>There were a to­tal of 27 ad­ju­di­ca­tors, 18 lo­cal and nine over­seas, judg­ing for dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories and sec­tions.</p>
    <p>The 15-day com­pe­ti­tion, which ended on Dec 12, took place at the Sin­ga­pore Con­fer­ence Hall and had more than 330 con­tes­tants in solo and en­sem­ble cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Siok had won first prize in the com­pe­ti­tion’s erhu open cat­e­gory in 2018. This year, she pipped erhu player Li Siyu, 19, and guzheng player Fu Zifei, 20, to the top award in the solo grand cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Siok’s in­ter­est in mu­sic be­gan at an early age. The Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts grad­u­ate re­calls watch­ing the 12 Girls Band play at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium in 2004. Her father was a fan of the Chi­nese group, who jux­ta­pose sounds of erhu, pipa, yangqin and guzheng with Western pop.</p>
    <p>The bud­ding mu­si­cian, who then played only the piano, was fas­ci­nated. In Pri­mary 3, she picked up the erhu in her school’s Chi­nese orches­tra. Pri­vate les­sons with erhu mas­ter Zhang Yu Ming fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>To­day, Siok – who also has a Grade 8 in piano – is a part-time erhu teacher. She plans to save most of her prize money, but might also add a new erhu to her col­lec­tion of Chi­nese bowed string in­stru­ments. She has about 20 erhu, gaohu and zhonghu.</p>
    <p>She also hopes peo­ple’s per­cep­tions of Chi­nese mu­sic – and the idea that be­ing a mu­si­cian is not a vi­able ca­reer – will change.</p>
    <p>She says: “There is pub­lic per­cep­tion that mu­sic is not a prof­itable route... Hope­fully, more young peo­ple will pur­sue mu­sic and keep this tra­di­tion alive.”</p>
    <p>Siok, the youngest of three chil­dren, is the only mu­si­cian in her fam­ily. Her father works in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try and her mother is a se­condary school teacher. Both are sup­port­ive of her choice of ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the SCO would be the “ul­ti­mate dream”, she says, adding that she will be ap­ply­ing to do a mas­ter’s at Bei­jing’s Cen­tral Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Mu­sic has en­riched her life.</p>
    <p>“It has taught me dis­ci­pline, to be a bet­ter lis­tener and to be hum­ble. You can­not be com­pla­cent or ar­ro­gant when you learn an in­stru­ment.”</p>
