    <p>• The Euro­pean Union has agreed to move ahead with sanc­tions against Rus­sian of­fi­cials over the nerve agent poi­son­ing of op­po­si­tion leader Alexei Navalny, fur­ther com­pli­cat­ing al­ready fraught ties with Moscow.</p>
    <p>For­eign min­is­ters meet­ing in Lux­em­bourg on Mon­day agreed to sanc­tions pro­pos­als made last week by France and Ger­many, which said Rus­sia was re­spon­si­ble for the poi­son­ing of Mr Navalny with Novi­chok, the chem­i­cal weapon also used in a 2018 at­tack on a Rus­sian de­fec­tor in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters also said they were ready to sanc­tion Be­larus leader Alexan­der Lukashenko, as the bloc seeks to step up pres­sure over his regime’s crack­down on pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Ger­many and France last week ac­cused Moscow of re­spon­si­bil­ity for poi­son­ing Mr Navalny with Sovi­et­de­vel­oped Novi­chok, say­ing “no cred­i­ble ex­pla­na­tion has been pro­vided by Rus­sia”.</p>
    <p>Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas wel­comed the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve it is of para­mount im­por­tance in the light of such a se­ri­ous crime – a vi­o­la­tion of in­ter­na­tional law and the chem­i­cal weapons con­ven­tion – that the Euro­pean Union shows unity, and it has done so to­day,” he said.</p>
    <p>EU diplo­matic chief Josep Bor­rell said tech­ni­cal work would now be­gin, based on ev­i­dence pro­vided by France and Ger­many, to pre­pare the sanc­tions list­ings, though he did not say how many peo­ple and en­ti­ties would be tar­geted.</p>
    <p>Paris and Ber­lin last week said they would push for sanc­tions tar­get­ing “in­di­vid­u­als deemed re­spon­si­ble for this crime and breach of in­ter­na­tional norms, based on their of­fi­cial func­tion, as well as an en­tity in­volved i n the Novi­chok pro­gramme”.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures re­lated to the Navalny case will be made un­der the EU’s chem­i­cal weapons sanc­tions frame­work, which min­is­ters ex­tended by a year on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Four mem­bers of Rus­sia’s mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence were hit with travel bans and as­set freezes un­der this frame­work for their role in the Novi­chok poi­son­ing of for­mer spy Sergei Skri­pal and his daugh­ter in Sal­is­bury, Eng­land, in 2018.</p>
    <p>The frame­work has also been used against Syr­ian of­fi­cials for car­ry­ing out chem­i­cal weapons at­tacks on their civil war foes.</p>
    <p>The push for puni­tive ac­tion in the Navalny case came af­ter the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for the Pro­hi­bi­tion of Chem­i­cal Weapons, the UN’s chem­i­cal weapons watch­dog, con­firmed the find­ing by Ger­many, France and Swe­den that the Rus­sian ac­tivist was poi­soned by a nerve agent from the Novi­chok group.</p>
    <p>On Be­larus, Mr Bor­rell said the de­ci­sion to line up sanc­tions against Mr Lukashenko and some mem­bers of his en­tourage had come in re­sponse to the “evolv­ing sit­u­a­tion” on the ground – and be­cause the regime was re­fus­ing to ne­go­ti­ate with the op­po­si­tion.</p>
