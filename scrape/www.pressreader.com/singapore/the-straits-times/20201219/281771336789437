    <p>KATSINA • Se­cu­rity forces have res­cued nearly 350 school­boys who had been kid­napped in north-western Nige­ria and taken into a vast for­est, the gover­nor of Katsina state said, with some re­turn­ing home yes­ter­day, bring­ing relief to many fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>It was not i mme­di­ately clear whether all the miss­ing boys had been re­cov­ered in Thurs­day’s res­cue.</p>
    <p>“I think we have re­cov­ered most of the boys,” Gover­nor Aminu Bello Masari said in a tele­vised in­ter­view with state chan­nel NTA.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, dozens of the res­cued school­boys ar­rived back home, many of them bare­foot and clutch­ing blan­kets.</p>
    <p>Tele­vi­sion pic­tures showed the boys, dressed in dusty clothes and light green uni­forms and look­ing weary but oth­er­wise well, get­ting off buses in the city of Katsina and walk­ing to a govern­ment build­ing.</p>
    <p>One of them, with flecks of dried mud on his face, told Chan­nels TV the cap­tors had fed them bread and cas­sava.</p>
    <p>“It was cold,” he told the re­porter. Asked how he had felt when the bus ar­rived in Katsina, he said “I was re­ally happy”, and broke into a smile.</p>
    <p>On Friday night last week, gun­men raided the Govern­ment Sci­ence Se­condary School in Katsina on mo­tor­bikes and marched the boys into Rugu for­est, in the big­gest such in­ci­dent in the law­less re­gion in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Mr Masari said a to­tal of 344 boys held in the for­est had been freed in neigh­bour­ing Zam­fara state. He did not say how many had been miss­ing or how they were freed.</p>
    <p>Mr Masari said se­cu­rity forces had cor­doned off the area where the boys were be­ing held and were given instructio­ns not to shoot.</p>
    <p>“We thank God that they took our ad­vice and not a sin­gle shot was fired,” he said.</p>
    <p>The ab­duc­tion gripped a coun­try al­ready in­censed by widespread in­se­cu­rity and evoked mem­o­ries of Is­lamist mil­i­tant group Boko Haram’s 2014 kid­nap­ping of more than 270 school­girls in the north­east­ern town of Chi­bok. Six years on, only about half of the girls have been found or freed. Oth­ers were mar­ried off to fighters, while some are as­sumed to be dead.</p>
    <p>Hours be­fore the res­cue of the boys was an­nounced, a video started cir­cu­lat­ing online pur­port­edly show­ing Boko Haram mil­i­tants with some of the boys. Reuters was un­able to ver­ify the au­then­tic­ity of the footage or who re­leased it.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Muham­madu Buhari wel­comed the stu­dents’ re­lease and asked for pa­tience while his ad­min­is­tra­tion dealt with se­cu­rity is­sues. “We have a lot of work to do,” he said in a state­ment, but added: “We will deal with all that.”</p>
    <p>The ab­duc­tion was awk­ward for Mr Buhari, who comes from Katsina and who has re­peat­edly said that Boko Haram has been “tech­ni­cally de­feated”.</p>
    <p>Boko Haram claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for the kid­nap­ping in an un­ver­i­fied au­dio record­ing.</p>
    <p>The video, which fea­tured Boko Haram’s em­blem, showed a group of boys plead­ing: “Help us, help us.” The fa­ther of one of the miss­ing boys, who gave only his first name Umar, said his son, Shamsu Ibrahim, was one of the boys who was heard speaking in the video.</p>
    <p>Boko Haram has a his­tory of turn­ing cap­tives into Is­lamist fighters. If its claims are true, its in­volve­ment i n north-western Nige­ria marks a ge­o­graph­i­cal ex­pan­sion in its ac­tiv­i­ties. But it could have pur­chased the boys from lo­cal crim­i­nal gangs with which it has been build­ing ties.</p>
    <p>In the north-east, Boko Haram and its off­shoot, Is­lamic State West Africa Province, have waged a decade-long in­sur­gency es­ti­mated to have dis­placed about two mil­lion peo­ple and killed more than 30,000 oth­ers.</p>
    <p>They want to cre­ate states based on their ex­treme in­ter­pre­ta­tion of Is­lamic syariah law.</p>
    <p>Mr Buhari, a for­mer mil­i­tary ruler, was elected in 2015 in large part due to his pledge to crush the in­sur­gency. Un­der his pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Good­luck Jonathan, Boko Haram grew in strength and con­trolled ter­ri­tory around the size of Bel­gium.</p>
