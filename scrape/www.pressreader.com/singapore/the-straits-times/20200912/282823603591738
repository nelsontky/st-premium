    <p>If Sin­ga­pore­ans have not warmed up to sta­tion wag­ons, it is prob­a­bly be­cause there are not enough good­look­ing and ver­sa­tile ones around. Like the lat­est Audi A6 Avant you see here.</p>
    <p>Like most cars, the A6 Avant has grown in size – it is now al­most 5m long and 1.9m wide. In other cars, size does not al­ways trans­late to good things. But in a sta­tion wagon, it is wel­come.</p>
    <p>The Audi’s pow­ered tail­gate opens to re­veal an ex­pan­sive stowage area mea­sur­ing 565 litres, (1,680 litres with rear seats down), with more stor­age be­neath the floor board. Its wide and flat sur­face comes with ad­justable net­ting to se­cure loose items, and a re­tractable screen sep­a­rates the boot from the cabin.</p>
    <p>Just look­ing at it makes you want to head straight to Ikea. Stock­ing up on pro­vi­sions? This car is per­fect for the job. And if you have a big dog, it will be quite comfy back there as you head for the beach, with its leash nicely se­cured to one of many an­chor points.</p>
    <p>The big Avant is not too shoddy as a peo­ple car­rier ei­ther. With a wheel­base of 2,924mm, it of­fers plenty of cabin space.</p>
    <p>Al­though it is a 2-litre vari­ant, the car is pretty well-equipped. Seats are wrapped in soft Mi­lano leather, doors have auto soft-clos­ing func­tion, rear oc­cu­pants have ad­justable air-con­di­tion­ing vents and the driver gets a 360-de­gree cam­era to as­sist in park­ing.</p>
    <p>In­side, the car is al­most in­dis­tin­guish­able from its 3-litre sib­ling.</p>
    <p>Un­less of course, you are be­hind the wheel. The 2-litre tur­bocharged en­gine makes 190hp and 320Nm of torque, which would have been quite ad­e­quate in a smaller car. But the A6 is a big car which weighs in ex­cess of 1.5 tonnes.</p>
    <p>Power goes to the front wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch trans­mis­sion. De­liv­ery is smooth, if some­what leisurely.</p>
    <p>Some sem­blance of ur­gency ar­rives if you flick the gear lever down for Sport. Oth­er­wise, the car re­quires a fair amount of stomp­ing to get it up to a trot.</p>
    <p>The good thing is that it is rel­a­tively fuel-ef­fi­cient. The test-car av­er­ages 8.5 litres/100km– not quite the 6.3 litres Audi de­clares, but bet­ter than the 10 litres/100km a car of its size would nor­mally achieve. This is thanks to its 12-volt mild hy­brid sys­tem and its B-cy­cle en­gine.</p>
    <p>Be­ing ap­pre­cia­bly lighter than its 3-litre sib­ling, the A6 Avant 2.0 has a breezier han­dling.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing fast, wide cor­ners, you will not feel as if you have to wres­tle with its heft. But body roll is ob­vi­ous in tighter turns. That the car would ben­e­fit from rear-wheel steer­ing is also clear.</p>
    <p>Ride com­fort is high, though. The chas­sis is clearly com­fort-bi­ased, mak­ing the ride soft and slightly floaty. This, how­ever, does not gel well with the thump­ing noises from the wheels as they go over road un­even­ness.</p>
    <p>So, the A6 Avant 2.0 of­fers prac­ti­cal­ity and good looks, but falls a lit­tle short on driv­ing plea­sure.</p>
    <p>Well, two out of three ain’t bad.</p>
