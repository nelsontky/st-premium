    <p>Af­ter as­sum­ing his Supreme Court role, he was ap­pointed by the Chief Jus­tice to man­age the in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty list of the High Court, and worked on re­view­ing the in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty dis­pute res­o­lu­tion sys­tem in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty cases, he has ex­pe­ri­ence with cases re­lated to con­tract, tort and neg­li­gence mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Gill grad­u­ated from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore with a Bach­e­lor of Laws with Hon­ours in 1983.</p>
    <p>With his ap­point­ment, the Supreme Court will have a to­tal of 25 judges, four judicial com­mis­sion­ers, four se­nior judges and 17 in­ter­na­tional judges.</p>
