    <p>When he fin­ished ninth in his first se­ries six months ago, it pro­vided Pushan Reddy Vu­tukur the leap of faith in his game.</p>
    <p>And it came as no sur­prise that the 11-year-old Feng­shan Pri­mary School pupil claimed the sec­ond leg of the SGAMandai Ju­nior Golf Se­ries at the Ex­ec­u­tive Course on Sept 9.</p>
    <p>Only two years into the game, af­ter hav­ing been en­cour­aged by his dad Praveen Reddy, Pushan won the boys’ event with 16 sta­ble­ford points over nine holes, shoot­ing a two-over 31.</p>
    <p>Trained by SG­golf coach Joshua Yeo and play­ing reg­u­larly with his dad, both Pro­fi­ciency Cer­tifi­cate hold­ers, Pushan is on course to do him­self proud in golf and stud­ies, be­ing among the top pupils in his Pri­mary Five co­hort.</p>
    <p>He plays twice a month and goes to the Mandai Range twice a week with his dad.</p>
    <p>Through dad’s i nflu­ence, Pushan lists Tiger Woods as his favourite golfer.</p>
    <p>Praveen, a se­nior project man­ager at Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, said that he would fully back his son in his in­ter­est in golf.</p>
    <p>In the girls’ sec­tion, Aamiya Koul won the ti­tle with 13 sta­ble­ford points over nine holes. In the Na­tional Rank­ing Games at Changi Golf Club on Sept 10 and 11 for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Squad mem­bers, Wong Qi Wen won the men’s divi­sion with a 36-hole to­tal of one-un­der 135 while Inez Ng won the women’s sec­tion with an eight over 144 to­tal.</p>
