    <p>Two men ac­cused of tam­per­ing with elec­tion posters in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents were charged in a district court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two Sin­ga­pore­ans – Lim Song Huat, 48, and Con­stan­tine Paul, 51 – were charged with of­fences un­der the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral elec­tion in Sin­ga­pore was held on July 10.</p>
    <p>Lim, who faces three charges, was in Wood­lands Street 13 at around 9.30am on July 3, dur­ing the cam­paign­ing pe­riod, when he al­legedly used a black pen to draw a hor­i­zon­tal line across a Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) poster hung on a lamp post.</p>
    <p>He is also ac­cused of tear­ing a sec­ond PAP poster with his hands about 15 min­utes later.</p>
    <p>Lim is said to have then de­stroyed a third PAP poster by tear­ing it at 9.47am.</p>
    <p>Paul, who faces two charges, al­legedly re­moved two Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) posters from lamp posts in Bukit Ba­tok East Av­enue 5 at around 8pm on June 30.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier state­ment, the po­lice said they ini­ti­ated in­ves­ti­ga­tions af­ter of­fi­cers came across a PSP elec­tion poster at the foot of a lamp post in Bukit Ba­tok East Av­enue 5 at about 1.50am on July 1.</p>
    <p>Later that day, the PSP made a po­lice re­port about an­other dam­aged party elec­tion poster in the same road.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post in July, PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock shared pho­tos of the posters – fea­tur­ing the party’s slate for Chua Chu Kang GRC – ly­ing on a grass verge.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “In the heat of cam­paign­ing, our emo­tions can get car­ried away... Let’s re­mem­ber to keep cool heads.”</p>
    <p>The PAP team in Alju­nied GRC had also posted on its Face­book page a pic­ture of a torn PAP poster fea­tur­ing its slate for the group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency.</p>
    <p>The court heard yes­ter­day that Paul and Lim in­tend to plead guilty to their of­fences at their next court ap­pear­ance on Jan 7 next year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Act, it is an of­fence for any per­son to al­ter, re­move, de­stroy, oblit­er­ate or de­face elec­tion posters or ban­ners.</p>
    <p>For each charge, an of­fender can be jailed for up to a year or fined up to $1,000.</p>
