    <p>Al­though the days of tra­di­tional kam­pungs are over, the spirit lives on within some com­mu­ni­ties here.</p>
    <p>In Queen­stown, rental flat res­i­dents in Mei Ling Street know that when they need help, whether in terms of fi­nances, food or fill­ing up forms, they can look for their “kam­pung head”, Mr Zulk­i­fli Atnawi.</p>
    <p>A re­tired cleaner, Mr Zulk­i­fli, 60, spends his days help­ing others, by buy­ing food and gro­ceries for those in need, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>He is no stranger to tough times him­self. When his four chil­dren were younger, some of the fam­ily mem­bers had to sleep at the void deck for a time be­cause Mr Zulk­i­fli had lost his job as a tech­ni­cian and sold the fam­ily flat. He is now di­vorced and lives in a two-room rental flat with his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>His chil­dren, who are aged be­tween 24 and 28, are spread­ing that kam­pung spirit through an ini­tia­tive they call Project Hills.</p>
    <p>In April, when Sin­ga­pore was in cir­cuit breaker mode and most peo­ple were cooped up at home, Mr Zulk­i­fli and his chil­dren knew that the cir­cum­stances were tough on their neigh­bours, and made sure to check in on them.</p>
    <p>Be­yond giv­ing out gro­ceries to im­me­di­ate neigh­bours, Mr Zulk­i­fli’s chil­dren re­cruited vol­un­teers and started go­ing to rental flats in other parts of Queen­stown, such as Stir­ling Road, and far­ther afield in Kim Tian Road in Tiong Bahru.</p>
    <p>This ini­tia­tive, which was started in April, aims to help those in need who may have slipped through the cracks. Vol­un­teers link them up with the au­thor­i­ties and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions which can pro­vide as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>About 70 vol­un­teers are i nvolved in Project Hills, and they visit res­i­dents of the var­i­ous es­tates with Mr Zulk­i­fli, dis­tribut­ing items and help­ing with home re­pairs and other im­me­di­ate needs.</p>
    <p>Mr Zulk­i­fli said: “The good­ness of man is not mea­sured by his work, sta­tus or do­na­tions... It is about how much you help others.”</p>
