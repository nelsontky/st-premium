    <p>Dengue con­tin­ues to be a threat as the num­ber of weekly cases re­ported re­mains high amid an in­crease in the Aedes ae­gypti mos­quito pop­u­la­tion, said the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It has been hov­er­ing at around 500 to 600 cases per week for the past five weeks.</p>
    <p>With the swell in the Aedes ae­gypti pop­u­la­tion, Sin­ga­pore could face the threat of an­other surge in dengue cases in the com­ing months, NEA added.</p>
    <p>It noted that since the start of last month, the pop­u­la­tion of th­ese dengue-caus­ing in­sects has risen by 26 per cent over seven con­sec­u­tive weeks.</p>
    <p>Lat­est fig­ures show a slide in the num­ber of weekly cases.</p>
    <p>But the de­crease of about 5 per cent in the past week re­flects a slower rate of de­cline, NEA said.</p>
    <p>In all, 32,806 dengue cases have been re­ported in Sin­ga­pore this year as of Thurs­day, with 565 cases re­ported last week.</p>
    <p>NEA also noted that dengue cases and mos­quito breed­ing are more likely in homes in landed res­i­den­tial es­tates.</p>
    <p>The dengue in­ci­dence rate is three to six times higher for res­i­dents liv­ing in landed homes than for those in pri­vate high­rise apart­ments and Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>Be­tween J an­uary and last month, the num­ber of dengue cases i n l anded prop­er­ties made up about 25 per cent of the to­tal num­ber of cases in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents liv­ing i n l anded prop­er­ties are urged by NEA to take mea­sures to pre­vent mos­quito breed­ing, such as cover­ing any wa­ter stor­age con­tain­ers and clear­ing roof gut­ters.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of dengue clus­ters has fallen by 15 clus­ters from the pre­vi­ous week, as of Thurs­day, to 162 clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Four dengue clus­ters were also closed last week af­ter no cases were de­tected for 14 days from the last case’s on­set of symp­toms. They were in Changi Road, Bis­han Street 11, Carp­mael Road near Joo Chiat and May Road near Wham­poa.</p>
    <p>Over­all, 94 per cent of dengue clus­ters re­ported since the be­gin­ning of the year have been closed, said NEA.</p>
    <p>Still, the to­tal num­ber of dengue clus­ters re­mains high, with con­trol oper­a­tions on­go­ing at five clus­ters, it added.</p>
