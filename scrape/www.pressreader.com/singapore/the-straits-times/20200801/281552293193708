    <p>The po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing 85 peo­ple in­volved in 112 scam cases, where the vic­tims lost more than $716,000.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter a three-day op­er­a­tion con­ducted be­tween Mon­day and Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The sus­pects – 56 men and 29 women – are as­sist­ing with in­ves­ti­ga­tions for sus­pected in­volve­ment in cheat­ing or money laun­der­ing. They are aged be­tween 19 and 71.</p>
    <p>Most of the sus­pects are be­lieved to have acted as money mules who re­ceived and trans­ferred il­le­gal funds on be­half of crim­i­nal syn­di­cates, said the po­lice yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Other sus­pects are be­lieved to have posed as on­line sell­ers and did not de­liver the prod­ucts to buy­ers af­ter re­ceiv­ing pay­ment.</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that tick­ets to at­trac­tions, mo­bile phones and ho­tel room book­ings were some of the com­mon items that scammers use to en­tice their vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Vic­tims of these scams come across ad­ver­tise­ments on on­line shop­ping plat­forms and make pay­ment trans­fers for items.</p>
    <p>Some never re­ceived the items they paid for. Oth­ers who bought tick­ets to at­trac­tions or ho­tel room book­ings re­ceived in­valid tick­ets or book­ing con­fir­ma­tions.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said scammers en­tice buy­ers to con­tact them di­rectly through mes­sag­ing plat­forms such as What­sApp or WeChat by of­fer­ing a bet­ter or faster deal if bank trans­fer pay­ments are made di­rectly to them. Some scammers may also use a lo­cal bank ac­count or pro­vide a copy of an iden­tity card or driver’s li­cence to con­vince buy­ers that they are gen­uine sell­ers.</p>
    <p>“If the price is too good to be true, it prob­a­bly is. Pur­chase only from au­tho­rised sell­ers or rep­utable sources, es­pe­cially for high-value items,” the po­lice ad­vised.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic should opt for buyer pro­tec­tion by us­ing in-built pay­ment op­tions that re­lease pay­ment to the seller only upon de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Those found guilty of cheat­ing can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.</p>
    <p>Those who are con­victed of money laun­der­ing can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $500,000.</p>
    <p>“To avoid be­ing an ac­com­plice to crimes, mem­bers of the pub­lic should al­ways re­ject re­quests by oth­ers to use your bank ac­count or mo­bile lines as you will be held ac­count­able if these ac­counts are linked to il­le­gal trans­ac­tions,” said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>For scam-re­lated ad­vice, the pub­lic can call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688, or visit www.sca­malert.sg</p>
    <p>Those who wish to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion on scams may call the po­lice on 1800-255-0000, or visit www.po­lice.gov.sg/iwit­ness</p>
