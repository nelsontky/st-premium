    <p>Some ob­servers have said that a lead­er­less and di­vided world will be the new nor­mal, es­pe­cially given the United States’ lack of in­ter­est in as­sum­ing global lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>But such lead­er­ship has rarely been pro­vided by any sin­gle power, and to say that the world is en­ter­ing a “new” nor­mal would be to ig­nore his­tor­i­cal facts. This was the key point of con­tention dur­ing a spir­ited de­bate among four geopo­lit­i­cal ob­servers at the Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The an­nual sum­mit gath­ers busi­ness and thought lead­ers to dis­cuss global trends, and ends to­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s vir­tual de­bate mod­er­ated by Fu­tureMap con­sul­tancy founder and man­ag­ing part­ner Parag Khanna saw Mr Ian Brem­mer, pres­i­dent of po­lit­i­cal risk con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group and GZERO Me­dia, cite his rea­sons for think­ing the world has en­tered a lead­er­less new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>First, the US is “much an­grier” now about the idea that it should be the global sher­iff or pro­moter of global val­ues – a na­tional sen­ti­ment that pro­pelled Mr Don­ald Trump to the pres­i­dency in 2016.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, while China is be­com­ing more pow­er­ful, it is still state cap­i­tal­ist and au­thor­i­tar­ian in ori­en­ta­tion, and the in­ter­na­tional ar­chi­tec­ture that it is build­ing stands in com­pe­ti­tion with the US.</p>
    <p>Third, tech­nol­ogy is no longer a uni­fy­ing force. “Ten years ago, as seen in the Arab Spring, there was a lot of sup­port for democ­racy and the use of tech­nol­ogy. To­day, tech­nol­ogy is more about sur­veil­lance and big data that is driv­ing us apart, and we see a tech­nol­ogy Cold War be­tween the US and China,” said Mr Brem­mer. The big­gest prob­lem, he added, is that despite the chal­lenges fac­ing the world, “the Amer­i­cans are not go­ing to be in­ter­ested or feel the im­pulse to fill that vac­uum in the near term”.</p>
    <p>Coun­ter­ing this was Stan­ford Univer­sity se­nior fel­low Niall Fer­gu­son, who said an an­ar­chic world lack­ing order has never ex­isted. “Lead­er­ship is never, if rarely, ever pro­vided by one power. More usu­ally, there are a few great pow­ers that com­pete, some­times cooperatin­g and some­times col­lid­ing.”</p>
    <p>He re­counted the arc of his­tory, from the 1648 Peace of West­phalia – treaties which ended a 30-year Euro­pean war – to the two world wars, where great pow­ers formed coali­tions with lesser pow­ers. Even in the 1990s when the US “was the only show i n town”, he said, China’s rise was al­ready be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Fer­gu­son also cited ex­am­ples where US lead­er­ship has re­mained re­silient, from Amer­ica’s con­tin­ued dom­i­nance of tech firms, and its bro­ker­ing of Is­rael’s land­mark peace deals with the United Arab Emi­rates and Bahrain, to the Fed­eral Re­serve’s ar­ray of ac­tions to limit the eco­nomic dam­age from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Pro­fes­sor Ngaire Woods, dean of Ox­ford Univer­sity’s Blavat­nik School of Gov­ern­ment, pointed out that China does not seem to be try­ing to re­place a US-led sys­tem of gover­nance.</p>
    <p>Rather, she said, it has joined the in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions that the US helped cre­ate, such as the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, and com­peted within these in­sti­tu­tions for in­flu­ence. “There­fore we are get­ting an in­creas­ingly com­plex lead­er­ship, but it is (still) a lead­er­ship. It shows a will­ing­ness by China to – on the US’ own terms – help fashion and push for change in the rules that gov­ern those in­sti­tu­tions.”</p>
    <p>The dean of Ts­inghua Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions, Pro­fes­sor Yan Xue­tong, dis­agreed, say­ing that just be­cause a coun­try has power does not mean that it is pro­vid­ing lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“Lead­er­ship is based on hav­ing fol­low­ers – with­out fol­low­ers, you can­not be a leader,” he said, adding it is doubt­ful if Pres­i­dent Trump could to­day com­mand the same de­gree of sup­port from the global com­mu­nity as Pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush did dur­ing the Iraq War.</p>
    <p>Re­it­er­at­ing Mr Brem­mer’s point about the lack of po­lit­i­cal will­ing­ness, he said that nei­ther the US nor China is will­ing to as­sume lead­er­ship. China’s model of gover­nance – so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics – is premised on lead­er­ship by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, Prof Yan ex­plained. Be­cause it is so spe­cific to China, it can­not pro­vide this lead­er­ship to any other coun­try.</p>
    <p>Nor, he added, is China will­ing to en­ter into ide­o­log­i­cal or eco­nomic con­fronta­tion with the US. “This is some­thing China has fre­quently re­peated. China knows that con­fronta­tion is not in its in­ter­est.”</p>
    <p>Prof Woods cau­tioned against an ex­ces­sively bleak prog­no­sis, point­ing out that nei­ther of them “have the power to sim­ply com­mand a bloc and recre­ate the Cold War”.</p>
    <p>What each is do­ing, she said, is re­bal­anc­ing its re­la­tion­ship with the rest of the world. “I think there are op­por­tu­ni­ties here for coun­tries to start find­ing other av­enues of co­op­er­a­tion that will work well for them, and se­lec­tively co­op­er­ate with one side or the other.”</p>
