    <p>IR­RE­SPON­SI­BLE TAC­TIC</p>
    <p>It is in­ap­pro­pri­ate for any com­pany to play up fears and un­cer­tain­ties to at­tract peo­ple to sign up for its prop­erty in­vest­ment cour­ses. This is an ir­re­spon­si­ble mar­ket­ing tac­tic. Buy­ing of prop­er­ties should not be seen as a quick or easy way to get rich.</p>
    <p>JOINT STATE­MENT BY THE MIN­ISTRY OF NA­TIONAL DEVEL­OP­MENT AND THE MONE­TARY AUTHOR­ITY OF SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties have crit­i­cised the “ir­re­spon­si­ble” ac­tions of some prop­erty in­vest­ment ed­u­ca­tors and real es­tate agents who use scare tac­tics to at­tract cus­tomers to their in­vest­ment cour­ses.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, these peo­ple have been flagged for ac­tively push­ing the mes­sage that “HDB flats will be­come worth­less after 99 years” on so­cial me­dia, so that wor­ried own­ers will pay thou­sands of dol­lars to sign up for their in­vest­ment cour­ses or sell their Hous­ing Board flats to in­vest in pri­vate or com­mer­cial prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in a re­cent mar­ket­ing video that has been up­loaded on YouTube, one such “ed­u­ca­tion com­pany” in­ter­viewed Sin­ga­pore­ans, ask­ing whether they knew that the value of their HDB flats would de­pre­ci­ate over the years .</p>
    <p>In an­other video, after in­ter­view­ing sev­eral work­ers who said they had to work long hours, the pre­sen­ter asked whether Sin­ga­pore­ans re­ally “had to work till they drop” just to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>These ad­ver­tis­ers then ex­hort view­ers to sign up for their “free we­bi­nars”, which pro­mote their prop­erty in­vest­ment strate­gies as the so­lu­tion to view­ers’ woes.</p>
    <p>One such scheme en­tails us­ing shell com­pa­nies to ap­ply for big­ger loans to buy com­mer­cial prop­er­ties – a scheme that is pre­scribed to those who may not be able to in­vest other­wise.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment to The Sun­day Times, spokes­men for the Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment and the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said: “It is in­ap­pro­pri­ate for any com­pany to play up fears and un­cer­tain­ties to at­tract peo­ple to sign up for its prop­erty in­vest­ment cour­ses.</p>
    <p>“This is an ir­re­spon­si­ble mar­ket­ing tac­tic. Buy­ing of prop­er­ties should not be seen as a quick or easy way to get rich.”</p>
    <p>While no reg­u­la­tory ac­tion is be­ing taken now, the MAS has re­minded banks to step up their due dili­gence on com­mer­cial prop­erty loan ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Coun­cil for Es­tate Agen­cies (CEA) has is­sued a warn­ing to real es­tate agents that they must not use “in­ac­cu­rate, false and mis­lead­ing claims” to pres­sure own­ers to sell their HDB flats, just so they can earn more com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>This cau­tion came after a re­cent spike in HDB re­sale trans­ac­tions, which rose by 127.3 per cent in the third quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>The CEA urged the pub­lic to re­port such rogue agents so that it can take ac­tion against those who do not act pro­fes­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties’ re­sponse came about a month after The Sun­day Times’ In­vest flagged the wor­ry­ing trend of some com­pa­nies hold­ing paid cour­ses that pur­port­edly teach peo­ple how to in­vest in prop­er­ties to en­joy good rental in­comes while they wait for “mas­sive cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>These com­pa­nies also claim to have in­vest­ment strate­gies for those who have lit­tle or even no cash. To prove such claims, some past par­tic­i­pants were shown to be able to buy prop­er­ties within days of at­tend­ing such “prop­erty mas­tery” cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Other suc­cess sto­ries touted in­cluded peo­ple who were able to own mul­ti­ple prop­er­ties jointly in a short time.</p>
    <p>The par­tic­i­pants are ap­par­ently taught how to set up pri­vate lim­ited com­pa­nies to buy com­mer­cial prop­er­ties, so that they can get large loans from banks.</p>
    <p>On co-own­er­ship of prop­er­ties, the MAS spokesman said in­vestors need to be aware of the fi­nan­cial risks.</p>
    <p>“Al­though they may only be part-own­ers, if a prop­erty loan is taken out, they can be li­able for the full prop­erty loan amount in the event that other in­vestors de­fault or if there is in­suf­fi­cient rental in­come gen­er­ated to re­pay the prop­erty loan,” the spokesman noted.</p>
    <p>The MAS added that while in­vestors can set up com­pa­nies to buy com­mer­cial prop­er­ties, it re­minded banks to per­form due dili­gence to de­ter­mine if a com­pany is en­gag­ing in sub­stan­tive com­mer­cial ac­tiv­i­ties or is merely a shell en­tity set up for the pur­chase of prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>In the lat­ter case, MAS rules re­quire banks to ap­ply the to­tal debt ser­vic­ing ra­tio rules, which will usu­ally re­sult in lower loan amounts.</p>
    <p>The MAS also re­minded banks to cal­i­brate the loan-to-value lim­its for com­mer­cial prop­erty loans based on prop­erty usage.</p>
    <p>Loan amounts should be lower if the com­mer­cial prop­erty is to be leased out for rental in­come, com­pared with the case where a com­pany buys it for its own use.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies with gen­uine op­er­a­tions nor­mally can get loans of up to 90 per cent of a com­mer­cial prop­erty’s pur­chase price.</p>
    <p>A vet­eran fi­nan­cial ad­viser, who rou­tinely han­dles such deals and de­clined to be named, said most ex­pe­ri­enced prop­erty in­vestors know that banks are usu­ally re­luc­tant to lend more to those who in­tend to buy com­mer­cial prop­er­ties with the sole pur­pose of col­lect­ing rents.</p>
    <p>“As a rule, I al­ways ad­vise them to have cash to pay 30 per cent of the prop­erty price.</p>
    <p>“But after this re­minder from MAS, I would not be sur­prised if banks now ask for more down pay­ment, es­pe­cially if the pur­chase is made through newly set-up com­pa­nies,” he added.</p>
