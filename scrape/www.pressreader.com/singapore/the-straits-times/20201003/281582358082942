    <p>Singaporea­n Amir Khan will be among the fight­ers in ac­tion when live sports makes its re­turn here af­ter months of hi­ber­na­tion, with One Cham­pi­onship’s closed-door Reign of Dy­nas­ties next Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months spent in hi­ber­na­tion due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, live sport will make its re­turn to Sin­ga­pore next Fri­day with One Cham­pi­onship’s Reign of Dy­nas­ties closed-door event.</p>
    <p>The mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) pro­mo­tion last fea­tured at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium on Feb 28, but with­out any fans in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis had forced One to switch from live events – which at­tract be­tween 5,000 and 10,000 spec­ta­tors here and up to 18,000 in other South-east Asian na­tions – and pro­duce closed-door shows and broad­cast them glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Next week’s event is head­lined by Thai Sam-A Gaiyang­hadao, who will de­fend his strawweigh­t Muay Thai world cham­pi­onship against Aus­tralian Josh Tonna.</p>
    <p>There will be five other bouts, in­clud­ing a light­weight clash (up to 77.1kg) be­tween Singaporea­n Amir Khan and Rahul Raju, 29, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent orig­i­nally from In­dia.</p>
    <p>“When you go with­out (a match) for a while, they say you get ‘fight itch’ – I had that,” said Amir, 25.</p>
    <p>“I missed ev­ery­thing that came with a fight – the prepa­ra­tion, in­ter­views, all the ex­cite­ment, ner­vous­ness… so the thrill is back.”</p>
    <p>When you go with­out (a match) for a while, they say you get ‘fight itch’ – I had that. I missed ev­ery­thing that came with a fight, the prepa­ra­tion, in­ter­views, all the ex­cite­ment, ner­vous­ness… so the thrill ’’ is back.</p>
    <p>AMIR KHAN, Sin­ga­pore MMA fighter, on not hav­ing fought since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The Evolve Fight Team fighter feels blessed for the chance to be a part of a “good sign that soon things will be back to nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Premier League foot­ball com­pe­ti­tion has tar­geted a re­sump­tion next Satur­day, with all its play­ers and match of­fi­cials to be swab tested by this week­end.</p>
    <p>As for One, it is un­der­stood ath­letes and of­fi­cials on their card will be quar­an­tined at a ho­tel from Mon­day. While most of the for­eign fight­ers such as Sam-A, De­j­dam­rong Sor Am­nu­aysiri­choke, Eko Sa­pu­tra and Aleksi Toivo­nen in­volved in Fri­day’s event are from the Evolve sta­ble and based in Sin­ga­pore, there are sev­eral oth­ers from Aus­tralia and China.</p>
    <p>One had planned for four closed­door shows in Sin­ga­pore in April and May, but April’s cir­cuit breaker mea­sures scup­pered those plans.</p>
    <p>Fights were even­tu­ally staged in Bangkok on July 31 and Aug 28, but they fea­tured only Thai­land-based ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Both Amir and Raju, who trains with Juggernaut Fight Club and ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in 2010 as a stu­dent at Te­masek Polytech­nic, said they had used the long run-up to their fight to sharpen their skills and fine tune their game plans.</p>
    <p>Amir did shadow box­ing, sprints, and even strik­ing drills with pads taped to a pil­lar at the multi-storey carpark near his home.</p>
    <p>He said he is a “much more im­proved prod­uct” than he was in his last fight in Fe­bru­ary, in which he suf­fered a de­feat by Ja­pan’s Kim­i­hiro Eto. Since Phase Two be­gan in June, Amir has been work­ing with his coach Si­yar Ba­hadurzada to make him as ef­fi­cient a fighter as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“He wanted to make sure I am able to use what I al­ready have – a solid base I don’t al­ways utilise – and take out things that are not al­ways ben­e­fi­cial to me, like un­nec­es­sary move­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>Raju, how­ever, backed him­self to emerge vic­to­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­pect­ing the best Amir Khan on Oct 9, and I’m look­ing for­ward to show­ing that skill-wise, I’m bet­ter than him,” he said.</p>
    <p>Amir, who has lost four of his last five fights, knows the pres­sure is on as he looks to re­dis­cover the form that made him a light­weight ti­tle con­tender, and one of One’s bright­est prospects.</p>
    <p>He said: “Peo­ple know me as the Knock­out King (with seven knock­outs in his first nine fights) and I want to live up to that nick­name, and do that in this fight to give my ca­reer a re­birth.”</p>
