    <p>Ex­perts are op­ti­mistic that Sin­ga­pore can avoid a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 cases as long as peo­ple do not take un­nec­es­sary risks, like gath­er­ing in large groups for par­ties or meals.</p>
    <p>But even if that hap­pens, Sin­ga­pore will likely be able to fig­ure out the source of the resur­gence and im­ple­ment a “sec­to­rial shut­down rather than an­other com­pre­hen­sive lock­down like a cir­cuit breaker”, said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a Covid-19 we­bi­nar hosted by The Straits Times yes­ter­day, he said Sin­ga­pore has a “very good chance” of keep­ing the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases to 10 or 20 a day if ev­ery­one sticks to the rules.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to places with a re­newed surge, he noted that some flare-ups had been linked to in­stances of pro­to­cols be­ing dis­re­garded, like let­ting peo­ple into the coun­try with­out manda­tory quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, I would like to be a lit­tle bit more op­ti­mistic. Presently, our rules are still very well kept to.”</p>
    <p>He added: “If you are on stay­home no­tice, you are re­quired to spend 14 days (at home) af­ter you re­turn from travel over­seas, and peo­ple gen­er­ally fol­low these rules.</p>
    <p>“So­cial dis­tanc­ing, mask wear­ing, I could see when I am out in pub­lic places, most peo­ple fol­low these rules very prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>But should peo­ple dis­re­gard the rules, Sin­ga­pore can learn from coun­tries that have ex­pe­ri­enced a resur­gence, said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing cases in Ja­pan and South Korea linked to nightlife spots like clubs, he said Sin­ga­pore could shut down places or ac­tiv­i­ties that pose a higher risk. As an ex­am­ple, he said the au­thor­i­ties could po­ten­tially or­der cin­e­mas to shut again if clus­ters linked to cin­ema­go­ers emerge.</p>
    <p>An­other panel speaker, Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, said that every mea­sure, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cuit breaker or the de­ci­sion to stop travel, has trade-offs.</p>
    <p>“It helps to con­trol the dis­ease, but at the same time, it costs so­ci­ety. It costs Sin­ga­pore bil­lions (of dol­lars), as we are now learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, the medicine can be more painful than the dis­ease. So, we just have to cal­i­brate that, and I think we can go out now, but just don’t overdo it.”</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant, he added, for peo­ple to ap­pre­ci­ate that the sit­u­a­tion is fluid and changes quickly, re­quir­ing con­trol mea­sures to keep apace.</p>
    <p>He noted that some peo­ple have asked why Sin­ga­pore­ans were told not to wear masks in the early days of the out­break but now, mask wear­ing is manda­tory.</p>
    <p>“But what if there comes a day when we say, okay, we can do with­out masks, and af­ter that, co­in­ci­den­tally, a sec­ond wave hap­pens?</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it is a mat­ter of get­ting it right or wrong. Again, we are try­ing to ad­just to this risk-ben­e­fit.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi added that what works to­day may not work to­mor­row, but this “doesn’t mean that what we are do­ing to­day is wrong”.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said it is not just about the num­bers. He noted that in Melbourne the num­ber of cases de­clined be­cause of lock­downs, but soon af­ter they were lifted, many nurs­ing homes, meat­pack­ing plants and other places re­ported new cases.</p>
    <p>What is more im­por­tant is a strong pub­lic health re­sponse and good com­mu­nity be­hav­iour, and Sin­ga­pore can tick these boxes, he said.</p>
    <p>“It is very im­por­tant to keep peo­ple on track. When you start chang­ing the com­mu­nity be­hav­iour by loos­en­ing re­stric­tions, that is when you take the risk,” he said.</p>
