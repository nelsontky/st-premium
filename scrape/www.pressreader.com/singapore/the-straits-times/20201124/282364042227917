    <p>MI­AMI South Korean Kim Seiy­oung fol­lowed up her first Ma­jor ti­tle at the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship with her 12th LPGA crown on Sun­day, fir­ing an even-par 70 to win the Pel­i­can Women’s Cham­pi­onship by three strokes.</p>
    <p>“A win is al­ways great,” said the world No. 2, who be­came the first wo­man since Thai Ariya Ju­tanu­garn in 2016 to fol­low a maiden Ma­jor ti­tle with a Tour tri­umph in her next start. “I’m very happy to win the 12th tour­na­ment, and af­ter win­ning the Ma­jor tour­na­ment, it means a lot to me.”</p>
    <p>She fin­ished with a 14-un­der to­tal of 266 for a three-shot win over Ally McDon­ald, who carded a twounder 68 in Bel­leair, Florida.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old Amer­i­can had trailed Kim by five com­ing into the fi­nal round, and ad­mit­ted that while she started the day aim­ing to close the gap, “once we got to a point, I j ust tried to take Seiy­oung out of it and play like a lit­tle tour­na­ment within the rest of the field”.</p>
    <p>McDon­ald, who claimed her first LPGA ti­tle at the Drive On Cham­pi­onship i n Ge­or­gia last month, fin­ished two strokes in front of North­ern Ire­land’s Stephanie Meadow, who fired a 69 for 271.</p>
    <p>But Kim said she felt some pres­sure as her lead dwin­dled to three strokes mid-round.</p>
    <p>“I was, like, ‘OK, Sei-young, fo­cus. Keep go­ing’,” she said, adding that the lack of wind af­ter three gusty days made for a tough ad­just­ment. “Very chal­leng­ing golf to­day.”</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old­said her as­sur­ance de­serted her af­ter a bo­gey at the par-three ninth, where her sec­ond shot flew the green and she chipped on and two-putted.</p>
    <p>That erased the gain she had made with a birdie at the par-four sixth hole.</p>
    <p>“When I turned the ninth hole, I was (feel­ing) a lit­tle bit of pres­sure be­fore I made the birdie at 14,” Kim said, and af­ter that “ev­ery­thing was good”.</p>
    <p>Kim has now passed Shin Ji-yai on the LPGA’s all-time win list for South Korean golfers and now trails only Pak Se-ri (25) and Park In-bee (20).</p>
    <p>Two wins in her last two starts have her feel­ing con­fi­dent with the fi­nal Ma­jor of the pan­demicdis­rupted sea­son – the Women’s US Open – com­ing up next month in Hous­ton, fol­lowed by the Tour Cham­pi­onship in Naples, Florida.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter a win I’ve al­ways got the ex­tra con­fi­dence,” she said. “I feel happy when I walk on the course.”</p>
