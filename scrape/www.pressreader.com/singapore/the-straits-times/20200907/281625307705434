    <p>DBS has been named best bank in the world by fi­nan­cial pub­li­ca­tion Global Fi­nance, mark­ing the third con­sec­u­tive year in which it has been recog­nised through var­i­ous awards as a top global bank.</p>
    <p>The New York-based mag­a­zine’s pub­lisher and ed­i­to­rial di­rec­tor Joseph Giar­ra­puto said DBS Bank is ex­em­plary of a bank that was ready for the sharp rise in de­mand for dig­i­tal bank­ing ser­vices dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said: “Over the past decade, it in­vested heav­ily in all things dig­i­tal and cre­ated a cul­ture for bank­ing that is in­clu­sive and ef­fi­cient. Those in­vest­ments are pay­ing off at a time of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty. They have strength­ened the bank’s re­silience and helped it to serve its cus­tomers in their time of need.”</p>
    <p>Past win­ners of the best bank in the world award in­clude Bank of Amer­ica and ING Bank.</p>
    <p>DBS’ lat­est award fol­lows sim­i­lar hon­ours last year and in 2018. Fi­nance mag­a­zine Euromoney named it world’s best bank last year, in a first for an Asian bank.</p>
    <p>In 2018, it was named best bank in the world by Global Fi­nance. It picked up an­other award in the same year, when Fi­nan­cial Times pub­li­ca­tion The Banker named it global bank of the year.</p>
    <p>DBS chief ex­ec­u­tive Piyush Gupta said the bank is hon­oured to put Sin­ga­pore on the world map again. He also ac­knowl­edged the vi­tal role that banks play in sup­port­ing em­ploy­ees, cus­tomers and the wider com­mu­nity amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We are hum­bled by the ac­knowl­edge­ment of our ef­forts on this front, par­tic­u­larly how our in­vest­ments in dig­i­tal and our cul­ture of in­clu­siv­ity have en­abled us to serve cus­tomers in their time of need,” he said.</p>
    <p>In March, the bank launched a dig­i­tal relief pack­age to help food and bev­er­age busi­nesses set up an on­line food or­der­ing site in just three busi­ness days.</p>
    <p>Sup­ported by the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, DBS worked with two lo­cal tech start-ups, Od­dle and FirstCom, to help its food and bev­er­age clients es­tab­lish an on­line pres­ence through mea­sures such as an e-menu, dig­i­tal shopfront and so­cial me­dia pres­ence.</p>
    <p>Among the bank’s other ini­tia­tives, its sub­sidiary POSB opened about 41,000 bank ac­counts for mi­grant work­ers in April, more than three times its usual monthly signups of 11,000 to 13,000.</p>
    <p>This al­lowed work­ers to ac­cess dig­i­tal bank­ing ser­vices via the POSB Jolly app, es­pe­cially when they were quar­an­tined in dor­mi­to­ries be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>DBS was this year named Sin­ga­pore’s most valu­able brand for the eighth con­sec­u­tive year by brand strat­egy and val­u­a­tion con­sul­tancy Brand Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>It placed first in the con­sul­tancy’s 2020 top 100 Sin­ga­pore brands rank­ing, with a brand value of US$8.47 bil­lion (S$11.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>At the re­lease of its sec­ond-quar­ter fi­nan­cial re­sults last month, Mr Gupta said DBS has been in­creas­ing its dig­i­tal transactio­ns and mar­ket share over the past few months.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s largest bank re­ported a 22 per cent fall in net profit to $1.2 bil­lion as it set aside more money for loan pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>This was down from $1.6 bil­lion a year ago, nar­rowly beat­ing the $1.19 bil­lion av­er­age es­ti­mate of eight an­a­lysts sur­veyed by Bloomberg.</p>
