    <p>MASAYA (Nicaragua) • A rare white tiger named Nieve, or snow in Span­ish, was born at the Nicaragua zoo, and is be­ing raised by hu­mans af­ter be­ing re­jected by her mother, the direc­tor of the zoo has said.</p>
    <p>Nieve came into the world a week ago, weigh­ing just un­der 1kg at birth, zoo direc­tor Ed­uardo Sa­casa told AFP.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tion group World Wide Fund for Nature de­scribes white tigers as “a ge­netic anom­aly”, with none known to ex­ist in the wild. There are sev­eral dozen in cap­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>White tigers are Ben­gal tigers whose par­ents carry a re­ces­sive gene, ac­cord­ing to The Wild­cat Sanc­tu­ary in Min­nesota which helps and stud­ies fe­lines. They are not al­bi­nos or a sep­a­rate species.</p>
    <p>Some parks and zoos in­breed white tigers, as white cubs draw more vis­i­tors, though this is of­ten at the cost of mal­for­ma­tions and other ge­netic prob­lems, ac­cord</p>
    <p>ing to the sanc­tu­ary’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The Nicaragua zoo said Nieve was the first white tiger born in the coun­try, to a pair of yel­lowand black-coloured Ben­gals.</p>
    <p>The cub’s mother, res­cued af­ter she was aban­doned by a cir­cus, had in­her­ited the rare gene from</p>
    <p>her grand­fa­ther, which was white.</p>
    <p>Nieve was taken away from her mother, which re­jected her, and is be­ing bot­tle-fed by Dr Sa­casa’s wife Ma­rina Ar­guello, who helps man­age the zoo of some 700 an­i­mals and a res­cue cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Ms Ar­guello whis­pered sweet</p>
    <p>noth­ings into the tiny cub’s ear while she suck­led, and pat her lightly on the back af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>“She has not lost her ap­petite; ev­ery three hours she gets the bot­tle. If not, she screams... also if the milk gets too cold,” said Ms Ar­guello.</p>
