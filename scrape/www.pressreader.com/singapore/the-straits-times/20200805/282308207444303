    <p>LON­DON • Over the past few days, mul­ti­ple Bri­tish me­dia re­ports have said Borus­sia Dort­mund and Manch­ester United are locked in ne­go­ti­a­tions over the sale of Jadon San­cho for a fee over £100 mil­lion (S$179 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the BBC, the Red Devils have un­til Mon­day to match the Bun­desliga club’s valu­a­tion of the Eng­land for­ward, one of the most cov­eted names this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>While the Ger­man trans­fer win­dow only closes on Oct 5, Dort­mund want a swift res­o­lu­tion as they do not want spec­u­la­tion to af­fect prepa­ra­tions for next sea­son. which starts on Sept 18.</p>
    <p>But when asked at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s Europa League last-16, sec­ond-leg tie with Aus­trian side Lask whether United were close to agree­ing terms for San­cho, Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer kept his cards close to chest.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian, whose side lead 5-0 from the first leg, said: “This trans­fer win­dow is a long one. Every trans­fer takes its course.”</p>
    <p>While he played it coy, it ap­pears the big-money move is inch­ing to­wards com­ple­tion, with Ger­man daily Bild yes­ter­day re­port­ing San­cho had agreed a five-year con­tract worth £340,000-a-week, with the price even­tu­ally ris­ing to £108 mil­lion. Should that be the fi­nal fee – Dort­mund and United are dis­cussing the struc­ture of the deal – the 20-year-old will be­come the most ex­pen­sive player signed by an English club, top­ping the £89 mil­lion that United paid Ju­ven­tus for Paul Pogba in 2016.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer was, how­ever, more ea­ger to di­vert the talk away from San­cho’s fu­ture to United’s am­bi­tions in the Europa League.</p>
    <p>With the do­mes­tic term fin­ished and a Cham­pi­ons League place se­cured, the Europa League re­mains his side’s only op­por­tu­nity for sil­ver­ware. And de­spite their lead, he said he would not field a sec­ond­string side at Old Traf­ford.</p>
    <p>“We’re four games away from win­ning a tro­phy,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The team has de­vel­oped all through the sea­son, we’re de­lighted with fin­ish­ing third (in the league), but the next step is win­ning a tro­phy. The play­ers want to play, they don’t want a break.”</p>
    <p>To high­light how se­ri­ously United are tak­ing the Europa League, Sol­sk­jaer said the team will be based in Ger­many, where the quar­ter-fi­nal ties and be­yond will be played. This edi­tion of the Europa League has been re­for­mat­ted to a knock­out com­pe­ti­tion as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
