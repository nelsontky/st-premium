    <p>Faced with aches and pains from poor pos­ture and spend­ing long hours in front of their desks, peo­ple work­ing from home snapped up gam­ing chairs and other er­gonomic fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>In July, re­tail­ers here re­ported marked in­creases in sales of of­fice chairs.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics chain Gain City, which also stocks er­gonomic chairs, re­ported a year-on-year in­crease of “more than 31/ times” since the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Scan­di­na­vian fur­ni­ture re­tailer Dan­ish De­sign Co, which stocks er­gonomic de­signer pieces from Den­mark, Nor­way and Swe­den for the home and of­fice, saw a 30 to 40 per cent spike in sales.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on de­sign or fea­tures, prices of pos­ture­friendly chairs range from about $80 to more than $2,000.</p>
    <p>Gam­ing chairs were also pop­u­lar as peo­ple stayed home more this year, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Home-grown gam­ing chair man­u­fac­turer Se­cret­lab, re­ported in July that it had to ramp up pro­duc­tion just to keep pace with de­mand.</p>
    <p>To­day, it has sold more than a mil­lion er­gonomic gam­ing seats to cus­tomers from more than 60 coun­tries since the com­pany was founded in 2014.</p>
    <p>Its gam­ing chairs, which cost from $500 for faux leather ver­sions to more than $1,000 for pre­mium napa leather de­signs, are said to soothe fraz­zled nerves and last up to five years.</p>
    <p>It is de­signed with lum­bar sup­port and can re­cline up to 165 de­grees.</p>
    <p>An­other lo­cal er­gonomic fur­ni­ture maker known for its “pan­demic chairs” is Er­goEdge.</p>
    <p>Its lat­est Er­goTune gam­ing chair ($399 to $599) was re­leased in Septem­ber and fea­tures a new Gy­roBrace 5D arm­rest, which works on the prin­ci­ple that com­fort can be achieved only when a seat is tai­lored to a per­son’s unique body shape.</p>
    <p>This en­tails the chair be­ing fully ad­justable across 11 points – from the head­rest to the de­gree of the re­cliner mech­a­nism.</p>
    <p>The new­est en­trant in the gam­ing chair mar­ket is Osim In­ter­na­tional, which has launched its first gam­ing mas­sage chair, the uThrone.</p>
    <p>The home-grown brand, known for its mas­sage lounge chairs and mas­sage gad­gets, claims its V-Hand mas­sage tech­nol­ogy i n the seat mim­ics the mas­sage tech­niques of a pro­fes­sional masseur, re­lax­ing deep-seated knots in the neck and shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>The uThrone is avail­able for pre­order at $899.</p>
