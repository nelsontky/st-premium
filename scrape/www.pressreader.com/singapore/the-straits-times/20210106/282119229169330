    <p>A youth who left a po­lice­man with a spinal cord injury and su­per­fi­cial bite wounds was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to two years’ pro­ba­tion.</p>
    <p>As part of his pro­ba­tion, the 17-year-old drug of­fender has to re­main in­doors from 10pm to 6am ev­ery day and per­form 80 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>He also has to un­dergo reg­u­lar urine tests.</p>
    <p>He can­not be named as those un­der 18 are cov­ered un­der the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act.</p>
    <p>The of­fender pleaded guilty in a district court on Nov 19 last year to one count each of caus­ing grievous hurt to a pub­lic ser­vant and metham­phetamine con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim – a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man – and his col­league were con­duct­ing foot pa­trol at Block 90 Red­hill Close at around 2pm on Aug 5 last year when they en­tered a lift on the sev­enth storey and saw the of­fender and his cousin in­side.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Tan Hsiao Tien dis­closed in ear­lier pro­ceed­ings that the of­fi­cers de­cided to search the duo upon notic­ing that they ap­peared ner­vous and had blood­shot eyes. A small brown box that the cousin was hold­ing was found to con­tain drug-tak­ing uten­sils.</p>
    <p>When t hey ar­rived at t he ground floor of the block, the vic­tim’s col­league searched the of­fender’s cousin. It was at this point that the of­fender put up a vi­o­lent struggle.</p>
    <p>DPP Tan told the court: “The vic­tim... man­aged to grab the ac­cused from the back and pin him down on the floor. A struggle en­sued... The vic­tim in­structed the ac­cused to stop strug­gling, but he did not com­ply and again at­tempted to run away.</p>
    <p>“The vic­tim man­aged to pull the ac­cused back down. Dur­ing the struggle, the ac­cused man­aged (to slip one hand out of the hand­cuff). The ac­cused also bit the vic­tim on his left arm and left chest in an at­tempt to es­cape cus­tody.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice backup ar­rived soon af­ter and the at­tacker was ar­rested.</p>
    <p>The of­fender was re­ferred to the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau and his urine sam­ples were found to con­tain traces of metham­phetamine, com­monly known as Ice. In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that he had con­sumed the drug on Aug 4 last year.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent left the vic­tim with numb­ness on the left side of his body. His left arm and leg had also weak­ened.</p>
    <p>He was given 30 days of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion leave and has since fully re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>De­tails about the of­fender’s cousin and the out­come of his case were not dis­closed in court doc­u­ments.</p>
