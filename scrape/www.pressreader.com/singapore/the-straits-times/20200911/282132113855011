    <p>Catal­ist-listed Ax­ing­ton said on Wed­nes­day night that it will al­low share­hold­ers who have ap­plied for, ac­cepted and/or paid for its rights shares or ex­cess rights shares to with­draw their ac­cep­tance if they wished to do so.</p>
    <p>This is in view of the vol­un­tary sus­pen­sion of Ax­ing­ton shares since Aug 31, pend­ing the re­lease of an an­nounce­ment re­lated to strate­gic changes to the com­pany’s busi­ness di­rec­tion, the com­pany said in a fil­ing to the Singapore Ex­change.</p>
    <p>Ac­cep­tances, ap­pli­ca­tions and/or pay­ment made by en­ti­tled share­hold­ers for the rights shares or ex­cess rights shares dur­ing and prior to the sus­pen­sion can be with­drawn.</p>
    <p>To do so, share­hold­ers must pro­vide writ­ten in­struc­tions with their au­tho­rised sig­na­to­ries to the Cen­tral De­pos­i­tory and/or the Share Reg­is­trar on be­half of the com­pany, dur­ing the pe­riod up to the new clos­ing date for the rights is­sue.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton ad­vised share­hold­ers to look out for an an­nounce­ment that it will make on the re­vised ex­pected timetable for key events of its rights is­sue.</p>
    <p>The two-mem­ber board of Ax­ing­ton an­nounced on Sun­day that it will ex­tend the rights of­fer pe­riod, with­out giv­ing a new dead­line, as it awaited “fur­ther clar­ity” from the com­pany’s con­trol­ling share­hold­ers, cousins Nelson Loh and Ter­ence Loh.</p>
    <p>The Lohs and busi­ness part­ner Evan­ge­line Shen are co-founders of Singapore-reg­is­tered Bel­la­graph</p>
    <p>Nova (BN) Group, which grabbed head­lines last month by an­nounc­ing a bid for English Pre­mier League foot­ball club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>But the BN Group quickly be­came mired in con­tro­versy due to rev­e­la­tions rang­ing from doc­tored Obama im­ages to in­con­sis­ten­cies in claims and re­tracted press state­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen re­signed last week as Ax­ing­ton’s chair­man, along with three other di­rec­tors, a week af­ter for­mer US am­bas­sador to Singapore Kirk Wa­gar quit the board.</p>
    <p>The firm ear­lier scrapped an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing that was to have been held on Aug 27 to, among oth­ers, ap­prove a name change from Ax­ing­ton to NETX and a change in its core busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton, in Wed­nes­day’s fil­ing, also in­formed share­hold­ers that the PayNow QR code on the ap­pli­ca­tion and ac­cep­tance forms dis­patched on or around Aug 26 would be­come in­ef­fec­tive af­ter 9.30pm on Wed­nes­day. This was the orig­i­nal dead­line for ac­cep­tance and pay­ment for the rights shares and ex­cess rights shares.</p>
    <p>It will gen­er­ate a new PayNow QR code when the new clos­ing date is fixed.</p>
