    <p>For nearly eight months now, bou­tique ho­tels Ann Siang House, Kesa House and Wan­der­lust have re­mained closed.</p>
    <p>Open­ing the ho­tels, which are man­aged by prop­erty in­vest­ment com­pany 8M Real Es­tate, would not make fi­nan­cial sense as there are still no tourists and lo­cal de­mand would not be able to make up for the costs in­volved in run­ning the ho­tels, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Sara Vil­lar­real told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>She said the com­pany first made the de­ci­sion to close the ho­tels tem­po­rar­ily when Sin­ga­pore en­tered the cir­cuit breaker in April.</p>
    <p>“Over time, as it be­came clearer that this cri­sis was go­ing to be pro­tracted and there was no real vis­i­bil­ity in terms of when we would see re­cov­ery, we made the de­ci­sion that we would keep the ho­tels closed,” said Ms Vil­lar­real.</p>
    <p>Many travel agen­cies have taken the same ap­proach by go­ing into hi­ber­na­tion, said Mr Steven Ler, pres­i­dent of the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Travel Agents Sin­ga­pore (Natas).</p>
    <p>He added that Natas has seen only about “one or two” of its roughly 400 mem­bers per­ma­nently clos­ing so far, as many are still hope­ful of busi­ness re­turn­ing once air travel re­sumes.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral said they adapted by fo­cus­ing more on lo­cal tourism.</p>
    <p>So far, 152 tour op­er­a­tors and 44 tour guides have been al­lowed to re­sume tour op­er­a­tions here, out of the more than 1,000 ac­tive tour op­er­a­tors in to­tal, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s (STB) web­site.</p>
    <p>Tourism is one of the hard­est-hit sec­tors from the fall­out of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with air­planes grounded as global travel came to a halt.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port, which was once one of the world’s busiest, saw only about 5,600 com­mer­cial flights be­tween April and Septem­ber – a 97 per cent drop in vol­ume com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Air pas­sen­ger ar­rivals in Sin­ga­pore have also fallen by 99 per cent – from the roughly 17 mil­lion ar­rivals be­tween April and Septem­ber last year to about 126,000 in the same pe­riod this year.</p>
    <p>Of these vis­i­tors, the ma­jor­ity were from China, fol­lowed by In­done­sia and Malaysia, ac­cord­ing to data from STB.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, ho­tels in Sin­ga­pore had an av­er­age oc­cu­pancy rate of 80 to 90 per cent. In April, this fell to about 38 per cent, STB data showed.</p>
    <p>There were 424 ho­tels here last year, with a to­tal of roughly 69,000 rooms.</p>
    <p>While some busi­ness own­ers have shut their doors tem­po­rar­ily, oth­ers are tap­ping the lo­cal mar­ket to tide over the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Eco-tour agency Kayaka­sia used to run fre­quent over­seas kayak­ing trips, with about 20 per cent of its busi­ness de­pen­dent on lo­cal tours or­gan­ised on oc­ca­sional week­ends, said founder Sim Cher Huey.</p>
    <p>Now, it or­gan­ises lo­cal kayak­ing tours, in­clud­ing those to Pu­lau Ubin and Sen­tosa, “nearly ev­ery other day” to keep the busi­ness afloat, said Mr Sim, who runs the busi­ness with one staff.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel Soloha, a 45-room bou­tique ho­tel in Chi­na­town that opened in De­cem­ber last year, is keep­ing its rooms open for book­ings, with a stan­dard room go­ing from $108 be­fore taxes.</p>
    <p>“With the Sin­ga­porean crowd, we saw pent-up de­mand when the cir­cuit breaker ended in June, with oc­cu­pancy rate at about 50 per cent due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. Now, we are still in this range, but I don’t think it will be able to hit pre-Covid lev­els any time soon,” said founder of Ho­tel Soloha, Mr Josh Hu.</p>
    <p>A con­so­la­tion for these touris­mde­pen­dent com­pa­nies, how­ever, came from gov­ern­ment sup­port, such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, they told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The scheme pro­vides 75 per cent in wage sub­si­dies for Sin­ga­porean or per­ma­nent res­i­dent em­ploy­ees hired by com­pa­nies in tourism.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally slated to cover 10 months of wages un­til Au­gust, the scheme was ex­tended to cover 50 per cent of wages paid up to next March for the tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>New laws passed last week, to al­low small busi­nesses to ter­mi­nate their con­tracts early if they are un­able to rene­go­ti­ate new terms with counter-par­ties, will also come in handy for many tour agen­cies, said Natas’ Mr Ler.</p>
    <p>“It will def­i­nitely serve as an ad­di­tional op­tion for agents to con­sider if it will fur­ther re­duce their over­head costs,” he added.</p>
    <p>While they wait out the down­turn, some busi­nesses are pre­par­ing for the even­tual re­turn of tourists.</p>
    <p>At 8M Real Es­tate’s three ho­tels that are tem­po­rar­ily closed, staff have been go­ing for skills up­grad­ing cour­ses, while the com­pany is mak­ing use of the down­time to carry out ren­o­va­tions.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to stay closed for­ever, and ob­vi­ously as the owner of the prop­erty, it’s not in our in­ter­est to have them not gen­er­at­ing rev­enue,” Ms Vil­lar­real said, adding that the pub­lic can ex­pect the ho­tels to re­open “in the near fu­ture”.</p>
