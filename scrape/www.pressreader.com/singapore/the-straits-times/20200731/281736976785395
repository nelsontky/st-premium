    <p>The govern­ment has backpedall­ed on its de­ci­sion to fully ban din­ing in at eater­ies one day into the new rule kick­ing in, after draw­ing crit­i­cisms for the move, while the city hits a high in new daily coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment is­sued yes­ter­day, the govern­ment said that after ob­serv­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the dine-in ban, it un­der­stood the mea­sure “has in­con­ve­nienced and made it dif­fi­cult for em­ploy­ees”.</p>
    <p>From to­day, peo­ple may dine in at eater­ies for break­fast and lunch, but only take­aways are al­lowed for din­ner.</p>
    <p>Eater­ies will run at half ca­pac­ity, with each ta­ble capped at two din­ers, while the 1.5m rule be­tween ta­bles still ap­plies.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came after blue-col­lar work­ers, in­clud­ing con­struc­tion work­ers and clean­ers, were seen hav­ing take­aways out­doors in heavy rain, or in­side toi­lets or store­rooms.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the govern­ment said it would open 19 com­mu­nity halls across the city be­tween 11am and 3pm from yes­ter­day for those with­out a place to lunch, but some said these halls may have been too far for them.</p>
    <p>The backpedall­ing comes as the govern­ment strug­gles to con­tain the com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions as the num­ber of new surges daily.</p>
    <p>For the ninth day in a row, Hong Kong added more than 100 new in­fec­tions</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties said at the daily brief­ing that there were 149 new cases yes­ter­day – the high­est in a sin­gle day – bring­ing the con­firmed tally to 3,151, in­clud­ing 25 deaths.</p>
    <p>Of the new in­fec­tions, 145 were lo­cal cases, of which sources were un­known for 61 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>China’s di­rec­tor of the State Key Lab­o­ra­tory of Re­s­pi­ra­tory Dis­ease Zhong Nan­shan sug­gested in a Xinhua in­ter­view that the Hong Kong govern­ment should pro­vide ter­ri­tory-wide free nu­cleic acid screen­ings, with help from the main­land.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment must take firm ac­tion against peo­ple who “de­lib­er­ately come out to make trou­ble” or “hold gath­er­ings or demon­stra­tions” dur­ing this cru­cial pe­riod, he said.</p>
    <p>But Pro­fes­sor David Hui, a re­s­pi­ra­tory dis­ease ex­pert from the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong, told a lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion yes­ter­day that it is not prac­ti­cal to test every­one in the city. A per­son can test neg­a­tive one day but pos­i­tive in the days that fol­low.</p>
    <p>Prof Hui said his peers have con­ducted an anal­y­sis with the re­sults sug­gest­ing that the third wave of the out­break could be over by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>Over the past five weeks, com­mu­nity out­breaks have been grow­ing faster than health­care ser­vices can cope with, as test­ing ser­vices are stretched to their lim­its and hos­pi­tal beds for Covid-19 pa­tients run out.</p>
    <p>On Wednes­day, Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam warned that Hong Kong was “on the verge of a largescale com­mu­nity out­break, which may lead to a col­lapse of our hos­pi­tal sys­tem and cost lives, es­pe­cially of the el­derly”.</p>
    <p>To free up more beds for Covid-19 pa­tients in se­ri­ous con­di­tions, the Hos­pi­tal Author­ity yes­ter­day said there will be 500 beds and three doc­tors sta­tioned at the new Covid-19 treat­ment fa­cil­ity at Asi­aWorld-Expo con­ven­tion cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously used as a coro­n­avirus test­ing cen­tre for in­com­ing trav­ellers, the cen­tre will be­gin run­ning in a few days’ time and cater to pa­tients in sta­ble con­di­tions who are aged be­tween 18 and 60.</p>
    <p>As pres­sure mounts on the govern­ment to con­tain the com­mu­nity spread, it rolled out tighter re­stric­tions on Wednes­day that halved the num­ber at pub­lic gath­er­ings to two and or­dered peo­ple to wear masks at all times at out­door pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple venues, the list of which keeps ex­pand­ing from gyms, cin­e­mas, mas­sage par­lours to sports cen­tres and swim­ming pools, have been or­dered to shut since July 15 and will re­main so un­til next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the govern­ment also said civil ser­vants, save for those pro­vid­ing emer­gency ser­vices and es­sen­tial pub­lic ser­vices, will con­tinue to work from home un­til Aug 9.</p>
