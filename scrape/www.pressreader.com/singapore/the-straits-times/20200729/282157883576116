    <p>Help­ing busi­nesses stay afloat by cut­ting red tape and reg­u­la­tory bar­ri­ers is even more ur­gent now thanks to the pan­demic, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs and Trans­port Chee Hong Tat.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee told an on­line dis­cus­sion: “Even be­fore Covid-19, the need to trans­form our econ­omy to look for new ways of help­ing busi­nesses re­duce reg­u­la­tory bar­ri­ers, lower our reg­u­la­tory costs, and to sup­port new busi­ness mod­els and new ways of do­ing things (was) rel­e­vant and valid.</p>
    <p>“But with Covid-19, the im­pe­tus to do that has be­come even more sig­nif­i­cant and even more ur­gent, be­cause we are now at a stage where we have to trans­form and we have to change in or­der to sur­vive the cri­sis and to emerge stronger sub­se­quently.”</p>
    <p>He added that ac­tions taken be­fore the pan­demic have also ended up be­ing ben­e­fi­cial to firms, such as the shift from hard copy forms to dig­i­tal fil­ing and al­low­ing com­pa­nies to of­fer services on­line.</p>
    <p>“Look for dif­fer­ent in­no­va­tive ways of reg­u­lat­ing that can be more ef­fec­tive (in) achiev­ing the same out­comes of safety and con­sumer pro­tec­tion while al­low­ing busi­nesses to have lower reg­u­la­tory bar­ri­ers and... li­cens­ing costs.”</p>
    <p>By re­mov­ing re­dun­dant steps and over­lap­ping li­cences and mak­ing good use of tech­nol­ogy, cost sav­ings can be passed down to firms and con­sumers, he noted.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment also has to take risks in tweak­ing rules to sup­port new busi­ness ideas, even if com­pa­nies do not have a track record yet, said Mr Chee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at a di­a­logue with busi­nesses and mem­bers of the Pro-En­ter­prise Panel, a private-public plat­form un­der the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try that com­prises busi­ness lead­ers and se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials work­ing to­wards re­duc­ing the reg­u­la­tory bur­den on com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“If we are re­fus­ing to take that step for­ward and want­ing to play 100 per cent safe, and not ven­ture out of our com­fort zone, then ac­tu­ally there’s no way to do this.”</p>
    <p>He also noted that the Gov­ern­ment has to be com­fort­able deal­ing with un­cer­tainty, since the pace of change in the world has picked up.</p>
    <p>“This is where I think we need to ac­cel­er­ate the re­views and find ways in which we can get feed­back more quickly and be pre­pared to make some ad­just­ments, in­clud­ing in ar­eas where we have not tried, (such as) new busi­ness ideas, new sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>Ms Low Yen Ling, the re­cently ap­pointed Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try, and Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, told the event that agen­cies also have to take a more en­ter­prise-cen­tric ap­proach to see how rules can be in­ter­preted and then ad­hered to by com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“We also need to see how we can innovate our agen­cies... so that we can bet­ter sup­port new busi­ness mod­els and also new tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>The panel is part­ner­ing the Fair Ten­ancy Frame­work In­dus­try Com­mit­tee, which was formed in April to ad­dress is­sues between land­lords and tenants, es­pe­cially dur­ing this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee is made up of rep­re­sen­ta­tives from or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion Com­mit­tee, As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises and the Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The panel and com­mit­tee will set up clin­ics for tenants to clar­ify their con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Look for dif­fer­ent in­no­va­tive ways of reg­u­lat­ing that can be more ef­fec­tive (in) achiev­ing the same out­comes of safety and con­sumer pro­tec­tion while al­low­ing busi­nesses to have lower reg­u­la­tory bar­ri­ers and ... li­cens­ing ’’ costs.</p>
