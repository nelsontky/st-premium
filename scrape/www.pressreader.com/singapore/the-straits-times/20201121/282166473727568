    <p>In Sin­ga­pore and around the world, the road to re­cov­ery is paved with good in­ten­tions. Na­tions are seek­ing a re­cov­ery from the eco­nomic fall­out from Covid-19 by fo­cus­ing on low-car­bon sec­tors. The Straits Times high­lights some ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>Tham Kwang Sheun works in the au­to­mo­tive in­dus­try, but is quite un­likely to see, let alone pick up, a pis­ton, spark plug or ex­haust man­i­fold.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham, 45, is chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer of home-grown elec­tric mo­tor­cy­cle maker Scorpio Elec­tric.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this, he held var­i­ous po­si­tions in sim­i­lar fields, in­clud­ing head of the Au­ton­o­mous Ve­hi­cle</p>
    <p>Pro­gramme Of­fice at the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity and prin­ci­pal an­a­lyst at the En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>“This is very dif­fer­ent from my pre­vi­ous jobs, even if they share some sim­i­lar dis­ci­plines,” he said.</p>
    <p>Part of his work in­volves us­ing big data to op­ti­mise the per­for­mance and ef­fi­ciency of Scorpio’s up­com­ing bat­tery-pow­ered twowheeler, which is cur­rently in the pro­to­type stage.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham points out that the “new­ness” of his job stems largely from the fact that Sin­ga­pore does not have much of an au­to­mo­tive in­dus­try, and that un­like other soft­waredriven elec­tronic prod­ucts, an elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) has to have longevity and ro­bust­ness.</p>
    <p>“It’s chal­leng­ing but re­ward­ing,” he said of his new role.</p>
    <p>“You feel a sense of achieve­ment be­ing in a Sin­ga­pore au­to­mo­tive com­pany which is start­ing every­thing from scratch.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tham’s role is among scores emerg­ing from the new econ­omy.</p>
    <p>At the ground-break­ing cer­e­mony to mark Hyundai Mo­tor’s mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar “smart fac­tory” in Jurong last month, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong listed In­dus­trial In­ter­net of Things en­gi­neers, data sci­en­tists, cobot (col­lab­o­ra­tive ro­bot) tech­ni­cians and dig­i­tal sup­ply chain strate­gists as some of the new po­si­tions await­ing fu­ture job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>“These job ti­tles did not even ex­ist a few years ago,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>“But these jobs are now on the cut­ting edge.”</p>
    <p>To be sure, the new econ­omy still needs tra­di­tional dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>Scorpio Elec­tric chief ex­ec­u­tive Melvin Goh said the com­pany’s as­sem­bly fa­cil­ity in Te­ban Gar­dens Cres­cent – which will make up to 6,000 e-bikes a year – has 20 staff.</p>
    <p>“This will go up to 30 in the next 12 months,” Mr Goh said, adding that hires will in­clude soft­ware, me­chan­i­cal and elec­tri­cal en­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>At Ion Mo­bil­ity, a younger lo­cal elec­tric mo­tor­bike ven­ture, which re­cently se­cured US$3 mil­lion (S$4 mil­lion) in seed fund­ing, the firm’s head­count has tre­bled from five to 15 in the last six months.</p>
    <p>Au­to­mo­tive en­gi­neers and de­sign­ers, bat­tery spe­cial­ists, au­to­mo­tive elec­tron­ics en­gi­neers and soft­ware de­vel­op­ers are among staff Ion has and will be hir­ing.</p>
    <p>Ion co-founder Joel Chang said: “We see the fu­ture of EV jobs here. Man­u­fac­tur­ing an EV is easy enough, but we want to have the ca­pa­bil­ity of mak­ing our own bat­tery packs in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only a hand­ful of ma­jor EV man­u­fac­tur­ers make their own bat­ter­ies. Mr Chang added: “Bat­tery pro­duc­tion needs to be close to the man­u­fac­ture of ve­hi­cles to min­imise lo­gis­tics costs.”</p>
    <p>So­lar group Sun­seap’s arm Charge+, which builds EV charg</p>
    <p>ing net­works, is also beef­ing up its head­count.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Chee Kiong said: “I’m hir­ing elec­tri­cal en­gi­neers, project man­agers, soft­ware prod­uct man­agers and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment pro­fes­sion­als.”</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can EV man­u­fac­turer Tesla has also been re­cruit­ing ahead of its re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, which is likely to be next year.</p>
    <p>Jobs ad­ver­tised in­clude coun­try man­ager, store leader, ve­hi­cle op­er­a­tions spe­cial­ist, ser­vice ad­viser, ser­vice tech­ni­cian, charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture man­ager and cus­tomer sup­port spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>Mr Christie Fer­nan­dez, founder of Sooorya EV, an elec­tric last-mile taxi start-up head­quar­tered here, said: “Sin­ga­pore has an op­por­tu­nity to be­come the EV hub in Asia by be­ing the sales head­quar­ters for Chi­nese EV com­pa­nies – which can cre­ate a lot of lo­cal jobs in sales, mar­ket­ing, sup­port, as­sem­bly, test­ing and R&D (re­search and de­vel­op­ment).”</p>
    <p>While there are no EV-spe­cific ter­tiary cour­ses, Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign in­terim provost Lim Seh Chun said ex­ist­ing dis­ci­plines pro­vide stu­dents with a sound foun­da­tion for the new in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“The more crit­i­cal el­e­ment in pre­par­ing them for jobs in the EV in­dus­try is the op­por­tu­nity to be in­volved in a project to de­sign and build an EV,” Pro­fes­sor Lim said, re­fer­ring to ac­tiv­i­ties rang­ing from on-the­job train­ing to school projects.</p>
    <p>“It would not be pos­si­ble, within the lim­ited time­frame of a typ­i­cal un­der­grad­u­ate en­gi­neer­ing pro­gramme, to equip them for a ca­reer in the EV in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, as much as the new econ­omy will cre­ate new jobs, it could well de­stroy old ones.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, Ger­man au­to­mo­tive gi­ant Daim­ler an­nounced that it was cut­ting at least 10,000 jobs by 2022 as it pre­pared to ramp up its elec­tri­fi­ca­tion plans.</p>
    <p>That same month, Audi said it would axe up to 9,500 jobs.</p>
    <p>Volk­swa­gen and au­to­mo­tive parts sup­plier Con­ti­nen­tal have said they would each shave 5,000 jobs, while Bosch aims to cut more than 2,000 po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Amer­i­can car­maker Ford plans to scrap some 5,000 jobs in Ger­many alone.</p>
    <p>The moves are not un­ex­pected. EVs are made up of far fewer parts than com­bus­tion engine cars, and are less me­chan­i­cally com­plex.</p>
    <p>And, in the case of smart fac­to­ries such as Hyundai Mo­tor’s, a high de­gree of au­to­ma­tion will also mean less re­liance on hu­mans.</p>
    <p>We see the fu­ture of EV jobs here. Man­u­fac­tur­ing an EV is easy enough, but we want to have the ca­pa­bil­ity of mak­ing our own bat­tery packs in Sin­ga­pore.</p>

    <p>GET­TING IN­VOLVED</p>
    <p>The more crit­i­cal el­e­ment in pre­par­ing them for jobs in the EV in­dus­try is the op­por­tu­nity to be in­volved in a project to de­sign and build an EV.</p>
