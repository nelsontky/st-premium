    <p>A blog­ger, who has been fea­tured rid­ing her mo­tor­cy­cle over­seas var­i­ous times by the me­dia, was awarded $60,000 in dam­ages af­ter win­ning a defama­tion suit in the State Courts on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a trial, the court found that so­cial me­dia per­son­al­ity Vaune Phan had been de­famed by Mr Mark Yeow last year.</p>
    <p>He had posted three defam­a­tory state­ments on Face­book and had sent a sep­a­rate one to a What­sApp chat group, court doc­u­ments state.</p>
    <p>Ms Phan was rep­re­sented by lawyers Suresh Divyanatha­n and Cherisse Foo from Oon & Bazul LLP.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeow, the chief me­chanic at a mo­tor­cy­cle work­shop and the op­er­a­tions di­rec­tor at an­other, was rep­re­sented by lawyers Luo Ling Ling and Shar­i­fah Na­bi­lah from Luo Ling Ling LLC.</p>
    <p>Among other things, he had in­sin­u­ated that Ms Phan had lied dur­ing pro­ceed­ings in the Small Claims Tri­bunal (SCT) over her dis­pute with a mo­tor­cy­cle work­shop, Revol­ogy Bikes.</p>
    <p>The blog­ger had claimed that Revol­ogy dam­aged her mo­tor­cy­cle when it re­in­stalled a cam­era that it had pre­vi­ously fixed on the ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>In her SCT claim filed on Dec 21, 2018, she said there was a “size­able gap” be­tween the fair­ings and the body of the mo­tor­cy­cle af­ter it was re­turned to her.</p>
    <p>On Dec 30 that year, Ms Phan pub­lished a Face­book post on the in­ci­dent with Revol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeow pub­lished a se­ries of com­ments on her post in Jan­uary last year, call­ing her a “cheap­skate”, among other things, and also ac­cus­ing her of cy­ber bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post the next month, he ques­tioned her in­tegrity and her SCT claim, tag­ging her past, present and po­ten­tial spon­sors, busi­ness part­ners and other mo­tor­cy­cle work­shops in his post.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeow sub­se­quently in­cluded a link to the post in a mes­sage to a What­sApp chat group, in which he also used the words “cheat­ing” and “karma”, in March that year.</p>
    <p>In the same month, the SCT or­dered Revol­ogy to pay the blog­ger $4,630 as com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In May last year, Mr Yeow com­mented on Ms Phan again on a Face­book post by elec­tron­ics com­pany Sam­sung.</p>
    <p>The post was an ad­ver­tise­ment for a new mo­bile phone and fea­tured the blog­ger, who had been con­tracted to pro­mote it.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing Sam­sung with an­other Face­book ac­count, he said the com­pany “should do some home­work and fact-find­ing be­fore hir­ing an in­flu­encer” and there</p>
    <p>were plenty of ca­pa­ble in­di­vid­u­als “who can show you what dirt bik­ing means”.</p>
    <p>The ad­ver­tise­ment was later re­moved, and Ms Phan’s con­tract to pro­mote the mo­bile phone was ter­mi­nated.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, District Judge Wong Peck said in her judg­ment that Mr Yeow’s re­marks were not jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Among other things, she dis­agreed with his ex­pla­na­tion that Ms Phan’s be­hav­iour had caused loss to Revol­ogy’s busi­ness and was there­fore “cy­ber bul­ly­ing”.</p>
    <p>Not­ing Mr Yeow’s at­tempts to prove that the blog­ger had lied dur­ing the SCT pro­ceed­ings, she said:</p>
    <p>“My view is that it is not open to this court to ex­am­ine the SCT de­ci­sion and find­ings of fact.”</p>
    <p>She also or­dered Mr Yeow to pay le­gal costs to Ms Phan, take down his Face­book state­ments and re­frain from mak­ing sim­i­lar defam­a­tory re­marks against her again.</p>
    <p>But the judge did not al­low Ms Phan’s claim for dam­ages for the ter­mi­na­tion of her con­tract to pro­mote the mo­bile phone, rul­ing that she had not proven it was due to Mr Yeow’s re­marks.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeow told The Straits Times that he in­tends to ap­peal against the de­ci­sion.</p>
