    <p>For 12 min­utes on Tues­day, an SBS Tran­sit bus driver was be­rated and then beaten up by a pas­sen­ger who boarded the bus with­out wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit de­tailed the as­sault in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, say­ing that it hap­pened at about 2.45pm, when a 52-year-old male com­muter boarded ser­vice 21 at Pasir Ris Drive 6 with­out a mask.</p>
    <p>The man, who put on his mask only later, hurled vul­gar­i­ties at the 39-year-old bus driver, and this con­tin­ued for the du­ra­tion of two bus stops.</p>
    <p>He be­gan to phys­i­cally abuse the bus driver after the driver stopped the bus in front of Block 210 at Pasir Ris Drive 1 to wait for the po­lice to ar­rive.</p>
    <p>“The man grabbed the bus cap­tain’s (BC) neck and col­lar, hold­ing on for more than a minute. He re­fused to let go even when our BC pleaded with him to do so,” said SBS Tran­sit.</p>
    <p>“Our BC could be seen cow­er­ing with his arms shield­ing his face as the man started punch­ing him re­peat­edly on the head.”</p>
    <p>Three young men at the bus stop boarded the bus and tack­led the man, drag­ging him out of the ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit said they pinned him down un­til the po­lice ar­rived.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, po­lice said they ar­rested the man for vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt as well as for pos­ses­sion of an of­fen­sive weapon. In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit noted that sev­eral of its driv­ers have been at­tacked for en­forc­ing the re­quire­ment to wear a mask. De­nounc­ing the as­saults, the trans­port op­er­a­tor said: “This is re­pug­nant. And this must stop.”</p>
    <p>It said it has close to 40 cases of pub­lic bus staff be­ing as­saulted this year, about half of which were mask-re­lated. This was up from 33 cases in the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice and trans­port staff have come un­der in­creased pres­sure dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, with some pa­trons or com­muters un­happy when told to fol­low the rules.</p>
    <p>The bus driver was taken con­scious to Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal after the as­sault and given three days of med­i­cal leave.</p>
    <p>At­tach­ing a photo of the bat­tered driver, SBS Tran­sit said: “We are thank­ful that he did not sus­tain any se­ri­ous in­juries. He is shaken but re­mains in good spir­its.”</p>
    <p>Last month, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said abuse against trans­port staff was in­ex­cus­able.</p>
    <p>In the in­ci­dent that prompted his post, a man was seen in a 15minute-long video shout­ing at a bus driver who would not let him board the bus as he was wear­ing a neck gaiter in­stead of a face mask.</p>
