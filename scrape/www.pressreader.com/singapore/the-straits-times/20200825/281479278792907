    <p>CRIT­I­CAL JUNC­TURE</p>
    <p>If we fail to flat­ten the curve this week, we be­lieve we will be faced with a very im­por­tant cri­sis, that the virus will spread to the en­tire na­tion. ’’</p>
    <p>HEALTH MIN­ISTRY OF­FI­CIAL</p>
    <p>YOON TAE-HO, not­ing that in­ves­ti­ga­tors had been un­able to de­ter­mine the trans­mis­sion routes of about 20 per cent of re­cent cases, rais­ing con­cern about so-called si­lent spread­ers. He called on peo­ple to avoid leav­ing home and to can­cel any un­nec­es­sary trips out.</p>
    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s cap­i­tal has, for the first time, or­dered masks to be worn in both in­door and out­door pub­lic places as it bat­tles a surge in coro­n­avirus cases cen­tred in the densely pop­u­lated metropoli­tan area.</p>
    <p>In May, the city govern­ment or­dered that masks be worn on pub­lic trans­port and in taxis, but a re­cent spike in cases has health of­fi­cials wor­ried that the coun­try may need to im­pose its high­est level of so­cial dis­tanc­ing, known as phase three.</p>
    <p>“If we can’t stop it at this stage, we have no choice but to up­grade to the third phase of so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in told his top aides yes­ter­day. “The raise to phase three is by no means an easy op­tion.”</p>
    <p>Un­der phase three, schools and busi­ness will be urged to close, in­flict­ing more dam­age on Asia’s fourth-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (KCDC) re­ported 266 new cases as of mid­night on Sun­day, down from 397 a day ear­lier, but another in more than a week of triple-digit daily in­creases.</p>
    <p>South Korea has been widely praised for its suc­cess in tack­ling the virus, with ex­ten­sive test­ing and ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing, but health min­istry of­fi­cial Yoon Tae-ho said in­ves­ti­ga­tors had been un­able to de­ter­mine the trans­mis­sion routes of about 20 per cent of re­cent cases, rais­ing con­cern about so­called si­lent spread­ers.</p>
    <p>He called on peo­ple to avoid leav­ing home and to can­cel any un­nec­es­sary trips out.</p>
    <p>“If we fail to flat­ten the curve this week, we be­lieve we will be faced with a very im­por­tant cri­sis, that the virus will spread to the en­tire na­tion,” Mr Yoon told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>South Korea has recorded an av­er­age of 162.1 daily in­fec­tions over the past two weeks – 13 times the av­er­age of two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, 84 per cent were in the Seoul metropoli­tan area, the KCDC said.</p>
    <p>South Korea has had more than 17,000 cases and re­ported 309 deaths since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>The re­cent in­fec­tion resur­gence is largely due to large-scale eco­nomic re­open­ing and re­laxed so­cial dis­tanc­ing, ac­cord­ing to a re­port from JP­Mor­gan Chase.</p>
    <p>The re­port pre­dicts that the lat­est wave of coro­n­avirus cases might in­fect about 7,000 peo­ple till early Novem­ber, with net in­fec­tions to peak by the end of this month.</p>
    <p>The out­break will be smaller in scale than seen pre­vi­ously, as test­ing and trac­ing have been strength­ened with stricter so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules in place, in­sur­ance an­a­lysts led by Mr M.W. Kim wrote in the note dated last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>JP­Mor­gan’s pre­vi­ous fore­cast in Fe­bru­ary that South Korea’s virus cases in March would peak at about 10,000 in its first wave proved to be ac­cu­rate: To­tal in­fec­tions were at 9,786 at the end of March, and new cases fell af­ter that.</p>
