    <p>It may be sev­eral weeks to Dry Jan­uary, when peo­ple usu­ally re­pent for fes­tive drinking by giv­ing up booze for a month.</p>
    <p>But the move to­wards well­ness and the thirst for hang­over-free op­tions is no longer re­stricted to start-of-the-year guilt-trips.</p>
    <p>It is slowly but surely be­com­ing a lifestyle choice, with savvy re­tail­ers and bev­er­age man­u­fac­tur­ers spy­ing a lu­cra­tive mar­ket in the al­co­hol-free and non-al­co­holic bev­er­age scene that has been build­ing steam world­wide.</p>
    <p>Not only are th­ese bev­er­ages low-calo­rie op­tions, but some are also ve­gan and gluten-free. Be­yond ap­peal­ing to those tak­ing a short break from drinking or es­chew­ing it al­to­gether, they are also suit­able for preg­nant women, those train­ing for sports events and those with al­ler­gies.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, both small bou­tique play­ers like newly launched al­co­hol-free bot­tle shop, Free Spirit, and big su­per­mar­ket chains such as Cold Stor­age and FairPrice are tak­ing the grow­ing trend se­ri­ously, and feel that it is here to stay.</p>
    <p>“The trend to­wards non-al­co­holic beers and wines is on the climb, so we are prepar­ing our­selves for that,” says Ms Fiona Stephens, Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional’s South-east Asia re­gional head of com­mer­cial beer, wine, spir­its and drinks.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of Dairy Far­mowned Cold Stor­age stores stock a full se­lec­tion of non-al­co­holic beers and wines, in­clud­ing Aus­tralia’s Lyre’s non-al­co­holic spir­its. Lyre’s range of 13 flavours uses nat­u­ral ex­tracts and dis­til­lates de­rived from fruit, botan­i­cals, spices and other nat­u­ral sources to recre­ate the flavours of bour­bon whiskey, gin, white and dark rum, ver­mouth and pop­u­lar liqueurs and aper­i­tifs.</p>
    <p>Lyre’s gin-equiv­a­lent called Lon­don Dry Spirit is priced at $59.90, com­pared with lead­ing pre­mium gins like Bom­bay Sap­phire and Tan­queray, which hover around the $65 to $70 mark. At bou­tique re­tail­ers, most non-al­co­holic gins are priced around the same as lead­ing al­co­holic pre­mium gins.</p>
    <p>Ms Stephens says they “worked closely with Lyre’s to make sure its range was priced be­low its al­co­holic coun­ter­parts, as we feel this is fair given that we do not pay duty on th­ese”.</p>
    <p>While Cold Stor­age has been sell­ing such non-al­co­holic spir­its in its larger stores, it is now look­ing to roll out a core range across its smaller out­lets, as well as have ded­i­cated Low & No Al­co­hol sec­tions in key stores, says Ms Stephens.</p>
    <p>Non-al­co­holic bev­er­age op­tions are also avail­able on its on­line store, as well as fea­ture in its Christ­mas cat­a­logue for the first time this year.</p>
    <p>At FairPrice, non-al­co­holic beers – such as Heineken 0.0 and Carls­berg Al­co­hol-Free pil­sner and wheat beer – are avail­able across all its stores in Sin­ga­pore, while non-al­co­holic wines are avail­able only at FairPrice Finest.</p>
    <p>FairPrice says it has ob­served a steady growth in the sales of non-al­co­holic bev­er­ages since their in­tro­duc­tion in 2018. “We will con­tinue to mon­i­tor cus­tomers’ re­cep­tiv­ity to­wards th­ese prod­ucts and cater to con­sumer de­mand ac­cord­ingly,” says a spokesman.</p>
    <p>SMALLER PLAY­ERS RID­ING THE WAVE</p>
    <p>Even smaller play­ers are en­ter­ing the al­co­hol-free space, both as re­tail­ers and pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>Health-con­scious en­trepreneur­s Emma Pike and Re­becca For­wood, both in their 40s, de­cided to start on­line bot­tle shop Free Spirit last month after re­al­is­ing that non-al­co­holic beers, wines and spir­its were not as read­ily avail­able here, com­pared with their home coun­try, Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Most of their prod­ucts are sourced from there, and in­clude Mel­bourne-based brands like Brunswick Aces and ALTD spir­its, along­side pop­u­lar Bri­tish prod­uct Seedlip – a pi­o­neer­ing en­trant to the non-al­co­holic dis­tilled spir­its space that first launched in Sin­ga­pore in 2018.</p>
    <p>“I de­cided to take a 90-day break from drinking al­co­hol ear­lier this year and it was vir­tu­ally im­pos­si­ble to find a good range of al­ter­na­tives to al­co­hol, which was re­ally frus­trat­ing,” re­calls Ms Pike.</p>
    <p>“Re­becca had ex­pe­ri­enced the same chal­lenges. As en­trepreneur­s, our in­stinct was to pro­vide the so­lu­tion our­selves and we got to­gether and launched Free Spirit.”</p>
    <p>Ms For­wood also runs food re­tail busi­ness The Fish­wives, while Ms Pike founded on­line butcher Farmer’s Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>They now stock more than 30 brands, in­clud­ing mix­ers, and add to the col­lec­tion every month, pri­ori­tis­ing so­phis­ti­cated flavours and unique prod­ucts not easy to find any­where else.</p>
    <p>An­other en­trant to the grow­ing mar­ket is Ms Lorin Wi­nata, 27, who launched Me­lati – Asia’s first pre­mium non-al­co­holic aper­i­tif –</p>
    <p>which is made from 26 Asian botan­i­cals, in­clud­ing goji berry, hibis­cus and raw ca­cao.</p>
    <p>It was de­vel­oped over two years, fol­low­ing a visit to her an­ces­tral farm­land in Jatiluwih, Bali. The visit got her think­ing about how to cre­ate a prod­uct that utilises “the restora­tive prop­er­ties of th­ese in­gre­di­ents, yet is so­cially ac­cept­able – and en­joy­able – at par­ties, or as a way to un­wind after a busy work week”.</p>
    <p>Ms Wi­nata, a Sin­ga­porean who held roles across the in­vest­ment and food and bev­er­age in­dus­tries prior to soft-launch­ing Me­lati in Septem­ber, notes: “There was also a lack of so­phis­ti­cated, adult-fo­cused booze al­ter­na­tives that both sat­is­fied and pro­vided the same com­plex­ity as booze to match the high qual­ity of food I was en­joy­ing when vis­it­ing some of my favourite res­tau­rants.”</p>
    <p>Me­lati is now served at res­tau­rants in­clud­ing Miche­lin-starred Odette and Nouri, and the team is work­ing on a new ad­di­tion to the range which it is hop­ing to launch in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>READY TO DRINK</p>
    <p>The con­ve­nient, straight out of a can or bot­tle RTD (ready to drink) cat­e­gory is also on the rise.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing al­co­holic bev­er­age data anal­y­sis firm IWSR says the non-al­co­holic spir­its cat­e­gory is pro­jected to rebound quickly from this year’s slump in sales, adding that glob­ally, “con­sumers have shown a propen­sity for re­fresh­ing, flavour­ful and longer-to-con­sume drinks, which bodes well for RTDs”.</p>
    <p>IWSR pre­dicts that RTDs, which saw a boost in pop­u­lar­ity dur­ing global lock­downs, are ex­pected to post vol­ume gains of 21.8 per cent com­pound an­nual growth rate in the 2019-to-2024 pe­riod, steal­ing share pri­mar­ily from the beer cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>More play­ers from around the world are also en­ter­ing the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In­dian bev­er­age com­pany Svami – best known for its craft tonic water range – is mak­ing a push in the RTD space with its range of Zero Proof non-al­co­holic aer­ated bev­er­ages, kick­ing off with rum and cola, and gin and tonic vari­ants.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is one of the first mar­kets, out­side of In­dia, where it will be launch­ing the new prod­ucts in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>For its gin and tonic cock­tail, Svami co-founder Aneesh Bhasin says they use clas­sic gin botan­i­cals like ju­niper, or­ris root and dif­fer­ent cit­ruses to repli­cate the taste. For rum and cola, they tap the flavours of vanilla, caramel and oak, with a dose of lime, to keep the drink fresh and rounded.</p>
    <p>“We also have an IPA Lemon­ade and a non-al­co­holic ne­groni spritz in the works,” says Mr Bhasin, who says they wanted to in­tro­duce “more op­tions apart from reg­u­lar aer­ated drinks and pack­aged juices”.</p>
    <p>Cold Stor­age says it is look­ing to bring in sim­i­lar RTDs, such as pre­mixed non-al­co­holic gin and tonic drinks.</p>
    <p>The over­all sen­ti­ment is that the lower al­co­hol and al­co­hol-free lifestyle is here to stay.</p>
    <p>Free Spirit’s Ms Pike says: “There is a grow­ing rum­ble in the al­co­hol­free space in Sin­ga­pore and I feel we have only just scratched the sur­face.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mix­ture be­tween over-con­sump­tion of al­co­hol dur­ing Covid-19 and more peo­ple tak­ing their health more se­ri­ously.”</p>
    <p>Ms Wi­nata adds: “The rise of cu­rios­ity to­wards sober op­tions is in­creas­ing, and I feel this is only the be­gin­ning of the road for non­al­co­holic spir­its and aper­i­tifs, and I am ex­cited to see how the cat­e­gory evolves in the com­ing years.”</p>
