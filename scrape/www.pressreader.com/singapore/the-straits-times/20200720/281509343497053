    <p>Over $4 bil­lion un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) will be paid out to 140,000 em­ploy­ers from July 29, to help about 1.9 mil­lion lo­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>With this lat­est pay­out, the to­tal amount dis­bursed un­der the scheme – which sub­sidises up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 in monthly wages for each lo­cal worker – will ex­ceed $15 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble em­ploy­ers will be no­ti­fied by post and can also view an elec­tronic copy on myTax Por­tal.</p>
    <p>Those with PayNow Cor­po­rate or Giro arrangemen­ts with the tax­man can ex­pect pay­outs from July 29. Oth­ers will get their pay­outs through cheques from Aug 4.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also warned of se­vere penal­ties for any at­tempts to abuse the scheme, in­clud­ing de­nial of pay­outs, jail terms and fines.</p>
    <p>Over $4 bil­lion un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) will be paid out to 140,000 em­ploy­ers from July 29 to help them re­tain their work­ers amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This will help busi­nesses to pay the wages of some 1.9 mil­lion lo­cal em­ploy­ees in to­tal, the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With this lat­est round of pay­outs, the to­tal amount dis­bursed un­der the scheme will ex­ceed $15 bil­lion, said the min­istry in a joint state­ment with the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras).</p>
    <p>The JSS was in­tro­duced in the first Bud­get sup­port pack­age by</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in Fe­bru­ary, and en­hanced in the three suc­ces­sive pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, firms can get up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages for each lo­cal worker sub­sidised. Sec­tors more badly hit by the pan­demic, such as avi­a­tion and tourism, get more help.</p>
    <p>MOF and Iras said this month’s pay­ment goes to­wards sup­port­ing wages paid to lo­cal work­ers in Fe­bru­ary and March. All em­ploy­ers will also get 75 per cent sup­port for wages paid in April, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. Part of this was al­ready given as an ad­vance that month “to pro­vide im­me­di­ate cash flow sup­port”, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>As the amount dis­bursed was cal­cu­lated based on last Oc­to­ber’s wages, the up­com­ing pay­out will be ad­justed ac­cord­ing to ac­tual wages paid this April, they added.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble em­ploy­ers will be no­ti­fied by post of the pay­out and can also log in to myTax Por­tal to view the elec­tronic copy of the let­ter.</p>
    <p>Those with PayNow Cor­po­rate or Giro arrangemen­ts with Iras can ex­pect their pay­outs from July 29.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers will re­ceive their pay­outs through cheques from Aug 4 but can re­ceive their pay­outs ear­lier if they sign up for PayNow Cor­po­rate with their banks by Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should make sure that manda­tory Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions made for their em­ploy­ees are ac­cu­rate, so that they re­ceive the right amounts of JSS pay­out, added Iras and MOF.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that have ben­e­fited from the JSS said they were grate­ful for the sup­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Pek Lian Guan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of con­struc­tion firm Tiong Seng Hold­ings, said the scheme has been crit­i­cal to keep­ing its work­ers. “With­out the JSS sup­port, we would not have been able to re­tain our staff and con­tinue to pay their salaries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Mr Chin Zheng, busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­ager at eatery Stuff’d, said the pay­outs helped to keep its out­lets open and sup­port its work­ers with mea­sures such as in­ter­est-free loans and pay­ing staff from vul­ner­a­ble groups to stay at home dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Iras and MOF also warned of se­vere penal­ties for any at­tempts to abuse the scheme, in­clud­ing hav­ing the pay­outs de­nied, and be­ing jailed for up to 10 years and fined.</p>
    <p>Those who want to re­port mal­prac­tices or po­ten­tial abuses of the</p>
    <p>JSS can e-mail jss­re­port@iras.gov.sg or visit go.gov.sg/jss­re­port</p>
    <p>As part of the checks for JSS el­i­gi­bil­ity, a very small num­ber of em­ploy­ers will re­ceive let­ters from Iras to ask them to ver­ify their CPF con­tri­bu­tions and to pro­vide dec­la­ra­tions or doc­u­ments to sub­stan­ti­ate their el­i­gi­bil­ity for JSS pay­outs.</p>
    <p>Their pay­outs for this month will be with­held in the mean­time but will be paid out once the in­for­ma­tion is in or­der, said MOF and Iras.</p>
    <p>Post­ing on Face­book yes­ter­day, Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter, urged all em­ploy­ers to do their ut­most to re­tain their staff.</p>
    <p>He also said busi­nesses should take the op­por­tu­nity to trans­form their oper­a­tions and up­skill em­ploy­ees dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, we can emerge stronger from this cri­sis,” he said.</p>
