    <p>CHRISTCHUR­CH • The Can­ter­bury Cru­saders needed their leg­endary storm­ing fin­ish to beat the Otago High­landers 32-22 and claim New Zealand’s Super Rugby ti­tle with a game to spare in Christchur­ch yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Three tries in the fi­nal quar­ter, two to Ge­orge Bridge, se­cured their fourth suc­ces­sive Super ti­tle, but coach Scott Robert­son im­me­di­ately shut down talk of extravagan­t cel­e­bra­tions, cit­ing English foot­ball club Liver­pool’s ex­pe­ri­ence of win­ning a cham­pi­onship be­fore the end of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s a cel­e­bra­tion with cur­fews tonight,” he said, as he also re­fused to per­form the trade­mark break­dance he has pro­duced af­ter pre­vi­ous ti­tle wins.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t feel quite right. We haven’t fin­ished the job yet. There’ll be another time for that.</p>
    <p>“We’re very mind­ful that’s the awk­ward­ness of win­ning it as we’ve done.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand what Liver­pool went through when they took the tro­phy early,” he said.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool were beaten 4-0 by Manch­ester City in their first game af­ter se­cur­ing the Premier League with seven matches re­main­ing, and Robert­son warned that the Cru­saders would not ease up when they face the Auck­land Blues in the fi­nal round next week­end.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mean any­thing if we don’t do the job next week,” added veteran lock Sam White­lock.</p>
    <p>The lit­tle-fan­cied High­landers led for the first 60 min­utes against the Cru­saders but could not hold back the red wave as the Cru­saders took con­trol in the fi­nal quar­ter – a pe­riod which has pro­duced 40 per cent of their points in the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Bridge scored two tries in two min­utes for the Cru­saders to be ahead for the first time in the 62nd minute and Bray­den En­nor ce­mented the win with a try five min­utes from time.</p>
    <p>“We were on the ropes for a lot of the game, but there were just some mo­ments where key guys stood up,” Robert­son said.</p>
    <p>Cru­saders won three Super Rugby ti­tles in a row be­fore the coro­n­avirus crushed this year’s com­pe­ti­tion in mid-March, and it was re­placed by New Zealand’s hastily ar­ranged do­mes­tic Aotearoa tour­na­ment be­tween the coun­try’s five Super Rugby sides.</p>
    <p>The four-tries-to-three vic­tory snuffed out the faint ti­tle hopes held by the Welling­ton Hur­ri­canes and Auck­land Blues and ef­fec­tively ended the com­pe­ti­tion a week early.</p>
