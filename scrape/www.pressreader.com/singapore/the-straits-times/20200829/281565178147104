    <p>Tens of thou­sands of peo­ple were ex­pected to march in Washington yes­ter­day to de­nounce racism, protest po­lice bru­tal­ity and com­mem­o­rate the an­niver­sary of the march in 1963 where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr made his “I Have a Dream” speech. This comes af­ter a sum­mer of protests sparked by the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd.</p>
    <p>• Tens of thou­sands of peo­ple were ex­pected to march in Washington yes­ter­day to de­nounce racism, protest against po­lice bru­tal­ity and com­mem­o­rate the an­niver­sary of the march in 1963 where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr made his “I have a dream” speech.</p>
    <p>In his his­toric and of­ten-re­peated speech, Mr King en­vi­sioned a time when his chil­dren would “live in a na­tion where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the con­tent of their char­ac­ter”.</p>
    <p>Its 57th an­niver­sary comes at the end of a sum­mer of racial un­rest and na­tion­wide protests, sparked by the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an un­armed African Amer­i­can, af­ter a Min­neapo­lis po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck for nearly nine min­utes.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, protests seized Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, af­ter po­lice of­fi­cers shot an­other African Amer­i­can man, Mr Ja­cob Blake, mul­ti­ple times in front of his young chil­dren while his back was turned.</p>
    <p>Mr Blake sur­vived the shoot­ing but has been paral­ysed, his lawyers told re­porters ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s planned protest, called Com­mit­ment March: Get Your Knee Off Our Necks, was planned in the wake of Mr Floyd’s death by civil rights ac­tivist Al Sharp­ton’s Na­tional Ac­tion Net­work. Mr Ben Crump, the civil rights lawyer rep­re­sent­ing Mr Blake and Mr Floyd’s fam­ily, will speak, as will Rev­erend Sharp­ton, Mr Floyd’s fam­ily mem­bers, and Mr King’s son Martin Luther King III, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Af­ter speeches at the Lin­coln Me­mo­rial, par­tic­i­pants will walk to the Martin Luther King me­mo­rial about a kilo­me­tre away.</p>
    <p>The march also comes as black peo­ple have suf­fered dis­pro­por­tion­ately from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has killed about 180,000 Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the live march, there will be a vir­tual com­mem­o­ra­tion fea­tur­ing Rev­erend Wil­liam Bar­ber, a prom­i­nent civil rights ac­tivist and the co-chair of the Poor Peo­ple’s Cam­paign. It will also in­clude civil rights ac­tivists, politi­cians, artists and en­ter­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ker­ri­gan Wil­liams, a founder of Free­dom Fight­ers DC, said the group was or­gan­is­ing its own march yes­ter­day af­ter the Washington march, to pro­mote a more rad­i­cal agenda that in­cludes re­plac­ing po­lice de­part­ments with other pub­lic safety sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, a wing of the Move­ment for Black Lives, a net­work of black ac­tivists and or­gan­i­sa­tions, had sched­uled the Black Na­tional</p>
    <p>Con­ven­tion for last night, fol­low­ing na­tional con­ven­tions by the Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can par­ties. It will fea­ture about 100 black ac­tivists, said an or­gan­iser.</p>
