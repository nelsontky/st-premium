    <p>How to work at heights safely after the cir­cuit breaker. How to take care of your safety and health while work­ing from home. These are but some of the new train­ing ma­te­ri­als that the Work­place Safety and Health (WSH) Coun­cil has added to its arse­nal of re­sources on work­place safety and health since the out­break of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The global pan­demic has forced gov­ern­ments and busi­nesses world­wide to re-ex­am­ine and re­de­fine how they ap­proach work­place safety and health at large. In Sin­ga­pore, ex­ist­ing pro­to­cols and guide­lines for keep­ing work­ers safe at their work­place had to be tight­ened and up­dated con­tin­u­ally to help work­places plan for the mit­i­ga­tion of Covid-19 — and the post-pan­demic fu­ture.</p>
    <p>A cham­pion for work­place safety and health since it was es­tab­lished in 2008, the WSH Coun­cil has been work­ing closely with its tri­par­tite part­ners — the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) and Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) — to gen­er­ate greater aware­ness, as well as drive adop­tion of safe man­age­ment mea­sures at the work­place.</p>
    <p>With more work­ers al­lowed to re­turn to their work­places, the WSH Coun­cil’s role in keep­ing em­ploy­ees safe can­not be over­stated.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, safety and health stan­dards at the work­place were fo­cused on oc­cu­pa­tion-cen­tred risks such as falls from height, slips, trips and falls, and ac­ci­dents in­volv­ing heavy ve­hi­cles and ma­chin­ery such as trucks and fork­lifts.</p>
    <p>Since the out­break of Covid-19, the scope has ex­panded to in­clude safe man­age­ment mea­sures to pre­vent the spread of dis­eases: Split-team ar­range</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has not only spurred the us­age of dig­i­tal so­lu­tions, but also changed the way we en­gage the in­dus­try and the com­mu­nity. Look­ing ahead, dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion will be nec­es­sary for us to con­tinue to func­tion, and to con­tinue to pro­mote the adop­tion of good WSH prac­tices across busi­ness com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>MR JOHN NG, chair­man of the WSH Coun­cil</p>
    <p>ments, reg­u­lar tem­per­a­ture mea­sure­ments, con­tact trac­ing and more.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing its cue from the au­thor­i­ties, the WSH Coun­cil had to quickly come up with strate­gies to bridge the gap be­tween the govern­ment agen­cies and the pri­vate sec­tor, while en­sur­ing a seam­less adop­tion of new pro­to­cols and guide­lines at the work­place.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, new safe man­age­ment mea­sures were in­te­grated into WSH Coun­cil’s StartSAFE, a free pro­gramme to help small- and medium-sized en­ter­prises iden­tify WSH risks and im­ple­ment best prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The WSH Coun­cil has also lever­aged its ties with stake­hold­ers such as the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tu­tion of Safety Of­fi­cers and NTUC to ed­u­cate safe man­age­ment of­fi­cers of com­pa­nies, and worked with union lead­ers in de­vel­op­ing and putting in place safe man­age­ment mea­sures in sec­tors rang­ing from con­struc­tion to man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Some busi­nesses have em­braced tech­nol­ogy to ad­here to new work­place safety guide­lines. Con­struc­tion com­pany BHCC Con­struc­tion adopts ther­mal scan­ners, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence cam­eras and safe-dis­tanc­ing to­kens to re­duce health risks while phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Am­gen em­ploys the use of a web/mo­bile app plat­form to keep em­ploy­ees’ daily tem­per­a­ture record­ing, SafeEn­try data log and travel dec­la­ra­tions all in one place for easy mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>As com­pa­nies re­sume op­er­a­tions, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad has called upon firms not to ne­glect the fun­da­men­tals of work­place safety.</p>
    <p>While com­pa­nies may feel an ur­gency to make up for lost time, he urged em­ploy­ers to relook safety poli­cies, give work­ers time to ad­just and con­duct re­fresher train­ing if needed, re­ported The Straits Times last month.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s im­por­tant to put back mea­sures that we used to have, and en­sure that as we restart, while there’s some­times cer­tain pres­sures to get back on track and to catch up on lost time, this is not at the ex­pense of work­ers’ safety and health,” he said on Oct 22, after a visit to a con­struc­tion work­site at the Chi­nese Gar­den.</p>
    <p>Mr John Ng, chair­man of the WSH Coun­cil, also high­lights that Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures are to be seen as an added cri­te­rion to over­all WSH per­for­mance in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He adds: “The pan­demic has not only spurred the us­age of dig­i­tal so­lu­tions, but also changed the way we en­gage the in­dus­try and the com­mu­nity. Look­ing ahead, dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion will be nec­es­sary for us to con­tinue to func­tion, and to con­tinue to pro­mote the adop­tion of good WSH prac­tices across busi­ness com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
