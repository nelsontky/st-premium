    <p>When Amer­i­can au­thor Josh Maler­man was writ­ing his hit postapoc­a­lyp­tic hor­ror novel Bird Box (2014), he at­tempted to walk around his neigh­bour­hood blind­folded.</p>
    <p>“I moved re­ally slowly, pay­ing a lot of at­ten­tion to sound,” re­calls the 45-year-old. “I was tak­ing one baby step, feel­ing around, then another baby step. It would have taken me a month to make it 100 miles.”</p>
    <p>In Bird Box, the world is in­vaded by crea­tures who drive any­one who sees them mad, caus­ing them to kill them­selves or oth­ers. The rem­nants of hu­man­ity sur­vive by blind­fold­ing them­selves when­ever they go out.</p>
    <p>It was adapted in 2018 into a Net­flix film star­ring San­dra Bullock. De­spite mixed re­views, it be­came Net­flix’s sec­ond most pop­u­lar orig­i­nal movie of all time, watched by 89 mil­lion users in the first four weeks af­ter its de­but.</p>
    <p>Maler­man is now re­turn­ing to the world of Bird Box with a se­quel, Malo­rie, named for the pro­tag­o­nist played by Bullock in the film.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the movie, I was like, I want more of Malo­rie,” he says over Skype from Michi­gan, where he lives with his fi­ancee, artist and mu­si­cian Al­li­son Laakko.</p>
    <p>In Bird Box, Malo­rie sur­vives a mas­sacre at the house where she is hid­ing and raises two chil­dren, a boy to whom she gave birth and a girl whose mother died af­ter see­ing a crea­ture while in labour.</p>
    <p>In or­der to get to a safe haven, Malo­rie and the chil­dren have to sail a boat down a treach­er­ous river while blind­folded.</p>
    <p>The se­quel is set 12 years af­ter the events of Bird Box. The chil­dren, Tom and Olympia, are now 16 years old. Tom, an as­pir­ing in­ven­tor, is hun­gry to learn more about the world and re­sents sur­vival­ob­sessed Malo­rie for making them live in a clois­tered state of con­stant para­noia. Sen­si­ble, book­ish Olympia has a se­cret she has never told her mother or brother.</p>
    <p>When they learn that Malo­rie’s par­ents could still be alive, they must de­cide if they should risk leav­ing their camp and take a “blind train” – one which runs slowly, with all its win­dows blacked out to pro­tect those on board – to find them.</p>
    <p>“Al­li­son came up with the blind train,” says Maler­man. “She said, ‘You know what mode of travel would to­tally work in a blind world? A train. It’s a ve­hi­cle at­tached to a road that’s al­ready estab­lished.’”</p>
    <p>The ten­sion be­tween Malo­rie and Tom’s points of view – those who “live by the fold” and those who want to look – has drawn com­par­isons to the con­flict around maskwear­ing in the United States.</p>
    <p>Both sit­u­a­tions in­volve cov­er­ing one’s face for safety rea­sons, though cer­tain peo­ple in­sist strongly on their right to walk around un­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Maler­man says such par­al­lels were un­in­ten­tional, as he wrote the book be­fore the Covid-19 out­break. “Bird Box and Malo­rie are fun scares, good scares. What’s hap­pen­ing in the world is freaky and heavy and con­fus­ing, so I’m a lit­tle hes­i­tant to draw a line.</p>
    <p>“I think the big­ger par­al­lel be­tween the two sce­nar­ios is not know­ing when it’s go­ing to end. That sort of tense im­pa­tience, I think, is what we’re all feel­ing about this pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The movie caused con­tro­versy on sev­eral fronts, not least be­cause it pre­cip­i­tated the Bird Box chal­lenge, in which peo­ple would try to do in­creas­ingly danger­ous things while blind­folded.</p>
    <p>“At first I thought it was funny, just adding to the ex­cite­ment,” says Maler­man. “The cra­zi­est one I saw was a girl rid­ing a horse, and both she and the horse were blind­folded.”</p>
    <p>Then a Utah teenager drove a pickup truck with her eyes cov­ered and hit another car, where­upon Net­flix and Maler­man had to put out state­ments warn­ing peo­ple not to at­tempt the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“It was a very strange mo­ment for me,” he says. “It was thrilling, my life was chang­ing and I was also ner­vous that peo­ple were go­ing to get hurt.”</p>
    <p>Maler­man has ac­tu­ally writ­ten 32 books, though only nine have been pub­lished. Be­tween the ages of 19 and 29, he “failed” at writ­ing four nov­els. “I made it quite far,” he says, “I just didn’t know how to end a book.”</p>
    <p>He was also busy tour­ing with his rock band The High Strung and never got round to shop­ping his steadily grow­ing pile of un­pub­lished manuscript­s – un­til a high school friend per­suaded him to send one to a lawyer who rep­re­sents au­thors. Bird Box’s film rights were snapped up by Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios even be­fore it was pub­lished.</p>
    <p>A screen adap­ta­tion of Malo­rie is in the works, though Maler­man says he can­not re­veal much about that as he is not in­volved. Like his char­ac­ters, he is in the dark.</p>
    <p>He does not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity of a third book in the Bird Box world. “I’m def­i­nitely in­ter­ested, but it would have to be a killer idea. I would just want to make sure that it ab­so­lutely lived up to the first two.”</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Bird Box and Malo­rie are fun scares, good scares. What’s hap­pen­ing in the world is freaky and heavy and con­fus­ing... I think the big­ger par­al­lel be­tween the two sce­nar­ios is not know­ing when it’s go­ing to end.</p>
