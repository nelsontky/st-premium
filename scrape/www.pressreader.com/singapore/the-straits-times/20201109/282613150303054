    <p>Le­ices­ter City 1 Wolves 0</p>
    <p>LONDON • De­spite miss­ing a spot kick yes­ter­day, Jamie Vardy has scored 10 of his last 12 penal­ties in the Premier League and he man­aged to con­vert the first of two awarded, as Le­ices­ter made it three wins on the bounce in the top flight.</p>
    <p>The hosts opened the scor­ing after 15 min­utes when the video as­sis­tant ref­eree ruled that Max Kil­man had han­dled Den­nis Praet’s cross in the area.</p>
    <p>How­ever, pun­dits were unan­i­mous in their ver­dict that Wolves were un­fairly pun­ished.</p>
    <p>For­mer Manch­ester City de­fender Micah Richards told Sky Sports: “It’s very harsh. I don’t know why it has been given. He was run­ning to the ball, that was a nat­u­ral run­ning mo­tion.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Liver­pool de­fender Jamie Car­ragher agreed that “it was harsh”, while for­mer Arse­nal striker Alan Smith ques­tioned whether ref­eree An­thony Tay­lor re­viewed the in­ci­dent only in slow mo­tion.</p>
    <p>“It seems as if his first view was in slow mo­tion,” he said. “That can’t be right. He has to look at it in full speed, surely. It al­ways looks worse in slow mo­tion.”</p>
    <p>Vardy, who was re­called after be­ing rested for Thurs­day’s Europa League win over Braga, made no mis­take from the spot to move to joint-top of the league scor­ing charts on eight goals.</p>
    <p>He was, how­ever, less clin­i­cal 24 min­utes later. His sec­ond spot kick, which came about after Rayan Ait-Nouri fouled James Justin, was far more clear cut but</p>
    <p>Rui Pa­tri­cio, who has now saved three of his last six penal­ties faced in the Premier League, saved the at­tempt with his trail­ing leg.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors huffed and puffed in the sec­ond half but could not get past Kasper Sch­me­ichel, as the Foxes earned their sixth win in a row in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Wolves man­ager Nuno Espir­ito Santo later told Sky Sports that he was dis­ap­pointed with the penalty given, say­ing: “These sit­u­a­tions are dif­fi­cult to an­a­lyse. We were pe­nalised but we re­acted well.”</p>
