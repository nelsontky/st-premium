    <p>Tak­ing a very dif­fer­ent stand from US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den on Thurs­day aligned him­self strongly with pro­test­ers of racial in­jus­tice and with black vot­ers when he met those still grap­pling with the po­lice shoot­ing of Mr Ja­cob Blake.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den was yes­ter­day set to crit­i­cise Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s stew­ard­ship of the coro­n­avirus-rav­aged econ­omy, as both cam­paigns kick into high gear with l ess than two months to go to the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has pre­vi­ously seized upon monthly jobs re­ports as ev­i­dence that the coun­try’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery from the virus-in­duced down­turn has been dra­matic.</p>
    <p>But j obs data re­leased by the Labour Depart­ment yes­ter­day showed that the US econ­omy added 1.4 mil­lion jobs in Au­gust, down from July’s 1.8 mil­lion and June’s record-smash­ing 4.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate last month, how­ever, fell much more than ex­pected to 8.4 per cent, com­pared with the 10.2 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will de­liver re­marks from his home base of Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware, af­ter his busiest cam­paign week in months.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has no pub­lic events planned.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has this week trav­elled to Pitts­burgh and Kenosha, Wisconsin, both in bat­tle­ground states that help de­cide the elec­tion, to ad­dress the on­go­ing protests over racial in­jus­tice and po­lice bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also vis­ited Kenosha – a flash­point city where anti-racist demon­stra­tors have clashed with his sup­port­ers af­ter the po­lice shoot­ing of a black man – and made stops in Penn­syl­va­nia and North Carolina, an­other key state.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent Reuters/Ip­sos poll showed that the race has re­mained rel­a­tively sta­ble over the last sev­eral weeks, with Mr Bi­den hold­ing a 7 per­cent­age point over Mr Trump na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, draw­ing a sharp con­trast with the Pres­i­dent, Mr Bi­den aligned him­self strongly and sym­pa­thet­i­cally with pro­test­ers of racial in­jus­tice and with black vot­ers dur­ing an af­ter­noon of raw in­ter­ac­tions with peo­ple still grap­pling with the po­lice shoot­ing of Mr Ja­cob Blake.</p>
    <p>Two days af­ter Mr Trump trav­elled to Kenosha to fo­cus at­ten­tion on street vi­o­lence and dis­or­der, Mr Bi­den sought to strike a dras­ti­cally dif­fer­ent tone, as he re­pu­di­ated the Pres­i­dent’s di­vi­sive ap­proach to mat­ters of racial in­jus­tice and civil un­rest and of­fered an al­ter­na­tive vi­sion fo­cused on na­tional unity.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den met Mr Blake’s fam­ily for about an hour af­ter land­ing in Wisconsin, and spoke with Mr Blake him­self on the phone.</p>
    <p>He stressed his com­mit­ment to cor­rect­ing decades of sys­temic racism, as he ac­knowl­edged racial dis­par­i­ties in health care, ed­u­ca­tion and the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Win or lose, I’m go­ing to go down fight­ing,” Mr Bi­den said as he de­scribed the pos­si­bil­ity of a more just fu­ture. “I’m go­ing to go down fight­ing for racial equal­ity, equity across the board.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent also took pains to warn against vi­o­lent</p>
    <p>ex­pres­sions of anger, re­gard­less of “how an­gry you are”.</p>
    <p>He lis­tened as a black lawyer dis­cussed racism in the le­gal sys­tem and a white store owner praised the close-knit city’s com­mu­nity spirit even as she de­scribed her busi­ness be­ing looted.</p>
    <p>The scene and sub­stance of the dis­cus­sion pro­vided a strik­ing con­trast to Mr Trump’s visit on Tues­day. The Pres­i­dent nei­ther met with the Blake fam­ily nor grap­pled with the sear­ing is­sues of po­lice bru­tal­ity and racism.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he met lo­cal law en­force­ment lead­ers and de­liv­ered a mes­sage of pro­test­ers run amok, and of “loot­ers” and “riot­ers” he said were cow­ing lib­eral politi­cians. He re­jected the idea of sys­temic racism while ex­press­ing em­pa­thy with po­lice of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>While law en­force­ment mem­bers were listed as par­tic­i­pants in the meet­ing, Mr Bi­den’s event did not fo­cus on the po­lice per­spec­tive in the way that Mr Trump’s trip did.</p>
    <p>He sought, in­stead, to un­der­score prom­ises that have an­i­mated his cam­paign from the be­gin­ning: That he can re­store ci­vil­ity and steadi­ness at a po­larised and perilous mo­ment for the na­tion, and that Mr Trump is an in­cen­di­ary fig­ure who es­ca­lates al­ready fraught sit­u­a­tions and em­bold­ens big­ots.</p>
    <p>“Not all his fault, but it le­git­imises a dark side of hu­man na­ture,” he said of Mr Trump’s mes­sag­ing.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Mr Joe Bi&#xAD;den speak&#xAD;ing at Grace Lutheran Church in Kenosha on Thurs&#xAD;day, in the af&#xAD;ter&#xAD;math of the po&#xAD;lice shoot&#xAD;ing of Mr Ja&#xAD;cob Blake. He met the Blake fam&#xAD;ily and his visit was a strik&#xAD;ing con&#xAD;trast to Pres&#xAD;i&#xAD;dent Don&#xAD;ald Trump&#x2019;s on Tues&#xAD;day. Mr Trump nei&#xAD;ther met with the Blake fam&#xAD;ily nor grap&#xAD;pled with the is&#xAD;sues of po&#xAD;lice bru&#xAD;tal&#xAD;ity and racism.</p>
