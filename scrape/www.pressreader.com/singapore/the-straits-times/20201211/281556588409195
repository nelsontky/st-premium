    <p>The com­pa­nies be­hind Cathay Cine­plexes and Golden Vil­lage have en­tered into an ini­tial agree­ment for a pos­si­ble merger that would cre­ate the largest cin­ema op­er­a­tor here. Golden Vil­lage owner, Or­ange Sky Golden Har­vest En­ter­tain­ment (Hold­ings), and mm2 Asia, which owns Cathay, also aim to bring in new in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies be­hind Cathay Cine­plexes and Golden Vil­lage have en­tered into an ini­tial agree­ment for a pos­si­ble merger that would cre­ate the largest cin­ema op­er­a­tor in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-listed mm2 Asia, which owns Cathay, and Golden Vil­lage owner Or­ange Sky Golden Har­vest En­ter­tain­ment (Hold­ings), or OSGH, aim to bring in new in­vestors to in­ject more cap­i­tal into the com­bined busi­ness as part of the deal.</p>
    <p>mm2 Asia owns eight cin­e­mas in Sin­ga­pore un­der the Cathay brand, and 14 cin­e­mas in Malaysia un­der the Cathay Cine­plexes Malaysia, Mega Cin­e­mas and Lo­tus Fives­tar la­bels. It also owns a movie film distributi­on busi­ness and an on­line stream­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>OSGH has 14 Golden Vil­lage cin­e­mas here. The Hong Kong-listed com­pany, pre­vi­ously known as Golden Har­vest, runs a to­tal of 35 cin­e­mas with 285 screens in Hong Kong, Tai­wan and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A merger of the two cin­ema busi­nesses would not only pro­vide economies of scale, but also give more fi­nan­cial and op­er­at­ing sta­bil­ity to mm2 Asia’s cin­ema busi­ness, given the chal­lenges faced by cin­ema op­er­a­tors since the Covid-19 out­break, mm2 Asia said in a fil­ing with the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change on Wed­nes­day evening.</p>
    <p>The movie and cin­ema busi­ness here has also faced dis­rup­tion with the ad­vent of con­tent stream­ing apps and the growth of video con­tent on so­cial me­dia, the com­pany noted. The merger would there­fore re­sult in a stronger plat­form for the op­er­a­tion of the cin­ema busi­ness, it said.</p>
    <p>The deal faces sev­eral reg­u­la­tory hur­dles, namely, ap­provals from both mm2 Asia and OSGH share­hold­ers, nods from SGX and the Hong Kong Ex­change, as well as the rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial agree­ment, known as a heads of agree­ment, will be ter­mi­nated if the terms of the de­fin­i­tive agree­ments can­not be agreed upon, or the con­di­tions of the pro­posed trans­ac­tion can­not be sat­is­fied, by Dec 3 next year.</p>
    <p>A week ago, mm2 Asia an­nounced a pos­si­ble spin-off and sep­a­rate list­ing of its cin­ema busi­ness on the Catal­ist board. That spin-off is be­ing pro­ceeded with in par­al­lel with the work on the pro­posed merger, the com­pany said in Wed­nes­day’s an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>In the event that the sep­a­rate list­ing is com­pleted suc­cess­fully, mm2 said the par­ties will dis­cuss in good faith the ba­sis on which the pro­posed merger and beef­ing-up of the com­bined busi­ness with new in­vestors would take place, tak­ing into ac­count the listed spinoff busi­ness.</p>
    <p>mm2 Asia also said the par­ties are still ne­go­ti­at­ing the fi­nan­cial terms, adding that the merger terms will be dis­cussed based on fi­nan­cial year 2019 op­er­at­ing fig­ures, sub­jected to mu­tu­ally agreed ad­just­ments.</p>
    <p>For the six months ended June 30, Golden Vil­lage’s Sin­ga­pore cin­ema busi­ness made a loss of HK$16.9 mil­lion (S$2.9 mil­lion) on rev­enue of just HK$137.4 mil­lion, due to cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, The Edge Sin­ga­pore re­ported.</p>
    <p>This com­pares with op­er­at­ing profit of HK$70.6 mil­lion and rev­enue of HK$401 mil­lion for the year-ago pe­riod.</p>
    <p>mm2 sank to a net loss of $22.4 mil­lion for the half-year to Sept 30, from a net profit of $9.18 mil­lion in the year-ago pe­riod. This comes as rev­enue fell by 83 per cent year on year to $19.9 mil­lion, hurt by safe-man­age­ment mea­sures that lim­ited op­er­a­tions in its core cin­ema and events busi­nesses.</p>
