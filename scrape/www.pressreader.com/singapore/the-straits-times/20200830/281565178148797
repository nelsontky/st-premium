    <p>In 2015, there was a mass out­break of 360 in­fec­tions caused by the Group B Strep­to­coc­cus (GBS) bac­terium.</p>
    <p>Two died from the in­fec­tion. About 160 of those in­fected had blood poi­son­ing caused by a much more in­fec­tious strain of the bac­te­ria – GBS ST283 – linked to the con­sump­tion of raw fresh­wa­ter fish.</p>
    <p>They suf­fered from fever, joint in­fec­tion and menin­gi­tis.</p>
    <p>A 50-year-old man lost all his limbs and an­other 54-year-old man fell into a two-week-long coma and lost his hearing.</p>
    <p>Tests con­ducted by the au­thor­i­ties on nearly 400 fish sam­ples con­cluded the strain was found in To­man fish, also known as snake­head fish; Song fish, also known as Asian big­head carp; and ti­lapia. The first two types are of­ten used in Chi­nese-style dishes with raw fish.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic health scare prompted the Govern­ment to ban food retail es­tab­lish­ments from sell­ing ready-to-eat raw fresh­wa­ter fish in De­cem­ber 2015. The bac­te­ria has not been found in salt­wa­ter fish.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tion rates dropped af­ter the ban, which is still in place.</p>
    <p>In July last year, re­searchers led by Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal and the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search found that the ST283 strain has caused dis­ease in peo­ple and fresh­wa­ter fish mainly in South-east Asia for over two decades, and is es­pe­cially ag­gres­sive.</p>
    <p>By analysing the DNA of bac­te­ria sam­ples col­lected from lo­cal hos­pi­tals dat­ing back to 1995 and re­gional data, re­searchers found that over 350 ST283 in­fec­tions have oc­curred in Laos, Thai­land, Viet­nam, Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. The ST283 strain is al­most com­pletely ab­sent else­where. In­fec­tions caused by it can be treated with an­tibi­otics such as peni­cillin.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Mr Tan Whee Boon, who was among those in&#xAD;fected by the Group B Strep&#xAD;to&#xAD;coc&#xAD;cus (GBS) bac&#xAD;terium in 2015, had to have his hands and feet am&#xAD;pu&#xAD;tated. The GBS ST283 strain is as&#xAD;so&#xAD;ci&#xAD;ated with the con&#xAD;sump&#xAD;tion of raw fresh&#xAD;wa&#xAD;ter fish.</p>
