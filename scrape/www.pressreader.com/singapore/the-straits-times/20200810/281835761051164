    <p>TAIPEI • A se­nior mem­ber of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion landed in Tai­wan yes­ter­day for Wash­ing­ton’s high­est-level visit since it switched diplo­matic recog­ni­tion to China in 1979, a move Bei­jing has con­demned.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the three-day trip, US Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar will meet Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen, an ad­vo­cate for the is­land be­ing recog­nised as a sov­er­eign na­tion, who is loathed by China’s lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar is the most se­nior Cab­i­net mem­ber to visit Tai­wan in decades and his trip comes as re­la­tions be­tween the world’s two big­gest eco­nomic pow­ers plunge to his­toric lows.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has billed the trip as an op­por­tu­nity to learn from Tai­wan’s fight against the coro­n­avirus and to cel­e­brate its pro­gres­sive val­ues. “This trip is a recog­ni­tion of Tai­wan’s success in com­bat­ing Covid-19 and a tes­ta­ment to the shared be­liefs that open and demo­cratic so­ci­eties are best equipped to com­bat­ing dis­ease threats like Covid-19,” a Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing last week de­scribed Mr Azar’s visit to Tai­wan as a threat to “peace and sta­bil­ity” while China’s de­fence min­is­ter warned against Wash­ing­ton mak­ing any “dan­ger­ous moves”.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar will also hold talks with his Tai­wanese coun­ter­part Chen Shih-chung and For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has be­come a poster child in the fight against Covid-19, thanks to the is­land’s strong con­tact trac­ing and firm bor­der con­trols.</p>
    <p>De­spite its prox­im­ity and eco­nomic links to China, it has recorded fewer than 500 in­fec­tions and seven deaths.</p>
    <p>The deteriorat­ing ties be­tween US and China come as Mr Trump seeks re-elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>As public dis­ap­proval grows over his han­dling of the epi­demic, he has piv­oted from his pre­vi­ous fo­cus on strik­ing a trade deal with China to blam­ing the coun­try for the global health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Trump, Wash­ing­ton’s ties with Taipei have warmed dra­mat­i­cally and he has ap­proved sev­eral ma­jor mil­i­tary sales, in­clud­ing F-16 fighter jets.</p>
    <p>Dr Dou­glas Paal, former head of the Amer­i­can In­sti­tute in Tai­wan, Wash­ing­ton’s de­facto em­bassy, said the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion was still pay­ing heed to China’s red line</p>
    <p>– that no US of­fi­cial han­dling na­tional se­cu­rity visit Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence this time, he said, is the con­text – with Mr Azar trav­el­ling at a time when Sino-US ties have hit a new bot­tom.</p>
    <p>“Send­ing him to Tai­wan shows re­spect for the old frame­work while putting a fin­ger in China’s eye at the same time,” Dr Paal said. “The fact that they didn’t choose to send a na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser or some­one else sug­gests they are try­ing to come as close as pos­si­ble to China’s red line but don’t want to cross it.”</p>
