    <p>LON­DON • Vladimir Ivic said on Satur­day after be­ing named man­ager of rel­e­gated Watford that he needs to adapt as fast as pos­si­ble to English foot­ball if he is to take them straight back to the Premier League.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old Ser­bian signed a one-year con­tract – with the op­tion of ex­tend­ing it by a fur­ther year – and will be the Hor­nets’ fourth full-time boss since last Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>His pre­de­ces­sor Nigel Pear­son was con­tro­ver­sially sacked last month with two English top-flight matches re­main­ing in the sea­son, with Hay­den Mullins, who had two stints as in­terim man­ager last term, fail­ing to keep them up.</p>
    <p>Watford started last sea­son with Javi Gracia but he was sacked after the club failed to win their open­ing four games.</p>
    <p>They reap­pointed for­mer man­ager Quique Sanchez Flores but he lasted less than three months.</p>
    <p>Rel­e­ga­tion ended a five-year stay in the top tier for last year’s FA Cup fi­nal­ists but Ivic hopes to take them back up at the first time of ask­ing – once he set­tles in.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Paok coach, who lifted the 2017 Greek Cup, and guided Mac­cabi Tel Aviv to suc­ces­sive Is­raeli league ti­tles in the past two sea­sons, told the club web­site: “First of all, from the be­gin­ning, I have a big ex­pec­ta­tion of my­self and of my coach­ing staff.</p>
    <p>“It’s my first time in Eng­land and I need to adapt as fast as pos­si­ble, to do the best for the club is very im­por­tant to me.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer Ser­bia in­ter­na­tional mid­fielder will start work at Vicarage Road to­day, along­side his three-strong coach­ing team.</p>
    <p>“I’ve worked with my coach­ing staff for three years, so I know that we will ask the most from our­selves so we can help the play­ers to achieve the club’s goals,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Cham­pi­onship sea­son is due to start on Sept 12.</p>
