    <p>Lo­cal in­vestors were in a more pos­i­tive mood yes­ter­day after Wall Street closed overnight on a firm note, but no one was throw­ing cau­tion to the wind.</p>
    <p>News that blue chips such as Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and United Over­seas Bank were work­ing to cap staff costs proved a sober­ing re­minder about the eco­nomic head­winds.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tain sen­ti­ment left the bench­mark Straits Times Index (STI) ahead by just 3.28 points, or 0.13 per cent, at 2,485.83.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries was the big­gest gainer among the STI com­po­nents, ris­ing 3.36 per cent to $1.23.</p>
    <p>It has en­joyed a steady re-rat­ing after sep­a­rat­ing it­self from its be­lea­guered off­shore and ma­rine arm Sem­b­corp Ma­rine (Sem­bmarine).</p>
    <p>Sem­bmarine, the day’s most heav­ily traded, fi­nally seemed to have found a floor after sev­eral days of plumb­ing new lows. It ended 0.62 per cent higher at 16.3 cents.</p>
    <p>Other sig­nif­i­cant STI gain­ers in­cluded Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, which rose 2.99 per cent to 69 cents, and Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust, up 2.22 per cent to $3.22.</p>
    <p>In the small-cap space, sub­sea engi­neer­ing and oil­field ser­vices com­pany IEV Hold­ings jumped 29.41 per cent to 4.4 cents. The firm said on Mon­day night that it plans to sell its main op­er­at­ing unit for $200,000. This will leave IEV with its health­care, post­par­tum care and well­ness busi­nesses ac­quired last year.</p>
    <p>Else­where, me­tal gifts man­u­fac­turer Joyas In­ter­na­tional saw a 50 per cent jump in its low-priced shares to 0.3 cent. The com­pany said last week that it plans to place out 300 mil­lion new shares at that price.</p>
    <p>Stock mar­kets around the re­gion were gen­er­ally firmer.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial mar­kets re­main op­ti­mistic a vac­cine will get done be­fore the year is over,” Oanda an­a­lyst Ed­ward Moya told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>In­vestors were hope­ful al­though the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Euro­pean chief, Dr Hans Kluge, sounded a sober note about the fight against the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong added 0.38 per cent, while China’s bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite Index rose 0.51 per cent.</p>
    <p>South Korea edged up 0.65 per cent, its high­est close since June 12, 2018, but Tokyo fell 0.44 per cent as in­vestors di­gested the im­pli­ca­tions of a new gov­ern­ment to be formed later this week.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian stocks slipped 0.1 per cent on a quiet day, with banks tak­ing a hit.</p>
    <p>A key high­light this week is the United States Fed­eral Re­serve pol­icy meet­ing, where the Fed is widely ex­pected to main­tain its dovish stance.</p>
