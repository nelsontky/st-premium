    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia Air­lines’ par­ent com­pany has sought fi­nan­cial aid from its sole share­holder, the na­tion’s sov­er­eign wealth fund, as debt restruc­tur­ing talks with cred­i­tors drag on, the com­pany said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia Avi­a­tion Group has re­quested fi­nan­cial sup­port from our share­holder Khaz­anah Na­sional although the com­pany isn’t in a po­si­tion to com­ment on amount at this point in time,” it said in an e-mail to Reuters.</p>
    <p>The group said it re­mains in talks for a restruc­tur­ing and that it was tar­get­ing a com­mer­cial agree­ment in the first week of next month.</p>
    <p>The air­line could be seek­ing as much as US$500 mil­lion (S$672 mil­lion), said Malaysia’s The Edge weekly, which first re­ported the news, cit­ing un­named sources.</p>
    <p>Khaz­anah said any fund­ing for the air­line will de­pend on the out­come of dis­cus­sions with cred­i­tors and lessors, which it said is cru­cial to the suc­cess of the restruc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Malaysia Air­lines is seek­ing to re­struc­ture af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic forced it to slash op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The par­ent com­pany had warned leas­ing com­pa­nies that Khaz­anah would stop fund­ing the group and force it into a wind­ing­down process if restruc­tur­ing talks with lessors were un­suc­cess­ful, Reuters re­ported last month.</p>
    <p>The car­rier re­struc­tured af­ter two deadly crashes in 2014, with Khaz­anah pump­ing in RM6 bil­lion (S$2 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>This time, the govern­ment has said it will not bail out the strug­gling com­pany.</p>
    <p>The air­line’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Izham Is­mail told staff in a memo last month that the restruc­tur­ing talks were tak­ing longer than planned.</p>
