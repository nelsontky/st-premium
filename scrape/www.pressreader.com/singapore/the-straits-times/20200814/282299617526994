    <p>Julie de Li­bran’s cur­ricu­lum vi­tae is chock-full of the most il­lus­tri­ous names in fash­ion.</p>
    <p>The French de­signer cut her teeth at Gior­gio Ar­mani, headed the celebrity-dress­ing di­vi­sion at Prada and ended up as Marc Ja­cobs’ right­hand wo­man at Louis Vuit­ton, di­rect­ing his wom­enswear stu­dio. When Ja­cobs left Vuit­ton, de Li­bran was re­cruited for the top job at So­nia Rykiel.</p>
    <p>In her five years at the brand from 2014 to 2019, she brought the one­time bea­con of lib­er­ated Left Bank cool back into the thick of the fash­ion con­ver­sa­tion, ad­ding a con­tem­po­rary edge to the So­nia Rykiel sig­na­tures of striped knits, ex­posed seam­ing and easy 1970s sil­hou­ettes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there was a ten­sion be­tween her­itage, cre­ative en­ergy and com­mer­cial vi­a­bil­ity that proved tricky to re­solve and the busi­ness side never seemed com­pletely aligned with her vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Sales suf­fered, de Li­bran left and, soon after, the much-loved brand filed for bank­ruptcy and liq­ui­dated its United States’ busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Dana Thomas of The New York Times in Septem­ber last year, de Li­bran said of her time at big brands: “I think of Louis Vuit­ton, where I was for six years, and then Rykiel; it’s about quan­tity and sell­ing, and you lose the knowl­edge and ap­pre­ci­a­tion. I learnt so much, but I’ve done that school. I can do it on my own now, prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>And what de Li­bran wants to do on her own is qui­etly rad­i­cal in its way.</p>
    <p>To­wards the end of her Rykiel ten­ure, she in­tro­duced a haute cou­ture col­lec­tion and started nudg­ing the brand to­wards sus­tain­able ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>It is these two tenets that form the core of the epony­mous brand she launched last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Pre­sented dur­ing haute cou­ture fash­ion week in an in­ti­mate show­case at her own home, de Li­bran looked to the cou­ture model by sell­ing her pieces made-to-or­der only to avoid over-pro­duc­tion and wastage.</p>
    <p>On the sus­tain­abil­ity side, she com­mit­ted to us­ing dead­stock fabrics. Due to the limited na­ture of her raw ma­te­ri­als, the re­sult­ing prod­ucts are sim­i­larly ex­clu­sive, with some pieces ex­ist­ing only as one-offs and oth­ers pro­duced in ex­tremely small runs.</p>
    <p>She has also adopted the prac­tice of do­ing one thing and do­ing it well.</p>
    <p>Her col­lec­tions con­sist only of dresses, a gar­ment she says “has a strong per­son­al­ity” and “re­flects how a wo­man feels and sees her­self”.</p>
    <p>Hers range from stream­lined sheaths and bil­lowy baby­dolls to fringed party num­bers and pail­let­ten-crusted god­dess gowns – giv­ing new mean­ing to the adage “dress for suc­cess”.</p>
