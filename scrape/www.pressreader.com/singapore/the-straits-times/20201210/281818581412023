    <p>•</p>
    <p>KATH­MANDU The high­est point on Earth just got a bit higher as China and Nepal fi­nally agreed on a pre­cise el­e­va­tion for Mount Ever­est af­ter years of de­bate.</p>
    <p>The agreed height of 8,848.86m – un­veiled at a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day i n Kath­mandu – was 86cm higher than the mea­sure­ment pre­vi­ously recog­nised by Nepal, and more than 4m above China’s of­fi­cial fig­ure.</p>
    <p>This dis­crep­ancy was due to China mea­sur­ing the rock base on the sum­mit and not – as with the new read­ing – the cov­er­ing of snow and ice on the peak.</p>
    <p>Ever­est strad­dles the bor­der of Nepal and China.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ing trigonomet­ry hun­dreds of kilo­me­tres away on the In­dian plains, Bri­tish colo­nial ge­og­ra­phers first deter­mined Ever­est’s height in 1856 at 8,840m above sea level.</p>
    <p>Af­ter New Zealan­der Ed­mund Hil­lary and Nepali Sherpa Ten­z­ing Nor­gay fa­mously first reached the sum­mit of Ever­est on May 29, 1953, an In­dian sur­vey read­justed the al­ti­tude to 8,848m.</p>
    <p>That mea­sure­ment was widely ac­cepted, with the num­ber ap­peal­ing not only to am­bi­tious moun­taineers, but also in­spir­ing names for ad­ven­ture cloth­ing lines, restau­rants and even a vodka brand.</p>
    <p>In 1999, the US Na­tional Geo­graphic So­ci­ety con­cluded the world’s high­est point was 8,850m, but Nepal never of­fi­cially recog­nised this, although it is widely quoted.</p>
    <p>China, mean­while, con­ducted sev­eral sur­veys of its own, and in 2005 came up with a mea­sure­ment of 8,844.43m.</p>
    <p>That pro­voked a row with Nepal, which was re­solved only in 2010 when Kath­mandu and Bei­jing agreed that their mea­sure­ments re</p>
    <p>ferred to dif­fer­ent things – one to the height of Ever­est’s rock and the other to the height of its snow­cap.</p>
    <p>Nepal de­cided to con­duct a sur­vey – ini­tially alone and later joined by China – af­ter sug­ges­tions that tec­tonic plate move</p>
    <p>ments in­clud­ing a ma­jor earth­quake in 2015 may have af­fected the height.</p>
    <p>About 300 Nepali ex­perts and sur­vey­ors were in­volved in the ex­er­cise – some on foot and oth­ers in he­li­copters – to reach data col­lec­tion sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dang Yamin of the Na­tional Bu­reau of Sur­vey­ing and Map­ping told Chi­nese state broad­caster CCTV that the fi­nal re­sult was an av­er­age value be­tween the mea­sure­ments by Nepal and China, in ac­cor­dance with sci­en­tific rules.</p>
    <p>Nepal’s Land Min­is­ter Padma Ku­mari Aryal said: “Var­i­ous coun­tries have com­pleted the mea­sure­ment of the height... sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>“The re­sults have been dif­fer­ent on dif­fer­ent oc­ca­sions, so to­day we end these spec­u­la­tions.”</p>
