    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia will not reim­pose wide­spread coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions on travel de­spite a re­cent spike in in­fec­tions, which a gov­ern­ment min­is­ter said was partly caused by mi­grants from neigh­bour­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Malaysia im­posed a na­tion­wide move­ment curb in March but has been grad­u­ally lift­ing the re­stric­tions, though the au­thor­i­ties have warned that they could be re­in­stated if daily in­creases in in­fec­tions reached triple dig­its.</p>
    <p>The South-east Asian coun­try has seen a steady climb in cases in the past week and yes­ter­day re­ported 317 new i nfec­tions, the high­est daily rise since it be­gan track­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But Se­cu­rity Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said the gov­ern­ment did not see the need to reim­pose the lock­down as the ma­jor­ity of cases were be­ing re­ported in de­ten­tion cen­tres and iso­lated dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>“There’s only one or two cases in each state so it’s not some­thing that’s wor­ry­ing at this point,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin also said yes­ter­day that the coun­try is com­mit­ted to con­tain the spread of the virus as soon as pos­si­ble. He as­sured the pub­lic that the sit­u­a­tion is still un­der con­trol and that it is be­ing man­aged well by the rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has come un­der crit­i­cism for the in­crease in cases, many of which have been in or linked to the sec­ond-largest state of Sabah, on Bor­neo is­land, which held an elec­tion last month.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral politi­cians have been ac­cused of vi­o­lat­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing pro­to­cols on the cam­paign trail, while the au­thor­i­ties were crit­i­cised for not im­pos­ing con­trol mea­sures such as a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine for trav­ellers from Sabah.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail said the Sabah out­break stemmed from the il­le­gal en­try of mi­grants. The gov­ern­ment would in­crease re­sources and per­son­nel to guard the state’s bor­ders, he said.</p>
    <p>“The cases in neigh­bour­ing coun­tries have gone up and the en­try of il­le­gal mi­grants from there has im­pacted our ef­forts to con­trol the spread of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia has avoided the level of out­breaks seen in neigh­bours the Philip­pines and In­done­sia, which have 319,330 and 299,506 cases re­spec­tively. To date, Malaysia has re­ported a to­tal of 12,088 in­fec­tions, with 137 deaths.</p>
