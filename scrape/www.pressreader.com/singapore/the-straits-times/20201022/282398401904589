    <p>Film fes­ti­vals around the world go­ing vir­tual has not de­terred Sin­ga­porean film-mak­ers from par­tic­i­pat­ing and win­ning recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>Among them is direc­tor Tan Bee Thiam, 42. His com­edy, Tiong Bahru So­cial Club, has been picked to make its world pre­miere at one of Asia’s most im­por­tant film events, the Busan In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val in South Korea.</p>
    <p>The film, Tan’s first full-length fea­ture, has been se­lected to screen in the Win­dow On Asian Cin­ema sec­tion at the fes­ti­val, which opened yes­ter­day and runs till Oct 30. It is the only Sin­ga­pore movie screen­ing there this year. Past Sin­ga­pore en­trants in­clude Eric Khoo’s hor­ror satire Mee Pok Man (1995) and the SG50 an­thol­ogy 7 Let­ters (2015).</p>
    <p>The com­edy will open in cin­e­mas here on Dec 10.</p>
    <p>With travel pro­hi­bi­tions in place, the team be­hind the movie will not travel to Busan, or to Tai­wan, where the film has also been picked to screen at the Taipei Golden Horse Film Fes­ti­val, which takes place from Nov 5 to 22.</p>
    <p>Pro­ducer Huang Junx­i­ang, 31, tells The Straits Times in an e-mail in­ter­view that the team would have loved to travel, “meet­ing film-mak­ers around the world, show­cas­ing a film that rep­re­sents the joy­ful side of Sin­ga­pore cin­ema to a global au­di­ence”.</p>
    <p>The satir­i­cal movie, writ­ten by Tan and Antti Toivo­nen, tells the story of Ah Bee, a man who breaks the monotony of his life by join­ing the club of the film’s ti­tle, a cult­like place that seeks to in­crease the hap­pi­ness of mem­bers through al­go­rithms.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the film’s ideas, Tan says that “in Sin­ga­pore, the world’s most com­pet­i­tive na­tion, it is only nat­u­ral that we take hap­pi­ness and creativ­ity very se­ri­ously”.</p>
    <p>Co-writer and co-pro­ducer Toivo­nen, 42, a Finn based in Sin­ga­pore, points out: “You don’t need to know much about Sin­ga­pore or Tiong Bahru to ap­pre­ci­ate the film.</p>
    <p>“The story is writ­ten by a Finn and a Sin­ga­porean, so it’s an odd mix of Nordic and South-east Asian sen­si­bil­i­ties. I bet the film will stand out in a pos­i­tive way and stick with the view­ers.”</p>
    <p>Another film by a Sin­ga­porean that will get a world pre­miere at a ma­jor fes­ti­val is Light Of A Burn­ing Moth by writer-direc­tor Liao Jiekai. The Ja­panese-lan­guage drama will be screened at the Tokyo In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val (TIFF), which runs from Oct 31 to Nov 9.</p>
    <p>The film, Liao’s third fea­ture, “is a work that defies genre cat­e­gori­sa­tion”, says the 35-year-old via e-mail from Tokyo.</p>
    <p>In March, he grad­u­ated from the Tokyo Uni­ver­sity of the Arts, where he ob­tained a master’s de­gree in film di­rect­ing. The movie was pro­duced by the school as his grad­u­a­tion the­sis.</p>
    <p>The story de­tails a con­ver­sa­tion be­tween two fic­tional artists, one played by dancer Ha Young Mi and the other by mime artist Arai Han, as they deal with is­sues both creative and per­sonal.</p>
    <p>“It is cer­tainly a more vi­su­al­ly­driven film as op­posed to it be­ing story-driven or even char­ac­ter­driven, and be­cause of that, I will en­cour­age au­di­ences to watch it on the big screen,” says Liao, who plans to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore next month.</p>
    <p>He has lived in Ja­pan over var­i­ous pe­ri­ods – for work and study – and has with TIFF what he calls “a re­la­tion­ship that has grown in trust and fa­mil­iar­ity”. His pre­vi­ous two fea­tures, the dra­mas Red Dragon­flies (2010) and As You Were (2014), were screened at the fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>“It does feel like a home­com­ing each time my film is se­lected for TIFF,” he says, adding that he hopes it can be re­leased in Sin­ga­pore next year.</p>
    <p>Food, re­li­gion and cul­ture clashes oc­cur in the ro­man­tic com­edy Not My Mother’s Bak­ing, which re­lates what hap­pens when the daugh­ter of a Malay-Mus­lim celebrity chef falls in love with the son of a Chi­nese roast pork seller.</p>
    <p>The film by writer-direc­tor Remi M. Sali has been se­lected to screen at Five Flavours Asian Film Fes­ti­val in War­saw, Poland, which runs from Nov 25 to Dec 6. No Sin­ga­pore re­lease date has been set.</p>
    <p>Remi, 45, who has been mak­ing shows for broad­caster Me­di­a­corp and in­de­pen­dently for two decades, says in his direc­tor’s state­ment that the film “is a love note ad­dress­ing sen­si­tiv­i­ties per­tain­ing to race and re­li­gion in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>He adds that the in­de­pen­dent pro­duc­tion boasts a num­ber of Sin­ga­pore film firsts, among them the por­trayal of an English­s­peak­ing Malay fam­ily as lead char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Real mother-and-daugh­ter celebrity chefs Siti Mas­tura Alwi and Sarah Arif­fin play them­selves, joined by real fa­ther-and-son ac­tors Zack Zainal and Ben­jamin Zainal. It also stars veteran lo­cal ac­tor Vin­cent Tee.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Ho Pak Kin, 52, says in an e-mail in­ter­view: “We hope the movie will en­cour­age dis­cus­sion, re­spect and un­der­stand­ing be­tween com­mu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“For the first time, an English­s­peak­ing Malay fam­ily takes cen­tre stage, with a fluid switch to Ba­hasa Me­layu when it fits the scene. The movie is nar­rated in Man­darin, with the story told from the Chi­nese fam­ily’s per­spec­tive.”</p>
