    <p>China’s closely watched fifth plenum of the Communist Party’s cur­rent cen­tral com­mit­tee last week was sig­nif­i­cant not just for the new plan that will chart the course of the coun­try’s eco­nomic and so­cial developmen­t over the next five years. It also gave a vi­sion of where the world’s sec­ond-largest economy wants to be 15 years from now in 2035, some­thing that was last done in 1995. This be­ing the sec­ond term of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, and with his two im­me­di­ate pre­de­ces­sors hav­ing served only two terms, the fifth ple­nary ses­sion should also have con­firmed his suc­ces­sor. The fifth plenum of the 17th cen­tral com­mit­tee in 2010 had con­firmed him as then Pres­i­dent Hu Jin­tao’s suc­ces­sor by mak­ing him vicechair­man of the Cen­tral Mil­i­tary Com­mis­sion. No such move was made last week, giv­ing cre­dence to the view that Mr Xi in­tends to stay on as leader of the party and state when his cur­rent terms of of­fice for both end in 2022 and 2023 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>But the cen­tre­piece of this plenum was the 14th Five-Year Na­tional Eco­nomic and So­cial Developmen­t Plan, to­gether with the 2035 Long-Term Goals. While the full text was just pub­lished on Tues­day and has yet to be dis­sected, what came out in the com­mu­nique gave much food for thought. First off, while there was no growth tar­get given, there’s the hint of one in the ex­pressed goal of rais­ing per capita gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) to match the level of mod­er­ately de­vel­oped coun­tries by 2035. This would re­quire the dou­bling of per capita GDP – which sur­passed US$10,000 (S$13,600) last year – to US$20,000 in 2035, which means pur­su­ing high growth is still im­por­tant. Some economists project an an­nual growth tar­get range of 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent for the next five years.</p>
    <p>The new eco­nomic strat­egy of “dual cir­cu­la­tion” that fo­cuses on in­creas­ing re­liance on do­mes­tic de­mand and re­duc­ing eco­nomic de­pen­dence on the rest of the world is very much in play in this new plan. This comes as the world economy is hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic and as coun­tries seek to di­ver­sify sup­ply chains away from China. Also, in re­sponse to the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment – specif­i­cally its tech war with the United States – China is plac­ing em­pha­sis on self­suf­fi­ciency in tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>But the com­mu­nique also shows that China sees a wan­ing of the US’ in­flu­ence in the world and an op­por­tu­nity for it to ex­pand its own. It notes a “pro­found ad­just­ment in the in­ter­na­tional bal­ance of power”, which can be read as a re­in­force­ment of the nar­ra­tive that China’s com­pos­ite na­tional power is ris­ing while the US con­tin­ues to de­te­ri­o­rate in power and stand­ing. The com­mu­nique also states that China should par­tic­i­pate ac­tively in re­forms to the global gov­er­nance sys­tem. What this sug­gests is that the world should be pre­pared to see a more as­sured and as­sertive China on the global stage.</p>
