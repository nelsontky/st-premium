    <p>An en­gi­neer who failed in his duty to check the plans and per­form cal­cu­la­tions for key sup­port struc­tures used in the con­struc­tion of a Pan-Is­land Expressway (PIE) viaduct lost his ap­peal against a six-month jail term yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In his ap­peal for a fine, Leong Sow Hon, 62, sub­mit­ted an ex­pert’s re­port that stated the er­rors in the plans he ap­proved would have been picked up by oth­ers prior to any col­lapse.</p>
    <p>High Court judge Aedit Ab­dul­lah re­jected the ar­gu­ment. He pointed to the 2004 Ni­coll High­way col­lapse, say­ing it oc­curred de­spite there hav­ing been warn­ing signs be­cause those signs had not been picked up by all the par­ties in­volved.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Aedit said: “An im­por­tant fac­tor in the leg­isla­tive frame­work of safety laws is to en­sure that each and ev­ery step is in­deed taken to pro­tect safety, so that a per­fect storm of er­rors is avoided.</p>
    <p>“Ar­gu­ing that oth­ers would have picked up on prob­lems one is sup­posed to have ad­dressed one­self can­not be a ba­sis for re­duc­ing the harm en­gen­dered on the facts.”</p>
    <p>Leong was the ac­cred­ited checker for the con­struc­tion of the 1.8km-long viaduct from the Tampines Expressway to the PIE and Up­per Changi Road East.</p>
    <p>Un­der build­ing reg­u­la­tions, his duty was to eval­u­ate the plans to deter­mine if “key struc­tural el­e­ments” such as foun­da­tions and col­umns are ad­e­quate.</p>
    <p>On July 14, 2017, tem­po­rary struc­tures at part of the viaduct gave way, caus­ing the death of one worker and in­jur­ing 10 oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the col­lapse, which did not im­pli­cate Leong, the cal­cu­la­tions for the whole struc­ture were checked.</p>
    <p>An in­ves­ti­ga­tion found that eight sup­port struc­tures known as per­ma­nent cor­bels were in­ad­e­quately de­signed: five would have col­lapsed dur­ing the con­struc­tion stage and three would have col­lapsed un­der a full traf­fic load.</p>
    <p>Leong ini­tially lied that he had done the cal­cu­la­tions and checked the plans but con­fessed two months later, af­ter he was un­able to pro­vide ev­i­dence of the cal­cu­la­tions.</p>
    <p>He was among five peo­ple charged over the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>In June last year, he pleaded guilty to a charge un­der the Build­ing Con­trol Act for fail­ing to check the struc­tural plans and per­form cal­cu­la­tions.</p>
    <p>One count of falsely cer­ti­fy­ing he had car­ried out the re­quired checks was con­sid­ered when a district judge sen­tenced him to six months’ jail.</p>
    <p>Leong ap­pealed, ar­gu­ing that the sen­tence was ex­ces­sive.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Jus­tice Aedit said six months’ jail was “on the con­sid­er­ably shorter side” af­ter set­ting out a sen­tenc­ing frame­work for such of­fences, which carry a fine of up to $100,000 and a max­i­mum jail of two years.</p>
    <p>The frame­work con­sists of a ma­trix to deter­mine an in­dica­tive start­ing point based on the level of harm and the level of cul­pa­bil­ity of the of­fence. The start­ing point is then ad­justed ac­cord­ing to fac­tors spe­cific to the of­fender.</p>
    <p>In Leong’s case, the judge found the level of cul­pa­bil­ity was medium be­cause he failed to per­form in­de­pen­dent cal­cu­la­tions and failed to check the work of his sub­or­di­nates. The harm cre­ated by Leong’s of­fences was high, said the judge.</p>
    <p>“The po­ten­tial harm en­gen­dered in­cluded not only po­ten­tial death or in­jury to per­sons, but also po­ten­tial dam­age to essen­tial public in­fra­struc­ture,” he added.</p>
