    <p>SYD­NEY Cricket Aus­tralia (CA) yes­ter­day apol­o­gised to the In­dia team after vis­it­ing play­ers al­leged they had been racially abused by part of the crowd dur­ing the third Test at Syd­ney Cricket Ground.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports said In­dia cap­tain Ajinkya Ra­hane spoke to the um­pires at the end of the third day’s play on Satur­day fol­low­ing complaints by Jasprit Bum­rah and Mo­hammed Si­raj that they had heard racist slurs while field­ing near the bound­ary rope.</p>
    <p>The Times of In­dia news­pa­per re­ported that drunk fans had called Bum­rah and Si­raj “mon­keys, w***** and m*****f*****”.</p>
    <p>The un­ruli­ness con­tin­ued yes­ter­day, as six peo­ple were ejected while play was halted for nearly 10 min­utes just be­fore the tea break.</p>
    <p>Si­raj ran from the fine leg bound­ary to­wards the um­pires, point­ing at the crowd and although it was not im­me­di­ately clear what had been said, lo­cal po­lice were seen re­mov­ing six men from their seats.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, CA con­demned all “dis­crim­i­na­tory be­hav­iour” and said that it would act against any­one found guilty of vil­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“As se­ries hosts, we un­re­servedly apol­o­gise to our friends in the In­dian cricket team and as­sure them we will pros­e­cute the mat­ter to its fullest ex­tent,” head of in­tegrity and se­cu­rity Sean Car­roll said. “Once those re­spon­si­ble are iden­ti­fied, CA will take the strong­est mea­sures pos­si­ble un­der our anti-ha­rass­ment code, in­clud­ing lengthy bans, fur­ther sanc­tions and re­fer­ral to (the) po­lice.”</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Cricket Coun­cil (ICC) has since launched a probe and ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ing body’s anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion pol­icy, it falls on CA to in­ves­ti­gate the in­ci­dent and sub­mit a re­port within two weeks.</p>
    <p>A man was banned from at­tend­ing cricket matches in New Zealand for two years after be­ing found guilty of abus­ing Eng­land fast bowler Jofra Archer in 2019.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian great Shane Warne called the crowd be­hav­iour on Satur­day shame­ful.</p>
    <p>“Dis­grace­ful to be hon­est, ab­so­lutely dis­grace­ful,” he said while com­men­tat­ing on the match. “Let’s hope they come down heavy and find the cul­prits.”</p>
    <p>Only 10,000 fans – less than a quar­ter ca­pac­ity – are al­lowed each day due to Covid-19 con­cerns, mak­ing their chants more clearly heard. In­dia are 98 for two and need an­other 309 runs to win, with the four-match se­ries locked at 1-1.</p>
