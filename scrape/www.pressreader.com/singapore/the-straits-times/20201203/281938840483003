    <p>Amid the hand-wring­ing about what a Joe Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion in the United States could mean to the Amer­i­can pos­ture in East Asia, here’s some­thing of equal im­por­tance un­spool­ing in another cor­ner of the con­ti­nent that could, at some point, tail back to us: last week’s mur­der of Iran’s top nu­clear sci­en­tist and the fall­out from US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s end-of-term moves to­wards that na­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Mohsen Fakhrizade­h was nailed as he trav­elled with his wife to a hol­i­day re­sort pop­u­lar with high-rank­ing of­fi­cials. The as­sas­si­na­tion – if Iran were a demo­cratic na­tion, it would surely be called a ter­ror­ist strike – was car­ried out with tac­ti­cal bril­liance, an act that clearly re­quired weeks of plan­ning and lo­gis­tics co­or­di­na­tion be­tween in­tel­li­gence gath­er­ers and agents on the ground.</p>
    <p>Is­rael is be­lieved to have or­gan­ised the hit. It is dif­fi­cult to be­lieve that the US, given the tight­ness of its se­cu­rity ties and col­lab­o­ra­tion with Tel Aviv, was not at least broadly aware of the plot, if not its tim­ing.</p>
    <p>Te­heran has been left look­ing weak and in­ca­pable of de­fend­ing its best af­ter a series of strikes and in­tel­li­gence coups against its key nu­clear and hu­man as­sets in re­cent times.</p>
    <p>What’s go­ing on?</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dis­tinct threads are con­verg­ing here.</p>
    <p>To be­gin with, much of West</p>
    <p>Asia is unset­tled by the prospect of a strong Iran. Rulers from next-door United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) to slightly more dis­tant Saudi Ara­bia look askance at the self-styled “revo­lu­tion­ary regime” in Te­heran as a con­tin­u­ously desta­bil­is­ing force by de­sign.</p>
    <p>If Iran were a democ­racy, sub­ject to the usual tugs and pres­sures in­ter­nally and ex­ter­nally, or even a monar­chy, the re­gion would breathe eas­ier.</p>
    <p>It is not. In­stead, with a deep sense of its own civil­i­sa­tional his­tory – fac­tors that in some ways draw it men­tally closer to Asian gi­ants China and In­dia – it has a world view and a vi­sion about its due place in its neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>For those Sunni-ma­jor­ity states whose in­ter­ests nec­es­sar­ily col­lide with mostly Shi’ite Iran’s, the price of their own regimes’ sta­bil­ity is the need to toe the Amer­i­can line; cur­rently, that de­mands, among other things, nor­mal­is­ing re­la­tions with the Jewish state of Is­rael.</p>
    <p>These de­vel­op­ments, and the con­tin­u­ing ten­sion over Iran – the US Act­ing De­fence Sec­re­tary has just been in West Asia – mat­ter to the rest of us in the east­ern span of the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Ever since nav­i­ga­tors learnt about the mon­soon winds and how to use them, the West Asian re­gion has been civil­i­sa­tion­ally tied to our own. Now, strate­gi­cally as well.</p>
    <p>The birth of Opec in 1960 and its weapon­i­sa­tion with the oil em­bargo its Arab mem­bers placed on the US dur­ing the Arab-Is­raeli War of 1973 and then quadru­pled prices, be­gat a shift of eco­nomic power to oil-pro­duc­ing states be­fore the East Asian eco­nomic mir­a­cle took birth.</p>
    <p>The new-found pros­per­ity added mus­cle to Gulf states, which be­came a draw for mil­lions of Asians seek­ing gain­ful em­ploy­ment while Western na­tions suc­cess­fully sought lu­cra­tive con­tracts in ev­ery­thing from in­fra­struc­ture to de­fence.</p>
    <p>In his 24 years as Saudi oil min­is­ter un­til 1986, ev­ery word ut­tered by Har­vard-ed­u­cated Ahmed Zaki Yamani res­onated around the world.</p>
    <p>In­deed, as a his­tor­i­cal com­par­i­son, Sheikh Yamani’s in­flu­ence ex­ceeded that of the Ja­panese economist and fi­nance vice-min­is­ter Eisuke Sakak­ibara, who was known in a later era as</p>
    <p>“Mr Yen” for his ac­tive in­ter­ven­tion to pre­vent a strong yen.</p>
    <p>To­day, global geopo­lit­i­cal winds are shift­ing, and so are the sands in the Ara­bian desert.</p>
    <p>Washington, it­self en­ergy self-suf­fi­cient, sees the re­gion as in­trin­si­cally less im­por­tant than the Pa­cific theatre. At the same time, some of the same rea­sons that make it look at Asia over the Pa­cific rather than the At­lantic con­tinue to keep West Asia rel­e­vant to it.</p>
    <p>THE CHINA FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>China, which sup­planted Ja­pan as the world’s No. 2 econ­omy a decade ago, is the big­gest cus­tomer of West Asian oil.</p>
    <p>Con­trol­ling the for­tunes of the re­gion there­fore in­creases Washington’s abil­ity to pres­sure Bei­jing at the source of its en­ergy sup­ply. It par­al­lels at­tempts to build choke points along the sup­ply routes to the main­land.</p>
    <p>Thus, while most of us in South-east Asia are fix­ated on the power play in our South China Sea back­yard and per­haps even the tense Sino-In­dian bor­der, the Gulf is equally ac­tion sta­tions for geopo­lit­i­cal con­test.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the Arab world is just as leery of be­ing drawn too tightly into all this.</p>
    <p>Still, while there is some hedg­ing, the over­whelm­ing in­stinct is to stay on the right side of the US and its al­lies. China isn’t yet able to project power that far.</p>
    <p>This is af­fect­ing the re­gional se­cu­rity cal­cu­lus.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, New Delhi is ac­knowl­edged to have played a deft hand in West Asia by of­fer­ing its rul­ing elite ac­cess to its vast and lu­cra­tive mar­ket as well as pitch­ing it­self as a fu­ture se­cu­rity guar­an­tor as a key mem­ber of the Quadri­lat­eral Di­a­logue, a group that also in­cludes the US, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia that some see as a po­ten­tial Asian Nato.</p>
    <p>West of Sin­ga­pore, In­dia is to­day Amer­ica’s most im­por­tant non-treaty ally.</p>
    <p>It is note­wor­thy that this year’s Ex­er­cise Mal­abar, the an­nual mar­itime war games hosted by In­dia along with the US and Ja­panese navies, also in­cluded Aus­tralia, mak­ing it a mil­i­tary ex­ten­sion of the Quad.</p>
    <p>Equally sig­nif­i­cantly, it was a two-part ex­er­cise con­ducted in both the Bay of Ben­gal con­nect­ing South-east Asia and the Ara­bian Sea fac­ing West Asia.</p>
    <p>Ef­fec­tively, this ex­pands the Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion be­yond the “Hol­ly­wood to Bol­ly­wood, and from pen­guins to po­lar bears” one enun­ci­ated by for­mer US sec­re­tary of de­fence James Mat­tis.</p>
    <p>PAK­ISTAN’S PAIN</p>
    <p>Arab and Per­sian alike are ad­just­ing to the new real­i­ties. One re­la­tion­ship feel­ing the pain from the ad­just­ments is that be­tween the UAE and Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>Last month, com­men­tary in Pak­istani news­pa­pers re­flected dis­may and out­rage at the UAE’s de­ci­sion to list it among a dozen na­tions placed un­der new visa curbs.</p>
    <p>Last year, the Pak­istani es­tab­lish­ment was in­censed by host Abu Dhabi’s de­ci­sion to in­vite the In­dian for­eign min­is­ter to ad­dress the in­au­gu­ral ple­nary of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Is­lamic Co­op­er­a­tion (OIC) for­eign min­is­ters’ meet­ing as a “guest of hon­our”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Saudi Ara­bia, an­gered by Pak­istan’s crit­i­cism of it for not back­ing Is­lam­abad’s push to con­demn In­dia over Kash­mir, abruptly de­manded that it pay back US$1 bil­lion (S$1.34 bil­lion) in soft loans meant to tide it over a fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing quickly stepped in, ar­rang­ing the cash in a mere eight hours, ac­cord­ing to Pak­istani diplo­matic sources.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan is the cen­tre­piece of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive that seeks to ce­ment China’s in­flu­ence in the Eurasian land mass.</p>
    <p>The US has been sen­si­tive to any at­tempts by China to ex­pand its in­flu­ence in West Asia even as, for now, Bei­jing has shown only lim­ited in­ter­est in that di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Last De­cem­ber, af­ter Rus­sia, China and Iran launched their first joint naval ex­er­cises in the Gulf of Oman, the US State De­part­ment warned that Iran should “think twice” about con­duct­ing joint naval ex­er­cises, adding that such ac­tions “should con­cern all na­tions with an in­ter­est in safe­guard­ing free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion in the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>Iran pro­jected the in­au­gu­ral ex­er­cise, which was con­ducted in a low-key man­ner, as a strate­gic vic­tory, but days later, the US added men­ace to its words with a drone strike that killed Ira­nian Major-Gen­eral Qasem Soleimani, who headed the divi­sion lead­ing over­seas clan­des­tine mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>FALL­OUT FEARS</p>
    <p>For these rea­sons and more, East Asia will be watch­ing the events around Iran closely. The im­me­di­ate con­cern is whether</p>
    <p>Iran will fall for the US-Is­raeli bait and be tempted to or­der strikes that could then fetch a puni­tive re­sponse from Washington.</p>
    <p>Were that to hap­pen, the Ira­ni­ans will al­most cer­tainly make neigh­bours like the UAE suf­fer. Another that will suf­fer is Saudi Ara­bia, which last year felt the sting of mis­sile strikes on crit­i­cal oil fa­cil­i­ties be­lieved to have been or­ches­trated by Iran.</p>
    <p>West Asian politics spilt over into South-east Asia last De­cem­ber when only 20 of the 57 mem­bers of the OIC showed up at a sum­mit hosted in Kuala Lumpur by then Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad to dis­cuss geopo­lit­i­cal is­sues fac­ing the Mus­lim world.</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s ini­tia­tive an­gered sev­eral Arab states who saw in it an at­tempt to es­tab­lish a mini-OIC with more in­flu­ence for Turkey and Qatar, na­tions whose more ac­com­mo­dat­ing ap­proach to the Mus­lim Broth­er­hood move­ment riles them no end.</p>
    <p>Those ab­sent in­cluded Saudi Ara­bia, the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria and Jor­dan.</p>
    <p>Even if the West Asian re­gion es­capes armed con­flict be­fore Mr Trump ex­its, what lies ahead is not clear.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, close at­ten­tion will be paid to whether Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den’s taste for re-en­gag­ing with Te­heran and re­viv­ing the nu­clear agree­ment with Iran the US signed when he was vice-pres­i­dent will cost him po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal that may have an im­pact on his at­ten­tion to the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>The Gulf economies hadn’t yet re­cov­ered fully from the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis when Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>An out­break of war, how­ever brief, will dev­as­tate them fur­ther and af­fect liveli­hoods in an arc stretch­ing from the Philip­pines to In­done­sia and the In­dian sub-con­ti­nent. Mil­lions de­pend on re­mit­tances from rel­a­tives work­ing in the Gulf.</p>
    <p>As long as the ten­sions around Iran are seen as some­thing tak­ing</p>
    <p>When it’s OK not to be OK at the work­place</p>
    <p>place within the Mus­lim uni­verse, the rest of Asia may not be vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if, like the re­cent is­sues in France, they take on a global di­men­sion or are per­ceived as a Western at­tempt to sub­due a proud Mus­lim na­tion, the re­gion must step up its watch against the in­evitable sense of vic­tim­hood.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia is rid­dled with sleeper cells of a va­ri­ety of in­sur­gent groups. A key el­e­ment of mil­i­tant Shi’ite doc­trine is that its fighters may try to pass off as Sun­nis. Be­sides, ev­ery South-east Asian na­tion is wary of self-rad­i­calised Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>The US and Is­rael need to be care­ful that they do not trade a rea­son­ably sta­ble ad­ver­sary for a rash of lu­natics world­wide more dif­fi­cult to con­trol. That was the les­son from desta­bil­is­ing Iraq and top­pling Sad­dam Hus­sein.</p>
