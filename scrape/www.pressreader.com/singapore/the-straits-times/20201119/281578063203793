    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­nounced that he has fired Mr Christo­pher Krebs (right), di­rec­tor of the Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency (Cisa), who has pub­licly con­tra­dicted Mr Trump’s un­founded claims about wide­spread elec­tion fraud. Mr Krebs drew the ire of Mr Trump after Cisa de­clared that the Nov 3 elec­tion was “the most se­cure in Amer­i­can his­tory”.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­nounced he had fired a Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity of­fi­cial who has pub­licly con­tra­dicted his un­founded claims about wide­spread elec­tion fraud.</p>
    <p>Mr Christo­pher Krebs, a for­mer Mi­crosoft ex­ec­u­tive, was nom­i­nated by Mr Trump to a top cy­ber se­cu­rity job in 2018 and be­came the first di­rec­tor of the Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency, called Cisa, later that year.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump also sig­nalled that he in­tends to nom­i­nate the act­ing Comp­trol­ler of the Cur­rency to a new five-year term, po­ten­tially com­pli­cat­ing plans that the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion has to im­pose tougher reg­u­la­tions on Wall Street banks.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, the White House said it in­tends to sub­mit Mr Brian Brooks’ name to the Se­nate for con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Krebs drew the ire of Mr Trump after Cisa de­clared that the Nov 3 elec­tion was “the most se­cure in Amer­i­can his­tory”.</p>
    <p>In a tweet on Tues­day evening, Mr Trump said he was fin­ished with Mr Krebs.</p>
    <p>“The re­cent state­ment by Chris Krebs on the se­cu­rity of the 2020 Elec­tion was highly in­ac­cu­rate, in that there were mas­sive im­pro­pri­eties and fraud – in­clud­ing dead peo­ple vot­ing, Poll Watch­ers not al­lowed into polling lo­ca­tions, ‘glitches’ in the vot­ing ma­chines which changed votes from Trump to Bi­den, late vot­ing and many more,” Mr Trump tweeted, adding that he was ter­mi­nat­ing Mr Krebs “ef­fec­tive im­me­di­ately”.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the elec­tion re­sults were known, Mr Trump had cast doubt on the in­tegrity of the vote, and those al­le­ga­tions have esca</p>
    <p>lated since Mr Joe Bi­den was de­clared the win­ner by me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions after se­cur­ing enough elec­toral votes.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s fir­ing of Mr Krebs, which many had ex­pected, in­clud­ing Mr Krebs him­self, came after busi­ness hours and capped a day of set­backs and con­tro­versy in his sup­port­ers’ ef­forts to chal­lenge the elec­tion’s re­sults.</p>
    <p>In Penn­syl­va­nia, the state Supreme Court re­jected his cam­paign’s key ar­gu­ment that Repub­li­can vote ob­servers were kept too far away to prop­erly mon­i­tor bal­lot-count­ing, while in Michi­gan, GOP of­fi­cials stonewalle­d the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of the elec­tion out­come in the greater Detroit area be­fore agree­ing to cer­tify the re­sults.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing up to the elec­tion, Mr Krebs had used Cisa’s web­site to de­bunk claims of voter fraud be­ing</p>
    <p>ped­dled by Mr Trump and his sup­port­ers. The site chal­lenged al­le­ga­tions that votes had been cast on be­half of dead peo­ple and that “se­cret” wa­ter­marks on bal­lots were help­ing au­dit il­le­gal votes.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Pres­i­dent’s plan to nom­i­nate Mr Brooks as act­ing Comp­trol­ler of the Cur­rency (OCC) is a highly un­usual move – com­ing just weeks be­fore what is likely the end of Mr Trump’s time in of­fice. The move could force Mr Bi­den to rely on never-used le­gal author­ity to try to re­move Mr Brooks and re­place him with a more ag­gres­sive watch­dog.</p>
    <p>The law says a comp­trol­ler can be ousted by the pres­i­dent “upon rea­sons to be com­mu­ni­cated by him to the Se­nate” – a power that has gone untested.</p>
    <p>Most of the ma­jor reg­u­la­tions for US banks are writ­ten and ap­proved</p>
    <p>in col­lab­o­ra­tion among the Fed­eral Re­serve, Fed­eral De­posit In­sur­ance Corp (FDIC) and the OCC.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing Trump ap­pointees atop any of those agen­cies could af­fect how much rule-mak­ing can be done by Mr Bi­den’s own picks. The FDIC is al­ready ex­pected to be run by chair­man Je­lena McWilliams, a Trump nom­i­nee, un­til 2023, and Fed vice-chair­man for su­per­vi­sion Ran­dal Quar­les can stay in his role un­til late next year. The OCC was thought to be the only slot im­me­di­ately open for Mr Bi­den to start re­mak­ing bank­ing pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Mr Brooks would not have much time to be con­firmed be­fore Mr Bi­den is sworn in on Jan 20. He must face a hear­ing be­fore the Se­nate Bank­ing Com­mit­tee and needs to be ap­proved by that panel be­fore his nom­i­na­tion could be con­sid­ered by the Se­nate.</p>
