    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian coun­ter­part Muhyid­din Yassin had a dis­cus­sion over video con­fer­ence on the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High­Speed Rail (HSR) project yes­ter­day, both lead­ers said in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>They took stock of the progress of dis­cus­sions on the project, and gained a good un­der­stand­ing of Malaysia’s and Sin­ga­pore’s re­spec­tive po­si­tions, the prime min­is­ters added. Their dis­cus­sion comes ahead of the Dec 31 dead­line for the sec­ond and fi­nal ex­ten­sion of the sus­pen­sion of the bi­lat­eral project.</p>
    <p>“Both sides will an­nounce fur­ther de­tails on the HSR project through a joint state­ment in due course,” the lead­ers said in their state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Both prime min­is­ters also reaf­firmed the strong bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries cov­er­ing many ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion and the sin­cere de­sire to fur­ther strengthen these re­la­tions for mu­tual ben­e­fit.”</p>
    <p>Their joint state­ment comes in the wake of re­marks by both coun­tries on dis­cus­sions over changes to the project, which was an­nounced in 2010.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed 350km line would cut travel time be­tween the two cities to 90 min­utes, com­pared with over four hours by car.</p>
    <p>On Nov 25, a spokesman for Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) said Malaysia had pro­posed some changes to the HSR project, adding that Sin­ga­pore has been dis­cussing them in good faith with Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Malaysia’s Eco­nomic Af­fairs Min­is­ter Mustapa Mo­hamed said the Malaysian gov­ern­ment had yet to fi­nalise plans for the HSR project.</p>
    <p>He said Malaysia had made sev­eral new pro­pos­als to “im­prove”</p>
    <p>the project and was still in the process of ne­go­ti­at­ing these with Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The re­marks come af­ter a news re­port last week by Malaysian web­site Free Malaysia To­day that claimed KL was con­sid­er­ing changes so that the line ends in Jo­hor Baru in­stead of Sin­ga­pore, a move that would call into ques­tion the sus­tain­abil­ity of the project.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the re­port, the MOT spokesman said last week that Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to be­lieve that the HSR project is ben­e­fi­cial for both coun­tries, and re­mains fully com­mit­ted to ful­fill­ing its obli­ga­tions un­der the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“We will make our best ef­forts to con­clude dis­cus­sions with Malaysia by Dec 31, 2020,” the spokesman said, adding that if by Dec 31, Malaysia does not pro­ceed with the project, it will – un­der agree­ments be­tween both coun­tries – bear the agreed costs in­curred by Sin­ga­pore in ful­fill­ing the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries signed the bi­lat­eral agree­ment, a legally bind­ing in­ter­na­tional pact, in Putrajaya in De­cem­ber 2016, wit­nessed by PM Lee and then Malaysian PM Na­jib Razak. But af­ter a change of gov­ern­ment fol­low­ing the 2018 Malaysian gen­eral elec­tion, then PM Ma­hathir Mo­hamad ini­tially wanted to scrap the HSR, as part of a re­view of mega projects.</p>
    <p>The Pakatan Hara­pan ad­min­is­tra­tion later clar­i­fied that it wanted to de­lay the start of con­struc­tion, as a can­cel­la­tion would have en­tailed a high amount of com­pen­sa­tion un­der the HSR agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries agreed to sus­pend the project, at Malaysia’s re­quest. The first ex­ten­sion in Septem­ber 2018 was to end in May this year, but it was ex­tended for a sec­ond and fi­nal time, till Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Both sides will an­nounce fur­ther de­tails on the HSR project through a joint state­ment in due course. Both prime min­is­ters also reaf­firmed the strong bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries cov­er­ing many ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion and the sin­cere de­sire to fur­ther strengthen these re­la­tions for mu­tual ben­e­fit.</p>
