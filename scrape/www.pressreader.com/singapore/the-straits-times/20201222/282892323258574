    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You need to get started on some­thing new, so make sure you have the time to take off on your own. Al­most any­thing you de­cide on is likely to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Try not to zip out the door with your wal­let as soon as you hear about that new gad­get. This is not the time to make hasty de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Lis­ten care­fully when your peo­ple start telling you what is what, even if they can­not ex­press them­selves smoothly. Their ad­vice can make a real dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Find a ra­tio­nal so­lu­tion to this prac­ti­cal prob­lem be­cause emo­tional re­sponses are sure to get you nowhere. Try to just see every­thing as a puz­zle of some sort.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are in the midst of a new learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. Make sure you are push­ing your­self and tak­ing on a new chal­lenge or this time could be wasted.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your sense of pur­pose is rekin­dled.</p>
    <p>You should know when it hap­pens, as things just start to feel much big­ger than they had be­fore.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Ro­mance is in the air and you are more ex­cited by some other new re­la­tion­ship, but it is im­por­tant to keep every­thing bal­anced.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>A mi­nor health prob­lem is turn­ing into an an­noy­ance. Force your­self to take it se­ri­ously, so you do not turn it into an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>A kid makes a big im­pres­sion on you. This could be one of your own, some­one who comes into work or even a kid you see on tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Break off that toxic re­la­tion­ship, fin­ish that colos­sal project or just try quit­ting that bad habit one fi­nal time. You can do it.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>One big idea is all you need, so make sure you are fo­cus­ing and getting a friend or col­league to help you win­now down the list.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>It is hard to get to the root of the is­sue, thanks to a mys­te­ri­ous party that has not quite come within your field of view yet. Hang in there – the fog will lift soon.</p>
