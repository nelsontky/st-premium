    <p>The ul­ti­mate aim of at­tract­ing com­pa­nies to Sin­ga­pore and al­low­ing them to hire for­eign­ers is to cre­ate jobs and to im­prove the lives of cit­i­zens, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day as he told Sin­ga­pore­ans that the Gov­ern­ment is al­ways on their side.</p>
    <p>This open­ness has helped cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, and even as Sin­ga­pore ad­justs its poli­cies on work passes, it must be care­ful not to send the wrong sig­nal that the coun­try is no longer wel­com­ing to oth­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>Re­it­er­at­ing the prom­ise made by sev­eral min­is­ters who had spo­ken be­fore him in the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, PM Lee said: “The Gov­ern­ment will al­ways be on the side of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“What is the point of cre­at­ing jobs for for­eign­ers if it does not ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore­ans? Why would we want to do that? Ul­ti­mately, our aim is to grow our econ­omy, cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans and raise our standards of liv­ing.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has suc­ceeded on this front in part by be­ing an in­ter­na­tional hub and serv­ing a global mar­ket, as well as by tap­ping for­eign tal­ent, he added.</p>
    <p>His re­marks fol­lowed two days of de­bate dur­ing which the House dis­cussed the is­sue of the for­eign work­force in Sin­ga­pore, with many MPs call­ing for more pro­tec­tion for the Sin­ga­porean core in the work­force.</p>
    <p>They shared sto­ries from res­i­dents of hav­ing lost op­por­tu­ni­ties to for­eign­ers and be­ing out­num­bered in their of­fices, and ques­tioned whether the poli­cies on work passes had per­haps been too lax.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, speak­ing on the third day of the de­bate, ac­knowl­edged that Sin­ga­pore­ans are con­cerned about fair­ness and said that the Gov­ern­ment takes it seriously.</p>
    <p>He noted that the num­bers of Em­ploy­ment Pass and S Pass hold­ers have come down since the Covid-19 pan­demic, and work pass schemes con­tinue to be ad­justed.</p>
    <p>But he added: “There is no com­fort in know­ing that the to­tal num</p>
    <p>bers are not too many, if per­son­ally, we feel that we have been dis­crim­i­nated against at the work­place, or that the Em­ploy­ment Pass holder work­ing be­side us some­how has an in­side track.”</p>
    <p>He said that i n con­sid­er­ing whether or not to is­sue Em­ploy­ment and S passes, the Gov­ern­ment looks at whether an em­ployer has kept up its sup­port of lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, en­gi­neers and tech­ni­cians.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, when a company has an over-con­cen­tra­tion of a sin­gle for­eign na­tion­al­ity in its ranks, es­pe­cially com­pared with other com­pa­nies in the same sec­tor, it sug­gests that the company has not re­ally taken root in Sin­ga­pore, he added.</p>
    <p>“This con­cen­tra­tion, if it is unchecked, can cause so­cial re­sent­ment and work­place prob­lems. It makes it harder for the company to</p>
    <p>blend into and be ac­cepted by our mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It can cause prob­lems within the company too, be­cause em­ploy­ees of other na­tion­al­i­ties – Sin­ga­porean or oth­ers – may find it harder to fit in, take pride in their work and see a fu­ture for them­selves in the firm.”</p>
    <p>Most com­pa­nies have been re­spon­sive when asked to relook their hir­ing prac­tices, he added, re­mind­ing firms to play their part in sup­port­ing Sin­ga­porean work­ers. In fact, he said, many global com­pa­nies un­der­stand the ad­van­tages of hav­ing a di­verse work­force and have ex­plicit hu­man re­sources poli­cies to fos­ter it.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the Gov­ern­ment had worked to at­tract such for­eign com­pa­nies to set up shop here and had al­lowed them to tap for­eign tal­ent when Sin­ga­pore did not have</p>
    <p>work­ers with the skill sets needed.</p>
    <p>But this was on the ba­sis that the com­pa­nies would also hire Sin­ga­pore­ans and help train them so that they can rise up the ranks and take on these jobs over time, PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>He noted that lo­cal com­pa­nies such as small and medium-sized en­ter­prises some­times also hire global tal­ent who bring with them the ex­per­tise and knowl­edge needed to move up the value chain.</p>
    <p>“And by do­ing so, they too cre­ate good, new jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans be­sides pro­mot­ing en­trepreneur­ship and mak­ing it eas­ier and more at­trac­tive to start com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore,” he added.</p>
    <p>While the eco­nomic ben­e­fits of Sin­ga­pore’s for­eign worker poli­cies were clear, there was a more fun­da­men­tal ques­tion at the cen­tre of the de­bate on for­eign pro­fes­sion­als</p>
    <p>and the Sin­ga­porean core, he said: “What sort of so­ci­ety, what sort of peo­ple do we want to be?”</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cally, Sin­ga­pore as an open port and im­mi­grant na­tion has al­ways been open to the world and wel­com­ing to oth­ers who can add value to so­ci­ety, he added.</p>
    <p>“This gen­eros­ity of spirit gives our so­ci­ety and econ­omy vi­tal­ity and re­silience. It has made Sin­ga­pore the ex­cep­tional, cos­mopoli­tan city that we are to­day, plugged into the global econ­omy and mak­ing a liv­ing by mak­ing our­selves valu­able to the world ,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We may be un­der stress now, but we can­not af­ford to turn in­wards. We will ad­just our poli­cies to safe­guard Sin­ga­porean jobs, but let us show con­fi­dence that Sin­ga­pore­ans can hold our own in the world .”</p>
