    <p>Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­tions are al­ways im­por­tant. But they are not al­ways sem­i­nal. Even if the party and oc­cu­pant of the White House change, this does not nec­es­sar­ily change poli­cies.</p>
    <p>If Mr Joe Bi­den de­feats Mr Don­ald Trump, we should not ex­pect fun­da­men­tal shifts in the tra­jec­tory of Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy. The changes will be mainly of style and at­mo­spher­ics and in the pro­cesses by which de­ci­sions are made and com­mu­ni­cated. These are im­por­tant but not fun­da­men­tal changes.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s per­son­al­ity is unique. But he and his poli­cies were symp­toms of trans­for­ma­tions in the Amer­i­can body politic and of global trends that were al­ready un­der way when he was elected in 2016, and which will con­tinue to un­fold af­ter he leaves of­fice. Who­ever suc­ceeds Mr Trump, whether next year or in 2025, will have to deal with these changes and trends.</p>
    <p>For more than 40 years, Amer­i­cans sto­ically bore the risks, sac­ri­fices and ex­er­tions of the Cold War. Af­ter 9/11, they were called upon to en­dure seem­ingly in­ter­minable con­flicts in the</p>
    <p>Mid­dle East, while suf­fer­ing the eco­nomic, fi­nan­cial, so­cial and cul­tural dis­rup­tions of un­re­strained post-Cold War glob­al­i­sa­tion. We should not be sur­prised if Amer­i­cans are no longer will­ing to pay any price and bear any bur­den to main­tain in­ter­na­tional or­der.</p>
    <p>A NEW EQUI­LIB­RIUM</p>
    <p>Amer­ica did not seek to with­draw from the world. That is im­pos­si­ble. But it sought a new equi­lib­rium with it. The United States re­cal­i­brated its eco­nomic and mil­i­tary en­gage­ments, and defined its in­ter­ests more nar­rowly and with less con­sid­er­a­tion for friends and al­lies. Mr Trump was de­ter­mined that the US’ ri­vals not take advantage of Amer­i­can gen­eros­ity. But he did not in­vent uni­lat­er­al­ism or trans­ac­tion­al­ism. He only ac­cen­tu­ated ten­den­cies that were al­ways present in Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>We should not ide­alise pre-Trump Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy as if it was some sort of golden age.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing Mr Trump has done has been as dis­rup­tive of in­ter­na­tional or­der as when Mr Richard Nixon uni­lat­er­ally un­pegged the dol­lar from gold in Au­gust 1971, de­stroy­ing the Bret­ton Woods sys­tem overnight and ir­re­vo­ca­bly chang­ing the world’s mon­e­tary and fi­nan­cial sys­tems, not nec­es­sar­ily for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Nixon’s an­nounce­ment a month be­fore that he would visit China shocked Ja­pan, which re­ceived no prior warn­ing de­spite be­ing the prin­ci­pal US ally in East Asia. The Shin­ing City Upon a Hill has al­ways cast a dark shadow, a fact al­ways more ev­i­dent to those who have had to live un­der the hill than on the hill.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and his pre­de­ces­sor Barack Obama are more alike than ei­ther may care to ad­mit. Both are un­con­ven­tional lead­ers whose vic­to­ries re­flected the dis­il­lu­sion­ment of dif­fer­ent sec­tions of the Amer­i­can pub­lic with the US po­lit­i­cal es­tab­lish­ment. Their styles and con­stituen­cies may have been dif­fer­ent, but the out­come was sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>When Mr Obama won the pres­i­dency in 2008 with the slo­gan “Change We Can Be­lieve In”, Amer­i­can vot­ers did not un­der­stand him as pri­mar­ily re­fer­ring to change abroad. They took it as a prom­ise that long ne­glected do­mes­tic is­sues would now be ad­dressed and it was time to put Amer­ica’s own house in or­der; or, to use Mr Trump’s slo­gan, to “Put Amer­ica First”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s “Made in All of Amer­ica” eco­nomic plan plays to this po­lit­i­cal mood. If elected, his pri­or­ity will be deal­ing with the do­mes­tic eco­nomic con­se­quences of the pan­demic, not for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Nor will he have a to­tally free hand. The deep di­vi­sions in the Demo­cratic Party that were on dis­play dur­ing the pri­maries have not been re­solved. If Mr Bi­den wins, they will cer­tainly quickly resur­face and pull his poli­cies in dif­fer­ent direc­tions.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how Mr Bi­den will bal­ance the need to main­tain the sup­port of the pro­gres­sive wing of his party with the con­cerns of the tra­di­tional Demo­cratic base, as well as those of other con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den vic­tory may not be a clear man­date for any Demo­cratic cause be­cause many would have voted for him sim­ply be­cause he is not Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>What then can we ex­pect from the next ad­min­is­tra­tion?</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump wins again, he will see this as vin­di­ca­tion. He will dou­ble down on what he is al­ready do­ing. What fol­lows will there­fore fo­cus on is­sues that may arise should Mr Bi­den win. We should be clear that there is no go­ing back to the pre-Trump sta­tus quo ante.</p>
    <p>CHINA AND TRADE</p>
    <p>No is­sue is more im­por­tant than US-China re­la­tions. Strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion is now a struc­tural con­di­tion of that re­la­tion­ship on which there is a bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus. No pres­i­dent will risk be­ing ac­cused of weak­ness. The Bi­den cam­paign has vowed to be tough on China and crit­i­cised Mr Trump’s ap­proach only as “er­ratic”, not wrong.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will not re­move the re­stric­tions on ex­ports of tech­nol­ogy to China, al­though he will try to sta­bilise re­la­tions and im­prove their at­mo­spher­ics by im­ple­ment­ing them in a more or­derly and trans­par­ent man­ner. His gen­eral ap­proach to­wards trade is likely to be Trump-lite. He will not re­join the Trans Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) or undo Mr Trump’s re­vi­sions of other free trade agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is not as en­thu­si­as­tic about tar­iffs as Pres­i­dent Trump, but he is un­likely to quickly re­move ex­ist­ing tar­iffs or aban­don the Phase 1 trade deal. He has vowed to re­form the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion and promised “ag­gres­sive trade en­force­ment ac­tions” against un­fair prac­tices by China and other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has nor­malised the use of tar­iffs. The only ques­tion is what</p>
    <p>they will be used for in a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has called Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping a “thug”. He will not re­move the sanc­tions im­posed on China be­cause of the treat­ment of Uighurs and Hong Kong. In­deed, such hu­man rights is­sues may be­come a more cen­tral part of the US-China agenda on his watch.</p>
    <p>Un­like Mr Trump, whose ad­min­is­tra­tion’s first year or so was tainted by Is­lam­o­pho­bia, Mr Bi­den’s ap­proach to Xin­jiang may res­onate more cred­i­bly and strongly with a global Ummah that is al­ready more aware of the abuse of Mus­lims in China.</p>
    <p>SOUTH-EAST ASIA</p>
    <p>The Indo-Pa­cific was pleased by Mr Obama’s “pivot” to Asia; Asean was par­tic­u­larly flat­tered that Mr Obama both­ered to at­tend al­most all of its meet­ings; Asean, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and New Zealand were shocked by Pres­i­dent Trump’s re­pu­di­a­tion of the TPP.</p>
    <p>But the re­gion soon re­alised that al­though Mr Obama made won­der­ful speeches and en­joyed the pomp and cer­e­mony of diplo­macy, he was hes­i­tant about ex­er­cis­ing power.</p>
    <p>The “pivot” was more talk than sub­stance and there was less to it than met the eye. Un­der Pres­i­dent Obama, the US bro­kered a deal be­tween its ally the Philip­pines and China on Scar­bor­ough Shoal, but did noth­ing when China broke it. When the 7th Fleet con­ducted free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion oper­a­tions to chal­lenge China’s ex­trav­a­gant claims in the South China Sea, very pub­lic de­bates be­tween the Pen­tagon and White House broke out that un­der­mined their ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Mr Obama did noth­ing on North Korea for eight years and called it “strate­gic pa­tience”.</p>
    <p>Al­though most Asean mem­bers will not say so in pub­lic, China’s ag­gres­sive­ness in the South China Sea and else­where has led to a bet­ter ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the vi­tal role of the US and Mr Trump’s mus­cu­lar ap­proach.</p>
    <p>The stronger po­si­tion the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has taken on the South China Sea and its re­cent re­fo­cus on main­land South-east Asia af­ter the sec­ond Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion seemed to lose in­ter­est in its own Lower Mekong Ini­tia­tive, has en­cour­aged Asean. It</p>
    <p>may have em­bold­ened some Asean claimants to stand up for their rights.</p>
    <p>In­stinc­tively and in­choately, Pres­i­dent Trump un­der­stands the re­al­i­ties of power pol­i­tics. When Mr Obama drew a “red line” in Syria over chem­i­cal weapons but failed to en­force it, Asean and the en­tire Indo-Pa­cific were dis­mayed; when Mr Trump bombed Syria while hav­ing din­ner with Mr Xi, the re­gion qui­etly cheered the restora­tion of the cred­i­bil­ity of Amer­i­can power and its de­ter­rent ef­fect.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, at times the sec­ond Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion did not seem to un­der­stand in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>One of the most fool­ish state­ments I have ever heard through­out my diplo­matic ca­reer was Sec­re­tary of State John Kerry crit­i­cis­ing Rus­sia’s ac­tions in Ukraine by call­ing it 19th cen­tury be­hav­iour in the 21st cen­tury. It seemed to as­sume that your ri­vals must share your val­ues and play by your rules. Why should they?</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the sec­ond Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion re­port­edly in­structed agen­cies to down­play com­pe­ti­tion with China in or­der to se­cure its co­op­er­a­tion on cli­mate change. But states co­op­er­ate when their in­ter­ests re­quire them to co­op­er­ate. The en­vi­ron­ment is a key Chi­nese do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal con­cern. Bei­jing would have worked to con­clude the 2015 Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change ir­re­spec­tive of com­pe­ti­tion with the US.</p>
    <p>Justly or not, Mr Bi­den, as Mr Obama’s Vice-Pres­i­dent, will be con­sid­ered com­plicit in and tainted by these de­ci­sions. Most coun­tries will be too po­lite to say so, but he will come to of­fice weighed down by all of Mr Obama’s bag­gage.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will be care­fully watched for any sign that he, like Mr Obama, is in­clined to “lead from be­hind”. Who Mr Bi­den ap­points as sec­re­taries of state and de­fence and as na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser will be cru­cial.</p>
    <p>Asean and the rest of the Indo-Pa­cific will need to be as­sured that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion has a strate­gic view of the re­gion and will not be dis­tracted by hu­man rights and other sec­ond-or­der is­sues.</p>
    <p>EUROPE AND RUS­SIA</p>
    <p>There has been spec­u­la­tion that by treat­ing the Transat­lantic Al­liance more re­spect­fully, Mr Bi­den may put to­gether an ef­fec­tive global coali­tion against China. An in­for­mal coali­tion in fact al­ready ex­ists, and not be­cause of any­thing any Amer­i­can pres­i­dent did.</p>
    <p>No one will ever shun China. But key Euro­pean Union mem­bers like Ger­many and France, as well as Bri­tain, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and In­dia – in fact al­most ev­ery ma­jor econ­omy – all find cer­tain as­pects of Chi­nese be­hav­iour un­ac­cept­able. Mr Bi­den may give this in­for­mal coali­tion clearer def­i­ni­tion and a more co­or­di­nated ap­proach in spe­cific ar­eas such as tech­nol­ogy ex­ports. But he will not cre­ate it and there are lim­its.</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sive US ad­min­is­tra­tions have pressed Europe to do more in its own de­fence. All have failed and Mr Bi­den is not likely to do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>For Europe to spend more on de­fence, it will have to cut back its so­cial model, which is un­sus­tain­able as a mat­ter of ac­tu­ar­ial cer­tainty. So far, Europe has not found the po­lit­i­cal will or courage to do so. With­out hard power, the EU plays al­most no role in the Indo-Pa­cific, the key the­atre of US-China com­pe­ti­tion which at its core is about hard power. You can­not have “soft” power with­out hard power.</p>
    <p>A re­set of US-Rus­sia re­la­tions is un­likely. Rus­sia is not with­out its own con­cerns about China. But work­ing with China to di­min­ish US in­flu­ence is the more com­pelling strate­gic logic to Moscow. For Mr Bi­den, Moscow’s be­hav­iour in­ter­nally and in its near-abroad such as in Be­larus will be the more im­me­di­ate con­cerns.</p>
    <p>But un­like the for­mer Soviet Union, Rus­sia is not an ex­is­ten­tial threat to Amer­ica. Ab­sent such a threat, the Transat­lantic Al­liance is in­evitably loos­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Sooner or later, the US will play the same role in Europe as it al­ready does in the Indo-Pa­cific: an off-shore bal­ancer with min­i­mal forces on the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has crit­i­cised Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to re­duce the US mil­i­tary pres­ence in Ger­many. He may pause or slow the process, but can­not re­verse this long-term trend.</p>
    <p>THE MID­DLE EAST</p>
    <p>Since Pres­i­dent Obama, the US has sought to dis­en­gage its ground forces from the Mid­dle East and Afghanista­n. In­tro­duc­ing ground forces was a mis­take in the first place. The draw­down of ground forces will con­tinue un­der a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, al­though per­haps at a slower pace. No ad­min­is­tra­tion has, how­ever, ever sug­gested that the US 5th Fleet leave Bahrain or the US Air Force leave Qatar. The re­cal­i­bra­tion re­turns the US to its usual off-shore bal­ancer role.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den sup­ports the Iran nu­clear deal and will try to re­sus­ci­tate it. He has also said he will try to ne­go­ti­ate a stronger new deal than the 2015 Joint Com­pre­hen­sive Plan of Ac­tion (JCPOA). Nei­ther will be easy. It is not clear how se­ri­ously a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will pur­sue these goals or whether, if he in­deed starts ne­go­ti­a­tions, it is only to dis­tin­guish him­self from his pre­de­ces­sor with­out re­ally ex­pect­ing to con­clude an agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den may make some ges­tures to­wards Pales­tine and adopt a cooler ap­proach to­wards Saudi Ara­bia be­cause of hu­man rights con­cerns. He has a long­stand­ing strong com­mit­ment to Is­rael’s se­cu­rity and has said he will con­tinue to recog­nise Jerusalem as Is­rael’s cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>He has also said that he will con­tinue Mr Trump’s ef­forts to get Arab coun­tries to recog­nise Is­rael. In ef­fect this means that Mr Bi­den will con­tinue to sup­port and en­cour­age the emerg­ing anti-Iran coali­tion. How he will square this with re­viv­ing the JCPOA re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how Mr Bi­den will bal­ance the need to main­tain the sup­port of the pro­gres­sive wing of his party with the con­cerns of the tra­di­tional Demo­cratic base, as well as those of other con­stituen­cies. A Bi­den vic­tory may not be a clear man­date for any Demo­cratic cause be­cause many would have voted for him sim­ply be­cause he is not Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>Ev­ery new pres­i­dent feels obliged to pre­tend to re­make the world anew. How will Mr Bi­den try to dis­tin­guish him­self? He has said that he will quickly con­vene a global sum­mit on cli­mate change and re­join the Paris Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>If they ma­te­ri­alise, these sym­bolic ges­tures are to be wel­comed. But they will not erase the many in­ter­nal com­plex­i­ties and con­tra­dic­tions a new ad­min­is­tra­tion must con­front and rec­on­cile.</p>
    <p>Nor for that mat­ter will they deal with the sub­stan­tive prob­lem of cli­mate change. That will re­quire a depth of con­certed in­ter­na­tional ac­tion that, alas, even a pre-pan­demic world was un­able to muster.</p>
    <p>In­stinc­tively and in­choately, Pres­i­dent Trump un­der­stands the re­al­i­ties of power pol­i­tics. When Mr Obama drew a “red line” in Syria over chem­i­cal weapons but failed to en­force it, Asean and the en­tire Indo-Pa­cific were dis­mayed; when Mr Trump bombed Syria while hav­ing din­ner with Mr Xi, the re­gion qui­etly cheered the restora­tion of the cred­i­bil­ity of Amer­i­can power and its de­ter­rent ef­fect.</p>
