    <p>Mea­sures for con­tain­ing the spread of Covid-19 would still hold for the fast-spread­ing strain cir­cu­lat­ing in Bri­tain that may show up in more cases here, un­less it gets loose in the com­mu­nity, said in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­perts. So far, there is one case here with the B117 strain – a 17-year-old Sin­ga­porean who ar­rived from Bri­tain on Dec 6.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures for con­tain­ing the spread of Covid-19 would still hold for the fast-spread­ing strain cir­cu­lat­ing in Bri­tain, which may show up in more cases here, un­less it gets loose in the com­mu­nity, said in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­perts.</p>
    <p>So far, there is one confirmed case with the more con­ta­gious B117 strain in Sin­ga­pore, a 17-yearold Sin­ga­porean who ar­rived from Bri­tain on Dec 6.</p>
    <p>There are at least 13 oth­ers with pos­i­tive pre­lim­i­nary tests for the strain, in­clud­ing a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines pi­lot and a work pass holder re­turn­ing from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>“The com­mu­nity does not need to be par­tic­u­larly wor­ried about (the new strain), es­pe­cially if peo­ple con­tinue to prac­tise the in­di­vid­ual safe man­age­ment mea­sures such as mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing,” said Pro­fes­sor</p>
    <p>Teo Yik Ying, who is dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, an ex­pert in emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, said cur­rent con­trol mea­sures should suf­fice as the Bri­tish vari­ant is still spread mainly through res­pi­ra­tory droplets.</p>
    <p>But As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Saw Swee Hock School, said “things may change if we start to see trans­mis­sion of the English vari­ant that we can’t nip in the bud through con­tact trac­ing and test­ing”.</p>
    <p>The B117 strain is re­port­edly 70 per cent more con­ta­gious, but has not shown signs of be­ing more lethal or se­vere. A Bri­tish anal­y­sis found that the vari­ant is linked to a higher vi­ral load in res­pi­ra­tory sam­ples, which may be why it is more trans­mis­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has in­sti­tuted travel re­stric­tions against Bri­tain, for­bid­ding all long-term pass hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors who have been there within the last 14 days from en­ter­ing or tran­sit­ing through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>From Mon­day, the same re­stric­tions will ap­ply to trav­ellers from</p>
    <p>South Africa, where another po­ten­tially more con­ta­gious strain is cir­cu­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>Asked if there was a need to re­vise the stay-home no­tice be­yond 14 days in the light of the more con­ta­gious strains, ex­perts said that this was not nec­es­sary as there are only a few peo­ple who turn up with the in­fec­tion af­ter the quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said balanc­ing case pre­ven­tion and costs is needed to keep public health mea­sures sus­tain­able. “Cater­ing to ex­tremes of in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod and unusual cases would make Covid-19 pre­ven­tion in Sin­ga­pore even more costly,” he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook sug­gests in­creas­ing the num­ber of tests for those on quar­an­tine in­stead.</p>
    <p>To pro­tect the coun­try against more con­ta­gious strains, 90 per cent or more of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion may need to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Bri­tain re­ported 55,892 Covid-19 cases, its high­est daily to­tal for the year, mostly driven by the new vari­ant.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said the virus has been mu­tat­ing since the pan­demic, but most mutations have not af­fected trans­mis­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist Leong Hoe Nam said: “The virus is only in­ter­ested in world dom­i­na­tion. It is in the virus’ interest to mu­tate to a milder strain or a strain that is more trans­mis­si­ble, in­stead of one that will kill the host.”</p>
    <p>Places that have large out­breaks of­fer more fod­der for the virus to mu­tate.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Gavin Smith, in­terim di­rec­tor of Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School’s emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme, said the best way to stop new vari­ants emerg­ing is to stop out­breaks of Covid-19, so the work on Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes it, must con­tinue.</p>
    <p>He said: “Most mutations are what we call ‘neu­tral’ – they don’t change the virus’ be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“But oc­ca­sion­ally, there will be mutations that change the virus’ be­hav­iour in un­pre­dictable ways. So it is im­por­tant that public health agen­cies and sci­en­tists re­main vig­i­lant and keep track of any new vari­ants that might emerge.”</p>
    <p>NO NEED FOR ALARM</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity does not need to be par­tic­u­larly wor­ried about (the new strain), es­pe­cially if peo­ple con­tinue to prac­tise the in­di­vid­ual safe man­age­ment mea­sures such as mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
