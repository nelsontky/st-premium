    <p>Orig­i­nally from Shan­tou city i n China’s Guang­dong prov­ince, she moved to Sin­ga­pore with her fam­ily in 1926 when she was seven years old and spoke only Teochew.</p>
    <p>When she started school at Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Girls’ School (SCGS), she had to learn English to com­mu­ni­cate with her teach­ers and peers, and was even hit on the hand once when she could not un­der­stand one of her teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Miss Tan Sock Kern would even­tu­ally go on to be­come a teacher at the school, and be­tween 1956 and 1978, she led it as its prin­ci­pal.</p>
    <p>A prom­i­nent fig­ure in Sin­ga­pore’s ed­u­ca­tion fra­ter­nity, she died at the age of 102 last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mrs Eu­ge­nia Lim, SCGS’ cur­rent prin­ci­pal, told The Straits Times that Miss Tan had been “a wellloved prin­ci­pal who firmly be­lieved in the em­pow­er­ment of girls through ed­u­ca­tion and was an ex­cel­lent role model in be­ing a coura­geous change-maker”.</p>
    <p>“Un­der her out­stand­ing lead­er­ship, the qual­ity of holis­tic ed­u­ca­tion was raised, the fa­cil­i­ties of the school (in the Emer­ald Hill cam­pus) were ex­panded, and SCGS be­came a much sought-af­ter school for girls,” Mrs Lim said.</p>
    <p>A post on the SCGS Face­book page on Sun­day said that many staff had viewed her as “a kind and car­ing leader who em­pow­ered, trusted and lifted up all un­der her charge”.</p>
    <p>“Miss Tan will be re­mem­bered for her dy­namism, ded­i­ca­tion, strength of char­ac­ter and in­de­pen­dent streak,” said the post by the school, which is now lo­cated in Dun­earn Road.</p>
    <p>Miss Tan at­tended Raf­fles Girls’ School, be­sides SCGS, and Raf­fles Col­lege, where she stud­ied English, his­tory and geography. She grad­u­ated along­side former min­is­ters</p>
    <p>Goh Keng Swee and Hon Sui Sen.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles Col­lege merged with King Ed­ward VII Col­lege of Medicine in 1949 to form the Uni­ver­sity of Malaya, which be­came known as the Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore in 1962, and then the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore in 1980 af­ter merg­ing with Nanyang Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Af­ter uni­ver­sity, Miss Tan pur­sued a diploma in ed­u­ca­tion, and joined SCGS as a teacher in 1940.</p>
    <p>She did a sab­bat­i­cal at the Uni­ver­sity of West­ern Aus­tralia in 1948, and was nat­u­ralised as a Bri­tish cit­i­zen in Sin­ga­pore in 1951.</p>
    <p>Ms Suzanne Ng, 52, a grand-niece of Miss Tan’s and also an SCGS stu­dent when she was prin­ci­pal, said Miss Tan was a very bright and sharp woman, and was strict in school when it came to eti­quette.</p>
    <p>“I called her ‘lao yi’ when I saw her in school, be­cause she was my grand-aunt. She cor­rected me and said I should call her ‘Miss Tan’,” said Ms Ng, a polytech­nic hos­pi­tal­ity lec­turer.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the wake at Sin­ga­pore Cas­ket yes­ter­day, a num­ber of Miss Tan’s fam­ily mem­bers and former stu­dents were there, with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures ob­served.</p>
    <p>Miss Tan was the fourth of 14 chil­dren, and the sec­ond daugh­ter. She is sur­vived by younger sis­ters Sock Khee, 88, who was at the wake, and Sock Kia, 84, as well as a num­ber of other rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Sock Khee said Miss Tan had al­ways been in­de­pen­dent. Their father had tried nu­mer­ous times to match­make Miss Tan, but “she didn’t like the idea of some­one choos­ing a husband for her”.</p>
    <p>A son of a good friend of Miss Tan’s, who was also at the wake but did not want to be named, said the former prin­ci­pal had told him “fan­tas­tic” sto­ries about her ex­pe­ri­ence with match­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>“She didn’t want to marry. Ev­ery time her father brought a po­ten­tial suitor home, she would find out and es­cape from the house. She car­ried her shoes and climbed out of the win­dow to run away,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Sock Khee added: “At the time, my father didn’t want her to be ed­u­cated. He wanted her to get mar­ried. The idea was that girls should be seen and not heard.</p>
    <p>“But my sis­ter was def­i­nitely seen and heard. I was very in­spired by her and I de­cided to study very hard to prove to my dad that girls can be just as good as boys.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Sock Khee later stud­ied phar­ma­ceu­tics at uni­ver­sity, and mar­ried a doc­tor.</p>
    <p>Miss Tan had de­men­tia in her later years, and lived with Ms Tan Sock Kia be­fore be­ing sent in 2013 to Tai Pei Old Peo­ple’s Home in Balestier, af­ter a bad fall. The two sis­ters vis­ited Miss Tan there of­ten un­til re­cently, when vis­its were re­stricted due to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“By that time, she didn’t un­der­stand (what was hap­pen­ing with the pan­demic). She couldn’t talk and breathe well and she was suf­fer­ing,” said Ms Tan Sock Khee.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally miss see­ing her, but she was 102 and she lived such a full life. In a way, (her death) was mer­ci­ful.”</p>
    <p>A num­ber of Miss Tan’s former stu­dents who were at the wake said she had in­spired them to forge their own way in the world.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral prac­ti­tioner Serene Toh, 64, who grad­u­ated from the school in 1972, said Miss Tan taught them to be­lieve they should have their own ca­reers and be in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Toh, who also sits on the SCGS board of direc­tors: “I ap­pre­ci­ated her as a role model. We were not go­ing to just wait around for a Prince Charm­ing, but we all got things done for our­selves.”</p>
    <p>The fu­neral will be held at 4.30pm to­day at Mandai Cre­ma­to­rium.</p>
