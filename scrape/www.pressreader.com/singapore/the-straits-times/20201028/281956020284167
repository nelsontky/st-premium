    <p>PARIS • Fu­ture as­tro­nauts headed to the Moon may have an eas­ier time find­ing wa­ter and dig­ging up ice than had been thought.</p>
    <p>In a pa­per pub­lished in Mon­day’s Na­ture Astron­omy, a team of sci­en­tists used Sofia, an in­frared te­le­scope mounted in­side a 747 jumbo jet, to make ob­ser­va­tions that showed un­am­bigu­ous ev­i­dence of wa­ter on parts of the Moon where the sun shines.</p>
    <p>“This dis­cov­ery re­veals that wa­ter might be dis­trib­uted across the lu­nar sur­face and not lim­ited to the cold shad­owed places near the lu­nar poles,” said Dr Paul Hertz, di­rec­tor of the as­tro­physics di­vi­sion at the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa).</p>
    <p>Al­though that wa­ter could be dif­fi­cult to col­lect by as­tro­nauts, another group of re­searchers re­ported on Mon­day that in ad­di­tion to big, frigid, deep and po­ten­tially treach­er­ous craters in the Moon’s po­lar re­gions, smaller and shal­lower de­pres­sions in the same ar­eas may also be cold enough to hold on to wa­ter ice for mil­lions, if not bil­lions, of years.</p>
    <p>Th­ese small, wa­ter ice de­posits could be a “real game changer”, said Dr Paul Hayne, a pro­fes­sor of as­tro­phys­i­cal and plan­e­tary sci­ences at the Univer­sity of Colorado, who led that re­search.</p>
    <p>“It could make it much more ac­ces­si­ble to fu­ture as­tro­nauts and rover mis­sions.”</p>
    <p>Such ice might not only pro­vide wa­ter for fu­ture as­tro­nauts to drink, but wa­ter mol­e­cules can also be bro­ken apart into their con­stituent hy­dro­gen and oxy­gen atoms.</p>
    <p>The oxy­gen would give the as­tro­nauts some­thing to breathe.</p>
    <p>Hy­dro­gen and oxy­gen can also be used as rocket pro­pel­lant for trips home to Earth or even some day to Mars and be­yond.</p>
    <p>That is of in­ter­est to Nasa, which is plan­ning a hu­man mis­sion to the Moon in 2024 and wants to build a sus­tain­able pres­ence there by the end of the decade to pre­pare for on­ward travel to Mars.</p>
    <p>Dr Ja­cob Bleacher, chief ex­plo­ration sci­en­tist for Nasa’s Hu­man Ex­plo­ration and Op­er­a­tions Mis­sion Direc­torate, said it was cru­cial to find out more about where the wa­ter came from and how ac­ces­si­ble it is.</p>
    <p>“Wa­ter is ex­tremely crit­i­cal for deep space ex­plo­ration.</p>
    <p>“It’s a re­source of di­rect value for our as­tro­nauts,” he told re­porters, adding it was heavy and there­fore ex­pen­sive to take from Earth.</p>
    <p>“Any time we don’t need to pack wa­ter for our trip, we have an op­por­tu­nity to take other use­ful items with us, for in­stance pay­loads to do more sci­ence.”</p>
    <p>One of the new stud­ies was able to “un­am­bigu­ously” dis­tin­guish the spec­tral fin­ger­print of molec­u­lar wa­ter in a sun­lit area, said lead au­thor Casey Hon­ni­ball, of the Hawaii In­sti­tute of Geo­physics and Plan­e­tol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Us­ing data from the air­borne te­le­scope, re­searchers used a more pre­cise wave­length than had been used be­fore – six mi­crons in­stead of three.</p>
    <p>They found a wa­ter con­cen­tra­tion of about 100 to 400 parts per mil­lion at Clav­ius Crater, one of the largest to be vis­i­ble from Earth.</p>
    <p>“That’s roughly equiv­a­lent to a 12-ounce (355ml) bot­tle of wa­ter within a cu­bic me­tre of vol­ume of lu­nar soil,” Dr Hon­ni­ball said at a Nasa press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers be­lieve they orig­i­nate from so­lar winds or mi­cro-me­te­orites and think they might ei­ther be trapped in beads of glass or within the grains of the lu­nar sur­face to pro­tect them from the harsh at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond study, re­searchers looked at the Moon’s po­lar re­gions, where wa­ter ice has been de­tected in lu­nar craters that never see sun­light.</p>
    <p>Nasa in 2009 found wa­ter crys­tals in a deep crater near the Moon’s south­ern pole.</p>
    <p>But the new study found ev­i­dence of bil­lions of mi­cro-craters that could each cra­dle a mi­nus­cule amount of ice.</p>
    <p>The au­thors say this could mean that ap­prox­i­mately 40,000 sq km of the lu­nar sur­face has the ca­pac­ity to trap wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The mi­cro-craters should be as cold – around mi­nus 160 deg C – as the larger, kilo­me­tre-scale lu­nar hol­lows, Dr Hayne said, adding that there are “tens of bil­lions” of them.</p>
    <p>Sam­ples from th­ese cold traps could tell us more about how the</p>
    <p>Moon – and even Earth – got its wa­ter, Dr Hayne said, per­haps pro­vid­ing ev­i­dence of wa­ter delivered by as­teroids, comets and the so­lar wind.</p>
