    <p>In the face of food sup­ply dis­rup­tions caused by the Covid-19 cri­sis and a grow­ing taste for sus­tain­able con­sump­tion, the plant-based scene in Sin­ga­pore has gained plenty of mo­men­tum this year.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers are con­fi­dent de­mand will con­tinue to surge – boosted by the con­stant in­flux of new prod­ucts and more restau­rants serv­ing plant-based dishes.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor brands have ex­panded into Asia, with some sink­ing roots here to join plant-based start-ups such as Next Gen, Karana and Shiok Meats.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Cal­i­for­nia’s food man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pany Eat Just, which has part­nered a con­sor­tium led by in­vest­ment man­age­ment firm Proterra In­vest­ment Part­ners Asia to build and op­er­ate a</p>
    <p>US$120 mil­lion plant pro­tein pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity here. Eat Just is known for its plant-based egg prod­uct, Just Egg, which is made of mung beans.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Josh Tet­rick is look­ing to have the fa­cil­ity up in 18 months and is in the process of hir­ing staff and pick­ing a site.</p>
    <p>Malaysian plant-based meat com­pany Phuture de­buted its mince of­fer­ing here in May. It is</p>
    <p>also avail­able in Hong Kong and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Here, the prod­uct is used at food and bev­er­age out­lets like Chi­nese restau­rant Em­press and Asian fu­sion joint Morsels.</p>
    <p>The meat al­ter­na­tive is made from plant pro­tein sources, in­clud­ing pea and chick­pea, and of­fers a more tex­tured mouth­feel due to the in­cor­po­ra­tion of rice into the blend.</p>
    <p>Phuture will launch it in its home coun­try next year and also ex­pand</p>
    <p>to China and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Green Mon­day – by the peo­ple be­hind Om­niMeat – is set­ting up a “plant-based food hub” called Green Com­mon here in the first quar­ter of next year. It will show­case pi­o­neer­ing global foodtech in­no­va­tions, says founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer David Ye­ung.</p>
    <p>Om­niMeat, which launched its plant-based lun­cheon meat and meat strips in May in Hong Kong,</p>
    <p>will roll out the prod­ucts in Sin­ga­pore soon.</p>
    <p>Green Mon­day is also an in­vestor in Sin­ga­pore cell-based milk com­pany TurtleTree Labs, which makes milk with biotech­nol­ogy and with­out an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Mr Ye­ung says: “When you have ma­jor ven­ture cap­i­tal firms pour­ing re­sources and cap­i­tal into this seg­ment, it is a very clear sign that in­vestors see a macro pic­ture and why this shift is not a mat­ter of if, but when, this will hap­pen and go main­stream. Green en­ergy and green trans­porta­tion have al­ready hap­pened, and green food is def­i­nitely the next hori­zon.”</p>
    <p>NEW DISHES, NEW PROD­UCTS</p>
    <p>Last month, Ikea Sin­ga­pore launched a plant-based ver­sion of its pop­u­lar meat­balls – made of in­gre­di­ents such as yel­low pea pro­tein, oats, pota­toes, onions and ap­ples.</p>
    <p>In over two weeks, more than 3,500 por­tions (from $6.50 for eight pieces) – equiv­a­lent to al­most 50,000 plant-based balls – were sold at both its restau­rants in Alexan­dra and Tampines. In the same pe­riod, close to 1,500 re­tail packs ($8 each) of the plant-based balls were snapped up.</p>
    <p>Ikea Sin­ga­pore’s food man­ager Ae­son Ong says there are plans to bring in more plant-based items next year.</p>
    <p>Over at Three Buns Quay­side and Potato Head Sin­ga­pore i n Keong Saik Road, dishes from the sus­tain­able menus, which in­clude plant-based items, make up 30 to 35 per cent of to­tal food sales.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, group ex­ec­u­tive chef Adam Pen­ney rolled out more of such dishes – in part­ner­ship with Green Mon­day’s al­ter­na­tive meat brands. They in­clude the best-sell­ing Fish­less N Chips with bat­tered fish­less fil­lets; and ve­gan Omni Hus­tle “gong bao” burger, which comes with a seared Om­niMeat patty.</p>
    <p>On Mon­days, the burger is sold as part of a $20 plant-based set (which in­cludes a beer or cock­tail) at Potato Head Sin­ga­pore, to en­cour­age “Green Mon­days”.</p>
    <p>Chef Pen­ney does not rule out a full plant-based menu in fu­ture. “Plant-based in­gre­di­ents are get­ting bet­ter all the time and peo­ple are more con­scious than ever about what they con­sume,” he says.</p>
    <p>With new prod­ucts con­stantly en­ter­ing the mar­ket, more choices are on the ta­ble too.</p>
    <p>A month ago, on­line butch­ery The Meat Club added Aus­tralian plant-based com­pany v2­food’s mince ($11.20 for 250g) to its small se­lec­tion of meat al­ter­na­tives, which in­cludes chick­pea pat­ties by Aus­tralia’s Larder­fresh Foods.</p>
    <p>V2­food’s mince is made with soya pro­tein, and the com­pany is backed by the likes of the Goldman Sachs Group and Te­masek Hold- • ings.</p>
    <p>There are also plant-based op­tions for non-meat eaters, such as ve­gan but­ter, cheese and milk.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal start-up 4MY’s plant­based camem­bert cheese, for ex­am­ple, is made with cashews and co­conut oil, and was launched in Au­gust. It is avail­able on­line (www.4my.sg) and at Ev­ery­day Ve­gan Gro­cer at The Grand­stand.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian founder Clau­dia Co­mini, 35, who has been work­ing on ve­gan cheese recipes for the past two years, says a new cashew but­ter is in the works.</p>
    <p>She is also col­lab­o­rat­ing with other brands, such as lo­cal ve­gan cake brand Roa, to pro­duce a gift box for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>“It’s a long jour­ney ahead as many have pre-con­ceived no­tions about how plant-based food is bor­ing or taste­less. But new com­pa­nies are very in­no­va­tive and that will help the move­ment to grow,” she says.</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mistic about the con­tin­ued growth of plant-based food, Eat Just’s Mr Tet­rick says: “We will get to a time when most of our en­ergy will come from re­new­able sources. In 10 years or so, we will live in a world where the ma­jor­ity of meat, eggs, milk and fish can be con­sumed with­out need­ing to kill a sin­gle an­i­mal or chop down a tree.”</p>
