    <p>An ad­ver­tise­ment for e-pay­ments provider Nets fea­tur­ing ac­tor Den­nis Chew in brown­face – with dark­ened skin – to por­tray an In­dian man drew heavy crit­i­cism from the pub­lic. He was also made up as a Malay woman in tudung and a Chi­nese woman. The agen­cies be­hind the ad were ticked off by the reg­u­la­tors for pro­duc­ing an ad in poor taste and caus­ing of­fence to the mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>The ad prompted YouTube per­son­al­ity Preeti Nair, bet­ter known as Preetipls, and her mu­si­cian brother Sub­has to re­lease an ex­ple­tive-laden mu­sic video high­light­ing is­sues of racial stereo­typ­ing, dis­crim­i­na­tion and rep­re­sen­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>But Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shanmugam said the video had crossed the line. The sib­lings had ev­ery right to dis­cuss racism, he said, but they had gone about it the wrong way.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties took down the video on grounds of pub­lic in­ter­est and na­tional har­mony, and the po­lice later is­sued a two-year con­di­tional warn­ing to the sib­lings, cau­tion­ing that al­low­ing such videos would lead to “more racism, more racial ten­sions, and, even­tu­ally, vi­o­lence”.</p>
    <p>The “Preetipls in­ci­dent” trig­gered, and con­tin­ues to be part of, deeper dis­cus­sions on race. An­a­lysts see it as a ref­er­ence point for young Sin­ga­pore­ans who dis­agree with the Gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach to those ask­ing tough ques­tions on the topic.</p>
