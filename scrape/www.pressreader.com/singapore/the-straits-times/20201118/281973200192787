    <p>In the Bud­get de­bate ear­lier this year, MP Louis Ng called for par­ent-care leave to be leg­is­lated for all (Call for more child­care leave and care op­tions, Feb 28). He pointed out that em­ploy­ees in the pub­lic sec­tor are en­ti­tled to two days’ leave, but not all in the pri­vate sec­tor get this.</p>
    <p>I wel­come his call to re­view the is­sue, in view of an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and the in­creas­ing need for us to take on the roles of full- or part-time care­givers.</p>
    <p>Par­ent-care leave is not given the same at­ten­tion as other types of leave, such as child­care leave. This is un­for­tu­nate, as the care­giv­ing de­mands of the el­derly are stress­ful and may also re­quire the same amount of, if not more, time and financial re­sources as tak­ing care of the young.</p>
    <p>Even if a maid were hired to take care of el­derly par­ents, there is still a need for fam­ily care­givers to de­vote time to at­tend­ing to ad­min­is­tra­tive is­sues and pro­vid­ing over­sight and train­ing to the maid to en­sure base­line stan­dards are met.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the care­giver sup­port re­sources avail­able in­clude for­eign do­mes­tic worker grants, flexi-work ar­range­ments, respite care, un­paid leave and pro­fes­sional care­giver train­ing pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>In both good and bad ways, the pan­demic has up­ended the way peo­ple work, forc­ing many em­ploy­ers to in­sti­tute more flexible work­ing ar­range­ments. I be­lieve this will ben­e­fit em­ploy­ees whose job nature is more ad­min­is­tra­tive or back-end, al­low­ing them to stream­line their work de­liv­er­ables and bal­ance care­giv­ing de­mands.</p>
    <p>How­ever, those who are work­ing in front-line roles will not ben­e­fit equally from th­ese ar­range­ments. It may be im­por­tant to ad­dress this gap and en­sure that work ben­e­fits re­main com­pet­i­tive for those in sec­tors with a man­power crunch, like the health­care in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment should leg­is­late parental care leave and make more al­lowances for cer­tain sub­groups – such as those in front-line jobs or those who are sole care­givers. The ex­tra days of leave may not ad­dress the de­mands of the care­giver com­pletely, but they will def­i­nitely al­le­vi­ate the stres­sors con­tribut­ing to care­giv­ing dis­tress, no­tably the lack of time to go for pro­fes­sional care­giver train­ing and at­tend to ex­i­gen­cies, such as sud­den hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The year of Covid-19 has dec­i­mated many economies, but it should also be an event from which we learn to cher­ish our loved ones more by spend­ing more time with them.</p>
