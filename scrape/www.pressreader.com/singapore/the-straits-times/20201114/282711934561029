    <p>• North Mace­do­nia are look­ing to play their hearts out af­ter qual­i­fy­ing for Euro 2020, the first ma­jor tour­na­ment i n the team’s 27-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond-half goal from 37-year-old Go­ran Pan­dev was enough to give them a 1-0 win away to Ge­or­gia in their play-off fi­nal on Thurs­day and se­cure their berth.</p>
    <p>The for­ward, his coun­try’s most capped player (114) and all-time lead­ing scorer (36), flicked the ball home in the 56th minute of a tense, scrappy match played on a slip­pery pitch and was in tears as his team cel­e­brated at the end.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia, also hop­ing to qual­ify for their first ma­jor tour­na­ment, lost their com­po­sure af­ter the goal and never threat­ened.</p>
    <p>North Mace­do­nia will face Aus­tria, the Nether­lands and Ukraine in Group C at Euro 2020, which has been post­poned un­til JuneJuly next year due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We will play for our na­tion’s pride in the Fi­nals,” said coach Igor An­gelovski. “Pan­dev scored a beau­ti­ful goal to take us through.”</p>
    <p>North Mace­do­nia qual­i­fied by what some re­gard as the back door, via the fourth divi­sion of</p>
    <p>Uefa’s in­au­gu­ral Na­tions League com­pe­ti­tion, but their play­ers were not go­ing to let that de­tract from their achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>“I am so happy. I’ve have played in a lot of games like this be­fore and I think my ex­pe­ri­ence helped the team to achieve this suc­cess,” said Pan­dev.</p>
    <p>In an­other play-off, Hun­gary came from be­hind to stun Ice­land 2-1 for their spot at Euro 2020.</p>
    <p>Two-time World Cup run­ner­sup Hun­gary will go into a tough Group F against World Cup hold­ers France, Ger­many and reign­ing Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two play-off fi­nals – North­ern Ire­land against Slo­vakia and Ser­bia against Scot­land – went to ex­tra time, with Slo­vakia win­ning 2-1 and Scot­land beat­ing Ser­bia 5-4 on penal­ties af­ter a 1-1 draw.</p>
