    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) grew at a sin­gle-digit pace last month af­ter a dou­ble-digit jump in the month be­fore.</p>
    <p>Ship­ments were driven mainly by non-elec­tronic goods such as non­mon­e­tary gold, spe­cialised ma­chin­ery and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals.</p>
    <p>Nodx rose 6 per cent year on year last month af­ter a re­vised 13.9 per cent ex­pan­sion in June and a 4.6 per cent drop in May, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The gain last month was higher than the 4.4 per cent jump pre­dicted by e c o n o mi s t s in a Bloomberg sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Nodx has now in­creased in five out of the seven months of this year, a ro­bust per­for­mance when com­pared with only one month of gain last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Irvin Seah, se­nior econ­o­mist at DBS Bank said: “This can be seen as the start of a nor­mal­i­sa­tion process, where ex­ports will flat­ten out to a more sus­tain­able level.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he noted, the global out­look re­mains highly un­cer­tain and chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>“While we be­lieve Nodx growth will remain pos­i­tive on an av­er­age ba­sis in the com­ing months, some gy­ra­tions could still be ex­pected from time to time. This is partly at­trib­uted to the volatile na­ture of the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal clus­ter, which is the key driver of over­all Nodx per­for­mance thus far,” he said.</p>
    <p>On a month-on-month sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, Nodx rose 1.2 per cent last month, af­ter the pre­vi­ous month’s 1.4 per cent de­cline. The growth in non-elec­tronic do­mes­tic ex­ports out­weighed the de­cline in elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>Nodx growth slowed down on a three-month mov­ing av­er­age yearon-year ba­sis as well. The in­crease av­er­aged 4.6 per cent last month af­ter the 5.9 per cent gain in June.</p>
    <p>On a year-on-year ba­sis, non-elec­tronic Nodx rose by 6.9 per cent last month, fol­low­ing the 11.7 per cent ex­pan­sion in the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>Con­tribut­ing the most to last month’s ex­ports gains, non-mon­e­tary gold ship­ments surged 227.9 per cent, spe­cialised ma­chin­ery rose 60.1 per cent and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals were up 15.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Last month’s gain in non-mon­e­tary gold ship­ments was aided by a low base in July last year when non­mon­e­tary gold ex­ports de­clined 3.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing gold, No­mura In­ter­na­tional said, Nodx would have con­tracted by 5.9 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>Gold ex­ports have soared and will con­tinue to do so this year due to the in­crease in de­mand for phys­i­cal bul­lion as a safe-haven as­set amid global eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fitch So­lu­tions re­cently re­vised up its 2020 gold forecast to US$1,850 per ounce com­pared with US$1,680 pre­vi­ously, af­ter mar­ket prices breached an all-time high of US$1,900 last month.</p>
    <p>ESG data showed gains in spe­cialised ma­chin­ery and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ex­ports were also helped by their low bases last year.</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic Nodx grew by 2.8 per cent last month, less than the low­base driven ex­pan­sion of 22.2 per cent in the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>Disk me­dia prod­ucts, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment and in­te­grated cir­cuit ship­ments in­creased by 23 per cent, 18.2 per cent and 1.5 per cent last month, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the low base for elec­tron­ics, ESG said do­mes­tic ex­ports of disk me­dia prod­ucts de­clined by 25 per cent in July last year amid the global elec­tron­ics down­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Still, elec­tron­ics, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and chem­i­cals ac­counted for 61 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s ex­ports last month and are likely to drive fu­ture growth.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee Ju Ye, econ­o­mist at Maybank Kim Eng Se­cu­ri­ties, said: “We re­it­er­ate our pos­i­tive out­look on ex­ports, as Sin­ga­pore rides on re­silient de­mand for elec­tron­ics, which is 22 per cent of Nodx, and pharma, which is 10 per cent of the to­tal.”</p>
    <p>She said man­u­fac­tur­ing will likely es­cape re­ces­sion as ex­ports and re­gional trade re­cover through this year.</p>
    <p>“The im­prov­ing per­for­mance of re­gional ex­port pow­er­houses in July, in­clud­ing China, Viet­nam, South Korea and Tai­wan, sig­nals an en­cour­ag­ing start to the third quar­ter,” she noted.</p>
    <p>Nodx to the top mar­kets as a whole grew last month, though ex­ports to In­done­sia, Thai­land, Hong Kong, China and the EU 27 de­clined.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports to China fell 5.1 per cent last month, af­ter a 0.6 per cent in­crease in June. Elec­tronic Nodx to the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy was down 16.3 per cent last month.</p>
    <p>The mar­kets that ac­counted for most of the growth in last month’s Nodx were led by the United States (+98.7 per cent), South Korea (+56.3 per cent) and Tai­wan (+18.7 per cent).</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic Nodx to the US surged 28.5 per cent last month, the most among Sin­ga­pore’s top 10 mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said the US had al­ready over­taken China as Sin­ga­pore’s top Nodx mar­ket based on the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>The US now has an 18 per cent share of Sin­ga­pore Nodx, com­pared with China’s 13.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>“This is a re­ver­sal of 2019, when China held pole po­si­tion with a mar­ket share of 17.3 per cent, while the US was in sec­ond place with 13.1 per cent,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment last week raised Sin­ga­pore’s 2020 trade fore­casts, pre­dict­ing Nodx to grow by 3 per cent to 5 per cent year on year, com­pared with an ear­lier forecast for a 1 per cent to 4 per cent fall.</p>
    <p>ESG said last Tues­day that its up­grade was based on the bet­terthan-ex­pected per­for­mance for spe­cific prod­ucts, such as non­mon­e­tary gold, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>But it cau­tioned that the global eco­nomic out­look re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Ex­port growth eases</p>
