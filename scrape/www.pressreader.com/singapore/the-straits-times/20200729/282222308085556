    <p>LAU­SANNE • The In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) Ath­letes’ Com­mis­sion is in the midst of a con­sul­ta­tion process on protests at the Olympic Games and will gather feed­back f rom ath­letes around the world.</p>
    <p>Its vice-chair Danka Bartekova said a sur­vey, due to be re­leased by the end of Oc­to­ber, will al­low the body to ob­tain re­sponses “di­rectly from the wider ath­lete com­mu­nity”, news site In­side The Games re­ported ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure has been mount­ing on the IOC to re­lax or abol­ish Rule 50, which bans any form of po­lit­i­cal, re­li­gious or racial protest dur­ing the Games, fol­low­ing world­wide demon­stra­tions over the death of Ge­orge Floyd in the United States.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the United States Olympic and Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee Ath­letes’ Ad­vi­sory Coun­cil and Global Ath­lete, an in­ter­na­tional ath­lete-led move­ment, have called for the change.</p>
    <p>In his New Year’s mes­sage, IOC pres­i­dent Thomas Bach in­sisted the qua­dren­nial event “must never be a plat­form to ad­vance po­lit­i­cal or any other po­ten­tially di­vi­sive ends”.</p>
    <p>He also stated his ob­jec­tion to the “grow­ing politi­ci­sa­tion of sport” as it “leads to no re­sult and just deep­ens ex­ist­ing di­vi­sions”.</p>
    <p>But t he I OC an­nounced last month that its Ath­letes’ Com­mis­sion would “have di­a­logue with ath­letes around the world to ex­plore dif­fer­ent ways for how Olympic ath­letes can ex­press their sup­port for the prin­ci­ples en­shrined in the Olympic Char­ter in a dig­ni­fied way”.</p>
    <p>IOC Ath­letes’ Com­mis­sion chair­man Kirsty Coven­try said last Oc­to­ber that most ath­letes do not feel podi­ums are the right plat­form to broad­cast their views.</p>
    <p>Bartekova, a bronze medal­list in shoot­ing at the 2012 Lon­don Olympics, said the sur­vey seeks in­put on tack­ling dis­crim­i­na­tion and what plat­forms ath­letes should be given dur­ing the Games to voice is­sues that are im­por­tant to them.</p>
    <p>At present, vi­o­la­tion of Rule 50 could lead to dis­ci­plinary ac­tion, in­clud­ing be­ing sent home from the Games.</p>
    <p>Protests are de­fined in the guide­lines as “dis­play­ing any po­lit­i­cal mes­sag­ing, in­clud­ing signs or arm­bands”, “ges­tures of a po­lit­i­cal na­ture, like a hand ges­ture or kneel­ing” and a “re­fusal to fol­low the Cer­e­monies pro­to­col”.</p>
    <p>Many ma­jor sports bod­ies in­clud­ing world foot­ball body Fifa have moved to al­low protests, and twotime Olympic triple jump cham­pion Chris­tian Tay­lor wants ath­letes to be able to do so peace­fully dur­ing the Games.</p>
    <p>“(Track) ath­letes are now see­ing what ath­letes are do­ing in other sports and think­ing, ‘We are not do­ing the same’,” the Amer­i­can told The Times of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“But we see (Formula One world cham­pion) Lewis Hamil­ton on TV every week­end mak­ing a stand and it’s a snow­ball ef­fect. Ath­letes are em­pow­er­ing other ath­letes. Other or­gan­i­sa­tions are stand­ing up too, but we can reach out to ath­letes and mag­nify their voice.”</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of KIN Part­ners Simon Oliveira, who has rep­re­sented Hamil­ton as well as other sports stars like David Beck­ham, Usain Bolt and Ney­mar, said the IOC risks look­ing out of touch if it main­tains a zero-tol­er­ance ap­proach.</p>
    <p>He told PR Week: “This is an avalanche that can’t be con­trolled.</p>
    <p>“Clearly the strength of feel­ing, on a global level, has per­suaded many leagues, fed­er­a­tions, gov­ern­ing bod­ies and brands as­so­ci­ated with sport to change their po­si­tion­ing and make com­mit­ments to en­sur­ing all voices are heard and sup­ported, mov­ing for­wards.”</p>
    <p>Some mem­bers of the Olympic cir­cle also do not see how Rule 50 can stand for much longer.</p>
    <p>Brian Lewis, pres­i­dent of the Trinidad and Tobago Olympic Com­mit­tee and the Caribbean As­so­ci­a­tion of Na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tees, told In­side The Games: “My strong view is that Rule 50 can’t stand scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>“It is ex­plic­itly linked to podium protests against racial in­jus­tices. It is the symp­tom of sys­temic racism and racial dis­crim­i­na­tion.”</p>
