    <p>An Air In­dia Ex­press plane, with 190 peo­ple on board, over­shot the run­way and plunged into a val­ley while land­ing at the Cali­cut In­ter­na­tional Air­port in the south­ern state of Ker­ala in heavy rain.</p>
    <p>Air In­dia Ex­press Flight IX 1344, which was com­ing in from Dubai, over­shot the run­way at the air­port – also known as the Kozhikode In­ter­na­tional Air­port – at 7.41pm, said the Min­istry of Civil Avi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Direc­tor-Gen­eral of Civil Avi­a­tion said in a state­ment that the “air­craft skid­ded off the run­way, crashed into a wall and then fell into a val­ley, split­ting into two”.</p>
    <p>In­dian me­dia re­ported that the pi­lot of the flight was among at least 11 peo­ple killed.</p>
    <p>There was no of­fi­cial con­fir­ma­tion on ca­su­al­ties even as res­cue op­er­a­tions were launched to pull out pas­sen­gers and rush them to nearby hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Vi­su­als broad­cast on tele­vi­sion showed that the Boe­ing 737 plane had split into two af­ter fall­ing into the val­ley.</p>
    <p>There were 174 pas­sen­gers, 10 in­fants, two pi­lots and four cabin crew on board the air­craft.</p>
    <p>Ker­ala Health Min­is­ter K.K. Shailaja said that those in­jured were rushed to hos­pi­tals in</p>
    <p>Kozhikode and Malap­pu­ram, and that some of the in­jured were in crit­i­cal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>In­dia has not thrown open in­ter­na­tional flight op­er­a­tions due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but has been op­er­at­ing mul­ti­ple repa­tri­a­tion flights, and has es­tab­lished air bub­bles with a hand­ful of coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Some 950,000 In­di­ans have re­turned home on the repa­tri­a­tion flights un­der the Vande Bharat Mis­sion, the Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs had said on Thursday.</p>
    <p>The south­ern state of Ker­ala has been hit by heavy mon­soon rains. At least 15 peo­ple were killed in land­slides ear­lier yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­ac­tions poured in from dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi tweeted: “Pained by the plane ac­ci­dent in Kozhikode. My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. May the in­jured re­cover at the ear­li­est.”</p>
    <p>Home Min­is­ter Amit Shah tweeted: “Dis­tressed to learn about the tragic ac­ci­dent of Air In­dia Ex­press air­craft in Kozhikode, Ker­ala. Have in­structed NDRF to reach the site at the ear­li­est and as­sist with the res­cue op­er­a­tions.” The NDRF is the Na­tional Dis­as­ter Re­sponse Force.</p>
    <p>Mr Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main op­po­si­tion Congress party and an MP for Wayanad in Ker­ala, said in a mes­sage: “I am shocked to hear about the crash land­ing of an Air In­dia Ex­press flight, com­ing from Dubai, at Kozhikode, Ker­ala... My thoughts are with the crew, the pas­sen­gers and their fam­i­lies and friends at this time.</p>
    <p>HELP ON THE WAY</p>
    <p>Dis­tressed to learn about the tragic ac­ci­dent of Air In­dia Ex­press air­craft in Kozhikode, Ker­ala. Have in­structed NDRF to reach the site at the ear­li­est and as­sist with the res­cue op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
