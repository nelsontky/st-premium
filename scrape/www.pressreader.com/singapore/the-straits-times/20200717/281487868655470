    <p>Teach­ers will have to en­gage stu­dents more deeply on is­sues re­lated to race and re­li­gion, es­pe­cially with stu­dents to­day hav­ing greater ex­po­sure to “Amer­i­can­ised” ideas, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung.</p>
    <p>It is through fa­cil­i­tat­ing such dis­cus­sions that there can be a re­spect­ful con­test of ideas, which will help stu­dents in­ter­nalise them, he said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was speak­ing to the me­dia yes­ter­day at Tampines Sec­ondary School, where he joined stu­dents to mark Racial Har­mony Day.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with gen­er­a­tions be­fore them, he said, young peo­ple to­day have a dif­fer­ent view of race and re­li­gion in that they de­sire in-depth con­ver­sa­tions about var­i­ous is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong noted that the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry is en­cour­ag­ing prin­ci­pals to cover such ground in school, in­clud­ing dur­ing char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion classes. More teach­ers are be­ing trained to spe­cialise in this and fa­cil­i­tate such dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple to­day have a dif­fer­ent view of race and re­li­gion as com­pared with older gen­er­a­tions, and con­ver­sa­tions in school play a big role in help­ing stu­dents nav­i­gate dif­fer­ences, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The gen­er­a­tion be­fore him had a tol­er­ant view to­wards di­ver­sity and co-ex­ist­ing, while his own gen­er­a­tion be­came more ac­cept­ing and ap­pre­cia­tive of other cul­tures.</p>
    <p>“But if you ask peo­ple of my gen­er­a­tion to sit down and have a con­ver­sa­tion (about sen­si­tive is­sues), it feels awk­ward, and al­most a bit em­bar­rass­ing and un­com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>“This gen­er­a­tion is dif­fer­ent. They ac­tu­ally want to talk about it. But they need fa­cil­i­ta­tion, and they are hon­est about it,” he said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter was speak­ing dur­ing a me­dia visit to Tampines Sec­ondary School yes­ter­day, where he joined stu­dents to com­mem­o­rate Racial Har­mony Day.</p>
    <p>Racial Har­mony Day falls on July 21, but as that day is dur­ing the one­week school midterm break, cel­e­bra­tions were brought for­ward.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion ( MOE) is en­cour­ag­ing prin­ci­pals to hold more in-depth con­ver­sa­tions in school, in­clud­ing dur­ing char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion classes.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Bud­get de­bate in March, it was an­nounced that schools would en­gage sec­ondary school stu­dents on con­tem­po­rary is­sues – such as bul­ly­ing, us­ing so­cial me­dia, and race and re­li­gion – fort­nightly.</p>
    <p>MOE is train­ing more teach­ers who can spe­cialise in this and can fa­cil­i­tate such dis­cus­sions, said Mr Ong. But he em­pha­sised that con­text mat­ters in dis­cussing race and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>“We are con­stantly un­der the in­flu­ence of Amer­i­can so­cial me­dia, Amer­i­can pop cul­ture, but we are not Amer­i­can. Our his­to­ries are to­tally dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>This will be a topic teach­ers will have to care­fully en­gage stu­dents on, he noted.</p>
    <p>“The start­ing point has got to be our own con­ver­sa­tions and di­a­logues. You are bound to dis­cover that stu­dents are read­ing things on the In­ter­net, get­ting ideas that are more ‘Amer­i­can­ised’, for ex­am­ple, and when you bring it up, then you can have a con­tes­ta­tion of ideas re­spect­fully, and then that is how stu­dents get to in­ter­nalise them.”</p>
    <p>Just send­ing them read­ing ma­te­rial is not go­ing to help, said Mr Ong, adding: “You need that en­gage­ment.”</p>
    <p>At Tampines Sec­ondary, teach­ers use con­ver­sa­tion cards and board games to en­gage stu­dents in dis­cus­sions on is­sues in­volv­ing race, re­li­gion, cul­ture and tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>In a Sec­ondary 3 class The Straits Times ob­served, stu­dents dis­cussed var­i­ous sce­nar­ios and how they would re­spond to them.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a given sce­nario was some­one be­ing sur­prised that a Malay stu­dent does well in math­e­mat­ics, and com­pli­ment­ing the stu­dent that “you are ac­tu­ally re­ally smart for a Malay”.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, stu­dents said this was a back­handed com­pli­ment with im­proper tone and hurt­ful phras­ing, as it sounded sar­cas­tic. They dis­cussed how they would let the per­son know that it could be of­fen­sive, with­out us­ing ag­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent Goh Sun-Jin, 15, said he has learnt to be more sen­si­tive about recog­nis­ing other peo­ple’s per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, our words may af­fect them harshly and they may not be brave enough to speak up,” he said, adding that his friend­ship with class­mates of dif­fer­ent eth­nic­i­ties – Filipinos, Malays and In­di­ans – has taught him much about dif­fer­ences in cul­tures.</p>
    <p>In a Sec­ondary 1 class, stu­dents took part in a quiz, with ques­tions such as which eth­nic group the game chap­teh – played with a weighted shut­tle­cock – is as­so­ci­ated with. A num­ber of stu­dents an­swered “Malay”, with a stu­dent ex­plain­ing “the word sounded Malay”.</p>
    <p>The teacher later re­vealed that the game has its ori­gins in China, and ad­vised stu­dents to avoid mak­ing as­sump­tions.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate visit, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion In­dra­nee Ra­jah joined pupils at Juy­ing Pri­mary School to mark Racial Har­mony Day.</p>
    <p>Across Sin­ga­pore, stu­dents were en­cour­aged to ap­pre­ci­ate the coun­try’s racial and cul­tural di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Given the safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place in schools, this year’s com­mem­o­ra­tive ac­tiv­i­ties largely took place through class­room-based ac­tiv­i­ties and dis­cus­sions in­stead of school- or co­hortwide events.</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING WITH THE TIMES</p>
    <p>If you ask peo­ple of my gen­er­a­tion to sit down and have a con­ver­sa­tion (about sen­si­tive is­sues), it feels awk­ward, and al­most a bit em­bar­rass­ing and un­com­fort­able. This gen­er­a­tion is dif­fer­ent. They ac­tu­ally want to talk about it. But they need fa­cil­i­ta­tion, and they are hon­est about it.</p>
