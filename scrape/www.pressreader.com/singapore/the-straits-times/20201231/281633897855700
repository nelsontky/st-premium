    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) pi­lot and a work pass holder have pre­lim­i­nar­ily tested pos­i­tive for the new B117 strain of the coro­n­avirus that is cir­cu­lat­ing in the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>They were among 27 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,569.</p>
    <p>The new B117 strain is re­port­edly 70 per cent more con­ta­gious, but has not shown signs of be­ing more lethal or se­vere.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot, a 40-year-old Sin­ga­porean man, had trav­elled to the United King­dom for work be­tween Dec 19 and 22, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Although he tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 upon re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore, he de­vel­oped a fever last Satur­day and sought med­i­cal treat­ment at a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clinic the next day, where he was swabbed and con­firmed pos­i­tive on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther tests will be con­ducted to con­firm the Covid-19 strain the man has.</p>
    <p>The work pass holder who also pre­lim­i­nar­ily tested pos­i­tive for the B117 strain is a 53-year-old man who re­turned from the United King­dom. He was con­firmed pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there were 24 other im­ported cases, all of whom had been placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Among the im­ported cases, three are Sin­ga­porean, four are per­ma­nent res­i­dents, five are work pass hold­ers and seven are work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Of the seven work per­mit hold­ers, six are for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>The im­ported cases also in­clude three de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers, one stu­dent pass holder, one long-term visit pass holder, one short-term visit pass holder and one spe­cial pass holder.</p>
    <p>The sole com­mu­nity case announced yes­ter­day is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who works as a ma­rine sur­veyor at Lloyd’s Reg­is­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As part of his job, the 46-year-old man works on board ves­sels docked at Sem­b­corp Ma­rine Ad­mi­ralty Yard.</p>
    <p>He had not gone to work since the on­set of symp­toms on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>His case is cur­rently un­linked and epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Bay Sands, IMM, Takashimay­a and Or­chard Gate­way were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of two cases in the past week which are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With 11 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,396 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 52 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 77 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
