    <p>Cap­tain Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang has vowed to be­come an Arse­nal “leg­end” after he ended spec­u­la­tion over his fu­ture by sign­ing a new three-year con­tract on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Gabon for­ward re­vealed he had com­mit­ted his fu­ture to Arse­nal in a live In­sta­gram stream from the Emi­rates Sta­dium, with over 100,000 peo­ple watch­ing via the of­fi­cial Arse­nal ac­count as he pledged to fol­low in the foot­steps of Thierry Henry, Den­nis Bergkamp and Ian Wright.</p>
    <p>“I have seen in­cred­i­ble play­ers, pas­sion­ate play­ers, In­vin­ci­ble play­ers,” the 31-year-old said. “I dream of be­ing one of them, among the best, and stay­ing in the hearts of the fans forever. I want to be­come an Arse­nal leg­end just like Thierry, Wrighty, (Tony) Adams and Bergkamp – too many to men­tion... I want to leave a legacy, this is where I be­long, this is my fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>He was joined on the call by team­mate Alexan­dre La­cazette and Wright, who praised his de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“Oth­ers have left us in the past but you stayed when we needed you most,” Wright said.</p>
    <p>The deal is re­ported to be worth £250,000 (S$440,000) a week, with bonuses that could take it be­yond the £350,000-per-week wages of top earner Me­sut Ozil.</p>
    <p>Aubameyang moved to Arse­nal from Borus­sia Dort­mund in Jan­uary 2018 and has scored 72 goals in 111 games in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>It is a ma­jor coup for Arse­nal to keep the Pre­mier League’s joint top scorer last year, with man­ager Mikel Arteta say­ing: “He’s an im­por­tant leader for the team and a big part of what we’re build­ing.”</p>
    <p>On the other side of north London, Tottenham Hot­spur are in talks with Real Madrid to re-sign their for­mer star Gareth Bale.</p>
    <p>The Wales for­ward has been frozen out by coach Zine­dine Zi­dane, play­ing just 32 per cent of avail­able min­utes in La Liga last sea­son. He has two years left on a con­tract that pays him around £600,000 per week and his wages are re­port­edly the big­gest hur­dle to a deal.</p>
    <p>“Gareth still loves Spurs,” Bale’s agent Jonathan Bar­nett told BBC Sport Wales on Tues­day. “We are talk­ing. It’s where he wants to go.”</p>
    <p>Bale, 31, left Tottenham for Real in 2013 for a then world record fee of £85 mil­lion.</p>
