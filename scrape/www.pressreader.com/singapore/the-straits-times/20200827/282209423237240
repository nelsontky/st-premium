    <p>Gam­ing com­pany Razer hopes to in­tro­duce a dig­i­tal bank­ing busi­ness over­seas even as it awaits the out­come of its ap­pli­ca­tion for a dig­i­tal full-bank li­cence here.</p>
    <p>The firm is as­sess­ing prospects across South-east Asia and other emerg­ing mar­kets such as In­dia and Latin Amer­ica as it seeks to ex­pand its fin­tech busi­ness, said Razer Fin­tech chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Li Meng.</p>
    <p>Its e-pay­ment sys­tem Razer Pay is al­ready avail­able in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who is also Razer’s chief strat­egy of­fi­cer, told a brief­ing yes­ter­day that the firm is well poised to de­velop a dig­i­tal bank­ing busi­ness as it is fa­mil­iar with the strict re­gional reg­u­la­tions sur­round­ing the dig­i­tal pay­ments busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He noted that some reg­u­la­tors are also lean­ing to­wards more “bank-like reg­u­la­tions”, adding: “So we are al­ready pre­pared from that per­spec­tive to put the right pro­cesses in place so that if we get the dig­i­tal bank­ing li­cence, we should be able to pivot very quickly from just be­ing a dig­i­tal pay­ments busi­ness to run­ning a dig­i­tal bank­ing plat­form.”</p>
    <p>Razer, which is based in Sin­ga­pore and Irvine, Cal­i­for­nia, has in­ter­ests in gam­ing hard­ware, soft­ware and ser­vices, as well as vir­tual gam­ing cred­its and fin­tech.</p>
    <p>Its up­date yes­ter­day came as it an­nounced first-half earn­ings.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong-listed com­pany posted a net loss of US$17.7 mil­lion ($24.2 mil­lion) in the six months to June 30, a 62.9 per cent im­prove</p>
    <p>We have demon­strated to MAS (the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore) that we will in­vest and com­mit to grow­ing the pie here but to also rep­re­sent Sin­ga­pore and grow a next-gen­er­a­tion bank out of the coun­try. ment from a net loss of US$47.7 mil­lion in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue was a record US$447.5 mil­lion – up 25.3 per cent – thanks to higher turnover from its hard­ware, soft­ware and ser­vices busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said that even if the firm gets a dig­i­tal full-bank li­cence here, it will con­tinue to look abroad for op­por­tu­ni­ties as the lo­cal bank­ing sec­tor is highly com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“We have demon­strated to MAS (the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore) that we will in­vest and com­mit to grow­ing the pie here but to also rep­re­sent Sin­ga­pore and grow a next-gen­er­a­tion bank out of the coun­try,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee noted that tra­di­tional banks “have taken decades to grow a busi­ness just in South-east Asia, but with a dig­i­tal bank, be­ing more nim­ble, we want to build a global busi­ness and lever­age the Razer Inc side of things as they grow along­side (the fin­tech busi­ness)”.</p>
    <p>Razer’s ven­ture into the bank­ing sec­tor is through a con­sor­tium that in­cludes Sheng Siong Hold­ings, tech firm LinkSure Global, au­to­mo­tive mar­ket­place Carro, in­surer FWD and In­signia Ven­tures Part­ners. Razer Fin­tech will own 60 per cent of the con­sor­tium.</p>
    <p>The MAS an­nounced in June last year that it would is­sue up to two dig­i­tal full-bank li­cences and three dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­cences, a move aimed at open­ing up the bank­ing in­dus­try to new com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>It noted in June this year that 14 of the 21 dig­i­tal bank ap­pli­ca­tions had met the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria and will go to the next stage of as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>The re­sults will be an­nounced later this year.</p>
