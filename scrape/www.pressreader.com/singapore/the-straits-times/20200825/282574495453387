    <p>When for­mer Hong Kong ac­tress Chingmy Yau took part in the Miss Hong Kong Pageant at the age of 19 in 1987, she was one of the favourites to win.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she was thwarted af­ter a mag­a­zine broke the news that she had cos­metic surgery on her chin, nam­ing one of the con­tes­tants, Ca­nary Wong, as the source.</p>
    <p>Yau ex­plained then that she had a fall when she was young and later had cor­rec­tive surgery, but she quit the com­pe­ti­tion even­tu­ally due to the pres­sure from the fall­out.</p>
    <p>The pageant was even­tu­ally won by Pauline Ye­ung, with Wong be­ing placed among the top 10.</p>
    <p>Now, 33 years later, Wong, 54, has clar­i­fied that she was not the one who leaked the news.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, she ap­peared on a talk show hosted by Wing Lam – who was the sec­ond run­ner-up then – and said she was to­tally un­aware of the mat­ter un­til the mag­a­zine story ran.</p>
    <p>Wong, who is known for play­ing Hong Kong su­per­star Andy Lau’s ex-girl­friend in the 1988 movie As Tears Go By, said it was a mis­un­der­stand­ing that she would tell on Yau to gain an ad­van­tage over her.</p>
    <p>“I ig­nored the mat­ter at that time as I thought it was ab­surd and I was also busy with the train­ing,” she said on the show.</p>
    <p>Wong only re­alised the sever­ity of the mat­ter on the night of the fi­nals, when her cousin called her to say that she had been cast in a bad light by the me­dia.</p>
    <p>She did not think much about it af­ter the pageant, as she be­gan to re­ceive in­vi­ta­tions to act in TV se­ri­als.</p>
    <p>“I do feel a tinge of re­gret not clar­i­fy­ing it at that time, as I would al­ways be men­tioned when­ever the mat­ter of Yau tak­ing part in the beauty con­test was brought up,” she added.</p>
    <p>Yau, 52, has so far not re­acted to Wong’s ex­pla­na­tion. The for­mer ac­tress, known for her sexy im­age in the late 1980s and 1990s, was once de­scribed as one of the four beauties of TVB to­gether with Ye­ung, El­iz­a­beth Lee and Lam, the top three winners of Miss Hong Kong 1987.</p>
    <p>Yau bowed out of the en­ter­tain­ment scene af­ter mar­ry­ing fash­ion mogul Sham Kar Wai in 1999. The cou­ple have three daugh­ters.</p>
