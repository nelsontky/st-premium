    <p>SEOUL • Hyundai Mo­tor units and its chair­man have agreed to buy an 80 per cent stake in robot-maker Bos­ton Dy­nam­ics from SoftBank Group for around 800 bil­lion won to 900 bil­lion won (S$1.1 bil­lion), a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter told Reuters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Hyundai can lever­age the robot tech­nol­ogy to ex­pand au­to­ma­tion at its unionised car fac­to­ries, as well as de­sign au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles like self-driv­ing cars, drones and de­liv­ery robots, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>The move comes af­ter newly pro­moted chair­man Chung Eui-sun pledged to re­duce re­liance on tra­di­tional car man­u­fac­tur­ing, say­ing robotics will ac­count for 20 per cent of the com­pany’s fu­ture busi­ness, with car­mak­ing tak­ing up 50 per cent, fol­lowed by ur­ban air mo­bil­ity at 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Chung will own a 20 per cent stake in Bos­ton Dy­nam­ics, while Hyundai Mo­tor and its af­fil­i­ates, Hyundai Mo­bis and Hyundai Glo­vis, will hold a 60 per cent stake, two peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the mat­ter is con­fi­den­tial. One of the sources con­firmed the value of the deal.</p>
    <p>Hyundai Mo­tor and SoftBank de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>“The ac­qui­si­tion would help Hyundai of­fer a seam­less ap­proach to goods de­liv­ery with the help of de­liv­ery robots and driverless ve­hi­cles such as cars and planes,” said Mr Koh Tae-bong, an an­a­lyst at Hi In­vest­ment and Se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>“But Hyundai needs to prove that Bos­ton Dy­nam­ics can be com­mer­cially suc­cess­ful and is ca­pa­ble of com­pet­ing with cheaper Chi­nese ri­vals,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bos­ton Dy­nam­ics’ prod­ucts, which in­clude Spot, a four-legged dog-like robot that can climb stairs, have gained me­dia at­ten­tion even as the firm has strug­gled to build a com­mer­cial busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Bos­ton Dy­nam­ics, which was spun out from the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy in 1992, was bought by Google in 2013 and sold to SoftBank in 2017.</p>
    <p>Its clients in­clude Ford Mo­tor, which leased two Spot robots in</p>
    <p>July as part of a pilot pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Last year, Ford said it was part­ner­ing Agility Robotics, a maker of walk­ing robots, as it de­signs a planned fleet of self-driv­ing de­liv­ery vans that will drop pack­ages at the doorsteps of peo­ple’s homes.</p>
    <p>Hyundai Mo­tor was ex­pected to an­nounce the ac­qui­si­tion yes­ter­day, af­ter get­ting ap­proval from the boards at each of the three units, two other peo­ple have said.</p>
    <p>The deal is the lat­est pull­back by SoftBank from op­er­at­ing busi­nesses as chief ex­ec­u­tive Masayoshi Son fo­cuses on in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>It also marks the fad­ing of SoftBank’s robotics am­bi­tions, which were talked up by Mr Son, and leaves the group’s robotics busi­ness look­ing in­creas­ingly iso­lated.</p>
    <p>For Hyundai, this is the lat­est in a flurry of deals un­der Mr Chung, who pledged to trans­form the car­maker into a mo­bil­ity provider, amid threats from Tesla and tech firms with ride-shar­ing, self-driv­ing and other tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Mo­bil­ity con­sul­tant Cha Doowon said: “Car­mak­ers are in an in­no­va­tion race. Hyundai is a late­comer to the race, and it seems that they want to show­case that they can do it, rather than try­ing to gen­er­ate money from the robots busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Hyundai Mo­tor has de­vel­oped a wear­able robot to re­duce fa­tigue for factory work­ers and ran pilot pro­grammes at its US plants.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, it an­nounced it had part­nered Uber to de­velop elec­tric air taxis, but the US firm said ear­lier this week that it would sell its loss-mak­ing fly­ing taxi unit to Joby Avi­a­tion.</p>
