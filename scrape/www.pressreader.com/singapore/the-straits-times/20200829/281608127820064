    <p>So­cial me­dia post­ings hit­ting out at some banks and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, for their hir­ing prac­tices which ap­peared to favour some na­tion­al­i­ties ahead of Sin­ga­pore­ans, have been do­ing the rounds.</p>
    <p>Some of the com­men­ta­tors, how­ever, have been lax about factcheck­ing or en­sur­ing that their posts re­flect re­al­ity. Oth­ers have made mis­lead­ing or even false claims.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, one post in­cluded a photo pur­port­edly taken in a DBS Bank of­fice here which showed a large num­ber of non-Sin­ga­porean work­ers pos­ing with its chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Piyush Gupta.</p>
    <p>An­other post in­cluded a photo pur­port­edly taken at DBS’ IT depart­ment at the bank’s Asia Hub in Changi Busi­ness Park.</p>
    <p>Both proved to be false. The bank clar­i­fied in a Face­book post on Aug 15 that the images were taken in its In­dia of­fice and not in Sin­ga­pore, as the posts ap­peared to sug­gest.</p>
    <p>The first photo was posted on DBS In­dia’s Face­book page three years ago, on Sept 5, 2017, when the bank was cel­e­brat­ing the open­ing of a new of­fice in Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>The event was at­tended by Mr Gupta as well as In­dian cricket star Sachin Ten­dulkar, who was col­lab­o­rat­ing with DBS to en­rich the lives of chil­dren through sports.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond photo was taken at an ap­pli­ca­tion se­cu­rity con­fer­ence held at DBS Asia Hub 2 in Hy­der­abad a year ago.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted and asked by The Straits Times about the post he cre­ated and whether he had made any ef­forts to ver­ify the source of the im­age, busi­ness­man Den­nis Lim replied by ask­ing why he should have to do such checks.</p>
    <p>He added that he has con­tacts who are bank staff and who have ex­pressed con­cerns about the large num­ber of ex­pa­tri­ates at Changi Busi­ness Park.</p>
    <p>That, ap­par­ently, was suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to back his views in his post, even if the photo was a mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion and used out of con­text.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the man­ag­ing direc­tor of a re­cruit­ment firm posted on his Face­book page a photo col­lage of LinkedIn pro­files to show how some man­age­ment po­si­tions at Stan­dard Char­tered Bank in Sin­ga­pore were filled by staff of one na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>It was posted by Mr Vic­tor Teoh, 51, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Re­cruitPlus Con­sult­ing, who has been in hu­man re­sources for over 10 years.</p>
    <p>In his post, he re­counted how a friend who used to work for the bank would at­tend meet­ings where he was the only Chi­nese present. He also ques­tioned if some bank roles re­quired skills that lo­cals do not have. “Is it be­cause we don’t have lo­cal bank­ing tal­ent?”</p>
    <p>Asked about his post, he told ST he re­lied only on pub­lic in­for­ma­tion, such as that on LinkedIn, to ver­ify the claims.</p>
    <p>He added: “We are not say­ing that for­eign­ers should not come in.</p>
    <p>“But if there is a dom­i­nance of a cer­tain na­tion­al­ity, then that would be an is­sue, es­pe­cially right now when we are los­ing jobs.”</p>
    <p>Th­ese and other posts – ques­tion­ing why th­ese for­eign­ers were hired over lo­cals – were widely cir­cu­lated. Some of the posts re­main on­line, de­spite the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions de­bunk­ing their claims.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered’s state­ments on the mat­ter have high­lighted the fact that a ma­jor­ity of its em­ploy­ees are lo­cals, no dif­fer­ent from many ma­jor fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions here.</p>
    <p>The bank said ear­lier this month that Sin­ga­pore­ans form 70 per cent of its head­count of 10,000, and cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents to­gether form 83 per cent of its work­force.</p>
    <p>It said: “The bank has in­vested heav­ily in groom­ing Sin­ga­porean lead­ers – 70 per cent of its Sin­ga­pore man­age­ment team are</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans.” The bank added that it also has many Sin­ga­pore core lead­ers across global and re­gional roles, with 140 Sin­ga­pore­ans posted over­seas.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore told The Straits Times it heard the views and con­cerns of Sin­ga­pore­ans who have spo­ken up on the is­sue of lo­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tion in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>It also said the prop­a­ga­tion of false­hoods by some in­di­vid­u­als is unhelpful for an in­formed dis­cus­sion on th­ese is­sues, and un­fair to the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions con­cerned as well as to the for­eign­ers who work here and con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
