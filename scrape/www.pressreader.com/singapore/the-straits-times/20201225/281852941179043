    <p>(Florida) • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Wed­nes­day granted par­dons to former cam­paign chair­man Paul Manafort and former ad­viser Roger Stone, sweep­ing away the most im­por­tant con­vic­tions un­der the long-run­ning Rus­sia elec­tion probe.</p>
    <p>He also is­sued a par­don for Mr Charles Kush­ner, a real es­tate de­vel­oper and fa­ther of Mr Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kush­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, tak­ing ad­van­tage of a right granted by the Con­sti­tu­tion only to the pres­i­dent, has is­sued two lots of par­dons in as many days, and more are an­tic­i­pated as he faces the end of his pres­i­dency on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>The par­dons quickly trig­gered a fierce back­lash. Among those par­doned were se­cu­rity guards con­victed of killing 14 civil­ians in a 2007 Bagh­dad mas­sacre.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, Mr Trump is­sued par­dons for 26 in­di­vid­u­als, and com­muted part or all of the sen­tences of an ad­di­tional three peo­ple. A com­mu­ta­tion re­moves the pun­ish­ment but leaves the con­vic­tion in place.</p>
    <p>Of spe­cial in­ter­est for Mr Trump has been at­tack­ing the re­sults of US Spe­cial Coun­sel Robert Mueller’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Rus­sian med­dling in the 2016 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign, a case Mr Trump has re­peat­edly dis­missed as a po­lit­i­cal witch hunt.</p>
    <p>Re­act­ing to the par­dons, Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Ben Sasse said: “This is rot­ten to the core.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides Mr Manafort and Mr Stone, Mr Trump has par­doned two other ma­jor fig­ures from the Rus­sia probe, former na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Michael Flynn and former ad­viser George Pa­padopou­los.</p>
    <p>The Manafort par­don spared the long-time Repub­li­can op­er­a­tive from serv­ing the bulk of his 71/ 2- year prison term. Mr Manafort, 70, was among the first in Mr Trump’s in­ner cir­cle to face charges brought by Mr Mueller.</p>
    <p>Mr Manafort worked on Mr Trump’s cam­paign for five months in 2016. In 2018, Mr Trump called him a “brave man” for not co­op­er­at­ing with fed­eral au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Stone was con­victed in Novem­ber last year by a Wash­ing­ton jury of ly­ing un­der oath to law­mak­ers in­ves­ti­gat­ing Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence in the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Kush­ner was sen­tenced to two years in prison af­ter plead­ing guilty in 2004 to 18 counts of tax eva­sion, wit­ness tam­per­ing and mak­ing un­law­ful cam­paign do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Iraqis ex­pressed out­rage and sad­ness af­ter Mr Trump de­liv­ered par­dons to the four Black­wa­ter se­cu­rity con­trac­tors who were con­victed of mur­der and man­slaugh­ter six years ago for the Nisour Square mas­sacre.</p>
    <p>The four, all former US ser­vice­men, opened fire un­pro­voked on the crowded square in 2007, in an in­ci­dent that left at least 14 civil­ians dead – though the Iraqi au­thor­i­ties put the toll as high as 17 – while wound­ing dozens more.</p>
    <p>“I knew we’d never get jus­tice,” Iraqi po­lice of­fi­cer Fares Saadi, who led the in­ves­ti­ga­tions, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>In a tweet, re­tired US gen­eral Mark Hertling, who served in Iraq, called the Black­wa­ter par­dons “egre­gious and dis­gust­ing”.</p>
