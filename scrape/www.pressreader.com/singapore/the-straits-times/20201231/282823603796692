    <p>Robert Ro­driguez is the rare film­maker who makes both stylishly vi­o­lent films for adults and whole­some chil­dren’s movies.</p>
    <p>So the man re­spon­si­ble for the blood, sex and gore in hor­ror flick From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) and the Sin City crime an­thol­ogy (2005 to 2014) also di­rected the Spy Kids ad­ven­ture come­dies (2001 to 2011).</p>
    <p>He put on his kid-friendly hat to write and di­rect the new Net­flix su­per­hero ca­per We Can Be He­roes, a fol­low-up to his 2005 movie The Ad­ven­tures Of Shark­boy And Lav­a­girl.</p>
    <p>And he took the un­usual step of work­ing with his own chil­dren to come up with the screen­play and score.</p>
    <p>We Can Be He­roes, which stars Pe­dro Pas­cal and YaYa Gos­selin as father and daugh­ter he­roes, sees alien in­vaders kid­nap­ping earth’s su­per­heroes, forc­ing their chil­dren to team up and save the world.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times and other press in a video call from his home in Austin, Texas, Ro­driguez, 52, re­veals that the im­pe­tus for this film came from Net­flix it­self.</p>
    <p>The stream­ing ser­vice “came to me and said: ‘We love your fam­ily films, like Spy Kids and The Ad­ven­tures Of Shark­boy And Lav­a­girl. They do re­ally well on our ser­vice – kids watch them over and over again. But they’re very rare: no one does these live-ac­tion kids’ movies’”.</p>
    <p>“I love mak­ing those movies,” says the di­rec­tor, whose break­out fea­ture was El Mari­achi (1992), a low-bud­get Span­ish-lan­guage western.</p>
    <p>But as chil­dren tend to re­peat­watch those films at home, “no one re­ally knew how suc­cess­ful those movies re­ally were be­cause they didn’t help our box of­fice, so it didn’t make busi­ness sense to make a lot of them”.</p>
    <p>The ad­vent of Net­flix and the boom in at-home movie view­ing, es­pe­cially dur­ing the pan­demic, changed all that.</p>
    <p>And just as he did on the first in­stal­ment, Ro­driguez roped in some of his five chil­dren, aged 15 to 25, to write the script and cre­ate the mu­sic.</p>
    <p>“I wanted it to be a fam­ily mak­ing a fam­ily movie for other fam­i­lies,” he ex­plains. “I’m from a fam­ily of 10 kids and I have five of my own, and fam­ily has al­ways been im­por­tant to me – even though I have the du­al­ity of be­ing a ‘fam­ily guy’ and then the guy mak­ing movies like Sin City.”</p>
    <p>Now that his chil­dren “are all old enough, we’re all work­ing to­gether any­way”, says Ro­driguez, whose for­mer wife El­iz­a­beth Avel­lan, 60, also pro­duces some of his movies.</p>
    <p>“So we came up with what su­per­pow­ers kids would have, and 11 of them made it into the movie.”</p>
    <p>As­pects of Ro­driguez’s fam­ily life made it into the story as well. His daugh­ter Rhiannon, 15, in­spired four char­ac­ters, in­clud­ing the leader of the chil­dren, Missy (Gos­selin), whose father is su­per­hero Marcus (Pas­cal).</p>
    <p>“My daugh­ter’s nick­name is Missy. And she sings and is al­ways draw­ing and mak­ing faces, so she in­spired the three kid su­per­heroes whose pow­ers i nvolve singing, draw­ing and mak­ing faces.</p>
    <p>“And she drew all the drawings you see in the movie in real time on the set for me.”</p>
    <p>His re­la­tion­ship with Rhiannon is a lot like the one be­tween Pas­cal’s and Gos­selin’s char­ac­ters, he adds. “And I wanted to have a record of that re­la­tion­ship, be­cause I’m sure there are other fa­thers and daugh­ters we can in­spire with this.”</p>
    <p>To di­rect the large cast of chil­dren, Ro­driguez drew on his ex­pe­ri­ences wran­gling kids in his own ex­tended fam­ily, and con­sciously worked to build the young ac­tors’ trust in him and them­selves.</p>
    <p>“We ig­nite their cre­ativ­ity and self-con­fi­dence so they see that they’re more tal­ented than they thought and see them­selves ac­com­plish­ing greater things.</p>
    <p>“And that mim­ics the theme of the movie, which is that our kids will be bet­ter than us – we just have to men­tor them prop­erly and they will take over the world.”</p>
    <p>He saw the same growth in his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>His son Rebel, 21, had writ­ten mu­sic for some of his low-bud­get and short films, but never an or­ches­tral score. “So I told him I wanted him to work on this with me be­cause I wanted him to learn how to write for an orches­tra.</p>
    <p>“And he ended up writ­ing the whole score be­cause the mu­sic he wrote was so el­e­vated and com­pli­cated, I couldn’t match him.”</p>
    <p>We Can Be He­roes is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
