    <p>MADRID • Badly hit by the pan­demic and care­fully watch­ing the lat­est out­breaks, Spain paused yes­ter­day to hon­our its tens of thou­sands of vic­tims at a state cer­e­mony joined by top EU and World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The me­mo­rial took place barely three weeks af­ter Spain ended its months-long state of emer­gency. How­ever, since then, there have been a grow­ing num­ber of new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, with health chiefs mon­i­tor­ing more than 120 ac­tive out­breaks.</p>
    <p>So far, the virus has of­fi­cially claimed 28,413 lives in Spain, mak­ing it the sev­enth worst-hit coun­try in the world.</p>
    <p>“To­day, we are sym­bol­i­cally say­ing good­bye to moth­ers, fa­thers, chil­dren, sib­lings, friends: We take their hands, ca­ress their cheek, kiss their fore­head and re­mem­ber their glance in our hearts,” Mr Her­nando Calleja, who lost his brother in April, said in an ad­dress at the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Presided over by Spain’s King Felipe VI, the me­mo­rial took place in a square out­side the Royal Palace in the pres­ence of be­reaved fam­i­lies and a host of top Euro­pean Union and WHO of­fi­cials, with an orches­tra play­ing Sa­muel Bar­ber’s Ada­gio For Strings.</p>
    <p>“This act can­not heal the pain felt by so many fam­i­lies at not be­ing at the side of their loved ones in their fi­nal hours... but what it can do is pay trib­ute to their lives, to their con­tri­bu­tion to our so­ci­ety, to their mem­o­ries,” the King said.</p>
    <p>For months, tens of thou­sands of doc­tors and nurses have been en­gaged in the front-line bat­tle against the virus, which at its peak, pushed Spain’s health­care sys­tem to the brink of col­lapse.</p>
    <p>“It has been very hard, we have felt pow­er­less in the face of a cruel sense of un­cer­tainty... we have given ev­ery­thing and worked to the limit of our strength,” Nurse Aroa Lopez, from Barcelona, said at the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Among those at­tend­ing were EU Coun­cil head Charles Michel, Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen, Euro­pean Par­lia­ment leader David Sas­soli and top EU diplo­mat Josep Bor­rell.</p>
    <p>Nato chief Jens Stoltenber­g and WHO head Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus were also present.</p>
    <p>In late May, the gov­ern­ment held a 10-day mourn­ing pe­riod for the vic­tims – the long­est since Spain re­turned to democ­racy af­ter the fall of the Franco dic­ta­tor­ship in 1975.</p>
