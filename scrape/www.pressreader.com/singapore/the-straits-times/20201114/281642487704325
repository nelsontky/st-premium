    <p>Ten mosques yes­ter­day be­gan of­fer­ing ad­di­tional spa­ces for wor­ship­pers to per­form their con­gre­ga­tional prayers as part of a pi­lot project.</p>
    <p>An­nounced at the start of this month, the move will see the mosques serv­ing 450 wor­ship­pers across three ses­sions ev­ery Fri­day – at 12.45pm, 1.45pm and 2.45pm.</p>
    <p>One-third of that num­ber, or 150, will be split up into three zones of up to 50 peo­ple for each ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Con­gre­gants en­ter­ing the mosques un­der the pi­lot must check in us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken.</p>
    <p>All re­li­gious groups have also been al­lowed to con­duct ser­vices of up to 100 peo­ple since Oct 3, with con­gre­gants split into zones of up to 50 each to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>But Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Min­is­ter Ed­win Tong said on Sept 26 that a pi­lot of wor­ship ses­sions of up to 250 par­tic­i­pants would be con­ducted for those that have safely con­ducted ser­vices for 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing was calm and or­derly yes­ter­day at the three prayer zones at the Maarof Mosque in Jurong West, one of the 10 mosques un­der the pi­lot, as con­gre­gants used the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken to check in, be­fore en­ter­ing and per­form­ing their prayers.</p>
    <p>They also had their tem­per­a­ture taken with hands-free scan­ners, and each zone had sev­eral staff mem­bers or vol­un­teers on standby to as­sist.</p>
    <p>Be­fore en­ter­ing, wor­ship­pers had to show staff and vol­un­teers sta­tioned out­side the mosque that they had se­cured a slot us­ing an elec­tronic con­fir­ma­tion slip they would have re­ceived af­ter book­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>All the wor­ship­pers had their own mats for prayers to en­sure that their face did not come phys­i­cally into con­tact with the floor of the mosque when pray­ing. There was no shak­ing of hands, and many in­stead opted for the “Salam Mufti” in which one places a hand on the chest to con­vey greet­ings.</p>
    <p>Af­ter each prayer ses­sion, staff were seen clean­ing the zones with dis­in­fec­tant ma­chines and wip­ing down com­mon touch points like rail­ings and pil­lars.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Rashid, a sys­tems and com­mer­cial of­fi­cer at a lo­gis­tics com­pany, was one of the wor­ship­pers in the first slot at the Maarof mosque. The 44-year-old was im­pressed by how or­gan­ised and smooth the process of en­ter­ing the mosque with TraceTo­gether was. Prior to yes­ter­day, he had used his iden­tity card to check into mosques.</p>
    <p>“I feel grate­ful that the slots have been in­creased to 150 now be­cause it gives more of us a chance to do our prayers. Us­ing the TraceTo­gether took some ad­just­ment, but it is ac­tu­ally okay for me,” he said.</p>
    <p>The 10 mosques par­tic­i­pat­ing in the pi­lot are Al-Is­lah, Al-Istigh­far and Darul Ghufran in the east, AnNur, Assyafaah and Yu­sof Ishak in the north, An­gul­lia and Sul­tan in the south and Al-Khair and Maarof in the west.</p>
    <p>The aim of the pi­lot by the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) is to even­tu­ally in­crease the cur­rent limit to 250 peo­ple at each ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters yes­ter­day, the ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Maarof Mosque, Us­taz Rashid Ramli, de­scribed the on­go­ing pi­lot as a good sign, adding that he hopes con­gre­gants will con­tinue to down­load and use the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>“We hope that with all the safe mea­sures in place, we can en­sure that our mosques are places which are safe to come to,” he said.</p>
