    <p>The world may have shrunk for stay-home glo­be­trot­ters but they can al­ways whirl around Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Spin around town in a vin­tage Vespa side­car on the Crazy Rich Asians route – or ex­plore the hip-her­itage Blair Plain en­clave on foot.</p>
    <p>Try a new mur­der-mys­tery-game tour in Chi­na­town – or step back in time at the last kam­pung, wide-eyed Gen Al­pha kids in tow.</p>
    <p>With the phase two re­open­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, tours have re­sumed since July, this time for dis­cern­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans cu­ri­ous about hy­per-lo­cal jour­neys.</p>
    <p>Mr Si­mon Wong, co-founder of the Sin­ga­poreSide­cars tour agency and social en­ter­prise, reck­ons that his vin­tage Vespa side­car tours are distinc­tive enough to ap­peal to cit­i­zens, who made up 25 per cent of his pre-Covid-19 clien­tele.</p>
    <p>“We dis­cov­ered hap­pily that many Sin­ga­pore­ans have not re­ally ex­plored Sin­ga­pore,’’ says the Bri­tish­born Hong Konger.</p>
    <p>“It’s also a hu­man thing. Grow­ing up, I spent my time ex­plor­ing else­where but not London. It is easy for Sin­ga­pore­ans to hop else­where.”</p>
    <p>This is a good time to mul­ti­ply lo­cal tour con­tent, he says, now that most Sin­ga­pore­ans are stay­ing home.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Sin­ga­pore­ans re­main cau­tious about trav­el­ling: More than a third polled by dig­i­tal travel plat­form Agoda say they will travel with con­fi­dence only when a vaccine is found.</p>
    <p>This fig­ure rises to 44 per cent for the cau­tious cohort of Gen Zs, Agoda an­nounced last Wednesday.</p>
    <p>Agoda’s coun­try di­rec­tor for Sin­ga­pore, Ms Gi­u­liana Ri­itano, says: “There is so much to re­dis­cover, from ex­plor­ing dif­fer­ent neigh­bour­hoods to sim­ply in­dulging in that deca­dent lit­tle bit of lux­ury that ho­tels pro­vide.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ex­pe­ri­ences and tours listed on Agoda in­clude batik paint­ing classes, photo-walks in Lit­tle In­dia and a World War II trail in Changi by coach.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, for team bond­ing or safe dis­tanc­ing, Airbnb Ex­pe­ri­ences has a slate of on­line ex­pe­ri­ences such as sound­bath med­i­ta­tion and curry cook­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Parin Me­hta, di­rec­tor (Asia-Pa­cific) of Airbnb Ex­pe­ri­ences, says some Sin­ga­pore-hosted virtual events have proved pop­u­lar lo­cally, such as the Bor­ing In­dian Curry Work­shop and Cock­tail Cabi­net aka Mix it like a Pro.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that this trend is a tes­ta­ment not only to Sin­ga­pore­ans’ love af­fair with food, but also their com­mit­ment to sup­port­ing lo­cal busi­nesses,” he says. Com­pa­nies also book on­line ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>“The in­ter­ac­tive na­ture of the ex­pe­ri­ences, con­ducted from home, meet a real need for com­pa­nies look­ing to build rap­port and col­lab­o­ra­tion in re­mote teams,” adds Mr Me­hta.</p>
    <p>Choices abound for ur­ban ex­plor­ers.</p>
    <p>No need to dust off the pass­port. Here are six lo­cal tours – span­ning the edgy and ed­u­ca­tional – that re­veal Sin­ga­pore afresh.</p>
