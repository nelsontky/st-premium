    <p>Pu­lau Ubin seafood restau­rant Cheong Lian Yuen went from be­ing wor­ried about its fu­ture af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic killed al­most all vis­its to the is­land to now stress­ing over whether it can ac­com­mo­date the num­ber of peo­ple flock­ing there.</p>
    <p>A fea­ture on the is­land for more than 60 years, it has seen busi­ness in­crease by three times since the end of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in June.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh Jun Kang, 27, the third­gen­er­a­tion owner, said: “When Covid-19 first hit, busi­ness was ac­tu­ally re­ally bad. We had to close our shop for two to three months.</p>
    <p>“But right now it is re­ally full dur­ing the week­ends, even on the week­days.”</p>
    <p>With in­ter­na­tional travel re­stricted, the is­land has drawn Sin­ga­pore­ans in droves, es­pe­cially now, with the school hol­i­days in full swing.</p>
    <p>And it is not just Pu­lau Ubin that is at­tract­ing vis­i­tors. The South­ern Is­lands have also be­come an “over­seas” hot spot as more in Sin­ga­pore take to be­ing tourists in their own coun­try.</p>
    <p>Vis­its to na­ture re­serves, gar­dens and parks have seen a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease, the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Ubin, with its ru­ral kam­pung charm and na­ture trails, has seen vis­i­tor­ship spike, with about 47,000 peo­ple trav­el­ling to the is­land last month, com­pared with the av­er­age of 25,000 vis­i­tors for past Novem­bers, NParks said.</p>
    <p>Of the 50 peo­ple on the is­land whom The Sun­day Times polled on Fri­day, 48 were not both­ered by the num­ber of vis­i­tors there.</p>
    <p>They said com­mu­nity case num­bers were low in Sin­ga­pore and added that vis­i­tors were all don­ning masks as well.</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple were ob­served to fol­low the rules, keep­ing their masks on, es­pe­cially when in the town cen­tre. And since it was the school hol­i­days, there were many fam­i­lies with chil­dren.</p>
    <p>How­ever, groups of more than five did gather in some ar­eas, such as at the in­for­ma­tion kiosk, to buy drinks from the vend­ing ma­chine.</p>
    <p>The 15-minute bum­boat ride from Changi Point Ferry Ter­mi­nal to the is­land costs $4 each way.</p>
    <p>Weather per­mit­ting, busi­ness has been brisk, said a boat­man who de­clined to be named. He cur­rently makes an av­er­age of seven to eight boat trips with pas­sen­gers on week­days, and slightly above 10 on week­ends.</p>
    <p>Boats leave the Changi jetty ev­ery few min­utes, each fer­ry­ing about 10 to 12 pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>At the Changi jetty, queue posts and mark­ers re­mind peo­ple to keep a safe dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said his restau­rant makes it a point to en­sure that peo­ple ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing rules. Din­ers are kept to five a ta­ble, with 1m spa­ces be­tween the 13 ta­bles.</p>
    <p>“If there is a large group, we don’t think we will ac­cept their</p>
    <p>busi­ness. We will apol­o­gise to them, ex­plain the sit­u­a­tion and ask them to re­turn in smaller groups... It is not worth the risk.”</p>
    <p>Shop owner Madam Ng, 70, who did not give her full name, lives on the is­land and makes a liv­ing by sell­ing drinks and snacks.</p>
    <p>She said that busi­ness has not only re­turned, but im­proved.</p>
    <p>“When more peo­ple visit the place, we will get more cus­tomers,” she said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer Jas­bir Singh, 54, who vis­ited the is­land on Fri­day for the sec­ond time in a week, said he wanted to ex­pe­ri­ence its kam­pung vibe.</p>
    <p>“I usu­ally travel to the United States, but now with Covid-19 in full swing, it is a good chance for me to ex­plore Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Cer­line Yeo, 42, who works in the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor, was vis­it­ing the is­land for the first time to­gether with her fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>“I’m not very wor­ried about the crowds – the is­land is big enough to ac­com­mo­date ev­ery­one, and we</p>
    <p>came on a week­day,” she said.</p>
    <p>Other than bik­ing and walk­ing to scenic spots like Chek Jawa, vis­i­tors have also been rent­ing vans on the is­land for a quick ride to their des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tor of such a ser­vice, who wanted to be known only as Mr Ong, said there are at least 10 vans that vis­i­tors can book.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old, who has lived on the is­land for more than 10 years, said he moved there to en­joy a less stress­ful pace of life. He re­turns to the main­land once or twice a month.</p>
    <p>He said he does not mind the higher foot­fall now.</p>
    <p>“There are more peo­ple now but it is not a big deal. The is­land be</p>
    <p>comes quiet again at night when most leave,” he said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Jiok Hang, 72, was vis­it­ing the is­land with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“The air is fresher. I want to be in an en­vi­ron­ment that is dif­fer­ent from the city,” he said.</p>
    <p>While he has trav­elled over­seas sev­eral times, it was his first time on Ubin.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways wanted to come here and fi­nally got the chance to,” he said.</p>
