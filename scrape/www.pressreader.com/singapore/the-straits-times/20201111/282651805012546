    <p>In the eyes of Bri­tish celebrity baker Paul Hol­ly­wood, Ja­pan is “all about rice and noo­dles”.</p>
    <p>Cue the crit­i­cism when his three­part se­ries Paul Hol­ly­wood Eats Ja­pan de­buted in Bri­tain in April, where the me­dia largely panned it as “racist” for his lack of knowl­edge of Ja­panese food and cul­ture. The show airs on BBC Life­style (StarHub Chan­nel 432) and BBC Player (on de­mand).</p>
    <p>In a 15-minute Zoom in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Hol­ly­wood, 54, says: “I had no pre­con­cep­tions about the food in Ja­pan. Ja­pan and China are rice-based cul­tures, not wheat. So I was fas­ci­nated to see how far the bread cul­ture – tech­ni­cally from the West – has come to the East.”</p>
    <p>It is clear in the show that Hol­ly­wood, a judge on pop­u­lar re­al­ity tele­vi­sion se­ries The Great Bri­tish Bake Off (2010 to present), is not fa­mil­iar with Ja­pan’s ob­ses­sion with per­fect bakes – he is “gob­s­macked” by the qual­ity of bread at Ginza estab­lish­ment Kimu­raya 1869, fa­mously known as the home of an­pan (red bean bun).</p>
    <p>The show – filmed last year – marks Hol­ly­wood’s first time in</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, where he spent three weeks eat­ing his way through the foodie des­ti­na­tion. He goes from touristy spots such as the pop­u­lar Ichi­ran ra­men chain – where he calls the chain’s solo din­ing ar­range­ment an “alien con­cept for a so­cia­ble Brit” like him­self – to feast­ing on a deca­dent 11-course kaiseki meal at Ky­oto’s three-Miche­lin-starred restau­rant Kikunoi.</p>
    <p>So take it as a novice’s view of Ja­pan, from some­one who has not re­ally vis­ited this part of the world, in­clud­ing Aus­tralia, China, Thai­land and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood says: “Ja­pan has just been slightly too far for me. I mostly travel around Europe and Rus­sia is the ‘most East’ I’ve been so far.</p>
    <p>“I still have a lot of places to go.” He counts the eel tem­pura at</p>
    <p>Tokyo’s Tsuna­hachi restau­rant as the best thing he ate dur­ing the trip, and the worst be­ing tofu – which he de­scribes to have the “tex­ture of a slug”.</p>
    <p>When asked how tofu ranks in terms of worst foods he has eaten, Hol­ly­wood laughs and says: “It is not as far down as you think. It’s not that bad and I’m just play­ing it up a bit. But it’s not some­thing I’ll go for as there’s no real flavour un­less you mar­i­nate it. I like big, strong flavours.”</p>
    <p>Aside from food, his Ja­pan ex­pe­ri­ence in­cluded meet­ing samu­rais and sumo wrestlers, as well as gamely dress­ing up as a Ninja Tur­tle for go-kart­ing.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther edi­tions of the show could see him head to coun­tries such as Aus­tralia and Rus­sia – sub­ject to the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He hopes to re­turn to Ja­pan by next year. “I found out that ev­ery­thing they do is to the best of their abil­ity. My ex­pe­ri­ence was the best of the best, and I fell in love with the peo­ple, cul­ture and food.”</p>
