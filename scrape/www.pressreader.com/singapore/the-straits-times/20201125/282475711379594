    <p>LON­DON • Pep Guardi­ola has com­mit­ted to Manch­ester City for the long term but for the first time in his man­age­rial ca­reer, re­sults may de­ter­mine his fu­ture rather than his de­sire for a new chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>City’s board showed how fully com­mit­ted they re­main to the Guardi­ola project by ex­tend­ing his con­tract to 2023 last week.</p>
    <p>There is good rea­son for the club’s faith. Guardi­ola is re­spon­si­ble for two of the three high­est point tal­lies in Premier League his­tory among six ma­jor tro­phies in his first four sea­sons in charge.</p>
    <p>But a 2-0 de­feat by Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur on Satur­day that left City eight points off the top of the ta­ble con­tin­ued the malaise that has set in since the be­gin­ning of last sea­son.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola’s men are lan­guish­ing in 13th in the Premier League ta­ble, al­beit with a game in hand. A re­turn of 12 points from their open­ing eight games of the cam­paign is the low­est since 2008-2009.</p>
    <p>City even have a neg­a­tive goal dif­fer­ence af­ter scor­ing just 10 times – and con­ced­ing 11 – in the league, their low­est at this stage of the sea­son since 2006-07, when they fin­ished 14th un­der Stuart Pearce. They have also scored 17 fewer af­ter eight games than last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is we are strug­gling to score goals this sea­son,” ad­mit­ted Guardi­ola. “Ten goals in eight games is not good enough.”</p>
    <p>The Cham­pi­ons League has nor­mally been the nadir of his time in Manch­ester. In four sea­sons, he has not even been able to match City’s best run in the com­pe­ti­tion – a trip to the semi-fi­nals un­der Manuel Pel­le­grini in 2015-16.</p>
    <p>So far this sea­son, Europe has been a blessed re­lief as the English side have swept aside Porto, Mar­seille and Olympiakos to take a firm grip on Group B. Another vic­tory at Olympiakos today will guar­an­tee qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the last 16 for the eighth suc­ces­sive sea­son.</p>
    <p>But City have done lit­tle to sug­gest they have learnt from the mis­takes that have re­peat­edly cost them in the knock­out stages of the Cham­pi­ons League once the level of op­po­si­tion im­proves.</p>
    <p>The man­ner of de­feat by Spurs was al­most an ex­act replica of the 2-0 vic­tory for Jose Mour­inho’s men when the sides last met in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Over the two matches at the Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur sta­dium, the vis­i­tors had 41 at­tempts on goal with­out scor­ing, while Spurs net­ted with four of their five shots on tar­get.</p>
    <p>Lyon, Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino’s Tot­ten­ham, Liver­pool and Monaco have also cracked the City code in the Cham­pi­ons League by de­fend­ing deep and counter-at­tack­ing at speed.</p>
    <p>But Guardi­ola re­mains con­fi­dent City will soon start scor­ing goals, even af­ter he said he would not rush Ser­gio Aguero back into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian striker, City’s all-time top scorer with 373 goals, in­jured his ham­string at West Ham last month, only a week af­ter mak­ing his first start of the sea­son fol­low­ing knee surgery. He was an un­used sub­sti­tute in the loss to Spurs.</p>
    <p>“We have scored in two sea­sons more than 100 goals. Eighty or 90 per cent of the play­ers are the same, es­pe­cially up front,” Guardi­ola added.</p>
    <p>What seems to have changed is what City do – or do not do – when they are with­out the ball. The in­tense press to get the ball back of the City sides that ac­cu­mu­lated 198 Premier League points in two sea­sons be­tween 2017 and 2019 has gone. With­out it, even an in­cred­i­bly ex­pen­sive ar­ray of tal­ented in­ter­na­tion­als are too easy to play through.</p>
    <p>City’s back four of Joao Cancelo, Aymeric La­porte, Ruben Dias and Kyle Walker plus goal­keeper Eder­son cost a com­bined £265 mil­lion (S$474.1 mil­lion) and were still shred­ded by the guile of Harry Kane and the pace of Son He­ung­min and Steven Berg­wijn.</p>
    <p>Un­usu­ally for one of foot­ball’s great­est coaches, Guardi­ola now finds him­self in the un­charted ter­ri­tory of hav­ing to re­build a sec­ond great side at the same club.</p>
    <p>The early signs have not been promis­ing.</p>
    <p>I don’t think counter-at­tacks are the big prob­lem, I think the flu­id­ity to at­tack is the tar­get that we and I have to im­prove to know ex­actly what we have to do.</p>
    <p>PEP GUARDI­OLA, Manch­ester City man­ager, re­veal­ing the key is­sue he needs to ad­dress dur­ing his press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
