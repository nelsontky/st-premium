    <p>The econ­omy has prob­a­bly bot­tomed out, but there’s still a long way to go be­fore a re­cov­ery ap­pears on the hori­zon or the jobs sit­u­a­tion re­turns to any­where near nor­mal.</p>
    <p>That’s the main take­away from the sec­ond-quar­ter gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) num­bers re­leased yes­ter­day, com­bined with the first-ever jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port.</p>
    <p>The GDP growth num­bers for the sec­ond quar­ter were ex­pected to be bleak but they have turned out even bleaker than the ad­vance es­ti­mates re­leased last month had in­di­cated.</p>
    <p>On a year-on-year ba­sis, the econ­omy con­tracted 13.2 per cent, com­pared with 12.6 per cent as per the ear­lier es­ti­mates, while the quar­ter-on-quar­ter con­trac­tion on a sea­son­ally ad­justed annualised ba­sis was 42.9 per cent, even steeper than the 41.2 per cent fore­cast pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>These un­usu­ally dis­mal num­bers – and par­tic­u­larly the out­sized quar­ter-on-quar­ter de­cline – are largely a re­flec­tion of the cir­cuit breaker, which lasted from April 7 to June 1 and brought large parts of the econ­omy to a vir­tual stand­still, par­tic­u­larly the con­struc­tion sec­tor and sev­eral ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Bar­ring a reim­po­si­tion of the cir­cuit breaker – which, we can now be cau­tiously op­ti­mistic is un­likely to hap­pen – the econ­omy should start to re­bound in the sec­ond half of the year, as some pent-up de­mand reap­pears.</p>
    <p>But a re­bound from a low base should not be con­fused with a re­cov­ery – the econ­omy is still go­ing to end up with neg­a­tive growth this year – mi­nus 7 per cent to mi­nus 5 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the re­vised fore­cast.</p>
    <p>As the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try cau­tioned, the out­look re­mains clouded by a weak ex­ter­nal eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment which will weigh on many ex­port-re­lated in­dus­tries; a slower than ex­pected re­open­ing of in­ter­na­tional bor­ders, which will keep sec­tors such as tourism and avi­a­tion all but shut­tered; and labour short­ages in sec­tors such as con­struc­tion that are highly de­pen­dent on for­eign work­ers, who ac­count for most of the Covid-19 in­fec­tions so far, and many of whom have yet to re­sume work.</p>
    <p>Added to this list are other un­cer­tain­ties such as the pos­si­bil­ity of new waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, which have oc­curred even in coun­tries that were be­lieved to have con­trolled the pan­demic; the ratch­et­ing up of US-China ten­sions, which have spilled into ar­eas be­yond trade and could fur­ther de­press eco­nomic sen­ti­ment; an ac­cel­er­a­tion of de-glob­al­i­sa­tion and more dis­rup­tions to sup­ply chains; and the pos­si­bil­ity of the global eco­nomic cri­sis spread­ing to the bank­ing and fi­nan­cial sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, even when economies re­open, con­sumer be­hav­iour as well as cor­po­rate in­vest­ment is likely to re­main re­strained, which would limit the pos­i­tive im­pact – and this could be true of Sin­ga­pore too.</p>
    <p>This gloomy eco­nomic prog­no­sis is bad news for the job mar­ket. As the jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port cau­tions, “soft­ness in the labour mar­ket is likely to per­sist with con­tin­ued weak­ness in hir­ing and pres­sure on com­pa­nies to re­trench”.</p>
    <p>So the un­em­ploy­ment rate which climbed from 2.4 per cent in the first quar­ter to 2.9 per cent in the sec­ond will likely rise fur­ther, de­spite in­ten­si­fied ef­forts to per­suade em­ploy­ers to re­trench only as a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the weak econ­omy, two fac­tors could weigh on the job mar­ket in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>One is the fact that re­trench­ments tend to lag pe­ri­ods of un­usu­ally low eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, which sug­gests that much of the im­pact of the cir­cuit breaker on com­pa­nies dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter will show up in the job mar­ket only in the sec­ond half of the year.</p>
    <p>The other is that for most com­pa­nies, the wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme – which have prob­a­bly pre­vented thou­sands of re­trench­ments – will ex­pire this month.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has in place sev­eral ini­tia­tives to deal with re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre­piece is the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age, un­der which the Gov­ern­ment plans to cre­ate around 100,000 new po­si­tions, in­clud­ing jobs, trainee­ships and ap­pren­tice­ships.</p>
    <p>By the end of last month, the National Jobs Coun­cil – which had its first meet­ing only in June – had al­ready cu­rated about 92,000 op­por­tu­ni­ties com­mit­ted by both the public and pri­vate sec­tors – a com­mend­able achieve­ment in such a short time, given the cir­cum­stances. About 24,000 job seek­ers have al­ready been placed.</p>
    <p>But the data sug­gests that there will be chal­lenges to over­come.</p>
    <p>One is the fact that more than 70 per cent of the 92,000 com­mit­ted op­por­tu­ni­ties – both in the public and pri­vate sec­tors – are for PMETs. How­ever, the bulk of the re­trench­ments are likely to be work­ers in the hard­est-hit ser­vice sec­tors, such as restau­rants, re­tail, trans­port, tourism, avi­a­tion and events. A high pro­por­tion of these are likely to be non-PMETs. So, look­ing ahead, there will be a need for more non-PMET po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>While most of the 24,000 job place­ments so far have in­deed gone to non-PMETs, about 60 per cent of these are for short-term jobs (of up to 12 months).</p>
    <p>This is be­cause, as the jobs re­port pointed out, in the ini­tial phase, the fo­cus was on plac­ing job seek­ers to han­dle the surge in Covid-19-re­lated is­sues. But that phase will pass.</p>
    <p>While it is en­cour­ag­ing that some new jobs for non-PMETs are emerg­ing in ar­eas such as ware­house lo­gis­tics, hos­pi­tal­ity and de­liv­ery ser­vices, more will need to be done for this group in par­tic­u­lar.</p>
    <p>An­other chal­lenge re­lates to job match­ing. Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo al­luded to this when she pointed out that in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, some com­pa­nies in elec­tron­ics and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing are still hir­ing. How­ever, most of the lay­offs have been con­cen­trated in the ser­vice sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo ac­knowl­edged that there could be mis­matches in de­mand and sup­ply, not­ing that some job seek­ers “may not have thought about such jobs/in­dus­tries that they are not fa­mil­iar with or feel that the level is not quite what they are look­ing for”. She urged job seek­ers to con­sider such new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>This is prag­matic ad­vice, but it would need both job seek­ers and com­pa­nies to step out of their com­fort zones: Job seek­ers would have to ad­just their ex­pec­ta­tions and pre­pare for ca­reer shifts, while com­pa­nies would need to change their tra­di­tional hir­ing prac­tices, step up train­ing – for which sub­si­dies may be avail­able – and re­design jobs.</p>
    <p>But even if job seek­ers and com­pa­nies, draw­ing on all avail­able help, make these dif­fi­cult ad­just­ments, there is still a good chance that thou­sands of work­ers will end up in­vol­un­tar­ily un­em­ployed, per­haps for pro­longed pe­ri­ods, de­pend­ing on how the pan­demic pans out.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has in­di­cated that it is pre­pared to do more and has the means. Cush­ion­ing the blow to the un­em­ployed who can­not find jobs de­spite ev­ery­one’s best ef­forts should be one of the pri­or­i­ties go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>Bar­ring a reim­po­si­tion of the cir­cuit breaker... the econ­omy should start to re­bound in the sec­ond half of the year, as some pent-up de­mand reap­pears.</p>
    <p>But a re­bound from a low base should not be con­fused with a re­cov­ery – the econ­omy is still go­ing to end up with neg­a­tive growth this year – mi­nus 7 per cent to mi­nus 5 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the re­vised fore­cast.</p>
    <p>The data sug­gests that there will be chal­lenges to over­come. More than 70 per cent of the 92,000 com­mit­ted op­por­tu­ni­ties are for PMETs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the bulk of the re­trench­ments are likely to be work­ers in the hard­est-hit ser­vice sec­tors, such as restau­rants, re­tail, trans­port, tourism, avi­a­tion and events. A high pro­por­tion of these are likely to be non-PMETs.</p>
