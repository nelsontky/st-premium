    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES In the West­ern Con­fer­ence, the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers’ big­gest ob­sta­cle to reach­ing their sec­ond suc­ces­sive Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals is ex­pected to come from a Los An­ge­les Clip­pers team ea­ger to hit the re­set but­ton fol­low­ing a shock sec­ond-round play-off exit last sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers, led by two-time NBA Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard and fel­low All-Star Paul Ge­orge, have named Ty­ronn Lue as head coach, charg­ing him with sort­ing out team chem­istry and steer­ing the squad to a maiden ti­tle like he did with the Cleve­land Cava­liers in 2016.</p>
    <p>On the sur­face, they are a tal­ented group whose ros­ter is un­ri­valled by any other team ex­cept for the Lak­ers. But last sea­son deep di­vi­sions were ex­posed.</p>
    <p>They have since fired coach Doc Rivers and brought in last year’s NBA Cham­pi­onship-win­ning cen­tre Serge Ibaka from the Toronto Rap­tors to re­place Sixth Man of the Year Mon­trezl Har­rell, who left to join the Lak­ers. Ibaka should make for a more ver­sa­tile Clip­pers’ front court, of­fer­ing rim pro­tec­tion, floor spac­ing, and perime­ter de­fence and his 38.5 per cent con­nec­tion from deep last sea­son will also help the of­fence.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers’ bench l ed the league in scor­ing, av­er­ag­ing 50.3 points per game last term, and although they lost Landry Shamet and Rod­ney McGruder, for­ward</p>
    <p>Ni­co­las Ba­tum and guard Luke Ken­nard are solid ad­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Ge­orge, whose “Play-off P” nick­name be­came a meme af­ter he strug­gled in the post-sea­son, is hop­ing to re­store his rep­u­ta­tion as one of the league’s best for­wards.</p>
    <p>“The way I was be­ing used – Doc was try­ing to play me as a Ray Allen or a J.J. Redick, all pin-downs. I can do it, but that ain’t my game,” he told the All The Smoke pod­cast last week. “I need some flow, some mixes of pick-and-rolls, I need some post-ups, just dif­fer­ent touches.”</p>
    <p>In the East­ern Con­fer­ence, fans will fi­nally get to see Kevin Du­rant (right) play along­side Kyrie Irv­ing and, if he is fully re­cov­ered and stays healthy, the Brook­lyn Nets should prove to be a se­ri­ous threat to the Mil­wau­kee Bucks and last term’s NBA Fi­nal­ists Mi­ami Heat.</p>
    <p>The last time Du­rant was seen on a court, he was leav­ing the 2019 NBA Fi­nals with a torn Achilles ten­don. He left the Golden State War­riors to join the Nets that sum­mer but has yet to play a com­pet­i­tive game for Brook­lyn.</p>
    <p>The Nets have never won the NBA Cham­pi­onship and they have a rookie coach in Steve Nash. But hopes are high of a deep post-sea­son run. Be­cause of the short­ened sea­son, the Nets will not have the lux­ury of time to gel, so Spencer Din­wid­die and Caris LeVert, the two long­est-serv­ing play­ers on the ros­ter and en­ter­ing their fifth sea­son with the team, will have key roles to ful­fil.</p>
    <p>The Bucks have been the team to beat in the past two reg­u­lar sea­sons, twice fin­ish­ing with the league’s best record, only to choke in the play-offs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the fu­ture of Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo, the win­ner of the past two Most Valu­able Player awards, cleared up the team can press for­ward with con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Mil­wau­kee have also strength­ened their sta­tus as con­tenders af­ter their block­buster trade to ac­quire Jrue Hol­i­day, one of the NBA’s best two-way guards, from the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans.</p>
    <p>The All-Star is con­fi­dent he can help his new team “get over the hump”.</p>
    <p>“I think I fit in per­fectly,” he told the Wis­con­sin State Jour­nal. “Some­body that can also at­tack the bas­ket and get other peo­ple open. On the de­fen­sive end, that’s go­ing to be our big­gest strength. It’s go­ing to be hard for peo­ple to score on us.”</p>
