    <p>LON­DON/BRUS­SELS • De­spite the mount­ing pres­sure for eco­nomic rescue pack­ages to be used to tackle cli­mate change, most of the money spent so far on over­com­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has gone to­wards prop­ping up busi­ness as usual, ac­cord­ing to three stud­ies.</p>
    <p>But what comes next might be more im­por­tant for the cli­mate, as govern­ments move from emer­gency mode and start plan­ning – and spend­ing – for a post-Covid-19 re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“There are a l ot of dif­fer­ent groups who are watch­ing whether stim­u­lus ef­forts are go­ing to help or hurt the cli­mate,” said Mr Joel Jaeger, research as­so­ci­ate at the World Re­sources In­sti­tute in Washington DC. “They are all com­ing to the same con­clu­sion: the re­sponse so far has not been very green.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has al­ready prompted the United States, Europe, China, Ja­pan and oth­ers to com­mit tril­lions in stim­u­lus funds, with fur­ther colos­sal in­jec­tions ex­pected within 18 months.</p>
    <p>To cli­mate ad­vo­cates, these pack­ages rep­re­sent a once-in-a-gen­er­a­tion chance to shift the world onto a l ow-car­bon path by back­ing projects – such as re­new­ables, ef­fi­cient build­ings and electric ve­hi­cles – to re­duce heat-trap­ping car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tiana Figueres, a for­mer United Na­tions cli­mate chief who co-founded the en­vi­ron­men­tal plat­form Global Op­ti­mism, has called stim­u­lus spend­ing “the last op­por­tu­nity” to achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris cli­mate ac­cord. “The scale is such that it will de­ter­mine the con­tours of the global econ­omy over the next few decades.”</p>
    <p>In the ini­tial re­sponse, govern­ments fo­cused on blunt­ing the im­pact of the pan­demic, which sent bil­lions of peo­ple into lock­down and en­dan­gered the earn­ings of nearly half the global work­force, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>That meant fun­nelling large amounts of money into high-pol­lut­ing main­stays of the pre-pan­demic econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Group of 20 coun­tries have so far com­mit­ted at least US$151 bil­lion (S$210 bil­lion) to sup­port­ing fos­sil fuel-heavy sec­tors, such as air­lines, coal, oil and gas, and road­build­ing, ac­cord­ing to an En­ergy Pol­icy Tracker data­base launched last week by a group of research in­sti­tutes and cam­paign­ers.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, US$89 bil­lion had been com­mit­ted to green en­ergy, the data­base showed.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate study, con­sul­tancy Vivid Eco­nomics found that stim­u­lus pack­ages across 17 sig­nif­i­cant economies will pump about US$3.5 tril­lion into sec­tors that have big im­pacts on na­ture, but largely fail to use the money to pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Ad­vo­cates of “green re­cov­er­ies” are now lob­by­ing govern­ments to pivot, en­cour­aged by early sup­port for some cli­mate-friend­lier stim­u­lus in Ger­many, France and South Korea, and US states such as New York and Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>“We want to in­flu­ence the re­cov­ery and there is still a win­dow of op­por­tu­nity,” said Dr Ivetta Gerasim­chuk, a Geneva-based pol­icy ex­pert at the In­ter­na­tional In­sti­tute for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Europe has emerged as the leader in green re­cov­ery poli­cies, al­though its plans have faced crit­i­cism from some cam­paign­ers for still fall­ing short of what is needed to limit the rise in av­er­age global tem­per­a­tures in line with Paris tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union states have so far de­voted 0.31 per cent of the bloc’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) to some form of green spend­ing, rel­a­tive to an av­er­age of 0.01 per cent of GDP in Asia and North Amer­ica, ac­cord­ing to a third study by Bloomberg New En­ergy Finance.</p>
    <p>EU lead­ers are try­ing to clinch a deal on a mas­sive €750 bil­lion (S$1.19 tril­lion) pan­demic re­cov­ery fund. The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive arm, says all spend­ing from the fund must “do no harm” to its cli­mate goals, al­though some re­searchers cau­tion that safe­guards are weak.</p>
    <p>A €130 bil­lion pack­age un­veiled by Ger­many last month aims to boost electric ve­hi­cles and the use of clean hy­dro­gen fuel.</p>
    <p>France has pledged €15 bil­lion in near-term cli­mate spend­ing, plus €8 bil­lion to help elec­trify its au­to­mo­tive in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Italy and Bri­tain are sup­port­ing green build­ing ren­o­va­tions, while Switzer­land and Aus­tria have sought to at­tach en­vi­ron­men­tal cri­te­ria to air­line bailouts.</p>
    <p>While cam­paign­ers are pin­ning their hopes on the EU to set an ex­am­ple, prospects in the world’s two big­gest car­bon-emit­ting economies – China and the US – are less cer­tain.</p>
    <p>China has ap­proved five new coal plants and is ex­pected to rely on en­ergy-in­ten­sive in­fra­struc­ture and heavy in­dus­try to re­boot its econ­omy, al­though of­fi­cials also ex­tended sub­si­dies for electric cars.</p>
    <p>In the US, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has handed re­lief to oil and gas com­pa­nies and cur­tailed en­vi­ron­men­tal reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>But Demo­crat Joe Bi­den, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s op­po­nent in Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, has pledged to spend US$2 tril­lion over four years on clean en­ergy in­fra­struc­ture and would likely face pres­sure to do more.</p>
    <p>“There will be a need for a sus­tained stim­u­lus for at least two or three years,” said Dr Mark Paul, an econ­o­mist at New Col­lege of Florida. “It’s not one shot and done.”</p>
