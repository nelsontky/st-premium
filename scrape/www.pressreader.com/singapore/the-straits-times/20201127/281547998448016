    <p>Sin­ga­pore-born ac­tor Ross But­ler (above) is set to ap­pear in Swim­ming With Sharks, Shazam! 2 and To All The Boys 3 – with many other projects in the pipe­line – and is mak­ing his mark in Hol­ly­wood. He says he is done with play­ing Asian geeks or mar­tial artists, and wants to en­gi­neer change.</p>
    <p>It has been quite a jour­ney for Ross But­ler, who dropped out of his en­gi­neer­ing de­gree course and made the bold de­ci­sion to move to Los An­ge­les 10 years ago, when he was 20.</p>
    <p>Ex­ud­ing a quiet con­fi­dence through­out our tele­phone con­ver­sa­tion, the Sin­ga­pore-born, Vir­ginia-raised ac­tor says: “I didn’t know I wanted to be an ac­tor. I just wanted to change the en­vi­ron­ment I was in be­cause I felt stuck and just re­ally un­happy.”</p>
    <p>His choice did not sit well with his mother, who wanted him to take the aca­demic path.</p>
    <p>“My mum and I stopped talk­ing for a few years be­cause she didn’t ap­prove of the move,” But­ler, 30, says. “I was also mov­ing to a town that I had been to only once be­fore, so I didn’t have any friends or a sup­port sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>He made his first foray i nto act­ing when he turned 21, thanks to a friend who bought him an act­ing class for US$25. Once he de­cided act­ing was what he was go­ing to fo­cus on – it was some­thing he “im­me­di­ately con­nected with” – there was no stop­ping him.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up not only as a for­eigner but also mixed-race in the United States – his mother is Chi­nese-Malaysian and his fa­ther English-Dutch – he could never fully re­late to any­one.</p>
    <p>“You don’t re­ally feel like you be­long. You don’t feel like you have peo­ple you can lean on or who un­der­stand what you’re go­ing through. It was iso­lat­ing,” he says. “I be­came a so­cial chameleon. I got re­ally good at fit­ting the mould of who I thought peo­ple saw me as.”</p>
    <p>He turned to film as a means of es­cape, but it did not help that most avail­able roles played into Asian stereo­types and that movie stars were mostly white.</p>
    <p>This was an is­sue that con­tin­ued to plague Hol­ly­wood when he started out as an ac­tor and he made it his mis­sion early in his ca­reer to chal­lenge the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>Af­ter au­di­tion­ing to play mar­tial arts or geeky char­ac­ters that he did not res­onate with, he told his team to stop sending him for stereo­typ­i­cal Asian roles.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t get as many au­di­tions, but as soon as I started get­ting the ones I wanted to do, I was able to show what I could do. The first few years were tough.”</p>
    <p>But­ler is of the opin­ion that there are two bat­tles be­ing fought when it comes to Asian rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Hol­ly­wood – Asians get­ting on screen and Asians play­ing nonAsian roles.</p>
    <p>He is more fo­cused on the lat­ter. “I be­lieve i n in­te­gra­tion and in­clu­sion,” he says, “where we don’t have movies that put Asians in their own group. The world is mix­ing more and more. These sto­ries aren’t be­ing told enough.”</p>
    <p>In 2015, he landed what he calls his break­through role as Brett Wil­lis in Dis­ney’s K.C. Un­der­cover, star­ring Zen­daya.</p>
    <p>Then, he played Reg­gie Man­tle in Riverdale and Zach Dempsey in Net­flix’s 13 Rea­sons Why, with the lat­ter gar­ner­ing him break­out star­dom and an ar­dent so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing.</p>
    <p>He re­calls wak­ing up to a few hun­dred thou­sand new In­sta­gram fol­low­ers a day when the first sea­son of 13 Rea­sons Why aired.</p>
    <p>“I’d also get mes­sages from peo­ple say­ing how much the show af­fected them – that’s when I re­ally knew we had done what we set out to do,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“It was some­thing we thought we were pre­pared for, but weren’t. To have the work ap­pre­ci­ated by so many peo­ple was amaz­ing.”</p>
    <p>Fast-for­ward to to­day and his fan base in­cludes 8.4 mil­lion In­sta­gram fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Rem­i­nisc­ing about the mas­sively pop­u­lar and con­tro­ver­sial se­ries (it ended its four-sea­son run in June), which touches on top­ics such as sui­cide and men­tal health, he says “this was the first cast I’ve re­ally be­come a fam­ily with – we grew up to­gether”.</p>
    <p>“A l ot of them are like my younger sib­lings. We went through so much to­gether and we got to talk about things that hadn’t been talked about be­fore. We blazed the trail for shows such as Eu­pho­ria to ad­dress real is­sues – that’s some­thing spe­cial I think a lot of ac­tors don’t get to do.”</p>
    <p>But­ler is one the show’s old­est cast mem­bers.</p>
    <p>He con­sid­ers Dempsey his favourite char­ac­ter and re­lates to him on many lev­els.</p>
    <p>“Zach is the clos­est to who I am as a per­son. He has this jock la­bel on him, but he isn’t that. The feel­ing of be­ing mis­un­der­stood is some­thing I’ve felt my en­tire life.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing played high-school stu­dents – typ­i­cally jocks – for about seven years, the self-con­fessed video-game nerd is look­ing to ex­pand his reper­toire. He is es­pe­cially in­ter­ested in action-comedy roles such as his adult Eu­gene Choi char­ac­ter in superhero flick Shazam! (2019).</p>
    <p>“I’m ready to move on be­cause I like va­ri­ety. I’d love to play a Chris Pratt or Ryan Reynolds that isn’t Asian – ob­vi­ously, the race can be Asian, but it doesn’t need to be a mar­tial artist or a Ja­panese swords­man. At the end of the day, I want to have roles in which I can have fun and dig into,” he says.</p>
    <p>He also has his eye on get­ting into the pro­duc­tion side of things.</p>
    <p>To that end, he has been ex­plor­ing the art of im­pact­ful sto­ry­telling dur­ing his time in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>He says: “There are two movies and a tele­vi­sion se­ries I’ve been de­vel­op­ing. Hope­fully, they’ll get picked up. I want to use metaphors and al­le­gories to con­vey lessons – I think that’s the only way you can re­ally get peo­ple to un­der­stand a con­cept if they aren’t part of the les­son.”</p>
    <p>When he is not on set, he likes to keep him­self phys­i­cally and men­tally ac­tive. Be­sides hit­ting the gym, he has picked up ten­nis again and is ob­sessed with golf. He grew up play­ing it com­pet­i­tively.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to tak­ing lessons in Ja­panese and Ara­bic – he also picked up Mandarin a year ago – the self-taught guitarist is learn­ing to play the har­mon­ica.</p>
    <p>If that is not enough to make fans swoon, he also sings and plays the pi­ano.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been branching out into dif­fer­ent gen­res for the in­stru­ments I can play,” he says. “I’ve picked up jazz for pi­ano. I en­joy the im­pro­vi­sa­tional as­pect of it.”</p>
    <p>Trawl through his In­sta­gram feed and you will find clips that show­case his mu­si­cal chops. “I take songs I like and in­ter­pret them dif­fer­ently,” he says. “I do a lot of bal­lad cov­ers of elec­tronic dance mu­sic songs on gui­tar.”</p>
    <p>While But­ler l oves mu­sic, a ca­reer change is not on the cards. He does, how­ever, want to work on some deep house mu­sic with his DJ friends.</p>
    <p>An­other thing he is pas­sion­ate about is an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Last year, he launched a line of Tshirts fea­tur­ing rescue dogs and the word “un­con­di­tional” in sup­port of Best Friends An­i­mal So­ci­ety, a no-kill an­i­mal shel­ter and non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion in the US.</p>
    <p>He also uses his platform – where he of­ten shares pho­tos of him­self and his beloved dogs – to raise aware­ness of spe­cial causes.</p>
    <p>It is clear he sees him­self on a con­tin­ued path of learn­ing and is open to new ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>“Now that I’m be­ing taken a bit more se­ri­ously in this in­dus­try, I can’t be afraid to ask ques­tions, I can’t be afraid to look like I’m new at some­thing. I’ve learnt to just do it and not judge my­self,” he says.</p>
    <p>“There’s a great quote by Bruce Lee I’ve lived with my en­tire life. It goes along the lines of not be­ing lazy in any as­pect of your life be­cause that’ll bleed into ev­ery­thing else. You’ve got to keep push­ing and break­ing your plateaus.”</p>
    <p>His sense of style re­flects the ever-evolv­ing as­pects of his ca­reer and life he aims to keep up with.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways chang­ing. I put my own spin on trends. I’ve been al­low­ing my­self to ex­press my feel­ings and per­son­al­ity with my cloth­ing.”</p>
    <p>Among his wardrobe es­sen­tials are a vin­tage Prada checked jacket, an over­sized sweater and track pants from his favourite brand, Adi­das, and a whole lot of hats.</p>
    <p>Set to ap­pear in Swim­ming With Sharks, Shazam! 2 and To All The Boys 3 – and with many other projects in the pipe­line – But­ler is mak­ing his mark in Hol­ly­wood.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice for other Asian ac­tors look­ing to break the mould?</p>
    <p>“Don’t be afraid of ex­press­ing your­self and fight­ing for your cre­ativ­ity. Don’t be afraid to not fol­low the rules.”</p>
    <p>I’d love to play a Chris Pratt or Ryan Reynolds that isn’t Asian – ob­vi­ously, the race can be Asian, but it doesn’t need to be a mar­tial artist or a Ja­panese swords­man. At the end of the day, I want to have roles in which I can have fun and dig into. ’’</p>
