    <p>“Sapna” – the Hindi word for dream – is what she tells The Sun­day Times to use in place of her ac­tual name in this ar­ti­cle. It is how this sur­vivor of a gang rape in the state of Haryana wants to be iden­ti­fied – not as a dif­fi­dent vic­tim but as a doughty sur­vivor.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old’s dream is to be­come a lawyer so she can help other women sur­vivors of sex­ual as­sault fight back.</p>
    <p>“It is a prom­ise I made to my­self and oth­ers,” she said, seated on a cot. Be­low stand the dusty black shoes she wears to court as an ap­pren­tice, its or­na­men­tal steel bow gleam­ing in the room’s flu­o­res­cent light.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently a fourth-year law un­der­grad­u­ate, Sapna’s re­solve stems from events that took place on Sept 9, 2012. Then 15, she was on her way to her grandmothe­r’s house in Hisar when she was ab­ducted in broad day­light and gang raped by around a dozen up­per caste Jat men from Dabra, a vil­lage Sapna also lived in. They even recorded the as­sault on a phone.</p>
    <p>They then aban­doned the girl, a Dalit – one of In­dia’s most op­pressed groups who lie at the bot­tom of Hin­duism’s caste hi­er­ar­chy – in the field in Dabra where she was raped. “They fled, think­ing I was dead,” she said. “I got up, cleaned my­self and put on my clothes that were ly­ing nearby.”</p>
    <p>She walked more than 2km to the road and got a lift to re­turn home. That evening, Sapna – who was raised just like her brother and never ex­pected to do house­hold chores – washed clothes for the first time.</p>
    <p>“They still had stains on them so I put them on a hanger and hung them in my cup­board,” she said.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til an­other nine days that she gath­ered the courage to tell her par­ents what she had been through. Her at­tack­ers, since the in­ci­dent, had even ha­rassed her with veiled threats as she trav­elled to school.</p>
    <p>Sapna’s fa­ther de­cided to take her the same day to file a po­lice com­plaint but was ac­costed by some Jat men, in­clud­ing some of the per­pe­tra­tors, on the way. They or­dered him not to file a com­plaint.</p>
    <p>He re­turned home and promised to head back the day af­ter.</p>
    <p>That did not hap­pen. Over­whelmed by guilt that he had failed to file a com­plaint, he killed him­self by con­sum­ing pes­ti­cide that night.</p>
    <p>“He felt that killing him­self would help se­cure jus­tice,” said Sapna.</p>
    <p>A first in­for­ma­tion re­port was filed by the teenager the fol­low­ing day, but she claimed the po­lice laid the blame for the rape on mem­bers of the Dalit com­mu­nity and even framed her as an “ac­cused” in her fa­ther’s sui­cide.</p>
    <p>Sapna filed a fresh com­plaint the same day, fol­low­ing protests by lo­cal Dal­its and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­most as if I had turned 18 and at­tained ma­tu­rity in those nine days. Men­tally, I be­came re­ally strong. I would cry so much, but had no­body to share my pain with,” she said, adding that her cam­paign for jus­tice would not have been pos­si­ble with­out the sup­port she re­ceived from lo­cal Dal­its, as well as non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) and lawyers.</p>
    <p>“You need a cer­tain amount of courage to even get to the po­lice sta­tion and face the kind of ques­tions they ask,” she said, de­tail­ing the lack of sen­si­tiv­ity and pri­vacy she en­dured there.</p>
    <p>“Crowds gather, peo­ple peer in from win­dows. Is this the girl who has been raped, they ask.”</p>
    <p>Pres­sure mounted fur­ther from lo­cal in­flu­en­tial Jat caste groups. In re­turn for a with­drawal of her com­plaint, they pro­posed to have her mar­ried to one of her rapists or of­fered fi­nan­cial com­pen­sa­tion, said Sapna.</p>
    <p>Of the 12 ac­cused, eight were ar­rested in 10 days fol­low­ing her com­plaint as protests con­tin­ued. A fast­track court in Hisar found four of them guilty and sen­tenced them to life im­pris­on­ment in May 2013. It ac­quit­ted the other four.</p>
    <p>Not sat­is­fied with the verdict, Sapna filed an ap­peal at the High Court in Chandigarh, where the case is still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Nearly 10 Dalit women were raped ev­ery day in In­dia last year, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial fig­ures. Most re­turn to a meek and sup­pressed ex­is­tence; it is the few such as Sapna who gather enough courage to fight back against sys­temic in­jus­tices.</p>
    <p>She even started Bobo Gang (lit­er­ally Gang of Sis­ters) in 2018, an in­for­mal col­lec­tive to em­power women by train­ing them in self-de­fence tech­niques and of­fer­ing men­tal health work­shops. A key in­ter­ven­tion is also to en­sure ru­ral women have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the law and are able to ac­cess le­gal sup­port when needed.</p>
    <p>“For­get le­gal aware­ness – there are Dalit women here who still don’t know who Babasa­heb Ambed­kar was,” she said, re­fer­ring to the Dalit leader who chaired the com­mit­tee that drafted In­dia’s Con­sti­tu­tion and con­tin­ues to in­spire Dal­its in their cam­paign for equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The re­cent case of a Dalit girl be­ing as­saulted in Ut­tar Pradesh, even though height­en­ing Sapna’s fears, has re­in­forced her re­solve to be­come a lawyer.</p>
    <p>Once she has earned her law de­gree, Sapna in­tends to stride into Dabra with pride, dressed in her full le­gal liv­ery. “I am the first girl from my vil­lage to study at a univer­sity,” she said. “I want those who once pitied me to feel proud of what I have achieved.”</p>
    <p>PICK­ING HER­SELF UP</p>
    <p>They fled, think­ing I was dead. I got up, cleaned my­self ’’ and put on my clothes that were ly­ing nearby.</p>

    <p>AN ACT OF COURAGE</p>
    <p>You need a cer­tain amount of courage to even get to the po­lice sta­tion and face the kind of ques­tions they ask. Crowds gather, peo­ple peer in from win­dows. Is this ’’ the girl who has been raped, they ask.</p>

    <p>PROUD ACHIEVE­MENT</p>
    <p>I am the first girl from my vil­lage to study at a univer­sity. I want those who once pitied me to feel proud ’’ of what I have achieved.</p>
