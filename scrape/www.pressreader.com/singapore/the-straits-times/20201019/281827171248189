    <p>WELLINGTON • New Zealand’s rul­ing Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern yes­ter­day said that she would form a gov­ern­ment within two to three weeks, but did not com­ment on a pos­si­ble coali­tion deal with the Green Party.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern, who was handed a re­sound­ing vic­tory in last Satur­day’s gen­eral elec­tion, said she had in­formed gover­nor-gen­eral Patsy Reddy that her party had the abil­ity to form the next gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre-left leader also said there was no need to bring in any new Covid-19 re­stric­tions af­ter one fresh case of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion was re­ported in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion said Ms Ardern’s land­slide win means she no longer has any ex­cuses for fail­ing to de­liver on her visionary prom­ises.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern won a his­toric out­right ma­jor­ity in the polls – the first since New Zealand adopted pro­por­tional vot­ing in 1996 – mean­ing she can im­ple­ment poli­cies with­out sup­port from mi­nor par­ties.</p>
    <p>The charis­matic leader was crit­i­cised dur­ing her first term for not ac­com­plish­ing key prom­ises such as pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and re­duc­ing child poverty.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader Ju­dith Collins said Ms Ardern’s elec­tion suc­cess meant she could no longer blame coali­tion part­ners for frus­trat­ing her pro­gres­sive agenda be­cause she now had a free hand to do as she pleased. “The gov­ern­ment has got the man­date to do all the things that they’ve promised to do, so they can’t blame any­one else for not de­liv­er­ing,” she told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign­ing dur­ing the elec­tion cen­tred on the gov­ern­ment’s suc­cess­ful coro­n­avirus re­sponse, with Ms Ardern dub­bing it the “Covid elec­tion”, and cri­sis man­age­ment has marked the leader’s first term.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the pan­demic, she had re­sponded with com­pas­sion and de­ci­sive pol­icy ac­tion af­ter the March 2019 Christchur­ch mosques at­tack, when a white su­prem­a­cist gun­man killed 51 Mus­lim wor­ship­pers. She also com­forted a shocked na­tion last De­cem­ber when a vol­canic erup­tion at White Is­land, also known as Whakaari, killed 21 peo­ple and left dozens more with hor­rific burns.</p>
    <p>New Zealand has recorded only 25 coro­n­avirus deaths in a pop­u­la­tion of five mil­lion, which Ms Collins said boosted Ms Ardern’s stand­ing in an elec­torate anx­ious about the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Collins, known as “Crusher” for her hard­line poli­cies as po­lice min­is­ter in a pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ment, has ques­tioned Ms Ardern’s bigspend­ing re­sponse to New Zealand’s virus-in­duced re­ces­sion. “I hope that our coun­try does a lot bet­ter than I think the cur­rent gov­ern­ment’s fis­cal poli­cies and set­tings will en­able it to do,” she said. “I feel very con­cerned for my coun­try.”</p>
    <p>In her vic­tory speech late on Satur­day night, Ms Ardern flagged in­creased state hous­ing, more re­new­able en­ergy and other in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment. She also spoke of more train­ing pro­grammes, job cre­ation, pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and a de­ter­mi­na­tion to tackle is­sues such as cli­mate change, poverty and in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>“We have the man­date to ac­cel­er­ate our re­sponse and our re­cov­ery – and to­mor­row we start!” Ms Ardern said. Asked if she had en­joyed a liein af­ter an ex­haust­ing cam­paign, she replied: “No, I was deal­ing with Covid.”</p>
    <p>Labour’s 49.1 per cent of the vote was its best elec­tion per­for­mance since 1946, while Na­tional’s 26.8 per cent was the sec­ond-worst since the party was founded in 1936. Ms Collins said she would re­main as Na­tional leader but would also com­mis­sion an in­de­pen­dent re­view into how the party’s vote slumped al­most 18 points from the last elec­tion in 2017.</p>
    <p>The party’s sup­port typ­i­cally sits around the mid-40s and Ms Collins ad­mit­ted that there was prob­a­bly com­pla­cency among some of her col­leagues who viewed Ms Ardern’s shock win three years ago as a one­off.</p>
