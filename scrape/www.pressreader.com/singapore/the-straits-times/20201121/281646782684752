    <p>Mr Lee Hsien Yang’s role in his fa­ther’s last will was set out by a Court of Three Judges, which noted more than once in its judg­ment that his wife Lee Suet Fern had sim­ply acted on his wishes and fo­cused on what he wanted done.</p>
    <p>The court had ex­am­ined Mr Lee Hsien Yang’s role, in try­ing to dis­cern Mrs Lee’s cul­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>It found that the younger Mr Lee had got his wife in­volved in the prepa­ra­tion and ex­e­cu­tion of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s last will, and de­scribed some as­pects of an e-mail that he sent on Dec 16, 2013 as “trou­bling”.</p>
    <p>Over 16 hours from Dec 16 to 17, Mrs Lee had for­warded a draft will to the se­nior Mr Lee at the in­struc­tion of her hus­band, made ar­range­ments for her col­leagues to wit­ness its sign­ing, and en­sured this was ex­pe­di­tiously done. All the while, she kept tabs on the process, even send­ing out in­struc­tions while on a plane to Paris.</p>
    <p>The court, which found Mrs Lee guilty of mis­con­duct for her in­volve­ment in the will, said her con­duct had to be seen in the light of her “di­vided loy­al­ties”.</p>
    <p>“On the one hand, (she) was loyal to her hus­band, who was a sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fi­ciary un­der the last will and who was ev­i­dently keen to rush its ex­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>“On the other hand, (she) had a re­spon­si­bil­ity to act hon­ourably and to en­sure that (Mr Lee Kuan Yew), who she would rea­son­ably have re­garded as her client, was fully ap­prised of the fac­tual po­si­tion be­fore he pro­ceeded to ex­e­cute the last will.”</p>
    <p>A ques­tion the court con­sid­ered was whether Mr Lee Hsien Yang or Mrs Lee had re­ceived in­struc­tions from Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple had ini­tially said to a min­is­te­rial com­mit­tee – set up in 2016 to look into Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s wishes for his fam­ily home at 38 Ox­ley Road – that the se­nior Mr Lee had given ex­press in­struc­tions to Mrs Lee to pre­pare his will.</p>
    <p>But to a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal ex­am­in­ing Mrs Lee’s con­duct, they changed their ac­count and said Mr Lee Kuan Yew had given his in­struc­tions to Mr Lee Hsien Yang in­stead. It was Mr Lee Hsien Yang who had roped Mrs Lee in on Dec 16, 2013 to help with the will, as he was trav­el­ling to Bris­bane that very day, the cou­ple added.</p>
    <p>In its judg­ment re­leased yes­ter­day, the court said that af­ter re­view­ing ev­i­dence in­clud­ing e-mails be­tween the par­ties, it agreed that Mr Lee Kuan Yew had in­deed con­veyed his wishes to his son.</p>
    <p>“All of this leads us to con­clude that the min­is­te­rial com­mit­tee state­ments were un­true and gave the in­cor­rect im­pres­sion that Mr Lee Hsien Yang had not him­self been in­volved in re­ceiv­ing (Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s) in­struc­tions to re­vert to the first will.”</p>
    <p>The en­tirely con­tra­dic­tory ac­counts given to the min­is­te­rial com­mit­tee and dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal showed dis­hon­esty on the part of the cou­ple, the court added.</p>
    <p>It sug­gested that Mr Lee Hsien Yang may have wanted to avoid the im­pres­sion that he had any part to play in his fa­ther’s wishes to re­vert to his first will and in­sert a de­mo­li­tion clause stat­ing his wishes for the Ox­ley Road house to be torn down.</p>
    <p>An­other is­sue was whether Mr Lee Hsien Yang had for­warded the draft last will to his wife to send over to his fa­ther. He had in­sisted that he did so, but the court said that it be­lieved Mr Lee Hsien Yang was “not telling the truth”. Mrs Lee’s ev­i­dence was “sim­i­larly un­true and to be re­jected”, it added.</p>
    <p>It noted that nei­ther Mr Lee Hsien Yang nor Mrs Lee could pro­vide any ev­i­dence that he had done so, as they in­sisted that the e-mails had been deleted.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, there was ev­i­dence that Mrs Lee had been in­volved in the draft­ing of the se­nior Mr Lee’s first will, and had old copies of it in her in­box.</p>
    <p>The court also found that Mrs Lee was in no po­si­tion to make any rep­re­sen­ta­tion to the ef­fect that the draft last will was the same as the ac­tual ver­sion of the first will, given that the “ex­e­cuted ver­sion of the first will was never in her hands”.</p>
    <p>which found Mrs Lee Suet Fern guilty of mis­con­duct for her in­volve­ment in the will, and said her con­duct had to be seen in the light of her “di­vided loy­al­ties” to her hus­band Lee Hsien Yang (left) and to Mr Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>“De­spite this, she did make such a rep­re­sen­ta­tion, which was in fact false,” the court said.</p>
    <p>It also de­scribed as “dis­turb­ing and crit­i­cally im­por­tant” a se­ries of events re­lated to Mr Lee Hsien Yang’s ac­tions on Dec 16, 2013.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his wife had sent the se­nior Mr Lee the draft will on Dec 16 at 7.08pm, copy­ing Ms Kwa Kim Li, Mr Lee Hsien Yang had sent his fa­ther an e-mail at 7.31pm copied to Mrs Lee and the se­nior Mr Lee’s sec­re­tary, but with Ms Kwa re­moved from the list of ad­dressees.</p>
    <p>In that e-mail, he said he could not con­tact Ms Kwa, and that he did not think it was wise for his fa­ther to wait un­til she was back be­fore sign­ing his last will.</p>
    <p>He also said Mrs Lee could ar­range for wit­nesses for the ex­e­cu­tion of the last will. Cit­ing this email, the court said sev­eral as­pects of it were “trou­bling”.</p>
    <p>The court noted that it did not ap­pear that Mr Lee Hsien Yang had checked with any­one when Ms Kwa would be con­tactable, adding that he had re­moved her from the list of e-mail ad­dressees with­out know­ing whether his fa­ther would agree to it be­ing done.</p>
    <p>Ms Kwa was the lawyer who had pre­pared all the six pre­vi­ous ver­sions of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s will, and he had dis­cussed his last will with her just days be­fore.</p>
    <p>“It is clear from this short ex­change that (Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s) shift in po­si­tion was ini­ti­ated by Mr Lee Hsien Yang, and not by Mrs Lee or Mr Lee Kuan Yew him­self,” the court said.</p>
    <p>It added that “the sit­u­a­tion changed ma­te­ri­ally” af­ter this 7.31pm e-mail as Mrs Lee be­came the only lawyer re­main­ing on the cor­re­spon­dence, and the onus then fell on her to en­sure that the ver­sion of the will signed by the se­nior Mr Lee truly re­flected his wishes and was ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she had not done so, and had been happy to push through the ex­e­cu­tion of the will in an “un­seemly rush”. Through­out the process, Mrs Lee had also been re­ly­ing en­tirely on what her hus­band said were the wishes of the se­nior Mr Lee, the court said.</p>
    <p>‘DI­VIDED LOY­AL­TIES’</p>
    <p>On the one hand,</p>
    <p>(she) was loyal to her hus­band, who was a sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fi­ciary un­der the last will and who was ev­i­dently keen to rush its ex­e­cu­tion. On the other hand, (she) had a re­spon­si­bil­ity to act hon­ourably and to en­sure that</p>
    <p>(Mr Lee Kuan Yew), who she would rea­son­ably have re­garded as her client, was fully ap­prised of the fac­tual po­si­tion be­fore he pro­ceeded to ex­e­cute the last will.</p>
