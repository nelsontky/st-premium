    <p>Twenty drone oper­a­tors have been ar­rested in the last three months for il­le­gally fly­ing their drones within 5km of Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>This is out of 44 such cases re­ported this year, the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) said yes­ter­day. It saw eight cases re­ported be­fore July last year.</p>
    <p>Dis­clos­ing the fig­ures, CAAS said mea­sures to counter un­manned air­craft sys­tems are be­ing beefed up, af­ter unau­tho­rised drones twice dis­rupted air­port op­er­a­tions in June last year.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures in­clude putting in place spe­cialised radar to bet­ter de­tect il­le­gal drones.</p>
    <p>In July last year, CAAS and Changi Air­port Group set up an op­er­a­tions com­mand-and-con­trol cen­tre to co­or­di­nate and in­te­grate all counter op­er­a­tions against drones flown near the Changi aero­drome.</p>
    <p>Il­le­gal drones caused sig­nif­i­cant dis­rup­tions to Changi in June last year. The first in­ci­dent be­tween June 18 and 19 caused de­lays to 37 flights and af­fected op­er­a­tions at one of Changi’s two run­ways for short pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>On June 24, a com­bi­na­tion of unau­tho­rised drones and bad weather de­layed about 15 de­par­ture and three ar­rival flights, and caused an­other seven flights to be di­verted.</p>
    <p>There have been no in­tru­sions lead­ing to flight dis­rup­tions at the air­port since July last year, Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean said yes­ter­day, not­ing that the au­thor­i­ties had brought for­ward plans to en­hance anti-drone ca­pa­bil­i­ties at Changi.</p>
    <p>“We have de­vel­oped quite a rea­son­able ca­pa­bil­ity, but this is a very chal­leng­ing area and con­tin­ues to evolve very rapidly be­cause drone tech­nol­ogy is mov­ing very fast,” he told re­porters, adding that ex­ist­ing mea­sures will con­tinue to be im­proved.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, CAAS said the 20 er­rant oper­a­tors were ar­rested for fly­ing drones with­out per­mits within 5km of Changi Air­port, in­clud­ing at ar­eas such as Pu­lau Ubin, Changi Coastal Road, Pasir Ris Park, Be­dok Reser­voir and Tanah Merah.</p>
    <p>Ground pa­trol forces have been stepped up to look out for such oper­a­tors is­land­wide, fo­cus­ing on hot spots iden­ti­fied, it added.</p>
    <p>“CAAS takes a se­ri­ous view of er­rant un­manned air­craft op­er­a­tions and will not hes­i­tate to take en­force­ment ac­tion against those who con­tra­vene the law.”</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of un­manned air­craft of­fences in­volved op­er­at­ing them with­out the re­quired per­mits, said CAAS, the lead agency over­see­ing the safe and re­spon­si­ble use of un­manned air­craft in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A mi­nor­ity of the of­fences in­volved non-com­pli­ance to reg­is­tra­tion re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>CAAS said it adopts a “multi-lay­ered ap­proach” to en­sure safe and re­spon­si­ble use of drones, rang­ing from ed­u­ca­tion, reg­u­la­tion and reg­is­tra­tion, to mon­i­tor­ing of crit­i­cal ar­eas as well as en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>It works with other agen­cies in this ef­fort, in­clud­ing the po­lice, air force, na­tional wa­ter agency PUB, De­fence Science and Tech­nol­ogy Agency, and the Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Na­tional Se­cu­rity, yes­ter­day vis­ited one spe­cialised radar near the air­port’s run­way which was set up af­ter June last year.</p>
    <p>The radar is among the sen­sors in­stalled to pro­vide early warn­ing of il­le­gal drone op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Re­porters also ob­served of­fi­cers car­ry­ing a ra­dio fre­quency jam­mer and the ground en­force­ment of­fi­cers who were de­ployed.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo noted that drone in­tru­sions are an evolv­ing prob­lem and a dif­fi­cult one to re­solve, with many air­ports in the world, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, try­ing and test­ing meth­ods of coun­ter­ing them.</p>
    <p>But the hope is that there is no need to catch any­one, he said. “We hope that drone oper­a­tors will un­der­take upon them­selves to op­er­ate drones in a safe way.”</p>
    <p>CHAL­LENG­ING PROB­LEM We have de­vel­oped quite a rea­son­able ca­pa­bil­ity, but this is a very chal­leng­ing area and con­tin­ues to evolve very rapidly be­cause drone tech­nol­ogy ’’ is mov­ing very fast. SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER TEO CHEE HEAN, who said the au­thor­i­ties had brought for­ward plans to en­hance anti-drone ca­pa­bil­i­ties at Changi, and that ex­ist­ing mea­sures will con­tinue to be im­proved.</p>
