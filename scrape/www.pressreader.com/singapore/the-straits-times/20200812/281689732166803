    <p>A to­tal of 61 new Covid-19 pa­tients were an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day, the low­est daily to­tal in more than four months since April 2, when 49 new in­fec­tions were re­ported.</p>
    <p>Two young chil­dren were among the cases. The first, a one-year-old Sin­ga­porean girl, ex­pe­ri­enced on­set of symp­toms last Satur­day. She was one of two pa­tients in the com­mu­nity an­nounced yes­ter­day. Both are fam­ily mem­bers and were linked to pre­vi­ous cases. They were tested while un­der quar­an­tine, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The other was a three-year-old girl, a long-term visit pass holder. The In­dian national was asymp­to­matic when tested and was one of three im­ported pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All three ar­rived from In­dia and had been placed on 14-day stayhome no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore. They had been tested while serv­ing their no­tices, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bukit Timah Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre, 111 Som­er­set and a FairPrice out­let at Bukit Pan­jang Plaza were added to the list of places vis­ited by coro­n­avirus pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, to in­form those who were there at those times to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site. It said close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 56 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,353.</p>
    <p>MOH added that 37 clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries have been closed, and the dor­mi­to­ries now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion. About 22,500 work­ers were still serv­ing out their quar­an­tine pe­riod as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These work­ers will be tested when their iso­la­tion ends, and MOH ex­pects the num­ber of cases an­nounced daily to re­main high, be­fore ta­per­ing down.</p>
