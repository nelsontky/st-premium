    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) has urged Mus­lims to be vac­ci­nated once a Covid-19 vac­cine is avail­able, and med­i­cally au­tho­rised as safe and ef­fec­tive. In re­li­gious guid­ance is­sued yes­ter­day, Muis said a Covid-19 vac­cine is per­mis­si­ble for use as it is a ba­sic ne­ces­sity to pro­tect lives in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Seven new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,320.</p>
    <p>All were im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There were no cases in the com­mu­nity or within work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MOH said the seven i mported cases com­prised one per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR), one work pass holder, four work per­mit hold­ers and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>The PR, a 13-year-old girl, re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Of the five em­ployed here, one is a 33-year-old work pass holder. She is an In­dian na­tional who ar­rived from In­dia.</p>
    <p>The other four work­ing here are work per­mit hold­ers. One of them, a 38-year-old Filip­ina, ar­rived from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Two work per­mit hold­ers are In­dian na­tion­als from In­dia – a 34-year-old woman and a 27-year-old woman.</p>
    <p>The last work per­mit holder is a 26-year-old In­done­sian woman who ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing im­ported pa­tient is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder – a 36-year-old In­done­sian woman who ar­rived from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>All seven were asymp­to­matic when they were tested for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are i n progress, adding that all iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the pa­tients have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>MOH also said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 11 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,193 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 21 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 62 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
