    <p>ARSE­NAL FOR­WARD SCORES TWICE TO SINK MAN CITY IN FA CUP</p>
    <p>LONDON • With one year left on his con­tract, the fu­ture of Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang will be one of the big­gest talk­ing points when the English foot­ball trans­fer win­dow opens next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>At 31, the Gabon striker has one last big deal he can sign and he is said to be weigh­ing up his op­tions amid re­ported in­ter­est from In­ter Mi­lan, Barcelona and Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>For all his abil­i­ties, Aubameyang has had lit­tle silverware to show for it, win­ning a French League Cup and a Ger­man Cup with St Eti­enne and Borus­sia Dort­mund re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>But after Arse­nal’s 2-0 FA Cup semi-fi­nal vic­tory over Manch­ester City at Wem­b­ley on Satur­day, man­ager Mikel Arteta is hope­ful the up­set will con­vince the player to com­mit his fu­ture to the London club.</p>
    <p>Aubameyang scored ei­ther side of the break to make it 25 goals in all</p>
    <p>com­pe­ti­tions this term as the Gun­ners booked a record 21st ap­pear­ance in the FA Cup fi­nal, sched­uled for Aug 1.</p>
    <p>“Good and beau­ti­ful mo­ments, they are al­ways bet­ter than the bad ones,” Arteta, who was ap­pointed in De­cem­ber and is aim­ing for his maiden tro­phy, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“As I told you, the way I look at him when I speak with him, he sounds pretty con­vinced.</p>
    <p>“But ob­vi­ously, if he can see that suc­cess and the di­rec­tion we are tak­ing is the right one, he will be more pos­i­tive about it, yes.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, it will help him to be more con­vinced we are go­ing in the right di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The win against City came just three days after the Gun­ners beat English cham­pi­ons Liver­pool 2-1, in­flict­ing on the Reds just their third top-flight loss this term.</p>
    <p>Most pun­dits did not give Arse­nal a chance, point­ing to a run of seven straight de­feats in all com­pe­ti­tions by City, with an ag­gre­gate of 20-2 prior to the Wem­b­ley show­down.</p>
    <p>But de­spite giv­ing up the ma­jor­ity of pos­ses­sion, with City en­joy­ing 72 per cent of the ball, the record 13-time Cup win­ners were able to stand up to the pres­sure and ef­fec­tively hit Pep Guardi­ola’s men on the counter for both goals.</p>
    <p>The opener was par­tic­u­larly eye­catch­ing, with 18 passes made and 10 of their 11 play­ers in­volved in the build-up, and Arteta feels his side are slowly, but surely im­prov­ing.</p>
    <p>“We are re­ally happy with what has hap­pened in the last four or five days,” the Spa­niard said. “To beat prob­a­bly the best two teams in Europe is the nicest thing to do, so credit to the play­ers for what they are do­ing, their per­for­mances and the level of fight they are show­ing.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal have had, by their usual stan­dards, a poor sea­son and real­is­ti­cally need to lift the Cup if they are to avoid miss­ing out on Euro­pean foot­ball for the first time since the 1995-96 sea­son.</p>
    <p>This will be their third Cup fi­nal in as many years, and hav­ing failed pre­vi­ously – they lost in the 2018 League Cup fi­nal and last year’s Europa League fi­nal – David Luiz feels his team­mates can fi­nally get over the line this time round.</p>
    <p>The Brazil­ian de­fender, who re­deemed him­self after a string of high-pro­file er­rors this term, said: “We have a fi­nal to play this sea­son, and we will try and win a ti­tle for this club be­cause this club de­serves to win a tro­phy.”</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola, though, was un­happy as his side could not make their su­pe­ri­or­ity count de­spite hav­ing 13 at­tempts on goal.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on their fail­ure to re­tain the Cup and record suc­ces­sive tre­bles, the City boss said: “We started slow and with­out the way you have to play.</p>
    <p>“We are al­ways ready many times but to­day, we were not. They de­fended well. It hap­pened (when Arse­nal played) against Liver­pool too, so we knew it. But we were not good.”</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ously, if he can see that suc­cess and the di­rec­tion we are tak­ing is the right one, he will be more pos­i­tive about it, yes. Hope­fully, it will help him to be more con­vinced we are go­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
