    <p>Sin­ga­porean blog­ger Amos Yee, 20, was charged with so­lic­i­ta­tion and pos­ses­sion of child pornog­ra­phy in an Illi­nois court on Fri­day, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Yee, who was jailed twice in Sin­ga­pore, in 2015 and 2016, for wound­ing re­li­gious feel­ings, was granted asy­lum in the United States in 2017 and has been liv­ing in Chicago since then.</p>
    <p>He al­legedly ex­changed nude pho­tos and thou­sands of mes­sages with a 14-year-old Texas girl while in Chicago, re­ported the Chicago Sun­Times daily news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Yee ap­peared at the Leighton Crim­i­nal Court­house in Chicago on Fri­day for his bond hear­ing.</p>
    <p>His bail was set at US$1 mil­lion (S$1.36 mil­lion) and he has been banned from us­ing the In­ter­net while await­ing trial.</p>
    <p>If con­victed, Yee’s asy­lum sta­tus could be re­voked and he could be de­ported.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the re­port, pros­e­cu­tors ob­tained mes­sages Yee ex­changed be­tween April and July last year which in­cluded nude pho­to­graphs he asked for and re­ceived from the girl, as well as nude pho­tos of him­self that he sent to her.</p>
    <p>They said that the girl re­peat­edly brought up her age, and Yee had told her to re­move her age from her What­sApp pro­file.</p>
    <p>Af­ter their re­la­tion­ship soured, the girl reached out to a group called “in­ter­ested in ex­pos­ing pae­dophiles” and Home­land Se­cu­rity of­fi­cials were no­ti­fied, said the re­port, cit­ing pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Fri­day, New York-based Sin­ga­porean ac­tivist Melissa Chen, a for­mer ad­vo­cate of Yee, ap­peared to con­firm their ac­count.</p>
    <p>She wrote that she had been first alerted to Yee’s al­leged ac­tiv­ity anony­mously more than a year ago, by an in­di­vid­ual from the com­mu­nity of “MAP (mi­nor-at­tracted peo­ple) hunters”.</p>
    <p>“I took the al­le­ga­tions se­ri­ously, re­sponded and ver­i­fied the ac­cu­sa­tions. Af­ter speak­ing with the young vic­tim, I was bro­ken. I vowed to do all I could to get her jus­tice and re­move him from so­ci­ety,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Ms Chen had as­sisted Yee in his po­lit­i­cal asy­lum ap­pli­ca­tion, but later called for him to be de­ported from the US over his cham­pi­oning of pae­dophilia.</p>
    <p>While liv­ing in the US, Yee posted videos on YouTube pro­mot­ing pae­dophilia. His YouTube chan­nel and ac­counts on other so­cial me­dia sites, in­clud­ing Face­book and Twit­ter, have since been shut down.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted on Fri­day, Ms San­dra Gross­man, who was Yee’s pro bono at­tor­ney for his asy­lum ap­pli­ca­tion, said she could not com­ment on her for­mer client due to at­tor­ney-client priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>Yee is next due in court on Nov 5. As a 16-year-old in Sin­ga­pore, Yee was con­victed in May 2015 of ha­rass­ment and in­sult­ing a re­li­gious group over com­ments he made about Chris­tians and Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew soon af­ter Mr Lee’s death.</p>
    <p>Ahead of his sen­tenc­ing, 77 in­di­vid­u­als signed an open let­ter in July 2015 where they urged the state to “dis­charge its pros­e­cu­to­rial func­tion with cau­tion, sen­si­tiv­ity and gen­eros­ity”.</p>
    <p>The let­ter, which was sent to Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, was signed by civil so­ci­ety ac­tivist Braema Mathi, play­wright Al­fian Sa’at and aca­demic Che­rian Ge­orge, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Yee was even­tu­ally sen­tenced to four weeks’ jail.</p>
    <p>In 2016, he was sen­tenced to six weeks’ jail and fined $2,000 af­ter post­ing com­ments in on­line videos and blog posts that were deroga­tory of Chris­tian­ity and Is­lam.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber that year, Yee left for the US a day be­fore he was to re­port for a med­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion ahead of en­list­ment into na­tional ser­vice. He ap­plied for po­lit­i­cal asy­lum and was granted the sta­tus in Septem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>In 2018, he posted pro-pae­dophilia mes­sages on­line and had his YouTube, Word­Press, Face­book and Twit­ter ac­counts banned.</p>
