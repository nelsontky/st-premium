    <p>When avid cy­clist Ja­son Tay felt weaker dur­ing one of his reg­u­lar cy­cling trips in Jan­uary, he stopped af­ter 30 min­utes but brushed it off as he had un­der­gone an elec­tro­car­dio­gram (ECG) test just a month ear­lier and the read­ing was nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Two days later at work, the pro­duc­tion man­ager felt some dis­com­fort in his chest and, at the in­sis­tence of his col­league, vis­ited a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner who ad­vised him to go to a hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Tay went to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s ac­ci­dent and emer­gency depart­ment, where he was told he was hav­ing a heart at­tack. He un­der­went an an­gio­plasty and an­other in March.</p>
    <p>“The doc­tor told me I was very for­tu­nate be­cause 50 per cent of vic­tims don’t make it to the hos­pi­tal in time,” the now-re­tired 57-year-old told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“He said the cy­cling prob­a­bly made my heart strong and helped me sur­vive. So in a sense, cy­cling re­ally saved me.”</p>
    <p>For re­cov­ery and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion af­ter his sec­ond op­er­a­tion, Tay started do­ing short walks and short rides on an in­door bi­cy­cle be­fore slowly re­turn­ing to out­door cy­cling.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally suf­fered dur­ing this pe­riod and I felt like I aged 20 years. I would start pant­ing af­ter walk­ing just 20 me­tres,” re­counted Tay, who used to cy­cle for between 30 and 60 min­utes at least once a week. Now on av­er­age, he cy­cles for an hour twice a week.</p>
    <p>“It was hard on me. I was told to do light walk­ing but I also did in­door cy­cling once a week and I found that my strength re­cov­ered much faster.”</p>
    <p>Last month, he com­pleted his long­est ride of about 20km from Be­dok to Ma­rina Bay Sands.</p>
    <p>Next month, he will fur­ther chal­lenge him­self when he at­tempts to com­plete 42km in two ses­sions in the OCBC Cy­cle 2020’s The Sportive Vir­tual Ride.</p>
    <p>While he would like to ride more than 20km in one trip, he is care­ful not to push him­self too hard.</p>
    <p>Tay, a first-time par­tic­i­pant of the an­nual OCBC Cy­cle, said: “Af­ter my heart at­tack, I cy­cle more than I did pre­vi­ously and use my bi­cy­cle as trans­port, so I thought why not try 42km. And I can do it at my own pace.</p>
    <p>“Cy­cling used to just be about ex­plor­ing Sin­ga­pore. But af­ter that, in my 30s and 40s, I was un­der tremen­dous work stress and I re­alised that cy­cling helps me de­stress.</p>
    <p>“So when­ever I feel very stressed, I’ll go cy­cling and come back feel­ing re­freshed.”</p>
    <p>His jour­ney with cy­cling started in his teens when he cy­cled to buy gro­ceries for his mother twice or thrice a week. Then, he started ex­plor­ing nearby kam­pungs and fre­quently cy­cled at East Coast Park.</p>
    <p>“There were no park con­nec­tors last time so we are very for­tu­nate (these days), es­pe­cially dur­ing this pe­riod when you can’t go trav­el­ling. Us­ing park con­nec­tors to ex­plore is a re­ally great thing,” said Tay. “The scenery is very dif­fer­ent now. Last time, there were a lot of nat­u­ral forests and kam­pungs. Now, I get to see dif­fer­ent scenery. If I go to Sen­tosa, I see beaches. If I go to Ma­rina Bay Sands, I see gar­dens.”</p>
    <p>He plans to visit the Sem­bawang Hot Springs on one of his cy­cling trips next and is look­ing for­ward to an­nounc­ing his com­ple­tion of the 42km in the OCBC Cy­cle to his friends on his Face­book page.</p>
    <p>“They’re around my age so I want to tell them it’s pos­si­ble and age is only a num­ber,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I hope they will be in­spired and start their own cy­cling or ex­er­cise rou­tines to main­tain their fitness.</p>
    <p>“And if young peo­ple see that I can fin­ish 42km, they’ll know that they can do it too and prob­a­bly be even bet­ter than me.”</p>
