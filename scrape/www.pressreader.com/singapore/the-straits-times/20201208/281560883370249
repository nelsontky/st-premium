    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi (right) has called for Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton to re­sume talks and reset re­la­tions, ahead of the in­au­gu­ra­tion of United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den. Ad­dress­ing the US-China Business Coun­cil, Mr Wang said the most ur­gent task for both coun­tries was a smooth tran­si­tion of ties.</p>
    <p>One of China’s top diplo­mats has called for Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton to re­sume talks and reset re­la­tions, just weeks be­fore the in­au­gu­ra­tion of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den in the United States.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi, in a video call yes­ter­day with the board mem­bers of the US-China Business Coun­cil, said the “most ur­gent task” for both coun­tries was to en­sure a smooth tran­si­tion of ties, adding that they should work to­gether.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, the two coun­tries should fol­low a di­rec­tion that con­forms to the in­ter­est of both coun­tries’ peo­ple, and strive to restart di­a­logue, re­turn to the right track, and re­build mu­tual trust in the next phase of China-US re­la­tions,” said Mr Wang.</p>
    <p>With the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion on the way out, Bei­jing has been ac­tively sig­nalling that it de­sires a reset in re­la­tions that have nose­dived un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang is the lat­est Chi­nese of­fi­cial to do so.</p>
    <p>State news agency Xinhua, in a read­out of that video call, said Mr Wang laid out Bei­jing’s sug­ges­tions for healthy and sta­ble de­vel­op­ment of ties.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­cluded strength­en­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion and di­a­logue, he said.</p>
    <p>“China and the US should open di­a­logue at all lev­els. Any is­sue can be brought to the ta­ble for dis­cus­sion – whether they are strate­gic, over­all or long-term is­sues, there can be com­mu­ni­ca­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“China’s door to di­a­logue is open at all times.”</p>
    <p>He added that both sides can con­duct “con­sul­ta­tions on spe­cific is­sues” to search for break­throughs or re­sults to boost trust. The For­eign Min­is­ter did not elab­o­rate on the is­sues.</p>
    <p>“For prob­lems that can­not be solved for the time be­ing, we must take a con­struc­tive at­ti­tude to man­age and con­trol them to avoid in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion and es­ca­la­tion af­fect­ing the over­all sit­u­a­tion of Chi­naUS ties,” said Mr Wang.</p>
    <p>The com­ments come just days af­ter the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion slapped fresh travel re­stric­tions on Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party mem­bers over hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton is plan­ning fur­ther sanc­tions on at least a dozen of­fi­cials this week over their role in the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of pro-democ­racy law­mak­ers in Hong Kong, Bloomberg re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump is putting in­creas­ing pres­sure on China in his last days in of­fice, a move ob­servers say is tar­geted at ce­ment­ing his legacy of be­ing tough on the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In his time in the White House, he has launched a trade war against China, sanc­tioned its tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies and pushed to de­cou­ple the economies of the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who is set to take of­fice on Jan 20, has said that un­like his pre­de­ces­sor, he would take a more mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach to con­fronting China.</p>
    <p>While he did not ex­plic­itly name Mr Trump, Mr Wang said the rea­son for the cur­rent state of Sino-US re­la­tions is that “some peo­ple on the Amer­i­can side hold on to an out­dated Cold War men­tal­ity and ide­o­log­i­cal prej­u­dices”.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter added that Bei­jing ex­pects and be­lieves that Wash­ing­ton’s China pol­icy will sooner or later “re­turn to ob­jec­tiv­ity and ra­tio­nal­ity”.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping hinted at the prospect of a reset in ties when he con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den late last month, say­ing that he hoped both sides could pur­sue healthy and sta­ble re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Last week, for­mer Chi­nese vice­for­eign min­is­ter Fu Ying also wrote in a rare com­men­tary in The New York Times that both sides had to hold candid talks to cul­ti­vate the trust needed to tackle global chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>One Chi­nese an­a­lyst said it is “very clear” that Bei­jing wants to seize the op­por­tu­nity pre­sented by a new ad­min­is­tra­tion to kick-start a reset in ties with the US.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing for China now is to con­tin­u­ously strengthen the de­vel­op­ment of its econ­omy and core tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>“If China-US re­la­tions fall into a new Cold War, it will be detri­men­tal to China’s eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal de­vel­op­ment,” said pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions Zhu Feng of Nan­jing Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>For prob­lems that can­not be solved for the time be­ing, we must take a con­struc­tive at­ti­tude to man­age and con­trol them to avoid in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion and es­ca­la­tion af­fect­ing the over­all sit­u­a­tion of China-US ties.</p>
