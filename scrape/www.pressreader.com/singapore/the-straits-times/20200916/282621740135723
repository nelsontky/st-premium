    <p>Sam­sung’s flag­ship 8K smart TV Q950TS comes in 65-, 75- and 85-inch sizes.</p>
    <p>But which­ever the size, it is a doozy of a TV. For one thing, there is its van­ish­ingly thin 2mm bezel that lines the perime­ter of its 8K (7,680 x 4,320 pix­els) quan­tum dot (Qled) dis­play.</p>
    <p>And when mounted on a wall, it blends in to be­come a win­dow of en­ter­tain­ment, with only a 15mmthick bump and sliv­ers of sil­ver grilles on the four sides of the TV break­ing the il­lu­sion while it is dis­play­ing con­tent.</p>
    <p>Its eight speak­ers, sited on its flat back, sup­port an ob­ject-track­ing sound fea­ture that is said to fol­low the move­ment of each scene for a more re­al­is­tic and 3D au­dio ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the TV’s in­puts and power sup­ply unit are neatly lo­cated in a sep­a­rate box called One Con­nect, which is hooked up to the TV via a sin­gle translu­cent ca­ble.</p>
    <p>The One Con­nect box has four HDMI ports and three USB ports, along with an Eth­er­net port and a dig­i­tal op­ti­cal out­put port. How­ever, only one of the four HDMI ports is a HDMI 2.1 port, which can han­dle 8K videos at 60Hz.</p>
    <p>In other words, if you plan to get both of the next-gen­er­a­tion gam­ing con­soles – PlaySta­tion 5 and Xbox Se­ries X – that are ex­pected to launch year-end and which sup­port 8K out­put, you have to swop ca­bles when switch­ing be­tween the two con­soles to get 8K images.</p>
    <p>The Q950TS runs Sam­sung’s Tizen op­er­at­ing sys­tem and comes with stream­ing apps such as Net­flix, HBO Go, Ama­zon Prime, Viu and Ap­pleTV+.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures Sam­sung’s lat­est 8K Quan­tum pro­ces­sor, which pow­ers its 8K ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) up­scal­ing fea­ture. The pro­ces­sor is said to use AI to an­a­lyse and iden­tify pixel char­ac­ter­is­tics to cre­ate 8K-like images.</p>
    <p>An­other eye-catch­ing fea­ture is di­rect full ar­ray lo­cal dim­ming light­ing, which ad­justs bright­ness by zones for richer blacks and op­ti­mised colour con­trast.</p>
    <p>Also tap­ping AI is the Adap­tive Pic­ture fea­ture, which au­to­mat­i­cally ad­justs the dis­play bright­ness ac­cord­ing to am­bi­ent light­ing and pic­ture con­tent.</p>
    <p>To test this fea­ture, I switched off the room lights while watch­ing Peaky Blin­ders on Net­flix and, sure enough, the bright­ness level in the darker ar­eas was au­to­mat­i­cally pumped up.</p>
    <p>Nat­u­rally, im­age qual­ity is the best with na­tive 8K con­tent, which I tested with some 8K footage on a USB drive.</p>
    <p>And what I saw was breath­tak­ing – con­trast­ing, vivid colours with sharp de­tails. I can only imag­ine how the up­com­ing Xbox Se­ries X will play on this TV.</p>
    <p>As for up­scaled 8K video, 4K sources such as Net­flix come close to the 8K stan­dard. But with full high-def­i­ni­tion (HD) or HD sources, the miss­ing pix­els are more ev­i­dent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ir­re­spec­tive of the source res­o­lu­tion, the TV is able to pro­vide de­tails aplenty in the dark ar­eas of images.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, watch­ing Game Of Thrones’ in­fa­mously dark White Walk­ers bat­tle, I can make out more de­tails in the darker ar­eas than on my TV at home.</p>
    <p>The big­gest downer of this drop-dead gor­geous TV is its jaw­drop­ping price tag. Start­ing at $12,999, this TV is not some­thing the av­er­age Sin­ga­porean house­hold can af­ford.</p>
    <p>Not to men­tion, the dearth of na­tive 8K con­tent means con­sumers will not be able to fully utilise its po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>But with the im­mi­nent re­lease of the PlaySta­tion 5 and the Xbox Se­ries X, this might just be the 8K TV to up­grade to in or­der to un­leash the full po­ten­tial of the two nextgen­er­a­tion gam­ing con­soles.</p>
