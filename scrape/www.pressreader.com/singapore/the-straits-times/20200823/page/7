        Top of theNews | | A7 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 23, 2020 Pregnant Indonesian loses baby after virus test delays care Malaysia detects new cluster with 3 cases linked to KL restaurant • The Malaysian authoritie­s have detected a new Covid-19 cluster at a restaurant linked to three confirmed cases in the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah said the first two cases were employees of the restaurant – two foreign workers, aged 26 and 27, who tested positive last Sunday.
“The two cases were detected from random screening conducted on eateries located around Kuala Lumpur’s city centre.”
The ministry then traced the two workers’ close contacts, which led to a 42-year-old Malaysian woman who was a customer of the restaurant.
“She had symptoms of sore throat and headache since Aug 17 and was admitted to the Sungai Buloh Hospital,” Tan Sri Noor Hisham said in a statement on Friday.
The cluster is now identified as the Titiwangsa cluster after the area where the restaurant is located.
Dr Noor Hisham said a total of 672 individual­s had been screened, comprising 16 employees and 656 customers.
“So far, only the three cases are positive infections linked to this cluster, while another 669 individual­s have tested negative.
“Active case detection and close contact tracing are still ongoing,” he said.
Three new cases in Kedah were linked to the Tawar cluster, currently the biggest active Covid-19 cluster in the country. So far, all patients linked to the Tawar cluster are still under treatment.
To date, there have been 63 positive Covid-19 cases from this cluster, with 52 in Kedah and 11 in Penang.
The Tawar cluster had overtaken the Sivagangga cluster, which started in Kedah and has 45 confirmed cases. Only 15 are active cases now.
Meanwhile, Malaysia yesterday recorded eight new Covid-19 cases, bringing the cumulative total to 9,257.
Out of the eight new cases, said Dr Noor Hisham, three were imported while the rest were local transmissi­ons.
The imported cases involve one Malaysian and two foreigners.
In the local transmissi­on cases, Dr Noor Hisham said all five were from the Tawar cluster. tal with the result, it did not acknowledg­e her test certificat­e as it was not attached to her test kit, so she had to take another test.
The doctor who eventually attended to her initially said the unborn baby’s heart rate was weak.
Ms Gusti later underwent a Csection but the baby boy was declared dead.
The doctor said the baby had died in the womb a few days earlier, which the family rejected.
“If he died seven days ago, it would be dangerous for the mother, and there would be some putrefacti­on. But the (body)... looked fresh,” Ms Gusti’s father Ketut Mahajaya said.
Wira Bhakti Mataram Army Hospital head Yudi Akbar Manurung confirmed that Ms Gusti had visited the hospital but said she chose not to take a rapid test there as it was not free.
West Nusa Tenggara Health Agency head Eka Nurhandini said a rapid test was mandatory for pregnant women about to deliver, to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
She said the test would determine how the medical workers handled them. PUTRAJAYA MATARAM CITY TENGGARA) (WEST NUSA • An Indonesian woman’s baby died in her womb after Covid-19 test requiremen­ts delayed the labour care she needed, her family said.
Ms Gusti Ayu Arianti, 23, from Mataram city, capital of West Nusa Tenggara province, went to a local hospital on Tuesday after her water broke.
She asked for the medical team to immediatel­y handle her but was told to first take a Covid-19 rapid test at a different location.
She said the hospital did not provide the virus test and so she had to travel to a community health centre to take one.
“My water had broken, I had lost a lot of blood since I was at home, but I was not immediatel­y treated,” Ms Gusti told Kompas.com.
Arriving at the community health centre, Ms Gusti was not immediatel­y checked, and was even asked to join a line of people taking the test before her husband complained.
She asked for a doctor to check on her baby, but was told to wait for the test result, which took 30 minutes.
