    <p>A young and de­fence­less girl suf­fered re­lent­less sex­ual abuse by her bi­o­log­i­cal fa­ther for nearly five years and ran away from home twice to es­cape his clutches, pros­e­cu­tors told the High Court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 45-year-old man has de­nied com­mit­ting any of the al­leged of­fences, which are said to have taken place be­tween 2010 and 2014 when his daugh­ter was be­tween 10 and 14 years old.</p>
    <p>He is con­test­ing 15 charges – 14 for sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion and one for out­rage of mod­esty – in a trial that started yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He is also chal­leng­ing the ad­mis­si­bil­ity of four po­lice state­ments that were taken from him in Novem­ber 2017 af­ter his ar­rest.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect his daugh­ter, who is now 20 years old.</p>
    <p>Set­ting out its case, the pros­e­cu­tion said it will be call­ing 22 wit­nesses, in­clud­ing the girl’s close friend, her step­fa­ther, her mother and her elder brother.</p>
    <p>The court heard that in 2010, the fam­ily – com­pris­ing the girl, her par­ents, elder brother, younger sis­ter and a do­mes­tic worker – slept to­gether in one room of a flat in Yishun.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion in its open­ing ad­dress said that the man had fon­dled her while every­one was sleep and told her not to tell any­one.</p>
    <p>The man al­legedly told her that he would teach her about sex and then pro­gressed to more in­tru­sive acts, in­clud­ing mak­ing her per­form oral sex on him.</p>
    <p>“As a young and im­pres­sion­able girl, the vic­tim trusted her fa­ther and al­lowed him to con­tinue the sex­ual acts against her,” said the pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2011, soon af­ter the fam­ily moved to a four-room flat in Wood­lands, her par­ents’ relationsh­ip soured.</p>
    <p>The girl ended up shar­ing a bed with her fa­ther, while her mother slept in a sep­a­rate room. The abuse, which in­cluded sodomy, con­tin­ued, said pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>By then, the girl learnt that it was not nor­mal for fa­thers and daugh­ters to be phys­i­cally in­ti­mate and told her fa­ther to stop, the court heard. But he as­sured her that it was okay for them to en­gage in sex­ual activities as long as no­body knew, said the pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>He also im­pressed on her that she would lose a fa­ther if any­one learnt of their sex­ual activities, and she be­came re­signed to the con­stant abuse, said the pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing her par­ents’ di­vorce some­time be­tween 2012 and 2013, the girl re­turned to the Yishun flat with her fa­ther and brother.</p>
    <p>Un­able to tol­er­ate fur­ther al­leged abuse, she ran away to her mother in De­cem­ber 2013. She re­turned to her fa­ther af­ter he vowed to cease all sex­ual activities with her, the court heard.</p>
    <p>But the man re­turned to his old ways, and af­ter en­dur­ing months of abuse, she ran away again at the end of 2014, said the pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>The man agreed to let her re­main with her mother on con­di­tion that she would not tell any­one about the abuse, the court was told.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 2017, the girl told her step­fa­ther and later, her mother, about the al­leged abuse. A po­lice report was lodged that month.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion said the girl’s brother will tes­tify that the ac­cused had con­fessed to com­mit­ting a sex­ual act on her. The brother will also tes­tify that on one oc­ca­sion in 2013 at the Wood­lands flat, he was awo­ken when he heard his sis­ter say­ing “stop”, but re­turned to sleep as he did not sus­pect any­thing was wrong at the time.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent Jereld Xu told the court that while he was record­ing a state­ment from the ac­cused on Nov 23, 2017, the man broke down and said he had wronged his fam­ily and was sorry for what he had done to his daugh­ter. The trial con­tin­ues.</p>
