    <p>1 Herd im­mu­nity for In­dia?</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts are con­sid­er­ing whether herd im­mu­nity is now an op­tion for In­dia as its coron­avirus cases crossed the five mil­lion mark this week. Some be­lieve it is al­ready oc­cur­ring in small ar­eas where high in­fec­tion lev­els have been fol­lowed by a weak­en­ing of the virus, but oth­ers say it is too soon to pre­dict.</p>
    <p>As coron­avirus cases con­tinue to spi­ral in In­dia, only the sec­ond coun­try af­ter the US to cross the five mil­lion mile­stone, ques­tions have been raised over whether herd im­mu­nity is an op­tion for In­dia now.</p>
    <p>Some epi­demi­ol­o­gists be­lieve it is al­ready tak­ing place in small ar­eas where high in­fec­tion lev­els have been fol­lowed by a weak­en­ing of the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers be­lieve that it is too soon to pre­dict or that the con­cept holds lit­tle prom­ise.</p>
    <p>Herd im­mu­nity is usu­ally brought about by a vac­cine or through nat­u­ral im­mu­nity af­ter a size­able num­ber of peo­ple get in­fected and then help block the virus spread.</p>
    <p>While the nat­u­ral herd im­mu­nity con­cept re­mains untested and even con­tro­ver­sial be­cause of the greater risk of mor­tal­ity, re­cent In­dian sero sur­veys – which track an­ti­bod­ies to as­sess ex­po­sure to the virus – have in­di­cated that the virus spread is far more than of­fi­cial statis­tics have re­vealed in In­dia.</p>
    <p>A sero sur­vey by the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search (ICMR) found that In­dia had an es­ti­mated 6.4 mil­lion in­fec­tions in May, when of­fi­cial fig­ures at mid-month put the num­ber of pos­i­tive cases at 85,940.</p>
    <p>In­dian epi­demi­ol­o­gist Jayaprakas­h Muliyil said this makes a strong case for herd im­mu­nity. “In­dia has a huge pop­u­la­tion and virus trans­mis­sion is tak­ing place more or less freely re­gard­less of what you do, ac­cord­ing to our sero sur­veys,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In ar­eas with dense pop­u­la­tions, the virus came un­der con­trol when it reached 55 per cent to 60 per cent (of those in­fected). New case for­ma­tion re­duced con­sid­er­ably. Many of the so-called con­tain­ment ar­eas of the past now pro­duce very lit­tle cases.” He added: “On the other hand, many of the ar­eas which were ear­lier con­sid­ered free of dis­ease are show­ing cases.”</p>
    <p>In­dia has done ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to prevent the virus from spread­ing, in­clud­ing a strin­gent lock­down to break the chain of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>But the grad­ual eas­ing of re­stric­tions with an eye to pre­vent­ing fur­ther dam­age to the econ­omy saw the move­ment of peo­ple, which re­sulted in the virus trav­el­ling to dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The lock­down has not pre­vented virus num­bers from spik­ing even as it has im­proved In­dia’s health ca­pa­bil­i­ties to tackle the virus.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 90,123 new cases were re­ported in the last 24 hours. In­dia now has 5.1 mil­lion in­fec­tions, af­ter the US, which has over 6.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>For now, the gov­ern­ment is not look­ing at herd im­mu­nity as a strat­egy. In­stead it has en­cour­aged keep­ing vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers, mainly the el­derly and those with pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions, safe at home, and has man­dated the use of masks, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and main­tain­ing hy­giene amid a re­sump­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“We are very far away from herd im­mu­nity. It is quite pos­si­ble in the pass­ing days, with more peo­ple in­fected, it may have pos­si­bil­i­ties. We are not in a po­si­tion to say herd im­mu­nity right now,” said Dr Ra­jni Kant from the ICMR.</p>
    <p>“Herd im­mu­nity right now is not a (gov­ern­ment) strat­egy for coron­avirus con­trol. The cur­rent strat­egy is wear­ing a mask, fol­low­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing and good hy­giene with reg­u­lar wash­ing of hands.”</p>
    <p>Still, there is a sil­ver lin­ing in In­dia’s Covid-19 fight.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s mor­tal­ity rate at 1.64 per cent is among the low­est in the world, and re­cov­ery is among the high­est, at 78 per cent to 79 per cent.</p>
    <p>As far as herd im­mu­nity goes, the jury is still out on whether it works at all. Take Swe­den, which has avoided a hard lock­down and in­stead em­pha­sised in­di­vid­ual re­spon­si­bil­ity, in what was seen as a bid to build up herd im­mu­nity among the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>But the coun­try has the fifth-high­est death rate per capita in Eu­rope.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor K. Sri­nath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia, and a mem­ber of the ICMR Na­tional Task Force on Covid-19, de­scribed herd im­mu­nity as a “neb­u­lous con­cept”. “We don’t</p>
    <p>know if the thresh­old (for herd im­mu­nity) is 50, 60 or 70 per cent. We don’t know how long im­mu­nity lasts. But to de­pend on herd immu</p>
    <p>nity as a sure­fire so­lu­tion that is go­ing to lib­er­ate us in the near fu­ture is not a very re­al­is­tic ex­pec­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>He said much now de­pends on how the virus spreads in ru­ral parts and smaller towns. In some ur­ban ar­eas, an in­crease in cases has brought chal­lenges such as a short­age of oxy­gen sup­ply. “Right now, we will have to wait and see what is hap­pen­ing in small towns and vil­lages. If the virus spreads, we will see greater chal­lenges in terms of health in­fra­struc­ture,” he said.</p>
