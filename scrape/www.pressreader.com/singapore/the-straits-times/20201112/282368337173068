    <p>I keep get­ting bet­ter and keep get­ting more com­fort­able the more times I play it.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has si­lenced the Masters’ res­o­nant roars.</p>
    <p>It has erased the par-3 con­test, drained the colour from the win­ter­ing aza­leas and brought brisk north winds into play for the first time.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment, which starts to­day, has been resched­uled from the first Ma­jor of the year to the last and stripped down to play­ing in a “bub­ble” to safe­guard its par­tic­i­pants from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But the usual sus­pects will be in play, from de­fend­ing and 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion Tiger Woods to US Open cham­pion Bryson DeCham­beau, who is plan­ning to “out-drive his­tory” at Au­gusta.</p>
    <p>So too is Dustin John­son. The world No. 1 has only one Ma­jor – the 2016 US Open – but he has fin­ished run­ner-up in three of the past six Ma­jors.</p>
    <p>The reign­ing PGA Tour Player of the Year and FedExCup winner is en­ter­ing the 84th Masters with con­fi­dence thanks to im­proved putting and greater con­sis­tency in his shot­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>“Com­ing off a great year and a good fin­ish last week (he was sec­ond at the Hous­ton Open). Got a lot of con­fi­dence in the game,” John­son said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I’m play­ing re­ally well. It’s prob­a­bly the best I’ve played in my ca­reer but it’s more con­sis­tent, my shot shape, my flight and con­trol­ling my dis­tance.”</p>
    <p>John­son has worked on his short game and putting, two cru­cial as­pects for any winner over the un­du­lat­ing greens of Au­gusta. He be­lieves he is hit­ting peak form – just like in 2017, when he was the ru­n­away favourite, only to with­draw be­fore the start af­ter hurt­ing his back in a freak fall down a stair­case.</p>
    <p>“I’ve put in a lot of work on be­ing able to con­trol my dis­tance with wedges, so it’s very con­sis­tent right now,” he said. “I’m very pleased with where the game is at.</p>
    <p>“I would love to win a lot more Ma­jors. I’d like to get my sec­ond one then add on to that. I’ve still got a lot more years, so I’m not re­ally too stressed about it.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing grown up in Columbia, South Carolina, just an hour’s drive away, the Amer­i­can has long dreamt of win­ning the Masters.</p>
    <p>“I keep get­ting bet­ter and keep get­ting more com­fort­able the more times I play it,” John­son added. “I def­i­nitely get ex­cited. I can feel it com­ing down the stretch be­cause I want to win.</p>
    <p>“As long as the game stays in good form, I’m hope­fully go­ing to be around here on Sun­day and have a chance to win.”</p>
    <p>An­other player in the hunt but also has some­thing to prove to the crit­ics is Rory McIl­roy.</p>
    <p>While the North­ern Ir­ish­man is fairly con­fi­dent of one day win­ning the Masters and com­plet­ing the ca­reer Grand Slam, he has also been around the block of­ten enough to know that noth­ing is guar­an­teed in golf.</p>
    <p>He is all too aware that Aus­tralian Greg Nor­man and South</p>
    <p>DUSTIN JOHN­SON, go­ing into to­day’s first round.</p>
    <p>Africa’s Ernie Els, among oth­ers, never took the fi­nal step to a Green Jacket for all the times they con­tended at Au­gusta.</p>
    <p>Nine years have passed since McIl­roy frit­tered away a four-shot fi­nal-round lead at the tour­na­ment and he has com­peted in five Masters since first be­ing af­forded the chance to com­plete the ca­reer Grand Slam here. He will get an­other chance to be­come the sixth player to com­plete the mod­ern Grand Slam this week­end, but with his last Ma­jor com­ing in 2014, he can take noth­ing for granted.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of great peo­ple that have played this game that have never won a Green Jacket,” the world No. 5 said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a fore­gone con­clu­sion, and I know that. I have to go out and earn it.”</p>
    <p>McIl­roy, how­ever, brushed off sug­ges­tions that DeCham­beau’s un­prece­dented power game will blud­geon the field, in­sist­ing “there is still a lot of dif­fer­ent as­pects that you need to master in this game”.</p>
    <p>Jon Rahm also knows it is time he adds a first Ma­jor to his re­sume.</p>
    <p>The world No. 2 will play along­side sixth-ranked DeCham­beau in the first two rounds and has en­joyed a block­buster year – he clinched the BMW Cham­pi­onship and Memo­rial, and had a brief stint at the top of the rank­ings.</p>
    <p>Forty years af­ter Seve Balles­teros claimed Spain’s first Masters vic­tory, Rahm wants to follow in his foot­steps and bring home a sixth green jacket for his coun­try, par­tic­u­larly as com­pa­triot and 2017 Masters winner Ser­gio Gar­cia was ear­lier this week ruled out due to a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>“There’s such (a) Span­ish his­tory of cham­pi­ons here, with three great cham­pi­ons (in­clud­ing Jose Maria Olaz­a­bal) and three idols of mine, that I would love to be able to add my name to that list,” he said. “Es­pe­cially this year, be­ing a lit­tle bit sad that Ser­gio is not go­ing to be able to be part of this. My heart goes out to him.</p>
    <p>“You don’t need to play per­fect golf to win at Au­gusta Na­tional. You just need to stay true to your­self and just play the best you can with what you have at the mo­ment. I’ve erred about be­ing too ag­gres­sive in the past and I’ve made birdies, but I’ve also made some big num­bers.”</p>
