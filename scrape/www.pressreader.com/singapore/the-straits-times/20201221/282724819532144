    <p>Next year, my five chil­dren will be go­ing through mile­stone tran­si­tions in their ed­u­ca­tional jour­ney.</p>
    <p>My el­dest child, 20, will be com­plet­ing her polytech­nic course and is con­sid­er­ing her first ca­reer op­tions.</p>
    <p>My sec­ond and third chil­dren, 18 and 16, will need to think care­fully of their post-ter­tiary and post-sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion op­tions.</p>
    <p>My fourth child, 13, will be in Sec­ondary 2 and there will be sub­ject com­bi­na­tions he needs to choose by the end of the year. My youngest child, six, will be­gin Pri­mary 1. Our chil­dren will all have to make ad­just­ments as they em­bark on these tran­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Our el­dest, R, is go­ing into</p>
    <p>“new ter­ri­tory” for us as par­ents. She is do­ing an in­tern­ship in a multi­na­tional com­pany as part of her polytech­nic course on food science. She does not in­tend to pur­sue a univer­sity course right af­ter polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>We all know it would be a safe course of ac­tion to con­sider tak­ing up a job of­fer at the same com­pany if she is given a chance to work there af­ter her in­tern­ship, es­pe­cially in this pe­riod of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty. This would be the “nat­u­ral path of tran­si­tion”, which our own par­ents would have ad­vised us to fol­low in the past.</p>
    <p>R has other plans. She be­longs to Gen­er­a­tion Z, af­ter all. She has other in­ter­ests, such as pho­tog­ra­phy and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing. She is con­sid­er­ing an of­fer to work full time in a small on­line start-up sell­ing baby mer­chan­dise.</p>
    <p>We may be chill about the dif­fer­ent ed­u­ca­tion path­ways our chil­dren take, but it does not mean we are hands-off and do not care. As par­ents, we are quite con­cerned about R’s fu­ture. We ask our­selves (and R): “Will there be reg­u­lar or suf­fi­cient in­come? What about ca­reer prospects?”</p>
    <p>These are im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tions for us. We also know this is part of the process for R to learn to take risks. It’s not easy, but we are try­ing our best not to im­pose our ideas or wishes on her.</p>
    <p>R has to make an in­formed choice. She knows she has to learn to be more fi­nan­cially in­de­pen­dent. She also knows her strengths and pref­er­ences. She wants to pur­sue her pas­sion while she is still young and with­out much fi­nan­cial or fam­ily com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>We can only hope and pray that hav­ing raised R to make ap­pro­pri­ate de­ci­sions on im­por­tant ed­u­ca­tion path­ways, she will like­wise make a suit­able choice of her own when it comes to her first ca­reer. R has to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for that de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>I sup­pose the eas­i­est ad­just­ment for us will be for our youngest child, J, as this will be the fifth time we are go­ing to ex­pe­ri­ence the tran­si­tion to pri­mary school as par­ents.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion Kin­der­garten which J has at­tended for the past two years has pre­pared him well for the tran­si­tion. It also helps that he will be go­ing to the pri­mary school which is co-lo­cated with the kin­der­garten.</p>
    <p>He has learnt to use money for the school can­teen and his teach­ers have talked about what life would be like in a pri­mary school. They even or­gan­ised a “learn­ing jour­ney” to the pri­mary school so the kin­der­garten chil­dren would be able to ob­serve and know what to ex­pect in terms of their new en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The tran­si­tion process is a jour­ney that takes place over time and not a one-off event.</p>
    <p>A child’s tran­si­tion jour­ney be­gins well be­fore the first day of pri­mary school and may ease to a close when a child feels that he or she has adapted to life in pri­mary school. This du­ra­tion may vary for each child, de­pend­ing on his or her learn­ing and be­havioural needs.</p>
    <p>Par­ents and fam­i­lies have to work closely with the school to en­sure ev­ery child will tran­sit smoothly and find joy in go­ing to school.</p>
    <p>As par­ents, we have tried to get J ex­cited about the new school en­vi­ron­ment, such as the new play­ground and sim­ple ac­tiv­i­ties like try­ing out the new school uni­form. We are con­fi­dent that he will learn to make new friends and adapt to new teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ex­pe­ri­enced the tran­si­tion from Sec­ondary 2 to</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary 3 for three of our chil­dren, we are not anx­ious about our fourth child, K.</p>
    <p>What used to be called the stream­ing year is now known as the “Choice of Sub­ject Com­bi­na­tions”. Stu­dents are no longer placed into the science, arts, com­merce or tech­ni­cal streams. They are now given choices of sub­jects they want to take in Sec­ondary 3, de­pend­ing on their in­ter­ests, abil­i­ties and what the school is able to of­fer. In some schools, I un­der­stand that stu­dents may choose from as many 20 sub­ject com­bi­na­tions.</p>
    <p>K will have to dis­cover what he likes and is best at, in mak­ing his choices to­wards the end of the year. Of course, schools will also plan their Ed­u­ca­tion and Ca­reer Guid­ance (ECG) pro­gramme to en­sure stu­dents have op­por­tu­ni­ties to be ex­posed to the dif­fer­ent kinds of ca­reers that would match their in­ter­ests and abil­i­ties. They also need to be aware of the rel­e­vant sub­ject cour­ses they would need to pur­sue.</p>
    <p>This is why it is im­por­tant that we, as par­ents, help our chil­dren learn to make in­formed choices from a young age. These in­clude sim­ple de­ci­sions on what they want to eat and wear, and their learn­ing be­hav­iours. They also need to take re­spon­si­bil­ity for their choices.</p>
    <p>As our chil­dren grow older, they will learn to make more dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions such as how they should re­spond when faced with a con­flict with peers or how to use their time well.</p>
    <p>Our role as par­ents is to pro­vide ap­pro­pri­ate sup­port and ad­vice. As par­ents, we need to find a bal­ance. How much ad­vice do we give? What kind of sup­port can we ren­der? When is a good time to let go? We have to re­mind our­selves not to force our chil­dren into mak­ing choices against their will and to live out un­ful­filled dreams of our past.</p>
    <p>We have to let them de­cide what they would like to pur­sue based on their in­ter­ests and needs. It is, af­ter all, their fu­ture and lives.</p>
