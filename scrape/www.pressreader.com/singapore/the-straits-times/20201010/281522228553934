    <p>Aero­space clus­ter Sele­tar Aero­space Park (SAP) has, in re­cent years, been known as a hid­den foodie haven.</p>
    <p>Now, it is also home to a buzz of bio­di­ver­sity with fauna such as drag­on­flies, but­ter­flies and birds.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first wet­lands sanc­tu­ary in an in­dus­trial park – jointly de­vel­oped by JTC Cor­po­ra­tion and the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) – opened at the 320ha aero­space park in April.</p>
    <p>The 3.23ha Hamp­stead Wet­lands Park is a rus­tic sanc­tu­ary that aims to pro­vide rest and recre­ation for vis­i­tors and work­ers of the aero­space park, and is part of ef­forts to green Sin­ga­pore’s in­dus­trial es­tates.</p>
    <p>“Sele­tar Aero­space Park stands out among our in­dus­trial parks for its lush green­ery and rich his­tory,” says Ms Tang Hsiao Ling, di­rec­tor of JTC’s di­vi­sion of ur­ban de­sign and ar­chi­tec­ture, not­ing that Sele­tar’s orig­i­nal land­scape com­prised raw wet­lands and the area was a pre-World War II mil­i­tary base for the Bri­tish Royal Air Force in the 1920s.</p>
    <p>“In re­cent years, we have been work­ing more closely with NParks to green our es­tates. The wet­lands area was ear­lier des­ig­nated as a park space as part of the SAP mas­ter­plan, and de­signed in de­tail to­gether with NParks more re­cently in early 2019,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Green­ing in­dus­trial es­tates, says Ms Kar­tini Omar, NParks’ group di­rec­tor of parks de­vel­op­ment, is aligned with the agency’s vi­sion of mak­ing Sin­ga­pore a City in Na­ture, to en­sure the coun­try re­mains a highly live­able city as it con­tin­ues to ur­banise.</p>
    <p>“At Hamp­stead Wet­lands Park, we en­hanced the habi­tat and nat­u­ralised the wa­ter­logged area that was for­merly part of Sele­tar Base Golf Course,” she adds.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the grey and dusty im­age of in­dus­trial es­tates may soon be a thing of the past.</p>
    <p>Ms Kar­tini says NParks, with help from the com­mu­nity, in­tends to plant more than 100,000 trees in in­dus­trial es­tates – cur­rently among the hottest ar­eas on the is­land – over the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>This is to mit­i­gate the ur­ban heat is­land ef­fect – when an ur­ban area be­comes much warmer than the ru­ral ar­eas sur­round­ing it – and help im­prove air qual­ity and beau­tify the sur­round­ings.</p>
    <p>GREEN­ING AN AERO­SPACE PARK</p>
    <p>Hamp­stead Wet­lands Park is “an ex­am­ple of our ef­forts to re­store na­ture into the ur­ban land­scape and fur­ther nat­u­ralise the land­scapes in gar­dens and parks”, Ms Kar­tini says.</p>
    <p>The Sele­tar Air­base was handed over by the Bri­tish Royal Air Force to the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment in the 1970s. The Sele­tar Base Golf Course re­mained open to the pub­lic un­til 2007, when it was closed for the de­vel­op­ment of the aero­space park.</p>
    <p>Over time, the area be­came wa­ter­logged be­cause it sat at the low­est part of the golf course, and a small sec­ondary for­est grew.</p>
    <p>“We con­served the for­est core within the park and en­hanced the wood­land and wet­land habi­tats from the ex­ist­ing fresh­wa­ter pond,” Ms Kar­tini says.</p>
    <p>“Na­tive trees and shrubs were planted to com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing veg­e­ta­tion and pro­vide food and shel­ter for bio­di­ver­sity, in­clud­ing wa­ter-tol­er­ant and aquatic plants such as malang-malang that grow along the edges of rivers.”</p>
    <p>Na­tive species, which are well­suited to lo­cal con­di­tions, re­quire less main­te­nance as well, she adds.</p>
    <p>The land­scape in the Hamp­stead park takes on the tiered struc­ture of a for­est – from turf with sparse clus­ters of trees to medium-height</p>
    <p>shrubs to the tall, dense for­est core. Board­walks and na­ture trails are also strate­gi­cally placed to min­imise hu­man im­pact on the del­i­cate habi­tats.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can en­joy a va­ri­ety of flora and fauna such as the Blue Percher drag­on­fly, White-throated King­fisher and Blue-tailed Beeeater bird that in­habit fresh­wa­ter ecosys­tems.</p>
    <p>The park, which is con­nected to other green spa­ces via the Sele­tar West Park Con­nec­tor, is part of Sin­ga­pore’s first com­mu­nity green­ing pro­gramme for an in­dus­trial es­tate.</p>
    <p>This ini­tia­tive by JTC, NParks and the Gar­den City Fund has raised more than $125,000 from var­i­ous or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­sti­tu­tions and in­di­vid­u­als who have a pas­sion for Sele­tar and the aero­space in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>It cov­ers green­ing ef­forts in SAP and the main­te­nance of the Hamp­stead park. By plant­ing more trees and in­ten­si­fy­ing green­ery, there will be more shade to cool the es­tate, cre­at­ing a more pleas­ant en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>DIN­ING HAVEN</p>
    <p>Within strolling dis­tance from the Hamp­stead park is The Oval, a life­style des­ti­na­tion housed in 32 colo­nial black-and-white bun­ga­lows that were for­mer res­i­dences of Bri­tish of­fi­cers and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>This mix of park­lands and life­style clus­ter is part of JTC’s ef­forts to cre­ate a vi­brant live-work-play en­vi­ron­ment in an in­dus­trial es­tate.</p>
    <p>Ms Tang says: “We recog­nised the po­ten­tial to trans­form the bun­ga­lows into a unique life­style des­ti­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>JTC has re­stored the orig­i­nal look and feel of the bun­ga­lows.</p>
    <p>Un­der phase one, con­ser­va­tion works, com­pleted in 2016, were car­ried out on six bun­ga­lows so they could be fit­ted out as re­tail and din­ing es­tab­lish­ments. The next phase, com­pleted late last year, saw 13 other bun­ga­lows re­stored.</p>
    <p>The de­tailed works in­cluded test­ing for ma­te­rial strength, clean­ing and re­tain­ing of the orig­i­nal pitch roof tiles, and sourc­ing for greentinte­d em­bossed door glaz­ing from overseas sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>Large out­door swathes were re­tained to pro­vide recre­ational spa­ces for the aero­space com­mu­nity of more than 60 multi­na­tional firms and lo­cal en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors will also be able to en­joy themed events, out­door movie screen­ings and mini bazaars and car­ni­vals.</p>
    <p>The board­walk at The Oval is set against a back­drop of run­ways and air­craft hangars, pro­vid­ing views of jets land­ing and tak­ing off.</p>
    <p>There is also a spe­cially de­signed aero­space-themed play­ground for chil­dren that pays homage to Sele­tar’s avi­a­tion roots.</p>
    <p>On week­ends, it is com­mon to see fam­i­lies and friends din­ing at the colo­nial bun­ga­lows, which house an eclec­tic mix of seven food-and­bev­er­age (F&B) and re­tail out­lets.</p>
    <p>In 2016, F&B out­lets such as Youngs Bar & Restau­rant, Di Wei Teochew Restau­rant, Wheeler’s Es­tate and The Sum­mer­house were among the first to set up shop at The Oval.</p>
    <p>Pet-groom­ing house Chow Cute started oper­a­tions three months ago, and two F&B op­er­a­tors – The Sin­ga­pura Aero­space Club and 5 by Sans-Fa­con – are slated to open by the end of this year (see other story).</p>
    <p>Ob­serv­ing that more Sin­ga­pore­ans are on the look­out for off-the­beaten-track din­ing venues, Ms Tang says: “In­dus­trial es­tates some­times of­fer the best hid­den gems.”</p>
