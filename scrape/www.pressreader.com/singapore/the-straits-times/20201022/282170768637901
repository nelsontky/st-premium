    <p>The dis­cus­sion sur­round­ing China’s uni­lat­eral recla­ma­tion and mil­i­tari­sa­tion of the South China Sea is in­deed in­ter­preted dif­fer­ently by dif­fer­ent claimant and in­ter­locu­tor states (Is China the threat or the threat­ened?, by Mr Ron Ng Yong Kiang, Oct 20).</p>
    <p>Viewed through the lens of his­tor­i­cal mem­o­ries of war and de­feat, and fu­elled by state-backed na­tion­al­is­tic pro­pa­ganda, diplo­macy through rules-based res­o­lu­tion sys­tems, such as the United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea, has been dis­re­garded.</p>
    <p>It is true that the US has many mil­i­tary bases in the re­gion and reg­u­larly con­ducts joint train­ing ex­er­cises with many Asian states, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore. Let us not for­get that it was US mil­i­tary pro­jec­tion into the Pa­cific that pushed back Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion forces and ended the war in Asia.</p>
    <p>The writer thus sug­gests that it is ironic for us to be sur­prised by re­cent Chi­nese mil­i­tary ac­tions. But there is no irony when heav­ily gunned Chi­nese war­ships, white­washed as coastal pa­trol, chase away claimant states’ fish­ing ves­sels and harass sur­vey ships.</p>
    <p>Hanoi, with wounds of a bit­ter Viet­nam war still fresh, started host­ing US air­craft car­ri­ers in 2018 pre­cisely be­cause US mil­i­tary ex­changes and de­ploy­ment have been more trans­par­ent and be­nign than the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army’s as­sertive­ness.</p>
    <p>There is also no irony when China tries to di­lute Asean’s ef­forts at a mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach to re­solv­ing South China Sea dis­putes.</p>
    <p>As a small state in a geopo­lit­i­cally con­tested neigh­bour­hood, we ought to be clear-eyed about the hard re­al­i­ties of re­alpoli­tik and be aware of pro­pa­ganda in­flu­ence from over­seas.</p>
    <p>From a Sin­ga­porean per­spec­tive, we ought to sup­port our Gov­ern­ment’s re­it­er­a­tion of the rule of law in set­tling re­gional dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Small states like us have to be ac­tive and in­volved in ad­dress­ing the US-China mil­i­tary, eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal tus­sles play­ing out in Asia.</p>
