    <p>There were 10 new coro­n­avirus cases re­ported yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>This is the low­est daily fig­ure since March 12, when there were nine cases.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing On Sun­shine, a hair sa­lon in Or­chard Cen­tral, was added to a list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, added MOH.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 minutes and the times they vis­ited them to get peo­ple – who were at those places at the same time – to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>Close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The 10 new cases yes­ter­day took Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,794.</p>
    <p>They com­prised one com­mu­nity case who is a work per­mit holder, five im­ported cases and four mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Of the five im­ported cases, one Singaporea­n, one per­ma­nent res­i­dent and one de­pen­dant’s pass holder ar­rived from In­dia be­tween Sept 16 and Sept 20.</p>
    <p>A short term pass holder, who is a six-year-old girl, and a work per­mit holder ar­rived from In­done­sia on Sept 18 and Sept 20, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>All im­ported cases were placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Out of the four mi­grant work­ers, one had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as a con­tact of pre­vi­ous cases and was al­ready quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>He tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 dur­ing his quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 22 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,519 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 48 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 185 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one in the past two weeks.</p>
