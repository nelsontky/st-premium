    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS • North Korea is press­ing on with its nu­clear weapons pro­gramme and sev­eral coun­tries be­lieve it has “prob­a­bly de­vel­oped minia­turised nu­clear de­vices to fit into the war­heads of its bal­lis­tic mis­siles”, ac­cord­ing to a con­fi­den­tial UN re­port.</p>
    <p>The re­port by an in­de­pen­dent panel of ex­perts mon­i­tor­ing UN sanc­tions said the coun­tries, which it did not iden­tify, be­lieved North Korea’s past six nu­clear tests had likely helped it de­velop minia­turised nu­clear de­vices.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang has not con­ducted a nu­clear test since Septem­ber 2017. The in­terim re­port, which was seen by Reuters, was sub­mit­ted to the 15-mem­ber UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil North Korea sanc­tions com­mit­tee on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“The Demo­cratic Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of Korea is con­tin­u­ing its nu­clear pro­gramme, in­clud­ing the pro­duc­tion of highly en­riched ura­nium and con­struc­tion of an ex­per­i­men­tal light wa­ter re­ac­tor.</p>
    <p>“A mem­ber state as­sessed that the Demo­cratic Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of Korea is con­tin­u­ing pro­duc­tion of nu­clear weapons,” it said.</p>
    <p>North Korea is for­mally known as the Demo­cratic Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of Korea.</p>
    <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said last week there would be no more war as the coun­try’s nu­clear weapons guar­an­tee its safety and fu­ture de­spite un­abated out­side pres­sure and mil­i­tary threats.</p>
    <p>The UN re­port said one coun­try, which it did not iden­tify, as­sessed that North Korea “may seek to fur­ther de­velop minia­tur­i­sa­tion in or­der to al­low in­cor­po­ra­tion of tech­no­log­i­cal im­prove­ments such as pen­e­tra­tion aid pack­ages or, po­ten­tially, to de­velop mul­ti­ple war­head sys­tems”.</p>
    <p>North Korea has been sub­jected to UN sanc­tions since 2006 over its nu­clear and bal­lis­tic mis­sile programmes, and the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil has steadily strength­ened the sanc­tions in a bid to cut off fund­ing for those programmes.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim and US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on Wash­ing­ton’s calls for Py­ongyang to give up its nu­clear weapons and North Korea’s de­mands for an end to sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The UN ex­perts also said North Korea is vi­o­lat­ing sanc­tions, in­clud­ing “through il­licit mar­itime ex­ports of coal, though it sus­pended these tem­porar­ily be­tween late Jan­uary and early March 2020” due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Last year, the UN ex­perts said that North Korea had gen­er­ated an es­ti­mated US$2 bil­lion (S$2.8 bil­lion) us­ing wide­spread and so­phis­ti­cated cy­ber at­tacks to steal from banks and cryp­tocur­rency ex­changes.</p>
    <p>“The panel con­tin­ues to as­sess that vir­tual as­set ser­vice providers and vir­tual as­sets will con­tinue to re­main lu­cra­tive tar­gets for the Demo­cratic Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of Korea to gen­er­ate rev­enue, as well as min­ing cryp­tocur­ren­cies,” the lat­est re­port said.</p>
