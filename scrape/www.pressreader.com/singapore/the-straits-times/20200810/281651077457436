    <p>The de­ter­mi­na­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans to stand firm to­gether in the face of ad­ver­sity since the na­tion’s birth is why he is con­fi­dent the Repub­lic will get through the Covid-19 pan­demic, as it has pre­vi­ous crises, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Every year since the first Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) in 1966, Sin­ga­pore­ans have come to­gether with­out fail to cel­e­brate the mak­ing of this na­tion, and to re­new their com­mit­ment to it, PM Lee said in his tele­vised Na­tional Day mes­sage.</p>
    <p>De­spite the coro­n­avirus, Sin­ga­pore­ans have been de­ter­mined to still hold the NDP as a sym­bol of their unity as a na­tion – a unity more im­por­tant than ever, given the se­vere eco­nomic chal­lenges ahead, he said.</p>
    <p>“In good years, our pa­rades re­joice in our progress, and look for­ward to a bet­ter fu­ture to­gether. In dif­fi­cult years, we still hold Na­tional Day Pa­rades, to re­new our re­solve to weather the storm and take Sin­ga­pore through to bet­ter days.”</p>
    <p>This year’s NDP was also an op­por­tu­nity to salute those on the front line fight­ing Covid-19, and the many who have stepped up to help oth­ers in need, PM Lee said in his ad­dress, which came ahead of the scaled-down pa­rade at the Padang yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>He hailed the many who have gone be­yond the call of duty and shown great gen­eros­ity, such as re­tired doc­tors and nurses who vol­un­teered to serve at hospi­tals and mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries, don­ning per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment to do so.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of public-spir­ited Sin­ga­pore­ans also vol­un­teered to be trained in swab oper­a­tions and served in hot zones like dorms and com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties, where they were joined by mi­grant work­ers play­ing their part to sup­port th­ese oper­a­tions, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“Their help was deeply ap­pre­ci­ated by our SAF, Home Team and public of­fi­cers,” he said. “Th­ese self­less acts have made all the dif­fer­ence to our re­sponse to Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will need this unity and re­silience more than ever as the cri­sis is far from over, he added. Many coun­tries brought in­fec­tions un­der con­trol and eased re­stric­tions only to see cases surge again, some­thing that can hap­pen here too, de­spite var­i­ous pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>“It will most likely take a year or two be­fore a vac­cine is widely avail­able and the threat of the virus is blunted,” he said. “Un­til then, we have to main­tain our vig­i­lance and re­solve, to keep our­selves, our loved ones and our neigh­bours all safe.”</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic cli­mate will also be tough in the near term, with busi­ness clo­sures, re­trench­ments and un­em­ploy­ment all likely to go up in the com­ing months. Sin­ga­pore­ans are thus un­der­stand­ably anx­ious and wor­ried, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore has weath­ered mul­ti­ple eco­nomic crises in the last quar­ter-cen­tury alone, in­clud­ing the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1997, the af­ter­math of the Sept 11 ter­ror­ist at­tacks in the United States in 2001, and the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008.</p>
    <p>“Each time the out­look was omi­nous, and we feared the worst, but each time we worked hard to se­cure our po­si­tion, grit­ted our teeth, and came through to­gether,” he said. “I am con­fi­dent we will get through this cur­rent cri­sis too, though it may take longer. All of us must do our part, but none of us will be alone.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee out­lined how the Govern­ment is ac­tively help­ing peo­ple find new jobs and ac­quire new skills, with the Jobs Sup­port Scheme and Self-em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme to ease the bur­den on em­ploy­ers and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>The l abour move­ment is also work­ing with em­ploy­ers to cre­ate job train­ing pro­grammes and ca­reer path­ways. “It will en­sure that every worker is treated fairly and with dig­nity, es­pe­cially when job losses can­not be avoided,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers too must make every ef­fort to keep their work­ers, and not drop them at the first sign of trouble. This will build loy­alty, and nity and Youth Min­is­ter Ed­win Tong, who said Na­tional Day this year was no less mean­ing­ful for be­ing held in a de­cen­tralised man­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said: “It rep­re­sents a com­mu­nity, how we live to­gether, how we play to­gether, and the vi­sion that we have for the fu­ture, the com­mu­nity we want to build, and how we want to age to­gether as well.”</p>
    <p>Lead­ers at other lo­ca­tions echoed en­cour­age the em­ploy­ees to help their em­ploy­ers re­build when con­di­tions im­prove,” he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, who has at­tended al­most every NDP since the first in 1966, also re­called be­ing on the Padang as it rained dur­ing the 1968 pa­rade.</p>
    <p>“The rain poured down, but the con­tin­gents stood steady, and marched past proudly, drenched, yet un­daunted,” he said.</p>
    <p>Then a stu­dent at Catholic High School, PM Lee played the clar­inet in the com­bined schools brass band. Found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew had de­cided the show would go on that year, de­spite the tor­ren­tial down­pour.</p>
    <p>“We showed our­selves and the world that Sin­ga­pore­ans were rugged peo­ple, and had the steel in us to stand firm in ad­ver­sity,” said PM Lee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Grim and hard as the na­tion’s fight against Covid-19 has been, the ex­pe­ri­ence has brought Sin­ga­pore­ans closer to­gether and will deepen their bonds as one united peo­ple, the same way sep­a­ra­tion from Malaysia and in­de­pen­dence had tem­pered the Pioneer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>“Let us brace our­selves for the tri­als ahead, so that many years from now, when our grand­chil­dren cel­e­brate Na­tional Day, they will look back on th­ese times and say yes, this gen­er­a­tion stood to­gether, sac­ri­ficed for one another, and built Sin­ga­pore for us.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee added: “Let us show the world that what­ever the chal­lenges, Sin­ga­pore­ans will stay united, and pre­vail once more.” their sen­ti­ments. At North Vista Sec­ondary School, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong thanked all ed­u­ca­tors at a cer­e­mony also at­tended by Sengkang GRC MPs Ja­mus Lim and Louis Chua, both from the WP.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who also co-chairs the multi-min­istry Covid-19 task force, said while “Sin­ga­pore To­gether” is a com­mon re­frain, the pan­demic has made it more mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>He said: “We have been tested in the cru­cible but we have not failed. We have pre­vailed, and we have emerged stronger as a na­tion.”</p>
    <p>At the NTUC FairPrice Hub in Joo Koon, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said this year’s Na­tional Day is a very spe­cial one for all Sin­ga­pore­ans. He paid trib­ute to es­sen­tial ser­vice work­ers who have “worked qui­etly be­hind the scenes</p>
