    <p>The eco­nomic sup­port mea­sures be­ing rolled out dur­ing the cur­rent cri­sis could save around</p>
    <p>155,000 jobs over this year and the next, cush­ion­ing the rise in res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment by about 1.7 per­cent­age points this year, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic sup­port mea­sures be­ing rolled out dur­ing the cur­rent cri­sis could save around 155,000 jobs over this year and the next, cush­ion­ing the rise in the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate by about 1.7 per­cent­age points this year, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More than half of the jobs saved are due to the Jobs Sup­port Scheme alone, he said, adding that there will still be job losses.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Authority of Sin­ga­pore has also es­ti­mated that the four com­bined Bud­gets will pre­vent the econ­omy from con­tract­ing by a fur­ther 5.6 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct this year, and 4.8 per cent next year, he added.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing Par­lia­ment ahead of a third Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply Bill, Mr Heng said Sin­ga­pore’s plan is not sim­ply to get through the pan­demic. The ob­jec­tive at this “crit­i­cal junc­ture” is to gain ground that will pave the way for the coun­try’s next lap of eco­nomic growth over the next five to 10 years, he said.</p>
    <p>Lay­ing out the Gov­ern­ment’s plans for growth, Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, added: “Let me stress that ev­ery­thing this Gov­ern­ment does to pro­tect, re­open and grow our econ­omy – we do, not for the econ­omy’s sake, but for our peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“We strive to se­cure a way for Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue to make a good liv­ing, so that Sin­ga­pore­ans can have a good life. This is our guid­ing prin­ci­ple.”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Mr Heng an­nounced that an­other $8 bil­lion would be spent to save jobs, cre­ate new ones and seize new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The third Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply Bill, which pro­vides for this, will go through the usual par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings. It is sched­uled to be de­bated by MPs next week, and has to be as­sented to by the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In his speech yes­ter­day, Mr Heng out­lined Sin­ga­pore’s progress in its fight against Covid-19. The mul­ti­min­is­te­rial task force han­dling the cri­sis will re­lease more de­tails on the third and fi­nal stage of the coun­try’s phased re­open­ing in the com­ing weeks, he said.</p>
    <p>He also pledged to con­tinue sup­port­ing house­holds and added that sup­port for busi­nesses and work­ers will not taper off too sharply, even as Sin­ga­pore shifts its ap­proach to help­ing save jobs and firms.</p>
    <p>On top of this, sev­eral sup­port schemes will be fur­ther en­hanced to help firms in hard-hit sec­tors, as well as those which are grow­ing amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also laid out Sin­ga­pore’s re­freshed, longer-term eco­nomic strat­egy which builds on the ex­ist­ing in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps to re­struc­ture var­i­ous sec­tors.</p>
    <p>First, Sin­ga­pore will build up its role at the heart of Asia’s growth, while forg­ing con­nec­tiv­ity with other key mar­kets, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>It also in­cludes re­build­ing phys­i­cal con­nec­tiv­ity in travel and trade, and strength­en­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung will share more de­tails to­day in his min­is­te­rial state­ment on Sin­ga­pore’s plans to re­vive its air hub and re­store con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the coun­try will re­dou­ble its ef­forts to fos­ter in­clu­sive growth. Not­ing that Covid-19 has re­vealed vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties i n Sin­ga­pore’s labour mar­ket, Mr Heng said it is nec­es­sary to bet­ter un­der­stand its struc­ture, and up­grade jobs and skills across all seg­ments.</p>
    <p>But it will still be nec­es­sary to bring in global tal­ent to com­ple­ment lo­cal tal­ent, even as Sin­ga­pore care­fully up­dates its for­eign work­force poli­cies, he added.</p>
    <p>“By build­ing on com­ple­men­tary strengths, we can build cut­tingedge ca­pa­bil­i­ties in our work­force and our firms, and plug into global net­works. This will ul­ti­mately ben­e­fit all Sin­ga­porean work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Last, it will in­vest in eco­nomic re­silience and sus­tain­abil­ity as a source of com­pet­i­tive advantage. This in­cludes pro­duc­ing es­sen­tial sup­plies lo­cally, and ramp­ing up de­ploy­ment of re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng re­it­er­ated that there are no plans to draw on past re­serves for this lat­est sup­port pack­age, be­yond what was ap­proved ear­lier.</p>
    <p>To fund its Covid-19 re­sponse, the Gov­ern­ment had ob­tained Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s ap­proval twice this year to draw up to $52 bil­lion from past re­serves.</p>
    <p>“We have ded­i­cated close to $100 bil­lion to sup­port our peo­ple and busi­nesses through this dif­fi­cult pe­riod. As we do so, we must be care­ful not to spend in a way that squan­ders what gen­er­a­tions be­fore us have painstak­ingly built up,” Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>“Our guid­ing prin­ci­ple is pru­dence, not aus­ter­ity. We will con­tinue to in­vest de­ci­sively in our na­tional pri­or­i­ties, with a deep com­mit­ment to leave be­hind a bet­ter fu­ture for our chil­dren.”</p>
