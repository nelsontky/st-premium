    <p>There are com­mon skill sets that can ap­ply across in­dus­tries, as Mr Jared Chan found when he switched from the events sec­tor to re­tail.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, 32, was a se­nior mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive in the events in­dus­try when the coron­avirus pan­demic bat­tered the sec­tor by can­celling all large-scale gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>He started ap­ply­ing his mar­ket­ing skills to his new po­si­tion at fur­ni­ture re­tailer Com­mune in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said: “The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion was hang­ing on ev­ery­one’s mind back then. It was very uncertain and ven­dors were try­ing to fig­ure things out. Ev­ery­one was very con­cerned and try­ing to make sense of things.”</p>
    <p>He added that one of the main rea­sons prompt­ing him to switch in­dus­tries was that he felt his mar­ket­ing skills could be adapt­able enough to be ap­plied across dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries, with changes to suit a par­tic­u­lar sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Start­ing out, I def­i­nitely had con­cerns on where I could pick up the in­for­ma­tion needed on the job, where do I start, and in­dus­try-spe­cific ques­tions like what are the thou­sand and one ma­te­ri­als that are used in fur­ni­ture build­ing and what sort of con­struc­tion meth­ods are ap­plied,” he said.</p>
    <p>To help him get up to speed, Mr Chan at­tended a week-long in­duc­tion course, be­fore sign­ing on for a pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for dig­i­tal op­er­a­tions tal­ents.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme helped him pick up new dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing skills and get a wider view of his new in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also feels that his new role is a wel­come chal­lenge be­cause it in­volves re­gional mar­kets, since Com­mune has stores over­seas. “I try to adopt a mind­set of adapt­abil­ity.”</p>
    <p>He said: “Of course, you need to walk be­fore you learn how to run, but the skill sets I have gained from one in­dus­try can also be brought to an­other but with the nec­es­sary tweaks to fit that.”</p>
