    <p>WASHINGTON • US Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den’s cam­paign strove on Sun­day to keep its fo­cus on the na­tion’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­ceived treat­ment for Covid-19 in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who shared a de­bate stage with Mr Trump last Tues­day, tested neg­a­tive for the virus again on Sun­day, fol­low­ing two neg­a­tive tests last Fri­day, the day Mr Trump dis­closed his in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent and his wife Jill yes­ter­day re­sumed in-per­son cam­paign­ing in Florida, where opinion polls show a tight race for the state’s cru­cial 29 elec­toral col­lege votes just weeks ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has re­peat­edly wished the Pres­i­dent a speedy re­cov­ery. But the for­mer vi­cepres­i­dent and his aides have also used Mr Trump’s pos­i­tive test to un­der­line a con­sis­tent cam­paign mes­sage: Mr Bi­den would han­dle the pan­demic bet­ter than his Repub­li­can ri­val.</p>
    <p>In a video posted on Twit­ter, Mr Trump said he had “learned a lot about Covid” while at the Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre out­side Washington. “I learned it by re­ally go­ing to school – this is the real school... And I un­der­stand it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tony Blinken, the Bi­den cam­paign’s for­eign pol­icy ad­viser, shot back that Mr Trump’s re­al­i­sa­tions about Covid-19 were “dev­as­tat­ing” at this late stage. “The time to do that was 200K deaths ago, not when it af­fected you. We all wish you well but also wish you had done your job. Please do it now,” he tweeted.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign has be­gun de­scrib­ing the Pres­i­dent as a “war­rior” in mes­sages to sup­port­ers that call for dona­tions.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Mr Trump, 74, rode briefly in a mo­tor­cade out­side his hos­pi­tal to wave to sup­port­ers, ig­nit­ing crit­i­cism that he was putting oth­ers at risk.</p>
    <p>His aides have con­tin­ued to crit­i­cise Mr Bi­den’s cau­tious ap­proach to the virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Jason Miller, a Trump cam­paign senior ad­viser, mocked Mr Bi­den, 77, on Sun­day for con­sis­tently wear­ing a face mask, telling ABC’s This Week that the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial chal­lenger was us­ing masks “as a prop”.</p>
    <p>But Bi­den deputy cam­paign man­ager Kate Bed­ing­field said the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee “has led by ex­am­ple”, cit­ing the cam­paign’s use of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The United States has posted 7.4 mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases and more than 209,000 deaths in the pan­demic, more than any other coun­try.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers could judge harshly an ap­proach that con­tin­ues to down­play the se­ri­ous­ness of the virus, said Mr Kelly Di­et­rich, a Demo­cratic strate­gist and founder of the Na­tional Demo­cratic Train­ing Com­mit­tee, a group that trains party can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>“This has touched ev­ery Amer­i­can’s life,” he added.</p>
