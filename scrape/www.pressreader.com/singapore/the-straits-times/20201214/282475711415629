    <p>BREXIT NUM­BER OF BANKS THAT HAVE SIGNED UP WITH GER­MAN FI­NAN­CIAL REG­U­LA­TOR BAFIN |</p>
    <p>FRANK­FURT • Mr Hu­ber­tus Vaeth was con­sid­ered crazy when he launched a Frank­furt ini­tia­tive to lure banks there af­ter Brexit.</p>
    <p>“Are you nuts? What did you smoke?” his crit­ics asked, ac­cord­ing to the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Frank­furt Main Fi­nance (FMF) in an in­ter­view with Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>No one is laugh­ing now.</p>
    <p>More than four years af­ter the vote that took Bri­tain out of the Euro­pean Union, Frank­furt is emerg­ing the win­ner among EU fi­nan­cial cap­i­tals i n at­tract­ing Lon­don’s much-cov­eted bank­ing busi­ness, ahead of Paris, Mi­lan and Am­s­ter­dam.</p>
    <p>The Bun­des­bank es­ti­mates that non-Ger­man banks could move €675 bil­lion (S$1.1 tril­lion) to Europe’s largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>That is just over half the to­tal amount of as­sets (€1.3 tril­lion) the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank (ECB) had es­ti­mated would be trans­ferred to the euro zone from Bri­tain ahead of Brexit.</p>
    <p>Since the vote, bank­ing giants Mor­gan Stan­ley, JPMor­gan and Gold­man Sachs have said they will shift more than €350 bil­lion in com­bined as­sets from Lon­don to Ger­many.</p>
    <p>More than 60 in­ter­na­tional banks have also signed up with Ger­man fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tor BaFin.</p>
    <p>Brexit, as Mr Vaeth said, marks an “op­por­tu­nity to turn the tide” of “30 years of con­tin­u­ously los­ing busi­ness to Lon­don”.</p>
    <p>‘NEW LON­DON BRIDGE’</p>
    <p>Mr Vaeth’s cam­paign for Frank­furt went live the day af­ter the Bri­tish vote. “At 7 in the morn­ing af­ter the ref­er­en­dum, we pressed the but­ton and the cam­paign ran,” he said, pro­mot­ing them­selves as a “new Lon­don Bridge”.</p>
    <p>FMF’s es­ti­mates of up to 10,000 fi­nance jobs be­ing cre­ated in Frank­furt have so far proved over­con­fi­dent, how­ever, with lo­cal bank He­laba now pre­dict­ing 3,500.</p>
    <p>But bankers who have al­ready moved to Frank­furt be­lieve oth­ers will join them be­cause come Jan 1, Bri­tish-based fi­nan­cial firms would lose their “pass­port­ing rights” to do busi­ness with clients in the EU.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin Camp­bell, risk man­ager at a ma­jor Ja­panese bank who moved from Lon­don last year, said the slow in­flux so far is just be­cause cus­tomers haven’t yet mi­grated across to us­ing EU sub­sidiaries rather than Lon­don op­er­a­tions. “Un­der EU rules, it’s pos­si­ble for staff in Lon­don to ex­e­cute trans­ac­tions in the Euro­pean sub­sidiary from their desk in Lon­don. That ceases to be pos­si­ble on Jan 1,” he said.</p>
    <p>Banks are also wary of an­nounc­ing their move­ments be­cause “the dis­course around Brexit is so hor­rif­i­cally toxic that there’s noth­ing to be gained by a com­mer­cial or­gan­i­sa­tion mak­ing things pub­lic”, he said. “Pri­vately, all these banks are telling their cus­tomers, ‘We are in Frank­furt and we are ready for you.’ ”</p>
    <p>Mr Carsten Loll, a part­ner at con­sul­tancy Lin­klaters, be­lieves that if no trade deal is reached, in­ter­na­tional firms will rent more of­fice space in Frank­furt.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that an in­flux of post-Brexit bankers would drive up prices “crazily” for res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>‘YOU CRY TWICE’</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the switch has been vis­i­ble in the type of busi­ness be­ing done in the city, which is also home to the ECB.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Brexit, Frank­furt’s large fi­nan­cial com­mu­nity – around 65,000 bankers – was fo­cused on com­mer­cial bank­ing, not in­vest­ment bank­ing, ac­cord­ing to Mr Camp­bell.</p>
    <p>“The idea of a big in­ter­na­tional in­vest­ment bank in Frank­furt didn’t ex­ist,” he said. “So Brexit cre­ated an in­vest­ment bank­ing in­dus­try in</p>
    <p>Frank­furt from as good as noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Vaeth be­lieves that once they have made the move, the bankers won’t look back.</p>
    <p>While some dis­miss Frank­furt as bor­ing com­pared with vi­brant Lon­don, oth­ers en­joy the city of 700,000 peo­ple for its man­age­able size, easy-go­ing vibe and its close ac­cess to na­ture.</p>
    <p>“I used to com­mute over an hour into Lon­don. That’s how far I had to live out in or­der to get a place to live that I could af­ford that was the size I wanted,” said Mr Camp­bell.</p>
    <p>“Here in Frank­furt, I live in a flat that’s 20 min­utes ei­ther by bike or pub­lic trans­port to my of­fice,” adding that his wife can pop by for lunch.</p>
    <p>“When you are posted to Frank­furt, you cry twice,” Mr Vaeth chuck­led. “Once you’re posted there and once you’re posted out.”</p>
