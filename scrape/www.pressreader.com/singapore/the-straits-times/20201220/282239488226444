    <p>This was the year it be­came so­cially ac­cept­able to turn up for work in py­ja­mas.</p>
    <p>As com­pa­nies em­braced work­ing from home, dress­ing for the work­place shifted ac­cord­ingly. Many traded in crisp of­fice wear for ca­sual cloth­ing to work from home.</p>
    <p>The com­fort econ­omy is boom­ing in th­ese un­com­fort­able times. A sur­vey of Bri­tain’s on­line shop­pers by e-mar­ket­place Lovethe­sales found that de­mand for loungewear in­creased by 411 per cent in April and 122 per cent last month, com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>The global loungewear mar­ket is ex­pected to gen­er­ate US$37.7 bil­lion (S$50.2 bil­lion) in re­tail sales next year, ac­cord­ing to mar­ket and con­sumer data com­pany Statista.</p>
    <p>Re­gion­ally, lux­ury re­tailer Net-a-porter saw loungewear be­come “the new ev­ery­day uni­form and nor­mally a last-minute add-to-bag pur­chase”, with some brands such as Les Tien and Suzie Kondi sell­ing out within weeks of launch, says se­nior fash­ion mar­ket ed­i­tor Libby Page. “Our cus­tomers want com­fort that still al­lows them to feel chic and ex­cited to get dressed while work­ing from home.”</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers here were quick to ride the trend, with brands such as Pomelo, Uniqlo, H&M and homegrown Love, Bonito adding loungewear or sleep­wear cat­e­gories to their of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>The ac­cel­er­ated de­mand for loungewear came hand in hand with a re­newed in­ter­est in ac­tivewear, as more seized the chance to work out from home.</p>
    <p>In its first bi-an­nual fash­ion re­port, global re­sale re­tailer Ves­ti­aire Col­lec­tive ob­served a huge spike in loungewear and ath­leisure sales this year, with sports brands Adi­das and Nike ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in­creased sales of 71 per cent and 64 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>On­line mar­ket­place Zalora re­ported a sim­i­lar uptick in in­ter­est for sports­wear, with shop­pers spend­ing more on sports per­for­mance and life­style tops. In its in­au­gu­ral data in­sights re­port, it also found that ac­tivewear and loungewear had triple-digit growth in the last two quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ac­tivewear play­ers, in­clud­ing Ky­dra and GlowCo, have seen an in­creased de­mand for work­out gear; while new la­bels founded this year such as Re­vive&Co and F Brand are muscling in for a piece of the ac­tion.</p>
