    <p>Some shop­ping malls strug­gle to com­ply with fire safety rules even as they abide by Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>A few have re­sorted to pad­lock­ing their en­try and exit points to com­ply with oc­cu­pancy lim­its im­posed by the author­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to The Straits Times’ queries, the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) said that as at Aug 31, 16 out of the 200 malls it in­spected had breached fire safety re­quire­ments by pad­lock­ing a few of their doors.</p>
    <p>The malls were is­sued warn­ings, $300 fines, or both, and they have since rec­ti­fied the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>One of the malls found to have flouted fire safety rules was Peo­ple’s Park Cen­tre, said the SCDF, though it de­clined to name the other 15 malls.</p>
    <p>When ST vis­ited the mall last Thurs­day, all its ex­its were found un­locked, with re­mov­able bar­ri­cades placed in front of them.</p>
    <p>Signs were placed on the bar­ri­cades in­di­cat­ing that these are re­mov­able in the case of an emer­gency evac­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But an­other is­sue was noted on the build­ing’s third storey, where pa­trons were seen skirt­ing these bar­ri­ers to ac­cess the doors for en­try to and exit from the mall.</p>
    <p>In­spec­tions by ST found that the door­way opened into a cor­ri­dor of shops which were ac­ces­si­ble only from the mall’s ex­te­rior.</p>
    <p>The cor­ri­dor is linked to an over­head bridge con­nect­ing Peo­ple’s Park Cen­tre to Chi­na­town Point.</p>
    <p>Own­ers of shops along that row whom ST spoke to said they have been starved of cus­tomers since the en­try re­stric­tions were im­posed to curb the spread of Covid-19, with foot­fall re­duced to close to zero.</p>
    <p>Mr Izat Norozad, 65, who owns Mus­lim eatery Warung Aneka Rasa, said the lunchtime crowd has dis­si­pated since the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, and reg­u­lars no longer fre­quent the eatery as much due to its in­ac­ces­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers and shop­keep­ers alike are able to ac­cess the row of shops only via a flight of stairs lo­cated near a side en­trance of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>“Many of my cus­tomers are older folks, and climb­ing three flights of stairs is too tir­ing, so they pre­fer to dine at eater­ies lo­cated on the lower lev­els in­stead,” said Mr Izat, whose busi­ness is now 30 per cent of what it used to be.</p>
    <p>An­other shop owner who wanted to be known only as Mr Tang, whose shop is in­side the mall but right next to the exit, said he has been fre­quent­ing food­courts in­side the mall in­stead of the eater­ies along that row af­ter the doors were locked.</p>
    <p>“On the one hand, keep­ing the door locked has im­pacted all these busi­nesses and it is a haz­ard to fire safety, but leav­ing it un­locked and un­manned could pose a haz­ard to pub­lic health, es­pe­cially if there are Covid-19 cases who could en­ter and leave the mall un­traced,” said the 70-year-old.</p>
    <p>ST has con­tacted the mall’s man­age­ment for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Strata Man­agers, Mr Chan Kok Hong, said many malls have blocked their en­trances as it would re­quire a lot more se­cu­rity, man­power and equip­ment to en­sure tem­per­a­ture check­ing and SafeEn­try are car­ried out at ev­ery en­trance.</p>
    <p>He added that strata malls have been car­ry­ing out the same prac­tices as big malls and us­ing re­mov­able bar­ri­cades.</p>
    <p>Three other malls ST vis­ited in its vicin­ity ap­peared to be com­ply­ing with fire safety rules. Malls such as Fu­nan and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre have locked slid­ing doors, which can be au­to­mat­i­cally re­leased upon ac­ti­va­tion of the fire alarm.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Cap­i­taLand malls said that this ap­plies to all 19 of its malls, and that it “abides by fire safety reg­u­la­tions at all times”.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar mall Nex has five out of its 28 en­trances op­er­a­tional, each with con­trolled ac­cess in com­pli­ance with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said: “Re­main­ing ac­cess points which are not locked dur­ing mall op­er­at­ing hours are bar­ri­caded with light­weight bar­ri­cades which can be eas­ily pushed</p>
    <p>aside, and doors with elec­tro­mag­netic locks will be auto-re­leased dur­ing emer­gen­cies.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The SCDF en­force­ment team in­spected the mall on Aug 7 and is sat­is­fied with our fire safety com­pli­ance mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail said that all 14 of its malls “have im­ple­mented fire safety mea­sures and are compliant with guide­lines set out by SCDF”.</p>
