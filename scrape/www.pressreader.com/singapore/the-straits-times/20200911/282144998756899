    <p>• Four-time For­mula One world cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vettel will race for As­ton Martin, which will be Rac­ing Point’s new name from next sea­son, af­ter he leaves Fer­rari at the end of this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man yes­ter­day signed a multi-year deal with the Cana­dian-owned team and re­places Mex­i­can Ser­gio Perez, whose exit was an­nounced on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the news in a state­ment, the 33-year-old Vettel said: “It’s a new ad­ven­ture for me with a truly leg­endary car com­pany. I have been im­pressed with the re­sults the team has achieved this year and I be­lieve the fu­ture looks even brighter.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve we can build some­thing very spe­cial to­gether. I still have so much love for F1 and my only mo­ti­va­tion is to race at the front of the grid.”</p>
    <p>Vettel will join Cana­dian Lance Stroll – whose bil­lion­aire fa­ther Lawrence owns the team and is also ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of the Bri­tish lux­ury car­maker As­ton Martin. The win­ner of 53 grands prix has had a tough time at Fer­rari since the ar­rival of Charles Le­clerc, with the young Mone­gasque beat­ing him on wins, podi­ums, points and poles last sea­son, and his place in the team will be taken by McLaren’s Car­los Sainz.</p>
    <p>The Scud­e­ria, who are two places in the con­struc­tors’ stand­ings be­hind Rac­ing Point af­ter eight races, wished Vettel well.</p>
    <p>“Happy to know you’ll be around next year! Let’s fin­ish this do­ing our best to­gether,” the team tweeted ahead of Sun­day’s Tus­can Grand Prix, which will be Fer­rari’s 1,000th F1 race and also the 250th of Vettel’s ca­reer.</p>
