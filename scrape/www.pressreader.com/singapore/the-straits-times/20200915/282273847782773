    <p>Ja­pan’s na­tional rugby union team will not play again this year be­cause of safety fears re­lated to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Ja­panese Rugby Foot­ball Union (JRFU) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Head coach Jamie Joseph said Ja­pan, who had games against Eng­land and Wales can­celled ear­lier this year due to the out­break, had been due to play against Europe’s top teams in an eight-na­tion tour­na­ment later this year.</p>
    <p>The Brave Blos­soms have not played a Test match since their quar­ter-fi­nal loss to even­tual cham­pi­ons South Africa at last year’s</p>
    <p>Rugby World Cup on home soil.</p>
    <p>“We have con­cluded there will be no Test matches this year,” JRFU chair­man Ken­suke Iwabuchi told a me­dia brief­ing. “As a staff, we are think­ing proac­tively how to use the mo­men­tum of our achieve­ment at the World Cup to move for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Since sign­ing a new con­tract fol­low­ing Ja­pan’s stun­ning World Cup run, Joseph has stressed the im­por­tance of hav­ing Test matches against Tier One na­tions.</p>
    <p>“We were al­lo­cated Test matches to play in the eight na­tions,” he said. “That would have been a won­der­ful tour­na­ment to be a part of, not only this year but for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“It would give our play­ers the ex­pe­ri­ence they need to de­velop their game and test it against some of the best teams.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Top League domestic com­pe­ti­tion was can­celled ear­lier this year be­cause of the pan­demic, mean­ing most Ja­panese play­ers have barely played com­pet­i­tive rugby in the past year.</p>
    <p>Joseph added Ja­pan’s in­abil­ity to train ex­ten­sively was an­other rea­son to scrap their re­main­ing Tests.</p>
    <p>“The right de­ci­sion has been made. We still have plenty of time to pre­pare our­selves for the next</p>
    <p>World Cup,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern said yes­ter­day she was work­ing to en­sure New Zealand’s strict quar­an­tine rules do not stop the All Blacks host­ing the Wal­la­bies in the Bledis­loe Cup, set to be played on Oct 17 and 24.</p>
    <p>New Zealand last week lost host­ing rights for the Novem­ber-De­cem­ber Rugby Cham­pi­onship to Aus­tralia be­cause of strict bor­der con­trols. On sim­i­lar con­cerns about the Bledis­loe Cup, Ardern as­sured fans “we’ll be able to find a work­able so­lu­tion”.</p>
