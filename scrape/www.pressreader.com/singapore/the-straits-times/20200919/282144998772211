    <p>I re­cently re­ceived a call from a gov­ern­ment agency that I had been giv­ing feed­back to for a few years now re­gard­ing an is­sue in my neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>I had been very un­happy with its re­sponse, or lack of.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, an ac­ci­dent hap­pened just blocks away from where I live, show­ing that what I was con­cerned about could, and did, hap­pen. And so I wrote in again.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, about a week later, an of­fi­cer from that unit called. We had a good talk dur­ing which he ex­plained the op­er­a­tional, lo­gis­ti­cal and le­gal con­straints it faced in solv­ing the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>I learnt that the sim­ple so­lu­tion I had pro­posed could not be im­ple­mented as it would have in­volved some ma­jor re­design, and short of tear­ing down and re­build­ing the whole es­tate, there was lit­tle of­fi­cials could do other than con­tinue with the cur­rent prac­tice.</p>
    <p>I ap­pre­ci­ated that phone call as it gave me a clearer pic­ture of the whole sit­u­a­tion, although it would have been bet­ter had I been told this any time in the last three years af­ter I first high­lighted the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>My point is, the man in the street is not privy to in­for­ma­tion at the gov­ern­ment agency level. We will not know what is hap­pen­ing, or why some­thing is not hap­pen­ing, if no one ex­plains it to us.</p>
    <p>All of us want a safe and bet­ter liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment. I am sure this can be achieved when gov­ern­ment agen­cies and or­di­nary ci­ti­zens can com­mu­ni­cate clearly with each other. We can then avoid a sit­u­a­tion where ci­ti­zens are up­set at the seem­ing in­ac­tion of gov­ern­ment agen­cies, and public of­fi­cers are ha­rassed by these ir­ri­tated ci­ti­zens.</p>
