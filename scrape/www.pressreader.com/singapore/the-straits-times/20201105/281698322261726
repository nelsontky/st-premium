    <p>LON­DON • Face­book and Twitter flagged some of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s posts on the US election as votes were still be­ing counted, in a real-time test of their rules on han­dling mis­in­for­ma­tion and pre­ma­ture claims of vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Twitter also ap­plied la­bels to posts by Demo­cratic and Republican of­fi­cials in the bat­tle­ground states of Wis­con­sin and Florida, warning users that the in­for­ma­tion may be con­tested or in­ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia com­pa­nies have been un­der fierce scru­tiny over how they po­lice rapidly spread­ing false in­for­ma­tion and election-re­lated abuses of their plat­forms. In the weeks be­fore Tues­day’s vote, both firms vowed ac­tion on posts by can­di­dates try­ing to de­clare early vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Early yes­ter­day, Twitter hid a Trump tweet that claimed “we are up big, but they are try­ing to steal the election” be­hind a la­bel that said it was po­ten­tially mis­lead­ing. The com­pany also re­stricted users’ abil­ity to share the post.</p>
    <p>Face­book added a la­bel to the same post, which had about 18,000 shares, that said “fi­nal re­sults may be dif­fer­ent from ini­tial vote counts as bal­lot count­ing will con­tinue for days or weeks”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Face­book said it was not re­strict­ing the reach or shar­ing of la­belled con­tent. She also said it would not flag pre­ma­ture claims of state wins, only of the fi­nal re­sult of the pres­i­den­tial race. Twitter did not la­bel a sep­a­rate post, in which Mr Trump de­clared “A big win!”, to which Face­book added a no­tice that said votes were still be­ing counted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Twitter did flag early vic­tory claims by state-level of­fi­cials from both par­ties.</p>
    <p>After the chair of the Demo­cratic Party of Wis­con­sin tweeted that Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den had se­cured vic­tory in his state, Twitter at­tached a no­tice say­ing: “Some or all of the con­tent shared in this tweet is dis­puted and might be mis­lead­ing about an election or other civic process.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany also flagged ear­lier posts by a Republican sen­a­tor and gov­er­nor which claimed vic­tory for Mr Trump in Florida be­fore the re­sult was con­firmed.</p>
    <p>Face­book said that fol­low­ing Mr Trump’s pre­ma­ture claims of vic­tory, it had started run­ning top-of-feed no­ti­fi­ca­tions on Face­book and its photo-shar­ing site Instagram telling users that votes were still be­ing counted and no win­ner had been pro­jected. It said au­to­matic la­bels were also be­ing ap­plied to both can­di­dates’ posts with this in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>False or ex­ag­ger­ated re­ports about vot­ing fraud and de­lays at the polls also cir­cu­lated on so­cial me­dia on election day, in some cases helped along by of­fi­cial Republican ac­counts and on­line pub­li­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>(Face­book and Twitter) have been un­der fierce scru­tiny over how they po­lice rapidly spread­ing false in­for­ma­tion and election-re­lated abuses of their plat­forms. In the weeks be­fore Tues­day’s vote, both vowed ac­tion on posts by can­di­dates try­ing to de­clare early vic­tory.</p>
