    <p>Prop­erty com­pany UOL has sunk into the red with net losses of $82.1 mil­lion for its first half ended June 30, com­pared with a net profit of $267.7 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>This was due mainly to fair value losses on its in­vest­ment prop­er­ties, in­clud­ing re­tail malls and ser­viced suites which were se­verely af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic, it said.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing fair value losses, the group’s op­er­a­tions re­mained in the black, with group pre-tax profit to­talling $196.8 mil­lion, down 30 per cent from $282.8 mil­lion in the first half of FY2019.</p>
    <p>The group’s in­vest­ment prop­er­ties were in­de­pen­dently val­ued at a com­bined $11.3 bil­lion as at endJune, rep­re­sent­ing a $263.8 mil­lion or 2 per cent de­cline from the value as at end-De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The de­cline in value was ob­served across all of the group’s com­mer­cial prop­er­ties and ser­viced suites, and re­flected the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on the per­for­mance of these prop­er­ties, it said.</p>
    <p>The earn­ings de­cline also came on the back of a 28 per cent drop in rev­enue to $908.2 mil­lion, with the big­gest hit seen in the ho­tel own­er­ship and op­er­a­tions seg­ment, where rev­enue fell 57 per cent to $136.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This was due to the group’s ho­tels be­ing af­fected by the lock­downs and travel re­stric­tions im­posed by gov­ern­ments around the world, with Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia ho­tels see­ing the largest de­cline.</p>
    <p>It was com­pounded by the clo­sure of Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Ma­rina Bay and Parkroyal Kuala Lumpur for ma­jor re­fur­bish­ments and the ab­sence of rev­enue from Pan Pa­cific Suzhou, which was sold last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from the prop­erty de­vel­op­ment seg­ment was 29 per cent lower at $379.7 mil­lion, as the rev­enue from Park Eleven in Shang­hai for the first half of last year was sig­nif­i­cantly higher due to the large num­ber of units handed over in the first quar­ter of last year.</p>
    <p>The de­cline was off­set par­tially by higher pro­gres­sive rev­enue recog­ni­tion from on­go­ing projects in Sin­ga­pore, mainly Av­enue South Res­i­dence in Si­lat Av­enue and The Tre Ver in Po­tong Pasir.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue from its prop­erty in­vest­ments fell by 14 per cent to $238.8 mil­lion, due mainly to rental re­bates of $26.3 mil­lion ex­tended to ten­ants af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Shares of UOL added half a Sin­ga­pore cent or 0.8 per cent to $6.64 yesterday.</p>
