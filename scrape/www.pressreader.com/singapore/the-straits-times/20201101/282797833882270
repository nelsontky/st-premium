    <p>At first, some of Mr Sim Teck Yee’s friends and fam­ily mem­bers were not too happy that he joined the fu­neral-ser­vice in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>That was five years ago when he lost his lo­gis­tics job. But they have since come around.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple in his gen­er­a­tion are “pan­tang”, said Mr Sim, us­ing the Malay word for su­per­sti­tious.</p>
    <p>“This is a very spe­cial job. You need to be very knowl­edge­able. It’s a sales job, a cus­tomer ser­vice job – and yet it’s an emo­tional job,” said the 49-year-old fu­neral di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>As head of case man­agers at Direct Fu­neral Ser­vices (DFS), he han­dles their ros­ter and ex­e­cutes new pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Case man­agers, or fu­neral di­rec­tors, co­or­di­nate ev­ery­thing from lo­gis­tics to ex­ter­nal ven­dors.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim han­dles about 20 cases and earns about $10,000 a month, in­clud­ing quar­terly bonuses, when the com­pany is do­ing well.</p>
    <p>The job can be tir­ing and fast­paced so not every­one may find it suit­able, said Mr Sim. Case man­agers work of­fice hours but take turns to be on standby at night.</p>
    <p>“In this line, there’s no ‘no work­ing over­time’ be­cause you can’t pre­dict how many peo­ple will die in the next hour,” he said.</p>
    <p>Though the hours are un­pre­dictable and emo­tions can run high, he finds it truly mean­ing­ful to help peo­ple give their fam­ily mem­bers a dig­ni­fied farewell.</p>
    <p>One case he said he will never for­get hap­pened about three years ago. The par­ents of a dead child re­quested a cheer­ful set-up, with Mickey Mouse bal­loons and bright colours. Mr Sim made it hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“It looked like a Mc­Don­ald’s birth­day party,” he said. “The par­ents still cried but they wanted the kid to have a good send-off.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sim, who has a diploma in nurs­ing and was an army reg­u­lar for 20 years, stum­bled into the job by chance. He bumped into DFS founder Roland Tay, who was his ac­quain­tance, on the day he lost his pre­vi­ous job.</p>
    <p>He started as a pall­bearer and worked his way up, in­clud­ing do­ing stints in the lo­gis­tics and sales de­part­ments. The learn­ing curve was steep, as there are dif­fer­ent cus­toms, chants and rit­u­als that need to be ar­ranged based on the dead per­son’s re­li­gion. He learnt by ask­ing col­leagues or re­li­gious par­ties, like priests or monks.</p>
    <p>In the last five years, he has seen the in­dus­try change as younger cus­tomers care about aes­thet­ics too, and not just tra­di­tion. “Cus­tomers say their friends walk in and say it doesn’t seem like a fu­neral. Peo­ple don’t feel so stressed and sad when they at­tend wakes,” he said.</p>
    <p>Younger peo­ple are also get­ting in­ter­ested in the work, he noted, adding that even de­gree-hold­ers are join­ing the firm as pall­bear­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said the most im­por­tant qual­i­ties in the line are em­pa­thy and com­pas­sion. An event man­age­ment and cus­tomer ser­vice back­ground also helps.</p>
    <p>“It is get­ting more com­pet­i­tive... Now, a lot of peo­ple want to work in a field that is pur­pose­ful and mean­ing­ful which al­lows them to help peo­ple,” he added.</p>
