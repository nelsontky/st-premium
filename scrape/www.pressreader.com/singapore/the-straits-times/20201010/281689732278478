    <p>Tech­nol­ogy firms are still keen to set up shop or ex­pand in Sin­ga­pore, with multi­na­tion­als forg­ing ahead with ex­pan­sion and hir­ing plans amid height­ened global de­mand.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal gi­ants, in par­tic­u­lar, are con­tin­u­ing to in­vest here, noted the Euro­pean Cham­ber of Com­merce (Sin­ga­pore).</p>
    <p>EuroCham pres­i­dent Fed­erico Donato said: “Cer­tain com­pa­nies have con­tin­ued hir­ing in Sin­ga­pore even dur­ing the pan­demic be­cause Sin­ga­pore re­mains their main of­fice for business pur­poses in Asia.</p>
    <p>“Fin­tech firms, for in­stance, find them­selves es­tab­lish­ing an of­fice in Sin­ga­pore if they in­tend to pen­e­trate the Asian mar­ket. Many com­pa­nies are re­lo­cat­ing re­sources in and around Asia. Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to be se­lected for cus­tomer-fac­ing or core business pur­poses, while neigh­bour­ing coun­tries are pre­ferred for back-of­fice ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Tech multi­na­tion­als told The Straits Times that they have ex­panded their fa­cil­i­ties here while look­ing for fresh tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Among them is semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­turer Glob­alFoundrie­s Sin­ga­pore. Miss Janice Lee, its vicepres­i­dent and hu­man re­sources lead for in­ter­na­tional fab oper­a­tions, said: “Sin­ga­pore re­mains a vi­tal and strate­gic site in our over­all com­pany di­rec­tion given (its) decades of semi­con­duc­tor ex­pe­ri­ence... as well as (its) tal­ent pool and ex­per­tise in wafer foundry.”</p>
    <p>Life sci­ence tools man­u­fac­turer Il­lu­mina is also hir­ing as it ex­pands its foot­print in Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>It will oc­cupy 50,000 sq ft when con­struc­tion is com­pleted next July to ac­com­mo­date the grow­ing re­search and de­vel­op­ment team.</p>
    <p>Its fa­cil­ity here is the com­pany’s largest pro­duc­tion op­er­a­tion glob­ally, while the re­search and de­vel­op­ment team has grown by about 20 per cent to 30 per cent a year over the past five years. Sin­ga­pore has built a strong tal­ent pool in re­search and de­vel­op­ment, it noted.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can chip­maker Mi­cron is also adding to its 8,000-strong work­force here. It com­pleted an ex­pan­sion of its fa­cil­ity in Au­gust last year. Its two wafer fabs and one assem­bly and test fa­cil­ity serve as the base for its world­wide oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Zer­linda Tan, di­rec­tor of tal­ent ac­qui­si­tion, said: “By hir­ing the ex­per­tise we need for the fu­ture, we are po­si­tion­ing Mi­cron to emerge stronger and will con­tinue to in­vest and build our tal­ent.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Donato said Sin­ga­pore must keep fight­ing to re­main rel­e­vant. “Even though Sin­ga­pore will re­main pos­i­tive, we can­not make the mis­take of tak­ing this for granted and think that such an advantage does not risk to be eroded.”</p>
