    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Po­lice in Aus­tralia’s coro­n­avirus hot spot state of Vic­to­ria stepped up pa­trolling yes­ter­day as hun­dreds of peo­ple in the city of Mel­bourne breached strin­gent lock­down re­stric­tions and flocked to beaches on the warm­est week­end in months.</p>
    <p>Un­der the re­stric­tions, nearly five mil­lion peo­ple in Mel­bourne, Vic­to­ria’s cap­i­tal, may ex­er­cise or so­cialise out­doors for a max­i­mum of two hours a day, but must stay close to home.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must wear masks in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>How­ever, tele­vi­sion and so­cial me­dia footage showed crowds, many peo­ple with­out masks, at some of Mel­bourne’s beaches as tem­per­a­tures soared ahead of sum­mer in the south­ern hemi­sphere.</p>
    <p>“A num­ber of fines were is­sued to peo­ple who breached di­rec­tions... and Vic­to­ria Po­lice will be con­duct­ing in­creased pa­trols of pop­u­lar pub­lic spa­ces this week­end,” po­lice said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Fines for not wear­ing masks reach A$200 (S$195) and fines for breach­ing pub­lic health or­ders are more than A$1,600.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews said the be­hav­iour of the beach-go­ers was un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>“Spend­ing time at the beach with­out a mask, with­out so­cial dis­tanc­ing now, will just mean that you won’t get to go to the beach for all of sum­mer,” Mr An­drews said at a tele­vised brief­ing.</p>
    <p>State of­fi­cials said eight peo­ple had been di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus in the past 24 hours and three more peo­ple had died.</p>
    <p>The num­bers have been go­ing steadily down after reach­ing more than 700 in new daily cases at their peak in July.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne has been un­der a strict lock­down for months, with the mea­sures set to re­main in place un­til the av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases over a two-week win­dow falls be­low five. Yes­ter­day, it was 12.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria, Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state, ac­counts for 90 per cent of na­tional Covid-19 deaths.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, with 893 fatal­i­ties, has fared far bet­ter than many other de­vel­oped coun­tries.</p>
