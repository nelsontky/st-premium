    <p>We as Euro­peans act in close co­op­er­a­tion – we of­fer our in­ter­na­tional part­ners re­spect, and we ex­pect the ex­act same from them. Threats don’t fit in here.</p>
    <p>GER­MAN FOR­EIGN MINISTER HEIKO MAAS, speak­ing on Tues­day at a brief­ing in Ber­lin along­side China’s For­eign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
    <p>BER­LIN • Ger­man Chancellor An­gela Merkel’s top diplo­mat warned China’s For­eign Minister Wang Yi against mak­ing “threats” to­wards Euro­pean al­lies, as Mr Wang re­in­forced his ac­cu­sa­tion that a Czech law­maker’s visit to Tai­wan had crossed a red line.</p>
    <p>On the fi­nal stop of Mr Wang’s five-na­tion swing through Europe, he was con­fronted by Ger­man For­eign Af­fairs Minister Heiko Maas for say­ing that the Czech Sen­ate pres­i­dent would pay a “heavy price” for his Tai­wan visit.</p>
    <p>Mr Maas said he had spo­ken by phone with his Czech coun­ter­part and em­pha­sised that Europe would not be in­tim­i­dated.</p>
    <p>“We as Euro­peans act in close co­op­er­a­tion – we of­fer our in­ter­na­tional part­ners re­spect, and we ex­pect the ex­act same from them,” Mr Maas said on Tues­day, at a 50-minute media brief­ing in Ber­lin along­side Mr Wang. “Threats don’t fit in here,” Mr Maas added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang stood his ground, say­ing that the one-China prin­ci­ple serves as the po­lit­i­cal foun­da­tion of China-Czech re­la­tions, and that Czech Sen­ate pres­i­dent Mi­los Vys­tr­cil’s visit was an in­ter­ven­tion in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs and a vi­o­la­tion to which the gov­ern­ment in Bei­jing had to re­spond.</p>
    <p>“China must tell the Czech Sen­ate pres­i­dent, you’ve crossed the line,” Mr Wang said, re­fer­ring to Mr Vys­tr­cil and his 90-mem­ber del­e­ga­tion, in­clud­ing Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang said that China is the vic­tim rather than the trou­ble­maker, not­ing that with re­gard to safe­guard­ing na­tional sovereignt­y and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity, China must lay out its clear stand.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the brief­ing, Mr Wang was also pres­sured on China’s</p>
    <p>CROSSED A RED LINE</p>
    <p>China must tell the Czech Sen­ate pres­i­dent: You’ve crossed a red line.</p>
    <p>MR WANG YI, speak­ing at the same brief­ing.</p>
    <p>stance on Hong Kong, the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, his as­sertive com­ments dur­ing his week-long Euro­pean tour and China’s treat­ment of eth­nic Uighurs in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang is­sued an ex­tended de­fence of Chi­nese pol­icy, re­it­er­at­ing warn­ings that ac­cu­sa­tions against Bei­jing con­sti­tute an in­ter­ven­tion in the coun­try’s in­ter­nal af­fairs. He</p>
    <p>also de­nied that China sought to dis­rupt re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The ten­sions over­shad­owed is­sues in­clud­ing a Euro­pean UnionChina in­vest­ment ac­cord, which Dr Merkel’s gov­ern­ment had aimed to com­plete by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Maas said the 27-mem­ber bloc would assert its sovereignt­y and would not be­come a “play thing” as the United States, China</p>
    <p>and Rus­sia shake geopo­lit­i­cal foun­da­tions.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Mr Maas said the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion is a pri­or­ity of Ger­man for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>He said Ger­many wanted to strengthen its re­la­tions with that part of the world and help shape the or­der “so that it is based on rules and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, not on the law of the strong”.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang had started the Euro­pean trip say­ing re­la­tions with Europe should not suf­fer due to Bei­jing’s in­ten­si­fy­ing stand-off with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has touted his strong stance against China.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang said China and the EU are fac­ing an im­por­tant op­por­tu­nity to de­velop bet­ter bi­lat­eral re­la­tions.</p>
