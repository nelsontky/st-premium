    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Af­ter sev­eral weeks of rapidly ris­ing Covid-19 cases, hos­pi­tals around the United States, es­pe­cially in the Midwest, were once again over­whelmed, forc­ing the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to take new mea­sures to cope.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, a record 65,368 peo­ple were in the hos­pi­tal with Covid-19 in the US, mark­ing the sec­ond day in a row and sec­ond time ever that the tally passed the 60,000 mark, ac­cord­ing to the Covid Track­ing Project.</p>
    <p>In Texas, of­fi­cials in the county of El Paso have brought in 10 tem­po­rary re­frig­er­ated morgue trail­ers to con­tend with one of the worst Covid-19 spikes in the coun­try. More than 1,000 peo­ple were hos­pi­talised in the county alone, a sub­stan­tial por­tion of the state’s nearly 6,800 hospi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases in Texas – which ex­ceeded one mil­lion – was so high that the state gov­ern­ment re­quested a mil­i­tary med­i­cal cen­tre be con­verted for in­take of non-Covid-19 pa­tients in or­der to free up space in hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>In Mary­land, state of­fi­cials said more than 800 peo­ple were be­ing treated for Covid-19 at state hos­pi­tals as of Wed­nes­day, the state’s high­est daily count since April.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases prompted state gov­ern­ments to tighten re­stric­tions on res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>New York Gov­er­nor Andrew Cuomo on Wed­nes­day im­posed a new round of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to pro­tect a state that was the epi­cen­tre of the US out­break in its early stages.</p>
    <p>Any es­tab­lish­ment in the state with a liquor li­cence, in­clud­ing bars and restau­rants, would have to close by 10pm from to­day.</p>
    <p>The state re­ported 4,820 new in­fec­tions on Wed­nes­day, the most since April. It also has 1,628 peo­ple hos­pi­talised for Covid-19, twice as many as a month ago.</p>
    <p>The US con­tam­i­na­tion curve has un­der­gone three no­table waves: a first in the spring with an epi­cen­tre in New York, a sec­ond in the US south and a third in the Midwest. In to­tal, the coun­try has recorded 10.7 mil­lion cases and more than 247,000 deaths.</p>

The num&#xAD;ber of cases in Texas has ex&#xAD;ceeded one mil&#xAD;lion.</p>
