    <p>The let­ter “Dis­tance-based road charg­ing is eq­ui­table” (Sept 18) is overly sim­plis­tic and does not con­sider com­plex­i­ties and known out­comes in trans­port eq­uity, a topic long stud­ied by trans­port aca­demics.</p>
    <p>Flat-fare sub­way sys­tems are in fact com­mon, be­ing used in cities like New York, Los An­ge­les and Paris, and the ques­tion of eq­uity has been ex­ten­sively de­bated. Stud­ies on fare eq­uity make a dis­tinc­tion be­tween ver­ti­cal eq­uity – eq­uity be­tween in­di­vid­u­als be­long­ing to dif­fer­ent groups – and hor­i­zon­tal eq­uity – eq­uity among in­di­vid­u­als in the same group.</p>
    <p>A June 2020 re­view of this topic by Mr Isak Rubens­son in the jour­nal Trans­port Pol­icy re­veals that the im­pact on eq­uity de­pends largely on the spa­tial dis­tri­bu­tion of a pop­u­la­tion. In denser Euro­pean style cities where high-in­come res­i­dents live closer to the city cen­tre, a dis­tance-de­pen­dent fare is hor­i­zon­tally eq­ui­table but has poor ver­ti­cal eq­uity. The re­verse has been shown to be true for ver­ti­cal eq­uity in US cities where poorer res­i­dents live in the in­ner city while the more af­flu­ent pop­u­la­tion lives in the sub­urbs.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, we have a hy­brid sys­tem where full fares on pub­lic trans­port are based on a dis­tance charg­ing sys­tem, but flat fares are avail­able through schemes like stu­dent con­ces­sion passes and adult monthly travel cards. These schemes re­duce the trans­port bur­den for res­i­dents liv­ing in the sub­urbs, hence in­creas­ing ver­ti­cal eq­uity.</p>
    <p>A pure dis­tance-based Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem would be hor­i­zon­tally eq­ui­table but de­pend­ing on its de­sign, could have poor ver­ti­cal eq­uity, plac­ing an in­creas­ing bur­den on those liv­ing in the out­ly­ing sub­urbs. While it is true that in the cur­rent sys­tem, mo­torists in the sub­urbs some­times pay more by pass­ing through more ERP gantries, this is very of­ten not the case.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a mo­torist trav­el­ling from Changi to the city via East Coast Park­way cur­rently pays the same as some­one trav­el­ling from Ma­rine Pa­rade. Sim­i­larly, a mo­torist trav­el­ling to the city from Pasir Ris via the Pan-Is­land Ex­press­way pays the same as one trav­el­ling from Be­dok.</p>
    <p>Our cur­rent pub­lic trans­port pric­ing sys­tem does take ver­ti­cal eq­uity se­ri­ously and I do think it is im­por­tant that we con­tinue to con­sider this when de­sign­ing any po­ten­tial fu­ture dis­tance pric­ing sys­tem, es­pe­cially at a time when we are see­ing ris­ing con­cerns about so­cial in­equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
