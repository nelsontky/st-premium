    <p>Per­haps due to the low num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Sin­ga­pore nowa­days, I have ob­served a few cases where the SafeEn­try check-in/out mea­sures were not fol­lowed strictly.</p>
    <p>At a su­per­mar­ket I go to, a staff mem­ber di­rects cus­tomers to the con­tact­less tem­per­a­ture self-check ma­chine. How­ever, he doesn’t even look at the tem­per­a­ture that is dis­played. A cus­tomer with a fever could still walk in un­chal­lenged.</p>
    <p>At a shop­ping mall I visit reg­u­larly, the staff would just wave cus­tomers in af­ter they flash their smart­phone screens to show that they have scanned the Safe-En­try QR code.</p>
    <p>How­ever, can the staff, from where they are sit­ting at their sta­tion a few me­tres from the cus­tomers walk­ing in, re­ally see clearly that the screens ac­tu­ally show the cor­rect lo­ca­tion and time of en­try?</p>
    <p>Oc­ca­sion­ally I have ob­served some mem­bers of the pub­lic call­ing up screen­shots on their phones and then en­ter­ing the place with­out scan­ning the QR code. Per­haps they used the app’s “favourites” fea­ture, or they could have just used a screen­shot of a pre­vi­ous en­try scan. No­body would know be­cause the staff don’t check prop­erly.</p>
    <p>When such Safe-En­try checks started, staff seemed more vig­i­lant. More peo­ple were scan­ning their iden­tity cards and the process was longer, but the checks were largely ef­fec­tively done.</p>
    <p>Per­haps due to the need for speed and con­ve­nience, and per­haps partly due to com­pla­cency, some staff at en­try points do not seem to be do­ing their checks prop­erly, and some mem­bers of the pub­lic seem to be gam­ing the sys­tem too.</p>
    <p>Although Sin­ga­pore is spared the chaos seen in many parts of the world, a pre­ma­ture re­lax­ation of safety mea­sures, of­fi­cially or other­wise, can lead to an es­ca­la­tion in the num­ber of in­fec­tion cases here.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing to the mea­sures may be in­con­ve­nient, but ev­ery­one needs to do his part prop­erly. There is no point do­ing things “just for show”.</p>
