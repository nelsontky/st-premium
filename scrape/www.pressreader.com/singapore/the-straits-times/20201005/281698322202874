    <p>It is Sun­day evening at a pop­u­lar com­mu­nity spot in Hougang, and its street soc­cer and bas­ket­ball courts are a flurry of ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>On the ad­ja­cent foot­ball field, eight-a-side games are tak­ing place with makeshift goal posts, as play­ers wait on the side­lines for their turn.</p>
    <p>Bryan (not his real name) and his team­mates are play­ing five-a-side foot­ball on the court dur­ing a re­cent visit by The Straits Times, and as they cel­e­brate their vic­tory over their op­po­nents with high fives, the next team pre­pares to mount a fresh chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>ST checks re­vealed sim­i­lar scenes in com­mu­nity sports fa­cil­i­ties in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Ba­tok, Bukit Merah, Seran­goon and Tampines.</p>
    <p>While the ac­tiv­i­ties would not have raised any eye­brows on a reg­u­lar week­end, these are un­usual times amid a Covid-19 pan­demic that has seen cities go­ing into lock­down, and sport – both pro­fes­sional and recre­ational – com­ing to a halt world­wide, with more than 35 mil­lion peo­ple in­fected and over a mil­lion deaths.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, while the num­ber of Covid-19 cases has steadily de­creased in the last two weeks of last month, with no more than 31 new daily cases, phase two safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures mean that week­end war­riors have to fol­low strict guide­lines when they go out to play sport.</p>
    <p>FLOUT­ING SAFETY MEA­SURES</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to ST’s queries, the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) said mem­bers of the pub­lic who would like to use these pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties must ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, in­clud­ing keep­ing to groups no larger than five, and not in­ter­min­gling be­tween groups.</p>
    <p>About 3,000 safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and en­force­ment of­fi­cers walk the ground daily “to re­mind mem­bers of the pub­lic to ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures as we take a grad­u­ated ap­proach to re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties”, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Breaches of these mea­sures can re­sult in fines. First-time of­fend­ers face a com­po­si­tion fine of $300 and re­peat of­fend­ers will face higher fines. Egre­gious cases may face pros­e­cu­tion in court, and of­fend­ers can be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed for up to six months.</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­i­ties may also be tem­po­rar­ily closed to pre­vent large groups from gath­er­ing and for a re­view of safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>‘IT WON’T HAP­PEN TO ME’ MEN­TAL­ITY</p>
    <p>ST reached out to all 17 town coun­cils in Sin­ga­pore, and while only two re­sponded, both Bis­han-Toa Payoh and Nee Soon said that they have closed five and two bas­ket­ball courts within their re­spec­tive con­stituen­cies fol­low­ing com­plaints over vi­o­la­tions of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>On Sept 21, Shin Min Daily News re­ported that two bas­ket­ball courts in Yishun Ring Road – cov­ered by Nee Soon Town Coun­cil – had been closed, while ST checks showed the bas­ket­ball court at MacPher­son Com­mu­nity Club was closed “due to mul­ti­ple breaches of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures”.</p>
    <p>But these have not de­terred recre­ational play­ers such as Bryan from con­tin­u­ing to do so at some of the 437 bas­ket­ball, 145 street soc­cer courts (ac­cord­ing to the 2016/17 Na­tional Sport Fa­cil­ity Cen­sus) and other spots across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The 18-year-old stu­dent, who lives in Hougang es­tate, said: “The courts were empty dur­ing phase one, and I also didn’t go out to play ini­tially in phase two. But as I started hear­ing the fa­mil­iar noises at the court, I couldn’t re­sist join­ing them.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally missed the buzz of play­ing foot­ball with my friends, and touch wood, the num­ber of cases seems to be go­ing down, and so far, noth­ing bad has hap­pened from peo­ple play­ing at the courts.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dent Joey Tan, 25, who plays bas­ket­ball in Bukit Merah, said: “Get­ting caught by the au­thor­i­ties is a worry be­cause we have heard of po­lice checks and warn­ings. We don’t think so much about catch­ing Covid be­cause we usu­ally play among the same group of friends. Maybe the Gov­ern­ment can con­sider in­creas­ing the limit be­cause the group of five rule is too re­stric­tive.”</p>
    <p>Some res­i­dents liv­ing near such fa­cil­i­ties are dis­mayed by the “ir­re­spon­si­ble” at­ti­tude and be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Ms Re­becca Tan, a 37-year-old pri­vate tu­tor who lives near MacPher­son Com­mu­nity Club, said the bas­ket­ball court there was al­most al­ways crowded af­ter school hours un­til late evening.</p>
    <p>“It’s pretty ir­re­spon­si­ble of these play­ers to be do­ing so, es­pe­cially when there’s a pan­demic go­ing on,” she added. “I feel be­cause of the great job the Gov­ern­ment has done curb­ing the spread of the virus, many Sin­ga­pore­ans have be­come ar­ro­gant and have an ‘it won’t hap­pen to me’ men­tal­ity. Un­til a vac­cine is found, we just have to be so­cially re­spon­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>VIRUS RE­MAINS SE­RI­OUS THREAT</p>
    <p>An MSE spokesman urged unity as the na­tion con­tin­ues its fight against the coro­n­avirus, say­ing: “Covid-19 re­mains a se­ri­ous threat. Even as the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases has re­mained low in phase two and Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally lifts re­stric­tions, we must re­main vig­i­lant to avoid the resur­gence of cases seen in many other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Our daily ac­tions im­pact our col­lec­tive de­fence against Covid-19. We urge mem­bers of the pub­lic to con­tinue be­ing so­cially re­spon­si­ble by ob­serv­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, such as not gath­er­ing in groups of more than five, and to wear masks out­side their homes at all times, ex­cept when per­form­ing stren­u­ous ac­tiv­i­ties or while eat­ing or drink­ing.”</p>
    <p>He en­cour­aged those who en­counter any breach of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to make a report through the OneSer­vice app, which will help rel­e­vant agen­cies to iden­tify lo­ca­tions for ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient de­ploy­ment of of­fi­cers for en­force­ment and pa­trolling ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
