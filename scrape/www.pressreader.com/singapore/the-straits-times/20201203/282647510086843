    <p>K-drama Tale Of The Nine Tailed is an epic love story of a pro­ducer fall­ing for a su­per­nat­u­ral be­ing. Here are five things to know about it</p>
    <p>El­e­ments of South Korean mythol­ogy about the nine-tailed fox, or gu­miho, and un­ex­pected im­pro­vi­sa­tions make their way into fan­tasy ro­mance K-drama Tale Of The Nine Tailed.</p>
    <p>The cast in­cludes Lee Dong­wook, Jo Bo-ah and Kim Bum. They tell The Straits Times over e-mail five things to know about the series, which is now stream­ing on Viu.</p>
    <p>1 AN EPIC RO­MANCE</p>
    <p>Tale Of The Nine Tailed fol­lows the ro­mance of a su­per­nat­u­ral be­ing – a gu­miho named Lee Yeon, played by Lee – and the pro­ducer of a su­per­nat­u­ral tele­vi­sion pro­gramme, Nam Ji-ah, played by Jo. Ji-ah also has a tragic ro­mance with Lee Yeon in her pre­vi­ous life.</p>
    <p>Jo (For­est, 2020), 29, says: “My favourite scene from this drama is when Ah-eum, Ji-ah’s char­ac­ter from her pre­vi­ous life, gave up her life for Lee Yeon. It had some ac­tion com­po­nents but was also very emo­tional, which made me ner­vous be­cause that scene threads to­gether the sad nar­ra­tive of Lee Yeon and Ah-eum and plays an im­por­tant role in the story.”</p>
    <p>Lee (Touch Your Heart, 2019), 39, says Jo was easy to work with to create a ro­mance of epic pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>“She is a lovely and adorable per­son in real life. She has an open heart and is also very un­der­stand­ing, so it was easy to dis­cuss de­tails about our char­ac­ters and per­for­mance with her.”</p>
    <p>2 A LOVE-HATE BRO­MANCE</p>
    <p>Kim (Boys Over Flow­ers, 2009), plays Lee’s charm­ing yet sly half­brother Lee Rang, who is parthu­man, in the series. The two have a com­pli­cated bro­mance, bounc­ing from lov­ing brothers to sib­ling ri­valry and back.</p>
    <p>This is the first drama for Kim, 31, since his dis­charge from the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>He re­calls: “In a scene set in the for­est, the part where Lee Yeon pats Lee Rang on the head was ac­tu­ally an im­pro­vi­sa­tion by Lee Dong­wook. The lit­tle de­tails that he pays at­ten­tion to re­ally left me amazed.”</p>
    <p>3 CHAL­LENG­ING THE FE­MALE LEAD</p>
    <p>While Jo’s main char­ac­ter is Ji-ah, she also played the pre­vi­ous in­car­na­tion of Ji-ah, Ah-eum. And the vil­lain of the series, Imoogi – a beast who has the power to read minds – at­taches it­self to Ah-eum and Ji-ah at dif­fer­ent points in the story.</p>
    <p>Jo had to com­pletely trans­form the way she acted when the evil Imoogi was in the body of her char­ac­ters. She says: “We can prob­a­bly think of it as me hav­ing to take on four dif­fer­ent roles in this drama. This is my first time hav­ing to take on these many roles in one pro­duc­tion and I was pretty ner­vous about film­ing.”</p>
    <p>4 EL­E­MENTS OF A THRILLER</p>
    <p>Jo is i nter­ested i n the thriller genre, which the series also in­cor­po­rates el­e­ments of.</p>
    <p>She says: “That’s what at­tracted me to this script. I hope I can do a dif­fer­ent type of thriller in the fu­ture and I also want to try ro­man­tic come­dies and melo­dra­mas.”</p>
    <p>5 CRE­AT­ING A FAN­TASY WORLD</p>
    <p>Build­ing a fan­tasy world was part of the series’ ap­peal for its cast.</p>
    <p>“The con­cept of us­ing a tra­di­tional Korean le­gend as the back­ground and premise for a drama is some­thing fresh for me,” says Kim.</p>
    <p>Lee, who played a grim reaper in the 2016 hit Goblin, says fan­tasy series are not easy to make.</p>
    <p>“Fan­tasy pro­duc­tions re­quire us to use our imag­i­na­tion to bring fic­tional worlds and sto­ries that do not ac­tu­ally ex­ist alive on screen. That is the most dif­fi­cult thing.”</p>
