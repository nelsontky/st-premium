    <p>TI­MOTHY HO, 28</p>
    <p>THE ORI­EN­TAL­IST HOUSE www.the­o­ri­en­tal­ist­house.com</p>
    <p>His Per­anakan mother bought him a toy cook­ing set when he was lit­tle, and chef Ti­mothy Ho thinks that might be when he got in­ter­ested in cook­ing.</p>
    <p>“My mother was al­ways in the kitchen and she would cook laksa, ayam buah keluak, babi pongteh and ev­ery other Sun­day, there would be popiah,” he says.</p>
    <p>Some of those flavours might end up on the menu at The Ori­en­tal­ist House in Gey­lang, a tast­ing room for the Sin­ga­pore spir­its com­pany founded by en­tre­pre­neur Michel Lu.</p>
    <p>There, Ho cooks din­ner for five, a six-course meal priced at $138.</p>
    <p>While the chef has not worked much in Sin­ga­pore and is un­known here, he has paid his dues. He is a grad­u­ate of Te­masek Polytech­nic’s culi­nary and cater­ing man­age­ment pro­gramme, and went on to the Culi­nary In­sti­tute of Amer­ica here.</p>
    <p>For his work ex­pe­ri­ence, he de­cided to head to Seat­tle, while his school mates were off to other Amer­i­can cities such as New York.</p>
    <p>“I was in­trigued by the Port­land and Seat­tle ar­eas. They’re low key, but all the tech com­pa­nies are based there, and tech peo­ple need to eat.”</p>
    <p>So he wrote in to Can­lis, a fam­i­lyrun, fine-din­ing restau­rant, fig­ur­ing, prag­mat­i­cally, that he needed to level up on tech­ni­cal skill first.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to up­grade from ca­sual to fine-din­ing.”</p>
    <p>He ended up work­ing there for four years, cy­cling through the dif­fer­ent sta­tions in the kitchen – hot food, grill, cold food, prep kitchen, pri­vate din­ing and pas­try.</p>
    <p>Then Covid-19 erupted, his con­tract ended, and he came back.</p>
    <p>How is he go­ing to im­press din­ers when his kitchen is in good food cen­tral? Crab bee­hoon in­sti­tu­tion Sin Huat is across the street, ace zi char restau­rant Sik Bao Sin a stone’s throw away.</p>
    <p>Plus, there are other de­lights: frog por­ridge, clay­pot rice and Hokkien mee nearby.</p>
    <p>“Num­ber 1, it’s not go­ing to be lo­cal dishes,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that some­one who has been do­ing it for 50 years has it keyed in.”</p>
    <p>So he plans to in­cor­po­rate Sin­ga­pore flavours into dishes cooked us­ing West­ern tech­niques – he is not the first to do that, of course.</p>
    <p>And he plans to tap into his Per­anakan roots for desserts too, us­ing in­gre­di­ents such as sugee and pan­dan.</p>
    <p>There might also frozen foie gras flavoured with five-spice pow­der grated over kaya toast, which sounds sim­i­lar to a dish Amer­i­can chef Craig Schantz cre­ated some years ago for Tan­jong Beach Club on Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>One dessert this writer tasted was not per­fect but showed prom­ise.</p>
    <p>A del­i­cate disk of pan­dan cake oozes salty gula melaka when cut, re­call­ing the best part of eat­ing an on­deh on­deh.</p>
    <p>The green sable Bre­ton atop the cake could have been more crisp but it is dif­fi­cult not to want to snap a photo of the pret­tily piped co­conut cre­meux.</p>
    <p>This young chef has no short­age of ideas. Can he put them all into a co­he­sive, multi-course meal?</p>
    <p>He is start­ing with a small au­di­ence, just five din­ers a night from Wed­nes­days to Satur­days.</p>
    <p>Every­one has to start some­where.</p>
