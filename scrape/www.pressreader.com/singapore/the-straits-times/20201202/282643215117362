    <p>When Ms Canda came across Kali Ma­japahit, a South-east Asian mar­tial arts school in Sin­ga­pore, she was “ec­static”.</p>
    <p>Kali is one of the terms used to re­fer to the tra­di­tional mar­tial arts in the Philip­pines, her home coun­try. “I had wanted to learn this art as it is part of my cul­ture,” she said.</p>
    <p>The school, which has branches in Clarke Quay and Up­per Seran­goon, im­parts knowl­edge and skills through a com­bi­na­tion of var­i­ous mar­tial arts such as kali, silat, muay thai, kung fu and box­ing, and even in­cludes park­our.</p>
    <p>In 2012, she be­gan her jour­ney in learn­ing kali – which em­pha­sises fight­ing with sticks, bladed weapons and var­i­ous im­pro­vised weapons, as well as “open-hand” tech­niques with­out weapons.</p>
    <p>She en­joyed it so much that she quit her job as a se­nior in­te­rior de­signer in 2018 and joined the school as a full-time mar­tial arts in­struc­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Canda, who has been in Sin­ga­pore for 18 years, said: “I like in­te­rior de­sign­ing, but it came to a point where I felt stressed and found no pur­pose in what I did. I be­came pas­sion­ate about be­ing a part of a com­mu­nity that helps oth­ers to be­come the best ver­sion of them­selves through mar­tial arts.”</p>
    <p>Now, Ms Canda, who has a se­cond-de­gree black belt, teaches mar­tial arts to chil­dren and adults.</p>
    <p>“I do not see it as a job. It is what I be­lieve in and it has been re­ward­ing to see chil­dren un­lock their po­ten­tial and reach their goals with con­fi­dence,” she said.</p>
