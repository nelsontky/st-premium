    <p>SEOUL • Serve the army or go to jail.</p>
    <p>I’m not talk­ing about Singapore’s com­pul­sory na­tional ser­vice (NS), but South Korea’s.</p>
    <p>By law, all able-bod­ied men in South Korea must en­list in the army be­tween ages 18 and 28 for about two years.</p>
    <p>It is a rite of pas­sage for young men, as more than 200,000 of them join the mil­i­tary ev­ery year to learn how to de­fend the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Yet a small num­ber are caught for il­le­gal ex­emp­tions or fail to en­list when nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Draft dodg­ing in South Korea is a highly con­tentious is­sue that can trig­ger a public out­cry, es­pe­cially if the cul­prit is a chae­bol (Korean for con­glom­er­ate) scion, a politi­cian’s son or a K-pop star.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Mil­i­tary Man­power Ad­min­is­tra­tion re­vealed the per­sonal in­for­ma­tion of 256 guys who failed to en­list when they should. The list in­cludes France-based foot­baller Suk Hyun-jun, 29.</p>
    <p>If caught, draft dodgers face up to three years in jail as pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the num­ber of people caught for il­le­gal NS ex­emp­tions in­creased from 47 in 2015 to 75 in 2019, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>To get out of it, dodgers would in­ten­tion­ally gain or lose huge amounts of weight, fake men­tal dis­or­ders or get full body tat­toos, which are not al­lowed in the army.</p>
    <p>Some were so pet­ri­fied about en­list­ing that they cut off their fin­gers or toes to claim dis­abil­ity, while oth­ers dam­aged their hear­ing tem­po­rar­ily by ex­pos­ing them­selves to loud noises, so as to get a med­i­cal cer­tifi­cate to qual­ify for NS ex­emp­tion.</p>
    <p>NS: TOUGH­EST TIME OF ONE’S LIFE</p>
    <p>NS is con­sid­ered the tough­est time of a South Korean man’s life, as re­cruits are sub­ject to all kinds of ex­treme train­ing in prepa­ra­tion for the worst-case sce­nario – war with nu­clear-armed North Korea, painfully cap­tured in the 2004 award-win­ning film Taegukgi, or Broth­er­hood, about two broth­ers forcibly con­scripted to fight in the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, trainees have to go into a gas-filled room to train for a chem­i­cal at­tack – a suf­fo­cat­ing, chaotic ex­pe­ri­ence that “hurts like hell”, ac­cord­ing to one de­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>Win­ter drills are also tough. Imag­ine walk­ing up to 40km a day car­ry­ing guns and 20kg bags in tem­per­a­tures as low as mi­nus 25 deg C.</p>
    <p>And then there’s the ex­ten­sive abuse by higher-rank­ing of­fi­cers that can drive some re­cruits to sui­cide.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, some young South Korean men do not want to en­list when they are pur­su­ing big dreams in the prime of their youth.</p>
    <p>Ex­emp­tions are granted only to ex­cep­tional tal­ents who bring glory to the coun­try, such as Olympic-win­ning ath­letes and award-win­ning clas­si­cal mu­si­cians.</p>
    <p>K-pop stars, how­ever, are al­lowed to seek de­fer­ments only un­til the age of 30.</p>
    <p>CELEBRITY DRAFT DODGERS</p>
    <p>A num­ber of South Korean celebri­ties have tried to evade NS in the past, caus­ing a huge up­roar.</p>
    <p>Hip-hop singer MC Mong was found to have in­ten­tion­ally ex­tracted more than nine teeth in 2007 to es­cape NS, while pop­u­lar ac­tor Song Se­ung-heon spiked a urine test in 2004 to make it seem he was un­fit for the army.</p>
    <p>Singer Kim Woo-joo, mean­while, was sen­tenced to a year in jail in 2015 for fak­ing a men­tal ill­ness to avoid serv­ing NS.</p>
    <p>And then there’s Korean-Amer­i­can singer Steve</p>
    <p>Yoo, whose ca­reer tanked at the age of 26 af­ter he was ac­cused of re­nounc­ing his South Korean cit­i­zen­ship in 2002 to evade con­scrip­tion. As he had re­peat­edly promised to ful­fil his mil­i­tary duty, he was deemed to have be­trayed the coun­try, and the Min­istry of Jus­tice im­posed an 18-year en­try ban on him.</p>
    <p>Now 44, Yoo is fight­ing to re­turn to Seoul, but the govern­ment re­fuses to grant him a travel visa, in­sist­ing that his re­turn could hurt na­tional in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>It has been 18 years but the wound re­mains raw.</p>
    <p>Just last month, a law­maker pro­posed a Bill to “pre­vent the next Steve Yoo” by ban­ning en­try to people who give up their Korean cit­i­zen­ship be­fore serv­ing NS.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause ac­quir­ing for­eign cit­i­zen­ship is deemed the most “ef­fec­tive” – and least pain­ful – way to dodge NS.</p>
    <p>Sta­tis­tics show that more than 40,000 people were ex­empted from NS in the past decade as they had given up their South Korean cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Among them, about 80 people re­gained their cit­i­zen­ship sta­tus af­ter turn­ing 38 – af­ter which they are not li­able for NS any more.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians and wealthy people are known to send their sons over­seas – mostly to Amer­ica – so they can ac­quire for­eign cit­i­zen­ship and evade NS.</p>
    <p>QUANDARY FOR DUAL CIT­I­ZENS</p>
    <p>Those who are dual cit­i­zens from birth, es­pe­cially if both their coun­tries re­quire them to en­list, face the tough choice of which army to serve.</p>
    <p>This is the case for mar­i­tal unions be­tween South Kore­ans and Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The Singapore Govern­ment al­lows Sin­ga­porean males to re­nounce cit­i­zen­ship only at the age of 21 – af­ter com­plet­ing manda­tory NS from age 18.</p>
    <p>From the age of 13, all NS-li­able males who live over­seas for two years or more must ob­tain an exit per­mit and pay a hefty bond of at least $75,000 to the Govern­ment as guar­an­tee that they will re­turn at 18 to serve the na­tion.</p>
    <p>De­fault­ing NS comes at a huge price – a fine not ex­ceed­ing $10,000, up to three years’ jail, or both.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen NS de­fault­ers have been caught and jailed since 2017 and a num­ber of them are dual cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>South Korea is no less le­nient, so you are ba­si­cally stuck be­tween a rock and a hard place.</p>
    <p>When I checked, Singapore’s Min­istry of De­fence re­it­er­ated that the En­list­ment Act ap­plies to all Singapore cit­i­zens re­gard­less of whether they have for­eign cit­i­zen­ship as well.</p>
    <p>“It recog­nises that all male cit­i­zens must per­form their na­tional ser­vice du­ties to de­fend Singapore as they en­joy priv­i­leges and ben­e­fits as cit­i­zens,” said Min­def. “Their obli­ga­tions from other cit­i­zen­ships they have cho­sen can­not ex­empt them from the obli­ga­tions and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties as a Sin­ga­porean.”</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore­ans who have made their homes in South Korea and can­not af­ford the bond, the choice is a hard one.</p>
    <p>In the worst-case sce­nario, you could end up serv­ing NS twice – first in Singapore at age 18, then in South Korea af­ter 21.</p>
    <p>A friend feels that the only way out for her teenage son, who has de­cided to re­main a South Korean cit­i­zen, is to never step into Singapore again – like Singapore-born, US-based au­thor Kevin Kwan of Crazy Rich Asians fame, who is wanted for de­fault­ing on his NS obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Another friend, who has two young boys, plans to re­nounce their South Korean cit­i­zen­ship and move back to Singapore as she can­not af­ford to pro­vide two sep­a­rate bonds of $75,000.</p>
    <p>“That’s like half the price of an HDB flat, so I might as well get the flat in­stead of pay­ing the bond,” she said. How­ever, she fears be­ing sep­a­rated from her South Korean hus­band if he is un­able to find a job in Singapore and wants to con­tinue work­ing.</p>
    <p>Yet another friend is wor­ried her seven-year-old son – the only male de­scen­dant in three gen­er­a­tions – would lose his Korean iden­tity if he were to re­nounce his South</p>
    <p>Korean cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>I can un­der­stand their con­cerns, as I, too, am a par­ent of a half-Korean, half-Sin­ga­porean child, just that she is a girl.</p>
    <p>All of us wanted the best of both worlds for our chil­dren when we opted for dual cit­i­zen­ship, but there seems no so­lu­tion in sight to the NS quandary for now.</p>
