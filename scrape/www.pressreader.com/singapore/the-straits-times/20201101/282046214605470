    <p>Sin­ga­pore has topped an in­dex of pub­lic per­cep­tions of law and or­der for at least the sixth year in a row.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic tied with Turk­menistan for the top rank in the Gallup 2020 Global Law and Or­der Re­port re­leased last week.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries scored 97 out of a pos­si­ble 100, higher than the world av­er­age of 82.</p>
    <p>The higher the score, the higher the pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion that re­ported feel­ing safe.</p>
    <p>China, which has a score of 94, was next on the list, fol­lowed by Ice­land and Kuwait, which both scored 93.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria, Nor­way, Switzer­land, United Arab Emi­rates and Uzbek­istan were also in the top 10, with a score of 92.</p>
    <p>The re­sults were based on faceto-face or tele­phone in­ter­views con­ducted by Gallup with nearly 175,000 peo­ple aged 15 or older, in 144 coun­tries and ar­eas last year, be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, 1,040 peo­ple were polled from July to Novem­ber last year. This was done face to face in English and Chi­nese, ac­cord­ing to Gallup data.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey asked four ques­tions</p>
    <p>to gauge peo­ple’s sense of se­cu­rity and ex­pe­ri­ence with crime and law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents were asked if they had con­fi­dence in the lo­cal po­lice force in the area where they lived</p>
    <p>and if they felt safe walk­ing alone at night.</p>
    <p>They were also asked if they had money or prop­erty stolen from them or some­one liv­ing with them in the last 12 months, or if</p>
    <p>they had been as­saulted or mugged in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has topped the in­dex since at least 2015.</p>
    <p>Its score of 97 has re­mained the same since the 2017 re­port.</p>
    <p>Gallup said 97 per cent of Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents felt safe walk­ing alone at night, while glob­ally, nearly seven in 10 (69 per cent) said last year that they felt that way where they lived and had con­fi­dence in their lo­cal po­lice (69 per cent).</p>
    <p>About one in eight (12 per cent) glob­ally said that they had prop­erty stolen from them or an­other house­hold mem­ber in the past year, and 6 per cent said they were as­saulted or mugged.</p>
    <p>War-torn Afghanista­n ranked the low­est for a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive year, with a score of 43.</p>
    <p>Just 12 per cent of Afghans last year said they felt safe walk­ing alone in their area at night.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s score dropped to 76, down from 91 in 2018, the last year it was in­cluded in the in­dex.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed wide­spread protests against the gov­ern­ment sparked by a now-with­drawn ex­tra­di­tion Bill.</p>
