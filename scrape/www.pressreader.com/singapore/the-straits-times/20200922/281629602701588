    <p>Lo­cal com­pa­nies in sec­tors from food and fash­ion to beauty and home decor will soon find it eas­ier to make an im­pact on in­ter­na­tional mar­kets.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore brand mark to be in­tro­duced in Novem­ber aims to pro­vide as­sur­ances to over­seas buy­ers of a prod­uct’s qual­ity, and in turn help it stand out from the com­pe­ti­tion and com­mand pre­mium pric­ing.</p>
    <p>The roll-out will start with prod­ucts re­lated to food and bev­er­age (F&B), beauty and well­ness, fash­ion and ac­ces­sories, as well as home­ware and decor, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan told a vir­tual brief­ing that the fo­cus on qual­ity will be a key dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion for Sin­ga­pore food prod­ucts from its com­peti­tors, with a grow­ing con­sumer fo­cus on food safety and qual­ity as­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>“We will fur­ther am­plify this to make sure that con­sumer in­ter­ests and the pur­chase of lo­cal brands will be en­hanced, not just in the Sin­ga­pore market but also in the over­seas market,” he noted.</p>
    <p>A road map for the brand mark and plans for var­i­ous sec­tors will be re­leased in due course, he added.</p>
    <p>“We see our­selves be­ing able to value-add... at crit­i­cal parts of the global value chain, and that will al­low us (to) not only have an ex­pand­ing market, but it will also strengthen our own do­mes­tic food re­silience,” noted Mr Chan, who was speak­ing af­ter a visit to lo­cal food man­u­fac­turer KH Roberts.</p>
    <p>He noted that the food man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vice in­dus­try is expected to be a key pil­lar among growth sec­tors in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The food ser­vice seg­ment con­sists of more than 10,000 firms, which ac­count for around 0.8 per cent of an­nual gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) and over 180,000 jobs.</p>
    <p>There are around 940 en­ter­prises in food man­u­fac­tur­ing, con­tribut­ing 1.1 per cent to an­nual GDP and em­ploy­ing over 48,000 work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted that this seg­ment had ex­panded con­sis­tently be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, record­ing a com­pounded an­nual growth rate of about 6.45 per cent be­tween 2013 and 2018.</p>
    <p>While the sec­tor has seen its fair share of chal­lenges amid the pan­demic, in­clud­ing sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions, its growth tra­jec­tory has not been dis­rupted, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan pointed to Asia’s ex­pand­ing mid­dle-class market, and noted that qual­ity prod­ucts are a key con­cern for such con­sumers.</p>
    <p>This will play to Sin­ga­pore’s strengths and cre­ate job op­por­tu­ni­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>One is in the area of re­search and devel­op­ment such as the push here for agri-tech devel­op­ment, an ini­tia­tive that is forg­ing col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing and com­pa­nies here.</p>
    <p>He cited KH Roberts, which set up an in­dus­trial lab with the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy last year that al­lows stu­dents ac­cess to equip­ment and the com­pany’s tech­ni­cians and sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>One of the in­stru­ments stu­dents can ac­cess is an ex­truder, which trans­forms pro­teins into meat-like sub­stances or plant-based prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>KH Roberts chief ex­ec­u­tive Peter Ong told the brief­ing: “We are for­tu­nate to be able to host that equip­ment here for the stu­dents to have (prac­ti­cal) ex­pe­ri­ence, and also for us to work on in­dus­try-type projects for po­ten­tial cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>Prima Taste gen­eral man­ager</p>
    <p>Eric Sim said: “The global food sec­tor is highly com­pet­i­tive, es­pe­cially in the ready-to-eat and ready-to­cook market, with many brands fight­ing for the same con­sumer dol­lar in each re­spec­tive market.”</p>
    <p>The in­tro­duc­tion of a brand mark will al­low com­pa­nies to lever­age Sin­ga­pore’s global rep­u­ta­tion as an in­no­va­tion hub and gain an edge over its com­peti­tors, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Khim Wee, head of busi­ness devel­op­ment at steamed bun maker Lim Kee Food Man­u­fac­tur­ing, said the new brand mark will help es­tab­lish part­ner­ships with ex­port mar­kets and firms over­seas.</p>
    <p>The com­pany ex­ports its prod­ucts to coun­tries such as China, Thai­land and Britain.</p>
    <p>“The mark gives as­sur­ance to part­ners and clients of the qual­ity of our prod­uct, and it is im­por­tant for us to build that con­fi­dence with our B2B (busi­ness-to-busi­ness) part­ners,” Mr Ang said.</p>
