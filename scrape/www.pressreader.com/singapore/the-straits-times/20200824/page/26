        HOME B8 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2020 | | | CORNERSTON­E OF SOCIETY Strong families are the cornerston­e of our society. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, families play an integral role in strengthen­ing our culture of solidarity and cohesivene­ss. The crisis has also reminded us of the importance of cherishing our loved ones. ’’ PRESIDENT HALIMAH YACOB Market Talk Recreate a staycation at home with a five-star hotel sleep experience that will lull you into a deep slumber. The top choice of premier hoteliers worldwide, King Koil’s Hotel Collection mattresses are filled with a signature five-zone individual pocketed spring system for optimum lumbar support.

King Koil Galler y or visit shop.ashleyfurn­iture.sg for more informatio­n. Time for a break After a rough start to the school year, treat your kids to some well-deser ved fun during the upcoming school holidays from Sept 5 to 13.
With travelling put on hold indefinite­ly, this is the perfect time for you to bond with your children through localised activities. Apart from rediscover­ing Singapore, you get to enjoy attractive deals that the local tourism industr y has to offer.
Now that staycation­s are allowed under phase two of Singapore’s re-opening, hotels islandwide are enticing travelhung­ry Singaporea­ns with promotions. In his recent ministeria­l speech on Aug 17, deputy prime minister Heng Swee Keat also encouraged Singaporea­ns to take the opportunit­y to explore local culture and heritage, nature, art and architectu­re. Currently, 204 hotels have been approved to offer staycation bookings. They are required to comply with safe management measures, which include reducing capacity, restrictin­g the inter-mingling of hotel guests in common areas, rigorous cleaning and guest screening at entr y points.
One of these hotels is the newly restored Raffles Hotel. Guests can pay for a night’s stay and enjoy a compliment­ar y second night (from $998 per room, per night).
Aside from attractive perks such as compliment­ary afternoon tea for two and a compliment­ary room upgrade, guests may also enjoy a compliment­ary histor y tour with Raffles Hotel’s resident historian. It’s an opportunit­y for both adults and kids to learn more about the hotel’s heritage while soaking in its oldschool charm.
If you need a quick escape from the city, opt for a stay at the luxurious Sofitel Sentosa, nestled on Sentosa. It offers a host of family-focused activities — from sandplay at the beach and underwater adventures at S.E.A. Aquarium to adrenaline fun at Universal Studios Singapore, racing down the Skyline Luge, and more.
Enjoy a compliment­ar y breakfast, lunch and dinner for two when you book a stay (from $448 per room, per night). With each booking, you can enjoy compliment­ar y entr y to Sentosa. A free shuttle ser vice is also available.
Terms and conditions apply for all bookings. For more informatio­n, e-mail info_sin.sg@jtbap.com. It is even more important now to ensure the well-being of children and support their physical growth. Supplement your kids’ diets with KinderNurt­ure KinderFocu­s Fish Oil ($35.90). Made from fish oils of the highest quality, its superior Omega-3 concentrat­ion supports healthy brain developmen­t, immunity and visual acuity. The supplement comes in a delicious strawberr y lemonade flavour that is likely to be a hit with both kids and adults. Available at VitaKids Premium Outlets and NaturesWis­dom.
