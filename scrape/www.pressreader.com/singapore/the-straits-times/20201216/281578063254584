    <p>The sprawl­ing hill­top site that for­merly housed the Calde­cott Broad­cast Cen­tre in An­drew Road has been sold for $280.9 mil­lion to an en­tity that will be jointly owned by Peren­nial Real Es­tate Hold­ings and its chair­man, Mr Kuok Khoon Hong.</p>
    <p>PRE 10 Pri­vate Lim­ited, the pro­posed en­tity, may “ex­plore de­vel­op­ment op­tions upon com­ple­tion of the trans­ac­tion”, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate con­sul­tants CBRE and Show­suite Con­sul­tancy, which were ap­pointed to mar­ket the site, de­scribed the ten­der ex­er­cise that closed on Dec 9 as a “closely con­tested” one.</p>
    <p>Col­liers In­ter­na­tional (Sin­ga­pore) re­search head Tri­cia Song noted that “with­out spe­cific plans and cost, it is hard to com­ment on the trans­ac­tion value. How­ever, the ap­par­ent de­mand for this large plot of land re­flects con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore landed homes and its prime lo­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>Me­di­a­corp had been granted an out­line ap­proval by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) to re­de­velop the site, lo­cated in the Calde­cott Hill Good Class Bun­ga­low area, into two-storey bun­ga­lows with a min­i­mum land area of 800 sq m per house.</p>
    <p>The site, cur­rently zoned for civic and com­mu­nity in­sti­tu­tion use un­der the URA’s Master Plan 2019, will have to be re­zoned to res­i­den­tial use, which will en­tail pay­ment of a dif­fer­en­tial pre­mium to the state.</p>
    <p>The 752,015 sq ft lease­hold site has a bal­ance lease term of 73 years, which means the de­vel­oper would also need to pay a lease up­grad­ing pre­mium to the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity for the lease to be ex­tended to a fresh 99-year ten­ure.</p>
    <p>Peren­nial Real Es­tate’s spokesman said yes­ter­day: “We are ex­cited to have this rare op­por­tu­nity to own a vast piece of prime land, and will ex­plore de­vel­op­ment op­tions most be­fit­ting of the precinct it is strate­gi­cally lo­cated in.”</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Tay, head of cap­i­tal mar­kets, Sin­ga­pore at CBRE, said: “This is the largest pri­vate re­de­vel­op­ment site sold in 2020, and this is tes­ta­ment to de­vel­op­ers’ con­fi­dence in the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket. We un­der­stand that the pur­chaser will be work­ing with rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties to re­view re­de­vel­op­ment op­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Karamjit Singh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Show­suite Con­sul­tancy, added: “The ten­der ex­er­cise at­tracted mul­ti­ple com­pet­i­tive bids, with the un­der-bid­ders fall­ing close to the win­ning sub­mis­sion. It is a rare op­por­tu­nity to ac­quire a mas­sive plot of el­e­vated land for re­de­vel­op­ment. The en­tire es­tate would stand to ben­e­fit from the even­tual har­mon­i­sa­tion of the plot with it.”</p>
    <p>The site had served as a broad­cast hub for more than six decades un­til 2015, when Me­di­a­corp re­lo­cated to Me­di­apo­lis at one-north in Buona Vista.</p>
