    <p>The Walt Dis­ney Com­pany is piv­ot­ing to a “direct-to-con­sumer first” busi­ness model, which means putting new and ex­ist­ing con­tent on stream­ing plat­forms such as Dis­ney+, and in­creas­ingly by­pass­ing cin­e­mas and tra­di­tional tele­vi­sion chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The me­dia be­he­moth an­nounced that Dis­ney+ will launch in Sin­ga­pore on Feb 23 next year, with more than 500 films and 15,000 episodes of con­tent ac­ces­si­ble for a sub­scrip­tion fee of $11.98 a month or $119.98 a year.</p>
    <p>It re­vealed that Dis­ney+, which launched a year ago, now has 86.6 mil­lion sub­scribers glob­ally. In com­par­i­son, Net­flix – cur­rently the No. 1 on-de­mand stream­ing ser­vice world­wide – has 195 mil­lion sub­scribers.</p>
    <p>In a pre­sen­ta­tion for in­vestors and fans beamed from its Los An­ge­les pro­duc­tion lot on Thurs­day (Los An­ge­les time) – and as the com­pany’s stock price hit an all-time high – the com­pany un­veiled dozens of up­com­ing films and se­ries from Dis­ney and other brands within its sta­ble, in­clud­ing Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and Na­tional Geo­graphic.</p>
    <p>Many are spin-offs and re­boots of ti­tles in Dis­ney’s vast li­brary, but with an em­pha­sis on “qual­ity, not vol­ume”, said chair­man Bob Iger.</p>
    <p>Over the next few years, the com­pany will re­lease – as “Dis­ney+ Orig­i­nals” – roughly 10 Marvel se­ries, 10 Star Wars se­ries, and 30 live-ac­tion and an­i­mated se­ries and fea­tures. All will be new and re­leased di­rectly on Dis­ney+.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese, such as an­i­mated Pixar movie Soul, were ini­tially slated for a the­atri­cal re­lease, but will now de­but ex­clu­sively on Dis­ney+ in the United States this Christ­mas. The film opens in Sin­ga­pore cin­e­mas on Dec 25.</p>
    <p>But Dis­ney chief ex­ec­u­tive Bob Chapek stopped short of repli­cat­ing ri­val Warn­erMe­dia’s rad­i­cal an­nounce­ment that it will re­lease all 2021 Warner Bros films in cin­e­mas and on its HBO Max stream­ing ser­vice si­mul­ta­ne­ously – a move some ob­servers be­lieve sounds a death knell for the the­atri­cal moviego­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Mr Chapek said the com­pany will be flex­i­ble about when and on which plat­form it would de­liver and de­but con­tent, given chang­ing con­sumer pref­er­ences and the “pro­longed un­cer­tainty due to the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of where it orig­i­nates, how­ever, all con­tent will even­tu­ally end up on Dis­ney+ and other direct-to-con­sumer plat­forms the com­pany owns, in­clud­ing ser­vices such as Hulu and ESPN+ in the US.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is pri­ori­tis­ing and ramping up the pro­duc­tion of orig­i­nal con­tent for th­ese plat­forms and will add some­thing new to Dis­ney+ ev­ery week, be it a Dis­ney+ Orig­i­nal, a pre­vi­ous the­atri­cal re­lease or some­thing from its li­brary.</p>
    <p>In the light of con­tin­ued Covid-19-re­lated chal­lenges in the mar­ket­place, tent-pole films such as the an­i­mated Raya And The Last Dragon – in­spired by South-east</p>
    <p>Asian cul­ture and voiced by ac­tresses Kelly Marie Tran and Awk­wa­fina – will be re­leased on Dis­ney+, for a pre­mium, at the same time it de­buts in the­atres next March.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney+ of­fer­ings will also vary some­what in dif­fer­ent coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, there will be con­tent un­der six ban­ners: Dis­ney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Na­tional Geo­graphic and Star, the Asian con­tent brand and Dis­ney’s gen­eral en­ter­tain­ment con­tent brand out­side the US.</p>
    <p>No de­tails have been re­leased on how the launch of Dis­ney+ will af­fect Dis­ney ti­tles that are cur­rently ac­ces­si­ble on tra­di­tional TV and ca­ble plat­forms in Sin­ga­pore, such as the Fox, FX and Na­tional Geo­graphic chan­nels on StarHub and Sing­Tel TV.</p>
    <p>View­ers in Sin­ga­pore can sub­scribe to the new ser­vice on the Dis­ney+ web­site or the Dis­ney+ app, and regis­ter at Dis­neyPlus.com to re­ceive up­dates.</p>
