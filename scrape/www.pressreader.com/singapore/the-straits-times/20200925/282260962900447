    <p>The pro­posed list­ing of Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional’s China unit, Yi­hai Kerry Arawana (YKA), is ex­pected to raise 13.9 bil­lion yuan (S$2.8 bil­lion), and Sin­ga­pore’s sov­er­eign wealth fund GIC will be a strate­gic in­vestor.</p>
    <p>Agri-food gi­ant Wil­mar said in a bourse fil­ing yes­ter­day that the amount is based on an is­sue price of 25.7 yuan per YKA share and the num­ber of new shares to be is­sued by YKA.</p>
    <p>The is­sue price was jointly de­ter­mined by China Se­cu­ri­ties, the spon­sor and a joint lead un­der­writer of the pro­posed list­ing, and China In­ter­na­tional Cap­i­tal, the other joint lead un­der­writer, said Wil­mar.</p>
    <p>The is­sue price trans­lates to a price-to-earn­ings mul­ti­ple of 31.12 times, based on YKA’s FY2019 re­cur­ring net profit and en­larged post-ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO) share cap­i­tal. The av­er­age price-to-earn­ings mul­ti­ple of other listed firms in the same in­dus­try as YKA – be­ing the agri­cul­tural and food pro­cess­ing in­dus­try group – for the im­me­di­ate pre­ced­ing month was 41.86 times.</p>
    <p>The is­sue price was de­ter­mined based on in­vestor de­mand and took into con­sid­er­a­tion, among other things, pre­vail­ing mar­ket con­di­tions, the in­dus­try that YKA is en­gaged in, the com­pa­ra­ble val­u­a­tions of other listed com­pa­nies in the same in­dus­try, the YKA group’s fundrais­ing re­quire­ments, and the joint lead un­der­writ­ers’ un­der­writ­ing risk, Wil­mar said.</p>
    <p>It added that 20 strate­gic in­vestors, com­pris­ing state-owned funds, sov­er­eign wealth funds and in­surance com­pa­nies, have been al­lo­cated 30 per cent of the IPO shares which will be sub­ject to a one-year mora­to­rium on trans­fer, be­gin­ning from the first trad­ing date.</p>
    <p>GIC will be al­lot­ted a stake worth 472.5 mil­lion yuan. Be­sides the Sin­ga­pore sov­er­eign wealth fund, other strate­gic in­vestors in­clude Rongze In­vest­ment Com­pany with an al­lot­ment amount of 770.9 mil­lion yuan and Peo­ple’s Daily Me­dia and Ad­ver­tis­ing Com­pany with 397.9 mil­lion yuan.</p>
    <p>While the pro­posed list­ing is planned to take place by mid-Oc­to­ber, it is still sub­ject to pre­vail­ing mar­ket con­di­tions, and there is no cer­tainty that it will pro­ceed, Wil­mar said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany called for a trad­ing halt on Wed­nes­day morn­ing, which it lifted yes­ter­day morn­ing. Wil­mar shares fell 0.5 per cent to $4.36 yes­ter­day.</p>
