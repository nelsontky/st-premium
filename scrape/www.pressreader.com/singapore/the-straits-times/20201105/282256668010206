    <p>As Sin­ga­pore re­vives its out­break-hit economy, sus­tain­abil­ity and the fight against cli­mate change must be a fun­da­men­tal driver in post-Covid-19 re­cov­ery plans, said Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are at a sig­nif­i­cant junc­ture where we have the op­por­tu­nity to put sus­tain­abil­ity at the core of our re­cov­ery plans and poli­cies, and change the way we pro­duce and con­sume,” the min­is­ter added.</p>
    <p>She was de­liv­er­ing her key­note ad­dress at the Sin­ga­pore Di­a­logue on Sus­tain­able World Re­sources, or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore works hard to “build back bet­ter” in the face of an ex­pected eco­nomic con­trac­tion of 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year, Ms Fu out­lined how this can be done in a sus­tain­able and in­clu­sive man­ner. This in­cludes driv­ing cli­mate ac­tion, catalysing in­no­va­tion and per­sist­ing with zero waste goals.</p>
    <p>She cited how Sin­ga­pore sub­mit­ted its en­hanced plan for emis­sions re­duc­tion to the United Na­tions Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change in March, amid bat­tling the out­break.</p>
    <p>The na­tion aims to halve car­bon emis­sions from its peak by 2050, with a view to achiev­ing net-zero emis­sions as soon as vi­able in the sec­ond half of this cen­tury.</p>
    <p>“This is an am­bi­tious as­pi­ra­tion given our con­straints as a small is­land city-state, which limit our abil­ity to de­ploy re­new­able en­ergy at scale,” said Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>On top of that, this green push can sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s re­cov­ery plans by un­lock­ing new eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties and jobs, she added.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Ms Fu said the sus­tain­abil­ity sec­tor was ex­pected to cre­ate 55,000 jobs in the next decade, with 4,000 cre­ated next year. These in­clude skilled roles in the high-tech agri­cul­ture and aqua­cul­ture in­dus­try, and waste man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment will also grow the tal­ent pool by of­fer­ing schol­ar­ships in ar­eas such as cli­mate adap­ta­tion and cli­mate sci­ence.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual di­a­logue yes­ter­day also saw Ms Fu and In­done­sia’s Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Luhut Pand­jai­tan dis­cuss both coun­tries’ sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts and op­por­tu­ni­ties for re­gional co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said re­gional co­op­er­a­tion in sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts can in­clude a com­mon frame­work for sus­tain­able prod­uct developmen­t and tech­no­log­i­cal col­lab­o­ra­tions in ar­eas such as agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“In the ar­eas of agri­cul­ture and farm­ing, we are just start­ing, but there are coun­tries like In­done­sia, Malaysia, Thai­land that are way ahead of Sin­ga­pore. I’m sure there are lots of progress be­ing made on agri­cul­ture (in these coun­tries) that we can ben­e­fit from,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Luhut also in­vited Sin­ga­pore to be a part of In­done­sia’s green ini­tia­tives, such as in man­grove re­search. The archipelag­o plans to re­plant around 670,000ha of man­groves in the next few years.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu noted that South-east Asia has largely been spared fires and haze this year. This is par­tially due to a wet­ter sec­ond half, caused by the La Nina cli­mate phe­nom­e­non bring­ing cooler weather and more rain­fall to the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“While risks of (haze) re­cur­rence re­main, there are op­por­tu­ni­ties to be gained if ac­tion is taken.</p>
    <p>“With cli­mate change, warmer and drier weather can be ex­pected in the years to come. We must con­tinue to en­hance re­gional co­op­er­a­tion to achieve Asean’s vi­sion of a haze-free re­gion,” Ms Fu said.</p>
