    <p>A show-flat for Sin­ga­pore’s first as­sisted-liv­ing pub­lic hous­ing is now open at HDB Hub, a week ahead of sched­ule.</p>
    <p>To be lo­cated in Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 9, the Com­mu­nity Care Apart­ments are tar­geted at those aged 65 and above who wish to live on their own and yet en­joy some care, sup­port and com­mu­nal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, se­niors who vis­ited the show-flat told The Straits Times that they were at­tracted to the new con­cept, which al­lows them to forge close re­la­tion­ships with other peo­ple in their age group.</p>
    <p>Part-time waiter Tan Soon Huat, 67, said the 32 sq m unit is the per­fect size for him and his wife.</p>
    <p>“The size is just nice, not too big and not too small. We’re old al­ready... it’s good to have neigh­bours look­ing out for one another in this com­mu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Each unit comes with grab bars and a wheel­chair-ac­ces­si­ble bath­room with slip-re­sis­tant floor­ing to let res­i­dents move about with ease.</p>
    <p>Flats have an open lay­out and come with a built-in wardrobe, cab­i­nets and a fur­nished kitchen to re­duce ren­o­va­tion time.</p>
    <p>There will be a fur­nished com­mu­nal space on each floor for res­i­dents to min­gle, and a com­mu­nity man­ager on site to fa­cil­i­tate ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­tired me­chanic Roland Ho, 77, who vis­ited the show-flat, said he is con­sid­er­ing ap­ply­ing for a unit with his wife when the pro­ject launches.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho, who now lives in a four­room Hous­ing Board flat, said: “It’s a nice con­cept and the unit looks com­fort­able... Maybe we can be the first to move in.”</p>
    <p>The pilot batch of Com­mu­nity Care Apart­ments will be launched for sale in Fe­bru­ary. There will be about 160 units, which are ex­pected to be com­pleted in 2024.</p>
    <p>The new flat type comes with a manda­tory service pack­age, which in­cludes 24-hour emer­gency mon­i­tor­ing and re­sponse service, ba­sic health checks, sim­ple home fixes and ac­tiv­i­ties in the com­mu­nal spa­ces within the de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>All res­i­dents will have to subscribe and pay for the ba­sic service pack­age, which starts at $22,000 for a 15-year lease.</p>
    <p>Op­tional ser­vices such as laun­dry, meal de­liv­ery and shared care­giv­ing can be added at ex­tra cost.</p>
    <p>Se­niors must be 65 and above to ap­ply for these flats and must choose a lease that will cover the ap­pli­cant and spouse, if any, un­til</p>
    <p>they are at least 95 years old.</p>
    <p>Prices for these flats range from $40,000 for a 15-year lease to $65,000 for a 35-year lease.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the show-flat, the pub­lic can also view a sam­ple of the com­mu­nal space and scaled mod­els of the block and flat at the HDB Hub atrium in Toa Payoh un­til March 31.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors must book an ap­point­ment via HDB In­foWeb.</p>
    <p>Se­nior part­ner re­la­tion­ship and op­er­a­tions man­ager Densy Kum, 55, said she is look­ing for­ward to more of such flats for se­niors in other parts of Sin­ga­pore and will ap­ply for one when she turns 65.</p>
    <p>“It’s good to stay in an old folks’ com­mu­nity... (where) there will be peo­ple to take care of me and I will also have peers of the same age group to min­gle with,” she said.</p>
