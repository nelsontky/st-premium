    <p>Me­di­a­tion, tra­di­tion­ally a face-to­face process, has moved on­line with the spread of Covid-19 in a trend that will con­tinue af­ter the pan­demic, le­gal ex­perts said at an on­line sem­i­nar last night.</p>
    <p>Costs are lower and pro­duc­tiv­ity is higher with re­mote me­di­a­tion, mak­ing it an at­trac­tive op­tion, they told par­tic­i­pants at the sem­i­nar, jointly held by the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre (SIMC) and its Ky­oto-based Ja­panese coun­ter­part JIMC.</p>
    <p>The two cen­tres in­au­gu­rated a Joint Covid-19 Pro­to­col yes­ter­day to give com­pa­nies ac­cess to on­line me­di­a­tion at low rates, in the first such cross-bor­der col­lab­o­ra­tion in the world.</p>
    <p>“Many busi­nesses around the world have been hit very hard by the pan­demic. Dis­putes could in­crease. Par­ties may find it harder to ful­fil their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions due to Covid-19,” said Sin­ga­pore Law Min­is­ter K. Shanmugam.</p>
    <p>SIMC is one of the world’s top me­di­a­tion cen­tres, hav­ing heard, since its launch in 2014, 130 cases with a to­tal worth of over US$3 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion) and an av­er­age set­tle­ment rate of nearly 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>De­spite the two cen­tres’ col­lab­o­ra­tion, Ja­pan is not yet a party to the Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion on Me­di­a­tion, which came into force in Septem­ber. Pre­vi­ously, there was no ef­fec­tive means to en­force cross-bor­der me­di­ated set­tle­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Shanmugam, who is also Sin­ga­pore’s Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter, urged Ja­pan to join the United Na­tions treaty, which has al­ready been signed by 53 coun­tries, such as China, In­dia and South Korea, and rat­i­fied by six.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese at­tor­ney Yoshi­masa Fu­ruta of An­der­son Mori & To­mot­sune noted that Ja­pan has been re­vis­ing do­mes­tic laws to be­come more open to for­eign me­di­a­tion, and to ad­here to the norms un­der the Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion on Me­di­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He said he ex­pects leg­is­la­tion to be passed by the Diet by next year, at the ear­li­est, with the sign­ing of the con­ven­tion to come af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>JIMC-Ky­oto deputy chief di­rec­tor Naoshi Taka­sugi noted the draw­backs of the on­line process, such as fears over con­fi­den­tial­ity, and the dif­fi­culty of build­ing rap­port or read­ing non-ver­bal cues. But he added that these can be over­come through tech­nol­ogy and ad­e­quate pre-me­di­a­tion prepa­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>SIMC chair­man Ge­orge Lim urged par­ties in dis­putes to look at me­di­a­tion as a gen­er­ally more com­pas­sion­ate op­tion than lit­i­ga­tion dur­ing these dif­fi­cult times.</p>
    <p>He said: “Busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als have suf­fered and will suf­fer. Dis­putes will arise not di­rectly due to the fault of ei­ther party, but be­cause of the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>SIMC chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Chuan Wee Meng added that he fore­sees a “hy­brid” form of in­ter­na­tional me­di­a­tion even when travel re­sumes, as on­line me­di­a­tion can be ar­ranged more quickly with­out the need for travel.</p>
    <p>“This al­lows par­ties to have more prepa­ra­tion be­fore the ac­tual me­di­a­tion, so that when they ac­tu­ally meet face to face, they are more pre­pared and will have a higher chance of suc­cess.”</p>
