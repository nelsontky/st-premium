    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s reach in global ar­bi­tra­tion is also seen in thought lead­er­ship and in its court cases cited abroad over the years.</p>
    <p>The lat­est two in­stances emerged last week, the first be­ing when Sin­ga­pore’s Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon was in­vited to de­liver the Char­tered In­sti­tute of Ar­bi­tra­tors Aus­tralia An­nual Lec­ture 2020.</p>
    <p>The speech was de­liv­ered last Tues­day at a we­bi­nar in­stead of in Syd­ney, given the con­straints of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice ad­dressed a grow­ing con­cern in in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion. He drew no­tice to the per­ceived re­luc­tance by ar­bi­tra­tion tri­bunals to act de­ci­sively in cer­tain sit­u­a­tions, out of fear of their de­ci­sion be­ing chal­lenged by a party claim­ing it did not have the chance to present its case fully.</p>
    <p>“Today, there is a groundswel­l of opin­ion in the ar­bi­tra­tion com­mu­nity that due process para­noia poses a ‘real threat’ to in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion. The con­se­quences are as se­ri­ous as they are pre­dictable,” he said.</p>
    <p>He urged ar­bi­tra­tors not to be “un­duly con­cerned about the per­ceived risk of the un­en­force­abil­ity of any award they make stem­ming from their ro­bust man­age­ment of the pro­ceed­ings and their re­jec­tion of abu­sive re­quests”.</p>
    <p>He added that ar­bi­tra­tors must recog­nise that speed and ef­fi­ciency in the pro­ceed­ings are as much a cen­tral ex­pec­ta­tion of the par­ties as ad­her­ence to the stric­tures of due process.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond in­stance, Bri­tain’s Supreme Court ruled in a 3-2 de­ci­sion that where a con­tract or ar­bi­tra­tion agree­ment does not spec­ify which coun­try’s law is to be ap­plied when there is a dis­pute, then the ar­bi­tra­tion agree­ment shall be gov­erned by the law of the lo­ca­tion where the ar­bi­tra­tion is seated.</p>
    <p>In this case, the in­ter­na­tional con­tract in­volv­ing a Rus­sian firm and other par­ties had pro­vided for dis­putes to be re­solved by ar­bi­tra­tion in Lon­don. As a re­sult, English law ap­plied.</p>
    <p>In their joint de­ci­sion grounds for the ma­jor­ity view, Lord Jus­tice Ni­cholas Ham­blen and Lord Jus­tice Ge­orge Leg­gatt, with whom Lord Jus­tice Brian Kerr agreed, said “Sin­ga­pore pro­vides an in­struc­tive ex­am­ple”, and re­ferred to re­marks Jus­tice Steven Chong made in a Sin­ga­pore High Court de­ci­sion in 2016.</p>
    <p>The judge had said the choice of Sin­ga­pore as the seat of ar­bi­tra­tion did not dis­place the pre­sump­tion that New York law gov­erned an agree­ment spelt out in a con­tract. The case in­volved a for­eign bank – the plain­tiff – and a for­eign com­pany – the de­fen­dant – that were not named in keep­ing with ar­bi­tra­tion rules.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom Supreme Court noted that Jus­tice Chong’s view was ap­proved by the Sin­ga­pore Court of Ap­peal last year and ac­cepted by both par­ties as a cor­rect state­ment of the law.</p>
