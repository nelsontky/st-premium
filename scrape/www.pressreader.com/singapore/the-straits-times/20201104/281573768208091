    <p>Ant Group’s US$37 bil­lion (S$50.4 bil­lion) stock mar­ket list­ing has been suspended in both Shang­hai and Hong Kong in a dra­matic move just two days be­fore what was set to be the world’s largest-ever stock mar­ket de­but.</p>
    <p>The Shang­hai Stock Ex­change first an­nounced last night that it had suspended Ant’s ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO) on its Nas­daq-style Star Mar­ket, prompt­ing Ant to also freeze the Hong Kong leg of the dual list­ing.</p>
    <p>Ant said that its list­ing had been suspended fol­low­ing a re­cent in­ter­view reg­u­la­tors held with its founder Jack Ma and top ex­ec­u­tives. It said it may not meet list­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tions or dis­clo­sure re­quire­ments, and also cited re­cent changes in the fin­tech reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The Shang­hai Stock Ex­change de­scribed Ant’s meet­ing with Chi­nese fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tors as a “ma­jor event”.</p>
    <p>Ant was set to go public in Hong Kong and Shang­hai to­mor­row after rais­ing about US$37 bil­lion, in­clud­ing the over­al­lot­ment op­tion of the do­mes­tic leg, in a record public sale of shares. “This is a curve­ball that has been thrown at us... I don’t know what to say,” said a banker work­ing on the IPO.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors had sum­moned Mr Ma, Ant’s ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Eric Jing and chief ex­ec­u­tive Si­mon Hu to a meet­ing on Mon­day when they were told the com­pany’s lu­cra­tive on­line lend­ing busi­ness faced tighter gov­ern­ment scru­tiny, sources told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing came as the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties pub­lished new draft rules for on­line mi­cro-lend­ing.</p>
    <p>At the end of last month, Mr Ma had called fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tion out­dated and badly suited to com­pa­nies try­ing to use tech­nol­ogy to drive fi­nan­cial in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing has be­come more un­com­fort­able with banks heav­ily us­ing mi­cro-len­ders or third-party tech­nol­ogy plat­forms like Ant for un­der­writ­ing con­sumer loans, amid fears of ris­ing de­faults and de­te­ri­o­rat­ing as­set qual­ity in a pan­demic-hit economy.</p>
    <p>The move re­ver­ber­ated across mar­kets, with Alibaba Group Hold­ing fall­ing 9 per cent in US trad­ing, los­ing nearly US$76 bil­lion, more than dou­ble the amount Ant was go­ing to raise in its list­ing.</p>
    <p>Alibaba owns about a third of the pay­ments com­pany, which had at</p>
    <p>Ant has been hit with fresh rules in re­cent months as China tight­ens con­trol over on­line len­ders and com­pa­nies that op­er­ate mul­ti­ple fi­nan­cial busi­ness lines. These have in­cluded cap­i­tal and li­cens­ing re­quire­ments, a cap on loan rates and lim­its on Ant’s use of as­set-backed se­cu­ri­ties to fund quick con­sumer loans.</p>
    <p>tracted at least US$3 tril­lion of or­ders from in­di­vid­ual in­vestors for its dual list­ing in Hong Kong and Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>In the pre­lim­i­nary price con­sul­ta­tion of its Shang­hai IPO, in­sti­tu­tional i nvestors sub­scribed for over 76 bil­lion shares, more than 284 times the ini­tial of­fer­ing tranche.</p>
    <p>The fin­tech com­pany’s I PO would have given it a mar­ket value of about US$315 bil­lion based on fil­ings, big­ger than JPMor­gan Chase and four times larger than Gold­man Sachs Group.</p>
    <p>“This is a sig­nif­i­cant blow or developmen­t for both for the com­pany and other po­ten­tial fin­tech is­suers in Hong Kong and main­land China,” said cap­i­tal mar­kets con­sul­tant Philippe Espinasse.</p>
    <p>He noted that the sit­u­a­tion may call for a short-term clar­i­fi­ca­tion through an an­nounce­ment or sup­ple­men­tal prospec­tus, and in­vestors could be asked to re­con­firm their or­ders.</p>
    <p>But not many gen­er­ally would do so when some­thing like this hap­pens, he added.</p>
    <p>Alibaba Group said yes­ter­day that it will be “proac­tive” in sup­port­ing Ant Group to adapt to the evolv­ing reg­u­la­tory frame­work, adding that it “has full con­fi­dence in Ant Group col­leagues’ abil­ity to do a good job”.</p>
    <p>Ant Group said that it will prop­erly han­dle the fol­low-up mat­ters in ac­cor­dance with the reg­u­la­tions of the two stock ex­changes, and apol­o­gised to in­vestors for the in­con­ve­nience caused.</p>
    <p>Ant has been hit with fresh rules in re­cent months as China tight­ens con­trol over on­line len­ders and com­pa­nies that op­er­ate mul­ti­ple fi­nan­cial busi­ness lines.</p>
    <p>These have in­cluded cap­i­tal and li­cens­ing re­quire­ments, a cap on loan rates and lim­its on Ant’s use of as­set-backed se­cu­ri­ties to fund quick con­sumer loans.</p>
    <p>For­mer se­nior in­vest­ment banker Wang Jiyue said that the sus­pen­sion “does not nec­es­sar­ily mean can­cel­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The fi­nal list­ing is just a mat­ter of time. But with the on­line mi­crolend­ing rules freshly rolled out, Ant does have the re­spon­si­bil­ity to spell out the im­pact to its busi­ness,” he added.</p>
