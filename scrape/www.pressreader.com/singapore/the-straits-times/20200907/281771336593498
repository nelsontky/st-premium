    <p>Ms Elle Jef­fry saved about 11 per cent on the price of a new Pero­dua Bezza car last month, which she bought to re­place her 12-year-old ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>The club­house sales ex­ec­u­tive, who had spent more than two years con­tem­plat­ing whether to buy a new car, said the pur­chase was prac­ti­cal, given her fear of us­ing Malaysia’s pub­lic trans­port amid the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Elle paid about RM56,150 (S$18,530) for the 1.3 litre car, sav­ing about RM6,300, thanks to the sales tax waiver in­tro­duced by the gov­ern­ment and re­bates dished out by the car dealer.</p>
    <p>“I’m glad that dur­ing this try­ing time, the gov­ern­ment de­cided to step up and ex­empt car sales tax. Oth­er­wise, I would have to rely on pub­lic trans­port through­out this out­break since my pre­vi­ous car is not safe to drive around in any­more and su­per old,” Ms Elle, 32, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy be­cause, oth­er­wise, my fi­nances would al­low me to buy a new car only at the end of next year,” she added.</p>
    <p>She was not alone in rush­ing to car show­rooms in the past 21/</p>
    <p>2 months as the coun­try’s Covid-19 move­ment re­stric­tions were eased.</p>
    <p>Ve­hi­cle buy­ers now en­joy a 100 per cent sales tax ex­emp­tion on lo­cally-as­sem­bled mod­els and a 50 per cent waiver on fully-im­ported mod­els. The sales tax waiver started on June 15 and will last un­til Dec 31 this year.</p>
    <p>The tax ex­emp­tion, re­bates and pent-up de­mand com­bined to push up sales strongly, with 44,695 new ve­hi­cles sold in June, and ris­ing to 57,552 ve­hi­cles sold in July de­spite the eco­nomic slow­down, data re­leased by the Malaysian Au­to­mo­tive As­so­ci­a­tion showed. This rep­re­sented a nearly 5 per cent rise in car sales year on year for June, and a 13.2 per cent rise for July.</p>
    <p>Sales of Pero­dua cars jumped to 23,203 in July, triple its sales in May be­fore the tax ex­emp­tion, while Pro­ton’s July sales fig­ure was the high­est in eight years. The two lo­cal brands are the most pop­u­lar makes in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Malaysia i mposed move­ment curbs on March 18, forc­ing schools and non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses to shut down. The move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) was eased on May 4, al­low­ing most busi­nesses to grad­u­ally re­open and for peo­ple to travel for work.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the shut­down on car sales was se­vere. Only 143 ve­hi­cles were sold in April, com­pared with 49,935 in the same month last year. With the eas­ing of the curbs in May, sales i mproved to 23,309 units, but were still sharply be­low the 60,760 units sold in May last year.</p>
    <p>Thirty-two-year-old busi­ness­man Vin­cent Yeong said: “I bought a Toy­ota Al­phard in Au­gust and man­aged to save more than RM10,000 in sales taxes. I wouldn’t say I have ‘enough’ to sur­vive for at least a year if there’s an­other MCO, but I treat the pur­chase as my bid to help my coun­try with its econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>He de­clined to dis­close how much he paid for his new car.</p>
    <p>Still, those con­cerned about the eco­nomic out­look have taken ad­van­tage of the sales tax re­moval to down­grade to cheaper cars.</p>
    <p>A survey by au­to­mo­tive news site WapCar found that over 90 per cent of Malaysians are con­cerned about tak­ing pub­lic trans­port, with most opt­ing to lower their bud­get for a car.</p>
    <p>Sales ex­ec­u­tive Katy Chan said: “Hon­estly, there is so much un­cer­tainty, so I think it’s best to make nec­es­sary changes when we still have the chance in­stead of wait­ing for the worst to hap­pen first.”</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old has traded in her RM220,000 Mini Cooper for a RM52,000 Pero­dua MyVi.</p>
