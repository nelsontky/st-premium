    <p>LONDON • The Bri­tish govern­ment was yes­ter­day ex­pected to set out which Covid-19 re­stric­tions each lo­cal author­ity in Eng­land will face when a na­tional lock­down ends next week, al­low­ing busi­nesses to re­open i n ar­eas where in­fec­tion rates are lower.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son or­dered Eng­land into a month-long lock­down early this month af­ter cases and deaths started to rise again, an­ger­ing busi­nesses and some in his own po­lit­i­cal party over the economic con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>On Monday, he set out new mea­sures to re­place the l ock­down from next Wed­nes­day, re­in­forc­ing a pre­vi­ous re­gional ap­proach, and warn­ing that some ar­eas would move into a higher alert level than the one they were in be­fore. Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock was yes­ter­day due to tell Par­lia­ment which of three tiers – rang­ing from the low­est at tier one, to the high­est at tier three – each lo­cal author­ity will fall un­der.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment said al­lo­ca­tions will be made us­ing a de­ci­sion-mak­ing process based on rec­om­men­da­tions to min­is­ters from re­gional and na­tional pub­lic health ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Tier three means bars, cafes and restau­rants must re­main shut ex­cept for take­away ser­vices, and that house­holds can­not mix ex­cept in pub­lic places out­doors.</p>
    <p>Tier three ar­eas will be of­fered sup­port by the Na­tional Health Ser­vice Test and Trace and the armed forces to de­liver a six-week rapid com­mu­nity test­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“I know for those of you faced with tier three re­stric­tions, this will be a par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult time, but I want to re­as­sure you that we’ll be sup­port­ing your ar­eas with mass com­mu­nity test­ing and ex­tra fund­ing,” Mr Han­cock said.</p>
    <p>Tiers will be re­viewed on Dec 16, mak­ing it pos­si­ble for ar­eas that slow the spread to be moved down a tier be­fore Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has lob­bied for the cap­i­tal to be in tier two, warn­ing that tier three would be “cat­a­strophic” for the city’s hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester Mayor Andy Burn­ham ex­pected Greater Manch­ester to be re­turned to tier three.</p>
    <p>Scot­land, Wales and North­ern Ire­land are un­der vary­ing lev­els of re­stric­tions.</p>
