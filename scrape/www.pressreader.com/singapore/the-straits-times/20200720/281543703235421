    <p>2 The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has re­ported a record in­crease in global coro­n­avirus cases for the sec­ond day in a row. The surge in in­fec­tions means that one mil­lion cases were re­ported in un­der 100 hours. The big­gest in­creases were from the United States, Brazil, In­dia and South Africa.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has re­ported a record in­crease in global coro­n­avirus cases for the sec­ond day in a row, with t he to­tal ris­ing by 259,848 in 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The big­gest in­creases re­ported last Satur­day were from the United States, Brazil, In­dia and South Africa, ac­cord­ing to a daily re­port. The pre­vi­ous WHO record for new cases was 237,743 a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Deaths rose by 7,360, the big­gest one-day in­crease since May 10. Deaths have been averaging 4,800 a day this month, up slightly from an av­er­age of 4,600 a day in June.</p>
    <p>To­tal global coro­n­avirus cases sur­passed 14 mil­lion last Fri­day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, mark­ing an­other mile­stone in the spread of the disease that has killed nearly 600,000 peo­ple in seven months.</p>
    <p>The surge means that one mil­lion cases were re­ported in less than 100 hours.</p>
    <p>The WHO re­ported 71,484 new cases in the US, 45,403 in Brazil, 34,884 in In­dia and 13,373 in South Africa last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In­dia last Fri­day be­came the third coun­try in the world to record more than one mil­lion cases of the coro­n­avirus, be­hind only the US and Brazil. Epi­demi­ol­o­gists say In­dia is still likely months from hit­ting its peak, with the cur­rent toll at 1.08 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Cases in Brazil crossed the two mil­lion mark last Thurs­day, dou­bling in less than a month with nearly 40,000 new cases a day, and stood at 2.08 mil­lion yes­ter­day. A patch­work of state and city re­sponses has held up poorly in Brazil in the ab­sence of a tightly co­or­di­nated pol­icy from the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The US, which leads the world with more than 3.8 mil­lion cases, has also tried to curb the out­break at the state and lo­cal lev­els with only lim­ited suc­cess.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, a record 108 new cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day, the fi­nance hub’s leader said as she tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to tackle the surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>HK Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said more than 500 in­fec­tions had been con­firmed in the last fort­night alone, nearly a third of the to­tal since the out­break be­gan. Yes­ter­day’s new in­fec­tions take the to­tal there to 1,886 cases. “I think the sit­u­a­tion is re­ally crit­i­cal and there is no sign the sit­u­a­tion is be­ing brought un­der con­trol,” she told re­porters.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has sur­passed China in terms of the to­tal num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases, after record­ing 1,639 cases yes­ter­day and 1,752 new in­fec­tions the pre­vi­ous day. The new tally for In­done­sia is 86,521, while China re­ported 16 new cases to bring its to­tal to 83,660.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Health Min­istry disease con­trol and preven­tion di­rec­tor-gen­eral Ach­mad Yurianto also an­nounced 127 more Covid-19 deaths, a record death toll that took over­all In­done­sian fa­tal­i­ties to 4,143.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Mex­ico’s Health Min­istry also posted a record for new coro­n­avirus cases on a sin­gle day, with 7,615 more con­firmed cases, bring­ing its over­all tally of in­fec­tions to 338,913. The min­istry also re­ported 578 ad­di­tional fa­tal­i­ties, bring­ing the to­tal in the coun­try to 38,888 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Sin­ga­pore, the Min­istry of Health con­firmed 257 new coro­n­avirus cases as of noon yes­ter­day, tak­ing the coun­try’s to­tal to 47,912. Among them are eight new com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing two Sin­ga­pore­ans, one work pass holder and five work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
