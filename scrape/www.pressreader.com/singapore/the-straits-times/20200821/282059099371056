    <p>Mr Jared Koh, 20, grew up lis­ten­ing to his grand­fa­ther’s po­lice yarns, in­clud­ing his time as a beat cop in Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing years.</p>
    <p>A par­tic­u­larly mem­o­rable one is how Mr Tan Hang Meng, 78, his ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther, was tasked to en­force the cur­few dur­ing the 1964 racial ri­ots.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stood how vi­o­lent the clashes were from my his­tory les­sons in school... the thing that struck me most was that he wasn’t scared of en­forc­ing the cur­few; he said do your job prop­erly and peo­ple will re­spect you,” he said.</p>
    <p>These “grand­fa­ther sto­ries” so in­spired him that he de­cided to join the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force. Mr Koh was one of 14 peo­ple awarded Home Team Schol­ar­ships in a vir­tual cer­e­mony yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said his de­ci­sion to be­come a po­lice­man also stemmed from his own ex­pe­ri­ence in the Boys’ Bri­gade and Red Cross Youth uni­formed groups, and was fur­ther ce­mented when he was posted to the po­lice for his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>He is cur­rently with the Po­lice Coast Guard.</p>
    <p>Like his grand­fa­ther, he had to deal with un­ruly res­i­dents while on a short at­tach­ment with a neigh­bour­hood po­lice cen­tre, said Mr Koh, re­call­ing an in­ci­dent where he had to help man­age a drunk man who was cre­at­ing a ruckus.</p>
    <p>But un­like his grand­fa­ther, he has mod­ern tech­nol­ogy like smart­phones and po­lice cam­eras to help him in polic­ing work.</p>
    <p>In Mr Tan’s time, po­lice of­fi­cers had only ra­dios in their po­lice car, and they of­ten had to look for pay­phones to call their head­quar­ters, said Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>“But the main gist of (polic­ing) is al­ways the same: the po­lice are there to keep Sin­ga­pore safe and se­cure... and make sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans can live har­mo­niously with one an­other. This as­pect of po­lice work will never change,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, a for­mer Vic­to­ria Ju­nior Col­lege stu­dent, plans to study law in the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>Other schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents in this year’s batch in­clude Mr Li Kan­gli, 22, who did a stint with the Home Af­fairs Min­istry’s dig­i­tal and foren­sics team dur­ing his NS.</p>
    <p>He will study com­puter science at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, and serve his bond in the Home Team Science and Tech­nol­ogy Agency.</p>
    <p>This year’s Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force Schol­ar­ship, one of the most pres­ti­gious schol­ar­ships awarded by the Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion, went to Ms Sun­daram Mo­han Shak­thi, 19, and Mr Sim Zheng Hao, 21.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim, who will be study­ing lib­eral arts in New York Univer­sity, said he hopes to build on the po­lice’s com­mu­nity part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>He added: “What I have learnt this year, with Covid-19 and events all around the world... is the im­por­tance of flex­i­bil­ity and em­pa­thy when lis­ten­ing to peo­ple on the ground.”</p>
    <p>In an ad­dress dur­ing the vir­tual cer­e­mony, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said the high level of trust the pub­lic have in Home Team agen­cies can be eas­ily lost if peo­ple feel the agen­cies are no longer act­ing to pro­tect them, as re­cent de­vel­op­ments in other coun­tries have shown.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic as an­other chal­lenge, he added: “The Home Team will con­tinue to need strong and ca­pa­ble lead­ers who can lead our of­fi­cers, pre­pare for and tackle fu­ture crises and main­tain the very high level of pub­lic trust that we have to­day.”</p>
