    <p>Tax­pay­ers contribute­d more to the Gov­ern­ment’s cof­fers in the past fi­nan­cial year, but an­a­lysts cau­tion that the pace could slow down on the back of the Covid-19 pan­demic. The In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore col­lected $53.5 bil­lion in taxes in the fis­cal year 2019/20, 2.1 per cent more than a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Tax­pay­ers, both cor­po­rate and in­di­vid­ual, contribute­d more to the Gov­ern­ment’s cof­fers in the past fi­nan­cial year, but an­a­lysts cau­tion that the pace could slow down on the back of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras) col­lected $53.5 bil­lion in taxes in the fis­cal year 2019/20, which is 2.1 per cent more than a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to its an­nual re­port re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion ac­counted for 72 per cent of gov­ern­ment op­er­at­ing rev­enue, and 10.5 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP), or eco­nomic out­put.</p>
    <p>But go­ing for­ward, May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin ex­pects to­tal tax col­lec­tion to fall by around 10 per cent this fi­nan­cial year, with cor­po­rate in­come tax and goods and ser­vices tax (GST) tak­ing the big­gest hit from the eco­nomic down­turn. “Stamp du­ties may not fall as much be­cause prop­erty trans­ac­tions have been more re­silient,” he said.</p>
    <p>KPMG tax di­rec­tor See Wei Hwa said that while the med­i­cal and bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sec­tors have done well, many com­pa­nies in other sec­tors have been ad­versely af­fected.</p>
    <p>“We would ex­pect in­come tax col­lec­tion to fall sig­nif­i­cantly in tan­dem with the over­all de­cline in the Sin­ga­pore GDP,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has slashed its full-year growth fore­cast to between mi­nus 5 per cent and mi­nus 7 per cent, its worst-ever con­trac­tion and first full-year re­ces­sion in al­most two decades. The Gov­ern­ment has com­mit­ted around $100 bil­lion in Covid-19 sup­port this year, and is ex­pected to draw up to $52 bil­lion from past re­serves.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment on Thurs­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said that GST col­lec­tions this year are pro­jected to be down by 14 per cent from ini­tial es­ti­mates be­fore the start of the year, mainly due to travel dis­rup­tions and the im­pact of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>To­day, the bulk of Sin­ga­pore’s tax rev­enue comes from in­come tax, com­pris­ing cor­po­rate in­come tax, in­di­vid­ual in­come tax and with­hold­ing tax. It amounted to $30.8 bil­lion, or 57 per cent of Iras’ col­lec­tion for the 12 months ended March 31.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­rate tax rev­enue grew 4.3 per cent year on year to $16.7 bil­lion, while per­sonal in­come tax col­lec­tion went up by 5.7 per cent to $12.4 bil­lion. Th­ese two ar­eas ac­count for over half of to­tal tax col­lec­tions.</p>
    <p>The next big­gest cat­e­gory of tax rev­enue was the GST, mak­ing up 21 per cent of to­tal col­lec­tion. It inched up by 0.2 per cent to $11.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>KPMG head of in­di­rect tax Lam Kok Shang said that GST col­lec­tion could plunge next year due to the col­lapse in tourist num­bers, re­trenched for­eign staff go­ing back to their home coun­tries and Sin­ga­pore­ans tight­en­ing their spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect that once the econ­omy re­cov­ers, the GST rate in­crease will hap­pen sooner in the time­frame of 2022 to 2023, rather than later,” he said, re­fer­ring to the GST in­crease to 9 per cent which will take place by 2025.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Mack­ender, the in­di­rect tax leader for Deloitte Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia, said a full re­cov­ery in GST col­lec­tion is un­likely un­til the travel and tourism sec­tors are back to nor­mal, “which could be a long while yet”.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment still needs rev­enue from tax­a­tion, so we should ex­pect to see more at­ten­tion paid to tax­payer com­pli­ance as the econ­omy re­cov­ers,” he said.</p>
