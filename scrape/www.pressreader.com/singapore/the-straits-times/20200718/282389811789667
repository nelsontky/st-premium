    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries took a ma­jor hit in the first half as its earn­ings tum­bled amid the pan­demic with worse to come, it warned yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It recorded a net loss of $131 mil­lion for the six months to June 30 com­pared with a $191 mil­lion net profit in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The firm also in­di­cated that more red ink is on the way: “The group ex­pects to in­cur losses for the full year due to the ex­pected con­tin­u­ing losses at Sem­b­corp Marine and ex­cep­tional items recorded in (the first half).”</p>
    <p>Three of its four units – en­ergy, marine and cor­po­rate – racked up losses.</p>
    <p>The only unit to re­port a net profit – $38 mil­lion – was its ur­ban seg­ment, which han­dles projects such as in­dus­trial parks and busi­ness, com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial spa­ces in Asia.</p>
    <p>Its marine seg­ment was the hard­est hit, chalk­ing up a net loss of $117 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>While the marine busi­ness is re­sum­ing grad­u­ally, Sem­b­corp noted that the out­look in sub­se­quent quar­ters will depend on how soon its work­force will be al­lowed to re­turn to full strength.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the re­duced eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in mul­ti­ple mar­kets due to the pan­demic has also de­pressed en­ergy de­mand and prices, Sem­b­corp noted.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond quar­ter, en­ergy de­mand in Sin­ga­pore, In­dia and the UK de­clined by ap­prox­i­mately 5 per cent to 20 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>“The un­der­ly­ing per­for­mance of the en­ergy busi­ness in 2020 is ex­pected to be markedly lower than in 2019,” it said.</p>
    <p>The en­ergy seg­ment recorded a $5 mil­lion net loss, a dras­tic re­ver­sal from the $177 mil­lion net profit it re­ported in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp added that the net profit for its en­ergy busi­ness for the full year is also ex­pected to be af­fected by the loss of con­tri­bu­tion from di­vested as­sets and the ab­sence of one-off in­come in Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>Other ex­cep­tional items, in­clud­ing a loss of $161 mil­lion and the ex­pected cur­rency loss upon the com­ple­tion of its Chilean wa­ter busi­ness, are ex­pected to have an ad­verse im­pact on full-year net profit.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp shares closed flat at $1.78 yes­ter­day.</p>
