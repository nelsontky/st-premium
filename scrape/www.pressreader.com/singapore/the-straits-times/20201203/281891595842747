    <p>A group of ter­ror­ists who killed four Chris­tians last week in Cen­tral Su­lawesi prov­ince have split up into two or three smaller groups in the jun­gle as they are be­ing pur­sued by the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing mil­i­tary spe­cial forces, ac­cord­ing to a se­nior field mil­i­tary of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times on Tues­day that the group of 11 men split up to avoid de­tec­tion as they were cor­nered. He said they had de­scended from the higher moun­tain ar­eas and were near the bor­ders of Poso and Sigi re­gen­cies in Cen­tral Su­lawesi.</p>
    <p>“We used to do our track­ing work re­ly­ing on IT (in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy), but to­day they do not use a sin­gle mo­bile phone,” said the se­nior field mil­i­tary of­fi­cer based in Poso, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity. “That in­ci­dent is a blow to us.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice be­lieve the ex­trem­ist East­ern In­done­sia Mu­jahideen (MIT) group killed the Chris­tian fam­ily of four and torched six homes, in­clud­ing one fre­quently used to hold mass prayers, in a re­mote village of Lem­ban Ton­goa in the prov­ince. Two of the vic­tims were be­headed.</p>
    <p>The killings last Fri­day in a re­mote lo­ca­tion where trans­port is dif­fi­cult have prompted Jakarta to de­ploy spe­cial forces from the mil­i­tary to beef up the man­hunt.</p>
    <p>The MIT, led by Ali Kalora, had pledged al­le­giance to the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria. Ali Kalora took over the lead­er­ship of MIT from San­toso, who was once In­done­sia’s most-wanted ter­ror­ist. San­toso was killed in July 2016 af­ter a mas­sive man­hunt.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have been hunt­ing for the Kalora-led MIT for the last few months. On Tues­day and yes­ter­day, spe­cial forces units from both the Marines and the army’s Strate­gic Re­serve Com­mand (Kostrad) joined the man­hunt.</p>
    <p>The MIT mil­i­tants de­scended from the moun­tain­top ar­eas af­ter In­done­sian of­fi­cers in­ten­sively combed Cen­tral Su­lawesi’s deeply forested area.</p>
    <p>“We have been re­ly­ing on hu­man in­tel­li­gence in­for­ma­tion. We have to do quick fol­low-up ac­tions af­ter any re­port from vil­lagers who spot­ted any of the wanted ter­ror­ists,” the field of­fi­cer said.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos of the 11 wanted mil­i­tants have been dis­trib­uted to cities and vil­lages in the prov­ince.</p>
    <p>MIT is be­lieved to have only 11 mem­bers left af­ter two mem­bers of the group, iden­ti­fied as Wahid, alias Bo­jes, and Aziz Arifin, were spot­ted de­scend­ing from higher moun­tain ar­eas near the pro­vin­cial cap­i­tal of Palu in the mid­dle of last month.</p>
    <p>They were tailed to a re­gency about two hours’ drive from Palu and were killed.</p>
    <p>“They were try­ing to get sup­plies as they ran out of food and lo­gis­tics up there. The two came down and were given food by vil­lagers. They also man­aged to meet a vil­lager (who sup­ported their cause), who let them use his mo­tor­cy­cle,” the field of­fi­cer told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Anti-ter­ror ex­pert Adhe Bhakti of the Cen­tre for Rad­i­cal­ism and De­rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion Stud­ies (Pakar) said a few in­ci­dents in­di­cated that MIT has weak­ened. The ar­rests last month of two MIT mil­i­tants sig­nalled their des­per­a­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>In another in­ci­dent on April 15, two of Ali Kalora’s fol­low­ers, Muis Fahron and Dar­win Go­bel, wounded a mo­bile brigade po­lice of­fi­cer out­side a Bank Syariah Mandiri branch in Poso and tried to snatch an as­sault ri­fle from the of­fi­cer, but failed.</p>
    <p>The two mil­i­tants quickly left the scene and, hours later, were hunted down and killed by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“Ali Kalora and his fol­low­ers (have) min­i­mal lo­gis­tics right now, both in terms of weaponry and other equip­ment,” Mr Adhe said. “The Lem­ban Ton­goa killings (last Fri­day) could be them (tak­ing re­venge against) the po­lice and mil­i­tary.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has con­demned last Fri­day’s killings, say­ing there is no place for ter­ror­ism any­where in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“That bar­baric act is clearly meant to pro­voke and ter­rorise the pub­lic, and to dis­turb the unity and har­mony among the peo­ple,” Mr Joko said in a state­ment on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>He in­vited ev­ery­one to stay united to fight against ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>Mr Adhe said the Lem­ban Ton­goa in­ci­dent is un­likely to spark any con­flict be­tween the Chris­tians and Mus­lims, as res­i­dents un­der­stand and see it as a ter­ror­ist act.</p>
    <p>Poso, a sleepy Cen­tral Su­lawesi town, had a bloody his­tory of sec­tar­ian con­flict from 1997 to 2000, when hun­dreds of peo­ple were killed and thou­sands fled their homes.</p>
    <p>In a video broad­cast that was shared on so­cial me­dia, lead­ers of the Poso In­ter­faith Com­mu­ni­ca­tion Fo­rum (FKUB) ap­pealed to all res­i­dents of all re­li­gions to stay united, not be pro­voked by last Fri­day’s in­ci­dent, and trust the au­thor­i­ties to in­ves­ti­gate the case.</p>
