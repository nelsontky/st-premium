    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Less than three weeks ago, TPC Hard­ing Park, a city-owned golf course, was roamed by duf­fers of all abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>About 65,000 rounds are played at the fa­cil­ity in a typ­i­cal year, plus an­other 30,000 at the nine-hole course tucked in­side the 18-hole lay­out.</p>
    <p>Some pay as lit­tle as about US$50 (S$68.50) a round, de­pend­ing on res­i­dency and the day’s de­mand.</p>
    <p>But un­til Sun­day, the world’s best golfers will be at Hard­ing Park for the PGA Cham­pi­onship, the first Ma­jor in this coro­n­avirus-hit sea­son. “It’s a big-boy golf course,” said Brooks Koepka, the two-time de­fend­ing cham­pion. “Tough place. Tough setup.”</p>
    <p>It sounds like a magic trick. How could the same patch of grass and trees go from be­ing so ac­ces­si­ble to recre­ational golfers to so fore­bod­ing to the pros?</p>
    <p>The trans­for­ma­tive task fell largely to Kerry Haigh, chief cham­pi­onships of­fi­cer for the PGA of Amer­ica, and the lo­cal parks and re­cre­ation crews that main­tain the course, even this week.</p>
    <p>Their method made the most of time, imag­i­na­tion and ge­om­e­try, all made trick­ier by Hard­ing Park’s avail­abil­ity till July 17.</p>
    <p>“Tee times ev­ery day from dawn to dusk make it chal­leng­ing for any­one to grow grass and pre­pare a golf course in cham­pi­onship con­di­tion be­cause of how dif­fi­cult it is to even get onto the golf course and work i n an ef­fi­cient man­ner,” Haigh said.</p>
    <p>“You’ve got to keep clear of golfers that aren’t al­ways hit­ting it straight all the time.”</p>
    <p>Hard­ing Park has held top PGA Tour events be­fore, in­clud­ing the 2009 Pres­i­dents Cup, but this will be its first Ma­jor tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Com­pared to the few other Amer­i­can mu­nic­i­pal cour­ses in its elite class, like Beth­page Black on Long Is­land and Tor­rey Pines in San Diego, Hard­ing Park feels com­fort­ably un­spec­tac­u­lar, like a fa­mil­iar bar. That is its charm.</p>
    <p>That rep­u­ta­tion owes as much to its lo­ca­tion as it does the course’s lack of meant-to-im­press flour­ishes like those at cloaked coun­try clubs else­where.</p>
    <p>Hard­ing Park is an ur­ban play­ground that sits next to San Fran­cisco State Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>There is no chateaux-style club­house, and amid the cart-pulling, bag-car­ry­ing golfers are jog­gers and dog walk­ers and you can take the Muni, San Fran­cisco’s tran­sit sys­tem, to get there.</p>
    <p>But the course is blessed with a classic lay­out – tight fair­ways lined by ma­jes­tic cy­press trees, its front nine folded in­side a back nine that un­winds along­side Lake Merced.</p>
    <p>It is all made un­pre­dictable by San Fran­cisco’s fa­mous cool sum­mer wind and fog. Tem­per­a­tures un­til this week­end are ex­pected to be be­tween 10 and 15 deg C.</p>
    <p>“If you’re a lit­tle per­snick­ety about your golf cli­mate, Hard­ing’s not for you,” said Phil Gins­burg, gen­eral man­ager of the city’s Re­cre­ation and Park Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Hard­ing Park will play longer this week at 7,251 yards, ex­tended about 800 yards from the white tees fa­mil­iar to lo­cals. But length­en­ing a course is the easy part.</p>
    <p>Haigh said he spent most of his time cal­cu­lat­ing an­gles, try­ing to force golfers this week­end to use their men­tal pro­trac­tors to con­quer the course.</p>
    <p>Fair­ways were nar­rowed be­tween thick rough and some were moved to one side or the other to put more trees and bunkers in play.</p>
    <p>“I’m a great be­liever that if you can make any golfer think and have to sort of strate­gise, then they en­joy – and we en­joy – the game a lot more,” Haigh said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals might also no­tice that the longer grass that slowed stray shots from rolling into many fair­way bunkers is gone.</p>
    <p>“With the over­hang of these cy­press trees, there may be a cou­ple lost balls here,” Tiger Woods said of the course he played as an ama­teur and where he won the 2005 WGC</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Ex­press Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“Cut a cor­ner and the ball hangs up there.”</p>
    <p>Haigh said he does not al­ter cour­ses with pro­jected scores in mind.</p>
    <p>But the changes to the course – the length, the an­gles, the rough, the faster greens – prob­a­bly add 10 strokes to Hard­ing Park’s dif­fi­culty usu­ally faced by lo­cals. Scor­ing will be tighter, too, with the par set at 70 in­stead of the usual 72.</p>
