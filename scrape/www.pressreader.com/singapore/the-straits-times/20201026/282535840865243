    <p>EL­LIOT WONG AGE: 32 HEIGHT: 1.84m WEIGHT: 78kg</p>
    <p>For sports en­thu­si­ast El­liot Wong, keep­ing fit is a fam­ily af­fair. His ear­li­est mem­o­ries were of ex­er­cis­ing with his fam­ily ev­ery week­end.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents in­stilled in my el­der brother and me the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing an ac­tive life­style,” said the mar­ket­ing as­so­ciate at global bank J. P. Morgan.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily of four would ex­er­cise or play sports ev­ery Satur­day, he said.</p>
    <p>Bad­minton was his first brush with sports, which quickly be­came his first pas­sion.</p>
    <p>“My grand­uncle was a com­pet­i­tive bad­minton player, so it be­came our fam­ily sport. I was play­ing bad­minton as soon as I was able to pick up a racket and our fam­ily had weekly train­ing ses­sions,” said Mr Wong, who com­peted in in­ter-school bad­minton com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>He later took up run­ning and swim­ming as he watched his el­der brother, 37, race in triathlons and half-Iron­man events. His dad ran his first marathon in his early 50s.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong be­gan run­ning in earnest in Mel­bourne, where he went to do a de­gree in business at Monash Univer­sity in 2009.</p>
    <p>“The cooler cli­mate was a nat­u­ral source of en­cour­age­ment. I could run for kilo­me­tres with­out the hu­mid­ity weigh­ing me down.”</p>
    <p>He has since par­tic­i­pated in the Me­taSprint Se­ries half-triathlons and is the J. P. Morgan Sin­ga­pore team cap­tain of the an­nual J. P. Morgan Cor­po­rate Chal­lenge, which took place vir­tu­ally from Oct 8 to last Thurs­day, in which he ran 5.6km.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily re­mains his in­spi­ra­tion for keep­ing fit, he said. “My par­ents are in their 60s, but my fa­ther still cy­cles 50km and my mother swims weekly. And my brother con­tin­ues with his runs. They are my role mod­els.”</p>
