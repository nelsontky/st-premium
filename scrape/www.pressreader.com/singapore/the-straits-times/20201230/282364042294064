    <p>MORE TIME NEEDED</p>
    <p>After their £200 mil­lion-plus (S$358.3 mil­lion) trans­fer out­lay in the sum­mer, the pres­sure is on Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard to de­liver the Premier League ti­tle.</p>
    <p>But pun­dits like Chris Sut­ton do not be­lieve the Blues have what it takes for a ti­tle tilt after a re­cent poor run of form that has seen them take just four points from their past five Premier League games.</p>
    <p>Chelsea’s lat­est stum­ble came on Mon­day as they drew 1-1 with high­fly­ing Aston Villa, who leapfrogge­d the hosts into fifth place on goal dif­fer­ence, at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>Timo Werner was dropped fol­low­ing a bar­ren run in the league go­ing back to Nov 7 for Olivier Giroud, who opened the scor­ing with his third goal in four league starts this sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Villa drew level in the sec­ond half when An­war El Ghazi side-footed home a vol­ley for his fifth goal in as many top-flight games de­spite Chelsea protest­ing that An­dreas Christense­n had been fouled in the build-up by Jack Gre­al­ish.</p>
    <p>Af­ter­wards, Lam­pard blamed his team’s dip on the ab­sence of Hakim Ziyech, who has been out since Dec 5.</p>
    <p>On the winger, another block­buster sign­ing in the last win­dow, he said: “The way he was play­ing, he was be­ing very ef­fec­tive for us in terms of as­sists, goal cre­ation, chance cre­ation and some goals.</p>
    <p>“We were very fluid at the time. You’re go­ing to miss play­ers at that level when they drop out and we want him back.</p>
    <p>“This is our tough pe­riod at the mo­ment. We have to fight for it and we’ll be stronger for it... The new play­ers are go­ing to get better as they come along.”</p>
    <p>Ziyech is set to re­turn for their next league game against Manch­ester City on Sun­day un­less it is post­poned but Sut­ton is not con­vinced he is the an­ti­dote to their ills.</p>
    <p>“They are flat and that’s why Frank needs to get a few wins un­der his belt and ex­tremely quickly be­cause it can, as we know, turn ugly at Chelsea,” the for­mer Blues striker said.</p>
    <p>“Whether we like it or not, this is a to­tally dif­fer­ent sea­son for Frank.</p>
    <p>The pres­sure is on – he has spent the big money. Now the pres­sure will build. Timo Werner has been a mas­sive dis­ap­point­ment and Kai Havertz (one league goal in 14 league games) has been too.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea de­fender Reece James has, how­ever, launched an im­pas­sioned de­fence of Lam­pard, say­ing on In­sta­gram: “’I feel for Frank be­cause a lot of peo­ple are putting him un­der pres­sure but what peo­ple aren’t re­mem­ber­ing is that we are in a re­build.</p>
    <p>“The big names that have come in are just adapt­ing to a new style of foot­ball, lan­guage, team­mates and many other things go­ing on in their new lives...</p>
    <p>“For sure, I’m back­ing Frank all the way.”</p>
    <p>I feel for Frank be­cause a lot of peo­ple are putting him un­der pres­sure but what peo­ple aren’t re­mem­ber­ing is that we are in a re­build.</p>
