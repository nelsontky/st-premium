    <p>• Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics may launch its flag­ship Gal­axy S smart­phones more than a month ear­lier than ex­pected in a bid to grab mar­ket share from Huawei and fend off com­pe­ti­tion from Ap­ple, three sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>Huawei Tech­nolo­gies once chal­lenged Sam­sung’s top po­si­tion in the global smart­phone mar­ket, but the Chi­nese ri­val is in sur­vival mode with United States re­stric­tions chok­ing off its sup­plies of chips used in smart­phones and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment.</p>
    <p>South Korean chip in­dus­try of­fi­cials hope Mr Joe Bi­den’s pres­i­dency will ease some of those re­stric­tions, although they are far from cer­tain as they also ex­pect the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion to main­tain a tough stance on China.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung is pre­par­ing to launch its Gal­axy S21 as early as late Jan­uary next year, whereas it pre­vi­ously launched its flag­ship S20 phone in early March this year, the sources said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the plan is not pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The South Korean com­pany shipped 59 per cent fewer Gal­axy S20 5G se­ries hand­sets in the US in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous model’s per­for­mance a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to re­search firm Canalys.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Ap­ple shipped 15 per cent more of its flag­ship iPhone 11 than last year’s best­seller, the iPhone XR.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung, which lost its No. 1 po­si­tion to Huawei in the sec­ond quar­ter, re­gained the crown i n the third quar­ter, thanks in part to the US re­stric­tions on Huawei.</p>
    <p>A per­son at one ma­jor sup­plier of smart­phone chips said Huawei’s stock­piles were ex­pected to run out some time early next year.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung, how­ever, faces in­ten­si­fy­ing com­pe­ti­tion from Chi­nese ri­vals such as Xiaomi and Oppo, which are ex­pected to take ad­van­tage of Huawei’s strug­gle to re­tain mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple also launched its iPhone se­ries last month, about a month later than usual, step­ping up com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
