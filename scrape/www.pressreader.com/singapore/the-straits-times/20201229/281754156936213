    <p>The truck bomb that ex­ploded in the early hours of Christ­mas Day in Nashville, Ten­nessee, seemed al­most de­signed not to kill peo­ple – only three were in­jured. A 15-minute warning even em­anated from the RV (recre­ational ve­hi­cle) that it was about to ex­plode, giv­ing po­lice time to evac­u­ate res­i­dents in the area.</p>
    <p>What it might have been tar­get­ing was in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The bomb went off next to an AT&T telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions fa­cil­ity. The shock reached far beyond the city and even the state: cell­phone, In­ter­net and Wi-Fi ser­vices were dis­rupted over a wide area. Ac­cord­ing to the As­so­ci­ated Press, emer­gency systems in Alabama and Ken­tucky were also af­fected. The domino ef­fect dis­rupted air traf­fic con­trol as well, ground­ing flights at Nashville’s airport.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity ex­perts noted that the bomb­ing, which ap­pears to have been an elab­o­rate sui­cide, was a wake-up call about the vulnerabil­ity of crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent also came at a time of ex­cep­tional fragility, with the coun­try deeply di­vided and still nav­i­gat­ing a con­tested political tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the Fed­eral Bureau of</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) and po­lice con­firmed that the per­pe­tra­tor – 63-year-old long-time Nashville res­i­dent An­thony Quinn Warner – was in the RV when it ex­ploded. The fo­cus is now on the dead man’s mo­ti­va­tion for the method, tim­ing and lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Ter­ror­ism ex­pert and pro­fes­sor of com­mu­ni­ca­tion and Mid­dle</p>
    <p>East stud­ies at Ge­or­gia State Univer­sity Mia Bloom cau­tioned in a se­ries of tweets against rush­ing to la­bel Warner as a “ter­ror­ist” or “sui­cide bomber”.</p>
    <p>“Sui­cide bomb­ing re­quires some political mo­tive to send a mes­sage,” she wrote. “There are sev­eral pre-at­tack in­di­ca­tors of which clear­ing his debts, pay­ing off bills, sign­ing away the deed to his homes are con­sis­tent with some­one who as­sumes they will die. For me, the ques­tion is where did he get the ex­plo­sive? If he’s a lone ac­tor, who did he tell?”</p>
    <p>Dr Colin P. Clarke, se­nior re­search fel­low at The So­ufan Cen­tre, a global se­cu­rity con­sul­tancy, told The Straits</p>
    <p>Times: “It all comes down to mo­tive. If this was just sui­cide, then it’s not ter­ror­ism. But if the in­tent was to send a mes­sage, political or ide­o­log­i­cal, then it is.”</p>
    <p>Warner’s mo­tive may have had some­thing to do with where he parked the RV. As Mr John Cooper, mayor of Nashville, told CBS on Sun­day: “To all of us lo­cally, it feels like there has to be some con­nec­tion with the AT&T fa­cil­ity and the site of the bomb­ing. That’s just lo­cal in­sight, be­cause it’s got to have some­thing to do with the in­fra­struc­ture.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to some re­ports, Warner, an elec­tron­ics ex­pert, lived a low-key life with no vis­i­ble signs of political be­liefs. In­ves­ti­ga­tors are try­ing to find out if he bought into con­spir­acy the­o­ries about 5G tech­nol­ogy – that it spreads the coro­n­avirus, sup­presses the im­mune sys­tem, or is be­ing used to spy on Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Cell­phone tow­ers in Eng­land and New Zealand have been dam­aged on the ba­sis of these the­o­ries.</p>
    <p>At least eight cell­phone tow­ers in Ten­nessee have been van­dalised since De­cem­ber last year, the Chat­tanooga Times Free Press re­ported last month. “It is sus­pected that 5G con­spir­acy the­o­ries may have played a role,” said Ten­nessee Depart­ment of Safety and Home­land Se­cu­rity spokesman Wes Mosley.</p>
    <p>Mr Frank Figli­uzzi, a for­mer as­sis­tant FBI direc­tor, told CBS’ Face The Na­tion on Sun­day that Warner’s act is a warning about how vul­ner­a­ble the na­tion’s in­fra­struc­ture is, such that it was rel­a­tively easy for a sin­gle in­di­vid­ual to cause such ex­ten­sive dam­age.</p>
    <p>“We’ve con­cen­trated post-9/11 on get­ting our hands around all the chem­i­cal com­pa­nies’ mass or­ders of pre­cur­sors for known ex­plo­sives, and look what an in­di­vid­ual can do on his or her own, when they sim­ply amass quan­ti­ties of things that are un­der the radar screen,” he said.</p>
