    <p>It had been a dif­fi­cult year for Mr Ab­dul Rahim Sa­fari, 56.</p>
    <p>Like many oth­ers, the ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cer had to work longer hours due to new work from home ar­range­ments, and could not go vis­it­ing or go for prayers at the mosque dur­ing Hari Raya. In ad­di­tion, he was hos­pi­talised in March for sus­pected ap­pen­dix is­sues.</p>
    <p>So, the New Year’s Eve celebratio­n with his fam­ily was some­thing he had been look­ing for­ward to.</p>
    <p>“The end of the cur­rent year will be like the clos­ing to a chap­ter, start­ing a fresh one with the next,” the Yew Tee res­i­dent said.</p>
    <p>He and his fam­ily joined the fes­tiv­i­ties vir­tu­ally this year due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We were wor­ried about the crowd, so we’d rather stay at home and keep our­selves safe while cel­e­brat­ing,” said Mr Ab­dul Rahim, adding that his mother-in-law is 86, and might have se­ri­ous com­pli­ca­tions if she caught Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“This year, we have re­ally suf­fered. My (New Year’s) wish is that Sin­ga­pore will be free from Covid-19 and that we can en­joy our­selves as nor­mal,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Rahim and his fam­ily were among Sin­ga­pore­ans who rang in the new year with com­mu­nity count­down pro­grammes, which went vir­tual for the first time in the heart­land. Sev­eral of these in­cluded a live stream of fire­works dis­plays in the neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant Ed­mund Chua, 45, and his fam­ily of four were among res­i­dents who could see the fire­works from their homes.</p>
    <p>They had a top-down view of the dis­play from his 44th-storey flat in Hen­der­son Road.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing gone through a dif­fi­cult 2020 – his fa­ther died in Oc­to­ber, and he had to wind up his travel busi­ness – Mr Chua said “the only way to go is up”.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, in 2021, we get back to­wards nor­malcy and things will get bet­ter and bet­ter,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bar­ri­cades were seen around heart­land sites where fire­works were set off, with police and aux­il­iary of­fi­cers, as well as com­mu­nity vol­un­teers, help­ing with crowd con­trol.</p>
    <p>In Bis­han, peo­ple gath­ered to watch fire­works launched from the open field next to the Junc­tion 8 mall. Some came pre­pared with fold­ing chairs, while oth­ers sim­ply stood on the wet grass and waited.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent Sa­muel Mok, 24, who was there with his cam­era, said it had been some years since he cel­e­brated New Year’s Eve back in Sin­ga­pore, as he has been study­ing in Bri­tain for the past three years.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally like (the heart­land celebratio­n). Let’s say you go to Gar­dens by the Bay to take pho­tos, it tends to get very crowded, and of­ten, it’s hard to get public trans­port</p>
    <p>back home. Here, it’s closer to most res­i­dents, and for some of us as well, there are more op­tions to get home,” he said.</p>
    <p>Den­tist Sophia Yee, 33, had been wait­ing pa­tiently with her cam­era since 10.30pm. “I don’t mind the more muted cel­e­bra­tions – I don’t usu­ally do much any­way, so the fact that there’s fire­works in the neigh­bour­hood is nice,” she said.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents in Tampines were treated to an on­line con­cert with</p>
    <p>mu­sic per­for­mances and a game show, be­fore the night ended with a fire­works dis­play streamed from Our Tampines Hub. The in­te­grated com­mu­nity hub was buzzing with ac­tiv­ity, with groups of friends and fam­i­lies gath­ered in the atrium and public spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Re­tired busi­ness­man Tay Hock</p>
    <p>Lee, 75, was among res­i­dents who watched the con­cert in the atrium be­fore go­ing across the road to see the fire­works.</p>
    <p>“My neigh­bours and I usu­ally come here dur­ing cel­e­bra­tions like Na­tional Day and New Year’s, and it’s great that we can see the fire­works near our homes in­stead of trav­el­ling to town,” he said.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent Rachel Wong, 17, said it was more crowded than ex­pected, but she en­joyed the fes­tive spirit at the com­mu­nity hub.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter a year of so many ups and downs, it’s nice to cel­e­brate a bit with friends and loved ones, and hope­fully in 2021, things will get bet­ter,” she said, adding that she hopes leisure travel will re­sume by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>While the usual fire­works dis­play was ab­sent at Ma­rina Bay this year, the skies were il­lu­mi­nated with a spe­cial light dis­play.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tive pro­jec­tion of light rays, de­signed to sym­bol­ise unity, pos­i­tiv­ity and resilience, was meant to rep­re­sent Sin­ga­pore­ans’ spirit in nav­i­gat­ing the pan­demic last year and de­ter­mi­na­tion to emerge stronger in 2021.</p>
