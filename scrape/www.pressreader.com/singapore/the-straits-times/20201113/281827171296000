    <p>SEOUL/TOKYO/WILMINGTON (Delaware) • In their first calls with Mr Joe Bi­den since the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, the lead­ers of Ja­pan, South Korea and Aus­tralia yes­ter­day reaf­firmed plans to form close ties with the Pres­i­dent-elect to tackle var­i­ous is­sues, in­clud­ing cli­mate change and re­gional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in and Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son joined other global lead­ers in recog­nis­ing the Demo­cratic chal­lenger’s Nov 3 vic­tory over in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump, who has so far re­fused to con­cede.</p>
    <p>All sides ex­pressed their de­ter­mi­na­tion to strengthen bi­lat­eral ties as well as tackle global is­sues such as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and cli­mate change, Mr Bi­den’s of­fice said.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den said that he looks for­ward to strength­en­ing the US-Ja­pan al­liance and work­ing to­gether on achiev­ing a free and open Indo-Pa­cific,” Mr Suga told re­porters at the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den had ear­lier spo­ken to the lead­ers of Ger­many, Bri­tain, Canada and France, but China and Rus­sia have so far held off pass­ing on their con­grat­u­la­tions and speak­ing with the Pres­i­dent-elect.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Mr Moon, Mr Bi­den reaf­firmed the US com­mit­ment to de­fend South Korea, high­light­ing the Asian ally as a “lynch­pin of the se­cu­rity and pros­per­ity of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion”, Mr Moon’s spokesman Kang Min-seok said.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Moon asked for close co­op­er­a­tion for the for­ward-look­ing de­vel­op­ment of the bi­lat­eral al­liance, and de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion and peace on the Korean penin­sula,” Mr Kang told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had vowed to work to­wards de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion at their un­prece­dented sum­mit in 2018, but lit­tle progress has been made since their sec­ond sum­mit and work­ing-level talks col­lapsed last year.</p>
    <p>While Mr Bi­den has said he would not meet Mr Kim with­out pre­con­di­tions, he has also said he would em­brace “prin­ci­pled diplo­macy” with North Korea.</p>
    <p>South Korean of­fi­cials are also hope­ful that Mr Bi­den will quickly re­solve a drawn-out, multi-bil­lion-dol­lar dis­pute with Wash­ing­ton over the cost of thou­sands of US troops on the penin­sula.</p>
    <p>On cli­mate change, Mr Mor­ri­son said he spoke with Mr Bi­den about emis­sion re­duc­tion tech­nol­ogy, though a tar­get for zero net emis­sions by 2050 was not dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>“I raised with the Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Mr Ron Klain (above), a sea­soned Demo­cratic op­er­a­tive, was cho­sen as United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s chief of staff on Wed­nes­day. elect the sim­i­lar­ity be­tween the Pres­i­dent-elect’s com­ments and poli­cies re­gard­ing emis­sions re­duc­tion tech­nolo­gies that we needed to achieve that, and we look for­ward to work­ing on those is­sues,” Mr Mor­ri­son told re­porters in Can­berra.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Moon and Mr Suga said they agreed to ar­range sum­mits with the Pres­i­dent-elect shortly af­ter his inau­gu­ra­tion in Jan­uary.</p>
