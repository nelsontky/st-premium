    <p>In the past, events like this week’s Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit would have gath­ered par­tic­i­pants in a large venue. But due to Covid-19, the dis­cus­sions con­tinue vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing this yes­ter­day, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said the coron­avirus pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, and Sin­ga­pore is pi­o­neer­ing dif­fer­ent ways to carry on run­ning amid dis­rup­tions. “We are not plan­ning on wait­ing out for the Covid sit­u­a­tion to pass. Our pri­or­ity now is re­ally to learn to live in a Covid world while pre­par­ing for a post-Covid world.”</p>
    <p>He was part of a panel on the topic of dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity and cross-bor­der flows in a post-Covid world on the sum­mit’s last day.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said while the world was al­ready head­ing to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion be­fore Covid-19, the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated this pro­cess.</p>
    <p>One re­sult is the rapid adop­tion of work­ing re­motely that many com­pa­nies had to in­stil so their em­ploy­ees can remain dis­tanced and prevent the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter noted that with telecom­mut­ing be­com­ing a norm, peo­ple and com­pa­nies will soon un­der­stand that many white-col­lar jobs can be done over the In­ter­net from any­where in the world, mak­ing them more com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“White-col­lar jobs will no longer have the ge­o­graph­i­cal in­su­la­tion that they used to have, and it will be­come a much more com­pet­i­tive, and a much more con­nected, play­ing field across the en­tire world,” he said. “This is why even white-col­lar work­ers would re­quire life­long learn­ing in or­der for them to stay com­pet­i­tive and to have a job.”</p>
    <p>Also on the panel mod­er­ated by CNBC an­chor and cor­re­spon­dent Nancy Hunger­ford was ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of com­mod­ity trad­ing com­pany Trafigura Group Jeremy Weir.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has has­tened the adop­tion of some prac­tices in his com­pany that have made work more ef­fi­cient, like the use of com­mu­ni­ca­tion tools. “We had a lot of peo­ple trav­el­ling around the globe. But we are now util­is­ing the var­i­ous com­mu­ni­ca­tion sys­tems... which have re­ally im­proved ef­fi­cien­cies in our or­gan­i­sa­tion,” said Mr Weir.</p>
    <p>Fel­low pan­el­list Fleur Pel­lerin, who is the founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Korelya Cap­i­tal, said she was very im­pressed with the re­silience demon­strated by both big cor­po­ra­tions and smaller busi­nesses in deal­ing with Covid-19 dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies had to move to re­mote work al­most com­pletely and find ways to remain ef­fi­cient, even those that might never have thought they could do so.</p>
    <p>“When you have to, you just do it. Prob­a­bly some cor­po­ra­tions felt they were not very ag­ile. (But) when they had to move, they just moved. And they changed the way they see them­selves,” she added.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion from an au­di­ence mem­ber on the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber, where Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is up against for­mer vi­cepres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, Mr Chan said no mat­ter who wins, Sin­ga­pore will work with them to fur­ther ties.</p>
    <p>Rather than fo­cus on the per­son­al­i­ties, peo­ple should fo­cus on the driv­ing forces be­hind the US ad­min­is­tra­tion’s poli­cies, he added.</p>
    <p>“Whether it is a Trump pres­i­dency or a Bi­den pres­i­dency, the US has en­dur­ing in­ter­est in the peace and se­cu­rity and the eco­nomic pros­per­ity of South-east Asia and Asia,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“And the US will need to work with part­ners in this part of the world to se­cure its own in­ter­ests. I think that will not change.”</p>
