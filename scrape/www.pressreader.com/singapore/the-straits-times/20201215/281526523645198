    <p>See the zoo anew with an ex­pe­ri­enced guide and a fam­ily-friendly tour, says cor­re­spon­dent Ed­dino Ab­dul Hadi, who en­gaged a guide from lo­cal travel com­pany Xpe­ri­ence Singapore to take his fam­ily around the exhibits. The tour has given him new ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the park, he adds.</p>
    <p>Like many Sin­ga­pore­ans, I have fond mem­o­ries of go­ing to the Singapore Zoo as a child.</p>
    <p>I have also vis­ited sev­eral times in re­cent years and they have al­ways been free-and-easy af­fairs.</p>
    <p>I de­cided to ex­pe­ri­ence it a lit­tle dif­fer­ently this time by en­gag­ing a guide from lo­cal travel com­pany Xpe­ri­ence Singapore to take my fam­ily around the exhibits.</p>
    <p>And I can hap­pily say that the Zoo – De­clas­si­fied! tour has given me a new-found ap­pre­ci­a­tion for our beloved park.</p>
    <p>In a tour that lasted more than two hours, I learnt a lot more about the dif­fer­ent species and why their exhibits are built a cer­tain way, more than I would have from just read­ing the sign­boards.</p>
    <p>Our ex­pe­ri­enced guide could rat­tle off trivia and an­swer a bar­rage of ques­tions, mostly from my seven-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren are nat­u­rally in­quis­i­tive and I am glad there was an ex­pert to save me from hav­ing to Google the an­swers ev­ery few min­utes.</p>
    <p>We took the morn­ing tour, which started at 10am, and headed to the Treetrop Trails to look for Anna and Ako, a pair of tree-swing­ing sia­mangs or gib­bons.</p>
    <p>Our guide talked about the zoo’s open con­cept and free-rang­ing ar­eas, which al­low the animals to roam about in nat­u­ral sur­round­ings with­out be­ing con­fined to cages.</p>
    <p>At the free-rang­ing area for orang utans, it was quite a sight to see the pri­mates ma­noeu­vre the in­ter­con­nect­ing vines right above our heads.</p>
    <p>My seven-year-old asked what stops the animals from es­cap­ing if there are no cages to hold them in.</p>
    <p>Our guide ex­plained that the zoo uses sev­eral ways to keep animals in – for ex­am­ple, hav­ing a moat around animals that can­not swim.</p>
    <p>He added that, by giv­ing the animals enough food and water and shel­ter, they are con­tent to stay and not make a break for it.</p>
    <p>The zoo also gives the animals plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties to act on their nat­u­ral in­stincts.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the chee­tahs chase mech­a­nised rab­bits as a form of ex­er­cise, and meat for the big cats are hid­den in gunny sacks for them to tear into.</p>
    <p>We learnt that animals such as os­triches and ze­bras are placed to­gether to cre­ate “pos­i­tive stress” so they will not get bored. And male ba­boons some­times “steal” ba­bies from the fe­males just to be fa­therly.</p>
    <p>I had also won­dered about the white rhino. Judg­ing by the dirty brown tone of its hide, I found its name a bit of a stretch.</p>
    <p>But, as our guide ex­plained, the name comes from the Afrikaans word “weit”, re­fer­ring to their wide muz­zle, which some­how later be­came “white”.</p>
    <p>The zoo’s Frag­ile For­est zone, a biodome built as a trop­i­cal rain­for­est habi­tat, was a hit with the kids. My two daugh­ters could not re­sist the cute free-roam­ing animals, from mousedeer and eclec­tus par­rots to two-toed sloths and Malayan fly­ing foxes.</p>
    <p>The tour cov­ered about 70 per cent of the zoo. It ended at the Great Rift Val­ley of Ethiopia ex­hibit, where my fam­ily took a break. We later con­tin­ued on our own to look for the white tiger and hip­pos.</p>
    <p>The price of the tour ($35 for adults and $30 for chil­dren) does not in­clude ad­mis­sion to the zoo (from $31.20 for adults, $20.80 for chil­dren and $18 for se­nior cit­i­zens).</p>
    <p>But you can use Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers to off­set the costs of the tour and zoo ad­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The Zoo – De­clas­si­fied! tour is avail­able only on Mon­days this month be­cause of the large turnout due to the school hol­i­days. From next month, tours will be moved to the week­ends.</p>
    <p>The zoo also con­ducts its own tours, although some have been sus­pended. For now, only the Pri­vate Buggy Tour is avail­able (from $240 for up to five peo­ple), but it is fully booked un­til the end of this month.</p>
