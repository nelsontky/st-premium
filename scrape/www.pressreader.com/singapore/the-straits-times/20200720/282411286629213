    <p>LONDON • Bournemout­h’s fiveyear spell in the Premier League is al­most over after l os­ing 2-0 at home to Southamp­ton yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Cher­ries will go down, join­ing Nor­wich, should Wat­ford, who yes­ter­day fired man­ager Nigel Pear­son, avoid a home de­feat by Manch­ester City to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Even if the 16th-placed Hor­nets lose to Pep Guardi­ola’s play­ers, there is still a three-point gap be­tween them and Bournemout­h, on top of a four-goal dif­fer­ence, with</p>

    <p>The hosts had la­belled Southamp­ton’s visit their “big­gest game” as they aimed for the two-goal mar­gin of vic­tory that would lift them out of the bot­tom three.</p>
    <p>They started brightly and Lloyd Kelly fired just wide be­fore Cal­lum Wil­son headed waste­fully over.</p>
    <p>Josh King then saw a penalty ap­peal re­jected by the video as­sis­tant ref­eree after he was bun­dled over by Jack Stephens.</p>
    <p>Terms & Con­di­tions</p>
    <p>No side has kept fewer clean sheets in the Premier League this sea­son than Bournemout­h and they cracked again four minutes be­fore half-time.</p>
    <p>Danny Ings deftly evaded two de­fend­ers be­fore drilling a fine fin­ish into the corner for his 21st league goal of the sea­son, mov­ing past Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang (20) of Arse­nal to go sec­ond on the top scor­ers’ list, just two be­hind the leader, Le­ices­ter’s Jamie Vardy.</p>
    <p>Bournemout­h thought they had sal­vaged a point in stop­page time, but Sam Sur­ridge saw his dra­matic equaliser dis­al­lowed for off­side.</p>
    <p>Che Adams net­ted the vis­i­tors’ sec­ond goal with vir­tu­ally the last kick to leave Bournemout­h with nine de­feats and only one win from their last 12 league matches.</p>
    <p>Cher­ries goal­keeper Aaron Rams­dale was dis­con­so­late at full-time, telling BT Sport: “I’m dev­as­tated.</p>
    <p>“We threw ev­ery­thing at it. We now have to look at other teams to help us out.”</p>
