    <p>When there was a sud­den out­break of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions at a whole­sale mar­ket in Bei­jing last month, there were fears that China was about to face a sec­ond wave af­ter hav­ing suc­cess­fully con­tained its first.</p>
    <p>But that sec­ond wave soon abated as Bei­jing acted quickly with tar­geted lock­downs and other mea­sures. The city had some 330 cases linked to the Xin­fadi mar­ket out­break at the end of the month when daily cases fell to sin­gle dig­its.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, other coun­tries in the re­gion are fac­ing con­tin­ued spikes fol­low­ing a loos­en­ing of months-long shut­downs of vary­ing sever­ity to con­tain the virus.</p>
    <p>These new, per­sis­tent surges have led to the dam­ag­ing blan­ket lock­down that Mel­bourne has im­posed, and which Manila is con­tem­plat­ing. Ja­pan’s new do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign to re­vive the econ­omy has been crimped as the virus re­bound in cap­i­tal city Tokyo has forced it to be ex­cluded from the re­vival plan.</p>
    <p>The pro­tracted out­break in the re­gion is af­fect­ing eco­nomic growth, with many coun­tries there ex­pect­ing neg­a­tive growth in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>China, on the other hand, saw its econ­omy grow by a sur­pris­ing 3.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, and is likely to reg­is­ter a slight growth for the year. What the coun­try did right in man­ag­ing the virus could have valu­able lessons for oth­ers now bat­tling resur­gences.</p>
    <p>“China has not seen the kind of surges in other coun­tries mainly be­cause of its strat­egy of erring on the side of cau­tion. It has been de­ter­mined to nip the surge of cases in the bud by re­spond­ing swiftly once the first cases are iden­ti­fied,” said Pro­fes­sor Huang Yanzhong, se­nior fel­low for global health at the Amer­i­can think-tank Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures in the Bei­jing out­break in­cluded lock­downs of high-risk neigh­bour­hoods, ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing and quar­an­tines, and mass test­ing.</p>
    <p>When the first case at Xin­fadi was de­tected on June 11, Bei­jing swiftly closed the mar­ket, which houses some 8,000 stall­hold­ers and work­ers and is vis­ited by thou­sands more daily. It also sealed off neigh­bour­hoods near the mar­ket and oth­ers thought to be at risk – 41 of the city’s 7,000 neigh­bour­hoods in all.</p>
    <p>To trace res­i­dents who might have been in­fected ei­ther from go­ing to the mar­ket them­selves or be­ing in con­tact with some­one who had, the au­thor­i­ties used not only a health sur­veil­lance app but also vol­un­teers, com­mu­nity work­ers and gov­ern­ment per­son­nel to knock on doors, make phone calls or con­tact peo­ple on the mes­sag­ing app WeChat.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket vendors, pa­trons and their con­tacts were the first to be tested. But tests were also ex­panded to in­clude the vul­ner­a­ble or eas­ily in­fected, such as the el­derly, taxi driv­ers and those work­ing in other mar­kets. Fi­nally, the ring fence was widened to in­clude res­i­dents liv­ing in medi­u­mand high-risk ar­eas – such as where in­fected peo­ple lived – med­i­cal work­ers and ser­vice sec­tor work­ers. Some 2.3 mil­lion peo­ple were tested within a week.</p>
    <p>The same grad­u­ated ap­proach was taken to quar­an­tines, noted an ar­ti­cle by a group of Univer­sity of Glas­gow re­searchers in the cur­rent af­fairs web­site, The Con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>All close con­tacts of con­firmed cases were taken to cen­tralised iso­la­tion sites, while self-iso­la­tion was im­posed on res­i­dents in the 41 neigh­bour­hoods deemed at risk.</p>
    <p>The swift, tar­geted ac­tion in­volv­ing the key prin­ci­ples of trac­ing, test­ing and iso­lat­ing worked. By the end of last month, lo­cal cases were down to sin­gle dig­its and there was none from</p>
    <p>July 7.</p>
    <p>That there have been no ma­jor surges else­where in the coun­try also shows China’s ef­fec­tive con­trol of its first out­break and the care it took to re­open.</p>
    <p>As the virus be­gan to abate sig­nif­i­cantly from late Fe­bru­ary, the coun­try re­opened slowly, be­gin­ning with fac­to­ries. Some cities in re­open­ing en­cour­aged em­ploy­ers to send their work­ers for tests.</p>
    <p>Shops and res­tau­rants were next to re­open in March, with so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules. Cin­e­mas will re­open next week.</p>
    <p>Schools be­gan re­open­ing in April, with many cities re­quir­ing teach­ers and stu­dents to be tested be­fore they could go to school. At school, tem­per­a­tures were checked, masks were manda­tory and breaks stag­gered.</p>
    <p>Tests were made ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able to the public. Rules on masks were re­laxed in mid-May so they are not needed when peo­ple are ex­er­cis­ing out­doors or in well-ven­ti­lated places. They are still re­quired for hospi­tal vis­its and in crowded or en­closed spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Many cities also use a health sur­veil­lance app that shows an in­di­vid­ual’s health sta­tus, so that only when the code is green is one able to en­ter a shop or take a taxi, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries have their own ver­sions of trac­ing apps, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, South Korea and Aus­tralia. Not all have the ca­pac­ity to adopt all the mea­sures taken by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, how­ever.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, for ex­am­ple, early lock­downs bought it time to ex­pand test­ing ca­pac­ity and treat­ment fa­cil­i­ties. How­ever, its con­tact trac­ing and sup­pres­sion ca­pac­i­ties have not kept pace with spikes in cases as the coun­try re­opened eco­nom­i­cally, said the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s coun­try rep­re­sen­ta­tive Rabindra Abeyas­inghe.</p>
    <p>If con­tact trac­ing is un­likely, said Prof Huang, coun­tries should fo­cus on other mea­sures, such as mak­ing mask-wear­ing manda­tory.</p>
    <p>For China, the fo­cus now is on re­boot­ing its econ­omy while it con­tin­ues to keep a wary eye on the virus and stay ready to beat it down.</p>
    <p>NIP­PING SURGES IN THE BUD</p>
    <p>China has not seen the kind of surges in other coun­tries mainly be­cause of its strat­egy of erring on the side of cau­tion. It has been de­ter­mined to nip the surge of cases in the bud by re­spond­ing swiftly once the first cases are iden­ti­fied.</p>
