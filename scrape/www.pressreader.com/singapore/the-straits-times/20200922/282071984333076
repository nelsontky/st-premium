    <p>A do­mes­tic worker, who ad­mit­ted to a re­duced mur­der charge in April for killing her em­ployer, has had a change of heart and now wants to rely on psy­chi­atric ev­i­dence in the hope of avoid­ing life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the High Court al­lowed an ap­pli­ca­tion by Dary­ati, 28, for her mur­der con­vic­tion to be set aside, af­ter her lawyer told the court that she “wishes to be heard on a de­fence of di­min­ished re­spon­si­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>The case will now be sched­uled for the trial to re­sume where it left off.</p>
    <p>If the court ac­cepts that Dary­ati was suf­fer­ing from a men­tal con­di­tion that di­min­ished her re­spon­si­bil­ity for the killing, she will be fac­ing life im­pris­on­ment or jail of up to 20 years for cul­pa­ble homi­cide.</p>
    <p>The con­tents of the de­fence psy­chi­atric re­port have yet to be re­vealed in open court.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati’s lawyer, Mr Mo­hamed Muza­m­mil Mo­hamed, later told The Straits Times that his client felt that “life im­pris­on­ment is on the heavy side”.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian does not dis­pute that she had re­peat­edly slashed and stabbed Madam Seow Kim Choo at her Telok Ku­rau house on June 7, 2016.</p>
    <p>The at­tack left the 59-year-old vic­tim with more than 90 knife wounds.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati was orig­i­nally tried for mur­der un­der Sec­tion 300(a) of the Pe­nal Code, which car­ries the manda­tory death penalty.</p>
    <p>The trial was heard for 17 days be­tween April 23 last year and March 4 this year, and the pros­e­cu­tion has yet to close its case.</p>
    <p>On April 6, the pros­e­cu­tion re­duced the charge to mur­der un­der Sec­tion 300(c), which car­ries life im­pris­on­ment or the death sen­tence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, pros­e­cu­tors told the court that they would not be seek­ing the death penalty.</p>
    <p>The case was ad­journed for Mr Muza­m­mil to pre­pare a mit­i­ga­tion plea.</p>
    <p>The lawyer told ST that his client gave in­struc­tions to mount a di­min­ished re­spon­si­bil­ity de­fence while he was pre­par­ing her mit­i­ga­tion plea.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati faces a sec­ond charge of at­tempt­ing to mur­der Madam Seow’s hus­band, Mr Ong Thiam Soon, then 57. This charge has been stood down for now.</p>
