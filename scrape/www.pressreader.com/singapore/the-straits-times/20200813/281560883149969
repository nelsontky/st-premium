    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have cleared the decks for thou­sands of work­ers to restart work with­out their em­ploy­ers need­ing to ap­ply for ap­proval. The change ap­plies to jobs that re­quire rel­a­tively few work­ers and could help the con­struc­tion sec­tor find its feet more quickly af­ter all work­ers have been tested.</p>
    <p>In a ma­jor move to re­vive the con­struc­tion in­dus­try, the au­thor­i­ties have cleared the decks for thou­sands of work­ers to restart work with­out their em­ploy­ers need­ing to ap­ply for ap­provals.</p>
    <p>The change ap­plies to jobs that re­quire rel­a­tively few work­ers – such as lift main­te­nance and ren­o­va­tion work – and could help the con­struc­tion sec­tor find its feet more quickly af­ter all work­ers have been tested.</p>
    <p>It will al­low an ad­di­tional 40,000 or so work­ers to get back on the job, as long as they are free of the virus and live in Covid-19-cleared ac­com­mo­da­tions, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>Con­trac­tors must still ap­ply to the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA) to be­gin work at con­struc­tion sites and premises such as ready-mixed con­crete plants and sand ter­mi­nals, as these usu­ally in­volve more man­power.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Loo, the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Straits Con­struc­tion Sin­ga­pore, said of the move: “These are chal­leng­ing times so ev­ery lit­tle bit helps. It is a good way to kick-start the re­sump­tion of con­struc­tion work that has been stalling.”</p>
    <p>With much of the sec­tor’s work­force con­fined to dor­mi­to­ries in the past four months, and work slow­ing down, the con­struc­tion sec­tor con­tracted 59.3 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>The lat­est an­nounce­ment to re­vive it comes a day af­ter the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said that all dor­mi­to­ries, with the ex­cep­tion of 17 blocks in six pur­pose­built dor­mi­to­ries that serve as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties, have been cleared of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The BCA also re­moved a rule that al­lowed em­ploy­ers to restart work only af­ter they have re­housed work­ers in the same project at no more than 10 dif­fer­ent premises.</p>
    <p>The rule, which in­dus­try stake­hold­ers said has been a ma­jor chal­lenge for firms, aimed to re­duce the risk of in­fec­tion when work­ers from dif­fer­ent dorms in­ter­acted on sites, and min­imise the num­ber of dorms af­fected if a Covid-19 case sur­faced.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers can now be­gin work even if their work­ers are housed at more than 10 ad­dresses, but the BCA said they should still con­tinue re­duc­ing the num­ber of ac­com­mo­da­tion sites for their staff.</p>
    <p>It added: “Con­trac­tors should take into ac­count the larger num­ber of work­ers on site and en­force strict zon­ing of their work­force, and en­sure that work­ers re­sid­ing in dif­fer­ent ac­com­mo­da­tion or per­form­ing dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties do not in­ter­min­gle on site.”</p>
    <p>Au­dits and in­spec­tions will be stepped up to en­sure rules are be­ing fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the BCA, the MOM, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and other agen­cies are work­ing to re­or­gan­ise worker ac­com­mo­da­tion so that those in the same com­pany stay at the same ad­dress. This will in­volve re-hous­ing 160,000 work­ers in 43 dor­mi­to­ries by Sept 30.</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion sec­tor last year ac­counted for 4 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy. Af­ter it was bat­tered by the pan­demic, around 3,300 con­struc­tion site projects have al­ready been ap­proved to restart.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior econ­o­mist Chua Hak Bin felt, how­ever, that re­cov­ery in the sec­tor will likely be slow de­spite the re­lax­ation of rules, given the ap­provals re­quired for ma­jor con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>He said: “There re­mains a high risk that some con­struc­tion firms will not be able to sur­vive and cope with the higher costs from meet­ing these stricter con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>New mea­sures were also an­nounced yes­ter­day for dor­mi­tory res­i­dents to en­joy their rest days. The MOM will start tri­als this month for res­i­dents from se­lected dor­mi­to­ries to visit recre­ation cen­tres on rest days to run er­rands such as buy­ing gro­ceries and re­mit­ting money.</p>
    <p>The BCA, the MOM, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and other agen­cies are work­ing to re­or­gan­ise worker ac­com­mo­da­tion so that those in the same com­pany stay at the same ad­dress. This will in­volve re-hous­ing 160,000 work­ers in 43 dor­mi­to­ries by Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Builders like Kori Hold­ings heaved a huge sigh of re­lief yes­ter­day at the lift­ing of a rule that had made restart­ing work on a project more cum­ber­some.</p>
    <p>With the change, Kori – a multi­na­tional Sin­ga­pore-based con­struc­tion com­pany – can de­ploy up to 80 per cent of its 200 work­ers with­out hav­ing to worry where they are be­ing housed.</p>
    <p>This is a ma­jor i mprove­ment from the 30 per cent un­der the pre­vi­ous rule, which re­quired con­trac­tors to house work­ers for the same project at no more than 10 dif­fer­ent premises.</p>
    <p>Said Kori chief ex­ec­u­tive Hooi Yu Koh: “For the first time in months, I feel cau­tiously op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>“We were strug­gling so this is a very sig­nif­i­cant fine-tun­ing of the rules. Most of my work­ers are ea­ger to re­turn to work as they can earn more money, and now I can re­de­ploy them.”</p>
    <p>Kori’s busi­ness has been hit hard by the stop-work or­ders at con­struc­tion sites to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter the two-month cir­cuit breaker ended on June 2, builders faced a slew of rules on phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and min­gling of work­ers.</p>
    <p>The lat­est eas­ing of the rules ef­fec­tively re­moves one layer of checks, said Mr Hooi, 49.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore this, we needed ap­proval for the work­ers, the sites and the match­ing of work­ers to spe­cific sites. Now, we need only ap­proval for the work­ers and sites.”</p>
    <p>In­dus­try stake­hold­ers said this par­tic­u­lar re­stric­tion had been a stick­ing point for con­struc­tion com­pa­nies and many had been lob­by­ing the au­thor­i­ties to ease up on it.</p>
    <p>The rule had been tweaked a few times be­fore it was com­pletely re­moved yes­ter­day. Ini­tially, the rule re­quired work­ers on a project to be housed in no more than five dif­fer­ent premises.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Loo, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Straits Con­struc­tion Sin­ga­pore, said that at one point, he moved all his work­ers into a ho­tel to ful­fil the ac­com­mo­da­tion rule.</p>
    <p>It was near the end of a project and his com­pany had to fork out the un­ex­pected cost.</p>
    <p>Given the ex­pe­ri­ence, the 55-year-old said he un­der­stood how im­por­tant the seem­ingly small tweak to the rules can be.</p>
    <p>“These are chal­leng­ing times so ev­ery lit­tle bit helps. It is a good way to kick-start the re­sump­tion of con­struc­tion work,” he added.</p>
    <p>As the for­mer pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Con­trac­tors As­so­ci­a­tion, he said he had re­ceived plenty of feed­back on the rule.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he also praised the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity’s de­ci­sion to al­low all small­er­scale projects that em­ploy a rel­a­tively lim­ited num­ber of work­ers, such as lift main­te­nance and ren­o­va­tion work, to restart.</p>
    <p>But chal­lenges con­tinue to loom for the con­struc­tion sec­tor, which con­trib­uted $17.8 bil­lion to Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy last year, mak­ing up 4 per cent of the coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the in­creased costs that com­pa­nies may have to bear ow­ing to slower work pro­cesses and stag­gered trans­port ar­range­ments for work­ers, some work­ers are also ask­ing to re­turn home af­ter nearly four months of re­stricted move­ments.</p>
    <p>A sig­nif­i­cant mi­nor­ity – about 5 per cent of Kori’s work­ers – no longer want to work here as they are home­sick, Mr Hooi said.</p>
    <p>The manda­tory swab tests work­ers have to com­plete ev­ery 14 days could also be un­fea­si­ble as more work­ers re­turn on site.</p>
    <p>“Al­ready, I’m see­ing on the por­tal that some of the book­ing slots are full (but) I’m mind­ful of how dif­fi­cult it is and I know how im­por­tant it is for the com­mu­nity,” he added.</p>
