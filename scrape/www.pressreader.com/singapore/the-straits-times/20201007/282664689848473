    <p>STOCK­HOLM • This year’s Nobel Lit­er­a­ture Prize field is wide open ahead of to­mor­row’s an­nounce­ment, with lit­er­ary cir­cles abuzz about whether the nod will go to a con­tro­ver­sial pick or a crowd­pleaser.</p>
    <p>Names tossed about i n the spec­u­la­tion in­clude CaribbeanA­mer­i­can au­thor Ja­maica Kin­caid, Cana­dian poet Anne Car­son, Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Hun­gary’s Peter Nadas and Amer­i­can novelist Thomas Pyn­chon.</p>
    <p>The Swedish Academy’s de­ci­sion to hon­our Aus­trian novelist Peter Handke last year un­leashed a flood of crit­i­cism, leav­ing many won­der­ing how it could crown a writer known for sup­port­ing Ser­bian leader Slo­bo­dan Milo­se­vic in the Balkan wars and deny­ing the ex­tent of Ser­bian ter­ror.</p>
    <p>But the 18-mem­ber Academy, which de­fended its choice as one based solely on lit­er­ary merit, is no stranger to con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>Its eye­brow-rais­ing pick of Amer­i­can rock legend Bob Dylan in 2016 was fol­lowed by a rape scan­dal close to its mem­bers that erupted in 2017 and tore the Academy apart, forc­ing it to post­pone the 2018 prize for the first time in 70 years.</p>
    <p>The Academy was re­vamped and its Nobel com­mit­tee was re­quired by the Nobel Foun­da­tion, which</p>
    <p>man­ages the prizes, to take in five ex­ter­nal ex­perts to help vet can­di­dates for the lit­er­a­ture prize de­lib­er­a­tions last year, as well as this year.</p>
    <p>But two ex­ter­nal ex­perts quit af­ter last year’s prize an­nounce­ments, lament­ing that their views were not taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>WHAT WOULD AL­FRED NOBEL SAY?</p>
    <p>Mr Bjorn Wi­man, cul­ture editor of Swe­den’s big­gest daily Da­gens Ny­heter, called the choice of Handke</p>
    <p>“ter­ri­bly bad”, adding: “If the Academy knows what is good for them, they’ll choose Ja­maica Kin­caid (this year).”</p>
    <p>Kin­caid writes about t hemes such as colo­nial­ism, racism and gen­der, and “her stances on var­i­ous moral and po­lit­i­cal is­sues are ab­so­lutely worth lis­ten­ing to to­day”, Mr Wi­man told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>He added that she “is ex­actly the type of per­son that takes the prize in the ide­al­is­tic di­rec­tion that prize founder Al­fred Nobel spoke of” in his will cre­at­ing the prizes.</p>
    <p>But, he said, if last year’s choice is any­thing to go by, the Academy may also “dust off some old can­di­date” from years ago, as it did with Handke.</p>
    <p>If that proves to be the case, authors such as Nadas, Al­ba­nia’s Is­mael Kadare and Ro­ma­nia’s Mircea Cartarescu could re­ceive the nod.</p>
    <p>Ms Made­laine Levy, lit­er­a­ture critic at daily Sven­ska Dag­bladet, agreed Kin­caid could be a po­ten­tial win­ner, call­ing her an “un­be­liev­ably mu­si­cal writer who’s easy to love”.</p>
    <p>But an Academy that chose Handke could be more in­clined to go with some­one like France’s Michel Houelle­becq, she sug­gested.</p>
    <p>“He’s the same type of writer, with a gloomy view of con­tem­po­rary Europe and a very neg­a­tive view of mankind, where man is such a fail­ure... and from that, cre­ate great lit­er­a­ture about man’s weak­ness and ug­li­ness.”</p>
    <p>Ms Levy’s choice is Amer­i­can au­thor Joan Did­ion, who “started a type of so­ci­etal but very po­lit­i­cally in­ter­ested and pop cul­ture-in­ter­ested es­say style that is very lively to­day”.</p>
    <p>Anne Car­son is seen as a hot tip this year, as well as the “usual sus­pects” Joyce Carol Oates and Mar­i­lynne Robin­son of the United States, Is­rael’s David Gross­man, Canada’s Mar­garet At­wood and South Korean poet Ko Un.</p>
    <p>For­mer editor Svante Weyler said Bri­tish writer Hi­lary Man­tel – not usu­ally men­tioned in Nobel cir­cles – could also win “for com­bin­ing an ex­tremely sharp in­tel­lec­tual de­pic­tion with a very pub­lic ap­peal”.</p>
    <p>“(Man­tel) has not only made the his­tor­i­cal novel ac­cept­able, she has made it the lead­ing genre in world lit­er­a­ture,” Mr Weyler said.</p>
    <p>But the Academy of­ten shuns best-sell­ing main­stream authors, opt­ing to shine its spot­light on lesser-known names.</p>
    <p>“If you’re sit­ting on all this prize money to award, and you have all this at­ten­tion that you can be­stow, then of course you might think... it’s more fun to give it to some­one who’s not al­ready in the lime­light,” Ms Levy said.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, she added, “al­most all coun­tries have some un­be­liev­ably strong writ­ers wor­thy of a Nobel prize. The list of writ­ers who are so in­cred­i­bly good that they are at Nobel prize level is long – sev­eral hun­dred, I would say”.</p>
    <p>“The Academy has sur­prised ev­ery­one many, many times. They work i n mys­te­ri­ous ways,” she con­cluded.</p>
