    <p>UNITED STATES • One morn­ing a few weeks ago, Alex Tre­bek woke up in agony, strug­gling to move.</p>
    <p>He had barely slept dur­ing the night, but he dragged him­self out of bed and got dressed for work.</p>
    <p>A small pro­duc­tion crew had set up a stu­dio in his Los An­ge­les home so he could tape in­tro­duc­tions to old episodes of Jeop­ardy!, the quiz show he has hosted for more than three decades. He had not recorded a new show since the pan­demic halted pro­duc­tion in March.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally, Tre­bek hosts five episodes a day, two days a week, from July to April – so there was new ma­te­rial to air through the first three months of the shut­down. Now that the stock­pile had run out, pro­duc­ers de­cided to res­ur­rect pop­u­lar episodes from years past.</p>
    <p>As he climbed the stairs, he had to stop to rest. Then he got in front of the cam­era and some­thing shifted.</p>
    <p>“Oddly enough, when we started tap­ing, I sud­denly started to re­gain my strength,” he said in a tele­phone in­ter­view a cou­ple of days later. “It’s the strangest thing. It is some kind of an elixir.”</p>
    <p>For the next hour and a half, Tre­bek nar­rated in­tro­duc­tions for 20 episodes, in­clud­ing the first game of Jeop­ardy! he hosted, from 1984.</p>
    <p>He also taped pro­mo­tional videos and recorded a health up­date for fans who have been fol­low­ing his strug­gle with ad­vanced pan­cre­atic can­cer.</p>
    <p>Tre­bek, who turns 80 this month, has never been one to ig­nore hard facts. He plans to keep mak­ing the show for as long as he can, but he wor­ries that his per­for­mance is de­clin­ing, that he is slur­ring his words and mess­ing up clues.</p>
    <p>“It’s a qual­ity pro­gramme and I think I do a good job host­ing it, and when I start slip­ping, I’ll stop host­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>In an en­ter­tain­ment and me­dia ecosys­tem that of­ten feels ephemeral, va­pid and di­vorced from re­al­ity, Tre­bek rep­re­sents some­thing time­less.</p>
    <p>With his cere­bral bear­ing and aura of quiet, im­par­tial au­thor­ity, he em­bod­ies ideals that feel en­dan­gered: the pur­suit of knowl­edge and the in­her­ent value of facts.</p>
    <p>He is a game-show host and a smooth-talk­ing, quick-wit­ted en­ter­tainer, but he is also, in a way, an ar­biter of truth.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a show about good and evil, but it’s a show about right and wrong, and the brac­ing cer­tainty that he ex­presses is so rare in our mud­dled lives,” said New Yorker staff writer and CNN an­a­lyst Jef­frey Toobin, a long-time Jeop­ardy! fan and a five-time clue on the show.</p>
    <p>It both­ers Tre­bek that facts no longer pro­vide com­mon ground; that a shared nar­ra­tive about cur­rent events has frac­tured into ide­o­log­i­cal me­dia bub­bles, in which in­for­ma­tion has given way to hy­per­bole and re­flex­ive opin­ion.</p>
    <p>“There’s a cer­tain com­fort that comes from know­ing a fact,” he said. “The sun is up in the sky. There’s noth­ing you can say that’s go­ing to change that. You can’t say, ‘The sun’s not up there, there’s no sky.’ There is re­al­ity, and there’s noth­ing wrong with ac­cept­ing re­al­ity. It’s when you try to dis­tort re­al­ity, to ma­noeu­vre it into ac­com­mo­dat­ing your par­tic­u­lar point of view, your par­tic­u­lar big­otry, your par­tic­u­lar what­ever – that’s when you run into prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>Since March, he has been quar­an­tined with his wife, Jean. He has oc­cu­pied him­self with projects around the house, sewing a new seat cover for an out­door swing and fix­ing the me­chan­i­cal cover on their swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>He has also kept busy by writ­ing his mem­oir, The An­swer Is...: Re­flec­tions On My Life, which Si­mon & Schus­ter re­leased on Tues­day, a day be­fore his birth­day.</p>
    <p>There are no shock­ing rev­e­la­tions in his mem­oir, but there are a few sur­prises. Tre­bek swears, a lot. He was so un­ruly as a boy that he al­most got ex­pelled from board­ing school. He has a half-brother he did not know about un­til he was in his 40s. His favourite an­i­mal is the musk ox. His favourite drink is low-fat milk or, if he is feel­ing frisky, chardon­nay.</p>
    <p>Even in to­day’s frag­mented me­dia land­scape, Jeop­ardy! con­tin­ues to have broad ap­peal, pulling in an av­er­age weekly au­di­ence of 24 mil­lion view­ers.</p>
    <p>Over the course of his ca­reer, Tre­bek has survived a car crash, two heart at­tacks and brain surgery for blood clots. But the show’s pro­duc­ers and writ­ers were stunned when he told them he had pan­cre­atic can­cer.</p>
    <p>“It was a gut punch,” said Mr Harry Fried­man, who be­gan pro­duc­ing Jeop­ardy! around 20 years ago and re­tired this year. “He had re­ally not been feel­ing great, but in typ­i­cal Alex fash­ion, he wasn’t com­plain­ing about it.”</p>
    <p>One morn­ing last year, early in the course of his treat­ment, Tre­bek felt so sick that he lay down on the floor of his dress­ing room, sob­bing from the pain.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­ers sug­gested can­celling the rest of the day’s tap­ings, but he in­sisted on host­ing all five episodes.</p>
    <p>When he walked onto the stage and greeted the au­di­ence, he felt fo­cused, like him­self.</p>
    <p>“Once I in­tro­duce him on that stage, he is Alex Tre­bek,” said long­time Jeop­ardy! an­nouncer Johnny Gilbert. “You can tell that’s what he’s liv­ing for.”</p>
