    <p>NEW YORK • Ann Reink­ing, a dancer, ac­tor and Tony Award­win­ning chore­og­ra­pher who per­formed for nearly three decades on Broad­way, where she was known for her long as­so­ci­a­tion with Bob Fosse and his work, died last Satur­day in Wood­inville, Washington, near Seat­tle. She was 71.</p>
    <p>Reink­ing had been vis­it­ing her elder brother when she died in her sleep in a ho­tel room, said her sis­ter-in-law Dahrla King. The cause was not yet known.</p>
    <p>As a per­former, Reink­ing was per­haps best known for play­ing Roxie Hart in the hit John Kan­derFred Ebb mu­si­cal, Chicago. She stepped into the role in 1977, at 27, and it helped make her a star.</p>
    <p>In 1996, when she was in her 40s, she re­turned to the role tri­umphantly for a hugely suc­cess­ful Broad­way re­vival, which she also chore­ographed.</p>
    <p>Her suc­cess on­stage in the orig­i­nal pro­duc­tion fas­ci­nated au­di­ences in part be­cause of a ro­man­tic sub­plot play­ing out off­stage.</p>
    <p>When Reink­ing, an in­genue, took on the role of Roxie, she was ro­man­ti­cally in­volved with Fosse, the show’s di­rec­tor and chore­og­ra­pher.</p>
    <p>And the star she was re­plac­ing was Gwen Ver­don, who had been mar­ried to Fosse and had sep­a­rated from him sev­eral years ear­lier.</p>
    <p>By the time Reink­ing re­turned to the role two decades later, she had be­come a for­mi­da­ble chore­og­ra­pher her­self. She won the Tony Award for Best Chore­og­ra­phy for the Chicago re­vival, which con­tin­ued its run into this year.</p>
    <p>She imag­ined her dance move­ments as an up­dated tribute to Fosse’s ear­lier chore­og­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>Fosse died of a heart at­tack in 1987, aged 60.</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ued to keep the Fosse flame burn­ing i n 1999 by codi­rect­ing and co-chore­ograph­ing the Broad­way mu­si­cal Fosse, a re­vue of his work, which won the Tony for Best Mu­si­cal.</p>
    <p>“He lived to wake peo­ple up, to make them re­ally live,” she said of Fosse in 1996. “He taught me how hard you have to work to do that.”</p>
    <p>Reink­ing de­scribed Fosse’s work as hav­ing “in­flu­enced a gen­er­a­tion”, but she said her chore­o­graphic style was dif­fer­ent – more bal­letic and quirky.</p>
    <p>In 1979, she played a char­ac­ter based on her­self in Fosse’s fan­ta­sy­filled but frankly au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal film, All That Jazz, with Roy</p>
    <p>Schei­der as an in­tense Fosse-like di­rec­tor and chore­og­ra­pher.</p>
    <p>“It was me and it wasn’t me,” she said of her char­ac­ter, the di­rec­tor’s girl­friend, in an in­ter­view with The Times in 1980.</p>
    <p>“Ba­si­cally, I was very flat­tered. I think I came off as a good per­son and as some­one who meant some­thing to him.”</p>
    <p>Reink­ing was born on Nov 10, 1949, in Seat­tle to Wal­ter and Frances Reink­ing. Her fa­ther was a hy­draulics en­gi­neer and sales­man, her mother was a house­wife.</p>
    <p>She started ballet classes when she was eight, her mother told The Seat­tle Times.</p>
    <p>She was a teenager when she ap­peared in her first pro­fes­sional show, Bye Bye Birdie, at the Seat­tle Opera House, in 1965.</p>
    <p>Ann Reink­ing stud­ied at the San Fran­cisco Ballet School as a schol­ar­ship stu­dent and, af­ter grad­u­at­ing from high school, at­tended a Jof­frey Ballet sum­mer res­i­dency in Ta­coma, Washington.</p>
    <p>There, by her mother’s ac­count, Mr Robert Jof­frey, co-founder of the com­pany, urged her to go to New York, telling her that her tal­ent ex­tended be­yond dance to singing and act­ing.</p>
    <p>In New York, Reink­ing was a mem­ber of the corps de ballet at Ra­dio City Mu­sic Hall.</p>
    <p>Her first Broad­way role was in the en­sem­ble of Cabaret in 1969. She went on to ap­pear in Coco, which starred Katharine Hep­burn as Coco Chanel, and Pip­pin, which Fosse chore­ographed.</p>
    <p>Reink­ing starred as Joan of Arc, op­po­site Joel Grey, in the short-lived 1975 mu­si­cal Good­time Charley. The next year, she joined the cast of the smash hit A Cho­rus Line, then went on to ap­pear in Dancin’, a mu­si­cal re­vue di­rected and chore­ographed by Fosse, start­ing in 1978.</p>
    <p>In 1986, Reink­ing starred in a re­vival of Sweet Char­ity, a pro­duc­tion that also fea­tured Bebe Neuwirth, who went on to per­form op­po­site Reink­ing as Velma Kelly in the Chicago re­vival.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Chicago re­vival, Reink­ing, by then in her 40s, had never ex­pected to dance on­stage again, she said.</p>
    <p>In­deed, at first she turned down the of­fer to play Roxie again. But di­rec­tor Wal­ter Bob­bie per­sisted and she re­lented.</p>
    <p>“She sim­ply doesn’t dance like any­one else,” Neuwirth told The Times in 1996.</p>
    <p>Reink­ing later found roles on the screen as well, no­tably as bil­lion­aire Oliver War­bucks’ sec­re­tary, Grace Far­rell, in the 1982 movie ver­sion of the hit mu­si­cal Annie.</p>
    <p>Reink­ing was mar­ried four times, in­clud­ing briefly when she was 21, and had a six-year re­la­tion­ship with Fosse.</p>
    <p>She and her most re­cent hus­band, sports writer Peter Tal­bert, were mar­ried in 1994.</p>
    <p>He sur­vives her, along with her son, Christo­pher, and six sib­lings – Richard, Robert, James, Jef­frey, He­len and Daniel.</p>
