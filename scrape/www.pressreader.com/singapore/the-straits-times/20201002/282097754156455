    <p>The High Court of Malaysia has thrown out a law­suit filed by the coun­try’s rights group Lawyers for Lib­erty (LFL) against Sin­ga­pore’s Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>The law­suit was filed by the non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) on Jan 24 this year, in re­sponse to a Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act (Pofma) di­rec­tion is­sued to it on Jan 22.</p>
    <p>At the time, the di­rec­tion had re­quired the NGO to in­sert a cor­rec­tion no­tice on top of an ar­ti­cle pub­lished on its web­site, which the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) said con­tained “un­true, base­less and pre­pos­ter­ous al­le­ga­tions about ju­di­cial ex­e­cu­tions con­ducted in Changi Pri­son”.</p>
    <p>As the LFL had not served its court pa­pers on Mr Shan­mugam, and dis­con­tin­ued its ap­pli­ca­tions to re­new the pa­pers due to rea­sons that the out­fit did not make known, the Malaysian High Court on Sept 21 struck out the law­suit.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the MHA called the LFL’s le­gal ac­tion “base­less”. “The LFL’s con­duct in com­menc­ing its le­gal ac­tion, pub­li­cis­ing the same, and then fail­ing to pros­e­cute the mat­ter, lead­ing to its strik­ing out by the High Court of Malaysia, is con­sis­tent with how LFL has con­ducted it­self so far,” said the MHA.</p>
    <p>“LFL made sen­sa­tional al­le­ga­tions against the Sin­ga­pore Pri­son Ser­vice, and the treat­ment of pris­on­ers, and promised to put for­ward ev­i­dence. But noth­ing was put for­ward to sub­stan­ti­ate its wild and com­pletely un­true al­le­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>The LFL had claimed in a state­ment on Jan 16 that Sin­ga­pore pri­son of­fi­cers were in­structed to kick the back of a prisoner’s neck with great force to break it, if the rope breaks dur­ing a hang­ing.</p>
    <p>The Pofma of­fice also is­sued cor­rec­tion di­rec­tions to three par­ties that shared the al­le­ga­tions – Sin­ga­porean ac­tivist Kirsten Han, The On­line Cit­i­zen web­site and Ya­hoo Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times con­tacted LFL for com­ment but did not re­ceive a re­ply as of press time.</p>
