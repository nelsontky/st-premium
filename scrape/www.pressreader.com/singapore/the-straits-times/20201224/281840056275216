    <p>• Cana­dian Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau’s gov­ern­ment has re­jected a plan by China’s Shan­dong Gold Min­ing to ac­quire a gold miner that op­er­ates in the Cana­dian Arc­tic, po­ten­tially in­flam­ing a diplo­matic feud.</p>
    <p>TMAC Re­sources owns the Hope Bay gold mine in the north­ern ter­ri­tory of Nu­navut, an op­er­a­tion that in­cludes a port and air strips.</p>
    <p>Shan­dong, an ac­quis­i­tive state­backed metal pro­ducer, agreed to buy the Toronto-based firm for about US$150 mil­lion (S$200 mil­lion) in May.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, TMAC re­ceived no­tice the gov­ern­ment had or­dered a na­tional se­cu­rity re­view.</p>
    <p>The Cana­dian miner said on Mon­day that an or­der had been is­sued un­der the In­vest­ment Canada Act for Shan­dong not to pro­ceed with the takeover.</p>
    <p>Shan­dong con­firmed the re­jec­tion on Tues­day, cit­ing a de­ci­sion made for the “pur­pose of safe­guard­ing na­tional se­cu­rity”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Mr Trudeau’s of­fice de­clined to com­ment on the move, which comes amid frayed ties between Canada and China over the 2018 ar­rest of a top Huawei Tech­nolo­gies ex­ec­u­tive on a United States ex­tra­di­tion re­quest.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian yes­ter­day said Canada “should pro­vide an open and non-dis­crim­i­na­tory busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment for all com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing in Canada, in­clud­ing the Chi­nese ones”.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese em­bassy in Ot­tawa sees any politi­ci­sa­tion of eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion as wrong, a spokesman said, call­ing on the Cana­dian gov­ern­ment to foster a fair mar­ket for all for­eign in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian in­dus­try min­istry spokesman So­phy Lam­bertRacine said she was re­stricted in ex­plain­ing why the Shan­dong deal was re­jected, cit­ing con­fi­den­tial­ity pro­vi­sions of the In­vest­ment Act.</p>
    <p>“Canada re­mains open to in­vest­ments that cre­ate jobs, growth, ac­cess to global trade and value chains, and long-term pros­per­ity for Cana­di­ans, while pro­tect­ing na­tional se­cu­rity in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>TMAC plunged as much as 19 per cent, the most i ntra­day since March, in Toronto.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity ob­servers have said a sale could be a threat to Canada be­cause it would give China greater ac­cess to the North-west Pas­sage and is close to Cana­dian early warn­ing radar fa­cil­i­ties in the Arc­tic.</p>
    <p>The Trudeau gov­ern­ment’s re­jec­tion of the deal might not be the end of the story, said Pro­fes­sor Stephanie Carvin at Car­leton Univer­sity in Ot­tawa, a for­mer gov­ern­ment in­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>She said: “The is­sue when deal­ing with state-owned and stat­e­cham­pi­oned en­ter­prises is that when you say no to them, China finds other ways to cir­cum­vent the rule of law.”</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion – and Bei­jing’s re­ac­tion to it – will be watched closely by other Arc­tic na­tions, Prof Carvin said, not­ing that Cana­dian For­eign Min­is­ter Fran­cois-Philippe Cham­pagne had meet­ings with his Nordic coun­ter­parts re­cently.</p>
    <p>“Canada is not the only coun­try strug­gling to deal with China in the north. Den­mark is par­tic­u­larly con­cerned,” she said, cit­ing Bei­jing’s in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments in Green­land.</p>
    <p>Canada-China re­la­tions soured sharply two years ago, when the po­lice de­tained Huawei chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Meng Wanzhou in Van­cou­ver.</p>
    <p>She has been con­fined there since then, fight­ing ex­tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>In the days af­ter her ar­rest, China jailed two Cana­di­ans on es­pi­onage charges and halted bil­lions of dol­lars in agri­cul­tural im­ports.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the Huawei case flared, China was warn­ing of an in­vest­ment chill in Canada af­ter Mr Trudeau’s gov­ern­ment re­jected a takeover of Toronto-based con­struc­tion giant Ae­con Group, cit­ing na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
