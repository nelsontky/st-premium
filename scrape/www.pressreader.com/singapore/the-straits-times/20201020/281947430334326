    <p>There are two schools of thought about the mar­ket im­pact of Big</p>
    <p>Data and artificial in­tel­li­gence (AI), although, para­dox­i­cally, both may be si­mul­ta­ne­ously true.</p>
    <p>The first says that only the big­gest tech com­pa­nies know how to swim in the deep end of AI. To build state-of-the-art mod­els re­quires mas­sive amounts of data, com­pu­ta­tional power, ex­per­tise and cap­i­tal. Only the likes of Google and Mi­crosoft in the US and Alibaba and Ten­cent in China can ever hope to make a splash.</p>
    <p>The se­cond ar­gues that AI, like al­most ev­ery other mod­ern tech­nol­ogy, will even­tu­ally be­come “democra­tised”. The tech com­pa­nies are them­selves em­pow­er­ing oth­ers to ac­cess pow­er­ful AI tools, such as Face­book’s PyTorch and Google’s Ten­sorFlow, and cloud com­put­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers are be­com­ing bet­ter at build­ing smarter mod­els with less data. Tra­di­tional com­pa­nies with spe­cific in­dus­try ex­per­tise and in­no­va­tive start-ups with en­tre­pre­neur­ial vim can also dive into the AI pool.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers in the United States and Europe have been spend­ing a lot of time re­cently think­ing about how to break the grip of Big Tech. That may in­deed be nec­es­sary to cre­ate a freer mar­ket­place. But they should also be spend­ing more time think­ing about how to open up ac­cess to data and AI to en­cour­age a broader range of com­peti­tors to emerge.</p>
    <p>One in­trigu­ing way to do just that is be­ing cham­pi­oned by the Stan­ford In­sti­tute for Hu­man-Cen­tred Artificial In­tel­li­gence, led by Pro­fes­sor John Etchemendy and Dr Fei-Fei Li. Their idea is to build a na­tional re­search cloud, a three-way col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween fed­eral gov­ern­ment, pri­vate en­ter­prise and re­search uni­ver­si­ties, to pro­vide af­ford­able ac­cess to pow­er­ful com­pu­ta­tional re­sources and pub­lic data sets in a se­cure cloud en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The aim of the re­search cloud is to en­able more aca­demic and in­dus­try re­searchers to work at the lead­ing edge of AI, help train a new gen­er­a­tion of ex­perts in the most so­phis­ti­cated tech­niques and – with luck – de­liver break­throughs in highly com­plex ar­eas, such as cli­mate change and health­care.</p>
    <p>Prof Etchemendy says that some cut­ting-edge AI re­search is cur­rently in­ac­ces­si­ble to uni­ver­si­ties be­cause of the cost. He points to the ex­am­ple of GPT-3, the deep learn­ing lan­guage pre­dic­tion model de­vel­oped by the Mi­crosoft-backed Open AI re­search com­pany, which ma­chine-reads all text ac­ces­si­ble on the Web, at an es­ti­mated cost of US$12 mil­lion (S$16.3 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Re­mark­ably, given the cur­rent po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment, Stan­ford’s pub­lic cloud ini­tia­tive has won bi­par­ti­san sup­port in both houses of Congress and is likely to be added to the Na­tional De­fence Au­tho­ri­sa­tion Act af­ter next month’s election.</p>
    <p>This would au­tho­rise a task force to come up with spe­cific pro­pos­als to de­velop the re­search cloud, which has also been backed by 22 uni­ver­si­ties and sev­eral com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment would then in­ject pub­lic data sets and sub­sidise re­searchers to ac­cess the cloud, lay­ered on top of ex­ist­ing in­dus­try in­fra­struc­ture. “I can see this be­ing funded at any­where from US$1 bil­lion to US$10 bil­lion a year,” says Prof Etchemendy. “This will ben­e­fit the US and democra­tise the tech­nol­ogy, whether for in­dus­try or academia.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries and com­pa­nies are at­tempt­ing to de­velop their own cloud com­put­ing in­fra­struc­ture, known as Gaia-X, to re­duce their de­pen­dence on the pow­er­ful US tech groups.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union’s draft Dig­i­tal Ser­vices Act also en­vis­ages forc­ing the big US com­pa­nies to share some of their data.</p>
    <p>But Dr Willem Jonker, chief ex­ec­u­tive of EIT Dig­i­tal, an in­no­va­tion in­sti­tute, says too much of Europe’s pol­icy is geared to­wards the tran­si­tion of es­tab­lished com­pa­nies rather than the cre­ation of new ones.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle point in cre­at­ing a level play­ing field in Europe if that field is still dom­i­nated by big US tech com­pa­nies. “Europe has to cre­ate the mak­ers,” he says. “Dig­i­tal sovereignt­y is about hav­ing a choice.”</p>
    <p>A pub­lic re­search cloud could be a great way to stim­u­late such in­no­va­tion. The US pro­posal is such a good one that Europe should build some­thing sim­i­lar it­self.</p>
