    <p>VENICE • Imag­ine be­ing shut in at home, with only the dog to talk to, wait­ing for some­thing to hap­pen and get­ting closer and closer to break­ing point.</p>
    <p>That might sound like a fa­mil­iar sce­nario af­ter the past few months of lock­downs around the world, but it is also the premise for Span­ish di­rec­tor Pedro Almod­ovar’s new short film, The Hu­man Voice, star­ring Tilda Swin­ton, which pre­miered at the Venice Film Fes­ti­val in Italy last week.</p>
    <p>Based loosely on a one-wo­man play by French writer Jean Cocteau, the 30-minute film was shot over nine days in Madrid in July.</p>
    <p>In it, Swin­ton waits in her apart­ment for a call from her lover to ne­go­ti­ate the end of their re­la­tion­ship, pop­ping pills and lay­ing out el­e­gant out­fits on the bed.</p>
    <p>When he does fi­nally call, she puts in Ap­ple AirPods, rather than lift­ing a tele­phone as ac­tresses usu­ally do when per­form­ing Cocteau’s play.</p>
    <p>The project had been planned be­fore the coro­n­avirus lock­downs hit in March, but shoot­ing dur­ing the pan­demic has given The Hu­man Voice a spe­cial res­o­nance: Swin­ton called it “the ul­ti­mate lock­down film”.</p>
    <p>In a so­cially dis­tanced in­ter­view at the Venice Film Fes­ti­val, dur­ing which she re­ceived a Life­time Achieve­ment Award, Swin­ton, 59, dis­cussed the movie’s un­usual shoot and ex­plained why she is ex­cited about the dis­rup­tive ef­fects of stream­ing ser­vices on the film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>These are edited ex­cerpts from that con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing The Hu­man Voice was a very cathar­tic ex­pe­ri­ence for me. A lot of ten­sion builds up as your char­ac­ter waits around, and then, there is this erup­tion of vi­o­lence. Did it feel cathar­tic to make it?</p>
    <p>It was so cathar­tic to make a film with Pedro, be­cause I’ve ba­si­cally been dream­ing of that my en­tire life.</p>
    <p>And it was re­ally won­der­ful to make some­thing in July. That was such a bless­ing. We were all so happy to work – and to prove to our­selves that we could do it.</p>
    <p>We’re just go­ing to have to evolve and we just have to fig­ure it out. We fig­ured it out with this movie: We’re in a stu­dio; we’re with a rel­a­tively small crew; it’s en­tirely con­trolled; we were con­stantly tested. And we just did it.</p>
    <p>How did be­ing on a film set again feel?</p>
    <p>It was like hav­ing held your breath underwater for a long time.</p>
    <p>I’m find­ing the most bor­der­line trau­matic things are the things that are sim­i­lar: If ev­ery­thing was com­pletely dif­fer­ent, it might be eas­ier to adapt, but when things are any­thing like what you recog­nise from be­fore March, it is con­fus­ing, and con­fu­sion is very ex­haust­ing.</p>
    <p>So, af­ter a mil­lisec­ond of re­al­is­ing there were go­ing to be crew mem­bers I will never recog­nise with­out their masks, we j ust ap­proached shoot­ing a film the way we al­ways would have shot it: A few things are go­ing to change in this new world and so much more is not go­ing to change.</p>
    <p>Did you learn any­thing un­ex­pected dur­ing lock­down?</p>
    <p>Noth­ing’s new un­der the sun. Dur­ing lock­down – and this has been the first, but there may be more – there was an op­por­tu­nity to re­flect on all we have.</p>
    <p>My mantra at the mo­ment is that we have what we need. We just need to look and see it.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing’s new un­der the sun. Dur­ing lock­down – and this has been the first, but there may be more – there was an op­por­tu­nity to re­flect on all we have. My mantra at the mo­ment is that we have what we need. We just need to look and see it.</p>
    <p>What did you miss most?</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­body missed big-screen cin­ema in a way that they missed very lit­tle else. That was – and still is – a thing that we have to rally around.</p>
    <p>Just that sharp­en­ing of that ap­petite for the big­ger screen. Feel­ing that it might be months be­fore I’d get a chance to be in a the­atre again, that was re­ally sore. Just the sharp­en­ing of that de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>It al­most sounds like an ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Well, for some of us, it is.</p>
    <p>The thing that’s be­com­ing clear is that it’s not about what’s on the screen. It’s the screen it­self and it’s be­ing in that au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>When you ac­cepted your Life­time Achieve­ment Award in Venice, you said you were just get­ting started. What is next?</p>
    <p>I’ve been work­ing on an es­say film about learn­ing for a while, but we’re back to the draw­ing board be­cause what was a rel­a­tively es­o­teric, niche in­quiry about “What should a school be?” is now some­thing ev­ery­body’s ask­ing, now that peo­ple have to think about home­school­ing or just be de­prived of school.</p>
    <p>Through my ex­pe­ri­ence of work­ing with the school I co-founded (which is mod­elled on out­door, stu­dent-led learn­ing), I’ve re­alised we no longer need a school for shar­ing in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>You can ed­u­cate your­self via your phone, so then, the ques­tion is: What did chil­dren miss about school dur­ing lock­down and what do they value school for?</p>
    <p>This is an op­por­tu­nity to re­ally shake it up and I’m glad the film can be ask­ing these ques­tions.</p>
    <p>AC­TRESS TILDA SWIN­TON, on what she learnt dur­ing lock­down</p>
    <p>Cate Blanchett, the Venice jury pres­i­dent, and Al­berto Bar­bera, the fes­ti­val’s artis­tic di­rec­tor, both used speeches to cau­tion that the rise of stream­ing ser­vices, es­pe­cially dur­ing lock­down, is a threat to cin­ema. Do you share that worry?</p>
    <p>I re­ally don’t. I never have. It will just mean that we have to stay sup­ple and lim­ber: Cin­ema can do it. I’m all for ne­ces­sity be­ing the mother of in­ven­tion. I’m ac­tu­ally, if any­thing, ex­cited. Bring it on.</p>
    <p>I’ve heard peo­ple be wor­ried for a few years now, and then, in the pan­demic, a very in­ter­est­ing thing hap­pens.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, those con­cerns be­come am­pli­fied, but, on the other hand, look what hap­pens: Ev­ery­one is long­ing to go to the cin­ema. I don’t think there will ever be a time when peo­ple don’t want to go and sit in a big space in the dark.</p>
    <p>The is­sue, as with so much that’s com­ing to the fore, is money and cap­i­tal­ism, and there is this whole ques­tion of fi­nanc­ing films.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are just go­ing to have to get lively and roll up their sleeves and fig­ure it out.</p>
