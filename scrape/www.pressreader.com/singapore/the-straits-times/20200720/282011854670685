    <p>When MacPher­son res­i­dent Tan Meng Huat, 66, needed to file a claim with in­surer NTUC In­come, he did not know what to do.</p>
    <p>The taxi driver, who lives in Gey­lang East Av­enue 1, de­cided to seek the help of his MP Tin Pei Ling.</p>
    <p>Within two days, Ms Tin replied with a set of in­struc­tions for him to sub­mit his claims for the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tan: “A lot of peo­ple said she was too young in 2011, but she kept try­ing and proved her­self be­cause her heart is in the right place.</p>
    <p>“Even though she didn’t have much ex­pe­ri­ence then, you can al­ways tell she re­ally wants to help.”</p>
    <p>Keep­ing a fin­ger on the pulse of res­i­dents’ needs has helped boost Ms Tin’s pop­u­lar­ity in the sin­gle­seat con­stituency with 28,513 vot­ers.</p>
    <p>In the most re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, Ms Tin se­cured 71.74 per cent of the votes against Peo­ple’s Power Party chief Goh Meng Seng.</p>
    <p>The re­sult – a jump of more than six per­cent­age points from 2015, when she got 65.6 per cent – meant MacPher­son gave the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) its largest up­ward swing in the 2020 polls.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin, 36, does not seem like she will rest on her lau­rels, and is racing ahead with a roll-out of plans for the ma­ture es­tate.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, she teamed up with the so­cial de­vel­op­ment en­ter­prise Char­ac­ter & Lead­er­ship Academy to launch an ini­tia­tive to help young peo­ple fac­ing men­tal health is­sues in MacPher­son.</p>
    <p>The Hap­pYouth pro­gramme aims to pro­vide youth with an un­der­stand­ing of stress and de­pres­sion as well as skills to men­tor oth­ers who may suf­fer from these is­sues.</p>
    <p>While the de­tails for the pro­gramme in MacPher­son are still be­ing worked out, it is likely to en­tail a mix of vir­tual classes, sup­port groups and block vis­its to ad­dress the men­tal well-be­ing of young res­i­dents in the con­stituency.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times last Wed­nes­day, Ms Tin said: “A lot of peo­ple think MacPher­son is a ma­ture es­tate, which is true, but we also have young peo­ple, and ev­ery­one has got their own bat­tles to fight.</p>
    <p>“So hope­fully with this we can in­crease our out­reach to go in deeper and build up a net­work of sup­port for our youth.”</p>
    <p>Hap­pYouth has seen more than four times its usual re­quests for coach­ing be­tween April and last month – with the in­ci­dence of men­tal health is­sues among youth go­ing up amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr De­lane Lim, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Char­ac­ter & Lead­er­ship Academy, said the main stress fac­tor for young peo­ple now is se­cur­ing jobs and pro­vid­ing for their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“We fore­see that this im­pact will con­tinue to worsen, but we are hop­ing that as we en­gage our youth in our pro­gramme, we can help them to see what other pos­si­bil­i­ties there are and how they can also be the eyes and ears for their own peers,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin said build­ing a strong foun­da­tion from a young age is also seen as be­ing piv­otal to help­ing young peo­ple han­dle stress and de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>She added: “When you have a strong sense of self, you’re less likely to be af­fected by the com­ments of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“You’re more con­fi­dent. You’re less wor­ried about how other peo­ple see you or judge you.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tin her­self was the sub­ject of pub­lic scru­tiny in 2011, when she was in­tro­duced as a new PAP can­di­date for Marine Pa­rade GRC, which at the time in­cluded MacPher­son.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign that year, among other things, pic­tures of her pos­ing with a Kate Spade bag – a gift from her se­nior civil ser­vant hus­band Ng How Yue – drew crit­i­cism from some peo­ple.</p>
    <p>When the PAP got 56.64 per cent of the votes in Marine Pa­rade GRC, then Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, who an­chored the team, cited the neg­a­tive pub­lic­ity sur­round­ing Ms Tin as a “fac­tor” in the re­sults.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Ms Tin de­clined to com­ment on the re­cent elec­tion re­sults, but let her work speak for it­self.</p>
    <p>In the run-up to the July 10 polls, Ms Tin launched a scheme that will help 100 lower-in­come house­holds in MacPher­son pay only half of their elec­tric­ity bills for one year, with the other half to be cov­ered by li­censed en­ergy re­tailer Sun­seap En­ergy.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal firm, which is a sub­sidiary of so­lar en­ergy so­lu­tions provider Sun­seap Group, will also pro­vide these homes with so­lar en­ergy, as part of a so­cial ini­tia­tive to pro­vide clean and af­ford­able en­ergy to house­holds.</p>
    <p>Also in the pipe­line for res­i­dents are di­a­logues and work­shops, where pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians and other job seek­ers can get ad­vice from ca­reer coun­sel­lors.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren from lower-in­come fam­i­lies also stand to ben­e­fit from a Cod­ing For Chil­dren pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Ms Tin said: “When you feel con­nected to a par­tic­u­lar group of peo­ple, you will al­ways want to do more for them. It’s like you would for your fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“More so now with the cri­sis, I think there’s a real sense of mis­sion be­cause a lot of peo­ple are go­ing through a lot of pain... Some­times you can’t help ev­ery­one but even if you just help one per­son that is a re­ally good thing.”</p>
