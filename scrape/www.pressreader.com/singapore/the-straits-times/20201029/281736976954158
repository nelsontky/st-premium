    <p>Pub­lic trans­port work­ers abused in the course of work will now re­ceive guar­an­teed le­gal sup­port from the union and their em­ploy­ers should they want to pur­sue civil ac­tion against their abusers.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the four pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors here and the Na­tional Trans­port Work­ers’ Union (NTWU) signed a joint mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) to pro­vide all nec­es­sary sup­port to such work­ers, in­clud­ing le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows a spate of high-pro­file abuse cases on Sin­ga­pore’s buses, which has seen a spike this year as driv­ers come into con­flict with pas­sen­gers over mask-wear­ing rules amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There was pre­vi­ously no guar­an­tee that le­gal ac­tion by pub­lic trans­port work­ers would be backed and sup­ported by the union and their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Melvin Yong, ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary of NTWU, said that with the MOU, the work­ers are given this as­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>“We want to send a strong de­ter­rent mes­sage that such abu­sive acts will not be tol­er­ated. A po­lice re­port will be made for ev­ery as­sault case against our pub­lic trans­port work­ers while on duty,” added Mr Yong, who is MP for Radin Mas SMC.</p>
    <p>The MOU was a re­sult of a se­ries of month-long dis­cus­sions that in­volved SMRT, SBS Tran­sit, Tower Tran­sit Sin­ga­pore, GoA­head Sin­ga­pore, NTWU and the Land Trans­port Author­ity.</p>
    <p>It comes even as NTWU is ex­plor­ing other pre­ven­tive mea­sures, such as plas­tic screens around the bus driver’s seat, to stop egre­gious acts from hos­tile, and some­times drunk, pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit’s act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Cheng Siak Kian, whose em­ployee was in­sulted and beaten for 12 min­utes in an in­ci­dent last month, said the MOU shows no ef­fort will be spared in help­ing such vic­tims seek jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, SBS Tran­sit dis­closed that it had close to 40 cases of pub­lic trans­port work­ers be­ing as­saulted this year, about half of which were mask-re­lated. There were 33 cases in the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>Tower Tran­sit Sin­ga­pore said it had one mi­nor case this year in­volv­ing a pas­sen­ger who got phys­i­cal with a bus driver. Its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Winston Toh said abuse of pub­lic trans­port work­ers goes against the “car­ing com­mut­ing cul­ture that Sin­ga­pore as­pires to”.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment this month, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat, who wit­nessed the sign­ing of the MOU yes­ter­day, said those who abuse pub­lic trans­port work­ers would face the full force of the law, which can in­clude up to three years in jail when con­victed of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt.</p>
    <p>He also called for the “right so­ci­etal cul­ture, one that is based on re­spect for our front-line work­ers”, and re­it­er­ated the zero-tol­er­ance ap­proach the Gov­ern­ment has to­wards abu­sive be­hav­iour.</p>
