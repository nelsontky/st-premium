    <p>Con­struc­tion com­pa­nies which need help with ap­ply­ing to restart work can now go to two help cen­tres set up by the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA).</p>
    <p>The two cen­tres, called “restart clin­ics”, will open on Mon­day and are housed at BCA’s premises in Brad­dell and Jurong East. They will op­er­ate on week­days from 8.30am to 12.30pm, and 1.30pm to 5pm.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for National De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee an­nounced this in a Face­book post yes­ter­day after visit­ing the Cus­ca­den Re­serve con­do­minium work­site in Cus­ca­den Road.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said care­ful plan­ning and man­age­ment were key in al­low­ing main con­trac­tor TPS Con­struc­tion to re­sume work.</p>
    <p>He noted that with five sub­con­trac­tors do­ing var­i­ous works, TPS Con­struc­tion had to make sure that work­ers from dif­fer­ent teams did not in­ter­min­gle.</p>
    <p>This in­volved seg­re­gat­ing the work­site into zones and im­ple­ment­ing stag­gered tim­ings for the start and end of work, among other safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The site also fea­tures tem­po­rary quar­ters for work­ers and staff, as well as a sick bay and iso­la­tion room.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the chal­lenges we have faced in the last few months have been un­prece­dented, and we know it has been an ex­tremely dif­fi­cult time for ev­ery­one in the con­struc­tion sec­tor and their fam­i­lies,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>The two restart clin­ics are an ex­am­ple of how BCA is work­ing closely with the in­dus­try to help firms, he said.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can make an ap­point­ment by call­ing 1800-342-5222 or through an on­line form at https://go.gov.sg/bca-form-restart­clinic</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the au­thor­i­ties gave the green light for around 40,000 ad­di­tional work­ers to restart work with­out their em­ploy­ers need­ing to ap­ply for ap­provals.</p>
    <p>The change ap­plies to jobs that re­quire rel­a­tively few work­ers, such as lift main­te­nance and ren­o­va­tion work.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, em­ploy­ers can now be­gin work even if their work­ers are housed at more than 10 ad­dresses, after the BCA tem­po­rar­ily eased the rule.</p>
    <p>TPS Con­struc­tion was al­ready able to re­sume work in a sig­nif­i­cant way early last month ow­ing to the var­i­ous safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures it put in place, but the eas­ing of re­stric­tions is still a wel­come boost, said the com­pany’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Sharine Teo.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause a con­struc­tion site will typ­i­cally see work­ers from many dif­fer­ent ad­dresses in­ter­act with one an­other, as a main con­trac­tor like TPS Con­struc­tion would have to en­gage sub­con­trac­tors which han­dle more spe­cialised tasks like paint­ing or in­stalling air-con­di­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>“You def­i­nitely need more than 10 sub­con­trac­tors for all these tasks. And if the sub­con­trac­tors can­not come in be­cause of the re­stric­tions, then these parts of the work will get stuck,” said Ms Teo.</p>
    <p>“What re­ally helped us was the fact that our work­ers are crosstrain­ed in a va­ri­ety of tasks, and once all of them were healthy, they were able to start work with just a su­per­vi­sor from a sub­con­trac­tor over­see­ing them, for ex­am­ple.”</p>
    <p>TPS Con­struc­tion also houses all its 250 for­eign work­ers in a sin­gle lo­ca­tion, which meant that all could re­sume work once their ac­com­mo­da­tion was cleared of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo said the Covid-19 pan­demic rep­re­sents the big­gest chal­lenge faced by her com­pany in 30 years in the in­dus­try. “Now, ev­ery­body has to work to­gether to make sure we are safe, even if pro­duc­tiv­ity is lower. At least there is work, and there is in­come.”</p>
