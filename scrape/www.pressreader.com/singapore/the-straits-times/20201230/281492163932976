    <p>At the end of a very un­usual and chal­leng­ing year, with Covid-19 caus­ing se­ri­ous eco­nomic and social dis­rup­tion, Sin­ga­pore needs “all hands on deck” to over­come the cri­sis and build a better fu­ture for gen­er­a­tions to come, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said yes­ter­day in her New Year mes­sage.</p>
    <p>She added that she was con­fi­dent Sin­ga­pore­ans were up to the task, not­ing that they have shown, time and again, to be made of sterner stuff, with crises strength­en­ing them and mak­ing them even more re­silient.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in a video re­leased by the Is­tana, Madam Hal­imah said: “We now have to re­assess the way we or­gan­ise our lives, work and busi­nesses as there is no go­ing back to the pre-Covid-19 pe­riod. But there are also op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the use of tech­nol­ogy, and long-term chal­lenges such as cli­mate change have gained a new im­pe­tus. Coun­tries are us­ing the op­por­tu­nity to re­shape their re­cov­ery towards a more green and sus­tain­able econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah also noted that Sin­ga­pore was still ex­pe­ri­enc­ing eco­nomic head­winds in­duced by the pan­demic, par­tic­u­larly in the aero­space and tourism-re­lated sec­tors.</p>
    <p>She said that with con­certed ef­forts, a full re­cov­ery may take one or two years – and even then, the next decade will see slower growth with higher ex­pen­di­ture.</p>
    <p>“We must con­tinue to make crit­i­cal in­vest­ments in our in­fra­struc­ture and skills de­vel­op­ment so that we can con­tinue to at­tract new in­vest­ments and cre­ate new jobs,” Madam Hal­imah added.</p>
    <p>She pointed out that Sin­ga­pore, like other coun­tries strug­gling with tight fis­cal po­si­tions, has had to dip into past re­serves to sup­port af­fected busi­nesses and work­ers.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Pres­i­dent ap­proved the in­jec­tion of an ex­tra $8 bil­lion in Covid-19 sup­port. The Gov­ern­ment has passed nearly $100 bil­lion of relief mea­sures, with up to $52 bil­lion drawn from the re­serves.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, the Gov­ern­ment’s fis­cal po­si­tion will con­tinue to be very tight, but we also can­not adopt poli­cies that will cause the econ­omy to con­tract, which can de­lay our re­cov­ery,” said Madam Hal­imah. “It’s a fine bal­ance, with the peo­ple’s in­ter­est at our core in what­ever we do.”</p>
    <p>She also thanked health­care pro­fes­sion­als for their ded­i­ca­tion and stead­fast­ness in keep­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans safe.</p>
    <p>And while the avail­abil­ity of Covid-19 vac­cines is cause for cheer, Sin­ga­pore­ans have to heed ex­pert ad­vice on the on­go­ing need to be cau­tious, added the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>She said in an ac­com­pa­ny­ing Face­book post that as more ac­tiv­i­ties re­sume un­der phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, which kicked off on Mon­day, it was important to stay vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>“My grat­i­tude, too, to all other front-line work­ers. With­out your ser­vices, life would have been very un­pleas­ant for us as we can­not ac­cess ba­sic ameni­ties and feel se­cure,” said Madam Hal­imah, who has spo­ken of­ten of the need to strengthen men­tal health re­silience in a stress­ful year.</p>
