    <p>Un­able to snag a spot at Changi’s Juras­sic Mile? You can find the liv­ing de­scen­dants of di­nosaurs along Sin­ga­pore’s Park Con­nec­tor Net­work (PCN). Although birds may not be as huge or ter­ri­fy­ing as their an­ces­tors, they are just as daz­zling. Grab your binoc­u­lars and check out some of these avian hot spots along the PCN. Ang Qing points out some high­lights.</p>
    <p>WEST</p>
    <p>• The Western Ad­ven­ture Loop takes you through the parks and green­ways in western Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>• Jurong Lake Gar­dens is a great place to start for bird watch­ers with chil­dren. • While hous­ing the largest na­ture-themed play space in the heart­land, it is also home to var­i­ous gar­den and wet­land birds such as the black-crowned night heron (Nyc­ti­co­rax nyc­ti­co­rax) and sa­vanna night­jar (Caprimul­gus affi­nis).</p>
    <p>BIRD FUN FACT</p>
    <p>The black-crowned night heron's (right) sci­en­tific name means “night raven”, be­cause of its noc­tur­nal na­ture and raven-like call. This pa­tient bird hunts by stand­ing still in the dark for long pe­ri­ods of time at the fringe of wa­ter bod­ies.</p>
    <p>NORTH</p>
    <p>• Lo­cated on the North­ern Ex­plorer Loop, the Cen­tral Catch­ment Park Con­nec­tor is a gritty 1.9km trail that links Mandai Road to the Gangsa Trail that runs along the Bukit Timah Ex­press­way.</p>
    <p>• Trekkers can spot birds such as the greater racket-tailed drongo (Di­cru­rus par­adiseus), the ori­en­tal dol­lar­bird (Eurys­to­mus ori­en­talis) and the crim­son sun­bird (Aethopyga siparaja).</p>
    <p>The crim­son sun­bird (right) was un­of­fi­cially crowned the na­tional bird of Sin­ga­pore by the Na­ture So­ci­ety in 2015, af­ter top­ping its poll on the topic.</p>
    <p>The tiny red bird was se­lected by some vot­ers for em­body­ing Sin­ga­pore's nick­name of the Lit­tle Red Dot. Only males of this species have its dis­tinc­tive crim­son breast.</p>
    <p>CEN­TRAL</p>
    <p>• The Cen­tral Ur­ban Loop is a</p>
    <p>36km trail that show­cases green­ery amid Hous­ing Board es­tates in cen­tral Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>• It con­nects to the 3km-long Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park, which has a nat­u­ralised river that at­tracts wa­ter birds such as the pur­ple heron (Ardea pur­purea) and other species like the stork-billed king­fisher (Pe­largop­sis capen­sis). The stork-billed king­fisher (right) is the largest king­fisher found in Sin­ga­pore, grow­ing up to 35cm in length. While it is shyer than other king­fish­ers, it has a dis­tinc­tive “ka-ka-ka” call.</p>
    <p>NORTH-EAST</p>
    <p>• Over 80 species of res­i­dent and mi­gra­tory birds live on Coney Is­land.</p>
    <p>• Part of the North Eastern River­ine Loop, the is­land has coastal forests, grass­lands, man­groves and ca­sua­r­ina wood­lands.</p>
    <p>• Birds that can be found there in­clude the scaly-breasted mu­nia (Lonchura punc­tu­lata) and baya weaver (Plo­ceus philip­pi­nus).</p>
    <p>The baya weaver (left) is known for its glob­u­lar nests, which are usu­ally found hang­ing from aca­cia trees. These in­tri­cately built cham­bers are in­spected by fe­male weavers, which al­low only males that pass their qual­ity con­trol to mate with them.</p>
    <p>EAST</p>
    <p>• The Eastern Coastal Loop is per­fect for beach-lov­ing bird watch­ers.</p>
    <p>• The trail cuts through Pasir Ris Park, which is home to owls such as the buffy fish owl (Ke­tupa ke­tupu) and the spot­ted wood owl (Strix selop­uto).</p>
    <p>• East Coast Park is an­other pit stop with a va­ri­ety of birds such as the lit­tle bronze cuckoo (Chryso­coccy x minu­til­lus) and laced wood­pecker (Pi­cus vit­ta­tus).</p>
    <p>The lit­tle bronze cuckoo (right) is one of the small­est cuckoo species in the world. This par­a­sitic bird lays eggs in the nests of smaller gar­den birds so that its chicks can be raised by these fos­ter par­ents.</p>
