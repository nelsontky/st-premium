    <p>•</p>
    <p>A max­i­mum of six of­fi­cials per na­tional del­e­ga­tion will be al­lowed to par­tic­i­pate in the Pa­rade of Na­tions at the open­ing cer­e­mony of the post­poned Olympics, the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) an­nounced on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the IOC’s Tokyo Olympic Games Co­or­di­na­tion Com­mis­sion chair­man John Coates, who at­tended a project re­view with or­gan­is­ers, in­sisted that the num­ber of ath­letes at the cer­e­mony would not be cut.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to change the tra­di­tion that all ath­letes have the op­por­tu­nity to pa­rade at the open­ing cer­e­mony,” the Aus­tralian, also an IOC vice-pres­i­dent, told reporters.</p>
    <p>Key I OC of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Coates and pres­i­dent Thomas Bach, have been in Tokyo this week as a show of sup­port for the or­gan­is­ers as they try to ar­range the Games de­spite the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the de­ci­sion in March to post­pone the Games, the Olympics are now due to be­gin on July 23 next year.</p>
    <p>The open­ing cer­e­mony at an Olympics is typ­i­cally a muchawaite­d spec­ta­cle. Ath­letes’ places are usu­ally filled by of­fi­cials from their na­tional Olympic com­mit­tees if they choose to fo­cus on prepa­ra­tions for their com­pe­ti­tions. But this will not hap­pen next year.</p>
    <p>“The IOC ex­ec­u­tive board has al­ready dis­cussed this and we won’t al­low it this time,” Coates added, not­ing that do­ing so “will in­crease the prob­lem at the cer­e­mony”.</p>
    <p>“We want to see the ath­letes from all 206 del­e­ga­tions and the refugee team in the open­ing cer­e­mony... The num­ber of of­fi­cials is lim­ited to six.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 pres­i­dent Yoshiro Mori, how­ever, was less en­thu­si­as­tic about the pos­si­bil­ity of see­ing all par­tic­i­pat­ing ath­letes march into the Olympic Sta­dium, although he ad­mit­ted that the pa­rade in the open­ing cer­e­mony was their “pre­rog­a­tive” and “no one can de­prive them of their right”.</p>
    <p>“We have to have a se­cure and safe Games,” he said, adding that some “sac­ri­fice” was needed.</p>
    <p>Mori said that it is still too early to make de­ci­sions be­cause it might not be a prob­lem to worry about.</p>
    <p>“Maybe we should ask the opin­ions of the ath­letes,” the for­mer Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>“Are they re­ally ea­ger to par­tic­i­pate in the pa­rade? Maybe they want to win the gold medals.</p>
    <p>“Ath­letes may have dif­fer­ent ideals. We should know their true feel­ing.”</p>
    <p>RAPID TEST­ING THE KEY?</p>
    <p>Over 11,000 ath­letes are ex­pected to de­scend on Tokyo for the Olympics and thou­sands more will come for the sub­se­quent Par­a­lympics. The ma­jor­ity will stay at the Ath­letes’ Vil­lage.</p>
    <p>Coates be­lieved that a so­phis­ti­cated and rapid test­ing method could be the key to safe­guard­ing par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>“We could do 40,000 to 50,000 tests a day of ath­letes at the mo­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It may be a quick so­lu­tion. That could be the an­swer for us.”</p>
    <p>He said that mea­sures should be taken to avoid an “over­pop­u­lated” vil­lage and sug­gested that not only the ath­letes but also all ref­er­ees should be tested.</p>
    <p>ATH­LETES ARE NOT TOURISTS</p>
    <p>When asked if he would dis­cour­age ath­letes from leav­ing the vil­lage for sight­see­ing, the Aus­tralian replied: “Yes.”</p>
    <p>“The ath­letes will un­der­stand</p>
    <p>their re­spon­si­bil­ity, to abide by the rules, which will guar­an­tee their safety,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>He added that the pur­pose-built vil­lage must be “the safest place in Tokyo” during the Games.</p>
    <p>“The ath­letes have to have con­fi­dence in the safety of that.”</p>
    <p>In a break with tra­di­tion, Coates said ath­letes would not be able to stay in the vil­lage for the en­tire du­ra­tion of the Games.</p>
    <p>“The ath­letes, once their com­pe­ti­tion fin­ishes, will have one day, two days and then they will go</p>
    <p>home,” said the Aus­tralian.</p>
    <p>“The pe­riod of stay­ing longer, in a vil­lage, in­creases the po­ten­tial for prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>He said the IOC’s ath­letes’ com­mis­sion had given or­gan­is­ers their full sup­port. The or­gan­is­ers did not fi­nalise con­crete Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures in three days of talks.</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Toshiro Muto said more poli­cies would be fi­nalised in time for the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee’s bud­get an­nounce­ment next month.</p>
