    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your love life is heat­ing up – or you are go­ing through a spring thaw. You can fig­ure out what comes next, but en­joy the new vibe.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You know you are in the right, but that does not mean oth­ers agree. Avoid preach­ing to people, as they are more open to gen­tle per­sua­sion.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You are hav­ing a great time de­bat­ing the finer points of your big plan or deep philo­soph­i­cal is­sue. In either case, your brain is en­gaged.</p>
    <p>Cancer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your ex­trav­a­gance is a ne­ces­sity. If you spend more on your­self, it is for a good cause. You need to take care of your­self in or­der to help oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your creative side is en­gaged and your an­swers are smart and funny, so speak up. It is eas­ier than ever to im­press the pow­ers that be.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Avoid show­ing off too much. If you must, show your suc­cesses rather than just brag­ging, as most people are scep­ti­cal of what they hear.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Stay ac­tive – people are won­der­ing what is go­ing on and only you can of­fer them guid­ance. Things may get re­ally good soon.</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You have an ego like ev­ery­one else – but yours causes prob­lems that oth­ers can­not un­der­stand. You may have to ex­plain a weird out­burst.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s</p>
    <p>(Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your ter­rific en­ergy helps you prove your­self to some­one who may be won­der­ing where your loy­al­ties lie. De­vote your­self to the big­ger cause.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>It may feel as if people are go­ing out of their way to cause trou­ble, but they are just con­fused or im­pa­tient. Try to ac­com­mo­date them.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are in­ter­rupted time and again – it gets to be funny af­ter a while. Stay fo­cused on what you must do, but if you get dis­tracted, make it fun.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20) Main­tain­ing con­cen­tra­tion is tough, but if you can do so, you are sure to stay ahead. If you get too dis­tracted, you may want to quit early.</p>
