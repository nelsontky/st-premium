    <p>• For­mula One leader Lewis Hamil­ton heads to to­mor­row’s Bel­gian Grand Prix in the form of his life and favourite to keep the party go­ing for Mercedes.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton, who leads Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen by 37 points, has won four of six races and is fast ap­proach­ing a sev­enth ti­tle and Michael Schu­macher’s record 91 wins. Hamil­ton has 88 vic­to­ries and the de­lay to ban en­gine power unit “party” modes in qual­i­fy­ing un­til the next race in Monza, Italy, will be a fur­ther boost for his chances at Spa-Fran­cor­champs.</p>
    <p>“I’m al­ways talk­ing about per­fect races and that was one of them,” said Hamil­ton on win­ning the pre­vi­ous round in Spain. “I think I’m just in my high­est form.”</p>
    <p>Dutch­man Ver­stap­pen, who was born in Bel­gium, will be do­ing all he can at a race that counts as home ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The high-speed track may not play to his car’s strengths but, af­ter a sur­prise win at the 70th An­niver­sary race in Sil­ver­stone, he is not rul­ing any­thing out.</p>
    <p>“We don’t expect this race will be our favourite this year in terms of the lay­out suit­ing our pack­age, but we will be push­ing hard as we have done at every race,” said the only non-Mercedes win­ner this sea­son.</p>
    <p>F1 yes­ter­day said it will hold the sec­ond of its two Bahrain races around a short­ened, fast lay­out that will take cars less than 55 sec­onds to lap in qual­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>At 3.543km, the 11-cor­ner lay­out which makes up the “outer cir­cuit” of the Sakhir desert track will be the sec­ond-short­est be­hind Monaco, which has been axed.</p>
    <p>The Sakhir Grand Prix will have the high­est num­ber of laps at 87 and take place on Dec 6, a week af­ter the Bahrain Grand Prix.</p>
