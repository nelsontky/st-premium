    <p>Af­ter his death, Sin­ga­pore Funeral Ser­vices (SFS) se­nior funeral di­rec­tor Hoo Hung Chye wants his ashes to re­main at home, in the com­pany of fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Ziqian, mean­while, is un­de­cided. The di­rec­tor of Ang Chin Moh Funeral Di­rec­tors has con­sid­ered burial, hav­ing his ashes turned into a memo­rial di­a­mond or dis­persed at sea via a seashell­shaped biodegrad­able urn.</p>
    <p>They do, how­ever, have one thing in com­mon. Both men are ac­cus­tomed to talk­ing about death and be­lieve it would ben­e­fit so­ci­ety to do the same.</p>
    <p>Mr Hoo, 41, says: “We are see­ing more young people who want to talk to their par­ents about end-oflife prepa­ra­tions.”</p>
    <p>This in­cludes pre­par­ing le­gal doc­u­ments such as a will and a last­ing power of at­tor­ney, as well as in­form­ing fam­ily mem­bers about the last rites they want.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing these con­ver­sa­tions ahead of time pre­vents con­flict among fam­ily mem­bers, un­for­tu­nately a com­mon­place sight in funeral homes.</p>
    <p>Some­times, the de­ceased may have ac­cepted a new re­li­gion but in­formed only one mem­ber of the fam­ily, lead­ing to dis­agree­ments over the re­li­gious rites, says Mr Hoo.</p>
    <p>These are some of the sto­ries par­tic­i­pants will hear dur­ing the Af­ter Hours @ My Toa Payoh tour.</p>
    <p>The tour starts at mid­night and vis­its both SFS and Fly­ing Home. The lat­ter spe­cialises in funeral repa­tri­a­tion – such as send­ing a body to its fi­nal rest­ing place over­seas, or repa­tri­at­ing a body when a death oc­curs out­side of Sin­ga­pore – and is owned by Ang Chin Moh Funeral Di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>Quiet even in the day, the in­dus­trial com­plex in Toa Payoh that houses a clutch of funeral homes is more than a lit­tle spooky af­ter dark. Inside, how­ever, both SFS and Fly­ing Home are brightly lit, the lat­ter look­ing more like a slick apart­ment than a funeral home.</p>
    <p>Rows of cas­kets and coffins line the walls.</p>
    <p>It is my first time ob­serv­ing one so in­tently, free from the melan­choly of wakes I have at­tended. Staff en­cour­age me to tap on the cas­kets and even peer un­der the lid.</p>
    <p>Those in­tended for cre­ma­tion are made from com­pos­ite wood; oth­ers meant for burial are made from metal or stur­dier wood. White cas­kets are a pop­u­lar choice for young women. One of them has del­i­cate pink flow­ers painted on the sides.</p>
    <p>There are other ways to end one’s jour­ney – in a di­a­mond, a piece of memo­rial jew­ellery, sent up into space; or re­turn­ing to the ground in a biodegrad­able urn.</p>
    <p>These last rites are ways to of­fer com­fort and dig­nity to the be­reaved, says Mr Hoo. “Many will be lost and emo­tion­ally dis­traught. We are here to give ad­vice and op­tions on what they can do.”</p>
    <p>None of it is mor­bid. In fact, hav­ing a front-row seat to death makes Mr Ang, 39, even more de­ter­mined to live a mean­ing­ful life.</p>
    <p>“Never have an­gry words when you part with any­one as you never know if you will get to see him or her again,” he says.</p>
    <p>“It’s easy to say, yet hard to prac­tise. But recog­nis­ing that death is an even­tu­al­ity means I don’t take life for granted.” AF­TER HOURS @ MY TOA PAYOH</p>
