    <p>When his fam­ily ran into fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties, Mr Lee Rui Xuan quit school to work, and even faked ill­ness in the army to do part-time jobs. But he was caught go­ing ab­sent with­out of­fi­cial leave and sen­tenced to a stint in the de­ten­tion bar­racks. His time there made him more de­ter­mined to suc­ceed, and to go back to school.</p>
    <p>Once a star stu­dent in school, Mr Lee Rui Xuan felt he hit rock bot­tom in 2017, when he was thrown into the army’s de­ten­tion bar­racks for go­ing Awol (ab­sent with­out of­fi­cial leave) from camp dur­ing his na­tional ser­vice (NS).</p>
    <p>There, he dis­cov­ered that some of his sec­ondary school class­mates were his war­dens, as they were serv­ing their NS as mil­i­tary po­lice.</p>
    <p>“It was a huge blow to my self-es­teem, I never thought I would have to fol­low their or­ders,” said Mr Lee, 22.</p>
    <p>It was also a fall from grace for Mr Lee, who be­lieved he had a promis­ing fu­ture af­ter scor­ing an L1R5 (English plus five rel­e­vant sub­jects) of eight points in his O-level ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>He had en­rolled in Ngee Ann Polytech­nic’s aero­space elec­tron­ics course in 2014 af­ter fin­ish­ing his stud­ies at Wood­lands Ring Sec­ondary School, and was mid­way through his first se­mes­ter when things started go­ing down­hill for his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, 56, the fam­ily’s sole bread­win­ner, had left his job as an elec­tri­cal engi­neer and started his own busi­ness.</p>
    <p>But when the busi­ness failed to take off, his par­ents started giv­ing him and his younger si­b­lings – his sis­ter, now 21, and brother, now 19 – less pocket money, re­called Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>“As the days pro­gressed, we had less food and pocket money. That’s when I knew some­thing was very wrong,” he said.</p>
    <p>At one point, he was given just $3 every day which was barely enough for him, af­ter fac­tor­ing in his trans­port costs to school, he said.</p>
    <p>He took on a part-time job as a cashier and used the $300 to $400 he earned every month for his daily ex­penses and to con­trib­ute to the house­hold in­come.</p>
    <p>His mother, 53, also started do­ing odd jobs to ease their fi­nances.</p>
    <p>By his sec­ond se­mes­ter in poly, how­ever, he re­alised his par­ents were strug­gling to foot his school fees.</p>
    <p>One day, his par­ents, who are not lit­er­ate in English, asked him to read aloud a let­ter they had re­ceived from his school.</p>
    <p>The let­ter de­tailed his un­paid school fees, and it was then that Mr Lee re­alised the ex­tent of his fam­ily’s fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion. He de­cided to quit school to work full time.</p>
    <p>“I thought since we had al­ready reached such a stage, I might as well drop out and go to work.”</p>
    <p>He rea­soned that both his par­ents could af­ford to pay for the ex­penses of only two chil­dren still in school.</p>
    <p>“So let it be my two younger si­b­lings in­stead,” he added.</p>
    <p>“My par­ents didn’t re­ally agree to it, they wanted me to get back to study­ing... but I said ‘let me help’.”</p>
    <p>He worked two jobs af­ter quit­ting school – as an ad­min­is­tra­tion ex­ec­u­tive on week­days and a cashier on week­ends.</p>
    <p>The $2,000 he brought home from these two jobs helped pay the house­hold bills.</p>
    <p>Af­ter about a year of work­ing, he was called up for NS.</p>
    <p>While home on a one-week break from the army, he over­heard a heated con­ver­sa­tion be­tween his par­ents and sis­ter about her pocket money.</p>
    <p>He found out from his si­b­lings that they found it hard to go out with friends or hang out in school as they could not af­ford to do so.</p>
    <p>“Even if their classes were just two hours long, they would come home straight af­ter, and stay home most of the time,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>It was then that he de­cided to earn some ex­tra cash for them.</p>
    <p>When he was back in camp, he feigned be­ing sick when­ever he could.</p>
    <p>Some days, he told the med­i­cal of­fi­cer there that he had “insomnia”. Other times, he would com­plain of a bad cough.</p>
    <p>But when he re­ceived a med­i­cal cer­tifi­cate, he would go out and do odd jobs in­stead, help­ing out at a ware­house about two to three times a week.</p>
    <p>This went on for about a month, un­til his su­per­vi­sors in the army grew sus­pi­cious and dis­cov­ered he was not at home when he was sup­posed to be “rest­ing”, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>They called him in for a meet­ing and told him they knew he had gone Awol.</p>
    <p>He was also told that the max­i­mum penalty for this was two years in the de­ten­tion bar­racks.</p>
    <p>“I was very scared... but they said if I co­op­er­ated with the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, they could dras­ti­cally re­duce the sen­tence,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he ex­plained to them his home sit­u­a­tion, he was sen­tenced to six weeks in the de­ten­tion bar­racks.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing his NS, he served his sen­tence in a cell with two other men.</p>
    <p>“I felt very out of it, like I knew I didn’t be­long there,” said Mr Lee, adding that some of his cell­mates were drug ad­dicts.</p>
    <p>The war­dens were his for­mer class­mates, who told him about their plans to fur­ther their stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally made me think about what I was do­ing with my life,” he said. “I thought I must buck up, go back to where I’m sup­posed to be.”</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence strength­ened his re­solve to fin­ish his stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, fi­nances were not as tight at home by then, as his fa­ther was work­ing as a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer, his mother as a cashier, and his sis­ter found part-time work as a barista.</p>
    <p>He was re­leased early af­ter about four weeks for good be­hav­iour, and he en­rolled in Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s (SP) bio-engi­neer­ing course in April last year.</p>
    <p>“At first I was still quite play­ful, be­cause I could not be­lieve that I was fi­nally study­ing again,” he said, laugh­ing.</p>
    <p>But he knuck­led down and sought the help of his lec­tur­ers and friends.</p>
    <p>He scored a grade point av­er­age of 3.88 in his first year, and re­ceived an SP Engi­neer­ing Schol­ar­ship, which is awarded to those in the top 5 per cent of their co­hort.</p>
    <p>He plans to use the schol­ar­ship money of $3,000 per aca­demic year to off­set most of his school fees.</p>
    <p>Now in his sec­ond year at the polytech­nic, he hopes to be­come a med­i­cal equip­ment ser­vice engi­neer or a lec­turer.</p>
    <p>His polytech­nic lec­turer, Dr Ngoh Shwu Lan, de­scribed him as a highly mo­ti­vated and self-dis­ci­plined stu­dent.</p>
    <p>“Rui Xuan is al­ways com­mit­ted and is able to make sen­si­ble de­ci­sions when­ever needed,” said Dr Ngoh, who is the course chair of SP’s bio-engi­neer­ing diploma course.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, Mr Lee said he re­gret­ted go­ing Awol in the army.</p>
    <p>He re­alised only later that the army had schemes to help those with fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>“I think es­pe­cially be­cause we are in Sin­ga­pore, we shouldn’t try to skirt around the law, there’s al­ways a dif­fer­ent av­enue for you to get help,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Don’t be afraid to ask for help.”</p>
    <p>MO­MENT OF RE­FLEC­TION</p>
    <p>I felt very out of it, like I knew I didn’t be­long there... It re­ally made me think about what I was do­ing with my life. ’’</p>
    <p>MR LEE RUI XUAN</p>
