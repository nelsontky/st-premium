    <p>Lim­ited-edi­tion food boxes filled with In­sta­gram-wor­thy pas­tries or dough­nuts by home-based busi­nesses have be­come cov­eted goods since the pan­demic hit (see C7).</p>
    <p>This is due to the ap­peal of small­batch pro­duc­tion with qual­ity in­gre­di­ents; the thrill and brag­ging rights of snag­ging some highly soughtafte­r treats; and the feel-good fac­tor of sup­port­ing lo­cal busi­nesses – es­pe­cially those set up by peo­ple who lost their jobs in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many home-based busi­nesses – par­tic­u­larly those gear­ing up for Hari Raya sales – were hit dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker as they were not al­lowed to op­er­ate un­der the strict mea­sures im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>In April, con­tro­versy erupted on social media when ac­tress Atee­qah Ma­zlan was ac­cused of in­ad­ver­tently caus­ing the tem­po­rary ban on home­based busi­nesses by ask­ing on her Face­book page whether such busi­nesses could still op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on May 1, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob showed her sup­port for those who run such busi­nesses, which she pointed out are mainly women who may have chil­dren or el­derly par­ents to care for.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the tem­po­rary ban was lifted on May 12, some home-based busi­nesses have thrived. Hot prod­ucts in­clude pretty madeleines and fi­nanciers from She Sells Seashells; tarts from Tar­tis­serie; and de­li­cious sam­bal from 2 Ma­mas & A Wok.</p>
    <p>Home-based busi­nesses have also fared well in The Sun­day Times’ blind taste tests. Th­ese in­clude The Fat Kid Bak­ery, and Dough & Bat­ter for the choco­late and hazel­nut dough­nut taste test; as well as TA Kitchen, Lyn­nette’s</p>
    <p>Kitchen and Umami Boy for the XO sauce tast­ing.</p>
    <p>Newer home-based food brands are quickly gain­ing trac­tion as well.</p>
    <p>The plant-based, gluten- and dairy-free prod­ucts by Loaded Gun Kitchen have been quickly snapped up as gifts for Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>It of­fers three items, com­plete with cre­ative pack­ag­ing – sweet miso cashew cream, Kick-A** Ve­gan Kim­chi Hummus and Kom­bucha bar­be­cue pinto bean, a nat­u­rally sweet­ened bar­be­cue sauce.</p>
    <p>Th­ese can be used as dips, mari­nades, sauces, condi­ments or top­pings for grain bowls, pizza and pasta. Loaded Gun Kitchen has also part­nered an­other home-based business, Be­spoke Bread, to pair its sour­dough bread with the dips.</p>
    <p>Loaded Gun Kitchen’s founder Chan Fang Lynn, 29, plans to ex­pand her prod­uct range, pos­si­bly into ve­gan cloth­ing. But she is in no rush to open a store and wants to get a good grasp on e-com­merce first.</p>
    <p>She says: “Peo­ple are re­spond­ing to home-based busi­nesses with en­thu­si­asm and sup­port as they want to buy lo­cal – es­pe­cially if the prod­uct or business caters to their needs and life­styles.”</p>
