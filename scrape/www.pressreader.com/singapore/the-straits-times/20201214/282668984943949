    <p>When he was grow­ing up, Bangladesh­i mi­grant worker Is­lam Mo­ham­mad Sher­azul ate a lot of duck curry.</p>
    <p>“My mother taught me how to cook this dish,” says the con­struc­tion safety co­or­di­na­tor, 28. “Eat­ing this dish when I’m in Sin­ga­pore re­minds me of my fam­ily. ”</p>
    <p>When asked to take part in a new cook­ing show, he and his fel­low Bangladesh­i Roy Mithun Chandra, 33, chose duck curry as the dish they wanted to teach Sin­ga­pore­ans to make.</p>
    <p>As duck is a lit­tle more ex­pen­sive than chicken, says Mr Chandra, it is a spe­cial dish for hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The show, Cook To Con­nect, is an ini­tia­tive by non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions It­sRain­ingRain­coats and The White­hat­ters.</p>
    <p>It aims to bridge the cul­tural gap be­tween Sin­ga­pore­ans and mi­grant work­ers through cook­ing.</p>
    <p>In the first of two pre-recorded episodes, two Sin­ga­pore­ans teach Mr Sher­azul and Mr Chandra how to cook yam cake, a tra­di­tional Chi­nese dish made of rice flour, dried shrimp and yam.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond, both Bangladesh­i work­ers pass on their duck curry recipe to an­other pair of lo­cals.</p>
    <p>The two episodes will be livestream­ed on It­sRain­ingRain­coats’ Face­book page on Dec 20 and 27 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>View­ers are en­cour­aged to cook to­gether con­cur­rently as they watch the videos.</p>
    <p>It­sRain­ingRain­coats’ founder Dipa Swami­nathan, 49, came up with the idea for Cook To Con­nect in the mid­dle of this year when she re­alised cook­ing is a univer­sal ac­tiv­ity that both mi­grants and Sin­ga­pore­ans en­joy.</p>
    <p>“Some of these work­ers are good cooks,” she says.</p>
    <p>“They cook all the time and food is al­ways of com­fort to them. So I thought: What bet­ter way to build bridges than through cook­ing?”</p>
    <p>Cook To Con­nect lead vol­un­teer Kelly Shia, 30, says the or­gan­is­ers will pro­vide in­gre­di­ents for 100 mi­grant work­ers to take part in the cook-along ses­sions. Vol­un­teers will de­liver these to the work­ers’ res­i­dences on the two days.</p>
    <p>Only mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in Hous­ing Board flats will be able to take part in the ses­sions, due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions on dor­mi­tory res­i­dents’ move­ments.</p>
    <p>For hu­man re­source man­ager Ir­fana Nazmin, one of the Sin­ga­porean par­tic­i­pants, it was the first time she had in­ter­acted so closely with a mi­grant worker.</p>
    <p>“The duck curry turned out re­ally well,” says the 30-year-old, who was paired with Mr Sher­azul for the film­ing. “It was very nice and fra­grant.”</p>
    <p>She no­ticed Mr Sher­azul roasted and ground the cumin used in the duck curry him­self – ex­tra steps which she feels “cre­ated a smok­i­ness” that dis­tin­guishes it from other cur­ries in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The pair, just two years apart in age, bonded quickly dur­ing the record­ing ses­sion, with Mr Sher­azul even ask­ing Ms Nazmin to film a TikTok video for him.</p>
    <p>Mr Sher­azul and Mr Chandra barely get to in­ter­act with lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Mr Chandra says that in the 12 years he has been here, the Sin­ga­porean vol­un­teer he cooked with is the first Chi­nese man he has be­friended out­side of work.</p>
    <p>Mr Sher­azul says: “It was a very in­ter­est­ing ex­pe­ri­ence talk­ing to Sin­ga­pore­ans and I en­joyed cook­ing with them.”</p>
    <p>Cook To Con­nect also aims to de­liver care packs con­tain­ing toi­letries, food and cloth­ing to 500 work­ers this Christmas sea­son.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers will run a do­na­tion drive on Dec 23 for the pub­lic to drop off items such as pre-loved cloth­ing and ne­ces­si­ties.</p>
    <p>“One care pack is not go­ing to change a mi­grant worker’s life,” says Ms Swami­nathan. “What is more im­por­tant is the thought be­hind it. We want the mi­grant work­ers to know that there are peo­ple in this coun­try who care for them.”</p>
