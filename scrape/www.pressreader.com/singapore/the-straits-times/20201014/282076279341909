    <p>In­censed af­ter watch­ing a video of her younger brother be­ing as­saulted, a woman plot­ted re­venge on two peo­ple linked to the at­tack and poured hot wa­ter on the pair af­ter lur­ing them into her home.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the two vic­tims, Ms Nur Farahtika Omar, 27, and her brother, Mr Muham­mad Faizal Omar, 29, suf­fered sec­ond-de­gree burns on their bod­ies.</p>
    <p>The of­fender, Norhay­ati Jaf­far, 37, was sentenced to five years and four months’ jail yesterday af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count of as­sault­ing Mr Faizal with hot wa­ter.</p>
    <p>She also ad­mit­ted to three un­re­lated drug of­fences, in­clud­ing metham­phetamine con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Three other charges, in­clud­ing a sec­ond count of as­sault in­volv­ing Ms Farahtika, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Norhay­ati was the third and last per­son linked to the at­tack at Block 2 Spooner Road, near Jalan Bukit Merah, to be dealt with in court.</p>
    <p>Muham­mad Bakhti­yar Jaf­far, 35, was sentenced to 10 weeks’ jail ear­lier this year, while Nurhan­i­fah Juma’at, 28, was jailed for 15 months last year.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Norhay­ati was cel­e­brat­ing Hari Raya Aidil­fitri at her home on July 7, 2018, when a friend showed her a video of Mr Faizal and some of his rel­a­tives as­sault­ing one of Norhay­ati’s younger broth­ers, Mr Muham­mad Putera Shafiel­lah Jaf­far. The video also showed Ms Farahtika watch­ing the at­tack from nearby.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing re­venge, Norhay­ati in­vited Mr Faizal and Ms Farahtika to her flat, claim­ing that it was for a Hari Raya cel­e­bra­tion. Court doc­u­ments did not state how the vic­tims are re­lated to their at­tack­ers.</p>
    <p>Norhay­ati roped in Bakhti­yar, who is another of her younger broth­ers, and asked her friend Nurhan­i­fah to film the con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>Shortly be­fore their vic­tims ar­rived, Norhay­ati told Nurhan­i­fah to boil some wa­ter, and t he younger woman com­plied.</p>
    <p>Norhay­ati locked the front gate when Mr Faizal and Ms Farahtika ar­rived at around 12.30am on July 8, 2018. She and Bakhti­yar then as­saulted the pair while Nurhan­i­fah filmed the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Bjorn Tan said: “Dur­ing the ac­cused’s as­sault on Farahtika, she grabbed a jug of re­cently boiled hot wa­ter from the kitchen and poured the said hot wa­ter onto Farahtika’s neck, back and right ear.”</p>
    <p>Some­how, Ms Farahtika man­aged to flee from the flat, leav­ing her older brother be­hind.</p>
    <p>Norhay­ati and Bakhti­yar then rained blows on Mr Faizal be­fore Norhay­ati poured hot wa­ter on the left side of the vic­tim’s body.</p>
    <p>He sprang from the floor scream­ing in pain and ran out of the ground-floor flat via the back door.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Norhay­ati also ad­mit­ted to two drug con­sump­tion charges and one count of fail­ing to turn up for a urine test last year.</p>
    <p>In­censed af­ter watch­ing a video of her younger brother be­ing as­saulted, a woman plot­ted re­venge on two peo­ple linked to the at­tack and poured hot wa­ter on the pair af­ter lur­ing them into her home.</p>
