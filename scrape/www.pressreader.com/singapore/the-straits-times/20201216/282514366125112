    <p>Play­ing softball at Tan­jong Ka­tong Girls’ School made Ms Tan fall in love with the ca­ma­raderie of team sports.</p>
    <p>As part of the na­tional youth team for the sport, she was in­volved in in­ten­sive train­ing that pre­pared her for na­tional and in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she com­pleted her O lev­els, Ms Tan took a di­ploma and de­gree in fine arts at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts where she tried other sports such as fris­bee, yoga, box­ing and muay thai.</p>
    <p>The free­lance il­lus­tra­tor, who is also a fit­ness trainer at Level Gym, es­pe­cially en­joyed box­ing and muay thai. “There are many dif­fer­ent el­e­ments in the sports I en­joy. They chal­lenge and push me both phys­i­cally and men­tally. They give me a great adren­a­line and en­dor­phin rush,” she says.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they have since taken a back seat af­ter she tore mul­ti­ple lig­a­ments in her right knee due to wear and tear from muay thai, re­sult­ing in two op­er­a­tions last year.</p>
    <p>“Move­ment is a huge part of my life and los­ing that in the last year has crip­pled me in ways more than one. I am still re­cov­er­ing and try­ing to re­gain full func­tion of my knee.”</p>
    <p>She has em­barked on a new fit­ness jour­ney such as in­cor­po­rat­ing cal­is­then­ics – re­sis­tance train­ing ex­er­cises that use the per­son’s body weight – in her ex­er­cise rou­tine.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan says: “I’m not at</p>
    <p>100 per cent form yet, but I feel good with my progress. I have been dis­cov­er­ing new things about the things I can do through ex­er­cise such as pull-ups.”</p>
