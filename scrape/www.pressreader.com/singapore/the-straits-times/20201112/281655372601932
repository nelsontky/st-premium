    <p>The Chi­nese ef­fort for a Covid-19 vac­cine is heat­ing up, as sci­en­tists con­tinue to ad­min­is­ter ex­per­i­men­tal doses of treat­ment to thou­sands of peo­ple in China daily.</p>
    <p>Their ef­fort’s most re­cent chal­lenge is from Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Pfizer, which said early data on its Covid-19 vac­cine candidate sug­gests 90 per cent ef­fec­tive­ness in phase three clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms Si­no­vac Biotech, Sinopharm and CanSino Bi­o­log­ics have been car­ry­ing out phase three clin­i­cal tri­als out­side the coun­try, and also giv­ing out doses of the ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ment in their own coun­try.</p>
    <p>This, de­spite per­sis­tent con­cerns about the ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cines and the au­ton­omy of those re­ceiv­ing the ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ments in China.</p>
    <p>Most of them are work­ers in state-owned com­pa­nies and stu­dents plan­ning to go over­seas.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese state me­dia, shots of four ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines – made by the three com­pa­nies and in ur­gent use – have been ad­min­is­tered to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Sev­eral of us were anx­ious to get back to our project abroad so my su­per­vi­sor helped to rush the doc­tors to give us the shots ear­lier,” said an engi­neer who works at a state-owned en­ter­prise who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>“Many of us are wor­ried about the side ef­fects be­cause this is some­thing we don’t know any­thing about, but it felt in­cor­rect to ques­tion it at the com­pany... and all of us wanted to get back to work as soon as pos­si­ble,” he added.</p>
    <p>He is usu­ally based in a Mid­dle Eastern coun­try, but has had to stay put in Bei­jing since the pan­demic broke out early this year.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees at state-linked en­ter­prises said they were given a cock­tail of two sep­a­rate in­jec­tions, ad­min­is­tered sev­eral weeks apart.</p>
    <p>So far, about 100,000 peo­ple have been in­oc­u­lated with the Sinopharm vac­cine. None has re­acted badly to the treat­ment, said chair­man Liu Jingzhen last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>About 56,000 of them have trav­elled abroad and none has con­tracted the virus, he added, not­ing that they in­cluded em­ploy­ees of state-owned en­ter­prises China Na­tional Pe­tro­leum Cor­po­ra­tion and China Petro­chem­i­cal Cor­po­ra­tion and tech­nol­ogy gi­ant Huawei.</p>
    <p>Be­sides their own coun­try, the Chi­nese com­pa­nies are also do­ing clin­i­cal test­ing in dozens of other na­tions, such as In­done­sia, Brazil and Bahrain, be­cause there are too few coro­n­avirus cases in China for a large study.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s na­tional health reg­u­la­tor yes­ter­day al­lowed clin­i­cal tri­als of Si­no­vac’s Covid-19 vac­cine to re­sume, two days af­ter an “ad­verse in­ci­dent”.</p>
    <p>Public health of­fi­cials said the “ad­verse in­ci­dent” that led to the sus­pen­sion – a vol­un­teer re­cip­i­ent’s death, which po­lice are in­ves­ti­gat­ing as a sui­cide – had no con­nec­tion with the vac­cine, re­ported Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>China yes­ter­day re­ported two new cases, tak­ing the num­ber of ac­tive cases to 600. In all, the coun­try’s of­fi­cial tally is 92,304 cases.</p>
    <p>Phase three clin­i­cal tri­als are im­por­tant for vac­cines be­cause ad­verse side ef­fects usu­ally show up at this point in the ex­per­i­ments.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in eastern China’s Zhe­jiang prov­ince, thou­sands have payed 400 yuan (S$82) for an ex­per­i­men­tal dose.</p>
    <p>Ac­cess to the vac­cine will be for­mally ex­panded na­tion­wide to high-risk groups such as med­i­cal work­ers as early as next month, China’s Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion’s chief biosafety sci­en­tist Wu Guizhen told state tele­vi­sion last month.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties have cau­tioned that sup­ply is lim­ited. Pri­or­ity will be given to doc­tors and nurses, de­liv­ery work­ers, over­seas work­ers and oth­ers with spec­i­fied em­ploy­ment needs.</p>
