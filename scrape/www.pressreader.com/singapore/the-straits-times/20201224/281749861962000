    <p>WASH­ING­TON The new vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus that has be­come preva­lent i n Bri­tain i n re­cent weeks could be i n the United States un­de­tected, ac­cord­ing to the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC).</p>
    <p>No cases of the new strain have yet been found in the US, the CDC said on its web­site on Tues­day, but the agency said viruses have been se­quenced from only about 51,000 in­fec­tions so far, with the US pass­ing the grim mile­stone of 18 mil­lion cases on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est mil­lion cases were recorded in just six days, as US Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties cross 330,000, the most in the world.</p>
    <p>Many US states and cities have im­posed lock­downs and busi­ness clo­sures to try to get a han­dle on a wave of ill­ness driven by last month’s Thanks­giv­ing gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Travel between Bri­tain and the US, and the preva­lence of the strain in the for­mer boost the chance that it is al­ready in­fect­ing Amer­i­cans, the CDC said.</p>
    <p>Since last month, the strain has ac­counted for roughly 60 per cent of new coro­n­avirus cases in Lon­don, ac­cord­ing to the CDC.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists are work­ing to de­ter­mine whether the strain is more trans­mis­si­ble, the agency said, and if the cur­rently au­tho­rised vac­cines from Moderna and Pfizer/ BioNTech will pro­tect peo­ple against it.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans were warned again on Tues­day not to travel for Christ­mas as the lat­est Covid-19 surge left hos­pi­tals strug­gling to find beds for the sick, mak­ing for a grim hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, an epi­cen­tre of the lat­est surge in US cases, in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) beds were scarce and hos­pi­tals said they lacked enough doc­tors and nurses to care for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“The whole Cal­i­for­nia ICU ca­pac­ity has been go­ing down. We are all strug­gling,” said Dr Im­ran Mo­hammed of Sut­ter Ro­seville Med­i­cal Cen­tre, north of Sacra­mento.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally don’t want to see more than this. We will be chal­lenged to see fur­ther ICU pa­tients and we will have no place even­tu­ally.”</p>
    <p>The Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion said the pos­si­ble con­se­quences of a change in the virus’ struc­ture in­clude the abil­ity to spread more quickly, to cause ei­ther milder or more se­vere dis­ease, to elude screen­ing tests, to be less likely to be treated with ex­ist­ing drugs and to evade vac­cines.</p>
    <p>With Amer­i­cans al­ready weary from nine months of the pan­demic, top US of­fi­cials were re­port­edly con­sid­er­ing a ban on travel from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial that a new strain could evade the vac­cines caused shares of Pfizer, Moderna and other drug-mak­ers to de­cline on Tues­day, and worry that new quar­an­tines to con­tain the fresh mu­ta­tion could slow down the global re­cov­ery pres­sured stock mar­kets more broadly.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear, how­ever, whether phys­i­cal char­ac­ter­is­tics of the new vari­ant have led to that preva­lence, or if it is a by-prod­uct of peo­ple’s in­ter­ac­tions in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus mu­tates reg­u­larly, the CDC said, ac­quir­ing roughly one new mu­ta­tion in its</p>
    <p>genome ev­ery two weeks.</p>
    <p>The agency said the pos­si­ble con­se­quences of a change in the virus’ struc­ture in­clude the abil­ity to spread more quickly, to cause ei­ther milder or more se­vere dis­ease, to elude screen­ing tests, to be less likely to be treated with ex­ist­ing drugs and to evade vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter is the most trou­bling pos­si­bil­ity, the agency said.</p>
    <p>Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, head of US vac­cine pro­gramme Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, said on Mon­day that he ex­pected the cur­rent vac­cines would still of­fer pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>More than 600,000 Amer­i­cans had re­ceived their first Covid-19 vac­cine doses as at Mon­day, ac­cord­ing to the CDC. The first wave of shots has so far gone to health­care work­ers and nurs­ing home res</p>
    <p>idents, as well as some top gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, the US’ top in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist, also re­ceived the vac­cine on Mon­day, along with other se­nior of­fi­cials and six health work­ers at a livestream­ed event at the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US gov­ern­ment is set to pay Pfizer nearly US$2 bil­lion (S$2.7 bil­lion) for 100 mil­lion ad­di­tional doses of its Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The com­pany will de­liver at least 70 mil­lion doses by June 30 and the rest no later than July 31, Pfizer said yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of doses to 200 mil­lion for a to­tal price of about US$4 bil­lion.</p>
