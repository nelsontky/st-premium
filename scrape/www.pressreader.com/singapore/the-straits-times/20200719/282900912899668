    <p>Like many savvy in­vestors, en­trepreneur Vikas Na­hata is play­ing it safe amid the pan­demic and opt­ing for the tra­di­tion­ally most se­cure haven of all – gold.</p>
    <p>Mr Na­hata has directed 10 per cent of his port­fo­lio into the yel­low me­tal, not­ing that the price has shot up 15 per cent of late.</p>
    <p>“In the midst of a volatile mar­ket, I would main­tain a po­si­tion in gold, which is still seen as a safe haven for in­vest­ment,” he adds.</p>
    <p>But Mr Na­hata, co-founder and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Validus Cap­i­tal, is still in­vest­ing in his busi­ness – a fi­nanc­ing plat­form for small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) that has ex­panded into In­done­sia and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready put about $2 mil­lion of eq­uity into Validus Cap­i­tal and ex­pects it to break even in seven years.</p>
    <p>The firm, which has about 130 staff, is Sin­ga­pore’s largest peer-topeer lend­ing plat­form with $480 mil­lion or so al­ready dis­trib­uted.</p>
    <p>It helps firms ac­cess fi­nanc­ing from in­di­vid­ual and in­sti­tu­tional lenders, while us­ing tech­nol­ogy to min­imise the costs. “For Validus, with the strong suc­cess in Sin­ga­pore we have ex­pe­ri­enced, we have repli­cated in In­done­sia and Viet­nam and we’re on track to launch­ing our fourth en­tity in Thai­land by the end of this year,” says Mr Na­hata, 43.</p>
    <p>SME lend­ing through the plat­form still gives him good re­turns, while he con­tin­ues to keep a keen eye on his own in­vest­ments, en­sur­ing that they re­main diver­si­fied to weather these turbulent times.</p>
    <p>Mr Na­hata, who is mar­ried with a 17-year-old daugh­ter, grad­u­ated with a bach­e­lor of science in eco­nomics, with a fo­cus in strate­gic man­age­ment from the Univer­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia, the Whar­ton School, in 1998.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>A My port­fo­lio has gone through a tremen­dous change in re­cent times as with many oth­ers. What it was on Jan 1 and what it is to­day is com­pletely dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>My av­er­age port­fo­lio re­turn prior to the Covid-19 out­break was around 12 per cent.</p>
    <p>Apart from my in­vest­ments in each of my two busi­nesses, I cur­rently hold about 20 per cent in cash, in­vest about 15 per cent in SME lend­ing through the Validus plat­form, hold 15 per cent in equities, 10 per cent in gold and 40 per cent in fixed-in­come se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>While re­turns on equities and fixed in­come have been volatile, gold has gone up by about 15 per cent and SME lend­ing through Validus still gives me about 8 per cent to 9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A I in­tend to in­crease my ex­po­sure to reg­u­lated plat­form SME lend­ing (un­cor­re­lated to cur­rent mar­kets) which can of­fer me about 8 per cent to 9 per cent re­turns and also gold.</p>
    <p>I’ll be stay­ing liq­uid in cash and, as for equities and bonds, I’m go­ing to hold. I would like to in­vest again in equities by the end of the third quar­ter when there is more clar­ity on the im­pact across broader mar­kets.</p>
    <p>In the wake of the pan­demic, one should be care­ful about long-term in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A It hap­pened dur­ing my col­lege years at Whar­ton, where we were taught how to in­vest in pub­lic mar­kets. Af­ter grad­u­a­tion, I started work­ing and I took a por­tion of what I earned to in­vest in stock and later, bond mar­kets. Since then, I’ve been in­vest­ing for over 20 years.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A I lived by a cou­ple of rules, namely to di­ver­sify – it’s very im­por­tant espe­cially in times like now. Don’t try to time the mar­ket and don’t over-lever­age your port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Aim for con­sis­tent re­turns, while keep­ing cash in hand be­cause op­por­tu­ni­ties come once in ev­ery three years where you can re­ally make ab­nor­mal re­turns but if you don’t have cash, you don’t have the gun­pow­der to in­vest.</p>
    <p>Also, I do not in­vest di­rectly in real es­tate, start-ups, cryp­tocur­ren­cies or al­ter­na­tive eq­uity funds.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is I in­vest in my own ac­tive busi­nesses, which do carry risk. My per­sonal port­fo­lio is meant to be low risk and low re­turn.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan? A I have a life in­sur­ance plan and my daugh­ter is my ben­e­fi­ciary.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I plan to re­tire at age 50 and I would like to con­tinue work­ing and con­trib­ute my knowl­edge and skills as an ad­viser or men­tor. I ex­pect to earn about $300,000 a year in pas­sive in­come for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My dad is 67 and is still ac­tive in man­ag­ing our agri­cul­tural busi­ness in In­dia. My mum is 66 and she is an artist and pro­fes­sor. I have a younger sis­ter who is 35 years old.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily life­style was sim­plic­ity, which means dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing your needs and wants. It was very im­por­tant that we don’t spend more than we earn. Main­tain­ing a bal­anced life­style is cru­cial to cope with bad times when they come our way.</p>
    <p>Money has to be re­spected be­cause if you treat it with dis­re­spect, it will never stay with you. It doesn’t make you a more re­spected or in­flu­en­tial per­son. What you can do in this world with money and what you can help cre­ate is most im­por­tant, rather than how much you spend on lux­ury or things that you may not need.</p>
    <p>Don’t get tempted and swayed by what you see around you. That could be folks who spend a lot on brands, I don’t rec­om­mend you to try and im­i­tate that life­style. Stay true to what you be­lieve in, in terms of your spend­ing and spend­ing power.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, de-clut­ter­ing was a yearly ex­er­cise. We had to go through our wardrobes and take out at least 25 per cent of things that we didn’t need. This helped us to re-eval­u­ate how much we ac­tu­ally need.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A It means the power to cre­ate and make a dif­fer­ence. That’s why I started Validus. Some 80 per cent of SMEs, glob­ally and not just in Sin­ga­pore, are un­able to ac­cess bank lend­ing be­cause of col­lat­eral re­quire­ments and SMEs don’t have that.</p>
    <p>By build­ing Validus, we want to make life eas­ier for thou­sands of Sin­ga­porean en­trepreneur­s as well as to help them grow.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, there’s a $20 bil­lion gap in fi­nanc­ing and that’s what we’re fo­cus­ing on. The com­pa­nies we’ve loaned money to so far have grown rev­enues an­nu­ally by 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>We help both sides of the ta­ble – small busi­nesses who need money as well as in­vestors look­ing to park their funds in new and ex­cit­ing as­set classes. We want to cre­ate a win-win sit­u­a­tion for ev­ery­one in­volved.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now ...</p>
    <p>A Home is a rented apart­ment in Orchard. Hope­fully in the near fu­ture, I look for­ward to the pos­si­bil­ity of own­ing a home here.</p>
    <p>Q I drive ...</p>
    <p>A I don’t drive in Sin­ga­pore be­cause pub­lic trans­port is very con­ve­nient and I can al­ways rely on ride-hail­ing apps to take me from one des­ti­na­tion to an­other eas­ily.</p>
