    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions into the case of Dick­son Yeo, a Sin­ga­porean who pleaded guilty last Fri­day to act­ing under the di­rec­tion of Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials to ob­tain sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion from Amer­i­cans, have not re­vealed any di­rect threat to Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity, the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, an MHA spokesman added that the min­istry was i nformed by the United States au­thor­i­ties of the ar­rest of Yeo, 39, in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans are ex­pected to abide by the laws of the coun­try which they visit or re­side in,” said MHA.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Yeo’s school, the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy (LKYSPP), has ter­mi­nated his PhD can­di­da­ture “with im­me­di­ate ef­fect” in the light of in­for­ma­tion about him that has been re­leased by the US Depart­ment of Jus­tice, a spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Yeo en­rolled as a PhD stu­dent in LKYSPP’s public pol­icy pro­gramme in 2015, the school con­firmed. Last year, he ap­plied for, and was granted, leave of ab­sence.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan yes­ter­day said that Sin­ga­pore is ex­tend­ing con­sular as­sis­tance to Yeo.</p>
    <p>“He’s a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen. Our duty is to pro­vide con­sular as­sis­tance to him, ac­cord­ing to his needs,” said Dr Balakr­ish­nan, who was speak­ing to re­porters at the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity build­ing in Wood­lands, af­ter a meet­ing with his Malaysian coun­ter­part Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein.</p>
    <p>He added that he has no fur­ther in­for­ma­tion to share on Yeo’s case, be­yond what has been pub­lished.</p>
    <p>He did not com­ment when asked about ac­tions that Sin­ga­pore is tak­ing to de­tect and pre­vent such es­pi­onage agents from op­er­at­ing lo­cally and abroad.</p>
    <p>Yeo, whose birth name is Yeo Jun Wei, pleaded guilty in fed­eral court in Wash­ing­ton to one count of act­ing within the US as an il­le­gal for­eign agent.</p>
    <p>At LKYSPP, he re­searched China’s frame­work of treatment for small states along its Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive tra­jec­tory, ac­cord­ing to the school’s web­site.</p>
    <p>He was re­cruited in 2015 by Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives dur­ing a visit to Bei­jing, where he gave a pre­sen­ta­tion on the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in South-east Asia, court doc­u­ments showed.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment of facts sub­mit­ted to the court and signed by Yeo, he ad­mit­ted to be­ing fully aware that he was work­ing for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence, meet­ing agents dozens of times and be­ing given special treatment when he trav­elled to China.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments said that he used his po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy in the US, which was set up in 2018, as a front to col­lect in­for­ma­tion for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>He was tasked to spot and as­sess Amer­i­cans with ac­cess to valu­able non-public in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing Amer­i­can mil­i­tary and govern­ment em­ploy­ees with se­cu­rity clear­ance. He used var­i­ous so­cial me­dia sites to carry out his work.</p>
    <p>Yeo would pay them to write re­ports which he said were meant for clients in Asia, but which were in re­al­ity sent to the Chi­nese govern­ment with­out the writ­ers’ knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times spoke to a few peo­ple i n Sin­ga­pore who had known Yeo.</p>
    <p>They de­scribed him as an easy-go­ing per­son who was in­ter­ested in cur­rent and global af­fairs, and who fre­quently spoke of his con­tacts and con­nec­tions in China.</p>
    <p>An LKYSPP grad­u­ate who was en­rolled at the same time as Yeo said that Yeo, like most PhD stu­dents, had re­ceived a monthly stipend of about $2,000 from the school while do­ing his PhD. Yeo told him he started the con­sul­tancy as a way of sup­ple­ment­ing his in­come, he re­called.</p>
    <p>He added that Yeo had asked if he was keen to con­trib­ute to Yeo’s con­sul­tancy work, and of­fered to link him up with re­search in­sti­tutes under the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army if he needed to be hosted by an or­gan­i­sa­tion to con­duct field­work in China. He did not take Yeo up on both of­fers.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­liam Nguyen, 34, who was en­rolled in a Master of Public Pol­icy course at LKYSPP from 2016 to 2018, said Yeo had tried to con­tact him sev­eral times via Face­book af­ter June 2018, when Mr Nguyen made head­lines af­ter be­ing de­tained in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
    <p>The writer and democ­racy ac­tivist had joined protests against pro­posed special eco­nomic zones that pro­test­ers feared would re­sult in Chi­nese con­trol of Viet­namese ter­ri­tory, while he was on a visit to Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Mr Nguyen did not re­spond to Yeo’s mes­sages, he said, as he had never met or spo­ken to him be­fore.</p>
    <p>Dr Huang Jing, a former LKYSPP pro­fes­sor who was ex­pelled from the school af­ter the Govern­ment iden­ti­fied him as “an agent of in­flu­ence of a for­eign coun­try” in 2017, said Yeo was one of his PhD stu­dents. He added that he had not seen Yeo since around late 2016.</p>
    <p>“He is not shy and ap­pears hum­ble, that’s why peo­ple can feel relaxed with him around,” he said of Yeo. “I was shocked when another former stu­dent brought this news to me on Satur­day, and I am glad that he was caught.”</p>
