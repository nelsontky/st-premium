    <p>South Korea is grap­pling with a dou­ble whammy of ris­ing un­trace­able Covid-19 cases and a sud­den spike in crit­i­cally-ill pa­tients, as the to­tal tally of in­fec­tions crossed the 20,000-mark for the first time due to a new wave of cases.</p>
    <p>Once hailed as a role model for suc­cess­fully curb­ing the out­break with ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing and mas­sive test­ing, the coun­try is now strug­gling to cope with fresh cases.</p>
    <p>Over one-fifth of the cases re­ported in the past two weeks can­not be traced – the high­est to date, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion.</p>
    <p>This makes it harder for health of­fi­cials to carry out epi­demi­o­log­i­cal stud­ies and quar­an­tine close con­tacts who are pos­si­bly in­fected as well, to stop them from spread­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, four in 10 cases do not dis­play any symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said these un­known cases could be some­how linked to an Aug 15 rally in Gwangh­wa­mun Plaza in cen­tral Seoul, which has so far given rise to 422 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>About 50,000 peo­ple from all over the coun­try took part in the rally, but not all have gone for test­ing. Also, hun­dreds of mem­bers of the Sarang Jeil Church, which or­gan­ised the rally, re­main un­con­tactable.</p>
    <p>The church, which has over 4,000 mem­bers, has since re­ported 1,080 cases, in­clud­ing its pas­tor.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s cap­i­tal, Seoul, has or­dered bus-char­ter­ing ser­vices to start col­lect­ing pas­sen­ger data, as many of them ferry peo­ple go­ing for ral­lies and mass church events.</p>
    <p>The in­abil­ity to trace con­tacts may crip­ple the coun­try’s pre­pared­ness against Covid-19 at a time when its med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties are strain­ing to cope with the ris­ing num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 235 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal to 20,182. About a quar­ter of those cases emerged last month, tied to a new wave of in­fec­tions that sent daily fig­ures to more than 100 from Aug 14. The death toll stood at 324 as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have warned that the coun­try is run­ning short of med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als who can treat crit­i­cally ill pa­tients due to an in­def­i­nite strike by trainee doc­tors since Aug 21. They are protest­ing against plans by the govern­ment to re­form the health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is wor­ri­some as the num­ber of pa­tients in crit­i­cal con­di­tion has surged to 104 as of Mon­day – up from just nine on Aug 18. El­derly pa­tients aged 60 and above, many with un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions, ac­counted for over 30 per cent of the cases last week, said health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>As of now, only 43 beds are avail­able na­tion­wide to treat se­ri­ously ill pa­tients, in­clud­ing nine in Seoul.</p>
    <p>The oc­cu­pancy rate for hospi­tal beds set aside for pa­tients in Seoul and greater Seoul has reached 76 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Fi­nance Min­istry has warned that tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will hurt the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>New re­stric­tions that went into ef­fect on Sun­day, dubbed Level 2.5 in a three-tier sys­tem, in­clude the shut­ting down of pri­vate academies and in­door sports fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Cafe chains have also been or­dered to switch to take­aways and a 9pm limit im­posed for dine-in at all res­tau­rants to dis­cour­age so­cial gath­er­ings by young peo­ple who make up nearly 40 per cent of cases de­tected last week.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a brief­ing with se­nior of­fi­cials yes­ter­day Vice-Fi­nance Min­is­ter Kim Yong-beom promised that the govern­ment would strengthen sup­port mea­sures to help peo­ple cope with the eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>This could in­clude a se­cond round of emer­gency hand­outs – af­ter the govern­ment doled out “dis­as­ter re­lief funds” worth 14.3 tril­lion won (S$16.40 bil­lion) to all house­holds in May.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral bank data shows that South Korea’s econ­omy shrank by 3.2 per cent in the se­cond quar­ter – the sharpest con­trac­tion since 2008. Ex­ports have fallen for six con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple in the mean­time are tak­ing no chances, de­cid­ing to stay at home.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager John Lee, 32, told The Straits Times that he and his wife de­cided to self-quar­an­tine to­gether with their 14-month-old son af­ter re­turn­ing to Seoul from a short va­ca­tion to the east­ern Gang­won prov­ince last week. “We just stayed at home and or­dered food in,” said Mr Lee, who has been work­ing from home since March. “We used to eat out at nice res­tau­rants, but now, I just use the food de­liv­ery app.”</p>
