    <p>As­pir­ing elec­tri­cian Jeshua Tan, 19, can­not stop tin­ker­ing with old bus parts.</p>
    <p>His bed­room dou­bles as a work­shop and is strewn with tools and an ar­ray of “Bus Stop­ping” signs, des­ti­na­tion dis­plays and a re­mote­con­trolled coin box, picked up from scrap­yards and lov­ingly re­stored.</p>
    <p>“I started lik­ing buses when I was in Se­condary 2. I was just tak­ing buses, just chas­ing them. Later, I got more in­ter­ested in the tech­ni­cal side and that be­came my main fo­cus,” says the Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic elec­tri­cal and elec­tronic en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent.</p>
    <p>He finds it sat­is­fy­ing to see some­thing from his child­hood, like an old elec­tronic bus sign, sit­ting in his room. “Once it lights up, it’s nice and shiny and looks quite good.”</p>
    <p>In the early days of his hobby, he learnt how to re­pair bus parts by help­ing friends with elec­tri­cal tasks. He also vis­ited on­line en­gi­neer­ing fo­rums to un­der­stand how cir­cuits worked.</p>
    <p>The avid col­lec­tor has amassed nearly 1,000 bus parts, such as bus-stop­ping but­tons, steer­ing wheels, dash­board as­sem­blies and a fare card val­ida­tor.</p>
    <p>One of his most prized items is a 2m-long flip-dot dis­play, which leans against the wall of his room. The sign dates to the 1990s and was once in­stalled at the front of an SMRT bus, flash­ing mes­sages such as “MRT shut­tle” and “Merry X’mas & Happy New Yr”.</p>
    <p>He got it from a scrap­yard for about $150 and re­paired it him­self.</p>
    <p>“It’s electro­mechan­i­cal,” he says. “There’s a me­chan­i­cal disc, and when you send an elec­tric sig­nal to it, it flips to black or green. You don’t have to keep feed­ing it power for it to show a mes­sage.”</p>
    <p>His hobby has set him back by more than $5,000, but he re­coups some of this by help­ing friends with elec­tri­cal jobs. He also sells some of his mod­i­fied bus parts on on­line mar­ket­place Carousell. He con­verts “Bus Stop­ping” signs into USB de­vices so buy­ers can sim­ply plug them in with­out ex­tra work.</p>
    <p>“I can then use that profit to buy more items,” he says.</p>
