    <p>IN­JURY-HIT CITY NEED TO RE­COVER AT­TACK­ING BITE</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, Manch­ester City’s frag­ile de­fend­ing meant they were never re­ally in the ti­tle hunt, even if their at­tack­ing play re­mained a joy to watch.</p>
    <p>This cam­paign, Pep Guardi­ola’s side ap­pear to have lost their cut­ting edge up front as well, as ev­i­dent in a laboured first half at West Ham on Satur­day dur­ing which they man­aged only one shot on tar­get. The match ended 1-1.</p>
    <p>City are off to their worst start in six years and with Ser­gio Aguero suf­fer­ing an­other in­jury set­back and Gabriel Jesus still out, they look blunt up front.</p>
    <p>REDS ARE VUL­NER­A­BLE WITH­OUT VAN DIJK</p>
    <p>It is stat­ing the ob­vi­ous to say how much Liver­pool will miss in­jured cen­tre-back Vir­gil van Dijk but Satur­day’s nar­row 2-1 win over strug­gling Sh­effield United showed how much his ab­sence has desta­bilised Jur­gen Klopp’s side.</p>
    <p>The Reds did not de­fend badly against the Blades – the prob­lem was they had to do too much of it – whereas when the Dutch cap­tain is around, he sniffs out dan­ger be­fore it ma­te­ri­alises.</p>
    <p>With Fabinho dropping into de­fence from his usual deep-ly­ing mid­field po­si­tion, this al­lowed United to find a route to goal, and while the vis­i­tors could not make their 13 at­tempts count, a bet­ter op­po­nent will.</p>
    <p>SAINTS GO MARCH­ING ON UN­DER HASEN­HUTTL</p>
    <p>A year to the day since Southamp­ton were thrashed 9-0 by Le­ices­ter, Ralph Hasen­huttl’s side look a com­pletely trans­formed team as they kept a third clean sheet in their 2-0 win over league lead­ers Ever­ton to move up to sixth.</p>
    <p>The Saints are a team used to dropping points from win­ning po­si­tions but were as­sured in pos­ses­sion and cre­ated nu­mer­ous chances as they ended the Tof­fees’ record as the last re­main­ing un­beaten team this term.</p>
    <p>The club de­serve credit for see­ing the big pic­ture and stick­ing by the Aus­trian, who has man­aged to build an iden­tity with­out heavy in­vest­ment, which is the norm in the top flight.</p>
