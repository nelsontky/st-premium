    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Apart­ment own­ers on the premises of a lux­ury Mel­bourne ho­tel are seek­ing to quash plans by Aus­tralian Open or­gan­is­ers to use the ho­tel to quar­an­tine play­ers ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year.</p>
    <p>The apart­ment own­ers at the Westin Mel­bourne are con­cerned for their health and never agreed to in­ter­na­tional play­ers quar­an­tin­ing at the ho­tel, their lawyer Graeme Efron told Reuters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“My in­struc­tions are to get an in­junc­tion. So at this stage, that’s where we’re go­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Play­ers are ex­pected to ar­rive in the mid­dle of this month and un­dergo a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine as part of Covid-19 pro­to­cols be­fore the Feb 8-21 event.</p>
    <p>Efron said the Westin had in­formed the own­ers on Christ­mas Eve about the quar­an­tine plans for the post­poned tour­na­ment and pre­sented it as a “done deal”.</p>
    <p>“No one has told us that this has been man­dated by a govern­ment au­thor­ity to turn a partly res­i­den­tial city ho­tel into a quar­an­tine ho­tel,” he said.</p>
    <p>Own­ers, who in­clude top busi­ness peo­ple, added they felt “am­bushed” by the quar­an­tine plan.</p>
    <p>“At 84, I’m in the vul­ner­a­ble group and it’s shock­ing the way they tried to ram this through with­out any at­tempt to con­sult with us,” one of the own­ers, Digby Lewis, told Fair­fax me­dia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Westin man­age­ment claimed their “Covid-safe” plan had been shared with the own­ers cor­po­ra­tion, adding that res­i­dents would use a sep­a­rate en­trance and lifts, and have no con­tact with play­ers and quar­an­tine staff.</p>
    <p>“Their floor will re­main ex­clu­sive while there will be no retic­u­la­tion of ven­ti­la­tion be­tween the floors,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis Aus­tralia did not re­spond to a Reuters re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state, of which Mel­bourne is the cap­i­tal, recorded three new cases yes­ter­day, as au­thor­i­ties scram­bled to trace close con­tacts from an out­break that be­gan last month in Syd­ney’s North­ern Beaches area.</p>
    <p>At 84, I’m in the vul­ner­a­ble group and it’s shock­ing the way they tried to ram this through with­out any at­tempt to con­sult with us.</p>
    <p>DIGBY LEWIS, apart­ment owner at the Westin Mel­bourne, on plans to use the ho­tel as a quar­an­tine site.</p>
