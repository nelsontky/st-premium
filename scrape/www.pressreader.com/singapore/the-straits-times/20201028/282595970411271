    <p>Tai­wanese singer-host Alien Huang died from car­dio­vas­cu­lar com­pli­ca­tions, ac­cord­ing to the com­plete au­topsy re­port re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Huang, 36, was found dead at his home in Beitou district, Taipei, on Sept 16.</p>
    <p>There was spec­u­la­tion then that his death might have been due to a freak ac­ci­dent at home. His fa­ther had found him ly­ing half-dressed in the hall­way near the bath­room.</p>
    <p>Huang was pro­nounced dead by the paramedics who ar­rived at the scene. The po­lice did not find any drugs, wine bot­tles or signs of strug­gle on the premises.</p>
    <p>His man­ager said that ac­cord­ing to an au­topsy done on Sept 18, he had no ex­ter­nal in­juries and had died of an aor­tic dis­sec­tion, which led to a block­age of his blood ves­sels.</p>
    <p>Huang’s fa­ther was seen col­lect­ing the re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said he has no ob­jec­tion to the cause of his son’s death and was seen leav­ing af­ter col­lect­ing the death cer­tifi­cate.</p>
    <p>Huang’s body was cre­mated on Sept 25. A me­mo­rial, ti­tled The Most Ro­man­tic Con­cert On Earth, was held at con­cert venue Legacy Taipei on Oct 6.</p>
    <p>Out­door va­ri­ety show Mr Player, which fea­tured Huang and his co-hosts Jacky Wu and Kid Lin, aired the last episode fea­tur­ing Huang last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­ers paid tribute to Huang at the end of the show, in which he was seen walk­ing on the beach be­fore leav­ing in a space­ship.</p>
    <p>He could be heard say­ing “Thanks to ev­ery­body”, as though in­di­cat­ing he had com­pleted his mis­sion and was leav­ing earth.</p>
