    <p>Key mo­ments in Is­rael’s his­tory:</p>
    <p>CRE­ATION OF IS­RAEL</p>
    <p>Is­rael was formed on May 14, 1948, out of part of Pales­tine three years af­ter the end of World War II, when the Nazis killed more than six mil­lion Jews. It comes un­der at­tack by its Arab neigh­bours, but re­pels them. More than 760,000 Pales­tini­ans are driven out or flee, be­com­ing refugees.</p>
    <p>SUEZ CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>In 1956, Is­rael at­tacks Egypt along­side Bri­tain and France, which are seek­ing to over­turn the na­tion­al­i­sa­tion of the strate­gic Suez Canal. They even­tu­ally with­draw un­der pres­sure from the United States and the then Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>SIX-DAY WAR</p>
    <p>In June 1967, Is­rael wins a crush­ing vic­tory over its Arab neigh­bours in the Six-Day War. It seizes the West Bank – in­clud­ing East Jerusalem – from Jor­dan and the Golan Heights from Syria as well as the Gaza Strip and the Si­nai Penin­sula from Egypt.</p>
    <p>FIRST PEACE TREATY</p>
    <p>The year af­ter the his­toric 1977 visit to Jerusalem by Egypt’s pres­i­dent An­war Sa­dat, Is­rael and Egypt agree on peace terms af­ter US-bro­kered talks. The Camp David ac­cords are the first peace agree­ment be­tween Is­rael and an Arab state. The treaty is signed in 1979 by Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Me­nachem Be­gin and Mr Sa­dat.</p>
    <p>SEC­OND PEACE TREATY</p>
    <p>A sec­ond peace ac­cord, with Jor­dan, comes in 1994, signed by prime min­is­ters Yitzhak Rabin and Ab­del Salam Ma­jali.</p>
    <p>INTIFADAS</p>
    <p>The first Pales­tinian in­tifada, or up­ris­ing, erupts in 1987. It ends in 1993 when Is­rael agrees to lim­ited Pales­tinian au­ton­omy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an in­terim step to­wards a com­pre­hen­sive peace agree­ment, which has yet to emerge. The sec­ond in­tifada breaks out in 2000 when rightwing Is­raeli op­po­si­tion leader Ariel Sharon pays a provoca­tive visit to the Al-Aqsa mosque com­pound in an­nexed East Jerusalem.</p>
    <p>WITH­DRAWAL FROM GAZA</p>
    <p>In 2005, Is­rael with­draws all troops and set­tlers from Gaza af­ter 38 years of oc­cu­pa­tion. It im­poses a crip­pling block­ade af­ter Is­lamist group Ha­mas seizes con­trol in 2007. It car­ries out three deadly of­fen­sives against the ter­ri­tory in six years, the lat­est in 2014.</p>
    <p>TRUMP’S SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2017, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump recog­nises Jerusalem as Is­rael’s cap­i­tal. The dec­la­ra­tion is con­demned by the Pales­tini­ans, who re­gard East Jerusalem as the cap­i­tal of their fu­ture state.</p>
    <p>In May 2018, Wash­ing­ton trans­fers its em­bassy to Jerusalem.</p>
    <p>1981 ANNEXATION RECOG­NISED</p>
    <p>In March 2019, Mr Trump for­mally recog­nises Is­rael’s 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights.</p>
    <p>MID­DLE EAST PEACE PLAN</p>
    <p>On Jan 28, Mr Trump un­veils a con­tro­ver­sial Mid­dle East peace plan that paves the way for the annexation of swathes of the West Bank by Is­rael. On Aug 13, Mr Trump says Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates have reached a his­toric agree­ment to nor­malise ties. Un­der the deal, Is­rael agrees to “sus­pend” annexation of parts of the oc­cu­pied West Bank.</p>
    <p>On Sept 11, Mr Trump an­nounces Bahrain and Is­rael will also nor­malise re­la­tions. Within a month of the Sept 15 sign­ing of the ac­cords, Is­rael ap­proves plans for 4,948 more set­tler homes in the West Bank.</p>
