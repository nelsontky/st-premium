    <p>HAPPY BIRTH­DAY, FAN BING­BING: Chi­nese ac­tress Fan Bing­bing used to re­ceive adu­la­tion at the peak of her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>How­ever, since she got em­broiled in a tax-eva­sion scan­dal in 2018, sev­eral celebri­ties have kept their dis­tance as her ca­reer screeched to a halt. She had to cough up more than 800 mil­lion yuan (S$161 mil­lion) in over­due taxes and fines.</p>
    <p>Fan turned 39 on Wed­nes­day and she waited un­til about 11.45pm that day be­fore she posted three self­ies and wrote: “Love you for­ever. The 15 peo­ple who re­mem­ber (my birth­day).”</p>
    <p>Celebri­ties who sent their birth­day wishes on Weibo this year in­cluded Tai­wanese ac­tress Ja­nine Chang and Chi­nese ac­tor Dong Cheng­peng.</p>
    <p>It was a far cry from the avalanche of good wishes she used to get pre-scan­dal. Her birth­days were then trend­ing top­ics on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Last year, only Chang, 38, sent wishes on her spe­cial day.</p>
    <p>The two be­came good friends af­ter they starred in the 2014 Chi­nese tele­vi­sion se­rial, The Em­press Of China, which Fan also co-pro­duced.</p>
    <p>Fan and ac­tor Li Chen, an­other ac­tor on the se­rial, be­came a cou­ple af­ter film­ing ended. They broke off in June last year.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion was rife on Mon­day that Fan and Li have rec­on­ciled af­ter pho­tos of a light dis­play by drones spell­ing out the words FBB, Happy Birth­day and I Love Big Black Ox were cir­cu­lated on the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens be­lieved they were sent by Li, as his nick­name was “Big Black Ox” and that FBB stood for Fan Bing­bing.</p>
