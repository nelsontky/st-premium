    <p>HONG KONG • Rel­a­tives and sup­port­ers of 12 Hongkonger­s, de­tained in China af­ter try­ing to flee the city by speed­boat, protested yes­ter­day on an is­land near the Chi­nese prison where they have been held vir­tu­ally in­com­mu­ni­cado for nearly three months.</p>
    <p>The 11 men and one woman were cap­tured by the Chi­nese coast­guard on Aug 23 aboard a speed­boat be­lieved to have been bound for Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>All faced charges linked to the protest move­ment em­broil­ing Hong Kong, in­clud­ing ri­ot­ing and vi­o­la­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law China im­posed on June 30.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily mem­bers and sup­port­ers of some of the 12 hiked to the peak of Kat O is­land in Hong Kong’s re­mote north-eastern reaches, over­look­ing China’s high-tech boom­town of Shen­zhen, and the Yan­tian district where the dozen are be­ing held.</p>
    <p>Some peered through binoc­u­lars at a hill where the de­ten­tion cen­tre is lo­cated. Sev­eral told Reuters that they want the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to deal with the cases in a fair and trans­par­ent man­ner.</p>
    <p>The group in­flated blue and white bal­loons and wrote the names of the de­tainees on them, be­fore re­leas­ing them into the sky. They chanted for their “im­me­di­ate safe re­turn”.</p>
    <p>“I hope he can see the bal­loons and know we haven’t given up yet,” said the 28-year-old wife of de­tainee Wong Wai Yin.</p>
    <p>A Hong Kong marine po­lice ves­sel later docked on the is­land, with po­lice ques­tion­ing and tak­ing down the de­tails of sev­eral re­porters present.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have de­nied fam­ily and lawyers ac­cess to the 12, in­sist­ing they be rep­re­sented by of­fi­cially ap­pointed lawyers.</p>
    <p>Last week, seven de­tainees wrote hand­writ­ten let­ters to their fam­i­lies, but the group said in a state­ment that “they seem to have been com­piled un­der duress”.</p>
    <p>Ed­die Chu, a for­mer law­maker who re­cently quit his post in protest against po­lit­i­cal sup­pres­sion by the au­thor­i­ties un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law, said it was im­por­tant to keep fight­ing.</p>
