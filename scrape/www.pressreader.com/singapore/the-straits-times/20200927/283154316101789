    <p>If you are in your 30s, you prob­a­bly spend a lot of time think­ing about how to ex­cel in your ca­reer and make more money so that you and your fam­ily can have a bet­ter life.</p>
    <p>The last thing on your mind would be how you would man­age when you are old, frail, in a wheel­chair and need help to even go to the toi­let.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, you are in the prime of your adult­hood, and the idea of be­ing old and need­ing help for ba­sic life ne­ces­si­ties seems such a re­mote pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>So it is not sur­pris­ing to find quite a num­ber of folks ex­press­ing their in­dig­na­tion in on­line fo­rums about be­ing made to sign up for the longterm care in­sur­ance scheme, CareShield Life, which will be­come com­pul­sory from Oct 1 for those who are 40 or younger this year.</p>
    <p>But the re­al­ity is that fi­nan­cial plan­ning is about look­ing ahead and see­ing what we can do to re­tire well, and not just look­ing at the present.</p>
    <p>While CareShield Life cov­ers se­vere dis­abil­ity of­ten as­so­ci­ated with old age, it also pro­vides for younger pa­tients who are un­able to take care of them­selves as a re­sult of ac­ci­dents or de­bil­i­tat­ing ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for pay­outs, a claimant must have an ac­cred­ited doc­tor or asses­sor cer­tify that he is un­able to per­form at least three of the six ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing on his own.</p>
    <p>Th­ese tasks are the abil­ity to take a bath or shower, put on and take off clothes, eat, use the toi­let, walk or move around, and trans­fer to a chair, bed or wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>I did not see my­self fac­ing such con­di­tions when the non-com­pul­sory ElderShiel­d was launched in 2002, when I was in my 30s.</p>
    <p>I opted not to sign up then be­cause the thought of be­ing un­able to do ba­sic ev­ery­day ac­tiv­i­ties such as tak­ing a shower, go­ing to the wash­room and walk­ing around on my own seemed very un­real at the time.</p>
    <p>ElderShiel­d first pro­vided a $300 monthly pay­out for five years. The sum was later in­creased to $400 for six years. I told my­self that I should be able to save enough for re­tire­ment, and thus would not need that ex­tra pay­ment even if I ended up in that state.</p>
    <p>Now that I am 18 years older, my</p>
    <p>per­spec­tives on life, health­care and re­tire­ment plan­ning have changed com­pletely. CareShield Life, which re­places the pre­vi­ous scheme, no longer sounds ir­rel­e­vant to me.</p>
    <p>Af­ter wit­ness­ing the age­ing cy­cle of older rel­a­tives, it has be­come clear to me that need­ing help in old age is no longer an alien con­cept; it is not whether, but at what age, you will be in this con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>That said, be­ing in such a con­di­tion does not mean the end of life. You can still en­joy more good years – it is just that you will need some­one to help you so that you do not fall over in the bath­room and ac­cel­er­ate your jour­ney to the next world.</p>
    <p>This is pre­cisely what CareShield Life seeks to cover you for. Its monthly pay­out of $600, which will go up grad­u­ally through the years to off­set in­fla­tion, will help to pay for or sub­sidise the ser­vice fees of a live-in care­giver.</p>
    <p>And un­like the pay­ment un­der ElderShiel­d, which would end af­ter six years, the pay­out un­der the new scheme is for life, once a suc­cess­ful claim is made.</p>
    <p>Not the only life plan­ning scheme</p>
    <p>Do not be lulled into think­ing that just be­cause it is com­pul­sory for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of young peo­ple when they hit 30 that this scheme will take care of ev­ery­thing for life.</p>
    <p>As CareShield Life cov­ers a very spe­cific area of se­vere dis­abil­ity, it is but one health­care and re­tire­ment plan­ning scheme made avail­able to Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>It aims to sup­ple­ment another com­pul­sory scheme, MediShield Life, which cov­ers the ba­sic hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and med­i­cal care needs of all Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Those who want more com­pre­hen­sive health­care cov­er­age can choose to sign up for an In­te­grated Shield Plan of­fered by a pri­vate in­surer so that they are cov­ered for treat­ment in pri­vate hos­pi­tals and stays in higher-class wards.</p>
    <p>But un­like th­ese health in­sur­ance poli­cies, which re­quire pre­mium pay­ments an­nu­ally as long as you need the cov­er­age, pre­mium pay­ments for CareShield Life will cease at 67, or when a suc­cess­ful claim is made ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Then there is the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Life, the main re­tire­ment scheme that pro­vides all Sin­ga­pore­ans with life­long monthly pay­outs from the age of 65, re­gard­less of their health con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­like the CareShield Life pay­out, which is de­ter­mined by the scheme’s in­de­pen­dent coun­cil, the monthly pay­out for CPF Life is de­cided by the re­cip­i­ent, based on the to­tal re­tire­ment sum set aside at 55.</p>
    <p>So if you set aside only the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum, which is $90,500 this year, you will re­ceive about $800 a month. But if you set aside the En­hanced Re­tire­ment Sum of $271,500, you can re­ceive al­most $2,200 a month.</p>
    <p>More money in old age is bet­ter</p>
    <p>This begs the ques­tion: Does some­one in his 30s who plans to save for the max­i­mum re­tire­ment sum for CPF Life, which will pro­vide more than $2,200 a month from 65, still need the CareShield Life pay­out, which is con­sid­er­ably lower?</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that no per­son who be­comes an in­valid and is un­able to take care of him­self will com­plain about re­ceiv­ing another fixed monthly pay­ment.</p>
    <p>So the CareShield Life pay­out can be used to pay for a care­giver while the CPF Life pay­out can be used for other liv­ing ex­penses such as food and util­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This is prob­a­bly why the Gov­ern­ment has made it com­pul­sory for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans to start con­tribut­ing to CareShield Life from 30.</p>
    <p>As the av­er­age longevity of Sin­ga­pore­ans in­creases, the risk of be­com­ing an in­valid in old age be­comes higher. Thus, hav­ing a care­giver may be­come a ne­ces­sity and is no longer a lux­ury.</p>
    <p>Peace of mind</p>
    <p>As with all in­sur­ance poli­cies, the ben­e­fit of start­ing early is that the pre­mi­ums payable are usu­ally lower at the be­gin­ning. The full amount can be paid us­ing funds from the CPF Medis­ave ac­count.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, pre­mi­ums for 30-year-olds start at $206 a year for men and $253 for women.</p>
    <p>Those who are older can check how much they need to pay by us­ing the pre­mium cal­cu­la­tor at careshield­life.gov.sg</p>
    <p>For those who have been dili­gent in con­tribut­ing to their Medis­ave, chances are that the yearly in­ter­est of 4 per cent that they re­ceive for their Medis­ave funds should be suf­fi­cient to pay for the CareShield Life pre­mium.</p>
    <p>Those in lower in­come groups can ex­pect to get gen­er­ous sub­si­dies as well as sup­port to pay for their pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, for those who are still un­con­vinced of the need for CareShield Life, try to look at this as if you are buy­ing travel in­sur­ance, since most Sin­ga­pore­ans like to travel.</p>
    <p>No one buys such in­sur­ance with the hope of be­ing in­volved in a plane crash or be­ing hit by a lorry dur­ing a hol­i­day. But should calamity strike over­seas, it is good to know you have the op­tion of be­ing flown back home in a spe­cial air am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>The ra­tio­nale is the same for CareShield Life as you jour­ney through life.</p>
    <p>Be happy if you can avoid mak­ing a claim even when you reach the end of your jour­ney.</p>
    <p>But if you need to, at least you know that you will be cared for up to the end.</p>
