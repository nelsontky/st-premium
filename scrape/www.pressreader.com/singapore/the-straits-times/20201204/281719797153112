    <p>•</p>
    <p>ROME/BER­LIN Sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries have tight­ened the move­ment of peo­ple to curb a resur­gence of Covid-19 ahead of Christ­mas and New Year.</p>
    <p>Italy, the Euro­pean coun­try first hit by the pan­demic, yes­ter­day an­nounced na­tional travel re­stric­tions for the Christ­mas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The new rules, to­gether with an ex­ist­ing cur­few and other reg­u­la­tions al­ready in place, seek to curb cir­cu­la­tion through­out the coun­try dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod by lim­it­ing the num­ber of gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Ital­ians will not be able to at­tend mid­night mass on Christ­mas Eve and will be only al­lowed to move be­tween re­gions in emer­gen­cies over the hol­i­day pe­riod start­ing from Dec 20.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment de­cree also in­cludes the “strong rec­om­men­da­tion” to avoid host­ing those who do not live to­gether.</p>
    <p>Other rules in­clude a 10-day quar­an­tine for those ar­riv­ing in Italy from for­eign coun­tries, be­gin­ning on Dec 20.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Health Min­is­ter Roberto Sper­anza told Par­lia­ment: “If we let down our guard now, the third wave is just around the cor­ner.”</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said the coun­try will ex­tend its par­tial lock­down by three more weeks into next year as offi</p>
    <p>cials strug­gle to re­gain con­trol of the coro­n­avirus spread.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants and bars, along with cul­tural and sport­ing fa­cil­i­ties, will re­main closed un­til Jan 10 and the gov­ern­ment will re­con­vene with re­gional lead­ers on Jan 4 to re­assess the re­stric­tions, Dr Merkel said late on Wed­nes­day, af­ter talks with the pre­miers of the coun­try’s 16 states.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas mar­kets, a cher­ished tra­di­tion, have been can­celled in many places in Ger­many. Dres­den’s sprawl­ing Christkind­les­markt, one of Ger­many’s best­known hol­i­day mar­kets, was one of those which had been called off.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s in­fec­tion rates are still far too high and need to come down faster, she said in Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>“We have to be­moan a very high num­ber of deaths ev­ery day, which shows the amount of re­spon­si­bil­ity that we have.”</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel’s ad­min­is­tra­tion last week ex­tended the par­tial shut­down un­til Dec 20 while keep­ing schools and much of the econ­omy open. The so-called “lock­down light” has yielded lit­tle progress in slow­ing the spread of Covid-19 to lev­els the gov­ern­ment has de­ter­mined as man­age­able.</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor Merkel on Wed­nes­day re­it­er­ated that the seven-day in­ci­dence per 100,000 cit­i­zens needs to come down to around 50 – and stay there – be­fore re­stric­tions can be loos­ened. It was un­changed at 134 yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est data from Ger­many’s Robert Koch In­sti­tute for in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>France, which im­posed tougher re­stric­tions, is now cau­tiously mov­ing to loosen curbs ahead of the Christ­mas hol­i­days. But Stras­bourg’s pop­u­lar Christ­mas mar­ket will no t go up this year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the four na­tions of the United King­dom – Eng­land, Scot­land, Wales and North­ern Ire­land – have agreed to re­lax Covid-19 curbs for Christ­mas to al­low up to three house­holds to meet at home from Dec 23 to 27, also let­ting them meet in places of wor­ship and in out­door pub­lic places but not at in­door hos­pi­tal­ity or en­ter­tain­ment venues.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain on Wed­nes­day be­came the first coun­try to ap­prove the vaccine can­di­date de­vel­oped by Ger­many’s BioNTech and Pfizer, jump­ing ahead of the rest of the world in the race to be­gin a cru­cial mass in­oc­u­la­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>In Spain, the gov­ern­ment agreed with the re­gional au­thor­i­ties that a max­i­mum of 10 peo­ple per house­hold will be al­lowed to gather for the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­days to avoid spread­ing the coro­n­avirus, Health Min­is­ter Sal­vador Illa said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment, which ap­plies to cel­e­bra­tions on Christ­mas Eve, Christ­mas, New Year’s Eve and on New Year’s Day, means a slight re­lax­ation of the cur­rent gen­eral rule that al­lows gath­er­ings of up to six peo­ple, ex­cept in some re­gions that have de­fined their own lim­its.</p>
    <p>Move­ment of peo­ple be­tween re­gions will be banned be­tween Dec 23 and Jan 6, ex­cept for vis­its to fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Illa did not ex­plain how this would work out or be mon­i­tored – pos­si­bly a tough task con­sid­er­ing how many peo­ple travel at Christ­mas pre­cisely to be with fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“It is de­sir­able that peo­ple re­strict their mo­bil­ity and so­cial con­tacts as much as pos­si­ble,” Mr Illa said, en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple not to move de­spite the loop­holes.</p>
    <p>“To sum it up, this Christ­mas we stay at home.”</p>
    <p>THIRD WAVE LURKS</p>
    <p>If we let down our guard now, the third wave is just around the cor­ner.</p>
    <p>MR ROBERTO SPER­ANZA, Italy’s Health Min­is­ter, said in Par­lia­ment.</p>
