    <p>A de­pressed mother stran­gled her five-year-old son at home be­fore fa­tally stab­bing her­self near Bukit Timah Na­ture Re­serve, a coroner’s in­quiry has found.</p>
    <p>The boy was autis­tic and had at­ten­tion deficit hy­per­ac­tiv­ity disorder, and Ja­panese na­tional Nami Ogata, 41, was stressed about him. She also told doc­tors she could not cope with work and caring for her two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Madam Nami left a sui­cide note ad­dressed to her hus­band, apol­o­gis­ing for her ac­tions and telling him to take care of their younger son. She then drove to Lorong Se­suai to take her own life, bring­ing her son’s body with her.</p>
    <p>State Coroner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam ruled Madam Nami’s death to be a “de­lib­er­ate act of sui­cide” and her son’s death to be an “un­law­ful killing at the hands of his mother” in her find­ings which were made avail­able yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The find­ings state that Madam Nami had sought med­i­cal at­ten­tion for her low mood and anx­i­ety, and had told a psy­chi­a­trist about her sui­ci­dal thoughts and feel­ings of de­pres­sion at least three days be­fore the fa­tal in­ci­dent on Nov 14 last year.</p>
    <p>She told the doc­tor she had been anx­ious for the past few months and had been sleep­ing badly. She also had loss of ap­petite, weight and hair, and had pal­pi­ta­tions for about a week.</p>
    <p>She told the psy­chi­a­trist she was stressed about her son So­taro, with­out re­veal­ing the ex­act rea­sons, the coroner found.</p>
    <p>Madam Nami was im­me­di­ately re­ferred to the emer­gency medicine depart­ment at Singapore Gen­eral Hospi­tal, where she de­nied be­ing ac­tively sui­ci­dal but said she had been feel­ing de­pressed for a year.</p>
    <p>She was dis­charged with drugs to treat her in­som­nia and was to be re­viewed by her pri­vate psy­chi­a­trist the next day.</p>
    <p>Madam Nami sub­se­quently told her pri­vate psy­chi­a­trist that she “would not harm her­self on ac­count of her chil­dren”, even though she had “one tran­sient, short episode of think­ing of end­ing her life a week prior”, stated the coroner’s re­port.</p>
    <p>She was di­ag­nosed with ma­jor de­pres­sive disorder and given an­tide­pres­sants and a tran­quil­liser.</p>
    <p>Madam Nami wrote in her sui­cide note that the med­i­ca­tion did not work and told her hus­band “she was go­ing to take So­taro” with her.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band had left Singapore for a busi­ness trip to China on Oct 30 and had not sensed any­thing un­usual when he last spoke to her on Nov 10, ac­cord­ing to the coroner.</p>
    <p>Madam Nami also wrote to her brother, plead­ing with him to raise her younger son to­gether with his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to her maid, on the night of Nov 13, Madam Nami read sto­ry­books to her chil­dren until they fell asleep. She later texted the maid to tell her that she had taken So­taro to the hospi­tal as he was “hav­ing a fever”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that Madam Nami had likely stran­gled So­taro in the liv­ing room us­ing a long elas­tic band and raf­fia string.</p>
    <p>Around 5.40am, she drove out, with her son’s body cov­ered in a white blan­ket, to Lorong Se­suai.</p>
    <p>The two were pro­nounced dead at the scene by paramedics.</p>
