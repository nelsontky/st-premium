    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • In j ust a few hours, Zoom Video Com­mu­ni­ca­tions chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Eric Yuan be­came US$4.2 bil­lion (S$5.7 bil­lion) richer.</p>
    <p>Shares of his vir­tual-meet­ing com­pany surged as much as 26 per cent to US$410 in late US trad­ing on Mon­day, as it re­ported a jump in quar­terly rev­enue and sug­gested the ex­plo­sive growth will con­tinue. Should the stock main­tain such a gain yes­ter­day, Mr Yuan’s for­tune would sur­pass US$20 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>So far, this year has been filled with eye-pop­ping ral­lies for the rich­est names in the tech world – Ama­zon.com’s Jeff Be­zos saw his net worth grow by US$13 bil­lion in one day in July, and Tesla’s Elon Musk added US$8 bil­lion in 24 hours last month. Both men have reached record lev­els of wealth, with Mr Be­zos cross­ing US$200 bil­lion and Mr Musk sur­pass­ing US$100 bil­lion last week.</p>
    <p>Zoom has been one of the clear­est ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with busi­nesses and ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions turn­ing to the ser­vice to work and teach re­motely.</p>
    <p>The soft­ware maker re­ported on Mon­day that sales jumped 355 per cent to US$663.5 mil­lion in the three months through July 31 – the se­cond-largest surge among Nas­daq 100 Index mem­bers last quar­ter, only be­hind biotech firm Moderna, data com­piled by Bloomberg shows. Zoom said sales will be as much as US$2.39 bil­lion in the fis­cal year end­ing in Jan­uary, mean­ing rev­enue would al­most quadru­ple in just one year.</p>
    <p>The founder of the San Jose, Cal­i­for­nia-based com­pany, whose net worth is mostly made up of his more than 50 mil­lion Zoom shares, is one of the big­gest gain­ers this year. Mr Yuan, 50, was US$12.8 bil­lion richer as of the Mon­day close as the stock surged al­most five­fold.</p>
    <p>Early Zoom in­vestors Li Ka Shing and Sa­muel Chen are also get­ting a wealth boost from the rally. As­sum­ing both men still hold the stock, Mr Li could be adding US$2 bil­lion in one day and Mr Chen more than US$650 mil­lion should Zoom shares reach US$410 at the next close, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires Index.</p>
    <p>The soft­ware maker re­ported on Mon­day that sales jumped 355 per cent to US$663.5 mil­lion in the three months through July 31 – the se­cond-largest surge among Nas­daq 100 Index mem­bers last quar­ter.</p>
