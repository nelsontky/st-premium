    <p>HE­SI­TAT­ING TO JOIN POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>“In 1974, when the Chair­man of PAP, Dr Toh Chin Chye, first broached the idea of my en­ter­ing pol­i­tics, I de­murred and said that I was not ready.</p>
    <p>“Later, in 1979, when Goh Chok Tong, through S. Dhan­a­balan, asked me to stand in the next Gen­eral Elec­tion, my first re­sponse was that I pre­ferred to con­tinue teach­ing law at the univer­sity. But they asked me this ques­tion: “Sup­pos­ing you are on the top of our list, and if you say no, and we have to go down the list and every­body else keeps say­ing no. We then go to the bot­tom of the list and then later, would you re­gret it if things went awry in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>“When it was put in that way, I found it very dif­fi­cult to refuse.”</p>
    <p>THE LEE FAM­ILY DIS­PUTE</p>
    <p>“I have noth­ing against them per­son­ally. I was, how­ever, as­ton­ished by the sib­lings’ dras­tic ac­tions. Surely they must have known that their at­tacks on PM Lee would harm not only his rep­u­ta­tion but would also cause great dam­age to Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion. It would also sully the legacy of their fa­ther, who was the found­ing fa­ther of mod­ern Sin­ga­pore... What the sib­lings did came across as an open dec­la­ra­tion of war.”</p>
    <p>THE OP­PO­SI­TION</p>
    <p>“A few days af­ter GE 2020, on 15 July 2020, I emailed this view to a Cabi­net min­is­ter: ‘We should not be be­guiled by WP’s stance that they only want to check the Gov­ern­ment. This time their line was to pre­vent a clean sweep of all seats.</p>
    <p>‘At the next GE – their aim will be to pre­vent PAP hav­ing a two-thirds ma­jor­ity. Fur­ther down the road, we should not rule out them (in con­cert with other op­po­si­tion par­ties) try­ing to pre­vent PAP win­ning a ma­jor­ity of seats. They will do so if they have enough winnable can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>‘As I see it, the camel has got­ten its nose into the PAP tent. It will want to oc­cupy the whole tent in 2, 3 or 4 elec­tions down the road.’”</p>
