    <p>BRUS­SELS • Nato al­lies have agreed that Rus­sia must co­op­er­ate with an in­ter­na­tional probe into the poi­son­ing of op­po­si­tion l eader Alexei Navalny, the al­liance’s chief said.</p>
    <p>Ger­many, where Mr Navalny is in hos­pi­tal, has said he was poi­soned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has un­til now not opened a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion. Rus­sian In­te­rior Min­is­ter Vladimir Kolokolt­sev said yes­ter­day he saw no grounds for now to sus­pect a crime was com­mit­ted in the case of Mr Navalny, the In­ter­fax news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The North At­lantic Treaty Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral Jens Stoltenber­g told a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day: “Nato al­lies agree that Rus­sia now has se­ri­ous ques­tions it must an­swer.”</p>
    <p>“The Rus­sian gov­ern­ment must fully co­op­er­ate with the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for the Pro­hi­bi­tion of Chem­i­cal Weapons on an im­par­tial in­ter­na­tional in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” he said, re­port­ing back from a meet­ing of the al­liance’s am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, 44, is the most pop­u­lar and prom­i­nent op­po­nent of Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, and the Ger­man an­nounce­ment this week that he was poi­soned by a nerve agent has raised the pos­si­bil­ity of fur­ther West­ern sanc­tions against Moscow.</p>
    <p>Mr Stoltenber­g said: “Those re­spon­si­ble for this at­tack must be held ac­count­able and brought to jus­tice. Time and again, we have seen op­po­si­tion lead­ers and crit­ics of the</p>
    <p>Rus­sian regime at­tacked and their lives threat­ened. Some have even been killed.”</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union will likely im­pose new sanc­tions on Moscow over the poi­son­ing of Mr Navalny, but not straight­away, to give time to un­cover the cul­prits, ac­cord­ing to the bloc’s ex­ec­u­tive and diplo­matic sources. Euro­pean Com­mis­sion spokesman Peter Stano said Rus­sia needed to carry out a cred­i­ble, in­de­pen­dent probe and the bloc would re­act based on Moscow’s next steps.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin said yes­ter­day that it wanted dia­logue with Ger­many over Mr Navalny and that Rus­sian doc­tors who treated him ini­tially were much more trans­par­ent than the Ger­man doc­tors treat­ing him now.</p>
    <p>A Rus­sian tox­i­col­o­gist said yes­ter­day that Mr Navalny’s health could have de­te­ri­o­rated due to di­et­ing, stress or fa­tigue, in­sist­ing no poi­son had been found in his sam­ples in Siberia.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny fell ill on a flight last month and was treated for two days in a clinic in the Siberian city of Omsk be­fore be­ing evac­u­ated to Ger­many.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment by the Omsk re­gional au­thor­i­ties, chief re­gional tox­i­col­o­gist Alexan­der Sabayev said Mr Navalny had suf­fered from stom­ach prob­lems be­fore he fell ill.</p>
    <p>“The pa­tient used di­ets to lose weight,” Mr Sabayev told re­porters.</p>
