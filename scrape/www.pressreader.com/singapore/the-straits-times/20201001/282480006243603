    <p>Amer­i­can writer and pro­ducer Dar­ren Star is responsibl­e for some of the most pop­u­lar, zeit­geist-defin­ing and fash­ion­able tele­vi­sion shows of the last two decades.</p>
    <p>There was Sex And The City (1998 to 2004), his ode to sin­gle women and fe­male friend­ship; the iconic teenage drama Bev­erly Hills 90210 (1990 to 2000); and the hit prime-time soap opera Mel­rose Place (1992 to 1999).</p>
    <p>So there is much an­tic­i­pa­tion ahead of his new­est se­ries, Emily In Paris, which pre­mieres on Net­flix to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>It stars Lily Collins (Love, Rosie, 2014) as an am­bi­tious young Amer­i­can ex­pa­tri­ate who lands her dream job in the French cap­i­tal, only to find her ebul­lience – and ca­reer and love life – damp­ened by the cul­ture clash.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times and other press by video call re­cently, Star ex­plained how he is able to write all th­ese hit fe­male-cen­tric shows.</p>
    <p>1 CHAR­AC­TERS ARE TRUE TO LIFE</p>
    <p>Star is in­spired by the women in his life: Asked how he is able to chan­nel the fe­male psy­che in so many of his char­ac­ters, the 59-year-old says: “It def­i­nitely comes from the fe­male friend­ships I have in my life: the women I grew up with – my mother, my sis­ter – and a lot of re­ally strong fe­male friend­ships.</p>
    <p>“But be­yond that, I re­ally don’t think of th­ese char­ac­ters from a par­tic­u­larly fe­male point of view – I think of them as sort of from my own point of view. And I project my­self into their shoes and imag­ine their is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Collins, 31, has long been “en­am­oured of the way Dar­ren writes fe­male char­ac­ters”.</p>
    <p>For Emily In Paris, Star drew not just on peo­ple in his life but also the ex­pe­ri­ence of liv­ing in France while shoot­ing the se­ries in Paris and the French coun­try­side.</p>
    <p>“You can feel the per­son­al­ity and the gen­uine na­ture of each of the char­ac­ters he writes be­cause they’re based partly in re­al­ity,” Collins says.</p>
    <p>“And Dar­ren and the rest of the team wrote the ma­jor­ity of the episodes while liv­ing in Paris with us. So all the char­ac­ters were writ­ten in the place they’re liv­ing and breath­ing in.”</p>
    <p>2 WORLD OF STRONG, EM­POW­ERED WOMEN</p>
    <p>He prefers writ­ing fe­male char­ac­ters: “Men and women share, I think, a lot of univer­sal feel­ings but, at the same time, I find women re­ally fun to write,” re­veals Star, who also cre­ated Younger (2015 to 2019) – a com­edy se­ries about a 40some­thing who restarts her ca­reer by pre­tend­ing to be in her 20s.</p>
    <p>He es­pe­cially loves how ex­pres­sive women are when it comes to their emo­tions.</p>
    <p>“For some­body that likes to write char­ac­ters that talk a lot, women are won­der­ful at ex­press­ing them­selves. I think they have a great sense of hu­mour and they like to re­ally an­a­lyse.”</p>
    <p>And it is no ac­ci­dent that the char­ac­ters he dreams up are of­ten driven and am­bi­tious. “I like writ­ing em­pow­ered, strong women. I just re­ally en­joy those char­ac­ters – I like watch­ing them and I like to write them my­self.”</p>
    <p>3 PLENTY OF SHOW-STOP­PING THREADS</p>
    <p>The show will be as fash­ion­con­scious as Sex And The City (right). Many Sex And The City and Younger fans tuned in as much for the stylish out­fits as the sto­ry­lines.</p>
    <p>Emily In Paris will be no dif­fer­ent and over­see­ing it all is ac­claimed Amer­i­can cos­tume and fash­ion de­signer Pa­tri­cia Field, who was also be­hind Sex And The City and the film The Devil Wears Prada (2006).</p>
    <p>And Collins, who gets to wear some show-stop­ping threads as Lily, de­scribes the char­ac­ter’s style as “bright, bold and eclec­tic”.</p>
    <p>4 SATIRE ABOUT THE FASH­ION IN­DUS­TRY</p>
    <p>It is a bit of a cri­tique of the fash­ion in­dus­try: The French mar­ket­ing firm that Emily works at rep­re­sents var­i­ous names in the French fash­ion in­dus­try, so much of the show takes place in and satirises that set­ting.</p>
    <p>Star was in­spired, he says, by the old-school cou­ture houses as well as newer la­bels such as Supreme, an Amer­i­can skate­board­ing and hiphop-in­spired brand.</p>
    <p>The show also in­ter­ro­gates the mean­ing of fash­ion to­day, which he notes is evolv­ing be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I think the in­dus­try is chang­ing a lot, but even when we wrote and filmed this last year, there was still that ques­tion of, ‘What is fash­ion?’.</p>
    <p>“And it was some­thing I wanted to ex­plore in the se­ries be­cause France is the home of fash­ion,” he says.</p>
