    <p>BARCELONA • Barcelona coach Quique Se­tien does not feel un­der­mined by Lionel Messi’s damn­ing re­view of their un­der­whelm­ing sea­son and has in­sisted they can still win the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>After meekly sur­ren­der­ing the La Liga ti­tle to Real Madrid on Thurs­day, the Barca cap­tain did not hold back in his crit­i­cism of the team’s “weak” men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Messi also hinted at “a lot of change” should the Cata­lan giants lose to Napoli in the Cham­pi­ons League next month – the last-16 tie is finely balanced at 1-1 ahead of the home sec­ond leg – com­ments some have taken as a shot at Se­tien.</p>
    <p>Barca are in dan­ger of fin­ish­ing the sea­son empty-handed for the first time since the 2007-08 sea­son, but the for­mer Betis boss has claimed that he has no prob­lem with the Ar­gen­tinian’s as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>“Not at all. In cer­tain mo­ments, we all say things that can be taken badly,” said Se­tien. “I don’t give it much im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>“The feel­ing I get is we are ab­so­lutely aware that we have a very im­por­tant com­pe­ti­tion to come and we want to reach the fi­nal and win it.”</p>
    <p>It has been five years since Barca won the Cham­pi­ons League and since then, they have made the last four only once, when they ca­pit­u­lated to even­tual win­ners Liver­pool last sea­son.</p>
    <p>The route to next month’s Lis­bon fi­nal will not be any eas­ier, with Ger­man cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich, who hold a 3-0 first-leg lead in their last-16 tie with Chelsea, most likely wait­ing in the quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>But Se­tien, who was ap­pointed in Jan­uary, be­lieves that Barca, who held a dress­ing-room in­qui­si­tion on Fri­day, can still sal­vage their sea­son, even as talk of his sack­ing reaches fever pitch.</p>
    <p>“We have to im­prove in some ar­eas but you can’t con­vince me ev­ery­thing has been a disas­ter. It hasn’t,” he said. “We have to be more con­sis­tent, more re­li­able.</p>
    <p>“If we man­age to have a game like the one we played against Vil­lar­real (win­ning 4-1 in La Liga), where ev­ery­thing went well, it will un­doubt­edly give us a chance to win the Cham­pi­ons League.”</p>
    <p>Asked about spec­u­la­tion that the axe is set to fall on him, he added: “I al­ways knew things were not go­ing to be easy. At no time have I had the feel­ing of re­ally want­ing to leave.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one’s con­cern is to im­prove the team. We are try­ing to find so­lu­tions so things change and that is what the meet­ing was all about, pre­par­ing for the fu­ture with op­ti­mism.”</p>
