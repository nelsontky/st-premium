    <p>SHAH ALAM • Her eyes fixed on the flag in the dis­tance, Jamiatul Ak­mal Ab­dul Jabar takes a run-up past her cheer­ing friends and kicks a foot­ball down a golf course in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>This is “foot­golf”, a novel fu­sion of two of the world’s most pop­u­lar sports that is grow­ing fast and at­tract­ing peo­ple to the fair­ways.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows the rules of golf, but play­ers leave their clubs at home and in­stead tee off with their feet, try­ing to com­plete each hole in as few kicks as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Jamiatul was hav­ing a go at the sport with her friends on a con­verted course with 21-inch (53cm) holes out­side the Malaysian cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old said that she had con­sid­ered golf “such a bor­ing game” but was rather taken by foot­golf.</p>
    <p>“You feel that this is some­thing new, some­thing to ex­pe­ri­ence,” Jamiatul, an avid fut­sal player, said.</p>
    <p>“I’m plan­ning to book another (ses­sion).”</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of play­ers are now kick­ing balls on foot­golf cour­ses in over 35 coun­tries, and the sport has been gov­erned by an in­ter­na­tional fed­er­a­tion since 2012.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral World Cups have been staged, although this year’s edi­tion, orig­i­nally due to take place in Ja­pan, has been post­poned to next year due to the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>The sport’s ori­gins are not clear, but one of the ear­li­est recorded tour­na­ments was in the Nether­lands in 2008.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia, peo­ple started play­ing foot­golf in 2018 at the Bukit Je­lu­tong course out­side Kuala Lumpur, which had been aban­doned but was given a makeover by Foot­golf Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Jef­frey Cot­tam, who co-founded the or­gan­i­sa­tion, said ini­tial at­tempts to start the sport were re­sisted by course own­ers who baulked at the idea of let­ting foot­ballers onto their greens.</p>
    <p>But he fi­nally man­aged to set up at Bukit Je­lu­tong, and the com­pany now man­ages two foot­golf cour­ses in Malaysia – the sec­ond in the south­ern city of Jo­hor Baru – with a third on the way.</p>
    <p>More than 2,000 peo­ple play each month in Malaysia, Cot­tam said.</p>
    <p>“Foot­golf, like golf, isn’t about strength and how young you are,” he said. “It’s more tech­ni­cal... It’s not about beat­ing peo­ple. It’s about beat­ing the course.”</p>
    <p>He also hoped the grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of the sport could give some help to ail­ing cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Golf has fallen out of favour in many coun­tries, with young peo­ple largely un­in­ter­ested and few hav­ing the time to spend a whole day play­ing the sport, lead­ing to many cour­ses clos­ing.</p>
    <p>But foot­golf is giv­ing them some much-needed rev­enue. In the United States, for in­stance, the sport is now played on more than 500 cour­ses, ac­cord­ing to the Amer­i­can Foot­golf Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Danny Chia, a Malaysian pro­fes­sional golfer who plays on the Asian Tour, also said foot­golf might help cour­ses.</p>
    <p>“There are still a lot of golf cour­ses out there that are not do­ing very well,” he said. “This could be a new av­enue for them.”</p>
