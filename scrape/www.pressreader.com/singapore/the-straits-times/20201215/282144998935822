    <p>In­stant f und trans­fer ser­vices PayNow and Fast will open up to non-bank fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions from Fe­bru­ary next year, mark­ing an era of in­tense com­pe­ti­tion in the e-wal­let space.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only ac­count hold­ers with 23 banks can in­stantly move funds across banks through PayNow or Fast, or both. But go­ing for­ward, such fund trans­fers may also be pos­si­ble from e-wal­lets like GrabPay and Sing­tel Dash.</p>
    <p>The open­ing up of PayNow and Fast comes amid the award­ing of dig­i­tal full bank li­cences to two tech firms – the Grab-Sing­tel con­sor­tium and tech gi­ant Sea – early this month.</p>
    <p>The li­cence es­sen­tially al­lows them to pro­vide on­line re­tail bank ser­vices such as sav­ings ac­count open­ing as well as debit and credit card is­su­ing from as early as 2022.</p>
    <p>Tech ed­i­tor Irene Tham ex­plains the sig­nif­i­cance of the new de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Q What is PayNow and Fast?</p>
    <p>A Fast is an elec­tronic funds trans­fer ser­vice, first launched in 2014, that en­ables par­tic­i­pat­ing bank ac­count hold­ers to trans­fer Singapore dol­lar funds to one an­other across banks in­stantly.</p>
    <p>PayNow runs on top of the Fast pay­ment sys­tem and maps users’ bank ac­counts to their NRIC or mo­bile phone num­bers, or Unique En­tity Num­ber (UEN) for busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>This al­lows in­stant fund trans­fers to be made to NRIC or mo­bile phone num­bers, or UENs – which are more read­ily avail­able than bank ac­count num­bers.</p>
    <p>Q What is the big­gest ben­e­fit to con­sumers from the open­ing up of PayNow and Fast?</p>
    <p>A Be­ing able to re­trieve stray cred­its from e-wal­lets like GrabPay and Dash will be a big plus.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, con­sumers top up th­ese stored-value fa­cil­i­ties and end up with a few cents or dol­lars of left­over cred­its, and have no choice but to con­tinue top­ping up and spend­ing from the ac­counts.</p>
    <p>If GrabPay and Dash join the PayNow or Fast pay­ment net­work, con­sumers will have the choice of trans­fer­ring any left­over cred­its to their pre­ferred bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing users to freely move cred­its in e-wal­lets could pre­vent fi­nan­cial losses, which oBike users suf­fered when the bi­cy­cle-shar­ing com­pany pulled out of Singapore in 2018. Hun­dreds of thou­sands of oBike users were owed their de­posits of up to $49.</p>
    <p>Also, GrabPay and Dash e-wal­let users need not open a sav­ings ac­count with the Grab-Sing­tel dig­i­tal bank in fu­ture to with­draw any locked cred­its.</p>
    <p>Q How will th­ese de­vel­op­ments solve</p>
    <p>the cur­rent con­fu­sion over QR code scan­ning at pay­ment coun­ters?</p>
    <p>A The open­ing up of PayNow will pro­vide true in­ter­op­er­abil­ity, which has not been achieved even by the Singapore Quick Re­sponse Code (SGQR).</p>
    <p>The roll-out of SGQR in 2018 freed mer­chants from the chore of dis­play­ing mul­ti­ple QR codes, such as DBS PayLah!, OCBC Pay Any­one, UOB Mighty, GrabPay, Sing­tel Dash, Ali­pay and UnionPay.</p>
    <p>But SGQR only neat­ens the pay­ment counter by re­duc­ing phys­i­cal clut­ter. Con­sumers still need to search for the logo of their pre­ferred e-wal­let un­der SGQR to check if they can pay us­ing that wal­let. An SGQR with one logo, say GrabPay, means only GrabPay will be ac­cepted.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, SGQR does not solve the prob­lem of mer­chants hav­ing to ne­go­ti­ate sep­a­rate pay­ment set­tle­ment re­la­tion­ships with in­di­vid­ual e-wal­let op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if a mer­chant part­ners Sing­tel Dash, it is paid by Sing­tel. Sim­i­larly, mer­chants part­ner­ing GrabPay are paid by Grab at the end of a busi­ness day – un­der their re­spec­tive closed-loop ecosys­tems.</p>
    <p>For a mer­chant to ac­cept all the e-wal­lets in use, it must also set up pay­ment ac­counts with all the re­spec­tive pay­ment providers – Sing­tel, Grab and the banks.</p>
    <p>En­ter PayNow.</p>
    <p>When all the e-wal­let play­ers here are linked to PayNow, mer­chants just need to ne­go­ti­ate pay­ment set­tle­ment with any e-wal­let op­er­a­tor to ac­cept pay­ment from any e-wal­let.</p>
    <p>This means that the mer­chant that pre­vi­ously part­nered Sing­tel Dash can also ac­cept pay­ments from any bank­ing apps – DBS PayLah! or OCBC Pay Any­one – with­out hav­ing to form a new pay­ment set­tle­ment re­la­tion­ship with any of the banks.</p>
    <p>E-wal­let play­ers will want to join the PayNow net­work as top-ups via PayNow are cheaper than those done over Visa or Master­card’s pay­ment net­work.</p>
    <p>The cost of top-ups has so far been borne by e-wal­let op­er­a­tors to en­cour­age user adop­tion.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing for­ward, get­ting con­sumers to in­crease the float amount in e-wal­lets will be­come highly com­pet­i­tive, and they can ex­pect more pro­mo­tions.</p>
    <p>Q Will I be able to top up my Nets FlashPay and ez-link trans­port cards from any e-wal­let?</p>
    <p>A Nets and EZ-Link are li­censed as ma­jor pay­ment in­sti­tu­tions un­der Singapore’s Pay­ment Ser­vices Act, and are el­i­gi­ble to con­nect to Fast and PayNow.</p>
    <p>If Nets and EZ-Link j oin the PayNow or Fast pay­ment net­work, con­sumers can top up their Nets and EZ-Link on­line ac­counts from any PayNow-linked e-wal­let or bank­ing app.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the PayNow net­work is ul­ti­mately a busi­ness de­ci­sion, and will in­cur a one-time and re­cur­ring trans­ac­tion costs.</p>
    <p>Right now, peo­ple top up their ez-link or FlashPay trans­port cards at the self-ser­vice ma­chines in­stalled at train sta­tions, 7-Eleven and Cheers con­ve­nience stores, and the ATMs of ma­jor banks.</p>
    <p>The ez-link and Nets FlashPay cards can also be au­to­mat­i­cally topped up by link­ing them to credit or debit cards.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, users can down­load the EZ-Link and the Nets FlashPay Reader apps to top up their plas­tic trans­port cards, by plac­ing them next to their nearfield com­mu­ni­ca­tion-en­abled An­droid phones.</p>
    <p>App users need to sup­ply credit card de­tails.</p>
    <p>Ez-link cards can also be topped up via Giro, but DBS Bank and POSB re­main the only par­tic­i­pat­ing banks in the Giro scheme.</p>
    <p>Q Will my e-wal­let cred­its be se­cure?</p>
    <p>A Yes. Only en­ti­ties li­censed as ma­jor pay­ment in­sti­tu­tions un­der Singapore’s Pay­ment Ser­vices Act can con­nect to Fast and PayNow.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor pay­ment in­sti­tu­tions need to meet the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore’s tech­nol­ogy risk man­age­ment and anti-money laun­der­ing re­quire­ments, among other obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>E-wal­let op­er­a­tors need to part­ner any of the 23 Fast banks to ben­e­fit from Fast or PayNow.</p>
    <p>The bank part­ners will han­dle the e-wal­let op­er­a­tors’ pay­ment set­tle­ment and trans­ac­tion obli­ga­tions to other Fast and PayNow par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The 23 Fast banks in­clude DBS, OCBC Bank, United Over­seas Bank, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, May­bank, HSBC, CIMB Bank, Citibank, BNP Paribas and Mizuho Bank.</p>
