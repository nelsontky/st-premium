    <p>Eight years ago, Amer­i­can au­thor Diane Cook be­gan imag­in­ing a swathe of wilder­ness.</p>
    <p>She did not know how or why it would ex­ist, only that it would be wider than any wilder­ness that ex­ists now and also the last of its kind.</p>
    <p>Then she de­cided she would put some peo­ple in it.</p>
    <p>This thought ex­per­i­ment co­a­lesced into The New Wilder­ness, Cook’s first novel, set in a dystopian fu­ture where ur­ban pol­lu­tion is so se­vere that chil­dren are dy­ing from it.</p>
    <p>A group of peo­ple vol­un­teer for an ex­per­i­ment in which they live as no­mads in a wilder­ness zone, sur­viv­ing spar­ingly off the land and leav­ing as lit­tle waste as they can.</p>
    <p>Cook, 44, has long plumbed the re­la­tion­ship be­tween hu­mans and the nat­u­ral world in her work – her 2014 short story col­lec­tion was ti­tled Man V. Na­ture – but she says she her­self is no ex­pert at sur­viv­ing in the wild.</p>
    <p>“I like get­ting away from the city,” she says over Skype from Michi­gan in the United States, where she is wait­ing out the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I like be­ing in the woods. But the idea of sur­viv­ing in the woods is not some­thing I want to do.”</p>
    <p>Most of her re­search, she says, came off the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple on­line trade in­for­ma­tion on how to sur­vive, whether it’s a Na­tive Amer­i­can tribe who are pass­ing down in­for­ma­tion via the In­ter­net be­cause that’s the best way to do it, or ex­treme sur­vival­ist prep­pers who live in the woods and know how to sur­vive be­cause they have de­cided there’s a com­ing apoca­lypse.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of cour­ses that you can take about how to skin an an­i­mal and make a hide.”</p>
    <p>In the novel, the cli­mate cri­sis has al­ready come and gone and peo­ple are re­signed to its af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>Cook, who is now work­ing on a screen­play based on the world of her novel, says mat­ter-of-factly that this is part and par­cel of in­vent­ing a fu­ture world.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t imag­ine a dif­fer­ent des­ti­na­tion. It just seemed like this has to be what’s go­ing to hap­pen if we don’t change any­thing.”</p>
    <p>If her char­ac­ters dis­play, at times, a de­gree of cal­lous­ness that may shock those back in civil­i­sa­tion – when they lose both one of their num­ber and their best knife in an ac­ci­dent, they mourn the knife more – Cook says it is hardly a leap.</p>
    <p>“They’ve sur­vived so long, they’ve seen so many peo­ple die around them that it’s be­come com­mon­place.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly, I see it hap­pen­ing now i n the pan­demic, where we’re mak­ing ex­cep­tions and ac­cept­ing cer­tain peo­ple’s fates. I think we think peo­ple are ex­pend­able but we don’t ad­mit it.”</p>
    <p>At the heart of the novel is the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the nar­ra­tors, Bea and her young daugh­ter Agnes, who was dy­ing in the city but now thrives in the wilder­ness.</p>
    <p>“I started this book as a daugh­ter,” says Cook. Her mother died of can­cer in 2008.</p>
    <p>“As a writer, I’m al­ways try­ing to fig­ure out some kind of way to hold on to her.”</p>
    <p>Half­way through writ­ing the book, she gave birth to her daugh­ter, who is nearly three years old. Her son was born in June this year.</p>
    <p>“I have this grief as a daugh­ter, and then I have this other grief as a mother, be­cause I know my daugh­ter will even­tu­ally be­come some­one who’s un­know­able to me, be­cause she’s go­ing to be­come her own per­son.</p>
    <p>“This sense of loss pass­ing from gen­er­a­tion to gen­er­a­tion was some­thing I drew on.”</p>
