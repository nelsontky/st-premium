    <p>WASH­ING­TON • FireEye, one of the largest US cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pa­nies, said yes­ter­day that it had been hacked, pos­si­bly by a for­eign ad­ver­sary.</p>
    <p>The at­tack­ers made off with sen­si­tive tools that FireEye uses to find vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in clients’ com­puter net­works.</p>
    <p>The at­tack­ers were a “na­tion with top-tier of­fen­sive ca­pa­bil­i­ties”, said chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Kevin Man­dia.</p>
    <p>He did not iden­tify the coun­try sus­pected in the at­tack, but a per­son fa­mil­iar with the in­ci­dent said in­ves­ti­ga­tors be­lieve hack­ers closely aligned with the Rus­sian gov­ern­ment were be­hind it.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers “tai­lored their world-class ca­pa­bil­i­ties specif­i­cally to tar­get and at­tack FireEye”, said Mr Man­dia in a com­pany blog on Tues­day. “They are highly trained in op­er­a­tional se­cu­rity and ex­e­cuted with dis­ci­pline and fo­cus.”</p>
    <p>The mo­tive for the at­tack was not clear, but the com­pany said “red team tools” were stolen.</p>
    <p>Red team tools mimic the be­hav­iour of hack­ers and en­able FireEye to pro­vide “di­ag­nos­tic se­cu­rity ser­vices” to cus­tomers. So far, the com­pany had not seen ev­i­dence that any­one had used the tools in an at­tack.</p>
    <p>There is no ev­i­dence that FireEye’s hack­ing tools have been used or that client data was stolen. But the Fed­eral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) and Mi­crosoft said they are in­ves­ti­gat­ing.</p>
    <p>The FBI’s cy­ber di­vi­sion as­sis­tant di­rec­tor Matt Gorham said that pre­lim­i­nary in­di­ca­tions “show an ac­tor with a high level of so­phis­ti­ca­tion con­sis­tent with a na­tion state”.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the tool theft, the hack­ers also ap­peared to be in­ter­ested in a sub­set of FireEye cus­tomers: gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>A former De­fence Depart­ment of­fi­cial fa­mil­iar with the case said that Rus­sia was high on the early list of sus­pects. In the run-up to the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, US of­fi­cials ex­posed some Rus­sian hack­ing tech­niques.</p>
    <p>The at­tack on FireEye could also be a re­tal­i­a­tion of sorts as the com­pany’s in­ves­ti­ga­tors have of­ten called out units of the Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence – the GRU, the SVR and the FSB, the suc­ces­sor agency to the Soviet-era KGB – for high-pro­file hack­ing at­tacks on the power grid in Ukraine and on Amer­i­can mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>They were also the first to call out the Rus­sian hack­ers be­hind an at­tack that suc­cess­fully dis­man­tled the in­dus­trial safety locks at a Saudi petro­chem­i­cal plant, the very last step be­fore trig­ger­ing an ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>“The Rus­sians be­lieve i n re­venge,” said cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­pert James A. Lewis at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Wash­ing­ton. “Sud­denly, FireEye’s cus­tomers are vul­ner­a­ble.”</p>
    <p>Other se­cu­rity com­pa­nies have been suc­cess­fully hacked be­fore, in­clud­ing Bit9, Kasper­sky Lab and RSA, un­der­scor­ing the dif­fi­culty in keep­ing any­thing dig­i­tal away from the most so­phis­ti­cated hack­ers.</p>
    <p>Based in Cal­i­for­nia, FireEye pro­tects more than 1,000 gov­ern­ment and law en­force­ment agen­cies, ac­cord­ing to its web­site.</p>
    <p>“Plenty of sim­i­lar com­pa­nies have also been popped like this,” said a Western se­cu­rity of­fi­cial who asked not to be named.</p>
    <p>Mr Dmitri Alper­ovitch, co­founder and former chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer at top ri­val Crowd­Strike, said: “The goal of these op­er­a­tions is typ­i­cally to col­lect valu­able in­tel­li­gence that can help them de­feat se­cu­rity coun­ter­mea­sures and en­able hack­ing of or­gan­i­sa­tions all over the world.”</p>
    <p>The hack­ing was dis­cov­ered in re­cent weeks af­ter a sus­pi­cious log-in was found to have sur­passed the two-fac­tor au­then­ti­ca­tion re­quire­ment on the com­pany’s vir­tual pri­vate net­work, ac­cord­ing to FireEye.</p>
    <p>The at­tack­ers car­ried out the hack­ing from two dozen IP ad­dresses based in the United States, none of which has been de­tected as part of a cy­ber at­tack be­fore – the type of so­phis­ti­cated tac­tics that led FireEye to be­lieve a for­eign in­tel­li­gence ser­vice was be­hind the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>FireEye said it has been work­ing to shore up de­fences against its own tools with dif­fer­ent soft­ware mak­ers, and it re­leased coun­ter­mea­sures pub­licly.</p>
    <p>Mr Man­dia wrote that none of the red team tools ex­ploited so­called “zero-day vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties”, mean­ing the rel­e­vant flaws should al­ready be pub­lic.</p>
