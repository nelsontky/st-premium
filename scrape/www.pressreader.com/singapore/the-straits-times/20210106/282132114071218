    <p>Cle­menti For­est will con­tinue to be ear­marked for res­i­den­tial use, but there is “no im­me­di­ate need” to de­velop the site for hous­ing, said Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten re­sponse to Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC), Mr Lee noted that the site has been zoned for res­i­den­tial use since 1998.</p>
    <p>“We will... re­tain the zon­ing of the site, while giv­ing our fu­ture gen­er­a­tions the op­tion of de­cid­ing whether to use it for hous­ing, if the need arises,” he said.</p>
    <p>Drone footage of the green stretch near King Al­bert Park went vi­ral last Oc­to­ber, with na­ture en­thu­si­asts later start­ing a pe­ti­tion to call for the area to be re­zoned as a na­ture park.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan had asked if any en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact stud­ies had been done on the area, and if the land could be des­ig­nated as a na­tional park or na­ture re­serve.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Den­nis Tan (Hougang) had also asked on Mon­day if the Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment would con­sider re­view­ing the sta­tus of Cle­menti For­est and other forests ear­marked for devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In his re­sponse to both MPs, the min­is­ter stressed that land-scarce, densely pop­u­lated Sin­ga­pore will have to bal­ance the needs of devel­op­ment and con­ser­va­tion. As part of long-term plan­ning, land is set aside early for its po­ten­tial use for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “In do­ing so, we en­deav­our to bal­ance the de­mands and trade-offs across a va­ri­ety of land-use needs, in­clud­ing that of hous­ing, green spa­ces, in­fra­struc­ture and work­places.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that Sin­ga­pore has, where pos­si­ble, re­viewed its plans to re­tain green spa­ces that could have been used for in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Mandai man­groves and mud­flats were ini­tially planned for fac­tory use. But the area’s eco­log­i­cal value led the au­thor­i­ties to pre­serve it as a na­ture park, Mr Lee said.</p>
    <p>Other green spa­ces, such as Thom­son and Wind­sor na­ture parks, could have been used for hous­ing but are cur­rently re­tained as green buf­fers to Sin­ga­pore’s na­ture re­serves, he added.</p>
    <p>And yet other ar­eas such as the Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve and the up­com­ing Khatib Bongsu Na­ture Park were once prawn farm­ing ar­eas. These were aban­doned, ac­quired by the Gov­ern­ment, and have over time be­come green spa­ces in­hab­ited by indige­nous flora and fauna.</p>
    <p>Cle­menti For­est was it­self an aban­doned rub­ber plan­ta­tion that has be­come a sec­ondary for­est, Mr Lee added.</p>
    <p>At present, about 7,800ha of land in Sin­ga­pore is set aside for green spa­ces, rang­ing from na­ture re­serves to parks and park con­nec­tors. An ad­di­tional 1,000ha of green space will be added over the next 10 to 15 years.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter weigh­ing the al­ter­na­tives and trade-offs, there will be ar­eas that we can­not avoid de­vel­op­ing,” Mr Lee said. “None­the­less, for these sites, pos­si­ble en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pacts will still be care­fully man­aged, and nat­u­ral ele­ments will be in­te­grated within devel­op­ments where pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>He added that there may be changes to how Sin­ga­pore plans for of­fice and in­dus­trial spa­ces as its econ­omy trans­forms, with road space po­ten­tially freed up for other pur­poses as the coun­try moves to­wards its vi­sion of be­ing car-lite.</p>
