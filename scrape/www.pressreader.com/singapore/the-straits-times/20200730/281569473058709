    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments surged be­tween April and June, as the pan­demic took a toll on the labour mar­ket. The over­all un­em­ploy­ment rate rose to 2.9 per cent last month af­ter tak­ing into ac­count sea­sonal variations – the high­est in just over a decade, and up from 2.4 per cent in March.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments surged be­tween April and June, as the Covid-19 pan­demic took a toll on the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The over­all un­em­ploy­ment rate rose to 2.9 per cent last month af­ter tak­ing into ac­count sea­sonal variations – the high­est in just over a</p>
    <p>decade, and up from 2.4 per cent in March. The rate for Sin­ga­pore­ans rose to 4 per cent, from 3.5 per cent, and the rate for Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents com­bined rose to 3.9 per cent, from 3.3 per cent, pre­lim­i­nary data re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>Still, un­em­ploy­ment re­mained lower than pre­vi­ous peaks dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis and the Sars out­break, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­em­ployed Sin­ga­pore­ans climbed nearly 20 per cent to 79,600 last month, up from 66,900 in March. To­gether with per­ma­nent res­i­dents, there were 90,500 un­em­ployed res­i­dents last month, up from 76,200 in March.</p>
    <p>Total em­ploy­ment, in­clud­ing those on work passes but ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers, plunged by 121,800 in the se­cond quar­ter – the big­gest quar­terly fall on record. This is more than four times the fall in the first quar­ter, and means that the econ­omy has shed a net 147,500 work­ers in the first half of the year.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments more than dou­bled in the se­cond quar­ter, with 6,700 work­ers laid off, up from 3,220 in the first quar­ter. This was higher than the peak of 5,510 dur­ing the 2003 Sars out­break, but be­low the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis high of 12,760, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Lay­offs rose sig­nif­i­cantly in the last quar­ter in whole­sale trade and trans­port equip­ment due to lower de­mand for re­tail and air travel.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day that the con­trac­tion in em­ploy­ment was “quite re­flec­tive of the work­force com­po­si­tion” in terms of the spread be­tween lo­cal and for­eign work­ers, but added that the ex­act breakdown is not yet avail­able.</p>
    <p>She also noted that the jobs sit­u­a­tion may not have bot­tomed out.</p>
    <p>“The out­look is still un­cer­tain,” she said. “Sin­ga­pore is very plugged into the global econ­omy. When there’s weak­ness in global de­mand, com­pa­nies are likely to be much more cau­tious.”</p>
    <p>In ser­vices, the se­cond-quar­ter con­trac­tion in em­ploy­ment was sharpest in food and bev­er­age; re­tail trade; arts, en­ter­tain­ment and recre­ation; and ed­u­ca­tion. Con­struc­tion also saw a steep drop in em­ploy­ment, while man­u­fac­tur­ing saw a more mod­est de­cline.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo noted that the con­struc­tion, marine and process in­dus­tries will need more ad­just­ment as they deal with strict re­quire­ments for re­sum­ing ac­tiv­ity on work­sites, and said there will be sup­port, as the Gov­ern­ment looks into for­eign worker levies.</p>
    <p>“We know very well that they’ve car­ried the heav­ier bur­den on be­half of all of us, and we are very mind­ful that we will try our best to sup­port them through­out this pe­riod of tran­si­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said he was con­cerned that the fig­ures may not re­flect the full pic­ture, as older work­ers who are not re-em­ployed, or for­eign­ers whose work passes are not re­newed, are not in­cluded in the over­all re­trench­ment num­bers.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers ex­pect un­em­ploy­ment to rise in the com­ing months, as mea­sures like the Jobs Sup­port Scheme ta­per off.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat also an­nounced that trainee­ships will be ex­panded to cater to mid-ca­reer job seek­ers. They can ap­ply for over 13,000 at­tach­ments from Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng urged em­ploy­ers to take on work­ers who may not be the per­fect fit but are will­ing to learn, say­ing: “When the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion passes... they will be able to emerge stronger.”</p>
    <p>The worst may be yet to come on the em­ploy­ment front, ex­perts said, fol­low­ing the re­lease of pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures yes­ter­day that showed re­trench­ments more than dou­bled in the se­cond quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>They agreed that the job mar­ket has not bot­tomed out amid the un­cer­tainty of the coron­avirus pan­demic, but that gov­ern­ment mea­sures have gone some way in mit­i­gat­ing the im­pact.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said in a Face­book post that he ex­pects re­trench­ment and un­em­ploy­ment fig­ures to con­tinue climb­ing in the se­cond half of the year, with an un­cer­tain out­look across many in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>He noted that be­sides small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, large lo­cal en­ter­prises and multi­na­tional com­pa­nies are also im­pacted with de­layed or re­duced in­vest­ments, cur­tailed pro­duc­tion and freezes in global head­count.</p>
    <p>“I am par­tic­u­larly con­cerned that the fig­ures may not re­flect the full im­pact of the (job losses) as I do see and hear of work­ers be­ing con­trac­tu­ally ter­mi­nated (though with ad­e­quate no­tice pay), older work­ers not be­ing re-em­ployed, as well as for­eign work­ers on work per­mit, S Pass and Em­ploy­ment Pass whose passes are not re­newed. These do not count to­wards over­all re­trench­ment num­bers,” he said.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling said the total and res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rates are also likely to rise fur­ther in the se­cond half of the year. “With­out the SG United Jobs and Skills pro­gramme, the lo­cal job mar­ket con­di­tions would have likely de­te­ri­o­rated faster,” she said. “How­ever, the pri­vate con­sump­tion story is likely to re­main muted, and busi­ness hir­ing plans are also tepid in tan­dem.”</p>
    <p>United Overseas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said head­winds in the tourism-re­lated sec­tor, the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment and resur­gence in Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Sin­ga­pore’s key trad­ing part­ners are among the fac­tors that may im­pede eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>“Given the slow­down, com­pa­nies may con­tinue to show re­luc­tance in hir­ing while the pres­sure to re­trench their ex­ist­ing work­force could also in­crease.”</p>
    <p>DBS Bank se­nior econ­o­mist Irvin Seah said the labour mar­ket will con­tinue to de­te­ri­o­rate, even though eco­nomic growth is likely to have hit the bot­tom in the se­cond quar­ter. He ex­pects the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate to peak at 4.2 per cent by the year end.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness sen­ti­ment seems to have perked up af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, as about 17 per cent of com­pa­nies polled by the Min­istry of Man­power last month in­di­cated in­tent to cut their head­count in the next two months, com­pared with 19 per cent in April and 21 per cent in May.</p>
    <p>But May­bank Kim Eng economists Chua Hak Bin and Lee Ju Ye also noted that em­ploy­ment data is a lag­ging in­di­ca­tor, which means that the neg­a­tive im­pact from the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures can show up in job losses in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“Lo­cals could ac­count for a larger pro­por­tion of the lay­offs in the se­cond half (of the year), as the job sup­port schemes and wage sub­si­dies ex­pire in Au­gust,” they added.</p>
    <p>On re­trench­ments, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told re­porters yes­ter­day: “We un­der­stand that com­pa­nies are some­times hav­ing to man­age on many fronts and there will be oc­ca­sions when they have not com­mu­ni­cated as clearly to their em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“There will be oc­ca­sions when it has caught the em­ploy­ees by sur­prise... and so our en­cour­age­ment to com­pa­nies is to make sure that you alert your em­ploy­ees early.”</p>
    <p>She added that firms that are in ne­go­ti­a­tions with the unions should not re­trench staff be­fore the talks are com­plete.</p>
    <p>“I think the way in which this dread­ful process is han­dled is crit­i­cal. There has to be an un­der­stand­ing of the pres­sure that work­ers face, there has to be an un­der­stand­ing that we need to ac­cord them dig­nity and re­spect.”</p>
