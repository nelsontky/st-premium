    <p>So Lionel Messi prob­a­bly will not be check­ing the tele­vi­sion guide to see which chan­nel shows Sh­effield United ver­sus Wolves to­mor­row. His Manch­ester City bow could have come at Mo­lineux next week, but his di­vorce from Barcelona will take an­other year to ar­range. In­stead, the City debu­tants might be the less fa­mous Nathan Ake and Fer­ran Tor­res.</p>
    <p>It con­tin­ues a theme. The Premier League may be the world’s best league but the planet’s out­stand­ing player is rarely found there. Only two of the last 40 Bal­lon d’Or win­ners have come from English clubs and both Michael Owen and Cris­tiano Ron­aldo soon de­camped to Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>Since Ron­aldo and Fer­nando Tor­res placed first and third in the 2008 vot­ing, there have been 33 top-three fin­ish­ers. The Premier League has had a soli­tary rep­re­sen­ta­tive: Vir­gil van Dijk, sec­ond last year.</p>
    <p>In part, of course, that re­flects the du­op­oly of Messi and Ron­aldo, who have swal­lowed up 20 of those 33 podium places. But they in turn high­light the grav­i­ta­tional pull of Real and Barcelona. The world’s two big­gest clubs have a mag­netic ap­peal, and not just to South Amer­i­cans. Bal­lon d’Or short­lists have tended to be filled out by Messi and Ron­aldo’s side­kicks: some, like Luka Mo­dric, Luis Suarez and Gareth Bale, have ac­quired more votes af­ter leav­ing Eng­land.</p>
    <p>So the Premier League’s ap­peal is based on dif­fer­ent grounds. It has more strength in depth and, with five win­ners in eight sea­sons, more un­pre­dictabil­ity. There is more com­pe­ti­tion for the ti­tle of its best foot­baller. There is a temp­ta­tion to call Eng­land’s finest sec­ond-tier sign­ings, but that does not mean sec­ond best. Nev­er­the­less, play­ers such as David Silva and Ser­gio Aguero came to the Premier League in part be­cause Real and Barcelona did not buy them.</p>
    <p>Their tal­ents were no secrets, but the Premier League’s out­stand­ing im­ports tend to fall into two cat­e­gories: those al­ready es­tab­lished as the best of the rest and those who grad­u­ate to that rank. Kevin de Bruyne, bought as the Bun­desliga’s reign­ing player of the year, falls into the first cat­e­gory. Sa­dio Mane, Roberto Firmino and van Dijk may be­long in the sec­ond. If the Premier League does not make its own stars, it makes them shinier. Just look at Bruno Fer­nan­des, Mo­hamed Salah and Eden Hazard.</p>
    <p>This sum­mer’s two most aus­pi­cious ar­rivals look cases in point. Timo Werner and Kai Havertz follow in the foot­steps of de Bruyne and Chris­tian Pulisic, up-and-com­ing play­ers from the</p>
    <p>Bun­desliga signed for pre­mium prices. English clubs can use their fi­nan­cial mus­cle to bring in foot­ballers who might not merit the billing of Messi and Ron­aldo-style Galac­ti­cos but who could be­come among the world’s top 10 foot­ballers; de Bruyne un­doubt­edly has.</p>
    <p>In the past, they have still been over­shad­owed by Real and Barca but just as Messi and Ron­aldo’s decade of dom­i­nance is un­likely to be em­u­lated by two play­ers again, Spain’s su­per­pow­ers may be in de­cline. Both are shorter of money and Messi’s sup­port­ing cast is lesser. It all un­der­lines why the Premier League may be the planet’s out­stand­ing di­vi­sion, even if Messi re­mains its premier player.</p>
    <p>English clubs can use their fi­nan­cial mus­cle to bring in foot­ballers who might not merit the billing of Messi and Ron­aldo-style Galac­ti­cos but who could be­come among the world’s top 10 foot­ballers.</p>
