    <p>When Ms Sha­nia Aw started think­ing about us­ing birth con­trol, she first ap­proached her fam­ily’s gen­eral prac­ti­tioner (GP).</p>
    <p>The con­sul­ta­tion lasted three min­utes and, de­spite pay­ing for it, the 21-year-old left with­out any in­for­ma­tion or pre­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>“He told me that I should have come with my mother, even though I was over 18,” said the self-em­ployed woman, who is sin­gle.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing had pos­i­tive ex­pe­ri­ences with other GPs, the im­pres­sion of this one stayed with Ms Aw, who makes sculp­tures.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, she switched from get­ting con­tra­cep­tives from clin­ics to an on­line provider.</p>
    <p>More Sin­ga­pore­ans like Ms Aw may be turn­ing to telemedici­ne ser­vices for sen­si­tive health mat­ters, also due in part to the de­sire to stay safe amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said on Oct 5 that while the Min­istry of Health (MOH) does not track the num­ber of telemedici­ne users, it “has ob­served a re­cent in­crease in the num­ber of pub­lic and pri­vate healthcare providers of­fer­ing telemedici­ne ser­vices”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the founders of Ease Healthcare, a dig­i­tal start-up that Ms Aw ap­proached for birth con­trol help, cir­cuit breaker mea­sures from April to June in­creased de­mand for its ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Many pa­tients who were in need of ser­vices like birth con­trol pre­scrip­tions were un­able to ac­cess them dur­ing that pe­riod,” said co­founder Rio Hoe, 27. The start-up works with two GPs in pri­vate prac­tice, and pro­cures its birth con­trol pills from Unity phar­macy.</p>
    <p>Other telemedici­ne providers have also regis­tered this uptick.</p>
    <p>Speedoc, an on-de­mand healthcare ser­vice that also pro­vides other ser­vices such as doc­tor or nurse house calls, soft launched its telemedici­ne ser­vice in April, just in time for the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“We’ve seen a mul­ti­fold in­crease in pa­tient re­quests, es­pe­cially when the cir­cuit breaker came into ef­fect,” said Ms Serene Cai, 27, one of Speedoc’s co-founders.</p>
    <p>“Even though the cir­cuit breaker has ended, many pa­tients are still hes­i­tant to visit a clinic for fear of un­in­ten­tional con­tact with some­one who may have been in­fected.”</p>
    <p>Speedoc and Ease both use video calls with their doc­tors through their app and Web plat­form, re­spec­tively, for con­sul­ta­tions and pre­scrip­tions.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als are split on why peo­ple turn to the In­ter­net for in­for­ma­tion on sex­ual health rather than stick­ing to tra­di­tional, in-per­son in­ter­ac­tions with doc­tors. Dr Gor­don Lim, founder of Gor­don Lim Clinic and Surgery for Women, said shy­ness or the per­cep­tion that “doc­tors have no time to pay at­ten­tion to these is­sues” might be re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients may also be­come un­com­fort­able when they per­ceive some doc­tors to be prob­ing too much.</p>
    <p>But the ques­tions might be pro­fes­sion­ally jus­ti­fied – and an in-per­son con­sul­ta­tion nec­es­sary – as the doc­tor seeks to find what is best for ev­ery pa­tient, since those seek­ing birth con­trol pills may not be aware of side ef­fects or other op­tions avail­able, added Dr Lim.</p>
    <p>Con­sul­tant ob­ste­tri­cian and gy­nae­col­o­gist Tan Thiam Chye of Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal told The Straits Times that there is a large amount of false in­for­ma­tion on the In­ter­net, and cited a re­cent sur­vey that showed Sin­ga­pore­ans had poor “sex­ual health and con­tra­cep­tion knowl­edge”.</p>
    <p>“We need more aware­ness cam­paigns and fo­rums to ed­u­cate cou­ples, es­pe­cially on long-term con­tra­cep­tion meth­ods health,” he added.</p>
    <p>While a com­bi­na­tion of shy­ness, dis­com­fort and con­ve­nience may ac­count for the shift to­wards telemedici­ne, such ser­vices cur­rently oc­cupy a reg­u­la­tory grey area. Telemedici­ne providers will not be of­fi­cially li­censed un­der the up­com­ing Healthcare Ser­vices Act un­til at least late next year. But in the in­terim, MOH has set up a “sand­box” for them so that these ser­vices can de­velop here while be­ing closely mon­i­tored on pa­ram­e­ters such as clin­i­cal pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>MOH has also said providers must com­ply with the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil’s Eth­i­cal Code and Eth­i­cal Guide­lines, and take ref­er­ence from all other ap­pli­ca­ble guide­lines.</p>
    <p>While the telemedici­ne in­dus­try here is still in its in­fancy, many said they are happy that al­ter­na­tive op­tions to a tra­di­tional visit to the doc­tor are now avail­able. Cre­ative di­rec­tor Jessie Chew, 29, said: “I’m glad that there are now more com­fort­able op­tions avail­able that help you avoid some of the stigma (at­tached to such mat­ters).” and sex­ual</p>
