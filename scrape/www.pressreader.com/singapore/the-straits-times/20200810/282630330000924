    <p>Movie fans l ook­ing for­ward to watch­ing Mu­lan on the big screen were deeply dis­ap­pointed af­ter entertainm­ent gi­ant Dis­ney an­nounced last Tuesday the block­buster movie would not be shown in cin­e­mas in most coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It said Mu­lan would in­stead pre­miere on stream­ing plat­form Dis­ney+ next month af­ter its cin­e­matic re­lease had been de­layed sev­eral times since March be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mu­lan, a US$200 mil­lion (S$274.5 mil­lion) live-ac­tion re­make of the 1998 an­i­mated hit of the same name, stars Liu Yifei, Don­nie Yen, Jet Li and Gong Li.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an in­de­pen­dent cin­ema owner in France took his dis­ap­point­ment and frus­tra­tion a step fur­ther over Dis­ney’s move.</p>
    <p>In a video posted on Twit­ter and which went vi­ral later, Mr Ger­ard Le­moine was seen smash­ing the pop-up pro­mo­tional poster of Mu­lan with a base­ball bat.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Hollywood trade pub­li­ca­tion Dead­line, he said he had been pro­mot­ing Mu­lan for months and was hop­ing the movie would pro­vide a boost for his cin­ema which, like many cin­e­mas around the world, has been deal­ing with a fall­ing num­ber of cin­ema­go­ers due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally a huge ef­fort to stay open right now for most of us, but we were as­sum­ing there would be some am­bi­tious movie releases in the com­ing weeks,” he was quoted by Dead­line as say­ing. “By los­ing Mu­lan, we lost the pos­si­bil­ity of of­fer­ing our au­di­ences a lon­gawaited film that would have helped us af­ter th­ese past hard weeks.”</p>
    <p>He was sur­prised by the over­whelm­ing re­ac­tion to his video, which has at­tracted more than 1.9 mil­lion views as of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In the vi­ral video, the movie poster of di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan’s sci-fi ac­tion fea­ture film Tenet was seen be­hind the fallen pop-up ad­ver­tise­ment for Mu­lan.</p>
    <p>Mr Le­moine hoped Tenet would be re­leased on Aug 26 as sched­uled.</p>
    <p>“We thank Warner a lot for re­leas­ing Tenet in late Au­gust. But it’s not enough,” he said. “Stu­dios need to un­der­stand that if they can­cel th­ese films or put them on plat­forms, I won’t be able to last very long.”</p>
    <p>He is not the only cin­ema owner an­gered by Dis­ney’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Cin­ema own­ers in Bri­tain told Dead­line they were blind­sided by Dis­ney’s move, with one movie ex­hibitor de­scrib­ing it as “cruel” and another ac­cus­ing Dis­ney of “tak­ing all the rev­enue” by mov­ing Mu­lan to its stream­ing plat­form.</p>
