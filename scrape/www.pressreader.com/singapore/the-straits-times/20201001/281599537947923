    <p>She may be 88 years old, but Madam Chua Meow Ching still puts in 10 hours a day at the kway chap stall she runs five days a week. The hawker has been sell­ing the dish for the past 56 years and still gets up at 3.30am on the days she opens her stall.</p>
    <p>When asked why she is still work­ing, Madam Chua, who runs Covent Gar­den Kway Chap in Have­lock Road Food Cen­tre with her two sons, said in Teochew: “I’m wor­ried my sons can­not cope with­out me. So I help them.”</p>
    <p>Madam Chua, who never went to school, was born in Swa­tow prov­ince in China. When she was 23, she came to Sin­ga­pore to join her hus­band, to whom she was match-made.</p>
    <p>With six chil­dren to raise, she be­came a hawker to sup­ple­ment the fam­ily in­come. Her late hus­band was a sailor and held sev­eral other jobs, but it was al­ways tough mak­ing ends meet on their small in­comes, she said.</p>
    <p>She sells kway chap be­cause she loves eat­ing it. The dish com­prises an as­sort­ment of stewed of­fal and is served with a bowl of rice sheets called kway in a light soup.</p>
    <p>Each day af­ter break­fast, she takes a five-minute walk to start work at her stall, which opens for busi­ness at 6am.</p>
    <p>As she got older, her two sons took over the cook­ing, while she chops up the food for sale. They call it a day when they are sold out, which is of­ten by 1pm.</p>
    <p>Madam Chua lives with her el­dest son, a bach­e­lor, and does the house­hold chores and cooks din­ner when she gets home. She likes to watch a bit of Korean drama on TV and she is usu­ally in bed by 8pm or 9pm.</p>
    <p>On Sun­days and Mon­days when the stall is closed, Madam Chua likes to take a bus to ex­plore mar­kets lo­cated in dif­fer­ent parts of the is­land.</p>
    <p>Her el­dest child, Mr Er Soo Khim, said his mother is healthy, al­though she has to wear a hear­ing aid as her hear­ing is af­fected with age.</p>
    <p>Mr Er, 65, who works with his mum, said: “She eats light meals, such as por­ridge, and she cooks her own food. She is also very ac­tive, healthy and hardly falls ill.”</p>
    <p>Madam Chua, who has four grand­chil­dren, is think­ing of re­tir­ing soon as she has to go for cataract surgery in De­cem­ber. “I’m old. My body and my legs ache,” she said. “Life was hard in the past, but now I don’t have to worry about food and other things.”</p>
