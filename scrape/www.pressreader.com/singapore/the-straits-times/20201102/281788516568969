    <p>By most stan­dards, 26-year-old Yang Yang is much like any other young par­ent liv­ing in China’s ci­ties.</p>
    <p>He frets over whether his three chil­dren will be able to go to good schools and whether he can make enough money to raise them and put a roof over their heads.</p>
    <p>But, un­like his city-dwelling coun­ter­parts, Mr Yang lives in a re­mote moun­tain vil­lage in Sichuan prov­ince, where th­ese con­cerns can seem more press­ing.</p>
    <p>Home for his fam­ily of five is Atulie’er vil­lage in Liang­shan Yi Au­ton­o­mous Pre­fec­ture, a moun­tain­ous area criss­crossed by ridges and val­leys. It is also known as China’s “cliff vil­lage” – so-called be</p>
    <p>cause it is perched atop a moun­tain 1,500m above sea level and ac­ces­si­ble only by climb­ing a se­ries of steel lad­ders.</p>
    <p>At night, when it rains, Mr Yang wor­ries that his mud hut will come crash­ing down as his fam­ily sleeps.</p>
    <p>The only pre-school in the vil­lage has closed, since half of the res­i­dents have been re­lo­cated down the moun­tain ear­lier this year as part of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s poverty al­le­vi­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The coron­avirus pan­demic has added to his woes: The au­thor­i­ties sus­pended the move­ment of goods and peo­ple ear­lier this year to curb the spread of Covid-19, so vil­lagers have not been able to sell their pro­duce, made up mostly of green pep­per­corns and wal­nuts.</p>
    <p>“For us vil­lagers, this is our main source of in­come. If we can’t sell any­thing, we don’t have any money,” said Mr Yang when The Straits Times re­cently vis­ited him at home.</p>
    <p>The crop of pep­per­corns and wal­nuts on the fam­ily farm nets up­wards of 10,000 yuan (S$2,041) in nor­mal years. This year, how­ever, his fam­ily sold noth­ing.</p>
    <p>But Mr Yang is still luck­ier than most. He re­cently started rear­ing goats, and has a steady job – look­ing af­ter an olive orchard on the slopes of his vil­lage – that brings in 2,000 yuan a month. It is not much, but the sum is enough to pay the fam­ily’s mo­bile phone bills, as well as buy rice and cig­a­rettes.</p>
    <p>With the coron­avirus out­break un­der con­trol in China, ci­ties and fac­to­ries have come roar­ing back to life, and Beijing has been keen to paint a pic­ture that it is on the road to re­cov­ery while the rest of the world con­tin­ues to grap­ple with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But the plight of Mr Yang and other ru­ral res­i­dents un­der­scores the un­even na­ture of China’s post­pan­demic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have warned of the pan­demic’s im­pact on the poor, with the World Bank es­ti­mat­ing in a re­cent re­port it could push up to 115 mil­lion peo­ple poverty this year.</p>
    <p>The Liang­shan pre­fec­ture is one of the most im­pov­er­ished re­gions in Sichuan prov­ince. The moun­tain­ous area is home to the Yi eth­nic mi­nor­ity. It is also the home of 178,000 of the 200,000 peo­ple in Sichuan clas­si­fied by Beijing as ex­tremely poor.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in­sist, how­ever, that the worst is over – even though they ac­knowl­edge that the pan­demic has af­fected the pre­fec­ture badly.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 out­break and the en­su­ing lock­down kept mi­grant work­ers, who came home for the Chi­nese New Year hol­i­day, from re­turn­ing to their work­places in into ex­treme other prov­inces, and stopped tourists from vis­it­ing, said pre­fec­ture party sec­re­tary Lin Shucheng.</p>
    <p>But the provin­cial gov­ern­ment man­aged to keep the im­pact to the “low­est level pos­si­ble”, he said, by bussing mi­grant work­ers back to their work in other prov­inces, cre­at­ing tem­po­rary re­place­ment jobs within Sichuan, and giv­ing them ad­vice on boost­ing yields and in­comes from farm­ing.</p>
    <p>He and other of­fi­cials point to Mr Yang’s cliff vil­lage as an ex­am­ple of how Sichuan has shrugged off the pan­demic, put­ting its devel­op­ment and poverty al­le­vi­a­tion goals back on track.</p>
    <p>Sichuan’s party boss Peng Qinghua, the top provin­cial of­fi­cial, told a press con­fer­ence in Septem­ber: “In the vil­lage there are guest­houses and tourism be­ing de­vel­oped, it has be­come a must-visit spot for in­flu­encers.”</p>
    <p>The 200-year-old vil­lage has a rep­u­ta­tion on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia as an off-the-tourist-track spot for those keen to see what life atop a cliff vil­lage is like.</p>
    <p>The vil­lage burst onto the scene af­ter it made head­lines both within China and in­ter­na­tion­ally in 2016, when pic­tures of chil­dren de­scend­ing rick­ety wooden lad­ders to get to school cap­tured the world’s at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>It spurred Beijing to take ac­tion, as it swiftly built steel lad­ders and stairs with rail­ings in their place. Mod­ern ameni­ties like elec­tric­ity and a telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions tower were also built.</p>
    <p>But, apart from that, lit­tle else has changed, said vil­lagers.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang’s younger brother Yang</p>
    <p>Jun­jie said that other than the re­cently built steel lad­ders, the vil­lage is in the same con­di­tion it has been for years.</p>
    <p>“If you want to de­velop this place, you need to de­velop a trans­port net­work and have a way to get goods up the moun­tain,” said the younger Mr Yang, 19.</p>
    <p>It is a pe­cu­liar sit­u­a­tion – the vil­lage now has elec­tric­ity and a light­ning-fast 4G sig­nal, but ac­ces­si­bil­ity, which vil­lagers said was their cen­tral prob­lem, re­mains a big is­sue.</p>
    <p>With­out roads or other means to get goods up to their homes, ev­ery­thing from fruits to veg­eta­bles to re­frig­er­a­tors have to be car­ried up the moun­tain – a two-hour climb in fair weather.</p>
    <p>When ST vis­ited Atulie’er i n Septem­ber, the vil­lage seemed a far cry from the hub of ac­tiv­ity that of­fi­cials de­scribed. Many homes were de­serted and there were only a hand­ful of vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Half or 84 of the fam­i­lies liv­ing atop the moun­tain were re­lo­cated to new apart­ments near the county seat of Zhao­jue – 75km away – un­der the coun­try’s anti-poverty cam­paign ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Many of those re­main­ing are not clas­si­fied as im­pov­er­ished fam­i­lies – like the Yangs – and have been told to stay put to help de­velop the tourism in­dus­try in the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>But, with­out proper in­fra­struc­ture, cou­pled with the im­pact on their in­comes from the pan­demic, vil­lagers are wor­ried about the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Jan Kar­lach, re­search fel­low at The Ori­en­tal In­sti­tute of the Czech Repub­lic’s Academy of Sciences, points out that while few vil­lages in Liang­shan are as “cut off from the world”, its sit­u­a­tion shows the chal­lenges China faces in help­ing its poor­est.</p>
    <p>He said there is a lot of fo­cus on erad­i­cat­ing ab­so­lute poverty to sup­port Beijing’s of­fi­cial nar­ra­tive on how China has beat Covid-19 and has its econ­omy on the mend, but in Atulie’er and other vil­lages there is this group of the “near poor” who are not feel­ing the ben­e­fits of the eco­nomic re­bound and might be at risk of fall­ing back into ab­so­lute poverty.</p>
    <p>“The fore­most pri­or­ity now is to take ab­so­lute poverty down to zero... I’ve seen very lit­tle talk on how to pre­vent house­holds lifted from poverty from fall­ing back again,” he said.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing just how se­vere Covid-19 has af­fected China’s ru­ral poor, a study last month by Stan­ford Univer­sity’s Ru­ral Ed­u­ca­tion Ac­tion Pro­gramme showed that pan­demic con­trol mea­sures had caused vil­lagers in China to lose al­most a fifth of their an­nual in­come, at a time when costs of com­mon goods were ris­ing, and caused many to bor­row money from friends and rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>It also found that the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s mea­sures to help the ru­ral poor were in­ad­e­quate, and were in­stead fo­cused on busi­nesses and land­lords.</p>
    <p>For now, all the el­der Mr Yang can do is wait. He said the gov­ern­ment has plans to build a ca­ble­way to get goods up the moun­tain, and also build guest­houses, but his chil­dren – who have to go to school – and fam­ily can­not wait.</p>
    <p>“We don’t know when th­ese things will hap­pen. The gov­ern­ment doesn’t seem to be in a hurry. But for us, this is ur­gent,” he said.</p>
