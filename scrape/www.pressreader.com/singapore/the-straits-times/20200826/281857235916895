    <p>As the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion faces law­suits against its i mpend­ing bans on WeChat and TikTok, Wash­ing­ton’s moves against the two Chi­nese so­cial me­dia apps have also touched a nerve in China.</p>
    <p>The bans, which take ef­fect on Sept 20, have been a hot topic for dis­cus­sion in the past weeks, with Chi­nese me­dia and ne­ti­zens say­ing the United States is out to bully and sup­press China’s grow­ing tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The question now on observers’ minds is whether the public sen­ti­ment would lead to boy­cotts of Amer­i­can brands in China, as some ne­ti­zens have threat­ened.</p>
    <p>On Monday, TikTok and one of its em­ploy­ees had sep­a­rately sued the US gov­ern­ment over an ex­ec­u­tive or­der ban­ning trans­ac­tions in the US with the pop­u­lar short video-shar­ing app.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on its web­site, TikTok, owned by ByteDance, called the de­ci­sion “heav­ily politi­cised” and said it ig­nored the com­pany’s ef­forts to prove it does not share data with Bei­jing and is not a na­tional se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>“The ex­ec­u­tive or­der is not rooted in bona fide na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns. In­de­pen­dent na­tional se­cu­rity and in­for­ma­tion se­cu­rity ex­perts have crit­i­cised the po­lit­i­cal na­ture of this ex­ec­u­tive or­der, and ex­pressed doubt as to whether its stated na­tional se­cu­rity ob­jec­tive is gen­uine,” said TikTok in the com­plaint filed with the US fed­eral court.</p>
    <p>It is seek­ing a per­ma­nent in­junc­tion to block the ex­ec­u­tive or­der from be­ing en­forced, al­leg­ing that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion vi­o­lated its con­sti­tu­tional right to due process by ban­ning the com­pany with­out op­por­tu­nity to re­spond to ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>TikTok em­ployee Pa­trick Ryan, a tech­ni­cal pro­gramme man­ager, also sued the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion over con­cerns that he and his 1,500 colleagues – many on em­ploy­ment visas – will lose their jobs if the or­der is en­forced.</p>
    <p>Last Friday, a group of WeChat users in the US also launched a le­gal chal­lenge against a sim­i­lar ex­ec­u­tive or­der against the Chi­nese mes­sag­ing app, say­ing it would bar ac­cess in the coun­try to WeChat, which they use for busi­ness and com­mu­ni­ca­tion. WeChat is owned by Chi­nese In­ter­net gi­ant Ten­cent.</p>
    <p>On Chi­nese mi­cro-blog­ging plat­form Weibo, the is­sue has been one of the top trend­ing top­ics.</p>
    <p>The top­ics “Chi­nese for­eign min­istry re­sponds to TikTok’s law­suit against the US gov­ern­ment” and “How to view this TikTok episode” have drawn hun­dreds of mil­lions of views, with na­tion­al­is­tic com­ments like “We should sup­port ef­forts to pro­tect our rights!” and “The US is out to sup­press Chi­nese firms” com­mon on many threads.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­cles say­ing the US is shoot­ing it­self in the foot and that Chi­nese con­sumers could re­tal­i­ate against US busi­nesses have also been cir­cu­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>“Apart from Apple, com­monly seen brands like KFC, McDon­ald’s and Star­bucks will also be af­fected to vary­ing de­grees. Many Amer­i­can busi­nesses are wor­ry­ing if it will be dif­fi­cult for them to stand on their feet in the Chi­nese mar­ket,” said one on­line com­men­ta­tor.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has not dis­cour­aged such sen­ti­ments from emerg­ing. Said for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian on Monday: “Cer­tain politi­cians in the US are afraid of the strength and suc­cess of non-US com­pa­nies and so they do not hes­i­tate to use na­tional power to sup­press them in ev­ery pos­si­ble way.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides Ten­cent and ByteDance, the US has also sanc­tioned telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion firms Huawei and ZTE.</p>
    <p>Tech an­a­lyst Andy Mok said: “The US looms large in the Chi­nese imag­i­na­tion... and I think many Chi­nese feel be­trayed be­cause the US has long por­trayed it­self as be­ing open and fair,” said the se­nior re­search fel­low at the Cen­tre for China and Glob­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“Even if there isn’t a wide­spread boy­cott (of US brands), this could be dam­ag­ing to Amer­i­can busi­nesses in China,” he said.</p>
    <p>The top­ics “Chi­nese for­eign min­istry re­sponds to TikTok’s law­suit against the US gov­ern­ment” and “How to view this TikTok episode”, have drawn hun­dreds of mil­lions of views, with na­tion­al­is­tic com­ments like “We should sup­port ef­forts to pro­tect our rights!” and “The US is out to sup­press Chi­nese firms” com­mon on many threads.</p>
