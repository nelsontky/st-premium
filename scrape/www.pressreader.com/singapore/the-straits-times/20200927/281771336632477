    <p>Cy­cling or even walk­ing from East Coast Park to Changi Beach Park could soon be a more com­fort­able and en­rich­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, as plans are afoot for a 15km-long green cor­ri­dor that will con­nect both parks.</p>
    <p>The new cen­tral green cor­ri­dor will run along New Up­per Changi Road and Loyang Way, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day, and will also con­nect to other parks and gar­dens in the area via a net­work of com­mu­nity cor­ri­dors.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents can also ex­pect more na­ture-based ameni­ties to be built and con­nected to this green net­work in the east, with plans for more com­mu­nity and ther­a­peu­tic gar­dens, and na­ture play gar­dens for chil­dren, said Mr Heng, who is an MP for East Coast GRC.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on the side­lines of a com­mu­nity event held on Pu­lau Ubin, which is part of the con­stituency, he said: “I look for­ward to part­ner­ing our peo­ple, es­pe­cially res­i­dents of East Coast, to turn th­ese plans into re­al­ity. We will reach out to you soon to gather your ideas and vi­sion for th­ese green spa­ces.”</p>
    <p>There is no time­line yet for when the green cor­ri­dor will be ready.</p>
    <p>But in un­veil­ing the plans for how the east­ern part of the is­land will be made greener in line with the na­tion’s City in Na­ture as­pi­ra­tions, Mr Heng said the new cen­tral green cor­ri­dor, as well as the net­work of com­mu­nity cor­ri­dors, will be lined with a va­ri­ety of na­tive trees and shrubs so they re­sem­ble the look and feel of nat­u­ral forests.</p>
    <p>The lush green­ery will pro­vide a cooler and more com­fort­able ex­pe­ri­ence for pedes­tri­ans and cyclists, he said.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese cor­ri­dors will also con­nect our pock­ets of green space and en­hance their over­all bio­di­ver­sity,” he added.</p>
    <p>In a video mes­sage posted on Face­book, Mr Heng spoke at the Changi Point Ferry Ter­mi­nal, where he took a bum­boat ride to Pu­lau Ubin to mark Ubin Day, an event or­gan­ised to cel­e­brate the rich na­ture and cul­ture of the rus­tic is­land.</p>
    <p>The first two Ubin Days were cel­e­brated in 2002 and 2003.</p>
    <p>But it was not un­til 2014, when the Friends of Ubin Net­work – com­pris­ing vil­lagers, academics, and na­ture and her­itage en­thu­si­asts – was formed, that Ubin Day be­came an an­nual tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said the net­work brought to­gether di­verse per­spec­tives and has helped to turn good ideas into ac­tion, with the com­mu­nity im­ple­ment­ing many pro­grammes over the years, in­clud­ing Ubin Day it­self.</p>
    <p>“This is the spirit of Sin­ga­pore To­gether. And I hope we can part­ner more Sin­ga­pore­ans to build our fu­ture Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous edi­tions of Ubin Day, there were ac­tiv­i­ties rang­ing from kayak­ing to na­ture walks, as well as film screen­ings and kam­pung games. But due to the Covid-19 out­break this year, Web talks on the is­land’s rich his­tory and cul­ture were held in­stead.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that more Sin­ga­pore­ans have been ven­tur­ing into the coun­try’s green spa­ces since the start of the out­break, Mr Heng said: “As we emerge from this cri­sis, we must con­tinue to grow, and even ac­cel­er­ate, our green­ing ef­fort.”</p>
    <p>CON­NECT­ING GREEN SPA­CES</p>
    <p>I look for­ward to part­ner­ing our peo­ple, es­pe­cially res­i­dents of East Coast, to turn th­ese plans into re­al­ity... Th­ese cor­ri­dors will also con­nect our pock­ets of green space and en­hance their over­all bio­di­ver­sity.</p>
