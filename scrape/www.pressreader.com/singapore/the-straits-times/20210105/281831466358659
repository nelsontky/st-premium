    <p>Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha yes­ter­day over­ruled Bangkok of­fi­cials’ at­tempt to fight the es­ca­lat­ing Covid-19 pan­demic by lim­it­ing restau­rant din­ing hours, even as the coun­try recorded 745 new in­fec­tions – its sin­gle big­gest daily in­crease.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want there to be more eco­nomic im­pact than nec­es­sary,” he told a press yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, just hours af­ter the Bangkok Metropoli­tan Ad­min­is­tra­tion (BMA) an­nounced that eater­ies would be able to sell food and drink for take­away only from 7pm to 6am, start­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>With the swift re­peal, Bangkok’s res­tau­rants can con­tinue to serve dine-in pa­trons for two more hours, un­til 9pm.</p>
    <p>While Thai­land was a front run­ner in the fight against Covid-19 in the re­gion last year af­ter a bruis­ing month-long lock­down, new in­fec­tions em­a­nat­ing from a prawn mar­ket in Sa­mut Sakhon prov­ince last month have put the coun­try on the edge again.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients are now found in 54 prov­inces and much of cen­tral Thai­land in­clud­ing Bangkok – all of which are clas­si­fied as high-risk or “red” zones.</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment venues are shut and schools closed na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Yet, wary of tak­ing the wind out of a nascent eco­nomic re­cov­ery, Mr Prayut has shied away from ban­ning do­mes­tic travel.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he has ap­pealed for peo­ple to stay home.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to lock the en­tire coun­try down,” he told re­porters ear­lier yes­ter­day. “Isn’t it bet­ter if we lock our­selves down? If we don’t want to get in­fected, then stay home for 14 to 15 days… It will be eas­ier for screen­ing.”</p>
    <p>In any case, the au­thor­i­ties in in­di­vid­ual prov­inces, em­pow­ered by the emer­gency de­cree in place, have started erect­ing en­try bar­ri­ers to peo­ple com­ing from the na­tion’s worst-hit zones.</p>
    <p>Nakhon Ratchasima prov­ince, a pop­u­lar week­end get­away for Bangkok res­i­dents, now re­quires trav­ellers from “red” zones to re­port for quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Chon­buri’s pop­u­lar re­sort is­land of Koh Larn made all tourists leave by the end of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Two ma­jor clus­ters in­volve mi­grant work­ers and pa­trons of an il­le­gal gam­bling den, rais­ing fears that those in­fected may re­main in hid­ing for fear of be­ing ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Still, restau­ra­teurs have been lob­by­ing the govern­ment to keep their busi­nesses open.</p>
    <p>“De­ci­sions on res­tau­rants af­fect not just us, but also the fresh food mar­kets and the agri­cul­tural sec­tor,” Thai Restau­rant As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Tani­wan Koon­mongkon told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Al­co­hol con­sump­tion is now for­bid­den in Bangkok res­tau­rants.</p>
    <p>BMA spokesman Pongsakorn Kwan­muang said yes­ter­day: “Al­co­hol con­sump­tion may cause peo­ple to linger in res­tau­rants. It also en­cour­ages gath­er­ings.”</p>
    <p>In its most re­cent forecast, the Na­tional Eco­nomic and So­cial De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil said the Thai econ­omy would con­tract 6 per cent last year. With most for­eign tourists shut out, Thai­land’s vis­i­tor num­bers from January to Novem­ber plunged by 81 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Thai of­fi­cials said the coun­try will re­ceive its first Covid-19 vac­cines by next month from China’s Si­no­vac Biotech, re­ported Reuters.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a tweet by Mr Prayut’s of­fice, he said Thai­land has or­dered two mil­lion doses from Si­no­vac and is ex­pected to re­ceive the first batch of 200,000 in one to two months.</p>
    <p>Thai­land also sealed a deal for lo­cal firm Siam Bio­science to pro­duce a vac­cine de­vel­oped by Bri­tish phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm As­traZeneca.</p>
