    <p>NEW YORK • France’s Benoit Paire has pulled out of the US Open, which started yes­ter­day, af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, French sports daily L’Equipe re­ported.</p>
    <p>The 23rd-ranked player, who was the 17th seed at the hard­court Grand Slam, had been sched­uled to play Poland’s Kamil Ma­jchrzak in the first round at Flush­ing Mead­ows to­day.</p>
    <p>While Paire has yet to con­firm his diagnosis on so­cial me­dia, his name was scratched from the list of seeds on the of­fi­cial web­site on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The men’s draw in­stead showed Ma­jchrzak would play Spain’s Mar­cel Gra­nollers.</p>
    <p>A United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion spokesman said he could “only con­firm that a player has tested pos­i­tive and has been with­drawn”.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old Paire ar­rived in New York to play the Western and South­ern Open last week, the fi­nal tune-up event be­fore the US Open, but he did not fin­ish his first-round match against Croa­tia’s Borna Coric.</p>
    <p>He ap­peared un­well dur­ing the match and asked for a doc­tor in the open­ing set be­fore re­tir­ing in the sec­ond while trail­ing 6-0, 1-0.</p>
    <p>L’Equipe re­ported fel­low French­men Richard Gas­quet, Gre­goire Bar­rere, Edouard Roger-Vas­selin and Adrian Man­nar­ino were also asked to self-iso­late in their ho­tel rooms fol­low­ing the pos­i­tive test.</p>
    <p>As many as 11 play­ers had con­tact with Paire, but world No. 28 Alex de Min­aur yes­ter­day told The Aus­tralian via Face­book Live chat they were all given “spe­cial pro­to­cols” to pro­ceed with their matches.</p>
    <p>The US Open is be­ing played with­out fans and in a bio-se­cure “bub­ble” due to the pan­demic, but sev­eral high-rank­ing men and women’s play­ers have still de­cided to skip the tour­na­ment be­cause of health con­cerns.</p>
    <p>De­spite Paire’s in­fec­tion be­ing picked up while inside the “bub­ble”, world No. 3 Do­minic Thiem told re­porters he still felt con­fi­dent about the level of safety at the event.</p>
    <p>“There is no safer place in the world right now than here,” said the Aus­trian. “Maybe you can lock your­self some­where in a cave or some­thing, in the mid­dle of the sea. Oth­er­wise, it’s su­per safe here.</p>
    <p>“Still some­thing can hap­pen, as you could see with Benoit. We hope that no­body else is i nfected.”</p>
