    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan was hit by its big­gest eco­nomic con­trac­tion on record in the sec­ond quar­ter as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic crushed con­sump­tion and ex­ports, keep­ing pol­i­cy­mak­ers un­der pres­sure for bolder ac­tion to pre­vent a deeper re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The third straight quar­ter of de­clines knocked the size of real gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) to decade­low lev­els, wip­ing out the ben­e­fits brought by Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s “Abe­nomics” stim­u­lus poli­cies de­ployed in late 2012.</p>
    <p>While the econ­omy is emerg­ing from the dol­drums af­ter lock­downs were lifted in late May, many an­a­lysts ex­pect any re­bound in the cur­rent quar­ter to be mod­est as a re­newed rise in in­fec­tions keeps con­sumers’ purse strings tight.</p>
    <p>“The big de­cline can be ex­plained by the de­crease in con­sump­tion and ex­ports,” said Mr Takeshi Mi­nami, chief econ­o­mist at Nor­inchukin Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect growth to turn pos­i­tive in the July-Septem­ber quar­ter. But glob­ally, the re­bound is slug­gish ev­ery­where ex­cept for China.”</p>
    <p>The world’s third-largest econ­omy shrank an an­nu­alised 27.8 per cent in April to June, govern­ment data showed yes­ter­day, mark­ing the big­gest de­cline since com­pa­ra­ble data be­came avail­able in 1980, and slightly big­ger than a me­dian mar­ket forecast for a 27.2 per cent drop.</p>
    <p>While the con­trac­tion was smaller than a 32.9 per cent de­crease in the United States, it was much big­ger than a 17.8 per cent fall Ja­pan suf­fered in the first quar­ter of 2009, when the col­lapse of Lehman Broth­ers jolted global fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The size of Ja­pan’s real GDP shrank to 485 tril­lion yen (S$6.25 tril­lion), the low­est since April-June 2011, when Ja­pan was still suf­fer­ing from two decades of de­fla­tion and eco­nomic stag­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The main cul­prit be­hind the dis­mal read­ing was pri­vate con­sump­tion, which plunged a record 8.2</p>
