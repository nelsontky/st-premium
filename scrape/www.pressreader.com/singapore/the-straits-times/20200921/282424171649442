    <p>Madam Ah­sathia­mal Subra­ma­nian, 65, has di­a­betes. The di­ag­no­sis two years ago means she has all five risk fac­tors for metabolic syn­drome, which puts her at se­ri­ous risk of de­vel­op­ing chronic con­di­tions such as heart dis­ease and stroke.</p>
    <p>Over the years, she has also been found to have hy­per­ten­sion, high triglyc­eride lev­els, low lev­els of good choles­terol and ex­cess fat around the waist as she is over­weight, the four other risk fac­tors.</p>
    <p>A di­ag­no­sis of metabolic syn­drome re­quires one to have three of the fac­tors.</p>
    <p>The re­tiree is one of many se­niors in Sin­ga­pore who have metabolic syn­drome.</p>
    <p>A study con­ducted by re­searchers from the National Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine’s Depart­ment of Medicine showed that metabolic syn­drome af­fected al­most one in two peo­ple aged 65 and above, with a higher preva­lence in women than men above 70 years old.</p>
    <p>Eight in 10 women above the age of 85 were found to have the syn­drome.</p>
    <p>The study, which took place be­tween April 2015 and Au­gust 2016, eval­u­ated 722 par­tic­i­pants in Sin­ga­pore aged 65 and above.</p>
    <p>The find­ings were pub­lished in Dove Med­i­cal Press, a pub­lisher of peer-re­viewed sci­en­tific and med­i­cal jour­nals, in July this year.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Reshma Mer­chant from NUS Medicine, who was one of the leads in the study and au­thored the pa­per, said: “With age­ing, there is in­creased preva­lence of chronic dis­eases, higher fatty tis­sue and lower mus­cle mass which puts older adults at a higher risk of get­ting metabolic syn­drome. A seden­tary life­style and lack of ex­er­cise or man­ual work also puts them at an in­creased risk.”</p>
    <p>In Madam Subra­ma­nian’s case, a hec­tic work life, in­clud­ing a pun­ish­ing daily shut­tle be­tween Telok Blan­gah where she lives and Jo­hor Baru where she was a vice-prin­ci­pal at a pri­mary school, gave her a false sense that she was ac­tive.</p>
    <p>In fact, she had of­ten felt giddy and could not stand up for too long with­out feel­ing faint. When she con­sulted a doc­tor about her giddy spells 20 years ago, she was found to have hy­per­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>There are also eth­nic dif­fer­ences in the preva­lence of metabolic syn­drome, with more than one in two In­di­ans suf­fer­ing from the con­di­tion as com­pared with one in three Chi­nese and one in two Malays.</p>
    <p>Prof Mer­chant said there may be a ge­netic in­flu­ence on how fat is distribute­d in dif­fer­ent eth­nic groups.</p>
    <p>“In­di­ans and maybe Malays tend to have higher body fat or ab­dom­i­nal obe­sity even at a nor­mal range of body mass in­dex. Ab­dom­i­nal obe­sity or in­creased vis­ceral fat in In­di­ans is a marker of the pres­ence of in­sulin re­sis­tance, which is a risk fac­tor for hy­per­ten­sion, Type 2 di­a­betes and heart dis­ease... Metabolic syn­drome can de­velop af­ter a pro­longed state of in­sulin re­sis­tance,” she said.</p>
    <p>In­sulin re­sis­tance means t he body does not use i nsulin ef­fi­ciently to lower glu­cose and triglyc­eride lev­els.</p>
    <p>Prof Mer­chant, who is the head and se­nior con­sul­tant at the National Uni­ver­sity Hos­pi­tal’s Di­vi­sion of Ge­ri­atric Medicine, said: “In in­sulin re­sis­tance, the in­sulin re­cep­tors which act as the door­man guard­ing glu­cose en­try into the cells be­come de­sen­si­tised. As the in­sulin re­leased in re­sponse to meals is not so ef­fec­tive, the body ini­tially pro­duces more in­sulin which can cause higher blood pres­sure, blood fats, in­flam­ma­tion, blood clot­ting, and fat stor­age in the body.”</p>
    <p>If left un­ad­dressed, the ar­ter­ies can be dam­aged, lead­ing to stiff­ness, cal­cium de­po­si­tion and plaque for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The NUS re­searchers also found a weaker hand grip strength among se­niors to be an in­di­ca­tor of metabolic syn­drome.</p>
    <p>Ad­junct As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Sa­muel Chew, se­nior con­sul­tant at Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal’s Depart­ment of Ge­ri­atric Medicine, who read the find­ings of the study, said the com­po­nents which make up metabolic syn­drome such as the loss of sen­si­tiv­ity to in­sulin may be a re­sult of poor mus­cle health.</p>
    <p>“This is be­cause mus­cles are a ma­jor con­trib­u­tor in the reg­u­la­tion of glu­cose me­tab­o­lism in the body. Healthy mus­cles re­lease and en­hance the func­tion­ing of hor­mones and other me­di­a­tors of glu­cose me­tab­o­lism.”</p>
    <p>Prof Mer­chant noted that the loss of mus­cle mass and strength due to age­ing, also known as sar­cope­nia, is as­so­ci­ated with a two-fold in­creased risk of metabolic syn­drome.</p>
    <p>Madam Subra­ma­nian, who has two daugh­ters aged 34 and 27, said that her “mus­cles are not as strong as be­fore” and she has been feel­ing aches and pains in her shoul­ders when she car­ries heavy things.</p>
    <p>The good news is that metabolic syn­drome is re­versible. The key to do­ing so is weight loss and ex­er­cise, which work to­gether to lower blood pres­sure and choles­terol and help im­prove in­sulin re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Prof Chew said life­style and di­etary changes are im­por­tant to im­prove and man­age the con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Madam Subra­ma­nian has been ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly by do­ing zumba, low-im­pact aer­o­bics and yoga and tak­ing brisk walks in the park.</p>
    <p>She also takes part in a phys­i­cal ex­er­cise pro­gramme called Healthy Age­ing Pro­mo­tion Pro­gramme For You (Happy), which helps se­niors im­prove their men­tal well-be­ing, mem­ory, func­tional abil­ity and strength through var­i­ous ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>This has helped her lose 4kg over two years. She has also man­aged to bring her blood pres­sure down to a nor­mal level and is main­tain­ing a healthy level of sugar in­take by watch­ing her diet.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve I have to con­tinue to keep my­self ac­tive so that the aches don’t set in,” she said.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Ng Moy Loang, who has hy­per­ten­sion, low lev­els of good choles­terol and is over­weight, also takes part in the Happy pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant for se­niors like us to be phys­i­cally ac­tive so that we can avoid health prob­lems. Reg­u­lar ex­er­cise has helped to in­crease the lev­els of my good choles­terol and lower my high blood pres­sure,” said the 69-year-old, who was a pro­duc­tion plan­ner in a print­ing firm.</p>
    <p>The mother of three daugh­ters aged 42, 39 and 26 also tries to keep to a healthy diet of less sat­u­rated fats and more fruit and veg­eta­bles.</p>
