    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your ter­rific en­ergy helps you seize the ini­tia­tive and push things for­ward. You may find that you are bet­ter able to con­vince peo­ple that your ideas are the best.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Open up to new peo­ple to­day. Al­lies are al­ways handy, even if you think you are in a po­si­tion of power. Make sure the right peo­ple know that you are glad to have them around.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are tak­ing your jokes too se­ri­ously, so you should ease up. It is not as much fun, of course, but it is sure to keep ev­ery­one fo­cused on what needs to get done.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You want more and you de­serve it. En­sure that you are al­low­ing for more of what­ever good stuff has been com­ing your way, and try to open the door to some­thing new.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your emo­tional side is per­fect for the day’s needs. You could find that at least a friend or fam­ily mem­ber needs your help. Open your heart and make life bet­ter for all.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You have too many tasks to do and it is time to cut back. Your en­ergy is not lim­it­less, so spend some time pri­ori­tis­ing early to­day and you should be fine later on.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are look­ing to you for an­swers, so give them what they want. It is all about em­pa­thy and you have plenty of that. Lis­ten, think and then dis­pense wis­dom.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>A snag at work or in a job search makes you ques­tion your ca­reer choices. Now is not a good time to make a big move, but your think­ing leads you in fas­ci­nat­ing di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You need to get out in the world and ex­plore. Your amaz­ing en­ergy is per­fect for new ideas, new peo­ple and new places. If you can­not do it phys­i­cally, go on­line.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Do not take every­thing at face value. Some folks are not be­ing to­tally hon­est. While they are not go­ing to un­der­mine you, you will still need some scep­ti­cism.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You could be caught in the mid­dle of a power strug­gle. Try to choose a side or get out of the line of fire. Things are sure to heat up be­fore the end of the day.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>It is time to get real. Your en­ergy is a lit­tle scat­tered, but that could mean you have to get se­ri­ous about pac­ing your­self. Things are start­ing to come into fo­cus.</p>
