    <p>The first case of Covid-19 was re­ported in China over seven months ago, with Sin­ga­pore record­ing its first in­fec­tion on Jan 23. Six months on, the pan­demic is still far from over, ex­perts are warn­ing, and in­fec­tions have gath­ered pace.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, there are now more than 13 mil­lion con­firmed cases and over half a mil­lion deaths.</p>
    <p>While some coun­tries like China and New Zealand have be­gun to re­turn to a sense of nor­malcy, oth­ers like the United States and Brazil con­tinue to re­port high num­bers of new cases daily. A num­ber of coun­tries have also seen a resur­gence in cases af­ter a pe­riod of re­port­ing few or no cases.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will hit the six-month mark on Thurs­day. On that day, The Straits Times will host an on­line we­bi­nar with a panel of ex­perts who will dis­cuss what we can ex­pect in the days ahead.</p>
    <p>The panel will con­sist of Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, who is dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health; Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal and chair of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work steer­ing com­mit­tee; and Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy direc­tor of the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School who is work­ing on Covid-19 treat­ments and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>ST’s se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik will mod­er­ate the dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>Some of the top­ics to be dis­cussed in­clude what sci­en­tists have learnt about the virus and what the resur­gence in cases overseas means for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Health Min­istry said Sin­ga­pore can learn use­ful lessons from the ex­pe­ri­ences of coun­tries that have seen a spike in cases af­ter they re­sumed nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties, such as what the key driv­ers of in­fec­tion are.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can also learn about the ef­fi­cacy of safe man­age­ment mea­sures and po­ten­tial gaps that could have led to out­breaks, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>It cited cases in Is­rael and Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state that were linked to non-com­pli­ance with so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, such as go­ing out while one is un­well or or­gan­is­ing large par­ties.</p>
    <p>“Clus­ters had also been ob­served in Hong Kong due to re­ported fall­ing com­pli­ance to mask-wear­ing in res­tau­rants and cafes,” the min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“There are also use­ful re­minders of the in­her­ent risk in set­tings where there is close, pro­longed con­tact among in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, South Korea re­ported clus­ters in re­li­gious gath­er­ings at churches, tem­ples and in work­places, while both South Korea and Tokyo, Ja­pan, re­ported clus­ters traced to nightlife es­tab­lish­ments.”</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong</p>
    <p>This pan­demic does look like it will be with us for some time... This dis­cus­sion aims to help our read­ers make sense of de­vel­op­ments and help them nav­i­gate the way for­ward for their fam­i­lies, busi­nesses and or­gan­i­sa­tions. told a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that trans­mis­sion in the gen­eral com­mu­nity here re­mains low de­spite an in­crease in the num­ber of such cases since Sin­ga­pore lifted cir­cuit breaker mea­sures a month and a half ago.</p>
    <p>“But this is not the time to cel­e­brate and be com­pla­cent. We are cer­tainly not out of the woods yet,” Mr Gan said, adding that the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has warned that the sit­u­a­tion could get worse un­less there is a col­lec­tive global ef­fort to con­trol the trans­mis­sion of the virus.</p>
    <p>“We must be pre­pared for a sec­ond wave too, but we must do our best to avoid it if we can,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, edi­tor-inchief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group and edi­tor of The Straits Times, said: “This pan­demic does look like it will be with us for some time, and we want to look back at what we have learnt about the virus over the past six months, and more im­por­tantly, where the ex­perts think we might be head­ing in this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“This dis­cus­sion aims to help our read­ers make sense of de­vel­op­ments and help them nav­i­gate the way for­ward for their fam­i­lies, busi­nesses and or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>The ST we­bi­nar will take place on the video con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom, and ST read­ers can sign up to at­tend at str.sg/covid19we­bi­nar</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion closes at noon on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Suc­cess­ful reg­is­trants will get the ac­cess code to at­tend and will be able to ask the panel ques­tions live. Those who are un­able to at­tend can send their ques­tions in ad­vance to askst@sph.com.sg with “ST Covid-19 We­bi­nar” in the sub­ject line.</p>
    <p>A record­ing of the dis­cus­sion will also be made avail­able on­line af­ter the we­bi­nar ends.</p>
