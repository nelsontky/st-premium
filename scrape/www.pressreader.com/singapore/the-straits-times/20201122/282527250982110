    <p>Is it pos­si­ble to en­sure a suc­cess­ful fam­ily stay­ca­tion, where kids and par­ents want the same things and there is no squab­bling over the re­mote?</p>
    <p>With­out the at­trac­tions of a for­eign lo­cale, stay­cays can feel too close to home, with fa­mil­iar pat­terns of do­mes­tic strain sim­mer­ing be­neath the sur­face.</p>
    <p>The good news is that plan­ning ahead and be­ing flex­i­ble is half the bat­tle won.</p>
    <p>Ms Skye Tan, a fam­ily life spe­cial­ist at the Fo­cus on the Fam­ily Sin­ga­pore char­ity, sug­gests plan­ning for time spent both in­doors and out, as well as scout­ing restau­rants, at­trac­tions and even sales nearby.</p>
    <p>Ba­bies and tod­dlers may need to stick to their day­time nap rou­tine for greater peace all around, while par­ents can bring snacks, en­ter­tain­ment and bub­ble bath gels to keep fid­gety young­sters oc­cu­pied, at least for a while.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan adds: “In­volve older kids in the plan­ning to in­crease their en­gage­ment, so there is joint own­er­ship in creat­ing a bond­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>But new thrills and day-to-night dis­trac­tions are not al­ways what chil­dren want.</p>
    <p>While so­cial me­dia can gen­er­ate Fomo (fear of miss­ing out) when com­par­ing hol­i­day plans with other fam­i­lies, a fully packed stay­ca­tion is un­nec­es­sary, says Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>“Con­sider in­clud­ing some down­time. What our chil­dren want most is our un­di­vided at­ten­tion. Spend­ing dis­trac­tion-free time with your child is a good way to learn more about him or her.”</p>
    <p>Re­peat vis­its to a vacation spot can be at­trac­tive for kids.</p>
    <p>A Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) spokesman says: “We have been see­ing a large num­ber of re­turn vis­its since we re­opened in July.”</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing de­mand for stay­ca­tions at RWS as “very strong” for this month and the next, the spokesman adds that many fam­i­lies with year-end school hol­i­day book­ings, some of whom are re­peat vis­i­tors, make sure they visit its Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore and S.E.A. Aquar­ium.</p>
    <p>Three Sun­day Times writers find out what makes a mem­o­rable fam­ily stay­ca­tion as they visit Ocean Suites at RWS, One Far­rer Ho­tel in Lit­tle In­dia and Oak­wood Premier AMTD Sin­ga­pore in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District.</p>
    <p>They talk about watch­ing stingrays swim up close, sur­vey­ing the city from a high-rise hot tub and, for one Gen X par­ent, par­ty­ing like it is 1999.</p>
