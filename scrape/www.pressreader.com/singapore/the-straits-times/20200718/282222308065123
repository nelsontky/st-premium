    <p>The phrase “warmed the cock­les of my heart” has been the sub­ject of much amuse­ment and in­trigue since MP Ja­mus Lim used it to thank Sengkang GRC vot­ers af­ter they elected his Work­ers’ Party team into Par­lia­ment in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Used to con­vey a sense of con­tent­ment and de­light, it is ac­tu­ally a ref­er­ence to the heart’s ven­tri­cles, or Cochleae cordis, and not real-life, sun-lov­ing cock­les that can be found on Sin­ga­pore’s shores.</p>
    <p>Among the cock­les species here, four are known to make their own food, said marine bi­ol­o­gist Neo Mei Lin, a re­search fel­low at the Trop­i­cal Marine Science In­sti­tute at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pho­to­syn­thetic al­gae liv­ing in their flesh har­ness sun­light stream­ing through the wa­ter to make food in a process known as pho­to­syn­the­sis.</p>
    <p>SUN-LOV­ING COCK­LES</p>
    <p>There is a heart cockle ( Cor­cu­lum cardissa), but it has noth­ing to do with the phrase. It earned its name be­cause of the shape of its shell.</p>
    <p>Marine en­thu­si­ast Loh Kok Sheng on Mon­day posted a se­ries of pho­to­graphs on Face­book show­ing the heart cockle.</p>
    <p>He said in the post that the phrase re­minded him of heart cock­les that can be found in Sin­ga­pore’s wa­ters. “Cock­les can be pretty... and heart­warm­ing too,” he said.</p>
    <p>The other three are the straw­berry cockle ( Fragum unedo), and its two cousins – the fluted gi­ant clam ( Tri­dacna squamosa) and the bor­ing gi­ant clam ( Tri­dacna cro­cea).</p>
    <p>Dr Neo, who stud­ies gi­ant clams, said: “Not many peo­ple may know that gi­ant clams are ac­tu­ally over­grown cock­les.”</p>
    <p>Cock­les and gi­ant clams are part of a broader group of or­gan­isms col­lec­tively known as bi­valves – which are or­gan­isms with two shells that are joined by a hinge.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, all bi­valves are fil­ter­feed­ers, said Dr Neo. That means they use gills to cap­ture food float­ing in the wa­ter col­umn.</p>
    <p>But some bi­valves have the added ca­pa­bil­ity of sup­ple­ment­ing their diet with nu­tri­tion pro­duced by the pho­to­syn­thetic al­gae in their folds.</p>
    <p>For gi­ant clams, the com­bi­na­tion of pho­to­sym­bio­sis and fil­ter feed­ing could be what al­lows them to reach great sizes up to 1.2m long.</p>
    <p>Even the small­est gi­ant clam is still rel­a­tively large, at 15cm long, said Dr Neo.</p>
    <p>As for the smaller heart cockle and rel­a­tives – which are usu­ally just a few cen­time­tres long – the rea­son for pho­to­sym­bio­sis is not well un­der­stood yet, said Dr Neo.</p>
    <p>Seafood sell­ers also use the term cockle to re­fer to a num­ber of small, ed­i­ble bi­valves, in­clud­ing the see hum, al­though these tend to be non-sym­bi­otic species.</p>
    <p>So why can some pho­to­sym­bi­otic cock­les, such as the gi­ant clam, grow to such large sizes, while oth­ers re­main small?</p>
    <p>Dr Neo said this is an area for fur­ther study. It could, for ex­am­ple, boil down to each species’ physique – some could be bet­ter adapted than oth­ers to max­imise light cap­ture.</p>
    <p>Gi­ant clams, for one, have greatly en­larged man­tles – the part of the or­gan­ism where the al­gae re­side, com­pared with their smaller cousins.</p>
    <p>This fea­ture helps to in­crease sur­face area for light cap­ture.</p>
    <p>More­over, gi­ant clams are of­ten found sit­ting on the seabed with their valves open. This ex­poses the man­tle to more light, fur­ther help­ing the or­gan­ism soak up the sun’s rays.</p>
    <p>A UNIQUE ADAP­TA­TION</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, the abil­ity of some bi­valves to host pho­to­syn­thetic al­gae is unique, be­cause most other or­gan­isms that do so have ex­posed soft tis­sue and large sur­face ar­eas that as­sist in light cap­ture. These in­clude reef-build­ing hard co­ral, as well as some shell-less sea slugs.</p>
    <p>“Yet, these hard-shelled bi­valves are able to fa­cil­i­tate pho­to­sym­bio­sis, even though their bod­ies are not ‘adapted’ for the process,” said Dr Neo.</p>
    <p>Heart cock­les have flat­tened translu­cent shells that in­crease the sur­face area for light cap­ture. And even though they have slightly pig­mented shells, which may pre­vent max­i­mum light cap­ture, they have other unique adap­ta­tions: win­dow­like struc­tures that are translu­cent.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Loh: “Most in­ter­est­ingly, heart cock­les have well-de­vel­oped translu­cent ‘win­dows’ and con­dens­ing-lens mi­crostruc­tures which al­low for light pen­e­tra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Neo said these tiny holes help to con­cen­trate light so they can pen­e­trate the shell to reach the tis­sue con­tain­ing the pho­to­syn­thetic al­gae.</p>
    <p>“Cou­pled with the fact that these cock­les have a thin shell and flat­tened body, these col­lec­tively en­hance the light cap­ture process.”</p>
    <p>Bi­valves such as cock­les and gi­ant clams may not be as charis­matic as some of Sin­ga­pore’s na­tive marine crea­tures, such as sea tur­tles or dol­phins. Yet, they play crit­i­cal roles in the marine ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, they are a food source for other species, in­clud­ing crabs and even seabirds.</p>
    <p>And as fil­ter feed­ers, they can help cleanse the wa­ter col­umn, by fil­ter­ing out nu­tri­ents and other larger par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Loh: “Bi­valves can also pro­vide in­di­rect ben­e­fits by sta­bil­is­ing shore­lines and mit­i­gat­ing nu­tri­ent pol­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, these cock­les can be found only on the seashores around the south­ern parts of the main­land, or along the Repub­lic’s off­shore South­ern Is­lands, said Dr Neo.</p>
    <p>Cock­les and gi­ant clams are part of a broader group of or­gan­isms col­lec­tively known as bi­valves – which are or­gan­isms with two shells that are joined by a hinge.</p>
