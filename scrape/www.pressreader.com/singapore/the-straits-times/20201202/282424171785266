    <p>BUENOS AIRES The doc­tor of Diego Maradona on Mon­day sought out the prose­cu­tors who are in­ves­ti­gat­ing his treat­ment of the Ar­gen­tinian foot­ball su­per­star be­fore he died last week, but was turned away be­cause he has not been charged with a crime.</p>
    <p>The probe into the icon’s death prompted prose­cu­tors to search the home and of­fice of Leopoldo Luque on Sun­day. They took med­i­cal files but did not charge him or say what prompted the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Luque has since gone on a me­dia of­fen­sive. He has done ex­ten­sive press in­ter­views and let the me­dia know he would ap­pear at the district at­tor­ney’s of­fice, which is con­duct­ing the probe, in the Buenos Aires sub­urb of San Isidro.</p>
    <p>He turned up at the of­fice to give a state­ment but he was not al­lowed to do so “be­cause he is not for­mally charged”, his lawyer Mara Digiuni tweeted.</p>
    <p>It was the lat­est soap-op­er­atic turn since Maradona died in his sleep aged 60 last Wed­nes­day, plung­ing Argentina into three days of na­tional mourn­ing.</p>
    <p>Widely per­ceived as one of the game’s best play­ers, he had a ragsto-riches story that took him from a poor neigh­bour­hood on the out­skirts of Buenos Aires to global celebrity – a jour­ney that res­onated with many Ar­gen­tini­ans. He achieved semi-divine sta­tus at home af­ter lead­ing Argentina to vic­tory in the 1986 World Cup but strug­gled with ad­dic­tion for years.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands gath­ered in lines that were 20 blocks deep last Thurs­day to pay their last re­spects as his body lay in state at the pres­i­den­tial palace.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives said Maradona died of a heart at­tack at his home in Ti­gre, north of Buenos Aires. The star had been plagued with med­i­cal prob­lems and un­der­went brain surgery for a sub­du­ral haematoma last month.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of Maradona’s fam­ily have said his death was avoidable. An am­bu­lance took more than half an hour to ar­rive, claimed Ma­tias Morla, a lawyer for Maradona, call­ing it “crim­i­nal id­iocy” and adding that he would re­quest an in­ves­ti­ga­tion. But prose­cu­tors have dis­puted that time­line and said the am­bu­lance ar­rived in 12 min­utes.</p>
    <p>An­other for­mer doc­tor for</p>
    <p>Maradona, Al­fredo Cahe, called his death “un­usual”, adding that a doc­tor should have been sta­tioned in his room and that Maradona should have stayed in the hos­pi­tal af­ter his op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Luque dis­putes that al­le­ga­tion, claim­ing no one could force the for­mer star to do so against his will.</p>
    <p>Talk­ing to re­porters on Sun­day af­ter­noon, he said he had he co­op­er­ated with law en­force­ment and was ready to an­swer any ques­tions. The neu­ro­sur­geon painted a pic­ture of a su­per­star who was “very dif­fi­cult” and had to be con­vinced to take care of his health.</p>
    <p>Maradona “kicked me out of his house many times”, he added.</p>
    <p>“Diego was tired, tired of be­ing ‘Maradona’,” he said.</p>
