    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance schemes ad­min­is­tered by the Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC) can now be made through a new por­tal for greater con­ve­nience.</p>
    <p>The AIC launched the eSer­vices for Fi­nanc­ing Schemes (eFass) on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>“This is to bring greater con­ve­nience to those who are ap­ply­ing or ben­e­fit­ing from the schemes,” said an AIC spokesman.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this por­tal was rolled out, hard copies of the ap­pli­ca­tion forms had to be sub­mit­ted to the AIC.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants also had to wait for the AIC to no­tify them by mail, call or e-mail to check if their ap­pli­ca­tion is suc­cess­ful or how much has been dis­bursed.</p>
    <p>Us­ing their SingPass, users can now ac­cess the new por­tal at https://efi­nance.aic.sg to ap­ply for a fi­nan­cial aid scheme and track the sta­tus of their ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>They can also change their de­tails, such as their bank ac­count num­ber or con­tact num­ber, and check their lat­est state­ments, among other things.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial aid schemes run by the AIC in­clude the CareShield Life, El­der Fund and the For­eign Do­mes­tic Worker Levy Con­ces­sion for Per­sons with Dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Karen Wong, 52, an ad­min­is­tra­tive staff, re­cently ap­plied for the Home Care­giv­ing Grant, the In­terim Dis­abil­ity As­sis­tance Pro­gramme for the El­derly and the Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion Dis­abil­ity As­sis­tance Scheme for her mother.</p>
    <p>Her 91-year-old mother suf­fers from mild de­men­tia and uses a wheel­chair as she is very frail. She also has di­a­betes, among other chronic con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said of the new por­tal: “I find the por­tal very use­ful as it is more con­ve­nient and cuts down on a lot of pa­per­work for the care­givers. We can ac­cess it any­time to check on the in­for­ma­tion we re­quire.”</p>
    <p>She added that the fi­nan­cial aid, such as the $100 a month from the Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion Dis­abil­ity As­sis­tance Scheme and the $200 a month from the Home Care­giv­ing Grant, is very much ap­pre­ci­ated and needed to de­fray the cost of hir­ing a maid, and other ex­penses, to care for her mum.</p>
