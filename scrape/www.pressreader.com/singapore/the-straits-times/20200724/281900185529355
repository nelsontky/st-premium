    <p>WASH­ING­TON • “Per­son. Woman. Man. Cam­era. TV.” United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump again sought to show­case his men­tal fit­ness on tele­vi­sion by recit­ing, over and over in an in­ter­view broad­cast on Wed­nes­day, what he said was a sam­ple cog­ni­tive test­ing se­quence.</p>
    <p>For the bet­ter part of a month, Mr Trump, 74, has made re­peated ap­pear­ances on Fox News to brag about ac­ing a cog­ni­tive test he said he re­cently took at Wal­ter Reed Na­tional Mil­i­tary Med­i­cal Cen­tre, first with talk-show host Sean Han­nity and again with news an­chor Chris Wal­lace on Fox News Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The White House has not dis­closed de­tails about when the Pres­i­dent un­der­went the test­ing or why.</p>
    <p>In the most re­cent in­ter­view – a six-minute seg­ment with Dr Marc Siegel, a pro­fes­sor of medicine at New York Univer­sity and a med­i­cal an­a­lyst for Fox News – Mr Trump tried to de­fend his own men­tal fit­ness for of­fice by out­lin­ing the par­tic­u­lars of the test he said he had taken and by ques­tion­ing the acu­ity of for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, 77, the pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally some­thing that’s been great,” Mr Trump said, re­fer­ring to be­ing the pres­i­dent. “But you need stamina. You need phys­i­cal health, and you need men­tal health.”</p>
    <p>Then Mr Trump seemed to of­fer dif­fer­ing time­lines for when he had taken the test.</p>
    <p>First, he said he had asked a physi­cian “a lit­tle less than a year ago” if there was a test he could take to prove his men­tal acu­ity to the me­dia. It is un­clear when that visit oc­curred: Last month, the White House re­leased a sum­mary of Mr Trump’s health but not an an­nual phys­i­cal re­port, and did not ex­plain an unusual, unan­nounced visit last au­tumn to Wal­ter Reed.</p>
    <p>Then, Mr Trump said that he had asked Dr Ronny Jack­son, who has not been his physi­cian since 2018, if there was an acu­ity test he could take.</p>
    <p>That year – af­ter the book Fire And Fury de­scribed some of Mr Trump’s ad­vis­ers ques­tion­ing his fit­ness for of­fice – Dr Jack­son said that the Pres­i­dent had re­ceived a score of 30 out of 30 on the Mon­treal Cog­ni­tive As­sess­ment (Moca).</p>
    <p>The Moca test has been crit­i­cised by ex­perts as too blunt an in­stru­ment that does not rule out de­clines in rea­son­ing or mem­ory, or dif­fi­cul­ties with plan­ning or judg­ment.</p>
    <p>“It was 30 to 35 ques­tions,” Mr Trump re­called on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“The first ques­tions are very easy. The last ques­tions are much more dif­fi­cult. Like a mem­ory ques­tion. It’s, like, you’ll go: Per­son. Woman. Man. Cam­era. TV. So they say, ‘Could you re­peat that?’ So I said, ‘Yeah. It’s: Per­son. Woman. Man. Cam­era. TV,’” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>“Then, 10 min­utes, 15, 20 min­utes later they say, ‘Re­mem­ber that first ques­tion – not the first – but the 10th ques­tion? Give us that again. Can you do that again?’ And you go: ‘Per­son. Woman. Man. Cam­era. TV.’ If you get it in or­der, you get ex­tra points.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It’s ac­tu­ally not that easy, but for me, it was easy... They say, ‘That’s amaz­ing. How did you do that?’</p>
    <p>“I do it be­cause I have, like, a good mem­ory, be­cause I’m cog­ni­tively there. Now, Joe should take that test, be­cause some­thing’s go­ing on.”</p>
    <p>Prof Siegel did not ask fol­low-up ques­tions.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view broad­cast on Sun­day, when told that Mr Bi­den was cho­sen in a Fox poll as the more men­tally sound can­di­date, Mr Trump dis­puted that find­ing and de­fended his cog­ni­tive test re­sults to Mr Wal­lace, who said he had taken the same test that the Pres­i­dent had boasted about ac­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Wal­lace said one ques­tion had asked to iden­tify an ele­phant.</p>
    <p>“It’s all mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion,” Mr Trump said. “Be­cause, yes, the first few ques­tions are easy, but I’ll bet you couldn’t even an­swer the last five ques­tions. I’ll bet you couldn’t. They get very hard, the last five ques­tions.”</p>
