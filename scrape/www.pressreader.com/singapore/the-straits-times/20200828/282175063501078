    <p>Two teenagers linked to a drink sam­pling in­ci­dent at a su­per­mar­ket amid the Covid-19 out­break were each sen­tenced to pro­ba­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Nigel Pang Yew Ming, 18, and his 17-year-old friend had each pleaded guilty on July 16 to one count of be­ing a pub­lic nui­sance.</p>
    <p>Both teens were sen­tenced to nine months’ pro­ba­tion and their par­ents were bonded for $5,000 to en­sure their good be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>The pair must per­form 60 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice each and also re­main in­doors from 10pm to 6am every day.</p>
    <p>The younger of­fender can no longer be named in news re­ports due to re­cent amend­ments to the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act, which now cov­ers teenagers be­low 18 years old.</p>
    <p>The two Sin­ga­pore­ans went to a FairPrice out­let in Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 7 at around 6.45pm on Feb 6, and Pang took two bot­tles of fruit juice from a re­frig­er­ated shelf.</p>
    <p>He sam­pled both drinks be­fore putting them back on the shelf.</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old boy recorded his friend’s an­tics and the video was posted on In­sta­gram, via an In­stas­tory, with the cap­tion “How to spread Wuhan virus”.</p>
    <p>Wuhan is the Chi­nese city that was the epi­cen­tre of the Covid-19 out­break at the time.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier state­ment, the po­lice said an ac­quain­tance recorded a copy of the video and cir­cu­lated it on­line.</p>
    <p>They added that this caused pub­lic alarm and con­cern.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Ti­motheus Koh said last month that Pang later paid for the two bot­tles of juice.</p>
    <p>Pang also knew that the friend would cap­tion the video “How to spread Wuhan virus” and post it on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Pang told him to high­light that he had paid for the bot­tles of fruit juice. The friend posted this in­for­ma­tion in a sub­se­quent In­stas­tory in­stead.</p>
    <p>The DPP had also told the court then that the video gained trac­tion on so­cial me­dia, with many mem­bers of the pub­lic ex­press­ing an­noy­ance at the teenagers’ an­tics.</p>
    <p>A 21-year-old woman who came across the clip alerted the po­lice on Feb 8.</p>
    <p>For be­ing a pub­lic nui­sance, an of­fender can be jailed for up to three months and fined up to $2,000.</p>
