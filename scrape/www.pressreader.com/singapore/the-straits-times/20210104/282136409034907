    <p>Deep in con­cen­tra­tion, the Tang fam­ily picks up saga seeds scat­tered on a slop­ing grass patch next to Block 341 Hougang Av­enue 7.</p>
    <p>Led by Ms Yvonne Tang, the five fam­ily mem­bers span­ning three gen­er­a­tions, along with a fam­ily friend, split them­selves, aged be­tween eight and 68, into two teams to pick up the seeds last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Her nine-year-old nephew</p>
    <p>Tidus, said he en­joyed the chal­lenge of rac­ing to pick up the most seeds, while his sis­ter Es­tee, eight, sim­ply found the bright red seeds pretty.</p>
    <p>The group col­lected more than 200 seeds and plan to use them for art and crafts or as dec­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, they have filled a re­cy­cled plas­tic con­tainer with saga seeds as dec­o­ra­tion and turned it into a mask holder.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old project man­ager said she ini­ti­ated this sagaseed col­lect­ing ac­tiv­ity on the first day of phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s reopening as they were able to gather in a larger group.</p>
    <p>“As ev­ery­body would crowd the malls due to phase three, this ac­tiv­ity is some­thing away from the crowds where we can gather as a fam­ily and do things to­gether in a healthy way,” she said.</p>
    <p>Saga seeds come from t he Adenan­thera pavon­ina tree, also known as the saga tree. Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Parks Board, the saga tree grows up to 20m in height and drops fruit pods car­ry­ing seeds ev­ery six to eight months.</p>
    <p>The ined­i­ble seeds have a uni­form weight (four seeds make up 1g), which made them an ideal tool to help mea­sure sil­ver and gold in an­cient In­dia.</p>
    <p>Ms Tang be­gan col­lect­ing saga seeds more than three decades ago when her fam­ily friend Pek Lay Pheng, 50, asked for her help to col­lect the seeds for a se­condary school project.</p>
    <p>Ms Tang’s mother Heng Sai Keng, 68, had also col­lected the seeds as a child. “It is an easy form of ex­er­cise for the kids and my mother, though it can be quite stren­u­ous be­cause you have to bend over and squint your eyes as well,” said Ms Tang, who rekin­dled her love for col­lect­ing the seeds when she moved to her flat in Hougang five years ago.</p>
    <p>“So af­ter 15 min­utes, you will feel a light kind of strain that shows you have ex­er­cised. And be­cause there’s a slight slope, it trains up our leg mus­cles.</p>
    <p>“It’s es­pe­cially fun when the whole fam­ily gets to­gether and we form this healthy com­pe­ti­tion to race and mo­ti­vate one an­other.”</p>
