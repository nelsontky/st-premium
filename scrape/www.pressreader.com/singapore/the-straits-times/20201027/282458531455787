    <p>Sex, vi­o­lence and LGBT (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der) re­la­tion­ships have long been taboo for Viet­nam’s film cen­sors, but they are now find­ing their way into the open as a new wave of di­rec­tors pushes the bound­aries set by the na­tion’s con­ser­va­tive com­mu­nist lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The l at­est movie to test the wa­ters is Chi Chi Em Em – or Sis­ter Sis­ter – which was fea­tured at Asia’s big­gest film fes­ti­val last week af­ter a strong per­for­mance at the Viet­namese box of­fice.</p>
    <p>A psy­cho­log­i­cal thriller about love, de­ceit and re­venge, the film fea­tures sex scenes be­tween women and a com­plex nar­ra­tive fo­cused on adul­tery and trauma – the type of movie that film-mak­ers might have strug­gled to make just five years ago.</p>
    <p>“When I told them about the script, a lot of peo­ple said, ‘ you should just save your time, it’s go­ing to get cut’,” says Viet­namese</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can direc­tor Kathy Uyen.</p>
    <p>“But I want to tell dar­ing sto­ries about mod­ern women who are strong and quirky, and full of pas­sion,” the 39-year-old adds in an in­ter­view with Agence FrancePres­se ahead of the movie’s screen­ing at the Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment guide­lines, Viet­namese films must demon­strate “good ide­o­log­i­cal con­tent” to pass the cen­sor­ship board.</p>
    <p>Pornog­ra­phy, vi­o­lence and hos­til­ity to­wards the state are not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>But the board is of­ten ac­cused of cen­sor­ship be­yond its re­mit.</p>
    <p>Last year, film-maker Phan Dang Di told state me­dia the ap­proval process was akin to “tor­ture”, while oth­ers have ad­mit­ted they self-cen­sor to avoid an ex­haust­ing back-and-forth.</p>
    <p>Fear of fall­ing foul of the cen­sors – and a con­vic­tion that cin­ema­go­ers pre­fer easy-to-watch rom­coms – meant di­rec­tors rarely dared to ex­per­i­ment in the past, says film critic Le Hong Lam.</p>
    <p>But he be­lieves the scene is chang­ing thanks to a new gen­er­a­tion of film-mak­ers who are pulling au­di­ences along with them.</p>
    <p>“Over the past five years – and es­pe­cially dur­ing the last two – there has been a shift in top­ics of Viet­namese films,” he says, re­fer­ring to Le Van Kiet’s Hai Phuong, or Furie, which tells the story of a for­mer gang­ster thrust back into her past when traf­fick­ers kid­nap her daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“These show that Viet­namese au­di­ences are open to new top­ics – they’re not just com­ing to cin­e­mas for fun. They want films that make them think,” he says.</p>
    <p>Rom, a gritty tale of Ho Chi Minh City street kids work­ing in the il­le­gal lottery busi­ness to sur­vive, was an­other game-changer, said Lam.</p>
    <p>De­spite bag­ging a top prize at Bu­san last year, the film was fined for screen­ing with­out ap­proval and took months to clear cen­sor­ship hur­dles, spark­ing con­tro­versy in the press and on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“I think that af­ter this... the cen­sor­ship board in Viet­nam started to make changes to catch up with mod­ern tastes, not cut­ting things on a whim like be­fore,” says Lam.</p>
    <p>Rom direc­tor Tran Thanh Huy is con­vinced the winds of change are blow­ing through Viet­namese cinema, but says it will take more than one film to shift the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>“It needs a lot of voices and a lot of films to cre­ate a real change,” the 30-year-old says.</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to make in­no­va­tive films with un­con­ven­tional nar­ra­tives, he screened a ver­sion of Rom at the Bu­san fes­ti­val with an end­ing “open to in­ter­pre­ta­tion”, but was forced into a dif­fer­ent, hap­pier con­clu­sion by cen­sors.</p>
    <p>Still, the film took in US$2 mil­lion (S$2.7 mil­lion) over its first week in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Film­goer Tran Hien Vy, a 21-yearold from Ho Chi Minh, says the new ap­proach by di­rec­tors and cen­sors should win over young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The con­ser­va­tive film style can­not make us spend our money and time to go to cin­e­mas,” she says.</p>
    <p>Chi Chi Em Em is an­other ex­am­ple of progress, ac­cord­ing to direc­tor Uyen.</p>
    <p>“The thing I feel re­ally happy about is that when we sent it to the film cen­sor board, they only asked me to re­duce this one love scene by about 30 per cent and take out two or three cuss words, and that was it,” she says.</p>
    <p>Her film de­picts events “that hap­pen ev­ery day in our lives”, she adds. “I don’t think I por­trayed any­thing shock­ing, but in Viet­nam this is new.”</p>
