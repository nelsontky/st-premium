    <p>New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern (ranked No. 32) and Tai­wan Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen (right, ranked No. 37) were the female lead­ers who made it to this year’s Forbes list of the world’s 100 most pow­er­ful women, which paid par­tic­u­lar at­ten­tion to women’s roles in bat­tling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Women lead­ers who have stood out for their han­dling of the Covid-19 out­break earned honours on the an­nual Forbes list of the world’s 100 most pow­er­ful women, which high­lighted women’s roles i n bat­tling the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Women from prime min­is­ters to cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives earned spots in the list for their achieve­ments in help­ing to mit­i­gate and con­trol the virus, which has in­fected more than 67 mil­lion peo­ple and caused 1.54 mil­lion deaths, Forbes said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern (ranked No. 32), Tai­wan Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen (No. 37), Fin­nish Prime Min­is­ter Sanna Marin (No. 85), Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank pres­i­dent Chris­tine La­garde (No. 2) and Tokyo Gover­nor Yuriko Koike (No. 63) were par­tic­u­larly ef­fec­tive, it said.</p>
    <p>“Where they dif­fer in age, na­tion­al­ity and job de­scrip­tion, they are united in the ways they have been us­ing their plat­forms to ad­dress the unique chal­lenges of 2020,” Forbes said on its web­site.</p>
    <p>It quoted Nor­we­gian Prime Min­is­ter Erna Sol­berg, ranked 52nd on the list, as say­ing re­cently that “coun­tries where hu­man rights are re­spected and where women are able to reach top po­si­tions in so­ci­ety are also the coun­tries that are the best equipped to han­dle crises by Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>New Zealand elim­i­nated Covid-19 in­fec­tions with a strict lock­down, re­port­ing j ust over 2,000 cases of the coro­n­avirus and 25 deaths.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan kept the pan­demic un­der con­trol af­ter in­sti­tut­ing strict re­stric­tions and largely clos­ing its bor­ders in Jan­uary – long be­fore Western coun­tries – lim­it­ing cases to just over 700 and seven deaths, it said.</p>
    <p>Of the 17 new­com­ers to the Forbes list, Ms Carol Tome (No. 11), chief ex­ec­u­tive of United Par­cel Ser­vice, where de­liv­ery vol­umes sky­rock­eted dur­ing lock­downs, and Ms Linda Ren­dle (No. 87), chief ex­ec­u­tive of Clorox, which boosted pro­duc­tion of clean­ing goods, were noted for their work.</p>
    <p>At CVS Health, Ms Karen Lynch (No. 38), who will be­come chief ex­ec­u­tive in Fe­bru­ary, took over the phar­macy gi­ant’s Covid-19 re­sponse and ex­ten­sive net­work of test­ing sites. Next year, she will over­see vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion at the com­pany’s nearly 10,000 United States lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Stacey Cun­ning­ham (No. 35), the first woman to head the New York Stock Ex­change, made the “swift” de­ci­sion to shut down in-per­son trad­ing as the virus was spread­ing in March.</p>
    <p>For the 10th con­sec­u­tive year, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel headed the group of 100 women that also in­cluded lead­ers in en­ter­tain­ment, tech­nol­ogy, phi­lan­thropy and fi­nance from 30 coun­tries. Other hon­ourees in­cluded US Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris (No. 3) and Bri­tain’s Queen El­iz­a­beth II (No. 46).</p>
