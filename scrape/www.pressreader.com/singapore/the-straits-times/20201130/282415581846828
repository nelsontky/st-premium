    <p>An­thony Smith snapped a two-fight skid in dom­i­nant fash­ion, sub­mit­ting Devon Clark in­side the first round of the main event at the Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) Vegas 15 event on Satur­day night in Las Vegas, Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>The light-heavy­weight clash was up­graded to the main event af­ter a heavy­weight bout be­tween Cur­tis Blay­des and for­mer ti­tle chal­lenger Der­rick Lewis was can­celled on the eve of the event af­ter Blay­des tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For­mer light-heavy­weight ti­tle con­tender Smith made full use of the spotlight and made short work of Clark, forc­ing his op­po­nent to tap out af­ter a tri­an­gle choke mid­way through the first round.</p>
    <p>Smith, nick­named “Lion­heart”, has en­dured a che­quered record since fail­ing to beat then-cham­pion Jon Jones at the UFC 235 event in March last year.</p>
    <p>He bounced back three months later with an im­pres­sive sub­mis­sion win over Swede Alexan­der Gustafs­son but then slipped to two de­feats this year, against Brazil­ian Glover Teix­eira and Aus­trian Alek­san­dar Ra­kic.</p>
    <p>“It means the world to me... I just wanted to end the year with a W,” said Smith. “I want to keep get­ting bet­ter and go on a run. I don’t want to rush it. I’m not call­ing any­body out. I’m just go­ing to take it one fight at a time. Let’s just get to 2021 and bring bet­ter things... I’ve said it for years, I’m go­ing to be a world cham­pion.”</p>
    <p>Since it started hold­ing events in May, the UFC has had to can­cel or post­pone sev­eral ma­jor fights be­cause of fight­ers test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The light-heavy­weight bout be­tween Teix­eira and his com­pa­triot Thi­ago San­tos was post­poned twice, from Sept 12 to Oct 4 to Nov 7, af­ter Teix­eira, and then San­tos, tested pos­i­tive. Teix­eira won via sub­mis­sion when the pair fi­nally met at UFC Vegas 13.</p>
    <p>For­mer light­weight cham­pion Rafael dos An­jos also tested pos­i­tive in Oc­to­ber, caus­ing his UFC 254 bout with Rus­sian Is­lam Makhachev to be post­poned from Oct 24 to Nov 14. Makhachev was later re­placed due to in­jury by Paul Felder, with dos An­jos win­ning a split de­ci­sion at UFC Vegas 14.</p>
    <p>Next Satur­day’s UFC Vegas 16 event will also have a new main event af­ter Kevin Hol­land tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, forc­ing the Amer­i­can out of his sched­uled fight against Swede Jack Her­mans­son. Ac­cord­ing to MMA Fight­ing, Ital­ian Marvin Vet­tori will re­place Hol­land.</p>
