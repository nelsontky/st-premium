    <p>Sixty-three-year-old Christo­pher Cheng has de­voted his life to pre­vent­ing and cur­ing can­cers, par­tic­u­larly prostate can­cer. He has done nu­mer­ous prostate can­cer op­er­a­tions since 1991 and pi­o­neered ro­bots in surgery in Asia, which has helped to speed up re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>As a se­nior con­sul­tant urol­o­gist, Pro­fes­sor Cheng thought he knew many things. “I thought I knew about prostate can­cer, I thought I knew about pa­tients with prostate can­cer and I thought I knew about pa­tients with can­cers. I even thought I knew my pa­tients as they went through the ups and downs, the ela­tion and the dis­ap­point­ment, and the suf­fer­ings.”</p>
    <p>But his be­liefs were shaken in Novem­ber 2017 when the roles were re­versed and he was found to have the very same con­di­tion he was an ex­pert in – prostate can­cer. Not even his 37 years in the field could pre­pare him for the news that he had turned into a pa­tient.</p>
    <p>“It’s an irony that de­spite all the years I have de­voted to this area, lit­tle did I know what my pa­tients re­ally go through un­til I be­came a pa­tient,” said Prof Cheng, who was head of urol­ogy at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) from 2001 to 2011 and had per­formed prostate can­cer surgery on many pa­tients, in­clud­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>He has now come out with an ac­count of his ex­pe­ri­ence as pro­fes­sor-turned-pa­tient in a book, I Thought I Knew.</p>
    <p>Prof Cheng, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, is also an ad­junct pro­fes­sor at Duke-NUS Grad­u­ate Med­i­cal School and clin­i­cal as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He has writ­ten more than 100 pub­li­ca­tions i n l ocal and i nter­na­tional peer-re­viewed jour­nals in ar­eas in­clud­ing prostate can­cer.</p>
    <p>Prof Cheng said he had back pain and suf­fered urine re­ten­tion and a uri­nary tract in­fec­tion over the years. In the pre­ced­ing five years be­fore his can­cer was di­ag­nosed, he had also found him­self wak­ing up to go to the bath­room. He at­trib­uted this to prostate en­large­ment and self-med­i­cated to man­age the in­con­ve­nience of poor uri­nary flow and in­creas­ing ur­gency to get to the bath­room.</p>
    <p>When his con­di­tion wors­ened, he dis­cussed with his col­leagues about go­ing for a sur­gi­cal op­er­a­tion, known as transureth­ral re­sec­tion of the prostate, to re­lieve the ob­struc­tion. How­ever, dur­ing the pre­op­er­a­tion eval­u­a­tion, it was dis­cov­ered that he had mod­er­ately high­grade prostate can­cer.</p>
    <p>“It is a huge blow for any­body who un­ex­pect­edly comes across what would maybe be a life-chang­ing episode. I had some re­gret. There were missed op­por­tu­ni­ties (to fol­low up on symp­toms),” he said.</p>
    <p>He had can­cer surgery the fol­low­ing month, in De­cem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>In hind­sight, he thought: “Would I have seen a doc­tor much ear­lier about my uri­nary prob­lems if I were not a urol­o­gist? Would I have un­der­gone eval­u­a­tion and surgery much ear­lier if I had not been so busy, first as head of urol­ogy, then as CEO of a new hos­pi­tal?”</p>
    <p>But he knew to a cer­tain ex­tent he was in de­nial. “I see pa­tients post­pon­ing nec­es­sary eval­u­a­tions and I see many col­leagues busy with work and never find­ing the time to con­sult. We blame our pa­tients for be­ing non-com­pli­ant. Maybe we are all the same. I should have fol­lowed my own ad­vice,” said Prof Cheng, who is mar­ried to as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Brenda Ang, a se­nior con­sul­tant at the depart­ment of in­fec­tious diseases at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal and the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases.</p>
    <p>Af­ter dis­cus­sions with his team, he de­cided to ask his friend, Dr Mi­hir De­sai, an in­ter­na­tion­ally renowned urol­o­gist, to fly in from Los An­ge­les to con­duct the can­cer surgery at SGH.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Cheng: “We ad­vise our sur­geons and med­i­cal stu­dents not to op­er­ate on or be the pri­mary physi­cian for their fam­ily mem­bers. In the urol­ogy cen­tre, I trained most of them and we see one an­other more than we see our fam­ily. I didn’t want to men­tally over­bur­den the team with the out­come of the surgery. I wanted to be treated like a reg­u­lar pa­tient.”</p>
    <p>When he woke up af­ter the surgery – a ro­bot-as­sisted key­hole prosta­te­c­tomy – he re­called feel­ing very cold. He was un­der four blan­kets, but his legs were still shak­ing un­con­trol­lably. At that mo­ment he thought: “It was not sup­posed to be like this. Most of my own pa­tients go­ing through this op­er­a­tion are not this sick.”</p>
    <p>He also re­counted in his book that his friends had ex­pected him to leave the hos­pi­tal the next day, break a record and go back to work the fol­low­ing week.</p>
    <p>But Prof Cheng was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing an in­fec­tion from the surgery and had gone into sep­tic shock.</p>
    <p>Even as a pa­tient, he tried to take charge. He asked to see his regis­trar and sug­gested that he be moved to the in­ten­sive care unit if his con­di­tion wors­ened. But his con­di­tion started to im­prove with ad­di­tional med­i­ca­tion and the in­fec­tion sub­sided over the fol­low­ing few days.</p>
    <p>The next day, he apol­o­gised to the team for be­ing the pa­tient from hell. He wrote: “Look­ing af­ter your for­mer boss was dif­fi­cult enough un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances. It was dou­bly tough when your for­mer boss has a con­di­tion that he is sup­posed to be an ex­pert in and to un­dergo a pro­ce­dure which he pi­o­neered.”</p>
    <p>In his years as a doc­tor, he had come across pa­tients from hell and then he was one him­self.</p>
    <p>“Pa­tients need em­pa­thy and un­der­stand­ing and when they don’t get it, they keep on ask­ing the same ques­tion even though they’ve heard the an­swer three times. They feel their con­cerns have not been heard openly. It’s about con­nect­ing at the heart level, not on a su­per­fi­cial level,” added Prof Cheng, who re­alised this as a pa­tient. He is now in re­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Com­pas­sion and em­pa­thy are two themes which re­sound in al­most every chap­ter in his book.</p>
    <p>“In to­day’s con­text, tech­ni­cal ex­cel­lence is a given. It is ex­pected you will do the right med­i­cal test, in­ter­pret it cor­rectly and that the surgery will be done cor­rectly,” said Prof Cheng. What is miss­ing is this “al­most mys­ti­cal word – em­pa­thy”, he added.</p>
    <p>“We spend years teach­ing stu­dents em­pa­thy and the five stages of grief and we thought we were do­ing a good job. But, as one of my on­col­o­gist col­leagues said, we don’t know any­thing un­til ei­ther you or a close rel­a­tive is in the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing gone through the same ex­pe­ri­ence as his pa­tients, he said he will never again un­der­es­ti­mate the anx­i­ety of pa­tients wait­ing to see their biopsy re­sults.</p>
    <p>Be­fore, he would con­grat­u­late pa­tients whose re­sults in­di­cated a clean bill of health. Now, he tears up and some­times gives them a hug. “It’s re­cip­ro­cal ther­apy. It’s very in­tense,” he said.</p>
    <p>The in­spi­ra­tion for his book came on the third day af­ter his surgery.</p>
    <p>Prof Cheng, a tal­ented wa­ter­colourist who stud­ied un­der prom­i­nent Sin­ga­pore artist Ong Kim Seng, was sketch­ing by the win­dow in hos­pi­tal when his son Colin vis­ited him af­ter school.</p>
    <p>The younger Mr Cheng, 30, said: “I told my dad he must have seen this view thou­sands of times in the last 30 to 40 years when he vis­ited pa­tients on his rounds and now he was see­ing the same view through a pa­tient’s eye.”</p>
    <p>The PhD stu­dent in In­te­grated Bi­ol­ogy and Medicine at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School added: “I told him he should doc­u­ment this irony.”</p>
    <p>The paint­ing now ap­pears on the cover of the book.</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, Prof Cheng would some­times share his ex­pe­ri­ences with his pa­tients. “If I feel my ex­pe­ri­ence can ben­e­fit them in their de­ci­sion-mak­ing re­gard­ing their con­di­tion, I’ll show them my scar. They ap­pre­ci­ate the fact that their doc­tor is also a fel­low suf­ferer.”</p>
    <p>I even thought I knew my pa­tients as they went through the ups and downs, the ela­tion and the dis­ap­point­ment, and the suf­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>It’s an irony that de­spite all the years I have de­voted to this area, lit­tle did I know what my pa­tients re­ally go through un­til I be­came a pa­tient ’’</p>
