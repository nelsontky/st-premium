    <p>• Two-time world cham­pion Fer­nando Alonso has de­fended his in­clu­sion in a For­mula One “young driver” test at the age of 39, saying he needs laps un­der his belt be­fore his come­back next year.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion (FIA) has given the Spa­niard spe­cial dis­pen­sa­tion to par­tic­i­pate in the post-sea­son test in Abu Dhabi next Tues­day, up­set­ting some ri­val teams.</p>
    <p>But Alonso, who last raced for McLaren in 2018, in­sisted that he needs to iron out the kinks be­fore he re­turns to a Renault team who will be re­branded as Alpine next term.</p>
    <p>“I know there is a lot of talk about me. I am happy that ri­val teams are so wor­ried for a test that I am j ust get­ting up to speed,” he told Sky Sports at the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“They can be more re­laxed be­cause I will not de­velop any­thing, just some kilo­me­tres for me.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that for­mer F1 driv­ers Robert Ku­bica and Se­bastien Buemi would also be tak­ing part for Alfa Romeo and Red Bull re­spec­tively, yet there was “not much talk about those guys”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, nei­ther will be rac­ing in F1 next year, lead­ing McLaren’s Lando Nor­ris to point out that Alonso should not be al­lowed to take part in the test.</p>
    <p>“He’s dou­ble my age pretty much so that must make me ex­tremely young,” the 21-year-old Bri­ton, whose team are switch­ing from Renault to Mercedes en­gines for 2021 and will not be in­volved in the test­ing, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“It’s fairly ob­vi­ous Fer­nando’s not a young driver. It’s not like he’s only done one or two races... and he’s been do­ing count­less tests al­ready this year in For­mula One cars. So I don’t get it.</p>
    <p>“I don’t get why they’ve changed the rules just for him. I think it’s quite silly and it shouldn’t be al­lowed.”</p>
    <p>Renault team prin­ci­pal Cyril Abite­boul sar­cas­ti­cally told re­porters the test was for young driv­ers “plus any­one that the FIA will give per­mis­sion to”.</p>
