    <p>The au­thor­i­ties and health ex­perts are sound­ing the alarm again as coun­tries ex­pe­ri­ence an ex­plo­sive new surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Worse is ex­pected to come, with the on­set of win­ter in some ar­eas, cou­pled with ex­as­per­ated pop­u­la­tions suf­fer­ing from lock­down fa­tigue and many just hang­ing on to hope that a vi­able vac­cine is near.</p>
    <p>There is no deny­ing that Covid-19 is back with a vengeance in some parts of the world, and the au­thor­i­ties as well as health ex­perts fear worse may be yet to come.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause of the on­set of win­ter cou­pled with ex­as­per­ated pop­u­la­tions, with many peo­ple now just hang­ing on to hope that a vi­able vac­cine may be just round the cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, whose daily Covid-19 in­fec­tions num­bered in the low hun­dreds only weeks ago, has seen a marked uptick in cases over the past fort­night. It hit a new daily high for the sec­ond straight day yes­ter­day, with at least 1,693 cases.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in South Korea are also creep­ing up af­ter a brief lull that saw daily cases fall­ing be­low 100 in Septem­ber. For the past two weeks, the coun­try has been reg­is­ter­ing triple-digit new cases on most days.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­ported a record 5,444 new cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>And Malaysia has been re­port­ing new in­fec­tions in the high hun­dreds since mid-Oc­to­ber. The coun­try reg­is­tered about 800 to 900 in­fec­tions ev­ery day this week.</p>
    <p>Across Europe, the in­fec­tion curves are also show­ing a clear up­ward trend.</p>
    <p>Russia yes­ter­day reg­is­tered a record high of 21,983 new cases, as did Ger­many with its 23,542 cases.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain hit an­other all-time high of 33,470 daily in­fec­tions on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The same day, Greece for the first time recorded more than 3,000 new cases, and Italy has re­ported over 30,000 in­fec­tions al­most ev­ery day this month.</p>
    <p>In the United States, to­tal cases set a new high for the third straight day, with 153,496 in­fec­tions on Thurs­day. More than a dozen states have dou­bled their caseloads over the past two weeks. US cities, in­clud­ing New York, Chicago, Detroit and Cal­i­for­nia, have reim­posed pub­lic health re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>News this week that an ef­fec­tive vac­cine was an­other step closer to fruition has fed op­ti­mism among peo­ple around the world left fa­tigued by months of so­cial re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and BioNTech’s dis­clo­sure of suc­cess­ful early data from large-scale clin­i­cal tri­als of their Covid-19 vac­cine sent bea­t­en­down stock mar­kets soar­ing.</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cials and health ex­perts have warned against com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>With win­ter de­scend­ing on some re­gions, the pan­demic may yet</p>
    <p>DON’T PLAY WAIT­ING GAME</p>
    <p>We may be tired of Covid-19 but it is not tired of us... A vac­cine is needed ur­gently, but we can­not wait for a vac­cine and put all our eggs in one bas­ket.</p>
    <p>WORLD HEALTH OR­GAN­I­SA­TION CHIEF TE­DROS AD­HANOM GHE­BREYE­SUS</p>
    <p>HEALTH MEA­SURES MUST STAY</p>
    <p>Now we need to dou­ble down on the pub­lic health mea­sures as we’re wait­ing for the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>DR AN­THONY FAUCI, Amer­ica’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>worsen as peo­ple are more likely to gather in­doors and spend more time in warmer, less-ven­ti­lated ar­eas, al­low­ing the coro­n­avirus to spread. With ac­cess to a vac­cine still some time away, ex­perts say mea­sures to con­tain in­fec­tions must re­main in place for now.</p>
    <p>“We may be tired of Covid-19 but it is not tired of us,” World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said on Thurs­day. “A vac­cine is needed ur­gently, but we can­not wait for a vac­cine and put all our eggs in one bas­ket.”</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist An­thony Fauci con­curred: “Now we need to dou­ble down on the pub­lic health mea­sures as we’re wait­ing for the vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>Asian na­tions are not let­ting up on their ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga yes­ter­day said the gov­ern­ment is on the high­est alert in its virus re­sponse, but added that a state of emer­gency or a halt of a do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign is not nec­es­sary at this point.</p>
    <p>South Korea has started im­pos­ing fines on those caught with­out masks in pub­lic, with of­fend­ers hav­ing to cough up up to 100,000 won (S$120).</p>
    <p>In China, the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion’s deputy min­is­ter Li Bin re­minded ci­ti­zens that the coun­try’s “epi­demic preven­tion and con­trol work can­not be re­laxed for a sin­gle mo­ment”, warn­ing that spo­radic cases or clus­ters might emerge in the win­ter.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers in Europe said there will be no eas­ing of curbs for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>It is “cer­tainly not the mo­ment to loosen the reins”, French Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said on Thurs­day amid a na­tional lock­down, the sec­ond in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s Bavar­ian premier Markus Soeder said: “If we just lower the num­bers a lit­tle bit now and stop too soon, we might fall into a con­stant al­ter­na­tion of lock­down and open­ing.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Trans­port Min­is­ter Grant Shapps said the record daily cases were “a very, very solid re­minder that we have to do the ba­sics” of reg­u­lar hand-wash­ing and main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>But there is grow­ing ev­i­dence that peo­ple, tir­ing of the rules, are in­creas­ingly ig­nor­ing them.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by global polling firm Ifop re­vealed this week that 60 per cent of the French pop­u­la­tion ad­mit­ted to flout­ing anti-virus reg­u­la­tions, tak­ing the coun­try’s cur­rent lock­down far less se­ri­ously than they did the pre­vi­ous one in spring.</p>
    <p>In In­dia – where there are fears that the Deep­avali sea­son could see a new surge in in­fec­tions, 19-year-old stu­dent Tan­isha echoed the sen­ti­ment of many oth­ers: “Peo­ple just don’t care. Peo­ple want to come out.”</p>
