    <p>• Bri­tish re­tail sales surged past their pre-coro­n­avirus level last month, the first full month that shops sell­ing non-es­sen­tial goods were open since the coun­try went into lock­down in March.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rate govern­ment bor­row­ing data showed pub­lic debt rose above £2 tril­lion (S$3.6 tril­lion) last month for t he first time and reached 100.5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) – its high­est as a share of GDP since 1961.</p>
    <p>The un­ex­pect­edly ro­bust re­tail sales fig­ures showed the strength of con­sumer de­mand even as other parts of the econ­omy are strug­gling to re­cover from re­cent hefty losses.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales vol­umes rose by 3.6 per cent from June – above all fore­casts in a Reuters poll of econ­o­mists – and were 1.4 per cent higher than in July last year, the Of­fice for National Sta­tis­tics said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>That rep­re­sented a sharp re­cov­ery from dou­ble-digit falls in April and May.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with Fe­bru­ary, be­fore Bri­tain was broadly af­fected by the pan­demic, sales were 3 per cent higher.</p>
    <p>“This uptick in re­tail con­sump­tion may help ease con­cerns over the fragility of the United King­dom econ­omy – but not for long,” Mr Alis­tair McQueen, head of sav­ings</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­kets and other food shops have ben­e­fited as Bri­tons eat at home more. On­line sales have boomed, and house­hold goods stores have seen strong de­mand. Other ar­eas have suf­fered, with cloth­ing and footwear sales still 25 per cent down on a year ago.</p>
    <p>and re­tire­ment at Aviva, said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s re­tail sec­tor has en­joyed a much faster bounce back than al­most all other parts of the econ­omy hit by the coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>But there have been con­trast­ing ex­pe­ri­ences for dif­fer­ent types of re­tailer.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­kets and other food shops have ben­e­fited as Bri­tons eat at home more. On­line sales have boomed, and house­hold goods stores have seen strong de­mand.</p>
    <p>Other ar­eas have suf­fered, with cloth­ing and footwear sales still 25 per cent down on a year ago.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists fear the broad re­tail re­cov­ery could prove tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>“July’s re­tail sales likely will rep­re­sent this year’s peak,” said Mr Sa­muel Tombs of con­sul­tancy Pan­theon Macroe­co­nomics.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants and bars be­gan to re­open last month, giv­ing peo­ple more op­tions for their spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, un­em­ploy­ment is fore­cast to rise sharply once a govern­ment job sup­port scheme stops at the end of Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Emer­gency state spend­ing and a short­fall in tax rev­enue look set to in­crease bor­row­ing this year to a record £298 bil­lion, the govern­ment’s bud­get fore­cast­ers say.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s fig­ures showed bor­row­ing be­tween April and last month hit £150.5 bil­lion, al­most seven times higher than in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Bor­row­ing in July alone was the low­est since the start of the pan­demic at £26.7 bil­lion. July is a month when tax re­ceipts typ­i­cally boost the pub­lic fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak has in­di­cated that some taxes will need to rise over the medium term.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s fig­ures are a stark re­minder that we must re­turn our pub­lic fi­nances to a sus­tain­able foot­ing over time, which will re­quire tak­ing dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions,” he said.</p>
