    <p>The pan­demic is not only mak­ing peo­ple sick. As it rav­ages the global econ­omy, a study in the United States re­veals a wor­ry­ing trend – as many as 40 mil­lion peo­ple in 17 mil­lion house­holds risk evic­tion by the end of the year due to the in­abil­ity to pay rent.</p>
    <p>Yet, in­ter­views with dozens of land­lords across the coun­try re­turned com­ments like “no dif­fer­ence”, “pleas­antly sur­prised” and “seems like nor­mal”. That view is re­in­forced by the cor­po­rate earn­ings re­ports of hous­ing providers and a weekly sur­vey of big land­lords by the Na­tional Mul­ti­fam­ily Hous­ing Coun­cil, which for sev­eral months has shown lit­tle dif­fer­ence from rent col­lec­tions a year ago.</p>
    <p>On its face, the dis­con­nect be­tween up­beat land­lords and anx­ious tenants seems to ex­pose a glitch in the data or an ex­am­ple of the growing eco­nomic dis­so­nance – like the stock mar­ket’s rise to new heights de­spite a 10.2 per cent un­em­ploy­ment rate.</p>
    <p>What it ac­tu­ally shows is that for all of the govern­ment’s prob­lems in con­tain­ing the virus, fi­nan­cial res­cue ef­forts were largely ef­fec­tive in keep­ing tenants in their homes.</p>
    <p>But those ef­forts have largely lapsed: Only about 20 states have evic­tion mora­to­ri­ums, down from 43 in May.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, mount­ing bills are prompt­ing tenants to take ever more des­per­ate mea­sures, with po­ten­tially dev­as­tat­ing long-term ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Ms Lind­sey Hen­der­son, a laid-off retail bag­ging as­sis­tant, has been pay­ing her rent with a credit card so that she and her hus­band can pre­serve cash and ac­crue points that help save on food and fuel.</p>
    <p>Ms Olivia Mead­ers, 24, was laid off twice from her job as a retail man­ager at a men’s ap­parel store.</p>
    <p>To make enough money to pay rent, she be­gan mak­ing de­liv­er­ies for Post­mates.</p>
    <p>Mr Randy Ping, a 49-year-old street per­former, re­ceived US$3,000 (S$4,100) in do­na­tions from friends and has paid his rent up to next month, but he ex­pects to miss his pay­ment for Oc­to­ber and move out shortly af­ter.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to ask peo­ple to do­nate again,” he said.</p>
    <p>For oth­ers, ef­forts to con­serve money and avoid miss­ing rent have caused them to re­trench on in­vest­ments like education. That bal­anc­ing act, even if it keeps tenants in their homes for now, will not just af­fect the near-term eco­nomic re­cov­ery; it could also cause dam­age that per­ma­nently al­ters the tra­jec­tory of their lives.</p>
    <p>A WOULD-BE PI­LOT GROUNDED</p>
    <p>For as long as she can re­mem­ber, Ms Nura Mosh­tael has dreamt of be­ing a pi­lot for a ma­jor air­line. She studied avi­a­tion in col­lege, but, af­ter giv­ing birth to a son, she spent a dozen years rais­ing him on her own, with­out the time or the money to fin­ish her train­ing.</p>
    <p>Now 45, Ms Mosh­tael de­cided in Jan­uary that it was time to pur­sue be­com­ing a com­mer­cial pi­lot or let her dream slip away. She started two jobs: one at a lo­cal restau­rant and an­other at a cafe inside a Neiman Mar­cus store. It was ex­haust­ing yet en­er­gis­ing; each suc­ces­sive pay cheque was a down pay­ment on hopes for a new ca­reer and a bet­ter life.</p>
    <p>Two months later, af­ter the coro­n­avirus struck, she was fur­loughed from Neiman Mar­cus and laid off from the restau­rant. With the US$600 a week in sup­ple­men­tary ben­e­fits, she was able to keep pay­ing the rent and util­i­ties for her apart­ment in At­lanta. But last month, just as the pay­ments ended, her lease came up for re­newal.</p>
    <p>The US$1,460 a month she was re­ceiv­ing in state un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits – her only in­come – would not cover her ex­penses for rent, a car pay­ment, plus food, util­i­ties and her stu­dent loan.</p>
    <p>Ms Mosh­tael felt she had no choice but to pack up her apart­ment and move in with her mother in her child­hood home. “I’m just lucky I have some­where else to go.”</p>
    <p>Al­though she is re­lieved to not have to worry about rent, the move comes at a sac­ri­fice – the most poignant and per­ma­nent loss for her is the prospect of be­ing a pi­lot.</p>
    <p>“I can’t af­ford to chase that dream any more.”</p>
    <p>FROM A TRIPLED IN­COME TO THE FOOD PANTRY</p>
    <p>Mr Jared Strick­land, 36, and his fi­ancee Karla Den­ning­ton, 34, have been liv­ing with Mr Strick­land’s par­ents for 16 years to save money while he worked in low-pay­ing retail jobs and she stayed home with their three chil­dren, ages 17 months to 14 years old.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, their life changed: Mr Strick­land found a sales job at a time­share com­pany in Florida, and his in­come more than tripled.</p>
    <p>Full of hope, they made plans for things that had been fi­nan­cially out of reach: They set a wed­ding date of Sept 13 and started look­ing for a house to buy.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic hit, Mr Strick­land was fur­loughed and then laid off. His state un­em­ploy­ment pay­ments ran out over a month ago, so their ex­tended family is re­ly­ing on US$150 a week that he gets from the fed­eral Pan­demic Emer­gency Un­em­ploy­ment Com­pen­sa­tion pro­gramme, Mr Strick­land’s par­ents’ So­cial Se­cu­rity pay­ments and his 66-year-old fa­ther’s part-time job as a greeter at Wal­mart.</p>
    <p>To keep food on the ta­ble, they make monthly trips to their lo­cal food pantry.</p>
    <p>“The plan was to save up for six months and then move into our own place,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But then all of a sud­den, this pan­demic hap­pened, I lost my job, and we’re back to square one. We can’t even af­ford food now. There’s no way we’ll be able to move out any time soon.”</p>
    <p>Mount­ing bills are prompt­ing tenants to take ever more des­per­ate mea­sures. Ms Lind­sey Hen­der­son, a laid-off retail bag­ging as­sis­tant, has been pay­ing her rent with a credit card so that she and her hus­band can pre­serve cash and ac­crue points that help save on food and fuel.</p>
