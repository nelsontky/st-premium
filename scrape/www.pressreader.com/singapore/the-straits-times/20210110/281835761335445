    <p>As a stu­dent at the Madrasah Alju­nied Al-Is­lamiah, Ab­dul Hakam Nor Razak had to take 10 sub­jects as part of the Is­lamic cur­ricu­lum at the re­li­gious school.</p>
    <p>On top of that, he was en­rolled in the In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate Diploma Pro­gramme (IBDP).</p>
    <p>Early last week, the 18-year-old was one of 25 stu­dents in the madrasah who re­ceived their IB re­sults. They are the pi­o­neer batch in this pro­gramme, which be­gan in Jan­uary 2019.</p>
    <p>Even while jug­gling it with his Is­lamic ed­u­ca­tion, Hakam man­aged to score 42 points out of the max­i­mum 45. He was the madrasah’s top scorer.</p>
    <p>The IB cur­ricu­lum con­sists of six sub­jects and three core com­po­nents – namely the­ory of knowl­edge, an ex­tended es­say, and cre­ativ­ity, ac­tiv­ity and ser­vice.</p>
    <p>In this last com­po­nent, stu­dents have to com­plete a project re­lated to those three con­cepts.</p>
    <p>Hakam’s six cho­sen sub­jects were chem­istry, math­e­mat­ics, Ara­bic, English, Malay lit­er­a­ture and pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>On how he did so well, he said: “I en­joy learn­ing and study­ing isn’t a chore for me.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the hol­i­days, I read up about science and maths, which sup­ple­mented my knowl­edge about the sub­jects.”</p>
    <p>He also has a keen in­ter­est in pol­i­tics and English. He fre­quently reads news ar­ti­cles and keeps track of global af­fairs.</p>
    <p>But jug­gling the IBDP and his Is­lamic ed­u­ca­tion was not easy, he said. Over the two years, most school days started at 7.30am and ran till 5pm.</p>
    <p>While he has com­pleted the IBDP, his Is­lamic classes have not ended. He still has about two months of school left.</p>
    <p>Hakam said he was ini­tially anx­ious at the thought of be­ing part of the madrasah’s pi­o­neer IBDP batch.</p>
    <p>“We had no se­niors to talk to and seek ad­vice from, and I was also quite anx­ious about the school’s pre­pared­ness for the pro­gramme – whether the teach­ers had the right train­ing and whether I could get a good score.”</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Singapore (Muis) said the IBDP com­ple­ments the school­based Is­lamic Stud­ies cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>“The learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, train­ing, ex­po­sure, re­search and in­ves­ti­ga­tion rigour, as well as com­mu­nity ser­vice ac­tiv­i­ties and en­gage­ments not only pre­pare stu­dents for univer­sity life but also the nec­es­sary think­ing skills and per­spec­tives,” said Muis, adding that th­ese are crit­i­cal for fu­ture re­li­gious schol­ars and lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing com­pleted the pro­gramme, Hakam said he likes that stu­dents’ grades in the IBDP are not solely based on their fi­nal ex­ams.</p>
    <p>He added: “We also have as­sign­ments that are kind of like a mini the­sis, where we have to re­search on some­thing and do a write-up on it.</p>
    <p>“The IB al­lows us to ex­plore our ar­eas of in­ter­est in­de­pen­dently, and it was some­thing I en­joyed.”</p>
