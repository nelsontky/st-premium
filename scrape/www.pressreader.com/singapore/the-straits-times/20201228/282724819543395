    <p>DOU­BLE BLESS­INGS: One of the worst-kept se­crets in Hong Kong en­ter­tain­ment is out: Ac­tress Jen­nifer Yu is preg­nant.</p>
    <p>Yu, 27, sur­prised fans in Oc­to­ber when she an­nounced she would be mar­ry­ing her boyfriend Tim Luk, 40. She kept mum about the ru­mours dur­ing her wed­ding to Mr Luk last month, though the Hong Kong me­dia said there were signs of a pos­si­ble preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>Yu, who has acted in movies such as Men On The Dragon (2018) and Tracey (2018), fi­nally con­firmed the ru­mours last Fri­day. She posted a photo (far left) of her and her hus­band in front of a Christ­mas tree and wrote “All I want for Christ­mas is YOU”, with the hash­tags #MomToBe and #DadToBe.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong ac­tress My­olie Wu, 41, re­vealed her preg­nancy on the same day, post­ing on so­cial me­dia a photo (left) of her­self with a vis­i­ble baby bump.</p>
    <p>She wrote in Chi­nese: “I am from a fam­ily with two other sis­ters and have ex­pe­ri­enced the ben­e­fits of three sis­ters to­gether since I was a child. I have al­ways felt that hav­ing three chil­dren would be a very beau­ti­ful and happy thing. I would like to tell ev­ery­one on Christ­mas 2020 that my wish has come true.”</p>
    <p>Wu, who is known for roles in TVB dra­mas such as Wars Of In-Laws (2005) and To Grow With Love (2006), has been mar­ried to hus­band Philip Lee for five years. They have two sons: Bren­dan, three, and Ryan, who is 17 months old.</p>
