    <p>When charged with a crim­i­nal of­fence or slapped with a civil law­suit, some do not know whom to turn to, while oth­ers re­alise there is help only late in the process.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite pub­lic­ity sur­round­ing pro bono services for crim­i­nal and non-crim­i­nal mat­ters, and free ad­vice reg­u­larly of­fered at legal clin­ics. For ex­am­ple, the Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre holds such a clinic ev­ery first and third Satur­day of the month.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of access to legal help was high­lighted this month in the case in­volv­ing In­done­sian Parti Liyani. Ac­cused of theft in 2016 by her em­ploy­ers and con­victed for the crime, the for­mer maid was cleared of all charges ear­lier this month af­ter her pro bono lawyer Anil Balchan­dani fought for her ac­quit­tal.</p>
    <p>Her em­ploy­ers of eight years were Changi Air­port Group’s for­mer chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>It was a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) – the Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home) – that helped her se­cure a lawyer.</p>
    <p>The case prompted a num­ber of par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to file ques­tions on the is­sue, with the Work­ers’ Party say­ing it has filed a mo­tion to speak on eq­uity in the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said he will make a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the is­sues raised in Ms Parti’s case.</p>
    <p>NGOs and lawyers said that access to jus­tice for peo­ple with lesser means can be ham­pered by a lack of knowl­edge of legal aid schemes.</p>
    <p>They may also fail to meet the re­quire­ments for schemes such as those pro­vided by the Legal Aid Bureau, where an ap­pli­cant’s av­er­age per capita gross monthly house­hold in­come must be $950 or less for the 12 months prior to the ap­pli­ca­tion, among other things.</p>
    <p>The bureau’s aid is only for Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent residents who pass the means and mer­its test, or for mat­ters con­cern­ing in­ter­na­tional child ab­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>In Ms Parti’s case, her legal bat­tle was fought with the help of the Law So­ci­ety Pro Bono Services’ (LSPBS) Crim­i­nal Legal Aid Scheme.</p>
    <p>If Mr Anil had not taken the case pro bono, it would have cost her $150,000.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 lawyers are reg­is­tered with the scheme, which pro­vides crim­i­nal legal aid to the poor and needy. Aid was granted to over half of all ap­pli­ca­tions to the scheme in the last two years, an LSPBS spokesman told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“This was the same for Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent residents and for­eign­ers, in­clud­ing mi­grant work­ers. Ap­pli­ca­tions are as­sessed on the same rig­or­ous means and mer­its tests,” said the spokesman, adding that about 200 lawyers with the scheme are cur­rently ac­tive.</p>
    <p>NGOs like Home and Tran­sient Work­ers Count Too (TWC2) also have their own net­work of lawyers whom they tap for legal help.</p>
    <p>The two or­gan­i­sa­tions are among sev­eral groups that or­gan­ise legal clin­ics for peo­ple to seek ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Home said that when for­eign work­ers are in trou­ble with the law, they are sel­dom of­fered in­for­ma­tion by the prose­cut­ing and in­ves­ti­gat­ing au­thor­i­ties about their legal</p>
    <p>rights and the re­sources avail­able to them.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for TWC2 said a few such work­ers who ap­proach NGOs like TWC2 can be re­ferred to a pro bono lawyer when it is timely and ap­pro­pri­ate. “The un­for­tu­nate rest of them have to go at it alone and per­son­ally de­fend them­selves in court,” added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>When peo­ple fail to meet the cri­te­ria in legal aid schemes, it can be dif­fi­cult to ob­tain legal rep­re­sen­ta­tion on a pro bono or even “low bono” ba­sis, said crim­i­nal lawyer Suang Wi­jaya, who has worked on sev­eral pro bono cases. He is with the Eu­gene Thu­raisingam law firm.</p>
    <p>“They can con­duct their own crim­i­nal case as an ‘ac­cused in per­son’, but the tech­ni­cal­i­ties of the laws of pro­ce­dure and ev­i­dence make this task ex­tremely dif­fi­cult. For such per­sons, it can be al­most im­pos­si­ble to ob­tain access to jus­tice,” he said.</p>
    <p>There is some limited help for for­eign work­ers in civil law­suit mat­ters, with non-gov­ern­men­tal group Jus­tice With­out Bor­ders spe­cial­is­ing in help­ing for­eign work­ers with cross-bor­der law­suits.</p>
    <p>The out­fit, whose Sin­ga­pore of­fice was set up five years ago, has re­viewed more than 250 cases for po­ten­tial claims in­volv­ing do­mes­tic work­ers who have since re­turned home.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude cases in­volv­ing the il­le­gal de­ploy­ment of maids, al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual as­sault or abuse, and il­le­gal over­charg­ing by em­ploy­ment agen­cies, said Ms Tan Jun Yin, who heads the group’s Sin­ga­pore of­fice.</p>
    <p>TWC2’s spokesman sug­gested ex­pand­ing the Min­istry of Law’s Legal Aid Bureau scheme to help mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers sug­gested that the vul­ner­a­ble can be made aware of the legal help avail­able to them at the ear­li­est pos­si­ble in­stance, such as when po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Crim­i­nal Lawyers Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Su­nil Sud­heesan said that be­yond legal aid, “access to jus­tice also means knowl­edge of rights”.</p>
    <p>“Take for ex­am­ple a crim­i­nal lawyer who gets ar­rested by the po­lice, ver­sus a for­eign do­mes­tic worker who is ar­rested. One is armed with greater knowl­edge of the legal pro­ce­dures... and the other doesn’t have a clue,” he said.</p>
    <p>When peo­ple know their rights and legal pro­ce­dures, they would be bet­ter able to make de­ci­sions on what in­for­ma­tion they should pro­vide to the au­thor­i­ties, he said.</p>
    <p>“As a so­ci­ety, we want the truth to be dis­cov­ered in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion stage in a thor­ough man­ner.”</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CULT TASK</p>
    <p>They can con­duct their own crim­i­nal case as an ‘ac­cused in per­son’, but the tech­ni­cal­i­ties of the laws of pro­ce­dure and ev­i­dence make this task ex­tremely dif­fi­cult. For such per­sons, it can be al­most im­pos­si­ble to ob­tain access to jus­tice.</p>
    <p>CRIM­I­NAL LAWYER SUANG WI­JAYA, not­ing that it can be dif­fi­cult to ob­tain legal rep­re­sen­ta­tion on a pro bono or even “low bono” ba­sis when peo­ple fail to meet the cri­te­ria in legal aid schemes.</p>
