    <p>Shares of Kep­pel Corp sank yes­ter­day, amid un­cer­tainty over the fate of Te­masek’s $4.1 bil­lion takeover of­fer for the loss-mak­ing con­glom­er­ate. The stock closed at $5.18, down 22 cents or 4.1 per cent, with 8.13 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, Mor­gan Stan­ley Asia (Sin­ga­pore) said Te­masek will de­cide by the end of this month whether to in­voke the ma­te­rial ad­verse change (MAC) clause in its par­tial of­fer for Kep­pel.</p>
    <p>The con­glom­er­ate last Thurs­day posted a record quar­terly net loss of $697.6 mil­lion for the se­cond quar­ter, dragged by a mas­sive $919 mil­lion im­pair­ment, breach­ing cer­tain con­di­tions for the of­fer.</p>
    <p>Un­der the MAC clause, Kep­pel’s profit af­ter tax must not fall by more than 20 per cent or about $557 mil­lion over the cu­mu­la­tive four quar­ters from the third quar­ter of last year.</p>
    <p>Given the MAC non-ful­fil­ment, Te­masek now has three op­tions – waive the breach and con­tinue with the cash of­fer at the $7.35 per share price, in­voke the MAC clause and walk away from the deal en­tirely, or lower the of­fer price with the ap­proval of the Se­cu­rity In­dus­try Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>If com­pleted, the pre-con­di­tional par­tial of­fer would raise the in­vest­ment firm’s stake in the con­glom­er­ate to 51 per cent, giv­ing Te­masek con­trol of Kep­pel. Te­masek, which al­ready owns about one-fifth of Kep­pel, an­nounced the of­fer last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have main­tained their “buy” or “add” rec­om­men­da­tions on Kep­pel, although they re­duced their tar­get prices on the stock.</p>
    <p>CGS-CIMB slashed its tar­get price to $6.46, from $7.48 pre­vi­ously, while keep­ing its “add” rat­ing.</p>
    <p>An­a­lyst Lim Siew Khee wrote last Fri­day: “We be­lieve the cur­rent share price has fac­tored in some risk of deal can­cel­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>If Te­masek walks away from the deal, Kep­pel’s share price could re­act in a shock and touch its pre­vi­ous trough of 0.82 times price to book value in early 2016 dur­ing the last oil cri­sis, or $4.88, Ms Lim added.</p>
    <p>DBS Group Re­search an­a­lyst Ho Pei Hwa yes­ter­day pointed out that there is now un­cer­tainty re­gard­ing Te­masek’s par­tial of­fer.</p>
    <p>With Kep­pel’s lat­est re­sults, the 12-month trail­ing profit af­ter tax now stands at a loss of $165 mil­lion and will re­quire $887 mil­lion in profit af­ter tax in the third quar­ter of this year in or­der to meet the MAC clause. “This seems rather un­re­al­is­tic, given the av­er­age quar­terly profit of $200 mil­lion over the past four years,” Ms Ho said.</p>
    <p>At the end of the day, the game plan to cre­ate a sin­gle Sin­ga­pore-based O&M (off­shore and marine) com­pany to com­pete with the likes of the Korean or Chi­nese O&M be­he­moths makes eco­nomic sense, and is bet­ter car­ried out dur­ing a cy­cle trough rather than mid or peak cy­cle.</p>
    <p>DBS, which has a “buy” call on the stock, low­ered its 12-month price tar­get to $6.40, from $6.80.</p>
    <p>UOB Kay Hian said it re­mained “rea­son­ably con­fi­dent” Te­masek will con­tinue with the of­fer, al­beit likely at a lower of­fer price.</p>
    <p>UOB Kay Hian an­a­lyst Adrian Loh noted that the ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ings for Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries and Sem­b­corp Marine’s pro­posed rights is­sue and de­merger will take place next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Should th­ese two firms’ share­hold­ers vote for the de­merger, the like­li­hood of Te­masek go­ing for­ward with the Kep­pel par­tial of­fer will be “much higher”, in the bro­ker­age’s view, Mr Loh said.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, the game plan to cre­ate a sin­gle Sin­ga­pore­based O&M (off­shore and marine) com­pany to com­pete with the likes of the Korean or Chi­nese O&M be­he­moths makes eco­nomic sense, and is bet­ter car­ried out dur­ing a cy­cle trough rather than mid or peak cy­cle,” he said.</p>
    <p>UOB Kay Hian low­ered its tar­get price on Kep­pel to $7.10, from $7.15, while main­tain­ing its “buy” rat­ing.</p>
    <p>KGI Se­cu­ri­ties re­search head Joel Ng said yes­ter­day: “We still be­lieve that Te­masek will drive the con­sol­i­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s O&M sec­tor, and that the deal will likely go through.”</p>
    <p>This comes as the global O&M in­dus­try is un­der­go­ing sig­nif­i­cant struc­tural shifts, ex­ac­er­bated by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said: “Fur­ther­more, cost re­duc­tions in the O&M sec­tor are lim­ited this time around, given that most of the ef­fi­ciency gains oc­curred in 2015-2018.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, there is no choice but to con­sol­i­date and lay the proper ground­work to cap­i­talise on long-term in­dus­try trends.”</p>
    <p>GOOD GAME PLAN</p>
