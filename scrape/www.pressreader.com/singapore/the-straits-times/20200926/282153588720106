    <p>In­ter­na­tional fer­vour for mass-mar­ket tourism con­tin­ues to com­pel gov­ern­ments to re­open bor­ders, rais­ing ques­tions about how to pre­vent an im­por­ta­tion of trav­ellers who are ei­ther symp­tomat­i­cally or asymp­tomat­i­cally car­ry­ing the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral gov­ern­ments, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s, have pru­dently re­lied on mul­ti­lat­eral travel pacts to al­low es­sen­tial busi­ness and tourism travel to re­sume, es­pe­cially be­tween coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a sim­i­lar level of Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, other coun­tries, es­pe­cially in Europe, have per­mit­ted a greater de­gree of un­re­stricted cross-bor­der move­ments dur­ing th­ese sum­mer months, re­sult­ing in wor­ry­ing surges of new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore re­cently de­clared that it in­tends to fur­ther ease mea­sures, re­ly­ing on a pru­dent mix of quar­an­tine and test­ing at all land, air and sea bor­ders to catch any in­fected trav­ellers early, be­fore they have a chance to min­gle with the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Im­pos­ing a pe­riod of quar­an­tine – 14 days in the con­text of Covid-19 – is a tra­di­tional and proven pub­lichealth safety net to pre­vent an in­com­ing trav­eller from spread­ing any dis­ease to an im­muno­log­i­cally naive pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>But this is not vi­able for mass­mar­ket tourism, where cost and du­ra­tion of a holiday are of­ten the pri­mary de­ter­mi­nants.</p>
    <p>Thus, the ques­tion that many are ask­ing is: Surely, in this day and age, we should be able to rely on de­ploy­ing fast and af­ford­able tests on every trav­eller and do away with quar­an­tine al­to­gether, to al­low the bor­ders to re­open com­pletely?</p>
    <p>In fact, why stop at screen­ing in­com­ing trav­ellers?</p>
    <p>We could even de­ploy th­ese tests to screen en­tire pop­u­la­tions and aim for an elim­i­na­tion strat­egy to com­pletely erad­i­cate the pres­ence of Sars-CoV-2 in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The an­swer has to do with false dis­cov­er­ies and false neg­a­tives.</p>
    <p>FALSE DIS­COV­ER­IES</p>
    <p>With in­fec­tion test­ing, there are two def­i­ni­tions of ac­cu­racy: sen­si­tiv­ity – the abil­ity to cor­rectly iden­tify some­one who is in­fected with Covid-19; and speci­ficity – the abil­ity to cor­rectly iden­tify some­one who is gen­uinely healthy and free from Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>A per­fectly ac­cu­rate test means there is no er­ror in de­ter­min­ing the in­fected among the healthy all the time. But there is no per­fect test in re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Many di­ag­nos­tic tests fo­cus on mak­ing sure they do not mis­di­ag­nose some­one who is truly in­fected – that is, pre­vent­ing false neg­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, this also comes at the ex­pense of mis­la­belling some healthy in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>And this is where the prob­lem of false dis­cov­er­ies arises, es­pe­cially when the num­ber of in­fected is just a tiny frac­tion of the to­tal num­ber of trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Con­sider a sce­nario where Sin­ga­pore sees 1,000 in­fected from among one mil­lion trav­ellers com­ing through its bor­ders monthly, or an in­fec­tion preva­lence of just 0.1 per cent of in­com­ing trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>A test kit with near-per­fect per­for­mance, yield­ing 100 per cent sen­si­tiv­ity and 99 per cent speci­ficity, will cor­rectly iden­tify all 1,000 in­fected trav­ellers, but in­cor­rectly la­bel al­most 10,000 healthy trav­ellers as in­fected.</p>
    <p>Oper­a­tionally, we would not be able to distin­guish be­tween the 11,000 pos­i­tive re­sults.</p>
    <p>In other words, only one out of every 11 pos­i­tive tests is ac­tu­ally a true in­fec­tion and the re­main­ing 10 are false pos­i­tives, lead­ing to an over­whelm­ing oc­cur­rence of false dis­cov­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Clearly, if every pos­i­tive case is tested again, it will sig­nif­i­cantly whit­tle down the num­ber of mis­di­ag­nosed pos­i­tive cases.</p>
    <p>But this adds ex­tra cost and de­lays to travel plans, and un­cer­tain­ties are al­ways a de­ter­rent when it comes to travel.</p>
    <p>If the pro­to­col dic­tates that any­one who tests pos­i­tive will be hos­pi­talised for 21 days of clin­i­cal ob­ser­va­tion, the eco­nomic cost of false dis­cov­er­ies es­ca­lates rapidly, since the ma­jor­ity of th­ese trav­ellers will be ex­pected to bear the full hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion costs.</p>
    <p>FALSE NEG­A­TIVES</p>
    <p>The na­ture of travel may also in­tro­duce false neg­a­tives as all cur­rently avail­able test kits are un­able to de­tect the pres­ence of Sars-CoV-2 dur­ing the first few days of the in­fec­tion, known as the in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Con­sider a sce­nario where an in­fec­tious trav­eller takes a plane into Sin­ga­pore and, in the process, un­wit­tingly in­fects sev­eral fel­low pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>This in­fected trav­eller will al­most cer­tainly be picked up dur­ing bor­der screen­ing, but those who were newly in­fected dur­ing the flight will not test pos­i­tive, given that the in­cu­ba­tion lag time ex­ceeds the flight du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>In fact, this may be why in­fec­tions con­tinue to per­sist among mi­grant work­ers de­spite the dec­la­ra­tion of clear­ance for all the dor­mi­to­ries – the batch test­ing of more than 300,000 work­ers is likely to see a num­ber of false neg­a­tives when newly ac­quired in­fec­tions hap­pened to be tested dur­ing the in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The present quar­an­tine re­quire­ment of 14 days ac­tu­ally serves to guard against the false neg­a­tives from sec­ondary in­fec­tions dur­ing tran­sit, be­sides pick­ing up pri­mary in­fec­tions ac­quired prior to com­menc­ing travel.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, test­ing all trav­ellers at the end of the 14-day quar­an­tine pre­vents miss­ing any</p>
    <p>asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>A COM­PRO­MISE hub for trade and com­merce, and re­open­ing the na­tion’s bor­ders is ex­is­ten­tial to the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This ex­plains the need to ex­per­i­ment with dif­fer­ent bor­der con­trol strate­gies to bal­ance the risk of in­fec­tions and the risk of failed liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Al­ready the length of quar­an­tine has been re­duced to seven days from Sept 1 for trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from a short­list of low-risk coun­tries that have suc­cess­fully con­tained the out­break and pos­sess strin­gent pub­lic health mea­sures for man­ag­ing com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Short-term vis­i­tors and re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans from Brunei and New Zealand are even per­mit­ted to en­ter Sin­ga­pore with­out hav­ing to serve any pe­riod of quar­an­tine, as long as they pro­duce a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, given their Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, it is highly un­likely that any­one com­ing from th­ese coun­tries will be in­fected in the first place.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore even launched a Safe Travel Of­fice, whose man­date is to ex­plore, es­tab­lish and reg­u­larly eval­u­ate pro­to­cols to re­sume some de­gree of nor­malcy for travel and avi­a­tion while man­ag­ing im­por­ta­tion risk.</p>
    <p>Find­ing a so­lu­tion to the co­nun­drums of false dis­cov­er­ies and false neg­a­tives must be part of this man­date.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, we have to be mind­ful not to be lulled into a false sense of se­cu­rity be­cause of our quar­an­tine and mass-test­ing strat­egy at the bor­ders, and in­stead be men­tally pre­pared that there may be the rare few im­ported cases that will slip past de­spite th­ese mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mass screen­ing at the bor­ders re­mains but one el­e­ment of a suite of pub­lic health mea­sures that in­clude con­tact trac­ing and swift iso­la­tion and quar­an­tine of ex­posed in­di­vid­u­als to break any com­mu­nity in­fec­tion chain, just as how mask wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing will al­ways re­main as the last line of per­sonal de­fence.</p>
    <p>We have to be mind­ful not to be lulled into a false sense of se­cu­rity be­cause of our quar­an­tine and mass-test­ing strat­egy at the bor­ders, and in­stead be men­tally pre­pared that there may be the rare few im­ported cases that will slip past de­spite th­ese mea­sures.</p>
