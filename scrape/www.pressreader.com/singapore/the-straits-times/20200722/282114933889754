    <p>In­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies in Singapore will soon be able to buy and sell so­lar en­ergy with one an­other to power their homes and busi­nesses, if a joint pi­lot project in­volv­ing power gen­er­a­tion com­pany Senoko En­ergy proves successful.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Senoko En­ergy launched the six-month pi­lot to in­tro­duce peer-to-peer (P2P) trad­ing of re­new­able en­ergy in the citys­tate, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Singapore en­ergy in­no­va­tion firm Elec­trify as well as Engie Fac­tory, the ven­ture arm of French multi­na­tional elec­tric util­ity firm Engie.</p>
    <p>Spon­sored by Engie Fac­tory, the ini­tia­tive will al­low Singapore house­holds and busi­nesses to reg­is­ter for the P2P trad­ing plat­form de­vel­oped by Elec­trify, through Senoko En­ergy’s new ser­vice of­fer­ing So­larShare.</p>
    <p>Af­ter reg­is­ter­ing, pro­duc­ers and con­sumers will be able to trade lo­cally pro­duced so­lar en­ergy.</p>
    <p>So­larShare en­ables the match­ing of al­most real-time en­ergy gen­er­a­tion and en­ergy us­age, tracked us­ing smart me­ters.</p>
    <p>Users will see “dy­namic” pric­ing of their green elec­tric­ity rates, as they can deter­mine their own buy­ing and sell­ing prices through the mar­ket­place, the three com­pa­nies said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>New and ex­ist­ing Senoko En­ergy cus­tomers can opt to par­tic­i­pate in the pi­lot project, al­though there is an ini­tial limit of 100 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot will test the po­ten­tial for com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of this new en­ergy of­fer­ing, with the even­tual goal of rolling it out to all house­holds and busi­nesses in Singapore.</p>
    <p>In P2P en­ergy trad­ing, elec­tric­ity pro­duc­ers with rooftop so­lar pan­els can di­rectly sell the ex­cess elec­tric­ity they pro­duce to other local con­sumers across the net­work.</p>
    <p>Elec­trify’s trad­ing plat­form will use real-time data at 30-minute in­ter­vals, for users to com­pare the amount of en­ergy sup­plied, the mar­ket de­mand and the prices of­fered.</p>
    <p>Both res­i­den­tial and com­mer­cial users will be able to view the avail­able so­lar pro­duc­ers, and choose whom to buy from based on their en­ergy us­age.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing non-day­light hours or when the sup­ply of so­lar en­ergy is limited, en­ergy de­mand will con­tinue to be met by Senoko En­ergy, so that there is no dis­rup­tion in the phys­i­cal sup­ply of elec­tric­ity.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers who buy green en­ergy from the P2P plat­form will re­ceive a con­sol­i­dated bill from Senoko En­ergy at the end of each month.</p>
    <p>Elec­trify’s chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder Martin Lim said its plat­form is “one of the very few in the world” that al­low trad­ing across a na­tional elec­tric­ity grid.</p>
    <p>“With this tech­nol­ogy, Sin­ga­pore­ans will get ac­cess to a re­li­able, se­cure and trans­par­ent plat­form to buy and sell re­new­able en­ergy,” he added.</p>
    <p>Senoko En­ergy’s head of com­mer­cial di­vi­sion James Chong said that adop­tion of the in­no­va­tive con­cept of P2P en­ergy trad­ing is still in its early stages around the globe.</p>
    <p>Senoko En­ergy de­cided to in­vest in So­larShare so as to “em­power Sin­ga­pore­ans with greater choice in their elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion” and to meet Singapore’s re­new­able en­ergy de­mand, he said.</p>
    <p>A “pro­sumer” cul­ture will strengthen Singapore’s en­ergy se­cu­rity, as pro­duc­ers can con­trib­ute ex­cess en­ergy to the grid while con­sumers can choose where their elec­tric­ity comes from at their pre­ferred prices, he added.</p>
    <p>Just over 1,200 pri­vate res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties in Singapore have so­lar rooftop in­stal­la­tions, and there is po­ten­tial for as many as 65,000 in­stal­la­tions in the country, noted Engie Fac­tory’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Quentin Va­que­tte.</p>
    <p>“Through this pi­lot P2P project, we hope to en­cour­age more Sin­ga­pore­ans to adopt re­new­ables and help lower our na­tion’s carbon foot­print,” Mr Va­que­tte said.</p>
    <p>Par­ties can reg­is­ter their in­ter­est at www.so­larshare.sg</p>
    <p>To take part in the trial, par­tic­i­pants also have to sign up for a Senoko En­ergy plan to meet their en­ergy needs dur­ing non-sun hours.</p>
    <p>At the end of the six-month con­tract du­ra­tion in the So­larShare pi­lot, par­tic­i­pants can choose to con­tinue with Senoko En­ergy or switch to SP Group or any other re­tailer.</p>
