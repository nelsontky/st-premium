    <p>This past week marked the 100th an­niver­sary of Mamie Smith record­ing Crazy Blues, African Amer­i­can women’s break­through into the main­stream record­ing in­dus­try – a feat that is stun­ning and im­pact­ful, yet so of­ten mis­un­der­stood or for­got­ten that most peo­ple would be hard pressed to name the artist whose smash al­tered the course of pop.</p>
    <p>And al­though they are rarely ac­knowl­edged in his­to­ries of mu­sic, the black women and girls who re­sponded to Smith’s sound en masse helped up­end the anti-black­ness of Amer­ica’s nascent record busi­ness in the early 20th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>In the sum­mer of 1920, Smith, the Cincin­nati-born New York vaudevil­lian, walked into a stu­dio with Perry Brad­ford, a shrewd song­writer-mu­si­cian and blues busi­ness hus­tler. They were on a mis­sion to coun­ter­act the in­dus­try’s pre­vi­ous decade, when white blues artists such as Marion Har­ris were break­ing out with their own recorded ren­di­tions of black mu­sic while African Amer­i­can en­ter­tain­ers – leg­ends like Ma Rainey, Ethel Waters and Bessie Smith – were con­fined to venues des­ig­nated for black per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>For Smith and Brad­ford, one of the big­gest questions was whether they could prove to record ex­ec­u­tives that black mu­sic fans mat­tered.</p>
    <p>Their strat­egy was sim­ple yet novel: al­low an African Amer­i­can fe­male blues vo­cal­ist to ap­peal to black lis­ten­ers, prov­ing they had a taste for pop­u­lar sounds while spot­light­ing the artistry and se­ri­ous­ness of the singer and her ac­com­pa­ny­ing band.</p>
    <p>Re­leased in Novem­ber 1920, Smith’s grip­ping and ram­bunc­tious Crazy Blues hit all of those bench­marks and more. In its nearly 3½ min­utes, Smith sings in a ro­bust vi­brato atop horns and wood­winds, lament­ing a love af­fair that brings her a boat­load of pain.</p>
    <p>The re­ac­tion to the song, par­tic­u­larly among black au­di­ences, was ground­break­ing.</p>
    <p>It was an ex­pres­sion of the grandeur and com­plex­ity of black life, fi­nally avail­able for their phono­graph. Sales fig­ures for Crazy Blues show an es­ti­mated 75,000 copies pur­chased upon its re­lease and, in 1921, Bill­board cred­ited the song as pulling in “a mil­lion dol­lars’ worth”, a giant sum at the time.</p>
    <p>Black record­ing artists sub­se­quently made sig­nif­i­cant in­roads rid­ing the coat­tails of Smith’s suc­cess. Blues women dom­i­nated the first half of the decade, with Waters, Rainey and Bessie Smith at the fore­front of the craze.</p>
    <p>Rainey, called “the Mother of the Blues”, signed with Paramount Records in 1923 and would go on to crank out more than 100 songs cov­er­ing top­ics like les­bian pride and the per­ils of pa­tri­archy. And that other Smith, the “Em­press” Bessie, would hold court at Columbia Records as the most for­mi­da­ble and orig­i­nal voice of the blues. These were the pi­o­neers who up­ended the sound­track of Amer­i­can life.</p>
    <p>Pop mu­sic was trans­formed by a peo­ple whose mu­si­cal in­no­va­tions were – and re­main to­day – the man­i­fes­ta­tion of a bru­tal, cen­turies long, blood-soaked strug­gle to be re­garded as hu­man in the West.</p>
    <p>The cul­ture of the black record shops evolved through the post-World War II era, and his­to­rian Joshua Clark Davis said that it played a big part in fos­ter­ing com­mu­nity as “black pub­lic spa­ces” – safe, con­vivial places black folk could call their own, and they were or­gan­ised around ex­plor­ing, think­ing about, dis­cussing and pur­chas­ing – lay­ing claim to – mu­sic.</p>
    <p>This is the com­pelling for­got­ten his­tory sparked by Crazy Blues that is worth lin­ger­ing on: the sites and cul­tural rit­u­als cre­ated by black record lovers, par­tic­u­larly women.</p>
    <p>Growing up in the Bay Area in the 1970s and 1980s, the pil­grim­ages my friends and I made to the record stores were steeped in hard-core fan­dom and a pur­suit of knowl­edge about Prince, Bowie and The Po­lice and, later in my Gen-X 20s, riot gr­rrl and neo-soul.</p>
    <p>The 2020 Hulu re­boot of High Fi­delity, star­ring Zoe Kravitz, gets as close to this kind of feel­ing that I have ever seen as it plays with the orig­i­nal’s white mas­cu­line ideas about pop mu­sic cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Fan­dom mat­ters in High Fi­delity 2.0, just as it did in the orig­i­nal. But the fans are now black women, each</p>
