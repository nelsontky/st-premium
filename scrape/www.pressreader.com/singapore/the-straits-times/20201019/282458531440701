    <p>SYD­NEY • Each year, hun­dreds of peo­ple die in Aus­tralia af­ter be­ing in­fected by cat-de­pen­dent dis­eases, and the im­pact on the Aus­tralian econ­omy has been fi­nally quan­ti­fied by Aus­tralian re­searchers and re­leased on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The study, led by Pro­fes­sor Sarah Legge from the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity and the Univer­sity of Queens­land, found that such dis­eases caused more than 500 deaths and 11,000 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions in Aus­tralia each year, cost­ing the Aus­tralian econ­omy A$6 bil­lion (S$5.8 bil­lion) a year.</p>
    <p>Prof Legge said the cost they stud­ied in­cluded med­i­cal treat­ment, lost in­come and other rea­son­able rel­e­vant ex­penses re­lated to the cat-de­pen­dent dis­eases, which were not pre­sented in Aus­tralia un­til cats ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“Tox­o­plas­mo­sis, cat round­worm and cat-scratch disease ar­rived in Aus­tralia with cats in 1788. The pathogens that cause these dis­eases de­pend on cats for part of their life cy­cle, so with­out cats, these dis­eases wouldn’t be here,” she said.</p>
    <p>Among those three dis­eases, tox­o­plas­mo­sis, which is caused by a sin­gle-cell par­a­site called Tox­o­plasma gondii, causes the great­est dam­age to hu­man health in Aus­tralia and can be lethal to im­muno­com­pro­mised peo­ple and un­born ba­bies, ac­cord­ing to Prof Legge.</p>
    <p>“Some of the most in­sid­i­ous ef­fects of the Tox­o­plasma gondii par­a­site come from the pos­si­ble long-term ef­fects on be­hav­iour and men­tal health,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Tox­o­plasma gondii in­fec­tions may in­crease risk-tak­ing be­hav­iour and re­duce re­ac­tion times, and this may ex­plain why peo­ple in­volved in car ac­ci­dents are more likely to have Tox­o­plasma gondii in­fec­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that with­out this par­a­site, about 200 deaths and 6,500 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions due to car ac­ci­dents could be avoided in Aus­tralia each year.</p>
    <p>Tox­o­plasma gondii in­fec­tions are also as­so­ci­ated with a higher risk of many men­tal health dis­or­ders, she added. “One in five cases of schizophre­nia and one in 10 sui­cides and sui­cide at­tempts could be avoided if we elim­i­nated Tox­o­plasma gondii in­fec­tions.”</p>
    <p>To re­duce the hu­man in­fec­tion rate of cat-de­pen­dent dis­eases, re­searchers sug­gest cat own­ers keep their pet cats in­doors at all times and wash their hands thor­oughly af­ter han­dling cat lit­ter or gar­den­ing.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to re­duce the feral cat pop­u­la­tion around res­i­den­tial ar­eas, ac­cord­ing to the study’s co-au­thor, Dr John Read from the Univer­sity of Ade­laide in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>“Feral cats around towns are a disease reser­voir. Peo­ple can keep the feral cat pop­u­la­tion down by not feed­ing strays or let­ting them ac­cess bins, de­sex­ing pet cats by five months and sup­port­ing lo­cal gov­ern­ment ini­tia­tives to man­age cats,” he said.</p>
