    <p>More Sin­ga­porean lawyers are get­ting the op­por­tu­nity to work in in­ter­na­tional law firms, with about 40 of the 100 top firms in the world hav­ing of­fices here.</p>
    <p>The nine Qual­i­fied For­eign Law Prac­tices (QFLPs), among some of the top-gross­ing firms, em­ploy more than 500 lawyers in their Sin­ga­pore of­fices. Close to 40 per cent are Sin­ga­pore-qual­i­fied lawyers.</p>
    <p>The QFLP li­cences al­low for­eign firms to prac­tise Sin­ga­pore law, ex­cept in some ar­eas such as crim­i­nal law and fam­ily law, through Sin­ga­pore-qual­i­fied lawyers or cer­ti­fied for­eign lawyers.</p>
    <p>In 2018/2019, the QFLPs gen­er­ated over $450 mil­lion in rev­enue, of which 80 per cent came from off­shore work that might other­wise have been done else­where, said a Law Min­istry spokesman.</p>
    <p>“This pro­vided Sin­ga­porean lawyers work­ing with those firms valu­able op­por­tu­ni­ties to gain new ex­pe­ri­ences and broaden their skillsets,” she added.</p>
    <p>There are about 130 for­eign law prac­tice en­ti­ties, in­clud­ing the QFLPs, and about 1,200 for­eign­qual­i­fied lawyers, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans with over­seas law qual­i­fi­ca­tions, based here, she said.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, there were 912 lo­cal law firms and 5,920 prac­tis­ing Sin­ga­pore lawyers as of Aug 31 last year, Law So­ci­ety data shows.</p>
    <p>The Law Min­istry said the di­ver­sity and qual­ity of the le­gal sec­tor is a key con­trib­u­tor to Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as an in­ter­na­tional le­gal hub, and also sup­ports the di­verse le­gal needs of the many multi­na­tional com­pa­nies based here.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers note that the per­ceived glass ceil­ing for Sin­ga­porean lawyers in in­ter­na­tional firms in the past has been re­placed in re­cent years by a push to de­velop such lawyers in lead­er­ship roles.</p>
    <p>“The QFLP and var­i­ous lo­cal-in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tions have cer­tainly helped shaped this – by the work that is be­ing at­tracted and the train­ing op­tions that are now avail­able to Sin­ga­pore lawyers in in­ter­na­tional firms,” said global le­gal tal­ent head-hunter Ashish Raivadera.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional firms are not nec­es­sar­ily bet­ter than lo­cal firms but they pro­vide a com­ple­men­tary ser­vice and do at­tract global busi­ness, he said.</p>
    <p>Based here, Mr Ashish, who is man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Ma­jor, Lyn­d­sey and Africa, a global le­gal re­cruit­ment spe­cial­ist head­quar­tered in the United States, added: “There are def­i­nitely more Sin­ga­pore­ans in in­ter­na­tional law firms now than there were 10 years ago. In some firms I would sug­gest that this has moved to over 50 per cent of the co­hort, or more. And at ev­ery level.”</p>
    <p>He said: “There is a pos­i­tive ef­fort on the part of most firms to hire and pro­mote the best Sin­ga­pore tal­ent they can find. This is par­tic­u­larly preva­lent at more ju­nior lev­els, where all the firms we work with are keen to hire the best Sin­ga­porean lawyers wher­ever pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The im­pe­tus ap­pears from the law firms them­selves as most firms are now try­ing to change the look and feel of their Sin­ga­pore or re­gional busi­ness to make them more Asia-rel­e­vant, among other things.</p>
    <p>This will lead to more Sin­ga­pore­ans in lead­er­ship roles lo­cally and glob­ally, he said, cit­ing ex­am­ples such as Mr Ong Yu-En, head of the Sin­ga­pore prac­tice of Nor­ton Rose Ful­bright; Mr Mil­ton Cheng, who has taken the reins at Baker McKen­zie; and Milbank part­ner Jacqueline Chan. Milbank is a top 100 global law firm head­quar­tered in New York, with more than 800 at­tor­neys in 12 of­fices across four con­ti­nents.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan said: “Be­ing part of an in­ter­na­tional law firm has al­lowed me the op­por­tu­nity to learn from the best of the best across the world, and to work on the most com­plex and high-pro­file of trans­ac­tions glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­porean lawyers progress in in­ter­na­tional firms, there are lo­cal firms that have linked up with in­ter­na­tional play­ers, such as Sin­ga­pore’s Den­tons Rodyk.</p>
    <p>“We see our­selves as a lo­cal Sin­ga­porean law firm with a global reach to our 184 Den­tons of­fices world­wide across 76 coun­tries, so we op­er­ate in a unique space,” said Den­tons Rodyk’s chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Loh Kia Meng.</p>
    <p>Den­tons Rodyk’s Ms Ng Sook Zhen, who heads the firm’s Ja­pan Desk in Sin­ga­pore, added: “We are for­tu­nate to have ben­e­fited from the ad­di­tional slice of ac­tion with the grow­ing le­gal pie.</p>
    <p>“The fact that our firm has a des­ig­nated Ja­pan Desk to ser­vice Ja­panese clients and law firms is tes­ta­ment to the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits we see in the growth of this sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore lawyers as­sume prom­i­nent roles in in­ter­na­tional law firms, the Sin­ga­pore Academy of Law (SAL) has also stepped in to help Sin­ga­porean law grad­u­ates seek­ing pupil­lage place­ments in London firms as a gate­way to com­pete among the best.</p>
    <p>SAL’s For­eign Lawyers Chap­ter, chaired by London-based Queen’s Coun­sel (QC) Ng Jern-Fei, has spear­headed the project, aimed at pro­vid­ing a sup­port net­work for Sin­ga­pore lawyers ap­ply­ing for English pupil­lage and in de­vel­op­ing their ca­reers at the English Bar. This in­cludes sem­i­nars, dis­cus­sion groups and in­ter­view train­ing.</p>
    <p>“That there is an in­creas­ing body of Sin­ga­pore­ans at the English Bar is tes­ta­ment to Sin­ga­pore’s grow­ing role as a cen­tre of le­gal ex­cel­lence and as a source of le­gal tal­ent who are able to go toe-to-toe with the creme de la creme in what is one of the most com­pet­i­tive and de­vel­oped le­gal ser­vices mar­kets in the world.”</p>
    <p>Like prize-win­ning Ox­ford law grad­u­ate Nathalie Koh, 25, who said: “I thought London was the best place to start my le­gal ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>QC Ng said: “The Sin­ga­pore­ans at the English Bar also serve as global am­bas­sadors for Sin­ga­pore law and dis­pute res­o­lu­tion of­fer­ings.”</p>
