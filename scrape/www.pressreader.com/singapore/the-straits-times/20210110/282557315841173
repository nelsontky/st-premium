    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ment mis­take?</p>
    <p>A I lost about £20,000 on a few cases of in­vest­ment-grade Mou­ton Roth­schild red wines in 2011.</p>
    <p>I got to know about the op­por­tu­nity through a cold call, at a time when I was ex­plor­ing wine in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>I did not do much re­search then, but the sales­man was a smooth talker and, in hind­sight, it was too good to be true.</p>
    <p>It turned out to be a scam and the wines were fake. I found out about it in 2014, af­ter news of the sham broke and the com­pany was liq­ui­dated.</p>
    <p>It was a good re­minder for me to do more due dili­gence when mak­ing such in­vest­ments, and I later went back to wine in­vest­ments around 2015 or 2016.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A I in­vested in a 1,000 sq ft prop­erty in Lon­don, in the Ca­nary Wharf area where I worked, which is the sec­ondary Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict of the city.</p>
    <p>I bought it dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2009, at a price that was more than 20 per cent lower than the pre­vi­ous trans­acted price just two years ear­lier.</p>
    <p>My in­ter­nal rate of re­turn on that prop­erty when I sold it at the end of 2011 was more than 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>But I be­lieve the best in­vest­ment that can be made is in your­self – con­tin­u­ously learn, be cu­ri­ous, up­grade and learn some­thing new ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>I some­times de­lib­er­ately step out of my com­fort zone to learn some­thing new. I think it’s im­por­tant to learn from fail­ures, mis­steps and losses.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, the more ex­pen­sive a mis­take, the greater the in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>I also be­lieve in in­vest­ing in re­la­tion­ships, nur­tur­ing and build­ing bridges. Those who are gen­er­ous and help­ful reap the most.</p>
