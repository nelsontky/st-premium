    <p>NAYPYITAW • Myan­mar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi is un­der pres­sure to de­lay the Novem­ber gen­eral elec­tion as a resur­gence in coro­n­avirus cases has re­sulted in a strict lock­down across parts of the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion par­ties led by the military-backed Union Sol­i­dar­ity and Devel­op­ment Party wrote to the Union Elec­tion Com­mis­sion this week to de­mand the Nov 8 polls be post­poned be­cause of a jump in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion is con­cerned that cam­paign ral­lies and other ac­tiv­i­ties may fuel more in­fec­tions and many el­i­gi­ble vot­ers may not be able to cast their bal­lots.</p>
    <p>“We have wit­nessed that sup­port­ers of re­spec­tive par­ties un­con­sciously fail to fol­low so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures in elec­tion cam­paigns,” about two dozen op­po­si­tion par­ties said in the let­ter. “We fore­see un­ex­pected mass gath­er­ings due to sup­port­ers’ en­thu­si­asm.”</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) still favours go­ing to vote on sched­ule, with Ms Suu Kyi say­ing the out­break can be con­tained with strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond wave of virus in­fec­tions hit the na­tion of 54 mil­lion peo­ple last month, forc­ing the au­thor­i­ties to bring back stay-home or­ders in com­mer­cial hub Yan­gon and Rakhine state, and ban do­mes­tic travel na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>While the coun­try man­aged to keep to­tal in­fec­tions to about 400 un­til the mid­dle of last month, a sharp jump since then has re­sulted in 4,299 in­fec­tions and 61 deaths as at yes­ter­day, of­fi­cial data shows.</p>
    <p>The NLD, seen as the front run­ner, has said a de­lay in hold­ing the vote can lead to po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity as the Con­sti­tu­tion does not per­mit a de­lay of more than two months.</p>
    <p>The latest out­break can be con­trolled in the next few weeks to al­low for vot­ing in Novem­ber, said Mr Myo Nyunt, a mem­ber of the party’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“Myan­mar has tight­ened the rules and im­posed par­tial lock­down on the town­ships where the virus was de­tected the most,” Mr Myo Nyunt said. “This will re­sult in con­tain­ment of the virus spread in the next few weeks.”</p>
    <p>The near-shut­down of Myan­mar’s Yan­gon re­gion and Rakhine state, as well as lower elec­tion spend­ing amid so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, threat­ens the im­pov­er­ished coun­try’s fore­cast for eco­nomic re­cov­ery next year.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence in cases “spells more trou­ble for the Myan­mar econ­omy over the com­ing months with eco­nomic weak­ness likely to per­sist into 2021”, Fitch So­lu­tions said in a re­port this week.</p>
