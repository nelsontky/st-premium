    <p>LONDON • London’s Royal Opera House plans to sell a 1970s paint­ing by David Hock­ney as it seeks to raise cash to get through the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the worst cri­sis in its his­tory.</p>
    <p>Hock­ney’s Por­trait Of David Web­ster will be put up for auc­tion at Christie’s on Oct 22. It is es­ti­mated to be worth be­tween £11 mil­lion (S$19 mil­lion) and £18 mil­lion, the auc­tion house said.</p>
    <p>“As we face the big­gest cri­sis in our his­tory, the sale of David Hock­ney’s won­der­ful por­trait of Sir David Web­ster is a vi­tal part of our strat­egy for re­cov­ery,” said Mr Alex Beard, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Royal Opera House, in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The pro­ceeds will be used to en­sure that the world’s great­est artists can once more re­turn to our stages.”</p>
    <p>In com­mon with other cul­tural venues across Bri­tain and the world, the Royal Opera House was forced to shut in March as the first wave of the Covid-19 out­break gath­ered pace, and has been un­able to gen­er­ate rev­enue since.</p>
    <p>Christie’s de­scribed the por­trait by 83-year-old Hock­ney, con­sid­ered one of the gi­ants of Bri­tish art in the 20th and 21st cen­turies, as “an ex­tra­or­di­nary paint­ing that per­fectly cap­tures the artist’s mas­tery of paint and flair for colour”.</p>
    <p>“The stag­ing of this paint­ing feels al­most the­atri­cal, which is of course a fit­ting trib­ute,” said Ms Katharine Arnold, the auc­tion house’s co-head, Post-War and Con­tem­po­rary Art Europe.</p>
    <p>Mr Web­ster, the paint­ing’s sub­ject, ran the Royal Opera House from 1945 to 1970. Ms Arnold de­scribed him as a vi­sion­ary leader who helped to make the in­sti­tu­tion world class.</p>
    <p>Mr Beard said the sale was part of the opera house’s four-pronged pan­demic re­cov­ery plan, which in­cluded cost-cut­ting mea­sures, fund-rais­ing from au­di­ences, seek­ing gov­ern­ment sup­port and re­al­is­ing value from as­sets.</p>
    <p>He said the plan would al­low the opera house to “sus­tain our com­mu­nity of artists through this pe­riod, and to en­sure we can con­tinue to de­light au­di­ences for decades to come with ex­tra­or­di­nary bal­let, dance, mu­sic and opera”.</p>
