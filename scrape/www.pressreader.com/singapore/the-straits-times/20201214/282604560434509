    <p>LON­DON • Frank Lam­pard rub­bished his side’s chances of win­ning the Pre­mier League this sea­son af­ter miss­ing out on the chance to move back to top of the ta­ble with a 1-0 de­feat by Ever­ton in front of 2,000 fans at Goodison Park on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>A run of 17 games with­out de­feat in all com­pe­ti­tions af­ter splash­ing £220 mil­lion (S$389 mil­lion) in the sum­mer had seen Chelsea talked up as se­ri­ous ti­tle con­tenders.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Lam­pard claimed his side still had to be con­sid­ered young pre­tenders af­ter they failed to muster a re­sponse to Gylfi Sig­urds­son’s 22nd-minute penalty af­ter Do­minic Calvert-Lewin was brought down by Edouard Mendy, his sec­ond mis­take in two games.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple who are say­ing, ‘We’re go­ing to win the league, we’ve got the best squad in the league’, it’s ridicu­lous stuff,” said the Blues boss. “When you talk about the best squads, you have to look at the teams that have won it in the last two, three or four years.</p>
    <p>“Their squads are full of strik­ers and wingers that score 30 or 40 goals a sea­son, mid­field play­ers that have won mul­ti­ple league ti­tles all over the place.</p>
    <p>“We have some but we have young play­ers and as a squad, we’re not there. It’s very quickly gone from we were nowhere near good enough af­ter the games against West Brom and Southamp­ton to we are ti­tle favourites.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have to work through nights like tonight. It was a big test for us, we didn’t pass that test but we will in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Lam­pard also blamed the lack of width usu­ally pro­vided by in­jured wingers Chris­tian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech, leav­ing the vis­i­tors short on cre­ativ­ity with just 10 at­tempts on goal.</p>
    <p>“There are mus­cle in­juries all over,” he said. “Play­ers who are ex­plo­sive and at the top end of the pitch are get­ting in­jured. Did we miss our wide play­ers? Yes, we did be­cause they’re im­por­tant for us.”</p>
    <p>There will be a third at­tempt to push for the in­tro­duc­tion of five sub­sti­tutes on Thurs­day and Lam­pard hopes “player wel­fare” will sway the clubs who are op­pos­ing the change on the ba­sis it ben­e­fits those with deeper squads.</p>
    <p>Chelsea were rat­tled here last sea­son, los­ing 3-1, and that was the case again as Ever­ton fed off the at­mos­phere cre­ated by their sup­port­ers for the first time since March to ar­rest a slide of just one win in their pre­vi­ous seven games.</p>
    <p>“There were only 2,000 (fans) but we are re­ally happy for them. They have seen a good match from Ever­ton, we played well with a fan­tas­tic spirit,” said Tof­fees boss Carlo Ancelotti, whose side also recorded their first clean sheet in 13 games.</p>
    <p>“The im­pact was re­ally strong. It is re­ally im­por­tant to have the sup­port­ers, it is a to­tally dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­ment here com­pletely.”</p>
