    <p>Power plays within Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s (be­low) coali­tion are en­cum­ber­ing its bid in a cru­cial state elec­tion in Sabah to­day. His Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah has strug­gled to pre­vent elec­toral clashes among its own mem­bers, ef­fec­tively hand­ing the ad­van­tage to the fed­eral op­po­si­tion-aligned Warisan Plus coali­tion led by care­taker Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal. WORLD</p>
    <p>Power plays within Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s coali­tion con­tinue to en­cum­ber its bid in a cru­cial state elec­tion in Sabah, which is tak­ing place to­day amid fresh ques­tions over his ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah (GRS) – com­pris­ing Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, Barisan Na­sional (BN) and Parti Ber­satu Sabah – has strug­gled to pre­vent elec­toral clashes among its own mem­bers.</p>
    <p>This has ef­fec­tively handed the ad­van­tage to the fed­eral op­po­si­tion-aligned Warisan Plus coali­tion led by care­taker Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal, who has been touted as a pos­si­ble prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date for the Malaysian op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has hinted at the pos­si­bil­ity of hold­ing snap elec­tions soon should his GRS coali­tion win in Sabah, where 447 can­di­dates are vy­ing for 73 state assem­bly seats.</p>
    <p>But his coali­tion part­ners, who banded to­gether only a day be­fore the Sept 12 Nom­i­na­tion Day, are con­test­ing against one an­other in 17 of the seats – al­most a quar­ter of the to­tal. There has also been un­cer­tainty over who will be the coali­tion’s chief min­is­ter should they win power.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din had en­dorsed the Sabah chief of his own party, Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (PPBM), Ha­jiji Noor, to be the chief min­is­ter in the event of a vic­tory. How­ever, Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said the de­ci­sion on the ap­point­ment will be made af­ter the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ah­mad Zahid did not show up for a grand fi­nale GRS rally on the out­skirts of Kota Kin­a­balu on Thurs­day, the day af­ter he cast doubts over Mr Muhyid­din’s ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment when he said that some Umno MPs are back­ing op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim to be­come the next PM. Umno is cur­rently the big­gest party in the PN gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the Warisan Plus coali­tion has suc­cess­fully man­aged to avoid in­fight­ing, and in­cum­bent Datuk Seri Shafie’s face has been plas­tered all over the state in a clear in­di­ca­tion of a single chief min­is­te­rial can­di­date should they win the polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie’s cam­paign mes­sage is also find­ing trac­tion. He has cam­paigned on the mes­sage of in­clu­siv­ity – stress­ing on the mul­ti­cul­tural and multi-re­li­gious as­pect of life in Sabah, and preach­ing unity among races.</p>
    <p>His mes­sage con­trasts with the po­larised pol­i­tics of Penin­su­lar Malaysia, with the fed­eral gov­ern­ment be­ing formed largely by par­ties based on race and reli­gion.</p>
    <p>All Warisan Plus com­po­nents – Warisan, United Pro­gres­sive Kin­a­balu Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Upko), Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) and Parti Amanah Ne­gara (Amanah) – are mul­tira­cial par­ties.</p>
    <p>“Shafie’s unity mes­sage res­onates well,” said Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs se­nior fel­low Oh Ei Sun, who is also a Sabah na­tive.</p>
    <p>“Warisan does have the edge as the other side (GRS) is dis­or­gan­ised and some­what go­ing at each other,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>While a Warisan vic­tory is ex­pected to em­bolden the fed­eral op­po­si­tion’s at­tempts to re­tain power, it will also slow Umno’s push for snap elec­tions, the an­a­lyst said.</p>
    <p>A GRS win also does not nec­es­sar­ily mean good news for Mr Muhyid­din, Dr Oh said, point­ing out that it de­pends on the share of seats won by his party ver­sus Umno.</p>
    <p>“A GRS win, with Umno vastly out­num­ber­ing Ber­satu in seats, would be a night­mare for Muhyid­din, as Umno would re­dou­ble ef­forts to push for elec­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>This elec­tion is the first time Mr Muy­hid­din’s party is con­test­ing in Sabah. It stayed out of Sabah dur­ing the 2018 elec­tions, when it was aligned with Warisan, and its Sabah chap­ter was formed af­ter the elec­tions. All of PPBM’s as­sem­bly­men in Sabah were elected on an Umno ticket.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie, on the other hand, has wasted no time in en­gag­ing with Saba­hans of dif­fer­ent age groups, and has man­aged to con­vince al­lies such as DAP and Amanah to con­test the elec­tion un­der his party’s logo – re­in­forc­ing the mes­sage of unity.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie has been touted as a PM can­di­date for the fed­eral op­po­si­tion, with the back­ing of twotime premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad. While Datuk Seri An­war claimed to have a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity this week, Mr Shafie has not said if his party’s nine MPs are also back­ing the PKR pres­i­dent for pre­mier­ship.</p>
    <p>Warisan has not of­fi­cially joined any fed­eral al­liance, en­abling it to con­tinue be­ing a Sabah-based party for Saba­hans, free of di­rect Penin­su­lar in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Its sur­prise win in the 2018 elec­tions and abil­ity to form the state gov­ern­ment changed the land­scape of Bor­neo pol­i­tics – lead­ing to more par­ties in Sabah and Sarawak be­com­ing more state-cen­tric and de­tached from fed­eral al­liances.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing par­ties of neigh­bour­ing Sarawak left BN fol­low­ing the 2018 elec­tions, and formed their own al­liance called Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak (GPS).</p>
    <p>GPS backs the cur­rent PN gov­ern­ment but has not for­mally joined the coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Sabah has over a mil­lion reg­is­tered vot­ers el­i­gi­ble to take part in this elec­tion. The Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Min­istry is tar­get­ing a 70 per cent voter turnout.</p>
