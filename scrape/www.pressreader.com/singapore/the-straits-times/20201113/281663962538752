    <p>Viruses that orig­i­nate in an­i­mal hosts be­fore spread­ing to hu­mans are not new, but sci­en­tists have never pre­vi­ously had to con­tend with the re­verse, said in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Wang Linfa yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said one of the more wor­ry­ing char­ac­ter­is­tics of the Sars-CoV-2 virus re­spon­si­ble for Covid-19 is that it can spread from hu­mans back to an­i­mal hosts – a process known as spill­back – and then to hu­mans again.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on the first day of a two­day vir­tual Covid-19 sem­i­nar on the theme “Dis­sect­ing the dis­ease and its ef­fects”, Pro­fes­sor Wang said there is no doubt Sars-CoV-2 orig­i­nated in an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>“While we have not found a virus iden­ti­cal to Sars-CoV-2 in an­i­mals, we know that re­lated viruses can in­fect bats and pan­golins in their nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment,” said Prof Wang, who is the direc­tor of the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School. “But we now have dis­cov­ered this spill­back – hu­mans have given the virus to cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks.”</p>
    <p>Prof Wang noted that cases of farmed minks car­ry­ing mu­tated forms of the virus have been de­tected in the Nether­lands and, more re­cently, Den­mark, which trig­gered mass culling of the an­i­mal bred for its fur.</p>
    <p>In­fected minks have also re­port­edly passed the virus back to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>“This is very scary, but it’s not the worst case be­cause we are still deal­ing with farmed an­i­mals. As long as the gov­ern­ment has the po­lit­i­cal will and re­sources, we can con­trol it by slaugh­ter­ing or quarantini­ng the an­i­mals,” Prof Wang said.</p>
    <p>What is more wor­ry­ing, he said, is the pos­si­bil­ity of other wildlife be­com­ing hosts for the virus, which will then likely mu­tate and cre­ate new vari­ants. “From Sars-CoV-2, we will have Sars-CoV-3, 4, 5... and that can spill over to other an­i­mals and come back to hu­mans. This is a real threat and we se­ri­ously need to think about this,” Prof Wang said.</p>
    <p>Nearly a year on since the first case of Covid-19 was re­ported in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan, the ques­tion of ex­actly how the pan­demic started and where the virus came from has gone unan­swered, noted Prof Wang.</p>
    <p>The is­sue has be­come hotly politi­cised as ten­sions be­tween the United States and China in­ten­si­fied in the last few months, but ex­perts seek­ing the an­swer must look be­yond China, he said.</p>
    <p>He cited sim­i­lar com­ments from other world ex­perts, in­clud­ing two Bri­tons: Dr Peter Daszak, head of the global health non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion EcoHealth Al­liance, and Dr</p>
    <p>Jeremy Farrar, direc­tor of med­i­cal re­search char­ity Well­come Trust.</p>
    <p>Prof Wang noted the clos­est ge­netic rel­a­tive of the virus re­spon­si­ble for Covid-19 in hu­mans was found in bat hosts in Yun­nan prov­ince, close to China’s south­ern bor­ders with Myan­mar, Laos and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>As South-east Asia has a higher ge­netic di­ver­sity of bats than China, sci­en­tists have a bet­ter chance of find­ing the ori­gin of Covid-19 out­side China, he added.</p>
    <p>Other ex­perts on the panel in­cluded Pro­fes­sor Kishore Mah­bubani, a dis­tin­guished fel­low at the Asia Re­search In­sti­tute in the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore; Pro­fes­sor Lisa Ng, a se­nior prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor at the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search; and As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor David Lye, direc­tor of in­fec­tious dis­ease re­search at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Prof Mah­bubani noted that coun­tries that have done bet­ter in han­dling Covid-19 gen­er­ally prized col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity over in­di­vid­ual rights and free­doms.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries with a his­tory of “fis­cal ir­re­spon­si­bil­ity” have also fared more poorly com­pared with coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore which have been “sav­ing for a rainy day” for decades, he added.</p>
    <p>He also sin­gled out the US gov­ern­ment for its de­ci­sion to ac­cel­er­ate its geopo­lit­i­cal con­test with China dur­ing the pan­demic. This was a “com­plete mis­take” that went against com­mon sense, he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the sem­i­nar, Prof Ng and Prof Lye gave de­tailed tech­ni­cal over­views of re­cent sci­en­tific re­search on Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While we have not found a virus iden­ti­cal to Sars-CoV-2 in an­i­mals, we know that re­lated viruses can in­fect bats and pan­golins in their nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment... But we now have dis­cov­ered this spill­back – hu­mans have given the virus to cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks.</p>
