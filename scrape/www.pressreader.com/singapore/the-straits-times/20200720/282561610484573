    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>I’ve al­ways played sports since I was young and it has be­come a habit for me to be ac­tive.</p>
    <p>I am not too fo­cused on the way I look, but con­stantly mov­ing or go­ing to the gym to con­di­tion my­self for the sports I play has al­lowed me to keep in shape.</p>
    <p>Were you ever not fit and fab?</p>
    <p>The drink­ing, the late nights and hav­ing to sit at a desk through­out the day when I had a cor­po­rate job was one such pe­riod. I did not look bad, but I didn’t feel my best.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>My break­fast tends to be pretty sim­ple – peanut but­ter on toast with a cup of cof­fee.</p>
    <p>For lunch, I gen­er­ally have pro­tein such as saba fish or stir-fried beef with rice, and for din­ner, I like hav­ing pasta with pesto or a sim­ple aglio olio.</p>
    <p>I am not re­stric­tive with my diet but I lis­ten to my body and know when I am full. And I don’t have the habit of snack­ing.</p>
    <p>What are your in­dul­gences?</p>
    <p>Burg­ers, pizza and pasta.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>I make time to take lit­tle ad­ven­tures in the week such as a week­end drive in my De­fender to Malaysia to surf.</p>
    <p>Some­times my friends and I head to East Coast Park with our cars, have good con­ver­sa­tion and en­joy the breeze by the coast.</p>
    <p>What are the three most im­por­tant things in your life?</p>
    <p>My loved ones, men­tal health and sports.</p>
    <p>What’s your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>My favourite part of my body is my hands, specif­i­cally the cal­luses that show the work I have put in over time.</p>
    <p>My least favourite part is my fin­ger­nails or lack of, due to an un­healthy nail-bit­ing habit.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and after a work­out?</p>
    <p>Mu­sic is es­sen­tial for mo­ti­va­tion and get­ting in the zone prior. I like to ban­ter with my friends after a hard work­out to­gether.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant is it for you to keep up with your fit­ness rou­tine?</p>
    <p>It is im­mensely im­por­tant as it not only helps me keep fit phys­i­cally, but it also aids with my men­tal health.</p>
    <p>How are you keep­ing fit dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>I have equip­ment at home and my girl­friend mo­ti­vates me to work out ev­ery day. A good rou­tine and hav­ing a work­out buddy helps us stay sane.</p>
    <p>What are the changes you have made to keep ex­er­cis­ing dur­ing this time?</p>
    <p>Since the fit­ness cor­ners have been closed off, I have been us­ing gym­nas­tic rings a lit­tle more and work­ing on my hand­stands at home.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive life­style in­flu­enced your fam­ily and friends?</p>
    <p>I’ve started cy­cling with my fam­ily mem­bers and also in­tro­duced cal­is­then­ics (re­sis­tance train­ing ex­er­cises that use one’s own body weight) to my friends.</p>
    <p>Some of them have been us­ing it in their fit­ness regime.</p>
    <p>What’s the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fit­ness?</p>
    <p>I got el­bowed in the nose dur­ing a foot­ball match when I was in sec­ondary school. I stuffed some tis­sues in my nose and kept play­ing.</p>
    <p>After the match, I went to the doc­tor to check if it was bro­ken, but thank­fully it was okay and I left it to heal for a week or so.</p>
    <p>How ex­ten­sive is your col­lec­tion of sports-re­lated para­pher­na­lia?</p>
    <p>I’m a Manch­ester United fan and have some fig­urines, jer­seys and sig­nage. Noth­ing too ex­ten­sive.</p>
    <p>Would you go for plas­tic surgery?</p>
    <p>No – I am pretty com­fort­able in my own skin. I am not com­pletely against it. If it’s some­thing that gives you con­fi­dence, then I’d say go for it.</p>
    <p>Do you think you’re sexy?</p>
    <p>I think what is more im­por­tant is how you feel on the in­side rather than how you look on the out­side. 30</p>
    <p>The first sport Mr Seow picked up was foot­ball, when he was 10. He was slightly over­weight in pri­mary school and de­cided to join the sport as a CCA to be ac­tive.</p>
    <p>He en­joyed the beau­ti­ful game and con­tin­ued with it through sec­ondary school to adult­hood, play­ing with his friends oc­ca­sion­ally on the week­end.</p>
    <p>When he went to Republic Poly­tech­nic, he de­cided to try an­other team sport – dragon boat­ing. “It was tough as train­ing was six times a week, but it taught me a lot about team­work and per­se­ver­ance. We won many medals as a team and I was proud of those sport­ing achieve­ments,” said Mr Seow.</p>
    <p>After earn­ing a diploma in new me­dia, he got a busi­ness mar­ket­ing de­gree at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment and in 2014 went into mar­ket­ing in the ho­tel in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Then, he “took a leap of faith into the fit­ness in­dus­try” to be­come a per­sonal trainer about 2 1/ years</p>
    <p>2 ago.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways had a pas­sion for sports and fit­ness, so I de­cided to leave my cor­po­rate ca­reer to pur­sue it while I am still young. To me, fit­ness isn’t just about work­ing out phys­i­cally. It has helped me sub­stan­tially with my men­tal health and I wanted to im­part that to oth­ers too,” said Mr Seow.</p>
    <p>While watch­ing some YouTube videos some time ago, he chanced upon cal­is­then­ics – strength­train­ing that uses one’s own body weight as re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>“I was mes­merised by what we can do and build with mere body weight ex­er­cises. Cal­is­then­ics al­lows me to un­der­stand my body bet­ter and pushes the bound­aries of my men­tal and phys­i­cal states. I also en­joy the pain in the bar­baric en­durance sets on some days and the jour­ney of learn­ing new skills on other days.”</p>
    <p>Last year, he started Com­mon­ground with two friends, Mr Zachary Lee and Mr Wensen</p>
    <p>Fit­ness rou­tine</p>
    <p>Teh. Com­mon­ground brings peo­ple of all fit­ness lev­els and abil­i­ties to­gether through an out­door-based work­out which in­volves cal­is­then­ics and func­tional train­ing.</p>
    <p>“The ac­ces­si­bil­ity of the sport is just an­other amaz­ing thing about cal­is­then­ics. It brings peo­ple to­gether at the pub­lic parks where it is com­mon ground,” said Mr Seow.</p>
