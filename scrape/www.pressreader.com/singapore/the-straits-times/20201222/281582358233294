    <p>In­di­vid­u­als and groups across the is­land looked to the skies last night to wit­ness what ap­peared to be a sin­gle in­tense point of light, but was ac­tu­ally a kiss of two plan­ets – Saturn and Jupiter, which came the clos­est they have been to each other in cen­turies.</p>
    <p>The event, also known as the Great Con­junc­tion or Christ­mas Star, fell coin­ci­den­tally on the win­ter sol­stice, the long­est night of the year in the north­ern hemi­sphere.</p>
    <p>The two plan­ets have been inch­ing closer to each other over the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, the last time they were this close, and vis­i­ble, was in the pre-dawn sky on March 4, 1226, at the height of Genghis Khan’s Mon­gol Em­pire.</p>
    <p>But while they looked so close to each other as if they would touch, the gas gi­ants were ac­tu­ally more than 730 mil­lion km apart.</p>
    <p>The US Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa) said the plan­ets reg­u­larly ap­pear to pass each other in the so­lar sys­tem, with the po­si­tions of Jupiter and Saturn be­ing aligned in the sky about once ev­ery 20 years.</p>
    <p>What makes this year’s spec­ta­cle so rare, how­ever, is that it has been nearly 400 years since the plan­ets passed this close to each other in the sky, and nearly 800 years since the align­ment of Saturn and Jupiter oc­curred at night, al­low­ing</p>
    <p>nearly ev­ery­one around the world to wit­ness it, Nasa noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Sa­ja­han, 31, a cy­ber-se­cu­rity an­a­lyst, and his wife Thahira Thas­nim, 27, a school coun­sel­lor, gath­ered with friends in Ang Mo Kio to watch the ce­les­tial con­junc­tion, af­ter learn­ing about the event from a friend, as­tron­omy en­thu­si­ast A. Kan­nan.</p>
    <p>Mr Sa­ja­han said: “Kan­nan told me that the con­junc­tion was to­day, and that it could be seen in the south-west sky. I thought it would be per­fect to view it from my flat.”</p>
    <p>Although the skies were cloudy and they were un­able to spot the plan­ets, they were glad to en­joy the night and be part of the as­tro­nom­i­cal event.</p>
    <p>In Wood­lands, Mr Kan­nan, 56, a man­ager at a statu­tory board, had more luck.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the sky be­ing over­cast, Jupiter was still bright enough to be spot­ted, though it was fain­ter than on clearer days,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The plan­ets were vis­i­ble for a</p>
    <p>full 45 min­utes to the naked eye.”</p>
    <p>Else­where on the is­land, the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion’s As­tron­omy Club man­aged to ob­tain pho­tos of the con­junc­tion, said Mr Des­mond Lim, a lec­turer at the school.</p>
    <p>“The stu­dents were ex­cited when they saw the con­junc­tion through the tele­scope as it is such a rare op­por­tu­nity to be able to view two plan­ets through the same field of vi­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers tuned into Sci­ence Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore’s live stream of the event last night.</p>
    <p>The plan­ets will still be vis­i­ble for the next few days, although they will not be as close to each other.</p>
    <p>While they can be seen un­aided, binoc­u­lars will show a clearer gap be­tween them.</p>
    <p>And with a tele­scope, stargaz­ers could pos­si­bly spot the two plan­ets, their largest moons, and even Saturn’s rings.</p>
