    <p>The Court of Ap­peal yes­ter­day gave the green light for Sin­ga­porean heroin traf­ficker Syed Suhail Syed Zin, 44, to ar­gue his case that death-row in­mates are not be­ing treated equally in the sched­ul­ing of ex­e­cu­tions.</p>
    <p>Suhail is seek­ing a ju­di­cial review of the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice’s (SPS) de­ci­sion to carry out his death sen­tence be­fore that of oth­ers who were con­victed be­fore him. He con­tends that is a vi­o­la­tion of his right to equal­ity un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The apex court’s de­ci­sion to grant per­mis­sion for ju­di­cial review came af­ter Suhail’s lawyer, Mr M. Ravi, cited Malaysian drug traf­ficker Datchi­na­murthy Kata­iah as an ex­am­ple. Datchi­na­murthy was given the death sen­tence be­fore Suhail in 2015 but Suhail was sched­uled to be hanged be­fore Datchi­na­murthy.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi also pointed out that Datchi­na­murthy’s in­mate num­ber is 944, while Suhail’s is 949, to sup­port his case about the se­quence in which they were put on death row.</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, giv­ing the de­ci­sion of the three­judge apex court, said that on the face of it, there is an in­con­sis­tency be­tween the known facts and an as­ser­tion con­tained in an af­fi­davit sub­mit­ted to the court by the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA).</p>
    <p>Based on this in­con­sis­tency, the thresh­old to grant per­mis­sion for ju­di­cial review has been crossed, he said.</p>
    <p>The af­fi­davit states that “when the 18 Sep­tem­ber 2020 date was sched­uled for the ex­e­cu­tion of the ap­pel­lant’s sen­tence, the ap­pel­lant was the ear­li­est to have been sen­tenced to death among all of­fend­ers in the same po­si­tion as he was at the point of sched­ul­ing”.</p>
    <p>The court did not al­low a bid by Se­nior Coun­sel Fran­cis Ng from the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers to sub­mit fur­ther ev­i­dence, at this stage, to ex­plain the cir­cum­stances of Datchi­na­murthy’s case.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said the MHA af­fi­davit had been pre­pared to ad­dress ques­tions raised by the apex court at the pre­vi­ous hear­ing on Sept 22. “We apol­o­gise if we un­der­stood the ques­tions wrongly; we read them as re­fer­ring to gen­eral terms,” he said.</p>
    <p>The court, which also com­prised Judges of Ap­peal An­drew Phang and Ju­dith Prakash, gave di­rec­tions for the mat­ter to be dealt with in the High Court ex­pe­di­tiously.</p>
    <p>Suhail was sen­tenced to death by the High Court on Dec 2, 2015, for traf­fick­ing 38.84g of heroin.</p>
    <p>His ap­peal was dis­missed on Oct 18, 2018. On July 5 last year, Suhail was told that his pe­ti­tion for clemency had been re­jected. On Sept 11 this year, he was told that he would be hanged on Sept 18.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi ap­plied for per­mis­sion from the court for ju­di­cial review of the SPS de­ci­sion on the sched­ul­ing of his ex­e­cu­tion. The ap­pli­ca­tion was dis­missed by the High Court on Sept 17 but Suhail’s ex­e­cu­tion was stayed pend­ing the ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Chief Jus­tice said he ac­cepted that the State has a mea­sure of flex­i­bil­ity in sched­ul­ing ex­e­cu­tions, which he noted can­not be ef­fected in a way that is “en­tirely math­e­mat­i­cal”. But he said that flex­i­bil­ity has to be ex­er­cised in a way that is ra­tio­nal and fair.</p>
