    <p>Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home had to deal with two Covid-19 in­ci­dents this year, but the first ex­pe­ri­ence was starkly dif­fer­ent from the sec­ond one.</p>
    <p>In March, it be­came the first nurs­ing home to re­port a coro­n­avirus case at its branch off Thomson Road. At the peak of the cri­sis, there were 14 res­i­dents in­fected, and four of them later died.</p>
    <p>The home’s ad­min­is­tra­tor, Mr Then Kim Yuan, who was work­ing from home at the time, said that with all staff and res­i­dents quar­an­tined, it was a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion to man­age.</p>
    <p>Then in Au­gust, a for­mer staff mem­ber tested pos­i­tive af­ter re­turn­ing home to the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Al­though the per­son was asymp­to­matic, 90 staff and res­i­dents at the home’s Si­lat branch – where the per­son had worked – were swabbed. No­body tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>This time, armed with the lessons learnt from March, the home’s pro­cesses were smoother, said Mr Then.</p>
    <p>When the first case was iden­ti­fied on March 31, he said, busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plans were thrown out the win­dow, as all staff were un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Then: “It was a whole new ex­pe­ri­ence for all of us. What­ever work­flow pro­cesses from our emer­gency pre­pared­ness ex­er­cises that we had pre­vi­ously for­mu­lated with the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC) could not work.</p>
    <p>“I had to iden­tify my pri­or­i­ties at that point – health and safety, ser­vice con­ti­nu­ity and stay­ing in touch with the res­i­dents’ fam­ily mem­bers.”</p>
    <p>He fielded hun­dreds of phone calls from anx­ious fam­ily mem­bers and worked round the clock to li­aise with the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the res­i­dent tested pos­i­tive, MOH and AIC rep­re­sen­ta­tives vis­ited the home and stayed un­til 4am. They were back again at 7am.</p>
    <p>It was a pe­riod of time that felt over­whelm­ing not just for the res­i­dents, but also the staff, who felt phys­i­cally and men­tally drained.</p>
    <p>In­fected res­i­dents were ad­mit­ted to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal and the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases, and the home had to deal with calls from the two health­care in­sti­tu­tions for the res­i­dents’ med­i­cal records and other in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>With hind­sight, Mr Then said, shared elec­tronic med­i­cal records would have helped, but the push to­wards dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion had taken a back seat af­ter the health­care sec­tor faced sev­eral cy­ber-at­tack in­ci­dents in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, when the for­mer worker tested pos­i­tive, the way things were han­dled was dif­fer­ent, said Mr Then. For in­stance, within two hours of no­ti­fy­ing the au­thor­i­ties, a con­fer­ence call was set up and in­struc­tions were given out.</p>
    <p>“The pro­ce­dures and pro­to­cols were so seam­less. It was dif­fer­ent from the March episode, where we had to find a way for­ward, try to fit the so­lu­tions and deal with things as they came along.”</p>
    <p>Mr Then said he found he could take a step back in Au­gust as his team was able to han­dle the in­ci­dent and put in mo­tion their re­vised busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plan.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the pan­demic, the home plans to ex­plore more dig­i­tal so­lu­tions, such as re­mote mon­i­tor­ing, which will be use­ful for res­i­dents with higher care needs.</p>
    <p>It is also merg­ing its vi­tal signs mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem with its elec­tronic med­i­cal records, which will im­prove ef­fi­ciency.</p>
