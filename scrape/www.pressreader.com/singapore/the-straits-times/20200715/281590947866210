    <p>The pan­demic has opened up more op­por­tu­ni­ties – and tac­ti­cal cover – for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to pur­sue its strate­gic agenda: curb­ing im­mi­gra­tion. And univer­sity stu­dents are only the lat­est tar­gets in that agenda, says US bureau chief Nir­mal Ghosh (be­low).</p>
    <p>It is al­most a tru­ism that the alchemy of mod­ern Amer­ica is in its im­mi­grants – wave af­ter wave from around the world.</p>
    <p>But the Don­ald Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been turn­ing off the flow one tap at a time. In this, the Pres­i­dent has been noth­ing but con­sis­tent.</p>
    <p>And the ef­fect, an­a­lysts con­tend, will be not just to di­min­ish the United States’ own tal­ent pool, but to erode the global ap­peal of Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The wall on the Mex­i­can bor­der is like the back­ground score to the agenda.</p>
    <p>Play­ing to the gallery in packed are­nas, can­di­date Trump touted it through­out his 2016 cam­paign, and last week­end he tweeted: “We have now built 240 miles of new bor­der wall on our southern bor­der. We will have over 450 miles built by the end of the year.”</p>
    <p>For good mea­sure, he reprised the tried-and-tested bo­gey­man, adding: “The rad­i­cal left Democrats want open bor­ders for any­one, in­clud­ing many crim­i­nals, to come in!”</p>
    <p>The agenda has been ad­vanced in var­i­ous ways. It started with cut­ting back on refugees and asy­lum seek­ers. Some of it was clothed in the lan­guage of fear – that Amer­ica has been ripped off by the rest of the world, and that im­mi­grants take jobs, or bring crime and dis­ease.</p>
    <p>An at­tempt to can­cel for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s “Dream­ers” pro­gramme, which al­lowed chil­dren of il­le­gal aliens to stay, was only days ago stalled by the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 COVER</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has opened up more op­por­tu­ni­ties – and tac­ti­cal cover – for the ad­min­is­tra­tion to pur­sue its strate­gic agenda: curb­ing im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Late last month, Mr Trump sus­pended a slew of visa cat­e­gories for for­eign work­ers, cit­ing the need to pro­tect Amer­i­cans in need of jobs in the Covid-19-in­duced down­turn.</p>
    <p>The move will keep out hun­dreds of thou­sands of for­eign­ers and will af­fect would-be man­ual labour­ers as well as soft­ware pro­gram­mers.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter, it was the turn of for­eign stu­dents to have the door shut in their faces – again with an as­sist from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Har­vard Univer­sity and the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy are chal­leng­ing the ex­ec­u­tive or­der that bans visas for for­eign stu­dents at­tend­ing US col­leges of­fer­ing only on­line classes.</p>
    <p>The law­suit is sup­ported by al­most 60 other uni­ver­si­ties, in­clud­ing Stan­ford and Duke, as well as US tech giants Mi­crosoft and Google, and the US Cham­ber of Com­merce.</p>
    <p>Dr Vic­tor Cha, se­nior ad­viser and Korea chair at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies think-tank in Wash­ing­ton, called the move “reck­less, xeno­pho­bic and heart­less”. Stu­dents from around the globe en­rich every sin­gle cam­pus in the US, he noted.</p>
    <p>His col­league, Dr Sue Mi Terry, a se­nior fel­low, tweeted: “When I was a grad stu­dent at (The Fletcher School of Law and Diplo­macy at Tufts Univer­sity) I was able to take classes such as Chi­nese pol­i­tics with stu­dents from Ti­bet, Tai­wan, main­land China, Ja­pan, Korea.</p>
    <p>“We were all en­riched by the dif­fer­ent perspectiv­es. The learn­ing wouldn’t be the same with­out them.”</p>
    <p>In a July 7 post, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chris Bronk from the Univer­sity of Hous­ton cau­tioned that “the mass re­moval of for­eign grad­u­ate stu­dents is at the very least a messy prob­lem. In Novem­ber 2019, there were 1,095,299 in­ter­na­tional stu­dents study­ing in the United States, about 5 per cent of the to­tal of all US col­lege stu­dents”.</p>
    <p>THE COST OF CLOS­ING DOORS</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional stu­dents in the US con­trib­uted nearly US$41 bil­lion (S$57.1 bil­lion) to the na­tional econ­omy in the 2018-2019 aca­demic year, ac­cord­ing to Nafsa: As­so­ci­a­tion of In­ter­na­tional Ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>What’s more, the ben­e­fits con­tinue be­yond their col­lege years. A 2018 study by the non-par­ti­san Na­tional Foun­da­tion for Amer­i­can Pol­icy found that more than half – 55 per cent – of US$1 bil­lion start-up com­pa­nies had at least one im­mi­grant founder.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica’s abil­ity to at­tract in­ter­na­tional stu­dents fos­ters en­trepreneur­ship,” Mr Stu­art An­der­son, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the foun­da­tion, wrote at the time.</p>
    <p>“About 23 per cent (21 of 91) of the bil­lion-dol­lar start-up com­pa­nies had a founder who first came to Amer­ica as an in­ter­na­tional stu­dent,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Did the US shoot it­self in the foot with the lat­est visa ban?</p>
    <p>Part of this is – jus­ti­fi­ably, some an­a­lysts say – aimed at Chi­nese stu­dents. The un­der­ly­ing as­sump­tion is that many of them stay on af­ter grad­u­a­tion in the US and be­come po­ten­tial tar­gets for the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party in its ef­forts to steal US in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>But the scat­ter­shot ap­proach af­fects all for­eign stu­dents. In any case, the as­sump­tion that all stu­dents from China are po­ten­tial spooks is trou­bling, to say the least.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in the Hous­ton Chron­i­cle last Satur­day, Rice Univer­sity doc­toral stu­dents Shub­ham Tri­pathi and Kathryn Brink said: “Two… Bills, the Se­cure Cam­pus Act and the Hold­ing China Ac­count­able Act, would ban most Chi­nese na­tion­als from con­duct­ing Stem (sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, engi­neer­ing and mathematic­s) re­search in the United States.</p>
    <p>“These pro­pos­als, part of a broader ef­fort to cap­i­talise po­lit­i­cally on the grow­ing anti-Chi­nese sen­ti­ment re­sult­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic, will do ir­repara­ble dam­age to the Amer­i­can re­search en­ter­prise and to the Amer­i­can econ­omy,” they warned.</p>
    <p>This is na­tivism, and it is prob­lem­atic, Dr Paul Sullivan, who lec­tures at the Na­tional De­fence Univer­sity and Johns Hop­kins</p>
    <p>Univer­sity, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“This coun­try was built on im­mi­grants, built on im­ported skills and knowl­edge. Most of our No­bel lau­re­ates are from out­side the coun­try orig­i­nally.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple will go and work else­where or stay in their own coun­tries,” he said. “And even more egre­gious is the cut­ting off of stu­dent visas. Amer­i­can stu­dents along­side for­eign stu­dents learn from each other.”</p>
    <p>Also, sons and daugh­ters of for­eign busi­ness, in­tel­lec­tual and po­lit­i­cal elites, whose par­ents may have stud­ied in the US, may now think twice about study­ing in the coun­try, given the uncer­tain­ties. That re­duces the power and ap­peal of Amer­i­can ideals.</p>
    <p>“The Amer­i­can ex­pe­ri­ence would be­come lim­ited, by de­fault one’s knowl­edge of the United States would be de­fined by Hol­ly­wood and so­cial me­dia,” Dr Aparna Pande, re­search fel­low and di­rec­tor of the In­dia Ini­tia­tive at the con­ser­va­tive Hud­son In­sti­tute, told ST.</p>
    <p>Dr Pande, now 41, first came to the US at the age of eight, ac­com­pa­ny­ing her fa­ther, an In­dian civil ser­vant, who was on a mid-ca­reer Ma­son Fel­low­ship at Har­vard Kennedy School.</p>
    <p>She re­mem­bers vis­it­ing the Statue of Lib­erty, and reach­ing the very top and peer­ing out of the crown. “I loved it,” she says.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence was part of the rea­son she re­turned years later to get her PhD at Bos­ton Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>At a lively panel at Ge­orge­town Univer­sity’s ex­quis­ite Riggs Li­brary months ago, well be­fore the Covid-19 era, I was asked to speak on the ex­port of Amer­i­can val­ues.</p>
    <p>I made one point: Amer­ica’s great­est ex­port is just be­ing the United States as one knows it – open, wel­com­ing and a land of op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Bright, am­bi­tious, driven young women and men in far cor­ners of the world, with few ex­cep­tions, still dream of mak­ing it in the US.</p>
    <p>That, to­gether with mu­sic, lit­er­a­ture, art and the engi­neer­ing and tech­no­log­i­cal prow­ess that in 1969 put the first hu­man be­ing on the Moon and is de­ter­mined to put the first hu­man be­ing on Mars, is Amer­ica’s soft power.</p>
    <p>If the US changes, the hard power is likely to re­main, but the soft power el­e­ment will erode – and it is Amer­ica that will suf­fer.</p>
    <p>“We can­not turn our back on the world,” Dr Sullivan warned. “Isolationi­sm in ed­u­ca­tion will drive us deeper into medi­ocrity.”</p>
    <p>ISOLATIONI­SM AND MEDI­OCRITY</p>
    <p>We can­not turn our back on the world. Isolationi­sm in ed­u­ca­tion will drive us deeper into medi­ocrity. ’’</p>
    <p>DR PAUL SULLIVAN, who lec­tures at the Na­tional De­fence Univer­sity and Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
