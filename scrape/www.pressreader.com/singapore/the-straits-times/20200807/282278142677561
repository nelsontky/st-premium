    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester City have won ev­ery do­mes­tic tro­phy, but the Cham­pi­ons League re­mains the miss­ing piece in their col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Real Madrid, on the other hand, are the record 13-time Euro­pean Cup win­ners, so to­day’s last-16, sec­ond-leg clash is very much a case of nou­veau riche against aris­to­crats.</p>
    <p>Throw in the Barcelona con­nec­tion – Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola both played for and coached the Cata­lan gi­ants, guid­ing them to two Cham­pi­ons League tri­umphs – and it is likely to be a fiery af­fair at the Eti­had.</p>
    <p>The English Premier League side hold a 2-1 lead over the La Liga win­ners and at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the 49-year-old Spa­niard called on his side to rise to the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>“We want to win this com­pe­ti­tion for sure. We have to beat Madrid and teams like Madrid if we want to win,” he said. “We have to beat them to­mor­row and then the next rounds (in Por­tu­gal).</p>
    <p>“The fact we play against Madrid or not, I will al­ways be a Barcelona sup­porter. It’s the club where I grew up and gave me part of who I am, but when I was with Bay­ern (Mu­nich) and played against Real Madrid or Barcelona, I wanted to beat them.</p>
    <p>“I have the feel­ing to­day that we are ready to play the game, do a good per­for­mance and win. That is my feel­ing. We are ready.”</p>
    <p>While Real will be miss­ing their cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos through sus­pen­sion, City will also be with­out for­ward Ser­gio Aguero be­cause of in­jury.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing won the Span­ish league for the first time since 2017, Real are on a high and even though their tal­is­manic de­fender will be ab­sent, Guardi­ola re­mains wary of Karim Ben­zema and Zine­dine Zi­dane’s in­flu­ence from the side­lines.</p>
    <p>On the French striker, last sea­son’s sec­ond-high­est goalscorer in La Liga (21) be­hind Barca’s Lionel Messi (25), Guardi­ola said: “He’s a fan­tas­tic player, I have been aware since he was a young lad at Lyon and he’s a great player.</p>
    <p>“It’s dif­fi­cult to know when you think that you’ve got one of his (Zi­dane’s) tac­ti­cal plans cov­ered, he’ll hit you with an­other or re­vert.</p>
    <p>“We’ve watched all Madrid’s games since La Liga restarted so we’ve spo­ken about how we think Madrid might ap­proach this game, but what we have done more is</p>
    <p>WATCH OUT, REAL MADRID</p>
    <p>We want to win this com­pe­ti­tion for sure... I have the feel­ing to­day that we are ready to play the game, do a good per­for­mance and win. That is my feel­ing. We are ready.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>PEP GUARDI­OLA , Manch­ester City man­ager, wants to lead the Premier League club to their first Cham­pi­ons League ti­tle.</p>
    <p>speak as a squad about how we can cause prob­lems for them. That is what we’ve been fo­cus­ing on in the build-up to this game.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, City con­firmed their sec­ond sign­ing of the close sea­son af­ter Fer­ran Tor­res, with the ar­rival of Nathan Ake from Bournemout­h for £40 mil­lion (S$72.3 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The Dutch in­ter­na­tional de­clared his ad­mi­ra­tion for his new boss, say­ing “what he’s done in the game speaks for it­self”, but it is likely to be one de­fender in and one de­fender out for City.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola yes­ter­day said 19-yearold Spa­niard Eric Gar­cia, who has only one year left on his deal, had re­jected an ex­ten­sion and thus would likely leave to re­turn to the Nou Camp, which he left in 2017 as a La Ma­sia academy prod­uct.</p>
