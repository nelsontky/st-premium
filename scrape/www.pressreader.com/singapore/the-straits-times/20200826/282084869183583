    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power’s (MOM) weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports should also con­tain in­for­ma­tion on the state of un­em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore (Weekly re­ports will be help­ful, but in­clude more de­tails to aid job seek­ers, Aug 12).</p>
    <p>This is on top of the in­for­ma­tion on the num­ber of jobs, trainee­ships and at­tach­ments avail­able, and how many of them have been filled.</p>
    <p>The MOM’s Labour Mar­ket Ad­vance Re­lease Sec­ond Quar­ter 2020, which was re­leased on July 29, stated that un­em­ploy­ment rates rose from 2.4 per cent in March to 2.9 per cent in June. It added that “there were 90,500 un­em­ployed res­i­dents in June 2020, of whom 79,600 were cit­i­zens”.</p>
    <p>It is highly likely that these fig­ures do not in­clude those em­ploy­ees made re­dun­dant or re­trenched by mi­cro-SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises) as it is un­der­stood that MOM ex­empts em­ploy­ers that have fewer than 10 em­ploy­ees from sub­mit­ting manda­tory re­trench­ment no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>What is the ba­sis for such an ex­emp­tion? The em­ploy­ees of such or­gan­i­sa­tions are also en­ti­tled to the same priv­i­leges or sup­port as those in larger or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>SMEs, in par­tic­u­lar, the mi­cro-SMEs, are pro­foundly af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic. The cri­sis has al­ready trans­formed into an eco­nomic and labour mar­ket shock, af­fect­ing all busi­nesses re­gard­less of their size.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing months, many em­ploy­ees from mi­cro-SMEs are ex­pected to be made re­dun­dant due to the bleak eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>In the light of the dis­rup­tive im­pact of the pan­demic on jobs and liveli­hoods, the num­ber of em­ploy­ees who are re­trenched from these mi­cro-SMEs should be cap­tured, recorded and pub­lished by MOM for a more ac­cu­rate pic­ture of the state of un­em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
