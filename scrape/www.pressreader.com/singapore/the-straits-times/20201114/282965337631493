    <p>What causes high en­gine oil con­sump­tion? This is a prob­lem I have re­cently en­coun­tered. I was ad­vised by one work­shop me­chanic to use an ad­di­tive which he claimed would re­duce oil con­sump­tion. Is there such a thing?</p>
    <p>The most com­mon cause of high oil con­sump­tion is worn pis­ton rings. Made from spe­cial al­loys, th­ese rings go around the cir­cum­fer­ence of a pis­ton and serve as the seal be­tween the com­bus­tion cham­ber and crank­case of the en­gine.</p>
    <p>They are made for a very tight fit, even if the rings are de­signed to ac­com­mo­date ther­mal ex­pan­sion. Be­cause of this, the rings are able to pre­vent en­gine oil along the cylin­der walls from seep­ing into the com­bus­tion cham­ber.</p>
    <p>Over sev­eral thou­sands of kilo­me­tres, the pis­tons and cylin­der walls will ex­pe­ri­ence wear, com­pro­mis­ing the seal. This is when oil seep­age be­gins to oc­cur.</p>
    <p>There will be a no­tice­able in­crease in oil con­sump­tion and even­tu­ally, bluish-grey smoke spew­ing out the ex­haust pipe.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar ser­vic­ing with high qual­ity en­gine lu­bri­cant will pro­long the life of pis­ton rings and de­lay the on­set of cylin­der wall wear.</p>
    <p>But over time, wear will still set in. Con­tin­u­ing to run a car with worn rings will cause a de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in over­all per­for­mance and con­tam­i­na­tion of the oil, which fur­ther ex­ac­er­bates wear – not just to the cylin­ders but also other parts such as the crank­shaft bear­ings.</p>
    <p>Hence, re­plac­ing the rings is the only rem­edy.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tives are noth­ing more than tem­po­rary re­lief and some may even cause fur­ther en­gine dam­age in the long run.</p>
