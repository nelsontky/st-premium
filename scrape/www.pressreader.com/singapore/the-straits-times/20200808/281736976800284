    <p>• Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro has is­sued a de­cree that will set aside 1.9 bil­lion reais (S$488 mil­lion) to buy and even­tu­ally pro­duce the po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity re­searchers.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s Act­ing Health Min­is­ter Ed­uardo Pazuello said the vac­cine could be avail­able for Brazil­ians by De­cem­ber or Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>He called the vac­cine “the most promis­ing in the world” to fight the virus.</p>
    <p>“Jan­uary is the best bet. The vac­cine is the so­lu­tion to end the pan­demic,” Gen­eral Pazuello said dur­ing Mr Bol­sonaro’s weekly live chat on Facebook.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca’s can­di­date is seen as the front run­ner in the global race to de­liver an ef­fec­tive vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>On Thursday, the Bri­tish drug­maker struck a deal to pro­duce the vac­cine in China.</p>
    <p>Gen Pazuello said Brazil would ini­tially re­ceive 100 mil­lion doses, which would al­low for the vac­ci­na­tion of half the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion, and then pro­duce the vac­cine lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Mr Bol­sonaro, who has re­peat­edly min­imised the grav­ity of the pan­demic, said again that the col­lat­eral dam­age of wide­spread un­em­ploy­ment caused by lock­downs en­forced by state gover­nors and may­ors was worse than the virus it­self.</p>
    <p>Yet Brazil is ap­proach­ing 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 in the world’s worst coro­n­avirus out­break af­ter the United States.</p>
    <p>On Thursday, the Health Min­istry re­ported 53,139 con­firmed new cases and 1,237 deaths in the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Brazil has reg­is­tered nearly three mil­lion con­firmed cases since the pan­demic be­gan, while the of­fi­cial death toll has risen to more than 98,000, ac­cord­ing to min­istry data.</p>
