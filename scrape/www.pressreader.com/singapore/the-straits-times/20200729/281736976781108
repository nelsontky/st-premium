    <p>SYD­NEY • Nearly three bil­lion an­i­mals were killed or dis­placed by Aus­tralia’s un­prece­dented 2019-20 bush fires in “one of the worst wildlife dis­as­ters in mod­ern his­tory”, ac­cord­ing to a re­port re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The study by sci­en­tists from sev­eral Aus­tralian uni­ver­si­ties said the wildlife hit in­cluded 143 mil­lion mam­mals, 2.46 bil­lion rep­tiles, 180 mil­lion birds and 51 mil­lion frogs.</p>
    <p>While the re­port did not say how many an­i­mals died be­cause of the fires, the prospects for those that es­caped the flames “were prob­a­bly not great” due to a lack of food, shel­ter and pro­tec­tion from preda­tors, said Pro­fes­sor Chris Dick­man, one of its au­thors.</p>
    <p>The fires rav­aged more than 115,000 sq m of drought-stricken bush land and for­est across Aus­tralia late last year and early this year, killing over 30 peo­ple and de­stroy­ing thou­sands of homes.</p>
    <p>It was the broad­est and most pro­longed bush fire sea­son in mod­ern Aus­tralian his­tory, with sci­en­tists at­tribut­ing the sever­ity of the cri­sis to the im­pacts of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier study in Jan­uary es­ti­mated that the fires had killed a bil­lion an­i­mals in the hard­est-hit eastern states of New South Wales and Vic­to­ria. But the sur­vey re­leased yes­ter­day was the first to cover fire zones across the con­ti­nent, said lead sci­en­tist Lily van Ee­den of the Univer­sity of Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>Re­sults from the sur­vey were still be­ing pro­cessed, with a fi­nal re­port due to be re­leased late next month, but the au­thors said the num­ber of three bil­lion an­i­mals af­fected was un­likely to change.</p>
    <p>“The in­terim find­ings are shock­ing,” said Mr Der­mot O’Gor­man, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Aus­tralian branch of the World Wide Fund for Na­ture, which com­mis­sioned the re­port.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to think of an­other event any­where in the world in liv­ing mem­ory that has killed or dis­placed that many an­i­mals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife dis­as­ters in mod­ern his­tory.”</p>
    <p>The plight of Aus­tralia’s pop­u­lar koalas dur­ing the fires gar­nered in­ter­na­tional me­dia at­ten­tion, with thou­sands of the tree-dwelling mar­su­pi­als be­lieved to have died.</p>
    <p>But a gov­ern­ment re­port early this year cited 100 other threat­ened na­tive plant and an­i­mal species that had lost more than half their habi­tat to the blazes, rais­ing the prospect of far greater losses.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say global warm­ing is length­en­ing Aus­tralia’s sum­mers and mak­ing them in­creas­ingly dan­ger­ous, with shorter win­ters mak­ing it more dif­fi­cult to carry out bush fire preven­tion work.</p>
    <p>The re­port was by sci­en­tists from the Univer­sity of Syd­ney, Univer­sity of New South Wales, Univer­sity of Newcastle, Charles Sturt Univer­sity and con­ser­va­tion group BirdLife Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The study by sci­en­tists from sev­eral Aus­tralian uni­ver­si­ties said the wildlife hit in­cluded 143 mil­lion mam­mals, 2.46 bil­lion rep­tiles, 180 mil­lion birds and 51 mil­lion frogs.</p>
