    <p>• Madonna (right) has re­vealed that her next project will be the movie of her life – and the fi­nal prod­uct should meet with her ap­proval as she is bring­ing it to the screen her­self.</p>
    <p>The Queen of Pop, whose four­decade ca­reer as a singer, ac­tress and cul­tural touch­stone has taken in sex, re­li­gion and other tra­di­tional taboos, will di­rect the biopic, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from movie stu­dio Univer­sal Pic­tures.</p>
    <p>Madonna will also co-write the film with Amer­i­can writer Di­ablo Cody, who won an Os­car for the screen­play of com­ing-of-age dram­edy Juno (2007).</p>
    <p>“I want to con­vey the in­cred­i­ble jour­ney that life has taken me on as an artist, a mu­si­cian, a dancer – a hu­man be­ing,” Madonna, 62, said in a state­ment posted on her web­site.</p>
    <p>“The fo­cus of this film will al­ways be mu­sic,” she added. “Mu­sic has kept me go­ing and art has kept me alive.”</p>
    <p>The en­ter­tainer en­thused about “so many un­told and in­spir­ing sto­ries” from her “roller-coaster” life and asked: “Who bet­ter to tell it than me?”</p>
    <p>Univer­sal chair­man Donna Lan­g­ley de­scribed the Michi­gan na­tive – real name Madonna Louise Cic­cone – as “the ul­ti­mate icon”.</p>
    <p>“With her sin­gu­lar gift of cre­at­ing art that is as ac­ces­si­ble as it is bound­ary-push­ing, she has shaped our cul­ture in a way very few oth­ers have,” Ms Lan­g­ley said.</p>
    <p>Madonna, re­spon­si­ble for hits such as Like A Prayer, Ma­te­rial Girl and Like A Vir­gin, is one of the most pro­lific artists of her time, hav­ing sold 335 mil­lion al­bums.</p>
    <p>She landed her first ma­jor screen role in 1985’s Des­per­ately Seek­ing Su­san and won the Best Ac­tress Golden Globe for Evita (1996) be­fore di­rect­ing and co-writ­ing the his­tor­i­cal ro­man­tic drama W.E. in 2011.</p>
