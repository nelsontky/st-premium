    <p>As a global avi­a­tion hub, Singapore will play a cru­cial role in trans­port­ing Covid-19 vac­cines around the world, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>In a tele­vised ad­dress yesterday on the next steps for the na­tion, PM Lee out­lined how Singapore is well po­si­tioned to han­dle large vol­umes of vac­cines, which he said will sup­port “our re­cov­ery in more ways than one”.</p>
    <p>He noted that the vac­cines would re­quire cold chain man­age­ment, as they must be trans­ported in a tem­per­a­ture-con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment at ev­ery stage of their jour­ney.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the Pfizer vaccine would have to be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C, which, PM Lee noted, was colder than the Arc­tic.</p>
    <p>“This re­quires in­fras­truc­ture, high stan­dards, skilled per­son­nel, and good con­nec­tiv­ity to many dif­fer­ent coun­tries and all along the sup­ply chain,” he said.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, Singapore has a strong ecosys­tem for cargo han­dling, PM Lee said, point­ing to how Singapore Air­lines (SIA) and Changi Air­port’s ground han­dling part­ners have been cer­ti­fied by the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion to han­dle and trans­port phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing global lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies such as DHL, United Par­cel Ser­vice and FedEx are also based here, he added.</p>
    <p>“We are now gear­ing our­selves up to han­dle large vol­umes of vaccine ship­ments into and through Singapore, to help win the global fight against Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Firms in the air cargo sec­tor have in­ten­si­fied prepa­ra­tions in re­cent months in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the up­com­ing ex­er­cise to dis­trib­ute vac­cines around the globe.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, the Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Singapore and Changi Air­port Group have set up a task force to work on the vaccine ship­ment process. The task force com­prises 18 mem­bers in the air cargo sec­tor, in­clud­ing SIA and ground han­dlers Sats and dnata.</p>
    <p>In a brief­ing last week, the task force said the air cargo hub here is ready to han­dle vaccine ship­ments com­ing into and through Singapore, hav­ing in­vested ex­ten­sively in the han­dling of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ship­ments over the years.</p>
    <p>PM Lee at­trib­uted the readi­ness to han­dle the vac­cines to for­ward plan­ning as well as the sys­tem­atic cre­ation of op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“It took us years of in­vest­ment and plan­ning, build­ing a busi­ness­friendly cli­mate and ex­pand­ing our air links around the world,” he said. “Th­ese long-term in­vest­ments are now pay­ing div­i­dends.”</p>
