    <p>PETAL­ING JAYA • The Malaysian gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing whether to im­pose a fine or jail time on those who refuse to wear a mask, once the use of face masks is made manda­tory in pub­lic places, said the coun­try’s health di­rec­tor-gen­eral, Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah.</p>
    <p>He said on Tues­day that the grow­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions was wor­ry­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases hit dou­ble dig­its for the fourth straight day yesterday.</p>
    <p>There were 16 new cases yesterday. The coun­try now has a to­tal of 8,831 cases, with 123 deaths.</p>
    <p>If the wear­ing of a face mask is made manda­tory in pub­lic places un­der the Preven­tion and Con­trol of In­fec­tious Dis­eases Act, Dr Noor Hisham said that those who flout the law could be fined RM1,000 (S$326) or jailed.</p>
    <p>“The Health Min­istry is en­cour­ag­ing the use of face masks, es­pe­cially in pub­lic places, high-risk places or places where so­cial dis­tanc­ing of 1m apart is hard to en­force.</p>
    <p>“We have cur­rently not made it manda­tory be­cause once we make it manda­tory un­der the Act, we would have to con­sider the pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are still look­ing at the pun­ish­ment – whether to fine or give jail time for those not wear­ing face masks – once its use is made com­pul­sory,” he said dur­ing a brief­ing on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated the min­istry’s rec­om­men­da­tion on the use of face masks, which could re­duce the risk of in­fec­tion by 65 per cent, as well as so­cial dis­tanc­ing, which could re­duce trans­mis­sion by up to 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>On Twit­ter, Dr Noor Hisham said:</p>
    <p>“Suc­cess breeds com­pla­cency, and com­pla­cency breeds fail­ure.”</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry had ex­pected to see zero new cases as early as the mid­dle of this month, after weeks of mostly fewer than 10 new cases de­tected each day.</p>
    <p>He urged Malaysians to avoid crowded spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Dr Noor Hisham said the min­istry recorded four re­cov­er­ies and 16 new Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Of the 16 new in­fec­tions, eight were im­ported cases in­volv­ing four Malaysians and four for­eign­ers who are res­i­dents in the coun­try or who came into the coun­try for work.</p>
    <p>“Of the eight lo­cal cases, seven cases in­volved Malaysians and one in­volved a for­eigner who was screened when leav­ing the coun­try,” Dr Noor Hisham said.</p>
    <p>The seven cases in­volv­ing Malaysians were from Sarawak.</p>
    <p>“Up un­til now, only five cases are still be­ing treated in in­ten­sive care units. One re­quires a ven­ti­la­tor,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also said there were no new fa­tal­i­ties, with the death toll re­main­ing at 123.</p>
    <p>Start­ing to­mor­row, Malaysia re­quires all vis­i­tors to un­dergo quar­an­tine at ap­pointed cen­tres, in­stead of at home, after a photo of a per­son flout­ing home quar­an­tine rules spread on­line.</p>
