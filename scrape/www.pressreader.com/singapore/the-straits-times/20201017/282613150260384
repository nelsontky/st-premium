    <p>NEW YORK • Amer­i­can singer Tay­lor Swift, ac­tor Bradley Cooper and Aus­tralian singer Keith Ur­ban have do­nated guitars to a celebrity coun­try mu­sic auc­tion, as they try to raise funds for ev­ery­day work­ers in the in­dus­try whose liveli­hoods have been dev­as­tated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Swift’s signed black Gib­son acous­tic gui­tar, that she played for the live de­but per­for­mance of her new song Betty last month, comes along with nine of her cus­tom picks in a lot that could fetch US$25,000 (S$34,000) to US$40,000, Christie’s auc­tion house said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The elec­tric gui­tar Cooper played as washed-up coun­try singer Jack­son Maine in his 2018 film A Star Is Born is also up for sale, with an es­ti­mate price of US$2,000 to US$4,000.</p>
    <p>The auc­tion, start­ing on Thurs­day and run­ning un­til Oct 29, will ben­e­fit the Academy of Coun­try Mu­sic’s Lift­ing Lives Covid-19 Re­sponse Fund, which was cre­ated to sup­port peo­ple be­hind the scenes in the coun­try mu­sic in­dus­try cen­tred around Nashville.</p>
    <p>Ms Nancy Valentino from Christie’s busi­ness de­vel­op­ment depart­ment said: “This is one of the in­stances where you have the artists help­ing the peo­ple who work with them – tour bus driv­ers, road­ies, ses­sion work­ers, cater­ers. No one is work­ing.”</p>
    <p>Other auc­tion items in­clude a be­daz­zled dul­cimer owned by coun­try singer Dolly Par­ton for 30 years (US$50,000 to US$100,000), Grammy-win­ning mu­si­cian Sheryl Crow’s vin­tage Bal­doni ac­cor­dion (US$8,000 to US$12,000) and guitars owned by singers Keith Ur­ban, Dwight Yoakam, Blake Shel­ton and Vince Gill.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the in­stru­ments, coun­try singer Tim McGraw is auc­tion­ing his F131 Hell­cat mo­tor­cy­cle, while for­mer Amer­i­can Idol win­ner Car­rie Underwood do­nated the gown she wore to the Academy of Coun­try Mu­sic awards show in Nashville last month.</p>
    <p>“We were so im­pressed by how quickly artists vol­un­teered to do­nate, and do­nated things that are so spe­cial to them,” Ms Valentino said.</p>
