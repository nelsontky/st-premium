    <p>Bar­ring a dra­matic de­ci­sion by the courts in the United States, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den has se­cured more than suf­fi­cient votes from the elec­toral col­lege – a quirk of the Amer­i­can demo­cratic sys­tem that some­times seems to bend against the pop­u­lar vote – to clinch the pres­i­dency, and form the coun­try’s 46th ad­min­is­tra­tion with Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris. The big­gest turnout in US elec­tion his­tory has pro­pelled Mr Bi­den, who turns 78 this month, to outscore in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump in sev­eral key swing states, and bring him now to the apex of a po­lit­i­cal ca­reer which stretches back some five decades to his Se­nate de­but in 1972. Go­ing by the pop­u­lar vote count, Mr Trump re­tains sig­nif­i­cant sup­port, which has no doubt con­trib­uted to him and his team mount­ing chal­lenges to the re­sults in what has been a bit­ter con­test that ex­posed deep di­vi­sions in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Recognisin­g th­ese fis­sures and the tu­mul­tuous four years for the US and the world since Mr Trump’s 2016 win, Mr Bi­den spoke of a need for unity, say­ing he sought the pres­i­dency to re­store the soul of Amer­ica, re­build the na­tion’s back­bone and to make Amer­ica re­spected around the world again. His to-do list is sig­nif­i­cantly long. Mr Trump came into the pres­i­dency with no pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ence in pub­lic of­fice. That lack of ex­pe­ri­ence in gov­ern­ment has been costly for the US, par­tic­u­larly in the way the ad­min­is­tra­tion failed to sub­stan­tially and con­sis­tently re­store the econ­omy at home and, most re­cently, ig­nored sci­en­tific ad­vice in han­dling the Covid-19 pan­demic, which now has taken more than 240,000 Amer­i­can lives and is see­ing a fresh spike with the ar­rival of the cold sea­son. Ra­cial, eth­nic, po­lit­i­cal and in­come di­vides have wors­ened. The “Amer­ica First” poli­cies he pur­sued on trade and other ar­eas, such as de­fence, may have been a re­sponse to his po­lit­i­cal ground but its re­sults have not helped. Cer­tainly, it left key global al­lies alien­ated and per­plexed. The 46th pres­i­dency will thus need to be a heal­ing one, lit­er­ally and fig­u­ra­tively, do­mes­ti­cally and glob­ally. It has to start un­der­stand­ably at home. With the US lead­ing the world in pan­demic cases, the ur­gent task – and it ap­pears his team is as­sem­bling a Covid-19 task force – is to fash­ion a med­i­cally in­formed ap­proach to the scourge. The econ­omy needs help to re­cover, and balm needs to be ap­plied to the race di­vide.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den also ap­pears ready to un­wind on Amer­ica’s re­treat to iso­la­tion­ism. His ad­min­is­tra­tion needs to reaf­firm its readi­ness to re­build al­liances, re­store faith in mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and global in­sti­tu­tions. There has been a pal­pa­ble uptick in the global re­sponse to a Bi­den win, one that counts on the US to re­sume its role as a trusted and re­li­able ally. Mr Bi­den’s long ex­pe­ri­ence in po­lit­i­cal of­fice and his pledge of unity must count in­ter­na­tion­ally too.</p>
