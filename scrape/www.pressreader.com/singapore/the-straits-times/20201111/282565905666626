    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a bal­anced diet, keep­ing up with a fit­ness rou­tine and, most im­por­tantly, re­mind­ing my­self that my body is my tem­ple and to take care of it.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a time when you were not fit and fab?</p>
    <p>Yes, dur­ing my sec­ondary school days, when I could not re­sist a McDonald’s cheese­burger ev­ery other day.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>I strike a bal­ance be­tween car­bo­hy­drates and pro­tein-rich food such as fish, chicken and turkey breast. I sub­sti­tute rice with quinoa. I avoid hav­ing din­ner af­ter 7pm and I drink a lot of wa­ter through­out the day.</p>
    <p>What are your in­dul­gences? I am a sucker for choco­late.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>I make it a point to go for a run af­ter work with my hus­band. Not only does it keep my body healthy, but it also helps me destress. On days that I am not run­ning, I swim 30 laps.</p>
    <p>I also re­cently joined a gym with my friends and we do kick­box­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>Do­ing dif­fer­ent ex­er­cises each day helps me stay mo­ti­vated and avoid bore­dom. I am also more en­cour­aged to main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance that way.</p>
    <p>What are the three most im­por­tant things in your life?</p>
    <p>Fam­ily, health and hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>What is your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>My favourite part has to be my legs. Swim­ming and run­ning help me main­tain lean and strong legs.</p>
    <p>If I have to choose the least favourite part, it would be my ab­dom­i­nal area. When I put on weight, that’s where it shows.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and af­ter a workout?</p>
    <p>Stretch­ing is essen­tial be­fore any workout. Af­ter my workout, I make sure I drink enough wa­ter.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant is it for you to keep up with your fit­ness rou­tine?</p>
    <p>Main­tain­ing a rou­tine is im­por­tant as it keeps my body and mind healthy and happy. As I get older, I find that rou­tine is even more im­por­tant as my me­tab­o­lism has slowed down over the years.</p>
    <p>Con­sum­ing al­co­hol and eat­ing what­ever I wanted was still okay while I was in my early 20s. Now, I have taken a more se­ri­ous ap­proach to keep­ing up with ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly and main­tain­ing a bal­anced diet.</p>
    <p>What are the changes you have made to keep ex­er­cis­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic?</p>
    <p>I fol­lowed videos on­line and did home work­outs when the gyms were closed.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive life­style in­flu­enced your fam­ily and friends?</p>
    <p>It was my hus­band who en­cour­aged me to try some­thing dif­fer­ent, like kick­box­ing.</p>
    <p>In turn, though he dis­liked swim­ming be­fore, he has started to join me ev­ery other evening.</p>
    <p>What is the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fit­ness?</p>
    <p>It would have to be a 25km race called Xing – B2Run that I did in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>The run was or­gan­ised by my com­pany and I trained for it with my col­leagues, three times a week af­ter work.</p>
    <p>How ex­ten­sive is your col­lec­tion of sports-re­lated para­pher­na­lia?</p>
    <p>I have a pair of run­ning shoes, a few swim­suits and a pair of box­ing gloves.</p>
    <p>Would you go for plas­tic surgery? I haven’t had any pro­ce­dures, but who knows what will hap­pen in the fu­ture? It is some­thing I am not against. To each her own.</p>
    <p>Do you think you are sexy?</p>
    <p>I think ev­ery­one is sexy. You just have to be con­fi­dent about your body and treat it right.</p>
