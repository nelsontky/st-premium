    <p>All eyes will be on the Speaker of the Jo­hor as­sem­bly as the state leg­is­la­ture sits to­day, amid in­tense spec­u­la­tion over a hung as­sem­bly and pos­si­ble de­fec­tions of sev­eral as­sem­bly­men.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact in Malaysia’s sec­ond-rich­est state is faced with un­cer­tainty over the sta­tus and loy­alty of for­mer men­teri be­sar Os­man Sapian.</p>
    <p>Datuk Os­man is a mem­ber of Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) but has been seen in vi­ral videos with lead­ers of Pe­juang, a new ri­val party set up by for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>If Mr Os­man leaves or gets kicked out of Ber­satu, both PN and the op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) will have 28 as­sem­bly­men each in the as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor PN cur­rently has 29 seats in the state as­sem­bly against PH’s 27.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor Speaker Suhaizan Kayat said he would be the tie-breaker in the event of a no-con­fi­dence vote.</p>
    <p>“If there is a hung as­sem­bly, the Speaker will cast the de­cid­ing vote,” Mr Suhaizan, who is from op­po­si­tion Parti Amanah Ne­gara, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>A mo­tion of no-con­fi­dence has to be pro­posed 14 days be­fore the as­sem­bly, which will con­vene to­day and on Sun­day, af­ter hav­ing had a one-day ses­sion on May 14.</p>
    <p>If Chief Min­is­ter Hasni Mo­ham­mad loses the vote, he can ei­ther re­sign or ad­vise the Sul­tan to dis­solve the state as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>“As of now, I do not ex­pect a dis­so­lu­tion of the as­sem­bly. I think the ses­sion will run smoothly,” said Mr Suhaizan yes­ter­day, adding that Mr Os­man has not re­quested to sit on the op­po­si­tion bench.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal sources say that PN is try­ing to bring over as­sem­bly­men from Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat and Amanah into the rul­ing coali­tion be­fore act­ing on Mr Os­man, or the as­sem­bly sit­ting, to avoid a pre­ma­ture dis­so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Sabah state in eastern Malaysia is hold­ing state-wide polls later this month af­ter a spate of de­fec­tions and a failed coup.</p>
    <p>“There are ef­forts to en­tice in­di­vid­u­als to join PN to boost its num­bers but, so far, no one has switched sides,” an op­po­si­tion Jo­hor politi­cian told ST.</p>
    <p>There is also talk of Ber­satu law­mak­ers join­ing Pe­juang. Five Ber­satu as­sem­bly­men met Jo­hor’s Sul­tan Ibrahim Sul­tan Iskan­dar on Mon­day to af­firm that they will not be switch­ing to the op­po­si­tion, but this did not in­clude for­mer men­teri be­sar Os­man.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu’s dis­ci­plinary board had an­nounced Mr Os­man’s ex­pul­sion last week fol­low­ing re­ports that he had cam­paigned for ri­val Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air at the re­cent Slim by-elec­tion in Perak, but later said it was still in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, Mr Os­man has per­sisted in con­sort­ing with Pe­juang party lead­ers, and a sec­ond video went vi­ral on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In June, Sul­tan Ibrahim said he was dis­ap­pointed with the state’s po­lit­i­cal tur­moil. “If there is power grab­bing hap­pen­ing among the elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives, then I will im­me­di­ately dis­solve the Jo­hor state as­sem­bly,” he had warned.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor Awang Az­man Awang Pawi of Univer­siti Malaya said: “PN Jo­hor will try to avoid state polls... to fo­cus on han­dling the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic, in par­tic­u­lar the econ­omy. I think they will wait for na­tion­wide elec­tions which are ex­pected by the year end.”</p>
    <p>If state polls are called, it would come at a try­ing time for PN al­lies Umno, Ber­satu and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS), as the for­mer po­lit­i­cal en­e­mies which had con­tested against one an­other in many con­stituen­cies must now agree on which one of them would con­test in what seats.</p>
    <p>Said Jo­hor PKR chief Syed Ibrahim Syed Noh: “Rather than pol­i­tick­ing and power grab­bing, we would pre­fer to have a sta­ble gov­ern­ment. The peo­ple are quite dis­ap­pointed with what is hap­pen­ing now, law­mak­ers jump­ing here and there. They feel they have no say.”</p>
