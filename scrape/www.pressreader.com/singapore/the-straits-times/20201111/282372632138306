    <p>LON­DON The Viet­namese Grand Prix was ab­sent from a draft 2021 cal­en­dar pub­lished by For­mula One yes­ter­day that fea­tured a record 23 rounds, with a de­but in Saudi Ara­bia and Brazil re­turn­ing de­spite fears for that race’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam was due to host a street race in Hanoi for the first time in April, but that was can­celled due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of the grand prix on next year’s cal­en­dar has been at­trib­uted to lo­cal po­lit­i­cal is­sues, al­though F1 did not give a rea­son or men­tion Viet­nam in a state­ment that set out the planned sea­son.</p>
    <p>It said: “The plans for 2021 have in­volved ex­ten­sive di­a­logue with all pro­mot­ers and their lo­cal and na­tional au­thor­i­ties at a time of on­go­ing flu­id­ity re­lated to the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Our hosts for 2021 are re­as­sured by our safe re­turn to rac­ing this sea­son, and con­fi­dent that the plans and pro­ce­dures we have in place will al­low us to re­turn to a level of nor­mal­ity for the 2021 sea­son.</p>
    <p>“As we have said be­fore, we ex­pect fans to re­turn for the 2021 sea­son and for the cal­en­dar to look sim­i­lar to the orig­i­nally planned 2020 sea­son.”</p>
    <p>The BBC re­ported that the de­ci­sion not to host the race fol­lowed the ar­rest in Au­gust of Hanoi Peo­ple’s Com­mit­tee chair­man Nguyen Duc Chung for the al­leged “ap­pro­pri­a­tion of se­cret state doc­u­ments”.</p>
    <p>Nguyen was the key fig­ure in­volved in pro­mot­ing the race and ac­cord­ing to the BBC, Viet­namese au­thor­i­ties have told F1 that fol­low­ing his ar­rest, they have “other pri­or­i­ties, in­clud­ing their 2021 leg­isla­tive elec­tion, the pan­demic and re­cov­ery from Typhoon Molave and Goni” in mind.</p>
    <p>The April 25 slot has been left va­cant but var­i­ous cir­cuits are in the frame, with rac­ing web­site GPFans say­ing the Por­tuguese Grand Prix may re­turn. The Por­ti­mao race was staged last month af­ter a 24-year ab­sence.</p>
    <p>F1 has never be­fore had more than 21 races in a sea­son, al­though or­gan­is­ers ini­tially planned for 22 races this year un­til the coro­n­avirus dec­i­mated the cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>All grands prix this cam­paign have ei­ther been held be­hind closed doors or in front of se­verely re­stricted num­bers, but chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Chase Carey is ex­pect­ing a re­turn to the usual norm next year.</p>
    <p>“We are plan­ning for 2021 events with fans that pro­vide an ex­pe­ri­ence close to nor­mal and ex­pect our agree­ments to be hon­oured,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have proven that we can safely travel and op­er­ate our races, and our pro­mot­ers in­creas­ingly recog­nise the need to move for­ward and man­age the virus.</p>
    <p>“We are de­lighted to see Saudi Ara­bia be­come part of the sched­ule and are equally ex­cited to re­turn to the venues we hoped to race at in 2020.”</p>
    <p>Brazil’s race at Sao Paulo’s In­ter­la­gos cir­cuit on Nov 14 is sub­ject to a new con­tract be­ing agreed, as is Spain’s round in Barcelona on May 9.</p>
    <p>F1 had planned to move to a new cir­cuit in Rio de Janeiro but that has proved con­tro­ver­sial for en­vi­ron­men­tal rea­sons and work has yet to start.</p>
    <p>The Dutch Grand Prix at Zand­voort re­turns for the first time since 1985 with a race on Sept 5, while Rus­sia, Sin­ga­pore – which is en­ter­ing the fi­nal year of its fouryear ex­ten­sion – and Ja­pan will form a first l ong-haul triple­header on Sept 26, Oct 3 and Oct 10.</p>
    <p>McLaren boss Zak Brown said the planned 23 races rep­re­sented “ex­tremely pos­i­tive news” for the sport’s teams and part­ners af­ter a tough term.</p>
