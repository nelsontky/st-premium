    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Former fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng, who was charged with cor­rup­tion last Fri­day, is no stranger to run-ins with the law, with cases go­ing back to the 1980s. Here is a snap­shot of some of the high­lights of his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>1986:</p>
    <p>Lim, the son of veteran law­maker Lim Kit Siang, was elected MP in the seat of Kota Me­laka for the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) in 1986. He re­tained his seat in the 1990 and 1995 elec­tions.</p>
    <p>De­tained un­der the now-de­funct In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act (ISA) in a mass crack­down on po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents by then Pre­mier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, along with 106 other politi­cians and ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Re­leased from ISA de­ten­tion. Ar­rested fol­low­ing his crit­i­cism of the gov­ern­ment’s fail­ure to bring the statu­tory rape case of then Me­laka Chief Min­is­ter Ab­dul Rahim Thamby Chik to trial as the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral de­cided not to press charges.</p>
    <p>Lim was charged un­der the Sedi­tion Act, and also the Print­ing Presses and Publi­ca­tions Act for “ma­li­ciously print­ing” a pam­phlet con­tain­ing “false in­for­ma­tion” about the al­leged rape vic­tim. He was sen­tenced to 18 months’ im­pris­on­ment and re­leased af­ter 12 months in Au­gust 1999.</p>
    <p>1987: 1989: 1994: 2004:</p>
    <p>Elected to the post of DAP sec­re­tary-gen­eral, a po­si­tion he still holds. The DAP today has 42 MPs in Par­lia­ment in­clud­ing Lim, mak­ing it the big­gest party in the House.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion Pakatan Rakyat won 29 out of 40 state assem­bly seats con­tested in Pe­nang. Lim, who won the state seat of Air Pu­tih, served as chief min­is­ter un­til 2018.</p>
    <p>Pe­nang state gov­ern­ment an­nounced a RM27 bil­lion (S$8.8 bil­lion) Pe­nang Trans­port Mas­ter Plan, which in­cludes an un­der­sea tun­nel con­nect­ing Pe­nang is­land to the penin­sula.</p>
    <p>Lim was charged with cor­rup­tion over the pur­chase of a house from busi­ness­woman Phang Li Koon at be­low mar­ket value in 2015. He was also charged with abus­ing his power by re-zon­ing a plot of land that was ac­quired by a com­pany linked to Ms Phang.</p>
    <p>Ap­pointed fi­nance min­is­ter i n Tun Dr Ma­hathir’s new Pakatan Hara­pan gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Lim was ac­quit­ted, along with Ms Phang, of charges over the bun­ga­low and land, by the Pe­nang High Court.</p>
    <p>Lim pleaded not guilty to a charge of so­lic­it­ing a bribe of 10 per cent of fu­ture prof­its from a com­pany that was awarded a con­tract to build the Pe­nang un­der­sea tun­nel.</p>
