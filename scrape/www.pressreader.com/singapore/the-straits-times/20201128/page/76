ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW WHERE TO FIND IT House for sale Class 403 D10 • Nothing quite like it Luxurious semi-d for sale • Elevated living In urban areas throughout Singapore, although two gazetted heritage roads, Arcadia Road and Mandai Road, are lined with them. So far, 15 Rain Trees have been gazetted as Heritage Trees, with most of them concentrat­ed in the central area. Green Heritage WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IT Rain tree There is a variant sporting yellow mature trees that has been planted in Singapore since the 1950s.
The tree's crown is covered in clusters of pink-white flowers when in bloom, and its leaves fold up in anticipati­on of rainy weather - thus its name. VITAL STATS
This deciduous tree can grow up to 30m tall and has a very wide umbrella-shaped crown that can extend for as long as 30m. It is the most commonly planted tree in Singapore due to the superior shade it provides, with an estimated 26,000 in existence. DID YOU KNOW
In Malay, it is known as the Pukul Lima (five o'clock tree) as the leaves would also close just before sunset.
The sunset hour in Singapore used to be at around 5pm until the Singapore Standard Time was created in 1982. Class 406 D15 le STFi S: PHOTO
