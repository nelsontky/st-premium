    <p>From next Fri­day, Gar­dens by the Bay will be all lit up with lanterns in the evening to cel­e­brate the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>An an­nual af­fair at the Gar­dens, this year’s event will also fea­ture on­line per­for­mances and ac­tiv­i­ties to bring cheer as Sin­ga­pore­ans ad­just to life in the new nor­mal caused by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Six lantern sets spread across the Gar­dens will high­light the themes of fam­ily re­union and unity in the com­mu­nity, qual­i­ties es­pe­cially mean­ing­ful in these ex­tra­or­di­nary times, said Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors can seek out the Apricot Grove light-up at Golden Gar­den, where they will find apricot flow­ers in bloom. Gobo light­ing, where sten­cils are placed in front of a light source, will add a fin­ish­ing touch to the dis­play by sim­u­lat­ing the ef­fect of fall­ing petals.</p>
    <p>In­spired by the fa­ble of Dong Feng, a skilled med­i­cal prac­ti­tioner who lived dur­ing China’s Three Kingdoms pe­riod, this flo­ral set is a trib­ute to Singapore’s health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>Another note­wor­thy dis­play to</p>
    <p>check out is Wa­ter Song, which is lo­cated near the Planet sculp­ture. The lantern set fea­tures five framed scenes based on Song Dy­nasty poet Su Shi’s fa­mous poem, in which he longs for his fam­ily while gaz­ing at the moon in mi­dau­tumn.</p>
    <p>At the Su­pertree Grove, vis­i­tors can stroll along the Colon­nade of Lights con­sist­ing of 1,500 hand­painted and coloured lanterns. The</p>
    <p>lantern set was put to­gether by Gar­dens by the Bay se­nior work­ers and vol­un­teers, with the help of so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Another dis­play at the Su­pertree Grove is the Il­lu­mi­na­tions of Joy lantern set, with its an­i­mal-shaped de­signs.</p>
    <p>At the Royal Fam­ily’s Walk lantern set, which was first dis­played at the Seoul Lantern Fes­ti­val last year, a Joseon Dy­nasty royal pro­ces­sion comes alive with del­i­cate fig­ures of a king, queen and their en­tourage.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated at the Su­pertree Grove, the dis­play is made from hanji, or Korean tra­di­tional paper de­rived from the bark of the mul­berry tree.</p>
    <p>Along the Scented Walk near Bayfront Plaza, vis­i­tors will find 10 Pros­per­ity Rats, which first made their ap­pear­ance at the Gar­dens dur­ing Chi­nese New Year to mark the Year of the Rat.</p>
    <p>The lantern sets will be a fea­ture at the Gar­dens un­til Oct 4, and will light up from 7pm to 10pm daily.</p>
    <p>Con­cur­rently, per­for­mances by Chi­nese flautist and com­poser Rit Xu as well as Chi­nese dancers Li Ruimin and Zheng Long will be streamed on the Gar­dens by the Bay web­site.</p>
