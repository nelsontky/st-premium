    <p>A man with dual cit­i­zen­ship who ear­lier pleaded guilty to de­fault­ing on his na­tional ser­vice (NS) obli­ga­tions has been sen­tenced to four months and three weeks in jail.</p>
    <p>Basil Lim Boon Hoh, 28, holds both Sin­ga­pore and Malaysian cit­i­zen­ships. The court heard that Lim – who is Sin­ga­porean by birth – was re­lo­cated to Malaysia when he was about a year old, but even­tu­ally re­turned to serve his NS in 2018.</p>
    <p>By then, he had de­faulted on his NS obli­ga­tions for al­most 10 years.</p>
    <p>Lim was sen­tenced based on two charges un­der the En­list­ment Act. Two other sim­i­lar charges were taken into ac­count in sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Lim had re­mained out­side of Sin­ga­pore without a valid exit per­mit for nine years, 11 months and 16 days.</p>
    <p>His mother is a Malaysian, while his father, with whom he is no longer in con­tact, is a Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>While Lim was granted Malaysian cit­i­zen­ship in 2001, his mother still ap­plied for a Sin­ga­pore NRIC on his be­half in 2007 be­cause she wanted him to have a choice in the fu­ture, court doc­u­ments state.</p>
    <p>Lim’s father in­formed him of his NS obli­ga­tions be­fore he turned 10, but his mother told him when he was 16 that he could ig­nore these obli­ga­tions as he had Malaysian cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>Two no­tices were sent in 2009 to a Malaysian ad­dress that Lim’s mother had pro­vided to the Min­istry of De­fence’s (Min­def) Cen­tral Man­power Base (CMPB).</p>
    <p>The no­tices re­quired him to regis­ter on­line for his NS, and in­formed him that he had to re­port to CMPB. Lim failed to do so on both counts.</p>
    <p>The court heard that dur­ing his time spent out­side Sin­ga­pore from 2009 to 2018, Lim had stud­ied in the United King­dom at the Im­pe­rial Col­lege Lon­don from 2010 to 2014, for a Mas­ter of Sci­ence de­gree spe­cial­is­ing in physics.</p>
    <p>Lim’s lawyer also wrote to CMPB in 2016, re­quest­ing that Lim be al­lowed to re­nounce his Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship. This re­quest was re­jected.</p>
    <p>Lim then re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in March 2018 and en­listed in Au­gust that year. He com­pleted his NS in Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Lim now wants to keep his Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship as he does not speak Malay well. He also in­tends to work here.</p>
    <p>At a prior hear­ing, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Sean Teh urged the court to jail Lim for five months and 18 days. DPP Teh ar­gued that Lim had re­ported to CMPB at his own tim­ing, and that his sur­ren­der was “tac­ti­cal and cal­cu­lated”, and not out of “gen­uine re­morse”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, de­fence lawyer Lim Kia Tong said in his mit­i­ga­tion plea that Lim’s mother had hid­den her son’s NS obli­ga­tions from him as she did not want him to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Lim will be­gin serv­ing his sen­tence to­mor­row, and is cur­rently out on $10,000 bail.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 15 NS de­fault­ers, in­clud­ing Lim, have been jailed since the High Court set out a sen­tenc­ing frame­work for such de­fault­ers in 2017.</p>
