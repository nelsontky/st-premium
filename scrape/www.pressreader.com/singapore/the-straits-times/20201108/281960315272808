    <p>When Covid-19 hit Sin­ga­pore, staff in the health­care pro­fes­sion swung into ac­tion, many of them vol­un­teer­ing to serve on the front lines of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Among them was Dr Ru­fus Daniel, 52, a fam­ily physi­cian and as­so­ciate con­sul­tant at Yishun Poly­clinic.</p>
    <p>He set up and ran a med­i­cal cen­tre in a mi­grant worker pur­pose­built dor­mi­tory at Kranji Lodge 1, and sub­se­quently moved on to work at one of the first ho­tels con­verted to a swab iso­la­tion fa­cil­ity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dr Daniel was among six poly­clinic health­care front-line staff who re­ceived the Na­tional Health­care Group Poly­clin­ics (NHGP) Covid-19 War­rior Award from Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In recog­ni­tion of their courage and ded­i­ca­tion in the fight against the coro­n­avirus, the awards were pre­sented at a vir­tual cer­e­mony of the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s 20th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>Themed “20 Years of Bet­ter Health­care To­gether”, the event also saw NHGP un­veil­ing Sin­ga­pore’s largest fab­ric photo mo­saic com­pris­ing 2,020 pho­tos con­trib­uted by its staff from the past 20 years.</p>
    <p>“I feel ex­tremely proud, for­tu­nate, and hum­bled to be re­ceiv­ing this award,” Dr Daniel said.</p>
    <p>Apart from com­ing up with ideas to im­prove the work­flow at the med­i­cal cen­tre, he went above and be­yond the call of duty through his ac­tions, in­clud­ing buy­ing briyani treats for some of his pa­tients and, on one oc­ca­sion, go­ing out of his way to help an anx­ious worker con­tact his wife in Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>“I’ve learnt so much from the peo­ple I came into con­tact with and worked with, and I’m thank­ful to my team for their hard work and com­mit­ment,” said Dr Daniel.</p>
    <p>An­other award re­cip­i­ent was Ms Tan Pek Hoon, 50, a se­nior nurse man­ager at Yishun Poly­clinic who was the nurs­ing lead for the Na­tional Health­care Group’s mass swab team.</p>
    <p>To­gether with her team, Ms Tan moved from site to site, read­ily vol­un­teer­ing to help with the swab­bing of big groups of for­eign work­ers, many of whom tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been a nurse for over 30 years – and I’ve been through Sars, and now Covid-19. I was happy to step up,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah noted that pri</p>
    <p>mary care played a crit­i­cal role in con­tain­ing the coro­n­avirus and keep­ing cit­i­zens safe and healthy.</p>
    <p>“I would like to com­mend the NHGP staff for the hard work and sac­ri­fices in sup­port of our na­tion’s fight against the pan­demic,” Madam Hal­imah said.</p>
    <p>“It is also en­cour­ag­ing to see that NHGP has turned the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion into an op­por­tu­nity by go­ing dig­i­tal and ex­pand­ing its tele­health ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah added that as a re­sult of these tele­health ser­vices, more pa­tients can now con­sult NHGP’s care teams safely and con­ve­niently from their homes, with more than 125,000 such ses­sions con­ducted across the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s six poly­clin­ics this year.</p>
    <p>The Tele-Di­etet­ics ser­vice, which was launched in March, en­abled pa­tients with chronic dis­eases to con­sult via tele­phone or</p>
    <p>video with NHGP’s di­eti­tians. Care­givers of pae­di­atric pa­tients with feed­ing and nu­tri­tional needs can also use the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Also launched this year was the Tele-Psy­chol­ogy ser­vice, which gives el­i­gi­ble pa­tients with ex­ist­ing psy­chol­o­gist re­view ap­point­ments the op­tion of a tele­phone con­sul­ta­tion. This al­lows psy­chol­o­gists to pro­vide cru­cial men­tal health sup­port and in­ter­ven­tion to pa­tients re­motely.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently, the Tele-Di­rect Ob­served Ther­apy ser­vice al­lows tu­ber­cu­lo­sis pa­tients to sub­sti­tute face-to-face vis­its to the poly­clinic with video con­sul­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme was pi­loted at the Yishun and Wood­lands poly­clin­ics in June. It was made avail­able at all other poly­clin­ics within the group last month.</p>
