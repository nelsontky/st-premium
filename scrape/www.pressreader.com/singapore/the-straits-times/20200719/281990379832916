    <p>SYD­NEY • Some beach­front homes on Aus­tralia’s east coast have started slip­ping into the sea af­ter wild storms lashed the coast­line, res­i­dents said.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of Wam­beral, about 90km north of Syd­ney, were evac­u­ated af­ter emer­gency per­son­nel warned that their homes might col­lapse as waves as high as 11m sped up ero­sion, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>The sub­urb has a pop­u­la­tion of about 6,300. Two prop­er­ties par­tially col­lapsed af­ter heavy ero­sion and a third suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant dam­age, the Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion (ABC) re­ported yes­ter­day. Other prop­erty own­ers have lost land right up to the edge of their houses.</p>
    <p>The Bureau of Me­te­o­rol­ogy said a haz­ardous surf warn­ing re­mained in place for much of the New South Wales coast yes­ter­day, with the risk of more dam­age to beaches. Con­di­tions are ex­pected to ease to­day.</p>
    <p>“We’re all so anx­ious and fright­ened and vul­ner­a­ble, and quite frankly an­gry that we’ve come to this sit­u­a­tion, which we knew was go­ing to hap­pen be­cause the revet­ment wall wasn’t built,” said Wam­beral res­i­dent Mar­garet Brice.</p>
    <p>Revet­ment walls are per­ma­nent struc­tures to pre­vent ero­sion of land that are placed on banks or cliffs. Plans to build one i n Wam­beral have been the sub­ject of com­mu­nity de­bate for a decade, ABC re­ported.</p>
    <p>ABC quoted Cen­tral Coast Council di­rec­tor of en­vi­ron­ment plan­ning, Mr Scott Cox, as say­ing the com­mu­nity was frus­trated but that he “can’t au­tho­rise peo­ple to do work with­out ap­proval”.</p>
    <p>“If res­i­dents with sound en­gi­neer­ing ad­vice need to do work to save their own home, council won’t be tak­ing any ac­tion against them.”</p>
    <p>The is­sue has af­fected the town since a storm in 1974, when houses along the fore­shore col­lapsed into the ocean, ABC said.</p>
    <p>Ms Brice said she was “dev­as­tated that we’ve now lost our pris­tine beach”, adding: “If those prop­er­ties are lost, the dunes are go­ing to be breached and the rest of Wam­beral is at threat.”</p>
