    <p>Newly ap­pointed Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong has stepped down from his role as vice-pres­i­dent of the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS), the na­tional foot­ball body an­nounced last night.</p>
    <p>In a me­dia state­ment, an FAS spokesman said Tong had given no­tice of his res­ig­na­tion from the FAS coun­cil and that the move was made “in con­nec­tion with his new ap­point­ment”.</p>
    <p>Tong, the Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Law and Health, will be sworn in to­day and will also be the Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, the FAS de­scribed him as an “in­te­gral mem­ber” of the six-man FAS exco and an “ex­em­plary am­bas­sador in the pro­mo­tion of foot­ball in Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Said its spokesman: “To­gether with (FAS pres­i­dent) Lim Kia Tong, he ini­ti­ated the re­brand­ing and re­vamp of the lo­cal pro­fes­sional league from the S-League to the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) in 2018, in­clud­ing es­tab­lish­ing the four pil­lars that the SPL is based on – as a pre­mium plat­form for as­pir­ing foot­ballers, pro­fes­sion­al­ism, sus­tain­abil­ity and a vi­brant foot­ball cul­ture.</p>
    <p>On top of that, he also headed the dig­i­tal push for the newly minted SPL, call­ing for free live stream­ing of matches to be avail­able to fur­ther en­hance en­gage­ment with lo­cal fans and com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Last Au­gust, Tong re­vealed to The Straits Times that the FAS had set a goal for the na­tional team to play in the 2034 World Cup, a goal he said was “re­al­is­tic”. The dec­la­ra­tion sparked mixed re­ac­tions from the lo­cal fra­ter­nity, with some ap­plaud­ing the high aim.</p>
    <p>Tong, 50, was ap­pointed FAS vice-pres­i­dent in Septem­ber 2013, and was re-elected in the same role in 2017. His cur­rent term was due to end next year. The FAS will only be re­quired to elect a re­place­ment at its next congress – as per its con­sti­tu­tion – which is slated to be held be­fore the year is up.</p>
    <p>Its other vice-pres­i­dents are S. Tha­vane­son, Teo Hock Seng and Razali Saad. Pres­i­dent Lim and deputy pres­i­dent Bernard Tan com­plete the FAS exco.</p>
    <p>Lim said of Tong, who had also been chair­man of the FAS le­gal com­mit­tee since 2017: “He was a valu­able mem­ber of the team and we could al­ways count on him for ad­vice and in­sight­ful per­spec­tives... but we are aware that he has a higher call­ing to an­swer to for the bet­ter­ment of our na­tion.</p>
    <p>“On be­half of all the FAS coun­cil mem­bers and staff, I would like to place on record our ut­most thanks and sin­cere grat­i­tude to Ed­win for all his con­tri­bu­tions to the or­gan­i­sa­tion over the past eight years.</p>
    <p>“We wish him all the best as he em­barks on the next chap­ter of his public ser­vice ca­reer.” he is, not who he was,” she said.</p>
    <p>Lim Heem Wei, one of Sin­ga­pore women’s artis­tic gymnastics na­tional coaches and mem­ber of the Safe Sport com­mis­sion, also vouched for Belt­man’s char­ac­ter dur­ing his time in the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old, who was Sin­ga­pore’s first Olympic gym­nast at Lon­don 2012, said: “Ger­rit has been a great source of mo­ti­va­tion for the coach­ing team. I’m glad and feel for­tu­nate to have him as my men­tor.</p>
    <p>“I no­ticed the ju­nior and se­nior gym­nasts in our na­tional train­ing cen­tre pro­gramme had be­come more ex­pres­sive, com­mu­nica­tive, and self mo­ti­vated since the ap­point­ment of Ger­rit as the head coach.”</p>
    <p>Ath­lete abuse be­came a trend­ing topic again this month fol­low­ing nu­mer­ous first-per­son ac­counts.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, former Sin­ga­pore na­tional fig­ure skater Yu Shu­ran re­vealed she was abused while train­ing in China. The 19-year-old said that from the age of 11, she had been hit re­peat­edly by her per­sonal coach, some­times with skat­ing blades that drew blood from her shins.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish and Aus­tralian gym­nasts also shared ac­counts of phys­i­cal, men­tal and emo­tional abuse in the sport fol­low­ing the re­cent re­lease of Amer­i­can doc­u­men­tary Ath­lete A, which charts in­ves­ti­ga­tions into former USA Gymnastics doc­tor Larry Nas­sar. The 56-year-old was jailed for life in 2018 af­ter abus­ing more than 250 ath­letes.</p>
