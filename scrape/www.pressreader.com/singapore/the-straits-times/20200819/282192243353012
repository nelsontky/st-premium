    <p>Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion Corp has re­ceived a no­tice of req­ui­si­tion from sub­stan­tial share­holder Oei Hong Leong seek­ing once again to re­move the com­pany’s founder Chew Hua Seng as chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei and his com­pany, Oei Hong Leong Art Mu­seum, sent the no­tice on Mon­day, re­quest­ing that the main­board-listed pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion provider con­vene an ex­traor­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) and ta­ble six res­o­lu­tions for share­hold­ers’ ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei held 12.2 per cent of Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion as at May 31, while Mr Chew owned 29.4 per cent, ac­cord­ing to ShareIn­vestor data.</p>
    <p>One of the res­o­lu­tions is for the re­moval of Mr Chew – in­clud­ing ter­mi­nat­ing his em­ploy­ment with Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion – from all his ap­point­ments with the com­pany, its sub­sidiaries and as­so­ciates.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei is also seek­ing to ap­point one of the in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tors as a non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man, or to have the board of di­rec­tors search for a suit­able can­di­date.</p>
    <p>In con­nec­tion with the place­ment of 95 mil­lion new shares is­sued and al­lot­ted on Oct 10, 2017, at 30 cents apiece, Mr Oei wants Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion to dis­close the iden­ti­ties of the placees and the num­ber of shares placed to each of them.</p>
    <p>The place­ment had di­luted the stake he and his com­pany held to 12.88 per cent, from 14.04 per cent.</p>
    <p>These three res­o­lu­tions are sub­stan­tially sim­i­lar to those in Mr Oei’s pre­vi­ous EGM req­ui­si­tion no­tice sent on Oct 12, 2017, when he ques­tioned that same place­ment.</p>
    <p>He sub­se­quently with­drew that no­tice in re­turn for an al­leged prom­ise by the CEO to pro­cure a buyer for his Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion shares.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mon­day’s no­tice, Mr Oei is also hop­ing for an in­de­pen­dent spe­cial au­di­tor to be ap­pointed to conduct a spe­cial au­dit on the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing the 2017 place­ment and the is­sue in April 2018 of some 318.2 mil­lion rights shares at 14 cents each.</p>
    <p>The other two res­o­lu­tions are to ap­point an in­de­pen­dent spe­cial au­di­tor to re­view the cir­cum­stances of all loans ex­tended by the CEO to the com­pany or its sub­sidiaries and the re­pay­ment thereof, as well as to re­view the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing a hand­writ­ten “con­fi­den­tial agree­ment” be­tween the two busi­ness­men dated Oct 16, 2017.</p>
    <p>In the agree­ment, Mr Chew al­legedly promised to pro­cure a buyer for the Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion shares held by Mr Oei at 44 cents a share, which was about 45 per cent higher than the stock’s trad­ing price at the time.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei also wants the in­de­pen­dent au­di­tor to in­ves­ti­gate any reg­u­la­tory com­pli­ance, cor­po­rate gov­er­nance and dis­clo­sure is­sues aris­ing from the hand­writ­ten agree­ment, in­clud­ing whether Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion had failed to an­nounce ma­te­ri­ally price-sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The bil­lion­aire had re­lied on this hand­writ­ten note to sue Mr Chew for al­legedly reneg­ing on his prom­ise to get a buyer for his shares.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, the High Court dis­missed the law­suit, as the judge found that the agree­ment – which in­volved a dis­cus­sion last­ing less than two min­utes – was not meant to be legally bind­ing.</p>
    <p>The Busi­ness Times un­der­stands that the Court of Ap­peal last Fri­day dis­missed Mr Oei’s ap­peal against the judg­ment.</p>
    <p>In its bourse fil­ing on Mon­day night, the com­pany said it is tak­ing le­gal ad­vice on the con­tents of the req­ui­si­tion no­tice.</p>
