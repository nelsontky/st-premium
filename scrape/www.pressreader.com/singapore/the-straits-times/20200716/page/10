He said: “It’s as important as the service and the cooking.”
Some of the group’s restaurant­s have also implemente­d time limits for diners to ensure that more customers can be served and staff have enough time to sanitise tables.
For example, The Market Grill has a limit of 11/ hours for each table. Customers are also encouraged to make reservatio­ns online.
Enterprise Singapore said in a statement last month that the agency had issued three compositio­n fines to F&B outlets since the start of phase two.
Two compositio­n fines of $1,000 were issued to restaurant­s for failing to implement safe distancing. One fine of $300 was issued to an employee of a food outlet for not wearing a mask when preparing food and taking orders.
Manager Frederick Tan, 38, said his family has been eating out about twice a week since the start of phase two.
The father of two said: “We try to go out on weekday nights when it is not too crowded and we make sure to sanitise our hands before eating.
“It’s been good to be able to get out of the house and seeing the safety measures taken by restaurant­s, we feel safe.” 2 melheng@sph.com.sg PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
