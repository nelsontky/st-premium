    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ro­main Gros­jean cred­ited the halo pro­tec­tion bar with sav­ing his life in a fiery crash that ripped his car in two on the open­ing lap of the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>His Haas car speared through the bar­ri­ers af­ter ca­reer­ing off the track at high speed, with the force of the im­pact split­ting the car in half and set­ting it aflame.</p>
    <p>In what was a “mir­a­cle es­cape”, the 34-year-old man­aged to clam­ber out and limp away from the wreck­age, mirac­u­lously es­cap­ing with only burns to his hands.</p>
    <p>“Hello ev­ery­one, just wanted to say I am okay, well sort of okay,” the French­man, his hand swad­dled in ban­dages, said with a smile from his hos­pi­tal bed in a video posted to so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t for the halo some years ago but I think it’s the great­est thing that we brought to For­mula One and with­out it, I wouldn’t be able to speak to you to­day.”</p>
    <p>For­mula One in­tro­duced the halo, a three-point ti­ta­nium struc­ture above the front of the cock­pit de­signed to pro­tect drivers’ heads from fly­ing de­bris, in 2018 and it ini­tially at­tracted con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>The de­vice was pro­posed and cre­ated af­ter the death of Jules Bianchi, who died in 2015 from head in­juries suf­fered in a crash at the 2014 Ja­panese Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Many had voiced their dis­dain when the in­tro­duc­tion of the halo was an­nounced, say­ing it al­tered the essence of the open-wheel se­ries. Mercedes team prin­ci­pal Toto Wolff said he wanted to “take it off with a chain­saw” as the halo was “not aes­thet­i­cally ap­peal­ing”.</p>
    <p>Gros­jean, who is out of con­tract and likely to leave For­mula One at the end of the year, was an­other of those against the safety de­vice, la­belling its in­tro­duc­tion as a “sad day” for the sport.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, his grat­i­tude for its ex­is­tence was echoed by others in the sport as F1 promised a full in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the fire­ball crash.</p>
    <p>The last time an F1 car split in two was at Monaco in 1991 and the last time one caught fire in a crash was at Imola in 1989.</p>
    <p>“There’s ab­so­lutely no doubt the halo was the fac­tor that saved the day and saved Ro­main,” Ross Brawn, F1 man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for mo­tor sports, said. “It was a life­saver to­day. Un­doubt­edly, we’ve got to do a very deep anal­y­sis of all the events that oc­curred be­cause there were a num­ber of things that shouldn’t have hap­pened. The fire was wor­ry­ing, the split of the bar­rier was wor­ry­ing. I think the pos­i­tives are the safety of the car and that’s what got us through to­day.”</p>
    <p>Brawn, who sus­pected the in­ci­dent was down to a rup­tured con­nec­tion, added that bar­ri­ers split­ting was a prob­lem from F1’s far more dan­ger­ous past “and nor­mally, it re­sulted in a fa­tal­ity”.</p>
    <p>Record seven-time cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton, the race win­ner for Mercedes, was just thank­ful the halo had worked and also hailed the swift re­sponse of mar­shals and the med­i­cal car team.</p>
    <p>“I’m grate­ful the bar­rier didn’t slice his head up or some­thing like that. It could have been so much worse,” said the Bri­ton.</p>
    <p>Red Bull team boss Chris­tian Horner agreed: “Hor­ren­dous. An in­ci­dent like that, I couldn’t see a driver com­ing out of that.</p>
    <p>“All credit to the FIA. For a car to pierce a steel bar­rier like that and for the driver to sur­vive, with the fire and ev­ery­thing else, it’s all credit to the job that they’re do­ing. Ro­main Gros­jean is a very, very for­tu­nate young man tonight.”</p>
    <p>Max Ver­stap­pen and his Red Bull team­mate Alex Al­bon, who prof­ited af­ter an en­gine fail­ure forced Rac­ing Point’s Ser­gio Perez to re­tire with three laps left, fin­ished se­cond and third re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Gros­jean will sit out this week­end’s Sakhir Grand Prix, which is also at the Bahrain In­ter­na­tional Cir­cuit. Brazil­ian driver Pi­etro Fit­ti­paldi – grand­son of two-time world cham­pion Emer­son Fit­ti­paldi – will make his F1 de­but in his place.</p>
