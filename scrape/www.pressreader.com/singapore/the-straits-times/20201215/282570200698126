    <p>A two- to four-night cruise to nowhere can be breezed through fairly quickly.</p>
    <p>There are no grind­ing, crunch­ing chains when the ship drops an­chor in the mid­dle of the night as it slips into safe haven – an an­noy­ing sleep dis­rup­tion to any pas­sen­ger at the ship’s fore.</p>
    <p>There is no mad scram­ble for land ex­cur­sions.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, med­i­cal sit­u­a­tions can be read­ily han­dled since ports are al­most within sight. This tran­spired just last week when the Quan­tum of the Seas cruise ship sailed back to Singapore be­cause of a sus­pected Covid-19 case on board, though that turned out to be a false alarm.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have cruised a dozen times. The short­est was a week­end get­away to nowhere and the long­est was a 22-night po­lar dive ex­pe­di­tion to Antarc­tica.</p>
    <p>Amid the waves, sea spray and oc­ca­sional pesky bird drop­pings, here are some lessons learnt and tips to make a cruise ex­pe­ri­ence bet­ter.</p>
    <p>CHECK THE WEATHER AND TIME YOUR TRIP</p>
    <p>Short-trip­pers may end up tak­ing a cruise on im­pulse or wrap their get­aways around their time-off win­dows. Most ig­nore the weather.</p>
    <p>I plan my cruises around weather fore­casts and sea­sons. A cruise is less en­joy­able when the days are con­tin­u­ously bathed in seven shades of grey.</p>
    <p>“I will not cruise to be cooped up in the cabin or in­doors. It is strange to wear a bikini in the rain, by the pool,” quips 35-year-old bank ex­ec­u­tive Tina Lim. The seven-cruise vet­eran, who packs half a dozen swim­suits for her so­journs, checks the weather re­li­giously be­fore nail­ing down a cruise date.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, dur­ing bad weather, cer­tain out­door fa­cil­i­ties or ac­tiv­i­ties are cur­tailed for safety and prac­ti­cal rea­sons. Fam­i­lies with kids may be less both­ered by this as they can re­sort to more mun­dane indoor fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Photo buffs best un­der­stand the con­di­tions re­quired to get images of a molten sun amid crim­son skies or sparkling city lights at the per­fect blue hour.</p>
    <p>Thus, if time is flex­i­ble, avoid sail­ing on days when there is ex­tended bad weather on the radar. We are now en­ter­ing into the wettest months of the mon­soon sea­son, in­ci­den­tally.</p>
    <p>Pro tips: •</p>
    <p>Time a cruise around key dates. For ex­am­ple, pas­sen­gers trav­el­ling dur­ing New Year’s Eve will be treated to stun­ning fire­works. Ships world­wide fire flares and blast air horns to wel­come the New Year. Valen­tine’s Day cruises are al­ways pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>• Full-moon sail­ings of­fer shim­mer­ing seas, which add that sprin­kle of ro­mance to a cruise.</p>
    <p>• Let the book­ing agent know if it is a spe­cial oc­ca­sion or cel­e­bra­tion – a birthday cake or a bot­tle of sparkling wine may be wait­ing in the cabin. Honey­moon­ers might snag a cabin up­grade.</p>
    <p>TWO FLOAT­ING HO­TELS, BRIM­MING WITH FA­CIL­I­TIES ON STEROIDS</p>
    <p>The two ships cur­rently op­er­at­ing out of Singapore are Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional’s Quan­tum of the Seas and Dream Cruises’ World Dream. Both mega-ships are among the world’s largest – with an over­all length match­ing an Amer­i­can nu­clear air­craft car­rier. And they are tiered like wed­ding cakes that spill over with in­no­va­tive fea­tures and fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For­get ping-pong ta­bles, old­school games ar­cades or kids’ face­paint­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Quan­tum of the Seas takes it to the next level with its cher­ryp­icker-style ob­ser­va­tion cap­sule, ro­botic bar­tenders, bumper car hall, sky-div­ing and surf­ing stim­u­la­tors, among oth­ers. And you are un­likely to eat your way through all its 14 res­tau­rants in the span of three or four nights.</p>
    <p>World Dream of­fers a ritzy ho­tel within a ho­tel for those will­ing to pay more. It is big on game stim­u­la­tors, vir­tual re­al­ity and mo­tion the­atres – think Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios and you get an idea. It boasts an ar­ray of 35 din­ing op­tions and bars.</p>
    <p>For both ships, some din­ing out­lets are in­clu­sive while the spe­cial­ity ones re­quire pay­ment. The same ap­plies to se­lected ac­tiv­i­ties as well.</p>
    <p>Pro tips:</p>
    <p>• De­cide on the fa­cil­i­ties that ap­peal to you. Some re­quire more phys­i­cal par­tic­i­pa­tion, while oth­ers are more docile yet al­low younger kids to scream their heads off.</p>
    <p>• Take along your own Dom Perignon or Grand Cru for a spe­cial can­dle­light din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>THE CABIN AND DECK PLANS</p>
    <p>“My win­dow view is 80 per cent blocked by an orange lifeboat dan­gling from the ceil­ing.”</p>
    <p>That lament from a fel­low cruise pas­sen­ger was her in­tro­duc­tory line, when we ex­changed pleas­antries dur­ing an In­ner Pas­sage Alaska cruise a few years back. She pleaded un­suc­cess­fully to change the cabin with the ho­tel man­ager.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers on short cruises may be more for­giv­ing if they land in a badly lo­cated cabin. If a choice is avail­able, make an ef­fort to go through the deck plans and lay­outs.</p>
    <p>Pro tips:</p>
    <p>• If grandma is join­ing the trip, pick a cabin nearer the lifts or on the din­ing-room deck.</p>
    <p>• Cruises to nowhere do not face gale-force winds or tow­er­ing waves. So, the higher the deck, the more ma­jes­tic the view. In rough open seas, mid-ship lower decks are bet­ter.</p>
    <p>• The sys­tem gen­er­ates the cabin al­lot­ment. Check prices on­line, but also speak to the book­ing agent to as­sist on cabin op­tions. It is dif­fi­cult or costly to make changes once the sys­tem al­lo­cates the cabin.</p>
    <p>THE CREW MAKES OR BREAKS THE CRUISE EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>The soft­ware of a cruise ship? The crew. And it is of­ten over­looked.</p>
    <p>Be it a short or long cruise, I al­ways make it a point to know my cabin stew­ard, the wait­ress at my favourite sec­tion of the din­ing hall, the bar­tender, the ho­tel man­ager and the pool deck hand.</p>
    <p>Th­ese new friends can make the next few days smoother sail­ing. Some words in Ta­ga­log will go a long way – the Fil­ipinos are mas­ters in hos­pi­tal­ity and are well rep­re­sented on ships.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tant, per­haps, is the maitre d’. He or she de­cides the seat­ing ar­range­ments. It may mean ei­ther a ro­man­tic ta­ble by the win­dow or a ta­ble hemmed in by two noisy fam­i­lies. The cap­tain is king, but he is far too dis­tant.</p>
    <p>Pro tips:</p>
    <p>• De­cide on the din­ing op­tions be­fore board­ing. The crew is al­ways more re­laxed and at­ten­tive dur­ing the last seat­ing, but you may be late for the evening show­times.</p>
    <p>• Once on board, I make a bee­line to my se­lected spe­cial­ity res­tau­rants soon­est to par­lay my re­quests. Talk to the crew man­ning the pop­u­lar fa­cil­i­ties and seek their ad­vice on the best tim­ings or the best van­tage point for pho­tog­ra­phy. Be nice but be real.</p>
    <p>GRA­TU­ITIES: AN IM­POR­TANT PART OF IN­COME</p>
    <p>Both ships slap around 15 per cent ser­vice charge on the cabin prices a per­son. This is a fair ar­range­ment, given that tips are in­te­gral to the crew’s in­come – pro­vided that it is not some sin­is­ter scheme by the man­age­ment to boost rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“With cruise gra­tu­ities au­to­mat­i­cally charged, both our front-line and be­hind-the-scene crew mem­bers who play a cru­cial role in cre­at­ing guest ex­pe­ri­ences will be equally re­warded and recog­nised,” says Mr Michael Goh, pres­i­dent of Dream Cruises and head of in­ter­na­tional sales, Gent­ing Cruise Lines, in re­sponse to queries.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger S.H. Raja, who has cruised be­tween Asean ports, such as in Malaysia and Viet­nam, and Far East ones in Ja­pan, China and Tai­wan, says: “Up­front gra­tu­ities elim­i­nate the in­stances of pas­sen­gers who do not un­der­stand the stan­dard eti­quette. Some pas­sen­gers are tight-fisted and treat tip­ping as get­ting rid of loose change in the wal­let.”</p>
    <p>And in th­ese pan­demic times, the crew works dou­bly hard. More clean­ing, more care and more at­ten­tive­ness. The hours are longer and harder now. And the cap on pas­sen­gers shrinks the tip pool. Thus, show more grat­i­tude.</p>
    <p>Pro tips:</p>
    <p>• Recog­nise ex­cep­tional ser­vice with a fur­ther tip, even if the gra­tu­ities are pre-paid. I make a men­tal note of the waiter who re­mem­bers my weak­ness for desserts and qui­etly pro­vides dou­ble help­ings; my chirpy stew­ard who cleans the cabin spot­lessly and slips ex­tra choco­lates on the bed dur­ing turn-down ser­vice; the restau­rant man­ager’s at­ten­tive but un­ob­tru­sive ser­vice; the mixol­o­gist who makes ex­cel­lent cock­tails; the deck hand help­ing to re­serve my favourite shaded spot by the pool.</p>
    <p>• Tip only in the lo­cal cur­rency or in ma­jor cur­ren­cies such as US dol­lars and eu­ros. Get­ting rid of the spare renminbi or ru­piah is not sin­cere.</p>
    <p>• With the cur­rent pan­demic, the health and safety cul­ture has been rewrit­ten for both pas­sen­gers and crew. The re­cent Covid-19 false alarm aboard Quan­tum of the Seas has sharp­ened the learn­ing curve for the cruise in­dus­try. More im­por­tantly, it demon­strated that the pi­lot cruise pro­gramme has a ro­bust, ef­fi­cient health-re­sponse sys­tem in place. For those yearn­ing for a “cruise­ca­tion”, sail­ing at half the max­i­mum ca­pac­ity is a big draw. With seven crew mem­bers for ev­ery 10 pas­sen­gers, this is an al­most un­prece­dented level of care and at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>And at slightly more than $300 a night, with full board for two per­sons plus en­ter­tain­ment, that is a pretty good deal.</p>

    <p>The writer’s most re­cent cruise was a 22-night ex­pe­di­tion to Antarc­tica in March. He was po­lar-div­ing with leop­ard seals be­tween ice­bergs. Dur­ing the cruise, he vis­ited the ship’s clinic twice for fever. He shared his aged rum gen­er­ously with the doc­tor, ho­tel man­ager and ex­pe­di­tion leader.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Antarc&#xAD;tica cruises may be out of the ques&#xAD;tion for now. But with the Singapore cruises sail&#xAD;ing at half of its max&#xAD;i&#xAD;mum ca&#xAD;pac&#xAD;ity, there are al&#xAD;most seven crew mem&#xAD;bers for ev&#xAD;ery 10 pas&#xAD;sen&#xAD;gers &#x2013; an un&#xAD;prece&#xAD;dented level of ser&#xAD;vice at&#xAD;ten&#xAD;tion.</p>
