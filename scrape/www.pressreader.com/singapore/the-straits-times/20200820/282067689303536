    <p>Un­der a new ini­tia­tive pro­mot­ing in­clu­siv­ity in the work­place and so­ci­ety, se­cu­rity ser­vices provider Cer­tis has hired two peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties as call cen­tre op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>The Cer­tis ini­tia­tive, called Break­ing Bar­ri­ers, will be done in part­ner­ship with lo­cal dis­abil­ity-fo­cused char­ity SPD, the firm said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cer­tis will also con­duct dis­abil­ity aware­ness train­ing for its se­cu­rity per­son­nel, so they can bet­ter sup­port per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties while on the job.</p>
    <p>All trainees will learn how to use as­sis­tive tech­nol­ogy, such as tac­tile guides, mo­bil­ity and hear­ing aids, that can sup­port peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, among other skills.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also launch­ing a se­ries of vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties over the next six months to boost the men­tal and phys­i­cal well-be­ing of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, such as light fit­ness work­outs, art and craft classes and mu­sic ses­sions. Cer­tis em­ploy­ees around the world will be able to be­friend and en­gage SPD ben­e­fi­cia­ries through these ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Cer­tis will also be do­nat­ing $20,000 to SPD to sup­port the char­ity amid tough times be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>The two new em­ploy­ees with dis­abil­i­ties are Mr Zim Loo Poh Thye, 53, and Ms J. P. Thanu­mad­hya, 27, who be­gan work­ing with Cer­tis’ In­te­grated Quar­an­tine Op­er­a­tions Ser­vices last month.</p>
    <p>They work four days a week on a 12-hour shift each time.</p>
    <p>Both were matched to their jobs by SPD’s em­ploy­ment sup­port spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>Their jobs in­clude call­ing those un­der quar­an­tine to check on their tem­per­a­ture and well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo, who was let go from his part-time job as a ful­fil­ment packer in April after his com­pany’s sales suf­fered due to the out­break, said he was “very happy” when he got the job with Cer­tis.</p>
    <p>“This is a very mean­ing­ful job and I can con­trib­ute to so­ci­ety in­stead of stay­ing at home,” said Mr Loo, who suf­fered a stroke in 2017 that af­fected the left side of his body. While he has mostly re­cov­ered, the fine mo­tions of his fin­gers are still af­fected.</p>
    <p>“It is very dif­fi­cult for a per­son with dis­abil­ity to find a job. I went for a few in­ter­views, but when they found out I was a stroke pa­tient, they wouldn’t call me back,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Thanu­mad­hya agreed that the job mar­ket for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties was tough.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a fall from a height caused mul­ti­ple frac­tures in her spine, pelvis and an­kles. She is now un­able to stand for long pe­ri­ods of time.</p>
    <p>“I feel so thank­ful and grate­ful that I have a job. All this while I’ve been sur­viv­ing with my par­ents’ sup­port, now I can sup­port my­self,” said Ms Thanu­mad­hya, who had been job hunt­ing since the start of the year.</p>
    <p>“I hope there will be more op­por­tu­ni­ties for other per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties to have jobs,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Toi Chia, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent and head of group hu­man re­sources, cor­po­rate plan­ning, and group com­mu­ni­ca­tions and mar­ket­ing at Cer­tis, said: “Through (this) ini­tia­tive, we seek to con­tinue to make a pos­i­tive im­pact in the com­mu­nity by spread­ing hope and cheer to help those in need, and build­ing an in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>SPD chief ex­ec­u­tive Ab­hi­manyau Pal said: “Char­i­ties have al­ways re­lied on the sup­port of cor­po­rates and in­di­vid­u­als... We hope to see more com­pa­nies like Cer­tis com­ing for­ward to help en­sure that per­sons with spe­cial needs in our com­mu­nity con­tinue to be sup­ported and are cared for dur­ing this tough time.”</p>
