    <p>Com­pa­nies need to do their part and help pro­vide at­tach­ments and trainee­ships for re­trenched work­ers amid the Covid-19 out­break, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shanmugara­tnam.</p>
    <p>On its part, the Gov­ern­ment will be gen­er­ous in sup­port­ing the ef­forts of these busi­nesses, he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at DBS Bank’s Asian In­sights Con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Mr Thar­man said that the chal­lenge of keep­ing Sin­ga­pore’s un­em­ploy­ment fig­ures down will “grow in the months to come”, even as the Repub­lic has so far kept the job­less rate rel­a­tively low.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies have to play ball,” he said, adding that the Gov­ern­ment will pro­vide “sig­nif­i­cant help” to firms that do so.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to be gen­er­ous in do­ing that, and ef­fec­tively, the state will pay for a good part of the wages or al­lowances of those who have these trainee­ships and at­tach­ments.”</p>
    <p>He also said per­ma­nent jobs will be in short sup­ply so “we have to find ways of giv­ing them at­tach­ments and trainee­ships”.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man chairs the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil, which over­sees the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age an­nounced in May. The ini­tia­tives are part of ef­forts to sup­port close to 100,000 job seek­ers this year by cre­at­ing new po­si­tions, trainee­ships and skills train­ing places.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also work with com­pa­nies to help them bring for­ward their hir­ing plans.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said com­pa­nies that are still grow­ing are un­sure of when to start hir­ing, given that the pan­demic has brought about much un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Firms, how­ever, know they will ul­ti­mately need to hire more peo­ple to grow their busi­ness, and the Gov­ern­ment’s role is to “help them to bring for­ward hir­ing to to­day, this year and next year”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man, who is also Co­ordi</p>
    <p>GEN­ER­OUS SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>We’re go­ing to be gen­er­ous ... and ef­fec­tively, the state will pay for a good part of the wages or al­lowances of those who have these trainee­ships and</p>
    <p>’’ at­tach­ments.</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER THAR­MAN SHANMUGARA­TNAM, on how the Gov­ern­ment will pro­vide “sig­nif­i­cant help” to firms that do their part to help re­trenched work­ers amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies, was speak­ing at a di­a­logue on the first day of the on­line con­fer­ence, which ends to­day.</p>
    <p>The event fea­tured a panel dis­cus­sion with for­mer Re­serve Bank of In­dia gov­er­nor Raghu­ram G. Ra­jan and mod­er­ated by DBS chief econ­o­mist Taimur Baig.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the di­a­logue, Mr Thar­man warned of the de­bil­i­tat­ing ef­fects of un­em­ploy­ment, and said the econ­omy will col­lec­tively lose skills if large num­bers of peo­ple are un­em­ployed for long. “We are not go­ing to be able to get back bet­ter... and not go­ing to be able to come out of Covid-19 in a bet­ter state. So we’ve got to bring for­ward hir­ing.”</p>
    <p>Pro­longed un­em­ploy­ment will also put a strain on the psy­che of work­ers who were made re­dun­dant, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to sav­ing jobs first is not unique, he said, adding that sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries are go­ing the same way.</p>
    <p>In the first phase of the cri­sis, gov­ern­ments have helped firms to “keep work­ers where they can, even if it’s pre­serv­ing jobs which may not be rel­e­vant two or three years from now”, he said.</p>
    <p>If they did not do so, states would have had to pro­vide sup­port to the un­em­ployed, so it is bet­ter to sub</p>
    <p>sidise jobs, he added.</p>
    <p>On the at­tach­ments and trainee­ships the Gov­ern­ment is work­ing ag­gres­sively to pro­mote, Mr Thar­man said match­ing will be done as much as pos­si­ble to en­sure work­ers are put in roles where they can use their ex­ist­ing skills.</p>
    <p>“So, they keep ac­cu­mu­lat­ing skills,” he said, even if work­ers’ place­ments “may not be with the same type of firm or ex­actly the same in­dus­try, it may be an ad­ja­cent in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>“Never un­der­es­ti­mate the way in which pre­vi­ous skills and old skills are rel­e­vant to the fu­ture. They’re al­ways rel­e­vant,” Mr Thar­man added.</p>
    <p>And it is al­ways rel­e­vant to find a way to help work­ers ac­cu­mu­late skills, for them to “move from a trainee­ship or an at­tach­ment into a new per­ma­nent job, brim­ming with con­fi­dence”, he said.</p>
    <p>Mo­men­tum is be­ing cre­ated by in­dus­try lead­ers such as DBS and Google, Mr Thar­man said.</p>
    <p>“One role of gov­ern­ments is to work with in­dus­try lead­ers to bring oth­ers along... If we work in con­cert with in­dus­tries, small firms and big firms, for­eign and lo­cal, you’re more likely to get the small firms com­ing along.</p>
    <p>“It’s also about the trust in the sys­tem. Be­cause if com­pa­nies know that oth­ers are go­ing to play the game, they are more will­ing to play the game, and every com­pany ends up bet­ter off.</p>
    <p>“The whole cor­po­rate sec­tor is go­ing to have to col­lab­o­rate with us on this – keep­ing peo­ple en­gaged at work, keep­ing them on a path of ac­cu­mu­lat­ing skills.”</p>
