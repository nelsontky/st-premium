    <p>The Sin­ga­porean worker. Highly ed­u­cated, cos­mopoli­tan, bilin­gual and hard-work­ing.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment they re­tain this com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage in the global econ­omy, say re­cruiters, em­ploy­ers and mem­bers of busi­ness cham­bers. But with the global econ­omy reach­ing a turn­ing point, this ad­van­tage could also be quickly eroded.</p>
    <p>That is, if the Sin­ga­pore worker re­mains un­will­ing to gain more in­ter­na­tional ex­po­sure, to de­velop more cre­ative and un­ortho­dox ways of do­ing things, and to learn to take on more risks, they warn.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises pres­i­dent Kurt Wee notes that Sin­ga­pore­ans have come a long way since 1980, when found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew high­lighted signs of “soft­en­ing” in the work­force in an in­dus­tri­al­is­ing econ­omy, based on em­ployer feed­back.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore work­ers, the late Mr Lee said back then, lack qual­ity con­scious­ness, are not in­ter­ested in what hap­pens out­side their im­me­di­ate area of job re­spon­si­bil­ity, and take no ini­tia­tive to safe­guard the firm’s in­ter­ests, which could threaten the coun­try’s re­struc­tur­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Since then, Mr Wee points out, the coun­try has suc­cess­fully groomed and built up man­age­rial and op­er­a­tional tal­ent such that it can com­pete on the global stage, with a work­force trusted by the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“We are able to look at pro­cesses and work within de­part­men­tal reg­i­mens, and get things done with com­pli­ance, rather than hap­haz­ardly – there is a level of so­phis­ti­ca­tion,” he adds.</p>
    <p>PLUS POINTS</p>
    <p>A good com­mand of the English lan­guage and the abil­ity to adapt cul­tur­ally have also been Sin­ga­porean worker strengths, says Mr Christo­pher Quek, man­ag­ing part­ner of ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Trive.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional firms here have also told him that they have found Sin­ga­pore­ans to be open-minded and will­ing to work with for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>“This open­ness is a sell­ing point. Other na­tions, in com­par­i­son, have their own in­nate na­tional cul­tural bias, which makes it hard for them to in­te­grate an in­ter­na­tional cul­ture,” adds Mr Quek.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce chief ex­ec­u­tive Vic­tor Mills says many Sin­ga­porean pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) also have core life skills val­ued by em­ploy­ers: they have a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude, are ready to adapt to learn, are en­gaged in their work and care about con­sis­tently pro­duc­ing qual­ity out­put.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the prob­lem for our econ­omy and com­pa­nies is that there are far too many who do not have th­ese core life skills, which holds them back,” he adds.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEEDED NOW</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, who have been armed with hard skills by the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, need more as­sis­tance with soft skills – in­clud­ing cre­ativ­ity and a risk-tak­ing mind­set – to re­tain their edge, em­ploy­ers say.</p>
    <p>One short­com­ing that al­most all in­ter­viewed cite is Sin­ga­porean work­ers’ hes­i­tance to ac­cept over­seas post­ings and gain ex­po­sure abroad, which means that they are seen as be­ing less mo­bile than their in­ter­na­tional coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>“Another price we pay for our coun­try’s suc­cess is that it has be­come too much of a com­fort zone for too many,” says Mr Mills.</p>
    <p>This, says Mr Ho Meng Kit, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion, could hin­der the ca­reer pro­gres­sion of work­ers as many multi­na­tional com­pa­nies re­quire them to have taken over­seas post­ings to be el­i­gi­ble for a high­level global or re­gional role.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s PMETs tend to go af­ter big cor­po­rate jobs, which they see as a guar­an­tee of a se­cure fu­ture or bet­ter pay prospects, they should also be more open to switch­ing ca­reers and pur­su­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in new growth sec­tors such as tech­nol­ogy or even start-ups, says Mr Am­rin Amin, strate­gic direc­tor of PBA Robotics.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, we have a promis­ing start-up ecosys­tem, but that full po­ten­tial is not yet re­alised,” he adds.</p>
    <p>TSMP Law joint man­ag­ing part­ner Stefanie Yuen-Thio be­lieves that even though changes are hap­pen­ing, the struc­ture of the grades­fo­cused ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem needs to evolve faster to en­sure soft skills are not marginalis­ed.</p>
    <p>“Our sys­tem churns out math ge­niuses, not prob­lem-solvers. That, if any­thing, is our new stum­bling block,” she main­tains.</p>
    <p>She re­calls how she had to read 20 cases a week for a sub­ject when she was a law stu­dent in Sin­ga­pore, while friends study­ing law in the United King­dom read about five a week.</p>
    <p>“They could get much deeper into anal­y­sis and prob­lem-solv­ing, whereas Sin­ga­pore stu­dents would be grap­pling just to ab­sorb all the data. This does not build up crit­i­cal think­ing. That is chang­ing but needs to pivot faster,” she says.</p>
    <p>The em­pha­sis on grades in so­ci­ety also breeds a “cer­tain en­ti­tle­ment men­tal­ity” among work­ers, adds Ms Yuen-Thio.</p>
    <p>“(It is) as if the sys­tem in­cul­cates an at­ti­tude that ‘if I work this hard in school and score this grade, I should do this well in life’,” she notes. “That’s a dan­ger­ous mind­set to take through life, es­pe­cially in a world where... (there is) a hugely ac­cel­er­ated rate of change.”</p>
    <p>That be­ing said, Mr Quek sees en­cour­ag­ing pol­icy de­vel­op­ments tar­geted at plug­ging the soft-skill gap, with in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing pro­vid­ing global in­tern­ship of­fer­ings, and giv­ing stu­dents flex­i­bil­ity in leave of ab­sence to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>More should be done, he says. For in­stance, in­dus­try prac­ti­tion­ers and thought lead­ers – par­tic­u­larly ex­pe­ri­enced for­eign­ers and Sin­ga­pore­ans with global ex­pe­ri­ence – can men­tor stu­dents and take charge of core ed­u­ca­tion mod­ules.</p>
    <p>Con­tin­u­ous up­grad­ing is also im­por­tant, says Sin­ga­porean-Ger­man Cham­ber of In­dus­try and Com­merce ad­vi­sory coun­cil mem­ber Alexan­der Melch­ers.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers here should take the ini­tia­tive to lead vo­ca­tional train­ing ef­forts, as in Ger­many and Switzer­land, he says. There, in­dus­tries come to­gether to iden­tify train­ing gaps and con­tract out train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions, which has helped their economies stay com­pet­i­tive, he notes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in Sin­ga­pore, this is the other way round, says Mr Melch­ers. “The ini­tia­tive for vo­ca­tional train­ing comes from ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions, and then they try to get com­pa­nies to join. That’s more dif­fi­cult to do.”</p>
    <p>(It is) as if the sys­tem in­cul­cates an at­ti­tude that ‘if I work this hard in school and score this grade, I should do this well in life’. That’s a dan­ger­ous mind­set to take through life, es­pe­cially in a world where... (there is) a hugely ac­cel­er­ated rate of change.</p>
