    <p>The num­ber of pri­vate non-landed homes resold hit a two-year high last month, while prices firmed slightly in what ob­servers see as an­other sign of the Sin­ga­pore prop­erty market’s grow­ing re­cov­ery from the ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic. An es­ti­mated 1,052 resale con­do­mini­ums and apart­ments changed hands last month – up 7 per cent from July and 36.3 per cent higher than in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of pri­vate non-landed homes resold hit a two-year high last month while prices firmed slightly in what ob­servers see as an­other sign of the Sin­ga­pore prop­erty market’s grow­ing re­cov­ery from the ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 1,052 resale con­do­mini­ums and apart­ments changed hands last month – up 7 per cent from July and 36.3 per cent higher than in Au­gust last year, ac­cord­ing to flash fig­ures from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous high­est vol­ume was achieved in July 2018 – the month when prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures were an­nounced – when 1,100 units were sold.</p>
    <p>The strong de­mand from HDB up­graders showed in the transactio­ns of mass market homes in the out­side cen­tral re­gion (OCR), which ac­counted for nearly 60 per cent of Au­gust’s resale transactio­ns. As in July, this group of buy­ers en­tered the pri­vate resale market in greater num­bers when many flats be­came el­i­gi­ble for resale fol­low­ing their fiveyear min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said Au­gust’s stel­lar re­sales of pri­vate homes seem to be in tan­dem with the pos­i­tive sales trends ob­served in other market seg­ments.</p>
    <p>Last week’s SRX flash es­ti­mate for Au­gust’s HDB resale vol­ume showed a sim­i­larly strong level of de­mand, with more than 2,400 HDB resale flats trans­acted for a third con­sec­u­tive month. HDB’s Build-To-Or­der sales launches in a num­ber of hous­ing es­tates in Au­gust were also over­sub­scribed many times.</p>
    <p>Based on the lat­est URA caveat data, new home sales, ex­clud­ing ex­ec­u­tive con­do­mini­ums, or ECs, also hit more than 1,200 units in Au­gust dur­ing the Hun­gry Ghost Month. This is the high­est sales achieved over the last 12 months.</p>
    <p>The strong hous­ing de­mand across the dif­fer­ent market seg­ments in­di­cates that Sin­ga­pore’s prop­erty market could be show­ing some “early signs of re­cov­ery”, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty sales plunged dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when no hous­ing view­ings were al­lowed and all showflats were closed.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate re­sales be­gan to re­bound in July with pent-up de­mand and HDB up­graders nearly dou­bled transactio­ns to 978 units resold from 496 units in June.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Sun: “For many Sin­ga­pore­ans, res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties may still be a ‘safer bet’, es­pe­cially for in­vestors who are look­ing for sta­ble re­turns dur­ing times of un­cer­tainty. The market ex­u­ber­ance from the pri­mary market may have also spread to the sec­ondary market as op­por­tunis­tic buy­ers are cur­rently on the look-out for un­der-val­ued resale prop­er­ties in the market.</p>
    <p>“With more than 5,000 resale con­dos sold in the first eight months of 2020, based on SRX data, we ex­pect to­tal resale vol­ume to likely reach 7,500 to 8,000 units this year – a tad lower than the 8,949 units resold in 2019, but still a very re­spectable num­ber in view of the mas­sive dis­rup­tion from the pan­demic,” she said.</p>
    <p>De­spite the rise in de­mand, resale condo prices in Au­gust re­mained largely sta­ble, inch­ing up by 0.4 per cent from July, and by the same amount over the same month last year.</p>
    <p>Both the core cen­tral re­gion (CCR) and rest of cen­tral re­gion (RCR) saw a mar­ginal resale price in­crease of 0.3 per cent month on month, while the OCR – which is sup­ported by a larger pool of buy­ers – en­joyed a slightly higher 0.5 per cent rise.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Mak, ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy, said the sta­ble price in­dex and ex­pand­ing resale vol­ume in Au­gust in­di­cate that sellers were not cut­ting prices sig­nif­i­cantly to sell their prop­er­ties. At the same time, some homebuyers were de­fy­ing the Hun­gry Ghost Month, which be­gan in the third week of Au­gust, to seal prop­erty deals.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of re­search and con­tent at PropNex Realty, said she ex­pects pri­vate resale prices to be rel­a­tively flat in the com­ing months, as the gloomy eco­nomic prospects and muted sen­ti­ment weigh on sellers’ abil­ity to raise ask­ing prices sub­stan­tially.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, buy­ers are likely to be cau­tious and pru­dent in their pur­chases, mind­ful of po­ten­tial down­side risks ahead, in­clud­ing the weaker hir­ing market, she said.</p>
