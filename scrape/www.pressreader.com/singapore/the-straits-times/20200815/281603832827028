    <p>Cul­tural bi­ases evolved to help hu­man tribes dis­tin­guish quickly be­tween kin and foe. To­day, such im­plicit (or un­con­scious) bias can add up to struc­tural ob­sta­cles for mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties. It is time to face up to our own im­plicit bias on race, says Pro­fes­sor Chong Siow Ann.</p>
    <p>The killing of African Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd by a white po­lice­man in Min­neapo­lis and the sub­se­quent Black Lives Mat­ter protests res­ur­rected an in­terred per­sonal in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Years ago, I was in the city of Philadel­phia for the an­nual Amer­i­can Psy­chi­atric As­so­ci­a­tion meet­ing, which at­tracted ev­ery morn­ing a rau­cous crowd of ban­ner-wav­ing and whis­tle-blow­ing anti-psy­chi­a­try pro­test­ers out­side the con­fer­ence venue.</p>
    <p>On the morn­ing of the third day, I left the ho­tel at an ear­lier hour to at­tend the first meet­ing of the day, but mainly to beat the demon­stra­tors to the venue.</p>
    <p>It was a cold morn­ing, and the streets were quiet. Round­ing the cor­ner on an even qui­eter street, I saw, walk­ing fast to­wards me on the same side of a pave­ment fis­sured with cracks, a tall, heav­ily built black man. His size was in­tim­i­dat­ing, and the hoodie he wore made him look sin­is­ter.</p>
    <p>As we drew nearer to each other, an in­choate fear seized me: My mind was mugged by vividly coloured snap­shot images from in­nu­mer­able TV shows and movies of men­ac­ing black men, and re­flex­ively, my hand went to my hip pocket and clutched my wal­let.</p>
    <p>We passed each other and noth­ing hap­pened – not even a glance in my di­rec­tion, and as im­me­di­ate as the re­lief that had washed away the fear was an in­ti­ma­tion of shame.</p>
    <p>I’d thought well of my­self as free of any brazen prej­u­dices and a “pro­gres­sive” who ab­horred racism, but that very brief or­di­nary en­counter had jolted this con­ceit.</p>
    <p>IM­PLICIT BIAS</p>
    <p>Sci­ence has an ex­pla­na­tion – though per­haps not an ex­cuse – for my mind’s spon­ta­neous and easy reach for stereo­types.</p>
    <p>It is a man­i­fes­ta­tion of im­plicit (or un­con­scious) bias, and re­search has shown that there are brain re­gions in­volved in this predilec­tion for such stereo­typ­ing – some­thing that has its ori­gins in early child­hood.</p>
    <p>Amid our ex­is­tence teem­ing with all its daily minu­tiae, our brain needs to sort ev­ery­thing (in­clud­ing peo­ple) into cat­e­gories, so that we can bet­ter nav­i­gate the world with­out be­ing over­whelmed by hav­ing to deal with too much in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>An in­trin­sic part of this process is to “es­sen­tialise” these cat­e­gories by re­duc­ing them to cer­tain el­e­men­tal at­tributes. While an ef­fi­cient and fast way of pro­cess­ing in­for­ma­tion, it is also nec­es­sar­ily re­duc­tive and es­sen­tially in­ac­cu­rate as well as prone to form­ing prej­u­dices and stereo­types.</p>
    <p>From an evo­lu­tion­ary per­spec­tive, this func­tion of cat­e­goris­ing has helped hu­man be­ings to sur­vive. In the his­tory of hu­mankind, Homo sapi­ens has been tribal, work­ing and co­op­er­at­ing with mem­bers of the same group to com­pete and fight for scarce re­sources against other groups.</p>
    <p>And through the mil­len­nia, that ten­dency to view out­siders with sus­pi­cion and cau­tion has em­bed­ded it­self into our psy­che, where it con­tin­ues to op­er­ate un­ceas­ingly in our sub­con­scious.</p>
    <p>De­spite our best in­ten­tions, we can’t im­mure our­selves from ab­sorb­ing and in­ter­nal­is­ing those stereo­typed images and ideas that are per­va­sive in any so­ci­ety. To bor­row an anal­ogy by psy­chol­o­gist Bev­erly Daniel Ta­tum, a former pres­i­dent of Spel­man Col­lege: These types of cul­tural bi­ases are like smog in the air that we take in un­con­sciously.</p>
    <p>Over the past decades, re­searchers have de­vel­oped tools to un­cover and study im­plicit bias.</p>
    <p>One com­monly used as­sess­ment is the Im­plicit As­so­ci­a­tion Test, de­vel­oped by a team of so­cial psy­chol­o­gists at the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton and Yale Univer­sity. In their land­mark pa­per pub­lished in 1998, they de­scribed it as “a new tool that mea­sures the un­con­scious roots of prej­u­dice”, which they said af­fected 90 to 95 per cent of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There have been sub­se­quent crit­i­cisms of this tool – for one thing, the sta­bil­ity (the tech­ni­cal jar­gon for this is “in­ter-rater re­li­a­bil­ity”) of the test is low, mean­ing that if a sub­ject takes the same test at a dif­fer­ent time, the score would dif­fer quite a bit.</p>
    <p>There are, how­ever, other tests with dif­fer­ent tools that, to date, have built up a ro­bust body of ev­i­dence sub­stan­ti­at­ing the ex­is­tence of im­plicit bias and its con­se­quen­tial ef­fects on job re­cruit­ment, ac­cess to health­care and out­comes in crim­i­nal jus­tice – in ways that dis­ad­van­tage and dis­en­fran­chise peo­ple from eth­nic mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies from the United States show that white job ap­pli­cants are far more suc­cess­ful in land­ing jobs than those from eth­nic mi­nori­ties with sim­i­lar qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Po­lice of­fi­cers are more likely to iden­tify black faces as crim­i­nal than white faces – with deadly con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>And med­i­cal lit­er­a­ture is re­plete with stud­ies that show racial and eth­nic mi­nori­ties are more likely to be mis­di­ag­nosed, be given fewer treat­ment op­tions, get less pain man­age­ment, have poorer clin­i­cal out­comes and be more likely to end up hav­ing un­nec­es­sary surgery than their white coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>THE LO­CAL CON­TEXT</p>
    <p>As a psy­chi­a­trist in mul­ti­cul­tural Sin­ga­pore, my work is al­most wholly with health­care col­leagues and pa­tients of dif­fer­ent races; and if I am mind­ful of race, it is with re­gard to how that and its at­ten­dant cul­tural char­ac­ter­is­tics would in­flu­ence the on­set, pre­sen­ta­tion and course of a pa­tient’s men­tal ill­ness.</p>
    <p>I am aware of re­search that shows how long ex­po­sure to be­ing dis­crim­i­nated against on the ba­sis of race is associated with in­creased risk of de­pres­sion, lower self-es­teem and anx­i­ety, but I have not en­coun­tered that to be con­trib­u­tory to prob­lems that my lo­cal pa­tients brought to me, or at least, none have told me so.</p>
    <p>My pol­icy hith­erto has been to try to treat ev­ery­one even-hand­edly, re­gard­less of gen­der, sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion, creed and race – very much in the same man­ner as I would want to be treated by oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther would I go out of my way to cul­ti­vate any­one of any par­tic­u­lar race. Let­ting each per­son pur­sue his or her goals and live life as he or she thinks fit seems to me the right and proper thing to do.</p>
    <p>Straits Times senior po­lit­i­cal cor­re­spon­dent Grace Ho has re­cently writ­ten in these pages on the is­sue of race in Sin­ga­pore, and she cited Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity don Eu­gene Tan.</p>
    <p>He posited that it is “gen­er­a­tional dif­fer­ences” that are be­hind the re­luc­tance to talk about dif­fi­cult things like racial dis­crim­i­na­tion and prej­u­dices: The older gen­er­a­tion, who lived through the racial ri­ots and up­heavals in the 1960s, are more leery about hav­ing such con­ver­sa­tions – a sort of col­lec­tive sup­pres­sion of trauma – than the younger gen­er­a­tion, who have thus far lived “in rel­a­tive calm and sta­bil­ity”, and per­haps have been in­cul­cated in and seen the work­ings of mer­i­toc­racy.</p>
    <p>I was too young to have any rec­ol­lec­tion of those tur­bu­lent times, though as a child, I had heard oc­ca­sional racial slurs and the ca­sual bandy­ing about of racial stereo­types.</p>
    <p>But as I grew up, they all seemed to re­cede, although they could have been seeded in my un­con­scious.</p>
    <p>I have come to re­alise that my per­spec­tive of race and its corol­lary of racial bias has very much to do with my very cir­cum­stances and my en­sconced po­si­tion within the ma­jor­ity group of eth­nic Chi­nese here; and the re­al­ity of what I see might not be the re­al­ity that peo­ple of eth­nic mi­nor­ity groups might see and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>While peo­ple in the ma­jor­ity like me may see or hear of in­ten­tional and bla­tant acts of dis­crim­i­na­tion, peo­ple in the mi­nor­ity eth­nic groups may ex­pe­ri­ence these and sub­tler ones first-hand. I have not asked any of them if they have ever en­coun­tered any in­stances of racial dis­crim­i­na­tion – and on re­flec­tion, it is prob­a­bly a de­sire of not re­ally want­ing to know, and to stay safe and com­fort­able in this bub­ble.</p>
    <p>I won­der, if I’m made to en­gage in hon­est talks on race and racism, whether I would re­act with some ver­sion of what Amer­i­can so­ci­ol­o­gist and di­ver­sity con­sul­tant Robin DiAn­gelo calls “white fragility”, which refers to the propen­sity of white peo­ple to re­spond to any charge of racism with “emo­tions such as anger, fear and guilt”. In her view, they be­have in this way to ex­ert white racial con­trol and pro­tect white ad­van­tage and priv­i­lege.</p>
    <p>It’s hard to say how much truth there is to this seem­ingly sim­plis­tic ex­pla­na­tion for the sys­temic racism that ex­ists in many Amer­i­can in­sti­tu­tions and whether it is gen­er­al­is­able to other ma­jor­ity groups in other so­ci­eties, but Dr DiAn­gelo’s strin­gent ideas have prod­ded me to con­sider how obliv­i­ous – whether wil­fully or not – I have been to my var­i­ous muted bi­ases.</p>
    <p>Im­plicit bias may be the prod­uct of one of our psy­cho­log­i­cal pro­cesses that shapes how we in­ter­act with one an­other, and we might not be able to elim­i­nate these bi­ases. But their in­escapa­bil­ity does not ex­on­er­ate us of any racist at­ti­tude and be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Be­ing aware and hav­ing in­sight present the pos­si­bil­ity of change: to re-ex­am­ine how the way we see, think, talk and do things may be tinged by our bi­ases.</p>
    <p>The more de­cent of us would be chas­tened and make a con­scious ef­fort to re­shape our think­ing and at­ti­tudes. But it will al­ways be a work in progress – one that calls for on­go­ing vig­i­lance and un­flinch­ing hon­esty.</p>
