    <p>RACE 1 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>3 Beaut Beaut is a three-time Class 4 win­ner who now finds him­self in Class 5. He has had one run al­ready this term.</p>
    <p>5 Xi­ang Lan Qi is weighted to go close with Jerry Chau’s 10lb (4.54kg) claim. He has had a re­cent trial un­der his belt.</p>
    <p>8 So­lar Vic­tory tri­alled well. Things might be start­ing to click for him now af­ter five medi­ocre starts. 4 Fan­tas­tic Fabio is honest. He should not be too far away.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>9 Blaz­ing Part­ners needs a fas­trun race and might just get that. He should get every chance to rat­tle over the top.</p>
    <p>6 Galaxy Em­peror has shown steady im­prove­ment. He was third first-up over this course and dis­tance.</p>
    <p>2 Smil­ing Suc­cess is drawn well. He is ex­pected to roll for­ward with Chau’s 10lb claim.</p>
    <p>10 Rochford is an­other who can lead. He can cling on for a cheque.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>9 The Drive has a bit of qual­ity about him. This might be the right grade for him to be­gin his climb back from Class 4 to Class 3.</p>
    <p>2 Golden Four races well fresh and has drawn to get favours. It would not shock to see him up there.</p>
    <p>3 Best For You was An­toine Hamelin’s first Hong Kong win and the pair unite again. He is honest and de­serves re­spect.</p>
    <p>8 Happy Tango has shown glimpses of abil­ity. He should be around the mark again.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>2 Nordic War­rior should be able to cap­i­talise on a re­turn to Class 4 with the right run. The book­ing of cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton is a plus.</p>
    <p>1 Eligere has taken his time to ac­cli­ma­tise. It is only a mat­ter of time be­fore he gets on the board.</p>
    <p>9 Sparkling Star has shown plenty of abil­ity. Although drawn awk­wardly, he should rel­ish get­ting up to 1,400m.</p>
    <p>5 Colonel has shown flashes of po­ten­tial to sug­gest that he could win any time.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>7 Galac­tic showed plenty of abil­ity last sea­son. He is the one to run down on his lat­est trial for his new trainer Tony Mil­lard.</p>
    <p>9 All Joy­ful ap­pears to be just be­gin­ning his as­cent up the hand­i­cap.</p>
    <p>8 Hot Chili Pep­per is worth each­way in this tight lit­tle con­test.</p>
    <p>4 Golden Link has the runs on the board. He can run well again.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>5 Dol­lar Re­ward loves the course and dis­tance. He might find him­self in the right spot from Gate 3.</p>
    <p>1 Hand­some Rebel led through­out last start. From the favourable draw, he should be in front for a long way.</p>
    <p>2 For­tune Hap­pi­ness is near­ing the mark to be com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>10 De­mons Rock is on the right track and races well on the dirt. He is drawn to get the right run.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>1 Mr Wealth won first-up in this grade last sea­son. It would not shock to see light­ning strike twice.</p>
    <p>7 Grate­ful Heart has not set the track aglow yet but did catch the eye at the tri­als.</p>
    <p>3 Cal­i­for­nia Con­cord won sec­ondup last term. He is go­ing to try and do the same again.</p>
    <p>9 Sky Show is on the up and loves the dirt. He will be right in the thick of things.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,400M) GROUP 3 CEL­E­BRA­TION CUP</p>
    <p>3 Ka Ying Star should roll for­ward in this dif­fi­cult con­test and give his all as he usu­ally does. Only a fiveyear-old, his best could still be ahead of him.</p>
    <p>1 Beauty Gen­er­a­tion re­sumes in search of his fourth con­sec­u­tive Group 3 Cel­e­bra­tion Cup. He races well fresh and boasts an im­pos­ing record. Only con­cern is his age.</p>
    <p>6 Golden Sixty com­pleted a FourYear-Old Clas­sic Se­ries clean sweep last sea­son. He gets in very well at the weights.</p>
    <p>2 Southern Leg­end is honest. Although he is bet­ter over the mile, he can still be very com­pet­i­tive in this first-up con­test.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>8 Biz Power has tri­alled well. He re­turns first-up with Joao Mor­eira on his back, which sig­nals in­tent.</p>
    <p>9 Pres­i­dent’s Choice is a small horse, but he has plenty of abil­ity as a two-time win­ner from seven starts. Only the wide draw makes it a bit dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>7 Big For­tune rarely runs a bad race. He re­turns first-up fol­low­ing an all-the-way trial vic­tory. He is worth keep­ing safe.</p>
    <p>13 Bright Kid has gone to a new level of late with two wins from his last four starts. Do not dis­count.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>2 Mr Crois­sant is a classy gal­loper. He ap­peared to move very freely in a re­cent bar­rier trial. If he is for­ward enough first-up, he could take some beat­ing.</p>
    <p>4 Wa­ter Diviner races well fresh. There is no rea­son to sug­gest he will not be ready for the re­sump­tion. He is worth each-way.</p>
    <p>6 Good Luck Friend is shoot­ing for his fourth con­sec­u­tive win. He is drawn favourably, but he needs to be at his best to beat this bunch.</p>
    <p>10 Ar­mando rat­tled home on de­but. He clearly has abil­ity. With the right run, he can fig­ure.</p>
