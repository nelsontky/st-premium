    <p>The big­gest party in the Malaysian gov­ern­ment has found it­self at a cross­roads af­ter for­mer Umno pres­i­dent Na­jib Razak was con­victed of cor­rup­tion and money laun­der­ing in a his­toric de­ci­sion by the High Court on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>De­spite calls from Umno’s for­mer youth leader Khairy Ja­malud­din for the party to “move on” from Na­jib – who is cur­rently dis­qual­i­fied from con­test­ing any elec­tion – many se­nior lead­ers have pub­licly shown their sup­port in­stead of fol­low­ing the con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said the party would have to “do some­thing” fol­low­ing the ver­dict, and hinted yes­ter­day that the party would re-eval­u­ate its “shar­ing ar­range­ment” in the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In a later state­ment, he said “se­ri­ous at­ten­tion” should be given to the judg­ment of the court.</p>
    <p>“Umno/BN (Barisan Na­sional) will over­come this judg­ment in the best way while de­fend­ing our re­la­tion­ships within BN, Muafakat Na­sional and Perikatan Na­sional.”</p>
    <p>His state­ments came a day af­ter Mr Khairy, a Cab­i­net min­is­ter in Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s gov­ern­ment, urged the party to move on and re­build. Mr Khairy had failed in his bid to chal­lenge Ah­mad Zahid for Umno’s pres­i­dency fol­low­ing the party’s his­toric loss in the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The son-in-law of for­mer pre­mier Ab­dul­lah Badawi, he is of­ten seen as the face of mod­er­a­tion within the Malay na­tion­al­ist party.</p>
    <p>Umno is the big­gest com­po­nent in the five-month-old Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment led by Tan Sri Muhyid­din, with 38 MPs.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Mr Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, the se­cond-big­gest party in the PN ad­min­is­tra­tion, has 32 MPs.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said Umno is cur­rently di­vided, with dif­fer­ent camps push­ing the party in dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions, but as­serted that Na­jib still holds sway within the party de­spite his graft con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>Univer­siti Utara Malaysia an­a­lyst Mohd Az­izud­din Mohd Sani told The Straits Times: “The re­al­ity is Umno is di­vided. Some want to leave Perikatan (Na­sional).</p>
    <p>“Some want to move on, and not drag this (Na­jib) case (with them).”</p>
    <p>The cur­rent No. 2 in Umno, Mr Mo­hamad Has­san, who flanked Na­jib in court on Tues­day, had pre­vi­ously called for a snap elec­tion to be held in or­der to re­turn the man­date to the peo­ple, un­der­lin­ing the party’s frag­ile re­la­tion­ship with Mr Muhyid­din’s Ber­satu party in PN.</p>
    <p>How­ever, one part­ner that both Umno and Na­jib seem to have firmly on their side is Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS), with whom they have an­other part­ner­ship, Muafakat Na­sional.</p>
    <p>Umno lead­ers such as Mr Puad Zarkashi have as­serted that Umno is bet­ter off on a Muafakat Na­sional plat­form than with PN.</p>
    <p>PAS lead­ers, in­clud­ing pres­i­dent Hadi Awang, vis­ited Na­jib at his home im­me­di­ately af­ter the court pro­ceed­ings on Tues­day, with Na­jib de­scrib­ing them as “true friends”.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Hadi ex­pressed con­fi­dence that Na­jib would be able to clear his name in the higher courts.</p>
    <p>Dr Oh Ei Sun, a se­nior fel­low at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs, said: “Umno, along with PAS, ac­tu­ally won 75 per cent of Malay votes in the last elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The mis­take was PAS split Umno’s votes. But now that they are to­gether, you are see­ing them win a string of by-elec­tions.”</p>
    <p>Dr Oh said Na­jib is still a “plus” for Umno even though he is cur­rently un­able to con­test an elec­tion, but some fac­tions within the party would not mind if it were to set the for­mer pre­mier aside.</p>
    <p>Dr Az­izud­din said Na­jib could still field his son Mohd Nizar Na­jib, also an Umno mem­ber, to re­place him in his home con­stituency of Pekan should he be un­able to con­test elec­tions – and as a re­sult maintain his influence.</p>
    <p>“As a for­mer prime min­is­ter, he can influence Umno’s de­ci­sion. He can pull off some­thing to show he can still dic­tate things in the party.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, this is sub­ject to Umno al­low­ing it to hap­pen.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">A flooded sports ground along the Yangtze River in Wuhan in China&#x2019;s cen&#xAD;tral Hubei prov&#xAD;ince. Floods in the coun&#xAD;try caused by con&#xAD;tin&#xAD;u&#xAD;ous heavy rain since last month have af&#xAD;fected some 54.8 mil&#xAD;lion peo&#xAD;ple in 27 pro&#xAD;vin&#xAD;cial re&#xAD;gions as of Tues&#xAD;day, said the Min&#xAD;istry of Emer&#xAD;gency Man&#xAD;age&#xAD;ment. Floods in these ar&#xAD;eas, in&#xAD;clud&#xAD;ing the prov&#xAD;inces of Jiangxi, An&#xAD;hui and Hubei, have lef t 158 peo&#xAD;ple dead or miss&#xAD;ing and forced the re&#xAD;lo&#xAD;ca&#xAD;tion of around 3.76 mil&#xAD;lion peo&#xAD;ple. About 368,000 houses have been dam&#xAD;aged and di&#xAD;rect eco&#xAD;nomic losses amounted to 144.4 bil&#xAD;lion yuan (S$28.4 bil&#xAD;lion). The min&#xAD;istry said it will con&#xAD;tinue to dis&#xAD;patch res&#xAD;cue forces and al&#xAD;lo&#xAD;cate sup&#xAD;plies to flood-hit re&#xAD;gions. Re&#xAD;lief items such as two mil&#xAD;lion wo&#xAD;ven bags and 1.52 mil&#xAD;lion sq m of wo&#xAD;ven fab&#xAD;ric had been al&#xAD;lo&#xAD;cated from na&#xAD;tional re&#xAD;serves to Hu&#xAD;nan, while an&#xAD;other 65,000 items, in&#xAD;clud&#xAD;ing blan&#xAD;kets and fold&#xAD;ing beds, had been sent to An&#xAD;hui and Jiangxi. The pa&#xAD;trolling of dikes and sluices around the Yangtze River, Huai River and Taihu Lake will be strength&#xAD;ened to en&#xAD;sure safety dur&#xAD;ing flood preven&#xAD;tion work, said the Of&#xAD;fice of State Flood Con&#xAD;trol and Drought Re&#xAD;lief Head&#xAD;quar&#xAD;ters.</p>
