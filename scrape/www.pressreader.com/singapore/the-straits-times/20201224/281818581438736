    <p>OT­TAWA • Canada and Bri­tain have signed a tem­po­rary agree­ment to avoid an in­crease in tar­iffs between the two coun­tries af­ter Bri­tain’s exit from the Euro­pean Union sin­gle mar­ket early next year, Ot­tawa has said.</p>
    <p>At the end of last month, both coun­tries an­nounced they had con­cluded a pro­vi­sional post-Brexit trade agree­ment that would re­flect, as of Jan 1, the terms of the deal that Bri­tain ben­e­fited from as a mem­ber state of the EU.</p>
    <p>But the agree­ment could not be rat­i­fied be­fore the Cana­dian Par­lia­ment went into its win­ter re­cess, which would have re­sulted in an au­to­matic in­crease in tar­iffs between the two coun­tries on Jan 1.</p>
    <p>The tem­po­rary deal al­lows tar­iffs between the two coun­tries to re­main at cur­rent lev­els un­til the new trade deal is passed in Par­lia­ment, a For­eign Min­istry state­ment said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>With the in­terim agree­ment, the Cana­dian gov­ern­ment “is mak­ing sure busi­nesses can eas­ily con­tinue trad­ing with­out adding pa­per­work for busi­nesses and im­porters”, it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“These mea­sures will en­sure sta­bil­ity and cer­tainty on both sides of the At­lantic,” the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral trade with Bri­tain was worth C$29 bil­lion (S$30 bil­lion) last year, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial gov­ern­ment fig­ures. Bri­tain is the main mar­ket for Cana­dian ex­ports to Europe.</p>
