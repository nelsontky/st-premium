    <p>The Hol­land Vil­lage eatery that was or­dered to close tem­po­rar­ily last month for fail­ing to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing among pa­trons has im­ple­mented more safety mea­sures since re­open­ing late last month.</p>
    <p>Mr Khader Basha Ghouse Basha, gen­eral man­ager of Bri­tish In­dian Curry Hut in Lorong Mam­bong, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the restau­rant has in­stalled a ther­mal scan­ner.</p>
    <p>It has also in­stalled a queue man­age­ment sys­tem so that cus­tomers will not loi­ter along the road.</p>
    <p>Mr Basha said: “We are also tak­ing more reser­va­tions and (have) fewer walk-ins.”</p>
    <p>He added that the restau­rant is also grow­ing its food de­liv­ery busi­ness. It has also gone be­yond the ba­sic mea­sures re­quired by the Gov­ern­ment, such as hav­ing a smaller num­ber of dine-in cus­tomers, he said.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers must use the SafeEn­try check-in sys­tem via a QR code on the ther­mal scan­ner’s screen be­fore they en­ter the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>The spruced-up mea­sures come af­ter the Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) or­dered the restau­rant to be closed for over a week, just af­ter it had re­opened for dine-in pa­trons on June 19, when phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing started.</p>
    <p>A photo cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia then showed groups of peo­ple packed closely to­gether in the restau­rant’s out­door sit­ting area, as well as crowds stand­ing on the road out­side the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>A URA spokesman said yes­ter­day: “We are mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion closely and will re­view with other agen­cies whether the out­door re­fresh­ment ar­eas along Lorong Mam­bong can re­open and the daily road clo­sures re­sume.”</p>
    <p>URA had pre­vi­ously opened Lorong Mam­bong to traf­fic to stop peo­ple from gath­er­ing on the street.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lars told ST last Satur­day evening that the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have im­proved their din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence at Hol­land Vil­lage since the start of phase two.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate tu­tor Tan Kay Siang, 34, said: “The street used to be so much louder and the restau­rants were full of chat­ter be­fore Covid-19. Now, it is not as busy as be­fore and I don’t have to raise my voice to talk to my friends.”</p>
