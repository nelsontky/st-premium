    <p>On Aug 9, the flag will be raised in con­cur­rent cer­e­monies at the Padang and seven other lo­ca­tions around the is­land. Sin­ga­pore­ans will be ral­lied to take part from their homes, while each lo­ca­tion will have its own Na­tional Day event at­tended by min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>On the morn­ing of Aug 9, full-time na­tional ser­vice­man Lim Yu Jie, 20, will be en­trusted with a sa­cred duty: He will raise the state flag at the Padang at 10.30am.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the flag will also be raised in cer­e­monies at sev­eral lo­ca­tions across the coun­try as Sin­ga­pore­ans unite in singing the Na­tional An­them as one.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee yes­ter­day re­leased de­tails of one of the cor­ner­stones of this year’s event, which it calls the “an­them mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>The Public Warn­ing Sys­tem will be sounded to rally Sin­ga­pore­ans to take part in the mo­ment from home.</p>
    <p>Broad­en­ing NDP be­yond its tra­di­tional as­so­ci­a­tion with de­fence, the mo­ment at 10.30am will see con­cur­rent flag cer­e­monies, in ad­di­tion to the one at the Padang, at seven other spots se­lected to stand for Sin­ga­pore’s key sec­tors dur­ing the dis­rup­tion caused by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The lo­ca­tions are: the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID) rep­re­sent­ing health­care; North Vista Sec­ondary School rep­re­sent­ing ed­u­ca­tion; Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty for hous­ing and com­mu­nity; Changi Air­port for trans­port; the Life­long Learn­ing In­sti­tute for em­ploy­ment and skills; the En­abling Vil­lage in Bukit Merah for so­cial services; and FairPrice Hub in Joo Koon for trade and in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Each lo­ca­tion will hold its own Na­tional Day event at­tended by the sec­tor’s re­spec­tive min­is­ters, un­like in pre­vi­ous years when top gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials were gath­ered at the main pa­rade.</p>
    <p>This year, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen, and Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam will be seated on the steps of the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore over­look­ing the pa­rade.</p>
    <p>New Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung will be at Changi Air­port, Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Desmond Lee at Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty, and Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong at North Vista Sec­ondary, while Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo will be at the Life­long Learn­ing In­sti­tute, So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli at the En­abling Vil­lage, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim</p>
    <p>Yong at NCID, and Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing at FairPrice Hub in Joo Koon.</p>
    <p>Around 40 rep­re­sen­ta­tives of each sec­tor, such as teach­ers for ed­u­ca­tion, will also be in­vited to each lo­ca­tion in a show of ap­pre­ci­a­tion for their ef­forts in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Colonel Cai Dex­ian, chair­man of the home cel­e­bra­tions and en­gage­ment com­mit­tee, said the Na­tional An­them was cho­sen as one of the key mo­ments of this year’s trans­formed cel­e­bra­tions as it is a “mu­si­cal ex­pres­sion of Sin­ga­pore’s col­lec­tive am­bi­tion and hope”.</p>
    <p>He in­vited Sin­ga­pore­ans to tune in to the live broad­cast from their homes and record them­selves par­tic­i­pat­ing in the an­them mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“Lo­ca­tions are re­ally just places with­out peo­ple bring­ing them to life,” said Col Cai, 36, adding that videos of peo­ple singing the an­them can be sent to go.gov.sg/an­them­mo­ment2020 for a chance to be fea­tured in the NDP evening broad­cast.</p>
    <p>The NDP or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee is also work­ing with public agen­cies and ma­jor com­pa­nies to or­gan­ise other cer­e­monies at lo­ca­tions such as mil­i­tary camps, trans­port de­pots and Sin­ga­pore mis­sions over­seas.</p>
    <p>Broad­en­ing NDP be­yond its tra­di­tional as­so­ci­a­tion with de­fence, the mo­ment at 10.30am will see con­cur­rent flag cer­e­monies, in ad­di­tion to the one at the Padang, at seven other spots se­lected to stand for Sin­ga­pore’s key sec­tors dur­ing the dis­rup­tion caused by Covid-19.</p>
