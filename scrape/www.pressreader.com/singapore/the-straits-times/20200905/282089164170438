    <p>Miss Parti Liyani kept her tri­als and tribu­la­tions from her fam­ily for the past four years, not want­ing them to be wor­ried.</p>
    <p>She only apol­o­gised for not re­mit­ting money home.</p>
    <p>The for­mer maid was ac­cused of steal­ing from Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily. Yes­ter­day, the 46-year-old In­done­sian woman from East Java was ac­quit­ted in the High Court of steal­ing over $34,000 worth of items.</p>
    <p>Later in the evening, she said she felt no ill will to­wards the Liew fam­ily. Speak­ing via Zoom, through a trans­la­tor, she said: “I for­give my em­ployer. I just wish to tell them not to do the same thing to other work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Miss Parti and her lawyer, Mr Anil Balchan­dani, who is act­ing pro bono, plan to re­quest com­pen­sa­tion from the Liew fam­ily that will be tied largely to four years of her pay, which was $600 a month.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer said: “What­ever the amount we get, I think we will be nec­es­sar­ily grate­ful for.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore her dis­missal, the court heard that the nine years with the Liew fam­ily were largely cor­dial; they gave her red pack­ets on spe­cial oc­ca­sions. Things soured when she was asked to clean the of­fice of Mr Liew’s son, Karl, and his house in the Chancery Lane es­tate, where the Liew fam­ily home was also lo­cated.</p>
    <p>When Mr Karl Liew told her that her em­ploy­ment was ter­mi­nated, she told him: “I know why. You are an­gry be­cause I re­fused to clean up your toi­let.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has con­tacted the Min­istry of Man­power re­gard­ing her com­plaint about her de­ploy­ment to Mr Karl Liew’s home.</p>
    <p>Miss Parti said that through­out her trial, she did not want to worry her fam­ily, es­pe­cially her el­derly mother. But she plans to tell them of her or­deal in a few days. For now, she is un­able to leave Sin­ga­pore as she faces a pend­ing charge for fraud­u­lent pos­ses­sion of prop­erty.</p>
    <p>But when she is able to leave, it may be a one-way trip as she hopes to re­turn to her home­town to open a small busi­ness sell­ing food.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to her re­solve through­out the cur­rent pro­ceed­ings over the theft charges, she said: “I never thought of plead­ing guilty be­cause I am in fact in­no­cent.”</p>
    <p>IN­NO­CENT</p>
    <p>I never thought of plead­ing guilty be­cause I am in fact in­no­cent.’’</p>
    <p>MISS PARTI LIYANI, re­fer­ring to the cur­rent pro­ceed­ings over the theft charges.</p>
