    <p>WHO Ay­den Sng, 27, is Me­di­a­corp’s ris­ing new star. The ef­fec­tively bilin­gual ac­tor, who ma­jored in in­ter­na­tional com­par­a­tive stud­ies at Duke Univer­sity in North Carolina, worked as a prod­uct con­sul­tant in a dig­i­tal con­sul­tancy firm be­fore he turned to act­ing full time. He got his first lead­ing role in Lov­ing You, a ro­mance drama which aired ear­lier this year. Sng, who is also a model, can now be seen in the 130-episode culi­nary drama Recipe Of Life, which airs on Chan­nel 8 on week­days at 7.30pm. The series, which is ex­pected to con­tinue film­ing up till March, is also avail­able on meWatch.</p>
    <p>When I’m in pro­duc­tion for a drama, I have no con­cept of week­ends or week­days. I have only days off and days when I have to be on set. On days when I don’t film I do other work – I work with brands to cre­ate fash­ion con­tent for my In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>I work on my mu­sic as well. I’m record­ing the theme song for Recipe Of Life, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>When all of that is done and I’m re­ally free, I’m a very homely per­son. I’m quite geeky and don’t re­ally like go­ing out. I spend a lot of time watch­ing tele­vi­sion. I ob­serve the act­ing and learn how pro­duc­tions are done, con­ve­nient ex­cuses for me to just watch dra­mas the whole day.</p>
    <p>Right now I’m watch­ing a</p>
    <p>Chi­nese fam­ily drama called Go Ahead, which is on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>I’m also re­ally into Chi­nese anime pro­duced by Chi­nese video sites like Bili­bili and Ten­cent. I’m watch­ing one called A Record Of A Mor­tal’s Jour­ney To Im­mor­tal­ity, which has been up­loaded onto YouTube by Bili­bili. They use 3D animation and the char­ac­ters look ex­tremely life­like. It’s very cool.</p>
    <p>I watch Ja­panese anime as well. I’ve been a huge fan since I was young and no mat­ter how busy I get, I al­ways find time to watch anime be­cause it truly re­laxes me. Even on days when I’m film­ing, I’ll come home, triple-cleanse my face of make-up and then it’s anime time.</p>
    <p>I’m re­ally like an otaku (a Ja­panese word to describe some­one with very con­sum­ing in­ter­ests, par­tic­u­larly in anime, manga and games).</p>
    <p>If I’m free on week­ends, I might go to a friend’s place and we’ll put on our vir­tual re­al­ity head­sets and play this Star Wars game on the PlaySta­tion 4.</p>
    <p>I’m also play­ing this on­line game that be­came su­per pop­u­lar re­cently called Gen­shin Im­pact, by a Chi­nese video game com­pany. It’s cross-plat­form – you can play on the desk­top or on your phone and you can play with other peo­ple too.</p>
