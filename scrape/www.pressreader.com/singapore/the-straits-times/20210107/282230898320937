    <p>Coro­n­avirus will not kill the of­fice. If any­thing, it fig­ures to be more dy­namic than ever. The abil­ity to work re­motely will not drive most peo­ple away from ci­ties and of­fices, but it will en­able many to live and work in new ways and places – while caus­ing its fair share of dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the pan­demic, there were signs of trou­ble with the of­fice mar­ket in the hand­ful of ci­ties where the “cre­ative class” had been flock­ing. In 2018, net mi­gra­tion to New York, Los An­ge­les and San Francisco was neg­a­tive, while the United States econ­omy grew at a healthy 2.9 per cent. Cre­ative mag­nets like Lon­don and Paris were ex­pe­ri­enc­ing sim­i­lar de­clines.</p>
    <p>The ex­pla­na­tion for the de­clines – mostly high hous­ing costs be­cause of se­vere lim­its on new con­struc­tion – ob­scures other forces that were desta­bil­is­ing the tra­di­tional of­fice mar­ket. In the mid­dle of the 2010s, Ama­zon, Face­book, Google, Ap­ple and oth­ers started split­ting their head­quar­ters into mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions. Stripe, one of the world’s most valu­able start-ups, went a step fur­ther. In 2019, it “opened” a re­mote hub, hop­ing to “tap the 99.74 per cent of tal­ented en­gi­neers liv­ing out­side the metro ar­eas of our first four hubs” in San Francisco, Seat­tle, Dublin and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For the fastest-grow­ing com­pa­nies, be­ing able to tap tal­ent any­where be­came more im­por­tant than hav­ing all their teams in one place. Smaller ci­ties were good enough. In ret­ro­spect, this shouldn’t have been a sur­prise, de­spite all the talk about the im­por­tance of giant, dense labour mar­kets to fuel in­no­va­tion. Af­ter all, Sil­i­con Val­ley it­self is not a city but a clus­ter of sprawl­ing towns scat­tered along a high­way.</p>
    <p>The defin­ing char­ac­ter­is­tic of this new ver­sion of the cre­ative class may not be where it lives but its abil­ity to live any­where it wants. Put dif­fer­ently, peo­ple move to cer­tain ci­ties in search of bet­ter-pay­ing jobs, but it’s now pos­si­ble to earn high (if not the high­est) salaries from al­most any­where. That has been true in cer­tain smaller ci­ties in re­cent years (Austin, Texas and Denver in the US, for ex­am­ple, and Manch­ester and Leeds in Bri­tain). To a lesser ex­tent, it has also been true for peo­ple who chose not to live in ci­ties at all.</p>
    <p>There were more spe­cific signs that the of­fice mar­ket was headed for a cri­sis. While em­ploy­ers were fight­ing over tal­ent, many em­ploy­ees found tra­di­tional of­fices lack­ing. In 2019, Leesman, a firm that mea­sures em­ployee ex­pe­ri­ences, an­a­lysed how the work­place af­fects em­ployee pro­duc­tiv­ity, pride and en­joy­ment. Draw­ing on 719,000 re­spon­dents in 4,771 work­places world­wide, Leesman found that nearly 40 per cent of em­ploy­ees felt their work­place did not en­able them to work pro­duc­tively.</p>
    <p>Then the pan­demic forced many em­ploy­ees to re­assess their pref­er­ences. Mul­ti­ple sur­veys have found that many are happy to con­tinue to work re­motely and would move, if given the chance.</p>
    <p>Still, this data tells us lit­tle about the post-Covid-19 world. Those who thrived ini­tially might burn out if they stayed home for a more ex­tended pe­riod. Those who strug­gled might do much bet­ter once they’ve mas­tered new tools, once they have ac­cess to al­ter­na­tive spa­ces near home, or once chil­dren, house­mates and part­ners are back in school or at work. At the same time, the tech­nolo­gies that al­low us to work, learn and so­cialise re­motely will only get bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Covid-19-era mar­ket data also of­fers mixed sig­nals. Land­lords and bro­kers are quick to point out that com­pa­nies like Google and Face­book signed new leases dur­ing the pan­demic. But these com­pa­nies hire thou­sands of new em­ploy­ees ev­ery quar­ter and plan their ex­pan­sion many quar­ters or years in ad­vance. Even com­pa­nies that aren’t in growth mode have yet to make up their mind about the new nor­mal. In­stead, many are re­new­ing their ex­ist­ing leases for a shorter pe­riod un­til mar­ket con­di­tions be­come clearer. Data from JLL, a real es­tate con­sul­tancy, shows that re­newals as a share of leas­ing ac­tiv­ity have jumped to 51 per cent from 29 per cent pre-Covid-19, and that leases are be­com­ing shorter.</p>
    <p>It seems safe to say that to­tal de­mand for of­fices will di­min­ish to a mod­er­ate de­gree. The big­ger changes will be in how to­tal de­mand is reshuf­fled and what of­fice providers will have to do to re­main com­pet­i­tive. Most of­fice ac­tiv­ity will not move to homes or to the cloud. In­stead, it is likely to be re­dis­tributed within and be­tween ci­ties, with a va­ri­ety of new em­ploy­ment ar­eas pop­ping up and sav­ing many peo­ple the trou­ble of si­mul­ta­ne­ous com­mut­ing to a Cen­tral Busi­ness District.</p>
    <p>Post-Covid-19, for ex­am­ple, a Brook­lyn or Queens res­i­dent who pre­vi­ously com­muted to Man­hat­tan may opt to work sev­eral days a week in a shared space within a 10-minute walk from home. Some large em­ploy­ers are al­ready ex­per­i­ment­ing with satel­lite of­fices in the sub­urbs of ci­ties in which they al­ready have the down­town head­quar­ters. The main of­fice will re­main im­por­tant for most com­pa­nies, but fewer em­ploy­ees will be ex­pected to be there all day, ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>The of­fice will be­come more of a con­sumer prod­uct. And just like ev­ery con­sumer prod­uct, the of­fice will have to con­tin­u­ally fight for its cus­tomers and meet their needs – not only when it’s time to re­new the lease.</p>
    <p>Of­fices will need spa­ces for spe­cific tasks like fo­cused work, team brain­storm­ing, client pre­sen­ta­tions and em­ployee train­ing. And they will need to be more fo­cused on in­di­vid­u­als, even if these peo­ple work for a large com­pany.</p>
    <p>These changes will be grad­ual, but they will have a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on ur­ban of­fice build­ings, which used to be per­ceived as al­most as safe as gov­ern­ment bonds. Con­sider, in com­par­i­son, that the “re­tail apoca­lypse” that led to mul­ti­ple bank­rupt­cies and the clos­ing of tens of thou­sands of stores was a re­sult of less than 12 per cent of all ac­tiv­ity mov­ing on­line, over a pe­riod of two decades, while to­tal sales were still grow­ing.</p>
    <p>Over the next decade, the trans­for­ma­tion of the of­fice mar­ket fig­ures to be less com­pre­hen­sive, but it will prob­a­bly hap­pen faster and to an in­dus­try that is far less pre­pared. And just as in re­tail, it will cre­ate some new win­ners, as well as a mul­ti­tude of losers – those un­will­ing or un­able to ad­just to an era of worker choice.</p>
    <p>It seems safe to say that to­tal de­mand for of­fices will di­min­ish to a mod­er­ate de­gree. The big­ger changes will be in how to­tal de­mand is reshuf­fled and what of­fice providers will have to do to re­main com­pet­i­tive.</p>
