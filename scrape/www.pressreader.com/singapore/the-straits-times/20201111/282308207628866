    <p>BEI­JING • China yes­ter­day laid out de­tailed reg­u­la­tions for the first time to root out mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices in the In­ter­net sec­tor, as Bei­jing seeks to cur­tail the grow­ing dom­i­nance of cor­po­ra­tions like Alibaba Group Hold­ing and Ten­cent Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s an­titrust watch­dog is seek­ing feed­back on a raft of reg­u­la­tions that es­tab­lish a frame­work for cur­tail­ing anti-com­pet­i­tive be­hav­iour such as col­lud­ing on shar­ing sen­si­tive con­sumer data, al­liances that squeeze out smaller ri­vals and sub­si­dis­ing ser­vices at be­low cost to elim­i­nate com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>They may also re­quire firms that op­er­ate a so-called Vari­able In­ter­est En­tity – a ve­hi­cle through which vir­tu­ally ev­ery ma­jor Chi­nese In­ter­net com­pany at­tracts for­eign in­vest­ment and lists overseas – to ap­ply for spe­cific op­er­at­ing ap­proval. And they also re­strict the tar­get­ing of spe­cific cus­tomers through their on­line be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>The lat­est pro­posal fol­lows height­ened scru­tiny of tech­nol­ogy firms world­wide, as reg­u­la­tors in­ves­ti­gate the ex­tent to which In­ter­net giants from Face­book to Al­pha­bet’s Google can use valu­able data to shore up their dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers in China, home to some of the world’s largest cor­po­ra­tions, have in re­cent years protested against the grad­ual ero­sion of their pri­vacy via tech­nol­ogy from fa­cial recog­ni­tion to big data anal­y­sis. Alibaba and Ten­cent were both down more than 3 per cent in Hong Kong, in line with a broader tech sell-off.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how the reg­u­la­tions put forth by the State Ad­min­is­tra­tion of Mar­ket Reg­u­la­tion will be en­forced. Bei­jing is in­creas­ingly seek­ing to di­min­ish the in­flu­ence that a hand­ful of its tech cor­po­ra­tions wield over vast swathes of the econ­omy. It in­ves­ti­gated Ten­cent’s mu­sic arm’s ex­clu­sive agree­ments with pub­lish­ers last year, and most re­cently mod­i­fied reg­u­la­tions to rein in risk at fast-grow­ing mi­crolend­ing en­ti­ties such as Ant</p>
    <p>Group. The lat­ter move de­railed Ant’s planned US$37 bil­lion (S$50 bil­lion) ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing last week – what would have been the world’s largest such of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>The twin Chi­nese giants now dom­i­nate e-com­merce and gam­ing, and are key back­ers of lead­ers in ad­ja­cent busi­nesses such as food de­liv­ery gi­ant Meituan and carhail­ing leader Didi Chux­ing. They have to­gether in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars in hun­dreds of up-and-com­ing mo­bile and In­ter­net firms.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies like Tik­Tok owner ByteDance and Ten­cent ri­val NetEase that have risen to promi­nence with­out back­ing from ei­ther of the pair are viewed as rare ex­cep­tions. In other ar­eas, Baidu dom­i­nates on­line search.</p>
    <p>The new rules were pro­posed in ac­cor­dance with China’s Anti-Mo­nop­oly Law, which in­cluded broad lan­guage govern­ing In­ter­net firms in Jan­uary for the first time. The watch­dog is seek­ing pub­lic feed­back till Nov 30.</p>
