    <p>• Jose Mour­inho will not coun­te­nance Tot­ten­ham ever “be­ing con­sid­ered ti­tle con­tenders” de­spite be­ing two points off lead­ers Ever­ton af­ter Mon­day’s 1-0 Pre­mier League win at Burnley.</p>
    <p>Spurs fans could be for­given for think­ing oth­er­wise af­ter the nar­row win at Turf Moor not only pro­pelled them up to fifth in the ta­ble, but also means they are now the top scor­ers in the English top flight with 16 goals from six games.</p>
    <p>Al­though con­sid­ered to be part of the “Big Six”, Mour­inho’s side have not won a tro­phy since the 2008</p>
    <p>League Cup, and their last topflight league ti­tle came in 1961.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho’s sacked pre­de­ces­sor, Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino, gave the fans hope with his de­vel­op­ment of young play­ers, tak­ing them to the 2019 Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal as well as fin­ish­ing in the top three on three oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Ar­gen­tinian’s fail­ure to de­liver sil­ver­ware per­haps lends it­self to ex­pe­ri­enced cam­paigner Mour­inho’s cau­tion.</p>
    <p>“I will never con­sider our­selves ti­tle con­tenders,” the Por­tuguese coach said.</p>
    <p>Harry Kane agreed that it was too early to talk about a ti­tle chal­lenge in a sea­son that has of­fered up sev­eral sur­pris­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Eng­land cap­tain is op­ti­mistic about the fu­ture with the present squad.</p>
    <p>“We know with the team we have got and the play­ers we have got we can do some­thing spe­cial,” he told the BBC. “It’s still early on.</p>
    <p>“We need to take each game as it comes. I know it’s a cliche but we still have a lot to learn and build on. I think nights like this will give us a lot of con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are the games you need three points if you are go­ing to be up there at the end of the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Key to Spurs’ vi­brancy has been Kane’s un­der­stand­ing with South Korea for­ward Son He­ung-min, the English­man set­ting his team­mate up for their win­ner.</p>
    <p>Kane has al­ready bro­ken his per­sonal record for as­sists in a Pre­mier League sea­son with eight to set up Son’s eighth goal of the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The pair have now com­bined for 29 league goals – only Di­dier Drogba and Frank Lam­pard man­aged more, with 36 for Chelsea – and Mour­inho lauded Kane’s self­less­ness af­ter he cleared off the line as the hosts threat­ened to equalise.</p>
    <p>“In the last minute, he was press­ing and slid­ing tack­les, try­ing to stop at­tacks,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When you want to win, you do ev­ery­thing for the team. There is no space for in­di­vid­u­als or prima don­nas. Harry has this spirit and he is fan­tas­tic.</p>
    <p>“The way the team plays, he is very com­fort­able be­cause he is good in the box and also mag­nif­i­cent out­side the box.”</p>
