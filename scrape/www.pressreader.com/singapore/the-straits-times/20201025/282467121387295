    <p>Three days af­ter her novel This Mourn­able Body was longlisted for the Booker Prize, Tsitsi Dan­garem­bga was ar­rested.</p>
    <p>The Zim­bab­wean writer and film­maker was walk­ing down a main street in Harare with a friend, hold­ing plac­ards for an anti-cor­rup­tion protest. They were stand­ing at an in­ter­sec­tion when a riot po­lice ve­hi­cle ar­rived and they were told to get in.</p>
    <p>“I am much less com­fort­able in my coun­try than I was be­fore the ar­rest,” says Dan­garem­bga, 61, who has had sev­eral court ap­pear­ances but no trial date yet, a process she finds frus­trat­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was a beau­ti­ful thing for me,” she adds of the nod from the Booker. “I’d been writ­ing for 31/ decades and</p>
    <p>2 didn’t re­ally seem to be get­ting where I wanted to go.”</p>
    <p>It also gar­nered her ar­rest the in­ter­na­tional spot­light.</p>
    <p>“That was a very pos­i­tive thing for draw­ing at­ten­tion to the sit­u­a­tion in Zim­babwe, which is ex­tremely re­pres­sive in a very un­ob­tru­sive man­ner.”</p>
    <p>This Mourn­able Body is the last in a tril­ogy about Tam­budzai, whom read­ers first met as an am­bi­tious young girl in 1960s post-colo­nial Rhode­sia in Ner­vous Con­di­tions (1988), and then as a con­vent stu­dent in The Book Of Not (2006).</p>
    <p>Dan­garem­bga made his­tory with Ner­vous Con­di­tions, the first English novel pub­lished by a black Zim­bab­wean woman. In 2018, the BBC named it one of the 100 books that have shaped the world.</p>
    <p>It al­most did not hap­pen. The pub­lish­ing scene i n the 1980s was highly pa­tri­ar­chal, she re­calls, and af­ter many re­jec­tions, she mailed her man­u­script to the Women’s Press in Bri­tain, which had pub­lished black women writ­ers such as Al­ice Walker and Ama Ata Ai­doo.</p>
    <p>She did not hear back and gave up on it un­til she vis­ited Bri­tain years later and dropped in at the pub­lisher to ask if they had ever re­ceived her man­u­script. They dug it out of the cel­lar and con­tacted her the next day with a book deal.</p>
    <p>This Mourn­able Body also had a tor­tur­ous path to pub­li­ca­tion, de­spite its pre­de­ces­sors’ ac­claim.</p>
    <p>“The lit­er­ary scene in Zim­babwe has re­ally de­te­ri­o­rated, along with most things in the coun­try,” says Dan­garem­bga. “It is very dif­fi­cult to be pub­lished here.”</p>
    <p>In des­per­a­tion, she started putting ex­cerpts of the novel on Face­book, which even­tu­ally led to it be­ing picked up by pub­lish­ers abroad.</p>
    <p>In This Mourn­able Body, Tam­budzai is ap­proach­ing mid­dle age, sin­gle and un­em­ployed. “She has come to the painful re­al­i­sa­tion that ed­u­ca­tion by it­self does not guar­an­tee an in­di­vid­ual a bet­ter fu­ture,” says Dan­garem­bga.</p>
    <p>“Ed­u­ca­tion can­not func­tion in a dys­func­tional na­tion.”</p>
    <p>She had been dis­ap­pointed by Tam­budzai’s char­ac­ter in The Book Of Not, she adds.</p>
    <p>“She could not stand up to the sys­tems of op­pres­sion that she saw as a stu­dent of a multi-racial school be­cause she wanted to fit in and get ahead. It was im­por­tant for me to redeem her.”</p>
    <p>She is adamant that there will be no fourth book. “I have found the story of Tam­budzai to be very con­sum­ing in so many ways.”</p>
    <p>In­stead, she is now work­ing on a young-adult dystopian novel set in post-apoc­a­lyp­tic Africa, which she started writ­ing for her three chil­dren when they were teenagers. Two are now in their 20s and still pa­tiently wait­ing for it.</p>
    <p>If she wins the Booker, she says, it will be a “vin­di­ca­tion” for the decades she has spent writ­ing and de­vel­op­ing cre­ative en­ter­prises in Zim­babwe.</p>
    <p>“It has been a bit of a strug­gle. So it would be a proud mo­ment for me, for my work and for all those peo­ple who have ral­lied around me and who be­lieve in the same things that I be­lieve in.”</p>
