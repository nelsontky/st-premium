    <p>YINCHUAN (China) • It is cool in the early au­tumn evening in Yinchuan, but the at­mos­phere in the fit­ness room is hot.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma Qiang buck­les his belt, takes a deep breath, then starts the 100kg dead­lift train­ing for the day.</p>
    <p>As Yinchuan, cap­i­tal of north­west China’s Ningxia Hui Au­ton­o­mous Re­gion has re­cov­ered from the epi­demic, Mr Ma’s life ap­pears to be back on track.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old, whose real name is Me­barkia Seif Ed­dine, is from Al­ge­ria.</p>
    <p>“Ma Qiang” is the Chi­nese name he calls him­self.</p>
    <p>“Ma” is a com­mon sur­name in Ningxia, while the name “Qiang” means “strong” in Chi­nese be­cause he loves sports and has a strong body.</p>
    <p>In 2015, with a strong in­ter­est in Chi­nese, Mr Ma came to China to study at Ningxia Univer­sity. He stayed and worked in Yinchuan af­ter grad­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­fi­cient in English, French,</p>
    <p>Chi­nese and Ara­bic, he now teaches English in a train­ing in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>With broad shoul­ders and big mus­cles, he is of­ten mis­taken for a pro­fes­sional fit­ness in­struc­tor. Be­fore com­ing to China, he en­joyed box­ing.</p>
    <p>When he first ar­rived in the coun­try, he lost a lot of weight be­cause he was not ac­cus­tomed to the lo­cal food.</p>
    <p>In or­der to gain weight, he laid out a de­tailed plan and went to the gym five times a week.</p>
    <p>“Ex­er­cise is as im­por­tant to me as eat­ing or drinking wa­ter. I will go crazy if I don’t ex­er­cise,” said Mr Ma, who loves swim­ming, cy­cling and kayak­ing</p>
    <p>At the height of the Covid-19 out­break, his com­mu­nity went into lock­down. It af­fected his fit­ness rou­tine be­cause the gym was closed.</p>
    <p>He could do only some push-ups and pull-ups at home or in the fit­ness area of the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“I was very up­set in those days,” he re­called.</p>
    <p>The gym, how­ever, was re­opened in early April. Mr Ma went there on the first day of re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>He feels that his daily life has been “restarted”. He is busy work­ing, study­ing and ex­er­cis­ing ev­ery day. Some­times he goes to a bar­be­cue with friends at night.</p>
    <p>“My life is back on track. I will com­plete the fit­ness plan that I left un­fin­ished. I’m go­ing to step up train­ing. My goal is to gain 10kg,” he said.</p>
