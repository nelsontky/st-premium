    <p>I agree with Dr Wil­liam Wan’s views (Am I my neigh­bour’s keeper? The tragedy of those who die alone, Dec 7). But we also need to ex­am­ine how the au­thor­i­ties and civil or­gan­i­sa­tions act on feed­back re­gard­ing such cases. Let me share my ex­pe­ri­ence in­volv­ing an el­derly neigh­bour and his dis­abled adult son.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, I no­ticed that junk was pil­ing up out­side this fam­ily’s front yard. Their plants and trees were over­grown, and their neigh­bour was com­plain­ing about these. One neigh­bour said she had called the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, which sent of­fi­cers who were de­nied en­try.</p>
    <p>Once, some young peo­ple from a wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tion came and helped clean out the front yard. But the junk piled up again.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily did not have elec­tric­ity or wa­ter. A neigh­bour who was friendly with the el­derly man would some­times go into their house and ask him to do some­thing about his sit­u­a­tion. But the old man was stub­born and re­sisted change.</p>
    <p>The el­derly man is prob­a­bly in his 80s while his son was in his 40s or 50s. Both used walk­ing aids to move around, with the son be­ing much weaker.</p>
    <p>After talk­ing to the neigh­bours and ob­serv­ing the con­di­tions, I called the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment’s hot­line. I was re­ferred to Ang Mo Kio Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre (FSC) and spoke to an of­fi­cer. His ini­tial re­sponse was “oh, that is a pri­vate es­tate” – as if peo­ple in pri­vate es­tates do not face is­sues.</p>
    <p>After more dis­cus­sion, he said the FSC would look into it and would keep me posted.</p>
    <p>After a few days, he came down with an­other of­fi­cer. They tried to talk to the el­derly man, but he was not very co­op­er­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cer called me to tell me that they could not do any­thing be­cause the el­derly man re­fused help.</p>
    <p>We talked about the dan­gers the fam­ily faced. He said that the FSC would con­tinue to mon­i­tor the case. After a few months, I con­tacted the of­fi­cer again. He told me the same thing.</p>
    <p>Early this year, the po­lice came to the house and re­moved the son’s body. The el­derly man was also taken away for sev­eral months and he re­turned only re­cently. Sev­eral peo­ple have since been seen go­ing to the house to help him. The junk in his house was also cleared.</p>
    <p>What was sad was that sin­cere ef­forts were made by neigh­bours to seek help from the au­thor­i­ties and wel­fare agen­cies. And it took a death for con­crete ac­tion to be taken.</p>
    <p>We also need to ex­am­ine how the au­thor­i­ties and civil or­gan­i­sa­tions act on feed­back.</p>
