    <p>Amer­i­can singer Tay­lor Swift has con­firmed in her Dis­ney+ con­cert film that her boyfriend, English ac­tor Joe Al­wyn, con­trib­uted to her songs on Folk­lore un­der the pseu­do­nym Wil­liam Bow­ery.</p>
    <p>“Wil­liam Bow­ery is Joe,” said the singer in Folk­lore: The Long Pond Stu­dio Ses­sions, con­firm­ing months of fan spec­u­la­tion that it was the 29-year-old ac­tor, who has been with Swift, 30, for three years.</p>
    <p>“Bow­ery” was cred­ited in two tracks on her sur­prise July al­bum.</p>
    <p>Swift said Al­wyn wrote the first verse and en­tire pi­ano part on Ex­ile, and orig­i­nally sang the part of the duet that was even­tu­ally recorded by Bon Iver’s Justin Ver­non.</p>
    <p>He also co-wrote the song Betty af­ter she heard him singing “the en­tire fully formed cho­rus from an­other room”.</p>
    <p>In the film, she per­formed songs from the al­bum and dis­cussed its cre­ation un­der lock­down.</p>
    <p>She re­called that Betty was the first time she brought up the idea of the two mak­ing a song to­gether.</p>
    <p>“I was like, ‘Hey, this could be re­ally weird and we could hate this be­cause we’re in quar­an­tine and there’s noth­ing else go­ing on, could we just try to write this song to­gether?’” she said of her con­ver­sa­tion with Al­wyn.</p>
    <p>Folk­lore has been nom­i­nated for six Grammy Awards i nclud­ing Al­bum of the Year, while the song Cardi­gan is up for Best Pop Solo Per­for­mance and Song of the Year.</p>
    <p>Last month, Bill­board re­ported that Folk­lore be­came the first al­bum to sell a mil­lion copies this year.</p>
