    <p>The Straits Times’ edi­tor-at-large Han Kook Kwang’s Sunday Times piece re­minded me that as a city state, our great­est chal­lenges are ahead of us (To­wards a fair and just S’pore in brave new world, Aug 2).</p>
    <p>When I re­cently caught up with re­spected ar­chi­tect and urban plan­ner Liu Thai Ker, he made the point that our suc­cess­ful progress out of poverty to the ranks of the First World car­ries with it a huge risk of lack­ing al­ter­na­tive and ro­bust op­er­at­ing mod­els in all as­pects of so­ci­ety to com­pete and thrive in the post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>In ed­u­ca­tion, for ex­am­ple, the only sys­tem that we have ever known has been so suc­cess­ful that it pre­dictably pro­duced a lim­ited range of out­comes. Mr Liu noted that China, de­spite hav­ing strong cen­tral ad­min­is­tra­tive con­trol and weak in­fra­struc­ture, is ca­pa­ble of pro­duc­ing ex­cep­tional results be­cause of re­gional dif­fer­ences and lo­cal chiefs smartly craft­ing what­ever lit­tle own­er­ship and au­ton­omy such a rigid sys­tem can pro­vide. At the na­tional level, they com­pete vig­or­ously to bring about the best and pro­vide a ba­sis for self-im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar vis­its to Is­rael also taught me the im­por­tance of in­still­ing cu­rios­ity and a ques­tion­ing at­ti­tude from a very young age. The Is­raelis have de­vel­oped tol­er­ance and re­spect for any­one who de­parts from the norms. This trait is key to mak­ing Is­rael an ac­knowl­edged hub of in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>So what is the les­son for us here? With a stronger op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment, we should take this op­por­tu­nity to have a more ro­bust Par­lia­ment that can pro­duce the ex­cep­tional out­comes we are look­ing for. Stay away from the in­cli­na­tion to prove one is right or bet­ter than the other. Rather, all those elected have the re­spon­si­bil­ity of work­ing to­gether to lead the search for the best way for­ward and keep Sin­ga­pore spe­cial.</p>
    <p>The search for ex­cel­lence can be­gin only if we are eter­nally dis­sat­is­fied with the sta­tus quo, no mat­ter how good it may seem. That is the spirit that we have in­her­ited from our found­ing fa­thers and must be made a strong part of our na­tional DNA.</p>
    <p>Our fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­ers and par­lia­men­tar­i­ans have a unique op­por­tu­nity to de­velop this trait, and hope­fully serve as an in­spi­ra­tion to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure to do so may cat­a­stroph­i­cally pave the way for a more se­ri­ous ide­o­log­i­cal di­vide. As a city state, a united peo­ple is our only bet for the fu­ture.</p>
