    <p>So­cial worker Jeremy Lau (Help those who want to turn lives around, July 24) and the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of So­cial Work­ers (Re­hab as im­por­tant as pun­ish­ment, July 31) raised thought-pro­vok­ing points on the is­sues of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and re­cidi­vism.</p>
    <p>In his best-sell­ing au­to­bi­og­ra­phy Trans­formed: A Navy Seal’s Un­likely Jour­ney From The Throne Of Africa, To The Streets Of The Bronx, To De­fy­ing All Odds, ac­tor, writer and film-maker Remi Adeleke re­lates how a US Navy re­cruiter once took a chance on him — de­spite his crim­i­nal record — be­cause she be­lieved Mr Adeleke when he told her that he was con­trite and wanted to turn his life around.</p>
    <p>The re­cruiter per­son­ally ac­com­pa­nied Mr Adeleke to mul­ti­ple court hear­ings to speak in favour of him, and he then went on to join the US Navy and com­plete the in­ten­sive elite US Navy Seal train­ing. Af­ter his mil­i­tary stint, Mr Adeleke’s act­ing ca­reer saw him work with Hol­ly­wood di­rec­tor Michael Bay.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, sim­i­lar sto­ries have been high­lighted in the me­dia: a for­mer con­vict-turned-lawyer who started an out­reach ini­tia­tive to help at-risk youth, a for­mer drug pusher who made it to univer­sity and does good by men­tor­ing at-risk youth, and many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau ar­tic­u­lated it well that it be­hoves a com­pas­sion­ate so­ci­ety to give those who are re­pen­tant and need help turn­ing their lives around the chance to make things right. In the process, this could per­haps trans­form them into en­light­ened and de­voted in­di­vid­u­als who, grate­ful that they were given a sec­ond chance, will pay it for­ward and give back abun­dantly to so­ci­ety.</p>
