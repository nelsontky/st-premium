    <p>I’m happy that he now shows me he’s in­ter­ested in Malay. He can read books smoothly, whereas last time he was al­ways stut­ter­ing and stop­ping.</p>
    <p>MRS NORAFIZAWA­TI AHMAD, whose son Far­rel Fahri Mo­hamad Saf­fari was iden­ti­fied for a Mother Tongue Sup­port Pro­gramme by his school.</p>
    <p>For the first time in his life, Far­rel Fahri Mo­hamad Saf­fari started to ask his mother to speak to him more in Malay.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the Pri­mary 3 boy started ask­ing her for the Malay trans­la­tion of cer­tain English words and telling her new Malay words he learnt in school.</p>
    <p>His mother, Mrs Norafizawa­ti Ahmad, 39, said this grow­ing in­ter­est in his mother tongue lan­guage would have been unimag­in­able last year, when he had dif­fi­cul­ties with Malay.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­where we go we use English; shows and games on gad­gets are also in English. And at home we mainly speak English... so he’s not so good in Malay,” said the as­sis­tant teacher in a pre-school.</p>
    <p>She also has two girls in Pri­mary 6, one of whom prefers English while the other is bet­ter in Malay.</p>
    <p>Be­sides a few sim­ple Malay words, her son pre­vi­ously could not un­der­stand fuller sen­tences, she said. “In pre-school, I had to trans­late Malay sto­ry­books to English, other­wise he wouldn’t un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>But things are look­ing up for Far­rel, ever since he was iden­ti­fied for a Mother Tongue Sup­port Pro­gramme by his school, Yio Chu Kang Pri­mary. His teacher uses re­sources such as pic­ture cards, flash cards and posters to help pupils recog­nise words and learn what they mean.</p>
    <p>They also have hands-on ac­tiv­i­ties like cre­at­ing their own pic­ture cards to learn proverbs.</p>
    <p>Said Mrs Norafizawa­ti: “The teacher gives him more di­rect ques­tions that are eas­ier to un­der­stand, and the lessons have more pic­tures in­stead of just words, which he gets bored by.</p>
    <p>“He used to get mixed up with English and Malay spell­ing be­cause there are some sim­i­lar­i­ties, but he has im­proved.”</p>
    <p>His vo­cab­u­lary has also ex­panded, and he can speak full sen­tences in Malay, which has boosted his con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy that he now shows me he’s in­ter­ested in Malay. He can read books smoothly, whereas last time he was al­ways stut­ter­ing and stop­ping,” said Mrs Norafizawa­ti.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily also spends time at home re­in­forc­ing and build­ing upon what Far­rel learns in school.</p>
    <p>“He’s tak­ing the same Malay lan­guage ex­ams as the rest of his peers, so we also try our best to help him, by slowly ex­plain­ing to him more words and proverbs,” said Mrs Norafizawa­ti. “We also buy him sto­ry­books to read and get him to high­light words he doesn’t un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>Be­ing bilin­gual is im­por­tant, she said, as it helps to main­tain one’s cul­ture and can also be ben­e­fi­cial for work op­por­tu­ni­ties in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Now that ev­ery­thing is in English, and ev­ery­one knows English, know­ing your mother tongue is some­thing spe­cial,” she added.</p>
