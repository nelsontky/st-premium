    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A While I was work­ing in pri­vate bank­ing, I made a cur­rency trade us­ing a 10-year cur­rency op­tion (USD/JPY). It was a high con­vic­tion trade and the idea was that I would have time for it to play out. I ex­e­cuted it with two dif­fer­ent strike prices and got quite lucky within a year.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, I was also very busy and didn’t ded­i­cate the time to mon­i­tor the po­si­tion or define in ad­vance my exit for the trade. I ended up clos­ing the po­si­tion cut­ting my losses to 50 per cent when I could have more than dou­bled my money. It was a painful re­minder that we can all ben­e­fit from pro­fes­sional advice and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A Apart from Bet­terTradeOf­f, my best in­vest­ment is my MBA at Insead. At that time (in 2003), the fees were €42,000 but if you count the op­por­tu­nity cost, it was more than €100,000 in total.</p>
    <p>This was quite an ef­fort then and it took some time to re­im­burse my stu­dent loan.</p>
    <p>What mat­tered is that I took a long-term view on it and this com­mit­ment has paid off mul­ti­ple times, be­yond the fi­nan­cials as well. I was able to tran­si­tion to bank­ing after spend­ing a few years in strat­egy con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>The great­est value, though, is the Insead com­mu­nity, which has been a con­stant source of in­spi­ra­tion and support, open­ing doors to unique op­por­tu­ni­ties and re­sult­ing in a num­ber of very good friends across the world.</p>
    <p>To­day, I have Insead alumni as in­vestors, col­leagues and board mem­bers of Bet­terTradeOf­f.</p>
    <p>I made it a point to support my alma mater fi­nan­cially, but also reg­u­larly spend time in­ter­view­ing can­di­dates, a unique tra­di­tion at the school.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, I met my wife while study­ing at Insead and we de­cided to call Sin­ga­pore our home.</p>
