    <p>Those who have re­cently vis­ited ABC Bar­gain Cen­tre, ValuDol­lar or ABC Ex­press out­lets will have no­ticed that the seem­ingly per­ma­nent signs for sales are nowhere to be seen. Yes­ter­day, the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore said the own­ers and op­er­a­tors of the three brands have vol­un­tar­ily ceased the use of th­ese ad­ver­tise­ments from Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents who have re­cently vis­ited ABC Bar­gain Cen­tre, ValuDol­lar or ABC Ex­press out­lets will have no­ticed that the seem­ingly per­ma­nent “clos­ing down sale” and “fire sale” signs are nowhere to be seen.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore (CCCS) said the own­ers and op­er­a­tors of the three re­tail brands have vol­un­tar­ily ceased the use of th­ese ad­ver­tise­ments from Sept 30.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the CCCS said ad­ver­tise­ments bear­ing such lan­guage con­vey the im­pres­sion that dis­counts are of­fered be­cause the busi­ness is clos­ing down and that the bar­gains are to be had for only a short while.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, The Straits Times re­ported that an ABC Bar­gain Cen­tre out­let in Po­tong Pasir pro­claimed it was hav­ing a “clos­ing down sale” for a pe­riod of al­most two years.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that such ad­ver­tise­ments were dis­played con­tin­u­ously with­out ref­er­ence to an end date at the three re­tail­ers’ out­lets, the CCCS said they could mis­lead con­sumers into be­liev­ing there is a price ben­e­fit avail­able for a lim­ited pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mis­lead­ing con­sumers in such a man­ner con­sti­tutes an un­fair prac­tice in breach of the Con­sumer Pro­tec­tion (Fair Trad­ing) Act (CPFTA), said the con­sumer watch­dog.</p>
    <p>The re­tail­ers have vol­un­tar­ily un­der­taken to re­move all ad­ver­tise­ments pro­claim­ing a “fire sale” at their out­lets.</p>
    <p>They will also not advertise their prod­ucts as be­ing avail­able at a dis­count for a lim­ited pe­riod of time if they know they will be avail­able for longer, or un­less the out­let is gen­uinely clos­ing.</p>
    <p>When no gen­uine price ben­e­fit or ad­van­tage un­der­ly­ing the ad­ver­tise­ment ex­ists, the re­tail­ers also will not advertise their prod­ucts as dis­counted.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, they have to en­sure their fran­chisees are aware of the ad­ver­tis­ing obli­ga­tions as well.</p>
    <p>The re­tail­ers have also agreed to co­op­er­ate with the CCCS on an on­go­ing ba­sis to en­sure that ad­ver­tis­ing obli­ga­tions are met and that they are in com­pli­ance with the CPFTA.</p>
    <p>The watch­dog said it is closely mon­i­tor­ing other busi­nesses that en­gage in sim­i­lar un­fair prac­tices and urged all busi­nesses to en­sure their prac­tices com­ply with the CPFTA.</p>
    <p>On Nov 1, the CCCS’ guide­lines on price trans­parency will come into ef­fect. They pro­vide more clar­ity on con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws and set out fac­tors and cir­cum­stances that the com­mis­sion may con­sider in as­sess­ing if ad­ver­tised prices and re­lated prac­tices are po­ten­tially mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der the CPFTA, the CCCS is em­pow­ered to in­ves­ti­gate er­rant busi­nesses and file in­junc­tion ap­pli­ca­tions against them. If they do not cease the un­fair prac­tice, they can be charged with con­tempt of court, which car­ries a fine of up to $10,000, up to a year’s im­pris­on­ment, or both.</p>
