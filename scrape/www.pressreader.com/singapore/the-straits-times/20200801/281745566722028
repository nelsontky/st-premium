    <p>EX­TENT OF OUT­BREAK UN­CER­TAIN</p>
    <p>They are track­ing or have iso­lated more than 80,000 peo­ple and there is a huge amount of test­ing be­ing done. The un­cer­tainty rests in how far this has spread out in the com­mu­nity, be­cause it’s pretty clear the in­fec­tion prob­a­bly had been in Danang or the re­gion for the last few weeks</p>
    <p>’’ un­de­tected.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR GUY TH­WAITES,</p>
    <p>Ho Chi Minh City-based di­rec­tor of the Ox­ford Univer­sity Clin­i­cal Re­search Unit.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam recorded its first deaths from the coro­n­avirus yes­ter­day, as it shut­tered bars and sus­pended events in its big­gest cities in an ef­fort to con­tain the threat from Danang, the epi­cen­tre of the lat­est out­break.</p>
    <p>The coastal tourism hub logged 82 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, the sin­gle big­gest daily in­crease in coro­n­avirus cases. Many of them were in­di­vid­u­als who had been iso­lated since new com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions were first de­tected last week­end.</p>
    <p>The virus’ first fa­tal­i­ties in Viet­nam were two men, aged 70 and 61 re­spec­tively, who both died in hos­pi­tal in Danang, ac­cord­ing to news re­ports.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this out­break, Viet­nam had not recorded any lo­cal trans­mis­sion for close to 100 days and ap­peared to have emerged from the pan­demic ahead of its South-east Asia peers through a sys­tem of mass quar­an­tine and test­ing.</p>
    <p>With Viet­nam’s bor­ders closed to al­most all for­eign­ers since March, lo­cals had low­ered their guard about wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing in pub­lic. Many also re­dou­bled their hol­i­days around the coun­try on dis­counted air­fares and ho­tel rates of­fered by busi­nesses try­ing to restart the pan­demic-bat­tered tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Danang is now in the mid­dle of a 15-day lock­down, with even take­away food and drink ser­vices sus­pended. The au­thor­i­ties are con­vert­ing a sta­dium into a field hos­pi­tal. All con­struc­tion work in Danang has been halted with ef­fect from yes­ter­day, said lo­cal me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Danang res­i­dent Huynh Viet said the at­mos­phere there was calm.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, peo­ple pan­icked a bit and bought up all the food they could,” the 32-year-old in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy pro­fes­sional told The Straits Times. “But af­ter three days, they have calmed down and are now stay­ing home.”</p>
    <p>In a dis­patch dated Thurs­day, Mr Le Trung Chinh, the vice-chair­man of the Danang peo­ple’s com­mit­tee, said the source of this out­break has still not been iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Guy Th­waites, the Ho Chi Minh City-based di­rec­tor of the Ox­ford Univer­sity Clin­i­cal Re­search Unit, a clin­i­cal and pub­lic health re­search or­gan­i­sa­tion, praised Viet­nam’s gov­ern­ment for re­spond­ing “quickly and de­ci­sively” to this out­break.</p>
    <p>“They are track­ing or have iso­lated more than 80,000 peo­ple and there is a huge amount of test­ing be­ing done,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“The un­cer­tainty rests in how far this has spread out in the com­mu­nity, be­cause it’s pretty clear the in­fec­tion prob­a­bly had been in Danang or the re­gion for the last few weeks un­de­tected.”</p>
    <p>In the nearby tourist haunt of Hoi An, in Quang Nam prov­ince, a sim­i­lar stay-home or­der is in place.</p>
    <p>In the south­ern me­trop­o­lis of Ho Chi Minh City, nightlife es­sen­tially came to a halt from yes­ter­day with the clo­sure of bars and clubs, and the sus­pen­sion of fes­ti­vals, fairs and non-ur­gent meet­ings. Pub­lic gath­er­ings of more than 30 peo­ple are banned, mir­ror­ing sim­i­lar re­stric­tions placed on the cap­i­tal Hanoi ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the pan­demic, Viet­nam has recorded 546 in­fec­tions. min­gling in­doors.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter said the preva­lence of the virus in Eng­land is at one per­son per 1,500, up from one in 2,000 at the start of last month.</p>
    <p>“We can’t af­ford to ig­nore this ev­i­dence,” he said. “Un­less peo­ple fol­low the rules and be­have safely, we may need to go fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>New data pub­lished by the gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day shows that the so-called R num­ber, rep­re­sent­ing how many peo­ple each new Covid-19 pa­tient in­fects, may be above the crit­i­cal thresh­old of 1 in the north-west and south-west of Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Be­yond that level, trans­mis­sion can be­gin to take off ex­po­nen­tially.</p>
