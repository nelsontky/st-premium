    <p>LOS ANGELES • Most Hol­ly­wood pro­duc­tions have shut down again un­til at least the mid­dle of the month, the movie in­dus­try’s act­ing union an­nounced, as Covid-19 cases soar to record lev­els in Los Angeles.</p>
    <p>SAG-Af­tra said the ma­jor­ity of en­ter­tain­ment pro­duc­tions will “re­main on hia­tus un­til the se­cond or third week of Jan­uary if not later,” in a state­ment to mem­bers on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage comes af­ter Los Angeles county health of­fi­cials on Christ­mas Eve urged film-mak­ers to “con­sider paus­ing work for a few weeks dur­ing this cat­a­strophic surge in Covid cases”.</p>
    <p>Los Angeles – the United States’ most pop­u­lous county – has emerged as the lat­est US epi­cen­tre of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, top­ping 7,000 Covid hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions for the first time on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The sprawl­ing county of 10 mil­lion peo­ple has suf­fered nearly 750,000 cases, in­clud­ing just un­der 10,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>South­ern Cal­i­for­nia’s “stay-ath­ome” or­der was ex­tended in­def­i­nitely on Tues­day, with mul­ti­ple hos­pi­tals over­whelmed and forced to turn away am­bu­lances.</p>
    <p>SAG-Af­tra has steered month­s­long ef­forts to restart Hol­ly­wood since its ini­tial March shut­down, co-sign­ing a deal with top stu­dios last Septem­ber to ramp up on-set coro­n­avirus safety mea­sures for its ac­tors, in­clud­ing test­ing.</p>
    <p>Even so, Los Angeles en­ter­tain­ment pro­duc­tions were at l ess than half their usual ac­tiv­ity lev­els last Oc­to­ber, be­fore again de­clin­ing as Covid-19 cases be­gan to soar.</p>
    <p>Film LA, the body that grants per­mits for pro­duc­tions in Los Angeles, said ap­pli­ca­tions to film have re­cently sunk to “lows we have not seen since the weeks af­ter restart of pro­duc­tion last sum­mer”.</p>
    <p>Be­sides a few dozen i ndie movies, very few fea­ture films re­sumed pro­duc­tion in the Los Angeles area last year, with most film­ing ac­tiv­ity re­stricted to com­mer­cials and mu­sic-video shoots.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, high-pro­file pro­duc­tions have re­sumed abroad, in­clud­ing the lat­est Tom Cruise block­buster Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble 7 in Bri­tain and Italy, and tele­vi­sion se­ries such as Su­per­girl and Bat­woman in Canada.</p>
    <p>The lack of coro­n­avirus in­sur­ance con­tin­ues to ham­per pro­duc­tions hop­ing to restart.</p>
    <p>SAG-Af­tra said it would en­sure “ap­pro­pri­ate pre­cau­tions for the hol­i­day hia­tus pe­riod, in­clud­ing ad­di­tional time for test­ing prior to the re­sump­tion of pro­duc­tion”.</p>
