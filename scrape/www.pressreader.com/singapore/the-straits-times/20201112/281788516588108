    <p>WASHINGTON • Tran­si­tion of­fi­cials for United States Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den called on a top Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­pointee to end what they said was un­war­ranted ob­struc­tion of the money and ac­cess that fed­eral law says must flow to the winner of a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials, speak­ing on back­ground to reporters on Mon­day night, said it was nearly un­prece­dented for Ms Emily W. Mur­phy, the ad­min­is­tra­tor of the Gen­eral Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion, to refuse to is­sue a let­ter of “as­cer­tain­ment”, which al­lows Mr Bi­den’s tran­si­tion team to be­gin the trans­fer of power.</p>
    <p>By law, Ms Mur­phy, the head of the sprawl­ing agency that keeps the fed­eral gov­ern­ment func­tion­ing, must for­mally recog­nise Mr Bi­den as the in­com­ing pres­i­dent for his tran­si­tion to be­gin.</p>
    <p>Ms Mur­phy has not acted since news or­gan­i­sa­tions last Satur­day de­clared Mr Bi­den the winner of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The tran­si­tion of­fi­cials said her in­ac­tion was pre­vent­ing the Pres­i­dent-elect’s teams from mov­ing into gov­ern­ment of­fices, in­clud­ing se­cure fa­cil­i­ties where they can dis­cuss clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion. The teams can­not meet their coun­ter­parts in agen­cies or be­gin back­ground checks of top Cabinet nom­i­nees that re­quire top-se­cret ac­cess.</p>
    <p>A White House of­fi­cial pointed out, as sev­eral Trump al­lies have, that the tran­si­tion af­ter the 2000 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion was de­layed over sev­eral weeks by the court fight be­tween the cam­paigns of then Vice-Pres­i­dent Al Gore and Texas Gov­er­nor Ge­orge W. Bush.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial said it would be strange for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to send some kind of a sig­nal to al­low it to start while he is still en­gaged in court fights.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den’s aides said that the dis­pute in 2000 in­volved one state with only about 500 bal­lots sep­a­rat­ing the winner and loser, far less than in the cur­rent con­test.</p>
    <p>In ev­ery other pres­i­den­tial race for the past 60 years, the de­ter­mi­na­tion of a winner was made within 24 hours, they said – even as le­gal chal­lenges and re­counts con­tin­ued for weeks. They said that they were con­sid­er­ing “all op­tions”, in­clud­ing po­ten­tial le­gal ac­tion, to push Ms Mur­phy to let the tran­si­tion be­gin.</p>
    <p>Ms Mur­phy, who de­scribed her­self as “a bit of a wonk” at her Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing in Oc­to­ber 2017, and also said that she was “not here to gar­ner head­lines or make a name for my­self”, so far has cho­sen to side with the White House and Mr Trump, stand­ing be­tween Mr Bi­den’s team and a smooth tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent re­fuses to con­cede the elec­tion and has his cam­paign con­test­ing re­sults in mul­ti­ple states. Most Repub­li­cans have de­clined to recog­nise Mr Bi­den, much less ap­pointees like Ms Mur­phy.</p>
    <p>And so the trans­fer of power that must take place is in limbo.</p>
    <p>Mr Les­lie Dach, who was to lead the tran­si­tion for the Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices had Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton won the pres­i­dency in 2016, said that de­spite the ad­vance work done by Mr Bi­den’s team dur­ing the cam­paign, noth­ing could supplant hav­ing di­rect ac­cess to agen­cies, and that is im­pos­si­ble with­out Ms Mur­phy.</p>
