    <p>The ed­i­tor of The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) said he did not take down an ar­ti­cle con­tain­ing po­ten­tially li­bel­lous al­le­ga­tions about Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong be­cause it was PM Lee’s press sec­re­tary who sent him a let­ter of de­mand in­stead of his lawyers.</p>
    <p>Mr Terry Xu, who is be­ing sued for defama­tion by PM Lee, noted yes­ter­day that another fac­tor in his de­ci­sion not to com­ply was the let­ter be­ing re­leased to the me­dia on the same day.</p>
    <p>As this se­quence of events “de­vi­ated from the norm”, it led him to be­lieve that PM Lee “would want to es­ca­late the mat­ter” even if he com­plied with the let­ter, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Xu added that he would have taken down the ar­ti­cle if the let­ter had come from PM Lee’s lawyers.</p>
    <p>This came up on the third day of the hear­ing, which saw testy ex­changes and heated crosstalk be­tween Mr Xu, his lawyer Lim Tean and Se­nior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, who is rep­re­sent­ing PM Lee.</p>
    <p>The law­suit cen­tres on an ar­ti­cle pub­lished on TOC on Aug 15 last year, which al­leged that PM Lee mis­led his late father, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, into thinking the prop­erty had been gazetted.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh sug­gested that Mr Xu had acted ma­li­ciously when he re­sponded to a let­ter of de­mand from PM Lee’s press sec­re­tary on Sept 1 last year by tak­ing down the ar­ti­cle, be­fore putting it back up on Sept 4 along with a let­ter stat­ing his “moral obli­ga­tion” to “dis­si­pate the cli­mate of fear”.</p>
    <p>The let­ter had de­manded that Mr Xu take down the ar­ti­cle, apol­o­gise and un­der­take not to re­peat the al­le­ga­tions. It stated that should Mr Xu de­cide not to do so, PM Lee would have no choice but to sue.</p>
    <p>But Mr Xu said he did not be­lieve PM Lee would keep to his word.</p>
    <p>“(The let­ter) says if you don’t (com­ply), I’ll sue you. It doesn’t say if you do, we won’t con­tinue with fur­ther ac­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh then asked if it was con­ceiv­able that PM Lee would have gone back on his word and sued Mr Xu nonethe­less, hav­ing made the state­ment pub­licly.</p>
    <p>To this, Mr Xu said that as the head of gov­ern­ment, PM Lee has in­flu­ence over the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs and Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“If I un­der­take the apol­ogy and say what I pub­lished was defam­a­tory, ac­tion may not fol­low legally, but it might fol­low from other statu­tory boards or min­istries,” he added.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing this no­tion as ab­surd, Mr Singh said: “Let me show you how ridicu­lous your ev­i­dence is. It would ap­pear that if this is the kind of prime min­is­ter you think we have, he would take such ac­tion if you apol­o­gised to his press sec­re­tary’s let­ter, but would not do so if you apol­o­gised to his lawyer’s let­ter? That is how ridicu­lous that sug­ges­tion is.”</p>
    <p>Mr Xu dis­agreed, adding that he be­lieved PM Lee was try­ing to in­tim­i­date him by send­ing the let­ter through his press sec­re­tary in­stead of his lawyers.</p>
    <p>Asked by Jus­tice Au­drey Lim if this means a per­son must spend money on a lawyer be­fore Mr Xu would act on a pur­port­edly defam­a­tory ar­ti­cle on TOC, Mr Xu said this was not the case.</p>
    <p>He added: “The dif­fer­ence is that if it was... a com­pany or in­di­vid­ual, I know where the in­di­vid­ual is com­ing from. When you are a per­son in power us­ing his of­fice to is­sue, it some­how in­cites or cre­ates some fresh doubts as to the an­gle he’s ap­proach­ing this mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing this line of rea­son­ing as “in­cred­i­ble”, Mr Singh said: “The fact of the mat­ter is that far from be­ing in­tim­i­dated, you grabbed what you saw as the chance to go af­ter him and en­hance your stand­ing.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Mr Lim Tean had not ques­tioned PM Lee on these sug­ges­tions when he took the stand on Tues­day, Mr Singh said Mr Xu must have “con­cocted” them yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at your re­ac­tion af­ter the press sec­re­tary’s let­ter came, when you made your ar­ti­cle avail­able again and pub­lished your own let­ter on Sept 4, you were ready to take him on,” added Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>“So ev­ery­thing you’ve said about this is a lie.”</p>
