    <p>When Indonesian Elen Retno Bunga Anggraeny moved to Sin­ga­pore in 2017 to be­come a do­mes­tic helper, she had to work for six months with­out salary to pay off $3,000 in agency fees back home.</p>
    <p>Her em­ployer was tem­per­a­men­tal and scolded her of­ten, but Ms Elen pressed on, wor­ry­ing about her debt, she told The Sunday Times via phone from her home­town in Clur­ing, East Java.</p>
    <p>“I was so fright­ened of her yelling that I lit­er­ally peed in my pants. Af­ter three months, I couldn’t take it any­more and quit,” said the 31-year-old.</p>
    <p>She was placed with a sec­ond em­ployer, who was “thank­fully very kind”. But she had to give up two more months’ salary to pay for the trans­fer fees.</p>
    <p>“I went abroad to work to ease eco­nomic hard­ship, but I couldn’t send any money to my fam­ily for eight months,” she said.</p>
    <p>For years, do­mes­tic work­ers like Ms Elen have been left vul­ner­a­ble to abu­sive wage prac­tices by em­ploy­ment agen­cies and the labour bro­kers, re­ferred to as “spon­sors” in In­done­sia, who re­cruit them.</p>
    <p>With no clear ex­pla­na­tion or break­down of cost com­po­nents, many work­ers enter blindly into “po­tong gaji” con­tracts, where the place­ment fees are set­tled through monthly salary de­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>To pro­tect mi­grant work­ers, the Indonesian govern­ment is­sued in July an “ex­emp­tion of place­ment fee pol­icy”, which frees work­ers in 10 job sec­tors, in­clud­ing do­mes­tic helpers, con­struc­tion work­ers and care­givers, from place­ment fees. The pol­icy will come into ef­fect on Jan 15.</p>
    <p>Ms Eva Trisiana, di­rec­tor of place­ment and pro­tec­tion of over­seas work­ers at the Min­istry of Man­power and Trans­mi­gra­tion, said the pol­icy was part of a 2017 law on mi­grant worker pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The pol­icy is to avoid over­charg­ing in the place­ment process for them (work­ers). They find work over­seas to sup­port their fam­i­lies but in­stead, end up los­ing their in­come to pay off debts,” she told The Sunday Times.</p>
    <p>Dr Servu­lus Bobo Riti of BP2MI, the state agency in charge of mi­grant worker pro­tec­tion, said em­ploy­ers in des­ti­na­tion coun­tries will now have to foot the bill.</p>
    <p>Such em­ploy­ers could be govern­ment agen­cies, pri­vate le­gal en­ti­ties or in­di­vid­u­als who hire work­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>He out­lined 12 cost com­po­nents (see table), but was un­able to pro­vide de­tails such as costs.</p>
    <p>“We have com­pleted the tech­ni­cal guide­lines, which we will soon an­nounce to rel­e­vant par­ties and the pub­lic,” he told The Sunday Times.</p>
    <p>While mi­grant worker groups and do­mes­tic work­ers cheered the move, they were wor­ried that for­eign em­ploy­ers would hire work­ers more cheaply from other coun­tries such as Myanmar and Sri Lanka in­stead.</p>
    <p>There are around 127,000 Indonesian do­mes­tic work­ers in Sin­ga­pore, around half the to­tal num­ber of for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>Work­ing abroad al­lows blue-col­lar work­ers to eke out a more com­fort­able liv­ing. A do­mes­tic worker in In­done­sia typ­i­cally earns around 419,700 ru­piah (S$40) a month, ac­cord­ing to the Indonesian statis­tics agency’s Fe­bru­ary data.</p>
    <p>Ms Anis Hidayah, co-founder of Jakarta-based Mi­grant Care, told The Sunday Times: “It’s not right to shift the over­charges from work­ers to em­ploy­ers. The labour bro­kers who take big cuts from the fees paid by work­ers and ex­ploit them are the ones we must elim­i­nate.”</p>
    <p>Ms Iweng Kar­si­wen, co-founder of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Indonesian Mi­grant Work­ers Fam­i­lies, said em­ploy­ment agen­cies and labour bro­kers of­ten in­flate their rates and keep mum about the break­down of fees, which in­clude ac­com­mo­da­tion, flight, med­i­cal check-up and pass­port and visa processing.</p>
    <p>For­mer do­mes­tic worker Arumi Marzudhy, 34, re­counted that two days be­fore de­part­ing for Sin­ga­pore in 2016, the Indonesian em­ploy­ment agency en­tered a new fig­ure of $3,000 in her em­ploy­ment con­tract, dou­bling the agreed fees.</p>
    <p>“They said the ex­tra $1,500 was bank in­ter­est be­cause they had taken a bank loan to cover my ex­penses. This was un­ac­cept­able, this was wrong, I had to fight,” she told The Sunday Times.</p>
    <p>She called a lo­cal man­power of­fi­cial and the agency re­verted to their orig­i­nal agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Indonesian em­ploy­ment agen­cies and labour bro­kers con­tacted by The Sunday Times were up­set by the new pol­icy, say­ing that do­mes­tic work­ers were play­ing the vic­tim when they had been the ones bor­row­ing large sums as “pocket money”.</p>
    <p>A labour bro­ker, who de­clined to be named, said: “I can’t work for free. I have to walk un­der the hot sun, in the rain­storm, for hours to find peo­ple in the vil­lages. Bring­ing them down from the moun­tains to Jakarta, to Sin­ga­pore, costs money.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Elen, the pain of hav­ing to forgo her salary has made her wiser. She said: “When I protested about the high fees then, my bro­ker said ‘It’s okay, at least you’re able to work abroad’, and I left it at that. But now I say: If any­thing goes wrong, be brave to speak up.”</p>
    <p>ELIM­I­NATE LABOUR BRO­KERS</p>
    <p>It’s not right to shift the over­charges from work­ers to em­ploy­ers. The labour bro­kers who take big cuts from the fees paid by work­ers and ex­ploit them are the ones we must elim­i­nate.</p>
    <p>MS ANIS HIDAYAH, co-founder of Jakarta-based Mi­grant Care.</p>
