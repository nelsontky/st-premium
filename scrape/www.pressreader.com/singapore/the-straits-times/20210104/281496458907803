    <p>De­spite the deep­est re­ces­sion since Sin­ga­pore’s in­de­pen­dence in 1965, Sin­ga­pore­ans dipped deep into their pock­ets to give record sums to char­ity through on­line do­na­tion plat­forms last year.</p>
    <p>With the shadow of the pan­demic hang­ing over the na­tion, Giv­ing.sg re­ceived more than $84 mil­lion last year, more than twice the sum it col­lected in 2019.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing.sg is a key on­line do­na­tion web­site run by the Na­tional Vol­un­teer and Phi­lan­thropy Cen­tre (NVPC), and more than 580 char­i­ties use it to raise funds.</p>
    <p>It is also one of the few crowd­fund­ing plat­forms for char­ity here, apart from Give.asia and Ray of Hope.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the NVPC told The Straits Times that $84.4 mil­lion was col­lected be­tween Jan 1 and Dec 30 last year – more than dou­ble the $35.8 mil­lion in the same pe­riod in 2019.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple who signed up as vol­un­teers at var­i­ous char­i­ties through Giv­ing.sg also in­creased from about 28,200 peo­ple be­tween Jan 1 and Dec 30 in 2019 to about 32,100 in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeffrey Tan, NVPC’s direc­tor of mar­ket­ing and ad­vo­cacy, said: “Covid-19 has il­lu­mi­nated the out­pour­ing of gen­eros­ity from Sin­ga­pore­ans, and it was heart­en­ing to see peo­ple, or­gan­i­sa­tions and lead­ers from all walks of life come for­ward to up­lift those in need.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple also gave about $3.5 mil­lion through Ray of Hope to needy fam­i­lies and char­i­ta­ble causes last year – a mas­sive jump from the $550,000 in 2019.</p>
    <p>Its gen­eral man­ager Tan En at­trib­uted the large jump to the gen­eros­ity of peo­ple giv­ing to mi­grant work­ers and Covid-19-re­lated fund-rais­ing cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser said that while the pan­demic hit some seg­ments of so­ci­ety more than oth­ers, it also ap­peared to spark em­pa­thy in those who are bet­ter off for the less for­tu­nate, which could ex­plain the surge in giv­ing.</p>
    <p>Char­i­ties like Free Food For All and Care Sin­ga­pore also col­lected more do­na­tions last year than in 2019.</p>
    <p>Care Sin­ga­pore’s direc­tor of en­ter­prise An­thony Chng said on­line plat­forms make it easy for donors to give, adding: “It lev­els the play­ing field for large and small char­i­ties alike, as the lat­ter may lack brand recog­ni­tion as well as the bud­get to make them­selves more vis­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>But Char­ity Coun­cil chair­man Ger­ard Ee noted that many char­i­ties found it chal­leng­ing to raise funds last year as they could not stage their main­stay events like char­ity din­ners and golf fund-rais­ers on ac­count of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Li­ons Be­frien­ders saw do­na­tions drop more than 30 per cent last year com­pared with 2019, as its ma­jor fund-rais­ers, such as its flag day and an­niver­sary din­ner, were can­celled or post­poned be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Its chair­man An­thony Tay said: “Cor­po­rate and in­di­vid­ual do­na­tions are low­ered sub­stan­tially due to eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and lack of re­sources.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Li­ons Be­frien­ders saw more new vol­un­teers join­ing its cause last year.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Ms Chieng Yu Ding, 42, a se­nior statis­ti­cian. She calls an el­derly woman who lives alone ev­ery week to chat and to check on her well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Ash­leey Leong, 30, and her fi­ance Calvin Lee, 31, bought, packed and de­liv­ered food items such as rice and cook­ing oil to 50 needy fam­i­lies on Dec 27. These 50 fam­i­lies reg­u­larly get help from Free Food For All.</p>
    <p>Ms Leong, an en­tre­pre­neur, said the ex­pe­ri­ence has been an eye­opener. “In­ter­act­ing with the fam­i­lies in­spired fur­ther ideas on how we could do bet­ter, and be­ing on the ground al­lowed us to un­der­stand the chal­lenges these fam­i­lies go through ev­ery day.”</p>
