    <p>The RGB light­ing trend ar­guably reached its peak in May last year. That was when Razer said it would de­velop an RGB toaster, adding to the mul­ti­tude of tech gad­gets that sport these multi-coloured LED lights.</p>
    <p>Hence, I am quite blase about the RGB light­ing in Asus’ new RTAX82U router, although I must ad­mit that the gen­tly puls­ing mul­ti­coloured lights at its front are mes­meris­ing.</p>
    <p>Dubbed the Aura RGB light­ing sys­tem, these LEDs are con­trolled us­ing the Asus Router mo­bile app (avail­able for iOS and An­droid). Seven LED light­ing schemes are avail­able.</p>
    <p>While I do not mind hav­ing these LEDs turned on all the time, some may pre­fer them to be turned off at night. The router lacks a setting to au­to­mat­i­cally turn the LEDs on or off at a spe­cific time daily.</p>
    <p>The AX82U has a fairly fu­tur­is­tic look­ing de­sign, with four up­right, non-re­mov­able an­ten­nas. Its plas­tic chas­sis is light at 740g and can be wall mounted.</p>
    <p>It has a stan­dard con­fig­u­ra­tion of four Gi­ga­bit LAN ports and a USB 3.0 port to con­nect to an ex­ter­nal stor­age drive or printer.</p>
    <p>Mar­keted as a gam­ing router, the AX82U touts sev­eral fea­tures that are geared to­wards its core au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>First, it has a ded­i­cated gam­ing LAN port that au­to­mat­i­cally pri­ori­tises net­work traf­fic from the de­vice con­nected to this port – with­out re­quir­ing the user to man­u­ally change the setting in the app or the router’s Web in­ter­face.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, for smart­phones and tablets that can­not use the ded­i­cated gam­ing port, the AX82U has a one-tap Mo­bile Game Mode that will pri­ori­tise the wire­less con­nec­tion of the mo­bile de­vice that is run­ning the Asus Router app.</p>
    <p>Of course, the router also has a stan­dard adap­tive Qual­ity of Ser­vice fea­ture that lets users pri­ori­tise net­work traf­fic ac­cord­ing to type, such as me­dia stream­ing or file trans­fer.</p>
    <p>Other fea­tures that can be ac­cessed via the app in­clude parental con­trols, the bun­dled AiPro­tec­tion Pro se­cu­rity suite and a host of wire­less set­tings, from chang­ing the DNS server to port for­ward­ing. The app dis­plays these set­tings clearly in a list.</p>
    <p>The router sup­ports the lat­est WiFi 6 stan­dard, also known as 802.11ax. In my usual speed test, which has my Wi-Fi 6 test lap­top placed in the same room – my liv­ing room – as the AX82U, the av­er­age down­load speed recorded was a whop­ping 925Mbps. This is the fastest speed from the Wi-Fi 6 routers I have tested – beat­ing the pre­vi­ous record of 873Mbps set by the TP-Link Deco X20. In fact, the Asus even ex­ceeded 1Gbps oc­ca­sion­ally dur­ing my test.</p>
    <p>But there was a dras­tic drop in speed to around 28Mbps when my test lap­top was moved to a dis­tant bed­room with the door closed. This was far lower than the 100Mbps to 200Mbps speeds I was ex­pect­ing.</p>
    <p>Thus, it would seem that the AX82U’s ra­dio waves lack the range – es­pe­cially with a wooden door in the way – to reach the far­thest part of my home.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this is­sue can be tack­led with the Asus AiMesh fea­ture, which pairs the AX82U with mul­ti­ple Asus AiMesh-com­pat­i­ble routers, to ex­tend the range of the wire­less net­work and elim­i­nate Wi-Fi dead zones.</p>
    <p>Asus has been adding this AiMesh fea­ture to its lat­est as well as older routers. If you al­ready own an Asus router, chances are high that it will sup­port AiMesh.</p>
    <p>At $359, the AX82U is a mid­priced Wi-Fi 6 router with the style and sub­stance to ap­peal to gamers, although it may need the help of an ex­tra router or ex­ten­der if you live in a large or multi-storey home.</p>
