    <p>When Mr For­rest Li first ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore more than 15 years ago, the then 28-year-old was deep in stu­dent loan debt to the tune of $100,000, had next to noth­ing in the bank and made only enough to rent a room in a flat in Brad­dell.</p>
    <p>Today, Mr Li, 43, is the bil­lion­aire founder and group chief ex­ec­u­tive of tech gi­ant Sea, which owns e-com­merce plat­form Shopee and op­er­ates busi­nesses in gam­ing and dig­i­tal fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Mr Li was last night named Busi­ness­man of the Year 2019/2020, in recog­ni­tion of his ef­forts in build­ing Sea into a New York-listed global In­ter­net com­pany with the mis­sion of im­prov­ing the lives of con­sumers and small busi­nesses through tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>He took home the cov­eted ti­tle at the 35th Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Awards (SBA), held at Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ (SPH) News Cen­tre au­di­to­rium and live-streamed yes­ter­day. The SBA is jointly or­gan­ised by SPH pub­li­ca­tion The Busi­ness Times and DHL Ex­press Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Nearly 50 guests at­tended the event, which was held in a hy­brid for­mat for the first time.</p>
    <p>Mr Li said dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion can en­able even a small coun­try like Sin­ga­pore to have a pro­found im­pact on the world. But the ac­cel­er­a­tion of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion can be un­set­tling for many, as the pan­demic cre­ates more ur­gency for com­mu­ni­ties to go on­line, he noted.</p>
    <p>“It is now more crit­i­cal than ever for us to help those who are un­com­fort­able with tech­nol­ogy to learn how to use it, so that no­body is left be­hind. This has al­ways been a con­cern for Sea, and some­thing we will fo­cus more on,” he said in a speech at the event.</p>
    <p>In April, Shopee in­tro­duced a re­gional pro­gramme amid the pan­demic that, among other things, helps small and medium-sized en­ter­prises to at­tract cus­tomers on­line by tem­po­rar­ily low­er­ing ad­min­is­tra­tive fees and pro­vid­ing mar­ket­ing sup­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Li, a nat­u­ralised Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen who hails from Tian­jin in China, also paid trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore’s role in Sea’s suc­cess.</p>
    <p>“There is a stereo­type out there that busi­ness­men come to places like Sin­ga­pore only af­ter they have found suc­cess else­where. That is not my story... Long be­fore I had any suc­cess, (the Sin­ga­porean com­mu­nity) made me feel wel­come, and let me and my fam­ily make our home here,” he said.</p>
    <p>He re­called how he con­nected with Sea’s co-founders David Chen and Ye Gang here and how the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board in­tro­duced them to Sea’s even­tual in­vestor, tech gi­ant Ten­cent.</p>
    <p>“When we were ready to scale, it was again Sin­ga­pore that en­abled us... We built a strong team here, both from lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als and bright young grad­u­ates from the lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Li joins past re­cip­i­ents such as PhillipCap­i­tal Group ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Lim Hua Min and Raf­fles Med­i­cal Group ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Loo Choon Yong.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, NTUC En­ter­prise and FairPrice group chief ex­ec­u­tive Seah Kian Peng, 58, was named out­stand­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive for his ef­forts to en­sure that daily es­sen­tials re­main ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able to Sin­ga­pore­ans amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah told The Straits Times that FairPrice stepped up in ar­eas such as en­sur­ing ad­e­quate sup­plies and pro­tect­ing staff and cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Covid has taught many of us that at the end of the day, ba­sic, es­sen­tial things are what mat­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>The out­stand­ing over­seas ex­ec­u­tive award went to Ms Jes­sica Tan, 42, group co-CEO of China’s fi­nan­cial ser­vices and tech­nol­ogy be­he­moth Ping An In­sur­ance (Group).</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean was recog­nised for her achieve­ments in ris­ing to the top lead­er­ship of Ping An Group, lead­ing its deep dive into tech and over­see­ing its de­vel­op­ment as a tech­nol­ogy-pow­ered re­tail fi­nan­cial ser­vices group.</p>
    <p>Main­board-listed AEM Hold­ings won the en­ter­prise award. Over the past nine years, it has trans­formed it­self from a niche au­to­ma­tion com­pany to a global semi­con­duc­tor and elec­tron­ics test so­lu­tions provider.</p>
    <p>The firm has mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of about $1 bil­lion and em­ploys some 600 staff glob­ally, of whom about half are in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Wei Kong, chair­man of the SBA or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee and edi­tor of The Busi­ness Times, said: “Un­der the bleak and un­pre­dictable cli­mate that the pan­demic has brought upon ev­ery­one, these four win­ners demon­strated true tenac­ity and in­no­va­tion in their busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>DHL Ex­press Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing direc­tor Christo­pher Ong said the win­ners showed ex­em­plary for­ti­tude and in­ge­nu­ity in steer­ing their busi­nesses through the coro­n­avirus cri­sis. “Their re­mark­able ste­ward­ship al­lowed their busi­nesses to con­tinue to thrive even in such a chal­leng­ing cli­mate.”</p>
