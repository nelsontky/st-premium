    <p>DUBAI/BEIRUT • The United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) could rein­tro­duce a de facto overnight cur­few in some ar­eas of the coun­try if there are a high number of Covid-19 in­fec­tions there, a govern­ment of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The Gulf Arab state has seen the number of cases rise this week to more than 400 for the first time since mid-July, in­clud­ing 461 in­fec­tions and two deaths in the 24 hours to Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Asked if the national ster­il­i­sa­tion pro­gramme, which had in­cluded a night-time cur­few, could again be en­forced, National Emer­gency Cri­sis and Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment Au­thor­ity spokesman Seif al-Zahri told Emi­rates TV: “Yes, that’s pos­si­ble in cer­tain ar­eas where we ob­serve high in­fec­tion cases.”</p>
    <p>The busi­ness and tourism hub on June 24 lifted a na­tion­wide cur­few in place since mid-March and com­mer­cial busi­nesses and pub­lic venues have grad­u­ally re­opened.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Ab­dul Rah­man Bin Mo­hammed al-Owais on Tues­day warned that the number of cases could rise af­ter an alarm­ing in­crease over the pre­vi­ous two weeks.</p>
    <p>The UAE has recorded 65,802 in­fec­tions and 369 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, still reel­ing from a deadly port blast that rav­aged their Beirut homes and busi­nesses, Le­banese wearily braced them­selves for a new coro­n­avirus lock­down yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“What now? On top of this dis­as­ter, a coro­n­avirus catas­tro­phe?” said 55-year-old Rox­ane Moukarzel, as she waved to­wards the dev­as­tated port from the bal­cony of her gut­ted home.</p>
    <p>Le­banon is to par­tially close down for two weeks from yes­ter­day to stem a string of record daily in­fec­tions that have brought the number of Covid-19 cases to 10,952, in­clud­ing 113 deaths.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties fear Le­banon’s frag­ile health sec­tor would strug­gle to cope with a fur­ther spike in Covid-19 cases, es­pe­cially af­ter some hos­pi­tals near the port were dam­aged in the ex­plo­sion.</p>
    <p>They have said the new lock­down mea­sures, which in­clude a night­time cur­few from 6pm to 6am, will not af­fect the clean-up or aid ef­fort in ar­eas rav­aged by the blast.</p>
    <p>The stay-at-home or­der is only the l at­est such de­ci­sion af­ter a months-long lock­down from midMarch.</p>
