    <p>Malaysia’s lat­est po­lit­i­cal tur­moil, trig­gered by op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s bid to claim the premier­ship, has thrown up an un­likely king­maker – Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ah­mad Zahid, the pre­vi­ous deputy premier in the scandal-hit ad­min­is­tra­tion of former prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak, heads the most pow­er­ful fac­tion in deeply di­vided Umno and how he plays his cards in the com­ing days will de­ter­mine the longevity of Prime</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s ad­min­is­tra­tion as well as whether Datuk Seri An­war suc­ceeds in his bid for the coun­try’s top post.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a late Tues­day evening emer­gency meet­ing, Umno’s po­lit­i­cal bureau, a pow­er­ful wing con­trolled di­rectly by Mr Zahid, threat­ened that the party was se­ri­ously con­sid­er­ing pulling out of the Muhyid­din-led Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion un­less Umno se­cured bet­ter terms.</p>
    <p>It did not dis­close its de­mands, but the blunt re­marks re­leased in a state­ment by the party’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ah­mad Maslan were widely viewed as a sign that Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s hold on power might yet slip.</p>
    <p>Datuk Ab­dul Kadir Jasin, the former me­dia ad­viser to the gov­ern­ment, noted that the Umno state­ment “di­rectly lent cur­rency to claims by Mr An­war” that the Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment had lost its ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno holds about a third of the seats in Mr Muhyid­din’s PN coali­tion that wrested power in March fol­low­ing a se­ries of de­fec­tions that brought down the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment, an­other coali­tion headed by</p>
    <p>Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>The PN coali­tion has a ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment – with just 113 MPs in the 220-seat Lower House – and that slim ad­van­tage has come un­der se­ri­ous doubt in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The ran­cour dis­played by Mr Zahid’s Umno fac­tion to­wards the Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment is in sharp con­trast to the sen­ti­ment ex­pressed by the party leader as Mr An­war made his bid for the premier­ship.</p>
    <p>When the op­po­si­tion leader pub­licly de­clared late last month that he had se­cured a for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity from elected MPs, Mr Zahid is­sued a state­ment as Umno pres­i­dent and chair­man of the long­stand­ing mul­tira­cial Barisan Na­sional coali­tion that he was aware of the un­hap­pi­ness among sev­eral politi­cians un­der his charge and would not pre­vent them from throw­ing their sup­port be­hind Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>The state­ment re­leased late on Tues­day was seen as yet an­other sub­tle boost for the An­war cam­paign, which suf­fered a set­back only hours ear­lier when the King’s palace is­sued a state­ment say­ing the op­po­si­tion leader had dis­closed the num­ber of MPs al­legedly sup­port­ing him, but did not pro­vide the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, with a de­tailed list of who they were.</p>
    <p>That raised doubts about whether Mr An­war ac­tu­ally had the num­bers.</p>
    <p>To be sure, there has been spec­u­la­tion in Malaysian po­lit­i­cal cir­cles that groups aligned to Mr Zahid and Na­jib, who jointly com­mand the loy­alty of at least 20 Umno MPs, had in re­cent months pri­vately pledged their sup­port for Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>The bulk of Mr An­war’s sup­port comes from rep­re­sen­ta­tives of his own Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR), the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party and Parti Amanah Ne­gara, which to­gether form the back­bone of the PH coali­tion.</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day, Mr An­war claimed that he had in­formed</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah that he had the sup­port of more than 120 MPs.</p>
    <p>Close as­so­ciates of Mr An­war said that he has been re­luc­tant to re­veal the iden­ti­ties of the MPs from out­side the PH coali­tion, par­tic­u­larly those from Umno, over con­cerns that forces aligned with the cur­rent gov­ern­ment could move to ca­jole or even co­erce them to re­con­sider their po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they had hoped that the doubts over Mr An­war’s bid af­ter his au­di­ence with Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah would be cleared when Mr Zahid went be­fore the King, an au­di­ence that was orig­i­nally sched­uled for to­day.</p>
    <p>That meet­ing has since been post­poned in­def­i­nitely due to the move­ment con­trol mea­sures im­posed to counter the re­cent spike in the num­ber of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The An­war-Zahid po­lit­i­cal combo does not come as a sur­prise to sup­port­ers of both politi­cians. Mr Zahid was one of Mr An­war’s staunch­est sup­port­ers dur­ing the 1990s when the lat­ter was emerg­ing as the politi­cian most likely to suc­ceed then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir.</p>
    <p>When Mr An­war fell out with his boss in 1998 and was sub­se­quently jailed on charges of sex­ual mis­con­duct, Mr Zahid was also briefly de­tained un­der the coun­try’s tough se­cu­rity laws and sub­se­quently thrown into the po­lit­i­cal wilder­ness.</p>
    <p>But his close ties to Na­jib, who then had emerged as a politi­cian des­tined for na­tional lead­er­ship, paved the way for his re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion in Umno.</p>
    <p>Over the years, both politi­cians have re­mained close de­spite be­ing on dif­fer­ent sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide, with Mr An­war us­ing his chief po­lit­i­cal lieu­tenant, PKR sec­re­tary-gen­eral Sai­fud­din Na­su­tion, who is also a long-time per­sonal friend of the Umno pres­i­dent, as the go-be­tween, ac­cord­ing to politi­cians and busi­ness­men who know Mr Zahid and the PKR pres­i­dent well.</p>
    <p>The state­ment re­leased late on Tues­day was seen as yet an­other sub­tle boost for the An­war cam­paign, which suf­fered a set­back only hours ear­lier when the King’s palace is­sued a state­ment say­ing the op­po­si­tion leader had dis­closed the num­ber of MPs al­legedly sup­port­ing him, but did not pro­vide the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, with a de­tailed list of who they were. That raised doubts about whether Mr An­war ac­tu­ally had the num­bers.</p>
