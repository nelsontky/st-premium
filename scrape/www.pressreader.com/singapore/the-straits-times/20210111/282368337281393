    <p>Cor­po­rate Amer­ica is part­ing with its CEO pres­i­dent – care­fully.</p>
    <p>Four years after Mr Don­ald Trump swept into the White House, cow­ing ex­ec­u­tives and shak­ing mar­kets with tweet storms and tantrums, cor­po­ra­tions that ap­plauded when he cut taxes and red tape are strug­gling to come to grips with the havoc that’s now fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>After Mr Trump in­cited a mob of loy­al­ists to storm the Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day, prom­i­nent busi­ness fig­ures swiftly con­demned the vi­o­lence – with­out men­tion­ing the Pres­i­dent by name. Only one ma­jor busi­ness group, the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Man­u­fac­tur­ers, sin­gled him out. Even as the</p>
    <p>Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion comes to its chaotic end, with calls for the Pres­i­dent to be im­me­di­ately re­moved from of­fice, the busi­ness world is step­ping del­i­cately.</p>
    <p>When Mr Trump ar­rived in Washington, he could sway a com­pany with a tweet. Now Face­book has sus­pended his ac­count, at least through the end of his term, while Twit­ter has banned him per­ma­nently. Shopify, the Cana­dian com­pany be­hind many e-com­merce sites, said on Thurs­day that it had closed two on­line stores that sell red MAGA hats and other Trump para­pher­na­lia.</p>
    <p>“That’s how quickly the worm turns,” said Ms Davia Temin, founder of New York City cri­sis con­sul­tancy Temin and Co. “One needs to make a dis­tinc­tion be­tween Trump the Pres­i­dent, who you may or may not have made any com­ments about over the last four years, and the sedi­tion, the at­tack on the Capi­tol that hap­pened yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.”</p>
    <p>Even now, few of the re­sponses chal­lenge Mr Trump di­rectly. The Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Man­u­fac­tur­ers, which is typ­i­cally seen as sup­port­ive of Repub­li­can poli­cies, urged Mr Trump’s</p>
    <p>Cabi­net to con­sider oust­ing him, us­ing their au­thor­ity of the 25th Amend­ment to the US Con­sti­tu­tion, which al­lows such ac­tion when a pres­i­dent is deemed un­fit to serve. Ice-cream maker Ben & Jerry’s Home­made blasted him in an eight-part tweet, sum­ming it up with a call for him to re­sign or for the gov­ern­ment to re­move him. But most of the con­dem­na­tion was more gener­i­cally fo­cused on “elected of­fi­cials” for their role in per­pet­u­at­ing the po­si­tion that the elec­tion was fraud­u­lent and en­cour­ag­ing the anger that boiled over into the deadly storm­ing of the cen­tre of the US gov­ern­ment. Like the pow­er­ful, evil wiz­ard Volde­mort in a Harry Pot­ter book, Mr Trump was the pro­tag­o­nist who was not named. “To­day marks a sad and shame­ful chap­ter in our na­tion’s his­tory,” Ap­ple chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tim Cook said in a Wed­nes­day tweet. ‘Those re­spon­si­ble for this in­sur­rec­tion should be held to ac­count, and we must com­plete the tran­si­tion to Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion. It’s es­pe­cially when they are chal­lenged that our ideals mat­ter most.”</p>
    <p>The CEOs of IBM, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Dell Tech­nolo­gies, Cisco Sys­tems, United Par­cel Ser­vice, and Gen­eral Mo­tors made sim­i­lar state­ments force­fully con­demn­ing the events with­out men­tion­ing any politi­cian by name. The Busi­ness Roundtable, which is ex­clu­sively open to CEOs, blamed the vi­o­lence on “elected of­fi­cials’ per­pet­u­a­tion of the fiction of a fraud­u­lent 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>The heads of Wall Street’s big­gest firms, from JPMor­gan Chase & Co and Black­stone Group to Gold­man Sachs and Black­Rock, also called for an end to the vi­o­lence. So did the CEO of Palan­tir Tech­nolo­gies, which in­cludes Trump sup­porter Peter Thiel among its founders.</p>
    <p>It’s a tough sit­u­a­tion for com­pa­nies, which even as they have be­come com­fort­able tak­ing po­si­tions on so­cial is­sues, are less con­di­tioned to di­rect in­volve­ment in a US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, said man­age­ment pro­fes­sor Fred Foulkes at the Bos­ton Univer­sity Que­strom School of Busi­ness. As an ex­am­ple, Amer­i­can Elec­tric Power, which is rep­re­sented on the board of the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Man­u­fac­tur­ers, dis­tanced it­self from the di­rect call for Mr Trump’s ouster. “We did not con­trib­ute to the NAM state­ment and did not vote on or ap­prove it as a NAM mem­ber,” the com­pany said in a state­ment. It con­demned the vi­o­lence in a sep­a­rate state­ment. “If you’re one of these big com­pany CEOs, it’s kind of ex­pected that you say some­thing now,” Mr Foulkes said. “We’re sort of get­ting to the point where if some­one isn’t com­ment­ing, you won­der ‘why not?’”</p>
    <p>Mis­souri Sen­a­tor Josh Haw­ley, who led Repub­li­can ef­forts to chal­lenge Mr Joe Bi­den’s cer­ti­fi­ca­tion as pres­i­dent last week, has al­ready faced reper­cus­sions. Pub­lisher Si­mon & Schus­ter can­celled plans to re­lease his book, The Tyranny Of Big Tech, cit­ing his role in the tu­mult.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the vi­o­lence on Wed­nes­day, the ma­jor­ity of 33 large-com­pany CEOs were in agree­ment that Mr Trump was at­tempt­ing to over­turn a demo­crat­i­cally run elec­tion and that mem­bers of Congress who were as­sist­ing him were “aid­ing and abet­ting sedi­tion”, said Pro­fes­sor Jef­frey Son­nen­feld, se­nior as­so­ciate dean for lead­er­ship stud­ies at the Yale School of Man­age­ment. He polled the ex­ec­u­tives on the topic on Tues­day in a hastily called “cri­sis cau­cus” of mem­bers of the Yale Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Lead­er­ship In­sti­tute. The ex­ec­u­tives were unan­i­mous in say­ing that CEOs should warn lob­by­ists pri­vately that their firms will no longer sup­port “elec­tion re­sult de­niers” in Congress. It was the first unan­i­mous poll in 30 years for the group, span­ning 105 sum­mits and a hand­ful of other cri­sis meet­ings, Mr Son­nen­feld said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>But with less than two weeks be­fore Mr Trump leaves of­fice, it’s prob­a­bly too late for firms to speak out di­rectly against him, said Ms Temin. She has been ad­vis­ing clients to fol­low the play­book of con­demn­ing the vi­o­lence with­out sin­gling out the Pres­i­dent. “If you haven’t made a whole se­ries of com­ments through­out this four-year pe­riod, I do not be­lieve this is the time to start,” she said. “Now is the time to re-eval­u­ate your cor­po­rate pur­pose, how that in­ter­acts with our democ­racy, and be on­board in the next ad­min­is­tra­tion in a con­struc­tive way.”</p>
