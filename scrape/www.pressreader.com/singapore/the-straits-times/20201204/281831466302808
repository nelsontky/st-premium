    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is mak­ing all the right noises about be­ing a leader for all Amer­i­cans; a uni­fier who will bridge the United States’ toxic po­lit­i­cal di­vide.</p>
    <p>But he will be tak­ing power next month as the sep­a­rate uni­verses of the di­vide keep spin­ning even fur­ther apart.</p>
    <p>This week pro­vided am­ple ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion process is near­ing of­fi­cial cul­mi­na­tion. Mr Bi­den’s tran­si­tion teams are work­ing with gov­ern­ment agen­cies; he him­self is get­ting of­fi­cial daily in­tel­li­gence brief­ings.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s le­gal team con­tin­ues to pur­sue court cases aimed at ex­pos­ing al­leged ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties, but to date has not won any. And on Tues­day, At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr, long de­rided by Democrats as a Trump lackey, told The As­so­ci­ated Press that no ev­i­dence of fraud had been seen that could change the out­come of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet, in a 46-minute state­ment from the White House on Wed­nes­day, in what Mr Trump de­scribed as “maybe the most im­por­tant speech I’ve ever made”, he in­sisted that ev­i­dence ex­ists of mas­sive fraud. “We won, with­out ques­tion,” the Pres­i­dent said.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, dur­ing a Christ­mas re­cep­tion at the White House, the Pres­i­dent re­port­edly told as­sem­bled guests that he plans to run again in 2024, some­thing long-spec­u­lated. “It’s been an amaz­ing four years. We are try­ing to do an­other four years. Oth­er­wise, I’ll see you in four years,” he was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Some of this is about bar­gain­ing, said Dr Vasab­jit Ban­er­jee, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor in the depart­ment of po­lit­i­cal sci­ence and pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion at Mis­sis­sippi State Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“He needs to make his threat to stay in power cred­i­ble; this means he has to raise the heat to get an exit ramp,” he said.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump faces sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges, in­clud­ing los­ing me­dia plat­forms. An­other is that other Repub­li­cans may be eye­ing 2024.</p>
    <p>Dr Glenn Altschuler, pro­fes­sor of Amer­i­can stud­ies at Cor­nell Univer­sity, said: “The more he is front and cen­tre the more he takes the oxy­gen away from them; you have prom­i­nent Repub­li­cans who seek for one rea­son or an­other to move on.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump will also lose the pre­rog­a­tive and plat­form of the pres­i­dent, and ma­jor me­dia am­pli­fiers such as Fox News may have less in­cen­tive to spend air­time on him.</p>
    <p>On Dec 14, state elec­tors will meet and vote for the pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent – nor­mally in line with how their states voted. On Jan 6, those votes will be counted in a joint ses­sion of Congress. By the lat­est count, Mr Bi­den will get 306 – well above the 270 that con­sti­tutes a ma­jor­ity. Mr Trump will have 232.</p>
    <p>The writ­ing may be on the wall, yet a ma­jor­ity of Mr Trump’s sup­port­ers be­lieve he is the right­ful win­ner of the elec­tion – an im­pres­sion cre­ated, and stoked, by the Pres­i­dent him­self and right-wing al­lies.</p>
    <p>Those voices may get more shrill in the me­dia – if mostly lim­ited to right-wing echo cham­bers as many con­ser­va­tives, an­gered at what they see as the lib­eral bias of Twit­ter and Face­book, mi­grate to other plat­forms where views can be ex­pressed with lit­tle or no ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude me­dia plat­forms such as Par­ler, News­max and</p>
    <p>One Amer­ica News Net­work; the lat­ter two have been en­dorsed openly by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>This, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts, will only re­in­force the al­most mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive re­al­i­ties, and the an­tipa­thy, of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide – even rais­ing the risk of rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion and po­lit­i­cal vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>This week, a Trump cam­paign lawyer said a fed­eral of­fi­cial who de­fended the in­tegrity of the elec­tion should be shot.</p>
    <p>And Ge­or­gia elec­tion of­fi­cial Gabriel Ster­ling (a Repub­li­can), in an im­pas­sioned press con­fer­ence, cited threats to elec­tion work­ers and of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“Some­one’s go­ing to get killed.</p>
    <p>And it’s not right. It’s not right,” Mr Ster­ling said.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a group call­ing it­self the “We The Peo­ple Con­ven­tion” in a full-page ad­ver­tise­ment in the Wash­ing­ton Times called the</p>
    <p>Nov 3 elec­tion re­sult “fraud­u­lent” and urged the Pres­i­dent to “im­me­di­ately de­clare a lim­ited form of mar­tial law, and tem­po­rar­ily sus­pend the Con­sti­tu­tion and civil­ian con­trol of th­ese fed­eral elec­tions, for the sole pur­pose of hav­ing the mil­i­tary over­see a re-vote”.</p>
    <p>The ad­ver­tise­ment raised many eye­brows – not least be­cause former gen­eral Michael Flynn, the na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser in the early days of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, called at­ten­tion to it in a tweet.</p>
    <p>Mr Flynn re­signed in 2017 and ad­mit­ted to ly­ing to the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion about his con­tacts with a Rus­sian diplo­mat. He re­ceived a pres­i­den­tial par­don last month. In a press brief­ing on Wed­nes­day, White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany did not com­ment on the ad­ver­tise­ment but called Mr Flynn “a valiant hero who served his coun­try both on the bat­tle­field and then in gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>On Jan 20, on the steps of the Capi­tol, Mr Bi­den will take charge in th­ese com­bustible cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be a very dan­ger­ous time,” said Mr San­ford Un­gar, di­rec­tor of the Free Speech Project at Ge­orge­town Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“The stakes are so very high. His theme of con­cil­i­a­tion in a way is no­ble, but risky. One risk is that he may be per­ceived as weak. Bi­den is go­ing to be walk­ing on eggshells.”</p>
