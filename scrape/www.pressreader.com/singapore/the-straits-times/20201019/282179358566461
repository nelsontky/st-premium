    <p>I ap­plaud labour MP Melvin Yong for propos­ing that Sin­ga­pore im­ple­ment a “Right to</p>
    <p>Dis­con­nect” law (MP calls for law to guar­an­tee work­ers the rest they need, Oct 15).</p>
    <p>It has been re­ported that more work­ers are stressed from work­ing longer hours when work­ing from home (More work­ing from home feel stressed than those on Covid-19 front line, Aug 20).</p>
    <p>While there may be a lot of short-term ad­van­tages and op­por­tu­ni­ties in work­ing re­motely to de­velop em­ploy­ment-friendly job skills (like flex­i­bil­ity, adapt­abil­ity, time man­age­ment and multi-task­ing), I be­lieve that in the long term, we have far more to lose.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple sim­ply don’t multi-task well so our at­ten­tion is con­stantly di­vided. That re­sults in gaps, mis­takes and po­ten­tially life-and-death ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>It is un­sus­tain­able to com­part­men­talise work from fam­ily and per­sonal com­mit­ments, es­pe­cially with the new work norms now.</p>
    <p>The work-from-home model has com­pletely blurred the lines be­tween work and per­sonal life, and cre­ated sig­nif­i­cant down­sides. Em­ploy­ers now call, text and e-mail their staff far more than ever be­fore.</p>
    <p>Many, for fear that their staff are skiv­ing at home, over-com­pen­sate and in­un­date their em­ploy­ees with mes­sages 24/7.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers are rid­ing on the trend as an ex­cuse to pour more work on their ex­hausted staff, know­ing well that they have an up­per hand, thanks to the flood of job seek­ers in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This pan­demic is a wake-up call to re-ex­am­ine what val­ues our so­ci­ety holds as we move into un­charted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>At the very least, even if the still po­lit­i­cally-cor­rect no­tions of pro­duc­tiv­ity and ef­fi­ciency are touted as rea­sons to blur the lines be­tween work and play while work­ing from home, the right of em­ploy­ees to dis­con­nect should be up­held with­out threat­en­ing their liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge is to con­vince em­ploy­ers that it’s in their best in­ter­ests to have happy, well-ad­justed staff; and for em­ploy­ees, that it’s okay to not feel guilty when of­fi­cial work hours are over and we’ve shut down our com­mu­ni­ca­tion de­vices.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is, are we pre­pared to take what seems to be a step back­wards in terms of pro­duc­tiv­ity in or­der to re­gain our right to dis­con­nect?</p>
