    <p>Bank lend­ing in Sin­ga­pore in Au­gust fell for the sixth straight ses­sion over the month, pre­lim­i­nary data from the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore showed yes­ter­day. This was largely driven by weaker busi­ness lend­ing.</p>
    <p>Loans through the do­mes­tic bank­ing unit, which cap­tures lend­ing in all cur­ren­cies but re­flects mainly Sin­ga­pore-dol­lar lend­ing, stood at $678 bil­lion in Au­gust, com­pared with $679 bil­lion a month ago.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness lend­ing stood at $423 bil­lion, down 0.4 per cent from a month ago. The growth in loans to man­u­fac­tur­ers and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions nar­rowed from a month ago. Loans to the hefty fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions seg­ment fell 2.1 per cent in Au­gust from a month ago to $101 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The sin­gle largest busi­ness lend­ing seg­ment – that is, to the builders – how­ever, held up. Loans to the con­struc­tion in­dus­try con­tin­ued to grow, up 0.8 per cent in Au­gust over the month to $150 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer loans growth stayed in pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory. In Au­gust, it lifted 0.3 per cent from a month ago to $255 bil­lion, pushed in part by a sharp jump in share fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Share fi­nanc­ing was up 13.7 per cent in Au­gust from a month ago to $1.75 bil­lion, re­vers­ing from a month-on-month de­cline in July.</p>
    <p>The slight boost in con­sumer lend­ing was de­spite mort­gages con­tract­ing month on month since Fe­bru­ary this year. Hous­ing and bridg­ing loans stood in Au­gust at $199 bil­lion, con­tract­ing 0.1 per cent over the month.</p>
    <p>From a year ago, to­tal lend­ing in Au­gust fell 1 per cent, mark­ing the third con­sec­u­tive weak­en­ing since June. Busi­ness loans in Au­gust were flat from a year ago, with gains in con­struc­tion-re­lated loans off­set by weaker lend­ing to the man­u­fac­tur­ing, trade and fi­nanc­ing busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer loans have been shrink­ing year on year since May last year, in lock­step with the straight con­trac­tions in mort­gages over the same pe­riod.</p>
