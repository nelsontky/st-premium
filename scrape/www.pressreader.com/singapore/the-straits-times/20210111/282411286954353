    <p>CHAR­LOTTE • LaMelo Ball may just be the best out of the three Ball broth­ers.</p>
    <p>Older brother Lonzo, 23, was the No. 2 pick in the 2017 Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) draft and cur­rently plays for the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans, while LiAn­gelo, 22, is a free agent, but the Balls have of­ten been over­shad­owed by the brash me­dia per­son­al­ity that is their fa­ther LaVar.</p>
    <p>LaVar has made many claims in the past, in­clud­ing boast­ing Lonzo as a col­lege fresh­man was al­ready “bet­ter than Steph Curry”.</p>
    <p>Many of them have since been laughed off but last year’s as­ser­tion that LaMelo was his most tal­ented son as his “other two have to stay in their lane” looks to be on point this early into the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old rookie, who was se­lected third in Novem­ber’s NBA draft by the Char­lotte Hor­nets, be­came the youngest player in league his­tory to score a triple-dou­ble as his team beat the Atlanta Hawks 113-105 on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The 2.03m point guard came off the bench to record 22 points, 12 re­bounds and 11 as­sists, while team­mate Terry Rozier added a game­high 23 points as the hosts im­proved to 5-5 this sea­son.</p>
    <p>He beat Or­lando Magic guard Markelle Fultz, the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft, as the youngest NBA player to post a triple-dou­ble by 177 days.</p>
    <p>LaMelo, who was an as­sist short of a triple-dou­ble in the Hor­nets’ pre­vi­ous game, has al­ready made an im­pres­sion de­spite pri­mar­ily be­ing used as a re­serve so far, with an av­er­age of 12.8 points, 5.9 as­sists and 6.3 re­bounds per game this sea­son. Com­par­a­tively, the Min­nesota Tim­ber­wolves’ An­thony Ed­wards, who was the No. 1 pick in Novem­ber, is av­er­ag­ing 15.1 points, 2.1 as­sists and 2.6 re­bounds.</p>
    <p>Char­lotte coach James Bor­rego said of LaMelo: “A 19-year-old rookie does not look like this. This is rare what you’re see­ing.</p>
    <p>“He’s not rat­tled by the mo­ment. It’s like he’s been do­ing this for a num­ber of years.”</p>
    <p>While LaMelo is en­ter­ing his first year in the NBA, he has al­ready been play­ing pro basketball for some time. Two years ago, he opted to skip col­lege basketball to play a sea­son in Aus­tralia’s Na­tional Basketball League with the Illawarra Hawks, a spell he cred­its as hav­ing aided his de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Atlanta’s All-Star guard Trae Young, who con­trib­uted 15 points, is im­pressed by his po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>“He’s a tall PG who can pass, can re­bound and he’s a smart player,’’ he said. “Things are go­ing to be­come even eas­ier for him in this league as he plays more games.”</p>
    <p>The Hor­nets have never won a cham­pi­onship and have not made the play-offs since 2015-16, so reach­ing the post-sea­son is their main tar­get this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>LaVar is adamant their chances will be greatly im­proved if LaMelo is start­ing.</p>
    <p>On his son, who is the fifth rookie in NBA his­tory to record a triple-dou­ble and the first Hor­nets player to do it com­ing off the bench, LaVar said: “I never seen that be­fore in my life. That’s like telling Michael Jack­son, ‘Hey man, you com­ing on sec­ond’.”</p>
    <p>LaMelo shares that same con­fi­dence in his abil­ity. “I live my life and I know what I’m ca­pa­ble of, so stuff like this doesn’t move me like that,” he said. “I know that’s sup­posed to hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Bos­ton Celtics for­ward Jayson Ta­tum will spend the next 10 to 14 days in quar­an­tine as part of the NBA’s Covid-19 pro­to­cols, ac­cord­ing to The Ath­letic.</p>
    <p>His team, who are sec­ond in the East with a 7-3 record, are ex­pected to be ex­tremely short­handed for yes­ter­day’s home match-up with last sea­son’s NBA fi­nal­ists Mi­ami Heat due to play­ers in quar­an­tine and in­juries.</p>
