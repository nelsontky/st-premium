    <p>Rents and the vol­ume of leases for both Hous­ing Board flats and con­do­minium units rose last month for the sec­ond month run­ning, ac­cord­ing to flash data from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty that was re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The HDB rental vol­ume rose 13.9 per cent month on month to an es­ti­mated 1,734 units last month, from 1,523 the month be­fore.</p>
    <p>The rental vol­ume for con­do­mini­ums climbed by 6.3 per cent month on month. An es­ti­mated 4,409 units found ten­ants, com­pared with 4,148 in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said the in­crease in rental vol­umes could partly be at­trib­uted to the re­stric­tions on de­vel­op­ers reis­su­ing op­tions to pur­chase (OTPs) that were an­nounced on Sept 28.</p>
    <p>Un­der the terms of a stan­dard OTP, buy­ers of new pri­vate homes have three weeks to book their right to pur­chase a prop­erty from a de­vel­oper in re­turn for a cash down pay­ment, which is up to 5 per cent of the price of the unit.</p>
    <p>A buyer who does not ex­er­cise the right to buy may for­feit 25 per cent of the book­ing fee.</p>
    <p>But some de­vel­op­ers had been reis­su­ing OTPs to buy­ers, giv­ing them more time to line up the funds needed to make the pur­chase and avoid pay­ing ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD).</p>
    <p>“As most buy­ers have not been granted an ex­ten­sion of their OTPs, some have sold their homes to avoid pay­ing the ABSD when they pur­chased a new con­do­minium. They have sub­se­quently rented a unit while they wait for the com­ple­tion of their new home,” Ms Sun said.</p>
    <p>HDB rents inched up 0.7 per cent from Septem­ber, and 0.8 per cent year on year. They are still down 13.7 per cent from their peak in Au­gust 2013.</p>
    <p>Condo rents edged up 0.3 per cent from Septem­ber, and by the same rate year on year. They are 16.8 per cent lower than their peak in Jan­uary 2013.</p>
    <p>Year on year, the rental vol­ume for HDB flats is still down by 12.1 per cent, and 8.9 per cent lower than a five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month.</p>
    <p>As for con­dos, the to­tal num­ber of leases is 4.1 per cent lower than in Oc­to­ber last year, but 5.8 per cent higher than a five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun noted there is still con­sid­er­able un­cer­tainty in the econ­omy and the em­ploy­ment out­look re­mains weak for many sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“The global eco­nomic weak­ness may ne­ces­si­tate more job cuts,” she said, adding that a fur­ther re­duc­tion in for­eign em­ploy­ment will hurt the leas­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, the rental vol­ume may be slightly lower in 2021, dip­ping about 5 per cent year on year. Rents may dip around 2 to 4 per cent next year.”</p>
