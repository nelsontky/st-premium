    <p>KABUL • An Afghan jour­nal­ist has been shot dead in a car am­bush in the cen­tral prov­ince of Ghor, the fifth me­dia pro­fes­sional to be killed in the coun­try in two months, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Bis­mellah Adel Ai­maq, ed­i­tor-in-chief of Sada-e-Ghor (Voice of Ghor) ra­dio sta­tion, was killed near Firoz Koh city, the cap­i­tal of Ghor, on Fri­day. No one has claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for the killing.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, Bis­mellah Adel Ai­maq, the head of Sada-e Ghor Ra­dio, was killed by un­known gun­men this evening in Firoz Koh.</p>
    <p>“He was 28 years old, and started work­ing with Sada-eGhor Ra­dio in 2015,” said Mr Habi­bol­lah Rad­manesh, the deputy gover­nor of Ghor.</p>
    <p>Afghan Pres­i­dent Ashraf Ghani con­demned the killing and said his govern­ment was com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing and pro­mot­ing free­dom of ex­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“The Tale­ban and other ter­ror­ist groups could not si­lence the le­git­i­mate voices of jour­nal­ists and the me­dia by car­ry­ing out such at­tacks,” he said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>A civil so­ci­ety ac­tivist was also killed on Fri­day by un­known mil­i­tants.</p>
    <p>Tar­geted killings of jour­nal­ists, govern­ment of­fi­cials and rights ac­tivists have in­creased rapidly in re­cent months as vi­o­lence surges in Afghanista­n de­spite peace talks be­tween the govern­ment and the Tale­ban.</p>
    <p>The Tale­ban stated last month that it was not in­volved in the killing of me­dia pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
