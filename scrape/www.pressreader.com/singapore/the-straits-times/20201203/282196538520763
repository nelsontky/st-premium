    <p>Women who need help deal­ing with sex­ual as­sault, fam­ily vi­o­lence, work­place ha­rass­ment or other types of vi­o­lence can now turn to a new web­site.</p>
    <p>The por­tal, dubbed Aware­ness, Con­nect, Take Pre­cau­tion, or A.C.T. Against Vi­o­lence, has de­tails about who vic­tims can con­tact and where they can get help.</p>
    <p>Launched by the Sin­ga­pore Coun­cil of Women’s Or­gan­i­sa­tions (SCWO) on Mon­day it also has in­for­ma­tion for women and con­cerned cit­i­zens about the types and cy­cle of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>At the launch event at the SCWO head­quar­ters in Water­loo Street, Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment and for Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing said: “The Gov­ern­ment is de­ter­mined to tackle the is­sue of fam­ily vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>“This is why the Task­force on Fam­ily Vi­o­lence, com­pris­ing pub­lic agen­cies, the courts and com­mu­nity part­ners such as hos­pi­tals, fam­ily vi­o­lence spe­cial­ist cen­tres, cri­sis shel­ters and fam­ily ser­vice cen­tres, was set up ear­lier this year to create aware­ness of the is­sue, and pro­vide bet­ter sup­port to vic­tims.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said com­mu­nity part­ner­ships were im­por­tant in the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to keep ev­ery woman in Sin­ga­pore safe.</p>
    <p>In her speech, she also cited fig­ures from the Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts, which last year re­ceived more than 2,400 ap­pli­ca­tions for per­sonal pro­tec­tion or­ders against abu­sive fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>About three-quar­ters of the ap­pli­ca­tions were made by women.</p>
    <p>“Through the web­site, women ex­pe­ri­enc­ing vi­o­lence can re­ceive more in­for­ma­tion, and make more in­formed choices to ad­dress their sit­u­a­tion,” Ms Sun said.</p>
    <p>She added that by­standers and pro­fes­sion­als can also visit the web­site and be equipped with the nec­es­sary re­sources to bet­ter sup­port vic­tims of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>SCWO pres­i­dent Ju­nie Foo said the new site serves as a one-stop re­source for all things re­lated to vi­o­lence against women.</p>
    <p>She said: “The plat­form is aimed at in­creas­ing the aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing of dif­fer­ent forms of abuse.</p>
    <p>“We worked with the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment and the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs in piec­ing to­gether es­sen­tial in­for­ma­tion and helplines to aid vic­tims and the com­mu­nity to take pre­cau­tions against vi­o­lence.”</p>
    <p>The web­site’s launch comes amid a spike in cases of vi­o­lence against women this year.</p>
    <p>The SCWO saw a 10 per cent in­crease in callers re­quest­ing as­sis­tance dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>From April 7 to May 6, 476 po­lice re­ports were filed for of­fences com­monly as­so­ci­ated with fam­ily vi­o­lence – 22 per cent higher than the monthly av­er­age of 389 be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
