    <p>MADONNA SHARES RARE PHO­TOS OF TWIN DAUGH­TERS:</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can pop diva Madonna may be a con­tro­ver­sial icon, but her chil­dren prob­a­bly see a very dif­fer­ent side of the Queen of Pop.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Madonna,</p>
    <p>62, shared on so­cial me­dia a rare group photo of her with her six chil­dren. It was likely taken dur­ing the Thanks­giv­ing week­end.</p>
    <p>The Ma­te­rial Girl singer then got her first tat­too on her wrist: the let­ters LRDMSE, which are the ini­tials of her six chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Madonna had Lour­des Leon, 24, with ex-boyfriend, ac­tor Car­los Leon; and Rocco Ritchie, 20, with ex-hus­band, di­rec­tor Guy Ritchie. David Ritchie, 15, was adopted from Malawi.</p>
    <p>She also adopted Mercy James, 14, and twins Stella and Estere, both eight, from Malawi. Stella and Estere were adopted from an cel­e­brated Hanukkah, the Jewish Fes­ti­val of Lights.</p>
    <p>The singer posted more pho­tos of the twins as well as of their el­der sis­ter Mercy yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Like A Vir­gin singer had ear­lier posted a video of Mercy tak­ing pho­tos of the sis­ters with the cap­tion: “Pro­fes­sional pho­tos taken by the one and only –</p>
    <p>Mercy James”.</p>
    <p>Madonna’s four-decade ca­reer as a singer, ac­tress and cul­tural touch­stone has taken on top­ics such as sex and reli­gion and other tra­di­tional taboos, and the star an­nounced in Septem­ber that she will be di­rect­ing and co-writ­ing a biopic about her life and mu­sic.</p>
    <p>The star, who is dat­ing dancer Ah­la­ma­lik Wil­liams, 26, said in</p>
    <p>May that she had been in­fected by the coron­avirus dur­ing her</p>
    <p>Paris con­cert tour in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
