    <p>SEOUL • South Korea or­dered doc­tors in the Seoul area to re­turn to work yes­ter­day, warn­ing of tough con­se­quences as med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers be­gan a three-day strike in protest against sev­eral gov­ern­ment pro­pos­als, in­clud­ing one to boost the num­ber of doc­tors to deal with health crises such as the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Stern ac­tion has been promised by Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in, who or­dered a re­sponse “based on prin­ci­ples of law... to bring the doc­tors back to the ta­ble”.</p>
    <p>“There can be no com­pro­mise when lives and safety of peo­ple are at stake,” said Mr Moon.</p>
    <p>Trainee doc­tors have been stag­ing on­go­ing walk­outs, and thou­sands of ad­di­tional doc­tors were due to stage a three-day strike start­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said it would re­port the strik­ing doc­tors to a state reg­u­la­tory body and might also sus­pend or re­voke their li­cences to prac­tise medicine af­ter three rounds of talks ended without a deal. Crim­i­nal charges could also be pur­sued against the doc­tors if med­i­cal ser­vices are dis­rupted and pa­tients suf­fer from ne­glect.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment now has no choice but to take nec­es­sary le­gal ac­tions such as an or­der to open busi­ness to not put the cit­i­zens’ lives and safety in dan­ger,” Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo said in a brief­ing. He said the Korean Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion (KMA) and the Korean In­tern Res­i­dent As­so­ci­a­tion (Kira) had re­jected sev­eral of the gov­ern­ment’s of­fers.</p>
    <p>The strikes come as South Korea bat­tles one of its worst out­breaks of the coro­n­avirus, with 320 new cases re­ported in the 24 hours to midnight on Tues­day, the lat­est in more than 11/ weeks of triple-digit</p>
    <p>2 in­creases.</p>
    <p>The walk­outs yes­ter­day forced South Korea’s five ma­jor gen­eral hos­pi­tals to limit their hours and de­lay sched­uled surg­eries, Yon­hap news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the week, the doc­tors reached an agree­ment with the gov­ern­ment to con­tinue to han­dle coro­n­avirus pa­tients, but failed to find a com­pro­mise on the broader is­sues.</p>
    <p>KMA said the med­i­cal com­mu­nity was al­ways open to all pos­si­bil­i­ties in talks with the gov­ern­ment, and that the doc­tors did not want to have to strike. “We sin­cerely do want to re­turn. We ask you cit­i­zens to lis­ten to our voice so we can meet our pa­tients as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>KMA and Kira mem­bers have said they op­pose gov­ern­ment plans to boost the num­ber of med­i­cal students over sev­eral years, es­tab­lish pub­lic med­i­cal schools, al­low gov­ern­ment in­sur­ance to cover more ori­en­tal medicine and in­tro­duce more telemedici­ne op­tions.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said its goal to in­crease the num­ber of med­i­cal students by 4,000 over the next 10 years is nec­es­sary to bet­ter pre­pare for pub­lic health crises like the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent doc­tors, how­ever, said the plan would un­nec­es­sar­ily flood an al­ready com­pet­i­tive mar­ket and that the ex­tra fund­ing would be bet­ter spent im­prov­ing the salaries of ex­ist­ing trainees, which would en­cour­age them to move out of Seoul to ru­ral ar­eas where more health pro­fes­sion­als are needed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a South Korean of­fi­cial said the gov­ern­ment is dis­cussing what would need to hap­pen to raise anti-virus mea­sures to the strictest level, but dis­missed ru­mours that such a pol­icy would be an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoon Tae-ho, a se­nior Health Min­istry of­fi­cial, said in a brief­ing that the gov­ern­ment will mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion this week be­fore de­cid­ing whether to strengthen so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to Level 3, from Level 2 cur­rently.</p>
