    <p>In­vestors around the re­gion took flight yes­ter­day on grim news sur­round­ing Brexit, a resur­gence in Covid-19 cases in Europe and the lack of progress on United States stim­u­lus mea­sures.</p>
    <p>It was no sur­prise that the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) took a hit and ex­tended its losses from Wed­nes­day. The in­dex fell 31.97 points, or 1.25 per cent, to close at 2,523.62, with losers out­num­ber­ing gain­ers 271 to 167 on trade of 1.27 bil­lion shares worth $1.28 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries emerged top in the STI per­for­mance ta­ble, gain­ing 4.41 per cent to $1.42, fol­lowed by Kep­pel Corp, which inched up 1.34 per cent to $4.54.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change said yes­ter­day that Kep­pel DC Reit, the largest stock on the STI re­serve list as at Wed­nes­day, is sched­uled to join the in­dex on Mon­day as Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust will be deleted in prepa­ra­tion for its merger with Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional was top de­cliner of the day among the STI con­stituents, shed­ding 6.44 per cent to $4.36.</p>
    <p>The trio of lo­cal banks also ended the day in the red. OCBC Bank fell 1.26 per cent to $8.63, United Over­seas Bank de­clined 1.22 per cent to $19.46 and DBS Bank re­treated 1.17 per cent to $21.07.</p>
    <p>Asian mar­kets also ended down. The Nikkei 225 In­dex slipped 0.51 per cent while the bench­mark Kospi fell for a third straight ses­sion, clos­ing down 0.81 per cent.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai stocks fell 0.26 per cent after Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s key­note ad­dress in Shen­zhen on Wed­nes­day failed to fuel the coun­try’s share rally.</p>
    <p>Oanda se­nior market an­a­lyst Jef­frey Hal­ley called the speech “heavy on rhetoric, but light on new ini­tia­tives and at the end, not mar­ket­mov­ing for Asia at all”.</p>
    <p>The surge in in­fec­tions in Europe is adding to the down­beat mood on trad­ing floors given fears that gov­ern­ments will be forced to re­vert to tough mea­sures that could de­liver a blow to a ten­ta­tive re­cov­ery from na­tional lock­downs ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“The Euro­pean Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has been de­te­ri­o­rat­ing again this week and more and more coun­tries are in­tro­duc­ing strict con­tain­ment mea­sures,” said Go­rilla Trades strate­gist Ken Ber­man.</p>
    <p>“France, Spain, Italy, the UK, and Ger­many are all un­der pres­sure, and since the re­cent eco­nomic re­leases al­ready showed wor­ri­some trends, the con­tin­gent might be head­ing for a rough win­ter.”</p>
