    <p>LON­DON • Fans of J.K. Rowl­ing’s Fan­tas­tic Beasts se­ries will al­ready be fa­mil­iar with nif­flers, oc­camy and demigu­ise, while uni­corns, dragons and mer­maids have been the stuff of le­gends for cen­turies.</p>
    <p>Now, Lon­don’s Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum has scoured its vast col­lec­tion for an ex­hi­bi­tion to cel­e­brate strange beasts in all their forms, in­clud­ing those cre­ated by the Harry Pot­ter au­thor.</p>
    <p>Fan­tas­tic Beasts: The Won­der Of Na­ture is a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the mu­seum, the BBC and Warner Bros, and comes as the venue re­opens af­ter months of pan­demic-en­forced clo­sure.</p>
    <p>The show prom­ises to plunge vis­i­tors straight into a world well known to Harry Pot­ter fans, where they learn about “ma­g­i­zo­ol­o­gist” Newt Sca­man­der, the sto­ries’ lead­ing au­thor­ity on fan­tas­tic beasts.</p>
    <p>The 2001 book was turned into a hit fan­tasy film fran­chise star­ring Ed­die Red­mayne. His cos­tume is also fea­tured in the ex­hi­bi­tion, which runs un­til Au­gust next year.</p>
    <p>The head of con­ser­va­tion at the Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum, Ms Lor­raine Cor­nish, said cu­ra­tors looked at the char­ac­ter­is­tics of</p>
    <p>Rowl­ing’s in­ven­tions and com­pared them with their own col­lec­tion. Then they short­listed more than 100 spec­i­mens for the show.</p>
    <p>“By tak­ing some of these fan­tas­tic beasts peo­ple have en­joyed watch­ing on film or read­ing in the books, we’ve been able to high­light some of the fan­tas­tic beasts that ac­tu­ally ex­ist in the real world today,” she said. “I think it will give the au­di­ence an ex­tra insight into the amaz­ing world of na­ture.”</p>
    <p>The first part of the ex­hi­bi­tion looks at the an­i­mals in­cluded in the books, such as the nif­fler, which re­sem­bles a platy­pus and whose pen­chant for shiny things makes it a good trea­sure hunter.</p>
    <p>An oc­camy is de­scribed as a plumed, two-legged winged crea­ture with a ser­pen­tine body, while a demigu­ise is a peace­ful her­bi­vore that can make it­self in­vis­i­ble and pre­dict the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Also fea­tured are dragons, uni­corns and mer­maids, which are more well known in pub­lic con­scious­ness.</p>
    <p>A skele­ton of an 8m-long deepsea oarfish – which fu­elled myths of huge sea ser­pents – is fea­tured, as are gi­ant nar­whal tusks.</p>
    <p>They are ex­hib­ited along­side the uni­corn hair-in­fused wands of Harry Pot­ter’s friend Ron Weasley and his ri­val Draco Mal­foy.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors will also be able to ex­plore the ex­tra­or­di­nary abil­i­ties, be­hav­iours and prop­er­ties of real an­i­mals, such as mat­ing rit­u­als and meth­ods of cam­ou­flage. For ex­am­ple, a demigu­ise’s abil­ity to dis­ap­pear has been likened to that of but­ter­flies which can dis­guise them­selves as leaves for pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The real world is in many ways weirder, stranger and more fan­tas­ti­cal than any­thing in our imag­i­na­tion can cover,” said cu­ra­tor Louis Buck­ley. “There are lots of ex­am­ples of that within the show. To ac­tu­ally see that... and un­der­stand a bit more how amaz­ingly adapt­able an­i­mals are is truly breath­tak­ing.”</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 12 fan­tas­tic beasts from the world of wiz­ardry are an­a­lysed, which the mu­seum hopes will help trans­form its dusty im­age and pique the cu­rios­ity of newer, younger au­di­ences. It has said the ex­hi­bi­tion will even­tu­ally go on tour to a num­ber of coun­tries.</p>
