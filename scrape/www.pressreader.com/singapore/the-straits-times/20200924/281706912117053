    <p>A new busi­ness travel pass is be­ing pi­loted for se­nior ex­ec­u­tives in Sin­ga­pore with re­gional or in­ter­na­tional re­spon­si­bil­i­ties who need to travel reg­u­larly for of­fi­cial and busi­ness pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers on this pass, which is not coun­try-spe­cific, will be re­quired to abide by a strict, con­trolled itin­er­ary when they travel abroad for work, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Upon re­turn, the trav­eller will be given the op­tion to take a Covid-19 test in lieu of serv­ing a stay-home no­tice, and to self-iso­late un­til the test re­sults are out, it added.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said the num­ber of passes will be strictly lim­ited in the ini­tial phase to en­sure that pub­lic health out­comes of this pi­lot can be mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>“If the pi­lot is suc­cess­ful, and pub­lic health mea­sures are fully abided by, we will con­sider ex­pand­ing the scheme in a safe and cal­i­brated man­ner,” said MOH.</p>
    <p>The lat­est an­nounce­ment comes af­ter the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore said in June that stud­ies were be­ing done to see how busi­ness travel could be fa­cil­i­tated in a safe and cal­i­brated man­ner.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force, said dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that more de­tails will be shared by the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But in essence, the travel pass will al­low a trav­eller to visit “quite a wide range of coun­tries”, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>He added: “It’s not go­ing to be coun­try-spe­cific, we will al­low those with the travel pass to be able to travel.</p>
    <p>“But, of course, these trav­ellers will have to com­ply with what­ever travel re­stric­tions or mea­sures that are in place in that coun­try that they are vis­it­ing.”</p>
    <p>There may also be other re­stric­tions un­der other travel schemes, such as bi­lat­eral travel ar­range­ments like the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane (RGL) schemes, which trav­ellers have to pay heed to, added Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>Un­der the RGL ar­range­ments that Sin­ga­pore has with Malaysia, Brunei and Ja­pan, trav­ellers must, for ex­am­ple, un­dergo pre-de­par­ture and post-ar­rival Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests, and abide by a pre-de­clared con­trolled itin­er­ary dur­ing their visit.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the new busi­ness travel pass be­ing pi­loted will not su­per­sede these re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“The idea is to be able to al­low se­nior ex­ec­u­tives who are based in Sin­ga­pore with ex­ten­sive re­gional or in­ter­na­tional re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to have a bit more flex­i­bil­ity to travel for their work rea­sons,” he said.</p>
