    <p>China will take “nec­es­sary mea­sures” to safe­guard the in­ter­ests of its com­pa­nies af­ter the New York Stock Ex­change (NYSE) be­gan delist­ing three Chi­nese tele­com firms that Wash­ing­ton says have mil­i­tary ties, China’s Com­merce Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The NYSE last Thurs­day said it would delist China Mo­bile, China Uni­com and China Tele­com, fol­low­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s move in Novem­ber to bar Amer­i­can in­vest­ment in 31 firms that Wash­ing­ton says are owned or con­trolled by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>“This kind of abuse of na­tional se­cu­rity and state power to sup­press Chi­nese firms does not com­ply with mar­ket rules and vi­o­lates mar­ket logic,” the Chi­nese Min­istry of Com­merce said yes­ter­day in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“It not only harms the le­gal rights of Chi­nese com­pa­nies, but also dam­ages the in­ter­ests of in­vestors in other coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States,” it added.</p>
    <p>While the min­istry said it will take ac­tion to pro­tect its firms, it also called on the US to meet China half­way and put bi­lat­eral trade re­la­tions back on track.</p>
    <p>In its fi­nal weeks be­fore Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice on Jan 20, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has stepped up its hard­line stance against China.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment added dozens of Chi­nese com­pa­nies to a trade black­list l ast month, ac­cus­ing Bei­jing of us­ing its firms to har­ness civil­ian tech­nolo­gies for mil­i­tary pur­poses.</p>
    <p>The NYSE said late on Thurs­day that it would halt trad­ing in shares of China Mo­bile, China Uni­com and China Tele­com by Jan 11. The Depart­ment of De­fence had pre­vi­ously listed the three com­pa­nies as hav­ing sig­nif­i­cant con­nec­tions to Chi­nese mil­i­tary and se­cu­rity forces.</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tive or­der is­sued in Novem­ber by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion was part of a broader ef­fort by Wash­ing­ton to weaken the ex­ten­sive eco­nomic links be­tween the US and China, in­clud­ing Chi­nese ac­cess to Wall Street money.</p>
    <p>The move is likely to have lit­tle ef­fect on China’s mil­i­tary or se­cu­rity am­bi­tions, which are gen­er­ously funded by Bei­jing, or on the com­pa­nies them­selves, which can raise money by sell­ing shares in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Still, the delist­ing of the three tele­com gi­ants re­flects China’s rise in power and wealth. It also high­lights the fal­ter­ing of long-es­tab­lished busi­ness ties be­tween the US and China, which were set up over decades as China sought to in­ter­na­tion­alise and re­form its state-run cor­po­rate be­he­moths.</p>
    <p>All three com­pa­nies op­er­ate un­der Bei­jing’s firm con­trol. They are ul­ti­mately owned by a govern­ment agency, the state-owned As­sets Su­per­vi­sion and Ad­min­is­tra­tion Com­mis­sion, and are of­ten or­dered to pur­sue Bei­jing’s goals.</p>
