    <p>Even as trade re­mains mud­died by ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism and a re­ces­sion-in­duc­ing pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to con­sol­i­date its po­si­tion as a ma­jor node in the global sup­ply chains that lead in and out of Asia.</p>
    <p>In less than a month, Sin­ga­pore joined the world’s big­gest mul­ti­lat­eral re­gional trade part­ner­ship and then signed its maiden free trade agree­ment (FTA) with the world’s sixth-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The new deals – the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship signed on Nov 15 and the UK-Sin­ga­pore Free Trade Agree­ment (UKSFTA) inked yes­ter­day – add to the Repub­lic’s al­ready ex­ten­sive net­work of bi­lat­eral and free trade agree­ments.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore now has a to­tal of 27 FTAs – 12 re­gional and 15 bi­lat­eral.</p>
    <p>The fact that the sum of ex­ports and im­ports of goods and ser­vices mea­sured as a share of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) stands at about 300 per cent ex­plains why it is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue ex­pand­ing its trade net­work.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits to Sin­ga­pore-based com­pa­nies are also ob­vi­ous. These agree­ments en­sure lower tar­iffs and pref­er­en­tial treat­ment when it comes to non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers and quo­tas for se­lect in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, un­der the UKSFTA, tar­iffs will re­main elim­i­nated for 84 per cent of all tar­iff lines for</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ex­ports to the United King­dom. Vir­tu­ally all of the re­main­ing tar­iffs will be elim­i­nated by Nov 21, 2024.</p>
    <p>The UKSFTA will con­tinue to pro­vide for lib­eral and flex­i­ble rules of ori­gin for the two coun­tries’ key ex­ports to each other’s mar­kets, in­clud­ing vehicles, chem­i­cals, cloth­ing and tex­tiles, elec­tron­ics, ma­chin­ery, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and petro­chem­i­cals.</p>
    <p>Boost­ing trade is not as straight­for­ward as it used to be, even as most ex­perts still recog­nise that eco­nomic pros­per­ity lies in fa­cil­i­tat­ing the move­ment of goods and ser­vices from where they are pro­duced to where they are most needed.</p>
    <p>While the pace of global trade growth had been on a down­hill path since the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis – fur­ther dragged down by the United States-China trade war – the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­came the ul­ti­mate test of the re­silience of global sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>Doubts were also cast on the sus­tain­abil­ity of free trade as the fear of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion and run on es­sen­tial sup­plies amid</p>
    <p>na­tion­wide lock­downs reignited calls for more pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>At the on­set of the pan­demic, sev­eral na­tions placed curbs on ex­ports of food and other es­sen­tial goods.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore – one of the top global sup­pli­ers of key phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­gre­di­ents and other med­i­cal sup­plies and equip­ment – kept its sup­ply chains open.</p>
    <p>In April, it an­nounced, jointly with New Zealand, the launch of the Dec­la­ra­tion on Trade in Es­sen­tial Goods for Com­bat­ing the Covid-19 Pan­demic. By June, a dozen other na­tions from across the world, in­clud­ing China, had joined the ini­tia­tive to main­tain cross-bor­der flows of ne­ces­si­ties, in­clud­ing food and medicine.</p>
    <p>A se­nior ex­ec­u­tive of a multi­na­tional lo­gis­tics com­pany, talk­ing to The Straits Times re­cently, con­firmed that in April, when most North Asian coun­tries had re­stricted the flow of goods and sup­plies, Sin­ga­pore be­came the re­gion’s key lo­ca­tion from where it kept sup­ply­ing the world with masks, per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and med­i­cal de­vices.</p>
    <p>So to many peo­ple in the busi­ness of trade and lo­gis­tics, it came as no sur­prise when Sin­ga­pore was ranked the world’s sec­ond-most con­nected coun­try in this year’s edi­tion of the DHL Global Con­nect­ed­ness In­dex.</p>
    <p>The in­dex – com­piled by Deutsche Post DHL Group and the New York Univer­sity Leonard N. Stern School of Busi­ness – is based on a de­tailed anal­y­sis of over 3.5 mil­lion data points that tracks the flow of goods, cap­i­tal, in­for­ma­tion and peo­ple in 169 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s trade part­ners re­spect the Repub­lic’s po­si­tion on free and rule-based trade and un­der­stand its im­por­tance in the global and re­gional sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Sec­re­tary of State for In­ter­na­tional Trade, Ms El­iz­a­beth Truss, in an interview with ST, said the FTA with Sin­ga­pore is not just to en­sure con­ti­nu­ity of the £17 bil­lion (S$30 bil­lion) bi­lat­eral trade, but also to move to­wards a dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ment (DEA) that will help the UK di­ver­sify its sup­ply chains for ser­vices.</p>
    <p>She said the UK sees Sin­ga­pore as a key part­ner and ad­vo­cate of free trade and seeks its sup­port to join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP) – a vi­tal part of the UK’s trade strat­egy to get ac­cess to the £9 tril­lion GDP area that the treaty rep­re­sents.</p>
    <p>“The Asia-Pa­cific is ob­vi­ously a fast-grow­ing dy­namic re­gion that the UK wants to be more closely in­volved in. But do­ing so is also strate­gi­cally im­por­tant in terms of mak­ing the case glob­ally for free trade and against the ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ist rhetoric,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has been a lead­ing voice in free trade and we are keen to work with Sin­ga­pore and other like-minded al­lies in the Asia-Pa­cific to make that case against pro­tec­tion­ism.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I think the sig­nal of the UK join­ing the CPTPP will be re­ally pos­i­tive in help­ing turn the tide on pro­tec­tion­ism.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also un­der­stands how to broaden the scope of its re­la­tion­ship with its key trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>Its Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing said at the sign­ing cer­e­mony yes­ter­day that a UK-Sin­ga­pore DEA could ad­dress mod­ern trade is­sues, in­clud­ing cross-bor­der data con­nec­tiv­ity for the re­spec­tive fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tors, which are key pil­lars for both economies.</p>
    <p>“The DEA would strengthen the link­ages be­tween Sin­ga­pore and the UK as global dig­i­tal hubs, and fa­cil­i­tate dig­i­tal trade for the fu­ture. In fact, our vi­sion is for Sin­ga­pore and the UK to be the twin hubs for our re­spec­tive re­gions, that Sin­ga­pore will be able to serve the re­gion and UK busi­nesses can use Sin­ga­pore as a plat­form to serve and ac­cess the re­gion,” he said.</p>
