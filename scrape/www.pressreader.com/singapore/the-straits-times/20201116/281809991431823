    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Four as­tro­nauts were poised to l aunch on the SpaceX Crew Dragon “Re­silience” to the In­ter­na­tional Space Sta­tion (ISS) yes­ter­day, the first of what the US hopes will be many rou­tine mis­sions fol­low­ing a suc­cess­ful test flight in late spring.</p>
    <p>Three Amer­i­cans – Mr Michael Hop­kins, Mr Vic­tor Glover and Ms Shan­non Walker – and Ja­pan’s Mr Soichi Noguchi were sched­uled to blast off at 7.27pm yes­ter­day (8.27am to­day Sin­ga­pore time) from the Kennedy Space Cen­tre in Florida.</p>
    <p>In May, SpaceX com­pleted a demon­stra­tion mis­sion show­ing it could take as­tro­nauts to the ISS and bring them back safely, thus end­ing al­most a decade of Amer­i­can re­liance on Rus­sia for rides on its Soyuz rock­ets.</p>
    <p>“The his­tory be­ing made this time is we’re launch­ing what we call an op­er­a­tional flight to the In­ter­na­tional Space Sta­tion,” Nasa ad­min­is­tra­tor Jim Bri­den­s­tine told re­porters last Friday.</p>
    <p>The launch will be at­tended by Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and his wife, Karen Pence.</p>
    <p>The crew will dock at their des­ti­na­tion at around 12pm to­mor­row Sin­ga­pore time, join­ing two Rus­sians and one Amer­i­can at the ISS, and stay for six months.</p>
    <p>The Crew Dragon this month be­came the first space­craft to be cer­ti­fied by Nasa since the Space Shut­tle nearly 40 years ago.</p>
    <p>The cap­sule is sim­i­lar in shape to the space­craft which pre­ceded Space Shut­tle, and its launch ve­hi­cle is a re­us­able SpaceX Fal­con 9 rocket. At the end of its mis­sions, the Crew Dragon de­ploys para­chutes and then splashes down in wa­ter, just as in the Apollo era.</p>
    <p>Nasa turned to SpaceX and Boe­ing after shut­ting the check­ered Space Shut­tle pro­gramme in 2011, which failed in its main ob­jec­tives of mak­ing space travel af­ford­able and safe.</p>
    <p>The agency would have spent more than US$8 bil­lion (S$11 bil­lion) on the com­mer­cial crew pro­gramme by 2024, with the hope that the pri­vate sec­tor can take care of Nasa’s needs in “low Earth or­bit” so it is freed up to fo­cus on re­turn mis­sions to the Moon and then on to Mars.</p>
    <p>SpaceX, founded by Mr Elon Musk in 2002, has leapfrogge­d its much older ri­val Boe­ing, whose space pro­gramme has floun­dered after a failed test of its un­crewed Star­liner last year.</p>
    <p>But SpaceX’s suc­cess would not mean the United States will stop hitch­ing rides with Rus­sia al­to­gether, said Mr Bri­den­s­tine.</p>
    <p>“We want to have an ex­change of seats where Amer­i­can as­tro­nauts can fly on Rus­sian Soyuz rock­ets and Rus­sian cos­mo­nauts can fly on com­mer­cial crew ve­hi­cles,” he added, ex­plain­ing that this was a nec­es­sary step in case ei­ther pro­gramme was down for any pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>But space ties be­tween the US and Rus­sia, one of the few bright spots in their bi­lat­eral ties, have frayed in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has said it would not be a part­ner in the Artemis pro­gramme to re­turn to the Moon in 2024, claim­ing that the Nasa-led mis­sion is too US-cen­tric.</p>
    <p>Mr Dmitry Ro­gozin, the head of Rus­sia’s space agency Roscos­mos, has re­peat­edly mocked SpaceX’s tech­nol­ogy, and had an­nounced that Roscos­mos would build rock­ets that sur­pass Mr Musk’s.</p>
    <p>He has told a state news agency that he was unim­pressed with the Crew Dragon’s wa­ter land­ing, call­ing it “rather rough”, and say­ing that his agency was de­vel­op­ing a meth­ane rocket that will be re­us­able 100 times.</p>
