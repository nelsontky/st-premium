    <p>NIAMEY (Niger) At least 70 civil­ians were killed in si­mul­ta­ne­ous at­tacks on two vil­lages by sus­pected Is­lamist mil­i­tants in Niger, near the bor­der zone with Mali, se­cu­rity sources said.</p>
    <p>About 49 vil­lagers were killed and 17 wounded in the vil­lage of Tchom­ban­gou, said one of the se­cu­rity sources, who re­quested anonymity.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond source, a se­nior of­fi­cial in Niger’s In­te­rior Min­istry who also spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity, said around 30 other vil­lagers had been killed in the vil­lage of Zaroum­dar­eye.</p>
    <p>Niger’s gov­ern­ment was not im­me­di­ately avail­able to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The West African na­tion has suf­fered at­tacks by Is­lamist mil­i­tants linked to Al-Qaeda and the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria. At­tacks near the western bor­der with Mali and Burk­ina Faso, and the south­east­ern bor­der with Nige­ria, killed hun­dreds of peo­ple last year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Niger’s rul­ing party can­di­date Mo­hamed Ba­zoum is set to face for­mer pres­i­dent Ma­hamane Ous­mane in a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion run-off next month, ac­cord­ing to pro­vi­sional re­sults of the first round of the con­test an­nounced by the elec­toral com­mis­sion on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ba­zoum led the first round, with 39.33 per cent of the vote, fall­ing short of the 50 per cent needed to win out­right in the first round. Mr Ous­mane re­ceived 17 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond round is ex­pected to be held on Feb 21 af­ter the first round’s re­sults have been val­i­dated by the con­sti­tu­tional court that will hear any ap­peals.</p>
    <p>Niger’s Pres­i­dent Ma­hamadou Is­soufou is step­ping down af­ter two five-year terms, which is ex­pected to lead to Niger’s first trans­fer of power be­tween two demo­crat­i­cally elected pres­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The in­com­ing pres­i­dent will in­herit sev­eral chal­lenges, in­clud­ing ris­ing vi­o­lence from Is­lamist mil­i­tants.</p>
