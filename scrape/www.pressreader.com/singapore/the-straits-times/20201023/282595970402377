    <p>The word of the year must surely be “pivot”. Peo­ple have been do­ing a lot of that this year.</p>
    <p>But I re­alise that how you view that word de­pends greatly on how you see the world. Roll your eyes at the men­tion of it then you’re like me, cyn­i­cal and sus­pi­cious of any­thing re­motely earnest. Em­brace it en­thu­si­as­ti­cally, like you do breath­ing, then, dare I say, you’re earnest.</p>
    <p>Bud­ding cor­po­rate lawyer Liow Xuan Rong, 25, has piv­oted from sell­ing dumplings un­der Dizzy Dumplings to sell­ing boozy ice cream un­der Dizzy Daisy.</p>
    <p>She started the home-based food busi­ness be­cause she wanted to re-imag­ine her favourite cock­tails as boozy desserts.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally, I love a good Old Fash­ioned and I thought it would be re­ally cool to put it into an ice cream, some­thing I en­joy very much as well,” she says.</p>
    <p>A mil­len­nial who loves an Old Fash­ioned? In­trigu­ing. Per­haps youth is not wasted on the young after all.</p>
    <p>Old Fash­ioned with Ca­cao Nibs ($12.50 for 300ml, $20 for 500ml) is made with Glen­fid­dich sin­gle malt in­stead of bour­bon.</p>
    <p>The ca­cao nibs are an in­spired touch – their bit­ter edge re­call the An­gos­tura bit­ters that go into the cock­tail.</p>
    <p>Rose Gin and Yuzu ($12.50 for 300ml, $20 for 500ml), made with Squeal­ing Pig pink gin from New Zealand, is more sunny. The Ja­panese cit­rus flavour shines through brightly.</p>
    <p>What I want from both flavours is more booze. That is tricky, how­ever. Too much and ice cream does not freeze prop­erly or at all.</p>
    <p>I sup­pose mod­er­a­tion is key.</p>
    <p>Are you rolling your eyes or nod­ding?</p>
    <p>WHERE: Dizzy Daisy INFO: To or­der, go to str.sg/J6B4. De­liv­ery is free for or­ders $40 and above. Oth­er­wise, there is a $5 fee</p>
