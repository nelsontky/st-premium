    <p>In­done­sia’s safety agency is set to search the waters to­day for the 62 people aboard a Sri­wi­jaya Air Boe­ing 737 that went miss­ing shortly af­ter take-off from the cap­i­tal Jakarta yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Flight SJ182’s last con­tact was at around 2.40pm Jakarta time, four min­utes into its 90-minute jour­ney to Pon­tianak, cap­i­tal of West Kal­i­man­tan prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Car­ry­ing 12 crew and 50 pas­sen­gers, in­clud­ing seven chil­dren and three in­fants, the air­craft lost more than 3,000m in al­ti­tude in less than a minute, ac­cord­ing to flight­track­ing web­site Fligh­tradar24.</p>
    <p>All on board were In­done­sian na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral wit­nesses liv­ing on an is­land near where the plane dis­ap­peared de­scribed hear­ing ex­plo­sions, while oth­ers be­lieved they had found ob­jects that were from the plane.</p>
    <p>“We heard a big boom around 2pm,” a res­i­dent of Lan­cang is­land, part of the Thou­sand Is­lands dis­trict north of Jakarta, told Jakartabas­ed El­sh­inta ra­dio. “We all first thought it was thun­der be­cause rain was pour­ing.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s search and res­cue agency Basar­nas said at a press brief­ing last night that the fo­cus of this morn­ing’s search is be­tween Laki is­land and Lan­cang is­land, about 11 nau­ti­cal miles from where the plane took off.</p>
    <p>“Our per­son­nel have reached the co­or­di­nates where the plane crashed,” Na­tional Trans­porta­tion Safety Com­mit­tee head So­er­janto Tjahjono said.</p>
    <p>“We will do a sur­vey to de­ter­mine (what) the con­di­tion at the lo­ca­tion is. We will de­ploy... un­der­wa­ter re­cov­ery equip­ment.”</p>
    <p>Basar­nas deputy chief, Ma­jorGen­eral Bam­bang Suyo Aji, said: “Search oper­a­tions will con­tinue 24 hours a day, fo­cus­ing on the area where de­bris prob­a­bly be­long­ing to the plane was found.”</p>
    <p>Basar­nas has not re­ceived a dis­tress sig­nal trans­mit­ted from the plane’s emer­gency lo­ca­tor trans­mit­ter.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­istry spokesman Adita Irawati said the plane had de­vi­ated from its nor­mal course and gone in a north-west di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sec­onds af­ter air traf­fic con­trollers asked the pi­lots about the rea­son for the de­vi­a­tion, the plane dis­ap­peared from the radar.</p>
    <p>Sri­wi­jaya Air chief ex­ec­u­tive Jef­fer­son Ir­win Jauwena told re­porters that the flight was de­layed due to heavy rain. The plane was sup­posed to take off about an hour ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to its reg­is­tra­tion de­tails, the plane is a 26-year-old Boe­ing 737-500 that first flew in 1994.</p>
    <p>It is not the more mod­ern 737 Max, the Boe­ing model that was grounded af­ter two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019, in­clud­ing one off Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Sri­wi­jaya Air, a pri­vate bud­get air­line which flies to In­done­sian des­ti­na­tions and to China, Malaysia and Ti­mor-Leste, was es­tab­lished in 2003.</p>
    <p>Eigh­teen out of 30 Sri­wi­jaya Air planes were grounded by the Trans­port Min­istry in Septem­ber 2019 over air­wor­thi­ness con­cerns.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s avi­a­tion sec­tor has long suf­fered from a patchy air safety record, and its air­lines were once banned from en­ter­ing US and Euro­pean airspace.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, dis­traught rel­a­tives waited in Pon­tianak.</p>
    <p>Mr Ya­man Zai, a fa­ther of three chil­dren who were aboard the plane with their mother, told Reuters that he was at the air­port in Pon­tianak wait­ing for them when he heard the news.</p>
    <p>“I will never meet her again,” he said, hold­ing a photo of his old­est daugh­ter.</p>
