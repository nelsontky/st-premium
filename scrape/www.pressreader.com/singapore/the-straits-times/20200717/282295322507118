    <p>LAUSANNE • Turn­ing the Tokyo 2020 Olympics into a closed-door event is “clearly some­thing we don’t want”, In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) chief Thomas Bach has said.</p>
    <p>Safety re­mains the top con­cern for or­gan­is­ers of the qua­dren­nial Games, which were sched­uled to start next week but have been post­poned un­til July 23-Aug 8 next year ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Doubts re­main over the Games be­ing held un­der the cur­rent cir­cum­stances, let alone fans be­ing per­mit­ted to at­tend.</p>
    <p>Bach has ad­mit­ted “mul­ti­ple sce­nar­ios” are un­der considerat­ion for the resched­uled Olympics, but sig­nalled his re­luc­tance to hold the Games in empty sta­di­ums, now an all too com­mon sight in sport amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Olympic Games be­hind closed doors is clearly some­thing we do not want,” the IOC pres­i­dent told re­porters in a video call.</p>
    <p>“So we are work­ing for a so­lu­tion of the Olympic Games which, on one hand, is safe­guard­ing the health of all the par­tic­i­pants and, on the other hand, is also re­flect­ing the Olympic spirit.</p>
    <p>“For this rea­son, we are work­ing now on mul­ti­ple sce­nar­ios of the or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Games with re­gard to the health sit­u­a­tion of which we do not know how it will be in one year from now.”</p>
    <p>Bach and Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe have both warned that it would be hard to post­pone the Games be­yond next year, rais­ing the night­mare sce­nario of the first Olympics to be can­celled in peace time – they have only ever been scrapped dur­ing the world wars.</p>
    <p>Yet it is a pos­si­bil­ity if a vac­cine or ef­fec­tive treat­ment is not de­vel­oped in time, and coun­tries are un­able to con­tain the pan­demic that con­tin­ues to rage un­abated, killing more than 580,000 peo­ple to date.</p>
    <p>If the IOC is forced to axe the Tokyo Games, that would most likely trig­ger a domino ef­fect, tak­ing out the Bei­jing 2022 Win­ter Olympics as well, ac­cord­ing to long-time IOC mem­ber Dick Pound. The Bei­jing Games are sched­uled for Feb 4-20, just six months af­ter the Tokyo event.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing the po­lit­i­cal side out of it for the mo­ment, say there is a Covid-19 prob­lem in July and Au­gust next year in Tokyo, it is hard to imag­ine there is not go­ing to be a knock-on ef­fect in the same area five months later,” Pound told Reuters in a phone in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The Win­ter Olympics could be fur­ther com­pli­cated by an in­creas­ingly frac­tured re­la­tion­ship be­tween the United States and hosts China, and the Cana­dian is fear­ful “all kinds of crazy things could hap­pen”.</p>
    <p>For now, the IOC will hold its 136th Ses­sion vir­tu­ally to­day, with the agenda solely cen­tred on re­ports and con­cerns about “deal­ing with Tokyo”.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Ja­pan’s cap­i­tal moved its coro­n­avirus alert to red, the high­est level, af­ter a resur­gence of cases.</p>
    <p>It re­ported a sin­gle-day record of 286 in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, bring­ing Ja­pan’s to­tal to around 23,000 cases.</p>
