    <p>The Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore (NGS) has re­sponded to crit­i­cism over a per­ceived lack of Chi­nese-lan­guage in­for­ma­tion in its Ge­or­gette Chen: At Home In The World ex­hi­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>Lianhe Zaobao se­nior cor­re­spon­dent Ng Siang Ping, in an opinion piece pub­lished in the news­pa­per last Wed­nes­day, said that an un­named art col­lec­tor left the ex­hi­bi­tion half­way, fum­ing that there was hardly any Chi­nese text in the show. The col­lec­tor com­plained that even the China-born artist’s Chi­nese name, Zhang Li Ying, was ab­sent and that only Ge­or­gette Chen is used.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng asked why the Chi­nese au­dio nar­ra­tion in the au­dio guide was not in­cluded in the ex­hi­bi­tion’s ex­plana­tory notes. She pointed out that for some vis­i­tors, it is not in­tu­itive to down­load the Gallery Ex­plorer App for the in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The piece drew com­ments from the likes of Mr Chee Hong Tat, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs. The Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC MP said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that a res­i­dent had shown him the ar­ti­cle. While he said English plays an im­por­tant role as Sin­ga­pore’s com­mon lan­guage and that he was sure NGS does not “mean any dis­re­spect”, he also stressed the im­por­tance of mul­ti­lin­gual­ism. He said the in­ci­dent is “a re­minder that our mul­ti­lin­gual so­ci­ety is one of Sin­ga­pore’s strengths, and a foun­da­tion of our di­ver­sity and iden­tity”.</p>
    <p>Dr Eu­gene Tan, di­rec­tor of the gallery, told The Straits Times: “When it comes to the cu­ra­to­rial pre­sen­ta­tion of con­tent, es­pe­cially in mono­graphic ex­hi­bi­tions, the gallery takes guid­ance from the artist’s pre­ferred lan­guage for com­mu­ni­ca­tion in or­der to present his or her thoughts and art works in the best pos­si­ble man­ner.</p>
    <p>“In the case of Ge­or­gette Chen, who was mul­ti­lin­gual, English was the lan­guage she most rou­tinely used. Her per­sonal pa­pers in the col­lec­tion of the gallery’s li­brary and ar­chive, in­clud­ing let­ters and diaries, were pre­dom­i­nantly writ­ten in English. There­fore, the ex­hi­bi­tion is pri­mar­ily pre­sented in English so as to re­main true to the artist’s voice.” He pointed out that the ex­hi­bi­tion in­cludes key archival ma­te­ri­als in other lan­guages, in­clud­ing a Chi­nese es­say writ­ten by Chen ti­tled Some Thoughts On Art.</p>
    <p>The mu­seum has pre­sented bilin­gual ex­hi­bi­tions for other artists who pre­fer to ex­press them­selves in other lan­guages, such as Chi­nese and English for painter Chen Wen Hsi and Malay and English for artist Lat­iff Mo­hidin.</p>
    <p>The Chen ex­hi­bi­tion fea­tures au­dio guides in the four of­fi­cial lan­guages as well as Chi­nese-lan­guage tours by do­cents.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan added: “As the gallery is com­mit­ted to its vi­sion of in­spir­ing an in­clu­sive so­ci­ety, we will con­tinue to re­fine our lan­guage pol­icy to im­prove the ac­ces­si­bil­ity of the art that we show.”</p>
