    <p>Op­er­a­tors of fu­neral par­lours are now ex­pected to ad­here to more strin­gent mea­sures for trans­port­ing the dead, fol­low­ing a mix-up in Jan­uary that re­sulted in a wrong body be­ing cre­mated.</p>
    <p>In new guide­lines re­leased yes­ter­day, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) and the As­so­ci­a­tion of Fu­neral Direc­tors Singapore said ve­hi­cles used to trans­fer the dead must be cleaned and main­tained ap­pro­pri­ately, and op­er­a­tors must en­sure the cof­fin is se­curely fas­tened be­fore the ve­hi­cle moves off. The ve­hi­cle should also be en­closed to pre­serve the dig­nity of the dead per­son.</p>
    <p>The NEA said the new guide­lines are to en­sure that hearse op­er­a­tors and fu­ner­ary per­son­nel “meet high pub­lic health stan­dards, ac­cord dig­nity to the de­ceased and serve the needs of the be­reaved fam­i­lies well”.</p>
    <p>The new guide­lines fol­low those that the NEA and the as­so­ci­a­tion is­sued in June for the han­dling of the dead in fu­neral par­lours.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the fu­neral par­lour guide­lines re­quire op­er­a­tors to have a proper sys­tem to iden­tify a dead per­son. Fu­neral par­lours are also to en­sure that the number of bod­ies in the em­balm­ing room is rea­son­able, with hy­giene pre­cau­tions taken to min­imise the risk of dis­ease trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the NEA barred Har­mony Fu­neral Care from us­ing gov­ern­ment af­ter-death fa­cil­i­ties af­ter it was found to have in­suf­fi­cient mea­sures in place to en­sure the proper han­dling of bod­ies.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was im­pli­cated in a mix-up that re­sulted in the first re­ported case of a wrong body be­ing cre­mated in Singapore.</p>
    <p>The send-off of an 82-year-old man was done ac­cord­ing to Chris­tian tra­di­tions and fu­neral rites, when he was a Taoist. The other body be­longed to a 70-year-old man.</p>
    <p>The bod­ies of both men had been ly­ing in the same room at Cen­tury Prod­ucts, a fu­neral par­lour with em­balm­ing fa­cil­i­ties. The mix-up oc­curred when a Har­mony em­ployee mis­tak­enly col­lected the 82-year-old man’s body, in­stead of that of the 70-year-old man.</p>
    <p>Cen­tury Prod­ucts, which had not kept proper records of the bod­ies re­ceived or re­moved from the premises, is fac­ing a crim­i­nal probe.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment yes­ter­day, the NEA said also that from next Jan­uary, con­trac­tors in­tend­ing to pro­vide ser­vices at their cre­ma­tion, burial and colum­bar­ium fa­cil­i­ties must reg­is­ter with it first. These ser­vices in­clude ex­huma­tion, erec­tion of tomb­stone and niche plaque-re­lated work.</p>
    <p>The NEA said this is to en­hance the trans­parency of the in­dus­try and en­sure the ac­count­abil­ity of con­trac­tors. Reg­is­tra­tion is free and con­trac­tors will need to reg­is­ter ev­ery three years.</p>
    <p>The NEA said it has in­formed con­trac­tors of these re­quire­ments so as to give them suf­fi­cient time to reg­is­ter be­fore the new rule kicks in.</p>
    <p>It added that ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tion will be taken against reg­is­tered con­trac­tors and their em­ploy­ees if they are found to have en­gaged in unau­tho­rised ac­tiv­i­ties. They could be is­sued writ­ten warn­ings and have their reg­is­tra­tion with­drawn, de­pend­ing on the se­ri­ous­ness of the breaches.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on the new guide­lines can be found on the NEA’s web­site.</p>
