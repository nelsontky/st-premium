    <p>Are you a gar­den­ing new­bie los­ing sleep over whether you have a green thumb?</p>
    <p>Fret not. This year’s Com­mu­nity Garden Fes­ti­val by the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) is de­signed to al­lay such fears.</p>
    <p>Held on Oct 24 and 25, the fourth edi­tion of the fes­ti­val is mostly virtual, of­fer­ing more than 30 free on­line pro­grammes chock-full of tips and tricks for kick-start­ing a garden on NParks’ dig­i­tal chan­nels that can be ac­cessed safely from home.</p>
    <p>Top­ics i nclude grow­ing leafy greens in apart­ments to cul­ti­vat­ing or­na­men­tal plants out­doors.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there will also be smal­ls­cale, on-site events held at the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens, Jurong Lake Gar­dens, HortPark, Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park and Sun Plaza Park.</p>
    <p>Th­ese on-site tours – to be con­ducted in line with pre­vail­ing safe man­age­ment prac­tices – shed light on bio­di­ver­sity found i n Sin­ga­pore’s gar­dens and pro­vide a be­hind-the-scenes look at glasshouse­s which cre­ate cool con­di­tions for spe­cial plants.</p>
    <p>The Gar­dens will also host virtual tours of its Or­chid Breed­ing and Mi­cro­prop­a­ga­tion Lab­o­ra­tory, the Sin­ga­pore Her­bar­ium, Li­brary of Botany and Hor­ti­cul­ture, and its Seed Bank.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers have taken care to cu­rate a pro­gramme line-up that caters to many in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>His­tory buffs can take a trip down mem­ory lane to a time more than 160 years ago, when the Gar­dens was first set up, through an on­line tour of its Her­itage Museum.</p>
    <p>Or get your­self back to the present by fol­low­ing NParks’ hor­ti­cul­tur­ists as they con­duct virtual treks of two new themed gar­dens at HortPark – My Back­yard Kitchen and Val­ley of Ed­i­bles.</p>
    <p>My Back­yard Kitchen aims to ex­pand vis­i­tors’ knowl­edge of the var­i­ous uses of com­mon ed­i­bles such as pineap­ple and pas­sion­fruit that can be eas­ily grown.</p>
    <p>Val­ley of Ed­i­bles, on the other hand, show­cases a va­ri­ety of heir­loom ed­i­bles like black sorghum and use­ful sus­tain­able gar­den­ing prac­tices such as ver­mi­com­post­ing that help in boun­ti­ful har­vests.</p>
    <p>Ver­mi­com­post is fer­tiliser pro­duced by the di­ges­tion of or­ganic mat­ter such as food, garden and farm wastes by earth­worms.</p>
    <p>A high­light of this year’s fes­ti­val is four free live-stream ses­sions on so­cial me­dia plat­form Face­book, hosted by gar­den­ers from NParks, al­lot­ment gar­dens and the Com­mu­nity in Bloom (CIB) pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The CIB pro­gramme, which was launched in May 2005, aims to foster a com­mu­nity spirit and bring hous­ing es­tate res­i­dents to­gether to help trans­form Sin­ga­pore into a “City in Na­ture”.</p>
    <p>To­day, CIB has more than 1,500 com­mu­nity gar­dens across Sin­ga­pore with more than 40,000 gar­den­ing en­thu­si­asts.</p>
    <p>The Face­book ses­sions fea­ture NParks’ plant health spe­cial­ists, who will share ba­sic tips on pre­par­ing the best soil mix and plant nutri­tion for plants – a handy re­source for those with­out a clue about how plants grow.</p>
    <p>There is also a “Live Chat with Plant Spe­cial­ists”, in which Face­book view­ers can field ques­tions to ex­perts on a va­ri­ety of is­sues and bag gar­den­ing give­aways via live stream.</p>
    <p>On Oct 24, Dr Wil­son Wong, a reg­u­lar con­trib­u­tor to The Straits Times Life sec­tion’s Root Awak­en­ing se­ries, will be con­duct­ing a we­bi­nar on video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>His topic? How to grow chill­ies and cap­sicums in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Cap­sicums and chill­ies are a main­stay of Asian cui­sine, where they pro­vide a pop of colour and flavour,” says Dr Wong, deputy di­rec­tor of Jurong Lake Gar­dens.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, they are of­ten mis­un­der­stood by gar­den­ers as be­gin­ner­friendly plants. The gar­den­ers ex­pe­ri­ence dis­ap­point­ment as th­ese plants are sus­cep­ti­ble to pests and diseases with­out the right care.</p>
    <p>“This we­bi­nar hopes to pro­vide gar­den­ers with tips to care for th­ese plants us­ing en­vi­ron­men­tally and eco­log­i­cally friendly meth­ods,” says Dr Wong, who is also an ad­junct as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of Food Sci­ence & Tech­nol­ogy at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Later in the af­ter­noon on Oct 24, the Na­tional Or­chid Garden’s as­sis­tant cu­ra­tor Mark Choo and Dr Gil­lian Khew, deputy di­rec­tor of molec­u­lar bi­ol­ogy and mi­cro­prop­a­ga­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens, will host a Zoom ses­sion on den­dro­bi­ums and van­das, two pop­u­lar or­chids in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Th­ese or­chids have been ex­ten­sively hy­bridised and cul­ti­vated all over the world and are known for their vi­brant colours and last­ing blooms.</p>
    <p>Some species are also fra­grant, mak­ing them pop­u­lar choices for the home garden.</p>
    <p>Mr Choo and Dr Khew will share their ex­pe­ri­ences grow­ing th­ese or­chids and give tips on how to make them thrive and flower.</p>
    <p>As at press time, th­ese two Zoom we­bi­nars have been over­sub­scribed, but they will be shown on the NPark­sSG YouTube chan­nel af­ter Oct 24.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to com­mu­nity gar­dener Emily Fong, a re­tiree in her 60s who has been tend­ing to her al­lot­ment plot for the last four years, gar­den­ing new­bies need to fol­low their hearts.</p>
    <p>“Plant some­thing you like,” says Madam Fong, whose plot in HortPark has bumper crops of Thai wa­ter­cress.</p>
    <p>“Gar­den­ing is not so much about the dif­fi­culty of each species, but more about set­ting aside time to cul­ti­vate them. For ex­am­ple, my lady’s fingers grow quickly, but they need to be har­vested quickly too,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Go for hardy plants such as kangkong if you are a begin­ner and study and eval­u­ate the plant’s needs to de­ter­mine the amount of ef­fort and time needed to care for it.</p>
    <p>“You have to make time for gar­den­ing if you want to see your plants grow.”</p>
