    <p>Ger­man-born Martin Sch­weiger’s prac­tice, Sch­weiger & Part­ners, is an in­ter­na­tional firm with a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Un­like other firms that deal in mul­ti­ple ar­eas, the firm of at­tor­neys deals solely with patents and trade­mark law, plac­ing a pre­mium on in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>“We started in Mu­nich in 1996, then set up a for­eign branch in Sin­ga­pore in 2001 and the branch did so well that we shifted our head­quar­ters from Ger­many to Sin­ga­pore in 2005. Ac­tu­ally, I like Sin­ga­pore so much that I gave up my Ger­man cit­i­zen­ship, and am now a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen. Sin­ga­pore is home for me,” said Mr Sch­weiger, 55, the firm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“We are a for­eign firm that does in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty law. Our pa­tent at­tor­neys are all cer­ti­fied in Sin­ga­pore as well as in Ger­many and the Euro­pean Union. In fact, we make much more money by be­ing a spe­cial­ist patents firm in­stead of try­ing to do ev­ery­thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sch­weiger stressed the firm does not see it­self as com­pe­ti­tion for lo­cal law firms as it fo­cuses only in the spe­cialised area of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty (IP).</p>
    <p>“So we sit at a very spe­cific, niche point on the value chain.”</p>
    <p>The firm was also both sup­plier and ser­vice provider for lo­cal law firms, re­fer­ring new busi­ness to them, if its clients needed more than IP ser­vices, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>He added that the firm was also more au­to­mated than many oth­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “A few years back, we de­cided that we had noth­ing to lose. We lever­aged tech­nol­ogy and au­to­mated what­ever we could; we’re data-driven and we have a strong em­pha­sis on per­sonal re­la­tion­ships with clients.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 re­ally was just the fi­nal push – it wasn’t dif­fi­cult for our lawyers to do re­mote work. We have daily on­line meet­ings with both the Sin­ga­pore and Mu­nich teams, and that is usu­ally enough to keep us all on track. In fact, now that the cir­cuit breaker is over, we’re plan­ning to re­duce our of­fice space by 60 per cent.”</p>
