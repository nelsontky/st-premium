    <p>• Paris Saint-Ger­main and Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir played their Cham­pi­ons League Group H game to a con­clu­sion on Wed­nes­day, 24 hours after it had been suspended.</p>
    <p>The game – which restarted where it had stopped the pre­vi­ous day in the 14th minute – was largely aca­demic, as the French tre­ble winners had qual­i­fied for the last 16 after RB Leipzig beat Manchester United the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>But after scor­ing a hat-trick as PSG thrashed the Turk­ish cham­pi­ons 5-1 to fin­ish as Group H winners, Brazil­ian star Ney­mar said the walk­out was about mak­ing a</p>
    <p>MAK­ING A STAND</p>
    <p>stand against racism.</p>
    <p>The clash was aban­doned fol­low­ing a touch­line ar­gu­ment over ac­cu­sa­tions that the Ro­ma­nian fourth of­fi­cial, Se­bas­tian Coltescu, had de­scribed Is­tan­bul’s as­sis­tant coach Pierre Webo as black, or “ne­gru” in Ro­ma­nian.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, in ex­treme cir­cum­stances, these things need to be done to see if the world can change a lit­tle,” said Ney­mar, who to­gether with other play­ers from both sides and the new team of of­fi­cials gath­ered around the cen­tre cir­cle and took a knee be­fore the kick-off – in sup­port of the Black</p>
    <p>Lives Mat­ter move­ment.</p>
    <p>Coltescu and the other Ro­ma­nian match of­fi­cials were re­placed by a new ref­er­ee­ing team headed by Dutch­man Danny Makke­lie.</p>
    <p>Play­ers also sported T-shirts with the slo­gan “No To Racism” while warm­ing up at the Parc des Princes, where large ban­ners in the empty stands car­ried the same mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“What hap­pened was un­ac­cept­able. In the times we live in, we can­not ac­cept dif­fer­ences be­ing made like that about colour or race,” Ney­mar, whose strike part­ner Kylian Mbappe scored the other two goals, told French broad­caster RMC Sport.</p>
    <p>“It has no place in foot­ball, or in life, or in any sport, so our at­ti­tude was per­fect.”</p>
    <p>Debu­tants Basak­se­hir had al­ready been elim­i­nated from the Cham­pi­ons League, but they left their mark on the com­pe­ti­tion with their re­sponse to the treat­ment of Cameroo­nian Webo, who was sent off as he re­acted fu­ri­ously to the al­leged com­ment.</p>
    <p>That red card has been suspended by Uefa pend­ing a probe, with Euro­pean foot­ball’s gov­ern­ing body promis­ing a “thor­ough in­ves­ti­ga­tion”.</p>
    <p>“The fourth of­fi­cial used an un­ac­cept­able word to Pierre Achille Webo. The ref­eree should have dealt with the sit­u­a­tion prop­erly but didn’t. We had to show that we were with Webo,” said Basak­se­hir coach Okan Bu­ruk.</p>
    <p>“Webo was up­set. We all gave him our sup­port, but it’s some­one else who should feel bad and that is the per­son who used the words. He is the guilty one.</p>
    <p>“We have to show that we can all live to­gether. Hu­man­ity is the most im­por­tant thing.”</p>
    <p>Some­times, in ex­treme cir­cum­stances, these things need to be done to see if the world can change a lit­tle.</p>
