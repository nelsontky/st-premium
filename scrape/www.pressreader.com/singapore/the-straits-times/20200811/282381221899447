    <p>Tim­ing is a sport­ing art form and on a quiet Sun­day, Collin Morikawa of­fers us an ex­hi­bi­tion in it. You can hear it in the sound of club sweetly meet­ing ball and you can see it in his poise as he seizes his mo­ment.</p>
    <p>Like No­vak Djokovic rais­ing his level in a piv­otal set, Morikawa finds some­thing ex­tra at pre­cisely the right time at the PGA Cham­pi­onship. Two shots to be ex­act. The first is a del­i­cate 18-yard chip at the 14th, the sec­ond a 293-yard drive of de­fi­ance at the 16th.</p>
    <p>These shots come late in the day, they come from nowhere, they sep­a­rate him from the pack and they win a 23-year-old his first Ma­jor in his sec­ond Ma­jor. Po­etic tim­ing is an un­der­state­ment.</p>
    <p>Morikawa, Paul Casey, Dustin John­son, Scot­tie Sch­ef­fler, Tony Finau, Cameron Champ, Bryson DeCham­beau, Ja­son Day and</p>
    <p>Matthew Wolff chase each other up and down a leader­board on a manic Sun­day. Only Day and John­son have won a Ma­jor be­fore, but the rest know that a sin­gle shot can al­ter a life. These mar­gins are what make for the mad­ness of sport.</p>
    <p>Per­haps only in long-dis­tance run­ning do com­peti­tors stick with each other so long. Early on John­son leads at 10 un­der, with five play­ers on nine un­der. On they go, study­ing putts as se­ri­ously as ar­chae­ol­o­gists ex­am­in­ing re­mains at a dig.</p>
    <p>Champ has a two-me­tre putt for the lead on the sev­enth hole but it won’t fall. Wolff misses con­sec­u­tive two-me­tre putts at the 12th and 13th. His­tory is slid­ing by. Later, even cold beer will not ease the hurt of all the ac­cu­mu­lated “if onlys”.</p>
    <p>When Morikawa birdies the 10th, three peo­ple are in the lead. Him­self, 23; John­son, 36; Casey, 43. Old folk may be root­ing for the English­man whose fore­arms re­sem­ble those of a spinach-swal­low­ing cartoon char­ac­ter. Casey smiles eas­ily, John­son’s face doesn’t twitch.</p>
    <p>Then there are four in the lead. Five. Six. Seven. This is like an Agatha Christie novel with a twist. Not who did it, but who dares to do it? With no fans, it’s a sound­less chase for his­tory, bro­ken by the boom of a DeCham­beau drive.</p>
    <p>Once the Amer­i­can hits an eight iron 192 ridicu­lous yards. He be­lieves in ham­mers, Morikawa in slide rules. On one sleeve of the Asian Amer­i­can’s shirt is writ­ten Zurich and he plays with the cal­cu­la­tion of a Swiss in­surer.</p>
    <p>We’re so in awe of mus­cle that we for­get cham­pi­ons come in mul­ti­ple jacket sizes. Cour­ses are mys­ter­ies which can be solved in many ways. Morikawa is 1.75m, as slim as a lamp post, and if he’s 40th in driv­ing dis­tance then he’s first in driv­ing ac­cu­racy. A watch­ing Stephen Curry, an­other straight shooter, must ap­prove.</p>
    <p>Many are play­ing well – the field scor­ing av­er­age on Sun­day is a record low of 69.25 – and so to win is to play bet­ter than well. It is to not so much take a chance but cre­ate one from noth­ing.</p>
    <p>On the par-four 14th, Morikawa drives 305 yards and has 149 to the hole. Blind­fold easy stuff. But he misses the green, short and right, and his ball lies in a swale. It’s a time when play­ers chunk, choke, mishit, but his chip lands, checks, slows, drops. Birdie. It is nerve dis­guised as magic. He leads by one.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple say Morikawa is a sort of bet­ter-en­gi­neered ver­sion of Wil­liam Tell, but me­chan­ics isn’t enough to win. Pre­ci­sion won’t work without calm, ac­cu­racy is use­less without met­tle. Shots on Sun­day evening go where you want only be­cause you be­lieve they will.</p>
    <p>His drive on the short, par-four 16th lands cor­rectly but bounces perfectly onto the green. Noth­ing is won in sport without luck. The ball rolls to two me­tres and he stays as still as a pray­ing priest and sinks his ea­gle putt. It doesn’t mat­ter how many times you see it, watch­ing a cham­pion emerge from within a con­tender is a breath­tak­ing thing.</p>
    <p>He drops the tro­phy’s lid later and it is a beau­ti­fully clumsy mo­ment from a neat, smiling man. He will need all his bal­ance be­cause al­ready they are herald­ing him as a “me­gas­tar”. In a cau­tious, Covid time there are few hugs and high fives, but then Morikawa knows all about dis­tance. By sep­a­rat­ing him­self from a tal­ented field he’s shown us how far he’s come.</p>
    <p>Once DeCham­beau hits an eight iron 192 ridicu­lous yards. He be­lieves in ham­mers, Morikawa in slide rules. On one sleeve of the Asian Amer­i­can’s shirt is writ­ten Zurich and he plays with the cal­cu­la­tion of a Swiss in­surer.</p>
