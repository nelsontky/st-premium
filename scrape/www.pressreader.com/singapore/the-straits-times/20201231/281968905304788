    <p>BEI­JING • An af­fil­i­ate of China’s state-owned drug­maker Sinopharm yes­ter­day said its Covid-19 vac­cine showed 79.34 per cent ef­fi­cacy and it has re­quested reg­u­la­tory ap­proval of the shot, mov­ing it a step closer to be­com­ing China’s first ap­proved vac­cine for gen­eral public use.</p>
    <p>The ef­fi­cacy rate, based on an in­terim anal­y­sis of Phase 3 clin­i­cal tri­als, is lower than the 86 per cent rate for the same vac­cine announced by the United Arab Emi­rates on Dec 9, based on pre­lim­i­nary data from tri­als there.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said de­tailed results would be re­leased later.</p>
    <p>There have been frag­men­tary re­leases of ef­fi­cacy data for Chi­nese vac­cine mak­ers’ Covid-19 can­di­dates, which are be­ing con­sid­ered by many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries for mass in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts warn that piece­meal data with­out suf­fi­cient de­tail could un­der­mine con­fi­dence in the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Turk­ish re­searchers last week said in­terim results from a Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by China’s Si­no­vac Biotech showed 91.25 per cent ef­fi­cacy, but a con­fus­ing read­out the same day from Brazil said the vac­cine’s ef­fi­cacy was be­tween 50 per cent and 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>While the ef­fi­cacy of the Chi­nade­vel­oped shots trails be­hind the more than 90 per cent suc­cess rate of ri­val vac­cines from Pfiz­erBioNTech and Moderna, it points to progress China has made in the global race to de­velop suc­cess­ful Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>China, whose Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has pledged to make its vac­cines a global public good, has won sev­eral large sup­ply deals with coun­tries in­clud­ing In­done­sia and Brazil – the most pop­u­lous coun­tries in South-east Asia and Latin Amer­ica re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>But none of the Chi­nese drug­mak­ers has yet to re­lease de­tailed ef­fi­cacy data.</p>
    <p>Public health pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Cowl­ing of the Univer­sity of Hong Kong said: “I think it’s very pos­i­tive news. The results for other Covid-19 vac­cines... were also re­leased ini­tially in very short press re­leases, and within a few weeks more de­tails were pro­vided.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts warn, how­ever, that it is still early to con­clude how suc­cess­ful the Sinopharm vac­cine is.</p>
    <p>“Data can only be in­ter­preted when key de­tails, such as the study de­sign, num­ber of par­tic­i­pants, pe­riod of ob­ser­va­tion and num­ber of cases, are de­scribed,” said im­munol­ogy pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Sinopharm vac­cine has been used in China’s emer­gency use pro­gramme to vac­ci­nate hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple since July.</p>
    <p>Its de­vel­oper Bei­jing Bi­o­log­i­cal Prod­ucts In­sti­tute, a unit of Sinopharm sub­sidiary China Na­tional Biotec Group (CNBG), said that it had ap­plied to the Na­tional Med­i­cal Prod­ucts Ad­min­is­tra­tion for con­di­tional ap­proval of the vac­cine. CNBG has an­other vac­cine in late-stage tri­als and both have been ap­proved for emer­gency use in China though stud­ies have not been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal govern­ments across the coun­try have em­barked on an am­bi­tious cam­paign to in­oc­u­late 50 mil­lion peo­ple by mid-Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Rather than pro­vid­ing con­crete late-stage trial data to show the ef­fi­cacy of its vac­cines, Chi­nese of­fi­cials have is­sued broad state­ments as­sur­ing the public that they are safe and ef­fec­tive. By con­trast, the United States and Bri­tain started in­oc­u­la­tions only after re­view­ing and ap­prov­ing such trial data.</p>
    <p>Dr Tao Lina, a vac­cine ex­pert and a for­mer im­mu­nol­o­gist at Shang­hai Cen­tre for Dis­ease Control and Pre­ven­tion, said he knew of sev­eral health­care work­ers who de­clined the shots. “In the minds of doc­tors, they feel that any drug that has not passed Phase 3 tri­als is un­re­li­able.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tao, who re­ceived a Sinopharm vac­cine on Mon­day, said he felt con­fi­dent about the vac­cines but that com­pa­nies could do bet­ter in their mes­sag­ing.</p>
    <p>“If you say that it’s safe, then you should show all kinds of ev­i­dence to show that it’s safe,” he said.</p>
    <p>PRO­VIDE CON­CRETE DATA</p>
    <p>If you say that it’s safe, then you should show all kinds of ev­i­dence to show that it’s safe.</p>
    <p>DR TAO LINA, a vac­cine ex­pert, say­ing he felt con­fi­dent about the vac­cines but that com­pa­nies could do bet­ter in their mes­sag­ing.</p>
