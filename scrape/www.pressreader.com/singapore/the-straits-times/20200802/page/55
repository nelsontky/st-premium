Meet PM Lee’s new Cabinet Singapore is battling a third wave of imported Covid-19 cases, with more than 100 infections confirmed in the past month. Here’s a look at who’s who in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s new Cabinet. str.sg/Jn5g str.sg/singapore-cabinet The last days of the tech emperors? about their lax approach to safety.
The evening network news programmes showed Mr Robert F. Kennedy, a newly elected senator from New York, grilling the leaders of General Motors about the tiny amount the company spent on safety research. Later that year, a young lawyer advising the Senate committee, Mr Ralph Nader, published a blockbuste­r expose of the industry, Unsafe At Any Speed. This combinatio­n of political and media scrutiny led to passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which mandated seat belts and additional car safety features, as well as road improvemen­ts like guardrails and traffic barriers.
Wednesday felt like Big Tech’s Ralph Nader moment: the pointed questionin­g by committee members, notably its Democratic women like Representa­tives Val Demings of Florida, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Lucy McBath of Georgia and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvan­ia; the crescendo of investigat­ive journalism that, in part, led to last week’s hearing by shining a critical light on Big Tech’s practices. And now, this House subcommitt­ee is merely one of several legislativ­e or regulatory bodies considerin­g limits on Big Tech’s power.
There are, of course, many reasons tech regulation may not come to pass. The issues at stake are wickedly complex, and quite different for each of these companies, something chief executives sought to underscore in the hearing.
“It appears to me,” Mr Bezos observed, “that social media is a nuance-destructio­n machine, and I don’t think that’s helpful for a democracy.” (Mr Zuckerberg’s reaction to that statement sadly was not visible to the audience.) Large tech companies also have prepared for the regulatory onslaught by starting some of the most well-funded lobbying operations in Washington. They learnt a lesson from Microsoft, whose presence in the capital before its antitrust case in 1998 consisted of one employee who worked out of the back of his car because he lacked proper office space.
Although the trial didn’t end with Microsoft being ordered to break itself apart, it taught the company that government regulators needed to be taken seriously. And as a result Microsoft tamped down its most aggressive market practices, and escaped much of the years-long policy scrutiny now facing its peers.
Then there is the sticky problem of public opinion. During other seminal moments – carmakers in the 1960s, tobacco in the 1990s – the problems posed by unregulate­d bigness were clear-cut. Cigarettes killed people. Cars were unsafe.
Tech’s consumer dangers are harder to see and acutely feel on an average day: misinforma­tion, an incomplete search result, an unfairly promoted link, privacy erosion, a skewed algorithm.
We may wish we used our smartphone­s less, or worry about what overuse of social media is doing to our communitie­s and brains. But we still routinely check our Facebook pages, buy apps via Apple, and click “buy” on Amazon Prime. Even if, as some representa­tives noted, we do so because we have little alternativ­e.
What happens next will depend on many things, including the November election. But last week marks the end of Washington’s great love affair with tech, one that helped make these companies’ bigness possible in the first place. Margaret O’Mara Last Wednesday, Representa­tive David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommitt­ee, opened a half-virtual hearing on “Online Platforms and Market Power” with a combative opening statement: “Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.”
That set the tone for the hours of sharp questionin­g of four of the wealthiest people on the planet: Mr Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mr Tim Cook of Apple, Mr Sundar Pichai of Google and Mr Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, whose companies have a combined market value roughly equivalent to the GDP of Japan.
Given the history of Silicon Valley’s relationsh­ip with Washington, the intensity and precision of some subcommitt­ee members’ questions were remarkable. It is a sign that significan­t tech regulation may be closer than we think.
Despite its techno-libertaria­n image, the tech industry has had close political ties for decades and remarkable success in getting what it wants. In the late 1970s, venture capitalist­s and semiconduc­tor chief executives got Capitol Hill and the Carter White House to agree to tax cuts and looser financial regulation­s. In the 1980s, a group of young legislator­s became such boosters of the industry that they were known as “Atari Democrats”. President Ronald Reagan extolled Silicon Valley entreprene­urship and helped tech companies fend off Japanese competitio­n.
The bipartisan love affair intensifie­d in the 1990s as president Bill Clinton and vice-president Al Gore invited tech executives to shape early Internet-era policymaki­ng. Mr Newt Gingrich, then the Republican Speaker of the House, talked up cyberspace and formed close alliances with libertaria­n-minded tech thinkers.
The lightly regulated online economy we have today is a product of that decade, when Silicon Valley leaders persuaded starry-eyed lawmakers that young, scrappy Internet companies could regulate themselves.
Washington’s embrace of tech continued even as questions emerged about the industry’s wealth and power. A 2013 Senate hearing to interrogat­e Mr Cook about Apple’s tax avoidance quickly was sidetracke­d by lawmakers gushing to the chief executive about his company’s innovative products. Mr Pichai faced tough questions at a 2018 House Judiciary hearing, but also was showered with praise. “Google is still the story of the American dream,” declared Representa­tive Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the committee’s chairman at the time.
Those days seemed a dim memory last Wednesday. Instead, the mood recalled the traffic safety debates of the mid-1960s that helped catalyse significan­tly more regulation for the auto industry. After a steady drumbeat of studies and some short-lived congressio­nal inquiries, traffic safety exploded into the public consciousn­ess starting with Senate hearings in the summer of 1965, where top auto executives faced sharp questions NYTIMES PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
