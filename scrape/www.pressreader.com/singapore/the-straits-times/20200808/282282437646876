    <p>The Sin­ga­pore dol­lar has ral­lied by some 6 per cent against the US cur­rency since March and an­a­lysts see more strength­en­ing ahead.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this is un­likely to have a sig­nif­i­cant bear­ing on the tradeweigh­ted value of the cur­rency tar­geted by the Repub­lic’s cen­tral bank to achieve its mon­e­tary pol­icy goal of price sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Trade-weighted sta­bil­ity means the lo­cal dol­lar has moved in line with other ma­jor trad­ing part­ners’ cur­ren­cies – euro, Ja­panese yen, Chi­nese yuan, Malaysian ring­git – and thus has lit­tle im­pact on its ex­port com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore dol­lar was trad­ing at around 1.3710 ver­sus the US dol­lar at the time of writ­ing. The cur­rency has come a long way from the 11-year low of 1.4610 on March 23 – the peak of the global fi­nan­cial mar­ket panic in­duced by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On March 30, the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) slightly re­duced the rate of ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the trade-weighted, or S$NEER, pol­icy band. The cen­tral bank said it will adopt a zero per cent per an­num rate of ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the pol­icy band start­ing at the pre­vail­ing level of the S$NEER.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim Moh Siong, cur­rency strate­gist at the Bank of Sin­ga­pore, said the pol­icy move by MAS was aimed at sta­bil­is­ing fi­nan­cial con­di­tions by en­sur­ing a sta­ble tradeweigh­ted ex­change rate.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial con­di­tions have sta­bilised, in­ter­est rates are low from where they were ear­lier this year, even the stock mar­ket has re­cov­ered. I would call it a de­sir­able out­come,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Eugene Leow, in­ter­est rate strate­gist at DBS, said flush global liq­uid­ity con­di­tions due to accommodat­ive cen­tral bank poli­cies across the globe are forc­ing in­vestors to seek yield.</p>
    <p>“Some of those monies are find­ing their way into Sin­ga­pore, help­ing to nudge down Sin­ga­pore dol­lar in­ter­est rates in the process. Our Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ment se­cu­ri­ties are still rel­a­tively at­trac­tive com­pared to US Trea­suries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim ex­pects the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar to con­tinue on the path of ap­pre­ci­a­tion on a nom­i­nal ba­sis, re­flect­ing the strength of cur­ren­cies in its trade-weighted bas­ket against the US dol­lar.</p>
    <p>His forecast is that the lo­cal dol­lar would reach S$1.32 i n 12 months, in line with the euro’s rise to US$1.25 from around US$1.19 now. “Given the trade-weighted sta­bil­ity of the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar, we don’t ex­pect any fire­works at the MAS’ Oc­to­ber pol­icy meet­ing, i.e. MAS will main­tain the cur­rent pol­icy stance,” he added.</p>
    <p>The green­back will con­tinue to weaken for the next sev­eral years – a pol­icy goal of the US Fed­eral Re­serve.</p>
    <p>“The Fed­eral Re­serve wants to keep the in­ter­est rates low to sup­port US eco­nomic re­cov­ery and that means a weaker dol­lar,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the speed of the US dol­lar’s de­cline has raised eye­brows.</p>
    <p>A resur­gence of Covid-19 in­fec­tion rates in the US, com­bined with the Euro­pean Union’s un­prece­dented US$2 tril­lion aid and bud­get deal last month, tipped the odds in favour of the euro.</p>
    <p>Mr Philip Wee, cur­rency strate­gist at DBS, said: “We had pro­filed a weaker US dol­lar for the post-pan­demic re­cov­ery in our cur­rency fore­casts but were sur­prised at how quickly the mar­ket has brought for­ward this ex­pec­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>He ex­pects the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar to be un­der­pinned at around S$1.35, un­less the euro pushes to­wards US$1.25 at a faster-than-ex­pected pace.</p>
    <p>UOB Group’s se­nior FX strate­gist Peter Chia noted that the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar also con­tin­ues to track the Chi­nese yuan’s gains against the US dol­lar amid ex­pec­ta­tions of a firmer eco­nomic re­cov­ery i n China in the sec­ond half of the year.</p>
    <p>“The Sin­ga­pore dol­lar there­fore re­mains vul­ner­a­ble to the volatil­ity that an in­creas­ingly tense USChina re­la­tion­ship would bring. While we ex­pect the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar to strengthen fur­ther, proxy hedg­ing for geopo­lit­i­cal risk may limit its gains,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim Moh Siong, cur­rency strate­gist at the Bank of Sin­ga­pore, said the pol­icy move by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore was aimed at sta­bil­is­ing fi­nan­cial con­di­tions by en­sur­ing a sta­ble trade-weighted ex­change rate.</p>
