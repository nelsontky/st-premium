    <p>In the last three months, a flurry of restau­rants have re­opened af­ter clos­ing for an over­haul.</p>
    <p>For many, it was pure co­in­ci­dence that their ren­o­va­tions took place dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April to June, when din­ing-in was banned.</p>
    <p>But Long Beach Seafood Restau­rant said it took ad­van­tage of the slow busi­ness in the mid­dle of last year to re­ju­ve­nate its out­lets.</p>
    <p>Its Dempsey branch was closed for a com­plete makeover for three months, but re­opened in Novem­ber af­ter par­tial ren­o­va­tions.</p>
    <p>An al­fresco area will be added at a new pav­il­ion that is be­ing built next to the ex­ist­ing build­ing, in re­sponse to greater de­mand for outdoor din­ing be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Long Beach also made mi­nor up­grades to three other restau­rants at East Coast Seafood Cen­tre, Sta­dium Boule­vard and IMM in Jurong. They in­clude adding par­ti­tions be­tween ta­bles for more pri­vacy and safer distancing. A fourth out­let at Robert­son Quay opened in Au­gust af­ter the Stevens Road branch closed.</p>
    <p>Over at Ion Or­chard, Chi­nese restau­rant Taste Par­adise said it had planned its ren­o­va­tion and con­firmed the new de­sign months be­fore work started in July, which was when it re­newed its lease.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, such as Kitchen Ta­ble at W Singapore – Sen­tosa Cove, Min Jiang at Good­wood Park Ho­tel, Si Chuan Dou Hua @ Kitch­ener and Peach Blos­soms at Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Ma­rina Bay, made their plans as far back as one to two years ago.</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 trig­gered some ad­just­ments. For ex­am­ple, seat­ing ar­range­ments had to be re­con­fig­ured to meet the 1m safe distancing rule be­tween ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Parkroyal Col­lec­tion Ma­rina Bay and Parkroyal Beach Road, which re­launched their buf­fet eater­ies un­der new names – Pep­per­mint and Ginger re­spec­tively – also changed their con­cept to a la carte buf­fets. The dis­play coun­ters and live sta­tions are now used by chefs as plat­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>There ap­pears to be a com­mon de­sign brief among the re­freshed restau­rants: Make the space lighter and brighter.</p>
    <p>Win­dows that were pre­vi­ously hid­den have been re­vealed to let in light, high ceil­ings ex­posed and dark hues re­placed with sooth­ing ones for a more vi­brant and cheer­ful vibe.</p>
    <p>Most wel­come af­ter a year of doom and gloom.</p>
