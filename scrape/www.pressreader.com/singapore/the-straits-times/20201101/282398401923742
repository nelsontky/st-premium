    <p>Writ­ing about post­par­tum de­pres­sion did not pre­pare Avni Doshi, 37, for ac­tu­ally ex­pe­ri­enc­ing it.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know I had post­par­tum de­pres­sion,” says the mother of a son, two, and a new­born daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“Even though peo­ple had spo­ken to me about it, I wasn’t able to recog­nise the var­i­ous symp­toms in my­self. I just thought I was tired or a lit­tle stressed out. I couldn’t re­ally see the depth of the de­s­pair I had fallen into.”</p>
    <p>Doshi was born in New Jer­sey to par­ents from In­dia and pre­vi­ously worked as an art cu­ra­tor in Mumbai. She be­gan her de­but novel Burnt Sugar eight years ago, mov­ing in the mean­time to Dubai, her hus­band’s home town.</p>
    <p>She never thought it would get pub­lished, let alone make the Booker short­list. When her ed­i­tor called with the news, she was con­vinced she was hal­lu­ci­nat­ing. She sat there in quiet dis­be­lief un­til she re­ceived an e-mail con­fir­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In Burnt Sugar, set in Pune, In­dia, the nar­ra­tor An­tara ex­pe­ri­ences post­par­tum de­pres­sion af­ter the birth of her daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>An­tara, an artist, is also strug­gling to care for her mother Tara, who has de­men­tia. An­tara feels her mother ne­glected her as a child, run­ning away from her mar­riage to an ashram.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship be­tween mother and daugh­ter in the novel is so toxic that it up­set Doshi’s mother be­fore she had even read it.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple must have told her that it’s quite in­tense and dif­fi­cult,” she says over Skype from Dubai. “So she said, ‘You’ve ex­posed me, you don’t have a right to do that, how can you write about things that are pri­vate?’</p>
    <p>“Then she read the book and re­alised it was noth­ing like us, so that calmed her down a lit­tle bit.”</p>
    <p>Doshi has a “rel­a­tively good” re­la­tion­ship with her mother, whom she says is “very proper” and not in the least like the re­bel­lious Tara.</p>
    <p>Still, much of her novel is drawn from re­al­ity. Many rel­a­tives from her mother’s side be­longed to the Osho ashram in Pune, founded by the con­tro­ver­sial guru Bhag­wan Shree Ra­jneesh.</p>
    <p>Doshi’s grand­mother in Pune was di­ag­nosed five years ago with Alzheimer’s dis­ease. Doshi be­came ob­sessed with re­search­ing the con­di­tion. She read sci­en­tific jour­nals, lis­tened to pod­casts and talked to doc­tors about it.</p>
    <p>“I thought, I’m go­ing to cure my grand­mother,” she says. “I have no back­ground in sci­ence, so ob­vi­ously that wasn’t a pos­si­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Just as An­tara uses her art­work to com­pre­hend her mother’s con­di­tion, so Doshi used her novel to try to un­der­stand what was hap­pen­ing to her grand­mother.</p>
    <p>Be­com­ing a mother i n the process of writ­ing her novel has shifted her per­spec­tive on moth­er­hood, she says.</p>
    <p>“I think now that I’m a mother, I re­alise how im­por­tant it is to be able to de­cide that you don’t want to be a mother. The more I un­der­stand about moth­er­hood, the more I re­alise it’s not the best choice for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>“I can un­der­stand how hav­ing, for gen­er­a­tions, that kind of pres­sure where moth­er­hood is a de­ci­sion that’s made for you au­to­mat­i­cally, can be ex­tremely dif­fi­cult and dam­ag­ing for fam­i­lies.”</p>
