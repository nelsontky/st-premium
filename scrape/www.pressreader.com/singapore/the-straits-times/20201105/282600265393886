    <p>SALZBURG • Jerome Boateng hailed Bay­ern Mu­nich’s re­lent­less­ness after his first Euro­pean goal for five years helped ex­tend the team’s record run to 14 straight Cham­pi­ons League wins with a come­back 6-2 thrash­ing of Salzburg on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>With the scores locked at 2-2, he pow­ered home a Joshua Kim­mich cor­ner 11 min­utes from time to re­store the hold­ers’ lead.</p>
    <p>Leroy Sane, Robert Le­wandowski and Lu­cas Her­nan­dez added late goals to give Group A lead­ers Bay­ern a third suc­ces­sive win in this sea­son’s com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-placed Atletico Madrid, who drew 1-1 away at Loko­mo­tiv Moscow, have four points, two more than their Rus­sian op­po­nents, while Salzburg are on one point.</p>
    <p>“It was a dif­fi­cult game as ex­pected, Salzburg played very well,” Boateng told Sky. “We had good and bad phases, es­pe­cially in the sec­ond half, but in the end we got the win we de­served. We never give up – that’s what sets us apart.”</p>
    <p>Sane also ad­mit­ted “we had a harder time than the re­sult sug­gests” ahead of Satur­day’s top-ofthe-ta­ble Bun­desliga clash at Borus­sia Dort­mund.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Boateng said the Bay­ern players are be­hind David Alaba amid his con­tract ex­ten­sion stale­mate. On Mon­day, the Aus­trian de­fender said he was “hurt and dis­ap­pointed” to learn through the press that Bay­ern had with­drawn their lat­est of­fer to ex­tend his deal, which ex­pires next June, after pro­tracted wran­glings.</p>
    <p>“Of course it’s an is­sue, but he is fo­cused on the essen­tials,” Boateng, who part­nered Alaba at cen­tre­back on Tues­day, told Sky.</p>
    <p>“He put in another great game to­day and we’re be­hind him.”</p>
    <p>Alaba has been linked to Manch­ester United and Manch­ester City.</p>
