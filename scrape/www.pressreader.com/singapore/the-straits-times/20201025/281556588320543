    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia yes­ter­day logged 1,228 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, a record high.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous record high of 871 cases was re­ported last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s fig­ure meant that Malaysia has recorded at least 700 cases daily for eight days in a row, com­pared with mostly be­low 200 a day dur­ing the first nine months from Jan­uary, when Covid-19 in­fec­tions be­gan to be tracked closely in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said on Twit­ter that 889 of the 1,228 cases, or 72.3 per cent, were from Sabah.</p>
    <p>The East Malaysian state is the epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s coro­n­avirus pandemic i n the past few weeks, with health of­fi­cials con­duct­ing more tests on the pop­u­la­tion that ex­posed the higher num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>Malaysia from late last month started see­ing an ex­po­nen­tial surge in cases, which has been mostly blamed on the two weeks of cam­paign­ing ahead of the Sept 26 Sabah state polls.</p>
    <p>Some of the thou­sands of cam­paign­ers from all over the coun­try brought the disease with them when they re­turned to their home towns.</p>
    <p>There were out­breaks of Covid-19 cases in Sabah de­ten­tion cen­tres for il­le­gal mi­grants around the same time as the elec­tion cam­paign­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day also re­ported seven new fa­tal­i­ties, bring­ing the death toll to 221.</p>
