    <p>Tick­ets for flights from Sin­ga­pore to Hong Kong were snapped up a day af­ter the an­nounce­ment that quar­an­tine-free leisure travel be­tween the two cities will start on Nov 22.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets for one-way di­rect flights from Sin­ga­pore to Hong Kong by Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways, from Nov 22 to the end of the month, were sold out by 5.30pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At 4.30pm, just an hour be­fore tick­ets were sold out, Google Flights data showed that an SIA econ­omy class book­ing on Nov 30 cost $994.</p>
    <p>One-way di­rect flights f rom Hong Kong to Sin­ga­pore were also sold out at 8pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the “pos­i­tive re­sponse” since the an­nounce­ment, Cathay Pa­cific told The Straits Times that seats on the Hong Kong-to-Sin­ga­pore flight on Nov 22 sold out within 24 hours af­ter they were made avail­able.</p>
    <p>SIA said it has seen an in­crease in book­ings since the an­nounce­ment, but de­clined to re­veal fig­ures due to com­mer­cial sen­si­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Both air­lines are cur­rently the only ones al­lowed to op­er­ate flights un­der the air travel bub­ble ar­range­ment an­nounced on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>As at last night, one-way econ­omy class tick­ets from Sin­ga­pore to Hong Kong de­part­ing next month cost be­tween $397 and $586 for SIA flights.</p>
    <p>For the same route, Cathay Pa­cific’s econ­omy class tick­ets ranged from $347 to $648.</p>
    <p>The air travel bub­ble pro­vides for one flight a day into each city, with 200 pas­sen­gers al­lowed per flight.</p>
    <p>From Dec 7, this will be dou­bled to two flights a day into each city.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said trav­ellers on these flights will have to take Covid-19 tests in lieu of quar­an­tine or stay­home no­tices.</p>
    <p>Travel ser­vices provider Trip.com yes­ter­day said searches on its book</p>
    <p>ing plat­form for flights from Sin­ga­pore to Hong Kong jumped by 200 per cent just three hours af­ter the an­nounce­ment. Searches for flights from Hong Kong to Sin­ga­pore grew by 300 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, searches on travel book­ing plat­form Ex­pe­dia for</p>
    <p>travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong more than tripled af­ter the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel searches rose as well. Trip.com said the most sought-af­ter ho­tels in Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong were lux­ury and high-end ones, es­pe­cially those of­fer­ing dis</p>
    <p>counts and flex­i­ble reser­va­tion poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Tour agen­cies like Dy­nasty Travel said the high de­mand for flights might be due to trav­ellers want­ing to visit their friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“For these trav­ellers, price may not be a con­cern be­cause they can</p>
    <p>fi­nally see their loved ones with­out go­ing through a quar­an­tine,” said Ms Ali­cia Seah, direc­tor of public re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Dy­nasty Travel.</p>
    <p>Mr Aaron Wong, 32, man­aged to book a seat on the in­au­gu­ral flight to Hong Kong on Nov 22.</p>
    <p>“If you want to travel for leisure, the only way is to go via the air bub­ble, if you want to avoid be­ing quar­an­tined for weeks,” said the founder of travel hacks site The Mile­lion.</p>
