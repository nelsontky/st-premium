    <p>Dr Kevin Koo’s jour­ney, like those of many spe­cial­ist med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers, has been a long one.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the 41-year-old grad­u­ated in 2003, he started work in the public health sec­tor, em­bark­ing on a sixyear spe­cial­ist train­ing pro­gramme and earn­ing full ac­cred­i­ta­tion as an or­thopaedic sur­geon in 2014.</p>
    <p>He was prac­tis­ing at the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal (SGH) be­fore set­ting up his own prac­tice in July this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Koo says he per­forms sur­gi­cal op­er­a­tions at dif­fer­ent hos­pi­tals and still serves as a vis­it­ing con­sul­tant at SGH and often at­tends re­search meet­ings there.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­ny­ing Dr Koo on part of this jour­ney is his 2015 BMW 420i Gran Coupe, which has clocked more than 36,000km in three years.</p>
    <p>He bought the se­cond­hand car in 2017 for around $160,000 – a new one would have cost more than $200,000. He drove a Toy­ota Vios and a Mazda 3 pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>“The BMW is my first pre­mium ride. I’m not what you might call a car guy, but I was drawn to the BMW’s sleek sil­hou­ette,” he says.</p>
    <p>He en­joys oc­ca­sional drives along the East Coast Park­way, which he de­scribes as “smooth and en­joy­able”.</p>
    <p>The 420i is a more stylish vari­ant of the me­chan­i­cally sim­i­lar 3-se­ries sedan. For the same price, Dr Koo could have bought a more pow­er­ful BMW 328i, but he says with a shrug: “Aes­thet­ics mat­ter to me and I just like this car’s look.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “Be­sides, it was a twoyear-old car that was avail­able and it had al­ready suf­fered the big ini­tial de­pre­ci­a­tion. I think it looks more youth­ful than a sedan, yet not too flashy.”</p>
    <p>In the months prior to start­ing his own prac­tice, Dr Koo con­tributed to the public health sys­tem’s Covid-19 ef­forts.</p>
    <p>He says the load on or­thopaedics de­creased sig­nif­i­cantly as many non-ur­gent sur­gi­cal op­er­a­tions were post­poned.</p>
    <p>“Hence, I joined my col­leagues to run a makeshift med­i­cal cen­tre at one of the S11 dor­mi­to­ries (that house for­eign work­ers). I also spent a week serv­ing in the fever area of SGH’s Ac­ci­dent and Emer­gency de­part­ment.”</p>
    <p>Dr Koo is mar­ried with three chil­dren – two girls aged nine and two, and a six-year-old boy. His wife, 40, is a home­maker.</p>
    <p>“When we go out as a fam­ily, we use my wife’s seven-seater Toy­ota Wish, but the BMW also sees reg­u­lar fam­ily duty,” he says.</p>
    <p>He uses it to ferry the chil­dren to and from school, tu­ition classes and ten­nis lessons.</p>
    <p>“They love the sun­roof,” he says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>The 420i Gran Coupe is also the ride of choice for date nights.</p>
    <p>“My wife and I make it a point to go out for din­ner – just the two of us – at least once a week,” he adds.</p>
