    <p>Tents erected in a school gym in the South Korean city of Anseong pro­vided shel­ter for some fam­i­lies among more than 1,000 peo­ple made home­less by land­slides and floods. As a pre­cau­tion against the shel­ters be­com­ing Covid-19 hot spots, of­fi­cials at the school erected tents and placed them slightly apart to en­cour­age so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>ANSEONG (South Korea) • Tents erected in a school gym in the South Korean city of Anseong pro­vided shel­ter for some fam­i­lies among more than 1,000 peo­ple made home­less by land­slides and floods caused by the coun­try’s long­est pe­riod of rain in seven years.</p>
    <p>At l east 15 peo­ple have been killed and more than 1,500 forced from their homes dur­ing 43 con­sec­u­tive days of rain, though a few hun­dred have man­aged to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting at the Anseong shel­ter, which housed 33 peo­ple as of yes­ter­day, 83-year-old Kwon Cha­soon’s eyes were filled with tears as she re­counted los­ing ev­ery­thing to a land­slide. “There isn’t a sin­gle plate... It’s an empty house,” she said. “All my pots and gar­lic jars have been swept away.”</p>
    <p>More than 1,146 peo­ple re­mained in tem­po­rary shel­ters set up in gyms and com­mu­nity cen­tres as of yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of the In­te­rior and Safety said, with mea­sures im­ple­mented at the fa­cil­i­ties to pre­vent the spread of the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion against the shel­ters be­com­ing Covid-19 hot spots, of­fi­cials at the school in Anseong, a city of 190,000 peo­ple 80km south of Seoul, erected tents and placed them slightly apart to en­cour­age so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­lief work­ers checked peo­ple’s tem­per­a­tures and screened for any Covid-19 symp­toms. Dis­placed res­i­dents were asked to wear masks and wash their hands.</p>
    <p>“I was a bit con­cerned about the coron­avirus, but there is no al­ter­na­tive given the si­t­u­a­tion,” said Mr Kim Soo-goon, whose home was filled with de­bris and mud fol­low­ing a land­slide.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun called for the Health Min­istry to de­clare three prov­inces in the north­ern part of the coun­try as spe­cial dis­as­ter zones, which would en­ti­tle them to re­ceive ad­di­tional aid.</p>
    <p>In North Korea, state me­dia warned of “torrential” rain, pos­si­ble flood­ing, and high winds and waves.</p>
    <p>While the re­ports did not men­tion any spe­cific dam­age, this year’s heavy rain comes dur­ing the sum­mer har­vest sea­son, rais­ing con­cerns about food se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The rain ap­pears to be hit­ting some of the ma­jor rice-grow­ing ar­eas of North Korea, said Dr Choi Yong-ho, re­search fel­low at the Korea Ru­ral Eco­nomic In­sti­tute in Seoul.</p>
    <p>“This flood­ing will have a neg­a­tive im­pact on North Korea’s food sup­ply,” he said.</p>
