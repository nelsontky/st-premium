    <p>The direc­tor of a frozen meat im­porter was among four in­di­vid­u­als re­manded for four days in Jo­hor in con­nec­tion with a meat car­tel scan­dal which is also be­ing probed for cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion (MACC) direc­tor Azmi Alias said the three oth­ers in re­mand are the com­pany’s oper­a­tion direc­tor and one of its clerks, as well as the direc­tor of a whole­sale com­pany.</p>
    <p>He said that the MACC is in­ves­ti­gat­ing the case un­der Sec­tion 17(b) of the MACC 2009 Act, which car­ries a fine of five times the amount of t h e b r i b e o r R M1 0 , 0 0 0 (S$3,269) whichever is higher, and im­pris­on­ment of not more than 20 years upon con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant regis­trar Nur Iz­zaty</p>
    <p>Muham­mad Za­hari al­lowed the four sus­pects, aged be­tween 39 and 50, in­clud­ing one woman, to be re­manded start­ing from yes­ter­day to fa­cil­i­tate MACC’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>News emerged early last month that the au­thor­i­ties had busted a syn­di­cate that had been smug­gling meat prod­ucts from Ukraine, Brazil, Ar­gentina and China, and repack­ag­ing them with ha­lal lo­gos.</p>
    <p>A raid was car­ried out at a ware­house in Se­nai, Jo­hor, where 1,500 tonnes of frozen meat worth RM30 mil­lion were seized.</p>
    <p>The syn­di­cate, be­lieved to have been op­er­at­ing for years, had al­legedly been us­ing the ware­house to make fake la­bels and stamps to be pasted on pack­ages of meat not cer­ti­fied to be ha­lal.</p>
    <p>MACC deputy chief com­mis­sioner (op­er­a­tions) Ah­mad Khu­sairi Ya­haya said the com­mis­sion has con­ducted a se­ries of raids over the past two weeks in its in­ves­ti­ga­tion, and im­port doc­u­ments dat­ing back to 2015 were seized dur­ing the raids.</p>
    <p>“In­ves­ti­ga­tors are go­ing through the doc­u­ments and the com­pa­nies’ ac­counts to trace their ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We are in the process of de­ter­min­ing the mas­ter­mind be­hind the meat car­tel and if they had re­ceived pro­tec­tion from any en­force­ment of­fi­cers,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion will be on two as­pects, in­clud­ing the of­fence of sub­mit­ting false dec­la­ra­tions in Cus­toms Form 1 by the im­port­ing com­pa­nies and agents han­dling the im­por­ta­tion process.</p>
    <p>Sources said the sec­ond fo­cus is on whether the com­pa­nies had paid any cor­rup­tion money via their ac­counts.</p>
