    <p>If you have ever won­dered why you feel down all the time, why you have in­di­ges­tion or why you have a foggy brain, the prob­lem might be with your gut.</p>
    <p>AMiLi or the Asian Mi­cro­biome Li­brary, a Sin­ga­pore start-up, has been work­ing to map the gut mi­cro­biome of peo­ple liv­ing here, by ap­peal­ing to them to do­nate their poop for re­search.</p>
    <p>Now, it is of­fer­ing a ser­vice where mem­bers of the pub­lic can have their gut mi­cro­biome an­a­lysed, us­ing a scoop of poop.</p>
    <p>A di­eti­tian will then give them ad­vice on what life­style changes they can make to im­prove their mood, think more clearly, have bet­ter heart and liver health, and im­prove their di­ges­tive well­ness, among other things.</p>
    <p>There has been a lot of buzz in the last few years about the hu­man gut mi­cro­biome. The gut mi­cro­biome is the ge­netic ma­te­rial of the tril­lions of mi­crobes in the hu­man body. With ad­vances in science, re­searchers and sci­en­tists can look at how th­ese mi­cro-or­gan­isms in the gut are linked to disease.</p>
    <p>Dys­func­tion in the mi­cro­biome has been as­so­ci­ated with au­toim­mune diseases such as di­a­betes, rheuma­toid arthri­tis, mus­cu­lar dys­tro­phy and mul­ti­ple scle­ro­sis; gas­troin­testi­nal prob­lems such as Crohn’s disease and ir­ri­ta­ble bowel syn­drome; and other con­di­tions such as eczema, anx­i­ety, obe­sity and autism.</p>
    <p>Re­search i n Asia has l agged behind the West, and a group of doc­tors and re­searchers here started AMiLi last De­cem­ber to catch up and to give their peers data rel­e­vant to peo­ple from this part of the world. The start-up is headed by Dr Jeremy Lim, AMiLi’s co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>It started by ap­peal­ing to Sin­ga­pore­ans and those liv­ing here to con­trib­ute their poop, to add to the data­bank for the li­brary, or, in the case of very healthy peo­ple with “pre­mium” poop, to con­trib­ute sam­ples that can be pro­cessed and used for fe­cal mi­cro­biota trans­plants. In Sin­ga­pore, this pro­ce­dure is used for treat­ing se­vere cases of C. dif­fi­cile in­fec­tion. The bac­te­rial in­fec­tion can re­sult in the per­fo­ra­tion of the colon or sep­sis. The trans­plant in­tro­duces healthy bac­te­ria into the pa­tient’s gut.</p>
    <p>But th­ese trans­plants can be used to treat more than just C. dif­fi­cile in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim says: “We are work­ing with var­i­ous aca­demic in­sti­tu­tions to con­duct re­search into the dif­fer­ent po­ten­tial ap­pli­ca­tions of fe­cal mi­cro­biota trans­plants, such as in­flam­ma­tory bowel disease and ir­ri­ta­ble bowel syn­drome.”</p>
    <p>Early bird sales of the AMiLi Bio+Me Gut Mi­cro­biome Test have started. It costs $129 un­til the end of the year or for the first 1,000 kits. Af­ter that, the price is $229. Peo­ple can or­der the kits from bioandme.asia. There are in­struc­tions on how to ac­ti­vate an ac­count and sub­mit a stool sam­ple to AMiLi to be an­a­lysed.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim says mi­cro­biome se­quenc­ing has been of­fered in the United States and Europe for a num­ber of years and the ref­er­ence data is based in large part on Cau­casian data. “We wanted to of­fer in Sin­ga­pore, and Asia more broadly, a test based on global as well as Asian data with rec­om­men­da­tions tai­lored to the di­ets and life­styles in Asia,” he says.</p>
    <p>In the se­cond quar­ter of next year, AMiLi will roll out a sub­scrip­tion plan for peo­ple who want their gut mi­cro­biome an­a­lysed reg­u­larly. Prices are not avail­able yet.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim says: “The gut mi­cro­biome is highly dy­namic and re­spon­sive to changes in life­style, en­vi­ron­ment and diet. Test­ing one’s mi­cro­biome every three months is a great way to track any changes in the mi­cro­biome, as well as to see the ef­fects of diet and life­style changes peo­ple have made.”</p>
    <p>Ms Bibi Chia, prin­ci­pal di­eti­tian of Raf­fles Hos­pi­tal Sin­ga­pore, is also AMiLi’s nu­tri­tion ad­viser. She and her team will look at the re­sults of the test and give rec­om­men­da­tions on how in­di­vid­u­als can boost the per­for­mance of their gut mi­cro­biome.</p>
    <p>The re­sults will be split into three parts: Think Well, Live Well and Feel Well.</p>
    <p>She says: “Your gut is also as­so­ci­ated with the pro­duc­tion of neu­ro­trans­mit­ters that in­flu­ence your feel­ings, mood and af­fect your brain func­tion. The Think Well cat­e­gory mea­sures the lev­els of cer­tain neu­ro­trans­mit­ter-in­flu­enc­ing mi­crobes that are im­por­tant to your men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“The Live Well cat­e­gory looks at the path­ways that your mi­crobes take to pro­duce chem­i­cals that im­pact your heart, gut and liver health. And the Feel Well cat­e­gory mea­sures your mi­cro­biome’s ef­fi­ciency in break­ing down nu­tri­ents and pro­duc­ing short-chain fatty acids, which are im­por­tant com­pounds that help us pro­duce, store, and use en­ergy.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the Think Well part of the re­port mea­sures the pro­duc­tion lev­els of GABA or gamma</p>
    <p>The gut mi­cro­biome is highly dy­namic and re­spon­sive to changes in life­style, en­vi­ron­ment and diet. Test­ing one’s mi­cro­biome... is a great way to track any changes in the mi­cro­biome, as well as to see the ef­fects of diet and life­style changes peo­ple have made.</p>
    <p>DR JEREMY LIM, AMiLi’s co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive. The com­pany sells test kits for peo­ple to sub­mit their stool sam­ples to be an­a­lysed</p>
    <p>Although there is great in­ter­est in the mi­cro­biome, there is still a long way to go be­fore mi­cro­biome-based di­ag­nos­tics be­come a rou­tine part of clin­i­cal care.</p>
    <p>UNITED STATES-BASED RE­SEARCHERS, in a 2018 pa­per pub­lished in the Clin­i­cal Gas­troen­terol­ogy and Hepa­tol­ogy jour­nal</p>
    <p>Ami­nobu­tyric acid, and sero­tonin. Th­ese are neu­ro­trans­mit­ters which reg­u­late sleep and anx­i­ety. Up to 90 per cent of th­ese neu­ro­trans­mit­ters are made by good gut bac­te­ria such as lac­to­bacil­lus and bi­fi­dobac­terium.</p>
    <p>“Low l evels of th­ese bac­te­ria might cor­re­late to a lower pro­duc­tion of neu­ro­trans­mit­ters and will re­sult in a lower Think Well score,” she says. “The di­etary rec­om­men­da­tions we make in such a sce­nario will fo­cus on boosting the lev­els of GABA- and sero­tonin-pro­duc­ing bac­te­ria.”</p>
    <p>Doc­tors say there are prac­ti­cal rea­sons for know­ing about one’s gut mi­cro­biome.</p>
    <p>Dr Juanda Leo Hartono, con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH), Sin­ga­pore’s Di­vi­sion of Gas­troen­terol­ogy & Hepa­tol­ogy, says: “In the fu­ture, it may be pos­si­ble to use the gut mi­cro­biome as a biomarker, to iden­tify or pre­dict the clin­i­cal course and sever­ity of disease, the re­sponse to a par­tic­u­lar treat­ment, and the com­pli­ca­tions of treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the abil­ity to pre­dict th­ese will al­low a more tai­lored, per­son­alised, form of medicine.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Poh Seng, a gas­troen­terol­o­gist in pri­vate prac­tice, says gut prob­lems such as ir­ri­ta­ble bowel syn­drome, con­sti­pa­tion, acid re­flux and gas­tri­tis are com­mon among Sin­ga­pore­ans, and older peo­ple are more prone to de­vel­op­ing di­ver­tic­u­lar disease, colon polyps and colon can­cer.</p>
    <p>He says: “I am i nter­ested i n of­fer­ing the Bio+Me Gut Mi­cro­biome Test to some of my pa­tients, to bet­ter un­der­stand their gut mi­cro­biome and how I can use this in­for­ma­tion to im­prove their gut con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>But the test is not nec­es­sary for most peo­ple for now.</p>
    <p>As a 2018 pa­per led by United States-based re­searchers in the Clin­i­cal Gas­troen­terol­ogy and Hepa­tol­ogy jour­nal con­cluded: “Although there is great in­ter­est in the mi­cro­biome, there is still a long way to go be­fore mi­cro­biome­based di­ag­nos­tics be­come a rou­tine part of clin­i­cal care.”</p>
    <p>Dr Alex Soh, con­sul­tant at NUH’s Di­vi­sion of Gas­troen­terol­ogy & Hepa­tol­ogy, notes that gut mi­cro­biome test­ing is cur­rently not rou­tinely per­formed in the clin­i­cal set­ting.</p>
    <p>He adds that in the fu­ture, when the link be­tween the gut mi­cro­biome and cer­tain health con­di­tions is more well-es­tab­lished, al­low­ing per­son­alised tar­geted ther­a­peu­tic in­ter­ven­tions to be made avail­able, it will be­come clearer which groups of in­di­vid­u­als would stand to ben­e­fit from hav­ing their gut mi­cro­biome an­a­lysed.</p>
    <p>Still, peo­ple here who have had their poop an­a­lysed by AMiLi say they have a bet­ter idea of their health sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Ed­die Goh, 66, says: “I was a lit­tle scep­ti­cal and cu­ri­ous about what a poop sam­ple can tell about the body’s state of health.”</p>
    <p>He says the re­sults tal­lied with two other med­i­cal stud­ies he took part in. “My fairly good over­all re­sults gave me more mo­ti­va­tion to con­tinue with my present life­style and di­etary habits,” he says.</p>
