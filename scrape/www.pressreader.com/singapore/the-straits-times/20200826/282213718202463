    <p>LON­DON • For­mula One fleshed out this year’s cal­en­dar to 17 races yes­ter­day, with the Chi­nese Grand Prix can­celled due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, but Turkey back on for the first time since 2011 and Bahrain handed two rounds.</p>
    <p>The mo­tor sport said in a state­ment that the Is­tan­bul Park cir­cuit would host a race on Nov 15 be­fore a Bahrain dou­ble-header – one of the races has been named the Sakhir Grand Prix – in late Novem­ber and early De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The sea­son will end in Abu Dhabi on Dec 13 at Yas Ma­rina.</p>
    <p>F1 added a limited num­ber of fans will be able to at­tend some of the later grands prix, with hos­pi­tal­ity to be pro­vided, but gave no fur­ther de­tails, al­though Rus­sian GP or­gan­is­ers are al­ready sell­ing tick­ets for their race in Sochi on Sept 27.</p>
    <p>All six races have so far been held be­hind closed doors due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For­mula One had con­firmed only 13 races un­til yes­ter­day, all of them in Europe af­ter those in the Amer­i­cas and Asia were axed, but teams and driv­ers now have a clear idea of how many the cham­pi­onship will have. A min­i­mum of eight races must be staged for a cham­pi­onship to be valid.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal sched­ule, pub­lished be­fore the pan­demic, en­vis­aged a record 22 grands prix, but fixtures such as Monaco and Sin­ga­pore had to be can­celled, with a new cal­en­dar drawn up fea­tur­ing a mix of old favourites and new venues.</p>
    <p>The Shang­hai race had looked doubt­ful af­ter Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties ear­lier this year banned the host­ing of most ma­jor sport­ing events to fo­cus on bat­tling the virus. The first Viet­namese Grand Prix, post­poned from April, will not be hap­pen­ing ei­ther, with Sky Sports yes­ter­day say­ing it will be called off.</p>
    <p>“Sadly, we will not be racing in</p>
    <p>China this sea­son,” F1 said, adding that it looked for­ward to re­turn­ing next year.</p>
    <p>Is­tan­bul will be the only race this year that could be con­sid­ered a nonEuro­pean or Mid­dle East­ern round, since the cir­cuit is on the Asian side of the city. While pop­u­lar with driv­ers, the lo­cals never had the same af­fec­tion for the Turk­ish Grand Prix due to over­priced tick­ets.</p>
    <p>In 2009, 36,000 three-day tick­ets were sold, de­spite the venue hav­ing a ca­pac­ity for 130,000 peo­ple, lead­ing for­mer Red Bull driver Mark Webber to com­plain that they were “too ex­pen­sive”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, F1 com­men­ta­tor David Croft has backed the de­ci­sion to re­turn to Is­tan­bul, tweet­ing “it was a shame F1 stopped racing there”.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent driv­ers who had won there are Alfa Romeo’s Kimi Raikko­nen, Lewis Hamil­ton of Mer­cedes and Fer­rari’s Se­bas­tian Vet­tel.</p>
    <p>On Is­tan­bul, Re­nault driver Este­ban Ocon, 23, said re­cently: “It’s an old-school cir­cuit, some­thing I watched on TV when I was younger. (That) mas­sive left-han­der, flat-out, is go­ing to be pretty im­pres­sive.”</p>
