    <p>Bryan Cranston is head­lin­ing a tele­vi­sion show for the first time since his run on the crit­i­cally revered Break­ing Bad (2008 to 2013), in which he played schoolteac­her­turned-drug dealer Wal­ter White – a role that won him four act­ing Em­mys.</p>
    <p>In Your Honor, a minis­eries air­ing at 10pm on Mon­days on FX (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 310, StarHub TV Chan­nel 507) and stream­ing on Fox+, he once again plays a man who crosses over to the dark side: a judge, Michael De­si­ato, who de­cides to cover it up when his son ac­ci­den­tally kills a boy in a hit-an­drun.</p>
    <p>The show is adapted from an Is­raeli minis­eries, Kvodo (2017 to now), and co-stars Michael Stuhlbarg as the father of the vic­tim – a pow­er­ful crime boss now bent on find­ing his son’s killer.</p>
    <p>Cranston, 64, thinks the char­ac­ter is unique enough that Break­ing Bad fans will not just see a vari­a­tion on his iconic char­ac­ter from that se­ries.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t think of (Wal­ter White) in mak­ing this. There are sim­i­lar­i­ties, of course – both are men of a cer­tain age and fathers,” he tells the press in a video call.</p>
    <p>“But you have to find the dis­tinc­tion between them,” says the star, who also ap­peared in the pop­u­lar com­edy se­ries Mal­colm In The Mid­dle (2000 to 2006).</p>
    <p>“Wal­ter White was very me­thod­i­cal in his jour­ney and what he was plot­ting to do. Michael De­si­ato in Your Honor is im­pul­sive. He has to make an im­me­di­ate de­ci­sion on what is go­ing to save his son’s life, then has to suf­fer the reper­cus­sions of that de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor says he is drawn to char­ac­ters who go to ex­tremes when their backs are against the wall.</p>
    <p>“Whether we con­sciously know it or not, I think we are all at­tracted to and re­late to char­ac­ters that are flawed.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we are im­per­fect as well. There are strengths and weak­nesses that we have, and I too no­tice and want to see that when I read a char­ac­ter.”</p>
    <p>Any char­ac­ter who is too per­fect puts him to sleep.</p>
    <p>“If I read a char­ac­ter that has all the answers, makes the right de­ci­sions and is kind to ev­ery­one, I’m bored. I don’t want to play that char­ac­ter.”</p>
    <p>And hav­ing a re­al­is­tic, re­lat­able pro­tag­o­nist is es­sen­tial for a suc­cess­ful TV show.</p>
    <p>“That’s what’s nec­es­sary for an au­di­ence to in­vest their time and en­ergy and sym­pa­thies in a char­ac­ter and root for him. So I look for char­ac­ters that are com­plex and con­flicted but in­ter­est­ing.”</p>
    <p>To pre­pare for this part, Cranston camped out at a court­house for two weeks watch­ing real judges in ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“The first thing I did was go to New Or­leans, where the story takes place. They have one court­house with su­pe­rior court judges, and I watched a bunch of tri­als at dif­fer­ent stages, from ar­raign­ment to jury se­lec­tion to the ac­tual tri­als.</p>
    <p>“And I ob­served the judges and their vary­ing per­son­al­i­ties: Some are very much masters of their uni­verse and they take con­trol; oth­ers like to be in the back­ground.”</p>
    <p>Cranston is asked if the de­pic­tion of law en­force­ment and the ju­di­cial sys­tem in the United States on se­ries such as this has changed since the Black Lives Mat­ter protests ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“I hope that it has changed or is chang­ing to re­flect the re­al­ity of the sit­u­a­tion. Peter Mof­fat, our writer, was very cau­tious and very spe­cific about how to de­pict ac­cu­rately what the prison and ju­di­cial sys­tem looks like in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“The prison sys­tem is over­whelm­ingly oc­cu­pied by African Amer­i­cans, so there’s some­thing askew there,” he notes.</p>
    <p>And if shows such as Your Honor do not shy away from that re­al­ity, “per­haps view­ers will get the sense that that is the way it is, or feel the story is au­then­tic”, Cranston sug­gests.</p>
    <p>“And maybe so­cially minded view­ers will go, ‘Maybe some­thing should be done about this.’”</p>
    <p>For the ac­tor, that sort of au­then­tic­ity is now non-ne­go­tiable when he takes on a project.</p>
    <p>“I think any­thing less than an hon­est por­trayal of what’s hap­pen­ing in our jus­tice and ju­di­cial sys­tem is false, and I don’t want to be a char­la­tan in that re­gard. I don’t want to be in­volved in some­thing that doesn’t do it jus­tice.”</p>
    <p>If I read a char­ac­ter that has all the answers, makes the right de­ci­sions and is kind to ev­ery­one, I’m bored. I don’t want to play that char­ac­ter.</p>
