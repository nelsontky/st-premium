    <p>Top Chi­nese diplo­mat Yang Jiechi met Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and other lead­ers yes­ter­day dur­ing a three-day visit to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They dis­cussed top­ics like co­op­er­a­tion be­tween both coun­tries de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and ex­changed views on global and re­gional de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>They also reaf­firmed the im­por­tance of strength­en­ing co­op­er­a­tion in a rules-based in­ter­na­tional or­der, said the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang is a mem­ber of the Polit­buro and heads the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s for­eign af­fairs of­fice.</p>
    <p>Apart from call­ing on PM Lee at the Is­tana, he also met Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in his of­fice and had meals with Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean and For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and China com­mem­o­rate 30 years of diplo­matic re­la­tions this year. DPM Heng and Mr Yang agreed that both sides should work to­gether, and with other coun­tries, to strengthen sup­ply chain and cross­bor­der con­nec­tiv­ity to fa­cil­i­tate eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>They also looked for­ward to the an­nual Joint Coun­cil for Bi­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion, which will take place later this year and is jointly chaired by DPM Heng and Chi­nese Vice-Premier Han Zheng.</p>
    <p>China’s top diplo­mat and Sin­ga­pore lead­ers dis­cussed the wide- rang­ing co­op­er­a­tion be­tween their coun­tries, in­clud­ing moves to com­bat the health and eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19, when they met yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang Jiechi, a mem­ber of China’s Polit­buro and head of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s for­eign af­fairs of­fice, is the first top Chi­nese of­fi­cial to visit Sin­ga­pore since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his three-day visit, he called on PM Lee at the Is­tana and Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in his of­fice.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the on­go­ing pan­demic, it’s a good feel­ing to re­turn to some sem­blance of nor­malcy,” PM Lee said in a Face­book post, adding that he had a fruit­ful meet­ing with Mr</p>
    <p>Yang. Sin­ga­pore and China are com­mem­o­rat­ing 30 years of for­mal ties this year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) said PM Lee and Mr Yang af­firmed the strong ties be­tween their coun­tries.</p>
    <p>They ex­pressed ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the mu­tual sup­port be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China dur­ing the pan­demic, and wel­comed the con­tin­ued good progress in bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion de­spite Covid-19, it added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and China had ear­lier agreed on a “fast lane” for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel be­tween them. It cov­ers six Chi­nese prov­inces and mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties so far.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully this list will grow if the sit­u­a­tion stays un­der con­trol,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate post, DPM Heng wrote that his meet­ing with Mr Yang was his first in-per­son meet­ing with a for­eign leader since the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion es­ca­lated. The two last met in China in May last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China is “deep and mul­ti­fac­eted”.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries have worked closely to com­bat the pub­lic health and eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic, he added.</p>
    <p>They also agreed that both sides should work to­gether – as well as with other coun­tries – to strengthen sup­ply chain and cross­bor­der con­nec­tiv­ity to fa­cil­i­tate eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said the i deas they talked about can be taken up at the Joint Coun­cil for Bi­lat­eral Co­op­er­a­tion, the high­est-level plat­form be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It is chaired by DPM Heng and Chi­nese Vice-Premier Han Zheng, and it is Sin­ga­pore’s turn to host the an­nual meet­ing later this year.</p>
    <p>“As we grad­u­ally re­sume daily ac­tiv­i­ties and re­open our bor­ders, we can look for­ward to more high-level ex­changes, with safe mea­sures in place, as we strengthen our ties with coun­tries around the world,” Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>He added that the pan­demic has high­lighted how in­ter­con­nected the world is. “We must work in close co­op­er­a­tion with all coun­tries to over­come this pan­demic and emerge stronger.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yang was hosted to lunch by Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean, while For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan hosted break­fast.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo said he took a stroll with Mr Yang along the Sin­ga­pore River. They vis­ited the Deng Xiaop­ing com­mem­o­ra­tive marker as well as the Tang Ship­wreck Ex­hi­bi­tion at the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries need to work to­gether more closely to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion in a rules-based in­ter­na­tional or­der, and to se­cure the well-be­ing, safety and pros­per­ity of their peo­ples, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan said in his post that he had a fruit­ful dis­cus­sion with Mr Yang on bi­lat­eral ties, and dis­cussed re­gional and global de­vel­op­ments in a post-coro­n­avirus world.</p>
    <p>They also wit­nessed a cheque pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­mony for a char­ity pro­ject ini­ti­ated by the Sin­ga­porean com­mu­nity in China to help re­duce poverty in Chongqing’s Peng­shui County.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang’s trip to Sin­ga­pore is his first visit to South-east Asia since the pan­demic be­gan. He will travel to Bu­san to­day and hold talks with South Korea’s new na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Suh Hoon to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>BOOST­ING TIES WITH OTHER COUN­TRIES</p>
    <p>As we grad­u­ally re­sume daily ac­tiv­i­ties and re­open our bor­ders, we can look for­ward to more high-level ex­changes, with safe mea­sures in place, as we strengthen our ties with coun­tries around the world. ’’</p>
