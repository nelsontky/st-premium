    <p>A SHARE­HOLDER OF COM­MER­CIAL VE­HI­CLE RENTAL FIRM RHINO RENTAL, ON THE PAN­DEMIC FU­ELLING DE­MAND FOR SUCH VE­HI­CLES</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has fu­elled a de­mand for light com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles, as peo­ple turn to de­liv­ery ser­vices for food and other es­sen­tials.</p>
    <p>Van and lorry rental com­pa­nies are re­port­ing a surge in busi­ness from old as well as new cus­tomers, in­clud­ing those who have lost their jobs amid the eco­nomic fallout from the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Lawrence Mok, head of mar­ket­ing at Pan-Pa­cific Leas­ing Group, one of the big­ger com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle rental firms here, said in­di­vid­u­als make up half of this year’s leases, com­pared with only 25 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple have lost their jobs,” he said. “We see a lot more in­di­vid­u­als com­ing in.”</p>
    <p>Com­pared with last year, Pan-Pa­cific’s busi­ness has in­creased by 80 per cent. The com­pany has hence in­creased its fleet from 1,500 last year to 1,800 this year.</p>
    <p>“By the end of the year, we will have an­other 200, bring­ing our to­tal to 2,000,” Mr Mok said, not­ing</p>
    <p>that the most sought-af­ter mod­els are the Toy­ota Hi­ace and Nis­san NV200 vans, as well as the Toy­ota Dyna truck.</p>
    <p>Ms Jeanne Kung, a share­holder of Rhino Rental, a com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle rental and leas­ing firm, said dis­tanc­ing rules due to Covid-19 have also driven up de­mand from trans­port com­pa­nies en­gaged to ferry work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously, a ve­hi­cle may be able to carry 13 work­ers, but now, it can carry only six,” Ms Kung said.</p>
    <p>She added that the busi­ness had been grow­ing steadily on the back of the e-com­merce trend, but the pan­demic has given it an ad­di­tional nudge.</p>
    <p>“I was quite wor­ried dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when all our</p>
    <p>ve­hi­cles came back. But one week into the lock­down, we be­gan to re­ceive a lot of in­quiries,” she said, not­ing that to­day, 74 out of its 77 ve­hi­cles are rented out, and the com­pany is look­ing to ex­pand its fleet.</p>
    <p>Over­all, Ms Kung said busi­ness has gone up by about 30 per cent, com­pared with last year, with most of the growth seen in the past two months or so.</p>
    <p>“Ear­lier in the year, it was quite bad,” she noted.</p>
    <p>Gold­bell Leas­ing, the big­gest player here with some 5,000 com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles, said its rental busi­ness has in­creased by 20 per cent, com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said the in­crease was mostly at­trib­ut­able to de­mand for vans from last-mile lo­gis­tics</p>
    <p>firms, par­tially off­set by weaker de­mand for heavy ve­hi­cles from con­struc­tion com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>One new de­liv­ery driver is Mr Chew Kian Tiong, who used to man a re­tail store in Re­sorts World Sen­tosa but lost his job when Covid-19 hit.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old joined Prime De­liv­ery less than a month ago, us­ing his own car to make de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>He said he is “pleas­antly sur­prised” that he is able to make two to four de­liv­er­ies a day, and earn on av­er­age $10 per de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>“On a per-hour ba­sis, it is equiv­a­lent to my previous job,” Mr Chew said.</p>
    <p>Asked why he did not want to be a full-time driver for ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tors, he said the work was “quite</p>
    <p>tax­ing and hours”.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor traders said the de­mand for com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles has been push­ing up the price of a com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE).</p>
    <p>At the lat­est ten­der last week, the com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE rose to hit a 21/ 2- year high of $33,089 – about $10,000 higher than its July pre­mium.</p>
    <p>Asked if the de­liv­ery trend would con­tinue if and when the pan­demic is con­tained, Pan-Pa­cific’s Mr Mok said: “Yes. Peo­ple are used to de­liv­er­ies al­ready. Like for my­self, I hardly go to the su­per­mar­ket any more.”</p>
    <p>in­volved very</p>
    <p>long</p>
