    <p>Re­silience Col­lec­tive (RC) helps peo­ple un­der­stand men­tal health as well as those who strug­gle with it through work­shops, pub­lic events and peer sup­port groups.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh Shuet-Li said: “Our planned work­shops and en­gage­ment events were im­me­di­ately at risk of be­ing aborted. For­tu­nately, the RC team’s IT ca­pa­bil­i­ties al­lowed for a rel­a­tively pain­less tran­si­tion into the dig­i­tal space.</p>
    <p>“But it was chal­leng­ing for some of our community. Not all had lap­tops – only mo­bile phones. Hence, it was not con­ducive for pre­sen­ta­tions and cer­tainly near im­pos­si­ble to be in­ter­ac­tive with dig­i­tal tools.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, the team’s en­gage­ment ses­sions al­lowed eye-to-eye con­tact, and par­tic­i­pants could ob­serve body lan­guage and pick up on nu­ances.</p>
    <p>When they had to move their pro­grammes on­line, the team had to be creative and think of dif­fer­ent ways of en­gage­ment, like us­ing word­cloud tools and dig­i­tal “emo­tional” re­sponses such as the clap and thumbs-up emo­jis on Zoom.</p>
    <p>The team worked to main­tain emo­tional con­nec­tions, which is key to peer sup­port and re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“The tough­est part about the pan­demic for us is know­ing that some of our community just could not join. Some, even if they were ca­pa­ble, were not able to due to a lack of IT equip­ment or poor net­work con­nec­tiv­ity. Oth­ers did not have con­ducive en­vi­ron­ments to al­low for their par­tic­i­pa­tion,” Ms Goh said.</p>
