    <p>1 CHEF KANG’S NOO­DLE HOUSE 11 Lorong 3 Toa Payoh, Block C Jack­son Square</p>
    <p>Open: Tues­days to Fri­days, 8am to 4pm; Satur­days and Sun­days, 8am to 2pm; closed on Mon­days</p>
    <p>Price: $6 and $11 (with shred­ded abalone)</p>
    <p>Opened by chef Ang Song Kang, this stall is run by two pro­teges from his one-Miche­lin-starred Chef Kang’s Chi­nese restau­rant in Macken­zie Road.</p>
    <p>He came up with the recipe, which lives up to his rep­u­ta­tion as one of the finest Can­tonese chefs here with restau­rant-qual­ity char siew and won­tons that you don’t find in any other hawker stall.</p>
    <p>The fatty char siew is sliced thickly to en­sure a good chew and plenty of meat juices. The pork is well-sea­soned and the mari­nade is not too sweet.</p>
    <p>You get two big and smooth won­tons preg­nant with minced pork and prawn, as well as sliv­ers of black fun­gus, that add crunch. They are served in a bowl of full­bod­ied, cloudy soup, an oft-over­looked com­po­nent of the dish that most hawk­ers pay scant at­ten­tion to.</p>
    <p>Only the thin, wiry noo­dles dis­ap­point a lit­tle. I find them a tad hard as I pre­fer smoother noo­dles with a stronger egg flavour. Still, they come with a gen­er­ous help­ing of the crispi­est deep-fried lard I have ever eaten.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>FOONG KEE COF­FEE SHOP (left) 6 Keong Saik Road</p>
    <p>Open: Mon­days to Fri­days, 11am to 8pm; Satur­days, 11am to 5.30pm; closed on Sun­days</p>
    <p>Price: $3.50</p>
    <p>This is an old-school roast meat rice stall that oc­cu­pies an en­tire cof­fee shop in Keong Saik Road, where al­most every­one or­ders the won­ton mee.</p>
    <p>The dish scores with ex­cel­lent char siew, juicy and flavour­ful with a bit of fat around the edges.</p>
    <p>The noo­dles, which are thin, smooth and a lit­tle springy, are good too. They are dressed in black sauce and chilli sauce – though the chilli, while pi­quant and spicy, is too sweet.</p>
    <p>The three won­tons, though, are a let­down. There is a skimpy piece of wa­ter chest­nut in the filling and too lit­tle meat. The skin is too thick too and the won­tons swim in a bland soup.</p>
    <p>Be pre­pared for a long wait. I joined the queue at 11.50am and got to the end of the line 20 min­utes later. But af­ter I placed my or­der, there was an­other 15-minute wait for the dish to be de­liv­ered to the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>FEI FEI ROASTED NOO­DLE</p>
    <p>Yuhua Vil­lage Mar­ket 01-28 Block 254</p>
    <p>Jurong East Street 24</p>
    <p>Open: Mon­days to Satur­days, 9.30am to 12.30pm; closed on Sun­days</p>
    <p>Price: $3.50</p>
    <p>This is an­other roast meat stall spe­cial­is­ing in char siew and roast duck. Its char siew is so pop­u­lar that it was sold out by 11am when I was there two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>I re­turned the next day, a Tues­day, but it was closed even though the stall’s stated rest day is Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It was third time lucky when, af­ter wait­ing in line for 35 min­utes a few days later, I man­aged to snag a plate of noo­dles at 10.30am.</p>
    <p>Sadly, the char siew – thin slices of lean meat – wasn’t worth the trou­ble. Per­haps it was co­in­ci­dence or poorer cuts were used for won­ton noo­dles be­cause I saw a man in front of me with a plate of lus­cious pieces of char siew and roast duck.</p>
    <p>The won­tons, with their soft and thin skin, how­ever, were what I was look­ing for. There was a piece of prawn snug­gled amid the minced pork in some won­tons, but not all. The springy noo­dles were tossed with a light blend of oys­ter sauce and lard, with­out dark soya sauce. It was rather ba­sic, so you may want to help your­self to some chilli sauce.</p>
    <p>Do not mis­take this for the Fei Fei Wan­ton Mee in Joo Chiat Place, which I do not rec­om­mend.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>WONG KEE WAN­TON NOO­DLES 01-06 Tim­bre+, 73A Ayer Ra­jah Cres­cent Open: Mon­days to Fri­days, 8am to 3.30pm; Satur­days, 7am to 2.30pm; closed on Sun­days Price: $4</p>
    <p>This old-time favourite from Maxwell Food Cen­tre got an up­date when it moved to hip­ster hawker cen­tre Tim­bre+ four years ago. It opened a sec­ond out­let at Fu­nan Mall last year.</p>
    <p>The stall makes ev­ery­thing in-house and does a good job. But there’s room for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>The noo­dles are springy, but not as smooth as I like. What stands out is the de­li­cious gravy you toss them with, and I ad­vise tast­ing the noo­dles first be­fore adding any chilli sauce. There are also bits of crispy lard, but th­ese tend to be small and hard.</p>
    <p>Two sprigs of kai lan – crunchy and fi­bre­less – top the dish, along with a heap of thickly sliced char siew. Plenty of bang for the buck.</p>
    <p>There are two deep-fried won­ton on the plate too and two boiled ones in a bowl of soup. Both are good. The freshly fried won­tons boast a crispy skin and the boiled ones, plump with a tasty pork filling, are en­cased in a thick, smooth skin. The soup is blah though.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>ENG’S CHAR SIEW WAN­TON MEE 248/250 Tan­jong Ka­tong Road Open: 10.30am to 8.45pm daily Price: $4.50</p>
    <p>This is opened by Mr Des­mond Ng, the son of the founder of Eng’s Wan Tan Mee. He fell out with his part­ners, af­ter they moved the orig­i­nal Dun­man Road stall to Tan­jong Ka­tong Road and re­named it Eng’s Noo­dles House (now called Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle).</p>
    <p>When I tried the noo­dles at both shops one af­ter the other last year, I could hardly tell them apart. But this time, I found they are quite dif­fer­ent. I pre­fer Mr Ng’s ver­sion. The noo­dles are firm and smooth, though I pre­fer them slightly more eggy. They come tossed with soya sauce and lard and taste rather plain on their own.</p>
    <p>But Eng’s fans go there for the chilli sauce, which is served in a saucer on the side. A dash of it im­me­di­ately brings the noo­dles to life. It is crazily hot though, so add a lit­tle at a time. The noo­dles are topped with crispy lard, three de­cent won­tons with soft, smooth skin filled with heav­ily sea­soned minced pork. But the thin slices of char siew are un­re­mark­able.</p>
