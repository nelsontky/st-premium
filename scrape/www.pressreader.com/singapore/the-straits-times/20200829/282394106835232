    <p>We know how good he is. Five wins from six out­ings. That’s how leg­ends start out. That’s what In­ferno has done so far.</p>
    <p>What we want to know is how good he RE­ALLY is?</p>
    <p>And just how much more can we expect from him?</p>
    <p>Don’t think too hard. We should find the an­swer at 5.30pm to­mor­row when In­ferno takes his place in the gates for the run­ning of the Sin­ga­pore Clas­sic.</p>
    <p>With the Kranji Mile done and dusted. The Mer­lion Tro­phy raced and run. And the Sin­ga­pore Derby set to go next Satur­day, the Sin­ga­pore Clas­sic looks like the meat in a juicy club sand­wich.</p>
    <p>Run over the tricky trip of 1,400m on the short course and on turf, it will test and take the best out of the win­ner.</p>
    <p>Owned by the Bar­ree Sta­ble and pre­pared for the races by Cliff Brown, In­ferno has been hum­ming along, never miss­ing a beat since his de­but in July last year.</p>
    <p>In this sport, 13 months isn’t a long time. Over that pe­riod, top race­horses might face the starter five, six or even seven times.</p>
    <p>In­ferno has been there six times and five times he has trot­ted into the win­ner’s cir­cle to have his pic­ture taken.</p>
    <p>The only s mudge to that sparkling re­port card was when he ran sec­ond to Siam War­rior in a</p>
    <p>Class 3 sprint in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>It sul­lied an oth­er­wise im­pec­ca­ble record. But, like the good horse that he is, In­ferno bounced back in his very next start to stamp his au­thor­ity on his Kranji ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Come Sun­day, and again – if he is as good as we think he is – the Sin­ga­pore Clas­sic should be at his mercy.</p>
    <p>In­deed, and if he is as ter­ri­fy­ing as his name seems to sug­gest, this sce­nario could un­fold.</p>
    <p>In­ferno, with cham­pion jockey Vlad Duric in the sad­dle, will clear the No. 7 chute ef­fort­lessly.</p>
    <p>Once set­tled in his stride, he will take a spot just off mid­field as the fron­trun­ners – most likely Sweet An­ge­line and Mr Malek and, per­haps, Knight Love or Strong N Pow­er­ful – blaze a trail for him.</p>
    <p>Duric will play the preda­tor. Al­ways alert, al­ways lurk­ing, he will stalk the speed. Top of the straight and swing­ing for the run home, In­ferno will shift into a higher gear.</p>
    <p>If this were a “nor­mal” race day, that will be the time for the crowd in the grand­stand to erupt. They will roar be­cause they will know what’s go­ing to hap­pen. In one swift cull, In­ferno will quite clin­i­cally break the hearts and spir­its of his ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Alas, this year, the stands will be eerily empty.</p>
    <p>But, we reckon, it will not di­min­ish In­ferno’s in­tent.</p>
    <p>Again, and if he is as good as we think he is, he will charge to the front and, as I see it, put the gutsy mare Sweet An­ge­line to the sword.</p>
    <p>His corona­tion com­plete, he will trot back to the sta­bles – con­tent as a cat but still burn­ing with de­sire.</p>
    <p>In the best pos­si­ble way, he would have an­swered the ques­tion we posed at the start of this piece.</p>
    <p>Yes, In­ferno’s good. Re­ally good. And you can take that to the bank.</p>
