    <p>Medtecs In­ter­na­tional shares fell back to earth yes­ter­day af­ter ini­tially shoot­ing up on the back of stel­lar third-quar­ter re­sults that were boosted by ex­plo­sive global de­mand for per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE).</p>
    <p>The Catal­ist-listed stock climbed by as much as 7.4 per cent in the morn­ing ses­sion, but then went into re­verse to close 8 per cent down at $1.36, with 75 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>The counter was the third-most ac­tively traded on the bourse, with around 70 large trades – each val­ued over $150,000 – recorded in the morn­ing ses­sion, noted ShareIn­vestor.</p>
    <p>Medtecs shares ral­lied this year amid the Covid-19 out­break and are up around 4,140 per cent from 3.7 cents at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>The firm re­ported af­ter markets closed on Tues­day that third-quar­ter rev­enue jumped 636 per cent to US$124.6 mil­lion (S$169.2 mil­lion) com­pared with a year ear­lier, while net profit surged by 1,115 per cent to US$45.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has sparked a global de­mand for PPE, which the com­pany ex­pects to re­main strong given the prospect of a</p>
    <p>Pro­por­tion of turnover con­tributed by Medtecs’ own prod­uct la­bel in the nine months to Sept 30. vac­cine is still un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Medtecs has been pro­vid­ing on­estop, bun­dled ser­vices to meet de­mand for head-to-toe pro­tec­tion by sup­ple­ment­ing its ex­ist­ing prod­ucts with those from third-party ven­dors. It also used e-com­merce plat­forms and data anal­y­sis to source po­ten­tial cus­tomers and new ven­dors.</p>
    <p>The firm has de­vel­oped its own CoverU line of PPE. Sales of prod­ucts car­ry­ing its own la­bel made up more than 68 per cent of to­tal turnover in the nine months to Sept 30, it noted on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“With long-term in­dica­tive or­ders in hand and sta­bil­is­ing raw ma­te­rial prices, the com­pany ex­pects to re­port record rev­enue and profit in the fourth quar­ter and fi­nan­cial year end­ing Dec 31,” it added.</p>
