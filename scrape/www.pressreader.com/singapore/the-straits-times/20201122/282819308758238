    <p>Many of us shove our in­sur­ance poli­cies into the drawer and give them no fur­ther thought, yet they are prob­a­bly the se­cond-most valu­able “as­set” fam­i­lies have af­ter their homes.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, it is not un­com­mon for peo­ple to take out life poli­cies to in­sure them­selves for hun­dreds of thousands or even mil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Those earn­ing de­cent in­comes will prob­a­bly spend tens of thousands of dol­lars or more an­nu­ally on pre­mi­ums for whole life, en­dow­ment and in­vest­ment-linked poli­cies.</p>
    <p>If you add up all the pre­mi­ums that you have been pay­ing over the past cou­ple of decades, you may be sur­prised to learn that you have prob­a­bly paid at least $100,000 or more.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, many peo­ple ac­tu­ally know very lit­tle about the worth of their poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Most of us will know the in­sured sum that is payable upon death or when hit by crit­i­cal ill­nesses be­cause th­ese sums were what we signed up for in the first place.</p>
    <p>While some may be dili­gent enough to keep track of the sur­ren­der val­ues of their poli­cies, most will not know their ex­act worth when they reach, say, the age of 65.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if you had signed up for your poli­cies be­fore the early 2000s, you might have been shown a set of pro­jected val­ues for them when you hit 65. But those es­ti­mates are likely to be in­ac­cu­rate now be­cause they would not have fac­tored in two ma­jor events that would af­fect val­ues – the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008 and the cur­rent global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This raises the mil­lion-dol­lar ques­tion: How can you ef­fec­tively plan for re­tire­ment if you do not know the fu­ture worth of your in­sur­ance poli­cies?</p>
    <p>This is some­thing Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Den­nis Tan is keen to ad­dress so that pol­i­cy­hold­ers have bet­ter clar­ity on the value of prod­ucts they have in­vested in.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan told In­vest: “I ab­so­lutely agree that there is a need for more trans­parency in the busi­ness of in­sur­ance so that pol­i­cy­hold­ers will gain more con­fi­dence in their in­sur­ers over time.”</p>
    <p>Un­like the much cheaper term plans that pro­vide only cov­er­age but hold no value, whole life and other poli­cies are more pop­u­lar with fam­i­lies as they are seen as part of their re­tire­ment as­sets due to their in­trin­sic value.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, most pol­i­cy­hold­ers can now log in any time to check the worth of their port­fo­lios, such as the sur­ren­der val­ues and the to­tal “cash bonuses” that have been earned.</p>
    <p>But what is miss­ing from those num­bers is the pro­jected value of the poli­cies at re­tire­ment age, which is cru­cial in­for­ma­tion for those want­ing to plan ahead.</p>
    <p>This is not easy to es­ti­mate be­cause most poli­cies have a com­bi­na­tion of guar­an­teed and nonguar­an­teed re­turns.</p>
    <p>But to make it more trans­par­ent, in­sur­ance com­pa­nies should per­haps make pro­jec­tions based on their best- and worst-case sce­nar­ios, re­ly­ing on guide­lines set by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan adds that the flex­i­bil­ity of al­low­ing pol­i­cy­hold­ers to see a few years ahead or be­yond will cer­tainly en­hance knowl­edge and trust. “In­sur­ance prod­ucts have come a long way. Per­haps the time has come for an­other evo­lu­tion,” Mr Tan says.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, Mr Alfred Chia, chief ex­ec­u­tive of fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm SingCap­i­tal, says: “For now, pol­i­cy­hold­ers should have the habit of re­view­ing their num­bers an­nu­ally to see how much their poli­cies are worth and not be caught by surprise when they are closer to re­tire­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gilbert Pak, chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer at Tokio Marine Life In­sur­ance Sin­ga­pore, notes that even if in­sur­ers can give the best pos­si­ble es­ti­mates, such num­bers may not be eas­ily un­der­stood. Hence, it is still bet­ter for pol­i­cy­hold­ers to get in touch with their in­sur­ance con­sul­tants for a more in-depth ex­pla­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Aviva Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Nishit Ma­j­mu­dar notes that in­sur­ers are still try­ing to fig­ure out how best to make ben­e­fit pro­jec­tions more trans­par­ent.</p>
    <p>“It is fair for cus­tomers to ex­pect in­for­ma­tion to be read­ily avail­able on­line. But as re­tire­ment plan­ning is a long-term af­fair, we wel­come cus­tomers to write to or call our fi­nan­cial con­sul­tants, even if it takes a bit more time.”</p>
    <p>When pre­mi­ums be­come a fi­nan­cial bur­den</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple also do not re­alise that they have to pay the pre­mi­ums of most of their in­sur­ance poli­cies for life.</p>
    <p>You will not have prob­lems pay­ing as long as you are work­ing but once you re­tire, the pre­mi­ums could be­come a fi­nan­cial bur­den.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine this sce­nario: You pay be­tween $10,000 and $20,000 an­nu­ally for all in­sur­ance poli­cies and you plan to stop work­ing at 6 5 . Wo u l d y o u h a v e u p to $400,000 in ad­di­tional sav­ings that will al­low you to con­tinue pay­ing for your poli­cies un­til 85?</p>
    <p>If your an­swer is no, here are some op­tions to con­sider:</p>
    <p>END SOME AND KEEP OTH­ERS</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with mul­ti­ple poli­cies have the op­tion of sur­ren­der­ing some to reap the cash val­ues that have ac­crued. Af­ter all, this is what re­tire­ment plan­ning is all about. You should set a date to start en­joy­ing the fruits of your labour and not just think about sav­ing all the time.</p>
    <p>But you must re­tain one or two crit­i­cal poli­cies – such as hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and life plans – so that you are still cov­ered in your re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>USE AC­CRUED BONUSES TO PAY THE PRE­MIUM</p>
    <p>Most long­stand­ing poli­cies would have ac­cu­mu­lated cash bonuses, so if you do not want to keep pay­ing the pre­mi­ums, you can tell the in­surer to use the bonuses to off­set your pre­mi­ums un­til the amount runs out.</p>
    <p>But this will re­duce the value of your poli­cies, so you have to de­cide whether you want the cov­er­age or en­joy your cash ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>ASK FOR A FIXED PAY­MENT PLAN</p>
    <p>A bet­ter way to avoid pay­ing pre­mi­ums for life is to make plans early, such as ask­ing for a fixed pay­ment pe­riod.</p>
    <p>So when you sign up for a new pol­icy, make it clear to your in­surer that you want to stop pre­mium pay­ments at, say, age 60, but want to con­tinue to en­joy the cov­er­age and ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>You will end up pay­ing a higher pre­mium, but do­ing so in your pro­duc­tive years is more pru­dent than liv­ing with fi­nan­cial un­cer­tainty in old age.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Pru­den­tial has a flex­i­ble pay­ment scheme be­cause it al­lows its pol­i­cy­hold­ers to dic­tate their own pay­ment pe­ri­ods for new poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan notes that the dif­fi­culty of pay­ing pre­mi­ums dur­ing re­tire­ment res­onates with many peo­ple. “There­fore, we al­low our cus­tomers to make their choices and we are very flex­i­ble in our pric­ing phi­los­o­phy. They can choose to pay within any spe­cific years and when this is done, the whole pol­icy is con­sid­ered fully paid up and all the ben­e­fits will be ac­crued to you.”</p>
    <p>Aviva’s Mr Ma­j­mu­dar notes that job un­cer­tain­ties have prompted some peo­ple to con­sider poli­cies that have a fixed pay­ment pe­riod, in case they lose their jobs.</p>
    <p>“While not all poli­cies have such fea­tures, those who want this op­tion should ask for poli­cies that have longer cov­er­age pe­ri­ods than their pre­mium pay­ing pe­riod,” he says.</p>
    <p>Tokio Marine Life’s Mr Pak has this ad­vice: If you have bought a pol­icy that is payable for life, get in touch with your in­surer to see whether you can opt to shorten the pay­ment pe­riod by pay­ing higher pre­mi­ums now.</p>
    <p>MORE CLAR­ITY NEEDED</p>
    <p>I ab­so­lutely agree that there is a need for more trans­parency in the busi­ness of in­sur­ance so that pol­i­cy­hold­ers will gain more con­fi­dence in their in­sur­ers over time.</p>
    <p>PRU­DEN­TIAL SIN­GA­PORE CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE DEN­NIS TAN, on the need for pol­i­cy­hold­ers to have bet­ter clar­ity on the value of prod­ucts they have in­vested in.</p>
    <p>DON’T BE CAUGHT OFF GUARD</p>
    <p>For now, pol­i­cy­hold­ers should have the habit of re­view­ing their num­bers an­nu­ally to see how much their poli­cies are worth and not be caught by surprise when they are closer to re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>MR ALFRED CHIA, chief ex­ec­u­tive of fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firm SingCap­i­tal.</p>
