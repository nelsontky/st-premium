    <p>Sin­ga­pore is closely watch­ing the sit­u­a­tion in coun­tries with which it has travel agree­ments – es­pe­cially those see­ing a resur­gence in Covid-19 in­fec­tions, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung.</p>
    <p>Even as the case num­bers spike in coun­tries such as Ger­many and In­done­sia, with which Sin­ga­pore has green lane ar­range­ments for busi­ness travel, it is im­por­tant to fig­ure out which groups are get­ting in­fected, he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In the case of re­cip­ro­cal green lanes, it is tar­geted at busi­ness trav­ellers. And among these groups, more likely... their case rates are l ower,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The risks of im­port­ing Covid-19 cases from these coun­tries are fur­ther mit­i­gated by other pre­cau­tions be­ing ob­served, such as Covid-19 test­ing and a con­trolled itinerary, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong was re­spond­ing to the con­cerns that have been raised about Sin­ga­pore’s re­cip­ro­cal green lane for busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel with Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man au­thor­i­ties re­cently an­nounced plans for a lock­down next month af­ter a surge in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>“We have to un­der­stand where the cases are, and which seg­ment of so­ci­ety is not ac­tu­ally (reg­is­ter­ing) a high num­ber of cases,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>When case num­bers soared in Sin­ga­pore, the coun­try had also at one point faced per­cep­tion is­sues, he noted, even though the surge was largely on ac­count of the coro­n­avirus spread­ing in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries here.</p>
    <p>“When Sin­ga­pore was hav­ing hun­dreds of Covid-19 cases ev­ery day, we were still liv­ing life quite nor­mally be­cause we know that in our com­mu­nity, the num­ber of cases is low,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The truth is there are dif­fer­ent seg­ments and dif­fer­ent ge­og­ra­phy in most coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong added that Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion on which coun­tries to have travel ar­range­ments with is backed by analy­ses of their epi­demic re­sponses by health­care pro­fes­sion­als in the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>Among the fac­tors that are stud­ied are a coun­try’s level of con­tact trac­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and its level of test­ing.</p>
    <p>“It is in the science, ev­ery­thing has to be sci­en­tif­i­cally backed up,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said he per­son­ally checks on the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in sev­eral coun­tries daily.</p>
    <p>He stressed that it was crit­i­cal for Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue to open up its skies, even in the cur­rent cli­mate.</p>
    <p>“This is not just about eco­nomic growth, this is about mak­ing sure that we still have a strong air­port, mak­ing sure that we still have Sin­ga­pore Air­lines... and mak­ing sure that Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to ex­ist.”</p>
