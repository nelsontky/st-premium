    <p>LON­DON • Brent­ford and Ful­ham will slug it out for a place in the Pre­mier League to­day when they clash in the Cham­pi­onship play-off fi­nal worth an es­ti­mated £170 mil­lion (S$306 mil­lion) to the win­ners.</p>
    <p>The re­wards for pro­mo­tion mean the Wem­b­ley show­down is of­ten called the rich­est match in world foot­ball.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 73 years out­side the English top flight, un­fash­ion­able Brent­ford are within touch­ing dis­tance of an un­ex­pected berth among the elite. In con­trast, Ful­ham are hop­ing for a re­turn to the Pre­mier League af­ter last sea­son’s rel­e­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>It is Brent­ford’s story that has cap­tured the imag­i­na­tion of neu­trals. Af­ter spend­ing 59 out of 60 sea­sons in the third or fourth tiers be­fore reach­ing the Cham­pi­onship in 2014, the Bees have risen well above their tra­di­tional sta­tus thanks to in­no­va­tive owner Matthew Ben­ham.</p>
    <p>He has in­tro­duced an an­a­lyt­ics-in­flu­enced ap­proach over­seen by two di­rec­tors of foot­ball, en­sur­ing the club make the most of their mea­gre re­sources.</p>
    <p>It has proved a suc­cess­ful for­mula as Brent­ford un­earthed gems such as Neal Mau­pay, Ezri Konsa, Chris Mepham and Jota be­fore sell­ing them for sig­nif­i­cant prof­its.</p>
    <p>Ol­lie Watkins, Said Ben­rahma and Bryan Mbeumo are the lat­est stars off the pro­duc­tion line.</p>
    <p>The trio took Brent­ford to the brink of au­to­matic pro­mo­tion last month be­fore suc­ces­sive de­feats against Stoke and Barns­ley forced them to set­tle for third place.</p>
    <p>A 3-1 win over Swansea in the play-off semi-fi­nal se­cond leg over­turned a 1-0 first-leg deficit and em­pha­sised the qual­ity nur­tured by Brent­ford boss Thomas Frank.</p>
    <p>Brent­ford beat Ful­ham 1-0 and 2-0 ear­lier this sea­son and their cap­tain Pontus Jansson knows what it would mean to get that third win.</p>
    <p>“It’s quite ob­vi­ous, for the club it means ev­ery­thing,” he said. “This is what we’re fight­ing for as a club for a lot of years, es­pe­cially this year.</p>
    <p>“We know the fi­nan­cial thing of play­ing in the Pre­mier League, it’s one of the big­gest fees, if not the big­gest, in the world.”</p>
    <p>Ful­ham would love to spoil the fairy tale, but their hopes would be dam­aged if Ser­bia striker Alek­san­dar Mitro­vic is un­able to re­turn from a ham­string in­jury. The Cham­pi­onship’s top scorer with 26 goals this sea­son missed both legs of their 3-2 ag­gre­gate play-off semi-fi­nal vic­tory over Cardiff.</p>
    <p>“I’m hope­ful – he was close to play­ing the se­cond leg,” Ful­ham man­ager Scott Parker said.</p>
    <p>“We’ll just do ev­ery­thing we can to try to have him ready.”</p>
