    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Michael Jor­dan’s “The Shot” in the 1989 play­offs is among the most mem­o­rable buzzer-beat­ers in Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) his­tory.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Luka Don­cic put him­self in the same cat­e­gory with his last-gasp three-pointer in over­time. The All-Star guard joined Jor­dan as the only play­ers in post-sea­son his­tory to cap a 40-point per­for­mance with a buzzer-beater while trail­ing.</p>
    <p>The Slove­nian had a triple-dou­ble as he lifted the Dal­las Mav­er­icks to a 135-133 vic­tory over NBA con­tenders Los An­ge­les Clip­pers and even up their Western Con­fer­ence first-round se­ries at two games apiece.</p>
    <p>It was, how­ever, no or­di­nary triple-dou­ble.</p>
    <p>In chalk­ing up a game-high 43 points, 17 re­bounds and 13 as­sists in Game 4 at Dis­ney World, the reign­ing Rookie of the Year be­came only the third player and the youngest to score at least 40 points, 15 re­bounds and 10 as­sists in a play-off game. The 21-year-old matched NBA greats Charles Barkley and Os­car Robert­son in the process, with only Wilt Cham­ber­lain go­ing one bet­ter – and that was in the reg­u­lar sea­son.</p>
    <p>The fact that he did so on a bad an­kle and with­out his All-Star team­mate Kristaps Porzingis, who did not play be­cause of a sore knee, left ESPN per­son­al­i­ties Max Keller­man and Stephen A. Smith in awe.</p>
    <p>Smith later tweeted that Don­cic was “the truth”, but the Mav­er­icks star, who was game-time de­ci­sion af­ter in­jur­ing his an­kle in Game 3, was quick to re­di­rect the praise to his team’s med­i­cal staff.</p>
    <p>“The guys that you don’t hear about be­hind (the scenes) did an amaz­ing job with me yes­ter­day,” he said. “We were work­ing al­most the whole day. They were help­ing me out the whole time, what­ever I needed. I ob­vi­ously wasn’t 100 per cent, but I think I was good.”</p>
    <p>On his step-back jumper at the death that will be talked about in sea­sons to come, Don­cic said: “I can’t ex­plain the emo­tions I had. Not only when the ball goes in but when I see the whole team run­ning to­ward me.</p>
    <p>“That was some­thing spe­cial, one of the best feel­ings I ever had as a player. Just some­thing spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>Call­ing Don­cic “com­pletely fear­less”, his coach Rick Carlisle added: “We know this kid has got a flair for the dra­matic. He’s a per­former as well as a great player. He’s a guy that lives for th­ese mo­ments.”</p>
    <p>While Dal­las showed plenty of heart, dis­play­ing again why many be­lieve they are dark horses in the West, the sec­ond-seeded Clip­pers are now at a cross­roads in their match-up, with their op­po­nents in the groove.</p>
    <p>Game 4 ap­peared to be theirs to lose when Porzingis was ruled out, only for a lack­lus­tre show­ing that was com­pounded by yet another poor night by Paul Ge­orge.</p>
    <p>Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Kawhi Leonard paced his team with 32 points, but his All-Star team­mate had just nine points.</p>
    <p>In his past three games, Ge­orge has shot 10-for-47 over­all, lead­ing Barkley to roast the for­ward, who has never won the cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“You can’t be call­ing your­self ‘Play-off P’ and lose all the time,” he said.</p>
    <p>Clip­pers coach Doc Rivers was just as frus­trated at his play­ers ahead of Game 5 to­day, say­ing: “Hon­estly, I thought we were very emo­tion­ally weak tonight. If I knew (why), I would be Sig­mund Freud.”</p>
    <p>Else­where in the West, Donovan Mitchell had 51 points to help Utah out­last the Den­ver Nuggets for a 129-127 win, giv­ing the Jazz a 3-1 lead in their first-round se­ries.</p>
    <p>It was his sec­ond 50-point game in a week, be­com­ing just the third player af­ter Jor­dan and Allen Iver­son to score 50 points twice in the same play-off match-up.</p>
    <p>LET IT ALL SINK IN</p>
    <p>Not only when the ball goes in but when I see the whole team run­ning to­ward me. That was some­thing spe­cial, one of the best feel­ings I ever had.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>LUKA DON­CIC, Mav­er­icks guard.</p>
