    <p>The zom­bie spec­tac­u­lar Train To</p>
    <p>Bu­san: Penin­sula (NC16, 116 min­utes, ) steams into the sta­tion just as Sin­ga­pore cin­e­mas swing their doors open af­ter be­ing closed for more than three months to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The tim­ing is im­pec­ca­ble – this highly an­tic­i­pated film will not only be the re­open­ing’s cen­tre­piece movie, but it also serves as a test of pub­lic feel­ing about cin­e­mas. If this won’t bring them back, noth­ing will.</p>
    <p>The first movie, Train To Bu­san, holds the record as the high­est­gross­ing South Korean film in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Those block­buster am­bi­tions are revved to the fullest in the tyre-squeal­ing, fender-bend­ing se­quel. As in the first movie, the plot here can be summed up as: Go from point A to point B and don’t die.</p>
    <p>Four years af­ter the events of the first movie, the un­dead have over­run the Korean penin­sula, so it has been aban­doned and sealed, with es­capees liv­ing as de­spised mi­nori­ties in other parts of Asia. In Hong Kong, Jung-suk (Gang Dong-won), a bit­ter ex-sol­dier who lost every­one he loved dur­ing the evac­u­a­tion, meets with triad bosses, who dan­gle an of­fer of a fresh start if he makes a risky raid in his for­mer home­land to re­trieve looted cash.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with a new cast and new set­ting, di­rec­tor and co-writer Yeon Sang-ho has ex­tracted the essence of the first movie – a fam­ily sur­vival drama – and in­jected it into the se­quel. De­spite ob­vi­ous lift­ing from ac­tion fare such as John Car­pen­ter’s Es­cape From New York (1981) and Ge­orge Miller’s</p>
    <p>Mad Max movies (in par­tic­u­lar, Mad Max Be­yond Thun­der­dome, 1985; and Mad Max: Fury Road, 2015), he re­tains the first film’s ten­der fam­ily emo­tions, which raise the stakes of the mis­sion, mak­ing it more than a man ver­sus horde match-up.</p>
    <p>Now that every­one in the Train To Bu­san cin­e­matic uni­verse has guns, ex­plo­sives and fast cars, Yeon’s movie is a bona fide ac­tion spec­tac­u­lar.</p>
    <p>The first movie’s use of real train sets and props made it spe­cial, so this film’s over-re­liance on com­puter-ren­dered ve­hic­u­lar may­hem makes it look like a video game. The fi­nale’s over­cooked tear­jerker mo­ment will have most groan­ing in their seats. None­the­less, it is clear that the film-maker has another win­ner on his hands.</p>
    <p>Char­l­ize Theron was the star of Mad Max: Fury Road, one of Penin­sula’s in­spi­ra­tions, and she now stars in The Old Guard (R21, 125 min­utes, Net­flix, )a fan­tasy-ac­tion movie in which she plays Andy, the leader of a group of immortal mercenarie­s who take jobs that agree with her in­stinct-driven moral code.</p>
    <p>In other words, the story, adapted from a graphic novel, has roots in any fran­chise built on a group of out­cast do-good­ers with spe­cial pow­ers. Where this de­parts from the tem­plate is in its forth­right so­cial jus­tice stance. The X-Men films (2000 to 2019), for ex­am­ple, were al­lu­sive, hint­ing at how its mu­tant he­roes are vil­i­fied in the same way as, say, gay per­sons or civil rights ac­tivists. The Old Guard goes there: The crew are ex­plic­itly pro-gay (note the R21 rat­ing), pro-women’s rights and anti-slave traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Gina PrinceB­lythe­wood slip­streams proso­cial themes into the story-driven vi­o­lence so smoothly al­most no preach­i­ness can be de­tected.</p>
    <p>But it suf­fers from the fa­tigue-in­duc­ing cin­e­matic crime of “eth­i­cal” vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>In some films, hordes of easy-to-kill an­droids are mowed down. Here, end­less ranks of anony­mous black-clad sol­diers fall blood­lessly, over and over.</p>
    <p>De­spite that, this is mostly a good at­tempt at an ac­tion movie that wears its val­ues on its bul­let-rid­dled sleeve.</p>
    <p>Es­cape From Pre­to­ria (PG, 116 min­utes, ) is another val­ues-driven movie, but in the bi­o­graph­i­cal prison-es­cape genre. Based on the book by Tim Jenkin, played here by Daniel Rad­cliffe, it tells the true story of Jenkin and</p>
    <p>Stephen Lee (Daniel Web­ber), two po­lit­i­cal pris­on­ers housed in the whites-only wing of Pre­to­ria Cen­tral Prison. In 1970s apartheid-era South Africa, even pris­ons were seg­re­gated.</p>
    <p>At heart, this is a pro­ce­dural thriller that cre­ates ten­sion from the duo’s schemes and re­sult­ing pay-offs. The big scheme, of course, is to break out.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor and co-writer Fran­cis An­nan breaks down each step to cre­ate well-paced sus­pense. That ca­per is skil­fully set against a prison en­vi­ron­ment shaped by racist pol­icy, shown here to be a lad­der climbed most eas­ily by the cruel and ma­nip­u­la­tive.</p>
    <p>Another biopic run­ning this week is Mr Jones (M18, 119 min­utes), a diary of young jour­nal­ist Gareth Jones (James Nor­ton) who trav­elled to the Soviet Union in 1933. At the time, re­ports of the eco­nomic mir­a­cle wrought by strong­man Joseph Stalin left in­tel­lec­tu­als in the West daz­zled, but Jones is wit­ness to the hor­ri­fy­ing truth.</p>
    <p>Other films screen­ing this week in­clude Low Sea­son (PG13,</p>
    <p>125 min­utes), a Thai su­per­nat­u­ral ro­man­tic com­edy about Lin (Ploy­pailin Thang­pra­pa­porna), a woman whose abil­ity to see spir­its in­trigues screenwrit­er Put (Mario Mau­rer) while both are at a re­sort. Tai­wanese hor­ror work The</p>
    <p>Bridge Curse (NC16, 88 min­utes) con­cerns a creepy bridge wreathed in legends of sui­cide and dis­ap­pear­ances. Jour­nal­ist Shu-yu (Sum­mer Meng) de­cides that she will un­earth the truth.</p>
