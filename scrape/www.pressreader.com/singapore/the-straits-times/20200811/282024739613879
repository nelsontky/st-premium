    <p>Elec­tric-car shar­ing ser­vice BlueSG has hit one mil­lion ve­hi­cle ren­tals since the pro­gramme started in 2017.</p>
    <p>BlueSG now has around 80,000 sub­scribers pay­ing from $8 a month to use one of its 667 Blue­cars, it said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The firm is sup­ported by the Land Trans­port Author­ity and the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>De­spite a dip in mem­ber­ship and ren­tals dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, BlueSG recorded strong growth af­ter Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing from June 2, the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>The 667 cars in its fleet are rented about 100,000 times a month with 4,000 sub­scrip­tions added ev­ery month, said BlueSG man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Franck Vitte.</p>
    <p>He added that sur­veys show that its users are rent­ing cars oc­ca­sion­ally, as a com­ple­ment to pub­lic trans­port, which was the ini­tial ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>The firm launched two new sub­scrip­tion plans last De­cem­ber which have been suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>One is a pre­mium six-month mem­ber­ship plan at $18 a month with 45 min­utes of monthly free use and a ba­sic mem­ber­ship at $8 a month. Both plans have a rental rate of 33 cents a minute.</p>
    <p>BlueSG has other rental pack­ages for longer rides at cheaper rates – a three-hour deal at $39.90 and a five-hour one at $49.90.</p>
    <p>It has 345 charg­ing sta­tions with 1,371 charg­ing points is­land­wide in pub­lic hous­ing es­tates, in­dus­trial build­ings, shop­ping malls, Changi Air­port, Sen­tosa and the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>There are 239 charg­ing points across 60 sta­tions open to elec­tric-ve­hi­cle own­ers at a one­time fee of $20. These cost $1 an hour for the first three hours and then $2 an hour.</p>
    <p>“With a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of sta­tions lo­cated in pop­u­lar and con­ve­nient lo­ca­tions, BlueSG has now be­come a cred­i­ble al­ter­na­tive to pri­vate car own­er­ship,” said Mr Vitte.</p>
