    <p>The Demo­crat-led United States House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives has voted over­whelm­ingly to meet Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s de­mand to more than triple Covid-19 relief cheques to US$2,000 (S$2,650).</p>
    <p>Ac­tion has now turned to the Se­nate, where Repub­li­cans in con­trol have com­plained that the higher amount will add hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars to an al­ready mas­sive coro­n­avirus relief pack­age.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON The Democra­tled US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives has voted 275-134 to meet Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s de­mand for US$2,000 (S$2,650) Covid-19 relief cheques, send­ing the mea­sure on to the Repub­li­can-con­trolled Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump last week threat­ened to block a mas­sive pan­demic aid and spending pack­age if Congress did not boost stim­u­lus pay­ments from US$600 to US$2,000 and cut other spending. He later backed down from his de­mands as a pos­si­ble gov­ern­ment shut­down loomed.</p>
    <p>But Demo­cratic law­mak­ers have long wanted much big­ger relief cheques and used the rare point of agree­ment with Mr Trump to ad­vance the pro­posal in the vote on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The 275 votes for pas­sage meant the stim­u­lus pro­posal nar­rowly ex­ceeded the two-thirds of votes cast needed. A to­tal of 130 Repub­li­cans, two in­de­pen­dents and two Democrats op­posed it.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump fi­nally signed the US$2.3 tril­lion pack­age into law on Sun­day after hold­ing it up with a veiled veto threat. But he con­tin­ued de­mand­ing US$2,000 cheques. The US$2.3 tril­lion in­cludes US$1.4 tril­lion in spending to fund gov­ern­ment agen­cies and US$892 bil­lion in Covid-19 relief.</p>
    <p>It is not clear how the mea­sure to in­crease aid cheques will fare in the Se­nate, where Repub­li­cans have said the higher amount will add hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars to the relief Bill. The Se­nate was due to con­vene yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The US$2,000 pay­ments will go to in­di­vid­ual adults with an ad­justed gross in­come of up to US$75,000 a year based on 2019 earn­ings. Heads of house­holds who earn up to US$112,500 and a cou­ple (or some­one whose spouse died in 2020) who make up to US$150,000 a year would get twice that amount.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has led to wide­spread eco­nomic hard­ship in the United States, with mil­lions of fam­i­lies re­ly­ing on un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ap­proval of the stim­u­lus pack­age will keep the list­ing US econ­omy afloat, but help for those most in need might not come right away.</p>
    <p>The de­lay in sign­ing it into law means two wel­fare pro­grammes briefly ex­pired on Dec 26, and states may take weeks to restart pay­ments. The hold-up might have cost unem­ployed peo­ple a week of ben­e­fits, and could lead to a gap stretch­ing as long as three weeks in which the job­less will not get paid.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been run­ning with zero in­come for the past cou­ple of weeks. Any­time that you don’t have in­come hurts,” said Ari­zona res­i­dent Car­son Noel, 51, who has not been able to work in the live events in­dus­try since the pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment aid in the US is ad­min­is­tered by in­di­vid­ual states and ter­ri­to­ries, and many sys­tems are over­whelmed and re­liant on badly out­dated tech­nol­ogy that may not be able to easily re­ac­ti­vate a ben­e­fit pro­gramme that had just been de­ac­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>“The fact that they have to roll ev­ery­body off and they have to roll ev­ery­body back on, it’s not go­ing to go smoothly in any cir­cum­stances,” said Mr An­drew Stet­tner of The Cen­tury Foun­da­tion think-tank, which es­ti­mated 12 mil­lion peo­ple were de­pend­ing on these pro­grammes that would have lapsed had the new stim­u­lus Bill not been passed.</p>
    <p>Ph­le­botomist Deb­o­rah Lee, 58, whose di­a­betes meant she had to leave a job at a hospi­tal where she feared con­tract­ing Covid-19, has been try­ing to keep her fam­ily afloat on the US$240 per week that Ari­zona pays in un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits – one of the low­est amounts in the coun­try, which she says is “im­pos­si­ble” to live on.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee has al­ready drawn on her re­tire­ment sav­ings, and wor­ries what a gap in ben­e­fits might do to her al­ready strapped house­hold where only her daugh­ter works, while her three grand­chil­dren at­tend on­line school.</p>
    <p>“It scares me to think about it. I still have a car pay­ment, I still have auto in­sur­ance that has to be paid. It’s just kind of tak­ing it day by day,” she said.</p>
