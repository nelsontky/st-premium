    <p>Changi Air­port has launched its first on­line shop­ping cam­paign, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic drives more re­tail­ers to in­tro­duce vir­tual plat­forms to cater to shift­ing shop­ping pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Its cam­paign runs for seven weeks, from now un­til Oct 11, on iShopChang­i. It will fea­ture weekly deals for nearly 9,000 tax- and duty-ab­sorbed prod­ucts, in­clud­ing elec­tron­ics and beauty items as well as wines and spir­its. Tax- and duty-ab­sorbed prod­ucts are items for which duty and tax are ab­sorbed by the store.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers can ex­pect vouch­ers, re­wards and deals of var­i­ous amounts, sub­ject to lim­ited re­demp­tion quan­ti­ties as well as other terms and con­di­tions. For ex­am­ple, they can re­ceive dis­counts of up to 60 per cent on se­lect prod­ucts on Thurs­days.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign also in­volves livestream­ed ses­sions that will fea­ture per­son­al­i­ties such as home-grown YouTube chan­nel Night Owl Cine­mat­ics’ Aiken Chia and Sylvia Chan, and life­style por­tal TheS­martLo­cal’s Xe­nia Tan and Fauzi Aziz.</p>
    <p>They will take part in live challenges while re­view­ing prod­uct deals of the week in each 40-minute ses­sion held at 10pm on Thurs­days. Celebri­ties such as ac­tress Joanne Peh will also make ap­pear­ances to share tips on their skin­care and beauty reg­i­mens.</p>
    <p>More de­tails are avail­able at www.ishopchang­i.com/en/ cam­paigns/ish­opathon</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port’s cam­paign comes amid a slug­gish re­tail en­vi­ron­ment that is prompt­ing many re­tail­ers to move on­line.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales in June fell, al­beit at a slower pace than in the pre­vi­ous two months, ac­cord­ing to data from the De­part­ment of Statis­tics that was re­leased on Aug 5.</p>
    <p>Tak­ings at the till slid by 27.8 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, af­ter sink­ing by a record 52 per cent in May and by 40.3 per cent in April.</p>
    <p>Amid the dis­mal cli­mate, more re­tail­ers, in­clud­ing tra­di­tional ones, are en­gag­ing shop­pers on­line.</p>
    <p>In June, de­part­ment store BHG Sin­ga­pore launched an e-com­merce store – the first in its 26-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>More than 170 home-grown and in­ter­na­tional brands were put on­line, in­clud­ing those for cos­met­ics, home and liv­ing prod­ucts, elec­tron­ics, kitchen­ware and toys.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Robin­sons and</p>
    <p>Marks & Spencer, which have their own web­sites, went live with added store­fronts on e-com­merce plat­form Lazada in April.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers can browse au­then­ti­cated prod­ucts from each store’s as­sort­ment of brands via their LazMall stores.</p>
    <p>Touted as Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest re­tail event, the an­nual Great Sin­ga­pore Sale will also be a largely vir­tual event this year, for the first time since it be­gan 26 years ago.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port’s cam­paign runs for seven weeks, from now un­til Oct 11, on iShopChang­i. It will fea­ture weekly deals for nearly 9,000 tax- and duty-ab­sorbed prod­ucts, in­clud­ing elec­tron­ics and beauty items as well as wines and spir­its.</p>
