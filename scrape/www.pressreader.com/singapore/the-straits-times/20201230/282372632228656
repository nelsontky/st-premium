    <p>•</p>
    <p>LONDON Ever­ton yes­ter­day re­quested the Premier League pro­vide “full dis­clo­sure” re­gard­ing the Covid-19 out­break at Manch­ester City, which re­sulted in their Mon­day game be­ing post­poned.</p>
    <p>Just hours be­fore the match was due to kick off at Good­i­son Park, City said they had re­turned a num­ber of pos­i­tive tests in ad­di­tion to the four cases on Christ­mas Day that in­cluded striker Gabriel Je­sus and de­fender Kyle Walker.</p>
    <p>The Premier League then de­cided to post­pone the game – which had been set to be played in front of 2,000 fans – the sec­ond top-flight fix­ture to be pushed back this sea­son due to Covid-19 after New­cas­tle at Aston Villa ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Clubs will re­turn to be­ing tested twice a week.</p>
    <p>But the Tof­fees want more clar­ity on the late call, is­su­ing a state­ment that read: “Whilst Ever­ton will al­ways have pub­lic safety up­per­most, we will be re­quest­ing full dis­clo­sure of all the in­for­ma­tion that Manch­ester City pro­vided to the Premier League so the club can be clear on why this de­ci­sion was taken.”</p>
    <p>League rules state that a game can­not be post­poned un­less a team have fewer than 14 play­ers avail­able and while City did not state how many play­ers and staff caught the virus, The Sun said that “half of the team caught Covid”.</p>
    <p>The club con­ducted a fur­ther round of test­ing yes­ter­day to de­ter­mine the ex­tent of the clus­ter – the re­sults were not known by press time – while their train­ing ground has been closed in­def­i­nitely with deep clean­ing un­der way.</p>
    <p>The Villa-New­cas­tle game was de­layed to a later date as “a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure” after five Mag­pies play­ers were in­fected and ac­cord­ing to the Daily Mail, the same prin­ci­ple has been ap­plied.</p>
    <p>City are next sched­uled to visit Chelsea in the Premier League on Sun­day, but Blues man­ager Frank Lam­pard is brac­ing him­self for that game to be post­poned.</p>
    <p>“We’ll see what the po­si­tion is,” he said. “It’s a key time and a rough time, and we felt that com­ing with Tier 4 (re­stric­tions) com­ing in and the surge in Covid (in Bri­tain).</p>
    <p>“From our point of view, I will find out more over the next day or two to make sure it has to be safe for the two teams. If not, the (City) game won’t go ahead. I’m not sur­prised be­cause the way Covid is in the UK is dif­fi­cult for ev­ery­body and foot­ball isn’t very dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>City’s League Cup semi-final at Manch­ester United next week is also in dan­ger of be­ing re­ar­ranged. Ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish me­dia, the source of the out­break is be­lieved to be from an un­named London ho­tel where City stayed at be­fore last week’s League Cup quar­ter-final at Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>While Arse­nal have not re­ported any cases aris­ing from their clash with City, the Gun­ners re­vealed on Mon­day that Gabriel, who was al­ready self-iso­lat­ing after com­ing into con­tact with an in­di­vid­ual who had tested pos­i­tive, had come down with Covid and will miss their next two games at least.</p>
    <p>City’s clus­ter does not form part of the 18 pos­i­tive cases yes­ter­day re­vealed by the Premier League, the high­est num­ber in a week this term. The lat­est round of tests was con­ducted be­tween Dec 21 and 27 on 1,479 play­ers and staff and 131 in­di­vid­u­als have turned up pos­i­tive in 17 rounds of test­ing. The other cases were not iden­ti­fied but the Premier League said they will self-iso­late for 10 days.</p>
    <p>Southamp­ton re­vealed yes­ter­day ahead of their home clash against West Ham that their man­ager Ralph Hasen­huttl was self-iso­lat­ing fol­low­ing a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test in his house­hold.</p>
