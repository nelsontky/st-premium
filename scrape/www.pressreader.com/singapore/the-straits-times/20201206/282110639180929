    <p>There is a com­mon lament here that there is noth­ing to do in Sin­ga­pore. Sin­ga­pore­ans, ac­cus­tomed to the in­creas­ing ac­ces­si­bil­ity of des­ti­na­tions and the af­ford­abil­ity of bud­get air­fares, might have taken that old adage for granted un­til the pan­demic put paid to easy week­end get­aways. As travel re­stric­tions re­main, the De­cem­ber hol­i­days start, and the Sin­gapo-Re­dis­cov­ers travel vouch­ers scheme kicks in, Sin­ga­pore­ans are look­ing in­ward. The voucher scheme, which was launched last Tues­day, saw al­most 12,000 book­ings on the first day, to­talling some $1.86 mil­lion. Tiny Sin­ga­pore seems, iron­i­cally, an un­likely des­ti­na­tion for its denizens. But this dis­rup­tion to the travel in­dus­try might bear un­ex­pected div­i­dends if this early re­sponse is any in­di­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Travel-starved Sin­ga­pore­ans can now de­vote more time to plumb­ing their home coun­try’s rich her­itage and cul­ture. While tourists make a bee­line for Sin­ga­pore’s mul­ti­cul­tural at­trac­tions, lo­cals have a ten­dency to take them for granted. It is sur­pris­ing how many cen­tury-old in­sti­tu­tions and build­ings are still em­bed­ded in the so­cial fab­ric and land­scape of this lit­tle red dot if one knows where to look. Some are hid­den in plain sight. The Vic­to­ria per­form­ing arts com­plex’s clock tower, for in­stance, which is 115 years old and now open to tour groups. Oth­ers are tucked in ne­glected by­ways, such as the run­down build­ings in Jalan Am­pas where the leg­endary P. Ram­lee shot his box of­fice hits.</p>
    <p>The bi­cen­ten­nial com­mem­o­ra­tions last year cre­ated more aware­ness of Sin­ga­pore’s pre-colo­nial his­tory. This year is a chance to build on that bud­ding aware­ness for a richer un­der­stand­ing of Sin­ga­porean iden­tity. In­stead of re­gard­ing the travel re­stric­tions as a lim­i­ta­tion, why not see it as lib­er­a­tion. It is a chance for Sin­ga­pore­ans to ex­plore their home more deeply and truly. What they find might sur­prise and de­light them.</p>
