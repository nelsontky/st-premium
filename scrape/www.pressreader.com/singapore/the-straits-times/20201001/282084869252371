    <p>Parked cars will make way for grow­ing veg­eta­bles as ten­ders were awarded for ur­ban farm­ing at nine carpark rooftops by the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sites, which are rooftops of Hous­ing Board (HDB) multi-storey carparks, com­prise five sin­gle sites and two clus­ters of two sites each.</p>
    <p>They were awarded to six ten­der­ers. Each site is up for ten­der for a term of up to three years.</p>
    <p>The high­est ten­der of $90,000 for an­nual rent was awarded to IT Meng Land­scape and Con­struc­tion, for a clus­ter site in Jurong West, with one site span­ning a to­tal area of 3,311 sq m – three-fifths of a foot­ball field – and the other at 2,974 sq m.</p>
    <p>Other carpark lo­ca­tions in­cluded Choa Chu Kang, Tampines,</p>
    <p>Hougang, Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Sem­bawang.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Kok Thai, chief ex­ec­u­tive of SFA, said: “The suc­cess­ful ten­der­ers’ pro­pos­als in­cluded hy­dro­ponic and ver­ti­cal farm­ing sys­tems with a va­ri­ety of in­no­va­tive features such as IoT (In­ter­net of Things), blockchain tech­nol­ogy and au­to­mated cli­mate con­trol.</p>
    <p>“With th­ese farm­ing sys­tems, the sites have the po­ten­tial to col­lec­tively pro­duce around 1,600 tonnes of veg­eta­bles an­nu­ally.”</p>
    <p>He hoped that the trans­for­ma­tion of the rooftops to veg­etable farms will con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore’s “30 by 30 goal” – to pro­duce 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030.</p>
    <p>Ms Phoebe Xie, 30, direc­tor and co-founder of lo­cal ur­ban tech­nol­ogy com­pany AbyFarm, was one of the six that suc­cess­fully ten­dered for the carpark rooftop spa­ces.</p>
    <p>With the 3,171 sq m site in Ang Mo Kio, it hopes to be­gin con­struc­tion of the farm in the next few months, and to have its launch date within the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>“The farm will be en­tirely au­to­mated, with real-time tech­nol­ogy used to con­trol the en­vi­ron­ment within the green­house, and to con­sis­tently mon­i­tor the crops and iden­tify early the pos­si­bil­ity of bad crops, which will en­sure its qual­ity,” she said.</p>
    <p>With an ex­pected yield of 200 tonnes of fruits and veg­eta­bles each year, the com­pany is look­ing to har­vest lo­cal favourites, such as kang kong and kai lan as well as other types of pro­duce like mush­rooms, figs and Ja­panese melon.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently a to­tal of four SFA-li­censed rooftop farms in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing a pilot ur­ban farm launched last year at a multi-storey carpark in Ang Mo Kio.</p>
    <p>The ten­der for the nine sites, which was launched on May 12, closed on June 16. The sites were awarded us­ing the price-qual­ity ten­der method, where both the bid price and the qual­ity at­tributes, such as pro­duc­tion out­put, and de­sign and site lay­out, were fac­tored into the ten­der eval­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the sites were as­sessed for their suit­abil­ity for ur­ban farm­ing, such as avail­abil­ity of elec­tric­ity, wa­ter to sup­port such farm­ing, as well as cur­rent or fu­ture de­vel­op­ments of HDB blocks.</p>
    <p>HDB has stud­ied the park­ing de­mand in th­ese ar­eas and as­cer­tained that res­i­dents’ park­ing needs would not be com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>SFA said it will be work­ing with HDB to ten­der out more carpark rooftop sites for ur­ban farm­ing in the fourth quar­ter of the year.</p>
