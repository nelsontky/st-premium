    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain is con­sid­er­ing pulling its j udges out of Hong Kong’s high­est court, For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab has said, in its lat­est re­sponse to what it con­sid­ers China’s breaches of its in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions in the ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, which ruled Hong Kong for more than 150 years un­til it handed the city back to China in 1997, said a new se­cu­rity law im­posed on the ter­ri­tory by Bei­jing just be­fore mid­night on June 30 was a breach of the 1984 Si­noBri­tish Joint Dec­la­ra­tion that paved the way for the han­dover.</p>
    <p>Lon­don has also ob­jected to new rules im­posed by the main­land au­thor­i­ties to dis­qual­ify elected leg­is­la­tors in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“This has been, and con­tin­ues to be, the most con­cern­ing pe­riod in Hong Kong’s post-han­dover his­tory,” Mr Raab wrote in his fore­word to the lat­est in a reg­u­lar se­ries of six-monthly re­ports on Hong Kong on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment hit back at what it called “sweep­ing at­tacks and ground­less ac­cu­sa­tions” in the re­port, adding that they were “ir­re­spon­si­ble re­marks”.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry’s com­mis­sion in Hong Kong also ex­pressed “strong in­dig­na­tion” at the re­port, ac­cord­ing to the of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency.</p>
    <p>“Wake up and stop the old colo­nial dream of in­ter­fer­ing in Hong Kong’s af­fairs,” it quoted a spokesman as say­ing.</p>
    <p>In the fore­word, Mr Raab said he had be­gun con­sult­ing on what to do about Bri­tish judges who now sit on Hong Kong’s top court.</p>
    <p>“I have be­gun con­sul­ta­tions with Lord Reed, pres­i­dent of the United King­dom Supreme Court, con­cern­ing when to re­view whether it con­tin­ues to be ap­pro­pri­ate for Bri­tish judges to sit as non-per­ma­nent judges on the Hong Kong Court of Fi­nal Ap­peal,” said Mr Raab.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has al­ready an­nounced new im­mi­gra­tion rules mak­ing it eas­ier for peo­ple from Hong Kong to live in the UK, sus­pended its ex­tra­di­tion treaty with Hong Kong and ex­tended its China arms em­bargo to in­clude Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate de­vel­op­ment, a Hong Kong man named Ma Chun Man, 30, was dragged from a court shout­ing democ­racy slo­gans and re­manded into cus­tody yes­ter­day af­ter be­com­ing the third per­son to be charged un­der a sweep­ing new na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
