    <p>Although Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to re­duce new in­fec­tion cases to zero or just a few in the past few weeks, this does not mean that the coun­try has suc­cess­fully elim­i­nated Covid-19 from the com­mu­nity, ex­perts cau­tioned. The Repub­lic will not be safe un­til the world is safe, as the pres­ence of asymp­to­matic pa­tients could still lead to com­mu­nity spread, they warned.</p>
    <p>While the risk of con­tract­ing Covid-19 dur­ing a flight has been re­duced with mea­sures such as air fil­ter­ing in place, pas­sen­gers should con­tinue to take pre­cau­tions while on board.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases ex­perts urged cau­tion when fly­ing, say­ing that the risk of get­ting in­fected from some­body else on board can­not be elim­i­nated com­pletely.</p>
    <p>Their com­ments come after in­dus­try group In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata) re­leased find­ings this month stat­ing that the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion on board planes ap­pears to be “very low”, and that cur­rent fig­ures “are ex­tremely re­as­sur­ing”.</p>
    <p>Air­plane man­u­fac­tur­ers Air­bus, Boe­ing and Em­braer had backed the find­ings with their own stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, who noted that there have been doc­u­mented in­stances of trans­mis­sions dur­ing flights, said: “Trav­ellers should pay heed that it is en­tirely pos­si­ble to be in­fected, and they should take ev­ery pre­cau­tion to pro­tect them­selves should they be trav­el­ling on a plane.”</p>
    <p>Wear­ing face masks prop­erly and main­tain­ing good hy­giene will greatly re­duce the risk, he said.</p>
    <p>“The only con­cern will be when pas­sen­gers re­move their masks dur­ing meal times, but the risk is also re­duced com­pared with nor­mal meals at home or in restau­rants since pas­sen­gers typ­i­cally are fac­ing for­ward and not each other.”</p>
    <p>Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hos­pi­tal, said that one po­ten­tial source of risk could be when pas­sen­gers use the air­plane toi­lets.</p>
    <p>To man­age this risk, pas­sen­gers can clean sur­faces in­side the toi­let be­fore touch­ing them, and also wash their hands thor­oughly after.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers can also sit far­ther away from the aisle when pos­si­ble to re­duce the risk of com­ing into di­rect con­tact with an in­fected per­son, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong Sin Yew of the In­fec­tious Dis­ease Spe­cial­ists Group said that cur­rent data does in­di­cate a low risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion when the use of a mask is man­dated, re­fer­ring to a study on the risk of in­flight trans­mis­sion that was pub­lished in the Jour­nal of Travel Medicine last month.</p>
    <p>The study by Dr David Freed­man, a United States in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist, and Dr An­nelies WilderSmit­h of the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine found that com­pul­sory face cov­er­ings on flights were as­so­ci­ated with lower trans­mis­sion risks.</p>
    <p>It also con­cluded that the ab­sence of large num­bers of con­firmed and pub­lished in-flight trans­mis­sions of Covid-19 is en­cour­ag­ing but is not de­fin­i­tive ev­i­dence that plane pas­sen­gers are safe.</p>
    <p>Iata had drawn upon the re­search to sug­gest that it is safe to fly, and also sug­gested a low risk of trans­mis­sion based on fig­ures cen­tred on the doc­u­ment­ing of just 44 iden­ti­fied po­ten­tial cases among 1.2 bil­lion trav­ellers this year.</p>
    <p>But Dr Freed­man told news agency Reuters that Iata’s cal­cu­la­tion “was bad maths” as most of the pas­sen­gers were not tested. The ab­sence of ev­i­dence is not ev­i­dence of ab­sence, he added.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has said that the lack of ex­ten­sive doc­u­men­ta­tion of in-flight trans­mis­sion does not mean that it does not hap­pen, although it noted that the risk ap­pears to be very low.</p>
    <p>When asked about cases of in­flight trans­mis­sion that oc­curred on its planes, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines said it was un­able to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion about it.</p>
    <p>Bud­get car­rier Jet­star Asia said there have been no re­ported cases of pas­sen­gers or crew be­ing in­fected on board its flights.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo told ST: “It is im­por­tant that we in­ter­pret the present data care­fully.</p>
    <p>“Given that many flights op­er­at­ing dur­ing this pe­riod have kept to some de­gree of so­cial dis­tanc­ing be­tween pas­sen­gers, for ex­am­ple, by keep­ing the mid­dle seats empty, the data that has been col­lated to date may not ad­e­quately re­flect trans­mis­sion risk when air­lines start to re­sume nor­mal op­er­a­tions and fill all pos­si­ble seats.”</p>
    <p>Ex­perts agreed that mov­ing for­ward, pre-flight test­ing for Covid-19 is key in re­duc­ing the chances of an in­fected per­son get­ting on board.</p>
    <p>Dr Leong said that even if anti­gen test­ing – which de­liv­ers faster re­sults but is less ac­cu­rate than the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests – is used to screen pas­sen­gers, it can help to de­tect the bulk of those in­fected.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong said: “Pre-de­par­ture test­ing for Covid-19 is very im­por­tant in re­duc­ing trans­mis­sion, and com­pul­sory test­ing should be se­ri­ously con­sid­ered for all flights.”</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned that the safe re­sump­tion of air travel on a large scale is “nowhere near”, with sev­eral hun­dreds of thou­sands of cases oc­cur­ring daily.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said: “I an­tic­i­pate that air travel can re­sume in an al­most un­re­stricted man­ner in the form of travel bub­bles be­tween cities that are able to keep Covid-19 at bay.</p>
    <p>“For other cities that are strug­gling to keep the coron­avirus un­der con­trol, it is un­likely that large-scale air travel can re­sume, sim­ply be­cause the de­mand will not be there.”</p>
