    <p>Book­ing plat­forms are work­ing closely with Sen­tosa at­trac­tions to put in place no­tices to re­mind cus­tomers, be­fore they buy tick­ets, to book a time slot.</p>
    <p>This comes as many have flocked to the is­land dur­ing the De­cem­ber school hol­i­days and could not use their tick­ets on fully booked at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>While the change will hap­pen af­ter the usual rush dur­ing the yearend school hol­i­days, it could still help other vis­i­tors to Sen­tosa, es­pe­cially dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods like the week­ends, as well as other fes­tive pe­ri­ods and school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The book­ing sit­u­a­tion could also be ex­ac­er­bated partly by peo­ple still re­deem­ing their Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers tourism vouch­ers for at­trac­tion tick­ets.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous at­trac­tions said that time slots were in­tro­duced to help them re­duce over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>When The Sun­day Times vis­ited Sen­tosa last Mon­day morning – a week be­fore school starts – at­trac­tions in­clud­ing GoGreen Seg­way Eco Ad­ven­ture, iFly Sin­ga­pore and Trick Eye Mu­seum were fully booked for the day.</p>
    <p>Some at­trac­tions were also booked out for the first week of Jan­uary, in­clud­ing the SEA Aquar­ium and Head­Rock VR.</p>
    <p>A queue of more than 300 peo­ple was seen out­side Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore at 2.30pm last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Some vis­i­tors were de­nied en­try be­cause they had showed up with­out book­ing a time slot.</p>
    <p>Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion said that many guests had “taken the op­por­tu­nity to re­deem their Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers for ex­pe­ri­ences i n Sen­tosa dur­ing this year-end fes­tive pe­riod and we thank them for their strong sup­port”.</p>
    <p>To visit Sen­tosa at­trac­tions, peo­ple can pur­chase tick­ets ei­ther di­rectly from the at­trac­tions’ web­sites or through book­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Those us­ing their Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers can also pur­chase tick­ets for the at­trac­tions via the five au­tho­rised book­ing plat­forms: Changi Rec­om­mends, Glob­alTix, Trav­eloka, Trip.com and Klook.</p>
    <p>The voucher scheme started last month and can be re­deemed un­til the end of June.</p>
    <p>There is also the Sen­tosa Fun Pass which gives vis­i­tors a cer­tain num­ber of to­kens which they can use at se­lected Sen­tosa at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is valid for only two days, once cus­tomers ex­change their con­fir­ma­tion re­ceipt for the pass at Sen­tosa tick­et­ing coun­ters.</p>
    <p>This means the passes bought could be wasted if cus­tomers can­not use them quickly enough when at­trac­tions are fully booked.</p>
    <p>Get­ting a re­fund is also tricky and usu­ally not pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For some peo­ple, it is also a mat­ter of time wasted and dif­fi­culty find­ing the time for another trip to Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>Con­sul­tant Eileen Chua, 45, had pur­chased five passes for her fam­ily of five af­ter she saw a pro­mo­tion. When she went down to Sen­tosa on Dec 21 morning, she de­cided not to use the passes af­ter she was told by at­trac­tion op­er­a­tors that they were sold out for the day.</p>
    <p>“We have such a short time to use the passes and our kids will be back in school soon. By that time, we can go only on the week­ends, but even more at­trac­tions may be sold out,” she said.</p>
    <p>While signs in­di­cat­ing that at­trac­tions were fully booked were placed at some Sen­tosa at­trac­tions, there is no cen­tralised plat­form that peo­ple could visit to check the avail­abil­ity of time slots.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral vis­i­tors also did not re­alise there was a need to book time slots as they thought the process was com­pleted af­ter they got con­fir­ma­tion for buy­ing their tick­ets.</p>
    <p>To com­pli­cate mat­ters, at­trac­tions can have dif­fer­ent time slots avail­able on dif­fer­ent book­ing plat­forms that do not syn­chro­nise with one another.</p>
    <p>Some plat­forms have started to no­tify cus­tomers about the need to book time slots for at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>Early last month, book­ing plat­form Klook re­quired cus­tomers to check a box when mak­ing pay­ment for tick­ets to ac­knowl­edge that they are aware of the need to book a time slot.</p>
    <p>Time slots are booked separately and may be done through e-mail for some at­trac­tions or by vis­it­ing the at­trac­tion’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Ms Sarah Wan, South-east Asia mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor at Klook, said the new fea­ture will be pro­gres­sively rolled out for all Sen­tosa Fun Pass ac­tiv­i­ties “in due course”.</p>
    <p>Book­ing plat­form Trav­eloka also said last Wed­nes­day that it will be adding ad­di­tional in­for­ma­tion on the re­quire­ment for time slot reser­va­tions for cus­tomers book­ing the Sen­tosa Fun Pass via its web­site.</p>
    <p>Sky­line Luge Sen­tosa gen­eral man­ager Dean John­son said the at­trac­tion is in the process of mak­ing reser­va­tions manda­tory for all guests.</p>
    <p>The Trick Eye Mu­seum is also look­ing into a new on­line tick­et­ing sys­tem which al­lows cus­tomers to make reser­va­tions when they pur­chase tick­ets.</p>
