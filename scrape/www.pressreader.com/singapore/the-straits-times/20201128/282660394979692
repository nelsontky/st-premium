    <p>RACE 1 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>9 Su­per Ax­iom has shown plenty of abil­ity in his tri­als. He can make his pres­ence felt on de­but.</p>
    <p>8 Ro­man­tic Trove also caught the eye at the tri­als and de­serves for­give­ness for his de­but ninth.</p>
    <p>2 Amaz­ing Rocky’s de­but third was im­pres­sive. He can be com­pet­i­tive if he repli­cates that run.</p>
    <p>7 Rhap­sody is limited but is a win­ner al­ready. Do not dis­count.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>12 Blaz­ing Part­ners’ best run this sea­son came over this course and dis­tance. He looks ready to win.</p>
    <p>3 Nurem­berg can go for­ward from the good gate and stick on for some prize money.</p>
    <p>1 Destin has the big weight but steps down to Class 5. Cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton will be aboard. 10 Ado­nis has ap­pren­tice Jerry Chau’s 7lb (3.2kg) claim and the ad­van­tage of an in­side gate.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>6 Res­o­lute is a smart, lightly raced dirt win­ner this term. With Gate 1, he can snag an­other.</p>
    <p>3 Vic­tory In Hand is only a small horse but he seems to have plenty of abil­ity.</p>
    <p>4 Jade Phoenix is worth in­clud­ing as his tri­als on the dirt have been sound.</p>
    <p>11 Star Su­pe­rior is next best with no weight to carry.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>2 Czar­son is a three-time run­nerup. This is his race to lose with Pur­ton tak­ing over rid­ing du­ties.</p>
    <p>8 Gun­nar led all the way to an easy 41/ 4- length vic­tory last start. He will try to do the same.</p>
    <p>1 Utopia Life, a last-start Class 3</p>
    <p>win­ner, can roll for­ward from the good draw. Chance.</p>
    <p>7 All For South has done well in both of his starts. He bears close watch­ing.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>13 Right­eous Win can pinch this by lead­ing with no weight on his back from the in­side draw.</p>
    <p>10 Master Hero im­pressed with a de­but sec­ond a fort­night ago. Joao Mor­eira has taken over the ride.</p>
    <p>2 Glo­ri­ous Lover has the abil­ity. It is just a mat­ter of putting it to­gether.</p>
    <p>7 Lead­ing For­tune can be fight­ing for the prize money from the good draw and his solid form.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>10 Win­ning Steed has found his</p>
    <p>groove, fol­low­ing a close-up fifth last time. He is a top chance.</p>
    <p>2 Kasi Farasi can roll for­ward from the good draw with the ap­pren­tice’s weight re­lief.</p>
    <p>7 Mer­cu­rial mer­its con­sid­er­a­tion. He nar­rowly missed last start.</p>
    <p>8 Ro­bot War­rior is third-up and looks ready to peak.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>1 Bud­dies will roll for­ward from Gate 1 and try to make all the run­ning, like he did last start in the Pana­sonic Cup. Chau’s 7lb claim will come in handy.</p>
    <p>11 Lucky Ex­press ran on well for sec­ond in the Pana­sonic Cup. He will rel­ish the step-up to 1,600m.</p>
    <p>12 Sky Darci is look­ing for his third con­sec­u­tive win. He is on the up.</p>
    <p>10 Gen­eral’s De­light is bet­ter than his re­cent record sug­gests. He can fig­ure.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>4 Big For­tune gets a handy weight re­lief and Gate 5, which should give him ev­ery op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>1 Lock­heed fi­nally got off the mark at his 24th at­tempt last start. He has come right and can do it again. 11 Bel­uga is a two-time win­ner from four starts. The only con­cern is the wide gate.</p>
    <p>10 Juneau Park is a two-time win­ner from seven starts. The draw suits.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>14 Che­va­lier Prince re­turned in ex­cel­lent or­der first-up with a nar­row de­feat over the course and dis­tance. He should be fit­ter.</p>
    <p>2 Per­fect To Great grabbed sec­ond last time. He is ca­pa­ble of go­ing one bet­ter.</p>
    <p>1 Mr Al­dan’s last run on the dirt was too bad to be true. He is bet­ter than that.</p>
    <p>7 Awe is able and has had the ben­e­fit of two runs.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>6 Healthy Happy looks to have come on from his de­but win. He just needs to han­dle the ex­tra 200m.</p>
    <p>3 Shadow Hero is a dual Aus­tralian Group 1 win­ner who is mak­ing his long-awaited de­but.</p>
    <p>12 Wa­ter Diviner is a five-time win­ner. He needs a lot to go his way but is proven in this grade.</p>
    <p>7 Beauty Rush led through­out last time. He has drawn Gate 1 in his bid for back-to-back wins.</p>
