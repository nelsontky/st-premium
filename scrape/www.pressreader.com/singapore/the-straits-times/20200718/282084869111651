    <p>The Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties have taken DNA sam­ples from fam­ily mem­bers of a miss­ing Sin­ga­porean, af­ter hu­man re­mains were found near where the stu­dent was swept into the ocean.</p>
    <p>The DNA will help in iden­ti­fy­ing the re­mains, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing lo­cal po­lice, Aus­tralia’s on­line news out­let WA­to­day yes­ter­day re­ported that the re­mains were found on the shore near Wyadup Rocks on Thurs­day at about 11.20am. They were iden­ti­fied ten­ta­tively as those of Mr Goh Heng Yi.</p>
    <p>Wyadup Rocks is not far from In­jidup Na­ture Spa – a nat­u­ral rock for­ma­tion on In­jidup Beach – where Mr Goh was last seen. The 23-year-old stu­dent was swept into the sea by a wave on June 29.</p>
    <p>“The man was stand­ing on rocks within me­tres of the ocean when a large wave broke over the rocks, knock­ing him into the ocean,” a po­lice spokesman said on June 30.</p>
    <p>A five-day-long search ef­fort was mounted, but was sus­pended by the West Aus­tralian po­lice on July 3, pend­ing any new in­for­ma­tion be­ing re­ceived.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh’s fa­ther told The Straits Times on July 7 that the fam­ily was fly­ing to Perth on that day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s MFA, which in­formed Mr Goh’s fa­ther of the in­ci­dent on the day it oc­curred, sought per­mis­sion from Can­berra for the fam­ily to travel to Western Aus­tralia amid bor­der en­try curbs due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Per­mis­sion was granted on July 1, but the fam­ily did not leave on the first avail­able flight from Sin­ga­pore to Perth as they would have to un­dergo 14 days of quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“Our fam­ily is al­ready very dis­traught and be­ing locked up for 14 days will cause us a lot of emo­tional dis­tress,” said Mr Goh, a 64-year-old re­tiree, on July 4.</p>
    <p>An ap­peal for the fam­ily to be ex­empted from the quar­an­tine upon ar­rival in Aus­tralia on com­pas­sion­ate grounds was not ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily has been in quar­an­tine since ar­riv­ing in Perth.</p>
    <p>The el­der Mr Goh said he last ex­changed mes­sages with his son the night be­fore the tragedy, and that the fam­ily kept in touch with him fre­quently through mes­sages and video calls af­ter he be­gan pur­su­ing his master’s de­gree in eco­nom­ics at the Univer­sity of Western Aus­tralia in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>He said the tragedy might not have oc­curred if not for bor­der clo­sures due to the pan­demic, as his son was on a term break and would have re­turned to Sin­ga­pore to spend time with the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The younger Mr Goh was vis­it­ing In­jidup Beach, which is about 260km south of Perth, with five friends when he was swept away.</p>
    <p>An MFA con­sular of­fi­cer is in Perth to help the fam­ily and to li­aise with the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
