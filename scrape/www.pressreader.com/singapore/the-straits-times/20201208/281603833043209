    <p>A $12 mil­lion pro­gramme was launched yes­ter­day to boost Sin­ga­pore’s blockchain ecosys­tem and sup­port the de­vel­op­ment, com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion and adop­tion of blockchain tech­nol­ogy for real-world uses.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Blockchain In­no­va­tion Pro­gramme will en­gage close to 75 com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions, large en­ter­prises and info-com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, to de­vise 17 blockchain-re­lated projects within the next three years in sec­tors such as trade and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme seeks to trans­late re­search into real-world needs, en­able the adop­tion of blockchain in en­vi­ron­ments with high trans­ac­tion rates, and grow­ing the blockchain tech tal­ent pool.</p>
    <p>It is a joint ef­fort by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG), the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) and the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF), and is funded by the NRF.</p>
    <p>ESG chair­man Peter Ong said: “Covid-19 em­pha­sised the need for trusted and re­li­able business sys­tems in the new dig­i­tal world.”</p>
    <p>Blockchain tech­nol­ogy helps to “embed trust in ap­pli­ca­tions” span­ning lo­gis­tics and sup­ply chains, trade fi­nanc­ing, and dig­i­tal iden­ti­ties and cre­den­tials, he noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Lew Chuen Hong, chief executive of IMDA, said the pro­gramme aims to en­cour­age blockchain adop­tion in more in­dus­tries beyond fi­nance, and in­cludes scal­ing up in­dus­try man­power and know-how.</p>
    <p>This comes as a re­port re­leased yes­ter­day noted that Sin­ga­pore is a key hub for blockchain re­search and com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has pro­duced the high­est num­ber of blockchain-re­lated re­search pub­li­ca­tions in South-east Asia, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Blockchain Ecosys­tem Re­port 2020.</p>
    <p>The re­port, re­leased at the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val and Sin­ga­pore Week of In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy, showed the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the ap­pli­ca­tion of blockchain tech­nol­ogy, which is be­ing used to ver­ify health cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>The re­port was co-pre­sented by blockchain in­dus­try part­ners OpenNodes, Te­masek, IBM, PwC Sin­ga­pore, EY and SGTech, and sup­ported by IMDA and the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has pro­duced 162 blockchain-re­lated pub­li­ca­tions over the last 15 years, and this num­ber is about 2.25 per cent of all re­search pub­li­ca­tions and 15th in the world.</p>
    <p>ESG, IMDA and NRF also said yes­ter­day that small and medium-sized en­ter­prises and start-ups have sub­mit­ted more than 300 pro­pos­als across 16 Na­tional In­no­va­tion Chal­lenges prob­lem state­ments since July this year, demon­strat­ing their strong in­ter­est in solv­ing th­ese is­sues and en­abling dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional In­no­va­tion Chal­lenges were an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in May and aim to ac­cel­er­ate in­no­va­tion ef­forts and help en­ter­prises de­velop so­lu­tions to over­come chal­lenges in the post-Covid-19 world. Some $40 mil­lion has been set aside for the initiative.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral projects are on track for in­dus­try adop­tion next year, and four pro­to­typ­ing projects from the first batch of chal­lenges launched in July are be­ing tested.</p>
