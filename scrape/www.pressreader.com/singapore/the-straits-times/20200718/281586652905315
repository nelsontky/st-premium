    <p>Six-year-old Bridger Walker, who was mauled af­ter shield­ing his four-year-old sis­ter from a charg­ing dog ear­lier this month, has caught the at­ten­tion of celebri­ties, in­clud­ing Cap­tain Amer­ica ac­tor Chris Evans. He sent Bridger and his fam­ily a video mes­sage, and promised to send Bridger an au­then­tic Cap­tain Amer­ica shield “be­cause, pal, you de­serve it”.</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Six-year-old Bridger Walker, who was mauled af­ter shield­ing his four-year-old sis­ter from a charg­ing dog ear­lier this month, has caught the at­ten­tion of celebri­ties, in­clud­ing Cap­tain Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Three days af­ter the in­ci­dent on July 9, the boy’s aunt Ni­cole Walker took to In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>She tagged sev­eral Avengers stars and wrote: “I’m reach­ing out to the Avengers and other he­roes so that they can learn about this lat­est ad­di­tion to their ranks.”</p>
    <p>The post quickly went vi­ral and ac­tor Chris Evans, who plays Cap­tain Amer­ica i n the Marvel fran­chise, promptly sent Bridger and his fam­ily a video mes­sage: “I’m sure you heard a lot of this over the past cou­ple of days, but let me be the next one to tell you, pal, you’re a hero.”</p>
    <p>Bridger, who is from Wy­oming, watched the clip dressed in a Cap­tain Amer­ica out­fit.</p>
    <p>Evans added: “What you did was so brave. So selfless. Your sis­ter is so lucky to have you as a big brother. Your par­ents must be so proud of you.”</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old ac­tor then promised to send Bridger an au­then­tic Cap­tain Amer­ica shield “be­cause, pal, you de­serve it”.</p>
    <p>In her post, Walker said that af­ter the at­tack, Bridger, who re­quired about 90 stitches af­ter the dog bit his face and head, had told his fam­ily: “If some­one had to die, I thought it should be me.”</p>
    <p>Evans had words of en­cour­age­ment for the boy: “Keep be­ing the man you are. We need peo­ple like you. Hang in there, I know re­cov­ery might be tough, but based on what I’ve seen, I don’t think there’s much that can slow you down.”</p>
    <p>His Avengers co-stars also reached out, in­clud­ing Tom Hol­land, who plays Spi­der-Man, and Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk. Avengers di­rec­tors An­thony and Joseph Russo also got in touch.</p>
    <p>Other celebri­ties such as Hugh Jack­man, Zachary Levi, Anne Hath­away and Rob­bie Amell also praised Bridger’s hero­ism.</p>
