    <p>• Ful­ham striker Alek­san­dar Mitro­vic missed a penalty and gave away a spot-kick as Sh­effield United res­cued a 1-1 draw in a bat­tle of the Pre­mier League strug­glers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mitro­vic fired over with his sec­ond-half penalty when the score was 0-0 at Bra­mall Lane.</p>
    <p>Ade­mola Look­man put Ful­ham ahead with 13 min­utes left, but Mitro­vic’s foul on Jack Robin­son con­ceded a late penalty that Billy Sharp con­verted.</p>
    <p>The Ser­bia in­ter­na­tional is the first player to com­mit the un­wanted penalty dou­ble in the same top-flight game since Mikel Arteta for Arse­nal against Ful­ham in 2012.</p>
    <p>As if that was not enough frus­tra­tion for Cot­tagers boss Scott Parker to en­dure, he also had to watch Mitro­vic miss two golden chances in stop­page time.</p>
    <p>But he was pleased with his side’s “ex­cep­tional” per­for­mance in the sec­ond half. “The sec­ond half, I saw a dy­namic team, a team that could cre­ate chances and I was pleased over­all in that sense,” Parker said af­ter Ful­ham’s first draw in 15 Pre­mier League matches un­der him.</p>
    <p>“There is still plenty of learn­ing and plenty of im­prove­ment to do... The team is go­ing in the right di­rec­tion, not just today.”</p>
    <p>Ful­ham at least moved off the bot­tom of the ta­ble af­ter tak­ing their first point at the fifth at­tempt, fol­low­ing last sea­son’s pro­mo­tion from the Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The Blades also avoided de­feat for the first time in five games this sea­son. Man­ager Chris Wilder said: “We were a lit­tle bit more like our old selves in the first half... (but) not like our old selves in the sec­ond half. It is a bit of a bat­tle at the mo­ment, a bit of a grind, but de­lighted to get some­thing out of the game.”</p>
    <p>Crys­tal Palace were also awarded a penalty against Brighton yes­ter­day. The hosts took the lead in the 19th minute through Wil­fried Zaha af­ter Michy Bat­shuayi was con­tro­ver­sially ad­judged to have been pulled in the box, but Alexis Mac Al­lis­ter equalised in added time. Seag­ulls de­fender Lewis Dunk was sent off late on.</p>
