    <p>•</p>
    <p>MOSCOW A new draft law giv­ing im­mu­nity to for­mer pres­i­dents and their fam­i­lies has rekin­dled spec­u­la­tion about Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s fu­ture, months af­ter he pushed through con­sti­tu­tional changes that could al­low him to stay in of­fice un­til 2036.</p>
    <p>Some around the Krem­lin say the Bill has spurred quiet dis­cus­sion of the pos­si­bil­ity that Mr Putin might not linger nearly that long.</p>
    <p>Back­ers of the draft, which is ex­pected to be­come law within days, say it is just part of the Rus­sian leader’s ef­fort to build a less per­son­alised sys­tem to suc­ceed him, when­ever he de­cides it is time to step down.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin, whose 21-year rule al­ready makes him Rus­sia’s longest­serv­ing leader since Soviet dic­ta­tor Josef Stalin, has shown no sign that he is go­ing any­where.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent de­fended the re­moval of term lim­its for him­self at a 41/ hour an­nual press con­fer­ence last Thurs­day, look­ing vig­or­ous and con­fi­dent through­out.</p>
    <p>“The sta­ble de­vel­op­ment of the na­tion is worth a lot,” Mr Putin said, adding that he had not de­cided yet whether to run again in the next pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in 2024.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­lar re­vival of spec­u­la­tion about the 68-year-old leader’s fu­ture high­lights how cen­tral Mr Putin re­mains to the Rus­sian state and the chal­lenge he faces in try­ing to en­gi­neer a tran­si­tion to a new pres­i­dent in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The con­sti­tu­tional changes ap­proved in a ref­er­en­dum in July ex­empted him from term lim­its that would have made his cur­rent one his last.</p>
    <p>But some around the Krem­lin are spec­u­lat­ing that Mr Putin might try to en­gi­neer a move to a new post that would al­low him to re­tain the reins of power with­out the day-to-day bur­den of the pres­i­dency, ac­cord­ing to three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>“Putin’s main goal is not to turn into a lame-duck leader, if he were to give up the pres­i­dency early, he’d avoid that sce­nario,” said so­ci­ol­o­gist Olga Krysh­tanovskaya of the State Univer­sity of Man­age­ment, who has stud­ied Rus­sia’s elite for the last three decades.</p>
    <p>The idea that the Krem­lin boss might re­sign un­ex­pect­edly has sur­faced sev­eral times in the past, only to be proven wrong.</p>
    <p>“The elite are get­ting overly ner­vous, but they’re sup­posed to worry,” said Mr Kon­stantin Kostin, a for­mer Krem­lin of­fi­cial who now heads a think-tank that works with the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He said he is con­fi­dent that Mr Putin has no plans to step down in the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“We have a mono­cen­tric sys­tem in which a huge amount de­pends on who has the top post.”</p>
    <p>Mr Putin has shown signs of grow­ing fa­tigue with his pres­i­den­tial du­ties af­ter two decades at the helm, said Mr Gleb Pavlovsky, a for­mer Krem­lin ad­viser.</p>
    <p>“The guar­an­tee for him won’t be the law but the tra­di­tion and the ab­sence of a counter-elite sce­nario,” says an­a­lyst Mikhail Vino­gradov.</p>
    <p>“The elite in Rus­sia un­der­stands that to throw the pre­vi­ous leader un­der the bus won’t ben­e­fit any­one.”</p>
