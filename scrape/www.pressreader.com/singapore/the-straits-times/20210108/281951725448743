    <p>Much re­lated, the Repub­li­can Party will go where it thinks the votes are, but that’s an on­go­ing cal­cu­la­tion that Demo­cratic be­hav­iour in of­fice will in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>If the Demo­cratic brain trust con­tin­ues to pri­ori­tise fight­ing rar­efied cul­ture war bat­tles over, say, “trans­gen­der is­sues” in­volv­ing mi­nus­cule por­tions of the pop­u­la­tion while or­di­nary peo­ple strug­gle to put food on the ta­ble or pay for their med­i­ca­tions, votes will flow to pop­ulists left and right.</p>
    <p>If it con­tin­ues to coun­te­nance use of the “D” word – “de­plorables” – to stig­ma­tise any dis­sent from “woke” views based in myths of “foun­da­tional racism”, votes will cas­cade in fu­ries away from the Democrats. As they should, be­cause those views are wrong.</p>
    <p>If soon-to-be Pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den is wise, he will fol­low his in­stincts to chal­lenge Repub­li­cans to tri­an­gu­late, Bill Clin­ton-style, to solve press­ing na­tional prob­lems.</p>
    <p>If they baulk, they will be blamed for ob­struc­tion. If they buy in, Mr Bi­den will ben­e­fit but they will forge a way to bring their party back to its senses. Those chances will rise if Mr Bi­den can keep his party’s left wing from pro­vok­ing Repub­li­cans to arc po­lit­i­cally to­wards their pop­ulist sup­port off “woke” red-meat of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>As things stand, de­pend­ing on di­verse lo­cal po­lit­i­cal land­scapes, some Repub­li­cans think the so­lu­tion to their trou­bles is “more Trump”, in other words, more pop­ulist pan­der­ing. Oth­ers, es­pe­cially in blue or bluish states, hope to in­sin­u­ate into be­ing a post-elec­tion GOP iden­tity they can live and get elected with that bears lit­tle re­la­tion to what the Repub­li­can Party ac­tu­ally is right now.</p>
    <p>How will they ex­plain their past ob­se­quious and eva­sive be­hav­iour? Easy: They will say it never hap­pened. The Sovi­ets used to air­brush pho­to­graphs. Some Repub­li­cans in this time of re­al­ity cy­ber-warp­ing will seek to air­brush away en­tire years, and in the cur­rent Amer­i­can “bread and cir­cus” spec­ta­cle en­vi­ron­ment, they might get away with it.</p>
    <p>So in­tra-Repub­li­can ten­sions might ca­reen around for a long while, with Mr Trump him­self ex­tend­ing the or­deal by haunt­ing the House and Se­nate from Mar-a-Lago. And that’s a prob­lem, be­cause the next would-be au­thor­i­tar­ian dem­a­gogue to come along might ac­tu­ally be com­pe­tent, and so po­lit­i­cally ir­re­sistible.</p>
    <p>It’s just too easy to imag­ine a fu­ture sce­nario where, with the courts full of tenured Repub­li­can ap­pointees and both Houses of Congress in Repub­li­can hands, the crazi­ness of a Louie Gohmert sug­gest­ing that one of the two elected mem­bers of the Ex­ec­u­tive Branch could de­cide for him­self whether he and the Pres­i­dent could re­main in of­fice could ac­tu­ally win the day.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can con­sti­tu­tional order is now shown plainly to be less than fool­proof, and there are just too many fools out there for com­fort.</p>
