    <p>The Tai­wanese govern­ment has big plans to make Tai­wan bilin­gual in 10 years, but the project to raise English pro­fi­ciency has drawn flak for be­ing too am­bi­tious, and has sparked con­cerns that it will di­lute at­ten­tion on the is­land’s in­dige­nous lan­guages.</p>
    <p>“Bilin­gual by 2030” aims to help the younger gen­er­a­tion con­nect with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity by learn­ing to speak flu­ently in English and thus pro­mot­ing Tai­wanese val­ues.</p>
    <p>The project was first in­tro­duced by Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen’s ad­min­is­tra­tion in 2018 and has two main ob­jec­tives: to el­e­vate na­tional com­pet­i­tive­ness and cul­ti­vate peo­ple’s English pro­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion said it plans to cre­ate more English-speak­ing en­vi­ron­ments for stu­dents to move be­yond learn­ing only vo­cab­u­lary and gram­mar in school and pro­vide more op­por­tu­ni­ties for civil ser­vants to “hone their abil­ity to com­mu­ni­cate in English”. It also wants to es­tab­lish an exclusive English-lan­guage TV sta­tion while en­cour­ag­ing other me­dia out­lets to pro­vide English cov­er­age, among other plans.</p>
    <p>Of all the lo­cal govern­ment lead­ers, New Taipei City Mayor Hou You-yi is the first to be on board with the pro­posal, say­ing on Aug 21 that he also plans to make sure English be­comes a ma­jor part of res­i­dents’ ev­ery­day life by 2030.</p>
    <p>Mr Hou has his own ini­tia­tive named “Mak­ing New Taipei City a Bilin­gual Mu­nic­i­pal­ity”, which will in­clude dig­i­tal­is­ing English learn­ing in schools.</p>
    <p>English in­struc­tors in Tai­wan, how­ever, are torn about the govern­ment’s am­bi­tious plan.</p>
    <p>Education con­sul­tant and English in­struc­tor Eric Chao Yang said that while the over­all direc­tion of the project is sound, whether the govern­ment will be able to reach its goals by 2030 is un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>“They’re say­ing 2030 be­cause (the slo­gan) is catchy and draws at­ten­tion, but these things usu­ally take a few decades to take shape,” said Mr Yang, 41, who has been in the field of English education in Tai­wan for over 16 years.</p>
    <p>“As a teacher my­self, one of the many prob­lems I’m wor­ried about is the en­croach­ment of in­dige­nous lan­guages,” said Mr Yang.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the 1990s, the Kuom­intang govern­ment banned the pop­u­la­tion from speak­ing any­thing but Man­darin de­spite ob­jec­tions. “Man­darin only, no dialects” was the cen­tral govern­ment’s education pol­icy.</p>
    <p>But the Yi­lan county govern­ment later went ahead with its de­ci­sion to al­low the teach­ing of the Tai­wanese Min­nan di­alect in schools.</p>
    <p>In 1994, the cen­tral govern­ment re­lented and Min­nan be­came a part of the cur­ricu­lum for el­e­men­tary schools across Tai­wan, but it was not manda­tory nor a ma­jor part of the cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til 2001 when all el­e­men­tary school stu­dents were re­quired to study one na­tive lan­guage or di­alect – Min­nan, Hakka or an in­dige­nous lan­guage.</p>
    <p>These aside, Man­darin re­mains the of­fi­cial lan­guage spo­ken in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Some crit­ics also ques­tion the govern­ment’s mo­tive in bring­ing English into ev­ery­day life.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee Tsai-lien, a re­tired high school English teacher, said be­com­ing bilin­gual could mean mak­ing English one of the of­fi­cial lan­guages, like in Sin­ga­pore, In­dia or Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“But that might be dif­fi­cult, be­cause these places had once been un­der Bri­tish rule, while Tai­wan’s older gen­er­a­tion grew up un­der Ja­panese rule and al­ready had a hard time adapt­ing to a Man­darin­speak­ing govern­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>The bilin­gual pol­icy, she said, could also mean adopt­ing what many Euro­pean coun­tries are do­ing – us­ing English as an ad­di­tional lan­guage like a help­ful tool, but not geared to­wards pass­ing ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, 56, is for the Euro­pean method. “What we need to fig­ure out is what role English will be play­ing in our lives and... learn it in or­der to re­ally use it, not just for tests and ex­ams,” she said.</p>
    <p>She finds that there needs to be greater clar­ity on the var­i­ous as­pects of the bilin­gual project – for ex­am­ple, how some class sub­jects such as chem­istry might be taught in English.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang en­cour­ages ed­u­ca­tors and par­ents to voice their opin­ions on the project.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­ready an ex­ist­ing de­mand for (English learn­ing in Tai­wan); you see that just from the sheer num­ber of cram schools on the street. This is what the peo­ple want, but it’s a two-way street too,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment needs feed­back, and if teach­ers re­ally feel strongly about this, they need to make their voices heard.”</p>
