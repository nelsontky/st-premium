    <p>The US states of Cal­i­for­nia, Wash­ing­ton and Ore­gon are suf­fer­ing their worst wild­fire sea­son in his­tory. Aus­tralia had its turn last year.</p>
    <p>This year, there have been floods in parts of Bangladesh, China,</p>
    <p>In­dia, Malaysia, In­done­sia, Ja­pan and Africa, among other places.</p>
    <p>Europe is en­dur­ing a scorch­ing heat­wave. The US state of</p>
    <p>Louisiana has just had its worst hur­ri­cane in more than 160 years.</p>
    <p>We’re get­ting used to events such as these be­com­ing more fre­quent. It’s as if na­ture is re­mind­ing us that Covid-19 is not the only crisis we face and is re­peat­edly draw­ing our at­ten­tion to its ul­ti­mate source.</p>
    <p>We have, by now, con­nected the dots be­tween the emer­gence of pan­demics, de­for­esta­tion and the loss of bio­di­ver­sity, which have driven an­i­mals and birds out of their nat­u­ral habi­tats, closer to hu­mans and thus more eas­ily able to in­fect us with their viruses.</p>
    <p>We have been jolted into ac­cept­ing the re­al­ity that en­vi­ron­men­tal de­struc­tion and pan­demics are two sides of the same coin.</p>
    <p>So when we yearn for a re­turn to “nor­mal”, what kind of nor­mal should we be talk­ing about? Should it be sim­ply a re­turn to the pre-Covid-19 era?</p>
    <p>For grow­ing num­bers of peo­ple, the an­swer is no. We don’t want to go back to a world of re­cur­ring ex­treme weather events and the in­creas­ing dan­ger of still more pan­demics, some of which may be even worse than Covid-19.</p>
    <p>And so, the new cho­rus is that we should not just build back, but “build back bet­ter” – that is, build back so that, among other things such as less in­equal­ity, bet­ter health­care and stronger safety nets, our economies and so­ci­eties are more re­silient and less vul­ner­a­ble to the havoc that na­ture can un­leash.</p>
    <p>But that will need a re­order­ing of pri­or­i­ties, chal­leng­ing the sta­tus quo and man­ag­ing new risks. It will also need more money, chan­nelled to the right places.</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING BACK WORSE</p>
    <p>The temp­ta­tion to do oth­er­wise – that is, “build back worse” – has proved com­pelling. Soon after the out­break of Covid-19 in the United States, for in­stance, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion an­nounced that the En­vi­ron­men­tal Protection Agency would sus­pend en­vi­ron­men­tal reg­u­la­tions in re­sponse to the pan­demic, to help the econ­omy get mov­ing again.</p>
    <p>It was a sim­i­lar story in some other coun­tries that are big pol­luters.</p>
    <p>When China moved out of its crisis phase and be­gan stim­u­lat­ing its econ­omy, it re­port­edly re­laxed the en­force­ment of en­vi­ron­men­tal con­trols.</p>
    <p>In­dia is do­ing the same, judg­ing by a no­ti­fi­ca­tion from its En­vi­ron­ment Min­istry in March, which pro­posed that some projects be ex­empted from en­vi­ron­men­tal ap­praisal and oth­ers that are op­er­at­ing with­out ap­provals be le­galised.</p>
    <p>How tem­po­rary these ret­ro­grade pro­vi­sions will be re­mains to be seen.</p>
    <p>A GREEN REV­O­LU­TION IN FI­NANCE</p>
    <p>But mean­while, the call to build back bet­ter has got through to the world of fi­nance and in­vest­ment, where a green rev­o­lu­tion of sorts is un­der way.</p>
    <p>The amount raised from green bonds is­sued glob­ally (bonds which fi­nance in­vest­ments that are con­sid­ered to be en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly) have soared from a pal­try US$11 bil­lion in 2013 to more than US$258 bil­lion (S$351 bil­lion) last year, about 50 per cent more than in 2018.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate­bonds.net, which tracks the green bond mar­ket, projects that the fig­ure for this year will rise a fur­ther 36 per cent to</p>
    <p>US$350 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sur­veys show that hedge funds and other in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors are also get­ting green-friendly.</p>
    <p>A re­port by KPMG and the Al­ter­na­tive In­vest­ment Man­age­ment As­so­ci­a­tion pub­lished in Fe­bru­ary noted that 72 per cent of hedge fund man­agers cited grow­ing in­ter­est among in­sti­tu­tional clients in in­vest­ments that in­cor­po­rate en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance (ESG) con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has tur­bocharged the de­mand for ESG prod­ucts is­sued by money man­agers. The Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported that this year, to the end of July, global ex­change-traded funds in ESG-re­lated in­vest­ments gar­nered US$38.8 bil­lion of net new money, com­pared with US$26.7 bil­lion in all of last year.</p>
    <p>A re­port by JP­Mor­gan in June de­scribed Covid-19 as a “ma­jor turn­ing point” for in­vestors, who are wis­ing up to the par­al­lels be­tween pan­demics and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>In his an­nual let­ter to chief ex­ec­u­tives this year, Mr Larry Fink, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Black­Rock, one of the world’s largest money man­agers, wrote: “Cli­mate change is al­most in­vari­ably the top is­sue that clients around the world raise with Black­Rock.”</p>
    <p>PROAC­TIVE SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been proac­tive in pro­mot­ing ESG-re­lated fi­nance and in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Since at least 2017, the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has been work­ing to po­si­tion Sin­ga­pore as a hub for green fi­nance in Asia. It pro­vides sub­si­dies for the is­suance of green bonds in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>City De­vel­op­ments, DBS Bank, Ox­ley Hold­ings, the SoilBuild Group and the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore have al­ready is­sued such bonds.</p>
    <p>The MAS has also re­leased a con­sul­ta­tion pa­per on en­vi­ron­men­tal risk man­age­ment for the banking, in­sur­ance and as­set man­age­ment sec­tors with a view to set­ting stan­dards on gov­er­nance, risk man­age­ment and disclosure, so that the fi­nan­cial sys­tem can be more re­silient to en­vi­ron­men­tal risk.</p>
    <p>And the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change re­quires listed com­pa­nies to dis­close their ESG prac­tices.</p>
    <p>These are early steps, but more needs to be done.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, what con­sti­tutes green in­vest­ing is not clearly de­fined.</p>
    <p>A re­port by the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank points to pub­lic perception­s that Sin­ga­pore is en­gag­ing in “green­wash­ing”, with money be­ing raised for pur­port­edly green pur­poses, but in re­al­ity, be­ing de­ployed else­where – al­though this per­cep­tion also ap­plies to other coun­tries where green fi­nance is gain­ing trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Green in­vest­ing has also not yet per­co­lated to the small and medium-sized en­ter­prise sec­tor, whose in­volve­ment in green projects is lim­ited.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also lacks a mar­ket like Lux­em­bourg for the trad­ing of green se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>While fill­ing these gaps will take time, the more short-term chal­lenge, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore, is how to build back bet­ter once economies open up again.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers point out that some op­por­tu­ni­ties have al­ready been missed in the early re­sponses to Covid-19 crisis. For ex­am­ple, most of the eco­nomic stim­u­lus pack­ages rolled out across the world have placed lit­tle or no em­pha­sis on sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>High-car­bon sec­tors have re­ceived bailouts and sub­si­dies with­out any emis­sion-re­duc­tion con­di­tions. Quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing – pro­vi­sions of liq­uid­ity and bond-buy­ing by cen­tral banks – has been broad-based, with no pref­er­ence given to green sec­tors. Ditto for many of the mas­sive fis­cal pack­ages, the Euro­pean Union’s “green new deal” be­ing a stand­out ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>To some ex­tent, this is un­der­stand­able. The first-round re­sponses to the Covid-19 out­break were fo­cused on restor­ing fi­nan­cial mar­ket confidence and cre­at­ing or pro­tect­ing jobs. But as economies re­open, pri­or­i­ties will need to change. Sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues will need to be brought front and cen­tre.</p>
    <p>WHAT IT WILL TAKE</p>
    <p>All fu­ture in­fra­struc­ture – whether en­ergy, trans­port or con­struc­tion – will need to take greater ac­count of cli­mate risks, with com­pa­nies be­ing held ac­count­able for the en­vi­ron­men­tal ef­fects of their in­vest­ments and en­cour­aged to ac­cel­er­ate de­car­bon­i­sa­tion of their pro­duc­tion pro­cesses and prod­ucts – for ex­am­ple, through car­bon taxes.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions can also play a key role by con­duct­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal risk as­sess­ments for projects they fi­nance – al­ready a rou­tine prac­tice among large banks in Sin­ga­pore – al­though not in the re­gion, which cre­ates a loop­hole.</p>
    <p>There will also need to be sub­si­dies and loan guar­an­tees to sup­port the growth of in­no­va­tive green tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>At the so­cial level, con­sumers should be nudged to adopt habits that sup­port sus­tain­abil­ity, such as more re­cy­cling and shar­ing of re­sources, es­chew­ing sin­gle-use plas­tics and even chang­ing di­ets – trends that are al­ready in­cip­i­ent in many parts of the world.</p>
    <p>The shift to more green fi­nance will cre­ate new risks, in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial risks. Banks mak­ing 30-year mort­gages or other term loans will need to take ac­count of cli­mate risks over such a long pe­riod. Like­wise for in­sur­ance com­pa­nies, whose his­tor­i­cal un­der­pric­ing of cli­mate risks has al­ready cost them bil­lions in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>As more re­sources shift to re­new­ables, legacy loans made to the fossil fuel sec­tor may come un­der stress, and there will be a ris­ing dan­ger of com­pa­nies, as well as banks, be­ing left with “stranded as­sets” on their books – that is, as­sets that once pro­duced a re­turn but can no longer re­li­ably do so, and can in fact be­come li­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that are forced to de­car­bonise will face tran­si­tion costs. Some, whose busi­ness mod­els are built around fossil fuels, may go out of busi­ness.</p>
    <p>These are some of the risks that will need to be man­aged in the post-Covid-19 world. Some may prove costly. But in the long run, it will be a small price to pay for the ben­e­fits of build­ing back bet­ter.</p>
