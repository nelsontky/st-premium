    <p>TRUE FRIENDS: Hong Kong ac­tor Felix Wong (above right, with Ed­die Che­ung) may still be mourn­ing for his wife, for­mer actress Le­ung Kit Wah, who died at age 59 in May.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he has his daugh­ter and his friends to help him cope with his grief.</p>
    <p>Wong, a foot­ball fan, turned 59 last Fri­day and his daugh­ter Adrian Wong cel­e­brated the oc­ca­sion with him by get­ting him a foot­ball-themed cake.</p>
    <p>And on Tues­day, it was Felix Wong’s friend, ac­tor Ed­die Che­ung’s turn to cel­e­brate the birth­day.</p>
    <p>Post­ing pho­tos of the small cel­e­bra­tion on so­cial me­dia, Che­ung, 57, wrote in Chi­nese: “Only by go­ing through the ups and downs of life will you know your true friend. Brother, I re­mem­ber that you were with me when I was fac­ing the low­est point of my life.</p>
    <p>“While I dare not say Happy Birth­day to you loudly this year, I wish you health and hope things go well for you every day. My good brother, I will be happy if you are happy too.”</p>
    <p>While Che­ung – known for his roles in movies such as Run­ning On Karma (2003), Elec­tion (2005) and Ex­iled (2006) – did not give de­tails about the low point in his life, his act­ing ca­reer had been af­fected for sev­eral years af­ter he fa­tally knocked down a fan who was seek­ing his au­to­graph in an ac­ci­dent in 1987.</p>
    <p>The pho­tos he posted showed him hav­ing din­ner with Wong and another friend.</p>
    <p>Wong was seen also play­ing foot­ball in July with Che­ung and other Hong Kong celebritie­s in­clud­ing Alan Tam, Ken­neth Ma and Hugo Ng, who were also help­ing him to get over his wife’s death.</p>
