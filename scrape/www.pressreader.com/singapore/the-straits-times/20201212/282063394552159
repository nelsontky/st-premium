    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has not made many for­eign pol­icy pledges. Apart from the vague prom­ise to “re­store US lead­er­ship and cred­i­bil­ity” and re­pair Amer­ica’s al­liances from the dam­age in­flicted on them by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, nei­ther Mr Bi­den nor his team of clos­est ad­vis­ers has said much about what he pro­poses to do on for­eign and se­cu­rity poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Yet there is one topic on which Mr Bi­den has been very spe­cific: Iran, where he prom­ises to re­verse Mr Don­ald Trump’s pol­icy by re­turn­ing the United States in com­pli­ance with the nu­clear deal, as part of a broader pol­icy to over­haul the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>No­body doubts Mr Bi­den’s sin­cer­ity and de­ter­mi­na­tion on this point; much of what he pro­poses to do in the Mid­dle East is what he has ad­vo­cated for decades and rep­re­sents a con­tin­u­a­tion of much of what he pur­sued while in gov­ern­ment as deputy to pres­i­dent Barack Obama. Nor is there much doubt about the abil­ity of Mr Bi­den’s for­eign and se­cu­rity team.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, none of this will be enough to en­sure that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is suc­cess­ful in the Mid­dle East. So, pre­cisely the one re­gion of the world to which Mr Bi­den made the most ex­plicit of all com­mit­ments dur­ing his elec­toral cam­paign is also likely to be the one on which he is most likely to be found want­ing.</p>
    <p>The 2015 nu­clear deal with Iran has as­sumed a myth­i­cal sta­tus in Wash­ing­ton: Democrats see it as the crown­ing achieve­ment of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, while many right-wing Repub­li­cans dis­miss it as the ul­ti­mate be­trayal of, sup­pos­edly, ev­ery­thing Amer­ica stood for in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>That is why one of Mr Trump’s key pol­icy planks con­sisted of Amer­ica walk­ing away from the Iran agree­ment, and why Mr Bi­den is so de­ter­mined that one of his first moves af­ter he is sworn into of­fice next month is to re­in­state Amer­ica’s ad­her­ence to that doc­u­ment.</p>
    <p>But an­other rea­son Mr Bi­den is so de­ter­mined to re­vive the Iran nu­clear deal is his be­lief that a broader ac­com­mo­da­tion with Iran re­mains the key to un­lock­ing a va­ri­ety of other prob­lems in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>For Mr Bi­den, there­fore, re­turn­ing to the nu­clear deal is not only a mat­ter of sym­bol­ism, of a re­turn to “nor­mal” US poli­cies af­ter the hia­tus of Mr Trump, but also a ques­tion of con­vic­tion, a be­lief that no set­tle­ment in the re­gion is pos­si­ble with­out set­tling mat­ters with Iran.</p>
    <p>Sadly, how­ever, mat­ters are more com­pli­cated.</p>
    <p>THE DEAL THAT FAILED TO DE­LIVER</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that the 2015 Iran deal was a diplo­matic feat, a unique ex­am­ple of the US bind­ing to­gether Rus­sia and China plus the three key Euro­pean coun­tries of Bri­tain, France and Ger­many in an ef­fort to pre­vent nu­clear pro­lif­er­a­tion. Hence, it was hailed as an ex­am­ple of how other acute in­ter­na­tional crises – such as North Korea, for ex­am­ple – could be tack­led.</p>
    <p>But it was not to be. First, the deal is not a treaty en­force­able in US law, be­cause Mr Obama knew he would never get his Se­nate to rat­ify it; that is why it bears the awk­ward and un­nec­es­sar­ily com­pli­cated name of the Joint Com­pre­hen­sive Plan of Ac­tion (JCPOA).</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the JCPOA merely sought to stop Iran’s nu­clear quest rather than elim­i­nate it, an achieve­ment in it­self but hardly No­bel Peace Prize ma­te­rial, although many of those who worked on the doc­u­ment were ap­par­ently con­vinced that the prize was theirs.</p>
    <p>The deal also said noth­ing about Iran’s grow­ing mis­sile arse­nal, which could be used to de­liver a fu­ture nu­clear war­head, once the pro­vi­sions of the cur­rent ar­range­ments are sched­uled to ex­pire. Nor was any­thing said about Iran’s be­hav­iour through­out the Mid­dle East, which men­aces many of the gov­ern­ments in the re­gion more than a fu­ture nu­clear weapon.</p>
    <p>And the idea that the JCPOA held the prom­ise of a closer and more fruit­ful US-China-Rus­sia co­op­er­a­tion was dead on ar­rival: At the very same time that the JCPOA was be­ing con­cluded in 2015, Rus­sia was mount­ing its mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tion in Syria, which essen­tially un­der­cut US op­tions in the re­gion, while the story of Amer­ica’s ris­ing ten­sions with China is by now too fa­mil­iar to need retelling.</p>
    <p>In short, the JCPOA was a doc­u­ment which be­lied the mean­ing of ev­ery sin­gle one of the words in its ti­tle: It was not joint, it was hardly com­pre­hen­sive, it did not amount to much of a plan and it led to no sub­stan­tial ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, the Pres­i­dent-elect may be right in his ini­tial cal­cu­la­tion that, if the US is to re­turn to its role as the chief in­ter­locu­tor and me­di­a­tor in the Mid­dle East, it must re­in­state its com­mit­ment to the JCPOA, if only to re­gain Iran’s trust.</p>
    <p>SHAKY AS­SUMP­TIONS</p>
    <p>The snag is that al­most ev­ery other as­sump­tion Mr Bi­den makes about the process of re­in­stat­ing the nu­clear deal is, at best, shaky.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den for­eign pol­icy team ap­pears to be­lieve that it is pos­si­ble to res­ur­rect the JCPOA with­out too much dam­age to ei­ther side – the US will re­turn to the deal, and Iran will do the same. This is what of­fi­cials close to Mr Bi­den call the “com­pli­ance for com­pli­ance” strat­egy.</p>
    <p>There is also an as­sump­tion that the re­in­state­ment of the JCPOA will serve as a pre­lude to a more ex­ten­sive dia­logue be­tween the US and Iran that will con­sider Iran’s con­ven­tional ar­se­nals and grow­ing mis­sile ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, Mr Bi­den’s in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion seems to think that Amer­ica’s re­gional al­lies – and par­tic­u­larly Is­rael and Saudi</p>
    <p>Ara­bia – will be re­as­sured by Wash­ing­ton’s readi­ness to ad­dress the broader ques­tion of Iran’s desta­bil­i­sa­tion ef­forts in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>But most of th­ese as­sump­tions are mis­con­ceived. Iran is al­ready on record as stat­ing that it would not ac­cept the re­turn of the US to the JCPOA as though noth­ing has hap­pened. At the very least, Te­heran will de­mand guar­an­tees that the US will not be able to leave the deal in the fu­ture again, the sort of guar­an­tee Mr Bi­den can­not pro­vide, for this would im­ply that the JCPOA has the force of a treaty un­der US law.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect’s de­mand – that Iran re­turns to full com­pli­ance with the nu­clear deal by re­duc­ing its stock­pile of low en­riched ura­nium, dis­man­tling the ad­vanced cen­trifuges at Natanz, and halt­ing other steps on nu­clear re­search and devel­op­ment – looks in­creas­ingly un­re­al­is­tic. At the very best, Mr Bi­den will have to muster the courage to re­turn to the JCPOA first with­out get­ting any of th­ese con­ces­sions, some­thing which will make his do­mes­tic po­si­tion in the US very dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Then, there is the ques­tion of sanc­tions. Un­der Mr Bi­den’s cur­rent plans, Te­heran would have to trust the US to re­turn to the JCPOA, and ac­cept the pos­si­bil­ity of open­ing new dis­cus­sions with Wash­ing­ton with­out first get­ting a com­pre­hen­sive lift­ing of the sanc­tions which Mr Trump has im­posed on Iran.</p>
    <p>ELEC­TION TIME</p>
    <p>But it is highly doubt­ful that the Ira­ni­ans will ac­cept such a se­quence of events, es­pe­cially in the run-up to the coun­try’s presidenti­al elec­tion next June. The re­sult is that, if Mr Bi­den wants to get any move­ment, he will have to of­fer con­ces­sions first, and that will make the in­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­pear weak.</p>
    <p>Iran is al­ready in the throes of the elec­tion, in which hard­lin­ers are in the as­cen­dancy. Ru­mours that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is gravely ill should not be taken too se­ri­ously; they have been swirling around for years. Still, there is no ques­tion that the coun­try’s fu­ture – at least for much of the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion – be­longs to peo­ple who be­lieve in tac­ti­cal, rather than en­dur­ing, deals with the US.</p>
    <p>To be sure, there are plenty of pre­vi­ous ex­am­ples of Iran prov­ing to be more re­source­ful and more flex­i­ble in ne­go­ti­a­tions with the Amer­i­cans than its of­fi­cial po­si­tion would sug­gest. But to make progress, the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will have to en­gage in se­cret bi­lat­eral diplo­macy with Iran, and the more it does that, the more this will alarm US al­lies in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den may have less trou­ble than com­monly as­sumed in fac­ing down Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu, who is be­set by do­mes­tic trou­bles be­cause of his mis­han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and may well face fresh elec­tions as well as crim­i­nal charges for al­leged cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet the re­al­ity is that the Mid­dle East which Mr Bi­den re­mem­bers when he was last in gov­ern­ment has been ir­re­versibly changed by what the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has done.</p>
    <p>As much as it may like to, it is dif­fi­cult to see a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion over­turn­ing the recog­ni­tion of Jerusalem as Is­rael’s cap­i­tal. Nor is a Bi­den White House likely to ar­gue for a cool­ing of re­la­tions be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates, or Bahrain, or any other Arab coun­tries.</p>
    <p>All th­ese facts cre­ated by Mr Trump’s poli­cies will re­main in place, and all mean that the op­po­si­tion in the Mid­dle East to a US rap­proche­ment with Iran will be more sus­tained, bet­ter or­gan­ised and per­haps more ef­fec­tive than ever be­fore.</p>
    <p>None of this is to sug­gest that Mr Bi­den is wrong to seek a dif­fer­ent ap­proach in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Clearly, Mr Trump’s pol­icy of ap­ply­ing “max­i­mum pres­sure” on Iran is not pro­duc­ing the hoped-for re­sults. And clearly, bro­ker­ing deals be­tween Is­rael and Arab states with­out deal­ing with the ques­tion of the Pales­tini­ans – an­other hall­mark of the Trump pres­i­dency – is not sus­tain­able ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Bi­den is sure to dis­cover that sim­ply re­in­stat­ing the old props of the for­mer Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion does not amount to much of a strat­egy. Ex­pect this to be­come painfully ob­vi­ous by this time next year.</p>
