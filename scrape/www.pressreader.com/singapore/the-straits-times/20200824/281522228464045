    <p>It was a sea of red and white at In­de­pen­dence Square in Minsk yes­ter­day, as tens of thou­sands of protesters car­ried flags to sym­bol­ise their op­po­si­tion to Be­larus Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko. Mass demon­stra­tions have been held in the cap­i­tal and other parts of the coun­try since the dis­puted elec­tion on Aug 9 which re­turned Mr Lukashenko to his sixth term in of­fice. The Be­larus army warned yes­ter­day that it, and not the po­lice, would re­spond to any op­po­si­tion un­rest near the city’s na­tional memo­ri­als.</p>
    <p>MINSK • Tens of thou­sands of antigov­ern­ment protesters packed the streets of Minsk yes­ter­day as the army waded into Be­larus’ po­lit­i­cal cri­sis, warn­ing that it, not the po­lice, would re­spond to any op­po­si­tion un­rest near the city’s na­tional memo­ri­als.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tions have been held in the cap­i­tal and other Be­laru­sian towns since Aug 9, when an elec­tion – which protesters de­scribe as rigged – granted vet­eran leader Alexan­der Lukashenko a sixth term in of­fice.</p>
    <p>The streets of Minsk turned red and white as a flood of demon­stra­tors car­ried flags sym­bol­is­ing their op­po­si­tion to Mr Lukashenko, de­mand­ing he quit af­ter 26 years in power and new elec­tions be held, videos showed.</p>
    <p>They marched to­wards a mon­u­ment that was sur­rounded by a chain of se­cu­rity ser­vice mem­bers clad in mil­i­tary uni­form, a wit­ness said.</p>
    <p>The De­fence Min­istry said it had taken over re­spon­si­bil­ity for the pro­tec­tion of such memo­ri­als, and that any un­rest near them would elicit a re­sponse from the army.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the protesters as “fas­cists” and writ­ing the ma­jor­ity of its state­ment in cap­i­tal let­ters, the De­fence Min­istry said the memo­ri­als, specif­i­cally to vic­tims of World War II, were holy sites that must not be des­e­crated.</p>
    <p>“We cat­e­gor­i­cally warn: Any vi­o­la­tion of peace and or­der in such places – you will have the army to deal with now, not the po­lice,” it wrote in cap­i­tal let­ters.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Be­larus In­te­rior Min­istry warned that any un­sanc­tioned protests were con­sid­ered il­le­gal and said 22 peo­ple had been ar­rested the pre­vi­ous day, when smaller-scale protests took place across 55 towns and cities.</p>
    <p>Sol­i­dar­ity ral­lies were also sched­uled in neigh­bour­ing Lithua­nia, where demon­stra­tors planned to form a hu­man chain from Vil­nius to the bor­der with Be­larus, 31 years af­ter res­i­dents of the Baltic states joined hands and linked their cap­i­tal cities in a mass protest against Soviet rule.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union’s top diplo­mat, Mr Josep Bor­rell, warned yes­ter­day that Be­larus should not be al­lowed to be­come a “sec­ond Ukraine” and said it was nec­es­sary to deal with Pres­i­dent Lukashenko.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko or­dered his army into full com­bat readi­ness dur­ing an army in­spec­tion on Satur­day near the bor­der with the EU and warned about Nato troop “stir­rings” in Europe.</p>
    <p>“The Fa­ther­land is now in dang e r . We can­not joke,” Mr Lukashenko said.</p>
    <p>The un­likely leader of Be­larus’ op­po­si­tion, 37-year-old Ms Svet­lana Tikhanovsk­aya, fled to Vil­nius fear­ing reprisals for claim­ing vic­tory in the elec­tion and mount­ing the great­est chal­lenge to Mr Lukashenko over his 26-year rule.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view ahead of yes­ter­day’s demon­stra­tion, she urged protesters to con­tinue to ex­ert pres­sure on the au­thor­i­ties, say­ing it was “im­por­tant to con­tinue to be united in the strug­gle for rights”.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have to un­der­stand that “we are not a protest move­ment... We are a ma­jor­ity and we will not step away”, she said.</p>
    <p>Mos­cow con­sid­ers re­form of the Be­laru­sian Con­sti­tu­tion a vi­able so­lu­tion to the coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal cri­sis, Rus­sian For­eign Min­is­ter Sergey Lavrov said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lavrov also said that Mos­cow be­lieves the sit­u­a­tion in Be­larus is now sta­bil­is­ing.</p>
