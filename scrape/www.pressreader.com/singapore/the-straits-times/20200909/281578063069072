    <p>Sin­ga­pore will switch to a satel­lite-based elec­tronic road pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem in the mid­dle of 2023, but plans to charge mo­torists ac­cord­ing to the dis­tances they clock have been put on hold.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will switch to a satel­lite­based Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem in the mid­dle of 2023, but plans to charge mo­torists ac­cord­ing to the dis­tances they clock have been put on hold.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) said yes­ter­day that in­stal­la­tion of a new on-board unit (OBU), which re­places the cur­rent in­ve­hi­cle unit, will start in the lat­ter half of next year. The ini­tial unit will be free.</p>
    <p>LTA had said pre­vi­ously that in­stal­la­tion would start by the end of this year. Be­cause the Covid-19 pan­demic im­pacted global sup­ply chains, the ex­er­cise – which in­volves close to one mil­lion ve­hi­cles – will com­mence next year, and take place over 18 months.</p>
    <p>The new ERP sys­tem will switch on in mid-2023, with the ex­ist­ing cor­don-based con­ges­tion pric­ing frame­work still in place. The ERP charg­ing lo­ca­tions will also be clearly in­di­cated on “smaller and slim­mer gantries”.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said: “How ERP works will not change. What will change is there is no need for big gantries any­more. Also, the in-ve­hi­cle unit will need to be re­placed – FOC – with a new one, with a big­ger screen that can dis­play maps and traf­fic info and safety alerts.”</p>
    <p>The new ERP sys­tem will have more fea­tures than the cur­rent one. Be­sides pro­vid­ing in­for­ma­tion on charg­ing lo­ca­tions and rates, the OBU will pro­vide re­al­time traf­fic up­dates as well as lo­ca­tions of nearby school zones and Sil­ver Zones, LTA said.</p>
    <p>Clas­sic and vin­tage car own­ers will be given the op­tion to in­stall the OBU. But those who choose not to will be sub­ject to fur­ther us­age re­stric­tions as well as sep­a­rate con­ges­tion fees, LTA said.</p>
    <p>The new ERP sys­tem will re­place the cur­rent 22-year-old one which, the author­ity said, was “reach­ing the end of its oper­a­tional life”.</p>
    <p>The new OBU will have two de­signs – a one-piece unit for mo­tor­cy­cles, and for other ve­hi­cles, a three-piece sys­tem com­pris­ing an an­tenna, a touch­screen dis­play to be mounted on the wind­screen and a pro­cess­ing unit which can be mounted be­neath the dash­board.</p>
    <p>The new OBU is com­pat­i­ble with the cur­rent ERP sys­tems and carparks. Mo­torists can con­tinue to use Nets FlashPay and ez-link cards, or credit or debit cards, to make pay­ment.</p>
    <p>LTA said the pri­vacy of mo­torists will be safeguarde­d.</p>
    <p>“LTA will only use anonymised or ag­gre­gated data for traf­fic man­age­ment and trans­port plan­ning pur­poses,” it said. “Ve­hi­cle-spe­cific data will be used only for pay­ment, charges and en­force­ment.”</p>
    <p>It added that to pre­vent unau­tho­rised ac­cess and im­proper use of the data, there will be “ro­bust se­cu­rity and strict safe­guards”, in­clud­ing penal­ties for in­fringe­ment.</p>
    <p>Plans for a satel­lite-based, gantry-less ERP sys­tem which can charge ac­cord­ing to the dis­tance cov­ered by a ve­hi­cle and which can be is­land­wide started soon af­ter the cur­rent sys­tem went “live” in 1998.</p>
    <p>Af­ter years of stud­ies, tests and tri­als, it was de­cided that such a sys­tem was fea­si­ble. In 2016, LTA awarded a $556 mil­lion con­tract to NCS and MHI En­gine Sys­tem to build the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Busi­ness School ad­junct as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Za­far Momin said that un­til dis­tance­based charg­ing is avail­able, “it sounds like we will prob­a­bly just have a slightly up­graded cor­don­based charg­ing ERP sys­tem with a few more bells and whis­tles”.</p>
    <p>IT spe­cial­ist Larry Leong, who pro­vided in­puts for Jakarta’s road pric­ing pro­ject, said the OBU for the Sin­ga­pore sys­tem is “old-fash­ioned”. “The in­tent is great, but the tech is too old,” he said, adding that an app-based open plat­form would have been bet­ter and more cost-ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“It is time to move away from card-based pay­ments,” he noted. “Adopt mod­ern pay­ment meth­ods for a mod­ern ERP.”</p>
    <p>He added that in­stal­la­tion of a three-piece OBU will re­quire space and more wiring, and may be a chal­lenge in newer cars.</p>
    <p>West Coast GRC MP Ang Wei Neng reck­oned the sys­tem will go through a tran­si­tion phase. “It lever­ages GNSS (Global Nav­i­ga­tion Satel­lite Sys­tem), paving the way for us to do more things when the sys­tem is sta­bilised,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists wel­come the ad­di­tional fea­tures of the next-gen­er­a­tion Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem, but feel its three-piece on­board unit (OBU) is clunky, in­el­e­gant and takes up too much space.</p>
    <p>Mr Eu­gene Ong, 50, said: “Sin­ga­pore­ans love their cars, and they want to pre­serve the orig­i­nal look and feel as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“It would be good if we can have the OBU in­ter­face with the in­fo­tain­ment sys­tems – which most mod­ern cars have – so that there is no need for an­other touch­screen.”</p>
    <p>As for cars with­out an in­fo­tain­ment screen that can in­ter­face with the OBU, the sales di­rec­tor sug­gested op­tions for “flex­i­ble place­ment” of the touch­screen.</p>
    <p>Free­lance writer Lynn Tan, 42, said: “The ad­di­tional fea­tures on the OBU are use­ful for mo­torists be­cause not ev­ery­one uses driv­ing apps and not ev­ery car is equipped with a nav­i­ga­tion sys­tem with re­al­time up­dates.</p>
    <p>“But I wish the de­sign of the OBU can be less bulky. For in­stance, can the pro­cess­ing unit be in­te­grated with the touch­screen with­out adding to its bulk? If not, can the unit be con­cealed?”</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Lai Meng, 61, who drives as well as rides a mo­tor­bike, said he likes the new fea­tures of the new ERP sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“It also makes sense to do a pro­gres­sive roll-out of the new sys­tem to work out the bugs.</p>
    <p>“But I hope dis­tance-based charg­ing can be im­ple­mented soon.”</p>
    <p>He said such charg­ing will en­cour­age “a more ju­di­cious driv­ing cul­ture in Sin­ga­pore and, hope­fully, an ad­just­ment to the cur­rent front-heavy mo­tor­ing tax regime”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan agreed: “I am all for dis­tance-based charg­ing as it seems like a fairer sys­tem. The far­ther you drive, the more you pay.”</p>
    <p>Air­line pilot An­drew Koh, 39, said: “I can­not com­pre­hend why there is a need for more than one type of on­board unit. Why would bik­ers and non-bik­ers re­quire a dif­fer­ent dis­play size and type? Wouldn’t a three-piece unit mean un­nec­es­sar­ily higher unit cost and tech­ni­cal in­stal­la­tion com­pli­ca­tions?”</p>
    <p>He added that hav­ing such a sys­tem would also re­quire the stock­ing of mul­ti­ple com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness con­sul­tant Al­bert Lee, 61, said he hopes a dis­tance-based charg­ing plat­form can be im­ple­mented soon so up­front car taxes can be re­viewed. “A us­age-based charg­ing sys­tem must serve its pur­pose, and not be seen merely as mo­torists hav­ing to pay more.”</p>
    <p>Car taxes were re­duced and more cer­tifi­cates of en­ti­tle­ment re­leased soon af­ter the cur­rent ERP sys­tem be­gan in 1998.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has asked the Land Trans­port Author­ity when the sys­tem can start charg­ing for dis­tance and if the pro­ject cost of $556 mil­lion in­cluded a dis­tancecharg­ing fea­ture.</p>
