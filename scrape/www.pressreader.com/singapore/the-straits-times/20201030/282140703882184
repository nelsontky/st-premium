    <p>TAIPEI • A Tai­wanese fighter jet crashed and its pi­lot was killed while train­ing over the West­ern Pa­cific, high­light­ing con­cerns about the is­land’s age­ing mil­i­tary fleet at a time of in­creased pres­sure from China’s air force.</p>
    <p>Res­cuers are search­ing for a Tai­wanese F-5 jet af­ter it plunged into the sea off the east coast of Taitung county dur­ing a train­ing ex­er­cise yes­ter­day morn­ing, ac­cord­ing to a</p>
    <p>De­fence Min­istry spokesman.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot, who had ejected and was res­cued, later died de­spite hours of emer­gency treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent fu­els mount­ing wor­ries about the re­li­a­bil­ity of the older air­craft in Tai­wan’s age­ing mil­i­tary fleet at a time of near-daily Chi­nese in­cur­sions into the is­land’s air de­fence iden­ti­fi­ca­tion zone (ADIZ).</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has scram­bled al­most 3,000 jets this year in re­sponse to ap­proaches by more than 1,700 Chi­nese air­craft. Chi­nese jets have en­tered Tai­wan’s ADIZ 19 days in a row this month, ac­cord­ing to De­fence Min­istry data.</p>
    <p>The crash is the lat­est in a series of such in­ci­dents to be­fall Tai­wan’s mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the is­land lost its most se­nior uni­formed of­fi­cer, along with 12 oth­ers, when the he­li­copter they were trav­el­ling in went down in bad weather south of Taipei.</p>
    <p>Two pi­lots also died when their he­li­copter crashed in July.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan plans to re­tire its F-5 jets in 2026, when the United States com­pletes de­liv­ery on 66 F-16V jets, the Taipei-based Cen­tral News Agency re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s F-5s have been in ser­vice since the mid-1970s and are now pre­dom­i­nantly used for train­ing. The US stopped build­ing F-5s in 1989, leav­ing Tai­wan strug­gling to find parts to keep them work­ing.</p>
    <p>While the US has re­jected Tai­wanese of­fers to buy F-35s, it is seek­ing to rem­edy the prob­lem by up­grad­ing Tai­wan’s fleet of newer – but not ex­actly cut­ting edge – F-16s built by Lock­heed Martin.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion signed the deal to sell Tai­wan 66</p>
    <p>F-16s in Au­gust, the first US sale of ad­vanced jets to Taipei since Pres­i­dent Ge­orge H. W. Bush ap­proved a deal for 150 F-16s in 1992.</p>
    <p>China strongly protests against any US arms sales to Tai­wan, and this week said it would im­pose sanc­tions on Boe­ing’s de­fence unit, Lock­heed Martin and Raytheon Tech­nolo­gies af­ter the US State Depart­ment ap­proved an­other arms sale to the is­land.</p>
