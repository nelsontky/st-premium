        <p>WASHINGTON • Walk­ing through cen­tral Washington, it is dif­fi­cult to dis­tin­guish be­tween those build­ings boarded up due to pan­demic clo­sures, and those boarded up due to ri­ots.</p>
        <p>The cap­i­tal of the United States is known for its grand vis­tas, his­tor­i­cal mon­u­ments and crowds of tourists, but the city has rad­i­cally changed in the last year.</p>
        <p>“This is my first time (in down­town Washington) in a year. There are usu­ally peo­ple walk­ing all over the place. This is very, very quiet. I al­most think it’s like a ghost of it­self,” said Jaime, a mother from Mary­land, who did not wish to give her full name.</p>
        <p>Hordes of school­child­ren who nor­mally travel from all over the coun­try to visit mu­se­ums and see the White House now stay at home, as do most for­eign tourists.</p>
        <p>The hec­tic jos­tle of politi­cians, lob­by­ists and lawyers on the street has also fallen quiet, while metro sta­tions that bring work­ers in from sub­urbs are quiet and lit­tle-used.</p>
        <p>The city of more than 700,000 is sub­dued, a week be­fore the pres­i­den­tial in­au­gu­ra­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den on the steps of the Capi­tol.</p>
        <p>“The city is ba­si­cally des­o­late,” said Ms Na­dine Seiler, 55, who has been demon­strat­ing every day since the end of Oc­to­ber last year near the White House in favour of anti-racism causes. “Usu­ally it’s very stress­ful, but here, it’s like ev­ery­body’s away on va­ca­tion.”</p>
        <p>As in many Western cities, many work­ers have been sign­ing in to work from home – es­pe­cially staff at big in­sti­tu­tions head­quar­tered in Washington, such as the World Bank and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund, as well as gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
        <p>The city’s fa­mous mu­se­ums, most of them free, have been closed since last March. And Mayor Muriel Bowser has again tight­ened re­stric­tions so that restau­rants can no longer serve any in­door cus­tomers.</p>
        <p>Mr Ti­mothy Bartholome­w, a res­i­dent of Ar­ling­ton, just over the Po­tomac river, said: “I went to the Christ­mas mar­ket... that’s gone, all that’s gone. You go into bars, (pre­vi­ously) packed bars – they’re gone.”</p>
        <p>Ac­cord­ing to the spe­cial­ist site Eater, nearly 70 restau­rants have per­ma­nently closed in Washington since the start of the pan­demic, and many oth­ers are boarded up with­out cer­tainty that they will ever re­open.</p>
        <p>The eco­nomic fall­out is even more starkly ev­i­dent in the length­en­ing lines at soup kitchens and the spread of tents shel­ter­ing home­less peo­ple un­der bridges and along main roads.</p>
        <p>Vi­o­lent protests and un­rest have also shaken Washington re­peat­edly in the last year.</p>
        <p>Af­ter the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd at the hands of the po­lice in Min­neapo­lis in May last year, Washington be­came a hot spot for na­tion­wide anti-racism demon­stra­tions. The city au­thor­i­ties painted huge yel­low letters read­ing “Black Lives Mat­ter” across a street out­side the White House, and the lo­ca­tion be­came a pop­u­lar site for ral­lies.</p>
        <p>But over the months, clashes be­tween anti-racism ac­tivists and pro-Trump pro­test­ers have brought an edge of ten­sion to the city. Roads and side­walks have been grad­u­ally shut down around the White House, with the se­cu­rity cor­don</p>
        <p>hold­ing peo­ple far back from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s res­i­dence.</p>
        <p>Po­lice cars keep their flash­ing lights on at all times and block streets nor­mally stream­ing with traf­fic, while high me­tal fences sur­round many gov­ern­ment build­ings, like the US Trea­sury.</p>
        <p>Since pro-Trump ri­ot­ers stormed the US Capi­tol, the seat of the leg­isla­tive branch, last Wed­nes­day, the build­ing has been at the cen­tre of the crack­down, with a heavy pres­ence of se­cu­rity forces pa­trolling a new perime­ter fence.</p>
        <p>The troop de­ploy­ment around the city has in­creased every day ahead of the Jan 20 in­au­gu­ra­tion, when there will be no cheer­ing crowds to wel­come the new pres­i­dent.</p>
        <p>In­stead, se­cu­rity forces pa­trol in hel­mets and fa­tigues, and they will re­main de­ployed un­til at least af­ter the in­au­gu­ra­tion, giv­ing Washington an un­typ­i­cally mil­i­tary feel.</p>
        <p>Na­tional Guard troops de­ployed on the streets of Washington be­gan car­ry­ing weapons on Tues­day in a ma­jor change of pos­ture ahead of Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion, ac­cord­ing to an Agence France-Presse pho­tog­ra­pher.</p>
        <p>The Guard sol­diers were orig­i­nally mo­bilised to pro­vide mostly lo­gis­ti­cal sup­port to Washington po­lice and, on Mon­day, Gen­eral Daniel Hokan­son, Pen­tagon Na­tional Guard Bureau chief, said they had not been au­tho­rised yet to carry weapons.</p>
        <p>Au­tho­ris­ing Guard mem­bers to de­ploy in a law en­force­ment role – armed and em­pow­ered to make ar­rests – would be a last re­sort if the se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion got out of hand, Gen Hokan­son said.</p>
        <p>It was not clear what changed late on Tues­day, and the city’s Na­tional Guard had no com­ment.</p>
        <p>Se­cu­rity ex­perts said chat­ter among ex­trem­ists and Trump sup­port­ers online about hold­ing armed marches and threat­en­ing vi­o­lence in the US cap­i­tal and other cities had surged in re­cent days.</p>
        <p>The Pen­tagon is mo­bil­is­ing up to 15,000 Na­tional Guard troops for the in­au­gu­ra­tion, as Mr Trump and sup­port­ers still refuse to ac­cept Mr Bi­den’s elec­tion vic­tory two months ago.</p>
        <p>Five peo­ple died on Wed­nes­day last week when Trump sup­port­ers at­tacked and shut down the US Congress in a bid to halt the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of Mr Bi­den’s elec­tion win. At the time, Guard troops were nearby but were un­armed and called in too late to back up the Capi­tol Po­lice.</p>
