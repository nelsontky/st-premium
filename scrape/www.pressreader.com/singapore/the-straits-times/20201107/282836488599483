    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) has made a po­lice re­port af­ter an on­line di­a­logue ses­sion with mem­bers of the fra­ter­nity on Thurs­day was briefly in­ter­rupted by an un­known at­tendee who drew lewd graf­fiti on a shared screen.</p>
    <p>In a me­dia state­ment yes­ter­day, Lien Choong Luen, who is pres­i­dent of the na­tional track and field body, said: “We take this dis­rup­tion se­ri­ously as it af­fected a ses­sion in­volv­ing our ath­let­ics com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“A big part of our mis­sion is to be more in­clu­sive and con­sul­ta­tive, in­clud­ing ses­sions such as this.</p>
    <p>“We hope to have more of such di­a­logues in the fu­ture in an open fash­ion, hence we have to send a strong mes­sage that such dis­rup­tive ac­tions will not be taken lightly.”</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent took place dur­ing a Zoom town­hall ses­sion SA had or­gan­ised for ath­letes, their par­ents and coaches, to in­tro­duce SA’s new man­age­ment team and sec­re­tar­iat staff and their plans for the sport.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia were also in­vited to sit in on the ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cal de­tails for those hop­ing to earn a nom­i­na­tion for next year’s SEA Games in Viet­nam, such as bench­marks and po­ten­tial</p>
    <p>qual­i­fy­ing com­pe­ti­tions, were also shared.</p>
    <p>How­ever, be­fore the vir­tual town­hall started, a crude im­age which re­sem­bled male gen­i­talia was drawn on the screen.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the meet­ing ad­min­is­tra­tors took down the im­age and at­tempted to ad­dress “house­keep­ing is­sues”, a sec­ond i mage was drawn, be­fore it too was re­moved.</p>
    <p>To­day re­ported that pornogra</p>
    <p>phy was also dis­played briefly.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood the sus­pected per­pe­tra­tor was later ejected from the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran sprints coach Mar­garet Oh, 60, was among the at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>The for­mer na­tional ath­lete, a mother of two daugh­ters, said: “My im­me­di­ate re­ac­tion when see­ing that was won­der­ing who was the id­iot that was do­ing it… I think it was just some­one play­ing punk.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, she added she felt the in­ci­dent was “not re­ally a big mat­ter” and said that she felt coun­selling would suf­fice if it turns out the of­fender is a young per­son.</p>
    <p>Lien said SA would also con­duct its own in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions to try and iden­tify the in­di­vid­u­als re­spon­si­ble for the act, and would hand over any in­for­ma­tion it gath­ers to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We sin­cerely apol­o­gise to all at­ten­dees for the dis­rup­tion, par­tic­u­larly given its of­fen­sive na­ture.</p>
    <p>“In fu­ture, be as­sured we will ex­er­cise the ut­most con­trol over our on­line meet­ings,” he added.</p>
    <p>Lien and his nine-per­son slate were voted in as SA’s lead­er­ship for the next two years on Sept 25.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times that meet­ing ad­min­is­tra­tors had taken “a less re­stric­tive ap­proach (to the Zoom set­tings) as we wanted to have a more smooth in­ter­ac­tion”, but he also promised SA would “take greater note of these pro­tec­tive set­tings” in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>TAK­ING AC­TION</p>
    <p>We hope to have more of such di­a­logues in the fu­ture in an open fash­ion, hence we have to send a strong mes­sage that such dis­rup­tive ac­tions will not be taken lightly... In fu­ture, be as­sured we will ex­er­cise the ut­most con­trol over our on­line meet­ings.</p>
    <p>LIEN CHOONG LUEN, SA pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>PROVOCA­TIVE AC­TION</p>
    <p>My im­me­di­ate re­ac­tion when see­ing that was won­der­ing who was the id­iot that was do­ing it… I think it was just some­one play­ing punk.</p>
    <p>MAR­GARET OH, sprints coach, on not be­ing amused by the lewd graf­fiti that ap­peared in the vir­tual meet­ing.</p>
