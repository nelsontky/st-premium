    <p>The Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) has re­moved a Chi­nese-lan­guage chil­dren’s book for re­view af­ter a reader com­plained it is racist.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for NLB said on Sun­day evening that the board is cur­rently re­view­ing the book, in view of feed­back from its pa­trons.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added: “This will be done in con­sul­ta­tion with our Li­brary Con­sul­ta­tive Panel, which is an in­de­pen­dent and cit­i­zen-based panel.</p>
    <p>“In line with our estab­lished pro­ce­dures, we have re­moved all copies of the book from our li­braries dur­ing the pe­riod of re­view.”</p>
    <p>Who Wins? by Wu Xing Hua is a pic­ture book that fea­tures a “dark­skinned” boy with “oily curly hair” named Mao Mao – Chi­nese for hairy – who is an ag­gres­sive school bully. The book, for chil­dren aged seven to nine, was pub­lished in 2018 in Sin­ga­pore by Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It is part of a se­ries of five books ti­tled Amaz­ing Ad­ven­tures Of Pi Pi.</p>
    <p>Li­brary user Estella Young, 42, had writ­ten a post about it on her Face­book page last Fri­day un­der the so­cial me­dia name Umm Yu­sof.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the book as “as­tound­ingly racist”, she noted in the post that the vil­lain was be­ing writ­ten about in “ex­plic­itly racialised terms, and in con­trast to all the other char­ac­ters who are de­picted as fair-skinned”.</p>
    <p>She added: “What on earth pos­sessed Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion to pub­lish a book in which the sole dark-skinned char­ac­ter is ir­re­deemably nasty – espe­cially when his ap­pear­ance is ir­rel­e­vant to the plot?”</p>
    <p>Ms Young, a free­lance writer, told The Straits Times that she had bor­rowed the book last Thurs­day from Be­dok Li­brary to read to her eightyear-old son, and was shocked while flip­ping through it at home.</p>
    <p>She then sub­mit­ted feed­back to the NLB via its Re­quest for Re­view of Li­brary Ma­te­ri­als ser­vice on­line last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how long the re­view will take, but as long as they’re re­view­ing it, that’s a good thing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ali­cia Tan, se­nior mar­ket­ing man­ager at Mar­shall Cavendish Ed­u­ca­tion, said yes­ter­day that the pub­lisher has re­ceived in­quiries about the book.</p>
    <p>She added: “We are do­ing our ut­most to look into, and re­solve, the is­sue so please al­low us some time to check with the rel­e­vant par­ties.”</p>
    <p>In 2017, the NLB re­moved a se­ries of Malay-lan­guage books for young peo­ple from its shelves af­ter a Twit­ter user shared pho­tos of them.</p>
    <p>The Agama, Ta­madun Dan Arke­ologi (Re­li­gion, Civil­i­sa­tion And Ar­chae­ol­ogy) se­ries was flagged for con­tain­ing anti-Semitic rhetoric and seem­ingly glo­ri­fy­ing vi­o­lence in the name of Is­lam.</p>
    <p>The Li­brary Con­sul­ta­tive Panel, which con­sists of mem­bers from a cross-sec­tion of so­ci­ety, sup­ported the NLB’s move to re­move the eight books, not­ing that the se­ries “has the po­ten­tial of cre­at­ing re­li­gious and racial ten­sions among read­ers and the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>NOT ALL THAT EF­FEC­TIVE Most of the time, the mosquitoes sim­ply move away to the neigh­bour­ing ar­eas ’’ (when you do fog­ging).</p>
    <p>MR DE­CLAN EE, di­rec­tor of pest con­trol firm Ikari Ser­vices, not­ing that fog­ging only kills mosquitoes pre­sent at that time.</p>
