    <p>Sin­ga­pore con­firmed seven new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing one in the com­mu­nity for the first time in four days.</p>
    <p>The lone com­mu­nity case is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who is a fam­ily mem­ber of two pre­vi­ously con­firmed im­ported cases, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said last night.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily mem­bers had ar­rived from In­done­sia on Sept 25, and were granted per­mis­sion to serve their stay-home no­tices at home as one is a two-month-old in­fant, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The new case had been placed on stay-home no­tice due to his ex­po­sure to them, and de­vel­oped symp­toms dur­ing quar­an­tine. He sub­se­quently tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The other new pa­tients yes­ter­day com­prise one lo­cally trans­mit­ted case in a worker’s dor­mi­tory, as well as five im­ported cases who were placed on stay-home no­tices or iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The asymp­to­matic case in the dor­mi­tory was picked up through rou­tine bi-weekly test­ing, MOH said.</p>
    <p>Of the im­ported cases, one is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from Be­larus and one is a Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zen who re­turned from Qatar.</p>
    <p>Another is a work pass holder who had ar­rived from France, while the re­main­ing two were sea crew who ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from the Philip­pines to board a ship docked here.</p>
    <p>They were taken di­rectly from the air­port to the ship in a ded­i­cated ve­hi­cle and did not leave the ship sub­se­quently, MOH said.</p>
    <p>All im­ported cases were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and tested pos­i­tive de­spite be­ing asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>Takashimay­a in Ngee Ann City, Don Don Donki in Square 2 @ Novena, Joeun Sa­lon in Far East Plaza and the Kushikatsu Tanaka res­tau­rant i n Mer­chant Court were also added yes­ter­day to a list of places vis­ited by i nfec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get peo­ple who were there to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases bring Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,866.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks, MOH said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
