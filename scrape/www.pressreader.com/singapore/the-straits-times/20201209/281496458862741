    <p>It’s be­gin­ning to look a lot like Christ­mas. The fes­tive lights are up, Christ­mas trees are be­ing snapped up and many are busy buy­ing gifts or mak­ing plans for their Christ­mas meals.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, some are plan­ning to have a greener Christ­mas by hav­ing a ve­gan or veg­e­tar­ian meal, and hav­ing plant-based meat.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, plant-based meat such as Im­pos­si­ble Burger, Be­yond Meat and Quorn have been gain­ing pop­u­lar­ity in Sin­ga­pore and other parts of the world. Such plant-based meat is usu­ally made from ex­tracted plant pro­tein or whey pro­tein, spices and bind­ing in­gre­di­ents. They are de­signed to look and taste like con­ven­tional meat.</p>
    <p>The sub­sti­tute meat mar­ket in the Asia-Pa­cific was worth $20.5 bil­lion last year, a rise of 4.75 per cent from the pre­vi­ous year, ac­cord­ing to mar­ket re­search firm Euromon­i­tor In­ter­na­tional. It is ex­pected to grow to $22.9 bil­lion this year.</p>
    <p>Data an­a­lyst Ika Bhagchan­dani is among those who will be in­cor­po­rat­ing plant-based foods at her Christ­mas gath­er­ing this year.</p>
    <p>She de­cided to give plant-based foods a try this year when she turned ve­gan after read­ing a book on fac­tory farm­ing. Apart from cook­ing tofu, tem­peh and veg­etable curry dishes, Ms Bhagchan­dani has also ex­per­i­mented with mak­ing ve­gan won­tons us­ing Im­pos­si­ble meat.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old, who posts photos and recipes of the ve­gan food she cooks on her In­sta­gram pro­file @bhagchan­danieatery, said: “I wanted to chal­lenge my­self to stay off meat and ex­plore other meat sub­sti­tutes that are sus­tain­able and free of an­i­mal cru­elty.”</p>
    <p>Mr Goh Qiu Le, a di­eti­tian at Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (CGH), said an in­creas­ing em­pha­sis on cur­tail­ing cli­mate change has shone the spot­light on sus­tain­able food pro­duc­tion prac­tices to meet the de­mands of a grow­ing pop­u­la­tion. “As such, the meat­less move­ment is gain­ing trac­tion and more com­pa­nies are mak­ing plant­based meat al­ter­na­tives avail­able for the masses,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other op­tion is meat that is an­i­mal-friendly.</p>
    <p>Last week, Sin­ga­pore ap­proved the sale of a cul­tured meat prod­uct here – a world’s first. The chicken bites by Cal­i­for­nian start-up Eat Just are made by cul­tur­ing an­i­mal cells in biore­ac­tors in­stead of rear­ing an­i­mals on farms.</p>
    <p>For Christ­mas, Ms Bhagchan­dani will be pre­par­ing an all-ve­gan feast for a small gath­er­ing with her friends at home.</p>
    <p>The menu will fea­ture pump­ki­nap­ple cream soup, Im­pos­si­ble Burger meat­loaf with roasted veg­eta­bles, mashed pota­toes and pecan pie.</p>
    <p>Apart from eth­i­cal rea­sons such as stand­ing against fac­tory farm­ing and an­i­mal cru­elty, plant-based food ed­u­ca­tor Anna Wojtkowska said the main ben­e­fits of plant­based meat are en­vi­ron­men­tal.</p>
    <p>“Pro­duc­ing plant-based meat in­cludes wa­ter sav­ings of up to 99 per cent com­pared with the equiv­a­lent of beef pro­duc­tion. Plant­based meat also gen­er­ates up to 90 per cent less green­house gas emis­sions and uses 90 per cent less land space than their meat coun­ter­parts,” she noted.</p>
    <p>Plant-based meat al­ter­na­tives also en­able peo­ple to re­duce their in­take of an­i­mal-based prod­ucts or tran­si­tion to a veg­e­tar­ian diet.</p>
    <p>Dr Naras Lap­sys, a con­sul­tant di­eti­tian at The Well­ness Clinic, said: “There are those who want to cut down on their in­take of meat be­cause of the high choles­terol, and with heart dis­eases be­ing one of the top causes of death in Sin­ga­pore, more peo­ple may look at in­cor­po­rat­ing plant-based meat in their diet.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, plant-based foods are not nec­es­sar­ily health­ier.</p>
    <p>Dr Lap­sys noted that such foods are “highly pro­cessed” and can be very un­healthy. Pro­cessed foods have been linked to ill­nesses such as can­cer and high blood pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said meat­less al­ter­na­tives are de­signed to em­u­late the taste, con­sis­tency and even nu­tri­ent pro­file of meat, and they may con­tain high amounts of sat­u­rated fat and sodium, which are detri­men­tal to heart health.</p>
    <p>Ms Wojtkowska said that while plant-based meat is a great source of pro­tein, it is ad­vis­able to con­sider its fat and sodium con­tent.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, she said, a beef patty from Be­yond Meat weigh­ing about 113g has 390mg of sodium com­pared with 81mg in the same amount of raw lean beef, while an Im­pos­si­ble Burger con­tains more sat­u­rated fat than reg­u­lar meat, likely due to the co­conut oil in its in­gre­di­ent list.</p>
    <p>To en­joy a health­ier fes­tive sea­son, she sug­gested us­ing tofu and tem­peh in Christ­mas dishes such as stuffed a la turkey, tem­peh glazed a la ham and in­dul­gent choco­late tofu mousse.</p>
    <p>“Tofu and tem­peh are gen­er­ally far less pro­cessed and con­tain lit­tle fat or calo­ries,” she said. “Plant-based Christ­mas dishes can also be made from lo­cal prod­ucts such as jack­fruit, which can be cooked into a de­li­cious roast that would im­press most meat eaters.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mag­dalin Cheong, who heads CGH’s di­etet­ics depart­ment, said health­ier and palat­able veg­e­tar­ian dishes for Christ­mas in­clude pump­kin or sweet potato soup, spinach quiche or cau­li­flower cheese and potato bake, roast pota­toes, roasted mixed veg­eta­bles, boiled brus­sel sprouts and fresh salad.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she said: “Eat­ing a few health­ier meals at Christ­mas is not go­ing to make much dif­fer­ence to a per­son’s health if he does not eat healthily on a reg­u­lar ba­sis. Hav­ing a bal­anced and health­ier diet is a jour­ney and must be sus­tain­able.”</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­ing plant­based meat in­cludes wa­ter sav­ings of up to 99 per cent com­pared with the equiv­a­lent of beef pro­duc­tion. Plant-based meat also gen­er­ates up to 90 per cent less green­house gas emis­sions and uses 90 per cent less land space than their meat coun­ter­parts.</p>
