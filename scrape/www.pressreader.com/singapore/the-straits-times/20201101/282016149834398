    <p>The first three nom­i­nees for The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year award this year all have one thing in com­mon – a can-do at­ti­tude and a bound­less de­sire to help any­one in need.</p>
    <p>The first, 81-year-old re­tired fac­tory worker Lim Ee Chin, leapt into ac­tion and helped put out a fire in her neigh­bour’s flat.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond nom­i­nee, so­cial en­tre­pre­neur Cai Yinzhou, 30, co­founded a group to sup­port mi­grant work­ers af­fected by cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The third nom­i­nee, re­tired cleaner Zulk­i­fli At­nawi, 60, and the Project Hills ini­tia­tive founded by his four chil­dren, pro­vide out­reach and fi­nan­cial help to rental flat res­i­dents af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The award, now into its sixth year, is sup­ported by in­vest­ment bank UBS Sin­ga­pore. It recog­nises</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans whose ex­tra­or­di­nary ac­tions im­proved some­one’s life or the larger com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The award also recog­nises Sin­ga­pore­ans who have put the coun­try on the world map or per­se­vered to over­come great ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Straits Times edi­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is also edi­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group, said: “In this very chal­leng­ing year, all the more we need he­roes to in­spire us and lift spir­its. The first three nom­i­nees this year do just that. They have risen to the chal­lenge in a cri­sis, ex­tended a hand to help oth­ers in need and put the wel­fare of the com­mu­nity ahead of them­selves.”</p>
    <p>“We will be on the look­out for more of them as we firm up the list of this year’s nom­i­nees for Sin­ga­porean of the Year,” he added. “We wel­come all sug­ges­tions from Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Nom­i­nees must be Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens who made the news this year. They can be nom­i­nated ei­ther as in­di­vid­u­als or a group. Nom­i­na­tions close on Dec 15 and the rest of the short­listed can­di­dates will be un­veiled be­tween now and De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>There will then be two weeks of pub­lic vot­ing, and the out­come will be used as a ref­er­ence by the judges to make a fi­nal de­ci­sion on the win­ner in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, who is the pa­tron of the award, will be the guest of hon­our at the pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­mony in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Last year, the award went to As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Angie Chew, who started Brahm Cen­tre in 2012 to pro­vide free health ed­u­ca­tion, other ser­vices like be­friend­ing, coun­selling and de­men­tia-screen­ing for frail and lonely se­niors.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous re­cip­i­ents in­clude Ms Siti Noor Mas­tura, who co-founded non-profit group In­ter­faith Youth Cir­cle; HealthServ­e, which pro­vides mi­grant work­ers with af­ford­able health­care, and its co-founder Goh Wei Leong; Olympic gold medal­list Joseph School­ing and his par­ents Colin and May; and</p>
    <p>Madam Noriza A. Man­sor, a sales as­sis­tant who helped a se­nior who soiled him­self in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean of the Year will re­ceive a tro­phy and $20,000, pre­sented by UBS, which has sup­ported the award since its in­au­gu­ra­tion. Other in­di­vid­u­als or groups cho­sen as fi­nal­ists by the panel of judges will re­ceive $5,000 each.</p>
    <p>The win­ner will also re­ceive a five-night stay in any of Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels’ global prop­er­ties, while the other fi­nal­ists will get a three-night stay.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines is also spon­sor­ing a pair of busi­ness class tick­ets for the Sin­ga­porean of the Year, and a pair of econ­omy class tick­ets for the other fi­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>A panel of judges com­pris­ing Straits Times edi­tors, UBS rep­re­sen­ta­tives and in­di­vid­u­als who have made their mark in var­i­ous fields will help se­lect and rec­om­mend de­serv­ing can­di­dates be­fore pick­ing the Sin­ga­porean of the Year.</p>
    <p>IN­SPI­RA­TIONAL FIG­URES</p>
    <p>In this very chal­leng­ing year, all the more we need he­roes to in­spire us and lift spir­its. The first three nom­i­nees this year do just that. They have risen to the chal­lenge in a cri­sis, ex­tended a hand to help oth­ers in need and put the wel­fare of the com­mu­nity ahead of them­selves.</p>
