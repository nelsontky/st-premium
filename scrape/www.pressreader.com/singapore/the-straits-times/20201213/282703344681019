    <p>Rapid tech­no­log­i­cal dis­rup­tion in re­cent years has caused dis­rup­tion and dec­i­ma­tion of jobs across in­dus­tries, but it has also cre­ated new ones. The Covid-19 cri­sis has has­tened the changes.</p>
    <p>Reskilling has greater ex­i­gency than ever – and this is true for work­ers of all ages.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers who were dis­placed now will likely have to move into other roles within the same sec­tor or into other sec­tors, which will re­quire pick­ing up new skills, said Mr Ja­son Tay, di­rec­tor of en­ter­prise pro­grammes di­vi­sion at Work­force Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Global mega­trends such as au­to­ma­tion and new ways of work­ing are erod­ing tra­di­tional skills and lead­ing to job losses, said Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Des­mond Choo.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, work­ers are no longer needed to man as­sem­bly lines as pro­duc­tion op­er­a­tions are au­to­mated. But they can learn to op­er­ate ma­chines that over­see the au­to­ma­tion process in­stead.</p>
    <p>“It is crit­i­cal that our work­ers ac­quire new skills – that is, reskill – or en­hance their ex­ist­ing skill sets – which means up­skilling – in or­der to adapt to these rapidly chang­ing con­di­tions,” said Mr Choo, who also chairs the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Man­power.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said reskilling can mean chang­ing ca­reer paths to a new sec­tor, but it could also en­tail a less rad­i­cal move to a new job in the same sec­tor, or a re­de­ploy­ment within the same or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This can bring dif­fer­ent chal­lenges, de­pend­ing on an em­ployee’s age. Younger work­ers may be able to eas­ily adapt to a new in­dus­try and may not have ma­jor fi­nan­cial com­mit­ments such as a mort­gage or chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion to con­sider when mak­ing de­ci­sions about switch­ing ca­reers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) se­nior ca­reer coach Eve­lyn Tay noted that with less work ex­pe­ri­ence, they may find it hard to iden­tify skills gaps that need plug­ging.</p>
    <p>Some se­niors, on the other hand, may not be fa­mil­iar with avail­able train­ing cour­ses or face a lan­guage bar­rier when at­tend­ing train­ing, said Mr Choo.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the ones most in need of reskilling, but who may find it the most dif­fi­cult to do so, are mid­dleaged work­ers in their 40s and 50s.</p>
    <p>Mr Choo said mid­dle-aged work­ers, es­pe­cially pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives, tend to be more vul­ner­a­ble in the labour mar­ket be­cause of their higher fi­nan­cial bur­dens, a plateau­ing ca­reer and job growth, and com­pe­ti­tion from younger or for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>At the same time, they risk hav­ing their skills be­come re­dun­dant as it has been years since they left for­mal ed­u­ca­tion. But though it is im­por­tant for them to reskill, some may find it daunt­ing to learn new skills or switch in­dus­tries, or may be hard-pressed to find the time to go for train­ing.</p>
    <p>One so­lu­tion is for busy pro­fes­sion­als to make use of on­line ma­te­rial to learn on the go, Mr Choo sug­gested.</p>
    <p>When think­ing about reskilling, peo­ple should take stock of their fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion and know how much they can in­vest in it, whether it is for paid cour­ses or in terms of go­ing with­out a salary, or get­ting only a train­ing al­lowance.</p>
    <p>Know­ing how long the sav­ings will last will also help with plan­ning if it may mean re­sign­ing from a job to go for train­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay rec­om­mends that ma­ture work­ers have a frank con­ver­sa­tion with fam­ily mem­bers to bet­ter plan their fi­nances and make any re­quired ad­just­ments be­fore em­bark­ing on reskilling.</p>
    <p>There are a myr­iad of op­tions for</p>
    <p>those keen to in­vest in learn­ing new skills, with dif­fer­ent cost and time com­mit­ments needed. These in­clude fur­ther stud­ies in in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, full-time or part-time cour­ses by pri­vate com­pa­nies and in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions, and free on­line cour­ses.</p>
    <p>There are also gov­ern­ment schemes aimed at eas­ing the tran­si­tion for work­ers switch­ing roles or in­dus­tries. Sev­eral are tar­geted specif­i­cally at ma­ture work­ers or mid-ca­reer switch­ers, such as pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes and the TechSkills Ac­cel­er­a­tor Mid-Ca­reer Ad­vance pro­gramme which was launched this year.</p>
    <p>The SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age rolled out amid the pan­demic has com­pany at­tach­ment and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties tar­geted at mid-ca­reer work­ers. A train­ing al­lowance is pro­vided.</p>
    <p>It may be pos­si­ble to use Skill­sFu­ture Credit or, if the worker is a union mem­ber, the Union Train­ing As­sis­tance Pro­gramme fund­ing, to off­set fees for el­i­gi­ble cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Tap the ca­reer coaches at WSG and NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute for ad­vice and help with iden­ti­fy­ing the most ap­pro­pri­ate grants and schemes to help de­fray train­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Reskillers may worry about whether their ef­forts will pay off in the job hunt. The good news is, nearly nine in 10 em­ploy­ers sur­veyed by NTUC Learn­ingHub re­cently are open or some­what open to hir­ing peo­ple with no rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence as long as they have un­der­gone in­dus­try-rel­e­vant skills train­ing.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als said most em­ploy­ers or HR prac­ti­tion­ers are will­ing to hire some­one with no prior ex­pe­ri­ence in the in­dus­try but with some work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, pos­si­bly in an ad­ja­cent field, to be reskilled.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers tend to pre­fer hir­ing can­di­dates who can hit the ground run­ning, but this is chang­ing due to short­ages of lo­cal work­ers and fund­ing for in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions to sup­port reskilling, said Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem. “Com­pa­nies are more open to con­sid­er­ing reskilled can­di­dates and giv­ing them the rel­e­vant op­por­tu­ni­ties and ex­po­sure to con­trib­ute and grow in the new role,” she said.</p>
