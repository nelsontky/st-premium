    <p>A re­cent visit to a mall made me re­alise how ef­fi­cient the build­ing man­age­ment was in im­ple­ment­ing safe en­try mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of en­tries/ex­its were closed with per­haps only one or two door­ways left open for ac­cess.</p>
    <p>After I had com­pleted run­ning my er­rands, I tried to exit the mall but found one exit after an­other closed with no se­cu­rity per­son­nel from whom I could seek help. I lit­er­ally felt trapped.</p>
    <p>This led me to won­der what would hap­pen in the event of a fire.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the build­ing man­age­ment had al­ready thought this through.</p>
    <p>But I would feel re­as­sured if it or the au­thor­i­ties were to shed light on how all of these locked ex­its would be opened safely and, more im­por­tantly, quickly in the event of a fire.</p>
    <p>If there is no plan yet, it would cer­tainly be a case of a tragedy wait­ing to hap­pen in try­ing to pre­vent an­other.</p>
