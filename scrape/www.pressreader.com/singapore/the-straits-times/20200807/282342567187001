    <p>For her de­signs, Cara Chi­ang, 27, imag­ined what it was like for her great-grand­par­ents – the founders of her­itage menswear tai­lor CYC – to brave stormy seas when they were smug­gled into Sin­ga­pore on a boat decades ago.</p>
    <p>They had fled to Sin­ga­pore from Shang­hai dur­ing the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion in search of a bet­ter life.</p>
    <p>“They were sneaked over. My grandma said it was a tough two-week jour­ney on the boat,” says Chi­ang, who joined the fam­ily busi­ness in 2017 as the prod­uct de­vel­op­ment and mar­ket­ing man­ager. In Sin­ga­pore, they faced more hard­ship start­ing CYC from the ground up in 1935. “But they made it,” Chi­ang says.</p>
    <p>Though she has de­signed for CYC in the past, this is her first time tak­ing part in a run­way com­pe­ti­tion. She jumped at the theme, be­liev­ing it was per­fect in telling the her­itage brand’s story.</p>
    <p>She re­searched life in 1930s Sin­ga­pore, want­ing the col­lec­tion to cap­ture the mix of de­spair and hope faced by an im­mi­grant in those days.</p>
    <p>Off the boat, her re­search found, work and liv­ing con­di­tions were tough and peo­ple turned to vices. “I thought of their pain and dark­ness and how they even­tu­ally got out of it. I be­lieve it was hope of brighter hori­zons that kept them go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Her de­sign con­cept took a som­bre turn in late June when her fa­ther died of a heart at­tack. “I was go­ing through a very dark pe­riod and it made me think of the un­cer­tainty and dark­ness (my an­ces­tors) must have felt in the past.”</p>
    <p>Her five menswear looks re­flect a jour­ney in that state of mind as well as the rocky voy­age taken by an im­mi­grant. Two – de­signed with a dark pal­ette and storm mo­tifs – will rep­re­sent de­spair and sor­row, while the rest em­body hope, with sun­rise hues for “the calm af­ter the storm”.</p>
    <p>With this col­lec­tion, Chi­ang also pays trib­ute to her grand­mother, Madam Chan May Lee, who was taken un­der the wing of the founders them­selves, brought to Sin­ga­pore when she was 12 and trained as a tai­lor. She ended up work­ing for CYC for 65 years, ris­ing to be­come the com­pany’s pro­duc­tion man­ager and even marrying into the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Madam Chan died last week­end at the age of 88. Her health took a sud­den down­turn af­ter Chi­ang’s fa­ther died.</p>
    <p>It has been the cra­zi­est year of her life, says Chi­ang. But like her an­ces­tors, she will weather the storm – for her grand­mother, who had been chuffed to hear she got into the com­pe­ti­tion fi­nals. “I have to keep go­ing be­cause that’s what my grandma told me be­fore she died,” she says. “She told me to do my job well.”</p>
    <p>For the first time, Nida Tahir Sha­h­er­yar, 35, has been re­ceiv­ing re­quests to do sim­pler pieces.</p>
    <p>It is eas­ier said than done, given that the Abu Dhabi-born de­signer has built her la­bel Nida Shay on in­tri­cately em­broi­dered oc­ca­sion­wear. Many of her cus­tomers go to her for her cus­tom em­broi­dery work.</p>
    <p>A main­stay on the lo­cal fash­ion scene and fash­ion week cir­cuit, Sha­h­er­yar de­buted her la­bel at Sin­ga­pore Fash­ion Week in 2016.</p>
    <p>She has been feel­ing unin­spired dur­ing the pandemic. “But it’s been quite quiet in the lo­cal scene even be­fore Covid-19,” says the de­signer, who has lived here since 2009.</p>
    <p>Miss­ing the rush of fash­ion shows and travel, she saw Sin­ga­pore Sto­ries as the per­fect op­por­tu­nity to break out of her cre­ative rut.</p>
    <p>For her de­signs, she took in­spi­ra­tion from the “full cir­cle” evo­lu­tion of women’s cloth­ing, play­ing with var­ied sil­hou­ettes like puff shoul­ders, mod­ern sari drapes and cheongsam col­lars.</p>
    <p>Fas­ci­nated by the par­al­lels be­tween how women of the past used to re­vere their tai­lors for cus­tom pieces and the be­spoke na­ture of her own work to­day, she will be weav­ing in her sig­na­ture gold em­broi­dery – with mo­tifs inspired by lo­cal botany and arte­facts from the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum’s col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Her first look fea­tures em­broi­dered Ori­ole birds com­monly seen in Sin­ga­pore, which her two sons aged eight and 10 keep spot­ting at their house.</p>
    <p>Tough times or not, a de­signer should have a dis­tinct iden­tity yet be com­mer­cially vi­able, says Sha­h­er­yar, who is ex­plor­ing mak­ing ca­sual pieces that still have the Nida Shay touch to answer the de­mand. “I’ve had good re­sponse with lo­cal con­sumers. I’ve cre­ated a niche in the mar­ket and peo­ple ap­pre­ci­ate that they can cus­tomise it to tell their own sto­ries.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, she once em­broi­dered the im­age of a bride and groom on each side of a bomber jacket. When the jacket was zipped up, the cou­ple “came to­gether”.</p>
    <p>“When you cus­tomise things, it’s a lit­tle bit more sell­able. Peo­ple un­der­stand and are will­ing to in­vest in it,” she adds. “I’m lucky that way.”</p>
    <p>She is grate­ful for TaFF’s sup­port and com­pe­ti­tions like Sin­ga­pore Sto­ries. “I hope my par­tic­i­pa­tion will in­spire oth­ers to con­tinue to chal­lenge them­selves and re­alise the im­por­tance of stay­ing rel­e­vant.”</p>
