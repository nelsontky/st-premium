    <p>Trust is Sin­ga­pore’s most valu­able do­mes­tic cur­rency, and one that a new gen­er­a­tion of po­lit­i­cal lead­ers step­ping up to lead the na­tion must work dou­bly hard to mint.</p>
    <p>Trust lu­bri­cates in­ter­per­sonal ties and in­ter-group in­ter­ac­tions. It is the ba­sis on which the in­cum­bent Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) has ruled Sin­ga­pore without a break since 1959, win­ning elec­tion af­ter elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Trust is the artery along which feel­ings of sol­i­dar­ity run. Without trust, there is no feel­ing of be­long­ing, of home, of com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>With trust, there is com­mit­ment, to each other, with each other. Specif­i­cally, trust between peo­ple and gov­ern­ment is the com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage of the Sin­ga­pore sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Two episodes, this week, prompted this re­flec­tion on trust.</p>
    <p>MISDIAGNOS­IS AND TREAT­MENT</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment started live-stream­ing its ses­sions on Mon­day and I watched Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health, Dr Koh Poh Koon, an­swer ques­tions about the more than 200 breast cancer pa­tients at Khoo Teck Puat Hospi­tal (KTPH) who had been mis­di­ag­nosed to have the HER-2 pos­i­tive vari­ant of the cancer. Nearly half of them went on to re­ceive treat­ment when they were in fact false pos­i­tives (they were told they had it when they did not).</p>
    <p>Dr Koh said pa­tients would be re­funded in full for their un­nec­es­sary treat­ment – likely to cost tens of thou­sands of dol­lars be­cause the drug used to treat HER-2 breast cancer, her­ceptin, is ex­pen­sive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his ex­pla­na­tion in Par­lia­ment ap­peared to down­play the sever­ity of the episode. For one thing, he de­scribed the misdiagnos­is that led to the wrong clas­si­fi­ca­tion of breast cancer pa­tients as “not nec­es­sar­ily a bad thing”.</p>
    <p>His rea­son­ing was that the pa­tients had orig­i­nally been told they had HER-2 pos­i­tive breast cancer, which is typ­i­cally more ag­gres­sive with poorer prog­no­sis and been given treat­ment for it. But they were later found to have breast cancer that was HER-2 neg­a­tive. Dr Koh’s point was that it was bet­ter to be re­clas­si­fied into the group with the bet­ter prog­no­sis.</p>
    <p>On the side ef­fects, he de­scribed them thus: “Di­ar­rhoea, fever or chills, they do not have long-term con­se­quences. They are not long last­ing.” About 3 per cent to 4 per cent of pa­tients may suf­fer heart prob­lems, he had also added.</p>
    <p>What was no­table though was what Dr Koh did not say about the whole episode. He did not apol­o­gise for the hospi­tal’s mis­take. His com­ments came across as clin­i­cal, lack­ing em­pa­thy for the pa­tients mis­di­ag­nosed.</p>
    <p>Most wor­ry­ing to me is that his re­marks ap­peared to down­play the sever­ity of the mis­take and did not come to grips with more se­ri­ous and long-term ef­fects of treat­ment for HER-2 pos­i­tive can­cers, es­pe­cially po­ten­tial heart prob­lems that af­fect a small mi­nor­ity of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>I know a lit­tle about this be­cause I was a breast cancer pa­tient who was HER-2 pos­i­tive. I was di­ag­nosed in 2002 in Bos­ton where I was do­ing my master’s.</p>
    <p>I was treated with a drug called her­ceptin, as part of a clin­i­cal trial at that time to test it for early-stage breast cancer. It has since been proven ef­fec­tive and is com­monly used for HER-2 pos­i­tive cancer treat­ment to­day.</p>
    <p>While Dr Koh spoke of fever and chills, any num­ber of ar­ti­cles on­line will tell you that heart fail­ure is the most se­ri­ous risk for her­ceptin.</p>
    <p>I re­call how care­fully my med­i­cal team in Bos­ton mon­i­tored my heart func­tion. It did de­cline, but bounced back af­ter treat­ment.</p>
    <p>An ar­ti­cle on­line in the jour­nal Ther­a­peu­tic Ad­vances in Drug Safety in 2014, summed it up, re­fer­ring to the sci­en­tific name for her­ceptin: “Trastuzuma­b treat­ment is gen­er­ally well tol­er­ated with the po­ten­tial for trastuzuma­b-in­duced car­diotox­i­c­ity as the mor­bid­ity of pri­mary con­cern.” (Trans­lated: Her­ceptin treat­ment is gen­er­ally well tol­er­ated, with pos­si­ble her­ceptin-in­duced heart prob­lems the most wor­ry­ing side ef­fect).</p>
    <p>A 2016 re­view of 20 years of her­ceptin us­age in Esmo Open, the on­line, peer-re­viewed jour­nal of the Euro­pean So­ci­ety for Med­i­cal On­col­ogy, said “car­diotox­i­c­ity re­mains a sig­nif­i­cant prob­lem in clin­i­cal prac­tice that is likely to in­crease as new agents are ap­proved and ex­po­sure times in­crease through im­proved pa­tients’ sur­vival”.</p>
    <p>Nor are the side ef­fects and im­pact nec­es­sar­ily tran­sient. The same 2014 ar­ti­cle re­ported that “episodes of trastuzuma­b-in­duced car­diotox­i­c­ity may have long-last­ing ef­fects on car­diac health”.</p>
    <p>This led me to won­der how many of the roughly 90 pa­tients who re­ceived un­nec­es­sary treat­ment ended up with heart weak­ness as a re­sult. Even if num­bers are small, say, a hand­ful, the Gov­ern­ment owes it to them to take care of their med­i­cal needs long term.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh did say in Par­lia­ment that KTPH will pro­vide “any clin­i­cal and fi­nan­cial sup­port to the af­fected pa­tients in­clud­ing on­go­ing or fol­low-up treat­ment” that may be needed from the ad­di­tional treat­ment.</p>
    <p>While re­search and lon­gi­tu­di­nal stud­ies are on­go­ing on the long-term ef­fects of her­ceptin’s ef­fect on the heart, I can vouch that the psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of treat­ment can be life­long.</p>
    <p>When I had a heart scare last month due to chest tight­ness while cy­cling that sent me to the car­di­ol­o­gist, I im­me­di­ately thought back to my cancer treat­ment and won­dered if her­ceptin could have such a long tail ef­fect. (Luck­ily, it was a false alarm).</p>
    <p>As for the cost of treat­ment, be­ing on her­ceptin ex­tended my breast cancer treat­ment by nearly a year and cost my in­surer and com­pany more than $40,000 just for the drug mi­nus other clinic costs. I took med­i­cal leave for a year. On top of in­con­ve­nience and anx­i­ety, fac­tor in time costs and salary for­gone.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to Dr Koh, it was hard to avoid the im­pres­sion that he was paint­ing a pic­ture of the misdiagnos­is as not that big a deal. His ex­pla­na­tions: Lab er­rors do hap­pen; it was bet­ter to get over-treated for cancer than un­der-treated; side ef­fects for the treat­ment were not last­ing and not se­ri­ous; and ex­plain­ing that most of the pa­tients had to go to hospi­tal any­way for other forms of chemo­ther­apy given in con­junc­tion with her­ceptin, so it was not that in­con­ve­nient.</p>
    <p>Per­haps be­cause of my own med­i­cal his­tory, I can em­pathise with how emo­tional and in­con­ve­nient a wrong di­ag­no­sis and un­nec­es­sary treat­ment can be for the pa­tients in­volved. They suf­fered from a bad mis­take made by the hospi­tal. Hence, I found Dr Koh’s ex­pla­na­tions un­sat­is­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, leadership means tak­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity for what goes wrong within your am­bit even when you are not per­son­ally in­volved. Most of all, leadership means tak­ing on board your most vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers’ con­cerns (in this case, the mis­di­ag­nosed pa­tients) and do­ing due dili­gence to make sure they are given jus­tice and prop­erly cared for. Only such acts can ame­lio­rate the dam­age done and help build trust again.</p>
    <p>To be fair to Dr Koh, per­haps he was ad­vised that heart prob­lems may af­fect just a small per­cent­age of pa­tients and he did not see a need to probe it.</p>
    <p>But within the hospi­tal and min­istry, some of­fi­cials would have known of the sever­ity and po­ten­tial long-term na­ture of at least this side ef­fect – no mat­ter how few peo­ple it might af­fect. If so, it is dis­ap­point­ing that this was not com­mu­ni­cated pub­licly. My hope is that at least in com­mu­ni­ca­tions with the pa­tients in­volved, the risks were made clearer.</p>
    <p>What would have strength­ened trust? A clear apol­ogy. While the KTPH chief ex­ec­u­tive did apol­o­gise, the mag­ni­tude of the mis­take – af­fect­ing more than</p>
    <p>200, ex­tend­ing over years, caus­ing many to have un­nec­es­sary treat­ment – re­quires some­one se­nior like Dr Koh, rep­re­sent­ing the health au­thor­i­ties, to apol­o­gise, in my view.</p>
    <p>What else might have helped? State­ments that show the Gov­ern­ment un­der­stood the sever­ity of the mis­take. Words and ac­tions to show em­pa­thy with the in­con­ve­nience and suf­fer­ing caused by the un­nec­es­sary treat­ment. A com­mit­ment to make things right by tak­ing care of long-term med­i­cal con­se­quences for the pa­tients. A re­view of pro­ce­dures to see what went wrong and pre­vent re­cur­rence. At least the last two were promised, al­though no de­tails were given.</p>
    <p>TRACETO­GETHER AND PRI­VACY</p>
    <p>A day af­ter Dr Koh’s Par­lia­ment state­ment on the misdiagnos­is, it was the turn of For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan, who is also Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive that is re­spon­si­ble for the roll-out of the TraceTo­gether con­tact trac­ing app and to­ken, to be in the spot­light.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan had said last June that TraceTo­gether data would be used “purely for con­tact trac­ing, period”. But on Mon­day, it was dis­closed in Par­lia­ment that in fact, the po­lice could ac­cess such data in the course of a crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion. This is pro­vided for un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC), which gives the po­lice broad pow­ers to ac­cess all kinds of in­for­ma­tion in­clud­ing doc­u­ments and phone and bank­ing records, for their in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan ad­mit­ted on Tues­day that “frankly, I had not thought of the CPC, when I spoke ear­lier”.</p>
    <p>When asked by an op­po­si­tion MP whether he was apol­o­gis­ing for his ear­lier words, Dr Balakr­ish­nan de­murred. He said: “I am ob­ses­sively con­cerned with ac­cu­racy, need­less to say, ab­so­lute ad­her­ence to hon­esty. And that means over the years, from time to time, when I have mis­spo­ken, I have said so.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never shied away from say­ing so be­cause, as I said, it is far more im­por­tant to main­tain trust. And I might be right or I might be wrong or I might have mis­taken some­thing or over­looked some­thing, but rest as­sured when I dis­cover it, I will say so, and to the best ex­tent pos­si­ble, we will find a so­lu­tion to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to him dur­ing the live stream­ing of the de­bate as MPs rose to grill him, I craned my ears to hear the words of apol­ogy that never came.</p>
    <p>To me, the is­sue is not over whether the po­lice should have ac­cess to TraceTo­gether data; nor is it about the bal­ance between per­sonal pri­vacy and public health. Pri­vacy ad­vo­cates aside, I think most Sin­ga­pore­ans don’t have ma­jor prob­lems with the po­lice ac­cess­ing prox­im­ity data from their TraceTo­gether to­ken or app for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions. I, for one, have no ob­jec­tion. In­stead, the up­set is over prom­ises made and bro­ken.</p>
    <p>In say­ing TraceTo­gether data will be used only for con­tact trac­ing, Dr Balakr­ish­nan made a prom­ise to the na­tion that can­not be kept.</p>
    <p>If that as­sur­ance was false be­cause it was based on par­tial in­for­ma­tion, he should just say so, apol­o­gise and move on. Given he had ear­lier spo­ken dur­ing a live press con­fer­ence, in the mid­dle of a global coron­avirus pan­demic up­end­ing lives, it was a hu­man mis­take, well-in­ten­tioned, for­giv­able.</p>
    <p>An apol­ogy would re­mind Sin­ga­pore­ans that min­is­ters’ words mat­ter and are to be taken se­ri­ously, al­though they may some­times make mis­takes and speak out of turn. That kind of bro­ken trust can be reme­died; be more care­ful to check facts and avoid glib as­sur­ances, un­less ab­so­lutely sure.</p>
    <p>To be sure, the trust cit­i­zens have in gov­ern­ment is founded on much more than words. To win trust, a gov­ern­ment must first be com­pe­tent and strive to meet the needs and as­pi­ra­tions of peo­ple. It must also have in­tegrity, so that peo­ple know it is truth­ful and not cor­rupt. Th­ese are traits the PAP Gov­ern­ment has con­sis­tently shown over five decades, in­clud­ing in the way it has man­aged the pan­demic. So I am not sug­gest­ing that apolo­gies alone build trust.</p>
    <p>But when things go wrong, it is im­por­tant that the right words are said and the right ac­tions made.</p>
    <p>Trust is a valu­able com­mod­ity, hard won, eas­ily lost. How lead­ers deal with mis­takes can strengthen it, or erode it.</p>
