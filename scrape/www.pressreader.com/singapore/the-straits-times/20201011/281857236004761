    <p>As Barry County sher­iff Dar Leaf spoke at a small protest in May in Grand Rapids, Michi­gan, against State Gover­nor Gretchen Whit­mer’s stay-home or­ders amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, a burly man in civil­ian mili­tia garb armed with an as­sault ri­fle stood be­hind him.</p>
    <p>Wil­liam Null was one of at least three armed men at the event.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day night, the</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) ar­rested him, his brother Michael and sev­eral oth­ers, and charged them with pro­vid­ing sup­port for ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>Weapons charges were also filed. The FBI says the men were part of a self-or­gan­ised se­cret cell of mil­i­tants plan­ning to kid­nap Gover­nor Whit­mer – a Demo­crat – and over­throw the state govern­ment.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 13 have been ar­rested in what an­a­lysts say is the big­gest bust of a mili­tia in years.</p>
    <p>Amid po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural ten­sion in Amer­ica, white mili­tia are newly em­bold­ened. They have showed up fully armed in states such as Ken­tucky, Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin, some­times to “pro­tect” pro-Trump demon­stra­tors or fed­eral build­ings.</p>
    <p>And they are of­ten seem­ingly given a friendly pass by lo­cal po­lice, the le­gal con­text be­ing Amer­i­cans’ con­sti­tu­tional right to bear arms.</p>
    <p>Mili­tia have, in fact, been part of Amer­ica’s land­scape for gen­er­a­tions. But the au­dac­ity of the Michi­gan plot – the con­spir­a­tors dis­cussed tak­ing away Ms Whit­mer in a boat and blow­ing up a bridge to slow re­spond­ing po­lice – bodes ill for the US as it bar­rels towards a hotly con­tested elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has ap­peared am­biva­lent on the is­sue of white supremacy, had lit­tle sym­pa­thy for Ms Whit­mer.</p>
    <p>“Gover­nor Whit­mer of Michi­gan has done a ter­ri­ble job,” he tweeted last Thurs­day. “She locked down her state for ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>The Gover­nor said in an in­ter­view that Mr Trump was “giv­ing oxy­gen to the big­otry and hate we see on the march in our coun­try”.</p>
    <p>There is a smor­gas­bord of mili­tia groups in the US, rang­ing from white su­prem­a­cists to the anti-govern­ment type, of­ten with over­lap­ping or mixed ide­olo­gies. Not all are right wing, and there have been re­ports of left­ist groups arm­ing. An African Amer­i­can armed group was re­cently filmed by reporters in Ken­tucky.</p>
    <p>But the term “mili­tia” in Amer­ica refers specif­i­cally to white groups.</p>
    <p>The con­spir­a­tors in the Michi­gan plot re­port­edly also have links to ex­treme anti-govern­ment, anti-au­thor­ity “booga­loo” ide­ol­ogy. “Booga­loo” is slang for a civil war which they hope to trig­ger.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing signs are loud and clear. US Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity Act­ing Sec­re­tary Chad Wolf wrote in the agency’s threat as­sess­ment re­leased last week that he was “par­tic­u­larly con­cerned about white su­prem­a­cist vi­o­lent ex­trem­ists who have been ex­cep­tion­ally lethal in their ab­hor­rent, tar­geted at­tacks in re­cent years”.</p>
    <p>There is a “new ur­gency among white power ac­tivists”, Univer­sity of Chicago as­sis­tant professor Kath­leen Belew, an au­thor of a book on white power and paramil­i­taries, warned on Fri­day in the Wash­ing­ton Post.</p>
    <p>They have “cap­i­talised upon the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s many green lights, the anti-mask move­ment and the so­cial anx­i­eties of pan­demic and racial jus­tice protest to launch new cam­paigns of vi­o­lence”, she wrote.</p>
    <p>“This is a move­ment ex­pressly ded­i­cated to the vi­o­lent over­throw of the United States and the de­struc­tion of democ­racy and its in­sti­tu­tions.”</p>
    <p>Con­cern now cen­tres on what role mili­tias will play in a con­tested elec­tion. Mr Trump has said that the only way he will lose is if the elec­tion is rigged.</p>
    <p>Dr Mark Pit­cav­age, a se­nior re­search fel­low at the</p>
    <p>Anti-Defama­tion League’s Cen­tre on Ex­trem­ism, said: “There are a lot of dif­fer­ent the­o­ret­i­cal sit­u­a­tions in which vi­o­lence, to one de­gree or another, could emerge.</p>
    <p>“If Trump were to win the elec­tion... there might be less of a chance of vi­o­lence, although there are still sce­nar­ios for that.</p>
    <p>“If he were to lose in a re­ally large blowout, there might be some­what less of a chance for vi­o­lence, be­cause it would be harder to ar­gue for elec­tion fraud.</p>
    <p>“But any­where in be­tween, a Trump loss that is not nec­es­sar­ily a blowout loss, might well cause him to stren­u­ously con­test the le­git­i­macy of the elec­tion, or even refuse to ac­cept the re­sults, which could cause vi­o­lence on the part of some of his fol­low­ers, as well as re­ac­tive vi­o­lence on the other side.”</p>
