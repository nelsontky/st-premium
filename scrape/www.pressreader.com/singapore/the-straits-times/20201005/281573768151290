    <p>Many job seek­ers are now will­ing to ac­cept lower salaries be­cause of the tight em­ploy­ment mar­ket and dif­fi­cult eco­nomic con­di­tions brought on by the coro­n­avirus, ex­perts said. A Rand­stad Sin­ga­pore sur­vey in June and July found that over 50 per cent of re­spon­dents were will­ing to take on jobs with a lower salary.</p>
    <p>For­mer man­ager Lau Disan was do­ing well be­fore the pan­demic hit, but she has had to take a 50 per cent pay cut af­ter switch­ing from the rav­aged re­tail in­dus­try to early child­hood education.</p>
    <p>Her ex­pe­ri­ence is far from rare: Many job seek­ers are now will­ing to ac­cept lower salaries be­cause of the tight em­ploy­ment mar­ket and dif­fi­cult eco­nomic con­di­tions brought on by the coro­n­avirus, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Ms Lau, 46, was a re­tail man­ager for 15 years in the jew­ellery trade and earned over $4,000 a month. Now, she is a trainee child­care ed­u­ca­tor at Kin­der­land earn­ing half that.</p>
    <p>But she said the pay cut was ac­cept­able be­cause she is still un­der­go­ing train­ing un­der a Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme for preschool teach­ers.</p>
    <p>“I have zero prior ex­pe­ri­ence in early child­hood education,” she noted. “In or­der to get into the in­dus­try, I have to lower my ex­pec­ta­tions, ac­cept that I am learning from scratch and start afresh.</p>
    <p>“I ben­e­fit from work­ing half a day, and train­ing to gain a pro­fes­sional diploma at the same time. It is a win-win for em­ploy­ees and em­ploy­ers.”</p>
    <p>She added that she also sees it as an op­por­tu­nity to fur­ther her education while hav­ing a job and feed­ing her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>A Rand­stad Sin­ga­pore sur­vey in June and July found that over 50 per cent of re­spon­dents were will­ing to take on jobs with a lower salary.</p>
    <p>Rand­stad man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore Jaya Dass said: “It is clear that the ma­jor­ity of com­pa­nies have im­ple­mented some lev­els of cost-cut­ting mea­sures this year.</p>
    <p>“(There­fore) those who’ve been re­trenched or who are at height­ened risk of hav­ing their job scope changed sig­nif­i­cantly are vol­un­tar­ily re­vis­ing their salary ex­pec­ta­tions when look­ing for a new em­ployer.”</p>
    <p>She added that job seek­ers should not just fo­cus on salary or bonuses. “As long as the re­mu­ner­a­tion is fair and matches their ex­pec­ta­tions, can­di­dates should also try to con­sider the other ben­e­fits, such as health­care and work-from-home al­lowances.”</p>
    <p>Nearly 50 per cent of 373 re­spon­dents in a poll con­ducted by em­ploy­ment por­tal FastJobs in late Au­gust also said they were open to tak­ing po­si­tions of­fer­ing less than their last salary.</p>
    <p>It found that 39 per cent could stom­ach a drop of up to $200 a month, while 19 per cent were even open to ac­cept­ing a fluc­tu­a­tion of $1,000 or more.</p>
    <p>FastJobs gen­eral man­ager Lim Huis­han said: “Gen­er­ally, peo­ple are more flex­i­ble with salaries now as they recog­nise that it’s dif­fi­cult to get a job and also that in try­ing out a new in­dus­try, tak­ing less pay than their last (salary) may be nec­es­sary as their pre­vi­ous ex­pe­ri­ence is not as rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>“There are also fac­tors like age and per­sonal com­mit­ments that af­fect their will­ing­ness to take lower pay in ex­change for flexibilit­y.”</p>
    <p>Data from the plat­form showed that re­tail as­sis­tant was one of the roles with the great­est salary fluc­tu­a­tion in the pe­riod June to Au­gust, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, with the me­dian pay drop­ping $400.</p>
    <p>Cashiers’ me­dian salary dropped by $300, while sales ex­ec­u­tives saw a dip of $200.</p>
    <p>But the me­dian salary of driv­ers in­creased by $100 and that of pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ciates went up by $200.</p>
    <p>Adecco coun­try man­ager for Sin­ga­pore Be­tul Genc noted that can­di­dates for sales and mar­ket­ing po­si­tions would ac­cept an av­er­age pay re­duc­tion of 5 per cent while job seek­ers for white-col­lar roles in sup­ply chain and en­gi­neer­ing are open to a cut of 10 per cent in ex­change for sta­bil­ity and se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>But other industries might ac­tu­ally see base salaries rise.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing firms, for ex­am­ple, had to at­tract lo­cal tal­ent in the in­terim to re­place work­ers from Malaysia when bor­der re­stric­tions kicked in.</p>
    <p>Work­ers in sec­tors such as tech­nol­ogy, health­care and life sciences, ac­count­ing and fi­nance, and some sales and mar­ket­ing roles also might ex­pect salary hikes, said Ms Genc.</p>
    <p>Man­power Group Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager Linda Teo agreed that salaries have in­creased in sec­tors with grow­ing business de­mands, such as in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, but pay for jobs in tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity has dropped.</p>
    <p>Salaries in the oil and gas sec­tor have taken a hit as well due to the de­cline in air travel, she noted.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo said: “Job seek­ers with niche skill sets highly sought af­ter in the mar­ket con­tinue to ex­pect a higher pay but are more will­ing to ne­go­ti­ate the in­cre­ment per­cent­age.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, can­di­dates who are ap­ply­ing for cor­po­rate or rank-and­file roles are more flex­i­ble as there is more com­pe­ti­tion for those jobs.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als noted that mid-ca­reer switch­ers who have gone through past eco­nomic down­turns may ex­pect lower salaries than what they re­ceived at their pre­vi­ous jobs.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers should stay re­silient and flex­i­ble, view­ing their ca­reer as a long-term in­vest­ment, Ms Genc ad­vised.</p>
    <p>“While the salary might be slightly lower, the job will help you re-en­ter the work­force as quickly as pos­si­ble, ride you out of the cri­sis, and pro­fes­sion­ally, there may be other learning and de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties within the or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>She added that job seek­ers can pri­ori­tise the learning ex­pe­ri­ence as well. “We would also en­cour­age be­ing open to op­por­tu­ni­ties even if it is a tem­po­rary or con­tract role, as it helps with gain­ing new skills and ex­pe­ri­ence. The longer a job seeker re­mains out of work, the lower the bar­gain­ing power.”</p>
