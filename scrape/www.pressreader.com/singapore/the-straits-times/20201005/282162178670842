    <p>In the midst of the worst pub­lic health cri­sis in a gen­er­a­tion, a green rev­o­lu­tion is set to fur­ther shake up the world of fi­nance.</p>
    <p>In­vestors hold con­sid­er­able sway. As the world’s largest wealth man­ager, UBS re­cently made head­lines by an­nounc­ing that it would be the first ma­jor fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion to rec­om­mend sus­tain­able over tra­di­tional so­lu­tions for pri­vate clients in­vest­ing glob­ally. This sends a pow­er­ful sig­nal to firms that a sus­tain­able-minded ap­proach to oper­a­tions will in­creas­ingly be a nec­es­sary con­di­tion to at­tract cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Many in­di­vid­u­als are also mov­ing be­yond the ques­tion of why they should in­vest sus­tain­ably, to fo­cus on how to best in­cor­po­rate sus­tain­abil­ity con­sid­er­a­tions into their in­vest­ments in ways that sup­port their val­ues and ob­jec­tives be­sides fi­nan­cial re­turns.</p>
    <p>THE COVID-19 RECK­ON­ING</p>
    <p>This im­per­a­tive to pri­ori­tise sus­tain­abil­ity along with prof­its is gath­er­ing mo­men­tum. The pan­demic has shaken the world, and cap­i­tal mar­kets are tak­ing note. A case in point: Clean power stocks are up nearly 40 per cent this year glob­ally, while the ma­jor oil in­dexes are down by a sim­i­lar mag­ni­tude.</p>
    <p>In Europe, sus­tain­able eq­uity funds have out­paced their tra­di­tional peers for the first time ever this year. De­spite the pan­demic-driven mar­ket volatil­ity, as­set in­flows into sus­tain­able in­vest­ment funds in the first half of this year even matched the to­tal achieved in the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>As of June this year, more than US$1 tril­lion (S$1.36 tril­lion) was in­vested in ded­i­cated sus­tain­able in­vest­ment funds, a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in just 18 months from around US$600 bil­lion at the end of 2018.</p>
    <p>More­over, sus­tain­abil­ity is at the heart of the re­cov­ery plan for many gov­ern­ments. With in­ter­est rates near zero, fund­ing for green in­fras­truc­ture has surged.</p>
    <p>In the United States, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den wants to spend US$2 tril­lion de­car­bon­is­ing the econ­omy. The Euro­pean Union has ear­marked 30 per cent of its €880 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$1.4 tril­lion) Covid-19 re­cov­ery fund for cli­mate mea­sures. And in a sur­prise an­nounce­ment, China has com­mit­ted to achiev­ing car­bon neu­tral­ity by 2060 – a tar­get so am­bi­tious that, given China’s cur­rent emis­sion tra­jec­tory, it would re­quire a green rev­o­lu­tion to achieve.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Bud­get 2020 di­rected a large por­tion to cli­mate-re­lated ini­tia­tives in or­der to build a low-car­bon, low-emis­sions econ­omy. Bil­lions of dol­lars in fund­ing are be­ing di­rected into re­search for “Ur­ban So­lu­tions and Sus­tain­abil­ity”, build­ing elec­tric ve­hi­cle charg­ing points, re­bates and in­cen­tives for clean ve­hi­cles and ap­pli­ances, and long-term cli­mate change adap­tion.</p>
    <p>PORT­FO­LIO AND BE­LIEFS</p>
    <p>Post-pan­demic, the pro­found shift in so­ci­etal at­ti­tudes to­wards a sus­tain­able fu­ture will likely fur­ther drive changes in reg­u­la­tions and gov­ern­ment poli­cies.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank may con­sider changes to its as­set pur­chase poli­cies and hold­ings to favour those that align with its de­car­bon­i­sa­tion and cli­mate goals. It may ad­just some of its con­straints, take up a less neu­tral bench­mark, or even ex­clude cer­tain bonds that fund cli­mate-un­friendly projects.</p>
    <p>Across cap­i­tal mar­kets, com­pa­nies that score highly on en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance (ESG) per­for­mance cri­te­ria could in­creas­ingly re-rate against those that do not.</p>
    <p>As it stands, sus­tain­able in­vest­ing strate­gies have his­tor­i­cally de­liv­ered com­pa­ra­ble, if not bet­ter, fi­nan­cial per­for­mance than con­ven­tional equiv­a­lents. The MSCI ESG Lead­ers in­dexes out­per­formed in both this year’s sell-off and sub­se­quent rally, and green bonds have shown less volatil­ity this year than tra­di­tional bonds.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, the in­ter­sec­tion of height­ened con­sumer aware­ness and sus­tain­able in­vest­ing’s fo­cus on cut­ting-edge tech and in­no­va­tions to solve some of the world’s big­gest chal­lenges, in­clud­ing the tran­si­tion to a car­bon-neu­tral econ­omy, waste man­age­ment and sus­tain­able food trends, is set to present in­vestors with po­ten­tially at­trac­tive sec­u­lar op­por­tu­ni­ties in the years ahead.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, some of the world’s savvi­est in­vestors are lead­ing the charge. Nor­way’s US$1.2 tril­lion Gov­ern­ment Pen­sion Fund Global, and the world’s largest pool of re­tire­ment sav­ings, Ja­pan’s US$1.4 tril­lion Gov­ern­ment Pen­sion In­vest­ment Fund, are two of sus­tain­able in­vest­ment’s largest back­ers.</p>
    <p>Among global fam­ily of­fices sur­veyed by UBS, 73 per cent re­ported they are al­ready in­vest­ing at least some of their as­sets sus­tain­ably and nearly 40 per cent ex­pect to in­vest most of their as­sets sus­tain­ably within five years.</p>
    <p>HOW TO IN­VEST SUS­TAIN­ABLY</p>
    <p>In­vestors have a va­ri­ety of ways to gain ex­po­sure. One is to al­lo­cate cap­i­tal to a diver­si­fied multi-as­set port­fo­lio of key ESG themes and as­sets. An­other is to fo­cus di­rectly on the build­ing blocks of sus­tain­able ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>One key ex­am­ple of a build­ing block is an “ESG lead­ers” ap­proach, which in­vests in the eq­ui­ties of com­pa­nies that are more suc­cess­ful than com­peti­tors in man­ag­ing ESG chal­lenges in their in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>There are nu­mer­ous ESG lead­ers in­dexes in the mar­ket with pas­sive in­vest­ing op­tions through ex­change-traded funds that track them. Ex­am­ples in­clude the MSCI SRI and ESG in­dexes (which of­fer a va­ri­ety of method­olo­gies) and the Dow Jones Sus­tain­abil­ity in­dexes. All pur­sue the ap­proach of se­lect­ing firms with lead­ing ESG per­for­mance within each sec­tor.</p>
    <p>In the credit space, ma­jor build­ing blocks of sus­tain­able ini­tia­tives in­clude green bonds and mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment bank bonds. Both are debt in­stru­ments that raise money for cli­mate and en­vi­ron­men­tal projects – they dif­fer in is­suer type (pri­vate ver­sus pub­lic) – have very strong credit rat­ings, and tend to ex­pe­ri­ence less volatil­ity com­pared with other in­vest­ment-grade cred­its.</p>
    <p>In­vestors can also con­sider pri­vate mar­kets, where a wealth of projects and start-ups seek fund­ing for their re­spec­tive busi­nesses. Other op­tions in­clude a the­matic ap­proach that fo­cuses on cer­tain themes like waste man­age­ment or en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, and in­vest­ing di­rectly into the stocks or bonds of com­pa­nies that are aligned with the United Na­tions Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals.</p>
    <p>In the wake of the Covid-19 cri­sis, we face a more uncer­tain fu­ture than at any time in re­cent his­tory. With sus­tain­able in­vest­ing, we have the unique op­por­tu­nity to help bring about pos­i­tive out­comes for the world while ben­e­fit­ing fi­nan­cially at the same time.</p>
