    <p>Twelve of 14 pas­sen­gers on board an Aug 19 Scoot flight from Sin­ga­pore to Tian­jin, China, who had a pos­i­tive Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test re­sult were deemed not in­fec­tious, while in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing into the other two cases.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to me­dia queries yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said the 12 were re­cov­ered mi­grant work­ers who had stayed in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>MOH said in­di­vid­u­als may con­tinue to shed vi­ral frag­ments for weeks or even months af­ter in­fec­tion, which may lead to pos­i­tive PCR test re­sults. How­ever, there is no ev­i­dence to sug­gest these rem­nant vi­ral frag­ments are in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>“Stud­ies so far have failed to cul­ture vi­able virus from these pa­tient sam­ples, in­di­cat­ing that these in­di­vid­u­als are no longer in­fec­tious and are thus safe for travel,” MOH said.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press con­fer­ence on Aug 21, the Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak, said: “On oc­ca­sion, some of these work­ers may still have a pos­i­tive PCR test, but all other tests done for them show that they are no longer in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>“We have no prob­lems in cer­ti­fy­ing them fit for travel.”</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, MOH cited World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) guide­lines, which state that the cri­te­ria for dis­charg­ing symp­to­matic pa­tients from isolation with­out re­quir­ing retest­ing are 10 days af­ter symp­tom on­set and at least three ad­di­tional days with­out symp­toms.</p>
    <p>For dis­charg­ing asymp­to­matic pa­tients, only 10 days of isolation are needed fol­low­ing the first pos­i­tive test.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s dis­charge cri­te­ria, which are more strin­gent than WHO’s rec­om­mended guide­lines, Covid-19 pa­tients who are as­sessed to be clin­i­cally well at day 21 of ill­ness are dis­charged.</p>
    <p>MOH said this is based on the lat­est lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional clin­i­cal and sci­en­tific ev­i­dence that shows vi­able virus was not found in Covid-19 pa­tients af­ter the sec­ond week of ill­ness.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries adopt dif­fer­ent dis­charge cri­te­ria that may take into con­sid­er­a­tion fac­tors beyond public health or sci­en­tific lit­er­a­ture. Our dis­charge cri­te­ria have also been shared with the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties,” MOH said.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry added that Sin­ga­pore is in con­tact with the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties for fur­ther in­for­ma­tion on the re­main­ing two cases.</p>
