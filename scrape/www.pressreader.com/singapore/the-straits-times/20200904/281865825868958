    <p>NEW YORK – US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Mr Joe Bi­den clashed on Wed­nes­day in du­elling re­marks and with new ad­ver­tise­ments about pub­lic safety and the out­bursts of vi­o­lence in some US cities, as the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign en­tered an ag­gres­sive new phase.</p>
    <p>The col­li­sions came as a wave of new polling gave the first sig­nif­i­cant snapshot of the race since the Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can con­ven­tions last month.</p>
    <p>The polls showed Mr Bi­den still hold­ing a steady, if not over­whelm­ing, lead, tight enough to give Democrats cause for con­cern and Repub­li­cans room for hope, par­tic­u­larly in the key bat­tle­ground state of Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>Fox News polls on Wed­nes­day showed Mr Bi­den lead­ing in Ari­zona, North Carolina and Wis­con­sin, states Mr Trump won in 2016.</p>
    <p>While Mr Trump has a dwin­dling num­ber of days to re­set a race in which he has con­sis­tently trailed this year, Democrats are still wrestling with the asym­met­ri­cal na­ture of bat­tling a can­di­date willing to make out­landish and false state­ments in pur­suit of vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“Get off Twit­ter,” Mr Bi­den scolded Mr Trump in a speech on Wed­nes­day, urg­ing him to en­gage with con­gres­sional leaders to help sup­port schools and pass an eco­nomic aid pack­age.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent also said he would travel yes­ter­day to Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, where the po­lice shoot­ing of a black man, Mr Ja­cob Blake, set off vi­o­lent protests that prompted Mr Trump to tour burned-down ar­eas on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den will meet Mr Blake’s fa­ther and other fam­ily mem­bers and hold a com­mu­nity meet­ing “to</p>
    <p>heal and ad­dress the chal­lenges we face”.</p>
    <p>The trip will be only Mr Bi­den’s sec­ond out­side the Eastern time zone since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic locked down much of the coun­try al­most six months ago.</p>
    <p>New tele­vi­sion ad­ver­tise­ments were one of the clear­est signs yet that the Bi­den cam­paign is de­ter­mined to keep Mr Trump from re­fram­ing the cam­paign as one of fear over the un­rest in some cities.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is di­rect­ing US$45 mil­lion (S$61 mil­lion) of the record­break­ing US$364.5 mil­lion he raised last month into a sin­gle week of TV and dig­i­tal ads.</p>
    <p>His new com­mer­cial marks the first time that he has put the is­sues of crime and pub­lic safety into a ma­jor paid ad­ver­tis­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Ri­ot­ing is not protest­ing. Loot­ing is not protest­ing,” Mr Bi­den</p>
    <p>says in his ad. “And those who do it should be pros­e­cuted.”</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign coun­tered with ads fea­tur­ing images of burn­ing build­ings. “Com­mu­ni­ties, not crim­i­nals,” says the nar­ra­tor in the Trump ads. “Jobs, not mobs.”</p>
    <p>The themes of the ads are a de­par­ture for Mr Bi­den. Since he first went on the air­waves in June, 75 per cent of his cam­paign’s TV ads have fo­cused on the coro­n­avirus, ac­cord­ing to me­dia track­ing firm Ad­ver­tis­ing An­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Only 5 per cent of Mr Trump’s ads have fo­cused on the virus, com­pared with more than 60 per cent high­light­ing the is­sue of crime.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal ma­noeu­vres show how both can­di­dates are play­ing of­fence and de­fence at once.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is try­ing to press his fi­nan­cial ad­van­tage and keep the fo­cus on the virus and is­sues like</p>
    <p>school re­open­ings, while also de­fend­ing him­self from Mr Trump’s law-and-or­der attacks.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is try­ing to per­suade vot­ers to see threats to pub­lic safety, while also seek­ing to gain mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic strate­gist Stephanie Cut­ter said her party needed to re­lent­lessly fo­cus on the fact that the vi­o­lent protest scenes are play­ing out un­der Mr Trump’s ten­ure.</p>
    <p>“Any time Trump wants to talk about the state of this coun­try, it’s im­por­tant to re­mind peo­ple that Trump is Pres­i­dent and is re­spon­si­ble for the state of the coun­try,” she said.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Chrissy Houla­han said of the vi­o­lence: “You see the scary images. Those are the images we’re liv­ing in right now and this is the ad­min­is­tra­tion re­spon­si­ble.”</p>
