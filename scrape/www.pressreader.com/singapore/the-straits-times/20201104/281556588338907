    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has en­dorsed the con­tro­ver­sial om­nibus law,</p>
    <p>which had sparked mas­sive protests across the coun­try by those who see it as erod­ing labour rights and weak­en­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion. The Job Cre­ation Law was passed in Par­lia­ment on Oct 5 and signed off by Mr Joko on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has en­dorsed a new con­tro­ver­sial om­nibus law which has sparked mas­sive protests across the coun­try by those who see it as erod­ing labour rights and weak­en­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Job Cre­ation Law was passed in Par­lia­ment on Oct 5 and signed off by Mr Joko on Mon­day. Even if he had not signed it, the Bill would au­to­mat­i­cally have taken ef­fect in 30 days.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sign­ing off on the law showed Mr Joko’s com­mit­ment to see through his re­form agenda dur­ing his sec­ond term in of­fice.</p>
    <p>The law is set to sim­plify more than 70 over­lap­ping reg­u­la­tions, cut bu­reau­cracy, stan­dard­ise per­mit pro­ce­dures to at­tract for­eign in­vest­ment, cre­ate jobs and boost the economy, which has been badly bat­tered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s largest economy is ex­pected to shrink this year for the first time since the 1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko painted a bleak eco­nomic out­look on Mon­day, telling his Cab­i­net that the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct is ex­pected to con­tract by more than 3 per cent on an an­nual ba­sis in the third quar­ter and urg­ing them to speed up spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The law has re­ceived sup­port from the busi­ness com­mu­nity which has long be­moaned un­clear and con­flict­ing reg­u­la­tions and ex­ces­sive red tape which make it hard to do busi­ness in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Oct 16, the World Bank had praised the new leg­is­la­tion as “a ma­jor re­form ef­fort to make In­done­sia more com­pet­i­tive and sup­port the coun­try’s long-term as­pi­ra­tion of be­com­ing a pros­per­ous so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>At home, labour unions, green groups, work­ers, stu­dents and even Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tions had op­posed the law, tak­ing to the streets to de­mand that Mr Joko – of­ten re­ferred to as Jokowi – re­voke it through a Perppu, or a reg­u­la­tion in lieu of the law.</p>
    <p>They said the new reg­u­la­tions would hurt work­ers by slash­ing sev­er­ance pay, af­fect­ing min­i­mum wages and mak­ing it pos­si­ble for peo­ple to be em­ployed on a con­tract ba­sis in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal­ists also ob­jected, point­ing out the re­moval of a strict li­a­bil­ity clause that pro­vides a le­gal ba­sis to sue cor­po­ra­tions for caus­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age such as in the case of for­est fires.</p>
    <p>The protests are un­likely to abate. Hours be­fore Mr Joko signed off on the law on Mon­day, thou­sands ral­lied peace­fully in the cap­i­tal Jakarta, as well as other cities in­clud­ing Yo­gyakarta, Banda Aceh, Medan and Makas­sar.</p>
    <p>Two labour unions, the Con­fed­er­a­tion of In­done­sian Trade Unions (KSPI) and the All-In­done­sia Work­ers Unions Con­fed­er­a­tion (KSPSI AGN), yes­ter­day filed a ju­di­cial re­view of the law at the Con­sti­tu­tional Court.</p>
    <p>KSPI pres­i­dent Said Iqbal said in a state­ment: “After we stud­ied the con­tent of the law, es­pe­cially on labour, al­most ev­ery­thing is un­favourable to the work­ers.”</p>
    <p>He added: “KSPI will con­tinue to carry out ac­tions and strikes in line with the con­sti­tu­tional rights of the work­ers and which are non­vi­o­lent in na­ture.”</p>
