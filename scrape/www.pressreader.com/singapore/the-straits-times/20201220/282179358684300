    <p>Shut­tered dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, en­rich­ment cen­tres reached out to fam­i­lies in novel ways.</p>
    <p>Happy Fish Swim School held live-stream ses­sions on Face­book to teach par­ents how to guide their tod­dlers to do swim­ming move­ments in a small bath­tub at home.</p>
    <p>Da Lit­tle Arts School launched DaBox, a craft box with dif­fer­ent themes that proved to be a hit with par­ents need­ing to oc­cupy their lit­tle ones dur­ing the stay-in pe­riod.</p>
    <p>As vir­tual learn­ing be­came the norm overnight, ven­dors like Fly­ing Cape, an on­line book­ing plat­form for tu­ition and en­rich­ment, be­gan work­ing with over­seas providers to of­fer on­line en­rich­ment, in­clud­ing Chi­nese lan­guage and art from China, and mu­sic lessons from London and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Once cen­tres were al­lowed to re­sume lessons in June, many saw long wait­ing lists form­ing as par­ents sought to give their lit­tle ones a sense of nor­mal­ity with fun classes. At the same time, they faced ris­ing costs be­cause of en­hanced safety mea­sures and ca­pac­ity lim­its.</p>
    <p>Per­haps one of the most in­no­va­tive ideas came from Swish! Swim­ming school. It launched so­cially dis­tanced swim pod classes for ba­bies and their par­ents, com­plete with In­sta­grammable back­drops and props, as well as luxe pods (above) with their own fil­tra­tion and sani­ti­sa­tion sys­tems.</p>
