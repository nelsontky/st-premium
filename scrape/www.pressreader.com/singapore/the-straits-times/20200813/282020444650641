    <p>The great para­dox about the re­sponse of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion to the chal­lenge from China is that it is both over­es­ti­mat­ing and un­der­es­ti­mat­ing this chal­lenge. The over­es­ti­ma­tion is clear; the un­der­es­ti­ma­tion, which is more dan­ger­ous, less so.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo spelt out clearly his case for over­es­ti­ma­tion in his speech at the Nixon Li­brary on July 23.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing stag­ger­ing statis­tics of China trade abuses that cost Amer­i­can jobs and strike enor­mous blows to the economies all across Amer­ica, in­clud­ing here in South­ern Cal­i­for­nia,” he said. “And we’re watch­ing a Chi­nese mil­i­tary that grows stronger and stronger and in­deed more men­ac­ing.”</p>
    <p>One could be for­given for be­liev­ing that China is about to mount a mil­i­tary in­va­sion of the United States. Yet, there is no doubt that in the mil­i­tary field, the US is much stronger than China.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Pom­peo said: “We’ve called on China to con­form its nu­clear ca­pa­bil­i­ties to the strate­gic re­al­i­ties of our time.”</p>
    <p>If China heeded his call, then it would have to add more than 5,500 nu­clear weapons to its stock­pile since it has only over 300 weapons, com­pared with al­most 6,000 for the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo also de­clared that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) was ex­ploit­ing Amer­ica’s “free and open so­ci­ety” and “sent pro­pa­gan­dists into our press con­fer­ences, our re­search cen­tres, our high schools, our col­leges and even into our PTA (par­ent-teacher as­so­ci­a­tion) meet­ings”.</p>
    <p>In short, Chi­nese agents of in­flu­ence have in­fil­trated all seg­ments of Amer­i­can so­ci­ety and could un­der­mine it. The most telling word Mr Pom­peo used to de­scribe the CCP was “Franken­stein”. This word im­plies that a mon­ster was now threat­en­ing Amer­ica. It would be rea­son­able for an Amer­i­can to feel scared af­ter hear­ing the speech.</p>
    <p>Yet, even though the re­cent speeches on China by Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have been stri­dent, they ul­ti­mately un­der­es­ti­mate the chal­lenge posed by China be­cause they fail to re­al­is­ti­cally ex­plain its na­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo makes it clear that it is the com­mu­nist ide­ol­ogy of the CCP that is threat­en­ing Amer­ica. As he said: “Gen­eral Sec­re­tary Xi Jin­ping is a true be­liever in a bank­rupt to­tal­i­tar­ian ide­ol­ogy. It’s this ide­ol­ogy that in­forms his decades-long de­sire for global hege­mony of China com­mu­nism.”</p>
    <p>If global hege­mony was in­deed China’s goal, then Amer­i­cans can re­lax. Any such am­bi­tion of global hege­mony will fail. The world will re­ject it.</p>
    <p>The CCP is ac­tu­ally a far more for­mi­da­ble com­peti­tor to Amer­ica be­cause its pri­mary goal is not global hege­mony. It is to re­vive the world’s old­est and most re­silient civil­i­sa­tion and re­store its nat­u­ral place as the most suc­cess­ful civil­i­sa­tion for most of hu­man his­tory. And the CCP is do­ing a very good job at this process of re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion. One lit­tle-known fact about the CCP is that since the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China was establishe­d in 1949, 71 years ago, this is the strong­est it has ever been.</p>
    <p>A Har­vard Kennedy School Ash Cen­tre study ti­tled Un­der­stand­ing CCP Re­silience, pub­lished last month, ex­plains why the CCP is so pop­u­lar in China. “Regime the­ory has long ar­gued that au­thor­i­tar­ian sys­tems are in­her­ently un­sta­ble be­cause of their de­pen­dence on co­er­cion, over-cen­tral­i­sa­tion of de­ci­sion-mak­ing, and the priv­i­leg­ing of per­sonal over in­sti­tu­tional power,” ac­cord­ing to the re­port. “Over time, these in­ef­fi­cien­cies tend to weaken the le­git­i­macy of the rul­ing govern­ment, lead­ing to gen­er­alised un­rest and cit­i­zen dis­sat­is­fac­tion.”</p>
    <p>This is what should have hap­pened in China. In­stead, as this re­port says, “the party ap­pears to be as strong as ever. A deeper re­silience is founded on pop­u­lar sup­port for regime pol­icy”. This is why the re­port con­cludes that “there is lit­tle ev­i­dence to sup­port the idea that the CCP is los­ing le­git­i­macy in the eyes of its peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo was also un­der­es­ti­mat­ing and mis­un­der­stand­ing the Chi­nese chal­lenge when he spoke of the dis­tinc­tion be­tween the CCP and the Chi­nese peo­ple. He said: “We must also en­gage and em­power the Chi­nese peo­ple – a dy­namic, free­dom-lov­ing peo­ple who are com­pletely dis­tinct from the CCP.”</p>
    <p>Here are some im­por­tant statis­tics. Each year, more than 20 mil­lion Chi­nese ap­ply to join the CCP. About 12 per cent of them get in, mak­ing it as dif­fi­cult to join the party as it is to get into lead­ing uni­ver­si­ties in Amer­ica. In short, the CCP is not a party about to crack up un­der Amer­i­can pres­sure: It is float­ing on an ocean of le­git­i­macy among 1.4 bil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple, who are now happy as they are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a new high tide in the his­tory of Chi­nese civil­i­sa­tion. The 2020 Edel­man Trust Barom­e­ter re­ports that 90 per cent of the Chi­nese peo­ple sup­port the Chi­nese govern­ment.</p>
    <p>All this ex­plains a key weak­ness of the Amer­i­can strat­egy to­wards China. No coun­try, with the pos­si­ble un­wise ex­cep­tion of the cur­rent Aus­tralian govern­ment, has jumped onto the Amer­i­can band­wagon as it rushes to con­front China. Not even close al­lies such as the United King­dom. One in­flu­en­tial Bri­tish fig­ure noted in Davos in Jan­uary that the UK would pro­ceed to in­stall 5G tech­nol­ogy from Huawei as Bri­tish in­tel­li­gence agen­cies had thor­oughly scrubbed the Huawei soft­ware. He con­fi­dently as­serted that the US could not arm-twist the UK as the US needed the UK as much as the UK needed the US.</p>
    <p>By last month, the UK had ca­pit­u­lated. One can only imag­ine the arm-twist­ing that took place. What a con­trast to the Cold War when the UK and the US were com­plete com­rades-in-arms.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is right on one point. There are ris­ing lev­els of con­cern around the world on the new as­sertive­ness dis­played by China, from the “wolf-war­rior” diplo­mats in Europe to the killings of the In­dian sol­diers in the Hi­malayas.</p>
    <p>An in­tel­li­gent and thought­ful Amer­i­can strat­egy that tried to bal­ance Chi­nese as­sertive­ness by de­vel­op­ing a wide net­work of friends across the globe could work. In­stead, as Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy ex­pert Richard Haas says, “un­der this ad­min­is­tra­tion, we treat the Euro­pean Union as an eco­nomic foe, bash South Korea and Ja­pan... it is not re­al­is­tic to ex­pect al­lies to stand up to a pow­er­ful neigh­bour if they can­not count on us”.</p>
    <p>If the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion or the US is se­ri­ous about tak­ing on the Chi­nese chal­lenge, it needs to do a com­plete re­boot and work out a thought­ful long-term strat­egy. It should also heed the ad­vice of its pre­vi­ous strate­gic thinkers in try­ing to un­der­stand the real na­ture of the CCP.</p>
