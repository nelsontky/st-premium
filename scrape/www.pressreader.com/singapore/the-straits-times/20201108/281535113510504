    <p>Flanked by moun­tains with a view of the Great Wall just two hours from Beijing is a small county of 320,000 peo­ple that has a rep­u­ta­tion of na­tional and his­tor­i­cal pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>Luan­ping, in north-eastern He­bei prov­ince, is known as the home of pu­tonghua, or Man­darin, the main of­fi­cial lan­guage of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one in this pic­turesque, idyl­lic place – from pri­mary school chil­dren and shop­keep­ers in the town cen­tre, to re­tired el­derly vil­lagers – speaks the per­fect Man­darin that news­cast­ers and TV an­chors on na­tional television as­pire to.</p>
    <p>Mr Bai Fen­gran, 81, re­mem­bers the day in 1953 when he – then a 14-year-old stu­dent – was sum­moned to the teach­ers’ of­fice to meet two men.</p>
    <p>“I was one of the top stu­dents in school and the teacher said, ‘These peo­ple want to talk to you’,” said the re­tired Chi­nese teacher from Jin­goutun vil­lage in the county.</p>
    <p>“They made me read out loud from news­pa­pers.”</p>
    <p>It was only after the men left that Mr Bai re­alised they were lin­guists sent by the Chi­nese cen­tral gov­ern­ment to col­lect speech sam­ples from around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Bai and six other el­derly vil­lagers are now af­fec­tion­ately known as the qi lao, or “the seven ven­er­a­bles”, whose pho­netic sam­ples helped de­ter­mine Luan­ping’s stan­dard of pu­tonghua as the na­tion’s lin­gua franca.</p>
    <p>That hon­our came in 1956, when the State Coun­cil, or the Chi­nese Cabi­net, of­fi­cially de­fined pu­tonghua as “the stan­dard form of modern Chi­nese with the</p>
    <p>Beijing phono­log­i­cal sys­tem as its norm of pro­nun­ci­a­tion, and north­ern di­alects as its base di­alect, while its gram­mar is de­rived from canon­i­cal lit­er­ary</p>
    <p>works writ­ten in the modern ver­nac­u­lar”.</p>
    <p>While close to Beijing’s pho­netic, Luan­ping’s speech was con­sid­ered more “pure” as it did not have a strong rhotaci­sa­tion – the ex­ces­sive pro­nun­ci­a­tion of an “r” sound – that made the Beijing di­alect dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>“The im­ple­men­ta­tion of this ver­sion of pu­tonghua in cul­tural and ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions and across var­i­ous as­pects of the cit­i­zens’ lives is the main way through which the uni­fi­ca­tion of the Chi­nese lan­guage is pro­moted,” said the 1956 gov­ern­ment di­rec­tive.</p>
    <p>About 75 per cent of Chi­nese now speak it, ac­cord­ing to the</p>
    <p>State Lan­guage Com­mis­sion, which has set a tar­get of in­creas­ing the num­ber of Man­darin speak­ers na­tion­wide to 80 per cent by the end of this year, re­ported state me­dia China Daily.</p>
    <p>The State Lan­guage Com­mis­sion also des­ig­nated Luan­ping as “the only place to ex­pe­ri­ence stan­dard Man­darin”.</p>
    <p>The vil­lagers did not make any­thing of the 1953 sur­vey – they all thought the en­tire coun­try spoke Man­darin the same way.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple no­tice how per­fect our pu­tonghua is, but to the peo­ple of Luan­ping, they think, ‘What’s so spe­cial about the way we speak?’ ” said Mr Deng Xi­u­jun, for­mer pres­i­dent of the Luan­ping chap­ter of the China Fed­er­a­tion of Lit­er­ary and Art Cir­cles.</p>
    <p>HIS­TOR­I­CAL ROOTS</p>
    <p>Luan­ping’s lan­guage story goes back to the Ming Dy­nasty in 1403 when Em­peror Yon­gle moved the cap­i­tal from Nan­jing to Beijing.</p>
    <p>To pro­tect the em­pire and new cap­i­tal from at­tacks by Mon­go­lia, he or­dered vil­lagers and troops out­side the Jin­shan­ling sec­tion of</p>
    <p>the Great Wall near Luan­ping to move within the city walls.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til the be­gin­ning of the Qing Dy­nasty (1644-1911) that Em­peror Kangxi de­cided to de­velop the area, which had been un­in­hab­ited for more than two cen­turies. Luan­ping’s di­alect had also long died out.</p>
    <p>As the re­gion was pop­u­lated again, of­fi­cials and no­bles who had moved there spoke the lan­guage of the im­pe­rial court that was to form the ba­sis of pu­tonghua to­day.</p>
    <p>Qing lead­ers also built the famed Chengde Moun­tain Re­sort, turn­ing it into a sec­ond po­lit­i­cal cen­tre out­side of Beijing.</p>
    <p>As Luan­ping was be­tween Beijing and the moun­tain re­sort, it be­came a pit stop for of­fi­cials mak­ing the jour­ney, and they in turn left a legacy of their spo­ken lan­guage be­hind in the tiny county.</p>
    <p>“Luan­ping has main­tained the</p>
    <p>DNA of the lan­guage since then,” said Mr Deng.</p>
    <p>But ef­forts to stan­dard­ise a lan­guage for the en­tire coun­try dates back even fur­ther, driven by the need to unify a coun­try with a huge di­ver­sity of lo­cal lan­guages and di­alects not eas­ily un­der­stood by fel­low coun­try­men.</p>
    <p>After a rev­o­lu­tion top­pled China’s last im­pe­rial dy­nasty in 1911, the lead­ers of a repub­li­can gov­ern­ment called for the es­tab­lish­ment of a guo yu, or na­tional lan­guage, to unify the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In 1913 at the Con­fer­ence on the Uni­fi­ca­tion of Pro­nun­ci­a­tion in Beijing, lin­guists and of­fi­cials from across the coun­try de­bated over which di­alect should form the ba­sis of a new na­tional uni­fied lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Man­darin, spo­ken by north­ern­ers and as­so­ci­ated with Manchu of­fi­cials, was con­sid­ered a lan­guage of the “in­vaders”.</p>
    <p>The south­ern­ers wanted Can­tonese to be adopted as the coun­try’s lin­gua franca.</p>
    <p>Can­tonese lost by one vote to Man­darin, so the story goes.</p>
    <p>LUAN­PING’S EDGE</p>
    <p>To pro­mote pu­tonghua, the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties now re­quire teach­ers, state en­ter­prise em­ploy­ees and front-line of­fi­cials to be cer­ti­fied in Man­darin pro­nun­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>And Luan­ping’s res­i­dents al­ways pass with fly­ing colours.</p>
    <p>At a cer­ti­fi­ca­tion cen­tre in Luan­ping, pub­lic ser­vant Zhao Ning, 39, had just taken a test where she had to re­cite a list of words, then sen­tences, into a mi­cro­phone in front of a com­puter screen.</p>
    <p>She did not have to prac­tise much.</p>
    <p>“As na­tives of Luan­ping, we all speak per­fect Man­darin, so there’s no dif­fi­culty with this test,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Speak­ing good pu­tonghua is ex­tremely im­por­tant be­cause we as pub­lic ser­vants deal with the com­mon peo­ple a lot. We shouldn’t have a com­mu­ni­ca­tion bar­rier.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ji Xuey­ong, a mem­ber of Luan­ping’s Ed­u­ca­tion Work­ing Com­mit­tee, said the county plans to de­velop a pu­tonghua econ­omy of­fer­ing lan­guage train­ing and tourism.</p>
    <p>It is al­ready build­ing a lan­guage mu­seum that is slated to open next year.</p>
    <p>Luan­ping na­tives also have an edge over oth­ers when it comes to jobs.</p>
    <p>Ms Ma Xi­umei, 42, prin­ci­pal of No. 5 Pri­mary School, said: “When com­pa­nies do re­cruit­ment, they are very will­ing to hire peo­ple from Luan­ping.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have a strong pro­vin­cial ac­cent, and we don’t need to be put through lan­guage train­ing. Ev­ery­one can un­der­stand what we’re say­ing.</p>
    <p>“It has be­come our call­ing card.”</p>
