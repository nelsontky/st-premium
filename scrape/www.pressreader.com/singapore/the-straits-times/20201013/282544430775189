    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The War With Grandpa, a Robert De Niro comedy about the bat­tle be­tween a wily sep­tu­a­ge­nar­ian and his grand­son over a bed­room, was orig­i­nally sup­posed to hit the­atres in 2018.</p>
    <p>Plans changed af­ter Har­vey Weinstein, the in­die fil m pro­ducer whose com­pany The Weinstein Com­pany fi­nanced the Home Alone knock­off, was ex­posed as a se­rial sex­ual ha­rasser and preda­tor.</p>
    <p>His fall from power led to the dis­so­lu­tion of The Weinstein Com­pany and plunged The War With Grandpa and other films that the stu­dio had ex­pected to re­lease, such as The Up­side (2017) and The Cur­rent War (2017), into a per­ilous kind of limbo.</p>
    <p>Two years af­ter it was in­tended to hit cin­e­mas, The War With Grandpa fi­nally de­buted, al­though in a markedly dif­fer­ent the­atri­cal land­scape, one that faces an ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis brought on by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The film grossed US$3.6 mil­lion (S$4.9 mil­lion) from 2,205 lo­ca­tions while re­ceiv­ing a brush-off from crit­ics who dis­missed it as de­riv­a­tive and joy­less. In pan­demic times when ma­jor mar­kets like New York City and Los An­ge­les are closed, that may rank as a de­cent open­ing.</p>
    <p>That be­ing said, as Forbes notes, it still clocks in as the worst box-of­fice top­per since 1988, so clearly the ex­hi­bi­tion in­dus­try is fac­ing some very pun­ish­ing head­winds.</p>
    <p>101 Stu­dios, the new la­bel run by for­mer Weinstein Com­pany ex­ec­u­tive David Glasser, picked up the rights to The War With Grandpa and re­leased it. The com­pany also dis­trib­uted the sim­i­larly or­phaned The Cur­rent War last October, with the sub­ti­tle The Di­rec­tor’s Cut.</p>
    <p>This week, The War With Grandpa has un­seated di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan’s Tenet from the top slot. In its sixth week of re­lease, Tenet grossed US$2.1 mil­lion in North Amer­ica, bring­ing its haul to US$48.3 mil­lion. The Warner Bros sci-fi thriller took in an es­ti­mated US$9.8 mil­lion glob­ally this week­end in 62 mar­kets, push­ing its world­wide to­tal to US$323.3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney’s re-re­lease of Ho­cus Pocus con­tin­ued to be a rare Covid-era hit, earn­ing US$1.2 mil­lion. The comedy about a coven of witches star­ring Bette Mi­dler, Sarah Jes­sica Parker and Kathy Na­jimy was a box-of­fice dis­ap­point­ment when it de­buted in 1993, but be­came a cult clas­sic on ca­ble and other home en­ter­tain­ment plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The New Mu­tants, the X-Men spin-off that Dis­ney in­her­ited af­ter it pur­chased Fox, earned US$685,000, push­ing its North Amer­i­can gross to US$22 mil­lion. With those tepid re­sults, The New Mu­tants: Part 2 seems like a dream that will be per­ma­nently de­ferred.</p>
