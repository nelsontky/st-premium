    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s de­ter­mi­na­tion not to ac­cept the re­sults of the re­cent elec­tion is a his­tor­i­cal first for the United States, but has no se­ri­ous le­gal im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the pro­vi­sions of the US Con­sti­tu­tion and elec­toral laws passed by the US Congress more than a cen­tury ago, all the Amer­i­can states are obliged to re­solve their in­ter­nal dis­putes about their in­di­vid­ual re­sults by Dec 8.</p>
    <p>Each state must also vote on the se­lec­tion of the new pres­i­dent by Dec 14, with a joint ses­sion of the two houses of the US Congress rat­i­fy­ing the out­come on Jan 6, re­gard­less of what the cur­rent oc­cu­pant of the Oval Of­fice says.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Trump has shat­tered an im­por­tant Amer­i­can dream: that of a peace­ful trans­fer of power from one pres­i­dent to an­other, of­ten touted as one of the most dis­tinct and ad­mirable qual­i­ties of US po­lit­i­cal life.</p>
    <p>In coun­tries where gov­ern­ing reg­u­larly al­ter­nates be­tween par­ties, the trans­fer of power is a cu­ri­ously in­for­mal af­fair.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially the case in coun­tries that have in­her­ited the Bri­tish sys­tem of gov­ern­ment, where the first-past-the-post elec­toral sys­tem pro­duces a de­ci­sive ma­jor­ity for one party or an­other, the re­sult is known hours af­ter the polls close, and a new gov­ern­ment is in­stalled the next day.</p>
    <p>In the case of Bri­tain it­self, where gen­eral elec­tions are al­ways held on a Thurs­day, the leader of the win­ning party is re­ceived by the monarch at around 11am on Fri­day. The leader kisses the sov­er­eign’s hand and then drives from the palace di­rectly to Down­ing Street as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tish-style po­lit­i­cal sys­tems, any dither­ing or de­lay in the trans­fer of power is con­sid­ered a sign of ma­jor weak­ness.</p>
    <p>So, when the 2010 elec­tion in Bri­tain failed to pro­duce a work­ing ma­jor­ity for any party, the Queen let it be known that she would not wait more than a week for the politi­cians to de­cide how to form a gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish-style po­lit­i­cal sys­tem re­lies on pre­par­ing the op­po­si­tion for power years in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers of the op­po­si­tion have their own tax­payer-funded of­fices and re­ceive both of­fi­cial and con­fi­den­tial brief­ings. “Shadow” min­is­ters from the op­po­si­tion fol­low the min­is­ters in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Most Euro­pean coun­tries, how­ever, op­er­ate elec­toral sys­tems of pro­por­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tion where no sin­gle party se­cures a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity. Coali­tions must be formed, and that takes time.</p>
    <p>Although Ger­many’s elec­toral sys­tem also pro­duces in­con­clu­sive re­sults and coali­tions with par­ties that may have no pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ment ex­pe­ri­ence, the Ger­man Con­sti­tu­tion is very spe­cific about the modal­i­ties of the trans­fer of power.</p>
    <p>This is largely to avoid the his­toric ex­pe­ri­ence that saw the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s, which was fa­cil­i­tated by a dys­func­tional sys­tem of gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­cans are still unique in the way their Con­sti­tu­tion is writ­ten to pre­clude the dan­ger of any­one cling­ing to power.</p>
    <p>The two houses of Congress are re-elected at dif­fer­ent times. Elec­toral cy­cles are spec­i­fied in strict terms and can­not be moved.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dents are lim­ited to two con­sec­u­tive terms. And there are spe­cific dates man­dated by law on which politi­cians must leave of­fice or be sworn into of­fice.</p>
    <p>Not­with­stand­ing this rigid struc­ture, the US sys­tem is cu­ri­ously silent on the ac­tual mech­a­nism of power trans­fer. It is a con­ven­tion, rather than a le­gal pro­vi­sion, for the out­go­ing pres­i­dent to give the in­com­ing one all nec­es­sary as­sis­tance, in­clud­ing ac­cess to daily in­tel­li­gence brief­ings.</p>
    <p>The only le­gal re­quire­ment is that the US Gen­eral Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion, the fed­eral agency re­spon­si­ble for the ba­sic op­er­a­tion of the gov­ern­ment, pro­vides top of­fi­cials of the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion with of­fice space and pays for their se­cu­rity pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Apart from that, there is noth­ing which an in­com­ing pres­i­dent can legally de­mand.</p>
    <p>It is vir­tu­ally cer­tain that Mr Trump’s be­hav­iour will prompt US politi­cians to look again at how they con­duct their trans­fer of power.</p>
    <p>And the cur­rent ex­pe­ri­ence may en­cour­age them to be hum­bler in pre­sent­ing the al­ter­na­tion of power in Amer­ica as the best model for other na­tions to em­u­late.</p>
