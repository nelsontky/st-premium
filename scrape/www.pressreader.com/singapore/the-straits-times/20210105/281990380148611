    <p>For bit­coin spec­u­la­tors, last year was a bo­nanza. The cryp­tocur­rency started in January last year at US$7,194 and on Sun­day surged above US$34,000 – a more than 360 per cent an­nual re­turn.</p>
    <p>Cour­tesy of the United States Fed­eral Re­serve, as­set buy­ers in gen­eral have had a stel­lar pan­demic. Whether it was US Trea­suries or junk bonds, eq­uity port­fo­lios or high-end prop­erty, the free money gusher has lifted all as­set prices. Nor is the Fed in­clined to stop the party. This year could of­fer a sim­i­lar kind of boom to last.</p>
    <p>Even if they do not trig­ger high in­fla­tion, the Fed’s ex­tra­or­di­nary in­ter­ven­tions will come with steep price tags.</p>
    <p>No doubt these would be far lower than the Fed not hav­ing acted at all – par­tic­u­larly in the short term. Had it for­gone the more than US$3 tril­lion (S$3.95 tril­lion) ex­pan­sion to its bal­ance sheet since last March, the US econ­omy would have gone into free fall. Cor­po­rate bank­rupt­cies would have piled up and there could have been a 2008-style fi­nan­cial melt­down.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse to crit­ics is the same to­day as it was af­ter the 2008 cri­sis: that the Fed is do­ing what­ever it takes to pre­vent a de­pres­sion. But the risk is that each new chap­ter tight­ens a doom loop in which the US sov­er­eign must even­tu­ally reckon with the ever-widen­ing class of risk it is un­der­writ­ing.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s na­tional debt is al­ready past 100 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) for the first time since World War II. It nearly dou­bled af­ter 2008 and is ris­ing sharply again.</p>
    <p>As Ja­pan has shown, high in­debt­ed­ness need not trig­ger a cri­sis. Its na­tional debt is well over 200 per cent of GDP. But as the is­suer of the world’s re­serve cur­rency, the US must guard its role care­fully.</p>
    <p>The most vis­i­ble threat, how­ever, is to US po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Fed’s quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing boosts wealth in­equal­ity by in­creas­ing the net worth of those who own fi­nan­cial as­sets, chiefly of stocks and bonds.</p>
    <p>The top 10 per cent of Amer­i­cans own 84 per cent of the coun­try’s shares. The top 1 per cent own about half. The bot­tom half of Amer­i­cans – the ones who have chiefly been on the front line dur­ing the pan­demic – say they own al­most no stocks at all.</p>
    <p>The fur­ther up the scale you go, the greater the gains. The S&P 500 In­dex showed a re­turn of around 16.2 per cent last year. Its global lux­ury in­dex yielded a re­mark­able 34 per cent. To be sure, many of the eq­uity mar­ket’s gains have gone to big tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, such as Ama­zon and Net­flix, which have ben­e­fited from the par­tial clo­sure of the phys­i­cal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But their gains have heav­ily out­weighed losses in the worst-hit sec­tors, such as cruise lin­ers and oil drillers. All that money must find some place to go. At the start of last year, five-year Trea­sury bonds yielded 1.67 per cent. By the end, it had fallen to 0.37 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Fed’s in­escapable bias to­wards as­set own­ers has com­bined with the fi­nan­cial sec­tor’s pref­er­ence for size to pro­duce a very skewed re­cov­ery. This has ben­e­fited big com­pa­nies, even junk-rated ones, at the ex­pense of small busi­nesses, in­clud­ing fi­nan­cially sound ones.</p>
    <p>And it has boosted wealthy in­di­vid­u­als over me­dian house­holds. Af­ter 2008, the eco­nomic re­cov­ery co­ex­isted with a so-called “main street re­ces­sion”. To­day we call it a K-shaped re­cov­ery. The ma­jor­ity of peo­ple are suf­fer­ing amid a Great Gatsby-style boom at the top.</p>
    <p>What­ever we la­bel it, the po­lit­i­cal re­ac­tion is un­likely to be pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The co­in­ci­dence is un­for­tu­nate for Demo­cratic pres­i­dents. Just as Mr Barack Obama in­her­ited the Great Re­ces­sion, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is walk­ing into the Great Pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Mr Obama’s case, the back­lash to his two-speed econ­omy trig­gered a Tea Party pop­ulism that even­tu­ally brought his pres­i­dency to a halt. Not much of fis­cal note hap­pened af­ter his ini­tial US$787 bil­lion stim­u­lus in Fe­bru­ary 2009. That meant the Fed had to go on do­ing the work of keep­ing the econ­omy afloat.</p>
    <p>In 2013, then Fed chair Ben Ber­nanke an­nounced plans to re­duce the scale of its bond-buy­ing pro­gramme known as quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing. He was quickly forced to re­verse af­ter the mar­ket went into a “ta­per tantrum”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den could find him­self in a sim­i­lar two-speed econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Last month, Congress passed a US$900 bil­lion stim­u­lus, which will tide most un­em­ployed Amer­i­cans over un­til March and send US$600 cheques to in­di­vid­u­als earn­ing less than US$75,000 a year. But Mr Bi­den’s chances of pass­ing a far larger “build back bet­ter” re­lief pack­age af­ter he takes of­fice look slim. By con­trast, cur­rent Fed chair Jay Pow­ell has said the cen­tral bank’s sup­port could be in­def­i­nite. The Fed will con­tinue to buy US$120 bil­lion of debt a month for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Here are the po­ten­tial seeds of Amer­ica’s next pop­ulist cri­sis. The Fed is pledg­ing to do what it takes, while the coun­try’s elected of­fi­cials seem un­likely to agree on fis­cal pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The right em­pha­sis, as Mr Pow­ell keeps re­mind­ing Congress, would be the other way round. Mon­e­tary pol­icy is a blunt tool. Spend­ing by con­trast can be tar­geted at those who need it and help lift Amer­ica’s growth po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Alas, the chances are that the</p>
    <p>Fed will re­main “the only game in town”. This would be both a missed op­por­tu­nity and pose a se­vere dan­ger.</p>
    <p>The op­por­tu­nity is for the US govern­ment to bor­row long-term funds at near-zero rates and in­vest them in pro­duc­tive ca­pac­ity. The dan­ger of not do­ing that can be ex­pressed in a sim­ple equa­tion: QE – F = P. Quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing mi­nus fis­cal ac­tion equals pop­ulism.</p>
    <p>The top 10 per cent of Amer­i­cans own 84 per cent of the coun­try’s shares.</p>
    <p>The top 1 per cent own about half. The bot­tom half of Amer­i­cans – the ones who have chiefly been on the front line dur­ing the pan­demic – say they own al­most no stocks at all.</p>
