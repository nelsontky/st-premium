    <p>Re­ports that sug­gest the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue has lost its fiz­zle may be vastly ex­ag­ger­ated, as it has come a long way since its first it­er­a­tions over a decade ago, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Ravi Vel­loor (be­low).</p>
    <p>Shortly after the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue that groups the United States, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia was re­vived in Novem­ber 2017, Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi was asked about the de­vel­op­ment at a press con­fer­ence held on the side­lines of the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang’s re­sponse at the time was that there was no short­age of head­line-grab­bing ideas and the Quad was one such. It would be</p>
    <p>“like the foam on the sea… (to) get at­ten­tion but will soon dis­si­pate”, was his assess­ment then.</p>
    <p>Prior to last week’s meet­ing of Quad for­eign min­is­ters in Tokyo, only the sec­ond time the group had met for­mally at this level, China’s Global Times head­lined: “Not easy for Pom­peo to sway China’s neigh­bours in build­ing mil­i­tary al­liance”. After the event, the news­pa­per spoke of “All US’ bark and no bite in Quad meet­ing”.</p>
    <p>This week, Mr Wang seemed to be tak­ing the Quad more se­ri­ously than the Global Times, the flintier of China’s English-lan­guage mouth­pieces, seemed to do. In Kuala Lumpur on Tues­day, he crit­i­cised the Quad’s “Cold War men­tal­ity” and warned of heavy se­cu­rity risks from a “so-called Indo-Pa­cific Nato”.</p>
    <p>Whichever way you look at it one thing is clear – the Quad has come a long way since its first it­er­a­tions more than a decade ago.</p>
    <p>That new Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga chose to make host­ing a meet­ing of Quad for­eign min­is­ters his de­but for­eign pol­icy ini­tia­tive sug­gests that some coun­tries do in­deed set much store by it, en­thu­si­as­ti­cally backed by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in the US.</p>
    <p>This is why US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, whose planned trip to Asia had to be cut short be­cause of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion for Covid-19, made it a point to show up phys­i­cally in Tokyo, for a stop last­ing less than 24 hours.</p>
    <p>DO­MES­TIC CON­STRAINTS</p>
    <p>Yet, the re­al­is­tic assess­ment of last week’s meet­ing – the US was the only par­tic­i­pant to call out China – has to be that at the very min­i­mum, a Quad mem­ber or two is stalling for time.</p>
    <p>Make that In­dia, Asia’s sec­ond-largest nation by pop­u­la­tion, which is now tan­gled up in a se­ri­ous bor­der cri­sis with the dom­i­nant Asian power – a sit­u­a­tion from which it needs to ex­tri­cate it­self in or­der to fo­cus on a run­away pan­demic and a col­lapsed econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It may even have com­pany; Aus­tralia has shown sig­nif­i­cant steel in stand­ing up to China this year but it has not been with­out costs. And while it may be re­luc­tant to con­cede that it, too, would wel­come a breather, there are good rea­sons it might. Here’s why.</p>
    <p>Much of the nation’s elan for the past three decades has been based on what seemed like a te­flon-coated econ­omy. But that owed to its abil­ity to pump com­mod­ity ex­ports into China, and do­mes­tic as­sets such as real es­tate that in­flated thanks to Chi­nese buy­ing.</p>
    <p>With­out China, its econ­omy weak­ens sub­stan­tially. Its re­tail scene, for in­stance, is mori­bund. Re­tail spend­ing slumped to a 28-year low last year and many es­tab­lish­ments have shut down, driven by a wave of con­sumer change the sec­tor had not fore­seen.</p>
    <p>“If one word had to be used in de­scrib­ing the cur­rent state of Aus­tralian re­tail and broader econ­omy, per­haps ‘tem­pes­tu­ous’ is the most ap­pro­pri­ate,” said KPMG, a con­sul­tancy, in its Aus­tralian Re­tail Out­look for 2020.</p>
    <p>The re­tail slump pre­dated the pan­demic. Last month, China’s debt-gorged real es­tate sec­tor’s woes re­ver­ber­ated all the way Down Un­der when China’s Poly Group pulled out from a ma­jor real es­tate de­vel­op­ment pro­moted by Lendlease, the coun­try’s iconic builder, and told Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view that it was re­think­ing all its prospec­tive Aus­tralian projects.</p>
    <p>For all the state­ments about main­tain­ing an Indo-Pa­cific “gov­erned by rules, not power”, as Aus­tralian For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne put it in Tokyo, one el­e­ment of the Quad ar­chi­tec­ture that would sig­nal a de­ter­mi­na­tion to build more teeth seems to have been kept in abeyance – an In­dian in­vi­ta­tion to Aus­tralia to re­join the an­nual Mal­abar mar­itime ex­er­cises it con­ducts with the US and Ja­panese navies.</p>
    <p>In July, as ten­sions with China es­ca­lated, lead­ing to an ugly clash in the Ladakh Hi­malayas that saw loss of lives on both sides, New Delhi leaked word that it had de­cided to bring Aus­tralia into Mal­abar. It was thought that For­eign Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar would for­mally con­vey the de­ci­sion to his coun­ter­part in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>If that was done, nei­ther side has talked about it. What’s more, nei­ther has there been any an­nounce­ment on dates for this year’s Mal­abar, an ex­er­cise that in at least one it­er­a­tion in­volved three air­craft car­ri­ers sail­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>New Delhi might be look­ing to wait out the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. Hav­ing tilted over­whelm­ingly to­wards Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, it is faced with the prospect of hav­ing mis­cal­cu­lated on its choice, with pres­i­den­tial con­tender Joe Bi­den ris­ing in pop­u­lar­ity. While New Delhi has plenty of con­nec­tions to the Bi­den crowd, many of them are Obama-era holdovers, which sits un­com­fort­ably with it.</p>
    <p>Also, In­dia still pos­si­bly hopes that it can keep a mea­sure of its cher­ished strate­gic au­ton­omy. But for that it needs Bei­jing to re­lieve the pres­sure it has placed around its close neigh­bour­hood, in­clud­ing the con­tin­u­ing mil­i­tary stand-off in the high Hi­malayas where, after decades, the first shots in anger were re­cently fired.</p>
    <p>Given its rel­a­tive weak­ness in the power bal­ance, sus­tained pres­sure from China makes for a swifter In­dian drift into the US or­bit.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, mil­i­tary ties with the US are marked by two foun­da­tional agree­ments on lo­gis­tics ex­change and com­mu­ni­ca­tions shar­ing. And while it has dropped word that the third foun­da­tional agree­ment, Beca, short for Ba­sic Ex­change and Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment for GeoSpa­tial Co­op­er­a­tion, will be signed as well, it has yet to do so, al­though some re­ports sug­gest that this is im­mi­nent.</p>
    <p>ASIAN NATO IN THE WORKS?</p>
    <p>Still, all Quad mem­bers to­day are linked by bi­lat­eral sup­ply-shar­ing pacts and re­gard­less of whether Aus­tralia’s navy gets an In­dian in­vite to this year’s Ex­er­cise Mal­abar, or whether Mal­abar is held at all, the Covid-19 headache of­fers a valid ex­cuse – the di­rec­tion of the drift to­wards an Asian Nato is dis­cernible.</p>
    <p>“At the ap­pro­pri­ate time, once we’ve in­sti­tu­tion­alised what we’re do­ing, the four of us to­gether, we can be­gin to build out a true se­cu­rity frame­work, a fab­ric that can counter the chal­lenge that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party presents to all of us,” Mr Pom­peo told Nikkei Asia in Tokyo dur­ing an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>His deputy, Mr Stephen Biegun, had hinted at what a for­malised Quad could look like last month when he noted at a sem­i­nar that the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion did not have “strong mul­ti­lat­eral struc­tures”.</p>
    <p>“They don’t have any­thing of the for­ti­tude of Nato, or the Euro­pean Union… There is cer­tainly an in­vi­ta­tion there at some point to for­malise a struc­ture like this,” he said.</p>
    <p>While Ja­panese For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi said the Quad min­is­ters agreed to meet ev­ery year, the In­dian ex­ter­nal af­fairs min­istry merely said the for­eign min­is­ters would hold the con­sul­ta­tions “reg­u­larly”.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi also said the group would wel­come other coun­tries join­ing in, pos­si­bly mean­ing South Korea and In­done­sia, as well as France and Ger­many – two Euro­pean pow­ers mov­ing rapidly on the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, it may be pre­ma­ture to think of Asean states mak­ing such a move at this point. At a we­bi­nar last week, the French am­bas­sador to In­dia, a coun­try with which the French mil­i­tary has rapidly scaled up ex­changes, skirted around the ques­tion of whether France would con­sider par­tic­i­pat­ing in an ex­panded Quad. In­stead, he chose to talk of his nation tak­ing a “prin­ci­pled po­si­tion” on re­gional events.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, Bei­jing has much to pon­der. For now, there is no talk of set­ting up a Quad “head­quar­ters”, only about ini­tia­tives on vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and build­ing re­silient sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>BABY STEPS</p>
    <p>Sev­eral so-called Quad Plus meet­ings fo­cus­ing on the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have al­ready been held with coun­tries like South Korea, Viet­nam and New Zealand. Those baby steps could lead to some­thing big­ger.</p>
    <p>This weekend, New Zealand, a mem­ber of the Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence gath­er­ing net­work of na­tions, holds its elec­tions. Bei­jing will not be dis­pleased if New Zealand First, a key mem­ber of the Labour-led coali­tion gov­ern­ment, slips in the polls as it is tipped to do.</p>
    <p>Un­der NZ First nom­i­nated deputy PM Win­ston Peters, who also is for­eign min­is­ter, New Zealand sur­prised many ear­lier this year by en­dors­ing Aus­tralian PM Scott Mor­ri­son’s call for an in­quiry into how China han­dled the virus out­break in Wuhan. He also called for Tai­wan to be al­lowed to par­tic­i­pate in a Covid-19 con­fer­ence or­gan­ised by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. New Zealand also joined 38 other coun­tries re­cently in is­su­ing a strong state­ment crit­i­cis­ing China over Xin­jiang and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Even if Mr Peters’ party does badly, opin­ion in New Zealand has shifted in the wake of the pan­demic. Lately, some Kiwi voices have been talk­ing of a “Quad Plus One” for­mula that would bring Welling­ton closer to the Quad.</p>
    <p>The im­pres­sive US re­sponse to the South-east Asian tsunami of De­cem­ber 2004, with back­ing help from the In­dian mil­i­tary, was one of the early ex­am­ples of the po­ten­tial of such co­op­er­a­tion, al­beit in a peace­ful way. Since then, much wa­ter has flowed un­der the bridge of strate­gic em­braces.</p>
    <p>As much as they dis­like be­ing the stuff­ing in the sand­wich of US-China com­pe­ti­tion, many Asian states are watch­ing to see which way the wind blows post the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, to de­cide on where pre­cisely they want to stand on this axis and whether the time is com­ing to ad­just po­si­tions a mite.</p>
    <p>A nudge here and a nudge there and be­fore you know it, there’s enough mo­men­tum for a shove. Keep an eye on the jostling!</p>
