    <p>Paul Pogba is “un­happy” at Manch­ester United and should leave in the next trans­fer win­dow, his agent Mino Raiola has said, in com­ments that may sig­nal the exit of the one-time world’s most ex­pen­sive player.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian claimed the World Cup-win­ning French­man needs a “change of scene” after strug­gling to es­tab­lish him­self un­der man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>Pogba has made only five starts in the Premier League and one in the Cham­pi­ons League this sea­son, open­ing his ac­count for the league cam­paign last week­end at West Ham.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son was equally frus­trat­ing for the 27-year-old, who made just 16 top-flight ap­pear­ances due to in­juries. With his con­tract set to ex­pire in the sum­mer of 2022, Raiola hinted it was time for his client to move on.</p>
    <p>“Paul’s un­happy at Manch­ester United, he can’t ex­press him­self any more as he would like to and as</p>
    <p>we ex­pect of him,” he told Ital­ian news­pa­per Tut­tosport.</p>
    <p>“He has to change teams, he needs a change of scene. His con­tract is up in a year-and-a-half, in 2022, but I think the best so­lu­tion for all sides is a trans­fer in the next win­dow (in Jan­uary).”</p>
    <p>He added that Pogba, who re­turned from a spell at Ju­ven­tus for a then world record fee of £89 mil­lion (S$158.6 mil­lion) in 2016, had no plans to ex­tend his con­tract.</p>
    <p>“The club... knows it risks los­ing him for noth­ing, as at the mo­ment the player has no in­ten­tion of ex­tend­ing his con­tract,” Raiola said. “If any­one doesn’t un­der­stand, they don’t un­der­stand any­thing about foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>While Pogba, eclipsed since the Jan­uary ar­rival of Por­tu­gal mid­fielder Bruno Fer­nan­des, has re­peat­edly spo­ken of his frus­tra­tions at club level while on in­ter­na­tional duty, France coach Di­dier Deschamps on Mon­day re­fused to be drawn on Raiola’s com­ments.</p>
    <p>He told lo­cal TV chan­nel Tele­foot, fol­low­ing Les Bleus’ World Cup 2022 qual­i­fy­ing draw, that he would rather de­cline to “start to re­act to the words of the play­ers’ agents, their un­cle, their grand­mother or their dog.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, for­mer Liver­pool de­fender Jamie Car­ragher lam­basted Raiola and Pogba, call­ing the pair “a dis­grace”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on Sky’s Mon­day Night Foot­ball show, the pun­dit said: “Get rid, I have been say­ing this for 12 months, he is the most over­rated player I have seen in my life.</p>
    <p>“Agents in this day and age are not just agents, they are a par­ent, a best friend, a fi­nan­cial ad­viser, they book hol­i­days, go away with each other. So Pogba will be well aware of what was go­ing to come out of his mouth. And if he wasn’t, he should sack his agent.”</p>
