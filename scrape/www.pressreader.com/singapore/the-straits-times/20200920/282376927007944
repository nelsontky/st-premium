    <p>Over­seas pro­pos­als and birth­day trips may have been scup­pered due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but a sun­set cruise aboard lux­ury sail­ing ship Royal Al­ba­tross is a unique and dreamy al­ter­na­tive.</p>
    <p>Birth­day cel­e­bra­tions take place al­most ev­ery night and pro­pos­als about once a week on the sail­ing ship, which re­sumed sun­set din­ner cruises this month.</p>
    <p>My 5pm cruise on a Satur­day evening, the ship’s most pop­u­lar times­lot, is fully booked at 50 per­sons, down from an av­er­age of 130 pre-pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Board­ing starts about 45 min­utes be­fore de­par­ture from a berth out­side Sen­tosa’s Ad­ven­ture Cove Water­park, so come early to pick your seat.</p>
    <p>Ta­bles at the bow of­fer an un­blocked view, while those at the stern are close to the pop­u­lar and highly In­sta­grammable fly­ing seat, an el­e­vated bench back­dropped by the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>It is grey and driz­zly, like many other Septem­ber evenings, but awnings keep the rain out – though they also ob­scure our view of the four masts and 22 sails the ship is known for.</p>
    <p>Built in 2001 in the United States, the ship’s sails and rig­ging were de­signed by master rig­ger Jim Barry, who is be­hind the ships fea­tured in the Pirates Of The Caribbean movies.</p>
    <p>In 2008, it ap­peared in The Dark Knight as the pri­vate yacht of Bat­man’s al­ter ego, Bruce Wayne.</p>
    <p>The same year, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and founder of Royal Al­ba­tross Peter Pela bought over the ship, pump­ing in mil­lions of dol­lars and about 360,000 man-hours to trans­form it into the lux­ury sail­ing ship of the present.</p>
    <p>It is money well spent, for the yacht sails beau­ti­fully. It slips noise­lessly from the dock and we glide past fa­mil­iar land­marks such as Univer­sal Stu­dios and Sin­ga­pore Cruise Cen­tre with ease.</p>
    <p>We pass Sen­tosa’s tri­fecta of beaches, yachts berthed at One15 Ma­rina and bun­ga­lows at Sen­tosa Cove. It all feels very Crazy Rich Asians.</p>
    <p>Amid the gawk­ing, wait­ers serve a three-course din­ner where my smoked salmon roulade, panseared hal­ibut and cap­puc­cino mocha mousse are tasty, if not the most mem­o­rable. A menu re­vamp is un­der way, helmed by a new chef who will in­clude more Asian in­flu­ences into the dishes.</p>
    <p>Be­tween the food, view and pos­ing for pic­tures, there is plenty to keep guests en­ter­tained. No­body seems to mind that en­ter­tain­ment such as a live band, or watch­ing ad­ven­tur­ous guests take on the mast climb (and some­times pro­pose up there), has been tem­po­rar­ily halted.</p>
    <p>In­stead, we wave at sun-kissed leisure-seek­ers on plea­sure craft and peo­ple camp­ing and fish­ing on St John’s Is­land.</p>
    <p>Golden hour de­scends on our re­turn jour­ney to Sen­tosa. The 21/ 2- hour sail is over too soon.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all other guests have dis­em­barked – group by group, in ac­cor­dance with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures – staff bring out a bou­quet for a woman. Her part­ner goes down on one knee.</p>
    <p>And, of course, she says yes.</p>
