    <p>Indonesia’s Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day re­placed six of his 34 Cab­i­net min­is­ters in a ma­jor reshuf­fle that in­cluded the health min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Budi Gu­nadi Sadikin, a deputy min­is­ter for state-owned en­ter­prises who also leads the na­tional eco­nomic re­cov­ery task force, is the new health min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Other port­fo­lios af­fected in­clude tourism, re­li­gious af­fairs and trade.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day re­placed six min­is­ters in a Cab­i­net reshuf­fle aimed at help­ing Indonesia re­cover from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has plunged the coun­try i nto its first re­ces­sion since the 1998 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Budi Gu­nadi Sadikin, a deputy state-owned en­ter­prises min­is­ter who also leads the na­tional eco­nomic re­cov­ery task force, has been named the new health min­is­ter to re­place Dr Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto.</p>
    <p>Mr San­di­aga Uno, a f ormer Jakarta vice-gover­nor who con­tested the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion as a run­ning mate to Mr Joko’s ri­val, Mr Prabowo Su­bianto, has been ap­pointed tourism and cre­ative econ­omy min­is­ter, re­plac­ing Mr Wish­nu­tama Kusuban­dio.</p>
    <p>Mr Prabowo is Indonesia’s cur­rent de­fence min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko has also re­placed two min­is­ters ar­rested for al­leged fraud: Mr Sakti Wahyu Treng­gono has been ap­pointed mar­itime af­fairs and fish­eries min­is­ter to re­place Edhy Prabowo. And Surabaya Mayor Tri Ris­ma­harini will be the new so­cial af­fairs min­is­ter, re­plac­ing Ju­liari Batubara.</p>
    <p>The new re­li­gious af­fairs min­is­ter is Mr Yaqut Cho­lil Qoumas, leader of the An­sor youth wing of Nahd­latul Ulama, Indonesia’s big­gest Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tion, and also a Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The trade min­is­ter has also been re­placed with Mr Muham­mad Lutfi, the cur­rent Am­bas­sador to the United States.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net com­prises 34 min­is­ters, ex­clud­ing Mr Joko and VicePres­i­dent Ma’ruf Amin.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko, or Jokowi as he is bet­ter known, did not com­ment af­ter nam­ing the new min­is­ters. How­ever, he wrote on Facebook: “What’s past is past, to live as mem­o­ries and les­sons. We look to to­mor­row with de­ter­mi­na­tion, en­thu­si­asm and new hope.”</p>
    <p>He wrote in a sep­a­rate post­ing later: “Hope­fully these six new min­is­ters will bring new en­thu­si­asm and new hope, for us, for the peo­ple, and for the na­tion.”</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ra­tion of the new min­is­ters will be held to­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko had threat­ened a min­is­te­rial shake-up as early as June, when he rep­ri­manded his min­is­ters for their lack­lus­tre han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic in Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous na­tion of 270 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The dis­ease has in­fected 678,125 peo­ple and killed 20,257 in Indonesia as at yes­ter­day – the high­est in South-east Asia on both counts.</p>
    <p>In­com­ing Health Min­is­ter Budi is ex­pected to chart a new course of ac­tion and com­mit­ments to mit­i­gate the health and eco­nomic im­pacts of Covid-19 in South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The for­mer banker, listed as one of The Straits Times 50 Asians to Watch in 2018, is known to pos­sess strong man­age­ment skills, which may be valu­able when deal­ing with such is­sues as dis­burse­ment of health bud­gets and dis­tri­bu­tion of health­care re­sources.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to his ap­point­ment, Mr Budi said that an in­clu­sive ap­proach would be nec­es­sary to tackle the health cri­sis and re­vive the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve it won’t be enough for the gov­ern­ment to ini­ti­ate its own pro­grammes. It takes a move­ment that must be car­ried out by all In­done­sian peo­ple,” he said in his re­marks at the pres­i­den­tial palace. “I be­lieve if we are united with as­so­ci­a­tions, re­gional gov­ern­ments and all el­e­ments, we can build a strong pub­lic health sys­tem and be ready to tackle the prob­lems caused by Sars-CoV-2.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­like his pre­de­ces­sors who were from the med­i­cal back­ground, Mr Budi’s ap­point­ment has stirred con­cerns. It is ex­pected that he will have a deputy to help fill him in on the med­i­cal as­pects of the job.</p>
    <p>Dr Pandu Riono, a well-known epi­demi­ol­o­gist from the Univer­sity of Indonesia and a staunch critic of the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the pan­demic, had praised Mr Budi in a re­cent Twit­ter post. He said Mr Budi has a “vi­sion and spirit to over­come the pan­demic quickly” with his goal to vac­ci­nate 16 mil­lion peo­ple each month, adding: “It does not nec­es­sar­ily take a doc­tor to re­form the paral­ysed pub­lic health man­age­ment and sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Mr San­di­aga, ac­knowl­edg­ing that he has just re­cov­ered from Covid-19, de­scribed his new role as “a very hard task”. But he said he be­lieved that the tourism and cre­ative econ­omy would be the driver of eco­nomic re­cov­ery in the pan­demic’s af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>“The strat­egy that we can adopt is in­no­va­tion by way of tech­nol­ogy... as well as to en­sure busi­ness play­ers in the tourism and cre­ative econ­omy not only sur­vive, but also thrive,” he said.</p>
    <p>LOOK FOR­WARD, NOT BACK</p>
    <p>What’s past is past, to live as mem­o­ries and les­sons. We look to to­mor­row with de­ter­mi­na­tion, en­thu­si­asm and new hope.</p>
