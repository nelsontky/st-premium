    <p>For those think­ing of get­ting a new mon­i­tor, here are eight buy­ing con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>1. The mon­i­tor’s main role</p>
    <p>The first thing you need to de­cide is the mon­i­tor’s pri­mary role.</p>
    <p>Is it for day-to-day com­put­ing tasks such as edit­ing doc­u­ments? Or is it for gam­ing?</p>
    <p>While a stan­dard mon­i­tor can han­dle most tasks ad­e­quately, more spe­cialised tasks such as photo or video edit­ing may re­quire spe­cific fea­tures, such as a wide colour gamut.</p>
    <p>2. Screen size and res­o­lu­tion</p>
    <p>The most pop­u­lar mon­i­tor screen sizes in Sin­ga­pore are 24 and 27 inches, say man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>A larger screen gen­er­ally lets you view more in­for­ma­tion, but do not ne­glect screen res­o­lu­tion as it af­fects the clar­ity of im­ages.</p>
    <p>A 27-inch mon­i­tor with a 1,920 x 1,080-pixel or 1,080p res­o­lu­tion, for in­stance, is not as sharp as a 24-inch one with the same res­o­lu­tion. Hence, the for­mer may not be ideal for text-heavy ap­pli­ca­tions. How­ever, gamers may pre­fer a lower res­o­lu­tion so as to max­imise graph­ics per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, a 4K res­o­lu­tion on a 27-inch screen may re­sult in text and ob­jects ap­pear­ing too small, though this can be rec­ti­fied in the com­puter set­tings.</p>
    <p>Given the same screen size, a higher-res­o­lu­tion mon­i­tor is likely to be more ex­pen­sive than an­other with a lower res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>3. As­pect ra­tio</p>
    <p>While most mon­i­tors have a 16:9 as­pect ra­tio, ul­tra-wide mod­els with a 21:9 or 32:9 as­pect ra­tio are see­ing trac­tion as a sin­gle ul­trawide mon­i­tor can re­place two or even three mon­i­tors and elim­i­nates un­sightly screen bezels between mul­ti­ple mon­i­tors.</p>
    <p>4. Bright­ness</p>
    <p>Most mon­i­tors of­fer 300 to 400 nits of bright­ness. With high dy­namic range (HDR) con­tent in­creas­ingly avail­able for com­put­ers, the Video Elec­tron­ics Stan­dards As­so­ci­a­tion has cre­ated the Dis­playHDR stan­dard to in­form con­sumers if a mon­i­tor is ca­pa­ble of show­ing HDR con­tent prop­erly.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral tiers in the Dis­playHDR stan­dard. For in­stance, the en­try-level Dis­playHDR 400 spec­i­fi­ca­tion man­dates a min­i­mum peak bright­ness of 400 nits and a stan­dard colour gamut.</p>
    <p>If HDR, which is also sup­ported in game con­soles, is im­por­tant to you, pick a mon­i­tor with the Dis­playHDR 1000 cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, which spec­i­fies a peak bright­ness of 1,000 nits and a wide colour gamut.</p>
    <p>5. Type of panel</p>
    <p>The panel tech­nol­ogy used by mon­i­tors af­fects view­ing an­gles and im­age qual­ity.</p>
    <p>In-plane switch­ing (IPS) mon­i­tors of­fer wide view­ing an­gles (up to 178 de­grees) and good im­age qual­ity.</p>
    <p>Twisted ne­matic (TN) screens are cheaper and have low re­sponse times that are de­sired by gamers as they re­duce mo­tion blur.</p>
    <p>Ver­ti­cal align­ment (VA) pan­els usu­ally of­fer the best con­trast ra­tio and im­age qual­ity, but they have a long re­sponse time and their view­ing an­gles are not as wide as those of IPS screens.</p>
    <p>For most us­age sce­nar­ios, The Straits Times’ rec­om­men­da­tion is to go with an IPS mon­i­tor, for its bal­anced char­ac­ter­is­tics. IPS mon­i­tors have an im­age qual­ity that is close to that of VA screens, while their re­sponse time is be­com­ing low enough to com­pete with TN dis­plays.</p>
    <p>6. Mon­i­tor cur­va­ture</p>
    <p>Curved mon­i­tors are said to of­fer a more im­mer­sive ex­pe­ri­ence and strain the eyes less. They also tend to have a large screen so that they can bet­ter en­ve­lope a user’s field of vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The amount of cur­va­ture is typ­i­cally rep­re­sented as a fig­ure such as 1,800R, which means the mon­i­tor is as curved as a cir­cle with a 1,800mm ra­dius. A lower fig­ure means a more pro­nounced curve.</p>
    <p>7. Re­fresh rate</p>
    <p>A mon­i­tor’s re­fresh rate de­ter­mines how of­ten it up­dates the im­age on the screen. A stan­dard mon­i­tor with a 60Hz re­fresh rate re­draws im­ages 60 times in a sec­ond.</p>
    <p>A higher re­fresh rate makes play­ing games and nav­i­gat­ing the com­puter in­ter­face feel smoother and more fluid.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing this a step fur­ther (and rais­ing the price tag) are mon­i­tors with vari­able or adap­tive re­fresh rate tech­nolo­gies such as AMD’s FreeSync and Nvidia’s G-Sync. Th­ese fea­tures, which re­quire a com­pat­i­ble AMD or Nvidia graph­ics card, con­stantly ad­just the mon­i­tor’s re­fresh rate to match a game’s frame rates so as to re­duce screen tear­ing – where hor­i­zon­tal lines break up an im­age.</p>
    <p>8. Ports and con­nec­tors</p>
    <p>Mon­i­tors typ­i­cally come with HDMI and Dis­playPort con­nec­tors. They may also have a USB hub to sup­port mul­ti­ple USB de­vices and built-in speak­ers for au­dio play­back.</p>
    <p>There are dif­fer­ent gen­er­a­tions for HDMI and Dis­playPort that vary in ca­pa­bil­i­ties. For in­stance, HDMI 2.0 and Dis­playPort 1.4 have more band­width that en­ables higher res­o­lu­tions and higher re­fresh rates than older ver­sions.</p>
    <p>Nvidia’s G-Sync tech­nol­ogy also re­quires a Dis­playPort 1.2 con­nec­tor while AMD’s FreeSync can work with HDMI.</p>
    <p>Newer (and more pre­mium) mon­i­tors of­ten come with a USB-C port that can be used to de­liver power as well as carry au­dio and video sig­nals.</p>
