    <p>The cur­rent Covid-19 cri­sis has led to more peo­ple cy­cling, ei­ther for recre­ation or as a means of trans­port. This is gen­er­ally good news, but we should also make sure the roads re­main safe for all users.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a small place and the pre­cious space we have has to be care­fully planned so that pedes­tri­ans, cy­clists and mo­torists can co­ex­ist in peace.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, most users are not ma­li­cious and are quite care­ful. But with the in­creas­ing vol­ume in traf­fic, the small pro­por­tion of users mis­be­hav­ing has caused more and more harm.</p>
    <p>We still see per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vice (PMD) riders hurtling at breakneck speeds, and we have al­ready seen what harm they can do to pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>We also see cy­clists rid­ing two or even three abreast, and they can get ag­gres­sive when told to obey traf­fic rules. This oc­curs even on small roads where it is im­pos­si­ble to pass them. Oth­ers may fol­low far too closely be­hind ve­hi­cles at high speeds, and if the ve­hi­cles brake, there will be no time to stop and we have seen videos posted of badly in­jured cy­clists.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor­cy­clists are also guilty of lane split­ting at high speeds, while cars have been tak­ing ad­van­tage of the re­duced traf­fic to speed reck­lessly. All th­ese should stop, and the au­thor­i­ties need to step up enforcemen­t.</p>
    <p>One big bug­bear is that cy­clists and even many PMD users are not reg­is­tered or have in­sur­ance. This makes for poor ac­count­abil­ity, and there are peo­ple who have taken ad­van­tage of this loop­hole.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists are all re­quired to carry a li­cence, be reg­is­tered and pay for in­sur­ance in case of dam­age to per­sons or prop­erty.</p>
    <p>For all road users to ex­ist in safety and har­mony, we need to re­in­force traf­fic rules, plan spa­ces for dif­fer­ent types of users and make sure every user is reg­is­tered and has in­sur­ance.</p>
