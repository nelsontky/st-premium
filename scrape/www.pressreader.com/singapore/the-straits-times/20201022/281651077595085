    <p>Kloud Karaoke Lounge has not been able to re­open for about half a year since the two-month cir­cuit breaker that started in April, on ac­count of gov­ern­ment con­cerns that nightlife set­tings such as clubs and karaoke lounges are high-risk ar­eas for Covid-19 to spread.</p>
    <p>And it might just re­main that way per­ma­nently next month if things do not im­prove, as the pan­demic drags on and rental costs for the four-year-old karaoke lounge in Tan­jong Ka­tong snow­ball.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day there is a de­lay, we have to bear with the rental,” said Mr Ron­ald Ng, Kloud Karaoke Lounge’s direc­tor. “Our land­lords chase us for rental... and it’s not a small sum... I don’t know whether we can hold on un­til next month.”</p>
    <p>Things are getting dire for some nightlife op­er­a­tors with no cer­tainty on when they can re­open, since gov­ern­ment up­dates on Tues­day sug­gest their busi­nesses can­not re­sume even at the start of phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, which could hap­pen by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>And piv­ot­ing to other lines of busi­ness to re­main afloat has been very chal­leng­ing for many, for var­i­ous rea­sons.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported in Au­gust that a poll by the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion and the Sin­ga­pore En­ter­tain­ment Af­fil­i­a­tion, which rep­re­sents karaoke op­er­a­tors, found that less than 10 per cent of re­spon­dents said they would sur­vive to the end of this month.</p>
    <p>While larger busi­nesses are able to bear the fi­nan­cial costs of re­tool­ing, smaller ones such as en­ter­tain­ment com­pany A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive are feel­ing the pinch.</p>
    <p>Co-founder Francesca Way and her col­leagues have been work­ing to turn their two bars – nine­teen80 and Pin­ball Wiz­ard – into food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>Ms Way cited con­cerns in bear­ing the fi­nan­cial costs of piv­ot­ing, as well as dif­fi­cul­ties in getting the proper li­cences.</p>
    <p>“Build­ing some­thing like a kitchen set-up costs over five fig­ures,” she added.</p>
    <p>The com­pany be­gan the trans­for­ma­tion in Au­gust and ap­plied for a change of li­cence last month, but the com­plex na­ture of li­cens­ing and the fact that the process is man­aged by mul­ti­ple agen­cies mean things can be slow go­ing.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral karaoke op­er­a­tors, who are sur­viv­ing on their dwin­dling re­serves, also cite dif­fi­cul­ties in getting ap­provals to con­vert their busi­ness li­cences and space con­straints in chang­ing up their trade.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who is also chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore En­ter­tain­ment Af­fil­i­a­tion, which has more than 100 mem­bers, said piv­ot­ing was harder for karaoke lounges as com­pared with pubs and bars be­cause of their lack of food and bev­er­age ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>He said turn­ing his karaoke lounge into an of­fice for rent is not a long-term or vi­able so­lu­tion be­cause other places that can serve sim­i­lar func­tions, such as li­braries, have opened up.</p>
    <p>Direc­tor of Teo Heng KTV Stu­dio Jean Teo said that chang­ing how the chain’s premises can be used is not a straight­for­ward process.</p>
    <p>If the use of the premises is changed and Teo Heng wants to later ap­ply to re­verse this to re­turn to the karaoke busi­ness, there is a risk the ap­pli­ca­tion will be re­jected.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar karaoke chain has shut­tered two of its 14 out­lets since March 27.</p>
    <p>With a soft spot for its em­ploy­ees, the com­pany has paid them full salaries with Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions for the past six months. But high losses led to em­ployer and em­ploy­ees jointly de­cid­ing to take a 50 per cent pay cut as of this month to help tide the com­pany over this dif­fi­cult pe­riod. There are plans to pay this back.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ng: “The two op­tions given by the Gov­ern­ment are that if you don’t pivot, you exit. But piv­ot­ing is not for the whole in­dus­try.”</p>
