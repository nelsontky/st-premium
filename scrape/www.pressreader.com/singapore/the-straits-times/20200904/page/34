    <h3>TEACHER&#x27;S DAY</h3>
    <p>
        THE STRAITS TIMES B12 FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2020 | | | TEACHERS’ DAY - SHAPING LIVES BEYOND THE CLASSROOM When the circuit breaker hit, pre-school teacher June Ng had to make drastic changes to her teaching methods, which included conducting classes through Zoom – W To make up for the lack of face-to-face interactio­n during online classes, two Chinese language teachers created fun videos and learning materials to engage the kids – If your kids love eating
(rice dumplings), for example, you could make dumplings together with them, while telling them about the Dragon Boat Festival. That will also allow them to learn more about Chinese culture. zong zi F A good way to encourage your pre-schooler’s interest and competency in the language is to expose them to a wide variety of materials, such as poems, tongue twisters, cartoons and songs. These will not only entertain them, but also develop their reading and listening skills. 大家好 PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY .
