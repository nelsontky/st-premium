    <p>Co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties (CCAs) have been forced to take a back­seat this year, but stu­dents’ records will not be un­duly pe­nalised, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) has said.</p>
    <p>As long as stu­dents have been se­lected to rep­re­sent their schools for a com­pe­ti­tion or event, they will be recog­nised, even if the oc­ca­sion did not take place.</p>
    <p>Other ad­just­ments have been made this year to Leaps 2.0, a frame­work that as­sesses stu­dents’ de­vel­op­ment out­side the class­room, said Mrs Tan Chen Kee, divi­sional direc­tor of MOE’s stu­dent de­vel­op­ment cur­ricu­lum di­vi­sion, in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>From June, schools have also come up with cre­ative ways to con­duct en­rich­ment pro­grammes, like vir­tual CCA ses­sions and class­based ac­tiv­i­ties, while ad­her­ing to safe man­age­ment rules.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary schools, ju­nior col­leges and Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute were also given the green light to re­sume cer­tain CCAs from July 27, pro­vided they keep to a max­i­mum of 20 stu­dents for each ac­tiv­ity, and where pos­si­ble, fix stu­dent group­ings to min­imise in­ter­min­gling.</p>
    <p>But ac­tiv­i­ties that in­volve high lev­els of body con­tact, such as taek­wondo spar­ring and rugby scrums, or high ex­po­sure to aerosol and splat­ters, such as play­ing wind in­stru­ments or singing in a choir, will re­main sus­pended.</p>
    <p>CCAs had been put on hold since March as schools im­ple­mented safe man­age­ment pre­cau­tions. Com­pe­ti­tions like the Na­tional School Games were also cancelled.</p>
    <p>But with the spe­cial al­lowances this year, Mrs Tan said the per­cent­age of stu­dents who will at­tain ei­ther one or two bonus points this year is pro­jected to re­main sim­i­lar to pre­vi­ous years. These points are used by sec­ondary school stu­dents for ad­mis­sion to ju­nior col­leges, poly­tech­nics and the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ad­her­ing to MOE’s pro­vi­sion on recog­nis­ing stu­dents who have been cho­sen to rep­re­sent their schools, ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tions will also recog­nise school, class and CCA-based lead­er­ship ap­point­ments, con­sid­er­ing how these re­spon­si­bil­i­ties might have been changed for mean­ing­ful learn­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, for uni­formed groups, stu­dents are al­lowed to pur­sue their rank pro­mo­tions and badges through on­line learn­ing mod­ules.</p>
    <p>CCA at­ten­dance will be pro-rated based on the to­tal num­ber of ses­sions con­ducted by the school. Stu­dents who were ab­sent with valid rea­sons due to dis­rup­tions caused by Covid-19 will not be pe­nalised.</p>
    <p>Time spent dis­cussing and plan­ning Val­ues-in-Ac­tion (VIA) projects – which are learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences meant to help stu­dents un­der­stand the needs of oth­ers and re­flect on what they have learnt – will also be counted even though these were sus­pended.</p>
    <p>MOE put on­line a les­son pack­age called VIA@Home to guide stu­dents to ex­plore al­ter­na­tive ways to con­trib­ute to their fam­ily and the com­mu­nity, Mrs Tan said.</p>
    <p>Show­ing care and ap­pre­ci­a­tion to front-line work­ers, and cre­at­ing sim­ple ac­tiv­i­ties to en­cour­age oth­ers to stay at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod were some ways sug­gested.</p>
    <p>Mr Jonathan Ram, Chua Chu Kang Sec­ondary School’s sub­ject head of phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion and CCAs, said stu­dents will not be short­changed in terms of hav­ing their CCA par­tic­i­pa­tion recog­nised.</p>
    <p>“It also doesn’t de­pend on one year of con­tri­bu­tion. There are other years to look at,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We are hop­ing for good news in time to come for CCAs to fully re­sume in-per­son, be­cause now we can’t start train­ing in big groups and we have no in­di­ca­tion as to when com­pe­ti­tions can start.”</p>
