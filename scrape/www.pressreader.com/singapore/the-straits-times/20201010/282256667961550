    <p>In the sweaty are­nas of sport, fair­ness is rarely found. If you’re a ju­doka, you’ll never earn like a foot­baller. If you’re a shooter, don’t wait to be asked for an au­to­graph. There is no level play­ing field, no gen­der equal­ity, no uni­form treat­ment. How much press you get can de­pend on the fluke of where you are born.</p>
    <p>There are only so many pages in a news­pa­per and so lit­tle at­ten­tion span in a world with a pref­er­ence for flash. It swoons over cross-cul­tural he­roes, prodi­gies and big-talk­ing Nick Kyr­gios. It falls for any­one who looks good on a bill­board or if you play with such artistry that bal­let crit­ics at a news­pa­per come to watch. It’s en­am­oured with moth­ers who can play and in­trigued by those who have a hec­tor­ing father.</p>
    <p>But what hap­pens if you’re not any of this? Not an over-hyped, shot-mak­ing head-turner? Not too tall, not too young, not too heavy a hit­ter? Then you bet­ter win, again and again, to grab your share of at­ten­tion and this is pre­cisely what Sofia Kenin – 1.70m, 21, with a 146kmh av­er­age first-serve speed – is do­ing. Just inch­ing her way up the lad­der of re­spect. One hard rung at a time.</p>
    <p>She’s the reign­ing Aus­tralian Open cham­pion, is in the fi­nal at Roland Gar­ros, is the high­est-ranked Amer­i­can on any Tour and yet peo­ple might strug­gle to pick her out of a tal­ented line-up.</p>
    <p>It’s not her fault, it’s our sub-stan­dard radar. We’re look­ing for colour­ful stars but she’s just a plainly bril­liant tennis player.</p>
    <p>Kenin’s tennis speaks for her and it talks smartly and sternly. This isn’t a charm con­test, it’s a puz­zle-fest, and she’s a mo­bile prob­lem solver. Four of her matches went to three sets and she won those third sets 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 and 6-0 and it re­flects her tough­ness. Asked to describe her­self at a press con­fer­ence, she replied: “Feisty. One word, very feisty... Def­i­nitely feisty.”</p>
    <p>Kenin shouts, self-chats, seem­ingly reads where the ball is go­ing be­fore the hit­ter de­cides the di­rec­tion, and stands steady dur­ing gales of shot-mak­ing. In her semi-fi­nal, Pe­tra Kvi­tova had 12 break points but could con­vert only two. When the match ended, a high-strung Kenin blew out her cheeks, as if she fi­nally gave her­self per­mis­sion to breathe.</p>
    <p>Of course, ev­ery­one wants spon­sors and In­sta­gram fol­low­ers (Coco Gauff has 686,970, Bianca An­dreescu 668,928, Kenin 180,319) but first in sport is re­spect. “I feel like peo­ple def­i­nitely re­spect me and I’m happy,” said Kenin. But you know it’s in­suf­fi­cient. It’s not just that she be­lieves in her­self, she wants to make you a be­liever.</p>
    <p>So does her ri­val, a Pol­ish 19-year-old named Iga (Swiatek) who one might say is an heir to an Aga (Rad­wan­ska). The lat­ter played a game of non-vi­o­lence, the for­mer hits fore­hands that verge on as­sault. Swiatek also un­der­stands un­fair­ness and ap­pre­ci­ates the nu­ances of ge­og­ra­phy, op­por­tu­nity and re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>“It was pretty an­noy­ing at the be­gin­ning. I just had to ac­cept if you’re from east­ern or cen­tral Europe it may be kind of harder to get wild cards be­cause we don’t have any big tour­na­ments in Poland,” she said.</p>
    <p>“As soon as I ac­cepted that and as soon as I re­alised it’s go­ing to be even bet­ter if I’m go­ing to earn it on my own, I was OK with that. I just kept work­ing.” Of course she did. Her father rowed the quadru­ple sculls over 2,000m at the 1988 Olympics and it’s a race of ut­ter per­sis­tence.</p>
    <p>Who’s play­ing in the fi­nal, ca­sual fans ask at the end of Slams, search­ing for leg­ends, come­back queens and record break­ers. These two women are yet to qual­ify un­der those cat­e­gories, but what a duet they prom­ise.</p>
    <p>One player, born in War­saw, whose cap is pulled low over her eyes yet owns a game that is scarcely shy. Swiatek is a retro teen, who trav­els with a sports psy­chol­o­gist, likes Pink Floyd and knows she is a win away from es­cap­ing the dark side of the moon.</p>
    <p>The other is an Amer­i­can born in Moscow, who walks across the court with the brisk­ness of a woman who is late to her own corona­tion. When she tosses the ball, Kenin famously doesn’t look up, but it’s be­cause she knows pre­cisely where she is go­ing. If she wins a sec­ond Slam, the world must pay at­ten­tion. That, at least, sounds like a fair deal.</p>
    <p>Kenin’s the reign­ing Aus­tralian Open cham­pion, is in the fi­nal at Roland Gar­ros, is the high­est-ranked Amer­i­can on any Tour and yet peo­ple might strug­gle to pick her out of a tal­ented line-up. It’s not her fault, it’s our sub-stan­dard radar. We’re look­ing for colour­ful stars but she’s just a plainly bril­liant tennis player.</p>
