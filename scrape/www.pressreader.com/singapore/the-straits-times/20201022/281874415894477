    <p>WASH­ING­TON The United States has sued Google, ac­cus­ing the US$1 tril­lion (S$1.36 tril­lion) In­ter­net gi­ant of il­le­gally us­ing its mar­ket mus­cle to hob­ble ri­vals, in the big­gest chal­lenge to the power and in­flu­ence of Big Tech in decades.</p>
    <p>The Jus­tice Depart­ment law­suit could lead to the break-up of an iconic com­pany that has be­come all but syn­ony­mous with the In­ter­net. The case may take years to re­solve.</p>
    <p>Tues­day’s law­suit marks the first time the US has cracked down on a ma­jor tech firm since it sued Mi­crosoft over anti-com­pet­i­tive prac­tices in 1998.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s com­plaint against Google’s par­ent, Al­pha­bet Inc, al­leges that Google acted un­law­fully to main­tain its po­si­tion in search and search ad­ver­tis­ing on the In­ter­net. The com­plaint was joined by 11 states.</p>
    <p>“Ab­sent a court or­der, Google will con­tinue ex­e­cut­ing its anti-com­pet­i­tive strat­egy, crip­pling the com­pet­i­tive process, re­duc­ing con­sumer choice and sti­fling in­no­va­tion,” the law­suit states.</p>
    <p>It said Google has nearly 90 per cent of all gen­eral search en­gine queries in the US and al­most 95 per cent of searches on mobile.</p>
    <p>At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Bill Barr said his in­ves­ti­ga­tors had found Google does not com­pete on the qual­ity of its search re­sults but bought its suc­cess through pay­ments to mobile phone mak­ers and others.</p>
    <p>“The end re­sult is that no one can fea­si­bly chal­lenge Google’s dom­i­nance in search and search ad­ver­tis­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>In its com­plaint, the Jus­tice Depart­ment said Amer­i­cans were hurt by Google’s ac­tions, adding that it was seek­ing “struc­tural re­lief as needed to cure any anti-com­pet­i­tive harm”. “Struc­tural re­lief” in an­titrust mat­ters gen­er­ally means the sale of an as­set.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, it is con­sumers and ad­ver­tis­ers that suf­fer from less choice, less in­no­va­tion and less com­pet­i­tive ad­ver­tis­ing prices,” the law­suit states.</p>
    <p>“So we are ask­ing the court to break Google’s grip on search dis­tri­bu­tion so the com­pe­ti­tion and in­no­va­tion can take hold.”</p>
    <p>Google called the law­suit “deeply flawed”, adding that peo­ple “use Google be­cause they choose to – not be­cause they’re forced to or be­cause they can’t find al­ter­na­tives”.</p>
    <p>In­vestors seemed to shrug off news of the law­suit, send­ing Al­pha­bet shares up 1.4 per cent to US$1,551 at the close on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s like lock­ing the prover­bial door af­ter the horse has bolted,” said Mr Neil Cam­pling, head of tech me­dia and tele­com re­search at Mirabaud Se­cu­ri­ties in Lon­don. He added Google has al­ready in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars in in­fra­struc­ture, tech­nolo­gies and tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“You can’t sim­ply un­wind a decade of sig­nif­i­cant progress.”</p>
    <p>The tim­ing of the suit, just days be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, could be seen as a po­lit­i­cal ges­ture since it ful­fils a prom­ise Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump made to his sup­port­ers to hold firms to ac­count for al­legedly sti­fling con­ser­va­tive voices.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans of­ten com­plain that so­cial me­dia firms in­clud­ing Google take ac­tion to re­duce the spread of con­ser­va­tive view­points on their plat­forms. Law­mak­ers have sought, with­out ex­plain­ing how, to use an­titrust laws to com­pel Big Tech to stop these al­leged lim­i­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>The com­plaint also pointed to the bil­lions of dol­lars that Google pays to smart­phone mak­ers such as Ap­ple, Sam­sung and others to make Google’s search en­gine the de­fault on their de­vices. This means that ri­val search en­gines never get the scale they need to im­prove their al­go­rithms, and grow, it said.</p>
    <p>Google has faced sim­i­lar le­gal chal­lenges over­seas.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union fined Google US$1.7 bil­lion last year for stop­ping web­sites from us­ing Google’s ri­vals to find ad­ver­tis­ers, US$2.6 bil­lion in 2017 for favour­ing its own shop­ping busi­ness i n search, and US$4.9 bil­lion in 2018 for block­ing ri­vals on its wire­less An­droid op­er­at­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>CON­SUMERS SUF­FER</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, it is con­sumers and ad­ver­tis­ers that suf­fer from less choice, less in­no­va­tion and less com­pet­i­tive ad­ver­tis­ing prices.</p>
    <p>THE UNITED STATES GOV­ERN­MENT, in the an­titrust law­suit against Google. It said Google has nearly 90 per cent of all gen­eral search en­gine queries in the US.</p>
    <p>Google called the law­suit “deeply flawed”, adding that peo­ple “use Google be­cause they choose to – not be­cause they’re forced to or be­cause they can’t find al­ter­na­tives”.</p>
