    <p>WASHINGTON • Officials at the Group of 20 (G-20) sum­mit meet­ing re­leased a clos­ing state­ment on Sun­day that served as per­haps the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s fi­nal re­minder of the wide gulf be­tween the United States and its al­lies on han­dling world­wide threats like the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, the group em­pha­sised what it called the “im­por­tant man­dates of the United Na­tions’ sys­tems and agen­cies, pri­mar­ily the WHO”, re­fer­ring to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, an agency Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­nounced a with­drawal from in July, threat­en­ing to cut off one of its largest sources of fund­ing.</p>
    <p>The state­ment, re­leased af­ter a two-day vir­tual meet­ing hosted by Saudi Ara­bia, said the group sup­ported strength­en­ing the WHO’s</p>
    <p>“over­all ef­fec­tive­ness in co­or­di­nat­ing and sup­port­ing the global re­sponse to the pan­demic and the cen­tral ef­forts of mem­ber states”.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the state­ment of­fered lit­tle in terms of any break­through an­nounce­ments be­yond gen­eral ap­peals for more global co­op­er­a­tion and “af­ford­able and eq­ui­table ac­cess” to ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The lack of more sig­nif­i­cant ini­tia­tives un­der­scored how dif­fi­cult it is for the G-20 to carry out an agenda when the US is in­dif­fer­ent – Mr Trump skipped part of the sum­mit to play golf – or even hos­tile to many of its po­si­tions, even dur­ing a pan­demic that has killed more than 1.3 mil­lion people glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The G-20’s clos­ing state­ment on Sun­day also re­ferred to other ar­eas where Mr Trump has caused fric­tion, call­ing cli­mate change one of “the most press­ing chal­lenges of our time” and say­ing that the Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity Board, a group of in­ter­na­tional reg­u­la­tors, was “con­tin­u­ing to ex­am­ine the fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity im­pli­ca­tions” of the is­sue.</p>
    <p>The US had re­sisted the in­clu­sion of cli­mate change in a joint dec­la­ra­tion of fi­nance min­is­ters this year but even­tu­ally re­lented.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has brushed aside dire pre­dic­tions about the ef­fects of cli­mate change and re­fused to ac­knowl­edge it as a man­made prob­lem, most re­cently re­moved sci­en­tist Michael Ku­per­berg who is re­spon­si­ble for the US’ Na­tional Cli­mate As­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s go-it-alone dy­namic has ham­pered con­fer­ences of global lead­ers since he took of­fice. Be­fore last year’s G-20 sum­mit in Osaka, Ja­pan, he set the tone by at­tack­ing Amer­ica’s clos­est al­lies, in­clud­ing the host coun­try.</p>
    <p>When he at­tended the 70th an­niver­sary of mil­i­tary al­liance Nato in Lon­don last year, he left abruptly af­ter an em­bar­rass­ing video of other world lead­ers pri­vately mock­ing him sur­faced.</p>
    <p>The lack of US lead­er­ship at such fo­rums comes as the world con­tin­ues to face se­vere eco­nomic strain from the pan­demic. Poor coun­tries have been par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble to the ef­fects of the virus.</p>
    <p>The World Bank es­ti­mated last month that the pan­demic could push more than 100 mil­lion people into ex­treme poverty this year.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the lead­ers threw their sup­port be­hind a new frame­work to pro­vide debt re­lief for poor coun­tries that have been hit hard by the pan­demic and re­it­er­ated their com­mit­ment to freez­ing bi­lat­eral debt pay­ments through June. More than 40 coun­tries have gained more than US$5 bil­lion (S$6.7 bil­lion) in im­me­di­ate debt pay­ment re­lief this year.</p>
    <p>US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin had al­ready backed the mea­sure but it was not clear if it was on Mr Trump’s radar.</p>
    <p>And, af­ter four years of the US Pres­i­dent shak­ing up the global or­der on in­ter­na­tional trade, the state­ment on Sun­day un­der­scored a com­mit­ment to the fu­ture of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, ex­pressed sup­port for a “mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem” and called for open mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Al­though there was no men­tion of tar­iffs, the lan­guage could be read as a re­buke to Mr Trump’s pen­chant for pro­tec­tion­ism and trade wars.</p>
