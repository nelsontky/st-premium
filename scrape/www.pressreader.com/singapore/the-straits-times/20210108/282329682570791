    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga promised yes­ter­day that the Olympic Games would be held this sum­mer al­though Tokyo has en­tered a sec­ond state of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who be­came Prime Min­is­ter last Septem­ber, told a press con­fer­ence: “I am de­ter­mined to hold a safe and se­cure Games.”</p>
    <p>He added that he is op­ti­mistic that en­thu­si­asm among the Ja­panese public will grow once vac­ci­na­tions be­gin, the Kyodo news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has been wors­en­ing since last month. The num­ber of daily con­firmed cases in Ja­pan sur­passed 7,000 for the first time, with 2,447 cases re­ported in Tokyo, set­ting a new high for the sec­ond day in a row, the state broad­caster NHK said.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga de­clared a state of emer­gency for the Tokyo met­ro­pol­i­tan area in­clud­ing Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and Kana­gawa pre­fec­tures yes­ter­day, au­tho­ris­ing tougher mea­sures to fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The state of emer­gency will be ef­fec­tive from to­day to Feb 7, with mea­sures in­clud­ing urg­ing peo­ple to stay home and call­ing for restau­rants and bars to stop serv­ing al­co­hol by 7 pm and close by 8pm.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of spec­ta­tors at live events, in­clud­ing sports events, will be lim­ited to half of the avail­able seats, and no greater than 5,000.</p>
    <p>That means that Ja­pan is in a race against time to en­sure that test events for the July 23-Aug 8 Olympics can restart on March 4 as resched­uled.</p>
    <p>The first will be the Fina artis­tic swim­ming Olympic qual­i­fi­ca­tion tour­na­ment from March 4 to 7 at the Tokyo Aquat­ics Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Over­seas ath­letes had been ex­pected to at­tend some of the test events.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the BBC, the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee “has full con­fi­dence in the Ja­panese au­thor­i­ties and the mea­sures they are tak­ing”.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo Met­ro­pol­i­tan Gov­ern­ment also an­nounced yes­ter­day that up­com­ing ex­hi­bi­tions of the Olympics torch around Tokyo have been post­poned “to re­duce the flow of peo­ple and the fur­ther spread of Covid-19”.</p>
