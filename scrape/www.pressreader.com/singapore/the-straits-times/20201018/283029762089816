    <p>“SEND HELP” and “FREE US” were writ­ten in sticky notes on the win­dows of a dor­mi­tory at the Univer­sity of Wis­con­sin-Madi­son, as a sound­track from The Purge movies – a se­ries of dystopian hor­ror films – boomed from an up­per floor.</p>
    <p>Fresh­men in py­ja­mas and masks darted up and down side­walks in driv­ing rain, haul­ing bags of groceries and bot­tles of al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>Fraz­zled par­ents waited in mini­vans as their chil­dren dragged be­long­ings out­side to evac­u­ate.</p>
    <p>The chaos erupted last month when the univer­sity an­nounced a lock­down of two large res­i­dence halls, each home to more than 1,000 stu­dents, af­ter lo­cal of­fi­cials de­manded ac­tion amid soar­ing coro­n­avirus caseloads.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents were told that they could not leave the build­ing, for any rea­son, for two weeks – and that those who did would not be al­lowed back dur­ing the quar­an­tine. So they ei­ther pre­pared to hun­ker down, or fled to their bed­rooms back home.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin is among a hand­ful of Amer­i­can uni­ver­si­ties driven by ris­ing in­fec­tions to try a dras­tic rem­edy: ask­ing large num­bers of stu­dents – some­times the en­tire cam­pus – to quar­an­tine for 14 days in their dor­mi­to­ries, apart­ments or fra­ter­nity and soror­ity houses.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can col­leges have be­come a ma­jor source of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>A New York Times track­ing ef­fort has iden­ti­fied more than 178,000 con­firmed cases at col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties since the pan­demic be­gan. Most have been an­nounced since stu­dents re­turned to cam­pus for the au­tumn term.</p>
    <p>As out­breaks have grown, cam­puswide quar­an­tines have been tried at in­sti­tu­tions large and small, from the sprawl­ing Univer­sity of Ari­zona in Tuc­son, which is­sued a two-week, shel­ter-in-place re­quest on Sept 15, to green-lawned Grand Val­ley State in western Michi­gan, where stu­dents were told to stay in their homes for 14 days start­ing on Sept 17.</p>
    <p>Some schools promised harsh penal­ties for vi­o­la­tors. Bradley Univer­sity in Peo­ria, Illi­nois, gave its stu­dents an easy way to re­port one an­other – the “snitch form” as it is known on cam­pus – and has is­sued US$250 (S$340) fines.</p>
    <p>But other col­leges have done lit­tle to keep stu­dents away from bars and late-night par­ties.</p>
    <p>Their quar­an­tine in­struc­tions al­lowed ex­cep­tions for a wide range of ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing classes, work, med­i­cal ap­point­ments, gro­cery shop­ping and take­outs.</p>
    <p>Still, on some cam­puses, the Hail Mary ap­pears to have worked: Caseloads there have come down.</p>
    <p>To find out what life is re­ally like at col­leges that tried to squelch so­cial­is­ing and slow the virus’ spread, we en­listed journalist­s from five schools to tell the story.</p>
    <p>‘We need ev­ery­one to do their part’</p>
    <p>Priya Jandu In Tuc­son, Ari­zona</p>
    <p>When some 45,000 stu­dents re­turned to the Univer­sity of Ari­zona in late Au­gust, of­fi­cials were clear that it was con­di­tional on com­pli­ance: We would have to wear masks in build­ings, fol­low so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments and use hand sani­tiser, which you can find ev­ery­where on cam­pus.</p>
    <p>Each week, our pres­i­dent, Mr Robert C. Rob­bins, gave a news con­fer­ence, im­plor­ing stu­dents to fol­low the rules.</p>
    <p>I am here to re­port: It did not work.</p>
    <p>Af­ter nearly 600 stu­dents tested pos­i­tive dur­ing the week of Sept 6, Mr Rob­bins an­nounced a “last­ditch ef­fort” to stem the out­break: a two-week, shel­ter-in-place rec­om­men­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“We need ev­ery­one to do their part,” he said.</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally, I did not go out much dur­ing the 14-day pe­riod. My busy work­load kept me holed up in my apart­ment, tak­ing on­line classes and work­ing on the cam­pus news­pa­per. But for oth­ers, life did not im­me­di­ately change.</p>
    <p>I live off Fourth Av­enue, a busy street filled with bars and restau­rants near the western edge of cam­pus. On the first weekend af­ter the shel­ter-in-place re­quest, it looked nor­mal – or at least as nor­mal as it can when peo­ple are out eat­ing and drink­ing dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Closer to cam­pus, Univer­sity Boule­vard was also open and run­ning. If an out-of-towner had walked past Gen­tle Ben’s Brew­ing or Il­le­gal Pete’s, two Univer­sity of Ari­zona in­sti­tu­tions, they would not have guessed ev­ery­one was sup­posed to be stay­ing home.</p>
    <p>Mr Rob­bins promised “dras­tic changes” would oc­cur if things did not im­prove, and they have. Over the past 10 days, the univer­sity has re­ported 42 new pos­i­tive tests, far be­low last month’s peak.</p>
    <p>I am hop­ing that means we will never have to find out what “dras­tic changes” he had in mind.</p>
    <p>‘Use the form’</p>
    <p>Ha­ley John­son In Peo­ria, Illi­nois</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially, the form on Bradley Univer­sity’s web­site that al­lows stu­dents to re­port vi­o­la­tions of the school’s coro­n­avirus rules is known as the non-com­pli­ance re­port.</p>
    <p>But we just call it the “snitch form”. You can re­port stu­dents for fail­ing to wear a mask, fail­ing to so­cial dis­tance, fail­ing to wash their hands for at least 20 sec­onds, and fail­ing to cough or sneeze into a tis­sue or el­bow.</p>
    <p>There is even an op­tion to up­load pho­to­graphic ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Rat­ting one an­other out be­came more tempt­ing as con­firmed cases be­gan ris­ing quickly at our school of 6,000 stu­dents in late Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The test pos­i­tiv­ity rate soared from less than 3 per cent on Aug 27 to more than 8 per cent a week later and 14 per cent by Sept 10, ac­cord­ing to the cam­pus dash­board.</p>
    <p>Given that steep climb, and the num­ber of stu­dents who were forced to quar­an­tine be­cause of con­tact trac­ing, the univer­sity or­dered a two-week, all-stu­dent quar­an­tine start­ing on Sept 8.</p>
    <p>“It is very im­por­tant stu­dents stay put,” of­fi­cials said. They were not kid­ding. Eight days into quar­an­tine, the univer­sity had is­sued 11 US$250 fines and was con­sid­er­ing whether to ban three stu­dents from cam­pus and sus­pend one for the rest of the aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>Mr Noah Mol­lett, 19, a sopho­more ma­jor­ing in theatre arts, said he ini­tially thought that “it’s their own grave they’re dig­ging” if stu­dents did not fol­low the rules.</p>
    <p>“But it spreads,” he noted. “When peo­ple break the rules, they’re hurt­ing other peo­ple and ru­in­ing other peo­ple’s ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter some­one on his floor tested pos­i­tive, he sought a test for him­self – also pos­i­tive – and was or­dered to iso­late for 10 days in a room with three other in­fected stu­dents. Af­ter his new room­mates in­vited sev­eral peo­ple into the apart­ment, he re­ported them.</p>
    <p>The cam­pus po­lice showed up, took the stu­dents’ names and made sure the guests left, he said. “My room­mates were less than happy,” Mr Mol­lett said. “I was wor­ried they would hurt me and my stuff.”</p>
    <p>The “snitch form” yields a lot of power, and there is po­ten­tial for abuse, even false re­ports.</p>
    <p>But com­bined with the quar­an­tine, there is ev­i­dence it might be work­ing. Bradley’s test pos­i­tiv­ity rate reached a peak of 16 per cent on Sept 17 but has since de­clined sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>“I can see why peo­ple are scared, but use the form,” Mr Mol­lett said.</p>
    <p>“It works.”</p>
    <p>Climb­ing caseloads on ‘the Hill’</p>
    <p>Anna Haynes In Boul­der, Colorado</p>
    <p>At the Univer­sity of Colorado, there is some­times an “us v them” mind­set pit­ting in­de­pen­dent stu­dents against those in fra­ter­ni­ties and soror­i­ties.</p>
    <p>That ten­sion has been high this term as Univer­sity Hill, known around town as “the Hill”, has be­come a hot spot in more ways than one. Home to bars and many of the school’s fra­ter­nity and soror­ity houses, it is the place you go to party, pan­demic or not.</p>
    <p>But it is also the place that helped to drive up the school’s coro­n­avirus caseloads, lead­ing Boul­der County on Sept 15 to is­sue a 14-day quar­an­tine no­tice for ev­ery Colorado stu­dent.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials blamed a ma­jor uptick in part on “large off-cam­pus gath­er­ings, par­tic­u­larly among soror­i­ties, fra­ter­ni­ties and other stu­dents liv­ing in the Hill neigh­bour­hood”.</p>
    <p>Things got even stricter on Sept 24, when the county pro­hib­ited any­one aged 18 to 22 from gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Al­though things have im­proved enough that some in-per­son classes have re­sumed and small gath­er­ings are now al­lowed, I do not know a sin­gle healthy per­son who re­mained in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“I drove past the Hill last night,” Ms De­laney Hart­mann, a 19-yearold sopho­more ma­jor­ing in po­lit­i­cal sci­ence, told me re­cently, “and there were tonnes of peo­ple at restau­rants, at the bars, not wear­ing masks”.</p>
    <p>She said she was es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to the coro­n­avirus, with con­di­tions – in­clud­ing dysau­tono­mia – that re­sult in chronic pain, fa­tigue and nau­sea.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to blame ev­ery sin­gle in­di­vid­ual who is liv­ing on the Hill who is in a soror­ity or fra­ter­nity,” she added. “But it is def­i­nitely a source of a lot of the out­breaks.”</p>
    <p>All of this has added to long-sim­mer­ing ten­sion be­tween Greek stu­dents and the rest of cam­pus.</p>
    <p>Some fra­ter­nity and soror­ity mem­bers “have taken a while to truly un­der­stand” the se­ri­ous­ness of Covid-19, Mr Harrison Bolin, pres­i­dent of the Xi chap­ter of the Chris­tian fra­ter­nity Al­pha Gamma Omega, ac­knowl­edged.</p>
    <p>But he said it was un­fair to blame Greek stu­dents alone. “The ad­min­is­tra­tion se­verely un­der­es­ti­mated their abil­ity to man­age tens of thou­sands of col­lege stu­dents go­ing through the long­est pe­riod of iso­la­tion and un­cer­tainty in our lives.”</p>
    <p>‘No­body is wear­ing a mask’</p>
    <p>Nick Mo­ran In Al­len­dale, Michi­gan</p>
    <p>Life has been very dif­fer­ent on the two cam­puses of Grand Val­ley State Univer­sity this au­tumn.</p>
    <p>Those of us who live in Al­len­dale, Michi­gan, home to about 14,500 stu­dents this se­mes­ter, spent two weeks un­der a stay-in-place or­der is­sued on Sept 16.</p>
    <p>It came af­ter the school re­ported one of the largest-known cam­pus out­breaks in Michi­gan, with more than 400 con­firmed cases.</p>
    <p>We were not sup­posed to leave home – ex­cept to go to work, at­tend classes or re­li­gious ser­vices, or ob­tain med­i­cal care, groceries or other ne­ces­si­ties. The or­der kept things a bit qui­eter than usual but many stu­dents seemed obliv­i­ous.</p>
    <p>“I think if they’re al­ready par­ty­ing, they’re not re­ally go­ing to stop,” said Ms Amelia Goet­zinger, 21, a ju­nior math­e­mat­ics ma­jor.</p>
    <p>Some 19km away, on the down­town Grand Rapids cam­pus i n neigh­bour­ing Kent County, some 7,700 stu­dents were un­af­fected by the or­der, al­though they are ex­pected to abide by the nor­mal pub­lic health re­stric­tions al­ready in place.</p>
    <p>To find out how things were dif­fer­ent on the down­town cam­pus, I spoke with Mr Michael Vazquez, 21, a se­nior his­tory ma­jor who lives in Grand Rapids.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple there, he said, ap­peared to be tak­ing the rules more se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>“In Kent County, you can’t go any­where or do any­thing without a mask,” he told me. But when he comes to Al­len­dale for his only in­per­son class, he noted: “No­body is wear­ing a mask other than me. It’s a lit­tle frus­trat­ing.”</p>
    <p>Through­out the two weeks that the or­der was in place, I did my best to com­ply. But at night, I could see and hear scat­tered groups of stu­dents mov­ing be­tween houses, with some still wan­der­ing the com­mu­nity mask­less.</p>
    <p>By fol­low­ing the rules, I missed the chance to cel­e­brate my room­mate’s birth­day with friends, and I missed see­ing my girl­friend. Two weeks? Felt like an eter­nity.</p>
    <p>‘Do I have enough to eat?’</p>
    <p>Ad­di­son Lathers In Madi­son, Wis­con­sin</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one seemed to know it was com­ing.</p>
    <p>It was only our sec­ond week of classes but coro­n­avirus caseloads at the Univer­sity of Wis­con­sinMadi­son were climb­ing quickly.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal of­fi­cials wanted ac­tion af­ter 46 sep­a­rate out­breaks and nearly 1,000 pos­i­tive cases. In a let­ter to ad­min­is­tra­tors on Sept 9, Mr Joe Parisi, the Dane County ex­ec­u­tive, called for stu­dents to be sent home. The cam­pus started to worry about a quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“I was go­ing into my very first col­lege exam,” said 18-year-old fresh­man Noah Cot­ton, who lived in a dor­mi­tory with a ma­jor out­break.</p>
    <p>In­stead of fo­cus­ing on his an­swers, he won­dered: “Do I have enough to eat? How am I go­ing to be able to talk to peo­ple?”</p>
    <p>That night, stu­dents be­gan to panic. Ev­ery­one bought groceries and al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>At 8.20pm, a univer­sity e-mail made it of­fi­cial: Two dor­mi­to­ries, Sellery and Witte, home to 2,200 stu­dents, would be quar­an­tined for two weeks start­ing at 10pm.</p>
    <p>“Res­i­dents of those halls will be re­quired to re­main in their hall dur­ing that time or go home,” the an­nounce­ment said. The univer­sity shifted classes on­line, and gath­er­ings of more than 10 peo­ple were pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>That’s when I saw the “SEND HELP” and “FREE US” sticky notes on the win­dows of Sellery and heard the mu­sic from The Purge boom­ing from an open win­dow.</p>
    <p>Mr Cot­ton would later test pos­i­tive. “It was def­i­nitely my floor,” he said. “My room­mate and I tested pos­i­tive. The peo­ple in the room next to us tested pos­i­tive. The peo­ple down the hall tested pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple chose to leave cam­pus that night. I watched stu­dents hop into Ubers, bound for ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Mr Cot­ton said he stayed be­cause he did not have much choice. “Most mi­nor­ity stu­dents don’t have the means to just leave the dorm, to travel, to get an apart­ment, to feel safe,” he said.</p>
    <p>The quar­an­tine seemed to do its job, and the lock­down has been lifted. “Due to the ac­tions the univer­sity took to con­tain a rise in cases early in the se­mes­ter, in­clud­ing ro­bust test­ing, iso­la­tion of pos­i­tive stu­dents, and quar­an­tines, Covid-19 cases have re­mained low on cam­pus since the third week of Septem­ber,” the univer­sity’s case­track­ing dash­board said last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one is hold­ing his breath to see how long it lasts.</p>
    <p>We just call it the “snitch form”. You can re­port stu­dents for fail­ing to wear a mask, fail­ing to so­cial dis­tance, fail­ing to wash their hands for at least 20 sec­onds, and fail­ing to cough or sneeze into a tis­sue or el­bow. There is even an op­tion to up­load pho­to­graphic ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Through­out the two weeks that the or­der was in place, I did my best to com­ply. But at night, I could see and hear scat­tered groups of stu­dents mov­ing be­tween houses, with some still wan­der­ing the com­mu­nity mask­less.</p>
