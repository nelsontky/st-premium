    <p>“Don’t put all your eggs in one bas­ket” may be a bit of an in­vest­ing cliche, but proper ap­pli­ca­tion is crit­i­cal to en­sure risks are spread out over a va­ri­ety of in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Back in the 2008 Lehman Broth­ers mini­bond cri­sis, Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias, en­coun­tered the case of a re­tiree who had put her en­tire re­tire­ment fund of $560,000 into the mini­bond.</p>
    <p>She was in­vited to a so­cial dance by a young re­la­tion­ship man­ager who told her on the dance floor that Lehman Broth­ers bank was six times big­ger than DBS Bank, and that she would get 6 per cent guar­an­teed re­turns.</p>
    <p>She was ex­cited be­cause her money in a fixed de­posit ac­count was earn­ing 0.55 per cent in­ter­est then. But af­ter six months, when Lehman Broth­ers went bank­rupt sud­denly, it ap­peared that her en­tire in­vest­ment was lost.</p>
    <p>She was dev­as­tated and ap­proached Sias in des­per­a­tion to get her money back from the bank, which sold her the mini­bond.</p>
    <p>We man­aged to re­cover for her, with the help of the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), the ma­jor­ity of her in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>She was some­what for­tu­nate be­cause there were thou­sands of oth­ers in her predica­ment.</p>
    <p>THE NEED FOR DI­VER­SI­FI­CA­TION</p>
    <p>Her anx­i­ety could have been avoided if she had di­ver­si­fied her port­fo­lio. For ex­am­ple, plac­ing her money in four or five dif­fer­ent in­vest­ments or as­set classes.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem was that she did not know any­thing about in­vest­ing. She heard of Sias only be­cause her friends di­rected her to us.</p>
    <p>My first ques­tion to her was why she had ploughed all her sav­ings into one in­vest­ment and whether she had ever at­tended any in­vestor ed­u­ca­tion class.</p>
    <p>She said she was a teacher her­self all her life and taught hun­dreds of chil­dren, but had not taught her­self how to in­vest.</p>
    <p>She could not be blamed be­cause fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy was not part of the school cur­ricu­lum un­til only re­cently.</p>
    <p>The sharp fall in stock prices around the world when the se­ri­ous­ness of the Covid-19 pan­demic was first ac­knowl­edged in March, and the swift bounce that en­sued has tempted many re­tail in­vestors to try their luck dab­bling in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>I have pre­vi­ously ex­plained the risks of short-term trad­ing and in­vest­ing with­out knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>The teacher’s ex­pe­ri­ence should be an eye-opener for those en­ter­ing the mar­ket blindly – it is es­sen­tial to stick to the tried and trusted prin­ci­ples of in­vest­ing rather than fol­low­ing oth­ers and punt­ing the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>UN­DER­STAND THE RISKS</p>
    <p>The first is to di­ver­sify. The sec­ond would be to un­der­stand that higher re­turns come with higher risks and the in­vest­ments that of­fer su­pe­rior re­turns will surely be ac­com­pa­nied by greater risks.</p>
    <p>In­vestors must know how much risk they can bear, oth­er­wise they may find them­selves buy­ing un­suit­able prod­ucts or stocks.</p>
    <p>You must know the prod­uct you are in­vest­ing in, its fea­tures and risks. In the case of Lehman mini­bonds, if even the fi­nan­cial pro­fes­sion­als had dif­fi­culty un­der­stand­ing the un­der­ly­ing risks, then how could the small in­vestors?</p>
    <p>Thanks to the MAS, in the af­ter­math of the mini­bond saga, is­suers now have to sum­marise all the risks and fea­tures in the prod­uct high­light sheet.</p>
    <p>Sias in­tro­duced the 10 ques­tions for in­vestors to ask their bank re­la­tion­ship man­agers, es­pe­cially if they are in­vest­ing in struc­tured prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>If you do not un­der­stand the in­vest­ment prod­uct, then do not in­vest. Just walk away!</p>
    <p>TIME HORI­ZON</p>
    <p>Younger in­vestors have a longer run­way ahead of them to work and, there­fore, ab­sorb in­vest­ment losses that might be suf­fered in the years ahead.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, this means they can take on more risk and, there­fore, in­vest more in stocks, but, as noted ear­lier, this re­ally de­pends on the in­di­vid­ual’s risk pro­file. In­vestors with a shorter run­way should ide­ally fo­cus on cap­i­tal preser­va­tion and in­vest in safer in­stru­ments such as bonds.</p>
    <p>THE LONG TERM</p>
    <p>AND HOLD­ING POWER</p>
    <p>Stud­ies of stock mar­kets over many decades have shown that given a lengthy time hori­zon, stocks will out­per­form bonds.</p>
    <p>The amount of out­per­for­mance will vary ac­cord­ing to the time­frame cho­sen, but re­search sug­gests 5 per cent to 8 per cent above the risk-free rate is pos­si­ble for hold­ing pe­ri­ods of more than 10 years.</p>
    <p>Our re­search has shown that the prob­a­bil­ity of suc­ceed­ing in an in­vest­ment is around 75 per cent at the 10-year mark.</p>
    <p>Much, of course, de­pends on in­di­vid­ual hold­ing power.</p>
    <p>In this con­nec­tion, should make sure they: have suf­fi­cient sav­ings in the form of an emer­gency fund of at least six times their monthly ex­penses; are prop­erly in­sured; and try as far as pos­si­ble to use only money that they can af­ford to lose when in­vest­ing in mar­kets. They should at all costs avoid bor­row­ing to in­vest.</p>
    <p>QUAL­ITY AND VAL­U­A­TIONS MAT­TER</p>
    <p>in­vestors</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hey­day of Clob In­ter­na­tional and dur­ing the dot.com boom and bust in the early 2000s, it be­came com­mon for in­vestors to ig­nore val­u­a­tions in favour of sup­pos­edly at­trac­tive fu­ture prospects.</p>
    <p>In other words, it didn’t mat­ter that Malaysian com­pa­nies on Clob or In­ter­net com­pa­nies whose prices were run­ning high had no earn­ings or fun­da­men­tals as long as they could spin a con­vinc­ing story about the po­ten­tial of su­pe­rior earn­ings in some dis­tant fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In the case of Clob, a pop­u­lar theme was in­fra­struc­ture, which fired the imag­i­na­tion of in­vestors be­cause of the large sums in­volved in build­ing dams, high­ways and bridges.</p>
    <p>For tech­nol­ogy firms, the In­ter­net was a new and novel de­vel­op­ment and in­vestors were sold on the idea of vast riches be­cause a com­pany’s mar­ket was no longer con­fined to its home, but in­stead would en­com­pass the whole world.</p>
    <p>In­vestors should be wary of this type of in­vest­ing, which is es­sen­tially pure spec­u­la­tion that might in some cases pro­duce good re­sults but comes with an in­or­di­nate amount of risk.</p>
    <p>In times of cri­sis such as now, it would be far more ad­vis­able to look for good-qual­ity com­pa­nies with strong bal­ance sheets and proven track records that would en­able them to stay afloat, in­stead of spec­u­lat­ing on ex­pec­ta­tions of vague prof­its in some un­known fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Scam­mers are aplenty nowa­days, with prom­ises of mind-bog­gling high re­turns.</p>
    <p>In­vestors should al­ways bear in mind that if it sounds too good to be true, it prob­a­bly is. Al­ways ask, check and con­firm be­fore fork­ing out your hard-earned money.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage is very clear, even if this time is dif­fer­ent in the sense that Covid-19 tran­scends any cri­sis ever seen in the past 100 years – the ap­proach to in­vest­ing should not be any dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Stick to the ba­sics to ride out this pe­riod – it should stand you in good stead.</p>
    <p>If you do not un­der­stand the in­vest­ment prod­uct, then do not in­vest.</p>
    <p>Just walk away!</p>
