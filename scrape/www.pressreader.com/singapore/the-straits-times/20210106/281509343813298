    <p>STAND­ING FIRM</p>
    <p>Mr Mah­mud Awang, one of the founders of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and its first care­taker pres­i­dent, died on Mon­day. He was 93.</p>
    <p>Mr Mah­mud, a for­mer Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) MP, was a prom­i­nent union­ist who laid the foun­da­tions for Sin­ga­pore’s prag­matic ap­proach to union is­sues and helped work­ers here im­prove their wages and work­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Born in Klu­ang, Jo­hor, in 1928, he moved here dur­ing World War II as one of many young men com­pelled by the Ja­panese oc­cu­py­ing forces to work at their naval school in Sem­bawang.</p>
    <p>He went back to Klu­ang af­ter the war but re­turned to Sin­ga­pore to find work. He then joined the Sin­ga­pore Trac­tion Com­pany (STC) as a bus con­duc­tor.</p>
    <p>In a con­do­lence let­ter yes­ter­day to Mr Mah­mud’s son En­dut, Prime</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said Mr Mah­mud was one of Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing lead­ers and a stal­wart in the fight against the com­mu­nists.</p>
    <p>Mr Mah­mud got in­volved in union work at STC, and be­came close friends with Mr Ah­mad Ibrahim, Mr De­van Nair and Mr Lee Kuan Yew dur­ing that time.</p>
    <p>He was elected pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Trac­tion Com­pany Em­ploy­ees’ Union, and later be­came pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Trades Union Congress (STUC).</p>
    <p>When the then MP for An­son, Mr Ba­harud­din Ariff, died in 1961, Mr Mah­mud was ap­proached by Mr Ah­mad, a Cab­i­net min­is­ter, to stand as a can­di­date in the by-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He agreed, and nar­rowly lost to for­mer chief min­is­ter David Mar­shall by about 500 votes af­ter six of the 10-mem­ber STUC sec­re­tariat is­sued a state­ment that called into question the PAP Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>That pre­cip­i­tated the split in the PAP, when 13 PAP as­sem­bly­men crossed the floor to form the Barisan Sosialis, PM Lee wrote in</p>
    <p>his let­ter.</p>
    <p>The STUC also split, with the pro-PAP unions – in­clud­ing the Sin­ga­pore Trac­tion Com­pany Em­ploy­ees’ Union – form­ing the NTUC.</p>
    <p>Mr Mah­mud be­came chair­man of the NTUC’s pro tem com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“He be­longed to the small group of union­ists who held the line against the left­ists, and even­tu­ally per­suaded work­ers to cast their lot with the PAP,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>In 1963, Mr Mah­mud again stood for elec­tion to the leg­isla­tive assem­bly in Kam­pong Ka­por, and won the seat for the PAP.</p>
    <p>He served as an MP for the next five years, step­ping down in 1968.</p>
    <p>In the two years when Sin­ga­pore was part of Malaysia, Mr Mah­mud was among the Malay PAP lead­ers who came un­der “fierce and re­lent­less pres­sure” by Umno politi­cians to choose race over na­tion, PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>“But En­cik Mah­mud and his com­rades em­braced the no­bler dream and held firm in their con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of their courage and</p>
    <p>lead­er­ship, the vi­sion of a mul­tira­cial Sin­ga­pore was kept alive, and is to­day a re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew was for­ever grate­ful for Mr Mah­mud’s stout­hearted sup­port at this crit­i­cal mo­ment in the Re­pub­lic’s history, and they kept in touch, PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>“We were hon­oured that En­cik Mah­mud was one of the pall­bear­ers at Mr Lee’s fu­neral in 2015.”</p>
    <p>In a let­ter sent to Mr Mah­mud’s family, NTUC pres­i­dent Mary Liew and sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng said the labour move­ment is sad­dened by his pass­ing.</p>
    <p>They noted that Mr Mah­mud was an early cham­pion of Sin­ga­pore’s unique tri­par­tism ap­proach, which has given the coun­try its com­pet­i­tive edge.</p>
    <p>“With­out pi­o­neer union lead­ers such as Brother Mah­mud, Sin­ga­pore would per­haps not be able to stand apart or even trans­form from Third World to First,” they said.</p>
    <p>He be­longed to the small group of union­ists who held the line against the left­ists, and even­tu­ally per­suaded work­ers to cast their lot with the PAP. ’’</p>
