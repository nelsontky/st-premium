    <p>IS­TAN­BUL Coro­n­avirus deaths in Tur­key have risen to a record for the seventh con­sec­u­tive day and the num­ber of new cases re­mains high de­spite ef­forts by Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan’s gov­ern­ment to con­tain a se­cond wave.</p>
    <p>Tur­key is ex­pected to re­port this week that its econ­omy bounced back from a sharp coro­n­avirus-in­duced slump ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>But that re­cov­ery, key to Mr Er­do­gan’s sus­tained political sup­port, could be threat­ened by the new out­break. The gov­ern­ment in­tro­duced tighter mea­sures a week ago, in­clud­ing nightly cur­fews on the week­ends, re­stric­tions on move­ments of peo­ple of non-work­ing age, a move to on­line school­ing and lim­it­ing restau­rants and cafes to take­away ser­vices.</p>
    <p>But th­ese have done lit­tle to halt a run­away rise in cases and deaths, with Sun­day’s toll of 185 dead 45 per cent above the peak of the first wave in April, and the num­ber of new cases be­hind only the United States, In­dia and Brazil – coun­tries with far larger pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>More than 29,000 cases were re­ported over a 24-hour pe­riod. Last Satur­day’s 30,103 was the high­est recorded, but the au­thor­i­ties have been in­clud­ing only asymp­to­matic cases since last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors and op­po­si­tion politi­cians have called for stricter mea­sures, but with shops, restau­rants and ho­tels al­ready hit by the new clam­p­down, the gov­ern­ment is anx­ious to avoid fur­ther eco­nomic pain and said peo­ple had a per­sonal duty to co­op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>“Our health army is un­der a heavy bur­den,” Health Min­is­ter Fahret­tin Koca said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“Each of us is re­spon­si­ble for fol­low­ing the mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Mr Er­do­gan at­trib­uted the resur­gent pan­demic to peo­ple flout­ing reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“Masks and (so­cial) dis­tanc­ing are very im­por­tant, hy­giene is very im­por­tant. As long as th­ese are not heeded, es­pe­cially in big cities, the in­creas­ing con­tin­u­a­tion of (the virus) be­comes in­evitable,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Op­po­nents say the gov­ern­ment needs to take tougher ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“The lives lost are our lives. But we see that the gov­ern­ment is still try­ing to man­age the sit­u­a­tion with band-aid mea­sures,” Ms Meral Ak­sener, leader of the op­po­si­tion IYI Party, said in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>An Is­tan­bul hos­pi­tal spe­cial­ist chest sur­geon Ce­lal­let­tin Koru­turk echoed the call for stricter mea­sures, say­ing that if the steps taken on the Nov 21 week­end were go­ing to be ef­fec­tive, they would have made a dif­fer­ence by now.</p>
    <p>“We need to act very dy­nam­i­cally with­out wait­ing fur­ther,” he said.</p>
