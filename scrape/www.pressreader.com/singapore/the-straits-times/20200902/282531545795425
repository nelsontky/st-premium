    <p>The science-fic­tion se­ries Raised By Wolves is the first tele­vi­sion show that Ri­d­ley Scott – the Os­car­win­ning film-maker who de­fined the genre with movies such as Alien (1979), Blade Run­ner (1982) and The Mar­tian (2015) – has di­rected in decades.</p>
    <p>And this is be­cause the show – which airs its first three episodes on HBO Go – tack­les all the juicy ideas the 82-year-old English di­rec­tor con­tin­ues to be fas­ci­nated by.</p>
    <p>The story cen­tres on two an­droids, named Mother (Amanda Collin) and Father (Abubakar Salim), who are given the dif­fi­cult task of rais­ing hu­man chil­dren on an in­hos­pitable planet.</p>
    <p>The am­bi­tious nar­ra­tive ex­plores not only the peren­nial ques­tion of how sen­tient such ro­bots are, but also a con­flict be­tween the athe­is­tic and re­li­gious fac­tions of hu­mans that threat­ens the new colony.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia via Zoom from his home in Lon­don re­cently, Scott says that, as al­ways, science fic­tion of­fers a way to com­ment on the world to­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bit like mak­ing his­tory films – we re­alise we don’t learn from past events and keep mak­ing the same mis­takes.</p>
    <p>“And in look­ing for­ward, science fic­tion is use­ful be­cause it’s like strik­ing a warn­ing bell.”</p>
    <p>Scott is asked what he thinks of the real ex­is­ten­tial threat posed to mankind by ad­vanced ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) – some­thing many roboti­cists and philoso­phers have warned of, and which his films have pre­sciently ex­plored.</p>
    <p>“When you get the first su­per­com­puter, it will prob­a­bly be a kind of box, maybe this big. But that su­per­com­puter will then de­sign a com­puter even smarter than it is,” he says.</p>
    <p>“And from that mo­ment in time is when we’re in real trou­ble – be­cause they’ll al­ready have worked out how stupid we are.”</p>
    <p>Scott and Raised By Wolves’ creator, Aaron Guzikowski (Pris­on­ers, 2013), also strove to dis­tin­guish the se­ries from other sci-fi films and shows, which Scott be­lieves have be­come repet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The genre to­day “is much in need of some­thing fresh”, says the film­maker, who picked up Best Di­rec­tor Os­car nom­i­na­tions for the dra­mas Thelma & Louise (1991), Gla­di­a­tor (2000) and Black Hawk Down (2001), be­fore even­tu­ally win­ning for The Mar­tian.</p>
    <p>“When some­thing good hap­pens, there seems to be a gen­er­a­tion of copy­cats and that neu­tralises what was re­ally good.</p>
    <p>“So one is in con­stant search of how to make this orig­i­nal,” he adds. “The prob­lem is I’ve done a few science-fic­tion movies and you try not to re­peat your­self.”</p>
    <p>With the themes ex­am­ined on the show, it was “very easy to be corny”, Scott ad­mits. “But I fol­low my in­tu­ition, be­cause in­tu­ition is usu­ally based on ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>That and his art-school back­ground took him in some un­ex­pected di­rec­tions when it came to fash­ion­ing the look of the show.</p>
    <p>For the space­ship, for in­stance, he drew on the fu­tur­is­tic shape of his elec­tric ra­zor; and for the an­droids, he looked to singer David Bowie and a ran­dom sight­ing in a racy lin­gerie shop.</p>
    <p>His art and de­sign back­ground al­ways in­forms his work as a di­rec­tor, Scott says.</p>
    <p>“School, for me, was a very bad idea. I passed one out of 10 sub­jects for my GCEs (Gen­eral Cer­tifi­cate of Ed­u­ca­tion), so I was crit­i­cally stupid.</p>
    <p>“But I was very good at one thing, which was art, and I spent seven years at art school, which, hon­estly, I owe my en­tire film ca­reer to. What I learnt at art school, I still use every day when I’m mak­ing a movie.”</p>
    <p>For the an­droid Mother, he was in­spired by pop icon David Bowie and the fu­tur­is­tic al­ter ego he adopted for his 1972 Ziggy Star­dust al­bum.</p>
    <p>“That’s how we ended up with Mother’s hair­cut. Then I felt Father should be as hand­some as (the late ac­tor) Harry Be­la­fonte, and so Abu was cast.”</p>
    <p>He orig­i­nally thought Mother and Father should be naked as well – “be­cause they are like Adam and Eve, re­ally”.</p>
    <p>“But that might be a bridge too far for HBO, who might have a heart at­tack,” he says, smil­ing.</p>
    <p>“And so – this is a funny story, but it’s true – I was walk­ing in Soho near my of­fice in Lon­don and in the win­dow of a fancy lin­gerie shop, I saw a skintight elas­tic body­suit.”</p>
    <p>He got the cos­tume de­signer to recre­ate it for the an­droids, “and I went for the elas­tic­ity be­cause it be­came a metaphor for naked­ness”, Scott says.</p>
    <p>“I think ev­ery­one was a lit­tle wor­ried about it ini­tially, but all I can do is go along with my in­tu­ition. And I think the way they look is spec­tac­u­lar.”</p>
