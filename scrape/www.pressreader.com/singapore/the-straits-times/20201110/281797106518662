    <p>United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is per­haps most fondly re­mem­bered by Sin­ga­pore­ans for his sur­prise pit stop at Adam Road hawker cen­tre while on his first of­fi­cial visit to the Repub­lic as vice-pres­i­dent in 2013.</p>
    <p>At the hawker cen­tre, he and his son-in-law Howard Krein drank $3 lime juice, posed for pho­to­graphs and stopped to chat with din­ers.</p>
    <p>The two-day visit also saw back-to-back en­gage­ments for Mr Bi­den, which in­cluded a meet­ing with Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong at the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>As vice-pres­i­dent dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, Mr Bi­den forged ties and links with Sin­ga­pore, and PM Lee, in a con­grat­u­la­tory let­ter to the pres­i­dent-elect on Sun­day, said that he hoped to meet him again.</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that dur­ing Mr Bi­den’s ten­ure as vice-pres­i­dent, sig­nif­i­cant strides were made in re­la­tions be­tween the US and the</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, in­clud­ing the US’ en­try to the East Asia Sum­mit and the ap­point­ment of its first am­bas­sador to Asean.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also re­ferred to the US’ “long­stand­ing, multi-faceted and ro­bust part­ner­ship” with Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing in the eco­nomic and de­fence spheres as well as in many other new ar­eas, in­clud­ing in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment and cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“I look for­ward to work­ing with you to deepen the part­ner­ship be­tween our two coun­tries and en­hance the United States’ pres­ence in the Asia-Pa­cific. You can con­tinue to count on Sin­ga­pore as a friend and part­ner,” said PM Lee in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his visit, Mr Bi­den also called on then Pres­i­dent Tony Tan Keng Yam and met found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew whom the then US vice-pres­i­dent de­scribed as “one of the most ad­mired men in the world”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den of­ten spoke about his meet­ings with Mr Lee in pub­lic speeches and, af­ter the lat­ter’s pass­ing, penned a page-long con­do­lence mes­sage say­ing that few world lead­ers pos­sessed Mr Lee’s in­sight and wis­dom on world af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s wife Jill and daugh­ter Ash­ley, who is mar­ried to Mr Krein, ac­com­pa­nied the vi­cepres­i­dent on his visit to Sin­ga­pore. He and his wife had a deep pur­ple orchid hy­brid – the Den­dro­bium Joe and Jill Bi­den – named af­ter them when they vis­ited the National Orchid Gar­den at the Botanic Gar­dens.</p>
    <p>“Never did I think in my wildest dreams that I would have an orchid named af­ter me and my wife. That is be­yond any ex­pec­ta­tions I ever had as a child or as an adult,” said Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>His wife, a for­mer high school teacher and now a col­lege pro­fes­sor, and his daugh­ter also vis­ited the National Li­brary where they read to a group of pri­mary school pupils. Mr Bi­den con­cluded the trip with a visit to US air­craft en­gine maker Pratt & Whit­ney and the USS Free­dom, a lit­toral com­bat ship de­ployed at Changi Naval Base.</p>
