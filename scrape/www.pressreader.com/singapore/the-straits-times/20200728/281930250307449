    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s com­pe­ti­tion reg­u­la­tor yes­ter­day ac­cused Al­pha­bet’s Google of mis­lead­ing con­sumers to get per­mis­sion for use of their per­sonal data in tar­geted ad­ver­tis­ing, seek­ing a fine “in the mil­lions” and aim­ing to es­tab­lish a prece­dent.</p>
    <p>The move comes as scru­tiny grows world­wide over data pri­vacy, with US and Euro­pean law­mak­ers re­cently fo­cus­ing on how tech com­pa­nies treat user data.</p>
    <p>In court doc­u­ments, the Aus­tralian Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion ac­cused US tech gi­ant Google of not ex­plic­itly get­ting con­sent from or prop­erly in­form­ing con­sumers of a 2016 move to com­bine per­sonal in­for­ma­tion in Google ac­counts with brows­ing ac­tiv­i­ties on non-Google web­sites.</p>
    <p>“This change... was worth a lot of money to Google,” said com­mis­sion chair­man Rod Sims. “We al­lege they’ve achieved it through mis­lead­ing be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>The change al­lowed Google to link the brows­ing be­hav­iour of mil­lions of con­sumers with their names and iden­ti­ties, pro­vid­ing it with ex­treme mar­ket power, the reg­u­la­tor added.</p>
    <p>“We con­sider Google mis­led Aus­tralian con­sumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing In­ter­net ac­tiv­ity on web­sites not connected to Google,” Mr Sims said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Google said the change was op­tional and that con­sumer con­sent was sought through prom­i­nent and easy-to-un­der­stand no­ti­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“If a user did not con­sent, their ex­pe­ri­ence of our prod­ucts and ser­vices re­mained un­changed,” said a Google spokesman in an e-mail, adding that the com­pany in­tends to de­fend its po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In June 2016, Google changed the word­ing of its pri­vacy pol­icy, drop­ping a state­ment that it would not com­bine data known as “cook­ies” from its ad­ver­tise­ment dis­play busi­ness, Dou­bleClick, with users’ per­sonal in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the new pol­icy read: “De­pend­ing on your ac­count set­tings, your ac­tiv­ity on other sites and apps may be as­so­ci­ated with your per­sonal in­for­ma­tion in or­der to im­prove Google ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian reg­u­la­tor al­leges that Google used the com­bined data to boost tar­geted ad­ver­tis­ing – a key in­come source – and that it did not make clear to con­sumers the changes in its pri­vacy pol­icy. “This is an ac­tion we are tak­ing that oth­ers have not,” said Mr Sims.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor, through its ac­tion in Aus­tralia’s fed­eral court, also wanted to es­tab­lish the com­mon law on what providers in var­i­ous ju­ris­dic­tions could do, and was po­ten­tially seek­ing “mil­lions” in dam­ages, he added, with­out spec­i­fy­ing a fig­ure.</p>
    <p>“We will keep tak­ing ac­tion, as will agen­cies over­seas, and it will shape how these plat­forms be­have, to make sure that the In­ter­net is a ben­e­fit to users, not a detri­ment.”</p>
