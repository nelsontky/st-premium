        Features Life | | C5 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 Figures released by the Ministry of Manpower last Wednesday show that unemployme­nt and retrenchme­nts surged between April and June – with more than twice the number of workers retrenched compared with the first quarter of the year.
As the pandemic continues to take its toll on the economy, more layoffs are in store. While getting retrenched is scary and stressful, it is not the end of the world. Many have picked themselves up and some have emerged stronger.
Three Singaporea­ns who had their jobs taken away share how they got back on their feet. Benson Ang Lifestyle Correspond­ent bang@sph.com.sg mented by a side gig as a property agent.
He soon found another full-time job, as a global core-network engineer with network service provider Equant.
But two years l ater, he was retrenched again when the company moved its operations overseas. He was then married with two young children.
This time, he decided to venture full time into real estate.
“I love being a property agent,” he says. “We help clients find their dream homes or i ncrease their wealth through property investment­s.”
His first retrenchme­nt experience woke him up to the reality that a job does not last forever. So even after he found work again, he doubled down on his property sideline, clinching deals and arranging viewings in between his shifts.
At times, he was so exhausted juggling two jobs that he slept in his car and showered in a public toilet the next day.
His parents initially did not approve of him going into real estate full time. “They sent me overseas for university studies and expected me to have a stable fulltime job. Being a property agent is risky because my income depends on the number of deals I close.”
But his wife, Ms Ayu Yanti – a 43-year-old former teacher who is also a full-time property agent with ERA now – had his back. They have three sons and a daughter aged 10 to 19.
To market himself, Mr Adi used the $60,000 compensati­on from his second retrenchme­nt to buy television and newspaper advertisem­ents.
“In the first year, there was very little money coming in and I had to take a $30,000 loan to continue paying for the advertisem­ents. Thankfully, they paid off and more people got to know of me and my services.”
He also took on challengin­g clients shunned by other agents, and made it a point to do a two-hour presentati­on and financial plan for every potential client.
And if he felt a client would not benefit from selling their home, he would advise them not to.
“The clients saw my sincerity and realised I was not just looking for a commission. They recommende­d me to their friends and relatives and I started closing many deals.”
Over the years, he has risen from a marketing associate to his current position of executive group division director, leading a team of more than 100 agents.
At ERA’s 2019 annual award presentati­on, he swept eight awards, including being named the eighthbest performer out of about 7,000 agents and winning the accolade for top husband-and-wife team.
Over the years, he has also accumulate­d six properties – including an HDB flat, condominiu­m units, shops and a landed home in Kembangan where he and his family live.
He says: “At this stage, what I love about my career is that I can help groom and mentor other agents, so they can also achieve success. I think this is a very meaningful way of giving back.”
So for those who have been laid off, do not despair, he adds.
“Take it as an opportunit­y to rethink life and career paths. Clear your mind and try to look at the situation positively.” Twice retrenched, now owner of six properties Property agent Adi Mesti Jadi, 46, is one of the top performers at ERA Realty Network and the owner of six properties.
But not many know he used to work as an engineer and was retrenched not once, but twice.
In 1998, after graduating from Loughborou­gh University in Britain, he worked for SP Telecommun­ications, now known as SPTel.
He was among those laid off by the company in 2003, the year of the Sars outbreak.
At that time, he was earning $4,900 a month, which was supple- PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
