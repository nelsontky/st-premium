    <p>A top ar­bi­tra­tor in N. and S. Amer­ica</p>
    <p>Build­ing a ca­reer in law in­stead of gov­ern­ment ser­vice was one of the harder de­ci­sions he had to make decades ago, said New York-based Sin­ga­porean Cheng Tai-Heng, an Ox­ford-trained for­mer Pres­i­dent’s Scholar.</p>
    <p>To­day, Dr Cheng, 43, is global co-head of in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion and trade at Si­d­ley Austin LLP, a first-tier Amer­i­can global law firm – the same firm where for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama met his wife Michelle in 1989 when they were work­ing at its Chicago of­fice.</p>
    <p>“I envy my friends (in Sin­ga­pore) who per­form pol­i­cy­mak­ing or po­lit­i­cal roles, be­cause the prob­lems they con­front are unique and chal­leng­ing, and their de­ci­sions di­rectly ben­e­fit many peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, as part of Sin­ga­pore’s ex­ter­nal net­work, I am able to help Sin­ga­pore busi</p>
    <p>nesses and de­ci­sion-mak­ers by draw­ing on over two decades of ex­pe­ri­ence han­dling chal­leng­ing le­gal and geopo­lit­i­cal prob­lems for cor­po­ra­tions and gov­ern­ments,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheng, who is also a prize-win­ning Brazil­ian ju­jitsu ex­po­nent, is one of a grow­ing num­ber of Sin­ga­porean lawyers hold­ing lead­er­ship po­si­tions abroad. Oth­ers in­clude World In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Or­gan­i­sa­tion direc­tor-gen­eral Daren Tang and global law firm Baker & McKen­zie’s global chair Mil­ton W. M. Cheng .</p>
    <p>“Al­though Sin­ga­pore is now a ma­jor cen­tre of in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion, when I was a fledg­ling lawyer over two decades ago, this area of spe­cial­i­sa­tion was not de­vel­oped in the Sin­ga­pore law firms. The deep le­gal mar­kets were the US, Eng­land and France. I had to move overseas to learn and grow as a lawyer in my field,” said Dr Cheng.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges in start­ing out in New York made him “more driven, adapt­able and em­pa­thetic”.</p>
    <p>“When you start at the bot­tom, you un­der­stand bet­ter the dif­fi­cul­ties that peo­ple ev­ery­where face in try­ing to get through life, care for their fam­i­lies, and build up their com­mu­ni­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>There were few Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing at global law firms in New York and Lon­don 20 years ago but the group is grow­ing and he ex­pects more Sin­ga­pore­ans in global lead­er­ship po­si­tions in a decade.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has al­ways punched above its weight in diplo­macy. It is now do­ing so in law as well,” said Dr Cheng, whose cre­den­tials in­clude be­ing a pro­fes­sor of law at New York Law School.</p>

    <p>DR CHENG TAI-HENG, global co-head of in­ter­na­tional ar­bi­tra­tion and trade at Si­d­ley Austin LLP.</p>
    <p>Be­sides win­ning nine-fig­ure awards for clients, he is also an ad­viser on is­sues be­yond busi­ness dis­putes. He is ranked as one of the</p>
    <p>top 10 ar­bi­tra­tion prac­ti­tion­ers in North and South Amer­ica un­der 45 by Who’s Who Le­gal.</p>
    <p>“I am for­tu­nate to have clients who trusted me with their sub­stan­tial dis­putes, and have won many of them, like se­cur­ing a US$620 mil­lion (S$815 mil­lion) ar­bi­tra­tion award for (off­shore drilling com­pany) Van­tage against Petro­bras, Brazil’s state owned oil com­pany.</p>
    <p>“I am also pre­sid­ing ar­bi­tra­tor in an investor-state ar­bi­tra­tion brought by a UK investor against China. To­gether with Si­d­ley’s Sin­ga­pore team and a New York­based Sin­ga­porean lawyer at my firm, Meera Ra­jah, we are in­volved in a pub­lic in­ter­na­tional law dis­pute case be­fore the African Court of Jus­tice and Hu­man Rights.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore lawyers to develop deep ex­per­tise in pub­lic in­ter­na­tional law, fol­low­ing in the tra­di­tion of em­i­nent ju­rists like Prof S. Jayaku­mar and Prof Tommy Koh. All of these cases are a team ef­fort.”</p>
