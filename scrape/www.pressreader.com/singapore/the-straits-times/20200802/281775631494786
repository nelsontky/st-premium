    <p>The mo­bile col­umn, a drive-past of mil­i­tary ve­hi­cles and as­sets, will be scaled down for this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP), with 66 as­sets from the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF), Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) and Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) on dis­play.</p>
    <p>There will be 22 dif­fer­ent types of equip­ment rum­bling through five routes as the mo­bile col­umn makes its way into the heart­land for the sec­ond year in a row. These in­clude the crowd favourite Leop­ard 2SG main bat­tle tank and the SPF’s new, next-gen­er­a­tion fast re­sponse car. The mo­bile col­umn in last year’s NDP fea­tured 79 types of equip­ment and a total of 171 as­sets.</p>
    <p>Each of the five routes for this year – in the north, south, west, north-east and south-east ar­eas of Sin­ga­pore – will fea­ture 13 or 14 as­sets and 60 to 70 par­tic­i­pants, in­clud­ing the mo­bile col­umn crew. About 100 front-line work­ers bat­tling the pan­demic and es­sen­tial work­ers will also be aboard the ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The routes will cover a total dis­tance of about 200km, the long­est dis­tance cov­ered by a mo­bile col­umn in the heart­land to date. Last year’s routes to­talled 133km, and the pre­vi­ous one in 2010 to­talled 80km.</p>
    <p>“The NDP mo­bile col­umn is a dis­play of our na­tion’s strength and unity. It is a peren­nial Sin­ga­porean favourite,” said Lieu­tenant-Colonel Low Youwen, chair­man of the mo­bile col­umn com­mit­tee, at a me­dia brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The mo­bile col­umn will also sa­lute health­care work­ers as it trav­els past sev­eral key lo­ca­tions. These in­clude Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal, Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and the com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­ity at Sin­ga­pore Expo.</p>
    <p>One par­tic­i­pant in the mo­bile col­umn this year is Cap­tain Eastina Tan, 29, who is the for­ma­tion li­ai­son of­fi­cer for the Ter­rex in­fantry car­rier plat­form.</p>
    <p>The SAF reg­u­lar said the drive-past and sa­lute will pay trib­ute to the per­se­ver­ance and ded­i­ca­tion of front-line work­ers dur­ing the pan­demic – something es­pe­cially mean­ing­ful for her as her mother is a nurse with the Methodist Wel­fare So­ci­ety who looked after pa­tients dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Another par­tic­i­pant is Cap­tain Syafiq Mohd Ab­dul Muhaimin Ong, 25, an SCDF reg­u­lar who has been de­ployed to the com­mand centre of a gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity. He will be a ve­hi­cle com­man­der for one of the SCDF’s fifth-gen­er­a­tion Pump Lad­der fire en­gines in the mo­bile col­umn.</p>
    <p>“This NDP is not just a trib­ute to our front-line fight­ers, but also a cel­e­bra­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans’ re­silience, adapt­abil­ity and com­pas­sion,” said Capt Syafiq.</p>
    <p>Sta­tion In­spec­tor Jacky Kwan, 38, will be a ve­hi­cle com­man­der for the only as­set to make its NDP de­but this year, the SPF’s next-gen­er­a­tion fast re­sponse car.</p>
    <p>The new po­lice dis­patch ve­hi­cle is be­ing rolled out pro­gres­sively, with new sys­tems and fea­tures to help ground re­sponse of­fi­cers like him re­spond quickly to 999 calls. Sta­tion Insp Kwan will drive past his own neigh­bour­hood in Wham­poa on his des­ig­nated route. His son and daugh­ter, aged seven and five re­spec­tively, are look­ing for­ward to cheer­ing him on, he said.</p>
    <p>The mo­bile col­umn will travel through Sin­ga­pore from 10am to 1pm on Na­tional Day, after the morn­ing pa­rade at the Padang. It will be broad­cast live on freeto-air TV chan­nels and the NDPeeps YouTube chan­nel.</p>
