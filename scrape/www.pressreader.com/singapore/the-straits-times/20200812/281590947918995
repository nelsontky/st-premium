    <p>Ja­panese swim star Rikako Ikee is penned in for a lo­cal com­pe­ti­tion at the month end af­ter just five months of train­ing fol­low­ing her bat­tle with leukaemia. This has sparked spec­u­la­tion that the 20-year-old, who was tar­get­ing the 2024 Paris Olympics, may try to qual­ify for her post­poned home Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese swim­ming star Rikako Ikee has reg­is­tered for a com­pe­ti­tion in Tokyo this month, her first since her shock leukaemia di­ag­no­sis last year, the lo­cal me­dia re­ported yes­ter­day .</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old was a strong favourite for 100m but­ter­fly gold at the Tokyo 2020 Games be­fore re­veal­ing last year that she had blood cancer in Fe­bru­ary of last year.</p>
    <p>She was dis­charged last De­cem­ber af­ter be­ing hos­pi­talised for about 10 months and re­sumed train­ing in March.</p>
    <p>Public broad­caster NHK and Ky­odo News yes­ter­day said she had signed up for a 50m freestyle race or­gan­ised by the Tokyo Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion on Aug 29.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the as­so­ci­a­tion de­clined to com­ment, say­ing only that reg­is­tra­tion for the event was still open.</p>
    <p>Ikee has doc­u­mented her fight against the disease on­line, thank­ing her fans for their sup­port.</p>
    <p>“It was a long and hard time,” she said last year in a hand­writ­ten mes­sage posted on her Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>Ikee was also con­sid­ered a con­tender for the Tokyo 2020 200m free, but her di­ag­no­sis forced her to switch her fo­cus to com­pet­ing in the Paris 2024 Games.</p>
    <p>She has not said if she plans to re­think and com­pete in Tokyo next year, fol­low­ing the post­pone­ment of the Olympics un­til next July be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ikee served as the key fig­ure at a sub­dued year-to-go cer­e­mony for the de­layed Games last month, urg­ing dis­heart­ened ath­letes not to lose faith.</p>
    <p>“Think of the com­ing year not sim­ply as a one-year post­pone­ment, but a plus-one,” she said. “To over­come ad­ver­sity, what we need is hope, a flame of hope of glow­ing in the dis­tance al­lows us to keep try­ing, to keep mov­ing for­ward, no mat­ter how hard it is.”</p>
    <p>Ikee, who be­came the first swim­mer to win six gold medals at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and Palem­bang, has not swam com­pet­i­tively since Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Ja­pan Times, she plans to ramp up her prepa­ra­tions af­ter the Aug 29 race, with an eye on the Ja­panese in­ter-col­le­giate cham­pi­onships in early Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Last month, Amer­i­can ri­val and five-time Olympic swim­ming gold medal­list Katie Ledecky told Ky­odo News that Ikee’s bat­tle against cancer was an in­spi­ra­tion to her.</p>
    <p>Re­veal­ing that they had kept in touch through In­sta­gram, the 23-year-old said: “It was so hard to see her go through this over the past year... I can’t wait to see what she can ac­com­plish in the pool in the years to come.”</p>
