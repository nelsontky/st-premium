    <p>United Over­seas Bank ( UOB) posted a 40 per cent drop in thirdquar­ter net profit to $668 mil­lion, from $1.12 bil­lion a year ear­lier, as it built up on al­lowances for po­ten­tial bad loans amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings were bet­ter than ex­pected, top­ping the $641 mil­lion av­er­age fore­cast by an­a­lysts in a Bloomberg poll.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional $339 mil­lion in credit al­lowance for non-im­paired as­sets was set aside to strengthen pro­vi­sion cov­er­age, bring­ing to­tal credit costs on loans to 68 ba­sis points (bps) in the third quar­ter, from 23bps a year ago, the bank said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>UOB is the first of Sin­ga­pore’s lo­cal banks to re­port re­sults for the third quar­ter. DBS Bank and OCBC Bank are set to post their earn­ings to­day.</p>
    <p>UOB’s an­nu­alised earn­ings per share was $1.55 for the quar­ter, a de­crease from $2.62 a year ago.</p>
    <p>Its non-per­form­ing loans (NPL) ra­tio im­proved quar­ter on quar­ter to 1.5 per cent from 1.6 per cent, as NPL for­ma­tion stayed low cou­pled with more re­cov­er­ies in the quar­ter, said UOB.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing profit rose 3 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter to $1.25 bil­lion on im­proved mar­gins and higher fees as eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity grad­u­ally re­sumed.</p>
    <p>Net in­ter­est in­come de­creased 13 per cent year on year to $1.47 bil­lion as ef­fects from mar­gin com­pres­sion off­set loan growth of 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Non-in­ter­est in­come fell 15 per cent to $786 mil­lion as busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties across cor­po­rate and re­tail cus­tomers de­clined. Trad­ing and in­vest­ment in­come de­clined 32 per cent to $210 mil­lion, largely due to lower net trad­ing in­come.</p>
    <p>To­tal op­er­at­ing ex­penses de­creased 13 per cent to $1.01 bil­lion on cost man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>UOB chief Wee Ee Cheong said the bank’s as­set qual­ity is man­age­able and it is ad­e­quately pro­vi­sioned even with the ex­piry of mora­to­rium pro­grammes across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“While there are early signs of re­cov­ery across the global economy, the tra­jec­tory re­mains un­even and un­clear. Given the evolv­ing geopo­lit­i­cal and pan­demic sit­u­a­tion, we re­main vig­i­lant, es­pe­cially in our key re­gional mar­kets,” he said.</p>
    <p>UOB’s net profit for the first nine months fell 33 per cent year on year to $2.23 bil­lion. This was due to de­clin­ing mar­gins, slower cus­tomer ac­tiv­i­ties and pre-emp­tive credit pro­vi­sion­ing in the light of pan­demic un­cer­tain­ties.</p>
    <p>For the nine months, the group’s re­tail busi­ness recorded a 5 per cent fall in op­er­at­ing profit to $1.57 bil­lion, on the back of lower in­ter­est rates. It was partly mod­er­ated by de­posit growth and higher wealth in­come and ex­pense man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing profit from its whole­sale bank­ing busi­ness climbed 1 per cent to $2.37 bil­lion, sup­ported by loans, trade and trea­sury prod­ucts which off­set the im­pact of com­pressed mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Its global mar­kets busi­ness posted a 69 per cent surge in op­er­at­ing profit to $428 mil­lion, buoyed by stronger trad­ing per­for­mance and gain from sale of in­vest­ment se­cu­ri­ties, as well as higher rev­enue from fund­ing and liq­uid­ity man­age­ment on the back of a sharp de­crease in in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee added that the Covid-19 pan­demic has pre­sented an op­por­tu­nity for UOB to ac­cel­er­ate its omni-chan­nel ap­proach and open new cus­tomer ser­vice mod­els.</p>
    <p>Its mo­bile bank­ing app UOB Mighty and dig­i­tal bank TMRW have seen a rise in en­gage­ment and trans­ac­tions, and it re­cently launched the UOB In­fin­ity ser­vice for cor­po­rate cus­tomers, he noted.</p>
    <p>He em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of up­skilling, im­prov­ing staff pro­duc­tiv­ity and adopt­ing a flex­i­ble ap­proach to work in the con­stantly chang­ing op­er­at­ing land­scape.</p>
    <p>UOB shares closed at $19.80 yes­ter­day, up 35 cents, or 1.8 per cent.</p>
