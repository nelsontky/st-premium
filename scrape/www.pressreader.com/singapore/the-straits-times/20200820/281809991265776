    <p>SEOUL • South Korea yes­ter­day re­ported its high­est daily rise in novel coro­n­avirus cases since early March as out­breaks from churches around the cap­i­tal spread, prompt­ing a warn­ing of a na­tion­wide wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The 297 new in­fec­tions mark the sixth straight day of triple-digit in­creases in a coun­try that has man­aged to blunt sev­eral pre­vi­ous out­breaks.</p>
    <p>The na­tional tally rose to 16,058 in­fec­tions with 306 deaths, ac­cord­ing to data from the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion.</p>
    <p>Nearly 90 per cent of the new cases ap­peared in the cap­i­tal, Seoul, and sur­round­ing ar­eas, rais­ing con­cern of the rapid spread of the virus in a metropoli­tan area of more than 25 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“We’re in a des­per­ately dan­ger­ous cri­sis where in­fec­tions are spread­ing in the Seoul metropoli­tan area and threat­en­ing to lead to a mas­sive na­tion­wide trans­mis­sion,” Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kim Gang-lip told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment can­not con­tain the cur­rent spread with only trac­ing and iso­la­tion... please stay home un­less you must go out.”</p>
    <p>At least 166 of the new in­fec­tions are linked to the Sarang Jeil Church, tak­ing the num­ber of cases from it to 623.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have mo­bilised some 8,500 po­lice of­fi­cers to trace an­other 600 mem­bers of the church’s con­gre­ga­tion who should be in iso­la­tion, and they are try­ing to test all of its 4,000 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Some mem­bers of the church, which is run by a rad­i­cal con­ser­va­tive preacher, are re­luc­tant to come for­ward and get tested, or to self­iso­late, of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>Many of them also at­tended antigov­ern­ment ral­lies in Seoul on the week­end where thou­sands of peo­ple gath­ered from across the coun­try, rais­ing fears that in­fec­tions were seeded there.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion’s deputy di­rec­tor Kwon Jun-wook said 10 peo­ple at the protests with no ties to the church had been in­fected and urged every­one who at­tended to get tested.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun vowed to take le­gal ac­tion against the church for any at­tempt to dis­rupt trac­ing and test­ing ef­forts by fail­ing to pro­vide ac­cu­rate mem­ber­ship lists.</p>
    <p>At least three other smaller clus­ters have been traced to churches in Seoul and one to a church in the city of Yon­gin.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more than 50 cases have been linked to a cof­fee out­let in the city of Paju. Night­clubs, karaoke bars, buf­fets and cy­ber cafes have been or­dered to close in Seoul and sur­round­ing re­gions.</p>
    <p>In-per­son church ser­vices have been banned while in­door and out­door gath­er­ings have been re­stricted to no more than 50 and 100 peo­ple, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said that if the num­ber of in­fec­tions rises or con­tin­ues at the cur­rent rate of spread, they will likely im­pose the high­est level of so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, un­der which schools are closed, busi­nesses and peo­ple ad­vised to work from home, and gath­er­ings lim­ited to 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion’s Mr Kwon said the coun­try would be at a “cross­roads” for the next few days and the govern­ment might have to im­pose tougher curbs if there was a spike in cases with no ob­vi­ous ori­gin.</p>
