    <p>Poll­sters in In­done­sia have been unerring since di­rect pres­i­den­tial elec­tions were in­tro­duced in 2004. But this un­blem­ished track record – largely due to sur­vey meth­ods and con­sis­tent voter be­hav­iour – will be sorely tested at the up­com­ing re­gional elec­tions be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The polling firms’ most re­cent suc­cess was at the 2019 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion when they gave in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo a lead of 10-20 per­cent­age points over ri­val Prabowo Su­bianto. Mr Joko even­tu­ally won re-elec­tion with 55 per cent of the vote against Mr Prabowo’s 44 per cent.</p>
    <p>Poll­sters have also cor­rectly pre­dicted the win­ners in pre­vi­ous re­gional elec­tions, par­tic­u­larly in the key provinces of South Su­ma­tra, West Java, Cen­tral Java, West Java and Su­lawesi. This is no mean feat con­sid­er­ing In­done­sia has more than 192 mil­lion reg­is­tered vot­ers spread across 17,000 is­lands.</p>
    <p>HIGH NON-RE­SPONSE RATE</p>
    <p>So how is it that In­done­sian poll­sters have got it right and their peers else­where, even in ad­vanced democ­ra­cies like the United States and Bri­tain, have stum­bled?</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ex­perts at­tribute the polling misses in the US, for in­stance, to un­der-rep­re­sen­ta­tion of cer­tain types of vot­ers. “The polls didn’t cap­ture enough Repub­li­cans and sup­port­ers of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, or they had too many Democrats or (Pres­i­dent-elect) Joe Bi­den sup­port­ers,” said Mr Scott Keeter, se­nior sur­vey ad­viser of the Wash­ing­ton-based Pew Re­search Cen­tre. “Some Trump sup­port­ers did not tell poll­sters they sup­ported him.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the poll­sters got Brexit wrong in Bri­tain in 2016, pre­dict­ing that Bri­tons would vote to stay in the Euro­pean Union. Opin­ion polls also in­di­cated a much tighter race in the 2015 gen­eral elec­tion, with the polls bi­ased to­wards the op­po­si­tion Labour Party be­cause those con­duct­ing the sur­veys spoke to too few sup­port­ers of the Con­ser­va­tives.</p>
    <p>This is a prob­lem ex­ac­er­bated by a his­tor­i­cally high non-re­sponse rate. Pew said the tele­phone re­sponse rate to public polls – one of the most com­mon sur­vey meth­ods – had dropped to 6 per cent this year from 36 per cent in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>This is per­haps where poll­sters in In­done­sia stand out. They had a rel­a­tively high re­sponse rate of 85-90 per cent last year – not least be­cause they col­lect data through face-to-face in­ter­views. It is an old-fash­ioned method that pro­duces the best data qual­ity, but is too costly for their coun­ter­parts in the US and the United King­dom .</p>
    <p>“We find tele­phone in­ter­views not rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the de­mo­graph­ics be­cause most of the in­ter­vie­wees be­long to the mid­dle class,” said Dr Dodi Am­bardi, for­mer ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of Lem­baga Survei In­done­sia. “But when we in­ter­view peo­ple face to face, the re­spon­dents tend to be very co­op­er­a­tive and are hon­est. The qual­ity of an­swers is just bet­ter when you meet them in per­son.”</p>
    <p>CON­TENTIOUS RACES</p>
    <p>Still, In­done­sia’s poll­sters have a harder time pre­dict­ing con­tentious races, like the April 2017 Jakarta gu­ber­na­to­rial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In that con­test, the widely pop­u­lar in­cum­bent Ba­suki “Ahok” Tja­haya Pur­nama seemed a shoo-in, only to see his chances up­ended by huge ral­lies or­gan­ised by hard­line Is­lamists over a ca­sual re­mark</p>
    <p>that he made about Is­lam.</p>
    <p>“When an elec­tion is highly com­pet­i­tive and vot­ers are highly po­larised, re­spon­dents tend to be re­luc­tant to hon­estly con­vey their po­lit­i­cal choices,” said Mr Arya Fer­nan­des, a re­searcher from the Jakarta-based Cen­tre for Strate­gic In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies. The in­sti­tute has mit­i­gated the prob­lem by al­low­ing re­spon­dents to an­swer anony­mously, he said.</p>
    <p>Poll­sters in In­done­sia can also be thrown off by loyal vot­ers from smaller par­ties.</p>
    <p>In the 2018 gu­ber­na­to­rial race in West Java, some poll­sters failed to pre­dict the late surge for the can­di­date Su­dra­jat, af­ter the Is­lamist party PKS en­dorsed him.</p>
    <p>“PKS has a rel­a­tively small group of sup­port­ers but these sup­port­ers are more loyal than any other party and they can be mo­bilised ef­fec­tively from all across the coun­try. Many polls man­aged to pre­dict the win­ner but some didn’t be­cause they couldn’t cap­ture all the PKS sup­port­ers in their sam­ple,” said Dr Dodi.</p>
    <p>THE GREAT UN­KNOWN</p>
    <p>For the re­gional elec­tions on Dec 9, poll­sters will have to over­come an even big­ger hur­dle: the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The poll­sters will still con­duct their sur­veys the same way even dur­ing the pan­demic,” said Dr Dodi. “There are con­tra­dic­tory ob­ser­va­tions about whether the pan­demic will dis­suade peo­ple from go­ing out to vote. I think the turnout in ur­ban ar­eas will be lower than in the ru­ral ar­eas and that will af­fect par­ties sup­ported by the mid­dle class. But we don’t know how that will af­fect the polls.”</p>
