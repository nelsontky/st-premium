    <p>•</p>
    <p>The gulf that still ex­ists be­tween Liver­pool and Chelsea was on show on Sun­day, as the Premier League cham­pi­ons se­cured a 2-0 win at Stam­ford Bridge in a match that was de­fined by the dif­fer­ing for­tunes of the world’s two most ex­pen­sive goal­keep­ers.</p>
    <p>Alis­son Becker’s record £67 mil­lion (S$117.2 mil­lion) move from Roma to Liver­pool in 2018 lasted just three weeks, be­fore Chelsea paid £72 mil­lion to buy Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga from Ath­letic Bil­bao.</p>
    <p>Just over two years on, there is no doubt who got value for money with Chelsea pre­pared to spend again to solve their goal­keeper cri­sis with the im­mi­nent ar­rival of Edouard Mendy from Rennes.</p>
    <p>Ar­riz­a­bal­aga’s lat­est calamity saw him gift pos­ses­sion to Sa­dio Mane for the Sene­galese’s sec­ond goal af­ter he had headed Liver­pool into the lead early in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>Chelsea’s de­ci­sion to spend £200 mil­lion in re­cent months be­fore ad­dress­ing their goal­keeper sit­u­a­tion raised questions be­fore the sea­son started as to their ti­tle cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>Just two games in, doubts over Ar­riz­a­bal­aga’s abil­ity to start for a ti­tle con­tender have proven well founded as he also let Le­an­dro Trossard’s long-range strike un­der his arm in last Mon­day’s 3-1 win at Brighton. Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard, how­ever, in­sists that Ar­riz­a­bal­aga needs more sup­port.</p>
    <p>He said: “He’s our player and it’s clear there are two games where we feel (he made mis­takes).</p>
    <p>“It’s a clear mis­take that’s cost us be­cause at that point we go on to have a penalty which we might score and those fine mar­gins change games at this level.</p>
    <p>“Kepa has to keep work­ing, he has to have sup­port around him.”</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard was dropped twice by Lam­pard in favour of 38-yearold Willy Ca­ballero last sea­son and it was not a sur­pris­ing call.</p>
    <p>Ar­riz­a­bal­aga had the low­est save per­cent­age of any goal­keeper to play at least 10 games in the Premier League last term and con­ceded 10 more goals than he should have, ac­cord­ing to Opta’s expected goals met­ric.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool now boasts one of the best goal­keep­ers in the world as Alis­son showed by sav­ing Jorginho’s penalty on Sun­day, hav­ing had barely any­thing to do for the first 75 min­utes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it was not so long ago that Klopp found him­self in a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion to Lam­pard. Af­ter reach­ing the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal and fin­ish­ing fourth in the Premier League in 2017-18, Klopp’s side were clearly on the rise.</p>
    <p>But two cat­a­strophic er­rors from Loris Kar­ius in the 3-1 fi­nal de­feat by Real Madrid in Kiev con­vinced the Ger­man and the Liver­pool hi­er­ar­chy that they needed a top goal­keeper to win ma­jor tro­phies again.</p>
    <p>Six weeks later, Alis­son ar­rived at An­field and has played a ma­jor part in win­ning the Cham­pi­ons League and Premier League over the past two sea­sons.</p>
    <p>“Even at 2-0, we could have scored more but we didn’t and the game is open,” said Klopp, whose side played against 10 men af­ter Chelsea de­fender An­dreas Chris­tensen was red-carded for pulling down Mane just be­fore half-time.</p>
    <p>“We pro­duce the penalty, then Ali had to make the save. This is a proper team per­for­mance, ev­ery­body had to work hard.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea have spent big on the likes of Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Ben Chilwell. But with­out a world-class goal­keeper be­hind them, the ti­tle may be beyond their reach.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool, with a sturdy Alis­son be­tween the posts, ended the week with an even stronger squad than they boasted the pre­vi­ous week­end, and Klopp could barely con­tain a smile.</p>
    <p>Thi­ago Al­can­tara, signed for £20 mil­lion from Bay­ern Mu­nich on Fri­day, came off the bench at half-time to slot seam­lessly into the mid­field. The Spa­niard did con­cede the penalty which Jorginho missed, but ac­cord­ing to Opta, he com­pleted more passes (75) in 45 min­utes than any Chelsea player man­aged in the en­tire match.</p>
    <p>“I liked his game a lot. De­fen­sively it was tricky for him, but of­fen­sively, with the ball, that’s him, he wants to pass the ball,” Klopp said. “Ev­ery­thing he did to­day was com­pletely nat­u­ral.”</p>
    <p>Fac­tor i n the sign­ing of Por­tuguese for­ward Diogo Jota, re­cruited from Wolves on Satur­day, and no won­der Klopp l ooked happy.</p>
    <p>COSTLY ER­ROR</p>
    <p>It’s a clear mis­take that’s cost us be­cause at that point we go on to have a penalty which we might score and those fine mar­gins change games at this level.</p>
