    <p>How do ne­go­tia­tors strike a trade deal us­ing com­plex is­sues such as in­ter­op­er­a­ble dig­i­tal iden­tity, data lo­cal­i­sa­tion and cross-bor­der data flows as bar­gain­ing chips?</p>
    <p>If the ne­go­tia­tors are from Sin­ga­pore, the an­swer is: with­out great dif­fi­culty, since there is a good chance some of them are tech geeks.</p>
    <p>That geek­i­ness came in handy when Sin­ga­pore em­barked on ne­go­ti­at­ing Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Agree­ments (DEAs). The pacts are all about fos­ter­ing col­lab­o­ra­tion and fu­ture align­ment with other coun­tries on dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture, stan­dards and emerg­ing cross-bor­der is­sues faced by dig­i­tal busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, while pre­par­ing for the next round of ne­go­ti­a­tions, there were mo­ments where one or the other mem­bers of the team would com­pletely geek out about this or that tech is­sue,” said Ms Tan Lay Lin, direc­tor of the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try’s (MTI) In­ter­na­tional Trade Clus­ter and co-chief ne­go­tia­tor of the Sin­ga­pore-Aus­tralia DEA. “It was funny at times, but it ac­tu­ally helped.”</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, the Repub­lic did not just rely on the geek­i­ness of its ne­go­tia­tors. The DEA ini­tia­tive is an in­ter-agency ef­fort co-led by MTI, the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion and the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA).</p>
    <p>It also re­quires the ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion of other agen­cies, such as the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore,</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice.</p>
    <p>Given that the con­cept of a DEA is so niche, it takes hard work putting one to­gether.</p>
    <p>Un­like free trade agree­ments (FTAs), which have been around for nearly 20 years, there was no tem­plate for DEAs. Ev­ery­thing had to be done from scratch.</p>
    <p>Then the coro­n­avirus out­break threw a span­ner in the works.</p>
    <p>Trade ne­go­ti­a­tions are usu­ally done face to face, but Covid-19 meant all meet­ings be­tween the ne­go­ti­at­ing team in Sin­ga­pore and the other side had to be done vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan Kah Mei, deputy direc­tor of the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion, IMDA, said: “The choice of plat­form to put to­gether a con­fer­ence call be­came a mat­ter of dis­cus­sion. Then of course, there was the is­sue of tim­ing the call given the time zone dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>At least once, the team had to wake up at 4am to join a round of ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the rel­a­tively easy part of ne­go­ti­at­ing a DEA was the fact that both sides were ea­ger to put the agree­ment to­gether.</p>
    <p>“FTA talks can some­times get a bit ac­ri­mo­nious as a kind of give and take is in­volved,” said Ms Chan, who was the co-chief ne­go­tia­tor of the Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Part­ner­ship Agree­ment with New Zealand and Chile.</p>
    <p>“But the ne­go­ti­at­ing process for the DEAs was rel­a­tively smooth as both sides wanted to talk about those things and come to an agree­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>The ea­ger­ness or like-mind­ed­ness of the ne­go­ti­at­ing teams took off some of the bur­den of un­der­stand­ing some of the more com­plex tech­no­log­i­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mr Ivan Koh, direc­tor of IMDA’s Tech­nol­ogy Gov­er­nance Of­fice, said: “The talks were some­times a</p>
    <p>learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, as both sides would share their ex­per­tise on the sub­ject un­der dis­cus­sion.”</p>
    <p>The “can do” spirit of the Sin­ga­pore team and the co­op­er­a­tive at­ti­tude of trad­ing part­ners have laid down a solid foun­da­tion for the DEAs to come, given that col­lab­o­ra­tion and part­ner­ship are es­sen­tial el­e­ments in th­ese agree­ments, he added.</p>
