    <p>NEW YORK • US daily coro­n­avirus cases rose 2.2 per cent on Sun­day, above the 1.9 per cent daily av­er­age over the last week, ac­cord­ing to data col­lected by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity and Bloomberg News.</p>
    <p>It recorded 63,872 new coro­n­avirus cases in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours on Sun­day, Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity re­ported in its real-time tally, putting the to­tal num­ber of cases in the US at 3,762,081.</p>
    <p>An­other 514 deaths were re­ported, bring­ing to­tal fa­tal­i­ties to 140,474.</p>
    <p>Still, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, in a Fox News in­ter­view broad­cast on Sun­day, de­fended his han­dling of the pan­demic, claim­ing that the United States was “the envy of the world” on test­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to his early pre­dic­tion that the virus would dis­ap­pear, he said: “I’ll be right even­tu­ally.”</p>
    <p>He again op­posed any na­tional man­date for mask wear­ing, say­ing: “I want peo­ple to have a cer­tain free­dom.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also said with­out ev­i­dence that the US has the “best mor­tal­ity rate”, as a poll gave Mr Joe Bi­den, his Demo­cratic challenger in Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, a 15 per­cent­age point lead over him.</p>
    <p>Talks on a new coro­n­avirus stim­u­lus pack­age were to start at the White House yes­ter­day with Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell, Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin and oth­ers, said Mr Trump’s chief of staff Mark Mead­ows on Fox News Chan­nel.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is baulk­ing at US$25 bil­lion (S$35 bil­lion) in new fund­ing favoured by Repub­li­can law­mak­ers to help states with coro­n­avirus test­ing and con­tact trac­ing, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>As part of his broader eco­nomic plan, Mr Bi­den is ex­pected to pro­pose new poli­cies as soon as this week to in­crease jobs in child­care, el­der­care and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has cau­tioned against re­open­ing the econ­omy with­out first ramp­ing up coro­n­avirus test­ing.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent, who over­saw US stim­u­lus spend­ing af­ter the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, said house­holds – as well as lo­cal gov­ern­ments – need more sup­port to get through the shut­down.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les Mayor Eric Garcetti has mean­while warned that the city is on the brink of an­other stay-athome or­der.</p>
    <p>Such an or­der was an op­tion, Mr Garcetti, a Demo­crat, said on CNN’s State of the Union show on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>But he em­pha­sised that the city still had room in hos­pi­tals and is test­ing ag­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>The Mayor said he favours a “sur­gi­cal” re­sponse “rather than a cleaver that would just shut every­thing down”.</p>
    <p>New cases in Cal­i­for­nia have ac­cel­er­ated. Cal­i­for­nia re­ported 9,329 new cases on Sun­day, more than the 14-day av­er­age of 8,487, ac­cord­ing to the health de­part­ment’s web­site. There have been 384,692 con­firmed cases of coro­n­avirus in the state. Deaths climbed by 90 to 7,685.</p>
    <p>The pace of deaths has slowed in Ari­zona and Florida.</p>
    <p>Florida, how­ever, hit its fifth con­sec­u­tive day of cases over 10,000, as Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Donna Sha­lala called the state’s out­break “totally out of con­trol”.</p>
    <p>Deaths in hard-hit Ari­zona re­treated from a record re­ported last Satur­day of 147. An­other 31 fa­tal­i­ties were re­ported.</p>
    <p>Daily cases were be­low the weekly av­er­age.</p>
    <p>New York City was set for the phase four re­open­ing yes­ter­day, which is the fi­nal phase.</p>
    <p>New York re­ported 502 new virus cases on Sun­day, a 0.1 per cent rise com­pared with the weekly av­er­age in­crease of 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>An­other 13 deaths were re­ported. Zoos and botan­i­cal gar­dens could open again, and movie shoots could re­sume. Sports events are al­lowed, but with no fans. Gyms and mu­se­ums will still be shut, and in­door din­ing is still barred.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said that in New York City, bars and restau­rants would be sub­ject to a spe­cial “three strikes and you’re closed” reg­i­men.</p>
    <p>If they over­looked vi­o­la­tions of so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules or al­lowed cus­tomers to drink with­out or­der­ing food, they could lose their liquor li­cences af­ter three vi­o­la­tions.</p>
