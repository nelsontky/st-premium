    <p>Non-Con­stituency MP ( NCMP) Leong Mun Wai has called for im­me­di­ate ac­tion to be taken to re­store the bal­ance of in­ter­ests be­tween Sin­ga­pore­ans and for­eign­ers in the coun­try, in view of con­cerns raised by lo­cals about dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Not­ing there are “seem­ingly fewer good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans”, he urged the Govern­ment to re­duce work pass ap­provals and re­newals in the short term to chan­nel more ex­ist­ing jobs to Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, who is from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP), as­sured the House, how­ever, that his party will “up­hold this Par­lia­ment as a Sin­ga­porean Par­lia­ment, and not a par­ti­san Par­lia­ment”, and said he looked for­ward to more in­for­ma­tion and re­sources be­ing given to the op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment so it can be an ef­fec­tive voice and gen­er­a­tor of ideas.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong and Ms Hazel Poa were cho­sen by PSP to take up its NCMP slots. They were part of the PSP team in West Coast GRC that emerged as the top loser in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, mak­ing them el­i­gi­ble for the seats.</p>
    <p>In his maiden par­lia­men­tary speech, Mr Leong said the PSP strongly sup­ports an open econ­omy and so­ci­ety, but added that some ad­just­ments can be made to the coun­try’s im­mi­gra­tion pol­icy, in­clud­ing the way the pol­icy is com­mu­ni­cated.</p>
    <p>“The for­eign tal­ent model, which in­volves the com­pe­ti­tion for jobs in our own ter­ri­tory, is es­pe­cially sen­si­tive,” he noted, as he called for more data to get cit­i­zens’ buy-in.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it would be use­ful to reg­u­larly dis­close statis­tics for pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian jobs, bro­ken down into cit­i­zen and per­ma­nent res­i­dent cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>“With­out clearer data, Sin­ga­pore­ans can­not have an in­formed dis­cus­sion on whether the ex­ist­ing for­eign tal­ent model is ben­e­fit­ing us.”</p>
    <p>Mr Leong pro­posed group­ing com­pa­nies into two cat­e­gories: off­shore and on­shore com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Off­shore com­pa­nies, with prod­ucts and ser­vices sold pre­dom­i­nantly over­seas that Sin­ga­pore­ans do not yet have the skills to pro­duce, can be given more lat­i­tude to tap tal­ent from all over the world.</p>
    <p>But this is con­di­tional on their up­hold­ing the non-dis­crim­i­na­tion prin­ci­ple to­wards Sin­ga­pore­ans and fol­low­ing the min­i­mum salary re­quire­ments for Em­ploy­ment Pass and S Pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>In the on­shore cat­e­gory, reg­u­la­tions and pro­ce­dures will be tight­ened. Elab­o­rat­ing, he said: “We stip­u­late that Sin­ga­pore­ans must be well rep­re­sented in the top man­age­ment and hu­man re­source func­tions to en­sure that the pro­ce­dures are fol­lowed prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>A for­eigner-to-cit­i­zen ra­tio cap should be ap­plied to all such com­pa­nies and their var­i­ous de­part­ments, and Sin­ga­pore should pro­tect en­try-level jobs for its new grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>He also said there should be a suc­ces­sion plan to re­place each for­eign man­ager at the end of his visa pe­riod, with a fur­ther visa ex­ten­sion granted only if the man­ager is due for pro­mo­tion and his pre­vi­ous po­si­tion is taken up by a Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong added that cit­i­zen­ship should be awarded only to per­ma­nent res­i­dents who have lived in Sin­ga­pore for a long time, and have passed a stricter set of nat­u­ral­i­sa­tion cri­te­ria. He called for a cit­i­zens’ com­mis­sion to be set up to over­see the award of cit­i­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>“Cit­i­zen­ship is sacro­sanct to Sin­ga­pore­ans who are jus­ti­fi­ably con­cerned about the ero­sion of na­tional iden­tity and the di­lu­tion of our cit­i­zen­ship.”</p>
    <p>NEED FOR MORE DATA</p>
    <p>With­out clearer data, Sin­ga­pore­ans can­not have an in­formed dis­cus­sion on whether the ex­ist­ing for­eign tal­ent ’’ model is ben­e­fit­ing us. NON-CON­STITUENCY MP LEONG MUN WAI, call­ing for more data to get cit­i­zens’ buy-in on the for­eign tal­ent model.</p>
    <p>MORE SIN­GA­PORE­ANS IN FIRMS</p>
    <p>We stip­u­late that Sin­ga­pore­ans must be well rep­re­sented in the top man­age­ment and hu­man re­source func­tions to en­sure that the pro­ce­dures are fol­lowed ’’ prop­erly.</p>
    <p>MR LEONG, on hav­ing tight­ened reg­u­la­tions and pro­ce­dures for what he calls on­shore com­pa­nies.</p>
