    <p>Dr Li Shengwu has said he will pay a $15,000 fine for con­tempt of court, but he does not ad­mit guilt and dis­agrees that he has said any­thing il­le­gal in a pri­vate Face­book post.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, he wrote that he has de­cided to pay the fine “in or­der to buy some peace and quiet”. Dr Li said: “Pay­ing the fine avoids giv­ing the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment an easy ex­cuse to at­tack me and my fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>The fine is due to­day. Dr Li added: “The true scan­dal is the mis­use of state re­sources to re­press pri­vate speech.</p>
    <p>“In the course of this three-year pros­e­cu­tion, the Sin­ga­pore At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers has writ­ten thou­sands of pages of le­gal doc­u­ments, sup­pressed parts of my defence af­fi­davit, and de­manded that I re­veal to them all of my friends on Face­book,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Li, a Har­vard Univer­sity as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of eco­nom­ics liv­ing in the United States, was sen­tenced to a $15,000 fine af­ter the High Court here found him guilty of con­tempt of court last month.</p>
    <p>He was or­dered to pay the fine within two weeks or serve a de­fault sen­tence of one week’s jail. He was also or­dered to pay $8,500 for le­gal costs and $8,070.69 for dis­burse­ments to the At­tor­neyGen­eral’s Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>Dr Li is the grand­son of found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew and the son of Mr Lee Hsien Yang, who is Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s brother.</p>
    <p>Dr Li was found guilty over a 2017 pri­vate Face­book post in which he wrote that the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment is “very liti­gious and has a pli­ant court sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>His post also in­cluded a link to a 2010 New York Times editorial that crit­i­cised his grand­fa­ther for run­ning “an au­thor­i­tar­ian regime” that cowed crit­ics through li­bel ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Kan­nan Ramesh found that Dr Li’s post “con­veys the mean­ing that the ju­di­ciary is not in­de­pen­dent and im­par­tial, and is sus­cep­ti­ble to in­flu­ence or pres­sure from the Gov­ern­ment where le­gal pro­ceed­ings are brought by its lead­ers”.</p>
