    <p>A mod­i­fied can­cer drug is vy­ing to end the global quest for a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>De­vel­oped by re­searchers from the National Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore and Monash Uni­ver­sity in Aus­tralia, the vac­cine has un­der­gone an­i­mal stud­ies and will be ready for clin­i­cal tri­als by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Known as a fu­sion pro­tein vac­cine, it com­bines an an­ti­body which tar­gets a spe­cific part of the im­mune sys­tem with an anti­gen, which in­duces an im­mune re­sponse. It is tai­lored to be ef­fec­tive in treat­ing the el­derly al­though it is suit­able for all ages.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the num­ber of new cases in Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ued to re­main low, with 18 cases con­firmed yes­ter­day. The Health Min­istry said four of th­ese were im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>One, a work per­mit holder, was the only case in the community, while there were 13 cases re­sid­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts are also racing to de­velop safe, vi­able sys­tems to trans­port vac­cines when they are ready.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­tics firms in the United States are work­ing on chal­lenges such as ob­tain­ing enough glass vials for the vac­cines, and keep­ing them at tem­per­a­tures of about mi­nus 80 deg C dur­ing trans­porta­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers from the National Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) and Aus­tralia’s Monash Uni­ver­sity are de­vel­op­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine that could be ready for clin­i­cal tri­als by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, mod­i­fied from a can­cer drug, has un­der­gone an­i­mal stud­ies, and re­searchers are hop­ing to con­duct clin­i­cal tri­als in Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Called Clec9A-RBD, it is the third coro­n­avirus vac­cine that Sin­ga­pore is in­volved in de­vel­op­ing.</p>
    <p>Known as a fu­sion pro­tein vac­cine, it is made by com­bin­ing an an­ti­body that tar­gets parts of the im­mune sys­tem with an anti­gen, which in­duces an im­mune re­sponse to pro­tect against a cho­sen pathogen.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists can there­fore rely on the same an­ti­body to fight dif­fer­ent dis­eases by sim­ply switch­ing the anti­gen at­tached to it, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mireille La­houd from the Monash Uni­ver­sity Biomedicin­e Dis­cov­ery In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times yes­ter­day the an­ti­body in Clec9A-RBD had pre­vi­ously been used to cre­ate vac­cines to fight a va­ri­ety of dis­eases such as can­cer and in­fluenza.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic struck in Fe­bru­ary, she and two other re­searchers de­cided to use it to make a vac­cine that could fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine tar­gets a spe­cific part of the im­mune sys­tem known as den­dritic cells, which “sam­ple” parts of the en­vi­ron­ment around them and flag dan­gers to the rest of the im­mune sys­tem. Prof La­houd said: “If you want to de­liver a vac­cine... they’re the cells you want to tar­get.”</p>
    <p>The re­searchers de­vel­oped a pro­tein that binds to a re­cep­tor on th­ese cells, teach­ing the im­mune sys­tem to fight off Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Three main things set this vac­cine apart from oth­ers in the global race, said the re­searchers.</p>
    <p>First, it is “very good” at stim­u­lat­ing the weak im­mune sys­tems of the el­derly, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Sylvie Alonso from the depart­ment of mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy and im­munol­ogy at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>Prof Alonso, who co-leads the school’s in­fec­tious dis­ease trans­la­tional re­search pro­gramme, ex­plained that this is be­cause the den­dritic cells it tar­gets are present in sig­nif­i­cant quan­ti­ties in hu­mans through­out their en­tire life­span.</p>
    <p>This means a vac­cine that tar­gets such cells will likely be as ef­fec­tive on the el­derly as it is on the young.</p>
    <p>This is sup­ported by an­i­mal mod­els the team has run, us­ing mice.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the vac­cine re­quires only a sin­gle dose and a small amount of anti­gen due to its tar­geted de­liv­ery sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Prof Alonso said: “Th­ese are at­tributes that are es­sen­tial in a pan­demic sit­u­a­tion, where you need to pro­duce mil­lions of doses.”</p>
    <p>She added that one fail­ing of multi-shot vac­cines is that peo­ple who have been in­jected with the first dose may feel safe from the virus and not come back for the es­sen­tial sec­ond or third jab.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, due to its na­ture as a fu­sion pro­tein vac­cine, Clec9A-RBD can po­ten­tially be adapted to fight not just Sars-CoV-2, but coro­n­avirus mu­ta­tions and other new dis­eases in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Prof La­houd said: “I’m hop­ing for a vac­cine for Covid-19, but also to de­velop this so that we are fu­ture­proof­ing. Once we’ve es­tab­lished this, we’ll be able to ap­ply it to what­ever (dis­ease) comes next.”</p>
    <p>The re­searchers are seek­ing ap­proval and fund­ing to fur­ther their re­search, and in­tend to ap­proach the health au­thor­i­ties in both coun­tries in the com­ing months.</p>
