    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in yes­ter­day called for le­gal penal­ties for those ob­struct­ing anti-virus curbs. While many cases in the cur­rent spike have been mem­bers of a church, a clus­ter of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Seoul was threat­en­ing to spread af­ter thou­sands of peo­ple at­tended a po­lit­i­cal rally last week.</p>
    <p>• South Korea’s health au­thor­i­ties warned yes­ter­day that a clus­ter of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in the cap­i­tal Seoul was threat­en­ing to spread af­ter thou­sands of peo­ple at­tended a mas­sive rally against Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>While many of the cases in the cur­rent spike have been among mem­bers of a church – some of whom at­tended the rally – of­fi­cials said more peo­ple need to come for­ward and be tested to head off an un­con­trol­lable out­break.</p>
    <p>Amid govern­ment com­plaints that some churches had not been co­op­er­at­ing with health of­fi­cials and were flout­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing in­struc­tions, Pres­i­dent Moon yes­ter­day called for penal­ties for any­one ob­struct­ing anti-virus mea­sures, in­clud­ing those con­duct­ing “all-out mis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns”.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon’s of­fice said it would be im­ple­ment­ing an emer­gency re­sponse sys­tem, in­clud­ing high­level meet­ings ev­ery morn­ing and 24-hour work sched­ules, un­til the cri­sis has passed.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion re­ported 324 new cases as of Thurs­day mid­night, the high­est daily count since March 8. The coun­try now has 16,670 cases, with 309 deaths.</p>
    <p>While most of the new cases are in Seoul and the sur­round­ing ar­eas, new cases have also been re­ported in 16 prov­inces and metropoli­tan ar­eas, said the di­rec­tor of the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are very wor­ried about a pos­si­ble na­tion­wide out­break,” said Ms Jeong Eun-kyeong.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment is try­ing to gather the names of ev­ery­one who at­tended last week’s rally, as well as the names of the driv­ers who drove at­ten­dees from the prov­inces, Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kim Gang-lip told a sep­a­rate brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Health in­ves­ti­ga­tors and po­lice had ob­tained the mo­bile phone lo­ca­tion data of at least 12,000 peo­ple who had been in the area, and were seek­ing to con­vince the Sarang Jeil Church to hand over a full list of its mem­bers, the vice­health min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>Last night, po­lice ex­e­cuted a search war­rant at the church’s of­fice to gather mem­ber­ship lists, church of­fi­cial Lee Dong-ho told</p>
    <p>Reuters. Some church mem­bers, who are vo­cal crit­ics of the Moon ad­min­is­tra­tion, have ac­cused the govern­ment of con­duct­ing a po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated witch hunt.</p>
    <p>As of Thurs­day, 739 peo­ple linked to the church were con­firmed pos­i­tive for the virus, the health au­thor­i­ties said. Some Sarang Jeil Church mem­bers say the govern­ment is fab­ri­cat­ing the test re­sults as part of a plot to per­se­cute them.</p>
    <p>If the new in­fec­tion num­bers in South Korea do not fall over the week­end, the govern­ment could im­pose its strictest rules, in­clud­ing clos­ing schools, Ms Jeong said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Moon’s ap­proval rat­ing rose for the first time in three months af­ter he took on the Sarang Jeil Church – a rat­ing jump sim­i­lar to one in March when he con­fronted an­other con­tro­ver­sial re­li­gious group, the Shin­cheonji Church of Je­sus, over an out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon’s sup­port surged 8 per­cent­age points to 47 per cent in a weekly track­ing poll re­leased yes­ter­day by Gallup Korea. It was the high­est level since mid-July and up from a record low last week.</p>
