    <p>NEW YORK • Se­rial en­tre­pre­neur Tif­fany Zhong, 23, de­scribes her­self as the “Gen Z Whis­perer”.</p>
    <p>She names her com­pa­nies af­ter emoji, in­clud­ing Ze­bra IQ, a plat­form that helps con­tent cre­ators make money from their au­di­ences, and Pineap­ple Cap­i­tal, an earlystage “mini fund” that in­vests in con­sumer brands.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, Ms Zhong likes to get in on com­pa­nies early. At 21, she was the first in­vestor in Kin­ship, a skin­care la­bel that is about to hit the shelves at hun­dreds of Ulta Beauty stores in the United States.</p>
    <p>All six products in the col­lec­tion, in­clud­ing In­sta Swipe al­pha hy­droxy acid wipes and Pim­ple Po­tion acne treat­ment, were cre­ated for Gen­er­a­tion Z.</p>
    <p>For more than two years, Kin­ship founders Christin Pow­ell and Ali­son Haljun worked with a Kin­ship Cir­cle of 20 Gen Z-ers to de­velop products.</p>
    <p>Today, the Kin­ship Cir­cle is made up of 125 young peo­ple who give in­put on logo, colour, ty­pog­ra­phy, pack­ag­ing de­sign and beta prod­uct test­ing.</p>
    <p>Self Re­flect sun­screen, with its airy, whipped tex­ture and vanilla scent, was for­merly Golden Milk Latte, which had a heav­ier sun pro­tec­tion fac­tor and notes of turmeric and car­damom.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal ver­sion was scrapped, Ms Pow­ell said, be­cause the Kin­ship Cir­cle found it too “spicy” and the tex­ture lack­ing.</p>
    <p>Gen Z-ers “care a lot about see­ing what is hap­pen­ing be­hind the scenes, get­ting a trans­par­ent look into things”, Ms Zhong said.</p>
    <p>Equally crit­i­cal to her is that a beauty line is eco-friendly, ve­gan, cru­elty-free and “stands up for what’s right”.</p>
    <p>So what does it mean to be a beauty brand for Gen Z today?</p>
    <p>A com­pany can­not just sell skin­care, cos­met­ics, hair care or per­fume.</p>
    <p>Good prod­uct mat­ters, but what mat­ters more is stand­ing for some­thing, whether it is be­ing cru­el­tyfree (E.L.F. Cos­met­ics) or sim­ply be­ing the best ver­sion of your­self (Glossier).</p>
    <p>It can­not po­litely sit out seismic cul­tural mo­ments. There is an ex­pec­ta­tion of comment on sustainabi­lity, so­cial jus­tice, po­lice re­form and, soon, a pres­i­den­tial election.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers demand it, es­pe­cially those un­der 25 who make up Gen Z, also known as the ac­tivist gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to be the group that’s driv­ing spend­ing and de­ci­sions for many years to come,” said Ms Mary Dil­lon, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Ulta.</p>
    <p>“They’re su­per-in­flu­en­tial. All you have to do is look at the racial injustice dis­cus­sion and di­a­logue we’ve had in the last few months. Gen Z is lead­ing the way.”</p>
    <p>Ulta has be­come the go-to pur­veyor of teenage beauty, ac­cord­ing to data from in­vest­ment bank Piper San­dler.</p>
    <p>Of the 5,200 teenagers sur­veyed by the firm, 39 per cent said Ulta was their top des­ti­na­tion for beauty pur­chases, fol­lowed by Sephora with 24 per cent.</p>
    <p>Spring 2019 was the first time Ulta was crowned the favourite beauty des­ti­na­tion for teenagers.</p>
    <p>How did a store once associated with cheap drug­store make-up and sub­ur­ban strip malls be­come so pop­u­lar with this de­mo­graphic?</p>
    <p>Be­cause it is just about the only place you can find Gen Z sta­ples like Mor­phe, Kylie Cos­met­ics and Sugar Rush, Tarte’s lit­tle sis­ter line.</p>
    <p>Ulta also sells drug­store sta­ples from E.L.F. Cos­met­ics and May­belline next to more ex­pen­sive brands like Anas­ta­sia Bev­erly Hills, an al­lur­ing propositio­n to Gen Z-ers who are value-con­scious and mix high and low.</p>
    <p>This de­mo­graphic’s prom was can­celled, they do not know if they are go­ing to col­lege this month, and chances are they grew up with at least one par­ent out of work dur­ing the fi­nan­cial re­ces­sion of 2008.</p>
    <p>Gen Z-ers pore over in­gre­di­ent la­bels and re­views on­line; they want to know what they are putting on their skin and what it is do­ing for them.</p>
    <p>“If some­thing is cheap, it’s not nec­es­sar­ily bad,” said Ro­ge­lio Munoz-Franco, 15. “If some­thing is ex­pen­sive, it’s not nec­es­sar­ily good.”</p>
    <p>This sen­ti­ment was unan­i­mous among the 13 peo­ple aged 12 to 23 who were i nter­viewed for this story.</p>
    <p>Many are reg­u­lar users of The Inkey List and The Or­di­nary, which sells serums for about US$7 (S$9.60), or fol­low rec­om­men­da­tions from Gen Z skin­care or­a­cle Hyram Yar­bro, cre­ator of the line Skin Care by Hyram.</p>
    <p>Yar­bro, 24, has had a me­te­oric rise. He went from hav­ing just un­der 100,000 TikTok fol­low­ers in March to more than five mil­lion today.</p>
    <p>He cred­its the spike to in­ter­est in skin­care dur­ing quar­an­tine as well as his fo­cus on re­view­ing cheaper products, which he said are not much dif­fer­ent, in terms of in­gre­di­ents, than “ex­treme l ux­ury” items.</p>
    <p>Gen Z-ers pos­sess a dis­tinct set of beauty and groom­ing habits, at­ti­tudes and buy­ing pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Many grav­i­tate to­wards an un­var­nished aes­thetic from brands that are pro­gres­sive in the im­agery they use.</p>
    <p>Teenagers do not want a “full beat” or the over­done In­sta­gram face that de­fined a gen­er­a­tion of mil­len­nial in­flu­encers who were one cos­metic pro­ce­dure away from look­ing like a Kar­dashian.</p>
    <p>“Their in­tel­lec­tual take on beauty is di­vorced from the mil­len­nial idea, which is In­sta­gram fil­ter, hav­ing the per­fect lip and look­ing like an ide­alised beauty,” said Ms Lu­cie Greene, founder of Light Years, a con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>She pointed to singer Bil­lie Eil­ish, cred­it­ing the 18-year-old with in­spir­ing a “com­pet­i­tive cre­ativ­ity” – the an­tithe­sis of air­brush­ing or per­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about the male gaze,” Ms Greene said. “It’s her ex­pres­sion of her­self.”</p>
    <p>This is why the very mil­len­ni­alpink brand Glossier is such a hit with this crowd.</p>
    <p>When build­ing her com­pany, Ms Emily Weiss, the Glossier founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive, steered clear of pro­ject­ing a sin­gu­lar beauty ideal.</p>
    <p>In­stead of coax­ing cus­tomers to look like a model or celebrity, Ms Weiss en­cour­aged them to be “more like you” (but maybe a slightly dewier ver­sion).</p>
    <p>Ground­break­ing com­pa­nies are al­ways con­trar­ian, but what is con­sid­ered con­trar­ian is ever evolv­ing. Prob­a­bly no one would con­sider min­i­mal-pink brand­ing and fresh­faced “no-make-up make-up” a ground­break­ing idea, but what Ms Weiss, 35, set out to do nearly six years ago – cre­ate a beauty com­pany sold en­tirely on­line – was un­heard of.</p>
    <p>So was the way Glossier talked to and treated its con­sumers, com­mu­ni­cat­ing and op­er­at­ing as a “beauty BFF”.</p>
    <p>“What’s in­ter­est­ing about Glossier is we just hold up a mir­ror, and we’re, like, ‘We’re here to make you look more like you,’” Ms Weiss said.</p>
    <p>Ms Olamide Olowe, 23, co­founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Topi­cals, a new skin­care line de­signed to treat con­di­tions like eczema and hy­per­pig­men­ta­tion, has a sim­i­lar ethos.</p>
    <p>She raised more than US$2 mil­lion in ven­ture cap­i­tal fund­ing, with in­vestors that in­clude Mr Bo­zoma Saint John, the chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer of Net­flix.</p>
    <p>“The brands of yes­ter­day fo­cused on as­pi­ra­tion in mak­ing you want to be some­body,” said Ms Olowe, who is black. “Gen Z brands fo­cus on cel­e­brat­ing you in the way that you are.”</p>
    <p>In the 1990s and early aughts, MAC Cos­met­ics was cen­tred on di­ver­sity, self-ex­pres­sion and gen­der and sex­ual flu­id­ity – rad­i­cal ideas at the time that de­vi­ated from the beauty norms pro­moted by main­stream brands.</p>
    <p>The make-up artist brand was thriv­ing with the drag scene, while mil­len­ni­als were buy­ing Clin­ique’s clas­sic “3-Step Skin Care Sys­tem” (plus a free gift with pur­chase) at depart­ment store coun­ters.</p>
    <p>But as its con­sumers aged and depart­ment store beauty coun­ters were re­placed by Sephora and Ulta, MAC strug­gled to be rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>Last year, Mr Drew El­liott was brought in as the global cre­ative direc­tor to make the brand cool again. (He is the per­son re­spon­si­ble for the break-the-In­ter­net is­sue of Pa­per mag­a­zine with Kim Kar­dashian West’s glossy bare back­side on the cover.)</p>
    <p>One of his first projects was the MAC Un­der­ground col­lec­tion that came out dur­ing Pride month, the kick­off of a se­ries of limited-edi­tion drops.</p>
    <p>Each of the 1,000 units, which are num­bered, sold out in 55 min­utes, ac­cord­ing to the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“They’re mov­ing at the speed of the In­ter­net, not at the speed of a sup­ply chain,” Mr El­liott, 39, said of the Gen Z.</p>
    <p>“To just get some­thing out into the mar­ket within three months – for a make-up brand, that’s bonkers.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kory Marchisott­o, chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer of E.L.F. Cos­met­ics, was hired last year to mod­ernise the strug­gling (at the time) makeup brand.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has al­ways been ve­gan and cru­elty-free, with most of its products cost­ing about US$5 – im­por­tant val­ues to Gen Z-ers – but it was not pub­li­cised enough. Nor was the fact that “E.L.F.” stood for “Eyes Lips Face”.</p>
    <p>The brand in­vested heav­ily in a TikTok cam­paign to com­mu­ni­cate this to Gen Z users, many of whom were born at or around the same time E.L.F. Cos­met­ics was started in 2004.</p>
    <p>The Eyes Lips Face Chal­lenge was in­tro­duced on TikTok, and to date, the #eye­slips­face hash­tag has six bil­lion views, and there are 4.5 mil­lion pieces of user-gen­er­ated con­tent with the hash­tag.</p>
