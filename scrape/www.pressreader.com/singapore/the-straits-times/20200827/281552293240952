    <p>The po­lice han­dled 7,253 cases across 10 main cat­e­gories of scams in the six months to June 30 – a 139 per cent surge from the 3,027 in­ci­dents dealt with in the same pe­riod last year. The main cat­e­gories were e-com­merce and so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation ruses, po­lice data re­vealed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Fraud­sters are hav­ing a field day with a huge rise in the num­ber of peo­ple cheated in on­line scams.</p>
    <p>The po­lice han­dled 7,253 cases across 10 main cat­e­gories of scams in the six months to June 30 – a 139 per cent surge from the 3,027 in­ci­dents in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The main cat­e­gories were e-com­merce and so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation ruses, fol­lowed by loan and bank­ing-re­lated phish­ing fraud cases, data showed yes­ter­day. Other com­mon types in­volved credit-for­sex rack­ets, dodgy in­vest­ment of­fers, In­ter­net love scams and cases where crim­i­nals im­per­son­ated gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials from China.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures – part of the po­lice’s mid-year crime statis­tics – con­trib­uted pri­mar­ily to the 11.6 per cent rise in the to­tal num­ber of re­ported crimes. There were 18,121 of­fences re­ported in the first half of this year, up from 16,240 in the same pe­riod last year. But if scams were fac­tored out, over­all crime dropped 20.5 per cent to 10,151 cases.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said the sharp in­crease in on­line fraud was due to an in­crease in trans­ac­tions dur­ing the coro­n­avirus out­break. “Crim­i­nals have been tak­ing ad­van­tage of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion to find new vic­tims, by ex­ploit­ing the pub­lic’s fear and sense of un­cer­tainty,” they said.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce fraud was the most com­mon type of scam, with 2,089 cases re­ported in the first half of this year, up 73.8 per cent from 1,202 last year. Many of these were via plat­forms like Carousell, Shopee, Face­book and Lazada, and of­ten in­volved elec­tron­ics, gam­ing para­pher­na­lia, masks and hand sani­tiser – all in de­mand dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Scams cen­tred on so­cial me­dia im­per­son­ation were also an area of con­cern, with 1,175 cases in the first half, well up on the 83 in the same pe­riod last year. In­sta­gram and Face­book were the most com­monly used plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Con­men would im­per­son­ate friends or fam­ily mem­bers and trick vic­tims into re­veal­ing mo­bile num­bers, credit card data or one-time pass­words to sign up for fake con­tests or pro­mo­tions. The largest sum lost in a sin­gle case of this sort was $367,000, when a vic­tim re­sponded to a link on a pur­ported mone­tary grant sent to her on Mes­sen­ger. She re­vealed her bank ac­count de­tails and trans­ferred the sum to an un­known in­di­vid­ual in April.</p>
    <p>An­other fer­tile area for crooks cen­tred on fi­nance. Fraud re­lated to loans rose 56 per cent – from 650 in the first half of last year to 1,014 this year – and there were 898 recorded cases of bank­ing-re­lated phish­ing cons, a huge in­crease from the 34 last year.</p>
    <p>Scam­mers are also net­ting larger hauls. The 10 main fraud cat­e­gories re­sulted in vic­tims los­ing $82 mil­lion – 97.1 per cent up on the $41.6 mil­lion lost in the first half of last year.</p>
    <p>Po­lice prin­ci­pal psy­chol­o­gist Carolyn Misir said crim­i­nals have be­come more so­phis­ti­cated in their meth­ods and start by fil­ter­ing on­line pro­files to iden­tify and study po­ten­tial vic­tims. They also tap tech­nol­ogy like Pho­to­shop and bots, and gen­er­ate fake re­views to make their ruses seem as real as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod, scam­mers had height­ened lev­els of vic­tim ac­cess. More peo­ple were on­line buy­ing things and com­mu­ni­cat­ing with friends, and scam­mers found ways and means to ex­ploit these vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties,” she said, adding that crooks of­ten guide po­ten­tial vic­tims into think­ing less and “emot­ing” more by push­ing them into states of fear or panic, or by giv­ing their tar­gets lit­tle to no time to process the sit­u­a­tion log­i­cally.</p>
    <p>“You of­ten hear vic­tims say­ing, ‘I didn’t think be­fore shar­ing the one­time pass­word’, but we have to be vig­i­lant, as scams can hap­pen to any­one re­gard­less of age or ed­u­ca­tion level,” she said.</p>
    <p>EX­PLOIT­ING FEAR AMID PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nals have been tak­ing ad­van­tage of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion to find new vic­tims, by ex­ploit­ing the pub­lic’s fear ’’ and sense of un­cer­tainty.</p>
