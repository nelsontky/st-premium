    <p>De­spite grow­ing di­vi­sions in the world, Sin­ga­pore has to stay open in or­der to max­imise op­por­tu­ni­ties for its peo­ple, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it has to manage this open­ness and as­sure its cit­i­zens of a stake in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“We can­not sus­tain our open­ness if we do not pro­vide enough op­por­tu­ni­ties for our own peo­ple – it’s not so­cially or po­lit­i­cally sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>“The two things go to­gether.” He added that Sin­ga­pore can­not be a mid­dling busi­ness cen­tre, but a re­gional and global hub that is open to peo­ple as well as trade and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies, was speak­ing at a di­a­logue at the Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit yes­ter­day on the topic of An­tic­i­pat­ing A New World.</p>
    <p>The an­nual sum­mit gathers busi­ness and thought lead­ers to dis­cuss global trends, and is held vir­tu­ally this year due to Covid-19. It is usu­ally held around the same time as the Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix, which has been can­celled this year.</p>
    <p>In the ses­sion mod­er­ated by Banyan Tree Hold­ings ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Ho Kwon Ping, Mr Thar­man said there are a few ways in which the Repub­lic can stay open and yet “de­velop Sin­ga­pore­ans to the most”.</p>
    <p>First, de­velop Sin­ga­pore­ans at ev­ery skill level – by deep­en­ing their skills, mov­ing on to ad­ja­cent skills, or switch­ing sec­tors al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, in­cen­tivise firms to an­chor them­selves in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing their re­gional and global teams which have a mix of lo­cals and for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Third, en­sure fair hir­ing and pro­mo­tion prac­tices. The Gov­ern­ment takes this even more se­ri­ously now due to the eco­nomic down­turn and an era of slow growth, he said.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to lean against the firms that do not take that se­ri­ously and hold them ac­count­able.”</p>
    <p>Fourth, en­sure a diversity of na­tion­al­i­ties among the for­eign­ers who are here; and fi­nally, con­trol the over­all num­ber of for­eign­ers so that the “broad middle” of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety and the lower-in­come can en­joy op­por­tu­ni­ties and fair com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that the fun­da­men­tal aim is to max­imise op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, Mr Thar­man said this process is not an ex­act sci­ence and re­quires con­tin­u­ous work.</p>
    <p>While larger tech firms are thriv­ing amid ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion due to Covid-19, a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in many economies risk ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a “wipe­out” in the next few years, he said.</p>
    <p>“SMEs are not just part of an econ­omy; they are part of so­ci­ety. They em­ploy peo­ple, they are part of what con­sti­tutes a lo­cal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think we want to end up with a world, two years from now, where you have a more heav­ily con­cen­trated in­dus­try, where the win­ners might be do­ing well in their own right, but there is a bleak land­scape out­side of them.”</p>
    <p>To avoid this in Sin­ga­pore, he said, the Gov­ern­ment has given fis­cal sup­port to firms dur­ing the crisis, as well as car­ried out in­dus­try up­grad­ing strate­gies such as the in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion maps.</p>
    <p>He added that while it is not sus­tain­able for the Gov­ern­ment to shore up firms with ever in­creas­ing funds, it will have to play a larger co­or­di­nat­ing role so that the mar­ket econ­omy can func­tion well and so­ci­ety can stay co­he­sive.</p>
    <p>He out­lined three ways to do so: Work with in­dus­try, unions and ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions to en­sure that those who lose their jobs can get new ones quickly; put in place dig­i­tal plat­forms to help SMEs; and main­tain trust in so­ci­ety and avoid di­vi­sive­ness.</p>
    <p>He added: “The role of the state – to keep the cen­tre strong in so­ci­ety, to find ev­ery way in which con­tend­ing par­ties can find some ba­sis for con­sen­sus – that role, too, has grown.”</p>
