    <p>UNITED NEED TO SIGN DE­FEND­ERS</p>
    <p>With three weeks of the trans­fer win­dow left, the need for Manch­ester United to re­cruit de­fen­sive re­in­force­ments is painfully clear af­ter their back­line was ex­posed by Crys­tal Palace in a 3-1 home de­feat.</p>
    <p>Vic­tor Lin­de­lof en­dured a dif­fi­cult af­ter­noon, as he al­lowed Jef­frey Schlupp to get a cross into the box for Palace’s opener, be­fore con­ced­ing a sec­ond-half penalty and was also cul­pa­ble for the third goal.</p>
    <p>While Tot­ten­ham fans have worked them­selves into a frenzy over the loan sign­ing of Gareth Bale, Son He­ung-min and Harry Kane’s com­bi­na­tion in a 5-2 thrash­ing of Southamp­ton showed Jose Mour­inho will soon have a fright­en­ing front three to work with.</p>
    <p>Bale is not avail­able un­til late Oc­to­ber, leav­ing Son and Kane to shoul­der the at­tack­ing bur­den. That task would not be too oner­ous if they em­u­late the su­perb part­ner­ship that tore Southamp­ton to shreds.</p>
    <p>South Korea star Son bagged four goals, all of which were laid on by Kane, who notched Tot­ten­ham’s fifth him­self. To­gether they have com­bined for more Premier League goals (24) than any other duo in the com­pe­ti­tion since Au­gust 2015.</p>
    <p>CALVERT-LEWIN GROW­ING UN­DER ANCELOTTI</p>
    <p>Do­minic Calvert-Lewin’s first hat-trick in pro­fes­sional foot­ball showed all his preda­tory qual­i­ties – a clever back-heel, a lunge at the back post and a header that eased Ever­ton to a 5-2 home win over West Bromwich Al­bion. The 23-year-old has started ev­ery league game un­der man­ager Carlo Ancelotti, who has faith in the for­ward to fire the Tof­fees to the next level.</p>
