    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Shares i n the world’s top glove maker are try­ing to re­trace the losses caused in the wake of a de­ten­tion or­der by the United States on its prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Top Glove Corp’s shares in Kuala Lumpur rose as much as 15 per cent yes­ter­day af­ter slump­ing by al­most 10 per cent in the pre­vi­ous ses­sion for their steep­est drop in a month.</p>
    <p>Some in­vestors are spec­u­lat­ing that the com­pany will be able to ad­dress the con­cerns raised by the US as de­mand for gloves re­mains el­e­vated due to the still-widen­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Its Sin­ga­pore-listed shares also ral­lied as much as 15 per cent to $7.48 at one point.</p>
    <p>An eye-pop­ping 375 per cent year-to-date rally in the Malaysian­listed stock – mak­ing it the best per­form­ing across Asia’s and emerg­ing mar­kets’ main gauges this year – is show­ing some signs of cool­ing off.</p>
    <p>The stock lost 18 per cent in the three ses­sions through Thurs­day amid the reg­u­la­tory ac­tion in the US, one of its big­gest cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can ac­tion is “un­ex­pected but prob­a­bly im­ma­te­rial as the US needs more gloves”, said Mr Ross Cameron, a fund man­ager at North­cape Cap­i­tal, which overseas about US$7 bil­lion (S$9.7 bil­lion) in as­sets glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“The other play­ers are all run­ning at full ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Top Glove, which de­rives 25 per cent of its sales and or­ders from the US, is reach­ing out to US Cus­toms to un­der­stand the is­sue bet­ter and to re­solve the mat­ter within two weeks, ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Lim Wee Chai said.</p>
    <p>The af­fected units ac­count for 12.5 per cent of to­tal rev­enue, and the com­pany can still ship to the US through other units in­clud­ing As­pion, he said.</p>
    <p>The is­sue might be re­lated to for­eign labour, Mr Lim said, which the firm has worked to re­solve over the past few months by pay­ing back re­cruit­ment fees to its work­ers.</p>
    <p>If the is­sue is in­deed over “the pend­ing re­im­burse­ment to its work­ers, we ex­pect a res­o­lu­tion to come through sooner rather than later”, Cit­i­group an­a­lyst Me­gat Fais wrote in a note on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“A pro­longed ban on pa­per would be cat­a­strophic but un­likely in our view, es­pe­cially as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in the US re­mains chal­leng­ing,” he added in the note.</p>
