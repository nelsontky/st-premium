    <p>Ler Teck Siang, the doc­tor in­volved in the HIV reg­istry data leak in January last year, has been re­moved from the med­i­cal reg­is­ter, the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil’s (SMC) dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal said in its grounds of de­ci­sion re­leased on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old Sin­ga­porean, who was the for­mer head of the Min­istry of Health’s (MOH) Na­tional Pub­lic Health Unit, had helped his Amer­i­can for­mer part­ner Mikhy Far­rera-Brochez dupe the au­thor­i­ties into is­su­ing a work pass by ly­ing about Far­reraBroche­z’s HIV-pos­i­tive sta­tus.</p>
    <p>In its writ­ten find­ings, the tri­bunal, made up of Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Tan, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tan Tong Khee and le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cer Bala Reddy, found that Ler’s con­vic­tion by the courts on var­i­ous charges im­plied “a de­fect in char­ac­ter ren­der­ing (Ler) un­fit for his pro­fes­sion”.</p>
    <p>Ler’s con­duct in each of the charges he had been con­victed on caused se­vere harm, and the na­ture of the of­fences also showed that Ler’s de­gree of cul­pa­bil­ity was high.</p>
    <p>There­fore, the tri­bunal ruled, Ler should be served the most se­vere pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>Ler was last year sen­tenced to a two-year jail term for abet­ting Far­rera-Brochez to com­mit cheat­ing and for pro­vid­ing false in­for­ma­tion to the po­lice and the MOH.</p>
    <p>He was also sen­tenced to 15 months in jail for drug of­fences.</p>
    <p>The tri­bunal said it is not cor­rect for Ler to claim that no harm had been caused and that he had gained noth­ing from the com­mis­sion of the of­fences. “(Ler) had de­rived non­mon­e­tary gain from his com­mis­sion of the of­fences in the Pe­nal Code Charges, and had un­der­mined the safe­guards put in place by gov­ern­men­tal au­thor­i­ties for the main­te­nance of pub­lic health,” the tri­bunal con­cluded.</p>
    <p>It said that Ler, who rep­re­sented him­self in the Fe­bru­ary hear­ing, was not be­ing brought to task for a sim­ple dis­hon­est act, but for crim­i­nal con­vic­tions in­volv­ing fraud and dis­hon­esty. “(Ler) had en­gaged in the</p>
    <p>de­cep­tion of gov­ern­men­tal au­thor­i­ties not once, but four times... (Ler’s) four of­fences took place over the course of sev­eral years, with the false state­ments to the Min­istry of Health and the po­lice made in or­der to cover up his ear­lier wrong­do­ing, which could in no way be said to be a one-off lapse in judg­ment or oth­er­wise triv­ial,” the tri­bunal said.</p>
    <p>“This Tri­bunal is of the view that se­vere harm or po­ten­tial harm had been caused to pub­lic con­fi­dence in the pro­fes­sion, and the health and safety of the pub­lic, by (Ler’s) con­duct.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the ‘cul­pa­bil­ity’ el­e­ment, the most rel­e­vant fac­tor to be con­sid­ered in the present case is the ex­tent of pre­med­i­ta­tion and plan­ning in­volved, in­clud­ing the lengths to which the doc­tor went to cover up his or her mis­con­duct,” said the panel, which also or­dered Ler to bear the costs of the tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>The SMC was rep­re­sented by Mr Chia Voon Jiet and Mr Sim Bing Wen from law firm Drew & Napier.</p>
    <p>Ler’s le­gal trou­bles are not over. He is fac­ing a sep­a­rate charge un­der the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act for fail­ing to take rea­son­able care to re­tain pos­ses­sion of the in­for­ma­tion re­lat­ing to the HIV Reg­istry, as well as a charge for re­fus­ing to pro­vide a urine spec­i­men to nar­cotics of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Far­rera-Brochez, who is 35 this year, was last year sen­tenced by an Amer­i­can court to two years’ jail for us­ing a stolen HIV data­base from Sin­ga­pore to ex­tort from the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He has also been con­victed for ex­tort­ing the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment in two e-mails he sent, and for un­law­fully and know­ingly pos­sess­ing the HIV data­base, which con­tained the per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion de­tails of more than 14,000 peo­ple.</p>
