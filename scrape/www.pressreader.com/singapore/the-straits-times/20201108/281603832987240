    <p>WASH­ING­TON Ms Ka­mala Har­ris crashed through one of the world’s high­est glass ceil­ings yes­ter­day to be elected Amer­ica’s first woman vice-pres­i­dent, mak­ing his­tory and help­ing bring to an end Mr Don­ald Trump’s tur­bu­lent rule.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris came into last Tues­day’s elec­tion al­ready a re­peat trail­blazer as Cal­i­for­nia’s first black at­tor­ney-gen­eral and the first woman of South Asian her­itage elected to the United States Se­nate.</p>
    <p>By win­ning the vice-presidency, she will be a heart­beat away from lead­ing the US and poised on a step­ping stone to the ul­ti­mate prize.</p>
    <p>With Mr Joe Bi­den, 77, ex­pected to serve only a sin­gle term, Ms Har­ris would be favoured to win the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­na­tion four years from now.</p>
    <p>That could give her a shot at more his­tory-mak­ing – as the first fe­male pres­i­dent of the US.</p>
    <p>“This elec­tion is about so much more than Mr Joe Bi­den or me,” she wrote on Twit­ter after US news me­dia called the elec­tion in their favour based on state re­sults.</p>
    <p>“It’s about the soul of Amer­ica and our will­ing­ness to fight for it.</p>
    <p>“We have a lot of work ahead of us. Let’s get started.”</p>
    <p>Since be­ing tapped as Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate in Au­gust, she has slammed Mr Trump not only on his chaotic han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic, but also racism, the econ­omy and his crack­down on im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, 56, was born to im­mi­grants to the US – her father was from Ja­maica, her mother was from In­dia. Their lives and her own have in some ways em­bod­ied the Amer­i­can dream.</p>
    <p>She was born on Oct 20, 1964, in Oak­land, Cal­i­for­nia, then a hub for civil rights and anti-war ac­tivism.</p>
    <p>Her di­ploma from his­tor­i­cally black Howard Univer­sity in Wash­ing­ton was the start of a steady rise that took her from pros­e­cu­tor, to two elected terms as San Fran­cisco’s district at­tor­ney and then Cal­i­for­nia’s at­tor­ney-gen­eral in 2010.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ms Har­ris’ self-de­scrip­tion as a “pro­gres­sive pros­e­cu­tor” had been seized upon by crit­ics who said she fought to up­hold wrong­ful con­vic­tions and op­posed cer­tain re­forms in Cal­i­for­nia, like a Bill re­quir­ing that the at­tor­ney­gen­eral probe shoot­ings in­volv­ing po­lice.</p>
    <p>“Time after time, when pro­gres­sives urged her to em­brace crim­i­nal jus­tice re­forms as a district at­tor­ney and then the state’s at­tor­ney-gen­eral, Ms Har­ris op­posed them or stayed si­lent,” law pro­fes­sor Lara Bazelon wrote in The New York Times last year.</p>
    <p>Yet Ms Har­ris’ work was key to forg­ing a plat­form and pro­file from which she launched a suc­cess­ful Se­nate cam­paign in 2016, be­com­ing just the sec­ond black fe­male sen­a­tor ever.</p>
    <p>Her stint as at­tor­ney-gen­eral also helped her forge a con­nec­tion with Mr Bi­den’s son Beau, who held the same po­si­tion in the state of Delaware, and died of can­cer at the age of 46 in 2015.</p>
    <p>“I know how much Beau re­spected Ka­mala and her work, and that mat­tered a lot to me, to be hon­est with you, as I made this de­ci­sion,” Mr Bi­den said dur­ing his first ap­pear­ance with Ms Har­ris as run­ning mates.</p>
    <p>A vet­eran cam­paigner, Ms Har­ris oozes charisma but can quickly pivot from her megawatt smile to her pros­e­cu­to­rial per­sona of re­lent­less in­ter­ro­ga­tion and cut­ting re­torts.</p>
    <p>Clips went vi­ral of her sharp ques­tion­ing in 2017 of then At­tor­ney­Gen­eral Jeff Ses­sions dur­ing a Capi­tol Hill hear­ing on Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>“I’m not able to be rushed this fast! It makes me ner­vous,” an ex­as­per­ated Mr Ses­sions replied at one point.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris also clashed with Mr Bi­den dur­ing the first Demo­cratic de­bate, chid­ing the for­mer sen­a­tor over his op­po­si­tion to 1970s bus­ing pro­grammes that forced in­te­gra­tion of seg­re­gated schools.</p>
    <p>“There was a lit­tle girl in Cal­i­for­nia who was part of the sec­ond class to in­te­grate her pub­lic school, and she was bused to school ev­ery day,” she said. “And that lit­tle girl was me.”</p>
    <p>That clash did not stop him from pick­ing Ms Har­ris, who has brought that feisty en­ergy to Mr Bi­den’s care­fully stage-man­aged cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her only de­bate against Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, Ms Har­ris raised her hand as he tried to in­ter­rupt her.</p>
    <p>“Mr Vice-Pres­i­dent, I’m speak­ing. I’m speak­ing,” she said with a glare, si­lenc­ing Mr Pence.</p>
    <p>Within hours of the de­bate, Tshirts bear­ing her words were be­ing of­fered for sale on­line.</p>
