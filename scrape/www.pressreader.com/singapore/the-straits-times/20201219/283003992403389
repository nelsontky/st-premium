    <p>MIAMI • Lexi Thomp­son, try­ing to ex­tend her streak of LPGA sea­sons with at least one vic­tory to eight, fired a seven-un­der 65 on Thurs­day to head the LPGA sea­son fi­nale Tour Cham­pi­onship field.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can, who won the event in 2018, had a one-shot lead over Den­mark’s Nanna Ko­er­stz Mad­sen, who fired a bo­gey-free 66 at Tiburon Golf Club in Naples, Florida, to put her­self in the mix for a first LPGA ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Thomp­son, whose 14 LPGA ti­tles in­clude one Ma­jor, jump-started her round with birdies at the sec­ond, third and fourth holes, and added an­other brace at the sixth and sev­enth.</p>
    <p>She bounced back from a bo­gey at the par-four ninth with a birdie at the par-three 12th, be­fore end­ing with back-to-back birdies.</p>
    <p>“It was great just be­ing out here,” said the Florida na­tive, although Covid-19 re­stric­tions meant her usual group of fam­ily mem­bers could not at­tend the event.</p>
    <p>“It’s a lot dif­fer­ent,” said Thomp­son, whose brother, Cur­tis, was on her bag. “But we’re just happy to be play­ing this week and my brother and I had a lot of fun.”</p>
    <p>As in 2018, she is in search of her first win of the sea­son at Tiburon.</p>
    <p>Com­ing off a missed cut last week at the US Women’s Open, the world No. 11 said she was more fo­cused on im­prove­ments to her game than stretch­ing her streak of sea­sons with at least one vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“I was just over­all very happy with how I com­mit­ted to my shots,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been work­ing so hard on my game in gen­eral try­ing to im­prove on it, and it’s been kind of an upand-down roller coaster with an un­for­tu­nate week last week.”</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pion Kim Seiy­oung of South Korea was among a trio shar­ing third on 67 along­side Ger­many’s Caro­line Mas­son and Amer­i­can Me­gan Khang.</p>
    <p>World No. 2 Kim is com­ing off her first Ma­jor vic­tory at the women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship in Oc­to­ber, which was fol­lowed by a win at the in­au­gu­ral Pel­i­can Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 and com­pa­triot Ko Jin-young headed a group of six play­ers on 68, while for­mer topranked Park In-bee – who holds a slight edge over fel­low South Korean Kim in the Player of the Year race – opened with a 71.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Danielle Kang, who is also in the hunt for Player of the Year hon­ours af­ter back-to-back wins ear­lier this year, also carded a 71.</p>
    <p>Day 3: StarHub Ch204, to­mor­row, 2am</p>
