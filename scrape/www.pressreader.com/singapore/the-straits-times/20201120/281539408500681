    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) will be giv­ing out kits for peo­ple liv­ing in landed prop­erty to “mos­quito-proof” their homes.</p>
    <p>It said in a state­ment yesterday that this is be­cause “the to­pog­ra­phy of landed res­i­den­tial homes is more favourable for mos­quito breed­ing than pri­vate apart­ments and HDB flats”. Its of­fi­cers have found more mos­quito breed­ing and dengue cases in landed homes than apart­ments or flats.</p>
    <p>The kit com­prises an in­for­ma­tion book­let on com­mon mos­quito breed­ing places in landed homes; a piece of lar­vae killer (Bti dunk) for them to place in roof gut­ters, drains or wa­ter foun­tains; and vis­ual re­minders, in­clud­ing weath­er­proof stick­ers and fridge mag­nets.</p>
    <p>The agency said that of the 2,942 dengue clus­ters this year, 2,836, or 96 per cent, are no longer ac­tive.</p>
    <p>But it added that “the to­tal num­ber of dengue clus­ters re­ported is­land­wide re­mains high”.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 106 ac­tive clus­ters, with the largest at Opera Es­tate, where 121 peo­ple have been in­fected.</p>
    <p>Although the num­ber of weekly in­fec­tions has fallen to less than a fifth of the all-time high of 1,792 in­fec­tions in July, the NEA said the weekly num­ber of dengue cases – 355 last week – is still much higher than usual.</p>
    <p>It said: “This is wor­ry­ing, as we may en­ter next year with an atyp­i­cally high num­ber of dengue cases, po­ten­tially lead­ing to an­other dengue out­break next year.”</p>
    <p>The NEA wants peo­ple to help beat dengue by spray­ing in­sec­ti­cide in dark cor­ners of the house, ap­ply­ing in­sect re­pel­lent reg­u­larly, and wear­ing long-sleeved tops and long pants. They should also en­sure that their homes and sur­round­ings are free from stag­nant wa­ter.</p>
