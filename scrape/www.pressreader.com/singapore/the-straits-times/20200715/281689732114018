    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping con­grat­u­lated Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong on the re­sults of last week’s gen­eral elec­tion in a phone con­ver­sa­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the call, both lead­ers reaf­firmed the strong ties be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China as they mark the 30th an­niver­sary of the es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic re­la­tions this year, said Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>PM Lee and Pres­i­dent Xi dis­cussed ways to fa­cil­i­tate eco­nomic re­cov­ery amid the Covid-19 pan­demic by strength­en­ing cross-bor­der and sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity, as well as fi­nance, trade and in­vest­ment co­op­er­a­tion, MFA said.</p>
    <p>The lead­ers ex­pressed ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the mu­tual as­sis­tance and sup­port be­tween their coun­tries dur­ing the out­break, while wel­com­ing bi­lat­eral and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion to deal with the pub­lic health and so­cio-eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>China’s state broad­caster CCTV cited Pres­i­dent Xi as say­ing that re­la­tions stand at a “new start­ing point”, and should be marked in a dy­namic va­ri­ety of ways.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that through (PM Lee’s) lead­er­ship, Sin­ga­pore will be able to over­come the epi­demic very soon, and eco­nomic and so­cial vi­tal­ity will be re­stored,” CCTV re­ported Pres­i­dent Xi as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was among the first coun­tries to es­tab­lish a “fast track” pro­gramme with China, al­low­ing for quar­an­tine-free of­fi­cial and busi­ness travel be­tween both coun­tries with safe­guards dur­ing the pan­demic. In a bid to cap im­ported coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, Bei­jing has im­ple­mented strict travel re­stric­tions, which in­clude bar­ring most long-term visa hold­ers from en­ter­ing the coun­try, and lim­it­ing in­ter­na­tional flights to one a week.</p>
    <p>China and Sin­ga­pore should strengthen anti-epi­demic co­op­er­a­tion to en­sure the safety and health of their cit­i­zens and make good use of the “fast track” to speed up the re­sump­tion of work and pro­duc­tion in both coun­tries, help­ing to re­vive their economies, CCTV re­ported Mr Xi as say­ing.</p>
    <p>PM Lee and Pres­i­dent Xi also dis­cussed the con­tin­ued progress in key bi­lat­eral projects such as the China-Sin­ga­pore (Chongqing) Demon­stra­tion Ini­tia­tive on Strate­gic Con­nec­tiv­ity-New In­ter­na­tional Land-Sea Trade Cor­ri­dor, as well as co­op­er­a­tion un­der the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Both lead­ers ex­changed views on re­gional and in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ments too.</p>
    <p>PM Lee also con­veyed his con­do­lences on the on­go­ing floods in China, and ex­pressed con­fi­dence in China’s abil­ity to over­come this chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Amid some of the high­est rain­falls on record, parts of the Yangtze River have over­flowed, in­un­dat­ing much of the south and por­tions of cen­tral China.</p>
