    <p>Malaysian ty­coon Lim Kok Thay has pledged nearly his en­tire stake in em­bat­tled cruise op­er­a­tor Gent­ing Hong Kong as col­lat­eral for loans, rais­ing the risk of a mar­gin call af­ter the stock plunged on Thurs­day. The record sell-off came af­ter the com­pany said it sus­pended all pay­ments to cred­i­tors in a bid to main­tain its crit­i­cal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>• Malaysian ty­coon Lim Kok Thay has pledged nearly his en­tire stake in em­bat­tled cruise op­er­a­tor Gent­ing Hong Kong as col­lat­eral for loans, rais­ing the risk of a mar­gin call af­ter the stock plunged on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The record sell-off came af­ter the com­pany said it sus­pended all pay­ments to cred­i­tors in a bid to main­tain its crit­i­cal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>As of Thurs­day, the stock had lost al­most two-thirds of its value since</p>
    <p>De­cem­ber, and that is only part of Mr Lim’s sink­ing em­pire amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>His casino-to-hos­pi­tal­ity con­glom­er­ate Gent­ing and its units had their first-ever group­wide salary re­duc­tions ear­lier this year, and his Gent­ing Malaysia said in June it was cut­ting thou­sands of jobs.</p>
    <p>“The like­li­hood of other units be­ing asked to help out Gent­ing Hong Kong is low as each listed en­tity is closely reg­u­lated by its re­spec­tive reg­u­la­tor,” said Mr Tushar Mo­hata, head of re­search at No­mura Malaysia.</p>
    <p>But in­vestor con­cern about the ef­fects on other com­pa­nies in the group will re­main be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic and a his­tory of re­lated-party trans­ac­tions in the group, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim has been pledg­ing more of his hold­ings as the shares have plunged.</p>
    <p>Al­most all of his 76 per cent stake in Gent­ing Hong Kong is now com­mit­ted – or six bil­lion shares, ac­cord­ing to a stock ex­change fil­ing at the end of last month – up from 5.5 bil­lion shares in April.</p>
    <p>As of March, he had also pledged 550 mil­lion of his Gent­ing shares, or 32 per cent of his hold­ings, com­pared with 70 mil­lion a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to the com­pany’s an­nual re­ports.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing shares closed down 6.1 per cent to RM3.57 yes­ter­day. Malaysian mar­kets were shut for a hol­i­day on Thurs­day, when shares of Gent­ing Hong Kong plunged by a record 38 per cent. Gent­ing Hong Kong shares re­cov­ered some of their losses yes­ter­day, clos­ing up 5 per cent at 39 Hong Kong cents.</p>
    <p>Shares of Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore, which op­er­ates Re­sorts World Sen­tosa in Sin­ga­pore, closed up 0.5 cent, or 0.7 per cent, at 69.5 cents.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s own for­tune is now val­ued at about US$700 mil­lion (S$958.4 mil­lion) ex­clud­ing pledged shares, down from US$1.5 bil­lion at the be­gin­ning of the year, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Mel­binger, a</p>
    <p>Chicago-based part­ner at Win­ston & Strawn who spe­cialises in ex­ec­u­tive com­pen­sa­tion, said the case il­lus­trates ex­actly why com­pa­nies should limit share pledg­ing.</p>
    <p>“Many com­pa­nies hit a bump in the road, caus­ing a sud­den de­cline in stock price,” Mr Mel­binger said.</p>
    <p>“That hap­pens. How­ever, when this bump causes the most sig­nif­i­cant share­holder and di­rec­tor of the com­pany to have to sell shares, or a mar­gin call au­to­mat­i­cally trig­gers the sell­ing, the prob­lem be­comes much, much worse.”</p>
    <p>Pledg­ing shares is not un­usual, es­pe­cially in Asia, where high-growth com­pa­nies are more com­mon and ty­coons of­ten turn to lenders and other fi­nan­cial ser­vice firms that of­fer cash in ex­change for com­mit­ted stock.</p>
    <p>Tesla’s Mr Elon Musk, Soft­Bank Group’s Mr Masayoshi Son and Or­a­cle’s Mr Larry El­li­son have also re­lied on the prac­tice to get loans, which are typ­i­cally a frac­tion of the value of the pledge.</p>
    <p>But in times of hard­ship, pledg­ing can back­fire. Ex­ec­u­tives might have to in­crease col­lat­eral to meet banks’ mar­gin calls, and in some cases may even need to liq­ui­date their as­sets at de­pressed prices.</p>
    <p>The risk to the mar­ket, in turn, is that the forced sales pushes the stock even lower.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim has over­seen the Gent­ing em­pire since tak­ing over in 2003 from his fa­ther, who started the busi­ness as a hill re­sort in Malaysia in 1965.</p>
    <p>While the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has boosted many for­tunes from the tech­nol­ogy to pharma in­dus­tries, tourism and casino com­pa­nies have suf­fered amid lock­down mea­sures and travel curbs.</p>
    <p>UOB Kay Hian ex­pects Gent­ing Hong Kong to reach a prag­matic deal with cred­i­tors and get ad­di­tional fi­nanc­ing to stay afloat in the in­terim, an­a­lysts Vin­cent Khoo and Jack Goh wrote in a note.</p>
    <p>The cruise op­er­a­tor would even­tu­ally be able to is­sue new debt or eq­uity at high in­ter­est costs or sig­nif­i­cant dis­counts, they said.</p>
    <p>The cruise op­er­a­tor’s syn­di­cated debt in­cludes loans by Malayan Bank­ing, which dropped 1.2 per cent yes­ter­day, and RHB Bank, which slid 1.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Malaysia, which op­er­ates a casino and re­sort out­side of Kuala Lumpur, slumped as much as 6.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group sees low risk of Gent­ing group com­pa­nies bail­ing out the Hong Kong cruise firm, though there is “some rep­u­ta­tional dam­age”, ac­cord­ing to a note.</p>
