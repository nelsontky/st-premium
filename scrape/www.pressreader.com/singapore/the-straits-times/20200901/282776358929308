    <p>The Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore’s Art + Live se­ries of monthly on­line con­certs in­vites lo­cal per­form­ers to re­flect and re­spond to se­lected art pieces with pieces of mu­sic that have re­sounded with and moved them.</p>
    <p>Its lat­est guest was Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent vi­o­lin­ist Lynnette Seah, who re­tired as co-leader of the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>She had served the na­tional orches­tra for 41 years, from its in­au­gu­ral con­certs in 1979, and is a true pi­o­neer of the Sin­ga­pore pro­fes­sional mu­sic scene. Th­ese days, she has be­come renowned as a celebrity chef in fine-din­ing cir­cles.</p>
    <p>Like a well-cu­rated meal, her half-hour solo recital com­prised varied reper­toire works, served as tasty morsels on a sil­ver plat­ter.</p>
    <p>Xu Bei­hong’s 1927 Por­trait Of Lim Loh (a pi­o­neer ar­chi­tect and build­ing con­trac­tor in colo­nial Sin­ga­pore and fa­ther of anti-Ja­panese pa­triot Gen­eral Lim Bo Seng) was jux­ta­posed with the ear­li­est mu­sic on the pro­gramme, two move­ments from Johann Se­bas­tian Bach’s Un­ac­com­pa­nied Vi­o­lin Par­tita No. 3 In E Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>The swift and tech­ni­cally chal­leng­ing Pre­lu­dio re­vealed Seah’s tech­nique to be still close to im­pec­ca­ble on many fronts.</p>
    <p>This was con­trasted with the dou­ble-stop­ping (play­ing two notes at the same time) and singing tone in the more leisurely paced Loure. It seemed a pity that the pop­u­lar and jaunty Gavotte had not been in­cluded in this se­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Chua Mia Tee’s Road Con­struc­tion Worker (1955) was a sober­ing study of hard labour and re­silience. Wit­ness the ema­ci­ated fig­ure, dis­tended veins and with­er­ing gaze of its long-suf­fer­ing sub­ject.</p>
    <p>Seah likened this pathosin­duc­ing vis­age with the out­sized de­mands needed to master Fritz Kreisler’s Prae­ludium & Al­le­gro In The Style Of Pug­nani.</p>
    <p>She calmly ne­go­ti­ated the req­ui­site fault­less in­to­na­tion for the slow pre­lude and then stead­fastly with­stood the thorny parts of the fast sec­tion, which got in­creas­ingly hair-rais­ing as t he work pro­gressed.</p>
    <p>With the most out­wardly vir­tu­osic part of the pro­gramme over, Seah brought out her lyri­cal best for two en­core-like pieces, ar­guably the con­cert’s most touch­ing mo­ments.</p>
    <p>Th­ese were cho­sen as a re­flec­tion of the sub­ject of love in Chua’s 1957 por­trait of his late wife and fel­low artist Lee Boon Ngan.</p>
    <p>Although there was nei­ther pi­ano nor harp ac­com­pa­ni­ment to back her in Ed­ward El­gar’s Sa­lut D’Amour, her gor­geous tone was more than enough to sus­tain one’s in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing that, Jules Massenet’s Med­i­ta­tion from the opera Thais was de­liv­ered with a sim­i­lar kind of fris­son, demon­strat­ing how a sim­ple tune could carry such an im­pact when played with love and ded­i­ca­tion. Such is the mea­sure of a true artist.</p>
