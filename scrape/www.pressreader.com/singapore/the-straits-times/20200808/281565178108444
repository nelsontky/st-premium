    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal prob­lems can be viewed through eco­nomic lenses, as they in­volve scarcity of re­sources and com­pe­ti­tion. Ap­ply­ing eco­nomic tools yields some in­sights into how mar­ket mech­a­nisms and green ac­count­ing can be used to help save the planet, says Pro­fes­sor Eus­ton Quah.</p>
    <p>Although cli­mate change science is com­plex, the is­sue is less so.</p>
    <p>Hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties pro­duce car­bon emis­sions spew­ing into the at­mos­phere which, over time, ac­cu­mu­late and over­come the earth’s nat­u­ral sys­tem in clear­ing this, and lead to an in­crease in global tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Thus, there are mul­ti­lat­eral meet­ings with pres­sure from green lobby groups to con­trol the rise.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, there is much talk within coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore in­cluded, that we should sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce our de­pen­dency on fos­sil fu­els, play an im­pact­ful role in the mul­ti­lat­eral global meet­ings, use solar en­ergy, use pub­lic trans­port, re­cy­cle, and re­duce and reuse goods.</p>
    <p>Many of these sug­ges­tions are of­ten im­prac­ti­cal, with much of the talk rhetor­i­cal. Also, there is lit­tle Sin­ga­pore can do to in­flu­ence global tem­per­a­tures. Even if all car­bon emis­sions were to cease, it would re­move only 0.01 per cent of to­tal global emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Here are five strate­gies for Sin­ga­pore that pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment and yet al­low for con­tin­ued eco­nomic growth, though at a lower rate. They in­volve fo­cus­ing on what Sin­ga­pore could do in­ter­nally in terms of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment mea­sures, while tak­ing into ac­count its unique cir­cum­stances and con­straints.</p>
    <p>1 AL­LO­CAT­ING RE­SOURCES: HOW TO DE­CIDE?</p>
    <p>The use of cost-ben­e­fit anal­y­sis is cru­cial in mak­ing re­source al­lo­ca­tion decisions. Un­der­stand­ing clearly what are the gains and losses when we com­mit our scarce re­sources – whether it be money, time or ef­fort – to a project, pol­icy or pro­gramme en­sures that we fully com­pre­hend the con­cept of trade-offs.</p>
    <p>What is at stake, who gains and who loses, how do we man­age un­cer­tain­ties, and how to ac­count for time in terms of length of the project or pol­icy, will go a long way in mak­ing in­formed decisions.</p>
    <p>In de­cid­ing land al­lo­ca­tion decisions, for ex­am­ple, say be­tween keep­ing the land as vir­gin for­est or clear­ing it for de­vel­op­ment for res­i­den­tial hous­ing, one has to know the ben­e­fits of for­est cover, the value of trees, fauna and flora, and other amenity use in­clud­ing recre­ation. Then one must com­pare that with the costs of for­gone res­i­den­tial hous­ing ben­e­fits, in al­le­vi­at­ing space con­straints, in pro­mot­ing busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties as­so­ci­ated with the de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>All the itemised and pur­ported gains and losses are re­duced to mon­e­tary val­ues so that they can be com­pared eas­ily.</p>
    <p>All gains and losses must in­clude both mar­ket and non-mar­ket goods. A non-mar­ket good is one where there is presently no ex­ist­ing mar­ket price, like recre­ation, or trees pro­vid­ing car­bon cap­ture, and shade, or the his­tor­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance of the site.</p>
    <p>The value of such ser­vices must be es­ti­mated and val­ued. It is al­ways the series of steps re­quired in a cost-ben­e­fit anal­y­sis lead­ing to the fi­nal de­ci­sion that is im­por­tant, and not the fi­nal de­ci­sion it­self.</p>
    <p>The ref­er­ence point is so­ci­ety as a whole and not any smaller seg­ment of it that should be as­sessed.</p>
    <p>2 FIND­ING SO­CI­ETY’S PREF­ER­ENCES</p>
    <p>Em­bed­ded in these stud­ies must be se­ri­ous ef­forts to elicit so­ci­ety’s pref­er­ences. This is im­por­tant in mat­ters which im­pact liveli­hoods, health and the fu­ture. It helps to pri­ori­tise what peo­ple re­ally want.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments pro­vide all kinds of pub­lic goods and ser­vices. Roads, en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, ed­u­ca­tion, health, so­cial safety nets and se­cu­rity all de­mand re­sources. But be­cause of fi­nan­cial con­straints in par­tic­u­lar, it re­quires a judg­ment call and an un­der­stand­ing of pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Whose pri­or­i­ties should they en­tail? Should they be the purview of only the ex­perts, or should they be only a gov­ern­ment’s views, or en­com­pass as much in­for­ma­tion as pos­si­ble from all seg­ments of so­ci­ety, to ar­rive at an in­clu­sive and in­formed de­ci­sion?</p>
    <p>Use­ful ap­proaches to es­tab­lish so­ci­ety’s pref­er­ences amid com­pet­ing choices in­clude elic­it­ing peo­ple’s will­ing­ness to pay or ac­cept changes in risks; stated pref­er­ences meth­ods to see how peo­ple re­act to changes in a sta­tus quo; and peo­ple’s pref­er­ences for short-run ver­sus long-run con­sump­tion via choice of dis­count rates.</p>
    <p>3 PRIC­ING AND US­ING MAR­KET IN­STRU­MENTS</p>
    <p>Three ways to man­age the en­vi­ron­ment are: im­pos­ing reg­u­la­tions such as set­ting quo­tas and stan­dards for pol­lu­tion lev­els, traf­fic con­ges­tion and the like; hav­ing a gov­ern­ment di­rectly pro­duce the goods as in clean­ing up the wa­ter­ways to en­sure wa­ter qual­ity or pro­tect­ing a park; or through mar­ket in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket in­stru­ments work by es­tab­lish­ing a price on the use of the en­vi­ron­ment. The ap­proach in­cludes emis­sion and ef­flu­ent charges, prod­uct charges, and trad­able per­mits.</p>
    <p>Such in­stru­ments use in­cen­tives and dis­in­cen­tives to en­cour­age or dis­cour­age be­hav­iour. Com­pared with reg­u­la­tion or di­rect pro­duc­tion ap­proaches, they are more ef­fi­cient and ef­fec­tive, al­low­ing for greater flex­i­bil­ity and in­no­va­tion. Mar­ket in­stru­ments also pro­vide rev­enues for the state, such as in car­bon taxes, cer­tifi­cates of en­ti­tle­ment, wa­ter and elec­tric­ity charges, emis­sion taxes, and ef­flu­ent fees.</p>
    <p>The main rea­son for in­creased car­bon emis­sions is the lack of a price for car­bon us­age. As with all pol­lu­tion emis­sions and what econ­o­mists re­fer to as ex­ter­nal­i­ties – air, wa­ter, and even noise – which have no ready mar­ket prices, this will pre­dictably lead to en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion.</p>
    <p>So the third ac­tion Sin­ga­pore needs to con­sider is to price all goods, in­clud­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal goods, and al­low mar­ket forces to work.</p>
    <p>With prices, peo­ple will no longer over-con­sume the en­vi­ron­ment, since us­ing any en­vi­ron­men­tal goods is no longer free.</p>
    <p>They will ra­tion their con­sump­tion by their own val­u­a­tion of such goods.</p>
    <p>Car­bon tax is one way to price car­bon us­age, but more could be done to price noise, waste dis­posal, and land and ameni­ties when it comes to us­ing land for de­vel­op­ment. Any project pro­posal must in­cor­po­rate such costs on the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>4 ADAP­TA­TION</p>
    <p>IS KEY</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that in the case of cli­mate change, we will need both mit­i­ga­tion as in car­bon pric­ing and var­i­ous reg­u­la­tions and other meth­ods to re­duce global warm­ing. But this will take time and it will re­quire sig­nif­i­cant co­op­er­a­tion among coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, Sin­ga­pore must spare no ef­fort in in­vest­ing in adap­ta­tion meth­ods. Much has been done to con­trol flood­ing, strengthen and ex­pand sea walls, and en­sure wa­ter sup­plies are suf­fi­cient and di­ver­si­fied. But more could be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, this could in­clude iden­ti­fy­ing, in­cen­tivis­ing and in­ten­si­fy­ing re­search into trop­i­cal dis­eases and ill­nesses, cases of which are ex­pected to rise with a warmer world.</p>
    <p>Study­ing lower-in­come groups’ adapt­abil­ity to cli­mate change is an­other im­por­tant area. Be­cause of in­come in­equal­ity and lack of re­sources, this group would be less able to adapt and would re­quire more fo­cused poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Heat stress is yet an­other area where the poor will be most vul­ner­a­ble. 5 GREEN AC­COUNT­ING</p>
    <p>We need to think about con­struct­ing a sys­tem of mea­sur­ing the stock and use of en­vi­ron­men­tal re­sources. The tra­di­tional gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) mea­sure cap­tures only mar­ket trans­ac­tions, whereas in the case of the en­vi­ron­ment, mar­kets are ei­ther in­com­plete or don’t ex­ist.</p>
    <p>GDP does not show de­ple­tion of the stock of nat­u­ral re­sources, nor how a so­ci­ety val­ues changes in the en­vi­ron­ment on qual­ity of life.</p>
    <p>True, it is chal­leng­ing to build a green set of ac­counts as it en­tails the col­lec­tion of a good amount of data, and an agree­ment on mon­e­tary val­ues and the meth­ods to de­rive them. How­ever, it is im­por­tant for so­ci­ety to know in the course of eco­nomic growth what must be given up, and this, in turn, will pro­vide bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the trade-offs be­tween fur­ther growth, and re­duc­tion or degra­da­tion of en­vi­ron­men­tal re­sources.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing the first step of con­struct­ing a green ac­count sup­ple­ment­ing the coun­try’s GDP will be a start.</p>
    <p>THE WAY FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>We need to think glob­ally but act lo­cally. The five strate­gies will go a long way to­wards en­sur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>To the ex­tent that en­vi­ron­men­tal prob­lems and is­sues are largely eco­nomic prob­lems – as both share the same char­ac­ter­is­tics of scarcity of re­sources and com­pet­ing uses – we should use more eco­nomic tools and think­ing to bear on the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
