    <p>A young girl is trans­ported to the worlds of the four great clas­si­cal Chi­nese nov­els.</p>
    <p>She meets the famed mil­i­tary strate­gists Zhang Fei, Liu Bei and Guan Yu from The Ro­mance Of The Three King­doms, the star-crossed lovers Lin Daiyu and Jia Baoyu from Dream Of The Red Cham­ber, the tiger-fight­ing hero Wu Song from Wa­ter Mar­gin and the mis­chievous Mon­key King Sun Wukong from Jour­ney To The West.</p>
    <p>That was the premise of a Man­darin short story by Fu Xuan, a Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent from Nanyang Girls’ High School.</p>
    <p>She was one of 36 sec­ondary school stu­dents whose win­ning en­tries in a na­tional cre­ative writ­ing com­pe­ti­tion were se­lected for pub­li­ca­tion as part of a new set of sup­ple­men­tary read­ing ma­te­ri­als for sec­ondary school stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Sun Xuel­ing launched the col­lec­tion of eight books dur­ing a vir­tual prize pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­mony for the com­pe­ti­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The con­test, held last Au­gust, was jointly or­gan­ised by the Com­mit­tee to Pro­mote Chi­nese Lan­guage Learn­ing and the Sin­ga­pore Cen­tre for Chi­nese Lan­guage (SCCL).</p>
    <p>Con­tes­tants were re­quired to cre­ate a story based on pre­scribed top­ics.</p>
    <p>Fu Xuan, who won an ex­cel­lence award for her en­try, said her par­ents would read the four clas­si­cal nov­els to her as bed­time sto­ries when she was young, a chap­ter at a time.</p>
    <p>“Since I was young, writ­ing has al­ways been my pas­sion and my dream is to pub­lish a book in the fu­ture,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing my story pub­lished re­ally mo­ti­vates me greatly and inspires me to con­tinue writ­ing to achieve my goals one day.”</p>
    <p>The books will be dis­trib­uted free to all sec­ondary schools in Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion said</p>
    <p>each school will re­ceive 42 sets of the books to en­sure they have suf­fi­cient copies for use dur­ing lessons.</p>
    <p>The set will also be avail­able for pur­chase from SCCL by the end of next Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The SCCL has cat­e­gorised the sto­ries into four dif­fer­ent grades ac­cord­ing to the com­plex­ity of the lan­guage used, for stu­dents from Sec­ondary 1 to 4, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers can also rec­om­mend a dif­fer­ent grade for their stu­dents de­pend­ing on their lan­guage abil­ity, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Na­tional Li­brary Board has brought back its “Molly” mo­bile li­brary buses for the first time since such out­reach op­er­a­tions were sus­pended in Fe­bru­ary due to Covid-19. A Molly bus was at Lot One shop­ping mall in Choa Chu Kang yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Molly buses will be re­sum­ing their ser­vices at se­lected preschools and spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion schools on week­days, with safe dis­tanc­ing and tem­per­a­ture tak­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>On week­ends, pri­or­ity will be given to ex­ist­ing com­mu­nity part­ners who are serv­ing low-in­come es­tates that do not have a pub­lic li­brary within 2km of their lo­ca­tion.</p>
