    <p>Brace your­self for another year of tu­mult. Geopo­lit­i­cal shifts are on­go­ing be­tween one great in­cum­bent power and another emer­gent. The United States faces con­flict abroad as well as sharp di­vi­sions do­mes­ti­cally. Across our re­gion, coun­tries face pres­sures from both out­side and within, with many po­lit­i­cal and social di­vi­sions. The pan­demic adds to these pres­sures and ac­cel­er­ates a num­ber of trends.</p>
    <p>That sounds like to­day. But save for the pan­demic, it also de­scribes end-1970, 50 years ago. The geopo­lit­i­cal shift was from the Bri­tish, marked by the troop with­drawal from their last base in Sin­ga­pore in 1971. The new power, the US, was in­creas­ingly mired in the Viet­nam con­flict, with the anti-war op­po­si­tion move­ment grow­ing at home.</p>
    <p>Across the re­gion, many gov­ern­ments strug­gled with com­mu­nist move­ments and in­ter­nal di­vi­sions. The eco­nomic, social and devel­op­men­tal chal­lenges of “na­tion-build­ing” were also high pri­or­ity, es­pe­cially for the newly in­de­pen­dent coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>What echoes 50 years on? What has changed?</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, it is hum­bling how no one saw the pan­demic com­ing. Back in Jan­uary, pre­dic­tions were for a rel­a­tively good year. Even into end-Fe­bru­ary, few an­tic­i­pated the global-scale im­pacts. Some now turn to a longer arc of history in think­ing of what may be ahead, with analo­gies like the Great De­pres­sion and Cold War.</p>
    <p>For me, there are also per­sonal rea­sons. Towards the end of 1970, my late fa­ther Tay Seow Huah gave a talk at a sem­i­nar on “South-east Asia To­day”. He was then the di­rec­tor of the Se­cu­rity and In­tel­li­gence Divi­sion, re­port­ing to our first-gen­er­a­tion lead­ers on the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment. Re-read­ing his es­say, sim­i­lar­i­ties struck me, even as dif­fer­ences are no­table.</p>
    <p>History does not re­peat it­self, some say, but it of­ten rhymes.</p>
    <p>GREAT POWER SHIFTS AND SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>In 1971, the with­drawal of Bri­tish troops from Sin­ga­pore punc­tu­ated the end of Em­pire and a geopo­lit­i­cal shift. “To­day, Bri­tish power... is no longer the size as it was in the 50s dur­ing the Emer­gency,” my fa­ther re­marked mildly. “The in­volve­ment of out­side pow­ers can­not be ig­nored. The re­gion has from the ear­li­est times been sub­jected to out­side in­flu­ence and in­ter­ven­tion.”</p>
    <p>Many steps were needed to pre­pare for that change, and ur­gently, in­clud­ing the press­ing need to es­tab­lish an army, with the unortho­dox and low-key help of Is­raeli ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>As a child, I re­mem­ber many “Mex­i­cans” – as these ad­vis­ers were eu­phemisti­cally re­ferred to – com­ing around for din­ners and in­for­mal chats. I also re­call my fa­ther tak­ing us to Sele­tar to a small shack just out­side the Bri­tish camp that sold fish and chips said to be the clos­est and most au­then­tic ver­sion avail­able, and then later the flurry of in­ter­est in try­ing A&W, the then new Amer­i­can chain.</p>
    <p>In 1971, my fa­ther was sent to the US on a six-month Eisen­hower Fel­low­ship to get to know the coun­try better.</p>
    <p>With the Bri­tish de­part­ing, Sin­ga­pore stepped up ef­forts to en­gage the new su­per­power, with the then young Lee Kuan Yew build­ing a re­la­tion­ship that strength­ened from the Nixon ad­min­is­tra­tion to en­dure and grow over many decades.</p>
    <p>To­day, the con­ven­tional wis­dom is to look at the US as the guar­an­tor of se­cu­rity and sta­tus quo power. Yet doubts arose in the 1970s, as con­flict in Viet­nam deep­ened and in­ter­nal di­vi­sions sapped Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal will.</p>
    <p>My fa­ther took the view that “the pre­cise mag­ni­tude of the change in US pol­icy that will oc­cur is still not clear and would de­pend to a large ex­tent upon changes in US do­mes­tic at­ti­tudes”. Now again, we hear echoes of that as the US strug­gles with social and po­lit­i­cal fis­sures amid sug­ges­tions that it is a coun­try in de­cline. Global im­pacts can flow from Amer­ica’s do­mes­tic con­tes­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>THE CHINA QUES­TION</p>
    <p>Many to­day also look to China, emerg­ing ear­li­est and strong­est from the pan­demic. Back in 1970, China was watched mainly through the lens of Cold War con­cerns and its sup­port for com­mu­nism in our re­gion.</p>
    <p>My fa­ther wor­ried that China’s in­ten­tion was “to change the present sta­tus quo... which means essen­tially the re­moval of the Amer­i­can pres­ence and the evo­lu­tion of indige­nous regimes”. Not all in the re­gion would be swayed but the con­cern was that coun­tries would adopt, “at the min­i­mum, a China-lean­ing neu­tral­ity and there­fore per­mit a con­sid­er­able Pek­ing in­flu­ence in the en­tire area”.</p>
    <p>No one fore­saw the sur­prise of 1971, when US Pres­i­dent Richard Nixon an­nounced he would visit China. Fifty years on, the Sino-Amer­i­can re­la­tion­ship has never been more important to the world, and China’s in­flu­ence across the re­gion has grown dra­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Even with a new Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion com­ing into of­fice, the US is ex­pected to con­tinue to re­gard China as a strate­gic com­peti­tor and ri­val. Some be­lieve a new Cold War is at hand, in which coun­tries of our re­gion will again be pawns or – to re­use the im­agery of the 1970s – domi­noes. Oth­ers can hope for limited co­op­er­a­tion in ar­eas like cli­mate change and the global fight against the pan­demic. But no one cur­rently pre­dicts a bold step like that taken by Mr Nixon.</p>
    <p>The com­ing years may well be piv­otal, es­pe­cially given the un­even ef­fects of the pan­demic</p>
    <p>and if China ac­cel­er­ates in re­cov­ery, rel­a­tively.</p>
    <p>WHAT CAN WE DO?</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle Sin­ga­pore can do di­rectly about the largest geopo­lit­i­cal con­cerns. That was true in those ear­lier years, and re­mains true to­day. Yet pos­i­tive steps have been taken and more op­tions ex­ist, com­pared with the past.</p>
    <p>Ties with both the US and China have devel­oped broadly, deeply and pos­i­tively. With China, since the end of com­mu­nist in­sur­gen­cies and from Deng Xiaop­ing’s visit to Sin­ga­pore in 1978, the shift has been fun­da­men­tal – from mis­trust to broad ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion and partnershi­p. The slew of agree­ments be­tween the two coun­tries early this month would have been unimag­in­able in ear­lier decades.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has emerged as a key node in Asia of value to the great pow­ers and oth­ers across the global com­mu­nity. With the on­go­ing pan­demic, that can­not be taken for granted. Yet this role can be re­in­forced if we man­age the sit­u­a­tion well in­ter­nally and re­con­nect safely, but also as quickly and widely as pos­si­ble. The de­ci­sion of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum to hold its 2021 sum­mit here is just one ex­am­ple of what can be done.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions with neigh­bours, too, have im­proved dra­mat­i­cally. In 1970, Asean was still nascent with ten­sions among its five found­ing mem­bers – In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Sin­ga­pore and Thai­land – even as a Cold War line di­vided them from North Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>But whereas Viet­nam in 1970 was feared as an ex­pan­sion­ist power, it is to­day an in­vest­ment dar­ling. While Myan­mar in that era was un­der mil­i­tary rule and au­tar­kic, there is now democ­racy and open­ness to the world. Com­par­a­tively, while far from per­fect, cur­rent ef­forts to in­te­grate the Asean com­mu­nity cre­ate many eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties and of­fer more po­lit­i­cal bal­last and space amid great power ri­valry – some­what as the Non-Aligned Move­ment of the 1970s tried to do.</p>
    <p>To­day’s level of in­vest­ment and growth in the re­gion was un­fore­seen in 1970, when some pre­dicted the re­gion would Balka­nise. Ties with Ja­pan have also grown dra­mat­i­cally after anti-Ja­panese demon­stra­tions in the mid-1970s and, since the Fukuda Doc­trine of 1977, Tokyo has be­come per­haps the most con­sis­tent part­ner for South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at the de­vel­op­ing and of­ten newly de­colonised coun­tries of the re­gion 50 years ago, the con­cerns stemmed not only from the Cold War but also from in­ter­nal chal­lenges. My late fa­ther warned: “Many of the in­ter­nal prob­lems... will not lend them­selves to quick or easy so­lu­tions. The ef­fi­ciency of the ad­min­is­tra­tive ap­pa­ra­tus and the qual­ity of the lead­er­ship will con­tinue to be var­ied.”</p>
    <p>Many of those in­ter­nal chal­lenges con­tinue into the present. Indeed, they are fur­ther com­pli­cated by the pan­demic, with cit­i­zen de­mands es­ca­lat­ing for health­care, eco­nomic as­sis­tance and eq­uity.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges of the 1970s were not over­come by overnight sil­ver-bul­let so­lu­tions. The path for­ward was nei­ther sim­ple nor with­out bumps and set­backs. Key strate­gies may be use­fully re­called: Pre­par­ing for geopo­lit­i­cal shifts and en­gag­ing the ma­jor pow­ers; ex­pect­ing tu­mult in the re­gion with many gov­ern­ments pre­oc­cu­pied with na­tional is­sues, and yet find­ing ways to work to­gether; em­pha­sis­ing ef­fi­ciency of gov­ern­ment and qual­ity of lead­er­ship; in­creas­ing re­silience and pre­par­ing con­tin­gency plans for the un­ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The year ahead will not be the same as 1971, just as 2020 was not 1970. Analy­ses and pol­icy pre­scrip­tions will dif­fer from those that served a pi­o­neer­ing gen­er­a­tion. Yet, look­ing back at a 50-year arc of time and the dis­tance Sin­ga­pore has come, we may to­day bor­row wis­dom and take courage for the times ahead. Much has been faced and over­come, and can be again.</p>
