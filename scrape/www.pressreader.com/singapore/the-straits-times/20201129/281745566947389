    <p>LON­DON Euro­pean Union chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier re­sumed make-or-break Brexit talks with his Bri­tish coun­ter­part David Frost in Lon­don yes­ter­day with the clock tick­ing for a deal on fu­ture trad­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>It is the first time they have met face-to-face since Mr Barnier went into self-iso­la­tion after a mem­ber of his team caught the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>A fail­ure to reach an agree­ment would see Bri­tain and the EU trad­ing on World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion terms, with tar­iffs im­me­di­ately im­posed on goods trav­el­ling to and from the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has been largely trad­ing on the same terms with the EU since it of­fi­cially left the bloc in Jan­uary as part of a tran­si­tion deal that ex­pires at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>As it stands, it will leave Europe’s trade and Cus­toms area in five weeks’ time, with talks on a fol­lowon agree­ment stalled over fish­ing rights and fair trade rules. Each side says the onus is on the other to make a de­ci­sive move if a deal is to be reached.</p>
    <p>“We are not far from the take-itor-leave-it mo­ment,” Mr Barnier later told am­bas­sadors from mem­ber states, ac­cord­ing to a Euro­pean source with knowl­edge of the closed-door meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has said there are “sub­stan­tial and im­por­tant dif­fer­ences to be bridged”.</p>
    <p>“The like­li­hood of a deal is very much de­ter­mined by our friends and part­ners in the EU. There’s a deal there to be done if they want to,” he said in a pooled tele­vi­sion in­ter­view on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Keir Starmer, the leader of Bri­tain’s op­po­si­tion Labour Party, said he could sup­port a Brexit deal if last-minute ne­go­ti­a­tions suc­ceed in the next few days, The Guardian news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>An ac­cord could yet be reached as soon as this week, ac­cord­ing to three EU of­fi­cials – but they cau­tioned that the bloc is still to be fully con­vinced that Mr John­son is ready to sign on to any agree­ment.</p>
    <p>In a pri­vate meet­ing with EU diplo­mats on Fri­day, Mr Barnier com­plained that Bri­tain’s in­sis­tence on an­nual ne­go­ti­a­tions over fish­ing quo­tas – some­thing the EU re­jects – was down to the govern­ment in Lon­don see­ing the is­sue as a mat­ter of sovereignt­y. The point was later un­der­scored by Mr Frost.</p>
    <p>“It is late, but a deal is still pos­si­ble, and I will con­tinue to talk un­til it’s clear that it isn’t,” Mr Frost tweeted. “But for a deal to be pos­si­ble, it must fully re­spect UK sovereignt­y. That is not just a word – it has prac­ti­cal con­se­quences.”</p>
    <p>Mr Barnier told the diplo­mats he is not par­tic­u­larly op­ti­mistic about se­cur­ing a deal – but he will con­tinue to try for a few more days, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cials with knowl­edge of the dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Un­less Bri­tain takes the nec­es­sary de­ci­sions quickly, he warned, reach­ing an ac­cord will be all but im­pos­si­ble, one EU diplo­mat briefed on the meet­ing said.</p>
    <p>Con­cern over a no-deal sce­nario is par­tic­u­larly acute on the bor­der be­tween EU mem­ber Ire­land and the Bri­tish prov­ince of North­ern Ire­land, where the sud­den im­po­si­tion of a hard bor­der threat­ens the del­i­cate peace se­cured by the 1999 Good Fri­day Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>On the is­sue of fish­ing, Ire­land’s RTE re­ported that Mr Barnier will make a new of­fer, ac­cept­ing a 15 per cent to 18 per cent cut in the EU’s share of the catch in Bri­tish wa­ters. But of­fi­cials on both sides said this fig­ure had been dis­cussed more than a month ago and Bri­tain had al­ready re­jected it.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is still seek­ing a “sig­nif­i­cant” in­crease in the amount of fish it is al­lowed to catch in its do­mes­tic wa­ters.</p>
    <p>Un­der EU rules, the UK is al­lo­cated less than a third of the quota. One EU of­fi­cial sug­gested that Bri­tain wants to in­crease that to 80 per cent – a sug­ges­tion peo­ple close to the ne­go­ti­a­tions said was way off the mark.</p>
    <p>With the out­come of the talks still un­cer­tain, Scot­land’s First Min­is­ter Ni­cola Stur­geon yes­ter­day said she had “never been more cer­tain” of achiev­ing in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>The leader of the pro-in­de­pen­dence Scot­tish Na­tional Party (SNP) told sup­port­ers at the party’s vir­tual con­fer­ence: “In­de­pen­dence is in clear sight – and with unity of pur­pose, hu­mil­ity and hard work I have never been so cer­tain that we will de­liver it.”</p>
    <p>The SNP has ar­gued for a sec­ond ref­er­en­dum on Scot­tish in­de­pen­dence since its over­whelm­ing vic­tory among Scot­tish seats in the 2019 Bri­tish elec­tion.</p>
