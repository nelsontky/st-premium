    <p>The next six months could wit­ness one of the big­gest con­sol­i­da­tions of cor­po­rate power in the United States in al­most a cen­tury, yet a va­ri­ety of le­gal and eco­nomic fac­tors may leave the fed­eral govern­ment un­able to stop it.</p>
    <p>The essence of the prob­lem is that dur­ing the ex­tended eco­nomic cri­sis cre­ated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, many large com­pa­nies – and es­pe­cially their stock market val­ues – have been grow­ing rapidly while their small-busi­ness com­peti­tors have faced some­thing of an apoca­lypse. More than 400,000 small busi­nesses have al­ready closed, and mil­lions more are at risk.</p>
    <p>Con­cen­tra­tion of power in a small num­ber of big com­pa­nies is not, it­self, new. Cor­po­rate con­cen­tra­tion has grown sig­nif­i­cantly in re­cent years, bring­ing with it in­creased cor­po­rate prof­its and a fall­ing share of in­come go­ing to work­ers, re­searchers have shown. In ad­di­tion, cor­po­rate cap­i­tal in­vest­ment has slowed, and so has the rate of new busi­ness for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists Colleen Cun­ning­ham of the Lon­don Busi­ness School and Flo­rian Ederer and Song Ma of Yale have shown that big­ger firms en­gage in “killer ac­qui­si­tions”, buy­ing in­no­va­tive com­peti­tors to pre­vent them from be­com­ing ma­jor threats.</p>
    <p>What is un­usual at this mo­ment is the ex­treme di­ver­gence in the health of dif­fer­ent types of com­pa­nies: Many of the big­gest are flush with money, while smaller com­peti­tors have never been in more pre­car­i­ous shape.</p>
    <p>What is needed to pre­vent rich com­pa­nies from en­gag­ing in a mass gob­bling up of small com­peti­tors is for the govern­ment antitrust au­thor­i­ties to be­come more mus­cu­lar. On the sur­face, this seems easy to ac­com­plish. Af­ter all, ei­ther the United States Jus­tice Depart­ment or the US Fed­eral Trade Com­mis­sion (FTC) must pass a judg­ment that any merger will not re­duce com­pe­ti­tion for it to go through.</p>
    <p>But three things make it hard to en­vi­sion the au­thor­i­ties pur­su­ing a “get tough” strat­egy at this crit­i­cal mo­ment.</p>
    <p>First, the en­force­ment bud­get for antitrust ac­tions was al­ready stretched way too thin even be­fore the cur­rent cri­sis be­gan. That bud­get has been fall­ing for years and is lower now than it was two decades ago. The en­tire antitrust di­vi­sion of the Jus­tice Depart­ment and the FTC are be­ing forced to op­er­ate on less than a sin­gle com­pany like Face­book brings in over a few days.</p>
    <p>In the past 10 years, the num­ber of merger fil­ings, which no­tify the au­thor­i­ties of an in­tended merger, has al­most dou­bled, but the num­ber of en­force­ment ac­tions taken by the govern­ment has ac­tu­ally fallen.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, there is an ex­plicit carve­out in the merger guide­lines for what is known as the “fail­ing firm de­fence”. It says, ef­fec­tively, that a merger will not cre­ate more market power (and so can be al­lowed) if the tar­get was go­ing to die any­way. Un­less Congress ap­proves fur­ther re­lief money for small busi­nesses, many of them will die; the num­ber of com­pa­nies that might fail with­out a merger is, ef­fec­tively, un­lim­ited. That short-run com­pli­ca­tion threat­ens to open the door to a buy­ing spree.</p>
    <p>In the last re­ces­sion, economist Carl Shapiro of the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley – at the time serv­ing as deputy as­sis­tant at­tor­ney­gen­eral in the antitrust di­vi­sion – said that in making antitrust as­sess­ments, the govern­ment needed to dis­tin­guish be­tween tem­po­rary fi­nan­cial dis­tress and long-term non-vi­a­bil­ity. It will be crit­i­cal to re­in­state that dis­tinc­tion now.</p>
    <p>Third, the fed­eral antitrust record dur­ing crises is not reassuring. As Univer­sity of Michi­gan law professor Daniel Crane put it in his history of antitrust en­force­ment: “In the al­most 120-year history of the Sher­man Act, no po­lit­i­cal ad­min­is­tra­tion has re­acted to a cri­sis by call­ing for more vig­or­ous en­force­ment of the antitrust laws.</p>
    <p>“To the con­trary, ad­min­is­tra­tions of both par­ties have re­sponded to crises – both mar­tial and eco­nomic – by ex­plic­itly or im­plic­itly pulling back on antitrust en­force­ment. In­dus­tri­al­ists have used crises as op­por­tu­ni­ties to deepen their grip on mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>The cri­sis that led to the tele­coms col­lapse of the early 2000s ush­ered in a huge con­sol­i­da­tion of the tele­coms in­dus­try that has left us with gi­ants like AT&T and Ver­i­zon. The fi­nan­cial cri­sis of a decade or so ago com­menced a wave of con­sol­i­da­tion in the bank­ing sec­tor.</p>
