    <p>In ar­chi­tec­ture, the tri­an­gle is usu­ally the favoured shape when it comes to the steel work of bridges and build­ings, ow­ing to the three-sided poly­gon’s char­ac­ter­is­tics that give it strength. It is quite im­pos­si­ble to col­lapse a tri­an­gle without break­ing one of its sides.</p>
    <p>In geopo­lit­i­cal analy­ses of North-east Asia, the tri­an­gle comes into play, too.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can power is said to rest on an Iron Tri­an­gle built on its al­liances with South Korea and Ja­pan, form­ing the ba­sis of a se­cu­rity in­fra­struc­ture that has, for years, kept an in­creas­ingly as­sertive China at bay and de­terred a hos­tile, nu­clear-armed North Korea.</p>
    <p>Un­til Mr Don­ald Trump came along, that is.</p>
    <p>In just four years, the out­go­ing US leader’s “Amer­ica First” pol­icy has dam­aged both al­liances and un­der­mined mu­tual trust with his threat to with­draw US troops and de­mand for five­fold in­creases in de­fence cost shar­ing. He also pres­sured both al­lies to re­duce their trade sur­plus with the United States, and con­doned short-range mis­sile provo­ca­tions by Py­ongyang that put both al­lies at risk.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion also turned a blind eye to the spat be­tween Seoul and Tokyo over wartime forced labour, which es­ca­lated into a full-fledged trade war that nearly caused an in­tel­li­gence-shar­ing pact be­tween them to be scrapped in 2019, sink­ing their bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>The South Korean leg of the Iron Tri­an­gle was al­ready shaky, as Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in had cosied up to Bei­jing to strengthen both coun­tries’ “strate­gic co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship” – first to ap­pease Chi­nese anger over the 2016 de­ploy­ment of a US mis­sile shield on South Korean soil, then to win</p>
    <p>Chi­nese sup­port for en­gag­ing North Korea in 2018.</p>
    <p>TIME FOR RE­SET</p>
    <p>Amid the chaos of Mr Trump’s for­eign pol­icy and South Korea’s do­mes­tic strat­egy, ques­tions have been raised about the South Korean leg of the Iron Tri­an­gle.</p>
    <p>With the in­com­ing Joe Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion that is in­tent on re­build­ing coali­tions and al­liances, the dy­nam­ics that un­der­pin this tri­an­gle will un­dergo changes again.</p>
    <p>It is timely and crit­i­cal for Mr Bi­den to re­set and shore up al­liances with South Korea and Ja­pan when he takes of­fice on Jan 20, as part of an over­all mis­sion to mount a stronger push­back against China’s grow­ing might.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would have to re­assess the sta­tus of Amer­i­can ties with South Korea as well as re­cal­i­brate the US’ over­all strat­egy to­wards North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim, who has been silent so far on the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion re­sults, may fi­nally dis­close his pol­icy stance on the US and South Korea dur­ing a party congress slated for this month. What­ever he de­mands will not change Mr Moon’s strong de­sire to im­prove in­ter-Korea ties, but it will take time for the lead­ers of the US and North Korea to build trust first be­fore any dis­cus­sion of di­a­logue re­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Asian pol­i­tics ex­pert Sean King from Wash­ing­ton-based con­sult­ing firm Park Strate­gies said that four years of “Amer­ica First” have given many coun­tries in the re­gion an un­set­tling glimpse of what an Asia without much US in­ter­fer­ence could look like.</p>
    <p>“Some friends and al­lies – scarred for life and now doubt­ing Amer­ica, no mat­ter what re­as­sur­ances they get from Bi­den – might think now’s the time to cut deals with Bei­jing while they still can,” he said. “Wash­ing­ton can try show­ing a way for­ward... First and fore­most, we can stop ex­tort­ing Seoul and Tokyo over de­fence costs and count our lucky stars that we can at least for­ward-de­ploy troops in each coun­try.”</p>
    <p>With Mr Bi­den in the White House, the dead­lock over de­fence cost shar­ing with South Korea is ex­pected to be re­solved quickly.</p>
    <p>But it re­mains to be seen if mas­sive joint mil­i­tary ex­er­cises, de­nounced by North Korea as prepa­ra­tions for war, will be re­in­stated af­ter be­ing can­celled by Mr Trump from 2018, as it de­pends on how far the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion wants to go in push­ing the regime’s but­tons. Only small-scale drills to main­tain com­bat readi­ness have been con­ducted since.</p>
    <p>Given a stronger em­pha­sis on al­liances, South Korea is likely to face US pres­sure to sup­port Amer­ica’s Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy and Quad Plus – a coali­tion of the US, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia – both aimed at con­tain­ing China.</p>
    <p>Seoul had been reluc­tant to par­tic­i­pate, fear­ing a back­lash from Bei­jing that could snow­ball into an­other round of eco­nomic re­tal­i­a­tions. The 2016 dis­pute over the de­ploy­ment of the mis­sile shield known as Ter­mi­nal High Alti­tude Area De­fence (Thaad) alone had cost South Korea about US$15.6 bil­lion (S$20.6 bil­lion) in tourism rev­enue. And Seoul is still wait­ing for a visit by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to for­mally end the long-sim­mer­ing row.</p>
    <p>WALK­ING ON A TIGHTROPE</p>
    <p>South Korea has for years trod­den on a tightrope be­tween the two giants, stuck in a dilemma and un­able to choose sides. In­stead, it tries to seek au­ton­omy from the US to deal with China, its largest trade part­ner, and flex­i­bil­ity to en­gage North Korea on its own.</p>
    <p>For its own na­tional se­cu­rity, South Korea knows it has to rely on the US nu­clear um­brella and the 28,500 US troops sta­tioned in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>But with Sino-US ri­valry set to con­tinue un­der a Bi­den era, whether over mil­i­tary might, tech­nol­ogy prow­ess or trade is­sues, chances are that Bei­jing will come knock­ing to woo Seoul away from Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi’s visit to Seoul last Novem­ber, timed af­ter Mr Bi­den’s elec­tion, sent a clear mes­sage that China ex­pects South Korea to shou wang xiang zhu – a Chi­nese id­iom that means to help one an­other out and de­fend against a com­mon en­emy.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang also dan­gled prospects of Mr Xi’s visit to Seoul, which could see the Chi­nese Pres­i­dent try­ing to “coax Moon to dis­tance from Wash­ing­ton in ex­change for eco­nomic and trade in­cen­tives”, said Dr Lee Seong-hyon of the Se­jong In­sti­tute think-tank.</p>
    <p>The visit was orig­i­nally sched­uled for last year but was post­poned due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. No date has been set yet.</p>
    <p>Dr Gra­ham Ong-Webb, ad­junct fel­low at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Sin­ga­pore, said: “Un­der the cur­rent Moon ad­min­is­tra­tion, Seoul is in­deed stuck be­tween the United States and China, fol­low­ing in what­ever di­rec­tion the tide is pulling.”</p>
    <p>But if one day, China’s grow­ing mil­i­tary power sur­passes the US’, it is “en­tirely pos­si­ble for a fu­ture South Korean ad­min­is­tra­tion to take refuge un­der Chi­nese se­cu­rity guar­an­tees that mit­i­gate North Korea as a threat”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr King of Park Strate­gies, how­ever, urged Seoul to re­mem­ber that “it’s Bei­jing’s back­stop­ping and en­abling of Py­ongyang that keeps Korea di­vided”, and that “it’s Bei­jing that pun­ishes South Kore­ans for act­ing in their own na­tional se­cu­rity in­ter­ests”, as seen in the Thaad dis­pute.</p>
    <p>If pub­lic sen­ti­ments are any gauge, a re­cent poll by Wash­ing­ton-based Pew Re­search Cen­tre showed that 75 per cent of South Kore­ans have un­favourable views on China, and 83 per cent of them have no con­fi­dence that Mr Xi will do the right thing re­gard­ing world af­fairs.</p>
    <p>The irony is this: Many in South Korea’s rul­ing lib­eral camp are sus­cep­ti­ble to Chi­nese woo­ing as they be­lieve China’s role is cru­cial to their grandiose dream of a uni­fied Korean penin­sula. But to win votes, such as in the April by-elec­tions for may­or­ship of Seoul and Bu­san, politi­cians must dis­tance them­selves from China and align closer to the US – the more favoured world leader among South Kore­ans.</p>
    <p>As tough as it is, South Korea will need to wisely man­age ties with both the US and China, choose a strat­egy that max­imises ben­e­fits from both sides while avoid­ing overde­pen­dence, and court both sides to re­solve the North Korea nu­clear is­sue.</p>
    <p>MOON’S CAL­CU­LA­TIONS</p>
    <p>Time is not on Mr Moon’s side, though. With just 16 months left in his term, there is ur­gency for the South Korean leader, who has met Mr Kim three times, to turn his en­gage­ment pol­icy to­wards the North into a le­gacy.</p>
    <p>Hop­ing to re­vive nu­clear talks, Mr Moon is now eye­ing the up­com­ing Tokyo Olympics as a plat­form to reach out to the North. If ties be­tween South Korea and Ja­pan could be im­proved, Seoul could, per­haps, nudge Tokyo to in­vite North Korea to the Games. And from there, it is hoped that di­a­logue would flow – just like what hap­pened at the Pyeongchan­g Win­ter Olympics held in South Korea in 2018.</p>
    <p>That event marked the warm­ing of in­ter-Korea ties that even­tu­ally led to sum­mit diplo­macy bro­kered by Mr Moon, most not­edly the 2018 Trump-Kim sum­mit in Sin­ga­pore which yielded an agree­ment to work to­wards com­plete de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion, even though crit­ics panned the event as mere the­atrics.</p>
    <p>How­ever, di­a­logue has stalled since the sec­ond round of Trump-Kim talks broke down in Hanoi in 2019, and Py­ongyang now in­sists that talks would be un­nec­es­sary un­less the US changes its stance.</p>
    <p>With Mr Trump’s up­com­ing exit, though, Mr Kim would lose di­rect com­mu­ni­ca­tions with US lead­er­ship and may have to rely on Seoul to reach out to Wash­ing­ton. This could give Mr Moon one last shot at en­gage­ment be­fore elec­tion frenzy kicks in later this year.</p>
    <p>Though bogged down by do­mes­tic strug­gles in­clud­ing a third Covid-19 wave, a crum­bling econ­omy and a record-high dis­ap­proval rat­ing of 59.7 per cent, Mr Moon is driven by a sense of mis­sion to seek rap­proche­ment with the North un­til the end.</p>
    <p>One ob­sta­cle that might stand in the way for him is that Mr Kim may not want his in­volve­ment, as two years of talks, Dr Ong-Webb noted, have left him in “al­most ir­repara­ble dis­ap­point­ment, frus­tra­tion and dis­trust with Seoul and Wash­ing­ton”.</p>
    <p>“In my as­sess­ment, even the Moon ad­min­is­tra­tion has demon­strated that it can­not read Mr Kim and his regime,” he said. “The ra­tio­nal and counter-in­tu­itive thing for the Moon ad­min­is­tra­tion to do is to stay on the side­lines... Any in­ter­ces­sion is likely to do harm than good.”</p>
    <p>Se­jong In­sti­tute’s Dr Lee also warned Seoul against mak­ing “any dra­matic move on North Korea” now, as it is likely to be in­ter­preted as be­ing driven by do­mes­tic pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>There is also a chance that North Korea would be too fo­cused on the Covid-19 out­break to pay any at­ten­tion to the Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>South Korea has for years trod­den on a tightrope be­tween the two giants, stuck in a dilemma and un­able to choose sides. In­stead, it tries to seek au­ton­omy from the US to deal with China, its largest trade part­ner, and flex­i­bil­ity to en­gage North Korea on its own. For its own na­tional se­cu­rity, South Korea knows it has to rely on the US nu­clear um­brella and the 28,500 US troops sta­tioned in the coun­try. But with Sino-US ri­valry set to con­tinue un­der a Bi­den era, whether over mil­i­tary might, tech­nol­ogy prow­ess or trade is­sues, chances are that Bei­jing will come knock­ing to woo Seoul away from Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>BET­TER TIES WITH TOKYO</p>
    <p>South Korea’s re­la­tion­ship with Ja­pan, al­though rocky due to historical dis­putes, is also an im­por­tant part in de­ter­min­ing the strength of the Iron Tri­an­gle.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon has al­ready struck a con­cil­ia­tory tone to­wards new Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga and is keen to ex­tend more olive branches.</p>
    <p>Ewha Wo­mans Univer­sity’s as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional stud­ies Leif-Eric Easley said the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would likely ex­ert pres­sure on both Seoul and Tokyo to re­solve historical rows. Mean­while, Ja­pan’s PM Suga would re­quire some progress in the wartime forced labour dis­pute to jus­tify a visit to Seoul to at­tend a tri­lat­eral sum­mit with China that South Korea is slated to host.</p>
    <p>“It would thus be shrewd of the South Korean gov­ern­ment to es­tab­lish a do­mes­tic fund for wartime labour­ers be­fore its courts liq­ui­date cor­po­rate as­sets and Ja­pan re­tal­i­ates, and be­fore Wash­ing­ton bangs heads to­gether to pri­ori­tise strate­gic con­cerns,” said Prof Easley.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s four years in of­fice have changed many things, in­clud­ing the dy­nam­ics of the US’ al­liance with South Korea and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>In the process of get­ting the tri­an­gle back to equi­lib­rium, the big­gest stress will fall on Mr Moon as he musters a last push to achieve his goals be­fore his term ends in May next year.</p>
    <p>As it is, South Korea is viewed by China as the weak link in the al­liance and most vul­ner­a­ble to its moves to in­crease Chi­nese in­flu­ence on the Korean penin­sula.</p>
