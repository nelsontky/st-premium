    <p>Pan­dora, known for its charm bracelets, rings and neck­laces, was started in 1982 and has a mar­ket value of about</p>
    <p>47.5 bil­lion Dan­ish kro­ner (S$10.3 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>LON­DON In a year of lock­downs and fall­ing con­sumer spend­ing, the top spot in the world’s best-per­form­ing national mar­ket has been taken, sur­pris­ingly, by a Dan­ish jew­ellery maker and re­tailer.</p>
    <p>Shares of Pan­dora have jumped 64 per cent this year, head­ing the OMX Copen­hagen 20 and 25, which lead coun­try in­dexes glob­ally in the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The ad­vance comes as short in­ter­est in the stock, which was the most tar­geted in the Stoxx 600 Per­sonal & House­hold Goods In­dex be­fore the pan­demic, dropped to less than 2 per cent of shares out­stand­ing, from about 12 per cent in Fe­bru­ary, ac­cord­ing to data by IHS Markit.</p>
    <p>“Hedge funds started l eav­ing when Pan­dora showed signs that growth was com­ing back and it has had a ketchup-bot­tle ef­fect on the stock,” said an­a­lyst Per Fogh of Sy­d­bank. “The short sell­ers have been out clos­ing their po­si­tions and com­bined with the pos­i­tive sen­ti­ment on growth, that has given the stock a big boost.”</p>
    <p>Viking Global In­vestors and WorldQuant are among hedge funds that have re­duced their short po­si­tions in Pan­dora to be­low the 0.5 per cent re­port­ing thresh­old, ac­cord­ing to fil­ings to the Dan­ish Fi­nan­cial Su­per­vi­sory Author­ity.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials at both funds did not re­spond to e-mailed re­quests for com­ment, while Pan­dora de­clined to com­ment on its share price.</p>
    <p>Pan­dora has not been im­mune to the pan­demic’s im­pact on sales, but in­vestors have be­come more op­ti­mistic on the brand’s re­cov­ery prospects, which started to gain trac­tion be­fore lock­downs be­gan.</p>
    <p>The com­pany sold shares ear­lier this year to shore up its bal­ance sheet, with Dan­ish state-con­trolled fund ATP snap­ping up stock in the pri­vate place­ment.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany has been through a turnaround process and be­fore the global lock­downs set in, we saw clear signs that the ef­forts are work­ing,” said Mr Claus Wi­in­blad, head of equities at ATP, which holds a 3.1 per cent stake in the jew­ellery maker. “The com­pany was trans­par­ent about the var­i­ous sce­nar­ios it might face and set up a plan that would en­sure suf­fi­cient liq­uid­ity even if the pan­demic de­vel­oped in the most neg­a­tive way.”</p>
    <p>Pan­dora, known for its charm bracelets, rings and neck­laces, was started in 1982 and has a mar­ket value of about 47.5 bil­lion Dan­ish kro­ner (S$10.3 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Alexan­der</p>
    <p>Lacik joined last year fol­low­ing a string of de­par­tures from the top man­age­ment. Since then, the brand has been re­launched, with the com­pany fore­cast­ing Ebit mar­gin to be in a range of 16 per cent to 19 per cent this year com­pared with al­most 27 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts are also look­ing past the jew­ellery maker’s pre­dic­tion for or­ganic sales to fall as much as 20 per cent this year, fo­cus­ing in­stead on the year ahead.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group has con­fi­dence in a ma­te­rial im­prove­ment in like-for-like sales from next year, and ef­forts on cost con­trol, an­a­lyst Silky Agar­wal wrote in a note this month that up­graded the stock to “buy”.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts cov­er­ing Pan­dora have had a mixed record pre­dict­ing the wild stock mar­ket swings of the jew­ellery maker. Most an­a­lysts got it wrong in 2018 when the shares lost al­most two-thirds of their value, with 16 out of 19 an­a­lysts hav­ing rec­om­mended buy­ing the equities at the start of that year.</p>
    <p>This year, they have re­mained wary, with only five an­a­lysts tracked by Bloomberg rat­ing the stock a “buy” or equiv­a­lent. Ten an­a­lysts rec­om­mend hold­ing the stock, while four have a “sell” rat­ing.</p>
    <p>The cau­tion is also re­flected in the av­er­age 12-month price tar­get</p>
    <p>of 415 kro­ner, which sug­gests shares fall­ing 13 per cent from the last price, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg. There are also chal­lenges ahead.</p>
    <p>Next year and 2022 will be hurt by high gold and sil­ver prices, with de­creases to earn­ings es­ti­mates po­ten­tially driv­ing share price weak­ness in the near term, RBC an­a­lyst Pi­ral Dad­ha­nia wrote last month.</p>
