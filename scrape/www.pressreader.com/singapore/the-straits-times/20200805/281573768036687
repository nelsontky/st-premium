    <p>A new e-com­merce plat­form of­fer­ing pro­mo­tional codes and dis­counts for var­i­ous brands and eater­ies has been launched by Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH). The Shop For Good on­line plat­form aims to help busi­nesses and con­sumers stim­u­late the econ­omy, SPH said re­cently.</p>
    <p>A new e-com­merce plat­form of­fer­ing shop­pers pro­mo­tional codes and dis­counts for their favourite brands and eater­ies has been launched by Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings (SPH).</p>
    <p>The Shop For Good (www.shop for­good.sph.com.sg) on­line plat­form aims to help busi­nesses and con­sumers stim­u­late the econ­omy, SPH said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides list­ings of pro­mo­tional codes and dis­count vouch­ers from food and bev­er­age (F&B), re­tail and life­style mer­chants to con­sumers.</p>
    <p>SPH deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive An­thony Tan said: “We hope to rally our read­ers to help lo­cal busi­nesses tide over these dif­fi­cult times. SPH is happy to use our net­work, through Shop For Good, as a cat­a­lyst for our re­tail and ser­vice sec­tors to re­gain mo­men­tum.”</p>
    <p>One of the eater­ies found on the site is Fill A Pita. The Mid­dle Eastern veg­e­tar­ian restau­rant in the Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict has taken a 90 per cent to 95 per cent hit to its lunch dine-in earn­ings af­ter more peo­ple started work­ing from home amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Its di­rec­tor Ibrahim Khater said: “As we’re all go­ing through a dif­fi­cult time, we are par­tic­i­pat­ing in Shop For Good to of­fer our cus­tomers great value deals to al­low them to dine at their favourite restau­rants at a bet­ter price.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We share the same vi­sion of think­ing of the cus­tomer first.”</p>
    <p>Apart from Fill A Pita, eater­ies such as An­glo In­dian Cafe & Bar and BTM Mus­sels & Bar, re­tail brands in­clud­ing Cath Kid­ston, Pe­dro and Dorothy Perkins, as well as life­style mer­chants Ning Foot & Back Spa and Pink Par­lour, have also joined the plat­form.</p>
    <p>Users can find vouch­ers on the site by re­gion or cat­e­gory, or search for their favourite names.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers can be bought for both per­sonal use as well as giv­ing away to friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prises that want to list their deals as part of the cam­paign can do so by writ­ing in to sfg­mer­chant@ sph.com.sg from now un­til Aug 31.</p>
    <p>An­glo In­dian Cafe & Bar’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Vinod Jhak­mola said that the food and bev­er­age sec­tor has been one of the hard­est hit due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The fact that we are get­ting a com­pli­men­tary list­ing and have part­nered Shop For Good for voucher sales makes it even more ap­peal­ing for us,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing for busi­ness and we would like to reach out to both new and ex­ist­ing pa­trons of An­glo In­dian Cafe & Bar.”</p>
