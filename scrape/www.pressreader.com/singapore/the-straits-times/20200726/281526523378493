    <p>Yeo Jun Wei, also known as Dick­son Yeo, stud­ied at Na­tional Ju­nior Col­lege from 1998 to 1999 and then went on to se­cure a Bach­e­lor of Arts in mass com­mu­ni­ca­tion and me­dia stud­ies from Ok­la­homa City Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He pro­ceeded to do a Master of Arts in South-east Asian stud­ies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore from 2009 to 2011, be­fore head­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Univer­sity of Ja­pan in Ni­igata for a Master of Arts in in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>In 2015, he en­rolled for a PhD at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy (LKYSPP) in Sin­ga­pore. Be­tween June 2016 and Jan­uary last year, while still at the LKYSPP, Yeo vis­ited Bei­jing as a re­searcher at Pek­ing Univer­sity’s Na­tional In­sti­tute of Strate­gic Com­mu­ni­ca­tion, ac­cord­ing to his pro­file on LinkedIn which ap­peared to have been taken down early yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Yeo’s time at the LKYSPP over­lapped with that of one of its for­mer pro­fes­sors, Huang Jing, who was ex­pelled from Sin­ga­pore in 2017 “for be­ing a Chi­nese agent of in­flu­ence”, re­tired diplo­mat Bi­la­hari Kausikan said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It is not un­rea­son­able to as­sume he was re­cruited or at least talent spot­ted by the MSS (China’s Min­istry of State Se­cu­rity) there,” Mr Kausikan said.</p>
    <p>In another post, Mr Kausikan said that Mr Huang was Yeo’s PhD su­per­vi­sor un­til 2017 when the pro­fes­sor was ex­pelled.</p>
    <p>In Jan 2018, Yeo set up Res­o­lute Con­sult­ing, a po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy which he ad­mit­ted in United States court doc­u­ments was a front for his ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On LinkedIn, he de­scribed it as a busi­ness ven­ture “pro­vid­ing anal­y­sis and po­lit­i­cal econ­omy risk con­sul­tancy work for Eurasian clients”.</p>
    <p>He said it was a joint ven­ture be­tween him­self and clients based in Tokyo, Shang­hai, Bei­jing and New Delhi.</p>
    <p>On LinkedIn, Yeo also listed him­self as a doc­toral fel­low “work­ing on the for­eign pol­icy of smaller strate­gic states in light of US-China com­pe­ti­tion” at The Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity in Wash­ing­ton from Jan­uary to July last year.</p>
    <p>US court doc­u­ments said this was the pe­riod dur­ing which he sought to re­cruit in­di­vid­u­als to pro­vide China with sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion. He was ar­rested when he re­turned to the US cap­i­tal in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>LKYSPP’s dean, Pro­fes­sor Danny Quah, in an e-mail to fac­ulty and stu­dents, said Yeo ap­plied for and was granted a leave of ab­sence from the school’s PhD pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“This in­ci­dent is spe­cific to Mr Yeo as an in­di­vid­ual. No fac­ulty or other stu­dents at our school are known to be in­volved,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“The mat­ter is one of US na­tional se­cu­rity, and the school has no fur­ther knowl­edge on de­tails of the case be­yond what is pub­licly avail­able,” said Prof Quah.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs said that it is aware of Yeo’s guilty plea and is “ren­der­ing the ap­pro­pri­ate con­sular as­sis­tance, as re­quired”.</p>
