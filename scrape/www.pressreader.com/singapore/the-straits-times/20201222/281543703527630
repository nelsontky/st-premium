    <p>The first batch of the Covid-19 vac­cine has landed in Sin­ga­pore, mark­ing a cru­cial step to­wards vac­ci­nat­ing the pop­u­la­tion. The vac­cine – the first ship­ment from Pfizer-BioNTech to ar­rive in Asia – was car­ried by a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Boe­ing 747-400 freighter. It landed at Changi Air­port at 7.36pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The first batch of Covid-19 vac­cines has landed here, as Sin­ga­pore takes a cru­cial step to­wards vac­ci­nat­ing its pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines – the first ship­ment from Pfizer-BioNTech to ar­rive in Asia – were car­ried by a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) Boe­ing 747-400 freighter, SQ7979.</p>
    <p>The cargo flight had de­parted from Brus­sels, Bel­gium, on Sun­day and landed at Changi Air­port at 7.36pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ship­ment was pri­ori­tised for load­ing onto the air­craft in Brus­sels, as well as dur­ing un­load­ing in Sin­ga­pore, SIA said.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore di­rec­tor-gen­eral Kevin Shum and the chief ex­ec­u­tives of Changi Air­port Group and SIA were among those who wit­nessed the ar­rival of the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Ground han­dler Sats moved the vac­cines to its cold chain fa­cil­ity, Sats Cool­port, be­fore they were loaded onto a re­frig­er­ated truck that will send them to a des­ig­nated undis­closed lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said he was de­lighted to see the ar­rival of the first ship­ment of vac­cines, and thanked var­i­ous agen­cies and work­ers that made this pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a long and ar­du­ous year. I hope that this news will give Sin­ga­pore­ans cheer this fes­tive sea­son, and rea­son to be op­ti­mistic for 2021.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters at the fa­cil­ity, Mr Ong said: “We are ready to (han­dle vac­cine cargo) and a lot of prepa­ra­tion work has gone into mak­ing this as smooth as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The Multi-Min­istry Task­force is work­ing out de­tails on the roll-out of vac­ci­na­tions, based on pri­or­ity groups and the ex­pected de­liv­ery sched­ule of the vac­cines, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, in a Face­book post last evening.</p>
    <p>“We will put out more de­tails when ready, so that ev­ery­one will know when they can ac­cess the vac­cine, and how to go about getting one,” said Mr Wong, who cochairs the task force.</p>
    <p>He said this in­volved a mas­sive op­er­a­tions and lo­gis­tics ef­fort, since the vac­cines could be kept at nor­mal re­frig­er­a­tion con­di­tions for just five days, once they were taken out of frozen stor­age.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, SIA said it had con­ducted a trial along the same freighter flight route last Satur­day, to test its vac­cine han­dling ca­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>It car­ried out the trial with cool boxes that would be used to hold the ac­tual vac­cines, and had tracked the in­ter­nal tem­per­a­ture within th­ese boxes through­out the flight. It also mon­i­tored the rate at which dry ice within the box turned into car­bon diox­ide. The vac­cines need to be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine is the first Covid-19 vac­cine ap­proved in Sin­ga­pore. Other vac­cines are ex­pected to ar­rive in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines will be of­fered on a free and vol­un­tary ba­sis to all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are cur­rently here. Pri­or­ity will be given to health­care and front-line work­ers, as well as el­derly and vul­ner­a­ble pa­tients.</p>
    <p>If all goes to plan, there will be enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore by the third quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>A high vac­cine adop­tion rate will help to com­bat the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion here, which saw 10 new Covid-19 cases con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also po­si­tion­ing it­self to be a hub for the move­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines to the re­gion.</p>
    <p>KEY ROLE IN COVID-19 FIGHT</p>

    <p>Sin­ga­pore wants to be­come a Covid-19 vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion hub for the re­gion, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said the Re­pub­lic has the ca­pa­bil­i­ties to make sure the process is se­cure and there is ad­e­quate ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>“Some coun­tries, of course, would pre­fer di­rect de­liv­ery be­cause they will think that it’s faster, so point-to-point de­liv­ery, but I think there’s also a case to say that a place like Sin­ga­pore, with our Changi fam­ily, we can also play a role as a hub for dis­tri­bu­tion and trans­porta­tion to the re­gion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think they are mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong was speak­ing to the me­dia at a cold chain man­age­ment fa­cil­ity run by cargo han­dler Sats, af­ter wel­com­ing the ar­rival of the first batch of Covid-19 vac­cines in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Our staff, our lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies, they all have been trained up to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion stan­dards to be able to han­dle all this cargo safely,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>“In terms of ca­pac­ity, we have quite a huge ca­pac­ity... more than ad­e­quate to han­dle tem­per­a­ture­con­trolled cargo.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said the es­ti­mated cargo move­ment for vac­cines is about 65,000 tonnes world­wide but lo­cal han­dler Sats dealt with more than 300,000 tonnes of tem­per­a­ture-con­trolled ship­ment in the last year alone.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic also has the sup­port of firms in­clud­ing lo­gis­tics gi­ants DHL, UPS and FedEx, as well as phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Every­thing must come to­gether,” said Mr Ong. “We have worked on it for sev­eral months and we’ll con­tinue to work on it.”</p>
    <p>There has been hope that posi</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries, of course, would pre­fer di­rect de­liv­ery be­cause they will think that it’s faster, so point-to-point de­liv­ery, but I think there’s also a case to say that a place like Sin­ga­pore with our Changi fam­ily, we can also play a role as a hub for dis­tri­bu­tion and trans­porta­tion to the re­gion... I don’t think they are mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG</p>
    <p>tion­ing Sin­ga­pore as a hub for vac­cine trans­porta­tion could give the bat­tered avi­a­tion sec­tor an­other boost as it seeks to con­tinue its grad­ual re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>In the last few months, the air</p>
    <p>cargo in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore has been in­ten­si­fy­ing prepa­ra­tions to safely trans­port Covid-19 vac­cines in a con­stant tem­per­a­ture-con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, the Civil Avi­a­tion Au</p>
    <p>thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore and Changi Air­port Group (CAG) set up a task force com­pris­ing 18 mem­bers to look into im­prov­ing the process.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said they had been iden­ti­fy­ing pos­si­ble chal­lenges and seek</p>
    <p>ing to ad­dress them even be­fore a vac­cine was pro­duced.</p>
    <p>“One ex­am­ple was when they got to know that the Pfizer vac­cine re­quires mi­nus 70 deg C of stor­age, they started to look at dry ice pro</p>
    <p>duc­tion,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>“So to­day Sats can pro­duce four tonnes of dry ice ev­ery day in its... own fa­cil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>This work, which also in­volved trial runs, has helped to en­sure that the first ship­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore safely, said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>He said the ship­ment of the vac­cine was a joint ef­fort in­volv­ing sev­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing the</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), which flew in the vac­cine from Brus­sels on its cargo plane, said yes­ter­day that it was honoured to be able to play its part in an im­por­tant mile­stone in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>SIA se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for cargo Chin Yau Seng said: “It also served to demon­strate SIA’s and the Sin­ga­pore air hub’s readi­ness for the very im­por­tant job of trans­port­ing and dis­tribut­ing Covid-19 vac­cines in­ter­na­tion­ally.”</p>
