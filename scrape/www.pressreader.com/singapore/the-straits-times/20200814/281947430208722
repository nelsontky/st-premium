    <p>A do­mes­tic helper who pushed a 92-year-old wo­man on the chest, caus­ing her to fall and hit her head, was yesterday sen­tenced to three years’ jail for caus­ing griev­ous hurt.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim, Madam Wong Yong, was left bedrid­den un­til her death.</p>
    <p>The court heard that San­dar Aye, 33, re­peat­edly de­nied push­ing the vic­tim after she was ar­rested. But she was caught do­ing so on closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion (CCTV) cam­era footage.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent oc­curred on Sept 5 last year, just over three weeks after the Myan­mar na­tional was hired to care for the el­derly wo­man who had mild de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Only the two women were liv­ing in the flat.</p>
    <p>At about 8pm that day, the pair got into an ar­gu­ment, which led to the maid push­ing the vic­tim on the chest force­fully, caus­ing her to hit her head against the wall while fall­ing onto the floor.</p>
    <p>After walk­ing away mo­men­tar­ily, San­dar Aye re­turned and pulled Madam Wong up from the floor by “yank­ing the vic­tim’s left arm”, said Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Phoebe Tan.</p>
    <p>While the el­derly wo­man was sit­ting in an up­right po­si­tion, San­dar Aye grabbed her fore­arms and spoke close to her face.</p>
    <p>The el­derly wo­man re­acted by strug­gling, grab­bing the maid’s fore­arms and slap­ping her on the face sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the in­ci­dent, the maid called Madam Wong’s son and told him that his mother had fallen.</p>
    <p>He ar­rived two hours later, but Madam Wong was sleep­ing in her bed­room and he did not want to wake her.</p>
    <p>He asked San­dar Aye how his mother had hurt her­self and the maid claimed the old wo­man had fallen back­wards i n the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>The next morn­ing, Madam Wong’s son re­turned and found that his mother was un­able to move her head and legs and was in pain.</p>
    <p>Madam Wong was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, where she was di­ag­nosed with sev­eral frac­tures, in­clud­ing in her pelvis and spine, which left her bedrid­den.</p>
    <p>The cause of Madam Wong’s in­juries sur­faced when her daugh­ter re­viewed the CCTV footage from the cam­era in the flat.</p>
    <p>A po­lice re­port was made three days after the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Madam Wong was dis­charged to a nurs­ing home on Oct 9 and died on Jan 2 from un­re­lated causes.</p>
    <p>For caus­ing griev­ous hurt, San­dar Aye could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.</p>
