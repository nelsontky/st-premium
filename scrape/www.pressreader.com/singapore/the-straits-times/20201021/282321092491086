    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • World No. 1 Dustin John­son has pulled out of this week’s Zozo Cham­pi­onship in Los An­ge­les, the sec­ond straight event he has with­drawn from af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old is re­cov­er­ing af­ter ex­pe­ri­enc­ing some Covid-19 symp­toms but is still not well enough to re­sume play­ing com­pet­i­tive golf, his agent David Win­kle said.</p>
    <p>“While he is feel­ing much bet­ter, he is still a bit low on en­ergy and feels it would be best to wait and re­sume his sched­ule in Hous­ton,” Win­kle told Golfweek.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can also with­drew from last week’s CJ Cup tour­na­ment in Las Ve­gas. If he con­tin­ues to get bet­ter, his next event will be the Hous­ton Open at Me­mo­rial Park Golf Course from Nov 5 to 8.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the Zozo Cham­pi­onship was moved to the Sher­wood Coun­try Club near Los An­ge­les af­ter mak­ing its de­but in Ja­pan last year. Tiger Woods is the de­fend­ing cham­pion and is in the field.</p>
    <p>The PGA Tour’s next event is the Ber­muda Cham­pi­onship from Oct 29 to Nov 1. This year’s Hero World Chal­lenge in the Ba­hamas, to be played from Dec 3 to 6, has been can­celled be­cause of travel re­stric­tions amid the pan­demic, or­gan­is­ers said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, fans are in for a feast of match­play golf be­tween the best of the US and the cream of Europe, af­ter it was an­nounced on Mon­day that the Sol­heim Cup and Ry­der Cup will be played back-to-back for the first time in 2023.</p>
    <p>Spain will host the women’s Sol­heim Cup US v Europe match for the first time at Finca Cortesin on the Costa del Sol from Sept 22-24, 2023, and the Marco Si­mone Golf and Coun­try Club is the venue for Italy’s de­but as a Ry­der Cup host a week later.</p>
    <p>Nor­mally the women’s and men’s show­downs take place in al­ter­nate years. But when the 2020 Ry­der Cup was post­poned un­til next year by the pan­demic, the knock-on ef­fect was that Italy would host in 2023, giv­ing of­fi­cials the chance to co­or­di­nate dates to gen­er­ate height­ened in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>“The fact it is also a first for both host­ing na­tions sim­ply adds to the an­tic­i­pa­tion,” said Keith Pel­ley, Euro­pean Tour chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>The next Sol­heim Cup is sched­uled for Sept 4-6 next year at the In­ver­ness Club in Ohio. The de­layed Ry­der Cup at Whistling Straits will be held from Sept 25-27 next year.</p>
