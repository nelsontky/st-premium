    <p>I have been for­tu­nate enough to be able to travel abroad, to visit and ex­pe­ri­ence var­i­ous coun­tries and cul­tures through­out the years, be it for hol­i­days, swim­ming or school.</p>
    <p>Trav­el­ling with the Sin­ga­pore na­tional team is easy. We are al­ways led around by team man­agers and coaches. I am so well taken care of that I could close my eyes and not get lost. Trav­el­ling to Hun­gary for the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League (ISL) was a whole dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>STRESS AND SWAB­BING</p>
    <p>The lead-up to Hun­gary was hec­tic. On top of the stress of pack­ing for a two-month train­ing and com­pe­ti­tion trip, there was the is­sue of trav­el­ling amid a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>I was in­structed to do two Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests within five days of my ar­rival date in Hun­gary.</p>
    <p>My flight had been sched­uled for Saturday, so I had to do the tests on Wed­nes­day and Fri­day. It was a rush to get the test ap­provals ex­pe­dited, and I got the ap­proval e-mail only on the day of the test.</p>
    <p>The stress only in­creased when I was in­formed that my flight on Saturday got can­celled and I had been moved to a Sun­day. This brought up two prob­lems, the first be­ing that I had to be in Hun­gary by Sun­day to make it into the swim­mer bub­ble, so find­ing another flight on Saturday was im­per­a­tive. The sec­ond is­sue was that if my flight had been moved a day later, it meant that the PCR swab tests I did would be in­valid.</p>
    <p>My ISL man­ager is based in the US and the travel agents for our team – DC Tri­dent – are in Europe, so the time dif­fer­ence and try­ing to co­or­di­nate between par­ties got very stress­ful. It felt like a wait­ing game, writ­ing e-mails and texts and wait­ing to hear back from them. All I could do was pack my bags and do my two swab tests and hope for the best.</p>
    <p>Pack­ing was tough. Be­sides warm cloth­ing, rac­ing and train­ing equip­ment and nu­tri­tional needs, I had to pack masks, hand sani­tis­ers and dis­in­fec­tant wipes.</p>
    <p>My flight was fi­nally con­firmed on Fri­day. But I found out af­ter­wards that I might have trou­ble en­ter­ing the Nether­lands to make the tran­sit flight.</p>
    <p>I spent the whole of Saturday try­ing to con­tact the air­lines, be­fore fi­nally de­cid­ing to just go to Changi with my bags and my doc­u­ments and try to fig­ure it out at the front desk. Af­ter an hour of to­ing and fro­ing, show­ing of doc­u­ments, mul­ti­ple phone calls, and pro­cure­ment of even more doc­u­ments, I was fi­nally al­lowed to check in my bag. I breathed a sigh of re­lief and headed into the depar­ture hall.</p>
    <p>From then on it was smoother, but the ex­pe­ri­ence also be­came much stranger. The usu­ally bustling and brightly lit hall was empty, dark and silent. Stores and food out­lets were closed. It felt as though I was like walk­ing through a ghost town.</p>
    <p>Get­ting on a near-empty flight was sur­real. It felt like tak­ing the late-night bus or train – there were rows and rows of empty seats, no one in sight. It was the smoothest flight I had ever been on.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING TO BE FLEX­I­BLE</p>
    <p>My flight from Am­s­ter­dam to Bu­dapest looked very dif­fer­ent from my first. The plane was packed with swim­mers ar­riv­ing from all over the world, also mak­ing their way to Bu­dapest.</p>
    <p>It struck me that I would soon be sur­rounded by peo­ple just like me for an ex­tended pe­riod of time, and that is when the nerves and ex­cite­ment hit.</p>
    <p>We landed and were put on buses to the ho­tel. It is my first time in</p>
    <p>Hun­gary, and it is beau­ti­ful. I have not been to Europe much but, from what lit­tle I saw, the ar­chi­tec­ture alone makes me want to visit this con­ti­nent more in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>We were driven to Mar­garet Island, (2.5km long and 500m wide), nes­tled in the mid­dle of Buda and Pest, where all of us will be liv­ing in a bub­ble for the next six weeks.</p>
    <p>While I am bummed I would not get to ex­plore the city while I am</p>
    <p>here, the Covid-19 cases here have been ris­ing and my va­ca­tion can wait. As it is, Olympic and mul­ti­ple world cham­pion Fed­er­ica Pel­le­grini just tested pos­i­tive for the virus, and that only serves as a star­tling re­minder that even the fit and the strong are sus­cep­ti­ble to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­ing dropped off at the En­sana Ther­mal Mar­git­sziget Health Spa Ho­tel, we had to take another swab test. We had to stay in our rooms for 12 hours while wait­ing for the re­sults of our tests, and so I un­packed, took a hot shower, stretched and went to bed early.</p>
    <p>On Monday, all of us tested neg­a­tive and we were al­lowed out of our rooms to roam the ho­tel and meet one another prop­erly. We had a team meeting, where we were in­formed that changes were con­stantly be­ing made, from the safety pro­to­cols to the rac­ing sched­ule, to our train­ing times and gym lo­ca­tions. As a crea­ture of habit, I knew that be­ing kept on my toes like that could get drain­ing, but I de­cided to see it as a chal­lenge to help me be bet­ter – a way to teach my­self to adapt and learn to be more flex­i­ble.</p>
    <p>TIGHT RE­STRIC­TIONS</p>
    <p>We are al­lowed 90 min­utes of our “own” time out­side the ho­tel ev­ery day, and there is a board by the ho­tel doors for peo­ple to sign in and out, as a way to keep ev­ery­one ac­count­able and safe. There are also hand-sani­tiser sta­tions ev­ery­where and a tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing ma­chine right when we en­ter the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The 10 teams are split between two ho­tels, and the scheduling is done in such a way where we min­gle with one another as lit­tle as pos­si­ble, to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing. We have dif­fer­ent din­ing times, dif­fer­ent train­ing slots, and we are placed in dif­fer­ent pools. Dif­fer­ent teams are put on sep­a­rate ho­tel floors, and the rule is that only two peo­ple are al­lowed in the lifts at once.</p>
    <p>There are “Covid mar­shals”, vol­un­teers who mon­i­tor the teams, and word on the street is that peo­ple who do not abide by safety rules will have points de­ducted from their over­all team scores. I feel like I am in a sports pro­duc­tion of Harry Pot­ter.</p>
    <p>Over the next few days, we trained as a team at the Duna Arena, a beau­ti­ful, mod­ern fa­cil­ity with four dif­fer­ent pools. We got to know one another bet­ter and learnt how to work to­gether. My team is made up of swim­mers from nine dif­fer­ent coun­tries. We might not be as di­verse as some other teams, and cul­tural and lan­guage dif­fer­ences can some­times serve as bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>I am quite pleased to say that I think we were all quite com­fort­able around one another by the time we were through the first week. I heard many of my team­mates’ sto­ries, and am ex­cited at the prospect of learn­ing even more in the weeks to come.</p>
    <p>Get­ting on a near-empty flight was sur­real. It felt like tak­ing the late-night bus or train – there were rows and rows of empty seats, no one in sight. It was the smoothest flight I had ever been on.</p>
