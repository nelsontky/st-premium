    <p>Lo­cal sports of­fi­cials are mak­ing their mark on the in­ter­na­tional scene. Ja­son Lim, 48, now sits on the World As­so­ci­a­tion of Kick­box­ing Or­gan­i­sa­tions’ devel­op­ment com­mit­tee, while Koh Koon Teck, 54, is chair­man of the In­ter­na­tional Bowl­ing Fed­er­a­tion’s global coach ed­u­ca­tion path­way.</p>
    <p>Two Sin­ga­porean sports of­fi­cials had ex­tra rea­son to cel­e­brate over the fes­tive pe­riod, af­ter they were ap­pointed to key roles at world gov­ern­ing bod­ies for their re­spec­tive sports last week.</p>
    <p>Ja­son Lim was named on the devel­op­ment com­mit­tee of the World As­so­ci­a­tion of Kick­box­ing Or­gan­i­sa­tions (Wako) while Koh Koon Teck was made chair­man of the In­ter­na­tional Bowl­ing Fed­er­a­tion’s (IBF) global coach ed­u­ca­tion path­way.</p>
    <p>Both are serv­ing their roles on ini­tial two-year terms.</p>
    <p>The duo join a group of Sin­ga­pore­ans who are cur­rently serv­ing in in­ter­na­tional sports bod­ies, in­clud­ing In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) vice-pres­i­dent Ng Ser Miang, Dr Bene­dict Tan, who is a mem­ber of IOC’s med­i­cal and sci­en­tific com­mis­sion and chair of World Sail­ing’s med­i­cal com­mis­sion, and Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Lim Kia Tong and Sham­sul Maidin, who are in Fifa’s dis­ci­plinary and ref­er­ees com­mit­tees re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>For Kick­box­ing Fed­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (KFS) pres­i­dent Lim, 48, his global ap­point­ment came on the back of a kick­box­ing pro­gramme he had started in 2017 for Peo­ple with Parkin­son’s (PwPs) here to help them slow the on­set of the ner­vous sys­tem dis­or­der and achieve a bet­ter qual­ity of life.</p>
    <p>He is now part of a 10-strong Wako com­mit­tee fo­cused on util­is­ing kick­box­ing to spear­head global de­vel­op­men­tal projects with so­cial in­clu­sion, through pro­grammes such as the one Lim in­tro­duced here which has since reached over 100 PwPs.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor of kick­box­ing fit­ness cen­tre Ac­tive Red said: “Wako took no­tice of what we did, and since they be­came a part of the Olympic move­ment (as a pro­vi­sional mem­ber in 2018), there has been a move to­wards us­ing the sport to reach out to the com­mu­nity, par­tic­u­larly the un­der­priv­i­leged.”</p>
    <p>Wako pres­i­dent Roy Baker noted in a me­dia state­ment: “(Lim) has done a tremen­dous amount of work and cre­ated so­cially-in­clu­sive projects which touched many lives in dif­fer­ent pos­i­tive ways. This ap­point­ment is our af­fir­ma­tion to­wards his work and we strongly be­lieve that his in­sights will be highly ben­e­fi­cial in our fu­ture projects within his ar­eas of spe­cial­ity.”</p>
    <p>KFS and Wako are work­ing to­gether to or­gan­ise the first Asian Wako con­fer­ence, which is ten­ta­tively sched­uled to be hosted here in June with about 120 over­seas del­e­gates.</p>
    <p>For Koh, his ap­point­ment at the IBF ap­pears on pa­per a cu­ri­ous one as he is more com­monly as­so­ci­ated with an­other sport – bas­ket­ball.</p>
    <p>The 54-year-old, an as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor and head of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion’s phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion & sports science depart­ment, is the Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s hon­orary sec­re­tary. The for­mer semi-pro­fes­sional player is also a mem­ber of the tech­ni­cal com­mis­sion for world gov­ern­ing body In­ter­na­tional Bas­ket­ball Fed­er­a­tion (Fiba).</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that the IBF had reached out to him in Au­gust, partly based on his work with Fiba, as the bowl­ing fed­er­a­tion wanted to im­ple­ment a tiered coach ed­u­ca­tion cer­ti­fi­ca­tion course.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ting that his lack of back­ground in bowl­ing meant he was lim­ited when it came to the sport’s tech­ni­cal as­pects, Koh said that the IBF was nev­er­the­less con­fi­dent it would not af­fect his abil­ity to set up the coach­ing frame­work.</p>
    <p>He added: “What I can of­fer them is in the area of pro­gramme de­sign, but the tech­ni­cal as­pect we would need to rely on the team of world-class coaches and tech­ni­cal ex­perts that the IBF has.”</p>
    <p>He added that two mem­bers on his com­mit­tee also do not have a bowl­ing back­ground – they in­stead pre­vi­ously served in the In­ter­na­tional Hockey Fed­er­a­tion – and said that some­one from out­side bowl­ing could bring fresh eyes when faced with chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Koh said the com­mit­tee hopes to un­veil a Level 1 coach­ing pro­gramme next year which will be tai­lored around lim­i­ta­tions that have arisen in the Covid-19 re­al­ity and in­clude a sig­nif­i­cant amount of video and on­line el­e­ments.</p>
