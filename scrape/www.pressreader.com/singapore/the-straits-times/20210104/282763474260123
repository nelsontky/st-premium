    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES</p>
    <p>• Ac­tor and host James Cor­den (left) has a new year’s res­o­lu­tion which is not un­like that of many peo­ple – to lose weight. The Late Late Show host said: “I’m fed up with the way I look. I’m fed up with be­ing un­healthy.”</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old Bri­ton re­vealed that he had tried var­i­ous di­ets and failed re­peat­edly for years. “I’ve re­alised that ev­ery year for the past decade – prob­a­bly even 15 years – on Jan 1, I’ve told my­self and any­one who would lis­ten that this is it, this is the year. I’m go­ing on a diet. I’m go­ing to lose a load of weight.”</p>
    <p>He ap­proached WW (for­merly known as Weight Watch­ers), a weight-loss and fit­ness pro­gramme, for help.</p>
    <p>In a clip an­nounc­ing his WW part­ner­ship last Fri­day, he said: “Over Christ­mas, I’ve eaten every­thing that’s in the fridge be­cause in my head, in Jan­uary I’m start­ing this diet and it’ll be a suc­cess. And, as you can see, it hasn’t (been).”</p>
    <p>He added in a press re­lease: “I want to change the way that I live. I want to be bet­ter for my chil­dren and for my fam­ily. I don’t want to wake up tired or feel em­bar­rassed when I’m chas­ing my son on the foot­ball field and out of breath af­ter three min­utes.”</p>
    <p>Cor­den has three chil­dren un­der the age of 10 with wife Ju­lia Carey, a tele­vi­sion pro­ducer. He has spo­ken out in the past about his weight and strug­gles to get roles be­cause of his size.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The New Yorker in Jan­uary last year, he said: “I was good for play­ing a bub­bly judge in a court­room or I’d be the guy who drops off a TV to Hugh Grant in a movie.</p>
    <p>“If some­one came from an­other planet and put on the tele­vi­sion, you would think that peo­ple who are big or over­weight don’t have sex. They don’t fall in love. They’re friends of peo­ple who fall in love. They’re prob­a­bly not that bright, but they’re a good time, and they’re not as valu­able as peo­ple who are re­ally good-look­ing.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, his res­o­lu­tion stems not from a de­sire for meatier roles, but rather a con­cern for his health.</p>
    <p>He said: “The weight is not the is­sue. It’s the well­ness of it I am ready to tackle. I’m go­ing to take this year and work to­wards get­ting healthy.”</p>
