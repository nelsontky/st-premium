    <p>NEW YORK Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas suf­fered one of his most heart­break­ing losses, as his bid for a first Grand Slam ti­tle at the US Open ended on Fri­day af­ter he squan­dered six match points.</p>
    <p>Borna Coric ral­lied from 5-1 down in the fourth set to stun the Greek 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4) and send the fourth seed tum­bling out in the third round.</p>
    <p>The Croat made a re­mark­able come­back at an empty Louis Arm­strong Sta­dium to face Aus­tralian Jor­dan Thomp­son for a spot in his first Ma­jor quar­ter-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Tsit­si­pas twice served for the match in the fourth set and was up a break in the fifth but could not put the gritty 27th seed away.</p>
    <p>Tsit­si­pas made just one dou­ble fault in his first 29 ser­vice games, but hit two in the fi­nal-set tiebreak. A fore­hand er­ror on Coric’s sec­ond match point ended pro­ceed­ings at 1.09am lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>“This is prob­a­bly the sad­dest and fun­ni­est at the same time thing that has ever hap­pened in my ca­reer!” the 22-year-old, who won the ATP Fi­nals last sea­son, wrote on Twit­ter af­ter skip­ping the press con­fer­ence due to the late fin­ish.</p>
    <p>Coric ad­mit­ted that he was for­tu­nate to get through in 4hr 36min.</p>
    <p>“At 5-4, I think he was 40-0... it was just pure luck,” said the Croat, one of four play­ers to test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 af­ter play­ing on the ill­fated Adria Tour ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“I just made some un­be­liev­able re­turns... In the third and fourth sets he was play­ing un­be­liev­able ten­nis and I felt I had ab­so­lutely no chance.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, fifth seed Alexan­der Zverev de­feated Adrian Man­nar­ino 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 in a mys­tery-laden third-round match that was de­layed by three hours.</p>
    <p>France’s Man­nar­ino was one of sev­eral play­ers un­der en­hanced safety pro­to­cols ear­lier in the week af­ter com­pa­triot Benoit Paire tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. New York state ap­par­ently staged a last­minute in­ter­ven­tion to try to pre­vent him from play­ing in the match sched­uled for 2.30pm.</p>
    <p>“That was big news for me. I mean, I was ready to go on court,” Man­nar­ino said of tour­na­ment or­gan­is­ers telling him the state’s health de­part­ment had con­tacted them to say he should be quar­an­tin­ing in his ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>The United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion then en­gaged in “col­lab­o­ra­tive di­a­logue” with health of­fi­cials, and he found out at 4.40pm that he was per­mit­ted to play af­ter all.</p>
