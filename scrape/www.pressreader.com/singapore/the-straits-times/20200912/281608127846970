    <p>Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe yes­ter­day paved the way for the coun­try to ac­quire first-strike ca­pa­bil­ity on en­emy mis­sile bases, his swan­song act in of­fice be­fore step­ping down next week. But he said the move would be up to the new gov­ern­ment to fol­low through.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe paved the way for the ac­qui­si­tion of first-strike ca­pa­bil­ity on en­emy mis­sile bases yes­ter­day, but said it will be up to the new gov­ern­ment to fol­low through.</p>
    <p>“Is it re­ally pos­si­ble that in­ter­cept­ing at­tacks alone will be enough to pro­tect peace, lives and peo­ple’s liveli­hoods?” Mr Abe said in a state­ment af­ter at­tend­ing a Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil (NSC) meeting.</p>
    <p>“It is nec­es­sary to in­crease deter­rence and fur­ther re­duce the prob­a­bil­ity of bal­lis­tic mis­sile at­tacks on Ja­pan,” he said, adding that his suc­ces­sor will de­cide on a new de­fence plan by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the very idea that Ja­pan might ac­quire a strike ca­pa­bil­ity – even if couched in the name of de­fence – is con­tro­ver­sial and would be one of the great­est par­a­digm shifts in its de­fence pol­icy since World War II.</p>
    <p>But Mr Abe stressed that Ja­pan will act within the frame­work of its war-re­nounc­ing Con­sti­tu­tion and com­ply with in­ter­na­tional law, say­ing: “There is no change to our de­fence-ori­ented pos­ture.”</p>
    <p>The move is one of Mr Abe’s swan­song acts be­fore he steps down, with his suc­ces­sor to be iden­ti­fied in a Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party elec­tion on Mon­day and in­au­gu­rated on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>While it has no bind­ing ef­fect on the new gov­ern­ment, his prob­a­ble suc­ces­sor, Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary</p>
    <p>Yoshi­hide Suga who was also at the meeting, will see no rea­son not to heed the di­rec­tion set by Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the tim­ing was a de­lib­er­ate at­tempt by Mr Abe to im­print his legacy on de­fence is­sues af­ter his con­tro­ver­sial bid to re­vise the Con­sti­tu­tion fell apart.</p>
    <p>A first-strike ca­pa­bil­ity means Ja­pan will be able to launch a strike on en­emy bases be­fore mis­siles are fired – un­like now, when it can stop tar­gets only af­ter their launch. It will also al­low, for the first time, the mil­i­tary to plan strikes on land tar­gets, as op­posed to stop­ping at­tacks in the air and sea.</p>
    <p>The plan will i nvolve buy­ing long-range weapons.</p>
    <p>Re­tired Ja­panese ad­mi­ral Kat­su­toshi Kawano told Reuters that US­made BGM-109 Tom­a­hawk cruise mis­siles that can hit tar­gets 2,500km away were an op­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s state­ment specif­i­cally pointed to North Korea, with “its arse­nal of sev­eral hun­dred bal­lis­tic mis­siles that have Ja­pan within range”, as an im­mi­nent threat.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther warned that Py­ongyang has suc­ceeded in minia­tur­is­ing nu­clear war­heads that can be mounted on these bal­lis­tic mis­siles.</p>
    <p>But Kobe Univer­sity se­cu­rity ex­pert Tosh Mi­no­hara be­lieves that the sin­gling out of North Korea is to make the strat­egy more po­lit­i­cally cor­rect. He said: “We should not un­der­es­ti­mate North Korea but China is the real rea­son.”</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono said China poses a se­cu­rity threat to Ja­pan. “We are pre­pared to de­fend every cen­time­tre of our land, and I be­lieve the al­liance (with the US) is will­ing to fight over the Senkaku Is­lands,” he said, re­fer­ring to the dis­puted set of islets in the East China Sea that Beijing refers to as the Diaoyus.</p>
    <p>The same day, Ja­pan signed a mil­i­tary sup­ply-shar­ing pact with In­dia, which has a bor­der row with China that turned deadly in June.</p>
    <p>The move is sig­nif­i­cant as it ce­ments the Quad, the se­cu­rity part­ner­ship among the US, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia, all of which have sim­i­lar bi­lat­eral sup­ply-shar­ing ar­range­ments with each other.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, in a tele­phone sum­mit with his In­dian coun­ter­part Naren­dra Modi, said their na­tions share the com­mit­ment of re­al­is­ing a free and open Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s NSC meeting came fol­low­ing the scrap­ping, in June, of a plan to de­ploy the land-based Aegis Ashore mis­sile de­fence sys­tem in a sur­prise U-turn, af­ter a costly tech­ni­cal re­design was deemed nec­es­sary for safety rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is also con­sid­er­ing ex­pand­ing its fleet of Aegis war­ships and build­ing off­shore fa­cil­i­ties with radar and launch­ers.</p>

North Korea was sin&#xAD;gled out as an im&#xAD;mi&#xAD;nent threat by out&#xAD;go&#xAD;ing Ja&#xAD;panese Prime Min&#xAD;is&#xAD;ter Shinzo Abe, who called for Ja&#xAD;pan&#x2019;s ac&#xAD;qui&#xAD;si&#xAD;tion of first-strike ca&#xAD;pa&#xAD;bil&#xAD;ity on en&#xAD;emy mis&#xAD;sile bases, but stressed that the coun&#xAD;try will act within the frame&#xAD;work of its war-re&#xAD;nounc&#xAD;ing Con&#xAD;sti&#xAD;tu&#xAD;tion.</p>
