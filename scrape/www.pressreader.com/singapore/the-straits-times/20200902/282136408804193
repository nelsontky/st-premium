    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Ap­ple has asked sup­pli­ers to build at least 75 mil­lion 5G iPhones for later this year, roughly in line with last year’s launch, in a sign that de­mand for the com­pany’s most im­por­tant prod­uct is hold­ing up amid the global pan­demic and re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy gi­ant an­tic­i­pates ship­ments of these nextgen­er­a­tion iPhones may reach as high as 80 mil­lion units this year, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple plans to launch four new mod­els next month with fifth-gen­er­a­tion wire­less speeds, a dif­fer­ent de­sign and a wider choice of screen sizes, said the peo­ple, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Among a com­pre­hen­sive prod­uct re­fresh in the au­tumn, Ap­ple is also pre­par­ing a new iPad Air with an edge-to-edge i Pad Pro-like screen, two new Ap­ple Watch ver­sions and its first over-ear head­phones out­side the Beats brand. A smaller HomePod speaker is in the works too. An Ap­ple spokesman de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and its man­u­fac­tur­ing part­ners al­ways ramp up pro­duc­tion ahead of the roll-out of new iPhones each au­tumn. In the sum­mer of last year, sup­pli­ers were pre­par­ing to make com­po­nents for as many as 75 mil­lion hand­sets. The tar­get in 2018 was sim­i­lar, so this year’s goal of 75 mil­lion to 80 mil­lion units is a bullish sign.</p>
    <p>Key as­sem­bly part­ner Hon Hai Pre­ci­sion In­dus­try, also known as Fox­conn, has put up sev­eral no­tices on WeChat over the past month re­cruit­ing work­ers for its main iPhone cam­pus in the cen­tral Chi­nese city of Zhengzhou.</p>
    <p>While the Covid-19 out­break has ham­mered the global econ­omy and dis­rupted sup­ply chains, Ap­ple is see­ing strong de­mand for iPhones, iPads and Mac com­put­ers from peo­ple work­ing and study­ing re­motely. Rev­enue from iPhones crushed Wall Street ex­pec­ta­tions in the most re­cent quar­ter. The de­vice still gen­er­ates al­most half of Ap­ple’s sales. Ap­ple shares have soared 76 per cent this year, mak­ing it the first United States com­pany to sur­pass US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) in mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>The four new phones will be split into two ba­sic and two high­end mod­els for the first time, and all will fea­ture Oled dis­plays with im­proved colour and clar­ity.</p>
    <p>The two reg­u­lar iPhones will come in a new 5.4-inch size and a 6.1-inch op­tion, while the Pro de­vices will of­fer a choice of a 6.1-inch or an en­larged 6.7-inch dis­play, which will be the largest Ap­ple has ever put in an iPhone.</p>
    <p>All of the new smart­phones will have up­dated de­signs with squared edges sim­i­lar to the iPad Pro, and the high-end phones will con­tinue to use stain­less steel edges ver­sus alu­minium sides on the cheaper vari­ants. The com­pany is also plan­ning a dark blue colour op­tion on the Pro mod­els to re­place the Mid­night Green of last year’s iPhone 11 Pro line.</p>
    <p>At least the larger of the Pro phones will have the same Lidar cam­era as on the lat­est iPad Pro, which al­lows aug­mented-re­al­ity apps to have a greater un­der­stand­ing of their sur­round­ing en­vi­ron­ment. Among the most sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ments of the new hand­sets will be the new A14 pro­ces­sor, up­grad­ing speed and power ef­fi­ciency. Ap­ple plans to ship the lower-end phones sooner than the Pro de­vices, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the stag­gered re­lease strat­egy.</p>
    <p>The de­sign of this year’s iPhones and many fea­tures were fin­ished be­fore Covid-19 spread, but the pan­demic did cre­ate is­sues for fi­nal test­ing and de­layed the start of pro­duc­tion by sev­eral weeks. While the new iPhones will not ship un­til later, Ap­ple’s iOS 14 soft­ware will ar­rive this month, the peo­ple said.</p>
