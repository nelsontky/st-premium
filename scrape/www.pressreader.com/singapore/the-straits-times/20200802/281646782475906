    <p>Covid-19 pa­tients be­ing cared for in com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties (CCFs) are get­ting their vi­tal signs mon­i­tored round the clock us­ing smart track­ing kits that send their data re­motely to doc­tors.</p>
    <p>The Biovi­tals Sen­tinel, de­vel­oped by lo­cal biotech firm Bio­four­mis, comes with a sen­sor de­vice worn on the pa­tient’s up­per arm, record­ing phys­i­o­log­i­cal data from over 20 biomark­ers such as tem­per­a­ture, blood oxy­gena­tion lev­els and res­pi­ra­tory rate.</p>
    <p>From their Web-based dash­board, doc­tors are able to re­ceive real-time in­for­ma­tion on their pa­tients’ vi­tal signs, en­abling them to de­tect any signs of de­te­ri­o­ra­tion early and in­ter­vene quickly.</p>
    <p>Since April, more than 5,000 pa­tients at CCFs and Swab Iso­la­tion Fa­cil­i­ties (SIFs) who were iden­ti­fied as hav­ing mod­er­ate to high risk of de­vel­op­ing com­pli­ca­tions and re­quired con­tin­u­ous mon­i­tor­ing have used the ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence kit as part of the re­mote mon­i­tor­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>About 2,500 kits have been pro­cured by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) since April.</p>
    <p>This is part of broader ef­forts to use tech­nol­ogy as a “force mul­ti­plier” to get the same or bet­ter out­comes for pa­tients us­ing less time and fewer re­sources, said MOH.</p>
    <p>CCFs were set up at places such as Big Box shop­ping mall in Jurong East, Sin­ga­pore Expo, Changi Ex­hi­bi­tion Centre and D’Re­sort NTUC in Pasir Ris to treat those with milder Covid-19 symp­toms so that hos­pi­tal beds could be freed up for sicker pa­tients.</p>
    <p>SIFs are used for sus­pected Covid-19 cases await­ing their swab test re­sults.</p>
    <p>Once clin­i­cians have as­cer­tained the pa­tients are no longer at risk, they will be re­moved from the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients are given a smart­phone with an app to record their symp­toms and re­motely com­mu­ni­cate with the Bio­four­mis’ support team in case they face tech­ni­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuldeep Singh, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Bio­four­mis, said: “A clin­i­cal trial of the de­vice was con­ducted in March as part of a part­ner­ship with the Uni­ver­sity of Hong Kong, which showed that the Biovi­tals Sen­tinel was able to de­tect wors­en­ing in Covid-19 cases al­most 21 hours in ad­vance of de­te­ri­o­ra­tion.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a drop in the pa­tient’s oxy­gen level would send an alert to clin­i­cians, prompt­ing them to pro­vide more breath­ing support. Rapidly wors­en­ing cases can also be quickly iden­ti­fied and di­verted to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to re­duce un­nec­es­sary false alarms, the data takes into ac­count con­tex­tual in­for­ma­tion such as vari­a­tions in the pa­tient’s heart rate dur­ing sleep and his phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity, which is highly spe­cific to him,” said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with rou­tinely check­ing the pa­tient’s tem­per­a­ture, blood pres­sure and heart rate, the con­tin­u­ous set of data collected of­fers a more ro­bust, per­son­alised and ac­cu­rate set of in­for­ma­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>After assess­ing and eval­u­at­ing sev­eral vi­tal signs mon­i­tor­ing (VSM) so­lu­tions in April, MOH awarded the con­tract to Bio­four­mis “to pro­vide con­tin­u­ous VSM tele­mon­i­tor­ing as it met the health­care re­quire­ments and had the re­sources to im­ple­ment the sys­tem at short no­tice”.</p>
    <p>Bio­four­mis’ VSM so­lu­tion has been on trial at the Sin­ga­pore Expo CCF since end-April, work­ing in tan­dem with the In­te­grated Health In­for­ma­tion Sys­tems’ VSM so­lu­tion. Since mid-May, Bio­four­mis’ VSM so­lu­tion has also been pro­gres­sively rolled out at var­i­ous SIFs. Other VSM tele­mon­i­tor­ing so­lu­tions are also be­ing de­ployed at other CCFs, added MOH.</p>
