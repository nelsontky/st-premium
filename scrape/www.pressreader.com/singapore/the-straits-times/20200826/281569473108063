    <p>The in­sur­ance in­dus­try is still see­ing strong de­mand for cer­tain prod­ucts de­spite the eco­nomic down­turn. This comes as the fi­nance and in­sur­ance sec­tor is pro­jected to ex­pand this year, bucking the gen­eral eco­nomic malaise. In­sur­ers told The Straits Times they have sold more plans with lower pre­mi­ums and shorter terms, as well as in­vest­ment-linked poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The in­sur­ance in­dus­try is still see­ing strong de­mand for cer­tain prod­ucts de­spite the eco­nomic down­turn. This comes as the fi­nance and in­sur­ance sec­tor is pro­jected to ex­pand this year, bucking the gen­eral eco­nomic malaise.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ers told The Straits Times they have sold more plans with lower pre­mi­ums and shorter terms, as well as i nvest­mentlinked poli­cies.</p>
    <p>In the first half of this year, AIA Sin­ga­pore saw a 44 per cent yearon-year in­crease in sales of its AIA Power Crit­i­cal Cover plan, which cov­ers multi-stage crit­i­cal ill­nesses and re­lapse, among other things.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic has re­sulted in Sin­ga­pore­ans be­com­ing more aware of pro­tect­ing them­selves and their loved ones in the event of crit­i­cal ill­ness, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and death,” said Ms Tay Jin Li, head of prod­uct and funds devel­op­ment, im­ple­men­ta­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion at AIA Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The in­surer’s sales of sin­gle-pre­mium in­vest­ment-linked plans spiked 150 per cent. With sin­glepremium poli­cies, cus­tomers make a one-time pay­ment in re­turn for cer­tain guar­an­teed and non-guar­an­teed ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent eco­nomic out­look has re­sulted in a down­turn in the in­vest­ment mar­ket. Some cus­tomers have pur­chased sin­gle-pre­mium in­vest­ment-linked prod­ucts, which are now avail­able at a lower unit price, in an­tic­i­pa­tion of higher po­ten­tial gains when the mar­ket re­cov­ers,” added Ms Tay.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore’s head of prod­uct man­age­ment Stan­ley Ng said pro­tec­tion so­lu­tions, in­vest­ment-linked prod­ucts and “prod­ucts that are bite-size with lower en­try-level pre­mi­ums” are in de­mand. “Given the cur­rent un­cer­tain eco­nomic out­look, these prod­ucts are well re­ceived by cus­tomers who are look­ing for more af­ford­able in­sur­ance cov­er­age,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Aviva Sin­ga­pore said it saw a 19 per cent in­crease in new sales of pro­tec­tion prod­ucts and a 23 per cent in­crease in sales of its sin­gle-pre­mium prod­ucts, such as its sav­ings plans MyLifeIn­come and MySe­cureSaver II.</p>
    <p>Great East­ern also said it saw higher de­mand for its pro­tec­tion­re­lated in­sur­ance so­lu­tions, such as its per­sonal ac­ci­dent plans and term plans, and in­vest­ment-linked plans, but did not pro­vide fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Tokio Marine Life In­sur­ance Sin­ga­pore saw a 27 per cent in­crease in up­take of its term pro­tec­tion plans.</p>
    <p>With­out giv­ing fig­ures, NTUC In­come too said it ob­served greater in­ter­est in shorter-term plans.</p>
    <p>Al­though the pan­demic has raised aware­ness of the need for ad­e­quate in­sur­ance cov­er­age, the slug­gish eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment could be a fac­tor caus­ing many peo­ple to hold back from mak­ing longterm fi­nan­cial com­mit­ments, said NTUC In­come chief agency of­fi­cer Tan Chuan How.</p>
    <p>The Gen­eral In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (GIA) chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Kai Weng said: “While we see lower ac­tiv­ity in seg­ments like travel, the on­go­ing pan­demic is also driv­ing de­mand for pro­tec­tion in se­lect seg­ments, such as cy­ber in­sur­ance and work-from-home in­sur­ance.”</p>
    <p>Great East­ern, for in­stance, said it saw stronger de­mand for its HomeGR8 Plus plan that cov­ers ac­ci­den­tal loss or dam­age to build­ing, ren­o­va­tion and home con­tents.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, travel in­sur­ance was un­sur­pris­ingly af­fected.</p>
    <p>AIA Sin­ga­pore also saw an es­ti­mated 45 per cent fall in de­mand for prod­ucts in its high-net-worth cat­e­gory, which cov­ers ar­eas such as legacy plan­ning and es­tate liq­uid­ity, as con­sumers are more mind­ful about spend­ing, and travel restric­tions re­sulted in a de­crease in such poli­cies sold to over­seas cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Asked about the out­look, GIA’s Mr Ho said the in­sur­ance in­dus­try is un­der­go­ing sig­nif­i­cant changes not only be­cause of the global health cri­sis, but also due to the ac­cel­er­a­tion of dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and au­to­ma­tion. These trends are driv­ing new roles in the in­dus­try, such as in data an­a­lyt­ics, he added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, em­ploy­ment in the life in­sur­ance in­dus­try rose in the first half of the year by 4 per cent year on year with 368 new hires, reach­ing a work­force of 8,650 em­ploy­ees as of end-June.</p>
    <p>The Life In­sur­ance As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore told ST that most of the new hires are sup­port­ing dis­tri­bu­tion and sales teams. There has also been an in­crease in hir­ing for project and prod­uct man­age­ment roles, and an on­go­ing need for more dig­i­tal spe­cial­ists, as in­sur­ers ac­cel­er­ate their dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion plans, it said.</p>
    <p>Aviva Sin­ga­pore is among the in­sur­ers that have un­der­gone dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion re­cently. It said it has con­ducted dig­i­tal train­ing classes for its ad­vis­ers and equipped them with a fi­nan­cial needs anal­y­sis dig­i­tal tool, among other mea­sures. “These new tools have made Aviva’s sales process 100 per cent dig­i­tal and we have also seen an uptick in non-face-to­face sales,” it said.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh Jia Jing, 24, a fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant with Ad­vi­sors Al­liance Group, has found it eas­ier to meet more clients a week now that they are mostly work­ing from home and able to meet vir­tu­ally. She has 12 to 15 ap­point­ments in a week, up from 10 to 12 be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh, who mainly dis­cusses in­sur­ance and in­vest­ment plans with clients in these meet­ings, said: “At­ten­tion spans are shorter on­line and we can’t build as much rap­port over the screen. The key is to de­liver the im­por­tant point while keep­ing them en­gaged in the whole con­ver­sa­tion.”</p>
