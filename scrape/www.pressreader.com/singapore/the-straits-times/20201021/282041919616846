    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) un­der­grad­u­ate who took voyeuris­tic videos of women in stu­dent dor­mi­tory show­ers was sen­tenced to 12 weeks’ jail and fined $1,500 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Joel Ra­sis Is­mail had ear­lier pleaded guilty to three charges of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty and one of crim­i­nal tres­pass. An­other seven sim­i­lar charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old filmed the vic­tims be­tween March and May last year in Raf­fles Hall, in the toi­let of a “fe­male-only” floor that is barred to males.</p>
    <p>It hap­pened in the midst of a pub­lic up­roar about sex­ual mis­con­duct in uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>In April last year, NUS stu­dent Mon­ica Baey had com­plained of in­ac­tion in her case af­ter an­other male stu­dent took voyeuris­tic videos of her in 2018. The male stu­dent was later served a con­di­tional warn­ing by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments showed that Joel, who has been sus­pended by NUS, had ini­tially gone to the toi­let to re­lieve him­self.</p>
    <p>While there, he placed his mo­bile phone in the gap be­tween the cu­bi­cle par­ti­tion and toi­let floor to record the women.</p>
    <p>He did this four times and was even­tu­ally caught in May, af­ter try­ing to film a school­mate in the shower.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had iden­ti­fied him from closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, it emerged that Joel had taken two up­skirt videos of a col­league at work dur­ing an in­tern­ship in 2016.</p>
    <p>He had also taken up­skirt videos of two un­known women at an es­ca­la­tor near Tan­jong Pa­gar MRT sta</p>
    <p>tion that year.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the hear­ing, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor An­dre Ong ar­gued for 12 weeks’ jail and a $1,500 fine, not­ing that the dom­i­nant sen­tenc­ing prin­ci­ples here should be of gen­eral and spe­cific de­ter­rence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Joel’s de­fence lawyer Mal­colm Tan said the stu­dent com­mit­ted the 2019 of­fences in a “mis­guided at­tempt to boost his flag­ging li­bido”.</p>
    <p>He claimed to have night­mares and flash­backs of a bad re­la­tion­ship in 2015, which caused him to suf­fer from re­ac­tive de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan also said Joel was “gen­uinely re­morse­ful” and “ex­tremely co­op­er­a­tive” with the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>District Judge Adam Nakhoda noted that Joel had not been suf­fer­ing from any sig­nif­i­cant symp­toms of anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion at the time of his of­fences.</p>
    <p>The judge said his rea­son for the of­fences is also “com­pletely un­ac­cept­able”, adding that Joel’s ac­tions had been pur­pose­ful and de­lib­er­ate.</p>
    <p>His of­fend­ing con­duct had also es­ca­lated, said the judge, not­ing that he had moved from shoot­ing up­skirt videos to tres­pass­ing in or­der to shoot the voyeuris­tic videos.</p>
    <p>There was a “high de­gree of in­tru­sion” into his vic­tims’ pri­vacy, said Judge Nakhoda, adding that his vic­tims were en­ti­tled to feel safe in the shower in a fe­male-only toi­let, on a fe­male-only floor.</p>
