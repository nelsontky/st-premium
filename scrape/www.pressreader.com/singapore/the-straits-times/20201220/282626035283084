    <p>Media an­a­lyst Tham Jiang Jun, 26, is so pas­sion­ate about pod­cast­ing that he has even cre­ated an hour­long train­ing video teach­ing oth­ers how to start a pod­cast.</p>
    <p>Since start­ing #TheLearn­ingPod­cast in Septem­ber last year, he has recorded about 55 episodes which can be streamed on Spo­tify, Ap­ple Pod­cast and Google Pod­casts. He also up­loads videos onto YouTube.</p>
    <p>In each episode, he in­ter­views a guest – sourced from among his friends and via LinkedIn – on his ca­reer jour­ney, so both he and his lis­ten­ers can learn from this guest.</p>
    <p>“It’s easy for peo­ple to give quick bite-size life ad­vice... but I learn best through im­mers­ing my­self in their shoes to em­pathise with their strug­gles, chal­lenges and vic­to­ries. If there are other peo­ple like me out there, they could join the jour­ney to learn with me,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tham has in­vested more than $1,500 in the set-up for his pod­cast, which he pro­duces at his par­ents’ apart­ment, with 80 per cent of the cost go­ing to DSLR cam­eras.</p>
    <p>He said his favourite ca­reer tip – to net­work – came from for­mer MP Zainal Sa­pari, who was a guest ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>While Mr Tham has re­ceived some neg­a­tive feed­back from peo­ple about his pod­cast be­ing a waste of time, he has also re­ceived “thank you” mes­sages from peo­ple who were con­sid­er­ing be­ing lawyers, data an­a­lysts, HR con­sul­tants and en­trepreneur­s – all of whom he has made pod­casts about. They said they gained more clar­ity about what they wanted af­ter lis­ten­ing to the pod­casts.</p>
    <p>An­other pod­cast fea­tur­ing the sto­ries be­hind lo­cal en­trepreneur­s’ suc­cesses was launched this year by lo­cal start-up Open Cir­cles. EP!C Pod­cast is part of a wider pro­gramme to nur­ture young en­trepreneur­s into cu­rat­ing their own uni­corn start-ups, pro­duced in part­ner­ship with the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The core pod­cast team com­prises Open Cir­cles chief ex­ec­u­tive</p>
    <p>Joshua Yap, 26, pro­ject lead Joel Ang, 25, com­mu­nity lead Car­dinia Gla­dyandza, 22, con­tent lead Ariel Yap, 22, and cre­ative lead Liam Mariz Pineda, 24.</p>
    <p>Apart from Mr Yap, the rest are all full-time univer­sity stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Ms Gla­dyandza said that in each 20- to 30-minute episode, speak­ers – in­clud­ing Razer co-founder Tan Min-Liang and Ms Vir­ginia Tan, co-founder of global start-up com­pe­ti­tion She Loves Tech – are quizzed on what they would have done dif­fer­ently in their jour­neys if given the chance.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap added that the pod­cast is aimed at young en­trepreneur­s be­tween the ages of 18 and 25, who are mainly at an early ideation or seed stage. “The most mem­o­rable mis­takes made by our speak­ers are usu­ally at this stage. Also, at this young stage, the chal­lenges en­trepreneur­s face are rel­a­tively sim­i­lar and are the eas­i­est to learn from,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing learn­ing easy was also the aim of the team at per­sonal fi­nance plat­form The Sim­ple Sum who launched the Keep It Sim­ple pod­cast in March. It has been streamed over 16,000 times.</p>
    <p>Ms Shirley Crys­tal Chua, 41, The Sim­ple Sum founder and group chief ex­ec­u­tive of its hold­ing group Golden Equa­tor, said it is tar­geted at nor­mal­is­ing con­ver­sa­tions about per­sonal fi­nance and money among mil­len­ni­als and Gen­er­a­tion Z.</p>
    <p>The pod­cast, pro­duced by The Sim­ple Sum dig­i­tal con­tent ex­ec­u­tive Sophia Pe­tra Lee, 25, and co­hosted by its graphic il­lus­tra­tor Priscilla Lam, 26, dis­cusses top­ics such as start­ing salaries, how to ask for a raise, and high­lights peo­ple with in­ter­est­ing ca­reers, in­clud­ing free­lancers.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Chua: “For life skills such as per­sonal fi­nance, un­for­tu­nately, this isn’t some­thing taught in school at a prac­ti­cal level de­spite its im­por­tance, and we hope to equip our younger gen­er­a­tion with th­ese skills as early as pos­si­ble so that they get to have hand­son prac­tice and get bet­ter at it as they progress in life.”</p>
