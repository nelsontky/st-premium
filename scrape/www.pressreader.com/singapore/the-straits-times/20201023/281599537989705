    <p>Busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore have seen a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in cy­ber se­cu­rity chal­lenges as more peo­ple work from home amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by Cisco has re­vealed. About six in 10 or­gan­i­sa­tions here said they have ex­pe­ri­enced at least a 25 per cent in­crease in cy­ber threats since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore have seen a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in cy­ber se­cu­rity chal­lenges as more peo­ple work from home amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by Amer­i­can tech gi­ant Cisco has re­vealed.</p>
    <p>Of the nearly 3,200 com­pa­nies from 21 coun­tries polled in the sur­vey from June 16 to Sept 4, Sin­ga­pore made the largest shift to re­mote work­ing in Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>About six in 10 or­gan­i­sa­tions here said they have ex­pe­ri­enced at least a 25 per cent in­crease in cy­ber threats since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>These threats in­cluded con­nec­tions to ma­li­cious sites on the In­ter­net and phish­ing at­tacks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, less than half, or 42 per cent of com­pa­nies, said that they were “very pre­pared” to cope with these threats and tran­si­tion to work­ing re­motely.</p>
    <p>Around half, or 54 per cent of com­pa­nies, in­di­cated that they were “some­what pre­pared”, while three per cent said they were “not pre­pared” for the tran­si­tion. The re­main­ing one per cent said they did not know whether they were pre­pared for it.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, con­ducted by lo­cal public opin­ion and data com­pany YouGov, gath­ered data from 3,196 com­pa­nies across 21 coun­tries in­clud­ing the United States, China and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>It showed that Sin­ga­pore made the largest shift to re­mote work­ing in Asia-Pa­cific, with a 59 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of or­gan­i­sa­tions here hav­ing more than half of their em­ploy­ees work­ing re­motely, com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This in­crease is the sec­ond-high­est glob­ally, after Bri­tain, show­ing that more peo­ple are con­nect­ing to their cor­po­rate net­work from out­side tra­di­tional of­fices.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of this shift, 58 per cent of com­pa­nies here said main­tain­ing con­trol of se­cu­rity de­vices and poli­cies emerged as the top cy­ber se­cu­rity chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>En­sur­ing se­cure ac­cess – which is the abil­ity to ver­ify the iden­tity of the worker re­gard­less of where or when he logs in to the net­work – was cited as the sec­ond-big­gest chal­lenge by 56 per cent of com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Other chal­lenges in­cluded a lack of em­ployee aware­ness on cy­ber se­cu­rity pro­to­cols and adapt­ing to a change in com­pany cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Hy­brid work­places, where em­ploy­ees move be­tween work­ing re­motely and in the of­fice, are be­com­ing more pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Forty per cent of or­gan­i­sa­tions here said they ex­pect more than half their em­ploy­ees to con­tinue work­ing re­motely even after the pan­demic has been brought un­der con­trol. Only 18 per cent of or­gan­i­sa­tions had this ar­range­ment be­fore the out­break.</p>
    <p>With more com­pa­nies gear­ing up for more flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments, 89 per cent said cy­ber se­cu­rity is their top cor­po­rate pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Around three in four com­pa­nies, or 76 per cent, plan to in­crease their in­vest­ment in cy­ber se­cu­rity poli­cies to sup­port re­mote work­ing.</p>
