    <p>At the start of the Covid-19 out­break, health­care pro­fes­sion­als and pol­i­cy­mak­ers were stumped on many fronts. A key ques­tion was how the coro­n­avirus had spread from hu­man to hu­man.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers like Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tham Kwok Wai leapt into ac­tion, tap­ping their pre­vi­ous work.</p>
    <p>Prof Tham, who had re­searched the spread of viruses such as in­fluenza i n an i ndoor set­ting, found that the in­door en­vi­ron­ment was also a pri­mary do­main for trans­mis­sion of the virus that causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of his pre­vi­ous re­search, he knew there were mea­sures that could con­trol its spread in­doors. For in­stance, in­creas­ing ven­ti­la­tion of a room will help to di­lute the con­cen­tra­tion of the virus in the air, re­duc­ing trans­mis­sion risk. Safe dis­tanc­ing also works, as the vi­ral load di­min­ishes with dis­tance from the in­fected per­son, he said.</p>
    <p>Pass­ing re-cir­cu­lat­ing air through high ef­fi­ciency fil­ters can help to re­move viruses that usu­ally “clump” to­gether, said the pro­fes­sor from the NUS School of De­sign and En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19, Prof Tham’s re­search had fo­cused on the im­pact of the in­door en­vi­ron­ment on hu­mans, and on cool­ing and ven­ti­la­tion tech­nolo­gies for in­door en­vi­ron­men­tal con­trol.</p>
    <p>“I be­gan to see how I could ap­ply my re­search on en­vi­ron­men­tal in­ter­ven­tion to Covid-19 at the on­set of the pan­demic, around De­cem­ber 2019,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Tham said tack­ling the out­break re­quires re­searchers with var­i­ous ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>Other than vi­rol­ogy, for i nstance, knowl­edge in aerosol sci­ence or fluid me­chan­ics could also help with bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of how ex­pelled droplets could spread.</p>
    <p>Prof Tham said: “This demon­strates how a trans-dis­ci­plinary ap­proach is es­sen­tial in tack­ling the Covid-19 chal­lenge holis­ti­cally. And this con­sti­tutes the ba­sis for pol­icy for­mu­la­tion.”</p>
