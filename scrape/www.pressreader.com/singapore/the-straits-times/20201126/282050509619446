    <p>There are new waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tions hit­ting many other coun­tries, and we in Sin­ga­pore should count our bless­ings that the case count here is rel­a­tively low.</p>
    <p>This is, of course, due to the part played by ev­ery­one to keep Sin­ga­pore safe.</p>
    <p>When I vis­ited Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3 with my fam­ily last Saturday even­ing, we were shocked that peo­ple could just walk straight into the mall from the base­ment level two carpark.</p>
    <p>There was no bar­ri­cade or per­son­nel to en­sure that ev­ery­one had checked in with SafeEn­try and that they had their tem­per­a­tures taken be­fore en­try.</p>
    <p>There were big crowds at the Changi Fes­tive Vil­lage, mostly con­cen­trated at the ex­hibits, and at the toki­doki at­trac­tions. I did not no­tice any safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors manag­ing the crowd.</p>
    <p>Any­one could also walk about the ar­rival hall, mix­ing with trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Are we get­ting so com­pla­cent that the mea­sures were re­laxed at T3?</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val will run till Jan­uary and many par­ents will take their chil­dren there dur­ing the school hol­i­days. I dread to think what would hap­pen should any virus clus­ter form there.</p>
