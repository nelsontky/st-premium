    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion (IFC) is re­spond­ing to the Covid-19 cri­sis with what Mr Al­fonso Gar­cia Mora, its vice-pres­i­dent for the Asia-Pa­cific, calls “the three Rs” – re­lief, re­struc­tur­ing and re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>By way of re­lief, it has pro­vided US$8 bil­lion (S$10.7 bil­lion) for work­ing cap­i­tal liq­uid­ity to firms in coun­tries whose cen­tral banks were not able to come up with enough liq­uid­ity sup­port. It also ex­tended US$4 bil­lion in fi­nanc­ing for health, in­clud­ing sup­port for coun­tries to de­velop and dis­trib­ute vac­cines, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>It is also help­ing many of its client com­pa­nies to re­struc­ture their busi­nesses for a changed world and is work­ing with banks to re­solve non-per­form­ing loans and take them off their books, to un­lock fresh lend­ing.</p>
    <p>The IFC wants to pro­mote “a re­silient re­cov­ery”. This will in­volve sev­eral el­e­ments, ac­cord­ing to Mr Gar­cia Mora.</p>
    <p>A cru­cial step will be to ex­pand dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity. “There are about 3.5 bil­lion peo­ple in the world who are still off­line,” he pointed out, which means they can­not ben­e­fit from ris­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In many poor coun­tries, only one out of 25 jobs can be done from home. “This pan­demic is a cri­sis of in­equal­ity, which has in­creased sig­nif­i­cantly across coun­tries, so­cial classes and gen­ders. Women have suf­fered 1.8 times as many job losses as men,” said Mr Gar­cia Mora.</p>
    <p>The World Bank group has launched a Dig­i­tal De­vel­op­ment Part­ner­ship to work with the pri­vate sec­tor to pro­mote dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion in the de­vel­op­ing world. Google and Mi­crosoft are among the com­pa­nies that have signed up as part­ners.</p>
    <p>A re­silient re­cov­ery will also in­volve help­ing firms to ac­cess green fi­nance and blue bonds (which raise funds for ocean-friendly projects), and build green in­fra­struc­ture. These are ar­eas where the IFC will be re­dou­bling its ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, its par­ent, the World Bank group, raised its com­mit­ment to cli­mate-re­lated lend­ing to 35 per cent of lend­ing op­er­a­tions, from 28 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is crit­i­cal to the IFC’s Asian op­er­a­tions. It has the largest pres­ence among all in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions here, with more than 150 staff, who work on coun­tries rang­ing from Afghanista­n to the Pa­cific Is­lands.</p>
    <p>“For us, Sin­ga­pore is a vi­tal knowl­edge hub for dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, fin­tech and cli­mate-re­lated is­sues,” said Mr Gar­cia Mora. “It is also a hub for in­fra­struc­ture fi­nanc­ing. We are mo­bil­is­ing pri­vate cap­i­tal from Sin­ga­pore. We want to help Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies go over­seas, where we can iden­tify good op­por­tu­ni­ties and co-in­vest with them.”</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has opened up many new op­por­tu­ni­ties for com­pa­nies in Asia, he added.</p>
