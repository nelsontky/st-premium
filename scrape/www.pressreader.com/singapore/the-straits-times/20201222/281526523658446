    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Open has been sched­uled for April 13-18 as a qual­i­fier for the Tokyo Olympics, the Bad­minton World Fed­er­a­tion said yes­ter­day. This year’s edi­tion was can­celled af­ter the gov­ern­ing body sus­pended all events in March ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In what is an­other sign that the world of sports is grad­u­ally com­ing back to life, the Bad­minton World Fed­er­a­tion (BWF) yes­ter­day an­nounced its tour­na­ment cal­en­dar for the first half of next year, with the Sin­ga­pore Open sched­uled for April 13-18 as a qual­i­fier for the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>In March, the BWF sus­pended all sanc­tioned tour­na­ments this year, in­clud­ing the Sin­ga­pore Open, and froze the Olympic qual­i­fi­ca­tion and world rank­ings due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Nine of the world’s top 10 men’s sin­gles shut­tlers, in­clud­ing reign­ing Olympic cham­pion Chen Long, as well as all of the top 10 women’s play­ers, had been con­firmed for the US$408,000 (S$546,000) Sin­ga­pore Open.</p>
    <p>In last year’s edi­tion, 4,962 spec­ta­tors turned up at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium to watch Kento Mo­mota and Tai Tzu-ying win the men’s and women’s sin­gles re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The 2021 sea­son will be­gin with the Thai­land Open from Jan 12-17, with the qual­i­fiers for the July 23-Aug 8 Olympics restart­ing on March 2 at the Swiss Open.</p>
    <p>BWF sec­re­tary gen­eral Thomas Lund said: “The fo­cus has been to es­tab­lish clus­ter tour­na­ments where pos­si­ble, sim­i­lar to what is planned for the Asian Leg in Jan­uary in Thai­land and we ex­pect to stage a num­ber of tour­na­ments this way to en­sure a more fea­si­ble tour­na­ment pro­gramme in 2021.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion con­tin­ues to pro­vide a chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment to run in­ter­na­tional tour­na­ments, and although the hope is that the Covid-19 vac­cine may in time cre­ate a world with fewer re­stric­tions, BWF ex­pects that the pan­demic will still in­flu­ence tour­na­ment host­ing through­out the whole of 2021.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Bad­minton As­so­ci­a­tion told The Straits Times it is work­ing closely with Sport Sin­ga­pore and BWF to fi­nalise ar­range­ments for the Sin­ga­pore Open.</p>
    <p>It added they will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the pan­demic and as­sess its im­pact on the event.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s top shut­tlers Loh Kean Yew and Yeo Jia Min are itch­ing to get back on court.</p>
    <p>Men’s sin­gles world No. 38 Loh said: “Con­sid­er­ing how we were un­able to com­pete in most tour­na­ments this year due to Covid-19, I’m def­i­nitely ex­cited to re­turn to play in tour­na­ments when they re­sume next year.</p>
    <p>“If con­di­tions al­low the Sin­ga­pore Open to take place, it would be great be­cause I’ve al­ways en­joyed play­ing on home ground, which makes it a dif­fer­ent and ex­cit­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Women’s sin­gles world No. 26 Yeo added: “Be­ing able to com­pete abroad is the key to main­tain­ing our sharp­ness on court. I’m look­ing for­ward to be­ing able to par­tic­i­pate in more tour­na­ments if the virus sit­u­a­tion eases. It is al­ways a joy to com­pete in the Sin­ga­pore Open, in my home coun­try, and I’m look­ing for­ward to it.”</p>
    <p>The BWF also an­nounced a Covid-19 sup­port pack­age for hosts, pro­vid­ing fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance and cost re­lief ini­tia­tives to en­sure tour­na­ments can con­tinue to be part of the BWF World Tour next year.</p>
    <p>Lund added: “The sup­port will help hosts cover the costs of im­ple­ment­ing BWF Covid-19 pro­to­cols which in­clude test­ing, ar­range­ments around ho­tel safety, clean­ing, pro­vi­sions of masks to par­tic­i­pants, and sani­tis­ing equip­ment.</p>
    <p>“There is also the pos­sibil­ity to re­duce to­tal min­i­mum prize money for 2021 in the ef­fort to re­duce costs, but BWF would en­cour­age all hosts to keep min­i­mum prize money lev­els as high as pos­si­ble for the ben­e­fit of our top play­ers.”</p>
