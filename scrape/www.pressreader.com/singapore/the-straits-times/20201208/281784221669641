    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysian en­ergy gi­ant Petronas said yes­ter­day that it has agreed to a com­mer­cial set­tle­ment that grants Sarawak state a higher share of rev­enue for oil and gas pro­duced in the state.</p>
    <p>Un­der the agree­ment, Sarawak state will also be given more ac­tive in­volve­ment in the state’s oil and gas in­dus­try through man­age­ment of on­shore oil and gas re­sources via its state-owned en­ergy firm Pet­ros, ac­cord­ing to a joint state­ment by Petronas and the state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Both Petronas and the state gov­ern­ment said they re­mained com­mit­ted to pro­vid­ing a “sta­ble, con­ducive business and in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment for the sus­tain­able growth of the oil and gas in­dus­try” in the state.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Petronas paid over US$700 mil­lion (S$937 mil­lion) i n sales tax to Sarawak, months af­ter both par­ties agreed to an out-of-court set­tle­ment over a le­gal chal­lenge by the state for a higher sales tax pay­out.</p>
    <p>The deal led to the res­ig­na­tion of Petronas chief executive Wan Zulk­i­flee Wan Arif­fin, who quit af­ter a dis­agree­ment with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin over giv­ing more oil money to Sarawak state, ac­cord­ing to sources.</p>
    <p>Sarawak is gov­erned by a key po­lit­i­cal ally of Tan Sri Muhyid­din, who has grap­pled with a ra­zor-thin par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity since tak­ing power in March.</p>
    <p>Sarawak’s rul­ing coalition Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak con­trib­utes 18 seats in the fed­eral Par­lia­ment to Mr Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional al­liance that gov­erns Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Malaysia said yes­ter­day it has no in­ten­tion of rein­tro­duc­ing the goods and ser­vices tax (GST) to shore up gov­ern­ment cof­fers.</p>
    <p>“Rein­tro­duc­ing the GST is not among the lat­est op­tions as we are look­ing at all op­tions avail­able,” said Deputy Fi­nance Min­is­ter II Mohd Sha­har Ab­dul­lah in re­sponse to a ques­tion in Par­lia­ment on the is­sue. He said the min­istry is fo­cus­ing on tak­ing care of the peo­ple’s health, and en­sur­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery and re­silience.</p>
    <p>He added that the gov­ern­ment is fo­cus­ing on im­prov­ing gov­er­nance and has set up a multi-agency task force to bet­ter man­age its fi­nances while plug­ging leak­ages.</p>
    <p>The 6 per cent GST was in­tro­duced in April 2015 but was abol­ished by the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ad­min­is­tra­tion in 2018. In its place, PH rolled out the sales and ser­vice tax in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
