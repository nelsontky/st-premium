    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) has started tri­als of a new ser­vice that will al­low for quicker ver­i­fi­ca­tion of Covid-19 test re­sults, po­ten­tially paving the way for the in­tro­duc­tion of vac­cine pass­ports.</p>
    <p>In­stead of check­ing health cer­tifi­cates man­u­ally for their au­then­tic­ity, im­mi­gra­tion staff will scan a QR code us­ing an app de­vel­oped by a Te­masek-linked tech­nol­ogy firm.</p>
    <p>This will shorten the time needed for trav­ellers to clear im­mi­gra­tion and will i mprove their travel ex­pe­ri­ence amid the pan­demic, said the air­line yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The new ser­vice is com­ing ahead of the ex­pected in­tro­duc­tion of vac­cine-re­lated travel rules by avi­a­tion au­thor­i­ties world­wide.</p>
    <p>SIA worked with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata) on the new ser­vice as part of a push to in­tro­duce in­dus­try­wide stan­dards in the re­open­ing of bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Ms JoAnn Tan, SIA’s act­ing se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for mar­ket­ing plan­ning, said: “Covid-19 tests and vac­ci­na­tions will be an in­te­gral part of air travel for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“We are of­fer­ing a dig­i­tal so­lu­tion that al­lows the easy and se­cure ver­i­fi­ca­tion of this in­for­ma­tion, and sup­ports the in­dus­try’s safe and cal­i­brated re­cov­ery from this pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>In a Facebook post, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said his min­istry and the Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore will sup­port the ini­tia­tive to help make it a re­gional or in­ter­na­tional prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, most trav­ellers fly­ing into Sin­ga­pore have to take a Covid-19 test within 72 hours of their flight to prove they are not in­fected.</p>
    <p>The test re­sult must be ob­tained from an ac­cred­ited lab­o­ra­tory, and the ver­i­fi­ca­tion of this re­sult, in­clud­ing checks on the test date, is done man­u­ally by of­fi­cials at Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers on SIA flights from Jakarta or Kuala Lumpur can take ad­van­tage of the new ver­i­fi­ca­tion ser­vice by hav­ing their pre-en­try Covid-19 tests done at se­lected clin­ics in the two cities.</p>
    <p>The clin­ics will is­sue trav­ellers who have neg­a­tive re­sults ei­ther a dig­i­tal or pa­per health cer­tifi­cate dis­play­ing a QR code that ver­i­fies the cer­tifi­cate’s au­then­tic­ity. The code can be scanned by air­port staff and im­mi­gra­tion of­fi­cials us­ing a mo­bile app de­vel­oped by tech­nol­ogy com­pany Affinidi.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, the ver­i­fi­ca­tion ser­vice will be rolled out to SIA’s flights from other cities, with plans to in­te­grate the pass into its mo­bile app from around June next year.</p>
    <p>SIA is the first air­line in the world to set up such a ver­i­fi­ca­tion process based on Iata’s Travel Pass frame­work.</p>
    <p>Iata’s plat­form, which is still be­ing de­vel­oped, is in­tended as an in­ter­na­tional dig­i­tal health pass­port which pro­vides proof that trav­ellers have been tested for or vac­ci­nated against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Health and se­cu­rity ser­vices firm In­ter­na­tional SOS said yes­ter­day that it has also launched a sim­i­lar dig­i­tally ver­i­fi­able health cer­tifi­cate for en­trance into Sin­ga­pore. This was done to­gether with the In­ter­na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce and AOK­Pass.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie from So­bie Avi­a­tion said the in­tro­duc­tion of the new sys­tems alone will not sig­nif­i­cantly speed up re­cov­ery in air travel.</p>
    <p>“For this tech­nol­ogy to help fa­cil­i­tate a re­cov­ery, the in­dus­try still needs gov­ern­ments on both ends of any flight to agree to an air travel bub­ble or a full re­open­ing on a bi­lat­eral ba­sis, and also to mu­tu­ally recog­nise Covid-19 tests and vac­cines,” said Mr So­bie.</p>
