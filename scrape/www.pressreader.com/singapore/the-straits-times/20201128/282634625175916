    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Aus­tralian Open or­gan­is­ers said yes­ter­day that noth­ing re­gard­ing the quar­an­tine for play­ers ar­riv­ing in the coun­try for the Grand Slam had been de­cided yet, de­spite a re­port in lo­cal me­dia that com­peti­tors would be able to train while in self-iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The Age news­pa­per re­ported that the men’s gov­ern­ing body ATP has told the play­ers that they would be al­lowed to train dur­ing their 14-day quar­an­tine pe­riod ahead of the Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>A Ten­nis Aus­tralia (TA) spokesman told Reuters the or­gan­is­ers are still wait­ing for ap­provals from the Vic­to­ria state gov­ern­ment for de­tails on the year’s first Grand Slam, in­clud­ing those re­lat­ing to prac­tice dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers have been in lengthy dis­cus­sions with au­thor­i­ties over the Covid-19 pro­to­cols to be es­tab­lished for those ar­riv­ing in Aus­tralia ahead of the Grand Slam, slated to be held from Jan 18-31.</p>
    <p>State of­fi­cials on Wed­nes­day con­firmed the Mel­bourne Park tour­na­ment would go ahead, though it would likely take place a week or two after the sched­uled start date and that play­ers would have to un­dergo quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Men’s world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic re­cently called on au­thor­i­ties to en­sure play­ers are al­lowed to train dur­ing quar­an­tine, while Rus­sia’s Daniil Medvedev said it would be “dan­ger­ous” to be con­fined to a ho­tel room for two weeks and then go straight into a Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne yes­ter­day com­pleted 28 days since the last re­ported lo­cally ac­quired case of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Due to bor­der re­stric­tions be­tween states and var­ied quar­an­tine re­quire­ments by lo­cal gov­ern­ments in Aus­tralia, TA plans to shift all build-up tour­na­ments for the Grand Slam to Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>The re­port from The Age also said the ATP Cup, the 24-nation men’s event which made its de­but this year in Bris­bane, Perth and Syd­ney as a Grand Slam tune-up, would be can­celled next year but other ATP and WTA l ead-up events would go ahead.</p>
    <p>ATP had no com­ment on the re­port but the gov­ern­ing body is ex­pected to re­lease the 2021 cal­en­dar early next month. TA said a de­ci­sion on the ATP Cup was yet to be taken and or­gan­is­ers would only be able to fi­nalise the lead-up tour­na­ments to the Aus­tralian Open once dates and quar­an­tine de­tails are fi­nalised.</p>
