    <p>De­spite the pan­demic, Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Chng Kai Fong is cau­tiously op­ti­mistic about be­ing able to at­tract good com­pa­nies to in­vest in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It’s not all doom and gloom,” he told re­porters over cof­fee at the Fu­nan Mall on Friday. “We are con­tin­u­ing to cre­ate jobs and to have a good pipe­line of in­vest­ment in­ter­est.”</p>
    <p>Dressed ca­su­ally in a T-shirt, jeans and a base­ball cap, the 42-year-old civil ser­vant would not look out of place among the tech com­pa­nies and start-ups he works with.</p>
    <p>He cited re­cent ex­am­ples of ma­jor multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions (MNCs) that have ex­panded oper­a­tions here: Royal Dutch Shell, which will start a pi­lot project at its Pu­lau Bukom re­fin­ery to im­ple­ment ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing site tech­nol­ogy, and Ja­panese con­struc­tion gi­ant Ka­jima, which just broke ground for its first over­seas in­no­va­tion cen­tre in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The $100 mil­lion Ka­jima Global Hub will also serve as its Asia-Pa­cific head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Chng said some firms, rat­tled by sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions due to Covid-19, are look­ing to di­ver­sify their risk.</p>
    <p>“There are com­pa­nies that have never con­sid­ered Sin­ga­pore be­fore, be­cause they feel we are too ex­pen­sive. But now they re­alise they are over­con­cen­trated in one coun­try.”</p>
    <p>BRIGHT SPOT</p>
    <p>It’s not all doom and gloom. We are con­tin­u­ing to cre­ate jobs and to have a good pipe­line of</p>
    <p>’’ in­vest­ment in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>MR CHNG KAI FONG, Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, on at­tract­ing good com­pa­nies to in­vest here.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s net­work of 25 free trade pacts helps com­pa­nies not just save money from tar­iffs, but also an­chor their man­u­fac­tur­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore and Asean, he said. “To ac­ti­vate some of the FTAs (free trade agree­ments), you need a cer­tain per­cent­age of prod­uct to be pro­duced in Asean,” said Mr Chng.</p>
    <p>But the ul­ti­mate aim is to cre­ate for Sin­ga­pore­ans en­try points into good jobs.</p>
    <p>These jobs, he added, should not be back-end func­tions that can eas­ily be out­sourced to cheaper places.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, if Face­book has ad­ver­tis­ing func­tions here, that cre­ates value. Hav­ing those jobs here cre­ates way more op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“That’s what we are try­ing to con­struct in Sin­ga­pore – an ecosys­tem of dif­fer­ent kinds of jobs, a com­bi­na­tion of MNCs and start-ups that are in the fast-growth phase. That’s how you have an ecosys­tem of tal­ent cir­cu­la­tion and train­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chng stressed that the coun­try must not lose sight of the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing an open pol­icy even as the re­ces­sion bites.</p>
    <p>In the tech sec­tor, for ex­am­ple, not ev­ery Sin­ga­porean starts off know­ing how to design prod­ucts for fast-mov­ing mar­kets that serve bil­lions of peo­ple around the world.</p>
    <p>Us­ing an anal­ogy from the sci­ence fic­tion movie fran­chise Star Wars, Mr Ch­ngˇ sˇaid: “You need the Jedi Masters around, be­cause some of these (heads of com­pa­nies) have in­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to have them, oth­er­wise you’re not go­ing to learn from the best, or be ex­posed to the best.”</p>
    <p>At the en­try level, the padawans – young ap­pren­tices who study un­der Jedi Masters – must be groomed for key lead­er­ship po­si­tions over time, he added.</p>
    <p>“At the en­try Em­ploy­ment Pass level, we have to make sure that the for­eign­ers we bring in do not pre­vent our peo­ple from hav­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“And if those op­por­tu­ni­ties are in the core busi­ness of the com­pany, then that’s where they have the op­por­tu­nity to shine and grow.”</p>
