    <p>It is a very dif­fer­ent Asia that US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will face when he as­sumes of­fice, and the in­com­ing leader of the world su­per­power must be pre­pared to con­sult the re­gion and lis­ten to its views.</p>
    <p>This was the mes­sage that veteran diplo­mat and for­mer Sin­ga­pore am­bas­sador to the United States Chan Heng Chee had for Mr Bi­den and his ad­min­is­tra­tion, which she shared at The Straits Times’ in­au­gu­ral Geopo­lit­i­cal Re­set 2021 we­bi­nar on Thurs­day. Pan­el­lists on the fo­rum in­cluded veteran diplo­mat Tommy Koh, also a for­mer Sin­ga­pore am­bas­sador to the US.</p>
    <p>The t wo di­plo­matic heavy­weights – both am­bas­sadors-at­large with Sin­ga­pore’s For­eign Min­istry but speak­ing in their per­sonal ca­pac­ity – dis­cussed how the US un­der Mr Bi­den is likely to man­age its re­la­tion­ships in Asia in ar­eas in­clud­ing trade, tech­nol­ogy and po­lit­i­cal ide­olo­gies. They were joined by ST’s US bureau chief Nir­mal Ghosh, global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Ben­jamin Kang Lim in Bei­jing, and as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Vikram Khanna.</p>
    <p>“I want to tell Pres­i­dent Bi­den… In the last four years, Asia has changed,” Prof Chan said, adding that Asian na­tions had since de­vel­oped a greater sense of agency. “(Coun­tries in Asia) have taken a lot of ini­tia­tives in the ab­sence of Amer­i­can lead­er­ship. And they (Mr Bi­den’s team) should bear that in mind. So they should come to the re­gion, but should con­sult and lis­ten.”</p>
    <p>Prof Koh urged Mr Bi­den’s team to pri­ori­tise prag­ma­tism over ide­ol­ogy in their poli­cies to­wards Asia, lest they be doomed to fail­ure.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery Amer­i­can ad­min­is­tra­tion… must up­hold the val­ues of democ­racy and hu­man rights. But I hope that in your for­mu­la­tion and ex­e­cu­tion of pol­icy to­wards Asia, you will al­low real­ism, prag­ma­tism and wis­dom to pre­vail over ide­ol­ogy,” he said. “Any at­tempt by the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to di­vide Asia and to form an anti-China coali­tion will fail, and it will not be wel­come.”</p>
    <p>A RE­TURN TO STA­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Both am­bas­sadors agreed that the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will be an improvemen­t for US-Asia ties, ush­er­ing in a pe­riod of greater pre­dictabil­ity, sta­bil­ity, pro­fes­sion­al­ism and struc­ture for the re­gion than it has been un­der Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica un­der Mr Bi­den is set to re-em­brace mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and look to­wards strength­en­ing al­liances, they said, with the Pres­i­dent-elect pledg­ing to re­join the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Paris cli­mate ac­cord, both of which Mr Trump has aban­doned.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den or his Vice-Pres­i­den­t­elect Ka­mala Har­ris might at­tend the next Asean sum­mit, el­e­vat­ing the im­por­tance of the re­gional body and South-east Asia to US pol­icy, as for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama did, Prof Koh said.</p>
    <p>But with re­gard to US-China ties – Amer­ica’s defin­ing re­la­tion­ship in Asia – Mr Bi­den would find it very dif­fi­cult to re­verse the down­ward course, given ex­tremely neg­a­tive opin­ions about China in the US pub­lic and po­lit­i­cal spheres.</p>
    <p>“My own pre­dic­tion is that Bi­den will end Trump’s ‘cold war’ against China, but he will not be able to bring the re­la­tion­ship back to what it was dur­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion,” Prof Koh said. “The ‘cold war’ will be re­placed by a ‘cold peace’... in which the two coun­tries don’t see each other as en­e­mies... but there’s no warmth in the re­la­tion­ship, be­cause there’s a deficit of strate­gic trust.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ghosh agreed: “Bi­den’s ad­vis­ers... are talk­ing about com­pe­ti­tion with­out catas­tro­phe... There is a feel­ing that the US-China com­pe­ti­tion has got­ten out of hand.”</p>
    <p>The Trump-im­posed im­port tar­iffs on China will prob­a­bly come into greater fo­cus in the sec­ond half of next year, but lift­ing them may re­quire “tar­geted rec­i­proc­ity” from China, Prof Chan said.</p>
    <p>COM­PETE ON CA­PA­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Kang opined that if Mr Bi­den halts Wash­ing­ton’s at­tempts to de­cou­ple the US and China economies, Bei­jing might also mod­ify its stance on its own “dual cir­cu­la­tion” pol­icy – a strate­gic, de­fen­sive move to­wards self­suf­fi­ciency in trade and tech­nol­ogy in re­sponse to US ag­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>He said Bei­jing wants an end to the Sino-US “tech war”, in which Mr Trump has im­posed sanc­tions to disrupt Chi­nese tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ment, pur­port­edly over na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The best way for Amer­ica to com­pete with China for global tech supremacy is to strengthen its own re­search ca­pa­bil­ity, Prof Chan said, adding that Mr Bi­den him­self had pre­vi­ously made this point. “The United States has not funded R&D (re­search and de­vel­op­ment) in the way it used to... You (should aim to) beat China be­cause your tech­nol­ogy is su­pe­rior... I think that is the way to go,” said Prof Chan.</p>
    <p>On global trade, Prof Koh said with­draw­ing from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP) – a pro­posed trade pact among 12 coun­tries on both sides of the Pa­cific, ex­clud­ing China – was one of Mr Trump’s big­gest blun­ders.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the US with­drawal, the pact was re­vised to be­come the 11-na­tion Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP) now in ef­fect, but the US is un­likely to re­join it even un­der Mr Bi­den, he said.</p>
    <p>“Amer­i­can politi­cians have suc­ceeded in de­mon­is­ing free trade and the TPP, so much so that... the po­lit­i­cal cost for Joe Bi­den to join CPTPP is too high and it would not get through Congress,” Prof Koh said. “The Amer­i­can lead­er­ship... should wake up. Do you want to be alone in the world, or do you want</p>
    <p>to be... lead­ing the world?”</p>
    <p>SOME TEN­SIONS WILL RE­MAIN</p>
    <p>Although a Bi­den pres­i­dency may ease se­verely strained Sino-US ties, some ar­eas of ten­sion have al­ready be­come a re­al­ity un­likely to be re­versed, such as the US’ free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions in the South China Sea, ac­cord­ing to Prof Chan.</p>
    <p>Those op­er­a­tions in the re­gion – which in­volve the US Navy sail­ing through to re­in­force in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised free­doms de­spite coun­tries’ com­pet­ing claims – are now rou­tine ex­er­cises, she said.</p>
    <p>“When Trump took a strong stance on the South China Sea… re­gional coun­tries also took a stronger stance (against Bei­jing’s claims there),” Prof Chan said, adding that Mr Bi­den’s team is likely to con­tinue its vig­i­lance in the wa­ters.</p>
    <p>The is­sues of Tai­wan and Hong Kong, too, will per­sist, given strong bi­par­ti­san sup­port in the US to en­sure free­doms in both economies are pro­tected.</p>
    <p>DON’T PEDDLE ‘DEMOC­RACY’</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s re­solve to shield Tai­wan from per­ceived threats from Bei­jing would be even stronger un­der a Demo­cratic pres­i­dent given the party’s core be­liefs in uphold­ing democ­racy, Prof Koh said.</p>
    <p>But he warned against Mr Bi­den’s pro­fessed in­ten­tion to host a global democ­racy sum­mit, given dif­fer­ing in­ter­pre­ta­tions of what democ­racy means and how such a fo­rum might risk os­tracis­ing US al­lies like com­mu­nist Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>“You can, with­out us­ing the word ‘democ­racy’, cham­pion good gov­er­nance or rule of law or in­clu­sive growth... in­stead of choos­ing a theme where you ex­clude half your friends,” Prof Koh said.</p>
    <p>Prof Chan had this ad­vice for a Bi­den pres­i­dency look­ing to up­hold democ­racy abroad: “Amer­ica can show that it stands for democ­racy, good gov­er­nance and hu­man rights in other ways. Call out the ac­tions when you see (that they) are wrong, which was some­thing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion did not do in the last four years.”</p>
