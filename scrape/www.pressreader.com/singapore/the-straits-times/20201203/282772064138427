    <p>SEOUL • Trail­blaz­ing South Korean boy band BTS have be­come the first group to have a for­eign-lan­guage song en­ter the United States Bill­board chart at No. 1, as the Par­lia­ment in Seoul cleared the way for them to de­lay com­pul­sory mil­i­tary ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Life Goes On, sung pre­dom­i­nantly in Korean, topped the US Hot 100 in its de­but week, Bill­board said on Mon­day, the first for­eign-lan­guage song to do so in the chart’s 62-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>More good news ar­rived for the seven stars when South Korea’s Par­lia­ment on Tues­day re­vised the mil­i­tary-con­scrip­tion law to give en­ter­tain­ers who have re­ceived a gov­ern­ment medal for rais­ing the na­tional pro­file an ex­tra two years to per­form be­fore en­list­ment.</p>
    <p>All seven BTS mem­bers were awarded the dis­tinc­tion in 2018.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­quires all able­bod­ied men to serve in uni­form to de­fend the coun­try against the nu­clear-armed North, usu­ally for 18 months once they turn 28.</p>
    <p>The South re­mains tech­ni­cally at war with the North and main­tains a com­pul­sory con­scrip­tion sys­tem to de­fend it­self against Py­ongyang’s 1.2 mil­lion-strong army.</p>
    <p>The is­sue had been threat­en­ing to dis­rupt BTS’ progress, with their old­est mem­ber, Jin, 27, pre­vi­ously un­able to de­lay his ser­vice be­yond the end of next year.</p>
    <p>BTS have be­come one of the big­gest acts in the world since they launched seven years ago, and made a bil­lion­aire of their manag­ing agency’s founder.</p>
    <p>Their lat­est sin­gle is also the first mainly Korean song to top the chart.</p>
    <p>BTS’ ear­lier track Dy­na­mite de­buted atop the chart in Septem­ber, but it was sung en­tirely in English, mak­ing it ra­dio-friendly in An­glo­phone coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Dy­na­mite is still on the chart at No. 3 and BTS have another five tracks in the Top 100.</p>
    <p>Life Goes On is the band’s third No. 1 hit in three months, af­ter Dy­na­mite and a remix of Sav­age Love by Jawsh 685 and Ja­son Derulo.</p>
    <p>The band had achieved the feat “more quickly than any act since The Bea­tles”, Bill­board said, af­ter I Want To Hold Your Hand, She Loves You and Can’t Buy Me Love all topped the chart in just over two months in 1964.</p>
