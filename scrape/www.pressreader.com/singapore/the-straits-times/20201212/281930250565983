    <p>BRUSSELS • Euro­pean Union coun­tries struck a deal on the bloc’s new cli­mate tar­get yes­ter­day af­ter hag­gling through the night at a sum­mit in Brussels, pulling the po­lit­i­cal trig­ger on a pol­icy re­vamp to make ev­ery sec­tor greener.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers from the 27-coun­try bloc agreed to cut their net green­house gas emis­sions at least 55 per cent by 2030, from 1990 lev­els, up­grad­ing an ex­ist­ing tar­get to cut by 40 per cent this decade.</p>
    <p>The new tar­get aims to put the EU on track to reach net zero emis­sions by 2050, a dead­line sci­en­tists said the world must meet to avert the most cat­a­strophic im­pacts of cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“Europe is the leader in the fight against cli­mate change. We de­cided to cut our green­house gas emis­sions... at least 55 per cent by 2030,” Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel, who chaired the talks, said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>For Brussels, the deal of­fers a chance to as­sert its cli­mate lead­er­ship on the global stage. The EU will present its tar­get at a United Na­tions vir­tual sum­mit of world lead­ers to­day.</p>
    <p>The tar­get is a hard-won po­lit­i­cal com­pro­mise be­tween wealth­ier, mostly Western and Nordic EU coun­tries that want more am­bi­tious cli­mate ac­tion, and east­ern states with coal-de­pen­dent power sec­tors and en­ergy-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries that wanted spe­cific con­di­tions at­tached to emis­sion cuts.</p>
    <p>Poland held out alone un­til dawn for a deal that, among other things, would guar­an­tee that promised fund­ing from the EU car­bon mar­ket for poorer coun­tries would not be re­duced.</p>
    <p>The EU’s ex­ec­u­tive com­mis­sion is work­ing on de­tailed pol­icy pro­pos­als to de­liver the tar­get. The pro­pos­als will over­haul the EU car­bon mar­ket, speed a shift to elec­tric ve­hi­cles and aim to mo­bilise the huge low-car­bon in­vest­ments needed.</p>
    <p>The “at least 55 per cent” tar­get is as good as fi­nal, but will need ap­proval from the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment, which sup­ports a more am­bi­tious 60 per cent emis­sion cut.</p>
    <p>The new tar­get aims to put the EU on track to reach net zero emis­sions by 2050, a dead­line sci­en­tists said the world must meet to avert the most cat­a­strophic im­pacts of cli­mate change.</p>
