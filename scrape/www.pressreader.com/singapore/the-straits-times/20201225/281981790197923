    <p>Now more than ever, peo­ple need to feel that em­ploy­ers care about them. Lead­ers may be firm and prac­ti­cal but they can al­ways ex­hibit a level of com­pas­sion. How­ever, if this com­pas­sion does not in­clude them­selves, it is in­com­plete. Lead­ers can­not pour from an empty cup. Self-care is im­por­tant so that lead­ers can give the best of them­selves, not the rem­nants of what is left af­ter fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>Work­place men­tal health has taken a front seat this year.</p>
    <p>Al­ready deemed a “highly stressed” na­tion of work­ers, Sin­ga­pore saw the Covid-19 pan­demic bring a per­fect storm of stres­sors to our shores with work-from-home ar­range­ments blur­ring the line be­tween em­ploy­ees’ work and per­sonal lives, so­cial iso­la­tion as peo­ple stayed home while of­fices and shops were shut, fears about job se­cu­rity, and re­stric­tions on travel.</p>
    <p>Prior to the pan­demic, stress-re­lated ill­nesses were al­ready cost­ing Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy $3.2 bil­lion an­nu­ally, ac­cord­ing to a study last year. Whether or­gan­i­sa­tions re­turn to their work­places or con­tinue with their re­mote work­ing ar­range­ments, are em­ploy­ees ready for the new work nor­mal? How can em­ploy­ers keep their work­force men­tally healthy and fu­ture-ready in a post-Covid re­cov­ery?</p>
    <p>Last month, the much-awaited Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Men­tal Well-be­ing at Work­places was re­leased.</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sory out­lines rec­om­men­da­tions to pre­vent work stress from com­pro­mis­ing well-be­ing and pro­duc­tiv­ity at the in­di­vid­ual, team and or­gan­i­sa­tional lev­els.</p>
    <p>As a mem­ber of the re­cent Tri­par­tite Over­sight Com­mit­tee on Work­place Safety and Health, I very much wel­come th­ese rec­om­men­da­tions, which are build­ing blocks for cre­at­ing a men­tal health-friendly work­place.</p>
    <p>Yet, th­ese guide­lines, while use­ful, risk be­com­ing merely the re­spon­si­bil­ity of hu­man re­sources de­part­ments. What is needed is to go be­yond HR func­tions to build men­tal health into the new nor­mal of lead­er­ship, to trans­form the cul­ture of stigma to ac­cep­tance and in­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>LEAD­ERS SET THE TONE</p>
    <p>Lead­ers need to set the tone for in­cul­cat­ing em­ployee well-be­ing through­out the or­gan­i­sa­tion. How lead­ers re­late to men­tal health is­sues, what ex­pec­ta­tions they cre­ate, and whether they are able to view their em­ploy­ees as whole per­sons, in­flu­ence the em­ployee’s ex­pe­ri­ence at work. So in­tro­duc­ing well-be­ing ini­tia­tives, like hav­ing a men­tal health helpline for em­ploy­ees, with­out ad­dress­ing or­gan­i­sa­tional cul­ture or lead­er­ship, is not re­ally help­ful.</p>
    <p>The good news is that men­tal health aware­ness is ris­ing and more lead­ers are com­ing on board the is­sue. Since May 2018, an in­for­mal group of C-suite lead­ers across pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors have com­mit­ted to mak­ing work­place men­tal well-be­ing a lead­er­ship pri­or­ity. Call­ing our­selves the WorkWell Lead­ers Work­group, the com­mu­nity has grown three­fold this year to 75 chief ex­ec­u­tives and lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Over three CEO break­fast di­a­logues, nu­mer­ous quar­terly learn­ing lunches and many one-to-one con­ver­sa­tions, I have ob­served be­liefs and be­hav­iours from the work group mem­bers that demon­strate new pos­si­bil­i­ties in well-be­ing lead­er­ship for em­ploy­ees and work­places to adapt and thrive. They can be sum­marised into a “4C” lead­er­ship model to foster well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>COURAGE</p>
    <p>At the peak of the pan­demic, Dr Daniel Tan, CEO of Park­wayHealth Lab­o­ra­tory and a mem­ber of the WorkWell Work­group, wrote about his own state of burnout in an e-mail to em­ploy­ees. Then he found him­self hes­i­tat­ing a lit­tle be­fore he clicked “send”.</p>
    <p>Change re­quires courage, and vul­ner­a­bil­ity may be the only true mea­sure of strength. Other lead­ers of the work group such as Mr Hsieh Fu Hua (former CEO of the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change) and Mr Piyush Gupta (CEO of DBS Bank) have also shared their per­sonal strug­gles with men­tal health, first within the work group and later with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>When lead­ers share their own ex­pe­ri­ences with men­tal health, they val­i­date that men­tal health is a con­tin­uum and can af­fect ev­ery one, not just some of us. Lead­ers such as Dr Tan, Mr Hsieh and Mr Gupta help open up that space of trust for their team mem­bers to know that hav­ing men­tal health dif­fi­cul­ties does not mean they are less. This helps break the stigma, give hope and en­cour­age help-seek­ing.</p>
    <p>They also be­come bet­ter lead­ers and man­agers in the process as they be­come more aware of who they are (and who they are not), as well as why or how they lead.</p>
    <p>There is a fierce courage in be­ing able to say “I am not per­fect, and that is fine”.</p>
    <p>COM­PAS­SION (CARE)</p>
    <p>In a re­cent study by Qualtrics and SAP, nearly 40 per cent of global em­ploy­ees said that no one at their com­pany had asked them if they were do­ing okay – and those re­spon­dents were 38 per cent more likely than others to say that their men­tal health had de­clined since the out­break.</p>
    <p>Aviva CEO Nishit Ma­j­mu­dar shared at a re­cent di­a­logue ear­lier this month that his com­pany has reg­u­lar “pulse checks” to check with work­ers. “It is through such lis­ten­ing that I know whether the cul­ture that ex­ists in a com­pany is re­flec­tive of the one I want to build: a com­pany with a heart­beat,” he says. An ad­vo­cate of com­pas­sion­ate lead­er­ship, he strongly be­lieves that “em­ploy­ees will go the ex­tra mile and care for the com­pany like their own if the com­pany takes good care of them”.</p>
    <p>Now more than ever, peo­ple need to feel that em­ploy­ers care about them. Lead­ers may be firm and prac­ti­cal but they can al­ways ex­hibit a level of com­pas­sion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if this com­pas­sion does not in­clude them­selves, it is in­com­plete. Lead­ers can­not pour from an empty cup. Self-care is im­por­tant so that lead­ers can give the best of them­selves, not the rem­nants of what is left af­ter fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>CON­GRU­ENCE</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees take cues from their lead­ers and look to them to see how they weather the storms of life. There­fore, lead­ers mustn’t just say they sup­port men­tal well-be­ing, but must also role-model healthy be­hav­iours so that their team mem­bers feel they can pri­ori­tise self-care and set bound­aries.</p>
    <p>Find­ing that he was fall­ing into a pat­tern of work­ing from 8am to mid­night al­most ev­ery day with the work-from-home ar­range­ment, Mr Kevin McGuigan, manag­ing di­rec­tor of the South-east Asia re­gion and Sin­ga­pore coun­try leader at Amer­i­can multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tion 3M, now steps away from his com­puter be­tween 5 pm and 9 pm ev­ery day. He shared this change openly with his team mem­bers and en­cour­aged them “to look for ways to drive a bet­ter work-life bal­ance”.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers like Mr McGuigan give per­mis­sion through their ac­tions and be­hav­iours for staff to build the type of cul­ture they wish to see in their or­gan­i­sa­tion. Stud­ies have found that or­gan­i­sa­tions whose lead­ers are role mod­els for pri­ori­tis­ing health and work-life bal­ance re­ported higher me­dian sat­is­fac­tion rates from em­ploy­ees for their work­force well­ness ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers must walk the talk on well-be­ing be­cause we are what we do, not what we say we will do.</p>
