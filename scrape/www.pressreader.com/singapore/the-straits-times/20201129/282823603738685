    <p>What, Chris­tian Erik­sen won­dered, was Frank Lam­pard re­ally like? “Pro­fes­sional as a player,” Jose Mour­inho replied. “The best I’ve ever seen.” The ex­change, cap­tured in the All Or Noth­ing doc­u­men­tary, was a re­minder of how fun­da­men­tal Mour­inho and Lam­pard were to each other’s suc­cess.</p>
    <p>After tak­ing the Chelsea job, Mour­inho ac­costed a naked Lam­pard in the shower to tell him he was the world’s best player. As Lam­pard ac­cepted, he was not, but un­der Mour­inho, he went on to fin­ish sec­ond in the Bal­lon d’Or vot­ing and score 60 goals in three sea­sons from mid­field.</p>
    <p>So when Lam­pard, like his men­tor, be­came Chelsea man­ager, it was tempt­ing to as­sume he would prove a Mour­inho dis­ci­ple.</p>
    <p>It only took one game to dash those as­sump­tions. Mour­inho was a pun­dit when Lam­pard’s reign be­gan with a 4-0 loss to Manch­ester United. In a mis­judged at­tack, Mour­inho picked on Tammy Abra­ham and Ma­son Mount, who were given first Premier League starts for Chelsea by Lam­pard.</p>
    <p>It high­lighted a dif­fer­ence be­tween them. Lam­pard’s faith in youth has be­come a flag­ship pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The only prod­uct of Chelsea’s academy to be a reg­u­lar un­der Mour­inho was John Terry, al­ready an es­tab­lished fig­ure then. He has the con­ser­vatism of a man­ager who prefers se­nior play­ers.</p>
    <p>Lam­pard’s bold­ness in trust­ing the new will be sym­bol­ised today, when youth­ful suc­cess sto­ries</p>
    <p>Abra­ham, Mount and Reece James are all likely to start against Mour­inho’s Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>Nor is it the only sig­nif­i­cant split in think­ing. Lam­pard is more nat­u­rally at­tack­ing and up­beat. He prefers a higher press­ing game, whereas Mour­inho favours a low block. In that re­spect, Lam­pard has more in com­mon with Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino. Chelsea play more of a pos­ses­sion game than Mour­inho’s Spurs; or in­deed, than his more re­cent Chelsea teams.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho has had a greater em­pha­sis on counter-at­tack­ing, but it has of­ten been un­der­pinned by the neg­a­tive thought that the team in pos­ses­sion is like­lier to make a mis­take. His finest Chelsea side, the class of 2004-05, were vir­tu­ally flaw­less in con­ced­ing only 15 goals. Lam­pard’s team were their po­lar op­po­sites last year, let­ting in 54. Their re­cent de­fen­sive im­prove­ment bodes well, but only one of them has a rep­u­ta­tion as a supreme de­fen­sive strate­gist. It isn’t Lam­pard.</p>
    <p>The irony is that Chelsea’s sole away clean sheet last sea­son came at Tot­ten­ham. Lam­pard out­wit­ted Mour­inho. In­clud­ing a Stam­ford Bridge tri­umph, he did twice. Both times, Chelsea used a back three whereas Mour­inho was long a devo­tee of a back four. Lam­pard now prefers a 4-3-3 but is more flex­i­ble than the Por­tuguese and has tried more sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, mean­while, has a tac­tic Lam­pard of­ten es­chews: mind games. The English­man rarely tries to un­der­mine or ir­ri­tate fel­low man­agers in press con­fer­ences. He is his own man, not a car­bon copy. Maybe, as he also played for man­agers from Clau­dio Ranieri to Carlo Ancelotti, Roberto di Mat­teo to Fabio Capello, it is no sur­prise. Maybe it is ex­plained be­cause one was a ca­reer coach and the other a great player but, as man­agers, more sep­a­rates Mour­inho and Lam­pard than unites them.</p>
    <p>Frank Lam­pard’s bold­ness in trust­ing the new will be sym­bol­ised today, when youth­ful suc­cess sto­ries Tammy Abra­ham, Ma­son Mount and Reece James are all likely to start against Jose Mour­inho’s Tot­ten­ham.</p>
