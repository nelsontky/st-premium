    <p>HANOI • Viet­nam hunted for sur­vivors yes­ter­day af­ter land­slides trig­gered by Ty­phoon Molave, one of its strong­est storms in decades, lashed a cen­tral re­gion al­ready reel­ing from weeks of heavy rain that led to at least 160 deaths.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of sol­diers with heavy equip­ment were de­ployed to land­slides in re­mote ar­eas of Quang Nam prov­ince, where 19 peo­ple were killed and 12 were miss­ing.</p>
    <p>At the site of one land­slide that buried a vil­lage of 53 peo­ple, res­cue work­ers pulled 33 sur­vivors from the mud, Tuoi Tre news­pa­per re­ported.</p>
    <p>“The whole vil­lage was flat­tened,” Ms Ho Thi Ha, who lost her fa­ther in the land­slide, told Tuoi Tre. “There’s noth­ing left.”</p>
    <p>As well as the dead, scores more were still miss­ing, mostly in land­slides, as a re­sult of a suc­ces­sion of storms which has ham­mered Viet­nam since early this month.</p>
    <p>The bod­ies of 12 fish­er­men were found at sea yes­ter­day and the navy was search­ing for 14 oth­ers who went miss­ing af­ter their boats sank while try­ing to come ashore two days ear­lier, state broad­caster VTV re­ported.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Trinh Dinh Dung said in a state­ment: “We can fore­cast the storm path or the amount of rain, but can’t pre­dict when land­slides hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Complicati­ng res­cue ef­forts was the emer­gence of un­ex­ploded bombs un­cov­ered by heavy rain. At least seven Amer­i­can MK82 bombs from the United States-Viet­nam war were dis­cov­ered in the cen­tral prov­ince of Quang Tri yes­ter­day, state me­dia said.</p>
    <p>Over a mil­lion peo­ple have been af­fected for weeks by the storms, which have caused heavy rain and some of the worst flood­ing in years in cen­tral Viet­nam, push­ing re­lief agen­cies to their lim­its.</p>
    <p>Molave hit the Philip­pines at the week­end and deaths in the coun­try from mud­slides and floods rose to 16 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ty­phoon dam­aged 56,000 homes in Viet­nam and left mil­lions with­out elec­tric­ity, with heavy rain ex­pected in the cen­tral re­gion un­til to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The ty­phoon weak­ened to a trop­i­cal de­pres­sion af­ter mak­ing land­fall on Wed­nes­day and by yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, the skies over the worst-af­fected ar­eas had cleared, VTV said, help­ing res­cue ef­forts.</p>
    <p>‘‘ The whole vil­lage was flat­tened. There’s noth­ing left. MS HO THI HA, who lost her fa­ther in a land­slide that buried a vil­lage of 53 peo­ple. ’’</p>
