    <p>• Rory McIl­roy said play­ing with­out ex­pec­ta­tions, fol­low­ing the birth of his first child, had helped him re­dis­cover some of his best form as he shot a six-un­der 64 in the open­ing round of the sea­son-end­ing Tour Cham­pi­onship in At­lanta on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The North­ern Ir­ish­man, who be­gan the day in 12th at three un­der based on the FedEx­Cup stag­gered scor­ing sys­tem, got his ti­tle de­fence off to a fly­ing start just five days af­ter his daugh­ter Poppy was born and said he was sur­prised by how quickly he found his groove.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, a lit­tle bit. You know, it just shows you golf is such a men­tal game and, if you come in with low ex­pec­ta­tions, that’s al­ways how I’ve played well,” said the 31-year-old, who did not touch a club for four days.</p>
    <p>“Whether I don’t feel like my game is in a good place or I’m not the favourite com­ing into a tour­na­ment... I feel that’s when I usu­ally play my best and I can play with a bit of free­dom, and that’s what I did today.”</p>
    <p>He is fourth on nine un­der, four be­hind co-lead­ers Dustin John­son (67) and Jon Rahm (65). As top seed in the sea­son-long points stand­ings, top-ranked John­son started the day at 10 un­der and ended at 13 un­der along­side world No. 2 Rahm. Justin Thomas, the 2017 play-off cham­pion, shot a 66 to be third on 11 un­der.</p>
    <p>McIl­roy, with­out a top-10 fin­ish since the PGA Tour re­turned from a three-month coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut­down in June, had pre­vi­ously ac­knowl­edged he was dis­tracted over the last few weeks.</p>
    <p>He said he con­stantly kept think­ing of his daugh­ter dur­ing the first round. “It’s like ev­ery three hours she’s sup­posed to be fed, so I’m like, okay, there’s a feed­ing com­ing up,” he added, af­ter fin­ish­ing with three con­sec­u­tive birdies at East Lake.</p>
    <p>“But it’s nat­u­ral... that in be­tween shots you think about other things, and ob­vi­ously my mind has been very much on what’s go­ing on at home. But it’s nice to have this lit­tle four or five hours to my­self, con­cen­trate on my game and get into this stuff.”</p>
    <p>The win­ner from t he elite 30-player field will be crowned FedEx­Cup cham­pion and take home US$15 mil­lion (S$20.4 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>AL­WAYS ON MY MIND</p>
    <p>It’s like ev­ery three hours she’s sup­posed to be fed, so I’m like, okay, there’s a feed­ing com­ing up. But it’s nat­u­ral... that in be­tween shots you think about other things, and ob­vi­ously my mind has been very much on what’s go­ing on at home.</p>
    <p>RORY MCIL­ROY , the de­fend­ing cham­pion, on think­ing about his new­born daugh­ter Poppy while on the course.</p>
