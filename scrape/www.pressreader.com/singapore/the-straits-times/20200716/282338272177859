    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Nikola Jokic, re­turn­ing from a pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus test, com­pleted his quar­an­tine on Tues­day and watched his Den­ver Nuggets team­mates prac­tise at the Walt Dis­ney World Re­sort near Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 while in his na­tive Ser­bia last month.</p>
    <p>He trav­elled to cen­tral Florida separately from his team­mates, ar­riv­ing last Satur­day, then was quar­an­tined while wait­ing to pass two coro­n­avirus tests in a 48-hour pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (NBA) health and safety pro­to­cols, any per­son who tests pos­i­tive has to un­dergo a car­diac screen­ing and then re­ceive two con­sec­u­tive neg­a­tive tests be­fore they can re­turn to their teams.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters dur­ing a video con­fer­ence call on Tues­day, Jokic said the pos­i­tive test sur­prised him be­cause he was asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>“It was kind of weird. I was feel­ing good and feel­ing nor­mal,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Nuggets closed their prac­tice fa­cil­ity two weeks ago when “mul­ti­ple peo­ple” in the team’s trav­el­ling party tested pos­i­tive for the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Even now, coach Mike Malone said he is not sure when he will have his full team avail­able ahead of the league’s re­sump­tion in the Florida “bub­ble” on July 30.</p>
    <p>He added of Jokic: “Nikola is a big part of what we’re try­ing to do. Hav­ing him here fi­nally is great. He and I have a tremen­dous re­la­tion­ship. It was won­der­ful to see him walk through those doors.”</p>
    <p>Jokic also ad­dressed the hot topic of his physique.</p>
    <p>A widely cir­cu­lated photo of him dur­ing the NBA’s hia­tus showed him look­ing far leaner than his listed weight of 128.8kg.</p>
    <p>He said he had lost 9-11kg dur­ing the sea­son be­fore play halted, then lost an ad­di­tional 1.4-2.3kg.</p>
    <p>“About the pic­tures, I see how peo­ple don’t see the (long-term) changes,” he said. “I didn’t lose that much pounds in the quar­an­tine and corona.</p>
    <p>“I’m just happy to be here and fi­nally come to Or­lando to be with the team. Maybe I’ll sur­prise every­body. You will see.”</p>
    <p>Malone has main­tained all along that the club’s All-Star cen­tre has stayed healthy de­spite the pos­i­tive test.</p>
    <p>“So much is be­ing made of Nikola’s weight loss. I think there was a pic­ture that spread like wild­fire while he was home in Ser­bia,” he said. “The funny thing for me is long be­fore the league was sus­pended on March 11, Nikola had lost a ton of weight from the be­gin­ning of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“To his credit, he just con­tin­ued to be dis­ci­plined and fo­cused with his rou­tine dur­ing the sus­pen­sion and hia­tus.”</p>
    <p>Jokic, 25, is av­er­ag­ing 20.2 points, 10.2 re­bounds and 6.9 as­sists per game this sea­son. In five NBA sea­sons, all with Den­ver, he is av­er­ag­ing 16.9 points, 9.7 re­bounds and 5.4 as­sists.</p>
    <p>The Nuggets (43-22) sat in third place in the Western Con­fer­ence when the NBA sus­pended the sea­son on March 11 due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They are sched­uled to re­turn to ac­tion on Aug 1 against the Mi­ami Heat.</p>
