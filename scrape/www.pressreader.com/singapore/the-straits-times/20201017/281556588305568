    <p>A man and a woman linked to a se­ries of thefts of Bud­get 2020 Gro­cery Vouch­ers from Hous­ing Board let­ter­boxes across Sin­ga­pore were charged in court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Miqheul Wahyudean Ab­dul­lah, 24, was charged with three counts of theft, while Ir­wani Nur Amira Azami, 23, was charged with two counts of theft.</p>
    <p>They were ar­rested on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>They had al­legedly worked to­gether some time between 8pm on Oct 6 and 3.30am on Oct 7 to prise open two let­ter­boxes at Block 872, Tampines Street 86, and steal 15 gro­cery vouch­ers val­ued at $10 each.</p>
    <p>Miqheul, who had al­legedly stolen vouch­ers at the same lo­ca­tion on a sep­a­rate oc­ca­sion, was charged with an ad­di­tional count of theft.</p>
    <p>The pair are ex­pected to be back in court on Nov 6, as in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of theft, the of­fender may be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both.</p>
    <p>Separately, the po­lice also ar­rested five oth­ers – three men and two women – for their sus­pected in­volve­ment in the theft of gro­cery vouch­ers at other lo­ca­tions across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Among them was a 37-year-old woman who was caught on Sun­day for al­legedly steal­ing the vouch­ers at a res­i­den­tial block in Lorong 7 Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, a 41-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman were ar­rested at a res­i­den­tial block in Mar­sil­ing Road for the al­leged voucher thefts.</p>
    <p>Two 54-year-old men were nabbed in sep­a­rate cases on Thurs­day for al­legedly steal­ing vouch­ers at hous­ing blocks in Telok Blan­gah</p>
    <p>Rise and in Holland Close.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Thurs­day, the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force said th­ese theft cases are “likely un­re­lated and op­por­tunis­tic in na­ture”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have also re­ceived re­ports of sim­i­lar in­ci­dents in other res­i­den­tial es­tates and said they are “in­ten­si­fy­ing our ef­forts with a view to ap­pre­hend the per­pe­tra­tors and bring them to jus­tice”.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic who are el­i­gi­ble for the Bud­get 2020 Gro­cery</p>
    <p>Vouch­ers are ad­vised to col­lect them from their let­ter­box as soon as pos­si­ble, and keep their let­ter­box se­cured at all times.</p>
    <p>Those who sus­pect their vouch­ers have been stolen should make a po­lice re­port im­me­di­ately and call the Gro­cery Voucher hot­line on 1800-2222-888 to re­quest that their vouch­ers be voided and re­placed.</p>
