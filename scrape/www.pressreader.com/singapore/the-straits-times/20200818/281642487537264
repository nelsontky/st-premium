    <p>A new $1 bil­lion scheme will be in­tro­duced to boost the hir­ing of lo­cal work­ers in the com­ing months, in­clud­ing in growth sec­tors, with a spe­cial fo­cus on help­ing older work­ers.</p>
    <p>Firms that raise their head­count of lo­cal work­ers over the next six months will re­ceive a sub­sidy for up to 25 per cent of salaries of new lo­cal hires for one year, sub­ject to a cap, un­der the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day. This ap­plies to growth firms that meet the qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The co-payment by the Govern­ment will be up to 50 per cent for work­ers aged 40 and above, he said in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on fur­ther mea­sures to sup­port firms and work­ers amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers praised the fo­cus on older work­ers, who of­ten face greater chal­lenges re­main­ing em­ploy­able or find­ing a new job if they have not been able to up­date their skills in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­tijn Schouten, PwC’s South-east Asia peo­ple and or­gan­i­sa­tion con­sult­ing leader, said: “While the (growth) sec­tors may al­ready be hir­ing, the sub­sidy will en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to take on lo­cal work­ers, in par­tic­u­lar, sup­port­ing ma­ture work­ers who are at higher risk of dis­place­ment due to digital dis­rup­tion.”</p>
    <p>OCBC chief econ­o­mist Se­lena Ling said the move may help level the play­ing field to some ex­tent as older work­ers may have higher salaries and be dis­crim­i­nated against at this time, when there is sig­nif­i­cant slack in the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>EY Asean work­force ad­vi­sory leader Samir Bedi noted that there may be a re­quire­ment to pro­vide reskilling, but this cost is also be­ing cov­ered through fund­ing, which makes it com­mer­cially vi­able for com­pa­nies to con­sider ma­ture work­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap said the in­cen­tive could en­cour­age com­pa­nies to con­tinue hir­ing or do so more ag­gres­sively, though they would also con­sider mar­ket forces and the avail­able tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “There are bright spots amidst the se­vere eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion. Our bio­med­i­cal sciences, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and ICT (in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy) sec­tors con­tinue to need more work­ers,” he said. “The pub­lic health­care and long-term care sec­tors are hir­ing. Some firms in the food and bev­er­age, and man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors are grow­ing and in­no­vat­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power will give more details on the scheme later this month.</p>
