    <p>TOKYO • Sam­ples of an as­ter­oid 480 mil­lion km from Earth ar­rived in Ja­pan yes­ter­day to ap­plause and smiles, the cli­max of a six-year odyssey by a space probe pur­su­ing the ori­gins of life.</p>
    <p>Named for the pere­grine fal­con, the Hayabusa2 blasted off for the as­ter­oid Ryugu in De­cem­ber 2014, over­com­ing an un­ex­pect­edly rough land­ing sur­face to col­lect sam­ples of as­ter­oid dust in a cap­sule.</p>
    <p>That cap­sule plunged to Earth in Aus­tralia on Sun­day, and was flown to Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal stage of its jour­ney was by truck to the Ja­pan Aerospace Ex­plo­ration Agency (Jaxa) re­search cen­tre out­side Tokyo, where it was greeted by a crowd of ex­cited re­searchers.</p>
    <p>“The cap­sule has re­turned, I was out at the gate to see it,” project man­ager Yuichi Tsuda told a news con­fer­ence. “The re­al­i­sa­tion that it had gone all the way to the as­ter­oid and back came welling up, and I felt as if some­thing had squeezed my heart.”</p>
    <p>As­teroids are be­lieved to have been formed at the dawn of the so­lar sys­tem, and sci­en­tists said the sam­ple might con­tain or­ganic mat­ter that could have con­trib­uted to life on Earth.</p>
    <p>The Hayabusa2 or­bited above Ryugu for a few months be­fore land­ing, then used small ex­plo­sives to blast a crater and col­lected the re­sult­ing de­bris, with the ex­pec­ta­tion that some 100mg could have been gath­ered.</p>
    <p>After drop­ping off the cap­sule, it changed course, head­ing back into space.</p>
    <p>Travel and land­ing re­stric­tions posed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic were an­other hur­dle with re­searchers at one point con­sid­er­ing whether to post­pone the cap­sule’s re­turn.</p>
    <p>Next up is open­ing the cap­sule. By as early as next week, it may be known if suf­fi­cient ma­te­rial has been col­lected, said re­searcher To­mo­hiro Usui, not­ing the work will be ex­tremely del­i­cate.</p>
    <p>“We need to be care­ful not to break the cap­sule or knock it over,” he said. “Once that’s done, the stress will ease up a bit.”</p>
    <p>OVER THE MOON</p>
    <p>I felt as if some­thing had squeezed my heart. ’’</p>
