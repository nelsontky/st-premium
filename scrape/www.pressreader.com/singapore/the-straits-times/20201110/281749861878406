    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia’s econ­omy, left cratered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, is draw­ing en­ergy from one of its in­vis­i­ble and of­ten ne­glected en­gines: farm­ers.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness lead­ers, pol­i­cy­mak­ers and politi­cians alike are pin­ning hopes on the ru­ral sec­tor as boun­ti­ful rains have set the stage for an­other year of record crops. Higher dis­pos­able in­comes with farm­ers are ex­pected to boost de­mand for prod­ucts rang­ing from cars to ce­ment to gold jew­ellery.</p>
    <p>That con­trasts with the ur­ban ar­eas, where com­pa­nies are still strug­gling to boost their sales amid the pan­demic which has hit busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties, hurt de­mand and caused labour short­age. The ad­verse im­pact of the world’s strictest lock­down in March con­tin­ues to haunt, but the hinterland is hold­ing out hope.</p>
    <p>Maruti Suzuki In­dia and the lo­cal unit of South Korea’s Hyundai Mo­tor, the two main play­ers in In­dia’s car mar­ket, said Oc­to­ber sales were the best ever for any month. Hero Mo­toCorp, the world’s largest maker of mo­tor­cy­cles and scoot­ers, as well as smaller ri­val Ba­jaj Auto, re­ported record sales, as ru­ral mar­kets pro­vided a cush­ion against a down­turn in cities.</p>
    <p>“We have seen a stronger de­mand from ru­ral ar­eas across cat­e­gories for our prod­ucts as com­pared with last year,” Mr Srini­vasu Al­laphan, direc­tor of sales and mar­ket­ing at JK Tyre & In­dus­tries, said in an e-mail re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect it to sus­tain for the next three quar­ters. Higher sales in ru­ral mar­kets will com­pen­sate for the losses in ur­ban and semi­ur­ban towns.”</p>
    <p>Ru­ral in­comes have stayed strong as pro­duc­tion of mon­soon­sown food grains is es­ti­mated to hit record 144.5 mil­lion tonnes. The gov­ern­ment’s move to raise sup­port prices for some crops and boost spend­ing on ru­ral employment pro­grammes have also sup­ported in­comes of farm­ers and labour­ers.</p>
    <p>“De­spite Covid-19 and the re­lated lock­down, the agri­cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties across the coun­try have al­most re­mained un­af­fected. This has raised the hope that ru­ral de­mand could drive the eco­nomic re</p>

    <p>cov­ery,” ac­cord­ing to In­dia Rat­ings and Re­search, a unit of Fitch Rat­ings.</p>
    <p>Even constructi­on ac­tiv­i­ties gath­ered pace.</p>
    <p>JSW Steel’s re­tail sales vol­ume more than dou­bled from a quar­ter ear­lier in the July-Septem­ber pe­riod, the com­pany said, while Mr Ajoy Chawla, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the jew­ellery divi­sion of Ti­tan Co, said de­mand in tier 2 and 3 mar­kets was fu­elled by wed­dings that were post­poned ear­lier.</p>
    <p>But top com­pany of­fi­cials and an­a­lysts re­main cau­tious.</p>
    <p>While de­mand is “good”, and is likely to re­main so for the rest of the year be­cause of a good mon­soon, it’s dif­fi­cult to pre­dict sales be­yond that, Mr R.C. Bhar­gava, chair­man of car­maker Maruti, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>A rush to own pri­vate ve­hi­cles as peo­ple move away from mass trans­port will be over by Jan­uary, he said.</p>
    <p>“I would not re­ally bet on the mass con­sumer com­ing back in a hurry be­cause so far I am not see­ing any ev­i­dence of it,” Mr Ra­jiv Ba­jaj, man­ag­ing direc­tor at Ba­jaj Auto, told CNBC TV-18.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­tremely con­cerned, I’m very anx­ious.”</p>
    <p>De­spite Covid-19... the agri­cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties across the coun­try have al­most re­mained un­af­fected.</p>
