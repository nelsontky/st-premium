    <p>Res­i­dents of Block 202 in Cle­menti Av­enue 6 will now be no­ti­fied on their mo­bile phones of new mail and can col­lect it with a touch of their phone screens dur­ing a year-long trial.</p>
    <p>PostPal was launched yes­ter­day by Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Sim Ann. In the past week, nine in 10 el­i­gi­ble house­holds in the Hous­ing Board block have reg­is­tered for the trial.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of Block 202 Cle­menti Av­enue 6 will now be no­ti­fied on their mo­bile phones of new mail and can col­lect it with a touch of their phone screens dur­ing a year­long trial.</p>
    <p>All they have to do is launch the SingPost app on their phones to gen­er­ate a QR code.</p>
    <p>They can then scan the code at a smart let­ter box kiosk, called PostPal, at the foot of their block and the mail will be dis­pensed by the ma­chine.</p>
    <p>PostPal was launched yes­ter­day by Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Sim Ann.</p>
    <p>In the past week, nine in 10 el­i­gi­ble house­holds in the Hous­ing Board block have reg­is­tered for the trial.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents will be no­ti­fied of mail de­liv­ery via the SingPost app, which also en­ables them to check the num­ber of items pend­ing col­lec­tion and au­tho­rise oth­ers to col­lect mail on their be­half.</p>
    <p>The smart let­ter box sys­tem can auto-sort mail as well, which means post­men sim­ply need to load all the mail into the ma­chine with­out sort­ing them out in­di­vid­u­ally.</p>
    <p>This re­duces the time taken to de­liver mail from 20 min­utes to just five, said a SingPost spokesman.</p>
    <p>Speaking to re­porters, Ms Sim said: “Our res­i­dents have shown great will­ing­ness and readi­ness to try new things. I think this re­flects that we have come to a cer­tain stage in dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>When asked whether the Govern­ment has plans to fur­ther im­prove the postal ser­vice, she said the sky was the limit for a smart let­ter box sys­tem that can save on man­power.</p>
    <p>The PostPal trial will be pro­gres­sively rolled out to more precincts, in­clud­ing one in the north, sub­ject to the per­for­mance in Cle­menti as well as ap­proval from the au­thor­i­ties, SingPost had said ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents of Block 205 Cle­menti Av­enue 6 will join the pi­lot in the weeks ahead.</p>
    <p>PostPal was de­vel­oped in col­lab­o­ra­tion with PBA Group, a ro­bot­ics and au­to­ma­tion firm head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The smart let­ter box sys­tem is pow­ered by the Mi­crosoft Azure In­ter­net of Things plat­form.</p>
    <p>SingPost’s Sin­ga­pore head and chief ex­ec­u­tive of postal ser­vices Vincent Phang said he was heart­ened by the rate of adop­tion.</p>
    <p>“We (will) con­tinue our out­reach ef­forts to make sure that we get the rest of the res­i­dents on board as well,” he added.</p>
    <p>Since Dec 11, SingPost staff have been sta­tioned at the void deck of Block 202 to in­tro­duce res­i­dents to the smart let­ter box sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dent Sa­rina Tan, 62, said: “It was very easy to learn and use.</p>
    <p>“What I like about this is that I don’t have to open the let­ter box un­nec­es­sar­ily every day.”</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents can call 6845-6222 or e-mail postpal@singpost.com if they have PostPal-re­lated queries and feed­back.</p>
