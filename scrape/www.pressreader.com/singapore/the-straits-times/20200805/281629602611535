    <p>Pedes­tri­ans are urged to stay away, if pos­si­ble, from paths they have to share with cy­clists. But if they must use these shared paths, they are ad­vised to keep left un­less they are over­tak­ing an­other pedes­trian.</p>
    <p>An­other good prac­tice the au­thor­i­ties want pedes­tri­ans to adopt is to re­frain from us­ing their mo­bile phones while walk­ing on shared paths.</p>
    <p>These are some of the sug­gested habits set out by the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) in Sin­ga­pore’s first code of con­duct for pedes­tri­ans. It came into ef­fect this month, on Aug 1.</p>
    <p>The new code is an ad­di­tion to the ex­ist­ing code of con­duct for other users of public paths, such as cy­clists and e-ecooter rid­ers.</p>
    <p>It is also part of mea­sures pro­posed late last year by the Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel (AMAP).</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, LTA said it will roll out a cam­paign to en­cour­age gra­cious behaviour on shared paths and foot­paths by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore trans­port in­fra­struc­ture ex­pert Ray­mond Ong wel­comed the new code, say­ing a pedes­trian who is not dis­tracted will be bet­ter able to avoid ac­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>“Pedes­tri­ans need to un­der­stand that they have a role to play in en­sur­ing their own safety,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Also, in Sin­ga­pore, we don’t have a lot of phys­i­cal space to cre­ate sep­a­ra­tions be­tween paths, so</p>
    <p>Pedes­tri­ans need to un­der­stand that they have a role to play in en­sur­ing their own safety. Also, in Sin­ga­pore, we don’t have a lot of phys­i­cal space to cre­ate sep­a­ra­tions be­tween paths, so it is more about shaping behaviour and try­ing to make the en­vi­ron­ment more con­ducive for walk­ing and cy­cling. it is more about shaping behaviour and try­ing to make the en­vi­ron­ment more con­ducive for walk­ing and cy­cling.”</p>
    <p>He did not think penal­ties are the an­swer to de­vel­op­ing good behaviour. “What is im­por­tant is to ed­u­cate the public such that the behaviour be­comes in­tu­itive,” he said.</p>
    <p>Other LTA-rec­om­mended behaviour for pedes­tri­ans in­cludes us­ing pedes­trian cross­ings on roads in­stead of bi­cy­cle cross­ings as well as re­frain­ing from lis­ten­ing to mu­sic in a way that will pre­vent them from de­tect­ing dan­ger or on­com­ing ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>But Mr Fran­cis Chu, co-founder of cy­cling group Love Cy­cling SG who pre­vi­ously sat on the AMAP, said the pedes­trian code of con­duct was un­nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>“For­mal­is­ing keep­ing to the left while walk­ing can cause some ag­gres­sive rid­ers to shift the blame to the vic­tim in the case of an ac­ci­dent,” he said.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther pointed out that some pedes­tri­ans, such as the el­derly and young chil­dren, may not be able to keep left and be alert at all times.</p>
    <p>“If the main ob­jec­tive is safety for all path users, aren’t the two sim­ple rules of rid­ers giv­ing way and keep­ing a safe dis­tance from pedes­tri­ans suf­fi­cient?” he added.</p>
    <p>This behaviour has been un­der­lined in an ear­lier code of con­duct for path users that fo­cused on how per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vice (PMD) users and cy­clists can ride safely.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the pedes­trian code of con­duct, two other rules for ac­tive mo­bil­ity safety also took ef­fect this month.</p>
    <p>One is the ban on those aged be­low 16 from rid­ing elec­tric scoot­ers with­out su­per­vi­sion, and the other is making it an of­fence for cy­clists and PMD users to use their mo­bile phones while rid­ing.</p>
    <p>For adults su­per­vis­ing un­der­age e-scooter rid­ers, LTA wants them to keep their eyes on one rider at a time and not to let them out of their sight.</p>
    <p>They need to also ed­u­cate the young rider about safe rid­ing and the rel­e­vant reg­u­la­tions, like not ex­ceed­ing 25kmh on a cy­cling path.</p>
