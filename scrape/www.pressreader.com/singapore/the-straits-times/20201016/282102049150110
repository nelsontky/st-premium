    <p>We thank Dr Hussin Mu­talib for his feed­back (Cruises pose greater risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion, Oct 12).</p>
    <p>We agree that the safety and well-be­ing of the lo­cal com­mu­nity, as well as pas­sen­gers and crew, should be our top pri­or­ity. That is why the pi­lot cruise sail­ings will re­quire all pas­sen­gers to be tested for Covid-19 prior to board­ing the cruise.</p>
    <p>Cruise ships will also sail at a re­duced ca­pac­ity of up to 50 per cent. To fur­ther re­duce the risk of trans­mis­sion, these sail­ings will be round trips with no ports of call and open only to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The ship’s crew will also be tested three times and iso­lated for 14 days in their home coun­try and another 14 days in Sin­ga­pore prior to start­ing work, a pro­to­col which goes be­yond Sin­ga­pore’s pre­vail­ing re­quire­ments for cross-bor­der travel.</p>
    <p>Prior to sail­ing, cruise lines must ob­tain Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s (STB) CruiseSafe cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme, which sets out strin­gent hy­giene and safety mea­sures through­out the pas­sen­ger jour­ney.</p>
    <p>In de­vel­op­ing the pro­gramme, we con­sulted widely with med­i­cal and in­dus­try ex­perts, and bench­marked it against global stan­dards, from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion to World Tourism Or­gan­i­sa­tion to Cruise Lines In­ter­na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion, as well as Sin­ga­pore’s safe man­age­ment mea­sures and SG Clean.</p>
    <p>Some of these mea­sures in­clude no re­cir­cu­la­tion of air, strict and fre­quent clean­ing and sani­ti­sa­tion pro­to­cols, and in­sti­tut­ing rapid and clear emer­gency re­sponse plans for any sus­pected Covid-19 in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>On board the ship, all land-based safe man­age­ment mea­sures (such as those ap­pli­ca­ble in a res­tau­rant or a re­cre­ational fa­cil­ity) will also be ap­plied. To en­sure com­pli­ance, in­de­pen­dent third-party in­spec­tors will con­duct reg­u­lar on-board in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>With these mea­sures in place, the Gov­ern­ment has as­sessed that the pi­lot cruises are as safe as most ac­tiv­i­ties and set­tings that have since re­sumed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>We will con­tinue to mon­i­tor global stan­dards and pro­to­cols and up­date the mea­sures ac­cord­ingly. The out­comes of the pi­lot sail­ings will also be mon­i­tored care­fully in the com­ing months be­fore fur­ther de­ci­sions are made.</p>
