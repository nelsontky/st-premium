    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Ten­sions are ris­ing i n the l argest party i n Malaysia’s rul­ing coali­tion over whether a gen­eral elec­tion should be held amid the na­tion’s wors­en­ing coron­avirus epi­demic.</p>
    <p>Ties between Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia and key ally Umno, which holds about a third of the seats in Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s 12-party Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment, have steadily de­te­ri­o­rated since Umno threat­ened to pull out of the coali­tion in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Now at least two min­is­ters have pushed back against calls from Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi to hold a gen­eral elec­tion as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter Khairy Ja­malud­din said hold­ing a vote dur­ing an out­break was ir­re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“I know among those ask­ing for an im­me­di­ate elec­tion are peo­ple from my own party,” Mr Khairy wrote on Twit­ter on Wed­nes­day, re­fer­ring to Umno.</p>
    <p>“Don’t be self­ish.”</p>
    <p>The in­tra-party ri­valry came to a head this week when Zahid stripped a pro-gov­ern­ment Cab­i­net min­is­ter of his party po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The Umno min­is­ter in ques­tion, Tan Sri An­nuar Musa, said on Wed­nes­day he was against any at­tempts to bring down the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t com­fort­able with the re­peated talks of dis­solv­ing Par­lia­ment,” said Mr An­nuar in a tele­vised press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We shouldn’t be talk­ing about an elec­tion when the peo­ple are so wor­ried about Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>A gen­eral elec­tion should be held only af­ter the coron­avirus sit­u­a­tion im­proves and is un­der con­trol, Mr Muhyid­din’s Ber­satu party said in a state­ment late on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu’s main agenda for now is to fo­cus all ef­forts to­wards man­ag­ing the pan­demic and re­viv­ing the econ­omy, it said.</p>
    <p>Snap polls could sig­nif­i­cantly worsen Malaysia’s virus woes.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is strug­gling to con­tain a new wave that was fu­elled by a Septem­ber state elec­tion in Sabah, one of its few Covid-19 hot spots.</p>
    <p>It re­ported a record 3,027 new coron­avirus cases yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to the health min­istry, and is mulling over tar­geted lockdowns to stem the spread.</p>
    <p>Malaysia went through po­lit­i­cal up­heaval last year as var­i­ous fac­tions jock­eyed for power af­ter for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad abruptly stepped down in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din emerged as the head of an un­wieldy bloc with a ma­jor­ity of only a few law­mak­ers, prompt­ing re­peated con­cerns about the strength and dura­bil­ity of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter sur­vived his lat­est l ead­er­ship test last month when his bud­get won the ap­proval of law­mak­ers in Par­lia­ment. A spokesman for the Prime Min­is­ter did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>At a meet­ing among Umno’s top lead­ers on Wed­nes­day night, the party agreed that it would de­cide on Jan 31 whether to push the gov­ern­ment to hold a gen­eral elec­tion be­fore the end of the first quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>The party would also make a de­ci­sion on cut­ting ties with Ber­satu for the next polls, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment by the party.</p>
    <p>Snap polls could sig­nif­i­cantly worsen Malaysia’s virus woes.</p>
