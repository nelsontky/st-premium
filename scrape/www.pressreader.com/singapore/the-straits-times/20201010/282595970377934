    <p>Ms Ni­chol Ng was born into a food fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Her late grand­fa­ther founded Ng Chye Mong, a food trad­ing business, in 1939. Her late father was a foodie and in­tro­duced her to clay­pot civet cat as well as fine cognac.</p>
    <p>She picked up cook­ing even be­fore she started school­ing, learning the recipes of her grandaunt and late grand­mother.</p>
    <p>In 2007, at just 29, the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore eco­nom­ics grad­u­ate co-founded a restau­rant sup­plies com­pany with her brother.</p>
    <p>As a young woman in a male­dom­i­nated business, she faced scep­ti­cism.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple said I wouldn’t last a year,” she re­calls. “But I won them over with my de­ter­mi­na­tion and hard work, as well as a heart for the peo­ple who worked with me.”</p>
    <p>To­day, the 42-year-old mother of four heads X-Inc, a diver­si­fied group with busi­nesses i n food, plan­ta­tion, lo­gis­tics and prop­erty.</p>
    <p>She is also ac­tive in char­ity work. She is pres­i­dent of One Sin­ga­pore, a char­ity ded­i­cated to erad­i­cat­ing poverty.</p>
    <p>In 2012, she co-founded The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore, which re­dis­tributes still-good-to-eat food to non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions. To mark World Food Day on Oct 16, it is en­gag­ing car clubs and will­ing driv­ers to de­liver food items to the needy.</p>
    <p>With that much on her plate, as well as hav­ing to raise three girls and a boy aged be­tween 11 months and seven years old, Ms Ng says car jour­neys have be­come op­por­tu­ni­ties to bond with her chil­dren.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently three cars at home: a Porsche 911 Car­rera Cabri­o­let, a Porsche Cayenne sport util­ity ve­hi­cle (SUV) and a MercedesBe­nz Viano mini­van.</p>
    <p>But it is the 911 Cabri­o­let, which she bought for $395,000 from its first owner in 2016, which gets the most at­ten­tion. “It is a car where the kids and I can go crazy in with the top down, singing and wav­ing our hands in the air,” she says.</p>
    <p>She has had a soft spot for soft­tops since her first, a MercedesBe­nz CLK Cabri­o­let, which she pur­chased in 2006.</p>
    <p>The 911 Cabri­o­let is her daily com­mute when her hus­band, a 44-yearold flight at­ten­dant and event host, is away. She fer­ries her three older chil­dren to school in it and has even trans­ported an of­fice chair in it.</p>
    <p>She also uses the car to get to the of­fice, business meet­ings and the su­per­mar­ket. “I see the car as an ex­ten­sion of my busy life­style. It’s a great ev­ery­day sports car that’s pow­er­ful, but also such an easy and com­fort­able drive.”</p>
    <p>When her hus­band is in town, he drives the 911 Cabri­o­let and takes over the school runs while she takes the back seat in the Viano, which is chauf­feur-driven.</p>
    <p>Nick­named “The Magic School Bus”, the Viano is able to ac­com­mo­date the en­tire ex­tended fam­ily of 10, in­clud­ing Ms Ng’s mother, grandaunt and two helpers.</p>
    <p>The Cayenne is driven pri­mar­ily by her mother.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng re­cently placed a de­posit for a Jeep Gla­di­a­tor Ru­bi­con – a re­cently launched SUV-cum­flatbed truck.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways wanted a rough and tough car,” she says. “The Gla­di­a­tor is a proper off-roader, yet com­fort­able enough. We can load it up with the kids’ bikes and stuff.”</p>
    <p>Fur­ther down the road, the busy chief ex­ec­u­tive says she will go back to driv­ing a con­vert­ible. But this time, a more re­gal one.</p>
    <p>“The Bent­ley Con­ti­nen­tal GT Con­vert­ible will be my re­tire­ment car. Maybe in my 60s,” she says.</p>
    <p>What’s in the boot?</p>
    <p>• A child seat</p>
    <p>• A pair of run­ning shoes</p>
    <p>• A pack of wet wipes</p>
    <p>• Food items to be dropped off at The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore</p>
