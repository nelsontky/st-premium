    <p>About 91 per cent of those di­ag­nosed with the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus (HIV) here are re­ceiv­ing sus­tained an­tiretro­vi­ral ther­apy for it, and 91 per cent of this group have sup­pressed the virus.</p>
    <p>This ex­ceeds two of the United Na­tions’ three “90-90-90” goals, the Health Min­istry’s direc­tor of com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases Ver­non Lee said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore still falls short of the third goal, which is to have 90 per cent of all peo­ple liv­ing with HIV know their sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the 12th Sin­ga­pore Aids Con­fer­ence, held vir­tu­ally this year, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lee said only 80 per cent of HIV-pos­i­tive peo­ple here have been di­ag­nosed.</p>
    <p>This num­ber was cal­cu­lated us­ing data from the na­tional HIV reg­istry data­base and mod­elled us­ing a tool that the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Disease Preven­tion and Con­trol uses.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee said Sin­ga­pore’s 80 per cent statis­tic for this goal is around the global av­er­age, while the Repub­lic has gen­er­ally sur­passed other re­gions with its achieve­ments for the other two tar­gets.</p>
    <p>He also noted that Sin­ga­pore has pro­gressed in terms of the per­cent­age of peo­ple who have HIV that have been di­ag­nosed, which has in­creased ev­ery year, up from 66 per cent in 2014.</p>
    <p>“The progress we have made in terms of get­ting peo­ple tested and di­ag­nosed with HIV has im­proved across the years, but this is some­thing that we need to con­tinue to push be­cause we want peo­ple to get di­ag­nosed so that they can move to­wards treat­ment and vi­ral sup­pres­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The per­cent­age for the three groups was cal­cu­lated based on data from 2018, as it takes sev­eral years for it to be pro­cessed. So it is not yet clear if Sin­ga­pore will meet the UN’s goals for this year.</p>
    <p>But Pro­fes­sor Roy Chan, pres­i­dent of Ac­tion for Aids Sin­ga­pore, said hit­ting the UN’s tar­gets is not as im­por­tant as see­ing an im­prove­ment over time.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tant thing for us to un­der­stand is – are we do­ing bet­ter? Ninety per cent is (just) the first tar­get... We can do much bet­ter than this; I think as a small coun­try we can hit 95 per cent,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Chan, who is also a se­nior con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Skin Cen­tre and head of its Sex­u­ally Trans­mit­ted In­fec­tion Con­trol Pro­gramme, said there is a need to re­duce the stig­ma­ti­sa­tion of peo­ple liv­ing with HIV, and also to cor­rect the mis­un­der­stand­ing that treat­ment is ex­pen­sive. He added that self-test­ing kits could help re­duce fear.</p>
    <p>Prof Chan said: “We have some ways to go, and it’s the job of every­body... to work to­gether to try and get this done.”</p>
