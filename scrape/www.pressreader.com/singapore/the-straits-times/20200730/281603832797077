    <p>Sin­ga­pore is now see­ing a third wave of im­ported Covid-19 cases, with more than 100 such cases con­firmed in the past month. These make up about 15.5 per cent of the total num­ber of im­ported cases here since the start of the out­break in Jan­uary. As of Tues­day, 688 im­ported cases had been con­firmed.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is now see­ing a third wave of im­ported Covid-19 cases, with more than 100 such cases con­firmed in the past month.</p>
    <p>These make up about 15.5 per cent of the total num­ber of im­ported cases here since the start of the out­break in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>As of Tues­day, a total of 688 im­ported cases of Covid-19 had been con­firmed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily im­ported cases had ear­lier dropped to zero as travel re­stric­tions tight­ened here and around the world.</p>
    <p>But on June 15, the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19 here an­nounced that more long-term pass hold­ers would be able to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore dur­ing phase two of the coun­try’s re­open­ing, which be­gan on June 19.</p>
    <p>On June 30, the Repub­lic saw its first im­ported case in more than two weeks.</p>
    <p>An­other 106 cases fol­lowed up un­til Tues­day, and they were im­ported from nine dif­fer­ent coun­tries, with more than half – 62 cases – com­ing from In­dia.</p>
    <p>In­dia has seen a rapid rise in Covid-19 in­fec­tions, with more than 1.5 mil­lion con­firmed cases, and nearly 35,000 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An­other 23 cases were im­ported from the Philip­pines, which also saw a re­cent coron­avirus surge, while the rest came from coun­tries such as In­done­sia, Pak­istan and the United States.</p>
    <p>Most of the im­ported cases – 27 – are work pass hold­ers, while 23 of them are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>There were 20 per­ma­nent res­i­dents and 19 de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers among the im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>The in­crease in cases has prompted some Straits Times readers to ask why trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore are not tested for Covid-19 upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, trav­ellers have to get ap­proval be­fore en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore, serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) upon ar­rival, and are swabbed for the coron­avirus a few days be­fore their SHN pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>They should travel from their place of res­i­dence to the des­ig­nated test­ing fa­cil­ity, and re­turn im­me­di­ately af­ter the test, us­ing a pri­vate ve­hi­cle. They are also ad­vised to avoid tak­ing pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts had ear­lier said peo­ple who are in­fected may not test pos­i­tive dur­ing the early stages of their ill­ness due to a low vi­ral load.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, sug­gested yes­ter­day that coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore may con­sider swab­bing trav­ellers on ar­rival in­stead of quar­an­tin­ing them.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “This would still help fil­ter out the ma­jor­ity of in­fected trav­ellers, save money and in­con­ve­nience re­lated to quar­an­tine, and could po­ten­tially lower the risk of spread to the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion, since those test­ing pos­i­tive could then be iso­lated at hos­pi­tal or a fa­cil­ity.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added that quar­an­tine is an ef­fec­tive way of com­bat­ing the spread caused by im­ported cases. He noted that Sin­ga­pore went</p>
    <p>The les­son we learnt from that se­cond wave was that it is vi­tal to en­sure that in­fected cases are quar­an­tined in a way that min­imises the risk of spillover. As long as we con­tinue to keep new ar­rivals sep­a­rated from the com­mu­nity, then it’s not a ’’ con­cern.</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR ALEX COOK, not­ing that Sin­ga­pore had two waves of im­ported cases be­fore the cur­rent one, and that quar­an­tine is an ef­fec­tive mea­sure.</p>
    <p>through two waves of im­ported cases be­fore the cur­rent one – an ini­tial wave of cases from Wuhan, and a larger one in March from ar­eas like Europe and coun­tries like the US that pre­ceded a wave of com­mu­nity cases which led to the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>“The les­son we learnt from that se­cond wave was that it is vi­tal to en­sure that in­fected cases are quar­an­tined in a way that min­imises the risk of spillover. As long as we con­tinue to keep new ar­rivals sep­a­rated from the com­mu­nity, then it’s not a con­cern,” he said, adding that any home-based quar­an­tine regime would need to be rig­or­ously en­forced.</p>
