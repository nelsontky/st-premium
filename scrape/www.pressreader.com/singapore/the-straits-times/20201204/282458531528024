    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Ta­ble Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion (ITTF) has re­futed al­le­ga­tions made by the Ger­man Ta­ble Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion (DTTB) over the gov­er­nance of the former’s Sin­ga­pore-based com­mer­cial arm World Ta­ble Ten­nis (WTT).</p>
    <p>Launched in March, the WTT will run all of the ITTF’s com­mer­cial and events busi­nesses from next year.</p>
    <p>Its first event was the pro­mo­tional show­case WTT Ma­cau held from Nov 25 to 29, but in a Nov 18 let­ter sent to the ITTF fra­ter­nity, the DTTB ques­tioned the ba­sis in which the WTT was formed.</p>
    <p>The DTTB – whose former pres­i­dent Thomas Weik­ert, 59, has been the ITTF pres­i­dent since 2014 – said na­tional govern­ing bod­ies were not privy to how much power the WTT would have.</p>
    <p>It claimed the WTT has “full con­trol” over in­ter­na­tional tour­na­ments and can sell the rights with­out con­sult­ing the ITTF’s con­ti­nen­tal fed­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>It also al­leged that the WTT’s struc­ture could make it vul­ner­a­ble to ac­count­abil­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the WTT has nine staff on its pay­roll, while the Lau­sanne-based ITTF, which has an Asia-Pa­cific and mar­ket­ing of­fice in Sin­ga­pore, has 60 paid staff.</p>
    <p>While the ITTF re­jected the al­le­ga­tions in a state­ment sent to The Straits Times on Tues­day, it has since in­tro­duced two groups to en­sure neu­tral­ity and greater com­mu­ni­ca­tion among stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The first will be led by three in­de­pen­dently elected ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee mem­bers and two staff, who were not in­volved in the WTT se­lec­tion panel, to en­sure in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>This group will work with au­dit­ing firm Deloitte and law firm Withers, in­cor­po­rate an ex­ter­nal ex­pert and pro­vide a re­sponse to the DTTB’s let­ter and share the find­ings with ITTF mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond group, with an­other three ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee mem­bers, will en­gage Euro­pean mem­ber as­so­ci­a­tions to ob­tain feed­back and lis­ten to any con­cerns re­gard­ing the DTTB’s let­ter. It is un­der­stood that this is be­cause the ini­tial con­cerns were raised by a cou­ple of Euro­pean as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The sport’s world govern­ing body – which has 226 mem­ber as­so­ci­a­tions – also re­counted the process it went through to form the WTT in a de­ci­sion made in 2018, in view of the ITTF’s com­mer­cial rights con­tract end­ing by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The ITTF said: “The process of de­vel­op­ment and cre­ation of WTT was char­ac­terised by trans­parency and pro­fes­sion­al­ism, in­clud­ing the en­gage­ment of two world-re­puted firms, Deloitte Sport Busi­ness Group and Withers, to as­sist us in iden­ti­fy­ing the best pos­si­ble busi­ness model in light of sim­i­lar de­vel­op­ments in other sports.”</p>
    <p>It added that a com­mer­cial rights ten­der was launched in Fe­bru­ary last year to seek in­ter­est from over 50 in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies to be­come WTT strate­gic part­ners and share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>It also in­sisted that its stake­hold­ers were kept in the loop through phys­i­cal and on­line “in­for­ma­tion ses­sions”, and reg­u­lar e-mail com­mu­ni­ca­tions, “which led to the rat­i­fi­ca­tion of the work” made by the ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee at the ITTF an­nual gen­eral meet­ing on Sept 28.</p>
    <p>Un­der the WTT, a new event struc­ture will see a to­tal prize purse of US$13 mil­lion (S$17.3 mil­lion) a year, more than dou­ble the pre­vi­ous amount. Mod­elled af­ter ten­nis’ Grand Slams, the top tier will com­prise four US$2 mil­lion to US$3 mil­lion Grand Smash tour­na­ments.</p>
    <p>ITTF chief ex­ec­u­tive Steve Dainton called it a “huge project that will rev­o­lu­tionise” the sport, and added: “Through WTT, we are en­deav­our­ing to build a plat­form that re­ally ben­e­fits our ath­letes and fans, en­abling bet­ter struc­tured events and higher prize money.”</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate mes­sage on the ITTF web­site, he said: “Although some still are con­cerned about our tra­jec­tory, sim­ply we need to con­tinue to show the world that hard work, pas­sion, pro­fes­sion­al­ism and most im­por­tantly en­sur­ing that ev­ery­thing we do has ta­ble ten­nis as the main in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>“If we al­ways en­sure that then we will prove that we are on the right path­way.”</p>
    <p>We need to con­tinue to show the world that hard work, pas­sion, pro­fes­sion­al­ism and ... en­sur­ing that ev­ery­thing we do has ta­ble ten­nis as the main in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>STEVE DAINTON, ITTF chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
