    <p>I re­fer to Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh’s opin­ion piece (Young vot­ers and women power, July 17).</p>
    <p>In it, Prof Koh re­ferred to an anal­y­sis I wrote for East Asia Fo­rum ti­tled PAP’s Self-In­flicted Elec­tion Losses that was pub­lished on Tues­day last week.</p>
    <p>I thank him for bring­ing at­ten­tion to my anal­y­sis. I have been hon­oured to work with Prof Koh on a col­lab­o­ra­tive project in the past and con­tinue to re­spect his work and com­pas­sion.</p>
    <p>We dif­fer, how­ever, on how my post-elec­tion anal­y­sis has been char­ac­terised. Prof Koh has fo­cused on two words, “hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat”, re­fer­ring to the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s (PAP) per­for­mance in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Prof Koh took these words out of con­text, and in do­ing so, mis­rep­re­sented my anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>My orig­i­nal text read: “This would be a land­slide vic­tory in most democ­ra­cies. But the nu­mer­i­cal ma­jor­ity in ac­tu­al­ity sug­gests a rather hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat, es­pe­cially in a ‘cri­sis’ elec­tion called early amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Prof Koh went on to write “any fair-minded per­son would con­clude that it was an out­stand­ing vic­tory. It was cer­tainly not a ‘disas­ter’ or a ‘hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat’”.</p>
    <p>This un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally per­son­alised the dis­cus­sion, sug­gest­ing that those who do have a dif­fer­ent con­clu­sion are not “fair-minded”.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve the fo­cus should be on the ar­gu­ments.</p>
    <p>In fact, a com­par­i­son of our pieces shows that we agree on many points.</p>
    <p>We agreed that else­where, these re­sults would be im­pres­sive vic­to­ries. In fact, I used the word “land­slide”.</p>
    <p>We agreed that the use of at­tacks on the op­po­si­tion hurt the PAP’s per­for­mance. We both used two sim­i­lar ex­am­ples in our ar­gu­ments.</p>
    <p>We fur­ther agreed that the PAP needs to en­gage in­equal­ity and fair­ness.</p>
    <p>We do dis­agree. I sug­gest that Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is unique and should be as­sessed on its own terms.</p>
    <p>I do not think a com­par­i­son be­tween Sin­ga­pore and the coun­tries he cited – the United King­dom, Aus­tralia and In­dia – are a fair com­par­i­son, as they do not have a legacy of more than 55 years of one-party rule. Their elec­tions also did not oc­cur dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Healthy de­bate on GE2020 strength­ens Sin­ga­pore. Rather than use la­bels such as “out­siders”, a more con­struc­tive ap­proach would be to en­gage al­ter­na­tive views – a po­si­tion that Prof Koh has of­ten ar­gued for in the past, and I wish him well in do­ing so in the fu­ture.</p>
