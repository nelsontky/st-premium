    <p>China yes­ter­day re­futed al­le­ga­tions that it re­cruited Sin­ga­porean Dick­son Yeo Jun Wei as a spy, and in­stead ac­cused the United States of hav­ing reached “a state of ex­treme sus­pi­cion”.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to ques­tions from The Straits Times at a daily briefing in Bei­jing, Foreign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin de­nied knowl­edge of Yeo’s pros­e­cu­tion in the US.</p>
    <p>“But what I want to say is this. In a bid to smear China, US law en­force­ment has re­peat­edly made ac­cu­sa­tions about Chi­nese es­pi­onage ac­tiv­i­ties,” said Mr Wang.</p>
    <p>“It has reached a state of ex­treme sus­pi­cion. We ask the US to stop this, and to stop us­ing the is­sue of es­pi­onage to con­tinue smear­ing China.”</p>
    <p>This is the lat­est in the down­ward spi­ral of di­plo­matic re­la­tions be­tween both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Both sides have lev­elled ac­cu­sa­tions of spy­ing against the other, and or­dered the clo­sure of con­sulates in tit-for-tat moves.</p>
    <p>The US had abruptly or­dered shut the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, Texas, say­ing that it had been at the heart of China’s mil­i­tary and in­dus­trial es­pi­onage ef­forts.</p>
    <p>In re­tal­i­a­tion, China shut the Amer­i­can mis­sion in Chengdu, also ac­cus­ing staff of “en­gag­ing in ac­tiv­i­ties not in line with their iden­ti­ties”, a ref­er­ence to clan­des­tine op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Yeo, 39, last Friday pleaded guilty in the United States to one count of act­ing within the coun­try as an il­le­gal foreign agent.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment of facts sub­mit­ted to the court and signed by Yeo, he ad­mit­ted to be­ing fully aware he was work­ing for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence, meet­ing with agents dozens of times and be­ing given spe­cial treat­ment when he trav­elled to China.</p>
    <p>He set up a po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy in the US in 2018, which he used as a front to col­lect in­for­ma­tion for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence ser­vices, court doc­u­ments showed.</p>
    <p>Yeo spot­ted and as­sessed Amer­i­cans with ac­cess to valu­able non­pub­lic in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing Amer­i­can mil­i­tary and govern­ment em­ploy­ees with high-level se­cu­rity clear­ance.</p>
    <p>He used var­i­ous so­cial me­dia plat­forms for this, in­clud­ing pro­fes­sional net­work­ing site LinkedIn.</p>
    <p>Yeo would pay his re­cruits to write re­ports that he said were meant for clients in Asia, but were ac­tu­ally sent to the Chi­nese govern­ment.</p>
    <p>He en­rolled in 2015 as a PhD stu­dent at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy (LKYSPP) in Sin­ga­pore, where he re­searched China’s frame­work of treat­ment for small states along its Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive tra­jec­tory, ac­cord­ing to the school’s web­site.</p>
    <p>In­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives re­cruited Yeo in 2015 dur­ing a visit to Bei­jing, where he gave a pre­sen­ta­tion on the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Be­tween June 2016 and Jan­uary last year, while still at LKYSPP, Yeo vis­ited Bei­jing as a re­searcher at Pek­ing Univer­sity’s Na­tional In­sti­tute of Strate­gic Com­mu­ni­ca­tion, ac­cord­ing to his LinkedIn pro­file. The page has since been taken down.</p>
    <p>He later listed him­self as a doc­toral fel­low “work­ing on the foreign pol­icy of smaller strate­gic states in light of US-China com­pe­ti­tion” at The Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity in Wash­ing­ton from Jan­uary to July last year.</p>
    <p>Yeo, who is in cus­tody, is set to be sen­tenced on Oct 9.</p>
    <p>CHENGDU (Sichuan) • Bei­jing took over the premises of the United States con­sulate in the south-western city of Chengdu yes­ter­day, af­ter or­der­ing the fa­cil­ity to be va­cated in re­tal­i­a­tion for China be­ing ousted last week from its con­sulate in Hous­ton, Texas.</p>
    <p>The seizure capped a dra­matic es­ca­la­tion in ten­sions be­tween the world’s two largest economies, which be­gan when em­ploy­ees at China’s Hous­ton con­sulate were seen burn­ing doc­u­ments in a court­yard last Tues­day, hours be­fore Bei­jing an­nounced that it had been or­dered to leave the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The US con­sulate in Chengdu, in Sichuan province, was closed as of 10am yes­ter­day, and the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties had en­tered the building from the front door, China’s Min­istry of Foreign Af­fairs said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Last Friday, Bei­jing an­nounced that it had asked the US to close its Chengdu post, and gave the Amer­i­cans 72 hours to va­cate, the same amount of time China was given to leave its Hous­ton mis­sion, which was shut the same day.</p>
    <p>A US State Depart­ment spokesman said in an e-mail to Reuters: “We are dis­ap­pointed by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s de­ci­sion and will strive to con­tinue our out­reach to the peo­ple in this im­por­tant re­gion through our other posts in China.”</p>
    <p>At mid­day yes­ter­day, the po­lice re­moved a road­block that had re­stricted ac­cess to the Chengdu fa­cil­ity, and dozens of passers-by stopped to take pho­tos and videos.</p>
    <p>One man stood across the street and played the Chi­nese na­tional an­them from his phone.</p>
    <p>Grey sheet-like ma­te­rial was placed over the spot near the en­trance where a plaque had been af­fixed, and over the place where there was large let­ter­ing that said “US Con­sulate Gen­eral”.</p>
    <p>The US em­bassy is­sued a video in Chi­nese on its Twit­ter feed.</p>
    <p>It said: “The US con­sulate in</p>
    <p>Chengdu has been proudly pro­mot­ing the mu­tual un­der­stand­ing be­tween Amer­i­cans and the peo­ple in Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Yun­nan and Ti­bet since 1985. We will for­ever miss you.”</p>
    <p>On Sun­day night, a crane was seen en­ter­ing the con­sulate com­pound and hoist­ing at least one con­tainer onto a large truck.</p>
    <p>The Chengdu con­sulate opened in 1985 and had al­most 200 em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing about 150 lo­cally hired staff, ac­cord­ing to its web­site. It was not im­me­di­ately clear how many had been work­ing there at the time of its clo­sure, af­ter Amer­i­can diplo­mats were evac­u­ated from China be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>US-China re­la­tions have plunged to their worst level in decades over a range of dis­putes, from trade and tech­nol­ogy to the Covid-19 pan­demic, as well as China’s ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea and its na­tional se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo gave a speech call­ing a more as­sertive ap­proach to China the “mis­sion of our time”.</p>
