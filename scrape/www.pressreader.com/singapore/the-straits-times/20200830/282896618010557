    <p>Leas­ing ac­tiv­ity re­mained muted dur­ing the se­cond quar­ter as bro­kers were un­able to close deals dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The de­mand for new of­fice space in the near term is likely to re­main weak be­cause re­mote work­ing is con­tin­u­ing to be the de­fault mode of op­er­a­tion, even af­ter the cir­cuit breaker. Also, cor­po­rate oc­cu­piers are putting the brakes on ex­pan­sion plans to han­dle op­er­a­tional is­sues aris­ing from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In the long term, there are con­cerns there could be a struc­tural shift in the mar­ket if banks and tech firms opt to save on real es­tate costs and let a large pro­por­tion of their work­force con­tinue re­mote work­ing post-pan­demic, which could lead to lower of­fice de­mand.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, many banks have in­di­cated there would be an ad­just­ment to their lo­ca­tion strat­egy and they would be reeval­u­at­ing their space needs.</p>
    <p>Large tech firms have al­ready made pub­lic com­mit­ments, with Twit­ter and Square an­nounc­ing that all em­ploy­ees would be able to work from home in­def­i­nitely, while Face­book un­veiled a plan for up to half of its 48,000 work­ers to telecom­mute per­ma­nently within the decade.</p>
    <p>Rental re­duc­tions are starting, with Grade A Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict rents mod­er­at­ing by 2.3 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter to $10.37 per sq ft per month in the se­cond quar­ter of this year. The de­cline is more pro­nounced in the most ex­pen­sive build­ings, lead­ing to Ma­rina Bay fall­ing by 3.4 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter to $12.20 per sq ft per month.</p>
    <p>Due to the lim­ited leas­ing ac­tiv­ity in the se­cond quar­ter, a larger moder­a­tion in rents is ex­pected in the third quar­ter as land­lords com­pete to at­tract and re­tain key tenants.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the peak-totrough rental de­cline is likely to be milder than that of previous re­ces­sions, par­tially due to the Govern­ment’s un­prece­dented stim­u­lus pack­age.</p>
    <p>Other mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors in­clude the ex­pan­sion of the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sec­tor, lead­ing to a spillover in cor­po­rate space re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, there is also a tight sup­ply sit­u­a­tion, with an an­nual av­er­age sup­ply of only 0.7 mil­lion sq ft en­ter­ing the mar­ket in the pe­riod of 2020 to 2021, sig­nif­i­cantly l ower than the 2010-2019 an­nual av­er­age of 1.2 mil­lion sq ft.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Alibaba is en­ter­ing into a joint ven­ture with a Peren­nial-led con­sor­tium to re­de­velop AXA Tower, which will re­sult in the dis­place­ment of tenants oc­cu­py­ing 700,000 sq ft of space.</p>
    <p>SCE­NAR­IOS AS­SESS­MENT</p>
    <p>Land­lords with low va­cancy rates and a low num­ber of up­com­ing leases ex­piry will be able to re­tain tenants and main­tain healthy rental lev­els, as tenants tend to be less mo­bile dur­ing un­cer­tain times.</p>
    <p>But land­lords with low va­cancy rates and a high num­ber of up­com­ing leases ex­pir­ing in 2020/2021 will be able to re­tain an­chor tenants while main­tain­ing healthy rental lev­els as such tenants tend to be less mo­bile, while of­fer­ing a mod­er­ate in­crease in re­newal rent for the smaller tenants.</p>
    <p>Those with leases with 12 to 18 months to go would be mo­ti­vated to of­fer in­cen­tives to at­tract new tenants. There are likely to be ef­forts to proac­tively cross-sell prop­er­ties within their own port­fo­lio as­sets.</p>
    <p>Land­lords with high ex­po­sure, high va­cancy rates and build­ings un­der con­struc­tion will need to se­cure the first an­chor ten­ant and ramp up oc­cu­pancy rates. To at­tract new tenants, more will be pre­pared to of­fer longer fit-out pe­ri­ods, in­cen­tives and re­siz­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, we see higher lev­els of re­newals rather than new leases, which re­quire large fit-out costs up­front, as com­pa­nies fo­cus on cost con­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, re­newal rental rates are more re­silient, while rents for new leases have ex­pe­ri­enced a larger de­crease. How­ever, the dis­par­ity is ex­pected to nar­row in the fu­ture, es­pe­cially if land­lords start of­fer­ing in­cen­tives for new leases.</p>
