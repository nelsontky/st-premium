    <p>Ever­ton’s Premier League match at home to Manch­ester City yes­ter­day was post­poned ow­ing to fresh Covid-19 cases at City, the clubs an­nounced.</p>
    <p>City re­turned a num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases after con­firm­ing four pos­i­tives on Christ­mas Day, which in­cluded striker Gabriel Je­sus and de­fender Kyle Walker and two staff mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the BBC, more pos­i­tive test results have been re­turned at the club in the lat­est round of test­ing.</p>
    <p>The club have now closed their first-team train­ing ground.</p>
    <p>A Manch­ester City state­ment read: “With the se­cu­rity of the bubble com­pro­mised, there posed a risk that the virus could spread fur­ther among the squad, the staff and po­ten­tially beyond.</p>
    <p>“Based on strong med­i­cal ad­vice, the Premier League, in con­sul­ta­tion with both clubs, have de­cided to post­pone the fix­ture.</p>
    <p>“All pos­i­tive cases in­volv­ing play­ers and staff will ob­serve a pe­riod of self-isolation in ac­cor­dance with Premier League and UK gov­ern­ment pro­to­col on quar­an­tine.”</p>
    <p>City, sixth in the league ta­ble, could have moved into the top four with vic­tory yes­ter­day and are sched­uled to face Chelsea at Stam­ford Bridge on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>A win for the Tof­fees at Good­i­son Park would have taken them level on points with city ri­vals and lead­ers Liverpool.</p>
    <p>It is the sec­ond Premier League match to be called off due to a coro­n­avirus out­break this sea­son, after the Dec 4 fix­ture be­tween As­ton Villa and New­cas­tle. Sev­eral games in the English Foot­ball League have also been post­poned dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A Premier League state­ment said: “Manch­ester City lodged a re­quest with the Premier League to­day to rear­range the match fol­low­ing an in­crease in pos­i­tive Covid-19 test results re­ceived by the club this morn­ing, on top of the cases re­ported on Christ­mas Day.</p>
    <p>“This rise has cre­ated un­cer­tainty and the Premier League Board re­ceived med­i­cal ad­vice that the match should be post­poned. The board agreed to rear­range the game as a pre­cau­tion, and fur­ther test­ing will now take place to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s early match, Crys­tal Palace drew 1-1 with Leices­ter City at Sel­hurst Park.</p>
    <p>The hosts opened the scor­ing in the 58th minute through Wil­fried Zaha after Leices­ter striker Kelechi Iheana­cho saw his 19thminute penalty saved by Vi­cente Guaita. But Har­vey Barnes equalised with seven min­utes left to leave Leices­ter sec­ond.</p>
