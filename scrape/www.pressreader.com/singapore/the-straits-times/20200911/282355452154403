    <p>What was sup­posed to be a mo­men­tous high­light quickly turned into a night­mare.</p>
    <p>When 27-year-old London-based so­ci­ety fix­ture Nga Nguyen was in­vited to her first Gucci show ear­lier this year, she was ec­static.</p>
    <p>With her sis­ter Nguyen Hong Nhung, 26, in tow, she flew into Mi­lan on Feb 18 to catch the Ital­ian brand’s Fall/Win­ter 2020 col­lec­tion. A week later, the pair made another whirl­wind trip to Paris – this time, to at­tend the Saint Lau­rent show.</p>
    <p>Another week passed be­fore the hor­ror be­gan.</p>
    <p>At a rou­tine med­i­cal check-up on a busi­ness trip to Europe, a mild cough led Ms Nguyen to un­dergo a Covid-19 test. The pos­i­tive re­sult that came back marked the start of a har­row­ing month as the ini­tial fever and cough gave way to suf­fo­cat­ing chest pains and breath­ing com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s like some­one’s press­ing on your chest. You can’t even lie on your side. Just breath­ing or get­ting up to go to the bathroom was so dif­fi­cult,” Ms Nguyen re­calls.</p>
    <p>It took two weeks of ag­gres­sive treat­ment in a hos­pi­tal and two neg­a­tive tests be­fore she was fi­nally in the clear.</p>
    <p>As her health was hurt by the coro­n­avirus, her pub­lic per­sona took a bat­ter­ing as well.</p>
    <p>Heiress to a prop­erty busi­ness that spans Viet­nam, London and Ger­many, Ms Nguyen has al­ways been close to the fash­ion world.</p>
    <p>An early stint in the mar­ket­ing depart­ment of LVMH’s per­fume and cos­met­ics di­vi­sion, fol­lowed by a role at the Prince Al­bert II of Monaco Foun­da­tion or­gan­is­ing its yearly galas, put her in close con­tact with the glit­terati of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In 2018, she at­tended the Met Gala, the an­nual Met­ro­pol­i­tan Mu­seum of Art ball that is also known as fash­ion’s big­gest night. She has been a guest at Dolce & Gab­bana’s highly ex­clu­sive Alta Moda shows – days-long ex­trav­a­gan­zas at spec­tac­u­lar Ital­ian lo­cales, where the brand’s clients spend mil­lions on its cou­ture.</p>
    <p>Ms Nguyen doc­u­mented all these ex­pe­ri­ences and more on her In­sta­gram feed. That same fast, fab­u­lous life that earned her a size­able so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing gar­nered vit­riol when it was re­vealed that she had con­tracted Covid-19.</p>
    <p>With fear, re­sent­ment and un­cer­tainty run­ning high, she came to sig­nify all the ex­cesses of the fash­ion in­dus­try that seemed out of step with the re­al­i­ties of a pan­demic – the con­stant gal­li­vant­ing around the globe, the end­less con­sump­tion and dis­play of lux­ury.</p>
    <p>The press and the In­ter­net went into at­tack mode, with Ms Nguyen and her sis­ter pil­lo­ried the world over.</p>
    <p>“That was a truly dif­fi­cult episode. Phys­i­cally, you’re sick, you’re far away from home, you’re alone in the hos­pi­tal, and men­tally, you’re not at ease be­cause you’re deal­ing with all this neg­a­tiv­ity and cy­ber drama. It makes the whole ex­pe­ri­ence and re­cov­ery much, much harder,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I turned off all my so­cial me­dia, just to fo­cus com­pletely on my health.”</p>
    <p>In truth, the al­le­ga­tions that Ms Nguyen trig­gered new clus­ters in the fash­ion world were largely un­founded.</p>
    <p>“I was in Mi­lan and Paris for only 24 hours each. I didn’t go to any par­ties or af­ter-par­ties,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Right af­ter my di­ag­no­sis, I called the brands and they in­formed all</p>
    <p>the guests who were seated around me. I haven’t heard of any of them con­tract­ing the virus. The peo­ple who were with me on those trips – my pho­tog­ra­pher and make-up artist – tested neg­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing re­cov­ered from both the virus and the back­lash, she finds her­self in a much bet­ter place nowa­days.</p>
    <p>“You know what they say; what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. What I find very im­por­tant in sit­u­a­tions like that is that you re­main calm,” says Ms Nguyen on how she got through that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Tune out the neg­a­tiv­ity and the fake news, and just try to find the truth – ab­sorb what’s good or what’s rel­e­vant for you. Get to a log­i­cal com­pre­hen­sion of your sit­u­a­tion: How did you get there and what are you go­ing to do about it?”</p>
    <p>For Ms Nguyen, that has meant re­think­ing the way she lives. “I’ve al­ways lived quite a chaotic life.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “Now that ev­ery­thing has slowed down, it has been a process of self-reflection. It’s a time to press re­set and ques­tion not just the way we live, but go deeper. What’s the pur­pose of do­ing the things we do? What makes us happy? What’s mean­ing­ful to us?”</p>
    <p>This new mind­set ex­tends to her re­la­tion­ship with fash­ion as well.</p>
    <p>“We’re bom­barded with this enor­mous amount of col­lec­tions. As a fash­ion lover, I re­ally value the cre­ativ­ity shown, but do we need four sea­sons?” she says.</p>
    <p>“What would be the most ef­fi­cient way to main­tain this showcase of cre­ativ­ity with­out los­ing the con­sumer’s at­ten­tion and los­ing sight of the new nor­mal af­ter the pan­demic?”</p>
    <p>As she pon­ders how fash­ion would change post-Covid-19, she is sure that her be­havioural habits, along with those of count­less other con­sumers, would shift.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore, we like to just pur­chase, but per­haps now, we’re hun­gry for more un­der­stand­ing. Not only will we pay more at­ten­tion to what we buy, but we’re also go­ing to fo­cus on the story be­hind the prod­uct, why we’re buy­ing it and what it means – not just the fi­nan­cial value,</p>
    <p>but also the emo­tional value. I think we’ll be mak­ing smarter choices.”</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to turn her trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ence into some­thing more mean­ing­ful, Ms Nguyen is launch­ing a new ven­ture later this year: Never Go Alone, a line of pre­mium per­sonal hy­giene prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Like ev­ery­thing she does, it will be in high style – the col­lec­tion will be mar­keted as fash­ion­able ac­ces­sories with a high-per­for­mance el­e­ment.</p>
    <p>“A lot of re­search has gone into it, ev­ery­thing will be sus­tain­ably pack­aged, we’re sup­port­ing (com­mu­nity ini­tia­tive) The Hy­giene Bank to tackle hy­giene poverty in the United King­dom and 20 per cent of our first-year prof­its will go to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Covid-19 Sol­i­dar­ity Re­sponse Fund,” she says.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Hy­giene Bank, hy­giene poverty is not be­ing able to af­ford the ev­ery­day hy­giene and per­sonal groom­ing prod­ucts most peo­ple take for granted, from de­odor­ant to sham­poo.</p>
    <p>Ms Nguyen adds: “Be­fore this, I treated the plat­form I had as a play­ground – purely for en­ter­tain­ment and never think­ing too much about it.</p>
    <p>“Now, I re­alise that I can use it to pro­mote change and a pos­i­tive mes­sage. I had to deal with the virus com­pletely alone and it made me stronger. But that also in­spired the idea be­hind this project – that wherever you are or what­ever your jour­ney, you never have to go it alone.”</p>
