    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer be­lieves Manch­ester United have the squad depth to com­pete this sea­son, de­spite a lack of new ar­rivals in the trans­fer mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The United boss had stressed the need for new sign­ings after United’s 2-1 de­feat by Sevilla in the Europa League semi-fi­nals last sea­son, but Dutch mid­fielder Donny van de Beek re­mains the Premier League club’s only sign­ing of the win­dow.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got play­ers we be­lieve in,” he told re­porters ahead of to­day’s Premier League home clash against Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur. “The win­dow is still open and the club know my view and we’re here to strengthen in the long term.</p>
    <p>“When I talk about the squad depth, of course the per­for­mances last sea­son didn’t war­rant me giv­ing more of them more op­tions... I think it’s a dif­fer­ent sce­nario now.</p>
    <p>“I’ve seen many of the other play­ers who didn’t play too well the other sea­son, play re­ally well. We’ve lost loads of money, as the other clubs have as well. And when I talk about the squad depth, we’ve got a big squad.”</p>
    <p>United’s plan to sign Eng­land for­ward Jadon San­cho from Borus­sia Dort­mund re­mains i n li mbo as both clubs could not agree on a fee. The trans­fer win­dow closes to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Solskjaer and Spurs boss Jose Mour­inho have traded digs in the lead-up to to­day’s game, but the Nor­we­gian in­sisted he would not be drawn into fur­ther mind games.</p>
    <p>“Jose has through­out the years given us some fan­tas­tic mo­ments in foot­ball, in press con­fer­ences and on the pitch,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We are in strange times. You’ve got to some­times have a bit of fun. Jose’s a very charis­matic coach and I’ve en­joyed in the me­dia talk­ing to him, en­joyed watch­ing him. I’ve got ul­ti­mate re­spect for him as a coach and ev­ery­thing he’s given foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>Solskjaer also con­firmed Harry Maguire, who picked up an an­kle in­jury against Brighton last week, would be fit for the clash.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho, mean­while, has said he has al­ready moaned enough about the club’s packed fix­ture list and will not use it as an ex­cuse ahead of the clash to­day.</p>
    <p>Spurs thrashed Mac­cabi Haifa 7-2 on Thurs­day in a Europa League play-off game to reach the group stage as they coped with a third home game in five days, in­clud­ing last Sun­day’s New­cas­tle United draw and Tues­day’s League Cup shoot-out win over Chelsea.</p>
    <p>Eric Dier, Toby Alder­weireld and Steven Berg­wijn have all started twice in 48 hours this week, while Solskjaer fielded a much-changed line-up for Wed­nes­day’s League</p>
    <p>Cup vic­tory at Brighton.</p>
    <p>Yet Mour­inho is fo­cused only on prepar­ing Spurs, who con­firmed a sea­son-long loan deal for Brazil­ian striker Carlos Vini­cius from Ben­fica on Fri­day, to make one last push against his for­mer club.</p>
    <p>“It’s the last one, the last match,” he said. “I don’t want to moan. I moaned enough and I don’t think any­one dis­agreed with me, even when I was moan­ing about the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“But now (there) is only one more match, only the United match.</p>
    <p>“They (United) had only one match for the week and prob­a­bly the ma­jor­ity of the play­ers who</p>
    <p>POINT MADE</p>
    <p>played are not go­ing to play Sun­day. But I want to for­get that.”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho also said for­ward Son He­ung-min, the club’s top scorer in the league with four goals this sea­son, could play a part at Old Traf­ford after the South Korean re­cov­ered from a ham­string in­jury, which was not as bad as first feared.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to lie to you and say he doesn’t play and Sun­day he’s there,” he added.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, I don’t want to say he plays and then he doesn’t. So let’s wait and see.”</p>
    <p>I don’t want to moan. I moaned enough and I don’t think any­one dis­agreed with me, even when I was moan­ing about the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
