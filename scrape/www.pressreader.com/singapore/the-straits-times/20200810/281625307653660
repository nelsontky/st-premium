    <p>More than 8,000 fly­ing crew mem­bers have gone for skills train­ing in the past four months with the help of the air­lines and unions.</p>
    <p>The crew have been able to ac­cess vir­tual train­ing amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) has also been work­ing with the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Staff Union and Scoot Staff Union, which rep­re­sent crew, to help them find sec­ondary jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Hwee Liang, chair­man of NTUC’s Aero­space and Avi­a­tion (A&A) clus­ter, said: “Since the start of Covid-19, the NTUC A&A clus­ter to­gether with af­fil­i­ated unions... have been work­ing closely with man­age­ment part­ners in the key ar­eas of help­ing to mit­i­gate fly­ing crew’s in­come loss and se­cure their liveli­hoods, as well as in lever­ag­ing the down­time to up­skill and reskill the work­force.”</p>
    <p>He said SIA Group crew mem­bers have been tem­po­rar­ily placed with em­ploy­ers such as Fair Price, Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion and Gong Cha.</p>
    <p>He added that the A&A clus­ter has also worked with NTUC’s e2i (Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute) to help Jet­star Asia in its out­place­ment ef­forts and iden­ti­fy­ing sec­ondary job op­por­tu­ni­ties for its crew.</p>
    <p>About 850 crew mem­bers have tapped the NTUC Care Fund (Covid-19) that gives el­i­gi­ble union mem­bers a one-off re­lief of up to $300.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble crew mem­bers have also been di­rected to as­sis­tance schemes such as the Tem­po­rary Re­lief Fund.</p>
