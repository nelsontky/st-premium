    <p>Won­der­ing when, where and how the next pan­demic might strike?</p>
    <p>A Na­tional Ge­o­graphic doc­u­men­tary will dive into the work of Virus Hunters – the sci­en­tists and med­i­cal de­tec­tives rac­ing to study these mi­cro­scopic threats and avert an­other global dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>De­but­ing on Dec 3 at 9pm on Na­tional Ge­o­graphic (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 201 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 411) and stream­ing on Fox+, it sees epi­demi­ol­o­gist Christo­pher Golden and re­porter James Long­man meet­ing ex­perts in the United States, Liberia, Thai­land and Tur­key – all po­ten­tial hot zones – to fig­ure out the cul­tural, en­vi­ron­men­tal and disease pat­terns that trig­ger public health crises.</p>
    <p>Among those ex­perts are bat re­searcher Kendra Phelps and wildlife vet­eri­nar­ian Jim Des­mond.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press day, Dr Phelps spoke from a cave in south­ern Tur­key, where she and fel­low sci­en­tists are mon­i­tor­ing bat pop­u­la­tions, thought to be po­ten­tial car­ri­ers of viruses that might jump to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>There, they have found mul­ti­ple species of bats that are “co­ex­ist­ing quite closely with hu­mans” liv­ing nearby, she says.</p>
    <p>And by tak­ing bi­o­log­i­cal sam­ples from these crea­tures, the sci­en­tists hope to as­sess how viruses and pathogens might im­pact those hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Dr Phelps be­lieves it is pos­si­ble to con­trol the spread of zoonotic dis­eases – those that jump from an­i­mals to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>It is about “how we in­ter­act with the environmen­t and how we treat other species that co­ex­ist in the environmen­t with us”, she says.</p>
    <p>“By tak­ing care of the environmen­t and wildlife species and keep­ing those sep­a­rate from hu­man pop­u­la­tions, we can pre­vent the next spillover or trans­fer of bat viruses to hu­mans.”</p>
    <p>This is why it is a mis­take to blame bats for the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“One of the big­gest mis­con­cep­tions the public has is that it’s the bats’ fault or the fault of wildlife for trans­mit­ting a virus to hu­mans, and then peo­ple want to erad­i­cate those species.”</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, it is “hu­man en­croach­ment into wildlife habi­tats that is pro­vid­ing an op­por­tu­nity for hu­man-wildlife in­ter­ac­tions that would not nat­u­rally oc­cur”, she points out.</p>
    <p>An­other pan­demic-preven­tion tool – stop­ping the trade and con­sump­tion of ex­otic an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>In Liberia, for in­stance, chim­panzees are hunted as part of the roar­ing bush­meat trade in West Africa.</p>
    <p>Try­ing to bring a halt to this is a group Dr Des­mond founded, Liberia Chim­panzee Res­cue & Pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Part of our job is to help en­force wildlife pro­tec­tion laws and stop the killing of an­i­mals that end up go­ing into the value chain – one of the in­ter­faces where peo­ple can be­come ex­posed to po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous pathogens from the wildlife they catch and kill,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>This will not erad­i­cate the risk of zoonotic dis­eases, but it can sig­nif­i­cantly lower it.</p>
    <p>“What we’re all try­ing to do – what they’re do­ing in Tur­key or what we are do­ing here in Liberia – is mit­i­gate the risks,” Dr Des­mond says.</p>
    <p>“By chang­ing the hu­man be­hav­iour that cre­ates fur­ther risk of these pan­demics, we can bet­ter pro­tect the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, hu­mankind’s re­spon­si­bil­ity goes be­yond sim­ply not hunt­ing, eat­ing or com­ing in di­rect con­tact with cer­tain species.</p>
    <p>Dr Golden says that on a broader level, one must think “about the ways in which hu­mans are im­pact­ing nearly ev­ery ecosys­tem in the world – from de­for­esta­tion to sea-level rise to ur­ban­i­sa­tion and all of the path­ways in which the environmen­t is chang­ing”.</p>
    <p>These are hav­ing a dev­as­tat­ing im­pact not just on peo­ple, but also wildlife, and when wildlife are pres­sured to move and be­have in un­nat­u­ral ways, “it fur­ther cre­ates these op­por­tu­ni­ties for vi­ral trans­mis­sion to oc­cur”, he adds.</p>
    <p>The big­ger tool for pre­vent­ing an­other se­ri­ous pan­demic ul­ti­mately lies, there­fore, in “re­ally fo­cus­ing on con­ser­va­tion ef­forts – is­sues like wildlife trade and this in­creas­ing hu­man-and-wildlife in­ter­ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “This is how we can re­ally try to pre­vent the next pan­demic from oc­cur­ring.”</p>
    <p>• Virus Hunters de­buts on Dec 3 at 9pm on Na­tional Ge­o­graphic. In con­junc­tion with the de­but, Na­tional Ge­o­graphic will re­broad­cast two re­lated spe­cials, Break­through: Virus Fight­ers (to­day, 9pm) and Go­ing Vi­ral: From Ebola To Covid-19 (Dec 10, 9pm). All three ti­tles will air on Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 201 and StarHub TV Chan­nel 411 and stream on Fox+.</p>
    <p>MIS­TAKE TO BLAME BATS</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest mis­con­cep­tions the public has is that it’s the bats’ fault or the fault of wildlife for trans­mit­ting a virus to hu­mans, and then peo­ple want to erad­i­cate those species.</p>
