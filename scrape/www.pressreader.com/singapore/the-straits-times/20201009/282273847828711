    <p>• In­jury wor­ries clouded No­vak Djokovic’s hopes of a sec­ond French Open ti­tle as he said he had suf­fered neck and shoul­der prob­lems dur­ing his l aboured quar­ter-fi­nal win over Spain’s Pablo Car­reno Busta on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old top seed walked out onto a chilly Court Philippe Cha­trier with the back of his neck taped and he also needed treat­ment on his up­per arm dur­ing the match.</p>
    <p>It l ooked as though Car­reno Busta was primed to cause an up­set when he won the first set, but Djokovic sur­vived to win 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 and move into his 10th French Open semi-fi­nal to­day when he will play Greek fifth seed Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas.</p>
    <p>“I def­i­nitely didn’t feel great com­ing into the court to­day. Few things hap­pened in the warmup,” said the world No. 1, who looked con­strained, es­pe­cially on his trade­mark back­hand early on.</p>
    <p>“I had to deal with those phys­i­cal is­sues. As the match went on, I felt bet­ter, didn’t feel as much pain. Es­pe­cially for set and a half, he was the bet­ter player, dic­tat­ing the play.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t have much of en­ergy re­ally hap­pen­ing in my legs or move­ment or game it­self.”</p>
    <p>Asked ex­actly what the prob­lem was, he said: “I had some neck is­sues and some shoul­der is­sues. I don’t want to get re­ally too much into it. I’m still in the tour­na­ment, so I don’t want to re­veal too much.”</p>
    <p>It was Car­reno Busta who Djokovic was fac­ing in the fourth round of the US Open a month ago when he struck a fe­male line judge in the throat with a ball that he had swat­ted away in frus­tra­tion, end­ing in his dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard ac­cused Djokovic of games­man­ship on Wed­nes­day as he felt the Serb did not have any gen­uine health is­sues.</p>
    <p>“Each time he is in trou­ble, he usu­ally does it... ” Car­reno Busta said. “Ev­ery time a match gets com­pli­cated, he asks for med­i­cal as­sis­tance. He has been do­ing this for a long time.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic’s path to what he hopes will be an 18th Grand Slam ti­tle is now blocked by Tsit­si­pas, who will be dan­ger­ous, es­pe­cially if he is less than 100 per cent fit.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect a re­ally tough, tough match, tough chal­lenge for both of us,” the Serb said. “He’s a big guy, big serve. He has weapons, ob­vi­ously serve and fore­hand.</p>
    <p>“I’m hope­fully go­ing to be able to feel my best.”</p>
