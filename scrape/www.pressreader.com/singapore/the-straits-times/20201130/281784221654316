    <p>Cen­tral Java res­i­dent Tasri still re­mem­bers vividly the rum­bling, heat and flames spew­ing from Mount Mer­api, In­done­sia’s most ac­tive vol­cano dur­ing its last ma­jor erup­tion in 2010, which left more than 300 peo­ple dead and 20,000 oth­ers dis­placed.</p>
    <p>“I am now scared that the vol­cano will erupt again be­cause we don’t know how big it will be,” the 65-year-old mother of two told The Straits Times over the phone from the makeshift shel­ter at Tl­o­golele vil­lage, in Boy­olali re­gency, where some 280 res­i­dents have sought refuge since Nov 8.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has added to the wor­ries of those in the shel­ter, with each fam­ily al­lowed just 4 sq m of liv­ing space to en­sure they can keep a safe dis­tance from oth­ers. Mask wear­ing is also manda­tory.</p>
    <p>Although there is still risk of in­fec­tion at the shel­ter, Ms Tasri said she felt more com­fort­able there than at home.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s ge­o­log­i­cal agency raised Mer­api’s alert level to the sec­ond-high­est on Nov 5 due to in­creased ac­tiv­ity and warned of a new erup­tion that could send vol­canic ma­te­rial and hot ash clouds spew­ing as far as 5km.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, 2,157 peo­ple – mostly the el­derly, preg­nant women, chil­dren and those with dis­abil­i­ties – from four dis­tricts in Cen­tral Java and Yo­gyakarta have been evac­u­ated to shel­ters near their vil­lages.</p>
    <p>Around a quar­ter of a mil­lion peo­ple live within a 10km ra­dius of the 2,968m vol­cano, which sits amid sur­round­ing fer­tile soil – largely due to the ash from its erup­tions – highly suitable for farm­ing.</p>
    <p>In May 2018, the vol­cano spewed sand and py­ro­clas­tic ma­te­rial and sent ash as high as 5,500m into the sky when the peo­ple of Keningar vil­lage – which is the near­est to the moun­tain’s western slope in Mage­lang re­gency – were hold­ing a com­mu­nal event.</p>
    <p>It spread panic among the res­i­dents, many of whom, per­haps not sur­pris­ingly, have now opted for evac­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Keningar vil­lage chief Rohmat Sayidin said: “The res­i­dents were wor­ried and scared be­cause they were trau­ma­tised by the 2010 and 2018 erup­tions.”</p>
    <p>Min­ing, hik­ing and other ac­tiv­i­ties close to Mer­api have been halted.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Borobudur Con­ser­va­tion Agency cov­ered 56 open­work stu­pas at the famed and pop­u­lar tourist desti­na­tion, Borobudur Tem­ple, in Mage­lang, to pro­tect them. A sim­i­lar move was made on Thurs­day at the nearby Men­dut Tem­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Bam­bang Paw­i­tan, a res­i­dent of Paten vil­lage in Mage­lang, ar­rived at a shel­ter on Nov 6 with his par­ents, wife and 41/ 2- year-old son.</p>
    <p>He said he feels he is caught be­tween a rock and a hard place be­cause of Mer­api and Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I’m trau­ma­tised by the 2010 erup­tion,” said the 35-year-old, who had wit­nessed it up close.</p>
    <p>“If I hadn’t evac­u­ated, I wouldn’t be wor­ried about get­ting in­fected by Covid-19. But now I am in­creas­ingly wor­ried.”</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, In­done­sia has re­ported 534,266 Covid-19 in­fec­tions and 16,815 deaths – both the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Tl­o­golele vil­lage sec­re­tary Neigen Ach­tah Sa­pu­tra be­lieves vol­un­tary evac­u­a­tion was ap­pro­pri­ate for its res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>He said: “We don’t force our res­i­dents to evac­u­ate... but if they are aware of the dan­ger posed by Mer­api, they will stay (at the shel­ters).”</p>
    <p>Each day, the vil­lage emer­gency team pro­vides the evac­uees with ne­ces­si­ties and en­ter­tains them – es­pe­cially the el­derly – with cam­pur sari, a blend of Ja­vanese and mod­ern mu­sic, Mr Neigen added.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia said groups of vol­un­teers have also been vis­it­ing the shel­ters to help chil­dren with their stud­ies or with other ac­tiv­i­ties, such as games and sto­ry­telling.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the evac­u­a­tion process was car­ried out ac­cord­ing to health pro­to­cols to en­sure safety.</p>
    <p>“Ad­her­ence to health pro­to­cols is a must. Shel­ters pro­vide spa­ces to wash hands, and are also equipped with ther­mome­ter guns. Evac­uees must also wear masks,” said Mr Safrudin, an of­fi­cial at the Cen­tral Java dis­as­ter man­age­ment agency.</p>
    <p>In Mage­lang, for in­stance, evac­uees had to take Covid-19 rapid tests, and their health con­di­tion was as­sessed be­fore ad­mis­sion to the shel­ters, he added.</p>
    <p>At least three evac­uees in the re­gency have tested pos­i­tive and were sent to hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Evac­uees like Mr Bam­bang – who shut­tles daily be­tween the shel­ter and his house some 20km away to feed his three cat­tle – are wor­ried about their fu­ture, say­ing that they may need fur­ther gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance to re­store their liveli­hoods once they can re­turn home.</p>
    <p>“We are run­ning out of money. We spent cash to buy seeds to grow our plants, but then we left them to evac­u­ate and they are use­less now,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, the gov­ern­ment lends a hand so we can get back to farm­ing again.”</p>
