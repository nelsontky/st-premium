    <p>At l east 200 or­gan­i­sa­tions, i nclud­ing gov­ern­ment agen­cies and com­pa­nies around the world, have been hacked as part of a sus­pected Rus­sian cy­ber at­tack that i mplanted ma­li­cious code in a widely used soft­ware pro­gram, said a cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm and three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ac­tual hack­ing vic­tims has been one of many unan­swered ques­tions sur­round­ing the cy­ber at­tack, which used a back­door in So­larWinds’ Orion net­work man­age­ment soft­ware as a stag­ing ground for fur­ther at­tacks.</p>
    <p>As many as 18,000 So­larWinds cus­tomers re­ceived a ma­li­cious up­date that in­cluded the back­door, but the num­ber of them that were ac­tu­ally hacked – mean­ing the at­tack­ers used the back­door to in­fil­trate com­puter net­works – is likely to be far lower.</p>
    <p>Recorded Fu­ture, a cy­ber-se­cu­rity firm based in Mas­sachusetts, has iden­ti­fied 198 vic­tims that were hacked us­ing the So­larWinds back­door, said threat an­a­lyst Al­lan Liska.</p>
    <p>Three other peo­ple said the in­quiry so far has determined that the hack­ers fur­ther com­pro­mised at least 200 vic­tims, mov­ing within the com­puter net­works or at­tempt­ing to gain user cre­den­tials – what cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­perts call “hands on key­board” ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal num­ber could rise from there. Nei­ther Recorded Fu­ture nor the peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the in­quiry pro­vided the iden­ti­ties of the vic­tims.</p>
    <p>The num­ber is ex­pected to grow as the wide-rang­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­tin­ues. The hack­ers’ mo­tive re­mains un­known, and it is not clear what they re­viewed or stole from the com­puter net­works they in­fil­trated.</p>
    <p>Of the roughly 18,000 So­larWinds cus­tomers who re­ceived the in­fected up­date, more than 1,000 ex­pe­ri­enced the ma­li­cious code ping through a so-called sec­ond stage “com­mand and con­trol” server op­er­ated by hack­ers, giv­ing them the op­tion to hack fur­ther into the net­work, ac­cord­ing to pub­licly avail­able data and the three peo­ple. Com­mand and con­trol servers are used by hack­ers to man­age ma­li­cious code once it is in­side a tar­get net­work.</p>
    <p>More than 1,000 in­ves­ti­ga­tors have so far determined that at least 200 cus­tomers were fur­ther hacked. The next step would be for the hack­ers them­selves to in­fil­trate the com­puter net­work.</p>
    <p>A So­larWinds spokesman said the firm “re­mains fo­cused on col­lab­o­rat­ing with cus­tomers and ex­perts to share in­for­ma­tion and work to bet­ter un­der­stand this is­sue”.</p>
    <p>“It re­mains early days of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Hack­ers af­fil­i­ated with the Rus­sian gov­ern­ment have been sus­pected from the start, and United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo last Fri­day pro­vided con­fir­ma­tion in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“There was a sig­nif­i­cant ef­fort to use a piece of third-party soft­ware to es­sen­tially em­bed code in­side of US gov­ern­ment sys­tems and, it now ap­pears, sys­tems of pri­vate com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments across the world as well,” he said in a ra­dio in­ter­view. “This was a very sig­nif­i­cant ef­fort, and I think it’s the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Rus­sians that en­gaged in this ac­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, Se­nate In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee act­ing chair­man Marco Ru­bio said it was “in­creas­ingly clear that Rus­sian in­tel­li­gence con­ducted the gravest cy­ber in­tru­sion in our his­tory”.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has de­nied in­volve­ment. A top US cy­ber-se­cu­rity agency is­sued an alert last Thurs­day say­ing the hack­ers posed a “grave risk” to fed­eral, state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments, as well as crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture and the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The US Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency said the at­tack­ers were pa­tient, well re­sourced, and “demon­strated so­phis­ti­ca­tion and com­plex trade­craft”.</p>
    <p>It also said it had found ev­i­dence of other po­ten­tial back­doors be­sides the So­larWinds Orion plat­form, sug­gest­ing there could be en­tirely dif­fer­ent batches of po­ten­tial vic­tims who have not yet been iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft said last Thurs­day that 40 of its cus­tomers had been hacked, the at­tacks were on­go­ing, and the num­ber of vic­tims is ex­pected to in­crease.</p>
    <p>Among those hit were un­named cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pa­nies, gov­ern­ment agen­cies and gov­ern­ment con­trac­tors, roughly 80 per cent of which are in the US.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany FireEye was the first vic­tim to dis­close that it had been hacked, on Dec 8. It said that while in­ves­ti­gat­ing its own breach, re­searchers at the com­pany dis­cov­ered the So­larWinds back­door.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft said it found the ma­li­cious So­larWinds up­date within its net­work, but that it found no ev­i­dence of ac­cess to “pro­duc­tion ser­vices or cus­tomer data”.</p>
