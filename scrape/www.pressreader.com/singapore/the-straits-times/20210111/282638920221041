    <p>Amer­i­can hit­maker Benny Blanco is one of those rare song­writer-pro­duc­ers. He has his name cred­ited next to the singers’ in the hits he has cre­ated, for artistes like Justin Bieber, Ed Sheeran and Halsey.</p>
    <p>Blanco and Bieber’s lat­est col­lab­o­ra­tion, Lonely, was a global pop hit and in the Top 10 charts here in Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber, Blanco re­leased a song, Real S***, which he had done with rap­per Juice Wrld. The rap­per died in 2019 from an ac­ci­den­tal over­dose of painkiller­s.</p>
    <p>Here are five things to know about the 32-year-old, who has also pro­duced hits for pop artistes such as The Weeknd, Ari­ana Grande and Brit­ney Spears.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>JUSTIN BIEBER TRUSTS HIM</p>
    <p>Blanco has writ­ten songs with the Cana­dian pop star since 2009 and they have be­come close over the years.</p>
    <p>Their lat­est re­lease to­gether, Lonely, is a con­fes­sional song where Bieber sings about how find­ing fame at a young age has had a less than pos­i­tive ef­fect on him.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times over Zoom, Blanco says: “I’m not sure if we could have writ­ten that song if we didn’t have this re­la­tion­ship and we didn’t have this trust. I’ve been there from the highs to the lows, the mids.</p>
    <p>“When you’re writ­ing a song with some­one, you’re kind of like a ther­a­pist so you’re hav­ing to play many dif­fer­ent roles.”</p>
    <p>Bieber was re­luc­tant to re­lease the song at first, but Blanco con­vinced him to do it.</p>
    <p>“It’s like a breath of fresh air, a lot of artistes don’t talk about this stuff. And if one per­son goes, ‘Wow, Justin Bieber is go­ing through ev­ery­thing I’m go­ing through and you know he’s the big­gest artiste in the world, so I guess I can do it’, it’s a win.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>HE IS CLOSE TO ED SHEERAN</p>
    <p>Blanco fig­ures promi­nently in Song­writer, the 2018 film doc­u­men­tary on pop­u­lar Bri­tish singer­song­writer Sheeran. They are shown work­ing on songs to­gether when Sheeran was on a world­wide tour for his 2014 al­bum x.</p>
    <p>“He was bored, he was on tour for a year straight,” says Blanco, who de­scribes Sheeran as his “good friend”.</p>
    <p>“And I said, ‘Well, why don’t I come out on the road and we’ll make some songs?’ And then I came out and I never left.</p>
    <p>“It was like hav­ing a play­date with your friend ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>WORK­ING WITH ARTISTES IS LIKE A GYM SES­SION</p>
    <p>Blanco says the key to be­ing a good pro­ducer is not just by in­sert­ing enough of his own sound, but also by lis­ten­ing to the artiste and not let­ting him or her lose his or her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>“It’s like lift­ing weights. You know how there’s the guy who holds up the weight to make sure you don’t drop it?</p>
    <p>“It’s my job to be there and spot them when they need help and no­tice when they can do it them­selves,” he says.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>HANG­ING OUT IS PART OF THE JOB</p>
    <p>Blanco re­calls how he wrote Love Your­self, a 2015 No. 1 hit for Bieber, after par­ty­ing with hip-hop star Drake. “I had a night with Ed Sheeran. We stayed up re­ally late after a Drake party. We were so tired and hung over, and then we wrote Love Your­self.”</p>
    <p>He also fondly re­mem­bers work­ing with Amer­i­can singer Ke­sha.</p>
    <p>“I was with Ke­sha in New York City and we were writ­ing a song, and then she said, ‘Oh, can we take a break and go get tattoos?’</p>
    <p>“So we go and get tattoos and then come back,” he says.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>HE WANTS TO DO MORE THAN WRITE SONGS</p>
    <p>He be­lieves that song­writ­ers and pro­duc­ers can do more than work in the back­ground for other artistes.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore, when you give a song to some­one, then it’s over, you have no say in the mu­sic video, no say in the mar­ket­ing.”</p>
    <p>In 2018, he put out a solo al­bum,</p>
    <p>Friends Keep Se­crets, that pro­duced hits such as East­side, a song with Amer­i­can singers Halsey and Khalid.</p>
    <p>“For me, to be in­volved in all the cre­ative work and pick out the video, the mar­ket­ing and the way peo­ple are go­ing to see the tele­vi­sion per­for­mances has been so cool.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “So if peo­ple want to do that, then they should put their name on the songs and do it. It’s a lot more work and it’s re­ally hard. But it’s very grat­i­fy­ing to me.”</p>
