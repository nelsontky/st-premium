    <p>• The race to buy TikTok’s US op­er­a­tions has en­tered its fi­nal stages, with two groups sub­mit­ting bids for the Chi­nese video app, said three peo­ple in­volved in the deal talks.</p>
    <p>One of the bids was from Mi­crosoft and Wal­mart, which have teamed up, and the other was from Or­a­cle and could in­clude a coali­tion of in­vestors, they said.</p>
    <p>TikTok’s owner, Chi­nese In­ter­net com­pany ByteDance, will most likely make a de­ci­sion on the competing bids in the com­ing days, they said.</p>
    <p>A deal with Mi­crosoft and Wal­mart could draw on Wal­mart’s dig­i­tal sales back­ground to turn TikTok into a kind of e-com­merce app for both cre­ators and users, peo­ple in­volved in the talks said.</p>
    <p>A deal with Or­a­cle, the en­ter­prise soft­ware com­pany, would be more of a data play. Or­a­cle could use TikTok’s data about so­cial in­ter­ac­tions to ben­e­fit its cloud, data and ad­ver­tis­ing busi­nesses, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Wal­mart con­firmed it was par­tic­i­pat­ing in the dis­cus­sions and said: “We are con­fi­dent that a Wal­mart and Mi­crosoft part­ner­ship would meet both the ex­pec­ta­tions of US TikTok users while sat­is­fy­ing the con­cerns of US gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tors.”</p>
    <p>White House of­fi­cials, who have be­come in­creas­ingly tough on China, have said TikTok poses a na­tional se­cu­rity threat be­cause it could pro­vide data about US users to Bei­jing. This month, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der man­dat­ing that TikTok sell its US op­er­a­tions by mid-Septem­ber or cease trans­ac­tions within the coun­try.</p>
    <p>While TikTok has filed a lawsuit chal­leng­ing the or­der, it is also pre­par­ing for the pos­si­bil­ity that it will have to shut down if it has not reached a deal with an ac­quirer by the mid­dle of next month, sources said.</p>
    <p>Prices for a po­ten­tial deal have ranged from US$20 bil­lion (S$27.2 bil­lion) to US$50 bil­lion, peo­ple with knowl­edge of the talks have said.</p>
