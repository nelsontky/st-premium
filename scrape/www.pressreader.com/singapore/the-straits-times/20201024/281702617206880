    <p>•</p>
    <p>KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim has crit­i­cised re­ported plans by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to im­pose emer­gency mea­sures and fore­stall a par­lia­men­tary vote on the Bud­get sched­uled for next month.</p>
    <p>Sources told The Straits Times that Tan Sri Muhyid­din chaired a spe­cial Cabi­net meet­ing in Pu­tra­jaya yes­ter­day morn­ing to de­cide on emer­gency mea­sures to en­sure that the up­com­ing Bud­get ses­sion in Par­lia­ment does not re­sult in snap elec­tions if it fails to pass.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din holds a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, and fail­ure to pass the Bud­get would be tan­ta­mount to a no-con­fi­dence vote in his gov­ern­ment and could trig­ger snap polls.</p>
    <p>A gen­eral elec­tion, how­ever, amid a resur­gent wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, could prove dis­as­trous.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war, who re­cently claimed he has suf­fi­cient sup­port from a ma­jor­ity of the coun­try’s 222 law­mak­ers to form a new gov­ern­ment, said Mr Muhyid­din’s ad­min­is­tra­tion was us­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis as an ex­cuse to jus­tify its abuse of power.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has failed to pro­vide strong lead­er­ship in han­dling this cri­sis and is in­stead re­sort­ing to un­demo­cratic means to stay in power,” Mr An­war said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that an “eco­nomic emer­gency” could be pro­claimed to en­sure that gov­ern­ment spend­ing to curb</p>
    <p>Covid-19 – which has seen to­tal cases dou­bling this month alone – is not jeop­ar­dised by an in­creas­ingly un­sta­ble po­lit­i­cal at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din had an au­di­ence with Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, yes­ter­day evening and is be­lieved to have sought his as­sent to im­ple­ment th­ese emer­gency mea­sures. How­ever, as at yes­ter­day, there was no an­nounce­ment from the gov­ern­ment on the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war, who is pres­i­dent of Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat and heads the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion, said: “A state of emer­gency is de­clared when there is a threat to our na­tional se­cu­rity. But when the gov­ern­ment is it­self the source of that threat, then a state of emer­gency is noth­ing more than de­scent into dic­ta­tor­ship and au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism.”</p>
    <p>Other PH law­mak­ers also voiced their op­po­si­tion to the emer­gency mea­sures, say­ing there were suf­fi­cient laws in place to tackle the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. They ac­cused Mr Muhyid­din of us­ing the mea­sures to avoid hav­ing to prove his ma­jor­ity at the bal­lot box.</p>
    <p>For­mer health min­is­ter Dzulke­fly Ah­mad posted on Twit­ter that the coun­try needed a “strate­gic public health re­sponse”, not a “leg­isla­tive­po­lit­i­cal in­ter­ven­tion” to tackle the third wave of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Yeo Bee Yin, an MP from the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party, said that the Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol of In­fec­tious Diseases Act 1988 was suf­fi­cient to con­trol the pan­demic, and ques­tioned if the Prime Min­is­ter was us­ing an emer­gency to cling on to power.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war also crit­i­cised the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, de­scrib­ing it as “sheer in­com­pe­tence”.</p>
    <p>“While the rest of Asia is look­ing for ways to man­age the virus and re­open their economies safely, Malaysia is head­ing in the op­po­site di­rec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also slammed the gov­ern­ment for think­ing that “a re­ced­ing demo­cratic power is the best strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>“In fact, to over­come Covid-19, what we need is trans­parency, ac­count­abil­ity and firm ac­tion by the var­i­ous min­istries,” he said.</p>
    <p>UN­DEMO­CRATIC MOVE</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has failed to pro­vide strong lead­er­ship in han­dling this cri­sis and is in­stead re­sort­ing to un­demo­cratic means to stay in power.</p>
