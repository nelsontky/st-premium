    <p>As Sin­ga­pore heads into the new year with a record Bud­get deficit, the Gov­ern­ment will have to be pru­dent in spend­ing and make ev­ery dol­lar count, even as it saves jobs and keeps the econ­omy afloat.</p>
    <p>This was Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and Na­tional Devel­op­ment In­dra­nee Ra­jah’s as­sess­ment of the chal­lenges plan­ners face as they pre­pare next year’s Bud­get.</p>
    <p>This year, close to $100 bil­lion was ded­i­cated to Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures over four Bud­gets – draw­ing up to $52 bil­lion from the re­serves, and leav­ing a hole of around $74 bil­lion in the state cof­fers.</p>
    <p>But go­ing for­ward, the fo­cus must now be on how to emerge stronger from Covid-19 de­spite lim­ited re­sources, said Ms In­dra­nee.</p>
    <p>She said the Gov­ern­ment’s top pri­or­ity is to exit the cri­sis and keep ev­ery­one safe and healthy.</p>
    <p>But she noted that the fis­cal road ahead will be a tough one.</p>
    <p>“In pre­vi­ous years when we might have had Bud­get sur­pluses, you could think in terms of good­ies.</p>
    <p>“But next year... it’s more in terms of: ‘With the re­sources that we have, how do we use them in the most care­ful and pru­dent way such that we get the most out of lim­ited re­sources?’”</p>
    <p>She was ad­dress­ing 150 Sin­ga­pore­ans at a vir­tual Sin­ga­pore To­gether Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tion (ESC) last night, to seek their views and sug­ges­tions on next year’s Bud­get.</p>
    <p>The two-hour ses­sion, or­gan­ised by gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach and the Min­istry of Fi­nance, was co-hosted by Mr Tan Kiat How, Reach chair­man and Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants dis­cussed how to man­age the trade-off be­tween strength­en­ing the econ­omy while keep­ing the pub­lic safe; and how to en­cour­age so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and en­sure greater dig­i­tal in­clu­sion, among other is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee told re­porters a bal­anced Bud­get next year will be “quite hard” – echo­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s re­marks last month that there is un­likely to be a Bud­get sur­plus next year, given the on­go­ing eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>She said the Gov­ern­ment will have to be pru­dent, spend where nec­es­sary, and en­sure good re­turns on the money that is put in. “We have to make ev­ery dol­lar count and stretch the dol­lar.”</p>
    <p>She added that while cost man­age­ment is im­por­tant, one must also look at the growth side of the equa­tion and find rev­enue which comes from that growth.</p>
    <p>“Growth will only come when you have the eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, and at the same time, we have got to bal­ance this with the health and safety part of it,” Ms In­dra­nee said.</p>
    <p>This is why the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force was formed to chart strate­gies for Sin­ga­pore’s post-pan­demic re­cov­ery, she said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the task force are seven Al­liances for Ac­tion – in­dus­tryled coali­tions tasked to de­vise ideas and gen­er­ate jobs in ar­eas such as sus­tain­abil­ity, ro­bot­ics and ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Some growth ar­eas Ms In­dra­nee ob­served are lo­gis­tics, merg­ers and acquisitio­ns, and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat met busi­ness lead­ers to dis­cuss how the Gov­ern­ment can part­ner busi­nesses to emerge stronger.</p>
    <p>He said in a Face­book post that there will be more pre-Bud­get con­ver­sa­tions in the com­ing weeks, and urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to share their ideas. “Ev­ery­one can play a role... The Bud­get re­flects our col­lec­tive needs and as­pi­ra­tions as a so­ci­ety, and charts our di­rec­tion as a na­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>More than 2,850 Sin­ga­pore­ans have par­tic­i­pated in over 45 Sin­ga­pore To­gether ESC ses­sions since the start of the series in June.</p>
