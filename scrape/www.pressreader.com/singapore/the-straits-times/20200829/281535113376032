    <p>The Tour de France be­gins today at the Prom­e­nade des Anglais with­out fans, amid the pan­demic. The race start in Nice is a Covid-19 “red zone” as the num­ber of daily in­fec­tions in France reached a post-lock­down high. Or­gan­is­ers have im­ple­mented pro­to­col stat­ing that two pos­i­tive cases in any team will see them re­moved from the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>• The Tour de France rolls out of the French Riviera today with peaks, plains and rigid coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols stand­ing be­tween the 176 riders and the fi­nal dash along the Champs-El­y­sees in Paris.</p>
    <p>Race chief Chris­tian Prud­homme likes to say the Tour is “3,000km of smiles”, but he has ap­pealed for the ex­pected 10 mil­lion road­side fans to mask up this year.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tors, how­ever, will not be at the Prom­e­nade des Anglais race start today af­ter the Alpes-Mar­itimes re­gion, which Nice is a part of, was re­clas­si­fied as a Covid-19 “red zone”, along with 18 other French de­part­ments due to a resur­gence in cases across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily in­fec­tions in France reached a post-lock­down high of 6,111 on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>As such, the en­hanced safety mea­sures will also ap­ply to stage 2, with no camper vans or pop-up vil­lages al­lowed, ac­cord­ing to re­gional pre­fect Bernard Gon­za­lez.</p>
    <p>Con­firm­ing only 100 at­ten­dees, com­pris­ing mu­nic­i­pal­ity staff “who worked so hard to get this to hap­pen”, will be at the flag-off, he said: “We’re shift­ing from tight to very tight con­di­tions. Peo­ple should stay home and watch on TV.”</p>
    <p>To en­sure the safety of the par­tic­i­pants, race or­gan­is­ers ASO have im­ple­mented an 18-page pro­to­col list that states two pos­i­tive Covid-19 cases in any team will see them re­moved from the blue-riband event, al­though sources told Reuters that rule “is ex­pected to be re­laxed”.</p>
    <p>All in­volved have al­ready un­der­gone two poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) nasal tests in the buildup and there will be con­sis­tent test­ing car­ried out. The stricter reg­u­la­tions have im­pacted Lotto Soudal, with four mem­bers of the Bel­gian team ejected from the race on Thurs­day af­ter a me­chanic and a care­taker tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Race favourites Ineos Gre­nadiers, whose pre­vi­ous it­er­a­tion Team Sky have won seven of the last eight edi­tions of the Tour, be­lieve or­gan­is­ers have done ev­ery­thing in their power to re­duce the risk of con­tract­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>While team prin­ci­pal Dave Brails­ford yes­ter­day ad­mit­ted “no­body knows if we’re go­ing to reach (fi­nal stage) Paris”, he said: “They re­ally have done ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to make the event work.”</p>
    <p>On the pos­si­bil­ity of a false pos­i­tive de­rail­ing a team’s chances – an is­sue that Ger­many’s Bora–Hans­grohe raised at the Bre­tagne Clas­sic ear­lier this week – the Bri­ton added it was “not the best sce­nario” but a risk every­one had to take.</p>
    <p>Egan Ber­nal will de­fend his ti­tle as sole cap­tain of Ineos, who axed both four-time win­ner Chris Froome and 2018 cham­pion Geraint Thomas from their ros­ter last week.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he will not go into the three-week race as the favourite. The Colom­bian yes­ter­day re­vealed he was still ham­pered by back pain, which prompted his with­drawal from the Cri­terium du Dauphine ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Slove­nian Pri­moz Roglic will be his main ri­val, hav­ing won l ast year’s Vuelta a Es­pana and the re­cent Tour de l’Ain.</p>
    <p>De­spite a heavy fall that cost him the Cri­terium race – he was lead­ing but had to pull out of the last stage – the Jumbo-Visma leader said he has fully re­cov­ered and is ready to go.</p>
    <p>His team­mate and 2017 Giro d’Italia win­ner, Tom Du­moulin, will also give the Dutch team a twopronged as­sault on the gen­eral clas­si­fi­ca­tion, mak­ing them the big­gest threat to Ineos.</p>
    <p>Brails­ford in­sisted his team’s pedi­gree means they can­not be counted out, say­ing: “I’m very ex­cited about this young team with an ex­pe­ri­enced sup­port cast. Egan de­serves</p>
    <p>UN­CHARTED TER­RI­TORY</p>
    <p>No­body knows if we’re go­ing to reach Paris (the fi­nal stage). ’’</p>
    <p>DAVE BRAILS­FORD, race favourites Ineos Gre­nadiers’ team prin­ci­pal, on the un­cer­tainty of this year’s Tour de France.</p>
    <p>the lead­er­ship. He’s a bril­liant rider, a huge tal­ent.”</p>
    <p>Twenty-two teams, in­clud­ing debu­tants Is­rael Start-Up Na­tion, will ply the route, which re­sem­bles last year’s itin­er­ary and crosses all five of France’s moun­tain ranges.</p>
    <p>There will be five sum­mit fin­ishes and 29 clas­si­fied moun­tain climbs, with the French plains likely to be whipped by au­tumn winds, es­pe­cially on runs along the coast such as stage 10 be­tween the At­lantic is­lands of Oleron and Re.</p>
    <p>In a Tour like no other, it will be a vic­tory in it­self whether it is Ber­nal, Roglic or an­other who pulls on the yel­low jer­sey in Paris on Sept 20.</p>
