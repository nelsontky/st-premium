    <p>NEW YORK • Keith Raniere, the founder of the cult-like group NXIVM where women were kept on star­va­tion di­ets, branded with his ini­tials and or­dered to have sex with him, was sen­tenced on Tues­day to 120 years in pri­son fol­low­ing his con­vic­tion for sex traf­fick­ing and other crimes.</p>
    <p>The sen­tence was im­posed by US District Judge Ni­cholas Ga­rau­fis in Brook­lyn, af­ter a hear­ing where 15 for­mer NXIVM mem­bers spoke out against Raniere, 60.</p>
    <p>Mr Ga­rau­fis said “no words can ad­e­quately ex­press the last­ing pain” Raniere caused his vic­tims.</p>
    <p>He also fined Raniere US$1.75 mil­lion (S$2.39 mil­lion), the max­i­mum al­lowed by the law.</p>
    <p>“I do be­lieve strongly that I’m in­no­cent of these crimes,” Raniere said be­fore be­ing sen­tenced.</p>
    <p>He said some of the vic­tims’ state­ments were false, but that he was “truly sorry” for caus­ing them pain.</p>
    <p>“It is our sin­cere hope that today’s sen­tence does de­liver some mea­sure of j us­tice to those vic­tims,” act­ing United States At­tor­ney Seth DuCharme, whose of­fice pros­e­cuted the case, said af­ter the sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>“Keith Raniere will not be able to vic­timise peo­ple any more.”</p>
    <p>Fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors had sought a life sen­tence for Raniere for crimes he com­mit­ted as the leader of NXIVM, a pur­ported self-help group based near Al­bany, New York. They ac­cused Raniere of a “to­tal de­nial of cul­pa­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing post-con­vic­tion calls and e-mails, the pros­e­cu­tion said Raniere pre­sented his or­gan­i­sa­tion as a “good” thing, won­der­ing “who will carry forth this burn­ing torch of light?”</p>
    <p>Mr Marc Ag­nifilo, Raniere’s at­tor­ney, asked for just 20 years, say­ing his client did not mean to hurt any­one.</p>
    <p>Mr Ag­nifilo said the sen­tence should take into ac­count Raniere’s “per­spec­tive”, drawing a sharp re­buke from Mr Ga­rau­fis.</p>
    <p>“We’re not sen­tenc­ing him based on a per­spec­tive,” the judge said. “We’re sen­tenc­ing him based on his be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>NXIVM – pro­nounced Nex­ium – proved a huge draw with its prom­ise of self-im­prove­ment cour­ses af­ter Raniere founded the or­gan­i­sa­tion in New York state in 1998.</p>
    <p>But Raniere, who was ar­rested in Mex­ico in 2018, swopped the per­sonal devel­op­ment train­ing cour­ses for sex ses­sions as the head of a sub­group of up to 20 women – the youngest of whom was a 15-yearold.</p>
    <p>The vic­tims, most of whom were women, de­scribed what they called Raniere’s dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on their lives.</p>
    <p>The first speaker, iden­ti­fied in court only as Camila, re­counted a 12-year sex­ual re­la­tion­ship with Raniere start­ing when she was 15 and he was 45.</p>
    <p>“He screwed with my mind for so long that try­ing to find the strength and clar­ity to tell my story has been a slow and painful jour­ney,” Camila said.</p>
    <p>Her sis­ter Daniela, who tes­ti­fied at the trial about her own abu­sive re­la­tion­ship with Raniere, called him “pa­thetic” and said he “de­serves no mercy”.</p>
    <p>Their brother Adrian and mother Adri­ana, who were also part of NXIVM, lamented how the fa­ther and old­est sis­ter re­mained loyal to Raniere.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore be­ing part of NXIVM, my fam­ily was close,” Adrian said. “He de­stroyed my fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Another for­mer mem­ber, ac­tress India Ox­en­berg, told Raniere at the hear­ing: “You stole seven years of my life that I’ll never get back.”</p>
    <p>Ju­rors con­victed Raniere in June last year of rack­e­teer­ing con­spir­acy, sex traf­fick­ing and pos­ses­sion of child pornog­ra­phy in the form of pho­tos of 15-year-old Camila, among other crimes, fol­low­ing ex­ten­sive tes­ti­mony from for­mer NXIVM mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said Raniere es­tab­lished a fac­tion within the group called DOS, a pyra­mid struc­ture in which the women were “slaves” and “Grand Mas­ter” Raniere sat at the top.</p>
    <p>The “slaves” were made to have sex with Raniere, hand over per­sonal in­for­ma­tion and com­pro­mis­ing pho­tos – and some of the women were branded like cat­tle as other mem­bers held them down.</p>
    <p>The dra­matic story has been the sub­ject of two screen adap­tions: HBO’s re­cently re­leased The Vow docu-se­ries and Es­cap­ing The NXIVM Cult, a 2019 film fo­cused on the tes­ti­mony of a mother work­ing to save her daugh­ter from the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>More than 50 peo­ple wrote let­ters to Mr Ga­rau­fis urg­ing le­niency for Raniere, in­clud­ing the fa­ther of</p>
    <p>Camila and Daniela, Hec­tor.</p>
    <p>Many said that the NXIVM classes, which could cost thou­sands of dol­lars, had greatly im­proved their lives.</p>
    <p>“I find Hec­tor’s let­ter in sup­port of the man who abused his own daugh­ters a dis­grace,” Mr Ga­rau­fis said.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Raniere’s con­vic­tion, New York pros­e­cu­tor Richard Donoghue said the pro­ceed­ings “re­vealed that Raniere, who por­trayed him­self as a sa­vant and a ge­nius, was in fact, a mas­ter ma­nip­u­la­tor, a con­man and the crime boss of a cult-like or­gan­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other peo­ple af­fil­i­ated with NXIVM have pleaded guilty to crim­i­nal charges.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded Sea­gram liquor heiress Clare Bronf­man, ac­tress Al­li­son Mack, for­mer NXIVM pres­i­dent Nancy Salz­man and her daugh­ter Lau­ren Salz­man, who be­came a star pros­e­cu­tion wit­ness.</p>
    <p>Bronf­man was ac­cused of help­ing bankroll NXIVM, and was sen­tenced last month to more than six years in pri­son.</p>
    <p>Be­fore be­ing part of NXIVM, my fam­ily was close. He de­stroyed my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>ADRIAN, brother of a woman who tes­ti­fied at the trial about her 12-year abu­sive re­la­tion­ship with NXIVM cult leader Keith Raniere.</p>
    <p>You stole seven years of my life that I’ll never get back. AC­TRESS INDIA OX­EN­BERG, on the im­pact of Raniere’s ac­tions.</p>
