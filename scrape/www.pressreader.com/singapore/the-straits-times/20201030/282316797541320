    <p>Peo­ple plan­ning to get their flu shots are urged to call clin­ics in ad­vance to check if the vac­cines are avail­able.</p>
    <p>The ad­vice was given by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day as the pool of in­fluenza vac­cines for the win­ter flu sea­son has shrunk, af­ter Sin­ga­pore halted the use of the SKYCellflu Quadri­va­lent and Vax­i­gripTe­tra vac­cines on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The MOH and the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity took the pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure fol­low­ing the death of at least 48 peo­ple in South Korea who re­ceived ei­ther of the two vac­cines, or five other flu vac­cines not avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) has also halted tem­po­rar­ily its an­nual in­fluenza vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise for Min­def and Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) per­son­nel. The ex­er­cise has been run­ning for about five years.</p>
    <p>Chief of Med­i­cal Corps, Colonel (Dr) Ed­ward Lo, told The Straits Times it is a pre­cau­tion­ary move.</p>
    <p>“Min­def and the SAF will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the evolv­ing sit­u­a­tion and im­ple­ment the nec­es­sary mea­sures in line with na­tional guide­lines.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that SingHealth has done the same. Since Sun­day, all its in­sti­tu­tions have tem­po­rar­ily stopped giv­ing flu shots to their staff. The two named vac­cines had been used in the in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the steps taken, Sin­ga­pore is left with mainly two other in­fluenza vac­cines: Flu­arix Tetra, sup­plied by Glax­o­smithk­line, and In­flu­vac Tetra, sup­plied by Ab­bott Lab­o­ra­to­ries (Sin­ga­pore). Both were brought into Sin­ga­pore for the north­ern hemi­sphere 2020-2021 in­fluenza sea­son.</p>
    <p>MOH told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “These in­fluenza vac­cine prod­ucts are avail­able, but as med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers gen­er­ally stock only one type of in­fluenza vac­cine, per­sons are ad­vised to call in ad­vance to check that the in­fluenza vac­cine is avail­able in the clinic.”</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that it is mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion, in­clud­ing the take-up of the flu vac­ci­na­tions and the sup­ply of vac­cines in the mar­ket. It is also in touch with sup­pli­ers of the unaf­fected vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate hos­pi­tals and gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers in­ter­viewed said they are now us­ing Flu­arix Tetra or</p>
    <p>In­flu­vac Tetra.</p>
    <p>From Sun­day, sub­si­dies for vac­ci­na­tions rec­om­mended un­der the Na­tional Child­hood Im­mu­ni­sa­tion Sched­ule and Na­tional Adult Im­mu­ni­sa­tion Sched­ule – both in­clude in­fluenza vac­cines – will be raised.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, el­i­gi­ble peo­ple un­der the age of 18 will now re­ceive free vac­ci­na­tions for dis­eases such as in­fluenza and chick­en­pox.</p>
    <p>The new sub­si­dies will be ap­pli­ca­ble at Com­mu­nity Health As­sist Scheme gen­eral prac­ti­tioner (GP) clin­ics and poly­clin­ics.</p>
    <p>GPs said the higher sub­si­dies could drive up de­mand for the flu vac­cines, but it may not be too high since fewer will be go­ing abroad.</p>
    <p>Dr Quah Soon Wee, fam­ily physi­cian at Cross­roads Fam­ily Clinic, said: “Peo­ple used to get their flu vac­cines be­fore they go for their De­cem­ber hol­i­days, es­pe­cially to tem­per­ate coun­tries. But with the marked de­crease in over­seas travel, the de­mand for flu vac­cine will not be that high.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported early this month that the de­mand for flu vac­cines has risen in the past few months as the win­ter flu sea­son ap­proaches, to pre­vent a “twindemic” of Covid-19 and in­fluenza.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, the num­ber of flu cases has re­mained low, with poly­clin­ics see­ing fewer than half the num­ber of pa­tients seek­ing treat­ment for acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal di­rec­tor of North­east Med­i­cal Group, Dr Tan Teck Jack, said that in the un­likely sce­nario of a vac­cine short­age, “we will likely take a risk-based ap­proach and pri­ori­tise our pa­tients ac­cord­ing to their health needs, age and pres­ence of chronic dis­eases”.</p>
