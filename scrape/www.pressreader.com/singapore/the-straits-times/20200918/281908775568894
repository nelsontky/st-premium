    <p>SEOUL •</p>
    <p>A year ago, Mr Moon Jaein’s pres­i­dency was shaken by al­le­ga­tions that a high-fly­ing jus­tice min­is­ter had abused his in­flu­ence to ben­e­fit his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Now, the South Korean Pres­i­dent is in a sim­i­lar jam, with a dif­fer­ent jus­tice min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors raided the Min­istry of Na­tional De­fence and Army Head­quar­ters on Tues­day as part of a probe into whether Jus­tice Min­is­ter Choo Mi-ae i nap­pro­pri­ately helped her son ex­tend his med­i­cal leave from mil­i­tary ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The scan­dal has quickly con­sumed lo­cal pol­i­tics, with op­po­si­tion lawmakers grilling Ms Choo in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The case has drawn par­al­lels with a con­tro­versy last year that forced Mr Moon’s pre­vi­ous jus­tice min­is­ter, Cho Kuk, to re­sign – driv­ing the gov­ern­ment’s ap­proval rat­ing to an all-time low. Cho, a for­mer top aide to Mr Moon, is cur­rently on trial on charges in­clud­ing bribery and ob­struc­tion of jus­tice, af­ter a scan­dal in­volv­ing fam­ily in­vest­ment and univer­sity ad­mis­sions for his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Mr Moon man­aged to stage a po­lit­i­cal come­back due to his suc­cess­ful ef­forts to con­tain the coron­avirus out­break, and in April se­cured an un­prece­dented su­per­ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment for his pro­gres­sive Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>The scan­dals have reignited anger over in­equal­ity, which fu­elled the down­fall of Mr Moon’s pre­de­ces­sor Park Geun-hye in 2016 and pro­pelled Mr Moon to power, with his prom­ise to build a “world with­out priv­i­lege”.</p>
    <p>The con­ser­va­tive op­po­si­tion, which this month adopted the more pop­ulist-sound­ing name Peo­ple’s Power, is at­tempt­ing to har­ness that dis­sat­is­fac­tion to carry it back to the pres­i­dency when Mr Moon’s sin­gle, five-year term ex­pires in 2022.</p>
    <p>The bat­tle played out in the Na­tional Assem­bly on Mon­day as op­po­si­tion lawmakers pressed Ms Choo for de­tails about whether she or her hus­band in 2017 used her sta­tus as Demo­cratic Party chair­man to get their son’s med­i­cal leave ex­tended.</p>
    <p>“It’s a uni­lat­eral, one-sided claim and a com­plete mis­un­der­stand­ing,” Ms Choo told lawmakers on Mon­day, re­ject­ing al­le­ga­tions of any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>While she denied per­son­ally con­tact­ing the mil­i­tary on her son’s be­half, she de­clined to say whether an aide had done so.</p>
    <p>The next day, the DongA Ilbo news­pa­per re­ported, with­out say­ing where it got the in­for­ma­tion, that a for­mer Choo aide told pros­e­cu­tors that he had con­tacted the mil­i­tary about her son’s case.</p>
    <p>Ms Choo said in ques­tion­ing by op­po­si­tion lawmakers in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that she was aware that her aide had con­tacted the mil­i­tary through re­ports in the me­dia, deny­ing she had first-hand knowledge of it.</p>
    <p>She added that nei­ther she nor her hus­band had con­tacted the mil­i­tary. BLOOMBERG</p>
