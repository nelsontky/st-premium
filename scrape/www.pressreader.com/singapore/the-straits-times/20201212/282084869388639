    <p>South Africa and In­dia have pe­ti­tioned the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion to sus­pend some in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tions for Covid-19 drugs, vac­cines and di­ag­nos­tic tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>In sup­port of the ef­fort, Doctors With­out Bor­ders be­gan a so­cial me­dia cam­paign urg­ing gov­ern­ments to “put lives over prof­its”, warn­ing of “pharma prof­i­teer­ing” and urg­ing sup­port for “#NoCovidMo­nop­o­lies”.</p>
    <p>The ac­tivists lob­by­ing to end Covid-19 patents do so out of a le­git­i­mate con­cern. Now that we have tools to end the pan­demic, what if they aren’t dis­trib­uted fairly? My col­leagues in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try share this worry. Global in­equal­ity will only worsen if rich na­tions vac­ci­nate them­selves and leave the rest of the world to fend for it­self.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how sus­pend­ing patent pro­tec­tions would en­sure fair dis­tri­bu­tion. But what is clear is that if suc­cess­ful, the ef­fort would jeop­ar­dise fu­ture med­i­cal in­no­va­tion, mak­ing us more vul­ner­a­ble to other dis­eases.</p>
    <p>In­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights, in­clud­ing patents, grant in­ven­tors a pe­riod of ex­clu­siv­ity to make and mar­ket their cre­ations. By af­ford­ing th­ese rights to those who cre­ate in­tan­gi­ble as­sets, such as mu­si­cal com­po­si­tions, soft­ware or drug for­mu­las – peo­ple will in­vent more use­ful new things.</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ment of a new medicine is risky and costly. Con­sider that sci­en­tists have spent decades – and bil­lions of dol­lars – work­ing on Alzheimer’s treat­ments, but still have lit­tle to show for it. The com­pa­nies and in­vestors who fund re­search shoul­der so much risk be­cause they have a shot at a re­ward. Once a patent ex­pires, generic com­pa­nies are free to pro­duce the same prod­uct.</p>
    <p>In­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights un­der­pin the sys­tem that gives us all new medicines – from psy­chi­atric drugs to can­cer treat­ments.</p>
    <p>In try­ing to de­fend th­ese rights, the drug in­dus­try has made mis­takes in the past that have lost peo­ple’s trust. More than 22 years ago, for ex­am­ple, a group of drug com­pa­nies sued the South African gov­ern­ment for try­ing to im­port cheaper anti-Aids drugs amid an epi­demic. With price stand­ing be­tween pa­tients and sur­vival, the suit, which the com­pa­nies even­tu­ally dropped, was a ter­ri­ble mis­judg­ment.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is not a par­al­lel. Sev­eral ma­jor drug com­pa­nies – in­clud­ing As­traZeneca, Glax­oSmithK­line and John­son & John­son – have pledged to of­fer their vac­cines on a not-for-profit ba­sis dur­ing the pan­demic. Oth­ers are con­sid­er­ing dif­fer­en­tial pric­ing for dif­fer­ent coun­tries.</p>
    <p>As of last month, four ma­jor phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies had al­ready agreed to even­tu­ally pro­duce at least three bil­lion vac­cine doses for low- and mid­dle-in­come na­tions, ac­cord­ing to one anal­y­sis. In South Africa and In­dia, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies are al­ready work­ing with lo­cal part­ners to make their vac­cines avail­able.</p>
    <p>John­son & John­son has en­tered into a tech­nol­ogy trans­fer part­ner­ship for i ts can­di­date vac­cine with South Africa’s Aspen Phar­ma­care, and As­traZeneca has reached a li­cens­ing deal with the Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia to de­velop up to one bil­lion doses of its vac­cine for low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can af­ford to li­cense patents for free, or sell drugs at cost, pre­cisely be­cause they know that their in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty will be pro­tected. That’s not a flaw in the sys­tem; it’s how the sys­tem en­sures that phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal re­search will con­tinue to be funded.</p>
    <p>Erod­ing patent pro­tec­tions has far-reach­ing con­se­quences. Take “mes­sen­ger RNA”, the tech­nol­ogy plat­form that sup­ports the vac­cines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Doctors Ozlem Tureci and Ugur Sahin, the wife-and-hus­band team at the helm of BioNTech, be­gan ex­plor­ing the use of mRNA more than 25 years ago and founded their com­pany in 2008.</p>
    <p>The­o­ret­i­cally, mRNA can in­struct the body to en­gi­neer pro­teins, in­clud­ing ones that in­crease im­mu­nity against in­fec­tious pathogens, can­cers and rare ge­netic con­di­tions. But the Covid-19 vac­cines are the first truly suc­cess­ful ap­pli­ca­tions of this tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists ea­ger to ex­plore fu­ture uses of mRNA will strug­gle to find in­vest­ment if in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tions are snatched away when oth­ers deem it nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights cite pub­lic in­vest­ment in re­search as a rea­son to waive patent pro­tec­tions. They cor­rectly point out that gov­ern­ments bankroll im­por­tant, early-stage re­search across the sciences.</p>
    <p>It’s true that with­out pub­lic funds from agencies such as the US Bio­med­i­cal Ad­vanced Re­search and Devel­op­ment Author­ity or the Ger­man Fed­eral Ministry of Ed­u­ca­tion and Re­search, global drug com­pa­nies might not have de­vel­oped Covid-19 vac­cines so quickly.</p>
    <p>But here, the fund­ing prin­ci­pally helped re­duce risk and ac­cel­er­ate pro­duc­tion time­lines – the re­search and devel­op­ment it­self was still driven by sci­en­tists in the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, gov­ern­ments have nei­ther the money nor the risk tol­er­ance to take over the role of busi­nesses in de­vel­op­ing phar­macy-ready medicines. There is no avail­able sub­sti­tute for pri­vate fund­ing in bring­ing new medicines to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Di­rect­ing gov­ern­ment labs to man­u­fac­ture medicines, for ex­am­ple, would politi­cise drug devel­op­ment, em­pow­er­ing politi­cians and their ap­pointees to de­cide which re­search lines were worth fund­ing.</p>
    <p>There is also no rea­son to fear a Covid-19 vac­cine mo­nop­oly. Ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, there are 214 Covid-19 vac­cine projects around the world; 52 are in clin­i­cal tri­als, with 13 in the most ad­vanced phase of test­ing. Seven have been ap­proved for emer­gency or lim­ited use in var­i­ous coun­tries. In short, we are rapidly headed for a com­pet­i­tive mar­ket­place, the op­po­site of a mo­nop­oly.</p>
    <p>There are, to be sure, se­ri­ous ob­sta­cles to dis­tribut­ing Covid-19 vac­cines quickly and fairly around the world. But they have noth­ing to do with in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge, rather, is speedy man­u­fac­tur­ing. A US De­fence De­part­ment study es­ti­mated that it would cost US$1.56 bil­lion (S$2.1 bil­lion) over 25 years to build and op­er­ate a fa­cil­ity pro­duc­ing three vac­cines. Fa­cil­i­ties cost less in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries like In­dia, but only marginally. The equip­ment re­quired to pro­duce vac­cines – biore­ac­tors, cen­trifuges, cold stor­age and the like – is ex­pen­sive ev­ery­where. That’s why Covid-19 vac­cine pro­duc­tion is tak­ing place al­most ex­clu­sively in ex­ist­ing fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dis­man­tling patent pro­tec­tion would do noth­ing to ex­pand ac­cess to vac­cines or to boost global man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity. Re­search sci­en­tists de­velop vac­cines in record time be­cause they have the se­cu­rity and re­sources that come with a ro­bust sys­tem of pro­tec­tion for their in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty.</p>
    <p>That sys­tem is cru­cial to al­low­ing com­pa­nies to cre­ate the vac­cines we need for wide dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
