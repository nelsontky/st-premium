    <p>Mr Boris John­son’s big­gest prob­lem is that he is not per­ceived as a man of de­tail at a time when de­tails about the state of the Bri­tish health ser­vice and the econ­omy mat­ter most.</p>
    <p>Ac­cused of mis­han­dling his gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has sought to re­gain the ini­tia­tive by vow­ing to trans­form his coun­try’s econ­omy, boost its ed­u­ca­tional stan­dards and ex­pand the avail­abil­ity of newly-built homes in or­der to ad­dress ris­ing house prices.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been through too much frus­tra­tion and hard­ship just to set­tle for the sta­tus quo and to think that life can go on as it was be­fore the plague,” he told his rul­ing Con­ser­va­tive Party’s an­nual con­fer­ence on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>But his con­fer­ence speech, which tra­di­tion­ally at­tracts con­sid­er­able me­dia at­ten­tion, failed to stir much de­bate this year, mainly be­cause the party’s gath­er­ing was held vir­tu­ally, through elec­tronic plat­forms, ow­ing to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>More omi­nously still for Mr John­son, opinion polls in­di­cate that the op­po­si­tion Labour Party has over­taken the gov­ern­ment in the pop­u­lar­ity stakes, less than a year af­ter the Con­ser­va­tives won a re­sound­ing vic­tory in the gen­eral elec­tions.</p>
    <p>So, Mr John­son will need more than one speech to re­verse the cur­rent neg­a­tive trends.</p>
    <p>Cir­cum­stances have not been easy for most Euro­pean lead­ers; it is dif­fi­cult to sound up­beat or de­ci­sive when cur­rent tasks con­sist mostly of lock­ing down economies in or­der to con­tain the pan­demic, or de­flect­ing ques­tions on how long the health cri­sis may last.</p>
    <p>But even by this low thresh­old of ex­pec­ta­tions, Mr John­son has not done well.</p>
    <p>His gov­ern­ment is per­ceived to have re­sponded too slowly to the on­set of the pan­demic. As a per­cent­age of the pop­u­la­tion, Bri­tain’s Covid-19 mor­tal­ity rates com­pare poorly with those of other na­tions.</p>
    <p>There has been a litany of er­rors about what health re­stric­tions should be im­posed.</p>
    <p>And the in­tro­duc­tion of com­puter ap­pli­ca­tions to trace in­fec­tions has been bun­gled re­peat­edly.</p>
    <p>Yet Mr John­son’s big­gest prob­lem is that he is not per­ceived as a man of de­tail at a time when de­tails about the state of the Bri­tish health ser­vice and the econ­omy mat­ter most.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish Premier re­cently got wrong even the de­tails of the health re­stric­tions he im­posed on some parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He also prefers to talk in grand gen­eral con­cepts rather than prac­ti­cal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At this week’s party con­fer­ence, for in­stance, he spoke about aim­ing for a “new Jerusalem”, an im­agery bor­rowed from Bi­b­li­cal ref­er­ences pop­u­lar with Bri­tish politi­cians two cen­turies ago, rather than the politi­cians of to­day.</p>
    <p>With an over­all ma­jor­ity of 80 in the 650-seat House of Com­mons and about four years re­main­ing to his cur­rent elec­toral man­date, Mr John­son’s gov­ern­ment has lit­tle to worry about.</p>
    <p>Still, there is deep un­ease within the Con­ser­va­tive Party, with many back­bench Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment wor­ried that al­though Mr John­son’s ad­vo­cacy for pulling Bri­tain out of the Euro­pean Union was the main source of his pop­u­lar­ity, the Prime Min­is­ter is now strug­gling to iden­tify a new and at­trac­tive na­tional ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>“John­son was a wartime gen­eral put in to de­liver a re­sult on the bat­tle­field, elected to de­liver Brexit,” Mr Roger Gale, a vet­eran Con­ser­va­tive MP, told the me­dia. But now, said Mr Gale: “I just won­der if he’s a rebel with­out a cause.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son sought to ad­dress these con­cerns head-on by telling his party stal­warts that his gov­ern­ment was work­ing “night and day to re­pel this virus”.</p>
    <p>His mis­sion, he claimed, is not “merely to re­store nor­mal­ity”, but to trans­form Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>High on his list of pledges is a prom­ise to step up the con­struc­tion of new homes.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said it was a “dis­grace­ful truth” that mil­lions of Brits were forced to pay rent on homes they could not truly make their own.</p>
    <p>“We will help turn gen­er­a­tion rent into gen­er­a­tion buy,” he claimed, by promis­ing to roll out long-term fixed-rate mort­gages of up to 95 per cent of the value of new homes.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain was also promised a big ex­pan­sion in the num­ber of newly built hos­pi­tals and schools.</p>
    <p>But al­though snap polls in­di­cate that the mort­gage pro­posal may be pop­u­lar, the gov­ern­ment’s cred­i­bil­ity is nose­div­ing, with sur­veys in­di­cat­ing that Mr Keir Starmer, the newly-elected Labour leader, has over­taken Mr John­son as the per­son those polled thought would make a bet­ter prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s stand­ing among Con­ser­va­tive Party mem­bers has also plunged.</p>
    <p>The party re­belled against its own gov­ern­ment this week over the adop­tion of some new pro­vi­sions deal­ing with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For the moment, the Prime Min­is­ter is safe.</p>
    <p>But un­less he re­gains cred­i­bil­ity fast and re­asserts his author­ity, he may find gov­ern­ing in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>And no­body knows this bet­ter than Mr John­son, who spent most of his ca­reer plot­ting the over­throw of prime min­is­ters he was sup­posed to serve.</p>
