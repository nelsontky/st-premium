    <p>When Ms Am­rit­pal Kaur ap­plied for a job at a lo­cal lo­gis­tics firm, she was un­sure whether she would even get a call back.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the 28-year-old did not have much prior ex­pe­ri­ence in the area. She was a hu­man re­source ex­ec­u­tive at a de­liv­ery com­pany when she was re­trenched in March af­ter the com­pany re­struc­tured.</p>
    <p>But SSW Lo­gis­tics, the com­pany she ap­plied to, was im­pressed by her will­ing­ness to learn and of­fered her a lo­gis­tics ex­ec­u­tive role, which in­volves var­i­ous tasks from billing cus­tomers to as­sist­ing in ad hoc projects.</p>
    <p>“I had ini­tial doubts about my abil­ity to cope with a new job scope and en­vi­ron­ment. I was re­ally lost when I first joined as I had no idea what was hap­pen­ing, but my col­leagues and su­per­vi­sors were re­ally pa­tient and help­ful,” she said.</p>
    <p>“This gave me the con­fi­dence to be­lieve in my­self and to per­form well in my du­ties.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur, who grad­u­ated with a busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion de­gree from pri­vate in­sti­tu­tion Ka­plan Sin­ga­pore last year, re­called feel­ing de­jected af­ter be­ing let go by her pre­vi­ous com­pany, where she had been work­ing for more than two years. Her worry about get­ting an­other HR role grew as in­ter­views with three com­pa­nies did not re­sult in job of­fers.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, I was not open to mak­ing a ca­reer switch, as I thought most com­pa­nies would hire some­one with rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence. I thought that I might not stand a chance if I were to ap­ply for an­other role apart from HR.”</p>
    <p>It took about two months of job hunt­ing be­fore SSW Lo­gis­tics of­fered Ms Kaur a job.</p>
    <p>Mr Bil­son Tay, the firm’s direc­tor of busi­ness devel­op­ment, said Ms Kaur pre­sented her­self well dur­ing the job in­ter­view and showed an ea­ger­ness to learn and un­der­take more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>As she did not have any prior lo­gis­tics ex­pe­ri­ence, the com­pany placed her on a nine-month lo­gis­tics pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme (PCP) in July to ease her tran­si­tion into the job. The pro­gramme is of­fered by Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) and the Sup­ply Chain and Lo­gis­tics Academy.</p>
    <p>The firm is pay­ing for her to at­tend the pro­gramme, but it can seek fund­ing sup­port from WSG once the nec­es­sary cri­te­ria are ful­filled.</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur, who now bet­ter un­der­stands in­dus­try ter­mi­nol­ogy and the pro­cesses that ware­houses can use to speed up their work­flow, is look­ing for­ward to de­vel­op­ing her new ca­reer path.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said: “Other than rel­e­vant skill sets, qual­i­fi­ca­tions and work ex­pe­ri­ence, a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude and the will­ing­ness to learn and to try are key at­tributes that we look for when hir­ing.”</p>
