    <p>Does “the para­dox of choice” ap­ply to ro­mance?</p>
    <p>This is psy­chol­o­gist Barry Schwartz’s the­ory that hav­ing too many op­tions ac­tu­ally makes you more stressed and paral­ysed when it comes to de­ci­sion-mak­ing – and less sat­is­fied with your even­tual pick.</p>
    <p>It may be one rea­son the sin­gle­tons on the re­al­ity se­ries</p>
    <p>In­dian Match­mak­ing have es­chewed the plenty-of-fish ap­proach to dat­ing.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they have turned to the in­sti­tu­tion of ar­ranged mar­riage and a dat­ing pool cu­rated by elite match­maker Sima Ta­paria, who jets be­tween the United States and In­dia play­ing Cupid to young Indians.</p>
    <p>The show has taken In­dia – where most mar­riages are ar­ranged – by storm. And while the core au­di­ence might be South Asian, it has been a sur­prise hit in the US as well, where it was one of Net­flix’s top 10 shows af­ter de­but­ing ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>But In­dian Match­mak­ing has po­larised its view­ers – mainly be­cause Ta­paria and her wealthy clients seem bliss­fully un­aware of, or un­con­cerned with, how sex­ist, ageist, clas­sist, colourist and even height­ist their stip­u­la­tions for suit­able matches are.</p>
    <p>The young peo­ple and their par­ents typ­i­cally in­sist on po­ten­tial mates be­ing from “a good fam­ily” – the right so­cio-eco­nomic class and caste – as well as ed­u­cated, fair-skinned, slim and not too short.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia has been awash with cri­tiques from those who have had trau­matic ex­pe­ri­ences with this sort of match­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Yet the show glosses over any is­sues with the process, in­stead splic­ing in short, cutesy, When Harry Met Sally-style tes­ti­mo­ni­als from match­made cou­ples who have been to­gether for decades.</p>
    <p>Wher­ever you stand on the ethics of this cus­tom, it makes for fas­ci­nat­ing fly-on-the-wall view­ing.</p>
    <p>The se­ries fits into the sub-genre of Western dat­ing shows that in­cludes Mar­ried At First Sight, 90 Day Fiance and Love Is Blind.</p>
    <p>But the cul­tural speci­ficity – and, for Indians in the US, “third-cul­ture kid” fac­tor – will add a layer of com­plex­ity that res­onates with view­ers in Asia and else­where.</p>
    <p>Ta­paria is also a hi­lar­i­ous apho­rism-gen­er­at­ing ma­chine, and the show milks this for all its worth. “Sima Aunty” memes are al­ready a thing.</p>
    <p>And even if you stren­u­ously ob­ject to some of her more du­bi­ous judg­ments and meth­ods – she con­sults an astrologer and “face reader”, for in­stance – a few are spot on, es­pe­cially when it comes to her more high-main­te­nance clients.</p>
    <p>As with any re­al­ity show, part of the fun is de­bat­ing how gen­uine some of the pathos and epipha­nies are – and re­ports have it that none of the cou­ples that were match­made are still to­gether.</p>
    <p>But, like ev­ery­body on this show does, feel free to judge each and ev­ery one of them.</p>
    <p>Kiss­ing Game, a Brazil­ian drama about an out­break of a mys­tery “kiss­ing virus” among teenagers, seems at first glance tai­lor-made for the Covid-19 era, al­beit un­in­ten­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>The story be­gins with high-school­ers in the small, con­ser­va­tive ranch town of Pro­gresso at­tend­ing a rave.</p>
    <p>Cue plenty of danc­ing, drug-tak­ing and sloppy kiss­ing.</p>
    <p>The next day, one of them wakes up scream­ing and hal­lu­ci­nat­ing, with a pur­ple mark on her lips.</p>
    <p>She soon be­comes se­ri­ously ill, the af­flic­tion turn­ing her into a dead-eyed zom­bie, at least emotionall­y.</p>
    <p>As the in­fec­tion spreads, it be­comes ap­par­ent the dis­ease was trans­mit­ted among those who kissed at the party.</p>
    <p>While their par­ents and teach­ers fly into a moral panic, some of the teenagers – Fran (Iza Mor­eira),</p>
    <p>Chico (Michel Joel­sas) and Alex (Caio Horow­icz) – use so­cial me­dia and a “kiss­ing map” to try and piece to­gether what hap­pened and find the source of the virus.</p>
    <p>As they do, any para­ble the viewer might read into this – about the virtues of so­cial dis­tanc­ing or the evils of teenage sex and drug-tak­ing – starts to break down.</p>
    <p>It is The Scar­let Let­ter meets Foot­loose as the fear­ful, con­trol­ling adults be­come the an­tag­o­nists, though the para­noia about con­ta­gion soon in­fects young and old, and the com­mu­nity grows in­creas­ingly di­vided.</p>
    <p>The idea of a phys­i­cal trans­for­ma­tion es­trang­ing chil­dren from their par­ents is a pretty on-the-nose me­taphor for ado­les­cence and sex­ual de­vel­op­ment, which the show also ex­plores through sev­eral gay char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>But this stylish, well-acted drama man­ages to just about avoid some of the more ob­vi­ous teen-spirit cliches, even though its con­clu­sion is a lit­tle corny.</p>
    <p>A pal­ette of jew­elled neon tones and a syn­the­sizer-heavy sound­track rem­i­nis­cent of Stranger Things also make it rather easy on the ears and eyes and, at just six episodes long, a breeze to get through. If only all viruses could be van­quished so quickly.</p>
