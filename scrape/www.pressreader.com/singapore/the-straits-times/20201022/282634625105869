    <p>• Asia’s big­gest an­nual film fes­ti­val started in South Korea yes­ter­day at a frac­tion of its usual scale, but some movie fans will still be able to at­tend screen­ings de­spite the coron­avirus forc­ing many events on­line.</p>
    <p>The Busan In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val (BIFF) usu­ally sees a host of stars and in­dus­try play­ers from Asia and else­where de­scend on the port city for 10 days of crit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tion and fi­nan­cial deal­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>But strict con­di­tions im­posed this year be­cause of the pan­demic mean there will be no open­ing cer­e­mony, red-car­pet pa­rades, af­ter-par­ties or out­door fan events.</p>
    <p>The fact it is tak­ing place at all, how­ever, is a bonus, as many in­ter­na­tional fes­ti­vals have gone on­li­neonly and some, such as Cannes, have been can­celled al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>This year marks the fes­ti­val’s 25th an­niver­sary and comes af­ter South Korean direc­tor Bong Joonho’s his­toric Os­car win for the dark com­edy Par­a­site (2019) in Fe­bru­ary – the first time a for­eign-lan­guage film has won top ac­co­lades.</p>
    <p>About 190 movies will be shown at this year’s fes­ti­val and only once each, com­pared with the typ­i­cal 300-odd films played mul­ti­ple times – an 80 per cent cut in to­tal screen­ings.</p>
    <p>Those at­tend­ing will have to wear masks, while so­cial dis­tanc­ing will be en­forced by mak­ing avail­able only a quar­ter of theatre seats.</p>
    <p>“We are do­ing our very best to of­fer what’s most es­sen­tial while fol­low­ing Covid-19 safety mea­sures,” BIFF pro­gramme direc­tor Nam Dong-chul said.</p>
    <p>“We think what’s most im­por­tant about film fes­ti­vals is to screen movies at movie the­atres, as cin­ema is an art form that re­quires big screens.”</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers have sched­uled about 45 pub­lic screen­ing talks – also far fewer than nor­mal – but fea­tur­ing only South Korean film-mak­ers and ac­tors.</p>
    <p>South Korea im­poses a strict twoweek quar­an­tine on most ar­rivals, mak­ing short vis­its im­prac­ti­cal, so or­gan­is­ers have not in­vited for­eign­ers – al­though some will par­tic­i­pate on­line.</p>
    <p>Among 70 world pre­mieres this year is the open­ing film Septet: The Story Of Hong Kong, a multi-direc­tor an­thol­ogy that pays trib­ute to the ter­ri­tory from the 1950s to the present.</p>
    <p>Directed by Tsui Hark, Ann Hui, Pa­trick Tam, John­nie To, Yuen Wo</p>
    <p>Ping, Sammo Hung and the late Ringo Lam, the movie hon­ours the golden age of Hong Kong cin­ema – from the 1960s to the 1990s.</p>
    <p>The ter­ri­tory was once the re­gional cin­e­matic pow­er­house, pro­duc­ing as many as 200 films a year that were devoured by cin­ema­go­ers across Asia and be­yond. But since then, the city’s movie stu­dios have gone into de­cline, eclipsed by flashier and wealth­ier ri­vals i n China and South Korea.</p>
    <p>“It was an era of ‘one hun­dred flow­ers bloom­ing’ – the free ex­pres­sion of art – that nur­tured nu­mer­ous movie tal­ents,” pro­duc­tion com­pany Me­dia Asia Film Hong Kong said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Most BIFF com­po­nents – in­clud­ing j udg­ing, press con­fer­ences, film and project mar­kets and dis­cus­sion fo­rums – will still be held dur­ing the fes­ti­val, but on­line.</p>
    <p>“It will cer­tainly be a dif­fer­ent fes­ti­val this year,” Dr Ja­son Becher­vaise, a pro­fes­sor at Korea Soongsil Cy­ber Uni­ver­sity, said.</p>
    <p>“Had we not been in this sit­u­a­tion, the fes­ti­val would no doubt have a cel­e­bra­tory at­mos­phere given the suc­cess of Par­a­site and the sub­se­quent at­ten­tion the South Korean film in­dus­try has had.”</p>
