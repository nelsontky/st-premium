    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he wants an even big­ger stim­u­lus than what Democrats have of­fered so far, seem­ing to un­der­cut his own ne­go­tia­tors, who had pre­pared a US$1.8 tril­lion (S$2.4 tril­lion) of­fer to make to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“I would like to see a big­ger stim­u­lus pack­age, frankly, than ei­ther the Democrats or the Repub­li­cans are of­fer­ing,” Mr Trump said on Rush Lim­baugh’s ra­dio pro­gramme, say­ing he is go­ing in the “ex­act op­po­site” di­rec­tion from his ear­lier stances.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin was head­ing into talks with Ms Pelosi on Fri­day car­ry­ing a White House of­fer of US$1.8 tril­lion for eco­nomic stim­u­lus, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Ms Pelosi has pro­posed a US$2.2 tril­lion plan, down from the US$3.4 tril­lion pack­age the House passed in May, but many Repub­li­cans in Congress have said they would op­pose any plan ap­proach­ing that size.</p>
    <p>“I’m telling you some­thing I don’t tell any­body else be­cause maybe it helps or maybe it hurts ne­go­ti­a­tions,” Mr Trump told Mr Lim­baugh. “I would like to see a big­ger pack­age.”</p>
    <p>It is an about-face by Mr Trump, who said last Tues­day he was pulling out of the pan­demic re­lief talks. It comes with the elec­tion three weeks away and polls show­ing him trail­ing Demo­crat Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Stocks had climbed to ses­sion highs on Fri­day on the first re­ports of the White House rais­ing its of­fer on coro­n­avirus re­lief, but failed to gain fur­ther steam from Mr Trump’s lat­est twist.</p>
    <p>There is still scep­ti­cism about whether a deal can be cut and trans­formed into leg­is­la­tion be­fore elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Majority Leader Mitch McCon­nell said ear­lier on Fri­day that there is prob­a­bly not enough time be­fore the elec­tion to bridge the “vast” dif­fer­ences on a new virus re­lief pack­age. “I be­lieve that we do need another res­cue pack­age, but the prox­im­ity to the elec­tions and the dif­fer­ences of opin­ion about what is needed are pretty vast,” he said.</p>
    <p>He later told reporters that even if an agreement on stim­u­lus is reached, his first pri­or­ity is se­cur­ing Se­nate con­fir­ma­tion of Mr Trump’s nom­i­nee for the Supreme Court. Hear­ings for Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett are sched­uled to be­gin to­mor­row with a fi­nal Se­nate vote as soon as next week.</p>
    <p>If Ms Pelosi and Mr Mnuchin get an agreement, Congress would then likely need two weeks or more to draft leg­isla­tive text and ap­prove it in the House and Se­nate. The Se­nate is on re­cess un­til Oct 19 and the House un­til mid-Novem­ber, but law­mak­ers have been told they can be called back with 24 hours no­tice to vote on any stim­u­lus deal.</p>
    <p>LAT­EST TWIST</p>
    <p>I’m telling you some­thing I don’t tell any­body else be­cause maybe it helps or maybe it hurts ne­go­ti­a­tions. I would like to see a big­ger pack­age.</p>
