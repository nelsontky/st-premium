    <p>BER­LIN • Ger­man po­lice have cap­tured the “Black For­est Rambo” – a heav­ily armed sus­pect ac­cused of steal­ing of­fi­cers’ weapons – af­ter a six-day man­hunt.</p>
    <p>Yves Rausch, 31, had fled into the for­est last Sun­day af­ter he man­aged to dis­arm four po­lice of­fi­cers, spark­ing a huge search op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral hun­dred of­fi­cers combed the area with the help of spe­cial forces, he­li­copters, snif­fer dogs and ther­mal imag­ing cam­eras for the fugi­tive, nick­named “Black For­est Rambo” by the Ger­man press af­ter pic­tures emerged of him dressed in com­bat gear.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter sev­eral days of search­ing for Yves Rausch, who had gone un­der­ground in the woods around Op­pe­nau, the po­lice suc­ceeded in mak­ing a pro­vi­sional ar­rest of the 31-year-old,” said po­lice in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“In con­nec­tion with this, four firearms were seized,” they added.</p>
    <p>The drama be­gan on the morn­ing of July 12 when po­lice were in­formed that a sus­pi­cious man was hang­ing around a hut in the for­est near the vil­lage of Op­pe­nau in south-western Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Four of­fi­cers sent to the scene said he co­op­er­ated at first when ap­proached. But then he “sud­denly and com­pletely un­ex­pect­edly” threat­ened them with a gun and made them put down their own weapons be­fore run­ning away with the of­fi­cers’ firearms.</p>
    <p>He was also be­lieved to be car­ry­ing a bow and ar­row and a knife.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, Op­pe­nau pros­e­cu­tor Her­wig Schae­fer de­scribed Rausch as a “weapons freak” with a “great affin­ity for arms”.</p>
    <p>Rausch has a long crim­i­nal record, in­clud­ing charges re­lated to the pos­ses­sion of il­le­gal weapons, theft and bod­ily in­jury. He re­ceived a ju­ve­nile sen­tence of 31/ years in 2010 af­ter</p>
    <p>2 he shot a fe­male friend with a cross­bow, se­ri­ously in­jur­ing her.</p>
    <p>Po­lice also found child pornog­ra­phy on his mo­bile phone while in­ves­ti­gat­ing him for the pos­ses­sion of ex­plo­sives last year.</p>
    <p>Schools, kinder­gartens and the lo­cal swim­ming pool were closed last Mon­day as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>Rausch has been home­less since au­tumn last year and had been squat­ting in the hut where he was spot­ted a week ago.</p>
