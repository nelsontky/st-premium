    <p>Mimi Lee’s dou­ble-crusted pies have been around since 2001 and I had for­got­ten how good they were un­til I had them again re­cently.</p>
    <p>In these Covid-19 times, home-based food busi­nesses are spring­ing up like mush­rooms af­ter rain and I am glad she has re­vived her busi­ness.</p>
    <p>I can­not imag­ine the work it takes to make short­crust pas­try from scratch, but that’s the prom­ise you get when you or­der one of her pies. The pas­try is made with French but­ter too.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can or­der the pies baked (80 cents more) or frozen. I get mine frozen and sim­ply brush them with beaten egg be­fore pop­ping them in the oven, still frozen. In 40 min­utes, the four golden brown pies are ready.</p>
    <p>The best one is the Steak & Guin­ness Pie ($9.80 frozen), filled with car­rots and chunks of beef in a ro­bust gravy. Don’t worry, it’s not bit­ter at all. This one is avail­able this month and next. If you eat beef, this is a must-or­der.</p>
    <p>The Steak & Mush­room pie ($9 frozen) is good too, don’t get me wrong. But the Guin­ness deep­ens the flavour of the stew.</p>
    <p>Clas­sic Chicken ($8 frozen), filled with bone­less chicken leg meat, is easy to like be­cause the meat is not dried out and the creamy gravy is so com­fort­ing on a rainy day.</p>
    <p>The Veg­etable pie ($7 frozen) is filled with po­tato, pump­kin, zuc­chini and mush­room. I will say, grudg­ingly, that it is much better than I ex­pect it to be.</p>
    <p>One thing very worth not­ing is this: Ms Lee’s pies are dou­ble-crusted but do not suf­fer that ul­ti­mate hor­ror – the soggy bot­tom.</p>
    <p>WHAT: Mim’s Fab­u­lous Pies OR­DER­ING INFO: Look for @mims­fab­u­lous­pies on In­sta­gram and com­plete the on­line form DE­LIV­ERY: Charges range from $10 to $25, de­pend­ing on dis­tance</p>
