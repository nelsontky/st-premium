    <p>When tech­nol­ogy trans­formed the cam­era, the shift from film to dig­i­tal sen­sors was just the be­gin­ning. As stand­alone cam­eras were ab­sorbed into our phones, they gained soft­ware smarts, en­abling them not only to cap­ture light but also to un­der­stand the con­tents of a photo and even recog­nise peo­ple in it.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar trans­for­ma­tion is now start­ing to hap­pen to maps – and it too is pow­ered by those ad­vances in cam­era tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In the next 20 years, our col­lec­tive un­der­stand­ing of a “map” will be un­recog­nis­able from the fa­mil­iar grid of roads and places that has en­dured even as the A-Z street at­las has been sup­planted by Google Maps.</p>
    <p>Be­fore long, count­less ob­jects and places will be cap­tured and recre­ated in three-di­men­sional dig­i­tal mod­els that we can view through our phones or even, at some stage, on head­sets.</p>
    <p>This dig­i­tal world might be pop­u­lated by our avatars, turned into a play­ing field for new kinds of games or used to dis­cover routes, build­ings and ser­vices around us.</p>
    <p>PLANET EARTH’S DIG­I­TAL TWIN</p>
    <p>No­body seems sure yet what the killer app for this “dig­i­tal twin” of planet earth might be, but that hasn’t stopped Sil­i­con Val­ley from rac­ing to build it any­way.</p>
    <p>Face­book, Ap­ple, Google and Mi­crosoft, as well as the de­vel­op­ers of Snapchat and Poke­mon Go, are all hop­ing to bring this “mir­ror world” to life, as a pre­cur­sor to the aug­mented re­al­ity (AR) glasses that many in tech see as the next big thing.</p>
    <p>To place vir­tual ob­jects in our world, our de­vices need to know the tex­tures and con­tours of their sur­round­ings, which GPS can­not see. But in­stead of send­ing out cars with pro­trud­ing cam­eras to scan the world, as Google did to build Street View over the past decade and a half, these maps will be plot­ted by hun­dreds of mil­lions of users like you and me.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is whether we even re­alise that we have been dra­gooned into Sil­i­con Val­ley’s army of car­tog­ra­phers.</p>
    <p>They can­not do it with­out us. This month, Google said it would ask Maps users to up­load pho­tos to Street View us­ing their smart­phones for the first time. Only hand­sets run­ning its AR soft­ware can con­trib­ute.</p>
    <p>As Mr Michael Abrash, chief sci­en­tist at Face­book’s Ocu­lus head­set unit, re­cently told Fast Com­pany magazine: “Crowd­sourc­ing has to be the pri­mary way that this works. There is no other way to scale.”</p>
    <p>That is why game de­vel­oper Niantic is en­list­ing its play­ers to cap­ture scans of the lo­cal points of in­ter­est that form gyms (the game’s “bat­tle­grounds”) and “PokeS­tops” in its best-known ti­tle, Poke­mon Go.</p>
    <p>“The more re­al­is­tic (they are), the cooler the game will be,” says Mr Yuji Hi­gaki, head of en­gi­neer­ing at Niantic. More than 635,000 lo­ca­tions have al­ready been mapped since Niantic’s scheme went live ear­lier this year, he says, each re­quir­ing dozens or even hun­dreds of scans to cre­ate a re­li­able dig­i­tal model.</p>
    <p>THE IN­CEN­TIVES</p>
    <p>Play­ers are in­cen­tivised to cap­ture a lo­ca­tion by the prom­ise of in-game items. De­pend­ing on how much you value free Poke Balls, that seems like a good deal for Niantic in re­turn for such valu­able data.</p>
    <p>But, cru­cially, play­ers must opt into the scan­ning ef­fort first. A se­ries of on-screen prompts urges them to “scan cau­tiously” and “be re­spect­ful of oth­ers”. “Putting up these prompts will re­duce the num­ber of peo­ple who up­load scans, but we are fine with that,” says Mr Hi­gaki.</p>
    <p>Poke­mon Go has another warn­ing for play­ers: not to scan in­side “pri­vate res­i­dences” or other non-pub­lic lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, Face­book is very in­ter­ested in non-pub­lic lo­ca­tions. Last year, it de­tailed a re­search project called Replica to cre­ate pho­to­re­al­is­tic mod­els of homes and of­fices.</p>
    <p>Face­book researcher­s wrote in a blog post that this “could help us to place your grandma’s dig­i­tal avatar in the seat next to you”.</p>
    <p>That may be a strong in­cen­tive after a year in which many of us have been un­able to visit grandma in real life. But ex­pe­ri­ence should teach us cau­tion about what big tech com­pa­nies have in mind when they ask to scan our liv­ing rooms.</p>
    <p>When Google was col­lect­ing im­ages for Street View, it emerged in 2010 that it was also in­ter­cept­ing data from open Wi-Fi net­works as cars drove by, in what it later con­ceded was a mas­sive pri­vacy vi­o­la­tion. Big tech com­pa­nies would be wise to fol­low Niantic’s ex­am­ple and ask for our ex­plicit con­sent be­fore suck­ing our data into the mir­ror-verse.</p>
    <p>With the lat­est in­no­va­tions in cam­era and map­ping tech­nol­ogy, our pho­tos can now be mined for far more valu­able data than was pos­si­ble a decade ago. We should think care­fully be­fore we blindly help Sil­i­con Val­ley com­mit another drive-by pri­vacy in­va­sion en route to the fu­ture.</p>
