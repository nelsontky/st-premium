    <p>In one of Jakarta’s most af­flu­ent neigh­bour­hoods, Ke­bay­oran Baru, a prop­erty ty­coon and his ex­tended fam­ily, con­sist­ing of 16 peo­ple, threw a birth­day party for his father, who is in his 70s.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting at a long ta­ble in their dou­ble-storey house, they belted out the cus­tom­ary ditty for the day and tucked into nasi tumpeng – turmeric rice fash­ioned into a cone with side dishes – which is a sta­ple for fes­tive oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Those gath­ered there that day were from dif­fer­ent house­holds but that did not stop them from chat­ting and min­gling freely, with­out any phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing. No one wore masks.</p>
    <p>“We are still one fam­ily,” the ty­coon, who de­clined to be named, told The Straits Times, adding that the fam­ily con­tin­ued to meet reg­u­larly for meals and bar­be­cues, de­spite the threat of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He said: “We eat out­doors or at the open-air ter­race when we are to­gether. We don’t want to be overly cau­tious and be in a sit­u­a­tion where the virus con­trols our lives. We have to con­trol it.”</p>
    <p>Away from pub­lic glare, rich In­done­sians are flout­ing the rules meant to curb the spread of Covid-19. But they are spared flak in the me­dia even if some bla­tantly post pictures and videos of them­selves par­ty­ing on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Un­der the rules, only a max­i­mum of five peo­ple from dif­fer­ent house­holds are al­lowed to gather, and they must all wear masks. Those who flout the rules are li­able to a fine of 250,000 ru­piah (S$23). This in­creases to 500,000 ru­piah for those who breach the rules for the sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>The penalties are a pit­tance for</p>
    <p>the wealthy.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the virus has also shown lit­tle re­gard for the rich and pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty ty­coon Yan­uar Ar­sad died of Covid-19 af­ter cel­e­brat­ing his 56th birth­day party in Au­gust. A photo of him hold­ing a glass of rare Ma­callan malt scotch whisky, with Health Min­is­ter Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto, had gone vi­ral on so­cial me­dia. Sev­eral mem­bers of the ty­coon’s fam­ily and em­ploy­ees also tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, more than 20 peo­ple liv­ing and work­ing in the Bali gov­er­nor’s of­fi­cial res­i­dence, Jaya Sabha, tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus. The gov­er­nor’s wife, who was asymp­to­matic, had in­fected the staff, in­clud­ing her gar­dener and but­lers.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A group of In&#xAD;done&#xAD;sian housewives posted a photo of them on a cy&#xAD;cling trip. Only one had a mask but it was low&#xAD;ered. One of them told The Straits Times: &#x201C;We have known each other for very long and we have been stay&#xAD;ing in touch con&#xAD;stantly... We are all fine and are free from the virus.&#x201D;</p>
