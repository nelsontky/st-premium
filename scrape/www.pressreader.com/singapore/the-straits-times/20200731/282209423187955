    <p>TOLEDO (Ohio) • Five months after Covid-19 halted the LPGA sea­son after only four events, the Tour re­turns to com­pe­ti­tion to­day with­out Gaby Lopez after she be­came the first LPGA player to test pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>The world No. 44 has with­drawn from the 54-hole Drive On Cham­pi­onship in Toledo, Ohio, and is self­iso­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>“I was very ex­cited to get back to play­ing on Tour after this long break and while I’m dis­ap­pointed I’ll have to wait a lit­tle longer, I’m glad I was able to get tested and to make sure I do not put any­one else at risk,” the 26-year-old two-time LPGA Tour win­ner said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“I am self-iso­lat­ing and will be fol­low­ing all the CDC and LPGA guide­lines to get back to com­pet­ing on</p>
    <p>Tour in a safe man­ner. I’m feel­ing good and look­ing for­ward to when I can re­turn to play­ing on Tour.”</p>
    <p>She added on Twit­ter that she is “feel­ing good and have only very mild symp­toms”.</p>
    <p>The Tour said Lopez would quar­an­tine for a min­i­mum of 10 days and would un­dergo an­other Covid-19 test be­fore be­ing al­lowed to com­pete again.</p>
    <p>She was the only pos­i­tive re­sult to come out of coro­n­avirus test­ing on Mon­day and the Tour is con­fi­dent in safety mea­sures and hope­ful of fin­ish­ing the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>A field of 144 at Iver­ness Club will end a 166-day break.</p>
    <p>The Marathon Clas­sic will be staged next week with­out fans at nearby Syl­va­nia, Ohio, so play­ers can have a bub­ble of sorts be­fore</p>
    <p>TAK­ING NEC­ES­SARY STEPS</p>
    <p>While I’m dis­ap­pointed I’ll have to wait a lit­tle longer, I’m glad I was able to get tested and to make sure I do not put any­one else at risk. ’’</p>
    <p>GABY LOPEZ , world No. 44 who be­came the first LPGA player to test pos­i­tive for Covid-19. The Tour restarts to­day at the Drive On Cham­pi­onship in Toledo, Ohio.</p>
    <p>head­ing to Scot­land for next month’s Scot­tish Open and Women’s Bri­tish Open, the first Ma­jor of the year, at Royal Troon.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing here, it feels even more real and hope­fully we have a pro­longed stretch of golf com­ing up and we can play the rest of the sea­son,” Eng­land’s Bronte Law said.</p>
    <p>“The LPGA is do­ing ev­ery­thing they can to pro­vide an en­vi­ron­ment that’s safe for us and the com­mu­nity around us.</p>
    <p>“This (course) will be a re­ally good test. It gets a lit­tle windy out there and there are some el­e­va­tion changes. You have to be smart.</p>
    <p>“After not play­ing for a while, be­ing thrown in at the deep end will cer­tainly be a chal­lenge but one ev­ery­body is cer­tainly ready for.”</p>
