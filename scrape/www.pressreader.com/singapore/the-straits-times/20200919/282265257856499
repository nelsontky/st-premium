    <p>• For­mer Deutsche Bank com­modi­ties trader David Liew told a Chicago jury he learnt how to ma­nip­u­late gold and sil­ver prices from the two suc­cess­ful se­nior traders he ad­mired and worked with for about three years.</p>
    <p>Liew said he wanted to be a team player and make money af­ter join­ing the bank’s Sin­ga­pore of­fice, so he be­gan do­ing “spoof” trades the way he was taught by Cedric Chanu and James Vor­ley.</p>
    <p>The se­nior traders of­ten placed buy and sell or­ders they never in­tended to ex­e­cute, a strat­egy in­tended to i nflu­ence prices so they could reap il­le­gal prof­its, Liew said.</p>
    <p>Vor­ley and Chanu are on trial for fraud and con­spir­acy, ac­cused of is­su­ing mul­ti­ple bo­gus trade or­ders be­tween 2008 and 2013.</p>
    <p>The case is the latest pros­e­cu­tion of “spoof­ing” trades brought by the United States, which has been crack­ing down on the prac­tice since the so-called “flash crash” a decade ago.</p>
    <p>“I saw Mr Vor­ley and Mr Chanu do it,” Liew, a grad­u­ate of the Lon­don School of Eco­nomics and the pros­e­cu­tion’s star wit­ness, said on Wed­nes­day in the US fed­eral court.</p>
    <p>Liew, who has pleaded guilty to spoof­ing charges and is co­op­er­at­ing with the gov­ern­ment in re­turn for le­niency, said he sat next to Chanu in Sin­ga­pore from 2009 to 2012 and com­mu­ni­cated daily on a live video chat with Vor­ley in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>While he knew ma­nip­u­lat­ing prices was wrong, Liew said spoof­ing trades were “so com­mon­place” in the mar­ket and among his co-work­ers that he as­sumed it was okay.</p>
    <p>In one of sev­eral trades Liew de­scribed in de­tail, he worked with Vor­ley on Aug 26, 2010, to push up gold prices.</p>
    <p>Liew said he put in an or­der to sell 15 fu­tures con­tracts, val­ued at around US$1.8 mil­lion (S$2.4 mil­lion) based on prices at the time, while Vor­ley placed an or­der to buy 80 con­tracts, which would have been worth about US$9.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>When prices rose, Vor­ley can­celled his buy or­der and Liew ex­e­cuted his sell or­der, he added.</p>
    <p>Liew said Vor­ley and Chanu would of­ten help him with his spam trades.</p>
    <p>If they saw he had an open sell or­der, they would put in a buy or­der to help him get a bet­ter price, ex­hibits pre­sented at the trial showed.</p>
    <p>Such co­or­di­nated spoof­ing could also be done by a lone trader plac­ing or­ders on each side of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Liew said he be­came so fa­mil­iar with spam­ming that he could tell when his col­leagues were do­ing it.</p>
    <p>One day, on notic­ing that Chanu was mak­ing such a trade, Liew sent him a mes­sage say­ing “be care­ful... don’t let the buy or­ders get into the mar­ket”, ac­cord­ing to a chat log and Liew’s tes­ti­mony.</p>
    <p>Vor­ley and Chanu con­tend their ac­tions were le­gal, and that can­celling or­ders is an ac­cepted bluff­ing strat­egy in the com­pet­i­tive world of high-fre­quency trad­ing, where com­put­ers use al­go­rithms to ex­e­cute mas­sive trades in mil­lisec­onds.</p>
    <p>None of the traders’ ac­tions was flagged by Deutsche Bank’s com­pli­ance depart­ment, de­fence lawyers said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Since anti-spoof­ing laws were passed un­der the Dodd-Frank fi­nan­cial re­forms in 2010, US fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors have stepped up crim­i­nal cases and the US Com­mod­ity Fu­tures Trad­ing Com­mis­sion has ini­ti­ated more civil com­plaints.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing cross-ex­am­i­na­tion, de­fence lawyers sought to dis­credit the claim that Chanu and Vor­ley in­ten­tion­ally can­celled trades.</p>
    <p>“There’s no but­ton that says what in­tent is,” de­fence lawyer Matthew Mazur said while ques­tion­ing Liew.</p>
    <p>Mr Mazur also noted that Liew must have been aware that his price ma­nip­u­la­tion was not le­gal.</p>
    <p>In an Aug 8, 2010, chat mes­sage to Chanu, Liew wrote: “Cause Dod­dFrank gonna get me fired, Ha Ha,” ac­cord­ing to a tran­script of the con­ver­sa­tion shown to ju­rors.</p>
