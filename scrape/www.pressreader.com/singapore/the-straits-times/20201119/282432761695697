    <p>More than 100 en­ti­ties – in­clud­ing pri­vate sports acad­e­mies and clubs, pri­vate league oper­a­tors and fa­cil­ity oper­a­tors – will be el­i­gi­ble to re­ceive up to $15,000 per month, or about 25 per cent of their to­tal op­er­at­ing ex­penses, from now till March next year as part of the $50 mil­lion Sports Re­silience Pack­age (SRP).</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­ual coaches reg­is­tered with the Na­tional Registry of Coaches (NROC) can re­ceive $10 per hour when they take up cour­ses run by CoachSG (be­yond the re­quired Con­tin­u­ing Ed­u­ca­tion hours), while those in the struc­tured men­tor­ing pro­gramme can re­ceive a monthly al­lowance of be­tween $400 and $600.</p>
    <p>Un­veiled i n Par­lia­ment last month by Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong, the SRP is aimed at help­ing the sports sec­tor cope with the ef­fects of the pan­demic, with Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) an­nounc­ing de­tails of the grant frame­work and el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria for busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In its me­dia state­ment, SportSG said: “The new mea­sures un­der the</p>
    <p>SRP aim to sup­port crit­i­cal play­ers in the sports ecosys­tem, to pre­serve core ca­pa­bil­i­ties in ath­lete path­ways and pipe­line de­vel­op­ment, as well as to catal­yse the in­dus­try to pro­vide in­no­va­tive sports for­mats for Sin­ga­pore­ans to con­tinue to stay ac­tive.”</p>
    <p>Pri­vate sports acad­e­mies and coaches were heart­ened by the sup­port from the SRP, which comes in the form of $13.5 mil­lion in op­er­at­ing grants to help crit­i­cal busi­nesses off­set op­er­at­ing costs and $11.5 mil­lion in ca­pa­bil­ity de­vel­op­ment for the in­dus­try. The pack­age is on top of $25 mil­lion in re­lief mea­sures for the in­dus­try that was an­nounced in June.</p>
    <p>SwimFast Aquatic Group, which has more than 1,000 reg­is­tered swim­mers across two school venues, was not able to con­duct lessons from April to July ow­ing to mea­sures to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19. They are now op­er­at­ing at about 70 per cent ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>SwimFast man­ag­ing di­rec­tor David Lim, who es­ti­mated his monthly op­er­at­ing cost to be about $80,000, said: “Every bit helps dur­ing this test­ing pe­riod, and the grant will def­i­nitely help us de­fray our costs. We have been look­ing for­ward to the de­tails since the SRP was an­nounced last month, and this is good news for us.”</p>
    <p>Ha­bil Hakim, a 31-year-old foot­ball coach with F17 Foot­ball Academy, said: “The cour­ses pro­vided by SportSG for NROC coaches have been of qual­ity be­fore the pan­demic and, as we gain knowl­edge and ab­sorb knowl­edge, we were col­lect­ing hours as well.</p>
    <p>“Now with an al­lowance, it would be of greater help for in­di­vid­ual coaches in tough times like this. At F17, we are op­er­at­ing at 40 per cent ca­pac­ity due to the re­stric­tions and we would have some time to go for the cour­ses and up­grade our­selves.”</p>
    <p>Other ini­tia­tives un­der the SRP in­clude the Blended Ini­tia­tive grant that sup­ports event man­age­ment com­pa­nies, event or­gan­is­ers and pri­vate acad­e­mies and clubs in the de­vel­op­ment of event and pro­gramme in­no­va­tion that engage par­tic­i­pants in “phy­gi­tal” event for­mats and/or pro­grammes. “Phy­gi­tal” events or pro­grammes are those that com­bine the phys­i­cal and vir­tual.</p>
    <p>There is also the En­ter­prise In­no­va­tion and Ca­pa­bil­ity De­vel­op­ment grant to sup­port the de­vel­op­ment and ap­pli­ca­tion of tech­nol­ogy and/or in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions in the sport in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Self-em­ployed pro­fes­sion­als, free­lance coaches as well as busi­nesses may also ap­ply for the Dig­i­tal Con­tent De­vel­op­ment Grant, which aims to en­hance the qual­ity of dig­i­tal sport pro­duc­tions and ex­pand their reach through host­ing con­tent on the Ac­tiveSG Cir­cle vir­tual plat­form.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion on the SRP, ap­pli­ca­tion de­tails and reg­is­tra­tion of in­ter­est is avail­able on the Ac­tiveSG Cir­cle web­site at go.gov.sg/srp2020.</p>
    <p>HELP­ING HAND</p>
    <p>Every bit helps dur­ing this test­ing pe­riod, and the grant will def­i­nitely help us de­fray our costs.</p>
