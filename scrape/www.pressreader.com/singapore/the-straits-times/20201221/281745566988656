    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land plans to test more than 10,000 peo­ple af­ter a record daily surge in coro­n­avirus cases to over 500, most of which were among mi­grant work­ers linked to a shrimp mar­ket near the cap­i­tal, an of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>By Wed­nes­day, the au­thor­i­ties aim to con­duct 10,300 tests in the south-west province of Sa­mut Sakhon, where the out­break ap­peared, and nearby prov­inces such as Sa­mut Songkhram and Nakhon Pathom, Mr Taweesin Wisanuyoth­in, a spokesman for Thai­land’s Covid-19 task force, told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“Ac­tive case find­ings will con­tinue in sev­eral prov­inces – ac­tu­ally, across the coun­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>Thai­land, the first coun­try out­side China to re­port coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, has largely kept the out­break un­der con­trol, with 4,907 cases and 60 deaths.</p>
    <p>The coun­try yes­ter­day con­firmed 576 new in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing 516 mi­grant worker cases an­nounced lo­cally the day be­fore.</p>
    <p>The new cases in­clude 19 lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases in Bangkok and in Sa­mut Sakhon province, where the 516 in­fec­tions were found.</p>
    <p>All of them were linked to the shrimp mar­ket in Sa­mut Sakhon.</p>
    <p>There were 41 im­ported cases. Most of the mi­grant work­ers in Sa­mut Sakhon are from Myan­mar, which has suf­fered a far worse out­break than Thai­land, where the health au­thor­i­ties credit early ac­tion with lim­it­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Other South-east Asian coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, have also re­ported thou­sands of cases among mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases in Thai­land comes just as it is seek­ing to re­vive a tourist in­dus­try dev­as­tated by the pan­demic. Last Thurs­day, it eased re­stric­tions to al­low more for­eign tourists to re­turn.</p>
