    <p>•</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors, in­sur­ers and ex­perts are warn­ing air­lines to take ex­tra care when re­ac­ti­vat­ing planes left in ex­tended stor­age dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, cit­ing po­ten­tial pilot rusti­ness, main­te­nance er­rors and even in­sect nests block­ing key sen­sors.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented num­ber of air­craft grounded amid the coron­avirus lock­downs – at one point af­fect­ing two-thirds of the global fleet – has caused a spike in re­ported prob­lems as air­lines re­turn them to ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­sta­bilised or poorly han­dled ap­proaches has risen sharply this year, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata). Such mishaps can re­sult in hard land­ings, run­way over­shoots or even crashes.</p>
    <p>Wor­ried by Iata’s data, in­sur­ers are ques­tion­ing air­lines about whether they are do­ing ex­tra pilot train­ing to fo­cus on land­ings, said Mr Gary Mo­ran, head of Asia avi­a­tion at in­sur­ance bro­ker Aon. “They want to know about the cir­cum­stances of the train­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ap­proaches and land­ings place sig­nif­i­cant de­mands on crew for which train­ing and reg­u­lar ex­pe­ri­ence are seen as vi­tal.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to air­craft maker Air­bus, the largest cat­e­gory of fa­tal ac­ci­dents can be traced back to the ap­proach to an air­port, while the largest num­ber of non-fa­tal ac­ci­dents hap­pen dur­ing land­ing.</p>
    <p>In May, a Pak­istan In­ter­na­tional Air­lines jet crashed af­ter an un­sta­bilised ap­proach, killing 97 peo­ple, while 18 died in an Air In­dia Ex­press crash on land­ing in Au­gust, also af­ter an un­sta­bilised ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Train­ing is not the only con­cern. The Euro­pean Union Avi­a­tion Safety Agency (Easa) has re­ported an “alarm­ing trend” in the num­ber of re­ports of un­re­li­able airspeed and al­ti­tude read­ings dur­ing the first flight af­ter a plane leaves stor­age.</p>
    <p>In some cases, take-offs had to be aban­doned or the air­craft had to re­turn to base. In most cases, the prob­lem was traced back to un­de­tected in­sect nests in­side the air­craft’s pitot tubes, pres­sure-sen­si­tive sen­sors that feed key data to an avion­ics com­puter.</p>
    <p>In June, a Wizz Air Hold­ings jet halted take-off af­ter the cap­tain found the airspeed was read­ing zero. Ex­am­i­na­tion of the plane found in­sect lar­vae in one of the pitot tubes, with the air­craft hav­ing been parked for 12 weeks be­fore the flight, said Bri­tain’s Air Ac­ci­dents In­ves­ti­ga­tion Branch last month. No pas­sen­gers were on board.</p>
    <p>In­sects block­ing a pitot tube con­trib­uted to the 1996 crash of a char­tered Bir­ge­nair plane in the Do­mini­can Repub­lic that killed all 189 peo­ple on board.</p>
    <p>Ms Kate Seaton, a Sin­ga­pore­based aerospace part­ner at law firm HFW, said flight crews need to be aware of po­ten­tial de­fects that might not have been iden­ti­fied prop­erly as planes re­turn to ser­vice af­ter an un­prece­dented ground­ing.</p>
    <p>“We are in new ter­ri­tory – the in­dus­try must take steps to mit­i­gate the risks but need to be pre­pared for the un­ex­pected,” she said.</p>
    <p>Easa said last month that is­sues found af­ter pro­longed park­ing in­cluded an en­gine shut­down in flight af­ter tech­ni­cal prob­lems, fuel sys­tem con­tam­i­na­tion, re­duced park­ing brake pres­sure and emer­gency bat­ter­ies los­ing their charge.</p>
    <p>Said Aon’s Mr Mo­ran: “We’ve got peo­ple re­turn­ing to work who are quite rusty, which is a big is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Air­lines have de­vel­oped train­ing pro­grammes for pilots re-en­ter­ing ser­vice, rang­ing from the­ory re­fresh­ers to mul­ti­ple sim­u­la­tor ses­sions, de­pend­ing on the length of ab­sence.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s avi­a­tion reg­u­la­tor said late last month that its in­spec­tors would beef up sur­veil­lance on Covid-19 re­lated risks in­volv­ing the re-en­try into ser­vice, pilot train­ing and safety risk man­age­ment for the re­main­der of the year through to June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>Pilots also need to make an hon­est as­sess­ment of their skills and con­fi­dence upon re­turn­ing to work, said In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Air Line Pilots’ As­so­ci­a­tions rep­re­sen­ta­tive Peter Meiresonne at an in­dus­try we­bi­nar in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>NEED TO WATCH OUT</p>
    <p>We are in new ter­ri­tory – the in­dus­try must take steps to mit­i­gate the risks but need to be pre­pared for the un­ex­pected.</p>
