    <p>It has been a while since lo­cal au­di­ences saw Sin­ga­porean ac­tress Jeanette Aw on their tele­vi­sion screens in Chan­nel 8 dra­mas – her most re­cent one be­ing Af­ter The Stars late last year.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause the 41-year-old has ex­panded her ca­reer be­yond Sin­ga­pore and act­ing to ap­pear in Chi­nese pro­duc­tions and di­rect, pro­duce and script short films.</p>
    <p>In a tele­phone in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Aw says go­ing from act­ing to di­rect­ing was a nat­u­ral pro­gres­sion for her.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing able to pro­duce your own script and film is very ful­fill­ing. Di­rect­ing is a lot about com­mu­ni­cat­ing and tak­ing care of the act­ing across the board, and to make sure ev­ery­thing feels right and in place,” she says.</p>
    <p>She made her short-film di­rec­to­rial de­but in 2018 with The Last En­try, which is about a woman who has Alzheimer’s dis­ease.</p>
    <p>This is a new fo­cus for the ac­tress as she ma­tures in her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“I want to ex­plore the ‘mak­ing’ as­pect of things, es­pe­cially di­rect­ing and writ­ing scripts. If I get bet­ter at short films, I might try fea­ture-length,” she says.</p>
    <p>Her lat­est film, Senses, was sup­posed to pre­miere in Ja­pan at the Takasaki Film Fes­ti­val – Aw is an am­bas­sador for the city – but the event was can­celled due to the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The film – about a blind woman, played by Aw, who is trav­el­ling in Takasaki – is avail­able on YouTube and on Pic­turesque­Films.com.</p>
    <p>“When we ex­plored how to do pub­lic­ity and pro­mo­tion for the city, I brought up the idea of a short film. In­stead of the usual tourism videos, I thought we could cre­ate a story,” says Aw, who be­came an am­bas­sador for the city in Gunma pre­fec­ture af­ter film­ing Eric Khoo’s Ra­men Teh (2018) there.</p>
    <p>She has an affin­ity with Ja­pan, hav­ing worked there mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>She acted in This Is Tokyo, a short film pro­mot­ing the city, which is show­ing at Tokyo’s Short Shorts Film Fes­ti­val & Asia this month.</p>
    <p>She also stayed in Tokyo briefly when she com­pleted her three­month Su­pe­rior Patis­serie course at culi­nary school Le Cor­don Bleu Tokyo late last year.</p>
    <p>The ac­com­plished baker has been keep­ing her fans busy with In­sta­gram videos of her bak­ing dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>She says: “The recipes I share are quite ba­sic and you can build on them, like the no-bake cheese­cake, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who don’t bake pro­fes­sion­ally ul­ti­mately want to en­joy the ex­pe­ri­ence of bak­ing, so when it’s some­thing sim­ple, they can cus­tomise it for them­selves and not feel like they’re only fol­low­ing a recipe.”</p>
    <p>Aw was one of the Seven Princesses of Me­di­a­corp – the broad­caster’s most bank­able young fe­male stars – in the early 2000s.</p>
    <p>Her ma­jor claim to fame is the epic pe­riod fam­ily drama The Lit­tle Ny­onya (2008), which re­mains one of Me­di­a­corp’s most-viewed dra­mas and was re­cently re­made for the Chi­nese mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Aw played the cen­tral roles of a mother-and-daugh­ter pair.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, who is of Per­anakan de­scent, says that while she did not man­age to watch the re­make, she is grate­ful for it.</p>
    <p>“I sud­denly had an i nflux of mes­sages with peo­ple rem­i­nisc­ing about my ver­sion. You usu­ally don’t ex­pect peo­ple to still be talk­ing about a drama 12 years later.”</p>
    <p>She was the hot favourite to win Best Ac­tress at 2009’s Star Awards, but cast­mate Joanne Peh bagged the tro­phy in­stead.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent episode of lo­cal talk show Hear U Out, hosted by Quan Yifeng, Aw cried while talk­ing about it.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing her emo­tional re­ac­tion on the show, she says: “It’s some­thing in my past, but it was the way Yifeng ex­pressed her feel­ings to me. You know, some­times, when some­one speaks to you, he or she just trig­gers some­thing in you.”</p>
    <p>Asked if neg­a­tive com­ments about her act­ing over the course of her ca­reer are still hurt­ful to her, she says: “Those things were re­ally long ago. I’ve gone to classes and im­proved my­self since then.</p>
    <p>“If it’s some­thing con­struc­tive, I’ll con­tinue to work hard. But at the end of the day, what moves me is that au­di­ences still re­mem­ber me af­ter 12 years.”</p>
    <p>Au­di­ences will next see Aw in a Chi­nese pro­duc­tion about the fash­ion in­dus­try, which she shot early this year in Bei­jing along­side Ma Yili and other Chi­nese stars.</p>
    <p>She says: “I’ve al­ways en­joyed act­ing in Chi­nese pro­duc­tions – their tech­niques, the equip­ment used, how ma­ture their in­dus­try is.</p>
    <p>“And you’re al­ways play­ing off re­ally great ac­tors in China be­cause with the tough com­pe­ti­tion there, the ac­tors put in their all to hone their craft.”</p>
    <p>She will also head to Malaysia to film hor­ror-ad­ven­ture se­ries The Fer­ry­man – Le­gends Of Nanyang, re­unit­ing with her love in­ter­est from The Lit­tle Ny­onya, Qi Yuwu.</p>
    <p>Like Qi, she is not some­one who en­joys the hor­ror genre.</p>
    <p>She says with a laugh: “I don’t like to watch hor­ror films. Why do I want to pay to scare my­self? But I was re­ally at­tracted to the story and there’s some­thing deeper to this se­ries be­yond the ghosts and the hor­ror.”</p>
