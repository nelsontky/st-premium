    <p>The con­di­tional move­ment curbs in sev­eral parts of Malaysia will be ex­tended for an­other two weeks af­ter an­other record num­ber of cases were re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to ex­tend the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol order in the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya, as well as the state of Se­lan­gor, was made based on the as­sess­ment of the health au­thor­i­ties, said Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob.</p>
    <p>He said of­fi­cers from the Health Min­istry deemed some of these ar­eas as high-risk lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“Tak­ing into ac­count this risk, the gov­ern­ment has agreed to ex­tend the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol order (CMCO) in Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and Se­lan­gor for 14 more days, from Oct 27 to Nov 9,” he said in a na­tional tele­vised ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The CMCO in the three ar­eas was first im­posed for two weeks on Oct 14 as the coun­try bat­tled a third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions that fol­lowed the state elec­tion in Sabah last month.</p>
    <p>Al­though all eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties are al­lowed un­der the CMCO, so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties and cross-dis­trict travel are barred.</p>
    <p>Only two in­di­vid­u­als are al­lowed to leave a house at a time. Those who have to cross dis­trict lines for work are re­quired to show their work passes.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions af­fect some 7.6 mil­lion res­i­dents in the Klang Val­ley, which is made up of Kuala</p>
    <p>Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and some dis­tricts of Se­lan­gor. The area ac­counts for 23 per cent of Malaysia’s 32 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The en­tire state of Sabah has also been un­der the CMCO since Oct 13.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced that it was ex­tend­ing it in the state for an­other two weeks, un­til Nov 9.</p>
    <p>The lat­est wave of in­fec­tions was</p>
    <p>caused by the two weeks of cam­paign­ing that pre­ceded the Sept 26 state polls, which drew politi­cians and elec­tion work­ers from all over Malaysia to the coun­try’s east­ern­most state. At that time, Sabah was al­ready hit by a spike in Covid-19 cases af­ter an out­break at a de­ten­tion cen­tre for il­le­gal mi­grants.</p>
    <p>The politi­cians and elec­tion work­ers have been blamed for car­ry­ing</p>
    <p>the virus back with them to Penin­su­lar Malaysia and Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­ported 1,240 Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, with seven new fa­tal­i­ties. The pre­vi­ous record high of 1,228 cases was re­ported last Satur­day. To date, Malaysia’s cu­mu­la­tive tally of cases stands at 27,805, with 236 deaths.</p>
