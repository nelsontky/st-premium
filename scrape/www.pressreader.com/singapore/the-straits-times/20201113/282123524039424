    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain’s econ­omy, which has strug­gled to main­tain its re­cov­ery from its coro­n­avirus lock­down crash, grew by a slower than ex­pected 1.1 per cent in Septem­ber from Au­gust, even be­fore the lat­est re­stric­tions on busi­nesses, of­fi­cial data showed.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists polled by Reuters had ex­pected a monthly growth rate of 1.5 per cent in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>In the July-to-Septem­ber pe­riod, gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) grew by a record 15.5 per cent com­pared with the pre­vi­ous three months, the Of­fice for Na­tional Statis­tics (ONS) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But that failed to make up for its nearly 20 per cent crash in the sec­ond quar­ter, which in­cluded most of the pe­riod when the coun­try was in the grip of its first coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Bank of Eng­land (BOE) said the world’s sixth-big­gest econ­omy was likely to shrink by a record 11 per cent this year be­fore grow­ing by just over 7 per cent next year. How­ever, since then, news of a po­ten­tially ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cine has raised hopes that next year’s bounce-back could be stronger than the forecast.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s econ­omy is be­ing propped up by more than £200 bil­lion (S$356 bil­lion) worth of emer­gency spend­ing and tax cuts or­dered by Fi­nance Min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak and by the BOE’s bond-buy­ing pro­gramme, which has been ex­panded to al­most £900 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>De­spite the huge sup­port, the Bri­tish econ­omy suf­fered the big­gest drop among ma­jor economies in an ONS com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>GDP re­mains al­most 10 per cent smaller than be­fore the pan­demic in the lat­est fig­ures, twice as big as the de­clines in Italy, Ger­many and France and nearly three times the size of the drop in the United States, the ONS said.</p>
    <p>Mr Su­nak said steps taken to re­strict the spread of Covid-19 have likely slowed eco­nomic growth since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s fig­ures show that our econ­omy was re­cov­er­ing over the sum­mer, but started to slow go­ing into au­tumn,” he said in a state­ment. “The steps we’ve had to take since to halt the spread of the virus mean growth has likely slowed fur­ther since then.”</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son or­dered most peo­ple in Eng­land to stay at home for a month from last week in an at­tempt to slow a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
