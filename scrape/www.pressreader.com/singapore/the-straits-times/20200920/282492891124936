    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial? This Philippe Starck-de­signed ho­tel screams In­sta­gram mag­net from the sec­ond you drive up to the en­try­way, with its colour­ful par­rot mu­ral high­lighted by a search­light, and eclec­tic Span­ish-tile crazy paving.</p>
    <p>Opened in 2016, the place is ob­vi­ously tar­geted at glo­be­trot­ting mil­len­ni­als, with its stylish rooms brim­ming with sleek steel fit­tings and cen­tral lo­ca­tion in Robertson Quay.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>My Loft Ter­race Room feels like a tiny New York apart­ment, with its clean lines and minute work space tucked into the mez­za­nine floor. I like that the mez­za­nine floor has enough headspace for me to stand up straight.</p>
    <p>Plans to plonk my­self on the comfy arm­chair in the out­door ter­race are scup­pered the sec­ond I open the glass door be­cause I in­hale a lung­ful of cig­a­rette smoke in­stead of fresh air. While the ho­tel has a no-smok­ing pol­icy, some naughty guest has ev­i­dently been smok­ing out­doors. The stern note in the room which states that a $200 fine will be levied on smok­ers does not seem to have been suf­fi­cient de­ter­rent.</p>
    <p>How is the ser­vice?</p>
    <p>Even be­fore Covid-19 made re­mote de­liv­ery rou­tine, the ho­tel won an award for Aura, its cute ser­vice de­liv­ery ro­bot which sends bot­tled wa­ter, tow­els, toi­letries and ameni­ties to guest rooms. While I did not have a chance to meet Aura, I did have a</p>
    <p>tai­lor­ing emer­gency, which ne­ces­si­tated a re­quest for a sewing kit. I left the room to get to a work­shop, but found the kit on the counter when I re­turned.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice at its restau­rant Beast & But­ter­flies was a bit patchy at break­fast as the restau­rant was ob­vi­ously un­der­staffed. The wait­ers were busy, but re­spon­sive to guests. Note to self: Get an early break­fast to avoid the crowd.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>I love per­fume, so I pounced on the work­shop the ho­tel of­fers in col­lab­o­ra­tion with lo­cal per­fumery Mai­son 21G. The ses­sion is a fun in­tro­duc­tion to scents and you get to make a cus­tomised fra­grance to take home.</p>
    <p>A QR code takes you to a quiz about your pref­er­ences and sug­gests scent com­bi­na­tions from the 32 bot­tles set out on a lazy su­san.</p>
    <p>You get to choose two scents to com­bine for your per­son­alised per­fume. You get 6g of oils to add to a 30ml bot­tle, which means you get a proper eau de per­fume at the end of the class.</p>
    <p>An­other work­shop op­tion is the cock­tail-mak­ing class con­ducted by Beast & But­ter­flies’ res­i­dent mixol­o­gist Vla­dyslav Ye­sepiv.</p>
    <p>Vlad is an en­thu­si­as­tic and sur­pris­ingly good teacher who walks me through the ba­sics of build­ing a cock­tail. I learn that smell is more im­por­tant than taste when de­cid­ing on what goes into a cock­tail.</p>
    <p>He also of­fers in­struc­tions on how to hold and shake a cock­tail shaker like a pro, some­thing I fail mis­er­ably at. None­the­less, un­der his kind guid­ance, I pro­duce a rather tasty cock­tail blend­ing vodka, el­der­flower and gin­ger syrups as well as lime juice.</p>
    <p>Verdict: Miss or bliss?</p>
    <p>If you are miss­ing the cos­mopoli­tan buzz of New York or the so­phis­ti­cated chill of Paris, M So­cial is a good op­tion. Stand­ing at the bar of Beast & But­ter­flies with its mir­rored sur­faces and flashy chan­de­liers, you can imag­ine your­self barhop­ping in the Big Ap­ple.</p>
    <p>Or hang out at the al­fresco ta­bles over­look­ing the Sin­ga­pore River in the late af­ter­noon with a cap­puc­cino to peo­ple-watch as jog­gers, fam­i­lies and as­sorted dogs go by. Squint a lit­tle and it might look like a Euro­pean river­side scene.</p>
    <p>HOT TIP</p>
    <p>On Fri­days, Beast & But­ter­flies of­fers Fine De Claire oys­ters from France at just $1 a piece. And if you ask nicely, chef Bryce Li can whip up his sig­na­ture Thai-in­spired vinai­grette for the oys­ters.</p>
