    <p>WELLING­TON • The fa­ther of slain three-year-old Mu­caad Ibrahim, the youngest vic­tim in the New Zealand mosque shoot­ings, told the white su­prem­a­cist who gunned down his son that true jus­tice awaited him in the next life and it would be more se­vere than prison.</p>
    <p>“You have killed my son and to me, it is as if you have killed the whole of New Zealand,” Mr Aden Ibrahim Diriye said in a state­ment read by a fam­ily mem­ber dur­ing a sen­tenc­ing hear­ing for gun­man Bren­ton Tar­rant yes­ter­day. “Know that true jus­tice is wait­ing for you in the next life and that will be far more se­vere. I will never for­give you for what you have done.”</p>
    <p>Tar­rant, a 29-year-old Aus­tralian, is sched­uled to be sen­tenced this week af­ter plead­ing guilty to 51 mur­ders, 40 at­tempted mur­ders and one charge of com­mit­ting a ter­ror­ist act dur­ing the shoot­ing ram­page on March 15 last year in Christchur­ch which he livestream­ed on Face­book.</p>
    <p>A mur­der con­vic­tion car­ries a manda­tory sen­tence of life i n prison. The judge can im­pose a life term without pa­role.</p>
    <p>Sur­vivors and fam­i­lies of vic­tims have ad­dressed the court this week and many have urged the judge to sen­tence Tar­rant to the most se­vere sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Mr Diriye, a refugee from So­ma­lia who moved to New Zealand 25 years ago, told the court his son had been robbed of a fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“He used to en­gage and play with the po­lice; at home he would run around the house pre­tend­ing to be a cop and wear po­lice uni­form. We thought one day he might be­come a po­lice of­fi­cer,” he said.</p>
    <p>While most of Tar­rant’s vic­tims were at Al Noor mosque, in­clud­ing Mu­caad, he also killed seven peo­ple at the Lin­wood mosque.</p>
    <p>Mr Ahad Nabi, who l ost his 71-year-old fa­ther in the at­tack, stared at Tar­rant be­fore de­liv­er­ing a pas­sion­ate state­ment, de­mand­ing that Tar­rant should “never walk free” for his cow­ardly ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“You are weak, a sheep with a wolf’s jacket on for only 10 min­utes of your whole life,” said Mr Nabi, re­fer­ring to the shoot­ing ram­page.</p>
    <p>“This world was cre­ated with colour, a peas­ant like you will never change the hu­man race.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sara Qasem, daugh­ter of vic­tim Ab­delfat­tah Qasem, said she would miss smelling her fa­ther’s sauce cook­ing and wanted to hear his sto­ries about the “olive trees in Pales­tine”.</p>
    <p>“You made a choice here – a con­scious, stupid, ir­re­spon­si­ble, cold­blooded, self­ish, dis­gust­ing, heinous, evil choice,” she said, look­ing at Tar­rant, seated and sur­rounded by guards.</p>
    <p>Tar­rant, who is rep­re­sent­ing him­self, will not speak ahead of his sen­tenc­ing. He has di­rected a lawyer as­sist­ing the court to make a brief state­ment on his be­half.</p>
    <p>You made a choice here – a con­scious, stupid, ir­re­spon­si­ble, cold-blooded, self­ish, dis­gust­ing, heinous, evil choice. ’’ MS SARA QASEM, daugh­ter of vic­tim Ab­delfat­tah Qasem</p>
