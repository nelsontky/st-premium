    <p>Sin­ga­pore is us­ing a tiered sys­tem for en­try into the Repub­lic, de­pend­ing on the sever­ity of the coro­n­avirus spread in each coun­try or ter­ri­tory. Here is a break­down of the re­stric­tions for trav­ellers who have vis­ited these ter­ri­to­ries in the past 14 days.</p>
    <p>GEN­ERAL RULES</p>
    <p>For all coun­tries with­out spe­cific re­stric­tions, cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents, long-term pass hold­ers and in-prin­ci­ple ap­proval (IPA) hold­ers are al­lowed en­try into Sin­ga­pore, while short-term vis­i­tors are not – ex­cept with a valid ap­proval let­ter.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents are re­quired to serve their 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties and have a Covid-19 swab test dur­ing their SHN pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Long-term pass hold­ers and IPA hold­ers are re­quired to have a neg­a­tive Covid-19 swab test taken no more than 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture to be al­lowed en­try. They are also re­quired to serve their 14-day SHN at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity and to have another swab test dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>

    <p>• Main­land China</p>
    <p>• New Zealand</p>
    <p>• Tai­wan</p>
    <p>• Viet­nam</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents are al­lowed en­try with­out the need to serve an SHN, but must take a swab test on ar­rival and self-iso­late while wait­ing for re­sults.</p>
    <p>The same re­stric­tions ap­ply for long-term pass hold­ers, IPA hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors us­ing an air travel pass.</p>

    <p>• New South Wales, Aus­tralia Cit­i­zens, long-term pass hold­ers, IPA hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors are al­lowed en­try, pro­vided they serve a seven-day SHN at their own ac­com­mo­da­tion and take a swab test dur­ing their SHN. The ex­cep­tion: Air travel pass hold­ers from New South Wales have not been al­lowed into Sin­ga­pore since Dec 23.</p>
    <p>COUN­TRIES WITH THE MOST SE­VERE RE­STRIC­TIONS</p>
    <p>• United King­dom</p>
    <p>• South Africa</p>
