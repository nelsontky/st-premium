    <p>For­mer Re­form Party (RP) chair­man Andy Zhu has formed a new po­lit­i­cal party, along with seven other for­mer RP mem­bers in­clud­ing for­mer trea­surer No­raini Yunus.</p>
    <p>The 11-mem­ber Sin­ga­pore United Party (SUP) was reg­is­tered as a so­ci­ety on Dec 24, a no­tice in the Gov­ern­ment Gazette shows.</p>
    <p>The move has re­vived talk of con­flict within the RP, which is led by Mr Kenneth Je­yaret­nam.</p>
    <p>Last Au­gust, Mr Zhu and Ms No­raini were not reap­pointed to the Cen­tral Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mit­tee (CEC) fol­low­ing un­spec­i­fied al­le­ga­tions, in­clud­ing from Mr Je­yaret­nam, that Mr Zhu had made changes to the party’s pay­ment meth­ods without of­fi­cial ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhu said then that his sus­pen­sion be­fore al­le­ga­tions against him had been re­solved was un­fair.</p>
    <p>He also dis­puted Mr Je­yaret­nam’s claim that the en­tire CEC had been unan­i­mous in his and Ms No­raini’s sus­pen­sions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Zhu, 38, who had been party chair­man for nine years be­fore he was re­moved, told The Straits Times that all par­ties in­volved had moved on from the episode and that the SUP is not a break­away fac­tion of the RP.</p>
    <p>“It is com­mon for peo­ple to leave and join (po­lit­i­cal par­ties). Since I’ve been in RP for so many years, the peo­ple I know are mostly from RP, so it is rea­son­able that many of the mem­bers in SUP have links to RP,” said Mr Zhu, who will lead SUP as its sec­re­tary-gen­eral.</p>
    <p>“We are not a party that has split from RP, we are just a group of like­minded peo­ple com­ing to­gether,” he added yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Most of the new party’s mem­bers used to be in the RP, in­clud­ing two of Mr Zhu’s run­ning mates in Ang Mo Kio GRC in last year’s gen­eral elec­tion – Mr Dar­ren Soh and Ms No­raini. The RP team won 28.09 per cent of the vote against the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team led by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>The only three mem­bers with no for­mer ties to the RP are Ms Joyce Tan, a for­mer Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party mem­ber; Mr Choo Zin Chye, who is Mr Zhu’s father; and Mr Kenneth Zhang.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhu, who owns a food and bev­er­age busi­ness, said the party hopes to ad­dress bread-and-but­ter is­sues, among other things, though it is still de­vel­op­ing its man­i­festo.</p>
    <p>“Some of our fo­cus ar­eas would in­clude the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund sys­tem, hous­ing, ed­u­ca­tion, and health­care ben­e­fits...</p>
    <p>“From my past ex­pe­ri­ences walk­ing the ground in Ang Mo Kio and West Coast, res­i­dents there are much more con­cerned about such bread-and-but­ter is­sues, and I hope to bet­ter un­der­stand res­i­dents’ needs... and make their voices ahead,” said Mr Zhu, who also con­tested West Coast GRC in 2011 and 2015 as an RP can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who is the SUP’s chair­man, said the party hopes to of­fer al­ter­na­tive pol­icy pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>“My ut­most con­cern is for SUP to be (seen as) cred­i­ble in the pub­lic’s eyes,” said the 35-year-old, who works in com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal de­fence lawyer Charles Yeo, who con­tested Ang Mo Kio GRC along­side Mr Zhu and re­placed him as party chair­man last Au­gust, de­clined to com­ment when con­tacted, say­ing that the party will put up a state­ment on the mat­ter soon.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has con­tacted Mr Je­yaret­nam for com­ment.</p>
