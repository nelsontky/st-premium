    <p>• Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo said yes­ter­day that the au­thor­i­ties would en­sure In­done­sia is pre­pared to host the Fifa Un­der-20 World Cup next year, in­clud­ing by estab­lish­ing “strict health pro­to­cols” to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment has cho­sen six cities, in­clud­ing Jakarta and Bali, to host the tour­na­ment from May 20 to June 12.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing is we have to make sure that In­done­sia has pre­pared strict health pro­to­cols so it would be very safe to visit and to host the U-20 (World Cup) 2021,” he told Cabi­net min­is­ters in a broad­cast meet­ing.</p>
    <p>World foot­ball’s gov­ern­ing body Fifa had de­cided not to hold open­ing and clos­ing cer­e­monies due to the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to In­done­sia’s chief devel­op­ment min­is­ter, Muhad­jir Ef­fendy.</p>
    <p>With the high­est num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and deaths in South-east Asia, the au­thor­i­ties have been strug­gling to con­tain the out­break in the ar­chi­pel­ago of more than 17,000 is­lands.</p>
    <p>The world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous coun­try had recorded over 360,000 Covid-19 cases, with more than 12,600 deaths.</p>
    <p>Last year, In­done­sia won the host­ing rights for the bi­en­nial tour­na­ment, beat­ing out bids from Brazil and Peru.</p>
    <p>Fifa and the ap­pointed lo­cal au­thor­ity were yet to de­cide on the size of crowds to be al­lowed into sta­di­ums, while en­sur­ing safety, sports min­is­ter Zain­udin Amali told the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“We hope that in May-June, au­di­ences will be al­lowed, whether with half or a lim­ited ca­pac­ity of the sta­dium,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also added that In­done­sia’s in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ments were on track, in­clud­ing sta­di­ums, train­ing and other sup­port­ing fa­cil­i­ties, to wel­come vis­i­tors dur­ing the event.</p>
    <p>How­ever, one cause for con­cern is that the coun­try’s top foot­ball leagues have not re­sumed de­spite many ma­jor sports com­pe­ti­tions be­ing played be­hind closed doors in other parts of the world.</p>
