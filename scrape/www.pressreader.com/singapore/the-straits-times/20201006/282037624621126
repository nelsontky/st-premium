    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s pub­lic trans­port sys­tem has been ranked top in the world by US-based travel web­site Far & Wide, beat­ing London in sec­ond place and Hong Kong in third place, among other cities.</p>
    <p>The web­site cited high com­muter sat­is­fac­tion rates and af­ford­able charges, even for tourists, for the Re­pub­lic’s top billing.</p>
    <p>Tourists pay $10 for un­lim­ited rides on buses and trains for a day in Sin­ga­pore. A sim­i­lar pass in Madrid and London costs about $13 and $22 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s tourist travel pass also costs about $10 a day, but chil­dren aged three to 11 ride for about $5 a day. In Sin­ga­pore, chil­dren who are 0.9m tall and be­low ride for free.</p>
    <p>Far & Wide cited an in­ter­na­tional sur­vey by con­sult­ing firm McKin­sey in 2018 for Sin­ga­pore tak­ing top spot in its “Cities with Best Pub­lic Trans­porta­tion” rank­ing. The McKin­sey sur­vey showed that about 86 per cent of re­spon­dents were sat­is­fied with Sin­ga­pore’s pub­lic trans­port sys­tem, the high­est score among the top 10 cities.</p>
    <p>“Why are so many peo­ple pleased? To start, Sin­ga­pore boasts cut­ting-edge elec­tronic ser­vices, in­clud­ing a newly en­hanced trip plan­ner, and tick­et­ing op­tions, like an easy-to-use ez-link card that hand­ily con­nects to an app,” said Far & Wide.</p>
    <p>The web­site also noted that the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment was un­der­tak­ing am­bi­tious plans to fur­ther ex­pand and in­crease the re­li­a­bil­ity of the MRT sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Authority an­nounced last week that as part of im­prove­ments to the pub­lic trans­port net­work, it has bought 40 new trains for the NorthSouth and East-West MRT lines, the first of which will start run­ning in 2024.</p>
    <p>Far & Wide is run by par­ent com­pany Gran­ite Me­dia, which was launched in July 2017. In­clud­ing Far & Wide, Gran­ite has six con­sumer sites un­der its port­fo­lio fo­cused on top­ics such as par­ent­ing, pets and sports.</p>
    <p>Paris and Madrid rounded off the top five in Far & Wide’s rank­ing for pub­lic trans­port, plac­ing fourth and fifth re­spec­tively.</p>
