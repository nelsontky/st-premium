    <p>HAPPY BIRTH­DAY, KIT CHAN: Home-grown singer Kit Chan and Hong Kong ac­tress Sheren Tang are known to be good friends, and Tang was one of the first to wish her a happy birth­day when Chan turned 48 on</p>
    <p>Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In a 12.55am Weibo post that day, Tang, 54, wrote in Chi­nese: “A sin­cere birth­day bless­ing for my good friend Kit Chan. I wish you hap­pi­ness and to do the things that you wish.”</p>
    <p>She said she had sought Chan’s per­mis­sion to post the photo, some­thing she should do even though they are good friends.</p>
    <p>She used a Chi­nese phrase, “true friend­ship can be bland like water”, before adding “but it can be sweet like honey too”.</p>
    <p>Tang, who has starred in tele­vi­sion se­ri­als such as I Have A Date With Spring (1996) and War</p>
    <p>And Beauty (2004), posted a photo of her and Chan seem­ingly about to kiss.</p>
    <p>This was a ref­er­ence to Chan’s June 2019 so­cial me­dia posts of them trav­el­ling in Scot­land, in­clud­ing one of Chan kiss­ing Tang on the face.</p>
    <p>The photo sparked spec­u­la­tion among ne­ti­zens that they had “come out” as lovers.</p>
    <p>Tang and Chan re­futed the on­line chat­ter a few days later.</p>
    <p>Tang, who is sin­gle, joked that she likes men, even though she knew she could be “very man”.</p>
    <p>Chan, known for hits such as Home and Heartache, also urged peo­ple not to gos­sip as she said they would both be “side­lined” by men with such talk.</p>
    <p>She di­vorced in 2017 after five years of mar­riage to a fi­nance di­rec­tor.</p>
