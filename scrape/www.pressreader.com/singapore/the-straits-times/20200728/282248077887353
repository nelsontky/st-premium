    <p>As a sports fan, you should be an­gry for Yu Shu­ran.</p>
    <p>You should be hor­ri­fied that the ice skater was al­legedly first hit by her coach in China when she was 11. You should be fu­ri­ous that slap­ping, kick­ing, abus­ing, fat-sham­ing and sex­ual as­sault of ath­letes world­wide is still more preva­lent than you might think.</p>
    <p>You should be as­ton­ished that in a world ob­sessed with goal lines, base­lines and free-throw lines, the most vi­tal line is of­ten ig­nored. It’s the com­mon sense line, the moral line, the line which de­ter­mines how far any­one should go.</p>
    <p>A kid in sport doesn’t know what that line is. Doesn’t know that a slap is un­ac­cept­able in train­ing, or if it’s time to stop prac­tis­ing be­cause their an­kle hurts too much, or how to man­age their strug­gle with weight. But it’s OK, some­one will tell them where the line is, some­one whose job is to lift them, pro­tect them, guide them. The coach.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept what hap­pens when the coach doesn’t know where the line is or doesn’t even care? Who calls the ath­lete “fat” and “stupid” in front of the team and makes them com­pete again and again on that swollen an­kle. Who steals away the young ath­lete’s soar­ing love of the game and bruises a child­hood that can’t ever be given back.</p>
    <p>You should be grate­ful for the in­nu­mer­able coaches who, of­ten for low wages, ca­jole and in­spire and know the dif­fer­ence be­tween suf­fer­ing and sadism. Yet you should be wor­ried be­cause Yu’s de­tail­ing of the phys­i­cal abuse she suf­fered is sad yet un­sur­pris­ing. In the name of chas­ing great­ness we of­ten lose sight of the line and in pur­suit of suc­cess we’ve kicked fun out of the park. In the hunt for a medal, sport will ca­su­ally tram­ple on a child’s in­no­cence.</p>
    <p>You should be alarmed that when</p>
    <p>Hu­man Rights Watch re­leased a re­port ti­tled Abuse of Child Ath­letes in Ja­pan this year, its head­line was a quote by an ath­lete about a coach: “I Was Hit So Many Times I Can’t Count”. Later the ath­lete added: “I was bleed­ing, but he did not stop hitting me. I did say that my nose was bleed­ing, but he did not stop.”</p>
    <p>A hockey stick might rear­range a player’s nose and a fall in cy­cling might rip an ath­lete’s leg, but bleed­ing isn’t part of a coach’s ter­ri­tory. This is bul­ly­ing and isn’t fun, this is bru­tal­ity and it can’t be camouflage­d as dis­ci­pline.</p>
    <p>You should, as a devoted fan, step away from the beauty of sport for an in­stant and con­front its ug­li­ness. Part of the Ja­pan re­port was an on­line sur­vey and of 381 re­spon­dents, 24 years old and younger, “19 per cent in­di­cated that they had been hit, punched, slapped, kicked, knocked to the ground, or beaten with an ob­ject while par­tic­i­pat­ing in sports”.</p>
    <p>A 2019 Cana­dian sur­vey of 1,001 ath­letes found “the most com­monly ex­pe­ri­enced form of harm was psy­cho­log­i­cal” (cur­rent ath­letes: 17 per cent; re­tired ath­letes, 23 per cent) and most of it was ex­pe­ri­enced from coaches.</p>
    <p>In South Korea last year, wrote the Wash­ing­ton Post, a sur­vey by the coun­try’s Hu­man Rights Com­mis­sion of more than 1,000 pro­fes­sional ath­letes found “one-quar­ter and one-tenth of the re­spon­dents said they had ex­pe­ri­enced phys­i­cal abuse and sex­ual abuse, re­spec­tively”.</p>
    <p>You should chew over those num­bers. You should con­sider that if sport is a hu­man right, then this is a vi­o­la­tion of it. You should won­der if we’ve en­dorsed the idea that it’s OK for coaches to use any means if it just might make an ath­lete bet­ter. You should also ask, is this the way to find a young per­son’s best self?</p>
    <p>You should ap­pre­ci­ate that ath­letes are too young to protest; too fear­ful of los­ing their spots in pres­ti­gious academies; too in­tim­i­dated by the coach; too full of guilt be­cause of the fi­nan­cial in­vest­ments their par­ents have made in their train­ing; too scared of be­ing called weak if they can’t han­dle a drill; too con­vinced by the ab­surd logic of oth­ers that any beat­ing is for their own good.</p>
    <p>So you should then ask: But what are the adults do­ing? The as­sis­tant coaches, phys­ios, team man­agers, par­ents. Does no one see any­thing? Is there an un­end­ing pres­sure on ev­ery­one to de­liver? Is scan­dal too costly a propo­si­tion?</p>
    <p>You should ru­mi­nate on the idea of tough­ness be­cause it’s been mythol­o­gised to the point where we don’t even com­pre­hend the word prop­erly. Let’s just say it’s more pro­found than re­sist­ing a rugby tackle or play­ing a five-hour ten­nis marathon. Tough­ness is the Amer­i­can gym­nasts in the doc­u­men­tary Ath­lete A who speak out in court and it is Yu start­ing an im­por­tant con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Yu is in­spi­ra­tional be­cause she is set­ting a strong ex­am­ple, she’s tired of be­ing silent, she’s shin­ing a light on abuse, she’s tak­ing a stand for her peers, and she’s do­ing at 19 what adults should have done.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing a clear line.</p>
    <p>You should be wor­ried be­cause Yu’s de­tail­ing of the phys­i­cal abuse she suf­fered is sad yet un­sur­pris­ing. In the name of chas­ing great­ness we of­ten lose sight of the line and in pur­suit of suc­cess we’ve kicked fun out of the park. In the hunt for a medal, sport will ca­su­ally tram­ple on a child’s in­no­cence.</p>
