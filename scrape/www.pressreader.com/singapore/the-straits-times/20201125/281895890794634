    <p>It has be­come abun­dantly clear that there are Umno MPs will­ing to de­feat their own gov­ern­ment’s bud­get. But that would de­pend on whether any­one can gather the num­bers to oust Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>While his 112-strong Perikatan Na­sional (PN) has the nar­row­est par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity in Malaysian his­tory, merely re­duc­ing his sup­port to fewer than half of the 220 mem­bers of the Lower House – two seats are cur­rently va­cant – does not nec­es­sar­ily mean a change of gov­ern­ment is at hand.</p>
    <p>The rum­blings ahead of the cru­cial Bud­get 2021 vote come amid spec­u­la­tion that op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim has once again signed up some of Umno’s 38 fed­eral law­mak­ers in a re­newed bid to take power.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of try­ing to con­vince peo­ple that he has the num­bers, An­war has been ex­plain­ing how his planned re­forms need to be tem­pered for now due to the over­pow­er­ing Malay na­tion­al­ist sen­ti­ment. It ap­pears as if he is con­fi­dent enough to al­ready start out­lin­ing his gov­ern­ment’s agenda,” a source privy to the pri­vate dis­cus­sions told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>In West­min­ster par­lia­men­tary sys­tems, fail­ure to ap­prove spend­ing – or “loss of sup­ply” – is con­sid­ered to be a vote of no con­fi­dence in the gov­ern­ment, which should lead to the prime min­is­ter re­sign­ing or ad­vis­ing the head of state to dis­solve the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>But at­tempt­ing to force such a sit­u­a­tion in­volves a con­vo­luted cal­cu­lus, not least be­cause the monarch, King Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, has re­peat­edly called on law­mak­ers to en­sure the pas­sage of the bud­get so as to fund the fight against a resur­gent coro­n­avirus out­break and its eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>Still, Datuk Seri An­war’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) in­sists there is time for a new bud­get to be tabled. But the key is­sue is whether he can muster a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity, as the op­po­si­tion is not fully be­hind an An­war premier­ship.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral top Umno law­mak­ers have in­di­cated un­will­ing­ness to back the coun­try’s largest-ever bud­get. These in­clude for­mer premier Na­jib Razak – now back­bencher chief for the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional coali­tion that is the largest bloc in the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion – and Umno ad­vi­sory coun­cil chief, Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah.</p>
    <p>Even Umno chief Zahid Hamidi last week urged the gov­ern­ment to prove its le­git­i­macy by tabling a con­fi­dence mo­tion.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is dire enough that the gov­ern­ment is set to de­lay the bud­get vote from tomorrow to next Tues­day, as two of its MPs from Sabah were sup­posed to be un­der quar­an­tine be­yond tomorrow, al­though Keningau rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jef­frey Kitin­gan has pur­port­edly gained spe­cial dis­pen­sa­tion from the Health Min­istry to end his iso­la­tion early.</p>
    <p>Al­though these Umno rene­gades pub­licly ex­press is­sues with the bud­get, they rep­re­sent a large seg­ment of the party un­happy at be­ing side­lined from ma­jor de­ci­sion-mak­ing and po­si­tions of power, and are us­ing the cru­cial vote as lever­age against the premier.</p>
    <p>But the King has in­di­cated that elec­tions are not an op­tion un­til Malaysia’s worst wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions has ebbed. Last week, he as­sented to a lo­calised emer­gency in Batu Sapi in Sabah to de­lay in­def­i­nitely a by-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Given the grow­ing frag­men­ta­tion of po­lit­i­cal al­liances, there is ev­ery chance that no one will con­trol</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment if Bud­get 2021 is de­feated, bring­ing back the pos­si­bil­ity of a na­tional emer­gency with Tan Sri Muhyid­din still at the helm.</p>
    <p>Umno re­mains di­vided over whether to con­tinue sup­port­ing Mr Muhyid­din, pres­i­dent of Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, or his PKR coun­ter­part An­war.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures be­ing cir­cu­lated claim that about two dozen Umno MPs back Mr An­war – roughly sim­i­lar to the pur­ported num­ber of Muhyid­din loy­al­ists, in­di­cat­ing that al­liances are still shift­ing at the 11th hour.</p>
    <p>Al­though the op­po­si­tion bench has 108 MPs, only 91 are in Mr An­war’s Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion. Mr An­war, who was granted an au­di­ence with the King last month to present his claim of a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity”, counted on a dec­la­ra­tion by Mr Zahid and his pre­de­ces­sor Na­jib that Umno would sup­port him as premier.</p>
    <p>His bid ul­ti­mately failed as Umno and PH’s largest com­po­nent, the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), could not agree to set aside more than half a cen­tury of en­mity.</p>
    <p>DAP, which has 42 MPs, in­sisted it would not work with a party led by scan­dal-hit Zahid or Na­jib, who are both ac­cused of graft.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war is try­ing to ap­pease DAP by say­ing Zahid and Na­jib will not be part of the new gov­ern­ment – even though the duo are clearly the ring­leaders of PN’s break­away fac­tion – as it would be an ar­range­ment only with in­di­vid­ual Umno MPs, PKR of­fi­cials told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“This puts us in a bind,” a se­nior DAP MP said. “On the one hand, we’d have to ex­plain to the pub­lic why we are will­ing to work with Umno MPs. On the other, why we are not back­ing An­war, as we’ve said we would for more than a decade.”</p>
