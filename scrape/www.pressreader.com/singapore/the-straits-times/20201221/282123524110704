    <p>By bring­ing in chil­dren through aca­demic pro­grammes, Progress Class So­ci­ety hopes to also es­tab­lish a men­tor­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween the chil­dren and the vol­un­teers to equip them with life skills.</p>
    <p>The ground-up ini­tia­tive in Mar­sil­ing, which tar­gets chil­dren and youth from low-in­come fam­i­lies in the area, was started in 2015 by a group of five young peo­ple. It now has a net­work of about 100 vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Mr Akram Hanif, 24, one of the co-founders, said the group started with the in­ten­tion of bridg­ing learn­ing gaps through a free tu­ition pro­gramme for pri­mary school pupils.</p>
    <p>Over the years, this has evolved to also cover so­cio-emo­tional skills and life skills, to bet­ter pre­pare the chil­dren and youth for life and op­por­tu­ni­ties, said Mr Akram.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive now has a tu­ition pro­gramme for sec­ondary school</p>
    <p>stu­dents and an en­rich­ment pro­gramme for them to pick up ad­di­tional skills.</p>
    <p>“We started it be­cause when our</p>
    <p>first batch of pri­mary school chil­dren were grad­u­at­ing, they asked if there was any­thing for them at sec­ondary level,” said Mr Akram.</p>
    <p>“We de­cided to do so be­cause sec­ondary school is a dif­fer­ent ball game. I my­self, in my sec­ondary school days, was an odd kid and found it dif­fi­cult to in­te­grate and needed sup­port,” he said.</p>
    <p>Beyond aca­demic help, the vol­un­teers are fo­cused on be­ing men­tors to the chil­dren, said Mr Akram.</p>
    <p>The pro­grammes now help close to 200 chil­dren across pri­mary and sec­ondary lev­els.</p>
    <p>Next year, the group plans to roll out a pro­gramme tar­geted at par­ents, to equip them with pos­i­tive par­ent­ing styles and a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of how to sup­port their chil­dren, said Mr Akram. They will also be linked up with rel­e­vant agen­cies in Mar­sil­ing for sup­port if nec­es­sary, he added.</p>
    <p>The group hopes to en­gage 120 par­ents a week through this pro­gramme. “By mak­ing this a key fo­cus for 2021, we want par­ents to un­der­stand that a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment is im­por­tant for the child,” said Mr Akram.</p>
    <p>The weekly pro­grammes for the chil­dren and youth went on­line this year amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, but Progress Class So­ci­ety hopes to re­turn to its usual ac­tiv­i­ties next year and help more chil­dren.</p>
    <p>This month, the group also started an on­line fund-rais­ing cam­paign on the Give.asia plat­form. It hopes to use the funds to hire full­timers and boost the par­ent­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“We want to ul­ti­mately be a place where we can see up­ward so­cial mo­bil­ity for our ben­e­fi­cia­ries and a pos­i­tive sys­tem for them to move ahead,” said Mr Akram.</p>
