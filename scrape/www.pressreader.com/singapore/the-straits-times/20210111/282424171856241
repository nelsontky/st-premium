    <p>LOS ANGELES • The Los Angeles Lak­ers with­out All-Star big man An­thony Davis are a dif­fer­ent out­fit al­to­gether, but a ca­pa­ble team none­the­less and ros­ter man­age­ment will shape their sea­son.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day against the Chicago Bulls, the Lak­ers squeezed out a 117-115 Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) home vic­tory with Davis sidelined by a right ad­duc­tor strain.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers cer­tainly have the depth to com­pete when their front-line starter is un­avail­able, but the chal­lenge re­mains keep­ing those ex­pected to fill the void en­gaged when ev­ery­one is healthy.</p>
    <p>Marki­eff Mor­ris posted 11 points, six re­bounds and a blocked shot in place of Davis against the Bulls and is a vi­able op­tion to do so again should he be needed against the Rock­ets this morn­ing (Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>“With Keef, it was man­ag­ing the ros­ter,” Lak­ers coach Frank Vogel said of his de­ci­sion to in­sert Mor­ris into the start­ing line-up.</p>
    <p>“He’s been a lit­tle bit short­changed with min­utes and hasn’t re­ally had a chance to blow it out and get some big run.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, he was a huge con­trib­u­tor for us last year in a cham­pi­onship run. With AD (Davis) out, it was an op­por­tu­nity to get him some ex­tended min­utes be­cause he’s some­one we be­lieve in and he had a great per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>De­spite what could be de­scribed as an un­even start to their sea­son, the Lak­ers (7-3) have won 70 per cent of their games and sit atop the Western Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>There were ex­pec­ta­tions that the NBA cham­pi­ons would be a jug­ger­naut given that the front of­fice strength­ened what was al­ready a ti­tle-win­ning ros­ter, but the Lak­ers thus far have been just good enough to be very good, yet not quite great.</p>
    <p>Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player Le</p>
    <p>Bron James is not wor­ried this early into the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Through the first 10 games I think we’ve played B, B-plus basketball and that is ab­so­lutely OK,” the All-Star for­ward said.</p>
    <p>“We are a team that added ba­si­cally five new pieces to the ro­ta­tion, and we’re still learn­ing from each other and get­ting ac­cus­tomed to dif­fer­ent line-ups and play­ing with dif­fer­ent guys.</p>
    <p>“But I think through the first 10 games, we’ve played pretty good basketball. We want to be bet­ter. That (grade) lets me know we have room to im­prove, and that’s a bright spot.”</p>
    <p>The Rock­ets (3-4) are still not whole them­selves, but their 132-90 win over the Magic last Fri­day rep­re­sented a step in the right di­rec­tion, even with Or­lando miss­ing a hand­ful of vi­tal ro­ta­tion play­ers.</p>
    <p>Hous­ton will be with­out Danuel House Jr here but are con­tin­u­ing to de­velop as a col­lec­tive unit after a Covid-hit start to their sea­son.</p>
    <p>Their next chal­lenge comes in fac­ing the Lak­ers twice in three days and with last sea­son’s 4-1 loss in the semi-fi­nals of the West playoffs still fresh, All-Star James Har­den knows that the hosts will be pushed to their lim­its.</p>
    <p>“Your mental fo­cus has got to be at an­other level,” the NBA’s scor­ing cham­pion for the past three sea­sons said. “It’s very dif­fi­cult to beat a team two times in a row, es­pe­cially back-to-back like that.”</p>
    <p>8-3</p>
