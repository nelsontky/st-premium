    <p>As the Covid-19 pan­demic drags on and coun­tries around the world con­sider scal­ing back govern­ment aid, the Jobs Sup­port Scheme will be fine-tuned so that it can con­tinue pro­tect­ing liveli­hoods, while re­main­ing fis­cally sus­tain­able. In to­tal, $8 bil­lion more will be spent, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>As the Covid-19 pan­demic drags on and the im­pact on busi­nesses and jobs mounts, sup­port for em­ploy­ers to pay the wages of their work­ers will be ex­tended and be­come more tar­geted.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, $8 bil­lion more will be spent to save jobs, cre­ate new ones, and seize new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Finance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>In a min­is­te­rial state­ment broad­cast yes­ter­day, Mr Heng said that the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), which com­prises wage sub­si­dies to help firms re­tain lo­cal work­ers, is end­ing soon and can­not be sus­tained at the cur­rent level.</p>
    <p>“It draws heav­ily on our re­serves and risks trap­ping our work­ers in un­vi­able busi­nesses. Some sec­tors are also re­cov­er­ing faster than oth­ers,” ex­plained Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>While the JSS, which cov­ers wages up to this month, will now be ex­tended to cover wages paid up to March next year, the sup­port is tiered based on how quickly each sec­tor is ex­pected to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Firms in the hard­est-hit aero­space, avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors, which are cur­rently get­ting 75 per cent wage sup­port, will get 50 per cent wage sup­port for seven more months.</p>
    <p>The built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor will get 50 per cent sup­port for two more months, be­fore it is low­ered to 30 per cent of wages paid up to March next year, in line with the phased re­sump­tion of con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties. Most other sec­tors will get 10 per cent sup­port for seven more months.</p>
    <p>Those that are do­ing well, such as bio­med­i­cal sciences, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, and in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy, will get this amount of sup­port up to De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Even at 10 per cent sup­port, the pay­outs cover more than half of em­ploy­ers’ Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions. This en­sures that we con­tinue to build up the CPF sav­ings of our work­ers dur­ing the cri­sis,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, which was in­tro­duced in May to help Sin­ga­pore­ans who have been laid off or have suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss, will be ex­tended to De­cem­ber. To qual­ify, un­em­ployed ap­pli­cants must demon­strate job search or train­ing ef­forts. The ap­pli­ca­tion win­dow, which was slated to end next month, will now re­open on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>More lower-in­come work­ers – in­clud­ing those who have re­ceived or will be re­ceiv­ing Work­fare for work done this year – stand to re­ceive the $3,000 cash pay­out un­der the Work­fare Spe­cial Payment.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures an­nounced yes­ter­day come on top of the nearly $100 bil­lion com­mit­ted un­der the four Budgets this year.</p>
    <p>They will be funded by the re­al­lo­ca­tion of monies from other ar­eas, such as devel­op­ment ex­pen­di­tures that were de­layed due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There are no plans to draw on past re­serves be­yond the $52 bil­lion for which Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s ap­proval was ob­tained ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The sup­port has been ex­tended amid a deep­en­ing re­ces­sion, with gross do­mes­tic prod­uct shrink­ing by 6.7 per cent in the first half of the year. In the sec­ond quar­ter, the econ­omy con­tracted by 13.2 per cent year on year, the worst on record.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments more than dou­bled in the sec­ond quar­ter, with 6,700 work­ers laid off, up from 3,220 in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While no one knows what the post-Covid-19 world will look like, it will not be busi­ness as usual, given the in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of the com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the United States and China, the re­con­fig­u­ra­tion of global sup­ply chains and the ac­cel­er­a­tion of digital shifts, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that it will be a dif­fi­cult jour­ney ahead, but as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans, whom he called “one peo­ple with ex­tra­or­di­nary courage, com­mit­ment and can-do spirit”, that they will not walk alone.</p>
    <p>“We have the for­ti­tude – to im­pro­vise, adapt and over­come the un­cer­tain­ties. We have the re­silience – to weather the dif­fi­cul­ties, turn chal­lenges into op­por­tu­ni­ties and pre­pare for the fu­ture,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And we will stand in sol­i­dar­ity as one united Sin­ga­pore – to beat this cri­sis and emerge stronger as a na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) will be ex­tended by up to seven months, to help em­ploy­ers to re­tain their lo­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>The sub­si­dies will now cover wages paid up to March next year for firms in sec­tors harder-hit by the Covid-19 cri­sis, and up to De­cem­ber this year for sec­tors which are man­ag­ing well, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>The sup­port – which will range from 10 per cent to 50 per cent for wages paid from Septem­ber on­wards – will be ad­justed based on the pro­jected re­cov­ery of the dif­fer­ent sec­tors, said Mr Heng yes­ter­day in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on how the Govern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port busi­nesses and work­ers.</p>
    <p>“We can­not sus­tain the JSS at cur­rent lev­els,” he said. “It draws heav­ily on our re­serves and risks trap­ping our work­ers in un­vi­able busi­nesses. Some sec­tors are also re­cov­er­ing faster than oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>The sub­sidy ap­plies to the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each Sin­ga­porean or per­ma­nent res­i­dent em­ployee.</p>
    <p>Firms in the aero­space, avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors will re­ceive 50 per cent of wages paid from Septem­ber un­til March.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses such as karaoke lounges and pubs that have not been al­lowed to re­sume on-site op­er­a­tions will re­ceive the high­est level of wage sup­port – 50 per cent – un­til they can re­sume work or un­til March, which­ever is ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Those in the built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor will re­ceive 50 per cent of wages paid next month and in Oc­to­ber, and then 30 per cent of wages paid un­til March, as con­struc­tion ac­tiv­ity re­sumes in phases.</p>
    <p>The arts and en­ter­tain­ment, food ser­vices, land trans­port, ma­rine and off­shore, and re­tail sec­tors will re­ceive 30 per cent of wages paid un­til March.</p>
    <p>Sec­tors man­ag­ing well – bio­med­i­cal sciences, pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing, elec­tron­ics, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy and me­dia, on­line re­tail and su­per­mar­kets – will re­ceive 10 per cent of wages paid un­til De­cem­ber this year.</p>
    <p>Other firms will re­ceive 10 per cent of wages paid un­til March.</p>
    <p>The scheme, which was in­tro­duced in the Bud­get state­ment in Fe­bru­ary and en­hanced sub­se­quently, has sub­sidised be­tween 25 per cent and 75 per cent of wages paid for 10 months.</p>
    <p>It was to cover wages paid un­til this month, with the fi­nal pay­out in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>There will now be ad­di­tional pay­outs in March and June next year for rel­e­vant firms.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “I urge all busi­nesses to make full use of this ad­di­tional sup­port to re­tain and up­skill your work­ers, and to trans­form your op­er­a­tions for the post­Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>“This will en­able you to spring back faster when the re­cov­ery comes.”</p>
    <p>The lat­est JSS en­hance­ment comes af­ter calls from peo­ple, in­clud­ing busi­ness lead­ers and economists, to ex­tend the sup­port in or­der to pro­tect jobs as the im­pact of the pan­demic drags on.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng yes­ter­day said more than $16 bil­lion of the $23.5 bil­lion al­lo­cated for the scheme has been dis­bursed so far, ben­e­fit­ing over two mil­lion lo­cal work­ers in more than 150,000 firms.</p>
    <p>While the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate has risen from 3.3 per cent in March to an es­ti­mated 3.9 per cent in June, it is still be­low the peak lev­els seen dur­ing the Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) out­break and global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, he noted.</p>
    <p>Even at 10 per cent sup­port, the wage sub­si­dies still cover more than half of em­ploy­ers’ Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions for work­ers, he said.</p>
    <p>“This en­sures that we con­tinue to build up the CPF sav­ings of our work­ers dur­ing the cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>Nearly 600 com­pa­nies have also re­turned or do­nated their JSS pay­outs, he added, thank­ing these firms for their sense of com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>He urged firms that are cop­ing well to do like­wise.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers can re­fer to the In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s JSS web­site (https://go.gov.sg/jss) for more details on the com­pu­ta­tion and payment sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses can also tap other ex­ist­ing schemes such as the en­hanced En­ter­prise Fi­nanc­ing Scheme and Tem­po­rary Bridg­ing Loan Pro­gramme, which aim to pro­vide firms with access to credit and fi­nanc­ing for cash­flow needs.</p>
    <p>These are avail­able un­til March next year.</p>
