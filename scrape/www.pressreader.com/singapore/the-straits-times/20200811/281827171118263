    <p>LONDON • Se­nior Bri­tish of­fi­cers in the Hong Kong po­lice force could face le­gal ac­tion in Bri­tain on tor­ture charges af­ter ac­tivists yes­ter­day said they planned to pro­ceed with a pri­vate pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>The ex­pa­tri­ate of­fi­cers are ac­cused of di­rectly en­gag­ing in tor­ture against pro-democ­racy demon­stra­tors, or di­rect­ing oth­ers within the force to carry out the crimes.</p>
    <p>Tor­ture has al­legedly been car­ried out in po­lice sta­tions and on the streets, with a spe­cific in­ci­dent cited at Hong Kong’s Citic Tower dur­ing protests in June last year.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion is be­ing brought by a team of prom­i­nent ac­tivists and lawyers, who are try­ing to raise £200,000 (S$359,000) to em­ploy a full-time le­gal team.</p>
    <p>They say the pros­e­cu­tion can be car­ried out in London as tor­ture is an of­fence which has universal ju­ris­dic­tion un­der Bri­tish law.</p>
    <p>“The peo­ple of Hong Kong have suf­fered sus­tained bru­tal­ity at the hands of the Hong Kong Po­lice Force,” said Mr Luke de Pul­ford, a mem­ber of the hu­man rights group, Hong Kong Watch.</p>
    <p>“De­spite clear ev­i­dence of ex­ces­sive force, no of­fi­cer has been dis­ci­plined. Many of those of­fi­cers are Bri­tish, and as such, they are sub­ject to Bri­tish law.”</p>
    <p>None of the of­fi­cers has been named.</p>
    <p>The group bring­ing the pros­e­cu­tion claims three of the six Hong Kong re­gional com­man­der po­lice posts are filled by Bri­tish na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>“This is a very im­por­tant ini­tia­tive be­cause this is one of the very few ways we can hold the Hong Kong po­lice ac­count­able,” said democ­racy ac­tivist Nathan Law, who re­cently fled to London from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Un­der Bri­tish law, the ac­tivists will have to get per­mis­sion from the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral, the chief le­gal ad­viser to the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment, to pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>The group says it has the back­ing of sev­eral mem­bers of the Bri­tish Par­lia­ment, which could place a fur­ther strain on re­la­tions be­tween London and Bei­jing.</p>
