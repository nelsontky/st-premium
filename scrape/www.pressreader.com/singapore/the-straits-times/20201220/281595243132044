    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia surged past 10 mil­lion Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, of­fi­cial data showed, the sec­ond­high­est in the world, al­though new in­fec­tion rates ap­pear to have fallen sharply in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases in­creased by just over 25,000 in 24 hours, ac­cord­ing to the health min­istry, while the to­tal num­ber of deaths from the virus in In­dia now stands at 145,136.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the vast na­tion of 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple had been record­ing daily new cases of al­most 100,000 and looked on track to sur­pass the United States as the worst-hit coun­try.</p>
    <p>But the out­break has ac­cel­er­ated in the US and ap­pears to have lost mo­men­tum in In­dia, de­spite the coun­try be­ing home to some of the most crowded ci­ties on the planet.</p>
    <p>The United States, with a pop­u­la­tion a quar­ter the size of In­dia’s, has been re­port­ing up­wards of 200,000 new cases daily in re­cent weeks, 10 times as many as In­dia.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s fa­tal­ity rate is also con­sid­er­ably lower – less than half that of the US.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents in the cap­i­tal New Delhi told Agence France-Presse news agency that they were still wor­ried but were more com­fort­able than be­fore about leav­ing their homes.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, the fear lev­els have come down over time. Ini­tially, it was more scary,” said house­wife Huma Zaidi, 46.</p>
    <p>“But we are still tak­ing pre­cau­tions, like wear­ing masks when go­ing out and avoid­ing social gath­er­ings.” In­dia has lifted re­stric­tions on most ac­tiv­i­ties to boost the strug­gling econ­omy, al­though some states and ter­ri­to­ries have reim­posed curbs.</p>
    <p>“I plucked up my courage and went out for lunch for the first time in six or eight months,” said lan­guage in­struc­tor Simpy Dhar, 44.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, my fear is not elim­i­nated com­pletely. I know coro­n­avirus is still out there.”</p>
