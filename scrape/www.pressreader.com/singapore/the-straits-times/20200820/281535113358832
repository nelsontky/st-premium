    <p>About 200 Thai right-wingers have launched a group to counter stu­dent-led protests that have called for the de­par­ture of the govern­ment and re­form of the monar­chy. Mean­while, a Thai court has is­sued ar­rest war­rants for six pro-democ­racy ac­tivists in­volved in the re­cent ral­lies. WORLD</p>
    <p>BANGKOK • About 200 Thai rightwinge­rs launched a group yes­ter­day to counter stu­dent-led protests that have taken place al­most daily since mid-July to de­mand the de­par­ture of the govern­ment, with some seek­ing re­form of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>While anti-govern­ment pro­test­ers drew over 10,000 peo­ple to the big­gest demon­stra­tion in years on Sun­day, counter-protests by loy­al­ists drew at most a few dozen peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The “Thai Pakdee” (Loyal Thai) group was launched at a Bangkok ho­tel by prom­i­nent right-wing politi­cian Warong Dechgitvi­grom, who said King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s monar­chy was un­der at­tack. “The fa­ther of the coun­try is be­ing ha­rassed... How can Thai peo­ple stand by?” he told Reuters. “Our fight must be on­line and off­line.”</p>
    <p>He said the group was non-vi­o­lent and had not set any dates for protests or other ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­turn of protests to Bangkok streets has sparked fears of a re­turn to more than a decade of colour­coded clashes be­tween estab­lish­ment sup­port­ers and their pop­ulist­back­ing op­po­nents be­fore a 2014 coup in which Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha took power. Thais also re­call vi­o­lence in 1976, when stu­dent protests were crushed after be­ing ac­cused of dis­loy­alty to the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Anti-govern­ment pro­test­ers seek Mr Prayut’s de­par­ture and dis­so­lu­tion of Par­lia­ment, a new con­sti­tu­tion and an end to the ha­rass­ment of ac­tivists. They say elec­tions that kept Mr Prayut in power last year were ma­nip­u­lated. He says they were fair. Thai Pakdee set three de­mands: No dis­so­lu­tion of Par­lia­ment, max­i­mum le­gal ac­tion against any­one seek­ing to top­ple the monar­chy, and no change to the Con­sti­tu­tion ex­cept via proper chan­nels.</p>
    <p>A Thai court is­sued ar­rest war­rants yes­ter­day for six pro-democ­racy ac­tivists in­volved in re­cent ral­lies. The demon­stra­tions have been largely tol­er­ated so far, but po­lice said yes­ter­day they now had war­rants to ar­rest half a dozen of the most prom­i­nent pro­test­ers, who will be charged with “sedi­tion, (vi­o­la­tion of the) com­puter crimes act, vi­o­lat­ing the dis­eases con­trol act and us­ing loud­speak­ers”.</p>
    <p>While the use of puni­tive lese ma­jeste laws has slowed, ob­servers say the govern­ment has stepped up other le­gal mech­a­nisms to tar­get dis­sent – in­clud­ing us­ing sedi­tion and com­puter crime leg­is­la­tion. Two of the war­rants is­sued yes­ter­day are for pro­test­ers pre­vi­ously ar­rested and bailed – hu­man rights lawyer Anon Numpa and stu­dent leader Panupong Jad­nok – who now face new charges linked to an Aug 10 rally at Tham­masat Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>The move­ment has spread to high schools, where stu­dents tie a white bow in their hair in sol­i­dar­ity with the pro-democ­racy cause. Hun­dreds ral­lied at the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry yes­ter­day, chant­ing “di­nosaur” and boo­ing the min­is­ter for what crit­ics say is a rigid, an­ti­quated ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem.</p>
