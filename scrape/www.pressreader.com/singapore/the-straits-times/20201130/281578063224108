    <p>Travel re­stric­tions and ad­di­tional work as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus mean many Sin­ga­pore­ans have not been able to clear their leave this year. An em­ployer has come up with a novel way of mak­ing use of un­used leave – let­ting staff con­vert it into cash do­na­tions for char­ity – but ques­tions have been raised over whether this is a good idea.</p>
    <p>Travel re­stric­tions and ad­di­tional work as a re­sult of the coro­n­avirus mean many Sin­ga­pore­ans have not been able to clear their leave this year, although ex­perts have en­cour­aged work­ers to take breaks for their men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, civil ser­vants and pub­lic health­care work­ers were given a longer pe­riod to clear their out­stand­ing leave and the op­tion to en­cash part of it.</p>
    <p>An­other em­ployer has come up with a novel way of mak­ing use of un­used leave — let­ting staff con­vert it into cash do­na­tions for char­ity. Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity an­nounced last week that its fac­ulty and staff have do­nated more than $10 mil­lion of their un­used leave to sup­port its stu­dents.</p>
    <p>This ap­proach has not yet taken hold here, but ques­tions have been raised over whether it is a good idea for em­ploy­ees and if com­pa­nies can af­ford leave do­na­tion schemes.</p>
    <p>Labour econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira said many firms no longer per­mit leave en­cash­ment, and hav­ing a leave do­na­tion scheme will re­sult in ex­tra ex­pen­di­ture for busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Associatio­n of Small and Medium En­ter­prises pres­i­dent Kurt Wee added: “I sus­pect in these chal­leng­ing eco­nomic times, few com­pa­nies will im­ple­ment such schemes, es­pe­cially smaller ones which are fac­ing large cash flow prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>As for em­ploy­ees, there are wor­ries that em­ploy­ers giv­ing them the op­tion to do­nate leave to char­ity, or hold­ing up firms that do, could pres­sure peo­ple to do so in a man­ner detri­men­tal to work­ers.</p>
    <p>Prof Th­e­seira said if im­ple­mented, leave do­na­tion schemes need to be rolled out with cau­tion to avoid en­croach­ing on leave en­ti­tle­ments of lower-wage work­ers.</p>
    <p>“These work­ers may have very lit­tle leave en­ti­tle­ment and also face a lack of flex­i­bil­ity at work, and the pres­ence of such schemes may en­croach on those who need leave to at­tend to fam­ily or per­sonal mat­ters,” he said.</p>
    <p>What do work­ers think?</p>
    <p>A Straits Times on­line sur­vey of 474 peo­ple from last Thurs­day to Satur­day found slightly over half the re­spon­dents wanted their em­ploy­ers to al­low them to do­nate un­used leave. While 81 per cent said they have un­used leave, 55 per cent said they would sup­port do­nat­ing some of their days to char­ity.</p>
    <p>Those who were keen on leave do­na­tion said they would pre­fer to do­nate to char­ity in­stead of be­ing forced to clear days ow­ing or to avoid hav­ing them for­feited.</p>
    <p>They did ac­knowl­edge that char­i­ties may be in greater need of do­na­tions dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some of those who pre­ferred not to do­nate their leave said they would rather spend time with their loved ones or be al­lowed to en­cash their days owed.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers felt there were bet­ter ways to give to char­ity.</p>
    <p>They un­der­lined that peo­ple need to rest not just for pro­duc­tiv­ity but also for their health, and us­ing up their leave helps en­sure this.</p>
    <p>Some were con­cerned that al­low­ing leave to be con­verted could en­cour­age poor work­place cul­ture to be per­pet­u­ated, in­clud­ing con­tin­u­ing to work while on leave.</p>
    <p>The range of views on the idea could ex­plain why only a hand­ful of or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), said schemes for staff to do­nate un­used leave are in the works. Many pre­fer to urge em­ploy­ees to help the community in other ways.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered Bank started a vol­un­teer leave scheme about 10 years ago that gives each em­ployee three days a year to vol­un­teer for causes they care about.</p>
    <p>StanChart, which said its staff vol­un­teer about 4,000 days a year, gave em­ploy­ees an ex­tra day of vol­un­teer­ing leave this year to “sup­port our community through the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>For Ms Ce­les Kweng, the bank’s busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion and of­fice man­ager of group prop­erty, one of the most mem­o­rable vol­un­teer­ing ex­pe­ri­ences was with 80 of her col­leagues at char­ity Will­ing Hearts soup kitchen. Se­nior ex­ec­u­tives washed raw fish while oth­ers fried eggs, and this helped build ca­ma­raderie, she re­called.</p>
    <p>At OCBC Bank, em­ploy­ees can carry for­ward up to 12 days of an­nual leave to next year in­stead of the usual seven, or choose to en­cash up to five days.</p>
    <p>Mr Ernest Phang, OCBC head of cor­po­rate ser­vices, group hu­man re­sources, said: “While we con­tinue to strongly en­cour­age our em­ploy­ees to take their an­nual leave... we also recog­nise that this is an ex­cep­tional year due to Covid-19 and there­fore our em­ploy­ees would ap­pre­ci­ate more flex­i­bil­ity with their leave plans.”</p>
    <p>Hu­man re­source ex­perts said that while leave do­na­tion re­mains un­com­mon in Sin­ga­pore, it might be a convenient way for em­ploy­ees to do good.</p>
    <p>Ms Linda Teo, coun­try man­ager at re­cruit­ment agency Man­pow­erGroup Sin­ga­pore, said do­nat­ing leave is “an easy way for staff to do some­thing mean­ing­ful and con­trib­ute to char­ity as the do­na­tion comes from their en­ti­tle­ment”.</p>
    <p>She said leave do­na­tion can help to boost em­ployee morale and an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s cor­po­rate im­age.</p>
    <p>Dr Zhang Weina, a se­nior lec­turer in fi­nance at NUS Busi­ness School, said all forms of giv­ing should be en­cour­aged, not just leave do­na­tion. For in­stance, 1,600 staff from Sin­ga­pore’s five poly­tech­nics do­nated a com­bined $417,000 of their Sol­i­dar­ity Pay­ments – $600 for each cit­i­zen – to sup­port about 635 needy stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers’ Fed­er­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Sim Gim Guan lauded the do­na­tions made by NTU’s fac­ulty and staff.</p>
    <p>He said: “The fed­er­a­tion en­cour­ages em­ploy­ers to con­tinue to do good to­gether with their em­ploy­ees so that both their busi­ness and the community can do well to­gether.”</p>
