    <p>TOKYO • As the race hots up within the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) to choose a suc­ces­sor for Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, yet an­other round of mu­si­cal chairs has oc­curred in the op­po­si­tion camp.</p>
    <p>But cov­er­age of the op­po­si­tion merger in do­mes­tic me­dia has been dwarfed by the LDP, with crit­i­cisms that the op­po­si­tion switcheroo is but “pour­ing old wine into a new bot­tle”.</p>
    <p>“The only way it can si­lence the crit­i­cism is by of­fer­ing strong and con­crete pol­icy pro­pos­als,” said the Asahi Shim­bun in an ed­i­to­rial.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s top op­po­si­tion Con­sti­tu­tional Demo­cratic Party of Ja­pan (CDP) for­mally “merged” with the Demo­cratic Party for the Peo­ple (DPP) last Thurs­day, to form a new party with 149 law­mak­ers from both houses of the Diet – com­pris­ing 88 CDP mem­bers, 40 DPP mem­bers and 21 in­de­pen­dents.</p>
    <p>While they voted for their leader and party name, it even­tu­ally turned out to be more of an ab­sorp­tion than a merger. The new party keeps the name CDP. It also has the same leader Yukio Edano, 56, who de­feated DPP pol­icy chief Kenta Izumi, 46.</p>
    <p>Mr Edano urged the new prime min­is­ter to con­vene Par­lia­ment for de­bate. But, al­lud­ing to spec­u­la­tion that a snap elec­tion might be in the off­ing as early as next month, he said: “If for their own self­ish rea­sons they run away from a full-fledged de­bate in the Diet and call a snap elec­tion, we will face them head on and give the peo­ple a choice.”</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers in the new party in­clude for­mer prime min­is­ters Naoto Kan, who ruled from June 2010 to Septem­ber 2011, and his suc­ces­sor Yoshi­hiko Noda, who ruled un­til De­cem­ber 2012. It also in­cludes veteran politi­cian Ichiro Ozawa, LDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral from 1989 to 1991 be­fore join­ing the op­po­si­tion in 1993.</p>
    <p>The trio were part of what was then known as the Demo­cratic Party of Ja­pan (DPJ), which briefly seized power from the LDP be­tween 2009 and 2012. But it was un­cer­e­mo­ni­ously ousted for its woe­ful man­age­ment of such crises as the fall­out of the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis and the earthquake, tsunami and nu­clear disas­ter on March 11, 2011.</p>
    <p>The Asahi’s ed­i­to­rial said the merged party “is in many ways a re­gath­er­ing of var­i­ous el­e­ments of the DPJ”. The Mainichi said: “It is likely dif­fi­cult to wipe away the im­pres­sion that the now-de­funct DPJ, which failed in its man­age­ment of the ad­min­is­tra­tion, is sim­ply get­ting back to­gether.”</p>
    <p>SPLIN­TERED HIS­TORY</p>
    <p>In­deed, con­sider the al­pha­bet soup of the Ja­panese op­po­si­tion scene. Strug­gling to cap­ture sup­port, the DPJ dis­banded in 2016, merg­ing with the Ja­pan In­no­va­tion Party to form the Demo­cratic Party (DP).</p>
    <p>But the DP lasted only barely a year be­fore it splin­tered into three groups ahead of a 2017 snap elec­tion: the CDP, the Party of Hope (founded by Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike and more com­monly known as the Kibo no To), and rem­nants of the DP.</p>
    <p>The CDP emerged as the main op­po­si­tion with just 55 seats in the 465-mem­ber Lower House, and Mr Edano be­came the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the DP merged with the Party of Hope to form the DPP – which last week again merged with the CDP to form... the “new” party called CDP.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery one in the DPP joined the new party, given ir­rec­on­cil­able dif­fer­ences on pol­icy is­sues. DPP leader Yuichiro Ta­maki now leads a splin­ter group of 14 law­mak­ers, who dis­agree with the CDP’s “zero nu­clear” pol­icy. They are also more amenable – and in line with Mr Abe than the CDP – to­wards the idea of re­vis­ing the paci­fist Con­sti­tu­tion for the first time since its en­act­ment in 1947. Th­ese mu­si­cal chairs are among mod­er­ate and cen­tre-left par­ties, and ex­clude smaller par­ties like the far-left Ja­panese Com­mu­nist Party, or the pop­ulist Reiwa Shin­sen­gumi.</p>
    <p>Still, the 149 law­mak­ers in the ex­panded CDP will face a for­mi­da­ble chal­lenge against the rul­ing LDP’s 394 law­mak­ers in the Diet.</p>
    <p>The im­pend­ing exit of Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, who re­signed over health rea­sons, has given his gov­ern­ment an un­prece­dented surge in sup­port among vot­ers who rate highly the sta­bil­ity he has brought over seven years and nine months as Ja­pan’s leader.</p>
    <p>In a survey by Kyodo News last week, 48.1 per cent said they plan to vote for the LDP in the next Lower House elec­tion, while 15.7 per cent said they would vote for the new op­po­si­tion party – higher than the 4 per cent who said they would vote for the op­po­si­tion in a pre­vi­ous poll be­fore the merger.</p>
    <p>The Asahi ed­i­to­rial said that among Mr Edano’s key tasks as leader of the ex­panded party are to “erase the pub­lic’s im­age of the bick­er­ing and in­ef­fec­tual DPJ that fell from power in 2012” and to “of­fer a clearly dif­fer­ent al­ter­na­tive”.</p>
    <p>It noted that the splin­tered op­po­si­tion camp has con­trib­uted to Mr Abe’s and the LDP’s dom­i­nance in power, but warned: “With both its name and leader un­changed from the old CDP, the new party does not strike vot­ers as a re­ally fresh po­lit­i­cal force.”</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri daily con­curred that it was “hard to say that there is a grow­ing sense of ex­cite­ment” over the for­ma­tion of the new party. “It is dif­fi­cult for vot­ers to un­der­stand the dif­fer­ence be­tween the con­ven­tional CDP and the new party, and they ap­par­ently see the merger of two op­po­si­tion par­ties as only ‘jug­gling num­bers’ to make up enough law­mak­ers for greater strength,” it said.</p>
    <p>Still, Dr Yu Uchiyama of the Univer­sity of Tokyo, said: “If (the CDP) can present the vot­ing pub­lic with an ef­fec­tive choice other than the LDP, the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion could be­come much more fluid.”</p>
    <p>But Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano sus­pects the op­po­si­tion merger was only man­dated by cir­cum­stance. “It is nec­es­sary to grow in num­bers given the first-past-the-post sys­tem,” he tells In­sight. “If they re­main di­vided, they are al­most cer­tainly go­ing to lose.”</p>
