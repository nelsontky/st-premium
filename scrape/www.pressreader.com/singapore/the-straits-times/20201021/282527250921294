    <p>Jazz mu­si­cians who have seen a drop in their in­come lately can now get up to $1,800 each from The Jazz As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) (Jass).</p>
    <p>The new Jass Cri­sis Fund will give a one-time grant to l ocal j azz mu­si­cians whose earn­ings have been af­fected by crises such as the Covid-19 pan­demic or health is­sues which pre­vent them from work­ing.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants have un­til Nov 5 to ap­ply on­line at jaz­zas­so­ci­a­tion.sg/jass­cri­sis­fund. All ap­pli­ca­tions will be kept con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>The fund is avail­able only to Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who are at least 21 years old.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants must be based in Sin­ga­pore and mak­ing a liv­ing as pro­fes­sional jazz mu­si­cians for at least three con­sec­u­tive years.</p>
    <p>They must also have ex­pe­ri­enced a loss of 40 per cent or more in their monthly in­come for at least three con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>Full-time na­tional ser­vice­men are not el­i­gi­ble. Ap­pli­cants will be as­sessed by a panel made up of Jass board di­rec­tors. Th­ese in­clude jazz vet­eran and Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Jeremy Mon­teiro (above left); law firm Ad­san Law LLC’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Su­san Leong; and F&B com­pany Neo Group’s ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Sally Liew.</p>
    <p>The panel will look into cri­te­ria such as the per­sonal and house­hold needs of the ap­pli­cant, and his or her con­tri­bu­tions to the home-grown jazz scene.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Jass, the num­ber and amount of the grants given out will be sub­ject to the “avail­abil­ity of funds”.</p>
    <p>It may ex­tend the dead­line or re­open ap­pli­ca­tions if there are suf­fi­cient funds.</p>
    <p>Mon­teiro says that though mu­si­cians in ev­ery genre are suf­fer­ing sig­nif­i­cant losses in in­come amid the pan­demic, jazz mu­si­cians have been hit es­pe­cially hard be­cause they do not op­er­ate in the main­stream.</p>
    <p>“Some have adapted by do­ing live-stream and ses­sion work on­line and re­motely; some have started teach­ing on­line as well. But this rep­re­sents a small por­tion of their al­ready mod­est in­come and so many are def­i­nitely feel­ing the bite,” he says.</p>
