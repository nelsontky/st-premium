    <p>More than 1,400 Google em­ploy­ees have de­manded that the tech gi­ant ex­plain why it dis­missed a black ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence ethics re­searcher.</p>
    <p>Dr Timnit Ge­bru tweeted last week that Google told her a res­ig­na­tion she had not prof­fered was ac­cepted, af­ter she sent a mes­sage to an in­ter­nal group lament­ing the “si­lenc­ing of marginalis­ed voices”.</p>
    <p>She had also told the “Brain Women and Al­lies” group in the e-mail that she had been or­dered to re­tract a re­search pa­per.</p>
    <p>Dr Ge­bru is an out­spo­ken di­ver­sity ad­vo­cate and co-founder of a group de­voted to in­creas­ing black tal­ent in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI).</p>
    <p>Un­til last Tues­day, she was a staff re­searcher and co-lead of an eth­i­cal AI team at Google.</p>
    <p>Dr Ge­bru tweeted what she said was the dis­missal mes­sage from Google, which noted that “as­pects of the e-mail you sent last night to non-man­age­ment em­ploy­ees in the brain group re­flect be­hav­iour that is in­con­sis­tent with the ex­pec­ta­tions of a Google man­ager”.</p>
    <p>The re­search pa­per Dr Ge­bru was told to re­tract looked at po­ten­tial for an AI tool used by Google and other tech firms to im­i­tate hu­man writ­ing of hate speech and bi­ased lan­guage, said a re­port by Na­tional Pub­lic Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Slightly more than 1,400 Google em­ploy­ees were among the nearly 3,300 names on an on­line let­ter call­ing on the tech gi­ant to ex­plain Dr Ge­bru’s dis­missal, along with the rea­son for or­der­ing her to with­draw her re­search.</p>
    <p>The let­ter de­manded Google make an “un­equiv­o­cal” com­mit­ment to re­search in­tegrity and aca­demic free­dom.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of be­ing em­braced by Google as an ex­cep­tion­ally tal­ented and pro­lific con­trib­u­tor, Dr Ge­bru has faced de­fen­sive­ness, racism, gaslight­ing, re­search cen­sor­ship and, now, a re­tal­ia­tory fir­ing,” the let­ter con­tended.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a re­quest for com­ment, Google re­ferred Agence France-Presse to an e-mail by AI di­vi­sion leader Jeff Dean to re­searchers at the com­pany that he posted pub­licly on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Dean said in the e-mail that it was a “dif­fi­cult mo­ment” and he wanted to clear up what he saw as “a lot of spec­u­la­tion and mis­un­der­stand­ing on so­cial me­dia” about Dr Ge­bru’s de­par­ture from the firm.</p>
    <p>The re­search pa­per au­thored by</p>
    <p>Dr Ge­bru and other re­searchers was shared for re­view just a day be­fore a sub­mis­sion dead­line and “had some im­por­tant gaps that pre­vented us from be­ing com­fort­able putting Google af­fil­i­a­tion on it”, Mr Dean said in the e-mail.</p>
    <p>Dr Ge­bru re­sponded with con­di­tions – in­clud­ing that Google give her the names of ev­ery­one in­volved in re­view­ing the pa­per – say­ing she would leave if they were not met, Mr Dean con­tended.</p>
    <p>“We ac­cept and re­spect her de­ci­sion to re­sign from Google,” Mr Dean said in the e-mail.</p>
    <p>“Given Timnit’s role as a re­spected re­searcher and a man­ager in our eth­i­cal AI team, I feel badly that Timnit has got to a place where she feels this way about the work we’re do­ing.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ge­bru, who is Ethiopian Amer­i­can, earned en­gi­neer­ing de­grees and a doc­tor­ate from Stan­ford Univer­sity in Sil­i­con Val­ley. She has worked at Ap­ple and con­ducted re­search at Mi­crosoft.</p>
    <p>Her re­search has in­cluded show­ing the like­li­hood of fa­cial de­tec­tion tech­nol­ogy mak­ing mis­takes when iden­ti­fy­ing peo­ple of colour.</p>
    <p>Her dis­missal came just days af­ter a US labour board com­plaint ac­cused Google of us­ing sur­veil­lance, in­ter­ro­ga­tion and other tac­tics to spy on ac­tivist em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Labour Re­la­tions Board com­plaint stemmed from the dis­missal a year ago of a quar­tet of em­ploy­ees dubbed the “Thanks­giv­ing Four”.</p>
    <p>The work­ers sought a fed­eral in­ves­ti­ga­tion into their dis­missal, al­leg­ing they were sacked in re­tal­i­a­tion for their labour or­gan­is­ing ef­forts, while Google main­tained that the em­ploy­ees had vi­o­lated data se­cu­rity poli­cies.</p>
