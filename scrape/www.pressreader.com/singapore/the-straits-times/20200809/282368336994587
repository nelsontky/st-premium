    <p>When free­lance writer and dig­i­tal mar­keter Faz Gaffa-Marsh, 34, lost her fa­ther to lung cancer last year, grief sent her body and mind into a tail­spin.</p>
    <p>Her eczema flared up, her hair fell out and she had trou­ble sleep­ing. To make mat­ters worse, all this hap­pened as she was strug­gling to take care of her in­fant son and her grief­stricken mother. Her hus­band, Mr John Marsh, 44, is be­tween jobs.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing never gone for ther­apy, she puz­zled over the dif­fer­ence be­tween psy­chother­a­pists and coun­sel­lors, and strug­gled to find af­ford­able rates.</p>
    <p>Af­ter get­ting the help she needed from a nutri­tion­ist, fol­lowed by a coun­sel­lor, Ms Gaffa-Marsh wanted to spare oth­ers the stress she had gone through.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, she started online com­mu­nity My Safe Sphere, which aims to end the stigma against men­tal ail­ments through low-cost small-group ther­apy ses­sions.</p>
    <p>The plan was to hold quar­terly ses­sions, fa­cil­i­tated by men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als and cen­tred on a theme, such as grief.</p>
    <p>Ses­sions would be priced af­ford­ably at about $12 a per­son, with the money go­ing to­wards op­er­at­ing costs and char­ity.</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 struck and the group ses­sions never took off.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has, how­ever, re­vealed new men­tal health vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Since launch­ing My Safe Sphere, Ms Gaffa-Marsh has re­ceived a few In­sta­gram mes­sages every day from peo­ple look­ing for a lis­ten­ing ear.</p>
    <p>She has given ad­vice to job seek­ers and free­lancers on ap­ply­ing for gov­ern­ment grants, di­rected peo­ple to af­ford­able ther­apy ses­sions of­fered by the psy­chol­ogy clinic at James Cook Uni­ver­sity and given helpline num­bers to a woman fac­ing do­mes­tic vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Still, she is quick to point out that she is not a men­tal health pro­fes­sional – just a guide to those who are un­sure of their next step.</p>
    <p>“I see this as a pos­i­tive way of help­ing oth­ers, some­thing my fa­ther would have done too. He was char­i­ta­ble and a good per­son.</p>
    <p>“A lot of my grief was about not be­ing able to help my fa­ther when he had end-stage lung cancer, but I hope that in some lit­tle way, I can help these peo­ple in their lives,” she says.</p>
