    <p>TILL WE MEET AGAIN</p>
    <p>There is still much to be said, but for now, may God give strength to fam­ily mem­bers. One day, I hope we can play to­gether up in the sky.</p>
    <p>PELE, Brazil­ian leg­end and joint best player of the 20th cen­tury</p>
    <p>The pope was in­formed about the death of Diego Maradona, he re­calls the times he met him in these past years with af­fec­tion, and he is rememberin­g him in his prayers, as he did in the past days when he was in­formed about his con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>MAT­TEO BRUNI, Vat­i­can spokesman, on be­half of Pope Fran­cis</p>
    <p>SOME­THING’S MISS­ING</p>
    <p>To­day the world of sports in gen­eral and foot­ball in par­tic­u­lar has a void. One of the great­est sports­men in his­tory, Diego Maradona, has left us. What he did in foot­ball will re­main.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>HARD TO DE­SCRIBE</p>
    <p>RAFAEL NADAL, world No. 2 ten­nis star</p>
    <p>A very sad day for all Ar­gen­tini­ans and for foot­ball. He has left us but he isn’t go­ing any­where be­cause Diego is eter­nal. I’ll re­mem­ber the lovely mo­ments I ex­pe­ri­enced with him and I send my con­do­lences to his fam­ily and friends. Rest in peace.</p>
    <p>’’ SIM­MER­ING ANGER</p>
    <p>LIONEL MESSI, Ar­gentina cap­tain</p>
    <p>What I don’t like is that he never apol­o­gised. Never at any stage did he say he had cheated and that he would like to say sorry. In­stead, he used his ‘Hand of God’ line. That wasn’t right. It seems he had great­ness in him but sadly no sports­man­ship. But I am sad­dened to hear of his pass­ing at such a young age. He was un­doubt­edly</p>
    <p>the great­est player I ever faced.</p>
    <p>PETER SHILTON, for­mer Eng­land cus­to­dian, giv­ing grudg­ing credit to the man who bamboozled him in 1986</p>
