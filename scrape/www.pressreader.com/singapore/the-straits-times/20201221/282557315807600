    <p>Im­ran Hamid Kh­waja’s plan to push the In­ter­na­tional Cricket Coun­cil (ICC) to in­tro­duce “fair and eq­ui­table” tour­na­ment and fi­nan­cial dis­tri­bu­tion struc­tures which ben­e­fit the en­tire mem­ber­ship re­ceived a boost on Satur­day, af­ter he was re-elected the ICC board’s chair­man of as­so­ciate mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, 64, topped the polls, held over four days ear­lier in the week, with an over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity. He re­ceived 34 votes – the most among the eight can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Fel­low in­cum­bent Mahinda Val­lipu­ram of Malaysia also re­tained his po­si­tion with 19 votes, while Ber­muda’s Neil Speight gar­nered 16 votes.</p>
    <p>The strong back­ing for Im­ran came a month af­ter he was re­placed by Greg Bar­clay of New Zealand as the ICC chair­man, hav­ing tem­po­rar­ily taken over from In­dia’s Shashank Manohar in July.</p>
    <p>Im­ran, a part­ner at law firm Tan Ra­jah & Cheah, has been the chair­man of the ICC’s 92 mem­ber as­so­ciate na­tions since 2015, and also sits on key com­mit­tees, in­clud­ing those for fi­nance & com­mer­cial af­fairs, nom­i­na­tions, de­vel­op­ment (chair) and mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “What is heart­en­ing is that af­ter all these years of ser­vice, I still have the sup­port of al­most the en­tire mem­ber­ship, and there­fore it is an af­fir­ma­tion I have their con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>In the ICC, the 12 teams who play Test matches – Eng­land, Aus­tralia, South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand, In­dia, Pak­istan, Sri Lanka, Zim­babwe, Bangladesh, Ire­land and Afghanista­n – are recog­nised as full mem­bers while the rest are as­so­ciate mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Im­ran added that i n his l ast board meet­ing as act­ing chair­man, the ICC had passed a res­o­lu­tion to make a bid for cricket to be in­cluded in the 2028 Olympics.</p>
    <p>The im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity, how­ever, is to re­group as cricket picks up the pieces from a year se­verely dis­rupted by the Covid-19 cri­sis, he stressed.</p>
    <p>The 2020 and 2021 edi­tions of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup were both post­poned by one year.</p>
    <p>Im­ran said: “I am one of the few se­nior mem­bers of the or­gan­i­sa­tion, and you do need an ex­pe­ri­enced hand to help over­come the rav­ages of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“With that in mind, the im­me­di­ate press­ing pri­or­ity is to en­sure the eco­nomic sur­vival and sus­tain­abil­ity of not just the or­gan­i­sa­tion but the en­tire mem­ber­ship.”</p>
    <p>Among his plans is for the ICC to in­crease the num­ber of events to gen­er­ate more funds and pro­vide a greater spread of rev­enue.</p>
    <p>But it is un­der­stood some Test na­tions pre­fer more space in the cal­en­dar to al­low for lu­cra­tive bi­lat­eral se­ries – par­tic­u­larly among them­selves – and this clash of views was re­port­edly the rea­son be­hind some of cricket’s power bro­kers lob­by­ing against Im­ran’s chair­man­ship bid.</p>
    <p>He noted: “The as­so­ciate di­rec­tors serve the cause of the bet­ter­ment of the game while also pro­vid­ing the checks and bal­ances to en­sure that the gov­er­nance struc­tures of the or­gan­i­sa­tion serve the needs of the en­tire mem­ber­ship, and not just the full mem­ber na­tions.”</p>
    <p>Bar­clay wel­comed the elec­tion re­sults and said: “I look for­ward to con­tinue work­ing with Im­ran and Mahinda and get­ting Neil on board as we look to lead the sport and grow it around the world.”</p>
