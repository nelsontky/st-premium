    <p>Mr Zacharoy Dass has mixed feel­ings on Sin­ga­pore’s CMIO – Chi­nese-Malay-In­dian-Others – clas­si­fi­ca­tion frame­work.</p>
    <p>As the son of a Sin­ga­porean-In­dian fa­ther and Sin­ga­porean-Chi­nese mother, who stud­ied Chi­nese, he ap­pre­ci­ates how it was eas­ier to get a new Hous­ing Board flat when he and his Sin­ga­pore­anChi­nese wife ap­plied as a mi­nor­ity-race cou­ple.</p>
    <p>He owes this to the Eth­nic In­te­gra­tion Pol­icy (EIP) in­tro­duced in 1989, which en­sures a bal­anced mix of Chi­nese, Malays as well as In­di­ans and “others” in pub­lic hous­ing blocks and es­tates.</p>
    <p>He also thinks it is good for his 10-month-old daugh­ter to grow up among neigh­bours of dif­fer­ent races. But the 33-year-old pub­lic ser­vant wor­ries if it will be hard to move in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Un­der the EIP, he can sell only to fel­low mi­nori­ties should his block in Bukit Ba­tok reach its quota for Chi­nese own­ers.</p>
    <p>And he ad­mits to qui­etly pon­der­ing if down the road, his daugh­ter’s ca­reer prospects could be af­fected by her iden­tity card mark­ing her race as In­dian-Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>“If there’s a ques­tion about her race on a job ap­pli­ca­tion cover page, I won­der if that would come into play in the de­ci­sion to hire her or not,” he says. “But I’d like to think that by the time she gets there, 20 years from now, it’d be less of an is­sue, see­ing where we are headed in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tion and des­ti­na­tion for the state of race in Sin­ga­pore, an ev­er­green topic, resur­faced dur­ing the Gen­eral Elec­tion in July. Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob ac­knowl­edged the de­sire for more open con­ver­sa­tions in her speech at the open­ing of Par­lia­ment in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>At the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, Work­ers’ Party (WP) chair­man Sylvia Lim called for an open re­view of var­i­ous race-based poli­cies so that Sin­ga­pore’s jour­ney to­wards be­com­ing a race­blind so­ci­ety can be has­tened.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Ma­liki Os­man said that as much as the con­cept of a race-blind so­ci­ety free of prej­u­dice and dis­crim­i­na­tion is an ideal Sin­ga­pore wants to work to­wards, it was pre­ma­ture to con­clude that the coun­try has ar­rived at such a post-racial state.</p>
    <p>They said while it is im­por­tant to work to­wards a more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety, it is also im­por­tant to main­tain an aware­ness of and re­spect for dif­fer­ences be­tween groups.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar is­sues were brought to the fore in an in­for­mal opin­ion poll, con­ducted by con­ver­sa­tion en­gage­ment plat­form OPPi, of 500 Straits Times read­ers in­ter­ested in the topic of race.</p>
    <p>It drew a range of re­sponses and views on race-based mat­ters around stereo­typ­ing and dis­crim­i­na­tion, the CMIO model, Sin­ga­pore’s grow­ing mixed-race pop­u­la­tion, the no­tion of main­tain­ing racial pro­por­tions, and per­sonal as well as col­lec­tive iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say that to make head­way on these sub­jects, Sin­ga­pore must step up ed­u­ca­tion and out­reach ef­forts, em­brace more di­verse, com­plex rep­re­sen­ta­tions of the Sin­ga­porean iden­tity, and en­able more data trans­parency.</p>
    <p>TACK­LING STEREO­TYP­ING AND BIAS</p>
    <p>Mr Dass’ fam­ily is an ex­am­ple of how bound­aries be­tween the races are be­ing blurred, as more peo­ple marry across racial lines and see them­selves as Sin­ga­pore­ans first.</p>
    <p>At the same time, they feel that poli­cies to do with race pin them to a par­tic­u­lar iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Take Sin­ga­porean An­dre Frois. In 12 years of act­ing across films, TV shows and com­mer­cials, he has strug­gled to land local roles as a pro­tag­o­nist or pa­tri­arch.</p>
    <p>Vil­lain­ous parts, how­ever, come eas­ily to the Eurasian, who de­scribes his fa­ther as hav­ing Dutch, Por­tuguese and Per­anakan her­itage and his mother as “pure Teochew”.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are very open about it – when cast­ing for drug of­fend­ers or for­mer in­mates, it’s al­ways a brown per­son,” says Mr Frois.</p>
    <p>“And they’ll want a very Chi­nese-look­ing per­son to play the clean-cut, good guy.</p>
    <p>“Even though I’m half-Chi­nese, I’ve stopped au­di­tion­ing for cer­tain roles be­cause I know I will never get them.”</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­ri­ences like his are not com­mon­place, ac­cord­ing to Man­power Min­istry find­ings dis­closed in Par­lia­ment in February.</p>
    <p>A na­tion­ally rep­re­sen­ta­tive sur­vey in 2018 re­vealed that over eight in 10 job­seek­ers did not feel that race, gen­der, reli­gion, na­tion­al­ity and other mark­ers had stopped them from find­ing work.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an­other sur­vey con­ducted the same year by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies (IPS) showed that al­most 60 per cent of Malays and 56 per cent of In­di­ans per­ceived dis­crim­i­na­tory treat­ment at work, a slight rise from 58.7 per cent of Malays and 52.6 per cent of In­di­ans in 2013.</p>
    <p>The per­cep­tion of dis­crim­i­na­tion when ap­ply­ing for a job was four times higher for mi­nori­ties than for Chi­nese.</p>
    <p>In ST’s straw poll, a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of re­spon­dents said they had en­coun­tered racism at the work­place. They shared how they were asked ques­tions at job in­ter­views that would not have been asked of some­one from the ma­jor­ity race, or how at the work­place they were re­ferred to by their race rather than their name, and how most of their col­leagues spoke in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>Ms Za­rina Yu­sof, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of non-profit com­mu­nity group AMP Sin­ga­pore, says these sen­ti­ments mir­ror the find­ings of a small-scale youth per­cep­tion study done by AMP’s re­search arm in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>“Our re­spon­dents high­lighted in­stances of man­agers not ac­cord­ing the same kind of treat­ment for Malay and non-Malay em­ploy­ees; col­leagues form­ing cliques that ex­clude Malays from so­cial gath­er­ings; non-Malay col­leagues per­pet­u­at­ing stereo­types about Malays; and also in­stances where wear­ing the hi­jab is an is­sue,” she says.</p>
    <p>For­mer MP Intan Azura Mokhtar be­lieves of­fi­cial com­plaints about job dis­crim­i­na­tion are of­ten cases that have gone “over­board”, and that ca­sual racism con­tin­ues to oc­cur on a reg­u­lar, un­re­ported ba­sis. The aca­demic says she, too, has re­ceived her fair share of “cal­lous” work­place re­marks about her race.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gist Laa­vanya Kathi­rav­elu, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU), says: “Dis­crim­i­nated mi­nori­ties have to work harder to dis­pel dam­ag­ing stereo­types and at­tain recog­ni­tion for the same work. Others who are not sub­ject to stereo­types ben­e­fit from be­ing seen pos­i­tively or in neu­tral terms from the start.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “There are real con­se­quences in terms of im­ped­ing abil­ity to earn higher in­come and climb up the so­cioe­co­nomic lad­der, and im­pact­ing the progress of an en­tire com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Others have ques­tioned why Sin­ga­pore has yet to leg­is­late anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion laws in hir­ing.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts, wary of so­ci­ety be­com­ing overly liti­gious as an “easy way out”, say that on top of beef­ing up re­port­ing mech­a­nisms and puni­tive mea­sures, ed­u­ca­tion, out­reach and per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity of­fer a bet­ter, longer-term so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“These are sys­temic is­sues that can­not be changed by just tar­get­ing in­di­vid­ual be­hav­iour, but must go hand in hand with a na­tional ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum that pro­vides ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion about the in­equal­ity that racism gen­er­ates,” says Prof Kathi­rav­elu.</p>
    <p>Ms Za­rina calls for greater em­pa­thy from Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>She says: “One of the big­gest ob­sta­cles… is when the dis­crim­i­na­tor does not see dis­crim­i­na­tion as a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“If you view the dis­crim­i­nated group as be­ing too ‘sen­si­tive’, for ex­am­ple, we will never be able to neu­tralise dis­crim­i­na­tion, let alone erad­i­cate it.”</p>
    <p>Dr Intan, who is an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, says: “We want to be seen and treated as equals be­cause of our abil­i­ties and po­ten­tial, which should not be de­fined by our skin colour.</p>
    <p>“And we are not ask­ing for af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion or to­kenism ei­ther. All we hope for is fair­ness, ob­jec­tiv­ity and an equal op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>For his part, Mr Frois has made a con­scious choice to not get of­fended by stereo­types.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther does he deem it ap­pro­pri­ate to re­act to in­ci­dents of dis­crim­i­na­tion by tak­ing to so­cial me­dia or go­ing to the po­lice.</p>
    <p>“The best thing we can do is ad­dress it per­son to per­son, so they will un­der­stand why an ac­tion or re­mark was hurt­ful, and not make the same mis­take again,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Kind­ness is a lot bet­ter than just fight­ing fire with fire.”</p>
    <p>GO­ING BEYOND RACE</p>
    <p>If there’s a ques­tion about her race on a job ap­pli­ca­tion cover page, I won­der if that would come into play in the de­ci­sion to hire her or not. But I’d like to think that by the time she gets there, 20 years from now, it’d be less of an is­sue, see­ing where we are headed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>THE CMIO CHAL­LENGE</p>
    <p>For some, of­fi­cial frame­works such as CMIO are seen as a hur­dle to any race-blind as­pi­ra­tions, as</p>
    <p>MR ZACHAROY DASS, on his 10-month-old daugh­ter’s ca­reer prospects in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>they box up and draw lines be­tween the dif­fer­ent races.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers ques­tion the need to re­tain the ex­plicit list­ing of race on na­tional iden­tity cards.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim had, in her Par­lia­ment speech, said the CMIO model and race-based self-help groups re­in­force racial con­scious­ness.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent gauge of pub­lic sen­ti­ment to­wards CMIO, cap­tured in an­other IPS sur­vey in 2016, found that most saw it as help­ing to build trust and greater in­ter­ac­tion be­tween races, as well as to safe­guard mi­nor­ity rights.</p>
    <p>ST’s poll re­spon­dents were split on the rel­e­vance of the CMIO model, although those who were older and Chi­nese were more in­clined to ap­prove of it.</p>
    <p>Dr Intan sug­gests the role of self­help groups should be re­viewed.</p>
    <p>“We can prob­a­bly keep race­based or­gan­i­sa­tions to pro­mote and en­cour­age the cel­e­bra­tion of cul­tures and tra­di­tions, rather than the pro­vi­sion of as­sis­tance ac­cord­ing to race or eth­nic­ity,” she says.</p>
    <p>IPS’ se­nior re­search fel­low Mathew Mathews ac­knowl­edges that some Sin­ga­pore­ans are con­cerned about the CMIO model, but be­lieves they do not re­ally want to do away with it.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, if you ask sur­vey re­spon­dents about fea­tures of so­ci­ety which are en­abled by the model, such as the im­por­tance of pro­por­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Par­lia­ment, many will agree,” he says.</p>
    <p>“What they want is a re­visit of the CMIO model so there is an ex­pan­sion of cat­e­gories, to in­clude other races like Eurasian, Filipino, and sub-eth­nic iden­ti­ties such as Chi­nese-In­dian.”</p>
    <p>Other ob­servers agree on the need to even­tu­ally move beyond CMIO cat­e­gories, to bet­ter in­clude more com­plex racial iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>They cite the ris­ing trend of mixed-race and mixed-na­tion­al­ity mar­riages and births.</p>
    <p>Says Dr Intan: “The dou­ble-bar­relled race pro­vi­sion in our iden­tity card may no longer be suf­fi­cient. Then do we have triple-bar­relled race pro­vi­sion? Quadru­ple­bar­relled race pro­vi­sion? Where does it end?”</p>
    <p>NTU as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of sociology Shan­non Ang es­ti­mates, work­ing off of­fi­cial data, that about one in 10 in this year’s Pri­mary 1 school batch, and about 13 per cent of ba­bies born in Sin­ga­pore last year, are of mixed-race parent­age.</p>
    <p>“How are we go­ing to fit these peo­ple into the racial ‘bal­ance’ as they grow up?” asks Prof Ang, who raised the pos­si­bil­ity of the mixe­drace pop­u­la­tion – if they are given the op­tion to be iden­ti­fied as a dis­tinct group – ex­ceed­ing the num­bers of In­dian or even Malay per­sons in Sin­ga­pore one day.</p>
    <p>“The CMIO cat­e­gories have worked for us in the past, but the mean­ing of those groups is chang­ing. So how can we still pro­mote the sta­bil­ity that’s de­sired?”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers are also crit­i­cal of the Gov­ern­ment’s use of the CMIO model to frame racial pro­por­tions and em­pha­sise a need to main­tain the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to per­cep­tions of a mi­grant in­flux from China or In­dia, the au­thor­i­ties have cited how cit­i­zen racial pro­por­tions have been kept “sta­ble” over the past decade through “cal­i­brated” im­mi­gra­tion in­take that main­tains the pop­u­la­tion ra­tios of Chi­nese at 76 per cent, Malays at 15 per cent, In­di­ans at 7.5 per cent and other races at 1.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Prof Ang says: “There’s an as­sump­tion, even ex­pec­ta­tion, that peo­ple we bring in to be new ci­ti­zens are ho­mo­ge­neous and sim­i­lar to the racial or eth­nic groups we’ve as­signed in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mathews be­lieves that while the re­al­ity is most – in­clud­ing mi­nori­ties – want Sin­ga­pore to con­tinue be­ing a Chi­nese-ma­jor­ity so­ci­ety, the Gov­ern­ment has placed more em­pha­sis on be­ing Sin­ga­porean than be­ing part of any racial group.</p>
    <p>But the ob­servers are di­vided on whether the march to a col­lec­tive, na­tional iden­tity would tran­scend the need for CMIO.</p>
    <p>“As there are in­suf­fi­cient cul­tural mark­ers of Sin­ga­pore­aness, the broader no­tion of ‘Sin­ga­porean first’ ex­ists to­gether and si­mul­ta­ne­ously with other prac­tices,” says Dr Mathews. “There are par­tic­u­lar Sin­ga­porean-Chi­nese, Sin­ga­porean-Malay, Sin­ga­porean-In­dian iden­ti­ties that have been cre­ated here – this hy­phen­ation has been the way Sin­ga­pore­ans have looked at it for ages.”</p>
    <p>Prof Kathi­rav­elu says mi­nori­ties are of­ten not ac­knowl­edged as “Sin­ga­porean enough”, pos­si­bly due to de­pic­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans and Sin­ga­pore as largely Chi­nese, such as in the 2018 Hol­ly­wood film Crazy Rich Asians.</p>
    <p>She says this points to a need for more di­verse rep­re­sen­ta­tions beyond CMIO.</p>
    <p>“CMIO may no longer be use­ful in terms of fos­ter­ing com­mu­nity iden­tity or as a tool for gov­er­nance,” she says.</p>
    <p>“We should ac­knowl­edge that CMIO may be re­duc­tive in its as­sump­tions of affin­ity and shared iden­tity.”</p>
    <p>WILL MORE DATA HELP?</p>
    <p>For most of the ob­servers in­ter­viewed, a key to bet­ter un­der­stand­ing – and man­ag­ing – is­sues to do with race, like dis­crim­i­na­tion and iden­tity, lies in more data be­ing avail­able from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing more data pub­lic, they say, will help ad­vance the con­ver­sa­tion on craft­ing bet­ter poli­cies to nar­row gaps be­tween the races.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, WP’s Ms Lim noted that while the Gov­ern­ment might have rea­sons for be­ing se­lec­tive on data to de­clas­sify, this lack of in­for­ma­tion was hin­der­ing an ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the chal­lenges faced by par­tic­u­lar races.</p>
    <p>She re­lated how the Sin­ga­pore Pri­son Ser­vice could not pro­vide her with a break­down of the in­mate pop­u­la­tion by eth­nic­ity.</p>
    <p>“So­ci­ety at large should have an in­ter­est in whether those serv­ing jail sen­tences are a mi­cro­cosm of so­ci­ety or whether cer­tain eth­nic­i­ties are dis­pro­por­tion­ately be­ing im­pris­oned,” she said.</p>
    <p>“There should be pub­lic aware­ness of any chal­lenges faced by par­tic­u­lar com­mu­ni­ties, and a wholeof-so­ci­ety ap­proach should be en­cour­aged.”</p>
    <p>Dr Mathews, how­ever, con­tends the gen­eral Sin­ga­porean pop­u­lace would not be keen on the Gov­ern­ment re­leas­ing de­tailed data on race.</p>
    <p>“For health (statis­tics), peo­ple are a bit more open. But for is­sues like how many are in pri­son for drugs, many Sin­ga­pore­ans are ac­tu­ally not very com­fort­able with that,” he says.</p>
    <p>“They feel that pro­fil­ing peo­ple based on crime com­mit­ted doesn’t help very much on the big­ger agenda.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ang says that for a start, the Gov­ern­ment could re­lease sur­vey data it col­lects, to help re­searchers in­ves­ti­gate key is­sues and spe­cific rea­sons be­hind racial dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, he says, con­ver­sa­tions will re­main purely spec­u­la­tive and ab­stract.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that aca­demics study­ing Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety have been call­ing for more ac­cu­rate data for some time, Prof Kathi­rav­elu says: “This is the first step in ad­dress­ing in­equal­ity be­tween race groups, so that we can strive to­wards a mer­i­to­cratic so­ci­ety where there is a more level play­ing field.”</p>
