    <p>GIL­LIAN CHUNG IS BACK AT WORK: Less than a week after her head in­jury, Hong Kong star Gil­lian Chung has qui­etly re­turned to work.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Chi­nese ac­tor</p>
    <p>Ray Zhang’s agency posted two pho­tos of the two of them to­gether, hold­ing a bou­quet of flow­ers each and flash­ing a</p>
    <p>V-sign.</p>
    <p>Chung’s ges­ture cov­ered the spot of her in­jury, but she was smil­ing in the pho­tos.</p>
    <p>The agency wrote in Chi­nese: “Con­grat­u­la­tions to Ray Zhang for com­plet­ing the shoot­ing of the film, as he rushes to the next show. Very happy to be work­ing with great beauty Gil­lian Chung. Wish­ing you a speedy re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Chung, 39 was act­ing with Zhang, 33, in a show which was sup­posed to wrap up film­ing last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ac­tress-singer, one half of Can­topop duo Twins, had an ac­ci­dent that day in her ho­tel room in Xi­a­men, China.</p>
    <p>She felt giddy while go­ing to the toi­let and lost her bal­ance, hitting her head against a mar­ble struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Her wound was re­ported to be 6cm long and she re­quired dozens of stitches at the hos­pi­tal. She then went for a sec­ond op­er­a­tion by a top plas­tic sur­geon, one with hun­dreds of stitches, to re­duce the like­li­hood of scar­ring on her face.</p>
    <p>Chung’s man­ager Mani Fok told the Hong Kong me­dia she ini­tially wanted to re­sume film­ing im­me­di­ately after her in­jury, but was ad­vised to rest for a few days be­fore do­ing so.</p>
    <p>The singer was said to have taken medicine to re­duce swelling be­fore the day of film­ing and was praised by the crew for her pro­fes­sion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Ms Fok added that Chung still has one more movie to film in China be­fore she re­turns to</p>
    <p>Hong Kong.</p>
