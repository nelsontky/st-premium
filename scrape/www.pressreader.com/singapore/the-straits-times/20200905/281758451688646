    <p>Al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments to hold vir­tual an­nual gen­eral meet­ings (AGMs) and share­holder meet­ings can con­tinue re­gard­less of whether Covid-19 re­stric­tions are in place.</p>
    <p>This was among the amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act that were passed ur­gently in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the se­cond read­ing of the amend­ment Bill, Se­cond Min­is­ter for Law Ed­win Tong said his min­istry in­tends to ex­tend the time­frame to al­low al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments for such meet­ings un­til June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, com­pa­nies, so­ci­eties and char­i­ties are al­lowed to do so un­til Sept 30. Be­fore the amend­ments, al­ter­na­tive meet­ing ar­range­ments un­der the Act were tied to the du­ra­tion of a Covid-19 con­trol or­der.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said an ex­ten­sion will give these en­ti­ties the op­tion to hold vir­tual meet­ings, even when phys­i­cal meet­ings are al­lowed un­der the pre­vail­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions, and will help to lower the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Other amend­ments passed yes­ter­day in­clude ex­ten­sion of dead­lines for col­lec­tive sales spec­i­fied un­der the Land Ti­tles (Strata Act) on a case-by-case ba­sis through min­is­te­rial or­ders.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, asses­sors ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) will now have en­hanced pow­ers to spec­ify the amount of rent waiver in some cases when deal­ing with land­lord-ten­ant dis­putes un­der the rental re­lief frame­work.</p>
    <p>The amend­ments also clar­ify that once an ap­pli­ca­tion for re­lief is made for some con­tracts af­fected by breaches or de­lays in con­struc­tion, sup­ply or re­lated con­tracts, par­ties can­not start other le­gal pro­ceed­ings, un­til the ap­pli­ca­tion is re­jected or with­drawn or un­til a de­ter­mi­na­tion is made by an as­ses­sor.</p>
    <p>Ad­ju­di­ca­tors for the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion In­dus­try Se­cu­rity of Pay­ment Act (Sopa) are now also given the same pow­ers as MinLawap­pointed asses­sors to ad­just con­tract terms in these cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said this will lower the risk of hav­ing par­al­lel pro­ceed­ings, and al­low for just and eq­ui­table out­comes from the res­o­lu­tion of dis­putes in Sopa pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) MPs rose to speak in sup­port of the amend­ment Bill yes­ter­day, with Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC) and Mr Zhulka­r­nain Ab­dul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC) call­ing for MinLaw to con­sider al­low­ing al­ter­na­tive meet­ing ar­range­ments be­yond the Covid-19 pe­riod, as they have proved to be cost-ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Tong said that un­der the Com­pa­nies Act, as long as the con­sti­tu­tion of com­pa­nies or or­gan­i­sa­tions al­lows for it, meet­ings can be held in a non­phys­i­cal man­ner.</p>
    <p>“But for the mo­ment, our in­ten­tion... is to give cer­tainty to com­pa­nies who are plan­ning for the yearend AGMs, some as far as six months down the road, and we want them to know that they will be cov­ered by the al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments,” he said, adding that be­yond that, MinLaw will as­sess the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“For the long term, we’ll study it and if this is some­thing that is use­ful and work­able, we’ll con­sider whether or not and to what ex­tent we can in­cor­po­rate that into a more per­ma­nent po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>MPs ASK FOR EX­TEN­SION AND SIM­PLI­FI­CA­TION OF RE­LIEF FRAME­WORK</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) asked if MinLaw will con­sider ex­tend­ing the re­lief pe­riod for in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses from their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions be­yond Oc­to­ber this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong replied that MinLaw will mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion be­fore de­cid­ing whether it will be nec­es­sary to ex­tend the re­lief pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“We have to bear in mind that it’s in­tru­sive to step in to in­ter­vene with par­ties’ con­tracts. So we do that ju­di­ciously and we al­ways have to keep an eye on whether or not it’s ap­pro­pri­ate, what is the right level of in­ter­ven­tion and whether... the cir­cum­stances re­quire the in­ter­ven­tion,” said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>He also noted that the num­ber of no­ti­fi­ca­tions for re­lief sub­mit­ted in July and Au­gust has de­clined, com­pared with May and June.</p>
    <p>This could either be due to fewer dis­putes be­tween par­ties, or be­cause peo­ple are be­com­ing more ed­u­cated on the re­lief frame­work and are get­ting bet­ter at ne­go­ti­at­ing the terms of their con­tracts out­side of the frame­work, he added.</p>
    <p>He was also asked by PAP MP Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) if more can be done to ed­u­cate ten­ants and sub-ten­ants of their rental re­lief rights un­der the frame­work, while Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) asked if the ap­pli­ca­tion process can be made sim­pler as some small land­lords and ten­ants may strug­gle with it.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said MinLaw has ex­plained the frame­work “as best as we can”, with a ded­i­cated web­site set up, and sev­eral we­bi­nars were con­ducted by him­self and Law Min­is­ter K. Shanmugam, as well as com­mu­nity out­reach ef­forts.</p>
    <p>He added that MinLaw of­fi­cers have also been as­sist­ing ap­pli­cants in the process, and urged Ms Lim to con­tact the min­istry for as­sis­tance if she knows of any cases that have fallen through the cracks.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the amend­ments, al­ter­na­tive meet­ing ar­range­ments un­der the Act were tied to the du­ra­tion of a Covid-19 con­trol or­der. Mr Tong said an ex­ten­sion will give these en­ti­ties the op­tion to hold vir­tual meet­ings, even when phys­i­cal meet­ings are al­lowed un­der the pre­vail­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions, and will help to lower the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion.</p>
