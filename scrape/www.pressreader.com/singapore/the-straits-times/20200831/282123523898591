    <p>Three re­cent drug traf­fick­ing ap­peal cases, which all led to ac­quit­tals be­fore the apex court, have clar­i­fied key is­sues in these laws.</p>
    <p>One ac­quit­tal saw a top court de­ci­sion more than two decades old over­ruled. An­other ex­am­ined knowl­edge in re­la­tion to drug pos­ses­sion, while the third un­der­lined the im­por­tance of doc­u­ment dis­clo­sure for the ac­cused.</p>
    <p>In April, the Court of Ap­peal ac­quit­ted drug courier Sar­a­vanan Chan­daram of one charge of im­port­ing cannabis mix­ture, while up­hold­ing his con­vic­tion on a sec­ond charge of im­port­ing cannabis.</p>
    <p>Sar­a­vanan’s life im­pris­on­ment sen­tence re­mained un­changed but the court re­duced the 24 strokes of the cane im­posed on him to 15 strokes.</p>
    <p>The re­served judg­ment by the three-judge court headed by Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon over­ruled the pre­vi­ous in­ter­pre­ta­tion of “cannabis mix­ture” in 1996 and held that cannabis mix­ture meant a mix­ture of cannabis and an­other type of plant mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The 1996 de­ci­sion had de­fined cannabis mix­ture as a mix of dif­fer­ent grades of cannabis, or a mix of dif­fer­ent parts of the cannabis plant.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the At­tor­neyGen­eral’s Cham­bers said that af­ter the Court of Ap­peal had ob­served in March 2018 that there may be dif­fi­cul­ties re­lat­ing to the cannabis mix­ture charge Sar­a­vanan faced, the pros­e­cu­tion stopped pre­fer­ring charges in re­la­tion to cannabis mix­ture in sim­i­lar cases in­volv­ing blocks of cannabis-re­lated plant ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>It also with­drew or stood down such charges if they had al­ready been pre­ferred.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond case, also in April, the top court ac­quit­ted con­victed drug traf­ficker Muham­mad Na­bill Mohd Fuad on ap­peal of two cap­i­tal drug charges and sen­tenced him to eight years’ jail in­stead for drug pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>The court, among other things in its de­ci­sion grounds, ruled the pros­e­cu­tion is un­der a duty to dis­close to the de­fence the statement of a wit­ness who can be ex­pected to con­firm or, con­versely, con­tra­dict the ac­cused per­son’s de­fence.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the de­ci­sion on the firm’s web­site, Drew and Napier lawyer Wen­dell Wong said it “is a po­ten­tial game-changer for crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings. It sig­nif­i­cantly lev­els the play­ing field and the in­for­ma­tion dis­par­ity be­tween the pros­e­cu­tion and the de­fence”.</p>
    <p>In the same month, a five-judge Court of Ap­peal al­lowed Mo­ham­mad Azli Mo­ham­mad Salleh’s ap­peal against a 2019 con­vic­tion on a cap­i­tal drug traf­fick­ing charge in the High Court.</p>
    <p>This case had im­pli­cated Azli of abet­ting one Roszaidi Os­man in traf­fick­ing di­amor­phine by driv­ing him to col­lect two pack­ets at Jurong West and then driv­ing Roszaidi to meet Roszaidi’s wife to pass her the drugs.</p>
    <p>The court in its 55-page judg­ment said that while it re­jected Azli’s con­tention that he had no knowl­edge at all that con­trolled drugs were in­volved, it does not lead to the con­clu­sion that he must there­fore have known that the drugs were heroin.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law pro­fes­sor Chan Wing Cheong said: “The (three) cases show that the courts strive to en­sure that the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem op­er­ates fairly and that the scope of the Mis­use of Drugs Act is care­fully scru­ti­nised”.</p>
