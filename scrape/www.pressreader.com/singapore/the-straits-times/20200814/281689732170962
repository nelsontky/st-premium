    <p>WASHINGTON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­leased rec­om­men­da­tions for re­open­ing schools amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, in­clud­ing that masks be used when so­cial dis­tanc­ing is not pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said at a White House press brief­ing on Wed­nes­day evening that the fed­eral gov­ern­ment would pro­vide 125 mil­lion re­us­able masks to school dis­tricts around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“We want them (schools) to open soon and safely, and we’re com­ing up with eight mea­sures or so on how to do that, which will be an­nounced to­day,” White House ad­viser Kellyanne Con­way said in an in­ter­view with Fox News chan­nel ahead of the brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Prior to the brief­ing, Mr Trump had held a schools event where a small group of par­ents, teach­ers and as­sorted other in­di­vid­u­als called for the re­open­ing of schools and ar­gued the im­por­tance of in­per­son learn­ing.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has re­peat­edly pushed for schools to re­open, say­ing there are low risks to young peo­ple from the virus, even as teach­ers and pub­lic health ex­perts have raised the alarm about whether it can be done safely.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite his ef­forts, most of the coun­try’s largest school dis­tricts have said they will start the school year with on­line classes, as states across the coun­try con­tinue to bat­tle an on­slaught of cases.</p>
    <p>“Vir­tual (ed­u­ca­tion) is not as good as be­ing there. Vir­tual is just not the same thing,” Mr Trump said at the White House event.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump crit­i­cised as “a lit­tle ridicu­lous” some school dis­tricts’ plans to have stu­dents at­tend in per­son some days and on­line on other days so that they have enough space to so­cially dis­tance in class­rooms. He said he be­lieved stu­dents should re­turn to class ev­ery week­day.</p>
    <p>Opin­ion polls have found that sup­port for full-time, in-per­son school­ing has dropped as the pan­demic has dragged on, though Repub­li­cans are sig­nif­i­cantly more likely to back stu­dents’ re­turn to class­rooms full-time in the au­tumn than Democrats are.</p>
