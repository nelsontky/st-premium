    <p>STOCKHOLM • Bud­get fur­ni­ture gi­ant Ikea said it has taken the emo­tional de­ci­sion to end a seven-decade tra­di­tion and dis­con­tinue its cat­a­logue, one of the world’s big­gest an­nual pub­li­ca­tions, as shop­pers move on­line.</p>
    <p>The pub­li­ca­tion reached a peak in 2016, when more than 200 mil­lion copies were dis­trib­uted to house­holds and Ikea stores in more than 50 mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Its very first edi­tion, in 1951, fea­tur­ing the MK Wing Chair on the cover, had a print run of 285,000 copies and was dis­trib­uted in south­ern Swe­den.</p>
    <p>The last one, from this year, runs to 40 mil­lion copies.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion is part of Ikea’s push to be­come more dig­i­tal as con­sumers in­creas­ingly seek in­spi­ra­tion on­line, as well as shop­ping via the Web.</p>
    <p>In the 12 months to end-Au­gust, Ikea’s on­line sales jumped 45 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of copies has gone down, but we have also seen that peo­ple have much more used our web­site, apps and so­cial me­dia. The cat­a­logue be­came less and less im­por­tant,” said Mr Kon­rad Gruss, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at fran­chiser In­ter Ikea Sys­tems – a di­vi­sion of brand owner In­ter Ikea Group.</p>
    <p>“The in­ter­est in the cat­a­logue has come down,” he told Reuters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Gruss, an Ikea vet­eran who took on the new po­si­tion in June, said he felt emo­tional about the de­ci­sion as the cat­a­logue has been a big part of Ikea for him and for other em­ploy­ees who grew up with it.</p>
    <p>“This (the cat­a­logue) has been such an im­por­tant thing for us,” he said.</p>
    <p>The cat­a­logue has tra­di­tion­ally been a big part of Ikea’s mar­ket­ing bud­get, he said, but de­clined to give fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The money saved will be spent on mar­ket­ing on­line and through other chan­nels.</p>
    <p>Ikea is also work­ing on a smaller print pub­li­ca­tion, fo­cused on pro­vid­ing in­spi­ra­tion for home fur­nish­ing, to be avail­able in stores next year, he said.</p>
    <p>The cat­a­logue has sparked con­tro­versy on some oc­ca­sions, such as when Ikea in 2012 air­brushed women out of a Saudi Ara­bia ver­sion, rais­ing ques­tions about the group’s poli­cies to­wards gen­der equal­ity.</p>
