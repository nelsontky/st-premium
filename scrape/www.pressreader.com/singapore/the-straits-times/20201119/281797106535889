    <p>Young peo­ple around the world are suf­fer­ing far more from the fall­out of the Covid-19 pan­demic than are other groups, judg­ing by a re­cent global sur­vey by the Fi­nan­cial Times (FT) of more than 800 peo­ple aged be­tween 16 and 30.</p>
    <p>It found that their lev­els of anx­i­ety about the fu­ture and their re­sent­ment to­wards the older gen­er­a­tion are on the rise, with the pan­demic ex­ac­er­bat­ing many of the prob­lems they were al­ready fac­ing – in­clud­ing low wages, stag­nant job mar­kets and ris­ing stu­dent debt.</p>
    <p>In one Amer­i­can fam­ily of 10 young adult sib­lings in New Jer­sey, five have been on ther­apy since the pan­demic be­gan, and the re­main­ing five have moved in with their par­ents.</p>
    <p>“Some­one had a break­down about once a week,” Ms Mary Finnegan, 27, told the FT.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing home was “like a re­turn to home­school­ing: No boys, no play dates, nowhere to go, ex­cept home and the liquor store”, she said.</p>
    <p>In Ma­ha­rash­tra, In­dia, Ms Ko­mal Kadam, 28, has been wor­ried since she lost her job in March. Un­til then, she had been her fam­ily’s sole bread­win­ner.</p>
    <p>“I am scared of ev­ery­thing,” Ms Kadam said. “Can I get a new job? How will I pay my loans? (There are) lots of things on my mind.”</p>
    <p>Those be­low the age of 26 are 21/ times more likely to be un­em­ployed be­cause of the pan­demic com­pared with the 26 to 64 age group, data from the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment shows.</p>
    <p>About half of those who are still hold­ing on to their jobs say their earn­ings have dropped. Many have had to dip into their sav­ings.</p>
    <p>A poll by mar­ket re­search firm Ip­sos Mori of more than 14,000 adults last month showed that peo­ple be­low 35 were more likely than their older peers to feel that things in their coun­try are out of con­trol right now.</p>
    <p>LOSS OF FAITH IN DEMOC­RACY</p>
    <p>The young are also in­creas­ingly los­ing faith in democ­racy.</p>
    <p>A study from the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge’s Cen­tre for the Fu­ture of Democ­racy, which looked at polls con­ducted be­tween 1973 and this year of four mil­lion adults from 75 coun­tries, found a sig­nif­i­cant down­ward trend in sat­is­fac­tion with democ­racy among younger peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents to the FT sur­vey – ex­cept for some Euro­peans and Asians – said that they were dis­ap­pointed in their lead­ers for their poor han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The world was say­ing A and Brazil­ian pol­i­tics were scream­ing Z,” 29-year-old Brazil­ian Danilo Ven­tura told the FT, adding that he and his wife abided by so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules un­der or­ders from the re­gional gov­ern­ment in Sao Paulo, even though Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro con­tin­ued at­tend­ing crowded events.</p>
    <p>The lack of co­or­di­nated di­rec­tion and timely ac­tion from the lead­er­ship has seen Brazil hit with the se­cond-worst death toll from Covid-19, after the United States.</p>
    <p>In Glas­gow, Scot­land, 28-yearold John lamented: “The air­ports were opened too long. The mes­sag­ing on masks was dis­grace­ful… We re­ally are han­dling this ter­ri­bly.”</p>
    <p>As the present chaos across the globe trans­lates into grow­ing dis­gruntle­ment among young peo­ple to­wards their lead­ers and older gen­er­a­tions, Cana­dian Polina R., 30, summed up the mood among them.</p>
    <p>“We’re not in this to­gether, mil­len­ni­als have to take the brunt of the sac­ri­fice.”</p>
    <p>STRONGER RE­SOLVE TO IM­PROVE</p>
    <p>Not all is lost, though. The pan­demic ap­pears to have re­in­forced the younger gen­er­a­tion’s re­solve and vi­sion to build a bet­ter fu­ture, with the cri­sis prov­ing to be a mo­ti­vat­ing fac­tor for many to take ac­tion to pos­i­tively im­pact their com­mu­ni­ties, Deloitte’s an­nual Global Mil­len­nial Sur­vey re­leased in June showed.</p>
    <p>It sur­veyed more than 18,000 young peo­ple across at least 43 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“De­spite un­cer­tain and dis­cour­ag­ing con­di­tions, mil­len­ni­als and Gen Zs ex­press im­pres­sive re­siliency and a re­solve to im­prove the world,” Ms Michele Parmelee, Deloitte’s global chief peo­ple and pur­pose of­fi­cer, said.</p>
    <p>“As we re­build our economies and so­ci­ety, young peo­ple will be crit­i­cal in shap­ing the world that emerges.”</p>
    <p>A World Bank cam­paign tar­get­ing youth at­ti­tudes and per­spec­tives amid the pan­demic also found re­silience a res­onat­ing theme in the feed­back it re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“For some, this pan­demic is a rain­bow, and for some, a dark cloud,” Mr So­ham, a youth re­spon­dent from In­dia, said in a video sub­mis­sion to the World Bank cam­paign. “All of us know that both don’t stay for long.”</p>
