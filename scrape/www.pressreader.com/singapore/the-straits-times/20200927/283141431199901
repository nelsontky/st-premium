    <p>The chips are down for the casino busi­ness at the world-renowned Las Ve­gas Strip.</p>
    <p>Gam­bling rev­enue has dropped about 40 per cent so far this year and a turn­around is nowhere in sight. Some ho­tels are even of­fer­ing rock-bot­tom rates – US$10 (S$14) a night and yet there are few tak­ers. So how bad is the busi­ness now? At a re­cent poker com­pe­ti­tion at Cae­sars Palace, only 13 play­ers turned up.</p>
    <p>Wel­come to Las Ve­gas in the time of coro­n­avirus. The city be­gan re­open­ing its giant casino ho­tels on June 4 but guests – par­tic­u­larly those trav­el­ling by air – have been re­luc­tant to re­turn. The over­all num­ber of visi­tors tum­bled 61 per cent to 1.4 mil­lion in July, the first full month the casi­nos were open.</p>
    <p>Gam­bling rev­enue on the Strip fell 39 per cent to US$330 mil­lion from a year ago.</p>
    <p>Re­sort op­er­a­tors have been try­ing to lure guests with dis­counted rooms. A re­cent stay at Bally’s, a Cae­sars prop­erty, cost US$10 a night. The bill for three nights with taxes and re­sort fees was US$130. Room ser­vice was not of­fered.</p>
    <p>It has been pretty dev­as­tat­ing for ev­ery­one, es­pe­cially on the Strip, be­cause the con­ven­tion busi­ness is gone. Lo­cal of­fi­cials have pro­hib­ited gath­er­ings of more than 50 peo­ple, a killer for the cru­cial meet­ing and con­ven­tion busi­ness.</p>
    <p>With fewer guests and re­duced ca­pac­ity, re­sorts have been re­luc­tant to bring back work­ers.</p>
    <p>MGM said last month it was lay­ing off 18,000 em­ploy­ees na­tion­wide, most of them in Las Ve­gas.</p>
    <p>Signs in the casi­nos re­mind pa­trons that masks are re­quired and en­cour­age safety pro­to­cols like so­cial dis­tanc­ing and fre­quent hand­wash­ing. Only four peo­ple at a time are al­lowed in lifts though that some­times seems to be ig­nored.</p>
    <p>The slot ma­chine floors look dif­fer­ent as well, of­ten with ev­ery other ma­chine dis­abled to en­force so­cial dis­tanc­ing. The core slot play­ers, older guests, have been hes­i­tant to travel due to the virus, noted Mr Nick Ho­gan, whose ReelMet­rics tracks slot ma­chine data.</p>
    <p>He called the se­nior short­age “un­ques­tion­ably the pan­demic’s great­est threat to casi­nos glob­ally”.</p>
    <p>Mr Adam Wies­berg, gen­eral man­ager of the El Cortez casino in down­town Las Ve­gas, said he had re­moved more than 200 slot ma­chines and put the rest in cir­cu­lar or X-shaped con­fig­u­ra­tions so play­ers can keep their dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Ex­tra work­ers on the casino floor are on hand to wipe the de­vices. “We try to get them cleaned as soon as some­body stands up,” he said.</p>
    <p>Wynn Re­sorts has taken an un­usual step of re­leas­ing de­tailed Covid-19 test­ing data for its em­ploy­ees and guests. The com­pany said 548 of its work­ers tested pos­i­tive last week out of more than 15,000 tests ad­min­is­tered.</p>
    <p>Con­tact trac­ing that the com­pany per­formed with 10 in-house staff sug­gested 98 per cent of the ill­nesses were caught out­side or at work. Out of some 500,000 over­all visi­tors since June, six tested pos­i­tive af­ter in-room ex­ams.</p>
    <p>Wynn has since re­opened its poker room.</p>
    <p>Changes in poker rooms are easy to spot. Seat­ing at the ta­bles has been re­duced to eight play­ers from 10 and each guest is sep­a­rated by a plas­tic di­vider.</p>
    <p>Ta­bles are cleaned af­ter ev­ery 30 min­utes with a change of deal­ers. Hand sani­tiser is freely dis­pensed to any­one who asks for it.</p>
    <p>Ve­gas’ fa­mous free drinks are tougher to get, with one server apparently han­dling the whole room at Cae­sars.</p>
    <p>Masks make it harder to read the play­ers’ faces. Voices are muf­fled, so it is harder to hear too, whether it is some­one an­nounc­ing a raise, or just mak­ing chit-chat.</p>
    <p>One player had to be re­minded sev­eral times by a dealer to keep his mask above his nose. He grum­bled that he had trou­ble breath­ing but he com­plied.</p>
