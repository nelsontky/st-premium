    <p>A Chi­nese phrase stands out in de­scrib­ing the var­ied body of work of vet­eran Sin­ga­pore ar­chi­tect Mok Wei Wei.</p>
    <p>“Jing sui bu yi”, which means “chang­ing scenery fol­lows the foot­steps”, is one of the many dy­namic forces driv­ing Mr Mok’s de­signs.</p>
    <p>The pithy say­ing is taken from one of the el­e­ments of clas­si­cal Chi­nese gar­dens, where the vis­ual fi­nale – of­ten a dra­matic gar­den scene – is reached af­ter one nav­i­gates bends and curves.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok – whose firm W Ar­chi­tects’ first mono­graph de­tail­ing 35 years of ar­chi­tec­tural de­signs was re­leased ear­lier this month by</p>
    <p>Lon­don-based pub­lisher Thames & Hud­son – was men­tored by Sin­ga­pore’s pioneer ar­chi­tect Wil­liam S.W. Lim. This took place dur­ing a for­ma­tive time in na­tion-build­ing from the early 1980s till 2003 when Mr Lim re­tired.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok found him­self in­volved in sev­eral sig­nif­i­cant ur­ban projects that have ad­vanced what he terms “Sin­ga­pore Ar­chi­tec­ture”.</p>
    <p>“What fas­ci­nates me about a Chi­nese gar­den is not the clas­si­cal form of the ar­chi­tec­ture and its or­na­men­ta­tions. Nei­ther am I at­tracted to the re­fined and po­etic land­scap­ing,” says the 64-year-old, who hails from a traditiona­l Chi­nese fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“It is the spa­tial com­po­si­tion in a Chi­nese gar­den that I find in­trigu­ing. This con­sists of the or­derly and se­quen­tial lay­out of its res­i­den­tial quar­ter, in con­trast with the or­ganic, fluid spa­ces of the gar­den proper.”</p>
    <p>The ar­chi­tect is the only son of the late Mok Lee Kwang, for­mer chief ed­i­tor of Nanyang Siang Pau and Lianhe Zaobao.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the China-born news­pa­per man wanted his chil­dren to be artists or mu­si­cians, Mr Mok and his three sis­ters were rig­or­ously schooled in Chi­nese cul­ture.</p>
    <p>He is well-versed in the four Chi­nese lit­er­ary clas­sics and also stud­ied paint­ing un­der Sin­ga­pore’s pioneer artists Chen Wen Hsi, from 1963 to 1970, and Thomas Yeo from 1970 to 1971.</p>
    <p>He also ob­tained a Li­cen­ti­ate of the Royal Schools of Mu­sic pi­ano per­form­ing cer­tifi­cate in 1974.</p>
    <p>The for­mer stu­dent of Angli­can High grad­u­ated from the School of Ar­chi­tec­ture at the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore in 1982.</p>
    <p>“In Chi­nese gar­den ar­chi­tec­ture, the two op­pos­ing el­e­ments come to­gether to form a har­mo­nious whole, giv­ing it a du­al­ity that makes for an ab­sorb­ing spa­tial ex­pe­ri­ence,” says Mr Mok. “This ten­sion – reg­u­lar ver­sus ir­reg­u­lar, or­der­li­ness ver­sus play­ful­ness and the way the rich­ness of a space is de­signed to be con­cealed and dis­cov­ered – fas­ci­nates me to this day.”</p>
    <p>He cred­its his men­tor Mr Lim with fir­ing his imag­i­na­tion through his early Modernist works of the 1960s to 1970s, to the Post­mod­ernism of the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok fur­ther ex­pands his</p>
    <p>reper­toire with his own takes on Neo-Modernism in the 352-page tome, Mok Wei Wei: Works By W Ar­chi­tects, pre­fer­ring to con­stantly move with the times.</p>
    <p>He says his early ex­po­sure to Chi­nese lit­er­ary and aes­thetic val­ues pro­vided a start­ing point for con­tin­u­ing ex­plo­rations. He cites The Story Of The Stone, also known as Dream Of The Red Cham­ber, by Cao Xue­qin as a cre­ative re­source. The tale chron­i­cles the glory and de­cline of an il­lus­tri­ous Chi­nese fam­ily.</p>
    <p>In 1983 and on a trip with his men­tor to the United States and Ja­pan, he met Pritzker Prizewin­ning ar­chi­tect Frank Gehry, who stud­ied with Mr Lim at Har­vard Univer­sity in 1957.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can ar­chi­tect in­flu­enced some of the works that Mr Lim and Mr Mok worked on in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim formed De­sign Part­ner­ship (to­day’s DP Ar­chi­tects) in 1967 with Mr Tay Kheng Soon and Mr Koh Seow Chuan, af­ter Sin­ga­pore achieved in­de­pen­dence in 1965.</p>
    <p>In 1972, Mr Lim headed the team that de­signed one of the fledg­ling na­tion’s first Modernist icons, Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex, the first of its kind in South-east Asia and which be­came a model for com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>He then worked on Woh Hup Com­plex in 1974, which was re­named Golden Mile Tow­ers in the 1980s. In 1981, he formed Wil­liam Lim As­so­ci­ates (WLA) with Mr Mok, Mr Richard Ho and Mr Carl Lar­son.</p>
    <p>When Mr Lim re­tired in 2003, Mr Mok took on a new part­ner, Mr Ng Weng Pan, and re­named the firm W Ar­chi­tects.</p>
    <p>In a rare in­ter­view with The Straits Times on Wed­nes­day, Mr Lim com­ments on his pro­tege’s de­signs, from his airy sun-bathed liv­ing room in a con­do­minium in Hol­land Road.</p>
    <p>The cosy apart­ment is cu­rated with Dan­ish mid-cen­tury mod­ern clas­sic fur­ni­ture and fea­tures works by pioneer Sin­ga­pore artists on the walls such as Chen Wen Hsi and Cheong Soo Pieng. A por­trait of Mr Lim by founder of Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts, Brother Joseph McNally, takes pride of place in the cen­tre of the hall.</p>
    <p>“The qual­ity of his work is con­sis­tently high... es­pe­cially his ap­proach to con­ser­va­tion, like the Vic­to­ria Con­cert Hall pro­ject,” says the 88-year-old.</p>
    <p>Mr Mok’s im­bib­ing of East­ern and Western de­sign philoso­phies un­der­girds many of the works show­cased in the book by Thames & Hud­son, which has in the past mainly pub­lished works by Euro­pean and North Amer­i­can ar­chi­tects.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has of­fices in Sin­ga­pore, Hong Kong and Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Mr Lu­cas Di­et­rich, in­ter­na­tional ed­i­to­rial direc­tor of the 70-year-old fam­ily-owned pub­lish­ing house, first talked to Mr Mok about work­ing on the firm’s mono­graph in 2017.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery sin­gle pro­ject, large or small, that Wei Wei fo­cuses on is uniquely im­por­tant,” says Mr Di­et­rich. “But what con­tin­u­ally i mpresses me is the to­tal­ity of his cor­pus, the way in which his work has both re­sponded to in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ments in ar­chi­tec­ture over the past four decades yet made it par­tic­u­lar to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The book doc­u­ments the firm’s jour­ney i n three parts: Refract, Re­spond and Reflect.</p>
    <p>The first chap­ter, Refract, de­tails Mr Mok’s search for cre­ative di­rec­tions from the early 1980s, in­clud­ing sev­eral col­lab­o­ra­tions with his men­tor at WLA such as Bu Ye Tian in 1982, a con­cept pro­posal for the re­ju­ve­na­tion of the Sin­ga­pore River; and Tampines North Com­mu­nity Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>He also ref­er­ences the works of Sin­ga­pore’s liv­ing pioneer ar­chi­tects of the Modernist move­ment, namely Datuk Seri Lim Chong Keat and Mr Al­fred Wong, both 90; Mr Tan Cheng Siong, 83; and Mr Tay Kheng Soon, 80.</p>
    <p>The next stage, Re­spond, is about con­text. He asks ex­is­ten­tial ques­tions such as, “How do you think big when you are liv­ing on a land­scarce is­land?”</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal chap­ter, he con­tem­plates the sense of self that roots an ar­chi­tect to a na­tional iden­tity yet is not con­strict­ing.</p>
    <p>For a younger gen­er­a­tion of ar­chi­tects such as Mr Jonathan Poh, 40, an ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore Her­itage So­ci­ety, Mr Mok’s book is timely in con­tin­u­ing the con­ver­sa­tions that are cen­tred on con­serv­ing Modernist land­marks such as Golden Mile Com­plex, and not los­ing more icons of early na­tion-build­ing such as Pearl Bank Apart­ments.</p>
    <p>“We are heart­ened and glad to have Wei Wei as a strong pro­po­nent of con­serv­ing our mod­ern built her­itage,” says Mr Poh, who runs his own ar­chi­tec­tural prac­tice Pro­volk Ar­chi­tects.</p>
    <p>The her­itage so­ci­ety re­leased a po­si­tion pa­per in 2018, ti­tled Too Young To Die: Giv­ing New Lease Of Life To Sin­ga­pore’s Modernist Icons, ad­vo­cat­ing plan­ning in­cen­tives for de­vel­op­ers and build­ing own­ers, such as of­fer­ing more gross floor area and more flex­i­ble re-zon­ing op­tions, to stop the wreck­ing ball.</p>
    <p>“Young ar­chi­tects like my­self have looked up to Mr Mok’s gen­er­a­tion, who have been men­tored per­son­ally by post-in­de­pen­dence pioneers, and have de­vel­oped their body of work to be one of ex­cel­lence and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“Mr Mok’s in­flu­ence within the built en­vi­ron­ment com­mu­nity has def­i­nitely bol­stered sup­port in re­cent ef­forts to con­serve prom­i­nent Modernist land­marks like Golden Mile Com­plex.</p>
    <p>“We def­i­nitely hope his new book will spur many to re­think adap­tive re­use of ex­ist­ing Modernist build­ings as also one way of pro­mot­ing sus­tain­able devel­op­ment that in the long run is ben­e­fi­cial for the en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
