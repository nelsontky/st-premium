    <p>By all ac­counts, it was a rough 2020 for Ar­se­nal fan James But­ler. The Gun­ners suf­fered their worst start to a top-flight sea­son in 46 years. Worse was to come though for the 36-year-old Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, af­ter he learnt that his father Wil­liam’s can­cer had re­lapsed back in Hert­ford­shire, Eng­land.</p>
    <p>To com­pli­cate mat­ters fur­ther, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has made trav­el­ling dif­fi­cult, es­pe­cially when his Sin­ga­porean wife Tri­cia Li is due next month.</p>
    <p>Some good news fi­nally ar­rived thanks to the Pre­mier League club and their shirt spon­sor Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Last month, But­ler thought he was on a video call with Ar­se­nal’s pitch-side presenter Nigel Mitchell to share his per­sonal story, when the lat­ter called for tech­ni­cal sup­port. A few mo­ments later, goal­keeper Bernd Leno and mid­fielder Granit Xhaka popped up on the screen, leav­ing But­ler and Li stunned.</p>
    <p>But­ler, a mar­ket­ing direc­tor at a cy­ber se­cu­rity firm, told The Straits Times on Satur­day: “The video call did lag so call­ing for tech sup­port sounded legit, and I wasn’t ex­pect­ing play­ers, much less two first-team play­ers, to come on.</p>
    <p>“I was shocked, but in a very happy and pos­i­tive way.”</p>
    <p>The sur­prise was part of Emi­rates’ ini­tia­tive with part­ner clubs Ar­se­nal, Real Madrid and AC Mi­lan to en­gage with com­mu­ni­ties around the world.</p>
    <p>But­ler was nom­i­nated by the Ar­se­nal Sin­ga­pore Sup­port­ers Club and the But­lers also re­ceived Emi­rates flight and match tick­ets to watch the Gun­ners.</p>
    <p>“Nor­mally, my par­ents would fly out here once ev­ery year, and they would have def­i­nitely come to see their first grand­child,” he said. “The good news is that my dad is get­ting bet­ter with chemo­ther­apy and im­munother­apy. We are very thank­ful for the sur­prise and are look­ing for­ward to bring­ing our baby to visit my mum and dad soon.”</p>
    <p>Ar­se­nal also en­tered the new year on a high af­ter end­ing their seven-game win­less streak by beat­ing Chelsea 3-1 and fol­lowed up with away wins at Brighton (1-0) and West Bromwich (4-0).</p>
    <p>But­ler, a Gun­ners fan for 30 years, said: “There have been ups and downs, but we stick with them through thick and thin.</p>
    <p>“Bernd and Granit said they have a lot of re­spect for fans in Sin­ga­pore who stay up to watch them play and asked for con­tin­ued sup­port, and we will do just that.”</p>
