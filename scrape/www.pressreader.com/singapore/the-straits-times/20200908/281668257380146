    <p>Places which have kept coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions largely un­der con­trol lead the way in eas­ing re­stric­tions on busi­ness events like con­fer­ences and trade shows.</p>
    <p>Many, how­ever, still stip­u­late a limit on the max­i­mum num­ber of at­ten­dees at these events, and im­pose hy­giene and safety pro­ce­dures such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing, tem­per­a­ture scan­ning, mask wear­ing and con­tact­less regis­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia</p>
    <p>Meet­ings, work­shops and con­ven­tions have been al­lowed in Malaysia since July 1, ac­cord­ing to trade pub­li­ca­tion TTGmice. Ini­tially, at­ten­dance was capped at 250 peo­ple and the events could take place only in green zone ar­eas, which are dis­tricts with no ac­tive Covid-19 cases. The limit on num­bers was lifted on July 15, with or­gan­is­ers just re­quired to en­sure that at­ten­dees could be dis­tanced at least 1m apart at the event venue.</p>
    <p>Ger­many</p>
    <p>Each of Ger­many’s 16 states has been free since June to de­ter­mine when and on what con­di­tions they wish to al­low busi­ness events to re­sume.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to event in­tel­li­gence plat­form Even­tMB, Ber­lin city has ap­plied a stag­gered sys­tem with only up to 300 at­ten­dees al­lowed in July, and 500 at­ten­dees last month. This limit was raised to 750 peo­ple this month and will be raised fur­ther to 1,000 peo­ple next month.</p>
    <p>The states of Baden-Wurt­tem­berg, Bavaria and Lower Sax­ony, how­ever, de­cided to re­open the sec­tor only this month.</p>
    <p>China</p>
    <p>China, where the coro­n­avirus was first de­tected late last year, re­opened its busi­ness events sec­tor in May. While there is no limit on the num­ber of peo­ple who can at­tend, safety re­quire­ments such as face masks, proper ven­ti­la­tion and dis­in­fec­tion must be ad­hered to.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan</p>
    <p>Tai­wan, which has recorded just 494 cases and seven deaths from the pan­demic, restarted its do­mes­tic busi­ness events sec­tor in June. There are no manda­tory safety re­quire­ments or limit on the size of gath­er­ings, with event or­gan­is­ers free to de­cide if at­ten­dees should wear face masks or main­tain a safe dis­tance.</p>
