    <p>THE WITCHES PG, 105 min­utes, opens to­day,</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood loves the chil­dren’s writ­ing of Roald Dahl, but doesn’t love their trade­mark anx­i­ety and low-key ma­li­cious­ness.</p>
    <p>In his world, kids who worry that some adults hate them as a species are proven cor­rect. Step out of line even a lit­tle and grotesque pun­ish­ments await.</p>
    <p>The urge to sani­tise has scrubbed this adap­ta­tion of the 1983 novel clean of any­thing me­morable. It is at best a perky but for­get­table kid’s ad­ven­ture and, at worst, an un­nec­es­sary up­date of the 1990 film ver­sion.</p>
    <p>The name­less Hero Boy (Jahzir Bruno, with Chris Rock tak­ing over his voice as an adult) is an or­phan, housed with Grandma (Oc­tavia Spencer) in her Alabama home. There are flash­backs to her youth when an early en­counter with witches gave her a life­long wari­ness of them.</p>
    <p>Thus fore­warned, the boy meets a congress of them in a fancy ho­tel. Through a lec­ture de­liv­ered by the Grand High Witch (Anne Hath­away), he learns of their plot to turn all chil­dren into mice so un­wit­ting adults can kill them.</p>
    <p>It ap­pears that the pri­mary rea­son for the re­make – the same rea­son that drives Dis­ney to re­make its an­i­ma­tion fea­tures as live-ac­tion movies – is tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Modern com­puter graph­ics can do a lot, as Charlie And The Choco­late Fac­tory (2005) showed. It was di­rec­tor Tim Bur­ton’s take on a Dahl book that a gen­er­a­tion ago was adapted into the much-loved Willy Wonka And The Choco­late Fac­tory (1971).</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Robert Ze­meckis is known to be nutty for vis­ual ef­fects (the fan­tasy Be­owulf, 2007 and the ad­ven­ture The Po­lar Ex­press, 2004) so he ap­pears to be a nat­u­ral fit for a romp filled with talk­ing an­i­mals and hideous en­chantresse­s.</p>
    <p>An­jel­ica Hus­ton, the High Witch in the 1990 ver­sion, talked about how the three-hour ses­sions needed to ap­ply her witchy fa­cial pros­thet­ics left her in tears.</p>
    <p>The only tears to be shed this time might come from those seated in cin­e­mas. Hath­away and Ze­meckis opted to give her a Slavic ac­cent from 1970s car­toons, a campy touch at odds with the rest of the pic­ture, which strives for tear-jerk­ing Alabama earth­i­ness. That is, when it is not des­per­ately showing off what can be done with fran­ti­cally scam­per­ing com­puter-drawn crea­tures.</p>
    <p>A vis­ual tour de force per­haps but emo­tion­ally, about as deep as a layer of pix­els on a mon­i­tor.</p>
    <p>WAIT­ING FOR THE BAR­BAR­IANS NC16, 114 min­utes, opens to­day</p>
    <p>The 1980 novel on which this work is based was writ­ten by J.M. Coet­zee. It tells of a name­less Mag­is­trate, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of an un­named Em­pire deal­ing with bar­bar­ians of the ti­tle who prowl its fron­tier.</p>
    <p>Stripped of the specifics of his­tory and cul­ture – the Em­pire might be Bri­tish, French or</p>
    <p>Bel­gian, the bar­bar­ians the indige­nous of Africa, the Mid­dle East, the Amer­i­cas, Aus­tralia or South-east Asia – im­pe­ri­al­ism is ex­posed for the bru­tal­is­ing, in­glo­ri­ous ex­pe­ri­ence it truly is.</p>
    <p>As in the book, the film opens with the Mag­is­trate (Mark Ry­lance, giv­ing a stel­lar per­for­mance), a bu­reau­crat in charge of a sleepy out­post on the edge of civil­i­sa­tion. The time pe­riod looks to be the 19th cen­tury. Colonel Joll (Johnny Depp, with a steely glare and set jaw), a vis­i­tor from the cap­i­tal, is taken aback by the Mag­is­trate’s pol­icy of peace­ful co-ex­is­tence, be­liev­ing the tribal peo­ple will see it as weak­ness. Joll’s tougher stance in­cludes the use of tor­ture.</p>
    <p>The novel on which the film is based might be post­mod­ern in how peo­ple and places are name­less and there­fore uni­ver­salised, but its frame­work, car­ried over in the film, feels trag­i­cally out of date in 2020.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it is the Mag­is­trate’s point of view that dominates when a name­less tribal woman (Mon­go­lian ac­tress and model Gana Ba­yar­saikhan) is, as they say, right there. She serves as the mute ves­sel for his kind­ness. The en­light­ened bu­reau­crat recog­nises her hu­man­ity, a habit that fills di­nosaurs like Joll and his lieu­tenant Man­del (Robert Pat­tin­son) with dis­gust. They view him as yet another of their kind who has “gone na­tive”, a mas­ter who has sul­lied him­self by con­sort­ing in public with a slave mis­tress.</p>
    <p>There is the usual Heart Of Dark­ness-Apoc­a­lypse Now mes­sage, with the real bar­bar­ians ap­pear­ing to be the men with guns and uni­forms. Be­yond that ob­vi­ous ref­er­ence, not much else is ap­par­ent. With the sav­ages es­tab­lished as uni­formly no­ble and the im­pe­ri­al­ists as nu­anced in char­ac­ter and moral­ity (and ca­pa­ble of be­com­ing white saviours, if they choose), this cau­tion­ary tale of colo­nial hubris de­scends into con­tra­dic­tion, or at least, in­co­her­ence.</p>
    <p>The tal­ented Colom­bian di­rec­tor Ciro Guerra, who helmed the ex­cel­lent moder­nity-ver­sus­folk­ways dra­mas Birds Of Pas­sage (2018) and Em­brace Of The Ser­pent (2015), can­not save this.</p>
    <p>The film is an anti-Rud­yard Ki­pling story that wants to tear down the Em­pire-lov­ing writer’s ro­man­ti­cised no­tions of non-Western cul­tures, but does not quite know how.</p>
    <p>THE SILENT FOR­EST M18, 108 min­utes, opens to­day, not re­viewed</p>
    <p>Nom­i­nated for eight Golden Horse Awards this year, this Tai­wanese thriller based on a true story fea­tures Liu Tzu-chuan and Buffy Chen as stu­dents in a school for the hear­ing im­paired. Chang Cheng (Liu) is a new stu­dent who is shocked to dis­cover a cul­ture of abuse that no one is will­ing to ac­knowl­edge, much less ad­mit ex­ists.</p>
    <p>VOICE OF SI­LENCE PG13, 99 min­utes, opens to­day, not re­viewed</p>
    <p>Hong Eui-jeong makes her di­rec­to­rial fea­ture de­but with this indie South Korean crime drama, which she also wrote. Yoo Ah-in and You Chea-myung play crime scene clean­ers who are dragged into a case in­volv­ing a kid­napped child.</p>
    <p>Hong’s screen­play was picked for developmen­t at the Sun­dance Screen­writ­ers Lab and also made the top 12 list of projects at the Venice Bi­en­nale Col­lege-Cin­ema in 2016.</p>
