    <p>Malaysia has missed its tar­get of be­ing a de­vel­oped econ­omy by last year, with its progress ham­pered by graft, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and in­come in­equal­ity, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>Achiev­ing high-in­come sta­tus was one of nine ob­jec­tives set out in the Vi­sion 2020 plan – the road map in­tro­duced in 1991 by then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad to im­prove the coun­try. Most of the re­main­ing tar­gets fo­cused on so­cial val­ues, such as be­com­ing a more fair and tol­er­ant so­ci­ety, as well as one that is more demo­cratic and com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists say that while Malaysia is not far from cross­ing the high-in­come thresh­old, it has re­gressed in terms of en­sur­ing an equal dis­tri­bu­tion of wealth – another key eco­nomic in­di­ca­tor of the pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Vi­sion 2020 aimed for an av­er­age of 7 per cent an­nual growth in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP), which would have trans­lated to an econ­omy worth RM1.9 tril­lion (S$623 bil­lion) by last year, tak­ing into ac­count in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s cur­rent GDP stands at RM1.34 tril­lion, but it did reach a high of RM1.45 tril­lion be­fore the pan­demic bat­tered the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Yeah Kim Leng of Sun­way Univer­sity said Malaysia is cur­rently only 10.4 per cent short of reach­ing the high-in­come GDP per capita thresh­old of US$12,535 (S$16,582) set by the World Bank. He ex­pects the coun­try to reach this fig­ure within four years, based on its cur­rent tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Yeah pointed out that Malaysia’s pur­chas­ing power par­ity per capita had in­creased by 20 per­cent­age points in the past 40 years when com­pared with the world’s largest econ­omy, the United States. How­ever, he noted that other Asian economies had out­per­formed Malaysia in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“It (in­come level) also pales in com­par­i­son with the spec­tac­u­lar growth achieved by two out­per­form­ers, South Korea and Sin­ga­pore. South Korea, which had a lower per capita in­come than Malaysia and only 17.2 per cent of the US’ in 1980, rose to 70.2 per cent in 2020, a gain of 53.1 per­cent­age points over the four decades. Sin­ga­pore’s gain is even more im­pres­sive, ris­ing from 70 per cent to 151.6 per cent of US in­come per capita in­come... over the same pe­riod,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Malaysia ranks well on life ex­pectancy, ed­u­ca­tion and per capita in­come, scor­ing 0.81 on the United Na­tions’ Hu­man De­vel­op­ment In­dex (HDI). Ac­cord­ing to Prof Yeah, a 0.8 score on the HDI would denote a de­vel­oped econ­omy, but the coun­try lacks ad­vanced tech­no­log­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture – a key de­ter­mi­nant for de­vel­oped sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, wealth dis­tri­bu­tion has wors­ened re­cently, de­spite marginally im­prov­ing in the early years of Vi­sion 2020.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s in­come equal­ity, mea­sured us­ing the Gini co­ef­fi­cient, is higher than the av­er­age re­ported by coun­tries with sim­i­lar HDI rank­ings. It had a 0.45 score in 1990, which im­proved to 0.399 in 2016, but climbed back up to 0.407 in 2019. A higher score de­notes less equal­ity.</p>
    <p>“Among the 52 coun­tries with HDI scores higher than 0.8 that re­port the Gini co­ef­fi­cient... Malaysia’s score of 0.41 is higher than the group av­er­age of 0.33,” Prof Yeah said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s re­form ef­forts were also ham­pered by a se­ries of eco­nomic shocks, such as the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis and the on­go­ing pan­demic, which have forced the gov­ern­ment to pump-prime the econ­omy, said Bank Is­lam chief econ­o­mist Afzanizam Ab­dul Rashid.</p>
    <p>Dr Afzanizam also said that a trust deficit in how the coun­try has been ad­min­is­tered, par­tic­u­larly since the 2015 bil­lion-dol­lar graft scan­dal sur­round­ing state fund 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had, has made eco­nomic re­forms more dif­fi­cult. Tack­ling corruption is key, he said.</p>
    <p>Still, he said, Malaysia has emerged as mar­ket leader in sev­eral sec­tors, such as avi­a­tion, glove mak­ing and Is­lamic fi­nance.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps fo­cus­ing too much on fi­nan­cial or ma­te­rial gains may have ob­scured how we de­fine suc­cess. And along the way, it breeds greed and ul­ti­mately corruption,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a new plan has been rolled out to take over from Vi­sion 2020. Launched in 2019, again by Tun Dr Ma­hathir dur­ing his se­cond stint as prime min­is­ter, the Shared Pros­per­ity Vi­sion 2030 aims to cre­ate a more eq­ui­table econ­omy and make Malaysia the eco­nomic cen­tre of Asia by 2030.</p>

    <p>DR AFZANIZAM AB­DUL RASHID, Bank Is­lam chief econ­o­mist, who said that eco­nomic re­forms in Malaysia have been made more dif­fi­cult by a trust deficit in how the coun­try has been ad­min­is­tered, and that tack­ling corruption is key.</p>
