    <p>Yeng Pway Ngon, one of Sin­ga­pore’s most em­i­nent Chi­nese-lan­guage writ­ers, died yes­ter­day after a long bat­tle with can­cer – 16 days shy of his 74th birth­day.</p>
    <p>The Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent and three-time Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize win­ner wrote more than 20 works, in­clud­ing ac­claimed nov­els such as Un­rest (2002), Triv­i­al­i­ties About Me And My­self (2006) and Art Stu­dio (2011).</p>
    <p>The lat­ter two were se­lected by the jour­nal Asia Weekly for its pres­ti­gious an­nual list of the 10 Best Chi­nese Nov­els in the World, along­side works by No­bel lau­re­ate Mo Yan and Yan Gel­ing.</p>
    <p>Yeng had bat­tled prostate can­cer since 2007 and later de­vel­oped colon can­cer. In May last year, he was di­ag­nosed with pan­cre­atic can­cer. He un­der­went surgery, but later fell sick from un­sta­ble blood su­gar lev­els. By last month, the can­cer had spread to his whole body.</p>
    <p>His wife Goh Beng Choo, 68, who was also his long-time trans­la­tor, said that in his last days, he did not suf­fer much. He leaves his wife, their daugh­ter and two grand­sons.</p>
    <p>“He was strong in spirit,” she said. “He en­dured pain since the day he had prostate can­cer 14 years ago and never let it af­fect the qual­ity of his writ­ing. He was al­ways telling me about the ideas he had for new sto­ries and poems. I am sad he did not live longer to cre­ate more good works.”</p>
    <p>Yeng’s pass­ing was mourned by many in the lo­cal arts and lit­er­ary scene. Singer-song­writer Liang Wern Fook wrote a trib­ute poem in Chi­nese on Face­book, ref­er­enc­ing Yeng’s de­but novel A Man Like Me (1987): “Some say this is a desert/ A man like him/ leaves be­hind deep foot­prints all the way to the hori­zon of lit­er­a­ture.”</p>
    <p>Poet Alvin Pang, 48, who worked with Madam Goh to trans­late some of Yeng’s poetry into English, called him “one of the great in­no­va­tors of Sin­ga­porean Chi­nese lit­er­a­ture” and “one of the very few writ­ers any­where who ex­celled across gen­res – poetry, fiction and the­atre”.</p>
    <p>Mr Fong Hoe Fang, 66, founder of Ethos Books, which pub­lished some of Yeng’s poetry in English through its af­fil­i­ate, The Lit­er­ary Cen­tre, said: “The gen­tle­ness and in­tegrity of his per­son­al­ity in­formed his writ­ing, which sought a highly nu­anced un­der­stand­ing of so­ci­ety with­out com­pro­mis­ing the need for dig­nity and so­cial jus­tice.”</p>
    <p>Yeng’s ac­co­lades in­clude the South-east Asia Write Award. In 2018, he was hon­oured at the Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val with an ex­hi­bi­tion on his “deeply ex­is­ten­tial and univer­sal” works.</p>
    <p>Many of his nov­els bal­ance pro­found psy­cho­log­i­cal por­traits with in­sight into mo­ments of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory. Un­rest drew on his own de­ten­tion in 1977 un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act for al­leged left­ist sym­pa­thies. He drew on his strug­gle with prostate can­cer to write his 500-page epic novel Art Stu­dio (2011), which charts the lives of artists from the 1960s to the present. It was adapted for the stage as a three-hour play in 2017 by Nine Years The­atre.</p>
    <p>He founded iconic book­shop Grass­roots Book Room in 1975 and re­opened it after a hia­tus in 1995.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Wain Ching, 37, founder of book­shop City Book Room – which pub­lished some of Yeng’s fi­nal works – used to work at Grass­roots. Her for­mer boss was “hu­mor­ous, sin­cere and hard-work­ing”, she said, adding: “Even when he was sick, he still ran the book­store and shared his lit­er­a­ture jour­ney with many young au­thors there.”</p>
    <p>When Yeng de­cided to close Grass­roots, the book­shop was taken over in 2014 by three of his fans, who moved it to its cur­rent lo­ca­tion in Bukit Pa­soh Road.</p>
    <p>He did not stop writ­ing, and pub­lished Colour Of Dusk (2019) – a novel about a lonely, el­derly writer – and a poetry col­lec­tion, Stone (2020).</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who vis­ited him last Fri­day, re­called: “We played the songs that he liked, or ap­peared in his nov­els. He still joked with me. I re­mem­ber his charm­ing smile.”</p>
    <p>NU­ANCED LOOK AT SO­CI­ETY</p>
    <p>The gen­tle­ness and in­tegrity of his per­son­al­ity in­formed his writ­ing, which sought a highly nu­anced un­der­stand­ing of so­ci­ety with­out com­pro­mis­ing the need for dig­nity and so­cial jus­tice.</p>
    <p>MR FONG HOE FANG, 66, founder of Ethos Books, which pub­lished some of Yeng’s poetry in English.</p>
