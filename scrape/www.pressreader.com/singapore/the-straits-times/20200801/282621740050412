    <p>Size mat­ters in more ways than one to the 8-se­ries Gran Coupe, BMW’s new four-door tourer.</p>
    <p>Be­ing ap­pre­cia­bly longer, wider and taller than its two-door sib­ling, the car ex­udes a more com­mand­ing pres­ence. This strangely makes the four-door more wor­thy of the 8se­ries iconic name­plate.</p>
    <p>Its dimensions – 5,082mm by 1,932mm by 1,407mm tall – also make the 8er Gran Coupe big­ger than its keen­est ri­vals: the Mercedes-Benz CLS and Audi A7 Sport­back.</p>
    <p>Its wheel­base of 3,023mm is 201mm longer than the 8-se­ries Coupe’s, giv­ing the Gran Coupe li­mou­sine-like quar­ters for rear pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>At 1,627mm, its front track is as wide as the two-door’s. But its rear track is 28mm wider at 1,671mm – mak­ing it the widest of any BMW.</p>
    <p>The car’s in­creased height comes from more up­right A-pil­lars. This cre­ates more head­room, but does not di­min­ish the car’s over­all sleek­ness or its dy­namic stance be­cause of its in­creased length and width.</p>
    <p>Whether stand­ing still or on the move, this 8er turns heads like a glis­ten­ing stal­lion. It is rare for a four-door to out­shine a two-door, but this car man­ages to do just that.</p>
    <p>Size, how­ever, usu­ally comes with sig­nif­i­cant per­for­mance penal­ties. But the 840i GC tested here holds its own pretty well. It takes 5.2 sec­onds to reach 100kmh, ver­sus five sec­onds for the 840i Coupe.</p>
    <p>Ve­loc­ity for both cars is capped at 250kmh. The four-door is a mite thirstier, con­sum­ing 7.9 litres/ 100km ver­sus the Coupe’s 7.7 litres/100km. The test car, how­ever, clocked 13 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>It is in the han­dling de­part­ment that the Gran Coupe falls short of the Coupe’s. Its size and vastly ex­tended wheel­base make it more suited for long, straight hauls.</p>
    <p>This does not mean the four-door is sloppy around bends. It is still grace­ful and con­fi­dent com­pared with many oth­ers, with a keen steer­ing re­sponse and a neat turn-in. But it is just not as crisp and snappy as the Coupe.</p>
    <p>This is well com­pen­sated by a bet­ter ride qual­ity. The ride is firm yet com­fort­able, un­der­scor­ing the car’s un­de­ni­ably sporty stance.</p>
    <p>It dis­ap­points only when it en­coun­ters larger im­per­fec­tions, such as ex­pan­sion gaps, some­times with jud­ders which slightly rat­tle the driver’s door panel.</p>
    <p>But over­all, on an un­end­ing stretch of well-paved tar­mac, the Gran Coupe is a cred­itable mode of travel, es­pe­cially for rear oc­cu­pants.</p>
    <p>Its cabin is i mmac­u­lately fin­ished. In its class, the car’s med­ley of glass, ve­neer and l eather is sec­ond to none. It has the lat­est tech, with the nifti­est be­ing an adap­tive cruise con­trol which de­tects the type of ve­hi­cles in front of it and rep­re­sent­ing them on the in­stru­men­ta­tion screen.</p>
    <p>Where it mat­ters, the 8er Gran Coupe ex­cels. Its throt­tle re­sponse is won­der­fully lin­ear, with ac­cel­er­a­tion that is of­ten ac­com­pa­nied by a creamy com­bi­na­tion of wind and per­cus­sion notes.</p>
    <p>And you do not even have to drive hard to en­joy this bal­lad of com­bus­tion, with sound and fury al­ways sig­ni­fy­ing speed and ex­hil­a­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The joys of a bal­anced and size­able in­line-six paired with a sup­port­ive trans­mis­sion and a well­tuned ex­haust are not to be taken for granted. Es­pe­cially now, when ev­ery other new car is either elec­tri­fied or pow­ered by en­gines which are just too small.</p>
    <p>The 8-se­ries Gran Coupe’s im­mense pres­ence and el­e­gant sil­hou­ette only heighten the plea­sure.</p>
