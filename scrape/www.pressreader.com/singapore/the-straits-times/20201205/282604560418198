    <p>LON­DON • Olivier Giroud’s re­cent per­for­mances have given Frank Lam­pard food for thought but the Chelsea boss yes­ter­day said that it was dif­fi­cult to of­fer the French striker the as­sur­ance that he will spear­head their at­tack.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old has yet to start a Pre­mier League game this sea­son, with Timo Werner and Tammy Abra­ham pre­ferred over him, and Les Bleus coach Di­dier Deschamps urged the striker to sort out his club fu­ture ahead of Euro 2020 next year.</p>
    <p>Giroud un­der­lined his im­por­tance in the Cham­pi­ons League on Wed­nes­day when he scored all of Chelsea’s goals in a 4-0 de­mo­li­tion of Sevilla.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a case of giv­ing play­ers re­as­sur­ances over game time, it’s dif­fi­cult to do. You want play­ers out of the team to train well and per­form,” Lam­pard said ahead of to­day’s home game against Leeds.</p>
    <p>“It gives me nice prob­lems... Play­ing like the other night,</p>
    <p>clearly, (Giroud) will get plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter a mixed start to the sea­son, Chelsea are third in the stand­ings – two points be­hind lead­ers Tot­ten­ham – and can go top with a win to­day.</p>
    <p>They have scored a joint league­high 22 goals in 10 games and Lam­pard said his squad are bond­ing af­ter the club spent over £220 mil­lion (S$395.5 mil­lion) in a clos­esea­son re­build.</p>
    <p>“It takes con­sis­tency. We’re play­ing well but we can get bet­ter for sure,” he added.</p>
    <p>“There will be tests along the way when play­ers play well and aren’t in the team the next match be­cause of com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Pep Guardi­ola re­vealed he had no new in­jury con­cerns other than Ser­gio Aguero, who will miss Manch­ester City’s home game against Ful­ham to­day.</p>
    <p>The striker re­turned to light train­ing ear­lier this week but the Spa­niard con­firmed the Cot­tagers clash will come too soon for him.</p>
    <p>This will be Guardi­ola’s 700th game in the dugout and although most pun­dits ex­pect City to brush aside their op­po­nents, 17th-placed Ful­ham have shown more fight in re­cent games, no­tably up­set­ting Le­ices­ter last week.</p>
    <p>“I’ll do 700 more then re­tire. I never ex­pected it,” the Spa­niard said. “It’s a great num­ber.”</p>
