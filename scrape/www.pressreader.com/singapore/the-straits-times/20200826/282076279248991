    <p>An e-scooter rider was sen­tenced to two weeks’ jail yes­ter­day af­ter crash­ing into a pedes­trian last year.</p>
    <p>Rizam Kamil, 30, had pleaded guilty to caus­ing griev­ous hurt by act­ing neg­li­gently.</p>
    <p>He was also or­dered to pay house­wife Balkis Nachiar $6,208 in com­pen­sa­tion for her med­i­cal care.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent hap­pened on Feb 13 last year at about 4.35pm, as the part-time GrabFood rider was hur­ry­ing to get to Toa Payoh Cen­tral for a per­sonal ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>Rizam was rid­ing his e-scooter along the open-air foot­path in front of Block 183 Toa Payoh Cen­tral and did not keep a proper look­out de­spite the pres­ence of pedes­tri­ans. His view was also par­tially ob­structed by sales dis­plays.</p>
    <p>At the time, e-scoot­ers were al­lowed on foot­paths, but had to ob­serve a speed limit of un­der 10kmh. It is not known how fast Rizam was trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>When Madam Nachiar, 48, stepped onto the foot­path, Rizam could not brake in time, col­lid­ing with her and caus­ing her to fall onto the ground.</p>
    <p>He stayed with her and called the po­lice.</p>
    <p>On the same day, she was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal where she was hos­pi­talised. She l ater un­der­went surgery for a tibia, or shin­bone, fracture and was dis­charged on Feb 18.</p>
    <p>De­spite gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies, Madam Nachiar racked up a bill of $6,208.84 as she also had to at­tend fol­low-up con­sul­ta­tions and phys­io­ther­apy ses­sions.</p>
    <p>The e-scooter was then not regis­tered with the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity and it was about 4kg too heavy and 30mm too wide.</p>
    <p>Rizam told the court yes­ter­day that he is the sole bread­win­ner and has two young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Not­ing this, the court of­fered him one week’s jail in de­fault of pay­ing Madam Nachiar.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing, District Judge Marvin Bay said such sen­tences are “the in­evitable ne­ces­sity to de­ter cul­pa­ble PMD (per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vice) users who cause se­ri­ous in­juries to hap­less pedes­tri­ans”.</p>
