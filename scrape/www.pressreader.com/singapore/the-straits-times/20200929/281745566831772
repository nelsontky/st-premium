    <p>JAKARTA • Trade unions in In­done­sia threat­ened yes­ter­day to stage a na­tional strike next month af­ter a par­lia­men­tary panel agreed to move ahead with pro­posed labour re­forms in Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s con­tro­ver­sial job cre­ation Bill.</p>
    <p>Global in­vestors are watch­ing closely to see that the Bill is not wa­tered down in par­lia­men­tary de­bates, as South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy tries to com­pete for man­u­fac­tur­ing in­vest­ment re­lo­cat­ing from China against the back­drop of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers held week­end meet­ings to wrap up de­bate so the Bill could be passed be­fore a Par­lia­ment re­cess on Oct 9.</p>
    <p>Trade unions are pre­par­ing for ral­lies this week and a na­tional strike by five mil­lion work­ers from Oct 6 to 8, to press their de­mand for the pro­posed labour changes to be dropped, a union leader said.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the na­tional strike, we will stop all pro­duc­tion pro­cesses,” Mr Said Iqbal, pres­i­dent of the Con­fed­er­a­tion of In­done­sia Trade Unions, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Unions and green groups have held sev­eral demon­stra­tions to protest against the Bill, al­though last week’s ral­lies were quite small.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the leg­is­la­tion com­mit­tee agreed to a cut in manda­tory sev­er­ance ben­e­fits paid by em­ploy­ers to 23 times monthly wages, ver­sus a max­i­mum of 32 times now, said Mr Fir­man Soe­bagyo, a law­maker of the Golkar party.</p>
    <p>But work­ers would still be el­i­gi­ble for the ex­ist­ing level and the gov­ern­ment would fund the dif­fer­ence, he added. The gov­ern­ment had sought to cut the max­i­mum to 19 times the monthly wage, say­ing the rules were too gen­er­ous and de­terred hir­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee also re­jected pro­pos­als to tie the min­i­mum wage only to eco­nomic growth and let labour-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries set their own wages, but backed pro­pos­als to cut manda­tory paid leave and al­low longer work hours.</p>
    <p>No­mura economist Euben Paracuelle­s called the com­mit­tee’s de­ci­sion a “sig­nif­i­cant wa­ter­ing down” of re­forms, say­ing that scrap­ping high sev­er­ance pay and set­ting min­i­mum wages in line with pro­duc­tiv­ity were the two most cru­cial changes needed.</p>
    <p>Al­though it would have been ideal for Par­lia­ment to pass all the pro­pos­als, a com­pro­mise was bet­ter than noth­ing at a time of ex­tra­or­di­nary eco­nomic chal­lenge, said OCBC economist Wel­lian Wi­ranto.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he warned that “the pas­sage does not look like a sure thing just yet, given the op­po­si­tion from the labour move­ment”, adding that fail­ure to pass a mean­ing­ful re­form would hurt In­done­sia’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed labour re­forms are part of a so-called “om­nibus” Bill of changes in more than 70 laws, to al­low Par­lia­ment to vote in a sin­gle swoop and speed re­forms.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion com­mit­tee must now ask min­is­ters to agree on its de­ci­sion, be­fore tak­ing the mea­sure to a vote. Panel chair­man Suprat­man Andi At­gas told Reuters such a meet­ing had yet to be set, as law­mak­ers put the fin­ish­ing touches on a fi­nal draft.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the leg­is­la­tion com­mit­tee agreed to a cut in manda­tory sev­er­ance ben­e­fits paid by em­ploy­ers to 23 times monthly wages, ver­sus a max­i­mum of 32 times now, said Mr Fir­man Soe­bagyo, a law­maker of the Golkar party. But work­ers would still be el­i­gi­ble for the ex­ist­ing level and the gov­ern­ment would fund the dif­fer­ence.</p>
