    <p>It is heart­en­ing that thou­sands of peo­ple are set to get match­ing sums of up to $600 a year to top up their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Re­tire­ment Ac­count. The move to help more older CPF mem­bers at­tain the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum and pro­vide them with re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy comes through the Matched Re­tire­ment Sav­ings Scheme, which will ben­e­fit about 440,000 peo­ple. They ac­count for about 53 per cent of CPF mem­bers aged be­tween 55 and 70. Any­one, in­clud­ing fam­ily mem­bers, em­ploy­ers or mem­bers of the com­mu­nity, can make top-ups to a per­son’s Re­tire­ment Ac­count. Each dol­lar of cash top-up will be matched by the Gov­ern­ment for the next five years, capped at $600 a year.</p>
    <p>The scheme draws at­ten­tion to about half of CPF mem­bers turn­ing 55 to­day who have yet to reach the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum. The match­ing grant by the Gov­ern­ment will en­cour­age them to save more with the CPF. It is a worth­while ges­ture be­cause it em­pha­sises the im­por­tance of re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy in an in­di­vid­ual’s life plans. The CPF is key to en­sur­ing that ad­e­quacy, along with up­hold­ing the in­fra­struc­ture of health­care, home own­er­ship, fam­ily pro­tec­tion and as­set en­hance­ment. Taken to­gether, these pro­vi­sions con­sti­tute a com­pre­hen­sive so­cial se­cu­rity sys­tem that is es­sen­tial for per­sonal fi­nan­cial and phys­i­cal well-be­ing in an af­flu­ent but ex­pen­sive so­ci­ety. Given the CPF’s at­trac­tive sav­ings in­ter­est rate, it makes sense to use that chan­nel to stretch the re­tire­ment dol­lar. Un­for­tu­nately, per­sonal cir­cum­stances some­times make it dif­fi­cult for Sin­ga­pore­ans to achieve the Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum. Here, even small amounts saved con­sis­tently can make a dif­fer­ence in the long run. Al­though the top-up scheme is not new, the lat­est ini­tia­tive is a wel­come ad­di­tion to it.</p>
    <p>The im­por­tance of re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy is am­pli­fied by Sin­ga­pore’s tran­si­tion to an age­ing so­ci­ety. One in two Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 65 to­day is ex­pected to live to the age of 85 and be­yond, and one in three is ex­pected to live to 90 and be­yond. CPF sav­ings can pro­vide them with a monthly in­come to meet their ba­sic liv­ing ex­penses in old age. Those on CPF Life will re­ceive a monthly pay­out for as long as they live. Sup­ple­mented by per­sonal sav­ings, af­ford­able homes that are fully paid up for on re­tire­ment, and suf­fi­cient sav­ings for fu­ture med­i­cal ex­penses in old age, the CPF of­fers peace of mind to the el­derly. That is an in­valu­able fea­ture of the qual­ity of life that they seek in their golden years.</p>
    <p>Even with the CPF around, the need for fi­nan­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity lies firmly with the in­di­vid­ual. Keep­ing dis­cre­tionary spend­ing within bounds dur­ing working lives, be­ing ju­di­cious in the pur­chase of homes, and tak­ing the need for a healthy lifestyle se­ri­ously of­fer pro­tec­tion from eco­nomic chal­lenges in old age.</p>
