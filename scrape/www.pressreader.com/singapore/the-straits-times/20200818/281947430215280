    <p>MINSK • Pres­i­dent Alexan­der Lukashenko of Be­larus said yes­ter­day he would be will­ing to hand over power af­ter a ref­er­en­dum, in an ap­par­ent bid to pacify mass protests and strikes that pose the big­gest chal­lenge to his 26 years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>He made the of­fer – which he in­sisted would not be de­liv­ered on while un­der pres­sure from pro­test­ers – af­ter ex­iled op­po­si­tion politi­cian Svet­lana Tikhanousk­aya said she was will­ing to lead the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In a sign of Mr Lukashenko’s grow­ing vul­ner­a­bil­ity, he faced heck­ling and chants of “step down” dur­ing a speech to work­ers at one of the large state-run in­dus­trial plants that are the pride of his Soviet-style eco­nomic model and core sup­port base.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has told Mr Lukashenko it is ready to pro­vide mil­i­tary help to Be­larus in the event of an ex­ter­nal threat.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko faces the threat of Euro­pean Union sanc­tions af­ter a bloody crack­down on protests fol­low­ing what demon­stra­tors say was his rigged re-elec­tion vic­tory last week. He de­nies los­ing, cit­ing official re­sults that gave him just over 80 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>He told work­ers there would be no new pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, some­thing the op­po­si­tion wants, un­til he was killed.</p>
    <p>He also of­fered to change the Con­sti­tu­tion, an ap­par­ent con­ces­sion that seems un­likely to sat­isfy pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>“We’ll put the changes to a ref­er­en­dum, and I’ll hand over my con­sti­tu­tional pow­ers. But not un­der pres­sure or be­cause of the street,” he said, in remarks quoted by the official Belta news agency.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I’m not a saint. You know my harsh side. I’m not eter­nal. But if you drag down the first pres­i­dent, you’ll drag down neigh­bour­ing coun­tries and all the rest.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in a video ad­dress from Lithua­nia, Ms Tikhanousk­aya urged se­cu­rity and law en­force­ment of­fi­cers to switch sides, say­ing they would be for­given if they did so now.</p>
    <p>“I am ready to take re­spon­si­bil­ity and act as a na­tional leader dur­ing this pe­riod,” she said.</p>
    <p>She called for the cre­ation of a le­gal mech­a­nism to en­sure that a new and fair pres­i­den­tial elec­tion could be held.</p>
    <p>Her video was re­leased as In­ter­fax re­ported that em­ploy­ees from the state broad­caster BT had gone on strike, af­ter sev­eral pre­sen­ters and staff pub­licly re­signed last week in sol­i­dar­ity with the pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>The broad­caster was show­ing re­runs yes­ter­day morn­ing be­fore is­su­ing a fresh news bul­letin. Videos on so­cial me­dia sug­gested BT had at one point aired footage of an empty stu­dio with white so­fas, and mu­sic play­ing.</p>
    <p>Reuters could not in­de­pen­dently con­firm that, and the broad­caster could not im­me­di­ately be reached for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of pro­test­ers marched in Minsk to a fac­tory that Mr Lukashenko flew to by he­li­copter to speak to strik­ing work­ers.</p>
    <p>He had a rough re­cep­tion. “Thanks, I’ve said ev­ery­thing. You can (con­tinue to) shout ‘step down,’” he said, af­ter strug­gling to be heard above de­mands that he quit. He then walked away as the crowd chanted “step down”.</p>
    <p>Me­dia out­let Tut.By re­ported that work­ers at Be­laruskali, one of the world’s largest potash pro­duc­ers, had also threat­ened to stop pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Tikhanousk­aya is a former English teacher who has be­come one of Be­larus’ lead­ing op­po­si­tion fig­ures.</p>
    <p>She fled abroad last week, say­ing it was for the safety of her chil­dren, but quickly be­gan re­leas­ing videos call­ing for anti-govern­ment protests to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>The un­rest has spread to those nor­mally seen as loyal to Mr Lukashenko, as work­ers from large state fac­to­ries staged walk­outs and some po­lice of­fi­cers, jour­nal­ists from state me­dia and an am­bas­sador also came out.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin said on Sun­day that Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin had told Mr Lukashenko Moscow was ready to as­sist Be­larus in ac­cor­dance with a col­lec­tive mil­i­tary pact if nec­es­sary, and that ex­ter­nal pres­sure was be­ing ap­plied to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union lead­ers will send a mes­sage of sol­i­dar­ity to Be­laru­sian pro­test­ers dur­ing an emer­gency video­con­fer­ence to­mor­row, and Bri­tain joined a cho­rus of West­ern con­dem­na­tion.</p>
