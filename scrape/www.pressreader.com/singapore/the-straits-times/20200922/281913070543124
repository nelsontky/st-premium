    <p>A poll con­ducted amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has found strong sup­port for global co­op­er­a­tion across 14 ad­vanced economies, with a ma­jor­ity be­liev­ing that co­op­er­at­ing more with other coun­tries would have re­duced the num­ber of in­fec­tions at home.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple also gen­er­ally ap­proved of the han­dling of the Covid-19 out­break by the United Na­tions and World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, ac­cord­ing to the poll re­leased to­day by the non-par­ti­san Pew Re­search Cen­tre, al­though there were large dif­fer­ences in at­ti­tudes driven by age and po­lit­i­cal lean­ings.</p>
    <p>Younger re­spon­dents and those who were more highly ed­u­cated were more likely to have pos­i­tive views of in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions, while the sup­port was strongly par­ti­san in some coun­tries, in­clud­ing the US.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, the re­sults of­fer a snap­shot of per­sist­ing sup­port for the UN, which turns 75 this year, along with some scep­ti­cism of its ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>Sup­port for co­op­er­a­tion rather than com­pe­ti­tion also re­mains the dom­i­nant view, al­beit one held less strongly by sup­port­ers of rightwing pop­ulist par­ties in Europe and Repub­li­cans in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple gen­er­ally agree it is im­por­tant to take other coun­tries’ in­ter­ests into ac­count when deal­ing with ma­jor in­ter­na­tional is­sues, even if it means mak­ing com­pro­mises,” the re­port’s au­thors wrote.</p>
    <p>From June to last month, re­searchers sur­veyed 14,000 adults in 14 top UN donor na­tions: Aus­tralia, Bel­gium, Canada, Den­mark, France, Ger­many, Italy, Ja­pan, the Nether­lands, South Korea, Spain, Swe­den, the United King­dom and the United States.</p>
    <p>Some 59 per cent said greater in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion would have low­ered Covid-19 case num­bers at home, while 36 per cent said no amount of co­op­er­a­tion would have re­duced the pan­demic’s im­pact in their coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, 58 per cent agree their coun­try should take into ac­count the in­ter­ests of other na­tions even if it means mak­ing com­pro­mises with them. But 40 per cent said their coun­try should fol­low its own in­ter­ests even in the face of strong dis­agree­ment from other na­tions.</p>
    <p>The survey found favourable, if mixed, views of the UN. About three-quar­ters of re­spon­dents said the UN pro­motes hu­man rights and peace, while two-thirds think it pro­motes eco­nomic devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>But just over half reckon it deals ef­fec­tively with global is­sues or cares about the needs of or­di­nary peo­ple, a find­ing in line with past polls that show doubts about mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions per­sist de­spite the pub­lic see­ing them favourably, said the Pew re­searchers.</p>
    <p>Views on mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and global co­op­er­a­tion were linked to ide­ol­ogy, with left-lean­ing re­spon­dents more likely than those on the ide­o­log­i­cal right to ap­prove of the WHO and UN, and say that coun­tries should act as part of a global community.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans were the most ide­o­log­i­cally di­vided. Some 90 per cent of lib­er­als favoured act­ing as part of a global community, against 56 per cent of con­ser­va­tives, the largest gap in all 14 na­tions sur­veyed.</p>
    <p>This di­vide was con­sis­tently present. Democrats were sig­nif­i­cantly more likely than Repub­li­cans to say that the UN ad­vances the in­ter­ests of Amer­ica, in line with their much higher ap­proval of the UN. This year, 85 per cent of Democrats are pos­i­tive on the UN, against 39 per cent of Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>On the pan­demic, 83 per cent of those who lean Demo­crat said the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in Amer­ica would have been lower if the US co­op­er­ated more with other coun­tries, com­pared with 27 per cent of Repub­li­can-lean­ing re­spon­dents.</p>
    <p>Some 68 per cent of Repub­li­cans and in­de­pen­dent vot­ers who lean Repub­li­can said the US should fol­low its own in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar in­cli­na­tions were seen in Europe, where right-wing pop­ulist party sup­port­ers were more likely to favour their coun­try fol­low­ing its own in­ter­ests even when other coun­tries strongly dis­agree.</p>
