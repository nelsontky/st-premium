    <p>TOKYO Ja­pan’s ex­ports fell last month at the slow­est pace in seven months as US-bound ve­hi­cle ship­ments rose from l ows brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic, in­di­cat­ing eas­ing pres­sure on the world’s third-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial data yes­ter­day showed ex­ports fell 4.9 per cent in Septem­ber against the same month a year ear­lier, more than the 2.4 per cent econ­o­mists fore­cast in a Reuters poll.</p>
    <p>Still, the slower pace of de­cline fol­lowed six months of dou­ble-digit falls, in­clud­ing a 14.8 per cent drop in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>A fall in ex­ports of iron to Tai­wan and ships to Panama left Septem­ber mark­ing the 22nd con­sec­u­tive month of ex­port de­cline, the long­est run since the 23-month stretch through July 1987.</p>
    <p>To help the econ­omy through the coro­n­avirus cri­sis, the gov­ern­ment should com­pile a third ex­tra bud­get for the cur­rent fis­cal year, econ­o­mists told Reuters last week.</p>
    <p>The two ear­lier bud­gets helped fund US$2.2 tril­lion (S$3 tril­lion) in eco­nomic stim­u­lus, such as cash pay­ments to house­holds and small busi­ness loans.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga plans to or­der his gov­ern­ment to com­pile another stim­u­lus plan as early as next month, to sup­port con­sumer sen­ti­ment at risk from a new wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tion, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Still, the slow­ing de­cline in ex­ports adds to other signs of grad­ual eco­nomic re­cov­ery such as a pickup in fac­tory out­put.</p>
    <p>“Pro­duc­tion has re­cov­ered sub­stan­tially, but as that’s mostly a re­bound af­ter sharp falls, the re­cov­ery pace will prob­a­bly slow,” likely af­ter year-end, said chief econ­o­mist Yuichi Ko­dama at Meiji Ya­suda Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>More­over, a re­cov­ery in ex­ports would likely have lim­ited im­pact on the size of any fur­ther stim­u­lus pack­age given that the focus is ex­pected to be on help­ing firms suf­fer­ing from weak do­mes­tic de­mand, Mr Ko­dama said.</p>
    <p>By des­ti­na­tion, ship­ments to the United States rose 0.7 per cent, the first in­crease in 14 months, driven by stronger de­mand for elec­tri­cal power ma­chin­ery as well as pas­sen­ger cars, whose num­bers jumped 18 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports to China, Ja­pan’s largest trad­ing part­ner, rose 14 per cent, the sharpest rise since Jan­uary 2018. Ex­ports to Asia as a whole fell 2 per cent, their slow­est pace of de­cline since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Im­ports shed 17.2 per cent ver­sus the 21.4 per cent me­dian es­ti­mate of econ­o­mists polled by Reuters, re­sult­ing in a trade sur­plus of 675 bil­lion yen (S$8.7 bil­lion).</p>
