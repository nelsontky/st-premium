• The circuit breaker failure caused a secondary protection system to trip, cutting off power supply from the Tuas Depot substation.
This affected a larger zone of stations along the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL). 1 A burnt section of 22 kilovolt cables between Tuas Link station and Tuas West Road station triggered a power fault. • 4 Operator SMRT decided to draw power from the Buona Vista substation, which supplies power to the Circle Line (CCL). • • This causes 12 trains to stall on the tracks. It also affects in-train lighting and air-conditioni­ng. The backup battery on affected trains kicks in to provide emergency lighting and ventilatio­n. 2 The fault activated circuit breakers nearby, but one failed to trip and isolate the power fault as designed due to a melted trip coil. CAUSE OF POWER FAILURE An SMRT staff member and supervisor misread equipment at the substation and wrongly assumed the fault in Tuas had been isolated. Failure to isolate the fault before drawing power led to a voltage dip at the Buona Vista substation, causing a power trip that affected the CCL . Oct 14, 6.58pm A power outage caused by concurrent faults along the Tuas West Extension shuts down train service between Woodlands and Jurong East stations on the North-South Line and between Queenstown and Gul Circle stations on the East-West Line.
