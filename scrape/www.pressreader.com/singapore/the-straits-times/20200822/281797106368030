    <p>Thai­land plans to ex­tend its state of emer­gency till the end of next month to stave off a po­ten­tial sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, de­spite not record­ing any lo­cal trans­mis­sion for close to three months.</p>
    <p>This one-month ex­ten­sion is the fifth since the ini­tial or­der in March.</p>
    <p>“We can’t af­ford to have any sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, es­pe­cially now that we are in the nor­mal phase... open­ing busi­nesses and res­tart­ing ac­tiv­i­ties,” For­eign Min­istry deputy spokesman Nat­a­panu Nopakun said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials say the emer­gency de­cree al­lows the govern­ment to cut red tape and stream­line its re­sponse to the Covid-19 out­break, adding that it does not af­fect peo­ple’s daily lives since the coun­try lifted its cur­few in June.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the blighted eco­nomic out­look has helped fuel anti-govern­ment protests led by young peo­ple, which con­tinue to gather steam na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, over 10,000 peo­ple gath­ered in Bangkok, de­mand­ing that the Con­sti­tu­tion be amended and fresh elec­tions be called.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has de­tected 3,390 in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing an ad­di­tional im­ported case re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>New out­breaks in Viet­nam and New Zealand, which used to be front run­ners in curb­ing the Covid-19 spread, have put Thai of­fi­cials on their guard.</p>
    <p>Still, Asean’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy has al­lowed state schools to re­sume nor­mal op­er­a­tions last week, in­stead of stag­ger­ing at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tors will also be al­lowed back into sta­di­ums next month for the lo­cal foot­ball league.</p>
    <p>Strict bor­der con­trols con­tinue to bat­ter Thai­land’s tourism- and ex­port-de­pen­dent econ­omy, which shrank 12.2 per cent in the April to June quar­ter from a year ear­lier, the sharpest con­trac­tion since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1998.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s cen­tral bank ex­pects a full-year de­cline of 8.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel and air­fare sub­si­dies to stim­u­late do­mes­tic tourism have so far drawn a tepid re­sponse, prompt­ing the govern­ment to look into rais­ing the ben­e­fits and ex­tend­ing them to cor­po­rate trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>The poor jobs out­look is fu­elling mount­ing protests around the coun­try, with de­mon­stra­tors crit­i­cis­ing in­equal­ity which they say is per­pet­u­ated by the mil­i­tary-backed govern­ment led by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, a for­mer army chief who staged the 2014 coup.</p>
    <p>The peace­ful protests, which started in uni­ver­sity cam­puses and have grad­u­ally moved to the streets, have swelled in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have also be­gun call­ing for a re­form of the monar­chy, a sub­ject pre­vi­ously con­sid­ered un­touch­able in a king­dom where de­fam­ing or in­sult­ing the king, queen or heir ap­par­ent is pun­ish­able by up to 15 years in jail.</p>
    <p>High school stu­dents have also ral­lied in sup­port of the pro­test­ers by wear­ing white rib­bons and do­ing three-fin­ger salutes while singing the national an­them.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to re­ports of school ad­min­is­tra­tors in­tim­i­dat­ing these stu­dents, the state has re­minded schools to al­low stu­dents law­ful ex­pres­sion of dis­sent.</p>
    <p>Scores of ac­tivists ar­rested this week and later re­leased on bail in­cluded Mr Arnon Nampa, a lawyer who first made the call for monar­chy re­form, as well as mu­si­cian Dechathorn Bam­rung­muang, whose group’s rap against the govern­ment has gone vi­ral.</p>
