    <p>LANZHOU (China) • Peng Xiaol­ing, a 62-year-old marathoner in Lanzhou, cap­i­tal of north-west China’s Gansu Prov­ince, crossed the fin­ish line with her arms high up, cel­e­brat­ing vic­tory.</p>
    <p>She fin­ished her 25th marathon with a time of 4hr 23min.</p>
    <p>Although slower than her per­sonal best, she was sat­is­fied with this re­sult as she was the old­est ath­lete in the am­a­teur group.</p>
    <p>Sta­tis­tics show that China had more than 250 mil­lion peo­ple aged 60 and older by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>As liv­ing con­di­tions im­proved, se­niors are now pay­ing more at­ten­tion to health man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>And tak­ing part in sports has be­come a pop­u­lar choice in the pur­suit of phys­i­cal fitness and life en­rich­ment.</p>
    <p>“Se­niors are much more en­thu­si­as­tic about sports than the young, due to their flex­i­ble time sched­ules and ur­gent health de­mands,” said Madam Peng. “It is ob­vi­ous that the num­ber of el­derly marathon­ers is in­creas­ing in re­cent years and most of them are am­a­teurs run­ning for health and fun.”</p>
    <p>She ran her first marathon in 1988, mak­ing her pop­u­lar in sport­ing cir­cles in Lanzhou. As cap­tain of a lo­cal run­ning team, she has seen im­prove­ments in the sports in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“More in­door gyms and sports cen­tres are open to the public for free. With more pro­fes­sional in­stal­la­tions and fa­cil­i­ties, we have more choices for sports,” she says.</p>
    <p>In a yoga club, 65-year-old Cui Yunqi flung her­self into a hand­stand on a yel­low ham­mock un­der her yoga in­struc­tor’s guid­ance.</p>
    <p>This new type of yoga, called aerial yoga, in which prac­ti­tion­ers hang from a ham­mock sus­pended from the ceil­ing, is pop­u­lar world­wide.</p>
    <p>She was the only par­tic­i­pant older than 40 in the class and one of the best learn­ers.</p>
    <p>“I en­joy do­ing yoga. It is chal­leng­ing and ful­fill­ing,” she says. “Thanks to it, I’ve made new friends and ex­pe­ri­enced new things. It has made me feel young again.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter class, she posted a pic­ture of her prac­tis­ing yoga on so­cial me­dia and re­ceived the thumbs-up from her fam­ily in min­utes. In­stantly, she cheered up like a kid.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, short videos of older peo­ple en­gag­ing in sports in city parks have sparked dis­cus­sion in China.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens have ap­plauded some for their grace­ful move­ments on the par­al­lel bars and their pos­i­tive at­ti­tude to­wards life.</p>
    <p>“Life is colour­ful and we can make it count,” said marathoner Peng.</p>
