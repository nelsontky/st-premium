    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s top 10 most streamed artistes on Spo­tify chalked up a to­tal of 10.6 bil­lion streams on the plat­form last year, the pop­u­lar stream­ing ser­vice said last Thurs­day in its yearly wrap-up.</p>
    <p>Boy band BTS were the most streamed South Korean artiste glob­ally, fol­lowed by Black­pink, Twice, Stray Kids and Red Vel­vet, ac­cord­ing to Spo­tify’s 2020 Wrapped data.</p>
    <p>BTS also took the top spot in the cat­e­gory of the most-streamed global group last year.</p>
    <p>2020 Wrapped, which com­piles data from Jan 1 to Nov 15, is the op­er­a­tor’s an­nual flag­ship cam­paign that shows how its 320 mil­lion users around the world use the plat­form.</p>
    <p>Singer IU topped the list of most-streamed South Korean fe­male artistes and Agust D, bet­ter known as Suga of BTS, was the most-streamed male artiste last year.</p>
    <p>Spo­tify also un­veiled sev­eral up-and-com­ing South Korean rookie artistes on its plat­form.</p>
    <p>Boy band Trea­sure topped the list of most-streamed ris­ing South Korean artists, fol­lowed by solo singer AleXa and singer-song­writer Bibi, data showed. Artist Se­cret Num­ber and A.C.E also made it to the top 10.</p>
    <p>“The 2020 Wrapped data is an­other tes­ta­ment to Spo­tify’s com­mit­ment to the global suc­cess of South Korean artistes and mu­sic, help­ing them con­nect with and reach a global au­di­ence,” Spo­tify’s vice-pres­i­dent Mar­ian Di­cus said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Spo­tify an­nounced last month that it will launch its ser­vice in South Korea in the first half of this year. The Swedish firm plans to give South Korean lis­ten­ers ac­cess to more than 60 mil­lion tracks and over four bil­lion playlists.</p>
    <p>“With our up­com­ing launch in South Korea, we are hop­ing to help ac­cel­er­ate the growth of Korea’s en­tire mu­sic stream­ing ecosys­tem, ul­ti­mately ben­e­fit­ing artistes, fans and lis­ten­ers,” said Ms Di­cus.</p>
