    <p>About 370 fam­i­lies liv­ing in pub­lic rental flats have re­quested rent as­sis­tance each month from Jan­uary to July, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Over the same pe­riod, 325 house­holds had their rents re­duced by the Hous­ing Board.</p>
    <p>This re­duced rent will ap­ply for the rest of the house­hold’s cur­rent te­nancy term, which goes up to three years.</p>
    <p>Some 1,470 house­holds each month were placed on or asked for re­newed ComCare rent as­sis­tance, Mr Lee added.</p>
    <p>He pro­vided these fig­ures in a writ­ten par­lia­men­tary re­ply to Work­ers’ Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC), who asked for an up­date on the num­ber of house­holds that have sought as­sis­tance with rent pay­ments for this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who is also Min­is­ter-in­Charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion, said the HDB will help pub­lic rental house­holds get the as­sis­tance they re­quire, and that it is con­tin­u­ously mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms He also asked if the HDB is con­sid­er­ing a tem­po­rary rent freeze for ten­ants.</p>
    <p>To that, Mr Lee said that pub­lic rental rates are highly sub­sidised.</p>
    <p>“Rents are never raised within a te­nancy term, but can be low­ered at any time if the house­hold in­come falls. Rents are re­viewed only at te­nancy re­newal, which hap­pens ev­ery two to three years,” he said.</p>
    <p>Any house­holds which are hav­ing dif­fi­culty af­ford­ing their rent should ap­proach their lo­cal HDB branch for as­sis­tance, he added.</p>
    <p>In May, it was re­ported that around 5,200 – or one in 10 – pub­lic rental house­holds did not pay their rent on time.</p>
    <p>About three out of four of these house­holds, usu­ally lower-in­come fam­i­lies, owe less than $3,000 in rent. About half owe less than one year’s worth of rent.</p>
    <p>The HDB also helped 159 fam­i­lies move from two-room to one-room flats in the last three years.</p>
    <p>Then Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong had said that the HDB takes “a com­pas­sion­ate and holis­tic ap­proach” in as­sist­ing such ten­ants and will seek to un­der­stand their in­di­vid­ual cir­cum­stances.</p>
