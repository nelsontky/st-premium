    <p>With more peo­ple stay­ing home these past months, many are for­go­ing make-up, opt­ing for the au na­turel look, and giv­ing more at­ten­tion to skin­care, said in­dus­try play­ers.</p>
    <p>While most brick-and-mor­tar stores that stock skin­care prod­ucts had to close dur­ing the two month­long cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, on­line tills were ring­ing mer­rily as lo­cal skin­care brands saw a boost in sales.</p>
    <p>When home-grown brand Skin Inc had to shut its four phys­i­cal stores tem­po­rar­ily, there was cause for con­cern, said its global brand man­ager Rani Lany­i­fan Wang, 28.</p>
    <p>“There were no sales in-store at all, and we were ex­pect­ing a slow­down. But luck­ily we ad­justed, and dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, on­line sales were sur­pris­ingly good,” she said.</p>
    <p>On­line sales were about 400 per cent more than the usual in-store sales for its skin­care serums and de­vices, said Ms Wang. “This is a record for our on­line sales,” she said of the com­pany founded 12 years ago.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, busi­ness for lo­cal skin­care la­bel Rooki Beauty in­creased by five times, with more new cus­tomers learn­ing about the brand through word of mouth, said its founder Hay­ley Teo.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo, 27, said the brand, which started just over a year ago, has seen a 200 per cent in­crease in new cus­tomers since April.</p>
    <p>“It was like Christ­mas or fes­tive pe­ri­ods, sales were pretty hec­tic. Now, they have sta­bilised, but they are still higher than be­fore,” she said.</p>
    <p>ZOOM­ING IN ON SKIN­CARE</p>
    <p>With the rise in tele­con­fer­enc­ing in­stead of in-per­son meet­ings and fewer op­por­tu­ni­ties to ven­ture out of the home, more are go­ing sans make-up, said in­dus­try play­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo said: “Dur­ing video con­fer­ences on Zoom, peo­ple seem more com­fort­able see­ing each other with­out or in min­i­mal make-up. So, nat­u­rally, peo­ple started to fo­cus on ap­pear­ing fresh, alert and awake, and started in­vest­ing more in skin­care.”</p>
    <p>Skin Inc’s Ms Wang said that with men­tal health and self-care in the spot­light amid the pan­demic, peo­ple want­ing to take bet­ter care of their skin have pushed sales for its prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing to wear masks has also led to “maskne”, or acne trig­gered by mask-wear­ing, with cus­tomers seek­ing so­lu­tions to this and other skin­care prob­lems, she added.</p>
    <p>Skin Inc launched new prod­ucts for those with sen­si­tive skin to deal with mask wear­ing, as well as to help achieve a flaw­less, fresh look for video calls.</p>
    <p>Rooki’s Ms Teo no­ticed that dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, more cus­tomers were buy­ing skin­care prod­ucts and gift­ing them to loved ones.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions on leisure travel also played a part, she said. “In­stead of spend­ing on travel or din­ing ex­pe­ri­ences, peo­ple chose to spend on beauty prod­ucts and skin­care, which are things that can help them feel in­stantly bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>IN THE FACE OF COVID</p>
    <p>Ship­ping and lo­gis­tics de­lays proved to be a chal­lenge for Skin Inc, which has mul­ti­ple dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nels across the world.</p>
    <p>There were also de­lays in get­ting fresh sup­plies of pop­u­lar items when stocks ran out, said Ms Wang, not­ing that it took about two weeks to re­plen­ish these items.</p>
    <p>For Rooki Beauty, the Covid-19 out­break thwarted plans for the brand to gain ex­po­sure at in­ter­na­tional ex­hi­bi­tions and for net­work­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. “Other chal­lenges in­cluded sup­ply chain is­sues and in­creases in in­gre­di­ent prices, which de­layed our prod­uct launch,” said Ms Teo, not­ing that prices for some in­gre­di­ents in­creased by about 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the bare-faced, no make-up trend of the work-fromhome set, one lo­cal cos­met­ics brand has bucked the trend and seen an in­crease in its sales.</p>
    <p>Ms Nerissa Low, 37, founder of Liht Or­gan­ics, said it has seen “vi­brant” sales on­line in re­cent months, in par­tic­u­lar for its lip prod­ucts. “We thought that most peo­ple would not be putting on lip­stick since we are all wear­ing masks, but clearly we were wrong,” she said.</p>
    <p>It has seen a 300 per cent spike in on­line sales for its make-up, in­clud­ing lip­sticks, eye­liner, mas­cara and foun­da­tion, said Ms Low, who started the com­pany in March last year.</p>
    <p>“I think peo­ple are feel­ing a bit de­prived be­cause they do not get dressed up as of­ten. And many find that lip­stick is the quick­est way to look put to­gether for a Zoom call.”</p>
    <p>And for some, de­spite hav­ing to wear a mask when out and about, a lit­tle lip­stick goes a long way.</p>
    <p>“Even if it is hid­den be­hind a mask, they put it on for them­selves, and it gives them con­fi­dence,” she said.</p>
    <p>GO­ING AU NA­TUREL</p>
    <p>Dur­ing video con­fer­ences on Zoom, peo­ple seem more com­fort­able see­ing each other with­out or in min­i­mal make-up. So, nat­u­rally, peo­ple started to fo­cus on ap­pear­ing fresh, alert and awake, and started in­vest­ing ’’ more in skin­care.</p>
