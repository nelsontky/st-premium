    <p>BEI­JING • With 22 pages of vaguely worded edicts, China has cast doubt on the fu­ture of its big­gest In­ter­net com­pa­nies and ig­nited a US$290 bil­lion (S$391 bil­lion) eq­uity sell-off.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are now work­ing out how bad it might get for Alibaba Group Hold­ing, Ten­cent Hold­ings and other Chi­nese In­ter­net giants as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s gov­ern­ment pre­pares to roll out a raft of new anti-mo­nop­oly reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>As is al­most al­ways the case, China’s lead­ers have said lit­tle about how harshly they plan to clamp down or why they de­cided to act now.</p>
    <p>But the draft rules re­leased on Tues­day give the gov­ern­ment wide lat­i­tude to rein i n tech en­trepreneur­s – like Alibaba’s Jack Ma – who un­til re­cently en­joyed an unusual amount of free­dom to ex­pand their em­pires across nearly ev­ery as­pect of Chi­nese life.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s In­ter­net ecosys­tem – which has long been pro­tected from com­pe­ti­tion by the likes of Google and Face­book – is dom­i­nated by two com­pa­nies, Alibaba and Ten­cent, through a labyrinthi­ne net­work of in­vest­ment that en­com­passes the vast ma­jor­ity of the coun­try’s start-ups in are­nas from ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (SenseTime, Megvii) to fresh veg­eta­bles (Me­icai) to dig­i­tal fi­nance (Ant Group).</p>
    <p>Their pa­tron­age has also groomed a new gen­er­a­tion of ti­tans, in­clud­ing food and travel gi­ant Meituan and Didi Chux­ing, China’s Uber.</p>
    <p>Those that pros­per out­side their aura – the largest be­ing ByteDance, the owner of TikTok – are rare.</p>
    <p>The anti-mo­nop­oly rules now threaten to up­set that sta­tus quo with a range of po­ten­tial out­comes, from a be­nign sce­nario of fines to a break-up of industry lead­ers.</p>
    <p>While few China watch­ers claim to know where in that spec­trum the au­thor­i­ties will land, most view this week as a turn­ing point.</p>
    <p>“The Wild West era of pol­icy ar­bi­trage – tak­ing ad­van­tage of weak reg­u­la­tions over the sec­tor – has come to an end,” said se­cu­ri­ties at­tor­ney John Dong of Joint-Win Part­ners in Shanghai.</p>
    <p>Here are some sce­nar­ios that an­a­lysts and in­vestors are con­sid­er­ing:</p>
    <p>1. MILD</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mists say reg­u­la­tors are merely re­assert­ing their right to over­see In­ter­net com­pa­nies, with­out try­ing to ini­ti­ate dras­tic change.</p>
    <p>Even if the au­thor­i­ties do take ac­tion, China has a tra­di­tion of crack­ing down in fits and starts, or mak­ing ex­am­ples out of high-pro­file com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent, for in­stance, be­came a prom­i­nent tar­get of a cam­paign to com­bat gaming ad­dic­tion among chil­dren in 2018. While its shares took a hit, they even­tu­ally re­cov­ered to all-time highs.</p>
    <p>Alibaba has done the same af­ter run­ning afoul of the au­thor­i­ties on ev­ery­thing from un­fairly squeez­ing mer­chants to turn­ing a blind eye to fakes.</p>
    <p>Both com­pa­nies were worth around US$800 bil­lion be­fore shares be­gan tank­ing this month.</p>
    <p>“Each In­ter­net leader may face some im­pact and have to ad­just their prac­tices, but the reg­u­la­tions will un­likely af­fect their lead­er­ship,” said Hong Kong-based CLSA an­a­lyst Eli­nor Le­ung</p>
    <p>“In­ter­net platforms, by na­ture, are scale busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>Alibaba’s gen­eral man­ager of Tmall mar­ket­ing and op­er­a­tions Liu Bo said on the side­lines of the com­pany’s Sin­gles’ Day cel­e­bra­tion on Wed­nes­day that he was not sur­prised by the new rules, and that the gov­ern­ment was “im­prov­ing” over­sight across var­i­ous in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese In­ter­net stocks, led by Meituan and Ten­cent, gained at least 3 per cent yes­ter­day, re­coup­ing some of their two-day loss.</p>
    <p>2. BAD</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts pre­dict there is a crack­down com­ing, but a tar­geted one. They point to lan­guage in the reg­u­la­tions that sug­gests a heavy fo­cus on on­line com­merce, from forced exclusive ar­range­ments with mer­chants known as “pick one of two” to al­go­rithm-based prices favour­ing new users.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tions specif­i­cally warn against sell­ing be­low cost to weed out ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Those kinds of strate­gies helped drive eBay and Ama­zon.com out of China and have led com­pa­nies – in­clud­ing Alibaba, JD.com and up­start Pin­duo­duo – to ac­cuse one an­other of us­ing un­der­handed tac­tics.</p>
    <p>Also em­bed­ded within the rules is a ref­er­ence to the need for of­fi­cial ap­proval on all merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions in­volv­ing vari­able in­ter­est en­ti­ties (VIEs).</p>
    <p>The VIE model has never been for­mally en­dorsed by Bei­jing but has been used by tech ti­tans such as Alibaba to list shares over­seas.</p>
    <p>Un­der the struc­ture, Chi­nese cor­po­ra­tions trans­fer prof­its to an offshore en­tity with shares that for­eign in­vestors can then own.</p>
    <p>Pi­o­neered by Sina Corp and its in­vest­ment bankers dur­ing a 2000 ini­tial public of­fer­ing, the VIE frame­work rests on shaky le­gal ground and for­eign in­vestors have been peren­ni­ally ner­vous about their bets un­wind­ing overnight.</p>
    <p>“The VIE struc­ture has been op­er­at­ing in a grey area in China and, till this date, there’s no law say­ing if it’s il­le­gal or not,” said an­titrust spe­cial­ist Zhan Hao, a man­ag­ing part­ner at Bei­jing-based An­Jie Law Firm.</p>
    <p>One worry is that un­cer­tainty sur­round­ing the new rules will chill in­vest­ment, ac­qui­si­tions and ven­ture cap­i­tal fund­ing un­til of­fi­cials shed more light on what they are pre­pared to do.</p>
    <p>3. NIGHT­MARE</p>
    <p>Most worst-case sce­nar­ios re­volve around the idea that China’s lead­ers have grown frus­trated with the swag­ger of tech bil­lion­aires and want to teach them a les­son by break­ing up their com­pa­nies – even if it means short-term pain for the econ­omy and mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s pri­vate sec­tor has main­tained a del­i­cate re­la­tion­ship with the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party for decades, and has only re­cently been recog­nised as cen­tral to the na­tion’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Many com­men­ta­tors have at­trib­uted the re­cent crack­down on fin­tech com­pa­nies to re­marks made by Alibaba’s Mr Ma at a con­fer­ence last month, when he de­cried at­tempts to rein in the bur­geon­ing field as short-sighted and out­moded.</p>
    <p>Buried within the anti-mo­nop­oly rules is a para­graph bran­dish­ing vague but seem­ingly dire threats: Com­pa­nies that vi­o­late anti-mo­nop­oly reg­u­la­tions may be barred from ac­qui­si­tions.</p>
    <p>And, if they are to be al­lowed to pro­ceed, they may be forced to di­vest as­sets, share in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty or tech­nolo­gies, or open up in­fra­struc­ture to com­peti­tors and ad­just their al­go­rithms.</p>
    <p>“It’s highly likely that the guide­lines will bring about the even­tual split­ting off of sub­sidiaries, and could re­sult in the elim­i­na­tion of a lot of non-com­pli­ant smaller firms,” said Joint-Win Part­ners’ Mr Dong. “No coun­try in the world would al­low all these to ex­ist in one huge en­tity.”</p>
    <p>Alibaba, Ant and Ten­cent alone com­manded a com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of nearly US$2 tril­lion be­fore last week, eas­ily sur­pass­ing state-owned be­he­moths such as Bank of China as the coun­try’s most valu­able com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Alibaba and Ten­cent are also key back­ers of lead­ers in ad­ja­cent in­dus­tries – such as Meituan and Didi Chux­ing. They have in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars in hun­dreds of up-and-com­ing mo­bile and In­ter­net com­pa­nies, gain­ing king­maker sta­tus in the world’s largest smart­phone and In­ter­net mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Dong said: “There’s no such thing as too big to fail, not in China.”</p>
