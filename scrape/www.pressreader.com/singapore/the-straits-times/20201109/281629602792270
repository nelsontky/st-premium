    <p>WASHINGTON • The num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases in the United States rose by more than 100,000 for the third day in a row on Satur­day, as Covid-19 con­tin­ues its ag­gres­sive es­ca­la­tion around the na­tion.</p>
    <p>The US re­ported a record of more than 130,000 cases on Satur­day, said Reuters. In­fec­tions last Fri­day reached a record 126,714.</p>
    <p>Deaths are ris­ing: The na­tion counted 1,153 last Fri­day, the fourth day l ast week with more than 1,000, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Johns Hop­kins University and Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>That was al­most 100 a day more than the pre­vi­ous week and 31 per cent higher than av­er­age daily deaths in the first week of last month. It is sig­nif­i­cantly lower than the out­break’s first spike last spring, when sev­eral days neared or passed 2,500 daily deaths. The US death toll is now 236,099.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory sig­nals a turning point in the US’ re­sponse to the pan­demic with his prom­ise of an ag­gres­sive fed­eral ef­fort to con­tain a virus surge across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He plans to name a 12-mem­ber virus task force today, his first step to­wards ful­fill­ing one of his big­gest cam­paign prom­ises – to mount an ef­fec­tive re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The task force will be co-chaired by for­mer sur­geon-gen­eral Vivek Murthy, for­mer Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion com­mis­sioner David Kessler and Dr Mar­cella NunezSmith, a pro­fes­sor of pub­lic health at Yale University, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with his plans. It will also in­clude for­mer Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion health ad­viser Ezekiel Emanuel.</p>
    <p>The co-chair­men of the task force are sched­uled to brief Mr Bi­den today after the mem­bers are an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, New York re­ported 3,587 cases on Satur­day, the sec­ond day of more than 3,000 and the most since early May at the tail end of the deadly spring out­break.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Andrew Cuomo has fo­cused on rein­ing in “clus­ters” of the virus that have spread in parts of New York City and up­state, where the pos­i­tive rate is dou­ble that in the rest of the state.</p>
    <p>In Washington, there are fears of an­other out­break sweep­ing through the ranks of the na­tion’s top of­fi­cials. Six White House aides and a Trump cam­paign ad­viser – in­clud­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Mead­ows – have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Mr Mead­ows, who rou­tinely shrugged off the need to wear masks and em­braced Mr Trump’s strat­egy of play­ing down the threat from the coro­n­avirus over the sum­mer, in­formed a small group of White House ad­vis­ers that he had tested pos­i­tive for the virus last Wed­nes­day, a se­nior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Five other White House of­fi­cials also tested pos­i­tive for the virus in the days be­fore and after election day, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the di­ag­noses told The New York Times.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg News also re­ported on ad­di­tional cases around the Pres­i­dent, who con­tracted the virus last month and spent three days in the hospi­tal re­ceiv­ing ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Nick Trainer, who worked on the Pres­i­dent’s cam­paign, has also tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, a per­son briefed on his di­ag­no­sis said.</p>
    <p>News of the in­fec­tions emerged de­spite warn­ings to keep quiet about the new cases, ac­cord­ing to two White House of­fi­cials who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity to pub­licly dis­cuss in­ter­nal con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, Mr Mead­ows sought to keep an out­break in VicePres­i­dent Mike Pence’s of­fice from be­com­ing pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Mr Mead­ows, a for­mer mem­ber of Congress, is a gre­gar­i­ous pres­ence at the White House whose po­si­tion re­quires him to in­ter­act with peo­ple through­out the West Wing and fre­quently takes him to the res­i­den­tial part of the White House to meet the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, he was at Mr Trump’s election party at the White House, which in­cluded sev­eral hun­dred peo­ple gath­ered in the East Room for sev­eral hours, many of them not wear­ing masks as they min­gled while watch­ing the election re­turns.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s chief of staff was also in con­tact with a co­terie of aides ear­lier in the day at the Trump cam­paign head­quar­ters in Vir­ginia, crammed into a tight space, where he was not wear­ing a mask as the Pres­i­dent greeted cam­paign work­ers.</p>
