    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s picks for the United States’ top for­eign pol­icy and na­tional se­cu­rity roles send a clear mes­sage: The days of “Amer­ica First” are over, and the US wants to lead the world again.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s picks for the top for­eign pol­icy and na­tional se­cu­rity spots in his ad­min­is­tra­tion sent a clear mes­sage: the days of “Amer­ica First” are over and Amer­ica will take up the man­tle of global lead­er­ship again.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica’s back. We’re at the head of the ta­ble once again,” said Mr Bi­den in an in­ter­view with NBC, aired hours af­ter he in­tro­duced six top of­fi­cials he wants in his Cab­i­net yes­ter­day, the most se­nior among them be­ing his nom­i­nee for sec­re­tary of state Antony Blinken.</p>
    <p>His picks, who will have to be con­firmed by the Se­nate next year, will build coali­tions and work with al­lies to counter ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism, deal with the cli­mate cri­sis, and com­bat nu­clear pro­lif­er­a­tion and other threats, said Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Mr Jake Sul­li­van – Mr Bi­den’s for­mer ad­viser when he was vice-pres­i­dent – for na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser; for­mer diplo­mat Linda Thomas-Green­field for am­bas­sador to the United Na­tions; and for­mer sec­re­tary of state John Kerry as spe­cial pres­i­den­tial en­voy on cli­mate, mak­ing it the first time Amer­ica may have a full-time cli­mate change czar.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den also un­veiled his di­rec­tor of na­tional in­tel­li­gence nom­i­nee Avril Haines, who would be the first woman to lead the in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity, and his nom­i­nee for sec­re­tary of the Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity Ale­jan­dro May­orkas, who would be the first Latino and im­mi­grant to lead the depart­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s a team that re­flects the fact that Amer­ica is back. Ready to lead the world, not re­treat from it. Ready to con­front our ad­ver­saries, not re­ject our al­lies. And ready to stand up for our val­ues,” said Mr Bi­den in his home­town of Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
    <p>“They em­body my core be­lief that Amer­ica is strong­est when it works with its al­lies.”</p>
    <p>Their se­lec­tion re­flects a re­turn to a more tra­di­tional mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, but Mr Bi­den was also care­ful to note in his NBC in­ter­view that his ad­min­is­tra­tion would not be “a third Obama term”, point­ing out that the world they faced now was dif­fer­ent than in 2009 to 2017, when he served as vice-pres­i­dent un­der then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal watch­ers said the se­lec­tion made clear that Mr Bi­den would be a lib­eral in­ter­na­tion­al­ist pres­i­dent, a depar­ture from the more iso­la­tion­ist for­eign pol­icy of the in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den on his elec­tion win amid ten­sions be­tween their coun­tries and more than two weeks af­ter poll re­sults</p>
    <p>showed Mr Bi­den had won the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Stan­ford Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Michael McFaul, a for­mer US am­bas­sador to Rus­sia, noted on Twit­ter that Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy has his­tor­i­cally been shaped by two de­bates: iso­la­tion­ism ver­sus in­ter­na­tion­al­ism, and re­al­ism ver­sus lib­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>“Trump was an ex­trem­ist on both of these pol­icy de­bates – an ex­treme iso­la­tion­ist (Amer­ica First) and an ex­treme re­al­ist (he did noth­ing to ad­vance demo­cratic and hu­man rights val­ues),” Prof McFaul tweeted. “Bi­den made clear to­day that he is an in­ter­na­tion­al­ist and a ‘lib­eral’... some­one who will bring val­ues back to Amer­i­can for­eign pol­icy. He is the op­po­site of Trump. And so too are Tony Blinken and Jake Sul­li­van,” he added.</p>
    <p>The shift back to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism will be wel­comed by parts of the</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can and mil­i­tary es­tab­lish­ment who have pushed back against Mr Trump’s Amer­ica First pol­icy. These in­clude top of­fi­cials who served un­der Repub­li­can pres­i­dents – even un­der Mr Trump him­self.</p>
    <p>In a For­eign Af­fairs com­men­tary on Mon­day, Mr Trump’s for­mer sec­re­tary of de­fence James Mat­tis, along with other co-au­thors, wrote that Amer­ica First in prac­tice had meant “Amer­ica Alone”, and urged the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to re­verse it.</p>
    <p>They wrote: “We hope they will quickly re­vise the na­tional se­cu­rity strat­egy to elim­i­nate ‘Amer­ica first’ from its con­tents, restor­ing in its place the com­mit­ment to co­op­er­a­tive se­cu­rity that has served the United States so well for decades.”</p>
