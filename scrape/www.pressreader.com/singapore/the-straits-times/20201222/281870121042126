    <p>AMSTERDAM Europe’s medicine reg­u­la­tor yes­ter­day ap­proved the use of the Covid-19 vac­cine j ointly de­vel­oped by United States com­pany Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech, putting the bloc on course to start in­oc­u­la­tions within a week.</p>
    <p>“I am de­lighted to an­nounce that the EMA (Euro­pean Medicines Agency) sci­en­tific com­mit­tee met to­day and rec­om­mended a con­di­tional mar­ket­ing au­tho­ri­sa­tion in the EU for the vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech,” EMA chief Emer Cooke told an on­line press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“Our sci­en­tific opin­ion paves the way for the first mar­ket­ing au­tho­ri­sa­tion in the EU,” she noted, adding that it would cover all 27 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“It is a sig­nif­i­cant step for­ward in the fight against this pan­demic that is caus­ing suf­fer­ing and hard­ship.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing gained the green light from EMA, the fi­nal step is ap­proval by the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion (EC), which is ex­pected soon.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion typ­i­cally fol­lows the EMA’s ad­vice.</p>
    <p>EC chief Ur­sula von der Leyen said on Twit­ter: “It’s a de­ci­sive mo­ment in our ef­forts to de­liver safe & ef­fec­tive vac­cines to Euro­peans!”</p>
    <p>She added: “Now we will act fast. I ex­pect an @EU-Com­mis­sion de­ci­sion by this evening.”</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union coun­tries – in­clud­ing Ger­many, France, Aus­tria and Italy – have said they plan to start vac­ci­na­tions from Sun­day as Europe tries to catch up with the US and Bri­tain, where in­oc­u­la­tions be­gan ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Prepa­ra­tions for the vac­cine roll-out come as the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of a highly in­fec­tious new strain of the coro­n­avirus i n Bri­tain caused chaos across the re­gion, with coun­tries shut­ting off travel ties with the UK and dis­rupt­ing trade ahead of the Christ­mas hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Cooke said it ap­peared the Pfizer-BioNTech jab would work against the new strain.</p>
    <p>“At this mo­ment, there is no ev­i­dence to sug­gest this vac­cine will not work against the new vari­ant,” she added.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has killed about 470,000 Euro­peans and is pick­ing up pace in the win­ter months, crush­ing economies in the process.</p>
    <p>Many gov­ern­ments have im­posed tighter re­stric­tions on house­holds to try to curb a sec­ond wave of i nfec­tions and avoid over­whelm­ing health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Dr von der Leyen had al­ready tar­geted the start of vac­ci­na­tions over the Dec 27-29 pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Stu­dent medics, re­tired doc­tors, phar­ma­cists and sol­diers are be­ing drafted into a Euro­pean vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign of un­prece­dented scale.</p>
    <p>A phased-in ap­proach means front-line health­care work­ers and el­derly res­i­dents of care homes are be­ing pri­ori­tised, with most na­tional schemes not reach­ing the gen­eral pub­lic un­til the end of the first quar­ter of next year at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>The goal of the 27-mem­ber EU is to reach cov­er­age of 70 per cent of its 450 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>A phased-in ap­proach means front-line health­care work­ers and el­derly res­i­dents of care homes are be­ing pri­ori­tised, with most na­tional schemes not reach­ing the gen­eral pub­lic un­til the end of the first quar­ter of next year at the ear­li­est.</p>
