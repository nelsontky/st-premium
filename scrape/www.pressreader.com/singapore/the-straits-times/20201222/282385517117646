    <p>BEI­JING • China’s man­u­fac­tur­ing re­cov­ery, fu­elled in part by de­mand from Covid-19-con­strained con­sumers abroad, has soared past ex­pec­ta­tions this year, so much so that fac­to­ries are now strug­gling to fill a short­age of blue-col­lar work­ers to clear mount­ing or­ders.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s out­put of in­dus­trial ro­bots, com­puter equip­ment and in­te­grated cir­cuits has roared back from its coro­n­avirus paral­y­sis – pro­duc­tion for the year to last month is up 22.2 per cent, 10.1 per cent and 15.9 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Much of the man­u­fac­tur­ing boom has come from for­eign de­mand, with ex­port growth top­ping ex­pec­ta­tions for eight of the last nine months.</p>
    <p>The turn­around comes as China has mostly erad­i­cated the virus and con­trasts with the slug­gish come­backs seen in ma­jor in­dus­tri­alised peers, where fac­to­ries are still strug­gling with pan­demic dis­rup­tions and the hit to de­mand.</p>
    <p>China’s global ex­port share in­creased to more than 13 per cent in the sec­ond and third quar­ters this year from 11 per cent last year, ac­cord­ing to No­mura, the high­est for any quar­ter since at least 2006 when the in­vest­ment bank started com­pil­ing the data.</p>
    <p>While emer­gency stim­u­lus in the United States and Europe pumped money into con­sumers’ wal­lets, the fight to con­tain the virus in those mar­kets fired up de­mand both for China-made per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and gad­gets for Western­ers stuck at home.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment data shows that last month, there were more peo­ple em­ployed in the in­dus­trial sec­tor in Jin­hua city, which in­cludes the eastern ex­port hub of Yiwu, than there had been at any time since end-2017.</p>
    <p>“We laid off about 50 work­ers in the first half, and now with or­ders soar­ing, we’re short of staff and not able to fur­ther ramp up pro­duc­tion,” said Ms Deng Jin­ling, who owns a ther­mal flask fac­tory in Yiwu sell­ing to the Mid­dle East, the US and Europe.</p>
    <p>“We tried hir­ing dozens of tem­po­rary work­ers but they’re not good enough,” she said.</p>
    <p>Some work­ers she laid off have found jobs back home and were not will­ing to travel back just a few months be­fore the up­com­ing Chi­nese New Year hol­i­days in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>But with clients chas­ing her heels, Ms Deng bought two au­to­mated pro­duc­tion lines at the end of last month to boost ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>“We’ve never thought about do­ing this be­fore, but this year has been so busy and we’ve ex­hausted our op­tions,” she said. “One au­to­mated pro­duc­tion line is the equiv­a­lent of 10 work­ers.”</p>
    <p>A pri­vate index by Ren­min Univer­sity track­ing de­mand for bluecol­lar labour hit a record in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Some fac­tory man­agers have hiked wages by 25 per cent to 10,000 yuan (S$2,040) per month, well above the av­er­age start­ing wage for grad­u­ates, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>For China’s bi­cy­cle in­dus­try, 2020 is the best year in a decade, with con­sumers abroad crav­ing ex­er­cise and ways to avoid pub­lic trans­port, said Mr Liang Xiaol­ing, gen­eral man­ager at Guangzhouh­ead­quar­tered Tr in­xBik es .“Our ca­pac­ity maxed out in Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber, and we hired a lot of tem­po­rary work­ers to catch up with the de­mand,” he said, adding that or­ders are now stretch­ing into 2022.</p>
    <p>His fac­to­ries now em­ploy about 100 ex­tra tem­po­rary work­ers on top of 1,000 or so reg­u­lar staff.</p>
    <p>Although man­u­fac­tur­ing in­vest­ment was slow to re­cover, fall­ing 3.5 per cent over the first 11 months, strong ex­port de­mand helped it re­bound in the last quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment jumped 12.5 per cent year on year last month, up from 3.7 per cent in Oc­to­ber, ac­cord­ing to re­search from an­a­lysts at CICC, an in­vest­ment bank.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang Qin­ming, who owns a com­pany man­u­fac­tur­ing speak­ers for Euro­pean and Amer­i­can mar­kets, said de­mand is 25 per cent higher than in pre­vi­ous years.</p>
    <p>He has been pay­ing his nor­mal staff over­time to keep up and has also hired tem­po­rary work­ers for about 18 to 19 yuan an hour, 20 per cent more than his full-time work­ers. As a last re­sort, he has leased other fac­to­ries to take the load.</p>
    <p>A labour crunch is not the only con­straint. China’s lop­sided trade bal­ance – ex­port­ing three con­tain­ers for ev­ery one im­ported re­cently – and de­lays in con­tain­ers re­turn­ing to China due to the pan­demic over­seas have cre­ated se­vere ship­ping bot­tle­necks, now start­ing to pinch ex­ports.</p>
    <p>The ren­minbi is also hov­er­ing near multi-year peaks against the dol­lar, pres­sur­ing prof­its fur­ther.</p>
    <p>And an of­fi­cial gauge of fac­tory raw ma­te­rial costs reached the high­est level since 2017 last month.</p>
    <p>De­spite the red-hot de­mand, Mr Liang of Trinx Bikes said prof­its are be­ing squeezed.</p>
    <p>“Some of our or­ders are al­ready see­ing some losses,” he said.</p>
    <p>But for pol­i­cy­mak­ers, the ex­port boom has been a wel­come one in a tough year.</p>
    <p>The sur­pris­ing re­silience of China’s ex­port sec­tor, which em­ploys around 180 mil­lion peo­ple, has re­duced the need for mas­sive stim­u­lus to re­vive the econ­omy this year, said an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>China hit 122 per cent of its an­nual job cre­ation tar­get by the end of last month. But man­u­fac­tur­ers do not ex­pect this boom to last as other economies ramp up pro­duc­tion.</p>
