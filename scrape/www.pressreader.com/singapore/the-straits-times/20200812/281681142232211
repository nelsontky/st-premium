    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s re­cov­ery from its worst-ever quar­terly slump is likely to be slow and choppy, with a coro­n­avirus resur­gence loom­ing as a con­stant threat.</p>
    <p>Travel and tourism will con­tinue to bear the brunt of the pan­demic, and full re­vival of con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties may take longer than pre­vi­ously ex­pected.</p>
    <p>How­ever, most econ­o­mists ex­pect de­mand for se­lect ex­port goods and ro­bust de­mand for fi­nance and in­sur­ance as well as in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions ser­vices to help the econ­omy start its climb out of the depths of the re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward Lee, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank’s chief econ­o­mist for Asean and South Asia, said: “Any pickup in sec­ond-half growth is likely to be tepid.”</p>
    <p>The resur­gence of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in places in­clud­ing Aus­tralia, Hong Kong and Ja­pan, re­sult­ing in reim­po­si­tion of mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions, will likely keep the pace of re­open­ing grad­ual, he said.</p>
    <p>Also, geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions and the risk of cor­po­rate in­debt­ed­ness may also de­press in­vest­ment sen­ti­ment, he added.</p>
    <p>“On a more pos­i­tive note, Sin­ga­pore may con­tinue to ben­e­fit from phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and elec­tron­ics de­mand. Dig­i­tal pay­ments and so­lu­tions ac­tiv­ity may also con­tinue to sup­port the fi­nance and in­fo­comm sec­tors,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>While most econ­o­mists agreed that de­layed re­open­ings of in­ter­na­tional bor­ders, par­tic­u­larly for travel, will re­main a drag on any re­cov­ery, some sec­tors – such as phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, elec­tron­ics, gold and oil prod­ucts – are likely to per­form rel­a­tively bet­ter and sup­port ex­ports and gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) growth in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>Mr Irvin Seah, se­nior econ­o­mist at DBS Bank, said de­mand for biomed­i­cal prod­ucts, elec­tronic com­po­nents and semi­con­duc­tors has re­mained strong as com­pa­nies glob­ally turned to dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to over­come the dis­rup­tions to business pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>“The over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor is ex­pected to re­main an out­per­former for the year,” he said.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day up­graded its 2020 fore­casts for non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports, pro­ject­ing 3 per cent to 5 per cent year-onyear growth, com­pared with an ear­lier es­ti­mate of a 1 per cent to 4 per cent fall.</p>
    <p>Those pock­ets of re­silience may still not be enough to re­verse the surge in un­em­ploy­ment, as job creation usu­ally lags be­hind eco­nomic growth by sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>Mr Joshua Yim, chief ex­ec­u­tive of re­cruit­ment firm Achieve Group, said that while his business has picked up slightly af­ter a ma­jor plunge dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, firms are gen­er­ally still cau­tious about hir­ing.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est in hir­ing has fallen sharply among clients to just 55 per cent to 60 per cent of that for a typ­i­cal year, he pointed out. “I think it’s quite re­flec­tive of em­ploy­ers’ con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>Some of Mr Yim’s clients have said the tra­jec­tory of both the pan­demic and the econ­omy is still am­bigu­ous, and this is stop­ping them from hir­ing or con­sid­er­ing re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>But there are sec­tors where com­pa­nies are still look­ing to ex­pand their pay­roll. Firms are seek­ing work­ers in in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy roles and in man­u­fac­tur­ing, es­pe­cially those in the semi­con­duc­tor sub-sec­tors, Mr Yim said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing firm Akribis has been ac­tively hir­ing, though many can­di­dates are re­luc­tant to sign up as start­ing salar­ies have dropped be­low their ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Akribis chief ex­ec­u­tive Leow</p>
    <p>Yong Peng said: “These tra­di­tional me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing, elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing jobs have lost their ap­peal to the younger gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>These jobs are fun­da­men­tal to equip­ment build­ing and for the com­pany to com­pete with low­er­cost man­u­fac­tur­ing bases else­where, he said. Also, the Covid-19 travel curbs have made it dif­fi­cult to hire for­eign­ers, Mr Leow added.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try yes­ter­day up­dated its full-year GDP fore­cast to a con­trac­tion of 5 per cent to 7 per cent in 2020, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous fore­cast range of a 4 per cent to 7 per cent con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee of Stan­dard Char­tered said he will main­tain his 2020 growth fore­cast of a 6 per cent shrink­age.</p>
    <p>DBS’ Mr Seah, how­ever, low­ered his 2020 fore­cast to a 6.5 per cent con­trac­tion, down from the econ­omy shrink­ing 5.7 per cent pre­vi­ously. At the same time, he re­vised up his full-year GDP growth fore­cast for next year to 5.5 per cent, from an ear­lier 3.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>MAN­U­FAC­TUR­ING WILL STILL DO WELL</p>
    <p>The over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor is ex­pected to re­main an out­per­former for the year.’’</p>
    <p>MR IRVIN SEAH, DBS Bank se­nior econ­o­mist. He said de­mand for biomed­i­cal prod­ucts, elec­tronic com­po­nents and semi­con­duc­tors has re­mained strong as com­pa­nies turned to dig­i­tal so­lu­tions to over­come dis­rup­tions to their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>LACK OF IN­TER­EST IN EN­GI­NEER­ING</p>
    <p>These tra­di­tional me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing, elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing jobs have lost their ap­peal to the younger gen­er­a­tion.’’</p>
