    <p>For­mer Lions cap­tain Nazri Nasir suf­fered a mild stroke on Wed­nes­day, the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>An FAS spokesman said: “Young Lions head coach Nazri Nasir was ad­mit­ted to hospi­tal yes­ter­day for a med­i­cal pro­ce­dure and sub­se­quently suf­fered a mild stroke.</p>
    <p>“He is cur­rently re­cu­per­at­ing un­der the care of his doc­tors. We re­quest that his and his fam­ily’s pri­vacy be re­spected dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one at FAS would like to send their best wishes for a speedy re­cov­ery to coach Nazri.”</p>
    <p>Nazri skip­pered the national foot­ball team from 1998 to 2003 and re­tired in 2008.</p>
    <p>The for­mer mid­fielder took the reins of the Young Lions team who com­pete in the Sin­ga­pore Premier</p>
    <p>League (SPL) at the start of the year and guided them to a sev­en­th­placed fin­ish.</p>
    <p>He is un­der­stood to be in line to take charge of the national Un­der-22 team at next year’s SEA Games in Viet­nam. The 49-yearold is also as­sis­tant to national coach Tat­suma Yoshida, and had a brief stint as care­taker coach of the Lions in March last year.</p>
    <p>He was a mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore side who won the M-League and Malaysia Cup dou­ble in 1994.</p>
    <p>He also cap­tained the Lions side who won the 1998 Asean Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion Cham­pi­onship – then known as the Tiger Cup – Sin­ga­pore’s first in­ter­na­tional hon­our.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal foot­ball fra­ter­nity ral­lied be­hind Nazri on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>SPL club Lion City Sailors wished him a speedy re­cov­ery, and said: “Nazri Nasir is a fierce com­peti­tor who has in­spired sev­eral bat­tling per­for­mances in his Young Lions this last sea­son, and the Lion City Sailors look for­ward to more tough bat­tles against Nazri and his boys in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Malaysia Cup team­mate Ab­bas Saad said: “Pray­ing for your re­cov­ery soon and back to what you love most.”</p>
