    <p>Mid-ca­reer job seek­ers can now ap­ply for train­ing cour­ses of­fered by firms in in-de­mand sec­tors to help boost their em­ploy­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>They will re­ceive a monthly al­lowance of $1,500 while un­der­go­ing the cour­ses.</p>
    <p>IBM, Shopee and PBA Robotics are among the com­pa­nies that will be kick­ing off the first batch of cour­ses next month, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Chee Hong Tat told the me­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These cour­ses are one of two com­po­nents of the ear­lier an­nounced SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme, which will pro­vide 14,500 trainee­ships and train­ing pro­grammes for job seek­ers to gain in­dus­try-rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence while await­ing per­ma­nent em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said that while more busi­ness clo­sures and re­trench­ments are ex­pected due to the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic, there are also sec­tors that are ex­pected to grow, such as health­care and e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>“While we can­not save ev­ery com­pany, we have to help ev­ery worker to tran­sit to these new jobs. Some of them may re­quire train­ing to bridge the skills gap,” Mr Chee told re­porters dur­ing a visit to a jobs and skills kiosk at the Life­long Learn­ing In­sti­tute in Eunos.</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer work­ers re­quire spe­cial fo­cus as they have greater fi­nan­cial com­mit­ments and had al­ready been grap­pling with the chang­ing skill sets re­quired by firms be­fore the cur­rent cri­sis, he added.</p>
    <p>About 3,600 full-time train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties have been cre­ated in part­ner­ship with com­pa­nies thus far, and the goal is to raise this to 10,000 by the end of the year, said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­gramme, un­em­ployed work­ers can ap­ply for ei­ther an at­tach­ment with a com­pany or a full-time train­ing course that ranges from six to 12 months in du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The train­ing cour­ses will cover sec­tors that can pro­vide job op­por­tu­ni­ties as the econ­omy re­cov­ers, such as in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy (ICT) and man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>The sub­sidised fees for the cour­ses range from $500 to $1,000, and can be paid for us­ing Skill­sFu­ture cred­its.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants will re­ceive a monthly train­ing al­lowance of $1,500, as well as ca­reer ad­vi­sory as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>The train­ing cour­ses are open to Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents with two or more years of work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The other com­po­nent of the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme is trainee­ships.</p>
    <p>Those who opt for work at­tach­ments over train­ing cour­ses will re­ceive an al­lowance of up to $3,000 a month, of which 80 per cent will be paid by the Gov­ern­ment and 20 per cent by the or­gan­i­sa­tion they are at­tached to.</p>
    <p>More de­tails on trainee­ships will be an­nounced later.</p>
    <p>Mr Alex Ng, 47, who was at the jobs and skills event yes­ter­day hosted by Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore and Work­force Sin­ga­pore, told The Sun­day Times that he was eye­ing the cour­ses on of­fer by Google and other firms in the ICT in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who worked in IT sales for a multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tion for 13 years, was re­trenched about a month ago, though it has felt like “an eter­nity” to him.</p>
    <p>He said he hopes to pick up new skills that will help him in his job search, such as those re­lated to cloud tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“Some of my soft skills I can bring over, but for some ar­eas in ICT they want hard skills,” he said.</p>
    <p>The $1,500 train­ing al­lowance will help with his monthly ex­penses as the re­trench­ment pay­out he re­ceived amounted to just one month’s salary, he said.</p>
    <p>While find­ing new em­ploy­ment with a com­pa­ra­ble salary may not be easy, he said he re­mains op­ti­mistic about his fu­ture prospects.</p>
    <p>“If I re­ally needed to, I could be­come a Grab driver or find part­time work. There are jobs, it’s a mat­ter of whether you’re will­ing to take them,” he said.</p>
    <p>OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES EX­IST</p>
    <p>Some of my soft skills I can bring over, but for some ar­eas in in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy they want hard skills... If I re­ally needed to, I could be­come a Grab driver or find part-time work. There are jobs, it’s a mat­ter of whether you’re will­ing to ’’ take them.</p>

The 47-year-old said he was eye&#xAD;ing cour&#xAD;ses by Google and other firms in the in&#xAD;for&#xAD;ma&#xAD;tion and com&#xAD;mu&#xAD;ni&#xAD;ca&#xAD;tions tech&#xAD;nol&#xAD;ogy in&#xAD;dus&#xAD;try.</p>
