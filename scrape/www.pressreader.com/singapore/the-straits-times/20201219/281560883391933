    <p>Mak­ers of cars and elec­tronic de­vices from tele­vi­sions to smart­phones are sound­ing alarm bells about a global short­age of chips, which is caus­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing de­lays as con­sumer de­mand bounces back from the Covid-19 cri­sis and is pick­ing up faster than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>SEOUL/SHENZHEN/BER­LIN Mak­ers of cars and elec­tronic de­vices from tele­vi­sion sets to smart­phones are sound­ing alarm bells about a global short­age of chips, which is caus­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing de­lays as con­sumer de­mand bounces back from the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem has sev­eral causes, in­clud­ing bulk-buy­ing by US sanc­tions-hit Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy giant Huawei Tech­nolo­gies, a fire at a chip plant in Ja­pan, coro­n­avirus lock­downs in South-east Asia and a strike in France.</p>
    <p>But more fun­da­men­tally, there has been un­der-in­vest­ment in eight-inch chip man­u­fac­tur­ing plants owned mostly by Asian firms, and they have strug­gled to ramp up pro­duc­tion as de­mand for 5G phones, lap­tops and cars picked up faster than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“For the whole elec­tron­ics industry, we’ve been ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a short­age of com­po­nents,” said Mr Donny Zhang, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Shenzhen-based sourc­ing firm Sand and Wave, who said he faced de­lays in ob­tain­ing a mi­cro-con­troller unit key to a smart head­phone prod­uct he was work­ing on.</p>
    <p>“We were orig­i­nally plan­ning to com­plete pro­duc­tion in one month, but now it looks like we’ll need to do it in two.”</p>
    <p>A source at a Ja­panese elec­tron­ics com­po­nent sup­plier said it was see­ing short­ages of Wi-Fi and Blue­tooth chips and was ex­pect­ing de­lays of more than 10 weeks.</p>
    <p>The car industry in China, which flagged the is­sue ear­lier this month, is an­tic­i­pat­ing pro­duc­tion at some Chi­nese car­mak­ers to be af­fected in the first quar­ter of next year, ac­cord­ing to a se­nior industry as­so­ci­a­tion of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer de­mand in China, es­pe­cially for cars, has snapped back un­ex­pect­edly quickly from the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Or­ders for prod­ucts such as lap­tops and mo­bile phones in re­gions still strug­gling with pan­demic re­stric­tions, such as Eu­rope and the United States, have also picked up.</p>
    <p>Om­dia se­nior an­a­lyst Kevin An­der­son said: “Since (th­ese prod­ucts) all com­pete for the same fab (fab­ri­ca­tion plant) re­sources, the short­age is across all of th­ese sec­tors and oth­ers as well. Th­ese are just the most ap­par­ent right now.”</p>
    <p>Dutch chip sup­plier NXP Semi­con­duc­tors has told clients it must raise prices on all prod­ucts due to a sig­nif­i­cant rise in ma­te­ri­als costs and a se­vere short­age of chips.</p>
    <p>“Busi­ness came back much faster than we ex­pected,” NXP CEO Kurt Siev­ers told German busi­ness daily Han­dels­blatt last week.</p>
    <p>“Many cus­tomers or­dered too late. As a re­sult, we are not able to keep up in some ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>Other short-term trig­gers for the chip short­age in­clude stock­pil­ing by Huawei ahead of mid-Septem­ber when its sup­pli­ers had to com­ply with US sanc­tions, CICC an­a­lyst Huang Leping said in a Dec 11 note.</p>
    <p>This was ag­gra­vated by Huawei’s ri­vals such as Xiaomi seek­ing to gain mar­ket share by step­ping up or­ders of com­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Xiaomi and Huawei de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics mak­ers, in­clud­ing Pana­sonic and Yamaha, also warn that they face some chip short­ages that are slow­ing pro­duc­tion of au­dio equip­ment and video cam­eras af­ter a mas­sive fire in Oc­to­ber dam­aged a chip plant owned by Asahi Ka­sei Mi­crode­vices.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns have sur­faced, too, over strikes in France at Swiss-based chip­maker STMi­cro­elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>Mr Eric Po­tard, leader of the work­ers’ union at the group, said the strike re­sulted in a fall in ac­tiv­ity of about 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>But STMi­cro said it had no im­pact on pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The surge in de­mand has meant that eight-inch plants, which tend to make older, less so­phis­ti­cated chips, are un­der strain, an­a­lysts and industry sources said.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s TSMC dom­i­nates the mar­ket for con­tract chip man­u­fac­tur­ing, with Sam­sung trail­ing a dis­tant sec­ond, fol­lowed by the likes of Glob­alFoundrie­s and SMIC.</p>
    <p>A Euro­pean semi­con­duc­tor industry source said TSMC and Glob­alFoundrie­s, in par­tic­u­lar, looked to be un­der pres­sure.</p>
    <p>TSMC, which counts Ap­ple and Qual­comm among its cus­tomers, re­ferred to com­ments its chair­man made this week that de­scribed the firm’s ca­pac­ity as tight.</p>
    <p>A Glob­alFoundrie­s spokesman said it was in­vest­ing in “ca­pac­ity growth to meet this un­prece­dented de­mand”.</p>
