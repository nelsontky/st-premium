    <p>Utico has again ex­tended the dead­line of its pro­posed res­cue deal for Sin­ga­pore’s Hyflux, this time by a month.</p>
    <p>The ail­ing wa­ter treat­ment com­pany now has un­til 5pm on Aug 30 to ac­cept the of­fer pur­suant to its re­quest for an ex­ten­sion, Utico said in a let­ter to Hyflux dated last Fri­day, which was the orig­i­nal dead­line.</p>
    <p>The of­fer will re­main open for ac­cep­tance this month ir­re­spec­tive of whether a ju­di­cial man­ager is ap­pointed or not, the Mid­dle Eastern util­ity firm added.</p>
    <p>An un­se­cured work­ing group of bank len­ders is pre­par­ing to file an ap­pli­ca­tion with the Sin­ga­pore High Court by Fri­day to place Hyflux un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Hyflux will thus have “stronger bona fide grounds” if there is an ex­plicit ac­cep­tance of Utico’s of­fer by to­mor­row by Hyflux and the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias, the Emi­rati suitor wrote in its let­ter.</p>
    <p>Hyflux and Sias had sent re­sponses to Utico last Thurs­day and Fri­day, stat­ing that nei­ther of them dif­fer­en­ti­ates any in­vestor.</p>
    <p>They also ac­knowl­edged that Hyflux has no other “bind­ing offers” to date, and has re­ceived only let­ters of in­ter­est and in­vi­ta­tions to of­fer ad­dressed to se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors and medi­umterm note hold­ers, Utico said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Utico, its pro­posal is con­sid­ered a de facto ex­ten­sion of the re­struc­tur­ing agree­ment signed in Novem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Sias clar­i­fied in a press state­ment that it does not plan to en­dorse any of the res­cue offers for the wa­ter treat­ment firm put forth by po­ten­tial white knights, in­clud­ing Utico.</p>
    <p>This was in re­sponse to Utico’s July 29 state­ment urg­ing the in­vestor ad­vo­cacy group to en­dorse its pro­posed $485 mil­lion cas­hand-stock res­cue pack­age.</p>
    <p>Utico said its of­fer could “save” Hyflux from ju­di­cial man­age­ment and pro­vide the high­est pos­si­ble re­cov­ery for the re­tail in­vestors hold­ing Hyflux’s per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares.</p>
