    <p>LOUISVILLE • One of the po­lice of­fi­cers who shot black emer­gency med­i­cal tech­ni­cian Bre­onna Tay­lor in Louisville and the of­fi­cer who pre­pared the war­rant for the botched raid dur­ing which she was killed in her apart­ment have been dis­missed, said their union.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay­lor was fa­tally shot when po­lice en­tered her apart­ment in Louisville, Ken­tucky, on March 13 – one of a string of killings of African Amer­i­cans that fu­elled mass protests across the United States last year.</p>
    <p>De­tec­tive Myles Cos­grove, one of the of­fi­cers who shot Ms Tay­lor, and De­tec­tive Joshua Jaynes, who pre­pared the search war­rant, had been told last De­cem­ber that the Louisville Metro Po­lice Depart­ment (LMPD) aimed to fire them.</p>
    <p>Their union, the River City Fra­ter­nal Order of Po­lice, said the two had been dis­missed and de­scribed the ter­mi­na­tions as “un­jus­ti­fied”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tay­lor’s boyfriend, who was with her when po­lice burst into the home, fired once at what he said he be­lieved were in­trud­ers. Three po­lice of­fi­cers re­sponded with 32 shots, six of which struck Ms Tay­lor, killing her.</p>
    <p>“There is cer­tainly no ev­i­dence in this case that poli­cies and pro­ce­dures of the LMPD were vi­o­lated to the ex­tent that war­ranted ter­mi­na­tion,” the union said on Wed­nes­day. “In­terim Chief (Yvette) Gen­try not only made the wrong de­ci­sion but also sent an omi­nous mes­sage to ev­ery sworn of­fi­cer of the LMPD.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cos­grove was fired for use of deadly force in fir­ing 16 rounds into Ms Tay­lor’s home and fail­ing to ac­ti­vate his body cam­era, CNN re­ported, cit­ing a copy of his ter­mi­na­tion let­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Jaynes, who had pre­pared the search war­rant for the raid on Ms Tay­lor’s home, was fired on Tues­day for “fail­ing to com­plete a Search War­rant Op­er­a­tions Plan form”, CNN re­ported.</p>
