    <p>• The In­done­sian gov­ern­ment is set to step up its pub­lic cam­paign to en­cour­age mask-wear­ing in the next few weeks as Covid-19 cases in the coun­try con­tinue to rise, The Jakarta Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­ported 2,473 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal to 121,226, data from the gov­ern­ment’s Covid-19 task force web­site showed. The coun­try also re­ported 72 new deaths, tak­ing the to­tal to 5,593.</p>
    <p>The virus has spread to all of the coun­try’s 34 prov­inces.</p>
    <p>“(Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo) has asked us to ed­u­cate the pub­lic on health pro­to­cols,” Co­or­di­nat­ing Hu­man De­vel­op­ment and Cul­ture</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Muhad­jir Ef­fendy said in a state­ment on Tues­day. “We (will) start with the es­sen­tial, which is mask-wear­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added that the gov­ern­ment would es­tab­lish a pro­gramme, spear­headed by the co­or­di­nat­ing min­is­ter’s of­fice, to in­ten­sify the cam­paign to wear a face mask in pub­lic places, in­clud­ing ap­point­ing a mask-wear­ing “am­bas­sador” and dis­tribut­ing so­cial aid pack­ages that in­clude face masks.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment also plans to is­sue pub­lic ser­vice com­mer­cials in print and on­line pub­li­ca­tions, so­cial me­dia and bill­boards, in ad­di­tion to ed­u­cat­ing the pub­lic on the law re­gard­ing wear­ing a face mask.</p>
    <p>“The main tar­gets of this cam­paign are peo­ple who have ac­tiv­i­ties in tra­di­tional and mod­ern mar­kets, ter­mi­nals, sta­tions, pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties, houses of wor­ship, pub­lic open spa­ces, those who co-live such as in or­phan­ages and those who have ac­tiv­i­ties on the streets, and so on,” The Post quoted Mr Muhad­jir as say­ing.</p>
    <p>The co­or­di­nat­ing min­is­ter also or­dered the Co­op­er­a­tives and Small and Medium En­ter­prises Min­istry and the State-Owned En­ter­prises Min­istry to pro­cure a large num­ber of face masks from mi­cro and ul­tra­mi­cro in­dus­tries to ful­fil the pub­lic need while sup­port­ing small busi­nesses, The Post said.</p>
    <p>Com­pli­ance with health pro­to­cols still leaves much to be de­sired. For ex­am­ple, the Jakarta ad­min­is­tra­tion an­nounced on Mon­day that it had col­lected a to­tal of 2.47 bil­lion ru­piah (S$232,000) in fines from vi­o­la­tors of so­cial re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing from 62,198 peo­ple who were not wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin will launch a new cam­paign to bat­tle the pan­demic to­day, the Ber­nama news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and Multimedia sec­re­tary-gen­eral Suri­ani Ah­mad said the ac­tion of every mem­ber of the com­mu­nity was cru­cial in the cur­rent cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“This cam­paign is to raise the aware­ness level and em­power the peo­ple to pro­tect them­selves, their fam­i­lies and the com­mu­nity in the ef­fort to fight Covid-19 and cul­ti­vate the new norms.</p>
    <p>“Now, we (the so­ci­ety) are the front lin­ers. We used to rely on nurses, doc­tors and po­lice per­son­nel. Now, it is our turn to step for­ward as the front lin­ers to fight the Covid-19 pan­demic,” she said in a live broad­cast on the Buletin Ber­nama pro­gramme pro­duced by Ber­nama TV.</p>
    <p>The Em­brac­ing New Norms cam­paign will be launched by Tan Sri Muhyid­din in Jo­hor to­day.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign, which will be car­ried out un­til De­cem­ber, aims to in­stil self-dis­ci­plined prac­tices among or­di­nary Malaysians to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
