    <p>A brush with mal­ware when he was a teenager made Mr Sunny Neo de­cide to be­come a hacker for good. For a good pur­pose, that is. He de­cided to pur­sue a ca­reer in cy­ber se­cu­rity af­ter his per­sonal com­puter was in­fected and he had a hard time get­ting it to run again.</p>
    <p>“I was fas­ci­nated with how se­cu­rity vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties can be used to ma­nip­u­late com­puter sys­tems into per­form­ing ac­tiv­i­ties the soft­ware mak­ers did not in­tend,” he said.</p>
    <p>So he took up a diploma in cy­ber and dig­i­tal se­cu­rity (now called diploma in cy­ber se­cu­rity and dig­i­tal foren­sics) at Te­masek Polytech­nic in 2006.</p>
    <p>He also com­pleted a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in com­puter science at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity and a mas­ter’s at Ge­or­gia In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>At 32, he is now a di­rec­tor and red team lead for pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm Aon’s cy­ber so­lu­tions in Asia. He leads a team of eth­i­cal hack­ers to con­duct ad­ver­sary sim­u­la­tions for clients to as­sess how well they can de­tect and re­spond to at­tacks.</p>
    <p>“I play the bad guy try­ing to breach clients’ com­puter sys­tems with the pur­pose of test­ing their cy­ber se­cu­rity de­fence,” he said.</p>
    <p>This can in­clude de­vel­op­ing mal­ware to get past an­tivirus soft­ware, im­ple­ment­ing con­vinc­ing phish­ing cam­paigns and search­ing for ways to com­pro­mise the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s crit­i­cal as­sets.</p>
    <p>Be­fore land­ing his dream job at Aon last year, Mr Neo worked at two other firms in se­cu­rity test­ing roles and was an ad­junct polytech­nic lec­turer, while search­ing for a role in ad­ver­sary sim­u­la­tion. It was not a com­monly known term here un­til the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore re­leased red team­ing guide­lines for fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in 2018, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo does a lot of in­de­pen­dent re­search to plan his own learn­ing road map, tak­ing cour­ses, gain­ing in­dus­try cer­ti­fi­ca­tions and dis­cussing ideas and is­sues</p>
    <p>with friends in the lo­cal se­cu­rity com­mu­nity. He also keeps his skills sharp by ex­per­i­ment­ing with dif­fer­ent tech­nolo­gies in a vir­tual lab­o­ra­tory he has set up at his home us­ing open source soft­ware.</p>
    <p>His hard work ap­pears to have paid off. Based on five job posts on MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg, the monthly salary for pen­e­tra­tion test­ing and red team-re­lated jobs can range from $7,000 to $14,000.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of In­for­ma­tion Se­cu­rity Pro­fes­sion­als (AiSP) pres­i­dent Johnny Kho said it takes con­sid­er­able time, com­mit­ment and pas­sion for red team­ing pro­fes­sion­als to hone their skills, which are in­creas­ingly valu­able as more busi­ness sup­ply chains are in­ter­con­nected on dig­i­tal plat­forms and har­ness­ing data.</p>
    <p>For peo­ple in­ter­ested in this line of work, Mr Neo rec­om­mends ac­tively par­tic­i­pat­ing in lo­cal se­cu­rity com­mu­ni­ties such as AiSP – of which he is a co-opted ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee mem­ber – Di­vi­sion Zero and The Open Web Ap­pli­ca­tion Se­cu­rity Project Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo still con­sid­ers him­self a cy­ber-se­cu­rity stu­dent and hopes to im­prove in train­ing and men­tor­ing oth­ers, he said.</p>
    <p>“Even­tu­ally, I would like to make an im­pact in the cy­ber-se­cu­rity space at the na­tional level,” he said.</p>
