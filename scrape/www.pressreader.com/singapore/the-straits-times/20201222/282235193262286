    <p>A for­mer deputy project man­ager was jailed for 15 weeks and fined $6,000 yes­ter­day for his role in a graft case in­volv­ing in­spec­tions of the Cus­toms Op­er­a­tions Com­mand Com­plex (COCC) con­struc­tion site.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese na­tional Guo Ji­axun, 34, who worked for con­struc­tion firm New­con Builders from 2015 to 2018, pleaded guilty to three counts each of cor­rup­tion and fal­si­fi­ca­tion of ac­counts.</p>
    <p>He was the sec­ond per­son linked to the case to be dealt with in court. In Oc­to­ber, Lee Mun Cheng, 53, was jailed for 18 weeks and fined $7,000 af­ter ac­cept­ing bribes in re­turn for show­ing le­niency over site in­spec­tions of the COCC.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, who was then work­ing as a res­i­dent tech­ni­cal of­fi­cer for CPG Con­sul­tants – which in­spects on-site me­chan­i­cal con­struc­tion works – was also or­dered to pay a penalty of $5,319.78, which was the to­tal amount he took in bribes.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Guo was the ini­tia­tor of the ar­range­ment be­fore it was pro­posed to Lee.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing two other men – In­dian na­tional Ra­jen­dran Thi­a­gara­jan, 33, and Sin­ga­porean Lin Haifeng, 45 – are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor (DPP) Joseph Gwee said that on Sept 23, 2016, New­con was awarded a con­tract to be the main build­ing con­trac­tor for Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms’ COCC project.</p>
    <p>Around Fe­bru­ary 2017, CPG de­ployed Lee to work on the project in Bulim Drive in Jurong West. He was re­spon­si­ble for en­sur­ing that con­struc­tion works were done ac­cord­ing to con­trac­tual re­quire­ments. His work­ing hours were 8.30am to 5.30pm on week­days, and 8.30am to 12.30pm on Satur­days.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Lee could claim over­time pay from CPG only if he was phys­i­cally present on­site to per­form in­spec­tion beyond his nor­mal work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>DPP Gwee said that some time in Au­gust 2017, Guo found that Lee was too strict in his in­spec­tions and this caused de­lays in the project. Guo then dis­cussed the mat­ter with Lin.</p>
    <p>The DPP added: “Guo sug­gested to Lin to plan more OT (over­time) for Lee, which would re­sult in more money for Lee. This was in­tended to be grat­i­fi­ca­tion for Lee, to in­duce Lee to be more le­nient with his in­spec­tions of New­con’s work in re­turn.”</p>
    <p>DPP Gwee also said Guo sug­gested that Lee be al­lowed to claim over­time even when Lee did not per­son­ally con­duct the in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>Lin agreed with Guo, as they wanted the COCC project to progress more smoothly, the court heard. Lee agreed to be part of the plan when he was ap­proached.</p>
