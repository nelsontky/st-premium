    <p>Since the lift­ing of the cir­cuit breaker on June 2, the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases has in­creased, al­though they con­tinue to re­main low with about an av­er­age of 12 per day in the past week, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But it is still not the time to cel­e­brate and be com­pla­cent as the coun­try is def­i­nitely not out of the woods yet, he said.</p>
    <p>Around half of the com­mu­nity cases over the last two weeks were linked, and most were de­tected as a re­sult of con­tact trac­ing or proac­tive screen­ing.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the un­linked cases, or seven in 10 of them, were asymp­to­matic at the time they were tested, and al­most half were likely to be past in­fec­tions as they tested pos­i­tive dur­ing serol­ogy tests, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>Those who are asymp­to­matic re­main com­pletely so through­out the en­tire course of ill­ness, while pre-symp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als are asymp­to­matic at the time of test­ing, and man­i­fest some symp­toms only a day or two later.</p>
    <p>Asymp­to­matic cases are gen­er­ally picked up dur­ing proac­tive screen­ing, such as when the Covid-19 task force con­ducts reg­u­lar screen­ing of front-line work­ers. Some might be picked up in­ci­den­tally, such as when the pa­tient is sus­pi­cious and de­cides to get tested.</p>
    <p>A large pro­por­tion of the un­linked com­mu­nity cases was clas­si­fied as such be­cause the task force was un­able to iden­tify the spe­cific in­di­vid­ual or clus­ter that passed the in­fec­tion to them, but the cases ap­peared to be linked broadly to the con­struc­tion and re­lated sec­tors, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>“We are keep­ing an es­pe­cially close watch on the symp­to­matic un­linked cases that are de­tected in the com­mu­nity through our rou­tine screen­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>The task force has also sig­nif­i­cantly scaled up test­ing of those with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion (ARI) symp­toms at first pre­sen­ta­tion to the doc­tor, and is now test­ing around 2,400 ARI cases a day on av­er­age.</p>
