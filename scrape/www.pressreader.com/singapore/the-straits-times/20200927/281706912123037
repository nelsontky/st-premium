    <p>WORK-LIFE BAL­ANCE</p>
    <p>MORE CON­TROL</p>
    <p>PONTIAN • The two land border cross­ings with Sin­ga­pore should be re­opened as soon as pos­si­ble, as the Jo­hor state gov­ern­ment is not ca­pa­ble of find­ing em­ploy­ment for 100,000 Malaysians who may lose their jobs due to the pro­longed clo­sure, said Men­teri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad.</p>
    <p>Datuk Hasni said the un­em­ploy­ment rate in the state was al­ready at a record high of 18 per cent with 35,000 peo­ple job­less. “The time has come for the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to find a way to bal­ance the peo­ple’s lives and their liveli­hoods, as we do not want the scale to tip only to­wards lives due to the Covid-19 pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Hasni said 5 per cent to 10 per cent of busi­nesses in the city area had closed as a re­sult of cash flow is­sues since the border clo­sure in March.</p>
    <p>He said the econ­omy of Jo­hor, which pre­vi­ously had some 250,000 peo­ple com­mut­ing daily be­tween both coun­tries to earn their keep, had been hit hard.</p>
    <p>“Jo­hor’s trade, among the high­est in the coun­try for five years since 2013, has also been badly af­fected.</p>
    <p>“Some 100,000 Malaysians may lose their jobs if the clo­sure is pro­longed,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Hasni said that as the state’s chief min­is­ter, he was in touch with Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to find a way to keep the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol while mov­ing to fully re­open the border.</p>
    <p>He also said it was an op­por­tune time for the border to be re­opened for daily com­mute, as Jo­hor has been a green zone for some time.</p>
    <p>“Let’s start with stu­dents and then grad­u­ally move to work­ers,” he said, when asked to com­ment on pleas from var­i­ous quar­ters to re­open the border with Sin­ga­pore to spur eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Since border move­ments were cur­tailed in March, many busi­nesses have been suf­fer­ing, with some see­ing up to a 70 per cent de­cline with­out the pa­tron­age of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Asked about the move by Sin­ga­pore to slowly lift re­stric­tions on Malaysians since Sept 1, which in­cluded re­duc­ing quar­an­tine time to only seven days, Mr Hasni said: “The Malaysian side should al­ways re­cip­ro­cate and co­or­di­nate the SOP (stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dure) with its Sin­ga­porean coun­ter­part, as I be­lieve the health de­part­ments of both coun­tries are con­stantly in touch.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that just as Jo­hor’s econ­omy was wors­en­ing, Sin­ga­pore was also ex­pe­ri­enc­ing its worst eco­nomic con­trac­tion in 55 years.</p>
    <p>State Health and En­vi­ron­ment Com­mit­tee chair­man R. Vidyanan­than also felt it was time for the land border to re­open in stages.</p>
    <p>“We feel that blan­ket SOP can­not be ap­plied here; Jo­hor and Sin­ga­pore should fol­low a dif­fer­ent cri­te­rion,” he said. “The Jo­hor gov­ern­ment has given our sug­ges­tions on the SOP to the fed­eral gov­ern­ment and hope they will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion and im­ple­mented soon for eco­nomic con­sid­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides, Jo­hor has been a green zone for more than a month since the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane and the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment started with Sin­ga­pore, he said.</p>
    <p>At the start, it was dif­fi­cult to bal­ance the work-life... ra­tio. I found my­self work­ing longer hours while at home due to the blurred line be­tween work and life. As I got more ac­cus­tomed to it, I am now able to bet­ter jug­gle work and life hap­pen­ing con­cur­rently.</p>

    <p>One thing I also truly ap­pre­ci­ate is the abil­ity to con­trol the tem­per­a­ture at home. Not hav­ing the cen­tralised air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tem blast­ing down... is a big plus for me.</p>
