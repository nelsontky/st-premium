    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) has re­sponded to two fe­male stu­dents who said the univer­sity made po­lice re­ports about their complaints of sex­ual mis­con­duct against their wishes.</p>
    <p>NUS said yes­ter­day that it filed a po­lice re­port on Oct 21 re­gard­ing the al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct to ful­fil its le­gal obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Both stu­dents told The Straits Times ear­lier they were un­happy that NUS in­formed them that it made a po­lice re­port about for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando only after it had done so.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence on Oct 23, the univer­sity said it had at­tempted to con­tact both vic­tims be­fore the po­lice re­port against Dr Fer­nando was made, but was un­able to reach one of the vic­tims.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment yes­ter­day, NUS said: “This may have given the im­pres­sion that we had in­formed one stu­dent that NUS was mak­ing a po­lice re­port just be­fore we made it.</p>
    <p>“We would like to clar­ify that what we had in­formed the stu­dent of was that NUS had a le­gal duty to file a po­lice re­port, and would ex­er­cise this duty in ac­cor­dance with NUS pol­icy, if she chose not to do so. NUS also did not in­form the stu­dent of when it would file the re­port.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman said: “We did not suc­ceed in reach­ing the sec­ond stu­dent. Prior to this, we had also ad­vised the two stu­dents of the op­tion to file their own po­lice re­ports, given the se­ri­ous al­le­ga­tions that they had made about Dr Fer­nando. We suc­cess­fully reached out to both stu­dents after the po­lice re­port was filed to up­date them.”</p>
    <p>NUS had ear­lier said it lodged a po­lice re­port “given the se­ri­ous­ness of the al­le­ga­tions”. It had also ad­vised the two stu­dents to do the same, although both opted not to.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity added that it chose to de­lay mak­ing the re­port out of con­sid­er­a­tion for the stu­dents’ men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said the univer­sity lodged the po­lice re­port to pro­tect its stu­dent body at large.</p>
    <p>“In fil­ing this re­port, NUS takes into con­sid­er­a­tion our obli­ga­tions un­der the law, the need for trans­parency, and the need to pro­tect the pri­vacy and in­ter­ests of all par­ties, in­clud­ing rea­son­able grounds for de­lay,” she said.</p>
    <p>A po­lice re­port was “im­mi­nent”, given that par­tial in­for­ma­tion about the mat­ter was al­ready public, she added, re­fer­ring to al­le­ga­tions raised by the two stu­dents that had been re­ported.</p>
    <p>“NUS also owes a duty of care to its stu­dents at large to en­sure cam­pus safety, and weighed this in our de­ci­sion to file a re­port with­out prior agree­ment of ei­ther stu­dent.</p>
    <p>If an al­le­ga­tion has been made, the po­lice would be best placed to as­sess if an of­fence was com­mit­ted,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Un­der Sec­tion 424 of the Crim­i­nal Procedure Code, any­one aware of the “com­mis­sion or the in­ten­tion of another per­son to com­mit any ar­restable of­fence shall, in the ab­sence of rea­son­able ex­cuse”, im­me­di­ately pro­vide the au­thor­i­ties with in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, lawyers have said it is not clear that NUS was legally obliged to make a po­lice re­port, as var­i­ous fac­tors could be counted as a “rea­son­able ex­cuse”.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the vic­tim’s choice or a pro­fes­sional assess­ment of whether such an in­ves­ti­ga­tion would be in the vic­tim’s in­ter­est, and whether the party mak­ing the re­port has enough first-hand knowl­edge of the of­fence.</p>
    <p>NUS re­ceived a com­plaint about Dr Fer­nando on Aug 27. A sec­ond com­plaint was made on Sept 7.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity sacked him on Oct 7, as its in­ter­nal investigat­ions showed he “had an in­ti­mate as­so­ci­a­tion” with an un­der­grad­u­ate – a se­ri­ous breach of its code of con­duct for staff.</p>
    <p>It later re­leased a public state­ment on Oct 18 – the day staff and stu­dents at Tem­busu Col­lege were told of his dis­missal.</p>
    <p>FAC­TORS FOR CON­SID­ER­A­TION</p>
    <p>In fil­ing this re­port, NUS takes into con­sid­er­a­tion our obli­ga­tions un­der the law, the need for trans­parency, and the need to pro­tect the pri­vacy and in­ter­ests of all par­ties, in­clud­ing rea­son­able grounds for de­lay.</p>
