    <p>The be­hav­iour of some adults re­cently, es­pe­cially dur­ing this week lead­ing up to Na­tional Day, dis­ap­pointed me ter­ri­bly.</p>
    <p>As I was drop­ping my Pri­mary 2 son off at school in Pung­gol, the Na­tional An­them came on over the school’s pub­lic ad­dress sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The school’s vice-prin­ci­pal, who was stand­ing at the school gate, in­structed all her pupils to stop in their tracks and to stand at at­ten­tion. I did like­wise.</p>
    <p>Most of the other par­ents, with their chil­dren in tow, non­cha­lantly car­ried on walk­ing into the school.</p>
    <p>This showed great dis­re­spect for our Na­tional An­them.</p>
    <p>It was a teach­able mo­ment for our young, im­pres­sion­able school­child­ren and not only was it lost, but the par­ents also turned it into an ex­am­ple of de­plorable be­hav­iour by adults who are sup­posed to be role mod­els.</p>
    <p>In the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces, when the Na­tional An­them is played, even mil­i­tary ve­hi­cles have to stop all move­ment and have their en­gines switched off.</p>
    <p>What kind of mes­sage are those adults at the school send­ing to all the chil­dren, in­clud­ing their own?</p>
    <p>It may be nec­es­sary for schools to make an an­nounce­ment that the Na­tional An­them is about to be played, and that ev­ery­one within the school com­pound is re­quired to cease move­ment and to stand at at­ten­tion as a mark of re­spect.</p>
    <p>Pay­ing due re­spect to the Na­tional An­them can­not be a one-off oc­ca­sion re­served for our coun­try’s Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>It must be a feeling all Sin­ga­pore­ans carry in their hearts on a daily ba­sis.</p>
