    <p>The agree­ment be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) to es­tab­lish diplo­matic re­la­tions has stunned the rest of the Mid­dle East, while of­fer­ing sig­nif­i­cant po­lit­i­cal ad­van­tages to the lead­ers of the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It also rep­re­sents a rare pol­icy tri­umph for United States</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who helped bro­ker the ar­range­ment and now claims re­spon­si­bil­ity for what he hailed as a “huge break­through”.</p>
    <p>But the deal has al­ready en­coun­tered fierce op­po­si­tion from coun­tries such as Iran and Tur­key, which have ac­cused the UAE of “be­tray­ing” the Mus­lims’ cause.</p>
    <p>And the ar­range­ment also side­lines the Pales­tini­ans, thereby guar­an­tee­ing fur­ther ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Since its es­tab­lish­ment in 1948, Is­rael has worked hard to be for­mally recog­nised by its Arab neigh­bours, largely be­cause it viewed this as the fi­nal act of ac­cep­tance of the fact that the Jewish state can­not be erased from the map of the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>And, con­versely, with­hold­ing this recog­ni­tion was re­garded by all Arab lead­ers as a po­tent weapon, as the fi­nal and most im­por­tant con­ces­sion to be given to Is­rael only after a so­lu­tion to the plight of the Pales­tini­ans.</p>
    <p>Two key Mid­dle East­ern na­tions broke off from this Arab-wide united front by sign­ing sep­a­rate peace agree­ments with Is­rael: Egypt, which es­tab­lished diplo­matic re­la­tions with the Jewish state in 1980, and Jor­dan, which fol­lowed suit in 1994.</p>
    <p>But all sub­se­quent Is­raeli at­tempts to en­tice oth­ers into sim­i­lar deals failed.</p>
    <p>Seen from this per­spec­tive, there­fore, the es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic re­la­tions with the UAE is big news for Is­rael and par­tic­u­larly for be­lea­guered</p>
    <p>Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu.</p>
    <p>A right-winger, Mr Ne­tanyahu of­ten stood ac­cused of be­ing in­ca­pable of pro­mot­ing a peace deal; by bro­ker­ing one with the UAE, the Is­raeli Premier hopes to dis­pel that image.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu is also fight­ing for his po­lit­i­cal life: He has been charged with cor­rup­tion, and his coali­tion gov­ern­ment may break up, pre­cip­i­tat­ing a third round of gen­eral elec­tions in Is­rael in as many years. The UAE agree­ment – which he kept se­cret from his own min­is­ters – re-es­tab­lishes Mr Ne­tanyahu’s rep­u­ta­tion for spring­ing last-minute sur­prises.</p>
    <p>The deal is also a con­sid­er­able suc­cess for Mr Trump, and par­tic­u­larly for Mr Jared Kush­ner, Mr Trump’s son-in-law, who bro­kered the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Both have long ar­gued that the pro-Western monar­chies of the Gulf share strate­gic in­ter­ests with Is­rael, par­tic­u­larly when it comes to con­fronting Iran.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing the Amer­i­cans with a diplo­matic vic­tory is also the chief rea­son why Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Zayed, who is the real power in the UAE, ac­cepted the sign­ing of the deal; like Mr Trump, he sees Iran and other Mus­lim ex­trem­ists as his coun­try’s big­gest dan­gers.</p>
    <p>He is aware that Mr Trump may lose the US elec­tions in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>But he also knows that Sen­a­tor Joe Bi­den, the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee, is equally obliged to em­brace the deal, since it is pop­u­lar with pro-Is­raeli elec­toral lob­bies in the US.</p>
    <p>This has al­ready hap­pened, with Mr Bi­den hail­ing the UAE’s de­ci­sion to recog­nise Is­rael as a “wel­come, brave and badly needed act of states­man­ship”.</p>
    <p>Crown Prince Mo­hammed may be cal­cu­lat­ing that, re­gard­less of who oc­cu­pies the White House from Jan­uary next year, the UAE will re­main Amer­ica’s favourite ally, and that his deal with Is­rael will al­low his wealthy but other­wise small emi­rate to be a key in­ter­locu­tor for the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>But there are also con­sid­er­able risks for him. The UAE leader has jus­ti­fied the deal to his Arab neigh­bours by claim­ing that, in re­turn for diplo­matic recog­ni­tion, Mr Ne­tanyahu promised to sus­pend plans for the for­mal an­nex­a­tion of Pales­tinian ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Ne­tanyahu claims that he made no such ex­plicit com­mit­ments, and that he had man­aged to bring about this peace agree­ment “with­out qual­i­fi­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore very likely that, in the months to come, Mr Ne­tanyahu will revive his plans for an­nex­a­tion, to the em­bar­rass­ment of Crown Prince Mo­hammed.</p>
    <p>The UAE has also raised the stakes in its con­fronta­tion with Iran and Tur­key; the bit­ter re­sponse from neigh­bour­ing Iran, which ac­cused the UAE of “strate­gic stu­pid­ity” by strik­ing a “dag­ger in the backs of the Pales­tinian peo­ple and all Mus­lims”, is a har­bin­ger of things to come.</p>
    <p>Crown Prince Mo­hammed will have to be sure that he has the sup­port of Saudi Arabia for the diplo­matic storm that his small emi­rate is likely to face.</p>
    <p>And then, there are the Pales­tini­ans who, yet again, have been side­lined by an Arab gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Pales­tinian Pres­i­dent Mah­moud Ab­bas had no fore­warn­ing of what was about to hap­pen, and re­it­er­ated his “re­jec­tion and de­nun­ci­a­tion” of the deal.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, there­fore, no­body should see this deal as a new open­ing for the Mid­dle East.</p>
