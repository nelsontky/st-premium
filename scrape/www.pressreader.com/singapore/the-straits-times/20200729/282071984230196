    <p>It was re­ported last month that all trav­ellers en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore from June 18 would have to take a Covid-19 test, and pay for it (In­bound trav­ellers will have to pay for com­pul­sory test­ing,</p>
    <p>June 16).</p>
    <p>They would be sub­ject to the test a few days be­fore the end of their stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>I am puz­zled as to why they do not have to take the test im­me­di­ately on ar­rival in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and wait for the re­sults be­fore be­ing al­lowed to, for in­stance, take public trans­port.</p>
    <p>How many days does it take for the re­sults to be ready? A cou­ple of days? Why not have th­ese peo­ple wait for the re­sults?</p>
    <p>If they are asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers, they would be en­dan­ger­ing oth­ers while tak­ing public trans­port – first from the air­port to their res­i­dences, and then from their res­i­dences to a com­mu­nity test­ing fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>They may also in­fect those liv­ing in the same house­hold, who may go out and in turn trans­mit the virus to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It should be ob­vi­ous by now that there is no point telling peo­ple to avoid tak­ing public trans­port. In Sin­ga­pore, only en­force­ment ac­tion will work.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, de­spite an­nounce­ments at MRT sta­tions telling commuters to avoid talk­ing to one an­other or on their cell­phones, I have seen adults and school­child­ren chat­ter­ing away.</p>
    <p>That is why the de­ploy­ment of safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors was a good de­ci­sion. Th­ese am­bas­sadors should board the trains in­stead of just stay­ing on the plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Should Sin­ga­pore not for­bid in­bound trav­ellers from tak­ing public trans­port be­fore their Covid-19 test re­sults are out?</p>
