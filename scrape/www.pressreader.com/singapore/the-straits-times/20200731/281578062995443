    <p>In­sta­gram feeds have been over­run by black-and-white im­ages of women both fa­mous and not. These pho­to­graphs are of­ten posed and fil­tered, taken from flat­ter­ing an­gles and ac­com­pa­nied by cap­tions about “sup­port­ing women”. The premise of the trend is that these pho­tos pro­mote fe­male em­pow­er­ment. But there are crit­ics who say it means lit­tle.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Over the past sev­eral days, In­sta­gram feeds have been over­run with black-and-white im­ages of women both fa­mous and not.</p>
    <p>These pho­to­graphs are of­ten posed and fil­tered, taken from flat­ter­ing an­gles and ac­com­pa­nied by be­nign cap­tions about “sup­port­ing women”.</p>
    <p>“Love this sim­ple way to lift each other up. #chal­lengeac­cepted. Thank you for nom­i­nat­ing me @vanessabry­ant,” model Cindy Craw­ford posted on Mon­day, along with a black-and-white photo of her­self strolling on a beach which looked as if it had been ripped from a Calvin Klein ad­ver­tise­ment.</p>
    <p>The premise of the “chal­lenge ac­cepted” trend is that these pho­tos pro­mote fe­male em­pow­er­ment and that nom­i­nat­ing friends to take part in the cam­paign is a way for women to sup­port each other.</p>
    <p>So far, more than three mil­lion pho­tos have been up­loaded with the #Chal­lengeAc­cepted hash­tag; many more have ap­peared with­out it.</p>
    <p>“The trend is still pick­ing up with us­age of the hash­tag on In­sta­gram dou­bling in the last day alone,” an In­sta­gram spokesman said ear­lier in the week. “Based on the posts, we’re see­ing that most of the par­tic­i­pants are post­ing with notes re­lat­ing to strength and sup­port for their com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Many women have in­cluded the hash­tag #womensup­port­ingwomen in their posts.</p>
    <p>“Chal­lenge Ac­cepted,” re­al­i­tyshow star Khloe Kar­dashian wrote in an In­sta­gram post on Sun­day. “To all my Queens – Let’s spread love and re­mem­ber to be a lit­tle kinder to one an­other. #womensup­port­ingwomen.”</p>
    <p>This is not the first ti me In­sta­gram users have lever­aged black-and-white selfies in sup­port of a vague cause. In 2016, blackand-white pho­tos with the #Chal­lengeAc­cepted hash­tag were meant to spread a mes­sage of can­cer aware­ness.</p>
    <p>Over the years, the photo trend has also been used to “spread pos­i­tiv­ity”. The chal­lenge has cir­cu­lated like chain mail. Par­tic­i­pants nom­i­nate at least one other wo­man, and of­ten sev­eral, to post her own black-and-white por­trait.</p>
    <p>Celebri­ties such as ac­tresses Kerry Wash­ing­ton, Jen­nifer Gar­ner, Kris­ten Bell and Eva Lon­go­ria have helped the cam­paign gain vis­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ms Cris­tine Abram, a pub­lic re­la­tions and in­flu­encer mar­ket­ing man­ager for Later, a so­cial me­dia mar­ket­ing firm, said a video of Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez speak­ing out against Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ted Yoho’s sex­ist re­marks against her on the floor of United States Congress last week led to a spike in so­cial me­dia posts about fem­i­nism and fe­male em­pow­er­ment, which may have con­trib­uted to the lat­est round of black-and-white pho­tos.</p>
    <p>“That was the spark that led to the resur­gence of the hash­tag chal­lenge,” Ms Abram said. “It’s all to do with fe­male em­pow­er­ment. There was this hash­tag that al­ready ex­isted to raise aware­ness around other large is­sues. Tap­ping into that al­lowed par­tic­i­pants to gain trac­tion a lot faster be­cause the al­go­rithm was al­ready fa­mil­iar with the hash­tag.”</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive from In­sta­gram said the ear­li­est post the com­pany could sur­face for the cur­rent cy­cle of the chal­lenge was posted a week and a half ago by Brazil­ian jour­nal­ist Ana Paula Padrao.</p>
    <p>Though the por­traits have spread widely, the posts them­selves say very lit­tle. Like the black square, which be­came a sym­bol of sol­i­dar­ity with black peo­ple but asked very lit­tle of those who shared it, the black-and-white selfie al­lows users to feel as if they are tak­ing a stand while say­ing al­most noth­ing.</p>
    <p>In­flu­encers and celebri­ties love such “chal­lenges” be­cause they do not re­quire ac­tual ad­vo­cacy, which might alien­ate cer­tain fac­tions of their fan base.</p>
    <p>“Ladies, in­stead of post­ing that hot black-and-white selfie, why don’t we ease into fem­i­nism with some­thing low stakes, like cut­ting off your friend who’s an abuser?” tweeted writer Alana Levin­son.</p>
    <p>Other women have spo­ken out about the back­lash they have faced for cri­tiquing the trend.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently get­ting hate mail on In­sta­gram from com­plete strangers be­cause I said black and white selfies aren’t a cause,” tweeted pod­cast host Ali Segel. “Ap­par­ently I hate women and don’t love my­self. I’m mind­ing my own busi­ness for the rest of my life.”</p>
    <p>“I think that if this ‘move­ment’ fea­tured trans women or dif­fer­ently abled women, or show­cased fe­male busi­nesses or ac­com­plish­ments or women in his­tory, it would make more sense,” Segel ex­plained fur­ther, in a di­rect mes­sage on Twit­ter. “But the idea of this as a chal­lenge or cause is re­ally lost on me.”</p>
    <p>Other women sug­gested that, in­stead of a selfie, women should share pho­tos of books, ar­ti­cles, prod­ucts and char­i­ties that ben­e­fit women. A few won­dered whether the trend had been started by men.</p>
    <p>TV writer Camilla Black­ett sug­gested that the cam­paign was lit­tle more than a ve­hi­cle for at­trac­tive pho­tos. “What is the point of this #Chal­lengeAc­cepted thing?” she tweeted. “Do peo­ple not know you can just post a hot selfie for no rea­son?”</p>
