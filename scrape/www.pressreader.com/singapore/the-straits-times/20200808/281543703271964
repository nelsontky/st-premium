    <p>For­mer Malaysian fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng was charged yes­ter­day at the Spe­cial Cor­rup­tion Court with so­lic­it­ing a bribe over a con­tro­ver­sial RM6.3 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$2.1 bil­lion) un­der­sea tun­nel project dur­ing his ten­ure as Pe­nang chief min­is­ter. He pleaded not guilty. He had been ar­rested on Thursday night.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng was charged yes­ter­day at the Spe­cial Cor­rup­tion Court for so­lic­it­ing a bribe over a con­tro­ver­sial RM6.3 bil­lion (S$2.1 bil­lion) un­der­sea tun­nel project dur­ing his ten­ure as Pe­nang chief min­is­ter. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion leader was ar­rested on Thursday night at the Malaysian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion (MACC) head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>The charge sheet al­leged that he had asked for a bribe of 10 per cent of fu­ture prof­its from a com­pany that was awarded a con­tract to build the un­der­sea tun­nel.</p>
    <p>Lim, 59 – who is also sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), which has the most seats in Par­lia­ment – is sched­uled to be charged with fur­ther of­fences at a Pe­nang ses­sions court next Mon­day and Tues­day, the MACC said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The anti-graft agency said next Mon­day’s charges are re­lated to the un­der­sea tun­nel project, while the Tues­day charge in­volves an un­spec­i­fied case.</p>
    <p>If found guilty of the tun­nel project charges, Lim could be jailed for up to 20 years, and fined not less than five times the value of the bribe or RM10,000, which­ever is higher. The bail was set at RM1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Lim was Pe­nang chief min­is­ter from 2008 to 2018, and early stud­ies for the tun­nel, de­signed to link But­ter­worth on the main­land to Ge­orge­town on Pe­nang is­land, be­gan dur­ing his ad­min­is­tra­tion in 2016.</p>
    <p>Lim told re­porters af­ter the court ses­sion: “This is a base­less al­le­ga­tion and it is po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated to tar­nish and smear my rep­u­ta­tion. I want to stress that I have never re­ceived any grat­i­fi­ca­tion and I have said this to MACC and they never asked me to show proof of whether I got mil­lions or bil­lions of ring­git in my bank ac­count or whether I had mil­lions of ring­git in cash in my pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“This project was by open ten­der, not by di­rect award, and to date not a sin­gle sen has been paid for the tun­nel project.</p>
    <p>“I will fight to prove my in­no­cence in court. I be­lieve that the truth will show that I have not re­ceived any grat­i­fi­ca­tion and there is no cor­rup­tion.”</p>
    <p>Lim’s son Mar­cus yes­ter­day al­leged that his fa­ther’s ar­rest was a po­lit­i­cal plot to un­der­mine the op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion.</p>
    <p>He said the fam­ily had ex­pected this to hap­pen since the Fe­bru­ary col­lapse of the PH gov­ern­ment, in which Lim had served as fi­nance min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“Their plan is sim­ple, to frame and cap­ture those lead­ers who wouldn’t bow down to their dirty scheme,” Mr Mar­cus Lim wrote on Facebook.</p>
    <p>DAP MP Tony Pua said the al­le­ga­tions against Lim were a form of po­lit­i­cal per­se­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>The MACC had called Lim in for ques­tion­ing on three sep­a­rate days lead­ing up to the charge, and ques­tioned sev­eral prom­i­nent Pe­nang politi­cians in re­cent weeks, in­clud­ing Lim’s suc­ces­sor as chief min­is­ter, Mr Chow Kon Yeow.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Star news daily, the MACC is look­ing into al­le­ga­tions that the state gov­ern­ment al­lowed the Pe­nang Tun­nel spe­cial pur­pose ve­hi­cle (SPV) com­pany to sell state land rights worth RM3 bil­lion de­spite a four-year de­lay in the con­struc­tion of roads.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors are also said to be look­ing into the fea­si­bil­ity and de­tailed de­sign stud­ies that have yet to be com­pleted, even though pay­ment of RM220 mil­lion was al­legedly made to the SPV com­pany.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time Lim has been charged with graft.</p>
    <p>He faced cor­rup­tion charges over the pur­chase of a bun­ga­low be­low the mar­ket price in 2016, but these were con­tro­ver­sially dropped in 2018 by then At­tor­ney­Gen­eral Tommy Thomas, af­ter PH won fed­eral power.</p>
    <p>De facto Law Min­is­ter Takiyud­din Has­san re­cently said the MACC could re­new the probe into the bun­ga­low pur­chase if new ev­i­dence emerges.</p>
