    <p>As the election loomed, my fel­low democ­racy ex­perts and I were of­ten asked: “What is the right his­tor­i­cal anal­ogy to Amer­ica’s cur­rent cri­sis?”</p>
    <p>The truth is, there is no prece­dent. We have never seen such a long­stand­ing democ­racy in such a rich coun­try break down be­fore – never. But it could hap­pen this year.</p>
    <p>The vul­ner­a­bil­ity of Amer­ica’s democ­racy to­day doesn’t come in the form that many feared when Mr Don­ald Trump was elected in 2016.</p>
    <p>The good news is that two of the three pil­lars of Amer­i­can democ­racy – lib­erty and the rule of law – en­dure, even if they have been bat­tered. But the third pil­lar – free and fair elec­tions – is un­der far more di­rect threat than my fel­low democ­racy ex­perts pre­dicted.</p>
    <p>De­spite lib­er­als’ wor­ries, the United States has not de­scended into fas­cism. The Pres­i­dent has re­peat­edly called to “lock up” or ar­rest his po­lit­i­cal ri­vals, but the Jus­tice De­part­ment – how­ever com­pro­mised its lead­er­ship at the top – has not com­plied.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­lent­lessly de­nounced the news me­dia as the “en­emy of the peo­ple”, but Amer­ica’s vi­brant free press con­tin­ues to ex­pose one White House scan­dal after another. And civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions re­main free to ad­vo­cate civil rights, the en­vi­ron­ment and other causes. Lib­erty re­mains es­sen­tially in­tact.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has in­flicted more dam­age to the rule of law. He has im­pugned the in­tegrity of judges who have ruled against him. He has de­manded loy­alty to him­self – not the law or Con­sti­tu­tion – from Fed­eral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) di­rec­tors, in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials, mil­i­tary com­man­ders and his at­tor­neys-gen­eral.</p>
    <p>He has re­placed five in­spec­tors-gen­eral in­ves­ti­gat­ing wrong­do­ing in his ad­min­is­tra­tion, with­held his tax re­turns, par­doned his po­lit­i­cal al­lies con­victed of felonies, and nor­malised ly­ing and in­flam­ma­tory tweets as modes of pres­i­den­tial com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>And re­cently, he is­sued an ex­ec­u­tive or­der un­der­min­ing the po­lit­i­cal neu­tral­ity and ca­reer pro­tec­tions of thou­sands of se­nior civil ser­vants. Yet the ju­di­ciary has re­tained con­sid­er­able in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>In June, Mr Trump’s first two Supreme Court nom­i­nees, Mr Neil Gor­such and Mr Brett Ka­vanaugh, joined a seven-to-two ma­jor­ity rul­ing that the Pres­i­dent wasn’t im­mune from a New York state sub­poena for his fi­nan­cial doc­u­ments. So far, FBI di­rec­tor Christo­pher Wray has qui­etly but pro­fes­sion­ally par­ried Mr Trump’s de­mands for “loy­alty” and de­fended the agency’s au­ton­omy. As a re­sult, Mr Trump has not (yet) be­come a true au­to­crat.</p>
    <p>Il­lib­eral pop­ulists such as Hun­gary’s Vik­tor Or­ban and Turkey’s Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan have grad­u­ally stran­gled their democ­ra­cies by fol­low­ing an au­thor­i­tar­ian play­book: con­trol the courts by ap­point­ing sub­servient judges; con­quer the in­de­pen­dent me­dia by cor­rupt­ing or threat­en­ing its own­ers; in­tim­i­date busi­ness lead­ers into ceas­ing sup­port of the po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion; ter­rorise civil so­ci­ety groups into muf­fling their dis­sent; and as­sert per­sonal po­lit­i­cal con­trol over law en­force­ment and in­tel­li­gence agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump hasn’t got very far in im­ple­ment­ing that play­book, though he might well have more suc­cess if he is re-elected.</p>
    <p>WHY THIRD PIL­LAR MAY BUCKLE</p>
    <p>But the third pil­lar of Amer­i­can democ­racy – the one most taken for granted – is most at risk: free and fair elec­tions. The dan­ger em­anates from a sin­gu­lar com­bi­na­tion of events, the worst pan­demic in a cen­tury and the most un­demo­cratic pres­i­dent in US his­tory.</p>
    <p>With Democrats ac­count­ing for a much larger share of mail-in bal­lots than Repub­li­cans, Mr Trump has re­peat­edly chal­lenged the le­git­i­macy of these votes.</p>
    <p>If he is leading even nar­rowly on election night, he could claim vic­tory based only on the votes so far counted – even though Mr Joe Bi­den might well be on course to win when all valid votes are counted.</p>
    <p>Worse, Mr Trump might pres­sure the Republican leg­is­la­tures in bat­tle­ground states, like Penn­syl­va­nia and Florida, to award him their state’s elec­tors, even if the for­mal vote-count­ing ma­chin­ery ul­ti­mately de­clares a Bi­den vic­tory in the state.</p>
    <p>Then it would fall to the courts and Congress (un­der the terms of the in­scrutable, badly writ­ten Elec­toral Count Act of 1887) to de­ter­mine who had won in the dis­puted states.</p>
    <p>Such a sce­nario would be far more dire and po­lar­is­ing than even the Bush v Gore night­mare of 2000, with an in­cum­bent pres­i­dent threat­en­ing fire and brim­stone if the election were not handed to him, while sig­nalling vi­o­lent right-wing ex­trem­ists to “stand by” but per­haps no longer “stand down”.</p>
    <p>Many on the left would no longer be will­ing to let the pres­i­dency (in their eyes) be stolen from them again, and far-left groups might revel in the chance to worsen the cri­sis. The po­ten­tial for vi­o­lence would be alarm­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­tegrity of the election is fur­ther chal­lenged by the ris­ing pace of voter sup­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>In 2013, the Supreme Court gut­ted the Vot­ing Rights Act, throw­ing out the for­mula re­quir­ing nine states (and other lo­cal­i­ties) with a his­tory of racist voter sup­pres­sion to ob­tain fed­eral per­mis­sion be­fore chang­ing their vot­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Since then, these and other Republican-con­trolled states have im­posed le­gal and ad­min­is­tra­tive changes that have made vot­ing more dif­fi­cult for black Amer­i­cans, His­pan­ics, young peo­ple and city dwellers – all heav­ily Demo­cratic con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>It would be un­demo­cratic enough for the loser of the na­tional pop­u­lar vote to again be elected (for the third time in the past six pres­i­den­tial elec­tions) by win­ning the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>But if Mr Trump were to win re-election by nar­rowly pre­vail­ing in two or three states through ex­ten­sive disqual­i­fi­ca­tion of mail-in bal­lots or through voter sup­pres­sion, the le­git­i­macy of the 2020 election could be ques­tioned far more in­tensely than those of 2000 or 2016.</p>
    <p>And if Mr Trump failed to win the Elec­toral Col­lege but was nonethe­less de­clared pres­i­dent thanks to par­ti­san elec­tors, it would sig­nify a grave break­down of Amer­i­can democ­racy – even if peo­ple re­mained free to speak, write and pub­lish as they pleased.</p>
    <p>LESSONS FROM ABROAD</p>
    <p>The very age of Amer­i­can democ­racy is part of the prob­lem. The US was the first coun­try to be­come a democ­racy, emerg­ing over a vast, dis­persed and di­verse set of colonies that feared the prospect of the “tyranny of the ma­jor­ity”.</p>
    <p>Thus, its con­sti­tu­tional sys­tem lacks some im­mu­ni­ties – which are com­mon in newer democ­ra­cies – against an elec­toral de­ba­cle.</p>
    <p>Even though Mex­ico is a fed­eral sys­tem like the US, it has a strong, po­lit­i­cally in­de­pen­dent Na­tional Elec­toral In­sti­tute that ad­min­is­ters its fed­eral elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Election Com­mis­sion of In­dia has even more far-reach­ing and con­sti­tu­tion­ally pro­tected au­thor­ity to ad­min­is­ter elec­tions across that enor­mous coun­try. Elec­tions thus re­main a cru­cial pil­lar of Indian democ­racy, even as pop­ulist Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi as­saults press free­dom, civil so­ci­ety and the rule of law.</p>
    <p>Other newer democ­ra­cies, from South Africa to Tai­wan, have strong na­tional sys­tems of election ad­min­is­tra­tion staffed and led by non-par­ti­san pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can sys­tem is a mish­mash of state and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties. Most are staffed by ded­i­cated pro­fes­sion­als, but state leg­is­la­tures and elected sec­re­taries of state can in­tro­duce par­ti­san­ship, cast­ing doubt on the sys­tem’s im­par­tial­ity.</p>
    <p>No other ad­vanced democ­racy falls so short of con­tem­po­rary demo­cratic stan­dards of fair­ness, neu­tral­ity and ra­tio­nal­ity in its sys­tem of ad­min­is­ter­ing na­tional elec­tions.</p>
    <p>More re­cent demo­cratic coun­tries have adopted con­sti­tu­tional pro­vi­sions to strengthen checks and bal­ances.</p>
    <p>Like many newer democ­ra­cies, Latvia has es­tab­lished a strong, in­de­pen­dent anti-cor­rup­tion bu­reau, which has in­ves­tiga­tive, pre­ven­tive and ed­u­ca­tional func­tions and a sub­stan­tial bud­get and staff. It even over­sees po­lit­i­cal and cam­paign fi­nance.</p>
    <p>South Africa has the in­de­pen­dent Of­fice of the Public Pro­tec­tor to per­form a sim­i­lar role.</p>
    <p>The US has no com­pa­ra­ble stand­ing au­thor­ity to in­ves­ti­gate na­tional-level cor­rup­tion, and Congress largely in­ves­ti­gates and pun­ishes it­self.</p>
    <p>Newer democ­ra­cies also take mea­sures to de­politi­cise the con­sti­tu­tional court. No other democ­racy gives life ten­ure to such a pow­er­ful po­si­tion as con­sti­tu­tional court jus­tice.</p>
    <p>In other democ­ra­cies, con­sti­tu­tional court jus­tices ei­ther face term lim­its (12 years in Ger­many and South Africa; eight in Tai­wan) or age lim­its (70 years in Aus­tralia, Is­rael and South Korea; 75 in Canada), or both.</p>
    <p>Ger­many de­politi­cises nom­i­na­tions to its con­sti­tu­tional court by re­quir­ing broad par­lia­men­tary con­sen­sus. In other democ­ra­cies, a broader com­mit­tee nom­i­nates Supreme Court jus­tices. In Is­rael, this in­volves not just the ex­ec­u­tive branch but also Par­lia­ment, some of the ex­ist­ing jus­tices, and the Bar as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Many of these ideas sim­ply didn’t oc­cur to Amer­ica’s founders, who were fram­ing a modern democ­racy for the first time, for a largely ru­ral so­ci­ety with more lim­ited lev­els of ed­u­ca­tion, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and life ex­pectancy.</p>
    <p>NEAR THE PRECIPICE</p>
    <p>The re­sult is that Amer­i­can democ­racy lacks na­tional checks on ex­ec­u­tive cor­rup­tion and na­tional guar­an­tees of elec­toral in­tegrity that have be­come rou­tine in other democ­ra­cies. And nom­i­na­tions to the US Supreme Court have be­come far more politi­cised than in many peer democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>Through­out most of its his­tory, Amer­ica’s demo­cratic norms have been strong enough and the out­comes clear enough to avoid cat­a­strophic con­flict over a na­tional election.</p>
    <p>But sev­eral times (most no­tably with the Hayes v Tilden pres­i­den­tial election of 1876), it ap­proached the precipice – and avoided fall­ing off only through luck and painful com­pro­mises.</p>
    <p>To­day, it is far closer to a break­down than most democ­racy ex­perts, my­self in­cluded, would have dared an­tic­i­pate just a few years ago. Even if Amer­ica is spared the worst, it is long past time to re­new the mech­a­nisms of its democ­racy, learn from other democ­ra­cies around the world and again make this repub­lic a shin­ing city on a hill.</p>
