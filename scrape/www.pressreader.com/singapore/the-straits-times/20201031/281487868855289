    <p>JO­HOR BARU • The Jo­hor Baru district has been de­clared a red zone af­ter the num­ber of Covid-19 cases sur­passed 40 in a span of 14 days.</p>
    <p>The district in­cludes Jo­hor Baru city cen­tre – lo­cated just af­ter the Cause­way – and the Iskan­dar Pu­teri town­ship (for­merly called Nusa­jaya), which is pop­u­lar with Sin­ga­porean home buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor Health and En­vi­ron­ment Com­mit­tee chair­man R. Vidyanan­than said there will be in­creased sur­veil­lance there as the num­ber of in­fec­tions is ex­pected to rise.</p>
    <p>“The Jo­hor Baru district was de­clared a red zone on Thurs­day. Based on in­for­ma­tion, most of the cases re­ported in­volved the spread of the dis­ease among fam­ily mem­bers and at work­places.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of this, the state health depart­ment has placed the in­sti­tu­tions in­volved un­der a home sur­veil­lance or­der,” Mr Vidyanan­than said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added that there were 10 new cases on Thurs­day, in­clud­ing nine from ex­ist­ing clus­ters.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion of the red zone is likely a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure be­cause un­like other red zones in the coun­try, the au­thor­i­ties have not im­posed any re­stric­tions on move­ments.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial trucks car­ry­ing ne­ces­si­ties like food prod­ucts are still able to tra­verse be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore for now.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and the states</p>
    <p>of Sabah and Se­lan­gor were also de­clared red zones ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>They were placed un­der a con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) start­ing from Oct 14 as the coun­try bat­tled a third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions. Un­der the CMCO, so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties and cross-district travel are barred, and only two i ndi­vid­u­als are al­lowed to leave a res­i­dence at a time.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally i mposed for t wo weeks, the CMCO in those ar­eas has since been ex­tended to Nov 7 as the num­ber of cases re­mains high.</p>
    <p>Mr Vidyanan­than noted that there are cur­rently three ac­tive clus­ters in Jo­hor Baru – the Bayu, Kem­pas and Rint­ing clus­ters.</p>
    <p>Al­though the dec­la­ra­tion of a red zone may not have an im­pact on res­i­dents yet, it may jeop­ar­dise the fur­ther re­open­ing of the Malaysia-Sin­ga­pore bor­der at the Cause­way and Sec­ond Link. This comes at a time when the au­thor­i­ties in Jo­hor Baru are ea­ger to re­vive busi­nesses and re­pair an econ­omy se­verely dam­aged by the clo­sure of one of the world’s busiest land cross­ings.</p>
    <p>In July, both Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ments fi­nalised agree­ments to im­ple­ment two schemes: The re­cip­ro­cal green lane for trav­ellers on short-term vis­its, and the longer-term pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment. Th­ese schemes were im­ple­mented on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor Men­teri Be­sar Hasni Mo­ham­mad has re­peat­edly urged the Malaysian govern­ment to speed up the re­open­ing of the bor­der with Sin­ga­pore as he said Jo­hor’s econ­omy con­tin­ues to con­tract, with the state ex­pected to record its low­est growth in a decade by year end.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has been record­ing triple-digit Covid-19 cases daily since late last month, with 799 new cases re­ported yes­ter­day. There are a to­tal of 30,889 cases so far.</p>
    <p>Sabah has the high­est num­ber of in­fec­tions at 466, fol­lowed by Se­lan­gor (150), Labuan (65) and Pe­nang (35), said Health Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah. Three new deaths were recorded yes­ter­day, bring­ing Malaysia’s to­tal to 249.</p>
    <p>The lat­est wave of in­fec­tions was caused by the two weeks of cam­paign­ing that pre­ceded the Sept 26 Sabah state polls, which drew politi­cians and elec­tion work­ers from all over Malaysia to the coun­try’s east­ern­most state at a time when the state was strug­gling to con­tain a spike in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Th­ese politi­cians and elec­tion work­ers have been blamed for car­ry­ing the virus back with them to Penin­su­lar Malaysia and Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Separately, a pri­mary school in Jo­hor Baru has been told to shut for a week, start­ing from yes­ter­day, af­ter one of its pupils tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>CASES CEN­TRED AROUND FAM­I­LIES, WORK­PLACES</p>
    <p>The Jo­hor Baru district was de­clared a red zone on Thurs­day. Based on in­for­ma­tion, most of the cases re­ported in­volved the spread of the dis­ease among fam­ily mem­bers and at work­places. Be­cause of this, the state health depart­ment has placed the in­sti­tu­tions in­volved un­der a home sur­veil­lance or­der.</p>
