    <p>HONG KONG The Hong Kong govern­ment will em­power doc­tors to man­date Covid-19 tests for pa­tients sus­pected of hav­ing been in­fected by the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure will start to­mor­row and last till Dec 11, Sec­re­tary for Food and Health Sophia Chan said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing peo­ple to heed their doc­tors’ in­struc­tions, she stressed that get­ting tested early is im­por­tant in stop­ping silent trans­mis­sion within the com­mu­nity, pub­lic broad­caster RTHK re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan had said ear­lier that doc­tors would act ac­cord­ing to their pro­fes­sional judg­ment in de­cid­ing who should be tested.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal news por­tal HK01 re­ported that doc­tors are re­quired to sub­mit the names and con­tact de­tails of pa­tients who need to be tested to the health au­thor­i­ties for fol­low-up.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes as Hong Kong bat­tles a fourth wave of in­fec­tions, with a fast-ex­pand­ing clus­ter linked to at least 21 dance stu­dios.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 250 peo­ple linked to the stu­dios have tested pos­i­tive for the coronaviru­s as at Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>By the end of Wed­nes­day, Hong Kong had a cu­mu­la­tive to­tal of 5,866 con­firmed Covid-19 cases, in­clud­ing 108 deaths.</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment out­lets, in­clud­ing bars and night­clubs, are shut for seven days start­ing from yes­ter­day – the third time since the pan­demic be­gan – to con­tain the grow­ing dance stu­dio clus­ter.</p>
    <p>In her an­nual pol­icy ad­dress on</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day, Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said it is es­sen­tial to take all nec­es­sary mea­sures to strengthen epi­demic con­trol so as to achieve “zero in­fec­tion”.</p>
    <p>“On break­ing the virus trans­mis­sion chain in the com­mu­nity, we man­date high-risk groups to un­dergo virus tests, and will pro­vide vol­un­tary virus test­ing ser­vice for peo­ple with­out symp­toms on a wider scale, or may even im­ple­ment a large-scale uni­ver­sal com­mu­nity test­ing again in a bid to achieve the tar­get of zero in­fec­tion,” Mrs Lam said.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing al­most one year of our fight against the epi­demic, Hong Kong has re­mained vig­i­lant and com­mit­ted.”</p>
