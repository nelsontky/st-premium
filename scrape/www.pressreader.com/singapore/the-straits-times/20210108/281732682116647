    <p>Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port will be closed for two weeks from to­day af­ter a sec­ond un­linked Covid-19 case – a Malaysian work­ing at the ho­tel’s Azur restau­rant – emerged.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day said it is clos­ing the ho­tel un­til Jan 21 as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, as it can­not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity that trans­mis­sions could have oc­curred at the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel will stop ac­cept­ing new guests, and for­eign air crew and guests cur­rently stay­ing at the ho­tel will be checked out pro­gres­sively, said MOH.</p>
    <p>In­com­ing air crew will be housed in al­ter­na­tive fa­cil­i­ties, it added.</p>
    <p>Restau­rant and event spa­ces within the ho­tel will also be closed, and deep clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion car­ried out. MOH has also started to test all staff work­ing at the ho­tel for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond case at Azur is a 43-year-old Malaysian woman who de­liv­ers pre-packed meals to air crew and ho­tel guests. She was one of two un­linked com­mu­nity cases re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The work per­mit holder is the sec­ond Azur em­ployee to test pos­i­tive for the in­fec­tion af­ter a Korean na­tional was con­firmed as a Covid-19 pa­tient on Wed­nes­day. Like the Korean, she does not in­ter­act with din­ers at the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>MOH said she de­vel­oped symp­toms while at work on Sun­day and went on Tues­day to a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clinic, where she was tested. Her re­sult came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion the next day, and she was taken to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases in an am­bu­lance.</p>
    <p>Her sero­log­i­cal test re­sult has come back neg­a­tive, in­di­cat­ing this is likely a cur­rent in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­veal that she is prob­a­bly not in­fected with the more in­fec­tious Bri­tish strain of Covid-19, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond com­mu­nity case is a 63-year-old cargo op­er­a­tor at AirMark Avi­a­tion who is based at Dnata Cargo Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>He mainly han­dles load­ing and un­load­ing of cargo for My Indo Air­lines, and does not in­ter­act with flight pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>He de­vel­oped symp­toms on Mon­day and sought treat­ment at Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal on Wed­nes­day. He was con­firmed to be pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on the same day and warded. His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult is pend­ing.</p>
    <p>There were also 31 im­ported cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,813. The 31 com­prise four Sin­ga­pore­ans, three per­ma­nent res­i­dents, three de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers, two work pass hold­ers and 19 work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>They tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing stay-home no­tice or in iso­la­tion af­ter their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH.</p>
    <p>They came from sev­eral coun­tries, in­clud­ing In­dia, Bangladesh and In­done­sia. Ex­cept for one case, all were placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The work per­mit holder ar­rived from Bangladesh on Dec 22 last year but could not clear im­mi­gra­tion due to in­com­plete doc­u­men­ta­tion. He was held at a fa­cil­ity lo­cated at the air­port’s transit area un­til Dec 24, and taken to a ded­i­cated stay-home no­tice fa­cil­ity af­ter the is­sues were re­solved.</p>
