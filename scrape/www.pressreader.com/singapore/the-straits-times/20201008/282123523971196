    <p>An In­done­sian do­mes­tic worker who stabbed her em­ployer more than 90 times was ac­cused by a pros­e­cu­tor yes­ter­day of hav­ing lied to a psy­chi­a­trist to get a favourable di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati told de­fence psy­chi­a­trist Tommy Tan last year that she was hav­ing night­mares as a re­sult of be­ing re­peat­edly raped by her older brother when she was a teenager. But Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Wong Kok Weng said this was the first time since her ar­rest in 2016 that she had men­tioned the night­mares.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati, whose doc­u­mented age is 28 but claims to be two years younger, is on trial for mur­der­ing Madam Seow Kim Choo, 59, at her Telok Ku­rau house on June 7, 2016.</p>
    <p>In April, she ad­mit­ted to a re­duced mur­der charge, which car­ries life im­pris­on­ment or the death sen­tence, with pros­e­cu­tors say­ing they were not press­ing for cap­i­tal pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>Last month, she with­drew her guilty plea in the hope of get­ting a lower sen­tence by call­ing Dr Tan to tes­tify that she had a men­tal con­di­tion that di­min­ished her re­spon­si­bil­ity for her ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the pros­e­cu­tion sought to show that Dary­ati was not truth­ful in her ac­count to Dr Tan, who saw her three times in Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>DPP Wong noted that Dary­ati did not tell In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health psy­chi­a­trist Jay­dip Sarkar that she was hav­ing night­mares when he saw her three times in June and July 2016.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati said Dr Sarkar did not ask fur­ther ques­tions about her feel­ings af­ter the rape incidents, whereas Dr Tan asked if she had dreams af­ter the incidents.</p>
    <p>But the pros­e­cu­tor pointed out that Dary­ati had told Dr Sarkar she felt an­gry and frus­trated about the abuse. “I see no rea­son why you could not have told him that you were also hav­ing night­mares,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati replied: “It’s not easy for me to open up to him be­cause he’s not close to me.”</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor also pro­duced med­i­cal records to show that Dary­ati did not tell prison doc­tors she was hav­ing night­mares un­til af­ter she saw Dr Tan. But Dr Tan had said in his report that Dary­ati told him she had re­ported the night­mares to prison doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati told the court that she could not re­mem­ber when she told prison doc­tors about the night­mares.</p>
