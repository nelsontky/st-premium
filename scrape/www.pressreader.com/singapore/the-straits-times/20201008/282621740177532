    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Warner Bros said it is de­lay­ing the re­lease of Dune and The Bat­man movies – an­other set­back for the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try hit by pan­demic lock­downs and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures that have closed the­atres world­wide.</p>
    <p>The movie in­dus­try re­ceived a jolt on Mon­day when Cineworld, the world’s sec­ond-big­gest cin­ema chain, said it would close its movie the­atres in Bri­tain and the United States, blam­ing the re­luc­tance of stu­dios to go ahead with ma­jor re­leases for the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>But AMC En­ter­tain­ment, the world’s No. 1 chain, said on Tues­day that most of its the­atres in the US and Europe would re­main open.</p>
    <p>Movie stu­dios have de­layed re­leas­ing tent­pole projects even af­ter re­stric­tions were eased, as peo­ple re­main wary of step­ping into cin­ema halls and many the­atres still re­main closed.</p>
    <p>Dune, a sci-fi movie di­rected by Cana­dian di­rec­tor De­nis Vil­leneuve, is now sched­uled to open in Oc­to­ber next year, in­stead of</p>
    <p>De­cem­ber. The re­lease of The Bat­man, star­ring 34-year-old English ac­tor Robert Pat­tin­son, has been moved to the spring of 2022 from Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, the film­ing of The Bat­man was shut down for two weeks af­ter a mem­ber of the pro­duc­tion – widely re­ported to be Pat­tin­son – tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. Film­ing re­sumed in Bri­tain last month and Warner Bros never con­firmed or de­nied re­ports about the ac­tor’s di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Dune has gained a lot of trac­tion for its cast that in­cludes Ti­mothee Cha­la­met, 24, who was nom­i­nated for an Academy Award for his role in Call Me By Your Name (2017).</p>
    <p>Warner Bros’ Tenet, di­rected by Christo­pher Nolan, did get a the­atri­cal re­lease but only af­ter mul­ti­ple de­lays, while Won­der Woman 1984 has been pushed back.</p>
    <p>The re­lease of the new James Bond movie No Time To Die from MGM and Com­cast Corp’s Uni­ver­sal Pic­tures has also been de­layed un­til April next year.</p>
