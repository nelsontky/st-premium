    <p>In or­der to im­prove your run­ning and fit­ness lev­els, it is im­por­tant to track your progress dili­gently and be in touch with how your body feels.</p>
    <p>With this, you will be able to re­ward your­self for the small progress you make and also work on ar­eas in which you are weaker. Ask your­self these ques­tions: • Am I run­ning at a faster pace com­pared to a month ago?</p>
    <p>• Have I been keep­ing up with my train­ing con­sis­tently?</p>
    <p>• Has my en­durance im­proved? How much longer can I run with­out stop­ping for a re­cov­ery walk?</p>
    <p>• Am I im­prov­ing on my hill climbs?</p>
    <p>• How do I feel after my runs?</p>
    <p>Keep­ing a train­ing log is one of the best ways to track your progress and stay mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Some data to note would be the distance cov­ered, run­ning pace and a small sec­tion to record your ef­fort and how you feel about the run.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to past data will re­mind you of how much you have ac­com­plished and whether you are on track to achiev­ing your goal.</p>
    <p>Here are some ways to track your run­ning progress:</p>
    <p>USE A FIXED DISTANCE</p>
    <p>Keep­ing track of your tim­ing over a fixed distance (ide­ally set up a base train­ing route as your test) would be the most di­rect and eas­i­est way to track your progress.</p>
    <p>Ide­ally, the start and end points should be con­sis­tent for ev­ery one of these runs and it would be good to run around the same time of the day to min­imise vari­ables which may af­fect the re­sults.</p>
    <p>USE A FIXED TIME</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, you may track the distance you run in a fixed du­ra­tion (for ex­am­ple, run­ning for 30 min­utes).</p>
    <p>How­ever, keep in mind that the data from our GPS de­vices may not be the most ac­cu­rate due to dead spots.</p>
    <p>There­fore, run­ning on a track would def­i­nitely be ideal in ob­tain­ing a more ac­cu­rate mea­sure­ment of the mileage clocked within the set du­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>MON­I­TOR YOUR EF­FORTS</p>
    <p>Tak­ing note of how much ef­fort you re­quire to per­form a sim­i­lar work­out at dif­fer­ent times would be an­other in­di­ca­tor to gauge your progress. As your fit­ness im­proves and you be­come stronger, run­ning at the same pace as be­fore will feel eas­ier.</p>
    <p>By iden­ti­fy­ing the dif­fer­ences in how you feel and how your body re­acts dur­ing and after the work­outs, you will be able to track your progress eas­ily.</p>
    <p>DATA IN­DI­CA­TORS</p>
    <p>Some in­di­ca­tors you can use from your work­outs would be your av­er­age heart rate, breath­ing pat­tern, as well as mus­cle-fa­tigue lev­els. As most smart watches (and all step track­ers from the Health Pro­mo­tion Board) are equipped with a heart-rate mon­i­tor, it is easy to use this data to track your progress.</p>
    <p>If you are mon­i­tor­ing your heart rate, it is best to mon­i­tor it over a pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>A re­duc­tion in av­er­age heart rate over time for work­outs of sim­i­lar in­ten­sity in­di­cates that your over­all fit­ness has im­proved and your car­dio­vas­cu­lar sys­tem is stronger.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an im­por­tant note to keep in mind is that there can be other fac­tors, such as ad­e­quate rest and hy­dra­tion, that could pos­si­bly af­fect your av­er­age heart rate read­ing.</p>
