    <p>My toi­let-trained Jack Rus­sell ter­rier (left) is very mis­chievous and ac­tive, and reg­u­larly uri­nates in her own bed, es­pe­cially when it has been freshly washed and pre­pared for her. She is 15 years old and has not been neutered. She also uri­nates at the des­ig­nated area where she has been trained to use. Ken­neth Lim</p>
    <p>Did your dog start uri­nat­ing in her own bed re­cently or has she done so since she was a puppy?</p>
    <p>Does it hap­pen ac­ci­den­tally, such as a small amount when your pet is asleep, or is it in­ten­tional?</p>
    <p>These are im­por­tant ques­tions to an­swer as the likely causes are dif­fer­ent in each case. It is gen­er­ally not nor­mal for a dog to uri­nate in her own bed.</p>
    <p>In­ten­tional uri­na­tion on her own bed may suggest an un­der­ly­ing be­havioural cause, as dogs may uri­nate on things to mark their ter­ri­tory. This is more com­mon in males than fe­males.</p>
    <p>Do you have other dogs or pets in the home? Has some­thing in the home changed re­cently which may have caused some anx­i­ety?</p>
    <p>Rec­ti­fy­ing these po­ten­tial sources of stress may al­le­vi­ate this un­wanted be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>There are a num­ber of un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions which may lead to the uri­na­tion is­sues, in­clud­ing uri­nary tract in­fec­tions and stones, di­a­betes, kid­ney and in­con­ti­nence is­sues.</p>
    <p>As pets age, reg­u­lar vet­eri­nary checks will help de­tect med­i­cal con­di­tions early.</p>
