    <p>Sharp-eyed Sin­ga­pore­ans would have spot­ted the unique designs on the red-and-white silk cot­ton scarf and colour­ful enamel brooch that Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob donned at the Padang pa­rade yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Each of the two ac­ces­sories in­cor­po­rated the designs of two artists with vis­ual im­pair­ments – Ms Katy Lee, 70, and Ms Ade­line Ve­jaletchmy, 58 – from the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of the Vis­ually Hand­i­capped.</p>
    <p>Their art­work re­flects their love for Sin­ga­pore and is also fea­tured among the 20 designs for this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade packs.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee’s de­sign, ti­tled Colours Of My Coun­try, fea­tures the colours red, blue and green and in­cor­po­rates high-rise build­ings and trees.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah’s ac­ces­sories also bore a de­sign by Ms Ve - jaletchmy, which fea­tures four fig­ures hold­ing hands – a re­flec­tion of racial harmony, a hall­mark of Sin­ga­pore that the artist feels most strongly about.</p>
    <p>Ms Ve­jaletchmy has lived in her Ang Mo Kio flat for over 20 years, and has neigh­bours of dif­fer­ent races whom she has got to know well. “I even named the child of one of my neigh­bours Joshua,” she said, adding that the boy is now four.</p>
    <p>Both artists, who came up with their designs in a day, said that they were hon­oured to have them worn by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee added that it was a “dream come true” to know that Madam Hal­imah her­self en­dorsed art­work by peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties. “I hope it will in­spire other per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties. It has al­ways been my vi­sion for Sin­ga­pore to be a more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety,” said Ms Lee.</p>
