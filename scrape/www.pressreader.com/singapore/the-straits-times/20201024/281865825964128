    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pines will wel­come back for­eign na­tion­als from Nov 1, and let Filipino trav­ellers leave the coun­try with­out Covid-19 anti­gen tests as the South-east Asian na­tion con­tin­ues to re­open its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers with in­vest­ment visas from Philip­pine agen­cies will now be al­lowed en­try, af­ter the coun­try im­posed travel curbs in Fe­bru­ary to stem the spread of the coro­n­avirus, pres­i­den­tial spokesman Harry Roque said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of travel curbs was among a slew of re­laxed rules to help the coun­try’s bat­tered econ­omy re­cover from re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Reli­gious gath­er­ings in ar­eas un­der a looser form of quar­an­tine will be al­lowed up to 30 per cent of seat­ing ca­pac­ity from 10 per cent pre­vi­ously, Mr Roque said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment had al­ready short­ened cur­few hours in the cap­i­tal re­gion and eased stay-at-home or­ders ear­lier this week in re­sponse to a re­quest from the Cabi­net to al­low more busi­nesses to thrive.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, which has the se­cond-most num­ber of Covid-19 cases in South-east Asia af­ter In­done­sia, yes­ter­day recorded 1,923 new in­fec­tions and 132 more deaths, the largest daily in­crease in ca­su­al­ties in 15 days.</p>
    <p>To­tal con­firmed cases rose to 365,799, while deaths reached 6,915.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic con­tin­ues to af­fect the coun­try, the cap­i­tal, Manila, can­celled an an­nual pro­ces­sion of a cen­turies-old black wooden statue of Je­sus Christ that draws mil­lions of Ro­man Catholic devo­tees each year.</p>
    <p>“The grand pro­ces­sion of the life­size im­age of the Black Nazarene in Jan­uary 2021 has been can­celled due to the Covid-19 pan­demic,” the city gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Each year, mil­lions of devo­tees, mostly in yel­low and ma­roon shirts and walk­ing bare­foot, typ­i­cally jos­tle to draw near a car­riage bear­ing the life-size im­age of the Black Nazarene shoul­der­ing a heavy cross. The statue, carved in Mex­ico, is be­lieved to have mirac­u­lous heal­ing pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The pro­ces­sion, a tra­di­tion in the for­mer Span­ish colony that goes back more than two cen­turies, usu­ally lasts more than 20 hours.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of the Philip­pines’ 107 mil­lion peo­ple iden­tify as Ro­man Catholic.</p>
    <p>Manila, the coun­try’s coro­n­avirus hot spot, is un­der par­tial quar­an­tine re­stric­tions un­til the end of the month. Ceme­ter­ies and colum­baria have been or­dered to close to pre­vent crowd­ing dur­ing the All Saints’ and All Souls’ Day hol­i­days that</p>
