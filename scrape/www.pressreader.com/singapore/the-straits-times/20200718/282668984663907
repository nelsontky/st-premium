    <p>Tucked away in a quaint es­tate along Cir­cuit Road is Mr Mark Wong’s bach­e­lor pad.</p>
    <p>He bought the five-room Hous­ing Board flat in 2017 af­ter sell­ing his pre­vi­ous home – an in­dus­trial loft-style maisonette in Sin Ming that was de­signed by home-grown de­sign stu­dio Three-D Con­ceptwerke and fea­tured in Home & Decor.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing worked on Mr Wong’s maisonette eight years ago, the de­sign team is fa­mil­iar with his pref­er­ences. “This is a project where the client’s taste and per­sonal touches re­ally made a dif­fer­ence to the end re­sult,” says a spokesman for the team.</p>
    <p>While the ba­sic style can be con­sid­ered mod­ern Euro­pean, with wall bead­ings, a cof­fer-like ceil­ing and the Hamptons-style kitchen, the in­te­rior is largely in­spired by Amer­i­can in­te­rior de­signer Ju­lia Buck­ing­ham’s sig­na­ture Modernique style.</p>
    <p>De­fined as a “blend of mod­ern and vintage that boldly mixes styles, pe­ri­ods, colours, pat­terns, tex­tures and even some bling”, it is a dec­o­rat­ing ap­proach that al­lows home own­ers to cre­ate one-of-a-kind spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Buck­ing­ham, “the con­cept of Modernique is to ac­quire over time. Start with a few an­chor pieces and then you con­sider scale and how you can put them all together”.</p>
    <p>This was ex­actly what Mr Wong, who is in his 50s and works in hos­pi­tal­ity, and the de­sign team did.</p>
    <p>They be­gan by strip­ping the 1,474 sq ft apart­ment and re­con­fig­ur­ing the lay­out such that the spa­ces are as open as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The ex­ist­ing master be­d­room with an at­tached bath­room has been con­verted into a walk-in wardrobe. The room next door is now the master be­d­room, which opens out onto a semi-cir­cu­lar bal­cony that is shared with a third be­d­room.</p>
    <p>The doors are usu­ally left open. Mr Wong says: “I want the spa­ces to flow through­out the en­tire apart­ment. There is no need to close up the rooms be­cause it is just me and my cats, Fred­die and Sofia.”</p>
    <p>To the left of the main en­trance is the open-con­cept kitchen that was de­signed around the Smeg hob and oven. The red Smeg re­frig­er­a­tor and other Smeg ap­pli­ances add a pop of colour against the grey cab­i­nets and white Dek­ton coun­ter­tops too.</p>
    <p>Since mov­ing in just be­fore Chi­nese New Year in 2018, Mr Wong has al­ready made changes to the in­te­rior, some­thing he is used to do­ing in the homes he has lived in.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal sofa and arm­chairs in the liv­ing room have been re­placed with a pair of chaise longues that can be placed sep­a­rately or re­ar­ranged to form a large daybed.</p>
    <p>The lat­est revamp also saw the in­cor­po­ra­tion of me­tal­lic el­e­ments, such as or­na­men­ta­tion sal­vaged from a Queens­lan­der home, which Mr Wong spray-painted sil­ver.</p>
    <p>He also added hand-painted wall­pa­per from Bri­tain within the ex­ist­ing wall bead­ings. Together, they form an in­ter­est­ing frame and back­drop for some of his art col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>The choice of fur­ni­ture and fur­nish­ings in the apart­ment re­flects his pen­chant for sal­vaging one-off pieces that peo­ple cast off as junk. He says: “I like the idea of reusing old stuff and in­cor­po­rat­ing some new el­e­ments to cre­ate in­ter­est­ing de­tails.”</p>
    <p>The master bath­room has been ex­tended to cre­ate a larger shower area.</p>
    <p>While the con­trolled pal­ette of greys, whites and black is con­sis­tent with the rest of the in­te­rior, the neon pink and glit­tery sil­ver of an art­work de­pict­ing New York City’s Times Square on the wall adds a pop of colour.</p>
    <p>The ren­o­va­tion, which took around four months, set Mr Wong back by about $150,000, ex­clud­ing fur­ni­ture and fur­nish­ings.</p>
    <p>For the de­sign team, this project was about cre­at­ing a ver­sa­tile in­te­rior that the home owner can add his own per­sonal touches to over time. “It re­flects the bond be­tween the client and his home,” says the spokesman.</p>
