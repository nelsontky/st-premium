    <p>Play­ers and match of­fi­cials in Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) clubs will take swab tests for the coro­n­avirus by the end of this week. The Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore in­formed club of­fi­cials of the re­quire­ment yesterday as it seeks to re­sume Sin­ga­pore’s only pro­fes­sional sports league on Oct 10.</p>
    <p>Play­ers and match of­fi­cials in the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) clubs will un­dergo swab test­ing for Covid-19 by the end of this week, as the league looks to­wards an Oct 10 re­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>The Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) in­formed club of­fi­cials of this re­quire­ment in a Zoom meet­ing yesterday.</p>
    <p>The SPL, Sin­ga­pore’s only pro­fes­sional sports league, has been sus­pended since March 24 ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>FAS gen­eral sec­re­tary Yazeen Buhari told The Straits Times: “The SPL re­sump­tion is de­pen­dent on clear­ance by the rel­e­vant govern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>“The clubs have been train­ing in full since Sept 1 and an all-clear from the swab tests will be a big step to­wards a restart. The play­ers and of­fi­cials will be at the fore­front of the foot­ball ac­tion and thus we are pri­ori­tis­ing them for this ini­tial test­ing.”</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert Leong Hoe Nam said that it is the right time to con­sider a re­sump­tion of the SPL, not­ing that Sin­ga­pore has “done well” in its man­age­ment of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, with few com­mu­nity cases re­cently.</p>
    <p>He said test­ing play­ers once be­fore ev­ery game would be ideal, with fort­nightly tests also work­able.</p>
    <p>“The swab­bing is a form of as­sur­ance to the public and play­ers that care and pru­dence have been ex­er­cised,” Dr Leong said.</p>
    <p>Most lead­ing over­seas leagues such as the English Premier League (EPL) and Span­ish La Liga, among oth­ers, con­duct reg­u­lar test­ing for Covid-19 among play­ers and of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Just on Mon­day, the EPL an­nounced that 10 peo­ple had tested pos­i­tive for the dis­ease and would need to self-iso­late for 10 days.</p>
    <p>Last week, West Ham man­ager David Moyes and two of his play­ers also tested pos­i­tive – they were asymp­to­matic. In to­tal, 20 peo­ple have been di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus since the new sea­son be­gan on Sept 12.</p>
    <p>ST re­ported last Satur­day that the SPL could re­turn on Oct 10, should the multi-min­istry task force give the go-ahead, and FAS pres­i­dent Lim Kia Tong had noted there were “some healthy signs” that raised the pos­si­bil­ity for a “re­sump­tion in</p>
    <p>THE RIGHT WAY</p>
    <p>the first part of Oc­to­ber”.</p>
    <p>Games will be played with­out fans and pre­cau­tions in place will be sim­i­lar to when the SPL moved to closed-door matches shortly be­fore its sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>There will also likely be changes to the for­mat of do­mes­tic league and Cup com­pe­ti­tions, with a view to re­duc­ing the to­tal num­ber of games played. Orig­i­nally, each side in the nine-team league were sched­uled to play one another thrice.</p>
    <p>There are still ques­tion marks over the par­tic­i­pa­tion of de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Brunei DPMM, with the team’s head coach Adrian Pen­nock telling ST last week the sit­u­a­tion was “out of their hands” as they have yet to re­sume full train­ing.</p>
    <p>The SPL fra­ter­nity wel­comed the news of the im­mi­nent re­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Tampines Rovers chair­man Des­mond Ong said: “Clearly we are happy at the news of a pro­posed re­sump­tion but we re­main cau­tious and guided by the task force as to how to go about mat­ters.</p>
    <p>“We mustn’t let any­thing put to waste all the hard work put in by all our healthcare work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Cheng Tim Nee, gen­eral man­ager of Balestier Khalsa, said that swab test­ing is a “pos­i­tive step” to­wards a restart, adding: “We hope all will go smoothly and we can re­sume league ac­tion un­der safe con­di­tions for every­one in­volved.”</p>
    <p>For Hougang United mid­fielder Fabian Kwok, the league’s re­turn can­not come soon enough. “After train­ing for months over Zoom dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, then two months of train­ing in groups of five, and now al­most a month of nor­mal train­ing, it’s start­ing to get a bit mun­dane,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, we look for­ward to com­pe­ti­tion again… and since the end of the cir­cuit breaker we have heard so many ru­mours of when the league might restart. We are tired of them (the ru­mours) al­ready.”</p>
    <p>Another player, who asked not to be named, said he was thrilled by the news as the play­ers had felt as if they were train­ing hard “with­out a real di­rec­tion”.</p>
    <p>“I also ap­plaud the move for test­ing, be­cause this is a move that will keep all play­ers and of­fi­cials even safer,” he added.</p>
    <p>The swab­bing is a form of as­sur­ance to the public and play­ers that care and pru­dence have been ex­er­cised.</p>
