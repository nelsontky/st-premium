    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion (EC) warned yes­ter­day that Euro­pean Union gov­ern­ments were un­pre­pared for the new surge of Covid-19 in­fec­tions and rec­om­mended com­mon mea­sures to roll out vac­cines should they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>“While the evo­lu­tion of the pan­demic is get­ting back to March lev­els, our state of pre­pared­ness is not,” said the EU ex­ec­u­tive branch’s vice-pres­i­dent Mar­gari­tis Schi­nas.</p>
    <p>He urged EU states to adopt a com­mon strat­egy for the new phase of the pan­demic and avoid the “ca­coph­ony” of dif­fer­ent na­tional mea­sures that char­ac­terised the first months of the pan­demic on the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>With new cases hit­ting about 100,000 daily, Europe has by a wide mar­gin over­taken the United States, where more than 51,000 Covid-19 in­fec­tions are re­ported on av­er­age ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>As tri­als of Covid-19 vac­cines ad­vance, with the first shots po­ten­tially avail­able by the end of the year ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, Brussels is urg­ing EU gov­ern­ments to pre­pare vac­ci­na­tion plans.</p>
    <p>Health pol­icy is a na­tional pre­rog­a­tive in the 27-coun­try bloc and the EC can make only rec­om­men­da­tions for com­mon mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Hospi­tals and vac­ci­na­tion ser­vices should be prop­erly staffed with skilled work­ers equipped with nec­es­sary pro­tec­tive gear, the com­mis­sion said, urg­ing gov­ern­ments to avoid the short­ages that dogged the bloc when the epi­demic flared up in March.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines should be made avail­able first to the most vul­ner­a­ble groups, which in­clude health­care and long-term care fa­cil­ity work­ers, peo­ple aged over 60, peo­ple with chronic dis­eases, es­sen­tial work­ers, and more dis­ad­van­taged so­cio-eco­nomic groups.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a con­ser­va­tive es­ti­mate, made by the com­mis­sion in July, peo­ple be­long­ing to “pri­or­ity groups” could be more than 200 mil­lion of the EU pop­u­la­tion of 450 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The EC also called on EU gov­ern­ments to pre­pare for the pos­si­ble dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines that may need to be stored at ex­tremely low tem­per­a­tures.</p>
