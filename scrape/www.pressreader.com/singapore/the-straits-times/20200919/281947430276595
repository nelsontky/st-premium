    <p>We think of Covid-19 as killing pri­mar­ily the el­derly around the world, but in poor coun­tries it is more cat­a­clysmic than that. It is killing chil­dren through mal­nu­tri­tion. It is lead­ing more peo­ple to die from tu­ber­cu­lo­sis, malaria and Aids. It is forc­ing girls out of school and into child mar­riages. It is caus­ing women to die in child­birth.</p>
    <p>It is set­ting back ef­forts to erad­i­cate po­lio, fight malaria and re­duce fe­male gen­i­tal mu­ti­la­tion. It is lead­ing to lapses in vi­ta­min A dis­tri­bu­tion that will cause more chil­dren to suf­fer blind­ness and die.</p>
    <p>The UN Pop­u­la­tion Fund warns that Covid-19 may lead to an ad­di­tional 13 mil­lion child mar­riages around the world and to some 47 mil­lion women be­ing un­able to get ac­cess to mod­ern con­tra­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>In short, a pan­demic of disease, il­lit­er­acy and ex­treme poverty is fol­low­ing on the heels of this coro­n­avirus pan­demic – and it is hit­ting chil­dren the hard­est.</p>
    <p>The great­est im­pact of the coro­n­avirus may be not on those whom the virus di­rectly in­fects, but on those shat­tered by the col­lapse of economies and health and ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Many schools and clin­ics are closed, medicines for Aids and other ail­ments are some­times un­avail­able, and cam­paigns against malaria and gen­i­tal mu­ti­la­tion are of­ten sus­pended.</p>
    <p>“The in­di­rect im­pact of Covid-19 in the global south will be even greater than the di­rect im­pact,” Dr</p>
    <p>Muham­mad Musa, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of Brac In­ter­na­tional, an out­stand­ing Bangladesh-based non-profit, told me. “The di­rect im­pact, as tragic as it is, af­fects those in­fected and their fam­i­lies. The in­di­rect im­pact has eco­nomic and so­cial con­se­quences for vastly more peo­ple – with jobs lost, fam­i­lies hun­gry, do­mes­tic vi­o­lence up, more chil­dren leav­ing school, and costs over gen­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>In this sense, many of those whom Covid-19 kills never ac­tu­ally get the disease. In­stead, they are chil­dren who die of measles be­cause they couldn’t get vac­ci­nated in a time of plague – up to 80 mil­lion chil­dren may miss vac­ci­na­tions. Or they die of mal­nu­tri­tion be­cause their fa­thers lost jobs as rick­shaw driv­ers or their moth­ers couldn’t sell veg­eta­bles in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>As is of­ten the case in eco­nomic crises, the bur­den falls par­tic­u­larly on girls. More are be­ing mar­ried off as chil­dren so that the new hus­band’s fam­ily will feed them, or they are sent off to the city to work as maids in ex­change for food and neg­li­gi­ble in­comes – while fac­ing an end to ed­u­ca­tion and sig­nif­i­cant risk of abuse.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor chal­lenge be­ing faced by stu­dents is hunger,” said Ms An­ge­line Murim­irwa, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor for Africa at Camfed</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional, which sup­ports girls’ ed­u­ca­tion in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>More than 60 per cent of Camfed’s stu­dents in Malawi re­port suf­fer­ing a lack of food. Be­fore this cri­sis, 4 per cent of girls in Zim­babwe mar­ried by 14. That fig­ure may now worsen.</p>
    <p>Years ago, I heard of a wrench­ing query from a bright and am­bi­tious Kenyan girl: Should she drop out of school and give up her dreams, or should she ac­cept a sex­ual re­la­tion­ship with a man who would then pay for her ed­u­ca­tion – but who she feared had HIV? More girls will now face such im­pos­si­ble choices.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis is driven by lock­downs and eco­nomic col­lapse, cou­pled with plum­met­ing re­mit­tances from over­seas. Brac found that more than two-thirds of the peo­ple it works with in Liberia, Nepal, the Philip­pines and Sierra Leone said that in­comes had been greatly re­duced or had dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>“If you’re a day labourer and you’re told you can’t leave your shack one day, the next day you’ve got no in­come to buy food,” noted Mr Mark Low­cock, the United Na­tions’ hu­man­i­tar­ian chief. “I would bet my house that there’s go­ing to be an in­crease in poverty head count, an in­crease in child mor­tal­ity, an in­crease in ma­ter­nal mor­tal­ity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bill Gates and oth­ers are call­ing on Congress to in­clude US$4 bil­lion (S$5.4 bil­lion) in the next Amer­i­can stim­u­lus pack­age to help en­sure that ev­ery­one world­wide can get vac­ci­nated for the coro­n­avirus. Don’t think of that as char­ity, but as an in­vest­ment in global health se­cu­rity – and we also need emer­gency in­vest­ments for ed­u­ca­tion, po­lio and nutri­tion.</p>
    <p>But, so far, rich coun­tries have mostly been self-ab­sorbed and small-minded, not con­sid­er­ing that a dis­tant out­break can again cross their own bor­ders. A UN ap­peal for US$10 bil­lion for Covid-19 re­sponse has raised only about a quar­ter of that.</p>
    <p>One of hu­man­ity’s tri­umphs in mod­ern times has been a his­toric trend since about 1990 in which ex­treme poverty (de­fined as some­one liv­ing on less than US$2 a day, ad­justed for in­fla­tion) has tum­bled by about two-thirds. Trag­i­cally, that is now re­versed.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple world­wide in ex­treme poverty has risen by 37 mil­lion since Covid-19 hit, and it will rise an­other 25 mil­lion next year, es­ti­mates by the In­sti­tute of Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion show.</p>
    <p>At the turn of each year re­cently, I’ve writ­ten a col­umn ar­gu­ing that the pre­vi­ous year was the best in hu­man his­tory, based on such met­rics as the risk that a child will die or re­main il­lit­er­ate. I won’t be able to write such a col­umn this win­ter, or per­haps for years to come.</p>
    <p>Asked if Covid-19 is a set­back for that era of progress, or a book­end, Mr Low­cock said: “At a min­i­mum this is go­ing to be a sig­nif­i­cant blip. If we’re not care­ful, it’ll be worse than a blip. It could knock back for decades some of the progress that has been made.”</p>
    <p>IM­MENSE IN­DI­RECT IM­PACT</p>
    <p>The di­rect im­pact (of Covid-19), as tragic as it is, af­fects those in­fected and their fam­i­lies. The in­di­rect im­pact has eco­nomic and so­cial con­se­quences for vastly more peo­ple – with jobs lost, fam­i­lies hun­gry, do­mes­tic vi­o­lence up, more chil­dren leav­ing school, and costs over gen­er­a­tions.</p>
