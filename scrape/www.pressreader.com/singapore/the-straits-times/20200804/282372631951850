    <p>GENEVA • Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino will “re­spect any de­ci­sion by the ethics com­mit­tee”, world foot­ball’s gov­ern­ing body said yes­ter­day, af­ter the Swiss au­thor­i­ties opened crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings against him last week.</p>
    <p>“I’ve no doubt that Gianni In­fantino would re­spect any de­ci­sion by the ethics com­mis­sion,” deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Alas­dair Bell told a video news con­fer­ence. “We don’t see any ev­i­dence of crim­i­nal or un­eth­i­cal be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>Fifa had in­sisted a day ear­lier that In­fantino will con­tinue in his post, as it blasted the launch of the probe against him. “There was and is ab­so­lutely no rea­son to open any in­ves­ti­ga­tion be­cause noth­ing re­motely crim­i­nal has hap­pened and there is noth­ing at all to sug­gest any form of crim­i­nal wrong­do­ing,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Last week, for­mer Fifa pres­i­dent Sepp Blat­ter called for his suc­ces­sor to be sus­pended by Fifa af­ter spe­cial prose­cu­tor Stefan Keller started pro­ceed­ings on Thurs­day as part of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into sus­pected col­lu­sion be­tween In­fantino and Switzer­land’s At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Michael Lauber, the coun­try’s top prose­cu­tor.</p>
    <p>Lauber, who of­fered his res­ig­na­tion on July 24, was in charge of Switzer­land’s probe into the tow­er­ing cor­rup­tion scan­dal that exploded at the heart of Fifa in 2015.</p>
    <p>But he was forced to re­cuse him­self from the in­ves­ti­ga­tion in June last year, fol­low­ing me­dia reve­la­tions that he had held sev­eral un­de­clared meet­ings with In­fantino dur­ing the probe.</p>
    <p>Swiss au­thor­i­ties said Keller “reached the con­clu­sion that... there are in­di­ca­tions of crim­i­nal con­duct” in re­la­tion to meet­ings be­tween In­fantino, Lauber and an­other of­fi­cial, Ri­naldo Arnold, in 2016 and 2017.</p>
    <p>Fifa hit back on Sun­day, ac­cus­ing Keller of hav­ing brought for­ward no le­gal grounds for his probe.</p>
    <p>“Keller has pre­sented no se­ri­ous el­e­ments or le­gal ba­sis for the open­ing of any in­ves­ti­ga­tion and lacks any de­tail as to the sub­stance of the case,” it said. Fifa also said it was “not il­le­gal any­where in the world” to meet a prose­cu­tor.</p>
    <p>It said the meet­ing be­tween In­fantino and Lauber was “en­tirely log­i­cal” given that the Of­fice of the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral was con­duct­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions in more than 20 cases in Fifa-re­lated mat­ters.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion said such meet­ings or con­tacts were “rou­tine” dur­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>It said the point of the meet­ing was to of­fer Fifa’s “full sup­port” for the in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and In­fantino at­tended in “good faith”.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land has pur­sued a num­ber of cases since a raid on a lux­ury ho­tel in Zurich in May 2015 led to the ar­rests of a sev­eral Fifa ex­ec­u­tives and ex­posed an al­legedly cor­rupt un­der­belly in world foot­ball.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, more than 20 Fifa pro­ceed­ings have been opened in Switzer­land over the past five years into al­le­ga­tions of cor­rup­tion and vote-buy­ing, and al­le­ga­tions over the award­ing of tele­vi­sion rights con­tracts.</p>
