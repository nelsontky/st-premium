    <p>NEW YORK • Be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break, tick­ets to join the stu­dio au­di­ence of Satur­day Night Live (SNL) were a pre­cious com­mod­ity – of­fered free by NBC but so hard to ob­tain that some com­edy fans were will­ing to pay for them.</p>
    <p>But now, the tick­ets to this lon­grun­ning sketch show – still free and still scarce – come with a bonus: Mem­bers of its stu­dio au­di­ence have been paid to at­tend.</p>
    <p>The pay­ments are the re­sult of new guide­lines im­ple­mented by the state of New York, which has been reg­u­lat­ing the re­open­ing of busi­nesses and industries dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day night, the state’s health de­part­ment con­firmed that SNL had fol­lowed its re­open­ing guide­lines by “cast­ing” mem­bers of the live au­di­ence for its sea­son pre­miere on Satur­day – the show’s first live episode since March 7 – and pay­ing them for their time.</p>
    <p>It is not clear how many au­di­ence mem­bers were paid guests.</p>
    <p>Mr Sean Lud­wig, who at­tended the SNL sea­son pre­miere over the week­end, said he and seven friends each re­ceived a cheque for US$150 (S$204) from Uni­ver­sal Tele­vi­sion, a di­vi­sion of NBC’s par­ent com­pany, when the show was over.</p>
    <p>“We had no idea we would be paid be­fore we were handed cheques,” he said. “We were all very pleas­antly sur­prised.”</p>
    <p>The free­lance writer, who runs a bar­be­cue web­site and news­let­ter, said he and his friends had ob­tained the tick­ets through a web­site called 1iota that screens au­di­ences for talk shows and other events.</p>
    <p>He said they had been given a rapid virus test and asked to sign health forms in­di­cat­ing that they did not have Covid-19 or its symp­toms and had not come into con­tact with any­one who had it be­fore they were al­lowed to at­tend the show.</p>
    <p>In the days lead­ing up to the SNL sea­son pre­miere, it was un­clear whether the show would be able to draw its stu­dio au­di­ence from the gen­eral pub­lic, as it has done in past years, be­cause of state re­stric­tions around re­open­ing dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier state­ment, the state’s health de­part­ment said tick­eted events had been pro­hib­ited since March 16 and that the re­stric­tion had not changed.</p>
    <p>But SNL had al­ready been ask­ing live au­di­ence mem­bers to reg­is­ter through its 1iota page, which has since been taken down.</p>
    <p>The show had asked ap­pli­cants to re­quest be­tween seven and nine tick­ets for peo­ple whom they con­sid­ered to be part of their “so­cial bub­ble” and had out­lined the coro­n­avirus-re­lated pre­cau­tions that the show would be tak­ing.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dent of 1iota Pro­duc­tions, Mr Ben Bis­cotti, de­clined to com­ment on the com­pany’s role re­gard­ing the show’s live au­di­ence and did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a ques­tion about why the SNL page was taken down.</p>
    <p>Based on the guide­lines around pan­demic-era me­dia pro­duc­tion that were re­leased by the state, tele­vi­sion shows are not al­lowed to host live au­di­ences un­less they con­sist of paid em­ploy­ees, cast and crew.</p>
    <p>And if the show de­cides to cre­ate an au­di­ence out of its work­ers, the au­di­ence can be only 25 per cent of its typ­i­cal size, and can be no more than 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>That left SNL an op­tion that would al­low it to in­clude mem­bers of the pub­lic in its live au­di­ences while keep­ing i n line with the state’s rules: Pay those au­di­ence mem­bers like em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Mr Jonah Bruno, a spokesman for the state health de­part­ment, said in a state­ment on Mon­day night that SNL had con­firmed to them that it had fol­lowed the state’s re­open­ing guide­lines by se­lect­ing au­di­ence mem­bers through a third-party screen­ing and cast­ing process and by com­pen­sat­ing them for their time.</p>
    <p>Last month, NBC an­nounced that SNL would re­turn to its tra­di­tional live for­mat, start­ing with its Oct 3 sea­son pre­miere, which was hosted by Chris Rock.</p>
    <p>A por­tion of the tick­ets to the show was re­served for health­care work­ers, who re­ceived a hu­mor­ous shout-out at the start of the show.</p>
    <p>In his open­ing mono­logue, Rock ad­dressed the front sec­tion of au­di­ence mem­bers, whom he iden­ti­fied as first re­spon­ders, and joked: “They’re so good, we let peo­ple die tonight so they could see a good show.”</p>
    <p>The show is ex­pected to air at least four more live episodes through the end of the month.</p>
