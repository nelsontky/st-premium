    <p>Ac­claimed com­edy writer-di­rec­tor Armando Ian­nucci boldly reimag­ines Charles Dick­ens’ most fa­mous char­ac­ter in the film The Per­sonal His­tory Of David Cop­per­field – most no­tably by cast­ing Bri­tish-In­dian ac­tor Dev Pa­tel as the iconic hero, a poor or­phan who per­se­veres to be­come a writer in Vic­to­rian Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a screen­ing of the movie in Toronto, Canada, Pa­tel – star of the Os­car-win­ning drama Slum­dog Mil­lion­aire (2008) – says he hopes the movie of­fers a new gen­er­a­tion the chance to dis­cover the au­thor’s clas­sic tale of grit and “find a face they can re­late to” in its multi-eth­nic cast.</p>
    <p>Ian­nucci, the Scot­tish cre­ator of the satir­i­cal po­lit­i­cal come­dies Veep (2012 to 2019) and The Thick Of It (2005 to 2012), says his take on the story is “all about com­mu­nity and com­pas­sion”.</p>
    <p>When he reread Dick­ens’ 1850 novel David Cop­per­field about eight years ago, the 56-year-old re­mem­bers be­ing struck “by how mod­ern it was in terms of its themes of friend­ship, love, so­cial anx­i­ety, riches and poverty”.</p>
    <p>“And it in­stantly opened it­self up to me as a film be­cause Dick­ens writes in a very cine­matic way – he was a very ex­per­i­men­tal writer.”</p>
    <p>But the film-maker in­sists that movie­go­ers do not need to know any­thing about the book or have stud­ied it in school to ap­pre­ci­ate the film, which opens in Sin­ga­pore to­day and also stars Hugh Lau­rie, Tilda Swin­ton and Benedict Wong.</p>
    <p>Nor do au­di­ences need to ap­proach it as a dry pe­riod drama.</p>
    <p>“The themes in it are so fresh and con­tem­po­rary and rel­e­vant to­day,” Ian­nucci says. “It’s set in 1840, but for the peo­ple i n it, that’s the present day and that’s how we’ve shot it. It’s an ex­cit­ing world and can hope­fully reach out to have con­tem­po­rary con­nec­tions with to­day.”</p>
    <p>Si­mon Black­well, who co-wrote the screen­play with Ian­nucci, says this is also a more comedic take than other adap­ta­tions of the book.</p>
    <p>“It’s one of the fun­ni­est books I’ve ever read but it’s also very long, just over 600 pages – so when you have to fit it into a film or se­ries, the ten­dency is to take out the com­edy be­cause it doesn’t carry the story.”</p>
    <p>Black­well, 54, adds: “You never think, ‘Oh, I can see why that would have been funny in 1850.’ It just is. And we both wanted to fo­cus on that.”</p>
    <p>Pa­tel, 30, was con­vinced to take the role be­cause of how exquisitel­y funny it was.</p>
    <p>But he sheep­ishly ad­mits he had not been fa­mil­iar with Dick­ens’ novel before be­ing of­fered the part and had thought the ti­tle re­ferred to the Amer­i­can il­lu­sion­ist.</p>
    <p>“I went to the meet­ing very ex­cited to saw some peo­ple in half,” he quips. “Then Armando sat down and laid out this in­cred­i­ble story. I hadn’t read the script, but I was so enamoured with how he ex­tracted com­edy from ev­ery small mo­ment that I wanted to work with this man.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor’s wish is for the movie to in­tro­duce the story to more peo­ple and to “avoid an­other dopey guy like me not know­ing who David Cop­per­field is”.</p>
    <p>“And hope­fully a new gen­er­a­tion will be able to look at this film and find a face they can re­late to.”</p>
    <p>While most Dick­ens adap­ta­tions fea­ture all-white casts, Ian­nucci de­cided early on that the cast­ing would be colour-blind, with Pa­tel as the lead and Wong – a Bri­tishChi­nese ac­tor – as the lawyer Mr Wick­field.</p>
    <p>“I wanted as var­ied a cast as pos­si­ble,” says the di­rec­tor, also re­veal­ing that his heart had been set on Pa­tel as the lead from the start.</p>
    <p>“Dev was the only per­son I could think of and he was the first per­son I spoke to about it. I’m so re­lieved he said yes be­cause I had no one else on the list,” he says of the star, who was nom­i­nated for an Os­car for the drama Lion (2016).</p>
    <p>“I in­stantly saw it as (Pa­tel) and (he’s) in ev­ery scene apart from 15 min­utes.”</p>
    <p>Pa­tel says he was “blown away with the de­tail of the writ­ing” as well as the cal­i­bre of the large cast, which also in­cludes Peter Ca­paldi, Ben Whishaw and Gwen­do­line Christie – an en­sem­ble the ac­tor de­scribes as “the Avengers of Bri­tish ac­tors”.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor adds: “I’m a ner­vous lit­tle bean, but all of these guys were great and ev­ery­one got stuck in it to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The Per­sonal His­tory Of David Cop­per­field opens to­day.</p>
