    <p>For years, in­vestors hap­pily bought into the dol­lar bonds of Chi­nese real es­tate de­vel­op­ers, bet­ting that the big­gest and most ag­gres­sive would be­come too big to fail. Even dur­ing the global mar­ket sell-off in March, pri­vate bankers told their wealthy clients not to worry. In the worst case, they could just hold those notes un­til ma­tu­rity and en­joy the juicy coupon pay­ments.</p>
    <p>China Ever­grande Group’s re­cent tum­ble is a wake-up call. Bei­jing’s lat­est pol­icy shifts show it is con­fi­dent that killing a dragon or two won’t cause a wild­fire.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande, one of the coun­try’s largest de­vel­op­ers with 2.3 tril­lion yuan (S$463 bil­lion) in as­sets, faced a cri­sis of con­fi­dence late last week. A dra­matic sell-off in its stocks and bonds fol­lowed re­ports that the com­pany had sent a let­ter to the Guang­dong gov­ern­ment warn­ing of a po­ten­tial cash crunch if it couldn’t carry out a back­door list­ing in Shen­zhen by next Jan­uary. The com­pany said in a fil­ing that the doc­u­ment was “fab­ri­cated”.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, in­vestors were un­nerved. The doc­u­ment, fake or not, struck the right note. Just over a month ago, Bei­jing pro­posed a “three red lines” ap­proach for ma­jor de­vel­op­ers. Those ex­ceed­ing all three lever­age met­rics mon­i­tored by reg­u­la­tors are for­bid­den from bor­row­ing more. Ever­grande has solidly crossed that thresh­old.</p>
    <p>In that “fab­ri­cated” doc­u­ment seen by Bloomberg Opin­ion, Ever­grande threat­ened sys­temic risk (835.5 bil­lion yuan in bor­row­ings), bank­rupt­cies of its busi­ness part­ners and job losses. These are among the rea­sons why it must go public.</p>
    <p>But there is no sys­temic risk. Rather than crack­ing down on the en­tire in­dus­try, the new “three red lines” pol­icy is very tar­geted.</p>
    <p>Out of the 334 de­vel­op­ers likely sub­ject to the new rules, only 50 of them, ac­count­ing for 36 per cent of to­tal in­dus­try bor­row­ing, failed all three cri­te­ria, ac­cord­ing to Gavekal Drago­nomics. Mean­while, de­vel­op­ers ac­count­ing for just un­der half of to­tal debt passed all three tests. Sim­i­larly, of the 18 largest de­vel­op­ers tracked by Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence, 11 are in the green zone and can raise their bor­row­ings by 10 to 15 per cent each year.</p>
    <p>In other words, even if Ever­grande fell on hard times, other big de­vel­op­ers could just come in and carve off its as­sets. In fact, this is what China Vanke is do­ing with Ta­hoe Group, the first large de­vel­oper to de­fault on a bond in five years. De­vel­op­ers have a lot of hard as­sets. Land banks can be sold, se­nior lenders will get paid, and the rest will have to soak up losses. They don’t need to be bailed out by the state.</p>
    <p>Amid China’s delever­ag­ing cam­paign two years ago, Vanke said its goal for the next three years would be sim­ply “to sur­vive”. That star­tling slo­gan turned out to be pre­scient and was fol­lowed by a broader bond sell-off in the sec­tor. Last week­end, its chair­man Yu Liang came out talk­ing again.</p>
    <p>In his view, China’s real es­tate mar­ket can be di­vided into three stages. In the 1990s, those with the right po­lit­i­cal con­nec­tions were able to get land cheaply. The auc­tion sys­tem im­ple­mented in 2002 up­ended that. Since then, those with the ap­petite and ac­cess to bank loans and shadow fi­nanc­ing were the win­ners. Start­ing next year, only good gov­er­nance will mat­ter, Mr Yu said.</p>
    <p>Heed his words. Over the years, Ever­grande has seemed like a cat with nine lives, liv­ing dan­ger­ously with a whop­ping 47 per cent of its bor­row­ings due within a year. Per­haps its good for­tune is com­ing to an end.</p>
