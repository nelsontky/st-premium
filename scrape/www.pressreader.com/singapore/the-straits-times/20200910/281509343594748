    <p>It wasn’t un­til she was 12 that Ms Grace Lee dis­cov­ered she was adopted.</p>
    <p>But there were signs – peo­ple of­ten com­mented that she looked dif­fer­ent from her par­ents and brother, and she had mem­o­ries of liv­ing in a room full of rowdy chil­dren be­fore her par­ents turned up and whisked her away.</p>
    <p>When she was in Pri­mary 6, her sus­pi­cions were con­firmed: She was not her par­ents’ bi­o­log­i­cal child.</p>
    <p>Her adop­tive par­ents, a teacher and an avi­a­tion man­ager, had been called to her school one day over some com­pli­ca­tions with her vac­ci­na­tion in­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, now 35, found out that her blood type was B+ while both her adop­tive par­ents had blood type O.</p>
    <p>“That mo­ment was very ter­ri­fy­ing,” she said, adding that, even at 12, she knew what it meant. Two par­ents with blood type O can­not pro­duce a child with blood type B.</p>
    <p>“I was very ashamed... things got very bad from that point on­wards,” she said.</p>
    <p>She kept her dis­tress to her­self, but could not come to terms with the fact that she had been aban­doned at birth in the hos­pi­tal by her bi­o­log­i­cal mother and was adopted from a chil­dren’s home at the age of five.</p>
    <p>It showed when she be­gan act­ing out in school, putting lit­tle to no ef­fort into her stud­ies, hang­ing out with the wrong crowd and play­ing tru­ant.</p>
    <p>“I would pur­posely do things that dis­ap­pointed my par­ents and broke their hearts: steal­ing, ly­ing, ev­ery­thing that you can think of,” she said.</p>
    <p>She even re­fused to bathe and would wear the same uni­form for days on end till it was grubby and stinky.</p>
    <p>“If I re­fused, it didn’t mat­ter what my par­ents did as they could not force me. I was very stub­born,” said Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents, who had a son af­ter adopt­ing Ms Lee, did their best to help her, send­ing her for coun­selling and giv­ing in to her when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“I think it was quite ter­ri­fy­ing for them be­cause they thought that they had given me hope by adopt­ing me. I thought so too, but it was just not easy to adapt,” said Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing they did less­ened her pain, she added.</p>
    <p>She still had feel­ings of aban­don­ment. Her birth par­ents had not wanted her and her adop­tive par­ents did not seem open to talk­ing about the adop­tion.</p>
    <p>So for years, she strug­gled with her lone­li­ness un­til she met a kin­dred spirit with a sim­i­larly painful past when she was a stu­dent at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE).</p>
    <p>The school had brought in a mo­ti­va­tional speaker, a sin­gle mother, to speak to the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee was struck by how their sto­ries mir­rored each other’s, as the speaker had aban­doned one of her own chil­dren. “It felt like... she was the mother and I was the child that had been aban­doned, so I felt that I could con­nect with her,” she said.</p>
    <p>The speaker told the au­di­ence that “only you have the power to be happy”. “You don’t have to de­pend on other peo­ple for your hap­pi­ness,” added Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>That struck a chord with her and she ap­proached the wo­man, who told her to “push her bound­aries” every day, in a pos­i­tive way.</p>
    <p>And that she did.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee started by putting in more ef­fort into school, work­ing harder at her stud­ies and mak­ing bet­ter friends.</p>
    <p>She also tried to spend more time with her par­ents at home and asked them for feed­back on her school­work, some­thing she had never done be­fore.</p>
    <p>To her sur­prise, she aced her sub­jects and went from be­ing at the bottom of her class to plac­ing in the top three by the end of her first year at ITE.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one around me was very sur­prised,” she said, adding that she told no one of her goals as she had wanted to let her re­sults speak for them­selves.</p>
    <p>To prove it was not a fluke, she stud­ied hard for the next few years and made it to Te­masek Polytech­nic’s busi­ness di­ploma course. She also got an of­fer to read busi­ness eco­nomics at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity af­ter polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>But she turned this down i n favour of work­ing over­seas in the hos­pi­tal­ity in­dus­try. Later, she grad­u­ated from a Swiss hos­pi­tal­ity in­sti­tute with first-class hon­ours.</p>
    <p>“I worked very hard to get back on track be­cause I re­alised how much time I had wasted,” she said.</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ued in the same in­dus­try for close to 13 years, ris­ing to the po­si­tion of de­part­ment head at a ho­tel.</p>
    <p>But she quit her job last year, af­ter a chance en­counter with a guest at the ho­tel where she worked.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee had felt an in­stant con­nec­tion with the guest, who had been in the same in­dus­try and looked very sim­i­lar to her. While the two turned out to be of no re­la­tion, Ms Lee shared her life story and men­tioned she had some doubts about con­tin­u­ing in her line of work.</p>
    <p>The guest en­cour­aged her to step out of her com­fort zone and Ms Lee de­cided to ex­plore a sec­ond ca­reer – one that would al­low her to use her nat­u­ral tal­ent at pub­lic speak­ing and work with at-risk kids.</p>
    <p>“I was also think­ing that God has brought me so far, he gave me a sec­ond chance at life... so let me just leave these things to God and see what hap­pens,” she said.</p>
    <p>She is now a reg­is­tered life coach, and uses her past ex­pe­ri­ences to help chil­dren and youth chart their life plans and goals.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee still lives with her adop­tive mother and brother, who is now 31. Her par­ents are di­vorced.</p>
    <p>Her mother, 70, who de­clined to be named, said she was happy Ms Lee had found some­thing she loves do­ing.</p>
    <p>She added: “She had some old wounds that re­quired some deeper heal­ing and emo­tional sup­port, but it has been won­der­ful and re­ward­ing to see her grow and take charge of her life.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lee said she has put her past be­hind her. In her late teens, she had at­tempted to search for her bi­o­log­i­cal mother, but stopped search­ing when the trail went cold. There is no record of her bi­o­log­i­cal fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to go down this path again be­cause the more I thought about it, the more up­set I be­came, and I didn’t want to go back to where I was af­ter hav­ing changed so many things,” she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are still mo­ments when a sense of lone­li­ness makes her stop to catch her breath.</p>
    <p>“I’m some­one with­out any rel­a­tives in this world. That thought alone can be very de­press­ing.”</p>
    <p>But then she turns her thoughts to­wards a dif­fer­ent di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Till this day, I’m very grate­ful that peo­ple around me show care and con­cern, and they don’t look at me any dif­fer­ently,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee said her adop­tive par­ents never gave up on her.</p>
    <p>“They hung on to the hope that things would change for me and they never stopped loving me.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s re­ally beau­ti­ful that in the end, the things that hurt me the most, are the things that now help me help oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>ON THE BRIGHT SIDE</p>
    <p>I think it’s re­ally beau­ti­ful that in the end, the things that hurt me the most, are the things that now help me help oth­ers.</p>
