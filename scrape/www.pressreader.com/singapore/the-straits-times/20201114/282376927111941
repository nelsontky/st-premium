    <p>A youth who wanted to make the for­mer boyfriend of an un­der­age girl jeal­ous had sex with her twice in one even­ing in pub­lic places.</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to two counts of sex­u­ally pen­e­trat­ing the girl, who was 15 years old at the time.</p>
    <p>She can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>The of­fender also can­not be named due to amend­ments to the Chil­dren and Young Per­sons Act, which now cov­ers those be­low 18 years old.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Kor Zhen Hong said the two teenagers met near Kal­lang Com­mu­nity Club in Boon Keng Road some time be­fore 8pm on Feb 13.</p>
    <p>The youth, who knew the girl had a for­mer boyfriend and wanted to make him jeal­ous, then asked her to ac­com­pany him to some shops in the neigh­bour­hood. The girl agreed.</p>
    <p>The pair later went to the com­mu­nity club, where the girl told the of­fender that she wanted to use the toi­let.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that she go to the male toi­let in­stead as there was a bidet spray in there.</p>
    <p>The girl agreed and they en­tered the same cu­bi­cle, where they had sex­ual in­ter­course.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “Af­ter a few min­utes, the ac­cused and the vic­tim heard the sound of shut­ters rolling. Think­ing that the com­mu­nity club was about to be closed for the day, the ac­cused and vic­tim both got dressed and left the male toi­let.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused asked the vic­tim if she wanted to con­tinue hav­ing sex with him. The vic­tim agreed.”</p>
    <p>The pair then went to a nearby block of flats and con­tin­ued hav­ing sex at a stair­case land­ing. They parted ways soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>The boy’s of­fences came to light the next day when the girl told her school’s dis­ci­pline mas­ter about them.</p>
    <p>She was later taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal, which found that she did not have any sex­u­ally trans­mit­ted in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the court called for re­ports to as­sess the of­fender’s suit­abil­ity for pro­ba­tion and re­for­ma­tive train­ing.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers sen­tenced to re­for­ma­tive train­ing will be de­tained at a centre and made to fol­low a strict reg­i­men that in­cludes foot drills as well as coun­selling.</p>
    <p>The youth will be sen­tenced on Nov 20.</p>
