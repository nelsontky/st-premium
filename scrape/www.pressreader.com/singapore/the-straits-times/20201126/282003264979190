    <p>Across the United States, vast “freezer farms” are pop­ping up – ware­houses con­tain­ing row af­ter row of ul­tra-cold stor­age equip­ment de­signed to house a vac­cine against Covid-19 when one is ap­proved.</p>
    <p>These ware­houses are the most vis­i­ble sign of a new sup­ply chain set up in just a few months as public of­fi­cials and pri­vate com­pa­nies pre­pare for the im­mi­nent ar­rival of one or more po­ten­tially world-chang­ing drugs, at least one of which will have to be stored at tem­per­a­tures colder than an Arc­tic win­ter.</p>
    <p>The smooth func­tion­ing of this cold sup­ply chain is vi­tal if the US is to be able to of­fer vac­cines to ev­ery­one who wants one, as the fed­eral gov­ern­ment has promised by next sum­mer.</p>
    <p>For US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe</p>
    <p>Bi­den, the vac­cine plan is ar­guably the most im­por­tant is­sue that awaits him. His rep­u­ta­tion as pres­i­dent will prob­a­bly be de­cided in large part by whether he can pro­vide vac­cines to enough peo­ple to help end the pan­demic in a coun­try that has recorded more than 12.2 mil­lion cases and nearly 257,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>“This is the most dif­fi­cult dis­tri­bu­tion chal­lenge we have ever faced,” says Mr Dusty Ten­ney, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Stir­ling Ul­tra­cold, which makes some of the very cold freez­ers needed to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vac­cine at tem­per­a­tures of mi­nus 70 deg C. “It is like do­ing Ama­zon’s one- or two-day de­liv­ery, but us­ing ul­tra-low tem­per­a­ture prod­ucts that have never be­fore made it on to the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Dis­tribut­ing a coro­n­avirus vac­cine will be a daunt­ing task for ev­ery gov­ern­ment around the world, es­pe­cially for de­vel­op­ing na­tions where it is of­ten far harder to guar­an­tee that doses will re­main at the kind of low tem­per­a­tures re­quired for the likely two first vac­cines. Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca’s vac­cine, which has re­ceived Oper­a­tion Warp Speed fund­ing, can be stored at nor­mal fridge tem­per­a­tures, how­ever.</p>
    <p>In the US, the task will be made harder not just by the coun­try’s rugged and of­ten sparsely pop­u­lated ter­rain. Other chal­lenges in­clude a hos­tile po­lit­i­cal back­drop where out­go­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has spent the past three weeks con­test­ing the elec­tion re­sults, agree­ing only on Mon­day night to start al­low­ing con­tact be­tween ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials and Mr Bi­den’s transition team.</p>
    <p>If it goes wrong, the vac­cine roll-out could re­sem­ble the de­ba­cle that char­ac­terised the US re­sponse to the early stages of the virus, when tests mal­func­tioned and states bid against one an­other in the scram­ble to pro­cure per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) for health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>It could also sow the seeds of the next great Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal di­vide. Al­ready Democrats are ac­cus­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of fail­ing to do enough to pri­ori­tise vac­ci­nat­ing mi­nor­ity groups, while ru­ral vot­ers who pre­dom­i­nantly sup­port Mr Trump are also wor­ried they will miss out.</p>
    <p>But if it goes smoothly, al­lies of Mr Trump hope it could help res­cue his rep­u­ta­tion for han­dling the pan­demic. And it is even more likely to de­ter­mine the for­tunes of Mr Bi­den, whose first term will be dom­i­nated by the virus and its af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>Columbia Univer­sity vi­rol­o­gist An­gela Ras­mussen says: “The</p>
    <p>Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion has largely got a han­dle on the ap­proval process; the big worry now for Joe Bi­den is: How does he dis­trib­ute a vac­cine, how does he do so eq­ui­tably, and how does he per­suade peo­ple to get it?”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den him­self en­cap­su­lated his task last week, warn­ing: “How do we get over 300 mil­lion Amer­i­cans vac­ci­nated? What’s the game plan? It’s a huge, huge, huge un­der­tak­ing.”</p>
    <p>FIGHT FOR SUP­PLIES</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of work, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion pub­lished its dis­tri­bu­tion plans last month. Of­fi­cials say they will be able to pro­vide vac­cines for all vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple – likely to be front-line health­care work­ers and older peo­ple with un­der­ly­ing ill­nesses – by the end of the year; all older peo­ple by the end of Jan­uary; and ev­ery­one by early sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Un­der those plans, Oper­a­tion Warp Speed – the vac­cine de­vel­op­ment project the Pres­i­dent set up in May – will use a piece of soft­ware cre­ated by tech­nol­ogy com­pany Palan­tir to track sup­ply and de­mand in real time. The app, known as Tiberius, prom­ises to give fed­eral of­fi­cials ac­cess to lo­calised data on ev­ery­thing from the lo­ca­tion of doses of the vac­cines to how many peo­ple live in care homes in a given area.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion is pay­ing health­care lo­gis­tics com­pany McKes­son to over­see the de­liv­ery of many of the vac­cines, although not the Pfizer one which the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany it­self is re­spon­si­ble for – al­beit with gov­ern­ment money and as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, hun­dreds of com­pa­nies – from haulage firms to freezer providers to pro­duc­ers of ship­ping con­tain­ers – are bid­ding for a patch­work of lo­cal and fed­eral con­tracts to help de­liver doses. Not only does the vac­cine need to ar­rive in the right place and in the right con­di­tion, but so do mil­lions of nee­dles, glass stor­age vials and PPE for those ad­min­is­ter­ing it.</p>
    <p>Mr Francesco In­calza, pres­i­dent for Europe, the Middle East and Africa for re­frig­er­ated trans­port com­pany Thermo King, says of the global dis­tri­bu­tion task: “If the early vac­cines are two doses each, we are talking about trans­port­ing five bil­lion of them in the first year – that would need 8,000 Boe­ing 777 flights.”</p>
    <p>Trump of­fi­cials say the plans, which have been jointly drawn up by the health depart­ment and the Pen­tagon, in­volve mil­i­tary-level pre­ci­sion. “The lo­gis­tics are be­ing worked to the minute, in an army-com­bat ap­proach,” says Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, head of Oper­a­tion Warp Speed. “We have table­top ex­er­cises – which are kind of re­hearsals – ev­ery Fri­day, in which we iden­tify ar­eas that need more spe­cific so­lu­tions. I feel very com­fort­able that it is in­cred­i­bly well worked out.”</p>
    <p>But Dr Slaoui’s task is to get the vac­cine to state-des­ig­nated dis­tri­bu­tion hubs: It is up to the states them­selves to get them to in­di­vid­u­als, through a net­work of hos­pi­tals, com­mu­nity cen­tres and high street phar­ma­cies.</p>
    <p>This is what Bi­den ad­vis­ers say wor­ries them most: that a lack of di­rec­tion from the fed­eral gov­ern­ment risks re­peat­ing the sit­u­a­tion in spring, when states tried to buy the same items of PPE with lit­tle guid­ance from the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, leav­ing gaps in cer­tain ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Al­ready there are signs that this is hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>North Dakota is one of a hand­ful of states that have been run­ning pi­lot schemes for how vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion would work, even car­ry­ing out dummy runs us­ing doses of flu vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The state, which has been hit harder than al­most any­where in the world by the virus, has bought four ul­tra-cold freez­ers to store the Pfizer vac­cine, ig­nor­ing the ad­vice of the Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion. North Dakota has also bought its own dry ice ma­chine to equip ship­ping con­tain­ers in which it will trans­port doses even to its most ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>But as a vac­cine ap­proval has got closer, sup­plies have been get­ting harder to come by. “Lo­cal providers are hav­ing prob­lems get­ting nee­dles and vials be­cause the fed­eral gov­ern­ment is buy­ing them all up,” says the state’s im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­gramme man­ager Molly Howell. “There is also def­i­nitely a short­age of gloves and N95 masks.”</p>
    <p>Dry ice is an­other con­cern. Ear­lier this year, there were na­tional short­ages of the prod­uct, which is a by-prod­uct of petrol man­u­fac­tur­ing, as lock­downs brought ci­ties to a halt and crushed de­mand for petrol. The US Com­pressed Gas As­so­ci­a­tion in­sists there will be enough to get through the win­ter, but an­other round of lock­downs could yet put that in peril.</p>
    <p>FAIR DIS­TRI­BU­TION</p>
    <p>An­other con­cern of the in­com­ing Bi­den team is that mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties, many of which have been hit hard­est by the disease, will not be pri­ori­tised. Though a gov­ern­ment-com­mis­sioned re­port has rec­om­mended mak­ing sure black peo­ple in par­tic­u­lar get the vac­cine early, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is leav­ing it up to states to de­cide ex­actly how they will al­lo­cate their doses.</p>
    <p>In a year that has seen mass up­ris­ings against po­lice vi­o­lence to­wards black peo­ple, many fear any ap­proach that would fur­ther en­trench Amer­ica’s po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural divi­sions.</p>
    <p>New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo warned this month: “(The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is) ba­si­cally go­ing to have the pri­vate providers do it and that’s go­ing to leave out all sorts of com­mu­ni­ties that were left out the first time when Covid-19 rav­aged them.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Trump threat­ened not to dis­trib­ute the vac­cine to Mr Cuomo’s state at all.</p>
    <p>Dr He­lene Gayle, who co-au­thored a gov­ern­ment-com­mis­sioned re­port on how to dis­trib­ute a coro­n­avirus vac­cine fairly, is one of a num­ber of ex­perts whom Mr Bi­den’s transition team has con­sulted in re­cent weeks. She says: “The plan­ning is just get­ting started, and there hasn’t been the na­tional lead­er­ship this re­quires. States have been left to them­selves.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has promised to spend US$25 bil­lion (S$33.6 bil­lion) on vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion, hop­ing to plug the gaps they say have been left by the Trump plan. But prop­erly iden­ti­fy­ing those gaps has been made harder by the fact that the Pres­i­dent-elect’s ad­vis­ers have been de­nied ac­cess to ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials for weeks af­ter the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The de­lay had prompted warn­ings from se­nior of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Dr Slaoui, who said ear­lier this month: “It is a mat­ter of life and death for thou­sands of peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>ANTI-VAXXER RE­SIS­TANCE</p>
    <p>Even if all that works – if the vac­cine is trans­ported safely and in suf­fi­cient num­bers from fac­to­ries to dis­tri­bu­tion hubs, lo­cal clin­ics and phar­ma­cies – whether peo­ple will agree to have the jab is an­other ques­tion.</p>
    <p>An hour out­side Bismarck, the cap­i­tal of North Dakota, where Ms Howell has been toil­ing away on her state’s dis­tri­bu­tion plans, Ms Alexis Wan­gler has been watch­ing the race to get a drug ap­proved with grow­ing con­cern. She lives in Lin­ton, a small town with about 1,000 res­i­dents. Like most of the state, it has been rav­aged by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ms Wan­gler’s hus­band be­lieves he had the virus, hav­ing suf­fered fa­tigue and a loss of smell and taste. His grand­mother def­i­nitely did, and ended up in hos­pi­tal with the disease. Her co-worker’s hus­band is still in hos­pi­tal – though he is now out of in­ten­sive care and no longer re­ceiv­ing sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen. Nearly one in 10 North Dakotans has now tested pos­i­tive for the disease since the start of the pan­demic, and 14 per cent of those cur­rently be­ing tested are com­ing back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, none of this is enough to per­suade Ms Wan­gler to line up for a shot. “Vac­cine mak­ers have said they are in a race to pro­duce it, so that means corners will most likely be cut,” she says. “I’m go­ing to take my chances with my God-given im­mune sys­tem, which has a way bet­ter chance of pro­tect­ing me.”</p>
    <p>Ms Wan­gler is not alone – only 42 per cent of Amer­i­cans cur­rently plan to take a coro­n­avirus vac­cine, ac­cord­ing to YouGov, thanks to wide­spread safety con­cerns. Some of those are com­mit­ted anti-vaxxers, many more are sim­ply wor­ried that this ap­proval process has been rushed. That is far be­low the 70 per cent of peo­ple who ex­perts think need to be vac­ci­nated be­fore enough of the pop­u­la­tion is re­sis­tant to bring the spread of the virus to a stand­still.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den wants to achieve herd im­mu­nity through a vac­cine, he will have to per­suade peo­ple like Ms Wan­gler. The prob­lem is she, like most of her neigh­bours, did not vote for him, and does not trust him on health­care is­sues – es­pe­cially af­ter he and his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris warned about vac­cine safety con­cerns dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing one of the states that has suf­fered most from the pan­demic, with more than 72,000 cases, North Dakota’s votes for Mr Trump in­creased at the last elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Nor is the state a one-off. An anal­y­sis by broad­caster NPR last week found that Mr Trump in­creased his share of the vote in 68 out of the 100 coun­ties with the high­est Covid-19 death rates per capita – a trend seen across states that voted both Repub­li­can and Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>These are the vot­ers who feel they have been left be­hind by the po­lit­i­cal class in Wash­ing­ton, and ex­perts warn their alien­ation with main­stream pol­i­tics is only likely to grow if they feel they are be­ing by­passed while the rest of the coun­try plots an exit from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A CLEAR DEPAR­TURE</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s al­lies prom­ise he will be the coun­try’s “healer-in-chief”, bring­ing the coun­try to­gether af­ter a di­vi­sive four years un­der Mr Trump. But the phrase could also be used lit­er­ally.</p>
    <p>If Mr Bi­den wants to be re­mem­bered for more than beat­ing Mr Trump, he will have to man­age one of the big­gest, most com­plex and most po­lit­i­cally charged health­care projects ever un­der­taken by the US gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“The only com­par­a­tive thing the health­care sys­tem does right now is roll out a na­tional flu vac­cine ev­ery year,” says Dr Eric Topol, a car­di­ol­o­gist and pro­fes­sor at the Scripps Re­search In­sti­tute, a med­i­cal think-tank. “But that is not com­pul­sory, it is not as dif­fi­cult to han­dle and is nowhere near as im­por­tant as a coro­n­avirus vac­cine will be.”</p>
    <p>Those who have helped shape Mr Bi­den’s dis­tri­bu­tion plans in­sist the Pres­i­dent-elect will be up to the task.</p>
    <p>“The fact is that you have a Pres­i­dent-elect who has made con­trol­ling the pan­demic one of his four pri­or­i­ties – that in it­self is very dif­fer­ent from what we have at the mo­ment,” says Dr Gayle. “Ev­ery­thing is a clear depar­ture from the pre­vi­ous ap­proach.”</p>
