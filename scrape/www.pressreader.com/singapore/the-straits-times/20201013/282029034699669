    <p>The largest con­tainer ship in the world pow­ered by liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG) docked in Sin­ga­pore on Sun­day be­fore load­ing up and head­ing on­wards to Europe the next day.</p>
    <p>At 400m long, the CMA CGM Jac­ques Saade, be­long­ing to French ship­ping and lo­gis­tics firm CMA CGM, is longer than four foot­ball fields, and is 78m tall and 61m wide.</p>
    <p>Its voyage takes place de­spite chal­lenges and dis­rup­tions caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic, and em­bod­ies the re­silience of the mar­itime in­dus­try and its ef­forts to ad­dress cli­mate change, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Not only is ship­ping keep­ing global sup­ply chains open and goods flow­ing, new ships that also ad­dress other crit­i­cal chal­lenges are be­ing put into op­er­a­tion,” said Mr Chee, who viewed the ship at Pasir Pan­jang Ter­mi­nal.</p>
    <p>He noted that the use of LNG can con­trib­ute to­wards meet­ing the In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s goal of re­duc­ing green­house gas emis­sions from global ship­ping by 2050 and phas­ing them out within this cen­tury.</p>
    <p>“The path­ways to achiev­ing these goals will re­quire strong co­op­er­a­tion among stake­hold­ers, as well as sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ments. It can­not be achieved by any sin­gle party work­ing alone, but re­quires a col­lec­tive ef­fort by all stake­hold­ers work­ing to­gether,” he said.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Chee also reaf­firmed Sin­ga­pore’s com­mit­ment, as a ma­jor trans­ship­ment port and bunker­ing hub, to sup­port­ing global ef­forts to fight cli­mate change, such as in find­ing “in­no­va­tive ways to pro­vide for the future green fuel needs of the ship­ping in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>The CMA CGM Jac­ques Saade mega ship has a ca­pac­ity of 23,000 20-foot equiv­a­lent units (TEUs) and is op­er­ated by a 26-man crew, along with a gas man­age­ment of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The ship was con­structed af­ter seven years of re­search and de­vel­op­ment, and har­nesses dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy such as aug­mented re­al­ity screens on the bridge of the ship to en­hance sit­u­a­tional aware­ness.</p>
    <p>The ves­sel started its maiden voyage from China on Sept 23, and passed through var­i­ous ports be­fore reach­ing Sin­ga­pore on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day it de­parted for North</p>
    <p>Europe and the Mediter­ranean, with con­tain­ers of house­hold goods, elec­tron­ics, ma­chin­ery and per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>The ves­sel will have called at 13 ports in to­tal over 84 days, in­clud­ing Bu­san in South Korea, Shang­hai in China, Klang in Malaysia, Rot­ter­dam in the Nether­lands, Dunkirk in France and Southamp­ton in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephane Courquin, head of CMA CGM in Asia and Ocea­nia, said LNG is the most ad­vanced so­lu­tion when it comes to pre­serv­ing air qual­ity to­day, and called it a “crit­i­cal part of our en­ergy tran­si­tion strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with traditiona­l marine fuel oil, LNG re­duces sul­phur and fine par­ti­cles emis­sion by 99 per cent, ni­tro­gen diox­ide emis­sions by 85 per cent and car­bon diox­ide emis­sions by up to 20 per cent, he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Mr Courquin also an­nounced that in the com­ing months, CMA CGM will have eight other sim­i­larly large ships join­ing its fleet. By 2022, it will have 20 LNG-pow­ered ves­sels.</p>
    <p>“As we move ahead with LNG, we are hope­ful that there will be a wider adop­tion of LNG in the in­dus­try. This also means that the global LNG in­fra­struc­ture must ma­ture with sup­ply sources in more parts of the world, so that it will be op­er­a­tionally vi­able for car­ri­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been de­vel­op­ing the in­fra­struc­ture to sup­port the use of LNG, and the Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore has is­sued two LNG bunker sup­plier li­cences, with more to come in the weeks ahead.</p>
