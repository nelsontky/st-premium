    <p>LON­DON • Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has said that his Manch­ester United side are “get­ting closer” to the stan­dards de­manded at Old Traf­ford as they fo­cus on reach­ing the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>United con­ceded a stop­page­time goal against Southamp­ton on Mon­day to draw 2-2, end­ing a run of four straight Pre­mier League wins but they are still un­beaten in 18 games in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­sult left the Red Devils in fifth place in the ta­ble on 59 points – four be­hind third-placed Chelsea who have played a game more – but they are as­sured of a top-four fin­ish if they win their re­main­ing games against Crys­tal Palace, West Ham and fel­low Cham­pi­ons League hope­fuls Le­ices­ter.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer said his mes­sage to his play­ers ahead of to­day’s trip to Sel­hurst Park was to keep on do­ing what they had been do­ing and “trust your­selves”.</p>
    <p>“You’re at a club where it al­ways boils down to the last cou­ple of weeks, or two or three games in the sea­son any­way,” he said at his pre­match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ve done fan­tas­tic since we restarted. We started with the draw against Tot­ten­ham of course but then had a great run. That lit­tle bit of a set­back is a test for men­tal­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Asked if this was the best United team since for­mer man­ager Alex</p>
    <p>Fer­gu­son’s league ti­tle win­ners in 2013, Sol­sk­jaer said: “I don’t think that’s my job to say... but of course we’ve played some good foot­ball, some en­joy­able foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“Now it is about con­sis­tency. We know we’re priv­i­leged to play for this great club and there’s a cer­tain ex­pec­ta­tion on how we should play foot­ball and we’re get­ting closer and closer to that type of team.”</p>
    <p>The United boss also said he will not rest key play­ers for Sun­day’s FA Cup semi-fi­nal against Chelsea, with his fo­cus solely on their clash against Palace.</p>
    <p>“The team se­lec­tion for Thurs­day is based on Thurs­day, not Sun­day. Sun­day is ir­rel­e­vant, it does not come into my head at all,” he said.</p>
    <p>United could be short on de­fen­sive op­tions, with left-backs Luke Shaw and Bran­don Wil­liams rac­ing against time to be fit.</p>
    <p>Shaw twisted his an­kle against for­mer em­ploy­ers Southamp­ton, while his re­place­ment Wil­liams suf­fered a head in­jury af­ter col­lid­ing with Kyle Walker-Peters.</p>
    <p>“Luke has got a swollen an­kle, I’ll give him as much time as pos­si­ble to re­cover, it was a twisted an­kle.</p>
    <p>“Bran­don cut up his eye. I don’t re­ally know, nei­ther of them trained yes­ter­day,” Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
    <p>For­ward An­thony Mar­tial is in the midst of a pur­ple patch, scor­ing five goals in six league games since the sea­son’s restart and Sol­sk­jaer was de­lighted with the French­man’s de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“He’s def­i­nitely im­prov­ing and en­joy­ing his foot­ball, he’s stepped it up this sea­son as an in­di­vid­ual and more as a team player, and phys­i­cally,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber there were talks about our for­wards last sea­son be­ing the least ac­tive and there were stats fly­ing around but An­thony is work­ing re­ally hard for the team and he is a qual­ity fin­isher.”</p>
    <p>Crys­tal Palace are on a five-game los­ing streak, hav­ing scored just two goals and con­ceded 13.</p>
    <p>Jef­frey Schlupp, James Tomkins and Gary Cahill are out in­jured, while Chris­tian Ben­teke is sus­pended fol­low­ing his red card in the 2-0 loss to As­ton Villa on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>SQUEAKY BUM TIME</p>
    <p>You’re at a club where it al­ways boils down to the last cou­ple of weeks, or two or three games in the sea­son any­way.</p>
