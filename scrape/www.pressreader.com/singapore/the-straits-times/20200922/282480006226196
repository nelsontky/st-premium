    <p>While most guests par­tic­i­pated in the cer­e­mony over the In­ter­net, some stars still man­aged to share the stage in per­son with host Jimmy Kim­mel.</p>
    <p>Jen­nifer Anis­ton was the evening’s open­ing presenter. She and Kim­mel (both right) sani­tised a re­sults envelope be­fore set­ting it on fire in a trash can, in a funny bit in­tended to demon­strate the show’s high hy­giene stan­dards.</p>
    <p>But the trash can con­tin­ued to burn af­ter they thought they had put the fire out.</p>
    <p>A vis­i­bly shocked Anis­ton swiftly picked up the fire ex­tin­guisher and quickly put out the flames. And she did it all in heels and a vin­tage black Dior dress. Amer­i­can singer H.E.R. (right) per­formed a pas­sion­ate ren­di­tion of Prince’s Noth­ing Com­pares 2 U for the In Me­mo­riam seg­ment of the show, hon­our­ing the stars and peo­ple be­hind the scenes who died this year.</p>
    <p>Kim­mel opened the seg­ment with a tribute to the United States Supreme Court Jus­tice and fem­i­nist icon Ruth Bader Gins­burg, who died last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>With no au­di­ence in sight, the 23-year-old’s song struck a sombre chord, pay­ing tribute to stars such as Regis Philbin, Naya Rivera, Diana Rigg and Chad­wick Bose­man.</p>
    <p>A video of Bose­man speak­ing, lay­ered over the myth­i­cal plains of Wakanda – the fic­tional African na­tion fea­tured in the ac­tor’s most sig­nif­i­cant work, Black Pan­ther (2018) – was shown. He died last month at the age of 43 of colon can­cer.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>FRIENDS RE­UNION</p>
    <p>Anis­ton may not have picked up tro­phies for her per­for­mance in The Morn­ing Show, but at least she had her Friends with her.</p>
    <p>The star re­turned home af­ter pre­sent­ing the first award of the night and later showed up on video with Lisa Kudrow and Courteney Cox, her co-stars in the iconic com­edy Friends (1994 to 2004).</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Ja­son Bate­man showed up in the back­ground as well. This was prob­a­bly the most light-hearted mo­ment of the show.</p>
    <p>4 WHEN YOU LOSE THE EMMY...</p>
    <p>The most viral mo­ment of the night hap­pened off-screen.</p>
    <p>Ramy Youssef – cre­ator and star of the se­ries Ramy – lost for both di­rect­ing and lead ac­tor to com­edy Schitt’s Creek.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old then up­loaded a short video of a presenter in a haz­mat suit-and-tuxedo out­fit wav­ing good­bye to him and leav­ing with an Emmy tro­phy, cap­tion­ing it: “When you lose the Emmy.”</p>
    <p>The clip had more than 90,000 likes in four hours.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>PO­LIT­I­CAL AWAK­EN­ING</p>
    <p>With the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion loom­ing, many stars made known their po­lit­i­cal be­liefs with words and choice of cloth­ing.</p>
    <p>African-Amer­i­can stars such as Regina King and Uzo Aduba, who both picked up act­ing wins, wore T-shirts bear­ing po­lice shoot­ing vic­tim Bre­onna Tay­lor’s name and image.</p>
    <p>Out­stand­ing Drama Se­ries Suc­ces­sion’s cre­ator Jesse Arm­strong de­liv­ered a se­ries of “un-thank-yous” to world lead­ers such as US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son for their in­ept han­dling of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Mark Ruf­falo, who won for his per­for­mance in the lim­ited se­ries I Know This Much Is True, em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of vot­ing in the up­com­ing elec­tion.</p>
