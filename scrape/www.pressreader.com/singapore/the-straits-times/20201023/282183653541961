    <p>• Rip­ple Labs has short­listed Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore as coun­tries the blockchain pay­ment ser­vices com­pany could move to if it leaves the US ow­ing to a lack of reg­u­la­tory clar­ity, its top ex­ec­u­tive said.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land, Bri­tain and the United Arab Emi­rates are also po­ten­tial des­ti­na­tions, chief ex­ec­u­tive Brad Gar­ling­house said in an interview. “The com­mon de­nom­i­na­tor be­tween all of them is that their gov­ern­ments have cre­ated a clar­ity about how they would reg­u­late dif­fer­ent dig­i­tal as­sets, dif­fer­ent cryp­tocur­ren­cies,” he said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in a sep­a­rate interview with Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion, Mr Gar­ling­house said the US au­thor­i­ties are un­clear on the sta­tus of cryp­tocur­ren­cies, with dif­fer­ent opin­ions on whether they are a com­mod­ity, a cur­rency, a prop­erty or a se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>“Reg­u­la­tion shouldn’t be a guess­ing game,” he said. “Rip­ple is def­i­nitely a proud US com­pany and we’d like to stay in the US if that was pos­si­ble. But we also need reg­u­la­tory clar­ity in or­der for us to in­vest and grow the busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has been a con­trast to the United States, cre­at­ing an “en­vi­ron­ment for a very healthy mar­ket to de­velop”, he said. The coun­try in­tro­duced a reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem for cryp­tocur­rency ex­change op­er­a­tors in 2017 – a move widely seen as an of­fi­cial ac­knowl­edge­ment of dig­i­tal coins as a fi­nan­cial as­set.</p>
    <p>Mr Gar­ling­house high­lighted Rip­ple’s ties with Ja­panese fi­nan­cial con­glom­er­ate SBI Hold­ings, in­clud­ing their Tokyo-based joint ven­ture of­fer­ing global pay­ment ser­vices driven by blockchain tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>SBI chief ex­ec­u­tive Yoshi­taka Ki­tao, known for his push to cre­ate a hub for in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial busi­ness in western Ja­pan, joined Rip­ple’s board last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Gar­ling­house said: “Ja­pan is one of our fastest-grow­ing mar­kets, in part be­cause we have key part­ners like SBI.” He added: “I have spo­ken to the SBI team about the fact we are look­ing at (the coun­try as a po­ten­tial des­ti­na­tion).”</p>
    <p>Mr Gar­ling­house said the pan­demic has given a “tail­wind” to cryp­tocur­rency mar­kets be­cause cen­tral banks have been print­ing fiat cur­rency, which is “in­fla­tion­ary on some level”. A move away from cash is also help­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>Rip­ple, a San Fran­cisco-based com­pany, of­fers pay­ments and set­tle­ment ser­vices through the vir­tual cur­rency known as XRP and other plat­forms.</p>
