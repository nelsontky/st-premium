    <p>NEW YORK • Poor LeBron James. There he is again, bat­tling into the deep muck of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-offs, lead­ing his team oh-so-close to a ti­tle. And there he is: An om­nipresent force in pur­ple-striped high-tops, so con­sis­tently great on the big­gest stage that we have come to ex­pect noth­ing less.</p>
    <p>His Los An­ge­les Lak­ers are now vy­ing with the Den­ver Nuggets for a spot in the NBA Fi­nals. Af­ter Sun­day’s 105-103 vic­tory over the Nuggets – sealed by An­thony Davis with a buzzer-beater but fu­elled by James’ hot start – Los An­ge­les are up 2-0 in the best-of-seven series.</p>
    <p>Should the Lak­ers ad­vance, it would mean that James has pushed teams from three cities – Cleve­land, Mi­ami and Los An­ge­les – to the league’s cham­pi­onship round in nine of the past 10 sea­sons.</p>
    <p>Within that time, he won two ti­tle rings with the Mi­ami Heat, and one with the Cleve­land Cava­liers and in the clois­ter of the Dis­ney World “bub­ble”, he is mak­ing a cred­i­ble run for an­other cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The bur­den of great ex­pec­ta­tions is not new. As a high school ju­nior, he was cast as a bas­ket­ball mes­siah. Which ath­lete has ever de­liv­ered so thor­oughly on such early hype?</p>
    <p>And which ath­lete presents more of a modern-day para­dox? He is among the most suc­cess­ful sports stars in his­tory, on his way to bil­lion­aire sta­tus, in­flu­en­tial, ad­mired and con­nected to at least 120 mil­lion fol­low­ers on so­cial me­dia. De­spite all of this, there are far too many who take him for granted.</p>
    <p>Just last week, the NBA un­veiled the win­ner of its Most Valu­able Player Award for this pan­demi­claced sea­son. Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo of the Mil­wau­kee Bucks was no doubt wor­thy of the award. But James was, too.</p>
    <p>He bounced back from a rare, injury-plagued sea­son to help re­turn the Lak­ers to dom­i­nance. He did it while his team mourned the death of leg­end Kobe Bryant in a he­li­copter crash in Jan­uary. He did it when the league re­turned to play amid a world torn by a pan­demic. He did it at age 35.</p>
    <p>So how is it that he lost the MVP vote in a land­slide? James flashed a cut­ting bit­ter­ness when asked about the award.</p>
    <p>“Out of 101 votes, I got 16 first­place votes,” he said, an­gry at the ab­sur­dity of not even com­ing close.</p>
    <p>James knows his worth to the league and the way his pres­ence has long al­tered the land­scape.</p>
    <p>But there are many rea­sons he is taken for granted. Silly ar­gu­ments over who is bet­ter, him or Michael Jor­dan, dis­tract from the abil­ity to see him for what he re­ally is.</p>
    <p>Race is part of the mix. There are still too many who can­not see be­yond James’ phys­i­cal­ity, his un­com­mon blend of size and strength and speed. Still too many who see him with­out nu­ance, first and fore­most as a body. A black body.</p>
    <p>That al­lows the easy dis­missal of the ded­i­ca­tion he has al­ways put into stay­ing in shape – and the dis­re­gard of his sheer in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>To watch him is to watch an ath­lete at­tuned to the flow, feel and prob­a­bil­ity of ev­ery move and ev­ery mo­ment. The blocks, dunks, spin­ning pirou­ettes and sprint­ing fast breaks. The tips, screens, fall­aways and sud­den passes that cut across the court as if rock­et­ing along on a zip line.</p>
    <p>He has been do­ing this for 17 years. Con­sider the span of that jour­ney. Think of 2010. That’s the year of “The De­ci­sion”, James’ na­tion­ally tele­vised an­nounce­ment that he was leav­ing Cleve­land for a Mi­ami team stocked with All-Stars.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber how he was scorned and vil­i­fied? How a sin­gle line from that pro­nounce­ment – “tak­ing my tal­ents to South Beach” – be­came a punch­line, code for nar­cis­sism and dis­loy­alty?</p>
    <p>But James was ac­tu­ally com­ing into his own. He was tap­ping into a long­ing that is at once universal and felt at a par­tic­u­lar, bone-deep level in black Amer­ica: The long­ing to break bonds, the urge for free­dom of move­ment, the need for self-de­ter­mi­na­tion and con­trol.</p>
    <p>The re­ver­ber­at­ing power of that de­ci­sion gets lost in the haze of me­mory. How easy it is to for­get the ways in which James changed the par­a­digm. His shift to Mi­ami was the dawn of an era dur­ing which he be­came a lead­ing voice for black Amer­i­can em­pow­er­ment.</p>
    <p>He may be fine with­out the ex­tra adu­la­tion. But in a year full of de­spair, we would be wise to take stock of all that he is – all of his pow­er­ful, steady bril­liance – and stop tak­ing him for granted.</p>
