    <p>Sin­ga­pore liver sur­geon Tan Kai Chah starts work at his new clinic on the is­land of Hainan on Dec 1. It will be the first Sin­ga­pore-op­er­ated med­i­cal cen­tre on the is­land in south­ern China.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects to be work­ing there for at least the next three months be­cause of the cur­rent dif­fi­cul­ties in trav­el­ling as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But even­tu­ally, he and other Sin­ga­pore doc­tors work­ing at the Asia Ad­vance Multi-Spe­cialty Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Hainan ex­pect to see pa­tients there a few days each month.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan de­scribed the tim­ing of the new cen­tre as per­fect be­cause for­eign pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore have dwin­dled to a trickle ow­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Un­der a pi­lot scheme, China al­lows for­eign doc­tors to prac­tise in Hainan with­out su­per­vi­sion, and for for­eign­ers to have ma­jor­ity own­er­ship of health­care in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2013, the Hainan Boao Lecheng In­ter­na­tional Med­i­cal Tourism Pi­lot Zone makes it easy to im­port drugs and in­stru­ments ap­proved for use in the United States, the Euro­pean Union, Is­rael and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>China hopes that by bring­ing in for­eign drugs and equip­ment as well as doc­tors to com­ple­ment lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als, it could en­cour­age some of the 600,000 peo­ple who leave the coun­try ev­ery year for med­i­cal treat­ment else­where to turn to Hainan.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who is ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of the Asian Amer­i­can Med­i­cal Group (AAMG), de­cided to set up the cen­tre in 2018 be­cause he felt that med­i­cal tourism in Sin­ga­pore was “fac­ing a lot of head­wind”, mainly due to high costs.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of re­stric­tions in Hainan made it at­trac­tive, given the huge China mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Gu Gang, direc­tor of the Lecheng In­ter­na­tional Med­i­cal Tourism Pi­lot Zone Ad­min­is­tra­tion Bureau, told the Chi­nese me­dia in Jan­uary: “We can give three-year work per­mits to in­ter­na­tional doc­tors in Lecheng for the first time.”</p>
    <p>In July, he an­nounced that a new drug ap­proved for use in the United States was al­ready al­lowed into the zone. Fur­ther­more, pa­tients from other parts of China were, for the first time, al­lowed to take such new drugs from Hainan back home with them.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan noted that it could take years to get such drugs ap­proved in other parts of China. For­eign own­er­ship of clin­ics and hos­pi­tals else­where in the coun­try is limited to 30 per cent, but is 70 per cent in the pi­lot zone and, upon re­quest, pos­si­bly up to 100 per cent.</p>
    <p>AAMG is rent­ing more than 3,500 sq m in the Boao In­ter­na­tional Hospi­tal for its 100 per cent-owned med­i­cal cen­tre. So far, only about half the space has been ren­o­vated for use.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre not only pro­vides treat­ment for liver prob­lems, but will also of­fer aes­thetic treat­ments helmed by doc­tors from Dream Plastic Surgery, which is one of the largest in the field in</p>
    <p>South Korea.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan has also signed a let­ter of in­tent with London’s King’s Col­lege Hospi­tal, to col­lab­o­rate and es­tab­lish a liver cen­tre in Hainan to of­fer screen­ing and treat­ment for liver, pan­cre­atic, bil­iary tract and gall blad­der dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>He hopes to ex­pand the scope of the cen­tre by next year, with the help of other Sin­ga­pore doc­tors, to in­clude car­dio and or­thopaedic ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim Chong Hee, a car­dio­tho­racic sur­geon in pri­vate prac­tice here, is be­ing reg­is­tered to prac­tise in Hainan. But he said any ac­tual work will have to wait till the Covid-19 pan­demic is over.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim, who vis­ited the Hainan zone in June, said he had not seen so many hos­pi­tals in one place be­fore. There was also a huge tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine hall.</p>
    <p>But get­ting to the zone was a bit of a has­sle, he said. From the air­port, one has to take an hour-long ex­press train ride, fol­lowed by a lo­cal train ride of about 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim said he would need to work with other heart spe­cial­ists to set up oper­a­tions at the med­i­cal cen­tre set up by Dr Tan, to en­sure con­tin­u­ing sup­port for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Or­thopaedic sur­geon Roland Chong is an­other doc­tor who is “def­i­nitely in­ter­ested”. He said his prac­tice in Hainan could start with tele-con­sul­ta­tion. When a rea­son­able pa­tient base has been built up, then doc­tors in his group could take turns to go there once ev­ery few weeks, or more fre­quently if the de­mand is high.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan de­scribed the tim­ing of the new cen­tre as per­fect be­cause for­eign pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore have dwin­dled to a trickle ow­ing to the pan­demic...
