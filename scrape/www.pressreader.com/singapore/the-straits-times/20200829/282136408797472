    <p>In­no­va­tive busi­ness ideas are an im­por­tant driver of growth, par­tic­u­larly in the cur­rent economic down­turn, said Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling.</p>
    <p>To this end, the Gov­ern­ment re­mains com­mit­ted to pro­vid­ing re­sources and help­ing to bring th­ese ideas to fruition, es­pe­cially those that do not fit neatly into ex­ist­ing reg­u­la­tory frame­works, she added.</p>
    <p>She was speak­ing to re­porters af­ter a visit to The Gym Pod at Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio Park yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 24-hour un­manned con­tainer gym com­pany’s lat­est ex­pan­sion into two pub­lic parks last month was a re­sult of help from the Pro-En­ter­prise Panel (PEP) un­der the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI).</p>
    <p>The PEP, set up in 2000, col­lab­o­rates with gov­ern­ment agen­cies and busi­nesses to stream­line rules with the aim of re­duc­ing the reg­u­la­tory bur­den.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said that as the econ­omy evolves amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, more busi­ness mod­els that cut across mul­ti­ple do­mains might emerge.</p>
    <p>“Each of th­ese new busi­ness mod­els with in­no­va­tive busi­ness con­cepts may not fall neatly in any ex­ist­ing reg­u­la­tory frame­work. It may cut across a few reg­u­la­tory frame­works. So this is where the PEP will play a very im­por­tant role,” she said.</p>
    <p>Since 2000, the PEP has re­ceived over 2,000 busi­ness ideas as well as feed­back on reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>SAFE AMID PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>Our con­cept was meant for pri­vacy. For­tu­nately, it also caters for safe dis­tanc­ing be­cause you’re not shar­ing the same space with an­other per­son. ’’</p>
    <p>MR DAMIAN CHOW, founder of The Gym Pod, ex­plain­ing a rise in the num­ber of cus­tomers since phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s reopen­ing be­gan in June, com­pared with the pre-cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Other suc­cess­ful ex­am­ples that have come to fruition with the PEP’s help in­clude the De­cathlon Sin­ga­pore Lab store, which opened last year, and Ship­ping Con­tainer Ho­tel, which of­fers stays in un­usual lo­ca­tions and was launched ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The Gym Pod’s founder Damian Chow said that with­out the PEP’s help, it would have had to talk to mul­ti­ple agen­cies sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>“It might have been a very long process be­cause we don’t know who to talk to. With PEP and MTI, it helped us to smooth out the com­mu­ni­ca­tion and make this process much faster,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the whole process – from eval­u­a­tion to rolling out the two gyms in pub­lic parks – took</p>
    <p>about nine months, al­though there were some de­lays due to the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The Gym Pod was launched in June 2018 and now has eight gyms in to­tal. Users can book ses­sions on­line and con­trol gym fa­cil­i­ties via a mo­bile app; only one or two peo­ple are al­lowed at a time in each pod.</p>
    <p>Other Covid-19 pre­cau­tions the gym has taken in­clude re­quir­ing users to com­plete a travel and sick­ness dec­la­ra­tion form and scan­ning their tem­per­a­ture with a no­touch de­vice be­fore us­ing the gym.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of users has risen since phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s reopen­ing be­gan in June, com­pared with the pre-cir­cuit breaker, said Mr Chow, 35.</p>
    <p>“Our con­cept was meant for pri­vacy. For­tu­nately, it also caters for safe dis­tanc­ing be­cause you’re not shar­ing the same space with an­other per­son. Be­cause of this, we saw our book­ings go up af­ter the cir­cuit breaker, com­pared with be­fore.”</p>
    <p>While each pod was used for an av­er­age of 10 to 11 hours a day be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, this has in­creased to 14 to 16 hours a day now. The in­crease is also partly due to the gym’s greater vis­i­bil­ity at Bis­han-Ang Mo Kio and Pung­gol parks, Mr Chow added.</p>
    <p>The Gym Pod aims to eval­u­ate and launch gyms in three more parks in the next few months, and to open 100 gyms in the next two years.</p>
