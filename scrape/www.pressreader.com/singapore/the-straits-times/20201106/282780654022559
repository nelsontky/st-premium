    <p>Hong Kong ac­tor­pro­ducer Gor­don Lam (left) is do­ing his part to help new ac­tors af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Lam, 53, said he and fel­low ac­tor­pro­ducer Louis Koo are pre­par­ing for a new hawker-themed movie ti­tled Egg Waf­fles, go­ing by a trans­la­tion of its Chi­nese ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia at a film fes­ti­val on Tues­day, Lam said the script has un­der­gone changes more than 10 times and that there is still room for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>He hopes there is no need for fur­ther changes when the script reaches Koo and that they can start film­ing next year.</p>
    <p>Lam, who has been nom­i­nated for Best Lead­ing Ac­tor for the movie Hand Rolled Cig­a­rette at the up­com­ing Golden Horse Awards, did not re­ceive a sin­gle cent for the movie.</p>
    <p>He said he will work on a movie for free if he can sup­port the Hong Kong film in­dus­try when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“My only con­di­tion for not re­ceiv­ing any money is that the movie must hire new ac­tors, so that there is suc­ces­sion in the in­dus­try,” he said.</p>
    <p>He and Koo will star in Egg Waf­fles and he has sug­gested to Koo that both of them act for free for the movie.</p>
    <p>“Many in­vestors will be un­will­ing to in­vest if the cost of mak­ing a movie is too high,” said Lam, who has acted in movies such as In­fer­nal Af­fairs (2002), Triv­isa (2016) and Para­dox (2017).</p>
    <p>He also told re­porters that he is un­cer­tain if he would at­tend the Golden Horse Awards in Taipei on Nov 21, as he is also in­volved in the post-pro­duc­tion of a movie star­ring vet­eran ac­tor Pa­trick Tse.</p>
    <p>“The chance is pretty slim, but I will try as there is al­ways hope in life,” he said.</p>
