    <p>MONZA Span­ish driver Car­los Sainz says he has no qualms about mov­ing from McLaren to Fer­rari next year de­spite the Ital­ian team’s strug­gles this sea­son.</p>
    <p>For­mula One man­ag­ing direc­tor Ross Brawn wrote in a col­umn this week that the 26-year-old “must be ner­vous about his prospects” af­ter Fer­rari’s dis­mal show­ing last week­end in Bel­gium, where Se­bas­tian Vet­tel and Charles Le­clerc fin­ished 13th and 14th re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Sainz, who will be re­plac­ing four­time world cham­pion Vet­tel at Maranello, told re­porters at Fer­rari’s home Ital­ian Grand Prix on Thurs­day that, given the op­tion, he would sign up 100 times over.</p>
    <p>“I’m very com­fort­able with the de­ci­sion I’ve taken,” he em­pha­sised. “I’m 100 per cent con­fi­dent in Fer­rari and in what they can do.</p>
    <p>“Last year they were ca­pa­ble of do­ing seven pole po­si­tions so it’s a team that I think knows how to pro­duce very good cars.</p>
    <p>“I’m fully con­fi­dent, I’m ready to go for Fer­rari next sea­son. I think it is such a unique ex­pe­ri­ence and such a spe­cial place for an F1 driver that I don’t think there’s ever go­ing to be a bad time where you say, ‘I do not want to go to Fer­rari’.”</p>
    <p>Sainz, who was un­able to start in Bel­gium due to a power unit prob­lem, is 22 points be­hind Bri­tish team­mate Lando Nor­ris (45) af­ter seven races, but still two places ahead of 13th-placed Vet­tel (16).</p>
    <p>Lewis Hamil­ton leads the stand­ings on 157 points and the Bri­ton has said he saw a clam­p­down on en­gine modes as a com­pli­ment to his dom­i­nant Mercedes team.</p>
    <p>Teams must now run their en­gines in the same mode in qual­i­fy­ing and the race af­ter the In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion is­sued a di­rec­tive aimed at mak­ing it eas­ier to mon­i­tor power units. Pre­vi­ously, driv­ers could use dif­fer­ent modes for per­for­mance when needed, par­tic­u­larly in qual­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>Mercedes have started all seven races on pole po­si­tion and won six, with Hamil­ton on top five times.</p>
    <p>“What’s crazy is this switch, they’ve said it’s for one rea­son and then you’ve got Red Bull who came out and said, ‘No, no, we were go­ing af­ter them to hold them back’,” he told Sky Sports tele­vi­sion. “So some­one is not telling the truth. All we can do is just smile and keep work­ing hard. I think (it) is a com­pli­ment at the end of the day.”</p>
