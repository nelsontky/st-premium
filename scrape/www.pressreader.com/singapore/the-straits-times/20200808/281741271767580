    <p>• The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has warned against “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism”, say­ing that vac­cine-hog­ging richer coun­tries would not be safe havens against the coro­n­avirus if poor na­tions re­mained ex­posed.</p>
    <p>WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said it would be in wealth­ier na­tions’ in­ter­ests to en­sure that any vac­cines even­tu­ally pro­duced to pro­tect against the new coro­n­avirus were shared glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism is not good, it will not help us,” Dr Te­dros told the Aspen Se­cu­rity Fo­rum in the United States on Thursday via video-link from the WHO’s head­quar­ters in Geneva.</p>
    <p>“For the world to re­cover faster, it has to re­cover to­gether, be­cause it is a glob­alised world. The economies are in­ter­twined. Part of the world or a few coun­tries can­not be a safe haven and re­cover.</p>
    <p>“The dam­age from Covid-19 could be less when those coun­tries who... have the fund­ing com­mit to this.”</p>
    <p>He said the ex­is­tence of the deadly re­s­pi­ra­tory dis­ease any­where puts lives and liveli­hoods at risk ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>“They are not giv­ing char­ity to oth­ers; they are do­ing it for them­selves be­cause when the rest of the world re­cov­ers and opens up, they also ben­e­fit.”</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions health agency also said that mul­ti­ple dif­fer­ent types of vac­cines would likely be needed to com­bat Covid-19. Twenty-six can­di­date vac­cines are in var­i­ous stages of be­ing tested on hu­mans, with six hav­ing reached phase three wider lev­els of clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>“Phase three doesn’t mean nearly there,” ex­plained the WHO’s emer­gen­cies direc­tor Michael Ryan.</p>
    <p>“Phase three means this is the first time this vac­cine has been put into the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion, into oth­er­wise healthy in­di­vid­u­als, to see if the vac­cine will pro­tect them against nat­u­ral in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have got a good range of prod­ucts across a num­ber of dif­fer­ent plat­forms, across a num­ber of dif­fer­ent coun­tries,” he said of the lead­ing can­di­date vac­cines, which use dif­fer­ent meth­ods to pro­vide im­mu­nity. How­ever, “there is no guar­an­tee that any of these six will give us the an­swer – and we prob­a­bly will need more than one vac­cine to do this job”.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has killed over 715,000 peo­ple and in­fected more than 19 mil­lion since the out­break emerged in China last De­cem­ber, ac­cord­ing to a tally from of­fi­cial sources com­piled by Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“The Amer­i­cas re­main the cur­rent epi­cen­tre of the virus and have been par­tic­u­larly hit hard,” said Dr Te­dros, with the US, Brazil and Mex­ico suf­fer­ing the most deaths.</p>
    <p>Asked about the virus rag­ing in the Amer­i­cas, Dr Ryan said no coun­try had al­ways found all the right an­swers, and a vast ex­pan­sion of the pub­lic health work­force was re­quired. “We need to take a step back, we need to look at the prob­lem again and we need to go at the prob­lem again,” he said. “That re­quires strong, sus­tained and trusted lead­er­ship.”</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has ac­cused the WHO of be­ing a “pup­pet” of China and mis­man­ag­ing its han­dling of the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton last month handed in its 12-month no­tice to leave the WHO, de­priv­ing the UN or­gan­i­sa­tion of its big­gest donor.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said the big­gest “prob­lem” with the US de­par­ture was “not about the money” but the frac­ture in in­ter­na­tional sol­i­dar­ity in fight­ing the coro­n­avirus. “We hope the US will re­con­sider its po­si­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Ethiopian for­mer health min­is­ter claimed any prob­lems Wash­ing­ton had with the WHO could be re­solved without the US leav­ing.</p>
    <p>“I hope the re­la­tion­ship will re­turn to nor­mal and be a stronger re­la­tion­ship than ever be­fore,” he said. “I urge all lead­ers to choose the path of co­op­er­a­tion... it is the only choice we have.”</p>
