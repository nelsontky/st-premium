    <p>The United States cham­pi­ons a free and open Indo-Pa­cific. To­day we are strength­en­ing US pol­icy in a vi­tal, con­tentious part of that re­gion – the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>We are mak­ing clear: Bei­jing’s claims to off­shore re­sources across most of the South China Sea are com­pletely un­law­ful, as is its cam­paign of bul­ly­ing to con­trol them.</p>
    <p>In the South China Sea, we seek to pre­serve peace and sta­bil­ity, up­hold free­dom of the seas in a man­ner con­sis­tent with in­ter­na­tional law, main­tain the unim­peded flow of com­merce, and op­pose any at­tempt to use co­er­cion or force to set­tle dis­putes. We share these deep and abid­ing in­ter­ests with our many al­lies and part­ners who have long en­dorsed a rules-based in­ter­na­tional or­der.</p>
    <p>These shared in­ter­ests have come un­der un­prece­dented threat from the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China (PRC). Bei­jing uses in­tim­i­da­tion to un­der­mine the sov­er­eign rights of South-east Asian coastal states in the South China Sea, bully them out of off­shore re­sources, as­sert uni­lat­eral dominion, and re­place in­ter­na­tional law with “might makes right”...</p>
    <p>The PRC has no le­gal grounds to uni­lat­er­ally im­pose its will on the re­gion. Bei­jing has of­fered no co­her­ent le­gal ba­sis for its “nine-dash line” claim in the South China Sea since for­mally an­nounc­ing it in 2009.</p>
    <p>In a unan­i­mous de­ci­sion on July 12, 2016, an ar­bi­tral tri­bunal con­sti­tuted un­der the 1982 Law of the Sea Con­ven­tion – to which the PRC is a state party – re­jected the PRC’s mar­itime claims as hav­ing no ba­sis in in­ter­na­tional law. The tri­bunal sided squarely with the Philip­pines, which brought the ar­bi­tra­tion case, on al­most all claims... To­day we are align­ing the US po­si­tion on the PRC’s mar­itime claims in the SCS (South China Sea) with the tri­bunal’s de­ci­sion...</p>
    <p>As Bei­jing has failed to put forth a law­ful, co­her­ent mar­itime claim in the South China Sea, the United</p>
    <p>States re­jects any PRC claim to wa­ters be­yond a 12 nau­ti­cal mile ter­ri­to­rial sea de­rived from is­lands it claims in the Spratly Is­lands (with­out prej­u­dice to other states’ sovereignt­y claims over such is­lands)...</p>
    <p>The PRC has no law­ful ter­ri­to­rial or mar­itime claim to (or de­rived from) James Shoal, an en­tirely sub­merged fea­ture only 50 nau­ti­cal miles from Malaysia and some 1,000 nau­ti­cal miles from China’s coast. James Shoal is of­ten cited in PRC pro­pa­ganda as the “south­ern­most ter­ri­tory of China”. In­ter­na­tional law is clear: An un­der­wa­ter fea­ture like James Shoal can­not be claimed by any state and is in­ca­pable of gen­er­at­ing mar­itime zones...</p>
    <p>The world will not al­low Bei­jing to treat the South China Sea as its mar­itime em­pire. Amer­ica stands with our South-east Asian al­lies and part­ners in pro­tect­ing their sov­er­eign rights to off­shore re­sources, con­sis­tent with their rights and obli­ga­tions un­der in­ter­na­tional law. We stand with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity in de­fence of free­dom of the seas and re­spect for sovereignt­y and re­ject any push to im­pose “might makes right” in the South China Sea or the wider re­gion.</p>
