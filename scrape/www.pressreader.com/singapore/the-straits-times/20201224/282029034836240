    <p>De­spite a phys­i­cal dis­abil­ity which causes con­stant pain and weak­ness in his arms, Mr Ravi Ra­jasagaran worked his way up in the back-break­ing clean­ing in­dus­try – from be­ing a cleaner to su­per­vis­ing dozens of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>For his hard work, re­silience and mo­ti­va­tion to learn, he was one of 27 work­ers in the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices in­dus­try who re­ceived the En­vi­ron­men­tal Ser­vices (ES) Star Awards from the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi, who had been in and out of prison 14 times un­til 2014, said the award is his big­gest achieve­ment to date.</p>
    <p>“In the past, I would never have ex­pected to achieve this. My dream is to be an NEA en­vi­ron­men­tal con­trol of­fi­cer,” said the 38-year-old.</p>
    <p>He started as a cleaner in 2018. Over a two-year pe­riod, he took nine Work­force Skills Qual­i­fi­ca­tions cour­ses and now over­sees 50 to 80 clean­ers as an oper­a­tions man­ager at Clear3 En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>When man­power is tight, he helps with the du­ties although the work takes a toll on his body.</p>
    <p>He said: “I get tired very fast, so I need to rest for 10 min­utes and drink wa­ter af­ter ev­ery hour of work. I hang heavy garbage bags on my up­per arm if I can­not lift them us­ing my hands.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi was di­ag­nosed in 2013 with Hi­rayama dis­ease, a rare neu­ro­log­i­cal con­di­tion which causes mus­cle wast­ing and weak­ness in the fore­arms and hands. As a re­sult, he can carry only a 4kg load in his right hand and 2kg in his left hand, which has only three fin­gers that are mo­bile.</p>
    <p>Due to his dis­abil­ity, he strug­gled to land a per­ma­nent job un­til Clear3 En­vi­ron­ment hired him.</p>
    <p>The an­nual ES Star Awards, which started last year, recog­nises the in­dus­try’s ex­em­plary em­ploy­ees across the clean­ing ser­vices, waste man­age­ment and pest man­age­ment sec­tors.</p>
    <p>An­other 350 work­ers from 58 com­pa­nies were given con­grat­u­la­tory cer­tifi­cates for their con­tri­bu­tions and com­mit­ment to the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Awardees re­ceived $100 worth of vouchers, while the 350 em­ploy­ees re­ceived $50 in vouchers.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu, who was the guest of hon­our at the awards cer­e­mony, ac­knowl­edged that many com­pa­nies and work­ers in the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices in­dus­try had to cope with ad­di­tional de­mands for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion ser­vices this year, due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“De­spite these chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances, our front-line en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices heroes stepped up to the chal­lenge and con­tin­ued to... main­tain high stan­dards of pub­lic hy­giene,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu noted that be­yond Covid-19, de­mand for qual­ity and re­spon­sive en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices will re­main high, to main­tain pub­lic health and hy­giene. She added that the in­dus­try needs to lever­age tech­nol­ogy and em­ploy a skilled work­force.</p>
    <p>Other ES Star Awards re­cip­i­ents in­clude Mr Azlam Shah Alias, 41, founder of AZantz Ser­vices, and Ms Quek Rui Ting, 29, an en­to­mol­o­gist at Ikari Ser­vices. Both com­pa­nies spe­cialise in pest con­trol.</p>
    <p>Mr Azlam, who joined the pest con­trol scene 15 years ago as a worker hunt­ing mosquitoes and con­trol­ling dengue clus­ters, started his own com­pany last year.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves there are op­por­tu­ni­ties to grow in the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices in­dus­try, and plans to send his staff for bird and rep­tile man­age­ment cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Ms Quek, a life sciences grad­u­ate who stud­ies in­sects, de­signs pest man­age­ment pro­grammes for clients and trains pest con­trol tech­ni­cians.</p>
