    <p>The Swap Of­fer Rate (SOR) is used in pric­ing of bonds and loans to large in­sti­tu­tions with hedg­ing re­quire­ments. It is also the ref­er­ence bench­mark in Sin­ga­pore dol­lar de­riv­a­tives...</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora) was se­lected as the new in­ter­est rate bench­mark as it was found to be the</p>
    <p>“most ro­bust and suit­able al­ter­na­tive”, un­der­pinned by a deep and liq­uid overnight fund­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The is­su­ing of loans and se­cu­ri­ties linked to the Swap Of­fer Rate (SOR) that ma­ture af­ter end-2021 will need to cease by next April, in a push by a fi­nan­cial in­dus­try-led com­mit­tee to shift away from the use of SOR to the Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora) in fi­nan­cial prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>To sup­port this, all do­mes­tic sys­tem­i­cally im­por­tant banks (D-SIBs) should be ready to of­fer new Sorabased prod­ucts to cus­tomers by end-Fe­bru­ary. The rest of the banks have un­til end-April. And by endSeptem­ber, all other banks are to have sub­stan­tially re­duced gross ex­po­sures to SOR de­riv­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Th­ese se­ries of in­dus­try time­lines, an­nounced yes­ter­day, aim to steadily re­duce ex­po­sures to SOR be­fore end-2021, in prepa­ra­tion for</p>
    <p>US dol­lar (USD) Li­bor and SOR dis­con­tin­u­a­tion while en­sur­ing that Sora-based prod­ucts are avail­able to meet fi­nanc­ing needs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in the midst of its move from SOR to Sora as the new in­ter­est rate bench­mark, on the back of the dis­con­tin­u­a­tion of the Lon­don In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Li­bor) at the end of next year, which would af­fect SOR as it uses the USD Li­bor in its com­pu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>SOR is used in pric­ing of bonds and loans to large in­sti­tu­tions with hedg­ing re­quire­ments. It is also the ref­er­ence bench­mark in Sin­ga­pore dol­lar (SGD) de­riv­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Close to $1.4 tril­lion no­tional value of out­stand­ing SGD de­riv­a­tives con­tracts ref­er­enc­ing SOR, and about 12,000 SOR con­tracts in SGD cash mar­kets amount­ing to $95 bil­lion will ma­ture af­ter the end of next year, and will need to tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Sora was se­lected as the new in­ter­est rate bench­mark as it was found to be the “most ro­bust and suit­able al­ter­na­tive”, un­der­pinned by a deep and liq­uid overnight fund­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Af­ter end-April 2021, Sora is ex­pected to be the de facto float­ing rate bench­mark for all in­sti­tu­tional SGD fi­nanc­ing ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The steer­ing com­mit­tee for SOR tran­si­tion to Sora or SC-STS – con­sist­ing of in­dus­try, as­so­ci­a­tions and the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) – yes­ter­day pub­lished a set of mar­ket guides to help users pre­pare for the shift and for adop­tion of Sora across a range of fi­nan­cial prod­ucts in­clud­ing de­riv­a­tives, float­ing rate notes, busi­ness and re­tail loans.</p>
    <p>They in­clude a re­port on how Sora can be used in loans to meet the var­i­ous needs of fi­nan­cial firms, large cor­po­rates, small and medium-sized en­ter­prises and re­tail cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>A Sora mar­ket com­pen­dium gives mar­ket par­tic­i­pants a com­pre­hen­sive over­view of Sora mar­ket con­ven­tions across de­riv­a­tives, float­ing rate notes, busi­ness and re­tail loans.</p>
    <p>A Sora guide tar­geted at cor­po­rate users and a pam­phlet for re­tail cus­tomers will also be pub­lished with links to rel­e­vant other in­for­ma­tion for th­ese user groups.</p>
    <p>Mr Sa­muel Tsien, chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore and SC-STS, said the com­mit­tee has largely com­pleted the key tech­ni­cal prepa­ra­tion and laid the foun­da­tion for wide­spread use of Sora in a full range of fi­nan­cial prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“This will pave the way for an or­derly and smooth tran­si­tion from the legacy use of SOR to Sora as the new bench­mark for SGD mar­kets,” said Mr Tsien, who is also the group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>He urged mar­ket par­tic­i­pants to take im­me­di­ate steps, in­clud­ing mak­ing op­er­a­tional and sys­tem changes, staff train­ing and client outreach, to pre­pare for the shift from SOR to Sora.</p>
    <p>MAS deputy man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Jac­que­line Loh, a mem­ber of the SC-STS, said that the cen­tral bank ex­pects all mar­ket par­tic­i­pants to re­duce their ex­po­sures to SOR, and to ac­tively pro­mote the un­der­stand­ing of and mi­gra­tion to Sora fi­nan­cial prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“This will en­sure that our fi­nan­cial sys­tem is well-pre­pared for the tran­si­tion to Sora, through the de­vel­op­ment of a deep and ef­fi­cient Sora-cen­tred SGD mar­ket,” she said.</p>
