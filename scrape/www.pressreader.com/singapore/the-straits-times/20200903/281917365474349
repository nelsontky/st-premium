    <p>In­done­sia plans to build in­ter­na­tional-stan­dard hospi­tals in Jakarta, Den­pasar in Bali and Medan in a pi­lot project to re­duce the num­ber of In­done­sians trav­el­ling over­seas to seek med­i­cal treat­ment, a se­nior minister has said.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy is also con­sid­er­ing al­low­ing for­eign med­i­cal spe­cial­ists to prac­tise in these three cities, pro­vided they work closely with lo­cal doc­tors to en­sure trans­fer of knowl­edge, Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Minister Luhut Pand­jai­tan said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s plan was prompted by its hope of sav­ing on for­eign ex­change out­flows in an econ­omy that has been badly hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Some In­done­sians pre­fer go­ing to Pe­nang and Sin­ga­pore on con­sid­er­a­tion that the med­i­cal ser­vice there is rel­a­tively af­ford­able and they get well faster,” ac­cord­ing to Mr Luhut’s In­sta­gram post.</p>
    <p>At least 600,000 In­done­sian med­i­cal tourists a year fly out of the coun­try for treat­ment, most of them to Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, with each spend­ing between US$3,000 ($S4,000) and US$10,000. What they spend com­pares to In­done­sia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct per capita of just above US$4,000.</p>
    <p>If these sums were spent do­mes­ti­cally in­stead, jobs would be cre­ated and for­eign in­vest­ment would pump money into health­care ser­vices, Mr Luhut said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia pro­vide treat­ments from tummy tucks to surgery linked to can­cer.</p>
    <p>To­tal spend­ing by In­done­sians an­nu­ally on med­i­cal bills in over­seas hospi­tals could reach US$6 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to a gov­ern­ment es­ti­mate.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Frans San­tosa, who sits on the board of ethics of the In­done­sian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, gives a higher fig­ure of US$10 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Bali is In­done­sia’s most-vis­ited tourist site, while Medan is the largest city in the coun­try’s sec­ond most pop­u­lous is­land, Su­ma­tra.</p>
    <p>To en­tice In­done­sians to seek treat­ment in the coun­try, the gov­ern­ment is look­ing at al­low­ing for­eign spe­cial­ists to prac­tise in lo­cal hospi­tals. If a treat­ment leads to a le­gal dis­pute over neg­li­gence, the for­eign doc­tors would be likely to face the same con­se­quences as lo­cal doc­tors would, ac­cord­ing to ex­perts.</p>
    <p>For­eign doc­tors cur­rently can­not prac­tise medicine in In­done­sia un­less they pass the lo­cal doc­tors’ bar exam and are awarded a li­cence, ac­cord­ing to the In­done­sian Doc­tors As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked about this reg­u­la­tion by The Straits Times, Mr Luhut said by phone on Satur­day night that the bu­reau­cracy for a for­eign doc­tor to ob­tain a per­mit to prac­tise medicine in In­done­sia needs to be sim­pli­fied.</p>
    <p>“We will study all the reg­u­la­tions that may need re­vi­sions,” the minister said.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment would be very se­lec­tive by al­low­ing in only for­eign doc­tors with very high ex­per­tise, and lo­cal doc­tors would ben­e­fit from the trans­fer of knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Mr Luhut said that with the pan­demic still rag­ing around the world, In­done­sian pa­tients are likely to can­cel their over­seas med­i­cal trips as many coun­tries have im­posed 14-day quar­an­tines on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>But not all would can­cel them. “I have been with the same doc­tor in Sin­ga­pore since the early 2000s and I am stick­ing with him,” said Ms Pus­paryanti Sjam­sud­din, 56, a house­wife who sur­vived breast can­cer af­ter she was treated at Park­way Can­cer Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>She still trav­els to Sin­ga­pore ev­ery six months for rou­tine check­ups. “Oth­ers may move to In­done­sian hospi­tals on more com­pet­i­tive fees, but I will not,” she said.</p>
    <p>Prof Frans, a med­i­cal doc­tor who spent 20 years of his ca­reer in Ger­many, sees the gov­ern­ment plan’s as fea­si­ble, say­ing In­done­sian medi</p>
    <p>cal tourists also go to Aus­tralia, Ger­many and the United States, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“For­eign spe­cial­ists who are al­lowed to come here un­der a trans­fer-of-knowl­edge pro­gramme must be top-notch med­i­cal doc­tors who have had good track records… and have good hu­man re­la­tions,” Prof Frans told ST.</p>
    <p>Mr Luhut ar­gued that the med­i­cal skills of In­done­sian doc­tors are com­pa­ra­ble to those of doc­tors abroad, point­ing out as an ex­am­ple the high num­bers of pa­tients who have re­cov­ered from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has recorded a 72.6 per cent re­cov­ery rate among Covid-19 pa­tients, com­pared with the global rate of 69.4 per cent, Mr Luhut said.</p>
