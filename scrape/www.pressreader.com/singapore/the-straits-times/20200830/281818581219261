    <p>When Ms Lee Yi­han’s 13-year-old Jack Russell Nova fell crit­i­cally ill with can­cer last month, the grief­stricken lawyer and her family de­cided to put it down and ar­range for a dig­ni­fied send-off for their pet dog.</p>
    <p>Through in­quiries on­line, Ms Lee en­listed the ser­vices of Ex­press Pet Cre­ma­tion and paid $550 for a euthana­sia pro­ce­dure cum pri­vate cre­ma­tion cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>When Ex­press Pet Cre­ma­tion’s boss, Mr Pa­trick Lim Thye Song, showed up at her family’s home to col­lect Nova’s body af­ter the dog was eu­thanised by a vet, he told the family they could not view the cre­ma­tion due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. Mr Lim in­formed the Lees that he would take Nova’s body to the cre­ma­tion cen­tre him­self.</p>
    <p>Un­happy that she and her family could not be at the cre­ma­tion, among other things, Ms Lee said she went on­line and found complaints about Mr Lim’s com­pany on the In­ter­net. She said that when she asked Mr Lim where ex­actly her dog was cre­mated and how the body was han­dled, Mr Lim did not give her an an­swer she was sat­is­fied with.</p>
    <p>Con­cerned about how her dog’s cre­ma­tion was han­dled, Ms Lee made a po­lice re­port. She took the re­mains – still sealed in the urn – for lab­o­ra­tory test­ing at The Foren­sics Ex­perts Group, a com­mer­cial foren­sics firm.</p>
    <p>A week later, the test, which cost her $800, was com­pleted. The lab­o­ra­tory said in its re­port that the re­sult was “in­con­clu­sive as to whether the con­tents of the urn are from the pet cre­ma­tion process”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the sub­stance in the urn ap­peared to be hy­drox­ya­p­atite, a ma­jor com­po­nent of bone and teeth</p>
