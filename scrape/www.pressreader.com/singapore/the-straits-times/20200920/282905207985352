    <p>There’s never been a bet­ter time to be a couch potato in South-east Asia. The re­gion is be­ing flooded by video-on-de­mand stream­ing services – whether home-grown or im­ported from the US or China.</p>
    <p>And they come with steep dis­counts and lo­cal con­tent to coax tens of mil­lions of con­sumers away from free plat­forms like YouTube and into pay­ing for a sub­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment gi­ant Dis­ney ear­lier this month in­tro­duced its Dis­ney+ Hot­star sub­scrip­tion ser­vice in In­done­sia, un­leash­ing its cat­a­logue of princesses, su­per­heroes and the Star Wars fran­chise on the 60 mil­lion or so cit­i­zens with dis­pos­able in­come and In­ter­net-ready mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts point to mo­bile sub­scrip­tions for less than $20 a year, ubiq­ui­tous smart­phones and a cap­tive au­di­ence quar­an­tined at home by the Covid-19 out­break as lay­ing the ground­work for rapid growth in the video-on-de­mand seg­ment.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s mar­ket for stream­ing will be worth US$1.4 bil­lion (S$1.9 bil­lion) by the end of the year, and will more than dou­ble to US$3.6 bil­lion by 2025, helped by bal­loon­ing de­mand, ac­cord­ing to con­sul­tancy Me­dia Part­ners Asia.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 10 weeks from midMarch to the mid­dle of June, view­ers in a cross sec­tion of the re­gion’s big­gest stream­ing mar­kets – Sin­ga­pore, Thai­land, In­done­sia and the</p>
    <p>Philip­pines – were binge­ing on a com­bined 5.1 bil­lion min­utes of sub­scrip­tion-based on-de­mand pro­gram­ming a week. Dur­ing the pre­vi­ous 10-week pe­riod, the tally was less than half that.</p>
    <p>Mr Vivek Couto, co-founder of Me­dia Part­ners Asia, be­lieves Dis­ney’s en­try into South-east Asia will spark an­other round of rapid growth. “We are still in the first in­nings,” he says.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney will chal­lenge Net­flix for its dom­i­nant po­si­tion in the still small pool of sub­scribers.</p>
    <p>For now, Net­flix rakes in 44 per cent of the stream­ing rev­enue out of South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Viu, from Hong Kong’s PCCW Me­dia, which leans heav­ily on South Korean dra­mas, ac­counts for a fifth of the mar­ket, Me­dia Part­ners Asia says. Line TV, which is big in Thai­land, Vidio, iFlix, GoPlay and a host of oth­ers divvy up the rest.</p>
    <p>Net­flix has said it has 22.5 mil­lion sub­scribers in all of Asia and Aus­tralia, although it does not break down the data fur­ther.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, an es­ti­mated 150 mil­lion in South-east Asia reg­u­larly shop on­line, ac­cord­ing to the 2019 e-Con­omy re­port pub­lished by Google, Te­masek and man­age­ment con­sul­tancy Bain & Com­pany.</p>
    <p>In May, Dis­ney Chan­nel, Dis­ney XD and Dis­ney Ju­nior stopped broad­cast­ing on Sing­tel and StarHub. Dis­ney+ has notched up 60.5 mil­lion sub­scrip­tions in North Amer­ica, Europe, Aus­tralia and New Zealand.</p>
    <p>A roll-out in more mar­kets is in</p>
    <p>store, but Dis­ney won’t say when.</p>
    <p>When it comes to fac­ing off with en­ter­tain­ment giants, Net­flix, which started as a DVD ren­tal busi­ness, says it has seen this movie be­fore.</p>
    <p>“We’ve faced com­pe­ti­tion be­fore,” says Ms Myleeta Aga Wil­liams, di­rec­tor of con­tent for South-east Asia and Aus­tralia for Net­flix. “It’s al­ways been about con­tent that works for us.”</p>
    <p>Driv­ing sub­scrip­tions are rock­bot­tom fees.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney+ is charg­ing 39,000 ru­piah (S$3.60) a month, un­der­cut­ting Net­flix’s 54,000 ru­piah.</p>
    <p>Get­ting big­ger on the hori­zon, too, are ri­val of­fer­ings from Chi­nese stream­ing services.</p>
    <p>In June, China’s Ten­cent bought the loss-mak­ing stream­ing ser­vice iFlix to beef up its WeTV busi­ness, which is al­ready avail­able in Thai­land, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier that same month, IQiyi, (pro­nounced eye-chi-i), from In­ter­net gi­ant Baidu, head­hunted a top</p>
    <p>Net­flix re­gional man­ager of gov­ern­ment re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a shake-out has al­ready be­gun. Hooq Dig­i­tal, set up in Jan­uary 2015 by Sing­tel, Warner Broth­ers and Sony Pic­tures, folded in April.</p>
    <p>And there are reg­u­la­tory headaches, too.</p>
    <p>In May, In­done­sia’s big­gest pri­vate broad­caster, MNC, which is iFlix’s lo­cal part­ner, sued in the coun­try’s Con­sti­tu­tional Court to halt all so­cial me­dia live stream­ing and video-on-de­mand services un­less the plat­forms are held to the same per­mit re­quire­ments as broad­cast­ers. The gov­ern­ment op­poses the suit.</p>
    <p>So far, the re­gion’s con­sumers are tak­ing two sub­scrip­tions on av­er­age per house­hold, com­pared with four in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Even at that rate of adop­tion, some services will be el­bowed out.</p>
    <p>“If there are four or five sur­vivors,” Mr Couto says, “who are they go­ing to be?”</p>
