    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The LPGA Tour will restart its coro­n­avirus-interrupte­d sea­son later this month, but many more speed bumps are ex­pected, com­mis­sioner Mike Whan said.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the July 31-Aug 2 Drive On Cham­pi­onship in Toledo, Ohio – the first elite women’s golf event to take place af­ter a 51/ 2- month stop­page – he is re­main­ing pos­i­tive, but has braced him­self for pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests and as many as three events to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen tour­na­ments have al­ready fallen vic­tim to the cri­sis, in­clud­ing the HSBC Women’s World Cham­pi­onship in Sin­ga­pore and one of the five Ma­jors, the Evian</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The LPGA will ben­e­fit from us­ing many of the same health and safety pro­to­cols em­ployed by the PGA Tour, which has staged six tour­na­ments since re­turn­ing last month.</p>
    <p>But even with rigid test­ing and com­pre­hen­sive safety mea­sures, Whan ad­mit­ted pos­i­tive tests were in­evitable, some­thing the PGA Tour has had to deal with.</p>
    <p>“It is strange to get started in a time in which we know we’re go­ing to have pos­i­tive re­sults no mat­ter what we build,” he said on Wed­nes­day. “It won’t be any­body’s fault per se but pos­i­tive re­sults hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­cited about the sched­ule we have and at the same time, 120 days into coro­n­avirus, I re­alise we are re­ally not in charge of that sched­ule. I fully be­lieve we’ll lose an­other event or two or three along the way.”</p>
    <p>While the Drive On Cham­pi­onship will be held with­out fans, Whan con­firmed the cir­cuit was still con­sid­er­ing whether to ad­mit spec­ta­tors for the fol­low­ing Marathon Clas­sic from Aug 6-9.</p>
    <p>The PGA Tour has al­ready con­firmed there will be no gallery for the re­main­der of its sea­son amid surg­ing Covid-19 num­bers across the US and the LPGA Tour will de­cide whether to fol­low suit soon.</p>
    <p>“We’ll make a de­ci­sion on fans at the end of the week,” said Whan. “They (Marathon or­gan­is­ers) are wait­ing for some lo­cal health in­put. If we have fans, it will be 2,000 or less a day.”</p>
    <p>New cases are av­er­ag­ing around 60,000 a day and over 140,000 Amer­i­cans have died be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
