    <p>This month’s pick of 10 new re­leases by home-grown mu­si­cians range from the con­tem­pla­tive to the ca­co­phonic. Singer-song­writer Jean Tan’s sopho­more EP, Blooms, is folksy; the de­but al­bum by screamo su­per­group Naedr, Past Is Pro­logue, bris­tles with vis­ceral en­ergy. Sea­soned acts Sezairi and M1LDL1FE are pen­sive in their new songs. There are also de­but sin­gles from two new names – Hello Mec and whirring.</p>
    <p>1 SCREAMO PAST IS PRO­LOGUE</p>
    <p>Naedr</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/3qbLpCS</p>
    <p>Equal parts in­tense and moody, Past Is Pro­logue is the de­but al­bum from screamo band Naedr (pro­nounced “nadir”).</p>
    <p>Formed last year, the quin­tet (above) might be rel­a­tively new but their mem­bers are old hats in the un­der­ground and al­ter­na­tive mu­sic scene. They in­clude mu­si­cians who have played in es­tab­lished acts such as Am­a­teur Takes Con­trol, hauste and Paris In The Mak­ing.</p>
    <p>2 IN­DIE ROCK CAN’T SEEM TO GET ANY­THING</p>
    <p>M1LDL1FE</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/2Jn­bX3p</p>
    <p>The catchy melody and ear-worm cho­rus in in­die quar­tet M1LDL1FE’s new sin­gle be­lie a som­bre mes­sage of deal­ing with de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>The song, front­man Paddy Ong ex­plains, serves as both a cry for help and a way for the band to be open about their feel­ings.</p>
    <p>“The song is a man­i­fes­ta­tion of some of the low points we have had in our per­sonal lives over the past cou­ple of years – per­sonal losses, re­la­tion­ship is­sues, men­tal health strug­gles – in ad­di­tion to the stresses of the daily grind,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“We’re only hu­man and some­times it just feels like your mind is all seized up when it gets too much. You get paral­ysed with ev­ery­thing that’s go­ing on and you just can’t do any­thing and can’t get out of your own head.”</p>
    <p>3 BED­ROOM POP PER­FECT GIRL</p>
    <p>Hello Mec</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/3fQMFXc</p>
    <p>Per­fect Girl is the breezy de­but sin­gle by Hello Mec, the new per­sona of singer-song­writer Adam Ang.</p>
    <p>The mon­icker trans­lates to “hello man” in French slang, a nod to his grow­ing up years in France.</p>
    <p>The for­mer mem­ber of pop rock out­fit Scar­let Av­enue says: “The song was in­spired over a night out, meet­ing some­one you vibe with and hop­ing that through­out the night, she can get you be­cause you’re not good at ex­press­ing your­self.”</p>
    <p>4 IN­DIE/FOLK/SOUL</p>
    <p>BLOOMS</p>
    <p>Jean Tan</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/2Vi­aJcg</p>
    <p>Blooms is singer-song­writer Jean Tan’s fol­low-up to her 2017 EP, Hide­away. The songs cel­e­brate the light and re­birth that come af­ter dark­ness and death.</p>
    <p>Tan (right) says: “I wanted to give the feel­ing of drift­ing off into the prom­ise of another day, fol­lowed by another day, and another.</p>
    <p>“I wanted lis­ten­ers to un­der­stand that at the end of the day, peo­ple heal, sys­tems are re­stored, we move for­ward as life re­sumes as it al­ways will.”</p>
    <p>5 AL­TER­NA­TIVE POP/CHILLWAVE (FEEL LIKE) DANC­ING ALONE</p>
    <p>Lin­coln Lim & Houg</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3mt5FOc</p>
    <p>Singer-song­writer Lin­coln Lim has teamed up with singer-pro­ducer Houg for a sin­gle that melds their in­di­vid­ual styles.</p>
    <p>Houg says: “It was about cre­atively chal­leng­ing my­self, to com­bine Lin­coln’s more folksy-al­ter­na­tive rock with the tra­di­tion­ally synth-heavy sound I’m used to.”</p>
    <p>Lim was en­thu­si­as­tic about work­ing with Houg. “For me, I’ve al­ways been a fan of the in­tri­cate and thor­oughly dif­fer­ent pro­duc­tion work Houg de­liv­ers. An op­por­tu­nity to ex­per­i­ment with that and just see what hap­pens was one that ex­cited me when I first thought about it, and still ex­cites me to­day,” he says.</p>
    <p>6 ELEC­TRONIC POP IF YOU’D HAVE ME</p>
    <p>whirring</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3ll­gSih</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic pop duo whirring, made up of singer/ pro­duc­ers Aqid Ai­man and Michelle Jeon, took a year to re­fine their de­but sin­gle.</p>
    <p>“Ninety per cent of the song was writ­ten as a demo in two weeks, but we have spent a year get­ting to know our own mu­sic and work­ing on all the lit­tle de­tails,” they say.</p>
    <p>“We are both at a pretty trans­for­ma­tional stage in our lives as well and the idea of want­ing to achieve some­thing yet hold­ing your­self back res­onated re­ally strongly. We are thrilled to be able to con­dense these emo­tions into some­thing widely re­lat­able.”</p>
    <p>Formed in 2018, the pair were part of the sec­ond sea­son of The Great Sin­ga­pore Replay, a home-grown mu­sic ini­tia­tive last year that saw them men­tored by singer-song­writer Shabir and pro­duc­ers Ja­son Gelchen.</p>
    <p>7 AL­TER­NA­TIVE ROCK TAK­ING SI­LENCE</p>
    <p>Jonny Ong & Inch</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Singer, song­writer and hand­pan player Jonny Ong ropes in singer-song­writer Inch Chua on his lat­est sin­gle.</p>
    <p>“Some­times col­lab­o­ra­tions can feel forced, but with Inch, it felt nat­u­ral,” he says of Tak­ing Si­lence, which melds gen­res such as psy­che­delic rock, New Or­leans jazz and trip hop. The song is taken from his up­com­ing al­bum Iso­la­tion. “It was all about hav­ing fun on this al­bum – ex­per­i­ment­ing and do­ing things I wouldn’t usu­ally do,” he says.</p>
    <p>8 POP/FUNK RAIN­DROPS</p>
    <p>Sezairi</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3g2L29j</p>
    <p>Singer-song­writer Sezairi’s smooth sin­gle is a la­ment about los­ing all that you once held dear.</p>
    <p>“I wanted this song to rep­re­sent how the rain out­side your win­dow holds du­al­ity in its mean­ing and can some­times act as a dou­ble-edged sword: it once kept (lovers) close for warmth in­side but is much colder when there’s no em­brace.”</p>
    <p>Sung in both English and Malay, it is the first sin­gle from the win­ner of the third Sin­ga­pore Idol com­pe­ti­tion in 2009 since he re­leased the Un­der­tones EP early this year.</p>
    <p>9 R&B SCORPIO</p>
    <p>Keyana</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3lq0bCn</p>
    <p>The sopho­more sin­gle from bud­ding R&B singer­song­writer Keyana is based on her ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing in a toxic re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old, who has also made her name as a model, felt trapped and was un­able to make de­ci­sions on her own.</p>
    <p>“This song en­cap­su­lates the frus­tra­tion and pain I felt be­ing in a re­la­tion­ship like that, calling out the toxic pat­terns I ob­served dur­ing that time, while re­flect­ing on my strength of be­ing able to walk away from such a painful re­la­tion­ship,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I hope peo­ple who re­late to my story and lyrics are able to feel my in­ten­sity and des­per­a­tion in this song.”</p>
    <p>Keyana, whose par­ents are Ghana­ian and Sin­ga­porean-Chi­nese, is ex­pected to re­lease her de­but EP next year.</p>
    <p>10 POP/BAL­LAD HATE HOW YOU LOVE ME</p>
    <p>Soph Retief</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3fVU1Zx</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based singer Soph Retief con­tends with heart­break and loss in her new sin­gle.</p>
    <p>“Song­writ­ing is ther­a­peu­tic for me,” she says. “With this track, I got to re­ally dive into emo­tions to try to make sense of them.”</p>
    <p>The singer, who is of Bri­tish and South African de­scent, won MTV Asia’s re­gional singing con­test, Project Aloft Star, in 2016.</p>
