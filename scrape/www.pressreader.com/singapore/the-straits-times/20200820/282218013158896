    <p>Sin­ga­pore is blaz­ing a trail in the global ef­fort to re­place Libor, be­com­ing one of the first coun­tries to auc­tion debt linked to an al­ter­na­tive bench­mark.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) sold $500 mil­lion of six-month notes with a spread over the com­pounded Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora) on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is adopt­ing Sora as it moves away from the SGD Swap Of­fer Rate (SOR), which uses the Lon­don in­ter­bank of­fered rate (Libor) in com­pu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>The move is part of a broader push as pol­i­cy­mak­ers around the world de­velop new bench­marks to re­place Libor by the end of next year, after trad­ing in­form­ing the rate dried up and Euro­pean and US banks were found to have ma­nip­u­lated it for their own gain.</p>
    <p>“It’s a ground-break­ing ini­tia­tive,” said Mr Claude Brown, a part­ner at Reed Smith in Lon­don. “It looks like MAS has al­ready beaten the US Trea­sury to it.”</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of tril­lions of dol­lars worth of global as­sets are still tied to Libor, from stu­dent loans and mort­gages to in­ter­est-rate swaps and col­lat­er­alised loan obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say banks, busi­nesses and other na­tional au­thor­i­ties could fol­low Sin­ga­pore’s ex­am­ple after the tran­si­tion lost steam amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s a big deal,” said Mr John Cole­man, se­nior man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the fixed-in­come group at R.J. O’Brien & As­so­ciates in Chicago. “The buy-side com­mu­nity has to ad­just. When they see a govern­ment go­ing this way, it’s no longer a gim­mick or some­thing that may go away.”</p>
    <p>In the US, the Trea­sury is “very se­ri­ously study­ing the is­sue”, said Mr Jon Hill, US rates strate­gist at BMO Cap­i­tal Mar­kets. “I ex­pect them to for­mally an­nounce SOFR-linked debt this year,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Se­cured Overnight Fi­nanc­ing Rate, the Fed­eral Re­serve’s pre­ferred re­place­ment for dol­lar Libor.</p>
    <p>Asia has lagged be­hind the rest of the world in pre­par­ing for the change but Sin­ga­pore could of­fer a re­gional tem­plate for the shift.</p>
    <p>A few debt se­cu­ri­ties have al­ready been is­sued off Sora, in­clud­ing those from de­vel­oper Cap­i­taLand and the coun­try’s big­gest lender, DBS Group Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Eleven banks, in­clud­ing Deutsche Bank, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, Citibank and DBS Group, are ready to trade Sora deriva­tives, ac­cord­ing to a June state­ment.</p>
    <p>Progress on es­tab­lish­ing al­ter­na­tive ref­er­ence rates across the rest of Asia has been patchy.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, the Trea­sury Mar­kets As­so­ci­a­tion has iden­ti­fied the Hong Kong Dol­lar Overnight In­dex Av­er­age, or Ho­nia, as an al­ter­na­tive rate to the Hong Kong in­ter­bank of­fered rate. The first Ho­nia-linked in­ter­est rate swap was cen­trally cleared last month.</p>
    <p>Ho­nia still lacks trac­tion in Hong Kong, partly be­cause banks can con­tinue to ref­er­ence Hi­bor for ex­ist­ing and fu­ture loan prod­ucts be­yond next year, said Mr Fran­cis Chan, se­nior an­a­lyst at Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s move “may con­vince other gov­ern­ments and ju­ris­dic­tions to look at their own prac­tices”, said Mr Jonathan Ho­ran, a part­ner at Lin­klaters in Sin­ga­pore. “Every­one needs to fo­cus on this as the date for Libor dis­con­tin­u­ance looms.”</p>
