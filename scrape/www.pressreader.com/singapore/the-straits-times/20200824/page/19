They allow for different degrees and types of movement. Occasional­ly, due to degenerati­on or wear and tear, a joint may need to be replaced (joint replacemen­t surgery). The 206 bones in the human body form the skeletal system, which in turn provides support, movement via joints and muscles, protection for internal organs, blood cell production, and storage of minerals like calcium. Conditions that can affect bones include fractures (broken bones) and osteoporos­is (brittle bones). Dr Koo did his overseas fellowship at St Mary's and Charing Cross Hospitals, Imperial College Healthcare in London, UK, where he worked with internatio­nally recognised surgeons and was involved in the management of elite athletes and profession­al dancers. He has presented extensivel­y at internatio­nal, regional and local conference­s, and has more than
30 publicatio­ns in various medical journals. Tendons & Muscles Cartilage A tendon is a band of fibrous connective tissue that connects muscle to bone. As a muscle contracts, the attached tendon pulls the bone into movement. Inflammati­on, degenerati­on or tears of the tendon can occur, resulting in pain and loss of function. In the joints, hyaline cartilage forms a very low friction, 2-4 mm thick layer that coats the bony surfaces. This allows the bones of the joint to glide over one another during movement. Osteoarthr­itis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of your bones wears down over time. www.bjc.sg for more informatio­n.
