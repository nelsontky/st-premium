    <p>“I don’t think I’m ex­ag­ger­at­ing when I say that po­etry has kept me sane dur­ing this time of im­mense pres­sure,” said for­mer United States poet lau­re­ate Tracy K. Smith.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in a vir­tual di­a­logue at the Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val last Satur­day, she said time has felt dif­fer­ent dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing at my cal­en­dar al­most gives me a panic at­tack. I can’t bear to see how much time has gone by. I feel that a veil has been pulled back on the cosmic re­al­ity of time.”</p>
    <p>This is where po­etry comes in, she added, be­cause it can ma­nip­u­late time. “Po­etry has al­ways been good at say­ing, ‘We must leap out of this mo­ment and into this other mo­ment. We’re do­ing a space-time trans­fer in this poem.’”</p>
    <p>Smith, 48, is one of two Pulitzer Prize-win­ning Amer­i­can poets head­lin­ing the fes­ti­val’s 23rd edi­tion, which is or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil and runs un­til Sun­day in its first fully dig­i­tal edi­tion with more than 200 pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The other is Sharon Olds, 77, whose work over decades has been lauded for its frank ex­plo­ration of the fe­male body and sex­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“All of my writ­ing is a re­sponse to si­lence about ev­ery­thing, which is the tra­di­tion I grew up in,” Olds told moder­a­tor Cyril Wong in a vir­tual di­a­logue last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Olds was raised in a strictly re­li­gious Calvin­ist house­hold and pub­lished her first col­lec­tion, Satan Says, when she was 37. “It was not the usual thing then to be so loud and mad.”</p>
    <p>Smith of­ten in­cor­po­rates si­lence into her work, some­times in the form of era­sure in po­ems like Dec­la­ra­tion, in which she blacks out parts of the United States Dec­la­ra­tion of In­de­pen­dence to draw at­ten­tion to how slav­ery is erased from the na­tion’s found­ing nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>“Much of what we take for granted is rid­dled with omis­sion and era­sures,” she told moder­a­tor Lawrence La­cam­bra Ypil. “Lis­ten­ing in the right way can help us un­der­stand why what is miss­ing has been re­moved.”</p>
    <p>Olds has writ­ten about child­hood abuse and di­vorce. Her Pulitzer Prize-win­ning col­lec­tion Stag’s Leap (2012) draws on how her hus­band left her after more than 30 years of mar­riage for another woman.</p>
    <p>In the past, she said, she would have been coy about whether the po­ems were au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal, in or­der to pro­tect her fam­ily and keep the fo­cus on her craft.</p>
    <p>“But then, as I got older, I re­alised it was im­por­tant for each of us to tell our truth, if we could, about how our po­ems are made, and I don’t see any dis­tance be­tween me and the speaker, ever.</p>
    <p>“Now, it’s very free­ing for me to be able to say that I’m try­ing to speak ab­so­lutely as my­self.”</p>
    <p>Smith’s po­ems strad­dle the in­ti­mate and the cosmic, as in her Pulitzer Prize-win­ning col­lec­tion Life On Mars (2011), which takes its ti­tle from her favourite David Bowie song and serves as an el­egy for her fa­ther, a sci­en­tist who worked on the Hub­ble tele­scope.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at things on a cosmic scale helps her make bet­ter sense of the set­backs that hu­man­ity keeps wit­ness­ing, she said.</p>
    <p>“I have come to un­der­stand that ev­ery move­ment for jus­tice, which I have al­ways thought of as dis­crete and dis­tinct with a be­gin­ning and an end, is ac­tu­ally just one sin­gle wave, the end of which is some­thing that might be so far off in the dis­tance as to not even con­cern us, even though we find our­selves par­tic­i­pat­ing.</p>
    <p>“We’re part of a move­ment for change that may re­sult in suc­cess only in a thou­sand years. But to me, we be­long to a sin­gle di­verse body with a uni­fied aim.”</p>
