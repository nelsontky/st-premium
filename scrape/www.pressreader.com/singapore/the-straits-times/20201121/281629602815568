    <p>The late Mr Lee Kuan Yew did not view his daugh­ter-in-law, se­nior lawyer Lee Suet Fern, as play­ing the role of his lawyer in the ex­e­cu­tion of his fi­nal will, ac­cord­ing to the high­est dis­ci­plinary body for the le­gal pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>A Court of Three Judges based its de­ci­sion on the le­gal prece­dent that a so­lic­i­tor-client re­la­tion­ship arises only when both par­ties mu­tu­ally in­tend to en­ter into one, or should rea­son­ably have un­der­stood that they were en­ter­ing into such a re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>This is so even if there is no for­mal doc­u­mented agree­ment be­tween them.</p>
    <p>But such an im­plied re­tainer sit­u­a­tion did not ex­ist in the case of Mr Lee’s last will, the court said in a writ­ten judg­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Given her ac­tions, Mrs Lee should have un­der­stood that she was act­ing as Mr Lee’s so­lic­i­tor in the prepa­ra­tion and ex­e­cu­tion of his last will.</p>
    <p>But the same could not be said of Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>The court there­fore ac­quit­ted Mrs Lee of charges of grossly im­proper con­duct in the dis­charge of her pro­fes­sional du­ties.</p>
    <p>The charges, brought against her by the Law So­ci­ety, had re­lied on there be­ing a so­lic­i­tor-client re­la­tion­ship be­tween her and Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>The court, how­ever, found Mrs Lee guilty of al­ter­na­tive charges of mis­con­duct un­be­fit­ting a so­lic­i­tor and ad­vo­cate – a charge that stands even if there is no im­plied re­tainer.</p>
    <p>She was thus given a 15-month sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>LEE KUAN YEW STILL CON­SID­ERED KWA KIM LI AS HIS LAWYER</p>
    <p>In its j udg­ment, the court said there was in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to con­clude that Mr Lee had con­sid­ered Mrs Lee his lawyer.</p>
    <p>It noted that he had ini­tially ex­pected his usual lawyer, Ms Kwa Kim Li, to at­tend to the ex­e­cu­tion of his last will.</p>
    <p>But he changed his mind be­cause his son Lee Hsien Yang, Mrs Lee’s hus­band, told him that Ms Kwa was un­con­tactable and ap­peared to be away, and that it was un­wise to wait for her re­turn be­fore ex­e­cut­ing the last will.</p>
    <p>The court said the el­der Mr Lee changed his po­si­tion as he be­lieved that the draft will was iden­ti­cal to his first will, and that all that re­mained to be done was for him to sign it be­fore two wit­nesses.</p>
    <p>“We do not think (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) ever ceased to re­gard Ms Kwa as his so­lic­i­tor, at least where mat­ters per­tain­ing to his es­tate were con­cerned, even though he, like Ms Kwa, was not fully ap­prised of the sit­u­a­tion,” the court ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“(Mr Lee Kuan Yew) pro­ceeded as he did essen­tially be­cause (Mr Lee Hsien Yang) had as­sured him that he could pro­ceed in that way, and that (Mrs Lee) would as­sist with only the ad­min­is­tra­tive task of find­ing wit­nesses for the ex­e­cu­tion of the last will.</p>
    <p>“While this was an inac­cu­rate por­trayal by (Mr Lee Hsien Yang), on the lim­ited ev­i­dence be­fore us, we think that (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) pro­ceeded as he did be­cause of the ad­vice of his son, and not be­cause he rea­son­ably re­garded (Mrs Lee) as his so­lic­i­tor for the prepa­ra­tion and ex­e­cu­tion of the last will.”</p>
    <p>The court thus found that Mr Lee Kuan Yew did not see Mrs Lee as his lawyer, pre­vent­ing a so­lic­i­tor­client re­la­tion­ship from aris­ing.</p>
    <p>‘IM­PLAU­SI­BLE’ FOR MRS LEE TO THINK NO IM­PLIED RE­TAINER</p>
    <p>Still, the court held that Mrs Lee should have un­der­stood her­self to have been act­ing as Mr Lee’s lawyer.</p>
    <p>It re­jected her ar­gu­ment that she, too, viewed her­self as merely as­sist­ing with the ad­min­is­tra­tive task of find­ing wit­nesses for the ex­e­cu­tion of the last will.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for its re­jec­tion is that Mrs Lee had put for­ward a draft of the last will as be­ing ready for ex­e­cu­tion and rep­re­sented this draft as the “orig­i­nal agreed will”, which the court said amounted to le­gal ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Hsien Yang later cut Ms Kwa out of the process by not in­clud­ing her in the e-mail thread in which he urged his fa­ther to pro­ceed with the ex­e­cu­tion with­out wait­ing for her.</p>
    <p>The court said Mrs Lee could not have ver­i­fied if the draft was iden­ti­cal to the first will, which she did not have a copy of. She also did not check with Ms Kwa if it was in fact the same will.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew had ear­lier in­di­cated his wish to re­vert to the first will he had signed on Aug 20, 2011, and he pro­ceeded to ex­e­cute the last will on the sole ba­sis that Mrs Lee had rep­re­sented it as be­ing iden­ti­cal to his first will.</p>
    <p>The court said: “(Mrs Lee’s) sub­se­quent fail­ure to qual­ify the cru­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tions which she had made in­di­cates that she knew, or must have known, that she was tak­ing on the role and re­spon­si­bil­ity of be­ing (Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s) so­lic­i­tor for the prepa­ra­tion and ex­e­cu­tion of the last will, at least to the lim­ited ex­tent of lo­cat­ing a copy of the ex­e­cuted ver­sion of the first will, check­ing the draft last will against it and en­sur­ing that the draft last will was ready for ex­e­cu­tion.”</p>
    <p>It later emerged there were dif­fer­ences be­tween the draft that be­came Mr Lee’s last will and the first will, which he in­tended to sign.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee also made ar­range­ments for the last will to be ex­e­cuted with her col­leagues as wit</p>
    <p>nesses, while per­son­ally mon­i­tor­ing the ar­range­ments closely.</p>
    <p>She saw to the safe­keep­ing of an orig­i­nal copy of the last will af­ter it was ex­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>When Mrs Lee sub­se­quently in­formed Ms Kwa of the ex­e­cu­tion of the last will, she did not alert Ms Kwa to the cir­cum­stances un­der which it had been ex­e­cuted, the court said.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, any cause for con­cern per­tain­ing to the ac­cu­racy of Mrs Lee’s rep­re­sen­ta­tions about the draft last will would not have been ev­i­dent to Ms Kwa.</p>
    <p>“View­ing all these mat­ters ob­jec­tively, we find it im­plau­si­ble that (Mrs Lee) could rea­son­ably think that there was no im­plied re­tainer be­tween (Mr Lee) and her,” the court said.</p>
