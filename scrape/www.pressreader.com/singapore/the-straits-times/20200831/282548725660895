    <p>Lo­cal model-ac­tress Sheila Sim showed off her baby bump in a pre­na­tal photo shoot.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old ac­tress who is cur­rently 34 weeks preg­nant with her first child – a daugh­ter – up­loaded sev­eral pho­tos from the shoot on her In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>In the pho­tos, Sim, who mar­ried her banker hus­band Deon Woo in 2018, is dressed in a fig­ure-hug­ging white body­suit .</p>
    <p>She wrote: “What was I think­ing when I ini­tially thought I didn’t want to do a pre­na­tal shoot?</p>
    <p>“I’m so glad I did, thanks to ev­ery­one who ad­vised me to do it, friends and strangers alike. It was a re­ally beau­ti­ful and joy­ful shoot cap­tur­ing this pre­cious mo­ment of my first preg­nancy.”</p>
    <p>She said she was shy dur­ing the pho­tog­ra­phy ses­sion as it was her first lin­gerie shoot and thanked the pho­tog­ra­pher for mak­ing her feel safe.</p>
    <p>She also thanked her hair and make-up artists for be­ing with her through her life’s “big­gest mile­stones”.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing her un­born child di­rectly in sub­se­quent posts and pho­tos, she wrote: “I loved you be­fore I met you. The last 34 weeks (were) magic.”</p>
    <p>Sim, who an­nounced her preg­nancy in April, told Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao then that she found out about her preg­nancy on her sec­ond wed­ding an­niver­sary dur­ing Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>Due for a cae­sarean birth in Oc­to­ber, the ac­tress is known for ap­pear­ances in Me­di­a­corp’s drama se­ries such as the di­alect se­ries Ho Seh Bo (How Are You, 2019) and long-run­ning drama fran­chise 118 (2014-2018).</p>
