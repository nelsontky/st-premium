    <p>South Kore­ans work­ing for the United States army here could be among the first to get in­oc­u­lated for Covid-19 as early as this week, while the rest of their coun­try­men fume over the gov­ern­ment’s de­lay in buy­ing vac­cines amid a re­lent­less third wave of in­fec­tions that has raised the to­tal fig­ure to over 58,000.</p>
    <p>“We can only envy Sin­ga­pore,” an ed­i­to­rial in JoongAng Ilbo news­pa­per lamented last week after the city state be­came the first in Asia to ap­prove and re­ceive the first batch of avail­able vac­cines by Amer­i­can drug­maker Pfizer and Ger­man biotech firm BioNTech.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s turn will come only in Fe­bru­ary or March when its first pur­chased vac­cines – from Bri­tish-Swedish drug­maker As­traZeneca – ar­rive.</p>
    <p>The de­lay has been blamed on the gov­ern­ment’s fail­ure to recog­nise the im­por­tance of se­cur­ing vac­cines early.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the health author­i­ties had man­aged to flat­ten the curve early on dur­ing the pan­demic, the gov­ern­ment saw no ur­gent need in ink­ing vac­cine deals with in­ter­na­tional drug­mak­ers and in­stead sup­ported do­mes­tic ef­forts to de­velop a “Korean cure”.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Choi Jae-wook of Korea Univer­sity’s Col­lege of</p>
    <p>Medicine said the gov­ern­ment mis­judged the sit­u­a­tion and did not lis­ten when med­i­cal ex­perts urged them to se­cure vac­cines early on.</p>
    <p>“Of course, it’s good to let Korean firms de­velop our own vac­cine but you have to make plans</p>
    <p>based on the real sit­u­a­tion,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>It was not un­til Oc­to­ber that South Korea made ad­vance pay­ment with Covax, the global vac­cine pro­ject, to se­cure 10 mil­lion vac­cine doses. Mean­while, vac</p>
    <p>cines from Pfizer and US biotech firm Moderna were rolled out in Bri­tain and the US this month.</p>
    <p>A batch ar­rived in South Korea last Fri­day for the US Forces Korea and the first shots were given to health­care work­ers and first re</p>
    <p>spon­ders yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As JoongAng Ilbo noted, the first avail­able vac­cines were all snapped up by the time South Korea de­cided to join the race. “Blind faith has led author­i­ties to ne­glect vac­cines,” the pa­per said.</p>
    <p>It was only un­der mount­ing pub­lic pres­sure that the gov­ern­ment re­port­edly scram­bled re­cently to fi­nalise deals with Pfizer, Moderna and Bel­gium-based Janssen to bring in more vac­cines from the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in has in­sisted that the gov­ern­ment is “pro­ceed­ing smoothly ac­cord­ing to our orig­i­nal plan”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters on Mon­day, he dis­missed crit­i­cism that the gov­ern­ment had fum­bled its vac­cine pro­cure­ment and said South Korea had se­cured enough doses for in­oc­u­la­tions to start in Fe­bru­ary, and is now buy­ing ad­di­tional sup­plies for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry had said on Dec 8 that it had se­cured early ac­cess to vac­cines for 44 mil­lion peo­ple, from Covax and four other drug­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of doses has since been in­creased to 56 mil­lion, with a Moderna deal to cover 20 mil­lion peo­ple sealed by Pres­i­dent Moon him­self on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic con­cern over vac­cines is grow­ing as in­fec­tion fig­ures show no sign of fall­ing de­spite tight­ened virus con­trol mea­sures such as ban­ning gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple.</p>
    <p>South Korea yes­ter­day re­ported 1,046 new cases, in­clud­ing 1,030 lo­cal in­fec­tions. This brought the to­tal to 58,725 – over­tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s fig­ure. A record 40 new fa­tal­i­ties raised the death toll to 859.</p>
    <p>On the same day, the gov­ern­ment also un­veiled a third round of eco­nomic relief mea­sures worth 9.3 tril­lion won (S$11.3 bil­lion) to help small busi­nesses forced to close, and free­lancers. Pay­outs will be­gin on Jan 11 and ben­e­fit 5.8 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Prof Choi of Korea Univer­sity said vac­cines could be the “game changer in a pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>“Once 20-25 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion is vac­ci­nated, you will see vis­i­ble ef­fects on the in­fec­tion rate and peo­ple will feel more com­fort­able and se­cure,” he said.</p>
    <p>“By next March, the in­fec­tion rate would have gone down in coun­tries that started vac­ci­na­tion early and they can start re­sum­ing nor­mal life, but Kore­ans will still have to wait. That’s why peo­ple are an­gry with the gov­ern­ment.”</p>
