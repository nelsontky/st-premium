    <p>The de­signs for the pre­vi­ous and cur­rent homes of this mar­ried cou­ple in their 40s are as dif­fer­ent as day and night.</p>
    <p>While their old home – a four-bed­room Hous­ing Board flat in Be­dok Reser­voir View – was colour­ful and vin­tage-in­spired, their new one sports a monochro­matic palette filled with clas­si­cally in­spired fea­tures.</p>
    <p>So dif­fer­ent were the styles that “even the table­ware we brought over from our old home did not match the decor in our cur­rent space”, quips the wife, a real es­tate agent.</p>
    <p>She and her hus­band, a project man­ager in the in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try, de­cided to go for a com­pletely dif­fer­ent look for their new 1,200 sq ft Hous­ing Board flat in Tampines, where they live with their 13-year-old son.</p>
    <p>What they did not change was the in­te­rior firm. For their new home, they again used home­grown in­te­rior con­sul­tancy</p>
    <p>Sponge.</p>
    <p>“It comes up with unique de­signs and is skilled in space plan­ning,” the wife ex­plains.</p>
    <p>Apart from com­mu­ni­cat­ing their de­sire for bright and mostly white in­te­ri­ors with a cre­ative twist and am­ple stor­age space, they gave in­te­rior de­signer J.T. carte blanche to in­ter­pret the brief.</p>
    <p>The three-month ren­o­va­tion cost $100,000 with­out fur­nish­ings.</p>
    <p>The long and an­gu­lar ceil­ing in the liv­ing room, wrapped i n be­spoke vinyl film with a geo­met­ric de­sign, is a stand­out de­sign fea­ture.</p>
    <p>To cre­ate a big­ger ser­vice bal­cony that is hid­den be­hind the wall of ven­ti­la­tion blocks, the kitchen took over the orig­i­nal din­ing space. The fam­ily dines next to the semi-open kitchen.</p>
    <p>The bed­room ad­ja­cent to the liv­ing room was con­verted into a study-cum-guest room. De­signed to be con­ducive to work, half walls made of glass and a glass door al­low nat­u­ral light to il­lu­mi­nate the pre­dom­i­nantly white space.</p>
    <p>J.T. says: “The key chal­lenge in this project was trans­form­ing a con­ven­tional HDB flat into a unique home. We did it by us­ing glass pan­els that al­low nat­u­ral light to fil­ter through from room to room.”</p>
    <p>Even the main door did not es­cape his eye. With its mar­ble-like de­cal to match the floor tiles, the ef­fect makes the foyer ap­pear grander.</p>
    <p>The mas­ter bed­room door, which used to open into the liv­ing room, was re­ori­ented to the side for greater pri­vacy. Clas­si­cally in­spired pan­elling on the wall and ceil­ing adds el­e­gance.</p>
    <p>Plenty of stor­age cab­i­nets have been built into the mas­ter bath­room, which is clad in monochro­matic graphic tiles to pro­vide vis­ual in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The son’s bed­room also sports a monochro­matic palette that is con­sis­tent with the rest of the house.</p>
