    <p>The phys­i­cal con­di­tion and men­tal health of some se­niors in nurs­ing homes had de­te­ri­o­rated and staff were work­ing longer hours while cop­ing with the stress of keep­ing up with fast-chang­ing govern­ment ad­vi­sories and rules amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>De­spite th­ese chal­lenges, the nurs­ing home sec­tor – with 80 homes and about 16,000 res­i­dents – was able to keep the num­ber of Covid-19 cases to 20 res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are among the find­ings in a re­port by man­age­ment con­sul­tancy Oliver Wy­man, based on in­ter­views con­ducted be­tween June and Au­gust with about 50 peo­ple, in­clud­ing long-term care op­er­a­tors, aca­demics, pol­i­cy­mak­ers, tech­nol­ogy providers and in­ter­na­tional ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The re­port, re­leased yes­ter­day, also found that in Sin­ga­pore, five staff from nurs­ing homes were in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The num­ber, the re­port said, is low com­pared with that in other coun­tries, where clus­ters in nurs­ing homes have spread quickly and led to many deaths.</p>
    <p>The re­port, a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Oliver Wy­man and lo­cal phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion Lien Foun­da­tion, also touched on the chal­lenges faced by long-term care op­er­a­tors, which in­clude nurs­ing homes, day­care cen­tres and home care ser­vices.</p>
    <p>It also pro­vided rec­om­men­da­tions on how the sec­tor can in­no­vate and de­velop be­yond the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Kitty Lee, part­ner and head of the health and life sci­ence prac­tice for the Asia-Pa­cific at Oliver Wy­man, said: “We want to raise the con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“There will never be progress or an im­pe­tus for some­thing dif­fer­ent if we don’t have a con­ver­sa­tion around what hap­pened and how we can make things bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Ms Radha Basu, re­search di­rec­tor at Lien Foun­da­tion, said that while the sec­tor did face chal­lenges due to un­prece­dented risks, in many cases it was dif­fi­cult to think of al­ter­na­tives for the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­port said nearly 100 up­dates were sent out by the au­thor­i­ties dur­ing the first six months of the cri­sis, and some op­er­a­tors said it was a strug­gle to cope with the short turn­around times.</p>
    <p>But op­er­a­tors also said there was suf­fi­cient sup­port from the Govern­ment, which lis­tened to feed­back and mod­i­fied poli­cies to adapt to chang­ing sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, nurs­ing home op­er­a­tors were scram­bling to pre­pare for vis­i­tors when it was an­nounced in June that vis­its could re­sume in two days.</p>
    <p>So the Min­istry of Health en­cour­aged fam­ily mem­bers to plan vis­its over sub­se­quent weeks, al­though many peo­ple rushed to book the first avail­able slots.</p>
    <p>An­other chal­lenge op­er­a­tors faced was the strain on staff, in a</p>
    <p>sec­tor where about 80 per cent of di­rect care staff are for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Some had their eight-hour shifts changed to 12-hour shifts, while about 3,600 res­i­dent-fac­ing staff – about 40 per cent of nurs­ing home staff – had their lives dis­rupted when they were moved to des­ig­nated on-site ac­com­mo­da­tion facil</p>
    <p>ities or ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Se­nior cit­i­zens also felt the im­pact of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Their emo­tional well-be­ing was af­fected with the many changes, and a pe­riod with­out vis­its from their loved ones led to dis­en­gage­ment and stress, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Sairam Azad, deputy di­rec­tor</p>
    <p>of health and se­nior care at so­cial ser­vice agency Awwa, said some clients had be­havioural and ad­just­ment is­sues when they could not go out dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, while oth­ers, such as those with de­men­tia, were re­luc­tant to wear masks.</p>
    <p>Some op­er­a­tors, es­pe­cially day­care cen­tres that had to be closed for some time, turned to on­line plat­forms to con­tinue en­gag­ing the se­niors, but with mixed suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The re­port said that while there was rea­son­able take-up of dig­i­tal ser­vices among less frail and younger se­niors, op­er­a­tors in the study found that this trans­lated to only be­tween 20 per cent and 50 per cent of se­niors reg­u­larly en­gag­ing in vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the pan­demic has also been a cat­a­lyst for more peo­ple to adopt home-based care, as well as tech­nol­ogy such as tele­health ser­vices.</p>
    <p>De­mand for home nurs­ing ser­vices saw an in­crease of up to 20 per cent, op­er­a­tors said, while there was a 25 per cent to 50 per cent rise in de­mand for home med­i­cal care.</p>
    <p>The re­port rec­om­mended that op­er­a­tors put more fo­cus on digi</p>
    <p>tal-led mod­els, as tech­nolo­gies such as tele­health are here to stay.</p>
    <p>Awwa is one op­er­a­tor look­ing into pro­vid­ing more tele­health ser­vices. It is also de­vel­op­ing a com­mu­ni­ca­tion app where staff can dis­cuss with clients and their fam­i­lies about care plans, home ex­er­cise pro­grammes and other mat­ters through one chan­nel, said Mr Sairam.</p>
    <p>The re­port also called for a re­newed fo­cus on pre­ven­tive health and well­ness, as well as adop­tion of tech­nolo­gies such as re­mote mon­i­tor­ing.</p>
    <p>It added that the men­tal health and well-be­ing of se­niors must be in­cluded in over­all care plan­ning, and the well-be­ing of staff also has to be pri­ori­tised.</p>
    <p>Care­givers also need more sup­port, it said.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Basu: “We hope some of the tech­nol­ogy and other op­por­tu­ni­ties high­lighted in the re­port can pave the way for a stronger, more re­silient and in­te­grated sec­tor that is bet­ter able to bal­ance safety with well-be­ing dur­ing this pan­demic and be­yond.”</p>
