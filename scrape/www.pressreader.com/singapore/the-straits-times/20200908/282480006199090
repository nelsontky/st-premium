    <p>NEW YORK • Its au­tumn sea­son has been can­celled and its con­cert hall closed in­def­i­nitely, so New York’s Philharmon­ic is tak­ing it to the streets.</p>
    <p>One of the United States’ old­est mu­si­cal i nsti­tu­tions, the famed sym­phony orches­tra is play­ing out­door pop-up shows, get­ting cre­ative dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has kept con­cert halls closed and New York­ers starved for live mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Each week­end, small en­sem­bles play at sur­prise lo­ca­tions through­out the city, wear­ing T-shirts and masks in front of a pickup truck dubbed the “band­wagon”.</p>
    <p>Some­times mu­si­cians get rained on or peo­ple just walk on by – but some­times a nearby de­liv­ery truck honks along in ex­actly the right key.</p>
    <p>In those mo­ments, says opera singer and se­ries pro­ducer An­thony Roth Costanzo, “it feels like the city is our orches­tra and we’re the soloists”.</p>
    <p>“In this mo­ment of pan­demic, in this mo­ment of so­cial change, we’re ex­plor­ing new ways to­gether... to con­nect to peo­ple and to re­alise that we have to rein­vent the con­cert-go­ing rit­ual,” the coun­tertenor said af­ter per­form­ing a set in Brook­lyn’s Betty Carter Park, a small leafy ur­ban oa­sis above a sub­way track.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just about bring­ing peo­ple into our house. It’s about get­ting our house out in the world, and shar­ing what mu­sic can do.”</p>
    <p>On a balmy Fri­day evening,</p>
    <p>Costanzo and a string duet – Quan Ge on vi­o­lin and Cong Wu on vi­ola – drew a so­cially dis­tanced crowd to their show that be­gan with Mozart’s Al­le­gro In G Ma­jor and wrapped with the clas­sic New York bal­lad Some­where from the mu­si­cal West Side Story.</p>
    <p>Un­like at its tra­di­tional clas­si­cal mu­sic con­certs, the Philharmon­ic en­cour­ages its pop-up au­di­ences to dance, ap­plaud and in­ter­act be­tween songs.</p>
    <p>Costanzo played the role of em­cee, speak­ing to the crowd be­tween each song from the bed of the pickup, at one point giv­ing a shoutout to the ven­dor selling sheets and tow­els next to the makeshift stage.</p>
    <p>Driv­ers slowed to roll down their win­dows and pedes­tri­ans took cell phone videos, as dozens of au­di­ence mem­bers – in­clud­ing chil­dren and dogs – stopped to take in the tunes that fea­tured a string ar­range­ment of singer Ali­cia Keys’ Em­pire State Of Mind.</p>
    <p>“I love you”, ap­plauded one onlooker, Lorri, whose eyes welled with tears as Costanzo fin­ished a mov­ing ren­di­tion of the som­bre Lachri­mae Pa­vane.</p>
    <p>“It touched me,” Lorri said after­wards, calling the sur­prise con­cert “heaven-sent”.</p>
    <p>Like many mu­si­cians, mem­bers of the Philharmon­ic took their shows on­line when the spread of Covid-19 shut their doors in March.</p>
    <p>And while vir­tual con­certs of­fered a stop-gap so­lu­tion, they are sim­ply “not the same”, said Cong.</p>
    <p>“Mu­sic is about com­mu­ni­ca­tion,” he said. “We need the stage.”</p>
    <p>Out­doors, he con­tin­ued, “it’s nice to feel the en­ergy from peo­ple – we play, we share the en­ergy, and we have en­ergy back from the au­di­ence”.</p>
    <p>The Philharmon­ic is not pub­licly an­nounc­ing when and where each con­cert will oc­cur, to avoid large crowds from amass­ing.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion is plan­ning three per­for­mances a day on Fri­days, Satur­days and Sun­days into at least mid­dle of next month, aim­ing to even­tu­ally cover all five city bor­oughs.</p>
    <p>In each au­di­ence is the co-pres­i­dent of the League of Women Vot­ers, who acts as a groupie of sorts, fol­low­ing the per­form­ers and help­ing those gath­er­ing to regis­ter to vote.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Fri­day evening’s mini con­cert wrapped at the park, where Brook­lyn’s Academy of Mu­sic tow­ers across the street, Costanzo called it “grat­i­fy­ing” to be back out per­form­ing live.</p>
    <p>“There was a mo­ment at the end when the vi­o­lins fin­ished play­ing, and there was a per­fect still­ness, si­lence like you’d have in a con­cert hall,” he said. “I can feel peo­ple con­nect­ing – it’s not just me to them and them to me – it’s them to each other as well.</p>
    <p>“That’s so im­por­tant in our world right now,” he added.</p>
