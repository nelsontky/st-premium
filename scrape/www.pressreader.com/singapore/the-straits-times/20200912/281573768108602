    <p>The Tay­can 4S (be­low) is so sturdy, sure-footed and well-bal­anced that you can launch it with nary a care, even in the wet. With a mo­tor at each axle, and the elec­tronic magic which makes them work in per­fect har­mony, the bat­tery-pow­ered Porsche is an un­shake­able all-wheel-drive. LIFE</p>
    <p>Hav­ing driven the 2.8-sec­ond Tay­can Turbo S in Aus­tria last year, I would think the Tay­can 4S – with a rel­a­tively mod­est cen­tury sprint tim­ing of four sec­onds – would ap­pear mild.</p>
    <p>I was wrong.</p>
    <p>The 4S, al­though not as gid­dy­ing as the Turbo S or Turbo, is still stu­pen­dously quick on Sin­ga­pore roads. And you do not even have to drive it in Sport Plus mode.</p>
    <p>Even in Range – the meek­est mode which pre­serves bat­tery power – the car will out­sprint most four-wheel­ers, and many twowheel­ers.</p>
    <p>The Tay­can is so sturdy, sure­footed and well-bal­anced that you can launch it with nary a care, even in the wet.</p>
    <p>With a mo­tor at each axle and the elec­tronic magic which makes them work in per­fect har­mony, the bat­tery-pow­ered Porsche is an un­shake­able all-wheel-drive. Yet, it of­fers spon­tane­ity and fri­vol­ity – traits which some­times es­cape four-wheel-drive cars.</p>
    <p>Much of the credit has to do with the lin­ear­ity of elec­tric drive and the Tay­can’s gen­er­ous out­put of 390kW and 640Nm. While not as in­sane as the Turbo S’ 560kW and 1,050Nm, it is still pretty tor­ren­tial, and more than enough on most oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>In fact, the out­put is de­liv­ered so seam­lessly that the car ap­pears quicker than its specs sug­gest. Blast­ing off un­re­servedly from the lights in Sport Plus, t he Tay­can 4S breaches 70kmh be­fore it clears the junc­tion, con­vinc­ing you that it would be quite ca­pa­ble of reach­ing 100kmh well within four sec­onds.</p>
    <p>At the next junc­tion, you steel your­self for the bal­lis­tic en­deav­our, push­ing your but­tocks into the cusp of the semi-bucket seat and grip­ping the suede-lined steer­ing wheel hard. Lights turn, and you floor it.</p>
    <p>Again, it is an ef­fort­less launch, with not a hint of ner­vous­ness at the helm. With­out any drama, the car hur­tles for­ward to fill a mo­men­tary ex­panse of empti­ness all too soon.</p>
    <p>In those fleet­ing sec­onds, you get a glimpse of the fu­ture as the Tay­can’s soft hum turns into a shrill pulse evok­ing warp speed, Knight Rider and Anakin Sky­walker’s racing pod.</p>
    <p>For a four-door with a gen­er­ous 2.9m wheel­base, the car is en­ter­tain­ing and ca­pa­ble enough when ne­go­ti­at­ing twists and turns, even if I pre­fer a slightly dif­fer­ent blend of ride and han­dling. For in­stance, a more pli­ant ride and a heftier steer­ing.</p>
    <p>But as it is, the car is still eas­ily the most en­gag­ing elec­tric car I have driven so far.</p>
    <p>The Tay­can’s cabin is not as spa­cious as the Porsche Panam­era’s, but the car is not as un­wieldy in tight places such as old mul­ti­storey carparks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, you have to bear in mind its low front clear­ance, which can be over­come by lift­ing the car (there are three ride heights) or crawl­ing.</p>
    <p>Driven mostly in Range mode, which proves to be ad­e­quate in all sit­u­a­tions, the test-car av­er­aged just un­der 22kWh/100km – sig­nif­i­cantly lower than the stated 26.2kWh. Af­ter clock­ing 200km, it still had 195km of range.</p>
    <p>This may have to do with the Tay­can’s ex­cel­lent coast­ing abil­ity, which is great for high­ways and open roads. For stop-go city driv­ing, se­lect­ing Auto re­cu­per­a­tion al­lows you to drive more ef­fi­ciently as the car will go into power gen­er­a­tion if it senses a ve­hi­cle in front. One-pedal driv­ing is thus pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The Tay­can is also an ex­tremely well-built car – and not just in re­la­tion to other Porsches.</p>
    <p>But most im­pres­sively, it is an emo­tive elec­tric car, bring­ing hope to those who fear a world of sani­tised, ho­mo­ge­neous ve­hi­cles when the com­bus­tion en­gine goes the way of the dodo.</p>
