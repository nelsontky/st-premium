    <p>When Mr Lamin Ngobeh, a high school teacher, saw a so­cial me­dia post last month about work­ing re­motely in Bar­ba­dos for 12 months, his in­ter­est was piqued.</p>
    <p>“My school prob­a­bly won’t open for in-per­son classes un­til at least Fe­bru­ary 2021, and I want to be in a coun­try that’s safer – health-wise – and also en­joy the qual­ity of life,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I reached out to my school lead­ers and they were very sup­port­ive of my de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>When it an­nounced its 12-month Wel­come Stamp pro­gramme in the mid­dle of last month, Bar­ba­dos be­came one of the first of sev­eral coun­tries, in re­gions from the Caribbean to East­ern Europe, to cre­ate pro­grammes for re­mote work­ers.</p>
    <p>They em­ploy ei­ther spe­cial visas or ex­pand ex­ist­ing ones to en­tice work­ers to tem­po­rar­ily re­lo­cate.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries of­fer­ing sim­i­lar visas cur­rently in­clude Es­to­nia, Ge­or­gia and Ber­muda.</p>
    <p>A sub­stan­tial drop in these coun­tries’ tourism num­bers is a key rea­son for the new pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Bar­ba­dos has re­ceived more than 1,000 ap­pli­ca­tions from around the world within the first week, with the ma­jor­ity of re­sponses from the United States, Canada and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>CATER­ING TO THE DIG­I­TAL NO­MAD</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the pan­demic, the num­ber of re­mote work­ers world­wide was growing.</p>
    <p>More than 7.3 mil­lion work­ers in the US de­scribed them­selves last year as “dig­i­tal no­mads” – those who choose to em­brace a lo­ca­tionin­de­pen­dent lifestyle that al­lows them to travel and work re­motely.</p>
    <p>Many work­ers are drawn to the lifestyle of dig­i­tal no­mads be­cause of a lower cost of liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Mag­gie Tu­ran­sky cur­rently lives in the Repub­lic of Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>She runs a web­site, The World Was Here First, with her part­ner, and rents a brand-new apart­ment in Tbil­isi for about US$500 (S$680) a month. They stayed there dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I can’t think of any other ma­jor city in a Western coun­try that would be com­pa­ra­ble,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The util­i­ties on top of that rarely go above US$50 a month, and the Wi-Fi is great.</p>
    <p>“Ge­or­gia is ap­peal­ing and there’s so much to see and do, and we kind of fell in love with it.”</p>
    <p>Ms Amanda Kol­bye cur­rently works from Malaysia as an on­line busi­ness coach.</p>
    <p>She has en­joyed liv­ing and work­ing over­seas for the past two years, liv­ing in places like Thai­land, Viet­nam, In­done­sia, Qatar and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“I’m con­sid­er­ing run­ning my busi­ness in an­other coun­try, like Es­to­nia or Bar­ba­dos or Ber­muda, that will al­low me to be closer to home,” she said.</p>
    <p>CRI­TE­RIA FOR EX­TENDED STAYS</p>
    <p>Some cri­te­ria for in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors who seek these ex­tended stays are sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>While all coun­tries re­quire proof of health in­surance and neg­a­tive virus tests (ei­ther pre-ar­rival, upon ar­rival, or both), some re­quire an ap­pli­ca­tion fee and proof of a monthly salary, com­plete with bank state­ments.</p>
    <p>For Bar­ba­dos, prospec­tive re­mote work­ers need to fill out an on­line ap­pli­ca­tion form and sub­mit pho­tos.</p>
    <p>They also need to sup­ply proof of em­ploy­ment and an in­come dec­la­ra­tion of at least US$50,000 an­nu­ally dur­ing the pe­riod they are on the is­land.</p>
    <p>An ap­pli­ca­tion fee of US$2,000 per per­son is payable af­ter ap­proval. Fam­i­lies pay a fee of US$3,000, ir­re­spec­tive of the num­ber of mem­bers in their house­hold.</p>
    <p>Ber­muda’s Res­i­dency Cer­tifi­cate Pol­icy, which was an­nounced on Aug 1, has an ap­pli­ca­tion fee of US$263. Un­like Bar­ba­dos, Ber­muda does not re­quire a min­i­mum monthly in­come for ex­tended stay re­mote work­ers.</p>
    <p>Es­to­nia’s new dig­i­tal no­mad visa, which be­gan on Aug 1 and is an ex­ten­sion of its e-Res­i­dency pro­gramme, will al­low vis­i­tors to stay in the coun­try legally and work re­motely for their em­ployer for up to 12 months.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion fee is US$125, and ap­pli­cants need to demon­strate proof of a base salary of at least US$4,150 a month.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia’s pro­gramme, called Re­motely from Ge­or­gia, al­lows work­ers to stay and work there for up to six months.</p>
    <p>Like Ber­muda, Ge­or­gia cur­rently does not re­quire ap­ply­ing work­ers to show a monthly min­i­mum in­come, but they need to make the case that t hey have suf­fi­cient means to sup­port their life­styles.</p>
    <p>IT MAY NOT BE FOR EVERY­ONE</p>
    <p>Mr Neville Mehra left his last cor­po­rate job in 2017 and has since done re­mote dig­i­tal strat­egy work through his com­pany, Nam­pora.</p>
    <p>He cur­rently lives and works in Va­len­cia, Spain, though he has worked in more than 50 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Ge­or­gia, and plans to re­turn.</p>
    <p>“Over time, free­lance dig­i­tal no­mads have started to ask what’s the best qual­ity of life, in­stead of ‘where are the jobs?’” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is not about mov­ing to a coun­try and tak­ing a job away from a lo­cal, but about spend­ing lo­cally at a higher level with a stronger cur­rency.”</p>
    <p>But while work­ing re­motely may be at­trac­tive to those who are able do their work with a lap­top and a zippy In­ter­net con­nec­tion, it may not be as easy for all pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing and work­ing re­motely in an­other coun­try will carry some risks.</p>
    <p>Lan­guage can also be a bar­rier. Those with chil­dren could have ad­di­tional headaches.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies who plan on school­ing their chil­dren from an­other coun­try re­motely may ex­pe­ri­ence is­sues with time-zone dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Those who would like to en­rol their chil­dren in lo­cal schools may also face lim­i­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>BEST QUAL­ITY OF LIFE</p>
    <p>Over time, free­lance dig­i­tal no­mads have started to ask what’s the best qual­ity of life, in­stead of ‘where are the jobs?’... This is not about mov­ing to a coun­try and tak­ing a job away from a lo­cal, but about spend­ing lo­cally at a higher level with a stronger cur­rency.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
