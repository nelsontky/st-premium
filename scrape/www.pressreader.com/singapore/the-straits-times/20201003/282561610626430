    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s mu­ral and street artists can be found perched on scaf­fold­ing or armed with spray guns loaded with tear-in­duc­ing all-weather paint, but they are not com­plain­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, it is all in a day’s work and they are happy they get to leave their larger-than-life mark. Here are some names in lo­cal street art.</p>
    <p>SYCO, 39</p>
    <p>Marine coat­ing in­spec­tor Fad­zli Aris, also known as Syco, is a man of few words, pre­fer­ring to let his out­size graf­fiti art (above) do the talk­ing in­stead.</p>
    <p>The self-taught artist says he is ex­cited about the grow­ing ac­cep­tance of street art, with pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor syn­er­gies fa­cil­i­tat­ing more cre­ative op­por­tu­ni­ties for up-and-com­ing artists.</p>
    <p>“All the mu­rals I have com­pleted are spe­cial,” says Syco. “But my most mem­o­rable was for Sin­ga­pore LNG, which was a large-scale com­mer­cial art­work.”</p>
    <p>He charges be­tween $500 and $2,500 for res­i­den­tial work and $1,000 and $50,000 for com­mer­cial com­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Info: Go to str.sg/JBH5 and www.face­book.com/SYCO03</p>
    <p>SLACSATU, 40</p>
    <p>The full-time graf­fiti and mu­ral artist will not re­veal his real name for art’s sake.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing up, I was al­ways called a slacker by my teacher, so I guess the name stuck,” says the af­fa­ble artist over the tele­phone, punc­tu­at­ing his sen­tences with chuck­les.</p>
    <p>What started out as a hobby af­ter he won his first graf­fiti com­pe­ti­tion in 2001 has turned into a vi­able business for the Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts dropout. “I felt graf­fiti was more my style in­stead of brushes and pa­per. Give me an aerosol spray any time.”</p>
    <p>In 2011, he opened The Black­book stu­dio in Kam­pong Glam with a few friends of the col­lec­tive ZNC, which has been keep­ing the scene alive with wall art (above), work­shops and graf­fiti jams along­side many other artists.</p>
    <p>He charges from $1,500 for a com­mis­sion and has been work­ing mainly on restau­rant projects.</p>

    <p>MISHELL LEONG, 41</p>
    <p>“Life ex­pres­sion­ist” is how Leong would like to be known, which she says best de­scribes her work.</p>
    <p>Most of her fine art paint­ings (left and far left) are pri­vately com­mis­sioned or bought by in­ter­na­tional pri­vate col­lec­tors in Switzer­land, Aus­tria, London, New York, Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She has also ex­hib­ited and sold her works in Hong Kong at the Asia Con­tem­po­rary Art Show last year, as well as at the Af­ford­able Art Fair Sin­ga­pore in 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>She is cur­rently work­ing on a life-size mu­ral at re­tail space Big Blue Trunk in Cluny Court, which of­fers An­nie Sloan Chalk Paint for</p>
    <p>DIY in­te­rior projects and work­shops.</p>
    <p>Leong, whose de­sign is in­spired by women’s em­pow­er­ment, says:</p>
    <p>“The mu­ral will be ‘bold, strong and fem­i­nine’, en­cour­ag­ing all of us to em­brace life boldly, be strong and free.”</p>
    <p>The work is ex­pected to be com­pleted by Oct 10.</p>
    <p>Info: Leong has a home gallery at 334 Lau­rel Wood Av­enue.</p>
    <p>Her works are also avail­able for pur­chase on­line.</p>
