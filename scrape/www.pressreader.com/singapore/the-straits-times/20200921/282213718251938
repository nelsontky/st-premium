    <p>Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Cheng Choon Fei called for a ban on com­muters play­ing re­li­gious mu­sic out loud on MRT trains and buses on their per­sonal elec­tronic de­vices (Lis­ten to re­li­gious mu­sic on trains, buses in pri­vate, Sept 18),</p>
    <p>I un­der­stand his con­cerns. How­ever, there are al­ready laws in place against mak­ing ex­ces­sive noise on pub­lic trans­port. For ex­am­ple, Sec­tion 14 of the Mis­cel­la­neous Of­fences (Pub­lic Or­der and Nui­sance) Act pro­hibits the mak­ing of noise in such a man­ner as to cause or be likely to cause an­noy­ance or in­con­ve­nience to the oc­cu­pier of any premises in the vicin­ity or to any per­son law­fully us­ing any pub­lic road or in any pub­lic place.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tion 17 of the Rapid</p>
    <p>Tran­sit Sys­tems Reg­u­la­tions also pro­vides: “No per­son shall con­duct him­self on any train or in any part of the rail­way premises so as to cause a nui­sance or an­noy­ance to other pas­sen­gers.”</p>
    <p>On the other hand, a ban specif­i­cally tar­geted at the play­ing of re­li­gious mu­sic on pub­lic trans­port may amount to un­law­ful dis­crim­i­na­tion against re­li­gion or the re­li­gious, vi­o­lat­ing the right to non-dis­crim­i­na­tion and re­li­gious free­dom un­der Ar­ti­cles 12 and 15 of the Sin­ga­pore Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>I once took a taxi in which Bud­dhist chants were be­ing played on the au­dio player. The driver asked if I was all right with the play­ing of chants and was pre­pared to turn them off if I was un­com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>When I replied that I had no is­sues with it, a mean­ing­ful di­a­logue that lasted the rest of the jour­ney en­sued, where I shared my per­spec­tives as a Chris­tian while he shared his Bud­dhist per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>While the con­text of my ex­pe­ri­ence with the taxi driver is dif­fer­ent, the same les­sons of mu­tual re­spect, ac­com­mo­da­tion and un­der­stand­ing ap­ply.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a mul­tira­cial and multi-re­li­gious so­ci­ety where peo­ple of dif­fer­ent races and creeds co­ex­ist. With an at­ti­tude of re­straint on the one hand and tol­er­ance on the other, we can help to ex­pand the com­mon space for all in so­ci­ety.</p>
