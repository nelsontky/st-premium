    <p>A teacher who per­formed in­de­cent acts on two 15-year-old girls in sep­a­rate in­ci­dents was sen­tenced on Thurs­day to four years’ jail.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean of­fender who is now 33 had pleaded guilty on Tues­day to two counts of per­form­ing an in­de­cent act on a mi­nor and one count of sex­u­ally pen­e­trat­ing an un­der­age girl. All three charges in­volved a girl he tar­geted in 2017.</p>
    <p>Three other charges, in­clud­ing those in­volv­ing an­other girl in 2015, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The man left the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion in Septem­ber 2018 amid a po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion. While de­tails about the man and the school can­not be re­vealed due to a gag or­der, it was said in court that the sec­ond vic­tim suf­fered psy­cho­log­i­cally due to his ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused’s ac­tions made her feel that she could not trust peo­ple that she just met with. She felt that she should not go to school, in or­der to avoid the ac­cused,” Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor James Chew had said in ear­lier pro­ceed­ings. “She felt scared when she saw peo­ple wait­ing at the void deck and, at times, had flash­backs of the in­ci­dent.”</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent hap­pened on Feb 25, 2017. The ac­cused had sent the girl a text mes­sage, ask­ing if she wanted to meet him for a ride in his car. She agreed and he told her not to tell any­one about their out­ing.</p>
    <p>After pick­ing her up, he parked the ve­hi­cle near Block 374 Tampines Street 34 and pro­ceeded to touch her in­ap­pro­pri­ately. When the girl thwarted his ad­vances, he drove her home. She then blocked him on the var­i­ous apps that they had used to com­mu­ni­cate with each other, be­fore telling her close friends about the in­ci­dent two days later.</p>
    <p>The girl, who at­tended the same school he taught in, stopped at­tend­ing classes soon after, prompt­ing school staff to visit her home on March 2 that year. A po­lice re­port was made later that day.</p>
    <p>The man’s ex­ploita­tion of the girls started in 2015, with him show­ing the first vic­tim a video of a woman per­form­ing a sex­ual act. Later that year, he touched her in­ap­pro­pri­ately.</p>
    <p>His bail was set at $15,000 on Thurs­day. He will sur­ren­der him­self on Nov 30 to be­gin serv­ing his jail term. For sex­u­ally pen­e­trat­ing a mi­nor, an of­fender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.</p>
