    <p>TE­HERAN • Iran’s Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Guards blasted a mock-up of an Amer­i­can air­craft car­rier with mis­siles yes­ter­day dur­ing mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in sen­si­tive Gulf waters, state tele­vi­sion said.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cises – dubbed “Prophet Mo­hammed 14th” – were held near the Strait of Hor­muz, a vi­tal ship­ping lane for a fifth of global oil out­put.</p>
    <p>They were staged at a time of height­ened ten­sions between Iran and its decades-old arch en­emy, the United States.</p>
    <p>Footage of the war games broad­cast on state tele­vi­sion showed the Guards’ air and naval forces ready­ing for an at­tack off the coun­try’s south-west coast.</p>
    <p>Speed­boats skimmed across the wa­ter in for­ma­tion be­fore ground forces fired can­non and a mis­sile was launched from a he­li­copter.</p>
    <p>The mock-up of a Nimitz-class air­craft car­rier came into view with rows of dummy fighter jets on ei­ther side of its land­ing strip.</p>
    <p>The tele­vi­sion then cut to rock­ets be­ing fired out to sea from the backs of trucks, be­fore show­ing dam­age to the hull of the mock-up air­craft car­rier.</p>
    <p>An­other mis­sile fired from a he­li­copter left a trail of smoke be­fore ap­pear­ing to smash into the side of the fake war­ship.</p>
    <p>Armed forces were then seen rap­pelling onto the deck of the ves­sel, be­fore around a dozen speed­boats cir­cle around it.</p>
    <p>“What was shown to­day in th­ese ex­er­cises, at the level of aerospace and naval forces, was all of­fen­sive,” Guards com­man­der Ma­jor-Gen­eral Hos­sein Salami told state tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The war games come only days af­ter Te­heran ac­cused US fighter jets of ha­rass­ing an Ira­nian com­mer­cial air­liner in the skies over Syria.</p>
    <p>At least four pas­sen­gers on board the Ma­han Air plane were in­jured in last Thurs­day’s in­ci­dent, af­ter the pi­lot took emer­gency ac­tion to avoid the war­planes.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have es­ca­lated between Iran and the US since Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump uni­lat­er­ally with­drew from a land­mark nu­clear agree­ment in 2018.</p>
    <p>The arch foes have come to the brink of war twice since June last year, when the Guards shot down a US drone in the Gulf.</p>
    <p>Their an­i­mos­ity deep­ened af­ter Iran’s most prom­i­nent gen­eral Qasem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike near Bagh­dad air­port in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>One of the most re­cent con­fronta­tions was in mid-April, when the US ac­cused the Guards of us­ing speed­boats to ha­rass its war­ships in the Gulf.</p>
