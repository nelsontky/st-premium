    <p>The Mid­dle East firm lead­ing the way to mount a res­cue deal for Hyflux wants a vir­tual town hall to be held next week for in­vestors hold­ing the trou­bled wa­ter firm’s per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares (PnP).</p>
    <p>Utico said yes­ter­day it would “once again like to reaf­firm” its of­fer for Hyflux as the com­pany and the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias, were still “non-com­mit­tal”.</p>
    <p>“We re­main avail­able for en­gage­ment with PnP hold­ers for a vir­tual town hall be­tween Oct 7 and Oct 10 to en­sure they are con­vinced and ap­prove of our of­fer,” the util­ity firm added.</p>
    <p>Last month, Utico again ex­tended the dead­line for Hyflux to ac­cept the res­cue pack­age – from Aug 30 to Oct 15. Yes­ter­day, it said the of­fers from other po­ten­tial Hyflux in­vestors – Aqua Munda and Pi­son In­vest­ments – ap­pear to have ex­pired.</p>
    <p>The dead­line for se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors to of­fer their debts to Pi­son was Aug 17. Pi­son then had un­til Sept 25 to ac­cept these of­fers, The Busi­ness Times re­ported in July. The long-stop date on the deal is Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Pi­son last month said it had re­ceived 158 ten­der ap­pli­ca­tion forms from note­hold­ers and other el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors, but that its ef­forts to en­gage with the un­se­cured work­ing group of seven banks had failed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Aqua Munda en­tered the pic­ture with its debt of­fer last De­cem­ber and in Fe­bru­ary ex­tended the long-stop date to July 17. It then said in June that it was pre­pared to make an of­fer to the PnP hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Utico man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Richard Menezes sent a let­ter to Hyflux on Wed­nes­day, ask­ing it to con­firm t hat both Aqua Munda’s and Pi­son’s of­fers had ex­pired and were not re­newed.</p>
    <p>In the let­ter, which was for­warded to the me­dia, Mr Menezes said Utico’s ear­lier re­quest for Hyflux to so­licit a re­sponse from the PnP hold­ers, through Sias, “to un­der­stand their amenabil­ity for a cash of­fer (al­beit at a re­duced level)”, had been based on pub­lic an­nounce­ments to other po­ten­tial white knights.</p>
    <p>“We seek your feed­back on the fore­go­ing and do not sub­scribe to the view that this may lead to mis­un­der­stand­ing or con­fu­sion,” he wrote.</p>
