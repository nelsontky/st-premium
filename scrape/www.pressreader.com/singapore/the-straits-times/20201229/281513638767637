    <p>Sin­ga­pore cau­tiously en­tered phase three of its re­open­ing yes­ter­day, with most peo­ple not will­ing to ex­plore the new bound­aries that al­low larger groups to dine to­gether and meet so­cially.</p>
    <p>In­stead, pa­trons re­mained watchful and stuck to small groups for their meals at hawker cen­tres in Ghim Moh and Toa Payoh, while dili­gently ob­serv­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in malls such as Junc­tion 8 in Bis­han.</p>
    <p>Groups of up to eight peo­ple can now gather so­cially, up from the pre­vi­ous limit of five, while house­holds can also re­ceive up to eight vis­i­tors at any one time.</p>
    <p>The move to phase three comes as Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to keep its num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases low, with only five new cases re­ported yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing one in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>More than 70 per cent of lo­cal res­i­dents are also on TraceTo­gether, the na­tional con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other na­tions, mean­while, have seen a re­cent spike in cases.</p>
    <p>The need for vig­i­lance re­mains as strong as ever, stressed Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said that around the world, ex­perts are warning about a post-sea­sonal surge in cases, as peo­ple ig­nore re­stric­tions and gather for fes­tive cel­e­bra­tions. This can­not be al­lowed to hap­pen here, said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He added that the new and more in­fec­tious strain of Covid-19 from the United King­dom also sig­nals the need for con­tin­ued vig­i­lance. “Please re­mem­ber: There are still rules in phase three. So com­ply with the mea­sures and do not let your guard down.”</p>
    <p>Un­der phase three, the ca­pac­ity lim­its for malls and large stand­alone stores have been in­creased, and at­trac­tions can ap­ply to raise their op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity from 50 per cent to 65 per cent.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions on reli­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions have been re­laxed, and up to 250 peo­ple are now al­lowed at wor­ship ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there were few groups of more than five peo­ple at the Ghim Moh Market and Food Cen­tre dur­ing lunchtime yes­ter­day, though fresh seat mark­ings sig­nalled that groups of up to eight could sit to­gether.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said yes­ter­day that, in gen­eral, ta­bles with eight seats or fewer will no longer have any seat mark­ings, while ta­bles with more than eight seats will have some seats marked out to en­sure that din­ing groups re­main lim­ited to a max­i­mum of eight peo­ple.</p>
    <p>NEA added that din­ing groups at hawker cen­tres will still have to keep 1m from one an­other. Where ad­ja­cent ta­bles are less than 1m apart, some seats may be marked out to main­tain safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>From next Mon­day, NEA said, it will also be re­mov­ing ac­cess con­trol mea­sures at seven mar­kets here that were in­tro­duced to en­sure ef­fec­tive safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a ca­pac­ity curb on ve­hi­cles fer­ry­ing work­ers was also lifted, and com­pa­nies now no longer need to re­duce the max­i­mum pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity of these ve­hi­cles by 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses have been pre­par­ing for phase three as well. A spokesman for Five Tapas bar in Cup­page near Or­chard Road said that he and his staff have moved around ta­bles to pre­pare for groups of eight who have made reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, civil ser­vant Ben­jamin Seah, 55, ad­vo­cated cau­tion. “I think Sin­ga­pore has done very well but if a sec­ond wave hap­pens like in Korea, which I think is in­evitable, we should be flex­i­ble and ready to go back into phase two,” he said.</p>
