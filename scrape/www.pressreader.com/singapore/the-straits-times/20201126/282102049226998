    <p>This year’s Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) saw 140 Pri­mary 6 pupils granted spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion due to Covid-19-re­lated rea­sons, with some miss­ing pa­pers be­cause they were on med­i­cal leave for an acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>These pupils ac­counted for 0.4 per cent of the 2020 PSLE co­hort.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 39,995 pupils re­ceived their re­sults, down from 40,256 pupils last year.</p>
    <p>To en­sure fair­ness to all in the light of the out­break, the Sin­ga­pore Ex­am­i­na­tions and As­sess­ment Board said on Mon­day that it had taken mul­ti­ple fac­tors into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded the pupils’ per­for­mance in the other pa­pers and their school co­hort’s per­for­mance for that af­fected sub­ject in the PSLE and their school-based ex­am­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Pupils yes­ter­day col­lected their re­sults in their class­rooms, in­stead of the school hall, which is the norm, due to the Covid-19 out­break this year.</p>
    <p>Do­ing it that way gave the chil­dren “the op­por­tu­nity to be with their class­mates and con­sult their teach­ers face to face on their next steps” when col­lect­ing their re­sults, said the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Due to the young age of PSLE pupils, a par­ent or guardian was al­lowed to ac­com­pany the child or ward to school to col­lect the re­sults.</p>
    <p>For the fifth year run­ning, 98.4 per cent of the pupils did well enough to progress to sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>It matched the rate from 2016 to last year, and re­mains the best per­for­mance since the na­tional exam was in­tro­duced in 1960.</p>
    <p>From 1980 to 2015, be­tween 81.7 per cent and 98.3 per cent of pupils who sat the PSLE were el­i­gi­ble to en­rol in sec­ondary schools.</p>
    <p>This year, 66.3 per cent of the co­hort qual­i­fied for the Ex­press course in sec­ondary schools, which is sim­i­lar to last year’s rate.</p>
    <p>In 2013, a record 66.7 per cent made it to the Ex­press course.</p>
    <p>Of the 2020 co­hort, 21.2 per cent are el­i­gi­ble for the Nor­mal (Aca­demic) course, and 11 per cent for the Nor­mal (Tech­ni­cal) course.</p>
    <p>Pupils el­i­gi­ble to en­rol in sec­ondary schools re­ceived op­tion forms when they col­lected their re­sult slips.</p>
    <p>They can ac­cess the on­line sys­tem to sub­mit their choices un­til Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Sec­ondary 1 post­ing re­sults will be re­leased on Dec 22.</p>
