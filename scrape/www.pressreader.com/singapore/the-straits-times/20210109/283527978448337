    <p>Many in­dus­tries were hit hard when the coro­n­avirus swept across the world last year. But by re­spond­ing quickly and em­brac­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) has en­sured that Sin­ga­pore re­tains its strate­gic po­si­tion as a global mar­itime hub.</p>
    <p>“The role of MPA dur­ing this pe­riod is es­pe­cially cru­cial,” says Ms Shen Wan­ling, as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of the In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Cen­tre (IMC) Di­vi­sion. The IMC works closely with ship own­ers and op­er­a­tors, part­ner­ing them to set up in Sin­ga­pore and iden­ti­fy­ing pro­grammes that en­able them to fur­ther en­trench their busi­ness op­er­a­tions here.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, 34, who un­der­took this role be­fore the pan­demic hit, recog­nised the im­por­tance of iden­ti­fy­ing new and in­no­va­tive ways to main­tain ex­ist­ing re­la­tion­ships with mar­itime com­pa­nies and build on new ones.</p>
    <p>By us­ing telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion tools to fa­cil­i­tate busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity, and host­ing vir­tual dis­cus­sions, we­bi­nars and events, her team man­aged to keep in close con­tact with stake­hold­ers to ad­dress their needs and se­cure more mar­itime in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen says her team pulled out all the stops to keep the in­dus­try re­silient dur­ing this chal­leng­ing pe­riod. They man­aged to fa­cil­i­tate safe and ef­fi­cient crew change at Sin­ga­pore’s ports, al­low­ing sea­far­ers to dis­em­bark and board ves­sels, while en­sur­ing that strict safety man­age­ment mea­sures were ad­hered to.</p>
    <p>It has been a lot of hard work. But Ms Shen and her MPA team were grat­i­fied when Sin­ga­pore re­tained its top spot on the 2020 Xin­hua-Baltic In­ter­na­tional Ship­ping Cen­tre Devel­op­ment Index for the sev­enth con­sec­u­tive year — no mean feat, given the chal­lenges faced by the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>A cu­rios­ity that led to a ca­reer</p>
    <p>A ca­reer in the mar­itime sec­tor seemed a nat­u­ral choice for Ms Shen. As a child, she was al­ways filled with cu­rios­ity when she saw ships an­chored off Sin­ga­pore’s coasts. So when she chanced upon the new Bach­e­lor of Sci­ence in Mar­itime Stud­ies at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, she took the plunge.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­a­tion, Ms Shen joined MPA full-time and worked in two di­vi­sions han­dling in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions and mar­itime pol­icy. Her ex­pe­ri­ences in­cluded co­or­di­nat­ing an in­ter­na­tional meet­ing in­volv­ing over 100 for­eign del­e­gates, and par­tic­i­pat­ing in key fo­rums such as those or­gan­ised by the In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly.</p>
    <p>A schol­ar­ship is not just a means of spon­sor­ship, it’s also a ca­reer choice in the near- to mid-term. Think about whether you would find it mean­ing­ful to work for the or­gan­i­sa­tion af­ter grad­u­a­tion. Ms Shen Wan­ling, as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of the In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Cen­tre Di­vi­sion, Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>In 2018, she com­pleted her Mas­ter of Public Ad­min­is­tra­tion at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don, which equipped her with the lead­er­ship and man­age­ment skills re­quired to head the In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Of­fice upon her re­turn. The Of­fice fo­cuses on strength­en­ing Sin­ga­pore’s long-term com­peti</p>
    <p>tive­ness as a global mar­itime hub.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen is grate­ful that MPA has al­ways sup­ported her ca­reer devel­op­ment by iden­ti­fy­ing ap­pro­pri­ate train­ing pro­grammes for her. She also cred­its her suc­cess to her men­tors and fel­low schol­ar­ship hold­ers, who pro­vided valu­able ad­vice on how to</p>
    <p>plan her ca­reer, while working on her im­me­di­ate mile­stones.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen’s ad­vice? “A schol­ar­ship is not just a means of spon­sor­ship, it’s also a ca­reer choice in the near- to mid-term. Think about whether you would find it mean­ing­ful to work for the or­gan­i­sa­tion af­ter grad­u­a­tion.”</p>
