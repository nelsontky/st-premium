    <p>You can call this a cafe for the home­less.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Catholic Wel­fare Ser­vices (CWS) started Prin­sep Cafe Ex­quis­ite, of­fer­ing free din­ners ev­ery evening to those sleep­ing on the streets, called rough sleep­ers.</p>
    <p>But it does not give t hem take­aways in sty­ro­foam con­tain­ers, a com­mon prac­tice linked to free meals given to vul­ner­a­ble groups.</p>
    <p>The Ro­man Catholic char­ity of­fers them what it de­scribes as a fine-din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence – to the home­less at least.</p>
    <p>At the din­ing hall of the Prin­sep Street Pres­by­te­rian Church, proper plates and cut­lery are used with the meals served by vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>There are table­cloths to dress up the ta­bles and even fresh flow­ers to brighten up the mood.</p>
    <p>And the food served spans cuisines from Chi­nese to Western.</p>
    <p>The meals are sponsored by bene­fac­tors.</p>
    <p>CWS pro­gramme man­ager Brian Monteiro said: “The rough sleep­ers don’t ask for money or pity.</p>
    <p>“They want re­spect, which the so­ci­ety may not give them.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of giv­ing them ‘tabao’ food, why not give them some­thing that they do not get – a fine din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, re­spect and dig­nity? It does not mean that when</p>
    <p>you are poor, you don’t de­serve dig­nity.”</p>
    <p>So far, the cafe has seen seven or eight reg­u­lars, many of whom come ev­ery night. And feed­back on the food served is ex­tremely good, he added.</p>
    <p>The char­ity is plan­ning to pro­vide break­fast take­aways so that the home­less can take with them the next day’s morn­ing meal af­ter their din­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Monteiro said: “Any­one who is home­less can come to eat for</p>
    <p>free and take a hot bath if he or she re­quires.”</p>
    <p>James (not his real name), 52, who is job­less, goes to the cafe al­most ev­ery night as he en­joys the food and the ex­pe­ri­ence, which is bet­ter than the free fare he gets else­where.</p>
    <p>He was sleep­ing rough on the streets for more than 10 years be­fore he moved into at least two dif­fer­ent tem­po­rary home­less shel­ters since the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>He moved into a shel­ter as he was afraid of be­ing caught loi­ter­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and catch­ing the coro­n­avirus on the streets.</p>
    <p>But some home­less peo­ple pre­fer to rough it out on the streets.</p>
    <p>Sixty-four-year-old Ed­ward (not his real name) has been home­less for the past eight years.</p>
    <p>The for­mer drug ad­dict said he is wor­ried about get­ting into fights and con­flicts with other men in the shel­ter, cit­ing past bad ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>He added: “My kind of per­son is more quiet and I like be­ing alone.”</p>
    <p>Mr Monteiro said some of the home­less men de­cline to stay in a shel­ter as they value their free­dom and do not like to fol­low the shel­ters’ rules.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment spokesman said: “De­spite be­ing en­gaged by com­mu­nity groups, and as­sisted by so­cial ser­vice of­fices and fam­ily ser­vice cen­tres, not all rough sleep­ers ac­cept of­fers to be put up in shel­ters.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, our part­ners con­tinue to en­gage and sup­port them.”</p>
    <p>Pas­tor Rick Toh, lead pas­tor of Yio Chu Kang Chapel, said: “Some peo­ple feel paiseh (em­bar­rassed) as they feel the shel­ters are for beggars. And they have jobs.</p>
    <p>“So we ex­plain to them it doesn’t mean that when you come to a shel­ter, you have no dig­nity.”</p>
