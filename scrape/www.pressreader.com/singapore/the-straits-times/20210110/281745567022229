    <p>•</p>
    <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for more ad­vanced nu­clear weapons and said the United States is “our big­gest en­emy”, state me­dia said yes­ter­day, pre­sent­ing a stark chal­lenge to US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den just days be­fore he takes of­fice.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s hos­tile poli­cies would not change re­gard­less of who oc­cu­pies the White House, but drop­ping those poli­cies would be key to North Korea-US re­la­tions, Mr Kim said, ac­cord­ing to state news agency KCNA.</p>
    <p>“Our for­eign po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties should be fo­cused and redi­rected on sub­du­ing the US, our big­gest en­emy and main ob­sta­cle to our in­no­vated de­vel­op­ment,” Mr Kim said dur­ing nine hours of re­marks over sev­eral days at a rare party congress in Py­ongyang.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter who is in power in the US, the true na­ture of the US and its fun­da­men­tal poli­cies to­wards North Korea never change,” Mr Kim said, vow­ing to ex­pand ties with “anti-im­pe­ri­al­ist, in­de­pen­dent forces”. North Korea would not “mis­use” its nu­clear weapons, he added, but the coun­try is ex­pand­ing its nu­clear arse­nal, in­clud­ing “pre­emp­tive” and “re­tal­ia­tory” strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties and war­heads of vary­ing sizes.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim called for de­vel­op­ing equip­ment in­clud­ing hy­per­sonic weapons, solid-fuel in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­siles (ICBMs), spy satel­lites, and drones.</p>
    <p>North Korea is pre­par­ing for the test­ing and pro­duc­tion of var­i­ous new weapons, in­clud­ing a “mul­ti­war­head rocket” and “su­per­sonic glid­ing flight war­heads for new­type bal­lis­tic rock­ets”, while re­search on a nu­clear sub­ma­rine is nearly com­plete, he said.</p>
    <p>“Kim pretty much showed what’s on his mind – sub­ma­rine mis­siles, bet­ter ICBMs and other ad­vanced arms,” said Pro­fes­sor Yoo Ho-yeol, a North Korean stud­ies ex­pert from Korea Univer­sity in Seoul. “He is say­ing that’s ba­si­cally what Wash­ing­ton will see go­ing for­ward, which could es­ca­late ten­sion or open doors for talks.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kim’s re­marks were one of the most am­bi­tious out­lines of North Korean na­tional de­fence and nu­clear mat­ters in some time, said Mr Ankit Panda, a se­nior fel­low at the US-based Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace.</p>
    <p>“It could presage a re­turn to nu­clear test­ing, which is now on the ta­ble given that Kim re­nounced his April 2018 mora­to­rium,” he said.</p>
    <p>There was no im­me­di­ate com­ment from the US State De­part­ment. A spokesman for the Bi­den cam­paign de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim crit­i­cised South Korea for of­fer­ing co­op­er­a­tion in “non­fun­da­men­tal” ar­eas such as coron­avirus aid and tourism, and said Seoul should stop buy­ing arms from and con­duct­ing mil­i­tary drills with the US.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Uni­fi­ca­tion Min­istry said it still hopes for bet­ter North Korea-US re­la­tions, and will con­tinue to pur­sue the de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion of the Korean penin­sula.</p>
    <p>“The in­au­gu­ra­tion of the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion can be a good op­por­tu­nity to im­prove US-North Korea re­la­tions, and we ex­pect re­la­tions to swiftly re­sume,” the min­istry said in a state­ment af­ter Mr Kim’s com­ments were re­leased.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who was vice-pres­i­dent un­der Pres­i­dent Barack Obama, called Mr Kim a “thug” dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign. In 2019, North Korea called Mr Bi­den a “ra­bid dog” that needed to be “beaten to death with a stick”.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim had three un­prece­dented meet­ings with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and the two cor­re­sponded in a se­ries of let­ters, but those ef­forts failed to lead to a de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion deal or of­fi­cial change in the coun­tries’ re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“North Korea is declar­ing the win­dow for co­op­er­a­tion is much, much smaller for the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion,” Prof Yoo said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said last Oc­to­ber that he would meet Mr Kim only on the con­di­tion that North Korea agreed to draw down its nu­clear ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Be­sides US and de­fence pol­icy, Mr Kim spoke at greater length on pro­pos­als for a five-year eco­nomic plan due to be an­nounced at the congress, which he said would con­tinue a fo­cus on build­ing an in­de­pen­dent econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The ba­sic seeds and themes of the new five-year eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment plan are still self-re­liance and self-suf­fi­ciency,” he said.</p>
    <p>North Korea faces grow­ing crises caused by in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions over its nu­clear pro­gramme, as well as self-im­posed lock­downs to pre­vent a coron­avirus out­break in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“In prac­ti­cal terms, there’s a dis­con­nect be­tween North Korea’s dire in­ter­nal eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion and this am­bi­tious nu­clear and mil­i­tary mod­erni­sa­tion agenda,” Mr Panda said.</p>
    <p>‘LOCK IN ON THE EN­EMY’</p>
    <p>Our for­eign po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties should be fo­cused and redi­rected on sub­du­ing the US, our big­gest en­emy and main ob­sta­cle to our in­no­vated de­vel­op­ment... No mat­ter who is in power in the US, the true na­ture of the US and its fun­da­men­tal poli­cies to­wards North Korea never change.</p>
