    <p>In­trigued by Chasen Hold­ings’ re­cent an­nounce­ment to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change that it had won $21 mil­lion worth of projects thanks to what it de­scribed as “an im­prove­ment in the re­gional econ­omy”, I went to see its man­age­ment last week to learn more about its story.</p>
    <p>Based in Jurong, Chasen, whose core busi­ness is the spe­cial­ist re­lo­ca­tion of high-value equip­ment used in elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­tur­ing and third-party lo­gis­tics, is one of those small and medium-sized op­er­a­tions that have pow­ered the East Asian eco­nomic mir­a­cle.</p>
    <p>Amid the worst health cri­sis in liv­ing mem­ory that dev­as­tated al­ready-slow­ing economies, the ro­bust­ness of the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors re­lated to semi-con­duc­tors, so­lar pan­els and thin film tran­sis­tor LCDs in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and China has thrown up new busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties for the group, led by chair­man Eric Ng, chief ex­ec­u­tive Justin Low and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ed­die Siah.</p>
    <p>More in­ter­est­ingly, in its 3PL – or third-party lo­gis­tics – seg­ment, Chasen is tak­ing ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties aris­ing from im­prov­ing road net­works in Asia as well as en­hanced se­cu­rity sys­tems and ve­hi­cle-track­ing mech­a­nisms. These de­tect within sec­onds if one of its ve­hi­cles has gone off the des­ig­nated route and thus re­duces the threat of truck hi­jack­ings – the scourge of long-dis­tance trans­porters.</p>
    <p>So Chasen can now safely truck cargo all the way from Sin­ga­pore to Shang­hai, the ve­hi­cles thread­ing a route up the Isth­mus of Kra and mak­ing a broad turn to the right to cross through Cam­bo­dia, Laos and Viet­nam to en­ter China. Se­cure seals in­tro­duced by Cus­toms author­i­ties that only they can open help trucks pass check­points with rel­a­tive ease, with­out the need to open cargo for in­spec­tion fre­quently.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is that goods that once used to move by air and sea are in­creas­ingly go­ing from fac­tory to fac­tory by the land route. Lo­gis­tics firms like Chasen are ad­just­ing in other ways as well; if once they pre­ferred full con­tainer loads, to­day they are happy to ac­cept par­tial loads or, in in­dus­try par­lance, loose con­tainer loads.</p>
    <p>Amid the ter­ri­ble eco­nomic con­trac­tion, Chasen trucks are go­ing two-thirds full, but that’s fine, ac­cord­ing to its top man­age­ment. What’s more, the firm is plan­ning on ex­pand­ing its fleet and en­hanc­ing fre­quency.</p>
    <p>Or take Sin­ga­pore’s Omni United, which fo­cuses on re­place­ment auto parts, chiefly tyres, for the global mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Founder G.S. Sa­reen says that in the con­fu­sion and panic of April, as the world felt the full im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic, he cut staff salaries by more than a third.</p>
    <p>Then the counter-in­tu­itive be­gan to man­i­fest. Even as sales of new cars and trucks slumped world­wide, the main­te­nance needs of ex­ist­ing ve­hi­cles in­creased. In his largest mar­ket, the United States, peo­ple shunned air travel and chose to use their cars over longer dis­tances, caus­ing a surge in de­mand.</p>
    <p>In­deed, for a time there seemed to be a short­age of tyres – de­mand that he, the owner of a com­pany some­times called the “Ikea of tyres”, cheer­ily stepped in to fill by draw­ing on ca­pac­ity across his var­i­ous Asia fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Since April, Mr Sa­reen tells me, busi­ness has grown by as much as 70 per cent and mar­gins by up to 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>“July was great, and Au­gust will be even bet­ter,” he says. “I am con­fi­dent we can keep grow­ing at this rate till the mid­dle of next year.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sa­reen says he is thank­ful to a re­spon­sive Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment and proac­tive bankers who stepped in to help his US$400 mil­lion (S$548 mil­lion) firm tide over its worst months. Omni United staff, he says, are see­ing salaries re­stored and even com­pen­sated for the pay cuts en­dured ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>Now, he is eye­ing an­other move to im­prove the bot­tom line: Work­ing from home in the past months has made him re­think the need for ex­pen­sive of­fice space in the down­town area.</p>
    <p>Why not use the money in a more pro­duc­tive way?</p>
    <p>STO­RIES OF ADAP­TA­TION</p>
    <p>Across Asia and its pe­riph­ery, the tini­est eco­nomic green shoots are com­ing into view as busi­nesses adapt to the chang­ing en­vi­ron­ment or in­no­vate and go the ex­tra mile for cus­tomers and con­sumers who them­selves are ad­just­ing pref­er­ences or find­ing new in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>In some in­stances, this is fu­elling de­mand that did not ex­ist pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Take Aus­tralians, a peo­ple de­fined by their love of the out­doors. For five decades, they were in­dus­try lead­ers in surf­boards and the Aus­tralian “thruster” de­sign had be­come the stan­dard for the sport.</p>
    <p>How­ever, thanks in part to a strong Aus­tralian dol­lar and ris­ing labour costs, the surf­board in­dus­try had seemed in dan­ger of col­lapse just eight years ago. Com­pa­nies such as Base and D’Arcy Surf­boards were ei­ther clos­ing or down­siz­ing.</p>
    <p>Now, Aus­tralians, de­nied team sports such as cricket and foot­ball, are back to in­di­vid­ual pur­suits and surf­ing is boom­ing. Ac­cord­ing to Ac­tionWatch, a com­pany that gen­er­ates re­tail data from ac­tion sports sec­tors, May sales of surf­boards in the seven-to-nine-feet cat­e­gory sky­rock­eted by 36 times com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, and re­main buoy­ant. One prom­i­nent man­u­fac­turer and re­tailer told ABC News that re­cent trade was like “Christ­mas in July”.</p>
    <p>Or take a look at the sec­tor of in­doors en­ter­tain­ment, such as casi­nos, which have had a ter­ri­ble six months. At the same time, on­line bet­ting – im­mune to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures – has soared. In­vestors have taken no­tice of firms that cater to this boom­ing sec­tor; DraftKings, an eight-year-old com­pany that fo­cuses on sports bet­ting and daily and weekly fan­tasy sports-re­lated con­tests, was val­ued at about US$6 bil­lion as it be­gan trad­ing on Nas­daq in late April. This week, its mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion ex­ceeded US$13 bil­lion as these words were writ­ten.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is some­thing to do with the hu­man spirit that it can­not be held down for very long. Whether it is work, play, feed­ing or the plea­sures we con­sume, we are back at it one way or the other. And sooner or later, the econ­omy re­flects it.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home, for in­stance, has spawned a raft of in­no­va­tions. One ex­am­ple by lo­cal com­pany MaNa is a por­ta­ble light­weight sit-stand-desk and lap­top case, claimed to be the first of its kind. Branded “Rizr”, it is set to for­mally launch next month.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, the pan­demic’s ef­fects are un­even if you look across sec­tors. Food, for in­stance, can never go out of fash­ion. Com­modi­ties ma­jor Olam, one of Sin­ga­pore’s most glob­alised com­pa­nies, is for­tu­nate to have 85 per cent of its port­fo­lio in food and feed in­gre­di­ents, all re­ces­sion-proof.</p>
    <p>While the sup­ply-side shock was sig­nif­i­cant be­cause of forced lock­downs in many of the 67 coun­tries where Olam op­er­ates, the firm could func­tion through the cri­sis be­cause many coun­tries treat food as an “es­sen­tial sec­tor”. Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Sunny Vergh­ese told a CNBC in­ter­viewer re­cently that for cen­tre-of-the-plate food items – such as food sta­ples – de­mand is ac­tu­ally go­ing up be­cause of re­stock­ing at both the house­hold and re­tail lev­els.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis has also forced Olam to find in­no­va­tive ways to reach the small farmer in re­mote ar­eas, jobs once done by field agents. Called an agron­omy nudge brain and us­ing ma­chine learn­ing and re­mote sens­ing tech­nol­ogy, it ad­vises in­di­vid­ual farm­ers through a voice brain that hands down in­struc­tions on the best ac­tion he can take on his land that day.</p>
    <p>The Asian travel in­dus­try took the sever­est beat­ing from Covid-19. But now, gov­ern­ments and air­lines are mov­ing apace to work out safe travel ar­range­ments, re­gard­less of the prospects of a trusted vac­cine be­ing dis­cov­ered to com­bat the virus. This week, Sin­ga­pore an­nounced that it will al­low pas­sen­gers from more des­ti­na­tions to transit at Changi Air­port, if us­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines. The In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion (ICAO) now has in place a “Take-off Guid­ance for Air Travel through the Covid-19 cri­sis”, rather like the way the in­dus­try re­acted to the se­cu­rity chal­lenge posed by the Sept 11 air­borne ter­ror­ist at­tacks, once the ini­tial shock had passed.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion has come up with its own health safety check­list fol­low­ing the ICAO guid­ance, en­com­pass­ing ev­ery­thing from pre-ar­rival no­ti­fi­ca­tion to air­craft clean­ing, on­board air qual­ity and even crew lay­over norms for air­lines to self-as­sess.</p>
    <p>Car­ri­ers eye­ing the long game are al­ready jock­ey­ing for pole po­si­tion even if they are un­able to fill cab­ins for now; In West Asia, Qatar Air­ways, the air­line that com­petes with Dubai-based Emi­rates for Asia-Europe and Asia-North Amer­ica traf­fic, just an­nounced it is re­sum­ing daily flights to Lon­don Gatwick, adding to its thrice-daily flights to Lon­don Heathrow.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, which cur­rently bans the en­try of all for­eign na­tion­als from 146 des­ig­nated coun­tries and re­gions in prin­ci­ple, said late last month it will dis­cuss with 12 Asian economies, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, on ways to re­sume travel.</p>
    <p>None of this is to make light of the morass Asia has slipped into thanks to Covid-19. To be sure, the eco­nomic con­trac­tions haven’t yet played out fully. Even as China has stag­gered back to its feet and may even eke out mild growth this year, ma­jor Asian economies such as those of Ja­pan, In­dia, In­done­sia and Thai­land are still in shock. But at some point – per­haps when ad­e­quate treat­ment fa­cil­i­ties are built up – the re­gion will fig­ure out that you just need to learn to live with the virus, and move on.</p>
    <p>Through it all you can sense the glim­mers, the pent-up de­mand wait­ing to un­load whether in man­u­fac­tured goods or ser­vices like travel and hospi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>In­dia tops the Asia count in Covid-19 cases. Yet, New Delhi-based Hero Mo­toCorp, which lays claim to be­ing the world’s largest man­u­fac­turer of mo­tor­cy­cles and scoot­ers, sold 514,509 units last month. That’s 14 per cent over the pre­vi­ous month and more than 95 per cent of whole­sale dis­patch num­bers of the cor­re­spond­ing July last year.</p>
    <p>Can’t yet travel to Ja­pan for your favourite sushi? Never mind, many Sin­ga­pore­ans are pay­ing top dol­lar to en­joy a slice of Ja­pan in their home city. Try get­ting a ta­ble reser­va­tion at Sushi Kimura – one of Sin­ga­pore’s finest, and prici­est, Ja­panese restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Mr Sa­reen likens the sit­u­a­tion to a pile-up on a For­mula One race track where the flag car emerges, the pole po­si­tion be­comes ir­rel­e­vant and con­tes­tants bunch up while the track is cleared for the con­test to start all over again. He isn’t too off the mark.</p>
    <p>Un­like in the Asian fi­nan­cial flu of 1997, many coun­tries in the re­gion were in bet­ter shape when the cur­rent cri­sis struck. There’s no rea­son to doubt that they will bounce back sooner when the mo­ment ar­rives. And since an econ­omy is noth­ing but a col­lec­tion of a na­tion’s busi­nesses, it stands to rea­son that firms that saw op­por­tu­nity dur­ing the cri­sis and recog­nised that many of the old ways of do­ing busi­ness are over will likely lead the way.</p>
