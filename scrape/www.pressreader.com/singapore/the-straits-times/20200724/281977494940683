    <p>The “invisible heart of so­ci­ety” is nec­es­sary for mar­kets to work well, and for gov­ern­ments to cu­rate and co­or­di­nate all play­ers so that there is a sense of mu­tu­al­ity of in­ter­ests, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shanmugara­tnam yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said economies can­not just rely on the invisible hand of the mar­ket or the vis­i­ble hand of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Mu­tu­al­ity of in­ter­ests is what al­lows the sys­tem to be dy­namic, as an econ­omy, but it also al­lows peo­ple to feel good about their role in so­ci­ety,” he added.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion about the need for a more ac­tivist and ex­panded gov­ern­ment for global co­op­er­a­tion and mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism at the DBS Asian In­sights Con­fer­ence, where he was one of two key­note speak­ers.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue, held at the start of the two-day con­fer­ence, is ti­tled “The Eco­nom­ics of a Pan­demic” and was mod­er­ated by DBS Bank chief econ­o­mist Taimur Baig.</p>
    <p>“I’ve no doubt that gov­ern­ments will grow in im­por­tance,” Mr Thar­man said, adding that the grow­ing em­pha­sis on governance will out­last the cur­rent Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, we need a new way of or­der­ing the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the state and mar­kets, and be­tween the state and com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man’s ref­er­ence to an invisible heart of so­ci­ety is a nod to The Third Pil­lar, a book pub­lished last year and writ­ten by Pro­fes­sor Raghu­ram G. Ra­jan of the Univer­sity of Chicago, the other key­note speaker.</p>
    <p>The invisible hand of the mar­ket or the vis­i­ble hand of the gov­ern­ment is not enough for mar­kets to do well, said Mr Thar­man.</p>
    <p>“You need the invisible heart of so­ci­ety,” he said. “State, mar­kets and com­mu­nity are the three pil­lars that keep so­ci­eties to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ra­jan, a for­mer Re­serve Bank of In­dia gov­er­nor and for­mer chief econ­o­mist at the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund, had ar­gued that strength­en­ing and em­pow­er­ing lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties help en­sure that groups are not left be­hind.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the di­a­logue, Prof Ra­jan stressed the i mpor­tance of coun­tries work­ing to­gether and called on global lead­ers to fo­cus on build­ing on sim­i­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Both speak­ers made the case for coun­tries to stay open for trade.</p>
    <p>Prof Ra­jan noted coun­tries that can­not stim­u­late do­mes­tic de­mand must then have growth com­ing from “out­side, at least in the re­cov­ery phase (of Covid-19), and this is why it’s ex­tremely im­por­tant that trade and global in­vest­ment re­main open over the next few years”.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had huge fric­tions be­fore the pan­demic, but (at) this point... we need lead­er­ship to call a truce.”</p>
    <p>“There is re­ally an enor­mous role for global lead­er­ship here, and es­pe­cially a com­ing to­gether of the two most im­por­tant coun­tries,” he added, re­fer­ring to the ten­sions be­tween the United States and China.</p>
    <p>“My hope is that the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion will be a turn­ing point (to im­prove on the two coun­tries’ ties),” said Prof Ra­jan.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said t he most thought­ful and for­ward-look­ing com­pa­nies are in­ject­ing some di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion in their global sup­ply chains, rather than mov­ing ev­ery­thing on­shore.</p>
    <p>He said: “They are go­ing for mul­ti­ple sup­ply chains, some­what sim­pler sup­ply chains, but there will still be a role for the Sin­ga­pores, Viet­nams, the Fin­lands of the world.</p>
    <p>“There will still be a role for coun­tries that are com­pet­i­tive at their game to be part of global sup­ply chains, and we must en­cour­age emerg­ing coun­tries to stay plugged in to the world, and not think that a do­mes­tic strat­egy alone is go­ing to get them out of the prob­lems we now face.”</p>
    <p>He added that the re­spon­si­bil­ity of all coun­tries is to keep both vir­tual and phys­i­cal lanes open.</p>
    <p>“There has been a ten­dency, be­cause of the pan­demic, to try to pro­tect my own coun­try first, but it is short-sighted.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that, even when it comes to the med­i­cal sup­ply chains and big global sup­ply chains, very few coun­tries are pro­duc­ing ev­ery­thing on their own.</p>
    <p>“In fact, vir­tu­ally no one is, so we de­pend on open sup­ply chains, even for essen­tials,” he said.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries may want to pro­duce a lit­tle more crit­i­cal sup­plies them­selves, “but we’re all go­ing to be de­pen­dent on pre­dictable and open lanes in­ter­na­tion­ally”, he added.</p>
    <p>On the pro­longed ul­tra-low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment, Mr Thar­man, who is chair­man of the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, said cen­tral banks have to do what it takes in a cri­sis but keep­ing in­ter­est rates low for too long may not be ideal.</p>
    <p>He warned of un­in­tended con­se­quences that may be brought about by the pro­longed ul­tra-low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>He said that even be­fore the Covid-19 cri­sis, the world had seen an ex­tended pe­riod of low in­ter­est rates and sub­stan­tial liq­uid­ity, con­tribut­ing to much higher lev­els of cor­po­rate lever­age.</p>
    <p>“We en­tered this cri­sis with a lot of risk in the sys­tem al­ready,” he said.</p>
    <p>Re­main­ing in a very long pe­riod of low or neg­a­tive in­ter­est rates will also hurt pen­sion funds, in­sur­ance funds and any long-term money man­age­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>Re­turns will come down, and peo­ple will be less pre­pared for re­tire­ment and may thus save more and con­sume less, damp­en­ing growth as a re­sult, he added.</p>
    <p>“So we need to be a lit­tle scep­ti­cal about this strat­egy as a means of pro­mot­ing growth,” he said.</p>
