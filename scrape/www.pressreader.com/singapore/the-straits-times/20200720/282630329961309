    <p>LONDON • Prince An­drew’s el­der daugh­ter Princess Beatrice mar­ried her Ital­ian busi­ness­man fi­ance last Fri­day in a small pri­vate cer­e­mony in front of Queen El­iz­a­beth II, after post­pon­ing the wed­ding be­cause of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Beatrice, 31, had been due to marry prop­erty de­vel­oper Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 37, at St James’s Palace in cen­tral London on May 29.</p>
    <p>But the nup­tials were on hold and no resched­uled date was given.</p>
    <p>Buck­ing­ham Palace con­firmed the cou­ple tied the knot in an unan­nounced cer­e­mony in­volv­ing a small num­ber of guests, in­clud­ing Prince Philip.</p>
    <p>“The pri­vate wed­ding cer­e­mony of Princess Beatrice and Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi took place at 11am (6pm Sin­ga­pore time) on Fri­day 17th July, at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Wind­sor,” the royal fam­ily said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The small cer­e­mony was at­tended by the Queen, the Duke of Ed­in­burgh (Prince Philip) and close fam­ily. The wed­ding took place i n ac­cor­dance with all rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment guide­lines.”</p>
    <p>The Queen, 94, and her 99-yearold hus­band have been self-iso­lat­ing at the cas­tle west of London be­cause their age puts them in a high-risk cat­e­gory for coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>She later knighted a 100-year-old World War II vet­eran who raised nearly £33 mil­lion (S$57.7 mil­lion) for Bri­tish health char­i­ties, and spoke about the wed­ding.</p>
    <p>“My grand­daugh­ter got mar­ried this morn­ing. Both Philip and I man­aged to get there – very nice,” she told Cap­tain Tom Moore after mak­ing him a “sir” in recog­ni­tion of his ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the royal fam­ily have been liv­ing in dif­fer­ent royal res­i­dences since the start of the lock­down in late March.</p>
    <p>Beatrice and her sis­ter Eu­ge­nie, 30, are the daugh­ters of Prince An­drew and his for­mer wife Sarah Fer­gu­son. Both at­tended the cer­e­mony, as did the groom’s par­ents, re­ports said.</p>
    <p>The princess is ninth in line to the throne and works for an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence soft­ware firm, while her hus­band is a count and the son of a for­mer Olympic skier.</p>
    <p>Mr Mapelli Mozzi, whose step­fa­ther was a friend of Bri­tain’s for­mer prime min­is­ter David Cameron, has a young son called Wolfie from a pre­vi­ous re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Prince An­drew stepped back from front-line royal du­ties last year after he caused out­rage in a tele­vi­sion in­ter­view by de­fend­ing his friend­ship with Jef­frey Ep­stein.</p>
    <p>Ep­stein, an Amer­i­can mil­lion­aire fi­nancier, was found dead in prison last year as he awaited trial on sex traf­fick­ing charges.</p>
    <p>Prince An­drew, 60, has de­nied claims that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl traf­ficked by Ep­stein.</p>
    <p>US in­ves­ti­ga­tors are keen to speak to the prince about his links to Ep­stein, after the ar­rest of Bri­tish so­cialite Ghislaine Maxwell on sex traf­fick­ing charges.</p>
