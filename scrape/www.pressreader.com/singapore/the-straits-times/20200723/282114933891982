    <p>helped her when she re­ceived threats and had to in­stall closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­eras in a place she was rent­ing out. The MP took 10 days to re­solve her prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“She is a very nice per­son, and she has a very big heart,” said Ms Jo Lee, who gave the re­tir­ing MP a thankyou card.</p>
    <p>A group of five friends, all res­i­dents of Nee Soon GRC, cre­ated a mem­ory board on which they mounted pic­tures they had taken with Ms Lee, thank-you mes­sages and hand­i­crafts. Ms Cyndi Tay, 47, who led the ef­fort, said: “This is a mem­ory for her. She has con­trib­uted to us for 14 years, is very kind to the el­derly and raised funds to help chil­dren. She is a very spe­cial MP.”</p>
    <p>Since step­ping down from pub­lic of­fice in 2017, Mr Teo Ser Luck, 52, has been liv­ing his child­hood dream of build­ing his own busi­nesses, with a string of ven­tures in sec­tors as var­ied as ed­u­ca­tion and fin­tech.</p>
    <p>The former Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC MP, who re­tired from pol­i­tics at the gen­eral elec­tion, said 14 years of pub­lic ser­vice have in­fused his en­tre­pre­neur­ial streak with the con­vic­tion that for-profit com­pa­nies must also do so­cial good.</p>
    <p>Grass­roots work and his time at agen­cies such as the Min­istry of Man­power showed him that even in de­vel­oped Sin­ga­pore, there were many who could use a leg-up.</p>
    <p>“The good thing I take out of it (pol­i­tics) is that you have more in­for­ma­tion and you un­der­stand more deeply that there is a lot more help that is needed,” he said, re­fer­ring to the de­lib­er­a­tions and per­spec­tives he had ac­cess to as a po­lit­i­cal of­fice-holder.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo spent about 11 years as a po­lit­i­cal of­fice-holder – “all high times, no low ones”, he said. The three-term MP added that his proud­est mo­ments in that pe­riod were when res­i­dents ben­e­fited from lo­cal pro­grammes he put in place.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo first stood for elec­tion in Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC in 2006. That same year, he was named par­lia­men­tary sec­re­tary in the then Min­istry of Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment, Youth and Sports, and be­came the youngest of­fice-bearer in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The avid sports­man was a key player in Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess­ful bid to host the in­au­gu­ral Youth Olympic Games in 2010, and also ini</p>
    <p>MORE HELP NEEDED</p>
    <p>The good thing I take out of it (pol­i­tics) is that you have more in­for­ma­tion and you un­der­stand more deeply that there is a lot ’’ more help that is needed. FORMER MP TEO SER LUCK, re­fer­ring to the de­lib­er­a­tions and per­spec­tives he had ac­cess to as a po­lit­i­cal of­fice-holder.</p>
    <p>tiated the na­tion’s cy­cling plan.</p>
    <p>Yet, Mr Teo said the jobs he has helped res­i­dents find and the spa­ces he has trans­formed in his ward of Sengkang Cen­tral were among the most ful­fill­ing parts of his time</p>
