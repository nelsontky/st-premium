    <p>LON­DON • The pound fell af­ter UK Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son ratch­eted up the chances of trade ne­go­ti­a­tions fail­ing with the Euro­pean Union (EU).</p>
    <p>Ster­ling de­clined as much as 0.6 per cent against the US dol­lar, ex­tend­ing its drop to the long­est since June, as Mr John­son pre­pared to tell the EU he’s will­ing to let talks fail, rather than com­pro­mise on what he sees as core Brexit prin­ci­ples.</p>
    <p>“It looks that we are only at the be­gin­ning of a painful cor­rec­tion lower i n the pound,” said Mr Valentin Mari­nov, head of Groupof-10 for­eign-ex­change strat­egy at Credit Agri­cole, who sees the pound drop­ping to US$1.20 in the event of no deal.</p>
    <p>The cost of hedg­ing against swings in the pound out to six months is at the high­est level since at least July, with the three-month tenor cov­er­ing the US elec­tion as well as Brexit devel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle sign of in­creased in­vestor con­cern among risk re­ver­sals, gauges of mar­ket po­si­tion­ing and sen­ti­ment, which are at their least bear­ish since March and largely un­changed fol­low­ing yes­ter­day’s news.</p>
    <p>Talks be­tween the two sides are set to con­tinue this week. The UK cur­rency had touched the high­est level this year last week amid broader weak­ness in the dol­lar.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are re­fo­cus­ing on Brexit with the two sides ac­cept­ing they need to reach a deal by next month to pave the way for a smooth exit at the end of the year, when the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ends. A so-called cliff-edge de­par­ture could add to the eco­nomic strain on the United King­dom from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>JPMor­gan Chase & Co strate­gists rec­om­mend a tra­di­tional bond-mar­ket hedge against a chaotic Brexit. They sug­gest selling 10-year Ir­ish debt, which would suf­fer given Ire­land’s close trad­ing re­la­tions with the UK, and buy­ing French bonds in­stead.</p>
    <p>“Our econ­o­mist’s as­sess­ment re­mains that the chance of no-deal is about a third, but with brinks­man­ship part of the process, it may ap­pear higher than that in com­ing weeks be­fore agree­ment is reached,” strate­gists in­clud­ing Mr Aditya Chor­dia wrote in a client note.</p>
    <p>By 1015 GMT, the cur­rency was down 1 per cent at US$1.3145, its low­est level since Aug 26, while against the euro, it touched a low of 89.90 pence.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s news on Brexit “is the cherry on top of the cake” for the be­leagured UK cur­rency, said cur­rency an­a­lyst Jor­dan Rochester at No­mura. He ex­pects the Bri­tish pound to con­tinue fall­ing against the euro ahead of an EU sum­mit due in the mid­dle of next month.</p>
