    <p>De­spite the rel­a­tively high cost of land and labour here, in­dus­try ob­servers are cau­tiously op­ti­mistic that Hyundai’s plans to make elec­tric cars in Sin­ga­pore will be vi­able.</p>
    <p>They also said the ven­ture will add value to the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Last week, The Straits Times re­ported that Hyundai Mo­tor will be set­ting up a plant here to make 30,000 elec­tric cars a year, with most of the vol­ume bound for ex­port. Tar­geted to be up by 2022, the plant will be the first au­to­mo­tive assem­bly fa­cil­ity here in nearly 40 years.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Busi­ness School Ad­junct As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Za­far Momin said that while Sin­ga­pore does not have a size­able do­mes­tic car mar­ket in re­la­tion to other South-east Asian coun­tries or an es­tab­lished au­to­mo­tive sup­ply base, it has world-class lo­gis­tics, a skilled tech­ni­cal and engi­neer­ing work­force, a more de­vel­oped in­fra­struc­ture and a busi­ness-friendly govern­ment.</p>
    <p>But Mr Say Kwee Neng, a 23-year mo­tor trade vet­eran and now a busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion leader, said that for any car man­u­fac­tur­ing busi­ness here to suc­ceed, find­ing “more cre­ative ways of amor­tis­ing the cost of in­vest­ing in plants and fa­cil­i­ties” is key.</p>
    <p>“Labour costs can be off­set by sell­ing higher-mar­gin prod­ucts, such as elec­tric ve­hi­cles, but not re­vis­ing poli­cies per­tain­ing to how these in­vest­ments can be treated would make the in­vest­ments ex­or­bi­tant, given our high land costs,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Say sug­gested cre­at­ing a “Jurong Is­land for the car in­dus­try, and amor­tis­ing this pub­lic cost over a longer pe­riod, given that it would bring sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fits such as em­ploy­ment to Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ron Lim, sales and mar­ket­ing head at mo­tor group Tan Chong, which has an assem­bly busi­ness in Thai­land, said Hyundai’s assem­bly ven­ture is fea­si­ble, given the longterm growth po­ten­tial of elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs) world­wide.</p>
    <p>“If suc­cess­ful, it could also cre­ate a whole new sup­port­ing in­dus­try, if the Govern­ment can at­tract more like-minded man­u­fac­tur­ers to in­vest here,” he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Za­far, pre­vi­ously an au­to­mo­tive an­a­lyst with Bos­ton Con­sult­ing</p>
    <p>LESS LABOUR-IN­TEN­SIVE</p>
    <p>Elec­tric ve­hi­cles have far less com­po­nents than tra­di­tional in­ter­nal com­bus­tion ve­hi­cles and are less labour-in­ten­sive to assem­ble... EV assem­bly re­quires rel­a­tively less cap­i­tal and scale to be cost-ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in such a foot­print in Sin­ga­pore may also give Hyundai an in­side track for fu­ture ’’ smart city con­tracts. NANYANG BUSI­NESS SCHOOL AD­JUNCT AS­SO­CI­ATE PRO­FES­SOR ZA­FAR MOMIN</p>
    <p>Group, added that the play­ing field is made more level since Hyundai will be making EVs here.</p>
    <p>“EVs have far less com­po­nents than tra­di­tional in­ter­nal com­bus­tion ve­hi­cles and are less labour-in­ten­sive to assem­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that Hyundai’s EV plat­form would incorporat­e a fair level of flex­i­ble and au­to­mated man­u­fac­tur­ing and prod­uct cus­tomi­sa­tion that re­quire more tech­nol­ogy and less labour.</p>
    <p>“EV assem­bly re­quires rel­a­tively less cap­i­tal and scale to be cost-ef­fec­tive,” Prof Za­far noted.</p>
    <p>“In­vest­ing in such a foot­print in Sin­ga­pore may also give Hyundai an in­side track for fu­ture smart city con­tracts.</p>
    <p>“This in­vest­ment will not pre­clude them from making other such larger EV in­vest­ments in South-east Asia.”</p>
    <p>He added that the plant “is clearly ben­e­fi­cial to Sin­ga­pore as it may at­tract other man­u­fac­tur­ers of EVs or auto com­po­nents to set up shop here”.</p>
    <p>Other ob­servers pointed out that EV assem­bly re­quires less space, too.</p>
    <p>The plant is part of Hyundai’s larger multi-func­tion com­plex of 28,000 sq m – just about one-third the foot­print of the Mercedes-Benz assem­bly plant in Hil­lview Av­enue which Cy­cle & Car­riage op­er­ated in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
