    <p>Amid a tank­ing job mar­ket and calls for fair hir­ing prac­tices, the Min­istry of Man­power’s</p>
    <p>Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress is timely.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo pledged yes­ter­day there will be fur­ther ad­just­ments to for­eign work­force poli­cies, in­clud­ing rais­ing the salary cri­te­ria for Em­ploy­ment Passes (EPs) and S Passes that al­low skilled foreigners to work in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The rea­son for the move, she said, is that Covid-19 has caused eco­nomic dis­rup­tion and pro­duced “slack” in the labour mar­ket – even though the pro­por­tion of lo­cal work­ers hold­ing pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) jobs is among the high­est in the world.</p>
    <p>Though de­tails will be made pub­lic later, the min­istry has made it clear that it wants to see busi­nesses com­mit to strength­en­ing their Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>It also wants them to di­ver­sify the na­tion­al­i­ties among the EP and S Pass hold­ers that they em­ploy.</p>
    <p>This comes in the wake of the an­nounce­ment ear­lier this month that an­other 47 em­ploy­ers have been added to the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF) watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices. Of these, 18 had foreigners com­pris­ing more than half of their PMET work­force, while 30 from the fi­nan­cial and pro­fes­sional ser­vices sec­tors had a high con­cen­tra­tion of</p>
    <p>PMETs from sin­gle na­tion­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo said: “We will en­sure that em­ploy­ers up­hold both the let­ter and spirit of the FCF.”</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), too, promised to de­velop a pipe­line of Sin­ga­pore­ans for se­nior re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to a $125 mil­lion pack­age with en­hanced sub­si­dies for train­ing and man­power costs, fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have also com­mit­ted to hire more un­der the SGUnited jobs and skills pro­grammes, and send work­ers on at­tach­ments in growth ar­eas such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI), cloud com­put­ing, cy­ber se­cu­rity and data an­a­lyt­ics, MAS said.</p>
    <p>Three other min­istries and agen­cies also re­leased their Ad­denda yes­ter­day: the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try, Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion (MCI), and Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF).</p>
    <p>In keep­ing with their com­mon theme of “weath­er­ing the storm and seiz­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties to trans­form our econ­omy”, the plans they de­scribed were not only about sav­ing jobs and pre­serv­ing core ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>They were also about keep­ing Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders – and its ap­proach to busi­ness and tal­ent – open and wel­com­ing.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said his min­istry will strengthen links with the world for mar­kets, sup­plies, tech­nol­ogy and tal­ent.</p>
    <p>It will also work with like-minded part­ners to keep trade routes open and en­sure the con­tin­ued flow of goods be­tween coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Trade in the dig­i­tal econ­omy will also get a boost through dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments.</p>
    <p>This open­ness and im­proved con­nec­tiv­ity make busi­ness sense for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies will have greater con­fi­dence in man­ag­ing their global plat­forms and dig­i­tal ser­vices from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But dig­i­tal in­clu­sion be­gins at home, and this is where the SG Dig­i­tal Of­fice will work with the com­mu­nity to bridge the dig­i­tal di­vide, said Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran.</p>
    <p>He added: “We will en­sure that all</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have a base­line level of af­ford­able dig­i­tal ac­cess, es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble groups such as low-in­come se­niors and fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>Even as it con­tin­ues to en­gage large global tech com­pa­nies as in­vestors and part­ners, MCI will also grow lo­cal dig­i­tal cham­pi­ons in ar­eas such as AI, cy­ber se­cu­rity and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, as well as dig­i­tal plat­form ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, NRF will in­vest in dig­i­tal and au­to­ma­tion tech­nolo­gies, and grow the lo­cal tal­ent pool in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy. It aims to do so by of­fer­ing trainee­ships in re­search and de­vel­op­ment lab­o­ra­to­ries, deep-tech start-ups, ac­cel­er­a­tors and in­cu­ba­tors.</p>
    <p>A com­mon thread that ap­pears to run through the Ad­denda is that sav­ing and cre­at­ing jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans – and wel­com­ing good com­pa­nies and peo­ple to set up shop here – are not mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>But pub­lic per­cep­tion will take time to change, given the mar­ket im­per­fec­tions on the ground.</p>
    <p>And heavy state in­vest­ment is no guar­an­tee of suc­cess in shep­herd­ing work­ers and busi­ness into a new in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Many small and medium-sized en­ter­prises re­main un­will­ing or un­able to make the quan­tum leap.</p>
    <p>How can re­search that is “trans­lated into mar­ketable so­lu­tions that cre­ate value” – as stated in NRF’s Ad­den­dum – be quan­ti­fied at the sys­tems level?</p>
    <p>Will multi­na­tion­als re­think their de­ci­sion to lo­cate here af­ter the for­eign man­power screws are tight­ened?</p>
    <p>Will the pur­suit of growth sec­tors lead to other ar­eas be­ing over­looked – be­cause they may not tick all the boxes in terms of the num­ber of jobs cre­ated, or the amount they in­vest and spend in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>These are ques­tions that have dogged pol­i­cy­mak­ers for decades, and which will likely pre­oc­cupy them for many more.</p>
    <p>It will be in­ter­est­ing to see if new back­benchers and the op­po­si­tion can in­vig­o­rate the plans with fresh ideas dur­ing the par­lia­men­tary de­bate next week – or run smack into the same dilem­mas and trade-offs that con­front gov­ern­ment pol­i­cy­mak­ers and plan­ners.</p>
