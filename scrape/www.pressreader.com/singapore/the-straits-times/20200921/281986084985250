    <p>The widow of a for­mer Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) of­fi­cer has al­leged that a death ben­e­fit claim for her hus­band was de­nied be­cause the Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) and in­surer Aviva had mis­han­dled a switch in pre­mium pay­ment meth­ods.</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old fi­nan­cial ad­viser, who de­clined to be named, said she was pre­vi­ously cov­ered un­der the Min­def and Min­istry of Home Af­fairs Group In­sur­ance as a de­pen­dent of her hus­band, who started pay­ing monthly pre­mi­ums through salary de­duc­tions from 1999.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­tary com­po­nent of the group in­sur­ance scheme of­fers a $1 mil­lion death ben­e­fit for monthly pre­mi­ums of $41 a per­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she was told that she could not claim that amount as the pol­icy had lapsed. The rea­son, she was told, was that her hus­band had failed to make pre­mium pay­ments af­ter Min­def and Aviva changed the pay­ment mode for the vol­un­tary scheme to Giro in 2017.</p>
    <p>Min­def and Aviva said they made the change so that ser­vice­men could con­tinue their vol­un­tary cover­age even if they left the min­istry or SAF, and were no longer on the pay­rolls of th­ese or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The widow’s hus­band, who held the rank of cap­tain, was 38 when he died in 2018. His death was not linked to his mil­i­tary du­ties.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, Min­def said its re­spon­si­bil­ity as a pol­icy owner was ful­filled through Aviva’s pay­ment of $150,000 to the widow in Fe­bru­ary last year un­der the group term life cover­age.</p>
    <p>This ba­sic in­sur­ance cover­age is paid for by Min­def for its ser­vice­men.</p>
    <p>A Min­def spokesman said: “Cover­age un­der the vol­un­tary scheme is a per­sonal ar­range­ment be­tween the in­di­vid­ual and Aviva.”</p>
    <p>She added that Min­def un­der­stood that Aviva sent four re­minder let­ters to the widow’s late hus­band be­tween Fe­bru­ary and Oc­to­ber 2017, in­clud­ing to his home ad­dress, to re­mind him to switch his pre­mium pay­ments to Giro if he wanted to con­tinue his vol­un­tary cover­age.</p>
    <p>“As no Giro ar­range­ments were made, the pol­icy was ter­mi­nated and a ter­mi­na­tion let­ter was sent in Novem­ber 2017,” said Min­def.</p>
    <p>The widow said she did not re­ceive any re­minder or ter­mi­na­tion let­ters from Aviva. She re­ceived a let­ter via reg­is­tered mail only in May last year – say­ing her claim was re­jected – af­ter she made a claim for the ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>She added that she was told that the pol­icy had lapsed only when she vis­ited the Aviva of­fice to file the death ben­e­fit claim on Jan 24 last year.</p>
    <p>She said Aviva should have sent the re­minder or ter­mi­na­tion let­ters via reg­is­tered mail to en­sure that ser­vice­men knew about the change, es­pe­cially in her case, as she can no longer buy the pol­icy as her hus­band is dead.</p>
    <p>Aviva, in re­sponse to queries, said it in­formed ser­vice­men of the change in pay­ment modes through let­ters as well as in-camp talks, and that “all in­sured mem­bers were given in­struc­tions... and were given suf­fi­cient time to do so”.</p>
    <p>About 600 brief­ing ses­sions were held in Min­def and SAF premises and road­shows from July 2016 to Novem­ber 2017, and af­fected ser­vice­men were given at least six months to make the switch, Min­def added.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Min­def nor Aviva was able to pro­vide num­bers on ex­actly how many ser­vice­men have had their poli­cies lapse as a re­sult of fail­ing to change their pay­ment modes in 2017.</p>
    <p>Aviva, which has been pro­vid­ing cover­age for SAF ser­vice­men since 1983, said that based on its records, there have been two cases in the past where claims were re­jected be­cause their poli­cies had lapsed.</p>
    <p>To avoid lapses in in­sur­ance cover­age, it ad­vised all in­sured mem­bers to reg­u­larly check and take charge of their fi­nances.</p>
    <p>But the widow said she is at her wits’ end, and is con­sid­er­ing sell­ing her house af­ter her sav­ings run out to bring up her two chil­dren, aged 10 and eight. She added that she de­clined to have her name made pub­lic as she does not want her chil­dren to be af­fected by the pub­lic­ity.</p>
    <p>She said: “Af­ter the first case of an in­ad­ver­tent pol­icy lapse or failed claim sur­faced, why didn’t Aviva or Min­def do more to en­sure that ser­vice­men made the pay­ment mode change, es­pe­cially since this change was not ini­ti­ated by ser­vice­men?”</p>
    <p>She added that she hopes more ser­vice­men or their fam­ily mem­bers in a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion would come for­ward, as she be­lieves she is not the only one af­fected by not hav­ing switched the pay­ment method for the pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>SEEK­ING AN­SWERS</p>
    <p>Af­ter the first case of an in­ad­ver­tent pol­icy lapse or failed claim sur­faced, why didn’t Aviva or Min­def do more to en­sure that ser­vice­men made the pay­ment mode change, es­pe­cially since this change was not ini­ti­ated by ser­vice­men?</p>
