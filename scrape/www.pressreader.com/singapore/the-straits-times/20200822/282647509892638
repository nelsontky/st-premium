    <p>• An­ge­lababy has been slammed in the past for her poor act­ing skills and even her hus­band, ac­tor Huang Xiaom­ing, joined in the on­line cho­rus of crit­ics in 2018.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old model-ac­tress has been crit­i­cised for hav­ing sim­i­lar ex­pres­sions whether she is cry­ing, smil­ing or be­ing an­gry, with some say­ing she has only one ex­pres­sion – a wide-eyed one.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the cast mem­ber of Chi­nese va­ri­ety show Keep Run­ning (2014 to present) ap­pears to have won some peo­ple over in her lat­est role (right) in the Web drama, A Mur­der­ous Af­fair In Hori­zon Tower.</p>
    <p>The mys­tery se­ries, based on the novel of the same name by Chi­nese au­thor Chen Xue, de­buted on Wed­nes­day with its first four episodes, kick­ing off with the death of cafe owner Zhong Meibao, played by An­ge­lababy. It also stars Guo Tao, Yang Zis­han and Jiao Gang.</p>
    <p>An­ge­lababy had sev­eral cry­ing scenes in the se­ries – some had her merely tear­ing up, while oth­ers in­volved her shed­ding tears.</p>
    <p>Some fans praised her nat­u­ral ex­pres­sions, which they said helped bring out her emo­tions when she cried.</p>
    <p>Still, there were view­ers who were not con­vinced by her per­for­mance and said she looked like she was smil­ing and cry­ing at the same time. Some ques­tioned if she used eye drops be­fore film­ing the scenes.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, who makes only a guest ap­pear­ance in the drama, ended up steal­ing the thun­der from the other stars, when “An­ge­lababy cry­ing” be­came a trend­ing topic on Weibo af­ter the show aired.</p>
