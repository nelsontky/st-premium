    <p>Former Cab­i­net min­is­ter S. Jayaku­mar stepped down from pol­i­tics in 2011, but car­ries on do­ing pub­lic ser­vice. He is still a reg­u­lar face at the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) where he is a se­nior le­gal ad­viser to Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>When­ever Sin­ga­pore is in­volved in com­plex le­gal or diplo­matic is­sues, Pro­fes­sor Jayaku­mar is called upon to help, given his in­sti­tu­tional knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>For his “sus­tained and in­valu­able con­tri­bu­tions to the na­tion”, he has been con­ferred the Or­der of Te­masek (With High Dis­tinc­tion), top­ping the list of this year’s Na­tional Day Award re­cip­i­ents. He is the 10th Sin­ga­porean to re­ceive the na­tion’s high­est civil­ian hon­our.</p>
    <p>The 80-year-old, who served as diplo­mat and min­is­ter, said he was grate­ful and sur­prised by the ges­ture: “All these mat­ters I have been in­volved with con­cern im­por­tant na­tional in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore. If Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan feel that it will be ben­e­fi­cial for me to share my ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge, how can I say no?”</p>
    <p>This sense of duty to Sin­ga­pore has been his mo­ti­vat­ing force in a pub­lic ser­vice ca­reer span­ning close to 50 years.</p>
    <p>As a young law pro­fes­sor, he was called on to be Sin­ga­pore’s per­ma­nent rep­re­sen­ta­tive to the United Na­tions from 1971 to 1974. He re­turned to academia and was dean of the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) law fac­ulty till he joined pol­i­tics in 1980.</p>
    <p>As a law aca­demic, he was also roped in on chal­leng­ing is­sues like Pe­dra Branca and the wa­ter agree­ments with Malaysia. So it was no sur­prise that he would be the go-to per­son when Sin­ga­pore got volved in com­plex le­gal is­sues.</p>
    <p>But what Prof Jayaku­mar brought to the ta­ble was not just le­gal ex­per­tise, but also diplo­matic nous, say those who have worked with him.</p>
    <p>As for­eign min­is­ter from 1994 to 2004, he over­saw a range of com­plex bi­lat­eral is­sues, in­clud­ing an agree­ment un­der which the Malayan Rail­way would va­cate the land at Tan­jong Pa­gar, the Pe­dra Branca dis­putes with Malaysia, as well as trans­bound­ary haze prob­lems in­volv­ing In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Even as he fought fiercely to pro­tect Sin­ga­pore’s le­gal in­ter­ests, he never for­got the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing good re­la­tions with neigh­bour­ing and other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess­ful elec­tion to a non-per­ma­nent seat at the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil from 2001 to 2002 was “a re­flec­tion of his strong lead­er­ship and in­flu­ence in fos­ter­ing ex­ten­sive ties and Sin­ga­pore’s es­teemed global rep­u­ta­tion” said an MFA spokesman.</p>
    <p>In 2007, Prof Jayaku­mar led the team that suc­cess­fully pleaded Sin­ga­pore’s case on Pe­dra Branca at the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice at the Hague. In 2017, he was once again called upon to help when Malaysia filed ap­pli­ca­tions to re­vise and in­ter­pret the judg­ment that awarded sovereignt­y over the out­crop to Sin­ga­pore. Malaysia dropped its ap­pli­ca­tions in 2018.</p>
    <p>On why he con­tin­ues to help, Prof Jayaku­mar, who had also held the Law and Home Af­fairs port­fo­lios, said he hoped to con­trib­ute his in­sti­tu­tional knowl­edge, and through do­ing so de­velop new gen­er­a­tions of of­fice-hold­ers, diplo­mats and in­ter­na­tional lawyers. He had served as deputy prime min­is­ter, co­or­di­nat­ing min­is­ter for na­tional se­cu­rity and se­nior min­is­ter be­fore step­ping down from pol­i­tics in 2011.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with the younger gen­era</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE AL­WAYS ON HIS MIND</p>
    <p>He puts his en­tire mind, his en­tire soul, into what is in Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­est. I get the sense that he thinks about how we can ad­vance Sin­ga­pore’s cause all the time. It’s con­stant and con­sis­tent.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MS DAPHNE HONG, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs Di­vi­sion at the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, on Pro­fes­sor S. Jayaku­mar.</p>
    <p>in­tion of pub­lic ser­vants has been a great ex­pe­ri­ence, he said: “They are very bright and hard-work­ing. I also have learnt from them.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore now has an ex­cel­lent new gen­er­a­tion of diplo­mats and in­ter­na­tional lawyers. They can hold their own with any of their coun­ter­parts from other coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>The MFA spokesman said his rich ex­pe­ri­ence and strate­gic per­spec­tives in man­ag­ing sen­si­tive bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral is­sues have ben­e­fited many of the younger gen­er­a­tion of for­eign and le­gal ser­vice of­fi­cers work­ing with him.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Daphne Hong, direc­torgen­eral of the In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs Di­vi­sion at the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, who worked on the Pe­dra Branca is­sue in 2017: “It be­came ap­par­ent that he puts his en­tire mind, his en­tire soul, into what is in Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­est. I get the sense that he thinks about how we can ad­vance Sin­ga­pore’s cause all the time. It’s con­stant and con­sis­tent.”</p>
    <p>This year, two Dis­tin­guished Ser­vice Or­der awards were con­ferred on Mr Koh Choon Hui, 79, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Chil­dren’s So­ci­ety (SCS), and Pro­fes­sor Wang Gungwu, 89, found­ing chair­man of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy at NUS, and the former chair­man of the ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute and East Asian In­sti­tute (EAI).</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, a stal­wart of the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor for over four decades, had not only ex­panded the SCS’ reach but also nur­tured many so­cial ser­vice agen­cies.</p>
    <p>One of his en­dur­ing con­tri­bu­tions was to align the pay scales of so­cial ser­vice sec­tor work­ers with those of the civil ser­vice when he was act­ing hon­orary gen­eral sec­re­tary and vice-pres­i­dent of the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice from 1992 to 2000, lay­ing the ground­work for the sec­tor to re­cruit and re­tain staff. Said the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment: “His con­tri­bu­tions have na­tion­wide and long-term im­pact on the lives of many Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Mr Koh said of the award: “It is also a recog­ni­tion of the many won­der­ful vol­un­teers I have worked with over the decades who have given self­lessly to help oth­ers. They have made my jour­ney a very mem­o­rable and mean­ing­ful one.”</p>
    <p>Prof Wang, a his­to­rian who played a key role in build­ing up and grow­ing the three in­sti­tutes, is recog­nised for strength­en­ing Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as an in­de­pen­dent base for lead­ing re­search on China and East Asia among other things, said the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>He said on Fri­day: “I have en­joyed all the work I have been able to do and learnt a great deal while do­ing it. This is an hon­our I share with my wife Mar­garet whose deep feel­ings for Sin­ga­pore have made my work here all the more sat­is­fy­ing.”</p>
    <p>His wife, who died yesterday, had been a big fac­tor in his de­ci­sion to leave Hong Kong and re­turn to Sin­ga­pore in 1996 to lead the then In­sti­tute of East Asian Po­lit­i­cal Econ­omy, which be­came the EAI.</p>
