    <p>A Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) stu­dent al­legedly as­saulted a wo­man in a stu­dent hous­ing unit on cam­pus on March 21 last year.</p>
    <p>Korean Kim Do­hyung, 22, whose case was heard in a dis­trict court last Wed­nes­day, is ac­cused of one count of caus­ing bod­ily pain to her.</p>
    <p>He is said to have hit the wo­man on her right outer arm, right fore­arm and left thigh, caus­ing bruises.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent is said to have hap­pened at the Prince Ge­orge’s Park Res­i­dences. When con­tacted by The Straits Times, NUS would not say whether Kim is still a stu­dent of the univer­sity, say­ing the case is now be­fore the courts.</p>
    <p>Kim is one of sev­eral stu­dents from lo­cal ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions who have ap­peared in court in re­cent months over var­i­ous of­fences.</p>
    <p>One of them, Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) stu­dent Lee Yan Ru, al­legedly out­raged a wo­man’s mod­esty on cam­pus on Jan 8 last year.</p>
    <p>The wo­man, who is study­ing at an­other univer­sity, can­not be named due to a gag or­der.</p>
    <p>Lee, now 24, has claimed trial and his case is still pend­ing. He re­mains an SMU stu­dent pend­ing the out­come of the court trial and the univer­sity’s dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings, the univer­sity said.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, for­mer Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) stu­dent Han Shiyu, 18, was sen­tenced to a short de­ten­tion or­der of two weeks af­ter he tres­passed into a fe­male toi­let at a res­i­den­tial hall to film a fel­low stu­dent who was in the shower.</p>
    <p>Those given a short de­ten­tion or­der are put be­hind bars for a short time, but will not have a crim­i­nal record af­ter their re­lease.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese na­tional com­mit­ted the of­fence on Aug 12 last year and was ex­pelled soon af­ter by NTU.</p>
    <p>Kim’s case has been ad­journed to Oct 7. Of­fend­ers con­victed of as­sault can be jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000.</p>
