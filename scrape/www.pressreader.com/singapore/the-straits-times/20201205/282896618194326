    <p>Savvy shop­pers know to head to the Thai su­per­mar­ket on t he sec­ond floor of Golden Mile Com­plex when they want fresh straw mush­rooms and es­o­teric Thai herbs, or need chilli and spice pastes, Thai toi­letries and snacks.</p>
    <p>Now, the 35-year-old busi­ness wants to tar­get more than j ust savvy shop­pers. It is go­ing af­ter mil­len­ni­als.</p>
    <p>It has launched an on­line store (www.thaisu­per­mar­ket.sg), stocked with the lat­est snacks, plus in­stant noo­dles and bev­er­ages from Thai­land; the sort of thing that will ap­peal to a younger crowd.</p>
    <p>Also new is the 555 Snack­box, priced at $29.90 and avail­able only on­line. The num­ber five is pro­nounced “ha” in Thai, and 555 is the equiv­a­lent of LOL. The box is packed with munchies that in­clude Lay’s potato chip col­lab­o­ra­tions with KFC and Pizza Hut; crunchy Shrimpy Chin, which are fried prawn chins; HuaHed Crispy Enoki Mush­room snacks and Manora Shrimp Chips.</p>
    <p>To draw newly ac­quired cus­tomers to Golden Mile Com­plex, the box i ncludes an “air ticket” for them to get dis­counts or free dishes from one of six Thai restau­rants in the build­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh Yuen Seng, 56, one of the founders of Thai Su­per­mar­ket, says this is nec­es­sary evo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“We have to move with the times,” he says. “We have to go dig­i­tal and we need to tar­get younger shop­pers. If you live in Sengkang or Jurong, it might not be con­ve­nient for you to come to Golden Mile. Now, you can buy on­line.</p>
    <p>He tells The Straits Times that dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, his staff fielded many calls from cus­tomers want­ing to know if the store was open. Then, they went to the su­per­mar­ket and cleaned out stocks of in­stant noo­dles, canned food and sauces such as fish sauce.</p>
    <p>To take the busi­ness to a new level, he en­listed his two cam­erashy daugh­ters, Wan Ting, 24; and Wan Jing, 28; and his niece Vanida, 27, to set up the store’s on­line pres­ence and cu­rate the se­lec­tion of goods for it.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised that younger peo­ple come to Golden Mile Com­plex for the food, then they leave,” he says.</p>
    <p>He set about think­ing up ways to make them stay and shop. At the same time, he saw the surge in on­line shop­ping dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, and the rise in pop­u­lar­ity of snacks from China. He saw the po­ten­tial for Thai munchies to catch fire on­line too.</p>
    <p>With travel re­stric­tions ground­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, he has a cap­tive au­di­ence of peo­ple long­ing for a taste of Bangkok.</p>
    <p>Ms Vanida Loh says she and her cousins do re­search on the lat­est food trends in Thai­land, gath­er­ing in­for­ma­tion from Thai in­flu­encers and talk­ing to the com­pany’s sup­pli­ers there.</p>
    <p>She says: “Our agent in Thai­land sends us sam­ples and we track Thai me­dia and in­flu­encers, and look at what prod­ucts we can source. We’re learn­ing as we go along.”</p>
    <p>Her cousin Loh Wan Ting adds: “We want to bring in prod­ucts we be­lieve in.”</p>
    <p>Keep­ing up to date with what is hap­pen­ing in Thai­land and be­ing re­spon­sive to changes have been part of the com­pany’s DNA since it started. Yen In­vest­ments, the com­pany which runs the su­per­mar­ket, was set up by Mr Loh and his four broth­ers in 1987. But Mr Loh had been do­ing busi­ness in Golden Mile Com­plex since 1985, when he sold trousers in a tai­lor shop.</p>
    <p>The broth­ers saw the po­ten­tial for Golden Mile Com­plex to be­come Lit­tle Thai­land. At the time, there were con­struc­tion sites in the area and Thai work­ers would throng the com­plex to shop and eat.</p>
    <p>They soon sussed out what the cus­tomers wanted – Mr Loh speaks flu­ent Thai – and their busi­ness flour­ished, with a min­i­mart, restau­rants, and shops sell­ing cas­sette tapes, Thai mag­a­zines and gold. They also started a remit­tance busi­ness, which is still run­ning. Start­ing in the 1990s, they bought shop units in the build­ing, and they have more than 90 of them now, some of which they rent out.</p>
    <p>At one point, they even had a 100-seat cin­ema in the build­ing, screen­ing the lat­est Thai movies of the day.</p>
    <p>From about 400 sq ft, their min­i­mart grew, and is now 9,000 sq ft in size.</p>
    <p>“On pay day, we could sell 1,000kg of beef,” says Mr Loh.</p>
    <p>The build­ing was, at times, rowdy, and he re­mem­bers hav­ing to hire bounc­ers for the su­per­mar­ket in the 1990s, for crowd con­trol.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ters and niece are learn­ing about the his­tory of the com­pany and of the build­ing.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery time we come here, we learn some­thing new,” Ms Vanida Loh says.</p>
    <p>To­day, Sin­ga­porean shop­pers make up half the cus­tomers at the su­per­mar­ket, with Thais mak­ing up 40 per cent. The re­main­ing 10 per cent are ex­pa­tri­ate shop­pers from Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Golden Mile Com­plex has been up for a col­lec­tive sale twice, with a price tag of $800 mil­lion, but there were no tak­ers. The Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity is propos­ing to con­serve the build­ing for its his­tor­i­cal and ar­chi­tec­tural sig­nif­i­cance, without block­ing a po­ten­tial col­lec­tive sale. It is of­fer­ing de­vel­op­ers ad­di­tional plan­ning in­cen­tives, in­clud­ing a one-third in­crease in floor area with a waiver of part of its de­vel­op­ment charge and the op­tion to ad­just the bound­ary of the 1.3ha site.</p>
    <p>If the build­ing is sold, Mr Loh says he will look for an al­ter­na­tive space for the su­per­mar­ket, but adds that it is likely to re­main where it is for the next three to five years.</p>
    <p>So, aside from the on­line store, he has spruced up parts of the su­per­mar­ket to en­tice cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>There is now an invit­ing dis­play of Thai fruit at the en­trance. Soon, there will be new chillers for the pro­duce and, in the new year, three to four new food stalls will open, sell­ing fried chicken and fruit juices, among other things.</p>
    <p>“We are build­ing more brand aware­ness,” he says. “We’ve never done mar­ket­ing be­fore.”</p>
