    <p>• Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer praised his team’s con­sis­tent form on their trav­els, af­ter they main­tained a 100 per cent away record with a 3-1 Pre­mier League win at West Ham on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils have now won on five away trips this sea­son, com­ing from be­hind in all of them, and also set a new club record in the process with their eighth suc­ces­sive league win on the road dat­ing back to last term.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the vis­i­tors, who have a game in hand on lead­ers Chelsea, pro­vi­sion­ally moved into the top four for first time this sea­son. And af­ter a mixed start to the cam­paign, United are start­ing to show some solid form.</p>
    <p>“Of course, you are very, very happy with the away form. I think the home form is de­cent, we are be­com­ing more and more con­sis­tent and we are coping bet­ter with games like this,” Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
    <p>“When you are 1-0, 2-0 down, the boys still be­lieve and that char­ac­ter is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“Away from home, we have char­ac­ter and be­lief. Five times on the bounce to come from be­hind and win is ex­cep­tional.”</p>
    <p>United had been well be­low their best in the first half, trail­ing 1-0 at the break to To­mas Soucek’s strike be­fore Sol­sk­jaer threw on two play­ers he had hoped to rest – Bruno Fer­nan­des and Mar­cus Rash­ford – ahead of their cru­cial fi­nal Cham­pi­ons League group game at RB Leipzig to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-half goals from Paul Pogba, Ma­son Green­wood and Rash­ford turned things around, but the hard-fought vic­tory came at a cost as United lost Edin­son Ca­vani and An­thony Mar­tial to in­juries.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer all but ruled them out of the trip to Ger­many, where they must avoid de­feat to ad­vance to the knock­out phase but felt he had the squad depth to cope.</p>
    <p>“It is un­for­tu­nate... some­times, you get mus­cle in­juries. We lost An­thony and Edin­son,” he told Sky Sports. “There’s a game al­ready on Tues­day. But it’ll prob­a­bly be (like this) this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Some games, we have to do with­out play­ers and I’m glad we’ve got the sub­sti­tu­tions we have. At the end of the sea­son, you don’t</p>
    <p>care about the per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, we know there are things we need to im­prove on, some sim­ple passes in the first half but the sec­ond half, that qual­ity came back and all three goals were ex­cep­tional.</p>
    <p>“Bruno and Mar­cus came on and did well. First half, we had loads of pos­ses­sion but we didn’t go any­where with the ball. Sec­ond half, we stretched them more and ran in be­hind. The qual­ity was much bet­ter, the goals were ex­cep­tional.”</p>
