    <p>SHANG­HAI • In Jan­u­ary 2017, Brazil in­ter­na­tional Os­car moved from Chelsea to Shang­hai SIPG for an Asian-record €60 mil­lion (S$97.5 mil­lion), prompt­ing a warn­ing from then Ar­se­nal boss Arsene Wenger that Chi­nese clubs were dis­tort­ing the global trans­fer mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Four years later, it is a very dif­fer­ent story af­ter the Chi­nese Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (CFA) im­posed a se­ries of mea­sures to cool ex­trav­a­gant spend­ing in the Chi­nese Su­per League, markedly dim­ming its star power.</p>
    <p>Six months af­ter Os­car’s ar­rival, the CFA slapped a 100 per cent tax on in­com­ing for­eign­ers, with the levy go­ing to de­vel­op­ing Chi­nese youth play­ers.</p>
    <p>Then last month, the CFA said that overseas play­ers can­not earn more than €3 mil­lion a year, while do­mes­tic play­ers also saw their salaries capped.</p>
    <p>“CSL club ex­pen­di­ture is about 10 times higher than South Korea’s K-League and three times higher than Japan’s J-league,” said CFA pres­i­dent Chen Xuyuan. “But our na­tional team is lag­ging far be­hind. The bub­bles not only af­fect the present of Chi­nese foot­ball, but also its fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>All play­ers must now have new con­tracts, ac­cord­ing to the state news agency Xinhua, adding that teams can sign “sup­ple­men­tal agree­ments” with play­ers whose ex­ist­ing deals are above the cap.</p>
    <p>That means Os­car, 29, will con­tinue to earn more than €20 mil­lion a year for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>But the mes­sage is clear: the days of in­flated trans­fer fees and salaries to lure star play­ers from Eu­rope are over.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­triot and former SIPG team­mate Hulk, a €55.8 mil­lion pur­chase in 2016, left the club last month when his con­tract ex­pired.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian for­ward Graziano Pelle was an­other high-profile exit ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>Both play­ers’ best days are be­hind them and a Chi­nese web­site said their de­par­tures “her­alded the end of the su­per-lux­ury for­eign play­ers era”.</p>
    <p>As well as Os­car, some of the big names who ar­rived in re­cent years still re­main in the CSL, no­tably former Barcelona mid­fielder Paulinho and former Manch­ester United mid­fielder Marouane Fel­laini.</p>
    <p>But the pool is shrink­ing and the last ma­jor sign­ing in the CSL was Marko Ar­nau­tovic from West Ham in July 2019 for €25 mil­lion, again to SIPG.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent i nter­view with Agence France-Presse, CFA sec­re­tary-gen­eral Liu Yi de­nied that the loss of for­eign stars made the CSL less at­trac­tive, point­ing out that it is still at­tract­ing top coaches, such as Cham­pi­ons League win­ner Rafa Ben­itez at Dalian Pro.</p>
    <p>But Liu said that “the bench­mark is not sup­posed to be about spend­ing, it’s about sus­tain­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>“The profile (of the CSL) has al­ready been there be­cause of the big spend­ing – Os­car, Hulk etc,” he added. “But now we are look­ing at bet­ter gov­er­nance, a more sus­tain­able busi­ness model and bet­ter youth academy sys­tem to de­velop youth play­ers to make our na­tional team more com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“Some big play­ers are still play­ing here but has that helped the devel­op­ment of the lo­cal play­ers?”</p>
    <p>Ahead of the new sea­son in the spring, and with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic still on­go­ing, no one is talk­ing about high-profile play­ers mov­ing to the CSL any more.</p>
    <p>In­stead, teams are look­ing at loans, free trans­fers or sign­ings un­der the 45 mil­lion yuan (S$9.2 mil­lion) thresh­old that would trig­ger the 100 per cent trans­fer tax.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in the Ori­en­tal Sports Daily, colum­nist Ge Aip­ing said that the CSL “peaked” in 2015 and 2016 as the star names rolled in.</p>
    <p>Along with the CFA mea­sures, most CSL clubs can no longer af­ford to in­vest like they did as the league has been re­placed by a “fru­gal” ver­sion.</p>
    <p>“Which is bet­ter – the 2015 and 2016 Chi­nese Su­per League or the ‘thrifty’ Chi­nese Su­per League start­ing in 2021?” Ge wrote. “From a view­ing stand­point, of course it is the former.</p>
    <p>“A fru­gal Chi­nese Su­per League can at least re­serve strength for bet­ter devel­op­ment.”</p>
