    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Global coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions passed 15 mil­lion yesterday, as coun­tries grap­pled to con­tain the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The to­tal of 15,107,017 cases is at least triple the num­ber of se­vere in­fluenza ill­nesses recorded an­nu­ally, ac­cord­ing to World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) data, while the death toll of more than 616,000 in seven months is close to the up­per range of yearly in­fluenza deaths.</p>
    <p>The global tally reached the grim new mile­stone after India, which has the third-largest num­ber of in­fec­tions in the world be­hind the United States and Brazil, re­ported al­most 40,000 new cases in its daily up­date.</p>
    <p>While the Amer­i­can con­ti­nent is still the ma­jor hot spot, the WHO said yesterday that Covid-19 is ac­cel­er­at­ing in Africa.</p>
    <p>Wor­ry­ing trends of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion are also emerg­ing in south­ern Europe and in the Balkan re­gion, warned the WHO.</p>
    <p>After the first Covid-19 case was de­tected in Wuhan, China, in early Jan­uary, it took about 15 weeks to reach two mil­lion cases. By con­trast, it took just eight days to climb above 15 mil­lion from the 13 mil­lion reached on July 13.</p>
    <p>With the first wave of the virus yet to peak in sev­eral coun­tries and a resur­gence of cases in oth­ers, some coun­tries are rein­tro­duc­ing strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, while oth­ers are re­lax­ing re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Global coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions surged past 15 mil­lion yesterday, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, with the pan­demic gath­er­ing pace even as coun­tries re­main di­vided in their re­sponse to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In the United States, which has the high­est num­ber of cases in the world with 3.91 mil­lion in­fec­tions, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump warned: “It will prob­a­bly, un­for­tu­nately, get worse be­fore it gets bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The top five coun­tries with the most cases are rounded out by Brazil, India, Rus­sia and South Africa.</p>
    <p>The Reuters tally shows that the dis­ease is ac­cel­er­at­ing the fastest in the Amer­i­cas, which ac­count for more than half of the world’s in­fec­tions and half of its deaths.</p>
    <p>But wor­ry­ing trends of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion are emerg­ing in South­ern Europe and in the Balkan re­gion, Dr Mike Ryan, head of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) emer­gen­cies pro­gramme, said yesterday.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously the Amer­i­cas is clearly still the ma­jor hot spot – North, Cen­tral and South Amer­ica – but we have dis­ease be­gin­ning to ac­cel­er­ate in Africa,” Dr Ryan told New­stalk ra­dio sta­tion in his na­tive Ire­land.</p>
    <p>“Also, even in Europe, while cer­tainly in West­ern Europe the dis­ease has come un­der con­trol, we still have some wor­ry­ing trends in South­ern Europe and the Balkans so we’re not out of the woods just yet in the Euro­pean en­vi­ron­ment. It re­quires sus­tained vig­i­lance.”</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the rate of new in­fec­tions shows no sign of slow­ing, ac­cord­ing to the Reuters tally, based on of­fi­cial re­ports. After the first Covid-19 case was de­tected in Wuhan, China, in early Jan­uary, it took about 15 weeks to reach two mil­lion cases. By con­trast, it took just eight days to climb above 15 mil­lion from the 13 mil­lion reached on July 13.</p>
    <p>Health experts stress that of­fi­cial data al­most cer­tainly un­der-re­ports both in­fec­tions and deaths, par­tic­u­larly in coun­tries with lim­ited test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases at 15,107,017 is at least triple the num­ber of se­vere in­fluenza ill­nesses recorded an­nu­ally, ac­cord­ing to WHO data, while the death toll of more than 616,000 in seven months is close to the up­per range of yearly in­fluenza deaths.</p>
    <p>With the first wave of the virus still to peak in sev­eral coun­tries and a resur­gence of cases in oth­ers, some coun­tries are rein­tro­duc­ing strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures while oth­ers re­lax re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Stung by low ap­proval rat­ings for his han­dling of the pan­demic and down­play­ing of the risks dur­ing the early stages, Mr Trump made a sig­nif­i­cant shift in rhetoric on Tues­day, en­cour­ag­ing Amer­i­cans to wear face masks.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic wors­ened in</p>
    <p>the US, Mr Trump’s fo­cus ahead of a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber has been on re­open­ing the econ­omy, and gov­er­nors in the hard-hit states of Texas, Florida and Ge­or­gia con­tinue to push back hard against calls for stricter re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In Brazil, more than 2.15 mil­lion peo­ple have tested pos­i­tive in­clud­ing Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, and more than 81,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>India, the only other coun­try with more than one mil­lion cases, re­ported al­most 40,000 new cases yesterday. Hav­ing been keen to re­open its econ­omy, India is now fac­ing the twin chal­lenge of com­bat­ing the pan­demic and mas­sive flood­ing in the coun­try’s north-east.</p>
    <p>Two min­is­ters in South Africa’s Cab­i­net were ad­mit­ted to hospi­tal with Covid-19, as Africa’s most in­dus­tri­alised coun­try counted a to­tal of 372,628 con­firmed cases and 5,173 deaths.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries, such as Spain and Aus­tralia, are rein­tro­duc­ing re­stric­tions in re­sponse to fresh out­breaks.</p>
