    <p>The re­sale condo mar­ket reached a two-year high last month with 1,509 units chang­ing hands, ac­cord­ing to flash fig­ures from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It trumped the 1,311 trans­ac­tions recorded in Au­gust, which had the high­est monthly re­sale vol­ume since May 2018.</p>
    <p>The sales fig­ure from last month rep­re­sented a 21.6 per cent jump from the 1,241 units resold in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The vol­ume of resold units trans­acted last month was also 72.9 per cent higher than that in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to SRX data, over­all prices of re­sale con­dos rose by 0.8 per cent from Septem­ber to last month, with month-on-month price growth across all three re­gions.</p>
    <p>Prices for the core cen­tral re­gion (CCR) rose by 0.5 per cent, the rest of cen­tral re­gion (RCR) by 1 per cent and out­side cen­tral re­gion (OCR) by 0.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Siew Ying, PropNex’s head of re­search and con­tent, said that trans­ac­tions of re­sale units last month were driven mainly by sales of mass-mar­ket homes, which ac­counted for 58 per cent of the to­tal vol­ume.</p>
    <p>Brisk sales in the pri­vate condo re­sale mar­ket seem to be broadly in line with the pri­vate new home sales mar­ket and the Hous­ing Board re­sale seg­ment, re­flect­ing a “healthy un­der­ly­ing de­mand for homes”, she said.</p>
    <p>“Sales have been rel­a­tively brisk in re­cent months as buy­ers en­ter the mar­ket, sens­ing that the worst may be over and tak­ing con­fi­dence from the grad­u­ally re­cov­er­ing econ­omy. Bar­gain hunters would also be on the prowl, search­ing the re­sale mar­ket for good-value buys amid the eco­nomic down­turn,” she added.</p>
    <p>The high­est trans­acted price last month was for a re­sale unit at Wal­lich Res­i­dence in Tan­jong Pa­gar, which was sold for $62 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The su­per pent­house in Sin­ga­pore’s tallest build­ing was pre­vi­ously owned by Bri­tish bil­lion­aire in­ven­tor James Dyson, who pur­chased the unit a year ago for a re­ported $73.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The high­est trans­acted price in the RCR was $9.1 mil­lion for a unit in Re­flec­tions at Kep­pel Bay in Har­bourFront while a unit in Costa Del Sol, off Up­per East Coast Road, resold for $2.9 mil­lion, the high­est price in the OCR.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, ERA Realty re­search and con­sul­tancy head Ni­cholas Mak said the re­cov­ery seen in the re­sale condo mar­ket in the past three months is “just the be­gin­ning”.</p>
    <p>He noted that Demo­crat Joe Bi­den’s win in the re­cent United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion would likely ben­e­fit a trade-de­pen­dent coun­try such as Sin­ga­pore and aid in its eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, would likely have a pos­i­tive im­pact on the real es­tate mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, the re­cent ad­vances by phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies in the de­vel­op­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines could also grad­u­ally im­prove in­vest­ment sen­ti­ments, which would spill over to the real es­tate mar­ket,” he added.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Last month, the high&#xAD;est trans&#xAD;acted price in the rest of cen&#xAD;tral re&#xAD;gion (RCR) was $9.1 mil&#xAD;lion for a unit in Re&#xAD;flec&#xAD;tions at Kep&#xAD;pel Bay in Har&#xAD;bourFront. Ac&#xAD;cord&#xAD;ing to&#xD;&#xA;SRX data, prices of re&#xAD;sale con&#xAD;dos in RCR rose by 1 per cent from Septem&#xAD;ber to last month.</p>
