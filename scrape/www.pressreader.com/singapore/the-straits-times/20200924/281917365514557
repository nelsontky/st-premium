    <p>BANGKOK • Hun­dreds of Thai roy­al­ists marched to Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day to op­pose calls from anti-government pro­test­ers for changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion as the assem­bly met to con­sider amend­ing it.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial ses­sion of Par­lia­ment was con­vened af­ter nearly two months of protests – the big­gest of which drew tens of thou­sands of peo­ple at the week­end in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers are seek­ing to change a Con­sti­tu­tion that they say was en­gi­neered to en­sure former j unta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha stayed on as prime min­is­ter af­ter l ast year’s election.</p>
    <p>They are de­mand­ing his de­par­ture, with some pro­test­ers also say­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion gives too much power to King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>The 2017 Con­sti­tu­tion was writ­ten by a mil­i­tary-ap­pointed com­mit­tee and passed a na­tion­wide ref­er­en­dum in 2016 at which op­po­si­tion cam­paign­ing was banned.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has said the 2019 election was fair.</p>
    <p>Mr Warong Dechgitvi­grom, who led the march to Par­lia­ment by the roy­al­ist Thai Pakdee group, said he had sub­mit­ted a pe­ti­tion with 130,000 sig­na­tures op­pos­ing con­sti­tu­tional change.</p>
    <p>“To amend the 2017 Con­sti­tu­tion, an­other na­tion­wide ref­er­en­dum must be done,” Mr Warong told Reuters. “Noth­ing good would come out of this amend­ment. It will only ben­e­fit politi­cians.”</p>
    <p>The group’s move came af­ter Thai le­gal watch­dog group iLaw on Tues­day sub­mit­ted a char­ter draft to Par­lia­ment for con­sid­er­a­tion ear­lier yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But the Par­lia­ment sec­re­tary said that draft, backed by over 100,000 sig­na­tures, would not be con­sid­ered this week be­cause the sig­na­tures must be ver­i­fied first.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment will de­cide to­day what part of the Con­sti­tu­tion will be amended and how. Anti-government pro­test­ers plan to rally out­side the Par­lia­ment build­ing to ap­ply pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The Thai Par­lia­ment is made up of an elected Lower House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, in which Mr Prayut’s back­ers in­creased their ma­jor­ity af­ter a ban on a ma­jor op­po­si­tion party early this year.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the Se­nate, Par­lia­ment’s Up­per House, were all se­lected by Mr Prayut’s former junta.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Thai­land’s Par­lia­ment im­posed max­i­mum se­cu­rity at its premises ahead of the protest to­day.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives So­rasak Pien­vej said an open space had been set aside for demon­stra­tors to stage their protests.</p>
    <p>He also al­layed fears that the protest may get out of hand, say­ing he­li­copters will be em­ployed to evac­u­ate par­lia­men­tar­i­ans and of­fi­cials if nec­es­sary.</p>
