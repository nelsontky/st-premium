    <p>BRUS­SELS • Johnson & Johnson (J&J) could pro­duce one bil­lion doses of its po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine next year if it proves suc­cess­ful and would con­sider in­ject­ing healthy vol­un­teers with the coro­n­avirus if there are not enough pa­tients for fi­nal tri­als, a com­pany ex­ec­u­tive said.</p>
    <p>J&J kicked off early-stage hu­man safety tri­als last month for its po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine af­ter re­leas­ing de­tails of a study in mon­keys that showed its best-per­form­ing can­di­date of­fered strong pro­tec­tion in a sin­gle dose. It is de­vel­op­ing the vac­cine in col­lab­o­ra­tion with its Bel­gian sub­sidiary, Janssen.</p>
    <p>Large-scale tri­als are set to start by the be­gin­ning of Oc­to­ber and J&J aims to have re­sults on the vac­cine’s ef­fi­cacy be­tween the end of this year and the mid­dle of next year, Mr Jo­han Van Hoof, head of vac­cines at Janssen, told Reuters on Tues­day in a tele­phone in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Tues­day, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin said his coun­try had be­come the first to grant reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to a Covid-19 vac­cine af­ter less than two months of hu­man test­ing and be­fore largescale tri­als had been con­ducted.</p>
    <p>Dr Van Hoof said pro­duc­tion of the vac­cine had al­ready be­gun de­spite the fi­nan­cial risks in­volved, to make sure it would be avail­able as soon as pos­si­ble should it prove ef­fec­tive against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral mil­lion doses will be ready by the be­gin­ning of next year, with a to­tal ca­pac­ity of one bil­lion shots by the end of the year, he said. He added that the com­pany was likely to favour a sin­gle-jab ap­proach, al­though a fi­nal de­ci­sion on whether a booster would be needed had not yet been made.</p>
    <p>Out­comes of large-scale, or Phase III, tri­als will de­pend on t he in­ci­dence of in­fec­tions, he said, with faster re­sults ex­pected with higher virus trans­mis­sion. That is why J&J is likely to con­duct those tri­als in the United States and Latin Amer­ica, the re­gions with the high­est num­ber of cases cur­rently.</p>
    <p>If in­fec­tions drop sig­nif­i­cantly, J&J is also con­sid­er­ing so-called chal­lenge tri­als, in which vol­un­teers are in­fected with the virus so that a vac­cine can­di­date can be tested on them.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing into that pos­si­bil­ity,” Dr Van Hoof said, not­ing though that such tri­als posed eth­i­cal is­sues that needed to be re­solved be­fore they could be con­ducted. For in­stance, an ef­fec­tive ther­apy against the dis­ease should be avail­able to min­imise risks for vol­un­teers ex­posed to the virus.</p>
    <p>Separately, the US has en­tered an agree­ment with drug­maker Moderna to ac­quire 100 mil­lion doses of its po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine for around US$1.5 bil­lion (S$2.06 bil­lion), the com­pany and White House said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The US in re­cent weeks has made deals to ac­quire hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses of po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cines from sev­eral com­pa­nies as part of its Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed pro­gramme, which aims to de­liver a vac­cine in the coun­try by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s price per dose comes to around US$30.50 a per­son for a two-dose reg­i­men. With the ex­cep­tion of its deal with As­traZeneca, which of­fered a lower price per drug i n ex­change for up­front re­search and de­vel­op­ment costs, all the deals price the vac­cines at be­tween US$20 and US$42 for a two-dose course of treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s vac­cine can­di­date, mRNA-1273, is one of the few that have ad­vanced to the fi­nal stage of test­ing and is on track to be com­pleted next month, it said.</p>
