    <p>Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust (CMT) saw a big drop in rental in­come aris­ing from the rental waivers of $74.1 mil­lion granted to ten­ants af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic, as well as lower gross turnover rent and carpark in­come dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, its man­ager said in a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yesterday.</p>
    <p>This led dis­tri­bu­tion per unit (DPU) to fall 27.7 per cent to 2.11 cents for its sec­ond quar­ter ended June 30, from 2.92 cents a year ago.</p>
    <p>Gross rev­enue was down 39.8 per cent to $114.1 mil­lion for the sec­ond quar­ter, from $189.5 mil­lion a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Net prop­erty in­come (NPI) al­most halved to $68.1 mil­lion for the quar­ter, from $133.2 mil­lion in the year-ago pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Distributa­ble in­come de­clined 27.5 per cent year on year to $78.1 mil­lion, from $107.7 mil­lion. This in­cluded the re­lease of $23.2 mil­lion, or one-third of the $69.6 mil­lion tax­able distributa­ble in­come re­tained in the first quar­ter of this year, the man­ager said.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion will be paid out on Aug 28, after books clo­sure on</p>
    <p>July 30.</p>
    <p>For the half year ended June 30, DPU was lower at 2.96 cents, ver­sus 5.8 cents a year ago, and distributa­ble in­come fell 48.7 per cent to $109.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, gross rev­enue fell 16.7 per cent to $318.4 mil­lion, while NPI eased 20.8 per cent to $216.4 mil­lion for the half year.</p>
    <p>In view of the “chal­leng­ing” op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment due to the pan­demic, CMT has re­tained $46.4 mil­lion of its tax­able distributa­ble in­come for the first half of this year, its man­ager said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, cap­i­tal dis­tri­bu­tion of $4.8 mil­lion for the pe­riod from Aug 14 to Dec 31 last year, re­ceived from Cap­i­taLand Re­tail China Trust (CRCT) in the first quar­ter of this year, had been re­tained for gen­eral cor­po­rate and work­ing cap­i­tal pur­poses.</p>
    <p>As at June 30, CMT owns a 10.9 per cent stake in CRCT.</p>
    <p>In the first half of last year, CMT had re­tained $9.2 mil­lion of its tax­able distributa­ble in­come for fis­cal 2019.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal dis­tri­bu­tion and tax-ex­empt in­come dis­tri­bu­tion of $5.9 mil­lion re­ceived from CRCT in the first quar­ter of last year had also been re­tained for gen­eral cor­po­rate and work­ing cap­i­tal pur­poses, CMT’s man­ager added.</p>
    <p>CMT units closed un­changed at $2.02 yesterday.</p>
