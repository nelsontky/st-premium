    <p>China has a new cap­i­tal­ist role model, and it is not Alibaba founder Jack Ma. The laud­ing of pi­o­neer­ing 19th-cen­tury cap­i­tal­ist Zhang Jian as a pa­tri­otic en­tre­pre­neur and phi­lan­thropist is re­veal­ing of the Com­mu­nist Party’s cur­rent pre­oc­cu­pa­tions, says Fi­nan­cial Times Bei­jing bu­reau chief</p>
    <p>Tom Mitchell.</p>
    <p>Zhang Jian, a pi­o­neer­ing 19th-cen­tury cap­i­tal­ist, has been brought back to life many times by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist party since his death in 1926, de­pend­ing on its pro­pa­ganda needs.</p>
    <p>But his lat­est rein­car­na­tion, as a pa­tri­otic na­tion builder and phi­lan­thropist, marks his high­est pro­file reap­pear­ance yet, cham­pi­oned by no less a com­mu­nist pu­ri­tan than Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Last month, Mr Xi, who has em­pha­sised the party’s cen­tral­ity in all as­pects of life in con­tem­po­rary China, vis­ited Zhang’s home­town of Nan­tong, a Yangtze river port 100km north of Shang­hai. He toured a mu­seum founded by Zhang – China’s first – and re­viewed an ex­hi­bi­tion about the life of the famed en­tre­pre­neur.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi vis­ited Nan­tong just nine days af­ter reg­u­la­tors halted what would have been the world’s big­gest ever ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) – by Alibaba founder Jack Ma’s Ant Group – and a fort­night af­ter the party’s Cen­tral Com­mit­tee for­mally placed “self-re­liance” at the heart of China’s long-term de­vel­op­ment strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing pro-party blog­ger and com­men­ta­tor Sima Nan said Mr Xi’s mes­sage to Mr Ma, China’s rich­est man with a for­tune es­ti­mated at US$59 bil­lion (S$79 bil­lion), was clear: if Ant’s US$37 bil­lion IPO had pro­ceeded, the on­line lender would have boasted a big­ger mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion than even state-owned In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China, the coun­try’s big­gest bank.</p>
    <p>“Ma is rich, has starred in films, con­ducted or­ches­tras and crit­i­cised reg­u­la­tors,” Mr Sima said, re­fer­ring to some of the bil­lion­aire’s celebrity ex­ploits and an Oct 24 speech that an­gered Mr Xi, who then or­dered reg­u­la­tors to sus­pend the Ant IPO.</p>
    <p>“Zhang Jian built fac­to­ries and founded over 370 schools. Ant poses sys­temic risks. It is im­por­tant to see how both men made their money and how they spent it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Xi said Zhang was a “sage and role model” for China’s en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>“When you see a vir­tu­ous per­son, fol­low his ex­am­ple,” he added, call­ing on China’s pri­vate-sec­tor busi­ness lead­ers to “strengthen their feel­ings for the coun­try and as­sume so­cial re­spon­si­bil­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Mr Ma de­clined to com­ment. The In­ter­net ty­coon’s char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tion, which fo­cuses on ed­u­ca­tion and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, was val­ued at US$4.6 bil­lion and had dis­trib­uted US$300 mil­lion by the end of last year. Mr Ma has also pledged 2 per cent of Ant’s shares to char­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi had first men­tioned Zhang at a July meet­ing with busi­ness peo­ple. “Out­stand­ing en­trepreneur­s must have a strong sense of mis­sion and re­spon­si­bil­ity for the na­tion, and align their en­ter­prise’s de­vel­op­ment with the pros­per­ity of the na­tion and the hap­pi­ness of the peo­ple,” he told them. “Zhang was a model pa­tri­otic en­tre­pre­neur.”</p>
    <p>As a young man, Zhang aced the Qing dy­nasty’s ex­ams for scholar of­fi­cials, giv­ing him en­tree into elite im­pe­rial cir­cles. With state sup­port, he founded a suc­cess­ful tex­tile group and other en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>He was also sym­pa­thetic to re­formist move­ments that as­pired to mod­ernise China so it could hold its own against a newly in­dus­tri­alised Ja­pan and the Euro­pean colo­nial pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Notre Dame his­to­rian Elis­a­beth Koll, who has writ­ten a book about Zhang, notes that in con­tem­po­rary por­traits, he ap­peared as com­fort­able in tra­di­tional Qing scholar out­fits as he did in the west­ern busi­ness suits pre­ferred by mod­ern re­form­ers of the era.</p>
    <p>“He was some­body who was very clever at mov­ing back and forth be­tween two worlds,” Pro­fes­sor Koll said. “I would char­ac­terise him as a con­ser­va­tive who, dur­ing a re­ally dif­fi­cult and messy time, wanted sta­bil­ity and peace­ful de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>While Zhang was not an ac­tive par­tic­i­pant in the rev­o­lu­tion­ary un­der­ground that helped pre­cip­i­tate the Qing dy­nasty’s col­lapse in 1911, he suc­cess­fully nav­i­gated the political tur­bu­lence, end­ing up a min­is­ter in China’s first but short-lived repub­li­can gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Dis­il­lu­sioned by the chaos of repub­li­can China, which quickly gave way to a frac­tured era dom­i­nated by re­gional war­lords, Zhang re­treated to Nan­tong, where he wielded enor­mous power.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Qin Shao, who teaches mod­ern Chi­nese his­tory at the Col­lege of New Jer­sey, ar­gued that this made Zhang a prob­lem­atic fig­ure for Mr Xi. China’s Pres­i­dent has made it clear that true pa­tri­ots must also love the party and fol­low its dic­tates. Chi­nese pro-democ­racy ac­tivists, most no­tably in Hong Kong, have cat­e­gor­i­cally re­jected the no­tion that coun­try and party are one and the same.</p>
    <p>“Zhang went his sep­a­rate way and built Nan­tong as a lo­cal, in­de­pen­dent and self-gov­ern­ing model for the rest of China,” said Prof Shao. “If any­thing, he pro­vides an ex­cel­lent ex­am­ple of sep­a­rat­ing the political regime and the coun­try, and serv­ing the in­ter­ests of the coun­try in­stead of the regime.”</p>
    <p>The ways in which the party has por­trayed Zhang over the years say as much about the com­mu­nists as they do about Zhang.</p>
    <p>In the 1980s and 1990s, when Deng Xiaop­ing was en­cour­ag­ing mar­ket-ori­ented re­forms, Zhang was cel­e­brated for his cap­i­tal­ist in­no­va­tions, such as found­ing China’s first share­hold­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>“The party sees what it wants to see in Zhang Jian, de­pend­ing on where eco­nomic poli­cies and re­forms stand,” Prof Koll said.</p>
    <p>“The way he was por­trayed</p>
    <p>(dur­ing Deng’s rule) made per­fect sense with the first wave of eco­nomic re­forms, and now there is this whole fo­cus on pa­tri­o­tism.”</p>
    <p>By con­trast, she added, Zhang was vil­i­fied dur­ing the Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion as a “blood­suck­ing cap­i­tal­ist and ex­ploiter of the work­ing class – the usual story”.</p>
    <p>But in Mr Xi’s China, the party prefers to over­look Zhang’s de­served rep­u­ta­tion as a tough fac­tory boss, whose largely ru­ral work­force could be sent back to their nearby farms when or­ders slowed.</p>
    <p>“Zhang Jian sets an ex­am­ple,” Mr Sima said. “When en­trepreneur­s get rich they should love the coun­try more, rather than move money out of China then come back to make more.”</p>
