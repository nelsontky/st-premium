    <p>Just a few sea­sons ago, the streetwear craze peaked and the pen­du­lum swung back to­wards a more dressed-up sen­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>This was man­i­fested as an up­dated take on 1980s power dress­ing: boxy jack­ets, state­ment shoul­ders, Wall Street suit­ing, all codes bor­rowed from mas­cu­line con­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Who could for­get that sem­i­nal mo­ment when the Democrats took back the United States House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives in 2018 and all its new fe­male mem­bers showed up in white pantsuits for their swearingin?</p>
    <p>For the long­est time, for a woman to tele­graph power and se­ri­ous­ness, it seemed that she had to re­nounce the sig­ni­fiers of fem­i­nin­ity.</p>
    <p>When was the last time a man in a po­si­tion of power was ques­tioned over his hair, shoes or the colour of his suit?</p>
    <p>Well, no more. This sea­son, some of the most in­tel­li­gent, in­ven­tive fe­male de­sign­ers work­ing today have de­cided to re­claim the tropes tra­di­tion­ally as­so­ci­ated with fem­i­nin­ity and re­align them with an im­age of strength.</p>
    <p>Frills, rib­bons, vol­ume, fringe, bead­ing, the colour pink – these all fea­tured heav­ily in some of the most ex­cit­ing col­lec­tions of the sea­son. And the way they came off was far from twee, pre­cious or girl­ish. These were women – proud, strong and un­apolo­get­i­cally fem­i­nine.</p>
    <p>The most strik­ing re­al­i­sa­tion of that vi­sion hap­pened at Fendi, where both the run­way and most of the col­lec­tion came in a del­i­cate shade of blush, but the women were any­thing but.</p>
    <p>They wore a lot of lin­gerie, and dresses in lace and vel­vet – many with beaded tas­sels – but the over­all vibe was more femme fa­tale than damsel i n dis­tress. These were clothes built for the wearer’s plea­sure, not the male gaze.</p>
    <p>Cre­ative di­rec­tor Sil­via Ven­turini Fendi em­pha­sised her em­brace of pow­er­ful wom­an­hood by putting the clothes on an age­and size-di­verse cast.</p>
    <p>The su­per­mod­els of a pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tion – Karen El­son, Liya Kebede and Carolyn Mur­phy – looked es­pe­cially ar­rest­ing, hard­won lines, curves and all in their fit­ted dresses traced with the im­print of corsetry.</p>
    <p>Ven­turini Fendi also high­lighted the beauty of the fuller fig­ure through Jill Kortleve in a bustier dress and Paloma Elsesser’s but­ter­cup tai­lor­ing.</p>
    <p>“I wanted a fem­i­nine at­ti­tude, but women have so many facets and I wanted to rep­re­sent them all. That’s why I chose to have a cast of dif­fer­ent women that don’t an­swer to a pre­fixed idea of the ideal woman – that to me does not ex­ist,” says Ven­turini Fendi on her in­clu­sive cast­ing.</p>
    <p>As for the col­lec­tion it­self, the de­signer wanted to twist that fem­i­nin­ity on its head.</p>
    <p>“The start­ing point was ex­plor­ing the old codes that have been dic­tat­ing fem­i­nine wardrobes for decades, and op­pos­ing them to new codes that rep­re­sent today. I started from the big­gest cliche: pink, be­cause ‘pink is for girls’. But the women I dress are pow­er­ful, strong and free,” she says of her driv­ing im­pulse.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Mi­lan, her fel­low vi­sion­ary Mi­uc­cia Prada was also toy­ing with what she called the “cliches of fem­i­nin­ity and the con­trasts be­tween what it is per­ceived to be”.</p>
    <p>On the run­way, the cliches and con­trasts came fast and fu­ri­ous: A skirt of fine, swish­ing fringe was worn with a sharply tailored blazer, crisp shirts and ties were paired with sheer or­ganza skirts, chunky cosy knits were em­bel­lished with jet bead­ing, high-tech ny­lon was sculpted into old-school cou­ture shapes, and sports jer­seys were elon­gated into neo-flap­per dresses.</p>
    <p>In Prada’s hands, all the things once viewed as signs of friv­o­lous fem­i­nin­ity were re­con­tex­tu­alised and given new mean­ing.</p>
    <p>Here, glam­our is not a dirty word. “Glam­our is some­thing that makes you op­ti­mistic – it lifts you up,” says the de­signer.</p>
    <p>Right in the mid­dle of her show space was a card­board statue of At­las lift­ing the world.</p>
    <p>Prada sur­rounded it with a dif­fer­ent vi­sion of strength: her pa­rade of women, look­ing glam­orously wom­anly and ready to take on the world.</p>
    <p>“At­las was a man who car­ried the world on his shoul­ders. Women have to deal with the light­ness of life. This is my way of say­ing you can be strong and fem­i­nine at the same time.”</p>
    <p>Prada was not the only one ru­mi­nat­ing on the strength to be found in the fem­i­nine this sea­son.</p>
    <p>The equally in­tel­lec­tual but more es­o­teric Rei Kawakubo also found her­self fas­ci­nated by the con­ven­tion and tropes of fem­i­nin­ity.</p>
    <p>The Queen of Black opened her lat­est Comme des Gar­cons show with a burst of hot pink and fol­lowed that up with a se­ries of bul­bous looks with ex­ag­ger­ated curves that brought to mind a cer­tain yonic sug­ges­tion, am­pli­fied by the scale to which she blew them up.</p>
    <p>Most of these were topped with gi­ant lace head­dresses, fur­ther al­lud­ing to and sub­vert­ing a kind of fem­i­nin­ity that has been de­picted all through­out fash­ion and art his­tory.</p>
    <p>Lace was also on the mind of Kawakubo’s former pro­tege Chi­tose Abe.</p>
    <p>Her lat­est Sa­cai col­lec­tion was dis­tinctly dressier and more stream­lined than pre­vi­ous out­ings, and while she opened and closed the show with menswear-cen­tric looks, right in the mid­dle was a pair of out­fits that stood out for the graphic in­ter­play be­tween the mas­cu­line and the fem­i­nine – and the grace and strength that ten­sion ex­uded.</p>
    <p>Two white lace blouses – one trail­ing a one-sided silk train – were worn with satin opera gloves and slouchy black tuxedo trousers; the bride and the groom in one look, per­fectly en­cap­su­lat­ing the con­stant pur­suit of du­al­ity that Abe has made a cor­ner­stone of her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Com­bin­ing the fierce with the fiercely fem­i­nine has al­ways been at the core of what Sarah Bur­ton does at Alexan­der McQueen.</p>
    <p>Her lat­est col­lec­tion, which she called “a love let­ter to women”, was in­spired by Celtic tra­di­tions and folk­lore, but the end re­sult was thor­oughly mod­ern.</p>
    <p>Ra­zor-sharp suit­ing found its coun­ter­point in dresses that ex­ploded in pleats and ruf­fles – both look­ing equally com­mand­ing.</p>
    <p>“The woman is coura­geous, grounded, bold, heroic,” says Bur­ton of the char­ac­ter she had in mind.</p>
    <p>Pale pink – a colour she lifted from tra­di­tional Welsh pet­ti­coats – was trans­ferred onto fig­ure-ac­cen­tu­at­ing coats and dresses.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Bur­ton played up com­fort and com­mu­nity – qual­i­ties as­so­ci­ated with the ma­ter­nal and the sis­terly.</p>
    <p>“There is a sense of pro­tec­tion in the clothes, of safety and com­fort, evoked through quilt­ing and blan­kets,” she says. “The hearts are a sym­bol of to­geth­er­ness, of be­ing there for oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Fash­ion may love to say that it no longer sees gen­der, but the truth of the mat­ter is that gen­der codes are still heav­ily loaded with cen­turies of pre­con­ceived no­tions.</p>
    <p>It is ex­hil­a­rat­ing to see some of the most bril­liant de­sign­ers today re­claim­ing these codes and im­bu­ing them with new mean­ing.</p>
