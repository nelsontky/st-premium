    <p>From next Jan­uary, the num­ber of own­ers a proxy can rep­re­sent at gen­eral meet­ings for col­lec­tive sales will be re­stricted, said the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) yesterday.</p>
    <p>This is among changes to the Land Ti­tles (Strata) Act to en­cour­age own­ers to par­tic­i­pate in per­son and min­imise the risk of proxy abuse.</p>
    <p>Proxy hold­ers will be lim­ited to rep­re­sent­ing own­ers of no more than 2 per cent of the to­tal num­ber of lots in a strata de­vel­op­ment, or two lots, which­ever is higher.</p>
    <p>There is cur­rently no re­stric­tion on the num­ber of own­ers a proxy may rep­re­sent.</p>
    <p>The proxy giver will also be able to ex­plic­itly di­rect his proxy to vote as he in­tended, added MinLaw in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>An owner of a strata-ti­tled prop­erty may ap­point a proxy to at­tend and vote on pro­pos­als sub­mit­ted at meet­ings for col­lec­tive sales. The proxy can also vote on an owner’s be­half on the elec­tion of mem­bers of the col­lec­tive sale com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Mak, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at ERA Realty, said the changes will be pos­i­tive for the col­lec­tive sale process.</p>
    <p>There have been in­stances where those with strong mo­ti­va­tion to vote one way or the other at such meet­ings per­suade their fel­low strata ti­tle own­ers to give them their proxy votes, he said.</p>
    <p>Th­ese par­ties could gather sig­nif­i­cant numbers of proxy votes and in­flu­ence the sale process in a way that may run counter to the proxy givers’ wishes, he added.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, MinLaw said that real-time elec­tronic vot­ing will be an op­tion for some meet­ings such as gen­eral meet­ings of com­pa­nies, char­i­ties and reg­is­tered so­ci­eties amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This op­tion kicks in from to­mor­row and will also ap­ply for in­sol­vency- and bank­ruptcy-re­lated meet­ings.</p>
    <p>While vot­ing elec­tron­i­cally is al­ready pre­scribed for gov­ern­ing board meet­ings for some or­gan­i­sa­tions, the min­istry said do­ing so in real time is not yet pro­vided for as an al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ment for most meet­ings.</p>
    <p>MinLaw said this op­tion can be ex­er­cised as long as cer­tain pre­scribed safe­guards are adopted and the en­tity still al­lows at­ten­dees to vote by ap­point­ing the chair­man or con­venor as their proxy to vote.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments for meet­ings and who to con­tact for in­quiries can be found at https://go.gov.sg/al­ter­na­tive­meet­ings</p>
