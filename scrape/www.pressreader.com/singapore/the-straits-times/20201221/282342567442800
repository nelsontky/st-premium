    <p>Three young re­searchers work­ing in the ar­eas of med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, gene ther­apy and can­cer bi­ol­ogy were recog­nised last Fri­day for their sci­en­tific en­deav­ours.</p>
    <p>They re­ceived the Young Sci­en­tist Award from Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing at the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Academy of Science and sup­ported by the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star), the award recog­nises the ac­com­plish­ments of re­searchers un­der 35 who have shown strong po­ten­tial to be world-class ex­perts in their cho­sen fields.</p>
    <p>AS­SIS­TANT PRO­FES­SOR JOHN HO, 31</p>
    <p>Af­ter smart­phones and smart watches, Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor John Ho be­lieves smart cloth­ing could be the next game changer.</p>
    <p>He is part of a team that de­vel­oped a smart­phone-pow­ered suit that is able to track a per­son’s tem­per­a­ture, pos­ture and move­ments, po­ten­tially help­ing clin­i­cians bet­ter un­der­stand pa­tients who face chronic back pain and, in turn, pro­vide in­sights for di­ag­no­sis and treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the early stages of the Covid-19 pan­demic, Prof Ho, who is prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor at the NUS In­sti­tute for Health In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy, had also lever­aged wire­less med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy to en­hance di­ag­no­sis of pos­si­ble in­fec­tions in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>One pos­si­ble symp­tom of Covid-19 is low blood oxy­gen.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem de­vel­oped by Prof Ho and his col­leagues utilises Blue­tooth-en­abled pulse oxime­ters to mea­sure blood oxy­gen lev­els, and can com­pile pulse oxime­ter read­ings from thou­sands of in­di­vid­u­als neatly on a dash­board.</p>
    <p>Prof Ho said: “Wire­less health­care tech­nolo­gies have shown enor­mous prom­ise in trans­form­ing the way that we man­age chronic con­di­tions like di­a­betes and obe­sity – the next step will be to ad­dress chal­lenges like rig­or­ous clin­i­cal tests and how to guar­an­tee pa­tient pri­vacy.”</p>
    <p>DR CHEW WEI LEONG, 35</p>
    <p>Dr Chew Wei Leong, a se­nior re­search sci­en­tist at A*Star’s Genome In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore, lever­aged a gene-edit­ing tool known as Crispr-Cas, which works like ge­netic scis­sors, po­ten­tially snip­ping out un­wanted seg­ments of hu­man ge­netic ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>“Un­like tra­di­tional medicines such as small-mol­e­cule drugs that we take as pills, these Crispr-based nu­cleic acid ther­a­peu­tics go straight to the DNA and per­form molec­u­lar surgery on it,” Dr Chew said.</p>
    <p>“This means that Crispr-Cas ed­its our genes and per­ma­nently fixes the ge­netic dis­eases at the root causes.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Our work opens up treat­ment av­enues to dis­eases that af­fect mul­ti­ple or­gans.”</p>
    <p>Dr Chew’s team is now work­ing on how to make the process safer. “This is im­por­tant be­cause our work will re­duce the se­vere risks of un­de­sired im­mune re­ac­tions to these po­tent medicines,” he added.</p>
    <p>DR TAN SI HUI, 35</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Si Hui, a can­cer bi­ol­o­gist, wants to use her ex­per­tise and knowl­edge to de­velop novel can­cer treat­ments.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who pre­vi­ously worked at A*Star, had been part of a team which made a break­through dis­cov­ery that iden­ti­fies and iso­lates stem cells lead­ing to stom­ach can­cer.</p>
    <p>The pro­tein aqua­porin-5 (AQP5), which is pro­duced by stom­ach stem cells, can be used as a bi­o­log­i­cal marker for de­vel­op­ing treat­ments for dis­eased and can­cer­ous stom­achs.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who now heads the re­search team at lo­cal biotech­nol­ogy start-up Car­gene Ther­a­peu­tics, said: “I hope to make an im­pact on pa­tients by de­vel­op­ing drugs or plat­forms that can re­store their health, either through more ef­fi­ca­cious treat­ments or more ac­cu­rate ther­a­peu­tic rec­om­men­da­tions.”</p>
