    <p>Hong Kong po­lice have is­sued ar­rest war­rants for six prom­i­nent pro-democ­racy fig­ures who are now over­seas, main­land me­dia re­ported, just days after at least a dozen op­po­si­tion can­di­dates were dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning for the city’s Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The six are al­leged to have breached Hong Kong’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law, by in­cit­ing se­ces­sion and col­lud­ing with for­eign forces, the me­dia re­ported on Fri­day, the same day the gov­ern­ment de­cided to post­pone the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) elec­tion to Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>This is the first time the au­thor­i­ties have in­voked the law’s ex­trater­ri­to­rial ju­ris­dic­tion to go after ac­tivists not in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Democ­racy cam­paigner and United States cit­i­zen Sa­muel Chu, who runs the Hong Kong Democ­racy Coun­cil in Wash­ing­ton, is one of those tar­geted.</p>
    <p>Mr Chu said on Fri­day that ex­ile and for­eign na­tion­al­ity are no pro­tec­tion against the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong po­lice is tar­get­ing a</p>
    <p>US cit­i­zen for lob­by­ing my own gov­ern­ment. I might be the first non-Chi­nese cit­i­zen to be tar­geted, but I will not be the last,” he said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“If I am tar­geted, any Amer­i­can, any cit­i­zen of any na­tion who speaks out for HK can – and will be – too,” he added.</p>
    <p>The other five who were is­sued ar­rest war­rants are dis­qual­i­fied law­maker and key for­mer mem­ber of the now-de­funct De­mo­sisto party Nathan Law, for­mer Bri­tish con­sulate staff mem­ber Si­mon Cheng, and ac­tivists Ray Wong, Wayne Chan and Hon­c­ques Laus.</p>
    <p>Mr Law, who is in Britain, said in a Face­book post on Fri­day that he had no idea what his “crime” was and de­scribed the al­le­ga­tions as “trumped-up charges”.</p>
    <p>He de­clared that his ad­vo­cacy work over­seas was of his own ini­tia­tive and con­ducted with­out col­lab­o­ra­tion with oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Since leav­ing Hong Kong, I have also stopped con­tact­ing mem­bers of my fam­ily. From now on, I’ll sever my re­la­tion­ship with them,” Mr Law wrote, adding that the ar­rests, dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tions and wanted bul­letins “are in­di­ca­tions of our need to re­main ac­tive on the global stage”.</p>
    <p>“That Hong Kong has no place for even such mod­er­ate views like ours un­der­scores the ab­sur­dity of Chi­nese com­mu­nist rule,” said Mr Law.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who was granted asy­lum in Ger­many last year, said on Twit­ter that he had an­nounced in</p>
    <p>May last year that he no longer sup­ported Hong Kong in­de­pen­dence and that he has not dis­cussed this topic with any for­eign diplo­mats since the na­tional se­cu­rity law kicked in on July 1.</p>
    <p>“So the only rea­son why I was sought for ‘in­cite­ment to se­ces­sion and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces’ must be based on my ac­tiv­i­ties before the NSL (na­tional se­cu­rity law) was in force. To­day, the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment un­veils the fact that they’d use the law ret­ro­spec­tively,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who once led pro-in­de­pen­dence group Hong Kong Indige­nous, had skipped bail after be­ing charged in con­nec­tion with the 2016 Mong Kok riot.</p>
    <p>The riot, the first in Hong Kong in nearly four decades, re­sulted in Mong Kok going into vir­tual lock­down in Fe­bru­ary 2016.</p>
    <p>So far, sev­eral coun­tries have sus­pended their ex­tra­di­tion treaties with Hong Kong, in­clud­ing Britain, Aus­tralia and, most re­cently, Ger­many, as a pos­si­ble safe­guard against at­tempts to use the na­tional se­cu­rity law to round up ac­tivists abroad.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan, a pro-in­de­pen­dence ac­tivist, was cited by Reuters as say­ing from an undis­closed lo­ca­tion that “the sit­u­a­tion faced by Hong Kongers is even more dan­ger­ous than what I face”.</p>
    <p>Since the law kicked in, a dozen lead­ing pro-democ­racy cam­paign­ers, in­clud­ing ac­tivist Joshua Wong, have been dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning for Legco for their pre­vi­ously stated po­lit­i­cal views, while four stu­dents aged be­tween 16 and 21 were ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of “in­cit­ing suc­ces­sion” on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Wong has said the reasons given by elec­tion of­fi­cials to bar him from run­ning in the Legco poll were “ridicu­lous”, and ac­cused them of twist­ing his views so they could pros­e­cute him un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Wong, who is fac­ing charges for links to protests last year, blasted the ban as “the most scan­dalous elec­tion fraud ever in Hong Kong his­tory” and one that is po­lit­i­cally charged.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment an­nounc­ing its de­ci­sion, the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment listed crit­i­cis­ing Bei­jing’s new se­cu­rity law, cam­paign­ing to win a leg­is­la­tion-blocking ma­jor­ity and re­fus­ing to recog­nise China’s sovereignt­y as in­stances of po­lit­i­cal views that re­quire dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Before this, four stu­dents ac­cused of or­gan­is­ing and in­cit­ing se­ces­sion­ist ac­tiv­i­ties were ar­rested on Wed­nes­day un­der the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Se­cu­rity Depart­ment said the sus­pects were in­volved in post­ing on an on­line plat­form that sup­ported a “Hong Kong na­tion” and that they had de­clared their in­ten­tion to use all means nec­es­sary to achieve this end and to unite all pro-in­de­pen­dence groups in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>WON’T BE THE LAST</p>
    <p>If I am tar­geted, any Amer­i­can, any cit­i­zen of any na­tion who speaks out for HK can – and will be – too. ’’</p>
    <p>MR SA­MUEL CHU</p>
    <p>OP­PRES­SIVE RULE</p>
    <p>That Hong Kong has no place for even such mod­er­ate views like ours un­der­scores the ab­sur­dity of Chi­nese com­mu­nist rule. ’’</p>
    <p>MR NATHAN LAW</p>
