    <p>About 8,300 stroke cases were ad­mit­ted to pub­lic hos­pi­tals here in 2018, up 5 per cent from 2017, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est data from the Sin­ga­pore Stroke Reg­istry.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, around one in four adults over the age of 25 will suf­fer a stroke in their life­time. But the ma­jor­ity of these cases – 80 per cent – can be pre­vented through life­style mod­i­fi­ca­tions. If the stroke is spotted early and emer­gency treat­ment is done quickly, com­pli­ca­tions can also be re­duced.</p>
    <p>This month, the Stroke Ser­vice Im­prove­ment (SSI) team will be reach­ing out to the pub­lic in places such as the lift lob­bies of Hous­ing Board blocks, by mail­ing res­i­dents, and by hav­ing a larger so­cial me­dia out­reach to raise aware­ness about stroke pre­ven­tion and de­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The SSI is a na­tional team ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Health in 2014 to over­see and im­ple­ment ini­tia­tives to im­prove stroke care.</p>
    <p>This three-month drive is an ex­ten­sion of last year’s ver­sion, which had the tagline: Be Stroke Smart, Be OK: Spot Stroke. Stop Stroke.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Dei­dre Anne de Silva, chair of the SSI and a se­nior con­sul­tant neu­rol­o­gist at the Na­tional Neu­ro­science In­sti­tute, said: “The im­por­tant mes­sage re­mains that one should seek ur­gent treat­ment when any one sign of stroke is spotted, re­gard­less of sever­ity. So, stroke ed­u­ca­tion must not stop.”</p>
    <p>Warn­ing signs of stroke in­clude face and arm weak­nesses, as well as speech dif­fi­culty.</p>
    <p>Given the Covid-19 out­break, the out­reach cam­paign will be con­ducted with the re­quired safe man­age­ment mea­sures, the SSI said yes­ter­day. Dig­i­tal plat­forms will also be a stronger fo­cus this year, with ini­tia­tives tar­get­ing all age groups.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, to ed­u­cate se­niors, SSI will or­gan­ise on­line getai shows cen­tred on the theme Be Stroke Smart on Nov 5, fea­tur­ing pop­u­lar getai artists and hosted by Lin Ru Ping. Bite-size in­for­ma­tion used to iden­tify com­mon symp­toms of stroke will be con­veyed in an en­ter­tain­ing man­ner.</p>
    <p>The getai per­for­mances will be live-streamed on the Spot Stroke Face­book page and the LEX-S Watch Live Chan­nel’s plat­form.</p>
    <p>Stroke ed­u­ca­tion is also be­ing ex­tended to chil­dren, who can help spread the mes­sage to the rest of the fam­ily, es­pe­cially their grand­par­ents.</p>
    <p>An ac­tion hero sto­ry­book will be launched for young read­ers, while a se­ries of interactiv­e e-books, games and an­i­ma­tions is avail­able on https://sg-en.fas­theroes.com/ to ed­u­cate chil­dren about stroke in a fun and interactiv­e man­ner.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual sto­ry­telling ses­sion, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Na­tional Li­brary Board, will be held on Oct 25.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic can reg­is­ter for it on https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/save -the-world-with-the-fast-heroes­reg­is­tra­tion-1198756041­59</p>
    <p>More de­tails on the cam­paign ini­tia­tives can be found on the Spot Stroke Face­book page.</p>
