    <p>ROME • Pope Francis has said same-sex cou­ples should be pro­tected by civil union laws in the clear­est lan­guage he has used on the rights of gay peo­ple, prompt­ing praise from lib­er­als and calls for ur­gent clar­i­fi­ca­tion from con­ser­va­tives.</p>
    <p>He made his com­ments in a new doc­u­men­tary Francesco, by Os­carnom­i­nated di­rec­tor Evgeny Afi­neevsky, that was re­leased on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“Ho­mo­sex­ual peo­ple have a right to be in a fam­ily. They are chil­dren of God and have a right to a fam­ily. No­body should be thrown out or be made mis­er­able over it,” he said. “What we have to cre­ate is a civil union law. That way they are legally cov­ered. I stood up for that,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Pope ap­peared to be re­fer­ring to when he was arch­bishop of Buenos Aires and op­posed leg­is­la­tion to ap­prove same-sex mar­riages but sup­ported some kind of le­gal pro­tec­tion for gay cou­ples’ rights.</p>
    <p>The Catholic Church teaches that ho­mo­sex­ual ten­den­cies are not sin­ful but ho­mo­sex­ual acts are. It teaches that ho­mo­sex­u­als should be treated with dig­nity but is op­posed to gay mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Pa­pal bi­og­ra­pher Austen Ivereigh told Reuters that the Pope’s com­ments in the film were some of the clear­est lan­guage the pontiff has used on the sub­ject since his elec­tion in 2013.</p>
    <p>“Pope Francis’ clear and public sup­port for same-sex civil unions marks a new stage in the Church’s re­la­tion­ship with LGBTQ peo­ple,” said Fa­ther James Martin, a Je­suit priest and au­thor of Build­ing A Bridge, a book about Catholic min­istry to ho­mo­sex­u­als. “It shows his over­all pas­toral ap­proach to LGBTQ peo­ple, in­clud­ing those who are Catholic, and sends a clear mes­sage to those bish­ops and church lead­ers who have op­posed such laws,” Mr Martin told Reuters. LGBTQ stands for les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tives have de­manded a clar­i­fi­ca­tion. “The Pope’s state­ment clearly con­tra­dicts what has been the long­stand­ing teach­ing of the Church about same-sex unions. The Church can­not sup­port the ac­cep­tance of ob­jec­tively im­moral re­la­tion­ships,” Prov­i­dence’s Bishop Thomas Tobin said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Vat­i­can and China yes­ter­day re­newed a deal on the ap­point­ment of bish­ops in China and the Vat­i­can promised to push the com­mu­nist govern­ment to al­low more free­dom of re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>The ac­cord gives the Pope the fi­nal say over the ap­point­ment of Chi­nese bish­ops, and the Chi­nese govern­ment will al­low all of them, in­clud­ing those hail­ing from a state­backed Church, to recog­nise the Pope’s au­thor­ity.</p>
