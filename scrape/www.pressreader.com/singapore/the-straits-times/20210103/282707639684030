    <p>Mr Christo­pher Tan’s ob­ses­sion with in­dex funds started more than a decade ago. He liked the funds not only be­cause of their lower costs, but also be­cause he saw that most ac­tively man­aged funds do not per­form bet­ter than av­er­age re­turns of the mar­kets. Thus, in­dex funds gen­er­ally are bet­ter placed to out­per­form ac­tively man­aged funds.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS AN IN­DEX</p>
    <p>For in­stance, The Straits Times In­dex (STI) com­prises 30 con­stituent stocks with fa­mil­iar names such as the big lo­cal banks, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and other well-known com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“If the Sin­ga­pore stock mar­ket goes up, then your fund will go up. If it comes down, your fund will come down. There are many in­dex funds around the world that track dif­fer­ent in­dexes, such as the S&P 500 etc, so in sim­ple terms that’s what ac­tu­ally an in­dex fund is all about.”</p>
    <p>What about ex­change-traded funds or ETFs? Buy­ing an ETF is akin to buy­ing a listed stock, but in this case, this “stock” is essen­tially a bas­ket of in­dex stocks.</p>
    <p>“When you buy one share of the ETF, you ac­tu­ally own a bas­ket of these stocks from the in­dex,” Mr Tan ex­plained. “So an ETF is ac­tu­ally a very good way of in­vest­ing be­cause the costs are even lower than an in­dex fund.”</p>
    <p>HOW TO BUY</p>
    <p>“You can buy an ETF that tracks the United States S&P 500 from the Sin­ga­pore stock mar­ket. But it is not very liq­uid and what that means is that when you want to buy and sell, it takes a bit more time to get it traded and the cost can be higher.</p>
    <p>In­vestors can also buy the S&P 500 from the US mar­ket, but they have to be will­ing to put up with trad­ing in a dif­fer­ent time zone and also deal with the tax im­pli­ca­tions of buy­ing an ETF that’s traded in the US. It’s not rocket science, but you need to have an interest and need to do a lit­tle bit of home­work. You need to open a stock­broking ac­count.”</p>
    <p>MAN­AGED VS IN­DEX FUNDS</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Mr Tan, the two things in­vestors should be wary about when in­vest­ing in funds are track­ing er­ror and costs. He reck­ons that the ad­van­tage of in­vest­ing in in­dex funds is that in­vestors do not have to worry whether fund man­agers are pick­ing the right stocks to beat the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“You don’t re­ally have to worry too much about track record be­cause their track record is the mar­ket. They’re not try­ing to beat the in­dex, but if you buy an ac­tively man­aged fund that tries to beat the mar­ket, you’ve got to see who is the man­ager manag­ing it.”</p>
    <p>“The other thing that you have to be aware of is the cost. If you are buy­ing those very ex­pen­sive unit trusts and in­vest­ment-linked poli­cies that Sin­ga­pore­ans love to buy, you are look­ing at an at least 1.5 per cent man­age­ment fee. So if you com­pare 0.2 per cent with 1.5 per cent, the dif­fer­ence is your re­turn.”</p>
    <p>Re­tail in­vestors buy­ing ETFs don’t need a fund man­ager. All they need to do is open a stock­broking ac­count.</p>
    <p>“So you just need to have a bro­ker and you can buy off the ex­change through the bro­ker if you are buy­ing an ETF. But again, I just want to ad­vise lis­ten­ers to be care­ful and be mind­ful of tax is­sues such as es­tate duty tax, with­hold­ing tax etc. So do your home­work, and don’t just buy off any ex­change,” Mr Tan said.</p>
