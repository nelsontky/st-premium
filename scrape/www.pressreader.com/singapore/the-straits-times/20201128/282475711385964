    <p>Say you are a com­pany pro­duc­ing mut­ton curry in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With the newly signed Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) trade pact, you can buy ingredient­s such as mut­ton and curry paste from 14 other coun­tries and still have the fi­nal can or packet of the dish count as made in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This will be more cost-ef­fec­tive for two rea­sons.</p>
    <p>First, the ingredient­s bought from the other RCEP coun­tries are con­sid­ered to be orig­i­nat­ing in Sin­ga­pore when de­ter­min­ing their ori­gins to en­joy pref­er­en­tial tar­iffs.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, per­ish­able goods can be cleared by Cus­toms as swiftly as within six hours of ar­rival .</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will also be able to en­joy cheaper mut­ton curry when the cost sav­ings are passed on to them.</p>
    <p>This cas­cade of ben­e­fits is an ex­am­ple of how RCEP – the world’s largest trade pact, inked on Nov 15 – will im­pact busi­nesses and con­sumers here.</p>
    <p>In­volv­ing the 10 Asean mem­bers, plus China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and New Zealand, the RCEP cov­ers nearly one-third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion and con­trib­utes around 30 per cent of the world’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>One of its key achieve­ments is that it elim­i­nates tar­iffs for about 92 per cent of goods traded among the mem­bers.</p>
    <p>A SIN­GLE RULE</p>
    <p>But the big­gest ben­e­fit for Sin­ga­pore is the pres­ence of a sin­gle rule for each prod­uct that ap­plies across all 15 par­ties to the RCEP, said Ms Su­laimah Mah­mood, the chief RCEP ne­go­tia­tor at the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, dif­fer­ent coun­tries had dif­fer­ent rules, she added. “If you ex­ported to South Korea, there was one rule; if you ex­ported to Ja­pan, there was an­other.”</p>
    <p>Each of Asean’s trade agree­ments has dif­fer­ent rules of ori­gin.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if a com­pany in Viet­nam makes a bi­cy­cle, it may be el­i­gi­ble for pref­er­en­tial mar­ket ac­cess un­der a trade deal with Ja­pan, but may need dif­fer­ent com­po­nents or manufactur­ing process to be el­i­gi­ble un­der a deal with South Korea.</p>
    <p>“We thought: What would be the best way to con­sol­i­date the rules so that it’s eas­ier for our com­pa­nies?”</p>
    <p>Be­sides a sin­gle rule, there is also the cu­mu­la­tion of rules of ori­gin, which sets out how much re­gional con­tent a prod­uct must have be­fore it can en­joy lower tar­iffs.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the RCEP was con­cluded, many busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore could tap only the ex­ist­ing Asean Plus One free trade agree­ments (FTAs) or the trade agree­ments be­tween the 10-mem­ber re­gional bloc and in­di­vid­ual di­a­logue part­ners such as Ja­pan, South Korea and China.</p>
    <p>Now, RCEP has thrown the door wide open. Busi­nesses can source in­puts from any of the 14 other RCEP mem­bers, said Ms Su­laimah.</p>
    <p>FOOD, AU­TO­MO­TIVE SEC­TORS TO BEN­E­FIT MOST</p>
    <p>While RCEP al­lows for broader sourc­ing by com­pa­nies, pref­er­en­tial tar­iffs are likely no bet­ter than those al­ready on of­fer un­der other FTAs, like the Asean Plus One FTAs, said PwC’s Asian World­trade Man­age­ment Ser­vices man­ag­ing part­ner Frank De­bets.</p>
    <p>BEN­E­FITS FOR SMES</p>
    <p>The RCEP would seem to be ben­e­fi­cial to SMEs, as the dig­i­tal econ­omy still presents SMEs with sig­nif­i­cant bar­ri­ers for cross-bor­der trade. Thus, these pro­vi­sions, if ac­tu­ally im­ple­mented, would be very good for Sin­ga­pore’s fin­tech, clean tech, lo­gis­tics and other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>MR ALEX CAPRI, vis­it­ing se­nior fel­low at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Business School.</p>
    <p>“Only if com­pa­nies re­quire broader cu­mu­la­tion of orig­i­nat­ing ma­te­ri­als, or if they trade ex­ten­sively be­tween Ja­pan and China or Korea, would the RCEP likely be of more sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fit to them.”</p>
    <p>China, Ja­pan, and South Korea have been try­ing to reach their own tri­lat­eral FTA for years.</p>
    <p>Mr De­bets added that in­dus­tries with tra­di­tion­ally higher rates of Cus­toms du­ties, such as food and agri­cul­ture, au­to­mo­tives and con­sumer elec­tron­ics, stand to ben­e­fit the most.</p>
    <p>But each com­pany will need to do its own home­work to de­ter­mine the ex­act ben­e­fits, which tend to be prod­uct-spe­cific and not in­dus­try-spe­cific, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Alex Capri, vis­it­ing se­nior fel­low at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Business School, said mem­bers have made im­pres­sive com­mit­ments around e-com­merce, dig­i­tal ser­vices, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty (IP) pro­tec­tion, dis­pute set­tle­ment and other ar­eas crit­i­cal to dig­i­tal trade.</p>
    <p>These are ar­eas that align with Sin­ga­pore’s ob­jec­tives to be a global hub for the knowl­edge and dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The RCEP would seem to be ben­e­fi­cial to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), as the dig­i­tal econ­omy still presents SMEs with sig­nif­i­cant bar­ri­ers for cross-bor</p>
    <p>der trade,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Thus, these pro­vi­sions, if ac­tu­ally im­ple­mented, would be very good for Sin­ga­pore’s fin­tech, clean tech, lo­gis­tics and other sec­tors.”</p>
    <p>BUILD­ING AWARE­NESS AMONG BUSI­NESSES</p>
    <p>PwC’s Mr De­bets, how­ever, cau­tioned that RCEP may not be top of mind for busi­nesses be­cause it is still sub­ject to rat­i­fi­ca­tion, and it may take more than a year be­fore the pact takes ef­fect.</p>
    <p>“Judging by ex­pe­ri­ence, it may mean that com­pa­nies don’t see the ur­gency and for­get about the agree­ment, even when it does ul­ti­mately come into force,” he said.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment will take ef­fect after six Asean na­tions and three non-Asean coun­tries rat­ify it.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Business Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Meng Kit said busi­nesses could start by re­view­ing their ex­ist­ing sup­ply sources and con­sid­er­ing new mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“Those in ser­vices trade should also take a crit­i­cal look at RCEP’s more lib­eral ser­vices mar­ket ac­cess com­mit­ments, e-com­merce pro­vi­sions and IP pro­tec­tion clauses to iden­tify op­por­tu­ni­ties where they can gain a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage in this fast-grow­ing re­gion,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the fed­er­a­tion is plan­ning a se­ries of out­reach ac­tiv­i­ties, starting next month, on the ben­e­fits of the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The business devel­op­ment direc­tor of food mar­keter, im­porter and dis­trib­u­tor San SeSan, Mr Gary Lee, said his com­pany, in an­tic­i­pa­tion of RCEP, has re­aligned its sup­ply chain to mit­i­gate the im­pact of the United States-China trade war.</p>
    <p>It aims to tap RCEP to ex­port to Ja­pan and South Korea un­der lower or no du­ties, and also to ex­pand into the Chi­nese mar­ket, he added.</p>
    <p>“Our joint ven­ture fac­tory based in Thai­land ex­panded its ca­pac­ity in a shift away from US-ori­gin goods, so that we can avoid the high im­port du­ties on US prod­ucts to China.</p>
    <p>“Con­versely, we ob­serve that many China-ori­gin prod­ucts are sim­i­larly starting to shift to fac­to­ries in Asean to sup­port ex­ports to the US.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee also hopes that RCEP will strengthen IP, to counter what he ob­serves has been a pro­lif­er­a­tion of Chi­nese com­pa­nies reg­is­ter­ing un­re­lated trade­marks that are sim­i­lar to ex­ist­ing brands.</p>
