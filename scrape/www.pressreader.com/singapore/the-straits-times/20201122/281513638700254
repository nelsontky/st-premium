    <p>The road to re­cov­ery for Sin­ga­pore’s be­lea­guered nightlife in­dus­try will be a long one, a Sun­day Times poll has shown, with most re­spon­dents stat­ing that they will not pa­tro­n­ise es­tab­lish­ments such as karaoke out­lets and night­clubs dur­ing a planned pi­lot pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot to re­open se­lected es­tab­lish­ments with strict mea­sures in place – such as manda­tory mask wear­ing while singing and danc­ing – is meant to boost the bat­tered in­dus­try. It will be­gin at se­lected bars and pubs from next month and will wi­den to in­clude cer­tain karaoke out­lets and night­clubs from Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>But read­ers who took part in last week’s on­line poll said they find the safe man­age­ment mea­sures that must be in place at th­ese es­tab­lish­ments to be too “re­stric­tive” or “trou­ble­some”, and that they will be de­terred by them.</p>
    <p>Of the 402 re­spon­dents who took part in the poll, 62 per cent in­di­cated they would not visit a karaoke out­let and 73 per cent said they would stay away from night­clubs.</p>
    <p>Views on vis­it­ing bars and pubs – which will be sub­ject to less strin­gent rules – were mixed, with about 35 per cent of re­spon­dents say­ing they would pa­tro­n­ise the busi­nesses and an­other 18 per cent re­spond­ing with a “maybe”.</p>
    <p>Many re­spon­dents took is­sue with the manda­tory Covid-19 tests, among other mea­sures. Pa­trons must pro­duce a neg­a­tive test, good for the 24 hours be­fore the end of their karaoke or club­bing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>This was also the least pop­u­lar mea­sure among re­spon­dents.</p>
    <p>About 71 per cent said they would not take the tests.</p>
    <p>About 47 per cent of those polled also said the cost of the test should be shared be­tween the Govern­ment, busi­nesses and con­sumers, with re­sponses vary­ing in the con­fig­u­ra­tion of such a cost-shar­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Condi Koh, 35, said she would not take the Covid-19 test just to pa­tro­n­ise the busi­nesses be­cause she is afraid that the test would cause her dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh, who works in sales, also said she would not pa­tro­n­ise the busi­nesses as she does not trust other pa­trons to stick to the rules.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the in­flu­ence of soft light­ing, mu­sic and al­co­hol... you’ll feel very com­fort­able, and once you feel very com­fort­able, you’ll tend to for­get all the rules.”</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial trader W.K. Teo, 35, said he would take the test to fre­quent night­clubs and bars he used to go to. He sees the test as the “new nor­mal go­ing for­ward”, much like how peo­ple must be tested for Covid-19 to travel overseas.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he sees the cost of the test as a po­ten­tial prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“I feel that ei­ther the Govern­ment or the busi­nesses should cover (the cost of) the tests, and def­i­nitely not the cus­tomer. If you ask the cus­tomers to pay for the tests, they will pre­fer not to go to th­ese premises,” said Mr Teo.</p>
    <p>Like oth­ers, he also ques­tioned the need for the manda­tory wear­ing of masks and the ban on al­co­hol sales af­ter 10.30pm, which he felt were un­nec­es­sary mea­sures af­ter one has tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But health­care ex­perts said the ad­di­tional mea­sures are a must.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, said a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test does not guar­an­tee that a per­son is in­fec­tion-free, since the virus has an in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod dur­ing which a per­son can test neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>He also said there is al­ways the pos­si­bil­ity of a false neg­a­tive re­sult.</p>
    <p>“Un­til there is a fool­proof way of mak­ing sure ev­ery sin­gle per­son at a karaoke out­let or a night­club is not in­fected, mea­sures such as mask wear­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing will need to re­main as a pre­cau­tion, es­pe­cially since we know such ac­tiv­i­ties and set­tings are ex­tremely risky, in terms of the ease of in­fect­ing and the like­li­hood of in­fect­ing many at the same time,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>Nightlife busi­nesses The Sun­day Times spoke to said they un­der­stood the need for the mea­sures, but noted that it is still dif­fi­cult for their busi­nesses to be vi­able with such strict rules in place.</p>
    <p>Ms Francesca Way, co-founder of A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive which owns retro bars and clubs, said her team has de­cided not to ap­ply for the pi­lot pro­gramme, and will pro­ceed with plans to move into the food and bev­er­age sec­tor in­stead.</p>
    <p>“The fi­nan­cial risks and un­cer­tainty for op­er­a­tors are high. Go­ing for the pi­lot means we lose out on the up to $50,000 pivot grant (and po­ten­tially bet­ter rev­enue as the rules are less re­stric­tive),” said Ms Way, adding that there is still no con­crete idea of what will hap­pen af­ter the pi­lot ends.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Joseph Ong em­pha­sised that the safe man­age­ment mea­sures are not meant to be per­ma­nent, and would be re­vised, scaled down or lifted when the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion here im­proves.</p>
    <p>He added that he hopes the mea­sures would give cus­tomers peace of mind, know­ing that they are in safe en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Jean Teo, direc­tor of pop­u­lar karaoke chain Teo Heng KTV Stu­dio, said her team made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to ap­ply for the pi­lot, as they felt they must do their part and help keep the in­dus­try afloat.</p>
    <p>She plans to set up pop-up booths at se­lected out­lets for pa­trons to do the tests, and said she would wait for the Govern­ment’s sug­ges­tion on who should bear the cost of the tests.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Teo: “As long as we are able to, we are go­ing to go all the way to hang on.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Karaoke out&#xAD;lets, such as Cash Stu&#xAD;dio in Clarke Quay Cen&#xAD;tral (above, left) and Teo Heng KTV Stu&#xAD;dio in Ren&#xAD;dezvous Ho&#xAD;tel, have re&#xAD;mained closed as part of Covid-19 mea&#xAD;sures.
