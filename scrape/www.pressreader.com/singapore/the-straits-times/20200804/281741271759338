    <p>NEW YORK • Dr Deb­o­rah Birx, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s coro­n­avirus co­or­di­na­tor, said on Sun­day that the United States was in a “new phase” of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that was much more sprawl­ing across the coun­try than last spring’s out­breaks in ma­jor cities such as New York and Seat­tle.</p>
    <p>She rec­om­mended that peo­ple liv­ing in com­mu­ni­ties where cases are surg­ing to wear a mask at home if they live with some­one who is es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble be­cause of age or un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“What we are see­ing to­day is... ex­traor­di­nar­ily wide­spread,” she said on CNN’s State of the Union news pro­gramme. “It is into the ru­ral as equal ur­ban ar­eas. So, ev­ery­body who lives in a ru­ral area, you are not im­mune.”</p>
    <p>Dr Birx stressed the sig­nif­i­cance of asymp­to­matic trans­mis­sion, and said the White House coro­n­avirus task force was work­ing to make sure Amer­i­cans in af­fected com­mu­ni­ties un­der­stood this risk.</p>
    <p>“If you have an outbreak in your ru­ral area or in your city, you need to re­ally con­sider wear­ing a mask at home, as­sum­ing that you are pos­i­tive if you have in­di­vid­u­als in your home with co-mor­bidi­ties” such as res­pi­ra­tory prob­lems or di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Dr Birx said that in her re­cent trav­els, she had seen “all of Amer­ica mov­ing”, mak­ing it dou­bly im­por­tant for peo­ple to un­der­stand the risks. In­fected peo­ple with­out symp­toms can un­wit­tingly seed nu­mer­ous chains of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“If you have cho­sen to go on va­ca­tion into a hot spot, you re­ally need to come back and as­sume you are in­fected,” she said. “By the time you wait for some­one to come for­ward to the emer­gency room, you have wide­spread com­mu­nity spread.”</p>
    <p>In some com­mu­ni­ties see­ing re­cent out­breaks, house­hold trans­mis­sion has been a huge fac­tor, say pub­lic health ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Both Dr Birx and Ad­mi­ral Brett Giroir, an as­sis­tant sec­re­tary at the US Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices, em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of pre­ven­tion meth­ods, such as large-scale mask-wear­ing, hand wash­ing, and avoid­ing crowded in­door spa­ces and mass so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>On NBC’s Meet the Press pro­gramme on Sun­day, Adm Giroir said the ef­forts seemed to be help­ing in re­cent weeks to re­duce cases in Ari­zona, Texas and Florida, which have been hard-hit this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>He re­peat­edly pointed to maskwear­ing as per­haps the sin­gle most ef­fec­tive preven­tive mea­sure.</p>
    <p>“Wear­ing a mask is in­cred­i­bly im­por­tant, but we have to have like 85 per cent or 90 per cent of in­di­vid­u­als wear­ing a mask and avoid­ing crowds,” he said. “That es­sen­tially gives you the same out­come as a com­plete shut­down.”</p>
    <p>Asked if he was rec­om­mend­ing a na­tional mask man­date, Adm Giroir said: “The pub­lic health mes­sage is we have got to have mask-wear­ing.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t do that and if we don’t limit the in­door crowded spa­ces, the virus will con­tinue to run.”</p>
    <p>Global coro­n­avirus cases sur­passed 18 mil­lion yes­ter­day as the pan­demic now adds one mil­lion in­fec­tions around every four days, with flare-ups prompt­ing more lock­downs around the world.</p>
