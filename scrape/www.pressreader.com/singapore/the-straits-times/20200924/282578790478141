    <p>ENOLA HOLMES</p>
    <p>One of the clever­est things the movie Sher­lock Holmes: A Game Of Shad­ows (2011) did was cast co­me­dian Stephen Fry as My­croft – the older, smarter and fun­nier brother of Robert Downey Jr’s Sher­lock.</p>
    <p>The film Enola Holmes has a sim­i­lar gam­bit, Enola be­ing the way­ward teenage sis­ter of Sher­lock, played here by Henry Cav­ill (Jus­tice League, 2017), who is very much the sec­ond banana in this fun and frothy story.</p>
    <p>Based on a se­ries of six young-adult nov­els, it has Enola nar­rat­ing the story of her un­con­ven­tional up­bring­ing by mother Eu­do­ria, who, be­ing ec­cen­tric and English, must nec­es­sar­ily be played by He­lena Bon­ham Carter (Alice In Won­der­land, 2010).</p>
    <p>Eu­do­ria, a closet fem­i­nist, has raised a Re­nais­sance woman who can fight as well as she thinks – which comes in handy when Enola wakes up on her 16th birth­day to find that her beloved mum has van­ished.</p>
    <p>Broth­ers Sher­lock and My­croft (Sam Claflin from 2016’s Me Be­fore You) try to pack Enola off to fin­ish­ing school, but she runs away to look for her mother in London, which means Sher­lock now has two miss­ing rel­a­tives to chase down.</p>
    <p>But the big­ger ad­ven­ture is Enola’s. We see her be­friend­ing a hand­some aris­to­crat, leap­ing from trains, fend­ing off as­sas­sins and even­tu­ally foil­ing a con­spir­acy to sub­vert Bri­tish democ­racy.</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tive gives Enola plenty of wins, but if you think too hard about the ac­tual sleuthing she does, some of it is not that im­pres­sive, un­less solv­ing ana­grams and puz­zles floats your boat.</p>
    <p>What the movie has in spades, how­ever, is charm. There are nods to themes such as women’s rights, but these are ba­si­cally there to ser­vice a pop­corn movie – one with just enough com­edy, ac­tion and ro­mance to fill two hours.</p>
    <p>Brown talks di­rectly to the cam­era, a la Fleabag, and while the script does not do as much as it could with this fourth-wall break­ing, it is pleas­antly con­spir­a­to­rial.</p>
    <p>This might be the most in­ven­tive Sher­lock Holmes spin-off since the tele­vi­sion show El­e­men­tary (2012 to last year) with Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, and it is a wel­come ad­di­tion to the fran­chise.</p>
    <p>LONG WAY UP</p>
    <p>You don’t have to be a mo­tor­cy­cle en­thu­si­ast to en­joy Long Way Up, the third trav­el­ogue fol­low­ing ac­tor Ewan McGre­gor (the Star Wars pre­quels, 1999 to 2005) as he zips across the globe on two wheels.</p>
    <p>In 2004’s Long Way Round, he biked from London to New York via Siberia; and in 2007’s Long Way Down, tra­versed the length of Africa to get from Scot­land to Capetown.</p>
    <p>He was ac­com­pa­nied by best friend and fel­low Bri­ton Charley</p>
    <p>Boor­man for both and the pair re­united for this trip, which took them from Patag­o­nia in Ar­gentina all the way to Los An­ge­les in the United States.</p>
    <p>In the coro­n­avirus era, all the frus­trated trav­ellers make for a large cap­tive au­di­ence for this kind of show.</p>
    <p>But un­like most travel se­ries, this one leans heav­ily on the long­stand­ing friend­ship and chem­istry of its hosts.</p>
    <p>The duo had lost touch since their 2007 jaunt, but Boor­man’s near-fa­tal road ac­ci­dent in 2016 brought them back to­gether.</p>
    <p>If you buy into this rekin­dled-friend­ship and blokey-bro­mance hook, it makes the se­ries very watch­able.</p>
    <p>It does take a while to get go­ing, though. This re­viewer knows next to noth­ing about mo­tor­cy­cles, but the first thing you learn here is that the rich can have pretty much any ve­hi­cle gut­ted and in­stalled with an elec­tric en­gine.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion is taken to do so in this third se­ries with elec­tric-pow­ered Har­ley-David­son bikes, which feels rather gim­micky.</p>
    <p>You could ar­gue it raises the pro­file of elec­tric mo­tor­bikes, which we are told man­u­fac­tur­ers have been slow to warm up to.</p>
    <p>And it gave elec­tric-ve­hi­cle start-up Ri­vian a chance to put the tech­nol­ogy through its paces while run­ning the gamut on road con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Yet the car­bon foot­print of the lo­gis­tics ef­fort sup­port­ing all this must have been con­sid­er­able. It meant hav­ing two Ri­vian elec­tric trucks shadow McGre­gor and Boor­man, and in­stalling more than 100 charg­ing sta­tions along the 20,000km route.</p>
    <p>Still, there is a rhythm to a long, lan­guid road trip with old friends that the se­ries cap­tures beau­ti­fully, and if you are able to tune into that fre­quency, this is your kind of travel show.</p>
