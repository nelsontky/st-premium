    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • As the Stan­ley Cup was be­ing passed around by his Tampa Bay Light­ning team­mates, cap­tain Steven Stamkos strug­gled to find the words.</p>
    <p>The Light­ning have been among Cup favourites for the past few years, but they kept fall­ing short.</p>
    <p>The worst ex­am­ple oc­curred last year, when, de­spite be­ing the farand-away reg­u­lar-sea­son cham­pi­ons, they were swept aside by the Colum­bus Blue Jack­ets in the open­ing round of the play-offs.</p>
    <p>A sea­son later, the Light­ning are atop the hockey world, hav­ing claimed the Cup with a 2-0 vic­tory over the Dal­las Stars on Mon­day to clinch the best-of-seven series 4-2.</p>
    <p>“I’m so proud of this team and ev­ery­thing we’ve ac­com­plished. I’m speech­less,” Stamkos, who was able to play only one pe­riod dur­ing the series ow­ing to in­jury, said on the CBC broad­cast. “It’s one of the great­est feel­ings in the world.”</p>
    <p>Coach Jon Cooper said the 2019 post­sea­son taught his team what it took to win. “Some­times in fail­ure you find suc­cess,” he said. “I truly believe the heart­break we suf­fered brought us here to­day.”</p>
    <p>The Light­ning’s ti­tle run cul­mi­nated an un­prece­dented 11-month 2019-20 sea­son that was sus­pended on March 12 due to the Covid-19 pan­demic be­fore re­sum­ing on Aug 1 in a quar­an­tine bub­ble in Ed­mon­ton and Toronto, Canada.</p>
    <p>Tampa Bay, who won the Cup for the se­cond time in fran­chise history, rode a 22-save shutout by goal­tender An­drei Vasilevski­y.</p>
    <p>Goals by Bray­den Point and Blake Cole­man pro­vided enough of­fence against a Stars team who sim­ply could not match up.</p>
    <p>Point opened the scor­ing 12:23 into the first pe­riod. The Light­ning won ev­ery play-off game in which he lit the lamp. He led all Na­tional Hockey League play­ers in goals dur­ing this post­sea­son, edg­ing out Dal­las’ Joe Pavel­ski (13).</p>
    <p>The Stars man­aged only four shots on goal in each of the first two pe­ri­ods, a tes­ta­ment to the Light­ning’s strong de­fen­sive play. Dal­las man­aged to gen­er­ate an at­tack dur­ing the third pe­riod, but Vasilevski­y blocked all 14 shots that came his way.</p>
    <p>At the other end, Stars’ An­ton Khu­dobin made 27 saves, but it was not enough.</p>
