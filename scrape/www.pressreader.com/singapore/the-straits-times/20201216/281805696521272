    <p>TOKYO • Sam­ples of dust col­lected by a Ja­panese space probe from an as­teroid some 300 mil­lion km from Earth were bet­ter than hoped for, with one re­searcher say­ing he was l ost for words when they opened the cap­sule for the first time.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples, the cli­max of a sixyear space odyssey to the Ryugu as­teroid by the space probe Hayabusa2, ar­rived in Ja­pan last week but re­searchers did not know for sure un­til this week if they had ac­tu­ally got any­thing.</p>
    <p>“We were aim­ing for 100mg or more, and we def­i­nitely got that,” said Mr Hiro­taka Sawada at the Ja­pan Space Ex­plo­ration Agency (JAXA), who said he was speech­less when he first saw the sam­ple.</p>
    <p>“I think that next I prob­a­bly screamed, I don’t re­ally re­mem­ber,” he told a news con­fer­ence. “It was re­ally dif­fer­ent from what I ex­pected, there was a fair amount.”</p>
    <p>As­teroids are be­lieved to have formed at the dawn of the solar sys­tem, and sci­en­tists have said the sam­ple may con­tain or­ganic mat­ter that could have con­trib­uted to life on Earth.</p>
    <p>The Hayabusa2 – named for the pere­grine fal­con – or­bited above Ryugu for a few months be­fore land­ing, then used small ex­plo­sives to blast a crater and col­lected the re­sult­ing de­bris.</p>
    <p>Af­ter drop­ping off the cap­sule, it changed course and headed back into space.</p>
    <p>That cap­sule plunged to Earth in Aus­tralia’s out­back on Dec 6 and was flown to Ja­pan. The fi­nal stage of its jour­ney was by truck to a JAXA re­search cen­tre just out­side Tokyo, where it was greeted by a crowd of ex­cited re­searchers.</p>
    <p>Next up is re­mov­ing and pre­par­ing the sam­ples, in­clud­ing weigh­ing them to de­ter­mine just how much has been ob­tained, a process that will take some time, be­fore re­search can be­gin.</p>
    <p>“We’re ab­so­lutely thrilled,” said Nagoya Univer­sity Pro­fes­sor Sei­ichiro Watan­abe, who heads the re­search team. “There’re so many things we should be able to learn from this.”</p>
