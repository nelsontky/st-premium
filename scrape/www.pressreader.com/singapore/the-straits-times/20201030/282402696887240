    <p>A doc­tor with Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal (TTSH) is fac­ing crim­i­nal ac­tions af­ter he al­legedly caused death by neg­li­gent driv­ing in an ac­ci­dent in Tampines last year.</p>
    <p>Ernest Fu Weizhong, 37, a con­sul­tant, had his case last heard in a dis­trict court on Oct 15.</p>
    <p>There are two charges against him – one of caus­ing death by neg­li­gent driv­ing and one of caus­ing hurt by neg­li­gent driv­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, Fu was driv­ing along Tampines Av­enue 12 at around 8pm on Oct 8 last year when he ar­rived at a traf­fic light junc­tion at the slip road into Tampines Ex­press­way.</p>
    <p>While mak­ing a right turn into the slip road, he is said to have failed to give way to other ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>This al­legedly re­sulted in a col­li­sion with a car that was go­ing straight on Tampines Av­enue 12 in the op­po­site di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>The driver of the other car, Mr Soon Jin Joke, 68, suf­fered in­juries, in­clud­ing chest pain, in the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>His 96-year-old pas­sen­ger, Ms Heng Fong Boey, died as a re­sult of the in­juries she sus­tained.</p>
    <p>Fu’s bail was set at $10,000 and the case has been ad­journed to next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of caus­ing a death by neg­li­gent driv­ing, he can be jailed for up to two years and fined.</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers con­victed of caus­ing hurt by neg­li­gent driv­ing can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $2,500.</p>
