    <p>What are your con­cerns about the pro­posed re­vamp of MediShield Life?</p>
    <p>Is this a good time to im­pose such in­cre­ments when there is a rel­a­tively large group of peo­ple fac­ing eco­nomic duress due to the volatile sit­u­a­tion we are still in? At this junc­ture, sav­ings will be nec­es­sary to weather a storm of such na­ture and mag­ni­tude.</p>
    <p>Also, med­i­cal ex­penses should be looked into. Prices can be bet­ter man­aged by med­i­cal providers.</p>
    <p>Zeus He</p>
    <p>Why can’t we im­ple­ment some­thing like car in­sur­ance? If you claim, then your pre­mium will go up; and for those who don’t make a claim, they will pay pre­mi­ums with­out an in­crease. I think this will be fair, but not sure how work­able it is.</p>
    <p>Bilal Ali Ahamed</p>
    <p>I had a biopsy done re­cently as an out­pa­tient at a gov­ern­ment med­i­cal cen­tre. But my MediShield claim was re­jected – the rea­son be­ing that I was not hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>The biopsy was nec­es­sary as they found some­thing that re­quired fur­ther eval­u­a­tion, so why can’t I claim? Luck­ily, I have a rider. Imag­ine those with­out rid­ers and are led to be­lieve they can claim their med­i­cal ex­penses from MediShield.</p>
    <p>Pump­kim Li</p>
    <p>My ex­pe­ri­ence with in­sur­ance pay­outs is that you re­alise too late that you have to be ut­terly maimed or dy­ing be­fore in­sur­ers would pay out. Bet­ter to keep your sav­ings than fork­ing out $500 or more ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>Faith Col­lie</p>
    <p>Can we have the fine print for this? We don’t even know what is be­ing cov­ered.</p>
