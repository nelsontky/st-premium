    <p>A visit to a Tekka toy shop in­spired con­struc­tion en­gi­neer Ra­jen­dran Vi­jayakanth, 29, to write the whim­si­cal, bit­ter­sweet poem that would win him the first prize at the sev­enth Mi­grant Worker Po­etry Com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Vi­jayakanth, who is from Tamil Nadu, In­dia, was i n Tekka i n Au­gust, ac­com­pa­ny­ing a friend who was re­turn­ing to In­dia and wanted to buy gifts for his son.</p>
    <p>See­ing the toys on dis­play – tigers, cows, cats and cars – re­minded him of the idyll of his child­hood, a far cry from his work­ing life in Sin­ga­pore, where he has been for seven years. “I be­gan to play with them,” he said. “I for­got my­self.”</p>
    <p>Vi­jayakanth never ex­pected his poem, The One Who Buys Dolls In Tekka, to win. “It’s un­be­liev­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion, in which record­ings of the 16 fi­nal­ists read­ing their po­ems were screened on Face­book Live on Sun­day, capped off t he nine-day Global Mi­grant Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial fes­ti­val, which be­gan in 2018 and was held in its first dig­i­tal edi­tion this year due to Covid-19, fea­tured 30 events, in­clud­ing the Malaysia Refugee and Mi­grant Worker Po­etry Com­pe­ti­tion; a di­a­logue with Ms Gol­riz Ghahra­man, an Iran-born asy­lum seeker who was the first refugee to be elected to New Zealand’s Par­lia­ment; and Look Ma I’m Bri­tish, a play by mi­grant worker the­atre group The Birds Mi­grant The­atre.</p>
    <p>The an­nual Mi­grant Worker Po­etry Com­pe­ti­tion, which is or­gan­ised by Sin­ga­porean and mi­grant vol­un­teers, be­gan in 2014.</p>
    <p>This year, the or­gan­is­ers close to dou­bled the prize money, which they said was due to the sav­ings from not hav­ing to host the Global Mi­grant Fes­ti­val as a phys­i­cal event, and also in recog­ni­tion that this has been an es­pe­cially tough year for mi­grants.</p>
    <p>They in­creased the first prize from the usual $500 to $1,000.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh­i worker Mah­fu­jur Rah­man re­ceived the $500 se­cond prize, while In­done­sian do­mes­tic work­ers Eli Nur Fadi­lah and Su­marni tied for third place and will get $300 each.</p>
    <p>The judges for this year’s fi­nals, lo­cal writ­ers Alvin Pang, K. Kana­galatha, Na­bi­lah Said and Chow Teck Seng, said their choices were unan­i­mous.</p>
    <p>“It’s sur­pris­ing how the qual­ity of the writ­ing and the feel­ings can come across, even in a dig­i­tal form,” said Pang.</p>
    <p>He added: “I find also that just be­cause some­thing is sim­ple doesn’t mean that it’s sim­plis­tic. Some of the (win­ning po­ems) look quite sim­ple on the page. But when you lis­ten to them, when you read them care­fully, you re­alise that there are a lot of things go­ing on be­neath the sur­face.”</p>
    <p>Vi­jayakanth said he does not yet know what he will do with his prize money, though he is con­sid­er­ing do­nat­ing it to char­i­ties in his home­town that sup­port ed­u­ca­tion for the poor.</p>
    <p>Like most, he has spent the pan­demic pe­riod in Sin­ga­pore feel­ing “scared and wor­ried”, do­ing ex­tra work to make up for col­leagues be­ing un­able to leave their dor­mi­to­ries and fend­ing off re­quests from his fam­ily to re­turn home. He is mar­ried with no chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“This fear is nor­mal. It is some­thing all na­tion­al­i­ties ex­pe­ri­ence,” he said. “We are to­gether in this.”</p>
    <p>He be­gan writ­ing love po­ems when he was 16, but kept them hid­den. “Grow­ing up meant that I could write po­etry not only for love, but also for ev­ery­thing I see, for ev­ery­thing that flies, for ev­ery­thing that suf­fers, for ev­ery­thing that dies, for the rain, the cloud, the bee­tle, the bud, the fallen flower, the dead bird, the dy­ing an­i­mal,” he said.</p>
    <p>He hopes to pub­lish a col­lec­tion some day. “I do not know if I have ma­tured in writ­ing po­etry. But the urge to write keeps com­ing.”</p>
