    <p>The open­ing of the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week (SIEW) 2020 yes­ter­day saw the first preevent Covid-19 swab­bing tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>A pi­lot run of pre-event test­ing us­ing anti­gen rapid tests (ART) was an­nounced l ast Tues­day by the multi-min­istry task force deal­ing with the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At the time, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said that a suc­cess­ful pi­lot run might con­trib­ute to­wards a loos­en­ing of lim­its on group sizes for so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned that the tests, which are less sen­si­tive than the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests used con­ven­tion­ally, may not be able to catch ev­ery sin­gle Covid-19 case, and that safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures would still need to be ob­served.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times ar­rived at the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, where SIEW 2020 is be­ing held, yes­ter­day morn­ing, there were no long queues or crowds typ­i­cally as­so­ci­ated with Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions) events.</p>
    <p>Signs were present on var­i­ous lev­els of the cen­tre re­mind­ing par­tic­i­pants to down­load the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether to­kens were pro­vided free at the en­trance to the hall where the event was be­ing held. The Straits Times was told that par­tic­i­pants were al­lowed to keep the to­kens.</p>
    <p>Af­ter check­ing in with SafeEn­try and hav­ing their tem­per­a­ture taken, par­tic­i­pants en­tered a main hall where they were sep­a­rated into dif­fer­ent zones for swab­bing.</p>
    <p>Each zone had its own set of swab­bing sta­tions and screen­ing reg­is­tra­tion counter, where par­tic­i­pants re­ceived a con­fir­ma­tion SMS from the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and a set of la­bels for their tests.</p>
    <p>They were then seated at a swab­bing sta­tion, where a swab­ber ex­plained the test­ing process and car­ried out the pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants had a swab stick in­serted about 2.5cm up their nos­trils and twirled sev­eral times, and were then told to wait for the re­sults, which were sent via SMS.</p>
    <p>The seats for test­ing were wiped down and sani­tised af­ter each test.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple were not stopped from min­gling with one an­other while wait­ing for their re­sults in the main hall, but had to present their re­sults at a check-in counter be­fore they were given their badges and al­lowed to en­ter the ball­room where the speeches were tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>Eight safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors were also present to en­sure safe man­age­ment mea­sures, such as the wear­ing of masks and mak­ing sure that ev­ery­one re­mained a me­tre apart from one an­other.</p>
    <p>Around 215 tests were car­ried out yes­ter­day, and most peo­ple ap­peared to have no is­sues with them. No one tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“I think it is bear­able and quite fast, and the (swab­ber) was very gentle. I am quite happy with it, I wor­ried for noth­ing,” said Ms Jen Tan, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of so­lar for Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia in the en­ergy di­vi­sion at Sem­b­corp So­lar Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity (EMA), SIEW 2020 is a week-long plat­form for en­ergy pro­fes­sion­als and pol­i­cy­mak­ers to dis­cuss and share strate­gic per­spec­tives on is­sues in the in­dus­try and their im­pact.</p>
    <p>This is the 13th year that SIEW is run­ning, but the first time it has been trans­formed into a hy­brid event with both vir­tual and on-site par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>“I am very happy that ex­hi­bi­tions are get­ting back again, and I hope ev­ery­thing goes smoothly,” said an­other par­tic­i­pant, Mr Ar­turo Coloma, an in­ter­na­tional trade ad­viser at the Span­ish Em­bassy in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post later that day, Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing, who gave the open­ing ad­dress at SIEW 2020, said the event had gone smoothly. He added that the Mice sec­tor sup­ports more than 34,000 jobs here.</p>
