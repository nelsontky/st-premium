    <p>1</p>
    <p>West Ham man­ager David Moyes has called for more clar­ity from the video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) sys­tem after it al­lowed a con­tro­ver­sial Brighton goal to stand in t h e i r 2 - 2 P r e mi e r League draw on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Lewis Dunk scored in the 70th minute to put the vis­i­tors up 2-1 but tele­vi­sion re­plays showed the ball ap­peared to hit his arm be­fore he took the shot.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his strike was re­viewed by VAR, which did not find con­clu­sive ev­i­dence to disal­low it, lead­ing Moyes to claim he did not think “any­one is con­vinced by the an­swers we are get­ting”.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>BLADES LOOK­ING FOR A CHEAP GOAL FIX</p>
    <p>Sh­effield United will add short-term re­in­force­ments in the Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow as they bid to drag them­selves out of a rel­e­ga­tion bat­tle, man­ager Chris Wilder said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Blades, who have only two points from 15 games, have made the worst start to a top-flight sea­son but the club have no in­ten­tion of splash­ing the cash.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Wilder will seek to wheel and deal, while hop­ing his be­lea­guered team can some­how step up even after con­ced­ing that “ev­ery­body looks at the po­si­tion and say we’re buried and done for”.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>As­ton Villa’s £28 mil­lion (S$50.3 mil­lion) clu­brecord sign­ing Ol­lie Watkins (above) has not found the back of the net since Nov 8 but he con­tin­ues to con­trib­ute in other vi­tal ways.</p>
    <p>The Vil­lans made light of play­ing half the match with 10 men to thrash Crys­tal Palace 3-0 and move into the top seven in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>The most ex­pen­sive striker sold by a Cham­pi­onship club, Watkins, who ar­rived from Brent­ford in Septem­ber, tor­mented the Ea­gles back­line through­out and set up all three goals, lead­ing to praise from man­ager Dean Smith and pun­dits alike.</p>
