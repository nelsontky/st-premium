    <p>The Hous­ing Board’s deficit climbed to $2.66 bil­lion in the fi­nan­cial year ended March 31, from about $1.98 bil­lion the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>This is the statu­tory board’s high­est deficit fig­ure so far.</p>
    <p>It comes largely on the back of a gross loss on the sale of flats, dis­burse­ment of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) hous­ing grants and the ex­pected loss for flats that are cur­rently un­der devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In its an­nual re­port pub­lished yes­ter­day, the HDB recorded a deficit of about $3.11 bil­lion from its hous­ing pro­grammes, off­set by a $446 mil­lion sur­plus from other ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the 2019/2020 fi­nan­cial year, $631 mil­lion in CPF hous­ing grants were given to el­i­gi­ble buy­ers of re­sale flats and ex­ec­u­tive con­do­mini­ums, com­pared with $532 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>On the up­grad­ing front, the HDB saw a deficit of $440 mil­lion, down from $557 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year. The up­grad­ing pro­grammes for hous­ing es­tates are the Home Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme (HIP), the Neigh­bour­hood Re­newal Pro­gramme and the Lift Up­grad­ing Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The de­crease in deficit was due to a lower ex­pen­di­ture for the HIP, as com­pared with the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year, said the HDB.</p>
    <p>The HDB recorded a lower gross loss of $721 mil­lion, at­trib­uted to the lower num­ber of flats sold.</p>
    <p>In the 2019/2020 fi­nan­cial year, 11,609 units were sold, com­pared with 16,608 units in the pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial year.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, the HDB re­ceives a grant from the Min­istry of Fi­nance to fi­nance its deficit. This year, the grant is $2.69 bil­lion, com­pared with $2.03 bil­lion in the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>The cu­mu­la­tive gov­ern­ment grants pro­vided to the HDB since its es­tab­lish­ment in 1960 now stands at $36.22 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>In Sep­tem­ber last year, the HDB an­nounced a sim­pli­fied grant struc­ture – the En­hanced CPF Hous­ing Grant (EHG) – and raised in­come ceil­ings for el­i­gi­ble buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­der the EHG, el­i­gi­ble buy­ers of new and re­sale flats can get a grant of up to $80,000, with no re­stric­tions on their choice of flat type and lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Re-Of­fer of Bal­ance Flats ex­er­cises were scrapped in March this year, in a move to help home seek­ers ac­cess flats more quickly.</p>
    <p>This means that all un­sold BuildTo-Or­der flats will first be of­fered through Sale of Bal­ance Flats ex­er­cises, and those that re­main un­s­e­lected will be di­rectly of­fered for open book­ing, which al­lows home seek­ers to ap­ply for a new flat all year round.</p>
    <p>To­day, 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion live in HDB flats, with about nine in 10 own­ing their homes.</p>
    <p>HDB chair­man Bobby Chin said: “The Covid-19 pan­demic has, how­ever, shown us that even the best­laid plans can be dis­rupted by un­fore­seen chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“It has also un­cov­ered op­por­tu­ni­ties in de­sign­ing and plan­ning fu­ture homes, es­pe­cially in the ar­eas of health and well­ness.</p>
    <p>“With our fin­gers on the pulse of the built en­vi­ron­ment, the HDB will re­main re­silient and fo­cused on our goal of de­vel­op­ing the best pos­si­ble homes for Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
