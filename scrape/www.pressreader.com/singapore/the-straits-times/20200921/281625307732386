    <p>The idea of gen­der equal­ity goes be­yond mea­sures of per­for­mance in spe­cific fields, and must “be im­printed deeply into our col­lec­tive con­scious­ness”, said Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>When ev­ery boy and girl is taught from an early age that both gen­ders are to be treated equally and with re­spect, and this mind­set change is in­ter­nalised, so­ci­ety’s whole out­look on a va­ri­ety of gen­der is­sues, such as sex­ual vi­o­lence, will be eas­ier to change, he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was ex­plain­ing the think­ing that led to the Gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion to work with Sin­ga­pore­ans to un­der­take a re­view of women’s is­sues, in a bid to ad­dress gen­der in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The re­view will see a White Pa­per tabled in Par­lia­ment in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam was speak­ing at a vir­tual di­a­logue, the first of a se­ries of up­com­ing en­gage­ment ses­sions to gather feed­back and rec­om­men­da­tions on is­sues that af­fect women at home, in schools, at work­places and in the community.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said the topic of women and gen­der equal­ity “is some­thing that has been im­por­tant to us, for a long time. Many steps have been taken... But, de­spite the progress, it is still a work in progress.”</p>
    <p>He noted that women have ad­vanced in many ar­eas, in­clud­ing ed­u­ca­tion, the work­force, boards and pol­i­tics, but cul­tural, so­cial and struc­tural hur­dles re­main.</p>
    <p>“Gen­der equal­ity is go­ing to take a lot of ef­fort. But I be­lieve we can do it. It is go­ing to re­quire a change in our cul­tural and value sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>He cited penal­ties for sex­ual vi­o­lence – which will no longer be “just an­other of­fence” – as an ex­am­ple of how this would work.</p>
    <p>“It should not be ap­proached sim­ply as pe­nal­is­ing an of­fence. It must also be seen as pe­nal­is­ing a gross vi­o­la­tion of fun­da­men­tal val­ues.”</p>
    <p>This means that usual mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors will have less force when they are viewed in the light of an act that is a breach of fun­da­men­tal val­ues, said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>“The start­ing point should be that this should not have hap­pened. No ex­cuses, pe­riod. Ex­cuses that a per­son is young, he is in uni­ver­sity and so on, should be of less weight.</p>
    <p>“For that to be so, the un­der­stand­ing, learn­ing, in­ter­nal­i­sa­tion should be deep. It has to be built up, and taught from an early age. So­ci­ety has to put a pre­mium on that. Ev­ery boy and girl should grow up know­ing this is com­pletely un­ac­cept­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter added that the Gov­ern­ment takes a very se­ri­ous view to­wards of­fences against young chil­dren, not­ing that while young boys are tar­geted too, pro­por­tion­ately, more girls are vic­tims.</p>
    <p>There are a few points that will have to be looked at specif­i­cally, such as the con­text of the of­fence that could let per­pe­tra­tors get away scot-free. “Some­times of­fences are in fam­ily sit­u­a­tions and chil­dren are too fear­ful to report (them). Ev­i­dence from young chil­dren of­ten is dif­fi­cult to rely on. We have to deal with this,” Mr Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>The stiff­ness of penal­ties will also have to be scru­ti­nised. While amend­ments were made to the Pe­nal Code last year to en­hance penal­ties and pro­vide more pro­tec­tion, Mr Shan­mugam said that “if the re­view that is go­ing to be un­der­taken sug­gests we should make them even stiffer, we will do so”.</p>
    <p>It will also be im­por­tant to track what hap­pens to per­pe­tra­tors af­ter their re­lease, he added.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter noted that the se­ries of voyeurism cases in uni­ver­si­ties that sur­faced from last year, as</p>
    <p>well as the case re­lat­ing to a National Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore den­tistry stu­dent ear­lier this year, stirred much de­bate on the penal­ties the per­pe­tra­tors should face.</p>
    <p>There was also much dis­cus­sion on the rel­e­vance of fac­tors, such as the de­fen­dant hav­ing a bright fu­ture and whether it was a sin­gle rash act, and how much th­ese should count in mit­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>While penal­ties have been made stiffer for a se­ries of of­fences, and acts such as sex­ual groom­ing have been clas­si­fied as of­fences, “those are the rel­a­tively eas­ier parts”, said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>“It set me think­ing – what is the frame­work, the per­spec­tive we need, in ap­proach­ing th­ese cases... Is there a more philo­soph­i­cal, fun­da­men­tal way of ap­proach­ing this – to deal with the prob­lem, be­yond just in­creas­ing the penal­ties? To try and make sure that, in the first place, peo­ple are aware that they shouldn’t do it, and how so­ci­ety views th­ese of­fences?” he added.</p>
    <p>“Today’s event, and the idea of a thor­ough re­view – the i dea of analysing the is­sues from the per­spec­tive of gen­der equal­ity and re­spect be­ing a fun­da­men­tal value, arose from that think­ing.”</p>
