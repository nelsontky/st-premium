    <p>New home sales con­tin­ued to rise for a third straight month amid a wors­en­ing eco­nomic out­look, with devel­op­ers sell­ing 1,080 non-landed pri­vate homes last month, up</p>
    <p>8.2 per cent from June. This is up from a near six-year low dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker in April, but sales were down 8.4 per cent from 1,179 year on year.</p>
    <p>EX­ER­CIS­ING CAU­TION</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ers need more time to re­cal­i­brate their pric­ing strate­gies as well as to (im­ple­ment) safe man­age­ment mea­sures, espe­cially for larger-scale ’’ projects.</p>
    <p>MR ONG TECK HUI, se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy at JLL, on the ab­sence of new launches last month.</p>
    <p>New home sales con­tin­ued to rise for a third straight month amid a wors­en­ing eco­nomic out­look, with devel­op­ers sell­ing 1,080 non­landed pri­vate homes last month, up 8.2 per cent from June.</p>
    <p>This is up from a near six-year low dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April, but sales were down 8.4 per cent from 1,179 a year ago.</p>
    <p>There were 869 pri­vate homes launched in July, up nearly 46 per cent from 597 in June, but down 4.6 per cent from 911 a year ago.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the units sold were from ear­lier launches, which ac­counted for 68 per cent of July’s to­tal sales, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures, re­leased by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) yes­ter­day, ex­cluded ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) units, a pub­lic-pri­vate hous­ing hy­brid. In­clud­ing EC units, 1,142 new non-landed homes were taken up last month, up nearly 11 per cent from June, but down about 27 per cent from 1,557 a year ago, the URA data showed.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of re­search at PropNex, noted that while the rel­a­tively brisk sales in re­cent months may seem at odds with the gloomy eco­nomic prog­no­sis, the cur­rent down­turn is not felt evenly across all sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Some sec­tors – such as fi­nan­cial ser­vices and tech – have held up bet­ter than oth­ers, and (those who) feel more se­cure about their job prospects or have built up sub­stan­tial sav­ings may see this as an op­por­tune time to en­ter the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ab­sence of new launches last month shows cau­tion among some devel­op­ers. Although showflats re­opened on June 19, they did not rush to launch new projects be­fore the start of the Hun­gry Ghost month to­mor­row, a pe­riod that typ­i­cally sees a qui­eter mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Devel­op­ers need more time to re­cal­i­brate their pric­ing strate­gies as well as to (im­ple­ment) safe man­age­ment mea­sures, espe­cially for larger-scale projects,” said Mr Ong Teck Hui, se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy at JLL.</p>
    <p>Po­ten­tially af­fect­ing new launches and sales take-up for the rest of the year are fac­tors like the sever­ity of the re­ces­sion and whether the pan­demic re­mains un­der con­trol, he added. Up­com­ing launches in­clude Pen­rose in Sims Drive and The Land­mark in Chin Swee Road.</p>
    <p>Last month’s take-up was led by projects in the subur­ban sub-mar­ket (out­side cen­tral re­gion) with 548 sales, fol­lowed by 419 units sold in the city fringes or rest of cen­tral re­gion, and 113 in the prime districts or core cen­tral re­gion.</p>
    <p>So far this month, free­hold Forett at Bukit Timah is the only new launch, sell­ing 172 units at a me­dian price of $1,931 psf, JLL said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional, noted that for­eign buy­ing slowed last month, with only 34 or 3.2 per cent of new sales caveats lodged by for­eign­ers, com­pared with 47 or 4.9 per cent in June.</p>
    <p>Dis­put­ing talk of dis­counts, Mr Wong Xian Yang, Cush­man & Wake­field’s as­so­ci­ate di­rec­tor of re­search for Sin­ga­pore and South­east Asia, said me­dian prices of the top five sell­ing projects in July were sim­i­lar to or even higher com­pared with those from the time of their launch to July.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the me­dian price for The Florence Res­i­dences from the time of its launch to July was $1,471 per sq ft (psf), but it rose to $1,559 psf in July, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est in pricier units has picked up, an­a­lysts say. This is de­spite Sin­ga­pore suf­fer­ing a deeper re­ces­sion in the sec­ond quar­ter than ex­pected, with the econ­omy con­tract­ing 13.2 per cent year on year, sharper than a 12.6 per cent plunge ear­lier es­ti­mated and the worst on record, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try said last week.</p>
    <p>URA Realis data showed 147 deals trans­acted at more than $2 mil­lion each in July com­pared with 118 such deals in June, said CBRE’s head of re­search for South-east Asia Des­mond Sim. “There were also some large quan­tum deals of more than $5 mil­lion in lux­ury projects such as 15 Hol­land Hill last month.”</p>
