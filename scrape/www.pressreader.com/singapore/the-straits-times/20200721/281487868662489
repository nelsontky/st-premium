    <p>DUBLIN (Ohio) • A pro­ces­sion to vic­tory just would not have been the Span­ish way.</p>
    <p>Jon Rahm rode a fi­nal-round roller coaster to se­cure the Memo­rial Tour­na­ment at Muir­field Vil­lage in true Span­ish style by sur­viv­ing some tricky short game shots, a two-shot penalty, and the evap­o­ra­tion of a huge lead.</p>
    <p>His idol, the late Seve Balles­teros, would have been proud. And be­lieve it or not, de­spite the heart pal­pi­ta­tions, Rahm would not have it any other way.</p>
    <p>He could have kept the in­cred­i­ble eight-shot lead he held over Amer­i­can Ryan Palmer at the turn and en­sured the last nine holes was a ca­sual waltz to his golf des­tiny. But where is the fun in that?</p>
    <p>Balles­teros was a mae­stro when things got tough, find­ing ways to es­cape from trou­ble. Rahm needed some of the same magic on Sun­day at a bru­tal Muir­field Vil­lage that played hard and fast in swift winds.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old had seen his eight-shot lead drop to three when he and Palmer stood on the 15th tee.</p>
    <p>Rahm was bleed­ing, mo­men­tum against him and fears were grow­ing that he would slip up again, just like what hap­pened at the Farm­ers In­sur­ance Open in Jan­uary, when he fin­ished sec­ond de­spite be­ing the overnight leader.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the fact his ac­cu­racy on ap­proach con­tin­ued to desert him, the reign­ing Race to Dubai win­ner fo­cused hard.</p>
    <p>He re­fused to sur­ren­der to his in­ner de­mons, get­ting up and down for clutch pars on the par-five 15th, par-four 17th and par-four 18th, and chipped in for what was ini­tially con­sid­ered a birdie on the par-three 16th, only for a two-shot penalty to be added.</p>
    <p>Rahm had in­ad­ver­tently made the ball move as he ad­dressed the shot and had not re­placed it, turn­ing his score into a bo­gey.</p>
    <p>But it mat­tered not as the magic had lasted long enough for him to stay three shots up over Palmer (74) with a fi­nal round of three­over 75 and for a 279 to­tal.</p>
    <p>It gave the Euro­pean Tour’s Player of the Year his fourth PGA Tour ti­tle, se­cur­ing his as­cen­sion to the world No. 1 spot on the way. He is just the sec­ond Spa­niard, be­hind Balles­teros, to hold that sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“One of the best per­for­mances of my life,” he said af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>“Every shot counts, and I tried every shot and got those two last upand-downs, as a true Spa­niard would.</p>
    <p>“My short game has been un­be­liev­able all week. It’s been so good, and I’ve got­ten close to chip­ping in a cou­ple times. You al­ways hear about peo­ple say­ing cham­pi­ons make it hap­pen, and at that point, I made it hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>In the past, he has ad­mit­ted he would not have made it hap­pen in sim­i­lar cir­cum­stances. Emo­tion plays a huge role in his game and pre­vi­ously, it had worked against him.</p>
    <p>But he feels that he has ma­tured af­ter find­ing ways to chan­nel his emo­tions to do well.</p>
    <p>“Luck­ily, I’ve been pretty good at learn­ing from my mis­takes and get­ting a lit­tle bit bet­ter each time and to­day was a clear ex­am­ple of it,” he said at the Jack Nick­laus-hosted event.</p>
    <p>“I knew it was a com­plete grind, and it’s a true hon­our to be now the Memo­rial cham­pion and to be part of Jack’s (Nick­laus) legacy.”</p>
    <p>On re­plac­ing Ul­ster­man Rory McIl­roy at golf’s sum­mit, he said: “I made that deal with my­self very young. I be­lieve at 13 or 14, I started work­ing to­wards that goal, and every­thing I’ve done golf-wise has been to be­come No. 1 in the world and the best player I can be.</p>
    <p>“It’s pretty sur­real to think it’s hap­pened this quickly, in less than 10 years. I mean, how many peo­ple get to achieve a life­long dream in their mid-20s? It’s in­cred­i­ble.”</p>
