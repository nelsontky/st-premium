    <p>Jobs have emerged as a key is­sue in the elec­tion in the In­dian state of Bi­har, the first such poll dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to be a test for Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is the ju­nior part­ner in the state’s gov­ern­ing al­liance.</p>
    <p>The third phase of vot­ing is tak­ing place to­day for the 243-seat state assem­bly.</p>
    <p>Bi­har was the worst im­pacted by a strin­gent lock­down im­posed in March to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19, with hun­dreds of thou­sands of mi­grant work­ers around the coun­try, many of them Bi­haris, los­ing their jobs and mak­ing a des­per­ate dash to reach home, trig­ger­ing a hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Bi­har is the first elec­tion af­ter the pan­demic. For the first time, we are see­ing that sec­u­lar­ism and com­mu­nal­ism is not a dom­i­nant is­sue.</p>
    <p>“Ma­te­rial is­sues about jobs, em­ploy­ment, health se­cu­rity, fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity – these are some of the things which are hav­ing a larger bear­ing on the elec­toral cal­cu­la­tion of vot­ers,” said Pro­fes­sor Sajjan Ku­mar, a Delhi-based po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst. He added that Bi­har could turn out to be a har­bin­ger for vot­ers around the coun­try in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), an op­po­si­tion party, has promised one mil­lion jobs if elected, trig­ger­ing other em­ploy­ment-re­lated prom­ises from other par­ties.</p>
    <p>Bi­har, where 70 mil­lion peo­ple are el­i­gi­ble to vote, is one of In­dia’s poor­est states but has an im­pact on na­tional pol­i­tics due to its vast pop­u­la­tion. Along with a clutch of other poorer states, Bi­har has a young pop­u­la­tion and the lat­est poll has seen a new crop of younger lead­ers on the scene like Mr Te­jashwi Ya­dav, 30, of the RJD and Mr Chi­rag Paswan, 38, of Lok Jan­shakti Party, an­other lo­cal party.</p>
    <p>Both have taken over the par­ties built up by their fa­thers.</p>
    <p>“The new-age politi­cians Te­jashwi Ya­dav and Chi­rag Paswan have emerged as the game chang­ers in Bi­har 2020 elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Te­jashwi led RJD’s evo­lu­tion from a “sama­jik nyay” (so­cial jus­tice) party to one whose slo­gan is also “arthik nyay” (eco­nomic jus­tice) and this has res­onated among the poor,” said Pro­fes­sor Ash­wani Ku­mar at Tata In­sti­tute of So­cial Sci­ences, the author of Com­mu­nity War­riors: State, Peas­ants And Caste Armies In Bi­har.</p>
    <p>“This un­ex­pected sub­al­tern youth in­sur­gency will po­ten­tially im­pact the na­tional pol­i­tics as Bi­har and Ut­tar Pradesh’s pop­u­la­tions have the low­est me­dian ages, or youngest pop­u­la­tions, in the coun­try, while Ker­ala and Tamil Nadu have the high­est me­dian age, ac­cord­ing to cen­sus data. There­fore, the next gen­er­a­tion of young po­lit­i­cal lead­ers will come from places like Bi­har,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bi­har’s cur­rent chief min­is­ter is</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­tish Ku­mar, the leader of Janata Dal (United) (JDU), which is rul­ing the state in an al­liance with BJP. They are be­ing chal­lenged by a coali­tion of re­gional par­ties and the Congress.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into the polls, the JDU-BJP al­liance was strong but crit­i­cism di­rected at the chief min­is­ter for poor gov­er­nance by an erst­while ally, the Lok Jan­shakti Party, has weak­ened the al­liance.</p>
    <p>On the ground, there is anger against Mr Ku­mar for fail­ing to pro­tect the mi­grant work­ers, and he has also had to deal with grow­ing anti-in­cum­bency sen­ti­ment. He has been in of­fice for three terms, or 15 years.</p>
    <p>An opin­ion poll, by Times Now and Cvoter, has given the rul­ing al­liance the edge, find­ing that it would take 147 of the 243 seats in the leg­isla­tive assem­bly. Opin­ion polls can be un­re­li­able in In­dia.</p>
    <p>A win in Bi­har would re­verse a re­cent string of de­feats for the BJP in state elec­tions over the last four years.</p>
    <p>The party, which stormed back to power in a gen­eral elec­tion last year largely be­cause of Mr Modi’s pop­u­lar­ity, is fac­ing sev­eral tough state polls next year in West Ben­gal, Ker­ala and Tamil Nadu, where re­gional par­ties have the up­per hand.</p>
    <p>“Mr Modi’s pop­u­lar­ity re­mains across cat­e­gories. The only prob­lem is in state elec­tions, he may not be able to con­vert pop­u­lar­ity for votes. There is a clear dis­tinc­tion (in peo­ple’s minds) that for na­tional elec­tions it’s a vote for Mr Modi,” said Prof Sajjan Ku­mar.</p>
    <p>For the first time, we are see­ing that sec­u­lar­ism and com­mu­nal­ism is not a dom­i­nant is­sue. Ma­te­rial is­sues about jobs, em­ploy­ment, health se­cu­rity, fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity – these are some of the things which are hav­ing a larger bear­ing on the elec­toral cal­cu­la­tion of vot­ers. PRO­FES­SOR SAJJAN KU­MAR, a Delhi-based po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst.</p>
