    <p>Catch­ing a movie on the first week­end since TraceTo­gether check­ins were in­tro­duced at cin­e­mas on Mon­day proved to be a mostly stress-free ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Checks by The Sun­day Times over two hours yes­ter­day af­ter­noon found that about half of vis­i­tors to the cin­e­mas at the JCube and Jem malls in Jurong East used the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken to en­ter. The fa­cil­i­ties are run by Shaw The­atres and Cathay Cine­plexes re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Nearly all of th­ese cin­ema­go­ers used the TraceTo­gether app, with ST spot­ting just one per­son check­ing in with the to­ken. The other half used the older meth­ods – by scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes us­ing smart­phones, or scan­ning the NRIC bar code – which will no longer be al­lowed at cin­e­mas from Nov 16.</p>
    <p>Th­ese num­bers tal­lied with what cin­ema oper­a­tors saw across their out­lets over the week. Both Golden Vil­lage (GV) and Shaw told ST that more than half of their pa­trons were us­ing ei­ther the app or to­ken.</p>
    <p>A GV spokesman said: “Over the past few days, we have also ob­served a steady in­crease in... pa­trons who are ready with their app or to­ken with­out any ad­di­tional prompt­ing.”</p>
    <p>Oper­a­tors have spared no ef­fort in en­sur­ing cus­tomers get on board with the new rules. Signs and standees with in­for­ma­tion on TraceTo­gether have been put at prom­i­nent spots, and oper­a­tors have de­ployed staff to en­cour­age and guide pa­trons to adopt TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>Staff at Shaw JCube, for ex­am­ple, were seen tire­lessly in­form­ing pa­trons of the new re­quire­ments and the Nov 16 dead­line, as well as help­ing the less tech-savvy pa­trons to down­load the app.</p>
    <p>Cinema­goer Tao Guang, 28, down­loaded the TraceTo­gether app on the spot in JCube when asked to do so by Shaw staff. He spent about five min­utes set­ting up the app be­fore en­ter­ing the cin­ema.</p>
    <p>“I don’t find the (new TraceTo­gether check-ins) trou­ble­some be­cause it’s some­thing that’s nec­es­sary if we want to open up fur­ther,” said Mr Tao, who lives in Yew Tee and works in fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment. “But I’m not sure how con­ve­nient the app is yet, and I would prob­a­bly pre­fer to use the to­ken if I am able to col­lect one.”</p>
    <p>To­ken dis­tri­bu­tion was sus­pended be­cause of long queues at cer­tain col­lec­tion cen­tres, but re­sumed in limited fash­ion ear­lier in the week.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, to­kens can be col­lected only at Mar­sil­ing and Wood­grove com­mu­nity cen­tres (CCs) by res­i­dents who live in the con­stituency. The re­main­ing CCs will open up for col­lec­tion pro­gres­sively from now un­til mid-De­cem­ber.</p>

From Nov 16, us&#xAD;ing the TraceTo&#xAD;gether app or to&#xAD;ken will be the only way to check in for SafeEn&#xAD;try at cin&#xAD;e&#xAD;mas.</p>
