    <p>MOSCOW • Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin named a new act­ing gov­er­nor to head Rus­sia’s far east­ern re­gion of Khabarovsk yes­ter­day af­ter the pre­vi­ous re­gional head was ar­rested on mur­der charges, spark­ing a wave of protests.</p>
    <p>At least 10,000 peo­ple demon­strated in Khabarovsk last Satur­day to de­mand Moscow re­lease Sergei Fur­gal, a mem­ber of the ul­tra-na­tion­al­ist Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDPR) who won elec­tion in 2018 af­ter beat­ing a ri­val from the rul­ing pro-Putin party.</p>
    <p>Fur­gal, born in Rus­sia’s Far East, was de­tained on July 9 and flown to Moscow to face charges over the mur­der and at­tempted mur­der of mul­ti­ple busi­ness­men 15 years ago. He de­nies any wrong­do­ing. Fur­gal could face up to life in prison if found guilty of the charges.</p>
    <p>The protests broke out soon af­ter­wards and have con­tin­ued for over a week. Their size is un­usual for Rus­sia’s re­gions, as is the fact that the author­i­ties have not yet moved to break them up.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin yes­ter­day for­mally re­moved Fur­gal from his post and ap­pointed Mr Mikhail Degt­yaryov, 39, a law­maker and also an LDPR mem­ber, to take over as the act­ing head of the re­gion, ac­cord­ing to a de­cree pub­lished on the Krem­lin web­site.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin has so far pub­licly played down the protests which have high­lighted anger among some in the Far East over what they see as poli­cies em­a­nat­ing from de­tached fed­eral author­i­ties lo­cated in Moscow seven time zones to the west.</p>
    <p>The case has crys­tallised long­stand­ing re­sent­ment to­wards Moscow, which is of­ten seen as de­mand­ing loy­alty while giv­ing lit­tle in re­turn. In a blow to lo­cal pride, the Krem­lin re­sponded to Fur­gal’s elec­tion vic­tory in 2018 over its own can­di­date by re­draw­ing bu­reau­cratic bound­aries in the re­gion to give pri­macy to Vladi­vos­tok, Khabarovsk’s long-time ri­val.</p>
    <p>The un­rest also comes less than three weeks af­ter Rus­sians voted to back a set of sweep­ing re­forms clear­ing the way for Mr Putin to run for two more pres­i­den­tial terms, po­ten­tially re­main­ing in the Krem­lin un­til 2036 rather than step­ping down in 2024.</p>
    <p>Krem­lin critic Alexei Navalny, whose al­lies in the re­gion have backed the demon­stra­tions, cast Mr Degt­yaryov as a de­tached Krem­lin ap­pointee whose se­lec­tion he pre­dicted would fail to ap­pease pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Khabarovsk will hold re­gional elec­tions to choose a fully fledged new gov­er­nor in Septem­ber next year, Rus­sia’s elec­tion com­mis­sion said.</p>
