    <p>To­day, we are en­ter­ing the third phase of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing in its bat­tle to con­trol the Covid-19 pan­demic. Es­sen­tially, eight per­sons in­stead of five are al­lowed to gather, and there are more in­di­vid­u­als al­lowed at var­i­ous events.</p>
    <p>There is a sense of re­lief and per­haps quite a bit of joy and op­ti­mism as Sin­ga­pore­ans en­ter this phase. In­deed, I am grate­ful that af­ter many months, there seems to be some sem­blance of con­trol over the vi­ral sit­u­a­tion; how­ever, Sin­ga­pore­ans need to be mind­ful that it is not all over.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of re­stric­tions will mean that more in­di­vid­u­als are in­ter­act­ing and, in the spirit of cel­e­bra­tion, there may be loud ver­bal com­mu­ni­ca­tion, laugh­ter and even closer con­tact with one an­other. I am con­cerned that peo­ple will let their guard down in the midst of the fes­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The dis­ci­plined wear­ing of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing have con­trib­uted greatly in con­trol­ling the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>In­ci­den­tally, the num­ber of cases of in­fluenza and other res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses has fallen dur­ing this pe­riod (which tra­di­tion­ally yields an in­creased num­ber of such ill­nesses), and this is likely due to the wear­ing of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>As we en­ter phase three, Sin­ga­pore­ans must not re­lax th­ese pre­cau­tions, think­ing that they are no longer nec­es­sary. In fact, even af­ter this pan­demic has passed, peo­ple with res­pi­ra­tory ill­nesses should take upon them­selves the task of wear­ing masks while ill.</p>
    <p>Mass vac­ci­na­tion against the virus will be im­ple­mented next year. This is a nec­es­sary weapon against the spread of the virus. All should re­ceive the vac­ci­na­tion, when of­fered, ex­cept those who are ad­vised against it on med­i­cal grounds, those un­der 16 and preg­nant women (be­cause of in­suf­fi­cient data on safety for the lat­ter two groups of in­di­vid­u­als).</p>
    <p>It will, how­ever, take some time to vac­ci­nate about five mil­lion peo­ple, and it also takes some weeks for those vac­ci­nated to ac­quire im­mu­nity. Hence, the wear­ing of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing must still be prac­tised, and eased only when a ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion has been vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>There ought to be vig­i­lance in the midst of thank­ful­ness, for Sin­ga­pore is bat­tling against a global pan­demic, which is not just a tiny prob­lem that will go away on its own.</p>
    <p>I am grate­ful that af­ter many months, there seems to be some sem­blance of con­trol over the vi­ral sit­u­a­tion; how­ever, Sin­ga­pore­ans need to be mind­ful that it is not all over.</p>
