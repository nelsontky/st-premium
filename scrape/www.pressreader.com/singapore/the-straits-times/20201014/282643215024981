    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Do not be so hard on your­self – or any­one else. You are in a tricky sit­u­a­tion, but the last thing any­one needs is a string of crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>It is a great day to soak up some art or cul­ture so get out there and keep up with your lo­cal events and ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Take care of busi­ness – even if it means putting off the fun stuff. You are sure to en­joy all that more once the hard work is done.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Open up to that friend or co-worker who needs to hear the hard truth.</p>
    <p>You are at your best when com­mu­ni­cat­ing openly and hon­estly.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your fi­nan­cial busi­ness needs some love, so make time to hang out with what­ever you use to keep track of your cash.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your sense of per­sonal achieve­ment is height­ened and for good rea­son. You may find that it is eas­ier than usual to im­press oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You feel pretty sat­is­fied with to­day’s sit­u­a­tion, even if your en­ergy lev­els are rather low. It is a great day to take time off and just re­lax.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your so­cial life im­proves as you push for some­thing big­ger with a close friend. That may not mean ro­mance but some fun plans.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>It is not a good time for main­tain­ing mo­men­tum, but that can be a good thing. You have to cover all bases be­fore you push plans any fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your head for re­search is mak­ing life in­ter­est­ing, so do your home­work. You will dig up some new facts that send you in a new di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) Be cau­tious at work – you are risk­ing more than you re­alise. The odds of disas­ter are slim, but you would rather they be zero, right?</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Try not to worry too much about the long-term as­pects of to­day’s is­sue – in­stead, fo­cus on the peo­ple you have to deal with.</p>
