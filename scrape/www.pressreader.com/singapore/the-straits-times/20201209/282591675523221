    <p>Steer­ing a busi­ness through a pan­demic is hard enough. Do­ing so while play­ing a so­cial role at the na­tional level is even harder. Yet bal­anc­ing be­tween cor­po­rate and so­cial obli­ga­tions is some­thing that Seah Kian Peng, 58, has long had to do, as Group Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Of­fi­cer of Fair­Price Group and NTUC En­ter­prise. Run­ning the labour move­ment’s co-op­er­a­tives means be­ing re­spon­si­ble not just to share­hold­ers, but the wider com­mu­nity, says Mr Seah.</p>
    <p>In a year when the pan­demic saw su­per­mar­kets flooded with shop­pers, he was named Out­stand­ing CEO of the Year for guid­ing NTUC Fair­Price to play its cru­cial role in Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 re­sponse.</p>
    <p>A head for busi­ness</p>
    <p>Though Mr Seah has spent the last two decades in NTUC Fair­Price, his ca­reer has taken him across a whole spec­trum of or­gan­i­sa­tions. He started out serv­ing his schol­ar­ship bond with gov­ern­ment-linked firm In­deco En­gi­neers, be­fore be­ing posted to the Ad­min­is­tra­tive Ser­vice, head­ing the Min­istry of De­fence’s bud­get depart­ment.</p>
    <p>His next post­ing was to the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC), where he did cor­po­rate plan­ning and started NTUC Health­care’s chain of phar­ma­cies. When his bond was up, he headed for the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“That was some­thing that I al­ways wanted to do,” he re­calls. “The days when I was in the pub­lic ser­vice, I en­joyed it. But I knew that I am bet­ter at op­er­a­tions, busi­ness, ver­sus pol­i­cy­mak­ing, that kind of thing, so I’ve al­ways wanted that ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>He spent three years with pil­ing and en­gi­neer­ing firm Sum Cheong Cor­po­ra­tion – un­til the NTUC called him back. So in 1996, he re­turned to head NTUC Health­care, then NTUC Me­dia. In 2001, he be­came chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of NTUC Fair­Price, and then chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer in 2010.</p>
    <p>In 2019, he was con­cur­rently ap­pointed Group CEO of NTUC En­ter­prise Co-op­er­a­tive, the hold­ing en­tity of the labour move­ment’s so­cial en­ter­prises, in­clud­ing NTUC Fair­Price.</p>
    <p>In 2006, Mr Seah en­tered pol­i­tics, be­com­ing a Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment (MP). His in­ter­est in busi­ness ex­plains why, com­pared to his labour MP col­leagues who are more in­volved in labour re­la­tions and ad­vo­cacy, his work is fo­cused on so­cial en­ter­prises: “I’m the only one on that side. . . I think that is also a recog­ni­tion of my own strengths and weak­nesses.”</p>
    <p>When he joined NTUC Fair­Price, it was a su­per­mar­ket re­tailer that only crossed the S$1 bil­lion an­nual turnover mark that year. Now, it is part of the larger Fair­Price Group, with mul­ti­ple re­tail for­mats – from Fair­Price Xtra hy­per­mar­kets to con­ve­nience store chain Cheers – and over 570 con­sumer touch­points, in­clud­ing hawker cen­tres, food courts, cof­feeshops, and phar­ma­cies. The group is set to cross the S$4 bil­lion rev­enue mark this year.</p>
    <p>In the fu­ture, NTUC Fair­Price aims to be an “omni-chan­nel” re­tailer, with a seam­less ex­pe­ri­ence across phys­i­cal and on­line shop­ping. Its evo­lu­tion, in­clud­ing the in­tro­duc­tion of new for­mats, has been in re­sponse to chang­ing de­mo­graph­ics and life­styles, says Mr Seah. Savvier, well-trav­elled shop­pers, for in­stance, may have a de­mand for plant-based meats or or­ganic pro­duce.</p>
    <p>This is part of the bal­anc­ing act that NTUC’s so­cial en­ter­prises have to per­form, be­tween cor­po­rate and co-op­er­a­tive con­cerns. “We still need to sur­vive,” he says. “The part about be­ing sus­tain­able, be­ing com­mer­cially vi­able, is very im­por­tant. So that is no dif­fer­ent from run­ning any pri­vate sec­tor, pub­lic-listed com­pany. But I think the other di­men­sion which is equally im­por­tant ob­jec­tive.”</p>
    <p>In a way, these ob­jec­tives do align. The Fair­Price Group em­ploys 13,000 staff, he notes: “I have to make sure we earn to pro­vide jobs for 13,000 peo­ple. So vi­a­bil­ity is im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>In short, the group pro­vides “a unique op­por­tu­nity to do good while man­ag­ing and run­ning the busi­ness ef­fi­ciently”.</p>
    <p>As Group CEO, Mr Seah deals with fa­mil­iar busi­ness is­sues such as the bot­tom line, pro­duc­tiv­ity, re­source op­ti­mi­sa­tion, mar­ket rel­e­vance, part­ner­ships, iden­ti­fy­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and mit­i­gat­ing risks.</p>
    <p>Yet he does this while bear­ing in mind the group’s cen­tral ob­jec­tive – “It has al­ways been Fair­Price’s so­cial mis­sion to mod­er­ate the cost of liv­ing” – even if it means tak­ing cer­tain de­ci­sions which might be un­ten­able from a strictly busi­ness an­gle. “Our role kind of gets en­hanced – the so­cial role, the com­mu­nity role – when­ever there are crises that hit us,” says Mr Seah. This in­cludes pre­vi­ous pan­demics such as Sars and bird flu; eco­nomic crises; and even the haze, when NTUC Fair­Price was the first su­per­mar­ket to sell masks. Even for non-cri­sis sit­u­a­tions, such as the in­tro­duc­tion of the goods and ser­vices tax (GST), NTUC Fair­Price rose to the oc­ca­sion by ini­tially ab­sorb­ing the tax.</p>
    <p>Ini­tia­tives</p>
    <p>is the so­cial</p>
    <p>Covid-19, of course, has been un­prece­dented in many ways: “the scale, the in­ten­sity, and the im­pact”. NTUC Fair­Price’s cen­tral­ity in Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse is per­haps cap­tured by a happy lit­tle de­tail: in this year’s Cam­paign Asia-Pa­cific awards for Sin­ga­pore’s top lo­cal brands, it took top po­si­tion for the first time.</p>
    <p>Yet the role has not been easy to play. The first trial was when the Covid-19 Dorscon level was raised to orange in Fe­bru­ary, spark­ing panic buy­ing across the is­land and on­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah’s lead­er­ship in this mo­ment was one of the rea­sons that he was named Out­stand­ing CEO of the Year. He re­peat­edly as­sured the pub­lic that there were suf­fi­cient sup­plies, and called for calm – in­clud­ing via quick Face­book up­dates, when there was “no time for the cor­p­comms team to tell me what to do”, he re­calls.</p>
    <p>He also started var­i­ous ini­tia­tives dur­ing the pan­demic. These in­clude a Fair­Price Foun­da­tion cam­paign to do­nate up to S$500,000 to five or­gan­i­sa­tions – with plans to raise this to S$1 mil­lion for seven or­gan­i­sa­tions – to match the ser­vice fee for on­line or­ders; and a S$50 mil­lion sup­port pack­age by NTUC En­ter­prise, com­pris­ing new deals for union mem­bers and the ex­ten­sion of var­i­ous dis­counts.</p>
    <p>One new scheme close to Mr Seah’s heart is Fair­Price on Wheels, launched in April. “When the ‘cir­cuit-breaker’ was an­nounced, we saw that there were some ma­ture es­tates with a higher per­cent­age of low-in­come se­niors that did not have a su­per­mar­ket near where they lived,” he says. Fair­Price on Wheels brings es­sen­tial gro­ceries to such neigh­bour­hoods, evok­ing the pro­vi­sion vans of the 1960s.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the pan­demic has prompted busi­ness up­grades to NTUC Fair­Price’s in­fra­struc­ture and re­silience. The group in­vested heav­ily to up­grade its on­line gro­cery in­fra­struc­ture. It in­creased on­line ca­pac­ity by 30 per cent by con­vert­ing a brick-and-mor­tar store into a ful­fil­ment cen­tre, and has put in place more re­dun­dancy to cope with surges in de­mand. It also con­tin­ues to di­ver­sify its sources, with prod­ucts com­ing from over 100 coun­tries. Eggs, in par­tic­u­lar, are now sourced from much fur­ther afield, notes Mr Seah: “Never would I have imag­ined that we would im­port eggs from Poland or Ukraine.”</p>
    <p>NTUC Fair­Price’s role as a mar­ket leader is cen­tral to both its cor­po­rate and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. Apart from stay­ing ahead, it also plays a “bench­mark­ing role” that should not be un­der­es­ti­mated, says Mr Seah.</p>
    <p>Many years ago, for in­stance, NTUC Fair­Price was the first to in­tro­duce se­nior ci­ti­zen dis­counts, which are now com­mon­place: “And when the rest have it, it ben­e­fits ev­ery­one.” Dur­ing this pan­demic, it was the first to in­tro­duce a pri­or­ity shop­ping hour for se­niors and vul­ner­a­ble groups, which “speaks to the need of the day”. It was also the first to in­tro­duce pur­chase re­stric­tions – some­thing which a purely prof­it­seek­ing re­tailer might hes­i­tate to do.</p>
    <p>So­cial im­pact</p>
    <p>Mr Seah has had to make many such de­ci­sions even be­fore Covid-19. In March 2019, for in­stance, NTUC Fair­Price an­nounced a price freeze for 100 es­sen­tial items. This was meant to last till the end of June 2020, but has since been ex­tended till year-end.</p>
    <p>Though pre­ced­ing the pan­demic, this price freeze – and the as­sur­ance it pro­vides – came at an ideal time, says Mr Seah. But as he notes: “If we took on a purely com­mer­cial lens, it’s un­likely that we’d do this.”</p>
    <p>NTUC Fair­Price’s so­cial sig­nif­i­cance can be seen in smaller things, too: from cou­ples re­quest­ing to take wed­ding photos in su­per­mar­ket aisles, to gro­cery shop­ping as a multi-gen­er­a­tional fam­ily out­ing. “All these lit­tle things show that we are very much plugged in, and we are, you could say, part of the so­cial fab­ric,” he says.</p>
    <p>In be­ing part of ev­ery­day lives, the re­tail arm is sim­i­lar to the rest of the NTUC En­ter­prise group, of which Mr Seah has been Group CEO for just over a year. From in­sur­ance to preschools to real es­tate, NTUC En­ter­prise em­ploys some 22,000 staff, and serves some 2 to 3 mil­lion peo­ple in some way each day, says Mr Seah: “The so­cial im­pact that’s cre­ated as a whole is ac­tu­ally quite huge.”</p>
    <p>Yet that is also why he finds the role of Group CEO “quite chal­leng­ing”, he adds. Each en­ter­prise has its own in­dus­try-spe­cific chal­lenges, and its own con­sid­er­a­tions in bal­anc­ing the com­mer­cial side and its so­cial im­pact. Hav­ing to switch tracks be­tween very dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries in the course of his work is not easy, ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Then there is the greater sig­nif­i­cance of his role. “At times I also feel quite weighed down,” he con­fesses. “It’s more than a job. Your stake­hold­ers are quite di­verse – all im­por­tant. Share­hold­ers, staff, cus­tomers and the broader com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>“You get it right, the im­pact is great. You get it wrong. . .” Mr Seah trails off, but the weight of the im­pli­ca­tions is clear.</p>
    <p>It goes back, as al­ways, to the cen­tral mis­sion. This year in par­tic­u­lar, he adds, “the things we do are things in which we don’t put com­mer­cial con­sid­er­a­tions at the top of our mind”. Fair­Price on Wheels is a clear ex­am­ple: “For sure, if it was about com­mer­cial con­sid­er­a­tions – for this, we ac­tu­ally lose money. But we are do­ing it as a ser­vice. I think it goes to il­lus­trate what NTUC Fair­Price is about.”</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing the grat­i­tude and hap­pi­ness with which res­i­dents greeted the ap­pear­ance of the Fair­Price on Wheels vans, he says: “You can­not mea­sure that. The dif­fer­ence that it makes to this per­son’s fam­ily.”</p>
