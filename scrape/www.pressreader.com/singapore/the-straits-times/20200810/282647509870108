    <p>TOKYO • J-pop star To­mo­hisa Ya- mashita is one of the most pop­u­lar idols in Ja­pan and the most-fol­lowed Ja­panese male artist on In­sta­gram with more than 5.1 mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>So imag­ine the shock of his fans when a Ja­panese tabloid magazine claimed that Ya­mashita, 35, was seen drink­ing with un­der­age girls and was even sus­pected of spend­ing the night with one of them.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Shukan Bun­shun, Ya­mashita was seen at a night­club in Tokyo on July 30 with singer­ac­tor Kazuya Ka­me­nashi, who is from the same agency, Johnny & As­so­ciates, which rep­re­sents him.</p>
    <p>The magazine re­ported that there were sev­eral other peo­ple at the club at that time, with two girls who were un­der­age. The le­gal drink­ing age in Ja­pan is 20.</p>
    <p>It said the party ended at about 4am, with Ka­me­nashi, 34, re­turn­ing home alone.</p>
    <p>Ya­mashita checked into a ho­tel, with one of the un­der­age girls spot­ted tak­ing a taxi to the ho­tel later. The girl left the ho­tel at about 1pm, with Ya­mashita leav­ing about five min­utes later.</p>
    <p>Shukan Bun­shun said the girl is a 17-year-old stu­dent who is also a part-time model.</p>
    <p>Re­act­ing to the re­ports, Johnny & As­so­ciates ad­mit­ted in a state­ment that both Ya­mashita and Ka­me­nashi were drink­ing with un­der­age girls at that time.</p>
    <p>The agency said both artists were not aware of their real age, as the girls were in­tro­duced to them by other friends at the club. The agency did not men­tion any­thing about Ya­mashita’s stay in the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese me­dia won­dered if Ya­mashita would be sus­pended by the agency the way artists Hikaru Iwamoto and Kei­ichiro Koyama were for sim­i­lar of­fences.</p>
    <p>Other me­dia said Ya­mashita may de­velop his ca­reer over­seas af­ter star­ring in The Head, HBO Asia’s new thriller se­ries set in the Antarc­tica.</p>
