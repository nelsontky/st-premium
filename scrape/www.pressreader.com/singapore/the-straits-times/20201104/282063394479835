    <p>Re­cent at­tacks in France draw at­ten­tion to spo­radic out­breaks of mil­i­tancy, in spite of the global men­ace hav­ing been sub­dued largely since the ter­ror­ist at­tacks in the United States of 2001. Re­cently, a French mid­dle school teacher was be­headed in a sub­urb north of Paris by a man of Chechen ori­gin who sought to pun­ish him for hav­ing shown his pupils car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in a civics class on free­dom of ex­pres­sion. Then, a Tu­nisian man be­headed a woman and killed two oth­ers in a church in Nice. Also, a Greek Ortho­dox priest was shot at a church in Lyon. Such at­tacks, in­clud­ing one in Austria yes­ter­day, must be con­demned – ut­terly and with­out reser­va­tion – be­cause vi­o­lence can never be a le­git­i­mate re­sponse to griev­ances re­li­gious or sec­u­lar, real or imag­ined, slight or se­vere.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the at­tacks call at­ten­tion to the dif­fer­ent value frame­works that ex­ist in global so­ci­ety. France is a leading ex­po­nent of the in­vi­o­lable value of the free­dom of ex­pres­sion. It cer­tainly is a cher­ished goal in it­self, but all free­doms carry re­spon­si­bil­i­ties too. Those who lose sight of this might ar­gue that free­dom in­cludes the right to de­lib­er­ately of­fend peo­ple of faith, know­ing full well the sen­si­tiv­i­ties in­volved in do­ing so. That is un­wise and un­nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>That said, the re­ac­tion to such provo­ca­tion needs also to be re­spon­si­ble and rea­son­able as well. Clearly, the re­sort to threat, vi­o­lence and spread­ing ha­tred in the name of re­li­gion can­not be the proper way to re­spond to the chal­lenges of peace­ful co­ex­is­tence in a world marked by a di­ver­sity of be­liefs and val­ues. Rather, what is re­quired is a com­mit­ment by all to an ethic of un­der­stand­ing and tol­er­ance that places peace over dis­puted rights to be­lieve or to dis­be­lieve. Just as free­dom of speech should not con­done al­low­ing a per­son to shout “fire” falsely in a crowded cin­ema hall, there is no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for un­war­ranted provo­ca­tions that in­cite oth­ers to un­der­take a deadly re­sponse. Those re­sponses, too, can­not and should not ever be con­doned.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has worked hard to keep its dis­parate peo­ple liv­ing in peace, de­spite their dif­fer­ences of views, val­ues and faiths. The leg­isla­tive frame­work ap­par­ent in the Main­te­nance of Re­li­gious Har­mony Act and other statutes is un­der­pinned by a deep so­cial con­sen­sus on the need for re­li­gious re­spect in the ev­ery­day con­duct of eco­nomic and so­cial life. The con­sen­sus is tested oc­ca­sion­ally by rad­i­cals from dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties. But sec­u­lar Sin­ga­pore’s re­li­gious cre­den­tials are reaf­firmed when, for ex­am­ple, the Mufti, the high­est au­thor­ity on Is­lam here, con­demns the mur­ders in France in no un­cer­tain terms and reaches out to the Chris­tian com­mu­nity. The har­mony in Sin­ga­pore can­not be taken for granted – and must be worked at by all – to en­sure it can with­stand the strains from events else­where.</p>
