    <p>NEW DELHI • A top Face­book ex­ec­u­tive in In­dia has filed a po­lice com­plaint in New Delhi, say­ing she is re­ceiv­ing death threats fol­low­ing a me­dia re­port that said she and the US so­cial net­work com­pany al­legedly favoured Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s rul­ing party.</p>
    <p>Ms Ankhi Das, Face­book’s top pub­lic-pol­icy ex­ec­u­tive in In­dia, said in her com­plaint to Delhi po­lice that some in­di­vid­u­als on­line had “in­ten­tion­ally vil­i­fied” her due to their po­lit­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tions and were en­gag­ing in abuse, In­dian me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Ms Das has said the threats fol­lowed a Wall Street Jour­nal (WSJ) re­port last week that said she op­posed ap­ply­ing Face­book’s hate­speech rules to a mem­ber of Mr Modi’s party and some other Hindu na­tion­al­ist in­di­vid­u­als and groups “flagged in­ter­nally for pro­mot­ing or par­tic­i­pat­ing in violence”.</p>
    <p>“I am ex­tremely dis­turbed by the re­lent­less harassment meted out to me,” Ms Das said in her com­plaint, ac­cord­ing to In­dia’s Hindu news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Delhi po­lice did not re­spond to calls and text mes­sages from Reuters.</p>
    <p>Ms Das and Face­book did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment on the po­lice com­plaint. Face­book yes­ter­day re­ferred Reuters to a weekend state­ment that said it pro­hib­ited hate speech ir­re­spec­tive of one’s po­lit­i­cal po­si­tion but ac­knowl­edged, “there is more to do”.</p>
    <p>The WSJ ar­ti­cle has sparked a po­lit­i­cal storm in In­dia and raised ques­tions about Face­book’s con­tent reg­u­la­tion prac­tices. Ms Das had told staff that pun­ish­ing vi­o­la­tions by politi­cians from Mr Modi’s rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) “would dam­age the com­pany’s busi­ness prospects in the coun­try”, the WSJ ar­ti­cle said.</p>
    <p>For Face­book, which has over 300 mil­lion users in In­dia, the con­tro­versy comes months af­ter it in­vested US$5.7 bil­lion (S$7.8 bil­lion) in the digital unit of In­dia’s Re­liance In­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was also seen as close to re­ceiv­ing per­mis­sion to launch a pay­ments ser­vice on What­sApp, which also counts In­dia as its big­gest mar­ket with more than 400 mil­lion users.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s main op­po­si­tion Congress has seized on the WSJ story to seek a par­lia­men­tary in­ves­ti­ga­tion of Face­book em­ploy­ees’ al­leged ties with Mr Modi’s BJP.</p>
    <p>BJP law­mak­ers in turn ac­cused Face­book of cen­sor­ing na­tion­al­ist voices.</p>
