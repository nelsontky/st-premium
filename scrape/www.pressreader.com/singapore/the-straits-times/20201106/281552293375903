    <p>Bars from Sin­ga­pore had a mixed show­ing on the World’s 50 Best Bars list, with two bars in the top 10 but two fall­ing out of the top 50. At­las at Parkview Square (be­low) climbed one spot to</p>
    <p>No. 4 and is the top-rank­ing bar from Asia. Mean­while, Jig­ger & Pony at Amara Sin­ga­pore broke into the top 10 for the first time, tak­ing the No. 9 spot.</p>
    <p>In a year where travel re­stric­tions crip­pled global travel and hospi­tal­ity, bars from Sin­ga­pore had a mixed show­ing on the World’s 50 Best Bars list with two bars in the top 10, but two fall­ing out of the top 50.</p>
    <p>At­las at Parkview Square, best known for its 1,400 bot­tle gin col­lec­tion, climbed one spot to No. 4, and is also the top-rank­ing bar from Asia, beat­ing out the likes of Coa in Hong Kong (No. 8) and The SG Club in Tokyo (No. 10).</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Jig­ger & Pony at Amara Sin­ga­pore broke into the top 10 for the first time this year, at No. 9 spot.</p>
    <p>Founded by hus­band-and-wife team In­dra Kantono and Gan Guoyi, the bar – which puts Asian twists on cock­tail clas­sics – climbed 20 spots af­ter first en­ter­ing the list at No. 29 last year.</p>
    <p>It has been a year of suc­cesses for the bar, which also clinched the top spot on the Asia’s 50 Best Bars list in May.</p>
    <p>The 12th edi­tion of the an­nual re­sults was an­nounced in a vir­tual count­down that was livestream­ed yes­ter­day from Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The top three spots on the list went to bars in the United States and Europe – namely Con­naught Bar in Lon­don, Dante in New York, and The Clum­sies in Athens.</p>
    <p>Con­naught Bar and Dante swopped their top 2 spots from last year’s rank­ing, while The Clum­sies climbed two spots to No. 3.</p>
    <p>Else­where on the list, Sin­ga­pore bars slipped in the rank­ings. Man­hat­tan, which placed at No. 14, fell three spots, while Na­tive, which placed at No. 18, fell six spots.</p>
    <p>Only four Sin­ga­pore bars made the top 50 this year, com­pared with last year’s six. Oper­a­tion Dag­ger, which shut­tered its doors last Satur­day at its Ann Siang Hill home, is no longer on the list, while The Old Man Sin­ga­pore fell out of the top 50 from No. 38 to No. 58.</p>
    <p>Out­side of the top 50, Sin­ga­pore bars also had a de­cent show­ing on the 51-100 list with year-old No Sleep Club in Keong Saik Road rank­ing as the high­est-plac­ing bar from Asia at No. 53.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Tip­pling Club re-en­tered the 51-100 list at No. 64; 28 Hong Kong Street which placed at No. 86 fell from last year’s No. 61; while Gibson was an­other re-en­try at No. 92.</p>
    <p>The World’s 50 Best Bars list is com­piled by votes from The World’s 50 Best Bars Acad­emy, com­pris­ing over 540 global drinks ex­perts, in­clud­ing renowned bar­tenders and con­sul­tants, drinks writ­ers and cock­tail spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>For this year, the voting pe­riod ran from only Jan­uary last year to March this year, since the ma­jor­ity of bars were forced to close due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We at 50 Best hope that the an­nounce­ment of the list will act as a show of strength for the global bar com­mu­nity,” said World’s 50 Best Bars con­tent edi­tor Mark San­som, in a press re­lease.</p>
    <p>“It dis­plays to the world that even in the face of the ever-shift­ing chal­lenges and re­stric­tions be­ing thrown at them, bars are still do­ing ev­ery­thing that they can to con­tinue to pro­vide great hospi­tal­ity ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>
