    <p>Are there enough TraceTo­gether con­tact-trac­ing to­kens for ev­ery­one? Did the Gov­ern­ment put the cart be­fore the horse when it an­nounced manda­tory use of the sys­tem for check­ing in at all public venues even be­fore ev­ery­one had the chance to col­lect their to­ken?</p>
    <p>It is un­avoid­able that these ques­tions should be asked after res­i­dents formed long queues to pick up the to­kens, prompt­ing a sud­den halt in their dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>On Oct 20, the au­thor­i­ties said us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken to check in would be made manda­tory at cin­e­mas, restau­rants, work­places, schools and shop­ping malls by the end of De­cem­ber, as Sin­ga­pore pre­pares to en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Such premises will need to pro­gres­sively roll out the new na­tional check-in sys­tem, start­ing with cin­e­mas from Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas will also have to fully im­ple­ment TraceTo­gether for check­ing in much ear­lier, by Nov 16.</p>
    <p>The new sys­tem will re­place the cur­rent fa­mil­iar one that in­volves scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes with a phone cam­era or the SingPass mo­bile app, or bar codes on NRICs.</p>
    <p>By last week, only about 400,000 TraceTo­gether to­kens had been col­lected. But de­mand spiked right after news about their manda­tory use went out. Those plan­ning to catch a movie must be to­ken- or app-ready by Nov 16.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren and the el­derly, who com­monly do not have a smart­phone or the lat­est de­vice for us­ing the app, will need a to­ken.</p>
    <p>That is, if they can no longer scan the bar codes on their NRICs or stu­dent con­ces­sion passes.</p>
    <p>All res­i­dents aged seven and above, in­clud­ing pass hold­ers, are en­ti­tled to one to­ken.</p>
    <p>Long queues formed last Satur­day at some of the 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres/clubs (CCs) which served as dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres for the to­kens. Some peo­ple had to queue for about 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The next day, Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan urged the public not to rush, say­ing there would be more than enough to­kens.</p>
    <p>For the first time, the public was told about plans to give out 2.7 mil­lion to­kens, and that pro­duc­tion could in­crease de­pend­ing on de­mand. Had this in­for­ma­tion gone out ear­lier, the public’s fears of a sup­ply crunch might have been put to rest.</p>
    <p>But that was not the end of the story.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group (SNDGG) did a turn­about and sus­pended to­ken col­lec­tion for one day at all 38 CCs to re­boot its dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pre­vi­ous plan, all 108 CCs is­land­wide were set to start to­ken dis­tri­bu­tion by the end of next month. All of them would have catered to walk-ins.</p>
    <p>But this will no longer be the case. Dis­tri­bu­tion will now be stag­gered, one con­stituency at a time, “to bet­ter match de­mand and to avoid long queues”, said the SNDGG.</p>
    <p>Mar­sil­ing Com­mu­nity Club was the first to open yes­ter­day for res­i­dents in that con­stituency to col­lect their to­kens.</p>
    <p>How­ever, did this phased ap­proach get rid of the queues?</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times ar­rived at the CC at 9.45am yes­ter­day, there were al­ready about 100 peo­ple in the queue. Crowds con­tin­ued to stream in two hours later.</p>
    <p>One proven way to avoid over­crowd­ing is to fol­low what lo­cal tel­cos have done in the past for Ap­ple iPhone and Sam­sung Gal­axy phone launches.</p>
    <p>Buy­ers were able to reg­is­ter on­line and the tel­cos gave them a time slot to col­lect their phones at des­ig­nated col­lec­tion points. They even de­liver pur­chased phones to peo­ple’s homes nowa­days.</p>
    <p>And now, for the most im­por­tant ques­tion: Are there enough TraceTo­gether to­kens for ev­ery­one?</p>
    <p>Even if there is no sup­ply crunch, the Gov­ern­ment could have done bet­ter in co­or­di­nat­ing the time­lines for to­ken dis­tri­bu­tion and manda­tory TraceTo­gether roll­out at public venues.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, after all cin­e­mas here have rolled out the new check-in sys­tem by Nov 16, the only way to en­ter will be to use the TraceTo­gether to­ken or app.</p>
    <p>But Marine Pa­rade, Chai Chee and Mount­bat­ten res­i­dents – es­pe­cially chil­dren who can get their hands on a to­ken only from Dec 14 – ac­cord­ing to the full sched­ule on the To­kenGoWhere web­site – will not be able to catch a movie dur­ing the school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment should have given ev­ery­one who needs a to­ken a chance to col­lect one be­fore man­dat­ing its use for check­ing in at public venues.</p>
    <p>And it is not just the el­derly and chil­dren who are af­fected by the new to­ken re­quire­ment: Those who can­not take their mo­bile phones into their work­place – for se­cu­rity or any other rea­son – will also most cer­tainly need a TraceTo­gether to­ken.</p>
