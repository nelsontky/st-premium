    <p>JOLIN TO LAUNCH NEW AL­BUM?: Tai­wanese pop queen Jolin Tsai usu­ally uses her In­sta­gram ac­count to in­ter­act with her fans and share snip­pets of her life.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, she shared a photo of her­self hav­ing sup­per with singers Tanya Chua, Valen Hsu and Soda­green’s Wu Ching-feng, say­ing she ac­ci­den­tally tried to use her health in­sur­ance card to pay the bill.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sharp-eyed ne­ti­zens noted three days later that the 39-year-old has re­moved all the ac­counts she had been fol­low­ing on In­sta­gram while re­tain­ing all her 1,564 posts.</p>
    <p>The singer also posted a photo of the sky, with the cap­tion: “I look at the sky qui­etly and try to find the lost emo­tion.”</p>
    <p>Some ne­ti­zens asked on so­cial me­dia if she was feel­ing down, while oth­ers won­dered if she was plan­ning to an­nounce the launch of a new al­bum. Ap­par­ently, she did some­thing sim­i­lar be­fore re­leas­ing her al­bum Ugly Beauty in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ugly Beauty won Al­bum of the Year at Tai­wan’s Golden Melody Awards last year, while Womxnly, a track from the al­bum, won Song of the Year.</p>
    <p>With more than four mil­lion fol­low­ers, Tsai is the sec­ond most-fol­lowed Tai­wanese artist on In­sta­gram, af­ter ex-boyfriend su­per­star Jay Chou, who has more than six mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
