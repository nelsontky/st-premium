    <p>For Ms Win­nie Chan and Mr James Quan, their brand Bynd Ar­ti­san is not only a labour of love, but also part of a long legacy that has spanned close to 80 years. The hus­band and wife duo – who co­founded the brand in 2012 – started the busi­ness as an ex­pe­ri­en­tial re­tail con­cept.</p>
    <p>But while cus­tomers might know their brand for its chic, per­son­alised note­books and cus­tomised leather goods, few might know just how in­ter­twined the com­pany’s brand is with a tra­di­tional craft busi­ness whose his­tory spans decades.</p>
    <p>“It started with my grand­fa­ther, Mr Chan Koon Seng, who founded a small bindery work­shop back in 1942. We have since drawn in­spi­ra­tion from the hand-de­signed, tra­di­tional book­mak­ing meth­ods and machin­ery we used back in those days, with the skills of our older crafts­men re­ally tak­ing cen­tre stage (in our prod­ucts),” said Ms Chan.</p>
    <p>A third of Bynd Ar­ti­san’s staff are men and women above the age of 50, and many who have mas­tered the tricks of the leather-work­ing and craft­ing trade con­tinue hon­ing their skills at the brand’s ate­liers.</p>
    <p>Bynd Ar­ti­san was one of the 48 pi­o­neer re­cip­i­ents of the “Made With Pas­sion” Sin­ga­pore brand mark launched yes­ter­day. These lo­cal life­style brands were cho­sen for their strong con­nec­tion to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For Bynd Ar­ti­san, lev­er­ag­ing on a rich home-grown tra­di­tion has def­i­nitely paid off.</p>
    <p>From a rel­a­tively far-flung work­shop space at the Chan fam­ily’s fac­tory in Boon Lay, Bynd Ar­ti­san’s busi­ness has since flour­ished: It now has a flag­ship ate­lier in Hol­land Vil­lage, which opened in 2015.</p>
    <p>In 2017 and 2018, Bynd Ar­ti­san also opened re­tail stores in shop­ping malls such as Ion Or­chard, Takashimay­a and Raf­fles City.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s will­ing­ness to adapt is ap­par­ent from how the brand has quickly pushed out prod­ucts and pro­grammes that cater to cus­tomers amid the pan­demic, such as cus­tomised leather hand sani­tiser hold­ers. They also of­fer vir­tual work­shops by ship­ping tools and kits to par­tic­i­pants and live-stream­ing the process from its ate­lier.</p>
    <p>“We saw the Covid-19 pan­demic not only as a chal­lenge, but (also) as an ac­cel­er­a­tor. We are so hon­oured to be one of the first brands to re­ceive the brand mark. It is now on us to do bet­ter, and to make it work,” Mr Quan said.</p>
    <p>“I would say that our growth has in­volved a se­ries of con­tin­ual piv­ots, whether it be with our prod­uct range or ad­just­ing to the on­line en­vi­ron­ment. We have had to keep evolv­ing, while stay­ing true to our ethos: to cre­ate, with great pas­sion at the core of what we do.”</p>
