    <p>•</p>
    <p>OAK­LAND (Cal­i­for­nia) With the Covid-19 pan­demic still i n full swing and the first doses of a vaccine just start­ing to ship in the United States, Google has pushed back the planned re­turn to the of­fice by a few months, to Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>But even as it ex­tends the re­mote work pe­riod, Google is lay­ing out a se­ries of pro­posed changes that may sub­stan­tially al­ter how its em­ploy­ees and peo­ple at other tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies will work.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail to em­ploy­ees on Sun­day, Mr Sun­dar Pichai, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Google’s par­ent com­pany Al­pha­bet, said the com­pany was test­ing the idea of a “flex­i­ble work week” once it is safe to re­turn to the of­fice. Un­der the pi­lot plan, em­ploy­ees would be in the of­fice at least three days a week for “col­lab­o­ra­tion days”, and work from home the other days.</p>
    <p>“We are test­ing a hy­poth­e­sis that a flex­i­ble work model will lead to greater pro­duc­tiv­ity, col­lab­o­ra­tion and well-be­ing,” Mr Pichai wrote in the e-mail ob­tained by The New York Times. “No com­pany at our scale has ever cre­ated a fully hy­brid work­force model – though a few are start­ing to test it – so it will be in­ter­est­ing to try.”</p>
    <p>One thing not men­tioned by Mr Pichai is whether Google will re­quire em­ploy­ees to take the coro­n­avirus vaccine be­fore re­turn­ing to the of­fice. Google has said it rec­om­mends that em­ploy­ees ob­tain the vaccine when their healthcare provider or lo­cal pub­lic health au­thor­ity has told them it is avail­able to them. Google has also said it is look­ing for op­por­tu­ni­ties in mid-to-late 2021 to help make Covid-19 vac­cines avail­able to its work­ers, but only af­ter high-risk and high-pri­or­ity peo­ple glob­ally have re­ceived the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The tim­ing of Google’s plan to roll out the flex­i­ble work sched­ules is still up in the air be­cause of the dif­fer­ent state of the coro­n­avirus in dif­fer­ent coun­tries. And the new sched­ules may not ap­ply to some Google work­ers, like those who spend lots of time with cus­tomers or em­ploy­ees at its data cen­tres or labs.</p>
    <p>In March, Google was one of the first com­pa­nies to tell em­ploy­ees to start work­ing from home be­fore other cor­po­ra­tions had a grasp on the risks of work­ing to­gether in en­closed of­fices. It has re­peat­edly de­layed the tim­ing on when it ex­pects em­ploy­ees to re­turn to the of­fice from next Jan­uary to July and now, Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Af­ter such a long pe­riod of re­mote work, com­pa­nies are wrestling with how best to tran­si­tion work­ers back into of­fices.</p>
    <p>Last month, Vi­a­comCBS told em­ploy­ees that it ex­pects most of them to di­vide their time be­tween work­ing at home and in its of­fices. It said a hy­brid model would al­low more flex­i­bil­ity for em­ploy­ees, while re­duc­ing its real es­tate needs and keep­ing costs down.</p>
    <p>Net­flix chief ex­ec­u­tive Reed Hast­ings has said he has not seen “any pos­i­tives” from work­ing at home and that not be­ing able to get to­gether to dis­cuss ideas in per­son is a “pure negative”. How­ever, he said he ex­pected the five-day work week would be­come four days in the of­fice and one day re­mote af­ter the pan­demic.</p>
