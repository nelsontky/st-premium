    <p>As an NTUC so­cial en­ter­prise, Money Owl is on a mis­sion to help fam­i­lies make the best fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions. This has be­come more crit­i­cal as many Sin­ga­pore­ans worry about money mat­ters amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many peo­ple are be­wil­dered by hav­ing to man­age money or op­ti­mise their funds.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has sim­ply added to this and high­lighted the gaps in many peo­ple’s abil­ity to man­age their fi­nances,” said Ms Chuin, not­ing that four in 10 Sin­ga­pore­ans con­stantly worry about their fi­nances. She shares her views on some com­mon themes.</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL PROD­UCTS</p>
    <p>“When we talk about fi­nan­cial man­age­ment, many peo­ple think im­me­di­ately about sav­ings prod­ucts, in­vest­ment prod­ucts and in­sur­ance poli­cies and such. This is prob­a­bly how the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try has been go­ing about pro­vid­ing fi­nan­cial ad­vice for the re­tail seg­ment.”</p>
    <p>One should not chase prod­ucts, but in­stead view fi­nan­cial man­age­ment in its en­tirety.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial man­age­ment has to be based on a foun­da­tion of good fi­nan­cial health. Be­fore we make any in­vest­ment de­ci­sions, we need to do some es­sen­tial things. We need to do a bud­get, keep our ex­penses low, con­trol our debt lev­els and save to­wards an emer­gency fund.”</p>
    <p>PRO­TEC­TION</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must take mea­sures to pro­tect their in­come against life risks such as death, dis­abil­ity or med­i­cal cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Our most im­por­tant fi­nan­cial as­set is not our house, or our in­vest­ments, but ac­tu­ally our abil­ity to gen­er­ate the in­come from which we can save and in­vest.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans spend a l ot of money on in­sur­ance, but many are still un­der pro­tected, prob­a­bly be­cause they’ve been sold un­suit­able or ex­pen­sive in­sur­ance prod­ucts. At Money Owl, we al­ways ad­vo­cate term in­sur­ance and fit for pur­pose prod­ucts. So the idea is to buy as much pro­tec­tion as you need, and pay as lit­tle as you can.”</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL HEALTH CHECK</p>
    <p>This in­volves check­ing if the per­son has six months of emer­gency funds. The next thing is to check debt lev­els.</p>
    <p>“A cri­sis is a good time to take a hard look at what you re­ally need and what you don’t need – es­pe­cially among your vari­able ex­penses. You could re­struc­ture some of your in­sur­ance. But be cau­tious as we don’t want you to lose cov­er­age. Also, maybe there’s a cheaper way of do­ing some things. For in­stance, in­stead of in­di­vid­ual tu­ition for the chil­dren, con­sider group tu­ition. So th­ese are ac­tu­ally very prac­ti­cal tips.”</p>
    <p>Money Owl re­cently rolled out a se­ries of fi­nan­cial re­silience work­shops, which are free and can be signed up on its web­site. Its fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy train­ers – who are all cer­ti­fied fi­nan­cial plan­ners – will go through some of th­ese tips about debt man­age­ment and where to get help as well.</p>
    <p>THE USE OF CPF</p>
    <p>“Do not in­vest your CPF Spe­cial Ac­count money. At Money Owl, we are quite firm on this be­cause at 4 to 5 per cent risk free, it is not worth tak­ing the risk in the mar­kets. So keep your Spe­cial Ac­count money and let it com­pound to­wards your re­tire­ment sum. The CPF Or­di­nary Ac­count pays 2.5 per cent in­ter­est. And yes, if you do it cor­rectly, you can get a higher long-term re­turn but there are some con­di­tions. You must in­vest in low-cost, glob­ally di­ver­si­fied funds that do not time the mar­ket and you must be able to stay in­vested over the long term.”</p>
    <p>Funds in the Or­di­nary Ac­count can be a buf­fer to pay your monthly mort­gage dur­ing un­cer­tain eco­nomic times like th­ese.</p>
    <p>“If you lose your job or suf­fer a pay cut, cash be­comes very pre­cious. And when cash be­comes pre­cious, you want to con­serve cash for your daily ex­penses. So your</p>
    <p>CPF can come in use­ful, like an emer­gency fund, to pay your monthly mort­gage. If there’s an ob­vi­ous risk of a job loss, it is not worth­while chas­ing ex­tra re­turns. You may be forced to liq­ui­date at a loss if you need those funds to pay your mort­gage.</p>
    <p>“There is much more to fi­nan­cial man­age­ment than just in­vest­ing or get­ting a prod­uct. In fact, when it comes to fi­nan­cial well­ness and peace of mind it is re­ally best to start from a com­pre­hen­sive ap­proach.”</p>
