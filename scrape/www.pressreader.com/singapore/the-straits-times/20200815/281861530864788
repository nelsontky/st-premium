    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ac­cused the Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute US Cen­tre (CIUS), which over­sees lan­guage and cul­tural cen­tres across the United States, of be­ing part of Bei­jing’s “global in­flu­ence and pro­pa­ganda ap­pa­ra­tus” when it an­nounced that the CIUS will have to be reg­is­tered as a for­eign mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Dis­con­tent over the lan­guage and cul­tural cen­tres’ al­leged role in ad­vanc­ing Bei­jing’s global pro­pa­ganda cam­paign has long sim­mered in the US, but Thurs­day’s for­mal des­ig­na­tion comes amid a sharp down­turn in US-China ties in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The des­ig­na­tion usu­ally ap­plies to agen­cies in­volved in diplo­matic and con­sular ac­tiv­i­ties. CIUS will now have to keep Wash­ing­ton ap­prised of its staff, prop­erty, fund­ing and cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>This would give the State De­part­ment a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of how the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment “uses its net­work of Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes and class­rooms in the US to in­flu­ence Amer­i­can schol­ars”, Act­ing Di­rec­tor of the Of­fice of For­eign Mis­sions Clifton Sea­groves told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Re­act­ing to the move, the CIUS said it was more than happy to re­spond to the State De­part­ment’s in­for­ma­tion re­quests, but dis­agreed with its des­ig­na­tion as a for­eign mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The CIUS said it was not a head­quar­ters for Amer­i­can Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes, and was in no way in­volved in any Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute cur­ricu­lum, em­ploy­ment or fund­ing.</p>
    <p>“CIUS has no in­flu­ence, let alone ‘ma­lign’ in­flu­ence, over how uni­ver­si­ties run and man­age their own Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute lan­guage pro­grammes,” it said on its web­site.</p>
    <p>“We know there are a lot of press­ing is­sues be­tween our two coun­tries – Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes are not one of them and we are work­ing hard to keep it that way,” it added.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for East Asian and Pa­cific Af­fairs David Stil­well clar­i­fied dur­ing the brief­ing that the US was not clos­ing down Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute cen­tres, but high­light­ing their ties to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP).</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said: “The goal of these ac­tions is sim­ple: to en­sure that Amer­i­can ed­u­ca­tors and school ad­min­is­tra­tors can make in­formed choices about whether these CCP-backed pro­grammes should be al­lowed to con­tinue, and if so, in what fash­ion.”</p>
    <p>CIUS ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Gao Qing told The Straits Times: “Ap­par­ently, we are liv­ing in a time where teach­ing a for­eign lan­guage is seen as a po­lit­i­cal act by some peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>It was ironic that his “small team of Amer­i­can staff” is be­ing de­fined as a for­eign mis­sion, he added.</p>
    <p>Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute cen­tres were set up to teach the Chi­nese lan­guage and pro­mote Chi­nese cul­ture. Its head­quar­ters in Bei­jing – the Han­ban – is af­fil­i­ated with</p>
    <p>China’s Education Min­istry.</p>
    <p>There are 75 Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute cen­tres in the US, in­clud­ing 65 on univer­sity cam­puses, with the rest func­tion­ing as stan­dalone or­gan­i­sa­tions, said Mr Stil­well. This com­prises nearly a fifth of the more than 480 such cen­tres around the world, in­clud­ing one in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Some 45 Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes have shut in the US since 2014, based on data from the National As­so­ci­a­tion of Schol­ars (NAS), a non­profit group.</p>
    <p>Many of the clo­sures were due to a law passed last year, which forced schools to choose be­tween re­ceiv­ing funds for Chi­nese lan­guage classes from Wash­ing­ton un­der the De­fence De­part­ment’s Lan­guage Flag­ship pro­gramme and from Bei­jing via its Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cially doc­u­mented ev­i­dence of for­eign in­flu­ence ac­tiv­i­ties by the in­sti­tutes has been mixed.</p>
    <p>A Fe­bru­ary 2019 re­port by the US Gov­ern­ment Ac­count­abil­ity Of­fice watch­dog, which re­viewed 10 Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute cen­tres, found that all of them were headed by US school staff and not Chi­nese gov­ern­ment staff.</p>
    <p>While some school of­fi­cials and re­searchers told the watch­dog they were con­cerned that host­ing a Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute could limit aca­demic free­dom, oth­ers said their cen­tres had hosted events on sen­si­tive top­ics, such as the South China Sea ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes.</p>
    <p>A 2017 re­port by the NAS found that some of the in­sti­tute’s fac­ulty mem­bers face pres­sure to self-cen­sor. Some uni­ver­si­ties also had fi­nan­cial in­cen­tives not to crit­i­cise China.</p>
    <p>His­tory pro­fes­sor Ed­ward McCord of Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity (GWU), which has hosted a Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute since 2013, told The Straits Times the al­le­ga­tion that the cen­tres pro­moted Chi­nese pro­pa­ganda was “a com­mon charge, but lacks any con­crete ev­i­dence”.</p>
    <p>He cited a 2019 study by the Cal­i­for­nia-based Hoover In­sti­tu­tion think-tank, which care­fully ex­am­ined ma­te­ri­als pro­vided from China to the cen­tres and found no ev­i­dence of pro­pa­ganda.</p>
    <p>GWU’s Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute op­er­ates with no in­ter­fer­ence from China, he said, adding that it of­fers Chi­nese lan­guage classes and sup­ports fac­ulty re­search.</p>
    <p>“It is very hard to see the ma­lign in­flu­ence that they (the State De­part­ment) claim oc­curs. It should be their re­spon­si­bil­ity to pro­vide ev­i­dence, not just re­peat un­sup­ported charges,” Prof McCord said.</p>
    <p>Mr Stil­well had ac­cused China of tak­ing ad­van­tage of the US’ free speech and aca­demic free­dom.</p>
    <p>He said: “Our goal is to get the other side to un­der­stand the im­por­tance of trans­parency and open­ness and shar­ing, but un­til that hap­pens, we’re go­ing to take steps to de­fend our­selves.”</p>
