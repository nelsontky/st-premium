    <p>The Pickup Game, a doc­u­men­tary de­but­ing on the stream­ing ser­vice iwon­der to­mor­row, lifts the lid on a bil­lion-dol­lar busi­ness: the coach­ing in­dus­try run by so-called “pickup artists”, who prom­ise to teach men how to ma­nip­u­late women into bed.</p>
    <p>These coaches ply their trade all over the world at sem­i­nars and boot camps where stu­dents pay US$1,000 (S$1,360) to US$3,000 each.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies they work for earn mil­lions from these and on­line cour­ses, even though the in­dus­try has been be­set by scan­dal and controvers­y since its ac­tiv­i­ties be­came known.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Swiss-Amer­i­can coach Julien Blanc was banned from en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore and con­duct­ing such sem­i­nars af­ter his rep­re­hen­si­ble tac­tics with women sur­faced on­line.</p>
    <p>In a tele­phone in­ter­view from Bri­tain, Bri­tish-Cana­dian film­mak­ers and broth­ers Matthew and Barn­aby O’Con­nor spoke to The Straits Times about their ex­pose of Blanc and oth­ers like him in The</p>
    <p>Pickup Game. Shot un­der­cover in more than 10 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Bri­tain, Ja­pan, the United States and Aus­tralia, it looks at what makes the pickup artist com­mu­nity tick.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>IT IS A GLOBAL IN­DUS­TRY THOUGHT TO BE WORTH OVER US$1 BIL­LION</p>
    <p>The pickup artist com­mu­nity is thought to have orig­i­nated with Amer­i­can dat­ing guru Ross Jef­fries, who is in­ter­viewed in the film.</p>
    <p>Jef­fries gained no­to­ri­ety teach­ing se­duc­tion techniques such as neu­rolin­guis­tic pro­gram­ming, which claims to be able to ma­nip­u­late be­hav­iour through speech.</p>
    <p>This grew into a sub­cul­ture that gained main­stream at­ten­tion when jour­nal­ist Neil Strauss wrote a best­selling book about it, The Game: Pen­e­trat­ing The Se­cret So­ci­ety Of Pickup Artists, in 2005.</p>
    <p>That book is how the O’Con­nors, like many, learnt of pickup artists.</p>
    <p>“When you dis­cover that there’s this world and that peo­ple pay an ex­tor­tion­ate amount of money for what is ef­fec­tively snake oil, it’s quite an un­be­liev­able story,” says Barn­aby O’Con­nor, 41.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>SOME PICK­UPS ARE STAGED</p>
    <p>The coaches – who work for or­gan­i­sa­tions such as Real So­cial Dy­nam­ics, which bills it­self as “the world’s largest dat­ing coach­ing com­pany” – will demon­strate their se­duc­tion techniques to their stu­dents, ei­ther on video or when they take them out for prac­tice runs at bars and other places.</p>
    <p>But the film re­veals that some of the women have been paid to act like they are re­spond­ing well to the ad­vances.</p>
    <p>Matthew O’Con­nor, 43, de­cided to make the doc­u­men­tary in part be­cause he met a woman paid to be a “con­ver­sa­tion girl” – some­one with whom the stu­dents can prac</p>
    <p>tise the chat­ting-up techniques they learn.</p>
    <p>“I was work­ing on a music video and met a woman work­ing for one of the pickup com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents would learn con­ver­sa­tion techniques, then go to her to prac­tise, and she would give them feed­back.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>THESE TECHNIQUES CAN WORK</p>
    <p>The film shows the play­book of se­duc­tion techniques as ma­nip­u­la­tive and the coach­ing in­dus­try as ex­ploita­tive, both of its male stu­dents and their fe­male tar­gets.</p>
    <p>But a fe­male dat­ing coach in­ter­viewed points out that these meth­ods can work on women with in­se­cu­ri­ties or those who are putting on an act them­selves.</p>
    <p>Matthew says: “Part of the prob­lem is every­body likes to think that they can’t be fooled. The dis­turb­ing re­al­ity is that these techniques do work on peo­ple who are vul­ner­a­ble or have self-es­teem is­sues.”</p>
    <p>But he feels any­one who prac­tises these meth­ods is not do­ing him­self or her­self any favours.</p>
    <p>“If you are ap­ply­ing these techniques and you’re not be­ing sin­cere, in the long run, you will suf­fer be­cause you’re not form­ing gen­uine con­nec­tions with peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>THE MEN WHO PAY FOR THESE SER­VICES DO NOT NEED THEM</p>
    <p>When asked what he hopes view­ers take from the film, Matthew says: “One of the mes­sages we wanted to get across to men was, ‘You al­ready have so much more go­ing for you than you re­alise.’”</p>
    <p>“Guys of­ten feel they have to show off or act a cer­tain way in front of women and that’s sim­ply not true,” he ob­serves.</p>
    <p>“Many stu­dents we met were miss­ing only one thing: an el­e­ment of self-be­lief.</p>
    <p>“They al­ready had ev­ery­thing they needed to be funny and en­gag­ing, and to find some­one who liked them for who they were – they just didn’t re­alise it.”</p>
