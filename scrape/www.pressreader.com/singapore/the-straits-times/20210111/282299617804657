    <p>I think (an­i­mals vis­it­ing cities) shows the ex­tent to which hu­man com­mu­ni­ties have in­creas­ingly taken up space that maybe had been wilder­ness not that long ago, maybe a gen­er­a­tion or two ago.</p>
    <p>NANYANG TECH­NO­LOG­I­CAL UNIVER­SITY BOTANIST SHAWN LUM, on wildlife spot­ted dur­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple stayed home amid the global Covid-19 lock­downs early last year, the streets and town cen­tres be­came play ar­eas and hunt­ing grounds for droves of an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>In March, a gang of Kash­miri goats ven­tured into a Welsh town, hop­ping over brick walls and nib­bling at hedges.</p>
    <p>In the coastal city of Mar del Plata in Ar­gentina in April, sea lions en­joyed a siesta in the mid­dle of a street near the port.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, a fam­ily of ot­ters were spot­ted frol­ick­ing on the empty streets out­side Mustafa Cen­tre in April dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“I think (an­i­mals vis­it­ing cities) shows the ex­tent to which hu­man com­mu­ni­ties have in­creas­ingly taken up space that maybe had been wilder­ness not that long ago, maybe a gen­er­a­tion or two ago,” said Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) botanist Shawn Lum.</p>
    <p>Although this high­lights the ex­tent of the hu­man foot­print, it also shows that wildlife “has enough re­silience to come back and try to re­claim or oc­cupy some of that space from which it prob­a­bly once oc­curred”, added Dr Lum, who is from NTU’s Asian School of the En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>This bat­tle for space has con­tin­ued amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of wild­fires in Brazil last year, the high­est in a decade.</p>
    <p>In some parts, it was marked by il­le­gal poach­ing, log­ging and wild­fires across na­tional parks and rain­forests.</p>
    <p>Vil­lagers left job­less by In­dia’s lock­down i n March turned to poach­ing to earn money and feed their fam­i­lies, ac­cord­ing to re­ports.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Fe­bru­ary and May last year, as vis­i­tor num­bers dropped, the Uganda Wildlife Au­thor­ity recorded 367 poach­ing in­ci­dents in the na­tion’s na­tional parks.</p>
    <p>“When Covid-19 keeps peo­ple away, it also keeps law en­force­ment away, and that is a nice vacuum for poach­ers and other il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties to move in,” Dr Lum pointed out.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, South Amer­ica is on fire. As the virus out­break led to a cut­back in mon­i­tor­ing and en­force­ment ef­forts in the Ama­zon rain­for­est, the scale of il­le­gal log­ging and min­ing in­creased last year.</p>
    <p>Com­pounded by the re­gion’s worst drought in nearly half a cen­tury and the Brazil gov­ern­ment’s sup­port for de­for­esta­tion, the num­ber of wild­fires in the coun­try reached its high­est in a decade last year, at more than 222,000.</p>
    <p>As a gi­ant car­bon sink, the rag­ing flames that tore through the Ama­zon do not do sus­tain­abil­ity any favours.</p>
    <p>The degra­da­tion of na­ture can in­crease the risk of fu­ture pan­demics as wildlife-hu­man con­tact may cause the spillover of new diseases, a re­cent re­port by the In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Sci­ence-Pol­icy Plat­form on Bio­di­ver­sity and Ecosys­tem Ser­vices (Ipbes) said.</p>
    <p>The driv­ers of such degra­da­tion in­clude changes in land use, agri­cul­tural ex­pan­sion and wildlife trade.</p>
    <p>The au­thors noted that an es­ti­mated 1.7 mil­lion undis­cov­ered viruses may ex­ist in mam­mals and birds.</p>
    <p>Of those, up to 827,000 might be able to in­fect humans.</p>
    <p>But “blam­ing wildlife for the emer­gence of diseases is er­ro­neous, be­cause emer­gence is caused by hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties and their i mpacts on the en­vi­ron­ment”, the Ipbes re­port, which was re­leased last Oc­to­ber, said.</p>
    <p>The au­thors sug­gested that there should be more ef­fort to pre­vent pan­demics, in­stead of con­trol­ling diseases after they oc­cur, which is 100 times costlier to man­age.</p>
    <p>Work must be done to pre­dict the ori­gins of fu­ture out­breaks, iden­tify hosts and high-risk pathogens, as well as pre­vent the ex­ploita­tion of bio­di­verse re­gions, the re­port sug­gested.</p>
