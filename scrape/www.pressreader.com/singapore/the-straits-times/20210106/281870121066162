    <p>SYD­NEY • Wik­iLeaks founder Ju­lian As­sange is “free to re­turn home” to Aus­tralia once le­gal chal­lenges against him are dealt with, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said yes­ter­day, af­ter a Bri­tish court de­nied a re­quest to ex­tra­dite As­sange to the United States.</p>
    <p>A Bri­tish judge on Mon­day blocked the ex­tra­di­tion re­quest by the US, where As­sange was set to face crim­i­nal charges in­clud­ing break­ing a spy­ing law, say­ing his men­tal health prob­lems meant he would be at risk of sui­cide.</p>
    <p>The US Jus­tice Depart­ment said it would con­tinue to seek As­sange’s ex­tra­di­tion with pros­e­cu­tors set to ap­peal to Lon­don’s High Court.</p>
    <p>“Well, the jus­tice sys­tem is mak­ing its way and we’re not a party to that. And like any Aus­tralian, they’re of­fered con­sular sup­port and should, you know, the ap­peal fail, ob­vi­ously he would be able to re­turn to Aus­tralia like any other Aus­tralian,” Mr Mor­ri­son told lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion 2GB yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“So, yes, it’s just a straight­for­ward process of the le­gal sys­tem in the UK work­ing its way through.”</p>
    <p>As­sange, 49, is ac­cused by Amer­i­can of­fi­cials of 18 of­fences dur­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tion of for­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama re­lat­ing to the re­lease by Wik­iLeaks of con­fi­den­tial US mil­i­tary records and diplo­matic ca­bles that they say put lives at risk.</p>
    <p>But his sup­port­ers see him as an anti-es­tab­lish­ment hero who was vic­timised for ex­pos­ing US wrong­do­ing in Afghanista­n and Iraq, and say his pros­e­cu­tion is po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Wik­iLeaks came to promi­nence when it pub­lished a US mil­i­tary video in 2010 show­ing a 2007 at­tack by Apache he­li­copters in Bagh­dad that killed a dozen peo­ple, in­clud­ing two Reuters news staff.</p>
    <p>It then re­leased thou­sands of se­cret clas­si­fied files and diplo­matic ca­bles.</p>
    <p>Mex­ico on Mon­day of­fered po­lit­i­cal asy­lum to As­sange, a move that could anger Washington.</p>
