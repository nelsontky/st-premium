    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The long-de­layed Friends re­union spe­cial is ex­pected to shoot in March, ac­tor Matthew Perry said on Thurs­day, a year af­ter plans to get the cast back to­gether were wrecked be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Friends re­union be­ing resched­uled for the be­gin­ning of March. Looks like we have a busy year com­ing up. And that’s the way I like it,” Perry, 51, tweeted.</p>
    <p>The one-off un­scripted spe­cial was sup­posed to launch the HBO Max stream­ing ser­vice in May this year, but plans to film it have been re­peat­edly de­layed by the pan­demic that shut down pro­duc­tion in Hol­ly­wood in mid-March.</p>
    <p>A source close to the pro­duc­tion said on Thurs­day that plans were still be­ing fi­nalised, but that the first part of next year was the tar­get date for the tap­ing.</p>
    <p>Friends (1994 to 2004) also starred Jen­nifer Anis­ton, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, David Sch­wim­mer and Matt LeBlanc as six friends in their 20s and 30s liv­ing in New York City.</p>
    <p>The sit­com ended in 2004 af­ter 10 years, but it re­mains one of the most pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion shows in re­runs.</p>
    <p>HBO Max said ear­lier this year it hoped to film the re­union in the stu­dio with a live au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood movies and tele­vi­sion shows have slowly re­sumed pro­duc­tion un­der com­plex safety guide­lines that in­clude so­cial dis­tanc­ing, fre­quent test­ing for casts and crews and Covid-19 ad­vis­ers on sets.</p>
