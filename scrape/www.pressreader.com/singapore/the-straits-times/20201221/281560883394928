    <p>All 19 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day were im­ported.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from for­eign work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,422.</p>
    <p>All the new cases were among those al­ready placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore when they were tested, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among them are two Sin­ga­pore­ans and three per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) who re­turned from Bri­tain and In­dia.</p>
    <p>There is one work pass holder and one work per­mit holder who are both work­ing here, and had ar­rived from Rus­sia and In­done­sia re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>There are also three long-term visit pass hold­ers who ar­rived from In­dia, and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder who ar­rived from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>An­other four cases are on short­term visit passes.</p>
    <p>Of these, one was al­ready re­ceiv­ing med­i­cal care in Sin­ga­pore and had re­turned for fur­ther treat­ment. The pa­tient was ac­com­pa­nied by his care­giver who also tested pos­i­tive. The re­main­ing two are vis­it­ing their fam­ily mem­bers here who are Sin­ga­pore­ans or PRs.</p>
    <p>The last four of the 19 cases are crew mem­bers of a ship which ar­rived from In­done­sia. They had re­mained on the ship un­til they were taken to a quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity as they had been iden­ti­fied as close con­tacts of an ear­lier case.</p>
    <p>Only one of the 19 new cases was symp­to­matic. MOH said epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress. Mean­while, all iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the cases have been iso­lated and quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so that asymp­to­matic cases can be de­tected, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Sero­log­i­cal tests for close con­tacts will also be con­ducted to de­ter­mine if the cases could have been in­fected by them, MOH said.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With five cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,264 pa­tients have re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>There are 43 pa­tients still in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, and 71 pa­tients are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from for­eign work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>All the new cases were among those al­ready placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore when they were tested, said the Min­istry of Health yes­ter­day.</p>
