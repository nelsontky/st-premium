    <p>• Asian mar­kets strug­gled and the US dol­lar ex­tended losses yes­ter­day on data show­ing the US econ­omy suf­fered its worst quar­ter on record, while a tweet from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump sug­gest­ing de­lay­ing the Novem­ber elec­tion also jolted in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures from Wash­ing­ton added to fears about the long-run­ning eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19 and over­shad­owed a bet­ter-thanfore­cast read on Chi­nese fac­tory ac­tiv­ity that sug­gested China is slowly emerg­ing from the pan­demic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Wall Street’s S&P 500 and Dow dropped fol­low­ing the dour US read­ings, while Frank­furt led steep losses in Europe af­ter Ger­many an­nounced that the re­gion’s big­gest econ­omy suf­fered a his­toric 10 per cent con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Tokyo yes­ter­day lost 2.82 per cent and Syd­ney 2.04 per cent, while Seoul and Taipei were also in the red. Sin­ga­pore was closed for a pub­lic hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong dipped 0.47 per cent but Shang­hai edged up af­ter China said its closely watched Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex on man­u­fac­tur­ing im­proved for the sec­ond straight month.</p>
    <p>The al­ready strug­gling US dol­lar took an­other step down across the board fol­low­ing the data.</p>
    <p>The euro, helped by last month’s mas­sive Euro­pean Union stim­u­lus deal, built on its re­cent ad­vance to sit at highs not seen since May 2018, while the yen – a tra­di­tional go-to unit in times of tur­moil – was at its strong­est level since March.</p>
    <p>The US Fed­eral Re­serve’s mas­sive eas­ing pro­gramme, which has driven in­ter­est rates to zero, has played a key role in the US dol­lar’s weak­ness, with high-yield­ing cur­ren­cies such as the Aus­tralian dol­lar, South Korean won and Mex­i­can peso also ben­e­fit­ing.</p>
    <p>And expectatio­ns are for the green­back to con­tinue to flail, with law­mak­ers in Wash­ing­ton un­able to find com­mon ground on a new sup­port pack­age.</p>
    <p>Ax­iCorp’s chief global mar­ket strate­gist Stephen Innes said: “There is lit­tle rea­son for the dol­lar to re­cover in an en­vi­ron­ment where more and more in­vestors in ac­cel­er­at­ing fash­ion throw aside the pre­vi­ously es­tab­lished as­sump­tion that the US will lead the re­cov­ery to global eco­nomic nir­vana.”</p>
    <p>Traders were also rat­tled by Mr Trump’s sug­ges­tion that the elec­tion should be de­layed ow­ing to the risk of fraud by mail-in votes.</p>
    <p>While he would be un­likely to get the sup­port of both houses of Con­gress, the out­burst pricked in­vestors’ ears.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray At­trill of Na­tional Aus­tralia Bank said: “The mere sug­ges­tion by Trump of a de­lay nev­er­the­less does play to con­cerns that the elec­tion re­sult will be chal­lenged in Novem­ber and that, be­cause of the likely larger-than-usual share of votes via mail-in bal­lots due to the pan­demic, we might not know the re­sult on elec­tion night it­self.”</p>
