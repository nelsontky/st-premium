    <p>LON­DON • More than 100 high­pro­file par­ents, from tech en­tre­pre­neur Martha Lane-Fox to fash­ion de­signer Vivi­enne West­wood, urged Bri­tain’s govern­ment yes­ter­day to en­sure eco­nomic re­cov­ery from the pan­demic tack­les cli­mate change and puts chil­dren at its cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The 115 busi­ness lead­ers, mu­si­cians, sci­en­tists, ac­tors and cam­paign­ers used an open let­ter to urge Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son not to “build our way out of one dis­as­ter by su­per-charg­ing the next”.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Julie Wal­ters, who was among the sig­na­to­ries, said gov­ern­ments should ramp up their ef­forts to tackle cli­mate change, in the same way they have re­sponded to pro­tect peo­ple from Covid-19. “For the sake of our chil­dren, we need gov­ern­ments to put the same en­ergy and in­vest­ment into pre­vent­ing an even greater cli­mate catas­tro­phe from un­fold­ing across the globe,” she said.</p>
    <p>If planet-warm­ing emis­sions re­bound to pre-pan­demic lev­els, it would have “cat­a­strophic con­se­quences for chil­dren’s lives and liveli­hoods”, the let­ter warned, with those from the poor­est and most dis­ad­van­taged com­mu­ni­ties be­ing hit hard­est.</p>
    <p>Spend­ing on green mea­sures – like boost­ing re­new­able en­ergy, in­su­lat­ing homes, in­stalling elec­tric-ve­hi­cle charg­ing points and re-es­tab­lish­ing wood­lands – would cre­ate more and bet­ter jobs than re­build­ing a fos­sil-fuel econ­omy, it said.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple have been most likely to lose their jobs or see their in­comes drop dur­ing the virus lock­down, it noted.</p>
    <p>“In­vest­ing in a low-car­bon re­cov­ery makes sense whether you are wor­ried about the econ­omy or the en­vi­ron­ment. The two are in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked,” said former chief ex­ec­u­tive of Unilever Paul Pol­man, who signed the let­ter.</p>
    <p>Ms Rosamund Kissi-De­brah, who has cam­paigned to have the 2013 death of her nine-year-old daugh­ter from asthma of­fi­cially linked to il­le­gal lev­els of air pol­lu­tion, said she hoped that as a fa­ther with a baby, PM John­son would un­der­stand the im­pact.</p>
    <p>“This is not an elit­ist con­ver­sa­tion. Air pol­lu­tion af­fects the poor­est and vul­ner­a­ble the most, and we need to con­tinue the fight,” Ms Kissi-De­brah, who is the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s ad­vo­cate for health and air qual­ity, told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion.</p>
