    <p>LON­DON • Arse­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta has urged his side to use to­day’s League Cup quar­ter-fi­nal against hold­ers Manch­ester City as a cat­a­lyst to turn their for­tunes around and sal­vage their sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners have lost five of their last seven Premier League games and lie in 15th place with 14 points, mark­ing their worst start to a sea­son since 1974-75.</p>
    <p>But vic­tory at the Emi­rates could ease some pres­sure on Arteta, who is fight­ing to stay in the job as sack ru­mours grow louder.</p>
    <p>“This is what we want to use it for. This is a com­pe­ti­tion that we want to try to win,” the Spa­niard said at his vir­tual news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day. “We had two dif­fi­cult (League Cup) op­po­nents be­fore with Le­ices­ter and Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“We man­aged to beat them both and now we’re one step closer to Wem­b­ley. It’s a re­ally nice game for us to play be­cause it’s the type of game we’re look­ing for through the sea­son.”</p>
    <p>In­sist­ing he still had the back­ing of the Arse­nal board de­spite Bri­tish me­dia link­ing for­mer Ju­ven­tus man­ager Mas­si­m­il­iano Al­le­gri with his job, Arteta said: “Within the club, my feel­ing is just sup­port, en­cour­age­ment and to­tal con­fi­dence we’re go­ing to get through this to­gether.</p>
    <p>“A club of this stature de­serves the best and when it’s not hap­pen­ing, ev­ery­one is go­ing to ques­tion it. I’m re­spon­si­ble in terms of re­sults so I have to ac­cept that.”</p>
    <p>Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang, who missed the league de­feat at Ever­ton on Satur­day, will be ab­sent again due to a calf in­jury but Arteta is hope­ful his cap­tain will make a quick re­turn.</p>
    <p>“He was more pos­i­tive yes­ter­day than the pre­vi­ous two days. He will have an­other scan and we will see how quickly we can get him back in the team,” he added. “He knows how im­por­tant he is for us.”</p>
    <p>Un­like Arse­nal, City are not floun­der­ing in the league but the goal-shy team are still per­form­ing be­low ex­pec­ta­tions this term.</p>
    <p>To­day’s vis­i­tors have scored only twice in their last three league games and just 19 over­all.</p>
    <p>Poor form and in­juries have plagued Gabriel Je­sus and Ser­gio Aguero re­spec­tively. The Brazil­ian has just two league goals while the lat­ter has made only three ap­pear­ances in the league this term.</p>
    <p>Both for­wards did not fea­ture in Satur­day’s win at Southampto­n. While Je­sus is set to re­turn against Arse­nal, City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola con­firmed Aguero, an un­used sub­sti­tute at St Mary’s, will again be ab­sent. The Cata­lan also ad­mit­ted City had no plans to dip into the trans­fer mar­ket when it opens next month as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has cur­tailed their bud­get for a new striker.</p>
    <p>Asked about the prospect of new faces, he said yes­ter­day: “No I don’t think so be­cause the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion around the world is what it is. All the clubs strug­gle, we are not an ex­cep­tion.”</p>
    <p>On their scor­ing woes, he replied: “We are cre­at­ing clear chances that we can­not score and when this hap­pens we are al­ways go­ing to suf­fer. That’s why I’m not able to say how we will be this sea­son. Game by game is the only thing I can do and now we go to Lon­don to play Arse­nal in the League Cup.”</p>
