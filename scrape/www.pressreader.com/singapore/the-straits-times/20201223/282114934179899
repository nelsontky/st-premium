    <p>THE YEAR EX-WORK­ERS’ PARTY LEADER LOW THIA KHIANG BE­GAN PLAN­NING FOR HIS RE­TIRE­MENT, AC­CORD­ING TO A BOOK BY FOR­MER NCMP YEE JENN JONG</p>
    <p>For­mer Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Low Thia Khiang’s de­ci­sion not to con­test this year’s elec­tions was not sparked by a se­ri­ous fall at home, ac­cord­ing to a new book by WP mem­ber and for­mer Non-Con­stituency MP Yee Jenn Jong.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran politi­cian’s plan to step down was hatched from as early as 2016, fol­low­ing a chal­lenge to his long-time lead­er­ship of Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ing op­po­si­tion party.</p>
    <p>This and other lesser-known facts are de­scribed in Jour­ney In Blue: A Peek Into The Work­ers’ Party Of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It chron­i­cles Mr Yee’s po­lit­i­cal jour­ney and goes some way to­wards cast­ing light on the in­ner work­ings of the party, known for keep­ing a tight lid on its af­fairs.</p>
    <p>On the chal­lenge to Mr Low’s lead­er­ship, Mr Yee re­veals that a group of mem­bers felt the party’s MPs had mis­han­dled mat­ters at Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil, which in­volved fi­nan­cial and gov­er­nance lapses. This and other fac­tors cre­ated the light­ning rod for the ouster.</p>
    <p>Mr Yee writes: “There was al­ways a seg­ment un­happy with Low, but they needed a leader with a chance to over­throw him. Their camp was too small in num­bers. They needed at least an MP-level can­di­date to root from be­hind to win oth­ers over.”</p>
    <p>The fac­tion co­a­lesced be­hind Mr Low’s fel­low Alju­nied GRC MP Chen Show Mao, who faced Mr Low in the party’s in­ter­nal elec­tions. The mood was tense as the vote count was pro­jected on a big screen. Mr Low even­tu­ally pre­vailed with­out hav­ing to vote for him­self – hold­ing up his un­used bal­lot for all to see.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times on Mon­day, Mr Yee de­murred on the im­pact of the episode on the re­la­tion­ships between Mr Chen and the rest of the party lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>He said: “I didn’t feel dis­ap­pointed so I didn’t feel a need to ask him why he chal­lenged.”</p>
    <p>Mr Low stepped down as party chief in 2018, but re­tired from elec­toral pol­i­tics ahead of the elec­tion this year.</p>
    <p>With party elec­tions com­ing up on Sun­day, Mr Yee said he be­lieved cur­rent leader Pri­tam Singh would not face any chal­lengers.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to a lack of po­lit­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion here, Mr Yee said he hoped his book will shed light on op­po­si­tion pol­i­tics and as­suage fears of join­ing the op­po­si­tion ranks or vot­ing against the in­cum­bent.</p>
    <p>He said his wife and par­ents found his de­ci­sion hard to ac­cept when he joined the WP in 2011 to run in Joo Chiat. His dad pleaded: “I beg of you, I beg of you.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yee told The Straits Times: “It was most dif­fi­cult to have to say ‘no’ to him. I’ve al­ways had a mind of my own, but at their age, you just want as much as pos­si­ble to com­ply with what they want. But I couldn’t do it, not af­ter I had promised the party and been put for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yee did well enough in the 2011 elec­tion to gain an NCMP seat.</p>
    <p>The book also pro­vides an in­sight into how the WP scru­ti­nises gov­ern­ment pol­icy and the pas­sage of leg­is­la­tion, through bod­ies such as a pol­icy group. It was headed by for­mer NCMP and univer­sity don Daniel Goh, who left pol­i­tics ear­lier this year for health rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Mr Yee re­counts ma­jor par­lia­men­tary de­bates, in­clud­ing over the AHTC mat­ter. He writes: “It was rather painful for me, watch­ing the en­tire de­bate as the PAP rained one blow af­ter an­other in this mod­ern-day glad­i­a­tor arena.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yee, who says he will not con­test fu­ture elec­tions, was part of the WP’s Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC team in 2015 and this year, though he says he would have pre­ferred to run in a sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion on where to field can­di­dates was largely made by Mr Low and party chair­man Sylvia Lim, he writes. He also de­scribes how both the top lead­ers had ob­jected to him in­volv­ing Ms Ni­cole Seah in house vis­its in the 2015 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Seah, a one-time Na­tional Sol­i­dar­ity Party can­di­date in Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC, had of­fered her help to Mr Yee in her per­sonal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>But Mr Low and Ms Lim vig­or­ously ob­jected, warn­ing it would de­tract from the WP’s cam­paign.</p>
    <p>In the end, Ms Seah was al­lowed to help only by dis­tribut­ing fliers in Opera Es­tate with Mr Yee’s daugh­ters. He wrote: “She was ob­vi­ously not happy.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the episode, Ms Seah even­tu­ally be­came a WP mem­ber and was fielded in East Coast GRC in this year’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked if his po­lit­i­cal ca­reer might have turned out dif­fer­ently if he had been fielded in the more high-pro­file con­stituen­cies or if he had been given more lee­way to run his own cam­paign, Mr Yee said he had no re­grets.</p>
    <p>“As a politi­cian in a po­lit­i­cal party, you are like a soldier. If you are picked to fight in an area, you just try to do your best,” he said.</p>
    <p>UNHAPPINES­S WITHIN PARTY</p>
