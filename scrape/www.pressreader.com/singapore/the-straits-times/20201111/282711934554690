    <p>Many lo­cal per­son­al­i­ties have paid trib­ute to ac­tress and singer Chen Meiguang, who died on Sun­day at the age of 87.</p>
    <p>Song­writer and xinyao pi­o­neer Liang Wern Fook wrote on Face­book: “Your song makes even an over­cast day bright. A lit­tle flower smiles at the sand­storm of time. A beau­ti­ful mem­ory will shine.”</p>
    <p>A Lit­tle Flower is an old song Chen is re­mem­bered for singing in her later years and Liang also made ref­er­ence to her name, which trans­lates lit­er­ally to “beau­ti­ful light”.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor and Teochew opera prac­ti­tioner Nick Shen posted a photo of him­self with Chen on Face­book, with the cap­tion: “Thank­ful to have had the good for­tune to play your son. Rest in peace.”</p>
    <p>They played mother and son in the short film Fil­ial Haven in 2015.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Zheng Geping also re­mem­bered Chen on his In­sta­gram page, writ­ing: “Will al­ways re­mem­ber your lovely smile, A Lit­tle Flower and Mys­tery.”</p>
    <p>Chen is known for act­ing in the supernatur­al se­ries Mys­tery (1988) – where she played a ghostly old woman – as well as dra­mas such as Le­gend Of The Eight Im­mor­tals (1998).</p>
    <p>A-list ac­tress Zoe Tay paid her re­spects in an In­sta­gram story, say­ing: “Dear Meiguang-jie (older sis­ter in Chi­nese), rest in peace.”</p>
    <p>Vet­eran ac­tress Li Yinzhu told the Chi­nese-lan­guage daily Lianhe Wan­bao that she had vis­ited Chen a few years ago with other artists. She re­mem­bered Chen as some­one who was kindly and smi­ley.</p>
    <p>Chen died a day af­ter she was di­ag­nosed with a cere­bral haem­or­rhage.</p>
    <p>Her son told Wan­bao that his mother re­gained con­scious­ness briefly and said that SBC, the pre­cur­sor of Me­di­a­corp, had asked her to go back to film tele­vi­sion shows. He said she had been suf­fer­ing from de­men­tia for the past two years.</p>
