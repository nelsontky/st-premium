    <p>Malaysia Air­lines (MAS) has told lessors that it will not be able to make pay­ments for air­craft af­ter next month un­less it re­ceives more money from state-run sovereign fund Khaz­anah.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Reuters, MAS is burn­ing US$84 mil­lion (S$114 mil­lion) in cash ev­ery month, but had only US$88 mil­lion of liq­uid­ity at end-Au­gust, plus an ad­di­tional US$139 mil­lion avail­able from Khaz­anah, its sole share­holder.</p>
    <p>Now, Khaz­anah has warned leas­ing com­pa­nies that it will stop fund­ing the air­line group, while its group chief ex­ec­u­tive Izham Is­mail has warned that it would have “no choice but to shut it down” if lessors de­cide against back­ing the re­struc­tur­ing plan.</p>
    <p>MAS is not the only Asia-Pa­cific car­rier in this predica­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, which is op­er­at­ing at less than 10 per cent ca­pac­ity now, is burn­ing cash to the tune of al­most $300 mil­lion ev­ery month. For­tu­nately, the group has man­aged to raise $11 bil­lion via a rights is­sue and se­cured loans.</p>
    <p>It has also tied up ad­di­tional credit lines, and can raise an ad­di­tional $6.2 bil­lion in manda­tory con­vert­ible bonds be­fore next June. This is the largest amount of funds raised by any Asian car­rier group.</p>
    <p>Given that in­ter­na­tional bor­ders re­main closed, it will have to ju­di­ciously man­age its cash.</p>
    <p>In Hong Kong, 73-year-old Swire Group-con­trolled Cathay Pa­cific, faced with a 90 per cent col­lapse in pas­sen­ger num­bers, has parked more than 40 per cent of its planes and is de­fer­ring de­liv­er­ies of larger planes as it mulls over switch­ing to a fleet of smaller air­craft with fewer busi­ness-class seats.</p>
    <p>Thai Air­ways, which is 48 per cent owned by the Thai gov­ern­ment, is in bank­ruptcy pro­ceed­ings af­ter de­fault­ing 85 bil­lion baht (S$3.7 bil­lion) and fac­ing 333 bil­lion baht in li­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Across the Asia-Pa­cific, a sim­i­lar dis­mal story pre­vails. Re­gional air­lines are all strug­gling to sur­vive amid a once-in-a-cen­tury pan­demic that has brought in­ter­na­tional air travel to a near stand­still.</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific’s in­ter­na­tional traf­fic is down 96 per cent year on year. Ca­pac­ity has dived 91 per cent and in­ter­na­tional load fac­tor is barely 35 per cent. Most car­ri­ers are op­er­at­ing at 10 per cent ca­pac­ity on in­ter­na­tional routes.</p>
    <p>Much ink has been spilt chron­i­cling their losses and strug­gles.</p>
    <p>While some air­lines have gov­ern­ment back­ing, this is still pre­cious tax­pay­ers’ funds which can be re­de­ployed else­where to save jobs and sup­port liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata), cit­ing poor virus con­tain­ment around the world, de­pressed busi­ness travel and lack of con­sumer con­fi­dence, does not ex­pect air travel to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els any time be­fore 2024. In the mean­time, it projects global air­lines will col­lec­tively lose some US$84.3 bil­lion this year, and an­other US$15.8 bil­lion next year.</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific car­ri­ers are star­ing at a loss of US$29 bil­lion this year.</p>
    <p>Iata has just warned that the global air­line in­dus­try will col­lec­tively burn through US$77 bil­lion in cash dur­ing the sec­ond half of this year (al­most US$13 bil­lion per month), and al­most US$6 bil­lion per month next year.</p>
    <p>The only bright spots have been coun­tries with huge do­mes­tic travel mar­kets, like China, where the re­turn to some sem­blance of nor­malcy has seen a surge in in­ter-city air travel.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s do­mes­tic pas­sen­ger traf­fic is down only 19 per cent year on year, while ca­pac­ity on do­mes­tic routes is down just 6 per cent, thanks largely to the gov­ern­ment’s abil­ity to roll out risk man­age­ment pro­ce­dures and bring the pan­demic un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Some level of do­mes­tic air travel has also started tak­ing off in Ja­pan, Aus­tralia, New Zealand and Viet­nam, while South Korea’s car­ri­ers – tra­di­tion­ally de­pen­dent on a high pro­por­tion of cargo busi­ness – seem to be marginally prof­itable.</p>
    <p>But as Mr Sub­has Menon, direc­tor-gen­eral of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Asia-Pa­cific Air­lines (AAPA) points out, hopes that in­ter­na­tional air travel will grad­u­ally re­turn in the sec­ond half of this year have proved to be pre­ma­ture.</p>
    <p>“Whilst there have been dis­cus­sions about air cor­ri­dors, travel bub­bles and green lanes, these have so far failed to take off due to their im­prac­ti­cal­ity and in­abil­ity to scale up to meet the rea­son­able ex­pec­ta­tions of trav­ellers,” he noted. “Progress is be­ing made on test­ing, con­tact trac­ing, wear­ing of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, mea­sures which are also ap­plied in the con­text of in­ter­na­tional air travel. Un­for­tu­nately, their adop­tion is nei­ther con­sis­tent nor co­or­di­nated amongst states.”</p>
    <p>While the cri­sis has left most of the re­gion’s car­ri­ers hang­ing by a fig­u­ra­tive fi­nan­cial thread, forc­ing them to shed pi­lots, cabin crew and other staff, the im­pact is also be­ing felt on the broader economies across this re­gion of some 4.4 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause ev­ery one job in avi­a­tion gen­er­ates 25 oth­ers in the wider econ­omy, be it tourism, travel, re­tail or trade.</p>
    <p>Ge­o­graph­i­cally vast Asia-Pa­cific de­pends on in­ter­na­tional air travel to sup­port ev­ery­thing, from trade and sup­ply chains to tourism and ba­sic con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Given that this di­verse re­gion is sep­a­rated by oceans, seas, moun­tains and other nat­u­ral bar­ri­ers, air travel has been crit­i­cal in keep­ing it con­nected, within it­self and to the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has shut­tered bor­ders and suf­fo­cated travel.</p>
    <p>“This cri­sis is not of avi­a­tion’s mak­ing,” said AAPA’s Mr Menon. “Nei­ther is it the only sec­tor af­fected. Yet, more than six months into the pan­demic, most in­ter­na­tional flights re­main grounded by bor­der clo­sures even as lock­downs are grad­u­ally eased. The eco­nomic con­se­quences of shut­downs are wide­spread, with job losses within and out­side the in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>But it does not need to be this way. Sin­ga­pore, for one, has started uni­lat­er­ally open­ing up its bor­ders to se­lected, deemed low-risk coun­tries such as Aus­tralia, New Zealand, Brunei and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>But such mea­sures have to be broad and bi­lat­eral to re­ally take off. For that to hap­pen, gov­ern­ments need to talk to each other and de­vise an ac­cept­able Asia-Pa­cific-wide risk as­sess­ment pro­to­col and test­ing regime to sup­port bor­ders re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>They should per­haps take a leaf out of the book of the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Dis­ease Pre­ven­tion and Con­trol, which has col­lated a strate­gic data­base per­tain­ing to the pan­demic in all mem­ber coun­tries and pro­vided risk as­sess­ment guid­ance for air­lines and trav­ellers in the euro zone.</p>
    <p>Other pub­lic health or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion in the US main­tain and use sim­i­lar data­bases and pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>No one wants to travel to an­other coun­try to be quar­an­tined for 14 days. That said, ev­i­dence-based and sci­en­tif­i­cally sup­ported test­ing regimes are the only way to grad­u­ally re­open bor­ders across the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, pro­to­cols can en­able coun­tries with sim­i­lar risk lev­els to al­low air travel be­tween them­selves, sub­ject to 48 hours pre-de­par­ture test­ing by cer­ti­fied med­i­cal au­thor­i­ties at their point of de­par­ture. Back­ing all of this would be ac­cu­rate con­tact trac­ing and ap­pro­pri­ate Covid-19 health­care in­fra­struc­ture in each coun­try.</p>
    <p>If all the boxes tick off, coun­tries should open their bor­ders – at least bi­lat­er­ally to be­gin with. A good ex­am­ple is the travel bub­ble just an­nounced be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Such a mea­sure has been en­dorsed by Iata.</p>
    <p>The global air­line body has called for the de­vel­op­ment and de­ploy­ment of rapid, ac­cu­rate, af­ford­able, easy-to-op­er­ate, scal­able and sys­tem­atic Covid-19 test­ing for all pas­sen­gers be­fore de­par­ture as an al­ter­na­tive to quar­an­tine mea­sures, in or­der to re-es­tab­lish global air con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Iata said it would work through the In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion and with health au­thor­i­ties to im­ple­ment this so­lu­tion quickly.</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries need to move be­yond state­ments of good faith and get their act to­gether. Ev­ery day, ev­ery week and ev­ery month of shut­tered bor­ders and grounded planes fur­ther strain their economies and stress their peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional iso­la­tion is not a sus­tain­able pol­icy for any state.</p>
