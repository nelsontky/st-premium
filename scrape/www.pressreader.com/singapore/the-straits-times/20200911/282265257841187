    <p>LONDON • Leeds are back in the Pre­mier League for the first time in 16 years with a style of play un­der ec­cen­tric man­ager Marcelo Bielsa that is as far re­moved from their his­toric “Dirty Leeds” im­age as it is pos­si­ble to get.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a long and var­ied ca­reer, the 65-year-old Ar­gen­tinian has de­ployed an ex­hil­a­rat­ing, whirl­wind brand of foot­ball de­signed to not let the op­po­si­tion breathe – al­though it risks leav­ing his own play­ers ex­hausted be­fore the end of the term.</p>
    <p>His teams in­vari­ably de­ploy a high press and at­tack us­ing quick, ver­ti­cal passes, with his two sea­sons at Leeds in the Cham­pi­onship be­ing no ex­cep­tion as he steered them to the ti­tle and pro­mo­tion to the English top flight last sea­son.</p>
    <p>For Bielsa, tak­ing the ini­tia­tive is a sacro­sanct prin­ci­ple and he has no time for teams who sit back in de­fence, or “spec­u­late” as he dis­parag­ingly de­scribes it.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Argentina coach’s in­flu­ence is wide­spread, with Manch­ester City’s Pep Guardi­ola and for­mer Tot­ten­ham man­ager Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino among those who re­gard him as their men­tor, even if the con­tents of his tro­phy cab­i­net are mod­est.</p>
    <p>Rather than big-name play­ers, Bielsa works bet­ter with those who are pre­pared to adapt them­selves to his heav­ily de­mand­ing style, mak­ing Leeds an ideal club for his Pre­mier League de­but.</p>
    <p>It will be the third of Europe’s top leagues to ex­pe­ri­ence his sys­tem af­ter t he Span­ish La Liga and France’s Ligue One.</p>
    <p>While ini­tial pos­i­tive cam­paigns at Ath­letic Bil­bao and Mar­seille fiz­zled out, lead­ing to his de­par­ture, Bielsa ap­pears set­tled at El­land Road un­like his past clubs and even­tual win­ners Arse­nal ex­pe­ri­enced a fore­taste of what is to come dur­ing a 1-0 win over Leeds in the FA Cup third round last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“They are a night­mare for any</p>
    <p>team to play against,” said Gun­ners man­ager Mikel Arteta. “It is like go­ing to the den­tist... if you are not ready, you get ex­posed.”</p>
    <p>It is far re­moved from the 1960s and ’70s when their per­ceived winat-all-costs ap­proach un­der Don Re­vie earned them the “Dirty Leeds” nick­name as they swept up tro­phies in­clud­ing the league ti­tle, FA</p>
    <p>Cup and League Cup.</p>
    <p>But even if that la­bel no longer ap­plies on the pitch, they still quite like the con­cept.</p>
    <p>“We ac­tu­ally chan­nel that,” club chair­man An­drea Radriz­zani told Fifa mag­a­zine. “We want to play great foot­ball and we are do­ing that but we also need to fight every time we go onto the pitch... hav­ing that char­ac­ter is im­por­tant to be­ing a Leeds United player.”</p>
    <p>With that kind of bat­tling spirit plus the qual­ity of re­cent £30 mil­lion (S$53.3 mil­lion) club-record sign­ing Ro­drigo from Va­len­cia, the Whites can be ex­pected to scrap to en­sure their stay in the top flight will not be short-lived.</p>
    <p>The same, how­ever, can­not be said of the other two pro­moted clubs, Cham­pi­onship run­ners-up West Bromwich Al­bion and Ful­ham.</p>
    <p>Both are peren­nial yo-yo clubs, ex­pe­ri­enc­ing two rel­e­ga­tions each in the past 11 years. And with money tight and only a few un­known buys, the Cot­tagers and Bag­gies face a long and tough sea­son ahead.</p>
    <p>Teams who gain pro­mo­tion via the play-offs have a 61 per cent chance of go­ing straight back down but Ful­ham will be look­ing to their bright young man­ager Scott Parker to in­ject hope.</p>
    <p>“You can’t build teams with dras­tic changes, dras­tic swings of play­ers,” said the 39-year-old, Ful­ham’s care­taker boss when they were rel­e­gated from the top flight last year.</p>
    <p>“Some clear er­rors were made last time and we will learn from that.”</p>
