    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON Key bat­tle­ground states have been crit­i­cal in the United States pres­i­den­tial race.</p>
    <p>Here is where they stood yes­ter­day morn­ing (US time).</p>
    <p>WIS­CON­SIN</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den was de­clared the win­ner on Wed­nes­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Un­of­fi­cial counts showed he had 20,535 more votes than Mr Trump. The As­so­ci­ated Press, CNN and Fox News are among those that have called the state.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign plans to ex­er­cise its right to de­mand a re­count, as the un­of­fi­cial mar­gin of 0.7 per­cent­age point was within the 1 per cent that al­lows for such a move.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign man­ager Bill Stepien said in a state­ment that “there have been re­ports of ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties in sev­eral Wis­con­sin coun­ties which raise se­ri­ous doubts about the va­lid­ity of the re­sults”.</p>
    <p>He also charged that pub­lic polling had been used as a “voter sup­pres­sion” tac­tic.</p>
    <p>Once Mr Trump’s cam­paign for­mally calls for a re­count, it may take sev­eral days to process. In a re­count of the 2016 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, coun­ties com­pleted the process within 10 days.</p>
    <p>NE­VADA</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has only a nar­row lead, but here again it is hard to see where Mr Trump is sup­posed to make up ground.</p>
    <p>All of the elec­tion day vote has been counted, and now only Demo­cratic-lean­ing late mail and pro­vi­sional bal­lots re­main.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has re­tained a nar­row lead of fewer than 8,000 votes as bal­lots con­tinue to be counted. With tens of thou­sands of votes out­stand­ing, the fi­nal tally may not be im­mi­nent.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign has a pend­ing law­suit chal­leng­ing the ac­cu­racy of the state’s sig­na­ture­match­ing tech­nol­ogy and pub­lic ac­cess for elec­tion ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Ne­vada’s high­est court re­jected a re­quest to halt the bal­lot count­ing, say­ing that the state GOP failed to pro­duce ev­i­dence of wrong­do­ing. But the law­suit re­mains pend­ing.</p>
    <p>The state al­lows mail-in bal­lots that were post­marked as late as elec­tion day, and re­ceived by as late as next Tues­day, draw­ing out the po­ten­tial time­line.</p>
    <p>It also al­lows bal­lots with er­rors to be “cured” as late as Nov 12 and cer­ti­fied as late as Nov 16.</p>
    <p>With Mr Bi­den lead­ing and mail-in bal­lots ex­pected to skew Demo­cratic, prospects look promis­ing for him. Yet with a nar­row mar­gin and an es­ti­mated tens of thou­sands of mail-in bal­lots, the tim­ing of a fi­nal count re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>ARI­ZONA</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is at a much larger 5-point deficit in Ari­zona, so it may be sur­pris­ing to learn that it is still up for grabs.</p>
    <p>But there is un­cer­tainty about the re­main­ing vote. There are late mail bal­lots, re­ceived by the state over the last few days. These bal­lots usu­ally tilt Demo­cratic, but this year they might not.</p>
    <p>So many Democrats rushed their bal­lots in early that most of the re­main­ing ab­sen­tee bal­lots are from reg­is­tered Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble these Repub­li­cans just went out and voted on elec­tion day. But it is also pos­si­ble they have sent in their bal­lots, which have not been counted yet.</p>
    <p>MICHI­GAN</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had the lead here ini­tially, but it had evap­o­rated by Wed­nes­day night.</p>
    <p>The lead dwin­dled on Wed­nes­day morn­ing, and Mr Bi­den over­took him, with many votes re­main­ing to be counted in heav­ily Demo­cratic Wayne County.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den led the state by about more than 120,000 votes – or about 2.2 per­cent­age points – as of 10.30pm on Wed­nes­day with about 94 per cent of bal­lots counted.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign said be­fore the net­works pro­jected Mr Bi­den to win Michi­gan that it was su­ing to stop vote counts in the state – claim­ing its rep­re­sen­ta­tives have not been given mean­ing­ful ac­cess to count­ing lo­ca­tions to ob­serve the process.</p>
    <p>It is rea­son­able to as­sume that a lot of the out­stand­ing vote is Demo­cratic mail ab­sen­tee, which poll work­ers were not al­lowed to be­gin pro­cess­ing un­til ei­ther Mon­day or Tues­day.</p>
    <p>PENN­SYL­VA­NIA</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Trump’s lead in Penn­syl­va­nia had plum­meted to two per­cent­age points as of yes­ter­day</p>
    <p>morn­ing US east­ern time, as the mail ab­sen­tee bal­lot count pro­ceeded briskly across the state.</p>
    <p>There is ev­ery in­di­ca­tion that Mr Bi­den re­mains on track to pull ahead when all of the votes are in and counted.</p>
    <p>So far, Mr Bi­den has been win­ning ab­sen­tee votes, 77 per cent to 22 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the Penn­syl­va­nia sec­re­tary of state. At that pace, he needs only 288,000 more mail votes be­fore tak­ing the lead. There are an es­ti­mated 500,000 mail bal­lots left.</p>
    <p>“The over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of bal­lots will be counted by Fri­day, and at this point it looks like sig­nif­i­cantly sooner than that,” Ms Kathy Boock­var, the sec­re­tary of the Com­mon­wealth of Penn­syl­va­nia, said on CNN.</p>
    <p>GE­OR­GIA</p>
    <p>By yes­ter­day morn­ing US time, Mr Trump was lead­ing by four-tenths of a per­cent­age point – just un­der 19,000 votes – af­ter heav­ily Demo­cratic bal­lots in the At­lanta area were fi­nally counted. There are still more ab­sen­tee bal­lots left for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>It is not clear how many bal­lots there are, and where. Yes­ter­day morn­ing, the Ge­or­gia sec­re­tary of state ini­tially said there were 25,000 bal­lots re­main­ing. If so, Mr Bi­den’s push might fall just short of vic­tory, though he would still have a chance with pro­vi­sional bal­lots. Then, later in the morn­ing, the sec­re­tary of state said it was 50,000 bal­lots.</p>
    <p>An­other of­fi­cial said there were 61,367 re­main­ing bal­lots. That</p>
    <p>would be enough for Mr Bi­den to be a favourite.</p>
    <p>NORTH CAROLINA</p>
    <p>This is the one state where Mr Trump is the favourite.</p>
    <p>The race is not par­tic­u­larly close, but there is a big miss­ing piece of the puz­zle: late mail bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump led Mr Bi­den by about 77,000 votes as of 10.30pm east­ern time on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to the AP.</p>
    <p>The state still has yet to count about 117,000 ab­sen­tee bal­lots, plus an un­known num­ber of pro­vi­sional bal­lots, out­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>Ab­sen­tee bal­lots can be counted up to Thurs­day next week, as long as they were post­marked by elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>No ma­jor law­suits have yet been</p>
    <p>filed in North Carolina, but pro­vi­sional bal­lots could be an area where ten­sion erupts.</p>
    <p>The state was plan­ning to re­lease num­bers on pro­vi­sional bal­lots by mid­day yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Coun­ties have sched­uled meet­ings for next Thurs­day and Fri­day to tally the re­sults from their out­stand­ing ab­sen­tee and pro­vi­sional bal­lots af­ter they con­duct au­dits and other pro­ce­dural checks. Due to pub­lic no­tice re­quire­ments un­der state law, those meet­ings can­not be moved ear­lier. The state Board of Elec­tions will pro­vide a fi­nal and of­fi­cial count that will be cer­ti­fied at a Nov 24 meet­ing.</p>
    <p>It could take a week to get the fi­nal re­sults, but Mr Trump ap­pears to be more likely to win the state.</p>
