    <p>LAS VE­GAS • The Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) is set to cut 60 mixed mar­tial arts ex­po­nents from its ros­ter be­fore the end of the year, pres­i­dent Dana White told a me­dia con­fer­ence af­ter Satur­day’s card in Las Ve­gas.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion about Cuban mid­dleweight Yoel Romero, who was re­cently dropped by the or­gan­i­sa­tion de­spite fight­ing for a ti­tle as re­cently as last March. The UFC cur­rently lists 724 ac­tive fight­ers on its web­site (ufc.com), com­pris­ing 117 women and 607 men.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to go through some se­ri­ous cuts here at the end of the year, prob­a­bly go­ing to have 60 cuts here be­fore the end of the year... our ros­ter is very in­flated right now,” White told reporters.</p>
    <p>“We’re just lit­er­ally start­ing to go through the list and he (Romero) is 44, he’s lost four of his last five. Th­ese are the tough de­ci­sions you’ve got to make.”</p>
    <p>The UFC was one of the first ma­jor Amer­i­can sports bod­ies to restart in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic, cre­at­ing a bub­ble and stag­ing cards in Florida and Las Ve­gas as well as “Fight Is­land” in Abu Dhabi, with no fans in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>De­spite the dif­fi­cul­ties and the up­com­ing cuts, White de­clared him­self happy with the way 2020 has panned out, say­ing: “For all the neg­a­tive things and bad stuff that has hap­pened this year, it sure has played out pretty well for us.”</p>
