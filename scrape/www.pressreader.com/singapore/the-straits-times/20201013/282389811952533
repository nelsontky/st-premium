    <p>Ji­wang is Malay slang for ex­ces­sive ro­man­tic, an­guish and heart­break­ing love and also refers to a pe­riod in the 1980s to1990s when the genre of Malay lan­guage slow rock mu­sic cat­a­pulted to pop­u­lar­ity in Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>In this karaoke dance film, view­ers were greeted first by Norhaizad Adam, who is also the di­rec­tor, per­form­ing to a slow-rock clas­sic, Si­apa Di Ha­timu (Who Is In Your Heart) by the band Eka­ma­tra.</p>
    <p>With his shades on, he moved spo­rad­i­cally to the song, at times em­body­ing the cliched man­ner­isms of love-lorn singers.</p>
    <p>He set the tone for the next three so­los per­formed by Sy­imah Sabtu, Koh Xiao Jun and Sharul Mohd, whose in­ter­pre­ta­tions of dif­fer­ent Ji­wang songs through move­ments and the use of props con­jured up ex­pe­ri­ences that re­flected the vary­ing moods and char­ac­ter­is­tics of the genre.</p>
    <p>I was most i ntrigued by two el­e­ments of the work which, al­though dis­con­cert­ing, were quite clever.</p>
    <p>The first was the in­cor­po­ra­tion of karaoke aes­thet­ics. From the atyp­i­cal lyrics on screen that changed colour con­cur­rently as the words were sung to the scrolling of song ti­tles dur­ing i nter­ludes and the awk­ward video ed­its, these char­ac­ter­is­tics of medi­ocre karaoke videos added to the view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The aes­thet­ics at times took view­ers away from the danc­ing per­former, but an interactiv­e fea­ture in­tro­duced later made for a wel­come dis­rup­tion to the hyp­no­tism.</p>
    <p>Mid-way through the duet, view­ers had to choose which of the two per­form­ers should leave the space.</p>
    <p>Best ex­pe­ri­enced when one belts out the songs, Ji­wang was an in­no­va­tive at­tempt to make sense of the grad­ual artis­tic mi­gra­tion to dig­i­tal and tap the re­cent past to re­flect the un­cer­tain­ties of the present.</p>
