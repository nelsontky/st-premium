    <p>Me­di­a­corp artistes are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for pos­si­ble breaches of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures af­ter a group gath­ered at a res­i­dence to cel­e­brate ac­tor Jef­frey Xu’s birth­day.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) con­firmed the probe, say­ing it was alerted to the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing in re­spect of pos­si­ble breaches by the var­i­ous par­ties,” a spokesman said, with­out iden­ti­fy­ing the in­di­vid­u­als im­pli­cated.</p>
    <p>“MND and other gov­ern­ment agen­cies take a se­ri­ous view of such breaches and will not hes­i­tate to take firm ac­tion against those who are found to have vi­o­lated safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Me­di­a­corp celebri­ties Xu, Shane Pow and Ter­ence Cao apol­o­gised on Wed­nes­day via the broad­caster af­ter photos of them ap­par­ently breach­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions were posted on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>One pic­ture, re­port­edly up­loaded on Oct 3, showed 13 peo­ple stand­ing close to one another, with Xu hold­ing a cake.</p>
    <p>No one was wear­ing a mask. Un­der cur­rent Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions, so­cial gath­er­ings must be lim­ited to groups of five out­side res­i­dences. House­holds may re­ceive up to five vis­i­tors at any one time.</p>
    <p>From Mon­day, so­cial gath­er­ings in groups of eight will be al­lowed out­side the home, and house­holds may re­ceive up to eight vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>A Shin Min Daily News reader had tipped off the Chi­ne­se­lan­guage pub­li­ca­tion – which ran a re­port on Wed­nes­day – that Xu, who cel­e­brated his 32nd birth­day on Oct 3, had posted an In­sta­gram story of a large gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The at­ten­dees in­cluded other celebri­ties such as Jeremy Chan and Julie Tan, who are not man­aged by Me­di­a­corp.</p>
    <p>Me­di­a­corp said in a state­ment to Shin Min that the three stars un­der its man­age­ment – Xu, Cao and Pow – con­firmed that they were at the gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>It said the three “deeply re­gret” their ac­tions and apol­o­gised for their mis­takes.</p>
    <p>In an up­dated state­ment, Me­di­a­corp said that 987FM dee­jay So­nia Chew was also at the gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The broad­caster said that it takes safe dis­tanc­ing and Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions se­ri­ously, and re­minded its artistes to fol­low such rules in both their pro­fes­sional and per­sonal ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Tan, who is man­aged by LNX Global, ac­tor Li Nanx­ing’s man­age­ment agency, also is­sued an apol­ogy in a state­ment to The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>She wrote: “I have made a mis­take. I recog­nise the self­ish­ness of my ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery cit­i­zen has a duty, ev­ery per­son has re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. As a pub­lic fig­ure, I was sup­posed to be a good role model, but I have failed.”</p>
