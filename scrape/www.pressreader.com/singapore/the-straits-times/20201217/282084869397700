    <p>The eco­nomic down­turn wrought by the pan­demic has not de­terred busi­ness­man Mo­hamed Ab­dul Jaleel from pledg­ing $500,000 to sup­port stu­dents from needy Sin­ga­porean fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Jaleel, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Mini En­vi­ron­ment Ser­vice Group, told The Straits Times: “Whether it’s a good or bad time, ed­u­ca­tion is an im­por­tant area. Stu­dents’ tuck-shop money is equally im­por­tant, so I think they should not be left out of the priv­i­lege re­gard­less what the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion is.</p>
    <p>“I hope the stu­dents re­alise there are peo­ple who have helped them dur­ing the bad days and that they will one day in turn con­trib­ute back to so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jaleel pre­sented The Straits</p>
    <p>Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF) with a $500,000 cheque yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal amount do­nated by him since 2010 to $4.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The fund was started on Chil­dren’s Day on Oct 1, 2000 and has dis­bursed more than $80 mil­lion since, help­ing around 180,000 stu­dents from fam­i­lies whose per capita gross monthly house­hold in­come does not ex­ceed $690.</p>
    <p>Close to $11 mil­lion will be given out this year to about 10,000 ben­e­fi­cia­ries – from pri­mary school pupils to stu­dents in the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion, ju­nior col­leges and poly­tech­nics.</p>
    <p>The amount is higher than usual as this year has seen far larger out­lays given the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the fund rolled out a spe­cial $100 pay­out in Oc­to­ber to help about 10,000 stu­dents cope dur­ing the down­turn.</p>
    <p>About 2,000 stu­dents have also been se­lected by schools and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies for a $500 e-grant to buy prod­ucts from Chal­lenger or Har­vey Nor­man to help them with home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>STSPMF chair­man War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is also Straits Times ed­i­tor and ed­i­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group, said: “Given the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion and job cuts, we’ve seen a surge in the num­bers of peo­ple com­ing to us.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to try our best to help as many peo­ple as we pos­si­bly could, by even dip­ping into our re­serves. The more we’ve stepped up to help, the more donors have come for­ward to con­trib­ute. That re­as­sured us that Sin­ga­pore­ans saw what we were do­ing was im­por­tant and mak­ing a good con­tri­bu­tion to those in need.”</p>
