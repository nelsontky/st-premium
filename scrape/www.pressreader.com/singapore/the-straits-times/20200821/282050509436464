    <p>Mr Ngiam Tong Dow, son of a court in­ter­preter and a wash­er­woman from Hainan who rose to be a top civil ser­vant and later an out­spo­ken critic of the pub­lic ser­vice and the Gov­ern­ment, died yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>He was 83.</p>
    <p>His fam­ily told The Straits Times that he had been in ill health for 41/</p>
    <p>2 years.</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam spent 40 years in the apex Ad­min­is­tra­tive Ser­vice de­vel­op­ing poli­cies on the econ­omy, de­fence tech­nol­ogy, trans­port, sav­ings and re­tire­ment, as well as hous­ing.</p>
    <p>He worked closely with found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew and his suc­ces­sor Goh Chok Tong, as well as for­mer deputy prime min­is­ter Goh Keng Swee.</p>
    <p>He was also chair­man of the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB), DBS Bank, Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Board and the Hous­ing Board.</p>
    <p>But it was a twist of fate that put him on the road to suc­cess in pub­lic ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis – a disease that killed his fa­ther when the younger Ngiam was just a nine-year-old – scut­tled his am­bi­tion to be a postal clerk. A pre-em­ploy­ment med­i­cal check-up showed he had con­tracted early-stage tu­ber­cu­lo­sis.</p>
    <p>After he was de­clared un­fit for work, he went back to his books and won an open bur­sary to the Univer­sity of Malaya, where he got first-class honours in eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>He joined the Ad­min­is­tra­tive Ser­vice in Au­gust 1959.</p>
    <p>Few could tell the story of Sin­ga­pore’s trans­for­ma­tion from Third World to First as he could – from the days of high un­em­ploy­ment, squat­ters and tin-shed fac­to­ries when he be­gan work­ing life, to a high-tech econ­omy with a First World per capita in­come when his ca­reer came to a close.</p>
    <p>He be­came the youngest per­ma­nent sec­re­tary at age 35, and made the rounds in key min­istries such as Fi­nance, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, and Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Sharp and forth­right, he quickly de­vel­oped a rep­u­ta­tion for hav­ing iron in his spine.</p>
    <p>For­mer Cab­i­net min­is­ter S. Dhan­a­balan said Mr Ngiam was his first choice for per­ma­nent sec­re­tary when he was given the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment port­fo­lio in 1987.</p>
    <p>The min­istry was un­der­go­ing a “ma­jor shake-up” then, he added.</p>
    <p>Many of the older civil ser­vants will re­call the need to bring forth ro­bust ar­gu­ments to sup­port their fund­ing re­quests to the Min­istry of Fi­nance when he was the per­ma­nent sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>He would go to his favourite cof­fee shop along Telok Ayer Street and share a ta­ble with the lunchtime crowd to have his favourite Teochew por­ridge.</p>
    <p>Its pre­vi­ous min­is­ter, Teh Cheang Wan, had been in­ves­ti­gated for cor­rup­tion and com­mit­ted sui­cide a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“Then Prime Min­is­ter (Lee Kuan Yew) said I could have a choice of any­body to be the per­ma­nent sec­re­tary. I asked for Ngiam Tong Dow, who was known to be an­a­lyt­i­cal and pre­pared to speak his mind,” said Mr Dhan­a­balan, 83, who joined the EDB with Mr Ngiam when it was set up in 1961.</p>
    <p>For­mer head of civil ser­vice and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore chair­man Peter Ong said Mr Ngiam’s in­flu­ence on the civil ser­vice was “leg­endary”. “Many of the older civil ser­vants will re­call the need to bring forth ro­bust ar­gu­ments to sup­port their fund­ing re­quests to the Min­istry of Fi­nance when he was the per­ma­nent sec­re­tary.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam held the post for 13 years un­til he re­tired in 1999.</p>
    <p>He sub­se­quently joined the boards of com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Te­masek and Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>DBS chair­man Peter Seah said Mr Ngiam was in­stru­men­tal in boost­ing the bank’s sup­port for home­grown com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The man en­joyed a sim­ple and fru­gal life­style, he said. “He would go to his favourite cof­fee shop along Telok Ayer Street and share a ta­ble with the lunchtime crowd to have his favourite Teochew por­ridge.”</p>
    <p>Even after his re­tire­ment, af­fairs of state con­tin­ued to weigh on his mind. He of­ten spoke about his wor­ries for the fu­ture of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times in 2003, he said Sin­ga­pore is “larger than the PAP”, and tal­ent should be al­lowed to spread through­out so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“So far, the PAP’s tac­tic is to put all the schol­ars into the civil ser­vice... But in my view, that’s a very short-term view,” he said.</p>
    <p>He cred­ited the EDB for his hands-on ap­proach to pub­lic ser­vice. “In­vest­ment pro­mo­tion then was all about hard foot slog­ging and per­sonal per­sua­sion, which teaches you to be very hum­ble and pa­tient,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I learnt to be a sup­pli­cant and a pro­fes­sional beg­gar, in­stead of a dis­penser of favours.”</p>
    <p>He also pushed for more gov­ern­ment sup­port to grow lo­cal small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, in­stead of over-re­ly­ing on for­eign multi­na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>This, he be­lieved, was the way to en­sure that knowl­edge would be rooted in Sin­ga­pore­ans and based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, it was not the dol­lars and cents, but the com­pas­sion­ate side of pol­i­cy­mak­ing, that mat­tered to him.</p>
    <p>In 2010, he said in a Busi­ness Times in­ter­view: “We should be a hu­mane so­ci­ety where peo­ple have re­spect for each other. Then we can sur­vive. That’s the Sin­ga­pore I would want for my grand­chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ngiam is sur­vived by his wife Jeanette Gan Choon Neo, daugh­ter Selina, son Kelvin, and three grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The wake will be held at 4 Ch­est­nut Av­enue be­tween noon and 10pm to­day and to­mor­row, with a prayer ser­vice at 8pm. The cortege will leave for Mandai Cre­ma­to­rium on Sun­day for a pri­vate ser­vice.</p>
