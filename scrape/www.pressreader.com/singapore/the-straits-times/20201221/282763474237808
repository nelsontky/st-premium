    <p>Gourmet food for dogs is not un­heard of. Pet cafes do of­fer fancy dishes such as grilled sir­loin steak and salmon bento sets.</p>
    <p>But dog food touted to be as palat­able to hu­mans as ca­nines?</p>
    <p>Pre­mium dog food man­u­fac­turer Furry’s Kitchen de­cided to put its prod­ucts to the test by team­ing up with chef Justin Quek to come up with a de­gus­ta­tion meal at a popup restau­rant called Ter­rier By Justin Quek.</p>
    <p>Food in­flu­encers were in­vited for the meal on March 20, with­out know­ing be­fore­hand it was made with Furry’s Kitchen prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>In a video re­leased on Dec 8 – pro­duc­tion was de­layed due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – the in­flu­encers praised the flavour of the food and said it tasted “com­fort­ing”. One liked the vel­vety tex­ture and said it re­minded her of what her grand­mother cooked for her when she was young.</p>
    <p>Furry’s Kitchen founder Stephen Chua said the pop-up aims to chal­lenge the per­cep­tion that food for dogs tastes un­pleas­ant and is made with in­dis­cernible in­gre­di­ents and preser­va­tives un­fit for hu­man con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>For its prod­ucts, Furry’s Kitchen uses hu­man-grade in­gre­di­ents such as beef, salmon and veg­eta­bles from food sup­pli­ers which sup­ply to restau­rants here. Steam­ing is the only cook­ing method used so as to keep the meals healthy.</p>
    <p>While Furry’s Kitchen sells its prod­ucts on­line, the pop-up restau­rant meal is not avail­able.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times put the same menu to the test with The New Pa­per food colum­nist Yeoh Wee Teck, his French bull­dog Ru­fus and me tast­ing the food.</p>
    <p>For the meal, chef Quek used four prod­ucts such as lamb and pump­kin, salmon and pasta, chicken and brown rice and pork and broc­coli, which he jazzed up with other in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>Ru­fus was served two cour­ses while the hu­mans had four.</p>
    <p>Apart from the larger por­tions and salt used to sea­son the dishes for the hu­mans, there was no dif­fer­ence in in­gre­di­ents used nor in the meth­ods of prepa­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The meal kicked off with a canape of Lamb And Cumin On Toast served only to the hu­mans. Gar­nished with minced herbs, the canapes looked like those served at restau­rants and cock­tail re­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>I found the minced lamb to be fine in tex­ture and so well-sea­soned with cumin that it did not have meaty odours.</p>
    <p>But Mr Yeoh pre­ferred his lamb whole and with “more of that sig­na­ture flavour in the meat”.</p>
    <p>Next was the starter of Salmon Sphere With Dill & Cu­cum­ber Geele Con­somme With A Crispy Car­rot Salad, which was served to both hu­mans and dog.</p>
    <p>The pre­sen­ta­tion was vis­ually in­ter­est­ing. Chef Quek added gelatin to strained cu­cum­ber and dill juice and placed it in a mould. A piece of lace tu­ile made from car­rot added an el­e­gant touch.</p>
    <p>He added microgreen­s, chopped egg, chopped dill and chives to the salmon and pasta from Furry’s Kitchen.</p>
    <p>The ef­fect was pleas­ing to Mr Yeoh, who found the dill geele re­fresh­ing and said it en­hanced the fish.</p>
    <p>But af­ter tak­ing a bite from Ru­fus’ plate, he pre­ferred the un­sea­soned ver­sion. He said: “The bland­ness of the salmon worked be­cause it makes you ap­pre­ci­ate the sub­tle sweet­ness of the fish.”</p>
    <p>Ru­fus lapped up the dish with much en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh said: “Ru­fus is al­ways hun­gry, so he may not be the most dis­cern­ing critic. He paused a lit­tle when con­fronted with the dill geele be­cause that’s new. But once he got a whiff of the salmon be­neath, it was his­tory. I can safely say it’s a 10 out of 10 from him.”</p>
    <p>I found the dish to be the best out of the en­tire meal. It was light­tast­ing and the microgreen­s added crisp­ness to the minced salmon.</p>
    <p>But Soup Of Chicken & Brown</p>
    <p>Rice Veloute With Fresh Herbs did not im­press the hu­man judges. Ru­fus did not get this dish as the veloute was al­ready sea­soned.</p>
    <p>For this dish, chef Quek per­son­ally served the veloute, pool­ing it around the plated chicken and brown rice quenelles.</p>
    <p>But Mr Yeoh said: “It felt al­most home­made, which would not be the ex­pe­ri­ence I’m look­ing for if I’m in a celebrity chef restau­rant.”</p>
    <p>The veloute was flavour­some, but the quenelles did taste homely and sim­i­lar to what I usu­ally cook for my dog.</p>
    <p>The main course of Oven-baked Minced Pork With Herbs & Veg­etable Mille-Feuille, Bal­samic & Yel­low Cap­sicum Coulis was a hit with both Mr Yeoh and Ru­fus.</p>
    <p>Chopped gar­lic and rose­mary were added to the pork and broc­coli from Furry’s Kitchen. Ru­fus fin­ished his por­tion in a hurry and pro­ceeded to eye our plates.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh said: “This was my favourite of the lot be­cause it was packed with flavours, al­most as if the chef was mak­ing up for not adding sea­son­ing to the dog ver­sion.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, I dif­fered in opin­ion. While the minced meat was clev­erly dis­guised un­der lay­ered pan-fried zuc­chini, the pre­sen­ta­tion did not mask the over­whelm­ing meaty odour of the pork.</p>
    <p>Chef Quek, who owns the fine­din­ing Chi­nois­erie and more ca­sual JustIN at Ma­rina Bay Sands, was scep­ti­cal when he was first ap­proached to cre­ate the meal us­ing prod­ucts from Furry’s Kitchen.</p>
    <p>But he tasted them and found that they were made from nat­u­ral in­gre­di­ents. He said: “It is the pack­ag­ing that poses a psy­cho­log­i­cal bar­rier to peo­ple see­ing dog food as hu­man-grade. I took it as a chal­lenge to make the minced food look pretty.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh, who feeds Ru­fus a diet of home-cooked food such as minced pork and a va­ri­ety of fruit and veg­eta­bles as ad­vised by a vet, is not likely to buy Furry’s Kitchen prod­ucts un­less it is more eco­nom­i­cal.</p>
    <p>As for me, my dog also eats home-cooked food and I think Furry’s Kitchen could be a vi­able al­ter­na­tive for dog own­ers with no time to cook for their pets.</p>
    <p>The idea of serv­ing dog food to hu­mans is gim­micky, but it helps to re­mind peo­ple that dogs do not al­ways have to be fed a pro­cessed diet of kib­bles or canned food.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, furkids, who have a much shorter life­span than hu­mans, do de­serve a diet of healthy and nu­tri­tious hu­man-grade food.</p>
