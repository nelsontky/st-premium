    <p>WASHINGTON • Elec­tion of­fi­cials in dozens of states rep­re­sent­ing both po­lit­i­cal par­ties said that there was no ev­i­dence that fraud or other ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties played a role in the out­come of the pres­i­den­tial race, amount­ing to a force­ful re­buke of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s por­trait of a fraud­u­lent elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Over the past sev­eral days, the Pres­i­dent, mem­bers of his ad­min­is­tra­tion, con­gres­sional Repub­li­cans and right-wing al­lies have put forth the false claim that the elec­tion was stolen from Mr Trump and have re­fused to ac­cept re­sults that showed Mr Joe Bi­den as the winner.</p>
    <p>But top elec­tion of­fi­cials across the coun­try said in in­ter­views and state­ments that the process had been a re­mark­able success de­spite record turnout and the com­pli­ca­tions of a dan­ger­ous pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“There’s a great hu­man ca­pac­ity for in­vent­ing things that aren’t true about elec­tions,” said Mr Frank LaRose, a Repub­li­can who serves as Ohio’s Sec­re­tary of State.</p>
    <p>“The con­spir­acy the­o­ries and ru­mours and all those things run ram­pant. For some rea­son, elec­tions breed that type of mythol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>Mr Steve Si­mon, a Demo­crat who is Min­nesota’s Sec­re­tary of State, said: “I don’t know of a sin­gle case where some­one ar­gued that a vote counted when it shouldn’t have or didn’t count when it should.</p>
    <p>“There was no fraud.” A spokesman for Mr Scott Sch­wab, the Repub­li­can Sec­re­tary of State in Kansas, said in an e-mail on Tues­day: “Kansas did not ex­pe­ri­ence any wide­spread, sys­tem­atic is­sues with voter fraud, in­tim­i­da­tion, ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties or vot­ing prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“We are very pleased with how the elec­tion has gone up to this point.”</p>
    <p>The New York Times con­tacted the of­fices of the top elec­tion offi</p>
    <p>US$1m A S$1.35 mil­lion fund to re­ward re­ports of voter fraud was an­nounced by the Repub­li­can Lieu­tenant-Gov­er­nor in Texas, Mr Dan Pa­trick, on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>cials in ev­ery state on Mon­day and Tues­day to ask whether they sus­pected or had ev­i­dence of il­le­gal vot­ing. Of­fi­cials in 45 states re­sponded di­rectly to The Times.</p>
    <p>For four of the re­main­ing states, The Times spoke to other statewide of­fi­cials or found public com­ments from sec­re­taries of state. None re­ported any ma­jor vot­ing is­sues.</p>
    <p>Statewide of­fi­cials in Texas did not re­spond to re­peated in­quiries.</p>
    <p>But a spokesman for the top elec­tions of­fi­cial in Har­ris County, the largest county in Texas with a pop­u­la­tion greater than many states, said that there were only a few mi­nor is­sues and that “we had a very seam­less elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the Repub­li­can Lieu­tenant-Gov­er­nor in Texas, Mr Dan Pa­trick, an­nounced a US$1 mil­lion (S$1.35 mil­lion) fund to re­ward re­ports of voter fraud.</p>
    <p>Some states de­scribed small prob­lems com­mon to all elec­tions, which they said they were ad­dress­ing – a few in­stances of il­le­gal or dou­ble vot­ing, some tech­ni­cal glitches and some mi­nor er­rors in maths.</p>
