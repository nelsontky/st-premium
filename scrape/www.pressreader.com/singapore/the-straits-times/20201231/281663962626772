    <p>To stay ahead of the com­pe­ti­tion in the next stage of its eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, Sin­ga­pore has two crit­i­cal tasks at hand, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One, it has to rally peo­ple to ac­tion by be­ing up­front about the chal­lenges, con­tin­u­ously guard­ing against com­pla­cency, and de­vel­op­ing a na­tion of peo­ple and busi­nesses who are not afraid of global com­pe­ti­tion but seek to thrive in it.</p>
    <p>“We must as­sume that we can eas­ily be over­taken by oth­ers who are hun­grier, and who can leapfrog us,” he said, not­ing this has hap­pened to some ar­eas in in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, fi­nance and ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>“We will not just play de­fen­sive to try to get back to where we were. In­stead, we are con­stantly chal­leng­ing our­selves to come up with new ideas and value propo­si­tions to cap­ture new mar­kets ahead of oth­ers amidst the pan­demic,” he said of the Covid-19 eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Two, it must man­age the longterm chal­lenge of wage dis­par­ity by equip­ping peo­ple with skills for the fu­ture, en­abling them to com­pete glob­ally, and hav­ing a col­lec­tive so­cial con­science where those who have suc­ceeded help those who have not.</p>
    <p>“We must take tan­gi­ble and sus­tained ac­tions to level up our peo­ple and com­pa­nies for the long term, rather than just re­sort­ing to pop­ulist ac­tions like else­where to ei­ther shut out for­eign com­pe­ti­tion, or con­duct un­sus­tain­able re­dis­tri­bu­tion of a shrink­ing pie,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The real com­pe­ti­tion is not amongst the lo­cal and for­eign work­ers or com­pa­nies here. The real com­pe­ti­tion for our five mil­lion peo­ple is with the seven bil­lion peo­ple out­side Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan was speak­ing at the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) So­ci­ety’s 30th an­niver­sary com­mem­o­ra­tion event, held in a hy­brid for­mat at the Capi­tol Kempin­ski Ho­tel ahead of a closed-door dia­logue with the so­ci­ety’s alumni.</p>
    <p>In his speech, he out­lined how the EDB has been a key driver of Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. It se­cured $13 bil­lion of fixed as­set in­vest­ment com­mit­ments in the first four months of this year, de­spite the pan­demic. In com­par­i­son, it at­tracted $15.2 bil­lion of com­mit­ments for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>He also touched on three global trends and how Sin­ga­pore planned to re­spond to them.</p>
    <p>First, while shifts in global sup­ply chains have ac­cel­er­ated through the Covid-19 cri­sis, they present op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore, he said, not­ing that the abil­ity to cre­ate trusted en­vi­ron­ments and sys­tems to at­tract cap­i­tal and tal­ent, as well as gen­er­ate and pro­tect in­tel­lec­tual cap­i­tal, are ar­eas the coun­try can cap­ture.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, growth dis­par­ity across economies, as well as in cor­po­rate earn­ings and wages, is also likely to con­tinue widen­ing, Mr Chan said. But economies and com­pa­nies which can adapt to tech­no­log­i­cal trends and global shifts will ex­cel, as will work­ers with the right skills and in the right com­pa­nies and in­dus­tries, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not im­mune from such in­equal­ity, he said, adding that govern­ments have to muster the po­lit­i­cal will and re­sources to dis­trib­ute the fruits of trade, and help busi­nesses and peo­ple ad­just to new re­al­i­ties and em­brace new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Third, ma­jor pow­ers such as China, the Euro­pean Union and the United States are likely to be more wary in shoul­der­ing global re­spon­si­bil­i­ties for greater in­te­gra­tion, given their own do­mes­tic chal­lenges, and other coun­tries may need to step up to re­in­force the rules-based sys­tem by which the world op­er­ates.</p>
    <p>“The re­spon­si­bil­ity to up­hold and up­date the global trad­ing sys</p>
    <p>tem can­not be the sole pre­rog­a­tive and re­spon­si­bil­ity of the two ma­jor pow­ers alone,” he said, adding that Sin­ga­pore can­not af­ford to be pas­sive given the se­vere reper­cus­sions of a re­treat from mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>“We must work with like-minded part­ners to stand as an in­te­gra­tive force, deep­en­ing coun­try-to-coun­try link­ages, and set high-stan­dard global rules with part­ners to en­able busi­nesses to thrive,” he added, not­ing Sin­ga­pore’s role in re­gional co­op­er­a­tion and its ef­forts to en­gage both China and the US and keep them in­vested in this re­gion.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter added that Covid-19 may be the cri­sis of a century, but he is con­fi­dent that Sin­ga­pore is well placed to emerge stronger</p>
    <p>from it. “Not only that, if we do things right, we can also turn this into the op­por­tu­nity of a gen­er­a­tion, for us to pull apart from the com­pe­ti­tion and dis­tin­guish our­selves as a na­tion (with) how we take care of one an­other through thick and thin,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Dis­tin­guished Fel­low of the EDB So­ci­ety award was con­ferred on two for­mer chair­men of the EDB – Mr Teo Ming Kian and Mr Lim Siong Guan. Mr Teo was chair­man from 2001 to 2006, and Mr Lim from 2006 to 2009. For­mer re­cip­i­ents of the award in­clude Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and late pres­i­dent S R Nathan.</p>
