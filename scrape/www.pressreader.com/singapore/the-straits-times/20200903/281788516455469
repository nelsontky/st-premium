    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia’s coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions rose to al­most 3.8 mil­lion yes­ter­day, as its states con­tin­ued to re­lax rules on move­ment de­spite the surge in cases.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 78,357 new cases in the past 24 hours, ac­cord­ing to fed­eral health data, tak­ing to­tal in­fec­tions to 3,769,523. Some 66,333 peo­ple have died. In­dia’s to­tal cases lag only the United States and Brazil, which it will over­take in days based on cur­rent trends.</p>
    <p>Prime Minister Naren­dra Modi or­dered a na­tion­wide lock­down in March when the coun­try was re­port­ing fewer than 100 daily cases, win­ning praise from some ex­perts for early ac­tion, but warn­ings from oth­ers the re­stric­tions had been im­posed too soon.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s econ­omy shrank by nearly a quar­ter in the April-June pe­riod, data showed on Mon­day, worse than fore­cast and plac­ing in­creas­ing pres­sure on pol­i­cy­mak­ers to kick-start growth, de­spite the high num­ber of new cases.</p>
    <p>The chief minister of Goa, a pop­u­lar tourist des­ti­na­tion that has re­cently re­laxed quar­an­tine rules to at­tract visi­tors, said yes­ter­day he had tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>“Those who have come in my close con­tact are ad­vised to take the necessary pre­cau­tions,” Mr Pramod Sawant, a mem­ber of Mr Modi’s rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party, said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in the cap­i­tal New Delhi were due to meet later yes­ter­day to dis­cuss the re­open­ing of the city’s metro, de­spite fresh cases there sit­ting at a two-month high.</p>
    <p>In­dia is con­sid­er­ing ex­tend­ing its flag­ship jobs pro­gramme in vil­lages to work­ers in cities left un­em­ployed by the virus-in­duced lock­downs, a gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, when ap­proved, may be rolled out in smaller cities and ini­tially cost about 350 bil­lion ru­pees (S$6.5 bil­lion), said Mr San­jay Ku­mar, a joint sec­re­tary in the Min­istry of Hous­ing and Ur­ban Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment has been con­sid­er­ing this idea since last year,” he said. “The pan­demic gave a push to this dis­cus­sion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Modi’s gov­ern­ment is al­ready spend­ing more than one tril­lion ru­pees on a ru­ral jobs pro­gramme this year, un­der which work­ers in the hin­ter­land can earn a guar­an­teed min­i­mum daily wage of 202 ru­pees for at least 100 days a year.</p>
    <p>An ur­ban ver­sion of the plan will soften the blow on cit­i­zens most af­fected by the coro­n­avirus fall­out, which has set Asia’s third-largest econ­omy on course for its deep­est con­trac­tion in his­tory. The idea is to start with smaller towns be­cause big-city projects typ­i­cally need pro­fes­sional ex­per­tise, Mr Ku­mar said.</p>
    <p>The ru­ral pro­gramme in­volves em­ploy­ing peo­ple for lo­cal pub­lic works projects such as road-build­ing, well-dig­ging and re­for­esta­tion.</p>
    <p>It now cov­ers over 270 mil­lion peo­ple and was used as a tool to pro­vide em­ploy­ment to mi­grant work­ers re­turn­ing from cities amid the lock­downs. That said, Covid-19 also dec­i­mated liveli­hoods in ur­ban In­dia, cre­at­ing a new un­der­class of work­ers who are be­ing pushed into poverty, ac­cord­ing to an anal­y­sis by the Lon­don School of Eco­nomics.</p>
