    <p>A 56-year-old woman who lives in a mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar prop­erty at Sen­tosa Cove is con­test­ing claims that she abused two do­mes­tic helpers at home.</p>
    <p>Tan Lee Hoon was in court yes­ter­day at the start of a trial in which she is fac­ing eight counts of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to the Filipino na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>Both maids were em­ployed by Tan’s hus­band Sim Guan Huat, 59, who is fac­ing charges in­volv­ing the il­le­gal em­ploy­ment of for­eign na­tion­als, in­clud­ing one of the maids – Ms Joan Lozares Lizardo, 33.</p>
    <p>Three of the charges Tan is fac­ing in­volve Ms Lizardo, while the re­main­ing five in­volve Ms Jene­fer Aran­gote Ve­gafria, 39.</p>
    <p>Tan al­legedly pinched Ms Ve­gafria in the ab­domen, arm, thigh and chest on var­i­ous oc­ca­sions in Septem­ber 2018 in her home.</p>
    <p>She is also said to have kicked Ms Lizardo in the chest and hit her head in Oc­to­ber 2018, and also struck her torso with a stick in an­other in­stance that year.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Tan’s al­leged acts of abuse came to light after Ms Ve­gafria’s friend, an­other maid, called the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), which in turn in­formed the po­lice on Oct 17, 2018.</p>
    <p>Tan is rep­re­sented by lawyers Su­nil Sud­heesan and Diana Ngiam of Quahe Woo & Palmer.</p>
    <p>Records by the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity show that Sim is the owner of a com­pany deal­ing in ve­hi­cle tyres and bat­ter­ies, as well as a direc­tor in three other firms.</p>
    <p>He is fac­ing charges un­der the Em­ploy­ment of For­eign Man­power Act, ac­cord­ing to court records.</p>
    <p>Among other things, he is ac­cused of em­ploy­ing Ms Lizardo with­out a valid work pass from Oct 23, 2015, to Dec 1, 2016.</p>
    <p>He also al­legedly con­spired with an­other in­di­vid­ual in 2015 to falsely state, in an ap­pli­ca­tion to the MOM for Ms Lizardo’s work per­mit, that she was to be em­ployed at an­other res­i­dence in­stead of his home.</p>
    <p>Sim’s case is ex­pected to be heard in court to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent of Po­lice (ASP) Lynn Tan tes­ti­fied yes­ter­day that she was among a group of po­lice of­fi­cers present at Tan’s house on Oct 17, 2018. She said she spoke to the maids and they claimed they had been abused by Tan at mul­ti­ple places in the home.</p>
    <p>ASP Tan said that although there were closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­eras in­stalled in the home, there was no footage stored in the server as it was miss­ing its hard disk.</p>
    <p>Tan’s trial is ex­pected to re­sume to­day, with one of the vic­tims tak­ing the stand.</p>
