    <p>Four mosques in Sin­ga­pore will open ad­di­tional en­try and exit points or stag­ger the tim­ings for ar­rivals and de­par­tures of con­gre­gants, in a move to pre­pare for more wor­ship­pers on Fri­day and keep them safe from Covid-19. These ex­tra steps are to pre­vent the mix­ing of con­gre­gants to re­duce the risk of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Four mosques in Sin­ga­pore will open ad­di­tional en­try and exit points or stag­ger the tim­ings for ar­rivals and de­par­tures of con­gre­gants, in a move to pre­pare for more wor­ship­pers on Fri­day and keep them safe from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These ex­tra steps at Masjid Assyafaah, Masjid Mu­jahidin, Masjid Al-Istigh­far and Masjid Al-Iman are to pre­vent the mix­ing of con­gre­gants, thereby re­duc­ing the risk of in­fec­tion dur­ing prayer ses­sions, an Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) spokesman told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment had an­nounced on Mon­day that it would ease some Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>As a pi­lot test, 12 re­li­gious places will be al­lowed to hold gath­er­ings of up to 100 peo­ple – double the num­ber they are now al­lowed to host at any one time.</p>
    <p>The four mosques in this pi­lot will each im­ple­ment dual zones for con­gre­gants to pray.</p>
    <p>Muis said this would open up 600 more places for the three prayer ses­sions on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Mon­day, Min­is­ter-in-Charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said that while he is happy about the ad­di­tional spa­ces, there is still a need to be care­ful as the risk of com­mu­nity in­fec­tion re­mains high, point­ing to new waves of in­fec­tions glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“I urge the com­mu­nity to re­main re­silient and pa­tient, to fol­low the safe man­age­ment mea­sures that are in place and co­op­er­ate with the mosque of­fi­cers and vol­un­teers,” said Mr Masa­gos, who is also the Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate Face­book post yes­ter­day, Muis said it has been re­ceiv­ing queries on why con­gre­gants could not make re­peat book­ings for Fri­day prayers.</p>
    <p>It ex­plained that when con­gre­gants were first al­lowed to book prayer slots on­line for ses­sions from June 26, it had stated they could book only one slot for the fol­low­ing three weeks.</p>
    <p>More spa­ces were pro­vided sub­se­quently, but con­gre­gants were in­formed that only those who had yet to ob­tain a slot could reg­is­ter for one.</p>
    <p>Such pri­or­ity will con­tinue to be given to those who have not had a chance to do their Fri­day prayers in a mosque since June 26 as “this is still a large group”, said Muis.</p>
    <p>“We will in­form very clearly in our an­nounce­ments when there are suf­fi­cient slots to al­low for re­peat reg­is­tra­tion,” it added.</p>
    <p>STAY­ING VIG­I­LANT</p>
    <p>I urge the com­mu­nity to re­main re­silient and pa­tient, to fol­low the safe man­age­ment mea­sures that are in place and co­op­er­ate with the mosque of­fi­cers ’’ and vol­un­teers. MIN­IS­TER-IN-CHARGE OF MUS­LIM AF­FAIRS MASA­GOS ZULK­I­FLI, on the need to be care­ful as the risk of com­mu­nity in­fec­tion re­mains high.</p>
