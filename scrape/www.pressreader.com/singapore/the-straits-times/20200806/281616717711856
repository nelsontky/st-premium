    <p>The Cen­tral De­pos­i­tory (CDP) and two other or­gan­i­sa­tions have been fined a to­tal of $47,000 for breach­ing data pri­vacy laws.</p>
    <p>CDP re­ceived the big­gest fine of $32,000 af­ter it mailed div­i­dend cheques to out­dated ad­dresses, putting more than 200 ac­count hold­ers at risk of hav­ing their per­sonal data dis­closed.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a writ­ten de­ci­sion by the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion (PDPC) pub­lished on its web­site on Mon­day, the CDP had mailed the cheques con­tain­ing per­sonal in­for­ma­tion such as names and NRIC num­bers to out­dated ad­dresses af­ter it mi­grated its soft­ware sys­tem in De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Tests of the new sys­tem, which cap­tured ac­count hold­ers’ up­dated ad­dresses as well as his­tor­i­cal ad­dresses, did not in­clude the sce­nario of a change of ad­dress in the au­to­mated gen­er­a­tion of div­i­dend cheque mail­ers.</p>
    <p>This led to the mail­ing of div­i­dend cheques to pos­si­bly 211 CDP ac­count hold­ers at their old ad­dresses – a num­ber de­duced from the cheques not pre­sented for pay­ment.</p>
    <p>The data breach was re­vealed af­ter an ac­count holder com­plained in March last year that the CDP had sent a div­i­dend cheque to an out­dated ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The two other or­gan­i­sa­tions are the Sin­ga­pore Ac­coun­tancy Com­mis­sion (SAC) and ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tute MDIS Cor­po­ra­tion, which were fined $5,000 and $10,000 re­spec­tively, for their breaches.</p>
    <p>In the case of the SAC, a folder con­tain­ing per­sonal data of 6,541 Sin­ga­pore Char­tered Ac­coun­tant Qual­i­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme per­son­nel and can­di­dates was mis­tak­enly en­closed in e-mails sent to 41 un­in­tended re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>As for MDIS, the in­for­ma­tion of more than 300 peo­ple, who had pro­vided their per­sonal data to regis­ter for its cour­ses, was pub­licly avail­able on its web­site. The slipup came to light when one of those af­fected dis­cov­ered that she was able to ac­cess a spread­sheet con­tain­ing the in­for­ma­tion through a Google search of her NRIC num­ber.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, an­other five or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing in­sur­ance provider FWD Sin­ga­pore and beauty group Jean Yip Salon, were given warn­ings for fail­ing to put in place rea­son­able se­cu­rity ar­range­ments to pre­vent the unau­tho­rised dis­clo­sure of per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>The PDPC, Sin­ga­pore’s pri­vacy watch­dog, re­leased doc­u­ments re­lat­ing to these cases on its web­site on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>CDP re­ceived the big­gest fine of $32,000 af­ter it mailed div­i­dend cheques to out­dated ad­dresses, putting more than 200 ac­count hold­ers at risk of hav­ing their per­sonal data dis­closed.</p>
