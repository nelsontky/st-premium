    <p>In a rare move, the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) will re­view its wage guide­lines for a se­cond time this year as the Covid-19 pan­demic takes a toll on the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo an­nounced this in a Face­book post yes­ter­day af­ter a meet­ing last week with Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap to dis­cuss con­cerns on the ground.</p>
    <p>“Both the views of work­ers and em­ploy­ers mat­ter, es­pe­cially at this crit­i­cal time... We will re­main in close con­sul­ta­tion on jobs and the econ­omy,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>She said they agreed to re­con­vene the NWC, which is usu­ally con­vened once a year. More de­tails will be pro­vided later this month, The Straits Times un­der­stands.</p>
    <p>The high-level coun­cil, which is chaired by DBS Bank chair­man Peter Seah and com­prises rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Gov­ern­ment, em­ploy­ers and unions, had al­ready been con­vened ear­lier than usual this year and re­leased wage rec­om­men­da­tions for April 1 this year to June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines are typ­i­cally for July to June the next year and re­leased in end-May.</p>
    <p>This is only the fourth time since be­ing set up in 1972 that the coun­cil has been con­vened twice in the same year. The pre­vi­ous times came amid ma­jor eco­nomic crises as well, in 2009, 2001 and 1998.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said in his Na­tional Day mes­sage yes­ter­day that there will likely be re­trench­ments, cut­backs and more dif­fi­cult days ahead, even as work­ers have been shielded from the worst eco­nomic ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic through sub­stan­tial gov­ern­ment sup­port.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the pre­lim­i­nary labour mar­ket data for the se­cond quar­ter of the year showed that un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ments surged com­pared with the first quar­ter, and ob­servers said they ex­pect un­em­ploy­ment to climb fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said: “It is quite likely that the spike would have been sharper if not for em­ploy­ers and unions work­ing hand in hand to save jobs through other cost-sav­ing mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>The NWC re­leased its lat­est guide­lines on March 30. It had rec­om­mended, among other things, that em­ploy­ers af­fected by the pan­demic first re­duce non-wage costs and tap gov­ern­ment sup­port be­fore look­ing to re­duce their work­ers’ wages. Spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion should be given to low-wage work­ers earn­ing a ba­sic monthly wage of up to $1,400.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ment should be a last re­sort, it had said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said in her post yes­ter­day that about 3,600 em­ploy­ers no­ti­fied the Min­istry of Man­power of cost-cut­ting mea­sures taken since April that had im­pacted work­ers’ salaries, pro­tect­ing some 150,000 jobs that might oth­er­wise have been lost and work­ers dis­placed.</p>
    <p>Many em­ploy­ers took the cue from the coun­cil’s rec­om­men­da­tions this year, she said. Some are im­ple­ment­ing a flex­i­ble work sched­ule to time-bank the hours not worked while con­tin­u­ing to pay their work­ers’ salaries in full. Oth­ers are help­ing those whose com­mis­sion or over­time pay were cut to get a se­cond job.</p>
    <p>“Many em­ploy­ers will con­tinue to see weak de­mand and face pres­sure to re­trench work­ers. It is there­fore timely for NWC to up­date the tri­par­tite po­si­tion on wages and other is­sues of con­cern to work­ers and em­ploy­ers,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, air­craft en­gine man­u­fac­turer Pratt & Whit­ney laid off about 400 staff here, driven by the pro­longed re­cov­ery pro­jected for com­mer­cial avi­a­tion traf­fic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said in his Na­tional Day mes­sage that NTUC re­mains pre­pared to sup­port work­ers amid th­ese chal­leng­ing times by help­ing to pre­serve jobs and pro­vid­ing care and sup­port for those in need.</p>
    <p>“I call on our (tri­par­tite) part­ners to­day to con­tinue work­ing with us, in the spirit of shared re­spon­si­bil­ity and com­mon un­der­stand­ing, to en­sure that we pull through this cri­sis to­gether,” he said.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber 1998, as the full im­pact of the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis on Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy be­came more ap­par­ent, the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) was con­vened a se­cond time that year to re­vise its an­nual wage guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Its orig­i­nal guide­lines, is­sued in May, had called for wage re­straint and non-wage cost-cut­ting mea­sures, as the Trade and In­dus­try Min­istry fore­cast eco­nomic growth for the year of be­tween 2.5 per cent and 4.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>But as the cri­sis de­te­ri­o­rated, the growth fore­cast for the year was re­vised down­wards in June to be­tween 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The NWC in Novem­ber pro­posed that in ad­di­tion to a 10 per­cent­age point cut to em­ploy­ers’ Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tions rec­om­mended by the Com­mit­tee on Sin­ga­pore’s Com­pet­i­tive­ness, to­tal wages for 1998 be cut by 5 per cent to 8 per cent, as com­pared with 1997.</p>
    <p>This year, with Sin­ga­pore headed for its worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, ob­servers sug­gested that the coun­cil con­sider call­ing for more ag­gres­sive wage sup­port, an of­fice to look af­ter gig work­ers and pay hikes for low-wage staff.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that the NWC will re­con­vene this year. The coun­cil made its an­nual wage guide­lines in March this year.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute for Hu­man Re­source Pro­fes­sion­als (IHRP) chief ex­ec­u­tive Mayank Parekh said that with­out the prospect of a near-term re­cov­ery of de­mand, there could be more job losses and wage cuts on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>“It is timely for the NWC to re­view its ear­lier rec­om­men­da­tions and seek sup­port for ad­di­tional mea­sures to safe­guard jobs and en­hance em­ploy­a­bil­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“More ag­gres­sive wage mea­sures, higher sup­port for job re­design and re-train­ing and ad­di­tional guide­lines on re­trench­ment pay­ments could be con­sid­ered.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem sug­gested the coun­cil look at whether the Jobs Sup­port Scheme of wage sub­si­dies can be ex­tended, as well as the need for fund­ing to fa­cil­i­tate job re­design for fu­ture-ready jobs.</p>
    <p>It could also pro­pose the set­ting up of a tri­par­tite of­fice to help and pro­tect gig work­ers, who tend to fall un­der the radar be­cause they do not have em­ploy­ers, she said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Zainal Sapari said the NWC should con­tinue to push for wage in­creases for low-wage work­ers, even amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of rec­om­mend­ing a quan­tum wage in­crease, I would like NWC to set a long-term tar­get of where wages of th­ese vul­ner­a­ble low-wage work­ers who are per­form­ing es­sen­tial ser­vices should be at. This could then act as a guide­line for the wage in­creases and the nec­es­sary pro­duc­tiv­ity ini­tia­tives that must be em­barked upon to make it sus­tain­able,” he added.</p>
    <p>This is only the fourth time since be­ing set up in 1972 that the coun­cil has been con­vened twice in the same year.</p>
    <p>Aside from 1998, it also re­leased re­vised rec­om­men­da­tions in 2001, af­ter the Sept 11 at­tacks on the United States, and in 2009 amid the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2009, the coun­cil up­dated its guide­lines to rec­om­mend – among other things – that com­pa­nies work with unions and work­ers to man­age costs, such as through wage freezes or wage cuts, to save jobs.</p>
    <p>The NWC had in March this year con­sid­ered whether to rec­om­mend re­duc­ing CPF con­tri­bu­tion rates to cut wage costs.</p>
    <p>But Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Man­power Aubeck Kam had said then that as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme wage sub­sidy far ex­ceeds the em­ployer CPF con­tri­bu­tion rates of up to 17 per cent, the Gov­ern­ment did not feel that a cut to the rate was war­ranted.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank se­nior econ­o­mist Irvin Seah said that short of ex­tend­ing the JSS pay­outs for worst-hit in­dus­tries, a tem­po­rary cut in em­ployer CPF con­tri­bu­tion rates could be an op­tion the NWC con­sid­ers.</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned that such a move would need to be weighed very care­fully. “It would be a re­duc­tion in work­ers’ sav­ings, on top of al­ready wide­spread wage cuts.”</p>
    <p>Amid re­ports of ma­jor re­trench­ment ex­er­cises in re­cent weeks, Mrs Teo also com­mented yes­ter­day on the Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work pro­posed by the NTUC last month. It in­cludes pro­tect­ing the Sin­ga­porean core of the work­force, while for­eign­ers with spe­cial or crit­i­cal skills could be re­tained as well.</p>
    <p>She said in her Face­book post that the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion will con­sider the frame­work and dis­cuss a mu­tu­ally ac­cept­able way for­ward with NTUC.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the Man­power Min­istry will con­tinue its work on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work, she said, adding that there would be up­dates soon.</p>
    <p>“Tri­par­tite part­ners are aligned on one thing – the need to sup­port our work­ers and busi­nesses through the storm brought about by Covid-19. Much work ahead,” she said.</p>
    <p>BOOST­ING PAY OF LOW-WAGE WORK­ERS</p>
    <p>In­stead of rec­om­mend­ing a quan­tum wage in­crease, I would like NWC to set a long-term tar­get of where wages of th­ese vul­ner­a­ble low-wage work­ers who are per­form­ing es­sen­tial ser­vices should be at.

    <p>NTUC AS­SIS­TANT SEC­RE­TARY-GEN­ERAL ZAINAL SAPARI, who says that the NWC should con­tinue to push for wage in­creases for low-wage work­ers, even amid the pan­demic.</p>
