    <p>The num­ber of new Covid-19 cases here hit three dig­its again yesterday, after daily counts of 61 and 42 on Tues­day and Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) yesterday an­nounced 102 new coro­n­avirus cases, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,497. Four of the five new coro­n­avirus pa­tients in the com­mu­nity are un­linked, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Of these, three were iden­ti­fied as a re­sult of pe­ri­odic screen­ing of work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices who do not live in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The fourth pa­tient was tested as part of the min­istry’s ef­forts to screen in­di­vid­u­als work­ing in front-line Covid-19 op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But fur­ther sero­log­i­cal tests con­ducted on all four pa­tients in­di­cated that these were past in­fec­tions and they are no longer in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The fifth pa­tient in the com­mu­nity was iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case. She had been on quar­an­tine and was tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine her sta­tus, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Golden Vil­lage cinema at VivoCity has been added to a list of places vis­ited by coro­n­avirus pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited them for at least 30 min­utes to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. But close con­tacts would al­ready have been iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Among the six im­ported cases an­nounced yesterday were two Sin­ga­pore­ans – one re­turned from the</p>
    <p>Philip­pines on Tues­day and the other from the United Arab Emi­rates on Aug 1. They were tested while serv­ing their stay-home no­tices.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing four im­ported cases were Filipino sea­men who are spe­cial pass hold­ers. They ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia last Satur­day and did not dis­em­bark.</p>
    <p>The four sub­se­quently re­ported symp­toms and were swabbed while on the ves­sel, where they re­mained un­til their test re­sults came back. They were then taken in am­bu­lances to a hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 91 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yesterday.</p>
    <p>Ten clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries were closed as they have been cleared by the In­ter-Agency Task­force. The dor­mi­to­ries now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who re­cently tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>MOH said there are cur­rently about 21,700 work­ers who are still on quar­an­tine and who will be tested when their quar­an­tine ends. It ex­pects the case counts to re­main high in the com­ing days, be­fore ta­per­ing off.</p>
    <p>With 216 cases dis­charged yesterday, 50,721 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
