    <p>NEW YORK</p>
    <p>• Once again, Amer­i­can pop star Taylor Swift’s mu­sic cat­a­logue has been sold. And, once again, she is deeply un­happy about it.</p>
    <p>For the sec­ond time in 11/ years,</p>
    <p>2 the record­ing rights to Swift’s first six al­bums – LPs that in­clude mega-hits like Love Story, Shake It Off and We Are Never Ever Get­ting Back To­gether – have traded hands and, in re­sponse, Swift (above, left) has dragged pri­vate eq­uity in­vestors into the rough-and-tum­ble pub­lic con­flict of celebrity so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Last sum­mer, mu­sic man­ager Scooter Braun made a deal, es­ti­mated at US$300 mi l l i o n (S$404 mil­lion) to US$350 mil­lion, to buy the Big Ma­chine La­bel Group, the Amer­i­can la­bel that signed Swift when she was a teenager.</p>
    <p>That led to a dra­matic pub­lic clash, when Swift called the deal her “worst-case sce­nario”.</p>
    <p>She called on her le­gions of fans to tell Mr Braun and the Car­lyle Group, the large pri­vate eq­uity firm that is a ma­jor backer of Mr Braun’s com­pany, Ithaca Hold­ings, how they felt about it. Swift also in­di­cated that she planned to re-record new ver­sions of her old mu­sic, thus po­ten­tially de­valu­ing the orig­i­nal as­sets.</p>
    <p>In some ways, Mr Braun’s deal for Big Ma­chine was a rou­tine trans­ac­tion in the mu­sic in­dus­try, where hit cat­a­logues change hands reg­u­larly. But Swift high­lighted the fact that, like most artists, she did not con­trol the rights to her own record­ings, mu­sic videos and al­bum art.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, af­ter news of a deal for Swift’s back cat­a­logue was re­ported by Va­ri­ety, Swift iden­ti­fied the buyer as Sham­rock Cap­i­tal, a Los An­ge­les-based in­vest­ment firm that was founded by Mr Roy E. Dis­ney, a nephew of Walt Dis­ney.</p>
    <p>Swift also said that she had at­tempted to ne­go­ti­ate with Mr Braun to pur­chase her work out­right, but was pre­sented with what she called an un­ac­cept­able nondis­clo­sure agree­ment as a con­di­tion of in­spect­ing Big Ma­chine’s books, which she said she de­clined.</p>
    <p>Sham­rock paid more than US$300 mil­lion for Swift’s cat­a­logue, ac­cord­ing to a per­son briefed on the deal.</p>
    <p>In her state­ment on Mon­day, Swift said that she was mov­ing for­ward with her plans to re-record her ear­lier mu­sic, adding that “it has al­ready proven to be both ex­cit­ing and cre­atively ful­fill­ing”.</p>
    <p>Swift’s com­plaints at the time of Mr Braun’s ini­tial ac­qui­si­tion of her songs shone a spot­light on the is­sue of own­er­ship of mas­ter record­ings – the rights to ex­ploit any record, for sales, stream­ing or li­cens­ing.</p>
    <p>Th­ese rights have tra­di­tion­ally been owned by record com­pa­nies in ex­change for the risk they take in sign­ing new artists. Rel­a­tively few ma­jor-la­bel acts have man­aged to own rights to their record­ings, among them Jay-Z, Me­tal­lica and Janet Jack­son.</p>
    <p>When Swift signed with the Universal Mu­sic Group two years ago, she made own­er­ship of her record­ing rights a pre­req­ui­site of the deal.</p>
