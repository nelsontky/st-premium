    <p>PARIS • World Rugby is to in­tro­duce a “fit and proper” per­son’s test for elected of­fi­cials, rugby union’s global gov­ern­ing body said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The move, rec­om­mended by a working group l ed by for­mer Bri­tish sports min­is­ter Hugh Robert­son, fol­lows ac­cu­sa­tions of back­room deals in the vote for a new chair­man.</p>
    <p>In July, l obby group Pa­cific Rugby Player Wel­fare (PRPW) called for an in­de­pen­dent re­view of the May elec­tion, when in­cum­bent chair­man Bill Beau­mont de­feated pro-re­form can­di­date Agustin Pi­chot.</p>
    <p>PRPW cited me­dia re­ports claim­ing the French Rugby Fed­er­a­tion (FFR), which backed Beau­mont, of­fered Fiji pref­er­en­tial treat­ment in re­turn for its vote.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion ques­tioned how Fiji Rugby Union chair­man</p>
    <p>Fran­cis Kean, who was con­victed of man­slaugh­ter in 2007, was ap­pointed to the World Rugby Council.</p>
    <p>“We are un­der­tak­ing this im­por­tant and nec­es­sary process with the am­bi­tion of im­ple­ment­ing and liv­ing the best pos­si­ble stan­dards of good gov­er­nance, fur­ther­ing the ef­fec­tive­ness and di­ver­sity of our struc­tures, en­sur­ing they re­flect the val­ues and uni­ver­sal­ity of the game,” Beau­mont said of the re­view in a World Rugby state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are head­ing in a very en­cour­ag­ing di­rec­tion – that en­ables us to best achieve our pur­pose of grow­ing the sport world­wide by mak­ing it more rel­e­vant and ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“All of the gov­er­nance prac­tices, pro­cesses and pro­ce­dures we im­ple­ment must be im­ple­mented mean­ing­fully with that pur­pose in mind.”</p>
    <p>Robert­son’s re­view – launched in</p>
    <p>June and was for­mer Bri­tish and Ir­ish Li­ons cap­tain Beau­mont’s idea – also calls for the es­tab­lish­ment of an ethics and con­duct char­ter for elected of­fi­cials, at least 40 per cent of women on com­mit­tees and player rep­re­sen­ta­tion through­out all the com­mit­tee struc­tures.</p>
    <p>“I am de­lighted that the World Rugby Council has given its full en­dorse­ment to the in­terim pack­age of rec­om­men­da­tions made by a very en­gaged and pro­gres­sive working group,” Robert­son said. “These ac­tions will strengthen di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion and, for the first time, in­tro­duce an in­de­pen­dent ethics struc­ture.”</p>
    <p>An up­date on the find­ings will be made to the World Rugby Council in May.</p>
    <p>“We are at ‘half-time’,” ex­plained Robert­son. “In the sec­ond half, we will con­sider the struc­ture of the ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee and the def­i­ni­tion and clas­si­fi­ca­tion of a di­verse and grow­ing fam­ily of na­tional mem­ber unions.”</p>
    <p>New Zealand will host this year’s women’s Rugby World Cup be­fore France stages the men’s com­pe­ti­tion in 2023.</p>
    <p>Lobby group Pa­cific Rugby Player Wel­fare ques­tioned how Fiji Rugby Union chair­man Fran­cis Kean, who was con­victed of man­slaugh­ter in 2007, was ap­pointed to the World Rugby Council.</p>
