    <p>LON­DON • David de Gea is men­tally strong enough to deal with fierce crit­i­cism following a se­ries of costly goal­keep­ing blun­ders for Manch­ester United, man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old Spa­niard’s place as United’s No. 1 is un­der se­vere pres­sure af­ter he was at fault for two goals in United’s 3-1 FA Cup semi-fi­nal de­feat by Chelsea on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It came af­ter de Gea, pre­vi­ously con­sid­ered one of the world’s best goal­keep­ers, com­mit­ted other glar­ing er­rors over the past 18 months. Since the start of last sea­son, he has made seven er­rors lead­ing di­rectly to an op­po­si­tion goal. Only one other goalie in the Premier League, New­cas­tle’s Martin Dubravka, has made more.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer, how­ever, re­fused to be drawn on spec­u­la­tion that de Gea may lose his place to back-up stop­per Ser­gio Romero for their league home game with West Ham to­day.</p>
    <p>“This is not go­ing to be­come a David de Gea press con­fer­ence,” the Nor­we­gian, who also re­vealed de­fender Eric Bailly is un­likely to be fit to face the Ham­mers following the head in­jury he suf­fered against the Blues, said at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We’re just go­ing to stick to­gether. We’ve got two games, so we’re just go­ing to fo­cus on that one.</p>
    <p>“David’s men­tally strong enough to know that his job is to per­form in train­ing the next day and then be ready for the games.”</p>
    <p>Dean Hen­der­son is snap­ping at de Gea’s heels af­ter im­press­ing on loan at Sh­effield United, while Romero waits in the wings.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer has a sig­nif­i­cant de­ci­sion to make about the po­si­tion for their penul­ti­mate league match of the sea­son, as vic­tory will give his fifth-placed side a huge boost in the Cham­pi­ons League race.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter’s 3-0 loss at Tot­ten­ham on Sun­day means United are not only level with the fourth-placed Foxes on 62 points but on goal dif­fer­ence as well, with the clubs go­ing toe-to-toe at the King Power Sta­dium in a fas­ci­nat­ing sea­son fi­nale on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>De­spite their 19-game un­beaten run in all com­pe­ti­tions end­ing at the hands of Chelsea, Sol­sk­jaer is con­fi­dent United are on the right track.</p>
    <p>“It (qual­i­fi­ca­tion) is in our own hands,” he said. “I don’t want to talk about how much it (Cham­pi­ons League) will mean fi­nan­cially or to at­tract people. We just have to fo­cus on the next two games and make sure we are there.”</p>
    <p>He has been man­ager at United since De­cem­ber 2018 and de­spite not lift­ing any tro­phies, his po­si­tion seems se­cure.</p>
    <p>Ham­mers coun­ter­part David Moyes also did not win any sil­ver­ware as United man­ager apart from the 2013 Com­mu­nity Shield, but his United ten­ure was short-lived, lasting just 10 months.</p>
    <p>Com­par­ing their time in the Old Traf­ford hot seat, the Scot, whose 16th-placed team are all but safe from rel­e­ga­tion, said yes­ter­day: “The dif­fer­ence be­tween Ole and me is that he’s be­ing given time.</p>
    <p>“He’s bring­ing play­ers in from the academy, which United have al­ways stood for.</p>
    <p>“It’s a won­der­ful club and a bril­liant place to be, and the big­gest club in the world, for me. It’s al­ways a spe­cial place to go and I’m look­ing for­ward to go­ing back.”</p>
    <p>RALLY AROUND</p>
    <p>We’re just go­ing to stick to­gether. We’ve got two games, so we’re just go­ing to fo­cus on that one. David’s men­tally strong enough to know that his job is to per­form in train­ing the next day and then be ready for the games. ’’</p>
