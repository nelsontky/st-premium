    <p>BEI­JING • With a mix­ture of nerves and ex­cite­ment, many chil­dren across China kicked off a new school year yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For about 200 first graders at Chengdu Gar­den (In­ter­na­tional) Pri­mary School, i n south-west China’s Sichuan prov­ince, a brief cer­e­mony was held in the morn­ing to mark a spe­cial mo­ment – their first day at school.</p>
    <p>Each pupil had a rib­bon tied on their left wrist, sym­bol­is­ing hope for the new be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>“I’m al­ready miss­ing my baby, and I don’t know if he can adapt well,” said a par­ent sur­named Ma.</p>
    <p>Be­sides a full set of sta­tionery, she also bought masks, pa­per tow­els and hand sani­tiser for her son.</p>
    <p>“I am wor­ried about him and hope he will have a good day.”</p>
    <p>At 7.40am, a kin­der­garten in Wuhan, a city once hit hard by the coro­n­avirus, wel­comed its first batch of pupils. Ms Hu Meng, a teacher, greeted every one of the 18 chil­dren in her class.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Hu, she and four other teach­ers had be­gun pre­par­ing for the new se­mes­ter since May.</p>
    <p>Af­ter rounds of dis­in­fec­tion and epi­demic preven­tion drills, the kin­der­garten fi­nally opened yes­ter­day, with comics and light-hearted slo­gans on epi­demic preven­tion seen around the school.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial data shows that a to­tal of 2,842 kinder­gartens, pri­mary and sec­ondary schools in Wuhan opened their doors yes­ter­day, to wel­come some 1.4 mil­lion stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang Chifu, deputy di­rec­tor of the city’s ed­u­ca­tion bureau, said pri­mary and sec­ondary school stu­dents in Wuhan should carry masks with them, but they do not have to wear them at school.</p>
    <p>Wuhan cur­rently has no con­firmed Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, there were a to­tal of 216 con­firmed Covid-19 cases on the Chi­nese main­land as of Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Though the pan­demic has waned in China, schools at all lev­els still took strict anti-epi­demic mea­sures to safe­guard the health of stu­dents.</p>
    <p>At about 7am, se­nior stu­dents at Wuhan No. 49 Mid­dle School stepped onto cam­pus for a new se­mes­ter. Af­ter hav­ing their tem­per­a­tures taken, they were guided to their class­rooms along a spe­cial­ly­de­signed route.</p>
    <p>Ten min­utes later, stu­dents from an­other grade en­tered the school through an­other route.</p>
    <p>“The safety and health of teach­ers and stu­dents are our top pri­or­ity,” said school of­fi­cial Yin Weiguo.</p>
    <p>“A thor­ough dis­in­fec­tion has been con­ducted in all class­rooms, can­teens, dor­mi­to­ries and toi­lets and will be car­ried out every day.</p>
    <p>“Anti-epi­demic sup­plies such as masks and hand sani­tiser are also avail­able in each class­room.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar mea­sures are be­ing im­ple­mented in schools across the coun­try, with stu­dents in Shang­hai, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Guang­dong and Yun­nan also ush­er­ing in their new semesters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The big­gest change this se­mes­ter is that we no longer have to wear masks in class,” said Gan Siqi, a se­cond grader at a ju­nior high school in Li­uyang city, in cen­tral China’s Hu­nan prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“Though we still have to take body tem­per­a­tures reg­u­larly, we’re not as ner­vous as last se­mes­ter.”</p>
