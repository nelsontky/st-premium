    <p>TROON (United King­dom) • Dani Holmqvist has suf­fered her fair share of scary mo­ments – in­clud­ing be­ing bit­ten by a black widow spi­der – but they served her well in bat­tling bru­tal con­di­tions to lead at the half­way stage of the Women’s Bri­tish Open.</p>
    <p>The Swede shot a one-un­der 70 in Royal Troon’s wind and rain to fin­ish on 141, the only player un­der par and one ahead of Amer­i­can Austin Ernst (70) and Ger­man Sophia Popov (72).</p>
    <p>The duo were a stroke ahead of a group that in­cluded two-time Ma­jor win­ner Ly­dia Ko. But Hi­nako Shi­buno’s ti­tle de­fence ended after the 21-year-old from Ja­pan added a 78 to an open­ing 76 and com­fort­ably missed the cut at 12 over.</p>
    <p>In 2013, Holmqvist was bit­ten by a deadly black widow spi­der while com­pet­ing in the Aus­tralian Open. Two years ago, she was thrown against a wall when a golf cart flipped over in China. The lat­ter in­ci­dent left her in se­ri­ous pain and in need of med­i­ca­tion to even play.</p>
    <p>Now she wants to em­u­late 2016 men’s Bri­tish Open cham­pion Hen­rik Sten­son and be­come a Swedish win­ner of a Ma­jor ti­tle at Troon.</p>
    <p>“It was really bru­tal out there,” she said. “Through­out the first nine there were cross winds and driv­ing rain. It was tough.”</p>
    <p>An­nika Soren­stam was the last Swede to win the ti­tle at Lytham in 2003 and the former world No.1 has had a big in­flu­ence on Holmqvist.</p>
    <p>“We both come from Stock­holm and she has al­ways been a great role model,” said the 32-year-old. “She used to come to na­tional team get-to­geth­ers and I had a lot of one to one time with her. Every­one in Swe­den looks up to her.”</p>
    <p>Ko, 23, won two Ma­jors as a teenager but the last of her 15 LPGA vic­to­ries was the 2018 Medi­heal Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“It was su­per tough out there,” said the New Zealan­der. “But I played a really solid round. Now I just need to stay pa­tient over the week­end.”</p>
