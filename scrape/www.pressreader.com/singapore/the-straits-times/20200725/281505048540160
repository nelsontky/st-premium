    <p>Vet­eran pas­try chef Ana Fong fondly re­mem­bers shar­ing one of her fam­ily busi­ness’ past spe­cial­i­ties – a hy­brid be­tween a cake and a pas­try – with her sib­lings when she was a child.</p>
    <p>It has been nearly four decades since the com­pany last sold the pas­try, but the gen­eral man­ager of 85-year-old home-grown pas­try shop Tong Heng is now re­liv­ing her child­hood mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>The shop is bring­ing back the cre­ation – named CakeXPas­try – from Aug 8 at its Chi­na­town out­let to cel­e­brate Sin­ga­pore’s 55th birth­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Fong and her bosses, who are also her aunts, have tried to modernise the pas­try while pay­ing trib­ute to “flavours of the past”.</p>
    <p>Be­sides its tra­di­tional red bean, it will come with up­dated flavours of chest­nut, black se­same and red date. It will also come in cup­cake-like por­tions, in­stead of its long shape in the past.</p>
    <p>“We want to rein­tro­duce such flavours, which older gen­er­a­tions can ap­pre­ci­ate, and also ex­pose the flavours to younger gen­er­a­tions so they won’t for­get them,” said Ms Fong, who is in her 50s and a fourth-gen­er­a­tion mem­ber of the fam­ily-run busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Pro­ceeds will go to The Courage Fund to help those af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The pas­try is among a va­ri­ety of items cre­ated by more than 30 lo­cal brands to cel­e­brate Na­tional Day. These items will be avail­able for sale – some of them from to­day – un­der a cam­paign or­gan­ised by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) to drive aware­ness of lo­cal brands.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign is a part of the Na­tional Day Pa­rade Sin­ga­pore To­gether Pack ini­tia­tive, which comes with pro­mo­tions and dis­count voucher codes for goods and ser­vices. Shop­pers can go to https://dis­counts.life.gov.sg to view the deals.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (SRA) also has a list­ing of lo­cal brands’ prod­ucts com­mem­o­rat­ing Na­tional Day, which are fea­tured on gospree.sg</p>
    <p>Be­sides food, the cam­paign in­cludes deals on other prod­ucts such as ser­vices and re­tail items. These in­clude life­style goods from so­cial en­ter­prise The An­i­mal Project (TAP), which show­cases the artis­tic tal­ents of peo­ple with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers who spend more than $20 on TAP prod­ucts at its Lazada e-store will re­ceive a Mer­lion key­chain de­signed by spe­cial needs artist Tay Jun-Yi, 24.</p>
    <p>His father, Mr Roland Tay, who founded TAP, said: “It’s a proud mo­ment for Jun-Yi to be able to con­trib­ute some­thing for the na­tion.”</p>
    <p>ESG deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Ted Tan said the agency is heart­ened to see lo­cal food and bev­er­age (F&B) and life­style brands in­no­vate and cre­ate uniquely Sin­ga­pore prod­ucts and ex­pe­ri­ences to unite peo­ple over the Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions, even amid chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>“Through these ex­cit­ing deals jointly cu­rated by ESG and SRA, we hope that con­sumers can re­dis­cover our lo­cal F&B and life­style brands. We en­cour­age con­sumers to sup­port our lo­cal com­pa­nies and ex­plore their in­no­va­tive of­fer­ings,” he said.</p>
