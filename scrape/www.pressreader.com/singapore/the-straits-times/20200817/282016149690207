    <p>A group of peo­ple at a shop­ping mall came to­gether and helped a man strug­gling to man­age his el­derly mother, who had soiled her­self.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent came to light after one of the good Sa­mar­i­tans, Ms Scar­lett Chong, 39, who works in busi­ness devel­op­ment, put up a post on Face­book last Wednesday. It had gar­nered more than 4,100 re­ac­tions and 2,200 shares as of 4pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong said that she was at Jem shop­ping mall last Wednesday af­ter­noon for a late lunch and, while go­ing up the es­ca­la­tor, heard a com­mo­tion com­ing from a toi­let cu­bi­cle for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Hear­ing shouts, she went to in­ves­ti­gate and found that an el­derly woman, who had de­men­tia, had soiled her­self, and her son was hav­ing trou­ble man­ag­ing her, as well as his own com­po­sure.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong told The Straits Times that a group of peo­ple pass­ing by, all of whom were staff of the Don Don Donki dis­count chain, called the mall’s se­cu­rity team for help. The po­lice were also called.</p>
    <p>In an ef­fort to find some clean clothes for the woman, Ms Chong ap­proached the nearby Love, Bonito ap­parel store, where staff mem­ber Car­men Chng im­me­di­ately took a dress off the rack and handed it to her.</p>
    <p>Se­nior se­cu­rity of­fi­cer Mariama Rat­nasamy, 37, and Mr David Tan, 48, se­nior fa­cil­i­ties su­per­vi­sor from Lendlease, which man­ages the mall, were in the mean­time com­fort­ing the woman, who could only con­verse in Hokkien.</p>
    <p>Not able to speak the dialect, Ms Rat­nasamy, who is from Hen­der­son Se­cu­rity Ser­vices, gen­tly held the woman’s arm while Mr Tan joked with her.</p>
    <p>Ground Re­sponse Force of­fi­cer Im­ran Moosa and other po­lice of­fi­cers who ar­rived on the scene were able to calm the woman’s son, as well as con­nect with the woman, said Ms Chong.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Staff Sergeant Im­ran, 37, told The Straits Times that he had ex­pe­ri­ence in­ter­act­ing with se­niors who have spe­cial needs, as his late fa­ther-in­law had suf­fered a stroke and had de­men­tia in his fi­nal years, while his mother-in-law uses a wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>“I know it can be quite stress­ful from a care­giver’s point of view, and such el­derly peo­ple can be quite emo­tional, so a lot of pa­tience is re­quired,” he added. Se­nior Staff Sgt Im­ran later paid for the dress. Ms Chng, 23, a re­tail as­so­ci­ate at Love, Bonito, said that she did not ex­pect the dress to be re­turned or paid for when she handed it over. “It was a very nice ges­ture out of good­will by the po­lice of­fi­cer,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong said she had posted the story on Face­book in the hope that it would reach those who had helped the woman and her son, to show them her ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>She said: “It’s the story of how these in­di­vid­u­als came to­gether to help. I think they should be cel­e­brated.”</p>
    <p>Se­nior Staff Sgt Im­ran agreed: “Most of the time, Sin­ga­pore­ans are very car­ing. This shows we have a so­ci­ety that has love and com­pas­sion, and it is very com­fort­ing to know that many peo­ple among us want to lend a help­ing hand, es­pe­cially to those who are in need.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chong noted that care­givers had re­sponded to her post, say­ing they felt en­cour­aged by it and could iden­tify with the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>She said: “I’m glad this has also helped them to know that there are peo­ple out there who are more than will­ing to help and talk to them. Many times, care­givers might not be aware that they need to be cared for them­selves too.”</p>
