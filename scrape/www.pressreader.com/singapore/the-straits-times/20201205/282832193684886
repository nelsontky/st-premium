    <p>For a more sus­tain­able Christ­mas, try re­pur­pos­ing old Christ­mas trees and or­na­ments with a huge dol­lop of cre­ativ­ity. Artist, writer and ed­u­ca­tor Lucinda Law, who founded the na­ture-based on­line art work­shop and e-store Within.com, short­lists six fun and easy ways.</p>
    <p>Bring in a whiff of wilder­ness and well-be­ing</p>
    <p>Ms Law says that smell cre­ates an in­stant fes­tive mood and is just as im­por­tant as lights and or­na­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“Amp up the sen­sory ap­peal by in­tro­duc­ing scent to your tree. Adding pine nee­dle es­sen­tial oils to small scented wooden sticks and ty­ing these to an old tree makes it smell like new again.”</p>
    <p>She says es­sen­tial oils are also ideal for cre­at­ing a feel­ing of well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Have a ball with washi tape</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery­one in the house­hold can get cre­ative in up­dat­ing their old baubles by stick­ing cre­ative em­bel­lish­ments such as Christ­mas-themed washi tape on worn-out or­na­ment balls.</p>
    <p>Make a scrap rib­bon tree or­na­ment to hang on a tree or door</p>
    <p>Old rib­bons from last year’s tree can be re­pur­posed into star shapes or flo­rets held to­gether with tape or glue.</p>
    <p>Cut up your old tree</p>
    <p>In­stead of a sin­gle tree, make your house lush with sprigs of Christ­mas tree or­na­ments, says Ms Law.</p>
    <p>Cut up your old tree to make them into smaller sprigs and tie them with old baubles and rib­bons to cre­ate a fes­tive feel through­out the house.</p>
    <p>Show­case old baubles in glass</p>
    <p>Re­use baubles by giv­ing them a new home in a glass vase. Sim­ply weave in cop­per fairy lights into the vase and around the balls to make them look ex­tra fes­tive and dreamy.</p>
    <p>Paint your old tree</p>
    <p>Re­ju­ve­nate last year’s Christ­mas tree with wa­ter-based paint sold in art sup­plies stores such as Art Friend in Bras Basah Com­plex and Straits Art Com­pany in North Bridge Road. Gold and sil­ver paint sprin­kled with metal­lic dust are favourites.</p>
    <p>“But day-glow pink might just be the con­ver­sa­tion starter in the room,” says Ms Law.</p>
