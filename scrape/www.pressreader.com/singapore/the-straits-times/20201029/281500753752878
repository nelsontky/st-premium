    <p>A se­ries of un­re­solved cable faults which had be­set the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion since it opened in 2017 led to the mas­sive three­line MRT break­down on Oct 14.</p>
    <p>All the power ca­bles on the ex­ten­sion will now be re­placed. In all, French en­gi­neer­ing group Al­stom – which in­stalled the power lines – will re­place 150km of ca­bles with new ones of a higher qual­ity.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion came af­ter a sec­tion of ca­bles burnt through on Oct 14. The fail­ure would have been iso­lated by cir­cuit break­ers in the area – as was the case in four pre­vi­ous in­ci­dents. But on Oct 14, one failed to work. In fact, it melted from the heat.</p>
    <p>Al­stom will also re­place 113 trip coils – the main com­po­nent of cir­cuit break­ers – in this three-year-old ex­ten­sion of the East-West MRT line.</p>
    <p>The move – which will in­volve early clo­sures and late open­ings of sta­tions over week­ends up till the end of next year – is rem­i­nis­cent of the re-ca­bling ex­er­cise for the equally new Cir­cle Line.</p>
    <p>In 2012, af­ter re­peated pow­er­re­lated train dis­rup­tions on the or­bital line, the fault was traced to power ca­bles – also in­stalled by Al­stom – which were ex­posed to wa­ter in the train tun­nels.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion was made then to re­place the ca­bles, which usu­ally last 20 to 30 years, with a more wa­ter-re­sis­tant type. The ex­er­cise, in­volv­ing 120km of ca­bles, was com­pleted in 2014 for $15 mil­lion. Al­stom was said to have borne the bulk of the cost.</p>
    <p>All elec­tri­cal power ca­bles along the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion will be re­placed fol­low­ing a mas­sive three­line MRT break­down which left more than 6,700 pas­sen­gers stuck on stranded trains for up to three hours on Oct 14.</p>
    <p>In a joint brief­ing with rail op­er­a­tor SMRT and sys­tems sup­plier Al­stom yes­ter­day, the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) said the French com­pany will re­place some 150km of ca­bles which sup­ply power to trains by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The re­place­ment ca­bles will have tougher in­su­la­tion, Al­stom in­di­cated. It will also re­place all 113 trip coils – core com­po­nents of cir­cuit break­ers – along the three-year-old western stretch of the East-West Line by the end of this year. The com­pany will do so at its own cost, which it did not di­vulge.</p>
    <p>SMRT said the Oct 14 break­down dur­ing the evening peak hour af­fected around 123,000 com­muters – 110,000 on the North-South and East-West Lines for 31/ hours; as</p>
    <p>2 well as 13,000 on the Cir­cle Line for just over an hour.</p>
    <p>The mas­sive dis­rup­tion was traced to a burnt sec­tion of ca­bles be­tween Tuas Link and Tuas West Road sta­tions.</p>
    <p>The fault would have been iso­lated by cir­cuit break­ers in the vicin­ity, but one failed to trip as de­signed to be­cause of a faulty trip coil.</p>
    <p>This caused a sec­ondary pro­tec­tion sys­tem to trip, cut­ting power sup­ply from a Tuas sub­sta­tion to a stretch of sta­tions along the North­South and East-West Lines.</p>
    <p>SMRT then de­cided to draw power from an al­ter­na­tive sub­sta­tion in Buona Vista. But it did so with­out first iso­lat­ing the power fault in Tuas, and hence al­lowed the elec­tri­cal glitch to af­fect the Cir­cle Line.</p>
    <p>SMRT chief ex­ec­u­tive Neo Kian Hong said a staff mem­ber and a su­per­vi­sor had mis­read equip­ment at the sub­sta­tion and thought the fault had been iso­lated. The two have since been sus­pended from duty, he added.</p>
    <p>It was re­vealed at the brief­ing that four sim­i­lar cable faults had been de­tected since the Tuas West Ex­ten­sion opened in 2017.</p>
    <p>These ear­lier faults did not lead to any wide­spread ser­vice dis­rup­tion be­cause cir­cuit break­ers meant to iso­late them worked, LTA said.</p>
    <p>It raised the mat­ter of the faulty ca­bles with Al­stom in Jan­uary this year and the con­trac­tor agreed to re­place the up­per layer of ca­bles. Re­place­ment work was to have started this month.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo had also said trip coils along the af­fected stretch were last checked on Oct 6, j ust a week be­fore the break­down.</p>
    <p>LTA said there will be early clo­sures and late open­ings on week­ends from next month to fa­cil­i­tate</p>
    <p>the trip coil re­place­ment.</p>
    <p>There may be full-day clo­sures on Sun­days next year when the cable re­place­ment takes place.</p>
    <p>LTA said the af­fected ca­bles were of sim­i­lar de­sign and made by the same man­u­fac­turer as those i n other parts of the MRT network.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit break­ers are also of “es­tab­lished de­sign” and widely used in the power in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>On its part, SMRT said it will now test cir­cuit break­ers ev­ery six months in­stead of 12.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tor added that it will “en­hance pro­ce­dures for power re­cov­ery” so that the hu­man er­ror which al­lowed the Oct 14 fault to spread to the Cir­cle Line “will not re­cur”.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time power ca­bles on a rel­a­tively new line are be­ing re­placed. In 2012, when the Cir­cle Line was around three years old, 120km of its ca­bles – also laid by Al­stom – was re­placed with more wa­ter-re­sis­tant ca­bles at a cost of $15 mil­lion. The bulk of the re­place­ment cost was borne by Al­stom.</p>
    <p>At yes­ter­day’s brief­ing, the French con­trac­tor said it was still in­ves­ti­gat­ing what caused the ca­bles and trip coils to fail.</p>
    <p>LTA’s new chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Lang, just over a month into the job, said the break­down was a stark re­minder that the work to keep the rail sys­tem reli­able was an un­end­ing jour­ney which could be dis­rupted by the small­est of faults.</p>
