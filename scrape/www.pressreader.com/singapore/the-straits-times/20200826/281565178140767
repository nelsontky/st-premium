    <p>A man who went ahead with plans to have drinks with a big group of friends dur­ing phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid the Covid-19 pan­demic. The group of 13 had gath­ered il­le­gally un­til the wee hours at a fit­ness cor­ner near his block.</p>
    <p>A man who went ahead with plans to have drinks with a big group of friends dur­ing phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing pleaded guilty yes­ter­day over flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mo­ham­mad Zack Da­nial Ahamad Zaki, 20, and 12 oth­ers, in­clud­ing two mi­nors, gath­ered il­le­gally un­til the wee hours of June 28 at a fit­ness cor­ner near his block where he had set up two por­ta­ble ta­bles.</p>
    <p>They caused such a ruckus that a neigh­bour could not sleep and called the po­lice, com­plain­ing that mem­bers of the group were drink­ing, smok­ing and talk­ing at the fit­ness cor­ner near Block 42 Beo Cres­cent, off Have­lock Road.</p>
    <p>Zack Da­nial and two oth­ers in the group, Sai Raghu Vaish­navee Ragu and Aqlima Ab­dul Azmi, both 19, pleaded guilty to flout­ing rules un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act by gath­er­ing with more than four peo­ple not liv­ing in the same place of res­i­dence as them­selves.</p>
    <p>The three are ex­pected to be sen­tenced on Oct 6 af­ter the court called for pro­ba­tion suit­abil­ity re­ports on them in view of their ages.</p>
    <p>The court heard that all three were un­able to pay the $3,500 fine Deputy Public Prose­cu­tor Ang Siok Chen had ar­gued for. The amount is lower than the fines im­posed on four other mem­bers of the group ear­lier this month in the light of their ages, said the DPP.</p>
    <p>On Aug 5, Nur Sal­iza Mo­hamed Sani, 23, Nu­rul Sheilla Nata­sya Suhaimi, 25, Nu­raznie Ith­nin, 31, and Muham­mad Zaki Jo­hari, 33, were each fined $4,000.</p>
    <p>Zack Da­nial and the two 19-yearolds will have a sec­ond charge un­der the same Act and one charge over drink­ing between 10.30pm and 7am taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Three other Sin­ga­pore­ans – Mo­hamad Iman Ab­dul Rahim, 19, Remy Shah Hail Mee, 20, and Norsyahmi Norhe­sham, 21, who were al­legedly part of the gath­er­ing – also face charges un­der the Act. Their cases are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three i n the group com­prise two boys, aged 14 and 15, and a 26-year-old Malaysian man. The po­lice ear­lier said that the 14-year-old was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing, while the other two have been in­ves­ti­gated for un­re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>As part of phase two of the re­open­ing, which took ef­fect on June 19, groups of up to five peo­ple can meet out­side of their homes but should prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing and avoid mix­ing between dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der t he Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000. A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
