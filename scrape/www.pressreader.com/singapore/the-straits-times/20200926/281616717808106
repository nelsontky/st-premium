    <p>In­done­sian gravedig­ger Adang Sa­pu­tra’s heart breaks every time he hears the all-too-fa­mil­iar pray­ers for the dead and the cries of dis­traught rel­a­tives as the cof­fin of a Covid-19 vic­tim is low­ered into the ground.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old hides his pain as he heaps moist red earth over the grave, plants a wooden head­stone with the name of the dead per­son neatly writ­ten in marker pen in the ground, and of­fers a si­lent prayer.</p>
    <p>Then, al­most me­chan­i­cally, he am­bles to­wards an await­ing am­bu­lance to help un­load the next body for burial.</p>
    <p>As a gravedig­ger for the Pon­dok Rang­gon pub­lic ceme­tery in East Jakarta, one of two des­ig­nated for Covid-19 victims in the In­done­sian cap­i­tal, Mr Adang has had to face the grim scene over and over, some­times more than 30 times a day, for the past six months.</p>
    <p>“In the be­gin­ning, I was scared. I was afraid of get­ting in­fected as I knew noth­ing about Covid-19. I was wor­ried, emo­tional, and there were a lot of bod­ies to be buried,” he told The Straits Times from the ceme­tery, where some 3,000 graves lay.</p>
    <p>“But I try to do my job calmly. I don’t want to think about it too much and be­come stressed.”</p>
    <p>While he has se­cured a 1.5 mil­lion ru­piah (S$139) bonus in ad­di­tion to his 4.2 mil­lion ru­piah monthly salary since March, his life has changed.</p>
    <p>He is now up at the crack of dawn to get to work, ro­tat­ing shifts among two dozen ceme­tery work­ers to bury the dead till as late as 10pm.</p>
    <p>With bod­ies ar­riv­ing at un­pre­dictable times, some­times two or three at once, he no longer goes home for lunch. In­stead, he scarfs down pack­ets of rice with meat and veg­eta­bles and sips cof­fee be­tween buri­als.</p>
    <p>Gravedig­gers like Mr Adang are the un­sung he­roes work­ing tire­lessly be­hind the scenes as the pan­demic con­tin­ues to kill hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple glob­ally.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, the num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties has passed 10,000 – the high­est in South-east Asia – with more than 260,000 in­fec­tions recorded.</p>
    <p>There were 1,661 of­fi­cial deaths in Jakarta as at yes­ter­day, but many be­lieve the ac­tual num­bers to be higher.</p>
    <p>In the world’s most pop­u­lous Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity coun­try of 270 mil­lion peo­ple, fu­neral tra­di­tion dic­tates bod­ies are washed from head to toe and a con­gre­ga­tional prayer ser­vice per­formed be­fore burial.</p>
    <p>But with deaths due to Covid-19, bod­ies and coffins are wrapped in plas­tic and buried within 24 hours, to min­imise any risk of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies are barred from get­ting close to the coffins, though they are al­lowed to gather around the grave af­ter the burial.</p>
    <p>As they hud­dle in the dis­tance, their grief – of­ten mixed with shock – is un­mis­tak­able.</p>
    <p>“Oh Al­lah, I’m so sad, my nephew is now an or­phan,” one rel­a­tive could be heard lament­ing ear­lier this month. An­other said the man who died had been fit enough to par­tic­i­pate in a tele­con­fer­ence the</p>
    <p>EMO­TIONAL TOLL</p>
    <p>In the be­gin­ning, I was scared. I was afraid of get­ting in­fected... I was wor­ried, emo­tional, and there were a lot of bod­ies to be buried... But I try to do my job calmly. I don’t want to think about it too much and be­come stressed.</p>
    <p>GRAVEDIG­GER ADANG SA­PU­TRA, whose big­gest con­cern is to keep his wife and grown-up son safe.</p>
    <p>pre­vi­ous night.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty and fear sur­round­ing Covid-19 have sparked anx­i­ety, and those on the front lines, such as health­care work­ers and gravedig­gers like Mr Adang, have not been spared so­cial stigma and dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Wit­nesses, how­ever, at­test to the care that is taken. Mr Faisal Latif Ah­mad, a 27-year-old fire­man who lives just 300m from the Pon­dok Rang­gon ceme­tery, said the bod­ies are care­fully wrapped in plas­tic be­fore they are buried.</p>
    <p>He said: “We don’t need to be afraid as long as we wear a mask and main­tain our dis­tance.”</p>
    <p>Still, what oth­ers think mat­ters lit­tle to Mr Adang, whose big­gest con­cern is to keep his wife and grownup son safe.</p>
    <p>At the end of a work day, he re­moves his clothes and en­ters his house from a side door clos­est to the bath­room so he can quickly shower be­fore he sees them.</p>
    <p>He is care­ful to keep his loved ones at arm’s length. He said he has slept sep­a­rately from his wife since March.</p>
    <p>“Some­times when I bury the Covid-19 victims, I can’t imag­ine what will hap­pen if the same thing were to be­fall my fam­ily,” he said.</p>
    <p>A strong sense of duty to­wards treat­ing the dead with dig­nity is the rea­son he con­tin­ues do­ing his job, even if it means hav­ing to don pro­tec­tive suits and stuffy masks, rain or shine.</p>
    <p>Mr Adang be­lieves there is a spe­cial place i n heaven f or lives claimed by the deadly virus.</p>
    <p>“I know it’s hard, but I hope the fam­i­lies will be able to let their loved ones go, with sin­cere hearts,” he said, adding: “I hope the de­ceased will be ac­cepted by God and die as mar­tyrs.</p>
    <p>“God will­ing, they will be mar­tyrs.”</p>
