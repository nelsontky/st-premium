    <p>A hus­band and wife team shar­ing one job po­si­tion may be new to Sin­ga­pore but it is a fairly well es­tab­lished prac­tice in Switzer­land’s for­eign min­istry, which prob­a­bly can claim credit as one of the most pro­gres­sive or­gan­i­sa­tions in the world when it comes to job shar­ing by cou­ples.</p>
    <p>Mrs Bar­bara Gonzen­bach, 42, and Mr Niko­las Sturchler Gonzen­bach, 43, are both deputy head of mis­sion at the Em­bassy of Switzer­land in Sin­ga­pore, re­port­ing to Am­bas­sador Fabrice Fil­liez. They have two chil­dren, Ju­lian, 10, and Leonie, eight, and the job shar­ing is a great boon to them.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, they have pro­fes­sional sat­is­fac­tion furthering the agenda of their gov­ern­ment and on the other hand, they have plenty of fam­ily time. Their home is in the Swiss em­bassy com­pound and the chil­dren go to the Swiss School, which is al­most next door to the em­bassy.</p>
    <p>Says Mrs Gonzen­bach: “Niko­las and I have an elab­o­rate weekly sched­ule that al­lows both of us to work in the morn­ing and in the af­ter­noon, so that each of us can be in touch with head­quar­ters due to time dif­fer­ence and spend time with the chil­dren at home. We both go to the of­fice ev­ery day, so our staff do not have to wait for in­puts and di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Adds Mr Gonzen­bach: “Broadly speak­ing, our job is to look af­ter the bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Switzer­land and rep­re­sent Swiss in­ter­ests in this re­gard. This can range from po­lit­i­cal re­port­ing or or­gan­is­ing of­fi­cial vis­its to so­cial me­dia com­mu­ni­ca­tions, bring­ing to­gether sci­en­tific ac­tors or lin­ing up cul­tural events. Bar­bara and I jointly head our so-called po­lit­i­cal team that looks af­ter such mat­ters.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have a rough di­vi­sion of work in place. While Mr Gonzen­bach cov­ers busi­ness re­la­tions, sci­ence, diplo­macy and le­gal af­fairs, Mrs Gonzen­bach fo­cuses on fi­nance, com­mu­ni­ca­tions, se­cu­rity and cul­ture. In other ar­eas such as po­lit­i­cal re­port­ing, they check on an ad hoc ba­sis as to who has ca­pac­ity and how they want to or­gan­ise them­selves.</p>
    <p>Says Mr Gonzen­bach: “Re­port­edly, Switzer­land was a model for Sin­ga­pore in terms of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Nowa­days, there is also a lot we can learn from Sin­ga­pore. It is ab­so­lutely fas­ci­nat­ing to learn how things are done here and why.</p>
    <p>“My mother was born and raised in Jakarta. While Sin­ga­pore is not Jakarta and times are very dif­fer­ent, I nonethe­less feel as if I am tap­ping a part of my mother’s back­ground.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple met dur­ing their diplo­matic train­ing in Switzer­land when they were both re­cruited in 2007.</p>
    <p>“It was like win­ning the jack­pot. Not only did we get a com­pelling and ful­fill­ing job but, at the same time, we met our life­time part­ner. The ic­ing on the cake was that the FDFA (Fed­eral De­part­ment of For­eign Af­fairs) has a very pro­gres­sive pol­icy when it comes to cou­ples in the diplo­matic ser­vice. Our first shared post­ing abroad was at the Per­ma­nent Mis­sion of Switzer­land to the United Na­tions in New York from 2010 to 2014,” re­calls Mrs Gonzen­bach. Their pre­de­ces­sors in New York were also a cou­ple.</p>
    <p>Adds Mr Gonzen­bach: “The Swiss MFA (Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs) is very forth­com­ing and pro­gres­sive, so that is very help­ful. It is also a fact that while Switzer­land has around 170 rep­re­sen­ta­tions abroad, many of them are small or mid­sized. There are only so many full­time jobs at an em­bassy.</p>
    <p>“Since we ro­tate from post to post as a fam­ily, if you think about it, job­shar­ing is quite a nat­u­ral ar­range­ment. We share the same of­fice and sup­port staff but have our own desks and com­put­ers.”</p>
    <p>The FDFA pro­motes dual ca­reers by sup­port­ing those ac­com­pa­ny­ing their part­ner in their em­ploy­ment. With the pos­si­bil­ity of job shar­ing and dual ca­reer pro­mo­tion, it is po­si­tion­ing it­self as a mod­ern em­ployer, en­abling its staff to achieve a bet­ter bal­ance be­tween ca­reer and per­sonal life.</p>
    <p>Out of a to­tal of about 1,150 full­time trans­fer­able po­si­tions in the FDFA, 18 staff have job-shar­ing ar­range­ments, with 16 of them cur­rently posted abroad.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the cir­cum­stances, Mr and Mrs Gonzen­bach di­vide up the dif­fer­ent top­ics and di­rectly lead dif­fer­ent peo­ple. The beauty of the ar­range­ment is that they get to en­joy their job and fam­ily in a most ful­fill­ing way.</p>
    <p>Says Mrs Gonzen­bach: “If there is an ur­gency or an in­ten­sive pe­riod at the em­bassy, we can both dou­ble our ca­pac­i­ties, which is def­i­nitely a plus for the or­gan­i­sa­tion. Also, we both bring along quite some ex­pe­ri­ence from the 13 years we have been work­ing in the FDFA.</p>
    <p>“We feel that our dif­fer­ent per­son­al­i­ties lead to great out­comes and a happy team. The cir­cuit breaker has been a chal­lenge when we had to be­come the teach­ers of our chil­dren at the same time as man­ag­ing a great work­load at the em­bassy.”</p>
    <p>Adds Mr Gonzen­bach: “We both en­joy our ca­reers and are avoid­ing the ‘trail­ing spouse’ phe­nom­e­non, where one half of the cou­ple is fol­low­ing the ca­reer lead of the other. For sure, we highly rec­om­mend job shar­ing.”</p>
    <p>A big plus for the cou­ple shar­ing a job is that they are able to take leave to­gether just as one per­son does. This en­ables them to go on fam­ily hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“Once a year we usu­ally go to Switzer­land to see fam­ily and friends and catch up with what’s go­ing on in Bern. We usu­ally spend most of our time there in the moun­tains, where we can go for long hikes and en­joy the pris­tine air,” says Mrs Gonzen­bach.</p>
    <p>We both en­joy our ca­reers and are avoid­ing the ‘trail­ing spouse’ phe­nom­e­non, where one half of the cou­ple is fol­low­ing the ca­reer lead of the other. ’’</p>
    <p>MR NIKO­LAS STURCHLER GONZEN­BACH</p>
