    <p>Sin­ga­pore has laid its first charges in the Wire­card scan­dal, ac­cus­ing a direc­tor of Ci­tadelle Cor­po­rate Ser­vices of fal­si­fy­ing ac­counts.</p>
    <p>R. Shan­mu­garat­nam was charged with “wil­fully and with in­tent to de­fraud” fal­si­fy­ing let­ters from Ci­tadelle to Wire­card rep­re­sent­ing that the Sin­ga­pore com­pany held tens of mil­lions in eu­ros in es­crow ac­counts, ac­cord­ing to charge sheets filed last month and seen by Bloomberg News.</p>
    <p>The 54-year-old Sin­ga­porean is the first per­son to be in­dicted here over the spec­tac­u­lar col­lapse of Wire­card.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man dig­i­tal pay­ments com­pany filed for bank­ruptcy in June af­ter dis­clos­ing that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3.1 bil­lion) of cash, sup­posed to be in bank ac­counts in the Philip­pines, did not ex­ist.</p>
    <p>The first of the four charges says that in March 2017, Shan­mu­garat­nam falsely stated that there was a bal­ance of €177.5 mil­lion held by Ci­tadelle in an es­crow ac­count on Dec 31, 2016. The other three charges say that in March 2016, he mis­rep­re­sented that there were €66.4 mil­lion, €47 mil­lion and €30 mil­lion held by Ci­tadelle in three es­crow ac­counts on Dec 31, 2015.</p>
    <p>Shan­mu­garat­nam’s lawyer, Mr N. Sreeni­vasan, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Shan­mu­garat­nam is out on bail of $150,000. If con­victed, he could face a jail term of as long as 10 years for each charge.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is home to Wire­card’s Asia-Pa­cific head­quar­ters, and the com­pany has been ex­pand­ing ag­gres­sively in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Last year, Sin­ga­pore po­lice raided Wire­card’s lo­cal of­fices af­ter an em­ployee al­leged that a mem­ber of the com­pany’s fi­nance team en­gaged in ac­count­ing breaches.</p>
    <p>Last month, Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment and the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said they launched a joint in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Ci­tadelle, and Senjo Group and its sub­sidiaries. They said the in­ves­ti­ga­tion re­lated to sus­pected fal­si­fi­ca­tion of ac­counts and car­ry­ing on a trust busi­ness without a li­cence.</p>
    <p>Ci­tadelle is also at the heart of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion in the Philip­pines that ex­posed fraud­u­lent ac­tiv­ity at Wire­card. Two Philip­pine banks have said that rogue em­ploy­ees fal­si­fied doc­u­ments that in­di­cated they held some Wire­card funds.</p>
    <p>Ci­tadelle was drawn into the spot­light af­ter a Filipino lawyer said he opened six euro bank ac­counts in the name of his law firm, MKT Law, on be­half of Ci­tadelle Cor­po­rate. The ac­counts were sup­pos­edly for Wire­card.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the au­thor­i­ties in the Philip­pines are in­ves­ti­gat­ing whether a for­mer Asian ex­ec­u­tive of Wire­card died, Jus­tice Sec­re­tary Me­nardo Gue­varra said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said the Jus­tice Depart­ment is ver­i­fy­ing if the per­son named “Christo­pher Rein­hard Bauer”, who re­port­edly died last week, is the same per­son as the for­mer Wire­card of­fi­cial who is part of an on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the fraud. Also part of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is to find out the cause of death, Mr Gue­varra said.</p>
    <p>He said the Jus­tice Depart­ment has been look­ing at an in­ward re­mit­tance to Mr Bauer’s ac­count from Wire­card Asia in 2015, without giv­ing more de­tails.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nan­cial Times on Thursday re­ported on the death of Mr Bauer, link­ing him and his Manila-based PayEasy Solutions to a probe in­volv­ing Wire­card’s part­ner busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The Wire­card scan­dal has con­tin­ued to widen and now threat­ens to en­gulf top politi­cians, reg­u­la­tors and au­di­tors in Ger­many. For­mer Wire­card chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Markus Braun was re-ar­rested last month as Ger­man prosecutor­s said the com­pany knew about mas­sive losses as early as 2015.</p>
    <p>Com­merzbank aban­doned its goal for a ful­lyear profit af­ter losses tied to Wire­card and the in­sol­vency left gap­ing holes in the in­come state­ments of ING Groep and Credit Agri­cole.</p>
