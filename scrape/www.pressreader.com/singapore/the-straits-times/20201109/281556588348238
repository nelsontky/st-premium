    <p>After China’s Fifth Plenum meet­ing of its com­mu­nist elite last month, the term bei zhan, or pre­pare for war, ap­peared in its five-year devel­op­ment blue­prints. China cor­re­spon­dent Dan­son Cheong looks at how the coun­try’s lead­er­ship is re­spond­ing to an in­creas­ingly hos­tile ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>China’s Fifth Plenum meet­ing of its com­mu­nist elite ended as ex­pected last month – after four days of se­cret meet­ings in the Chi­nese cap­i­tal, out came a com­mu­nique packed with so­cial­ist jar­gon de­voted mainly to the out­lines of the coun­try’s fu­ture devel­op­ment pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But buried also in the 6,000-plus char­ac­ter read-out were the two Chi­nese char­ac­ters “bei zhan”, or pre­pare for war.</p>
    <p>It ap­peared in the sec­tion of the com­mu­nique on strength­en­ing the mil­i­tary and speed­ing up its mod­erni­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, it said the party’s Cen­tral Com­mit­tee had stressed dur­ing its meet­ings on the need to “com­pre­hen­sively strengthen mil­i­tary train­ing and prepa­ra­tion for war, raise its strate­gic abil­ity to safe­guard the coun­try’s sovereignt­y, se­cu­rity and devel­op­ment in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>The term “bei zhan” again ap­peared in a set of Cen­tral Com­mit­tee “pro­pos­als” re­leased last week that fleshed out de­tails from the com­mu­nique on China’s five-year plan and 15-year vi­sion.</p>
    <p>China watch­ers have pointed out that this is the sec­ond time in over half a cen­tury that the term “bei zhan” has found its way into one of China’s five-year devel­op­ment blue­prints.</p>
    <p>The last time this hap­pened was in the coun­try’s Third Five-Year Plan (1966-1970) when Chi­nese leader Mao Ze­dong called on</p>
    <p>China to pre­pare for war and famine. The 1960s were tense times, Sino-Soviet re­la­tions were rup­tur­ing and China was also fight­ing a bor­der con­flict with In­dia.</p>
    <p>While Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has used sim­i­lar lan­guage be­fore, en­shrin­ing the term into the Fifth Plenum com­mu­nique and the 14th Five-Year Plan takes it a step fur­ther, said Dr Collin Koh, a se­cu­rity ex­pert at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“It now takes the form of a con­crete res­o­lu­tion for the PLA (Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army),” said Dr Koh, adding that this will mean there will be added em­pha­sis on both re­al­is­tic train­ing – mov­ing away from scripted field ex­er­cises and war games – and mod­erni­sa­tion of the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>The fact that the term has ap­peared this time in the Fifth Plenum doc­u­ments – along with what some an­a­lysts are say­ing is a new dead­line to mod­ernise the PLA by its 100th an­niver­sary in 2027 – is also an in­di­ca­tion that there is wide recog­ni­tion among China’s top lead­ers of how the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment is de­te­ri­o­rat­ing and that the PLA ur­gently needs to get on a war foot­ing.</p>
    <p>IS CHINA PRE­PAR­ING FOR WAR?</p>
    <p>The party’s Cen­tral Com­mit­tee last week painted a grim pic­ture of the ex­ter­nal chal­lenges that China faces, point­ing out that “the in­ter­na­tional en­vi­ron­ment is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly com­plex, and in­sta­bil­ity and un­cer­tainty have in­creased sig­nif­i­cantly”.</p>
    <p>It pointed to the widespread im­pact of Covid-19, push­back against glob­al­i­sa­tion, and ris­ing uni­lat­er­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>While it did not men­tion the United States di­rectly, un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, China’s re­la­tions with the world’s big­gest econ­omy have cratered. Washington has la­belled Bei­jing a strate­gic com­peti­tor, and ex­pec­ta­tions are that re­la­tions will con­tinue to be tense, no mat­ter who oc­cu­pies the White House.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing’s eyes, Amer­ica has had a hand in many of the trou­bles it has faced on its pe­riph­ery.</p>
    <p>The US Sev­enth Fleet is a con­stant ir­ri­tant in the South China Sea, where it con­sis­tently car­ries out free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion and over­flight ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>A re­port in Au­gust by Pek­ing University think-tank South</p>
    <p>China Sea Strate­gic Sit­u­a­tion Prob­ing Ini­tia­tive (SCSPI) said US mil­i­tary air­craft – mostly spy planes – have made more than 1,500 flights over the dis­puted</p>
    <p>South China Sea each year, or an av­er­age of three to five a day, since 2009.</p>
    <p>The pres­ence of the US</p>
    <p>Navy’s sur­face ships in the</p>
    <p>South China Sea has also risen by more than 60 per cent to about 1,000 voy­ages a year in the past decade, said</p>
    <p>SCSPI.</p>
    <p>But it is on the is­sue of Tai­wan that Washington has inched per­ilously close to Bei­jing’s red line.</p>
    <p>This year, the US up­graded re­la­tions with the is­land, which Bei­jing views as a rene­gade prov­ince, and last month ap­proved the lat­est tranche of US$1.8 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion) worth of arms sales to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The ten­sions have put Bei­jing on high alert – me­dia reports last month said the main­land had moved ad­vanced hy­per­sonic mis­siles to lo­ca­tions near the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>Since late Au­gust, weapons fac­to­ries have also been told to put in over­time and ramp up pro­duc­tion of mu­ni­tions be­cause of cross-strait ten­sions, ac­cord­ing to a source at a state-owned weapons firm.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, on China’s west­ern bor­der, the PLA saw its dead­li­est clash in decades with In­dia in the Hi­malayas. “On all fronts, it’s a re­flec­tion of the uptick in se­cu­rity con­cerns for China across the board,” said mil­i­tary an­a­lyst Alexan­der Neill who runs a strate­gic ad­vi­sory con­sul­tancy in Sin­ga­pore, adding that there seems to be gen­uine con­cern for the PLA to be able to pre­vail should any fu­ture con­flict arise.</p>
    <p>MOD­ERN FIGHT­ING FORCE</p>
    <p>Such a “world-class” PLA that can fight and win wars is part of Mr Xi’s vi­sion to build a pow­er­ful China by 2049.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi, who as chair of the Cen­tral Mil­i­tary Com­mis­sion is China’s com­man­der-in-chief, said as much in a speech last month: “With­out a strong army, there can be no strong home­land.”</p>
    <p>The PLA has come a long way since its be­gin­nings in 1927 as a guerilla army of work­ers and peas­ants dur­ing the civil war be­tween the Com­mu­nist Party and Kuom­intang forces.</p>
    <p>Since Mr Xi came to power in 2012, he has ag­gres­sively rooted out cor­rup­tion, slashed some 300,000 sol­diers from its ranks, and com­pletely over­hauled how the PLA is or­gan­ised.</p>
    <p>Today’s PLA is a leaner and meaner fight­ing force, num­ber­ing some two mil­lion sol­diers – a far cry from Mao’s days when it was a foot sol­dier-heavy force with the army as its most im­por­tant com­po­nent.</p>
    <p>In its place is an emerg­ing blue-wa­ter navy – the big­gest fleet in the world in terms of sheer numbers – a grow­ing air force, rocket force and strate­gic sup­port force re­spon­si­ble for cy­ber war­fare and space op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>De­spite the progress, a de­fence pol­icy White Pa­per re­leased by Bei­jing last year pro­vided a can­did as­sess­ment of where China’s armed forces cur­rently stand: “PLA still lags far be­hind the world’s lead­ing mil­i­taries.” Among other things, it said, the PLA still needed to im­prove its in­for­ma­tion sys­tems and close the tech­no­log­i­cal gap with other armed forces.</p>
    <p>While plenum doc­u­ments are silent on the specifics of the 2027 tar­get, Shang­hai-based mil­i­tary an­a­lyst Ni Lex­iong said it sig­nals in no un­cer­tain terms the ur­gency of the task. “It says that China’s mil­i­tary mod­erni­sa­tion must not be stopped, it must over­come all dif­fi­cul­ties un­der cur­rent cir­cum­stances,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some mil­i­tary ex­perts see the new, tighter dead­line set by the plenum – shift­ing it for­ward by eight years – as a re­flec­tion of the party lead­er­ship’s grow­ing wor­ries about geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions. By that time, the PLA must have the abil­ity to deal with threats, both in the west­ern Pa­cific and along the bor­der with In­dia, they say.</p>
    <p>In the last few years, Bei­jing has de­vel­oped mod­ern weapons and plat­forms in­clud­ing hy­per­sonic mis­sile DF-17, the J-20 stealth fighter and its home-grown air­craft car­rier Type 001A.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the PLA Navy has been build­ing new ships at an “im­pres­sive rate”, the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies’ China Power Project said in a note.</p>
    <p>“Be­tween 2014 and 2018, China launched more sub­marines, war­ships, am­phibi­ous ves­sels and aux­il­iaries than the num­ber of ships cur­rently serv­ing in the in­di­vid­ual navies of Ger­many, In­dia, Spain and the United King­dom,” it said.</p>
    <p>While China has made im­pres­sive progress in rolling out new weaponry and plat­forms, it faces a “huge chal­lenge in de­vel­op­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties through re­al­is­tic train­ing, and at­tract­ing and re­tain­ing the right tal­ent”, said Mr Neill.</p>
    <p>RIS­ING RISKS</p>
    <p>One of Bei­jing’s pri­mary goals is to build up a com­bat-ready force that can best ad­ver­saries such as the US in po­ten­tial con­flicts over the South China Sea or Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>To do so, ex­perts ex­pect Chi­nese mil­i­tary spend­ing to ramp up from next year, de­spite it dip­ping this year to its low­est per­cent­age in­crease in decades.</p>
    <p>But a more mus­cu­lar China will also cre­ate anx­i­eties among its neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, Tokyo last year iden­ti­fied China as the coun­try’s great­est na­tional se­cu­rity threat, and plans to boost de­fence spend­ing in the face of China’s mil­i­tary mod­erni­sa­tion and buy Amer­i­can weapons.</p>
    <p>In July, Washington ap­proved the sale of 105 F-35 stealth fight­ers to Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Dr Koh pointed out that China’s pe­riph­eral coun­tries, such as Ja­pan, South Korea, In­dia and the South-east Asian na­tions, would likely re­spond in kind and arm them­selves.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to also see them re­in­forc­ing their al­liances and se­cu­rity part­ner­ships as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>Washington has a num­ber of treaty al­lies in the Pa­cific – in­clud­ing Ja­pan, South Korea, the Philip­pines and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>With Tai­wan, Washington’s Tai­wan Re­la­tions Act com­mits the US to the is­land’s se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>And therein lies Bei­jing’s dilemma.</p>
    <p>“De­vel­op­ing mil­i­tary strength quickly, cou­pled with the cur­rent stri­dent style of China’s for­eign pol­icy, will cause oth­ers to be­come fear­ful and hope for a greater US pres­ence,” said Mr Ni.</p>
    <p>“This is the re­verse of what</p>
    <p>China wants, but not mod­ernising the mil­i­tary is also not an op­tion.”</p>
    <p>A more mil­i­tarised re­gion also in­creases the like­li­hood of close en­coun­ters among var­i­ous forces op­er­at­ing in the South China Sea, East China Sea and along China’s land bor­ders.</p>
    <p>A key worry among mil­i­tary ob­servers is that a low-level clash could es­ca­late out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>There have been close calls in the past – such as the Gal­wan Val­ley clash this year, and the Hainan is­land in­ci­dent of 2001 where a US EP-3 sur­veil­lance plane col­lided with a Chi­nese F-8 fighter.</p>
    <p>Mr Neill pointed out that un­like the US, whose forces are bat­tle-tested, the PLA lacks com­bat ex­pe­ri­ence, and its ca­pa­bil­i­ties to man­age and re­spond to un­ex­pected crises are un­known.</p>
    <p>And with re­la­tions be­tween the two su­per­pow­ers ex­pected to be tense for years to come, the fear is that such a spark could ig­nite a larger con­fla­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>The west­ern Pa­cific is a po­ten­tial tin­der­box and for coun­tries in the re­gion, this should be a se­ri­ous cause for con­cern.</p>
