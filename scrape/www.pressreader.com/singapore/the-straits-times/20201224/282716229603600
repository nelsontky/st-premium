    <p>• Ja­panese ac­tor Yusuke Iseya has been sen­tenced to one year in jail, with the sen­tence sus­pended for three years, on Tues­day for il­le­gal drug pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Iseya, 44, was ar­rested by the Ja­panese po­lice in Septem­ber af­ter he was found with four packs of cannabis weigh­ing a to­tal of 13.17g at his home in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor had pleaded guilty to his charge dur­ing his trial ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>His lawyers said he used the drug to re­lieve stress and had been us­ing it more fre­quently as he had been spend­ing more time at home due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Ky­odo News re­ported.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors sought a oneyear jail term as they said Iseya had been a reg­u­lar drug user since he was 26 or 27 years old.</p>
    <p>Pre­sid­ing judge Chikako Mu­rata said in the rul­ing on Tues­day that the amount of drugs found in Iseya’s pos­ses­sion was too much for his own con­sump­tion, but she gave him a sus­pended jail sen­tence af­ter he promised not to take the drug again.</p>
    <p>Iseya said in a state­ment af­ter the sen­tence that he ac­cepted the court judg­ment and apol­o­gised for dis­ap­point­ing his friends and fans who have been sup­port­ing him.</p>
    <p>Iseya is the half-brother of fash­ion de­signer Kan­sai Ya­mamoto, who died at the age of 76 in July.</p>
    <p>Iseya rose to promi­nence af­ter act­ing in di­rec­tor Hirokazu Koreeda’s 1998 film Af­ter Life and has also acted in other movies such as the Rurouni Ken­shin films (2014) and the ac­claimed Fly Me To The Saitama (2019).</p>
    <p>He re­cently played a po­lice academy in­struc­tor in the tele­vi­sion se­ries De­tec­tive Novice (2020).</p>
