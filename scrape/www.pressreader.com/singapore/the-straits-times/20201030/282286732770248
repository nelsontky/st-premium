    <p>The Na­tional Kid­ney Foun­da­tion (NKF) has re­struc­tured the work at its dial­y­sis cen­tres such that it could re­duce its need for nurses by more than 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>It re­cruited its first dial­y­sis care as­so­ciate in June to take over non­clin­i­cal tasks, such as pre­par­ing the ma­chines and get­ting the tubes, saline and other con­sum­ables ready for each pa­tient.</p>
    <p>It now has 14 and is look­ing to hire 70 more by the mid­dle of next year. By 2023, it hopes to have 230 of them. This should re­duce the num­ber of nurses needed by about 200 – by re­duc­ing the nurse to pa­tient ra­tio from one to four, to one to seven. It cur­rently has 762 nurses at its 38 dial­y­sis cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion is not plan­ning to let go of any of its nurs­ing staff, since it will need them for new dial­y­sis cen­tres open­ing up in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>It opened eight in the past four years, and will have three more cen­tres by 2023.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, about one in three of the 42,700 nurses is for­eign, with more than half from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The nurses at the dial­y­sis cen­tres now not only look after the pa­tients, they also have to en­sure that the ma­chines are cleaned and work­ing cor­rectly.</p>
    <p>But NKF chief ex­ec­u­tive Tim Oei wants to change this to al­low nurses to con­cen­trate on clin­i­cal work.</p>
    <p>He said: “The dial­y­sis care as­so­ci­ates will help off­load our nurses of their non-clin­i­cal du­ties, so that they can spend more qual­ity time with pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“Apart from be­ing lo­cal and well fa­mil­iar with the lo­cal so­cial and cul­tural norms, some (as­so­ci­ates) can speak di­alects, which helps them to re­late to pa­tients bet­ter and en­gage them in a more ef­fec­tive way.”</p>
    <p>The change will help to lower the wage cost for the not-for-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion, as as­so­ci­ates, who re­quire sec­ondary school qual­i­fi­ca­tion, are paid less than nurses.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals and other health­care in­sti­tutes, also con­cerned about the short­age of nurses, have been stream­lin­ing or em­ploy­ing tech­nol­ogy to raise nurs­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal (SGH), for ex­am­ple, has been train­ing care sup­port as­so­ci­ates since 2018 to draw blood, do sim­ple wound dress­ing and ban­dag­ing, and na­so­gas­tric tube feed­ing. It now has 140 of them.</p>
    <p>An SGH spokesman said: “This has al­lowed our nurses to at­tend to the more com­plex needs of our pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>NKF dial­y­sis care as­so­ciate Uma Rani, 34, started work­ing at the dial­y­sis cen­tre in Yishun in June.</p>
    <p>A for­mer health­care as­sis­tant in ra­di­ol­ogy in the pri­vate sec­tor, she sani­tises the chairs and pre­pares the ma­chines, in­clud­ing set­ting up the blood lines, be­fore pa­tients ar­rive.</p>
    <p>Trained nurses are needed to insert the two nee­dles and fix the blood lines to the pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Nurses are also the only ones qual­i­fied to ad­min­is­ter any medicine that pa­tients may need.</p>
    <p>While the pa­tients are on dial­y­sis, Ms Rani pre­pares the con­sum­ables, such as wipes and saline so­lu­tion, for the next batch of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>She also gets drinks for pa­tients, chats with them in English, Malay or Tamil, and helps with the arm and leg ex­er­cises they are en­cour­aged to do while sit­ting in their chairs dur­ing the four-hour dial­y­sis ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Oei said the job re­struc­tur­ing “may be small changes, but they will im­prove our staff’s qual­ity of work and care to pa­tients sub­stan­tially, lead­ing to higher job sat­is­fac­tion”.</p>
