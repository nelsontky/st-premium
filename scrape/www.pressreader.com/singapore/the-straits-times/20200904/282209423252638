    <p>For the sev­enth con­sec­u­tive year, Sin­ga­pore has re­tained the top spot as Asia-Pa­cific’s most in­no­va­tive na­tion in the lat­est Global In­no­va­tion In­dex.</p>
    <p>The an­nual in­dex – re­leased by the World In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Or­gan­i­sa­tion, Cor­nell Univer­sity and Insead – ranks 131 economies ac­cord­ing to their ca­pac­ity for, and suc­cess in, in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The rank­ing is based on 80 in­di­ca­tors, such as mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion cre­ation and ease of start­ing a busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In­di­ca­tors fall into “in­put” or “out­put” cat­e­gories. In­put refers to the el­e­ments of a na­tional econ­omy that en­able in­no­va­tive ac­tiv­i­ties, and out­put refers to the re­sults of the in­no­va­tive ac­tiv­i­ties of economies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore fared well in tra­di­tion­ally strong in­put in­di­ca­tors such as po­lit­i­cal and op­er­a­tional sta­bil­ity, govern­ment ef­fec­tive­ness and ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion – rank­ing No. 1 glob­ally for all of them.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also im­proved in in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty (IP)-re­lated out­put in­di­ca­tors that mea­sure ease of patent fil­ing and pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Of­fice of Sin­ga­pore (Ipos) chief ex­ec­u­tive Rena</p>
    <p>Lee said yes­ter­day: “Ipos’ dig­i­tal ef­forts, which are part of the na­tional dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion road map, have been ac­cel­er­ated by Covid-19 and con­tinue to bol­ster our po­si­tion as an in­no­va­tion hub.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides be­ing fully dig­i­tal for all of its IP ap­pli­ca­tion ser­vices since 2014, Ipos has en­hanced its mo­bile app for trade­mark ap­pli­ca­tions and con­ducted fully vir­tual IP dis­pute hear­ings, among other things, she added.</p>
    <p>“Ipos is con­tin­u­ously in­no­vat­ing to give en­ter­prises a busi­ness edge dur­ing the pan­demic where time is of the essence,” she said.</p>
    <p>In the over­all global rank­ing of the in­no­va­tion in­dex, Sin­ga­pore is in eighth place, with the top three po­si­tions go­ing to Switzer­land, Swe­den and the United States.</p>
    <p>But the Re­pub­lic per­formed rel­a­tively poorly in out­put in­di­ca­tors such as na­tional fea­ture films (No. 61) and in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy ser­vices ex­ports (No. 50).</p>
    <p>Dr Bruno Lan­vin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for global indices at Insead and co-ed­i­tor of the in­dex, told The Straits Times: “A coun­try that has a bet­ter per­for­mance on in­put than on out­put is ba­si­cally a coun­try that does not re­ceive the re­ward that its ef­forts would de­serve.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the im­bal­anced per­for­mance, which has per­sisted over a few years, the city-state has main­tained “great sta­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also did poorly in the in­di­ca­tor for ex­pen­di­ture on ed­u­ca­tion as a pro­por­tion of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. Dr Lan­vin said that while this is an im­por­tant in­di­ca­tor for many coun­tries as it tracks the “po­lit­i­cal will of gov­ern­ments to make ed­u­ca­tion a pri­or­ity”, it may not ap­ply to the Re­pub­lic.</p>
    <p>He said: “In the case of Sin­ga­pore, as in the case of Switzer­land, it is a bit mis­lead­ing, since a well-run ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem may not re­quire a higher level of pub­lic ex­pen­di­ture.”</p>
