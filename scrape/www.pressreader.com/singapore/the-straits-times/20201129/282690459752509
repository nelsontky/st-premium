    <p>The rust is set­tling in, the com­pet­i­tive spirit is los­ing some bite and frus­tra­tion is set­ting in on Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ing pro­fes­sional golfers.</p>
    <p>And while the Repub­lic’s tour­ing pro­fes­sion­als keep them­selves busy with mu­tual chal­lenges and so­cial rounds with spon­sors, they miss the big ri­valry and top-level at­mos­phere that prime them for in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>After al­most 10 months of competitio­n in­ac­tiv­ity, thanks to a “god­fa­ther”, the pro­fes­sion­als will see top-class ac­tion again when they com­pete in the FTAG In­vi­ta­tional on Dec 17 and 18 at a venue to be de­cided soon.</p>
    <p>Kelvin Chng, founder and ad­viser of FTAG Fin­tech Al­liance Global, a Sin­ga­pore-based global ven­ture cap­i­tal, in­cu­ba­tor and ac­cel­er­a­tor and a fully in­de­pen­dent ser­vice provider, is cough­ing up money from his com­pany to help the pro­fes­sion­als gear them­selves up for the</p>
    <p>up­com­ing tour­na­ments — namely Asian Tour events — slated for next year.</p>
    <p>Said Chng, 42, who with busi­ness part­ner James Koh co-owns watch com­pany Chrono95, is also con­sid­er­ing other projects to help the play­ing pro­fes­sion­als, said: “I have heard of the plight of lo­cal pros from one among them, Peter Ang. The Covid-19 pan­demic has hit them</p>
    <p>badly not only with zero com­pe­ti­tions, but also con­se­quently hurt their pock­ets.</p>
    <p>“Many of them have fam­i­lies, and some have gone into part-time teach­ing to sup­ple­ment their in­come. This in­vi­ta­tional event is a start to help them with some pocket money to meet the ex­penses for for­eign events slated for next year.”</p>
    <p>Ang, 32, has been a pro­fes­sional for 14 years and, un­til early this year, was teach­ing at Ma­rina Bay Golf and Coun­try Club. Now he is a di­rec­tor of a com­pany deal­ing in di­a­monds and lux­ury goods.</p>
    <p>The mem­ber of Tanah Merah, La­guna Na­tional and War­ren plays reg­u­larly with the lead­ing lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als and he un­der­stands their plight. He also coaches Chng and has con­vinced him to look into ways to help the pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>He is help­ing Chng to or­gan­ise the two-day event with a guar­an­teed ap­pear­ance fee of $1,000 for each pro­fes­sional. The win­ner and run­ner-up of the event will also re­ceive prize-money, the sum has yet to be de­cided.</p>
    <p>Added Chng, a keen foot­ball and bas­ket­ball fan and a 21-hand­i­cap­per who took up golf two years ago, “I know that it is a small start. But I be­lieve it is a big in­cen­tive for the pros.”</p>
    <p>The ar­dent sup­porter of Liver­pool and Los An­ge­les Lak­ers sports teams added that he be­lieved that golf is one sport in which Sin­ga­pore­ans can ex­cel. “But they need some mone­tary back­ing to help them pay for the travel and ac­com­mo­da­tion ex­penses when­ever they com­pete abroad.</p>
    <p>“I hope this ges­ture will en­cour­age other spon­sors to also step for­ward to help our pros, some of whom with no club mem­ber­ship can­not even play reg­u­larly on a course.”</p>
    <p>In a plea to other com­pa­nies to step for­ward to help golf, and sport in gen­eral, Chng added: “We be­lieve en­trepreneur­s bring on the pos­i­tive, trans­for­ma­tional change across every as­pect of our so­ci­ety and econ­omy. And it is no dif­fer­ent in sport.”</p>
    <p>In March this year, Chrono95 came for­ward to help pro­fes­sion­als Choo Tze Huang and Koh Deng­shan with spon­sor­ship to cover ex­penses for their travel to in­ter­na­tional events, also with a re­tainer.</p>
