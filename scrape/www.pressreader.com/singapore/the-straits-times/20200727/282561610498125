    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • New York-born ac­tor and direc­tor Mel Gibson was hos­pi­talised in April af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for the coronaviru­s but has since re­cov­ered, his rep­re­sen­ta­tive said last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Gibson, 64, spent a week in a Cal­i­for­nia hospi­tal, the rep­re­sen­ta­tive said. He was treated with remde­sivir, the first drug shown to be ef­fec­tive against the virus, and has since tested neg­a­tive sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor joined a lengthy list of celebri­ties, politi­cians, sports stars and other well-known fig­ures, in­clud­ing ac­tors Tom Hanks and Rita Wil­son, to re­veal their own strug­gles with the virus, which has in­fected more than four mil­lion Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Gibson is per­haps best known for his 1995 film Brave­heart, for which he won a pair of Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Direc­tor. He fell out of favour in Hol­ly­wood in the early 2000s for his drunken an­tiSemitic and misog­y­nis­tic rants.</p>
    <p>In 2006, Gibson apol­o­gised for what he de­scribed as “de­spi­ca­ble” re­marks he had made when he was ar­rested on a drink-driv­ing charge.</p>
    <p>He has pulled off some­thing of a come­back in Hol­ly­wood af­ter ex­press­ing re­pen­tance for his past be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>In 2017, he landed six Os­car nom­i­na­tions, in­clud­ing for Best Direc­tor, for Hack­saw Ridge, a World War II fea­ture he di­rected. He said in 2016 that he had been sober for 10 years.</p>
    <p>But his his­tory of of­fen­sive com­ments resur­faced last month, when ac­tress Wi­nona Ry­der told The Sun­day Times of Lon­don that he had made big­oted re­marks at her at a party more than a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Gibson’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­nied that he had made the com­ments.</p>
