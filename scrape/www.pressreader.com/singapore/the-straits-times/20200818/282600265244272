    <p>PARIS • Former French pres­i­dent Ni­co­las Sarkozy’s “love story” mem­oir has topped the coun­try’s best­sellers list for a third straight week, ac­cord­ing to the rank­ings last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Time Of Storms re­counts the first two dra­matic years of his pres­i­dency, when his wife Ce­cilia left him and he mar­ried singer and former model Carla Bruni af­ter a whirl­wind ro­mance.</p>
    <p>Mr Sarkozy served as French Pres­i­dent be­tween 2007 and 2012.</p>
    <p>The book is far ahead of a bevy of nov­els for the beach by some of the coun­try’s lead­ing au­thors, ac­cord­ing to the GfK/Livres Hebdo rank­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Sarkozy’s publisher says that nearly a quar­ter of a mil­lion copies of the mem­oir had been sold so far and an­other re­print was on the way.</p>
    <p>De­spite his fail­ure to re­vive his po­lit­i­cal ca­reer af­ter his de­feat by so­cial­ist Fran­cois Hol­lande in 2012, Mr Sarkozy – and par­tic­u­larly his pri­vate life – con­tinue to fas­ci­nate the French.</p>
    <p>The new book also tells of how the mer­cu­rial leader had Mr Do­minique Strauss-Kahn, then seen as a pos­si­ble fu­ture ri­val for the El­y­see Palace, ap­pointed to head the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund.</p>
    <p>Mr Strauss-Kahn was forced to re­sign in 2011 af­ter he was ar­rested for the at­tempted rape of a ho­tel maid in New York. The charges were later dropped, but DSK, as the so­cial­ist politi­cian is known, set­tled a civil case with the woman, re­port­edly for US$1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Since then, Mr Sarkozy has been im­pli­cated in a se­ries of corruption and il­le­gal party-fund­ing scan­dals, in­clud­ing al­le­ga­tions he had Libyan dic­ta­tor Muam­mar Gaddafi help finance his suc­cess­ful 2007 pres­i­den­tial cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Months later, he brought Mr Gaddafi in from the diplo­matic cold, let­ting him pitch his Be­douin tent op­po­site the El­y­see on a state visit to France.</p>
    <p>But in 2011, Mr Sarkozy was the driv­ing force be­hind the in­ter­na­tional mil­i­tary in­ven­tion that top­pled Mr Gaddafi, who was killed by rebel fight­ers in Oc­to­ber that year.</p>
    <p>Come Oc­to­ber, Mr Sarkozy, 65, will be­come France’s first ex-pres­i­dent to stand trial for al­leged crimes while in of­fice, in a case in which he is ac­cused of try­ing to ob­tain clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion from a judge.</p>
    <p>An­other trial on the al­leged il­le­gal fi­nanc­ing of his 2012 cam­paign could also start later this year.</p>
    <p>Yet the French pub­lic can­not get enough of Mr Sarkozy’s lit­er­ary out­put, with his “book on life”, Pas­sions, shift­ing 200,000 copies last year, the kind of num­bers that only cel­e­brated nov­el­ists are ca­pa­ble of sell­ing.</p>
    <p>In­deed, since 1994, Mr Sarkozy has au­thored nearly a dozen tomes of var­i­ous kinds, with his book Tes­ti­mony in 2006, the year be­fore he was elected pres­i­dent, sell­ing about 350,000 copies.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter what new charges and scan­dals he faces, his book sign­ings al­ways see loyal fans turn­ing out in force.</p>
