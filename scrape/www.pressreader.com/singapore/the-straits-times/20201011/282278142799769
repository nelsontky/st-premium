    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial?</p>
    <p>More than just a ho­tel, Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) is where I es­cape to to live my best In­sta­gram-wor­thy Crazy Rich Asians life.</p>
    <p>No need to ven­ture out for din­ing or shop­ping. A ki­asu pre-stay­cay strat­egy helps me make the most of my one-night stay.</p>
    <p>This means pre-book­ing meals at the big-name restau­rants and snag­ging pre­cious one-hour slots at the In­fin­ity Pool – I go post-din­ner and be­fore break­fast for stun­ning night and day views.</p>
    <p>One hour per room per day – due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions – at the iconic 150m-long pool may seem short, but it is suf­fi­cient for a photo ses­sion with the In­stahus­band. Dur­ing peak hours, the pool can have no more than 150 peo­ple – a far cry from pre-Covid-19 num­bers of up to 500 peo­ple at any one point – which means min­i­mal pho­to­bombers in the shots.</p>
    <p>Pro tip: Book your slot upon reser­va­tion of the room.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel’s bathrobe and slip­pers are fine for pool time but, gen­er­ally, the crowd – es­pe­cially din­ers at the fancy restau­rants – is dressed to the nines. So ditch the slovenly work­from-home shorts and T-shirts and pack your shini­est out­fits and shoes. You will never be over­dressed.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>It is reassuring to see the SG Cleancer­ti­fied in­te­grated re­sort take clean­ing and safe dis­tanc­ing very se­ri­ously. Al­co­hol-free hand sani­tiser dis­pensers are in­stalled in ev­ery lift. Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors are al­ways on pa­trol and quick to split big groups apart – es­pe­cially at the check-in area.</p>
    <p>Once the one-hour pool time is up, life­guards promptly wave ev­ery­one out be­fore clean­ing starts.</p>
    <p>In the rooms, all tow­els and bathrobes – as well as the tele­vi­sion re­mote con­trols – are in­di­vid­u­ally wrapped in plas­tic. In a pri­vate tour of the premises, I am shown the elec­tro­static spray used for the deep clean­ing of ho­tel rooms, along with other hos­pi­tal-grade dis­in­fec­tants.</p>
    <p>At Rise res­tau­rant, my break­fast set – served a la carte in­stead of the usual buf­fet style – comes cov­ered with a cloche. You can still ob­serve chefs cook­ing at the live sta­tions, but with acrylic shields in place.</p>
    <p>Things that made you go “yum”?</p>
    <p>At Ital­ian-Amer­i­can res­tau­rant Lavo, I start my feast with the all­time favourite meat­ball made with one pound of wagyu, veal and Ital­ian sausage. I save some space for the sin­ful 20-layer choco­late and peanut but­ter cake but end up pack­ing most of it home – it lasts me another five days.</p>
    <p>For lunch, my lips tin­gle with plea­sure at Chi­nese res­tau­rant Mott 32’s hot and sour Shang­hainese soup dumplings and the poached garoupa fil­let in a de­li­ciously spicy Sichuan pep­per broth.</p>
    <p>Even if you are not stump­ing out to stay at the ho­tel, you can go for well-priced set lunches at its sig­na­ture restau­rants. High­lights from Spago’s l unch menu ($49++ for three cour­ses) in­clude its sig­na­ture big eye tuna tartare cones, ag­nolotti with porcini mush­rooms, grilled An­gus beef burger and grilled Iberico pork pressa.</p>
    <p>Sip on The In­fin­ity cock­tail at the neigh­bour­ing Spago Bar & Lounge, made with Lap­sang Sou­chong teain­fused Bulleit Bour­bon 10 Year, pineap­ple juice and le­mon. It is part of MBS’ 10 Years Of Mixol­ogy cock­tail se­ries to mark the in­te­grated re­sort’s 10th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>Over at Ja­panese res­tau­rant Koma, go for the three-course lunch ($49++, cur­rently 11.30am to 3pm on week­days; Wed­nes­days to Sun­days from Oct 28) as the desserts – Le­mon Yuzu, Bon­sai and Ja­panese cheese­cake – are not to be missed. All three are pic­tureper­fect against the back­drop of the 2.5m-tall bell and Ja­panese bridge.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Go on the new 75-minute Sus­tain­abil­ity & Art guided tour, part of a stay­ca­tion pack­age (from $840 nett for a two-night stay) launch­ing in the com­ing weeks. It in­cludes a pair of tick­ets to the ArtS­cience Mu­seum’s Planet Or Plas­tic? ex­hi­bi­tion and $50 din­ing credit.</p>
    <p>I get a pre­view of the in­for­ma­tive tour, which high­lights el­e­ments such as the Wind Ar­bor art in­stal­la­tion by Amer­i­can artist Ned Kahn and the ed­i­ble herb gar­den at Rise res­tau­rant. At the end, chil­dren get a beau­ti­fully de­signed ac­tiv­ity book on sus­tain­abil­ity, com­plete with a pop-up model of MBS.</p>
    <p>Why sleep in when you can get an early start to the day, right?</p>
    <p>I wake up early for the first pool slot at 6.30am and am re­warded with a lovely sun­rise. One can also go for a leisurely stroll around the Ma­rina Bay area or Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Bliss or Miss?</p>
    <p>Ev­ery an­gle of MBS – de­signed by ac­claimed Is­raeli-Cana­dian architect Moshe Safdie – is made for the gram. Although I’m in work mode, I snap plenty of panoramic shots, self­ies and #food­porn – the way I would on a hol­i­day over­seas.</p>
    <p>No ef­fort is spared to make this city stay­cay feel like a quick get­away, even if you are on the “worka­tion” pack­age (from $329 a night, Mon­days to Thurs­days till Dec 23). Perks in­clude early check-in at 9am (sub­ject to room avail­abil­ity) and $50 in-room din­ing credit. A box of mac­arons sent to my room sweet­ens the deal.</p>
    <p>HOT TIP</p>
    <p>Avoid the week­end crowd and go for an off-peak stay from Mon­days to Thurs­days. There is less has­sle book­ing pool slots and meals, and rates for spa treat­ments and ser­vices at the Banyan Tree Spa are also slightly cheaper.</p>
