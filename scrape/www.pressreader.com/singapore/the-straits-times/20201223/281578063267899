    <p>A court bat­tle between the chil­dren of the man who founded Eng’s won­ton noo­dles and a busi­ness part­ner fiz­zled out yes­ter­day, with each side los­ing its claims against the other. But with a trade­mark dis­pute still be­fore the court, the war over the won­ton mee busi­ness is far from over.</p>
    <p>A court fight between the chil­dren of the man who founded Eng’s won­ton noo­dles and a busi­ness part­ner fiz­zled out yes­ter­day, with each side los­ing its claims against the other.</p>
    <p>But with a trade­mark dis­pute still be­fore the court, the bat­tle over the won­ton mee busi­ness, which is known for its springy noo­dles and “gun­pow­der” chilli paste, is far from over.</p>
    <p>The le­gal tus­sles arose from a joint ven­ture between Mr Des­mond Ng, 51 – the son of the late Mr Ng Ba Eng, who ran a suc­cess­ful hawker stall at Dun­man Food Cen­tre – and Ms Pauline New, 52.</p>
    <p>In 2012, the stall moved to a shop called Eng’s Noo­dles House at 287 Tan­jong Ka­tong Road, af­ter Ms New’s hus­band in­vested $150,000 to ex­pand the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>A com­pany of the same name was reg­is­tered, with the younger Mr Ng and Ms New as di­rec­tors and share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The el­der Mr Ng died in 2013. In 2018, af­ter a fall­ing-out between the part­ners, the com­pany failed to re­new the lease on the premises. It ceased busi­ness on Feb 28, 2018.</p>
    <p>On the same day, a new com­pany called Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle was set up and took over the premises. The new lease was re­port­edly signed by Mr Thomas Hong, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of soup chain Lao Huo Tang.</p>
    <p>On March 5, 2018, Mr Des­mond Ng’s sis­ters Mui Hong, 52, and Mei Ling, 48, set up a com­pany called Eng’s Char Siew Wan­tan Mee. They set up shop at 248 Tan­jong</p>
    <p>Ka­tong Road, doors away from Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle.</p>
    <p>Last year, Ms New sued the three sib­lings and Mr Bill Teng, who han­dled the ac­counts of the de­funct Eng’s Noo­dles House and was al­lot­ted a 5 per cent stake in the com­pany.</p>
    <p>She ac­cused the de­fen­dants of con­spir­ing to harm Eng’s Noo­dles House by set­ting up a com­pet­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Among other things, she pointed to the fact that Ms Ng Mui Hong had reg­is­tered a trade­mark on Oct 3, 2017, com­pris­ing the word “Eng’s”, the Chi­nese char­ac­ters for the brand, and a chilli logo. Ms New al­leged that this was to pre­pare for the “usurp­ing”.</p>
    <p>Ms New also al­leged that Mr Ng and Mr Teng had breached their fidu­ciary du­ties to Eng’s Noo­dles House. She ac­cused Mr Teng of mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing com­pany funds, but dropped the claim dur­ing the trial.</p>
    <p>The Ng sis­ters coun­ter­claimed against Ms New for “pass­ing off”, al­leg­ing that she and her hus­band, busi­ness­man Ja­son Sim, had “stolen the fam­ily busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>The sis­ters con­tended that Ms New and Mr Sim had helped set up Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle, which has since ex­panded to mul­ti­ple fran­chise out­lets across the is­land.</p>
    <p>A Straits Times check showed that the com­pany is owned by a 27-year-old in­di­vid­ual named Eng Ye Yeng.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment yes­ter­day, High Court judge Va­lerie Thean dis­missed Ms New’s claims that the de­fen­dants had con­spired to harm Eng’s Noo­dles House.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Thean found that Ms Ng Mui Hong, who knew of the sour­ing re­la­tion­ship, was tak­ing pre­emp­tive steps to pro­tect the brand when she reg­is­tered the trade­mark.</p>
    <p>The judge found that the sis­ters set­ting up shop at 248 was not a pre­med­i­tated plan, but a “hasty” move to as­sert their “orig­i­nal” brand in re­ac­tion to Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle tak­ing over at 287.</p>
    <p>The judge also found that Ms New and Mr Sim were in­stru­men­tal in the set­ting up of Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Thean re­jected the coun­ter­claim by the sis­ters that Ms New was mis­lead­ing con­sumers into be­liev­ing that Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle was ac­tu­ally the same as their fam­ily busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The judge said there was no doubt that dur­ing the years at Dun­man Food Cen­tre, the el­der Mr Ng was the owner of the good­will, or rep­u­ta­tion, at­tached to the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the judge said the sis­ters failed to es­tab­lish that the pub­lic at­trib­uted the good­will to other mem­bers of the fam­ily aside from the late Mr Ng or Mr Des­mond Ng, who had helped his father in the busi­ness since 2009.</p>
    <p>The judge added that the pass­ing off claim should have been brought against Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle.</p>
    <p>Mr Teng, through his lawyers Suresh Damodara and Cle­ment Ong, said he was re­lieved to be vin­di­cated in court.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment yes­ter­day, High Court judge Va­lerie Thean dis­missed Ms Pauline New’s claims that the de­fen­dants had con­spired to harm Eng’s Noo­dles House... The judge found that the Ng sis­ters set­ting up shop at 248 was not a pre­med­i­tated plan, but a “hasty” move to as­sert their “orig­i­nal” brand in re­ac­tion to Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle tak­ing over at 287.</p>
