    <p>Visi­tors from New Zealand and Brunei who suc­cess­fully ap­ply to come to Sin­ga­pore will be re­quired to use the TraceTo­gether app at all times while in the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>They must also re­tain the app for 14 con­sec­u­tive days af­ter leav­ing Sin­ga­pore, al­though there are no de­tails on how this will be en­forced.</p>
    <p>Should they test pos­i­tive dur­ing this pe­riod, they will be re­quired to up­load data stored on the app to the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) yes­ter­day spelt out the con­di­tions for travel here.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows an­nounce­ments last Friday of Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion to uni­lat­er­ally open up its bor­ders to Brunei and New Zealand, a move praised by avi­a­tion stake­hold­ers. But the im­pact is ex­pected to be very limited given that travel restric­tions are still in place in both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Visi­tors from the two coun­tries will need to only take a Covid-19 test upon ar­rival in­stead of hav­ing to serve a quar­an­tine pe­riod. How­ever, they will have to pay their own med­i­cal bills should they re­quire treat­ment for the coronaviru­s while in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In­ter­ested visi­tors from New Zealand and Brunei can ap­ply for an air travel pass (ATP) on­line from noon on Sept 1 for en­try into Sin­ga­pore on or af­ter Sept 8.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion must be done between seven and 30 cal­en­dar days prior to their in­tended date of en­try into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>CAAS said this pass will let the au­thor­i­ties con­tact in­ter­ested visi­tors should there be any changes to Sin­ga­pore’s health and bor­der mea­sures. It will also help to man­age the num­ber of in­com­ing visi­tors.</p>
    <p>Visi­tors must also have spent the last 14 days in Brunei or New Zealand be­fore fly­ing to Sin­ga­pore on di­rect flights with­out tran­sit.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, they will also have to take pri­vate trans­porta­tion, taxis or pri­vate-hire cars from the airport to a de­clared place of ac­com­mo­da­tion af­ter un­der­go­ing the Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test at the airport. They will have to re­main iso­lated at the ac­com­mo­da­tion un­til the test re­sult is out within 48 hours.</p>
    <p>To fa­cil­i­tate this process, visi­tors are strongly en­cour­aged to pre­book and pay the $300 fee for their Covid-19 test on­line, and re­fer to the Sin­ga­pore Ho­tel As­so­ci­a­tion web­site for the list of ho­tels where ac­com­mo­da­tion is avail­able.</p>
    <p>CAAS said even as it re­vives the Changi air hub in a safe way, a key pri­or­ity is the safety and well-be­ing of pas­sen­gers, air crew and airport staff, and public health in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It added that the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore may in­tro­duce new mea­sures or re­quire­ments as and when nec­es­sary to safe­guard public health, which may re­sult in changes to the con­di­tions or can­cel­la­tion of the ATP at short no­tice.</p>
    <p>The New Zealand gov­ern­ment con­tin­ues to ad­vise all its cit­i­zens not to travel over­seas, even as it ac­knowl­edged Sin­ga­pore’s de­ci­sion to open its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>New Zealan­ders who choose to travel over­seas will have to serve a quar­an­tine pe­riod of at least 14 days at a gov­ern­ment-pro­vided fa­cil­ity when they re­turn home.</p>
    <p>They are not al­lowed to self-iso­late or take a do­mes­tic flight be­fore the quar­an­tine is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Brunei gov­ern­ment has said that its cit­i­zens, per­ma­nent res­i­dents and long-term visa hold­ers are re­stricted from leav­ing Brunei.</p>
    <p>The only ex­cep­tions ap­ply to those un­der­go­ing ur­gent med­i­cal care over­seas, at­tend­ing court hear­ings or re­sum­ing study abroad.</p>
