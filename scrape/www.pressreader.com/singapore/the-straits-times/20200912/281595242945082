    <p>Can­di­dates for the Sabah state elec­tion will file their nom­i­na­tions to­day. The con­test on Sept 26 will not only elect who will gov­ern Malaysia’s east­ern­most state, but also test voter sup­port for the Perikatan Na­sional fed­eral gov­ern­ment and its ri­vals in op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates for Sabah’s 73 state seats will file their nom­i­na­tions to­day in what is a con­test not just for Malaysia’s east­ern­most state, but also for the le­git­i­macy of two lead­ing can­di­dates to gov­ern the coun­try in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin is se­cure as head of the sev­en­month-old Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment at least un­til he calls for ex­pected snap polls, where the op­po­si­tion could be led by in­cum­bent Sabah Chief Min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal.</p>
    <p>But who­ever is on the los­ing side of the bat­tle for Sabah will find his cred­i­bil­ity in seek­ing a full term as prime min­is­ter se­verely dented.</p>
    <p>“Par­ties want to know whether their PM can­di­date can ac­tu­ally de­liver votes, so Sabah is a dry run,” Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs se­nior fel­low Oh Ei Sun told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din, rid­ing on a wave of ap­proval over Kuala Lumpur’s han­dling of the virus out­break, has been forced into an early test of the co­he­sive­ness of his fledg­ling rul­ing pact af­ter Datuk Seri Shafie con­vinced the Sabah gov­er­nor, a cer­e­mo­nial head of state, to dis­solve the leg­is­la­ture when de­fec­tors de­prived his Parti Warisan Sabahled coali­tion of a ma­jor­ity in July.</p>
    <p>Mr Shafie has been nom­i­nated as a can­di­date for the premier­ship by most op­po­si­tion par­ties ex­cept Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR), which in­sists its pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim must as­cend to the high­est of­fice.</p>
    <p>A deal for Datuk Seri An­war to re­place former prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad was scup­pered when Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) was top­pled by de­fec­tions in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts be­lieve that re­sults of the Sabah elec­tion on Sept 26 will im­pact in­ter­nal dy­nam­ics in both op­po­si­tion and gov­ern­ment pacts.</p>
    <p>“A Warisan loss would em­bolden de­trac­tors in PH to ar­gue that Shafie would not be able to de­liver Malaysia if he can’t even de­liver his home state,” said Dr Oh.</p>
    <p>If Mr Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia and PN fail to de­liver in Sabah, he may lack lever­age to se­cure enough seats for his party at the gen­eral elec­tion and may find him­self un­able to re­sist Umno’s de­sire to wrest back the premier­ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has had to fight hard to re­tain his slim parliament­ary ma­jor­ity – 113 out of 222 MPs – amid jostling for lever­age by al­lies in the coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Umno, the largest party in gov­ern­ment, is re­fus­ing to join an of­fi­cially reg­is­tered PN, and wants to con­test as Barisan Na­sional (BN), the once dom­i­nant coali­tion it leads.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu and its al­lies will con­test the Sabah vote us­ing at least three dif­fer­ent flags, and have yet to agree on who would be chief min­is­ter should they emerge vic­to­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty cloud­ing the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion has pushed rul­ing par­ties to call for fresh polls ex­pected by early next year, while the premier him­self has also de­clared to his party that he wants to claim a strong per­sonal man­date.</p>
    <p>Na­tional opin­ion polls had the prime min­is­ter’s ap­proval at 69 per cent last month, while the So­ci­ety Em­pow­er­ment and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment of Sabah (Seeds) think­tank found in its sur­vey two weeks ago that nine of 10 peo­ple in the state</p>
    <p>were sat­is­fied with his per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, nearly 40 per cent of Saba­hans pick Mr Shafie as the best chief min­is­ter can­di­date, more than the three like­li­est choices from Umno and Ber­satu re­ceived com­bined, the Seeds sur­vey showed. But only 54 per cent ap­proved of the Warisan state gov­ern­ment, as com­pared with the 82 per cent for PN at fed­eral level.</p>
    <p>“Shafie has cer­tain qual­i­ties – (he is) a good speaker, down to earth,</p>
    <p>so peo­ple like his per­son­al­ity. But when it comes to gov­ern­ing, peo­ple are not so happy,” Seeds chair­man Arnold Puyok told ST. “If PN talks about how they are go­ing to fix Sabah’s econ­omy, they will stand a good chance.”</p>
    <p>A top Warisan leader told ST: “It is a proxy bat­tle be­tween Shafie and Muhyid­din. This may ex­plain why An­war de­cided to launch PKR’s own elec­tion ma­chin­ery last week­end in­stead of en­dors­ing our pres­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>The so-called Warisan Plus cam­paign led by Mr Shafie was launched si­mul­ta­ne­ously and in­cluded the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party and Parti Amanah Ne­gara – com­po­nents of the An­war-led PH coali­tion – as well as lo­cal party United Pro­gres­sive Kinabalu Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
