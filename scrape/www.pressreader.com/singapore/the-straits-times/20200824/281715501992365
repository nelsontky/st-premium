    <p>A new clus­ter in a dor­mi­tory in Kaki Bukit was an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One of the newly con­firmed Covid-19 cases was linked to four pre­vi­ously con­firmed cases to form a new clus­ter at Homes­tay Lodge at 39 Kaki Bukit Av­enue 3.</p>
    <p>It was among the 73 new cases linked to mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries con­firmed yes­ter­day, out of a to­tal of 87 new cases.</p>
    <p>Two were also linked to the clus­ter at Sungei Ten­gah Lodge an­nounced on Satur­day, about a month af­ter it had been closed as a clus­ter, bring­ing its to­tal to 58 cases. The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), Build­ing and</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA) and MOH said in a joint state­ment be­fore mid­night yes­ter­day that all 58 cases were asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>MOM has is­sued a stay-home no­tice to 4,800 work­ers in the dor­mi­tory as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure and will test them in the next few days, while BCA has is­sued a safety time­out no­tice to 20 con­struc­tion projects where the Covid-19-pos­i­tive work­ers had gone to work.</p>
    <p>MOH also con­firmed yes­ter­day that a 38-year-old Viet­namese male work pass holder was the sole com­mu­nity Covid-19 case. He is an un­linked case and was de­tected un­der MOH’s en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing to test all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>MOH also con­firmed yes­ter­day that a 38-year-old Viet­namese male work pass holder was the sole com­mu­nity Covid-19 case. He is an un­linked case and was de­tected un­der MOH’s en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing to test all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of the case are in progress, MOH said, adding that all the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the case have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests for his house­hold con­tacts to de­ter­mine if he could have been in­fected by them.</p>
    <p>There were also 13 im­ported cases who had all been placed on stayhome no­tice upon ar­rival in Singapore. All were tested while serv­ing their stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>Five are per­ma­nent res­i­dents who re­turned to Singapore from In­dia on Aug 11 and two are a de­pen­dant’s pass holder and a long-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from In­dia and the Philip­pines on Aug 11.</p>
    <p>Two are work per­mit hold­ers cur­rently em­ployed in Singapore who ar­rived from the Philip­pines on Aug 11.</p>
    <p>An­other two are stu­dent’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 11, while the last two are short­term visit pass hold­ers who were al­lowed en­try into Singapore as one of them has been seek­ing med­i­cal treat­ment here and the other is the par­ent and care­giver. They ar­rived from Bangladesh on Aug 21.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks, said MOH.</p>
