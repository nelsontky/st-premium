    <p>•</p>
    <p>With protests in Thai­land in­ten­si­fy­ing against the monar­chy, Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha’s hold on power is grow­ing more ten­u­ous by the day.</p>
    <p>A poll pub­lished on Sun­day by Bangkok’s Suan Dusit Univer­sity showed that more than 62 per cent of par­tic­i­pants said dis­con­tent with Mr Prayut was the key rea­son for the re­cent demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>The for­mer army chief has run Thai­land for more than six years, tak­ing power in a 2014 coup and re­turn­ing as premier af­ter elec­tions last year un­der a Con­sti­tu­tion pro­duced by his mil­i­tary regime.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut has so far re­fused to re­sign in the face of re­peated dead­lines set by pro­test­ers to step down.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a spe­cial Par­lia­ment ses­sion this week, he said the gov­ern­ment would restart next month a stalled process for amend­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion and ac­cused many law­mak­ers of hav­ing “short mem­o­ries”.</p>
    <p>“If I didn’t take power in 2014, what would hap­pen?” Mr Prayut told Par­lia­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Would there be ri­ots in Thai­land? Did you for­get all the things that hap­pened be­fore I came in? Did you for­get all the chaos, all the cor­rup­tion?”</p>
    <p>But even if Mr Prayut quits, pro­test­ers say they are not go­ing any­where un­til the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem en­gi­neered by the roy­al­ist elite is also gone.</p>
    <p>That means they will con­tinue push­ing their other de­mands: a more demo­cratic Con­sti­tu­tion and more ac­count­abil­ity for King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>Key protest leader Jatu­pat Boon­pat­tararaksa said: “The protest move­ment won’t end un­til we’ve reached all of our three de­mands.</p>
    <p>“Even if Prayut quits, some­one like Prayut will re­place him and we’ll go back to the same prob­lems again. All the changes in the gov­ern­ment, the char­ter and the monar­chy need to hap­pen at the same time.”</p>
    <p>The grow­ing re­solve of key pro­test­ers shows there is no easy short-term so­lu­tion to end the move­ment.</p>
    <p>The pro­test­ers have adopted Hong Kong-style tac­tics to keep the po­lice off bal­ance, prompt­ing Mr Prayut to lift a state of emer­gency in Bangkok last week af­ter the au­thor­i­ties strug­gled to en­force it.</p>
    <p>Much like the Hong Kong protests, which made de­mands for democ­racy that threat­ened an en­trenched power, the Thai demon­stra­tors are look­ing to up­end the roy­al­ist elite that has run the coun­try for much of its history.</p>
    <p>While China man­aged to stem large-scale protests by im­ple­ment­ing a re­pres­sive na­tional se­cu­rity law, Thai­land’s lead­ers po­ten­tially face a greater risk with a more ag­gres­sive re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Any ac­tion that leads to blood­shed – which has oc­curred through­out Thai­land’s history, most re­cently in 2010 – could fur­ther hurt an econ­omy de­pen­dent on trade and tourism that is al­ready reel­ing from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s bench­mark SET In­dex has al­ready fallen al­most 24 per cent this year, the big­gest drop in Asia.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Siri­pan Nog­suan Sawas­dee, head of the Depart­ment of Gov­ern­ment at Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity’s Fac­ulty of Po­lit­i­cal Sci­ence, feels Mr Prayut would con­sider re­sign­ing only if the gov­ern­ment loses le­git­i­macy as a re­sult of us­ing force on pro­test­ers or an eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment, for now, still has the up­per hand,” she said.</p>
    <p>Even if Mr Prayut goes, the sys­tem that al­lowed him to take power with­out stand­ing in the elec­tion is still in place. The Con­sti­tu­tion now gives the 250-mem­ber Se­nate, which is ap­pointed by the mil­i­tary, a vote for the prime min­is­ter along with the 500-mem­ber Lower House – stack­ing the odds in favour of es­tab­lish­ment can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Pos­si­ble re­place­ments for Mr Prayut in­clude Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Anutin Charn­vi­rakul and for­mer premier Ab­hisit Ve­j­ja­jiva, who were both nom­i­nated for the top post dur­ing the last elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But if they do not muster enough sup­port, the char­ter al­lows for the pos­si­bil­ity of an “out­sider” can­di­date to con­test, with an­a­lysts say­ing that it could in­clude some­one like Mr Api­rat Kong­som­pong, a for­mer army chief who is now work­ing for the palace.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor of pol­i­tics Pun­chada Sirivunna­bood from Mahi­dol Univer­sity near Bangkok said: “The sys­tem was de­signed to keep the es­tab­lish­ment in power, so it’s un­likely that they’ll do any­thing to change that struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“They may agree to ei­ther some changes to the Con­sti­tu­tion or the gov­ern­ment’s res­ig­na­tion, but not both.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nal de­mand on changes to the monar­chy is the most am­bi­tious. Pro­test­ers have bro­ken longheld ta­boos about pub­licly crit­i­cis­ing the royal fam­ily, with de­mands for the monarch to no longer en­dorse coups, to pro­vide trans­parency in how funds are spent, and get rid of laws that sti­fle dis­cus­sion on the royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have be­gun mak­ing their case on the world stage: On</p>
    <p>Mon­day, they sub­mit­ted a let­ter to the Ger­man Em­bassy in Bangkok, ask­ing the gov­ern­ment in Ber­lin to in­ves­ti­gate the King, who spends much of his time in the Euro­pean coun­try, over tax and visa vi­o­la­tions there.</p>
    <p>Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas said the au­thor­i­ties were ex­am­in­ing the is­sues and warned there would be “im­me­di­ate con­se­quences” if they found any­thing il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>The Thai palace has not com­mented on the pro­test­ers’ de­mands or the re­marks from the Ger­man au­thor­i­ties. Calls to the Bureau of the Royal House­hold seek­ing com­ments went unan­swered.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Christo­pher Ankersen, from the School of Pro­fes­sional Stud­ies’ Cen­tre for Global Af­fairs at New York Univer­sity, said: “The stu­dent de­mand for a re­form to the monar­chy is the least likely to be ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>“It’s not ev­i­dent that this King would be in­ter­ested in agree­ing to them. It’s dif­fi­cult to imag­ine him be­ing con­vinced to ‘re­tire’ from the scene, re­lin­quish day-to-day con­trol over the king­dom or live out the rest of his days as a true con­sti­tu­tional monarch.”</p>
    <p>Still, protest or­gan­is­ers like Mr Jatu­pat be­lieve they have mo­men­tum on their side, de­spite the long odds.</p>
    <p>He said: “Each time we hold a demon­stra­tion, there are more and more peo­ple join­ing. Peo­ple are op­ti­mistic that there will be changes.”</p>
    <p>THE ROOT OF THE PROB­LEM</p>
    <p>Even if Prayut quits, some­one like Prayut will re­place him and we’ll go back to the same prob­lems again. All the changes in the gov­ern­ment, the char­ter and the monar­chy need to hap­pen at the same time.</p>
    <p>MR JATU­PAT BOON­PAT­TARARAKSA, a key protest leader, on how pro­test­ers have other de­mands be­sides want­ing Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha to re­sign.</p>
