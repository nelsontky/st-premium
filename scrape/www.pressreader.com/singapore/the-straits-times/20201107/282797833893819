    <p>LON­DON • Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer vowed yes­ter­day he would not “fall like a house of cards” af­ter dam­ag­ing de­feats ramped up the pres­sure on the Manch­ester United man­ager.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils re­acted im­pres­sively fol­low­ing the chas­ten­ing 6-1 home de­feat by Tot­ten­ham early last month, but things have gone badly awry in the past week.</p>
    <p>United fell to an em­bar­rass­ing 2-1 loss to Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir in the Cham­pi­ons League on Wed­nes­day, just days af­ter a 1-0 de­feat at home by Arse­nal.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils are lan­guish­ing in 15th spot in the Premier League ta­ble and scru­tiny has ratch­eted up on Sol­sk­jaer ahead of to­day’s crunch trip to Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>United will have their low­est points tally af­ter seven matches since the 1989-90 sea­son if they fail to win at Good­i­son Park.</p>
    <p>But asked at his vir­tual pre­match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day if he was still cer­tain of be­ing a suc­cess at Old Traf­ford as he was when per­ma­nently ap­pointed man­ager in March last year, Sol­sk­jaer said: “Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?</p>
    <p>“If I don’t trust my be­liefs and val­ues and my staff’s qual­ity and the play­ers’ qual­ity, who else should?</p>
    <p>“I don’t look at one or two re­sults and fall like a house of cards, it’s a set­back, def­i­nitely, there’s been too much made of not scor­ing against Arse­nal and Chelsea.</p>
    <p>“There’ve been noth­ing in those games and it’s not long ago we were the best thing since sliced bread against Leipzig and PSG.”</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian also in­sisted nei­ther he nor the play­ers were too down­cast over their re­cent bad run of re­sults and he was trust­ing them to show a “re­sponse” against the Tof­fees, who are fourth in the ta­ble and six points above United, hav­ing played a game more.</p>
    <p>“You have to be men­tally strong, there are de­mands on Manch­ester United play­ers, coaches and man­ager,” the for­mer United striker said.</p>
    <p>“There is an ex­pec­ta­tion, we are at the best and big­gest club in the world and you don’t ex­pect any­thing but crit­i­cism then. It’s how you deal with that set­back and from what I’ve seen from the boys, they’ve been very fo­cused... I be­came a man at Manch­ester United</p>
    <p>There is an ex­pec­ta­tion, we are at the best and big­gest club in the world and you don’t ex­pect any­thing but crit­i­cism then. It’s how you deal with that set­back and from what I’ve seen from the boys they’ve been very fo­cused.</p>
    <p>OLE GUN­NAR SOL­SK­JAER, United man­ager, on over­com­ing ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>and have learnt how to deal with good and bad times.”</p>
    <p>But re­turn­ing to win­ning ways could be tricky af­ter United failed to have the lunch-time kick-off resched­uled.</p>
    <p>“It might have an im­pact on the team selec­tion and subs we make de­pend­ing on the game of course,” Sol­sk­jaer ad­mit­ted ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“12.30pm on a Satur­day doesn’t help us but that’s what the Cham­pi­ons League gives to you.”</p>
    <p>Ever­ton man­ager Carlo Ancelotti be­lieves his side should have a “phys­i­cal ad­van­tage” to­day as they look to bounce back from con­sec­u­tive de­feats.</p>
    <p>“The top teams have a re­ally, re­ally big sched­ule so it is re­ally dif­fi­cult for them,” said the Ital­ian, who will wel­come back play­maker James Rodriguez and de­fender Lu­cas Digne but re­mains with­out the sus­pended Richarli­son.</p>
    <p>“So we can take ad­van­tage of this on a phys­i­cal as­pect, above all.”</p>
