    <p>• A se­nior US in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cial said the White House or­dered him to stop re­port­ing on Rus­sian elec­tion in­ter­fer­ence and high­light Chi­nese and Iran med­dling in­stead, ac­cord­ing to a whis­tle-blower com­plaint.</p>
    <p>Of­fer­ing ex­plo­sive ev­i­dence to sup­port Demo­cratic al­le­ga­tions that United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has ma­nip­u­lated in­tel­li­gence to sup­port his re-elec­tion ef­fort, Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity (DHS) an­a­lyst Brian Mur­phy said he was told by act­ing DHS chief Chad Wolf that as­sess­ments on the Rus­sian threat made Mr Trump “look bad”.</p>
    <p>Mr Wolf told him the or­der to sti­fle his analy­ses “specif­i­cally orig­i­nated from White House Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien”, a top Trump aide, Mr Mur­phy al­leged.</p>
    <p>Mr Mur­phy, a se­nior of­fi­cial in DHS’ Of­fice of In­tel­li­gence and Anal­y­sis, said he re­fused to cen­sor his re­port­ing on Rus­sians and on the do­mes­tic white su­prem­a­cist threat, “as do­ing so would put the coun­try in sub­stan­tial and spe­cific dan­ger”.</p>
    <p>In re­tal­i­a­tion, he was de­moted last month, he said. The com­plaint, re­leased by the Demo­crat-led House In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee on Wed­nes­day, came af­ter months of re­ports that the White House was down­play­ing the Rus­sian elec­tion threat, de­spite what US in­tel­li­gence chiefs have said was mas­sive in­ter­fer­ence in the 2016 cam­paign that brought Mr Trump to power.</p>
    <p>In an of­fi­cial state­ment on elec­tion in­ter­fer­ence on Aug 7, the Direc­torate of Na­tional In­tel­li­gence fo­cused on what it said was ac­tive in­ter­fer­ence by China and Iran.</p>
    <p>DHS re­jected the al­le­ga­tions of in­tel­li­gence ma­nip­u­la­tion and re­tal­i­a­tion against Mr Mur­phy.</p>
    <p>“We flatly deny that there is any truth to the mer­its of Mr Mur­phy’s claim,” said depart­ment spokesman Alexei Woltor­nist.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mi­crosoft re­cently alerted one of Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den’s main elec­tion cam­paign ad­vi­sory firms that it had been tar­geted by sus­pected Rus­sian state-backed hack­ers, ac­cord­ing to three sources.</p>
    <p>The hack­ing at­tempts tar­geted staff at Wash­ing­ton-based SKDKnicker­bocker, a cam­paign strat­egy and com­mu­ni­ca­tions firm work­ing with Mr Bi­den and other prom­i­nent Democrats, over the past two months, the sources said. One said the hack­ers failed to gain ac­cess to the firm’s net­works.</p>
