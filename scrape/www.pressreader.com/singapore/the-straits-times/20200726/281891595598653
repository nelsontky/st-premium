    <p>BANGKOK • The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has given Thai ed­u­ca­tion an un­ex­pected leg-up by forc­ing even the most re­sis­tant teach­ers to learn how to de­liver l es­sons through video con­fer­enc­ing, ac­cord­ing to Thai­land’s Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Nat­aphol Teep­suwan.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times, he said that less than 50 per cent of Thai teach­ers had ba­sic dig­i­tal skills like video con­fer­enc­ing be­fore the pan­demic. But now, some 98 per cent are pro­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>“They learnt from their fel­low teach­ers, younger teach­ers. They learnt among them­selves. They learnt from their chil­dren. They learnt from whomever they could, with­out full as­sis­tance from the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion,” said Mr Nat­aphol, adding that the pan­demic “was a bless­ing in dis­guise”.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry post­poned the re­open­ing of schools from May 18 to July 1, to give it­self time to pre­pare for a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that pe­riod, it read­ied a dis­tance-learn­ing sys­tem us­ing both on­line as well as ded­i­cated tele­vi­sion chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The min­istry ini­tially told teach­ers to pre­pare to do this for the long haul, but later restarted class­room lessons as the coro­n­avirus out­break in the coun­try eased. It has not seen any com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in two months.</p>
    <p>Bud­get funds that went un­used for ac­tiv­i­ties cut short by the pan­demic, like scout camps, were redi­rected to buy­ing the equip­ment needed for re­mote learn­ing.</p>
    <p>“To my sur­prise, 98 per cent of teach­ers around Thai­land now have some ba­sic dig­i­tal skills… They had ac­quired them over the 40 days. Amaz­ing. But of course, they had thought that they would have to go on­line and teach for a long pe­riod of time,” he said.</p>
    <p>These dig­i­tal skills came in handy last week when over 200 schools in Ray­ong prov­ince had to be shut down over a pos­si­ble new out­break.</p>
    <p>An Egyp­tian mil­i­tary of­fi­cer on a lay­over in the prov­ince’s U-Ta­pao air­port was found to be in­fected only af­ter he had left Thai­land. Dur­ing his tran­sit, he had vis­ited a Ray­ong shop­ping mall.</p>
    <p>“We had post­poned the school re­open­ing in prepa­ra­tion for cases like this,” said Mr Nat­aphol.</p>
    <p>And be­cause re­mote teach­ing ar­range­ments kicked in dur­ing this tem­po­rary shut­down, there was “no in­ter­rup­tion” in learn­ing, he said. Schools in Ray­ong re­opened last Mon­day.</p>
