    <p>The news seems un­real to even the most ex­pe­ri­enced in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Even as many coun­tries suf­fer huge eco­nomic dam­age as they grap­ple with the out­break of Covid-19 cases, the stock mar­ket in the United States, the coun­try with the high­est num­ber of cases and deaths, has ral­lied to record highs.</p>
    <p>A key rea­son for this phe­nom­e­non is the me­te­oric per­for­mance of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic is bad news for most busi­nesses, those that pro­vide ser­vices re­lated to on­line trans­ac­tions and en­ter­tain­ment thrive even more when peo­ple are forced to stay at and work from home.</p>
    <p>In­deed, a sub­stan­tial amount of the fire­power that is boost­ing the stock mar­ket rally in the US comes from the so-called “Faang” stocks – Face­book, Ama­zon, Ap­ple, Net­flix and Google – the five tech ti­tans that make up more than 20 per cent of the S&P 500’s mar­ket cap.</p>
    <p>As in­vestor sen­ti­ment and stock mar­ket per­for­mances world­wide are of­ten in­flu­enced by the US bourse, is it time for Sin­ga­pore­ans to act on their Fomo (fear of miss­ing out) and jump in now?</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the stock mar­ket here has yet to see sim­i­lar ral­lies although volatil­ity is high.</p>
    <p>Of course, the bil­lion-dol­lar ques­tion hinges on whether the US rally will con­tinue, even as more peo­ple are los­ing jobs and in­comes world­wide.</p>
    <p>There is no easy an­swer, be­cause even high-pro­file ex­perts and rich in­vestors seem to give mixed sig­nals on what will hap­pen next.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, fi­nance pro­fes­sor Jeremy Siegel from the Whar­ton School of the Univer­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia re­cently gave a bullish mar­ket out­look that was buoyed by the race to cre­ate Covid-19 vac­cines as well as the con­tin­ual fi­nan­cial stim­u­lus from the US govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Even if it takes another six months more than we hope to get an ef­fec­tive vac­cine, when you come back with the liq­uid­ity that’s pro­vided by the Fed, that’s a re­ally pow­er­ful force,” he told CNBC.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing stocks are largely driven by sen­ti­ment, he ex­plained that the mar­ket should hold up in the com­ing months even as the world grap­ples with eco­nomic slow­down and a lin­ger­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, bil­lion­aire in­vestor Mark Mo­bius warns that the stock rally will not last, and this ap­pears to be the wide­spread sen­ti­ment of many in­vestors glob­ally as they have col­lec­tively caused a mod­ern-day gold rush that has pushed the price of the pre­cious metal to a record high. Gold is of­ten seen as the best in­vest­ment when things are not go­ing well.</p>
    <p>While the jury is still out, here are some things you should still carry on do­ing dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>DON’T STOP SAV­ING FOR YOUR FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple have the wrong idea that as times are bad, you can stop sav­ing for re­tire­ment and spend the money now.</p>
    <p>In­deed, you can see an in­crease in the num­ber of younger peo­ple who have called for the re­lax­ation of Central Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) rules so they can use the funds to tide them over.</p>
    <p>Yes, times are hard, but do think for a mo­ment – if a sim­i­lar calamity strikes again when you are in your 60s or 70s, how are you go­ing to get by if you do not even have the CPF as your last line of fi­nan­cial de­fence?</p>
    <p>The whole pur­pose of plan­ning for re­tire­ment is to al­low you to en­joy a steady in­come when you are older, so that you do not have to con­tinue work­ing.</p>
    <p>So if you choose to spend money today that is meant for your fu­ture, you face a big­ger risk of hav­ing to work through old age when your funds dry up.</p>
    <p>The good news is that fi­nan­cial plan­ning is a long-term af­fair, and you do well if you squir­rel away bit by bit now, even as you bat­tle through this storm.</p>
    <p>At the very least, you should keep an eye on your CPF bal­ances and try to hit a de­cent amount of be­tween $190,000 and $288,000 for your CPF Life by 55.</p>
    <p>This will en­able you to re­ceive a steady monthly in­come of be­tween $1,400 and $2,400 from age 65, which can help you pay for your liv­ing ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, if you are in­vested in funds and shares, you should not be in a hurry to sell ev­ery­thing if these are in­tended as your longterm in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>In­stead, look for op­por­tu­ni­ties to make changes to your port­fo­lio so that you can reap bet­ter re­turns when the mar­ket re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­less it is ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary to ease cash flow, you should also not sur­ren­der in­surance poli­cies that are meant for your re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>DON’T BE TEMPTED BY STO­RIES OF PEO­PLE MAK­ING HUGE PROF­ITS</p>
    <p>The stock mar­ket is akin to a bat­tle­field be­cause its very na­ture is that it must pro­duce win­ners and losers at the same time.</p>
    <p>If you have bought a win­ning stock, this means some­one else has sold it pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>If you sold a stock just be­fore its value plunged, then the in­vestor who bought it will suf­fer losses im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>If you are buy­ing stocks by fol­low­ing the herd, you risk be­ing lured to buy shares that oth­ers are ea­ger to dump.</p>
    <p>Be aware that it is hard to be­come rich in the stock mar­ket un­less you are rich to be­gin with.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing you are lucky to pick a stock whose value goes up 50 per cent, you will make only $50,000 even if you have put in $100,000.</p>
    <p>Of course, if you put in $1 mil­lion, the re­turn is size­able, at $500,000.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this in­spires you to go for broke to make a killing, ask your­self first: Can you stom­ach a loss of $500,000 if the stock goes the other way?</p>
    <p>DON’T BOR­ROW TO BUY SHARES</p>
    <p>If you take out a loan to buy shares, you are now gam­bling and no longer in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, if you need a loan, it means you don’t have ex­cess cash and that you are will­ing to stake your fam­ily’s well-be­ing for a chance to make a quick buck.</p>
    <p>At best, you stand to win a few months of “easy money” to splurge, but at worst, you end up in mis­ery for years be­cause a loan must be re­paid.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of bet­ting with money you do not own can be dire – a 20-year-old in the United States com­mit­ted sui­cide re­cently af­ter ap­par­ently chalk­ing up a loss of close to $1 mil­lion on an on­line in­vest­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>IN­VEST TO GROW MONEY, NOT TO BE­COME RICH</p>
    <p>Even if you know that the Ap­ple stock has po­ten­tial, it is hard to make a lot of money from it when it is al­ready trad­ing above US$130 a share, even af­ter its four-to-one stock split last week.</p>
    <p>With­out the split, the stock would be worth over US$520 a share.</p>
    <p>This is why many peo­ple like to punt on penny stocks – they can buy a lot more shares, so they stand to reap big prof­its when the price bal­loons.</p>
    <p>But peo­ple of­ten for­get there is a rea­son why such stocks cost only pen­nies in the first place. It is be­cause the busi­nesses have yet to show out­stand­ing per­for­mances or prof­its, and those who chase the price up are do­ing so on acts of faith that the com­pa­nies will de­liver re­sults that jus­tify their in­flated share prices.</p>
    <p>Very of­ten, many in­vestors end up be­ing burnt when they find them­selves still hold­ing on to the shares when the party ends and the price tum­bles.</p>
    <p>So do your­self a favour and look at the most ba­sic in­di­ca­tors be­fore you buy into an un­known stock.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, you should be con­vinced that the com­pany is al­ready op­er­at­ing a sound busi­ness that pro­duces good prof­its, and that it is not de­pen­dent on fu­ture acts that may or may not hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Also, look at its av­er­age vol­ume of trade be­fore any hype that ar­ti­fi­cially in­flates its de­mand. If its trade is low, it means that it will be hard to sell your shares even if you have made a big profit.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the very na­ture of in­vest­ing means that you should pat your­self on the back if you suc­ceed in mak­ing only mod­est gains. If you ex­pect a lot more, it means you are no longer an in­vestor but a gam­bler.</p>
    <p>If you choose to spend money today that is meant for your fu­ture, you face a big­ger risk of hav­ing to work through old age when your funds dry up. The good news is that fi­nan­cial plan­ning is a long-term af­fair, and you do well if you squir­rel away bit by bit now, even as you bat­tle through this storm.</p>
