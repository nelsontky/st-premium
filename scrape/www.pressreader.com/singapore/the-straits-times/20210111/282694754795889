    <p>SEOUL • South Korean ac­tress Song Hye-kyo (left) will re­turn to the small screen in a new drama by screen­writer Kim Eun-sook, the mas­ter­mind be­hind hit dra­mas such as De­scen­dants Of The Sun (2016) and Goblin (2016 to 2017).</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to pro­duc­tion com­pany Hwa & Dam Pic­tures, the new eight-part drama se­ries, ti­tled The Glory, tells the story of a woman who dreamt of be­ing an ar­chi­tect when she was young but had to quit school due to se­vere bul­ly­ing from her class­mates.</p>
    <p>She later be­comes a teacher to take re­venge on those who bul­lied her and those who re­mained silent at the time.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Ahn Gil-ho will head the se­ries in its pre-pro­duc­tion. It is set to begin shoot­ing in the lat­ter half of this year. How­ever, the ex­act sched­ule has not been fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>The Glory marks Song’s muchan­tic­i­pated re­turn to tele­vi­sion, her first since her hit tvN drama, En­counter, which wrapped up in 2019.</p>
    <p>It is the sec­ond time Song, 39, will be work­ing with Kim.</p>
    <p>Song pre­vi­ously ap­peared i n Kim’s hit mil­i­tary ro­mance De­scen­dants Of The Sun, which also starred Song Joong-ki, 35.</p>
    <p>The on-screen cou­ple an­nounced in July 2017 that they would tie the knot on Oct 31 that year after pre­vi­ously deny­ing that they were dat­ing in real life.</p>
    <p>They an­nounced their di­vorce in June 2019.</p>
