    <p>Walk­ing in Sin­ga­pore weather is a dicey propo­si­tion. If it is not scorch­ing hot, it is pour­ing rain. The com­bi­na­tion of both heat and humidity makes walk­ing even just a short dis­tance a test of en­durance.</p>
    <p>Add a com­pul­sory face mask and only mad dogs and English­men, as the song goes, go out in the mid­day sun.</p>
    <p>Still, with air travel lim­ited and Sin­ga­pore­ans in search of recre­ation within na­tional bounds, her­itage trails present an in­trigu­ing propo­si­tion – learn about Sin­ga­pore his­tory while get­ting in that pre­scribed 10,000 steps a day.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) has col­lated 19 her­itage trails across the is­land since 1999, and they cover a good range of Sin­ga­pore’s geog­ra­phy and his­tory. But are all of them worth slog­ging through?</p>
    <p>Four Sun­day Times re­porters sussed out the best and worst of the trails, us­ing NHB’s Roots.gov.sg site as a ref­er­ence point. Most of the trails were cov­ered on foot and with pub­lic trans­port un­less other­wise stated.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, the web­site was in dire straits last month when the team be­gan ex­plor­ing the trails. It was not mo­bile-friendly. Some map pins were wildly off the mark, with at least one pin lo­cated in the mid­dle of a road.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­ma­tions of to­tal trail dis­tances were fla­grantly in­ac­cu­rate, so we have in­cluded the num­ber of steps, as a rough ap­prox­i­ma­tion of ac­tual dis­tances cov­ered, if one were to fol­low the site’s full trail sug­ges­tions.</p>
    <p>As The Sun­day Times re­porters dis­cov­ered, some trails are in­sanely long and un­man­age­able solely on foot. The Yishun-Sem­bawang trail, for ex­am­ple, had 30 stops, which took 71/ hours to cover in both a</p>
    <p>2 car and on foot. The World War II trail is even more manic, span­ning some 50 sites in the PDF book­let.</p>
    <p>An NHB spokesman has ac­knowl­edged that the Roots web­site has is­sues. It is re­fresh­ing the web­site, which now boasts a new Pin­ter­est-style lay­out, and the YishunSem­bawang trail will be stream­lined by the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>De­spite the is­sues, the her­itage trails of­fer a good way to ex­plore neigh­bour­hoods and un­earth new nuggets about places Sin­ga­pore­ans sel­dom think twice about.</p>
    <p>Who knew, for ex­am­ple, that renowned phi­lan­thropist Tan Tock Seng’s tomb is just a stone’s throw from the bustling Tiong Bahru neigh­bour­hood?</p>
    <p>Just some things to note if you are plan­ning to tackle any trail:</p>
    <p>• Dress com­fort­ably and arm your­self with sun­screen and an um­brella.</p>
    <p>• When ex­plor­ing re­li­gious in­sti­tu­tions, be mind­ful about dress and photograph­y, and take note that be­cause of the pan­demic, en­try might be re­stricted.</p>
    <p>• Take this guide with you and happy trails!</p>
