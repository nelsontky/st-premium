    <p>Dis­ney’s live ac­tion re­make of Mu­lan has been hit with calls for a boy­cott even be­fore hit­ting the big screen in China. The calls erupted af­ter it was re­vealed that scenes were shot in Xin­jiang, where the gov­ern­ment has been ac­cused of hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney might have meant to in­fuse Chi­nese el­e­ments into the movie but its un­der­stand­ing of the cul­ture has been shal­low, said Dr Wei Wuhui who spe­cialises in me­dia stud­ies at the Shang­hai Jiao­tong Univer­sity. “Chi­nese view­ers aren’t go­ing to be de­terred by the con­tro­versy (over Xin­jiang), but it’s just a truly bad movie,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore hit­ting the big screens in main­land China, Dis­ney’s lav­ish US$200 mil­lion (S$273 mil­lion) live-ac­tion re­make of Mu­lan has been hit with con­tro­versy, de­lays and calls for a boy­cott.</p>
    <p>Fresh calls to shun the movie erupted on Twit­ter ear­lier this week af­ter it was re­vealed that film­mak­ers had shot scenes in China’s west­ern re­gion of Xin­jiang, where the gov­ern­ment has been ac­cused of hu­man rights abuses against its Mus­lim Uighur pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In China, where the movie is set to open to­mor­row, early view­ers have also panned the film on movie re­view site Douban, rat­ing it 4.7 points out of 10, ac­cus­ing pro­duc­ers of Ori­en­tal­ism and mis­in­ter­pret­ing Chi­nese cul­ture.</p>
    <p>But it re­mains to be seen whether the on­line furore will be re­flected in the box of­fice for a movie that has bro­ken 2020 box-of­fice records in both Thai­land and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The film by di­rec­tor Niki Caro about a leg­endary fe­male Chi­nese war­rior first at­tracted con­tro­versy last year when lead ac­tress Liu Yifei voiced sup­port for the Hong Kong po­lice, who were ac­cused of abus­ing their power against pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially sched­uled for a March re­lease, screen­ings were resched­uled at least twice be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with Dis­ney even­tu­ally say­ing it would go straight to its Dis­ney+ stream­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est furore erupted af­ter hawk-eyed view­ers spot­ted “spe­cial thanks” to eight gov­ern­ment en­ti­ties in Xin­jiang – in­clud­ing the pub­lic se­cu­rity bu­reau in Tur­pan, a city in eastern Xin­jiang where mul­ti­ple in­tern­ment camps have been doc­u­mented. Pro­duc­ers also thanked the Com­mu­nist Party of China’s pro­pa­ganda de­part­ment in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent sparked re­newed crit­i­cism of Hol­ly­wood bow­ing down to China just for ac­cess to the world’s sec­ond-largest movie mar­ket.</p>
    <p>While it is not sur­pris­ing that Dis­ney acted like a Chi­nese com­pany just to op­er­ate in the coun­try, much of the scenery could have been shot else­where, said Univer­sity of Vir­ginia As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor of Me­dia Stud­ies Aynne Kokas.</p>
    <p>Yet calls for a boy­cott might not gain trac­tion be­cause those fol­low­ing the move­ment on Twit­ter might not be of the same de­mo­graphic as those watch­ing a movie on Dis­ney+.</p>
    <p>“A lot of com­pa­nies make de­ci­sions that aren’t hu­man rights norms, but in the Dis­ney case it’s jar­ring; it’s be­cause it’s a fam­ily com­pany,” said Prof Kokas, who au­thored the book Hol­ly­wood Made In China.</p>
    <p>Rights ac­tivists have also crit­i­cised the com­pany for film­ing in an area where China has been ac­cused of re­pres­sion and hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“They ob­vi­ously know what’s hap­pen­ing there, the se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion that has been hap­pen­ing there and the re­pres­sion that has been go­ing on for many years, and to still film there? It’s dis­gust­ing,” said gen­eral sec­re­tary Arslan Hi­dayat of rights group Uyghur Re­vival As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Though most of the film­ing took place at least two years ago when the sit­u­a­tion was slightly dif­fer­ent, that Dis­ney would thank the Xin­jiang pro­pa­ganda de­part­ment smacks of “in­com­pe­tence or a com­plete dis­re­gard for hu­man rights in China”, said Mr Isaac Stone Fish, a se­nior fel­low at the Asia So­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“US com­pa­nies like Dis­ney should learn there are very real con­se­quences in the United States for part­ner­ing with Xin­jiang. No mat­ter what they think is nec­es­sary, there are hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>In China, ne­ti­zens fix­ated on the film’s cul­tural rep­re­sen­ta­tion, ac­cus­ing it of pre­sent­ing a Western­ised ver­sion of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese ref­er­ences stuffed into the mid­dle of this taste like Gen­eral Tso’s chicken,” read one com­ment on Douban, the Chi­nese ver­sion of movie data­base IMDb, where nearly 70,000 peo­ple have re­viewed the movie, mostly giv­ing two-star rat­ings.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney has “mis­un­der­stood” the story of Mu­lan while get­ting the Chi­nese story “hor­rif­i­cally wrong”, wrote an un­signed com­men­tary on Sina News, one of China’s most widely read web­sites, metic­u­lously pick­ing out the var­i­ous cul­tural, his­tor­i­cal and ge­o­graph­i­cal el­e­ments the movie got wrong.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney might have meant to in­fuse Chi­nese el­e­ments into the movie but its un­der­stand­ing of the cul­ture has been shal­low, said Dr Wei Wuhui who spe­cialises in me­dia stud­ies at the Shang­hai Jiao­tong Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese view­ers aren’t go­ing to be de­terred by the con­tro­versy (over Xin­jiang), but it’s just a truly bad movie,” he said.</p>
    <p>The stu­dio has hopes that it can do bet­ter than the an­i­mated ver­sion from 1998 – the film had its re­lease de­layed by a year af­ter Dis­ney’s re­la­tions with China soured over Kun­dun, its 1997 movie based on the life of the ex­iled Dalai Lama, whom China has branded a dan­ger­ous sep­a­ratist. But it re­mains to be seen whether the con­tro­versy would lead to re­duced box-of­fice tak­ings this week­end.</p>
