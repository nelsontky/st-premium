    <p>Lo­cal ac­tress Hong Huifang thought she was dy­ing.</p>
    <p>That was af­ter she had to be taken to hospi­tal af­ter suf­fer­ing se­vere chest pain last year.</p>
    <p>Hong re­counted the in­ci­dent to the lo­cal Chi­nese me­dia re­cently dur­ing an in­ter­view for Recipe Of Life, a new food-themed se­rial she is film­ing.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old vet­eran ac­tress, who is mar­ried to fel­low ac­tor Zheng Geping, said she has “three highs” – high choles­terol, high blood pres­sure and high blood sugar.</p>
    <p>She had a health scare due to high blood pres­sure last year, Lianhe Wan­bao re­ported.</p>
    <p>“I woke up in the mid­dle of the night with my chest hurt­ing so much that I couldn’t breathe and broke out in a cold sweat. I didn’t know what was go­ing on and felt like dy­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I en­dured the pain un­til 7am and then woke Geping up to send me to hospi­tal.”</p>
    <p>The pain in her chest felt like some­one had “kicked her in the front and the back” and was so bad that she felt that she might fall any­time.</p>
    <p>On the way to hospi­tal, she told Zheng about mat­ters such as her bank ac­count pass­word and where she had put the im­por­tant doc­u­ments in case some­thing hap­pened to her.</p>
    <p>“Luck­ily t he chest pain was caused by high blood pres­sure and not due to clogged blood ves­sels,” Hong said. “My con­di­tion has sta­bilised and I try not to eat fried chicken skin as much as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Hong, who rose to fame af­ter act­ing in TV se­ries Sam­sui Women (1986), has two grown-up chil­dren – daugh­ter Tay Ying and son Calvert.</p>
    <p>While her hus­band Zheng, 56, has been fol­low­ing a strict diet to keep up his health and physique since 2009, Hong said she was quite the op­po­site.</p>
    <p>“At that time, what we ate were to­tally dif­fer­ent. He would eat at home first even when we went out to eat,” she said.</p>
    <p>“When I wanted to go out and have a sump­tu­ous meal, he would or­der a cup of black cof­fee with­out sugar and watch me eat. Even­tu­ally, I ate at home as I didn’t feel like go­ing out to eat.”</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ued: “When we ate fried chicken, he would take out the skin and eat only the breast meat. I would then eat the skin as I would think, ‘since you don’t eat, I eat.’”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Hong is now more con­scious of her health.</p>
    <p>“My ‘three highs’ are very se­ri­ous and my hus­band says I can’t con­tinue eat­ing this way, so I am chang­ing slowly,” she said.</p>
    <p>Nowa­days, when they go out for meals, she eats the same food as Zheng, but she says she will still eat “good food” oc­ca­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>“We work so hard for the money, so that we can have three meals,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that her hus­band and two chil­dren also urged her to ex­er­cise at home.</p>
    <p>“When I say I do house­work, they say house­work is not ex­er­cise but phys­i­cal work,” she said.</p>
