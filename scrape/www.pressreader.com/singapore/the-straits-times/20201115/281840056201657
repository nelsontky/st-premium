    <p>My fa­ther did not ap­prove of my re­la­tion­ship with Joe. He never has.</p>
    <p>MS MA­RINA HABA, on her fa­ther’s feel­ings to­wards her hus­band, Joe Wal­lace (left, in photo with her).</p>
    <p>EX­TREMELY PAINFUL</p>
    <p>It was ex­tremely painful that my fa­ther, whom I have al­ways loved and shown the great­est re­spect, would take this ac­tion against me in an ef­fort to bring me un­der his con­trol and to try to force me to leave my hus­band.</p>
    <p>MS HABA, in court doc­u­ments claim­ing that her fa­ther is try­ing to force her to ac­cede to his de­mands.</p>
    <p>A bit­ter feud is tear­ing one of Ja­pan’s wealth­i­est fam­i­lies apart, with tit-for-tat law­suits amid ac­cu­sa­tions of bla­tant racism.</p>
    <p>Mr Han Chang-woo, 89, founder and chair­man of Maruhan, a lead­ing op­er­a­tor of pachinko (slot ma­chine) par­lours across Ja­pan, has sued Ms Ma­rina Haba, the el­dest of his six chil­dren, for the re­turn of a loan of 480 mil­lion yen (S$6.2 mil­lion), with in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Ms Haba, 51, who goes by the name of her first hus­band with whom she has two chil­dren, mar­ried African-Amer­i­can Joe Wal­lace in 2014.</p>
    <p>She says her fa­ther frowns upon her re­la­tion­ship with­out any merit. “My fa­ther did not ap­prove of my re­la­tion­ship with Joe. He never has,” Ms Haba says in court doc­u­ments seen by The Sun­day Times. “My fa­ther has made it plain that he does not ap­prove of my re­la­tion­ship with a black man.”</p>
    <p>Mr Han re­port­edly de­nies the al­le­ga­tions, and Maruhan’s cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity pledge says the com­pany is com­mit­ted to di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Han is a self-made en­trepreneur born in South Korea, when it was un­der Ja­panese oc­cu­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>He mi­grated to Ja­pan when he was 16, grad­u­at­ing with an eco­nom­ics de­gree from Ho­sei Univer­sity, even­tu­ally found­ing the Ky­oto­based Maruhan in 1957 and be­com­ing a nat­u­ralised Ja­panese cit­i­zen.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is a lead­ing player in Ja­pan’s US$200 bil­lion (S$270 bil­lion) pachinko in­dus­try, but has di­ver­si­fied into busi­nesses span­ning bowl­ing al­leys, golf cour­ses and cin­e­mas. Its in­vest­ment arm is based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s suc­cess has made Mr Han the coun­try’s 19thwealth­i­est man, ac­cord­ing to the Ja­pan’s 50 Rich­est list com­piled by Forbes this year. His net worth is es­ti­mated at US$3.8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The ty­coon gave all six of his chil­dren 1.5 mil­lion shares each in the com­pany many years ago, ef­fec­tively mak­ing each of them mul­ti­mil­lion­aires. While her four broth­ers now hold top po­si­tions in Maruhan, Ms Haba also ben­e­fited from the gen­eros­ity though she does not work at the com­pany.</p>
    <p>She says in her court doc­u­ments that she has been liv­ing a com­fort­able life from in­come reaped from com­pany div­i­dends. But this steady stream of in­come was abruptly cut off, she claims, due to her fa­ther’s dis­ap­proval of her re­la­tion­ship with Mr Wal­lace, 55.</p>
    <p>They first met in 1991 when Ms Haba was a col­lege stu­dent and Mr Wal­lace a pro­fes­sional bas­ket­ball player in Ja­pan. They split up after he re­tired from the sport in 1994 and be­came a mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive. Each of them would marry and form their own fam­i­lies. But they both di­vorced their re­spec­tive part­ners and re­con­nected via Face­book in 2011 and even­tu­ally wed in 2014.</p>
    <p>Mr Han has never met Mr Wal­lace, Ms Haba says in her court doc­u­ments, and con­tends that her fa­ther’s racially mo­ti­vated cam­paign to pres­sure her into mak­ing a choice be­tween her hus­band and her liveli­hood vi­o­lates her rights.</p>
    <p>She in­tends to sue her fa­ther in the Ky­oto District Court for the right­ful re­turn of her stock div­i­dends worth an es­ti­mated US$300 mil­lion, as well as to re­in­state her stock op­tions.</p>
    <p>As a first step, she has filed a court or­der in the US ter­ri­tory of Guam, where Maruhan runs a sub­sidiary of­fice, to force the com­pany to pro­duce doc­u­ments that she needs to build her case.</p>
    <p>She has en­gaged an in­ter­na­tional team of lawyers in Tokyo, Los An­ge­les and Guam, in­clud­ing from ma­jor law firm Mor­ri­son & Fo­er­ster.This strat­egy comes from the for­mi­da­ble hur­dles she would face in Ja­pan, where civil courts are typ­i­cally friendly to­wards de­fen­dants.</p>
    <p>“The type of dis­cov­ery Ms Haba seeks is com­mon in Amer­i­can courts, but un­avail­able in Ja­pan,” her at­tor­neys wrote in doc­u­ments to the Guam court. “The re­quested re­lief is for the pur­pose of ob­tain­ing lim­ited, but nec­es­sary, dis­cov­ery in con­nec­tion with a pend­ing and an­tic­i­pated civil pro­ceed­ing be­fore the Ky­oto District Court.”</p>
    <p>They cited a US law that pro­vides a mech­a­nism for par­ties to un­der­take dis­cov­ery through a US court to ob­tain in­for­ma­tion that is rel­e­vant to a for­eign civil case.</p>
    <p>If she suc­ceeds, her case will po­ten­tially open the doors for doc­u­ment dis­cov­ery in fu­ture civil law­suits in Ja­pan against firms or in­di­vid­u­als with con­nec­tions to the US.</p>
    <p>“I was forced to hire coun­sel to try to cor­rect the sit­u­a­tion,” Ms Haba says in her court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>“It was ex­tremely painful that my fa­ther, whom I have al­ways loved and shown the great­est re­spect, would take this ac­tion against me in an ef­fort to bring me un­der his con­trol and to try to force me to leave my hus­band.”</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther has filed two law­suits at the Ky­oto District Court – dated Oct 15 last year and March 24 this year – for the im­me­di­ate re­turn, with in­ter­est, of the loan.</p>
    <p>Ms Haba says in court doc­u­ments that Mr Han granted her the per­sonal loan on Sept 2 last year, after she re­turned to Ky­oto un­der fi­nan­cial duress to meet her es­tranged fa­ther to dis­cuss her fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But she claims that the loan was made only un­der such con­di­tions that she leaves Mr Wal­lace and hands over her pass­port to her fa­ther so that she can only leave Ja­pan with his per­mis­sion, among other terms.</p>
    <p>She says that she agreed out of fi­nan­cial des­per­a­tion, ac­cord­ing to the court fil­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Wal­lace and Ms Haba at­tempted to calm things down by fil­ing for divorce in a Los An­ge­les court last year, but they had never in­tended to fol­low through with it. The pro­ceed­ings are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>She could have un­der­es­ti­mated how wide and deep Mr Han’s net­work runs, how­ever, given that the cou­ple were found out barely a month after the loan was given when they were spot­ted on the streets of Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Mr Han al­legedly flew into a rage, prompt­ing the law­suits de­mand­ing the im­me­di­ate re­turn of the loan and, Ms Haba says, the seizure of her prop­erty, bank ac­counts and the with­hold­ing of her stock op­tions.</p>
    <p>Her lawyers ar­gue that this was “clearly done at Mr Han’s di­rec­tion to elim­i­nate Ms Haba’s sole source of fi­nan­cial in­de­pen­dence, to im­pose his do­min­ion and con­trol over Ms Haba, and to force her to ac­cede to his de­mands”.</p>
