    <p>When Euro­pean im­mi­grants to the United States passed through El­lis Is­land in New York har­bour in the late 19th and early 20th cen­turies, they had to stand in line to be checked for ill­nesses such as tu­ber­cu­lo­sis. Only when cer­ti­fied as healthy could they pass freely into the new world and be­come Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus is bring­ing back a hint of their ex­pe­ri­ence to global travel, with Aus­tralian car­rier Qan­tas warn­ing last week that it ex­pects to al­low only pas­sen­gers who can prove they have been vac­ci­nated on in­ter­na­tional flights.</p>
    <p>Five other air­lines also plan to of­fer dig­i­tal health passes and some coun­tries could stop peo­ple ar­riv­ing without one.</p>
    <p>This will not be the sum of health in­spec­tions to curb the pan­demic over the next year. Of­fices and pub­lic venues may scan mo­bile phone apps that link the proof of vac­ci­na­tion or a neg­a­tive test to dig­i­tal iden­ti­ties be­fore let­ting peo­ple in.</p>
    <p>Na­tional pass­ports are needed only oc­ca­sion­ally for travel, but “im­mu­nity pass­ports” could in­trude into ev­ery­day lives.</p>
    <p>Were it not for the ex­tra­or­di­nary lim­its placed on our lives since the start of the pan­demic, with gov­ern­ments dic­tat­ing how and where peo­ple can meet, this would be hard to coun­te­nance.</p>
    <p>New­cas­tle Univer­sity’s Pro­fes­sor Lil­ian Ed­wards ar­gues that im­pos­ing med­i­cal in­ter­ven­tions can pro­voke peo­ple to avoid or re­sist.</p>
    <p>But the global med­i­cal emer­gency has ac­cel­er­ated many things that were al­ready hap­pen­ing at a slower pace – from on­line shop­ping to re­mote work­ing. Dig­i­tal iden­tity is an­other ex­am­ple and, de­spite the risk it presents to lib­erty and pri­vacy, a strong in­cen­tive to con­trib­ute to pub­lic health is jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tion is un­usual in ben­e­fit­ing both the pa­tient who gets in­jected and oth­ers, since many dis­eases stop be­ing dan­ger­ous if a so­ci­ety gains herd im­mu­nity. That al­lows for free-rid­ing: Those who do not vac­ci­nate them­selves or their chil­dren against measles rely on oth­ers doing so to pro­tect</p>
    <p>them any­way.</p>
    <p>If ev­ery­one were an anti-vaxxer, herd im­mu­nity would fail and dis­eases such as diph­the­ria, po­lio and tu­ber­cu­lo­sis could re­turn to coun­tries where they have ceased to be a com­mon threat.</p>
    <p>Some states al­ready re­quire proof of vac­ci­na­tion against, for ex­am­ple, yel­low fever from</p>
    <p>trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from at-risk ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers take a lib­eral ap­proach – they en­cour­age vac­ci­na­tion, of­ten strongly, but tol­er­ate re­fusal by those who fear its com­par­a­tively tiny risks. This strikes me as un­fair, partly from my ex­pe­ri­ence of hav­ing lived in New York City, which (per­haps due to the his­tory</p>
    <p>of El­lis Is­land) is very strict.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren who are un­vac­ci­nated are not al­lowed into many New York schools. Pro­scrip­tion even ap­plies to those with head lice, which spread rapidly un­less checked. Chil­dren who catch them have to be taken out of school and sent to “nit-pick­ing” salons that comb them out and pro­vide proof of treat­ment – not dig­i­tal but ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Us­ing sim­i­lar sanc­tions to en­force coro­n­avirus pro­tec­tion on adults who fly in­ter­na­tion­ally is quite jus­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Air­lines will be wary about be­ing seen to bar cus­tomers from flights, but it is point­less to let some­one board an air­craft if he or she can­not dis­em­bark at the other end.</p>
    <p>A harder question is whether work­places, or even ho­tels and the­atres, should re­quire proof of im­mu­nity be­fore let­ting peo­ple en­ter.</p>
    <p>There will be sound rea­sons to do this – many of­fices re­main empty and al­low­ing nor­mal­ity to re­turn is a so­cial and eco­nomic ne­ces­sity. It can hap­pen only when peo­ple trust they are not in dan­ger.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments that do not make vac­ci­na­tion com­pul­sory them­selves will be tac­itly re­ly­ing on com­pa­nies and or­gan­i­sa­tions to do it for them. It will force the lat­ter to make un­pop­u­lar de­ci­sions but they should be al­lowed, even en­cour­aged, to pro­tect cus­tomers and em­ploy­ees from harm.</p>
    <p>Pri­vacy is a sec­ond con­cern – if peo­ple have to store their health de­tails on cen­tral data­bases, it may be mis­used or ex­ploited by gov­ern­ments and oth­ers. Any push for dig­i­tal iden­tity car­ries risks, although it is of­ten well mo­ti­vated – the World Bank es­ti­mates that nearly one bil­lion peo­ple find it hard to ac­cess ser­vices be­cause they lack proof of iden­tity.</p>
    <p>But pri­vacy need not be a bar­rier. The five air­lines plan­ning to of­fer dig­i­tal passes are us­ing a plat­form called Com­mon-Pass, which stores only lim­ited data on a pas­sen­ger’s phone – a QR code that shows they meet the reg­u­la­tions for en­try. No air­line wants to be re­spon­si­ble for in­spect­ing health records.</p>
    <p>Nor does an em­ployer need to pry; scan­ning a code that answers a sin­gle question – whether some­one has made the ef­fort to guar­an­tee his or her own safety and that of oth­ers – is enough.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach of us­ing a ver­i­fied QR code on a phone or pa­per as a pri­vacy shield could be used more widely.</p>
    <p>None of it is ideal: Peo­ple be­ing stopped from board­ing flights or en­ter­ing of­fices if they do not com­ply with of­fi­cial health ad­vice in­fringes on lib­erty. But mil­lions who have en­dured states of emer­gency and lock­downs have not been liv­ing in a free world. If there is an exit, lead us through it.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tion is un­usual in ben­e­fit­ing both the pa­tient who gets in­jected and oth­ers, since many dis­eases stop be­ing dan­ger­ous if a so­ci­ety gains herd im­mu­nity. That al­lows for free-rid­ing: Those who do not vac­ci­nate them­selves or their chil­dren against measles rely on oth­ers doing so to pro­tect them any­way.</p>
