    <p>The new school year brims with the prom­ise of new learn­ing ad­ven­tures, new friend­ships... and the same old mess of bags, books and toys at home. Many par­ents know the drill all too well – po­lite in­struc­tions quickly es­ca­late to des­per­ate bribes or threats, be­fore Mum and Dad ca­pit­u­late and clean up af­ter their kids.</p>
    <p>It does not have to be that way, says Mrs Aparna Chari Sun­dar, 35.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents of­ten be­lieve that their chil­dren are too young to tidy up or it would be quicker if they helped them put away their things. When this hap­pens, chil­dren don’t feel like their par­ents trust their abil­ity to take care of their be­long­ings,” says Mrs Sun­dar, a KonMari home or­gan­is­ing con­sul­tant cer­ti­fied to help peo­ple tidy their homes us­ing Marie Kondo’s meth­ods. The trained doc­tor is also a Montes­sori as­sis­tant cer­ti­fied by the As­so­ci­a­tion Montes­sori In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to pop­u­lar be­lief, even ba­bies and tod­dlers crave or­der and rou­tine, she ex­plains. Dis­or­der sends chil­dren’s stress lev­els soar­ing and is detri­men­tal to their devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The mother of two in Pri­mary 1 and 3 shares strate­gies on get­ting kids or­gan­ised for the new aca­demic year, to­gether with Ms Thian Ai Ling, gen­eral man­ager of NTUC First Cam­pus’ My First Skool child­care cen­tres.</p>
    <p>START THEM YOUNG</p>
    <p>Even pre-school­ers can get in­volved in be­ing re­spon­si­ble for their en­vi­ron­ment, Mrs Sun­dar says. This helps chil­dren feel “re­spected and em­pow­ered to be­come con­fi­dent de­ci­sion-mak­ers”, she says.</p>
    <p>Ideally, par­ents should start or­gan­is­ing their child’s study space a month be­fore school re­opens and get their lit­tle one’s in­put, she says.</p>
    <p>This could mean ask­ing them ques­tions such as “Do you need this in school next year? Does this art­work make you happy? Where shall we put this?”.</p>
    <p>As­sign tasks ap­pro­pri­ate to their age and re­sist the temp­ta­tion to take over, she adds. For in­stance, give them a child-size spray bot­tle and teach them to wipe down the shelves, get them to la­bel school items or clear bro­ken sta­tionery items. They can even learn to wash their school shoes and bag if they have a kid-size bucket and brush.</p>
    <p>Par­ents can com­plete tasks, such as cov­er­ing books, along­side as well. “You’ll be sur­prised to see how much fun they have while they clean their own things. They’re learn­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity as well.”</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, kids can have a say in big­ger is­sues that af­fect the home as well, Mrs Sun­dar says.</p>
    <p>“Even be­fore a new it em is brought into our home, my chil­dren are in­volved in the de­ci­sion­mak­ing and we ask our­selves: ‘Do we re­ally need this? How of­ten do we think we will use it? Can we rent or bor­row it? Will we use this for a short or long pe­riod of time?’”</p>
    <p>GIVE THEM THEIR OWN SPACE</p>
    <p>As chil­dren get eas­ily dis­tracted, des­ig­nat­ing a space for them at home will give them a sense of be­long­ing, says Ms Thian.</p>
    <p>“Al­low the chil­dren to plan how they want their space to look like so they can have their own iden­tity and start learn­ing to keep items af­ter use, which will be most crit­i­cal in a big group, shared-space set­ting.”</p>
    <p>Kinder­garten-age kids can also learn to plan what goes into their school bag and pack it them­selves. This is also a good time to talk to them about “tak­ing own­er­ship of their per­sonal be­long­ings” and keep­ing them safe, she adds.</p>
    <p>SET A TIDYING ROU­TINE</p>
    <p>In­stead of ran­dom spurts of or­gan­is­ing, make it a point to pro­vide an or­derly phys­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment where there is a place for every­thing, and have daily rou­tines for tidying up, Mrs Sun­dar says.</p>
    <p>This helps chil­dren as they know what to ex­pect, as well as where to find and put back their things in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>“Plan ac­tiv­i­ties ahead of time so your child feels em­pow­ered to com­plete a task in his own time (without the nag­ging),” she adds.</p>
    <p>If your kids are hun­gry, tired or seek­ing at­ten­tion, it is not a good time to ex­pect them to tidy up in­de­pen­dently. Meet their im­me­di­ate needs, then work with them on the tasks un­til they are com­pleted, she says.</p>
    <p>DE­SCRIBE RATHER THAN DE­MAND</p>
    <p>“Us­ing ob­jec­tive lan­guage in­stead of nag­ging helps them see what needs to be done rather than blam­ing or sham­ing.” Mrs Sun­dar says.</p>
    <p>If you typ­i­cally com­mand your chil­dren to “clean up”, be spe­cific in­stead. Say some­thing like “I see this book on the floor. Could we put it back on its shelf, please?”</p>
    <p>Rather than prais­ing with generic phrases like “good job”, say things like “I like how you did that in­de­pen­dently”. Avoid threats and em­pathise with your kid by say­ing “Your toys/books need to rest, just like you”.</p>
    <p>With older chil­dren, par­ents can share the con­se­quences of not putting away their din­ner plates (the ta­ble is used by ev­ery­one to do work, or left­over food at­tracts in­sects) or clothes (there is no space to sleep or play).</p>
    <p>“This helps them un­der­stand the ‘why’ be­hind tidying,” she says.</p>
    <p>BE A GOOD ROLE MODEL</p>
    <p>Think about your own at­ti­tude to tidying up. If you al­ways com­plain about it, what are your chil­dren ab­sorb­ing un­con­sciously? Set a pos­i­tive ex­am­ple and show them that while you may not be a per­fect or­gan­iser, you can prob­lem-solve. This helps them develop crit­i­cal think­ing skills as they see you man­age chal­lenges, Mrs Sun­dar says.</p>
    <p>“We must re­mem­ber that messes are al­ways tem­po­rary so long as there are ded­i­cated spa­ces as­signed to ev­ery sin­gle item in the home. It is our re­spon­si­bil­ity to give our chil­dren plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties and time to prac­tise be­fore a nat­u­ral will de­vel­ops to in­de­pen­dently put away things.”</p>
