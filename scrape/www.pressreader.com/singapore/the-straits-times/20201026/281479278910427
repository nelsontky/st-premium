    <p>In 2016, white vot­ers with­out a col­lege de­gree over­whelm­ingly backed Repub­li­can can­di­date Don­ald Trump over his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Hil­lary Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>These votes were enough to send him to the White House.</p>
    <p>But fast for­ward to 2020 and Amer­ica’s de­mo­graphic pic­ture, as well as the Pres­i­dent’s coali­tion of vot­ers, have changed.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s base of white bluecol­lar vot­ers is shrink­ing, a longterm trend driven by im­mi­gra­tion and age­ing. Polls also show Mr Trump un­der­per­form­ing with white women and white vot­ers with col­lege de­grees – omi­nous signs for his re-elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>These trends high­light the de­mo­graphic dis­ad­van­tage faced by the Repub­li­can Party, which has hitched its wagon to white vot­ers since the 1960s.</p>
    <p>They also ex­plain some of the Trump cam­paign’s ef­forts to woo black and His­panic vot­ers, of whom Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den needs as many of as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>DE­MO­GRAPHIC TRENDS</p>
    <p>White non-col­lege-ed­u­cated vot­ers are in de­cline across the US, as the num­ber of col­lege-ed­u­cated Amer­i­cans grows and im­mi­gra­tion boosts the pro­por­tion of minority vot­ers in the elec­torate.</p>
    <p>A Pew Re­search Cen­tre anal­y­sis of cen­sus data from 2000 to 2018 found that the pro­por­tion of white vot­ers in each state has di­min­ished, although they still make up the ma­jor­ity in most of them.</p>
    <p>Over the same pe­riod, His­panic vot­ers have grown in pro­por­tion in ev­ery state, with sharp in­creases in some bat­tle­ground states – Florida and Ari­zona, in par­tic­u­lar.</p>
    <p>In Florida, whose 29 elec­toral votes might swing the elec­tion for ei­ther can­di­date, 20 per cent of vot­ers are His­panic – twice as many as 10 years ago.</p>
    <p>The Pew anal­y­sis also found that more than three quar­ters of the new vot­ers added over the past two decades were His­panic, black, Asian or other non-whites.</p>
    <p>On the face of it, these trends favour the Demo­cratic Party, given the ten­dency for mi­nori­ties to vote Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>“The Repub­li­can Party faces a dim fu­ture, as the groups sup­port­ing it shrink in size while those op­pos­ing it grow in num­ber,” said Har­vard Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Thomas Pat­ter­son in a com­men­tary in The Bos­ton Globe.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that Repub­li­cans could have made in­roads with the grow­ing Latino pop­u­la­tion if they had not de­monised im­mi­grants, not­ing that most Lati­nos have con­ser­va­tive views on is­sues like abor­tion and na­tional se­cu­rity, which are in line with Repub­li­can mes­sages, but end up sup­port­ing Demo­cratic can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>A New York Times-Siena Col­lege na­tional poll last Tues­day found that 90 per cent of black vot­ers said they would vote for Mr Bi­den, while</p>
    <p>VOTER TRENDS</p>
    <p>4 per cent said they would go for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Among Latino vot­ers, 50 per cent said they would choose Mr Bi­den, com­pared with 30 per cent who would vote for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>TRUMP’S BASE</p>
    <p>An anal­y­sis by The New York Times last Thurs­day found that the num­ber of vot­ing-age white Amer­i­cans with­out col­lege de­grees de­creased by more than five mil­lion in the past four years.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the num­ber of minority vot­ers and col­lege-ed­u­cated white vot­ers in­creased by more than 13 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“In key swing states, the changes far out­strip Mr Trump’s nar­row 2016 mar­gins,” said the re­port.</p>
    <p>De­mo­graphic trends none­the­less do not tell the whole story. White vot­ers have higher lev­els of turnout than vot­ers of all other races, and fur­ther in­creas­ing their turnout could make up for short­falls else­where.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Party has been hard at work boost­ing voter reg­is­tra­tion. Their will­ing­ness to knock on doors and phys­i­cally visit peo­ple amid the Covid-19 pan­demic pro­vides them with an ad­van­tage over the Democrats. The drive raked in 146,000 more new Repub­li­can vot­ers than Democrats in Florida and 103,000 more in Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tive pun­dits have pointed to the surge in new Repub­li­can vot­ers as a sign that “shy Trump vot­ers” should not be dis­counted.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has also been gain­ing sup­port among some black and His­panic vot­ers, par­tic­u­larly men, ac­cord­ing to a FiveThir­tyEight anal­y­sis of UCLA Na­tion­scape polling data.</p>
    <p>Young black vot­ers aged 18 to 44 who sup­port Mr Trump dou­bled from around 10 per cent in 2016 to 21 per cent in UCLA Na­tion­scape’s polling, FiveThir­tyEight found.</p>
    <p>This could chip away some points from Mr Bi­den’s over­all vote share in key bat­tle­ground states, which could hand Mr Trump an­other Elec­toral Col­lege vic­tory if the con­test once again comes down to a few thou­sand votes, as it did in Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wisconsin in 2016. But Mr Trump is also do­ing worse with sub­ur­ban women and se­niors na­tion­ally, although it is swing states that will likely make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, 54 per cent of white sub­ur­ban women sup­port Mr Bi­den, com­pared with 45 per cent who sup­port Mr Trump, ac­cord­ing to FiveThir­tyEight’s anal­y­sis. White sub­ur­ban men, how­ever, are still back­ing Mr Trump to the tune of 57 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is lead­ing Mr Trump when it comes to the se­nior vote in sev­eral swing states in­clud­ing Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wisconsin, ac­cord­ing to a Morn­ing Con­sult poll on Oct 15, although the two can­di­dates are neck and neck in North Carolina, Ohio and Florida.</p>
    <p>But this is al­ready a stark turn­around from 2016, when Mr Trump won vot­ers aged 65 and older by 15 points over Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton. Mr Bi­den now leads him by 8 per­cent­age points, Morn­ing Con­sult found.</p>
    <p>Sum­ming up the trends, Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port House ed­i­tor Dave Wasser­man said on Twit­ter: “2020 polls de­pict an elec­torate po­lar­is­ing along gen­der lines, slightly de­po­lar­is­ing along racial lines and whites po­larised about the same along ed­u­ca­tional lines.”</p>
    <p>“And Bi­den has made progress with crit­i­cal bat­tle­ground groups,” he said, cit­ing se­niors and white vot­ers with­out de­grees as ex­am­ples.</p>
