    <p>Con­ti­nu­ity can give TeamSGP Ath­let­ics the edge in the up­com­ing Singapore Ath­let­ics (SA) elec­tions, said vet­eran of­fi­cial Ed­mond Pereira, who is lead­ing its slate of nine.</p>
    <p>The 70-year-old lawyer made the com­ments to the me­dia af­ter shar­ing his team’s man­i­festo and plans for the sport with af­fil­i­ates at a vir­tual town hall on yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>TeamSGP Ath­let­ics, which fea­tures in­cum­bent SA vice-pres­i­dent (train­ing and se­lec­tion) Ang Peng Siong and vice-pres­i­dent (com­pe­ti­tions) S. Govin­daraju, will be up against Team Ground Up in the Sept 25 polls.</p>
    <p>No other teams have come for­ward yet, with the dead­line for nom­i­na­tions on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Team Ground Up is led by Lien Choong Luen, gen­eral man­ager of ride-hail­ing firm Go­jek, and fea­tures no mem­bers of the cur­rent com­mit­tee, al­though two of its can­di­dates, Joe Yap and Gary Yeo, had served pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>When asked if he felt Ang and Govin­daraju give TeamSGP an ad­van­tage, Pereira said they give his team “sta­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Ob­jec­tively speak­ing, I think this will give us the edge, be­cause we have the ex­pe­ri­ence of two ex­pe­ri­enced per­sons in track and field man­age­ment, and we have the blend of younger ones… who are also in­volved in sports, and the in­ter­est, drive and pas­sion is there.</p>
    <p>“But these are all words, and words are free and cheap. It’s the deed that counts. I don’t want to make com­par­isons, but if you want to have a clean slate, where are you go­ing to start? From ground zero? I don’t know how the fra­ter­nity is go­ing to re­ceive this.</p>
    <p>“Of course it is all new… so that means we have to start all over again, but in another 10 years, we will (still) be groom­ing up slowly.</p>
    <p>“(On the other hand) We have his­tory, we are in a hurry, but at the same time we will be mea­sured in our ap­proach.”</p>
    <p>His team­mate Des­mond Lee, chair­man of Singapore Pre­mier League foot­ball club Tampines Rovers, added: “We see our­selves as peo­ple who are con­tin­u­ing to build the path.</p>
    <p>“We are just stew­ards at the mo­ment, build­ing this path. There has been a lot of good that has come in the past, not­with­stand­ing the in­fight­ing, and it would be wrong for us to say we are com­ing in on a clean slate.”</p>
    <p>SA has been rocked in re­cent years by a num­ber of is­sues such as in­fight­ing, le­gal woes and the poor per­for­mances of its ath­letes.</p>
    <p>But Ang, a for­mer na­tional swim­mer, took pains to point out the cur­rent man­age­ment com­mit­tee’s achieve­ments, high­light­ing that it man­aged to se­cure fund­ing from na­tional sports agency Sport Singapore (SportSG) for its multi-year sports plan, up un­til 2024.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion has also fos­tered bet­ter re­la­tion­ships with the ground through reg­u­lar di­a­logue with ath­letes, coaches and par­ents, he added.</p>
    <p>Pereira, who said he was en­cour­aged by sev­eral ath­letes and par­ents to run for the SA pres­i­dency again, added that its big­gest chal­lenge was to cre­ate a “con­ducive” en­vi­ron­ment for ath­letes, ad­mit­ting the cur­rent cli­mate of the sport is “murky”.</p>
    <p>This ath­lete-cen­tric fo­cus is what con­vinced for­mer na­tional sprinter and 100m record holder U.K. Shyam to join the team.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old, who was in­volved in sev­eral high-pro­file dis­putes with SA while he was an ath­lete, said: “We have many peo­ple from dif­fer­ent fields, and we have ath­letes who have been through the sys­tem… so I think it’s the bal­ance and di­ver­sity in this team that makes us dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“It’s a good bal­ance of a lot of peo­ple know­ing what a high-per­for­mance set-up is like and what the lo­cal sys­tem is like.”</p>
    <p>Other in­di­vid­u­als on TeamSGP Ath­let­ics’ slate in­clude Credit Suisse ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ger­ald Kua (vice-pres­i­dent, fi­nance and part­ner­ships), and Singapore Aeromed­i­cal Cen­tre med­i­cal di­rec­tor and for­mer air force chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Robin Low (man­age­ment com­mit­tee mem­ber).</p>
    <p>If elected, Pereira said that his team would set up eight com­mit­tees – over­see­ing ar­eas such as ath­lete de­vel­op­ment, coach­ing and train­ing, mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, and fund-rais­ing and spon­sor­ship – to ad­dress is­sues within the lo­cal track and field scene.</p>
    <p>We have many peo­ple from dif­fer­ent fields, and we have ath­letes who have been through the sys­tem… so I think it’s the bal­ance and di­ver­sity in this team</p>
    <p>that makes us dif­fer­ent.</p>
