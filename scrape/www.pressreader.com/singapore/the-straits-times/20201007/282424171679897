    <p>Head­ing into the de­layed sum­mer trans­fer win­dow for Euro­pean leagues, much was made of the ef­fect of the pan­demic on foot­ball fi­nances: How would teams re­act to the lost in­come from the end of last sea­son and the be­gin­ning of this, given that the ab­sence of fans in sta­dia will likely con­tinue un­til the end of the year?</p>
    <p>The an­swer in many quar­ters was a re­sound­ing “business nearly as usual” with a to­tal of £3 bil­lion (S$5.3 bil­lion) be­ing spent on 1,344 deals in Europe’s big five leagues – Eng­land, France, Ger­many, Italy and Spain – ahead of the do­mes­tic-only dead­line. English Premier League teams can still buy and sell with their Cham­pi­onship coun­ter­parts un­til next Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Premier League once again ac­counted for the lion’s share with a value of around £1.45 bil­lion; Italy’s Serie A and Spain’s La Liga were a dis­tant sec­ond and third re­spec­tively with £797 mil­lion and £729 mil­lion spent.</p>
    <p>While the num­bers are still sig­nif­i­cant in the face of an eco­nomic cri­sis and many teams fur­lough­ing or re­trench­ing staff, it is still a huge de­crease on last year’s win­dow where com­bined spend­ing was £5.25 bil­lion, with the Premier</p>
    <p>League hit­ting £1.83 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>La Liga has seen the big­gest drop – not sur­pris­ing given its more strin­gent fi­nan­cial rules than the rest of Europe.</p>
    <p>With the im­pact of Covid-19, teams were forced to sell be­fore they could buy, lead­ing to Real Madrid de­cid­ing to not sign a sin­gle player de­spite shed­ding Gareth Bale, Achraf Hakimi, James Ro­driguez and Ser­gio Reguilon – with to­tal sales of nearly</p>
    <p>£90 mil­lion; while Barcelona’s in­com­ings were off­set by out­go­ing trans­fers.</p>
    <p>Ru­mours per­sist that both clubs are not just man­ag­ing costs this sea­son, but also have one eye on Paris Saint-Ger­main’s Kylian Mbappe next sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The huge out­lays of Chelsea, Manch­ester City, Liver­pool and even As­ton Villa and Leeds show that teams with wealthy own­ers are still able to spend, even in the face of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>But the lack of spend­ing by other teams was no­tice­able, with Chelsea spend­ing more than nine other Premier League teams com­bined: Brighton spent just £4.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>While own­ers like West Ham’s David Sul­li­van made a point that “we’ll prob­a­bly get no gate money for the rest of the sea­son and we’ve got to keep the club afloat and pay wages” for their lim­ited deal­ings, Arsenal stunned foot­ball by lay­ing off 55 staff – in­clud­ing their mas­cot of 23 years, Gun­ner­saurus – only to then pay a £45 mil­lion re­lease fee up­front for Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey.</p>
    <p>The Premier League sea­son has al­ready proved un­pre­dictable with last sea­son’s sur­vivors Villa now sec­ond in the ta­ble af­ter de­mol­ish­ing cham­pi­ons Liver­pool 7-2, just be­hind early front run­ners Ever­ton, who seem to have done very good business.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral teams seem not to have strength­ened key ar­eas suf­fi­ciently – City and Manch­ester United among them – while pun­dits and fans alike wait to see the im­pact of high-pro­file sign­ings like Thi­ago Al­can­tara, Kai Havertz, Bale and Edin­son Ca­vani.</p>
    <p>This sea­son, with its empty sta­di­ums, con­gested cal­en­dar and free-scor­ing start, may prove to be the most in­trigu­ing yet in Euro­pean foot­ball. But one thing is for sure: while money may be tight for some, for the bil­lion­aires who run the lead­ing clubs, this rep­re­sents an op­por­tu­nity to ex­ploit the cri­sis to find value, as they com­pete for the prize riches that await.</p>
    <p>The Premier League once again ac­counted for the lion’s share with a value of around £1.45 bil­lion; Italy’s Serie A and Spain’s La Liga were a dis­tant sec­ond and third re­spec­tively with £797 mil­lion and</p>
    <p>£729 mil­lion spent.</p>
