    <p>To pre­vent a spike in im­ported cases, those en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore with re­cent travel his­tory to Ja­pan, Hong Kong and the Aus­tralian state of Vic­to­ria will soon have to serve their stay-home no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity in­stead of at their own res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s tourism sec­tor re­ported steep de­clines in in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tor ar­rivals and tourism re­ceipts for the first quar­ter of this year amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Against the same pe­riod last year, in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors and tourism re­ceipts fell by 43.2 per cent and 39 per cent re­spec­tively, ac­cord­ing to a re­port re­leased by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This amounted to 2.7 mil­lion vis­i­tors in the first quar­ter, and $4 bil­lion in tourism re­ceipts.</p>
    <p>Jan­uary alone ac­counted for 1.69 mil­lion in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors, an in­crease from 1.62 mil­lion vis­i­tors in the same month last year.</p>
    <p>But ar­rivals plum­meted to 733,000 and 240,000 i n Fe­bru­ary and March re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore closed its bor­ders to all short-term vis­i­tors on March 23, in re­sponse to the es­ca­lat­ing global spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>It had ear­lier barred vis­i­tors from se­lected coun­tries that were hard-hit by the virus at the time.</p>
    <p>Tourists from In­done­sia, China, Aus­tralia, In­dia and Malaysia ac­counted for 49 per cent of all ar­rivals from Jan­uary to March.</p>
    <p>Of these coun­tries, tourists from China saw the sharpest de­cline, at 65 per cent, from last year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the fall in tourism re­ceipts was ob­served across all com­po­nents, in­clud­ing in ac­com­mo­da­tion, shop­ping and food and bev­er­age (F&B) spend­ing, STB said.</p>
    <p>Shop­ping saw the big­gest de­cline, fall­ing 52 per cent from the same pe­riod last year to $656 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>F&B spend­ing fell by 36 per cent to $376 mil­lion, while spend­ing on ac­com­mo­da­tion fell 31 per cent to $862 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing ex­pen­di­ture on sight­see­ing, en­ter­tain­ment and gam­ing, Sin­ga­pore’s top three tourist mar­kets i n the first quar­ter were China, In­done­sia and In­dia.</p>
    <p>STB said the sight­see­ing, en­ter­tain­ment and gam­ing com­po­nent was ex­cluded from the anal­y­sis due to the com­mer­cial sen­si­tiv­ity of the in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Tourism re­ceipts are ex­pected to fall even fur­ther in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, go­ing by more re­cent ar­rival data from the STB.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had just 750 vis­i­tors in April, while May was not much bet­ter with 880 vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has hit the tourism and avi­a­tion in­dus­tries par­tic­u­larly hard both lo­cally and glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Group recorded a 99.3 per cent year-onyear de­cline in pas­sen­ger car­riage last month, and is op­er­at­ing at ap­prox­i­mately 6 per cent of its sched­uled ca­pac­ity.</p>
