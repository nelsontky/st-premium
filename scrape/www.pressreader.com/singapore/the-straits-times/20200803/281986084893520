    <p>Ma­jor Neo Choon Chea will be mak­ing his de­but with the Red Lions sky­divers on Na­tional Day this year.</p>
    <p>He will be part of a six-per­son team land­ing near Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SKGH). Af­ter be­ing part of the ground co­or­di­nat­ing party in two pre­vi­ous Na­tional Day Pa­rades (NDPs), the 40-year-old said he was hon­oured to get his turn as a parachutis­t this year.</p>
    <p>The Red Lions will land in heart­land fields near SKGH and Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (NTFGH), which means smaller crowds on the ground but also a dif­fer­ent set of chal­lenges. This year’s jump is a 1,525m plunge from a Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force C-130 Her­cules air­craft, about half of the typ­i­cal free-fall dis­tance at NDPs.</p>
    <p>Back in 2018, the Red Lions jumped from a height of 3,810m.</p>
    <p>Jump­ing at a lower al­ti­tude re­duces wind drift, and with high-rise build­ings and ex­press­ways in the vicin­ity, the parachutis­ts need to be very pre­cise about where they drop, Maj Neo told the me­dia last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>It also means that the Red Lions will not be get­ting into their usual ring for­ma­tion, as they need to de­ploy their para­chutes soon af­ter they jump from the air­craft.</p>
    <p>“But this year... we will be fly­ing with the state flag and NDP ban­ners bear­ing the theme of unity,” added Maj Neo, who has 350 jumps un­der his belt.</p>
    <p>As part of the prepa­ra­tion be­fore the jump, the parachutis­ts do a men­tal re­hearsal on board the air­craft, he said, by vi­su­al­is­ing what they have to do: the leap from the C-130, open­ing the para­chute, de­ploy­ing the ban­ner and flag, and land­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Maj Neo, First War­rant Of­fi­cer Chew Eng Seng, 45, is also par­tic­i­pat­ing in the NDP as a Red Lion for the first time this year, as part of a six-per­son team land­ing near NTFGH.</p>
    <p>One of the parachutis­ts land­ing at Sengkang this year is Se­cond War­rant Of­fi­cer (2WO) Shirley Ng, 42.</p>
    <p>She is the only woman in the Red Lions and made her first pa­rade ap­pear­ance in 2014.</p>
    <p>While she was also part of the Red Lions team in 2013, that year’s jump did not hap­pen due to poor weather.</p>
    <p>Although the re­hearsals started a month later this year, in July, the parachutis­ts used a para­chute flight sim­u­la­tor to pre­pare prior to re­hearsals on-site.</p>
    <p>Com­par­ing the land­ing ex­pe­ri­ence this year to a pre­vi­ous jump at the Ma­rina Bay float­ing plat­form, 2WO Ng said: “In the heart­land, even though it’s not as rah-rah as usual... this jump is more for the front-line med­i­cal staff.</p>
    <p>“It’s about putting up a good show to give them moral sup­port.”</p>
    <p>But this does not mean that it is a quiet af­fair for the Red Lions, she added. “It has been a sur­prise that the res­i­dents over here, as we land, they are cheer­ing for us, wav­ing to us from their win­dows and bal­conies – it’s heart­warm­ing (to see).”</p>
    <p>Maj Neo, who is mar­ried with three daugh­ters, said that his fam­ily came to watch one of the re­hearsals in the middle of last month.</p>
    <p>But while hav­ing them wit­ness his para­chute feat is a nice bonus, “this jump is (re­ally) for the coun­try and for the front-line fight­ers”.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to a ban­ner put up by res­i­dents at the open field near SKGH, he said: “(They) put up a very lovely mes­sage for us, and we are re­ally touched and en­cour­aged by all th­ese ges­tures.”</p>
    <p>The Red Lions will be land­ing at open fields near SKGH and NTFGH, in Sengkang East Road and Toh Guan Road re­spec­tively, on Na­tional Day morn­ing.</p>
