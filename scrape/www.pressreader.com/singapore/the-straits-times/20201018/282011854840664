    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, who marked one month in of­fice on Fri­day, has in­curred the ire of the coun­try’s academia by re­ject­ing six out of 105 schol­ars nom­i­nated to a govern­ment ad­vi­sory panel.</p>
    <p>All six had been openly crit­i­cal of con­tro­ver­sial se­cu­rity and anti-con­spir­acy poli­cies pushed for by Mr Suga’s pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe, and their ex­clu­sion to the Sci­ence Coun­cil of Ja­pan is seen as a high-handed, vin­dic­tive act by the new Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, uni­ver­si­ties have also slammed a govern­ment ad­vi­sory ask­ing them to mourn the late prime min­is­ter Ya­suhiro Naka­sone, for whom a state funeral was held yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The twin moves have left a bit­ter taste, with Ky­oto Univer­sity pro­fes­sor Takeshi Ko­magome telling the Mainichi Shim­bun: “The Suga Cabi­net is try­ing to change Ja­pan’s regime into one where pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tions must com­ply with state or­ders.”</p>
    <p>There has been im­me­di­ate push­back. Pub­lic sup­port has fallen by 7 per­cent­age points from last month to 55 per cent, ac­cord­ing to an NHK poll last weekend. Nearly one in two re­spon­dents said the de­ci­sion on the coun­cil was un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>Small protests have bro­ken out through­out the coun­try. At least 370 aca­demic so­ci­eties and unions have crit­i­cised the re­jec­tion of the six schol­ars, while over 140,000 peo­ple have signed an on­line pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>No­bel physics lau­re­ate Toshi­hide Ma­sukawa con­demned the re­jec­tions as an act that “de­stroys democ­racy and con­sti­tu­tion­al­ism (and) is an in­sult to academia”.</p>
    <p>Film direc­tor Hirokazu Kore-eda, who won the Cannes Palme d’Or for his movie Sho­plifters (2018), signed a state­ment crit­i­cis­ing the act as a “vi­o­la­tion of the free­dom of ex­pres­sion and a clear chal­lenge to the free­dom of speech”.</p>
    <p>The Sci­ence Coun­cil of Ja­pan, founded in 1949 and funded by tax­pay­ers to the tune of 1 bil­lion yen (S$12.9 mil­lion) an­nu­ally, op­er­ates in­de­pen­dently and makes pol­icy rec­om­men­da­tions to the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>It com­prises 210 mem­bers serv­ing six-year terms, with half the group up for re­place­ment ev­ery three years.</p>
    <p>The duty of ap­point­ing the schol­ars is left to the prime min­is­ter, but it has for long been a rub­ber-stamp process, with the govern­ment au­tho­ris­ing names rec­om­mended by the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>In 1983, Mr Naka­sone, call­ing the process a “mere for­mal­ity”, said the govern­ment would not in­ter­fere in the se­lec­tion so as to “guar­an­tee aca­demic free­dom and in­de­pen­dence”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Suga has ripped up this play­book by ques­tion­ing the blind fol­low­ing of prece­dence, and ask­ing if it was even ap­pro­pri­ate to use pub­lic funds for the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports have pounced on the twists and turns of the un­fold­ing saga. Mr Suga said the list he saw con­sisted of only 99 names, but he could not an­swer when, who or why the other six names were scrubbed out.</p>
    <p>SAGA SET TO BE DRAWN-OUT</p>
    <p>And while he in­sists that their re­jec­tions have noth­ing to do with their po­lit­i­cal be­liefs, he has also said it was nec­es­sary to se­cure a “com­pre­hen­sive and bird’s-eye view of the coun­cil’s ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>Coun­cil pres­i­dent Takaaki Ka­jita, who won the No­bel Prize in physics in 2015, has called on the govern­ment to ap­point the six schol­ars – and if not, to pro­vide a clear ex­pla­na­tion why they were re­jected if in­deed not for their po­lit­i­cal be­liefs.</p>
    <p>Kobe Col­lege pro­fes­sor emer­i­tus Tat­suru Uchida told the Asahi Shim­bun: “If ad­min­is­tra­tions get in­volved with aca­demic com­mu­ni­ties and gather ‘yes-men’ based on their loy­al­ties, there will be fewer op­pos­ing voices, mak­ing it eas­ier for politi­cians to man­age them.”</p>
    <p>Still, the pro-govern­ment Sankei Shim­bun has come to a staunch de­fence of the govern­ment, say­ing it was nat­u­ral for the out­dated Sci­ence Coun­cil to be re­formed.</p>
    <p>The news­pa­per, in two ed­i­to­ri­als last week, slammed the body for re­ject­ing mil­i­tary re­search. “As the se­cu­rity en­vi­ron­ment con­tin­ues to de­te­ri­o­rate, the Sci­ence Coun­cil, which con­tin­ues to deny de­fence re­search that can pro­tect the lives and safety of the peo­ple, is detri­men­tal to our na­tional in­ter­ests,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mock­ing the saga as be­ing much ado about noth­ing, Sankei Shim­bun ar­gued: “Not be­ing ap­pointed to the Sci­ence Coun­cil does not ren­der aca­demics in­ca­pable of do­ing their own re­search, and there­fore there is no clam­p­down on aca­demic free­doms.”</p>
    <p>Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano said it does not bode well for the Suga ad­min­is­tra­tion to be en­veloped in con­tro­versy so soon af­ter tak­ing of­fice. “It will be nearly im­pos­si­ble for him to turn a new page quickly be­cause he re­ally has gal­vanised the whole academia,” he told The Sun­day Times. “The schol­ars are not go­ing to back down and this will drag out for a long time... which could hurt him in elec­tions due next year.”</p>
