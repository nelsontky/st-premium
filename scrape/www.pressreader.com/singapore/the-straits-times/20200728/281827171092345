    <p>BEI­JING • China’s thou­sands of state-owned en­ter­prises (SOEs), lo­cal gov­ern­ments and pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions are ex­pand­ing hir­ing as a record num­ber of stu­dents grad­u­ate into a job mar­ket left reel­ing by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Around 8.7 mil­lion Chi­nese stu­dents are grad­u­at­ing this year, al­most half a mil­lion more than last year, and are head­ing into an un­cer­tain fu­ture as pri­vate com­pa­nies rein in re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>Job sta­bil­ity for the young is a long­stand­ing po­lit­i­cal con­cern in China. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, who has pre­vi­ously warned that strug­gling grad­u­ates could “turn into neg­a­tive en­ergy”, is urg­ing more hir­ing.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ates, who gen­er­ally en­ter the work­force in June or July, face a “se­vere” sit­u­a­tion, of­fi­cials have said. The num­ber of avail­able po­si­tions for them in the re­cent pre­grad­u­a­tion spring re­cruit­ing sea­son fell by 22 per cent on year, ac­cord­ing to BOSS Zhipin Re­search.</p>
    <p>While China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct bounced back into growth in the sec­ond quar­ter, sur­veyed un­em­ploy­ment of grad­u­ates aged 20 to 24 was more than three times the rate for the broader pop­u­la­tion, ris­ing to 19.3 per cent in June, 2.1 per­cent­age points higher than May.</p>
    <p>SOEs, lo­cal gov­ern­ments and pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions, known col­lec­tively as “the sys­tem”, are re­spond­ing to Mr Xi’s call.</p>
    <p>Oil gi­ant Sinopec Corp is more than dou­bling its 2020 re­cruit­ment num­bers, with an ad­di­tional 3,500 po­si­tions for new grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>In cen­tral He­nan province, pro­vin­cial SOEs have been told to ex­pand hir­ing and re­serve at least half the new po­si­tions for grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, ini­tia­tives such as this run counter to the idea that China’s SOEs are run on a purely com­mer­cial ba­sis,” said Mr Louis Kuijs of Ox­ford Eco­nomics. SOEs, which en­joy priv­i­leged ac­cess to cer­tain sec­tors, have a “spe­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity” at times, he noted.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment schemes send­ing youth to work in less de­vel­oped ar­eas of China have also been bulked up: one, where grad­u­ates help with poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and other forms of com­mu­nity sup­port, has 5,000 more places than last year.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands more grad­u­ates than in 2019 will be granted pass­ing grades in the highly com­pet­i­tive civil ser­vice ex­ams, mainly held in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts to di­rectly soak up labour are lim­ited as China’s pri­vate sec­tor ac­counts for 80 per cent of ur­ban jobs. But SOEs have also been told to help em­ploy­ment in­di­rectly by promptly pay­ing and re­duc­ing costs for smaller com­pa­nies, said Mr An­drew Polk, a part­ner at Triv­ium China, a re­search ad­vi­sory.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter dated July 7 to grad­u­ates em­bark­ing on grass­roots work in the far-western re­gion of Xin­jiang, Mr Xi said he wanted de­gree hold­ers to “con­trib­ute more to the (Chi­nese Com­mu­nist) Party, the moth­er­land and the peo­ple”.</p>
