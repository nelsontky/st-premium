    <p>Many gov­ern­ments and, in­deed, pub­lic opin­ion in some coun­tries are trending to­wards the re­lax­ation of the use and le­gal­i­sa­tion of cannabis.</p>
    <p>Pro­po­nents of le­gal­is­ing mar­i­juana are mak­ing great ef­fort to be con­vinc­ing in their nar­ra­tives on the sup­posed ad­van­tages of the med­i­cal and recre­ational use of the drug. The lat­est devel­op­ment is the re­cent de­ci­sion by the United Na­tions Com­mis­sion on Nar­cotic Drugs to re­clas­sify cannabis as a less dan­ger­ous drug.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Home Af­fairs did not sup­port this, is­su­ing a state­ment that this move could “fuel pub­lic mis­per­cep­tion, es­pe­cially among youth, that cannabis is no longer con­sid­ered to be as harm­ful as be­fore, de­spite strong ev­i­dence show­ing oth­er­wise”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau’s web­site on Sin­ga­pore’s Anti-Drug Laws on Cannabis, the pos­ses­sion or con­sump­tion of cannabis can be pun­ished by up to 10 years’ jail or a $20,000 fine, or both. De­pend­ing on the amount of cannabis, those caught for the il­le­gal traffic, im­port or ex­port of the drug can face the death penalty.</p>
    <p>As a for­mer drug ad­dict, I am glad that the Gov­ern­ment is stead­fast in hold­ing Sin­ga­pore’s zero-tol­er­ance stance to­wards drugs.</p>
    <p>MY STORY</p>
    <p>I am nei­ther a doc­tor nor a clin­i­cian. I am a busi­ness­man; as part of my per­sonal so­cial in­tent, I speak on anti-drug abuse is­sues and af­ter­care re­cov­ery is­sues fac­ing for­mer of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>My first use of drugs was at the age of 13 with MX pills, a sleep­ing pill favoured by ad­dicts in the 1970s be­cause it put them in a trance. Soon af­ter, I was mix­ing it up with mar­i­juana and heroin. This ru­ined seven years of my youth – I would de­scribe it as liv­ing in hell with con­stant night­mares.</p>
    <p>I al­ways needed money for drugs, and lived in con­stant fear of be­ing ar­rested for drug use or for steal­ing and rob­bing to buy drugs.</p>
    <p>I was dif­fi­cult to get along with be­cause of my volatile moods, and my fam­ily bore the brunt of it. In an ad­dict’s life, it is al­ways and only about you, and you couldn’t care less about any­one else.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 1977, I was buy­ing heroin when anti-drug of­fi­cers ar­rested me. Ter­ri­fied, I prayed to God: “Please don’t let my urine test be pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>I was in to­tal dis­be­lief when the re­sult turned out neg­a­tive, but I em­braced this as a per­sonal mir­a­cle – the defin­ing mo­ment that led me to sal­vage my life and al­ter my destiny.</p>
    <p>I count my­self very for­tu­nate that I was spared con­vic­tion, im­pris­on­ment and pos­si­ble death from us­ing drugs. In the 42 years since then, I have lived a mean­ing­ful and fruit­ful life.</p>
    <p>LES­SONS FROM DRUG ABUSE</p>
    <p>Here, I will look at the is­sue of recre­ational drug use based on my ex­pe­ri­ence as a for­mer drug ad­dict.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber last year, at the in­vi­ta­tion of the Na­tional Coun­cil Against Drug Abuse, I at­tended the Asia-Pa­cific Fo­rum Against Drugs held in Sin­ga­pore. Lots of in­sights were shared on the re­lax­ation of the use and le­gal­i­sa­tion of cannabis.</p>
    <p>In some coun­tries, there has been a pro­lif­er­a­tion of mar­i­juana re­tail out­lets (by the thou­sands), in­clud­ing the sale of mar­i­juana-in­fused prod­ucts such as cook­ies, can­dies, choco­lates, cook­ing oil, but­ter, drinks and bev­er­ages. This made me won­der: What­ever hap­pened to cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity?</p>
    <p>I hope that Sin­ga­pore will never come to such a state.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been an ad­dict dur­ing the drug epi­demic in Sin­ga­pore in the 1970s, I find these lat­est de­vel­op­ments wor­ry­ing. Mar­i­juana should never be treated lightly, as a be­nign sub­stance that is less dan­ger­ous and fit for recre­ational use. I have not heard of any deaths aris­ing from a mar­i­juana over­dose, but the drug un­de­ni­ably af­fects one’s body and mind.</p>
    <p>On many oc­ca­sions in the past, when I was high on mar­i­juana, I would lose my co­or­di­na­tion, and my vi­sion, hear­ing and mem­ory would be af­fected.</p>
    <p>I would al­most al­ways find bruises, abra­sions and cuts on my body and not re­mem­ber how I got them – I must have bumped into or tripped over some­thing, or walked into a drain. I also had some near misses of be­ing hit by ve­hi­cles while walk­ing on the road.</p>
    <p>One in­ci­dent I do re­mem­ber: I had camped overnight with some friends at East Coast beach for pot or mar­i­juana ses­sions. My three friends and I started our first ses­sion while wait­ing for an­other two to join us. The tide was high that night – and so were we.</p>
    <p>Af­ter some time, I jumped into the sea for no ap­par­ent rea­son. At that mo­ment, the two other friends ar­rived. Know­ing that I could not swim, they jumped into the wa­ter and pulled me out.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, I started us­ing mar­i­juana as a “fash­ion state­ment”, to be part of the life­style culture of the hippy era. Pot be­came a cool recre­ational drug for cel­e­bra­tions, es­pe­cially dur­ing Christ­mas and New Year.</p>
    <p>Although I was not de­pen­dent on the drug at first, I be­gan yearn­ing for it, con­stantly think­ing about the “high” it would give me. My fre­quency of use in­creased from par­ties and the like, to ev­ery week­end, and then to ev­ery other day. I re­alised then I was de­pen­dent on it.</p>
    <p>As you can de­velop a tol­er­ance to mar­i­juana, you will even­tu­ally need to take more to get that sim­i­lar level of high. This is when it be­comes an ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>MISPERCEPT­IONS</p>
    <p>Le­gal­i­sa­tion and re­lax­ation ef­forts have caused some peo­ple to mis­per­ceive that mar­i­juana is safe and harm­less.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, it is this mis­per­cep­tion that makes mar­i­juana one of the most dif­fi­cult drugs to break away from. This cava­lier at­ti­tude can lead to a psy­cho­log­i­cal ad­dic­tion. Open­ing the gate of ac­ces­si­bil­ity through le­gal­i­sa­tion can ex­ac­er­bate that ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>I see the young as most sus­cep­ti­ble to this mis­per­cep­tion, as they might see the use of the drug as be­ing cool and the “in” thing to do.</p>
    <p>An­other group of youth that is cause for con­cern is those who treat drug use as just a fun recre­ational ac­tiv­ity, or see them­selves as in­vin­ci­ble and able to take risks. Mis­guid­edly, they be­lieve that they will never be in harm’s way, or that they can out­wit drug de­pen­dency at will.</p>
    <p>A friend once asked me for my opin­ion on a young woman who had just come out of prison. Her hus­band had filed for di­vorce, di­vided what­ever they had equally, and he was get­ting cus­tody of their child.</p>
    <p>The woman, who had been to prison sev­eral times although she was only in her late 20s, posed this ques­tion to my friend: “Why can’t our Gov­ern­ment le­galise mar­i­juana like ev­ery­body else?” She also said she planned to im­mi­grate to a neigh­bour­ing coun­try that had le­galised mar­i­juana.</p>
    <p>I learnt that she had been on drugs such as metham­phetamine and heroin in ad­di­tion to mar­i­juana. This made clear to me what her ques­tion was re­ally about: She saw the le­gal­is­ing of mar­i­juana as the start of the re­lax­ation of laws on drug use in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>Even if the po­tency of a dan­ger­ous drug is triv­i­alised, or a suc­cess­ful with­drawal from phys­i­cal ad­dic­tion is seem­ingly achiev­able, as is the case with mar­i­juana use, we can­not down­play the psy­cho­log­i­cal ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Drugs silently hi­jack one’s brain and af­fect one’s qual­ity of life in nu­mer­ous ways. Like the case of that young woman – her de­pen­dence on drugs meant it had al­ways and only been about her, lead­ing to the break-up of her fam­ily, and the loss of her hus­band and child.</p>
    <p>As drug abuse af­fects the young es­pe­cially, the fu­ture of the coun­try is also at stake. Mak­ing mar­i­juana le­gal would lead to more young drug abusers, caus­ing much harm and mis­ery. Re­lax­ing the rules on drug use is not only un­wise, but will im­pact the coun­try’s suc­cess in years to come.</p>
    <p>I urge all not to adopt a cava­lier and counter-culture at­ti­tude to­wards drug use, as this will only bring grave con­se­quences. What we need in­stead is a pre­ven­tive, pro­tec­tive and col­lec­tive mind­set. I speak, un­for­tu­nately, from ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Even if the po­tency of a dan­ger­ous drug is triv­i­alised, or a suc­cess­ful with­drawal from phys­i­cal ad­dic­tion is seem­ingly achiev­able, as is the case with mar­i­juana use, we can­not down­play the psy­cho­log­i­cal ad­dic­tion. Drugs silently hi­jack one’s brain and af­fect one’s qual­ity of life in nu­mer­ous ways.</p>
