    <p>Ninety-five more for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries have been cleared of Covid-19 as of yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>This brings the total cleared to 975 dor­mi­to­ries and 64 blocks for re­cov­ered work­ers in 17 pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, about 262,000 work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries ei­ther have re­cov­ered or been tested and found to be free of the virus as of Tues­day. This rep­re­sents more than 80 per cent of the 323,000 dorm res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>The 95 newly cleared dor­mi­to­ries com­prise one pur­pose-built dor­mi­tory, 78 fac­tory-con­verted dor­mi­to­ries and 16 con­struc­tion tem­po­rary quar­ters.</p>
    <p>An­other 12 blocks for re­cov­ered work­ers in six pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries were cleared, said MOM.</p>
    <p>These in­clude a block in Kian Teck Hos­tel, mak­ing the hos­tel the 17th pur­pose-built dorm to be cleared out of 43 such dorms in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Kian Teck Hos­tel has also met MOM’s con­di­tions for its res­i­dents to re­sume work. These con­di­tions en­tail ar­rang­ing stag­gered pick-up and drop-off tim­ings be­tween em­ploy­ers and dor­mi­tory operators and the con­fir­ma­tion of work­ers’ res­i­den­tial ad­dresses on the MOM data­base.</p>
    <p>Work­ers must also down­load FWMOMCare app to up­date their health and res­i­den­tial sta­tus, and down­load TraceTo­gether to fa­cil­i­tate con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>MOM added that many of the 262,000 who have re­cov­ered or been tested and found to be free of the virus are stay­ing in cleared dorms, and can re­sume work as soon as these con­di­tions are met.</p>
    <p>The multi-min­istry task force com­bat­ing the Covid-19 out­break said last Fri­day that all mi­grant worker dorms will be cleared of the virus by Aug 7. The only ex­cep­tions are 17 stand­alone blocks in eight pur­pose-built dorms that will serve as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties for 28,000 work­ers still serv­ing out their iso­la­tion pe­riod.</p>
