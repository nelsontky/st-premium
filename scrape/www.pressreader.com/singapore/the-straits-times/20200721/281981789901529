    <p>Last month, my wife and I planned our first hol­i­day in six months. It was a hec­tic ex­pe­ri­ence. Bor­ders between most Aus­tralian states had been closed since the start of the coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>We’d been hop­ing to fly three hours to the trop­i­cal re­sort town of Cairns, in Queens­land, to es­cape the Syd­ney win­ter.</p>
    <p>Within hours of the an­nounce­ment that Queens­land’s bor­der would open, tick­ets for the few flights north started sell­ing out. With so few seats avail­able, yield man­age­ment – the prac­tice by which air­lines mon­i­tor minute-by-minute de­mand for their seats, and raise prices ac­cord­ingly – was in over­drive.</p>
    <p>By the time we fi­nally booked, we’d spent about A$1,000 (S$972), or 40 per cent, more than if we’d been quicker off the mark.</p>
    <p>That’s a glimpse of what awaits trav­ellers as the world comes out of Covid-19-in­duced hi­ber­na­tion over the next two years. Global air traf­fic is fore­cast to fall by at least half this year. Most air­lines be­lieve busi­ness won’t re­turn to pre-pan­demic lev­els un­til 2023, at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial con­se­quences for large car­ri­ers and their em­ploy­ees will be wrench­ing – and those pas­sen­gers who do start fly­ing again will have to bear the costs.</p>
    <p>The drawn-out re­cov­ery will ac­cen­tu­ate all the as­pects of fly­ing that trav­ellers be­moan. Did you think travel last year was costly, crowded, mean and lack­ing in glam­our? Get used to it.</p>
    <p>The de­cline of busi­ness travel poses the big­gest threat to the in­dus­try. Premium-class trav­ellers ac­count for about 5 per cent of traf­fic but 30 per cent of air­line rev­enue, al­low­ing car­ri­ers to of­fer econ­omy seats at cheaper fares.</p>
    <p>Tight cor­po­rate bud­gets and the boom in video­con­fer­enc­ing un­der lock­down may have killed off a size­able share of that in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Some 60 per cent of travel man­agers sur­veyed by BCD Travel in April ex­pect the fre­quency of busi­ness travel to be lower even af­ter the pan­demic sub­sides. Of all econ­omy and premium-class tick­ets bought by busi­nesses, “10 per cent to 15 per cent will never re­turn”, said Mr Ben Bal­danza, for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of bud­get car­rier Spirit Air­lines. “Video was avail­able be­fore Covid-19, but now busi­nesses have both ex­pe­ri­ence and con­fi­dence in us­ing it.”</p>
    <p>Re­ces­sions typ­i­cally lead to a three-year slump in air travel – and the one we’re see­ing is likely to be un­prece­dented in its depth and length. Long-haul op­er­a­tions could still be strug­gling five years from now, ac­cord­ing to Mr Bal­danza.</p>
    <p>THE LIKELY SUR­VIVORS</p>
    <p>The early days of re­cov­ery may bring bar­gains as car­ri­ers try to coax pas­sen­gers back on board. But sooner or later, the in­dus­try will have to reckon with the moun­tain of debt its taken on. There’s sim­ply no flight map for this.</p>
    <p>Firms with net debts more than about four or five times the size of their Ebitda (earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, tax, de­pre­ci­a­tion and amor­ti­sa­tion) are con­ven­tion­ally con­sid­ered at high risk of miss­ing pay­ments. That ra­tio will hit 16 for the global air­line in­dus­try next year, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Some car­ri­ers will be able to with­stand the cri­sis bet­ter than oth­ers. Those with strong po­si­tions in large do­mes­tic mar­kets that have been spared the worst of the virus – such as Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and China – should do bet­ter, as will re­gional Asian car­ri­ers and bud­get air­lines in the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of their low-cost bases, short-haul dis­count car­ri­ers are likely to be more re­silient than their full-ser­vice ri­vals. Air­lines based in large do­mes­tic mar­kets hit hard­est by Covid-19 – the United States, In­dia, Brazil, Rus­sia – will find the go­ing harder. The worst af­fected are likely to be the hand­ful of air­lines that spent the past two decades as­pir­ing to con­nect the world as global hub car­ri­ers. The sort of long-haul con­nect­ing traf­fic that the likes of Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways, Emi­rates, Eti­had Air­ways and Qatar Air­ways spe­cialise in won’t look like a vi­able busi­ness for many years.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately for their em­ploy­ees and pas­sen­gers, all ex­cept Cathay have con­trol­ling state share­hold­ers who see flag-car­ry­ing air­lines as fun­da­men­tal to their eco­nomic fu­tures. The state’s role will be im­pos­si­ble to es­cape in the decade ahead. Al­ready, gov­ern­ments have ex­tended some US$123 bil­lion (S$171 bil­lion) of aid – equiv­a­lent to the last four years’ worth of in­dus­try prof­its. The dam­age that Covid-19 is do­ing to traf­fic and the cen­tral­ity of quar­an­tine mea­sures mean that only a hand­ful of mainly bud­get car­ri­ers are likely to sur­vive on their own feet.</p>
    <p>Many air­lines will need on­go­ing state sup­port, on top of the bailouts that have al­ready taken place.</p>
    <p>Car­ri­ers that don’t re­ceive gov­ern­ment back­ing will head to­wards bank­ruptcy. Those that do get help still risk end­ing up in the po­si­tion of scle­rotic state-owned flag-car­ri­ers like Al­i­talia, Malaysia Air­lines and Air In­dia, lurch­ing from cri­sis to cri­sis un­der the weight of gov­ern­ment loans. That will trans­late into un­pleas­ant ex­pe­ri­ences for pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>PACKED PLANES, HIGHER FEES</p>
    <p>You’re un­likely to find your­self sur­rounded by so­cially-dis­tanced empty seats – even easyJet, which pro­posed that mea­sure in April, later dropped it. Air­lines at the best of times can’t make money un­less they fill 80 per cent of the plane. On the first leg of my flight from Syd­ney to Bris­bane, every one of the 174 seats on board was oc­cu­pied. Your best hope of avoid­ing in­fec­tion will be ei­ther to wear a mask, to count on the re­li­a­bil­ity of in-cabin air filtration or to avoid fly­ing al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Car­ri­ers will am­plify the ex­ist­ing trend to­wards mak­ing money in ar­eas where pas­sen­gers seem in­sen­si­tive to price – in other words, every­thing but the tick­ets them­selves. An­cil­lary rev­enues from things like bag­gage fees, ex­tra legroom, on-board meals, fre­quent-flier points and ho­tel and car rental book­ings have risen five­fold over the past decade to hit US$109.5 bil­lion last year, ac­cord­ing to con­sul­tants IdeaWork­sCom­pany.</p>
    <p>That’s more than 12 per cent of over­all air­line rev­enues and at some dis­count car­ri­ers it amounts to as much as a third of the to­tal.</p>
    <p>The af­ter­math of the pan­demic will pro­vide car­ri­ers with a rea­son to stop hand­ing out free food and drink that could be seen as car­ry­ing in­fec­tion. They’ll come at­tached with a stiff price tag in fu­ture. Bag­gage fees will also soar.</p>
    <p>The bright­est spot in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try at the mo­ment is freight. Be­cause of the short­age of pas­sen­ger flights, cargo holds are fuller than they’ve ever been, al­low­ing car­ri­ers to push up prices.</p>
    <p>Lug­gage fees are a way of both earn­ing ex­tra rev­enue in the pas­sen­ger cabin and dis­cour­ag­ing peo­ple from bring­ing bags, free­ing up more space be­low decks for prof­itable com­mer­cial ship­ments.</p>
    <p>As for seats, pas­sen­ger groups be­lieve a re­view of seat size due to be re­leased this sum­mer by the US Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion will give car­ri­ers the green light to pack peo­ple even closer to­gether.</p>
    <p>On a typ­i­cal Air­bus SE A-320 or Boe­ing 737, each cen­time­tre taken off legroom could open up space for an ex­tra row of pas­sen­gers, up to max­i­mum lev­els de­ter­mined by evac­u­a­tion pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>The car­ri­ers that sur­vive will have more mar­ket power, thanks to the col­lapse or takeover of their ri­vals, putting them in a good po­si­tion to squeeze out the higher fares they’ll need to pay off their debts.</p>
    <p>Will reg­u­la­tors come to the res­cue of con­sumers, by pre­vent­ing fur­ther air­line con­sol­i­da­tion? Don’t count on it. But that largesse that gov­ern­ments are giv­ing away shouldn’t come for free, ei­ther.</p>
    <p>Two types of air­line busi­nesses are likely to pros­per in the decade ahead: Lean bud­get car­ri­ers like Ryanair and South­west Air­lines, and gov­ern­ment-con­trolled, bailed-out, long-haul na­tional cham­pi­ons like Emi­rates and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines.</p>
    <p>For most pas­sen­gers, that means a fu­ture with fewer cross-con­ti­nen­tal flights be­ing pam­pered on the up­per deck of a jumbo jet, and more time crammed into nar­row seats eat­ing dry sand­wiches and sip­ping US$10 cans of beer.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try that emerges from the coro­n­avirus will be nasty, brutish and short-haul.</p>
