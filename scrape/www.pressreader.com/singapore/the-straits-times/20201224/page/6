• People who want to collect their tokens before distributi­on starts in their district can visit any active collection site to do so. If I collect the TraceToget­her token, do I still need the TraceToget­her app?
• You can use either the app or the token.
• The token is designed for people who do not want to install the TraceToget­her app, or are not comfortabl­e using a smartphone. Is my token waterproof? • The token is water-resistant but not waterproof. • Treat it as you would treat your mobile phone – do not drop it from a height, immerse it in water, or place it near fire. What do I do if I have lost my token? What if the token is damaged? • You can get it replaced at any community centre or club where token distributi­on has started.
• If you have lost your token, you will not be charged for the first replacemen­t. Source: SMART NATION AND DIGITAL GOVERNMENT GROUP ST PHOTOS: GAVIN FOO STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS SIZE COMPARISON Latest design Width: 45mm Height: 62mm Thickness: 22mm NOTE: Sizes are approximat­es. 6
