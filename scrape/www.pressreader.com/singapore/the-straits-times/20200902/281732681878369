    <p>Es­sen­tial travel be­tween Brunei and Sin­ga­pore has been made pos­si­ble fol­low­ing agree­ments by both coun­tries to es­tab­lish re­cip­ro­cal green lane fa­cil­i­ties at both ends.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cur­rently has sim­i­lar ar­range­ments in place with China and Malaysia, and is dis­cussing adding other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Ja­pan, to the list.</p>
    <p>Such tie-ups are a crit­i­cal part of the Repub­lic’s strat­egy to slowly re­vive air travel so that more eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties can re­sume.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for Sin­ga­poreBrunei travel opened yes­ter­day, with trav­ellers re­quired to ob­serve some con­di­tions in­clud­ing con­trolled itin­er­ar­ies, a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test prior to the trip and a swab test on ar­rival at their des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment, the For­eign Af­fairs min­istries of Sin­ga­pore and Brunei said: “Both sides have agreed on an ar­range­ment to al­low the safe re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der move­ment of a lim­ited num­ber of peo­ple, with nec­es­sary safe­guards in place to en­sure the pub­lic health con­cerns of both coun­tries are ad­dressed.”</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the mul­ti­min­istry Covid-19 task force, had an­nounced on Aug 21 that cer­tain pro­vi­sions were be­ing made to al­low leisure vis­i­tors from Brunei and New Zealand to visit Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Those who have re­mained in either coun­try in the last 14 con­sec­u­tive days prior to their visit to Sin­ga­pore will not have to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice here. In­stead, they will un­dergo a Covid-19 test upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>For the new es­sen­tial travel pro­gramme, those trav­el­ling from Sin­ga­pore to Brunei must get the govern­ment agency in Brunei or the com­pany spon­sor­ing the travel to ap­ply for an En­try Travel Pass on their be­half.</p>
    <p>The trav­eller’s con­trolled itin­er­ary in Brunei for the first 14 days must be submitted. When the En­try Travel Pass is granted, an ap­proval let­ter will be is­sued.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar ap­proval process ap­plies for trav­ellers com­ing to Sin­ga­pore from Brunei.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore and Brunei must have re­mained in their re­spec­tive coun­tries for at least 14 days be­fore de­par­ture and un­der­take a Covid-19 test within 72 hours be­fore the flight.</p>
    <p>Those go­ing to Brunei have to down­load the BruHealth mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion prior to their de­par­ture from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They will be re­quired to pro­duce the ap­proved En­try Travel Pass, neg­a­tive re­sults of a Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours be­fore de­par­ture, a valid re­turn air ticket, valid proof of pay­ment for the post-ar­rival swab test and a valid visa for visa-re­quired pass­port hold­ers.</p>
    <p>They may not be al­lowed to board oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar mea­sures are in place for trav­ellers com­ing to Sin­ga­pore from Brunei. All trav­ellers from Brunei and Sin­ga­pore will bear the cost of their pre-de­par­ture Covid-19 swab tests.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers ar­riv­ing in Brunei from Sin­ga­pore are re­quired to un­der­take a Covid-19 swab test while in iso­la­tion at a pre-de­clared ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Trans­port from the air­port to the de­clared ac­com­mo­da­tion will be pro­vided by the Brunei govern­ment agency or com­pany spon­sor­ing the travel, sub­ject to pre­vail­ing health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers will bear the costs of their stay in the de­clared lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>If the test re­sult is pos­i­tive, the trav­eller will be given med­i­cal treat­ment by the Brunei govern­ment. The trav­eller will bear the cost of med­i­cal treat­ment in Brunei.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures are sim­i­lar for trav­ellers ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore from Brunei.</p>
