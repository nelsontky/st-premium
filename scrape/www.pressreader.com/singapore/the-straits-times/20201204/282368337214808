    <p>Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player (MVP) LeBron James, who will turn 36 later this month, has agreed on a twoyear, US$85 mil­lion (S$113.6 mil­lion) con­tract ex­ten­sion with the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, his agent Rich Paul said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion means James will make US$39.2 mil­lion next season and will be a Laker through the 2022-23 season, ESPN re­ported.</p>
    <p>He will also earn US$41.1 mil­lion in 2021-22 and US$44.5 mil­lion in 2022-23 and by the time his con­tract ends, he will have played two decades in the NBA.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion also opens up the pos­si­bil­ity of the four-time NBA cham­pion play­ing with his el­dest son. Bronny, 16, will grad­u­ate from high school in 2023, and with NBA com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver set to al­low high school players to be di­rectly drafted rather than re­quir­ing them to play in col­lege by 2022, there is a chance the guard, who is con­sid­ered an “elite tal­ent”, could be on the same team as his dad.</p>
    <p>James putting pen to pa­per also sig­nals his con­fi­dence that the Lak­ers can break out of a tie with the Bos­ton Celtics and win a record 18th cham­pi­onship this up­com­ing season.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with the Road Trippin’ pod­cast ear­lier this week, the for­ward said: “We can (re­peat the win). I mean, it’s that sim­ple.</p>
    <p>“We ab­so­lutely can... First of all, it all starts with health. You have to have some luck. You have to have health. If we can stay healthy.”</p>
    <p>Part of his be­lief stems from their shrewd post-season ac­qui­si­tions, namely Den­nis Schroder, 27, Mon­trezl Har­rell, 26, and Marc Ga­sol, 35.</p>
    <p>“We did get younger,” James said. “We have a 27-year-old point guard. We got the 26-year-old Sixth Man of the Year award in Trezz. We got younger.</p>
    <p>“We got Marc, who is a (former) De­fen­sive Player of the Year and his IQ, not only play­ing against him in the NBA, but also play­ing against him ver­sus Spain with the na­tional team.”</p>
    <p>The four-time MVP also hinted the Lak­ers were look­ing at re-sign­ing guard Quinn Cook, who is cur­rently a free agent, and even pos­si­bly reuniting the Ga­sol broth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Quinn, he’s a pro, he’s def­i­nitely go­ing to get a look,” he said. “Hope­fully back with us.... Hope­fully, we may bring him back.”</p>
    <p>On 40-year-old Pau, who is an­other free agent and was part of the Lak­ers team who won ti­tles in 2009 and 2010, he added: “We’ll see. We’ll see, I mean, maybe. We’ll see. We’ll see.”</p>
    <p>Last season, James av­er­aged 25.3 points and led the NBA in as­sists with 10.2 per game.</p>
    <p>He be­came the first player in NBA his­tory to win the Fi­nals MVP award with three dif­fer­ent teams as the Lak­ers beat the Mi­ami Heat in six games in the ti­tle de­cider in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>He will en­ter his 18th NBA season in 2020-21 ranked third on the NBA’s all-time scor­ing list with 34,241 points, be­hind only Karl Malone (36,928) and Ka­reem Ab­dul-Jab­bar (38,387).</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers will bat­tle the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers on Dec 22 to open the season, with the cham­pi­onship ring cer­e­mony also held on the same night.</p>
    <p>The other open­ing night game fea­tures the Golden State War­riors at the Brook­lyn Nets, who are ex­pected to name former War­rior Kevin Du­rant in their start­ing lineup for the first time since June last year when he rup­tured his Achilles ten­don.</p>
    <p>FIT­NESS IS KEY</p>
    <p>We can (re­peat the win). It’s that sim­ple. We ab­so­lutely can... First of all, it all starts with health. You have to have some luck. You have to have health.</p>
    <p>LEBRON JAMES, Los An­ge­les Lak­ers for­ward, on the team’s chances of an 18th cham­pi­onship this season.</p>
