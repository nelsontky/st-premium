    <p>In­done­sia has be­gun talks with of­fi­cials from US phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer to se­cure the Pfiz­erBioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine to en­sure suf­fi­cient sup­plies prior to a mas­sive roll-out of a vac­ci­na­tion drive next year in the world’s fourth most pop­u­lous coun­try.</p>
    <p>The talks in­volved the Health Min­istry ear­lier this week and will con­tinue next week with of­fi­cials from BPOM, In­done­sia’s equiv­a­lent of the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion, two gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials said on con­di­tion of anonymity. “Pfizer of­fered to help pro­vide the re­quired cold­chain fa­cil­ity to en­sure proper dis­tri­bu­tion of its vac­cines,” one of­fi­cial told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Un­like most vac­cines, which need to be kept at nor­mal re­frig­er­ated tem­per­a­tures of be­tween 2 deg C and 8 deg C, the Pfiz­erBioNTech vac­cine must be stored at ul­tra cold tem­per­a­tures of mi­nus 70 deg C, thus re­quir­ing spe­cial freez­ers. In reg­u­lar re­frig­er­a­tors, it can be kept for up to only five days. The firms are seek­ing to cre­ate a sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion ver­sion of their two-dose reg­i­men that can with­stand warmer tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>A few days after re­turn­ing from a visit to the US, In­done­sia’s Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter Luhut Pand­jai­tan said on Tues­day that US Vi­cePres­i­dent Mike Pence had of­fered “joint co­op­er­a­tion in vac­cine pro­duc­tion be­tween Amer­i­can and In­done­sian com­pa­nies”.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has re­ported a to­tal of 522,581 Covid-19 cases as of yes­ter­day, with 16,521 deaths. Both fig­ures are the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has, so far, se­cured com­mit­ments for the ship­ment of 189 mil­lion vac­cine doses from China’s Si­no­vac, Mary­land-based No­vavax and Co­vax, an in­ter­na­tional Covid-19 vac­cine al­lo­ca­tion plat­form co-led by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s pop­u­la­tion is 270 mil­lion and the plan is for 107.2 mil­lion of them – those aged be­tween 18 and 59 – to be vac­ci­nated. Those with pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions or deemed un­fit will not be in­cluded in the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has also set aside a buf­fer of 15 per cent for its vac­cine stock­pile. At two doses each, it would thus need 247 mil­lion doses in its stock­pile by next year.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy has also tried to se­cure vac­cines from China’s Sinopharm and CanSino Bi­o­log­ics as well as from the UK’s As­traZeneca, but to no avail yet.</p>
    <p>Dr Penny K. Luk­ito, BPOM’s head, has said that it is al­ways ready to ac­com­mo­date the choice of a vac­cine so long as it has gone through proper tri­als.</p>
    <p>“The clin­i­cal tri­als do not have to be done in In­done­sia. Data from the coun­try the vac­cines are from can be used as a ba­sis for BPOM to eval­u­ate and de­cide on emer­gency use ap­proval,” Dr Penny said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment over the gov­ern­ment’s slow progress on vac­cine pro­cure­ment ef­forts.</p>
