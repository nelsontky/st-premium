    <p>The longlist for the Epi­gram Books Fic­tion Prize com­prises a dozen writ­ers from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philip­pines and Thai­land – the most to date. In­stead of four nov­els, six will be cho­sen as fi­nal­ists of the award next year, which will in­crease the to­tal prize money from $40,000 to $50,000.</p>
    <p>The Epi­gram Books Fic­tion Prize next year will dis­burse a to­tal sum of $50,000, as the num­ber of fi­nal­ists goes up from four to six</p>
    <p>Six nov­els will be cho­sen as fi­nal­ists of the Epi­gram Books Fic­tion Prize next year, which will in­crease the to­tal prize money from $40,000 to $50,000.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, the prize was awarded to four nov­els, with one win­ner re­ceiv­ing $25,000 and three fi­nal­ists each get­ting $5,000.</p>
    <p>The sixth edi­tion of the award, which is Sin­ga­pore’s only prize for un­pub­lished English-lan­guage nov­els, will be pre­sented in Jan­uary at a vir­tual cer­e­mony in­stead of the usual ho­tel gala din­ner, in the light of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sav­ings from the din­ner’s can­cel­la­tion will be redi­rected to­wards re­ward­ing more fi­nal­ists in­stead.</p>
    <p>Epi­gram founder Ed­mund Wee, 68, said: “Many artists are strug­gling dur­ing this pan­demic. Now is not the time to cut back on sup­port for them. We have raised enough money from our sup­port­ers and spon­sors for the prize money and other ex­penses.</p>
    <p>“It makes no sense to keep this money for next year when there are writ­ers strug­gling now. We’ll worry about next year when the time comes.”</p>
    <p>All six fi­nal­ists will have their manuscript­s pub­lished.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Epi­gram un­veiled its longlist for the prize, with a dozen writ­ers from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philip­pines and Thai­land – the most num­ber to date.</p>
    <p>Among them are Sin­ga­porean Se­bas­tian Sim, 54, who won the 2017 prize for his satir­i­cal novel The Riot Act, and for­mer fi­nal­ists The New Pa­per news ed­i­tor An­dre Yeo, 48, au­thor of 9th Of Au­gust, and Bruneian aca­demic Kath­rina Mohd Daud, 36, whose novel The Fish­er­man King was short­listed last year and has just been re­leased.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Sim and Yeo, the other seven Sin­ga­pore writ­ers on the list in­clude Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts lec­turer Wes­ley Leon Aroozoo, 36; As­so­ci­a­tion of Comic Artists of Sin­ga­pore vice-pres­i­dent Boey Mei­han, 43; and Daryl Qilin Yam, 29, whose de­but Kappa Quar­tet was longlisted for the 2015 prize.</p>
    <p>They are up against ac­claimed names from the re­gion such as Filipino writer Glenn Diaz, 34, whose 2017 novel The Quiet Ones won the Palanca Grand Prize and the Philip­pine Na­tional Book Award, and Thai writer Wi­pas Srithong, 50, whose novel Khon Khrae (The Dwarf) won the 2012 South-east Asia Write Award.</p>
    <p>The panel of judges in­cludes Mr Wee; film pro­ducer and cu­ra­tor Wahyuni Hadi; chil­dren’s book au­thor Mon­ica Lim; Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor of English Sim Wai Chew; and Mr Gareth Richards, founder of Ger­ak­bu­daya Book­shop in Pe­nang.</p>
    <p>The prize, which is a cash ad­vance against fu­ture roy­al­ties, was started in 2015 for Sin­ga­pore writ­ers and opened to writ­ers from other Asean coun­tries in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee said he would con­sider keep­ing the short­list at six nov­els in lieu of a gala din­ner only if Covid-19 were still around.</p>
    <p>“I think it is im­por­tant to hon­our our au­thors in pub­lic.”</p>
