    <p>AYou can report dis­crim­i­na­tory job ad­verts or hir­ing prac­tices to the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep) us­ing the form here: https://www.tal.sg/tafep/Con­tact-Us.</p>
    <p>Tafep works closely with the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) to in­ves­ti­gate and take ap­pro­pri­ate action against em­ploy­ers when work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion has oc­curred, said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple of po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices could be if a com­pany says a position has been filled even though the job ad­vert was put up just one day ear­lier, es­pe­cially if the ad in­di­cates that the position is open to Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>An­other ex­am­ple is if you call an em­ployer about an open­ing and are turned down im­me­di­ately upon re­veal­ing your age.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work, em­ploy­ers must ad­ver­tise job open­ings on the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture por­tal for at least 28 days be­fore sub­mit­ting Em­ploy­ment Pass or S Pass ap­pli­ca­tions for these po­si­tions, and con­sider all ap­pli­cants fairly. The ad­ver­tis­ing re­quire­ment ap­plies to em­ploy­ers with at least 10 staff mem­bers, but does not in­clude jobs paying a fixed monthly salary of $20,000 and above or short-term va­can­cies of up to one month.</p>
    <p>The Tafep spokesman said some em­ploy­ers are gen­uinely un­fa­mil­iar with lo­cal re­cruit­ment chan­nels or whose re­cruit­ment had been lim­ited by di­rec­tives im­posed by over­seas head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>But the spokesman added: “Busi­nesses op­er­at­ing in Sin­ga­pore need to un­der­stand lo­cal job re­cruit­ment and hir­ing re­quire­ments, and are ex­pected to make rea­son­able ef­forts to not only at­tract and con­sider Sin­ga­pore­ans for job po­si­tions on merit, but also train and de­velop Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Tri­par­tite Guide­lines on Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices state that words or phrases that in­di­cate a pref­er­ence for non-Sin­ga­pore­ans should not be used in job ads.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, em­ploy­ers should avoid phrases such as “na­tive English speaker only”, “Ital­ian chef pre­ferred”, “Span­ish sec­re­tary wel­come”, or “work passes will be ap­plied for for suc­cess­ful can­di­dates”.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite guide­lines also state that em­ploy­ers should hire on the ba­sis of merit and not use age as a lim­it­ing cri­te­rion dur­ing selec­tion or re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>Job ads can in­clude phrases like “can­di­dates are re­quired to load and un­load sacks of rice of at least 10kg each”, but not “young/youth­ful work­ing en­vi­ron­ment” or “min­i­mum aged 21 and above”.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should not in­di­cate an age pref­er­ence for job ap­pli­cants nor re­ject ap­pli­cants based on age, un­less there are statu­tory re­quire­ments on age such as for jobs re­lated to fi­nan­cial con­sul­tancy or ad­vi­sory, and those that deal with al­co­hol or cigarettes, said the Tafep spokesman.</p>
    <p>If you feel you have been un­fairly re­jected based purely on age, you can con­tact Tafep.</p>
    <p>Job­seek­ers may also want to check if a po­ten­tial em­ployer has pro­gres­sive em­ploy­ment prac­tices. There is a list of or­gan­i­sa­tions that have adopted Tri­par­tite Stan­dards on the Tri­par­tite Al­liance web­site: https://www.tal.sg/tafep/get­tingstarte­d/pro­gres­sive/tri­par­tite­s­tandards-adopters.</p>
    <p>Tri­par­tite stan­dards are a set of good em­ploy­ment prac­tices de­ter­mined by the unions, em­ploy­ers and Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 2,631 em­ploy­ers have gone the ex­tra mile to pub­licly pledge to sup­port older work­ers and treat them fairly by adopt­ing the Tri­par­tite Standard on AgeFriendl­y Work­place Prac­tices as at Nov 30.</p>
    <p>This means they com­mit to train older em­ploy­ees to per­form their jobs ef­fec­tively and im­ple­ment health pro­grammes for older staff mem­bers, among other things.</p>
    <p>Also as at Nov 30, 3,632 em­ploy­ers have adopted the Tri­par­tite Standard on Re­cruit­ment Prac­tices, which means they are com­mit­ted to, for ex­am­ple, en­sur­ing job ap­pli­ca­tion forms ask only for in­for­ma­tion rel­e­vant to as­sess­ing an ap­pli­cant’s suit­abil­ity, in­form­ing un­suc­cess­ful can­di­dates of the out­come of their in­ter­view and hav­ing staff trained to con­duct fair and un­bi­ased in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>Job ads can in­clude phrases like “can­di­dates are re­quired to load and un­load sacks of rice of at least 10kg each”, but not “young/youth­ful work­ing en­vi­ron­ment” or “min­i­mum aged 21 and above”.</p>
