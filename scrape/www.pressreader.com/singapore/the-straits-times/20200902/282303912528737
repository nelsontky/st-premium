    <p>PARIS • Two Paris Saint-Ger­main play­ers have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and gone into quar­an­tine, the French tre­ble win­ners an­nounced on Mon­day with­out re­veal­ing their iden­tity.</p>
    <p>But French me­dia said that Ar­gen­tinian in­ter­na­tion­als An­gel di Maria (left) and Le­an­dro Pare­des had cut short their hol­i­days in the Span­ish party is­land of Ibiza af­ter con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“Two Paris Saint-Ger­main play­ers are sus­pected of be­ing in­fected with Covid-19,” said a club state­ment. “The state of their health is very re­as­sur­ing. They have al­ready been sub­jected to the ap­pro­pri­ate health pro­to­cols.”</p>
    <p>Both now face miss­ing PSG’s be­lated start to the Ligue 1 sea­son at Lens on Sept 10 and at home to Mar­seille three days later.</p>
    <p>They fea­tured for the Ligue 1 club in the 1-0 de­feat by Bay­ern Mu­nich in the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal in Lis­bon on Aug 23. Di Maria and Pare­des are not the only PSG play­ers that are look­ing at a spell on the side­lines.</p>
    <p>French sports daily L’Equipe yes­ter­day also claimed that Ar­gentina striker Mauro Icardi is also sus­pected to have been in­fected by Covid-19, while hol­i­day­ing in Ibiza.</p>
    <p>Along with the trio, Spain mid­fielder An­der Her­rera, Costa Rica goal­keeper Key­lor Navas and Brazil for­ward Neymar all flew to Ibiza af­ter the loss in Lis­bon.</p>
    <p>Play­ers all over Europe are re­port­ing back for pre-sea­son train­ing and hav­ing been away from the strict Covid-19 mea­sures for the last few weeks, more are test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>Real So­ciedad on Mon­day said their new sign­ing, former Man­ches­ter City mid­fielder David Silva, had con­tracted the dis­ease, although he was asymp­to­matic. The 34-yearold Spa­niard, who joined the La Liga out­fit on a free trans­fer last month, is self-iso­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>His So­ciedad team­mate, Spain winger Mikel Oyarz­a­bal, also tested pos­i­tive, lead­ing to his with­drawal from the na­tional team ahead of this week’s Na­tions League games.</p>
