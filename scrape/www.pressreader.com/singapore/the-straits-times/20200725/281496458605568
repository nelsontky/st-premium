    <p>The son of the founder of the famed Eng’s won­ton noo­dles is back again in court, in the lat­est chap­ter of a soured re­la­tion­ship with a busi­ness part­ner. This time, Mr Des­mond Ng is be­ing sued by the busi­ness part­ner, Ms Pauline New, over an al­leged con­spir­acy to “in­jure” their com­pany, Eng’s Noo­dles House, and cause it to suf­fer losses.</p>
    <p>Join­ing Mr Ng in de­fend­ing against the law­suit are his two sis­ters – Ms Ng Mui Hong and Ms Ng Mei Ling – and Mr Bill Teng, who owns 5 per cent of the shares in Eng’s Noo­dles House.</p>
    <p>Ms New is also ac­cus­ing Eng’s Char Siew Wan­tan Mee, a com­pany owned by the Ng sis­ters, of be­ing in­volved in the con­spir­acy.</p>
    <p>Mr Des­mond Ng is the son of Mr Ng Ba Eng, who ran a stall at Dun­man Road Food Cen­tre sell­ing won­ton noo­dles for decades. The el­der Mr Ng died in 2013.</p>
    <p>In 2012, the eatery re­lo­cated to 287 Tan­jong Ka­tong Road, where it was named Eng’s Noo­dles House.</p>
    <p>A com­pany with the same name was also reg­is­tered at that time, with Mr Des­mond Ng and Ms New as di­rec­tors and share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Shares in the com­pany were later al­lot­ted to Mr Teng, who was han­dling its ac­counts, in 2015.</p>
    <p>In 2018, The Straits Times re­ported that a new lease for 287 Tan­jong Ka­tong Road had been signed by Mr Thomas Hong, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of soup chain Lao Huo Tang. The shop is now known as Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle.</p>
    <p>In the same year, Mr Ng ap­plied to the High Court to wind up Eng’s Noo­dles House, say­ing that the di­rec­tors can no longer work with one an­other and were not on speak­ing terms. The court re­jected his ap­pli­ca­tion, and or­dered him to pay $4,000 in le­gal costs to Ms New.</p>
    <p>The trial for the cur­rent case be­gan in the High Court on Mon­day, and is ex­pected to end on Aug 7.</p>
    <p>In her suit, Ms New, who is rep­re­sented by lawyers Les­lie Yeo and Jo­lene Tan, claims that she is act­ing “in a rep­re­sen­ta­tive ca­pac­ity” and “on be­half of and for the ben­e­fit of” Eng’s Noo­dles House.</p>
    <p>She as­serts that Mr Ng, his sis­ters and Mr Teng con­spired to carry out a se­ries of acts that caused Eng’s Noo­dles House to suf­fer losses.</p>
    <p>She claims that the acts cul­mi­nated in the set­ting up of Eng’s Char Siew Wan­tan Mee, which runs a “com­pet­ing won­ton noo­dle busi­ness” at 248/250 Tan­jong Ka­tong Road – doors away from where the orig­i­nal eatery was lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Such acts in­clude at­tempt­ing to usurp the as­sets of Eng’s Noo­dles House, and de­lib­er­ately shut­ting down the busi­ness even though it was prof­itable, Ms New al­leges.</p>
    <p>Ms New also claims Mr Ng and Mr Teng mis­led her in 2015 into sign­ing doc­u­ments to di­lute her share­hold­ing in Eng’s Noo­dles House, thereby al­low­ing them to be­come its ma­jor­ity share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>This even­tu­ally paved the way for her re­moval as di­rec­tor in June 2018 and to sti­fle any po­ten­tial le­gal ac­tion by the com­pany against both men, she claims. She fur­ther ac­cuses Mr Ng and Mr Teng of breach­ing their du­ties as di­rec­tors of the com­pany, among other things.</p>
    <p>Cast­ing doubts on Ms New’s mo­tives in com­menc­ing the law­suit, Mr Teng – who is rep­re­sented by lawyers Suresh Damodara, Cle­ment Ong and Joni Khoo – con­tends that she has not made any al­le­ga­tions against Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle, the cur­rent shop at 287 Tan­jong Ka­tong Road.</p>
    <p>The shop has been us­ing the “Eng’s” brand since it be­gan oper­a­tions in April 2018, he as­serts.</p>
    <p>The Ng sis­ters and their com­pany, rep­re­sented by lawyers Leo Cheng Suan and Denise Tay, are coun­ter­su­ing Ms New over her al­leged in­volve­ment in Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle. Among other things, they claim that Ms New and her hus­band are in­volved in de­ceiv­ing the for­mer cus­tomers of Eng’s Noo­dles House that Eng’s Wan­tan Noo­dle is the same busi­ness started by the Ng fam­ily. The trial re­sumes on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Pauline New as­serts that Mr Des­mond Ng, his sis­ters and Mr Bill Teng con­spired to carry out a se­ries of acts that caused Eng’s Noo­dles House to suf­fer losses.</p>
