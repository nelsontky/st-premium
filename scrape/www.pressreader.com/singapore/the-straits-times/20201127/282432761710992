    <p>MI­LAN • Zine­dine Zi­dane praised his side’s per­for­mance as one of the best this sea­son as Real Madrid closed in on the knock­out phase of the Cham­pi­ons League with a 2-0 win against 10-man In­ter Mi­lan on Wed­nes­day.</p>

    <p>JOB WELL DONE</p>
    <p>seven min­utes for his first strike in Europe for Real.</p>
    <p>An own goal by for­mer Real de­fender Achraf Hakimi then dou­bled their lead as the Span­ish cham­pi­ons brushed off the in­jury ab­sences of cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos and Karim Ben­zema, while push­ing the Ital­ians to the brink of elim­i­na­tion from the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“They told us that you don’t win in the Cham­pi­ons League with­out Ser­gio Ramos, and this evening, we did it,” said Zi­dane, whose side notched their first vic­tory at the San Siro.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know if this is our most com­plete match of the sea­son or not, but we pro­duced a great per­for­mance from start to fin­ish, in­tense and se­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>“We knew that these were three su­per im­por­tant points for us and that drew the best out of my team.”</p>
    <p>His men had taken just one point from their first two games af­ter a 3-2 loss to Shakhtar Donetsk and a 2-2 draw against Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach, but two suc­ces­sive Cham­pi­ons League vic­to­ries have put them back in the driv­ing seat.</p>
    <p>Real, the record 13-time Euro­pean cham­pi­ons, are now sec­ond in Group B with seven points, one point be­hind Monchengla­d­bach, with In­ter bot­tom on just two points and only two games re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Coach An­to­nio Conte rued the dis­missal of Ar­turo Vi­dal for dis­sent had left the hosts with a “moun­tain to climb” and ad­mit­ted his side, who are fac­ing a third con­sec­u­tive exit from the group phase, had re­ceived a re­al­ity check.</p>
    <p>“Leav­ing a team with 10 af­ter 30 min­utes is to kill them,” the Ital­ian said. “I think we saw a dif­fer­ence be­tween us and them. This should not</p>

    <p>“We must work, be ea­ger and also hum­ble to un­der­stand what level we are.</p>
    <p>“We must not let our­selves be dis­tracted by alarm bells com­ing from the out­side, the only way to go is the path of work and growth.”</p>
    <p>A minute’s si­lence took place be­fore kick-off in hon­our of Diego Maradona, who died on Wed­nes­day aged 60, and both Zi­dane and Conte paid tributes to the 1986 World Cup win­ner.</p>
