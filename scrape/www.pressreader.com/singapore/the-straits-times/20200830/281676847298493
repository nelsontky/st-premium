    <p>Once the world’s se­cond hard­est-hit by the coro­n­avirus, South Korea has touted one of the low­est Covid-19 in­fec­tion and fa­tal­ity rates among de­vel­oped na­tions. But a church clus­ter and an anti-govern­ment rally on Aug 15 in Seoul may over­turn its suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Cases traced to the Sarang Jeil Church in north­ern Seoul, which is at the cen­tre of the re­cent surge of in­fec­tions, was more than 1,000, said the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion. The church out­break led to at least 25 new clus­ters, with cases re­ported in sev­eral prov­inces and mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties out­side Greater Seoul. More than 300 peo­ple who joined the protest this month to­gether with church mem­bers have tested pos­i­tive so far.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment ac­cuses the church of ob­struc­tion by not pro­vid­ing a com­plete list of mem­bers and spread­ing fake news, while church mem­bers say they are vic­tims of a po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated witch-hunt.</p>
    <p>When the first in­fec­tions were re­ported among church mem­bers on Aug 12, the govern­ment said the group flouted so­cial dis­tanc­ing in­struc­tions, with the church’s leader and oth­ers at­tend­ing the mas­sive rally.</p>
    <p>Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kim Gang-lip told re­porters two weeks ago that the au­thor­i­ties had dif­fi­culty track­ing down the Sarang Jeil mem­bers and plac­ing them un­der quar­an­tine be­cause the name list was in­ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>Po­lice on Friday said they have ini­ti­ated a probe into a Sarang Jeil pas­tor for al­legedly urg­ing a church­goer who had symp­toms of the Covid-19 to post­pone tak­ing a virus test, one day be­fore the Aug 15 rally. The church­goer later tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
