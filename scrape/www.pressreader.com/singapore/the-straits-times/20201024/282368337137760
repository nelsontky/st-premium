    <p>Like most, trainer James Peters knows Kranji’s next big thing In­ferno is hard to top­ple in to­mor­row’s $400,000 Group 1 Lion City Cup over 1,200m.</p>
    <p>But the English­man is also aware his two run­ners, Sky­walk and Grand Koonta, are “live” chances in Sin­ga­pore’s top sprint.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, nine-time win­ner Sky­walk is the high­est-rated con­tender in the 16-horse line-up.</p>
    <p>The big-hearted grey Grand Koonta has five wins, in­clud­ing his last start af­ter an eight-month break on Sept 26, and four sec­onds from nine starts.</p>
    <p>“Both horses are well. They tri­alled last week and have come through that fine,” said Peters, who is en­joy­ing a good sea­son with 19 win­ners.</p>
    <p>“I would say Grand Koonta has im­proved since his first-up win. He was then up in body weight, he had only some soft tri­als and has tight­ened up since.</p>
    <p>“I thought Sky­walk also ran very well i n that race Grand Koonta won. He was beaten only around three lengths and he was car­ry­ing the top weight.</p>
    <p>“He’ll be back at level weights this time. Sure, he’s prob­a­bly bet­ter on Poly­track, but he’s the toprated horse in the field.”</p>
    <p>South African Ryan Munger, who was beaten at the post in the $400,000 Group 1 Raf­fles Cup on Sun Mar­shal a fort­night ago, will ride Sky­walk.</p>
    <p>French­man Louis-Philippe Beuzelin will be aboard Grand Koonta.</p>
    <p>For Peters, if his two aces can bring their A game to the race to­mor­row, they should be in with a shout at the busi­ness end, re­gard­less of the daunt­ing pres­ence of the Cliff Brown-trained In­ferno.</p>
    <p>Peters ad­mit­ted In­ferno has been very im­pres­sive in what he has done, but the seven-time win­ner from eight starts is com­ing back from his Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Guineas vic­tory over 1,600m to 1,200m to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“You can’t knock him, but he’s jump­ing back from the mile and he will be run­ning against more sea­soned sprint­ers,” said Peters.</p>
    <p>“The 1,200m might just make it a lit­tle harder for him. We’ll see, but he’s still a very good horse.</p>
    <p>“To me, it’s just so ex­cit­ing to have two ‘live’ chances in a Group 1 race. We don’t get that of­ten.”</p>
