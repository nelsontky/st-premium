    <p>The Covid-19 virus that brought the world to a stand­still also brought com­merce to its knees, forc­ing busi­nesses to adapt or be ren­dered ex­tinct.</p>
    <p>It was no dif­fer­ent for fash­ion, with the pandemic forc­ing the in­dus­try to evolve at hy­per­speed.</p>
    <p>In fact, by the time this ar­ti­cle was re­searched and writ­ten, some de­vel­op­ments in the in­dus­try had al­ready changed. That is how fast­paced fash­ion is.</p>
    <p>The alarm­ing pace at which fash­ion works to re­cu­per­ate its losses has birthed a smor­gas­bord of pre­sen­ta­tion for­mats, un­usu­ally com­plex media strate­gies and new on­line plat­forms that have re­sulted in a con­stant influx of con­tent.</p>
    <p>Nat­u­rally, the pro­duc­tion surge ex­ac­er­bates pre-Covid-19 prob­lems – con­flict­ing dead­lines, un­re­al­is­tic time­lines, ex­haust­ing man­power and a general lack of unity among var­i­ous parts of the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Against this back­drop, where is cre­ativ­ity headed in the fu­ture?</p>
    <p>THE SHOW MUST GO ON... OR MUST IT?</p>
    <p>De­spite the crit­i­cism of fly­ing thou­sands of ed­i­tors, in­flu­encers and buy­ers across the world to watch a 10-minute show, fash­ion shows are still hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>In mere months since the first big brands an­nounced their ex­its from the fash­ion cal­en­dar – namely, Saint Lau­rent and Gucci in April and May re­spec­tively – the di­vide be­tween brands and their stance on phys­i­cal fash­ion shows is clear.</p>
    <p>The va­ri­ety of the spring/ sum­mer 2021 shows is tes­ta­ment to this. Moschino clev­erly used pup­pets to stage its show, although de­signer Jeremy Scott makes a brief real-life cameo.</p>
    <p>Bal­main put its 58 ab­sent at­ten­dees on front-row flat screens, but still staged a tra­di­tional show with 103 looks.</p>
    <p>Burberry put on a 20-minute pre­sen­ta­tion sans au­di­ence in a for­est and streamed it on Twitch, a pop­u­lar gam­ing service.</p>
    <p>Brands that did not host phys­i­cal shows pro­duced videos in­stead – such as Dries Van Noten, MSGM and Sal­va­tore Fer­rag­amo – to var­i­ous de­grees of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>For most, watch­ing fash­ion pre­sen­ta­tions on­line lacked the en­ergy of an in-real-life in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>So that begs the ques­tions: How do you mean­ing­fully en­gage with au­di­ences? How do brands stand out? Can dig­i­tal pre­sen­ta­tions do jus­tice as a sub­sti­tute for phys­i­cal shows? What makes phys­i­cal shows so unique in the first place?</p>
    <p>Prada’s spring/sum­mer 2021 show, the first of Mi­uc­cia Prada and Raf Simons’ part­ner­ship, pro­vided pos­si­ble an­swers. Via In­sta­gram, the brand asked its au­di­ence to send in ques­tions for both de­sign­ers to an­swer in a con­ver­sa­tion that took place af­ter the show.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing two equally icon­o­clas­tic de­sign­ers work­ing to­gether is something prac­ti­cally un­heard of, and so the oc­ca­sion called for a new, dif­fer­ent en­gage­ment for­mat. It drew 48 mil­lion views on social sites Douyin and Weibo, two mil­lion on YouTube and 706,000 on IG TV. The col­lec­tion was unan­i­mously, crit­i­cally ac­claimed.</p>
    <p>“During the lock­down, (I) re­alised how im­por­tant tech­nol­ogy is and how (it al­lows) an ex­ten­sion (of) our­selves,” Prada said post­show. “Be­cause we are do­ing a small film, we hope you can en­joy the clothes bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal land­scape is not an easy one to nav­i­gate these days. Dig­i­tal media en­gage­ment has plum­meted con­sid­er­ably since phys­i­cal fash­ion shows have not been tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to brand per­for­mance cloud Launch­metrics, Lon­don Fash­ion Week in June had 55 per cent less social media en­gage­ment than it did in Jan­uary this year.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, the gam­ing in­dus­try has ben­e­fited well from peo­ple stay­ing home.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Rolling Stone, Amer­i­can rap­per Travis Scott’s in-game con­cert for Fort­nite, the wildly pop­u­lar bat­tle royale game, led to an in­crease of 26 per cent in his lis­ten­ing stream in just one day and, as CNet re­ported, was ul­ti­mately seen by 28 mil­lion over five days.</p>
    <p>For Prada to be able to top 16 times its views of its last wom­enswear show demon­strates how a multi-plat­form strat­egy is es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>NEW FOR­MATS PAY OFF</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tive for­mats call for even more com­pli­cated pro­duc­tions, but risk-tak­ing – all the more scary in these times – has paid off for some.</p>
    <p>In July, the cou­ture shows achieved a good bal­ance be­tween en­gage­ment and cre­ativ­ity.</p>
    <p>Mai­son Margiela pre­miered a doc­u­men­tary-style film di­rected by fash­ion pho­tog­ra­pher Nick Knight that doc­u­ments creative di­rec­tor John Gal­liano’s rig­or­ous creative process in de­vel­op­ing the col­lec­tion with the ate­lier un­der new cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>The film utilises Google searches, Zoom calls, sur­veil­lance footage from drones hov­er­ing in the stu­dio and GoPros at­tached to var­i­ous mem­bers of the ate­lier, in­clud­ing mod­els and even one of their dogs.</p>
    <p>Such trans­parency and voyeurism is fit­ting, com­ing from Margiela – its ar­ti­sanal la­bel has prac­ti­cally de­mys­ti­fied cou­ture savoir faire.</p>
    <p>To see a full pic­ture of how an ate­lier adapts to such a heav­ily dig­i­tal process so can­didly is com­fort­ing and sober­ing – and some­how com­pletely re­lat­able.</p>
    <p>Alas, most peo­ple still want to dream when they see cou­ture.</p>
    <p>Dior’s col­lec­tion was pre­sented as a fan­tasy film, fol­low­ing two trav­el­ling porters car­ry­ing Maria Grazia Chi­uri’s trunk of cou­ture dolls through a land of nymphs, cen­taurs and other myth­i­cal crea­tures – def­i­nitely a new for­mat for Chi­uri. While Dior cre­ated minia­tures, Valentino made</p>
    <p>tow­er­ing giants. The Ital­ian house staged a “height­ened” event at Rome’s Cinecitta, which screened a glitchy film by Knight, af­ter which the cur­tains drew to re­veal mod­els hov­ered above au­di­ences like circus per­form­ers. The gowns were al­most 4m tall.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple have seen time and time again, in times of aus­ter­ity, fash­ion brings its ex­u­ber­ance.</p>
    <p>But per­haps the most in­no­va­tive at­tempt in rec­on­cil­ing phys­i­cal bar­ri­ers was not from the three days of cou­ture shows, but Loewe’s spring/sum­mer 2021 menswear col­lec­tion by Jonathan An­der­son.</p>
    <p>The “show in a box” for­mat, in­spired by Mar­cel Duchamp’s La Boite-en-valise (which trans­lates roughly as “box in a suit­case”), gave ed­i­tors a por­ta­ble, in­ti­mate ex­pe­ri­ence of its col­lec­tion. It came with fab­ric swatches, a popup book of what would have been the run­way set, a man­ual record player, mini print­outs of ac­ces­sories, in­spi­ra­tions and cutout pa­per sil­hou­ettes of the team.</p>
    <p>What set this pre­sen­ta­tion apart was also its solid dig­i­tal ac­ti­va­tion – video con­tent was re­leased hourly for 24 hours on IG TV and then ag­gre­gated on the Loewe site.</p>
    <p>So while only ed­i­tors re­ceived the com­plete box, ev­ery­one could en­joy the idea.</p>
    <p>Down­load­able, DIY con­tent was also re­leased, in­clud­ing pat­terns of a pa­per pineap­ple toy and Look 23, which can be printed and as­sem­bled.</p>
    <p>An­der­son has since re­peated that for­mat for sub­se­quent col­lec­tions, and with his spring/sum­mer 2021 wom­enswear pre­sen­ta­tion, even evolved it into a “show on the wall” – where re­cip­i­ents of a gar­gan­tuan Loewe box set (it in­cluded life-size cutouts of the looks, wall­pa­per, brush, scis­sors and glue) can mount its con­tents on the wall.</p>
    <p>It was a bril­liant bea­con of po­ten­tial and in­ge­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>An­der­son told The Busi­ness of Fash­ion: “I think it’s going to be very dif­fi­cult to go back. Ev­ery­one is wear­ing them­selves on their sleeves.”</p>
    <p>If there is one les­son peo­ple have learnt from the re­cent shows, it is that the clothes must still be the stars. Peo­ple have seen re­ally good clothes in re­cent months, and per­haps phys­i­cal lim­i­ta­tions have helped ideas thrive.</p>
    <p>As Pier­paolo Pic­ci­oli said of his de­ci­sion to move Valentino’s spring/sum­mer 2021 show from the usual Paris to Mi­lan: “The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion has forced us to make an un­usual de­ci­sion... I feel en­er­gised when I can work on ideas, and this is the time for ideas to spread and grow.”</p>
