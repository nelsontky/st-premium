    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK A wave of hefty fines against ma­jor banks in the past decade spurred an ex­plo­sion in the num­ber of trans­ac­tions that lenders flag as sus­pect to the US gov­ern­ment. It’s not clear all the scru­tiny is mak­ing a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Banks moved money for peo­ple or en­ti­ties they could not iden­tify, and in many cases failed to file the re­quired sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports un­til years later, ac­cord­ing to an in­ves­ti­ga­tion re­leased over the week­end by the In­ter­na­tional Con­sor­tium of In­ves­tiga­tive Jour­nal­ists (ICIJ). The re­port, based on leaked doc­u­ments ob­tained by Buz­zFeed News and shared with the con­sor­tium, said that in some cases the banks kept mov­ing il­licit funds af­ter re­ceiv­ing warn­ings from US of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>“They need to do a bet­ter job of shut­ting down these ac­counts once they see re­peated rea­sons for fil­ing sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports,” Mr Tom Car­da­mone, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Global Fi­nan­cial In­tegrity, a Washington-based or­gan­i­sa­tion track­ing il­le­gal money flows world­wide, said in a tele­phone in­ter­view. There are “clients so bad that nu­mer­ous SARs (sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports) are be­ing filed about them, but no one ever does any­thing about it”.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ments re­vealed on Sun­day shed light on a faulty sys­tem where banks com­plain about re­ports that get no fol­low-up from the au­thor­i­ties, while crit­ics say lenders are check­ing off boxes with­out tak­ing mean­ing­ful steps to stop fi­nan­cial crime. It all risks an­other black eye for ma­jor in­ter­na­tional banks that paid a to­tal of US$20 bil­lion (S$27 bil­lion) from 2012 to 2015 for hav­ing lax con­trols against money laun­der­ing, help­ing clients evade taxes or vi­o­lat­ing US sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ments which the ICIJ ob­tained iden­ti­fied more than</p>
    <p>US$2 tril­lion in trans­ac­tions be­tween 1999 and 2017 that were flagged by fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions’ in­ter­nal com­pli­ance of­fi­cers as pos­si­ble money laun­der­ing or other crim­i­nal ac­tiv­ity, the re­port said. The top two banks are Deutsche Bank, which dis­closed US$1.3 tril­lion of sus­pi­cious money in the files, and JPMor­gan Chase, which dis­closed US$514 bil­lion, the anal­y­sis found.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion was based on more than 2,100 “sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports” filed by banks with the US De­part­ment of Trea­sury’s Fi­nan­cial Crimes En­force­ment Net­work. The re­port, dubbed the FinCEN Files, was the re­sult of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by more than 100 news or­gan­i­sa­tions in 88 coun­tries, Buz­zFeed said. Bloomberg News was not in­cluded in the con­sor­tium and has not seen the leaked doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Large fines of HSBC Hold­ings and Stan­dard Char­tered Bank in 2012 helped spur a spike in sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports, from about 60,000 that year to more than two mil­lion an­nu­ally in re­cent years. Yet law en­force­ment agen­cies in­quire about only 4 per cent of those alerts, ac­cord­ing to a Bank Pol­icy In­sti­tute survey. And only 1 per cent of il­licit money in the fi­nan­cial sys­tem is con­fis­cated, the United Na­tions es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>“Fil­ing SARs is not a get-out-of-jail-free card,” said Mr Dan Sti­pano, a part­ner at law firm Buck­ley and for­mer deputy chief coun­sel of the Of­fice of the Comptrolle­r of the Cur­rency. “Many banks have faced ma­jor en­force­ment ac­tions af­ter hav­ing filed many SARs if they failed to take the ap­pro­pri­ate action on their clients. SARs don’t cover your back nec­es­sar­ily.”</p>
    <p>While reg­u­la­tors re­quire banks to file sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports within 30 to 60 days, many firms have taken months or even years on av­er­age to flag the sus­pect trans­ac­tions they saw, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Bank Pol­icy In­sti­tute, an in­dus­try group, said banks are legally pro­hib­ited from talk­ing about sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports. Based on past in­stances, some cases are likely con­nected to re­quests by law en­force­ment to keep a so-called sus­pi­cious ac­count open so that the au­thor­i­ties are able to track where the money is go­ing be­fore mount­ing an ar­rest or con­vic­tion, it said.</p>
    <p>Banks have hired thou­sands of em­ploy­ees to beef up anti-money laun­der­ing and fi­nan­cial crime teams, and some with­drew from cer­tain coun­tries and dropped cor­re­spon­dent-bank­ing ties with hun­dreds of smaller lenders. But ex­ec­u­tives have con­ceded they will not be able to stamp out all il­licit ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“It’s the na­ture of bank­ing: They move money,” Mr Jim Richards, for­mer head of anti-money laun­der­ing at Wells Fargo and Bank of Amer­ica, who now runs his own ad­vi­sory firm RegTech Con­sult­ing. “So de­spite all the ef­forts to crack down on this, there’ll al­ways be some crim­i­nal money mov­ing through the bank­ing sys­tem. It’s a very small por­tion of the tril­lions of dol­lars they han­dle ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple high­lighted in the re­port: JPMor­gan moved more than US$1 bil­lion for the fugi­tive fi­nancier be­hind Malaysia’s 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal, based on records. The bank also pro­cessed pay­ments for Paul Manafort, for­mer cam­paign man­ager for US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, af­ter he re­signed from the cam­paign amid money laun­der­ing and cor­rup­tion al­le­ga­tions from his work with a pro-Rus­sian po­lit­i­cal party in Ukraine, ac­cord­ing to the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>JPMor­gan told ICIJ that it was legally pro­hib­ited from dis­cussing clients or trans­ac­tions. It said it has taken a “lead­er­ship role” in pur­su­ing “proac­tive in­tel­li­gence-led in­ves­ti­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>“We re­port sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity to the gov­ern­ment so that law en­force­ment can com­bat fi­nan­cial crime,” the bank said in a state­ment to Bloomberg News. “We have played a lead­er­ship role in anti-money laun­der­ing re­form that will modernise how the gov­ern­ment and law en­force­ment com­bat money laun­der­ing, ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing and other fi­nan­cial crimes.”</p>
    <p>Com­pli­ance staff in big banks, of­ten over­worked and lack­ing in re­sources, re­lied on ba­sic Google searches to find out the iden­tity of the peo­ple be­hind money trans­fers, the ICIJ said. Banks of­ten filed sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports only af­ter a trans­ac­tion or cus­tomer be­came the sub­ject of a neg­a­tive news re­port or a gov­ern­ment probe, when the funds are long gone, the ICIJ said, cit­ing the doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Stan­Chart, Bank of New York Mel­lon Corp and Bar­clays were other lenders that flagged more than US$20 bil­lion of sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity in the files ob­tained by the ICIJ. A Bank of New York spokesman said the firm “takes its role in pro­tect­ing the in­tegrity of the global fi­nan­cial sys­tem se­ri­ously, in­clud­ing fil­ing sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports”. Stan­Chart and Bar­clays said in state­ments to Buz­zFeed that they invest sig­nif­i­cant re­sources in de­tect­ing and flag­ging sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Deutsche Bank re­sponded in a state­ment that “ICIJ has re­ported on a num­ber of his­toric is­sues” and those re­lated to the bank are “well known” to reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>“The is­sues have al­ready been in­ves­ti­gated and led to reg­u­la­tory res­o­lu­tions in which the bank’s co­op­er­a­tion and re­me­di­a­tion were pub­licly recog­nised,” it said.</p>
    <p>The firm’s for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive John Cryan in 2016 summed up the in­dus­try’s unique role, with all the chal­lenges that brings.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been slow to recog­nise that we are an ex­ten­sion of law en­force­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>While reg­u­la­tors re­quire banks to file sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity re­ports within 30 to 60 days, many firms have taken months or even years on av­er­age to flag the sus­pect trans­ac­tions they saw, said the re­port.</p>
