    <p>Sin­ga­pore saw fewer merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions (M&As) and other deals amid the coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­ces­sion this year, said a re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 640 trans­ac­tions worth US$65.3 bil­lion (S$87 bil­lion) – in­clud­ing M&As, ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs), and pri­vate eq­uity and ven­ture cap­i­tal deals – were recorded between De­cem­ber last year to last month, the lat­est Duff & Phelps Trans­ac­tion Trail Re­port showed.</p>
    <p>That com­pares with 809 trans­ac­tions worth US$81.2 bil­lion in the ear­lier 12-month pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Malaysia recorded a to­tal of 295 trans­ac­tions worth US$5.9 bil­lion, while Indonesia saw 184 trans­ac­tions amount­ing to US$13.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>M&As in Indonesia bucked the de­clin­ing re­gional trend, reg­is­ter­ing US$9.7 bil­lion in value, up 35 per cent from US$7.2 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>The drag wit­nessed in deal ac­tiv­ity, how­ever, pulled down the trans­ac­tion vol­ume to 62 M&As this year, from 94 last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Sriv­idya Gopal, manag­ing di­rec­tor of Duff & Phelps in Sin­ga­pore, said busi­nesses across the world have faced se­ri­ous chal­lenges aris­ing from the pan­demic, lock­downs and travel curbs.</p>
    <p>Those curbs re­sulted in val­u­a­tion un­cer­tainty, trans­ac­tions be­ing can­celled or rene­go­ti­ated, im­pair­ment losses and bank­rupt­cies.</p>
    <p>“The ro­bust level of deal ac­tiv­ity in the re­gion in 2020, de­spite these chal­lenges, is a tes­ta­ment to the crit­i­cal­ity of trans­ac­tions and in­vest­ments for the strate­gic growth and sus­te­nance of busi­nesses here,” she said.</p>
    <p>The re­port showed that a to­tal of 482 M&A deals were struck in Sin­ga­pore, val­ued at US$59.2 bil­lion, com­pared with US$72.4 bil­lion a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Out­bound deals – Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies buy­ing eq­uity stakes off­shore – formed the bulk of the M&A trans­ac­tions, amount­ing to US$40 bil­lion or 67 per cent of the to­tal deal value, fol­lowed by do­mes­tic deals which amounted to US$12.9 bil­lion, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the same pe­riod, Sin­ga­pore wit­nessed 149 pri­vate eq­uity and ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ments, worth a to­tal of US$5.2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­tal raised from IPO listings in Sin­ga­pore was no­tice­ably lower this year. A to­tal of US$944 mil­lion in IPO cap­i­tal was raised for this year, sig­nif­i­cantly be­low last year’s US$2.3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate was the top sec­tor this year, con­tribut­ing to about 38 per cent of M&A value, driven by con­sol­i­da­tion in the sec­tor as well as over­seas ac­qui­si­tions by Sin­ga­pore in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The en­ergy sec­tor took the sec­ond spot at 19 per cent, fol­lowed by bank­ing, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and in­sur­ance in third place.</p>
    <p>Ms Gopal said that while she ex­pects the im­pact of the pan­demic to last for sev­eral more months, busi­nesses have adapted to the new nor­mal of do­ing deals.</p>
    <p>“With this view and con­sid­er­ing the po­lit­i­cal changes in the US, a pos­si­ble im­prove­ment in the USChina re­la­tion­ship, more po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, con­tin­ued in­crease in tech­nol­ogy adop­tion and in­creased avail­abil­ity of cap­i­tal re­sources to the re­gion, we can ex­pect to see strong trans­ac­tion ac­tiv­ity in the fu­ture,” she noted.</p>
