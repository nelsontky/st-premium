    <p>On Mon­day, two Aus­tralian jour­nal­ists left China, mark­ing a new low in Sino-Aus­tralian ties. Both were ear­lier banned from leav­ing but were al­lowed to do so af­ter be­ing ques­tioned by se­cu­rity per­son­nel in re­la­tion to last month’s de­ten­tion of an Aus­tralian jour­nal­ist who worked for Chi­nese TV. Bei­jing’s rev­e­la­tion yes­ter­day that Aus­tralian in­tel­li­gence per­son­nel searched the homes of Chi­nese jour­nal­ists in June and ques­tioned them for hours sug­gested pos­si­ble tit-for-tat moves. The episode adds to wors­en­ing ties as Can­berra pushed back against what it per­ceived as Bei­jing’s threat to its democ­racy and sovereignt­y. That in­cluded a 2017 law against for­eign in­ter­fer­ence in its pol­i­tics af­ter what it saw as China’s ef­forts to in­flu­ence its politi­cians. Aus­tralia banned tech firm Huawei in 2018 from its 5G net­work on grounds of na­tional se­cu­rity. More re­cently, it sus­pended its ex­tra­di­tion treaty with Hong Kong over the im­po­si­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law there, and re­jected China’s mar­itime claims in the South China Sea. But Aus­tralia is hardly the only one that has re­acted to China’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness in its for­eign pol­icy. Oth­ers in­clude Asean – also against China’s South China Sea claims. In­dia, in the midst of a bor­der row with China, has up­graded ties with Aus­tralia to a strate­gic part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>China’s as­sertive­ness in­creased in re­cent years as it pur­sues Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s dream of na­tional re­ju­ve­na­tion that in­cludes mov­ing the coun­try closer to the world’s cen­tre stage. This can be seen in the con­sol­i­da­tion of its South China Sea claims through build­ing mil­i­tary gar­risons on re­claimed is­lands, among other things. There is also what an Aus­tralian think-tank de­scribed last week as its co­er­cive diplo­macy – in­clud­ing trade sanc­tions, in­vest­ment re­stric­tions, tourism bans, and state-is­sued threats. These are meant to pun­ish “un­de­sir­able be­hav­iour” and fo­cus on is­sues such as ter­ri­to­rial claims, Huawei’s 5G tech­nol­ogy and Bei­jing’s han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­ports on such ac­tions paint China as a self-in­ter­ested bully. Yet Bei­jing has the op­por­tu­nity to counter these and mend its im­age by em­pha­sis­ing its com­mon in­ter­ests with the world. These in­clude find­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine and tack­ling cli­mate change. Pres­i­dent Xi said China will make its vac­cine a global pub­lic good once it is avail­able. By hon­our­ing this pledge, China will clearly win hearts and minds abroad. There is also its Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive to help build in­fra­struc­ture. At a time when de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are in a bind be­cause of the pan­demic, in­fra­struc­ture projects will boost economies, es­pe­cially if projects use lo­cal com­pa­nies and labour. Such new projects will im­prove con­nec­tiv­ity and com­pet­i­tive­ness – po­si­tion­ing such na­tions for a global re­cov­ery. China can and should ad­dress the neg­a­tive im­pres­sions of its as­sertive­ness and show how it is, in fact, a re­li­able part­ner for re­gional growth and sta­bil­ity.</p>
