    <p>For­mer Jakarta gov­er­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama has lam­basted bad bu­reau­cracy, rent-seek­ing and sys­tem­atic in­ef­fi­ciency in In­done­sia’s state-owned com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on YouTube chan­nel Poin, which has more than 1 mil­lion sub­scribers, Mr Ba­suki, who is pop­u­larly known by his Chi­nese nick­name Ahok, ex­pressed his frus­tra­tion with the man­age­ment of sta­te­owned oil com­pany Per­tam­ina for us­ing loans to buy over­seas oil fields while ig­nor­ing prospec­tive busi­nesses do­mes­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>He also al­leged that an­other state com­pany was try­ing to en­gage in rent-seek­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ba­suki, a po­lit­i­cal ally of Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, serves as the chief of Per­tam­ina’s board of com­mis­sion­ers, whose job is to su­per­vise the board of di­rec­tors. He is also a mem­ber of the rul­ing In­done­sian Demo­cratic Party of Strug­gle.</p>
    <p>Per­tam­ina is among 140 com­pa­nies that come un­der the Sta­te­Owned En­ter­prise Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mr Ba­suki said In­done­sia should es­tab­lish a su­per hold­ing com­pany for state-con­trolled firms, like Sin­ga­pore’s sov­er­eign wealth fund Te­masek.</p>
    <p>“The State-Owned En­ter­prise Min­istry should be dis­banded... and we (should) in­stead have In­done­sia In­cor­po­ra­tion, like (Sin­ga­pore has) Te­masek,” Mr Ba­suki said in the 61/ minute YouTube video up­loaded last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>He also sin­gled out an­other sta­te­owned com­pany that tried to charge Per­tam­ina a 500-bil­lion ru­piah (S$45 mil­lion) fee for a “going­into-a-pa­per­less-of­fice project”.</p>
    <p>Per­tam­ina’s man­age­ment, Mr Ba­suki said, had un­duly ig­nored of­fers by pri­vate in­vestors to work to­gether to build oil re­finer­ies, which In­done­sia badly needs in or­der to cut its de­pen­dency on fuel im­ports.</p>
    <p>He also said Per­tam­ina could have tapped into at least 12 po­ten­tial oil blocks for ex­plo­ration do­mes­ti­cally rather than ven­tur­ing over­seas and buy­ing for­eign as­sets.</p>
    <p>Build­ing re­finer­ies is a pro­gramme Mr Joko wishes Per­tam­ina to un­der­take ex­pe­di­tiously.</p>
    <p>Mr Ba­suki took is­sue as well with the fact that un­der­per­form­ing Per­tam­ina se­nior of­fi­cials were sacked from their re­spec­tive posts but con­tin­ued to re­ceive the same fat salaries merely on grounds of se­nior­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Ba­suki, an eth­nic Chi­nese who is a Chris­tian, had been ac­cused of blas­phemy by po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents, af­ter he made a speech in Septem­ber 2016 that re­ferred to a Qu­ranic verse. He was con­victed and later sen­tenced to two years in prison for blas­phemy in 2017.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he was re­leased from prison, Mr Ba­suki was ap­pointed by Mr Joko to the po­si­tion of chief com­mis­sioner of Per­tam­ina, one of the coun­try’s most strate­gic state com­pa­nies that had been of­ten plagued by in­ef­fi­ciency and cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>The YouTube video posted last week has gar­nered 1.2 mil­lion views. In it, Mr Ba­suki said that those re­sist­ing him are wrongly ac­cus­ing him of cre­at­ing dishar­mony and chaos in Per­tam­ina, in an ef­fort to un­seat him.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Mr Ba­suki’s video, Per­tam­ina’s spokesman Fa­jriyah Us­man told the cn­nin­done­sia.com news por­tal that the com­pany re­spects the state­ment made by Mr Ba­suki, whose job is to su­per­vise the firm’s man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Us­man added that the com­pany is un­der­go­ing in­ter­nal re­struc­tur­ing for im­prove­ment.</p>
