    <p>Videos of a group of at least six women and a man were up­loaded on so­cial me­dia on Sun­day, when they al­legedly held a party at a Sen­tosa ho­tel to cel­e­brate the 33rd week of preg­nancy of one of the women.</p>
    <p>Another investigat­ion has been launched over a pos­si­ble breach of safety mea­sures at a ho­tel at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS).</p>
    <p>Videos of a group of at least six women and a man were up­loaded on so­cial me­dia on Sun­day, when they al­legedly held a party to cel­e­brate the 33rd week of preg­nancy of one of the women.</p>
    <p>Some of the women had up­loaded sev­eral videos on In­sta­gram, show­ing them­selves play­fight­ing with pil­lows and clothes on beds.</p>
    <p>So­cial gath­er­ings of more than five peo­ple are pro­hib­ited due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The New Pa­per on Mon­day, Mr Chew Tiong Heng, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of in­fra­struc­ture plan­ning and man­age­ment at the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), said it was aware of the al­leged in­ci­dent and was in­ves­ti­gat­ing.</p>
    <p>“STB takes a se­ri­ous view of any breach in safe man­age­ment mea­sures,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ho­tels are re­quired to com­ply with all safe man­age­ment mea­sures, i nclud­ing en­sur­ing that gath­er­ings do not ex­ceed five peo­ple if they are not from the same house­hold.”</p>
    <p>An RWS spokesman said it takes a se­ri­ous view of non­com­pli­ance and re­quires all guests to be reg­is­tered with the ho­tel front desk.</p>
    <p>Safe man­age­ment mea­sures are high­lighted to guests dur­ing check-in and signs are dis­played at com­mon ar­eas as a re­minder.</p>
    <p>He said: “We strongly urge all guests to strictly ob­serve and ad­here to all safe man­age­ment mea­sures for the health, safety and well-be­ing of the Sin­ga­pore com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond such gath­er­ing at RWS that has al­legedly breached safe man­age­ment rules in as many months.</p>
    <p>Last month, it was re­ported that a group of at least 10 peo­ple, mostly women, were seen drink­ing and din­ing to­gether in a ho­tel suite there. In­ves­ti­ga­tions over the in­ci­dent are be­ing done.</p>
    <p>A reader tipped off TNP on the lat­est al­leged in­ci­dent and claimed it in­volved six women and two men who held sig­nif­i­cant in­flu­ence over youth here.</p>
    <p>One of the women in­volved has about 57,000 fol­low­ers on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>The posts have all been re­moved from their In­sta­gram ac­counts.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als who breach safety mea­sures may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to six months, or both.</p>
    <p>The max­i­mum sen­tence is dou­bled for re­peat of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>Asked what pos­si­ble ac­tion may be taken if such breaches re­peat­edly oc­cur at the same lo­ca­tion, Mr Chew said ho­tels that are found to be non-com­pli­ant may face clo­sure of its premises.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that do not com­ply with the mea­sures may also be in­el­i­gi­ble for gov­ern­ment grants, loans, tax re­bates and other forms of as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>RE­QUIRED TO COM­PLY</p>
    <p>STB takes a se­ri­ous view of any breach in safe man­age­ment mea­sures. Ho­tels are re­quired to com­ply with all safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in­clud­ing en­sur­ing that gath­er­ings do not ex­ceed five peo­ple if they are not from the same house­hold.</p>
    <p>MR CHEW TIONG HENG, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of in­fra­struc­ture plan­ning and man­age­ment at the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board, say­ing it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing the al­leged in­ci­dent.</p>
