    <p>It was films such as The Tal­ented Mr Ri­p­ley (1999) and Cold Moun­tain (2004) that put Jude Law on the map as a se­ri­ous dra­matic ac­tor, the two roles also earn­ing him Os­car nom­i­na­tions for Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor and Best Ac­tor re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>But the star be­gan his ca­reer on the stage and he re­turns to those the­atri­cal roots with The Third Day, which fea­tures a stage com­po­nent that will see him per­form­ing live in an on­line broad­cast.</p>
    <p>The psy­cho­log­i­cal thriller de­buted this week on HBO Go and HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420), with new episodes ev­ery Tues­day at 9am. The six-episode drama casts Law as Sam, a trou­bled man who is stranded on a mys­te­ri­ous is­land off the Bri­tish coast, where he en­coun­ters a com­mu­nity with strange re­li­gious be­liefs.</p>
    <p>The show is co-cre­ated by Bri­tish the­atre di­rec­tor Felix Bar­rett, whose in­ter­ac­tive stage troupe Punch­drunk will per­form with Law in a the­atri­cal event to be broad­cast live on­line in Bri­tain on Oct 3. This will take place be­tween the third and fourth episodes and de­pict the events of a sin­gle day in real time, shot in one con­tin­u­ous take.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the press by video call from London re­cently, the ac­tor says the live the­atri­cal el­e­ment made the role too in­trigu­ing to pass up.</p>
    <p>“On the one hand, we were con­struct­ing this re­ally con­sid­ered and com­plex piece of tele­vi­sion. And yet at our dis­posal, we had this in­ter­pre­tive the­atre com­pany sup­port­ing us.</p>
    <p>“It’s a won­der­ful mar­riage of two medi­ums,” says the ac­tor, who also ap­peared in Guy Ritchie’s Sher­lock</p>
    <p>Holmes films (2009 and 2011) and the Harry Pot­ter spin-off Fan­tas­tic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindel­wald (2018).</p>
    <p>For The Third Day, he says screen­writer Den­nis Kelly and di­rec­tor Marc Mun­den – who col­lab­o­rated on the Bri­tish con­spir­acy thriller Utopia (2013 to 2014) – “were min­ing each mo­ment in foren­sic de­tail – what needed to be said, what was be­ing said, or have we said enough”.</p>
    <p>And after see­ing things from Sam’s point of view in the first three episodes, the au­di­ence will get the per­spec­tive of a new ar­rival on the is­land – a woman named He­len (Naomie Har­ris), who has her own emo­tional bag­gage.</p>
    <p>“The world just seemed to come alive be­cause it was be­ing looked at from so many points of view – in­clud­ing that of this the­atre com­pany, who has great ex­pe­ri­ence in cre­at­ing worlds,” Law says.</p>
    <p>“So it was an ex­tra­or­di­nary, pos­si­bly one-off ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor – who has Olivier and Tony nom­i­na­tions for tread­ing the boards on both sides of the At­lantic – also rel­ished the chance to sink his teeth into the part like he would with a play.</p>
    <p>“What was very help­ful, and some­thing that you don’t often find when mak­ing a film, was that Marc likes to re­hearse – in de­tail and quite ex­ten­sively.</p>
    <p>“I l ove re­hears­ing be­cause I started in the the­atre and, in the­atre, it is an im­por­tant part of the process.”</p>
    <p>This is how the ac­tor dug into the trauma that in­forms Sam’s murky past.</p>
    <p>“The work that I did was all based around con­struct­ing a map so I could fol­low and get in­side Sam’s grief. What it was that was trig­ger­ing him and what could hap­pen emo­tion­ally for him to black out and do things he wouldn’t re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day felt so im­mer­sive – we were out and about, in it, do­ing it,” he says.</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ter’s trauma over los­ing a child was some­thing the ac­tor felt keenly – es­pe­cially hav­ing five chil­dren him­self aged five to 23, plus a sixth on the way with his sec­ond wife, psy­chol­o­gist Philippa Coan, 33.</p>
    <p>“I def­i­nitely delved i nto and poked around stuff that I re­ally didn’t like be­ing near, par­tic­u­larly the grief and pain Sam holds with re­spect to los­ing a child.</p>
    <p>“I felt that it was my re­spon­si­bil­ity to re­ally try and un­der­stand that – if any­one ever can with­out go­ing through it.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause of this, the role took him to “a dark place and it changed me some­what”, Law adds.</p>
    <p>“So while I wasn’t happy to fin­ish this job be­cause I had a re­ally ex­tra­or­di­nary time mak­ing it, I was keen to get away from that pain – and it still lives around me a lit­tle bit.”</p>
    <p>But the ex­pe­ri­ence ul­ti­mately made him ap­pre­ci­ate what he has even more.</p>
    <p>“It put me in touch with stuff that it is im­por­tant to be in touch with, like lov­ing the fam­ily you have, mak­ing sure they know you love them and en­joy­ing ev­ery day as it comes.”</p>
    <p>The Third Day airs on HBO Go and HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420), with new episodes ev­ery Tues­day at 9am.</p>
