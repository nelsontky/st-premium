    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has placed great strain on Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially those who al­ready face fi­nan­cial and per­sonal dif­fi­cul­ties. Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) med­i­cal so­cial worker Pame­lyn Tan, 27, saw this up close with the pa­tients she en­coun­tered dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan’s clin­i­cal spe­cial­i­ties are in­ter­nal medicine, and ob­stet­rics and gy­nae­col­ogy, but, at the peak of the cri­sis, she was roped in to sup­port quar­an­tined pa­tients who had been ad­mit­ted to SGH and were await­ing their swab tests. The med­i­cal so­cial work team’s du­ties in­cluded fa­cil­i­tat­ing fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance, coun­selling, case man­age­ment and care plan­ning.</p>
    <p>Apart from the in­creased pa­tient load, Ms Tan had to “man­age new pro­files of pa­tients, and there was added com­plex­ity due to the pan­demic’s ef­fects on the psy­cho-so­cial well-be­ing of pa­tients and their fam­i­lies”.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, some pa­tients had dif­fi­culty ac­cess­ing care ser­vices. They could not hire for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers due to travel re­stric­tions, and va­can­cies for other care ser­vices were lim­ited due to the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. We had to work with com­mu­nity part­ners to ex­plore al­ter­na­tive care ar­range­ments,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing those dif­fi­cult mo­ments, Ms Tan counted on her col­leagues’ and hus­band’s sup­port. “I felt in­spired by the re­silience dis­played by pa­tients, fam­ily mem­bers and the com­mu­nity as they formed net­works to sup­port one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Working on the front lines also taught her that “life is fleet­ing”. “What is of long-last­ing worth is how we grow and im­pact oth­ers in the way we live, in­clud­ing in our work as health­care pro­fes­sion­als.”</p>
    <p>From teach­ing to so­cial work</p>
    <p>Mak­ing a dif­fer­ence in other’s lives was al­ways close to Ms Tan’s heart.</p>
    <p>Af­ter her A lev­els, she did a part­time teach­ing stint, where she taught chil­dren from fam­i­lies with per­sonal and fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>She says: “Be­sides ex­plor­ing the per­son’s feel­ings, so­cial his­tory and val­ues, so­cial work is also about look­ing at the per­son-in-en­vi­ron­ment and con­sid­er­ing how to work best with sys­tems — fam­ily, school, the work­place — to help the per­son.”</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence led her to ma­jor in so­cial work at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, where she grad­u­ated from in 2016. She was also a re­cip­i­ent of the MOH Hold­ings’ Health­care Merit Award.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan plans to pur­sue a grad­u­ate diploma in coun­selling to de­velop her knowl­edge of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence is­sues, and hone her grief coun­selling skills. “See­ing the pos­i­tive change in peo­ple’s lives makes it ful­fill­ing and worth­while,” she says.</p>
    <p>What is of long-last­ing worth is how we grow and im­pact oth­ers in the way we live, in­clud­ing in our work as health­care pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
