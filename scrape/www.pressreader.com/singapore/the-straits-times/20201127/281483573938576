    <p>Bri­tish tech­nol­ogy com­pany Dyson is plan­ning to have a new ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing hub in Sin­ga­pore as part of £2.75 bil­lion (S$4.93 bil­lion) worth of in­vest­ments in the Repub­lic, the United King­dom and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The i nvest­ments will dou­ble Dyson’s port­fo­lio of prod­ucts and go to­wards its ven­ture in new fields by 2025, with the hir­ing of ad­di­tional engi­neers in ar­eas such as soft­ware, ma­chine learn­ing and ro­bot­ics, the com­pany said in a state­ment to­day.</p>
    <p>It is putting re­sources in re­search ar­eas such as next-gen­er­a­tion mo­tor tech­nol­ogy, con­nec­tiv­ity and ma­te­rial science.</p>
    <p>Dyson said one of its pri­or­i­ties is the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of its solid state bat­tery tech­nol­ogy that is be­ing de­vel­oped in Sin­ga­pore, the UK, the United States and Ja­pan, and is said to pro­vide cleaner and more ef­fi­cient en­ergy stor­age than cur­rent bat­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s new global head of­fice at St James Power Sta­tion in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is slated to open next year, and will be ac­com­pa­nied by an ex­pan­sion of its re­search and de­vel­op­ment fa­cil­i­ties, as well as re­search labs in fields such as ma­chine learn­ing and ro­bot­ics.</p>
    <p>Dyson has around 1,200 em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore, of whom 350 are engi­neers and sci­en­tists. Over 100 engi­neers were hired here this year.</p>
    <p>The new ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing hub here will bring to­gether its var­i­ous fa­cil­i­ties and drive tech­ni­cal innovation in the field, Dyson said. It also in­tends to es­tab­lish a new univer­sity re­search pro­gramme in Sin­ga­pore to drive prod­uct de­vel­op­ment and build on its ex­ist­ing global pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Dyson cur­rently has 22 univer­sity re­search pro­grammes, in­clud­ing long­stand­ing projects with UK in­sti­tu­tions such as Ox­ford Univer­sity, Im­pe­rial Col­lege London and Cam­bridge Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the com­pany is also deep­en­ing its com­mit­ment to ad­vanced ro­bot­ics re­search and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence in the UK to drive the innovation of new tech­nolo­gies and prod­ucts. The new in­vest­ments will fur­ther new re­search in fields of study such as prod­ucts for sus­tain­able healthy in­door en­vi­ron­ments, Dyson said.</p>
    <p>It is also cre­at­ing a new ded­i­cated soft­ware hub in Ala­bang, in the Philip­pines, to ac­cel­er­ate the de­vel­op­ment of new ma­chines. Dyson cur­rently has an ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­ity in the coun­try, lo­cated in Calamba. The fa­cil­ity man­u­fac­tures 13 mil­lion dig­i­tal mo­tors each year.</p>
    <p>Dyson’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Roland Krueger said the in­vest­ments and ex­pan­sion in the three coun­tries are a vi­tal step in the com­pany’s de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Now is the time to in­vest in new tech­nolo­gies such as en­ergy stor­age, ro­bot­ics and soft­ware, which will drive per­for­mance and sus­tain­abil­ity in our prod­ucts for the ben­e­fit of Dyson’s cus­tomers,” he added.</p>
