    <p>With the coro­n­avirus pan­demic chang­ing al­most ev­ery as­pect of life, job seek­ers are now hav­ing to adapt to com­pa­nies’ new hir­ing pro­cesses. Go­ing on­line in re­cruit­ment has brought both ben­e­fits and chal­lenges for em­ploy­ers and job seek­ers, said hir­ing ex­perts.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus pan­demic chang­ing al­most ev­ery as­pect of life, job seek­ers are now hav­ing to adapt to com­pa­nies’ new hir­ing pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Go­ing on­line in re­cruit­ment has brought both ben­e­fits and chal­lenges for em­ploy­ers and job seek­ers, said hir­ing ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers might face longer in­ter­view pro­cesses and more com­pe­ti­tion for roles, as com­pa­nies put the brakes on hir­ing and more peo­ple look for work due to re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by re­cruit­ment agency Rand­stad in June and July found that the hir­ing process took one to three months for about 40 per cent of re­spon­dents, as com­pa­nies re­ceive more ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Jaya Dass, Rand­stad’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore, noted: “There are def­i­nitely fewer face-to-face in­ter­views tak­ing place this year, as many com­pa­nies have adopted strict mea­sures to limit phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, video in­ter­views have their lim­i­ta­tions. It’s dif­fi­cult to gauge a can­di­date’s per­son­al­ity and work­ing style... Can­di­dates will also have to make more move­ments to show that they are in­ter­ested in the job, as some of the en­ergy and body lan­guage get lost in trans­la­tion over video.”</p>
    <p>She added that due to a lack of phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion, some em­ploy­ers also ask can­di­dates to take a psy­cho­me­t­ric as­sess­ment – a test of per­son­al­ity char­ac­ter­is­tics and cog­ni­tive abil­i­ties – to de­ter­mine if they are a good fit for the job and the com­pany cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Man­pow­erGroup Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager Linda Teo said that be­sides such as­sess­ments, job seek­ers at some com­pa­nies also have to go through more in­ter­views with dif­fer­ent peo­ple within the or­gan­i­sa­tion, as the hir­ing man­agers want to gather more opin­ions be­fore mak­ing a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese, plus tight­ened hir­ing bud­gets, have re­sulted in com­pa­nies tak­ing a longer time to make a de­ci­sion as they want to en­sure they are hir­ing the right ta­lent. Some com­pa­nies have also changed to do­ing on­board­ing on­line to re­duce the need for phys­i­cal meet-ups,” she added.</p>
    <p>She noted that in the cur­rent mar­ket, there are more job seek­ers than po­si­tions avail­able as most com­pa­nies have re­duced hir­ing ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion for jobs has in­ten­si­fied, with an av­er­age in­crease of about 15 per cent in ap­pli­ca­tions per role, she added.</p>
    <p>Adecco Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager Be­tul Genc said the hir­ing process has been length­ened be­cause firms are tak­ing a con­ser­va­tive and cau­tious ap­proach amid the eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>She added that the firm has ob­served a 10 per cent rise in the num­ber of job seek­ers for per­ma­nent roles in the first half of the year, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>This in­crease went up to 40 per cent for tem­po­rary and con­tract roles.</p>
    <p>FastJobs Sin­ga­pore gen­eral man­ager Lim Huis­han noted that a ben­e­fit of vir­tual in­ter­views is that they can be more con­ve­nient for both re­cruiters and job hunters.</p>
    <p>But they can also face tech­ni­cal is­sues such as con­nec­tiv­ity, while those who are less tech-savvy or adapt­able to dig­i­tal tools can risk be­ing left be­hind.</p>
    <p>Some em­ploy­ers still re­quire a face-to-face in­ter­view in the next stage af­ter the video in­ter­views, to en­sure the per­son is a right fit for the role, she noted.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, to ace in­ter­views, ex­perts said can­di­dates should show­case their flex­i­bil­ity and adapt­abil­ity, be­sides speak­ing about their past jobs and ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Ms Dass said: “Be­sides the runof-the-mill achieve­ments from a typ­i­cal ca­reer, job seek­ers should speak about past ex­pe­ri­ences that demon­strate their life­long learn­ing at­ti­tude and agility in adapt­ing to a new en­vi­ron­ment, or their abil­ity to lead change or over­come an un­ex­pected and dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ms Teo noted that job seek­ers also need to ad­just to dig­i­tal tools.</p>
    <p>“They need to be fa­mil­iar with the dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy be­ing used in the hir­ing process and learn how to cap­i­talise on it to po­si­tion them­selves as can­di­dates of choice,” she said, such as tap­ping so­cial me­dia to mar­ket them­selves on­line, as well as net­work with prospec­tive em­ploy­ers and re­cruiters.</p>
    <p>“They also should learn best prac­tices for video in­ter­views to in­crease their chances of get­ting the job. Most im­por­tantly, they should spend some time to tai­lor their re­sumes to fit the role that they are ap­ply­ing for, in­stead of us­ing a generic re­sume,” she added.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers also need to do their part, by learn­ing how to eval­u­ate can­di­dates with­out re­ly­ing on phys­i­cal cues or re­sponses that are more ap­par­ent in-per­son than over video or phone, Ms Teo said.</p>
    <p>Even hu­man re­source staff and team lead­ers have to ad­just, es­pe­cially if on­board­ing a new hire is done on­line, she added.</p>
    <p>“While the new hires can col­lab­o­rate with their new team­mates over video calls, it might take a longer time for them to fos­ter work­place ca­ma­raderie due to the lack of phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>LOST IN TRANS­LA­TION</p>
    <p>Video in­ter­views have their lim­i­ta­tions. It’s dif­fi­cult to gauge a can­di­date’s per­son­al­ity and work­ing style... Can­di­dates will also have to make more move­ments to show that they are in­ter­ested in the job, as some of the en­ergy and body lan­guage get lost in trans­la­tion over video.</p>
