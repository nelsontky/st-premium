    <p>The High Court yes­ter­day found that a for­mer cabby, in­volved in an ac­ci­dent that left one of four pas­sen­gers dead, has to bear 65 per cent of the re­spon­si­bil­ity in a suit filed by one of the sur­viv­ing pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The court also found that the driver of the car that crashed into the taxi at the junc­tion of Com­mon­wealth Av­enue West and Cle­menti Road has to bear 35 per cent of the li­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>For­mer cabby Yap Kok Hua, 56, was mak­ing a dis­cre­tionary right turn when Mr Ng Li Ning, 23, who was com­ing from the op­po­site di­rec­tion in his Nis­san, crashed into the taxi.</p>
    <p>The traf­fic lights were in Mr Ng’s favour at the time, but he ad­mit­ted that he was speed­ing.</p>
    <p>The two were sued for neg­li­gence by Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore stu­dent Ting Jun Heng, 23, who now walks with a slight limp and has a speech im­ped­i­ment.</p>
    <p>The crash took the life of his fel­low un­der­grad­u­ate Kathy Ong Kai Ting, 19, who was sit­ting be­side him at the time of the ac­ci­dent on April 19, 2018.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Justice Aedit Ab­dul­lah said that the greater de­gree of re­spon­si­bil­ity lay with Mr Yap.</p>
    <p>“Pri­or­ity lay with those ve­hi­cles go­ing straight; it was in­cum­bent upon (Mr Yap) to keep a proper look­out, and ex­er­cise pru­dent judg­ment in ex­e­cut­ing the turn. If there was any doubt about whether it was safe, (Mr Yap) should have ei­ther waited for on­com­ing traf­fic to clear, or for it to be stopped and the right turn green ar­row traf­fic lights to come on,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Yap failed to do so, and just fol­lowed an­other ve­hi­cle that had turned but was not hit by on­com­ing traf­fic, said Justice Aedit.</p>
    <p>As for Mr Ng, the judge found that he failed to keep a proper look­out.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the right of way es­sen­tially means that other users should yield or give way. But, hav­ing the right of way does not ab­solve that par­tic­u­lar road user of the need to ex­er­cise due care,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>He ac­cepted the ev­i­dence of an ex­pert wit­ness who an­a­lysed video footage of the ac­ci­dent to con­clude that the av­er­age speed of the Nis­san driven by Mr Ng up to im­pact was 82kmh.</p>
    <p>The judge said that when Mr Ng came to the junc­tion and saw a ve­hi­cle turn­ing, the ap­pro­pri­ate re­ac­tion would have been to slow down, sound the horn if need be, and make sure no other ve­hi­cle was turn­ing, but he did not do so.</p>
    <p>He re­jected ar­gu­ments by both de­fen­dants that there was con­trib­u­tory neg­li­gence by Mr Ting as he had failed to wear his seat belt.</p>
    <p>The quan­tum of dam­ages will be de­ter­mined at a sep­a­rate hear­ing and will be borne by the de­fen­dants’ in­sur­ers.</p>
