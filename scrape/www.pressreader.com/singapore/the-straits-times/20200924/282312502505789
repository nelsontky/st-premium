    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Smart Glove Corp, a dis­pos­able glove maker in Malaysia, has se­lected banks for its planned ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) that could raise more than RM1 bil­lion (S$330 mil­lion), ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has picked Af­fin Hwang In­vest­ment Bank and RHB Bank for the po­ten­tial share sale which could take place as soon as next year, said the peo­ple, who asked not to be named as the mat­ter is pri­vate.</p>
    <p>Smart Glove could join its peers, in­clud­ing Harps Hold­ings, i n seek­ing list­ings i n Malaysia, rid­ing on in­vestor en­thu­si­asm for glove mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Shares of Malaysia’s Top Glove Corp, the world’s largest glove man­u­fac­turer, have soared more than 400 per cent this year on the back of surg­ing de­mand for med­i­cal pro­tec­tive gear amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Mean­while, the bench­mark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI In­dex has fallen about 5 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Smart Glove makes gloves for the med­i­cal and food and bev­er­age in­dus­tries, among oth­ers, ac­cord­ing to its web­site. Founded in 1994, it has op­er­a­tions in Malaysia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>De­lib­er­a­tions on the po­ten­tial IPO are at an early stage and de­tails in­clud­ing size and tim­ing could still change, the peo­ple said. Rep­re­sen­ta­tives for Af­fin Hwang and RHB Bank de­clined to com­ment. A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Smart Glove did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
