    <p>PETALING JAYA • Malaysia’s for­mer de­fence min­is­ter Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi has said he will give his full co­op­er­a­tion to help Par­lia­ment’s Pub­lic Ac­counts Com­mit­tee (PAC) in its in­ves­ti­ga­tion into a RM9 bil­lion (S$3 bil­lion) lit­toral com­bat ship project.</p>
    <p>It has been re­ported that the govern­ment paid RM5.94 bil­lion to con­trac­tor Boustead Naval Ship­yard (BNS) for the project that was com­mis­sioned in 2014.</p>
    <p>The first of the ships, meant to pa­trol Malaysia’s coastal waters, was set to be de­liv­ered in April last year. But none of the ships has been built.</p>
    <p>Zahid said the con­trac­tor’s failure to de­liver the ships was high­lighted only last year, long af­ter his ten­ure as de­fence min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“I would also like to state that th­ese ships are be­ing tasked to BNS, which is owned by Boustead Hold­ings Ber­had, and two of its largest share­hold­ers are the Armed Forces Fund Board and Re­tire­ment Inc Fund, both of which be­long to the govern­ment,” he said in a state­ment yes­ter­day .</p>
    <p>The PAC is a body com­pris­ing both govern­ment and op­po­si­tion MPs set up by Par­lia­ment to look into govern­ment spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Zahid also said the con­tract was awarded in ac­cor­dance with the Guide­lines for Ap­pli­ca­tion of Di­rect Ne­go­ti­a­tion Pro­cure­ment, which state that the pro­cure­ment of pro­jects, par­tic­u­larly by way of di­rect ne­go­ti­a­tion, can be made only upon ap­proval by the Fi­nance Min­istry, not the de­fence min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>On the is­sue of late de­liv­ery fees last year, Zahid said the De­fence Min­istry had clar­i­fied that it had for­warded a let­ter of de­mand to re­cover the fees from the re­spon­si­ble party to a con­trol­ling of­fi­cer for ap­proval, but it was to no avail.</p>
    <p>“Lastly, I be­lieve that the Min­istry of De­fence had also made clarificat­ions on the is­sue of pro­gres­sive pay­ments. I strongly af­firm that the pay­ments were made in 2019 when I was not the Min­is­ter of De­fence.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, I had no knowl­edge and con­trol over any de­ci­sions made by the min­istry to pro­ceed with the pro­gres­sive pay­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>He said he un­der­stood that PAC is re­spon­si­ble for en­hanc­ing and main­tain­ing the govern­ment struc­ture and ad­min­is­tra­tive frame­work of ac­count­abil­ity in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, I strongly be­lieve that PAC should ex­er­cise more cau­tion to dis­close de­tails of the on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion, par­tic­u­larly on mat­ters of na­tional se­cu­rity, es­pe­cially when this is at an in­ves­tiga­tive stage and no find­ings have been es­tab­lished yet.</p>
    <p>“This con­tention, how­ever, should not and will not de­feat my in­ten­tion in giv­ing full co­op­er­a­tion and my best abil­ity to as­sist the com­mit­tee in the on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion, “added Zahid, who was also a for­mer deputy prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, PAC chair­man Wong Kah Woh said in Par­lia­ment that sev­eral in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing Zahid, would be ques­tioned by PAC over the project.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also said for­mer navy chief ad­mi­ral Ab­dul Aziz Jaa­far and a rep­re­sen­ta­tive from BNS will be ques­tioned in the pro­ceed­ings that will re­sume early next month, fol­lowed by a visit to the ship con­struc­tion site in Lu­mut, Perak.</p>
