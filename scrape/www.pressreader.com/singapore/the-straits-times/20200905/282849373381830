    <p>Mr James Wong is all of 31, but prefers mu­sic from the 1960s and 1970s and cars of the same vin­tage – thanks to his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“My dad had a few se­cond-hand Mercedes cars in the 1990s and al­ways loaded his favourite mu­sic CDs in them,” says Mr Wong, who helps run the fam­ily busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“The Mercs weren’t al­ways re­li­able, but they were quiet, spa­cious and com­fort­able. These early ex­pe­ri­ences left last­ing im­pres­sions. Be­cause of this, I read more about Ger­man cars on­line and learnt a lot from fel­low en­thu­si­asts from all over the world.”</p>
    <p>In 2014, he bought his first clas­sic, a 1974 Mercedes 350SL (R107), for $58,000. He had wanted a Mercedes W113 – a clas­sic model also known as the Pagoda – but baulked at the prices, which were eas­ily dou­ble of what he paid for the 350SL.</p>
    <p>The car “rep­re­sents the right blend of clas­sic and moder­nity”. He adds:</p>
    <p>“It has the crea­ture com­forts one needs, yet is still built like a tank and the doors close like a bank vault.”</p>
    <p>It was avail­able with straight-six en­gines, but Mr Wong picked a 3.5-litre V8 with a man­ual gear­box – a rare com­bi­na­tion here.</p>
    <p>The car had 200hp when it was new, but its fuel in­jec­tion sys­tem de­te­ri­o­rated over the years, re­sult­ing in a drop in out­put.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Mr Wong re­placed the old sys­tem with a Pertronix elec­tronic in­jec­tion sys­tem, which largely re­stored power and re­li­a­bil­ity to the 46-year-old en­gine.</p>
    <p>The car is reg­is­tered un­der the Clas­sic Ve­hi­cle Scheme, which comes with con­ces­sions for road tax and cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment re­newals. But the car can be used for only 45 days a year.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong says the 350SL func­tions as a three-in-one car: “I like that it is a hard-top, soft-top and open-top car bun­dled into one.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “It is so well-de­signed that the can­vas top, when folded down, doesn’t eat into boot space.</p>
    <p>It looks best top­less and I al­ways smile in amaze­ment that this beau­ti­ful car is still run­ning on our roads. Be­ing able to look good in 1974 and 2020 is the mark of great de­sign.”</p>
    <p>It brings joy to oth­ers as well. “I took part in a char­ity drive where we gave rides to the el­derly. They were so happy to be in cars that they re­mem­ber from their era,” he says.</p>
    <p>He had the car when he was court­ing his wife, Grace, 30. They mar­ried in 2016 and have a 17-mon­thold son.</p>
    <p>“She has al­ways sup­ported me in my pas­sion and has even learnt some terms such as V6 and rear­wheel-drive,” he says. “We would even spend dates at­tend­ing au­to­mo­tive-re­lated events. I’m so glad she also prefers old cars.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who grad­u­ated with a busi­ness man­age­ment de­gree from King’s Col­lege, Lon­don, pre­vi­ously worked in the mo­tor­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>When he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in 2013, he landed a pub­lic re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions job with Volk­swa­gen Sin­ga­pore. He moved to</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce Mo­tor Cars in 2014, and then to Porsche Asia Pa­cific in 2016, tak­ing up the same role.</p>
    <p>He felt then that he had the ideal job, one which al­lowed him to be close to cars.</p>
    <p>But last year, he made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to leave that be­hind to help with his fam­ily in­vest­ments. His fa­ther, 69, felt he was get­ting on in years and wanted “an un­der­study”. At least he still has a car he loves. “The 350SL rekin­dles a sense of nos­tal­gia from my child­hood, but at the same time, it builds new mem­o­ries for my life ahead,” he says. “It’s re­mark­able how a car can have this in­tan­gi­ble sen­ti­men­tal value.”</p>
