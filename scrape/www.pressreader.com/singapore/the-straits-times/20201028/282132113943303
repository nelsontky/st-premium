    <p>Dis­traught af­ter a road ac­ci­dent left his eight-year-old daugh­ter in a coma, Mr Eric Tan has been spend­ing all his time in the in­ten­sive care unit at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal, wait­ing for her to wake up.</p>
    <p>Love­lynn, the el­der of his two daugh­ters, suf­fered a head in­jury and frac­tured both her legs.</p>
    <p>It was only when a friend of­fered to help raise funds for the med­i­cal bills did Mr Tan, 45, con­sider the cost of his daugh­ter’s treat­ment.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the re­sponse has been over­whelm­ing.</p>
    <p>“My phone has been ring­ing non­stop with peo­ple check­ing how they can help... I al­ways knew Sin­ga­pore­ans are good and have a strong sense of good­will, but I did not ex­pect the over­whelm­ing re­sponse and sup­port com­ing from the pub­lic,” said the op­er­a­tions man­ager, who works in trans­port and lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>“Right now, my main con­cern is my daugh­ter. My wife and I are just fo­cus­ing on her. We didn’t think about the bills un­til my friend of­fered to help raise money.”</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent that oc­curred last Fri­day night in Wood­lands Av­enue 12 to­wards the Sele­tar Ex­press­way in­volved a van and a red Audi car.</p>
    <p>Love­lynn was trav­el­ling in the van with her un­cle, 56, who was driv­ing, two cousins and her younger sis­ter, Lovelle, six.</p>
    <p>In-car camera footage of the crash from another car and videos from other driv­ers of its af­ter­math were posted on so­cial me­dia over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The videos show the red Audi trav­el­ling on the right side of the two-lane road be­fore it col­lides with the van, which is mak­ing a Uturn. The im­pact sends both ve­hi­cles spin­ning, and at least two peo­ple are flung out of the van, which mounts a kerb.</p>
    <p>Love­lynn and three other peo­ple were taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal. Mr Tan told Chi­nese daily Lianhe Wan­bao on Mon­day that the van driver, who was ar­rested, is his brother-in-law, and his niece, 27, and nephew, 23, were also hurt in the crash. Lovelle was un­hurt.</p>
    <p>Love­lynn was trans­ferred to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal last Fri­day night, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>His friend Andy Ang, who is or­gan­is­ing the fund-raiser, re­called see­ing the girl a day be­fore the ac­ci­dent at a tem­ple where he and Mr Tan help dec­o­rate floats for fes­ti­vals.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old is also an op­er­a­tions man­ager and in the same in­dus­try as Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>He said: “I’m def­i­nitely shocked and sad­dened by the ac­ci­dent. She is a cheer­ful and ac­tive young kid... This do­na­tion drive is run by a group of us in the floats dec­o­ra­tion team who are try­ing to help him.”</p>
    <p>As at Mon­day night, Mr Ang’s group had col­lected nearly $12,000 in do­na­tions in less than a day. They plan to stop re­ceiv­ing do­na­tions tonight.</p>
    <p>Those look­ing to do­nate can call 9029-7031 for more in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Tan: “I’m very thank­ful for peo­ple’s good­will even though right now, I’m just wait­ing for my daugh­ter to wake up.”</p>
