    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial?</p>
    <p>Lux­ury and tran­quil­lity in the heart of the city are what the Man­darin Ori­en­tal Sin­ga­pore is about. Ser­vice is flaw­less and, more im­por­tantly, warm.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel ser­vices ex­ec­u­tive Dayana Is­mail checks me in with zero fuss and takes me to my room on the 20th floor. It has a mag­nif­i­cent, floor-to-ceil­ing view of the Sin­ga­pore sky­line, Ma­rina Bay Sands and the Es­planade. I gasp with de­light.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing in a ho­tel smack in the mid­dle of town, I feel the cares of the world slip away. My plan af­ter lunch is to go to Ma­rina Square to find a nail salon that will take me in last minute. But then I spot the pool­side ca­banas and aban­don all plans. Ragged nails can wait.</p>
    <p>Af­ter lunch, I take my cof­fee and the re­mains of my glass of wine and find the shadi­est ca­bana, just off the kids’ pool. There, I put my feet up, look up at the bril­liant blue sky, con­tem­plate life, the uni­verse, ev­ery­thing and noth­ing; and promptly fall asleep.</p>
    <p>The sound of shriek­ing chil­dren wakes me from my siesta. They jeop­ar­dise la dolce vita, so I move to the main pavil­ion and re­cline deeply on a couch. A breeze blows through; the sound of chil­dren dis­ap­pears.</p>
    <p>“I want this to be my ev­ery­day,” I tell my friends in a group chat.</p>
    <p>“Don’t strain your­self,” one of them replies, com­i­cally dis­grun­tled.</p>
    <p>I won’t. Prom­ise.</p>
    <p>What’s an Ital­ian sum­mer with­out Ital­ian food?</p>
    <p>I have all my meals at Dolce Vita, the ho­tel’s Ital­ian restau­rant, and barely scratch the sur­face of the menu.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexis Mo­latte, the as­sis­tant restau­rant man­ager, and food and bev­er­age ex­ec­u­tive Ronny Foo take good care of me, as do their col­leagues.</p>
    <p>For lunch, I have Barba­bi­etola ($24), roasted beets with goat cheese and shaved hazel­nuts. The candy-striped pink and yel­low beets are beau­ti­fully sweet and sing of sum­mer.</p>
    <p>I love the Branzino ($46) too, with a caviar-stud­ded sauce, quenelles of leek com­pote and parsnip puree, and an art­ful tan­gle of green beans.</p>
    <p>At din­ner, the Trec­cia Cam­pana di Bu­fala shines. Mr Mo­latte wheels over the braided buf­falo-milk moz­zarella from Naples and slices it ta­ble­side. Each braid weighs 4kg.</p>
    <p>I have all three condi­ments – sun­dried toma­toes, an­chovies and wisps of greens. And a driz­zle of olive oil over the cheese. The cheese is sub­lime and has an al­most meaty tex­ture.</p>
    <p>Ask for the restau­rant’s bal­samic vine­gar to dip your bread in. It’s bot­tled for Dolce Vita and has per­son­al­ity, un­like some syrupy ver­sions I have had.</p>
    <p>Throw­ing cau­tion to the winds, I or­der Spaghetti ($32) and re­gret noth­ing. The pasta is made in­house and has a won­der­ful chew. It is tossed with Dat­terino toma­toes, Amalfi lemon, chilli and pars­ley, and topped with sea urchin.</p>
    <p>Alas, my ca­pac­ity is lim­ited and I re­gret not hav­ing room for chef Gior­gio Mag­gioni’s beef main course. I do, how­ever, find space for two bites of Torta della Nonna ($14), the pears on the tart sig­nalling the tran­si­tion to au­tumn.</p>
    <p>Please tell us there is a spa.</p>
    <p>The Spa at Man­darin Ori­en­tal Sin­ga­pore is full of tempt­ing treat­ments.</p>
    <p>It op­er­ates from Thurs­days to Sun­days, alas, not on the days I am at the ho­tel. I trust you will plan ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>OK, then please tell us there is a bar.</p>
    <p>Yes, and MO Bar is one of Asia’s 50 Best Bars this year. This is another tran­quil spot in the ho­tel, an invit­ing place to have pre-din­ner drinks and snacks.</p>
    <p>Let Mr Joshua Pang, food and bev­er­age op­er­a­tions ex­ec­u­tive, guide you through the menu. The cock­tails are in­spired by jour­neys and in­gre­di­ents in the Asia-Pa­cific, and are ar­ranged by al­co­holic con­tent.</p>
    <p>One thing I ap­pre­ci­ate very much is that the bar serves very good mock­tails. Try Smoked Wa­ter ($16) and you’ll know what I mean.</p>
    <p>To nib­ble on, or­der Gyu-Katsu Sando ($32), wagyu beef sand­wich done Ja­panese style us­ing house­made shoku­pan. The bread is stel­lar and holds up the juicy beef very well.</p>
    <p>Fi­nal Jour­ney ($24), made with gin, laven­der and hops, is Mr Pang’s cre­ation. I have it on ice in a wine glass, topped with a splash of soda wa­ter, as a night­cap in my room, and it is sparkly, fresh and light.</p>
    <p>I sleep like a baby.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Play tourist in your back­yard. I usu­ally start week­day morn­ings with a long walk and see no rea­son to de­vi­ate from the rou­tine.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept my walk around Ma­rina Bay is any­thing but rou­tine. Pow­ered by pasta the night be­fore, I marvel at the beau­ti­ful sculp­tures, the breath­tak­ing views. They are as stun­ning at street level as they are from on high, es­pe­cially when set against a bright blue sky streaked with clouds.</p>
    <p>I con­tem­plate a deeper foray into the CBD, but traf­fic noise and fumes put me off, and I end up walk­ing three times around the bay, dis­cov­er­ing new things each time.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, in case you have not re­alised, is beau­ti­ful. Get out there and see for your­self.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: yea or nay?</p>
    <p>Yea for sure. To look at Sin­ga­pore glowing and glam­orous at night from my room, lights twin­kling atop the spiky domes of the Es­planade, with a Ne­groni in my hand, is to be­lieve that we will bounce back. That we will be stronger when all this is over.</p>
    <p>Hot tip</p>
    <p>Af­ter din­ner, head back to MO Bar for a night­cap and or­der Lan­tern ($22), a cock­tail made with gin, cu­cum­ber and a drop of chicken stock. It is served in a lit-up cup, which glows beau­ti­fully in the dim light of the bar.</p>
    <p>Be warned, though: You might have an in­ex­pli­ca­ble long­ing for chicken rice.</p>
