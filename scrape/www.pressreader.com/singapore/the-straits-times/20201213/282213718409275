    <p>As a re­searcher work­ing on Covid treat­ments, the past few months have been hec­tic. While work­ing from home, there has been no mean­ing­ful break, or even dis­tance, phys­i­cally or lit­er­ally, from the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Life has taken on a mono­chrome tint. Days and weeks have merged into an amor­phous glob. And as Christ­mas ap­proaches, I think of this year as one in which ma­jor life events and mile­stones went un­marked.</p>
    <p>The only peo­ple I see reg­u­larly are the ones who live within, or in the vicin­ity, of my home. I miss the serendip­i­tous en­coun­ters, ca­sual con­ver­sa­tions and un­planned ex­cur­sions that were in­te­gral to my work­ing hours. The part of me that is nur­tured by the full­ness of life around me is try­ing to fill the void with some­thing else.</p>
    <p>En­ter 11-11 sales. Black Fri­day. Hol­i­day dis­counts. And a rea­son for re­venge buy­ing. My closet now holds ex­pen­sive clothes, a fancy wal­let and a quirky poster to cap­ture my travel his­tory. A phe­nom­e­non which is the an­tithe­sis of my ap­proach to a mod­er­ate life.</p>
    <p>YEAR FOR IN­DUL­GENCE</p>
    <p>“Col­lect mo­ments, not things,” it is said.</p>
    <p>How can I ac­cu­mu­late mem­o­rable mo­ments when life feels like we’re all stuck on an air­plane placed on a pro­longed hold­ing pat­tern with no sign of land­ing in the near fu­ture? Add to that the feel­ing of in­evitabil­ity, the pos­si­bil­ity of im­mi­nent mor­tal­ity, and of the fu­til­ity of my work.</p>
    <p>Ac­quir­ing ma­te­rial pos­ses­sions seems to al­lay some of my de­spon­dency, although I know that ob­jects are only as valu­able as the price we place on them, usu­ally through emo­tional con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>Even as I cob­ble to­gether the few items that I can phys­i­cally col­lect (Swarovski ear­rings) or count as note­wor­thy ex­pe­ri­ences (Mas­ter­class sub­scrip­tion) in 2020, I recog­nise that my re­cent un­char­ac­ter­is­tic shop­ping spree is prob­a­bly in re­sponse to this un­prece­dented time in his­tory, and can­not di­rectly be at­trib­uted to any fun­da­men­tal change in per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>This has been a year of adapt­ing and chang­ing with the times. A few months ago, we had a muted cel­e­bra­tion to mark my el­der daugh­ter’s col­lege grad­u­a­tion, a far cry from what I had been plan­ning for this mile­stone. In the next few weeks, we are plan­ning to go on a cruise to nowhere, a friv­o­lous hol­i­day to mark a year of no travel.</p>
    <p>There are years that call for aus­ter­ity and years that call for in­dul­gence. The year 2020 has de­manded both.</p>
    <p>I will try to keep this in mind as I browse fes­tive of­fers now and re-read the min­i­mal­ism e-mails next month.</p>
