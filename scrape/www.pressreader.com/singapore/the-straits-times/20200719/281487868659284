    <p>A gen­eral elec­tion called amid a pan­demic and as a re­ces­sion looms would nor­mally be ex­pected to re­sult in a flight to safety and a surge in vote share for the rul­ing party. But the out­come of GE2020 held nine days ago con­founded that.</p>
    <p>A sig­nif­i­cant vote swing of 8.7 per­cent­age points against the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party took its over­all vote share to 61.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>The PAP saw its vote share sink fur­ther in Work­ers’ Party-held Alju­nied GRC, and lost a sec­ond GRC, Sengkang, to the WP, which saw a record 10 MPs elected.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing party’s share of the na­tional vote came as a sur­prise to many ac­tivists and ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Some called it the worst-ever elec­tion re­sult – with 10 elected op­po­si­tion con­stituency MPs – that had to be re­garded as a dis­as­ter for the Gov­ern­ment, as well as its fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship that has been play­ing a greater role in run­ning the coun­try and the elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a closer look at the swing and vote share na­tion­wide go­ing back to the 1970s sug­gests that GE2020 marks a re­turn to the norm of the mid-1980s and 1990s, when the PAP got be­tween 61 per cent and 65 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>There was a swing back to this norm in GE2011, which some an­a­lysts de­scribed as the start of a “new nor­mal” vote range for the PAP.</p>
    <p>GE2015 up­ended that with a vote share of nearly 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is: Does GE2020 mark a re­turn to the norm of the low- to mid-60s range, or might it be the start of a “new nor­mal” where the PAP’s vote share isn’t a given and could even go be­low 60 per cent?</p>
    <p>In­sight looks at five fac­tors.</p>
    <p>SHARP SWINGS IN THE PAST</p>
    <p>The 8.7 per­cent­age point swing is not the most sig­nif­i­cant down­ward dip in the rul­ing party’s 61 years in power. That was in GE1972, which saw a 16.3 per­cent­age point drop in the PAP’s vote share to 70.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Granted, the elec­tion be­fore that, in 1968, was an anom­aly with the main op­po­si­tion party, Barisan Sosialis, boy­cotting the elec­tion and only seven out of 58 seats con­tested.</p>
    <p>And in the two elec­tions af­ter that 1972 re­sult, the PAP man­aged to re­v­erse the slide, get­ting 74.1 per cent and 77.7 per cent of the na­tional vote in GE1976 and GE1980 re­spec­tively and en­sur­ing a clean sweep of all the seats.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the roll-out of one con­tro­ver­sial pol­icy af­ter an­other in 1984 – from steps to favour grad­u­ate moth­ers to a re­port that pro­posed rais­ing the re­tire­ment age from 55 to 60, then 65 and con­se­quently push­ing back the age when peo­ple could with­draw their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund sav­ings – caused sig­nif­i­cant dis­quiet.</p>
    <p>As con­tro­ver­sial was the in­tro­duc­tion of the Non-Con­stituency MP scheme, which would guar­an­tee a min­i­mum of three op­po­si­tion mem­bers should there be fewer than that num­ber elected. Crit­ics saw it as a salve to younger vot­ers’ wish for some op­po­si­tion pres­ence in the House to check the PAP.</p>
    <p>These con­trib­uted to a 12.8 per­cent­age point drop in the PAP’s vote share in GE1984 to 64.8 per cent. For the first time since in­de­pen­dence, the PAP lost two seats to the op­po­si­tion in what was called a “wa­ter­shed” elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr J.B. Je­yaret­nam of the Work­ers’ Party re­tained An­son with 56.8 per cent of the votes, up from 51.9 per cent when he first won it in the 1981 by-elec­tion. And Mr Chiam See Tong of the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party won Po­tong Pasir with 60.3 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>While the PAP re­tained 77 out of 79 seats (30 of them were walkovers), the dis­ap­point­ment on the faces of many of its lead­ers – used to clean sweeps – was pal­pa­ble. A head­line cap­tur­ing the mood as votes were tal­lied read: “Night the win­ners felt like losers... while their op­po­nents ex­ulted in their gains”.</p>
    <p>That down­ward swing saw the can­did ad­mis­sion by younger party lead­ers that the PAP’s elec­tion strat­egy was wrong in a con­fi­den­tial post-mortem re­port on GE1984, made avail­able to the au­thors of Men In White, a his­tory of the party pub­lished in 2009.</p>
    <p>The re­port said the party had to re­vamp its im­age, en­gage peo­ple emo­tion­ally, and stop harp­ing on the qual­ity of its can­di­dates as this re­in­forced the per­cep­tion that its su­per-achiev­ers were too re­moved from the ground.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, it also said the PAP had to ac­cept that “the op­po­si­tion is here to stay” – and the party should try to main­tain a large and sta­ble ma­jor­ity rather than elim­i­nate the op­po­si­tion al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>THAT TWO-THIRDS CEIL­ING</p>
    <p>The stage for a 61.2 per cent vote share was set 36 years ago.</p>
    <p>GE1984 marked the start of a new trend where the PAP would strug­gle to get more than two-thirds of all valid votes cast. This proved to be the case in seven out of nine gen­eral elec­tions, in­clud­ing that year’s.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, the op­po­si­tion could gen­er­ally be as­sured of get­ting at least one-third of the votes – pro­vided it did the ground­work.</p>
    <p>GE1988 and GE1991 saw fur­ther slides in the PAP’s vote share to</p>
    <p>63.2 per cent and 61 per cent.</p>
    <p>One fac­tor cited for the 1991 out­come was the by-elec­tion strat­egy adopted by the op­po­si­tion to in­crease its vote share by con­test­ing less than half of all seats, thereby re­turn­ing the PAP to power on Nom­i­na­tion Day.</p>
    <p>The think­ing was this: Vot­ers would be more will­ing to sup­port the op­po­si­tion as there is no dan­ger of in­ad­ver­tently vot­ing the Gov­ern­ment out of power. They could then have their cake and eat it – a PAP Gov­ern­ment, as well as an op­po­si­tion that would be a check and bal­ance on the dom­i­nant rul­ing party.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy seemed to work. In Po­tong Pasir, Mr Chiam got a record high 69.6 per cent of the votes in GE1991, and the PAP lost three more seats – the WP’s Mr</p>
    <p>Low Thia Khi­ang won Hougang with 52.8 per cent of the votes, the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party’s (SDP) Mr Ling How Doong won Bukit Gom­bak with 51.4 per cent of the votes, and the SDP’s Mr Cheo Chai Chen won Nee Soon Cen­tral with 50.3 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>But these wins were not ir­re­versible.</p>
    <p>In­fight­ing within the SDP and mis­man­age­ment of es­tates by Mr Ling and Mr Cheo saw the PAP win</p>
    <p>A closer look at the swing and vote share na­tion­wide go­ing back to the 1970s sug­gests that GE2020 marks a re­turn to the norm of the mid-1980s and 1990s, when the PAP got be­tween 61 per cent and 65 per cent of the votes. There was a swing back to this norm in GE2011, which some an­a­lysts de­scribed as the start of a “new nor­mal” vote range for the PAP.</p>
    <p>back both their seats con­vinc­ingly at the next elec­tion.</p>
    <p>GE1997 also saw the PAP in­crease its vote share to a level above 1984 – 65 per cent – partly a nod to sec­ond prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong’s more con­sul­ta­tive style of gov­er­nance. Im­prove­ments on the ground and link­ing pri­or­ity in es­tate up­grad­ing to the level of sup­port for the PAP also played a part.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Hougang bucked the trend. Mr Low saw his share of the vote rise to 58 per cent, whereas in Po­tong Pasir, Mr Chiam’s vote share slid to 55.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Ling man­aged 28.4 per cent, while Mr Cheo got 38.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The elec­tions of the 1980s and 1990s showed that the op­po­si­tion could be as­sured of at least be­tween 25 per cent and 30 per cent sup­port.</p>
    <p>And while the PAP could be as­sured of around 40 per cent, at best, un­der two-thirds of the elec­torate were pre­pared to give their back­ing.</p>
    <p>OUT­LIERS IN THE 2000s</p>
    <p>Two atyp­i­cal elec­tions within the last 20 years may have coloured ex­pec­ta­tions of what a strong man­date is.</p>
    <p>GE2001, called in the wake of the Sept 11 ter­ror at­tacks in the United States and in the mid­dle of a global re­ces­sion, saw a flight to safety, with vot­ers giv­ing the PAP 75.3 per cent of the votes. How­ever, only 29 of the 84 seats were con­tested that year, with the WP con­test­ing two.</p>
    <p>The other un­ex­pected re­sult was GE2015, which fol­lowed a tar­geted ef­fort by the Gov­ern­ment to ad­dress hot-but­ton is­sues in the wake of GE2011.</p>
    <p>The sur­pris­ing 69.9 per cent vote share that year has been pinned down to the feel-good ef­fect of SG50 cel­e­bra­tions, and the death of found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew giv­ing many pause to re­flect on the PAP and the role it played in keep­ing Sin­ga­pore suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>In a way, both high scores had en­er­gised an op­po­si­tion seek­ing to deny the rul­ing party a clean sweep. The lat­est hus­tings saw var­i­ous par­ties raise the spec­tre of a wipe-out of op­po­si­tion con­stituency MPs, which helped swing un­de­cided vot­ers round.</p>
    <p>The af­ter­math of GE2001 saw a rein­vig­o­rated op­po­si­tion, with the WP un­der Mr Low’s lead­er­ship and the SDP step­ping up its walk­a­bouts in con­stituen­cies they were tar­get­ing to con­test, and com­ing up with pol­icy pro­pos­als and a man­i­festo.</p>
    <p>GE2006 was the first time in four elec­tions that the PAP was not re­turned to power on Nom­i­na­tion Day, with 47 out of 84 seats con­tested.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the May polls, for­mer PAP chair­man Tony Tan – who would go on to be Pres­i­dent from 2011 to 2017 – said: “Nor­mally we will get be­tween 60 and 65 per cent and that will be a very good re­sult.”</p>
    <p>When the votes were counted, the PAP’s vote share was 66.6 per cent – above this range, but a down­ward swing of 8.7 per­cent­age points nonethe­less, and the same swing from GE2015 to GE2020.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan noted that while the PAP Gov­ern­ment’s per­for­mance had put it in a favourable po­si­tion with vot­ers, “there’s a mood for change in Sin­ga­pore – which is not bad”.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple are rest­less, some of the younger peo­ple would like to see more com­pe­ti­tion, per­haps con­tro­versy and more ex­change in Par­lia­ment. So this will be help­ful to the op­po­si­tion. But this is one part of an evolv­ing so­ci­ety and we have to take the changes as they come.”</p>
    <p>GE2011 saw even greater con­tes­ta­tion, as the op­po­si­tion at­tempted to fight all 87 seats but did not man­age to get the pa­per­work sub­mit­ted in time to have a team stand in Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC.</p>
    <p>But a cock­tail of griev­ances, in­clud­ing is­sues over hous­ing, trans­port and im­mi­gra­tion, in the lead-up to the gen­eral elec­tion saw the PAP get its low­est share of the pop­u­lar vote since in­de­pen­dence – 60.1 per cent – in the 82 con­tested seats, and the loss of Alju­nied GRC to the WP.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was still – just – within the 60 per cent to 65 per cent range. But it saw the Gov­ern­ment re­dou­ble ef­forts to ad­dress hot-but­ton is­sues such as hous­ing, trans­port and im­mi­gra­tion, and en­gage ci­ti­zens more widely – moves that helped ex­plain the surge in sup­port for it in GE2015.</p>
    <p>A DIS­TINCT GROUNDSWEL­L</p>
    <p>That 2015 surge in sup­port, an­a­lysts be­lieved, was not sus­tain­able. But nei­ther was the pre­vi­ous slide in sup­port last­ing.</p>
    <p>The PAP’s vote share in GE2020 – 61.2 per cent – is a whisker higher than that in GE1991, mak­ing it the third low­est to date.</p>
    <p>The loss of a sec­ond GRC – on the back of greater sup­port for the WP in Alju­nied GRC and Hougang – is also sig­nif­i­cant. What should one make of the out­come?</p>
    <p>The re­sult is not un­ex­pected, given the groundswel­l of anx­i­ety and anger that emerged in the lead-up to GE2020 over the de­ci­sion to call an elec­tion while the Covid-19 pan­demic is still rag­ing, as well as con­cerns over jobs and com­pe­ti­tion with im­mi­grant PMETs, and the de­sire for checks and bal­ances in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists note that the sharpest swings in sup­port away from the PAP took place in pri­vate hous­ing es­tates where 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion live. Many dwellers are pro­fes­sion­als fac­ing dis­rup­tion and com­pe­ti­tion for jobs, or who run small and medium-sized busi­nesses that were badly hit by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral sin­gle seats that were made up largely of HDB es­tates such as MacPher­son, Radin Mas and Yuhua, in fact, saw the PAP get above 70 per cent of the votes – sug­gest­ing that heart­land vot­ers re­mained a key base of sup­port.</p>
    <p>In a lec­ture last Wed­nes­day, vet­eran diplo­mat Chan Heng Chee noted that the elec­toral re­sult was a vote on the last five years, the last five months and the last nine days.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers were look­ing at PAP pre­dom­i­nance or the “su­per ma­jor­ity” and how gov­er­nance and par­lia­men­tary de­bate had been con­ducted in the past term of gov­ern­ment. They did not ap­prove of the way the changes to the elected pres­i­dency and poli­cies like the fake news law, of­fi­cially called the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act, or Pofma, were in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>As for the last five months, Pro­fes­sor Chan, who is the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies’ S R Nathan Fel­low for the Study of Sin­ga­pore this year, said the vote was also on how the Covid-19 pan­demic was han­dled, cit­ing a lack of clar­ity and mi­cro­manag­ing of rules and pro­to­cols for busi­nesses. There were also grow­ing fears and anx­i­eties about jobs.</p>
    <p>And in the last nine days of the cam­paign, it was about mes­sag­ing, com­mu­ni­cat­ing and the on­line pres­ence and savvi­ness of the par­ties.</p>
    <p>Some would ar­gue that the PAP has done well in re­tain­ing its share of the votes at a min­i­mum of 60 per cent for 36 years, de­spite a much stronger op­po­si­tion, a more ques­tion­ing elec­torate, and a more chal­leng­ing global en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Yet many ac­tivists and sup­port­ers are con­cerned about the 8.7 per­cent­age point swing, per­haps with good rea­son.</p>
    <p>One com­mon view is that it could have been wider had the PAP not made late tac­ti­cal de­ploy­ments to its East Coast GRC and West Coast GRC slates.</p>
    <p>While the East Coast PAP team led by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat – who moved from the safer seat of Tampines GRC – got 53.4 per cent of the votes, ac­tivists be­lieve the GRC could have swung to the WP had it been helmed by an­other min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, the 51.68 per cent win by the West Coast PAP team led by Min­is­ter S. Iswaran against the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) team led by for­mer PAP stal­wart</p>
    <p>Tan Cheng Bock might have been slim­mer were it not strength­ened by a sec­ond min­is­ter, Mr Des­mond Lee, who came over from Jurong GRC.</p>
    <p>To set things in con­text, a fur­ther slide of 8.7 per­cent­age points in the next elec­tion could see the loss of four GRCs – East Coast and Ma­rine Pa­rade, West Coast and Chua Chu Kang – and three SMCs: Bukit Pan­jang, Bukit Ba­tok and Mary­mount.</p>
    <p>That would see a to­tal of 32 op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment, as­sum­ing the WP re­tains Alju­nied, Sengkang and Hougang – enough to deny the PAP the two-thirds ma­jor­ity re­quired to amend the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>It is a prospect that might alarm long­stand­ing PAP ac­tivists and sup­port­ers, but one a grow­ing num­ber of vot­ers ap­pear will­ing to ac­cept.</p>
    <p>TOUGHER CON­TESTS AHEAD</p>
    <p>A look at the clos­est con­tests in GE2020 sug­gests that core sup­port for the PAP in var­i­ous con­stituen­cies has been on the de­cline, and may con­tinue on this tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, at least 40 per cent to 50 per cent of vot­ers in a seat tend to back the PAP, with about 25 per cent to 30 per cent root­ing for the op­po­si­tion – though this can be higher if es­tab­lished par­ties like the WP are con­test­ing.</p>
    <p>The swing vot­ers in the mid­dle – many of whom tend to be younger but in­clude mid­dle-aged vot­ers – were crit­i­cal in the WP’s win­ning Sengkang GRC, hold­ing on to Alju­nied GRC and Hougang by stronger mar­gins, as well as in sin­gle seats such as Bukit Ba­tok, Bukit Pan­jang and Mary­mount which saw size­able swings away from the PAP.</p>
    <p>The largest swing was in West Coast GRC, as large as 27 per­cent­age points from GE2015. Seen against the GE2011 re­sult, this is down to 15 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>Bukit Pan­jang SMC, where a pop­u­lar back­bencher new to the seat, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, was up against the SDP chair­man, in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist Paul Tam­byah, saw a 14 per­cent­age point swing. This was whit­tled down to 12.5 per­cent­age points when com­pared with the GE2011 re­sult.</p>
    <p>But the pic­ture is not even across con­stituen­cies – and lo­cal fac­tors could play a part.</p>
    <p>Take the new Sengkang GRC, where the WP has been ac­tive on the ground and won a de­ci­sive 52.12 per cent of the votes against a PAP team with three of­fice-hold­ers, two of whom were fairly new to the area. The larger pro­por­tion of young vot­ers, and the ab­sence of a woman can­di­date on the PAP team – the WP team had two – likely af­fected the out­come.</p>
    <p>Still, de­mog­ra­phy is not destiny. Nearby Pung­gol West, with a sim­i­lar de­mo­graphic make-up to Sengkang, saw one-term MP Sun Xuel­ing win 61 per cent of the votes against WP chal­lenger Tan Chen Chen.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s op­po­si­tion party land­scape is frag­mented, three main play­ers are ex­pected to con­tinue get­ting sup­port from vot­ers – the WP, PSP and SDP.</p>
    <p>The WP and SDP have been do­ing reg­u­lar out­reach on the ground in seats they have con­tested in be­tween elec­tions, and the PSP has said it will do so, too. This is a strat­egy that in­creases their fa­mil­iar­ity with vot­ers and their con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion that arises is whether 61.2 per cent or there­abouts will be­come the new nor­mal for the PAP’s vote share in fu­ture, as the op­po­si­tion en­trenches it­self?</p>
    <p>Could GE2025 see a slide be­low 60 per cent, and to the mid-50s af­ter that?</p>
    <p>Much de­pends on whether the PAP can win the hearts and minds of vot­ers all over again, the way it did in the early decades of Sin­ga­pore’s post-in­de­pen­dence his­tory.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the slide of 1984, it took the PAP three elec­tions to halt, then re­v­erse, the trend of de­cline. This time round, the forces against it – a stronger, grow­ing op­po­si­tion and a chang­ing elec­torate de­sir­ing greater po­lit­i­cal plu­ral­ism – ap­pear stronger than be­fore.</p>
    <p>The WP, in par­tic­u­lar, has seen a surge in pop­u­lar­ity, win­ning more than 50 per cent of the votes on av­er­age in con­stituen­cies it con­tested for the first time, and has seen its ap­peal to young and mid­dle-aged vot­ers grow.</p>
    <p>The move by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong to of­fi­cially des­ig­nate WP chief Pri­tam Singh as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment is seen as a nod to the per­ma­nence of an elected op­po­si­tion pres­ence.</p>
    <p>GE2020 saw an es­ti­mated 229,000 first-time vot­ers, based on the num­ber of peo­ple aged 20 to 24 as of June last year – about 8.6 per cent of the 2.65 mil­lion el­i­gi­ble vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers in their 20s and 30s make up about one-third of the elec­torate. As co­horts of mil­len­ni­als and younger vot­ers be­come el­i­gi­ble to vote in fu­ture elec­tions, their as­pi­ra­tions for more checks and bal­ances in the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem could sway votes in close con­tests.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen whether such vot­ers will switch par­ties as their life cir­cum­stances change.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pect our mil­len­ni­als will con­tinue to sup­port di­verse voices and an op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment as a good thing, even as they age,” said Prof Chan. “The in­cum­bent party will have to un­der­stand this group bet­ter to win back their vote.”</p>
    <p>But it has to also win back the votes of the mid­dle-aged and mid­dle-in­come res­i­dents it lost in GE2020, who will re­main a core vot­ing bloc for some time yet.</p>
    <p>PAP ac­tivists have said that they start pre­par­ing for the next elec­tion right af­ter the pre­vi­ous one.</p>
    <p>As op­po­si­tion party ac­tivists do the same, closer con­tests are ex­pected to be more com­mon at the next elec­tion.</p>
    <p>From now till then, all par­ties will have to fight for ev­ery vote, make them­selves known and liked, and en­gage and build trust with vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists note that the sharpest swings in sup­port away from the PAP took place in pri­vate hous­ing es­tates where 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion live. Many dwellers are pro­fes­sion­als fac­ing dis­rup­tion and com­pe­ti­tion for jobs, or who run small and medium-sized busi­nesses that were badly hit by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore’s op­po­si­tion party land­scape is frag­mented, three main play­ers are ex­pected to con­tinue get­ting sup­port from vot­ers – the WP, PSP and SDP. The WP and SDP have been do­ing reg­u­lar out­reach on the ground in seats they have con­tested in be­tween elec­tions, and the PSP has said it will do so, too. This is a strat­egy that in­creases their fa­mil­iar­ity with vot­ers and their con­cerns.</p>
