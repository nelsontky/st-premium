    <p>The Ja­panese have a term for ar­ti­sans who pur­sue per­fec­tion in their craft: shokunin.</p>
    <p>It is a la­bel that I as­so­ci­ate with TV maker Pana­sonic, which seems to be ob­sessed with pro­duc­ing tele­vi­sion sets with the best pic­ture qual­ity – some­times to the detri­ment of other qual­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Take Pana­sonic’s lat­est HZ1000 4K Oled TV for ex­am­ple. It of­fers rav­ish­ing vi­su­als through a com­bi­na­tion of Pana­sonic’s im­age pro­cess­ing and LG Dis­play’s Oled screen.</p>
    <p>Blacks have never looked more inky, while shad­owed ar­eas main­tain a good level of de­tail. Colour re­pro­duc­tion is nat­u­ral and re­al­is­tic and not overly sat­u­rated.</p>
    <p>The HZ1000 has a Film­maker mode that claims to dis­play a movie or tele­vi­sion show ac­cord­ing to the di­rec­tor’s in­tended vi­sion. This usu­ally means the TV will dis­able any ex­tra­ne­ous pro­cess­ing, es­pe­cially in terms of colour and mo­tion smooth­ing.</p>
    <p>The HZ1000’s mo­tion pro­cess­ing, dubbed In­tel­li­gent Frame Cre­ation, is su­perb. Even at its max­i­mum set­ting, the re­sult­ing video looks more nat­u­ral than com­pet­ing so­lu­tions from other TV mak­ers while main­tain­ing sharp and fluid vi­su­als. At lower lev­els, the mo­tion pro­cess­ing is sub­tle and prob­a­bly im­per­cep­ti­ble (in terms of the soap opera ef­fect) to most view­ers.</p>
    <p>The HZ1000 is also one of the few TVs on the mar­ket to sup­port all high dy­namic range for­mats, in­clud­ing the com­pet­ing HDR10+ and Dolby Vi­sion for­mats. While HDR10+ (avail­able for some Ama­zon Prime videos) is not as widely used as Dolby Vi­sion, it is still good to have.</p>
    <p>But the TV is not en­tirely flaw­less. The HZ1000’s Dolby Vi­sion IQ fea­ture, which uses an am­bi­ent light sen­sor to ad­just the TV’s bright­ness and colour, tends to favour a lower bright­ness set­ting than what I pre­fer when used in a dark room. While this prob­a­bly makes the view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence more com­fort­able for the eyes, the videos also look less punchy.</p>
    <p>The HZ1000 also has de­cent speak­ers that of­fer clear di­a­logue, but lack the depth and full­ness of a proper sound­bar. While the built-in speak­ers do not sup­port Dolby At­mos, the fea­ture is avail­able with com­pat­i­ble sound­bars and speak­ers.</p>
    <p>The HZ1000’s de­sign is more func­tional than stylish. Its swivel stand makes it look like an over­sized mon­i­tor rather than a TV, but it works well enough and has suf­fi­cient height al­lowance for a sound­bar.</p>
    <p>I can­not stand the TV re­mote, which has mushy but­tons that are hor­ren­dous to use. But I am most peeved at the lack of mod­ern con­ve­niences that I take for granted on a new smart TV.</p>
    <p>For starters, the HZ1000 does not sup­port Chrome­cast or Air­Play, so you can­not di­rectly cast con­tent from your com­put­ing de­vices to the TV. You will have to cast con­tent to a me­dia player, such as an Ap­ple TV box or a Chrome­cast don­gle, that is con­nected to the TV.</p>
    <p>The HZ1000 uses Pana­sonic’s pro­pri­etary My Home Screen 5.0 smart TV plat­form. While this plat­form’s user in­ter­face is rel­a­tively stream­lined and un­ob­tru­sive, it has far fewer apps com­pared with the An­droid TV plat­form.</p>
    <p>Al­though it has Net­flix, YouTube and Ama­zon Prime Video, there is no Spo­tify or meWatch. I doubt Pana­sonic will re­lease apps for stream­ing ser­vices HBO Max or Dis­ney+ in time for their launch in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Pana­sonic is also fall­ing be­hind other brands in mak­ing the TV the hub for a smart home. The HZ1000 does not come with a built-in vir­tual as­sis­tant such as Ama­zon Alexa or Google As­sis­tant. How­ever, you can con­trol the HZ1000 us­ing your voice via a sep­a­rate smart speaker – after a rather te­dious set-up process.</p>
    <p>Gamers also have bet­ter op­tions than the HZ1000 be­cause its four HDMI ports sup­port only the eARC and auto low-la­tency modes, but not the vari­able re­fresh rate fea­ture found in the up­com­ing Sony PlaySta­tion 5 and Xbox Se­ries X game con­soles.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the HZ1000 has top­notch pic­ture qual­ity. Per­haps the best thing is its en­try-level pric­ing for an Oled TV – $2,499 for a 55-inch model – which un­der­cuts the pric­ing of LG and Sony Oled TVs.</p>
    <p>If pic­ture qual­ity is the over­rid­ing pri­or­ity, the Pana­sonic HZ1000 4K Oled TV is an ex­cel­lent pick, es­pe­cially at its price.</p>
