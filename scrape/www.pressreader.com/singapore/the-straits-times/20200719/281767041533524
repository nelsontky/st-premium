    <p>Al­though an over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of peo­ple here said they would buy more lo­cally grown food, only around two-thirds of them can eas­ily iden­tify home-grown pro­duce.</p>
    <p>A food per­cep­tion survey com­mis­sioned by the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) and Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources (MEWR) in Jan­uary this year found that 94 per cent of 1,500 re­spon­dents said they were will­ing to buy lo­cal, but only 65 per cent could iden­tify such pro­duce when shop­ping for gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources Amy Khor shared these find­ings yes­ter­day dur­ing the first vir­tual meet­ing of a ci­ti­zens’ work group con­vened to brain­storm ideas to match de­mand for lo­cal pro­duce with sup­ply.</p>
    <p>She said there have been var­i­ous ini­tia­tives to im­prove the sup­ply of lo­cal pro­duce, high­light­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s fund­ing sup­port for the lo­cal agri-food in­dus­try. This in­cludes $144 mil­lion avail­able un­der the Sin­ga­pore Food Story R&D Pro­gramme and a $30 mil­lion “30 x 30 Ex­press” grant for farm­ers to ac­cel­er­ate their lo­cal food pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she said this must be com­ple­mented by a growth in de­mand. “In­creas­ing sup­ply is just one side of the equa­tion. If our farm­ers are will­ing to in­crease sup­ply but there is no up­take, no de­mand, then there is re­ally no in­cen­tive for the farm­ers to in­crease their lo­cal pro­duc­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Last year, MEWR an­nounced its goal for home-grown pro­duce to meet 30 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s nu­tri­tional needs by 2030, oth­er­wise known as its “30 by 30” goal.</p>
    <p>Such lo­cal food pro­duc­tion is a key strat­egy that the Repub­lic must se­ri­ously pur­sue to en­sure food security in Sin­ga­pore, added Dr Khor.</p>
    <p>The im­por­tance of food security has been un­der­scored in the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic which has dis­rupted food sup­ply chains, said Dr Khor, adding that cli­mate change can also im­pact sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it will take a “whole of na­tion ef­fort” to reach MEWR’s “30 by 30” goal, she said.</p>
    <p>“We need ideas from ci­ti­zens them­selves on how we can... co-cre­ate and co-de­liver so­lu­tions or ideas,” she said, not­ing that she was en­cour­aged by the sign-up rate for the ci­ti­zens’ work group.</p>
    <p>Close to 400 peo­ple ex­pressed in­ter­est in the work group, but only around 50 were picked for it, with par­tic­i­pants rang­ing from pro­fes­sion­als in the food in­dus­try, to stu­dents and avid gar­den­ers, she added.</p>
    <p>In the in­au­gu­ral ses­sion span­ning three hours yes­ter­day, par­tic­i­pants were split i nto smaller groups, where they were told about the cur­rent state of lo­cal food pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants will con­tinue to meet over five more sessions till Oct 24 when they will present their ideas to MEWR and SFA.</p>
