    <p>•</p>
    <p>BUENOS AIRES On the first week­end of sport­ing ac­tion since the death of Diego Maradona, sports, leagues and teams round the world paid trib­ute to the Ar­gen­tinian foot­ball leg­end on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Those who knew or had played with or against the 1986 World Cup win­ner, who died of a heart at­tack aged 60 on Wednesday, added poignant emo­tion to the com­mem­o­ra­tions of­ten held in sta­di­ums without fans.</p>
    <p>It was par­tic­u­larly stir­ring in Ar­gentina as the Primera Divi­sion staged its first matches, es­pe­cially for Gim­na­sia y Es­grima, the club coached by Maradona.</p>
    <p>His back­room staff re­signed en masse the day be­fore and tears flowed among Gim­na­sia’s play­ers dur­ing a two-minute trib­ute ahead of their away clash with Velez Sars­field.</p>
    <p>All play­ers and ref­er­ees in­volved in Satur­day’s five fix­tures walked onto their re­spec­tive pitches wear­ing Ar­gentina jer­seys with a Maradona sil­hou­ette on the front, and his iconic No. 10 and Gra­cias Diego em­bla­zoned on the back.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the open­ing whis­tle, there was a minute of ap­plause as the song La Mano De Dios or The Hand Of God, was played along with Vic­tor Hugo Mo­rales’ fa­mous com­men­tary of his “Goal of the Cen­tury” against Eng­land in 1986.</p>
    <p>Gim­na­sia won 1-0 to move to the top of the Group F stand­ings and the team were later filmed chant­ing his name in the dress­ing room.</p>
    <p>“We want to ded­i­cate this to our fa­ther, be­cause he was a fa­ther to us. He called us when­ever we needed some­thing and we’re happy to give him this vic­tory,” teary-eyed Gim­na­sia mid­fielder Vic­tor Ayala told TyC Sports.</p>
    <p>There was drama off the field too as re­ports emerged that his doc­tor is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for in­vol­un­tary man­slaugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The trib­utes fol­lowed sim­i­lar ges­tures in other top leagues across South Amer­ica and Europe on Satur­day. In Spain, for­mer Ar­gentina team­mate Diego Sime­one clapped dur­ing the minute’s si­lence be­fore his Atletico Madrid beat Va­len­cia 1-0 in La Liga, while in the Premier League, Ever­ton man­ager Carlo Ancelotti vis­i­bly teared up dur­ing the minute’s ap­plause.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian, who had faced Maradona dur­ing his Serie A play­ing days, said: He was my op­po­nent and he be­came my friend.”</p>
    <p>In Italy, where the play­ers all wore black arm­bands, an im­age of Maradona ap­peared dur­ing the one minute of si­lence be­fore kick­off. When his i mage ap­peared again on sta­dium screens in the 10th minute, all games were tem­po­rar­ily halted as play­ers stood and clapped for 60 sec­onds.</p>

        <p data-role="text">From one Ar&#xAD;gen&#xAD;tinian great to an&#xAD;other, Lionel Messi pays trib&#xAD;ute to the re&#xAD;cently de&#xAD;ceased Diego Maradona af&#xAD;ter scor&#xAD;ing in Barcelona&#x2019;s 4-0 win against Osasuna. Messi was wear&#xAD;ing a shirt from Newell&#x2019;s Old Boys, a for&#xAD;mer team of both play&#xAD;ers, un&#xAD;der&#xAD;neath his Barcelona jersey.</p>
