    <p>A se­rial of­fender is back in jail for cheat­ing – for the third time in eight years – af­ter she scammed vic­tims of over $900,000.</p>
    <p>Kaveena Jaya Kumar, 42, was last re­leased in Oc­to­ber 2015 and re­turned to her old ways in Au­gust 2016. Be­tween 2016 and 2018, she cheated 95 vic­tims of cash to­talling more than $900,000.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, who ap­peared in a dis­trict court via video link yes­ter­day, was sen­tenced to six years and four months’ jail af­ter she pleaded guilty to 35 counts of cheat­ing in­volv­ing more than $600,000. She also ad­mit­ted that she had mis­ap­pro­pri­ated over $15,000 that a woman had en­trusted to her.</p>
    <p>An­other 154 cheat­ing charges, in­volv­ing the re­main­ing amount, were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing the sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>To earn some money af­ter her re­lease from prison in Oc­to­ber 2015, Kaveena bought ad­mis­sion tick­ets to lo­cal at­trac­tions from a travel agency be­fore re­selling them on on­line marketplac­e Carousell.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor (DPP) Tan Zhi Hao said the profit she earned was “mar­ginal”. She then de­cided to buy the tick­ets in bulk from travel agen­cies but not make any pay­ment. She would then sell the tick­ets and keep the full amount re­ceived.</p>
    <p>She duped the travel agen­cies by hand­ing over cheques from her per­sonal bank ac­count, but with no in­ten­tion to hon­our th­ese cheques.</p>
    <p>She was caught and charged in court on Dec 3, 2016. But she con­tin­ued to re­of­fend af­ter she was bailed out a week later.</p>
    <p>Around April 2017, Kaveena owed un­li­censed money­len­ders about $100,000. To re­pay her debts, she de­cided to start a flower ar­range­ment and events man­age­ment busi­ness called The Royal Petals.</p>
    <p>DPP Tan said: “The ac­cused de­cided to use The Royal Petals as a front to per­pe­trate a flight ticket scam in­stead.”</p>
    <p>In late 2017, she lied to her cus­tomers that she could ob­tain flight tick­ets at prices lower than those of­fered by travel agen­cies. She duped them into pay­ing her even though she had no cheap flight tick­ets to sell.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “The vic­tims only re­alised they were cheated when they sought to ver­ify their de­par­ture de­tails with the air­line com­pa­nies or when they ar­rived at the air­port to check in, and they were in­formed by the air­lines that no book­ing had been made in their name.”</p>
    <p>Kaveena was jailed for 26 months in April 2012 over nine counts of cheat­ing in­volv­ing more than $55,000. In April 2014, she was jailed for three years over five cheat­ing charges linked to over $73,000.</p>
