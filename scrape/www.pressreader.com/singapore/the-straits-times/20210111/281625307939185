    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, Mr Tan Aik Wen flew to Bri­tain to begin his first term at the Univer­sity of Ox­ford. How­ever, the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion there es­ca­lated so rapidly that he de­cided to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore after just three months.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions have con­tin­ued to rise in Bri­tain as it en­tered its third na­tional lock­down last week, with 59,937 peo­ple test­ing pos­i­tive last Satur­day. A more in­fec­tious strain of the coro­n­avirus was also re­cently re­ported there.</p>
    <p>“It feels like it’s grown in­creas­ingly un­safe,” said the 21-yearold, adding that many things had changed over the past few months.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan felt racism against Asians had also in­creased since the coun­try’s Tier 4 re­stric­tions were im­posed. He had a man throw a shop­ping bas­ket and swear at him while he was gro­cery shop­ping, he said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, with the new re­stric­tions in place, his univer­sity de­cided to move classes on­line and limit ac­cess to li­brary fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Now the bal­ance has shifted be­cause there’s no more in-per­son teach­ing, li­brary fa­cil­i­ties are lim­ited, most of the Sin­ga­porean first-year com­mu­nity are go­ing back, and the rest of the univer­sity com­mu­nity won’t be al­lowed back on cam­pus un­til min­i­mally mid-Fe­bru­ary – and I be­lieve it’ll prob­a­bly ex­tend past that,” said Mr Tan, adding that it had been</p>
    <p>the “tip­ping point” for most of his peers.</p>
    <p>First-year stu­dent at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don Emma Huang said cost and safety were the two main rea­sons why she will be re­turn­ing home at the end of this month.</p>
    <p>She said it would be cheaper to pay for a swab test and the cost of re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore than con­tin­u­ing to stay and pay rent in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old added: “The cases here spiked over the De­cem­ber pe­riod and don’t seem to be go­ing down. Even though Lon­don has two vac­cines it is rolling out, I’m not sure how fast they can roll it out to the ma­jor pop­u­la­tion. At this point, the lock­down is go­ing to be till the end of March, so my par­ents want me to be back home as Sin­ga­pore is much safer.”</p>
    <p>But safety is pre­cisely why Mr Dono­van Sim, 21, is plan­ning to stay in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The first-year stu­dent at the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge said he has been “re­ally torn” about whether or not to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore since the start of the month, but fi­nally de­cided against it last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>He is not stay­ing on cam­pus cur­rently, he said, “and in or­der to fly back to Sin­ga­pore I would need to pick up some items at my col­lege first”. He added that he felt it would be best to stay put to min­imise move­ment.</p>
    <p>He also be­lieved his univer­sity’s ad­min­is­tra­tors would pre­fer it if he re­mained in the col­lege to study.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-year stu­dent at King’s Col­lege Lon­don Ria Bhar­gava, 20, too de­cided to re­main in Bri­tain de­spite be­ing wor­ried by the ris­ing in­fec­tion rate.</p>
    <p>“The changes are sud­den and there’s a lot of un­cer­tainty to deal with emo­tion­ally,” she said.</p>
    <p>Be­cause she would have to con­tinue pay­ing rent on her flat even if she re­turned to Sin­ga­pore, she de­cided it would be cheaper to re­main holed up and carry on with her stud­ies while wait­ing for the sit­u­a­tion to im­prove.</p>
    <p>There might be risk of ex­po­sure on the flight back, and given the time dif­fer­ence, it would also be a chal­lenge to study in Sin­ga­pore, she said.</p>
    <p>This was a rea­son cited by Mr Choo Yan Ru, 27, from the Univer­sity of St An­drews, who also de­cided to stay. “If the classes are on­line only, the tu­to­ri­als will be mostly at night if I were to study in Sin­ga­pore, so it might be hard to fo­cus when the rest of the house is al­ready re­lax­ing.”</p>
    <p>His univer­sity is in a small town in Scot­land and its ad­min­is­tra­tion has dis­cour­aged stu­dents from other parts of Bri­tain from re­turn­ing at the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“For now it’s still quite fea­si­ble to live an iso­lated life­style,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Bhar­gava said the vac­cine roll-out in Bri­tain gave her hope things might im­prove.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she added that if num­bers con­tinue to rise in the near fu­ture, she may change her mind.</p>
    <p>“(I know) if I were to get Covid, the help I’d get here is not as great and ef­fi­cient as what I could get in Sin­ga­pore,” she said.</p>
