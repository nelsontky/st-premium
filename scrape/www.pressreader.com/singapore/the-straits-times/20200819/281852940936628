    <p>Pro­test­ers over the week­end tar­geted the homes of mul­ti­mil­lion­aire and United States Post­mas­ter Gen­eral Louis DeJoy, who has been un­der scrutiny amid fears that his cost-cut­ting mea­sures will hold up mail-in bal­lots in Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>More peo­ple are ex­pected to hold protests across the coun­try on</p>
    <p>Satur­day, fol­low­ing small but noisy demon­stra­tions in­volv­ing hun­dreds of peo­ple at his homes in Wash­ing­ton, DC, and in</p>
    <p>Greens­boro, North Carolina. Mr DeJoy him­self will be ap­pear­ing be­fore a House Con­gres­sional Over­sight Com­mit­tee next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The con­cern is that Mr DeJoy is us­ing what he calls an “or­gan­i­sa­tional re­align­ment” to crip­ple the United States Postal Ser­vice’s (USPS) abil­ity to de­liver mail-in bal­lots on time.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures have in­cluded re­movals of sort­ing ma­chines and even, in some ar­eas, let­ter­boxes. Mail de­lays are re­port­edly al­ready tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>This would un­der­mine the postal ser­vice, which is a crit­i­cal part of the elec­tion process – in turn ra­tio­nal­is­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ar­gu­ment that the USPS can­not re­li­ably han­dle a large vol­ume of mail-in bal­lots, and that the process is vul­ner­a­ble to mas­sive fraud and thus the US is head­ing into a “rigged elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>The USPS is no or­di­nary postal ser­vice; it is the largest in the world, with more than half a mil­lion em­ploy­ees. It is a ba­sic gov­ern­ment ser­vice knit­ting to­gether even the re­motest house­holds and com­mu­ni­ties, han­dling mail across the vast coun­try. For mil­lions of re­mote fam­i­lies and com­mu­ni­ties, in­clud­ing the el­derly, the US Mail is a life­line.</p>
    <p>Many are far away from vot­ing sta­tions. Many are mo­bile, moving be­tween cities and states. These mil­lions, in­clud­ing Amer­i­can ser­vice mem­bers sta­tioned abroad, have voted by mail for many years, and no sig­nif­i­cant cases of fraud have emerged; cer­tainly none that has tipped a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent dis­tin­guishes be­tween ab­sen­tee bal­lots and mail-in bal­lots, but both in­evitably be­come con­flated. It is the USPS that is the com­mon fac­tor.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus at the hear­ing next Mon­day will be Mr DeJoy, who built his for­tune – his net worth is es­ti­mated at more than US$100 mil­lion (S$136.5 mil­lion) – in lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>While that may qual­ify him for the job of run­ning the big­gest postal ser­vice in the world, cer­tainly an­other qual­i­fi­ca­tion is that he is a Repub­li­can Party mega donor, hav­ing given a to­tal of nearly US$2.5 mil­lion to Pres­i­dent Trump and the party since 2014.</p>
    <p>Then there is also the ques­tion of con­flict of in­ter­est, given his pre­vi­ous and cur­rent busi­ness in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>From the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s per­spec­tive, Mr DeJoy is shak­ing up the USPS, which runs at a loss – US$69 bil­lion over the last 11 years.</p>
    <p>But the USPS is a ser­vice – like the mil­i­tary, or the fire ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“It is not a for-profit busi­ness,” Univer­sity of Alabama law pro­fes­sor Joyce Vance said in a we­bi­nar on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Ms Kris­ten Clarke, pres­i­dent and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Lawyers’</p>
    <p>Com­mit­tee for Civil Rights Un­der Law which hosted the we­bi­nar, said: “We are wit­ness­ing the weapon­i­sa­tion of the USPS… as a tool to pro­mote widespread voter sup­pres­sion… to si­lence vot­ers.”</p>
    <p>Se­nate Democrats on Mon­day de­manded the board that over­sees the USPS rein Mr DeJoy in and re­verse some of his ac­tions, in­clud­ing a crack­down on over­time that postal work­ers say has caused a slow­down in mail pro­cess­ing and de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>“It is crit­i­cal that you act im­me­di­ately to ad­dress ef­forts by Pres­i­dent Trump and Mr DeJoy to sab­o­tage the Postal Ser­vice,” they said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ian Brem­mer, pres­i­dent of the Eura­sia Group said via Twit­ter: “This gets us closer and closer every day to an elec­tion whose out­come is likely go­ing to be con­tested and I think that’s why this is a dom­i­nant is­sue right now.”</p>
    <p>The elec­tion is go­ing to be “in­cred­i­bly fraught and ugly”, he added.</p>
    <p>SUPPRESSIN­G VOT­ERS</p>
    <p>We are wit­ness­ing the weapon­i­sa­tion of the USPS… as a tool to pro­mote widespread voter sup­pres­sion… to si­lence vot­ers.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MS KRIS­TEN CLARKE, pres­i­dent and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Lawyers’ Com­mit­tee for Civil Rights Un­der Law.</p>
