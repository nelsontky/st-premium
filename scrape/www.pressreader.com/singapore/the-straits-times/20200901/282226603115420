    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP Den­nis Tan yes­ter­day charged that the Peo­ple’s Action Party (PAP) had en­gaged in “petty and bad pol­i­tics” dur­ing the gen­eral elec­tion, cit­ing com­plaints made over the place­ment of elec­tion posters in his Hougang ward.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s ad­dress on evolv­ing pol­i­tics, he said good pol­i­tics has to en­tail mu­tual re­spect be­tween mem­bers of the rul­ing party and other par­ties, whether in Par­lia­ment or in the con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>He re­counted how two com­plaints were made to the Elec­tions De­part­ment (ELD) dur­ing the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, over posters his party put up that were said to be be­low the min­i­mum height re­quired.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent sub­se­quently in­formed him that she saw PAP rep­re­sen­ta­tives pulling his posters lower than they had orig­i­nally been.</p>
    <p>On a sep­a­rate oc­ca­sion, the PAP team also planted party flags in front of his ban­ners, block­ing their con­tents, Mr Tan added.</p>
    <p>Th­ese made him won­der if the PAP had “gone back­wards in time” in the way it con­ducted its cam­paign in Hougang, he said.</p>
    <p>“Would that mean that the PAP should now also ex­pect and al­low the WP to do like­wise, in con­stituen­cies where the PAP are the in­cum­bents?” he added.</p>
    <p>“I should think not, lest a tit-for­tat cul­ture man­i­fests it­self, and cre</p>
    <p>Would that mean that the PAP should now also ex­pect and al­low the WP to do like­wise, in con­stituen­cies where the PAP are the in­cum­bents? I should think not... ates a di­vi­sive po­lit­i­cal cul­ture that only hurts Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that he hopes the PAP can start to ac­cept that even if par­ties dif­fer in their ideas, “we are in the end, one Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>His speech prompted Mr Murali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) to ask if Mr Tan would ac­cept that the ELD would deal with such com­plaints in an even-handed way. “And if he ac­cepts that, what’s the ba­sis of him sug­gest­ing that the PAP would use the power of in­cum­bency against op­po­nents in an un­fair way?”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Mr Tan said his party’s vol­un­teers rec­ti­fied the is­sues with the posters af­ter each com­plaint was made.</p>
    <p>He added that it would have been “un­think­able” for him to have WP flags planted around cof­fee shops in the then sin­gle seat of Feng­shan, where he con­tested in the 2015 GE and did not have sim­i­lar neg­a­tive ex</p>
    <p>And if he ac­cepts that, what’s the ba­sis of him sug­gest­ing that the PAP would use the power of in­cum­bency against op­po­nents in an un­fair way? pe­ri­ences with the PAP team there.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to his ex­pe­ri­ence in GE2020, he said: “If this is go­ing to be a prece­dent that is set by the PAP, per­haps the team in Hougang maybe, then re­ally, it raises the wider ques­tion of where do you draw the line with this kind of be­hav­iour?”</p>
    <p>He also added that the ELD was even-handed in han­dling the com­plaints dur­ing GE2020.</p>
    <p>Mr Murali said Mr Tan had not an­swered his other ques­tion on the ba­sis for sug­gest­ing the PAP uses its in­cum­bency against op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing, Mr Tan said: “I’m not sug­gest­ing the PAP is us­ing the power of its in­cum­bency to do those things. But I have raised var­i­ous in­ci­dents that have hap­pened as a re­sult of the ac­tions of cer­tain peo­ple. My point, re­ally, is that th­ese are all very petty and bad pol­i­tics, and we shouldn’t en­cour­age it.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night, ELD said it had re­ceived more than 220 com­plaints and pieces of feed­back from po­lit­i­cal par­ties, as well as mem­bers of the pub­lic, on elec­tion posters and ban­ners dur­ing the elec­tion. The breaches in­cluded posters and ban­ners be­ing within 50m of a polling station and be­low the 2.2m height re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>ELD’s ap­proach is to get the elec­tion agent to rec­tify the is­sue within three hours, tak­ing no fur­ther action if this is done. This was also the case for the com­plaints re­lat­ing to Mr Tan’s posters, it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s al­le­ga­tion that his posters were pulled down from their orig­i­nal height is a se­ri­ous one, ELD said, adding that it has not re­ceived any such re­port from the WP MP. “Mr Tan should file a re­port with ELD so that this can be in­ves­ti­gated,” it said.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier speech, Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten) also called for a “less con­fronta­tional po­lit­i­cal sys­tem” to unite Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The re­cent elec­tion showed that pol­i­tics has di­vided Sin­ga­pore, just as it has in other coun­tries, he said.</p>
    <p>“This is not good for us as a na­tion. The amount of vit­riol and hate which I read about dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign sad­dens me.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the elec­tion, he said, he re­ceived fre­quent feed­back that the Govern­ment is ar­ro­gant and un­will­ing to lis­ten, and that its lead­ers are out of touch and not hum­ble.</p>
    <p>“Rightly or wrongly, there is also the per­cep­tion that there is bul­ly­ing and un­fair treat­ment of peo­ple who do not agree with our poli­cies.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim urged the Govern­ment to be more open to con­struc­tive crit­i­cism and ra­tio­nal de­bate.</p>
    <p>“I would sub­mit that the Govern­ment must not treat politi­cians from other par­ties as en­e­mies... We must as­sume that they also want the best for Sin­ga­pore, even if they do not agree with all the govern­ment poli­cies.”</p>
    <p>The rul­ing party should ac­knowl­edge and con­sider good i deas raised by politi­cians from other par­ties, as well as PAP back­benchers, he added.</p>
    <p>At the same time, lead­ers of other op­po­si­tion par­ties should con­demn de­struc­tive crit­i­cisms which “push false­hood and twist facts out of con­text”, Mr Lim said.</p>
    <p>“Con­struc­tive sug­ges­tions build up Sin­ga­pore. De­struc­tive un­truths will bring down our coun­try be­cause they in­stil ha­tred against fair and de­cent lead­ers.”</p>
