    <p>LON­DON • More than 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple have lost their lives due to Covid-19, with one death re­ported ev­ery nine sec­onds on a weekly av­er­age, as vac­ci­na­tions are set to be­gin this month in a hand­ful of de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
    <p>Half a mil­lion deaths oc­curred in just the past two months, in­di­cat­ing that the sever­ity of the pan­demic is far from over.</p>
    <p>Nearly 65 mil­lion peo­ple glob­ally have been in­fected by the dis­ease and the worst af­fected coun­try, the United States, is cur­rently bat­tling a third wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In the past week alone, more than 10,000 peo­ple in the world</p>
    <p>died on av­er­age ev­ery sin­gle day, and the fig­ure has been ris­ing steadily each pass­ing week.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries across the world are now fight­ing sec­ond and third waves of in­fec­tion even greater than the first, forc­ing new re­stric­tions on ev­ery­day life.</p>
    <p>The US con­tin­ues to l ead in terms of fa­tal­i­ties with more than 276,000 deaths, and has more than 14 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>The coun­try set sin­gle-day records for new in­fec­tions and deaths on Thurs­day with 211,762 new cases and 2,858 deaths con­firmed, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally. Hospi­tal­i­sa­tions topped 100,000.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia’s gov­er­nor said he would im­pose some of the coun­try’s strictest stay-at-home or­ders in the com­ing days, when in­ten­sive care units are ex­pected to reach ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s cap­i­tal Seoul yes­ter­day an­nounced un­prece­dented re­stric­tions, shut­ter­ing most es­tab­lish­ments and shops at 9pm and cut­ting back on pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tions by 30 per cent in the evenings, as daily coro­n­avirus cases hit a nine-month high.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus caused more deaths in the past year than tu­ber­cu­lo­sis last year, and nearly four times the num­ber of deaths due to malaria, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Robert Red­field, the head of the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion, warned on Wed­nes­day that the pan­demic will pose the coun­try’s grimmest health cri­sis yet over the next few months, be­fore vac­cines be­come widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den said on Thurs­day that he will ask Amer­i­cans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>North Amer­ica and the Latin Amer­i­can re­gion com­bined have more than 50 per cent of all coro­n­avirus deaths that have been re­ported. The Latin Amer­i­can re­gion, the worst af­fected glob­ally in terms of fa­tal­i­ties, re­cently sur­passed 450,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Bri­tain be­came the first coun­try to ap­prove the vac­cine can­di­date de­vel­oped by Ger­many’s BioNTech and Pfizer, jump­ing ahead of the rest of the world in the race to be­gin a cru­cial mass inoc­u­la­tion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>But sup­plies are ex­pected to be very lim­ited in the early stages, which means that ev­ery coun­try be­gin­ning the drive will have to pri­ori­tise based on risk fac­tors.</p>
    <p>US health reg­u­la­tors are ex­pected to ap­prove dis­tri­bu­tion and ad­min­is­tra­tion of the vac­cine in mid-De­cem­ber.</p>
