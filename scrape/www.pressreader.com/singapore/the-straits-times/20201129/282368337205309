    <p>In Ni­cole Krauss’ new col­lec­tion To Be A Man, there is a story called Fu­ture Emer­gen­cies in which, due to a mys­te­ri­ous catas­tro­phe, gas masks are dis­trib­uted to the peo­ple of the United States.</p>
    <p>“For a long time, they said we didn’t need them,” says the nar­ra­tor, “but then some­thing changed and they said that we did.”</p>
    <p>She muses on where the threat will come from. “The threat may come from an un­known source,” the ra­dio replies.</p>
    <p>She thinks: “Even when the news is bad, I am glad to have been an­swered.”</p>
    <p>It might sound like Krauss, 46, pro­duced Fu­ture Emer­gen­cies for the present Covid-19 pan­demic, but it is in fact the old­est story in the col­lec­tion, writ­ten just after the Sept 11, 2001 at­tacks.</p>
    <p>“I think, in some sense, the anx­i­ety that be­gan with 9/11 has ex­tended over th­ese nearly 20 years,” says the Amer­i­can au­thor over Skype from her home in Brook­lyn.</p>
    <p>“It’s a long arc and it doesn’t seem to be less­en­ing.</p>
    <p>“I my­self can’t quite get over how strange it was to go back and read that story as I was putting the fi­nal touches on the col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>“When I was writ­ing that, it still seemed ab­surd to be walk­ing around with masks, to have one’s face cov­ered be­cause of the dan­ger of the world and what we might breathe in.”</p>
    <p>Krauss is the best-sell­ing au­thor of nov­els such as The His­tory Of Love (2005) and Great House (2010), and has been short­listed twice for the Orange Prize and once for the Na­tional Book Award.</p>
    <p>Her work of­ten ex­plores Jewish cul­ture and his­tory, though she is quick to clar­ify: “I’m not a Jewish writer, I’m a writer who hap­pens to be Jewish.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “There’s the paradox of both be­ing happy to be read and cel­e­brated by one’s peo­ple, but at the same time hav­ing an ab­so­lute re­fusal in the depths of one’s soul to be claimed by any­one.”</p>
    <p>To Be A Man is her first short fic­tion col­lec­tion. Its sto­ries man­age to be both in­ti­mate and faintly apoc­a­lyp­tic. In End Days, fires blaze through Cal­i­for­nia while a young de­liv­ery worker scram­bles to get her par­ents’ di­vorce pa­per­work to their rabbi.</p>
    <p>In Amour, the new­est story in the col­lec­tion, a man meets the woman he fan­cied decades ago in a refugee camp in a fu­ture Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Krauss wrote Amour in Jan­uary this year, after news broke that a US drone strike had killed Ira­nian ma­jor gen­eral Qasem Soleimani and many feared po­lit­i­cal re­tal­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It was the cul­mi­na­tion, she says, of four years’ worth of worry over the refugee cri­sis, cli­mate degra­da­tion and Mr Don­ald Trump’s pres­i­dency, though none of that makes it ex­plic­itly into the story.</p>
    <p>“All of those things are cook­ing in all of our minds, a low but steady boil in the back of our emo­tional lives,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to write a story about this re­la­tion­ship, the per­sonal that hap­pens in the shadow of enor­mous events.”</p>
    <p>Krauss has of­ten thought about what it would be like to be a man. “I grew up with a very strong sense of iden­ti­fy­ing with men, be­cause to iden­tify with women – given the mod­els I had avail­able to me as a young girl – would have been to iden­tify with forms of sub­ju­ga­tion or an in­abil­ity to ac­cess strength or in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never longed to be a man, but I longed for those free­doms and I found them in men, and I tried, as best as I could, to ab­sorb them into my be­ing. But I think, as I’ve got­ten older, I have be­gun to truly ap­pre­ci­ate the choice of what it is to be a woman.”</p>
    <p>The ti­tle story, To Be A Man, is about “a woman with an enor­mous amount of ex­pe­ri­ence with men” who has two sons.</p>
    <p>“It’s about what it is to raise boys with the knowl­edge of what it is to be a woman, and what it is to look at men in one’s life strug­gling with the idea of what it is to be a man.”</p>
    <p>Krauss her­self has two sons aged 14 and 11 with writer Jonathan Safran Foer, best known for his nov­els Ev­ery­thing Is Il­lu­mi­nated (2002) and Ex­tremely Loud And In­cred­i­bly Close (2005).</p>
    <p>Once among the power cou­ples of lit­er­ary Brook­lyn, they di­vorced in 2014 after 10 years of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>In 2017, she pub­lished her fourth novel, For­est Dark.</p>
    <p>It in­ter­twines the j our­neys of two nar­ra­tors in Tel Aviv – one a freshly di­vorced mil­lion­aire lawyer, 68; the other a nov­el­ist try­ing to es­cape a fail­ing mar­riage and writer’s block.</p>
    <p>The fact that the nov­el­ist is called Ni­cole drew many as­sump­tions that For­est Dark was au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal. Krauss con­sid­ers such read­ings “blink­ered”.</p>
    <p>She says: “All of my sto­ries, even the ones that seem far-flung from my life, are filled with per­sonal in­flu­ence and touched by in­ven­tion. Read­ers shouldn’t make the mis­take that the things we write are au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal.</p>
    <p>“They’re a mix of the deeply per­sonal and the imag­ined.”</p>
    <p>Asked if she is now sin­gle or in a re­la­tion­ship, she cryp­ti­cally quotes from the story To Be A Man, about the “no-man’s-land where one stood ut­terly un­de­fended, with noth­ing that one has promised and noth­ing that has been promised to one, but with a bright, clear view that goes on and on, all the way to the hori­zon”.</p>
    <p>With a wry laugh, she adds: “Suf­fice to say that the free­dom – the pu­rity of what it is to wake up every day and know that one can do any­thing, that any­thing can hap­pen to one, that all ex­pe­ri­ences are avail­able to one – is still not a feel­ing that I’m will­ing to re­lin­quish.”</p>
