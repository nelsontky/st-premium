    <p>A 52-year-old man was charged yes­ter­day with vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to an SBS Tran­sit bus driver af­ter he boarded the bus with­out wear­ing a mask.</p>
    <p>Ja’afally Ab­dul Rahim is ac­cused of caus­ing hurt to bus driver Low Kok Weng along Pasir Ris Drive 1 at about 2.50pm on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He is said to have pushed the driver in the face, caus­ing him to sus­tain red­ness there.</p>
    <p>He also faces one charge of pos­sess­ing a knife with a 6cm-long blade, which is an of­fen­sive weapon un­der the law, at that time.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Wed­nes­day, SBS Tran­sit said that a 52-year-old man had boarded ser­vice 21 along Pasir Ris Drive 6 at about 2.45pm the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>The man, who put on his mask only later, be­gan hurl­ing vul­gar­i­ties at the bus driver, who was not named in the Face­book post by SBS Tran­sit, and con­tin­ued to do so for the du­ra­tion of two bus stops.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the driver stopped the bus in front of Block 210 in Pasir Ris Drive 1 to wait for the po­lice to ar­rive, the com­muter al­legedly started phys­i­cally abus­ing him.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to SBS Tran­sit, three men at the bus stop boarded the bus and tack­led the man, drag­ging him out of the bus. They then pinned him down un­til the po­lice ar­rived.</p>
    <p>The bus driver was taken con­scious to Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal af­ter the as­sault and given three days of med­i­cal leave.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit noted that sev­eral of its bus cap­tains have been abused in the last few months for en­forc­ing the strict mask-up rule.</p>
    <p>Ja’afally has been granted bail of $15,000 and is ex­pected to be back in court on Oct 8.</p>
    <p>If found guilty of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt, Ja’afally can be jailed for up to three years and/or fined up to $5,000. Those con­victed of pos­sess­ing an of­fen­sive weapon can be jailed up to three years and face at least six strokes of the cane. Ja’afally can­not be caned as he is above 50.</p>
