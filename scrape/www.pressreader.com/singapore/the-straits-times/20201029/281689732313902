    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s top health of­fi­cial has ad­vised that elec­tions in the coun­try be put off as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is still at a se­vere stage.</p>
    <p>Health Min­istry di­rec­tor-gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah said Malaysia should learn from its ex­pe­ri­ence with the Sabah elec­tion, which be­came the start­ing point of the cur­rent coro­n­avirus wave in the state and the rest of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Even though there are SOPs (stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures), more im­por­tant is whether the peo­ple com­ply with the SOP.</p>
    <p>“We have learnt from Sabah. We hope not to re­peat the con­se­quences of hav­ing an elec­tion in other states,” said Dr Noor Hisham at the min­istry’s Covid-19 press con­fer­ence in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The Sarawak state elec­tion must be held be­fore Au­gust next year. There is plenty of spec­u­la­tion that the state gov­ern­ment might de­cide to call for polls soon.</p>
    <p>The Batu Sapi by-elec­tion in Sabah, which was trig­gered by the death of in­cum­bent MP Liew Vui Keong, is sched­uled to be held on Dec 5. Nom­i­na­tion Day has been set for Nov 23.</p>
    <p>Dr Noor Hisham said that while the Health Min­istry can rec­om­mend whether to hold elec­tions, it is up to the gov­ern­ment and the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion to de­cide.</p>
    <p>“Our rec­om­men­da­tion is not to have an elec­tion. But if it needs to be held, per­haps we need to look at dif­fer­ent means to or­gan­ise it.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps we can im­pose that there will be no cross­ing of district bor­ders, no or­gan­is­ing of large gath­er­ings and no houseto-house vis­its. We may also con­sider us­ing postal votes,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Malaysia re­ported 801 new coro­n­avirus cases, bring­ing the na­tion’s tally to 29,441 in­fec­tions. It also recorded eight new fa­tal­i­ties, tak­ing the death toll to 246.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia pres­i­dent Ab­dul Hadi Awang said the de­ci­sion on whether to en­force a state of emer­gency to curb Covid-19 should be made by health and safety ex­perts, in­stead of politi­cians and con­sti­tu­tional ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“The on­go­ing prob­lem must be re­ferred to the real ex­perts. Oth­er­wise, the de­ci­sion made would not be in tan­dem with re­al­ity,” said Datuk Seri Ab­dul Hadi, whose party is part of the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin had pro­posed im­pos­ing emer­gency mea­sures to curb the spread of the virus, but this was re­jected by the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics said that Tan Sri Muhyid­din was us­ing the pan­demic as an ex­cuse to stay in power.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Hadi said many front­line work­ers, in­clud­ing health of­fi­cers, the po­lice and mem­bers of the armed forces, have be­come vic­tims of Covid-19 while car­ry­ing out their du­ties.</p>
    <p>He added that at­ten­tion should be placed on the true ca­pac­ity of the po­lice and the armed forces in en­forc­ing move­ment re­stric­tions and bor­der con­trol mea­sures.</p>
