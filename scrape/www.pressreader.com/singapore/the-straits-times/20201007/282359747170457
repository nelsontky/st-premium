    <p>LeBron James on Mon­day said he is not let­ting the highs and lows of the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals get the bet­ter of him, pre­fer­ring to fo­cus on fix­ing the mis­takes that led his Los An­ge­les Lak­ers to fall 115-104 to the Mi­ami Heat on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers en­joy a 2-1 advantage in the best-of-seven se­ries but the team had an off-day in Game 3, com­mit­ting 20 turnovers and suf­fer­ing too many de­fen­sive break­downs against a short-handed Heat squad.</p>
    <p>A frus­trated James left the court with 10 sec­onds left in Sun­day’s game but the vet­eran for­ward vowed that the team will be bet­ter in Game 4.</p>
    <p>“We’re able to take a loss and un­der­stand why we lost. Un­der­stand things that we should have done bet­ter and things that we can ap­ply to the next game to be bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, no one wants to ever lose. You hate that feel­ing, es­pe­cially when you know you didn’t play your best, and I def­i­nitely wasn’t at my best last night from an in­di­vid­ual stand­point.</p>
    <p>“So I take that re­spon­si­bil­ity and I take that with a lot of pas­sion and un­der­stand­ing of how I can be much bet­ter i n the fol­low­ing game.”</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old is two wins away from his fourth cham­pi­onship and said his ex­pe­ri­ence has helped him ap­pre­ci­ate the im­por­tance of man­ag­ing his emo­tions.</p>
    <p>“Through­out the post­sea­son, I stay even keel,” he said.</p>
    <p>“As I’ve grown in this game and I’ve grown over the years, I kind of stay even keel, un­der­stand­ing that there’s al­ways an­other op­por­tu­nity to get bet­ter. We have that op­por­tu­nity to­day and also to­mor­row night in the game.”</p>
    <p>This year’s NBA Fi­nals will cap a sea­son un­like any other as play restarted in July af­ter a four-month hia­tus with all games held at Dis­ney World in Florida to limit the risk from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami play­ers Bam Ade­bayo and Go­ran Dragic on Mon­day said they were itch­ing to re­turn to ac­tion af­ter be­ing side­lined with in­juries as their team look to bat­tle back from the deficit.</p>
    <p>Ade­bayo suf­fered a neck strain and Dragic tore his left heel lig­a­ment in Game 1 and it is un­clear when they will be cleared to re­turn.</p>
    <p>“I’m get­ting bet­ter,” said Ade­bayo, who has av­er­aged 17.8 points and 10.9 re­bounds per game in the play-offs.</p>
    <p>“I’m try­ing to get back as quickly as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>He added that the med­i­cal staff are “try­ing to make sure I’m safe and I’m ready to play”.</p>
    <p>Dragic, who is av­er­ag­ing 19.9 points per game in the play-offs, said he was im­prov­ing but re­mained in a lot of pain.</p>
    <p>“I want to be out there with my team. That’s no se­cret. That’s what I was work­ing my whole ca­reer for 12 years in the NBA,” he said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter los­ing the first two games by dou­ble dig­its, the Heat won on Sun­day thanks in no small part to Jimmy But­ler’s 40-point triple dou­ble.</p>
    <p>“We’re not go­ing to lay down; we’re go­ing to fight back in this thing and even it up 2-2,” he said. REUTERS</p>
