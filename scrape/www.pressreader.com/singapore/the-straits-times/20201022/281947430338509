    <p>1</p>
    <p>AGE DIS­CRIM­I­NA­TION</p>
    <p>A se­cu­rity agency posted a va­cancy for a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer po­si­tion, call­ing only those un­der 50 years old to ap­ply. It had its work pass priv­i­leges sus­pended af­ter Tafep re­ceived a com­plaint from a prospec­tive can­di­date.</p>
    <p>The agency had claimed that the age re­quire­ment was due to safety rea­sons, as can­di­dates had to un­dergo a cer­ti­fi­ca­tion course for fire and haz­mat emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>As there were no le­gal age re­quire­ments for the job or the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, Tafep asked the agency to re­move the job ad, sign up for the Tri­par­tite Stan­dards work­shop on re­cruit­ment prac­tices, and post an apol­ogy. The com­pany com­plied. The case was re­ferred to MOM, which found that the agency did not have valid rea­sons for im­pos­ing the age re­quire­ment and sus­pended its work pass priv­i­leges for 12 months.</p>
    <p>2 NOT CON­SID­ER­ING SIN­GA­PORE­ANS FAIRLY</p>
    <p>A fi­nance and in­sur­ance firm pre-se­lected a for­eign can­di­date for a man­age­rial role at its Sin­ga­pore of­fice. A HR man­ager at the same firm filed a com­plaint with Tafep.</p>
    <p>Tafep found that while the firm posted a job ad on the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture por­tal for the min­i­mum pe­riod of 14 days stip­u­lated un­der the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work, the pre-se­lected ap­pli­cant had signed the employment con­tract be­fore the ad had ex­pired.</p>
    <p>The work ex­pe­ri­ence and ed­u­ca­tional qual­i­fi­ca­tions of the pre-se­lected ap­pli­cant also did not meet the ad­ver­tised re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The ad re­ceived over 60 ap­pli­ca­tions, with 28 ful­fill­ing the ad­ver­tised re­quire­ments, but none was in­vited for an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The case was re­ferred to MOM, which sus­pended the firm’s work pass priv­i­leges for six months.</p>
    <p>3 UN­FAIR RE­TRENCH­MENT PAY­OUTS</p>
    <p>A non-unionised in­sur­ance firm re­viewed its com­pen­sa­tion plans for re­trenched staff fol­low­ing Tafep’s in­ter­ven­tion, af­ter it was made known that the com­pany had capped the re­trench­ment pay­out at 12 years of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Tafep found that out of more than 40 laid-off em­ploy­ees, about 15 per cent would be af­fected by the cap, and ad­vised the com­pany on the im­por­tance of pro­vid­ing fair re­trench­ment ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­moved the 12-year cap and pro­vided a lower quan­tum be­yond 12 years of ser­vice with­out a cap.</p>
    <p>It also en­gaged an out­place­ment agency and worked with NTUC to find jobs for af­fected staff.</p>
