    <p>A teenager tres­passed into a dor­mi­tory at the National Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) eight times over the course of about six weeks as he wanted to take women’s un­der­gar­ments.</p>
    <p>Goh An Soon, now 20, who was not an NUS stu­dent at the time of the of­fences, pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to one count each of mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing the lin­gerie and tres­pass­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Tan Pei Wei said Goh would go to the dor­mi­tory at King Ed­ward VII Hall in Kent Ridge Road when­ever he felt an urge to look at the un­der­gar­ments. He did so be­tween Dec 19, 2018, and Feb 1 last year.</p>
    <p>He would check wash­ing ma­chines at the dor­mi­tory’s laun­dry ar­eas, or among the clothes hung to dry in the com­mon cor­ri­dor, for lin­gerie left unat­tended.</p>
    <p>The DPP added: “He claimed that he would then take the un­der­gar­ments to pantry rooms in neigh­bour­ing blocks of the cam­pus to look at them up close, and that he left the un­der­gar­ments be­hind in th­ese rooms there­after.”</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, he took more than just women’s un­der­wear. For in­stance, on Jan 16 last year, he took five laun­dry bags con­tain­ing items in­clud­ing a pair of socks, two towels and a pair of men’s un­der­wear.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing month, he took a wal­let con­tain­ing items such as bank cards and a thumb drive. Most of th­ese items were re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>At around 6pm on Feb 1 last year, an NUS hall staff mem­ber spot­ted Goh be­hav­ing sus­pi­ciously around the dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>Goh was con­fronted at a pantry and the em­ployee alerted a cam­pus se­cu­rity in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer. The se­cu­rity of­fi­cer called the po­lice at 7.12pm that day, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, District Judge May Me­se­nas called for a re­port to as­sess Goh’s suit­abil­ity for pro­ba­tion. He will be sentenced on Dec 21.</p>
    <p>For mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing items be­long­ing to oth­ers, an of­fender can be jailed for up to two years and fined.</p>
