    <p>•</p>
    <p>A re­count i n Wis­con­sin’s largest county de­manded by Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s elec­tion cam­paign ended on Fri­day with Demo­cratic Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den gain­ing votes.</p>
    <p>After the re­count in Mil­wau­kee county, Mr Bi­den had a net gain of 132 votes, out of nearly 460,000 cast. Over­all, Mr Bi­den gained 257 votes to Mr Trump’s 125.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s cam­paign had de­manded re­counts in two of Wis­con­sin’s most pop­u­lous and Demo­cratic-lean­ing coun­ties, after los­ing Wis­con­sin to Mr Bi­den by over 20,000 votes.</p>
    <p>The two re­counts will cost the Trump cam­paign US$3 mil­lion (S$4 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Dane county is ex­pected to fin­ish its re­count on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Over­all, Mr Bi­den won the Nov 3 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion with 306 Elec­toral Col­lege votes – many more than the 270 needed for vic­tory – to Mr Trump’s 232. Mr Bi­den also leads by more than six mil­lion in the pop­u­lar vote tally.</p>
    <p>After the re­count ended, Mil­wau­kee county clerk Ge­orge Chris­ten­son said: “The re­count demon­strates what we al­ready know: that elec­tions in Mil­wau­kee County are fair, trans­par­ent, ac­cu­rate and se­cure.”</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign is still ex­pected to mount a le­gal chal­lenge to the over­all re­sult in Wis­con­sin, but time is run­ning out. The state is due to cer­tify its pres­i­den­tial re­sult next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a fed­eral ap­peals court on Fri­day re­jected a re­quest by Mr Trump’s cam­paign to block</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den from be­ing de­clared the win­ner of Penn­syl­va­nia, deal­ing an­other sig­nif­i­cant set­back to the bid to over­turn elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>“Free, fair elec­tions are the lifeblood of our democ­racy. Charges of un­fair­ness are se­ri­ous. But call­ing an elec­tion un­fair does not make it so,” wrote Judge Stephanos Bibas on be­half of a three-judge panel.</p>
    <p>“Charges re­quire spe­cific al­le­ga­tions and then proof. We have nei­ther here,” wrote Judge Bibas, who was nom­i­nated by Mr Trump. The case could still be ap­pealed to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia cer­ti­fied Mr Bi­den, who won the state’s pop­u­lar vote, as its win­ner this week. Un­der Penn­syl­va­nia law, the can­di­date who wins the pop­u­lar vote in the state gets all of the state’s 20 elec­toral votes.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­fused to con­cede to his Demo­cratic ri­val and con­tin­ues to claim, with­out ev­i­dence, wide­spread voter fraud.</p>
    <p>But as his le­gal chal­lenges to the re­sults fail, he said on Thurs­day he will leave the White House if the Elec­toral Col­lege votes for Bi­den, the clos­est he has come to con­ced­ing the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Soon after Fri­day’s rul­ing, Mr Trump posted a video from News­max on Twit­ter about al­leged voter fraud in Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign filed the Penn­syl­va­nia case ear­lier this month, say­ing that county elec­tion of­fi­cials had treated mail-in bal­lots in­con­sis­tently and ask­ing US District Judge Matthew Brann to halt cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of the re­sults.</p>
