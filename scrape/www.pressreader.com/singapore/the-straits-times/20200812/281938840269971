    <p>En­try re­stric­tions at four pop­u­lar wet mar­kets will be eased from to­mor­row af­ter a no­tice­able re­duc­tion in week­day queues, the National En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The four mar­kets – Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket, Chong Pang Mar­ket at Block 104/105 Yishun Ring Road, the mar­ket at Block 20/21 Mar­sil­ing Lane and the one at Block 505 Jurong West Street 52 – have seen week­day crowds re­duced to the point where there are ei­ther no queues or very short ones over the past three months.</p>
    <p>NEA sent a cir­cu­lar to stall­hold­ers at these four mar­kets yes­ter­day to an­nounce that the rule, which al­lowed shop­pers to visit these mar­kets only on al­ter­nate days de­pend­ing on the last digit of their iden­tity card num­ber, would be lifted on week­days. The aim is to fur­ther re­duce crowd­ing on week­ends by al­low­ing peo­ple more time to shop dur­ing the week, it said.</p>
    <p>NEA said in a state­ment: “Safe dis­tanc­ing within the mar­ket will not be com­pro­mised as the ac­cess con­trol sys­tem, which caps the num­ber of pa­trons who can be in­side the mar­ket at any one time, will still be in place.</p>
    <p>“We urge mem­bers of the public to con­tinue to ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>The rule, in place since April 22, will con­tinue to ap­ply on week­ends. Other mea­sures such as the use of SafeEn­try for con­tact trac­ing pur­poses and the 1m dis­tance be­tween pa­trons will re­main.</p>
    <p>Chong Pang Mar­ket pro­vi­sion shop owner Ng Meng Seah was not sure whether eas­ing the rule would lead to a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in shop­pers on week­days as foot­fall is quite “un­pre­dictable”.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old does not have spe­cial plans to man­age po­ten­tial crowds as “there is only so much you can do to pre­pare”.</p>
    <p>“There is not much I can do due to space con­straints. I will wait for Thurs­day to see if there is a big change in the num­ber of pa­trons be­fore I re­act,” he said.</p>
    <p>The tighter reg­u­la­tions over the past few months have af­fected his earn­ings, but he is not cel­e­brat­ing just yet and wants to first see the im­pact of the rules be­ing eased.</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Chan Heng Lian, who fre­quents Chong Pang Mar­ket, said the eas­ing of week­day re­stric­tions makes the rules a lot less com­pli­cated.</p>
    <p>The for­mer elec­tron­ics fac­tory worker, who is in his 70s, said he is happy he can now visit the mar­ket when­ever he wants to on week­days, es­pe­cially as “it is really crowded on week­ends”.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ready been avoid­ing the week­ends so this is great news,” he said. “This makes things so much eas­ier for me.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has been pro­gres­sively eas­ing rules that were im­posed ear­lier in the year to curb the spread of Covid-19. Up to 50 peo­ple can now at­tend wed­dings, while some places of wor­ship can hold ser­vices for up to 100 peo­ple.</p>
