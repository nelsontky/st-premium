    <p>A LE­GAL FIRST</p>
    <p>While 2020 has been pep­pered with promi­nent and high-pro­file court cases – from mat­ters in­volv­ing Lee Suet Fern to Parti Liyani to Hin Leong – no list of con­tenders for the le­gal case of the year would be com­plete with­out the one in­volv­ing an al­leged Nige­rian drug traf­ficker who was freed by the Court of Ap­peal af­ter nine years be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>The five-judge court – in a 4-1 de­ci­sion in Oc­to­ber – re­versed its pre­vi­ous de­ci­sion in 2015 to con­vict Mr Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chuk­wudi, now 34, of a cap­i­tal drug of­fence, rul­ing that the past judg­ment was “demon­stra­bly wrong” and can no longer stand, af­ter new ev­i­dence sur­faced that he was suf­fer­ing from post-trau­matic stress symp­toms when he lied to nar­cotics of­fi­cers in 2011.</p>
    <p>“This was a case of many firsts, with many ups and downs. It was also the first time in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory where the Court of Ap­peal re­opened a con­cluded crim­i­nal ap</p>
    <p>peal to re-ex­am­ine the case and ren­dered an ac­quit­tal,” said lawyer Eu­gene Thuraising­am, who was the as­signed lead lawyer for the case un­der the Le­gal As­sis­tance Scheme for Cap­i­tal Of­fences.</p>
    <p>“Ilechukwu was ar­rested in 2011 on sus­pi­cion of traf­fick­ing drugs into Sin­ga­pore, and I was ap­pointed his coun­sel in 2013. Nat­u­rally, when we first ob­tained his ac­quit­tal be­fore the High Court in 2015, we were ec­static,” added Mr Thuraising­am.</p>
    <p>“This turned quickly to dis­ap­point­ment when the pros­e­cu­tion ap­pealed to the Court of Ap­peal, which over­turned the ac­quit­tal, con­victed Ilechukwu and sent the case back to the High Court for sen­tenc­ing. In the Court of Ap­peal’s view at that time, there were many lies in Ilechukwu’s con­tem­po­ra­ne­ous po­lice state­ments which were sug­ges­tive of his guilt rather than in­no­cence.”</p>
    <p>The de­fence team then sought med­i­cal ev­i­dence to es­tab­lish whether Ilechukwu would qual­ify for life im­pris­on­ment in­stead of</p>
    <p>death un­der the al­ter­na­tive sen­tenc­ing regime in Sec­tion 33B of the Mis­use of Drugs Act.</p>
    <p>It emerged that an In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health psy­chi­atric re­port pre­pared for sen­tenc­ing found that Ilechukwu had suf­fered from post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der (PTSD) as a re­sult of wit­ness­ing a bru­tal tribal mas­sacre dur­ing his child­hood, and sug­gested that this may pro­vide an in­no­cent ex­pla­na­tion for the lies in his po­lice state­ments.</p>
    <p>“This gave our client a prov­i­den­tial life­line. In the light of this new, po­ten­tially ex­on­er­a­tive med­i­cal ev­i­dence, we asked the Court of Ap­peal to re­con­sider and set aside its pre­vi­ous con­vic­tion of Ilechukwu,” said Mr Thuraising­am.</p>
    <p>The top court agreed in 2017 to re­open the case to pre­vent a po­ten­tial mis­car­riage of jus­tice and sent the mat­ter to the High Court to eval­u­ate the med­i­cal ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther gru­elling trial fol­lowed in the High Court, where four ex­pert psy­chi­a­trists gave ev­i­dence about Ilechukwu’s men­tal state.</p>
    <p>This con­cluded with the court’s find­ing that he suf­fered from PTSD symp­toms dur­ing the state­ment­tak­ing process, and that his lies to the au­thor­i­ties may have re­sulted from an over­es­ti­ma­tion of the threat to his life in be­ing ac­cused of a crime car­ry­ing the death penalty.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous con­vic­tion was then set aside.</p>
    <p>Ilechukwu left for Nige­ria late last month af­ter trav­el­ling is­sues due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions were sorted out.</p>
    <p>Mr Thuraising­am said: “When I first in­ter­viewed Ilechukwu in prison, he could barely speak any English. Af­ter his re­lease from prison, over a small cel­e­bra­tory meal be­fore his flight home to Nige­ria, I was amused to de­tect what sounded like a slight Singlish ac­cent when he spoke.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing fought along­side him through all the ups and downs, this case is one for the books and will al­ways have a spe­cial place in my heart.”</p>
    <p>This was a case of many firsts, with many ups and downs. It was also the first time in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory where the Court of Ap­peal re­opened a con­cluded crim­i­nal ap­peal to re-ex­am­ine the case and ren­dered an ac­quit­tal.</p>
