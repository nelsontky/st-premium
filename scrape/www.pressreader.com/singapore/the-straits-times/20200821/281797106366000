    <p>WASHINGTON • Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have tried tak­ing a po­lit­i­cal sledge­ham­mer to China over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, as­sert­ing that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party cov­ered up the ini­tial out­break and al­lowed the virus to spread around the globe.</p>
    <p>But within the United States gov­ern­ment, in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials have ar­rived at a more nu­anced and com­plex find­ing of what Chi­nese of­fi­cials did wrong in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Bei­jing were kept in the dark for weeks about the po­ten­tial dev­as­ta­tion of the virus by lo­cal of­fi­cials in cen­tral China, ac­cord­ing to Amer­i­can of­fi­cials fa­mil­iar with a new in­ter­nal re­port by US in­tel­li­gence agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The re­port con­cluded that of­fi­cials in the city of Wuhan and Hubei prov­ince, where the out­break be­gan late last year, tried to hide in­for­ma­tion from China’s cen­tral lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The find­ing is con­sis­tent with re­port­ing by news or­gan­i­sa­tions and as­sess­ments by China ex­perts of the coun­try’s opaque gov­er­nance sys­tem. Lo­cal of­fi­cials of­ten with­hold in­for­ma­tion from Bei­jing for fear of reprisal, say cur­rent and for­mer Amer­i­can of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The new as­sess­ment does not con­tra­dict the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s crit­i­cism of China, but adds per­spec­tive and con­text to ac­tions – and in­ac­tions – that cre­ated the global cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said in a July 4 speech at the White House that “China’s se­crecy, de­cep­tions and cover-up” en­abled the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo in­sisted the ad­min­is­tra­tion was “telling the truth ev­ery day” about “the Com­mu­nist cover-up of that virus”.</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Navarro, a White House trade ad­viser, said last Satur­day that the pan­demic was “per­pe­trated on Amer­ica” by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>The ac­cu­sa­tions dove­tail with ad­vice from Trump cam­paign strate­gists to look tough on China to try to shift the spot­light from the Pres­i­dent’s fail­ures on the pan­demic and the US econ­omy, and to pa­per over his con­stant praise of Mr Xi Jin­ping, China’s au­thor­i­tar­ian leader.</p>
    <p>But the broad po­lit­i­cal mes­sag­ing leaves an im­pres­sion that Mr Xi and other top of­fi­cials knew of the dan­gers of Covid-19 in the early days and went to great lengths to hide them.</p>
    <p>The re­port adds to a body of ev­i­dence that shows how the malfea­sance of lo­cal Chi­nese of­fi­cials ap­peared to be a de­ci­sive fac­tor in the spread of the virus within Wuhan and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The re­port, orig­i­nally cir­cu­lated in June, has clas­si­fied and un­clas­si­fied sec­tions, and it rep­re­sents the con­sen­sus of the Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency and other in­tel­li­gence agen­cies.</p>
    <p>It still sup­ports the over­all no­tion that Com­mu­nist Party of­fi­cials hid im­por­tant in­for­ma­tion from the world, US of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The re­port says se­nior of­fi­cials in Bei­jing, even as they were scram­bling to pry data from of­fi­cials in cen­tral China, played a role in ob­scur­ing the out­break by with­hold­ing in­for­ma­tion from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>But the re­port adds to a body of ev­i­dence that shows how the malfea­sance of lo­cal Chi­nese of­fi­cials ap­peared to be a de­ci­sive fac­tor in the spread of the virus within Wuhan and be­yond.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials com­mis­sioned the new in­tel­li­gence re­port after a Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity anal­y­sis said Chi­nese cen­tral gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials hid the sever­ity of the virus in early Jan­uary to hoard med­i­cal gear.</p>
    <p>That ear­lier re­port, an un­usual at­tempt by Home­land Se­cu­rity in­tel­li­gence an­a­lysts to ex­am­ine a for­eign power, re­lied heav­ily on pub­lic trade data, a se­nior law en­force­ment of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers asked the en­tire in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity to ex­am­ine it, and an­a­lysts came up with the new con­sen­sus re­port that aimed to re­fine and even cor­rect the Home­land Se­cu­rity as­sess­ment.</p>
    <p>The new re­port does not di­min­ish China’s cul­pa­bil­ity, said cur­rent and for­mer ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­nal US gov­ern­ment as­sess­ment of the dif­fer­ences in fault be­tween Chi­nese lead­ers and lo­cal of­fi­cials po­ten­tially has sig­nif­i­cant pol­icy im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“It makes a huge difference if it was Wuhan or Bei­jing,” said Dr Michael Pills­bury, a China scholar at Hud­son In­sti­tute who in­for­mally ad­vises Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Al­though Dr Pills­bury ad­vo­cates com­pet­ing with China, he also sup­ports diplo­macy and stick­ing to a trade agree­ment that Mr Xi and Mr Trump signed in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>If Mr Xi was not the main per­son at fault, he said, then that meant that top Chi­nese of­fi­cials had not en­gaged in to­tal de­ceit on the coro­n­avirus, and Amer­i­can of­fi­cials had some ba­sis for still try­ing to en­gage in good-faith ne­go­ti­a­tions with Bei­jing on is­sues of mu­tual in­ter­est.</p>
