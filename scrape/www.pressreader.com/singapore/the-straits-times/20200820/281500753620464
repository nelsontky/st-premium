    <p>A govern­ment smart­phone app that pro­vides ser­vices to users at var­i­ous stages of their lives has been up­graded to give them ac­cess to more than 40 govern­ment ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The LifeSG app, the up­graded and re­branded govern­ment ap­pli­ca­tion app which re­places the Mo­ments of Life (MOL) app, will come with im­proved user ex­pe­ri­ence, Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some of the new ser­vices in­clude Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) top­ups, re­new­ing sea­son park­ing, and ap­ply­ing for a pass­port, a home loan el­i­gi­bil­ity let­ter or a PAs­sion Card.</p>
    <p>The Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Govern­ment Of­fice (SNDGO) said the app will pro­vide all users with a one-stop per­son­alised ac­cess to govern­ment ser­vices.</p>
    <p>It is an ex­pan­sion of the MOL app, which cur­rently pro­vides 12 ser­vices and caters to young par­ents and the el­derly, mak­ing it pos­si­ble to reg­is­ter the birth of a child or ac­cess a per­son­alised in­for­ma­tion page that shows the ben­e­fits for which they qual­ify.</p>
    <p>The new ser­vices were cho­sen be­cause they are among the more fre­quently used, data from the Govern­ment showed. The SNDGO said that it will be adding more ser­vices pro­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>LifeSG will fea­ture a per­son­alised dash­board where users can dis­cover ser­vices or con­tent rel­e­vant to them, and ac­cess guides for job hunt­ing or search­ing for a pre-school.</p>
    <p>Sug­ges­tions on this dash­board will re­flect the in­ter­ests the user in­di­cated after in­stalling the app or up­dat­ing the app from MOL.</p>
    <p>SNDGO said the dash­board will be fur­ther im­proved in the fu­ture to pro­vide an over­view of key per­sonal in­for­ma­tion such as one’s CPF, hous­ing and ed­u­ca­tion de­tails.</p>
    <p>LifeSG will even­tu­ally re­mind users about up­com­ing med­i­cal and school ap­point­ments and prompt them to com­plete ap­pli­ca­tions for mat­ters such as birth reg­is­tra­tion, Baby Bonus and pri­mary school reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>GovTech chief ex­ec­u­tive Kok Ping Soon said: “We will con­tinue to ex­tend sim­pler ac­cess to dig­i­tal ser­vices and per­son­alised con­tent to more cit­i­zens, and eval­u­ate their needs and feed­back to im­prove the</p>
    <p>The new ser­vices were cho­sen be­cause they are among the more fre­quently used, data from the Govern­ment showed. The Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Govern­ment Of­fice said that it will be adding more ser­vices pro­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>app with more use­ful fea­tures.”</p>
    <p>Since its launch, MOL has been the one-stop app for par­ents to reg­is­ter the birth of their child and ap­ply for the Baby Bonus and child library mem­ber­ship. Ap­pli­ca­tion for these three ser­vices is done through just one form.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this, birth reg­is­tra­tion was pa­per-based and done at hos­pi­tals or the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity build­ing. Sep­a­rate forms were needed.</p>
    <p>MOL, which has been down­loaded more than 165,000 times, has man­aged to cut the time spent on such ap­pli­ca­tions from 60 to 15 min­utes, and has en­abled the reg­is­tra­tion of seven out of 10 new­borns here.</p>
    <p>A GovTech spokesman told The Straits Times that LifeSG and SingPass Mo­bile – the na­tional au­then­ti­ca­tion sys­tem that al­ready of­fers ac­cess to dig­i­tal ser­vices from more than 60 agen­cies – are meant to be com­ple­men­tary apps, which to­gether make it eas­ier for Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents to “trans­act dig­i­tally in a se­cure and con­ve­nient man­ner”.</p>
    <p>He said that while SingPass Mo­bile al­lows quick ac­cess to ser­vices for res­i­dents who know what they want to do, LifeSG pro­vides a per­son­alised ex­pe­ri­ence and helps users dis­cover rel­e­vant ser­vices and in­for­ma­tion that they might not even be aware of.</p>
    <p>With LifeSG, said the spokesman, “users are also of­fered rec­om­men­da­tions based on their user pro­files and top­ics that they have ex­pressed an in­ter­est in.”</p>
