    <p>A 17-year-old New Zealan­der, whose TikTok an­them Sav­age Love has been viewed more than a bil­lion times, said on Wed­nes­day “it blows my mind” to have now topped the United States Bill­board sin­gles chart.</p>
    <p>Jawsh 685 – whose real name is Joshua Nanai (right) – saw his vi­ral in­stru­men­tal remixed by US R&B star Ja­son Derulo and South Korean su­per­group BTS to be­come an in­ter­na­tional mega-hit.</p>
    <p>“It blows my mind to be US num­ber 1,” he said in a so­cial me­dia video post. “A kid from South Auck­land y’know show­ing other kids you can do it, any street you’re from, any­where. You can do it, be­lieve in your­self, you can do it. Trust me.” The young pro­ducer’s dream run of suc­cess be­gan after the tune – Sav­age Love (Laxed – Siren Beat) – was picked up by TikTok users as the back­ing track for a hugely pop­u­lar dance chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge – which saw users show­case their cul­tural her­itage by dress­ing in tra­di­tional out­fits and danc­ing to the song – was also em­braced by stars like singer Jen­nifer Lopez and talk-show host Jimmy Fal­lon.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, the hash­tags #siren­beat, #siren­beatchal­lenge and #laxed­siren­beat have col­lec­tively been viewed more than 2.4 bil­lion times on the video-based so­cial me­dia plat­form.</p>
    <p>Nanai was signed by Columbia Records and has now topped the charts in Bri­tain, Ger­many, New</p>
    <p>Zealand and Aus­tralia, among other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The song ini­tially caused some con­tro­versy after Derulo took the orig­i­nal beat, added some lyrics and pro­moted it as his own.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the con­tro­versy, Nanai told lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion Mai FM in June there had been an ex­change of mes­sages be­tween the two be­fore the in­ci­dent, but that it was “un­fin­ished busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>Columbia Records has since said Derulo and Nanai have “put aside their dif­fer­ences and come to­gether”.</p>
