    <p>Cus­tomers as well as own­ers of bars and pubs wel­comed the Gov­ern­ment’s pi­lot pro­gramme to re­open nightlife venues, but were re­al­is­tic that this is still not busi­ness as usual.</p>
    <p>Among the first cus­tomers at Bell Bar in Cup­page Plaza – one of the first three venues to re­open – was busi­ness­man Fu­jita Koichi, 57.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that he “may feel bored be­cause there’s no KTV or min­gling with the other cus­tomers”, he said he un­der­stood that this was for safety rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Ms Junko Mi­zouchi, founder of Bar Ki­haru at Or­chard Plaza, said she has had to fork out money for rent while there has been no in­flux of cus­tomers. The 12-year-old bar has been closed for eight months and is re­open­ing this week.</p>
    <p>“My reg­u­lar cus­tomers and neigh­bours have been en­cour­ag­ing me a lot... I feel blessed that I’m now able to re­open,” she said.</p>
    <p>On the pi­lot pro­gramme, she said there are “many strin­gent re­quire­ments to com­ply with for sure”.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be very tough and chal­leng­ing, but all these are for good,” she added.</p>
    <p>Dive bar Skinny’s Lounge at Boat Quay, which is open­ing to­day, de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Smaller bars and pubs with­out a food or snack bar li­cence have been among the last to re­open since the cir­cuit breaker to stem the spread of Covid-19 was lifted in June, and the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (SNBA) wel­comed the op­por­tu­nity for smaller play­ers to start up again.</p>
    <p>It said it re­ceived three pro­pos­als for 10 avail­able slots, and pro­posed two to the au­thor­i­ties – Bell Bar and Bar Ki­haru.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides their pro­posal for the en­try and safe man­age­ment mea­sures, we also stud­ied their CCTV (closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion) footage, floor plans and still images to see if they were com­ply­ing with things like safe dis­tanc­ing... There were also site inspection­s by SNBA and the rel­e­vant agen­cies,” as­so­ci­a­tion vice-pres­i­dent Nasen Thiagaraja­n told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“These three bars are too small to get a food or snack bar li­cence in, so this chance for them to re­open fi­nally is good.”</p>
    <p>Next, the SNBA is work­ing on sub­mis­sions for night­clubs and dis­cothe­ques, whose pi­lot pro­gramme is ex­pected to com­mence by next month. This will in­volve ad­di­tional and stricter mea­sures such as pre-en­try Covid-19 tests and a re­quire­ment to wear masks on the dance floor.</p>
    <p>Mr Thiagaraja­n said many night­clubs have al­ready looked at piv­ot­ing to a food and bev­er­age (F&B) busi­ness, as it is “more vi­able and you run less risk by run­ning the venue as an F&B es­tab­lish­ment”.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment an­nounced last month that nightlife es­tab­lish­ments that are not par­tic­i­pat­ing in the pi­lot pro­grammes can ap­ply for fi­nan­cial sup­port pack­ages to con­vert to F&B op­er­a­tions or other com­mer­cial uses. En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore of­fers a grant of up to $50,000.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral big play­ers like Zouk Sin­ga­pore in Clarke Quay, as well as Ce La Vi and Mar­quee Sin­ga­pore in Ma­rina Bay Sands, will not be par­tic­i­pat­ing in the pi­lot pro­gramme for night­clubs.</p>
    <p>One smaller venue – the night­club Nine­teen80 in Tan­jong Pa­gar Road run by A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive – has de­cided to pivot to be­ing a snack bar in­stead, and will be re­open­ing on Dec 18.</p>
    <p>A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive co­founder Francesca Way said feed­back from cus­tomers was that “many would not want to do the (Covid-19) test due to the costs and in­con­ve­nience”.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have a doubt that there will def­i­nitely be crowds who would still be will­ing to come, but the fi­nan­cial risks and un­cer­tainty for op­er­a­tors are high... From an op­er­a­tor’s per­spec­tive, the 10.30pm al­co­hol cut-off time is dif­fi­cult as nor­mally our peak, and thus lu­cra­tive, hours are from 11pm.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond the pi­lot pro­gramme, there’s a chance club­bing may not come back so soon, so at least this way we are able to pro­tect our team’s liveli­hoods and start on the road to re­cov­ery from the nine months we’ve been closed.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides their pro­posal for the en­try and safe man­age­ment mea­sures, we also stud­ied their CCTV footage, floor plans and still images to see if they were com­ply­ing with things like safe dis­tanc­ing... There were also site inspection­s by SNBA and the rel­e­vant agen­cies.</p>
