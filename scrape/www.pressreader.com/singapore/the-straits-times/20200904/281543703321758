    <p>PARIS • Ney­mar was one of three Paris Saint-Ger­main stars to have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus, a wellplaced source told Agence FrancePres­se on Wed­nes­day, af­ter the Cham­pi­ons League run­ners-up an­nounced sev­eral pos­i­tive tests.</p>
    <p>“Three Paris Saint-Ger­main play­ers have con­firmed pos­i­tive tests and are sub­ject to the ap­pro­pri­ate health pro­to­col,” PSG said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“All of the play­ers and coach­ing staff will con­tinue to un­dergo tests in the com­ing days.”</p>
    <p>When con­tacted by AFP, the club de­clined to con­firm the iden­tity of the play­ers in ques­tion.</p>
    <p>But when asked if Ney­mar was one of those to test pos­i­tive for Covid-19, along with team­mates An­gel di Maria and Le­an­dro Pare­des as was re­ported ear­lier in the week by French daily L’Equipe, the source replied “Yes.”</p>
    <p>The cases would ap­pear to be linked to a hol­i­day trip to the Span­ish party is­land of Ibiza that sev­eral PSG play­ers took fol­low­ing the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal de­feat by Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>The news is a set­back to the French tre­ble win­ners’ prepa­ra­tions for the sched­uled start of their Ligue One cam­paign next week, with a game away at Lens set for Sept 10 but pos­si­bly now at risk of be­ing post­poned.</p>
    <p>PSG had al­ready said on Mon­day that two un­named play­ers had re­ported back for pre-sea­son train­ing with coro­n­avirus symp­toms.</p>
    <p>L’Equipe re­ported the play­ers in ques­tion at the time were Ar­gentina in­ter­na­tion­als di Maria and</p>
    <p>Pare­des. Those two mid­field­ers, along with Ney­mar, An­der Her­rera, Mauro Icardi, Key­lor Navas and Mar­quin­hos all trav­elled to Ibiza fol­low­ing the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal, mix­ing with friends and fam­ily af­ter spend­ing the previous weeks iso­lated in a se­cure san­i­tary “bub­ble” with team­mates in Por­tu­gal for the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Ney­mar, who is said to be asymp­to­matic, later posted a pic­ture on In­sta­gram show­ing him and his son smil­ing, with the cap­tion: “Thank you for your mes­sages. We’re all fine!”</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian me­dia re­ports said the Sele­cao striker’s nine-year-old son and 55-year-old fa­ther, who also went to Ibiza, had tested pos­i­tive for the virus as well.</p>
    <p>The wife of com­pa­triot and de­fender Mar­quin­hos also re­vealed on In­sta­gram that her hus­band had been placed in isolation while await­ing the re­sults of his own test for Covid-19.</p>
