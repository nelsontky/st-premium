    <p>An in­surance scheme will be in­tro­duced next Jan­uary to cover mi­grant work­ers against non-workre­lated death, to­tal and per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity, as well as crit­i­cal ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>The scheme, un­der­writ­ten by In­come – the NTUC in­surance co­op­er­a­tive – will be avail­able from Jan 1 next year, and the pre­mium that em­ploy­ers need to pay is $9 a year for each worker.</p>
    <p>An­nounced yes­ter­day by the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and phil­an­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion Leap201, it is the first such in­surance scheme for mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Only mi­grant work­ers with a valid work per­mit or S Pass, and who are 60 years or younger, are el­i­gi­ble for it.</p>
    <p>Also, the first 50,000 work­ers who are signed up for the scheme will have their pre­mi­ums sub­sidised for the first two years. Their em­ploy­ers will pay just $3 an­nu­ally for each worker.</p>
    <p>This has been made pos­si­ble by the $600,000 raised so far by</p>
    <p>Leap201 and NTUC’s Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre (MWC).</p>
    <p>The pay­out from the in­surer is $10,000 if a worker dies from a non-work-re­lated ac­ci­dent or is to­tally and per­ma­nently dis­abled.</p>
    <p>Work­ers stricken with crit­i­cal ill­nesses will each re­ceive up to $10,000. The 37 crit­i­cal ill­nesses cov­ered un­der the scheme in­clude ma­jor can­cers, stroke with per­ma­nent neu­ro­log­i­cal deficit and heart at­tack of spec­i­fied sever­ity.</p>
    <p>“From MWC’s ex­pe­ri­ence, un­ex­pected heart at­tacks, can­cer, stroke and di­a­betes are some of the lead­ing causes of death among the mi­grant worker com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore,” said MWC chair­man Yeo Guat Kwang.</p>
    <p>In­come’s chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Yeo said: “When mi­grant work­ers are ren­dered un­able to work due to se­ri­ous in­juries, ill­nesses or worse, death, their loved ones at home are also very much im­pacted, as many mi­grant work­ers here are bread­win­ners of their fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>Leap201 chair­man Michael Lien urged em­ploy­ers and dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors to buy the in­surance. “It is up to us to care for the very peo­ple who help build our coun­try in their time of need,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try part­ners and em­ployer groups who wish to be early adopters of the scheme can e-mail MWC at feed­back@mwc.org.sg</p>
