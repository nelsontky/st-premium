    <p>KOTA KIN­A­BALU Sabah’s new Chief Min­is­ter, Datuk Seri Ha­jiji Noor, has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and is be­ing treated at Queen El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tal in the state cap­i­tal, Malaysia me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>The news could alarm se­nior politi­cians around the coun­try, as many of them cam­paigned closely with him for the Sept 26 state polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Ha­jiji’s pub­lic re­la­tions sec­re­tary, Mr Ef­fendi Mo­hamed Sunoh, told The Star on­line news that the</p>
    <p>Chief Min­is­ter’s con­di­tion was sta­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Ha­jiji, 65, is the sec­ond top of­fi­cial in Malaysia to have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, af­ter Min­is­ter for Re­li­gious Af­fairs Zulkifli Mo­hamad Al-Bakri. Like Mr Ha­jiji, Datuk Seri Zulkifli, 51, cam­paigned in the Sabah polls amid a surge in coro­n­avirus cases in the state.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, along with a dozen min­is­ters and deputy min­is­ters, are cur­rently in home quar­an­tine af­ter re­turn­ing from Sabah.</p>
    <p>An­gry Malaysians in Penin­su­lar Malaysia and Sarawak, tak­ing to so­cial me­dia and hang­ing ban­ners from bridges in Perak and Jo­hor, have blamed the politi­cians for bring­ing back the virus from Sabah into their states. This had led to a surge in cases from Kedah to Se­lan­gor to Tereng­ganu in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, sev­eral malls, of­fices, mosques and a golf re­sort around Malaysia have been shut down in the past few days for de­con­tam­i­na­tion work and con­tact tracing af­ter Covid-19 cases were de­tected.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have jumped into ac­tion amid a new surge in coro­n­avirus cases in the past week, with such cases hov­er­ing around 300 a day in the past seven days in­clud­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day re­ported 374 new cases to bring the cu­mu­la­tive to­tal to 15,096.</p>
