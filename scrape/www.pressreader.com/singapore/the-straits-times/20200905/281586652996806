    <p>Some 16,000 work­ers re­quired to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing for Covid-19 by to­day were yet to be sched­uled for it by their em­ploy­ers as of last night. Un­less they are tested by the dead­line, they will not be al­lowed to re­turn to work, the au­thor­i­ties said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Some 16,000 work­ers re­quired to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing for Covid-19 by to­day were yet to be sched­uled for it by their em­ploy­ers as of last night.</p>
    <p>Un­less they are tested by the dead­line, they will not be al­lowed to re­turn to work, the au­thor­i­ties said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The need for ros­tered rou­tine test­ing was first an­nounced on Aug 11 by the Min­istry of Man­power, the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and the Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB). The au­thor­i­ties said then that work­ers in high­er­risk set­tings would un­dergo a swab test ev­ery 14 days.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar test­ing is one of sev­eral mea­sures in­tro­duced to al­low the safe restart of work. Oth­ers in­clude im­ple­ment­ing safe liv­ing mea­sures in dorms and ar­rang­ing stag­gered pick-up and drop-off tim­ings to min­imise in­ter­ac­tion be­tween groups of work­ers.</p>
    <p>On Aug 18, the au­thor­i­ties an­nounced that they would stop work­ers from work­ing if their em­ploy­ers did not sched­ule them for test­ing, and urged em­ploy­ers to com­ply with the rules “to avoid dis­rup­tion to busi­ness op­er­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>On Aug 22, the dead­line of to­day for the first test was set. A fi­nal re­minder was is­sued to em­ploy­ers on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The ros­tered rou­tine test­ing re­quire­ment ap­plies to work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, as well as work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors and any work­ers who visit work sites.</p>
    <p>“Agen­cies have also stepped up ef­forts to di­rectly con­tact em­ploy­ers via calls and e-mails to prompt them to sched­ule their work­ers for ros­tered rou­tine test­ing be­fore the dead­line,” the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day. They added that “un­re­spon­sive em­ploy­ers who have per­sis­tently failed to sched­ule work­ers for ros­tered rou­tine test­ing may have their work pass priv­i­leges cur­tailed”.</p>
    <p>Most com­pa­nies The Straits Times spoke to said they had no is­sue sched­ul­ing their work­ers for rou­tine test­ing. But some also said they had to seek clarificat­ions when they could not find their work­ers in the reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem or found that the sys­tem in­cluded the names of work­ers who did not need to be on site.</p>
    <p>Ms Prenitha Thomas, an ad­min­is­tra­tive ex­ec­u­tive who had to reg­is­ter her com­pany’s for­eign work­ers, said she had been in con­stant con­tact with the dif­fer­ent agen­cies to iron out the de­tails since early last month. “We have to be very alert to what is hap­pen­ing, it is al­most like we have to be awake 24/7 and check,” she added.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers yet to sched­ule their work­ers for test­ing may do so on HPB’s swab reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem at swab.hpb.gov.sg</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers are also re­minded to log in to the sys­tem reg­u­larly to check if there are new work­ers for whom they need to sched­ule ap­point­ments, the agen­cies said in their state­ment.</p>
