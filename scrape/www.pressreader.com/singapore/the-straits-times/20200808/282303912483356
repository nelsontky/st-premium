    <p>• China’s econ­omy looked to have gath­ered pace in July as ex­ports rose the most this year while some raw ma­te­rial im­ports hit record highs, adding to hopes for a more sus­tained re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is grad­u­ally emerg­ing from a record con­trac­tion in the first quar­ter but the re­cov­ery is frag­ile as ris­ing coro­n­avirus cases around the world and re­newed lock­downs could hit de­mand. Chi­nese con­sumer spend­ing was sub­dued amid job losses and con­cerns about a resur­gence in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s ex­port per­for­mance, how­ever, has not been as se­verely af­fected by the global slow­down as some an­a­lysts had feared, while signs of sta­bil­i­sa­tion in the do­mes­tic econ­omy have re­duced the ur­gency for more stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>Ex­ports in July rose 7.2 per cent from a year ear­lier, the fastest pace since De­cem­ber last year, Cus­toms data showed yes­ter­day, con­found­ing an­a­lysts’ ex­pec­ta­tions for a 0.2 per cent drop and quick­en­ing from a 0.5 per cent in­crease in June.</p>
    <p>How­ever, im­ports fell 1.4 per cent, miss­ing mar­ket ex­pec­ta­tions for a 1.0 per cent in­crease.</p>
    <p>“The data is in line with our forecast for ex­ports to re­cover more de­ci­sively in H2 along­side the global econ­omy,” Mr Tommy Wu, lead econ­o­mist at Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics, said in a note, adding that ex­ter­nal de­mand for other prod­ucts, be­sides med­i­cal sup­plies, will re­cover grad­u­ally as global in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion starts pick­ing up.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the road ahead may be bumpy as new ex­port or­ders re­main weak and the re­cov­ery path will be un­even across economies.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts at­trib­uted the year-onyear dip in July im­ports to weaker com­mod­ity prices and pay­back fol­low­ing strong ship­ments in the pre­vi­ous year. They are op­ti­mistic that a ramp-up in in­fra­struc­ture projects on the back of pol­icy sup­port will lift im­port growth.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s trade sur­plus for</p>
    <p>July stood at US$62.3 bil­lion (S$85.4 bil­lion), up from a sur­plus of US$46.4 bil­lion in June.</p>
    <p>A risk for China’s trade out­look this year is height­en­ing US-China ten­sions which are ex­pected to es­ca­late ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. The coun­try’s trade sur­plus with the United States widened to US$32.5 bil­lion in July from US$29.4 bil­lion in June.</p>
    <p>China’s im­ports from the US in July rose 3.6 per cent from a year ear­lier, slow­ing from a 11.3 per cent gain in June. In Jan­uary-July, im­ports fell 3.5 per cent, fall­ing short of the com­mit­ments made in the Phase 1 trade deal to in­crease pur­chases of Amer­i­can goods.</p>
    <p>Se­nior US and Chi­nese of­fi­cials are set to re­view the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Phase 1 trade deal and likely air mu­tual griev­ances dur­ing a video con­fer­ence on Aug 15.</p>

But an&#xAD;a&#xAD;lysts cau&#xAD;tioned that the road ahead may still be bumpy.</p>
