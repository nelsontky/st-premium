    <p>The Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport’s (CAS) de­ci­sion to over­turn Manch­ester City’s two-year ban from Euro­pean foot­ball was “not a good day for foot­ball”, said Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp in a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Stat­ing his sup­port for Uefa’s Fi­nan­cial Fair Play (FFP), Klopp said: “FFP is a good idea. It is there for pro­tect­ing teams and the com­pe­ti­tion, so that no­body over­spends and have to make sure the money they want to spend is based on the right sources.”</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, Europe’s gov­ern­ing foot­ball body Uefa banned City from the Cham­pi­ons League for the next two sea­sons af­ter they were said to have falsely in­flated their spon­sor­ship rev­enues to avoid fall­ing foul of FFP reg­u­la­tions from 2012 to 2016.</p>
    <p>But the CAS on Mon­day over­turned the ban, re­duc­ing City’s fine from €30 mil­lion (S$47.6 mil­lion) to €10 mil­lion and find­ing the al­leged breaches “not es­tab­lished”.</p>
    <p>FFP was in­tro­duced by for­mer Uefa pres­i­dent Michel Pla­tini in 2009 to pre­vent clubs from spend­ing be­yond their means. Fol­low­ing CAS’ de­ci­sion, Uefa said that FFP is likely to un­dergo changes, but did not pro­vide more de­tails.</p>
    <p>Klopp wants it to stay, say­ing: “If the rich­est peo­ple or coun­tries can do what they want to, that would make it re­ally dif­fi­cult. That would lead to a world su­per league with 10 clubs.”</p>
    <p>City’s bid for the Euro­pean ti­tle would at least ben­e­fit Liver­pool as they try to re­tain their Premier League ti­tle, sug­gested Klopp.</p>
    <p>“They won’t have 10 or 12 games less now – no other team would have had a chance in the (Premier) league,” he said.</p>
    <p>The charis­matic man­ager, who led the Reds to their first league ti­tle in three decades, also hailed striker Mo­hamed Salah for his con­tri­bu­tions, call­ing his sign­ing in 2017, “a good day for Liver­pool”.</p>
    <p>The Egyp­tian has formed a for­mi­da­ble part­ner­ship with Sa­dio Mane and Roberto Firmino as the trio amassed 250 goals un­der Klopp.</p>
    <p>But the 53-year-old re­mained coy about the fu­ture of Croat De­jan Lovren, who has been linked with a move away from An­field, say­ing that the cen­tre-back is “al­ways an im­por­tant part of the squad”.</p>
    <p>He also ex­pressed re­gret at Liver­pool not be­ing able to tour in­ter­na­tion­ally in this year’s pre-sea­son ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic. The newly crowned cham­pi­ons were ini­tially sched­uled to fly to Sin­ga­pore this month for the In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup, but the tour­na­ment has been can­celled.</p>
    <p>“Now we can­not go any­where, we re­alise how nice it would be that we can start do­ing this again, the tours and all of this be­cause it’s im­por­tant for the club, it’s im­por­tant for the fan base and it’s ex­cit­ing as well,” said Klopp.</p>
    <p>As the Reds ready for their ti­tle de­fence against the likes of City, Manch­ester United and Chelsea, Klopp has also added Arse­nal to the mix, back­ing man­ager Mikel Arteta to lead them in the top-four bat­tle.</p>
    <p>Ahead of Liver­pool’s clash with Arse­nal to­day, Klopp said: “Arse­nal are an ex­cit­ing squad. They have of­fen­sive play­ers with mas­sive qual­ity and they’re com­ing up with re­ally good ones and it looks like Arse­nal will be chal­lengers again.”</p>
