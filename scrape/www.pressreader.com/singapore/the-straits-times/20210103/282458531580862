    <p>A name like Bond­ing Kitchen tells you noth­ing about the kind of cui­sine the eatery serves. So, it is just as well that the enig­mat­i­cally named restau­rant at Or­chard Gate­way has the words “Mod­ern Per­anakan Cui­sine” em­bla­zoned promi­nently on a wall near its en­trance.</p>
    <p>The Bond­ing Kitchen moniker is car­ried over from chef-owner Danny Chew’s pre­vi­ous pri­vate din­ing gig in Johor Baru be­fore he opened his first restau­rant in Sin­ga­pore last Oc­to­ber. The Malaysian sees him­self pro­vid­ing a place for peo­ple to bond over a meal with friends and fam­ily, or even over a cor­po­rate lunch or din­ner.</p>
    <p>So, he de­signed his Kueh Pie Tee ($12 for four) to be a do-it-your­self starter, in which din­ers join in fill­ing frit­ter cups in the shape of tiny top hats with stewed shred­ded veg­eta­bles, prawns, quail eggs and crispy lard bits, be­fore top­ping them with chilli sauce and sprigs of mi­cro-green.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant also in­cludes an in­ner semi-pri­vate area with a din­ing ta­ble and an is­land kitchen where guests can watch and in­ter­act with the chef as he pre­pares their meal.</p>
    <p>While Chew gets cre­ative with orig­i­nal dishes like Raw Scal­lop With Nasi Ulam & Hei Bi Hiam ($16), his menu is made up of mostly tra­di­tional Nonya dishes.</p>
    <p>But the recipes are his own and, per­haps be­cause of his Malaysian back­ground, quite dif­fer­ent from those of many Per­anakan restau­rants here.</p>
    <p>The dishes are less sweet, but also not very fiery. The flavours are bold nonethe­less, their char­ac­ters de­fined by a mas­ter­ful blend­ing of aro­matic spices and sea­son­ings.</p>
