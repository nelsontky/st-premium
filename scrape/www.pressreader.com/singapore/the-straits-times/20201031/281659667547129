    <p>Depart­ment store Robin­sons said it is do­ing its best to trans­fer staff to other brands un­der its par­ent com­pany, af­ter an­nounc­ing yes­ter­day that it will be clos­ing its last two stores in The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer em­ploys 175 staff here. “Any staff move­ment will de­pend on the cir­cum­stances,” it told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The Dubai-based Al-Fut­taim Group owns Robin­sons as well as fran­chises in­clud­ing Marks & Spencer and Zara.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons said yes­ter­day that it is liq­ui­dat­ing the two stores in Sin­ga­pore, as well as two stores in Malaysia. The Malaysian stores em­ploy 125 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“All store oper­a­tions staff un­der Robin­sons Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia will re­main in the em­ploy­ment of Robin­sons un­til fur­ther no­tice,” the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees were in­formed yes­ter­day of the stores’ liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons said liq­uida­tor Korda</p>
    <p>Men­tha will work to max­imise re­turns to cred­i­tors, in­clud­ing em­ploy­ees. It added that man­age­ment has en­sured that em­ploy­ees are sup­ported with pay­ments in keep­ing with the In­sol­vency, Re­struc­tur­ing and Dis­so­lu­tion Act. Th­ese will be made to work­ers in the next pay­ment cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“(This) is well in ad­vance of the usual liq­ui­da­tion process tim­ing, which would usu­ally take months,” the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>The pay­ments will be on top of em­ploy­ees’ salaries, which will be paid in full, in line with the num­ber of hours worked.</p>
    <p>Kor­daMen­tha will work with the Sin­ga­pore Man­ual and Mer­can­tile Work­ers’ Union (SMMWU) and rel­e­vant union bod­ies to sup­port em­ploy­ees. It will also tap ex­ist­ing govern­ment schemes such as the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age.</p>
    <p>SMMWU sec­re­tary-gen­eral David Yeo said the union was in­formed of Robin­sons’ plans to close ahead of time and will work with the Na­tional Trades Union Congress to help af­fected work­ers with train­ing and job match­ing. “We are also in touch with other unionised com­pa­nies to place af­fected work­ers in other jobs.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees past and present lamented the im­pend­ing clo­sures. For­mer Robin­sons em­ployee Donna Chua, who headed the store’s mar­ket­ing depart­ment for 19 years, said: “I have known many won­der­ful peo­ple in my team, staff from the store and sup­pli­ers. Robin­sons is a house­hold name that is iconic in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Robin­sons staff and brand pro­mot­ers whom ST spoke to did not know when the stores will shut­ter.</p>
    <p>A re­tail as­sis­tant, who has been with Robin­sons for over 10 years, teared up as she said: “We are all like fam­ily here, like broth­ers and sis­ters. We usu­ally pack meals and eat lunch to­gether in the pantry. Ev­ery­one is very sad­dened by the news.”</p>
