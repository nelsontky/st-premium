    <p>Twelve lantern dec­o­ra­tions bear­ing in­ap­pro­pri­ate Chi­nese greet­ings will be re­placed by to­mor­row, after they were mis­tak­enly pro­duced and put up in Chi­na­town last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The ban­ner-like lanterns, which were hung up along South Bridge Road ahead of the tra­di­tional street light-up cer­e­mony to mark the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val, had drawn com­ments from mem­bers of the pub­lic that they did not suit the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, one lantern’s mes­sage trans­lated into “bright and ma­jes­tic”, while an­other said “joy for the na­tion” – both phrases are not com­monly used to cel­e­brate the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val, which is a time for fam­ily re­unions.</p>
    <p>Ms Jen­nifer Lee, head of the Chi­na­town Fes­ti­val Street Light-up Sub-Com­mit­tee, said the com­mit­tee had flagged the prob­lem­atic greet­ings on some lanterns to its con­trac­tor, fol­low­ing in­ter­nal feed­back, and had asked for them to be re­moved be­fore pro­duc­tion be­gan.</p>
    <p>But they re­alised the changes were not made when the lights</p>
    <p>were be­ing tested last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“These changes were not made in time,” said Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>After the ban­ner-like lanterns</p>
    <p>were strung up, Face­book user Teoh Chee Boon com­mented that the dec­o­ra­tions were an ero­sion of Chi­nese cul­ture and opened Singa</p>
    <p>pore’s Chi­nese stan­dards to crit­i­cism. He said the choice of some vo­cab­u­lary was wrong and that one greet­ing was in­co­her­ent.</p>
    <p>An­other Face­book user pointed out that a phrase that trans­lated into “the bright moon twin­kles” did not make sense.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee said some of the greet­ings – like one that read “the stars shine” – might seem un­con­ven­tional, but were “to recre­ate the fa­mous retro Hong Kong am­bi­ence” which fea­tures neon signs.</p>
    <p>Among the lanterns be­ing re­placed is one that reads “joy for the na­tion”.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee did not dis­close the other de­signs be­ing re­placed but said it is work­ing with the con­trac­tor to re­place the af­fected lanterns.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee added that the Hong Kong-style dec­o­ra­tions are unique to South Bridge Road for this year’s light-up, while more tra­di­tional dec­o­ra­tions such as lo­tus flower lanterns and an­i­mal lanterns will be found along Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road.</p>
    <p>This year’s light-up will be livestream­ed on Thurs­day and will be up till Oct 16. It com­prises about 700 lanterns and sculp­tures which de­pict tra­di­tional fes­ti­val mo­tifs and char­ac­ters such as Chang’e, the god­dess of the moon in Chi­nese mythol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The Chi­na­town Fes­ti­val is or­gan­ised by Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng Cit­i­zens’ Con­sul­ta­tive Com­mit­tee and is made up of grass­roots vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time the lightup has sparked con­tro­versy. Last year, or­gan­is­ers had to re­paint a two-storey lantern of Chang’e fol­low­ing com­plaints that its fa­cial fea­tures looked too mas­cu­line.</p>
