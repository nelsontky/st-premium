    <p>Less rain is ex­pected in Sin­ga­pore for the rest of this month, but wet­ter weather could be ex­pected in the months ahead. The weath­er­man has de­clared the on­set of La Nina-like con­di­tions in the re­gion this month, af­ter be­ing on watch since July for the cli­mate phe­nom­e­non that brings rainier weather to South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Less rain is ex­pected to fall on Sin­ga­pore for the rest of this month, but wet­ter weather is ex­pected in the months ahead.</p>
    <p>The weath­er­man has de­clared the on­set of La Nina-like con­di­tions in the re­gion this month, af­ter be­ing on watch since July for the cli­mate phe­nom­e­non that brings rainier weather to South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>La Nina is the “cry­baby” sis­ter to El Nino – the phe­nom­e­non usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with hot and dry weather in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“La Nina-like con­di­tions have been de­tected in the west Pa­cific. Th­ese in­clude char­ac­ter­is­tic changes in the sea sur­face tem­per­a­ture, cloudi­ness and winds in the trop­i­cal Pa­cific Ocean,” the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS) of the National En­vi­ron­ment Agency told The Straits Times in re­sponse to queries last week.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows a Sept 14 up­date by the United States’ National Oceanic and At­mo­spheric Ad­min­is­tra­tion, which also con­cluded that La Nina con­di­tions are present.</p>
    <p>But the MSS spokesman noted that as La Nina events typ­i­cally oc­cur over sev­eral months, more ob­ser­va­tions are needed be­fore a La Nina event can be de­clared.</p>
    <p>La Nina and El Nino are op­po­site phases of a cli­mate phe­nom­e­non known as the El Nino South­ern Os­cil­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Both phe­nom­ena are caused by changes in at­mo­spheric pres­sure and sea sur­face tem­per­a­tures in the trop­i­cal Pa­cific Ocean, and have op­po­site ef­fects on the weather over the mar­itime con­ti­nent, which in­cludes Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal con­di­tions, the western Pa­cific – where coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia sit – is much warmer than the east.</p>
    <p>The rea­son lies in the way the winds blow. In the trop­i­cal Pa­cific Ocean, winds mainly blow from east to west. Th­ese pre­dictable trade winds, as they are known, keep warm wa­ter con­fined around the mar­itime con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>But dur­ing an El Nino, the trade winds weaken. This means the pool of warm wa­ter is no longer con­fined to the re­gion.</p>
    <p>As the warm wa­ter moves to­wards the cen­tral Pa­cific Ocean, the rain clouds fol­low.</p>
    <p>This is why dur­ing an El Nino event, South-east Asia ex­pe­ri­ences less rain, and hot­ter weather.</p>
    <p>But dur­ing a La Nina event, the op­po­site hap­pens.</p>
    <p>The trade winds in­ten­sify, caus­ing warm wa­ter to be more tightly con­fined around the mar­itime con­ti­nent. This con­cen­trates the mois­ture sup­ply which fu­els the for­ma­tion of rain clouds that bring more rain.</p>
    <p>But weather sci­en­tist Koh Tieh Yong from the Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sci­ences noted that the rain­fall ex­pe­ri­enced in the first half of this month is not likely to have been in­flu­enced by La Nina.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the in­creased rain­fall is likely due to the ob­served stronger winds blow­ing from the trop­i­cal In­dian Ocean, which caused more rain clouds to form over South-east Asia, bring­ing more rain, he added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Koh noted that as a La Nina event is still some way from fruition, its in­flu­ence on Septem­ber weather here is weak.</p>
    <p>This means that for this month, other fac­tors – such as at­mo­spheric os­cil­la­tions in the In­dian Ocean – could have a stronger in­flu­ence on weather here.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore sits be­tween the In­dian Ocean, lo­cated west of the coun­try, and the Pa­cific Ocean, to its east.</p>
    <p>“Watch out for La Nina’s po­ten­tial oc­cur­rence in the Pa­cific and the as­so­ci­ated wet­ter re­gional weather in next two months (Oc­to­ber-Novem­ber) in­stead,” he added.</p>
