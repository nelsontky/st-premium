    <p>A rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem, with the United Na­tions at its core, is the world’s best hope to build a sta­ble en­vi­ron­ment that can re­spond ef­fec­tively to global chal­lenges, Sin­ga­pore Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has said.</p>
    <p>“For all its lim­i­ta­tions, it has helped to level the play­ing field for all coun­tries,” PM Lee said of the UN in a video record­ing for the High-Level Meet­ing to com­mem­o­rate its 75th an­niver­sary yes­ter­day (this morn­ing, Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>In his re­marks, PM Lee called on mem­bers to work to­gether to up­date and re­form mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions like the UN so that they can re­main open, in­clu­sive, and able to re­spond ef­fec­tively to shared chal­lenges – in­clud­ing pan­demics and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>The UN has given small states like Sin­ga­pore a voice and a stake in the global com­mons, he said.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor pow­ers also ben­e­fit from a more peace­ful and sta­ble global en­vi­ron­ment, and when they take joint ini­tia­tives through mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions, it en­hances their po­lit­i­cal le­git­i­macy and moral author­ity, he added.</p>
    <p>As the UN com­mem­o­rates a mile­stone year, its meet­ings, in­clud­ing the up­com­ing Gen­eral Assembly, are al­most com­pletely vir­tual. The pan­demic and quar­an­tine re­stric­tions have made it im­prac­ti­cal or im­pos­si­ble for most world lead­ers to travel to New York City this month.</p>
    <p>But up to 170 world lead­ers were expected to de­liver video ad­dresses for the an­niver­sary meet­ing, which has as its theme “The fu­ture we want, the United Na­tions we need”, with a strong fo­cus on the role of youth and en­sur­ing the UN – which has 193 mem­ber states – re­mains rel­e­vant for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In his mes­sage, PM Lee high­lighted that Covid-19 is a re­minder of how in­ter­con­nected and in­ter­de­pen­dent coun­tries are, and the need for in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion to over­come the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The world was chang­ing even be­fore Covid-19,” he said. “Geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions were grow­ing; glob­al­i­sa­tion was show­ing fis­sures; iso­la­tion­ism, pro­tec­tion­ism and uni­lat­er­al­ism were push­ing back against mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion. The Covid-19 cri­sis has sharp­ened these trends, but it has also re­minded us how in­ter­con­nected and in­ter­de­pen­dent coun­tries are, and why we all need to work to­gether to de­feat the gravest chal­lenge of our time.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee ac­knowl­edged that re­cent trends have ex­posed mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions’ short­com­ings – the in­abil­ity to achieve con­sen­sus on ma­jor is­sues, the con­flicts that con­tinue to rav­age so­ci­eties, and the mil­lions who still lack ac­cess to food, health­care and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“We must work to­gether to up­date and re­form our mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions – in­clud­ing the UN – to keep the in­sti­tu­tions open, in­clu­sive, and fit for pur­pose, to re­flect cur­rent eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal re­al­i­ties, and to re­spond ef­fec­tively to shared chal­lenges of our time, in­clud­ing pan­demics, cli­mate change, ex­trem­ist ter­ror­ism, sus­tain­able devel­op­ment and cy­ber se­cu­rity,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee had ad­dressed the UN in per­son at the Gen­eral Assembly last year, when he said that a rules­based sys­tem im­poses re­spon­si­bil­i­ties on all coun­tries and cre­ates a sta­ble en­vi­ron­ment for all.</p>
    <p>In his mes­sage this year, he noted that mem­ber states ex­pect a lot from the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is only right that we give the UN com­men­su­rate lat­i­tude, re­sources and man­date to ful­fil its de­mand­ing mis­sion,” he urged.</p>
    <p>He noted that when Sin­ga­pore was ad­mit­ted to the UN in 1965, its first foreign min­is­ter S. Ra­jarat­nam said: “De­spite the cyn­ics who fo­cus at­ten­tion on its many short­com­ings, my coun­try has faith in the fu­ture of the United Na­tions, sim­ply be­cause with­out it there is no worth­while fu­ture for hu­man­ity.”</p>
    <p>That state­ment holds true to­day, PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is com­mit­ted to the fu­ture of the UN, and the val­ues and ideals of the UN Char­ter,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We are equally de­ter­mined to work with all coun­tries, in­clud­ing through the Fo­rum of Small States which we helped to es­tab­lish, to strengthen the UN.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore founded the fo­rum in 1992 as an in­for­mal group­ing for na­tions with pop­u­la­tions un­der 10 mil­lion to dis­cuss is­sues of com­mon in­ter­est. It now has 108 mem­bers.</p>
