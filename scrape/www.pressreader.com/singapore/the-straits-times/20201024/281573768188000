    <p>Sin­ga­pore has placed se­cond in an in­ter­na­tional study that ex­am­ined the cy­ber-se­cu­rity lit­er­acy of the pop­u­la­tion in 49 coun­tries and the Euro­pean Union. Switzer­land came out tops, and Bri­tain fol­lowed the Repub­lic. Sin­ga­pore was lauded in par­tic­u­lar for in­te­grat­ing cy­ber se­cu­rity thor­oughly into its for­mal ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem. It came out tops in this cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has placed se­cond in an in­ter­na­tional study that ex­am­ined the cy­ber-se­cu­rity lit­er­acy of the pop­u­la­tion in 49 coun­tries and the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land came out top and Bri­tain fol­lowed the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>The Cy­ber Risk Lit­er­acy and Ed­u­ca­tion Index, pub­lished by man­age­ment con­sul­tancy Oliver Wy­man this month, looked at how coun­tries han­dled cy­ber se­cu­rity across five cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing in ed­u­ca­tion and the labour mar­ket.</p>
    <p>It also as­sessed how aware a coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion was of cy­ber­se­cu­rity risks and the de­gree of ac­cess to tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia and the Nether­lands rounded off the top five in the list. The United States was 10th, while China was se­cond from the bot­tom in 49th place.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was lauded in par­tic­u­lar for in­te­grat­ing cy­ber se­cu­rity thor­oughly into its for­mal ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, in­clud­ing at the pri­mary and sec­ondary school lev­els. It came out tops in this cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>“Cru­cially, cy­ber se­cu­rity in­struc­tion is also incorporat­ed into sub­jects be­yond ICT (in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy) or com­puter sci­ence into sub­jects such as so­cial stud­ies, en­hanc­ing the qual­ity of in­struc­tion,” said Oliver Wy­man part­ner Alon Clif­fTa­vor on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“Many coun­tries fail to in­te­grate cy­ber se­cu­rity in­struc­tion across dis­ci­plines, and of­ten do not in­clude the sub­ject in pri­mary school­ing cur­ric­ula at all.”</p>
    <p>The index’s au­thors said in­creas­ing peo­ple’s aware­ness and mo­ti­va­tion on cy­ber is­sues should be a key el­e­ment of ev­ery coun­try’s de­fen­sive strat­egy, as stud­ies show that most cy­ber-se­cu­rity is­sues stem from hu­man er­ror.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ranked se­cond for aware­ness of and de­mand for cy­ber-se­cu­rity skills in the labour mar­ket, and third for the pop­u­la­tion’s com­mit­ment to prac­tis­ing cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Mr Cliff-Tavor pointed to the Repub­lic’s high rates of em­ploy­ment growth in sec­tors rel­e­vant to cy­ber se­cu­rity, and how stud­ies by soft­ware firms Kasper­sky and Mi­crosoft found that com­put­ers in Sin­ga­pore ex­pe­ri­enced lower rates of mal­ware en­coun­ters and lo­cal in­fec­tions com­pared with those in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“(This in­di­cates) a cy­ber lit­er­ate pop­u­la­tion with the abil­ity to pre­vent such events. Res­i­dents of Sin­ga­pore were also found to care­fully man­age their e-mails, pass­words and use of browsers com­pared with pop­u­la­tions of many other na­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore found it­self in the mid­dle of the pack in the index at 19th in the gov­ern­ment pol­icy cat­e­gory, which looked at the longterm vi­sion of coun­tries’ na­tional cy­ber-se­cu­rity strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Mr Cliff-Tavor said Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional cy­ber-se­cu­rity strat­egy has a broad cov­er­age of im­por­tant top­ics from ed­u­ca­tion to work­force devel­op­ment, but does not in­clude “strict qual­i­ta­tive or quan­ti­ta­tive met­rics and bench­marks to track suc­cess and en­sure ac­count­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>“This would be rare for gov­ern­ments to do in gen­eral. We have seen only Switzer­land and Es­to­nia (do this) as the prime ex­am­ples,” he added.</p>
    <p>“While gov­ern­ments set ap­pro­pri­ate pri­or­i­ties and goals, they con­sis­tently fail to com­mit the re­sources nec­es­sary for their suc­cess. Com­mit­ting fund­ing and up­dates on progress to en­sure ac­count­abil­ity are lack­ing in many ge­ogra­phies.”</p>
    <p>MORE CARE­FUL IN­TER­NET USE</p>
    <p>(This in­di­cates) a cy­ber lit­er­ate pop­u­la­tion with the abil­ity to pre­vent such events. Res­i­dents of Sin­ga­pore were also found to care­fully man­age their e-mails, pass­words and use of browsers com­pared with pop­u­la­tions of many other na­tions.’’</p>
    <p>MR ALON CLIFF-TAVOR, a part­ner of man­age­ment con­sul­tancy Oliver Wy­man, which pub­lishes the Cy­ber Risk Lit­er­acy and Ed­u­ca­tion Index. He cited stud­ies that found com­put­ers here had lower rates of mal­ware en­coun­ters and lo­cal in­fec­tions com­pared with those in other coun­tries.</p>
