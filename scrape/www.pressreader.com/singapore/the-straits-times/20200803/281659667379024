    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences (SUSS) is look­ing for a new home that will bring its stu­dents and staff un­der one roof.</p>
    <p>Its pres­i­dent, Pro­fes­sor Cheong Hee Kiat, said it is in dis­cus­sions with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion about a new cam­pus, although its lo­ca­tion has not been de­cided.</p>
    <p>“This would be a chance for us to fash­ion a new type of cam­pus,” he told The Straits Times, in a re­cent update on the univer­sity’s plans as it marks its 15th an­niver­sary this year.</p>
    <p>Since 2005, SUSS has been op­er­at­ing on rented premises at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment (SIM) site in Cle­menti.</p>
    <p>It rents Block C and par­tial spa­ces in Blocks A and B from SIM, as well as some spa­ces in Ngee Ann Polytech­nic, which are used for lec­tur­ers and other staff.</p>
    <p>Prof Cheong said: “We have been rent­ing for 15 years... Any univer­sity would like to have a place that stu­dents can be­long to.”</p>
    <p>Over the years, SUSS has ex­panded its full-time of­fer­ings – it now has nine such de­gree cour­ses, up from three in 2014.</p>
    <p>Its lat­est full-time in­take for the 2020 aca­demic year is be­tween 850 and 900, up from 580 in 2017.</p>
    <p>It has 13,000 part-time stu­dents, in­clud­ing grad­u­ate stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In­stead of hav­ing a large sprawl­ing cam­pus, the idea is to make use of a rea­son­able amount of space in an ef­fi­cient and cost-ef­fec­tive way, said Prof Cheong.</p>
    <p>“We want to be mo­bile, ag­ile and pro­vide suf­fi­cient fa­cil­i­ties for our stu­dents in a thought­ful way,” he said, adding that hav­ing large spa­ces to main­tain could drain re­sources and may push up the cost of ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The aim is for SUSS, as a so­cial sciences in­sti­tu­tion, to make learn­ing as ac­ces­si­ble as pos­si­ble to peo­ple, said Prof Cheong.</p>
    <p>“We are quite a dif­fer­ent univer­sity, and we are proud of that,” he said. SUSS will con­tinue to fo­cus on clos­ing the gaps in so­ci­ety, he said, and work­ing with so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions to help them do bet­ter in man­age­ment and op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ap­plied re­search is also an­other key em­pha­sis.</p>
    <p>“We let oth­ers do all the es­o­teric stuff, but we want to do ap­plied re­search that can be ap­plied in sec­tors or na­tion­ally,” said Prof Cheong.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, the univer­sity hopes to also raise its stand­ing glob­ally by join­ing re­gional con­sor­tiums that are aligned with its strengths.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, since 2017, SUSS has been a mem­ber of The Tal­loires Net­work, an in­ter­na­tional as­so­ci­a­tion of in­sti­tu­tions fo­cused on strength­en­ing the civic roles and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of higher ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>SUSS is also keen to ex­plore join­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the Asean Univer­sity Net­work to boost job and net­work­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents and help fac­ulty mem­bers learn from overseas con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Through th­ese tie-ups, SUSS also hopes to “es­tab­lish our rep­u­ta­tion and get peo­ple to know what sort of univer­sity we are”, Prof Cheong said.</p>
