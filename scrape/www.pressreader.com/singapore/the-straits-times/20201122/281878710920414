    <p>KABUL • Sev­eral rock­ets hit res­i­den­tial ar­eas dur­ing the early rush hour in the Afghan cap­i­tal Kabul yes­ter­day, killing at least eight civil­ians and wound­ing 31, po­lice of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for the at­tack.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on its Tele­gram chan­nels, the mil­i­tant group said 28 Katyusha rock­ets fired by “sol­diers of the caliphate” hit Kabul’s heav­ily for­ti­fied Green Zone that houses “the presidenti­al palace, em­bassies of Cru­sader states, and the head­quar­ters of Afghan forces”.</p>
    <p>The ex­plo­sions, close to the diplo­matic en­clave, sent warn­ing sirens blar­ing from em­bassies and came two days be­fore a ma­jor donor con­fer­ence for Afghanista­n in Geneva.</p>
    <p>Mr Tariq Arian, spokesman for the Min­istry of In­te­rior, said eight civil­ians had been killed in the at­tack and 31 wounded.</p>
    <p>A Health Min­istry of­fi­cial said five dead and 21 in­jured peo­ple were taken to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Mr Arian said “ter­ror­ists” mounted the rock­ets in a small truck and set them off, adding that an in­ves­ti­ga­tion is go­ing on to find out how the ve­hi­cle came in­side the city.</p>
    <p>Some res­i­dents filmed the rock­ets be­ing fired and posted the footage on so­cial me­dia. Sev­eral pic­tures cir­cu­lat­ing on Face­book showed dam­aged cars and a hole in the side of a build­ing.</p>
    <p>A pic­ture of a young brother and sis­ter, whom of­fi­cials said were killed in their home, was widely shared on Face­book.</p>
    <p>One of the rock­ets landed in the vicin­ity of the Ira­nian em­bassy and sev­eral frag­ments hit the main build­ing, but there were no ca­su­al­ties among the staff, the em­bassy said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Early this month, sev­eral gun­men stormed the Kabul Univer­sity cam­pus and killed at least 35, most of them stu­dents, and wounded more than 50. The at­tack was also claimed by ISIS.</p>
    <p>Since peace talks be­tween the Afghan govern­ment and the Tale­ban have stalled, at­tacks by the Tale­ban and other ex­trem­ist groups have been on the rise, es­pe­cially in the cap­i­tal that is home to more than five mil­lion Afghans.</p>
    <p>Tale­ban in­sur­gents, fight­ing against a for­eign-backed Kabul ad­min­is­tra­tion, de­nied in­volve­ment in the at­tack.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo trav­elled to Qatar yes­ter­day to meet an Afghan del­e­ga­tion and Tale­ban ne­go­tia­tors.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment said late Fri­day that Mr Pom­peo will meet sep­a­rately with the Afghan govern­ment and Tale­ban ne­go­ti­a­tion teams in the Gulf state of Qatar.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Pen­tagon said it would soon pull some 2,000 troops out of Afghanista­n, speed­ing up the time­line es­tab­lished in a Fe­bru­ary agree­ment be­tween Wash­ing­ton and the Tale­ban that en­vi­sions a full United States with­drawal by mid-next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly vowed to end “for­ever wars”, in­clud­ing in Afghanista­n, where Amer­ica’s long­est-ever con­flict be­gan with an in­va­sion to dis­lodge the Tale­ban fol­low­ing the Sept 11, 2001 at­tacks.</p>
