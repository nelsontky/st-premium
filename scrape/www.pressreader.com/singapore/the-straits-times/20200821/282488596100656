    <p>When you are on the go, pau and siew mai make quick and con­ve­nient snacks.</p>
    <p>You can get such old-fash­ioned hand­made dim sum items at Swee Hand­made Pau, lo­cated in a cof­fee shop in Seran­goon North Av­enue 2.</p>
    <p>Stall owner and chef Toh Cheng Hoon, 70, makes Siew Mai ($2 for three) by hand us­ing a fill­ing com­pris­ing lean pork, a small amount of pork lard, car­rot, ji­cama, red onion, spring onion and fish meat from ei­ther yel­low-tail fish or mack­erel. The meat from the fish helps bind the siew mai fill­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>The Chicken Gluti­nous Rice ($2) is also worth the calo­ries. Mr Toh uses a pre­mium brand of wine – Plum Blos­som Hua Tiao Chiew – to mar­i­nate the meat. Few food and bev­er­age own­ers go to such ex­pense for com­mer­cial cook­ing, but Mr Toh in­sists on stick­ing to his favourite brand as he loves eat­ing his own hand­made snacks.</p>
    <p>He adds in Man­darin: “I want peo­ple who eat my snacks to feel happy.”</p>
    <p>The chicken meat is well-in­fused with flavour. You can also taste the springy tex­ture of the gluti­nous rice, which has no mushy bits. The se­cret be­hind this is that Mr Toh sep­a­rates the gluti­nous rice after steam­ing and painstak­ingly mar­i­nates the cooked rice by hand so that ev­ery grain is well-coated in sea­son­ing.</p>
    <p>The Chicken Big Pau ($1.50) and Cof­fee Pau (70 cents) are also good. The skin of the Cof­fee Pau and the lo­tus paste fill­ing are rich with the aroma of cof­fee.</p>
    <p>WHERE: Swee Hand­made Pau, 01-41, Block 151 Seran­goon North Av­enue 2 MRT: Ko­van OPEN: 7am to 6pm (Wed­nes­days to Mon­days); closed on Tues­days</p>
