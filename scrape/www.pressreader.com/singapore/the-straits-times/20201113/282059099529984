    <p>CHANG­ING HABITS</p>
    <p>A lo­cal com­pany has found a way to re­cy­cle food that is thrown away, turn­ing it into an­i­mal feed and com­post that it sup­plies to lo­cal farms.</p>
    <p>Biotech­nol­ogy firm Ento In­dus­tries, a sub­sidiary of Tiong Lam Sup­plies, uses a spe­cial species of flies that feasts on food waste, pro­duc­ing bi­o­log­i­cal mat­ter that farm­ers con­sider black gold.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, food waste has in­creased by 30 per cent over the last decade.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency re­ported that 736,000 tonnes of food waste was gen­er­ated in 2018, the equiv­a­lent weight of 54,000 dou­ble-decker buses.</p>
    <p>Ento In­dus­tries’ ap­proach was among three ideas on tack­ling food waste dis­cussed at a vir­tual panel dis­cus­sion yes­ter­day, as part of the vir­tual Fes­ti­valForGood ini­tia­tive or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Cen­tre for So­cial En­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>Mod­er­ated by DBS Bank’s sus­tain­abil­ity and part­ner­ships lead for group strate­gic mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tion Mon­ica Datta, the hour-long ses­sion in­cluded speak­ers from so­cial en­ter­prises in Hong</p>
    <p>Kong, Tai­wan and Sin­ga­pore shar­ing the chal­lenges they faced set­ting up and suc­cess­fully run­ning their en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the un­pre­dictable na­ture of work­ing with live in­sects, Ento’s founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive, Mr Nathaniel Phua, said: “When work­ing with in­sects, we have to re­mind our­selves that they are liv­ing things, not ro­bots. We can­not type in a com­mand and ex­pect them to fol­low it. We re­alised it is a part­ner­ship be­tween us and the in­sects. We are re­ally learn­ing new things ev­ery day about their bi­ol­ogy and their be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany al­lows the lar­vae of black soldier flies to con­sume food waste, later har­vest­ing the in­sects for use as high-value feed in­gre­di­ents in the agri­cul­ture industry.</p>
    <p>The fae­ces pro­duced by the flies, which is packed with nu­tri­ents, is used as fer­tiliser for plant growth.</p>
    <p>An­other pan­el­list, Mr Ter­ence Hon, co-founder of Hong Kong­based re­tail chain Green­price, shared his ex­pe­ri­ence in set­ting up a com­pany that fa­cil­i­tates the re­selling of clear­ance lines or stock that has passed its best-be­fore date.</p>
    <p>“From the cus­tomers’ per­spec­tive, it is re­ally hard for them to ac­cept the con­cept (of pur­chas­ing food past the sell-by date),” he said. “We try to put up tast­ing dis­plays for them to try out, to prove that items past their best-be­fore date can still be tasty and ed­i­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yu-De Lee, who heads Tai­wan-based plat­form Tsaitung Agri­cul­ture, high­lighted the po­ten­tial of ap­ply­ing tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions to min­imise food waste.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, whose plat­form helps restau­rants buy pro­duce di­rectly from farm­ers, noted that data col­lected from sup­ply chain op­er­a­tions could help sell­ers fine-tune their de­mand-sup­ply ra­tio and of­fer more pre­dictabil­ity.</p>
