    <p>Nearly three weeks have passed since a Covid-19 case was last re­ported in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries, and some health ex­perts say the au­thor­i­ties can con­sider eas­ing the strict move­ment re­stric­tions on res­i­dents there.</p>
    <p>They have re­mained sub­ject to more strin­gent move­ment curbs in Sin­ga­pore, fol­low­ing the rapid and mas­sive out­break of the virus in dorms that be­gan in end-March.</p>
    <p>Apart from go­ing to work or to run es­sen­tial er­rands, work­ers are still largely re­stricted to their dorms, but can visit spec­i­fied re­cre­ation cen­tres on their rest days.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral health ex­perts The Straits Times spoke to noted that the Covid-19 situation in dorms has abated, though they dif­fered on when re­stric­tions on mi­grant work­ers should be lifted.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist Leong Hoe Nam said the au­thor­i­ties can now con­sider al­low­ing the work­ers more free­dom to move in the community, given that Sin­ga­pore crossed the 14-day mark without in­fec­tions in dorms last Wednesday. The last in­fec­tion in dorms was re­ported on Nov 10.</p>
    <p>There are al­ready many safe­guards in place to pre­vent an­other out­break in dor­mi­to­ries, such as rou­tine screen­ing of work­ers, manda­tory mask-wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, he said.</p>
    <p>While it would take 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion cy­cles of the virus, to fully en­sure that dor­mi­to­ries are free of Covid-19, Dr Leong said this time­line can be short­ened be­cause of the ex­ten­sive mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Even if an in­fected per­son goes out into the community, the dis­ease should not spread if ev­ery­one abides by the mask-wear­ing mea­sure and so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, he added. “With this ar­gu­ment in place, it makes sense for for­eign work­ers to have some nor­mal­ity.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said work­ers should be al­lowed back into the community when Sin­ga­pore moves to its next phase, as that would mean the whole community is ready for rapid con­tact trac­ing and test­ing.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have said Sin­ga­pore will en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing only when about 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion par­tic­i­pates in TraceTo­gether, a tech­nol­ogy-en­abled con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme. “With the wide­spread use of TraceTo­gether, it is much more pos­si­ble to halt an out­break quickly through ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing, test­ing and quar­an­tin­ing,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>Dr Ling Li Min, an in­fec­tious dis­eases physi­cian, urged cau­tion, not­ing that there are “pock­ets of asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions lurk­ing around”. This is ev­i­dent by new cases that emerged af­ter 15 days of no in­fec­tions in the community, she said. Three such cases have been re­ported since last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>She added that it is ex­pected that the au­thor­i­ties would take a “steady and grad­ual ap­proach” in re­lax­ing the strict mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from ST, the Man­power Min­istry said it will fur­ther ease the re­stric­tions on dorm res­i­dents if in­fec­tion rates are “sus­tained at low lev­els”.</p>
    <p>It has also worked with community groups to ar­range for or­gan­ised ex­cur­sions for res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, work­ers said they hope the rules can be re­laxed soon.</p>
    <p>Mr Sad­dam Mo­ham­mad, 27, a</p>
    <p>Bangladesh­i car­pen­ter who stays in a pur­pose-built dor­mi­tory, said his life re­volves around work.</p>
    <p>He said he re­ports to work al­most ev­ery day, and he re­turns to his dor­mi­tory straight af­ter. He hopes to be able to ven­ture out again “be­cause I’m very bored in the dorm”.</p>
    <p>But em­ploy­ers ST spoke to said that not all their work­ers seem keen on head­ing out, as most are fo­cused on mak­ing up for their in­come loss with over­time work.</p>
    <p>An owner of a con­struc­tion com­pany, who gave his name only as Mr Sal­man, 49, said his for­eign work­ers have been work­ing over­time daily. “While our work has been de­layed by six months, the dead­line set by our clients re­mains the same.”</p>
