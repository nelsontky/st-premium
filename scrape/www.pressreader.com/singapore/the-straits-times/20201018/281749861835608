    <p>They have been dat­ing for about a year and on Oct 25, Mr Ni­cholas Lim and his girl­friend Eleanor Teo will be board­ing an air­craft to­gether for the first time.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s des­ti­na­tion is no farflung lo­cale, but Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ restau­rant in an A-380 plane which will be parked at Changi Air­port next weekend and the one af­ter.</p>
    <p>The pair, who opted for the econ­omy cabin lunch at $50 each, are among the lucky 3,500 or so cus­tomers to get a seat for lunch or din­ner.</p>
    <p>More than 900 seats that were avail­able for SIA’s Restau­rant A380@Changi din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence were sold within 30 min­utes of book­ings open­ing last Mon­day. Prices ranged from $50 for econ­omy to $600 for suites.</p>
    <p>Two air­craft will be de­ployed, with guests oc­cu­py­ing about half the seats to stick to safe dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the meal, Ms Teo, a 31-year-old who works in a char­ity, and Mr Lim, 34, will get to ex­plore the world’s largest pas­sen­ger air­craft in the three hours they have on the plane.</p>
    <p>They also plan to catch the Har­ley Quinn: Birds Of Prey movie.</p>
    <p>Ms Teo, a fan of the DC Comics char­ac­ter, wanted to watch the movie when it was re­leased in cin­e­mas in Fe­bru­ary but hes­i­tated due to ris­ing Covid-19 cases then.</p>
    <p>“For $50 per per­son, the ex­pe­ri­ence is rea­son­ably priced, since you get a three-course meal, watch films on board and re­ceive a sou­venir,” said Mr Lim, who works in a non-govern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He is opt­ing for a Per­anakan meal of ayam tem­pra and brin­jal sam­bal, while Ms Teo has picked a Ja­panese-style lunch.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times spoke to five Sin­ga­pore­ans who pur­chased ei­ther the Restau­rant A380@Changi din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence or the SIA@Home pack­age, which of­fers cus­tomers first- or busi­ness-class meals de­liv­ered to their doorstep.</p>
    <p>SIA, which re­ported its first an­nual loss in its 48-year his­tory, launched the ini­tia­tives to en­gage cus­tomers amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>An­other ini­tia­tive, which would see SIA open­ing the doors to its train­ing cen­tre, will ac­cept book­ings from Nov 1.</p>
    <p>Those who se­cured a seat or meal said the din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence is “worth pay­ing for”.</p>
    <p>Ms Amy Tay booked a suites lunch for Oct 25 us­ing the 80,250 KrisF­lyer miles she took years to ac­cu­mu­late.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old au­di­tor said she has not trav­elled since 2017 due to fam­ily and per­sonal com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing spent five years in the United States, where she stud­ied at the Univer­sity of Michi­gan be­fore work­ing in New York City, Ms Tay said that board­ing an SIA flight al­ways gave her a “warm and fuzzy feel­ing when I see my fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2015, her then boyfriend Tan Si-Rong pro­posed while on a flight to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>She said the air­line gave her a cake, which trav­ellers could re­quest in ad­vance if they are trav­el­ling on their birthdays.</p>
    <p>“SIA has been good to me when times were good for them. I want to help them out now that times are tough,” she said.</p>
    <p>An­other cus­tomer, who wanted to be known only as Dr Goh, bought French chef Ge­orges Blanc’s first­class set of­fered un­der SIA@Home, which opened for or­ders on Oct 5. The meal was de­liv­ered on Oct 11. She had bought the meal to sup­port the air­line, out of con­cern that thou­sands of jobs in the avi­a­tion in­dus­try are at risk due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Chefs, bak­ers, even concierge staff may lose their jobs, not just the cabin crew and pi­lots,” the 50-yearold said.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh de­scribed the meal as out­stand­ing, adding that it was a won­der­ful ex­pe­ri­ence to have a three­star Miche­lin din­ner at home, es­pe­cially for her el­derly and vul­ner­a­ble par­ents and in-laws.</p>
