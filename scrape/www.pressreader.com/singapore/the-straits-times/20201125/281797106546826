    <p>•</p>
    <p>Malaysia recorded 2,188 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, beat­ing the record of 1,882 for its high­est daily to­tal set the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>There were four new Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties yes­ter­day, tak­ing the coun­try’s death toll to 341.</p>
    <p>The surge, the first time that cases have passed 2,000 in a sin­gle day, were mainly due to the Ter­atai clus­ter linked to fac­tory work­ers at sev­eral Top Glove fac­to­ries in Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases be­ing treated in hos­pi­tals has gone up to 14,353. Malaysia’s to­tal num­ber of cases now stands at 58,847.</p>
    <p>The Ter­atai clus­ter re­sulted in Se­lan­gor over­tak­ing Sabah as the coun­try’s new Covid-19 epi­cen­tre. The clus­ter, named af­ter the street where some of the fac­to­ries are lo­cated i n Klang town­ship, is</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s largest ac­tive clus­ter.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor­gen­eral, Tan Sri Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, said the clus­ter had 1,511 new in­fec­tions, or 69.1 per cent of yes­ter­day’s new cases.</p>
    <p>“Sev­eral med­i­cal and pub­lic health as­sis­tance teams have been mo­bilised to the af­fected ar­eas to con­duct preven­tion and con­trol ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing a large-scale Covid-19 screen­ing process,” said Dr Noor Hisham.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has said that 28 Top Glove fac­tory build­ings in Klang would be shut in phases to al­low for health checks of the work­ers and their dor­mi­to­ries, al­though it did not pro­vide a timetable.</p>
