    <p>The Ju-On and Grudge films – about a deadly curse that be­gins in a house in Tokyo and even­tu­ally spreads all the way to the United States – are fi­nally get­ting a proper ori­gin story.</p>
    <p>And it might be even more ter­ri­fy­ing than the movies be­cause it is more re­al­is­tic, ref­er­enc­ing real-life dis­as­ters and mur­ders that have hap­pened in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The new Net­flix se­ries, Ju-On: Ori­gins, serves as a pre­quel to the pop­u­lar hor­ror fran­chise, which be­gan in 1988 with two short films by di­rec­tor Takashi Shimizu and his 2000 di­rect-to-video movie Ju-On.</p>
    <p>The two decades that fol­lowed saw 12 more movies, in­clud­ing a spin-off Hol­ly­wood film se­ries book­ended by The Grudge (2004) – a re­make of Shimizu’s 2002 Ju-On: The Grudge star­ring Sarah Michelle Gel­lar – and The Grudge, star­ring John Cho, which was re­leased ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The new Ja­panese-lan­guage se­ries is helmed by film-maker Sho Miyake, whose eclec­tic re­sume in­cludes the ac­claimed com­ing-ofage tale And Your Bird Can Sing (2018) and hip-hop doc­u­men­tary The Cock­pit (2015).</p>
    <p>Miyake had never ven­tured into the scary or su­per­nat­u­ral be­fore, but the se­ries’ writ­ers – hor­ror mae­stros Takashige Ichise (Dark Wa­ter, 2002) and Hiroshi Taka­hashi (Ringu, 1998) – asked that he come on board.</p>
    <p>In a trans­lated e-mail in­ter­view, Miyake tells The Straits Times the brief he re­ceived from the writ­ers and pro­duc­ers was to craft a con­vinc­ing pre­quel to the film fran­chise.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, I tried to make its tone and style more re­al­is­tic than the movies,” ex­plains the 36-yearold.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing they told me to do was to make it raw and vivid. So, I wanted the ac­tors to de­liver a per­for­mance that was grounded in re­al­ity and for the au­di­ence to ex­pe­ri­ence the raw­ness of what may hap­pen in real life.”</p>
    <p>Set in the 1980s, Ju-On: Ori­gins fol­lows sev­eral peo­ple who find them­selves drawn to an aban­doned house on the out­skirts of town.</p>
    <p>One of them is Haruka (Yuina Kuroshima), a young ac­tress who has been haunted by the sound of foot­steps in her home ever since her fi­ance Tet­suya (Kai Inowaki) vis­ited the cursed spot and be­gan be­hav­ing strangely.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she en­lists the help of para­nor­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tor Ya­suo (Yoshiyoshi Arakawa) to get to the bot­tom of this, they and sev­eral oth­ers en­counter the two malev­o­lent spirits that fans of the movies know all too well: Kayako and Toshio, ghosts of a mother and son hor­rif­i­cally mur­dered there.</p>
    <p>Miyake wanted to ground the su­per­nat­u­ral story in real events that took place in Ja­pan dur­ing that time pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“One of my chal­lenges in cre­at­ing the orig­i­nal tele­vi­sion se­ries was to ex­press his­tor­i­cal con­text,” he says.</p>
    <p>Thus the show in­cor­po­rates ac­tual news footage from the Great Han­shin Earth­quake and the Tokyo sub­way sarin at­tack of 1995 as well as re­ports of sev­eral well-known mur­der cases that have taken place in Ja­pan since the 1980s.</p>
    <p>It also ref­er­ences is­sues such as do­mes­tic vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>But above all, the se­ries sets out to chan­nel the essence of what made the films so mem­o­rably ter­ri­fy­ing: “a feel­ing of fear that tran­scends lan­guage and cul­ture and was clearly ex­pressed by vis­ual and sound di­rec­tion as well as sim­ple and mas­ter­ful sto­ry­lines”, Miyake says.</p>
    <p>This is why “when the first Ju-On movie was re­leased, it trau­ma­tised me and other young view­ers”, he re­calls.</p>
    <p>Like iconic Ja­panese hor­ror films such as the Ring fran­chise (1998 to 2002), Ju-On will also con­jure a sense of dread sur­round­ing every­day items, par­tic­u­larly those used to com­mu­ni­cate.</p>
    <p>“In this se­ries, TVs and phones ap­pear fre­quently. And given that the show is be­ing streamed all over the world, I think it could be in­ter­est­ing to imag­ine how me­dia and fear are re­lated to each other,” the di­rec­tor says.</p>
    <p>But he hints that fans can ex­pect a fair share of the scares here to be in-your-face rather than psy­cho­log­i­cal.</p>
    <p>“Fear can be evoked by show­ing a bal­ance of vis­i­ble and in­vis­i­ble things, but the Ju-on films have used vis­i­ble fears more and I wanted to main­tain the same tech­nique here.”</p>
