    <p>Te­masek said its se­nior in­ter­na­tional busi­ness ad­viser Liew Mun Leong has con­trib­uted to Sin­ga­pore and its peo­ple, and his track record at var­i­ous firms at­tests to that.</p>
    <p>The in­vest­ment com­pany’s com­ments come days af­ter the High Court ac­quit­ted Mr Liew’s for­mer In­done­sian maid of theft, in a judg­ment that also raised ques­tions about the motivation of Mr Liew and his fam­ily in lodg­ing a po­lice re­port against the maid. Mr Liew is also the chair­man of Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong.</p>
    <p>Te­masek In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive Dil­han Pil­lay said yes­ter­day: “There are many in­di­vid­u­als who have con­trib­uted to both pub­lic ser­vice and to the pri­vate sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore, for the ben­e­fit of Sin­ga­pore and our pop­u­la­tion as a whole. Liew Mun Leong is one of those per­sons, and his track record at Cap­i­ta­Land, at Changi Air­port Group and at Sur­bana Jurong at­tests to that.”</p>
    <p>Cap­i­ta­Land and Sur­bana Jurong are Te­masek port­fo­lio com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to ques­tions from The Straits Times at a vir­tual me­dia con­fer­ence on Te­masek’s per­for­mance, and was asked whether Mr Liew’s ac­tions go against the com­pany’s val­ues and whether it would be look­ing into the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Mr Pil­lay said he would not com­ment fur­ther, cit­ing on­go­ing pro­ceed­ings on the case. The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers and Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) have said they are study­ing the judg­ment to see what fur­ther ac­tion ought to be taken.</p>
    <p>He added: “I think we should hear from Mr Liew on his side of the is­sue and not come quick to judg­ment un­til we have heard all sides of things.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liew had de­clined to com­ment on the judg­ment when con­tacted by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the High Court ac­quit­ted for­mer do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani of steal­ing from Mr Liew, who is also the for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cap­i­ta­Land, and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, 46, who worked for the Liew fam­ily from 2007 to 2016, was ac­cused of steal­ing more than $34,000 worth of items from them.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn cited, among other things, the im­proper mo­tive be­hind the al­le­ga­tions of some fam­ily mem­bers. He noted that “some time prior to her ter­mi­na­tion”, Ms Parti had ex­pressed un­hap­pi­ness at be­ing made to do the ad­di­tional work of clean­ing the house and of­fice of Mr Liew’s son Karl.</p>
    <p>“There is rea­son to be­lieve that the Liew fam­ily, upon real­is­ing her un­hap­pi­ness, took the pre-emp­tive first step to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment sud­denly with­out giv­ing her suf­fi­cient time for her to pack, in the hope that Parti would not use the time to make a com­plaint to MOM,” the judge noted.</p>
    <p>When Ms Parti threat­ened to com­plain to MOM af­ter her sud­den ter­mi­na­tion, Mr Liew and his son fol­lowed up with a po­lice re­port to pre­vent her re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to make the com­plaint, said the judge.</p>
