    <p>After re­ceiv­ing their A-level re­sults ear­lier this year, Ms Max­ine Cassandra Lau and Ms Grace Shani An­thony had no idea what to do next.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-olds had been close friends since their time in CHIJ Pri­mary (Toa Payoh). Un­sure about what to study at uni­ver­sity, they de­cided to take a gap year.</p>
    <p>Ms Lau, who had been at An­gloChi­nese Ju­nior Col­lege, and Ms An­thony, who had been at Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion, de­cided to make a dif­fer­ence to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ms An­thony, a na­tional trackand-field ath­lete, roped in her team­mate Kamp­ton Kam, 19, who was from Vic­to­ria Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Said Ms An­thony: “We bounced ideas off each other, but we knew we wanted to help the el­derly as they were one of the more af­fected groups dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic – they were more vul­ner­a­ble to the coro­n­avirus and they had a lot more re­stric­tions.”</p>
    <p>Many of their friends had also said their grand­par­ents did not want to leave their homes ow­ing to safety con­cerns, which fur­ther iso­lated them from the rest of the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Ms Lau added: “Kamp­ton and I don’t live with our grand­par­ents, so we couldn’t see them at all. They were all alone, and it got us think­ing that other peo­ple’s grand­par­ents are also liv­ing alone, so we were wor­ried and we wanted to help in that area.”</p>
    <p>The three fi­nally set­tled on pre­par­ing cot­ton plant seed kits to be dis­trib­uted to se­niors liv­ing in the Feng­shan area in Be­dok. Work­ing with The Sal­va­tion Army, they have pre­pared 120 kits thus far.</p>
    <p>Fifty kits will be used in ther­apy ses­sions at Peace­haven Nurs­ing Home in Up­per Changi.</p>
    <p>The group made their first rounds of home vis­its on Mon­day and are plan­ning to make a se­cond round to­day.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for The Sal­va­tion Army Peace­haven said he hoped the teenagers’ ini­tia­tive would “in­spire more peo­ple to give back to so­ci­ety in creative ways”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a joy to work with the young gen­er­a­tion who are con­cerned for se­niors in the com­mu­nity as many of them are so­cially iso­lated,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>Ms An­thony said the group chose cot­ton seeds be­cause they are eas­ier to grow than edi­ble plants and herbs.</p>
    <p>She said: “My fam­ily grows cot</p>
    <p>A spokesman for The Sal­va­tion Army Peace­haven said he hoped the teenagers’ ini­tia­tive would “in­spire more peo­ple to give back to so­ci­ety in creative ways”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a joy to work with the young gen­er­a­tion who are con­cerned for se­niors in the com­mu­nity as many of them are so­cially iso­lated,” the spokesman added.</p>
    <p>ton plants in our gar­den at home. My grandma, who lives with us, finds it very fun to play with cot­ton at home. She loves it.”</p>
    <p>The trio hope that be­sides pro­vid­ing the se­niors with a source of en­ter­tain­ment, the plants will also give them a sense of pur­pose.</p>
    <p>“We are hop­ing to teach them craft­ing skills that they could put to use in the fu­ture, with the cot­ton they get from their plant,” said Ms Lau.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing these ses­sions, they could craft lit­tle toys to be do­nated. This way, they would be able to see the fruit of their ef­fort ben­e­fit oth­ers, pro­vid­ing them with a greater sense of ful­fil­ment and pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>The project is cur­rently self­funded by the three friends. They are doc­u­ment­ing the jour­ney on an In­sta­gram page (@clover_sg).</p>
    <p>Said Mr Kam, who is cur­rently serv­ing his na­tional ser­vice: “I felt my NS al­lowance could be put to bet­ter use, so why not help oth­ers dur­ing this pe­riod?”</p>
    <p>Ms An­thony added that she had sav­ings from when she took on a part-time role at a clinic ear­lier this year, and de­cided “to con­trib­ute some money I earned since I don’t need the money ur­gently now”.</p>
    <p>Ms Lau, who is cur­rently do­ing a re­search in­tern­ship at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, added: “The av­er­age seed kit costs a dol­lar. I feel that we are in a very priv­i­leged po­si­tion... so we would like to do our part for the com­mu­nity.”</p>
