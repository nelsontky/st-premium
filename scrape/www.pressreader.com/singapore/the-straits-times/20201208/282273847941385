    <p>Strong fi­nan­cial mar­kets, in­vestor ap­petite and liq­uid­ity are set to make this month un­usu­ally warm for fund-rais­ing ac­tiv­ity in Asia af­ter al­ready clock­ing a record this year with US$355.4 bil­lion (S$475 bil­lion) raised, ac­cord­ing to fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>The first four days of this month saw 43 deals in Asia raise US$12.7 bil­lion, Refini­tiv data showed, three times the amount dur­ing the same pe­riod last year, with Hong Kong and China ac­count­ing for the big­gest share.</p>
    <p>At least US$3 bil­lion worth of ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs) are likely to be fi­nalised in Hong Kong this month, ac­cord­ing to bankers work­ing on those deals.</p>
    <p>Those trans­ac­tions will fur­ther bol­ster this year’s all-time high, which so far rep­re­sents a 56.3 per cent in­crease over the same pe­riod last year, and will eclipse the pre­vi­ous record of US$306.2 bil­lion in 2010, Refini­tiv data showed.</p>
    <p>The Asia cap­i­tal-rais­ing rush is a ma­jor fee earner for in­vest­ment banks in the re­gion which could help off­set a de­cline in in­come in other key ar­eas of their busi­nesses around the world.</p>
    <p>“Stocks in Novem­ber have had one of the best months ever, and we are see­ing sus­tained in­flows into global eq­ui­ties,” said Mr Wil­liam Smi­ley, co-head of eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets in Asia ex-Ja­pan at Gold­man Sachs.</p>
    <p>“With sig­nif­i­cant de­mand for emerg­ing mar­kets and China growth, Asia is at the heart of that ac­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>Travel re­stric­tions due to the Covid-19 pan­demic have also re­sulted in ex­ec­u­tives and bankers in re­gional hubs such as Hong Kong can­celling tra­di­tional De­cem­ber and Jan­uary holiday plans, mean­ing there has been no slow­down in deals.</p>
    <p>“There are still size­able trans­ac­tions go­ing on, and it seems there will still be quite a bit of ac­tiv­ity well into De­cem­ber,” said Her­bert Smith Free­hills China man­ag­ing part­ner Matt Em­s­ley, adding that there was “a solid pipe­line” go­ing into next year.</p>
    <p>An eq­uity cap­i­tal mar­kets banker at a Wall Street lender in Hong Kong said there was no doubt the run will be sus­tained at least un­til the year end.</p>
    <p>“There’s no such thing as a week­end at the mo­ment,” said the banker. One lawyer said Satur­day evening phone calls with di­rec­tors were now com­mon ahead of deals launch­ing early the fol­low­ing week.</p>
    <p>Smart­phone maker Xiaomi raised US$3.91 bil­lion in an eq­uity top-up place­ment and con­vert­ible bond sale last week, the largest deal of its type ever car­ried out in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Last week, JD Health In­ter­na­tional also raised US$3.5 bil­lion in Hong Kong’s largest IPO of the year.</p>
    <p>“If peo­ple were hop­ing to put their feet up and catch their breath in th­ese fi­nal weeks of the year, I’m not sure we’re go­ing to get that op­por­tu­nity,” said Mr Ryan Holsheimer, JP Mor­gan head of cash eq­ui­ties and eq­uity dis­tri­bu­tion for Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
