        SINGAPORE A19 THE SUNDAY TIMES SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2020 | | | ’’ RE SE T 2021 WEBINAR SERIE S What would a Biden administra­tion mean for Asia? The webinar will feature a wide-ranging conversati­on with ambassador­s-at-large at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tommy Koh and Chan Heng Chee, both former ambassador­s to the United States. Both also have experience of working with US President-elect
Joe Biden during their diplomatic careers. During the conversati­on, we will explore the likely foreign policy priorities of a Biden administra­tion, how it will manage the United States’ relationsh­ips with China, Asean and the rest of Asia, its likely approaches to trade policies and climate change and how these will differ from those of the Trump administra­tion. The Straits Times’ bureau chief in Washington, Nirmal Ghosh and global affairs correspond­ent Benjamin Kang Lim will also participat­e in the panel discussion, which will be moderated by ST’s Associate Editor Vikram Khanna.
