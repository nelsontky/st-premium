    <p>Vet­eran Hong Kong ac­tress Angie Chiu has played the de­mure damsel op­po­site lead­ing men like Chow Yun Fat and Adam Cheng in drama se­ri­als in her youth.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter known as Zhao Yazhi, Chiu is turn­ing 66 this Sun­day, but looks ageless.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, she posted pic­tures of an early birth­day cel­e­bra­tion on Weibo and wrote: “Fresh flow­ers with good food, nice scenery with good friends.”</p>
    <p>She tagged her good friends – ac­tress Sharon Yang, for­mer ac­tress Agassi Wang and film cos­tume de­signer Bobo Ng – in the post.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, for­mer ac­tor Melvin Wong, 71, was also in some of the photos.</p>
    <p>Chiu was praised by fans for her youth­ful looks, with some say­ing she is more beau­ti­ful than the flow­ers.</p>
    <p>Some fans also no­ticed the lav­ish house where the cel­e­bra­tion took place, say­ing it looked like a mini­palace with chan­de­liers and great in­te­rior de­sign.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Hong Kong me­dia, the party was held at Wang’s house.</p>
    <p>Chiu and Wong have a son, ac­tor Wes­ley Wong, 33, who ap­peared in lo­cal di­rec­tor Jack Neo’s navythemed movie Ah Boys To Men 3: Frog­men (2015), where he played bad boy re­cruit Black Dragon.</p>
    <p>She also has two sons from her pre­vi­ous mar­riage to Dr Wong Hon Wai.</p>
    <p>Chiu, who starred in TVB se­ri­als such as The Heaven Sword And Dragon Sabre (1978), Chor Lau He­ung (1979) and The Bund (1980), also fa­mously played Lady White Snake in the Tai­wan drama se­rial, The Leg­end Of White Snake (1992), along­side ac­tress Ce­cilia Yip.</p>
