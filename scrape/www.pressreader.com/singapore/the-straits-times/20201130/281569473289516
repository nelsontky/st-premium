    <p>Cus­tomers can now choose from about 17,000 items on the iShopChang­i plat­form, more than triple the num­ber avail­able be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break struck.</p>
    <p>That is one of the ways Changi Air­port Group (CAG) has moved to help re­tail­ers at the air­port reach out to non-trav­ellers in Sin­ga­pore, as in­ter­na­tional travel re­mains at a stand­still amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>CAG said on­line sales by Changi Air­port re­tail­ers have sur­passed pre-pan­demic num­bers, though it did not pro­vide spe­cific fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Said CAG spokesman Ivan Tan: “Cur­rently, more than 90 per cent of our cus­tomers are non-trav­ellers... Wines and spir­its, beauty and elec­tron­ics con­tinue to be most pop­u­lar with our cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>The pivot to on­line sales comes with barely any trav­ellers pass­ing though the air­port. Pas­sen­ger traf­fic re­mains at less than 5 per cent of what it was be­fore the pan­demic, and re­tail sales at Changi Air­port have plunged 74 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>At Ter­mi­nal 1 and Ter­mi­nal 3, which have re­mained open, only about half of the out­lets in the tran­sit ar­eas are op­er­at­ing. Op­er­a­tions at T4 have been sus­pended, while T2 re­mains closed af­ter plans for up­grad­ing works were brought for­ward.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said work has been done to trans­form Changi’s food and bev­er­age busi­ness through the launch of the Changi Eats food de­liv­ery ser­vice in June. There are now 40 brands of­fer­ing over 800 food, drink and snack items on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>He said the num­ber of or­ders re­ceived had grown al­most five­fold since its launch, prov­ing it was “plug­ging a mar­ket gap and demon­strat­ing how we are val­ueadding to our cus­tomers”.</p>
    <p>CAG has also helped busi­nesses in ar­eas such as rental re­bates, shorter op­er­at­ing hours and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. Most re­cently, it launched shop­ping tours of its tran­sit ar­eas, held on week­ends and by in­vi­ta­tion only. They are tar­geted at cus­tomers who would other­wise have been trav­el­ling and shop­ping at Changi dur­ing the year-end hol­i­day pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said: “These shop­ping tours al­low us to con­tinue to en­gage our cus­tomers and share our deep knowl­edge of travel re­tail prod­ucts with them.”</p>
