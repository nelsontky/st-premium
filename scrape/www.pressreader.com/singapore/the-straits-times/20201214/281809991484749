    <p>Smart, hu­mor­ous and firm.</p>
    <p>These traits stand out for peo­ple who have come to know Mr Bobby Na­su­tion, the son-in-law of Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, who is set to be the new mayor of Medan, the pro­vin­cial cap­i­tal of North Su­ma­tra.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign team mem­ber In­dra Gu­nawan, 47, who has known Mr Bobby, also called Muham­mad Afif, for a year, said he was quick in un­der­stand­ing is­sues and swift in mak­ing de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t frit­ter money un­nec­es­sar­ily. He is able to lighten up a tense sit­u­a­tion with jokes but his jokes are not slap­stick. He is also direct when point­ing out mis­takes,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing a po­lit­i­cal novice, the 29-year-old Mr Bobby re­ceived the back­ing of some of the big­gest po­lit­i­cal par­ties, in­clud­ing Mr Joko’s In­done­sian Demo­cratic Party of Strug­gle.</p>
    <p>He and his deputy, Gerindra Party’s Au­lia Rah­man, won against in­cum­bent Akhyar Na­su­tion and deputy can­di­date Sal­man Al­farisi by about 10 per­cent­age points, ac­cord­ing to un­of­fi­cial tal­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Bobby mar­ried the pres­i­dent’s only daugh­ter, Kahiyang Ayu, 29, in Novem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have two chil­dren – Sedah Mi­rah, two, and Panem­ba­han Al Nahyan, born in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The youngest of three chil­dren of a for­mer di­rec­tor of a state-owned plan­ta­tion firm, Mr Bobby has a mas­ter’s de­gree in busi­ness man­age­ment from Bo­gor Agri­cul­tural Univer­sity, out­side Jakarta. That was also where he met his wife, a fel­low student.</p>
    <p>Mr Bobby started in the real es­tate busi­ness a decade ago, ren­o­vat­ing and re­selling homes. In 2016, he joined prop­erty firm Takke Group as its marketing di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>He has in­di­cated an in­ter­est in pol­i­tics for some time. In De­cem­ber 2018, Mr Joko said “po­lit­i­cal feel­ings have be­gun to en­ter Bobby”.</p>
    <p>One ad­van­tage Mr Bobby has as a politi­cian is that he is no stranger to the lime­light. Of­ten smil­ing, he has been a guest on sev­eral lo­cal TV shows where he would launch into song and freely share his love story.</p>
    <p>His open­ness is also re­flected in his so­cial me­dia posts, where he shares about play­ing bad­minton – and re­veals snip­pets of fam­ily life. In one In­sta­gram photo of him­self and his baby girl, he wrote: “Papa, why is your mous­tache so sexy.”</p>
