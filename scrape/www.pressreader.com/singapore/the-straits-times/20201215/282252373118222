    <p>Bank of China has sued BP in Singapore, as well as Hin Leong Trad­ing (HLT) founder Lim Oon Kuin and his two chil­dren, over a to­tal of US$312.9 mil­lion (S$417 mil­lion) in the lat­est ef­fort by a cred­i­tor to re­cover losses af­ter one of the big­gest trad­ing scan­dals in decades.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese bank re­quested that BP re­pay US$125.7 mil­lion that it with­drew from the lender ear­lier this year based on sales of gasoil car­goes to Hin Leong, ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments pro­vided by the Supreme Court of Singapore.</p>
    <p>The deals were part of a “fic­ti­tious pur­chase scheme con­spir­acy” to main­tain Hin Leong’s liq­uid­ity since no real trans­ac­tions took place, the bank said.</p>
    <p>The lender also de­manded US$187.2 mil­lion from Lim, bet­ter</p>
    <p>known as O. K. Lim, and his two chil­dren, the doc­u­ments showed. The to­tal sum in­cludes the deals linked to BP and some other over­due pay­ments on short-term loans, or let­ters of credit.</p>
    <p>BP strongly re­futes the al­le­ga­tions by Bank of China and will de­fend its po­si­tion, the com­pany said in a state­ment, with­out elab­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>Bank of China and the Lim fam­ily did not re­ply to e-mails seek­ing com­ments. Lim had ear­lier de­nied forg­ing doc­u­ments in a case brought by HSBC Hold­ings, say­ing they were “mis­tak­enly” is­sued.</p>
    <p>Singapore, a ma­jor oil trad­ing hub, was shaken by de­faults and al­leged fraud ear­lier this year, roil­ing lenders who fi­nance the opaque world of com­modi­ties trad­ing in the city state.</p>
    <p>While the main pro­tag­o­nists were medium-sized trad­ing firms such as Hin Leong, some lead­ing global firms have also been en­snared in the de­ba­cle.</p>
    <p>This is not the only hit Bank of China has taken this year on oil. Ear­lier this year, it agreed to re­pay some in­vestors af­ter one of its oillinked trad­ing prod­ucts col­lapsed amid a plunge in crude prices.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong’s cred­i­tors, which also in­clude HSBC and Singapore’s DBS Group Hold­ings, are fight­ing to re­cover funds from the in­sol­vent firm, which has US$3.5 bil­lion in out­stand­ing debt.</p>
    <p>Bank of China’s case, filed late last month, came af­ter HSBC and the trader’s court-ap­pointed man­agers Price­wa­ter­house­Coop­ers started tak­ing le­gal ac­tion against the Lim fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The dis­puted gasoil deals took place in the first two months of this year. BP with­drew a to­tal of US$125.7 mil­lion on three let­ters of credit in early Fe­bru­ary from Bank of China, the court doc­u­ments showed.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong pur­chased a com­bined 1.5 mil­lion bar­rels of gasoil from BP in the trans­ac­tions and the oil ma­jor was able to present doc­u­ments to prove the au­then­tic­ity of the trades.</p>
    <p>The bank was later in­formed by Hin Leong’s ju­di­cial man­agers that th­ese trades were fab­ri­ca­tions backed by non-ex­is­tent car­goes fi­nanced by at least 27 let­ters of credit, in­clud­ing the three from Bank of China.</p>
    <p>The suit al­leges that Hin Leong was able to main­tain a sem­blance of fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity and liq­uid­ity by selling and re­pur­chas­ing forged car­goes backed by let­ters of credit worth US$624 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“HLT fab­ri­cated doc­u­ments on a mas­sive scale,” Bank of China said in its suit.</p>
    <p>“The forged doc­u­ments en­abled HLT to mis­lead banks into ex­tend­ing fi­nanc­ing to it and also acted as sup­port­ing doc­u­men­ta­tion for fic­ti­tious gains or prof­its.”</p>
    <p>Bank of China cited the court-ap­pointed man­ager as say­ing that the trad­ing firm sold gasoil to BP, which the oil ma­jor then sold back to Hin Leong at a higher price. Given the gap be­tween the sales and pur­chase prices and the short time pe­riod be­tween the deals, it ap­pears that the trans­ac­tions were in­tended solely to pro­vide liq­uid­ity for Hin Leong, the bank said, cit­ing the ap­pointed man­agers.</p>
    <p>Bank of China claimed that it was not aware of the “si­mul­ta­ne­ous sale” and buy-back trans­ac­tions, al­leg­ing that doc­u­ments were forged to “in­duce” the bank to make pay­ments. It would not have made pay­ments if it had known that the rep­re­sen­ta­tions were false, it said.</p>
