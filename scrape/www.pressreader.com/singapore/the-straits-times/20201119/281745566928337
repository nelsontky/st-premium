    <p>PUERTO CABEZAS (Nicaragua) • Un­leash­ing tor­ren­tial floods even as it weak­ened, Storm Iota churned through Cen­tral Amer­ica on Tues­day, caus­ing swollen rivers to burst their banks, flip­ping roofs onto streets and killing at least nine peo­ple across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The strong­est storm on record to reach Nicaragua, Iota struck the coast late on Mon­day, bring­ing winds of nearly 250km per hour and flood­ing vil­lages still reel­ing from the im­pact of Hur­ri­cane Eta two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>But by Tues­day night, the winds had fallen to around 80kmh as Iota weak­ened to a trop­i­cal storm but heavy rain­fall con­tin­ued, the US Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>Iota was drench­ing al­ready sat­u­rated towns and vil­lages as it moved in­land over south­ern Hon­duras and as the au­thor­i­ties re­ported many peo­ple miss­ing with some of the worst-hit ar­eas still cut off.</p>
    <p>“We’re flooded ev­ery­where, the rain lasted al­most all night and now it stops for an hour then comes back for two to three hours,” said Mr Marcelo Her­rera, mayor of Wam­pusirpi, a mu­nic­i­pal­ity in the in­te­rior of north-east Hon­duras crossed by rivers and streams. “We need food and wa­ter for the pop­u­la­tion, be­cause we lost our crops with Eta.”</p>
    <p>The Hon­duran gov­ern­ment closed bridges and high­ways on Tues­day, while open­ing more than 600 shel­ters where some 13,000 res­i­dents sought refuge.</p>
    <p>The dou­ble punch of Eta and Iota marked the first time two ma­jor hur­ri­canes had formed in the At­lantic basin in No­vem­ber since records be­gan.</p>
    <p>The Nicaraguan port of Puerto Cabezas, still partly flooded and strewn with de­bris left by Eta, again bore the brunt of the hit.</p>
    <p>Fright­ened res­i­dents were hud­dled in shel­ters on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“We could die. There is noth­ing to eat at all,” said Ms Ino­cen­cia Smith at one of the shel­ters.</p>
    <p>“The wind is too strong,” said Ms Jessi Urbina, a res­i­dent of the badly dam­aged El Muelle neigh­bour­hood i n the Nicaraguan town of Bilwi. “It took ev­ery­thing: The wooden roof and the win­dows of my house, which is made of con­crete.”</p>
    <p>Nicaraguan Vice-Pres­i­dent Rosario Murillo said at least six peo­ple had died as they were dragged down by rag­ing rivers.</p>
    <p>The wind also tore the roof off a makeshift hos­pi­tal. Pa­tients in in­ten­sive care were evac­u­ated, in­clud­ing two women who gave birth dur­ing the first rains on Mon­day, the Nicaraguan of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Two peo­ple died on Prov­i­den­cia is­land, part of Colom­bia’s Caribbean ar­chi­pel­ago near the coast of Cen­tral Amer­ica, after it was clipped by Iota, Pres­i­dent Ivan Duque said on Tues­day evening.</p>
    <p>Nearly all of the in­fra­struc­ture on Prov­i­den­cia – home to some 6,000 peo­ple – had been dam­aged or de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>Panama’s gov­ern­ment said a per­son had died in its western Ngabe-Bu­gle re­gion be­cause of con­di­tions caused by the storm.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent of Brus La­guna on the Hon­duran coast told lo­cal ra­dio that a boy was killed by a fall­ing tree.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties (IFRC) said flood­ing from Iota risked caus­ing dis­as­ter after Eta.</p>
    <p>“We are very con­cerned about the po­ten­tial for deadly land­slides in these ar­eas as the soil is al­ready com­pletely sat­u­rated,” IFRC spokesman Matthew Cochrane said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>About 100,000 Nicaraguan­s and Hon­durans had been evac­u­ated from their homes, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Iota was some 56km south-east of the Hon­duran cap­i­tal and was mov­ing west at 19kmh where it could pro­voke “cat­a­strophic flash flood­ing and mud­slides”, the Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said, adding that Iota could dump up to 76cm of rain in some ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“We are in the hands of God. If I have to climb up trees, I’ll do it,” said Mr Jaime Ca­bal Cu, a farmer in Gu­atemala’s Iz­a­bal prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have food, but we are go­ing to wait here for the hur­ri­cane that we’re ask­ing God to stop from com­ing.”</p>
    <p>The re­cent state­ment by</p>
    <p>Chris Krebs on the se­cu­rity of the 2020 Elec­tion was highly in­ac­cu­rate, in that there were mas­sive im­pro­pri­eties and fraud – in­clud­ing dead peo­ple vot­ing, Poll Watch­ers not al­lowed into polling lo­ca­tions, ‘glitches’ in the vot­ing ma­chines which changed votes from Trump to Bi­den, late vot­ing and many more.</p>
    <p>U.S. PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP, in a tweet on Tues­day, adding that he was ter­mi­nat­ing Mr Christo­pher Krebs “ef­fec­tive im­me­di­ately”.</p>
