    <p>There were no new Covid-19 cases de­tected in pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries for the first time since March 28, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said last night.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also re­ported no new in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity for the third day in a row.</p>
    <p>Still, 10 new Covid-19 cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,859.</p>
    <p>Of these, nine were im­ported and one was a case re­sid­ing in a dor­mi­tory who had been iden­ti­fied ear­lier as a con­tact of pre­vi­ous cases.</p>
    <p>He had al­ready been quar­an­tined and was tested dur­ing his quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Among the nine im­ported cases was a per­ma­nent res­i­dent. The 42-year-old had re­turned from the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>An­other six cases are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, of which one ar­rived from Canada, three from the Philip­pines and two from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two i mported cases were crew mem­bers of a ship that ar­rived i n Sin­ga­pore from Malaysia on Sept 23.</p>
    <p>They had re­mained on the ship un­til they were trans­ferred to a quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>All im­ported cases were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice (SHN) upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore. They were tested while serv­ing their SHN at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks, said the MOH.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With seven cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,660 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 37 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, in­clud­ing one in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the i nten­sive care unit, while 120 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
