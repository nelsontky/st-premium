    <p>As In­dia and China con­tinue with mil­i­tary and diplo­matic talks on their dis­puted border, their troops in the Ladakh re­gion now have to grap­ple with de­te­ri­o­rat­ing weather con­di­tions as win­ter sets in.</p>
    <p>At Pan­gong Tso, a Hi­malayan lake, where Chi­nese and In­dian troops are in a stand-off, tem­per­a­tures of­ten drop to sub-zero.</p>
    <p>Tem­per­a­ture dur­ing the win­ter, start­ing next month till Fe­bru­ary, will plum­met to mi­nus 40 deg C and the lake, which cuts through Chi­nese and In­dian ter­ri­to­ries, will freeze over.</p>
    <p>The area is known as the “cold desert”, ac­cord­ing to re­tired army colonel S. Dinny, who served as com­mand­ing of­fi­cer at Pan­gong Tso be­tween 2015 and 2017.</p>
    <p>“The tem­per­a­ture goes down to sub-zero. The oxy­gen level is at 60 per cent. Fa­tigue in­creases man­i­fold. You get chilblains if a body part is ex­posed for even a short du­ra­tion,” said Col Dinny.</p>
    <p>“There is def­i­nitely a de­crease in ac­tiv­i­ties in win­ter, whether in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment like build­ing roads or pa­trols. It is quite chal­leng­ing. It will test the limit of lo­gis­tic backup, sus­te­nance and sur­viv­abil­ity of peo­ple and equip­ment. It won’t be easy. But there is a job to be done, we will do it.”</p>
    <p>Videos re­leased on Sunday show In­dian Army tanks and ar­moured per­son­nel car­ri­ers in for­ward lo­ca­tions in eastern Ladakh. The tanks can re­port­edly op­er­ate at tem­per­a­tures as low as mi­nus 40 deg C.</p>
    <p>“Even in the best of con­di­tions, it is dif­fi­cult to func­tion (at Pan­gong Tso). When you add tem­per­a­ture and wind con­di­tions created by the on­set of win­ter, it be­comes really dif­fi­cult to sur­vive, and for troops to spend the whole win­ter there is a challenge by any stan­dards,” said jour­nal­ist and for­mer In­dian Army of­fi­cer Ajai Shukla.</p>
    <p>While In­dia has ex­pe­ri­ence in high-al­ti­tude war­fare, it is known to come at a high cost. At Si­achen Glacier, the high­est bat­tle­field be­tween In­dia and Pak­istan where the win­ter tem­per­a­tures can drop to mi­nus 70 deg C, the ad­verse con­di­tions have killed hundreds of sol­diers, mostly from hy­pother­mia, avalanches and frost­bite than ac­tual fight­ing.</p>
    <p>“I think phys­i­cally, from the point of view of ex­pe­ri­ence, In­dian sol­diers are bet­ter geared for the prospect of spend­ing win­ter out there. The key is to put in place the in­fra­struc­ture re­quired to do so, like snow shel­ters, that is more dif­fi­cult from the In­dian side.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese have bet­ter roads and bet­ter ac­cess. So it evens out,” said Mr Shukla.</p>
    <p>He noted that In­dia had up­graded in­fra­struc­ture ex­po­nen­tially since the stand­off with China started nearly five months ago.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions along the In­dia-China border, which has largely re­mained peace­ful, spiked in June after sol­diers on both sides were killed in a clash in Ladakh’s Gal­wan Val­ley.</p>
    <p>Last month, In­dian troops stopped their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts from oc­cu­py­ing van­tage po­si­tions on the south­ern bank of the lake, after they were pre­vented by Chi­nese troops from pa­trolling ar­eas on the north­ern bank that had been ac­ces­si­ble ear­lier.</p>
    <p>A po­ten­tial trig­ger for the border ten­sions is said to stem from In­dia’s moves to boost in­fra­struc­ture along the border and last year’s de­ci­sion to carve out the union ter­ri­tory of Ladakh from Jammu and Kash­mir.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said that there was no ques­tion of ei­ther side giv­ing up van­tage points in spite of the ad­verse weather con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“Sol­diers will re­main un­less there is a break­through in the talks...” said re­tired lieu­tenant-gen­eral D. S. Hooda.</p>
