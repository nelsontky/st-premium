    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has dis­rupted the aca­demic rou­tines and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties of many chil­dren and youth, and has had a neg­a­tive im­pact on their men­tal health.</p>
    <p>That is why strength­en­ing men­tal health re­silience is all the more im­por­tant dur­ing this pe­riod, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She added that Sin­ga­pore has to step up ef­forts to pro­tect the men­tal health of chil­dren here early.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent was speak­ing at the vir­tual open­ing cer­e­mony of the 24th World Congress of the In­ter­na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion for Child and Ado­les­cent Psy­chi­a­try and Al­lied Pro­fes­sions, where she out­lined sev­eral strate­gies the Repub­lic has adopted to bol­ster men­tal health sup­port for its young.</p>
    <p>Among other things, they in­volve col­lab­o­ra­tion with dif­fer­ent stake­hold­ers, pro­mot­ing men­tal health lit­er­acy in chil­dren and youth, and im­prov­ing ac­cess to men­tal health re­sources.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing youth sui­cide as a par­tic­u­lar grow­ing con­cern, Madam Hal­imah said dif­fer­ent stake­hold­ers such as hos­pi­tals, schools and com­mu­nity part­ners have stepped up ef­forts to work to­gether to sup­port those at risk of sui­cide.</p>
    <p>“We must tackle it by ad­dress­ing the po­ten­tial causes, es­pe­cially when men­tal health con­di­tions like anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion may in­ten­sify the prob­lem,” she said.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said that be­sides plac­ing great em­pha­sis on pre­ven­tive care and fo­cus­ing in­ter­ven­tion up­stream, Sin­ga­pore has also made ef­forts to im­prove pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion and men­tal health lit­er­acy in chil­dren and youth.</p>
    <p>“It is es­sen­tial to equip chil­dren with knowl­edge of com­mon men­tal health con­di­tions and ways to man­age them, as well as de­velop in them em­pa­thy and care to­wards per­sons with men­tal health con­di­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>This is why men­tal health ed­u­ca­tion will be in­cluded in a re­vised cur­ricu­lum to be pro­gres­sively im­ple­mented from next year, and all schools here will es­tab­lish peer sup­port struc­tures by 2022 to strengthen cur­rent peer sup­port ef­forts, she added.</p>
    <p>On­line ini­tia­tives have also been rolled out to en­hance young peo­ple’s ac­cess to men­tal health re­sources.</p>
    <p>These in­clude mind­line.sg, an on­line por­tal with men­tal health re­sources that can also as­sess users’ emo­tional well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said the Repub­lic adopts a whole-of-so­ci­ety ap­proach in build­ing a safety net for those liv­ing with men­tal health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes train­ing schools and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to iden­tify and man­age at-risk chil­dren with se­vere emo­tional and be­havioural prob­lems, of­fer­ing free men­tal health checks as well as rolling out co­or­di­nated men­tal health and so­cial sup­port ser­vices for at-risk youth.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many peo­ple with men­tal health con­di­tions do not seek treat­ment in a timely man­ner, noted Madam Hal­imah.</p>
    <p>The 2016 Sin­ga­pore Men­tal Health Study found that more than three-quar­ters of those liv­ing with men­tal health con­di­tions did not seek treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“The de­lay in treat­ment for ob­ses­sive com­pul­sive dis­or­der was 11 years; four years for bipo­lar dis­or­der and al­co­hol abuse; and two years for anx­i­ety dis­or­der,” she said.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous stud­ies have shown that so­cial stigma and a lack of knowl­edge about men­tal dis­or­ders are two com­mon rea­sons for de­lay­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said: “Men­tal health con­di­tions that are left un­treated will im­pair chil­dren’s devel­op­ment and un­der­mine their abil­ity to achieve their fullest po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>“It is there­fore im­por­tant that we step up ef­forts to pro­tect the men­tal health of our chil­dren early.”</p>
    <p>The vir­tual congress will run un­til to­mor­row, with dis­cus­sions on the im­por­tance of early in­ter­ven­tion in the child and ado­les­cent stages for bet­ter men­tal health over a life­time.</p>
    <p>DEVEL­OP­ING EM­PA­THY</p>
    <p>It is es­sen­tial to equip chil­dren with knowl­edge of com­mon men­tal health con­di­tions and ways to man­age them, as well as de­velop in them em­pa­thy and care to­wards per­sons with men­tal health con­di­tions.</p>
