    </section>

    <p>Many cou­ples dis­play their af­fec­tion by wear­ing iden­ti­cal or co­or­di­nated out­fits, but K-pop cou­ple Hyuna and Dawn have taken it to an­other level by wear­ing match­ing leotards.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Hyuna, 28, posted on In­sta­gram two pho­tos of her and Dawn in iden­ti­cal leotards, de­scrib­ing them as newly bought and warm.</p>
    <p>Some fans com­mented that they looked cute in the leotards, while other fans asked Hyuna how she had con­vinced Dawn to wear his.</p>
    <p>Dawn, 26, seemed un­per­turbed and also shared the two pho­tos on his In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Hyuna, whose full name is Kim Hyun-ah, fa­mously ap­peared in the mu­sic video for singer Psy’s 2012 world­wide hit Gang­nam Style.</p>
    <p>She was in the news in Au­gust af­ter she de­layed the launch of her sin­gle, Good Girl, due to faint­ing spells.</p>
    <p>Hyuna, who made her de­but with girl group Won­der Girls in 2007 and is a for­mer mem­ber of girl group 4Minute, was also in­volved in the project group Triple H with Dawn and Hui from the boy group Pen­tagon.</p>
    <p>Hyuna and Dawn left their la­bel Cube En­ter­tain­ment in 2018 and joined the la­bel P Na­tion, founded by Psy, last year af­ter they went pub­lic with their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
