    <p>In­done­sia’s Ed­u­ca­tion and Cul­ture Min­is­ter Nadiem Makarim said the coron­avirus has sent gov­ern­ments around the world into “shock ther­apy” to close the dig­i­tal di­vide in the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor as coun­tries went into lock­down.</p>
    <p>“When Covid hit, we sud­denly have to learn from home, and work from home. Sud­denly gov­ern­ments, or­gan­i­sa­tions, com­pa­nies were thrown at the fore­front of this dig­i­tal in­equal­ity prob­lem,” he said yes­ter­day, not­ing this in­cluded un­even ac­cess to the In­ter­net and sta­ble elec­tric­ity.</p>
    <p>“And every­one got to work, every­one ral­lied around the con­cept of dig­i­tal ac­cess be­ing a fun­da­men­tal hu­man right. That is pre­cious.”</p>
    <p>Mr Nadiem was distin­guished guest speaker at this year’s fourday Sin­ga­pore Sum­mit, which gath­ered busi­ness and thought lead­ers to dis­cuss global trends. His di­a­logue on the topic Learn­ing from Covid-19: Redefin­ing the Fu­ture of Ed­u­ca­tion brought to a close the an­nual sum­mit, which was held vir­tu­ally this year due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the ses­sion mod­er­ated by Pro­fes­sor Danny Quah, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, Mr Nadiem dis­cussed the tech­no­log­i­cal dis­rup­tions and chal­lenges in the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old, the youngest min­is­ter in Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s Cabi­net, was co-founder of Go­jek, one of South-east Asia’s big­gest start-ups which op­er­ates a multi-ser­vice app from mo­tor­cy­cle ride-hail­ing to dig­i­tal pay­ment.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy of 270 mil­lion peo­ple, con­tin­ues to grap­ple with the pan­demic, with 232,628 cases and 9,222 deaths as of yes­ter­day. A city­wide par­tial lock­down was reim­posed in Jakarta last week.</p>
    <p>Like else­where in the world, the health cri­sis has forced schools to shut in In­done­sia and stu­dents to adopt re­mote on­line learn­ing at home. Mr Nadiem said In­done­sia was al­ready fac­ing a “gar­gan­tuan task” in pro­vid­ing qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion across the re­gions with mas­sive vari­a­tions in cul­ture, lan­guage, ge­o­graph­i­cal bound­aries and in­fra­struc­ture devel­op­ment, and the health cri­sis had only widened the in­equal­ity gap.</p>
    <p>But tech­nol­ogy aside, the big­gest fac­tor that can level the play­ing field be­tween the haves and havenots in the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor is get­ting good teach­ers to less de­vel­oped re­gions. “As great as tech­nol­ogy is, noth­ing re­places a fan­tas­tic prin­ci­pal that you send to the is­lands of Maluku or Pa­pua, and they just au­tonomously cre­ate re­forms there in nu­mer­acy, lit­er­acy, crit­i­cal think­ing and have a love of men­tor­ing other teach­ers,” he said, re­fer­ring to two re­mote is­lands in eastern In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>In his part­ing ad­vice to stu­dents, he said they should be con­scious of a growth mind­set and not wait for the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem to change. Rather, they should seek the knowledge and rel­e­vant skills needed to chart their ca­reer path.</p>
    <p>He also said that in­dus­tries change rapidly and the young should take ca­reer ad­vice from peers five to seven years older than them, and not from their par­ents.</p>
    <p>“A lot of ad­vice from par­ents is of­ten out­dated by the time (you) en­ter the work­force,” he said. “Learn your val­ues from your par­ents but be mind­ful of tak­ing your ca­reer ad­vice from them.”</p>
