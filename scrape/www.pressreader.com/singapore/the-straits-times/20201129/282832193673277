    <p>Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer is de­lighted that limited num­bers of fans will soon be back in Premier League sta­di­ums, even if his club’s sup­port­ers are not among them.</p>
    <p>Fans have been shut out of toplevel matches in Eng­land since March but a re­lax­ation of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions will al­low them back into grounds in some parts of Eng­land from next week.</p>
    <p>Lon­don and Liver­pool are among the ar­eas to have been placed into the Tier-2 cat­e­gory based on in­fec­tion rates, mean­ing up to 2,000 fans will be able to at­tend matches. But clubs based in Tier-3 ar­eas, such as Manch­ester and Birm­ing­ham, are still not al­lowed to open their gates.</p>
    <p>United’s visit to West Ham next Satur­day will be the first Premier League game that fans can at­tend for eight months.</p>
    <p>“I’m very pleased that we’re mak­ing progress and we can let the fans in grad­u­ally,” Sol­sk­jaer said ahead of today’s trip to Southamp­ton, which is in Tier 2.</p>
    <p>“We can’t wait to see our own fans at Old Traf­ford and we know how long they’ve been wait­ing to be there to watch the games live.</p>
    <p>“This is a step in the right di­rec­tion and even though they are fans for the other team, they are still cre­at­ing an at­mos­phere in the game.”</p>
    <p>United travel to high-fly­ing Southamp­ton hop­ing to build on a run of three straight wins. But the Saints are un­beaten in seven league games and sit four points ahead of United (13) in the stand­ings.</p>
    <p>“If you look over the last 13 or 14 games they’re one of the top teams so they’ve made great im­prove­ments,” said Sol­sk­jaer. “We know how dif­fi­cult it is.”</p>
    <p>Mid­field­ers Paul Pogba and Scott Mc­Tom­i­nay look set to miss out through in­jury, but Mar­cus Rash­ford, Vic­tor Lin­de­lof and Aaron Wan-Bis­saka have re­cov­ered from knocks and are ex­pected to start.</p>
