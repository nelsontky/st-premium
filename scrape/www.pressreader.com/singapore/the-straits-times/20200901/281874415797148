    <p>NEW YORK • US cases of the coro­n­avirus have sur­passed six mil­lion as many states in the Mid­west re­ported in­creas­ing in­fec­tions, a Reuters tally on Sun­day showed.</p>
    <p>Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Min­nesota have re­cently re­ported record one-day in­creases in new cases, while Mon­tana and Idaho are see­ing record num­bers of hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients. Na­tion­ally, met­rics on new cases, deaths, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and the pos­i­tiv­ity rates of tests are all de­clin­ing, but there are emerg­ing hot spots in the Mid­west.</p>
    <p>Many of the new cases in Iowa are in the coun­ties that are home to the Univer­sity of Iowa and Iowa State Univer­sity, which are hold­ing some in-per­son classes. Col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties around the coun­try have seen out­breaks af­ter stu­dents re­turned to cam­pus, forc­ing some to switch to on­line-only learn­ing.</p>
    <p>New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said on Sun­day that his state was send­ing a “Swat team” to a State Univer­sity of New York (SUNY) cam­pus in Oneonta, in up­state New York, to con­tain a Covid-19 out­break. Au­tumn classes, which started last week at the col­lege, were sus­pended for two weeks af­ter more than 100 peo­ple tested pos­i­tive for the virus, SUNY chan­cel­lor Jim Mala­tras said.</p>
    <p>“We have had re­ports of sev­eral large par­ties of our stu­dents at Oneonta last week and, un­for­tu­nately, be­cause of those larger gath­er­ings, there were sev­eral stu­dents who were symp­to­matic of Covid,” Mr Mala­tras said.</p>
    <p>Across the Mid­west, in­fec­tions have also risen af­ter an an­nual mo­tor­cy­cle rally in Stur­gis, South Dakota, drew more than 365,000 peo­ple from across the coun­try from Aug 7 to 16. The South Dakota health de­part­ment said 88 cases have been traced to the rally.</p>
    <p>More than eight months into the pan­demic, the United States con­tin­ues to strug­gle with test­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple tested has fallen in re­cent weeks. Many health of­fi­cials and at least 33 states have re­jected the new Covid-19 test­ing guid­ance is­sued by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion last week that said those ex­posed to the virus but not show­ing any symp­toms may not need test­ing.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health of­fi­cials be­lieve the US needs to test more fre­quently to find asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers in or­der to slow the spread of the disease.</p>
    <p>While the US has the most num­ber of recorded in­fec­tions in the world, it ranks 10th based on cases per capita, with Brazil, Peru and Chile hav­ing higher rates of in­fec­tion, ac­cord­ing to the Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>The US also has the most deaths in the world at over 187,000 but ranks 11th for deaths per capita, ex­ceeded by coun­tries such as Swe­den, Brazil, Italy, Chile, Spain and the United King­dom.</p>
