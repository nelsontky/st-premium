    <p>Such was Tiger Woods’ frus­tra­tion that he de­clined to talk to the me­dia on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion had gone into this week’s Zozo Cham­pi­onship with high ex­pec­ta­tions, with some an­a­lysts pre­dict­ing he would break out of a tie with Sam Snead to claim a record 83rd PGA Tour ti­tle on a course he loves.</p>
    <p>The event at Sher­wood Coun­try Club in Thou­sand Oaks, Cal­i­for­nia, is also likely to be his fi­nal warm-up be­fore next month’s Masters ti­tle de­fence, so Woods had aimed to gain some mo­men­tum ahead of the third Ma­jor of the year.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the for­mer world No. 1’s hopes of re­tain­ing his Zozo ti­tle – he won the in­au­gu­ral edi­tion in Ja­pan last Oc­to­ber – went up in smoke af­ter a dis­as­trous open­ing four-over 76. It left him tied for se­cond-last in a field of 77 play­ers at the no-cut event.</p>
    <p>His one bright spot came when he drained an 87-foot putt on the par­four 14th hole that elicited a rare smile from the Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>But it was his joint-worst PGA show­ing on par-five holes in any round, go­ing three-over with a birdie, two bo­geys and a dou­ble bo­gey.</p>
    <p>It was a shock as it came on a course that hosted his Hero World Chal­lenge char­ity event for 13 years un­til 2013. Yet Woods was not the only big-name star to strug­gle.</p>
    <p>Four-time Ma­jor win­ner Rory McIl­roy snapped his club in anger on his way to a dis­ap­point­ing 73, which in­cluded four bo­geys and two dou­ble bo­geys.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers were not quite as flus­tered as the duo.</p>
    <p>Se­bas­tian Munoz had a roller­coaster round, but fin­ished with a 64 to emerge as the first-round leader.</p>
    <p>The Colom­bian, whose lone PGA vic­tory came last year at Jack­son,</p>
    <p>CLEAR MIND</p>
    <p>Mis­sis­sippi, had two ea­gles, eight birdies, five pars, two bo­geys and a dou­ble bo­gey, but claimed he was al­ways in con­trol.</p>
    <p>“I’ve be­come bet­ter with man­ag­ing crazy ups and downs,” the 27-year-old said. “I just get out of the way. At first I was like what should I do? Should I be more calm? Should I at­tack more?</p>
    <p>“I just stopped try­ing to play any­thing and just keep play­ing golf. It’s just one of those days. It hap­pens.</p>
    <p>“I just fo­cused on mak­ing the best swing I could and I started four yards left, started cut­ting nicely to­wards the pin.</p>
    <p>“Once you see the guys throw the touch­down sign, it’s good.”</p>
    <p>He was one stroke ahead of world No. 9 Tyrrell Hat­ton and thir­dranked Justin Thomas, who both shared se­cond on 65.</p>
    <p>De­spite world No. 1 Dustin John­son and 15th-ranked Adam Scott be­ing side­lined due to pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests, and the late with­drawal of last year’s US Open win­ner Gary Wood­land due to a back in­jury, the event still boasts a strong line-up.</p>
    <p>World No. 2 Jon Rahm (68), 25thranked Justin Rose (67) and PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner Collin Morikawa (71) all got off to de­cent open­ing rounds.</p>
    <p>The Zozo Cham­pi­onship, orig­i­nally part of the PGA Tour’s Asian swing, is be­ing played in Cal­i­for­nia in­stead of Ja­pan be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but the tour­na­ment is ex­pected to re­turn to its host coun­try next year.</p>
    <p>I’ve be­come bet­ter with man­ag­ing crazy ups and downs. I just get out of the way... I just stopped try­ing to play any­thing and just keep play­ing golf.</p>
