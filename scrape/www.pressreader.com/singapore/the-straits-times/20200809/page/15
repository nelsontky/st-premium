        | | The Sunday Times A15 Sunday, August 9, 2020 National Day Parade Sole Red Lions woman will land in Sengkang with a different set of challenges, with the landing set at heartland grass fields instead of the floating platform at Marina Bay or the Padang. With high-rise buildings and expressway­s in the vicinity, the Red Lions need to be very precise about where they drop.
The free-fall height is half that of the usual NDP jump, which means that unlike other parade performanc­es, the Red Lions will not get into their iconic ring formation and will deploy their parachutes as soon as three seconds after they jump from the aircraft, 2WO Ng said.
Preparatio­ns for this year’s NDP were also slightly delayed, with jump rehearsals on-site starting only last month, a month later than usual. But the Red Lions used the parachute flight simulator to hone their techniques, and conducted rehearsals at the airbase, she added.
While this year’s landing will not be surrounded by thousands of spectators, it is no less spectacula­r than the jumps at Marina Bay or the Padang, 2WO Ng said, thanks to the support of residents in the area. The Sengkang neighbourh­ood is a familiar one for her, as she lives with her mother in Hougang.
“As we land, they are cheering for us; we can see them waving from their windows and balconies, and it is very heart-warming.” Choo Yun Ting Singapore’s first and only woman member of the Red Lions, Second Warrant Officer Shirley Ng, will be part of this year’s crew of parachutis­ts landing in the heartland.
Two teams of the Red Lions – a crowd favourite at every National Day Parade (NDP) – will be making a 1,524m free-fall from a Republic of Singapore Air Force C-130 Hercules aircraft onto grass fields near Sengkang General Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.
2WO Ng, 42, a regular, has more than 530 jumps under her belt. She made her first parade appearance as a Red Lion in 2014 when the NDP was held at The Float@Marina Bay, and was also part of the 2013 team whose performanc­e was thwarted by poor weather.
But while she is the only rose among the thorns in the Red Lions team, there are other women in her unit who are actively doing parachute jumps, she said. “I really hope to see them become part of the team in the next few years.”
In the six years since her last NDP involvemen­t, 2WO Ng has been focusing on her other commitment­s as a rigger in supporting the commando formation. She is glad to have been chosen to be part of the team this year, and will make the landing near Sengkang General Hospital in a tribute to the frontline workers in Singapore’s fight against Covid-19.
This year’s performanc­e comes yuntingc@sph.com.sg Evening show optimised for a home audience ate of Temasek Polytechni­c, he is known for painting extraordin­ary stories of ordinary people on screen.
His works, such as 15 (2002) and 881 (2007), have drawn acclaim. In 2016, he won the Best Asian Short Film prize at the Sapporo Internatio­nal Short Film Festival. The win was for Bunga Sayang, a story of a young boy who strikes up a friendship with an old Malay neighbour, in the award-winning film anthology 7 Letters (2015).
For this year’s NDP show, Mr Tan and his team put together six acts depicting the challenges facing Singapore and how the country is emerging from crisis, before ending off with a message of solidarity and hope for the future.
Acknowledg­ing the challenges of putting together a show while ensuring the safety of those involved, Mr Tan said: “When Covid-19 hit us and our team decided to change our concept for NDP, it was painful. We had mapped out performanc­es with thousands of people, costumes all done up and ready.
“But as I look back, I don’t have the right to feel pain. There are many other Singaporea­ns who feel pain. We see this as an opportunit­y for them to echo their sentiments and incorporat­e that in the show. NDP unifies people, but it also heals people.” Malavika Menon Though it had long been a dream of local film-maker and director Royston Tan to direct the National Day Parade show, he never expected to be staging one in the midst of a pandemic.
The 43-year-old creative director of the NDP 2020 evening show and his team had begun preparatio­ns as early as August last year.
By February, the team had a concrete concept in place, but as Covid-19 took hold, they realised the original concept would not be relevant to Singaporea­ns in the current crisis.
The show was completely revamped and optimised for a home audience, and features intimate, small indoor performanc­es and films paying tribute to everyday heroes in Singapore.
Mr Tan hopes the show will unite and encourage a nation that has been through a lot this year. He said: “We had hoped to capture the very real and relatable experience­s of Singaporea­ns this year.
“2020 has not been rosy, but amidst the struggle, there have been incredible acts of kindness, resilience and unity, which we want to share with the rest of Singapore.”
Held at The Star Performing Arts Centre today, the show will be broadcast live from 7pm.
As multimedia director and theme song music video director for last year’s NDP show, Mr Tan had a firm handle on what could work this year.
A visual communicat­ions gradu- mmala@sph.com.sg Bringing mobile column to the heartland cally happens only once every four or five years, when the NDP is held at the Padang. “We wanted to bring the mobile column back to the heartland, so people can wave to it from where they are,” said LTC Low, 38, who chairs this year’s mobile column committee.
The event has been scaled down and simplified, with just 66 assets on display which will go directly to the heartland instead of first executing a drive-past at the Padang.
Last year’s participan­ts in the mobile column had about twice as much time to prepare. But this year’s five routes will cover a record distance of 200km as the vehicles and assets trundle their way into more neighbourh­oods than before.
LTC Low said the planning committee worked with various agencies to understand the road terrain and work out safe and viable routes, while maximising the number of neighbourh­oods visited.
Although much of the planning could be done remotely through video-conferenci­ng, in-person training could only begin when the circuit breaker was lifted in June. The mobile column this year differs from last year’s in that it will not be at the Padang. Instead, the various military assets will depart from camps around Singapore and go directly into the heartland.
This also meant it was possible to put the show together over just six or seven sessions, conducted on weekends over two months.
Training has been complicate­d by the fact that safe distancing measures continue to be in place.
LTC Low said no effort has been spared to ensure safety. Briefings which would normally be done with a large group had to be done many times with smaller groups.
The effort will be worth it, he added. “The NDP mobile column is a display of our nation’s strength and unity. I really think these are the characteri­stics of Singapore and Singaporea­ns that have gotten us through the tough times and turmoil over the last 55 years,” he said.
“Now with Covid-19, all the more we want to uplift people’s spirits and hold on to these values.” Rei Kurohi Planning for this year’s National Day Parade (NDP) began in earnest last September, almost immediatel­y after NDP 2019, Lieutenant­Colonel Low Youwen recalls.
But as the Covid-19 situation began to worsen, it became apparent that a traditiona­l parade would not be possible this year. By April, the organisers had significan­tly revised the initial plans, he said.
While many things were cut, one big item was added. For the second year in a row, the organisers decided to showcase a mobile column – a military drive-past that typi- rei@sph.com.sg PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
