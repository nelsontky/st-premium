    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • This year’s edi­tion of Asia’s sec­ond-tier AFC Cup club com­pe­ti­tion has been can­celled amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the con­ti­nent’s foot­ball gov­ern­ing body con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion, in­volv­ing teams from more mi­nor na­tions in Asia, in­clud­ing Singapore Pre­mier League out­fits Tampines Rovers and Hougang United, had been sus­pended since March due to the global health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>It was orig­i­nally sched­uled to re­sume this month in cen­tralised venues, but with the sit­u­a­tion still too volatile, the Asian Foot­ball Con­fed­er­a­tion (AFC) de­cided to ac­ti­vate its force ma­jeure clause.</p>
    <p>AFC pres­i­dent Sheikh Sal­man Ebrahim al-Khalifa said: These are tough times for ev­ery­one con­nected with foot­ball – and sport.”</p>
    <p>While Tampines, who were lead­ing Group H on seven points, two ahead of sec­ond-placed Kaya FC, rued the missed op­por­tu­nity to ad­vance to the next stage, the club said it un­der­stood the rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Coach Gavin Lee added: “It’s a unique po­si­tion we are in now. There are more im­por­tant things than foot­ball. It’s not time for us to cry about it... We started the (Cup) well and we were tar­get­ing to qual­ify out of the groups – some­thing we came close to the sea­son be­fore – but... we want to move on and look at what we have to play for.”</p>
    <p>Un­like Tampines, Hougang were not in an ad­van­ta­geous po­si­tion, on three points and trail­ing Group F joint-lead­ers Ho Chi Minh City and Yan­gon United by four when play was halted. The club, how­ever, still had a chance to progress on their tour­na­ment de­but.</p>
    <p>Coach Cle­ment Teo is now train­ing his sights on the pos­si­ble restart of the SPL, which could be later this month, six months af­ter it was first put on ice. They fin­ished third in the SPL last year.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally, we’re dis­ap­pointed be­cause this is the first time par­tic­i­pat­ing in the com­pe­ti­tion in the club’s his­tory,” he said. “We felt that there was an op­por­tu­nity to pro­ceed to the sec­ond round.</p>
    <p>“But... there’s only so much we can do. With this, we can fo­cus on one sin­gle ob­jec­tive, and that is to play in the league and try to do bet­ter than we did last sea­son.”</p>
