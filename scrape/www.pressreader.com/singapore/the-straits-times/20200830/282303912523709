    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial?</p>
    <p>This is the grande dame of Sin­ga­pore that dates back to 1887, where roy­alty and celebri­ties have rested their weary heads.</p>
    <p>But de­spite its ad­vanced age, there are no is­sues with creaky floor­boards or noisy pipes. In fact, it is ar­guably one of the new­est ho­tels here, hav­ing re­opened only last year af­ter an ex­ten­sive three-year re­fur­bish­ment.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing in the all-suites ac­com­mo­da­tion is spank­ing new, from the fur­ni­ture to the high-tech room con­trols. But an old-world charm re­mains, both in the colo­nial ar­chi­tec­ture and his­toric arte­facts that in­clude a grand­fa­ther clock be­lieved to pre­date the ho­tel. It still chimes ev­ery hour from the lobby.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>Guests are greeted at the en­trance by the ho­tel’s iconic Sikh door­men, who are so much a part of the ho­tel their im­age is printed on gift shop sou­venirs.</p>
    <p>The suites are de­signed in a mix of old and new. The switches, for ex­am­ple, come with old-fash­ioned knobs. Flick­ing one up sends the cur­tains rolling up.</p>
    <p>I love the faux leather trunk in the sit­ting room, which I imag­ine was used by rich trav­ellers on ocean lin­ers in the past. It opens into an awe­some drinks cabi­net you wish you could take home – if not for the fact that a hefty sum will no doubt be slapped onto your room bill.</p>
    <p>What about the restau­rants?</p>
    <p>Food­ies are spoilt for choice with four in-house restau­rants.</p>
    <p>For din­ner, pam­per your­self at La Dame de Pic, where chef An­neSo­phie Pic’s el­e­gant French cui­sine sets the mood for a night of wine and roses.</p>
    <p>Then lunch the next day on dim sum and dishes from dif­fer­ent Chi­nese re­gions at yi by Jereme Le­ung. But make sure you leave enough room for Butcher’s Block in the evening be­cause you do not want to miss its ex­cel­lent bone-in steaks. And you shouldn’t skip the Iberico pork sando ei­ther.</p>
    <p>If you can squeeze it in, go for lunch at Tif­fin Room be­fore you check out. Its tiger prawn ke­bab is the bomb and the cur­ries are not to be sneezed at ei­ther.</p>
    <p>BBR by Alain Du­casse is still closed, and so are the Long Bar and Writ­ers Bar. But you get to claim your com­pli­men­tary Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Sling at the Grand Lobby at tea time or dur­ing happy hour at the Raf­fles Court­yard, along with free peanuts.</p>
    <p>How’s the break­fast?</p>
    <p>You or­der as much as you want from a menu that reels off Western items, such as eggs, waf­fles and pan­cakes, plus Asian favourites like nasi le­mak and mee goreng.</p>
    <p>Def­i­nitely get the con­gee. It comes with a range of condi­ments like fer­mented bean­curd, pick­led turnip and a whole crispy dough frit­ter.</p>
    <p>You can en­joy the meal in the Tif­fin Room or the Grand Lobby. If the weather is good, go al­fresco in the Palm Gar­den be­side an an­tique cast-iron foun­tain that was orig­i­nally from the Telok Ayer Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Please tell us there is a spa.</p>
    <p>The Raf­fles Spa re­opened early this year and now op­er­ates from Wed­nes­days to Sun­days.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated in the Raf­fles Ar­cade fac­ing North Bridge Road, it boasts spa­cious treat­ment rooms with at­tached shower and locker fa­cil­i­ties. So you can change and wash up be­fore go­ing back to your suite.</p>
    <p>I wouldn’t sug­gest ven­tur­ing there in your bathrobe be­cause the gates through the court­yards are now locked and you have to tra­verse a pub­lic area.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Book the guided his­tory tour of the ho­tel and be re­galed with tales of the es­caped cir­cus tiger that wan­dered into the base­ment of The Bar and Bil­liard Room (now BBR) and the tra­di­tion of Noel Cow­ard’s I’ll See You Again (1929) be­ing played in the lobby at 8pm daily with­out fail.</p>
    <p>You’ll also walk down a gallery lined with pho­tos of fa­mous per­son­al­i­ties who have vis­ited the ho­tel, in­clud­ing Queen El­iz­a­beth II and ac­tress El­iz­a­beth Tay­lor as well as fa­mous au­thors like Rud­yard Ki­pling, Som­er­set Maugham, Joseph Con­rad and Cow­ard. Among the lat­est pho­tos is one of the Sin­ga­pore cast of Crazy Rich Asians (2018). Some scenes were filmed there.</p>
    <p>The tour is usu­ally over-sub­scribed but fret not. You can come back for it days or weeks af­ter you check out.</p>
    <p>Why sleep in when you can get an early start to the day, right?</p>
    <p>Work up an ap­petite for break­fast with a swim or by sweat­ing it out at the gym. You will need it to pack in</p>
    <p>all that food.</p>
    <p>The pool is on the rooftop of the main build­ing and if you are not a ho­tel guest, you never get to see it. It is good for laps and boasts views of a colo­nial-style bar set against the mod­ern Raf­fles City.</p>
    <p>Over at the gym, the range of gleam­ing Techn­o­gym equip­ment is com­pre­hen­sive enough to give you a good work­out.</p>
    <p>Ad­vanced book­ing is re­quired for both the pool and gym, but chances are few peo­ple will be fight­ing with you for a spot be­fore 9am.</p>
    <p>Verdict: Bliss or miss?</p>
    <p>The suite is so spa­cious and com­fort­able that I can hap­pily laze in it the whole day – ex­cept that it would be a waste not to ex­plore the parts of the build­ing that are not open to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>I love the ex­pan­sive black-and­white bath­room too, which comes with his and hers sinks.</p>
    <p>To min­imise con­tact, check-out is done re­motely. You just need to call the but­ler on the phone and leave the key on the ta­ble be­fore you leave.</p>
    <p>There is a care pack thought­fully placed in the suite con­tain­ing masks, sani­tiser and anti-bac­te­rial wipes inside a re­us­able cloth pouch.</p>
    <p>You take that home with you, to­gether with the mem­ory of a grand ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>HOT TIP</p>
    <p>Book your stay from Wed­nes­days to Sun­days, be­cause Raf­fles Spa, Butcher’s Block and La Dame de Pic are closed on Mon­days and Tues­days.</p>
