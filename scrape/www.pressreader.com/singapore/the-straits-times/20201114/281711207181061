    <p>NEW YORK • Western politi­cians have faulted China for ini­tial de­lays in pro­vid­ing in­for­ma­tion as the coro­n­avirus spread around the world. Now, as Bei­jing de­vel­ops a vac­cine, the need for trans­parency is prov­ing essen­tial to win back trust.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can drug­maker Pfizer and Ger­man biotech­nol­ogy firm BioNTech an­nounced this week that its vac­cine ap­pears more than 90 per cent ef­fec­tive in stop­ping Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“As China con­tin­ues to push its own vac­cines through the fi­nal stage of clin­i­cal trial in the midst of Pfizer’s an­nounce­ment, the need for Bei­jing to ad­dress pub­lic per­cep­tion about its vac­cine safety is­sues is more press­ing now than ever,” said Ms Xiao­qing Lu Boyn­ton, a con­sul­tant at Al­bright Stone­bridge Group who fo­cuses on health care and life sci­ences.</p>
    <p>For China, the stakes in de­vel­op­ing a suc­cess­ful vac­cine are high af­ter a year that saw the out­break of the coro­n­avirus – first de­tected in Wuhan – fur­ther roil re­la­tions with the United States, Europe, In­dia and Aus­tralia. While Bei­jing quickly got the virus un­der con­trol and sought to dis­trib­ute aid to other coun­tries, com­plaints fol­lowed about faulty ma­te­ri­als and strings at­tached.</p>
    <p>The race to de­velop a vac­cine has since be­come a way for China to show the world its tech­no­log­i­cal su­pe­ri­or­ity as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion urges coun­tries around the globe to avoid Chi­nese com­pa­nies for 5G net­works, com­puter chips and big in­fras­truc­ture projects.</p>
    <p>Dis­tribut­ing it widely would also help China re­gain some lost soft power: Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has promised vac­cines de­vel­oped by China will be a global “pub­lic good”, and he joined a World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion-backed ef­fort to in­oc­u­late ev­ery­one against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The “prob­lem for me is global pub­lic good or China pub­lic good – it’s two dif­fer­ent no­tions,” said Mr Ni­co­las Cha­puis, the Euro­pean Union’s Am­bas­sador to China. While he praised China’s de­ci­sion to join the WHO-backed vac­cine pro­gramme, he said many ques­tions re­main on dis­tri­bu­tion, price and in­ter­na­tional cer­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“To be cer­ti­fied, sam­ples have to be given,” he said. “Sam­ples have not been given.”</p>
    <p>China’s set­back in Brazil – which re­versed its de­ci­sion on Wed­nes­day to al­low clin­i­cal tri­als of a Chi­nese-de­vel­oped Covid-19 vac­cine to re­sume, two days af­ter sus­pend­ing them – com­bined with Pfizer’s break­through “put China’s vac­cine diplo­macy in jeop­ardy”, said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Yong­wook Ryu at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The is­sue is the lack of trans­parency,” he said. “So the right thing for the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment to do is to make its trial re­sults and re­lated in­for­ma­tion pub­lic, so that ex­perts can scru­ti­nise them.”</p>
    <p>China has al­ready ad­min­is­tered its vac­cine, in­clud­ing the one from Si­no­vac Biotech, to hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple un­der an ex­pan­sive emer­gency use pro­gramme. But none of the Chi­nese front run­ners has pub­lished any pre­lim­i­nary data from phase three tri­als as Pfizer has done. Brazil’s health reg­u­la­tor is send­ing a mis­sion to China this month to in­spect fa­cil­i­ties of some com­pa­nies in­volved in vac­cine pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, pub­lic anger with China is at the high­est in re­cent mem­ory fol­low­ing a deadly bor­der stand­off. “Co­op­er­a­tion will be dif­fi­cult given cur­rent lev­els of trust,” said Mr Biren Nanda, a for­mer In­dian am­bas­sador who spent a decade in China. “When not only In­dia but even other na­tions can’t seem to trust China with their work on our tele­com sys­tems and elec­tron­ics, it would be a tall or­der to ex­pect trust in a Chi­nese vac­cine.”</p>
