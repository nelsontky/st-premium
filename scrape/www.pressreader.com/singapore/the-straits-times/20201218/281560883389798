    <p>There are some peo­ple who should wait to re­ceive a Covid-19 vac­cine, in­clud­ing those with a history of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions, said ex­perts yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Se­ri­ous al­ler­gies oc­cur in peo­ple who, in re­sponse to a spe­cific stim­u­lus such as a bee sting or med­i­ca­tion, ex­pe­ri­ence swelling around the mouth, eyes or face, have dif­fi­culty breath­ing or ex­pe­ri­ence a se­ri­ous drop in blood pres­sure, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim Poh Lian, di­rec­tor of the high-level iso­la­tion unit at the National Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers who be­long to cer­tain groups – such as preg­nant women, im­muno­com­pro­mised per­sons and those un­der the age of 16 – should also hold off on re­ceiv­ing the shots, as large-scale clin­i­cal tri­als have not in­volved such vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>But the ex­perts speak­ing at a we­bi­nar hosted by The Straits Times yes­ter­day noted that bar­ring these groups, those here of­fered a Covid-19 vac­cine should take it.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Lim: “What we want to do is make sure that peo­ple around them are vac­ci­nated.”</p>
    <p>Added Prof Lim, who is also a mem­ber of the ex­pert com­mit­tee on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ap­pointed by the Health Min­istry: “Ev­ery­one who is el­i­gi­ble should get the vac­cine, be­cause we want to pro­tect peo­ple who ei­ther can’t get (the vac­cine) or those who might not get as much ben­e­fit from the vac­cine even if they re­ceive one.”</p>
    <p>She was one of three ex­perts who spoke at the we­bi­nar. The oth­ers were Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, an ex­pert in emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and co-de­vel­oper of a Covid-19 vac­cine; and Mr Ashish Pal, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Merck Sharp & Dohme in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Those at great­est risk will be given pri­or­ity, in­clud­ing health­care work­ers and front-line per­son­nel, as well as the el­derly and vul­ner­a­ble. Even those with other ill­nesses, such as heart prob­lems, should get vac­ci­nated as clin­i­cal tri­als have eval­u­ated safety among this group.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said the clin­i­cal tri­als were de­signed to take into ac­count those who are at risk of se­vere Covid-19, in­clud­ing those with heart prob­lems, can­cer, high blood pres­sure and di­a­betes, for ex­am­ple. “So in that sense, what the trial man­aged to in­clude, we know that the data points to­wards safety,” he said.</p>
    <p>But other groups should wait for more in­for­ma­tion. They in­clude:</p>
    <p>THOSE WITH SE­VERE AL­LER­GIES</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Health Sciences Au­thor­ity has ad­vised that those with a history of ana­phy­laxis, or the rapid on­set of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions, should not re­ceive the vac­cine, as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Such re­ac­tions have been ob­served else­where. But this re­ac­tion is not unique to the coro­n­avirus shot, said Prof Lim. “All med­i­ca­tions can po­ten­tially cause al­ler­gies, or even ana­phy­laxis, which is the more se­ri­ous form with hy­per­sen­si­tiv­ity, (and) it can hap­pen im­me­di­ately,” she said at the we­bi­nar.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, such re­ac­tions are known to oc­cur when penicillin is ad­min­is­tered. “But we don’t stop us­ing penicillin, we just have to know that it can hap­pen and be pre­pared for it, to man­age the pa­tient safely. So the same is go­ing to be true for the (Covid-19) vac­cine,” she said.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim ex­plained that the ex­pert com­mit­tee had looked at the in­for­ma­tion com­ing in from abroad be­fore rec­om­mend­ing that peo­ple with se­ri­ous ana­phy­lac­tic re­ac­tions may want to hold off on get­ting the Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“That’s per­fectly valid be­cause we are try­ing to be safe. But when we give the vac­cine, even some­one with­out a (history of de­vel­op­ing a) re­ac­tion could have a re­ac­tion, and we’re go­ing to be putting those safety (mea­sures) in place,” she said.</p>
    <p>PREG­NANT WOMEN AND CHIL­DREN</p>
    <p>De­ter­min­ing whether a vac­cine is safe for cer­tain groups of peo­ple needs to be guided by data from vac­cine stud­ies.</p>
    <p>And since stud­ies have not been done to eval­u­ate how the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vac­cine could af­fect fer­til­ity or young chil­dren, ex­perts are ad­vis­ing preg­nant women and those un­der 16 to wait for more data be­fore get­ting in­oc­u­lated.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi said: “The stud­ies to show that the vac­cines can be used safely in peo­ple who are plan­ning for preg­nancy or who are al­ready preg­nant have not been com­pleted. But it doesn’t mean that it’s not safe, that it’ll cause steril­ity. It does not mean that at all.”</p>
    <p>More­over, women who fall in this cat­e­gory will likely not be in the first few groups to be of­fered a Covid-19 vac­cine in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Lim: “It’s in my DNA to be sort of ki­asu (very cau­tious). And so, un­til the data comes, we’re prob­a­bly go­ing to say, hold off un­til we get more data, be­cause we want to do this as safely as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, based on her past ex­pe­ri­ences with vac­cines – such as those for hepati­tis A, hepati­tis B or tetanus – Prof Lim said she does not think this vac­cine would cause any prob­lems with fer­til­ity.</p>
    <p>Prof Ooi noted that the goal is to also be able to vac­ci­nate chil­dren, who may in­ter­act with their grand­par­ents – a group that faces higher risk of de­vel­op­ing se­ri­ous ill­ness when in­fected.</p>
    <p>But he added: “The tri­als have nat­u­rally fo­cused on the more vul­ner­a­ble pop­u­la­tion first. But the plan would, of course, even­tu­ally be to cover the rest of the pop­u­la­tion not cur­rently cov­ered by the (late-stage) trial.”</p>
    <p>IM­MUNO­COM­PRO­MISED PER­SONS</p>
    <p>Prof Lim noted that be­ing im­muno­com­pro­mised – or hav­ing a weak­ened im­mune sys­tem – is a con­di­tion that falls on a spec­trum.</p>
    <p>“So for ex­am­ple, some­one with leukaemia, which is a kind of blood can­cer, would be clearly im­muno­com­pro­mised,” she noted. Those who have had an or­gan trans­plant would also be con­sid­ered as such.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many ques­tions re­main, she said. “If they were treated for leukaemia, say, a year ago, are they still im­muno­com­pro­mised? Well, it’s prob­a­bly a spec­trum as you re­cover from chemo­ther­apy.”</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said that to an­swer these ques­tions, more data is needed for each spe­cific group of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A crit­i­cal part of the dis­tri­bu­tion of the tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive Covid-19 vac­cines made by Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as Moderna, is to en­sure that a spec­i­fied tem­per­a­ture range is main­tained.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, strin­gent checks are in place to en­sure the cold chain for vac­cines is not com­pro­mised and that the vac­cines re­main safe and ef­fec­tive, ex­perts said yes­ter­day dur­ing a Straits Times we­bi­nar on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Their as­sur­ance comes af­ter the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced on Mon­day its plans to roll out Covid-19 vac­cines in Sin­ga­pore soon, in­clud­ing the Pfizer-BioNTech shot which has been ap­proved by the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine is al­ready be­ing ad­min­is­tered in Bri­tain and the United States, while Canada and Mex­ico have au­tho­rised its use.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ad­min­is­ters all man­ner of vac­cines daily, and “the cold chain man­age­ment is very much a part of the nor­mal process”, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim Poh Lian, a mem­ber of an ex­pert com­mit­tee on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ap­pointed by the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Trav­eller’s</p>
    <p>Health and Vac­ci­na­tion Clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal, which Prof Lim heads, has tem­per­a­ture­con­trolled re­frig­er­a­tors that record and trig­ger an alarm over any de­vi­a­tion from pre­scribed tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>Such de­vi­a­tions can re­sult from the fridge break­ing down or the elec­tric­ity go­ing off, but there will be a record of it, said Prof Lim, adding that the clinic has thrown away vac­cines be­fore, when fridges broke down.</p>
    <p>“That’s part of the com­mit­ment that we make to safety and qual­ity.”</p>
    <p>She also said there is no rea­son to think it would be any dif­fer­ent for Covid-19 vac­cines, since so much at­ten­tion is be­ing paid to them.</p>
    <p>An­other speaker at the we­bi­nar was Mr Ashish Pal, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Merck Sharp & Dohme in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>He noted that dif­fer­ent vac­cines have dif­fer­ent tem­per­a­ture re­quire­ments, and their safety and ef­fi­cacy can be com­pro­mised if there is any fluc­tu­a­tion in tem­per­a­ture dur­ing the trans­port process lead­ing up to the ad­min­is­ter­ing of the shot.</p>
    <p>“If you look at some of the re­cently ap­proved prod­ucts, com­pa­nies have done a tremen­dous amount of work to en­sure that the ro­bust­ness of the dis­tri­bu­tion process is in­tact,” said Mr Pal.</p>
    <p>“So there are very clear checks and bal­ances along the way to en­sure there is no com­pro­mise on the stor­age con­di­tions along­side trans­porta­tion con­di­tions,” he said.</p>
