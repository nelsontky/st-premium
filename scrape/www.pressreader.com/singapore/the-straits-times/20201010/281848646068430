    <p>NEW YORK • The United States De­part­ment of Justice has sued Yale Univer­sity, ac­cus­ing the Ivy League school of il­le­gally dis­crim­i­nat­ing against Asian and white ap­pli­cants in un­der­grad­u­ate ad­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>The law­suit on Thurs­day es­ca­lates the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s push against af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion in ad­mis­sions to elite uni­ver­si­ties, af­ter it pub­licly sup­ported a law­suit by Asian-Amer­i­can stu­dents ac­cus­ing Har­vard Univer­sity of dis­crim­i­nat­ing against them.</p>
    <p>The Justice De­part­ment said Asian-Amer­i­can and white ap­pli­cants were typ­i­cally only oneeighth to one-fourth as likely to win ad­mis­sion to Yale as sim­i­larly qual­i­fied black ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>In a com­plaint filed in the fed­eral court in New Haven, Con­necti­cut, where Yale is based, the Justice De­part­ment said Yale’s prac­tices vi­o­late Ti­tle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Yale must com­ply with that law to re­ceive fed­eral fund­ing, which the gov­ern­ment said in­cludes more than US$630 mil­lion (S$854 mil­lion) an­nu­ally from the De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices alone.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­cants must be “judged by their char­ac­ter, tal­ents and achieve­ments and not the colour of their skin”, said Mr Eric Dreiband, an as­sis­tant at­tor­ney­gen­eral for civil rights. “To do oth­er­wise is to per­mit our in­sti­tu­tions to foster stereo­types, bit­ter­ness and di­vi­sion.”</p>
    <p>The law­suit fol­lowed a two-year probe into Yale’s prac­tices. “Yale does not dis­crim­i­nate against ap­pli­cants of any race or eth­nic­ity,” its pres­i­dent Peter Salovey said, and will not change its ad­mis­sions poli­cies be­cause of the “base­less” law­suit. “We look for­ward to de­fend­ing these poli­cies in court.” The school has 6,057 un­der­grad­u­ates, and typ­i­cally ac­cepts just 6 per cent of ap­pli­cants for ad­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Har­vard is await­ing a de­ci­sion from the fed­eral ap­peals court in Bos­ton on its ad­mis­sions prac­tices. A fed­eral judge up­held them last year af­ter find­ing the school had no work­able “race-neu­tral al­ter­na­tives” to build a di­verse stu­dent body. The US Supreme Court has al­lowed race to be used in col­lege ad­mis­sions to pro­mote di­ver­sity in the class­room. Op­po­nents of af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion hope the court’s con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity might end the prac­tice in a fu­ture case.</p>
