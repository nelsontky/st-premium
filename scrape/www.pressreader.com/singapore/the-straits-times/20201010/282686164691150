    <p>Singer-song­writer Ben­jamin Kheng is in the run­ning for Best South-east Asia Act at this year’s MTV EMA (Europe Mu­sic Awards).</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony will be aired on MTV Asia (Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 350, StarHub TV Chan­nel 533) on Nov 9 at 9.40pm.</p>
    <p>Fel­low Sin­ga­porean and elec­tronic mu­sic artist Jas­mine Sokko won the prize in Spain last year, beat­ing pop­u­lar re­gional acts such as Malaysia’s Yuna and In­done­sia’s Rich Brian.</p>
    <p>EMA win­ners are de­cided by the pub­lic and fans can vote at mtvema.com/en-asia/vote.</p>
    <p>Kheng, a mem­ber of home-grown pop quar­tet The Sam Wil­lows, re­leased his de­but solo EP, A Sea That Never Stops, in June. It has gar­nered 2.5 mil­lion streams across var­i­ous stream­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The Sam Wil­lows were up for the same award in 2015, 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Kheng, 30, says he was sur­prised to be nom­i­nated for the award along­side acts such as In­done­sian singer-ac­tress Agnez Mo and Filipino in­die band Ben&Ben.</p>
    <p>“If some­one ever told me I’d get nom­i­nated in the same cat­e­gory as Agnez Mo and Ben&Ben, I would have shouted ‘fake news’,” he says. “It’s an in­cred­i­ble hon­our to be in their es­teemed com­pany and I’m go­ing to go eat a lot of ice cream to cel­e­brate.”</p>
    <p>The other nom­i­nees are Malaysian hip-hop group K-Clique, Thai singer-ac­tress Vi­o­lette Wau­tier and Viet­namese singer Jack.</p>
    <p>The Sam Wil­lows, formed in 2011, have re­leased a self-ti­tled EP (2012) and two al­bums, Take Heart (2015) and I Know, But Where (2018).</p>
    <p>Their mu­sic has topped the lo­cal iTunes charts and the band have played gigs at fes­ti­vals such as SXSW Fes­ti­val in Austin, Texas, and Sum­mer Sonic in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Kheng, who re­leased his de­but sin­gle, Wicked, in Novem­ber last year, is ex­pected to re­lease his next sin­gle early next year.</p>
    <p>He is also known for his act­ing. His screen cred­its in­clude roles in pro­duc­tions such as 2014’s Ah Boys To Men: The Musical and Dick Lee’s 2017 musical film Won­der Boy.</p>
