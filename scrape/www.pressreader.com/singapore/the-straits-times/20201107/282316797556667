    <p>On good days dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, Mary (not her real name), 15, could at­tend her home-based lessons punc­tu­ally and hand in her home­work on time.</p>
    <p>But on other days, she waited for more than four hours to use her 21-year-old brother’s lap­top, as it was the only com­puter at home.</p>
    <p>“If I see him not us­ing it, then I will use it. But if he is busy, then I will try to do my home­work or have my lessons on my phone,” said the Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent, who lives in a two-room rental flat in the east­ern part of Sin­ga­pore with her par­ents, brother and younger sis­ter, aged 13.</p>
    <p>She added that do­ing home­work on her phone was tough, given the small screen.</p>
    <p>Things are much bet­ter for Mary now, thanks to a do­nated lap­top from the Care Com­mu­nity Ser­vices So­ci­ety. She was one of the many chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies here who re­ceived such com­put­ers ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>As part of the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures to stem the spread of Covid-19, stu­dents had to shift to full home-based learn­ing (HBL) from April 8, which led to a rush for lap­tops.</p>
    <p>Char­i­ties and so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions col­lected do­nated lap­tops for the needy, and the Gov­ern­ment said fam­i­lies could also turn to the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s NEU-PC Plus scheme.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2006, the scheme of­fers stu­dents from low-in­come house­holds a new per­sonal com­puter, bun­dled with three years of free In­ter­net con­nec­tiv­ity. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, the scheme was ad­justed to make it faster and eas­ier for ben­e­fi­cia­ries to ob­tain PCs.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts agreed that lap­tops have be­come es­sen­tial for learn­ing now – a view shared by par­ents whom In­sight spoke to.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal as­sis­tant Sarah, 26, re­ceived a lap­top un­der the NEU-PC Plus scheme af­ter a re­fer­ral by non­profit group AMP Sin­ga­pore. She was re­lieved be­cause her per­sonal lap­top was not work­ing prop­erly and she was wor­ried about how her two chil­dren, aged nine and 10, would han­dle HBL.</p>
    <p>“Some lessons can­not be ac­cessed us­ing a phone, some can be ac­cessed only via lap­top. And on a lap­top, the screen is big­ger – on the phone, there are no key­boards and it’s just a big screen. The lap­top has it all,” said Ms Sarah, a sin­gle par­ent who de­clined to give her full name.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts and par­ents said there re­main chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies who fall through the cracks, and face the risk of be­ing left be­hind as Sin­ga­pore re­alises its Smart Na­tion dreams.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences economist Wal­ter Th­e­seira said the pan­demic has spurred ef­forts to ad­dress the dig­i­tal di­vide among chil­dren, but a more per­ma­nent so­lu­tion needs to be found.</p>
    <p>“Anec­do­tally, a num­ber of is­sues sur­faced from these at­tempts to con­nect chil­dren on­line, in­clud­ing con­cerns from par­ents about be­ing fi­nan­cially re­spon­si­ble for com­puter equip­ment, fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties with get­ting broad­band sub­scrip­tions (and) is­sues with shar­ing equip­ment among chil­dren,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Th­e­seira.</p>
    <p>Dr Natalie Pang, a se­nior lec­turer at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) De­part­ment of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and New Me­dia, sim­i­larly pointed out that chil­dren in low-in­come fam­i­lies here might lack proper sup­port or a con­ducive space to do their HBL.</p>
    <p>This was some­thing chil­dren such as Regina (not her real name), 10, told In­sight about.</p>
    <p>She and her mother Nancy (not her real name), 42, live in a three­room Hous­ing Board flat, which they share with three ten­ants.</p>
    <p>Regina usu­ally uses her PC in the hall­way at home, but as ten­ants often walk past in the back­ground, she was told by a teacher to at­tend lessons in an area free of such dis­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Nancy, a sin­gle par­ent who works part-time as an ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant, had to move the PC to the bed­room for these classes. As the ta­ble in the room was dam­aged, Regina, a Pri­mary 4 pupil, had to use the bed in­stead.</p>
    <p>Ms Nancy also some­times finds her­self ill-equipped to help her only child with IT is­sues.</p>
    <p>“Some­times my daugh­ter asks, where is the Pow­erPoint or some other things – some­times I don’t know, and I also need to study be­fore I can help her,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Pang said younger stu­dents are usu­ally un­able to trou­bleshoot tech is­sues them­selves and it is im</p>
    <p>por­tant to have some­one at home who can help.</p>
    <p>“Lower-in­come stu­dents often lack ad­e­quate sup­port­ive net­works as their par­ents or guardians may be work­ing in low-in­come jobs or strug­gle with dig­i­tal lit­er­acy is­sues them­selves,” she added.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Irene Ng of the NUS So­cial Ser­vice Re­search Cen­tre and De­part­ment of So­cial Work sug­gested merg­ing the ap­pli­ca­tion form for sub­sidised lap­tops or com­put­ers in schools with the form for the MOE Fi­nan­cial As­sis­tance scheme, so that pro­vi­sion of these de­vices for stu­dents can be stream­lined.</p>
    <p>Ms No­rashikin Ab­dul Re­faiie, a com­mu­nity worker at Be­yond So­cial Ser­vices, also sug­gested al­low­ing stu­dents to reap­ply for new lap­tops af­ter two years, in­stead of the cur­rent three-year pe­riod for the NEU-PC Plus scheme. She noted that a few stu­dents’ lap­tops had failed be­fore the three-year mark.</p>
    <p>But pro­vid­ing such chil­dren with lap­tops is only the first step.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts such as Dr Pang felt it is also im­por­tant to build dig­i­tal lit­er­acy among those from low-in­come back­grounds, so that they know how to use tech­nol­ogy to add value to their lives.</p>
    <p>“While dig­i­tal in­clu­sion often be­gins with ac­cess to de­vices – it is not the end so­lu­tion. With­out enough sup­port and pro­grammes to build ca­pac­ity, the de­vice may end up be­ing used wrongly or be a white ele­phant.”</p>
