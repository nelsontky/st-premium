    <p>A sin­gle Covid-19 case in the com­mu­nity was re­ported by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient is asymp­to­matic and his in­fec­tion was de­tected when he went for a pre­de­par­ture Covid-19 test last Satur­day be­fore a trip to the United States.</p>
    <p>He is a 35-year-old Nepalese man on a short-term visit pass in Sin­ga­pore. He was al­lowed en­try into the coun­try to visit fam­ily mem­bers who are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from Nepal on Nov 1 and was placed on a 14-day stay­home no­tice (SHN) on ar­rival un­til Nov 15. He tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 on Nov 11 while serv­ing SHN. Af­ter that, he stayed at a friend’s flat in Bis­han Street 22 and vis­ited his fam­ily in Yishun Av­enue 6, the MOH said in a press state­ment last night.</p>
    <p>His case is cur­rently un­linked. He was taken to hos­pi­tal when his test came back pos­i­tive on Sun­day. The MOH also said that his sero­log­i­cal test re­sult was pos­i­tive, in­di­cat­ing a prob­a­ble past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The MOH said that epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are i n progress and all iden­ti­fied close con­tacts have been iso­lated and placed in quar­an­tine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Last night, MOH also re­ported four im­ported Covid-19 cases, com­pris­ing one Sin­ga­porean and three work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean was a 31-year-old man who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from Ja­pan. Two of the work per­mit hold­ers came from In­done­sia, and one came from In­dia.</p>
    <p>All four were placed on SHN at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties on ar­rival. They were all asymp­to­matic when tested, and tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>The MOH added sev­eral lo­ca­tions in­clud­ing Ion Or­chard to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>MOH added that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there was no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>There were no cases from within dor­mi­to­ries an­nounced for the 20th con­sec­u­tive day.</p>
    <p>An­other 10 pa­tients were dis­charged yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal num­ber who have fully re­cov­ered to 58,119.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 29 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 26 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
