    <p>NEW YORK • Ellen DeGeneres (left) on Mon­day opened the 18th sea­son of her talk show that has been mired in controvers­y for months, with a broad apol­ogy that ad­dressed al­le­ga­tions of a toxic work­place cul­ture un­der her watch.</p>
    <p>It was the first time the sta­ple of day­time Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion pub­licly ad­dressed the controvers­y sur­round­ing her, af­ter Buz­zFeed News pub­lished a re­port over the sum­mer de­tail­ing a cul­ture of fear among her em­ploy­ees, which in­cluded ac­cu­sa­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct, racism and in­tim­i­da­tion from the show’s man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The scathing re­ports fol­lowed ru­mours and anec­do­tal posts on so­cial me­dia that DeGeneres, 62, was dif­fi­cult to work with – and not nearly as nice as her feel-good show por­trayed her to be.</p>
    <p>“I want to say I am so sorry to the peo­ple who were af­fected. I know that I’m in a po­si­tion of priv­i­lege and power and I re­alised that with that comes re­spon­si­bil­ity, and I take re­spon­si­bil­ity for what hap­pens at my show,” DeGeneres said in her open­ing mono­logue, re­leased on­line ahead of its broad­cast on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>DeGeneres said her pro­gramme was kick­ing off a “new chap­ter” af­ter “nec­es­sary changes” fol­low­ing an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion from par­ent com­pany Warn­erMe­dia, though she did not go into de­tail on any of the re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Last month, three high-level pro­duc­ers were let go – ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Ed Glavin, co-ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Jonathan Nor­man and head writer Kevin Le­man.</p>
    <p>The long-time come­di­enne, ac­tress and host also joked that she was in a tough po­si­tion given her rep­u­ta­tion as the “be kind” woman, a nick­name she said she earned af­ter she urged kind­ness fol­low­ing the 2010 sui­cide of a young man who was bul­lied for be­ing gay.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing known as the ‘be kind’ lady is a tricky po­si­tion to be in,” DeGeneres said. “So, let me give you some ad­vice out there if any­body’s think­ing of chang­ing her ti­tle or giv­ing her­self a nick­name. Do not go with the ‘be kind’ lady. Don’t do it.”</p>
    <p>“The truth is I am that per­son that you see on TV,” she con­tin­ued, deny­ing al­le­ga­tions that off­stage, her per­son­al­ity was a far cry from the sunny per­sona she has crafted on­stage.</p>
    <p>DeGeneres made waves in 1997 af­ter be­com­ing one of the first tele­vi­sion stars to pub­licly come out as gay, which she did while star­ring in the sit­com Ellen.</p>
    <p>Last year, prior to the scan­dal sur­round­ing her epony­mous show, she re­newed her host­ing con­tract through 2022, also ink­ing a deal to cre­ate three shows for stream­ing plat­form HBO Max.</p>
