    <p>While at a fu­neral wake in Cir­cuit Road, 13 sus­pected mem­bers of a se­cret so­ci­ety al­legedly chanted gang slo­gans to show off their affiliatio­n to the group.</p>
    <p>This hap­pened on April 5 this year, just be­fore the cir­cuit breaker to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus took ef­fect on April 7.</p>
    <p>At that time, safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures lim­it­ing gath­er­ings to 10 in­di­vid­u­als were al­ready in place.</p>
    <p>Twelve of them were charged in court yes­ter­day with one count each of breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures over the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>They also face charges of be­ing a mem­ber of an un­law­ful so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Two of them can­not be named as they are be­low 18 years old.</p>
    <p>The other 10 are Alvin Mo Boon Heng, 35; Baey Xin Yu, 25; Don Tham, 25; Eug­ine Lee Eng Qin, 19; Ju­lian Kuah Jun Hong, 19; Luo Jun Yuan, 24; Tay Wee Keong, 24; Yu Wei Jie, 22; Cedric Teo Khai Boon, 19, and Lim Wei Xuan, 26.</p>
    <p>Lim is said to have rented a pavil­ion for the wake.</p>
    <p>He is ac­cused of breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures by al­legedly al­low­ing more than 10 in­di­vid­u­als to en­ter the venue, while the rest are said to have done so by gath­er­ing and con­duct­ing a “se­cret so­ci­ety rit­ual” at the fu­neral wake.</p>
    <p>Mo, Lee, Lim and Tay were also charged with al­legedly invit­ing other in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing Kuah and Luo, to join their se­cret so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The 13th in­di­vid­ual – 34-year-old Ong Teck Wei – did not at­tend the court hear­ing as he was ar­rested for al­leged drug of­fences ear­lier in the morn­ing, the court heard yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Court records show that he faces a sim­i­lar charge over his in­volve­ment in the in­ci­dent at the wake and other charges in con­nec­tion with gang-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, the po­lice said the group had chanted gang slo­gans at the wake to show off their se­cret so­ci­ety links.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court records, Yu and Teo have other cases against them.</p>
    <p>Yu is fac­ing charges for of­fences in­volv­ing duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes while Teo is sched­uled to be sen­tenced next month for of­fences re­lated to gang ac­tiv­i­ties and loan­shark ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mo, Lim, Lee, Luo and one of the ac­cused un­der the age of 18 in­di­cated that they would be plead­ing guilty to their of­fences.</p>
    <p>All 13 in­di­vid­u­als are ex­pected to be back in court separately on var­i­ous dates this month and the next.</p>
    <p>If found guilty of the gang-re­lated of­fence, each in­di­vid­ual could be fined up to $5,000 and/or jailed for up to three years.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused can also each be fined up to $10,000 and/or jailed for up to six months if con­victed of breach­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
