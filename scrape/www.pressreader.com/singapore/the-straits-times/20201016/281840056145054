    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple oc­cu­pied an in­ter­sec­tion in down­town Bangkok yes­ter­day in de­fi­ance of the gov­ern­ment’s dec­la­ra­tion of a “se­ri­ous emer­gency”, de­mand­ing that de­tained lead­ers of a months-long protest move­ment be freed.</p>
    <p>The mostly young pro­test­ers, watched closely by 2,500 po­lice of­fi­cers, brought traf­fic to a stand­still at Ratchapra­song junc­tion in the com­mer­cial dis­trict, chant­ing slo­gans like “I am not afraid”, “free our friends” and “lack­eys of dic­ta­tors”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing through loud­hail­ers on the back of pick-up trucks, protest lead­ers like Panupong Jad­nok de­clared: “We are fight­ing till our deaths.”</p>
    <p>Malls in the area shut early. Ratchapra­song was last oc­cu­pied in 2014 by pro­test­ers seek­ing to drive out the gov­ern­ment headed by then Prime Min­is­ter Yingluck Shi­nawa­tra. The un­rest ended in a mil­i­tary coup.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s dec­la­ra­tion of se­ri­ous emer­gency in Bangkok, is­sued in the wee hours, banned pub­lic gath­er­ings of five or more peo­ple. It gave se­cu­rity of­fi­cials broad pow­ers to cen­sor news, de­tain sus­pects and search peo­ple with­out war­rants. It also put the power of ex­er­cis­ing this de­cree in the hands of Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Prawit Wong­suwan.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has tech­ni­cally been un­der a state of emer­gency since March, a sta­tus that of­fi­cials say helps them over­come ad­min­is­tra­tive hur­dles to con­trol the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s el­e­vated emer­gency de­cree came a day after some antigov­ern­ment pro­test­ers shouted abuse and flashed the three-fin­ger anti-dic­ta­tor­ship salute at a pass­ing con­voy bear­ing Queen Suthida and Prince Di­pangkorn Ras­mi­joti in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>Later that evening, thou­sands of pro­test­ers oc­cu­pied the streets sur­round­ing the Gov­ern­ment House.</p>
    <p>The largely peace­ful, youth-led ral­lies are tak­ing place dur­ing one of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s so­journs in Thai­land. The King, who spends much of his time in Ger­many, has been crit­i­cised by protest lead­ers for his ex­pen­di­ture and pow­ers, which they say ex­ceed his of­fi­cial sta­tus as a con­sti­tu­tional monarch. He per­son­ally con­trols two army units.</p>
    <p>The open crit­i­cism has caused a back­lash among roy­al­ists, who mus­tered sup­port­ers to dress in yel­low and line the streets of in­ner Bangkok on Wed­nes­day to greet the King’s con­voy as it made its way to a royal tem­ple for a re­li­gious cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, po­lice swooped in to ar­rest sev­eral key protest lead­ers, in­clud­ing hu­man rights lawyer Arnon Nampa and univer­sity stu­dents Parit Chi­warak and Panusaya Sit hiji raw at tan akul. Pic­tures on so­cial me­dia showed Panusaya be­ing taken away in a wheel­chair as she pas­sively re­sisted ar­rest. They have re­port­edly been de­nied bail.</p>
    <p>Po­lice spokesman Kis­sana Phathanach­aroen told The Straits Times yes­ter­day evening: “We have made our­selves quite clear that these peo­ple have gath­ered in bad faith. They are not al­lowed to stay in this area.”</p>
    <p>Ju­tatip Sirikhan, one of the stu­dent protest l ead­ers, said in a recorded state­ment: “The emer­gency de­cree is the ef­fort by the state to dis­cour­age the democ­racy move­ment, ob­struct the peo­ple and hold on to power.”</p>
    <p>The protest move­ment aims to amend the 2017 Con­sti­tu­tion, which crit­ics say is de­signed to keep Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha in power. The former coup leader now leads a coali­tion gov­ern­ment, but sev­eral former junta lead­ers, in­clud­ing Mr Prawit, con­tinue to hold key po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Leg­is­la­tors were due to be­gin amend­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion last month, but un­ex­pect­edly de­layed it dur­ing a joint ses­sion of the Lower and Up­per Houses. Pro­test­ers want to put pres­sure on l aw­mak­ers ahead of the next Par­lia­ment sit­ting, which will take place on Nov 1.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, re­ports of an i ncreased se­cu­rity pres­ence in Par­lia­ment stirred un­ease in the coup­prone coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Pita Lim­jaroen­rat, leader of the Move For­ward Party, whose law­mak­ers have been ac­tive in bail­ing out protest lead­ers, told re­porters: “There are now sol­diers in Par­lia­ment. I’m not sure if this is ap­pro­pri­ate be­cause we al­ready have Par­lia­ment po­lice sta­tioned there. I won­der if this was al­lowed by the House Speaker.”</p>
    <p>Dr Eak­pant Pi­da­vanija, a former direc­tor of Mahi­dol Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of Hu­man Rights and Peace Stud­ies, feared the gov­ern­ment’s at­tempt to im­pose con­trol will drive more pro­test­ers onto the streets.</p>
    <p>“On sev­eral oc­ca­sions in the pre­vi­ous decade, the emer­gency de­cree did not stop peo­ple from com­ing out onto the streets,” he told ST. “The gov­ern­ment is try­ing to in­stil fear, but I think it will have the op­po­site ef­fect.”</p>
