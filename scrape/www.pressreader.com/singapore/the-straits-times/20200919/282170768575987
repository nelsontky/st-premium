    <p>It is dis­heart­en­ing that many Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) cabin crew have been re­trenched due to the pan­demic’s near-dec­i­ma­tion of in­ter­na­tional travel.</p>
    <p>Even SIA em­ploy­ees un­der­go­ing train­ing to be pi­lots or cabin crew were not spared. Half of them have been let go, while the rest will leave af­ter their train­ing</p>
    <p>(Half of SIA pi­lot, cabin crew trainees al­lowed to com­plete train­ing, Sept 16).</p>
    <p>Their SIA train­ing in ser­vice ex­cel­lence should not go to waste. The well-trained and skilled cabin crew who were re­trenched could be em­ployed by other com­pa­nies pro­vid­ing front-line ser­vices. The qual­i­fied pi­lots could re­learn on the job to work as drone pi­lots at start-ups.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, SIA’s in-house train­ers, train­ing pro­grammes and fa­cil­i­ties could be of­fered to other com­pa­nies for a fee, af­ter repurposin­g or adapt­ing the cour­ses to meet their needs.</p>
    <p>Some of the cabin crew and pi­lots to be re­tained by SIA could serve on the air­line’s planned “flights to nowhere” if and when this takes off (SIA eye­ing ‘flights to nowhere’ to give a lift to ail­ing busi­ness, Sept 13).</p>
    <p>Imag­ine Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents check­ing into SQ flights at Changi Air­port but re­turn­ing to the air­port for a shop­ping spree at Jewel, af­ter en­joy­ing three hours of in-flight ser­vice, with es­sen­tial safe mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­rival, they are taken in a limou­sine to a lo­cal ho­tel for their stay­ca­tion, be­fore start­ing on their tours of lo­cal at­trac­tions the next day.</p>
    <p>For many Sin­ga­pore­ans, such a pack­age could turn out to be a lib­er­at­ing or even ther­a­peu­tic ex­pe­ri­ence dur­ing the cur­rent cri­sis.</p>
    <p>It may serve as a timely so­lu­tion for SIA and some of the busi­nesses in the tourism in­dus­try.</p>
