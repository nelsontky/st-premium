    <p>Ei­ther vet­eran lawyer Ed­mond Pereira or Go­jek gen­eral man­ager Lien Choong Luen will be voted in on Fri­day as just the fourth Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) pres­i­dent in 38 years. Both agree that there is a lot of dis­cord and a lack of trust in the fra­ter­nity that the win­ning team will need to tackle.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent elec­tion process could throw up an in­trigu­ing sce­nario for Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) at its an­nual gen­eral meet­ing at Nexus Au­di­to­rium, Cup­page Plaza, on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>SA’s 23 af­fil­i­ates will vote for nine out of the 18 can­di­dates to make up the as­so­ci­a­tion’s new man­age­ment com­mit­tee (MC).</p>
    <p>There will not be any in­di­ca­tion of teams on the bal­lot forms, and af­fil­i­ates have to tick against nine names. Any slip that does not con­tain ex­actly nine votes will be re­garded as an in­valid or spoilt vote.</p>
    <p>The nine can­di­dates with the most votes will be elected into of­fice, and at least one of them has to be a woman. If the top nine can­di­dates com­prise only men, the fe­male can­di­date with the most votes will take the place of the ninthranke­d male can­di­date.</p>
    <p>The po­si­tion each elected mem­ber will take up will only be de­cided by the new nineper­son MC at its first meet­ing af­ter the elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­fore 2016, af­fil­i­ates voted separately for each con­tested po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>This could mean that pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates Lien Choong Luen and Ed­mond Pereira, who head Team Ground Up and TeamSGP Ath­let­ics re­spec­tively, could find them­selves in the same team if they are among the nine with the high­est num­ber of votes.</p>
    <p>But if that hap­pens, ei­ther team that has a sim­ple ma­jor­ity in the nine-mem­ber MC will have the edge in ap­point­ing the new SA chief.</p>
    <p>There will also be two non­elected mem­bers of the com­mit­tee: The ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor (a full-time em­ployee) and an ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive. The ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor does not have a vote, while the ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive post is cur­rently va­cant.</p>
