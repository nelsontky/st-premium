    <p>The Sol­i­dar­ity trial is re­ally unique in that it en­rolled so many pa­tients from mid­dle-in­come coun­tries who are of­ten not in­cluded in large re­search tri­als. Also, its sim­ple study de­sign with min­i­mal pa­per­work, on­line re­port­ing and an ob­jec­tive, mean­ing­ful end point – death – is a model for fu­ture stud­ies of other in­fec­tious and even non-com­mu­ni­ca­ble diseases in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic is un­prece­dented in terms of its im­pact on the world.</p>
    <p>While other pan­demics have been more deadly, such as the plague, cholera and the 1918 Span­ish flu, they oc­curred be­fore the mod­ern era of an­timi­cro­bials.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the Covid-19 pan­demic, doc­tors and sci­en­tists have been look­ing hard for drugs which can be used to treat and pre­vent Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Public health in­ter­ven­tions such as quar­an­tine and con­tact trac­ing were and still are widely used to pre­vent in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, once in­fec­tion oc­curs, there is only sup­port­ive care. This of­ten means time in an in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) with the use of oxy­gen and other stan­dard med­i­cal treat­ments, but no spe­cific tar­geted op­tions against ei­ther the virus or the host im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>With the devel­op­ment of peni­cillin and other an­tibi­otics for bac­te­rial in­fec­tions, many pre­vi­ously deadly in­fec­tious diseases such as pneu­mo­nia and menin­gi­tis are no longer as deadly, and nei­ther are malaria and tu­ber­cu­lo­sis.</p>
    <p>Highly ac­tive an­tivi­ral agents were also de­vel­oped for the hu­man im­mun­od­e­fi­ciency virus and hep­ati­tis C.</p>
    <p>When de­vel­op­ing new virusspe­cific drugs from scratch, it can take years (prob­a­bly about 10 to 15 years on av­er­age) to move from dis­cov­ery to pa­tients, so the only op­tion ini­tially in treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients was to con­sider ex­ist­ing li­censed medicines.</p>
    <p>This process is known as re­pur­pos­ing of drugs. It is not a new process and, in fact, one of the most ef­fec­tive car­diac drugs used to treat heart at­tacks is as­pirin, which was ini­tially de­vel­oped as a fever and pain medicine from the bark of the wil­low tree.</p>
    <p>When any treat­ment is used for a dis­ease, es­pe­cially for a brand new dis­ease such as Covid-19, it is im­por­tant to know whether the treat­ment works. This is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant for drugs which may have side ef­fects that are po­ten­tially harm­ful to pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity, how­ever, is that when a pa­tient is in front of us, we do not have time to wait for the re­sults of stud­ies pub­lished in med­i­cal jour­nals. So we use what­ever drugs avail­able that may have some ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a while, we ac­cu­mu­late enough data from the pa­tients we have treated to an­a­lyse the out­comes in ob­ser­va­tional stud­ies and re­port whether the drugs have any ben­e­fit at all.</p>
    <p>There have been mul­ti­ple ob­ser­va­tional stud­ies pub­lished since the early days of the Covid-19 pan­demic and many have made the head­lines, not with­out con­tro­versy and some con­fu­sion to the public.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is that th­ese ob­ser­va­tional stud­ies tend to be bi­ased and un­re­li­able. Treat­ment out­comes and con­found­ing is­sues may not be stan­dard­ised.</p>
    <p>Some­times pa­tients who are only mod­er­ately ill are more likely to re­ceive cer­tain drugs while pa­tients who are looked af­ter by cer­tain physi­cians may re­ceive no treat­ment at all, based on the pref­er­ences or be­liefs of the in­di­vid­ual pa­tients.</p>
    <p>CLIN­I­CAL TRI­ALS</p>
    <p>The so­lu­tion to this is the ran­domised clin­i­cal trial (RCT), which has been con­ducted in clin­i­cal medicine, in­clud­ing in­fec­tious diseases, for many years.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, the de­fin­i­tive treat­ment for tu­ber­cu­lo­sis was es­tab­lished through the United King­dom Med­i­cal Re­search Coun­cil tri­als con­ducted in many cen­tres, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ran­domi­sa­tion en­sures that pa­tients in all treat­ment groups are roughly com­pa­ra­ble, with the only dif­fer­ence be­ing the treat­ment as­signed to the group.</p>
    <p>This re­duces the bias found in ob­ser­va­tional stud­ies and al­lows us to de­ter­mine if the ef­fect is due to the drug be­ing stud­ied it­self.</p>
    <p>RCTs also have stan­dard­ised end points – such as length of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, need for oxy­gen, or death – which en­sure that the re­sults from the dif­fer­ent treat­ment arms can be ac­cu­rately com­pared.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple small ran­domised clin­i­cal tri­als have been pub­lished of the var­i­ous treat­ments for Sars-CoV-2, ini­tially from China and then, later, from all over the world. Th­ese stud­ies have been funded by ei­ther the drug com­pa­nies which de­vel­oped the drugs or the na­tional health au­thor­i­ties from the United States, Bri­tain and China.</p>
    <p>Due to dif­fer­ences in study de­sign – such as when the drugs were started – as well as drug dos­ing reg­i­mens and end points, the re­sults were of­ten con­tra­dic­tory, and the con­fu­sion from the ob­ser­va­tional stud­ies was only slightly re­duced.</p>
    <p>En­ter the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) Sol­i­dar­ity trial.</p>
    <p>In a re­mark­ably short time, the Sol­i­dar­ity ther­a­peu­tics trial ran­domised 11,266 adults ad­mit­ted to 405 hos­pi­tals in 30 coun­tries, from Al­ba­nia to South Africa.</p>
    <p>The trial de­sign was re­mark­ably sim­ple.</p>
    <p>Once the pa­tients gave in­formed con­sent to par­tic­i­pate in the trial, they were ran­domised on­line to one of up to five treat­ments, de­pend­ing on lo­cal avail­abil­ity of the drugs and stan­dard of care.</p>
    <p>The drugs used were remde­sivir, hy­drox­y­chloro­quine, lopinavir­ri­ton­avir and in­ter­feron, which was ini­tially used in com­bi­na­tion with lopinavir-ri­ton­avir.</p>
    <p>There were no forms to fill up but the doc­tors in charge of the pa­tients had to re­turn to the on­line sys­tem to re­port the out­comes and pro­vide de­tails such as how long the pa­tients were hos­pi­talised and whether they had any se­ri­ous ad­verse ef­fects or died.</p>
    <p>An “adap­tive trial de­sign” was used for the study, which al­lowed in­ves­ti­ga­tors to drop any of the arms if it did not work in in­terim analy­ses.</p>
    <p>WHY DIF­FER­ENT TRI­ALS PRO­DUCE DIF­FER­ENT RE­SULTS</p>
    <p>The trial started on March 22 with some en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>But by June 18, hy­drox­y­chloro­quine was dis­con­tin­ued for fu­til­ity, lopinavir-ri­ton­avir was stopped on July 4 and in­ter­feron, on Oct 16.</p>
    <p>An in­terim anal­y­sis of the pa­tients en­rolled up to Oct 4 was pub­lished re­cently as a pre-print, which means it has yet to be peer re­viewed.</p>
    <p>The re­sults in­di­cate that remde­sivir, hy­drox­y­chloro­quine, lopinavir-ri­ton­avir and in­ter­feron reg­i­mens ap­peared to have no ef­fect com­pared with stan­dard of care on the 28-day mor­tal­ity of Covid-19 among hos­pi­talised pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The re­sults dif­fer from the op­ti­mistic re­ports from stud­ies con­ducted by Gilead and the US Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health on remde­sivir – a drug ini­tially de­vel­oped to treat Ebola. There are sev­eral pos­si­ble rea­sons for the dis­par­ity.</p>
    <p>First, the pri­mary end point of the Sol­i­dar­ity trial is death. For many of the other tri­als, end points have in­cluded du­ra­tion of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion or time to clin­i­cal im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>It is pos­si­ble that remde­sivir may speed up re­cov­ery in those who are go­ing to re­cover but still has no im­pact on over­all sur­vival. The same has been true of RCTs of other an­tivi­rals such as os­eltamivir for in­fluenza.</p>
    <p>RCTs of treat­ment with hy­drox­y­chloro­quine and lopinavir-ri­ton­avir have not shown sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fits as well.</p>
    <p>While it is dis­ap­point­ing to note the re­sults of the Sol­i­dar­ity trial, it is not all gloom as the Re­cov­ery trial in the UK re­ported mean­ing­ful ben­e­fit in mor­tal­ity us­ing dex­am­etha­sone in ICU pa­tients but not in those not re­quir­ing oxy­gen ther­apy.</p>
    <p>This study did re­port an un­usual and alarm­ingly high ICU mor­tal­ity, which may ham­per its gen­er­al­is­abil­ity to other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>The other drugs in the Re­cov­ery trial, hy­drox­y­chloro­quine (which has been pub­lished in pre-print) and lopinavir-ri­ton­avir (not pub­lished but re­ported), also have no sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fits – sim­i­lar to the WHO Sol­i­dar­ity trial.</p>
    <p>This is im­por­tant as the abil­ity to re­pro­duce re­sults is one of the key tenets in sci­ence.</p>
    <p>COMMERCIAL­ISATION OF SCI­ENCE</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple are con­fused about the data from sci­en­tific re­search on Sars-CoV-2, which of­ten ap­pears on tele­vi­sion be­fore it has gone through rig­or­ous sci­en­tific peer review. That is partly due to the commercial­isation of sci­ence and medicine in the mod­ern era.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can the­o­ret­i­cal physi­cist Richard Feyn­man de­scribed the sci­en­tific method very well when he said that first, we make a guess or come up with a hy­poth­e­sis. Then we de­sign the ex­per­i­ment and see if our guess or hy­poth­e­sis is right.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Feyn­man said: “If it dis­agrees with ex­per­i­ment, it’s wrong.”</p>
    <p>That sim­ple state­ment is the key to sci­ence.</p>
    <p>So when large RCTs, which are the best-de­signed ex­per­i­ments in clin­i­cal medicine, are pub­lished, we can change the way we treat our pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Some­times it is painful and we have to give up our be­liefs based on good ob­ser­va­tional stud­ies, es­pe­cially when mul­ti­ple large, well-de­signed tri­als show the same thing.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cal ex­am­ples of this prob­lem are many. For ex­am­ple, Vi­ta­min A and E had, in large co­hort stud­ies, been shown to re­duce the risk of lung cancer.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when a large RCT was fi­nally done, not only did they not work, but in­stead, the vi­ta­mins in­creased the risk of death in the par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar find­ings were ob­served in stud­ies of high-dose chemo­ther­apy with stem cell trans­plants for ad­vanced breast cancer, where four RCTs showed no ben­e­fit com­pared with stan­dard chemo­ther­apy de­spite ob­ser­va­tional stud­ies ap­pear­ing to show some im­prove­ments in sur­vival for th­ese women.</p>
    <p>Once again, while the re­sults of the Sol­i­dar­ity trial are dis­ap­point­ing for clin­i­cians who treat pa­tients with Covid-19, there are still a num­ber of tri­als un­der way with re­pur­posed drugs to pre­vent the dis­ease, and also new drugs in devel­op­ment to try to treat those in­fected.</p>
    <p>The Sol­i­dar­ity trial is re­ally unique in that it en­rolled so many pa­tients from mid­dle-in­come coun­tries who are of­ten not in­cluded in large re­search tri­als.</p>
    <p>Also, its sim­ple study de­sign with min­i­mal pa­per­work, on­line re­port­ing and an ob­jec­tive, mean­ing­ful end point – death – is a model for fu­ture stud­ies of other in­fec­tious and even non-com­mu­ni­ca­ble diseases in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the peo­ple ben­e­fit when we have ob­jec­tive data from sci­ence to guide our treat­ment and pro­phy­laxis of the diseases which af­fect our well-be­ing.</p>
