    <p>More than two decades ago, a Pak­istani na­tional ap­ply­ing to be a per­ma­nent res­i­dent here lied to the au­thor­i­ties that his high­est aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tion was an arts de­gree from the Uni­ver­sity of Pun­jab.</p>
    <p>Mo­ham­mad So­hail also sub­mit­ted a forged de­gree to sup­port his ap­pli­ca­tion. In re­al­ity, his high­est qual­i­fi­ca­tion was the equiv­a­lent of the GCE A lev­els in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The 51-year-old yes­ter­day failed in his ap­peal to the High Court against a three-week jail sen­tence handed down by a district court last De­cem­ber. In dis­miss­ing the ap­peal, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon said that based on sen­tenc­ing guide­lines for such cases, the start­ing point was a cus­to­dial term of two to four weeks. He noted that the district judge, in im­pos­ing three weeks’ jail, had taken into ac­count that So­hail was re­morse­ful as he read­ily owned up to his wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>So­hail first ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in 1995 on an em­ploy­ment pass and mar­ried a Sin­ga­porean woman the fol­low­ing year. Be­tween Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber 1997, he ap­plied for per­ma­nent res­i­dence and falsely stated he had a Bach­e­lor of Arts from the Uni­ver­sity of Pun­jab.</p>
    <p>To boost his PR ap­pli­ca­tion chances, he sub­mit­ted a bo­gus de­gree, which he ob­tained from his cousin in Pak­istan. Court doc­u­ments state the aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tion of the ap­pli­cant is “one of the ma­te­rial con­sid­er­a­tions” in grant­ing of PR sta­tus.</p>
    <p>So­hail’s ap­pli­ca­tion was ap­proved in De­cem­ber 1997.</p>
    <p>The Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) said the of­fences were un­cov­ered dur­ing an in­ter­nal check. So­heil was first charged in Septem­ber last year, more than 21 years af­ter be­ing granted PR sta­tus. This fact was high­lighted by the district judge, to make the point that such de­cep­tion was dif­fi­cult to de­tect as it would take a con­sid­er­able length of time to get ver­i­fi­ca­tion from the for­eign aca­demic au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, de­fence coun­sel Mah­mood Gaz­navi said his client’s ac­tions were mo­ti­vated by his de­sire to be with his wife and first child, a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen, who was born in March 1997. So­hail sub­se­quently had two other chil­dren, who are also Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Mr Gaz­navi ar­gued that his client, who ran his own com­pany, did not rely on his PR sta­tus to seek em­ploy­ment or to ob­tain any ad­van­tage for his chil­dren. ICA will con­sider each case care­fully be­fore de­cid­ing whether to re­voke the PR sta­tus of a per­son con­victed of of­fences, a spokesman told The Straits Times.</p>
