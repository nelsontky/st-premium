    <p>Mr Mok ex­plored a dual-mass­ing con­cept with this pro­ject at the densely built-up neigh­bour­hood around Robin Road in Dis­trict 10.</p>
    <p>In ar­chi­tec­ture, “mass­ing” refers to a three-di­men­sional per­cep­tion of a build­ing, not just the out­line or shape of the struc­ture, and de­fines both the in­ner space and the ex­te­rior shape.</p>
    <p>The first three storeys of the devel­op­ment con­sists of a clus­ter of “house”-like struc­tures that look in­wards to a lush com­mu­nal space, in­stead of the neigh­bour­ing build­ings.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing above that, an open and trans­par­ent slab block al­lows the apart­ments to take in the views be­yond.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, most build­ings are aligned along a north-south ori­en­ta­tion, but do­ing so would have ob­structed views for this devel­op­ment. The apart­ment block was then placed in an east-west align­ment in­stead, although less de­sir­able in the trop­ics.</p>
    <p>Tim­ber-lou­vred slid­ing pan­els on the build­ing’s western fa­cade were added to mit­i­gate the sun’s im­pact and also im­part warmth and tex­tu­ral rich­ness.</p>
    <p>While work­ing with green­ery and so­lar ori­en­ta­tions would be called “Trop­i­cal Ar­chi­tec­ture”, Mr Mok says that this term is lim­it­ing.</p>
    <p>“The term has its lin­eage in the colo­nial­ists’ agenda for their trop­i­cal and sub­trop­i­cal out­posts, which has dom­i­nated the ar­chi­tec­tural dis­course of the re­gion,” says Mr Mok.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves the term has to­day mor­phed into some­thing big­ger – the pur­suit of green and sus­tain­able ar­chi­tec­ture. How­ever, un­less ap­proached holis­ti­cally, it can end up as yet an­other brand­ing ex­er­cise.</p>
