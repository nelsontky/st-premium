    <p>(Raniere’s) com­pany of­fered self-empowermen­t work­shops that were taken by Hol­ly­wood celebri­ties and busi­ness lead­ers. But un­der­neath the sur­face, Raniere was a pup­pet mas­ter con­trol­ling a cult-like crim­i­nal en­ter­prise... Some women in NXIVM were forced to have sex with Raniere and were even branded with his ini­tials in a se­cret cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Her voice trem­bling, the wit­ness, iden­ti­fied only as Camila, re­called on Tues­day the pre­cise date that she was sex­u­ally abused by Keith Raniere, leader of a self-im­prove­ment com­pany called NXIVM that pros­e­cu­tors have de­scribed as a sex cult.</p>
    <p>It was Sept 18, 2005, she said in her vic­tim state­ment. She was 15, and he was 45. He in­sisted, she said, that they both recog­nise the date as their an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship lasted 12 years, Camila said, with Raniere ex­pect­ing her to be avail­able for sex at all hours. He or­dered her to weigh less than 45kg and di­rected her to get an abor­tion. She said she tried to kill her­self once.</p>
    <p>“I want to move on, but he has dam­aged me in so many ways,” said Camila, who added that she was still hav­ing trou­ble fig­ur­ing out the line be­tween an abu­sive and a nor­mal re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Camila was the first of 15 vic­tims who gave state­ments at Raniere’s sen­tenc­ing on Tues­day, where he was given 120 years, ef­fec­tively life, in pri­son for sex traf­fick­ing and other crimes in a Brook­lyn court.</p>
    <p>Raniere, 60, had promised a path to hap­pi­ness, se­duc­ing suc­cess­ful and wealthy peo­ple in­clud­ing those who felt they lacked a higher pur­pose in life. His com­pany of­fered self-empowermen­t work­shops that were taken by Hol­ly­wood celebri­ties and busi­ness lead­ers.</p>
    <p>But un­der­neath the sur­face, Raniere was a pup­pet mas­ter con­trol­ling a cult-like crim­i­nal en­ter­prise, pros­e­cu­tors re­vealed at his trial last year.</p>
    <p>Some women in NXIVM were forced to have sex with Raniere and were even branded with his ini­tials in a se­cret cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Camila’s mother, brother and a sis­ter also spoke on Tues­day, telling</p>
    <p>the judge that Raniere de­stroyed their once close-knit fam­ily. Raniere had a sex­ual re­la­tion­ship with all three sis­ters in the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Another vic­tim, Ms India Ox­en­berg, told the court that Raniere tried to poi­son her re­la­tion­ship with her mother, ac­tress Cather­ine Ox­en­berg, whose ef­forts to ex­tri</p>
    <p>cate her daugh­ter from the or­gan­i­sa­tion were part of a re­cent HBO doc­u­men­tary se­ries about NXIVM, called The Vow.</p>
    <p>Ms India Ox­en­berg said Raniere ex­pected her to wait naked for him, like a piece of meat. She be­came so thin un­der his ma­nip­u­la­tion that she stopped get­ting her pe­riod, she said.</p>
    <p>“You are a sex­ual preda­tor, and you raped me,” Ms India Ox­en­berg said. “When you touched me, I re­coiled.”</p>
    <p>Raniere’s con­vic­tion last year capped a stun­ning down­fall for a man who was once idolised by his fol­low­ers, but has since been ex­posed as a fraud­ster who ex­ploited</p>
    <p>NXIVM’s ad­her­ents for money, sex and power.</p>
    <p>For­mer NXIVM mem­bers said Raniere and his in­ner cir­cle preyed on in­se­cure peo­ple who hoped that im­mers­ing them­selves in ex­pen­sive self-help classes would un­lock the key to ful­fil­ment.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a video­taped ini­ti­a­tion cer­e­mony, the women lay naked on a ta­ble, say­ing, “Mas­ter, please brand me”, as a cau­ter­is­ing pen seared their skin with­out anaes­the­sia.</p>
    <p>A jury con­victed Raniere in June last year af­ter a six-week trial.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors have said Raniere’s un­will­ing­ness to ac­cept re­spon­si­bil­ity and his con­tempt for his vic­tims demon­strated that a life sen­tence was the only way to stop him from hurt­ing more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>To this day, Raniere has many sup­port­ers who be­lieve he was wrong­fully con­victed.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, he has spear­headed a cam­paign to over­turn his con­vic­tion. He has di­rected his sup­port­ers to cre­ate a pod­cast about his case and set up a con­test to find er­rors in his pros­e­cu­tion in ex­change for a US$25,000 (S$34,000) cash prize, court fil­ings show.</p>
    <p>Over 18,000 peo­ple have taken NXIVM’s cour­ses in the United States, Mex­ico and Canada since it was founded in 1998.</p>
