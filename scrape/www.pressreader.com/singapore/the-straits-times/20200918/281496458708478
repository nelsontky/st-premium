    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP Raeesah Khan has been given a stern warn­ing for her com­ments on so­cial me­dia that pro­moted en­mity among dif­fer­ent groups and com­mit­ted con­tempt by scan­dal­is­ing the court, the po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion was made in con­sul­ta­tion with the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, the po­lice state­ment added.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Ms Raeesah, who is an MP for Sengkang GRC, apol­o­gised, and said her in­ten­tion was “never to cause so­cial un­rest or di­vi­sion”.</p>
    <p>She wrote: “I have spent most of my youth and adult life ad­vo­cat­ing, cam­paign­ing and or­gan­is­ing for mi­nor­ity causes, such as work­ing with fam­i­lies torn apart by in­car­cer­a­tion, peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and women who have gone through sex­ual as­sault.</p>
    <p>“In my pas­sion, I have said things in a man­ner that may have caused hurt to cer­tain com­mu­ni­ties. I apol­o­gise for this.”</p>
    <p>Ms Raeesah, 26, was part of the four-mem­ber WP team that won Sengkang GRC in the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion with 52.1 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>The po­lice warn­ing brings to an end the in­ves­ti­ga­tion that opened af­ter po­lice re­ports were lodged against Ms Raeesah on July 4 and 5 dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The re­ports were linked to two so­cial me­dia posts she had put up on Feb 2, 2018, and May 17 this year.</p>
    <p>Her May 17 post was about an</p>
    <p>in­ci­dent in Robert­son Quay in­volv­ing seven for­eign­ers who were caught on cam­era ig­nor­ing safe dis­tanc­ing rules dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In her post, Ms Raeesah had said: “Do you see po­lice of­fi­cers here? Imag­ine if this was a neigh­bour­hood hawker cen­tre. There would be po­lice­men swarm­ing the area and en­forc­ing the law within min­utes.</p>
    <p>“Why is the law dif­fer­ent for these peo­ple? Is it be­cause they are rich Chi­nese or white peo­ple? Do you think ex­pats will be treated with the same dis­dain as mi­grant work­ers who broke the law?”</p>
    <p>Ms Raeesah made an­other post in 2018, in the con­text of the City Har­vest Church rul­ing. In that post, she said: “Sin­ga­pore jails mi­nori­ties mer­ci­lessly, ha­rasses mosque lead­ers but lets cor­rupt church lead­ers who stole $50 mil­lion walk free. Who did they pay?”</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence on July 5 – af­ter it emerged that two po­lice re­ports had been made against her – Ms Raeesah said she re­gret­ted mak­ing “in­sen­si­tive” and “im­proper” re­marks, and apol­o­gised to those who may have been hurt by them.</p>
    <p>She also said she did not mean to cause so­cial di­vi­sion when she made the re­marks, but had in­stead wanted to raise aware­ness about the con­cerns of mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>In her Face­book post yes­ter­day, Ms Raeesah said she will con­tinue to learn and hopes to con­trib­ute to pos­i­tive change in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In her new role as an MP, she has met peo­ple from all walks of life, and has had hum­bling and in­sight­ful con­ver­sa­tions with res­i­dents, she added.</p>
    <p>She also said that these con­ver­sa­tions have given her an un­der­stand­ing of how every­one has an im­por­tant role to play in cre­at­ing a Sin­ga­pore that is eq­ui­table, j ust and com­pas­sion­ate.</p>
    <p>Ms Raeesah said: “From these in­ter­ac­tions, I have also learnt that as a leader, I have the power to start dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions, and that it is vi­tal to frame these con­ver­sa­tions in a con­sid­er­ate and ac­count­able man­ner.</p>
    <p>“As an MP, I hope to use the ap­pro­pri­ate plat­forms to speak out on mat­ters con­cern­ing my con­stituents.”</p>
    <p>She also thanked the pub­lic for their sup­port and un­der­stand­ing while the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions were go­ing on. “I am very grate­ful for it. I will do my best to pay it for­ward, and con­tinue to use my voice in Par­lia­ment to speak frankly and re­spon­si­bly on im­por­tant is­sues.”</p>
    <p>I have spent most of my youth and adult life ad­vo­cat­ing, cam­paign­ing and or­gan­is­ing for mi­nor­ity causes, such as work­ing with fam­i­lies torn apart by in­car­cer­a­tion, peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and women who have gone through sex­ual as­sault. In my pas­sion, I have said things in a man­ner that may have caused hurt to cer­tain com­mu­ni­ties. I apol­o­gise for this.</p>
