    <p>HONG KONG • China has ac­cused the United States of “gang­ster logic” af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump or­dered an end to Hong Kong’s spe­cial sta­tus un­der US law, in re­sponse to Bei­jing’s im­po­si­tion of new se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion on the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s Li­ai­son Of­fice in the Asian fi­nan­cial hub said the move would only dam­age US in­ter­ests, while hav­ing lit­tle im­pact on Hong Kong. “Un­rea­son­able med­dling and shame­less threats by the US are typ­i­cal gang­ster logic and bul­ly­ing be­hav­iour,” the of­fice said in a state­ment late on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Four mem­bers of a pro-es­tab­lish­ment party, the Demo­cratic Al­liance for the Bet­ter­ment and Progress of Hong Kong, staged a protest at the US con­sulate yes­ter­day, de­mand­ing that Wash­ing­ton “stop in­ter­fer­ing in Chi­nese in­ter­nal af­fairs”.</p>
    <p>This week, a younger, more de­fi­ant gen­er­a­tion of Hong Kong democrats se­cured the most votes in un­of­fi­cial pri­mary elec­tions in the city. The vote was or­gan­ised by the pro-democ­racy camp to pick can­di­dates for the Sept 6 elec­tion for the 70-seat Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil. Bei­jing warned that the vote may have vi­o­lated the new law.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, for­mer Hong Kong law­maker Au Nok Hin said he was pulling out as an or­gan­iser of last week­end’s vote amid Bei­jing’s ac­cu­sa­tions. Yes­ter­day, an­other or­gan­iser, Mr An­drew Chiu of the Demo­cratic Party, said his work was done and he would no longer help co­or­di­nate the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, po­lice ar­rested two male teenagers – a 17-year-old for un­law­ful as­sem­bly and a 19-yearold for ob­struct­ing po­lice on July 1, when hun­dreds were ar­rested in protests against the na­tional se­cu­rity law. Last week, po­lice ar­rested seven peo­ple for as­sist­ing the duo.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump on Tues­day signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der to end pref­er­en­tial eco­nomic treat­ment for Hong Kong, al­low­ing him to im­pose sanc­tions and visa re­stric­tions on Chi­nese of­fi­cials and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in­volved in the im­po­si­tion of the new law.</p>
    <p>China has threat­ened re­tal­ia­tory sanc­tions of its own and sum­moned the US am­bas­sador in protest.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment said on Wed­nes­day that it would sup­port any ac­tion Bei­jing chose to take against the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has not ruled out sanc­tions on top Chi­nese of­fi­cials to pun­ish China for its han­dling of Hong Kong, a White House Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil spokesman said on Wed­nes­day. Among the names be­ing pushed by some China hawks is Hong Kong leader Car­rie Lam, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
