    <p>Af­ter 162 years, Robin­sons, the grande dame of Sin­ga­pore’s depart­ment stores, will close its last store at Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter it shut­tered its Jem store in Jurong East in Au­gust last year and its 186,000 sq ft flag­ship store at The Heeren on Dec 16.</p>
    <p>Liq­uida­tor Kor­daMen­tha told The Straits Times that while the store’s last day will not be later than to­mor­row, op­er­a­tions may cease sooner if stocks run out.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish colo­nial-era depart­ment store sur­vived re­peated bomb­ings dur­ing the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion from 1942 to 1945 and was razed to the ground in a deadly 1972 fire.</p>
    <p>But it could not de­fend it­self against the rise and rise of on­line shop­ping and, fi­nally, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sto­ried depart­ment store’s demise has sober­ing lessons for other bricks-and-mor­tar re­tail­ers which de­pend on foot­fall and bank on the old-school no­tion of a phys­i­cal pres­ence in an e-com­merce world.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore shop­pers knew there was trou­ble brew­ing for Robin­sons, no­body ex­pected the culling to be so swift.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, other il­lus­tri­ous stores such as Lon­don’s Har­rods, which opened in 1849, and Paris’ Le Bon Marche (1852) are still thriv­ing and earn­ing mil­lions each year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ar­chi­tec­tural his­to­rian and an­thro­pol­o­gist Ju­lian Dav­i­son, the grande dames that have sur­vived till to­day have one thing in com­mon – a flag­ship store.</p>
    <p>“The last­ing suc­cess of old depart­ment stores, I think, in the cases of Le Bon Marche in Paris and Har­vey Ni­chols and Har­rods in Lon­don, is that it helps to have a re­ally good build­ing to serve as a kind of re­tail flag­ship,” says Dr Dav­i­son, 64, who has au­thored sev­eral books on Sin­ga­pore ar­chi­tec­ture, the lat­est of which is Swan & Ma­claren: A Story Of Sin­ga­pore Ar­chi­tec­ture (2020).</p>
    <p>“A highly recog­nis­able build­ing which is an ar­chi­tec­tural land­mark then be­comes a form of brand­ing for the en­ter­prise, and peo­ple are drawn to that sense of con­ti­nu­ity.”</p>
    <p>He says that in Robin­sons’ case, the brand lost its shine when the build­ing in Raf­fles Place burned down in 1972, “af­ter which it was just an­other re­tail out­let in a sea of more or less iden­ti­cal shop­ping com­plexes”.</p>
    <p>“Speak­ing as an ar­chi­tec­tural his­to­rian, I think the ‘build­ing as brand­ing’ is crit­i­cal,” he adds.</p>
    <p>WAX AND WANE</p>
    <p>Robin­sons started i n 1858 as Robin­son and Spicer, a part­ner­ship be­tween Mr Philip Robin­son, an English mer­chant who em­i­grated to Sin­ga­pore from Aus­tralia, and Mr James Ga­bo­riau Spicer, his Sin­ga­pore-based busi­ness part­ner.</p>
    <p>When Mr Spicer pulled out in 1859, Mr Robin­son en­tered into a new part­ner­ship and re­named the store Robin­son & Co, mov­ing to dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions sev­eral times over the years.</p>
    <p>In 1941, it fi­nally set­tled on a 24,000 sq ft build­ing at Raf­fles Cham­bers as its flag­ship, an ar­chi­tec­tural “honey trap” that was de­signed in 1910 to keep abreast of the lat­est re­tail trends of Bri­tain and Europe.</p>
    <p>“The bricks-and-mor­tar re­tail won­der­land en­ticed cus­tomers at the street level with huge plate­glass win­dows and wider walk­ways so that crowds could peek into the store and end up be­ing lured to spend,” says Dr Dav­i­son.</p>
    <p>At its essence, the in-store ex­pe­ri­ence was crafted to live up to the ex­pec­ta­tions of its grandiose fa­cade, de­signed by one of the most cel­e­brated Bri­tish ar­chi­tects in the re­gion, Re­gent Al­fred John Bid­well, who had com­pleted the Raf­fles Ho­tel in 1899 and the Vic­to­ria Me­mo­rial Hall in 1905.</p>
    <p>Mr Bid­well, who was a part­ner in Sin­ga­pore’s old­est ar­chi­tec­tural firm Swan & Ma­claren, had orig­i­nally de­signed the build­ing in 1910 as the flag­ship store for Katz Bros, Bri­tish pro­pri­etors who im­ported mer­chan­dise from Europe, the</p>
    <p>United States, In­dia, Aus­tralia and Ja­pan. It fea­tured a neo­clas­si­cal fa­cade with Corinthian col­umns and a 2.4m bronze statue of the Greek de­ity Mer­cury at its crown.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Katz Bros ex­ited the re­tail scene in the 1920s, Robin­son & Co took over the premises in 1941.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons quickly ex­panded from 1955, first ac­quir­ing John Lit­tle, Sin­ga­pore’s old­est re­tailer es­tab­lished in 1842; and snag­ging the fran­chise for Bri­tish re­tail brand Marks and Spencer in 1958.</p>
    <p>In 2008, Robin­son & Co Ltd, also known as the Robin­son Group of Com­pa­nies, was bought over by Dubai-based con­glom­er­ate AlFut­taim Group.</p>
    <p>In 2014, there were three Robin­sons stores in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing the one at Jem in Jurong East, and four John Lit­tle stores at Plaza Sin­ga­pura, Ma­rina Square, Tiong Bahru and Jurong Point.</p>
    <p>How­ever, by the end of 2016, the Al-Fut­taim Group had closed all John Lit­tle stores.</p>
    <p>On Oct 30 last year, Al-Fut­taim an­nounced its de­ci­sion to liq­ui­date Robin­sons’ last two stores at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre, cit­ing a range of fac­tors in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and astro­nom­i­cal costs.</p>
    <p>The news is “heart-break­ing” to Madam Letchimi Pu­rushota­man, who still can­not be­lieve the store will be shut­tered for good.</p>
    <p>The 91-year-old has vivid mem­o­ries of shop­ping at Robin­sons dur­ing the 1950s and 1960s, buy­ing lace table­cloths, bed­ding ma­te­rial and sil­ver­ware.</p>
    <p>“Shop­ping at the Raf­fles Place store was out of this world,” says</p>
    <p>Madam Pu­rushota­man, who to­day has four chil­dren, 10 grand­chil­dren and eight great-grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The up­mar­ket store had the am­bi­ence, ser­vice and Bri­tish mer­chan­dise you could not find any­where else in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“No­body went to the Robin­sons flag­ship store just to buy some­thing. You went there be­cause it was, sim­ply, Robin­sons.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially dur­ing Christ­mas, the whole store was trans­formed into a won­der­land, bring­ing to­gether Bri­tish shop­pers, Sin­ga­porean fam­i­lies and for­eign trav­ellers – all un­der one glo­ri­ous roof.”</p>
    <p>CRIT­I­CAL TO EN­GAGE THE CUS­TOMER</p>
    <p>For his­tory buff and her­itage blog­ger Jerome Lim, who re­mem­bers Robin­sons’ toy depart­ment in the lead-up to Christ­mas at the Raf­fles Cham­bers build­ing with fond­ness, it was a “less com­pli­cated” con­sumer mar­ket then.</p>
    <p>“While the re­tail scene now is one that is rather com­pli­cated and a tough en­vi­ron­ment to sur­vive in, I feel that Robin­sons could cer­tainly have been saved if it had de­vel­oped a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of its chang­ing cus­tomer base over the years and placed its fo­cus less on ex­clu­siv­ity, but on meet­ing the evolv­ing needs of its cus­tomers,” says the 56-year-old.</p>
    <p>Mr Markus Pe­sendor­fer of global ar­chi­tec­ture, de­sign, plan­ning and consulting firm Gensler says the thread­bare re­tail model of open­ing a store and hop­ing the mer­chan­dise will draw cus­tomers is an an­ti­quated one.</p>
    <p>To­day, it is crit­i­cal to en­gage the cus­tomer the mo­ment he or she en­ters the phys­i­cal store, says the 49-year-old, who is de­sign di­rec­tor and re­gional brand and re­tail ex­pe­ri­ence prac­tice leader at Gensler’s Sin­ga­pore branch.</p>
    <p>“It is not about look­ing at the re­tail en­vi­ron­ment from a land­lord, rev­enue and lo­gis­tics point of view such as price per square me­tre, de­liv­ery time or shelf life. It is about putting your­self in the shoes of the per­son vis­it­ing your space.”</p>
    <p>He cites Gensler’s re­cent Taobao Choice project in China as an ex­am­ple. “When our team de­signed the first off­line store for Taobao Choice in Hangzhou, we in­stalled bea­cons through­out the space to mon­i­tor peo­ple’s move­ments. Shop­pers can in­ter­act with a dig­i­tal sys­tem via touch­screens to se­lect and cus­tomise items, then scan with Ali­pay and leave with­out hav­ing to queue for pay­ment.”</p>
    <p>He says when the on­line busi­ness works seam­lessly with the off­line phys­i­cal store, both streams come un­der one rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of de­sign­ing spa­ces, we are de­sign­ing ex­pe­ri­ences,” he adds. This is done through con­sumer en­gage­ment such as un­der­stand­ing the clients’ busi­ness, the area sit­u­a­tion and trend pro­gres­sion over a cer­tain amount of time, so that Gensler is able to pro­gramme the space and give it rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>“The main shift is to change your point of view to the end-users’ per­spec­tives,” he stresses. “Ul­ti­mately, what we re­mem­ber is the ex­pe­ri­ence we had.”</p>
    <p>Ms Regina Yeo, ad­junct se­nior lec­turer of mar­ket­ing at the Na</p>
    <p>tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School, feels that un­like in the past, when shop­pers were loyal to a favourite brand or re­tailer, shop­pers to­day have a more tran­sient re­la­tion­ship with la­bels.</p>
    <p>“With the pop­u­lar­ity of on­line shop­ping, the buy­ing be­hav­iour of re­tail cus­tomers has evolved in re­cent years.”</p>
    <p>She be­lieves there was a per­cep­tion among younger shop­pers that Robin­sons ap­pealed more to an older co­hort or “their moth­ers’ gen­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>It also did not help that the mer­chan­dise failed to res­onate with mil­len­ni­als or Gen-Z con­sumers. “The Robin­sons brand­ing and mer­chan­dise mix lacked an emo­tional con­nec­tion with cus­tomers,” she adds.</p>
    <p>She ob­serves that in the past, Robin­sons used to mail vouch­ers which cus­tomers would dili­gently cut out and re­deem at the store.</p>
    <p>In an era of dig­i­tal apps and ere­wards, those phys­i­cal vouch­ers serve as a tan­gi­ble re­minder of the cus­tomer’s re­la­tion­ship with the store.</p>
    <p>“The hype of see­ing other shop­pers queue­ing cre­ates an un­spo­ken sense of kin­ship,” says Ms Yeo, adding that Le Bon Marche and Har­rods have been able to thrive be­cause these depart­ment stores are iconic with tourists.</p>
    <p>“It is not just about of­fer­ing good cus­tomer ser­vice and go­ing on­line these days. Brands need to con­stantly adapt to stay com­pet­i­tive and un­der­stand shop­pers’ buy­ing be­hav­iour to form emo­tional con­nec­tions with cus­tomers.”</p>
