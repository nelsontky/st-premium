    <p>•</p>
    <p>Bei­jing op­poses a forced sale of TikTok’s op­er­a­tions in the US by its Chi­nese owner ByteDance, and would pre­fer to see the video-shar­ing app shut down i n the coun­try, three sources with di­rect knowl­edge of the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>ByteDance has been in talks to sell TikTok’s business in the US to po­ten­tial buy­ers, in­clud­ing Mi­crosoft and Or­a­cle, since US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump threat­ened last month to ban the ser­vice if it was not sold.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has given ByteDance a dead­line of mid-Septem­ber to fi­nalise a deal.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Chi­nese of­fi­cials be­lieve a forced sale would make both ByteDance and China ap­pear weak in the face of pres­sure from Wash­ing­ton, the sources said on Fri­day, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>ByteDance said in a state­ment to Reuters that the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment had never sug­gested to the com­pany that it should shut down TikTok in the US or in any other mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Two of the sources said China was will­ing to use re­vi­sions it made to a tech­nol­ogy ex­ports list on Aug 28 to de­lay any deal reached by ByteDance, if it had to.</p>
    <p>China’s State Coun­cil In­for­ma­tion Of­fice and its for­eign and com­merce min­istries did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Asked on Fri­day about Mr Trump and TikTok, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a reg­u­lar press brief­ing that the US was abus­ing the con­cept of na­tional se­cu­rity, and urged it to stop op­press­ing for­eign com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Reuters has re­ported that TikTok’s prospec­tive buy­ers were dis­cussing four ways to struc­ture an ac­qui­si­tion from ByteDance.</p>
    <p>Within th­ese, the com­pany could still push ahead with a sale of TikTok’s US as­sets with­out ap­proval from China’s Com­merce Min­istry by sell­ing them with­out key al­go­rithms.</p>
    <p>ByteDance and its founder Zhang Yim­ing have been caught in a clash be­tween the world’s two pre-em­i­nent pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump last month is­sued two ex­ec­u­tive or­ders that re­quire ByteDance to sell TikTok’s as­sets in the US or face be­ing banned in the coun­try, where the app is im­mensely pop­u­lar among teenagers.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials have crit­i­cised the app’s se­cu­rity and pri­vacy, sug­gest­ing that user data might be shared with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>TikTok has said it would not com­ply with any re­quest to share user data with the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has said it firmly op­poses Mr Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­ders and, on Aug 28, moved to give it­self a say in the process, re­vis­ing a list of tech­nolo­gies that will need Chi­nese gov­ern­ment ap­proval be­fore they are ex­ported.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said TikTok’s rec­om­men­da­tion al­go­rithm would fall un­der this list.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors said re­cently that the rules were not tar­geted at spe­cific com­pa­nies, but they reaf­firmed their right to en­force them.</p>
