    <p>A new rule ban­ning the sale of liquor at cer­tain types of gro­cers in Kuala Lumpur from next year has ig­nited a de­bate on the lib­er­ties and rights en­joyed by non-Mus­lims, who make up more than onethird of Malaysia’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) last week an­nounced new guide­lines for liquor li­cences in the cap­i­tal, in which sundry shops, con­ve­nience stores and Chi­nese medicine stores are banned from sell­ing hard liquor on their premises be­gin­ning on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>The hours stip­u­lated for sell­ing beer on these premises will also be short­ened, and will be un­til only 9pm ev­ery day. Hyper­mar­kets, su­per­mar­kets, restau­rants and pubs are al­lowed to sell liquor within their ex­ist­ing op­er­at­ing hours.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers and civil so­ci­ety mem­bers have de­scribed the ban as a vi­o­la­tion of non-Mus­lims’ free­dom to prac­tise their cul­ture, which is pro­vided for by the Fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The Kuala Lumpur chap­ter of the op­po­si­tion Demo­cratic Ac­tion</p>
    <p>Party (DAP) last week asked for the ban to be re­scinded, point­ing out that the cur­rent busi­ness op­er­at­ing model at sundry shops has been in place for more than 50 years.</p>
    <p>“We will ar­range a meet­ing with the mayor and de­mand DBKL re­tract this un­fair and un­rea­son­able rul­ing,” DAP’s KL chief Tan Kok Wai said in a state­ment in Man­darin, adding that the party will gather views and ob­jec­tions from rel­e­vant stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor and Kuala Lumpur Wine and Spirit Chi­nese Deal­ers As­so­ci­a­tion sec­re­tary Al­bert Chooi, in a re­port in Free Malaysia To­day, es­ti­mated that the rul­ing would af­fect some 300 sundry shops, medicine shops and con­ve­nience stores.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing has also come up against strong op­po­si­tion from mil­i­tary vet­er­ans, es­pe­cially af­ter Deputy Re­li­gious Af­fairs Min­is­ter Ah­mad Marzuk Shaary, a mem­ber of the Is­lamic party PAS, sug­gested the liquor ban could be ex­tended be­yond Kuala Lumpur to other states.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary vet­er­ans group Per­sat­uan Pa­triot Ke­bangsaan (Pa­triot) pres­i­dent Bri­gadier-Gen­eral Mo­hamed Ar­shad Raji called the move “un­nec­es­sary and ridicu­lous”.</p>
    <p>“If curb­ing of liquor sales is be­cause of drink driv­ing, there are bet­ter ways to tackle the prob­lem,” Datuk Ar­shad said in a state­ment on Sun­day, adding that any de­ci­sion should in­clude con­sul­ta­tion with the busi­ness com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>For­mer Malaysian army chief</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Hashim Mohd Ali, pres­i­dent of the Chiefs Cir­cle, which is made up of re­tired army chiefs, also crit­i­cised the move, say­ing there are no stud­ies link­ing liquor sales in such out­lets to the drink driv­ing in­ci­dents in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The last thing our econ­omy</p>
    <p>needs in this or the post-pan­demic pe­riod is fur­ther curbs on le­git­i­mate busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties,” Tan Sri Hashim said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ha­nipa Maidin, an op­po­si­tion law­maker from Parti Amanah Ne­gara and a for­mer deputy min­is­ter, la­belled the move as un­con­sti­tu­tional. “Such a to­tal pro­hi­bi­tion would def­i­nitely have a tremen­dous ef­fect of ren­der­ing the ex­er­cise of non-Mus­lims’ right to prac­tise their own re­li­gion as a mock­ery and il­lu­sory. Hence, it is un­con­sti­tu­tional. Pe­riod,” Mr Ha­nipa said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>City Hall pre­vi­ously froze the is­suance of new liquor li­cences pend­ing new li­cence reg­u­la­tions, fol­low­ing a rise in drink driv­ing ac­ci­dents in Malaysia this year. This had al­ready led to stiffer penal­ties for drink driv­ing.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries Min­is­ter An­nuar Musa, who pre­vi­ously cited drink driv­ing in­ci­dents as rea­sons to freeze the liquor li­cences, de­fended the move as “not un­usual”, cit­ing re­stric­tions in sell­ing liquor in sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries as well as in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri An­nuar said the move is de­signed to reg­u­late the sale of liquor fol­low­ing public com­plaints that il­le­gal liquor and liquor in small pack­ets are be­ing sold in some sundry shops and mini mar­ket chains.</p>
    <p>“There are also those who sell liquor to mi­nors and school stu­dents as it is eas­ily avail­able ev­ery­where,” na­tional news agency Ber­nama re­ported him as say­ing.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment re­cently amended fed­eral laws to in­clude manda­tory jail sen­tences for drunk driv­ers who cause deaths.</p>
