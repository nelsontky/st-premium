    <p>More wealthy peo­ple are set­ting up char­i­ta­ble funds that give at least six-fig­ure sums to their cho­sen causes. There were 143 donor-ad­vised funds set up with the Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore, dis­burs­ing $20.2 mil­lion to char­i­ta­ble causes in the foun­da­tion’s fi­nan­cial year that ended in March.</p>
    <p>More wealthy peo­ple are set­ting up char­i­ta­ble funds that give at least six-fig­ure sums to their cho­sen causes.</p>
    <p>There were 143 donor-ad­vised funds set up with the Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore (CFS), dis­burs­ing $20.2 mil­lion to char­i­ta­ble causes in the foun­da­tion’s fi­nan­cial year that ended in March.</p>
    <p>This is dou­ble the 70 funds that gave out $11.7 mil­lion in the fi­nan­cial year that ended in March 2015.</p>
    <p>Donors pledge at least $200,000 to set up a donor-ad­vised fund with the non-profit CFS, which man­ages the money, ad­vises donors on var­i­ous needs in the com­mu­nity and dis­burses the funds ac­cord­ing to the donors’ wishes.</p>
    <p>CFS chief ex­ec­u­tive Cather­ine Loh told The Straits Times there is a greater aware­ness of its work and greater pref­er­ence for donor-ad­vised funds, which al­low donors to give in a more in­formed, struc­tured and sus­tained man­ner over time. Donors can also name their funds.</p>
    <p>The do­nated sum can be held at the foun­da­tion in per­pe­tu­ity and in­vested, with in­vested re­turns go­ing to the char­i­ta­ble causes over time.</p>
    <p>Ms Loh said more peo­ple are also set­ting up legacy funds, like those in mem­ory of a late loved one, adding to the rise in donor-ad­vised funds. Donors may also set up a fund to be dis­bursed af­ter their deaths.</p>
    <p>So far, the largest sum do­nated to start a fund has been $24 mil­lion, set up by a fam­ily in their late fa­ther’s name, Ms Loh said, without giv­ing more de­tails.</p>
    <p>She noted that such funds have been es­pe­cially needed dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, when more peo­ple are in need and many char­i­ties say do­na­tions are fall­ing.</p>
    <p>Since Fe­bru­ary, CFS donor-ad­vised funds have given out about $1.2 mil­lion to Covid 19-re­lated causes, such as top­ping up phone cards for mi­grant work­ers and buy­ing masks for char­i­ties car­ing for se­niors.</p>
    <p>Many donor-ad­vised funds, how­ever, are set up to give to spe­cific causes that donors and their fam­i­lies care about.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Mr Lien Ber Luen gave $200,000 to set up the Lien Shih Sheng Foun­da­tion in 2018 in mem­ory of his grand­fa­ther, who had been ed­i­tor-in-chief of Chi­nese-lan­guage news­pa­per Nanyang Siang Pau.</p>
    <p>Mr Lien Shih Sheng was a lit­er­ary pioneer here and was in­volved in many arts, ed­u­ca­tion and cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties, his grand­son said.</p>
    <p>The Lien Shih Sheng Foun­da­tion has funded schol­ar­ships at Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion for chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies and will sup­port a new pro­gramme to give fi­nan­cial aid to help chil­dren from un­der­priv­i­leged fam­i­lies at­tend pre-school reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>Mr Lien, who is in his 40s, works at a lo­cal as­set man­age­ment firm and is mar­ried with two chil­dren, said: “He was a dot­ing grand­fa­ther and a role model for me. I set up this fund to re­mem­ber him and to con­tinue his legacy of con­tribut­ing to the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>More than half of the funds at the CFS were set up by donors aged be­tween 40 and 60, rang­ing from work­ing pro­fes­sion­als to those with in­her­ited wealth, Ms Loh said.</p>
    <p>While sup­port­ing ed­u­ca­tion and help­ing the sick and the poor are ev­er­green favourites, causes re­lat­ing to en­vi­ron­men­tal and sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues are also be­com­ing more pop­u­lar. Donors are also more savvy now.</p>
    <p>Ms Loh said: “We have seen donors ask­ing more ques­tions and mov­ing away from just cheque­book phi­lan­thropy over the years.”</p>
    <p>These donors are keen to un­der­stand the root causes of so­cial prob­lems and find ways to tackle them, in­stead of sim­ply hand­ing over their money.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the CFS, the SymAsia Foun­da­tion, es­tab­lished by pri­vate bank Credit Suisse for its clients, also of­fers donor-ad­vised funds.</p>
    <p>It did not re­veal the num­ber of such funds, but said its clients “typ­i­cally make a com­mit­ment of $1 mil­lion for do­na­tions”.</p>
    <p>Ms Young Jin Yee, SymAsia Foun­da­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive, said: “I would say no other cause has brought our donors to­gether like the cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>She said about a third of its donors from the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion have stepped up to al­le­vi­ate the dif­fi­cul­ties brought about by the virus.</p>
    <p>The donors’ ac­tions in­clude giv­ing fi­nan­cial aid to stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore whose fam­i­lies were af­fected by Covid-19 and sup­port­ing the de­vel­op­ment of a vac­cine for the coro­n­avirus be­ing jointly de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and an Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm.</p>
