    <p>SRINAGAR (Kash­mir) • Votes are be­ing counted af­ter the first lo­cal elec­tions in Kash­mir since the In­dian gov­ern­ment waged a harsh po­lit­i­cal and se­cu­rity crack­down in the restive re­gion last year.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials on Tues­day hailed a solid turnout as a sign that democ­racy has been re­stored, but lit­tle in Kash­mir feels nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“The vot­ing shows democ­racy be­ing alive at the grass­roots,” the re­gion’s top civil ser­vant, Mr B.V.R. Subrah­manyam, told a group of re­porters. “Peo­ple tak­ing value of their own lives is vis­i­ble, pal­pa­ble.”</p>
    <p>The elec­tion – a vote to choose ru­ral devel­op­ment of­fi­cials – was called sud­denly, giv­ing par­ties only a week to reg­is­ter can­di­dates be­fore the first round of the eight-phase polling be­gan last month, po­lit­i­cal lead­ers said.</p>
    <p>Many prom­i­nent Kash­miri politi­cians and pub­lic fig­ures re­main i n de­ten­tion with no re­course, or un­der threat.</p>
    <p>And hun­dreds of thou­sands of po­lit­i­cal work­ers for In­dia’s Hindu-na­tion­al­ist rul­ing party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), trav­elled through the re­gion car­ry­ing ban­ners and signs, hop­ing to make a strong show­ing in a mostly Mus­lim ter­ri­tory where it has tra­di­tion­ally been loathed.</p>
    <p>The party did ap­pear to make some in­roads, win­ning at least three seats and lead­ing in sev­eral dozen races in the 280-seat Dis­trict Devel­op­ment Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>But some of the voter en­gage­ment ap­peared to stem more from de­fi­ance than sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’d never want the BJP to be in power in Kash­mir,” said Ms Kul­soom Chopan, 21, while wait­ing to vote in Bandi­pora, a north­ern dis­trict. “We would never vote for In­dia.”</p>
    <p>This rel­a­tively small-stakes elec­tion was the first time that In­dia has al­lowed for­eign re­porters into Jammu and Kash­mir since Au­gust last year, when Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s gov­ern­ment re­voked the con­sti­tu­tional pro­vi­sion that gave the re­gion some po­lit­i­cal au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists say hun­dreds of peo­ple, in­clud­ing sep­a­ratists, po­lit­i­cal mod­er­ates, civil so­ci­ety ad­vo­cates and jour­nal­ists, re­main in jail af­ter they were swept up last year.</p>
