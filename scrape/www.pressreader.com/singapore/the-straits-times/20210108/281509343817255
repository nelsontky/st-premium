    <p>To­tal share buy­back trans­ac­tions for last year amounted to $1.03 bil­lion, with 100 pri­mary-listed stocks con­duct­ing buy­backs, said the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change. While the num­ber of com­pa­nies con­duct­ing buy­backs was up by 20 per cent, the full year’s con­sid­er­a­tion rep­re­sents a 75 per cent in­crease from $590 mil­lion in 2019.</p>
    <p>To­tal share buy­back trans­ac­tions for last year amounted to $1.03 bil­lion, with 100 pri­mary-listed stocks con­duct­ing buy­backs, said the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) in a mar­ket up­date.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of com­pa­nies con­duct­ing buy­backs was up 20 per cent, the full year’s con­sid­er­a­tion rep­re­sents a 75 per cent in­crease from $590 mil­lion in 2019.</p>
    <p>Mo­ti­va­tions for share buy­backs can in­clude em­ployee com­pen­sa­tion plans, such as share op­tion schemes or em­ployee share pur­chase plans, or long-term cap­i­tal man­age­ment, noted SGX in its re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Buy­backs can also pick up amid mar­ket de­clines that are driven by broader moves on in­ter­na­tional macroe­co­nomic de­vel­op­ments, it added.</p>
    <p>The 2020 buy­back con­sid­er­a­tion was led by Straits Times In­dex (STI) stocks DBS Group Hold­ings, Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional, OverseaChi­nese Bank­ing Cor­po­ra­tion, Yangz­i­jiang Ship­build­ing and Sin­ga­pore Tech­nolo­gies En­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>This was largely sim­i­lar to the year be­fore, with Wil­mar be­ing the sole ex­cep­tion as it re­placed Kep­pel Reit among the top five list for 2020.</p>
    <p>No­tably, Wil­mar bought back some 11.3 mil­lion of its shares for $48.1 mil­lion between Dec 1 and 29 last year, at an av­er­age price of $4.27 per share.</p>
    <p>This took the to­tal num­ber of shares that Wil­mar bought back on the cur­rent man­date dur­ing the 2020 cal­en­dar year to 44.7 mil­lion shares, rep­re­sent­ing 0.7 per cent of its is­sued shares.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, Wil­mar had not bought back shares since Au­gust 2016.</p>
    <p>SGX also high­lighted a cur­rent val­u­a­tion gap between Wil­mar and its Shenzhen-listed sub­sidiary Yi­hai Kerry Arawana, which has a price-to-earn­ings ra­tio of 115 times com­pared with Wil­mar’s price-toearn­ings ra­tio of 17 times.</p>
    <p>To­gether, the 20 stocks that filed the high­est buy­back con­sid­er­a­tions through­out last year ac­counted for 94 per cent of the en­tire sum of $1.03 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>To­tal share buy­back con­sid­er­a­tion for De­cem­ber last year to­talled $114.4 mil­lion, down from $174.2 mil­lion in Novem­ber, but up from the $70.1 mil­lion re­ported for De­cem­ber 2019.</p>
    <p>The STI gained 1.3 per cent last De­cem­ber, tak­ing the de­cline in the bench­mark in­dex’s to­tal re­turn to 8.1 per cent for 2020, com­pared to a 9.4 per cent gain in the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>Share buy­back trans­ac­tions in­volve share is­suers re­pur­chas­ing some of their out­stand­ing stocks from share­hold­ers through the open mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Once the shares are bought back, they can be con­verted into trea­sury shares, which means they are no longer cat­e­gorised as shares out­stand­ing.</p>
