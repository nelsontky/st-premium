    <p>A vac­cine cre­ated by Pfizer and part­ner BioNTech won the race to prove ef­fi­cacy in a large trial.</p>
    <p>But is it the best vac­cine of the dozens be­ing tested?</p>
    <p>If it isn’t, will any slower but bet­ter vac­cines have a chance?</p>
    <p>A press state­ment this week says the vac­cine is 90 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing symp­to­matic Covid-19. That would mean nearly all of those in­fec­tions hap­pened in peo­ple who got a placebo rather than the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The trial is not over. It was slated to stop af­ter 164 peo­ple of the 44,000 vol­un­teers de­vel­oped symp­toms and tested pos­i­tive for the virus, but an in­de­pen­dent board was al­lowed to peek at the data early. They waited un­til there were up to 94 in­fec­tions to share the pre­lim­i­nary news.</p>
    <p>As promis­ing as the an­nounce­ment sounded, a crit­i­cal ques­tion was not an­swered: Does the vac­cine pre­vent peo­ple from get­ting the in­fec­tion and spread­ing it to oth­ers, or merely pre­vent symp­toms?</p>
    <p>In ex­per­i­ments in which an­i­mals were de­lib­er­ately ex­posed, some vac­cine can­di­dates did pre­vent in­fec­tion, while oth­ers did not.</p>
    <p>That makes an enor­mous dif­fer­ence, since vac­cines are usu­ally least likely to work in those who need them most – peo­ple whose im­mune sys­tems are not work­ing cor­rectly be­cause of their age or health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine that pre­vents younger, health­ier peo­ple from trans­mit­ting the dis­ease would save more lives by in­di­rectly pro­tect­ing those peo­ple through herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Safety will mat­ter too. Peo­ple might not agree to get a vac­cine if there is even a per­cep­tion of se­ri­ous side ef­fects or in­com­plete safety test­ing.</p>
    <p>This cre­ates a big eth­i­cal puz­zle. Af­ter it is clear a drug or vac­cine is work­ing, it is tra­di­tion­ally con­sid­ered un­eth­i­cal to con­tinue to give clin­i­cal trial vol­un­teers a placebo. An­other unan­swered ques­tion is whether it will be pos­si­ble to con­tinue clin­i­cal tri­als of other vac­cines. And if one later treat­ment proves bet­ter than the front run­ner, will it be safe to use it on peo­ple who have al­ready had a vac­cine with more mod­est ben­e­fits?</p>
    <p>“The big dis­cus­sion now is how we make the vac­cine avail­able with­out los­ing the data we need,” says im­mu­nol­o­gist Flo­rian Kram­mer of the Ic­ahn School of Medicine at Mount Si­nai.</p>
    <p>How sci­en­tists solve that prob­lem will de­ter­mine when a vac­cine is ready to be rolled out.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore full-scale ap­proval, the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion can fast-track vac­cines through emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion (EUA), which could be is­sued for the Pfizer vac­cine be­fore the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Har­vard re­searcher Dan Barouch, the co-cre­ator of a dif­fer­ent vac­cine be­ing man­u­fac­tured by John­son & John­son and be­ing tested in 60,000 peo­ple, says: “What’s be­ing dis­cussed now is whether an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion of the first vac­cines will make it more dif­fi­cult for other vac­cines to com­plete clin­i­cal tri­als.”</p>
    <p>On the one hand, an EUA could pre­vent thou­sands of deaths.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, even more deaths could be pre­vented over the long haul by gath­er­ing enough data to get the safest, most ef­fec­tive vac­cines out there.</p>
    <p>Pfizer’s front-run­ner vac­cine is one of two lead­ing can­di­dates based on a new tech­nol­ogy that uses mes­sen­ger RNA – a nu­cleic acid, like DNA. It sounds a lot scarier than it is, say the ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The RNA can­not af­fect the genes in your cells. And its ef­fect on the body is min­i­mal com­pared with get­ting the virus.</p>
    <p>An in­fec­tion hi­jacks all your cel­lu­lar ma­chin­ery and re­pur­poses it to­wards mak­ing more virus, while the RNA would prompt cells to make one small part of the virus, stim­u­lat­ing the im­mune sys­tem to cre­ate an­ti­bod­ies that will at­tach to the real thing if it is en­coun­tered.</p>
    <p>Rheuma­tol­o­gist Arthur Krieg is not wor­ried the un­prece­dented speed would hurt a vac­cine’s safety. “What they changed was to dra­mat­i­cally ac­cel­er­ate the re­view and de­ci­sion-mak­ing process, al­low­ing tri­als to go much more rapidly than they nor­mally would,” he says. “But we’re not re­ally mak­ing a sac­ri­fice in safety as far as I can see.”</p>
    <p>In past vac­cine tri­als, most side ef­fects oc­curred within the first two months of par­tic­i­pants get­ting the shots, and most within the first two weeks, Dr Krieg says. Pfizer should have that safety data by the third week of this month, when they have two months of follow-up on at least half of the par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Still, the whole vac­cine quest could be de­railed by even the per­cep­tion of dan­ger. Once enough peo­ple are get­ting a vac­cine, some will in­evitably get var­i­ous se­vere ill­nesses for rea­sons that have noth­ing to do with the vac­cine. The scare that wrongly as­so­ci­ated autism with child­hood vac­cines came about that way.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Kram­mer says he has high hopes that a vac­cine could end the pan­demic, even though he thinks it is un­likely to erad­i­cate the virus. What he ex­pects is that even­tu­ally a vac­cine will make Covid-19 milder and less com­mon.</p>
    <p>This week’s news is promis­ing for other vac­cines. One be­ing de­vel­oped by Moderna also uses mes­sen­ger RNA, and most of the oth­ers are, in one way or an­other, aimed at pro­duc­ing an­ti­bod­ies to the so-called spike pro­tein, which the virus uses to get into cells.</p>
    <p>Eleven vac­cine can­di­dates are in late-stage test­ing and a num­ber of other promis­ing vac­cines are not far be­hind. It is an abun­dance that has never hap­pened in the his­tory of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Bal­anc­ing ur­gency with re­search ethics and the longer-term need for data will not be easy. But so much rides on get­ting it right.</p>
