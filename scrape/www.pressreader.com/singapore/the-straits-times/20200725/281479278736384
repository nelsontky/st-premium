    <p>Ms Greta Su­san d’Rozario is 86 and she re­cently com­pleted two video­call con­sul­ta­tions with her doc­tors last month.</p>
    <p>Her ver­dict? She said there was “not much” dif­fer­ence be­tween see­ing her doc­tor in per­son and on­line.</p>
    <p>Ms d’Rozario, who has mild cog­ni­tive im­pair­ment, di­a­betes, high choles­terol, hy­per­ten­sion and gout, met her doc­tor on­line for her reg­u­lar fol­low-up ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Her niece-in-law, Mrs Au­drey Wee, 71, who had helped her at­tend the on­line ses­sion with Dr Alexan­der Yip at Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal (AH), said: “Dr Alex wanted to see how her gout is and she... showed him her knees and he was sat­is­fied that there’s no flare-up.</p>
    <p>“I think it works some­how... It also de­pends on the type of ill­ness you have.”</p>
    <p>And now, Ms d’Rozario is happy to con­tinue with the on­line ses­sions, as it al­lows her to avoid go­ing to the hos­pi­tal in this Covid-19 pan­demic. The med­i­ca­tion that she needs is sent straight to her home.</p>
    <p>The con­ve­nience is also what Mrs Wee ap­pre­ci­ates. It used to take her a whole day to ac­com­pany her aunt-in-law, who lives alone, to the hos­pi­tal as she had to travel from her place in the east to Ms d’Rozario’s place in the south-west of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Telemedici­ne has taken off in a big way here – and around the world – thanks to the Covid-19 pan­demic, as more pa­tients are will­ing to con­sult their doc­tors over video calls in­stead of in per­son.</p>
    <p>Home-grown telemedici­ne apps like Doc­tor Any­where and WhiteCoat have re­ported spikes in us­age.</p>
    <p>These apps were mostly started in the past few years. It was mainly the gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers who were us­ing them to see pa­tients who may have mi­nor ail­ments such as the com­mon cold and acute gastroente­ritis.</p>
    <p>Now, with Covid-19 in the pic­ture, more doc­tors, in­clud­ing spe­cial­ists, are us­ing telemedici­ne to see a grow­ing group of pa­tients – and it can be a pa­tient with anx­i­ety, or a chronic con­di­tion like hy­per­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Eye Cen­tre also started us­ing it for its sta­ble glau­coma pa­tients dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Those do­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion work may also use telemedici­ne or tel­ere­ha­bil­i­ta­tion at hos­pi­tals like AH and Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (CGH).</p>
    <p>In June, CGH launched this for ser­vices like geri­atric oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy, speech ther­apy and phys­io­ther­apy, while Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal, for in­stance, now of­fers tel­ere­ha­bil­i­ta­tion for speech ther­apy and phys­io­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>CHANGE IN PA­TIENTS’ MIND­SET</p>
    <p>The mind­set of pa­tients changed with Covid-19, so the take-up of telemedici­ne ac­tu­ally ac­cel­er­ated. The sec­ond thing is that hos­pi­tal ad­min­is­tra­tors are now more</p>
    <p>’’ re­cep­tive to telemedici­ne.</p>
    <p>DR LEE CHUN TSU, Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal’s co-lead in vCare and as­so­ciate con­sul­tant of the hos­pi­tal’s chronic pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee Chun Tsu, AH’s co-lead in vCare and as­so­ciate con­sul­tant of AH’s chronic pro­gramme, said that the hos­pi­tal started plan­ning for telemedici­ne, tar­geted at pa­tients with com­plex chronic med­i­cal con­di­tions, at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>AH’s vCare pro­gramme pi­loted on Feb 20 with just five pa­tients try­ing out video con­sul­ta­tions for the first time, but by June, the num­ber of new cases had shot up to 133.</p>
    <p>“The mind­set of pa­tients changed with Covid-19, so the take-up of telemedici­ne ac­tu­ally ac­cel­er­ated. The sec­ond thing is that hos­pi­tal ad­min­is­tra­tors are now more re­cep­tive to telemedici­ne,” Dr Lee said.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lee Chien Earn, SingHealth’s deputy group chief ex­ec­u­tive (re­gional health sys­tem), said that the health clus­ter’s in­sti­tu­tions have been ramp­ing up ex­ist­ing telemedici­ne ser­vices and in­tro­duc­ing new ones to en­sure pa­tients con­tinue to re­ceive the nec­es­sary care with­out hav­ing to make fre­quent trips to the hos­pi­tal dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, so­cial ser­vice agency Li­ons Be­frien­ders Ser­vice As­so­ci­a­tion started work­ing with var­i­ous pub­lic hos­pi­tals in an ef­fort to help 6,000 seniors in rental flats ac­cess telemedici­ne ser­vices from next month, said Ms Karen Wee, the agency’s deputy ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>These can be fol­low-up con­sul­ta­tions for chronic con­di­tions and al­lied health ser­vices such as phys­io­ther­apy, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>The telemedici­ne push here re­ceived a boost when, in early April, the Gov­ern­ment al­lowed pa­tients to tap their Com­mu­nity Health As­sist Scheme or Chas cards and Medis­ave sav­ings to pay for video con­sul­ta­tions for seven chronic con­di­tions, in­clud­ing di­a­betes, hy­per­ten­sion and lipid dis­or­der, and four men­tal health con­di­tions, like schizophre­nia and anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>This will al­low pa­tients whose con­di­tions are sta­ble to avoid a phys­i­cal visit to the clinic dur­ing this pe­riod of height­ened alert due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“It’s essen­tially a chang­ing of the times, right? The great­est crit­i­cism of telemedici­ne has al­ways been the de-per­son­al­i­sa­tion of the pa­tient-provider ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“But this at­tribute in this cur­rent Covid sit­u­a­tion is its great­est as­set,” said Dr Yip, who is also the clin­i­cal di­rec­tor of health­care tech­nol­ogy at AH.</p>
    <p>Dr Lee said telemedici­ne is used only for later con­sul­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“In the first clin­i­cal con­sul­ta­tion, we meet the pa­tient and their fam­ily in per­son and to build rap­port. Also, as part of the med­i­cal as­sess­ment, we per­form a full phys­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion, which we can’t do if this is a video con­sul­ta­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Telemedici­ne, how­ever, does have its de­trac­tors, whose var­i­ous con­cerns in­clude those re­lat­ing to pri­vacy and data se­cu­rity, and also that a se­vere con­di­tion can be eas­ily missed.</p>
    <p>In a May letter to the Straits Times Fo­rum page, Dr Si­toh Yih Yiow, a geri­a­tri­cian, cau­tioned against the un­bri­dled pro­mo­tion of telemedici­ne in the care of older peo­ple, who are vul­ner­a­ble to pre­cip­i­tous de­clines in their health, re­quire close mon­i­tor­ing, and of­ten have atyp­i­cal fea­tures when sick.</p>
    <p>He said pa­tients of­ten as­sume that tech­nolo­gies such as telemedici­ne may safely sub­sti­tute for in-per­son con­sul­ta­tions, but a per­son re­port­ing symp­toms sug­ges­tive of a “sim­ple” uri­nary tract in­fec­tion via a video call may in fact be cold and clammy and in dan­ger of im­pend­ing septic shock.</p>
    <p>He also said there is a need for the au­thor­i­ties to clar­ify the medico-le­gal re­spon­si­bil­ity of doc­tors who choose to di­ag­nose and treat pa­tients through telemedici­ne.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Yung Khan, a urol­o­gist in pri­vate prac­tice, who prefers to use telemedici­ne for fol­low-up con­sul­ta­tions and not to see new pa­tients, said: “Doc­tors di­ag­nose with all the senses. We need a good his­tory, hear the pa­tients’ lungs and heart, touch them to as­sess pain and move­ment. Smell comes in too.”</p>
    <p>A phys­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion helps doc­tors to or­der ap­pro­pri­ate tests. In the ab­sence of one, doc­tors will have to rely on more imag­ing tests.</p>
    <p>“This may in­ad­ver­tently lead to a higher cost for pa­tients. Doc­tors may want to prac­tise more de­fen­sive medicine, es­pe­cially since the new sen­tenc­ing guide­lines for doc­tors seem a bit harsh,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>A com­mit­tee set up last year to im­prove the dis­ci­plinary process of the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil on July 15 is­sued sen­tenc­ing guide­lines for er­rant doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Also, pa­tients will need to be fairly com­fort­able with tech­nol­ogy – plus have an In­ter­net con­nec­tion – to em­brace telemedici­ne.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has clearly has­tened the adop­tion of telemedici­ne as an ac­cept­able mode of care. While treat­ing pa­tients from a dis­tance has its chal­lenges and needs to be han­dled with care, it ap­pears to point to the way for­ward.</p>
    <p>Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal’s vCare pro­gramme pi­loted on</p>
    <p>Feb 20 with just five pa­tients try­ing out video con­sul­ta­tions for the first time, but by June, the num­ber of new cases had shot up to 133.</p>
