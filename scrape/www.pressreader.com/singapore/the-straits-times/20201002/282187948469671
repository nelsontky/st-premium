    <p>Ear­lier this week, I read of Bri­tain’s “top di­vorce lawyer” who tells her staff on ma­ter­nity leave to “come back as soon as you can, but come back at what­ever pace you like: for half a day a week, for a day a week”.</p>
    <p>If I had a baby now, I would not go full-time moth­er­ing for as long as I did. But which busi­ness or or­gan­i­sa­tion would let a mother re­turn on one day a week, let alone half a day?</p>
    <p>Also, I would prob­a­bly look for a net­work of at least two other moth­ers who would take turns to look af­ter all our kids to al­low us all to con­tinue to work at least one day a week.</p>
    <p>Our chil­dren would take turns to go to a dif­fer­ent net­worked house­hold ev­ery day of the week to in­ter­act with other adults and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>There would be rou­tine and dis­ci­pline, as well as a lot of fun and cre­ativ­ity, but no for­eign maid.</p>
    <p>When dis­cussing gen­der equal­ity, do we have the gump­tion to ex­plore how equal­ity of op­por­tu­ni­ties could come in dif­fer­ent per­mu­ta­tions?</p>
    <p>In an­thro­pol­ogy, we see how ado­les­cent boys are phys­i­cally sep­a­rated from their moth­ers to be trained as “men”.</p>
    <p>My hus­band started work­ing less when our son reached ado­les­cence, ex­actly when our son, then al­ready taller than me, de­cided that it was not cool to be seen with his mum.</p>
    <p>His dad stepped in to shoul­der the par­ent­ing and dis­ci­pline.</p>
    <p>My hus­band is now re­tired and he sup­ports me when I work, just as I used to sup­port him.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially with us liv­ing longer, most of us can no longer think about one sin­gle ca­reer for life. It is wise for those who work to con­sider re­tir­ing early to pre­pare for a sec­ond ca­reer, and/or to sup­port a stay-home spouse back into work.</p>
    <p>As for the spouse (most usu­ally the wife) who stays at home, gen­der equal­ity could mean hav­ing a ca­reer at a later stage of his or her life. In other words, our ca­reers do not need to run syn­chronously.</p>
    <p>All we need now are en­light­ened hu­man re­source pro­fes­sion­als who do not write off stay-home moth­ers or older work­ers who can be just as ef­fec­tive and re­li­able as younger work­ers.</p>
    <p>Look­ing for a job in one’s 50s or 60s is not for the faint-hearted.</p>
    <p>And we also need HDB flats which can be fi­nanced by one wage.</p>
