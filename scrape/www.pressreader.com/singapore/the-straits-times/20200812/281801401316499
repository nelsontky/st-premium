    <p>NEW YORK • Nine years af­ter Steve Jobs stepped down and thrust Tim Cook to the top of Ap­ple, the com­pany is more valu­able than ever – and so is Mr Cook.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s share price rose al­most 5 per cent last week, leav­ing the com­pany the late Mr Jobs co-founded 44 years ago in his par­ents’ Cal­i­for­nia home on the cusp of a stock mar­ket mile­stone: a mar­ket value of nearly US$2 tril­lion (S$2.75 tril­lion). It was val­ued at about US$350 bil­lion when he died.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, Mr Cook has joined one of the most elite clubs for CEOs who did not ac­tu­ally found the com­pa­nies they run: his net worth has eclipsed US$1 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to cal­cu­la­tions by the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>His net worth es­ti­mate is based on an anal­y­sis of reg­u­la­tory fil­ings and ap­ply­ing the mar­ket per­for­mance of a typ­i­cal wealthy in­vestor to his pro­ceeds from share sales.</p>
    <p>Mr Cook, 59, said in 2015 that he planned to give most of his for­tune away. He has al­ready gifted mil­lions of dol­lars worth of Ap­ple shares, and his wealth could be lower if he has also made other undis­closed char­i­ta­ble gifts.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Ap­ple de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>“This tech cy­cle has been way big­ger and longer than I thought,” said Mr Hus­sein Kanji, a part­ner at ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Hox­ton Ven­tures, who had ex­pressed cau­tion about Ap­ple’s long-term out­look af­ter Mr Jobs left the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“Out of all these stocks, Ap­ple has be­come the great­est cash gen­er­a­tion ma­chine in his­tory.”</p>
    <p>The surge in Ap­ple’s stock comes as Mr Cook and his fel­low Big Tech CEOs – Jeff Be­zos of Ama­zon, Sundar Pichai of Al­pha­bet and Mark Zucker­berg of Face­book – face an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tions into what their crit­ics char­ac­terise as mo­nop­o­lis­tic pow­ers.</p>
    <p>While Mr Be­zos and Mr Zucker­berg have huge stakes in the com­pa­nies they founded, Mr Cook’s path to the 10-fig­ure-club was more in­cre­men­tal. The vast ma­jor­ity of his es­ti­mated wealth comes from eq­uity awards he has re­ceived since join­ing Ap­ple in 1998, where he has drawn plau­dits for mastering the com­pany’s com­plex sup­ply chain.</p>
