    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said yes­ter­day it is now time to pre­pare for a no-trade deal Brexit in 10 weeks as the Euro­pean Union had re­fused to ne­go­ti­ate se­ri­ously, adding that un­less Brus­sels changed course there would be no agree­ment.</p>
    <p>A tu­mul­tuous “no-deal” fi­nale to the United King­dom’s five-year Brexit cri­sis would sow chaos through the del­i­cate sup­ply chains that stretch across Bri­tain, the EU and be­yond – just as the eco­nomic hit from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic wors­ens.</p>
    <p>At what was sup­posed to be the “Brexit sum­mit” on Thurs­day, the EU de­liv­ered an ul­ti­ma­tum. It said it was con­cerned by a lack of progress, and called on Lon­don to yield on key stick­ing points or see a rup­ture of ties with the bloc from Jan 1.</p>
    <p>“I have con­cluded that we should get ready for Jan 1 with ar­range­ments that are more like Aus­tralia’s, based on sim­ple prin­ci­ples of global free trade,” Mr John­son said. “With high hearts and with com­plete con­fi­dence, we will pre­pare to em­brace the al­ter­na­tive and we will pros­per might­ily as an in­de­pen­dent free-trad­ing na­tion, con­trol­ling and set­ting our own laws.”</p>
    <p>A so-called “Aus­tralia deal” means that the United King­dom would trade on World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) terms: As a coun­try with­out an EU trade agree­ment, like Aus­tralia, tariffs would be im­posed un­der WTO rules, likely caus­ing sig­nif­i­cant price rises.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s re­marks, which fol­low an EU de­mand that Lon­don make fur­ther con­ces­sions, may push Brexit to­wards chaos, though he still left open the pos­si­bil­ity that the EU could change course and of­fer Bri­tain a bet­ter deal. “Un­less there is a fun­da­men­tal change of ap­proach, we’re go­ing to go for the Aus­tralia so­lu­tion. And we should do it with great con­fi­dence,” he said.</p>
    <p>Asked if he was walk­ing away from talks, Mr John­son said: “If there’s a fun­da­men­tal change of ap­proach, of course we are al­ways will­ing to lis­ten, but it didn’t seem par­tic­u­larly en­cour­ag­ing from the sum­mit in Brus­sels.”</p>
    <p>In Brus­sels, an EU of­fi­cial and a diplo­mat told Reuters the bloc was still pre­par­ing for more trade talks in Bri­tain next week. “He didn’t say they will leave the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble. So it’s all just rhetoric,” the diplo­mat said. The EU of­fi­cial said the bloc’s Brexit ne­go­ti­at­ing team was “al­ready pack­ing for an in­tense week in Lon­don”.</p>
    <p>Ster­ling dropped sharply af­ter Mr John­son’s re­marks that busi­nesses, hauliers and trav­ellers should get ready for a clean break from Europe.</p>
