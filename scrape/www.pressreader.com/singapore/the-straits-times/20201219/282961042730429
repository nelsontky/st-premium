    <p>En­ter­tain­ment and con­tent provider G.H.Y. Cul­ture & Me­dia Hold­ing be­gan trad­ing on the main­board of the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) yes­ter­day at 70 cents, some 6.1 per cent higher than its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) price of 66 cents per share.</p>
    <p>As at 10.02am, the stock eased to trade at 66.5 cents, trans­lat­ing to a gain of about 0.8 per cent from the IPO price. With nearly 8.7 mil­lion shares hav­ing changed hands at that time, G.H.Y. was one of the most ac­tive coun­ters by vol­ume on the Sin­ga­pore bourse in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>G.H.Y. group chief ex­ec­u­tive and chair­man Guo Jingyu yes­ter­day said the list­ing en­ables the firm – which pro­duces and pro­motes dra­mas, films and con­certs in the Asi­aPa­cific re­gion – to en­hance its pro­file both in Sin­ga­pore and abroad.</p>
    <p>G.H.Y. sold 21.7 mil­lion shares priced at 66 cents apiece as part of its list­ing on the SGX.</p>
    <p>The of­fer­ing com­prised 18.7 mil­lion place­ment shares and a pub­lic of­fer of three mil­lion shares.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic of­fer closed at noon on Wed­nes­day. The firm on Thurs­day evening re­ported that it re­ceived ap­pli­ca­tions from both re­tail and in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors for 16 times the num­ber of shares avail­able in the IPO’s pub­lic tranche.</p>
    <p>There were 1,402 valid ap­pli­ca­tions for a to­tal of 48.1 mil­lion shares un­der the pub­lic tranche.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, for the place­ment, G.H.Y. re­ceived in­di­ca­tions of in­ter­est for some 160.4 mil­lion shares with a to­tal value of $105.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>That means the place­ment was about 8.6 times sub­scribed.</p>
    <p>Con­cur­rent with but separate from the IPO, 10 cor­ner­stone in­vestors sub­scribed for and pur­chased an ag­gre­gate of 162.7 mil­lion cor­ner­stone shares, of which 141.2 mil­lion will be new shares is­sued by the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 21.5 mil­lion shares are sold by in­vest­ment hold­ing com­pany Taiho Hold­ing and group ad­viser John Ho Ah Huat.</p>
    <p>The cor­ner­stone in­vestors con­sist of Epi­cal En­ter­tain­ment, Hong Kong Chixin In­vest­ment, con­sul­tancy firm ICH Cap­i­tal, en­ter­tain­ment ser­vice provider iQiyi In­ter­na­tional Sin­ga­pore, King Kong Me­dia Pro­duc­tion, Osim In­ter­na­tional founder Ron Sim and his group’s brand cre­ator V3 Brands, Song­ful Global In­vest­ment, Qilin As­set Man­age­ment and in­vest­ment hold­ing com­pany Yin­son Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>G.H.Y. said the of­fer­ing, is­suance of new cor­ner­stone shares and sale of ven­dor cor­ner­stone shares would raise gross pro­ceeds of about $121.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>It in­tends to use most of the net pro­ceeds from both the IPO and the cor­ner­stone share is­suance to ex­pand its tele­vi­sion pro­gramme and film pro­duc­tion busi­ness, and the con­cert pro­duc­tion seg­ment.</p>
    <p>It will do so by in­vest­ing in pro­duc­tions, ac­qui­si­tions, joint ven­tures and/or strate­gic al­liances.</p>
    <p>The counter closed at 66.5 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
