    <p>Sev­eral malls in Or­chard Road and Gey­lang Serai mar­ket were among the new places added yes­ter­day to the Min­istry of Health’s (MOH) list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The malls in­cluded Ngee Ann City, Far East Shop­ping Cen­tre, Far East Plaza, Paragon and The Heeren.</p>
    <p>There were also 51 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,717.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded one com­mu­nity case, a 39-year-old Bangladesh­i man who is a work per­mit holder, said MOH.</p>
    <p>This case is cur­rently not linked to any previous cases and did not show any symp­toms.</p>
    <p>There were also three im­ported cases who had been placed on stayhome no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>One of them is a three-year-old Sin­ga­porean girl who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>She was con­firmed</p>
    <p>Covid-19 on Friday.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 47 cases were dor­mi­tory res­i­dents, of which 37 were to have al­ready quar­an­tined or iso­lated be­fore they were de­tected.</p>
    <p>Ten were de­tected through sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>MOH said all of the new cases an­nounced yes­ter­day were asymp­to­matic, and were de­tected through proac­tive screen­ing and sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, 98 per cent were im­ported or linked to known cases or clus­ters.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases a day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Over the same pe­riod, the num­ber of un­linked cases has also re­mained sta­ble, at an av­er­age of one a day.</p>
    <p>MOH also said an­other 110 cases were dis­charged yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of those who have fully re­cov­ered to 55,432.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 70 con­firmed cases re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 1,173 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties, with none in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
