    <p>When Mr Mohd Nasir Ja’apar, 47, was re­trenched from an oil and gas com­pany in April, the for­mer se­nior qual­ity en­gi­neer, who used to be head­hunted dur­ing pre-Covid times, felt con­fi­dent that he would be able to find an­other job.</p>
    <p>Within two weeks of be­ing laid off from his job of 5½ years, he was ap­proached by a head­hunter for a job op­por­tu­nity, but was re­jected after two in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>“I thought to my­self that it’s okay, an­other op­por­tu­nity will come. But it was not like that,” he told The Straits Times yes­ter­day. After four months and 60 ap­pli­ca­tions, he made no head­way in his job search.</p>
    <p>It was only after ca­reer coaches from Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) Ca­reers Con­nect helped him to im­prove his re­sume that he was of­fered a job as a se­nior qual­ity en­gi­neer at 3D Me­tal­forge, a small to medium-sized en­ter­prise spe­cial­is­ing in ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing and 3D printed ser­vices and prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“To be hon­est, it was my first time us­ing ca­reer coaches and j ob­match­ing ser­vices, be­cause in the past, I got jobs through ap­ply­ing di­rectly to a com­pany, or by be­ing head­hunted. So that’s why dur­ing the ini­tial pe­riod of my unemployme­nt, I was a lit­tle bit lost,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So when I went to WSG’s web­site and saw the op­por­tu­ni­ties and as­sis­tance, I just jumped into it with­out hav­ing much ex­pec­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>Now, he is un­der­go­ing a six­month pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing en­gi­neers, which started last month, to ease into his new role.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme com­prises both learn­ing in a class­room and on the job, and helps mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als like him bridge the gaps in his skills from his pre­vi­ous job. “The pro­gramme is built into your work it­self... it’s not go­ing to dis­rupt your job, and at the same time, you gain knowl­edge and can ap­ply it straight­away,” said Mr Nasir, who is sin­gle.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing to take a 20 per cent pay cut, he is grate­ful for the job and cred­its it to WSG’s as­sis­tance. “To those who are re­trenched... don’t give up hope. Some op­por­tu­ni­ties that knock on your door might be out­side your com­fort zone, but be open-minded, it would be a waste to let them go,” he said.</p>
