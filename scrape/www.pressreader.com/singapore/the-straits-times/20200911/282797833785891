    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>This is not a good time to hide your feel­ings – ei­ther pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive. They are sure to pop out on their own.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>If you are sin­gle, this could be a great day to ask some­one new out. If not, just en­joy the com­pany of your sweetie.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Now is a good time to get or­gan­ised and stay that way. Make lists of what you need to do and en­sure you fol­low through on them.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You have to seize the ini­tia­tive and push your­self in a new di­rec­tion. Things start to look good once you have made progress.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your feel­ings are deeper than usual, thanks to a pow­er­ful in­tu­ition that things are about to change for the bet­ter. Trust your in­stincts.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You feel com­pelled to spend time with peo­ple – so get out there and min­gle. Some­one you meet will be vi­tal to your fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your per­sonal en­ergy is a lit­tle off, but that just means you need to slow down and let things go if you can­not con­trol them.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Try some­thing a lit­tle un­usual. You are filled with great en­ergy and may be able to learn new tricks if you can fol­low it wherever it leads.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Give your peo­ple a lit­tle ex­tra love. You may not un­der­stand what is go­ing on with them un­til you speak up. At least one needs your help.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Your heart might not be in your work and while that may not be a lot of fun, you may be in­spired to try some­thing new.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are in a state of in­er­tia, but once you get things rolling, you should be able to keep up your mo­men­tum un­til your en­ergy kicks back in.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your dreams are more pow­er­ful than those of most other peo­ple. Scrib­ble down what you can in the morn­ing to re­mem­ber it all.</p>
