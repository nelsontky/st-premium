    <p>This week, more than a month af­ter Amer­i­cans went to the polls, the Democratic Party’s Mr Joe Bi­den was fi­nally af­firmed as win­ner of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion by the Elec­toral Col­lege. As the United States turns the page on the Don­ald Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and the tran­si­tion to a Bi­den one moves full steam ahead, South-east Asian coun­tries will look for­ward to a new chap­ter in their ties. Af­ter four years of the un­cer­tainty and un­pre­dictabil­ity of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, the ex­pec­ta­tions are that of greater sta­bil­ity and pre­dictabil­ity in the new ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ap­proach to­wards the re­gion. Im­por­tantly, they would ap­pre­ci­ate it if more at­ten­tion is paid af­ter four years of rel­a­tive ne­glect by Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially as the re­gion has faced a China that has be­come more pow­er­ful and as­sertive. While the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion pushed back against China’s as­sertive­ness in the South China Sea, the ab­sence of the Pres­i­dent and of se­nior US of­fi­cials from key sum­mits led to a sense that Wash­ing­ton lacked com­mit­ment to the re­gion. Mr Bi­den can, how­ever, re­as­sure coun­tries about the im­por­tance he at­taches to ties with them and the re­gion by show­ing up him­self and by send­ing se­nior of­fi­cials to key fo­rums such as the East Asia Sum­mit. At a time when re­gional economies are be­com­ing more en­meshed with China’s – in­clud­ing through Bei­jing’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI) to build in­fra­struc­ture over­seas, and the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship free trade deal – they will wel­come more US eco­nomic en­gage­ment to bal­ance this.</p>
    <p>It will be dif­fi­cult for the US to join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship in the near term. But there are other ways in which the US can in­crease eco­nomic ties with the re­gion, in­clud­ing by boost­ing the In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion – its an­swer to China’s BRI. It would be a relief to the re­gion, too, if the US un­der Mr Bi­den low­ers the tem­per­a­ture in its ri­valry with China. While it is ex­pected that the strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the two pow­ers will con­tinue, given the bi­par­ti­san sup­port for it in the US, the hope is that the new ad­min­is­tra­tion will be less stri­dent and con­fronta­tional in its rhetoric and ac­tions.</p>
    <p>The worry is that as ten­sions es­ca­late be­tween the two, coun­tries in the re­gion will be forced to take sides. That is some­thing no one wants to do. China is the largest trad­ing part­ner for many of them, and the US is im­por­tant as a bal­ance against China’s grow­ing in­flu­ence. In the four years since the pres­i­dency of Mr Barack Obama dur­ing which Mr Bi­den was vice-pres­i­dent, the re­gion has changed. And so has the US. It is vi­tal that both sides reac­quaint and un­der­stand each other again if they are to co­op­er­ate well. The gains for both – and for the re­gion, too – are too im­por­tant to be left to chance.</p>
