    <p>OR­LANDO Los An­ge­les Lak­ers star LeBron James is not think­ing about his sports legacy as he closes in on a fourth Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals win.</p>
    <p>The for­ward is within touch­ing dis­tance of yet an­other cham­pi­onship as the Lak­ers head into Game 5 in Or­lando with a 3-1 lead in their best-of-seven se­ries against the Mi­ami Heat.</p>
    <p>But, while a fourth cham­pi­onship ring is cer­tain to stir de­bate about James’ pre­cise rank­ing in the pan­theon of NBA greats, the 35-yearold has given it lit­tle thought.</p>
    <p>“I don’t re­ally think about it too much,” he told re­porters. “The story will be told how it’s sup­posed to be told and be writ­ten how it’s sup­posed to be writ­ten. But I don’t live my life think­ing about legacy.”</p>
    <p>He added that he was more pre­oc­cu­pied with his legacy as a role model and so­cial justice cam­paigner.</p>
    <p>“What I do off the floor is what means more to me than what I do on the floor,” said James, who this week re­ceived a time-hon­oured ac­co­lade re­served for elite US ath­letes by ap­pear­ing on the box of the</p>
    <p>Wheaties break­fast ce­real.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents from his “I Prom­ise” school, which he started in his home town of Akron, Ohio, also ap­peared on the box.</p>
    <p>“See­ing my kids on the back of a Wheaties box yes­ter­day was one of the best mo­ments of my life,” he said. “The game of bas­ket­ball will pass me by. But... how I in­spire the next gen­er­a­tion is what mat­ters to me the most.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers, who re­turned to the Fi­nals af­ter miss­ing the post-sea­son for six straight years, can clinch their 17th ti­tle – and the first in 10 years – in Game 5.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing things more dif­fi­cult for Mi­ami is that guard Go­ran Dragic, who has not played since the first half of Game 1, is doubt­ful and for­ward Bam Ade­bayo is lim­ited be­cause of a neck in­jury.</p>
    <p>Separately, Chi­nese state tele­vi­sion CCTV said yes­ter­day that it will re­sume air­ing NBA games on its sports chan­nel this morn­ing, al­most a year af­ter it halted broad­casts of the com­pe­ti­tion fol­low­ing a diplo­matic spat.</p>
    <p>The broad­caster stopped show­ing NBA games last Oc­to­ber af­ter a Hous­ton Rock­ets ex­ec­u­tive tweeted sup­port for Hong Kong pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers last year.</p>
