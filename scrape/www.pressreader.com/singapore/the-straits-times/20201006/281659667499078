    <p>Sin­ga­pore aims to grow not just a vi­brant, in­no­va­tive econ­omy, but also an in­clu­sive one in which growth up­lifts all Sin­ga­pore­ans, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It will be achieved in two ways, he added, in a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>One, by pro­vid­ing holis­tic sup­port to up­lift vul­ner­a­ble work­ers, and two, en­sur­ing work­ers have skills to stay rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>Lower-in­come work­ers have been hit par­tic­u­larly hard by Covid-19, he noted. They face a “twin chal­lenge”, as they are also in sec­tors that will be af­fected by longer-term struc­tural changes in the econ­omy, such as re­tail or the food and bev­er­age sec­tor, he added.</p>
    <p>With mid­dle-in­come and mid­dleage work­ers, they not only have heavy fam­ily re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, but also face the chal­lenges of a rapidly evolv­ing labour mar­ket, said Mr</p>
    <p>Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance.</p>
    <p>There is even greater ur­gency for them to gain new skills and tran­si­tion into jobs with good, long-term prospects.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that im­prov­ing the job mar­ket for the more vul­ner­a­ble work­ers is a re­lent­less ef­fort, re­quir­ing a shift in cul­ture and em­ployer mind­sets be­yond in­cen­tives.</p>
    <p>But cre­ative so­lu­tions for dif­fer­ent groups of work­ers can be cus­tomised if Sin­ga­pore adopts flex­i­bil­ity in job de­sign, he said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, some work­ers find it hard to travel far for work, he noted. At the same time, some shops in the heart­land strug­gle to find work­ers.</p>
    <p>By putting such job open­ings on plat­forms such as so­cial ser­vices of­fices and com­mu­nity cen­tres, the match­ing of work­ers with busi­nesses can be fa­cil­i­tated, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try as well as Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Low Yen Ling will look into how Sin­ga­pore can bet­ter help dis­placed ma­ture pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Ms Low, who is also the chair­man of the com­mit­tee of may­ors, will also ex­plore how Sin­ga­pore can make bet­ter use of mi­cro-jobs to bring job op­por­tu­ni­ties closer to the heart­land. More de­tails will be an­nounced later, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>The Deputy Prime Min­is­ter fur­ther said the Gov­ern­ment has been de­lib­er­ate in chan­nelling ex­tra sup­port to vul­ner­a­ble groups.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, ma­ture and older work­ers are el­i­gi­ble for higher wage sup­port and course fee sub­si­dies in ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM), a lad­der that sets out min­i­mum pay and train­ing re­quire­ments for work­ers at dif­fer­ent skill lev­els, is also an im­por­tant labour pol­icy in­no­va­tion, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>The PWM is more than a sec­tor­based min­i­mum wage, he added.</p>
    <p>It is a four-in-one frame­work: a proper ca­reer lad­der, skills up­grad­ing lad­der, pro­duc­tiv­ity im­prove­ment lad­der and wage en­hance</p>
    <p>ment lad­der.</p>
    <p>“These four up­grad­ing lad­ders are mu­tu­ally re­in­forc­ing,” he said, re­it­er­at­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit</p>
    <p>ment to ex­pand PWM to more sec­tors while en­sur­ing busi­nesses in the sec­tors can ab­sorb the change.</p>
    <p>While the move will raise business</p>
    <p>costs and add to the dif­fi­cul­ties faced by firms, Covid-19 has high­lighted why it is crit­i­cal for com­pa­nies to be more man­power-lean, pro</p>
    <p>duc­tive and have jobs that are at­trac­tive to lo­cals to en­sure their longterm sur­vival, he added.</p>
    <p>In the face of stiffer global com­pe­ti­tion and deep tech­no­log­i­cal changes, as well as skills be­com­ing ob­so­lete faster, Sin­ga­pore needs to con­tin­u­ally reskill its work­force, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is in­vest­ing sig­nif­i­cantly for this to be done for ev­ery worker at ev­ery age, he added.</p>
    <p>But even as Sin­ga­pore lev­els up the skills of ev­ery worker, it will also need to bring in global tal­ent to com­ple­ment the home-grown tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“By build­ing on com­ple­men­tary strengths, we can build cut­ting-edge ca­pa­bil­i­ties in our work­force and our firms, and plug into global net­works. This will ul­ti­mately ben­e­fit all Sin­ga­porean work­ers.”</p>
    <p>To achieve this syn­ergy, he pledged that the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to up­date for­eign work­force poli­cies care­fully, such as Em­ploy­ment Pass and S Pass rules.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Heng urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to join in the ef­fort.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans, grow­ing up in a mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety, have an edge in build­ing re­la­tion­ships with peo­ple around the world, es­pe­cially in a more frag­mented post-Covid land­scape. So let us build on this strength.”</p>
