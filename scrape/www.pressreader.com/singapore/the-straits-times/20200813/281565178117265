    <p>Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek and a unit of Ger­man phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and life sci­ences gi­ant Bayer have formed a new US$30 mil­lion (S$41.2 mil­lion) com­pany to de­velop break­throughs in ver­ti­cal farm­ing, a move that will help to fur­ther re­in­force Sin­ga­pore’s food sup­ply.</p>
    <p>A new US$30 mil­lion (S$41.2 mil­lion) com­pany has been formed to de­velop break­throughs in ver­ti­cal farm­ing, a move that will help to fur­ther re­in­force Sin­ga­pore’s food sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Called Un­fold, it is a tie-up be­tween Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek and a unit of Ger­man phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and life sci­ences gi­ant Bayer. The Straits Times un­der­stands that they will have equal share in the com­pany, which is in­cor­po­rated in the United States.</p>
    <p>Its pri­mary fo­cus is on im­prov­ing the qual­ity and va­ri­ety of food, as well as boost­ing the ef­fi­ciency of its pro­duc­tion, in­clud­ing that of pop­u­lar veg­eta­bles such as let­tuce and spinach. In do­ing so, it will en­sure the safe and re­li­able sup­ply of food, some­thing that is vi­tal for coun­tries with lit­tle arable land and in times of cri­sis like the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Bayer yes­ter­day when an­nounc­ing the union be­tween its in­vest­ment unit Leaps by Bayer and Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s head of agribusi­ness John Vaske noted that food se­cu­rity is a pri­or­ity for Sin­ga­pore, point­ing to the coun­try’s “30 by 30” goal, which is to pro­duce 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030.</p>
    <p>He also told The Straits Times that Sin­ga­pore has been for­ma­tive in de­vel­op­ing ver­ti­cal farm­ing.</p>
    <p>“So we have in­sights and knowl­edge of the in­dus­try that Un­fold can ben­e­fit from through the setup of its com­mer­cial, re­search and de­vel­op­ment op­er­a­tions here.”</p>
    <p>These op­er­a­tions will also be establishe­d in Cal­i­for­nia, where Un­fold will be head­quar­tered in the city of Davis.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on the ge­netic po­ten­tial of ver­ti­cal farm­ing also sets the com­pany apart from most ver­ti­cal farm­ing start-ups, which in­vari­ably con­cen­trate on de­vel­op­ing more ef­fi­cient in­fra­struc­tures, Bayer said.</p>
    <p>Un­fold has al­ready en­tered into an agree­ment for spec­i­fied rights to germplasm, or seed ge­net­ics, from Bayer’s vegetable port­fo­lio, a move that will en­able it to de­velop new va­ri­eties of seeds.</p>
    <p>It also plans to come up with agro­nomic ad­vice that is tailored for grow­ing crops in the unique in­door en­vi­ron­ment of ver­ti­cal farms.</p>
    <p>These farms, also known as in­door farms, lever­age ar­ti­fi­cial light to grow crops, are less de­pen­dent on man-made chem­i­cals and op­ti­mise the use of wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s chief ex­ec­u­tive is Dr John Pur­cell, who was pre­vi­ously Bayer Crop Science’s head of vegetable seeds re­search and de­vel­op­ment, said Bayer in its state­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Pur­cell said Un­fold’s in­vest­ment in germplasm and crop growth mod­els is timely as the two fields are “largely un­der­served”.</p>
    <p>“Some tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies do not have ac­cess to germplasm re­sources. The power of Un­fold is that we will com­bine the ex­per­tise and 100 per cent fo­cus on the ge­net­ics for ver­ti­cal farm­ing, with ac­cess to the best-in-class germplasm of the Bayer vegetable seed busi­ness,” he added.</p>
