    <p>BER­LIN • Ger­many an­nounced manda­tory tests for trav­ellers re­turn­ing from high-risk re­gions af­ter new coro­n­avirus cases breached the 1,000-a-day thresh­old for the first time since May yes­ter­day, fu­elling fears of a re­turn to an eco­nom­i­cally dis­rup­tive lock­down.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Jens Spahn said yes­ter­day that free com­pul­sory test­ing would be in force from to­mor­row af­ter the Robert Koch In­sti­tute, Ger­many’s pub­lic health agency, re­ported 1,045 new cases in a sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>Part of the in­crease was due to more tests tak­ing place, he said, but the im­pact of hol­i­day­mak­ers re­turn­ing to Ger­many and of flag­ging so­cial dis­tanc­ing dis­ci­pline was also sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>Ger­many clas­si­fies al­most all the world out­side the Euro­pean Union as high risk, as well as some re­gions within the bloc, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Aragon, Cat­alo­nia and Navarre in Spain, and Bel­gium’s An­twerp prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The com­pul­sory tests mean trav­ellers will not have to quar­an­tine for two weeks. Any­one who re­fuses to take the test could face a fine of up to €25,000 (S$40,587). “If any­body thinks they can be stub­born at the air­port and deal with the fine when it comes later, no. They’re go­ing into quar­an­tine for two weeks,” Mr Spahn added.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s ap­proach is sim­i­lar to that i n neigh­bour­ing France, which re­quires trav­ellers from some coun­tries to take Covid-19 tests at air­ports and ports. Some other Euro­pean coun­tries re­quire trav­ellers to take a test in the days be­fore their trip.</p>
    <p>With Europe’s largest econ­omy only start­ing to re­cover from the near-to­tal l ock­down that was im­posed in March, any sign of re­newed re­stric­tions will dis­may in­vestors. Mr Spahn said he thought a re­newed clo­sure of shops could prob­a­bly still be avoided.</p>
    <p>The head of the Ger­man doc­tors’ union said ear­lier this week that Ger­many was al­ready con­tend­ing with a sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus and risked squan­der­ing its early suc­cess by flout­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials be­lieve it will be harder to con­trol the spread of new in­fec­tions from au­tumn, mak­ing it all the more im­por­tant to keep num­bers down as the sum­mer draws to a close.</p>
    <p>The lock­down pushed the num­ber of daily new cases down to as low as 159 in mid-July, but num­bers have been ris­ing since, fu­elled by lo­cal out­breaks, in­clud­ing one cen­tred on a slaugh­ter­house that had the en­tire city of Gueter­sloh placed un­der re­stric­tions.</p>
