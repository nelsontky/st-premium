    <p>LON­DON • Nigel Pear­son has ex­pressed his re­gret at not be­ing able to fin­ish the job he started at Wat­ford af­ter he was sacked by the rel­e­ga­tion-threat­ened Premier League club.</p>
    <p>The Hor­nets an­nounced on Sun­day that the for­mer Le­ices­ter boss had left the club with im­me­di­ate ef­fect with two games of the sea­son re­main­ing and their top-flight sta­tus not yet se­cured.</p>
    <p>In a post on his of­fi­cial Twit­ter ac­count yes­ter­day, the 56-year-old said: “I’ve been over­whelmed by the good wishes I’ve re­ceived from Wat­ford sup­port­ers and the foot­ball com­mu­nity. Thank you all for your kind mes­sages.</p>
    <p>“Al­though not able to fin­ish the task I was brought in to achieve, I wish Wat­ford all the best for their fi­nal two games. Cheers, Nige.”</p>
    <p>He was ap­pointed head coach in De­cem­ber last year – the club’s third per­ma­nent boss of the sea­son fol­low­ing the fir­ings of Javi Gra­cia and Quique Sanchez Flores – with the team sit­ting bot­tom of the table and seven points from safety.</p>
    <p>The Hor­nets are the first Premier League side to have dis­pensed with three man­agers in a sin­gle sea­son.</p>
    <p>Pear­son per­formed a near-mir­a­cle with a lim­ited squad since his first match in charge on Dec 14. He recorded 25 points from 20 games played, more than eight other teams, in­clud­ing top-four con­tenders Le­ices­ter. He also has the best win rate (35 per cent) of any Wat­ford man­ager in top-flight his­tory.</p>
    <p>But the axe still fell on him fol­low­ing a “frank ex­change of views” with club owner Gino Pozzo.</p>
    <p>Given that his dis­missal has come this late in the sea­son, crit­ics have ques­tioned whether the board have shot them­selves in the foot.</p>
    <p>Pun­dit Jamie Red­knapp told Sky</p>
    <p>Sports: “It’s a lack of faith in man­agers full stop. It’s their fourth man­ager this sea­son (in­clud­ing care­taker Hay­den Mullins), and that sug­gests they’ve never been happy.</p>
    <p>“They are a club that de­cide to sack man­agers. I’d like to say I’m sur­prised but I’m not, that’s how they do it. With two games to go, it’s an in­cred­i­ble de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>The duo of for­mer West Ham mid­fielder Mullins and for­mer Arse­nal goal­keeper Gra­ham Stack will take charge of Wat­ford’s fi­nal games, with Sky Sports re­port­ing that the club will take stock of the va­cant man­age­rial po­si­tion af­ter their im­me­di­ate fu­ture is set­tled.</p>
    <p>They are in 17th place, three points clear of the bot­tom three, and have a plus-four goal dif­fer­ence to Bournemout­h and As­ton Villa.</p>
    <p>But with sec­ond-placed Manchester City vis­it­ing to­day and Arse­nal, who can still snag a Europa League spot, to play on Sun­day, Wat­ford face an anx­ious fi­nal week that will de­ter­mine if their five-year stay in the top flight con­tin­ues.</p>
