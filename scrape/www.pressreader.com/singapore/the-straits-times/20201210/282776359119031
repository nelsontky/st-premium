    <p>NEW YORK • Bad Bunny (left), the Puerto Ri­can singer, rap­per and stream­ing megas­tar, has set an in­dus­try mile­stone with his lat­est al­bum, El Ul­timo Tour Del Mundo. It is the first LP en­tirely in Span­ish to top the Bill­board 200 al­bum chart.</p>
    <p>El Ul­timo Tour Del Mundo (The Last Tour Of The World) had the equiv­a­lent of 116,000 sales in the United States, ac­cord­ing to Nielsen Mu­sic, in­clud­ing 146 mil­lion streams and 12,000 copies sold as a com­plete pack­age.</p>
    <p>It is Bad Bunny’s first No. 1 – his last al­bum, YHLQMDLG, stalled at No. 2 in March.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bill­board, two al­bums “mostly” in Span­ish have taken the top spot be­fore: pop clas­si­cal vo­cal quar­tet Il Divo’s An­cora (2006) and Amer­i­can singer Selena’s Dream­ing Of You (1995), but Bad Bunny is the first to reach No. 1 with lyrics en­tirely in Span­ish.</p>
    <p>Stream­ing has been key to Bad Bunny’s suc­cess. He is pop­u­lar around the world and, last week, Spo­tify an­nounced that he was the ser­vice’s most-streamed act so far this year, with 8.3 bil­lion clicks of his songs.</p>
    <p>Last week, an­other lan­guage bar­rier on the charts was bro­ken when K-pop stars BTS had the first</p>
    <p>Korean-lan­guage No. 1 sin­gle with Life Goes On.</p>
    <p>Also on this week’s al­bum chart, Amer­i­can singer Mi­ley Cyrus opened at No. 2 with her rock rein­ven­tion Plas­tic Hearts, her high­est chart po­si­tion since 2013, when her fourth stu­dio al­bum Bangerz went to No. 1.</p>
    <p>BTS’ al­bum Be, last week’s top seller, fell to No. 3 in its sec­ond week out.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can singer Ari­ana Grande’s Po­si­tions is No. 4 and late rap­per Pop Smoke’s Shoot For The Stars, Aim For The Moon is in fifth place.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian singer Michael Bu­ble’s Christ­mas, a sea­sonal hit each year since it was re­leased in 2011, climbed seven spots to No. 6.</p>
