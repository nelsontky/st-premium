    <p>SingPost will be launch­ing two new stamp sets fea­tur­ing lo­cal mas­cots and ev­ery­day lingo in the first week of Au­gust. This marks the re­sump­tion of new stamp is­sues which were sus­pended dur­ing the twom­onth cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June.</p>
    <p>The mas­cot-themed set, which will be avail­able from Aug 3, is in sup­port of the SG Cares Move­ment which aims to foster a car­ing and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures five fa­mil­iar icons in­clud­ing Nila the lion, the of­fi­cial mas­cot of the 2015 South-east Asian Games; Wa­ter Wally, who spreads the mes­sage of wa­ter con­ser­va­tion; and Shar­ity the ele­phant, who sym­bol­ises care and com­pas­sion for the less for­tu­nate.</p>
    <p>The other two are Captain Green, the frog who pro­motes a clean and green life­style, and Singa the lion, who ex­horts Sin­ga­pore­ans to be cour­te­ous and con­sid­er­ate.</p>
    <p>This set of mint stamps comes in two de­nom­i­na­tions: 30 cents and 70 cents. Pre-can­celled first-day cov­ers are at $3.75 each and pre­sen­ta­tion packs at $4.80 each.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond set of five stamps, which will be avail­able from Aug 7, cel­e­brates Sin­ga­pore’s 55th year of in­de­pen­dence and fea­tures sketches of the city state’s iconic quirks. These in­clude com­mon phrases such as “chope”, “BTO” and quin­tes­sen­tial Sin­ga­porean be­hav­iour like join­ing long queues.</p>
    <p>This set also in­cludes a minia­ture sheet which shows the life­style changes that res­i­dents in Sin­ga­pore had to adopt dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, such as video con­fer­enc­ing ses­sions and home work­outs. The set comes in two de­nom­i­na­tions: 30 cents and $1.40. Pre­can­celled first-day cov­ers cost $3.40 or $6.05, pre­sen­ta­tion packs $9.25 and minia­ture sheets $2.</p>
    <p>Both sets can be pur­chased at all post of­fices, philatelic stores and on­line at shop.singpost.com</p>
    <p>How­ever, cus­tomers will not be able to use the com­mem­o­ra­tive date-stamp dur­ing the launch of the sets in a bid to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers who wish to have their stamps can­celled may de­posit them at any philatelic store and they will be con­tacted when their items are ready for col­lec­tion.</p>
