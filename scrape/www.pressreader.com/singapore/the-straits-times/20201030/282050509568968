    <p>For decades, China har­nessed its man­u­fac­tur­ing prow­ess to lift the coun­try from poverty, flood­ing the world with a dizzy­ing ar­ray of cheap goods that not only im­proved lives from Su­dan to South Carolina, but also fed a run­away trend of con­sumerism.</p>
    <p>When it fi­nally had enough of be­ing the world’s fac­tory and wanted to pur­sue loftier as­pi­ra­tions, the world, par­tic­u­larly the United States, got wor­ried.</p>
    <p>It did not help that in pur­suit of its am­bi­tions, China faced ac­cu­sa­tions of dirty prac­tices such as forced tech­nol­ogy trans­fers, and theft of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty (IP) and trade se­crets.</p>
    <p>To­day, the world’s two big­gest pow­ers are fight­ing for dom­i­na­tion in tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>And this bat­tle be­tween gi­ants is go­ing to be fought for a long time to come, as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping urged laser-fo­cus on de­vel­op­ing indige­nous in­no­va­tion that will make his coun­try no longer be­holden to oth­ers for crit­i­cal core tech­nol­ogy still needed to power Chi­nese smart­phones and com­put­ers or fly Chi­nese planes.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, China has raced ahead in the fields of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and 5G devel­op­ment and made great leaps in au­ton­o­mous driv­ing, ad­vanced ro­bot­ics and med­i­cal de­vices.</p>
    <p>Its drones are top sell­ers, its elec­tric ve­hi­cles dom­i­nate var­i­ous cities’ pub­lic trans­port net­works and it has rev­o­lu­tionised e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>As the coun­try’s top lead­ers wrapped up a cru­cial four-day sum­mit this week to chart the na­tion’s path over the next five to 15 years, its goals were crys­tal clear: achieve tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance and lead the world in in­no­va­tion by 2035.</p>
    <p>In a com­mu­nique is­sued at the end of the meet­ing, the lead­ers in­sisted that “tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance must be the strate­gic pil­lar of the coun­try’s devel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>China has been steadily mov­ing up this tra­jec­tory to­wards tech supremacy, but it is now break­ing into a sprint as the US de­lib­er­ately starves it of semi­con­duc­tor chips and such.</p>
    <p>What this means is a shot in the arm for sci­en­tific re­search and devel­op­ment, which will surely take a larger slice of the GDP-spend­ing pie and move China closer to be­com­ing the world’s big­gest in­vestor in R&D.</p>
    <p>It is No. 2 glob­ally now in ab­so­lute ex­pen­di­ture, chalk­ing up US$468 bil­lion (S$640 bil­lion) in in­vest­ment, while the US spent US$582 bil­lion in 2018, based on the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment’s pur­chas­ing power par­ity com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>Last year, China spent 2.23 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct on R&D, while the US sank in about 2.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>De­spite the coro­n­avirus out­break, China could still be on tar­get to hit 2.5 per cent growth this year, a fig­ure set out in its 2015-2020 Five-Year Plan.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Chi­nese lead­ers dis­cussed the next Five-Year Plan dur­ing their meet­ing over the past few days, tar­gets may be re­vealed only at next year’s an­nual par­lia­men­tary ses­sion.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts are al­ready pro­ject­ing at least a 3 per cent tar­get.</p>
    <p>An HSBC re­port re­leased on Tues­day said R&D in China will get a big boost, es­pe­cially now that Pres­i­dent Xi has or­dered the en­tire coun­try to get be­hind the new buzzword: dual cir­cu­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This eco­nomic strat­egy of shift­ing re­liance to the do­mes­tic mar­ket while also con­tin­u­ing to en­gage the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket was spelt out in yes­ter­day’s com­mu­nique as a key plank in the next Five-Year Plan.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing’s dual-cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy points to an R&D in­vest­ment boom in the years ahead; pub­lic fund­ing for R&D and ICT (in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy) in­fras­truc­ture is set to surge,” said the re­port.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is ex­pected to use tax in­cen­tives, pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ships and in­dus­trial poli­cies to pro­mote cor­po­rate R&D in­vest­ment, it said.</p>
    <p>In­no­va­tive com­pa­nies can also get a leg up with fund­ing if China makes sound cap­i­tal mar­ket re­forms, while strength­en­ing IP rights will also spur more R&D en­deav­ours from both do­mes­tic and for­eign com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Those with a keen in­ter­est in China’s tech am­bi­tions should keep their eyes peeled for its next medium and long-term plan for science and tech­nol­ogy that will be a road map for its tech devel­op­ment from next year to 2035.</p>
    <p>With­out a doubt, those who will soon pop­u­late – or re­claim – the White House will be watch­ing with great in­ter­est, and com­ing up with their own coun­ter­plan.</p>
