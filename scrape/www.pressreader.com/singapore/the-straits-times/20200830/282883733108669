    <p>Ms Lena Birse is a stay-at-home mum who loves buy­ing tech stocks dur­ing mar­ket crashes.</p>
    <p>Mr Jay Smith is a former pro­fes­sional gamer who switched from crypto-cur­ren­cies to blue chips.</p>
    <p>Ms Heloise Gre­eff is a data sci­en­tist who uses ma­chine learn­ing to an­a­lyse trad­ing pat­terns.</p>
    <p>And Mr Mik Mullins is a re­tired ho­tel ex­ec­u­tive who is bet­ting the mar­ket is about to plunge.</p>
    <p>These four am­a­teur traders use dif­fer­ent ap­proaches but have one thing in com­mon: They are killing it in one of the wildest mar­kets in mem­ory, with re­turns rang­ing from 20 per cent to 60 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Play­ing the mar­ket is fraught with risks, of course, and sto­ries abound of new­com­ers mak­ing rookie mis­takes.</p>
    <p>To learn how to avoid pit­falls,</p>
    <p>Bloomberg News picked the brains of these four top per­form­ers on eToro, a dig­i­tal trad­ing plat­form with 14 mil­lion users that is reg­u­lated by Bri­tain’s Fi­nan­cial Con­duct Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>EToro lets peo­ple copy the trades of in­vestors with proven track records, like this quar­tet.</p>
    <p>They all be­lieve new­com­ers make mis­takes by not in­vest­ing for the long term and for fail­ing to di­ver­sify their port­fo­lios with at least 30 well-re­searched names.</p>
    <p>Here are the other things they see peo­ple do­ing wrong, based on their ex­pe­ri­ence:</p>
    <p>JUMP­ING IN WITH­OUT TEST­ING OUT TRAD­ING STRATE­GIES</p>
    <p>Ms Gre­eff, 30, a re­search fel­low in ma­chine learn­ing at Ox­ford Univer­sity, used a “demo ac­count” on eToro to ex­e­cute sim­u­lated trades with US$100,000 (S$136,000) of fake money.</p>
    <p>She dis­cov­ered straight away that try­ing to time the mar­ket and trade in and out of po­si­tions ev­ery day was a bad idea.</p>
    <p>When the S&P 500 Index and other bench­marks were hit­ting all­time highs late last year, the data was send­ing her a pow­er­ful sig­nal: It was time to re­treat.</p>
    <p>“I am a con­ser­va­tive trader so I liq­ui­dated 60 per cent of the po­si­tions in my port­fo­lio, and while I missed the highs of Jan­uary, I had peace of mind,” she says.</p>
    <p>Since then, she has waded back in, and two of the big­gest hold­ings in her 60-stock port­fo­lio are Master­card and IBM.</p>
    <p>She is up around 20 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>CHAS­ING HYPED STOCKS IN­STEAD OF DO­ING RE­SEARCH</p>
    <p>When the dig­i­tal coin bub­ble popped in 2018, Mr Smith’s port­fo­lio fell al­most 54 per cent and he learnt a painful les­son on hype.</p>
    <p>These days, the 32-year-old’s bets are a far less racy mix: Chip­maker AMD and Mi­crosoft are long-time favourites, and this year he started buy­ing shares in Home De­pot and Lowe’s, the home im­prove­ment gi­ants.</p>
    <p>He feels com­fort­able with such tac­tics be­cause he does his home­work. “I spend a large amount of time read­ing prod­uct user man­u­als and watch­ing launch events on YouTube.</p>
    <p>“A so­lar com­pany I fol­low re­cently held a train­ing day on­line, so I watched to see how they in­stall their equip­ment.” He is up about 50 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>IN­VEST­ING MONEY</p>
    <p>YOU NEED IN FIVE YEARS</p>
    <p>Mr Mullins ad­vised friends to fol­low one pri­mary rule: Never in­vest money that you are go­ing to need for big-ticket items such as a house or col­lege tu­ition. He is a true be­liever in in­vest­ing for the long term. He does not even like to look at his port­fo­lio more than once a week.</p>
    <p>He is up al­most 29 per cent for the year, thanks to his long po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>GET­TING YOUR­SELF INTO COM­PLEX TRADES BE­FORE YOU’RE READY</p>
    <p>It has never been eas­ier for retail in­vestors to use lever­age, op­tions and short-sell­ing, but am­a­teurs should avoid com­pli­cated tac­tics un­til they un­der­stand how they can back­fire, say both Mr Mullins and Mr Smith.</p>
    <p>The rush of new­bie traders into flashy equity-trad­ing apps have al­ready led to some grim con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>In June, Robin­hood pledged to change el­e­ments of its op­tions trad­ing plat­form af­ter the sui­cide of a 20-year-old user who had an ac­count that showed a neg­a­tive bal­ance of more than US$700,000.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s co-founders said they would con­sider ad­di­tional el­i­gi­bil­ity re­quire­ments for users who wanted to tap more ad­vanced op­tions strate­gies.</p>
    <p>OB­SES­SIVELY CHECK­ING YOUR PORT­FO­LIO</p>
    <p>It can be tempt­ing to keep look­ing at the daily swings in your stocks’ prices, but if you do this ev­ery day, it spurs pan­icky trades and losses.</p>
    <p>Over time, Ms Birse said, she built a tol­er­ance for risk. Af­ter the pan­demic hit, she re­sisted the urge to panic. In­stead, she bided her time and pre­pared to add to her po­si­tions in long-time “win­ners” such as Shopify, the Cana­dian e-com­merce firm that has sky­rock­eted 148 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>“I used to turn off the com­puter dur­ing sell-offs. But then I wanted to be more ac­tive, more ag­gres­sive, so in March, I steeled my nerves, waited three weeks, and then it was time to go shop­ping. It felt like the sale of the cen­tury.” Her port­fo­lio is up 61 per cent.</p>
