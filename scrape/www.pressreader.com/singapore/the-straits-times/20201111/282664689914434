    <p>Adapted from au­thor Al­dous Hux­ley’s dystopian clas­sic, the new sci­ence-fic­tion se­ries Brave New World takes place i n the seem­ingly utopian city of New Lon­don, whose cit­i­zens think they are per­fectly happy – un­til an out­sider ar­rives and re­veals the cracks in their so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In an on­line ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sion about the show, the cast and creator say Hux­ley’s prophetic vi­sion eas­ily de­scribes much of the world to­day, es­pe­cially in how tech­nol­ogy makes peo­ple so com­fort­able, they stop think­ing crit­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Alden Ehren­re­ich (Solo: A Star Wars Story, 2018) plays John the Sav­age, a man who comes to the city from a far less af­flu­ent place called the Sav­age Lands, and in­tro­duces New Lon­don cit­i­zens such as Len­ina (Jes­sica Brown Find­lay) to ideas and emo­tions that dis­rupt their orderly ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>“And chaos, com­edy, ro­mance and all of that won­der­ful stuff en­sues,” says writer-pro­ducer David Wiener.</p>
    <p>Wiener, who was a pro­ducer on an­other dystopian drama, Fear The Walk­ing Dead (2015 to present), be­lieves Hux­ley’s tale is more rel­e­vant than ever.</p>
    <p>“Hux­ley wrote the book in 1932 and he was pre­scient. He was con­cerned about how hu­mans would use tech­nol­ogy to pre­vent them­selves from be­ing un­com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>“And he wor­ried that that ten­dency would cause peo­ple to be so stim­u­lated, so sex­u­ally sated, so phar­ma­co­log­i­cally numb that they would stop ex­ist­ing in the now – they wouldn’t l ook in­side, or out­side, them­selves to con­sider his­tory and the sys­tems and hi­er­ar­chies around them i n an un­com­fort­able way.”</p>
    <p>One has only to look at how tech­nol­ogy is used now to see that Hux­ley was right to some ex­tent, Wiener says.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we have a lot of tech­no­log­i­cal ways to keep our­selves from con­fronting ideas that don’t align with ours, and we’re pretty good at en­ter­tain­ing our­selves.</p>
    <p>“So it’s one of those rare books that be­comes more rel­e­vant and res­o­nant as time goes on. And now is quite a good mo­ment to have the show on the air.”</p>
    <p>Ehren­re­ich, 30, notes that it is “re­mark­able how much of the source ma­te­rial still stands”.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know how many other books from 1932 we could do a se­ries adap­ta­tion of and keep 70 per cent of the story.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, it was im­por­tant for the show to put its own stamp on the ma­te­rial, says the Beau­ti­ful Crea­tures (2013) star.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been part of a few projects based on source ma­te­rial and, to me, the dan­ger is be­ing too devoted or loyal to the book be­cause the feel­ings you can con­vey through lit­er­a­ture, you can’t just then show those events and ex­pect the same feel­ings to be com­mu­ni­cated on screen.</p>
    <p>“In this, what was won­der­ful was find­ing the emo­tional ex­pe­ri­ence of the book and a way to get those feel­ings across through the vis­ual medium of TV. And up­dat­ing it to our world.”</p>
    <p>In a de­par­ture from the novel, it is re­vealed that John the Sav­age’s mother, Linda – played by Demi Moore (Ghost, 1990) – was once a cit­i­zen of New Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Ehren­re­ich ex­plains that the sav­ages come from a world that is “much closer to the world we live in” – one where peo­ple have not grown up with all the so­cial con­di­tion­ing of New Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“And ‘sav­age’ is just what they call peo­ple who are still full hu­man be­ings, emo­tion­ally,” he says.</p>
    <p>The story then shows how not be­ing con­stantly cush­ioned from life’s sharp edges can strengthen a per­son.</p>
    <p>“John, for all the de­pri­va­tion of all the Sav­age Lands and what a tough world it is, he has de­vel­oped a kind of emo­tional in­tel­li­gence and street smarts.</p>
    <p>“So, once he gets to New Lon­don, as dom­i­nat­ing and in­tim­i­dat­ing as it seems, he be­comes aware very quickly that the peo­ple are in­no­cent, in a way.</p>
    <p>“And it feels creepy for ev­ery­one to be ly­ing and pretending ev­ery­thing’s fine all the time,” the ac­tor says.</p>
    <p>“So, he thinks, ‘This is weird and I’m go­ing to start sc***ing with it.’”</p>
    <p>Brave New World is show­ing on Blue Ant En­ter­tain­ment (StarHub TV Chan­nel 509 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 318).</p>
