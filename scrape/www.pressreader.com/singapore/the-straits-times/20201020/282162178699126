    <p>Par­lia­ment has dis­cussed plans to ex­pand the elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) in­fra­struc­ture. It has been recog­nised that in or­der for the wide adop­tion of EVs to be suc­cess­ful, the charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture has to be ad­e­quately pro­vided first.</p>
    <p>I sin­cerely feel that gov­ern­ment ac­tion is re­quired in this area to over­come the bar­ri­ers in ex­pand­ing the charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture, es­pe­cially in pri­vate de­vel­op­ments such as con­do­mini­ums.</p>
    <p>The pro­vi­sion of EV charg­ing points should be leg­is­lated as a re­quire­ment rather than sub­ject to vot­ing and ap­proval of a spe­cial res­o­lu­tion that has to be tabled at an an­nual gen­eral meet­ing (AGM), and for which a 75 per cent vote in favour of the spe­cial res­o­lu­tion is re­quired be­fore ap­proval is granted, as re­quired un­der the cur­rent Build­ing Main­te­nance and Strata Man­age­ment Act.</p>
    <p>In the last AGM con­ducted at my con­do­minium last month, the spe­cial res­o­lu­tion that had been tabled for the in­stal­la­tion of EV charg­ing points in the base­ment carpark was de­feated, with less than 30 per cent of the res­i­dents sup­port­ing it.</p>
    <p>There was neg­a­tive sen­ti­ment as it did not ben­e­fit the ma­jor­ity of the res­i­dents, es­pe­cially those who did not drive.</p>
    <p>And for those who did drive, they did not own elec­tric ve­hi­cles and saw no in­cen­tive to sup­port the res­o­lu­tion, even though there was no tech­ni­cal dif­fi­culty in pro­vid­ing such an in­stal­la­tion and it did not in­con­ve­nience them or af­fect them neg­a­tively.</p>
    <p>As rec­om­mended by the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity’s tech­nol­ogy road map on elec­tro­mo­bil­ity, the Gov­ern­ment should use a mix of reg­u­la­tory, fi­nan­cial and non-fi­nan­cial pol­icy levers to sup­port the growth of EVs in Singapore.</p>
    <p>These poli­cies should be cre­ated and an­nounced ex­pe­di­ently, so that there is clar­ity on the reg­u­la­tory frame­work, which would be con­ducive for the pro­vi­sion of EV charg­ing points in pri­vate de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the lux­ury of be­ing able to in­stall EV charg­ing sta­tions at their own homes is lim­ited to only the mi­nor­ity who live in landed prop­er­ties. The Gov­ern­ment should make it eas­ier for all Sin­ga­pore­ans who wish to own EVs, with the con­ve­nience of hav­ing charg­ing points at their res­i­dences or close to their res­i­dences, so that they can charge their EVs overnight.</p>
