    <p>• Few ex­pected Zine­dine Zi­dane to leave Real Madrid and even fewer ex­pected him to come back as coach. And yet al­most 500 days later, he has won the La Liga ti­tle, with­out fuss, with­out even all the sign­ings he was promised.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, in an empty Al­fredo di Ste­fano Sta­dium, he lifted an­other tro­phy, his sec­ond La Liga ti­tle and 11th over­all as coach.</p>
    <p>The 2-1 win over Vil­lar­real, cour­tesy of a brace by Karim Ben­zema, was Real’s 10th straight vic­tory in as many games since last month’s restart fol­low­ing the Covid hia­tus.</p>
    <p>Their first league ti­tle since 2017 will not go down as the most thrilling but to Zi­dane, it tastes sweeter than any of the three Cham­pi­ons League crowns he has led Real to.</p>
    <p>On win­ning their 34th league ti­tle, t he French­man, who was tossed into the air by his ju­bi­lant play­ers, said: “The Cham­pi­ons League is the Cham­pi­ons League but La Liga makes me hap­pier, be­cause La Liga is what it’s all about.</p>
    <p>“This is a tremen­dous feel­ing be­cause what these play­ers have done is in­cred­i­ble. I am lost for words be­cause I am too emo­tional.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been the best be­cause we have got the most points (86 with one game to play) and that’s all there is to say.</p>
    <p>“For me, it’s one of my best days as a profession­al. The play­ers are the ones who have fought for this. It’s true that I’ve played my role, but they are the ones who be­lieve in what they are do­ing.</p>
    <p>“The first one (2017) was phe­nom­e­nal but this one has a par­tic­u­lar flavour. Af­ter two months at home, we re­turned, we pre­pared our­selves in a dif­fer­ent way. And we won a league, which is the most dif­fi­cult thing to win.</p>
    <p>“It comes from a lot of sac­ri­fice.” While the team will not be do­ing their usual open-top bus pa­rade to the Ci­beles Foun­tain in Madrid be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Zi­dane ded­i­cated the ti­tle to their fans, who have been barred from at­tend­ing games since the restart.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure ev­ery­one is happy in their homes tonight. The fans al­ways love to see the team win and we’ve done this for them.”</p>
    <p>When Zi­dane was reappointe­d in March last year, Real pres­i­dent Florentino Perez boasted the 1998 World Cup win­ner had come again to launch “a glo­ri­ous new era”.</p>
    <p>It was a bold as­ser­tion as even their for­mer player’s re­turn could not sal­vage a dis­as­trous year in which they sacked two coaches, Julen Lopetegui and San­ti­ago So­lari, and fin­ished tro­phy­less for the first time since the 2009-10 cam­paign.</p>
    <p>But he stead­ied the ship and, al­though Perez failed to make good on his prom­ises to sign a num­ber of megas­tars dur­ing last sum­mer’s pre-sea­son – Eden Haz­ard was the only big-name ar­rival for €100 mil­lion (S$158 mil­lion) – Real have kept up their form since Christ­mas, while arch-ri­vals Barcelona fal­tered.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing wit­nessed his im­pact on the team in two sep­a­rate coach­ing spells, Real skip­per Ser­gio Ramos be­lieves that Zi­dane, who on av­er­age wins a tro­phy ev­ery 19 games, has the Mi­das touch.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing he touches turns into gold,” said the Spain de­fender, who re­vealed his in­ten­tion was to end his ca­reer at the San­ti­ago Bern­abeu. “We be­lieve in him and in his work. He’s the one who has to make the dif­fer­ence, he’s a per­son who trusts play­ers, and few do.</p>
    <p>“We hope he stays here for a very long time. He is unique.”</p>
