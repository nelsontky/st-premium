    <p>The Gov­ern­ment and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies that pay the hospi­tal bills are try­ing ev­ery which way to keep peo­ple here health­ier.</p>
    <p>Life ex­pectancy in Sin­ga­pore is one of the longest in the world. The peo­ple en­joy the most num­ber of healthy years in the world at 73.9 years in 2019 – beat­ing the Ja­panese, who were sec­ond with 73.3 years of good health.</p>
    <p>This is largely due to three main fac­tors – a strong health­care sys­tem to pro­vide good med­i­cal care to all who need it, in a timely man­ner; a ro­bust im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­gramme to pro­tect against many pre­ventable dis­eases; and peo­ple fol­low­ing a healthy life­style that re­duces their risk of se­ri­ous ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has an ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able pub­lic health net­work, with heavy gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies that en­sure no cit­i­zen is de­nied health­care for the lack of money.</p>
    <p>The na­tional im­mu­ni­sa­tion sched­ule here rec­om­mends that all chil­dren be pro­tected against 10 dis­eases, with some like diph­the­ria and measles be­ing com­pul­sory. Most are free.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) has also in­tro­duced, just this month, sub­si­dies for adult im­mu­ni­sa­tion. This will hope­fully re­duce the num­ber of peo­ple get­ting se­ri­ous ill­nesses like menin­gi­tis and pneu­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>But the third fac­tor has to come from peo­ple them­selves. They need to ex­er­cise reg­u­larly and avoid eat­ing un­healthy food, or at least, not eat it too fre­quently.</p>
    <p>Most are aware that reg­u­lar ex­er­cise is ex­tremely help­ful in keep­ing them in good health. They know it re­duces obe­sity, the risk of heart dis­eases and di­a­betes, med­i­cal con­di­tions which re­sult in sig­nif­i­cant in­sur­ance claims.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Tan, who heads Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore, which pro­vides MediShield Life in­te­grated plans, said the top three causes of claims are heart prob­lems, stroke and kid­ney treat­ments. In Sin­ga­pore, the ma­jor­ity of kid­ney fail­ure cases are due to un­con­trolled di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar ex­er­cise could re­duce the risk for all three. But not ev­ery­one who knows that, ac­tu­ally makes the ef­fort to ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>The Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB) has over the years stressed the im­por­tance of ex­er­cise. The board’s Na­tional Steps Chal­lenge has seen the num­ber of par­tic­i­pants grow, from 156,000 in 2015 when it was launched to 913,000 in the fifth session that ended ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The HPB dan­gles in­cen­tives for those who sign up. They in­clude a free steps tracker for those who do not have one, as well as prizes like air tick­ets for teams and in­di­vid­u­als. There are also vouch­ers for those who ful­fil the re­quired num­ber of daily steps.</p>
    <p>Mr Zee Yoong Kang, HPB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, sees noth­ing wrong in giv­ing peo­ple in­cen­tives to ex­er­cise. But he added: “I don’t think peo­ple do it for money. I think it’s the thrill of get­ting that voucher as a recog­ni­tion.”</p>
    <p>That’s be­cause “to earn $35 in our steps chal­lenge pro­gramme, you have to walk 960km, and that’s all the way from Sin­ga­pore to Thai­land”, he said.</p>
    <p>The an­nual event in­volves a se­ries of chal­lenges with par­tic­i­pants se­cur­ing a $5 or $10 voucher for clear­ing a level.</p>
    <p>While some peo­ple do man­age to earn ev­ery sin­gle voucher of­fered, there are also oth­ers who do not claim them after clear­ing a level.</p>
    <p>About a third of par­tic­i­pants would claim the vouch­ers within a month of qual­i­fy­ing for them, while 7 per cent do not bother at all.</p>
    <p>Any­thing that can get more peo­ple ex­er­cis­ing reg­u­larly is good. While about half a mil­lion par­tic­i­pants may not care much about the vouch­ers, there are about 300,000 peo­ple who had likely ex­er­cised more to get them.</p>
    <p>It is far cheaper to pro­vide a lit­tle in­cen­tive for peo­ple to stay healthy, than to treat them for a med­i­cal con­di­tion that could have been pre­vented.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the MOH Of­fice for Health­care Trans­for­ma­tion, said the re­wards can be seen “as en­cour­age­ment, sup­port, to as­sist peo­ple in mak­ing the be­havioural change”.</p>
    <p>Such en­cour­age­ment is im­por­tant, which is why Pru­den­tial in­tro­duced its Pulse app this year. It al­ready has over 120,000 users.</p>
    <p>The app al­lows peo­ple to check their health sta­tus as well as ac­cess a tele-con­sul­ta­tion should they think they have a prob­lem. It was launched dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when most peo­ple stayed home as far as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>There are also fun el­e­ments in the app, like a wrin­kle-mir­ror, to en­cour­age peo­ple to lead healthy life­styles.</p>
    <p>For health in­sur­ers like Pru­den­tial, spend­ing money to get peo­ple to stay fit would mean health­ier pol­i­cy­hold­ers, which is good for the bot­tom line.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said more than a third of se­ri­ous ill­nesses are ac­tu­ally pre­ventable. This means, if we all do our part, we should be able to en­joy even more years in good health in our increasing­ly long life­times.</p>
    <p>Mr Den­nis Tan, who heads Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore, which pro­vides MediShield Life in­te­grated plans, said the top three causes of claims are heart prob­lems, stroke and kid­ney treat­ments. In Sin­ga­pore, the ma­jor­ity of kid­ney fail­ure cases are due to un­con­trolled di­a­betes. Reg­u­lar ex­er­cise could re­duce the risk for all three. But not ev­ery­one who knows that, ac­tu­ally makes the ef­fort to ex­er­cise.</p>
