    <p>Th­ese 10 re­leases by Sin­ga­porean acts in the past month in­clude new ones by some of the stal­warts of the ex­per­i­men­tal mu­sic scene – The Ob­ser­va­tory, Kelvin Tan and Ge­orge Chua. There are also new names – jazz band Evo­lu­tion Quar­tet and singer/pro­ducer Keat – with de­but re­leases.</p>
    <p>1 ALTERNATIV­E/EX­PER­I­MEN­TAL SERENDIPIT­IES FOR THE DARK­NESS – THE COVID SONGS/ THE CLOUDS ARE BLEED­ING,</p>
    <p>AND WE ALL CAN’T BREATHE/ YOUR WORD IN MY HEART/ THE BEAUTY, METAMORPHO­SISED/ A NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</p>
    <p>Kelvin Tan</p>

    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/3iPeWhJ</p>
    <p>Alternativ­e mu­sic stal­wart Kelvin Tan’s (left) lat­est batch of five al­bums are di­vided into pre- and post-cir­cuit breaker mu­sic.</p>
    <p>His first sin­gle, the bluesy I Hope I Don’t Get (The Covid), is taken from one of the al­bums, Serendipit­ies For The Dark­ness – The Covid Songs, which com­prises post-cir­cuit breaker mu­sic. The song, which has a mu­sic video, is his trib­ute to black mu­sic, specif­i­cally the early blues of the Mississipp­i Delta.</p>
    <p>His other post-cir­cuit breaker work – The Clouds Are Bleed­ing, And We All Can’t Breathe (above) – con­sists of elec­tric gui­tar im­pro­vi­sa­tions which he dubs “the most in­tense in­stru­men­tal al­bum I’ve ever recorded”.</p>
    <p>The other three al­bums have works cre­ated be­fore the cir­cuit breaker. The im­pro­vised songs in Your</p>
    <p>Word In My Heart are in­spired by words from the Bi­ble’s Book of Psalms and ded­i­cated to his 88-year-old mother, Madam Tan Phaik In.</p>
    <p>The other two al­bums are The Beauty, Metamorpho­sised, which features im­pro­vised songs styled like a “long mu­si­cal nar­ra­tive poem” and A New Heaven And New Earth, an elec­tric-gui­tar of­fer­ing in­spired by the Bi­ble’s Book Of Rev­e­la­tions.</p>
    <p>2 ELEC­TRONIC/POP/DANCE AWE</p>
    <p>The Ana­log Girl</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/346RWEO</p>
    <p>Singer, song­writer and elec­tronic mu­si­cian The Ana­log Girl took four years to record her fifth and lat­est al­bum, Awe.</p>
    <p>The artist, whose real name is Mei Wong, says the songs were in­spired by theme songs from 1970s and 1980s tele­vi­sion shows such as com­edy/drama The Love Boat (1977 to 1987), as well as acts such as disco vet­eran Glo­ria Gaynor and dance-pop icon Kylie Minogue.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally just wanted to make tracks that I could dance to and fall in love with all at the same time,” she says, adding that tracks such as Your Mind, De­vo­tion and How re­volve around feel­ings of love and at­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>3 POP/ELEC­TRONIC</p>
    <p>I WAS DUMB BUT NOW IM WOKE</p>
    <p>Keat</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3n2OWC4</p>
    <p>Singer-song­writer and elec­tronic pro­ducer Keat’s de­but EP, I Was Dumb But Now Im Woke, in­cludes his lat­est sin­gle, Good Friend. The song is a col­lab­o­ra­tion with Zionn, who is also the EP’s pri­mary pro­ducer and mu­sic direc­tor.</p>
    <p>“In many ways, the fi­nal sin­gle em­bod­ies much of what this EP is about: A message of self-love and lib­er­a­tion and also a chron­i­cle of the growth I’ve made as an artist and a per­son through my per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ences in love,” Keat says.</p>
    <p>“It’s been quite a crazy journey, and my most im­por­tant an­chors came in the form of the peo­ple I’ve been priv­i­leged to call my friends.”</p>
    <p>Keat is among the bud­ding young tal­ents who are part of Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s Noise Mu­sic Men­tor­ship Pro­gramme 2020 and was men­tored by home-grown mu­si­cian, DJ and pro­ducer Kaye.</p>
    <p>4 EX­PER­I­MEN­TAL/ AVANT GARDE/ROCK AUTHOR­ITY IS ALIVE</p>
    <p>Haino Keiji & The Ob­ser­va­tory</p>
    <p>Hear it on: ujikaji.band­camp.com and theob­ser­va­tory.band­camp.com Watch it on: bit.ly/2SlIDeR</p>
    <p>Author­ity Is Alive is a new col­lab­o­ra­tive al­bum by Ja­panese avant-garde and psy­che­delic mu­sic vet­eran Keiji Haino and Sin­ga­pore ex­per­i­men­tal band The Ob­ser­va­tory. The tracks were recorded live at the 2019 edi­tion of Playfreely, a se­ries of con­certs pre­sented by The Ob­ser­va­tory that features Asian ex­per­i­men­tal mu­sic artists.</p>
    <p>Their joint per­for­mance was unan­nounced and spon­ta­neous, with Haino ad-lib­bing from a self-writ­ten poem and play­ing gui­tar, ac­com­pa­nied by The Ob­ser­va­tory mem­bers Dharma and Yuen Chee Wai on gui­tars and Cheryl Ong on drums.</p>
    <p>Both the vinyl and dig­i­tal ver­sions of the al­bum are on sale through record la­bel Ujikaji and The Ob­ser­va­tory’s Band­camp pages.</p>
    <p>5 JAZZ RE­FLEC­TIONS</p>
    <p>Evo­lu­tion Quar­tet</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3n07XVF</p>
    <p>Re­flec­tions is the de­but al­bum by Evo­lu­tion Quar­tet, a jazz band com­pris­ing pi­anist Cheryl Ann Spencer (above), drum­mer Ta­m­agoh on drums, flautist Rit Xu and dou­ble bass player Fabian Lee. New York-based trum­peter Alex Sip­i­a­gin also per­forms as a guest artist.</p>
    <p>Spencer, who used to work in the bank­ing in­dus­try, says: “We are re­ally thrilled to be able to launch this al­bum as it is a cul­mi­na­tion of our ef­forts from play­ing to­gether, em­bark­ing on the creative process and ex­plor­ing the idea of orig­i­nal com­po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>“We love jazz and re­ally hope we can con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore’s jazz scene, mak­ing it more con­ducive for ev­ery­one to en­joy, ap­pre­ci­ate and even learn about this genre of mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>The six orig­i­nal com­po­si­tions in­clude Evo­lu­tion, in­spired by the Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens’ Evo­lu­tion Gar­den, and My Papa, an ode to Spencer’s late fa­ther, Mr Teo Chin Huat, for­mer pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Mu­sic Teach­ers As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The al­bum also in­cludes a ren­di­tion of My Favourite Things, a clas­sic from the 1959 mu­si­cal film The Sound Of Mu­sic .</p>
    <p>6 ROCK/FOLK</p>
    <p>RE­VIS­IT­ING THE BAL­LAD OF BUKIT BROWN</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Lee x Laremy Lee Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/3jduWtW</p>
    <p>Rock ‘n’ roll quar­tet Gen­eral Lee team up with writer Laremy Lee (above, cen­tre) for Re­vis­it­ing The Bal­lad Of Bukit Brown, an up­dated ver­sion of a song that first ap­peared on their epony­mous 2016 al­bum. The tune pays trib­ute to the ceme­tery known as the rest­ing place of some of Sin­ga­pore’s pi­o­neers.</p>
    <p>The video features Lee read­ing out Re­vis­it­ing, a poem he penned in re­sponse to the song. The poem is writ­ten in the Twin Cin­ema form, where its two col­umns are halved down the mid­dle and can be read sep­a­rately or to­gether.</p>
    <p>Footage of both con­tem­po­rary and old Sin­ga­pore is shown in the video, ex­plor­ing the ten­sion be­tween conservati­on and progress.</p>
    <p>7 POP/SOUL PERIBADIMU Huda</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/305zc7k</p>
    <p>Singer-ac­tress Huda, a con­tes­tant on Sin­ga­pore Idol 3, has re­leased a mu­sic video for her sin­gle Peribadimu (Your Per­son­al­ity).</p>
    <p>In­spired by the fra­grances of berg­amot, gera­nium, ylang ylang and patchouli, the song topped lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion Ria 89.7FM’s for four weeks when it dropped in March.</p>
    <p>The sin­gle, re­leased by lo­cal mu­sic com­pany Mosta Records, was mas­tered by Bill Sk­ibbe from Third Man Mas­ter­ing, an Amer­i­can stu­dio run by multi-Grammy win­ning rocker Jack White.</p>
    <p>8 DEATH METAL/CRUST PUNK BENT BENEV­O­LENCE</p>
    <p>Off­set</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3kXa370</p>
    <p>Death­punk quar­tet Off­set recorded their four-track EP, Bent Benev­o­lence, live at TNT Stu­dio, which has been a haven for home-grown un­der­ground bands since the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the dig­i­tal edi­tions, the band have also put out vinyl copies in three colours – baby blue, hot pink and black – sold through their Band­camp page. The cover features art­work by Ja­panese manga artist Shin­taro Kago.</p>
    <p>9 ELEC­TRONIC/EX­PER­I­MEN­TAL SMOKE­SCREEN</p>
    <p>Ge­orge Chua</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3kJpEXF</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic and ex­per­i­men­tal mu­si­cian Ge­orge Chua, whose mu­sic dates back to the 1990s, is back with a new al­bum, Smoke­screen.</p>
    <p>His inspiratio­n for the post-techno songs range from French philosophe­r Paul Vir­ilio to char­ac­ters from wuxia films. One of the songs, Neo Pung­gol, features a mu­sic video di­rected by new me­dia artist Yey­oon Avis Ann.</p>
    <p>10 SOUL/POP FU­TURE ME + U</p>
    <p>Dru Chen</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/2S4PSHJ</p>
    <p>An ode to long-last­ing love, singer-song­writer Dru Chen’s ro­man­tic bal­lad Fu­ture Me + U merges the warmth of clas­sic soul-pop with mod­ern stylings.</p>
    <p>The tune is about “the life­time com­mit­ment of putting one’s faith in an­other”, he says. “The con­sis­tent thread through­out all of my mu­sic has been a fo­cus on groove and soul­ful sing­ing, but this lat­est sin­gle ups the ante in mod­ern sonic qual­ity and lyric writ­ing.”</p>
