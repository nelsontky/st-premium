    <p>Thank­ing health­care work­ers was not enough for Mr Adrian Tan.</p>
    <p>The head of Ad Planet Group, Sin­ga­pore’s largest lo­cal in­de­pen­dent com­mu­ni­ca­tion agency, cor­ralled the cre­ative forces of his team in May – when Sin­ga­pore was in the midst of the cir­cuit breaker – to “do some­thing more”.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is a one-stop on­line plat­form called Lions of Health­care We Thank You, which was launched last Wednesday and en­cour­ages com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore to re­ward health­care staff with life­style treats.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, 64, says: “It all started in April, when my wife and I dis­cussed how we could play a role in sup­port­ing the needs of health­care staff, who showed such great ded­i­ca­tion and sac­ri­fice de­spite the dan­gers they faced test­ing and treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>Although health­care staff were swel­ter­ing un­der per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, they did not buckle un­der pressure, ob­served the cou­ple.</p>
    <p>For the por­tal, he formed a team from Ad Planet, which in­cluded his wife Tan Shook Wah; Mr Colt Seow, lead of cre­ative strat­egy; ac­count di­rec­tor Li­nus Lui; cre­ative di­rec­tor Des­mond Kuah; art di­rec­tor Siow Han Sheng; and copy­writer Kevin Ho.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of safe-dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, the team met on video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom, cold­called en­ter­prises for sup­port and sent out e-mails.</p>
    <p>It took about two months for busi­nesses to come on board.</p>
    <p>“For health­care staff, down­time and sim­ple plea­sures are a lux­ury, given the hec­tic na­ture of their work,” Mr Tan says.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of Covid-19 cases here has sur­passed 54,000, the num­ber of deaths, at 27, makes Sin­ga­pore one of the coun­tries with the low­est mor­tal­ity rate.</p>
    <p>This is some­thing Mr Tan says speaks vol­umes about the ded­i­ca­tion of the na­tion’s health­care staff.</p>
    <p>Ad Planet has cu­rated 139 of­fers from 118 en­ter­prises on the plat­form, with more ex­pected af­ter the launch to in­clude ser­vices that will ap­peal to the dif­fer­ent life­styles and pref­er­ences of health­care staff.</p>
    <p>One of the en­ter­prise part­ners, Mr Mark Shaw, chair­man of the</p>
    <p>Or­chard Road Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (Orba), be­lieves that the ini­tia­tive comes at a time when sol­i­dar­ity and sup­port within the com­mu­nity for front-line staff are key.</p>
    <p>“Orba is hum­bled to have an op­por­tu­nity to give back and play a role in ac­knowl­edg­ing our health­care work­force,” says the 51-yearold.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with our Or­chard Road stake­hold­ers, exclusive bun­dle deals and pro­mo­tions have been de­signed es­pe­cially for our front-line and health­care heroes, who have shown their ded­i­ca­tion and hard work in pro­tect­ing public health and keep­ing our na­tion safe.”</p>
    <p>Other en­ter­prise part­ners in­clude lead­ing ho­tels, food and bev­er­age out­lets, fash­ion and beauty houses, and en­ergy com­pany Sem­b­corp.</p>
    <p>Mrs Tan, 63, says: “Each en­ter­prise de­cides how it wishes to ex­press its thanks, and we are reach­ing out to a wide range of com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>Ben­e­fits of­fered on the por­tal run the gamut from spa ses­sions to din­ing dis­count vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts is of­fer­ing health­care staff a 50 per cent dis­count on rooms, while the Teyst Group of restau­rants, which includes La Mensa, The Daily Cut and Mucha­chos, has shaved off half the price of meals.</p>
    <p>Nurs­ing of­fi­cer El­iz­a­beth Phua from Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal is one of the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the ini­tia­tive. Dur­ing the pan­demic, apart from the stress­ful work sit­u­a­tion, she could not meet friends or even share a meal with col­leagues at break times.</p>
    <p>“It hasn’t been easy for us,” says Ms Phua, who is in her early 30s.</p>
    <p>“Now that some re­stric­tions are lifted, we are re­ally ap­pre­cia­tive that we can start to en­joy the many exclusive of­fers from Lions of Health­care.”</p>
    <p>The plat­form is ac­ces­si­ble to the more than 60,000 health­care work­ers from over 40 hospi­tals and health­care in­sti­tu­tions, in­clud­ing the Na­tional Health­care Group, Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem (NUHS) and SingHealth clus­ters, as well as from the pri­vate sec­tor, such as the IHH Health­care Group and Raf­fles Med­i­cal Group.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Yeoh Khay Guan, 57, chief ex­ec­u­tive of NUHS, says: “The sup­port and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the com­mu­nity en­cour­age us and give us re­newed strength in the on­go­ing fight against Covid-19.”</p>
