    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems are set for a fun­da­men­tal re­think, as we fig­ure out how to in­te­grate dig­i­tal de­vices into teach­ing. Ac­knowl­edg­ing this, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said last month dur­ing a Face­book Live ses­sion called Af­ter the Pan­demic: Reimag­in­ing Ed­u­ca­tion that “we are now think­ing through how we can im­ple­ment blended learn­ing into our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem start­ing next year”.</p>
    <p>In­deed, blended learn­ing – in­volv­ing a mix of face-to-face and re­mote on­line teach­ing – is the be­gin­ning of a new ap­proach to build­ing re­silience in the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem in the post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>The fu­ture is be­com­ing more volatile and more un­pre­dictable. Blended learn­ing helps en­sure that the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem stays open so that learn­ing can con­tinue through these dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>MANY POS­I­TIVES</p>
    <p>This hy­brid mode of pro­vid­ing ed­u­ca­tion has the abil­ity to cre­ate a bet­ter learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, as well as re­tain the im­por­tant so­cial in­ter­ac­tions that schools pro­vide.</p>
    <p>As the min­is­ter him­self said: “Teach­ing and learn­ing in schools is in many ways a so­cial and re­la­tional process.”</p>
    <p>It is a re­bal­anc­ing of ap­proaches and is based on the be­lief that teach­ers of­fer in­valu­able hu­man and emo­tional con­nec­tion, em­pa­thy and sup­port. The friendly in­ter­ac­tions they pro­vide are harder in a com­pletely on­line en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Any pol­icy change that is an an­swer to a prob­lem has its own goals and is at best a trade-off among avail­able op­tions, com­ing with a set of costs and ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Blended learn­ing pre­pares stu­dents, teach­ers and par­ents for a sit­u­a­tion where schools could switch quickly and seam­lessly from one mode of learn­ing to an­other in the event of any dis­rup­tion – such as ex­am­i­na­tions and mark­ing (for na­tional ex­am­i­na­tions), floods, trans­port break­downs or even an­other pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­ri­ence is a fast teacher. For ex­am­ple, those coun­tries that were hit by the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome out­break in March 2003 were psy­cho­log­i­cally and med­i­cally more pre­pared to han­dle Covid-19 than coun­tries or lead­ers who had not been through the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>HOW IT WOULD WORK</p>
    <p>What would a blended learn­ing sce­nario look like if Sin­ga­pore had three days of face-to-face school­ing and two days of home-based learn­ing weekly – per­haps start­ing with sec­ondary schools?</p>
    <p>How would home learn­ing days be de­signed mean­ing­fully for stu­dents? Would they be a repli­ca­tion of school-based learn­ing, or would they evolve into some­thing more ex­pe­ri­en­tial and out-of-home and out-of-school?</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, stu­dents could be given tasks in the mall, zoo or com­mu­nity cen­tre, to dis­cuss the next day in school. It could be un­der­stand­ing a con­cept through a video, or ex­per­i­ments car­ried out in prac­tice. It could in­clude an im­mer­sive learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence us­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and vir­tual re­al­ity modes, and so on.</p>
    <p>This ap­proach not only cre­ates in­di­vid­u­al­i­sa­tion, but also stu­dents may feel a sense of con­trol over their time, place and pace of learn­ing. Their readi­ness may vary but the les­son de­sign en­dows them the per­sonal agency over when and how they want to learn.</p>
    <p>This is an im­por­tant as­pect of self-learn­ing and life­long learn­ing.</p>
    <p>As The New York Times colum­nist Thomas Fried­man re­cently wrote: “The most crit­i­cal role for K-12 ed­u­ca­tors, there­fore, will be to equip young peo­ple with the cu­rios­ity and pas­sion to be life­long learn­ers who feel own­er­ship over their ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to con­struc­tivist the­o­rists, learn­ing in­volves the cre­ation of mean­ing based on prior ex­pe­ri­ences and prior knowl­edge. What we know about the real world arises from the way in which we in­ter­pret our ex­pe­ri­ences. For learn­ers to do this, they must build on the char­ac­ter­is­tics of in­de­pen­dent learn­ing and the skills of self-di­rec­tion. This in­volves recog­nis­ing their abil­i­ties and lim­i­ta­tions and be­ing ca­pa­ble of con­struct­ing learn­ing pro­cesses – to de­fine goals, make plans and im­ple­ment them.</p>
    <p>The blended mode of learn­ing can­not solve all the is­sues that stu­dents and fam­i­lies face.</p>
    <p>Still, some of the psy­cho­log­i­cal traits that in­flu­ence learn­ing are mo­ti­va­tion, in­ter­est, re­silience, and adapt­abil­ity – and the blended mode could en­able stu­dents to study at a pace that suits them, not one dic­tated by the school en­vi­ron­ment. It is well-known that en­gage­ment drops when chil­dren try to learn at times that are not con­ducive for them.</p>
    <p>HOME STUDY IS­SUES</p>
    <p>How do we en­sure home en­vi­ron­ments are spa­ces that are con­ducive to self-di­rected study and en­able stu­dents to ef­fec­tively pre­pare for learn­ing while not in school?</p>
    <p>A class­room is rel­a­tively “uni­form” in phys­i­cal con­di­tions, un­like stu­dents’ homes. Can home spa­ces pro­vide a calm zone which pro­motes a com­fort­able tran­si­tion with school? Can homes sup­port or hin­der stu­dents’ phys­i­cal, men­tal and emo­tional well-be­ing?</p>
    <p>We al­ready know that some homes are not safe or con­ducive en­vi­ron­ments for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Will some stu­dents con­tinue to come back to school on “home learn­ing” days, even if their par­ents are at home? Com­mu­nity spa­ces have pro­vided some stu­dents refuge from dis­rup­tive home en­vi­ron­ments and other dis­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry’s best ef­forts to man­age in­fra­struc­ture and tech­ni­cal is­sues dur­ing the home-based learn­ing pe­riod, the Covid-19 cri­sis ex­posed some so­ci­etal dif­fer­ences. Home sup­port does not end with a de­vice and last-mile con­nec­tiv­ity – parental sup­port is equally nec­es­sary in sup­port­ing on­line learn­ing.</p>
    <p>For par­ents, there is cer­tainly a need to part­ner more ac­tively with the school to en­rich chil­dren’s learn­ing. This is where the great­est in­equities oc­cur, due to so­cio-eco­nomic con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Self-help groups play an im­por­tant role in mit­i­gat­ing such in­equal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Par­ents do need to take on mul­ti­ple roles as an ob­server and in­struc­tor; they also fa­cil­i­tate di­rec­tions for chil­dren. Par­ents will also have a win­dow into what kind of learner their child is and can sup­port them ac­cord­ingly – for ex­am­ple, in learn­ing maths con­cepts or to take on more read­ing. Af­ter sup­port­ing the child for a few ses­sions, par­ents do not need to hover over the child all day, but should in­stead en­cour­age them to start as­sum­ing own­er­ship of their school­work.</p>
    <p>There could be chil­dren who sim­ply do not know how to self-reg­u­late alone and will there­fore need scaf­fold­ing, with a struc­ture and frame­work. The par­ents’ role in facilitati­on is cru­cial here.</p>
    <p>In the case of younger chil­dren, they would not them­selves know, with­out guid­ance, how and where to nav­i­gate on­line. There could be par­ents who re­ally do not know how to fa­cil­i­tate as well, and the chil­dren are then left to their own de­vices.</p>
    <p>As we build re­silience into our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, we must be mind­ful that we do not in­ad­ver­tently build in even more dis­par­i­ties in out­comes, be­cause school­ing and ed­u­ca­tion is still the great­est so­cial lev­eller.</p>
    <p>Home sup­port does not end with a de­vice and last-mile con­nec­tiv­ity – parental sup­port is equally nec­es­sary in sup­port­ing on­line learn­ing.</p>
    <p>For par­ents, there is cer­tainly a need to part­ner more ac­tively with the school to en­rich chil­dren’s learn­ing. This is where the great­est in­equities oc­cur, due to so­cio-eco­nomic con­di­tions.</p>
