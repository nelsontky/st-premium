    <p>A new com­put­erised sys­tem for the move­ment of goods across six Asean coun­tries con­nected by land was in­au­gu­rated yes­ter­day and there are plans to ex­pand it to in­clude the re­main­ing mem­bers of the re­gional group­ing, as well as other forms of trans­port.</p>
    <p>The Asean Cus­toms Tran­sit Sys­tem (Acts), an on­line tran­sit man­age­ment sys­tem which was of­fi­cially launched at a vir­tual event, aims to make the over­land trans­port of goods more ef­fi­cient and at a lower cost, with­out the need to make re­peated cus­toms dec­la­ra­tions or change of ve­hi­cles at each bor­der. Traders can now carry out a sin­gle tran­sit jour­ney across par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries – Cam­bo­dia, Laos, Malaysia, Sin­ga­pore, Thai­land and Viet­nam – via a sin­gle truck, cus­toms dec­la­ra­tion and banker’s guar­an­tee.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch event, Asean sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lim Jock Hoi said the sys­tem – which has been op­er­a­tional since Nov 2 – will en­hance Asean’s trade and pro­duc­tion net­works, as well as es­tab­lish a more uni­fied mar­ket for its firms and con­sumers.</p>
    <p>He said that hav­ing the sys­tem could also sup­port the re­sponse to Covid-19 by ac­cel­er­at­ing the move­ment of med­i­cal sup­plies, vac­cines and per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment within mem­ber states. “Un­der the sim­pli­fied regime and cus­toms co­op­er­a­tion of the Acts, the move­ment of emer­gency health­care goods and sup­plies can be fa­cil­i­tated across na­tional borders with­out the need for cus­toms guar­an­tees dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Myan­mar is ex­pected to join the sys­tem next year, added Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>Fea­si­bil­ity stud­ies are also be­ing done for Brunei, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines to join in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Acts was de­vel­oped to help re­alise the Asean goals of re­duc­ing trade trans­ac­tion costs by 10 per cent in three years from 2017, and dou­bling in­tra-Asean trade be­tween 2017 and 2025.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses can lodge e-tran­sit dec­la­ra­tions di­rectly with Asean cus­toms au­thor­i­ties, and track the move­ment of their goods from load­ing at de­par­ture to its fi­nal des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try di­rec­tor-gen­eral of trade Ng Bee Kim said the suc­cess­ful launch of Acts is a tes­ta­ment to Asean’s com­mit­ment to strengthen sup­ply chain con­nec­tiv­ity in re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic. She stressed that it was cru­cial to un­der­take more out­reach ef­forts to cre­ate more aware­ness of the sys­tem among pri­vate firms.</p>
    <p>“As we gain ex­pe­ri­ence and con­fi­dence, I hope and look for­ward to the ex­pan­sion of Acts to bring even wider ben­e­fits to our traders in Asean,” she said, rais­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of in­cor­po­rat­ing other modes of trans­port, such as sea and air, into the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem is man­aged by a per­ma­nent team based in the Asean Sec­re­tar­iat in Jakarta. It has re­ceived sup­port from the Euro­pean Union in the form of tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise and €10 mil­lion (S$16 mil­lion) in fund­ing for Acts since 2012.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Mandl, who is a team leader at the Asean Re­gional In­te­gra­tion Sup­port from the Euro­pean Union Plus pro­gramme, said that the pan­demic called for a re­think­ing of the idea of global sup­ply chains, with more em­pha­sis now on re­gional ones.</p>
    <p>“Acts can bring about part of the shift, I think, we will see in the longer term of re­gional sup­ply chains, fa­cil­i­tat­ing the move­ment of goods man­u­fac­tured in Asean for other Asean mar­kets.”</p>
