    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis and the USChina trade con­flict present an op­por­tu­nity for Asean to emerge as a grow­ing mar­ket of end de­mand and a re­silient base of pro­duc­tion, Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shanmugara­tnam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Fun­da­men­tally, we have now the op­por­tu­nity of build­ing a more re­silient and more in­te­grated Asian sup­ply chain, in other words, an Asian pro­duc­tion re­gion, as well as Asian mar­kets that are open to the world,” he said at the Stan­dard Char­tered Asean Busi­ness Fo­rum, held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>The re­gion can “be­come an ex­am­ple of how through open­ness, in­te­gra­tion, and risk man­age­ment of sup­ply chains, we can re­ally have a win-win, first for those of us within Asia, within Asean, and also for the rest of the world”, he noted.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said trade ten­sions have been ris­ing for some time and will out­last the coronaviru­s pan­demic and the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>US-China re­la­tions have de­te­ri­o­rated rapidly across a broad range of issues, with both sides shut­ting down con­sulates, and en­gag­ing in diplo­matic tus­sles over Hong Kong and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>The United States is also push­ing for a ban on Chi­nese tech firms in­clud­ing ByteDance, the owner of TikTok.</p>
    <p>The clash between the world’s two largest economies has sparked global fears of a new Cold War that might drag trade and the global econ­omy deeper into re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>“The trends lead­ing to a wors­en­ing of US-China re­la­tion­ship pre­dates the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion and will very likely or al­most cer­tainly post-date the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion. Fun­da­men­tal rea­sons are do­mes­tic, but do­mes­tic di­vides ex­press them­selves po­lit­i­cally very of­ten in terms of hos­til­ity to­wards oth­ers in the rest of the world. China is, of course, a con­ve­nient foe,” Mr Thar­man said.</p>
    <p>He added that the prospect of an early res­o­lu­tion of cur­rent ten­sions is not very high.</p>
    <p>“Both the US and China will have to make ad­just­ments and will have to do so in ways that are not just about bi­lat­eral give and take but about strength­en­ing the mul­ti­lat­eral sys­tem be­cause it is in their own in­ter­est. And the rest of us re­ally hope that that will hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>He added that even be­fore the trade war, many Chi­nese com­pa­nies were di­ver­si­fy­ing out of China be­cause of higher cost.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese econ­omy is mov­ing higher in the value chain, which gives rise to the need for labour-in­ten­sive pro­duc­tion to re­lo­cate to more lo­ca­tions out­side China, Mr Thar­man said.</p>
    <p>“This is a real op­por­tu­nity for us in South-east Asia and the rest of Asia.”</p>
    <p>He said Asean is both a grow­ing source of de­mand in its own right – an in­creas­ingly im­por­tant mar­ket of more than 600 mil­lion peo­ple – and also an in­creas­ingly com­pet­i­tive pro­duc­tion lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Asean is very well fit­ted out to com­ple­ment China as we both evolve in our eco­nomic devel­op­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Many observers have high­lighted the like­li­hood of global sup­ply chains in many sec­tors be­com­ing shorter and less just in time, lead­ing to a more frag­mented global trade sys­tem with a greater range of sup­pli­ers for sim­i­lar prod­ucts and the re­lo­ca­tion of some pro­duc­tion closer to home.</p>
    <p>Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice, in a re­port on Monday, said the pan­demic and US-China trade war will ac­cel­er­ate ac­tiv­i­ties be­ing moved to Asean, along­side China’s climb up the value-added chain.</p>
    <p>Trade flows between the rest of Asia and ad­vanced economies will likely grow at the ex­pense of trade between ad­vanced economies and China.</p>
    <p>There will be an ex­o­dus of for­eign com­pa­nies from the Chi­nese mar­ket even as com­pa­nies step up ef­forts to mit­i­gate risks, the re­port noted.</p>
    <p>Fun­da­men­tally, we have now the op­por­tu­nity of build­ing a more re­silient and more in­te­grated Asian sup­ply chain, in other words, an Asian pro­duc­tion re­gion, as well as Asian mar­kets that are open to the world and be­come an ex­am­ple of how through open­ness, in­te­gra­tion, and risk man­age­ment of sup­ply chains, we can re­ally have a win-win, first for those of us within Asia, within Asean, and also for the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>WIN-WIN FOR ALL</p>
