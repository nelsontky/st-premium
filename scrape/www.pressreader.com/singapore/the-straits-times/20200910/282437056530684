    <p>Eng­land man­ager Gareth South­gate said Na­tions League matches should not have gone ahead dur­ing pre-sea­son for most ma­jor Euro­pean leagues af­ter a 0-0 draw in Den­mark on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Three Lions were hit by in­juries and off-field prob­lems af­ter Phil Fo­den and Ma­son Green­wood were sent home for breach­ing coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols fol­low­ing Satur­day’s 1-0 vic­tory in Ice­land. The pair in­vited girls to the team ho­tel in Reyk­javik and South­gate said the duo would need to earn back his trust be­fore he would se­lect them again.</p>
    <p>South­gate, al­ready with­out cen­tre-back Harry Maguire who was in­volved in a fra­cas on hol­i­day in Greece, ex­per­i­mented with a 3-4-3 for­ma­tion. With three at the back and two de­fen­sive piv­ots, Eng­land strug­gled to get the best out of at­tack­ers Harry Kane, Ra­heem Ster­ling and Jadon San­cho while Leeds mid­fielder Kalvin Phillips had an un­event­ful Eng­land de­but.</p>
    <p>Eng­land i mproved af­ter the break af­ter Ma­son Mount, then Jack</p>
    <p>Gre­al­ish, were in­tro­duced to bal­ance the mid­field, but clear chances were few and far be­tween.</p>
    <p>Kane al­most notched a stop­page­time win­ner af­ter round­ing Kasper Sch­me­ichel, only for Mathias Jor­gensen to make a goal-line clear­ance.</p>
    <p>For­mer Eng­land for­ward Chris Wad­dle hit out at South­gate’s strait­jacket ap­proach.</p>
    <p>“These were two good games to have a look at Jack Gre­al­ish,” he told BBC 5 Live. “You can’t give him 15 min­utes and say ‘see what hap­pens’</p>
    <p>– he might never get an­other game.”</p>
    <p>For­mer de­fender South­gate de­fended his se­lec­tion, say­ing it was an op­por­tu­nity to look at a dif­fer­ent sys­tem, with an em­pha­sis to con­trol the game. He also pointed to a lack of match fit­ness – with the Premier League not start­ing un­til this week­end – as the rea­son for such a sharp con­trast be­tween Eng­land’s per­for­mances over the past week and their free-scor­ing form in qual­i­fy­ing for Euro 2020 be­fore the coro­n­avirusen­forced shut­down.</p>
    <p>“The phys­i­cal con­di­tion­ing of the play­ers was a huge fac­tor,” he said. “We shouldn’t have been play­ing. It doesn’t work for the clubs and it doesn’t work for in­ter­na­tional foot­ball.”</p>
