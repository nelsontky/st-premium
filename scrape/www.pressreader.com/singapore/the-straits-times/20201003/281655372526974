    <p>IN QUAR­AN­TINE</p>
    <p>Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. We will be­gin our quar­an­tine and re­cov­ery process im­me­di­ately. We will get through this TO­GETHER! ’’</p>
    <p>PRES­I­DENT DON­ALD TRUMP on him­self and First Lady Me­la­nia Trump, on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>News that United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and First Lady Me­la­nia Trump have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 has made what was an al­ready sur­real con­test even more un­pre­dictable.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians, pun­dits and con­sti­tu­tional lawyers are scram­bling to find an an­swer to the ques­tion: What hap­pens if a pres­i­den­tial can­di­date is in­ca­pac­i­tated, or worse, dies, be­fore the elec­tion?</p>
    <p>The short an­swer is that a messy elec­tion could get even more chaotic.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause while the con­test is of­fi­cially sup­posed to be held on Nov 3, vot­ing is al­ready un­der way, and re­plac­ing a can­di­date with the clock run­ning down could be a le­gal and lo­gis­ti­cal night­mare.</p>
    <p>There have been con­cerns for both Mr Trump, 74, and his pres­i­den­tial ri­val Joe Bi­den, 77, due to their age.</p>
    <p>Less than 48 hours be­fore his di­ag­no­sis, the Pres­i­dent shared a stage with Mr Bi­den at the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate in Cleve­land, Ohio – though they did not shake hands.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is sup­pos­edly in very good health, but his party must pre­pare for the even­tu­al­ity that it may have to field an­other can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Dr Richard H. Pildes, pro­fes­sor of con­sti­tu­tional law at New York Univer­sity, was asked about this very sce­nario in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>He said that the ball would be in the hands of the can­di­date’s po­lit­i­cal party.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, who would be­come pres­i­dent in the event of Mr Trump’s death, would be a top choice for the Repub­li­can Party – but not the cer­tain pick.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee has 168 mem­bers – three from each state plus three from six ter­ri­to­ries. A vote will have to be held. The par­ties would then have to re­place the name of their de­ceased can­di­date with that of the new can­di­date.</p>
    <p>“De­pend­ing on when this hap­pens, that might not be sim­ple,” Dr Pildes said.</p>
    <p>“Dif­fer­ent states have dif­fer­ent dead­lines for when the par­ties must cer­tify their can­di­dates for the bal­lot.”</p>
    <p>Also, if states do not have laws that per­mit chang­ing the can­di­date’s name, any change may be chal­lenged in court – although courts would be un­likely to refuse the new nom­i­na­tion if the party process has been fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>But the wran­gling could de­lay the process.</p>
    <p>Separately, pro­fes­sor of law and po­lit­i­cal sci­ence Rick Hasen at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Irvine writes: “The prob­lem here is that bal­lots are al­ready out and mil­lions of peo­ple have al­ready voted. At this point, it seems im­pos­si­ble for can­di­dates to come up with a new name to re­place a name on the bal­lot with­out start­ing the whole elec­tion process over, which is not pos­si­ble in the 30-plus days be­fore elec­tion day. Congress could pass a Bill de­lay­ing the elec­tion, but I find it hard to be­lieve it would do so.”</p>
    <p>The other ques­tion, if Pres­i­dent Trump gets re­placed by an­other can­di­date, is what hap­pens to the votes that have al­ready been cast in his favour?</p>
    <p>In the case of some states, and Amer­i­cans overseas, where early vot­ing is al­ready tak­ing place by mail, it is up to in­di­vid­ual states to re­view their laws and de­cide whether, if the can­di­date dies in the in­terim, the bal­lots would au­to­mat­i­cally count to­wards the new can­di­date from his party, or be can­celled. The verdict on that may well have to be de­cided in the courts.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the Amer­i­can elec­tion is re­ally 50 elec­tions plus one (in the District of Columbia), with each state hav­ing its own rules and reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>One thing is al­most cer­tain: With the Pres­i­dent and the First Lady in quar­an­tine, the sec­ond pres­i­den­tial de­bate due for Oct 15 will be can­celled.</p>
    <p>For­eign pol­icy de­ci­sions that have been largely the turf of the White House dur­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion may also be placed on hold.</p>
    <p>And if the Pres­i­dent does suc­cumb to the virus – re­gard­less of the process for a sub­sti­tute can­di­date – there is a risk of real tur­moil in a deeply di­vided coun­try with an econ­omy and a peo­ple stag­ger­ing un­der a colos­sal coro­n­avirus death toll of over 200,000.</p>
    <p>RE­COV­ER­ING AT HOME</p>
    <p>As too many Amer­i­cans have done this year, @potus & I are quar­an­tin­ing at home af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19. We are feel­ing good & I have post­poned all up­com­ing en­gage­ments. Please be sure you are stay­ing safe & we will all get through ’’ this to­gether.</p>
