    <p>The philoso­pher Alain Ba­diou de­scribes love as ar­riv­ing in the “ab­so­lute con­tin­gency of the en­counter with some­one I didn’t know”, and lead­ing to a mo­ment when the “dec­la­ra­tion of love marks the tran­si­tion from chance to destiny”.</p>
    <p>Rumi cel­e­brates life in his de­scrip­tion of the lover wait­ing for the beloved. “Come to the orchard in Spring,” he says. “There is light and wine, and sweet­hearts/in the pome­gran­ate flow­ers.” Then?</p>
    <p>“If you do not come, these do not mat­ter./If you do come, these do not mat­ter.”</p>
    <p>The beloved is all: With­out her, even the plen­i­tude of ex­is­tence wastes the lover’s life. Chance, in the il­lu­sory forms of light, wine, flow­ers and other hu­mans, falls short of destiny, which ar­rives only with the foot­falls of the beloved.</p>
    <p>That is love. How about time, with­out which no tran­si­tion is pos­si­ble?</p>
    <p>Shake­speare sets the bar very high. “Love is not love/Which al­ters when it al­ter­ation finds”, a son­net of his de­clares. “Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks/Within his bend­ing sickle’s com­pass come.”</p>
    <p>When the sickle de­vours youth and life as well, what re­mains is Pe­trarch’s lament for Laura: “Noth­ing down here both pleases and en­dures.” Death is cruel not only be­cause it takes the beloved but also be­cause it con­spires with life to keep the lover alive in his tor­ment.</p>
    <p>Those sen­ti­ments are supremely cap­ti­vat­ing, but they be­long to po­ets who largely en­joyed the priv­i­lege of nor­malcy (al­though Laura was a vic­tim of a plague).</p>
    <p>True, time tested the re­la­tion­ship be­tween life and love even then. Two hu­mans came to­gether, sought a sin­gle life, found it, and, if they did not, sep­a­rated in un­re­quited long­ing, vex­a­tious part­ing, in­tel­lec­tual for­give­ness or ev­er­last­ing re­gret. Death waited out­side the doors of pri­vate re­la­tion­ships like a voyeur.</p>
    <p>How­ever, what hap­pens in ab­nor­mal ages when death be­comes a pub­lic re­la­tion­ship? What hap­pens when pri­vate doors open and love lies on the deathbed?</p>
    <p>What hap­pens when a pan­demic in­ter­venes be­tween per­sonal ar­rivals and de­par­tures to re­con­fig­ure the pa­ram­e­ters of life as a hu­man jour­ney? What would hap­pen if the very sphere of Eros were to be at­tacked by dis­ease? How might one fall and live in love then, dis­eased?</p>
    <p>In his novel, Love In The Time Of</p>
    <p>Cholera, Gabriel Gar­cia Mar­quez pro­claims that love is a “state of grace: not the means to any­thing but the al­pha and omega, an end in it­self ”.</p>
    <p>Those words would have been a plat­i­tude had they come from a lesser writer speak­ing of a hap­pier age. It is cholera that trans­forms the prox­im­ity of death into the eter­nal im­me­di­acy of love. If cholera is chance in ex­tremis, love is destiny as the grand fi­nale of life.</p>
    <p>The tri­umph of the novel lies in a plot which is as much about cholera as it is about love. The dis­ease weaves it­self as a fa­tal mo­tif through the deliri­ously ex­pe­ri­enced lives of its char­ac­ters. Cholera can kill the body, but it can­not erase the ir­re­duc­ible con­tin­gency and fi­nal ec­stasy of the en­counter called love.</p>
    <p>Even an epi­demic is pow­er­less be­fore the in­fec­tious legacy of the old­est search for com­pany. Love in the time of cholera is no more than cholera in the time of love.</p>
    <p>Why should any­thing change be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic?</p>
    <p>Yes, it is de­stroy­ing the known earth, but war, famine and dis­ease have done that al­ways in their pass­ing ways. What is so dif­fer­ent now?</p>
    <p>Per­haps there is no way of judg­ing the dif­fer­ence. There is no way of know­ing how many peo­ple have fallen in love, and how many have fallen out of it, since the ar­rival of the pan­demic this year. How many have avoided love al­to­gether as an in­fir­mity of the mind con­firmed by the ma­te­rial dis­re­pair of stricken times? The erotic state of world af­fairs re­mains un­known.</p>
    <p>Only when a lit­er­ary mas­ter­piece is writ­ten on love in the time of the coro­n­avirus will we know.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, hu­mans could do no worse than re­mem­ber how far love has come in its fight with time.</p>
    <p>It is said that there was never a day when Socrates was not in love. He had an al­most sex­ual ap­petite for ideas. He way­laid, courted and kid­napped them in or­der to steal them into the lives of his fel­low Greeks so that phi­los­o­phy could trans­form their chanced days into a brazen sense of destiny.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ideas and their reign­ing de­ity, knowl­edge, are in­suf­fi­cient guides. Thomas Mann’s Death In Venice, a novella set against a plague, in­vokes So­cratic ideas of the philo­soph­i­cal good, but with the twist that “beauty alone is both divine and vis­i­ble”.</p>
    <p>No one can en­ter the world of ideas with­out walk­ing through the de­bris of re­al­ity in which liv­ing ideas lie half-buried.</p>
    <p>It is beauty which emerges, flower-like, be­tween the bro­ken stones of for­got­ten way­sides. Hu­mans need to re­trace their steps oc­ca­sion­ally if they are to re­cover the fer­tile beauty of the world that cre­ated their ca­pac­ity for imag­i­na­tion, sex­u­al­ity and thought, fac­ul­ties with­out which life would re­main un­ex­am­ined and thus not worth liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Beauty is the supreme cat­a­lyst of the tran­si­tion from chance to destiny. That chem­istry is at work in Sin­ga­pore ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Even in the midst of this epic suf­fer­ing, with so many peo­ple los­ing jobs and dreams, the beau­ti­ful ci­ti­zens of this fresh-faced Repub­lic still look at one an­other ad­mir­ingly as they take the bus or the train to uni­ver­si­ties or fac­to­ries, to hos­pi­tals and places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>If the coro­n­avirus is air­borne, so is beauty.</p>
    <p>Destiny will ar­rive, with chance ly­ing like dust on feet scarred beau­ti­fully by love.</p>
