    <p>Record of both Manch­ester United and Manch­ester City from their last six games.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer be­lieves win­ning the League Cup would be a “big step” in Manch­ester United’s devel­op­ment as he pre­pares for to­day’s semi-fi­nal show­down with Manch­ester City at Old Traf­ford.</p>
    <p>United went out to Pep Guardi­ola’s men in the fi­nal four of the com­pe­ti­tion last sea­son, be­fore also los­ing in the semi-fi­nals of the FA Cup and Europa League.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils fin­ished third in the Pre­mier League be­hind City and Liver­pool to show for Sol­sk­jaer’s first full sea­son in charge. United have pushed on this sea­son in the league to find them­selves level on 33 points with Liver­pool at the top of the ta­ble, with a game in hand on the cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>With United yet to win sil­ver­ware since 2017, Sol­sk­jaer be­lieves ad­vanc­ing to the League Cup fi­nal and win­ning at Wem­b­ley on April 25 would gal­vanise his team.</p>
    <p>“A semi-fi­nal is a chance to get to the fi­nal, to get your hands on a tro­phy in the next round and for this team it would be a very, very big step get­ting your hands on a tro­phy,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ve de­vel­oped a lot in the last six months, last 12 months since the last semi in the Carabao (League) Cup so of course, it’s not just learn­ing to win semis. We’ve also earned the right to feel we can go all the way with our per­for­mances. We are con­fi­dent, we are go­ing into the game with good form so there are no ex­cuses.”</p>
    <p>The Manch­ester ri­vals are the two most in-form teams at the mo­ment and Kevin de Bruyne feels</p>
    <p>City are start­ing to click af­ter a slow start.</p>
    <p>“We still have an­other eight games in Jan­uary in all com­pe­ti­tions, it’s go­ing to be tough, but I think we are ready for the bat­tle (against United) and that is what mat­ters,” said the mid­fielder.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola and Sol­sk­jaer will to­day be al­lowed to make five sub­sti­tu­tions in­stead of three. The English Foot­ball League (EFL) an­nounced the change – which also ap­plies to the fi­nal – on Mon­day as they look to ease the bur­den of fix­ture con­ges­tion caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Pre­mier League voted against al­low­ing teams to make five sub­sti­tu­tions per match this term but the EFL said it had con­sulted the League Cup semi-fi­nal­ists. The clubs can also name nine sub­sti­tutes on the bench.</p>
    <p>The league said yes­ter­day that 40 in­di­vid­u­als tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the high­est num­ber of cases in a week this sea­son, in two rounds of tests con­ducted last week. Since the new sea­son kicked off, 171 in­di­vid­u­als in the top flight have tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus in 19 rounds of test­ing.</p>
