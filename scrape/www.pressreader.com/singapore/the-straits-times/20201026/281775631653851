    <p>BEI­JING • China de­tected 137 new asymp­to­matic coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day in Kash­gar, in the north­west­ern re­gion of Xin­jiang, af­ter one per­son was found to have the virus the pre­vi­ous day – the first lo­cal new cases for 10 days in main­land China.</p>
    <p>All 137 new cases were linked to a gar­ment fac­tory. The par­ents of a 17-year-old girl who was found last Satur­day to have the virus but showed no symp­toms worked there, an of­fi­cial from the Xin­jiang health com­mis­sion told a press brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The new cases marked main­land China’s first lo­cal in­fec­tions since Oct 14, when one was de­tected in Qing­dao. Xin­jiang was the site of a lo­cal clus­ter in Au­gust, but no new cases had been found in the re­gion since Aug 15.</p>
    <p>Kash­gar launched a test­ing pro­gramme last Satur­day night cov­er­ing the re­gion’s 4.75 mil­lion peo­ple. As at yes­ter­day after­noon, more than 2.84 mil­lion peo­ple had been tested and the rest will be cov­ered by to­mor­row, the city gov­ern­ment said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The Kash­gar gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day said all schools ex­cept uni­ver­si­ties will be closed un­til Fri­day, but su­per­mar­kets and shop­ping malls will re­main open.</p>
    <p>Four towns in the Kash­gar re­gion were iden­ti­fied as “high-risk” areas, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from the Kash­gar city au­thor­ity yes­ter­day night, and strin­gent con­trols such as travel re­stric­tions are ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Vic­to­ria state, Aus­tralia’s Covid-19 epi­cen­tre, yes­ter­day de­layed an ex­pected an­nounce­ment on the eas­ing of lock­down re­stric­tions due to an out­break in Mel­bourne, prompt­ing warn­ings that res­i­dents were at a “fi­nan­cial and men­tal break­ing point”.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions have lim­ited most re­tail busi­nesses in the state’s cap­i­tal to pro­vid­ing only on­line ser­vices since early Au­gust, and five mil­lion peo­ple liv­ing un­der stay-ath­ome or­ders were ex­pect­ing an an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>State Premier Daniel Andrews told a me­dia con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that the out­break in Mel­bourne’s north­ern sub­urbs threat­ened to push the re­open­ing date of re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity busi­nesses closer to Nov 1.</p>
    <p>Mr Andrews said he de­cided to wait un­til test re­sults showed whether or not all in­fec­tions in the lat­est out­break were linked.</p>
    <p>“We will get (the test re­sults) to­day and to­mor­row and hope­fully we are able to (not only make) an­nounce­ments but also take the big steps safely around the mid­dle of this week,” he said. “I know ev­ery­one will be dis­ap­pointed we’re not mak­ing that move to­day. I am too.”</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment and in­dus­try lead­ers have been putting in­creas­ing pres­sure on Mr Andrews to fully re­open the city and the rest of the state. The 14-day mov­ing av­er­age of new cases in Vic­to­ria fell to 4.6, be­low the thresh­old of five which Mr Andrews had pre­vi­ously set for the next band of re­stric­tions to be lifted.</p>
