    <p>Thir­teen men have been ar­rested for plot­ting to abduct the Demo­cratic gov­er­nor of the US state of Michi­gan and to “in­sti­gate a civil war”. The plots hatched by the men, some of them mem­bers of right-wing mili­tia, in­cluded storm­ing the state capi­tol, bomb­ing a bridge and kid­nap­ping Gov­er­nor Gretchen Whit­mer be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON • Thir­teen men, in­clud­ing mem­bers of two rightwing mili­tias, have been ar­rested for two re­lated plots to kid­nap the Demo­cratic gov­er­nor of the US state of Michi­gan and to “in­sti­gate a civil war”.</p>
    <p>The plots they hatched in­cluded storm­ing the state capi­tol, bomb­ing a bridge to di­vert po­lice at­ten­tion, and ab­duct­ing Gov­er­nor Gretchen Whit­mer be­fore the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, United States of­fi­cials said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Birge, US at­tor­ney for the western district of Michi­gan, said six men face fed­eral charges for con­spir­ing to kid­nap the gov­er­nor from her va­ca­tion home. He said they had con­ducted sur­veil­lance of her res­i­dence and tested a home-made bomb meant to be used to di­vert law en­force­ment away from her home.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) agents and Michi­gan po­lice ar­rested the sus­pects on Wed­nes­day as they met to “pool funds for ex­plo­sives and ex­change tac­ti­cal gear”, the Justice De­part­ment said.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­peat­edly at­tacked Gov­er­nor Whit­mer, 49, over her tough coro­n­avirus lock­down, and armed rightwing groups have staged protests against her in the state cap­i­tal Lansing.</p>
    <p>“LIB­ER­ATE MICHI­GAN!” Mr Trump tweeted in April.</p>
    <p>Late on Thurs­day, the Pres­i­dent showed lit­tle sym­pa­thy when he com­mented via Twit­ter. “Rather than say thank you” for the FBI ac­tion, Mr Trump said, “she calls me a White Su­prem­a­cist”.</p>
    <p>With­out ex­plic­itly con­demn­ing the plot­ters, Mr Trump said: “I do not tol­er­ate ANY ex­treme vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing ALL Amer­i­cans, even those who op­pose and at­tack me, is what I will al­ways do as your Pres­i­dent!”</p>
    <p>Ms Whit­mer said that when she took the oath of of­fice, “I knew this job would be hard”, but “never could have imag­ined any­thing like this”.</p>
    <p>She added: “We are not one an­other’s en­emy. This virus is our en­emy.”</p>
    <p>She pointed to Mr Trump’s re­fusal at the re­cent de­bate with Demo­crat Joe Bi­den to con­demn white su­prem­a­cists and “hate groups” like the two Michi­gan mili­tias al­legedly in­volved in the plots. “Stand back and stand by, he told them,” she said. “Hate groups heard the Pres­i­dent’s words not as a re­buke but as a ral­ly­ing cry, as a call to ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>The group of six that planned the kid­nap­ping met re­peat­edly over the sum­mer for firearms train­ing and com­bat drills and prac­tised build­ing ex­plo­sives, the FBI said. Mem­bers also gath­ered sev­eral times to dis­cuss the mis­sion, in­clud­ing in the base­ment of a shop that was ac­ces­si­ble only through a “trap door” un­der a rug.</p>
    <p>The men spied on Ms Whit­mer’s va­ca­tion home in Au­gust and last month, even look­ing un­der a high­way bridge for places they could place and det­o­nate a bomb to dis­tract the au­thor­i­ties, the FBI said.</p>
    <p>They in­di­cated that they wanted to take Gov­er­nor Whit­mer hostage be­fore the elec­tion next month, and one man said they should take her to a “se­cure lo­ca­tion” in Wis­con­sin for a “trial”, Mr Richard Trask II, an FBI spe­cial agent, said in the crim­i­nal com­plaint.</p>
    <p>Mr Trask said that one of those ar­rested had bought a Taser for the mis­sion last week and that the men had been plan­ning to buy ex­plo­sives on Wed­nes­day. Court records in­di­cated that at least five of the men had been ar­rested on Wed­nes­day in Yp­si­lanti, Michi­gan.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Michi­gan’s At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Dana Nes­sel said that seven mem­bers of a mili­tia group called the Wolver­ine Watch­men were fac­ing state charges over the other plot.</p>
    <p>They are sus­pected of at­tempt­ing to iden­tify the home ad­dresses of law en­force­ment of­fi­cers in or­der to tar­get them and “in­sti­gate a civil war”, she said.</p>
    <p>The seven were charged with var­i­ous of­fences in­clud­ing pro­vid­ing ma­te­rial sup­port for ter­ror­ist acts, gang mem­ber­ship and firearms vi­o­la­tions.</p>
