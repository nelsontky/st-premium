    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Try to take greater care with your tem­per – it is far too easy for you to shake peo­ple up when you think you are just vent­ing.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing a sense of own­er­ship over some­thing that might not re­ally be yours, so try to let go as much as you can.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>The day is all about watch­ing and wait­ing and tak­ing notes. You may feel im­pa­tient with the pace of the day’s events.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You need to deal with some se­ri­ous emo­tional busi­ness and it might be made even more dif­fi­cult by some­one’s chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Spend ex­tra time on a col­lec­tion of some kind – maybe sig­na­tures for a cam­paign or an­tique porce­lain dolls.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You should do what­ever it takes to get at the hid­den vari­ables. You are at your best when you are fill­ing in gaps and an­swer­ing big ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are not thought­less – you are just think­ing about your own needs. Let oth­ers think what they will be­cause you need to take care of your­self first.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are get­ting ev­ery bit of re­spect you de­serve. Your great en­ergy helps you to push for even greater ad­van­tage as you make your way through the day.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You may feel the need for some alone time. You prob­a­bly de­serve it and it is likely that you need the men­tal space to keep ev­ery­thing straight in your head.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You have peo­ple on your side. Reach out for help and you are sure to be sur­prised by the speed and strength of the re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You need some time to your­self. Things are great, but ev­ery now and then, you need the men­tal space to process ev­ery­thing that has been go­ing on.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You are find­ing it eas­ier to get things done – so much so that you may close an im­por­tant deal long be­fore you thought you would.</p>
