    <p>•</p>
    <p>Alexan­der Zverev lost in the fourth round of the French Open on Sun­day, but it be­came clear af­ter the match that he likely should not have com­peted at all.</p>
    <p>“I’m com­pletely sick,” the 23-year-old said fol­low­ing his fourset loss to Jan­nik Sin­ner. “I can’t re­ally breathe, as you can hear by my voice. I had fever as well. Yeah, I’m not in the best phys­i­cal state, I would say.”</p>
    <p>French Open of­fi­cials said that he had not shared the de­tails of his symp­toms with tour­na­ment doc­tors as he ar­rived to play, as re­quired by the event’s coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols. It is not clear whether the Ger­man has con­tracted the virus – he has tested neg­a­tive re­peat­edly, al­though his most re­cent test had been five days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>But the episode raised ques­tions about the pre­cau­tions taken by the French Tennis Fed­er­a­tion (FFT) for a mar­quee event in a coun­try that has seen an uptick in coro­n­avirus cases and re­cently im­posed tighter lim­its on large gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>“Zverev is up to date on his tests, which have all been neg­a­tive,” the FFT said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Zverev’s last test was Tues­day, with the neg­a­tive re­sult re­turned on Wed­nes­day, the fed­er­a­tion said.</p>
    <p>“To­day he re­ceived a re­minder for his next test, to be car­ried out within five days of the pre­vi­ous re­sults. He did not con­sult the tour­na­ment doc­tors be­fore his match.”</p>
    <p>Zverev said he be­gan feel­ing sick on Fri­day night af­ter his thir­dround win over qual­i­fier Marco Cecchi­nato. He said his body tem­per­a­ture reached 38 deg C.</p>
    <p>The world No. 7 con­sulted tour­na­ment med­i­cal of­fi­cials dur­ing the first set of the match, and they gave him a nasal spray that he used.</p>
    <p>Al­though he com­peted well, he re­gret­ted tak­ing to the court. “To be hon­est, I warmed up to­day – I shouldn’t have played,” he said.</p>
    <p>No pos­i­tive tests have been dis­closed since the main draw be­gan on Sept 27. Two play­ers in the ju­nior girls’ tour­na­ment had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 and had been re­moved from the draw.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, ap­prox­i­mately 3,000 tests have been car­ried out since Sept 17, or­gan­is­ers said.</p>
    <p>Zverev stressed that he had re­peat­edly tested neg­a­tive. He is hope­ful that he does not have the virus and pointed out that he had not shown some of its symp­toms.</p>
    <p>It is not clear whether he will be tested again fol­low­ing his loss.</p>
    <p>Tour­na­ment pro­to­cols man­date that play­ers “be tested again ev­ery five days un­til they are knocked out of the tour­na­ment”.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment’s health and safety guide­lines state that its health pro­to­cols were based on “call­ing on a sense of civic duty and re­spon­si­bil­ity on the part of all at­tend­ing the event in any ca­pac­ity”.</p>
    <p>Per­haps with that sense of trust, the French Open has not taken daily manda­tory tem­per­a­ture read­ings for play­ers en­ter­ing the grounds, as the US Open did. Its ap­proach is also less re­stric­tive in terms of ac­cess to the main player ho­tel, which is open to out­side guests.</p>
    <p>Play­ers still in the draw must re­main at the ho­tel when not com­pet­ing or risk be­ing dis­qual­i­fied, but play­ers who have been elim­i­nated are per­mit­ted to come and go while re­main­ing guests.</p>
    <p>At the US Open, elim­i­nated play­ers and their team mem­bers had to re­main in the of­fi­cial ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Zverev said af­ter his sec­on­dround win that the ho­tel was “not re­ally a bub­ble” and com­pared the safety mea­sures un­favourably to the US Open in New York.</p>
    <p>Play­ers and coaches also have com­plained that they have some­times not re­ceived their re­sults in Paris af­ter coro­n­avirus tests.</p>
