    <p>WASHINGTON • United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump yesterday said Hong Kong’s global fi­nan­cial cen­tre will “go to hell” un­der tight­ened Chi­nese rule.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong can never suc­ceed hav­ing China as op­posed to the thou­sands of ge­niuses that ran it, hav­ing China run it,” he told Fox Busi­ness news. “The Hong Kong mar­kets will go to hell. No­body’s go­ing to do busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump an­nounced in May that he was end­ing the spe­cial US trad­ing re­la­tion­ship with Hong Kong in re­tal­i­a­tion for Bei­jing’s clam­p­down on the pre­vi­ously largely au­tonomous city.</p>
    <p>He told Fox Busi­ness yesterday that the end to the spe­cial sta­tus meant Hong Kong would lose its abil­ity to at­tract busi­ness and serve as one of the world’s chief fi­nan­cial hubs, along with New York and London.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said he had ap­proved of the long­stand­ing re­la­tion­ship, which amounted to a “tremen­dous amount of money in the form of in­cen­tives to make Hong Kong free”. But “once China got ag­gres­sive and took it over, I took every­thing back”, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has made a trade war with China, fol­lowed by a truce at the start of this year, a pil­lar of his for­eign pol­icy. But hopes for a fol­low-up phase two trade deal have been dashed by ten­sions over the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has seen his re-elec­tion chances se­ri­ously hurt by the fall­out from the pan­demic and is in­creas­ingly fo­cus­ing blame on China, where the virus first ap­peared.</p>
    <p>“My mind­set has changed on China since they al­lowed the plague,” he said. “It’s be­fore plague and after plague. Right now I view China dif­fer­ently than I did be­fore plague.”</p>
