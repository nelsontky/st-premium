    <p>• Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard has con­firmed new sign­ing Edouard Mendy is the club’s first-choice goal­keeper ahead of Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga – for the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>The Sene­gal No. 1, who missed last week­end’s 3-3 draw with Southamp­ton i n the Premier League, made an ear­lier than ex­pected re­turn from in­jury and was re­stored to the start­ing line-up for their Group E Cham­pi­ons League opener against Sevilla.</p>
    <p>He showed why he de­served to keep his place in the team as both sides bat­tled to a goal-less draw at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>While the 28-year-old had only one ma­jor save to make in a cagey en­counter that will be re­mem­bered for de­fen­sive dogged­ness than at­tack­ing play, he was an as­sured fig­ure be­tween the sticks, un­like the er­ror-prone Kepa.</p>
    <p>Asked if Mendy was now his pre­ferred pick, Lam­pard said: “The way he has played in the three games since be­ing here, he’s played very well... So at the minute, yes.</p>
    <p>“I said when he came in it was good for com­pe­ti­tion. We knew his qual­i­ties and he’s show­ing them al­ready. The way he is play­ing I’m very happy.</p>
    <p>“To­day the bonus is the clean sheet. It’s a long sea­son and we are in the early stages of it.”</p>
    <p>The in­clu­sion of Petr Cech as fourth goal­keeper in Chelsea’s Premier League squad has raised some eye­brows, given the Czech re­tired last year, but Lam­pard said he would act as cover.</p>
    <p>The man­ager con­firmed that the 38-year-old, who played for Chelsea from 2004-2015 and a fur­ther four sea­sons for Arse­nal, would be called into ac­tion only in the event of an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>“We had that space in the squad and we know this year, it looks like no other be­cause of Covid and iso­la­tion... We felt it was a no­brainer to have Pete in the squad,” Lam­pard said of the Blues’ tech­ni­cal and per­for­mance ad­viser.</p>
    <p>“He’s still rel­a­tively young. He fin­ished play­ing when he pos­si­bly could have car­ried on.”</p>
    <p>Else­where in the group, debu­tants Rennes and Krasnodar set­tled for a 1-1 draw in France. The French Ligue 1 team travel to Sevilla, while Rus­sia’s Krasnodar host Chelsea next week.</p>
