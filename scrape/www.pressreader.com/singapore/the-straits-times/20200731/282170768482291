    <p>Kep­pel Corp has posted a net loss of $697.6 mil­lion for the sec­ond quar­ter ended June, re­vers­ing a $153.1 mil­lion net profit a year ago. The com­pany was hit by $919 mil­lion in pro­vi­sions for Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine’s contract as­sets, doubt­ful debt, as well as share of im­pair­ment pro­vi­sion aris­ing from its as­so­ciate, Floa­tel.</p>
    <p>With­out the im­pair­ments, Kep­pel would have had a net profit of $222 mil­lion for the quar­ter, up 45 per cent from a year ago. The com­pany’s quar­terly rev­enue stood at $1.33 bil­lion, down 25.7 per cent from a year ago. Con­tri­bu­tions fell across all busi­ness di­vi­sions due to mea­sures to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel yes­ter­day de­clared an in­terim div­i­dend of 3 cents per share, down from the 8 cents it had de­clared for the same pe­riod a year ago. This will paid on Aug 20.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Loh Chin Hua said that Kep­pel has failed to meet a pre-con­di­tion to a $4 bil­lion takeover of­fer from Te­masek Hold­ings. “We be­lieve that the 20 per cent thresh­old in the MAC (ma­te­rial ad­verse change) clause in re­spect of net profit after tax has been crossed, which means that the MAC pre-con­di­tion in Te­masek’s pre-con­di­tional par­tial of­fer has not been sat­is­fied.”</p>
    <p>MAC clauses can be in­voked to end or rene­go­ti­ate deals, par­tic­u­larly if events oc­cur that are detri­men­tal to the tar­get com­pany.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, Te­masek, which al­ready owns about one-fifth of Kep­pel, of­fered to buy an ad­di­tional 30.6 per cent stake.</p>
    <p>Still, the deal has a long-stop date of Oct 21, mean­ing Kep­pel could make up any short­fall in its thirdquar­ter re­sults, while Te­masek also has the right to waive its pre-con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>For the first half of its fi­nan­cial year, Kep­pel’s net loss amounted to $537 mil­lion, with the com­pany hit by $930 mil­lion of im­pair­ments from the off­shore & marine di­vi­sion. Ex­clud­ing the im­pair­ments, it would have reg­is­tered a net profit of $393 mil­lion for the first six months of the year, 5 per cent higher than a year ago.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue stood at $3.18 bil­lion, down 4 per cent from a year ago. This was due mainly to lower con­tri­bu­tions from prop­erty trad­ing projects in China, power and gas sales, en­vi­ron­men­tal en­gi­neer­ing projects and as­set man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The off­shore & marine di­vi­sion re­ported a net loss of $959 mil­lion, re­vers­ing the net profit of $10 mil­lion a year ago. Be­sides the im­pair­ments, Kep­pel’s O&M Sin­ga­pore work­force was re­duced to about 1,200 per­sons for most of the sec­ond quar­ter, from about 24,000 in March. The work­force has since risen to about 5,000. As at endJune, the net or­der­book stood at $3.5 bil­lion, which is ex­pected to last the off­shore & marine di­vi­sion for at least two years.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh said that most of the com­pany’s busi­nesses have re­mained re­silient, un­der­pinned by the es­sen­tial ser­vices that they pro­vide.</p>
