    <p>LON­DON • Meghan Markle (right), the Duchess of Sus­sex, won a court bat­tle on Wed­nes­day to keep the names of five of her friends pri­vate for the time be­ing, as part of her le­gal ac­tion against a Bri­tish tabloid which she ac­cuses of in­vad­ing her pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>Meghan, the wife of Queen El­iz­a­beth’s grand­son Prince Harry, is su­ing As­so­ci­ated News­pa­pers over ar­ti­cles in The Mail on Sun­day that in­cluded parts of a hand­writ­ten let­ter she had sent to her es­tranged fa­ther, Mr Thomas Markle, in Au­gust 2018.</p>
    <p>As part of its de­fence, the pa­per ar­gues that it pub­lished the let­ter in Fe­bru­ary last year af­ter five of Meghan’s friends gave anony­mous in­ter­views to Amer­i­can mag­a­zine Peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The duchess ar­gues that she did not au­tho­rise her friends to speak to Peo­ple and that The Mail on Sun­day only wanted to name them to ex­ploit the le­gal dis­pute for com­mer­cial rea­sons.</p>
    <p>She says nam­ing them would pose a threat to their “emo­tional and men­tal well-be­ing”.</p>
    <p>Judge Mark Warby ruled at Lon­don’s High Court that their names could not be pub­lished for the mo­ment, but that this could change.</p>
    <p>“I have con­cluded that for the time be­ing, at least the Court should grant the claimant the or­ders she seeks, the ef­fect of which will be to con­fer pro­tec­tion on the sources’ iden­ti­ties,” he said.</p>
    <p>The anonymity is­sue is one of a num­ber of pre­lim­i­nary mat­ters, with the full trial not ex­pected un­til next year.</p>
    <p>Judge Warby said the case had al­ready taken 10 months and was still “some way from trial”, say­ing it needed to move for­ward at a greater pace.</p>
    <p>“The duchess felt it was nec­es­sary to take this step to try and pro­tect her friends – as any of us would – and we’re glad this was clear,” said a source close to Meghan, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity. “We are happy that the judge has agreed to pro­tect these five in­di­vid­u­als.”</p>
    <p>Meghan, 39, and Harry, 35, are now liv­ing in Los An­ge­les with their one-year-old son Archie, hav­ing stepped down from their royal roles at the end of March.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly hos­tile re­la­tions be­tween the royal cou­ple and some Bri­tish news­pa­pers – which they ac­cused of in­tru­sive, in­ac­cu­rate and some­times racist cov­er­age – was one of the rea­sons the cou­ple left Bri­tain for the United States.</p>
