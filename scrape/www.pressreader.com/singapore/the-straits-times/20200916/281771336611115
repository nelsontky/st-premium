    <p>Com­monly known as the “sun­shine vi­ta­min”, vi­ta­min D, which is known for its im­mune-boost­ing func­tion, is mainly made in the skin when it is ex­posed to the ul­tra­vi­o­let B rays of the sun.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple stud­ies sug­gest that hav­ing ad­e­quate amounts of vi­ta­min D may play a role in help­ing peo­ple stave off or com­bat the coro­n­avirus, al­though the jury is still out on whether the re­sults are con­clu­sive, or why this is so.</p>
    <p>Com­monly known as the “sun­shine vi­ta­min”, vi­ta­min D, which is known for its im­mune-boost­ing func­tion, is mainly made in the skin when it is ex­posed to the ul­tra­vi­o­let B rays of the sun. It can also be ob­tained from other sources such as eggs, liver and oily fish.</p>
    <p>At least one over­seas study has as­so­ci­ated vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency with a higher risk of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished i n med­i­cal jour­nal Jama Net­work Open on Sept 3, the study ob­served 489 pa­tients from the Univer­sity of Chicago Medicine health sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients with vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency and who were not given treat­ment for it were 1.77 times more likely to test pos­i­tive for Covid-19 than those who were not.</p>
    <p>The study also noted that other re­search had found Covid-19 was less preva­lent in groups that had lower rates of vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Lock­downs and other mea­sures to re­duce the spread of Covid-19 could also de­crease ex­po­sure to the sun, the re­searchers pointed out.</p>
    <p>They added: “The low costs of vi­ta­min D and its gen­eral safety... sup­port ar­gu­ments for pop­u­la­tion­level sup­ple­men­ta­tion, per­haps for tar­get­ing groups at high risk for vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency and/or Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar call was made in med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet on Aug 3 by re­searchers from the Univer­sity of Cam­bridge and the Queen Mary Univer­sity of Lon­don, who sug­gested in­creas­ing ef­forts to en­sure mem­bers of the pub­lic had suf­fi­cient vi­ta­min D.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing sev­eral other stud­ies on the sub­ject, as well as vi­ta­min D’s abil­ity to pro­tect against other acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions, the re­searchers also called for more tri­als to in­ves­ti­gate whether it could help re­duce the sever­ity of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, an­other study an­a­lysed 43 Covid-19 pa­tients aged 50 and above at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished in the sci­ence jour­nal Nutrition last week, it found that treat­ing such pa­tients with a com­bi­na­tion of vi­ta­min D, mag­ne­sium and vi­ta­min B12 was as­so­ci­ated with a “sig­nif­i­cant re­duc­tion” in the num­ber of those who went on to re­quire oxy­gen sup­port or ad­mis­sion to in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>While ex­perts here ac­knowl­edged the le­git­i­macy of such stud­ies, they called for cau­tion and said that more re­search is re­quired.</p>
    <p>Dr Ben Ng, an en­docri­nol­o­gist from Ar­den En­docrinol­ogy Spe­cial­ist Clinic at Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Spe­cial­ist Cen­tre, said the current data may ap­pear to sup­port the role of vi­ta­min D in tack­ling the coro­n­avirus, but that “ro­bust clin­i­cal data” is needed, given how new the dis­ease is.</p>
    <p>He noted also that the pan­demic will likely have re­sulted in peo­ple here hav­ing de­creased lev­els of vi­ta­min D, given the re­duc­tion in out­door ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Con­sid­er­ing that it will ben­e­fit mus­cu­loskele­tal health and may help with over­all Covid-19 risk, I would en­cour­age all pa­tients who may be at risk of vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency to con­sider tak­ing vi­ta­min D re­place­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Gail Cross, con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal’s di­vi­sion of in­fec­tious dis­eases, took a more con­ser­va­tive stance.</p>
    <p>“If any­thing, the most these types of stud­ies pro­vide us with is ev­i­dence to l ook at con­duct­ing a prospec­tive study to ex­am­ine the ques­tion of how vi­ta­min D im­pacts Covid-19... We all need to wait for more and bet­ter-qual­ity ev­i­dence,” she said.</p>
    <p>Too much vi­ta­min D can also cause tox­i­c­ity and lead to an ex­cess of cal­cium in the body, which can be dan­ger­ous, Dr Cross warned, adding that she dis­cour­ages peo­ple from tak­ing sup­ple­men­tal vi­ta­min D to fight Covid-19 un­less they have a de­fi­ciency and their doc­tor tells them to do so.</p>
    <p>But she agreed that treat­ing vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency can be ben­e­fi­cial to one’s over­all health, with the pos­si­ble spillover ef­fect of help­ing in pre­vent­ing or treat­ing Covid-19.</p>
