    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den (right), as well as for­mer US pres­i­dents Barack Obama and Ge­orge W. Bush, are vol­un­teer­ing to take a coro­n­avirus vac­cine on cam­era if it will help pro­mote pub­lic con­fi­dence. Mr Bi­den also pledged to re­tain the United States’ top ad­viser on the pan­demic, Dr An­thony Fauci, when he takes of­fice next month.</p>
    <p>WILMINGTON (Delaware) • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has said he would pub­licly take a coro­n­avirus vac­cine to demon­strate its safety to the pub­lic and pledged to re­tain the na­tion’s top ad­viser on the pan­demic, Dr An­thony Fauci, when he takes of­fice next month.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have lost faith in the abil­ity of the vac­cine to work,” Mr Bi­den told CNN in an in­ter­view that aired on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view along­side Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris, Mr Bi­den called for Congress to pass the US$908 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) Bill pro­posed by mod­er­ates in the</p>
    <p>United States Se­nate, but said it should be viewed as a start to pro­vid­ing relief dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are re­ally hurt­ing,” he said. “They’re scared to death.”</p>
    <p>The US posted an all-time high of more than 210,000 new cases in a 24-hour stretch to Thurs­day evening, while notch­ing up more than 2,900 deaths, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. Hospi­tal­i­sa­tions have ex­ceeded 100,000 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day evening, the coro­n­avirus has claimed a to­tal of more than 276,383 lives in the US and over 14 mil­lion peo­ple have been in­fected, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Pfizer’s vac­cine has al­ready been ap­proved by the reg­u­la­tory au­thor­i­ties in Bri­tain, while the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion plans to de­cide whether to do so on an emer­gency ba­sis af­ter an ad­vi­sory panel meet­ing next Thurs­day. Vac­cines could be dis­trib­uted in the US al­most im­me­di­ately af­ter­wards. Dr Fauci was crit­i­cal, how­ever, of the ap­proval process in Bri­tain. “They kind of ran around the cor­ner of the marathon and joined it in the last mile,” he told CBS News. “They re­ally rushed through that ap­proval.”</p>
    <p>He later apol­o­gised, how­ever, for his cri­tique, telling the BBC that he meant “no judg­ment” of the Bri­tish process.</p>
    <p>In the CNN in­ter­view, Mr Bi­den said that as pres­i­dent, he will or­der that masks be worn in fed­eral build­ings and trans­porta­tion hubs. He said he will ask Amer­i­cans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s re­marks on tak­ing a vac­cine came af­ter three for­mer pres­i­dents – Mr Bill Clin­ton, Mr Ge­orge W. Bush and Mr Barack Obama – said they would pub­licly get the coro­n­avirus vac­cine as a way to demon­strate its safety.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Sir­iusXM ra­dio, Mr Obama said: “If An­thony Fauci tells me this vac­cine is safe, and can vac­ci­nate, you know, im­mu­nise you from get­ting Covid, ab­so­lutely, I’m go­ing to take it.</p>
    <p>“I prom­ise you that when it’s been made for peo­ple who are less at risk, I will be tak­ing it.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I may end up tak­ing it on TV or hav­ing it filmed, just so that peo­ple know that I trust this sci­ence, and what I don’t trust is get­ting Covid.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bush’s chief of staff Freddy Ford told CNN the for­mer pres­i­dent also wanted to help pro­mote vac­ci­na­tion. “First, the vac­cines need to be deemed safe and ad­min­is­tered to the pri­or­ity pop­u­la­tions,” Mr Ford told CNN. “Then, pres­i­dent Bush will get in line for his, and will gladly do so on cam­era.”</p>
    <p>Mr Clin­ton’s press sec­re­tary also told CNN that the for­mer pres­i­dent would be up for get­ting a vac­cine in pub­lic on tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den lauded the three for­mer pres­i­dents for their com­mit­ment, say­ing they had “set the model as to what should be done”.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines de­vel­oped by Pfiz­erBioNTech and Moderna are ex­pected to be ap­proved by the US au­thor­i­ties shortly. A top sci­ence of­fi­cial said on Wed­nes­day that the US hopes to have im­mu­nised 100 mil­lion peo­ple by the end of February.</p>
    <p>As pres­i­dent, Mr Joe Bi­den said, he will or­der that masks be worn in fed­eral build­ings and trans­porta­tion hubs. He said he will ask Amer­i­cans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
