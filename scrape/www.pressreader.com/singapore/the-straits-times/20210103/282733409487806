    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A My big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take and one that I am ac­tu­ally pretty em­bar­rassed about is not in­vest­ing enough in my ear­lier work­ing years. It is ironic that I was ex­ces­sively fo­cused on my ca­reer as a pro­fes­sional in­vestor and ne­glected my per­sonal in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery dol­lar that you in­vest adds up due to the power of com­pound­ing. The les­son learnt is to put in place a dis­ci­plined plan to in­vest reg­u­larly and fol­low it.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A My best in­vest­ment has been the de­ci­sion to un­der­take a mas­ter’s in fi­nan­cial engi­neer­ing pro­gramme, fol­lowed by the pur­chase of my house. The pro­gramme has been a game changer for me not only pro­fes­sion­ally but also per­son­ally. I was able to build a re­ward­ing ca­reer, and also met my hus­band there.</p>
    <p>The house has al­ready of­fered me many soft re­turns. It is nice to have more liv­ing space dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis and be­yond as work­places are in­creas­ingly shift­ing to our homes.</p>
    <p>It has the po­ten­tial for cap­i­tal ap­pre­ci­a­tion as the de­mand for sub­ur­ban liv­ing is ex­pected to rise, with work­ing from home be­com­ing in­creas­ingly preva­lent and sub­se­quently the de­sire to have big­ger liv­ing spa­ces. The low interest rate regime makes it at­trac­tive as an al­ter­na­tive as­set to have in your port­fo­lio and can act as an in­fla­tion hedge too.</p>
