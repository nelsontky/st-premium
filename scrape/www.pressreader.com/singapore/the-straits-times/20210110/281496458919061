    <p>I have been un­de­cided for some time about get­ting my­self vac­ci­nated against the Covid-19 virus as I wasn’t dead cer­tain it was com­pletely safe.</p>
    <p>Should I will­ingly al­low my body to be ex­posed to some vari­ant of the virus when all along I have tried my darnedest to keep away from it?</p>
    <p>Like most Sin­ga­pore­ans, I du­ti­fully put on my mask, prac­tise social distancing, wash my hands reg­u­larly, avoid crowded places, and work mainly from home.</p>
    <p>Even when eat­ing out with my fam­ily, we al­ways look for outdoor din­ing places first.</p>
    <p>So far, the pre­cau­tions have paid off, touch wood.</p>
    <p>Singapore has man­aged to keep in­fec­tion num­bers down even as they surge in other parts of the world, and the fa­tal­ity rate here is among the low­est.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stand­able, if you were in coun­tries with the pan­demic rag­ing, why the vac­cine would be so read­ily wel­comed.</p>
    <p>When the chances of be­ing in­fected are high against the risk of get­ting one of the side ef­fects from the vac­cine, it looks like a no-brainer to get in line to be im­mu­nised.</p>
    <p>But when the risk is low, as it is in Singapore, how do you as­sess the trade-off?</p>
    <p>The an­swer isn’t so straight­for­ward be­cause of the un­prece­dented na­ture of some of the newly de­vel­oped vac­cines.</p>
    <p>First, they were de­vel­oped in record time and ap­proved by health au­thor­i­ties through emer­gency pow­ers with­out the ben­e­fit of long-term test­ing.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, at least two of the vac­cines, by Pfizer-BioN­Tech and Moderna, use a rel­a­tively new tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In the tra­di­tional way, a harm­less vari­ant of the virus is in­oc­u­lated into your body which causes the im­mune sys­tem to de­velop an­ti­bod­ies to fight the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>In the new method, no virus is in­volved. In­stead it uses a syn­thetic mes­sen­ger RNA</p>
    <p>(mRNA) which are tiny bits of ge­netic code telling the body to re­act in a cer­tain way.</p>
    <p>Th­ese mRNA con­tain in­for­ma­tion about the coron­avirus pro­tein and in­struct the body to pro­duce an­ti­bod­ies in re­sponse.</p>
    <p>It is a clever way of trick­ing the im­mune sys­tem to pro­duce the pro­tec­tive an­ti­bod­ies so that it will be ready to do so when the real en­emy ap­pears.</p>
    <p>But as with other for­eign sub­stances in­tro­duced into the body, there is al­ways some risk that the im­mune sys­tem will re­act ad­versely.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, the tri­als con­ducted by Pfizer and Moderna have pro­duced bet­ter-than-ex­pected re­sults with a very low risk of side ef­fects among those tested.</p>
    <p>But be­cause th­ese tests were fast-tracked over less than a year, it re­mains to be seen whether the same holds true over a longer pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This con­cern is prob­a­bly the rea­son why a third of those sur­veyed here said they would pre­fer to wait for more data be­fore de­cid­ing whether to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>It is also why the Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity has given only in­terim ap­proval for the Pfizer vac­cine to be used, and will mon­i­tor the re­sult over a longer pe­riod be­fore grant­ing fi­nal go-ahead.</p>
    <p>This was how Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong put it last Mon­day in Par­lia­ment: “We need to do this con­tin­u­ously for a pro­longed pe­riod of time, usu­ally one year, two years or maybe longer, so as to give us the as­sur­ance of the long-term ef­fect of this vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>The same ap­proach will pre­sum­ably ap­ply to the other vac­cines now pend­ing re­view.</p>
    <p>So, how does a lay per­son like you and me de­cide whether to be vac­ci­nated, tak­ing into ac­count this longer-term un­cer­tainty, no mat­ter how small it is?</p>
    <p>If you think about this prob­lem as an in­di­vid­ual solely con­cerned about your own health and no one else’s, the log­i­cal de­ci­sion is to wait to see what hap­pens over the next few months.</p>
    <p>By then, mil­lions of people world­wide, es­pe­cially in the West, would have been im­mu­nised.</p>
    <p>If there were any prob­lems with any of the vac­cines, they would hope­fully have been picked up by then and you would have had the ben­e­fit of their ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>This sounds like a sound ap­proach, es­pe­cially for</p>
    <p>Singapore.</p>
    <p>Why be in a hurry when the risk of be­ing in­fected here is low in the first place?</p>
    <p>Here is the snag though: The cal­cu­la­tions are com­pletely dif­fer­ent if you think about the is­sue not as an in­di­vid­ual, but from the coun­try’s per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>If other coun­tries vac­ci­nate their pop­u­la­tions quickly and achieve herd im­mu­nity, they will be able to open up their economies and their bor­ders, and get back to nor­mal life ahead of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It will be like giv­ing the en­tire coun­try a gi­ant booster shot, breath­ing new life into ac­tiv­i­ties such as busi­nesses and travel.</p>
    <p>There is an ad­van­tage in do­ing this ahead of oth­ers and you only have to look at China to­day to see this.</p>
    <p>If Singapore adopts a wait-and-see at­ti­tude, it might be­come a lag­gard in this race to safety.</p>
    <p>The other prob­lem with wait­ing, which Mr Gan spoke about, is that there is no telling when a ma­jor out­break might hap­pen here de­spite the best of ef­forts.</p>
    <p>If it does, a late-start­ing vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme will put many more people at risk than oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>So, from the coun­try’s view­point, it looks like a no-brainer to get the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme rolling out soon­est.</p>
    <p>When an in­di­vid­ual’s own cal­cu­la­tions dif­fer from that of the com­mu­nity’s, what hap­pens?</p>
    <p>First, I be­lieve it was right for the Govern­ment not to make vac­ci­na­tion com­pul­sory for all. Ev­ery in­di­vid­ual has to de­cide for him­self or her­self based on the per­son’s risk ap­petite.</p>
    <p>But that de­ci­sion can be made only if all the facts and is­sues that help in­form it are made avail­able openly and hon­estly.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day’s par­lia­men­tary dis­cus­sion was a good ex­am­ple of this open dis­cus­sion, and more such ses­sions should be held when new facts emerge.</p>
    <p>One of the lessons learnt from the pan­demic is how im­por­tant it is to do this and not to as­sume one knows enough of the disease when you ac­tu­ally don’t.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in ret­ro­spect, the au­thor­i­ties here and else­where were not com­pletely open over the de­ci­sion not to make mask wear­ing com­pul­sory in the early days. It is now clear the ad­vice then was based on in­com­plete in­for­ma­tion and un­der­stand­ing of the virus, but ex­perts, in­clud­ing govern­ment of­fi­cials, spoke then as if they were very sure of the facts.</p>
    <p>This point has a bear­ing on vac­ci­na­tions be­cause there are sev­eral vac­cines avail­able and they might be quite dif­fer­ent in the way they work and their side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to com­mu­ni­cate openly and thor­oughly to the public how of­fi­cials de­cide who to give what vac­cine and the dif­fer­ent char­ac­ter­is­tics, if any, of each vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The other crit­i­cal les­son of the pan­demic is that in­di­vid­ual ac­tions mat­ter a great deal but it can be sus­tained only if there is a sense of com­mu­nity to drive the be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>When you wear a mask, it is not just about pro­tect­ing your­self but oth­ers around you, and when they are pro­tected, you are also.</p>
    <p>I have come round to the view that this is how to think about vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>You should not think about it as a fi­nal so­lu­tion but as another layer of pro­tec­tion just like mask wear­ing, social distancing and hand wash­ing.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery layer helps to keep the virus at bay, and ev­ery­one in the com­mu­nity has to be part of that lay­er­ing, in­clud­ing vac­ci­na­tion, or it won’t work.</p>
    <p>Af­ter do­ing so much to help build th­ese other lev­els of pro­tec­tion to get Singapore to where it is to­day, it would be re­miss not to do this lat­est bit.</p>
    <p>As for how to deal with the untested long-term con­se­quences of the vac­cine, un­cer­tainty is a fact of life, and we ac­cept it in many of the other things we do, such as fly­ing in an air­craft.</p>
    <p>As the say­ing goes, the only cer­tainty in life is death.</p>
    <p>I will be get­ting in line to get my shot.</p>
    <p>When you wear a mask, it is not just about pro­tect­ing your­self but oth­ers around you, and when they are pro­tected, you are also. I have come round to the view that this is how to think about vac­ci­na­tion. You should not think about it as a fi­nal so­lu­tion but as another layer of pro­tec­tion just like mask wear­ing, social distancing and hand wash­ing. Ev­ery layer helps to keep the virus at bay, and ev­ery­one in the com­mu­nity has to be part of that lay­er­ing, in­clud­ing vac­ci­na­tion, or it won’t work.</p>
