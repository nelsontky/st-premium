    <p>A new study shows that global pos­i­tive per­cep­tion of the United States has suf­fered a steep de­cline, with most say­ing Amer­ica has mis­han­dled the Covid-19 pan­demic and giv­ing poor rat­ings to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>The US re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus out­break has fur­ther dented an al­ready de­clin­ing im­age abroad.</p>
    <p>“Across the 13 na­tions sur­veyed, a me­dian of just 15 per cent say the US has done a good job of deal­ing with the out­break,” said the study by Pew Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Most re­spon­dents said that the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Euro­pean Union had done a good job.</p>
    <p>And while “rel­a­tively few think China has han­dled the pan­demic well... it still receives con­sid­er­ably bet­ter re­views than the US re­sponse”.</p>
    <p>TRUMP RATED LOWER THAN PUTIN</p>
    <p>Pew Re­search Cen­tre – a non-par­ti­san “fact tank” – compiled the re­port from tele­phone sur­veys of 13,273 adults in 13 ad­vanced economies from June 10 to Aug 3.</p>
    <p>Those sur­veyed were from Canada, Bel­gium, Den­mark, France, Ger­many, Italy, the Nether­lands, Spain, Swe­den, the United King­dom, Aus­tralia, Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Just 41 per cent in the UK ex­pressed a favourable opin­ion of the US – the low­est per­cent­age reg­is­tered in any Pew sur­vey there.</p>
    <p>In France, only 31 per cent see the US pos­i­tively, match­ing the low opin­ion the French had of the coun­try in March 2003, at the height of dis­agree­ments over the US in­va­sion of Iraq.</p>
    <p>And Ger­mans give the US par­tic­u­larly low marks, with only 26 per cent rat­ing it favourably.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is seen more neg­a­tively than other world lead­ers, in­clud­ing Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin and Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Of the six lead­ers in­cluded in the sur­vey, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor Angela Merkel re­ceived the high­est marks, with a me­dian of 76 per cent across the na­tions polled hav­ing confidence in her.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron re­ceived largely favourable re­views, while pub­lic opin­ion on Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son was roughly split.</p>
    <p>And while rat­ings for Mr Putin and Mr Xi are over­whelm­ingly neg­a­tive, they are not as neg­a­tive as those for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s most neg­a­tive as­sess­ment comes from Bel­gium, where only 9 per cent say they have confidence in him to do the right thing in world af­fairs.</p>
    <p>MORE LIKED BY THE RIGHT – BUT NOT BY WOMEN</p>
    <p>Though confidence in him is rel­a­tively low among all groups, views of Mr Trump are more pos­i­tive among Euro­peans who have favourable views of right-wing pop­ulist par­ties, the sur­vey found.</p>
    <p>And in ev­ery coun­try sur­veyed, men have a more pos­i­tive as­sess­ment of the US than women.</p>
    <p>The gen­der gap is largest in Den­mark, where 42 per cent of men rate the US favourably, com­pared with 26 per cent of women.</p>
