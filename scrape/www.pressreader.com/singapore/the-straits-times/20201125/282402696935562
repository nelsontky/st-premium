    <p>Some English Premier League (EPL) clubs can look for­ward to wel­com­ing back spec­ta­tors in highly lim­ited num­bers next month for the first time since March, fol­low­ing an an­nounce­ment by the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Up to 4,000 peo­ple can re­turn to out­door sports sta­di­ums in parts of Eng­land clas­si­fied as be­ing at low risk from Covid-19 from Dec 2, per­mit­ting the re­sump­tion of at­ten­dance at foot­ball, rugby and race­courses among other sports.</p>
    <p>The crowd ceil­ing will be set at 4,000 or half the sta­dium ca­pac­ity, which­ever is lower, in the low­est-risk “tier one” parts of the coun­try once a stricter lock­down due to the pan­demic ends, the gov­ern­ment said. In “tier two” ar­eas, the limit will be 2,000 out­doors, or half the ca­pac­ity, it said.</p>
    <p>Only home fans will be per­mit­ted, to pre­vent un­nec­es­sary travel on pub­lic trans­port by op­pos­ing fans.</p>
    <p>In the high­est “tier three” re­gions where Covid-19 re­mains acute, no fans will be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>A few pi­lot events have been held with spec­ta­tors, such as a cricket match at The Oval, while Brighton hosted Chelsea be­fore this sea­son’s Premier League got un­der­way. How­ever, Eng­land’s foot­ball and rugby leagues, and horse rac­ing venues, have not al­lowed spec­ta­tors since the first lock­down be­gan in March.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said it would spell out which re­gions will sit in which tier tomorrow, based on the lat­est weekly Covid data.</p>
    <p>The EPL said on Mon­day that eight peo­ple had re­turned pos­i­tive re­sults in its lat­est round of Covid-19 tests con­ducted on play­ers and staff last week. A to­tal of 76 peo­ple have been di­ag­nosed with the virus in 12 rounds of test­ing this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Prior to the cur­rent lock­down, most of the coun­try in­clud­ing Lon­don, was in tier two. But three of the big­gest Premier League clubs – Liver­pool, Manch­ester United and Manch­ester City – are lo­cated in tier three ar­eas, so it re­mains to be seen whether they will be al­lowed to ad­mit fans af­ter Dec 2.</p>
    <p>EPL chiefs wel­comed the news, while mak­ing it clear only a re­turn to big­ger crowds will ease the sport’s fi­nan­cial prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“Our am­bi­tion re­mains to work with Gov­ern­ment to in­crease at­ten­dance to more sub­stan­tial lev­els,” it added in a state­ment, not­ing that clubs have a “proven track record of achiev­ing high-biose­cu­rity stan­dards”.</p>
    <p>The Foot­ball League, which gov­erns the three di­vi­sions be­low the top flight, said: “While today’s news is sub­ject to re­gional re­stric­tions, it is an im­por­tant step in achiev­ing a re­turn to nor­mal, along­side it be­ing cru­cial to ad­dress­ing the sig­nif­i­cant rev­enue gap left by a lack of spec­ta­tors and other rev­enue streams.”</p>
