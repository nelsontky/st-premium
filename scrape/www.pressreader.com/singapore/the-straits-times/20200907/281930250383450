    <p>MINSK • Tens of thou­sands of Be­laru­sians staged a peace­ful march yes­ter­day, main­tain­ing the pres­sure on strong­man ruler Alexan­der Lukashenko, who has re­fused to quit af­ter his dis­puted re-elec­tion and turned to Rus­sia for help to stay in power.</p>
    <p>Hold­ing red and white flags and plac­ards, demon­stra­tors – in­clud­ing many stu­dents – took to the streets of the cap­i­tal Minsk de­spite the au­thor­i­ties mount­ing a mas­sive show of force and de­tain­ing some pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Troops, wa­ter can­non, ar­moured per­son­nel car­ri­ers and re­con­nais­sance ve­hi­cles were de­ployed to the city cen­tre ahead of the march and metro sta­tions in Minsk’s cen­tre were closed.</p>
    <p>Un­prece­dented protests broke out af­ter Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the for­mer Soviet state for 26 years, claimed vic­tory in the Aug 9 polls with 80 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>His op­po­si­tion ri­val Svet­lana Tikhanovsk­aya has said that she won the vote but Mr Lukashenko’s se­cu­rity forces have de­tained thou­sands of pro­test­ers, many of whom ac­cused po­lice of beat­ings and tor­ture.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral peo­ple have died in the crack­down.</p>
    <p>Ms Tikhanovsk­aya left Be­larus un­der pres­sure from the au­thor­i­ties and took shel­ter in Lithua­nia, a Euro­pean Union mem­ber state.</p>
    <p>Be­laru­sians have been demon­strat­ing across the coun­try for nearly a month even though the protest move­ment l acks a clear leader, with many ac­tivists jailed or forced out of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Many cit­i­zens say they will keep tak­ing to the streets un­til Mr Lukashenko, 66, quits.</p>
    <p>“Lukashenko must go,” Mr Niko­lai Dy­at­lov, a 32-year-old pro­tester, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“Why is our le­git­i­mately elected pres­i­dent l ocated in a dif­fer­ent coun­try?” he pointed out, re­fer­ring to Ms Tikhanovsk­aya.</p>
    <p>More than 100,000 pro­test­ers have flooded the streets of Minsk over the past three week­ends.</p>
    <p>In a short video ad­dress ahead of the “March of Unity”, Ms Tikhanovsk­aya, 37, told her sup­port­ers: “Re­mem­ber we are strong as long as we are united.”</p>
    <p>A po­lit­i­cal novice, she con­tested the elec­tion af­ter her blog­ger hus­band was jailed and barred from run­ning, along with sev­eral other prom­i­nent Lukashenko crit­ics.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Ms Tikhanovsk­aya ad­dressed a meet­ing of the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil by video link, call­ing for sanc­tions against those re­spon­si­ble for the al­leged elec­toral fraud and rights vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Baltic na­tions of Lithua­nia, Latvia and Es­to­nia have black­listed Mr Lukashenko and 29 high-rank­ing of­fi­cials in his ad­min­is­tra­tion, other mem­bers of the EU ap­pear re­luc­tant to tar­get the Be­larus strong­man per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has said it will re­spond to any West­ern at­tempts to “sway the sit­u­a­tion” and Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin has raised the pos­si­bil­ity of send­ing mil­i­tary sup­port.</p>
