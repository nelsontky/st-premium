    <p>When his two-year-old son was di­ag­nosed with hand, foot and mouth disease in Septem­ber last year, Mr Khairul Ruzaini Jas­mani, 31, was on the sec­ond day of his in­camp train­ing (ICT) sched­uled to last two weeks.</p>
    <p>An oper­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­man (NS­man) i n an i nfantry unit, his first in­stinct was to ask if he could de­fer his train­ing to help out at home, but his wife, Madam Nur Kami­lah Ab­dul Rah­man, dis­suaded him from do­ing so.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old told him she would take un­paid leave from her job. She is a se­nior teacher at SGM Lit­tle KiDZ, a child­care cen­tre in Sengkang.</p>
    <p>“My hus­band is very pas­sion­ate about his army days, so I know how much this ICT means to him. I didn’t want to dis­turb him, and wanted him to serve it with peace of mind,” she told re­porters on Tues­day. Hav­ing to take care of her sick son and a younger daugh­ter was not easy, said Madam Kami­lah, but she man­aged, with her mother’s help.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band also called her at night af­ter his train­ing to check on the fam­ily. The cou­ple have been mar­ried for four years. They have two chil­dren aged three and one, and are ex­pect­ing a third.</p>
    <p>In recog­ni­tion of Madam Kami­lah’s ex­em­plary sup­port for To­tal De­fence and na­tional ser­vice, she was pre­sented with this year’s Na­tional Ser­vice Ad­vo­cate Award.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 148 awards were pre­sented to 91 small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises, 34 large com­pa­nies, 15 or­gan­i­sa­tions and eight in­di­vid­u­als this year. The win­ners were recog­nised at a vir­tual cer­e­mony held yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the cer­e­mony, De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen said small coun­tries with lim­ited re­sources like Sin­ga­pore must pre­pare for un­ex­pected se­cu­rity threats. “I can only say that we must pre­pare for the worst, only to hope for the best. And To­tal De­fence is a big part of that prepa­ra­tion.”</p>
    <p>When the To­tal De­fence frame­work was launched in 1984, it was still a con­cept and an un­proven one – an at­tempt to gal­vanise Sin­ga­pore­ans to come to­gether to pro­tect one an­other and the coun­try, he noted.</p>
    <p>“To­day, it is a liv­ing ideal, where Sin­ga­pore­ans will mar­shal their own re­sources and of oth­ers and col­lec­tively give of them­selves to the de­fence foun­da­tion,” he said, adding that this was seen in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Front-line work­ers from all walks of life, in­clud­ing from the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces, braved the risks to take care of the in­fected and con­tain the disease’s spread.</p>
    <p>De­fence sci­en­tists and engi­neers also worked long hours to pro­duce di­ag­nos­tic kits and bet­ter sys­tems for treat­ment and con­tact trac­ing, said Dr Ng.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies like Air Liq­uide Sin­ga­pore – also an NS Ad­vo­cate Award re­cip­i­ent – in­creased sup­plies of med­i­cal oxy­gen and equip­ment to treat Covid-19 pa­tients, he added.</p>
    <p>An­other re­cip­i­ent was Dr Ken­neth Tong, a part­ner at the An­i­mal and Avian Vet­eri­nary Clinic. The NS­man is also the chief vet­eri­nary of­fi­cer at the po­lice K-9 unit.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old en­cour­ages the four NS­men at his clinic, which has 12 staff, not to de­fer their re­servist com­mit­ments. He also tells them not to worry about hav­ing col­leagues cover their du­ties, re­as­sur­ing them that their per­for­mance ap­praisal will also not be af­fected.</p>
    <p>“We do not want them to de­fer, in fact if they broach the sub­ject of de­fer­ment, I would give them a thou­sand and one rea­sons why they shouldn’t,” said Dr Tong, who be­lieves ev­ery­one plays a role in To­tal De­fence.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter how small the com­pany is, even if it’s just two peo­ple, it will make a dif­fer­ence. It’s a small rip­ple that causes a big­ger ef­fect.”</p>
