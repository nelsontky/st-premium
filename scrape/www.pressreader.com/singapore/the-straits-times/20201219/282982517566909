    <p>PARIS Ser­gio Perez will re­place Alexan­der Al­bon at Red Bull next sea­son, the For­mula One out­fit an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Mex­i­can driver, who was out of con­tract with Rac­ing Point, will race along­side Dutch­man Max Ver­stap­pen, who fin­ished third over­all in the stand­ings and took the che­quered flag at last week­end’s sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi race.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar racer – F1’s only Latin Amer­i­can driver – put him­self in the frame to re­place the in­con­sis­tent Al­bon with a stir­ring first F1 win at Sakhir in Bahrain in the penul­ti­mate race of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing also claimed the run­nerup place in Tur­key, the two podium places went a long way in help­ing Perez – the first Mex­i­can to win a Grand Prix in 50 years – not only fin­ish fourth over­all in the stand­ings but also clinch a spot at one of F1’s most cov­eted teams.</p>
    <p>“The chance to race for a cham­pi­onship-con­tend­ing team is some­thing I have been hop­ing for since I joined For­mula One and it will be a proud mo­ment to step onto the grid in Red Bull colours along­side Max,” the 30-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“The team has the same win­ning men­tal­ity as me and I know I am here to per­form.”</p>
    <p>Red Bull team prin­ci­pal Chris­tian Horner, whose team are aim­ing to be more com­pet­i­tive next sea­son af­ter Mercedes picked up their sev­enth straight con­struc­tors’ ti­tle, reck­ons they have the per­fect part­ner for 23-year-old Ver­stap­pen.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing taken our time to eval­u­ate all the rel­e­vant data and per­for­mances, we have de­cided that Ser­gio is the right driver to part­ner Max for 2021,” he said.</p>
    <p>Al­bon, 24, had an up-and-down first full sea­son in the role and his de­mo­tion leaves Ja­panese rookie Yuki Tsun­oda, who will de­but for Ital­ian team Al­phaTauri next term, as the only Asian driver on the grid.</p>
    <p>But Horner in­sisted the Bri­tish­born Thai, who fin­ished sev­enth in the stand­ings, would re­main a valu­able part of the Red Bull set-up.</p>
    <p>“Alex is a val­ued mem­ber of the team and we thought long and hard about this de­ci­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Alex re­mains an im­por­tant part of our team as test and re­serve driver with a key fo­cus on 2022 de­vel­op­ment and we would like to thank him for his hard work and con­tri­bu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the call from Red Bull, Perez was eye­ing a sea­son off af­ter his seat at Rac­ing Point was handed to Se­bas­tian Vet­tel, the four-time world cham­pion re­leased by Fer­rari.</p>
    <p>Separately, Ineos will ac­quire a one-third share of the Mercedes team with par­ent com­pany Daim­ler AG cut­ting back its stake, the cham­pi­ons an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The petro­chem­i­cals giant, owned by Bri­tish bil­lion­aire Jim Rat­cliffe, will be­come an equal part­ner with Daim­ler and the F1 out­fit’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and team prin­ci­pal Toto Wolff.</p>
    <p>As part of the trans­ac­tion, Daim­ler will re­duce its stake from 60 per cent, while Wolff will raise his share­hold­ing from 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment also clears up his fu­ture, with the Aus­trian, 48, stay­ing on as CEO and team prin­ci­pal for three more years.</p>
    <p>He said: “This new in­vest­ment con­firms the busi­ness case for F1 teams is ro­bust and sends an im­por­tant sig­nal of con­fi­dence in the sport af­ter a chal­leng­ing year.”</p>
