    <p>BER­LIN • A car with slo­gans scrawled on its sides crashed into the gate of the of­fice of Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel in Ber­lin yes­ter­day, and po­lice ar­rested the driver.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos from the scene show po­lice in­spect­ing the es­tate car at the gate with the words “Stop Glob­al­i­sa­tion Pol­i­tics” writ­ten in white on its right side and “You damn killers of chil­dren and old peo­ple” on the other.</p>
    <p>“The Chan­cel­lor, other mem­bers of the gov­ern­ment and peo­ple work­ing in the chan­cellery were not in dan­ger at any time,” gov­ern­ment spokesman St­ef­fen Seib­ert said, adding that the in­ci­dent had caused only mi­nor dam­age.</p>
    <p>It was not clear if Dr Merkel was in­side the build­ing, a white post­mod­ernist struc­ture set across a square from the Re­ich­stag build­ing that houses Germany’s Par­lia­ment and well set back from any main roads. Dozens of po­lice and a fire en­gine re­sponded to the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The driver, who ap­peared to be middle-aged, was taken away in a wheel­chair by po­lice. “We are es­tab­lish­ing if the driver de­lib­er­ately drove against (the gate),” Ber­lin po­lice said on Twit­ter. “He has been taken into cus­tody.”</p>
    <p>A fire­fighter later moved the car, which had a li­cence plate from the north-western county of Lippe, away from the gate. Both fence and car ap­peared largely un­dam­aged.</p>
    <p>Ber­lin is home to an ac­tive left­wing anti-glob­al­i­sa­tion scene whose mem­bers have sought to stop de­vel­op­ment projects by big global com­pa­nies and oc­cu­pied empty houses.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel was sched­uled to host a video con­fer­ence of Ger­man state pre­miers yes­ter­day at which an ex­ten­sion to the coro­n­avirus lock­down and fur­ther steps to com­bat the pan­demic were due to be dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>Europe is on high alert af­ter sus­pected Is­lamist mil­i­tants killed eight peo­ple in Paris, Nice and Vi­enna in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Swiss po­lice iden­ti­fied a Swiss woman who knifed a vic­tim in the neck and grabbed an­other by the throat in a Lugano depart­ment store as a known ex­trem­ist.</p>
    <p>Four years ago, a failed Tu­nisian asy­lum seeker with Is­lamist links hi­jacked a truck and drove it into a crowded Ber­lin Christ­mas mar­ket, killing 11 peo­ple and in­jur­ing dozens of oth­ers.</p>
