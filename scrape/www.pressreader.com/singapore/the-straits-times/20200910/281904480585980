    <p>BEI­JING • China’s For­eign Min­istry, when asked about re­ports that the United States may ban some im­ports from China’s Xin­jiang re­gion over al­leged hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions, said this is a pre­text to op­press Chi­nese cus­tomers and in­cite in­sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The US has no right or qual­i­fi­ca­tion to in­ter­vene, spokesman Zhao Li­jian said at a daily news con­fer­ence in Bei­jing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>US Cus­toms and Bor­der Pro­tec­tion (CBP) of­fi­cials have pre­pared or­ders to block im­ports of cot­ton and to­mato prod­ucts from west­ern China’s Xin­jiang re­gion over al­le­ga­tions – dis­missed by China – that they are pro­duced with forced labour, although a for­mal an­nounce­ment has been de­layed.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s an­nounce­ment of the ac­tions, ini­tially ex­pected on Tues­day, has been put off un­til later this week be­cause of “sched­ul­ing is­sues”, a CBP spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The cot­ton and to­mato bans, along with five other im­port bans over al­leged Xin­jiang forced-labour abuses, would be an un­prece­dented move by the CBP and are likely to stoke ten­sions be­tween the world’s two largest economies.</p>
    <p>The “With­hold Re­lease Or­ders” al­low the CBP to de­tain ship­ments based on sus­pi­cion of forced­labour in­volve­ment un­der long­stand­ing US laws aimed at com­bat­ing hu­man traf­fick­ing, child labour and other hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is ratch­et­ing up pres­sure on China over its treat­ment of Xin­jiang’s Uighur Mus­lims. The United Na­tions has said it has cred­i­ble re­ports that one mil­lion Mus­lims have been de­tained in camps in the re­gion, where they are put to work.</p>
    <p>China de­nies mis­treat­ment of the Uighurs and says the camps are vo­ca­tional train­ing cen­tres needed to fight ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>CBP ex­ec­u­tive as­sis­tant com­mis­sioner Brenda Smith told Reuters the ef­fec­tive im­port bans would ap­ply to the en­tire sup­ply chains in­volv­ing cot­ton, in­clud­ing cot­ton yarn, tex­tiles and ap­parel, as well as toma­toes, to­mato paste and other prod­ucts ex­ported from the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“We have rea­son­able but not con­clu­sive ev­i­dence that there is a risk of forced labour in sup­ply chains re­lated to cot­ton tex­tiles and toma­toes com­ing out of Xin­jiang,” Ms Smith said in an in­ter­view. “We will con­tinue to work on our in­ves­ti­ga­tions to fill in those gaps.”</p>
    <p>The bans could have far-reach­ing ef­fects for US re­tail­ers and ap­parel pro­duc­ers, as well as food man­u­fac­tur­ers. China pro­duces about 20 per cent of the world’s cot­ton, and most of it comes from Xin­jiang. China also is the world’s largest im­porter of cot­ton, in­clud­ing from the United States.</p>
