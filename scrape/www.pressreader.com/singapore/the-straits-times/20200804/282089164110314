    <p>One of the part­ners in a firm deal­ing with glass-re­in­forced con­crete has been or­dered to pay penal­ties to­talling more than $1 mil­lion over tax-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>On top of this, Koh Che Song, 77, must also pay a fine of $26,000.</p>
    <p>Koh is a part­ner in Unique In­ter­na­tional Agen­cies (UIA), which also deals with the leas­ing of a ware­house.</p>
    <p>The lo­ca­tion of the ware­house was not dis­closed in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Koh pleaded guilty to 16 charges in­volv­ing both in­come tax and goods and ser­vices tax-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Koh, who ap­peared in court in a wheel­chair, will pay the amounts in in­stal­ments.</p>
    <p>He will have to spend more than 500 days be­hind bars if he is un­able to pay up.</p>
    <p>Koh and his busi­ness part­ner Yeo Soh Khim, 62, ad­mit­ted that they un­der-re­ported more than $2 mil­lion in net in­come for their com­pany’s in­come tax re­turns for the years of as­sess­ment 2012 to 2016.</p>
    <p>Koh’s of­fences led to $439,768 in taxes un­der­charged, while Yeo’s led to $28,157 i n un­der­charged taxes.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean pair had also un­der­stated the com­pany’s net goods and ser­vices tax payable, to­talling $82,620 in re­turns for 11 quar­ters be­tween 2011 and 2016.</p>
    <p>Tax prose­cu­tor Ma Han­feng from the In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras) told the court yes­ter­day that Koh had, with­out rea­son­able ex­cuse, given in­cor­rect in­for­ma­tion on UIA’s tax-re­lated mat­ters.</p>
    <p>For i nstance, the firm’s net in­come fig­ures were false due to, among other things, the omis­sion of both the rental in­come from the leas­ing of the ware­house and the lo­cal sales of glass-re­in­forced con­crete amount­ing to more than $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Iras said that it takes a se­ri­ous view of non-com­pli­ance and tax eva­sion.</p>
    <p>It added: “There will be se­vere penal­ties for those who wil­fully evade tax. The author­ity will not hes­i­tate to bring of­fend­ers to court.”</p>
    <p>Of­fend­ers may face a penalty of up to four times the amount of tax evaded.</p>
    <p>Jail terms may also be im­posed, said Iras.</p>
    <p>It also said that busi­nesses or in­di­vid­u­als are en­cour­aged to im­me­di­ately dis­close any past tax mis­takes.</p>
    <p>Iras will then treat such dis­clo­sures as mit­i­gat­ing fac­tors when con­sid­er­ing ac­tion to be taken.</p>
    <p>Yeo pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to six charges in­volv­ing both in­come tax and goods and ser­vices tax-re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>She will be sen­tenced on Sept 7.</p>
