    <p>More se­nior-cen­tric ac­tiv­i­ties would have re­sumed, start­ing yes­ter­day, to ben­e­fit seniors’ psy­choso­cial well-be­ing, given that com­mu­nity in­fec­tion rates have gen­er­ally re­mained low and sta­ble.</p>
    <p>But seniors can­not let their guard down and still have to re­main vig­i­lant, con­sci­en­tiously prac­tise good hand hy­giene and safe dis­tanc­ing, and keep to a small reg­u­lar cir­cle of con­tacts when go­ing out, the mul­ti­min­istry task force tack­ling the pan­demic said dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Small group ac­tiv­i­ties of up to five peo­ple may re­sume for se­nior-cen­tric pro­grammes or­gan­ised by the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion, Health Pro­mo­tion Board, Sport Sin­ga­pore and the Coun­cil for Third Age.</p>
    <p>These ac­tiv­i­ties are also al­lowed to re­sume in el­der­care fa­cil­i­ties, such as nurs­ing homes and se­nior care cen­tres, the task force an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Some ex­am­ples of these group ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude board games, class­room ac­tiv­i­ties and out­door ex­er­cise ses­sions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, singing classes will still not be al­lowed as these are un­der­stood to be a high-risk ac­tiv­ity, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said.</p>
    <p>Coaches and teach­ers will also have to be reg­is­tered with Sport Sin­ga­pore, Mr Gan added.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, ac­tiv­i­ties in se­nior­centric pro­grammes were lim­ited to only those that could be done in­di­vid­u­ally so as to min­imise in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given that group ac­tiv­i­ties play an in­te­gral part to ad­dress the psy­cho-so­cial needs of seniors, the re­stric­tions were eased from yes­ter­day, to al­low more seniors to ben­e­fit from these pro­grammes. Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have to re­main in place.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ken­neth Mak, di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices at the Health Min­istry, said: “We were more cau­tious in the se­nior set­ting be­cause the seniors are more vul­ner­a­ble... we’ll con­tinue to watch this care­fully, and as time pro­gresses, as­sess whether it’s pos­si­ble for us to pro­gres­sively... do more ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that safe dis­tanc­ing, mask wear­ing and other pre­cau­tions have to be re­spected, he added: “We ac­knowl­edge that the ben­e­fit of these ex­er­cise and re­hab classes is not just sim­ply (about learn­ing) for the in­di­vid­ual, but hav­ing an abil­ity to in­ter­act with other seniors is also a pos­i­tive thing.”</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, the task force an­nounced that proac­tive out­reach by Sil­ver Gen­er­a­tion Am­bas­sadors, se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres, com­mu­nity re­source, en­gage­ment and sup­port teams, as well as di­a­betes out­reach ac­tiv­i­ties would re­sume from yes­ter­day, with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The out­reach pro­grammes will proac­tively en­gage seniors with care needs and ren­der as­sis­tance in a timely man­ner, as not all seniors may know where to seek help, and may have de­ferred ac­cess­ing com­mu­nity care ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak also said the task force is pilot­ing the use of waste­water test­ing in some nurs­ing homes in or­der to find out if there are any signs of in­fec­tion in those set­tings.</p>
    <p>“So far, we have not found any… we’ll watch the se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tres closely to de­ter­mine whether there’s a need to ex­tend sur­veil­lance be­yond just the close watch of the health of our seniors,” he said.</p>
    <p>Seniors are urged to at­tend their med­i­cal ap­point­ments, to avoid de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of their con­di­tions, the task force stressed.</p>
    <p>Health­care providers would have put in place the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions for pa­tients to ac­cess ser­vices and re­ceive treat­ments in a safe man­ner, it added.</p>
    <p>Older pa­tients in need of as­sis­tance may reach out to their re­spec­tive pub­lic health­care in­sti­tu­tions or con­tact the Agency for In­te­grated Care on 1800-650-6060.</p>
