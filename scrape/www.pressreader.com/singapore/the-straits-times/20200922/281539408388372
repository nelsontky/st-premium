    <p>Royal Dutch Shell is look­ing to slash up to 40 per cent off the cost of pro­duc­ing oil and gas in a ma­jor drive to save cash so it can over­haul its busi­ness and fo­cus more on re­new­able en­ergy and power mar­kets, sources said. Re­duc­ing costs is vi­tal for Shell’s plans to move into the power sec­tor and re­new­ables, where mar­gins are rel­a­tively low.</p>
    <p>LONDON • Royal Dutch Shell is look­ing to slash up to 40 per cent off the cost of pro­duc­ing oil and gas in a ma­jor drive to save cash so it can over­haul its busi­ness and fo­cus more on re­new­able en­ergy and power mar­kets, sources told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Shell’s new cost-cut­ting re­view, known in­ter­nally as Project Re­shape and expected to be com­pleted this year, will af­fect its three main di­vi­sions, and any sav­ings will come on top of a US$4 bil­lion (S$5.4 bil­lion) target set in the wake of the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Re­duc­ing costs is vi­tal for Shell’s plans to move into the power sec­tor and re­new­ables where mar­gins are rel­a­tively low.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion is also likely to in­ten­sify with util­i­ties and ri­val oil firms, in­clud­ing BP and To­tal, all bat­tling for market share as economies around the world go green.</p>
    <p>“We had a great model but is it right for the fu­ture? There will be dif­fer­ences; this is not just about struc­ture but cul­ture and about the type of com­pany we want to be,” said a se­nior Shell source, who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>Last year, Shell’s over­all op­er­at­ing costs came to US$38 bil­lion and cap­i­tal spend­ing to­talled US$24 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Shell is ex­plor­ing ways to re­duce spend­ing on oil and gas pro­duc­tion, its largest di­vi­sion known as up­stream, by 30 per cent to 40 per cent through cuts i n op­er­at­ing costs and cap­i­tal spend­ing on new projects, two sources in­volved with the re­view told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Shell now wants to fo­cus its oil and gas pro­duc­tion on a few key hubs, in­clud­ing the Gulf of Mex­ico, Nige­ria and the North Sea, the sources said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s in­te­grated gas di­vi­sion, which runs Shell’s liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG) op­er­a­tions as well as some gas pro­duc­tion, is also look­ing at deep cuts, the sources said.</p>
    <p>For down­stream, the re­view is fo­cus­ing on cut­ting costs from Shell’s net­work of 45,000 ser­vice sta­tions – the world’s biggest – which is seen as one of its “most high-value</p>
    <p>ac­tiv­i­ties” and is expected to play a piv­otal role in the tran­si­tion, two more sources in­volved with the re­view told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“We are un­der­go­ing a strate­gic re­view of the or­gan­i­sa­tion, which in­tends to en­sure we are set up to thrive through­out the en­ergy tran­si­tion and be a sim­pler or­gan­i­sa­tion,</p>
    <p>which is also cost com­pet­i­tive. We are look­ing at a range of op­tions and sce­nar­ios at this time, which are be­ing care­fully eval­u­ated,” a spokesman for Shell said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Shell’s re­struc­tur­ing drive mir­rors moves in re­cent months by Euro­pean ri­vals BP and Eni, which both plan to re­duce their fo­cus on oil and gas in the com­ing decade and build new low-car­bon busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The re­view, which com­pany sources say is the largest in Shell’s mod­ern his­tory, is expected to be com­pleted by the end of this year when Shell wants to an­nounce a ma­jor re­struc­tur­ing. It will hold an in­vestor day in Fe­bru­ary next year.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to an­a­lysts on July 30, Shell’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ben van Beur­den said the com­pany had launched a pro­gramme to “re­design” the An­glo-Dutch com­pany.</p>
    <p>Teams in Shell’s three main di­vi­sions are also study­ing how to re­shape the busi­ness by cut­ting thou­sands of jobs and re­mov­ing man­age</p>
    <p>ment lay­ers, both to save money and cre­ate a nim­bler com­pany as it pre­pares to re­struc­ture, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Shell, which had 83,000 em­ploy­ees at the end of last year, car­ried out a ma­jor cost-cut­ting drive af­ter its US$54 bil­lion ac­qui­si­tion of BG Group in 2016, which has helped boost its cash gen­er­a­tion sig­nif­i­cantly in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Shell’s op­er­at­ing costs, which in­clude pro­duc­tion, man­u­fac­tur­ing, sales, dis­tri­bu­tion, ad­min­is­tra­tion and re­search and devel­op­ment ex­penses, fell by 15 per cent, or roughly US$7 bil­lion, be­tween 2014 and 2017.</p>
    <p>But the sharp global eco­nomic slow­down in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic, cou­pled with Shell’s plans to slash its car­bon emis­sions to net zero by 2050, has led to the new push.</p>
    <p>Shell cut its 2020 cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture plans by US$5 bil­lion to US$20 bil­lion in the wake of the col­lapse in oil and gas prices due to the pan­demic, amid warn­ings that it could</p>
    <p>have last­ing ef­fects on global en­ergy de­mand.</p>
    <p>Mr van Beur­den said in July that Shell was on track to de­liver US$3 bil­lion to US$4 bil­lion in cost sav­ings by the end of March next year, in­clud­ing through job cuts and sus­pend­ing bonuses.</p>
    <p>He said travel re­stric­tions dur­ing the pan­demic had ac­cel­er­ated the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of Shell, while ma­chine learn­ing was be­ing rolled out to min­imise out­ages and shorten main­te­nance time at re­finer­ies, oil and gas plat­forms and LNG plants.</p>
    <p>Be­sides cut­ting costs at its down­stream re­tail busi­ness, Shell is press­ing ahead with plans to re­duce the num­ber of its oil re­finer­ies to 10 from 17 last year. It has al­ready agreed to sell three.</p>
    <p>The re­view of re­fin­ing op­er­a­tions also in­cludes find­ing ways to sharply in­crease the pro­duc­tion of low-car­bon fu­els such as bio­fu­els, chem­i­cals and lu­bri­cants. That could be done by us­ing low-car­bon raw ma­te­ri­als such as cook­ing oil, one source said.</p>
    <p>Shell’s re­struc­tur­ing drive mir­rors moves in re­cent months by Euro­pean ri­vals BP and Eni, which both plan to re­duce their fo­cus on oil and gas in the com­ing decade and build new low-car­bon busi­nesses.</p>
