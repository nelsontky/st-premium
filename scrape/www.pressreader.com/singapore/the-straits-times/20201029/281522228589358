    <p>For telling a story about de­ter­mi­na­tion and ap­pre­ci­a­tion, The Straits Times’ as­sis­tant sports ed­i­tor Ro­hit Bri­j­nath won the Most In­spir­ing Sport Story of the Year accolade at the Sin­ga­pore Sports Awards yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is his third win in the cat­e­gory af­ter pre­vi­ous wins in 2016 and 2017.</p>
    <p>Bri­j­nath, 58, was not present at the cer­e­mony, which was held at the Sport Sin­ga­pore Au­di­to­rium at the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub, as he is not in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He won the gong for his col­umn “Heroes are found on all types of wheels”, which he penned af­ter for­mer na­tional swim­mer and Par­a­lympian Theresa Goh called time on her com­pet­i­tive ca­reer.</p>
    <p>It tells the story of Goh’s unique char­ac­ter, her con­tri­bu­tions and also her friend­ship with fel­low para-swim­mer Yip Pin Xiu, as well as the lessons they have taught through their pur­suit of sport­ing ex­cel­lence.</p>
    <p>Said Bri­j­nath: “It’s been a priv­i­lege to know these two hon­est, funny, in­spir­ing, ca­pa­ble ath­letes, from whom I have learnt a lot about sport, friend­ship and life.</p>
    <p>“When Theresa re­tired, I felt I had to write some­thing and some­how it was only fit­ting to in­clude Pin Xiu in the story.”</p>
    <p>Bri­j­nath has been with The Straits Times since 2007.</p>
    <p>In 34 years of sportswrit­ing he has cov­ered the Olympics, Asian Games, cricket World Cups, ten­nis Grand Slams and writ­ten for news­pa­pers in India and Aus­tralia and also for the BBC South-Asia web­site.</p>
    <p>He has also co-au­thored a book with India’s Olympic shoot­ing gold medal­list Abhinav Bin­dra.</p>
