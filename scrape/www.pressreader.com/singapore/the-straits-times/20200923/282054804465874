    <p>Those look­ing to be part of com­mu­nity groups near them can get to know their neigh­bours bet­ter us­ing the SRX Com­mu­nity fea­ture avail­able on the prop­erty plat­form’s app.</p>
    <p>Users will be au­to­mat­i­cally added to the com­mu­nity groups with oth­ers in the plan­ning area, sub­zones or even the spe­cific Hous­ing Board or pri­vate apart­ment block they live in.</p>
    <p>“Now neigh­bours can in­stantly con­nect dig­i­tally within the SRX Com­mu­nity, and, if they wish, de­velop closer ties off­line as well,” said SRX chief ex­ec­u­tive Jason Barakat-Brown in a state­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The SRX Com­mu­nity fea­ture works by build­ing on the mySG Home ser­vice, which is also avail­able on the SRX app. The ser­vice en­ables users to keep track of the sale and rental value of their home.</p>
    <p>Those us­ing the mySG Home ser­vice on the SRX app will be given au­to­matic ac­cess to com­mu­nity groups based on the prop­er­ties they are track­ing, which can also in­clude their place of res­i­dence.</p>
    <p>The SRX app dis­plays the num­ber of mem­bers in each com­mu­nity group, but per­sonal de­tails are not shared by SRX in the com­mu­nity, in or­der to pro­tect mem­bers’ pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>The mySG Home ser­vice, which can also no­tify users of nearby prop­erty trans­ac­tions and helps them ap­ply for loans and in­surance cov­er­age, is also avail­able on SRX’s web­site.</p>
    <p>How­ever, SRX Com­mu­nity is avail­able only on the SRX app, which can be down­loaded from the Ap­ple App Store and Google Play Store.</p>
    <p>SRX is run by StreetSine Tech­nol­ogy Group, which is a sub­sidiary of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings, the pub­lisher of The Straits Times.</p>
