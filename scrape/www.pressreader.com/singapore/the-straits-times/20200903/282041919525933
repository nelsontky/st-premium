    <p>De­spite some suc­cess in fight­ing dengue, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) yes­ter­day said it is sus­tain­ing its ef­forts to keep the cur­rent out­break un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Since the start of last month, the num­ber of weekly dengue cases has fallen, with 1,155 cases re­ported last week, 133 lower than the 1,288 cases the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>NEA also de­tected about 50 per cent fewer Aedes mos­qui­toes breed­ing in town coun­cil-man­aged ar­eas dur­ing the month, com­pared with the month be­fore.</p>
    <p>But NEA said the num­ber of cases re­mains high as Sin­ga­pore is still in the midst of the tra­di­tional peak dengue sea­son, which lasts from around May to Oc­to­ber yearly.</p>
    <p>“Ur­gent com­mu­nity ac­tion to carry out vec­tor con­trol mea­sures, and in­di­vid­u­als tak­ing proac­tive steps to pro­tect against dengue, are thus crit­i­cal,” it said.</p>
    <p>The agency added that town coun­cils have in­ten­si­fied their con­trol ef­forts, and in­creased the num­ber of dengue clus­ters where drain clean­ing is con­ducted. Twice as many clus­ters, to­talling 213, had their drains cleaned last month com­pared with the month be­fore.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the 37 co­or­di­nated fog­gings car­ried out last month was dou­ble that of July.</p>
    <p>On the whole, 2,052 of 2,392 dengue clus­ters, or about 85 per cent re­ported this year, have been closed.</p>
    <p>About 42 per cent of dengue cases in ac­tive clus­ters re­side in HDB es­tates man­aged by town coun­cils.</p>
    <p>NEA urged res­i­dents liv­ing in dengue clus­ters to pro­tect them­selves by ap­ply­ing mos­quito re­pel­lent reg­u­larly, wear­ing long-sleeve tops and long pants, and spray­ing in­sec­ti­cide in dark cor­ners around the home, such as be­hind cur­tains and un­der beds.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to on­go­ing is­land­wide con­trol ef­forts, NEA has con­tin­ued with its dengue in­spec­tion and out­reach ef­forts, and has con­ducted more than 638,000 in­spec­tions in the first eight months of this year.</p>
    <p>Together with other gov­ern­ment agen­cies like the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion, it has also dis­trib­uted more than 215,000 bot­tles of mos­quito re­pel­lent to house­holds in ac­tive dengue clus­ter ar­eas through house vis­its up to Tues­day.</p>
    <p>NEA said its staff and vol­un­teers will con­tinue to en­gage res­i­dents in large dengue clus­ters on week­ends, hav­ing reached out to more than 90,000 peo­ple since late June.</p>
    <p>This year’s dengue out­break has been the largest, with 27,281 cases re­ported in the first 35 weeks, sur­pass­ing the pre­vi­ous high of 22,170 re­ported in 2013.</p>
    <p>As at Aug 5, 20 peo­ple aged between 25 and 92 have died of dengue this year.</p>
