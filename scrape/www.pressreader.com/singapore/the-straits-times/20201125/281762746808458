    <p>There were 18 new coro­n­avirus cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, all of which were im­ported, in­clud­ing 13 who are for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>There were also no ac­tive Covid-19 clus­ters for the first time since Feb 3, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This was af­ter the clus­ter at Cas­sia @ Pen­juru at 15 Pen­juru Walk was closed as it had no new cases for the past two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods, or 28 days.</p>
    <p>With yes­ter­day’s new cases all be­ing im­ported, it means that there were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from worker dor­mi­to­ries for the 14th day in a row.</p>
    <p>This is the long­est stretch with­out a com­mu­nity case since the first coro­n­avirus case was re­ported in Sin­ga­pore on Jan 23.</p>
    <p>There were 12 days be­tween the first re­ported case, which was im­ported, and the first recorded com­mu­nity cases on Feb 4.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,183.</p>
    <p>The new pa­tients had been placed on stay-home no­tice on their ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Of the 18 new cases, two were Sin­ga­pore­ans who re­turned from the Nether­lands and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The other cases were a 37-yearold male work pass holder and a 35-year-old fe­male de­pen­dant’s pass holder who both ar­rived from Pak­istan, as well as a 47-year-old male short-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from the Philip­pines to board a ship docked in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week, said MOH.</p>
    <p>With eight cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,064 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 37 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 39 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>One pa­tient is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
