    <p>The pan­demic has made it even more im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to main­tain its global con­nec­tions while con­tin­u­ing to in­no­vate and dig­i­talise, said Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran noted: “With lock­downs and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in many coun­tries, the ways in which we live, work and play have also been al­tered per­ma­nently.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has re­in­forced the im­per­a­tive for busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als to be dig­i­tally ready. Busi­nesses must... lay the dig­i­tal foun­da­tion for fu­ture growth and com­pet­i­tive­ness. Coun­tries must do like­wise.”</p>
    <p>Go­ing dig­i­tal does not just al­low busi­nesses to over­come short-term pan­demic chal­lenges, but also po­si­tions them to reap long-term eco­nomic ben­e­fits, said Mr Iswaran at a vir­tual event to mark DBS Dig­i­tal Day. Dur­ing the event, pan­el­lists dis­cussed how busi­nesses can nav­i­gate the un­prece­dented en­vi­ron­ment caused by the pan­demic and the im­por­tance of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion to sur­vive and thrive in the “next nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>“It al­lows busi­nesses to con­nect to global mar­kets... and ex­pand their cus­tomer base. Busi­nesses should there­fore seize this op­por­tu­nity to re­or­gan­ise their re­sources, re­vamp their mod­els and re­design cus­tomer en­gage­ment.”</p>
    <p>He said the Gov­ern­ment recog­nises small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) may need help in this area and has in­creased sup­port. For ex­am­ple, the Grow Dig­i­tal ini­tia­tive launched in June un­der the SMEs Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme en­ables firms to tap over­seas mar­kets despite travel curbs by par­tic­i­pat­ing in e-com­merce plat­forms. Over 1,400 firms now trans­act on these plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“Emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies such as blockchain, cloud and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence present op­por­tu­ni­ties for in­no­va­tion with ben­e­fi­cial out­comes such as smarter and more trans­par­ent sup­ply chains,” Mr Iswaran said.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also un­der­scored the im­por­tance of in­vest­ing in dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity in­fra­struc­ture and cy­ber se­cu­rity, he added, not­ing that Sin­ga­pore is on track to of­fer na­tion­wide 5G cov­er­age by 2025.</p>
    <p>Be­sides in­no­vat­ing, Sin­ga­pore also has to en­sure it stays con­nected glob­ally, he said. “Covid-19 has led to pro­found dis­rup­tions in global trade and sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>“This has forced both coun­tries and busi­nesses to think be­yond cost ef­fi­ciency and growth, to pri­ori­tise re­silience, and against the back­drop of grow­ing ten­sions be­tween the ma­jor pow­ers, the mer­its of free trade and global in­te­gra­tion are in­creas­ingly be­ing chal­lenged by pop­ulist rhetoric.”</p>
    <p>He added: “While the pan­demic has prompted some coun­tries to look in­wards, we be­lieve that a more ef­fec­tive way to build re­silience is through open­ness and greater di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion. The global al­liance of na­tions must com­mit to keep­ing mar­kets open and trade flow­ing.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has 25 free trade agree­ments that give firms pref­er­en­tial ac­cess with lower tar­iffs and non­tar­iff bar­ri­ers to economies that rep­re­sent more than 85 per cent of global gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>It is also build­ing a global net­work of dig­i­tal part­ner­ships so firms can man­age their plat­forms and dig­i­tal ser­vices out­side Sin­ga­pore, he said.</p>
    <p>Lastly, Mr Iswaran noted that growth has to be in­clu­sive so that all seg­ments of so­ci­ety can en­joy the ben­e­fits of go­ing dig­i­tal. “As in­ter­ac­tions and com­merce shift on­line, busi­nesses will need to dou­ble down on ef­forts to equip their em­ploy­ees with tech-re­lated skills and in­vest in tech tal­ent to boost their com­pet­i­tive­ness.”</p>
    <p>The el­derly and the vul­ner­a­ble will also need more sup­port: 1,000 dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors are now help­ing stall­hold­ers adopt e-pay­ment so­lu­tions and teach se­niors dig­i­tal skills.</p>
    <p>“How well we emerge from this cri­sis will de­pend crit­i­cally on how busi­nesses, in­dus­tries, the labour move­ment and gov­ern­ments come to­gether and take the nec­es­sary steps to adapt, col­lab­o­rate and build a firm foun­da­tion for the ‘next nor­mal’,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran added dur­ing the panel dis­cus­sion that col­lab­o­ra­tion is vi­tal, say­ing: “Some do­mains are mov­ing faster, like lo­gis­tics, fi­nan­cial ser­vices – you’ve al­ready moved very far in this space. Oth­ers are a bit fur­ther be­hind and learn­ing from each other is go­ing to be a key part of this.”</p>
