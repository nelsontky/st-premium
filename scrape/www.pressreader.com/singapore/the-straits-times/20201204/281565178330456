    <p>Caterer Spize and re­lated com­pany Spize Events were fined $32,000 in to­tal yes­ter­day over a mass food poi­son­ing in­ci­dent that made more than 60 peo­ple sick and killed an aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cer. The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers and the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency said the firms were con­victed of 14 of­fences re­lated to the Novem­ber 2018 in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, sal­mo­nella was found on the sur­faces of a kitchen the two Spize com­pa­nies share, and in some of the ready-to-eat food. Fae­cal mat­ter was also de­tected in the ready-to-eat food and kitchen tools.</p>
    <p>Food caterer Spize and its re­lated com­pany Spize Events were fined $32,000 in to­tal yes­ter­day over a mass food poi­son­ing in­ci­dent that made more than 60 peo­ple sick and killed an aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) and the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) said in a state­ment that the com­pa­nies were con­victed of 14 of­fences re­lated to the Novem­ber 2018 in­ci­dent, in­clud­ing for pos­sess­ing food un­fit for hu­man con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies had sup­plied bento boxes to se­cu­rity firm Brink’s Sin­ga­pore for a com­pany event to cel­e­brate Deep­avali on Nov 6. Of the 96 peo­ple who ate the de­liv­ered food, 63 de­vel­oped gas­troen­teri­tis symp­toms and 45 were sub­se­quently hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamad Fadli Mohd Saleh, 38, died eight days later of sep­sis and multi-or­gan fail­ure brought about by acute gas­troen­teri­tis.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, there was in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to link Mr Mo­hamad Fadli’s death to the neg­li­gence of any par­tic­u­lar in­di­vid­ual. As a re­sult, no charges were pre­ferred against any in­di­vid­ual,” said the AGC and SFA.</p>
    <p>The Spize case was one of four ma­jor food poi­son­ing out­breaks in 2018, which prompted the au­thor­i­ties to im­pose harsher penal­ties and push for de­ter­rent sen­tences.</p>
    <p>Spize Events, a restau­rant, and take­away out­let Spize were handed the max­i­mum fine of $10,000 for the charge of pos­sess­ing food un­fit for hu­man con­sump­tion in re­la­tion to the food the com­pa­nies sent to Brink’s Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They were also found guilty of of­fences re­lated to the hir­ing of un­reg­is­tered food han­dlers, prepa­ra­tion of food on un­li­censed premises, and for fail­ing to keep cook­ing uten­sils and kitchen sur­faces clean.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, sal­mo­nella was found on the sur­faces of a kitchen the two com­pa­nies share, and in some of the ready-to-eat food. Fae­cal mat­ter was also de­tected in the ready-toeat food and kitchen tools.</p>
    <p>Most of the hos­pi­talised in­di­vid­u­als were dis­cov­ered to have been in­fected by sal­mo­nella strains. “Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health, this com­mon source out­break of sal­mo­nella was unusu­ally se­vere due to the short in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod and high num­ber of hos­pi­talised cases,” said court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The op­er­at­ing li­cences of Spize and Spize Events, which were based in River Val­ley, were can­celled on Dec 6 that year.</p>
    <p>There are two other Spize out­lets in Be­dok and Ri­fle Range Road that re­main op­er­a­tional.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mr Mo­hamad Fadli’s widow is seek­ing more than $630,000 in dam­ages from Spize and Spize Events. The case is cur­rently be­fore the High Court.</p>
    <p>SFA added that it con­ducts reg­u­lar in­spec­tions of food re­tail out­lets and will take strict en­force­ment ac­tions against those who fail to com­ply with food safety reg­u­la­tions.</p>
