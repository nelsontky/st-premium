    <p>A man was con­victed yes­ter­day of mo­lest­ing a female sub­or­di­nate in 2016 when he was a se­nior pub­lic ser­vant in an ed­u­ca­tion-re­lated gov­ern­ment body.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, 67, had ear­lier claimed trial to six counts of mo­lesta­tion in­volv­ing the vic­tim and an­other woman.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dis­trict Judge John Ng found him guilty of mo­lest­ing the vic­tim, who was 55 years old at the time.</p>
    <p>The man was ac­quit­ted of the five other mo­lesta­tion charges linked to the other woman, who was then 43 years old.</p>
    <p>The man, who has since re­tired, still has three other pend­ing mo­lesta­tion charges in­volv­ing the older woman, and these will be dealt with at a later date.</p>
    <p>De­tails about the of­fender, the gov­ern­ment body he worked for and the po­si­tion he held can­not be re­vealed ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the women’s iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing his ver­dict yes­ter­day, Dis­trict Judge Ng said that there were “ma­te­rial in­con­sis­ten­cies” be­tween the younger woman’s po­lice state­ment and her ev­i­dence in court.</p>
    <p>The judge, how­ever, found that the older woman’s ev­i­dence was “co­gent and re­li­able”.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the man tar­geted the older woman in mid-2016 by hug­ging her tightly.</p>
    <p>In their sub­mis­sions, Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tors Goh Yi Ling and Emily Koh said that she did not dare con­front him as she did not want to jeop­ar­dise her job.</p>
    <p>They said: “The work­place ought to be a safe en­vi­ron­ment free from sex­ual ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>“Para­dox­i­cally, when the per­pe­tra­tor is one’s own im­me­di­ate su­per­vi­sor, the hor­rors of sex­ual ha­rass­ment are ex­ac­er­bated by in­her­ent power dy­nam­ics which shield the per­pe­tra­tor, and sti­fle vic­tims into si­lence.”</p>
    <p>The court heard that the woman be­came emo­tion­ally trau­ma­tised to the ex­tent that “the mere men­tion of his name” or an e-mail from the man would cause her to “freak out”.</p>
    <p>The court also heard that at the end of 2016, the woman de­vel­oped a “host of se­ri­ous health prob­lems”, in­clud­ing a per­sis­tent cough that af­fected her lungs, heart pal­pi­ta­tions, and a chronic mi­graine.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tors said: “On one oc­ca­sion, she fainted in the of­fice, re­quir­ing an am­bu­lance. Her men­tal health was also af­fected, and she grew ‘very de­pressed’.</p>
    <p>“At one point, she be­came sui­ci­dal. Her de­te­ri­o­rat­ing re­la­tion­ship with the ac­cused and in­creas­ing dif­fi­cul­ties in work­ing with him proved to be added stres­sors which cul­mi­nated in her health ‘hit­ting rock bot­tom’ in 2017.” The man had been ac­cused of mo­lest­ing the younger woman be­tween March and Septem­ber in 2016, by acts such as hug­ging her tightly and press­ing his pri­vate parts against her right up­per arm.</p>
    <p>The court heard that in De­cem­ber 2017, the older woman ap­proached the younger woman, telling her she was un­der tremen­dous stress caused by the man.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tors said that in a con­ver­sa­tion in March 2018, the older woman sud­denly asked the younger woman if she had a prob­lem with the man “touch­ing her”.</p>
    <p>The pair had a meet­ing with their other se­niors on March 28, 2018, and the po­lice were alerted.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trial, the man tes­ti­fied that he hugged the younger woman only twice and that she was the one who had ini­ti­ated the hugs.</p>
    <p>He told the court that the older woman had also ini­ti­ated a hug on one oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>The man’s bail was set at $15,000 yes­ter­day, and he is ex­pected to be sen­tenced on Jan 4 next year.</p>
