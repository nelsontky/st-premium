    <p>Ham­net, Mag­gie O’Far­rell’s plague novel in a plague year, has won the 25th Women’s Prize for Fic­tion. The North­ern Ir­ish writer beat lit­er­ary heavy­weights Hi­lary Man­tel and Bernar­dine Evaristo and three other au­thors to the £30,000 (S$53,300) prize, which was given out at a dig­i­tal cer­e­mony on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ham­net, Mag­gie O’Far­rell’s plague novel in a plague year, has won the 25th Women’s Prize for Fic­tion.</p>
    <p>The North­ern Ir­ish writer beat lit­er­ary heavy­weights Hi­lary Man­tel and Bernar­dine Evaristo, as well as three other au­thors, to the £30,000 (S$53,300) prize, which was given out in a dig­i­tal cer­e­mony on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>O’Far­rell, 48, re­acted with shock when judges’ chair Martha Lane Fox re­vealed the win in a video call. “I feel like I want to run into the gar­den and howl at the moon,” she said.</p>
    <p>Baroness Lane Fox called Ham­net an “ex­cep­tional win­ner”, adding that it “ex­presses some­thing pro­found about the hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence that seems both ex­traor­di­nar­ily cur­rent and at the same time, en­dur­ing”.</p>
    <p>Ham­net, O’Far­rell’s eighth novel, reimag­ines the story of Wil­liam Shake­speare’s fam­ily but avoids nam­ing the fa­mous play­wright, fo­cus­ing in­stead on his wife and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The name of his son Ham­net, who died aged 11 amid a bubonic plague out­break, is in­ter­change­able with that of one of his most fa­mous plays, Ham­let.</p>
    <p>O’Far­rell, who is mar­ried to nov­el­ist Wil­liam Sut­cliffe, has a son and two daugh­ters just as Shake­speare did. The Guardian quoted her as say­ing she was un­able to write Ham­net un­til her own son was well past the age of 11.</p>
    <p>“I knew that I had to put my­self inside the mind of a wo­man who sits at her son’s bed and watches him die,” she said. “And I just couldn’t do it.”</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view aired at the cer­e­mony, judge and best-sell­ing nov­el­ist Paula Hawkins praised a pas­sage from the novel which de­picts how the plague trav­elled from Alexan­dria to Eng­land via an in­fected flea aboard a ship.</p>
    <p>O’Far­rell said she had writ­ten that chap­ter two years ago, long be­fore Covid-19 struck.</p>
    <p>“In the last six months, my re­la­tion­ship with (the novel) has al­tered.</p>
    <p>“I feel closer to the char­ac­ters, to the ex­pe­ri­ence that the El­iz­a­bethans must have un­der­gone, be­cause they were con­stantly ter­ri­fied of this dis­ease, among many oth­ers, and they would have con­stantly been in what we now call lock­down re­peat­edly through­out their lives.”</p>
    <p>The award, pre­vi­ously known as the Or­ange Prize and the Bai­leys Women’s Prize for Fic­tion, was set up in 1996 to cel­e­brate and pro­mote in­ter­na­tional fic­tion by women through­out the world.</p>
    <p>It recog­nises the best full-length novel of the year, writ­ten in English by a wo­man and pub­lished in the</p>
    <p>United King­dom be­tween April 1 last year and March 31 this year.</p>
    <p>Past win­ners in­clude Zadie Smith for On Beauty, Chi­ma­manda Ngozi Adichie for Half Of A Yel­low Sun and Kamila Sham­sie for Home Fire.</p>
    <p>This year, Lee Jing-Jing be­came the first Sin­ga­porean to be long-listed for the award for her novel How We Dis­ap­peared, about “com­fort women” dur­ing the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion of Singapore, though she did not make the short­list.</p>
    <p>Ham­net beat Man­tel’s The Mir­ror And The Light, the epic con­clu­sion to her his­tor­i­cal Thomas Cromwell tril­ogy, and Evaristo’s Booker Prize-win­ning Girl, Wo­man, Other.</p>
    <p>The short­list also in­cluded Jenny Of­fill’s Weather, about a wo­man with ris­ing cli­mate anx­i­ety; Angie Cruz’s Do­mini­cana, about an im­mi­grant child bride; and Natalie Haynes’ A Thou­sand Ships, a fem­i­nist retelling of the Tro­jan war.</p>
