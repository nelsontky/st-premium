    <p>One of the big­gest com­plaints from teach­ers, ac­cord­ing to Ms Les­lie Davis from the Bri­tish Coun­cil Sin­ga­pore, is their stu­dents’ lack of gen­eral knowl­edge. This is ap­par­ent from their class­room per­for­mance and writ­ing.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old Amer­i­can is a train­ing con­sul­tant who has been work­ing with Sin­ga­pore school ed­u­ca­tors and par­ents in the last seven years.</p>
    <p>She sug­gests en­cour­ag­ing teenagers to read the news­pa­pers daily, which ex­poses them to a wide range of top­ics very quickly.</p>
    <p>Let them de­cide what they are in­ter­ested in, whether it is an ar­ti­cle on the front page or in the sports sec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Choices are re­ally a pow­er­ful mo­ti­va­tor and not to be un­der­es­ti­mated,” says Ms Davis, who is also a pos­i­tive psy­chol­ogy and emo­tional in­tel­li­gence prac­ti­tioner, and helps teach­ers and stu­dents es­tab­lish pos­i­tive re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>News­pa­per ar­ti­cles are great be­cause they are short and do not take up much read­ing time. That is al­ways good when you are com­pet­ing with de­vices and other in­ter­ests for your chil­dren’s time, she says.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to teach them crit­i­cal read­ing skills and guide them on pick­ing up news from cred­i­ble sources.</p>
    <p>In­stead of telling them why they should not be read­ing cer­tain web­sites or pub­li­ca­tions, she sug­gests hav­ing a dis­cus­sion around that.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, par­ents can say: “Let’s pick up an­other source and see if it presents the ar­ti­cle in the same way and what the dif­fer­ences are.”</p>
    <p>After all, if you ban chil­dren from read­ing what they want, it will of­ten just make them dig their heels in, she adds.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cal read­ing is not just about dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing opin­ions from facts, it is also think­ing deeply and ask­ing ques­tions.</p>
    <p>“That’s some­thing I think stu­dents don’t do a lot of be­cause they get asked ques­tions all day, so they don’t even know that it’s their job to ask ques­tions of the sources that they’re read­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>An im­por­tant skill is to ex­am­ine the same sub­ject mat­ter from mul­ti­ple per­spec­tives, then make con­nec­tions. “And your gen­eral knowl­edge will be more so­phis­ti­cated,” she adds.</p>
