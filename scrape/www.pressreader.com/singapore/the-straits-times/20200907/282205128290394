    <p>I am heart­ened by Dr Ma­liki Os­man’s call in Par­lia­ment (S’pore­ans need to ac­cept dif­fer­ences across races and dis­cuss is­sues in con­struc­tive way, says Ma­liki, ST On­line, Sept 3).</p>
    <p>Heed­ing his call to ap­proach these dif­fer­ences con­struc­tively, I of­fer two sug­ges­tions. First, the pub­lic ser­vice should take the lead in boldly ac­knowl­edg­ing race dif­fer­ences, and make a clear com­mit­ment to work with re­searchers to un­der­stand why these dif­fer­ences ex­ist.</p>
    <p>In my own ex­pe­ri­ence do­ing re­search on Sin­ga­pore as a so­cial sci­en­tist, I have con­sis­tently re­ceived sug­ges­tions to down­play or re­move ref­er­ences to racial dif­fer­ences when dis­cussing my find­ings in pub­lic. These sug­ges­tions come not just from pub­lic ser­vants, but also from fel­low re­searchers or cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions prac­ti­tion­ers who are con­cerned about rep­u­ta­tional risks from men­tion­ing race in any way.</p>
    <p>What is re­mark­able is that none of the find­ings in ques­tion seem es­pe­cially sen­si­tive – they usu­ally con­cern a topic like race dif­fer­ences in health among older adults.</p>
    <p>If the Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice is se­ri­ous about ac­knowl­edg­ing dif­fer­ences across racial groups, then we must first work to sys­tem­at­i­cally re­move these out-of-bounds mark­ers, of­ten put in place by pub­lic agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Sup­press­ing gen­uine re­search and knowl­edge about race dif­fer­ences can only stunt our con­ver­sa­tions around race.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, Dr Ma­liki must re­alise that the CMIO (Chi­nese, Malay, In­dian, Oth­ers) model is quickly be­com­ing out­dated.</p>
    <p>While hold­ing a strong racial iden­tity does not pre­clude also hav­ing a strong Sin­ga­porean iden­tity, we must not ig­nore the chang­ing de­mo­graphic re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Data from the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics show that transna­tional and in­ter-racial mar­riages have in­creased over the past decade to 34.5 per cent and 21.7 per cent in 2017 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing these cat­e­gories do not over­lap, this means that chil­dren from more than half of Sin­ga­pore mar­riages al­ready do not eas­ily fit the CMIO model.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of mixed-race cit­i­zens in the pop­u­la­tion is likely to grow sub­stan­tially.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has al­lowed dou­ble-bar­relled races on iden­tity cards since 2011, but this is largely cos­metic.</p>
    <p>Many of our poli­cies seem to force mixed-race per­sons into one race cat­e­gory when ap­plied in prac­tice, with­out fully recog­nis­ing that be­ing of mixed-race may come with chal­lenges that are sep­a­rate from ei­ther of their con­stituent races.</p>
    <p>The CMIO model needs to be relooked not be­cause we are try­ing to aban­don our racial iden­ti­ties, but sim­ply be­cause the di­ver­sity of our racial iden­ti­ties will soon out­grow the rigid CMIO cat­e­gories.</p>
