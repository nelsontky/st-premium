    <p>Re­gional stocks strug­gled yes­ter­day af­ter Amer­i­can eq­ui­ties tum­bled by the most in al­most three months as ner­vous in­vestors took profit on tech­nol­ogy stocks amid con­cerns over their lofty val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The S&P 500 broke a 10-day win­ning streak and fell 3.51 per cent on Thurs­day while the tech-heavy Nas­daq Com­pos­ite col­lapsed by nearly 5 per cent and the Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age fell 2.78 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Gorilla Trades strate­gist Ken Ber­man be­lieves the un­der­ly­ing bullish trend re­mains in­tact.</p>
    <p>Mr Kerry Craig, global mar­ket strate­gist at JP Mor­gan As­set Man­age­ment, noted that there is no par­tic­u­lar rea­son for the fall, cit­ing more gen­eral wor­ries that the rally had run too far, too fast.</p>
    <p>This is un­likely to be a re­peat of the tech wreck of the late 1990s, given how much the mar­ket and sec­tor have changed,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex closed at 2,509.64, down 22.15 points, or 0.87 per cent, with 1.64 bil­lion shares worth $1.23 bil­lion traded. Losers out­paced gainers 278 to 158.</p>
    <p>Ven­ture Corp mir­rored the sell­off in the United States. The con­tract man­u­fac­turer hit $18.99 be­fore clos­ing at $19.06, down 4.5 per cent with more than 1.7 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, AEM Hold­ing, which de­signs and makes semi­con­duc­tor test han­dlers, closed at $3.90, down 3.7 per cent, with more than 10 mil­lion shares traded.</p>
    <p>Penny stock Jiu­tian Chem­i­cal was among the most ac­tively traded, with more than 97.6 mil­lion shares traded. It closed at five cents, up 0.4 cent.</p>
    <p>QT Vas­cu­lar, which is in the midst of a planned re­verse takeover, saw a stag­ger­ing 100 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Ei­tan Kon­stantino has been off-load­ing his stock this week, sell­ing 50 mil­lion shares and par­ing his stake from 2.65 per cent to 0.41 per cent.</p>
    <p>Asia ended in a sea of red.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex fell 1.25 per cent, China’s bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex slipped 0.87 per cent, while Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 In­dex fell 1.11 per cent.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s S&P/ASX 200 in­dex dived 3.06 per cent – its big­gest fall in four months – with the tech sec­tor hit hard.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark fell 2.4 per cent for the week, its sharpest weekly de­cline since June 12.</p>
    <p>The US tech sec­tor, which has led the amaz­ing rally since March lows, fi­nally came a lit­tle bit un­stuck, said Mr Damian Rooney, direc­tor of equity sales at Perth-based in­vest­ment house Arg­onaut.</p>
    <p>“I think there was a cer­tain in­evitabil­ity about it and I wouldn’t be sur­prised to see some more.”</p>
