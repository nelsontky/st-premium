    <p>How is it that we are al­ready at the end of 2020?</p>
    <p>Of late, I’ve been get­ting up ev­ery morn­ing and ask­ing my­self this. Some days, I feel it was hardly any time ago that I was ring­ing in a new year and ex­claim­ing that we were once more liv­ing in the Roar­ing Twen­ties.</p>
    <p>Who knows what fu­ture gen­er­a­tions will re­fer to this decade as? Maybe the No</p>
    <p>More-ing Twen­ties. If they are feel­ing nos­tal­gic in 2120, they can en­gage in his­tor­i­cal role-play by stay­ing home in their py­ja­mas and ac­ci­den­tally mut­ing them­selves on video calls.</p>
    <p>“The year came and went – and it never ex­isted,” Sin­ga­porean poet Gwee Li Sui writes in The Lost Year, a com­mis­sion for The Straits Times and Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s 30 Days Of Art project.</p>
    <p>“Some con­sider it a gift of re­newal from the gods. Some say that there was a rift in space-time, and that year we en­tered a par­al­lel uni­verse.”</p>
    <p>Time has been very strange this year. I am con­vinced now that it has passed too quickly and I have noth­ing of note to show for it. It has been not so much a straight line as a piece of pa­per that some in­dif­fer­ent child has folded in half, and we have sim­ply slipped from the edge of one year to an­other and are now fall­ing into blank space.</p>
    <p>In the crease of the year are the plans that the coro­n­avirus scup­pered – can­celled events, shut­tered busi­nesses, wed­dings and hol­i­days and marathons – col­lected there like so much eraser dust. It would be sen­si­ble to empty it into the bin, all that wasted ef­fort, but part of you hates to see it go.</p>
    <p>And yet I re­call there be­ing mo­ments this year when it seemed like time was not mov­ing at all. In Fe­bru­ary, when I was work­ing alone in the of­fice on split-team op­er­a­tions, I felt time to be gluti­nous, made thick and sticky by lone­li­ness.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, time moved in fits and starts. There were manic bursts when news broke so hard and fast, it seemed there would never be sec­onds enough in the day to write it all down.</p>
    <p>Yet there was also a re­cur­sive qual­ity to those days. I would stand in the kitchen clutch­ing my umpteenth cup of cof­fee, lis­ten­ing to the drone of the Par­lia­ment livestream on my lap­top, and think: “I’ve been here be­fore.” Which bud­get were they de­bat­ing? How many cases were there to­day? Would it not end?</p>
    <p>I be­gan to mea­sure time by the length of my hair. I had trimmed it last on the day of my friend’s wed­ding two years ago, an event that had in­volved a now-un­think­able 270 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Some­where in the mid­dle of the cir­cuit breaker, I declared – to the cha­grin of all who lived with me – that I would not cut my hair un­til Covid-19 was over.</p>
    <p>At that point, it was long enough for me to tie my­self to the win­dow grille with – which I did oc­ca­sion­ally, for va­ri­ety. I felt like a Dis­ney princess, namely Ra­pun­zel in Tan­gled. I would stay shut up in my tower and croon at the lizards.</p>
    <p>Un­like my fickle per­cep­tion of the hours, I felt my hair to be a re­li­able marker of how much time had passed. It was tan­gi­ble, an ab­so­lute length. Part of it had ex­isted be­fore the pan­demic – granted, this was now the part that kept get­ting caught in doors and sat on by ac­ci­dent – and I found this oddly com­fort­ing.</p>
    <p>“Wow,” peo­ple would say when lay­ing eyes on me for the first time in phase two, “your hair is so long”. Yes, I would think. So is this year.</p>
    <p>Time is more than one thing, writes Scot­tish author Ali Smith in Sum­mer, which she fin­ished dur­ing Covid-19 lock­down and which I con­sider to be the first truly great coro­n­avirus novel.</p>
    <p>Time is “now and an­cient, time is be­fore and af­ter, time is smooth and rough and if you try to re­move your at­tach­ment to time, time will laugh out loud and take the skin off you”.</p>
    <p>“Thank good­ness 2020 is al­most over,” peo­ple keep telling me, as if at the stroke of mid­night on Jan 1, vac­cines will roll out across the world and the coro­n­avirus will turn into a pump­kin.</p>
    <p>Yet I un­der­stand it, the need for this ritual of mark­ing where the old year meets the new. One needs to set aside time to look at time. The year is boxed up and taken stock of.</p>
    <p>Time passes. This is the name of the cen­tral pas­sage of Vir­ginia Woolf’s To The Light­house (1927), a novel which she de­scribed as be­ing con­structed like a house, “two blocks joined by a cor­ri­dor”.</p>
    <p>The cor­ri­dor be­gins with a man on one day in 1910 say­ing, “Well, we must wait for the fu­ture to show” and ends with a woman on an­other day in 1920 sit­ting up in bed, awake.</p>
    <p>Within 20 or so pages, Woolf col­lapses 10 years. The house at the cen­tre of the novel is de­serted and falls into de­cay. Dust col­lects in empty rooms, things rot in draw­ers, the gar­den runs riot. A world war hap­pens. Peo­ple die (un­ob­tru­sively, in paren­the­ses). Then the house is lov­ingly, care­fully re­stored. Its in­hab­i­tants re­turn.</p>
    <p>Woolf achieves, via the ma­nip­u­la­tions of her craft, that strange rel­a­tiv­ity of time which we ex­pe­ri­ence un­con­trol­lably and in­ex­orably in cri­sis or tragedy – the way it stretches and shrinks, buries some things in paren­the­ses and fix­ates re­lent­lessly on oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Time Passes is also the ti­tle of one of my favourite ex­hi­bi­tions this year, the Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum’s con­tri­bu­tion to Pro­pos­als For Novel Ways Of Be­ing, a vis­ual arts ini­tia­tive in re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing a leaf out of Woolf’s book, its works nav­i­gate a “cor­ri­dor of time” in ex­pres­sions of still­ness and care: the dress­ing of a win­dow; the ex­ca­va­tion of ev­ery­day ob­jects as if at an ar­chae­o­log­i­cal dig; a del­i­cate pa­per pyra­mid, hand-cut with breath­tak­ing in­tri­cacy.</p>
    <p>One work which ut­terly fas­ci­nates me is Pas­sage Moist Be­ings, which doc­u­ments artist Yey­oon Avis Ann’s rainy day ritual of pick­ing snails off the road and mov­ing them out of harm’s way.</p>
    <p>I won­der if the dis­ori­ent­ing na­ture of time in 2020 is the way snails per­pet­u­ally feel. Ev­ery­thing flashes past; you barely seem to get any­where; any mo­ment, some­thing huge might fall out of the sky and crush you.</p>
    <p>Time passes in grand sweeps, like years and decades; it is also made up of tiny in­cre­ments – the move­ment of light across a room, the pas­sage of a snail, the growth of a hair fol­li­cle. All of it adds up to a fu­ture.</p>
    <p>There comes a pres­sure, at this time of year, to think on what we have achieved in the past 365 days and make res­o­lu­tions to do better.</p>
    <p>It is this that drove us to fill our days dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, to pick up skills and learn new lan­guages and watch all the free con­tent avail­able on­line so that we could say: We have been pro­duc­tive, this year has not been a com­plete write-off.</p>
    <p>Pan­demics re­mind us that what we have could be taken away at any mo­ment. We gain a new hor­ror of wast­ing time.</p>
    <p>But per­haps we must give our­selves per­mis­sion to say: It is all right, re­ally, if all you did this year was inch closer to­wards a new one.</p>
    <p>If we must mea­sure time, let us do it through acts of care, how­ever small, for oth­ers and for our­selves.</p>
    <p>There are peo­ple who did great things this year, sav­ing lives or get­ting elected or cre­at­ing art. There are peo­ple who moved snails out of the road so they would not be crushed.</p>
    <p>There are peo­ple for whom it took ev­ery­thing they had not to be crushed by 2020. It is no small thing for any of us to have got to 2021.</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­body has.</p>
    <p>“And it’s time, time, time that you love,” as the Tom Waits song goes – time for you to love, and to learn to love the pass­ing of time.</p>
    <p>Pan­demics re­mind us that what we have could be taken away at any mo­ment. We gain a new hor­ror of wast­ing time. But per­haps we must give our­selves per­mis­sion to say: It is all right, re­ally, if all you did this year was inch closer to­wards a new one. If we must mea­sure time, let us do it through acts of care, how­ever small, for oth­ers and for our­selves.</p>
