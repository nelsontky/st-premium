    <p>Em­ploy­ers hir­ing for­mer of­fend­ers will re­ceive more gov­ern­ment sup­port in the form of wage off­sets through the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive (JGI) scheme, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“For em­ploy­ers that in­clude ex­of­fend­ers in their work­force ex­pan­sion, we will pro­vide t he higher level of wage sup­port of 50 per cent, re­gard­less of age,” she said.</p>
    <p>The JGI is a scheme in­tro­duced by the Gov­ern­ment in Au­gust to sup­port the hir­ing of more local work­ers. It is part of the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to deal with the eco­nomic fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is a two-tiered sys­tem in which em­ploy­ers will re­ceive ei­ther a 50 per cent or a 25 per cent wage off­set for local em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>It will be ap­plied to the first $5,000 of their salaries, and lasts for 12 months from the date they are hired. This means that an em­ployer with a worker who qual­i­fies for the 50 per cent wage off­set and is draw­ing $2,000 per month will have $1,000 re­funded each month by the Gov­ern­ment for a year.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers hir­ing for­mer of­fend­ers will now im­me­di­ately qual­ify for the higher tier of 50 per cent wage off­set.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional sup­port for for­mer of­fend­ers through the JGI was first sug­gested by MP for Bukit Ba­tok Mu­rali Pil­lai in Par­lia­ment in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat sup­ported the idea at the time, and said that de­tails would be an­nounced by the Min­istry of Man­power at a later date.</p>
    <p>There are six pay­out dates for the JGI, the first of which will be in March next year.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo added that the ben­e­fit will au­to­mat­i­cally be ap­plied to em­ploy­ers who have hired for­mer of­fend­ers through Yel­low Rib­bon Sin­ga­pore, In­dus­trial and Ser­vices Co­op­er­a­tive So­ci­ety (Is­cos) or half­way houses in con­tract with the Sin­ga­pore Pri­son Ser­vice (Cap­tains of Lives) pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>All other em­ploy­ers need to ap­ply for the ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>Is­cos, a co­op­er­a­tive that sup­ports the rein­te­gra­tion of for­mer of­fend­ers to so­ci­ety, wel­comed the news.</p>
    <p>It added that it also hoped ad­di­tional train­ing would be pro­vided for the for­mer of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that more train­ing sup­port is ben­e­fi­cial for ex-of­fend­ers to up­skill and progress in their ca­reer. Em­ploy­ers also need to be sup­port­ive of their train­ing for that to hap­pen, es­pe­cially for train­ing that may cut into their work­ing hours,” said Is­cos ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Doris Ng, in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>She added that em­ploy­ers as well as direct su­per­vi­sors and co­work­ers would ben­e­fit from train­ing pro­grammes to help them bet­ter un­der­stand for­mer of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>“The fears and emo­tional up­heavals the ex-of­fend­ers go through when they are just re­leased from pri­son is very real.”</p>
    <p>In her Face­book post, Mrs Teo also em­pha­sised the need to em­pathise with for­mer of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>“Each year, around 10,000 of­fend­ers leave our pris­ons to start a new life. They face chal­lenges, among which is get­ting back to work. Yet it is so im­por­tant that they do, to re­turn as full mem­bers of so­ci­ety again,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>“I urge em­ploy­ers to be in­clu­sive. Give an ex-of­fender that sec­ond chance at re­build­ing a new life.”</p>
