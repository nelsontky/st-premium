    <p>BARCELONA • Lionel Messi did not at­tend a pre-sea­son med­i­cal test with Barcelona yes­ter­day, a club source con­firmed, fol­low­ing his shock an­nounce­ment last Tues­day that he wants to leave the club.</p>
    <p>Reuters footage showed play­ers ar­riv­ing for coro­n­avirus tests yes­ter­day morn­ing and the Ar­gen­tinian for­ward did not ap­pear.</p>
    <p>With­out pass­ing a Covid-19 test, Messi will not be able to at­tend new coach Ron­ald Koe­man’s first pre­sea­son train­ing ses­sion to­day, with the start of the new La Liga sea­son less than a fort­night away.</p>
    <p>Messi in­formed Barca last Tues­day he wished to leave. His lawyers plan to in­voke a clause in his fouryear con­tract, signed in 2017, which would have al­lowed him to leave the club for free if he had re­quested it by June 10. They will ar­gue that that date – nom­i­nally the end of the sea­son – is ir­rel­e­vant af­ter the coro­n­avirus de­lays that led to the sea­son’s ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the terms of the con­tract which ex­pires next year, the only way Messi, 33, can leave with­out the club’s con­sent is if an­other club pay his re­lease clause of €700 mil­lion (S$1.13 bil­lion). But, in a shock­ing rel­e­va­tion, Messi re­port­edly has no buy­out clause that is ap­pli­ca­ble in the fi­nal year of his con­tract, ac­cord­ing to Cadena SER’s El Lar­guero ra­dio pro­gramme. What this means is Messi be­lieves his con­tract with Barca has now ex­pired and that he is a free agent, al­though this sit­u­a­tion is still up in the air.</p>
    <p>Span­ish jour­nal­ist Guillem Balague de­scribed the news as a “new extraordin­ary twist”, tweet­ing: “As told by El Lar­guero, the €700m buy­out clause DOES NOT ex­ist in last sea­son’s con­tract.</p>
    <p>“Messi won’t go to squad’s PCR test to­mor­row as go­ing would go against his in­ter­pre­ta­tion of con­tract – that he is free.”</p>
    <p>Barca had re­newed Messi’s con­tract for three plus one years, and the ad­di­tional year was “an ex­cep­tional agree­ment” by which he could leave with no com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, La Liga yes­ter­day re­leased a statement say­ing Messi’s con­tract was still valid. The rul­ing body said the only way for him to be re­leased from the con­tract was to trig­ger the re­lease clause.</p>
    <p>Club pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu ad­mit­ted pre­vi­ously that</p>
    <p>Messi had the op­tion to leave be­fore the start of the 2020-21 sea­son.</p>
    <p>“Messi has a con­tract... in which in the fi­nal sea­son, be­fore the start of the 2020-21 sea­son, he can leave Barcelona, to quit foot­ball or to go else­where,” he told Barca TV.</p>
    <p>Messi has re­port­edly set his sights on join­ing Pep Guardi­ola at Manch­ester City.</p>
    <p>Span­ish pun­dit Cris­to­bal So­ria re­vealed that Messi had spo­ken to his former boss about how he wants to add to his six Bal­lon d’Or tro­phies.</p>
    <p>“The call hap­pened, and Messi said to Pep: ‘I want to win the next two Bal­lon d’Or awards, and I can only do that with you’,” So­ria said.</p>
