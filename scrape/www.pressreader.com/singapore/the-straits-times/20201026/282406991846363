    <p>STONE-COLD PENALTY</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard ex­pressed his frus­tra­tion and con­fu­sion af­ter his team were de­nied a penalty in Satur­day’s 0-0 Premier League draw at Manch­ester United.</p>
    <p>Blues cap­tain Ce­sar Azpilicuet­a was wres­tled by his United coun­ter­part Harry Maguire when chal­leng­ing for a header in the first half but the video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) dis­missed the vis­i­tors’ penalty claims af­ter re­view­ing the in­ci­dent, to Lam­pard’s dis­be­lief.</p>
    <p>“I thought it was a clear penalty. Hold­ing is al­lowed but head­locks aren’t. I couldn’t see it at the time from where I was stand­ing and those ones are hard calls for the ref­eree. It’s why we brought VAR into the game, but VAR was very quick to dis­miss it,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“They should have taken time and ad­vised the ref­eree to look at the mon­i­tor. If he watches the mon­i­tor, he has to give the penalty, so it’s con­fus­ing. There’s a frus­tra­tion be­cause the rules seemed to be mov­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The ref­er­ees were look­ing at the mon­i­tor a bit more at the start of the sea­son. The per­son on the pitch should al­ways take first re­spon­si­bil­ity and that was given back to them with the mon­i­tor.”</p>
    <p>Pun­dits, com­pris­ing for­mer Chelsea and United play­ers, were unan­i­mous in their agree­ment the Blues should have had a spot kick.</p>
    <p>Pa­trice Evra told Sky Sports that Maguire was guilty of a bla­tant foul, liken­ing the cen­tre-back’s ac­tion to a move more com­monly seen in the World Wrestling En­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>The for­mer United de­fender said: “I used to watch wrestling but this is a clear penalty. I think we can talk all day but it’s a clear penalty for Chelsea.”</p>
    <p>For­mer Blues striker Ji mmy Floyd Has­sel­baink agreed, adding: “This is 100 per cent a penalty. What is Maguire do­ing?</p>
    <p>“If you see it from a dif­fer­ent an­gle, he’s just stran­gling Azpilicuet­a here and stops him from jump­ing.</p>
    <p>He’s putting his weight on his shoul­ders.”</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent was the only flash point of a bore draw that saw lit­tle at­tack­ing in­tent from ei­ther side, with the clear­est chance fall­ing to United’s Mar­cus Rash­ford, who was de­nied by Edouard Mendy when put through on goal.</p>
    <p>United are with­out a win in their first three home league games for the first time in 48 years, leav­ing the Red Devils in a lowly 15th place in the stand­ings.</p>
    <p>But man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer de­fended his con­ser­va­tive ap­proach at Old Traf­ford, claim­ing his team were miss­ing the en­ergy of fans, who are not al­lowed to watch matches in sta­di­ums amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“In the sec­ond half, we pushed on and if the Stret­ford End had been full, we might get the goal to get us over the line, as it cre­ates more pres­sure and ur­gency,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We miss the fans, I must say. It is the same for all teams but I think ev­ery­one agrees the edge has gone. I can’t wait to get the fans back.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Nor­we­gian was en­cour­aged by the de­but of new sign­ing Edinson Ca­vani, who joined United ear­lier this month and came on as a sec­ond-half sub­sti­tute, show­ing some good move­ment in the fi­nal third.</p>
    <p>“He showed in glimpses what he can do. He’ll give us a pres­ence in the box,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “He’s an ex­pe­ri­enced cen­tre-for­ward and the more we get the ball to him in and around the box, we’ll get goals from him.”</p>
    <p>I used to watch wrestling but this is a clear penalty. I think we can talk all day but it’s a clear penalty for Chelsea.</p>
