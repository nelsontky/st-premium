    <p>There has been no abuse of power in the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis), it said yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions into al­le­ga­tions made against it re­gard­ing how it recog­nises for­eign ha­lal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion bod­ies (FHCBs).</p>
    <p>But in the in­ter­est of ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency, the coun­cil has re­ferred the al­le­ga­tions to the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau and will con­duct a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of its FHCB recog­ni­tion frame­work. It has also made a po­lice re­port about this is­sue, as the Muis in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed the pos­si­bil­ity that of­fi­cial in­for­ma­tion has been pub­licly dis­closed.</p>
    <p>FHCBs are or­gan­i­sa­tions Muis deems to have sim­i­lar stan­dards to its own when it comes to ha­lal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, and whose prod­ucts are certified as ha­lal, or fit for con­sump­tion by Mus­lims here, when im­ported into Sin­ga­pore. These or­gan­i­sa­tions can earn thou­sands of dol­lars monthly by charg­ing ex­porters a fee to get their prod­ucts shipped to Sin­ga­pore certified as ha­lal.</p>
    <p>Since April, Muis has made sev­eral pub­lic state­ments in re­sponse to al­le­ga­tions by Hong Kong-based news out­let Asia Sen­tinel that the coun­cil showed favouritis­m in its recog­ni­tion of FHCBs.</p>
    <p>A key point of the al­le­ga­tions was whether Muis’ recog­ni­tion and delist­ing of FHCBs was car­ried out in a fair and im­par­tial man­ner, and if one of its of­fi­cers had dis­played any bias.</p>
    <p>More ar­ti­cles in Asia Sen­tinel as well as other on­line out­lets have been pub­lished re­peat­ing and fur­ther­ing the ac­cu­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to these, Muis had said in June that an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion team, as well as an in­de­pen­dent re­view panel, chaired by Mr Ab­dul Hamid Ab­dul­lah, a Muis coun­cil mem­ber and re­tired au­dit di­rec­tor from the Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s Of­fice, had been es­tab­lished to re­view the al­le­ga­tions. Muis said yes­ter­day that the al­le­ga­tions were un­founded.</p>
    <p>“The in­ves­ti­ga­tions have found that Muis’ pro­cesses are sound and the recog­ni­tion and delist­ing of FHCBs have been car­ried out by its of­fi­cers in a fair and im­par­tial man­ner. As such, any ac­cu­sa­tions al­leg­ing abuse of power by its of­fi­cer is un­founded,” said the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Muis said its in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that all recog­ni­tion, re­newal or delist­ing of FHCBs have fol­lowed ap­proved in­ter­nal pro­to­cols, and the ac­cused Muis of­fi­cer had nei­ther ap­proved nor delisted any FHCB based on his per­sonal dis­cre­tion. There were rea­son­able, ob­jec­tive grounds for the delist­ing of FHCBs and proper ap­provals were ob­tained, said the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>While Muis does not dis­close rea­sons for re­ject­ing or delist­ing FHCBs as a mat­ter of pol­icy, it pro­vided a sum­mary of the rea­sons for such a de­ci­sion yes­ter­day. This in­cludes in­com­plete ap­pli­ca­tions and in­suf­fi­cient sup­port­ing doc­u­ments de­spite re­minders given.</p>
    <p>Muis said its de­ci­sion to con­duct a re­view of its FHCB recog­ni­tion scheme is in re­sponse to how the ha­lal busi­ness land­scape has evolved sig­nif­i­cantly. The coun­cil in­tends to im­ple­ment changes aris­ing from this re­view by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>In the course of its in­ves­ti­ga­tions, which in­cluded 49 sub­mis­sions from FHCBs and mem­bers of the pub­lic, Muis dis­cov­ered that there was a pos­si­bil­ity that clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion was pub­lished in the me­dia. It has made a po­lice re­port about this.</p>
    <p>“As Muis takes the mat­ter of mis­con­duct of a pub­lic of­fi­cer who dis­closes clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion to unau­tho­rised sources very se­ri­ously, Muis has lodged a po­lice re­port to in­ves­ti­gate the po­ten­tial breach of the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act and will take dis­ci­plinary ac­tion against any of­fi­cers found to be in breach,” it said.</p>
