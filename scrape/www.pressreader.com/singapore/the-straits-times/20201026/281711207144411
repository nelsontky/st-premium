    <p>WHITE SUB­UR­BAN WOMEN</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Trump’s di­rect ap­peals to “the sub­ur­ban housewives of Amer­ica” with prom­ises to “save” their neigh­bour­hoods, white women liv­ing in the sub­urbs have moved away from Mr Trump since 2016. But enough of them might sup­port him in swing states for him to eke out a nar­rower win this year.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sent­ing Mr Trump’s base, white vot­ers with­out col­lege de­grees are solidly be­hind him. But they need to turn out in numbers match­ing – or in­deed, ex­ceed­ing – those who turned out in the last elec­tion to seal the deal for him.</p>
    <p>Sara Tan­ner, 39, house­wife Elkhorn, Wisconsin</p>
    <p>VOT­ING FOR TRUMP</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tant is­sue for her: Be­ing pro-life</p>
    <p>Why Trump ap­peals to her: His hon­esty and pro-life po­si­tion</p>
    <p>I think it’s okay to protest. I think when it comes to burn­ing things down, de­stroy­ing prop­erty, throw­ing rocks at win­dows, that is no longer protest­ing, that is ri­ot­ing. I 100 per cent sup­port law and or­der and I think fund­ing the po­lice is su­per im­por­tant. I think they need, if any­thing, more train­ing, more re­sources, so they can con­tinue do­ing the great job they’re do­ing.</p>

    <p>MS SARA TAN­NER (left, with her three chil­dren aged five to 11), ex­plain­ing her stance against racial jus­tice protests in Kenosha, an hour’s drive from her home.</p>
    <p>James Crow, 65, for­mer Marine and now a lo­cal pickup and de­liv­ery driver</p>
    <p>Gas­to­nia, North Carolina</p>
    <p>VOT­ING FOR TRUMP</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tant is­sue for him: The economy and the right to bear arms</p>
    <p>Why Trump ap­peals to him: His ste­ward­ship of the economy</p>
    <p>There needs to be some po­lice re­form, he (Mr Trump) ad­mits that. The Ge­orge Floyd in­ci­dent was hor­ri­ble. But you can’t de-fund the po­lice.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>MR JAMES CROW, ex­plain­ing his po­si­tion in re­gard to the Ge­orge Floyd in­ci­dent, where an un­armed black man was killed by a po­lice of­fi­cer, prompt­ing calls for po­lice re­form.</p>
    <p>Joe Clouse, 77, re­tired school district su­per­in­ten­dent</p>
    <p>Mi­ami, Florida</p>
    <p>VOT­ING FOR BI­DEN</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tant is­sue for him: Sus­tain­ing so­cial se­cu­rity Why Bi­den ap­peals to him: His com­pas­sion</p>
    <p>I think you have to be a com­pas­sion­ate pres­i­dent. You can’t be one that bul­lies or dic­tates. It has up­set so many peo­ple with what’s go­ing on be­cause he (Mr Trump) has been un­re­al­is­tic and un­pro­fes­sional.</p>
    <p>MR JOE CLOUSE</p>
