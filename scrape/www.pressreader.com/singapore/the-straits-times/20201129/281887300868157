    <p>Land­ing a job, not to men­tion a dream job, is nowa­days a mean feat for young peo­ple in South Korea.</p>
    <p>Al­ready stuck in a fiercely com­pet­i­tive job mar­ket sat­u­rated with col­lege grad­u­ates – one they have been re­gard­ing as “hell” for a while – youth now see their prospects dark­en­ing fur­ther due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and changed re­cruit­ment prac­tices.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported a record­high ac­tual un­em­ploy­ment rate of 25.4 per cent in Septem­ber for those aged be­tween 15 and 29, a 4.3 per­cent­age point in­crease year on year.</p>
    <p>This fig­ure in­cludes those hold­ing part-time or tem­po­rary jobs who are on the look­out for per­ma­nent em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Big con­glom­er­ates – from LG to Hyundai Mo­tor – have can­celled their mass re­cruit­ment ex­er­cises, dis­con­tin­u­ing a ven­er­a­ble tra­di­tion of hir­ing new­bies based on mass exam re­sults.</p>
    <p>In­stead, th­ese firms are choos­ing to hire on de­mand, a prac­tice that places greater em­pha­sis on ex­pe­ri­ence, some­thing many fresh grad­u­ates lack.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are also in­creas­ingly screen­ing ap­pli­cants and con­duct­ing in­ter­views us­ing ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-pow­ered ro­bots.</p>
    <p>Many fear th­ese changes will frus­trate many youth and com­pli­cate their job-hunt­ing jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Ms Jes­sica Park, who has been look­ing for an en­gi­neer­ing job for the past year and a half, feels dis­ad­van­taged by the new hir­ing trends.</p>
    <p>“There seems no good way to pre­pare for it, so we can pre­pare only as usual, such as by go­ing for in­tern­ships to gain re­lated ex­pe­ri­ence,” the 25-year-old told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing dis­ap­point­ment with South Korea’s rigidly hi­er­ar­chi­cal cul­ture, grow­ing in­equal­ity, high un­em­ploy­ment and a stress­ful work en­vi­ron­ment has many youth dream­ing of leav­ing what they de­scribe as “Hell Joseon”.</p>
    <p>First coined in 2015, the term cap­tures the sense of fu­til­ity among young peo­ple who think of the coun­try as be­ing trapped in the feu­dal era of the Joseon dy­nasty (1392-1910), deny­ing them mod­ern-day op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>For, if they can­not even find a job, they feel they need to aban­don other life goals as well, such as mar­riage, buy­ing a house and hav­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>A study last De­cem­ber found eight out of 10 peo­ple aged 19 to 34 view South Korea as “hell”, and 75 per cent of them want to leave the coun­try.</p>
    <p>But the un­abat­ing pan­demic is mak­ing it tough for peo­ple to em­i­grate, and is, in fact, forc­ing some to re­turn be­cause of is­sues such as their visa sta­tus and dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture back home is far from rosy.</p>
    <p>Fresh grad­u­ates say it takes around two years to find a per­ma­nent job.</p>
    <p>And ob­servers ex­pect the j ob mar­ket to worsen, cit­ing sur­veys that show over 40 per cent of large firms have no plans to hire.</p>
    <p>Even grad­u­at­ing from a topranked col­lege like Yon­sei Univer­sity can­not guar­an­tee a job th­ese days, said com­puter sci­ence stu­dent Kim Ji-hyun, who has com­pleted all his mod­ules but is hold­ing off his grad­u­a­tion un­til he gets hired.</p>
    <p>He has sent about 10 ap­pli­ca­tions since late last year, mainly to big names in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy – such as Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics, Naver and Kakao – and he pre­pares for the cod­ing test nec­es­sary for such jobs by tak­ing mock tests avail­able on­line.</p>
    <p>“Every time I ap­ply to a new com­pany, I think I don’t ac­tu­ally need a Yon­sei de­gree for it,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“IT com­pa­nies care more about real ca­pa­bil­i­ties, so aca­demic back­ground is not so im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­cruit­ment agency Saramin, em­ploy­ers are now look­ing for tal­ent who can ac­tively cope with rapidly chang­ing work en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>Thus, they place more em­pha­sis on soft skills, in­clud­ing com­mu­ni­cat­ing well and be­ing a team player, as op­posed to hard skills proven by cer­tifi­cates and de­grees.</p>
    <p>A job seeker must now “fo­cus on soft skills and dis­play the abil­ity to cope with chang­ing times”, the agency said.</p>
    <p>Chung-Ang Univer­sity so­ci­ol­ogy pro­fes­sor Shin Jin-wook warned that the pan­demic “re­vealed a huge blind spot in South Korea’s un­equal labour mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>“The sense of ‘Hell Joseon’ may deepen if the sit­u­a­tion does not im­prove,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ewha Womans Univer­sity’s stu­dent coun­selling cen­tre di­rec­tor Oh Hye-young said: “It seems those cur­rently in their 20s have a wide­spread sense of help­less­ness, that they should not even try hard in a sit­u­a­tion where the fu­ture is un­cer­tain.”</p>
    <p>NO GOOD WAY TO PRE­PARE</p>
    <p>Grow­ing dis­ap­point­ment with South Korea’s rigidly hi­er­ar­chi­cal cul­ture, grow­ing in­equal­ity, high un­em­ploy­ment and a stress­ful work en­vi­ron­ment has many youth dream­ing of leav­ing what they de­scribe as “Hell Joseon”... the term cap­tures the sense of fu­til­ity among young peo­ple who think of the coun­try as be­ing trapped in the feu­dal era of the Joseon dy­nasty (1392-1910), deny­ing them mod­ern-day op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>

    <p>HELP­LESS­NESS</p>
    <p>It seems those cur­rently in their 20s have a wide­spread sense of help­less­ness, that they should not even try hard in a sit­u­a­tion where the fu­ture is un­cer­tain.</p>
