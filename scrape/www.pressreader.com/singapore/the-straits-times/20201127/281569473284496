    <p>Con­tin­u­ous up­skilling is vi­tal to en­sure fi­nan­cial in­dus­try staff stay rel­e­vant as new jobs emerge while oth­ers van­ish, a panel of ex­ec­u­tives said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They were dis­cussing em­ploy­ment prospects in the first of a se­ries of we­bi­nars or­gan­ised by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) and the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance (IBF).</p>
    <p>DBS Bank chief ex­ec­u­tive Piyush Gupta said: “Ir­re­spec­tive of how old you are or how young you are, we can learn and ac­quire new skills.</p>
    <p>“This is the course of hu­man his­tory, that jobs dis­ap­pear when tech­nol­ogy changes, and jobs get cre­ated. The re­al­ity is more jobs get cre­ated in this pe­riod of time than ever ex­isted in the past. So, we need to have the faith and con­fi­dence that other jobs will come.”</p>
    <p>He noted that mul­ti­ple new roles have been cre­ated in DBS that did not ex­ist five years ago. This in­cludes a de­part­ment of more than 100 staff who de­sign the on­line and off­line cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence. Other new roles in­clude those in data and dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial chief ex­ec­u­tive Den­nis Tan agreed that con­tin­u­ous learn­ing is vi­tal for both the in­surer’s cor­po­rate staff and agency work­force. He added that train­ing hours for cor­po­rate staff have more than dou­bled this year com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>“We have been fo­cus­ing a lot on up­skilling and reskilling our em­ploy­ees to meet the ever-chang­ing ex­pec­ta­tions of our cus­tomers, who are seek­ing greater speed and con­ve­nience,” he noted.</p>
    <p>A ma­chine learn­ing on­line course was of­fered to all staff this year. The firm also launched a new cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme for agents, which aims to ben­e­fit 5,000 con­sul­tants by June.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme will be ex­panded to all new fi­nan­cial con­sul­tants who join the in­surer this year, Mr Tan said.</p>
    <p>Train­ing also starts right in school, with Stan­dard Char­tered’s work-study pro­gramme al­low­ing stu­dents from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences to spend one or two days in class and three to four days at work each week. The pro­gramme is in its fourth year and has ben­e­fited 37 stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Pa­trick Lee noted that the firm has been map­ping out roles that will be af­fected by tech­nol­ogy in the fu­ture and the ar­eas that re­quire new skills.</p>
    <p>IBF chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Nam Sin said his or­gan­i­sa­tion wants to create train­ing path­ways so that even if a job seeker is not the perfect match for a role, the per­son can be trained to even­tu­ally take on the job. It also hopes to work with banks to reskill and re­de­ploy work­ers where needed.</p>
    <p>“At reg­u­lar in­ter­vals, ask your­self how many of these tasks can be done by ma­chine, and if it is more than 50 per cent, you should reskill,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gupta said that skills have be­come more trans­fer­able, as tech­nol­ogy cuts across sec­tors and breaks down bound­aries, pro­vid­ing the op­por­tu­nity for peo­ple to move from one sec­tor to an­other.</p>
    <p>DBS has hired more than 2,000 peo­ple this year, mostly ex­pe­ri­enced staff and mid-ca­reer work­ers from a va­ri­ety of sec­tors.</p>
    <p>One is for­mer flight stew­ardess Brinda Cheng, 30, who is now a wealth plan­ning man­ager at the bank’s Bis­han branch.</p>
    <p>She said: “I ap­pre­ci­ate the fi­nan­cial plan­ning and prob­lem-solv­ing skills that I have picked up in the course of my train­ing.</p>
    <p>“Such knowl­edge, cou­pled with the (cus­tomer ser­vice) skills I picked up dur­ing my time with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines... equip me with the tools I need to help my cus­tomers achieve their fi­nan­cial plan­ning ob­jec­tives.”</p>
