    <p>Part-time pri­mary school teacher Ng Wai Leng is able to visit her elderly par­ents only about twice a week, but she knows ex­actly what they are do­ing from the time they wake up un­til they go to bed.</p>
    <p>A de­vice de­vel­oped by Te­masek Polytech­nic (TP) called Smart DB Elderly Well­ness Suite al­lows her to track, for in­stance, when her par­ents boil wa­ter for their morn­ing coffee, and turn on the TV or the lights in the evening – signs that they are keep­ing to their nor­mal rou­tine.</p>
    <p>In­stalled in the elec­tri­cal dis­tri­bu­tion board found in ev­ery home, the de­vice mon­i­tors the elec­tri­cal us­age of the home, and de­tects the type of ac­tiv­ity based on the data it re­ceives.</p>
    <p>The home of Mrs Ng’s par­ents was one of 10 house­holds across Ang Mo Kio, Pung­gol and Toa Payoh where test-bed­ding of the de­vice be­gan in March last year.</p>
    <p>Said Mrs Ng: “I usu­ally have to work in the morn­ings and also take care of my school-go­ing chil­dren. I am not able to be all the time with my par­ents, who are liv­ing alone, and so con­stantly look out for them.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng, 44, lives with her hus­band and two chil­dren, aged 12 and 15. Her par­ents, re­tirees in their 70s, have health prob­lems like di­a­betes and high choles­terol. Her fa­ther also suf­fers from de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Said Mrs Ng: “With this mo­bile app, I know when they have wo­ken up to boil wa­ter for coffee, how long they are in the shower, if they are watch­ing TV, and what time they sleep at night.</p>
    <p>“It gives me peace of mind, know­ing they are safe and well at home, even if I’m not there with them.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng added that she would con­sider pur­chas­ing a com­mer­cial ver­sion of the prod­uct if sub­scrip­tion charges are be­tween $10 and $30 each month.</p>
    <p>The de­vice was de­vel­oped as part of a mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary pro­ject in­volv­ing TP lec­tur­ers and stu­dents from the di­ploma in com­puter en­gi­neer­ing and di­ploma in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy cour­ses, helmed by staff from the polytech­nic’s Clean En­ergy Re­search Cen­tre (CERC). The pro­ject re­ceived fund­ing from the Tote Board So­cial In­no­va­tion Re­search Fund, and was a re­cip­i­ent of the Lee Hsien Loong In­ter­ac­tive Dig­i­tal Me­dia Smart Na­tion Award this year.</p>
    <p>Smart DB pro­ject lead and CERC se­nior man­ager Wang Gucheng said the de­vice aims to ad­dress the prob­lem of so­cial iso­la­tion faced by the elderly in coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He said: “We de­cided to use en­ergy an­a­lyt­ics to pre­dict users’ be­hav­iour and habits. This led to the de­vel­op­ment of this Smart so­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Fix­ing what is a com­plex so­cial prob­lem in­volved bring­ing to­gether a raft of dis­ci­plines – elec­tron­ics, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, pro­duc­tion de­sign tech­nol­ogy and hu­man be­hav­iour analysis. The team also had meet­ings with an el­der­care ser­vice provider, as well as se­niors and their chil­dren who were con­cerned about their par­ents liv­ing alone.</p>
    <p>The mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem is made up of a hard­ware de­vice – de­ployed with pro­ject part­ner and tech­nol­ogy firm Smart DB – and a Web ap­pli­ca­tion-based user in­ter­face, which users like Mrs Ng can tap to check on their loved ones.</p>
    <p>TP com­puter en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent Sa­muel Tan, 18, said the pro­ject has the po­ten­tial to help ad­dress a range of other is­sues.</p>
    <p>He said: “It could flag men­tal health con­cerns that are not eas­ily no­tice­able, such as de­pres­sion. For in­stance, if some­one is spend­ing long hours in front of the TV or there is a sud­den change in his home rou­tine, ac­tion can be taken. It can also help in car­ing for those with dis­abil­i­ties in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>One key con­cern, Mr Wang said, is en­sur­ing the pri­vacy of users.</p>
    <p>He said: “When the Smart DB is in­stalled in­side the house, it is done with the per­mis­sion and in the pres­ence of the care­giver.</p>
    <p>“The one-time in­stal­la­tion takes about one hour, af­ter which data will be au­to­mat­i­cally and se­curely sent to the app. The data cap­tured is en­crypted, pro­tected and ac­ces­si­ble only to au­tho­rised users like the care­giver.”</p>
