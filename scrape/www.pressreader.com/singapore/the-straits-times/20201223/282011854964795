    <p>We re­fer to Mr Raja Ra­jen­dra’s let­ter (Bank­ing: Changes with­out prior no­ti­fi­ca­tion caused un­due stress, Dec 15).</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jen­dra and his wife used to re­ceive their CPF Life pay­ments through Giro ev­ery month. Giro pay­ments are some­times de­layed be­cause the ser­vice is not avail­able on Satur­days, Sun­days and pub­lic hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>There­fore, for more timely pay­outs, the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Board (CPFB) has switched to the more mod­ern Fast pay­ment, which is avail­able on all days.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of the mode of pay­ment, al­most all the ma­jor banks have a pay­ment de­scrip­tor show­ing both the payer and the pur­pose, that is, “CPF Board” and “LIFE Pay­ment” re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jen­dra’s bank hap­pens to be the only ma­jor bank that has omit­ted the payer from the de­scrip­tor for Fast pay­ments. Such in­di­vid­ual bank prac­tices are be­yond CPFB’s con­trol.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, we have con­tacted Mr Ra­jen­dra’s bank and it has agreed to look into in­cor­po­rat­ing the payer in­for­ma­tion in fu­ture Fast pay­ment de­scrip­tors.</p>
    <p>We have reached out to Mr Ra­jen­dra, and he has con­firmed that, in fact, the pay­ment de­scrip­tor for both him and his wife in­cluded the text “LIFE Pay­ment”.</p>
    <p>Both his and his wife’s De­cem­ber pay­out quan­tum, ac­cu­rate to two dec­i­mal places, is also ex­actly the same as their pre­vi­ous monthly CPF Life pay­outs.</p>
    <p>Po­ten­tial scam­mers are un­likely to know their CPF Life pay­out quan­tum to such a level of pre­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>That said, we com­mend Mr Ra­jen­dra for his vig­i­lance in look­ing out for po­ten­tial scams.</p>
    <p>If he is ever in doubt about the ori­gins of any pay­ment, we ad­vise him to call his own bank to clar­ify. Tan Chui Leng</p>
