    <p>LON­DON • Liver­pool were re­lent­less un­til the end.</p>
    <p>Head­ing into the fi­nal minute of the fi­nal game of their ti­tle-win­ning sea­son, Sa­dio Mane hus­tled to keep a move alive when it would have been eas­ier to let Roberto Firmino’s pass drift to­wards the touch­line, be­fore scor­ing to seal a 3-1 win at New­cas­tle.</p>
    <p>The Reds fin­ished with 99 points, the sec­ond-high­est haul in Premier League his­tory af­ter Manchester City recorded 100 points en route to win­ning the ti­tle in 2018.</p>
    <p>“This goal re­ally sums the sea­son up,” said Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp. “It is dif­fi­cult but not im­pos­si­ble, so give it a go. That is what the boys did the whole year and what they did in this moment.</p>
    <p>“It was just a bril­liant piece of foot­ball. This was a vic­tory for the whole squad, like the whole sea­son.</p>
    <p>“This group of play­ers is re­ally ex­cep­tional and they will be re­mem­bered for­ever. The boys don’t only win games on their per­fect days, they are ready to re­ally dig deep on the not so per­fect days.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool found them­selves be­hind af­ter just 26 sec­onds but goals from Vir­gil van Dijk, Divock Origi and Mane en­sured they would en­joy a win­ning end to a sea­son that saw them cap­ture their first league ti­tle in 30 years.</p>
    <p>All the pieces are in place for them to win con­sec­u­tive ti­tles for the first time since 1984, with Klopp, who joined in 2015, signed to a long-term con­tract and key stars van Dijk, 29, Mane, 28, Mo­hamed Salah, 28, and Jor­dan Hen­der­son, 30, all in their primes.</p>
    <p>But the German in­sists Liver­pool will take noth­ing for granted when the new cam­paign kicks off on</p>
    <p>Sept 12 be­cause he ex­pects a re­newed push from City and stronger chal­lenges from Manchester United and Chelsea.</p>
    <p>“We see United com­ing up,” said Klopp. “Peo­ple thought they had no chance but we see with one or two play­ers how good they are and how good they can be, and for sure they will not be worse next sea­son, and now there is Chelsea as well.</p>
    <p>“It will not be about City and us. For the last two years pretty much the top of the ta­ble was City and us, and City for four or five years be­fore that.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Vir&#xAD;gil van Dijk climb&#xAD;ing over New&#xAD;cas&#xAD;tle&#x2019;s Javier Man&#xAD;quillo to loop a header into the goal&#x2019;s top cor&#xAD;ner for Liver&#xAD;pool&#x2019;s equaliser. The Dutch&#xAD;man be&#xAD;came the fifth out&#xAD;field player to play ev&#xAD;ery minute for a Premier League win&#xAD;ning team when he started and fin&#xAD;ished their 3-1 win.</p>
