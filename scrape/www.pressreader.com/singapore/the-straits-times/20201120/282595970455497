    <p>In the war drama Mo­sul, FrenchTu­nisian ac­tor Adam Bessa is Kawa, a young cop re­cruited into a team of vet­eran fight­ers.</p>
    <p>They op­er­ate in Mo­sul, Iraq’s sec­ond most pop­u­lous city, parts of which were seized by fight­ers from the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in 2014. While the Iraqi army fled, Kawa’s new com­rades stay be­hind, en­gag­ing ISIS i n gru­elling street-by-street, roomby-room gun­fights.</p>
    <p>The movie, show­ing in cin­e­mas, is based on a 2017 New Yorker mag­a­zine ar­ti­cle about the ex­ploits of the Nin­eveh Swat team.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing in France, Bessa, 29, was sur­rounded by news re­ports about the Iraq War, which be­gan in 2003 fol­low­ing an in­va­sion by a United States-led coali­tion.</p>
    <p>“I grew up watch­ing the news about the war on Ara­bic TV, on Al Jazeera and other chan­nels. I talked to peo­ple who grew up in the Mid­dle East, and to Iraqi friends,” he says in au­dio clips in re­sponse to ques­tions sent by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Like what hap­pened to many who fol­low the news about the war, the nev­erend­ing na­ture of the con­flict, its shift­ing bat­tle lines and com­plex web of al­liances be­tween fac­tions had be­come foggy Bessa’s mind.</p>
    <p>Names like for­mer Iraqi leader Sad­dam Hus­sein would fade, but the per­pet­ual na­ture of the con­flict cre­ated a re­volv­ing door of key char­ac­ters who would ap­pear “one af­ter an­other and an­other and an­other”, he says.</p>
    <p>In the movie, his char­ac­ter, like much of the au­di­ence, is naive, so it is through his eyes that the world of the con­flict is viewed and made un­der­stand­able to an out­sider.</p>
    <p>Writer-di­rec­tor Matthew Car­na­han, with the help of pro­duc­ers the Russo broth­ers (who di­rected Mar­vel su­per­hero smash hits such as Cap­tain Amer­ica: Civil War, 2014; Avengers: In­fin­ity War, 2018 and Avengers: Endgame, 2019), adapted the New Yorker ar­ti­cle into the movie.</p>
    <p>The film fea­tures only ac­tors of Mid­dle East­ern or North African de­scent, all speak­ing Ara­bic – a unique move given that ac­tion movies set in non-West­ern parts of the world tend to make ev­ery char­ac­ter speak English or fea­ture a white English-speak­ing star in a lead role.</p>
    <p>Car­na­han told Bessa it was his in job to show how someone in a new and of­ten over­whelm­ing sit­u­a­tion would re­act – his cu­rios­ity, frus­tra­tion and fear would mir­ror the au­di­ence’s re­ac­tion, he says.</p>
    <p>Bessa says: “He asked me to leave a lot of space for the au­di­ence – to let Kawa think, then let the au­di­ence see him think­ing, so they can re­late to his think­ing process and be there in the mo­ment with him.”</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion team’s in­sis­tence on au­then­tic­ity did not stop with the lan­guage. Ac­tors had to un­dergo a two-week boot camp in which they were trained i n weapons and ma­noeu­vres eight hours a day.</p>
    <p>“I had never han­dled a gun in my life, so it was all new. There was so much to learn, psy­cho­log­i­cally and phys­i­cally,” Bessa says.</p>
    <p>“I love learn­ing new things, but what I loved most was see­ing the ac­tors trans­form­ing, turn­ing scary and bada**.”</p>
    <p>He asked me to leave a lot of space for the au­di­ence – to let Kawa think, then let the au­di­ence see him think­ing, so they can re­late to his think­ing process and be there in the mo­ment with him.</p>
