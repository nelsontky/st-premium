    <p>For­mer floor­ball coach Louise Khng’s (above) break­through as the first woman to win the Coach of the Year award has turned the spotlight on the dearth of fe­male sports coaches, an is­sue CoachSG is try­ing to ad­dress. Some at­tribute the dearth to mis­in­formed stereo­types and so­cial con­structs.</p>
    <p>The French-born nov­el­ist Anais Nin once wrote: “We do not see things as they are, we see them as we are.” Precon­cep­tions, she of­fered, can dra­mat­i­cally al­ter the way we per­ceive the world.</p>
    <p>That is why per­cep­tion, ac­cord­ing to for­mer na­tional women’s floor­ball team coach Louise Khng, is the big­gest chal­lenge for women coaches to over­come.</p>
    <p>At last month’s an­nual Sin­ga­pore Sports Awards, she be­came the first woman to win the Coach of the Year gong since its in­cep­tion in 1970. While the mile­stone is rightly cel­e­brated, it drew at­ten­tion to the dearth of women coaches and their lack of recog­ni­tion and suc­cess.</p>
    <p>STEREO­TYPES AND SO­CIAL CON­STRUCTS</p>
    <p>Khng, 37, said “mis­in­formed stereo­types” some­times form bar­ri­ers for women. These in­clude the per­cep­tion that men make bet­ter coaches be­cause of su­pe­rior ath­leti­cism, or that women are “weak or too emo­tional to lead”.</p>
    <p>“Sport coach­ing has al­ways been male-dom­i­nated and this dom­i­nance is also ev­i­dent in fields such as pol­i­tics and busi­ness,” noted Khng. “This has slowly shifted in re­cent years, so hope­fully we will see more fe­male coaches com­ing through the ranks in the years to come.”</p>
    <p>Wang Shao-Ing, who coached the na­tional women’s rugby team from 2015 to 2019, added: “I think it’s an evo­lu­tion­ary process. For a long time, the question of girls play­ing sport at a high level had to do with eq­uity. In terms of coach­ing, it had to do with some of our so­cial con­structs about who is ‘qual­i­fied’ to in­struct or coach.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to CoachSG, the na­tional body which seeks to sup­port the de­vel­op­ment and pro­fes­sion­al­i­sa­tion of coaches of all lev­els, fe­male coaches ac­count for only 23 per cent of the 5,099 coaches in the Na­tional Reg­istry of Coaches.</p>
    <p>On top of this, only about a quar­ter of the 240 coaches funded un­der the Sin­ga­pore Sports In­sti­tute’s high per­for­mance sport sys­tem – which in­clude high per­for­mance man­agers, age-group coaches and as­sis­tant coaches – are fe­male. About 100 coaches coach or as­sist se­nior na­tional sports teams ei­ther on a full or part-time ba­sis, CoachSG added, with around 20 be­ing fe­male.</p>
    <p>Track and field coach Mar­garet Oh sug­gested that the low num­ber could be the re­sult of the way pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions viewed coach­ing.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old for­mer Sin­ga­pore Sports School coach said: “I think a lot of women from my time chose to set­tle down early and take care of the fam­ily, and so never took the step to go into coach­ing.”</p>
    <p>Oh com­peted as an ath­lete un­til she was 26 – when she got mar­ried</p>
    <p>– and started coach­ing, as a vol­un­teer at first, when her two daugh­ters were about 10 and showed an in­ter­est in com­pet­ing in track and field.</p>
    <p>This mind­set is not as preva­lent in to­day’s gen­er­a­tion, Khng be­lieves, “be­cause of the in­creased exposure to suc­cesses of fe­male ath­letes and coaches” through plat­forms like so­cial me­dia or even Net­flix doc­u­men­taries.</p>
    <p>AD­DRESS­ING THE DIS­PAR­ITY</p>
    <p>Azhar Yu­sof, head of CoachSG, said it is ac­tively try­ing to ad­dress the dis­par­ity in num­bers by build­ing and cre­at­ing aware­ness about the de­vel­op­ment path­ways for women who take up coach­ing.</p>
    <p>To that end, CoachSG will be launch­ing an on­line learn­ing plat­form known as SportSG Ed­u­ca­tion & De­vel­op­ment, which will en­able coaches to adopt con­tem­po­rary ap­proaches to coach­ing ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Azhar added that CoachSG has part­nered the In­ter­na­tional Coun­cil of Coach­ing Ex­cel­lence (ICCE) to in­tro­duce the Coach De­vel­oper pro­gramme – which aims to im­prove coach­ing pro­grammes, sup­port and men­tor­ship – here. There are presently three ICCE qual­i­fied train­ers and 46 ICCE-trained coach de­vel­op­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“There has also been a de­lib­er­ate ef­fort to en­sure the de­vel­op­ment of fe­male coach de­vel­op­ers to in­spire and at­tract more women to join the coach­ing pro­fes­sion,” he said. “This is be­cause we recog­nise the im­por­tance of fe­male role mod­els such as Ms Khng, to serve as in­spi­ra­tion and push for­ward the nar­ra­tive of suc­cess­ful women i n coach­ing.”</p>
    <p>Feed­ing this nar­ra­tive, said Wang, is a big step for­ward as ac­ces­si­bil­ity for women coaches is not an is­sue, but “vis­i­bil­ity” still is.</p>
    <p>None of the fe­male coaches The Straits Times spoke to said their gen­der had ever been an is­sue through­out their coach­ing jour­ney, although Wang said: “Some­times, women may feel in­tim­i­dated i n an all-male coach­ing course or en­vi­ron­ment. By and large, though, for me it was fine and this was just in the be­gin­ning where I was out of my com­fort zone, and this may be true for a lot of girls out there too.”</p>
    <p>PAY­ING IT FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>With Khng’s win rais­ing the pro­file of fe­male coaches, what is im­por­tant now, added Wang, is to keep pay­ing it for­ward.</p>
    <p>“While Louise’s and my own sto­ries are great, I also feel the re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­sure that while we may be ‘firsts’ through some doors, we’re also not the last so men­tor­ing young fe­male coaches is one of the things I do now with my club, Blacks Rugby FC,” said Wang.</p>
    <p>“Not all of them may as­pire to be elite coaches, but coach­ing is more than win­ning, it is about per­sonal growth.”</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old, also a coach ed­u­ca­tor with World Rugby, said there have been pro­gres­sive steps taken by world gov­ern­ing bod­ies for var­i­ous sports, in­clud­ing rugby.</p>
    <p>As part of World Rugby’s Gen­der In­clu­sion Ini­tia­tive, only fe­male coaches re­ceived a dis­count on a Level 1 Coach­ing Course con­ducted in Sin­ga­pore in 2018, and 25 women signed up as par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Khng’s wish is that her win will pave the way for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of fe­male coaches, who can be as­sured that their ef­forts will also be recog­nised.</p>
    <p>“I hope that it would in­spire other coaches to put in heart into their hard work and to keep pur­su­ing their goals and pas­sion…</p>
    <p>“They should not be con­cerned about bar­ri­ers as the glass ceil­ing has been bro­ken, and women are slowly tak­ing up leadership and men­tor­ing roles in the fields of pol­i­tics, busi­ness and now sport.”</p>
