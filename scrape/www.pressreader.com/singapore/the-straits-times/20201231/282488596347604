    <p>•</p>
    <p>HONG KONG In a Hong Kong trans­formed by China’s crack­down on every­thing from po­lit­i­cal dis­sent to the me­dia to the ju­di­ciary, pick­ing a new top boss for the stock ex­change is prov­ing to be dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Mr Charles Li announced his in­ten­tion to quit as head of Hong Kong Ex­changes and Clear­ing (HKEX) more than a year be­fore his con­tract ended amid strained re­la­tions with chair­man Laura Cha, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple familiar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Ms Cha was put off by his free­wheel­ing style, which led him to some­times not in­form the board of im­por­tant is­sues at an early stage, said the sources, who asked not to be iden­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>More than seven months later, with Mr Li for­mally step­ping down to­day, a com­mit­tee has yet to set­tle on a per­ma­nent re­place­ment. It is split be­tween pri­ori­tis­ing a can­di­date who can op­er­ate with con­fi­dence in China and one with a strong in­ter­na­tional back­ground, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Ms Cha, who is well con­nected in China and close to Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, sees the bourse’s role as serv­ing Bei­jing’s in­ter­ests and avoid­ing com­pe­ti­tion with the main­land’s ex­changes, one of the sources said.</p>
    <p>Mr Li had seemed to thread the nee­dle, cred­ited with both in­ter­na­tion­al­is­ing the ex­change as well as build­ing a bridge to China’s mar­kets. Still, the for­mer JPMor­gan Chase & Co banker was even­tu­ally seen as too out­spo­ken and his ag­gres­sive – and failed – £29.6 bil­lion (S$53 bil­lion) bid for the Lon­don Stock Ex­change (LSE) dented his stand­ing.</p>
    <p>He was forced to apol­o­gise last year after say­ing civil un­rest in Hong Kong had ex­posed faults un­der­ly­ing the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” frame­work of the ter­ri­tory’s re­turn to Chi­nese rule. He said he had been mis­in­ter­preted.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Bloomberg this month, Mr Li said the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer’s job is all about “steer­ing con­flict” both in Hong Kong and on the main­land, but also one that en­tails tak­ing risks.</p>
    <p>His suc­ces­sor at the city’s flag­ship fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion will need to con­tend with an in­creas­ingly as­sertive Bei­jing while up­hold­ing the con­fi­dence of global in­vestors at a time when Hong Kong’s sta­tus as an in­ter­na­tional hub is in doubt.</p>
    <p>The next boss will also need to con­sider whether to match Mr Li’s style as de facto spokesman for the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try or take a more sub­dued ap­proach, l eav­ing the city’s most im­por­tant sec­tor with­out a cheer­leader-in-chief.</p>
    <p>Can­di­dates be­ing con­sid­ered in­clude Mr Liu Che-Ning, co-head of Asia-Pa­cific bank­ing at HSBC Hold­ings, as well as the HKEX’s in­terim CEO and chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Calvin Tai.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Machin, CEO of Canada Pen­sion Plan In­vest­ment Board, and Mr Philip Zhai, a for­mer JPMor­gan Chase & Co banker, have also been dis­cussed, as has Mr Wil­fred Yiu, a for­mer Goldman Sachs Group banker who joined the ex­change as head of mar­kets last year, the sources said.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu, Mr Machin, Mr Zhai and Mr Yiu all de­clined to com­ment, while Mr Tai was not im­me­di­ately avail­able. Mr Machin and Mr Zhai re­main com­mit­ted to their cur­rent jobs, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>An HKEX spokesman said in an e-mail re­ply that the se­lec­tion process is be­ing con­ducted by the board with “clear com­mu­ni­ca­tion and trans­parency” and fur­ther an­nounce­ments will be made when the process con­cludes. It de­clined to com­ment on any “gos­sip or spec­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>Dubbed “Mr China” for link­ing the bourse closer to the main­land and help­ing open doors for for­eign in­vestors, Mr Li is a tough act to fol­low. The ex­change’s rev­enue has dou­bled dur­ing his ten­ure and its stock has surged ahead of the broader mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Li is pub­licly cred­ited for the land­mark deal con­nect­ing trad­ing be­tween Hong Kong and the ex­changes of Shang­hai and Shen­zhen. He likes to tell the story of how he sketched out the link on a nap­kin dur­ing lunch with the head of the Shang­hai Stock Ex­change.</p>
    <p>The Stock Con­nect en­abled in­vestors to buy and sell on­shore Chi­nese stocks and bonds us­ing Hong Kong’s in­fra­struc­ture, which helped global in­dex providers to in­clude Chi­nese se­cu­ri­ties in their</p>
    <p>Mr Charles Li, dubbed</p>
    <p>“Mr China” for link­ing</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s bourse closer to the main­land and help­ing open doors for for­eign in­vestors, is deemed a tough act to fol­low. gauges, driv­ing hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars into the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ms Cha, a for­mer vice-chair­man of the China Se­cu­ri­ties Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion, thinks that Mr Li has been given too much credit for the agree­ment, which now ac­counts for 10 per cent of the bourse’s rev­enue, said the sources.</p>
    <p>She has as­serted more control, putting in place checks and bal­ances for se­nior man­age­ment, ac­cord­ing to one of them.</p>
    <p>Mr Li’s res­ig­na­tion has shaken up the se­nior ranks at HKEX, with sev­eral ex­ec­u­tives ex­it­ing. Re­cent de­par­tures in­clude head of mar­ket de­vel­op­ment Li Gang and some in his team, which was re­spon­si­ble for de­vel­op­ing new prod­ucts, said the sources. Gen­eral coun­sel Fer­heen Ma­homed and head of hu­man re­sources Eva Chau have also left.</p>
    <p>Mr Li’s ma­jor set­back was the failed at­tempt to take over the LSE last year, fol­low­ing its ac­qui­si­tion of the Lon­don Metal Ex­change in 2012. That debacle dented ap­petite for mak­ing the bourse more of a global in­sti­tu­tion, which was one of the four tar­gets he set for his ten­ure, a source said.</p>
    <p>That has tied the HKEX more closely to China, with its suc­cess in draw­ing list­ings of ma­jor Chi­nese com­pa­nies this year be­com­ing one of the few bright spots for a city roiled by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and a crack­down fol­low­ing the im­po­si­tion by Bei­jing of a new na­tional se­cu­rity law. Hong Kong is suf­fer­ing through a deep re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Av­er­age stock trad­ing vol­umes rose 51 per cent in the first nine months of the year, while to­tal raised eq­uity funds, in both ini­tial public of­fer­ings and se­condary list­ings, more than dou­bled. Daily trad­ing through the bourse’s link to Chi­nese ex­changes hit records in the year un­til Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Tight­en­ing links fur­ther with the main­land is now the “ir­re­versible” path for the bourse, Mr Li said in the in­ter­view this month.</p>
    <p>The next steps could be to al­low Chi­nese in­vestors to buy bonds on the bourse, as well as open­ing up to de­riv­a­tives and the pri­mary stock mar­ket, he said.</p>
    <p>Even so, the push to­wards the main­land is not en­tirely wel­come in China, in part be­cause it wants to pro­mote its bourses. Ex­pand­ing the link to in­clude sev­eral bench­mark stocks has proved dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>For now, Ms Cha views Mr Tai, the in­terim CEO, as a safe pair of hands due to his fa­mil­iar­ity with the op­er­a­tions and in­fra­struc­ture, ac­cord­ing to the sources. But the 58-year-old could be ap­proach­ing re­tire­ment age.</p>
    <p>Mr Li offered some thoughts on what it takes as he heads out the door. One needs to be “strate­gi­cally ab­so­lutely con­fi­dent, but tech­ni­cally be hum­ble”, he said.</p>
    <p>There is a kind of “dif­fer­ent op­er­at­ing logic” in China, he said. “In terms of peo­ple re­la­tions... cer­tain things can be done eas­ier if the re­la­tion­ship is stronger.”</p>
