    <p>Lead­ing up to this month’s gen­eral elec­tion, one is­sue that won trac­tion was that of the large pres­ence here of for­eign work­ers, par­tic­u­larly the PMETs (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians) – who are thought to com­pete with lo­cals for jobs.</p>
    <p>Last week’s re­trench­ments at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa – and re­ports that Ma­rina Bay Sands will likely fol­low suit – have added grist to that mill. An easy tar­get of sus­pi­cion are the two dozen or so free trade agree­ments (FTAs) that Sin­ga­pore has signed, par­tic­u­larly ones where ser­vices trade have been ex­plic­itly writ­ten into the deals, such as with In­dia and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>As with mil­lions around the world caught in this pan­demic-ac­cen­tu­ated eco­nomic crunch, Sin­ga­pore­ans are ask­ing: What will be­come of me? Are the deals we agreed on to widen mar­ket ac­cess hurt­ing my job prospects?</p>
    <p>It is a valid fear and one that needs to be ad­dressed with facts, bal­anced rea­son­ing and, above all, em­pa­thy. But to get there, you need to know why Sin­ga­pore pur­sued FTAs in the first place and why they re­main per­haps even more rel­e­vant to­day, when the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem sup­ported by the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) is semi-paral­ysed and stressed by the in­sur­gent be­hav­iour of the United States.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 1996, when Sin­ga­pore hosted the in­au­gu­ral Min­is­te­rial Con­fer­ence of the</p>
    <p>WTO, the air was one of op­ti­mism about the fu­ture of free trade and glob­al­i­sa­tion. World mer­chan­dise trade had grown 10 per cent per an­num from a mere US$50 bil­lion in 1947 to US$5.6 tril­lion in 1995.</p>
    <p>As bar­ri­ers to the free flow of trade and in­vest­ments con­tin­ued to fall, the ex­pec­ta­tion was that coun­tries could cap­i­talise more fully on their com­par­a­tive strengths and look be­yond na­tional and re­gional fron­tiers.</p>
    <p>Open­ing the trade sum­mit, then Prime Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong spoke of stand­ing at the thresh­old of a golden age of global eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Three years later, when trade min­is­ters con­vened in Seat­tle for their third sum­mit, the mood had dark­ened. In­deed, the Seat­tle con­fer­ence failed to make progress on the next round of trade ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>It was against this back­ground of stalling trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion and a shift from goods to­wards ser­vices trade that Sin­ga­pore and like-minded na­tions thought of FTAs as a use­ful way to keep trade ex­pand­ing, while they waited for the rest of the world to catch up.</p>
    <p>That led to the Agree­ment be­tween New Zealand and Sin­ga­pore on a Closer Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (ANZSCEP), Sin­ga­pore’s first bi­lat­eral FTA.</p>
    <p>Its mer­its came into view in­stantly; af­ter the FTA was im­ple­mented on Jan 1, 2001, Sin­ga­pore’s ex­ports to New</p>
    <p>Zealand rose 54 per cent on-year in Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary. To­day, there are 25 bi­lat­eral and pluri­lat­eral FTAs in­volv­ing Sin­ga­pore and more are un­der ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry Of Trade and In­dus­try es­ti­mates that in 2018, FTAs helped Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies ben­e­fit from about $1.2 bil­lion in tar­iff con­ces­sions when sell­ing to over­seas mar­kets and widened its ser­vices sec­tor’s mar­ket ac­cess op­por­tu­ni­ties in a range of sec­tors in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices, ed­u­ca­tion ser­vices, health, lo­gis­tics and trans­port ser­vices, in the process cre­at­ing good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans. They also pro­vide a cush­ion against the va­garies of geopol­i­tics that in­creas­ingly im­pact trade, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s food security.</p>
    <p>For all its re­liance on FTAs as a strat­egy, each of them, in­clud­ing the Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment (Ceca) with In­dia that has drawn the most noise lately, has to be a care­ful judg­ment call.</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore went for Ceca, it was be­cause it could not wait for WTO to fin­ish its work to gain en­try into the promis­ing In­dian mar­ket. Tor­tu­ously ne­go­ti­ated over two years, the nearly 740-page doc­u­ment was agreed on af­ter vexed ne­go­ti­a­tions over the finer de­tails of a fi­nan­cial ser­vices and dou­ble tax­a­tion avoid­ance agree­ment by which Sin­ga­pore-regis­tered com­pa­nies en­joyed zero cap­i­tal gains in In­dia. To the last, sec­tions of In­dian in­dus­try and some po­lit­i­cal par­ties were scep­ti­cal of its ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>To­day, there is no deny­ing that both sides gained. If you look past visu­als of the large num­ber of In­dian faces at lunchtime in ar­eas like Ma­rina Bay Fi­nan­cial Cen­tre and the IT-con­cen­trated Changi Busi­ness Park, Ceca has de­liv­ered for Sin­ga­pore. Of­fi­cial data on Statlink shows bi­lat­eral trade rose from $16.6 bil­lion in 2005 to $24.3 bil­lion last year. Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies’ in­vest­ments in In­dia, a mere $1.3 bil­lion in 2005, rose to $60.9 bil­lion by the end of 2018.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure ex­pands if you in­clude global com­pa­nies rout­ing their for­eign di­rect in­vest­ments through Sin­ga­pore. Con­fed­er­a­tion of In­dian In­dus­try – In­dia Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion, a group­ing of big</p>
    <p>In­dian com­pa­nies here, says cu­mu­la­tive FDI routed from Sin­ga­pore into In­dia from April 2000 to Septem­ber 2019 amounts to US$91.02 bil­lion, or a fifth of to­tal in­flows into In­dia. What’s more, it notes, more than 80 per cent of listed off­shore bonds by In­dian is­suers are listed on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change and Sin­ga­pore-based in­vestors have as­sets un­der man­age­ment in In­dia val­ued in ex­cess of $100 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ceca also helped pave the way for Sin­ga­pore to prise open a sec­tor that govern­ments tend to ob­ses­sively pro­tect: bank­ing.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank, whose at­tempt to ex­pand in some big Asean mar­kets has been thwarted, op­er­ates 34 branches across 24 In­dian ci­ties, a foot­print among for­eign banks that ranks only be­hind Stan­dard Char­tered and Citi, which have op­er­ated there from 1858 and 1902, re­spec­tively. In the In­dian fi­nan­cial year that ended in March, DBS’ net In­dia rev­enue rose 24 per cent to 14.44 bil­lion ru­pees ($272.3 mil­lion) while net profit rose more than six­fold.</p>
    <p>Much of the Sin­ga­porean mis­giv­ings about Ceca stem from its list­ing of 127 pro­fes­sions un­der the Tem­po­rary Move­ment of Nat­u­ral Per­sons chap­ter. Two other FTAs – with Ja­pan and the US – also in­clude com­mit­ments on pro­fes­sion­als. While Ceca has the long­est list, it has the short­est du­ra­tion – just a year – com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, this has raised fears of a flood of In­dian pro­fes­sion­als ar­riv­ing to steal well-pay­ing jobs at a time when PMETs, at 58 per cent, de­ci­sively dom­i­nate the lo­cal job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>How­ever, tem­po­rary move­ment of nat­u­ral per­sons is not un­usual in trade agree­ments and also fig­ure in the other FTAs Sin­ga­pore signed, for in­stance, with Aus­tralia and New Zealand. None of them con­fer un­fet­tered right of en­try for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>I was in the room in June 2005 when Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and his then coun­ter­part, Dr</p>
    <p>Man­mo­han Singh, signed Ceca and at the press in­ter­ac­tions that fol­lowed, se­nior Sin­ga­pore of­fi­cials con­sis­tently made clear that whether it was ac­cess to Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial ser­vices mar­ket or in pro­fes­sional ser­vices, any­thing agreed would be “sub­ject to lo­cal Sin­ga­porean reg­u­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>In fact, this was in­deed the first line of a multi-lay­ered range of safe­guards built to pre­vent an in­flux, as I re­alised sub­se­quently. For in­stance, there are more than 540 med­i­cal col­leges recog­nised by the In­dian Med­i­cal Council. Yet, as of Jan 1, Sin­ga­pore recog­nises de­grees from a mere two of these in­sti­tu­tions, and that’s down from seven ear­lier. Be­sides, the In­dian doc­tors who find jobs here have to get lo­cal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion as well.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, where in­tra-com­pany trans­fers are in­volved – a for­eign line man­ager who might seek to pull in a loyal un­der­ling, for in­stance – the scru­tiny lev­els have tight­ened be­fore an Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) is granted.</p>
    <p>An­other thresh­old, and one which draws a lot of com­plaints, is a min­i­mum salary re­quire­ment for for­eign­ers in var­i­ous cat­e­gories, usu­ally set above the me­dian to pre­vent un­der­cut­ting of lo­cal salaries.</p>
    <p>One route avail­able for Sin­ga­pore­ans to ad­dress spe­cific griev­ances is the Fair</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF), which is meant to pro­tect against dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>FCF re­quires com­pa­nies to ad­ver­tise pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial and ex­ec­u­tive posts for at least 14 days be­fore the firms can ap­ply to the Min­istry of Man­power for an EP for a for­eigner. As of March, there were some 1,000 com­pa­nies that had been placed on the FCF watch list, in­clud­ing those with an ex­cep­tion­ally high share of PMETs com­pared with their in­dus­try peers, or high con­cen­tra­tion of sin­gle na­tion­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The thresh­old for monthly salaries ex­empted from FCF advertisin­g re­quire­ments has also steadily in­creased over the years and now stands at $20,000. In Jan­uary, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo an­nounced sev­eral up­dates to give more teeth to the FCF.</p>
    <p>The bet­ter com­pa­nies, whether they are the global banks or In­dian con­glom­er­ates, re­alise they need to do their part and in­deed have moved to do so.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s US$113 bil­lion Tata group, for in­stance, has 20 op­er­at­ing com­pa­nies and 28 en­ti­ties in Sin­ga­pore, em­ploy­ing a to­tal of 3,300 staff. At its flag­ship Tata Con­sul­tancy Ser­vices, its soft­ware ser­vices arm, the per­cent­age of lo­cal res­i­dents em­ployed has dou­bled to nearly 40 per cent over the past five years, says Mr K.V.</p>
    <p>Rao, res­i­dent di­rec­tor of Tata Sons, the hold­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>Of the 1,500 TCS em­ploy­ees on the is­land, many serve re­gional func­tions. They in­clude head of tele­coms for Asia-Pa­cific Jimmy Tan, hu­man re­sources head for Sin­ga­pore and South Korea Seow Li Dwen Hwee and the mar­ket­ing head for Sin­ga­pore, South Korea and Tai­wan Lee Shu Shan.</p>
    <p>TCS Asia-Pa­cific pres­i­dent Girish Ra­machan­dran says he would hire more Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­cept that many lo­cals seek to be project man­agers and an­a­lysts “from Day 2” rather than work their way up. Be­sides, he says, many of TCS’ big clients on the is­land are still on main­frames whereas the young do not like to work on old tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>For sure, all FTAs, Ceca in­cluded, are al­ways a bal­ance of in­ter­ests and sub­ject to pe­ri­odic re­view. But rene­go­ti­a­tion can­not be with­out costs and who knows the re­cip­ro­cal ac­tion may even ad­versely im­pact the 40 per cent of the job mar­ket that do not come into the PMET pool but do ben­e­fit from the good that FTAs bring. Over the two decades past, the FTAs we have signed cover economies that rep­re­sent more than 85 per cent of global GDP and ac­count for more than 90 per cent of its trade.</p>
    <p>There is also the ques­tion of whether Sin­ga­pore pro­duces enough of its own to serve the econ­omy’s ex­pand­ing needs; last year alone, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board at­tracted in­vest­ment com­mit­ments of $15.2 bil­lion in fixed as­set in­vest­ments and a pro­jected $9 bil­lion in to­tal busi­ness ex­pen­di­ture per an­num as com­pa­nies spend on bank­ing, travel and le­gal is­sues. When the projects are fully im­ple­mented, they will cre­ate nearly 33,000 jobs.</p>
    <p>This is­sue of for­eign­ers com­pet­ing for PMET jobs will not go away. In­deed, the next pe­ri­odic jobs re­port will surely bring it into fo­cus again as re­trench­ments pro­ceed. But if ever there was a time for cool minds and a long view, it is now.</p>
