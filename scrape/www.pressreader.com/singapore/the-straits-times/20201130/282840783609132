    <p>A WOK OR A MU­SI­CAL IN­STRU­MENT?:</p>
    <p>Ni­cholas Tse sings, acts and is a celebrity chef, but his lat­est role seems to be that of Ninja Tur­tle.</p>
    <p>Late last Fri­day, the Hong</p>
    <p>Kong celebrity posted on Weibo two photos of him­self car­ry­ing the Hang per­cus­sion in­stru­ment on his back in what was likely a ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor, who has won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Ac­tor for his per­for­mance in the film The Stool Pi­geon (2010), al­luded to the in­stru­ment look­ing like a wok when he wrote:</p>
    <p>“The big chef car­ry­ing a wok in Teenage Mu­tant Ninja Tur­tles.”</p>
    <p>His fol­low­ers had a field day crack­ing jokes, as some quipped that he was car­ry­ing a black pot on his back, re­fer­ring to the Chi­nese id­iom which means tak­ing the blame for some­one.</p>
    <p>Some asked if the star, re­ferred to as Chef Nic in his food trav­el­ogue shows, would be us­ing the “wok” to cook, while oth­ers asked if he would cook and sing at the same time.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Hong Kong me­dia, Tse, who is one of the men­tors on re­al­ity singing show Sing! China 2020, has per­formed us­ing the Hang on the show.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor will be ap­pear­ing in the new movie Rag­ing Fire, which was di­rected by the late di­rec­tor Benny Chan. The po­lice drama also stars Don­nie Yen, Qin Lan and Ray Lui.</p>
    <p>Tse, who is cur­rently dat­ing pop diva Faye Wong, is the for­mer hus­band of Hong Kong ac­tress Ce­cilia Che­ung, with whom he has two sons.</p>
