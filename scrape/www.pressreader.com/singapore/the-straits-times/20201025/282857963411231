    <p>When Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping gave a speech on Oct 14 to mark the 40th an­niver­sary of the Shen­zhen Special Eco­nomic Zone (SEZ), he chose to do it in the Qian­hai dis­trict, a rel­a­tively new area po­si­tion­ing it­self as a hub for cross-bor­der ser­vices with Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Just over two hours’ drive away, and across the es­tu­ary where the Pearl River emp­ties into the sea, is the is­land of Hengqin. Much like Qian­hai, it lies close to an es­tab­lished eco­nomic zone (Zhuhai, in this case) and also po­si­tions it­self as a hub for co­op­er­a­tion and trade with Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther up north in Shang­hai is the Lin­gang Special Area, which fo­cuses on high-tech devel­op­ment and cross-bor­der projects with in­cen­tives for for­eign in­vestors.</p>
    <p>In the four decades since Chi­nese leader Deng Xiaop­ing first des­ig­nated four cities in south­ern China as SEZs – Shan­tou, Shen­zhen, Xi­a­men and Zhuhai – sim­i­lar eco­nomic devel­op­ment zones (EDZs) tar­geted at at­tract­ing for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment have mush­roomed across the coun­try, in­clud­ing smaller zones within a zone, like Qian­hai, Hengqin and Lin­gang.</p>
    <p>With more than 2,000 such ar­eas of vary­ing sizes across the coun­try – split into at least 15 dif­fer­ent cat­e­gories at the na­tional level alone, with more at pro­vin­cial and mu­nic­i­pal lev­els – China has by far more special zones for eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity than any other coun­try, mak­ing up half of the world’s to­tal.</p>
    <p>While these are all in line with the coun­try’s aim of open­ing up the econ­omy to in­ter­na­tional trade, crit­ics say the pro­lif­er­a­tion of such zones has lim­ited the suc­cess of newer ones.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem: A lack of an es­tab­lished ecosys­tem and too many sim­i­lar ar­eas fight­ing for a slice of the same pie.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, the coun­try has built more eco­nomic zones in the less af­flu­ent cen­tral and western prov­inces – trad­ing ar­eas where goods are not sub­jected to Cus­toms du­ties or taxes, and where firms get tax breaks and even pref­er­en­tial res­i­den­tial poli­cies to at­tract tal­ent.</p>
    <p>This was ramped up in the last two years in a bid to make un­der­de­vel­oped ar­eas more at­trac­tive to high-qual­ity man­u­fac­tur­ers, to boost the lo­cal econ­omy and help weather trade ten­sions with the United States.</p>
    <p>POL­ICY EX­PER­I­MENTS</p>
    <p>In 1978, as China was look­ing at open­ing up to the world, there were con­cerns within the party leadership about go­ing from a planned econ­omy to a mar­ket-driven one.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral gov­ern­ment needed ar­eas where it could test out poli­cies it had lit­tle ex­pe­ri­ence in man­ag­ing. Some of these ex­per­i­ments in ac­com­mo­dat­ing for­eign in­vestors and sell­ing land use rights were later rolled out na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Goods pro­duced in these early special eco­nomic zones were ex­port-ori­ented and the ar­eas al­lowed for­eign en­ti­ties to op­er­ate in China.</p>
    <p>The four cities, along with Hainan, were cho­sen be­cause of their prox­im­ity to ship­ping routes and Hong Kong, Ma­cau and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>In 1990, the gov­ern­ment started set­ting up eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal devel­op­ment zones, like Shang­hai’s Pudong New Area, which were in 2013 ex­panded to in­clude free trade zones (FTZs). In such ar­eas, which are gen­er­ally smaller than SEZs, poli­cies tar­get cer­tain in­dus­tries like ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and civil avi­a­tion to fa­cil­i­tate the cre­ation of an in­dus­trial hub.</p>
    <p>By the 2000s, as coastal prov­inces grew af­flu­ent, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment also shifted its fo­cus in­wards and to the western re­gions, re­sult­ing in the des­ig­na­tion of Kash­gar and Khor­gos in Xin­jiang as SEZs.</p>
    <p>They were meant to repli­cate the model that had been es­tab­lished in the coastal eco­nomic devel­op­ment ar­eas – where for­eign firms could eas­ily tap busi­ness-friendly poli­cies and in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Each ge­o­graph­i­cal zone would also have a special area of fo­cus, and the eco­nomic growth was in­tended to ben­e­fit the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Yet, some, like the Khor­gos Gate­way, strug­gle to meet their full po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated on the bor­der of China and Kaza­khstan, the Khor­gos Gate­way dry port and SEZ were meant to be a cor­ner­stone of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, an am­bi­tious in­fra­struc­ture project. The dry port al­lows trains to carry goods be­tween</p>
    <p>China and Europe in just about two weeks, shav­ing sev­eral weeks off con­tainer ship­ping and cut­ting the cost of air freight.</p>
    <p>But the 180,000 TEU (twen­ty­foot equiv­a­lent unit) of goods that go through Khor­gos an­nu­ally is a frac­tion of the mil­lions of con­tain­ers that con­tinue to go be­tween China and Europe via sea freight.</p>
    <p>It is also pro­hib­i­tively ex­pen­sive: Ac­cord­ing to the Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace, a think-tank head­quar­tered in Washington, rail freight from China to Europe via Cen­tral Asia is not eco­nom­i­cally vi­able with­out up to 40 per cent sub­si­dies from the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>There are other ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>MIXED SIG­NALS</p>
    <p>When Lin­gang was last year added to Shang­hai’s ex­panded pi­lot free trade zone, there were plans for the area to fa­cil­i­tate freer ac­tiv­i­ties in trade and in­vest­ment, along­side plans to turn the area into an au­to­mo­tive hub com­ple­ment­ing Tesla’s US$2 bil­lion (S$2.71 bil­lion) fac­tory that opened in 2018.</p>
    <p>This meant that there would be pref­er­en­tial tax poli­cies, such as a re­duced rate of 15 per cent on cor­po­rate in­come tax, and im­port duty ex­emp­tions for high-tech firms. The gov­ern­ment had also promised to level the play­ing field in sev­eral key sec­tors like telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, and in­sur­ance and se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one can be a Tesla sup­plier, said an au­to­mo­tive ex­ec­u­tive whose firm was look­ing at ex­pand­ing in Lin­gang.</p>
    <p>“(Fur­ther­more) for the big­ger firms, they want to see more pol­icy in­cen­tives be­fore mov­ing in,” he said, ask­ing not to be named as he is not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>“When we were told about Lin­gang last year, they made it sound like it would be the new place to be, but from gov­ern­ment an­nounce­ments, it also looks like they’re di­rect­ing more re­sources to Hainan – which is send­ing us a lot of mixed sig­nals.”</p>
    <p>Months af­ter Lin­gang was an­nounced, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment de­clared the en­tire province of Hainan a free trade zone and free trade port ca­ter­ing to the do­mes­tic mar­ket.</p>
    <p>This means that un­like in most of the other eco­nomic zones where goods and ser­vices are geared to­wards the ex­port mar­ket, firms that set up shop in Hainan could have an ad­van­tage in ac­cess­ing China’s 1.4 bil­lion-strong mar­ket.</p>
    <p>And in­vest­ments in some ar­eas ap­pear to be slow­ing: Ac­cord­ing to Shang­hai gov­ern­ment data, for­eign in­vest­ment growth in its free trade zone fell 3.5 per cent to US$6.77 bil­lion in 2018, com­pared with a 13.5 per cent rise to US$7.02 bil­lion the pre­vi­ous year. Data from last year was not avail­able.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic zones have also been hard-pressed to repli­cate the suc­cess of the Shen­zhen SEZ.</p>
    <p>Shen­zhen’s trans­for­ma­tion from sleepy fish­ing vil­lage to tech and man­u­fac­tur­ing hub with nearly 20 per cent an­nual growth is oft held up as a suc­cess story and a case for eco­nomic devel­op­ment zones.</p>
    <p>The city’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct last year was nearly 2.7 tril­lion yuan (S$550 bil­lion), and its in­ter­na­tional trade ac­counts for some 2.8 bil­lion yuan, or about 10 per cent of the coun­try’s to­tal vol­ume.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a special re­port by the United Na­tions Con­fer­ence on Trade and Devel­op­ment, as at last year, China had 2,543 EDZs of vary­ing sizes and func­tions, with 13 still un­der devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­po­nents of such zones say the sheer va­ri­ety al­lows a more even spread of eco­nomic devel­op­ment across the coun­try, al­low­ing ar­eas to be opened to for­eign in­vest­ments while al­low­ing the op­por­tu­nity to ex­per­i­ment with var­i­ous poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“There are a va­ri­ety of dif­fer­ent names but es­sen­tially they all serve the same pur­pose: They are the only way that China’s (mar­ket) poli­cies can match those in the in­ter­na­tional arena,” said Dr Li Jinkui of the China Devel­op­ment In­sti­tute, a think-tank based in Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>“It’s a means for the lo­cal gov­ern­ments to open their own ar­eas to trade with the out­side world be­cause if not, some of our gov­ern­ment poli­cies are i ncom­pat­i­ble with those of in­ter­na­tional trad­ing norms.”</p>
    <p>While China this year i mple­mented a for­eign in­vest­ment law that al­lows for­eign firms to wholly own com­pa­nies across the coun­try, there are still lim­its on cap­i­tal con­trols and “neg­a­tive lists” of in­dus­tries for­eign­ers can­not en­ter.</p>
    <p>The lack of es­tab­lished ecosys­tems and clear growth tra­jec­to­ries has also held back firms from ex­pand­ing into newer ar­eas, said As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Gu Qingyang of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, in Sin­ga­pore, when they wanted to build a bio­med­i­cal hub, it wasn’t just about build­ing the labs and at­tract­ing top sci­en­tists. They needed to have a strong foun­da­tion,” he said, point­ing to the in­creased em­pha­sis on life sciences in schools while also hav­ing top phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms set up shop in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>But in the case of China, there has also been a fi­nite amount of tal­ent with in­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence that can bring value to such zones, as many choose to stay in the more es­tab­lished ar­eas.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Yun­nan FTZ, when it was set up, was in­tended to be a des­ti­na­tion for well­ness tourism, but devel­op­ment has been slug­gish – its role fa­cil­i­tat­ing trade with neigh­bour­ing Myan­mar, con­nected by a por­ous land bor­der, has been far more suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>“China is mov­ing from a state of high-quan­tity to high-qual­ity growth, (so) it’s about sur­vival of the fittest,” Prof Gu said.</p>
    <p>“Very few places can repli­cate the suc­cess of Shen­zhen and the en­tire Pearl River Delta, where there’s an es­tab­lished sup­ply chain. And tal­ented peo­ple don’t want to go some­where they don’t see a fu­ture.”</p>
