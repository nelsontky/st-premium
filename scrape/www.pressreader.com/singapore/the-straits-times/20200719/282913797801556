    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A It was around 2007 to 2008 when one of my in­vest­ment bankers sug­gested that I look into for­eign ex­change de­riv­a­tives. This was a new prod­uct I had not ear­lier in­vested in. He con­vinced me to take po­si­tions in some currencies and when the fi­nan­cial cri­sis hap­pened, they fluc­tu­ated neg­a­tively against my po­si­tion and I lost al­most about 40 per cent of the value of my port­fo­lio in less than three months. It was a big hit for me.</p>
    <p>Les­son learnt: Don’t try to be too ad­ven­tur­ous and in­vest in prod­ucts you do not un­der­stand. Re­turns that some­times look too good to be true, are too good to be true. Leave that to the ex­perts. Stick to in­vest­ment prod­ucts you know about be­cause preser­va­tion of wealth is more im­por­tant than look­ing at re­turns.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber that with ev­ery ab­nor­mal re­turn, you will carry ab­nor­mal risk.</p>
    <p>The same goes for cryp­tocur­rency – at the height of its pop­u­lar­ity, I made sure to stay away from it and I’m glad that I did. I be­lieve that prod­ucts which you do not un­der­stand and do not fol­low or study on a reg­u­lar ba­sis, you should not get ad­ven­tur­ous about and put money in be­cause you can get greedy. And when things turn tight, it leaves a void.</p>
    <p>To sum up, my in­vest­ments are about wealth preser­va­tion. Wealth cre­ation hap­pens through my busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A Of all the in­vest­ments I’ve made lo­cally, Validus re­mains one of my largest in­vest­ments in Sin­ga­pore and my best one to date. Small and medium-sized en­ter­prises are a key contributo­r to any econ­omy, con­tribut­ing mas­sively to its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct while pro­vid­ing sta­ble em­ploy­ment to the work­force.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Validus, it would have to be the de­ci­sions I’ve made for my prop­erty busi­ness. Be­tween 2002 and 2004, when the mid­dle class in In­dia was ris­ing, I re­alised that buy­ing land or real es­tate in In­dia – espe­cially agri­cul­tural or in­dus­trial land – by go­ing into the fringes of the ur­ban ar­eas, seemed to be a wise choice.</p>
    <p>I al­lo­cated some in­vest­ments to buy­ing these lands. I chose not to take any loans be­cause I knew I wanted to hold on to them for at least 10 years. They will not give me any kind of rental yields and I would have to ser­vice those loans.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward 10 years later, ev­ery dol­lar that I in­vested made a 2,000 per cent re­turn over that pe­riod.</p>
