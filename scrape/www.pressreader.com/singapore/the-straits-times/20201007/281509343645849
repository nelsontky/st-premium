    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong took the stand in the High Court yes­ter­day at the start of a four-day hear­ing in his defama­tion suit against blog­ger Leong Sze Hian.</p>
    <p>PM Lee is su­ing Mr Leong over a post the blog­ger and fi­nan­cial ad­viser shared on his Face­book page in 2018, which con­tained a link to an ar­ti­cle by a Malaysian news site.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle al­leged that for­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak had signed “se­cret deals” with PM Lee in ex­change for help from Sin­ga­pore banks in laun­der­ing money from scan­dal-rid­den state fund 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had.</p>
    <p>PM Lee’s lawyer, Senior Coun­sel Davin­der Singh, said in his open­ing state­ment that Mr Leong con­tin­ued to in­sist the ar­ti­cle falsely link­ing PM Lee to the 1MDB scan­dal in Malaysia was true, even af­ter he had re­moved the Face­book post that linked to it.</p>
    <p>At the hear­ing, Mr Leong’s lawyer Lim Tean con­tended that PM Lee had no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion to take le­gal ac­tion against his client, and ar­gued he had picked on Mr Leong be­cause he is a staunch gov­ern­ment critic.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he had a re­spon­si­bil­ity to vin­di­cate his rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>To­day, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tuan Quang Phan of Hong Kong Univer­sity Business School, a so­cial me­dia aca­demic, will give ev­i­dence via video link as an ex­pert wit­ness for PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Tean (ad­dress­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong): Would you not have ob­tained bet­ter reme­dies and a bet­ter vin­di­ca­tion of your rep­u­ta­tion if you had sued the orig­i­na­tor of that ar­ti­cle in­stead of one of the thou­sands who shared it?</p>
    <p>PM: That is for me and my le­gal coun­sel to de­cide.</p>
    <p>Justice Aedit Ab­dul­lah:</p>
    <p>All right. That’s his an­swer, Mr Lim. I’ve al­lowed you to pur­sue this line but you keep run­ning up against the same point. So you have to move on.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim: I am putting it to you, Mr Lee, that these pro­ceed­ings don’t serve to vin­di­cate your rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>PM: I dis­agree. If I didn’t think they would, I wouldn’t have com­menced them.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim: And I am putting it to you that there was no proper need to pur­sue these pro­ceed­ings since you could have and you did ob­tain a more valu­able rem­edy through gov­ern­ment ac­tion.</p>
