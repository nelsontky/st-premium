    <p>I lived in Ger­many for three years in the early 2000s, cold call­ing se­nior lead­ers of Ger­man multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions about in­vest­ing in Sin­ga­pore to ac­cel­er­ate their Asian ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>I had great suc­cess be­cause many clients viewed Sin­ga­pore as the Ger­many of Asia, with a dis­ci­plined and rule-based pop­u­la­tion, and where man­u­fac­tur­ing is a key pil­lar of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>To get a sense of how com­fort­able Ger­mans are with Sin­ga­pore, in a speech given by then Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try (In­dus­try) S. Iswaran at the Han­nover Fair in 2018, he pointed out that Sin­ga­pore was Ger­many’s largest trad­ing part­ner in Asean, and there were 1,700 Ger­man com­pa­nies based in Sin­ga­pore, an al­most 60 per cent in­crease over the decade be­fore.</p>
    <p>Given my time in Ger­many, I read with great interest John Kampfner’s re­cent best­seller, Why The Ger­mans Do It Bet­ter. He de­scribes the resilience of the Ger­mans de­spite their dif­fi­cult his­tory, a de­pen­dence on man­u­fac­tur­ing, and how all this has come to­gether in their re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The book traces how the Ger­mans have con­fronted their trou­bled past with the Holo­caust, em­braced the fall of the Berlin Wall, and be­came a uni­fied coun­try.</p>
    <p>Kampfner writes: “Ger­mans can­not bring them­selves to praise their coun­try. This re­fusal to see good is hard­wired.” This per­sis­tent self-ques­tion­ing is rooted in their dif­fi­cult past, but the trait keeps the coun­try on its toes, and is part of its se­cret for resilience and suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, too, has had a dif­fi­cult past. The Ja­panese oc­cu­pa­tion, the sep­a­ra­tion from Malaysia, and the de­par­ture of the Bri­tish troops from Sin­ga­pore have all helped to shape the coun­try into what it is to­day.</p>
    <p>Is it any won­der that the con­cept of be­ing “ki­asu”, or the fear of los­ing out, is part of the na­tional lex­i­con? A Los An­ge­les Times ar­ti­cle in 2019 de­scribed this uniquely Sin­ga­porean trait as a</p>
    <p>“sur­vival in­stinct” that stems from a “deep-rooted in­se­cu­rity as a blip on the map”.</p>
    <p>Kampfner says the Ger­man econ­omy’s resilience is due to its de­pen­dence on man­u­fac­tur­ing – build­ing a strong engi­neer­ing base, un­der­pinned by an “em­pha­sis on ed­u­ca­tion, ap­pren­tice­ships, and other in-work train­ing”.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic mir­a­cle of Ger­many was not a fore­gone con­clu­sion af­ter World War II, which left the coun­try in sham­bles. Post-war eco­nomic re­forms, boosted by the Amer­i­can aid pro­gramme, the Mar­shall Plan, led to the re­build­ing of the coun­try’s econ­omy. By 1968, just two decades af­ter the end of the war, West Ger­many’s econ­omy was larger than the United King­dom’s.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, af­ter the an­nounce­ment of the Bri­tish troop de­par­ture in 1967, the coun­try had to re­build its lo­cal econ­omy by</p>
    <p>at­tract­ing labour-in­ten­sive man­u­fac­tur­ing. At the time, the Bri­tish pres­ence ac­counted for an estimated 20 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross na­tional prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Its de­ci­sion to im­ple­ment na­tional eco­nomic strate­gies to pro­mote the coun­try’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor cre­ated jobs and wealth. Sin­ga­pore’s per capita gross do­mes­tic prod­uct rose from be­low US$10,000 at in­de­pen­dence to more than US$40,000 in 2000. Its job cre­ation strate­gies were so suc­cess­ful that by the time the last Bri­tish troops left in 1976, Sin­ga­pore had achieved al­most full em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, since Covid-19 struck last year, its resilience has been bur­nished by its pan­demic re­sponse. While it was hard hit by the global lock­downs and the knock-on im­pact on man­u­fac­tur­ing con­sump­tion, the Ger­man govern­ment sought to save as many</p>
    <p>busi­nesses as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Kampfner writes: “Ger­many has an in­sur­ance pol­icy that oth­ers do not pos­sess. Years of the Black Zero, the aus­ter­ity re­quire­ment that the fed­eral govern­ment and re­gions must balance their books, left the ex­che­quer with a huge sur­plus.” This al­lowed the govern­ment to un­leash a Covid-19 stim­u­lus pack­age equiv­a­lent to a whop­ping 40 per cent of its econ­omy – the high­est in the world.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic resilience of the coun­try is ev­i­denced by the steep re­bounds in man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put and in­vestor con­fi­dence in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Given its prior in­vest­ment in re­search and ed­u­ca­tion, it is no co­in­ci­dence that Ger­many is home to BioNtech, the com­pany that pro­vided phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer with the first Covid-19 vac­cine ap­proved in the Western world and that is now widely dis­trib­uted around the world, with health­care work­ers in Sin­ga­pore get­ting the ini­tial doses from last week.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, too, had an in­sur­ance pol­icy built from years of pru­dence, in its na­tional re­serves. The Govern­ment has dipped deeply into the re­serves to fund more than $100 bil­lion of stim­u­lus and sup­port pro­grammes to save as many jobs as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore is turn­ing the cor­ner, with the start of con­ven­tions and other eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties. Its pre­vi­ous in­vest­ments in the bio­med­i­cal sec­tor have also al­lowed it to roll out di­ag­nos­tics, de­vices and now po­ten­tial vac­cines to keep Sin­ga­pore safe as it re­opens the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Be­yond eco­nomics, Ger­many has shown great com­pas­sion in the face of hu­man suf­fer­ing. Kampfner writes that be­tween 2014 and</p>
    <p>2019, Ger­many re­ceived 1.4 mil­lion refugees, mostly from the war-torn Mid­dle East. In­te­grat­ing so many for­eign­ers has been con­tro­ver­sial and dif­fi­cult, but when it mat­tered most, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel calmly re­as­sured the peo­ple in 2015 that “wir schaf­fen das” – “we can han­dle it” in English.</p>
    <p>This call also has deep rel­e­vance for Sin­ga­pore, as we think about how we want to re­build, in the face of a post-pan­demic global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The text in a short film pro­duced by the Sin­ga­pore Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board, en­ti­tled An Open Let­ter From Sin­ga­pore, cap­tures the chal­lenge and op­por­tu­nity ahead.</p>
    <p>Dear World,</p>
    <p>Once upon a time, we had an im­pos­si­ble idea.</p>
    <p>To turn sea into land and land into one of the busiest air­ports in the world.</p>
    <p>A gate­way for dreamers, a run­way for be­liev­ers.</p>
    <p>But now our world is not quite the same.</p>
    <p>We are in the tough­est cri­sis of our gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Our skies are qui­eter and our streets too.</p>
    <p>But it’s also in this quiet that you can hear the be­lief.</p>
    <p>And in the empti­ness, see the re­solve and resilience of our peo­ple.</p>
    <p>And just like once upon a time, we now look not at what we see, but at who we are.</p>
    <p>And not what if, but what’s next. A peo­ple who stared im­pos­si­ble challenges in the face and say no, we won’t be beaten.</p>
    <p>Planes can be grounded but our spirit, never.</p>
    <p>Dear World, to­gether, we will rise again.</p>
    <p>Over the course of this year, we have ex­pe­ri­enced some of the dark­est hours this coun­try has seen. We have wit­nessed acts of great courage from our health­care pro­fes­sion­als, sac­ri­fice and sol­i­dar­ity from work­ers try­ing to save ev­ery job pos­si­ble, and ac­cel­er­ated in­no­va­tion in prod­uct of­fer­ings from com­pa­nies hus­tling to thrive in the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>As we face the fu­ture, I do be­lieve that we too can han­dle it, and rise again as a stronger and kinder Sin­ga­pore.</p>
