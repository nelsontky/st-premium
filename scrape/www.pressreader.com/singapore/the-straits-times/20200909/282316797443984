    <p>Cam­bo­dian ath­lete Kuniaki Tak­izaki said in court yes­ter­day that it would have been “to­tally im­pos­si­ble” for him to catch up with marathoner Ash­ley Liew within the one minute that he did at the 2015 SEA Games if the lat­ter “was run­ning”.</p>
    <p>The Ja­pan-born run­ner was re­spond­ing to Dis­trict Judge Lee Li Choon’s ques­tion on whether he would have reached and over­taken Sin­ga­porean Liew re­gard­less of whether he had slowed down or not.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old Tak­izaki, who was one of the 12 run­ners in the marathon event, took the stand via video con­fer­ence yes­ter­day as the plain­tiff’s wit­ness in Liew’s defama­tion suit against for­mer team­mate Soh Rui Yong.</p>
    <p>Soh had in Oc­to­ber 2018 ac­cused Liew of ly­ing about the in­ci­dent that oc­curred dur­ing the race in Sin­ga­pore, where the lat­ter said he had slowed down to al­low other run­ners to catch up af­ter they missed a U-turn and took the wrong path.</p>
    <p>When asked by the dis­trict judge if, based on his run­ning pace, he would have caught up with Liew, Tak­izaki said through an in­ter­preter: “It is im­pos­si­ble to catch up with him in one minute if he was run­ning.</p>
    <p>“Only (be­cause) he stayed, I caught up and over­took him... If he was run­ning, to­tally im­pos­si­ble to catch up with him.”</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Lee also asked Tak­izaki to ex­plain what gave him the im­pres­sion that Liew had de­lib­er­ately slowed down to let the rest catch up – as Tak­izaki had said in his af­fi­davit.</p>
    <p>The Cam­bo­dian replied that af­ter he re­alised he had gone the wrong way and cor­rected his route, he no­ticed that the “run­ner in white shirt” – whom he later iden­ti­fied as Liew – was “al­most stop­ping there, with a hand sign as if to say ‘go ahead’ to me and also to oth­ers who made the mis­take”.</p>
    <p>Tak­izaki added that he saw Liew “stand­ing there” but did not know at which point the Sin­ga­porean had stopped run­ning.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Liew’s tes­ti­mony on Sept 1, he said Tak­izaki had been the first to close the gap and over­take him af­ter get­ting back on the right route.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his cross ex­am­i­na­tion of the wit­ness yes­ter­day, Soh’s lawyer Clarence Lun as­serted that Tak­izaki and Liew’s ver­sions of events did not tally.</p>
    <p>“If you (Tak­izaki) had over­taken him at slightly over the 300m mark (from the U-turn), as (Liew) says, you would be run­ning at the speed of a bul­let train,” said Lun.</p>
    <p>“There’s only one way to rec­on­cile the fact you were 100m away (af­ter) the U-turn, and you caught up with him 300m (af­ter) the Uturn point, and the one fact is Mr Ash­ley Liew gave the wrong ev­i­dence to the court.”</p>
    <p>Tak­izaki re­sponded: “What­ever num­ber of me­tres Ash­ley is talk­ing about, I do not know. All I know is af­ter (run­ning) the wrong way for 100m, I turned back as fast as I could, and the point where I saw him, caught up with him and over­took him, was about one minute.</p>
    <p>“But ex­actly where, is one thing I don’t re­mem­ber.”</p>
    <p>Tak­izaki, who is a co­me­dian in Ja­pan, also told the court Liew is not his friend and his only re­la­tion­ship with the Sin­ga­porean is that they ran in the same 2015 SEA Games race.</p>
    <p>He added that the Cam­bo­dian Olympic Com­mit­tee had con­tacted him via his lawyer when he was asked to be a wit­ness in the case.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues to­day, with Liew ex­pected back in court while Soh will tes­tify on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>MAT­TER OF SPEED</p>
    <p>Only (be­cause) he stayed, I caught up and over­took him... If he was run­ning, to­tally im­pos­si­ble to catch up with ’’ him.</p>
