    <p>Bangladesh­i Shamol Sarker, 23, used to be wary of mov­ing cars and res­i­dents when driv­ing his bin wagon in the morn­ings. But dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, he could drive around freely with­out worry. As an es­sen­tial worker, he had to keep work­ing when most of the coun­try was at a stand­still. The town coun­cil cleaner said he had to make more trips than usual as the amount of garbage had in­creased sig­nif­i­cantly. His mother wanted him to re­turn home when the Covid-19 out­break oc­curred, but he is thank­ful that he stayed. “I get to work and earn money,” he said. “And Sin­ga­pore is do­ing such a good job, I am not afraid any more.” In fact, he is wor­ried about his fam­ily in Bangladesh, where he says peo­ple do not wear masks when out. Mr Shamol, who is al­ready a fa­mil­iar face to res­i­dents in Boon Lay Drive where he works and lives, is anx­iously wait­ing to see if his work per­mit can be re­newed for an­other three years.</p>
