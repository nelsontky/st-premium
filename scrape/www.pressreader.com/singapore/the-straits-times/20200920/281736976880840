    <p>A mas­sive fire that broke out at the Sem­bawang God of Wealth Tem­ple on Fri­day night killed three of the seven dogs that lived on the premises but left the stat­ues of var­i­ous deities in­tact.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) spokesman told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day that fire­fight­ers found the three dog car­casses dur­ing their night op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>It took fire­fight­ers about three hours, from 9.15pm to mid­night, to ex­tin­guish the flames. They con­tin­ued to spray wa­ter for sev­eral hours to pre­vent the fire from rekin­dling, a process known as damp­ing down.</p>
    <p>The tem­ple man­age­ment clar­i­fied in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that it had been car­ing for the seven stray dogs. “We do not chain up our dogs and they are free to roam the tem­ple com­pound dur­ing the night.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, we have lost three of them as they were trapped on the sec­ond level when the fire broke out. The re­main­ing four man­aged to es­cape and are safe,” it added. The tem­ple has four storeys.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung and Dr Lim Wee Kiak, both MPs for Sem­bawang GRC, vis­ited the tem­ple yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said in an In­sta­gram post later that the dam­age to the tem­ple was ex­ten­sive but no­body was in­jured. The stat­ues of all the deities were also “mirac­u­lously” in­tact, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Lim noted on Face­book that “what was re­ally sur­pris­ing was the five stat­ues of the God of Wealth in the main prayer hall were rel­a­tively un­dam­aged by the fire”. “Ku­dos to the 12 fire en­gines and 62 SCDF fire­fight­ers who put out the fire amid strong winds last night.”</p>
    <p>The man­age­ment said on Face­book that the tem­ple will be closed un­til fur­ther no­tice. “Thank­fully, our God of Wealth Hall and God­dess of Mercy Hall are still in­tact and we hope to re­open as soon as we can.”</p>
    <p>The Taoist Fed­er­a­tion is in talks with the tem­ple man­age­ment on how to ren­der as­sis­tance, its chair­man Tan Thiam Lye said.</p>
    <p>He told Chi­nese-lan­guage daily Shin Min Daily News that the Sem­bawang God of Wealth tem­ple started as a small tem­ple and was painstak­ingly built up to its cur­rent size through years of fundrais­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the tem­ple’s web­site, prepa­ra­tions to build the $3 mil­lion, 20,000 sq ft tem­ple be­gan as early as 1998. The con­struc­tion it­self be­gan in 2004.</p>
    <p>The tem­ple is known for a 9.44m-tall statue of the God of Wealth on its rooftop, said to be the largest of its kind in the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that he will call a meet­ing with mem­bers of the fed­er­a­tion next week and urge them to be mind­ful of oil lamps and other flammable ma­te­ri­als in their tem­ples to pre­vent sim­i­lar in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Co­in­ci­den­tally, the tem­ple’s for­mer chair­man, Mr Chee Tig Liang, died in his home yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese-lan­guage evening daily Lianhe Wan­bao quoted Mr Chew Hai Hoo, the tem­ple’s cur­rent chair­man, as say­ing that Mr Chee had re­tired as chair­man two or three years ago and had been bat­tling an un­spec­i­fied ill­ness at home since.</p>
