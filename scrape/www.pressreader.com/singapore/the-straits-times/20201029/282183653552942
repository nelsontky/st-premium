    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares posted a third straight day of losses as sen­ti­ments con­tin­ued to be hurt by t he Covid-19 surge, more global eco­nomic gloom and risks tied to the United States elec­tion. Wall Street’s wob­bly ses­sion overnight added more salt to in­jury.</p>
    <p>The key Straits Times In­dex (STI) traded un­der wa­ter all day and closed at a near five-week low of 2,483.48 af­ter fall­ing 29.39 points or 1.17 per cent.</p>
    <p>Key Asian gauges fared mixed, with Ja­pan and Hong Kong fall­ing 0.3 per cent. Aus­tralia, China and South Korea ad­vanced be­tween 0.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Trad­ing the US elec­tion’s risk fab­ric is be­com­ing in­ter­wo­ven with as­sess­ing global down­side eco­nomic risks from tight­en­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity mea­sures in the euro zone,” said Axi’s Stephen Innes.</p>
    <p>A new wave of Covid-19 cases has hit many Euro­pean coun­tries in­clud­ing Rus­sia, France and Italy, forc­ing some to im­pose new curbs.</p>
    <p>“Lo­calised beat­down i n eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity across the euro zone could drive broader doom and gloom on the global re­cov­ery in 2021 be­fore a vac­cine be­comes avail­able,” Mr Innes added.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, DBS Group Re­search noted that Sin­ga­pore has sta­bilised its Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, and while the econ­omy is on the mend amid the phased re­open­ing and re­cov­ery in some re­gional mar­kets, the pickup will be un­even.</p>
    <p>Over­all trad­ing vol­ume in the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket stood at 1.33 bil­lion shares worth $1.08 bil­lion. Among the STI con­stituents, three coun­ters were up and 24 were down. Sin­ga­pore’s three bank­ing stal­warts DBS, OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank led the losses, which col­lec­tively lopped 15.3 in­dex points off the STI.</p>
    <p>Top­ping the day’s most ac­tive list was Jiu­tian Chem­i­cal with some 250 mil­lion shares worth $21.3 mil­lion chang­ing hands. The Catal­ist counter closed up 1.2 per cent to 8.3 cents fol­low­ing the com­ple­tion on Tues­day of a $10.3 mil­lion share place­ment at an is­sue price of 6.03 cents.</p>
    <p>SIA En­gi­neer­ing lost 2.9 per cent to $1.68.</p>
    <p>The air­craft main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul arm of Sin­ga­pore Air­lines is­sued a profit guid­ance yes­ter­day morn­ing that said it will recog­nise a non-cash im­pair­ment pro­vi­sion against its base main­te­nance unit’s as­sets. This, it said, is ex­pected to have a ma­te­rial im­pact on first-half fis­cal year re­sults.</p>
    <p>DBS fell nearly 2 per cent to $20.90. A dig­i­tal cur­rency ex­change backed by South-east Asia’s largest lender is in the works, news re­ports said. DBS is still in the process of seek­ing reg­u­la­tory ap­proval.</p>
