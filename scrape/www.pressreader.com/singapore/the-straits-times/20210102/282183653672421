    <p>The challenges faced by the re­gion 50 years ago – as As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Si­mon Tay high­lighted in his com­men­tary – are still highly rel­e­vant to­day (Echoes of a tu­mult... from South-east Asia 50 years ago, Dec 30).</p>
    <p>Prof Tay’s ob­ser­va­tions re­lat­ing to his fa­ther Tay Seow Huah’s in­sights were spot on.</p>
    <p>A few peo­ple who served un­der his fa­ther, my­self in­cluded, can vouch for them.</p>
    <p>The se­nior Mr Tay, the found­ing di­rec­tor of the Se­cu­rity and In­tel­li­gence Divi­sion, was al­ways highly pro­fes­sional and de­manded fore­sight and qual­ity re­search from his of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing those years, that was ex­pected of Mr Tay and his of­fi­cers them­selves by found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew and Old Guard min­is­ter Goh Keng Swee, who were very dis­cern­ing of writ­ten re­ports.</p>
    <p>Prof Tay said, “look­ing back at a 50-year arc of time... we may to­day bor­row wis­dom and take courage for the times ahead”.</p>
    <p>In­deed, we are fac­ing very dif­fi­cult times with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the un­cer­tain trade and in­vest­ment out­look, se­cu­rity is­sues, and the geopol­i­tics of the re­gion.</p>
    <p>I look for­ward to the con­tin­ued prag­matic lead­er­ship by the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment, sup­ported by pro­fes­sional civil ser­vants who have the fore­sight and gump­tion to pro­vide the nec­es­sary ad­vice.</p>
