    <p>Growth in Sin­ga­pore’s non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) picked up pace last month, boost­ing ex­pec­ta­tions that this year’s ship­ments will beat gov­ern­ment es­ti­mates. Nodx rose 7.7 per cent year on year last month, mainly driven by non-elec­tronic goods, ac­cord­ing to data from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Growth in Sin­ga­pore’s non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) picked up pace last month, boost­ing ex­pec­ta­tions that this year’s ship­ments will beat gov­ern­ment es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Nodx rose 7.7 per cent year on year in Au­gust, mainly driven by non-elec­tronic goods, ac­cord­ing to data from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) yes­ter­day. The in­crease was more than dou­ble the 3.3 per cent ex­pan­sion fore­cast by pri­vate an­a­lysts in a Bloomberg sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Nodx has now risen in six out of the eight months this year, a ro­bust per­for­mance when com­pared with only one month of gain last year.</p>
    <p>The gain in July’s Nodx was re­vised down to 5.9 per cent, from 6 per cent. Ship­ments were up 13.9 per cent in June af­ter a 4.6 per cent drop in May.</p>
    <p>ESG last month raised Sin­ga­pore’s 2020 trade fore­casts, pre­dict­ing Nodx to grow by 3 per cent to 5 per cent year on year, com­pared with an ear­lier fore­cast for a 1 per cent to 4 per cent fall.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Lee Ju Ye noted Sin­ga­pore’s Nodx has risen by 5.9 per cent in the year to date, in con­trast to the plunge of 11 per cent dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2009. Nodx dropped 14 per cent in 2001 in the wake of the re­ces­sion caused by the dot.com bust.</p>
    <p>“While the Covid-19 pan­demic has re­sulted in sig­nif­i­cant dis­rup­tion to peo­ple flows due to lock­downs and bor­der con­trols, the im­pact on man­u­fac­tur­ing sup­ply chains and trade flows has been much less se­vere,” Ms Lee said.</p>
    <p>“We are, how­ever, mind­ful of the down­side risks, in­clud­ing a resur­gence of Covid-19 in parts of Eu­rope, and in­ten­si­fy­ing US-China ten­sions that could dis­rupt global sup­ply chains,” she added.</p>
    <p>ESG data showed ship­ments of non-mon­e­tary gold, spe­cialised ma­chin­ery and food prepa­ra­tions led Au­gust’s gains, fol­lowed by elec­tronic ex­ports. Non-elec­tronic Nodx rose by 8.3 per cent last month, fol­low­ing the 6.9 per cent growth in the pre­vi­ous month. The gains were led by non-mon­e­tary gold, spe­cialised ma­chin­ery and food prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic ex­ports of non-mon­e­tary gold have gained mo­men­tum this year amid hoard­ing of phys­i­cal gold as a safe-haven as­set in view of the global eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic ship­ments rose 5.7 per cent, af­ter a 2.8 per cent rise in July, with in­te­grated cir­cuits or chips, disk me­dia prod­ucts and per­sonal com­put­ers con­tribut­ing the most.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said elec­tron­ics and non-elec­tron­ics ex­ports have chalked up year-to-date growth of 4 per cent and 6.5 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“At the cur­rent run rate, it is plau­si­ble that the full-year Nodx growth will be at the top end of the ESG fore­cast range,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ling noted that not­with­stand­ing the US-China ten­sions, the re­cov­ery in China is be­ing aided by its fo­cus on do­mes­tic growth.</p>
    <p>Global growth prospects have im­proved too. The Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and Devel­op­ment re­cently up­graded its 2020 world growth fore­cast to a milder con­trac­tion of 4.5 per cent, from an ear­lier es­ti­mate of mi­nus 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>The US Fed­eral Re­serve now ex­pects US gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth this year to shrink 3.7 per cent, com­pared with mi­nus 6.5 per cent pre­vi­ously, Ms Ling said.</p>
    <p>Nodx to Sin­ga­pore’s top mar­kets as a whole grew last month, though ex­ports to In­done­sia, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thai­land de­clined. The largest con­trib­u­tors to the Nodx growth were China, the Euro­pean Union and the United States.</p>
    <p>But Ms Sung Eun Jung, a Sin­ga­pore-based econ­o­mist at Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics, said weaker and un­even data for re-ex­ports calls for some cau­tion on the out­look.</p>
    <p>ESG data showed non-oil re-ex­ports rose by 0.1 per cent year on year last month, af­ter a 3.1 per cent de­cline in July. “The prospects for a con­tin­ued re­cov­ery in re-ex­ports are much more un­cer­tain as coun­tries around the world still grap­ple with Covid-19,” Ms Jung said.</p>
