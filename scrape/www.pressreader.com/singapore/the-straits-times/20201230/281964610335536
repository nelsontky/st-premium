    <p>I strongly agree with Ms Anthea Ong that men­tal health at the work­place must go be­yond the re­spon­si­bil­ity of hu­man re­source depart­ments (Lead­er­ship in the new nor­mal must en­sure em­ployee well-be­ing, Dec 25).</p>
    <p>It must be a pri­or­ity for the en­tire or­gan­i­sa­tion and guide all de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Amid the pan­demic, lead­ers must step up and re­sist the temp­ta­tion to treat em­ployee as­sis­tance pro­grammes as band-aid so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Rather, in pro­vid­ing ad­di­tional sup­port, they should also be will­ing to ad­dress more fun­da­men­tal is­sues such as or­gan­i­sa­tional cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Like it did with the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the five-day work week to im­prove work-life bal­ance back in 2004, the Gov­ern­ment could lead the way once again in im­prov­ing men­tal health at the work­place.</p>
    <p>As with other in­dus­tries, bu­reau­crats work­ing across gov­ern­ment min­istries and statu­tory boards have had to deal with ad­di­tional work­load and pres­sures aris­ing from the pan­demic, on top of their busi­ness-as-usual func­tions.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to our front-line health­care work­ers, other pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions have also adapted seam­lessly to the new nor­mal. These in­clude the social service of­fices, the ju­di­ciary and our Home Team, just to name a few. They have kept things mov­ing and shielded Sin­ga­pore from the worst ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As the largest em­ployer in Sin­ga­pore, the Gov­ern­ment could set an ex­am­ple by im­prov­ing ac­cess to and pro­mot­ing men­tal health sup­port for our 146,000 or so pub­lic ser­vants, as rec­om­mended by the Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Men­tal Well-be­ing at Work­places.</p>
    <p>This would send a sig­nal to busi­nesses to pri­ori­tise the men­tal health of their em­ploy­ees as well.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey of 211 peo­ple that Talk Your Heart Out re­cently con­ducted on staff well-be­ing at the work­place (in partnershi­p with crowd­sourc­ing plat­form OPPi), some in­ter­est­ing find­ings emerged.</p>
    <p>While 70 per cent of re­spon­dents ac­knowl­edged they “know some­one at their work­place who would ben­e­fit from pro­fes­sional men­tal health and well-be­ing sup­port”, close to 60 per cent also ad­mit­ted that “my ca­reer pro­gres­sion might be com­pro­mised if I were to talk about my men­tal health at work”.</p>
    <p>These statistics, if rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the wider pop­u­la­tion, are sober­ing.</p>
    <p>Men­tal health, like phys­i­cal health, should be a pri­or­ity for ev­ery­one. There­fore, it is important to fa­cil­i­tate open con­ver­sa­tions and nor­malise men­tal health sup­port.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that with the Gov­ern­ment lead­ing the way, other em­ploy­ers, big and small, will be en­cour­aged to take the men­tal health of their work­ers se­ri­ously, too.</p>
