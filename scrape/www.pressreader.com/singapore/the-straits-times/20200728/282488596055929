    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain’s Prince Harry took of­fence at what he thought was Prince Wil­liam’s “snob­bish­ness” when he ad­vised his brother to “take as much time as you need to get to know this girl” when he was dat­ing Meghan Markle, a new book says.</p>
    <p>Harry and his wife have dis­tanced them­selves from the book called Find­ing Free­dom, say­ing they were not in­ter­viewed for the bi­og­ra­phy and made no con­tri­bu­tions to it.</p>
    <p>“This book is based on t he au­thors’ own ex­pe­ri­ences as mem­bers of the royal press corps and their own in­de­pen­dent re­port­ing,” a spokesman for the cou­ple said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Find­ing Free­dom, au­thored by royal re­porters Carolyn Du­rand and Omid Sco­bie, is se­ri­alised by The Times and The Sun­day Times news­pa­pers.</p>
    <p>The book doc­u­ments, cit­ing sources, a time when Harry and Markle were dat­ing and Wil­liam wanted to make sure the Amer­i­can ac­tress had the right in­ten­tions, The Sun­day Times said.</p>
    <p>“Don’t feel you need to rush this,” Wil­liam told Harry, ac­cord­ing to sources cited by the book. “Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl.”</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times said Harry heard a tone of snob­bish­ness in the last two words, “this girl”, and that Harry no longer felt he needed look­ing af­ter.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple and their son Archie now live in Los An­ge­les af­ter they stepped down from their royal roles in March to forge new ca­reers.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, they an­nounced plans to lead a more in­de­pen­dent life and to finance it them­selves.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ex­tracts from the new book, Harry, 35, and Markle, 38, blamed “viper” courtiers for widen­ing their rift with the royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The book, to be re­leased on Aug 11, claims that Harry felt “un­pro­tected” by his fam­ily and lay bare his split from brother Wil­liam and his wife Kate Mid­dle­ton.</p>
    <p>Mid­dle­ton even re­fused to make eye con­tact with her sis­ter-in-law at their fi­nal en­gage­ment in March, ac­cord­ing to the new re­lease.</p>
    <p>Harry ap­par­ently re­ferred to se­nior courtiers as “vipers” who felt that the global pop­u­lar­ity of the cou­ple was over­shad­ow­ing the fam­ily and “needed to be reined in”, ac­cord­ing to ex­tracts.</p>
    <p>The book also sug­gested that Harry was the driv­ing force be­hind the cou­ple’s move away from the fam­ily, with Markle telling her hus­band that she gave up her “en­tire life for this fam­ily”.</p>
    <p>Harry and Markle mar­ried in May 2018 in a wed­ding her­alded at the time as in­fus­ing a blast of Hol­ly­wood glam­our and moder­nity into the Bri­tish monar­chy and which made them one of the world’s big­gest celebrity cou­ples.</p>
