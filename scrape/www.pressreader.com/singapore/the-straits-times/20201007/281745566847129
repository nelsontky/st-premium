    <p>About nine in 10 el­i­gi­ble em­ploy­ees re­ceived a pay­out when they lost their jobs, based on Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) data for the last six months.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite such com­pen­sa­tion not be­ing man­dated by law.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that about 84 per cent of this group were given at least two weeks’ salary per year of ser­vice. The fig­ures are based on retrenchme­nt no­ti­fi­ca­tions re­ceived by her min­istry be­tween April and Septem­ber, she said.</p>
    <p>About two in three of the em­ploy­ees who were laid off were el­i­gi­ble for retrenchme­nt ben­e­fits as they had worked for their em­ployer for at least two years, she added, not­ing that even among em­ploy­ees who were not el­i­gi­ble, al­most half re­ceived some retrenchme­nt pay­out.</p>
    <p>The pre­vail­ing norm is a pay­out of be­tween two weeks’ and one month’s salary per year of ser­vice, de­pend­ing on the fi­nan­cial po­si­tion of the com­pany and in­dus­try prac­tices, ac­cord­ing to the tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on man­ag­ing ex­cess man­power and re­spon­si­ble retrenchme­nt.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that Par­lia­ment had de­bated in the past the ques­tion of whether a base­line retrenchme­nt ben­e­fit should be leg­is­lated, but the con­sen­sus among the Gov­ern­ment, unions and em­ploy­ers is that it does not guar­an­tee bet­ter out­comes for re­trenched em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“Even when em­ploy­ers can af­ford to pay more, they would be un­likely to do so. On the other hand, set­ting a high base­line retrenchme­nt ben­e­fit would strain the fi­nan­cial health of busi­nesses that are al­ready strug­gling, and po­ten­tially jeop­ar­dise their vi­a­bil­ity and the jobs of the re­main­ing em­ploy­ees,” she said, re­spond­ing to Work­ers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC).</p>
    <p>She added that if a retrenchme­nt ben­e­fit was leg­is­lated, em­ploy­ers would be less likely to of­fer longterm or per­ma­nent con­tracts to em­ploy­ees, and re­sort more to hir­ing em­ploy­ees on short-term con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also said that about 90 per cent of the work­force is cov­ered by the retrenchme­nt no­ti­fi­ca­tion re­quire­ment, un­der which em­ploy­ers must no­tify MOM within five work­ing days of telling staff of their retrenchme­nt, if they have at least 10 em­ploy­ees and lay off at least five of them within any six-month pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ms Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) asked how the tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on man­ag­ing ex­cess man­power and re­spon­si­ble retrenchme­nt and gov­ern­ment poli­cies en­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans are bet­ter off than per­ma­nent res­i­dents and non-Sin­ga­pore­ans in terms of job and in­come se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>In re­ply, Mrs Teo said that based on her min­istry’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion of retrenchme­nt cases, firms have gen­er­ally made se­ri­ous ef­forts to re­tain Sin­ga­pore­ans in their work­force.</p>
    <p>She said the tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory em­pha­sises lay­offs as a last re­sort, and calls on em­ploy­ers to main­tain a strong Sin­ga­porean core even as they ad­just their head­count. Where lay­offs are un­avoid­able, Work­force Sin­ga­pore and the Na­tional Trades Union Congress of­fer job as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>“Where re­trench­ments can­not be avoided, we will watch out for Sin­ga­pore­ans, give full sup­port to em­ploy­ers’ ef­forts to re­tain them or to help them move into new jobs as quickly as pos­si­ble,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans re­ceive ex­tra sup­port in so­cial poli­cies such as education, train­ing and health­care, and schemes like Work­fare and Silver Sup­port, which boost in­comes dur­ing work and in re­tire­ment, ap­ply only to cit­i­zens, she added.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing con­cerns raised by Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang) about ageism, es­pe­cially in the cur­rent slack job mar­ket, Mrs Teo said that Sin­ga­pore’s em­ploy­ment laws pro­tect em­ploy­ees against dis­crim­i­na­tory em­ploy­ment prac­tices, in­clud­ing wrong­ful dis­missal on grounds of age. She added that de­spite the cur­rent eco­nomic un­cer­tainty, the un­em­ploy­ment rate for lo­cals aged 60 and over re­mains com­pa­ra­ble to that of the over­all work­force.</p>
