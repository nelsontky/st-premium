    <p>A 24-year-old TVB artist has be­come the first Hong Kong en­ter­tainer con­firmed to be di­ag­nosed with Covid-19, prompt­ing fears of more in­fec­tions even as the broad­caster closed its head­quar­ters TVB City for two days, ac­cord­ing to Hong Kong me­dia.</p>
    <p>Singer Zaina Sze tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus last Satur­day. Her man­ager Ap­ple Lau, 57, and Lau’s boyfriend, 62-year-old ac­tor Robert Mak, as well as her pro­moter, Ah Jia, have also been di­ag­nosed with Covid-19. All four are seek­ing treat­ment at Kowloon’s Queen El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>While nei­ther Sze nor her man­ager has dis­played any symp­toms, Mak has ex­pe­ri­enced breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, ac­cord­ing to Hong Kong’s Ori­en­tal Daily News.</p>
    <p>With TVB City closed, ac­tiv­i­ties for pro­grammes have also been halted, in­clud­ing the cancellati­on of a live pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>TVB has in­formed those who came into con­tact with the in­fected in­di­vid­u­als in a list re­leased last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>More than 100 peo­ple had come into con­tact with Sze and Ah Jia, mostly crew mem­bers, but also in­clud­ing 20 en­ter­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Irene Wan, 53, was among those feared to have been ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus. But she as­sured fans she was fine in a Weibo post over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Kayan Yau, 20, who at­tended a drama class with Sze last Wed­nes­day, also as­sured fans that she had not been in­fected.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter I got to know the news, I im­me­di­ately went to do a test. I’ve just re­ceived a call from the hos­pi­tal and the re­sult is neg­a­tive,” she wrote in an on­line post on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>There are con­cerns that other artists, in­clud­ing lead­ing ac­tor Ron Ng, 40, might have been ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus af­ter they at­tended a din­ner with Mak re­cently, Hong Kong me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of TVB City comes amid a surge of Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong, with more than 500 in­fec­tions con­firmed in the past two weeks. The city has rolled out stricter so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, in­clud­ing get­ting civil ser­vants to work from home for a week and mak­ing it com­pul­sory to wear a mask at in­door venues.</p>
    <p>Aside from TVB City, Sze also ap­peared in an in­ter­view at Metro Broad­cast Cor­po­ra­tion. While it has not closed its head­quar­ters, the com­pany has told non-duty and lo­gis­tics staff to work from home, and ramped up dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
