    <p>When t he $1.7 bil­lion Jewel Changi Air­port opened its doors in April last year, it was to much fan­fare and large crowds.</p>
    <p>But a year and a half later, with leisure and busi­ness air travel prac­ti­cally dis­ap­pear­ing amid the rag­ing Covid-19 pan­demic, the situation is markedly dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Some re­tail and food and bev­er­age stores have called it quits. Of about 15 stalls in Jewel’s food­court, more than one-third have been va­cated. Sev­eral of the re­main­ing busi­nesses are also sus­tain­ing losses while ea­gerly wait­ing for tourists to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness at Changi Air­port’s ter­mi­nals have been hard hit as well, with re­tail sales plung­ing 74 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>At Ter­mi­nal 1 and Ter­mi­nal 3, which re­main open, only about half of the out­lets in the tran­sit ar­eas are open. Ter­mi­nal 2 is closed, af­ter plans for up­grad­ing works were brought for­ward, while op­er­a­tions at Ter­mi­nal 4 have been sus­pended ow­ing to the low num­ber of flights.</p>
    <p>But there is hope that things are grad­u­ally im­prov­ing for these busi­nesses af­ter they hit rock bot­tom dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Ms Hung Jean, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Jewel Changi Air­port De­vel­op­ment, told The Straits Times that vis­i­tor foot­fall has in­creased by more than three­fold com­pared with dur­ing phase one, af­ter the cir­cuit breaker. “We are en­cour­aged that monthly foot­fall con­tin­ued to in­crease steadily on a monthly ba­sis since the (start) of phase two,” she added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she ac­knowl­edged that the pan­demic has made op­er­at­ing con­di­tions “more chal­leng­ing” for mall op­er­a­tors and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Checks by The Straits Times found that some busi­nesses have left Jewel in the last few months. These in­clude d’Good Cafe, sou­venir shop Lit­tle Red Dot Gifts, jew­ellery shop Ri­sis and op­ti­cal re­tailer Vi­sion Lab Eye­wear.</p>
    <p>Jewel has more than 280 shops and food and bev­er­age out­lets in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Ms Hung said some ten­ants had to exit “due to sys­temic rea­sons and weak con­di­tions world­wide”.</p>
    <p>She noted that Jewel has also been able to at­tract new ten­ants de­spite the cur­rent chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>These in­clude cafe % Ara­bica, bub­ble tea store Chicha San Chen and cloth­ing out­let Is­land Shop.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited Jewel on a Thurs­day af­ter­noon ear­lier this month, most re­tail shops were empty or had just a hand­ful of cus­tomers, while res­tau­rant staff were kept busy with a small lunchtime crowd.</p>
    <p>Later in the even­ing, the base­ment lev­els, which mostly com­prise food and bev­er­age out­lets, were no­tice­ably more crowded, although re­tail out­lets re­mained rel­a­tively empty.</p>
    <p>Sales staff at more than a dozen busi­nesses at Jewel said they have seen crowds – mostly lo­cals – re­turn­ing to Jewel on Fri­days and week­ends.</p>
    <p>But for most of them, busi­ness has been painfully slow be­tween Mon­days and Thurs­days.</p>
    <p>Some staff also said week­end prof­its are not enough to cover the losses sus­tained on week­days.</p>
    <p>Ms Me­hanash, who goes by one name and works at Sankranti Changi Ex­press In­dian food stall, said: “I may have about 15 cus­tomers dur­ing lunchtime on week­ends, but I have seen only one so far to­day.”</p>
    <p>A staff mem­ber at shoe shop Bata said busi­ness is down by about 50 per cent com­pared with be­fore the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants and cin­ema op­er­a­tor Shaw The­atres have also been af­fected by the en­forced re­duced ca­pac­ity to fa­cil­i­tate safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Noor Hisham Mo­hamad Sainan, as­sis­tant man­ager at Four Sea­sons Res­tau­rant, said it is op­er­at­ing at 50 per cent of its usual ca­pac­ity. “This means our turnover of ta­bles is slower,” he said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Shaw said busi­ness has been down sig­nif­i­cantly com­pared with last year. This is mainly due to movie re­leases get­ting de­layed, and the re­duced num­ber of screen­ing ses­sions and ca­pac­ity to meet Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are en­cour­aged to see the strong ef­forts in­tro­duced by the Jewel team to bring in more cus­tomers and help us as a ten­ant,” added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, as we are cur­rently op­er­at­ing at around 50 per cent ca­pac­ity in com­pli­ance with safe man­age­ment mea­sures, rental re­bates would be a great help to as­sist us with keep­ing our busi­ness vi­able.”</p>
    <p>Mr Haidar Ali, 30, the out­let man­ager at Stuff’d, said it would be help­ful if Jewel could fur­ther shorten the re­quired op­er­at­ing hours for busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“We have cer­tain hours to com­mit to, even though our man­power is lim­ited, so it is a bit of a strain on us,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Stuff’d out­let op­er­ates from 11am to 10pm be­tween Sun­days and Thurs­days. On Fri­days, Satur­days and eve of pub­lic hol­i­days, it op­er­ates from 10am to 10pm.</p>
    <p>These hours had been short­ened from 8am to around mid­night pre­vi­ously. But Mr Haidar noted that now, the num­ber of cus­tomers around 10am and af­ter 8pm on week­days is quite low.</p>
    <p>While dif­fer­ent busi­nesses at Jewel have dif­fer­ent op­er­at­ing hours, with many op­er­at­ing for about 12 hours each day, the sug­ges­tion for shorter hours was also raised by staff at a few other stores.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing this con­cern, Jewel’s Ms Hung said most ten­ants al­ready have shorter op­er­at­ing times af­ter Jewel re­viewed the i ssue, with phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing. She added that Jewel will con­tinue to work with them to en­sure a re­li­able and sus­tain­able ex­pe­ri­ence for vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond the rental re­bates we have pro­vided to ten­ants, we be­lieve it is im­por­tant to ac­tively help drive foot­fall by rolling out ex­cit­ing mar­ket­ing ini­tia­tives and pro­mo­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Hung also said Jewel has been look­ing to fur­ther sup­port busi­nesses by get­ting them onto the on­line shop­ping plat­forms man­aged by Jewel’s de­vel­op­ers Changi Air­port Group and Cap­i­taLand.</p>
    <p>De­spite the cur­rent down­turn, most Jewel staff The Straits Times spoke to re­main upbeat and hope­ful that tourists would re­turn soon.</p>
    <p>A staff mem­ber at a Chi­nese res­tau­rant in Jewel, who de­clined to be named, said: “The econ­omy now is so bad, so as long as I still have work, I am grate­ful. I don’t want to ask for too much.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Few shop&#xAD;pers were seen at Jewel Changi Air&#xAD;port last Thurs&#xAD;day af&#xAD;ter&#xAD;noon. Some busi&#xAD;nesses told The Straits Times that week&#xAD;end prof&#xAD;its are not enough to cover the losses sus&#xAD;tained on week&#xAD;days when the mall sees lower foot&#xAD;fall.</p>
