    <p>Four board mem­bers of Catal­ist-listed Ax­ing­ton, a pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices firm, quit in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows the res­ig­na­tion of former United States am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar last week as an in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>The five res­ig­na­tions leave Ax­ing­ton’s board with just two mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany came un­der the spot­light over the past week for its links to the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, which made a bid for English Pre­mier League foot­ball club Newcastle United.</p>
    <p>MS EVAN­GE­LINE SHEN, ALSO KNOWN AS SHEN CHE</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, 32, was the non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) fil­ing said she is re­sign­ing as a re­sult of strate­gic changes that are ex­pected to be made in the com­pany. She is also the co-founder of the BN Group.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen is a Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant who stud­ied law and worked as an in­vest­ment banker.</p>
    <p>MS MAR­JORY LOH</p>
    <p>Ms Loh, 37, was the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor. She is the sis­ter of Mr Ter­ence Loh and cousin of Mr Nel­son Loh, both co-founders of the BN Group and Ax­ing­ton’s con­trol­ling share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The SGX fil­ing stated that Ms Loh is re­sign­ing due to “re­cent in­tense pub­lic scru­tiny” of the com­pany and added that she feels it is in the firm’s best in­ter­est for her to step down.</p>
    <p>MR WONG SOON YUH</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, 41, was the non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>He is also named as Michael Wong in the lead­er­ship team for NETX, which was the pro­posed name change for Ax­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>He re­signed due to the im­pend­ing changes in the firm’s busi­ness strat­egy. More de­tails will be dis­closed once the board has re­ceived clar­ity from the firm’s con­trol­ling share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>MR CHUA SIONG KIAT</p>
    <p>Mr Chua, 49, was the lead in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>He was also named on the NETX web­site, which is no longer ac­ces­si­ble, as Alex Chua.</p>
    <p>He re­signed due to health rea­sons, the SGX fil­ing said.</p>
