    <p>The hope of a quick turn­around in the global avi­a­tion sec­tor – al­ready dim – has be­come even dim­mer with the global Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion go­ing from bad to worse.</p>
    <p>More air­line bank­rupt­cies and job cuts are likely to be in the pipe­line in the com­ing months once gov­ern­ment sup­port is re­duced.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Wy­att, head of re­search and anal­y­sis in travel and tourism at an­a­lyt­ics firm Glob­alData, said gov­ern­ments are nat­u­rally keen to fa­cil­i­tate travel bub­bles, given the eco­nomic sig­nif­i­cance of the tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, most gov­ern­ments are adopt­ing a safety-first ap­proach and new waves (of Covid-19) will make them more cau­tious,” said Mr Wy­att. “They will cer­tainly mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion in other coun­tries be­fore de­cid­ing whether to in­clude them in any such ar­range­ments.”</p>
    <p>This has re­sulted in some high-pro­file omis­sions from travel bub­bles, such as Bri­tain not in­clud­ing Por­tu­gal in such ar­range­ments with 50 coun­tries, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wy­att said it will be hard to de­ter­mine when the worst is over for the avi­a­tion in­dus­try as long as there are new waves of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion last Satur­day re­ported a record in­crease in global Covid-19 cases for the sec­ond day in a row, with the to­tal ris­ing by 259,848 in 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Some places that had done a good job of con­trol­ling the pan­demic, such as Hong Kong and Aus­tralia, are now see­ing cases ris­ing.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Shukor Yu­sof of En­dau An­a­lyt­ics said the new wave will “not only dampen ap­petite for bub­bles but re­tard any like­li­hood of bor­ders re­open­ing any time soon”.</p>
    <p>He added: “There has been an over-ex­u­ber­ance on the part of air­lines and other bod­ies want­ing to restart flights when the dan­ger of con­tract­ing the virus re­mains pre­sent. The in­dus­try should ac­cept this is a long, bruis­ing bat­tle and not rush back into fly­ing.”</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion has said that pas­sen­ger de­mand for air travel is not ex­pected to re­turn to pre-cri­sis lev­els un­til 2023 or 2024.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is that air­lines are in the very early stages of a long and dif­fi­cult road to re­cov­ery and are nowhere near sus­tain­able lev­els if in­ter­na­tional travel con­tin­ues to re­main closed or re­stricted,” it told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie from So­bie Avi­a­tion said the in­dus­try has been ex­pect­ing a slow and choppy re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>But he said the main is­sue in terms of the re­cov­ery within the Asean re­gion was the lack of a mul­ti­lat­eral frame­work stan­dar­d­is­ing air travel reg­u­la­tions. This would have helped to pro­vide a plat­form for in­tro­duc­ing travel bub­bles among coun­tries</p>
    <p>that have done well in han­dling the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr So­bie and Mr Wy­att agreed that more air­line bank­rupt­cies and job cuts could come amid a slow re­cov­ery of the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr So­bie, who noted that air­lines that have staved off job cuts have been helped by gov­ern­ment schemes, said: “Th­ese schemes are not per­ma­nent, and it’s not rea­son­able to ex­pect gov­ern­ments to con­tinue of­fer­ing sub­si­dies on wages to al­low com­pa­nies to main­tain their work­force at the lev­els be­fore Covid-19 when it’s go­ing to be a few years be­fore traf­fic re­turns.”</p>
