    <p>The French foot­ball phi­los­o­phy that pro­duced the likes of Paris Saint-Ger­main star Kylian Mbappe, Thierry Henry and Ni­cholas Anelka and made Les Bleus world cham­pi­ons will now be taught in Sin­ga­pore, with the French Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion (FFF) open­ing the French Foot­ball Academy yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is be­lieved that this is the first time the na­tional fed­er­a­tion of a foot­ball pow­er­house has set up such a ven­ture in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The academy will be led by a French­man fa­mil­iar to lo­cal fans, former Etoile FC coach Pa­trick Vallee – who led them to the SLeague ti­tle in 2010. Vallee, 58, will be its tech­ni­cal direc­tor and in charge of train­ing the 10 coaches.</p>
    <p>At the launch at Gems World Academy in Yishun, he said: “I am very proud to take this po­si­tion. The el­e­ment that con­vinced me was the pos­si­bil­ity of work­ing un­der the aegis of the FFF, rep­re­sent­ing this in­sti­tu­tion... recog­nised world­wide and con­vey­ing its pos­i­tive im­age in terms of our train­ing.</p>
    <p>“The idea is to ex­port not just a name and a logo, but a recog­nised know-how and to ben­e­fit a whole gen­er­a­tion of young play­ers from it.”</p>
    <p>The academy, l ocated at Our Tampines Hub and Gems World Academy, of­fers up to 500 foot­ballers aged six to 17 train­ing meth­ods from French cen­tres, in par­tic­u­lar the famed Na­tional Foot­ball In­sti­tute of Claire­fontaine that pro­duced World Cup win­ner Mbappe, among other elite foot­ballers.</p>
    <p>It charges stan­dard fees of $350 for goal­keep­ers and $500 for out­field­ers for a once-a-week term, which con­sists of eight train­ing ses­sions and four league games. Twice-a-week yearly pack­ages (six terms) that com­prise 96 train­ing ses­sions and 24 league games cost $3,420 for goal­keep­ers and $4,560 for out­field­ers.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the FFF set up a joint of­fice in Bei­jing and an academy in New York in re­cent years, a new foot­ball school in Sin­ga­pore rep­re­sents its de­sire to ex­pand its global reach.</p>
    <p>FFF pres­i­dent Noel le Graet said: “By wel­com­ing young Sin­ga­pore­ans to a new academy, the FFF con­tin­ues to strengthen its in­ter­na­tional pres­ence af­ter the open­ing of a sim­i­lar cen­tre in New York last year, our of­fice in China, and the con­tin­u­a­tion of our part­ner­ship with Ma­jor League Soc­cer in the United States.”</p>
