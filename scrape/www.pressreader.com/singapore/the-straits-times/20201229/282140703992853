    <p>Smart home hubs and Wi-Fi routers from lo­cal brands Aztech, HomeAuto So­lu­tions and Prolink are the first tech­nol­ogy prod­ucts to carry cy­ber-se­cu­rity la­bels sim­i­lar to the en­ergy-ef­fi­ciency la­bels on home ap­pli­ances.</p>
    <p>Sold on e-com­merce plat­forms such as Lazada and Shopee, four prod­ucts from these three brands have been given the Level 1 rat­ing un­der the Cy­ber­se­cu­rity La­belling Scheme (CLS), which is aimed at help­ing buy­ers gauge how ex­posed they are to risks.</p>
    <p>The Level 1 rat­ing means the de­vice maker has en­sured that there is a unique de­fault pass­word and that soft­ware up­dates are au­to­mat­i­cally pushed to the prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The CLS – a vol­un­tary tiered rat­ing sys­tem ad­min­is­tered by the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency of Sin­ga­pore (CSA) – was launched in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Checks by The Straits Times found that the prices of the four CLS-la­belled prod­ucts are com­pa­ra­ble to those of non-la­belled coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a sin­gle unit of the la­belled Wi-Fi router from Prolink costs $150, while one un­la­belled Wi-Fi router from TP-Link’s Deco X20 line is priced at $149.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have, how­ever, said that la­belled prod­ucts could cost markedly more – such as when, for a higher rat­ing, a man­u­fac­turer sends its prod­uct to an ex­ter­nal lab­o­ra­tory to test its re­sis­tance to cy­ber at­tacks.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause com­ply­ing with the re­quire­ments for higher rat­ings in­volve “sig­nif­i­cant ef­fort and re­sources”, said As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Goh Khim Yong from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s School of Com­put­ing.</p>
    <p>While some con­sumers said they would be will­ing to pay a small pre­mium for a more se­cure prod­uct, most i ndi­cated that they would pri­ori­tise other fac­tors such as user-friend­li­ness and re­li­a­bil­ity over cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen Shao Wei, 34, said he is more con­cerned with re­li­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“As far as I’m con­cerned, the stuff I buy should not break down,” said the tu­tor, who bought an Asus Wi-Fi router – which is not rated un­der the la­belling scheme – ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“Cy­ber se­cu­rity is not the main con­cern for me be­cause I’m not a per­son of high net worth and I don’t pos­sess any­thing wor­thy of ran­som,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers made the dis­tinc­tion be­tween “more crit­i­cal” prod­ucts and less crit­i­cal ones that do not war­rant as much cy­ber-se­cu­rity con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Se­bas­tian Chew, 32, said he pays ex­tra at­ten­tion to the cy­ber­se­cu­rity ca­pa­bil­i­ties of “crit­i­cal items” such as dig­i­tal door locks so as to avoid compromisi­ng the phys­i­cal safety of his home.</p>
    <p>But the civil ser­vant does not give as much thought to light switches, which he said would not be “life-threat­en­ing”.</p>
    <p>Ms Marisa Wei, 32, who works in sup­ply-chain plan­ning, is will­ing to pay a 10 per cent to 20 per cent pre­mium for a more se­cure prod­uct, hav­ing read hor­ror sto­ries about tech items be­ing com­pro­mised by hack­ers.</p>
    <p>But she would still baulk at huge mark-ups for a cer­ti­fied prod­uct.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Sudipta Chattopadh­yay, from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign’s In­for­ma­tion Systems Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign clus­ter, said con­sumers should con­sider get­ting a more se­cure model – with higher rat­ings – for prod­ucts that deal with sen­si­tive func­tions like pay­ments, or are crit­i­cal in a net­work and have ac­cess to pri­vate data.</p>
    <p>“A prod­uct that is con­sid­ered to be crit­i­cal may vary be­tween peo­ple... This is why I think it is im­por­tant for con­sumers to un­der­stand how they are go­ing to use the prod­uct and as­sess the risk,” said Prof Sudipta.</p>
    <p>Other ex­perts noted that more work is needed to pop­u­larise the la­belling ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Prof Goh said Sin­ga­pore does not have sig­nif­i­cant clout to in­flu­ence the de­vice man­u­fac­tur­ers’ prod­uct strate­gies as the market here is too small. This is why the CSA wants to work with Asean to in­crease its clout to get the ini­tia­tive “off the ground”.</p>
    <p>But he warned that even with the most se­cure hard­ware, con­sumers might still end up be­ing the last “weak­est link” by en­gag­ing in poor In­ter­net prac­tices such as click­ing on un­safe links.</p>
    <p>“This thus calls for some level of con­sumer ed­u­ca­tion on what these CLS la­bels do or do not do, and, of course, for con­sumers to up­grade their knowl­edge of safe cy­ber-se­cu­rity prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>IM­POR­TANT TO AS­SESS RISK</p>
