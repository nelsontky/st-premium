    <p>THE Straits Times In­dex (STI) fell 13.59 points or 0.53 per cent to 2,545.51 yes­ter­day, as US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s grow­ing at­tack on the Chi­nese tech sec­tor sent Asian stock indices lower, while pun­ters con­tin­ued to hope for a US stim­u­lus pack­age to keep the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery on track.</p>
    <p>Ms Ipek Ozkardeska­ya, se­nior an­a­lyst at Swis­squote Bank, said: “Trump pro­hib­ited US firms from do­ing busi­ness with the most pop­u­lar Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies TikTok and WeChat due to na­tional se­cu­rity is­sues. These ac­tions also aim to curb China’s ris­ing tech power and es­ca­late the cold war be­tween the two coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>The Hang Seng In­dex shed 1.6 per cent and the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite fell 0.96 per cent, while gold was headed for its best week since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. The Nikkei fell 0.39 per cent and the KLSE slipped 0.66 per cent.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s losses were not enough to wipe out ear­lier gains for lo­cal shares, and the STI ended the week up 15.69 points or 0.61 per cent. About 1.52 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.38 bil­lion changed hands, with losers out­num­ber­ing gainers 288 to 159.</p>
    <p>Thai Bev­er­age, the most ac­tive in­dex stock, fell two cents or 3.2 per cent to $0.605.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the week, UOB Kay Hian added Thai Bev­er­age to its al­pha picks. The spir­its maker trades at 16.3 times its ex­pected earn­ings for FY20, be­low its five-year mean price-to-earn­ings ra­tio of 20 times, the bro­ker­age said, adding: “We see re­silient con­sump­tion vol­umes from its off-trade spir­its seg­ment, which could shel­ter the group from the full-blown ef­fects of Covid-19 even if a sub­se­quent round of stay­home mea­sure ma­te­ri­alises. We also high­light that in­dus­try data for</p>
    <p>Thai­land do­mes­tic sales of white spir­its was up 8.5 per cent year-onyear in the June quar­ter.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, DBS an­a­lysts wrote: “Watch out for op­por­tu­ni­ties in the un­der­val­ued cycli­cal space as sev­eral are trad­ing at his­toric val­u­a­tion ex­tremes. While there is a lack of strong up­side cat­a­lyst, we be­lieve the cur­rent lull pe­riod for these stocks is an op­por­tu­nity to ac­cu­mu­late. Our picks are Cap­i­taLand, City De­vel­op­ments, Com­fortDel­gro, ThaiBev and OCBC.”</p>
    <p>Top gainer Jar­dine Mathe­son rose 1.24 per cent to US$40.80. Top loser Sin­ga­pore Ex­change fell 2.48 per cent to $8.64.</p>
    <p>The earn­ings re­port­ing sea­son con­tin­ues in full swing next week: Wil­mar will re­port half-year earn­ings af­ter trad­ing on Tues­day. Ci­tyDev and UOL Group will re­port earn­ings on Thursday, and ST Engi­neer­ing will re­port on Fri­day.</p>
