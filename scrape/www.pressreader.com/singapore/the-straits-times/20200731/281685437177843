    <p>Four new coro­n­avirus pa­tients in the com­mu­nity an­nounced yes­ter­day are linked to the Covid-19 clus­ter at the Bukit Pan­jang In­te­grated Trans­port Hub, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The clus­ter, first an­nounced last Fri­day, now has eight pa­tients, with yes­ter­day’s up­date. The four new pa­tients are a Sin­ga­porean and three work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>They were asymp­to­matic and de­tected as part of proac­tive case find­ing of peo­ple work­ing in a new work­place clus­ter that has emerged.</p>
    <p>All four tested pos­i­tive on Wednes­day, but test re­sults showed they likely con­tracted the in­fec­tions in the past and were no longer in­fec­tious, said MOH.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, MOH is work­ing with the Land Trans­port Author­ity to ar­range for close con­tacts of the four new pa­tients to be tested.</p>
    <p>The ear­lier four pa­tients linked to the trans­port hub clus­ter were all bus driv­ers, trans­port op­er­a­tor SMRT said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a FairPrice out­let, Wat­sons, the My Briyani House eatery and Mc­Don­ald’s in Hil­lion Mall, which is linked to the trans­port hub, were added to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Mr Teh Tarik deli within the trans­port hub was also added to the list, along with depart­ment store myCK at 478 Tampines Street 44, Cause­way Point and Al-Sahira Restau­rant at 200 Jalan Sul­tan.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>Four new im­ported Covid-19 cases were also an­nounced yes­ter­day, com­pris­ing three work pass hold­ers and one work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>The three work pass hold­ers are em­ployed here and had ar­rived from In­dia be­tween July 15 and 18.</p>
    <p>The work per­mit holder ar­rived from In­done­sia on July 18.</p>
    <p>All of them were placed on 14-day stay-home notices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were serv­ing their notices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>They had been tested while serv­ing the notices, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 270 of the 278 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 51,809.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from nine cases two weeks ago to three in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of five cases to one over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from nine cases two weeks ago to three in the past week.</p>
