    <p>While Covid-19 might have dented the food and bev­er­age busi­ness last year, eater­ies en­joyed a burst of ac­tiv­ity last month, with more book­ings made com­pared with a year ago. Food and bev­er­age play­ers said it re­flects a re­cov­ery in con­sumer con­fi­dence and is likely a re­sult of Covid-19 af­fect­ing year-end plans, in­clud­ing travel.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 might have dented the food and bev­er­age busi­ness last year, eater­ies en­joyed a burst of ac­tiv­ity last month, with more book­ings made com­pared with a year ago be­fore the pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>Food and bev­er­age play­ers said it re­flects a re­cov­ery in con­sumer con­fi­dence and is likely a re­sult of Covid-19 af­fect­ing year-end plans, in­clud­ing travel.</p>
    <p>This also comes as peo­ple were al­lowed to eat out in larger groups of up to eight af­ter phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s reopening kicked in last Mon­day. The pre­vi­ous limit was five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial fig­ures for last month are not avail­able yet but din­ing book­ing web­site Chope Sin­ga­pore said reser­va­tions jumped 41 per cent last month from a year ago.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows from a trend that the site saw from Septem­ber un­til the year end where last year’s book­ings ex­ceeded 2019 reser­va­tions. Book­ings also rose 36 per cent on av­er­age from Septem­ber to last month.</p>
    <p>Chope’s gen­eral man­ager Jean Wee said this hap­pened at a time when peo­ple were look­ing for­ward to year-end fes­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The fourth quar­ter tends to be an ac­tive quar­ter for us, and last year was no dif­fer­ent, par­tic­u­larly with con­sumer con­fi­dence re­turn­ing and in­creased de­mand post-cir­cuit breaker,” she noted, re­fer­ring to the two-month pe­riod to curb the spread of Covid-19 that started in early April.</p>
    <p>Eatery op­er­a­tors said pan­demic travel curbs could have driven some cus­tomers to their out­lets.</p>
    <p>Si Chuan Dou Hua restau­rants’ direc­tor of restau­rants, bars and events Linda Loke said 70 per cent of its eater­ies were full last month.</p>
    <p>“Book­ings this year seem to be faster than the last and book­ings have been made ear­lier,” she said.</p>
    <p>“This is prob­a­bly due to the fact that peo­ple are not go­ing to be trav­el­ling as much.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ricky Ng, owner of Blue Lo­tus Chi­nese Eat­ing House and Opio Kitchen and Bar, said his restau­rants re­ceived more reser­va­tions for the year-end pe­riod com­pared with the year be­fore.</p>
    <p>He be­lieves this is likely due to fewer New Year’s Eve ac­tiv­i­ties dur­ing the pan­demic, which led to more peo­ple choos­ing to cel­e­brate at eater­ies in­stead.</p>
    <p>To cush­ion the pan­demic im­pact, some eater­ies are do­ing more pro­mo­tions, which might have propped up busi­ness.</p>
    <p>While lat­est gov­ern­ment fig­ures show that F&B ser­vice sales were up 5.6 per cent in Oc­to­ber ver­sus Septem­ber, Oc­to­ber sales were still down 23.5 per cent from a year ago.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Tjioe, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Tung Lok Group, which owns Asian and Western restau­rants, said that in the past, Chi­nese out­lets did not put much ef­fort into pro­mot­ing Christ­mas busi­ness “as we thought cus­tomers would pre­fer to dine at Western restau­rants or ho­tels”.</p>
    <p>But last year, his Chi­nese restau­rants rolled out Christ­mas and New Year’s Eve menus due to set­backs from the pan­demic and was “sur­prised the take-up was so high”.</p>
    <p>“(The year be­fore), we re­ceived many can­cel­la­tions when Covid-19 was new. The sen­ti­ments are dif­fer­ent now be­cause of the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and Sin­ga­pore­ans are more familiar with Covid-19,” he said.</p>
    <p>Still, a spokesman for the Restau­rant As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore said out­lets may seem full be­cause, with safe man­age­ment mea­sures still in place in phase three, F&B busi­nesses are not op­er­at­ing at full ca­pac­ity for dine-in cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures, such as hav­ing 1m dis­tanc­ing be­tween groups of din­ers, mean restau­rants can­not ac­cept more cus­tomers on their premises than be­fore the pan­demic. This also makes it harder for walk-in cus­tomers to get a seat.</p>
    <p>It could also ex­plain why more peo­ple are mak­ing book­ings, said eatery op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>With more din­ers stream­ing in, restau­rants are tak­ing steps to pro­vide a safe and en­joy­able ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Carousel at Royal Plaza on Scotts in­stalled sneeze guards at open kitchens to pre­vent con­tam­i­na­tion and fre­quently sani­tises high touch­points – such as counter tops, ta­bles and chairs – with hospi­tal-grade dis­in­fec­tant.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant also in­creased its man­power by 30 per cent to cater to more din­ers.</p>
    <p>The year-end surge could still have a ben­e­fi­cial ef­fect at the start of this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Wee said the first quar­ter of the year tends to be slower reser­va­tions-wise, bar­ring peaks around Chi­nese New Year (CNY) and Valen­tine’s Day.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, with leisure travel curbed for now, con­sumers are look­ing for out­lets for in­dul­gence, and din­ing is one thing that can evoke travel, but also con­tin­ues to be a mean­ing­ful way to con­nect even in dif­fi­cult times,” she added.</p>
    <p>Some restau­rants are al­ready see­ing CNY reser­va­tions stream­ing in.</p>
    <p>Si Chuan Dou Hua said 70 per cent of its restau­rants are full for CNY next month.</p>
    <p>Good­wood Park Ho­tel said its Min Jiang restau­rants at the ho­tel and in Dempsey are al­most fully booked on Chi­nese New Year’s Eve.</p>
    <p>Reser­va­tions are also com­ing in quickly for the first two days of CNY.</p>
    <p>Carousel is 90 per cent filled on Chi­nese New Year’s Eve and is 50 per cent booked for the rest of the fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>For pri­vate-hire driver Adrian Ang, 38, not be­ing able to go abroad has seen his fam­ily cel­e­brat­ing his father’s 70th birth­day at a restau­rant to “have a nice, grand meal to­gether”.</p>
    <p>He booked a din­ner for eight to mark the event with his fam­ily at a Si Chuan Dou Hua restau­rant last Tues­day. “Since it’s a birth­day cel­e­bra­tion, I waited for Sin­ga­pore to en­ter phase three so that we could have eight peo­ple at the ta­ble.”</p>
    <p>CHANGE IN RISK AP­PETITE</p>
    <p>(The year be­fore), we re­ceived many can­cel­la­tions when Covid-19 was new. The sen­ti­ments are dif­fer­ent now be­cause of the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and Sin­ga­pore­ans are more familiar with Covid-19.</p>
