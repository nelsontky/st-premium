    <p>ROME Play­ers from Roma and Fiorentina have been barred from leav­ing the coun­try by lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to play in up­com­ing in­ter­na­tional games be­cause of Covid-19 in­fec­tions at the two Serie A clubs, Ital­ian me­dia re­ported on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Ansa news agency said play­ers from Fiorentina would not be al­lowed to travel af­ter the club an­nounced on Fri­day that Spain for­ward Jose Calle­jon had tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus .</p>
    <p>It said the or­der had come from the lo­cal re­gional au­thor­ity ASL in Tus­cany which had told the en­tire Fiorentina squad to self-iso­late at their homes for 10 days, ex­cept to go to and from train­ing.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian daily Gazzetta dello Sport said that a sim­i­lar or­der had been made by the lo­cal health au­thor­ity in Rome fol­low­ing Roma and Bos­nia and Herze­gov­ina skip­per Edin Dzeko’s pos­i­tive test.</p>
    <p>Fiorentina were re­ported as hav­ing 13 play­ers called up for in­ter­na­tional duty, in­clud­ing Erick Pul­gar (Chile), So­fyan Am­ra­bat (Morocco) and Ser­bian pair Nikola Milenkovic and Du­san Vla­hovic.</p>
    <p>Ser­bia host Scot­land in a Euro 2020 play-off on Thurs­day while Chile face Peru and Venezuela in World Cup qual­i­fiers over the next 10 days.</p>
    <p>Roma play­ers who could be af­fected in­clude Al­ba­nia de­fender Marash Kum­bulla, Ar­me­nia for­ward Hen­rikh Mkhi­taryan and sev­eral Italy in­ter­na­tion­als. Nei­ther club have com­mented, but web­site Foot­ball Italia said Serie A ri­vals Genoa, Lazio, Sas­suolo and In­ter Mi­lan were also sub­jected to the same travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In­ter direc­tor Beppe Marotta hit out at the lack of trans­parency, say­ing yes­ter­day: “This sit­u­a­tion is cre­at­ing in­equal­ity, so I de­mand that the Min­is­ter for Sport (Vin­cenzo) Spadafora in­ter­venes.</p>
    <p>“It al­ters the reg­u­lar­ity of var­i­ous tour­na­ments. I find it ab­surd that the ASL in dif­fer­ent re­gions act dif­fer­ently, from Rome to Mi­lan to Florence. There are pro­to­cols, but there is also this grey area cre­ated by the lack of any cen­tral or­gan­i­sa­tion. Ev­ery ASL then be­comes cru­cial to the for­tunes of the club. This makes my rais­ing the alarm even more im­por­tant, as I said a few days ago that we had to pro­tect play­ers from in­jury on in­ter­na­tional duty.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Ital­ian Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion is con­tin­u­ing to in­ves­ti­gate Lazio af­ter Ciro Im­mo­bile, Lu­cas Leiva and Thomas Strakosha were part of the squad that beat Torino on Nov 1 de­spite the trio be­ing barred from play­ing in Cham­pi­ons League games ei­ther side of that Serie A fix­ture be­cause of pos­i­tive Covid-19 tests. Ac­cord­ing to lo­cal daily Il Cor­riere dello Sport, the pres­i­dent of club lab­o­ra­tory Fu­tura Di­ag­nos­tica has been named as a sus­pect by the Fed­eral Pros­e­cu­tor’s Of­fice over the dif­fer­ing swab tests done by Uefa and the ones sub­mit­ted by Lazio.</p>
