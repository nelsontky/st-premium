    <p>The road to mak­ing In­dian film The Dis­ci­ple be­gan with writer- di­rec­tor Chai­tanya Tamhane’s fas­ci­na­tion with Hin­dus­tani clas­si­cal mu­sic.</p>
    <p>For In­dia-born Sin­ga­porean pro­ducer Vivek Gomber, it in­volved go­ing out with Tamhane at odd hours.</p>
    <p>“I had to at­tend con­certs at 7am be­cause some mu­sic can be per­formed only in the morn­ing,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>As the film shows, cen­turies of tra­di­tion dic­tate what can be played when.</p>
    <p>Mum­bai-based Tamhane, 33,</p>
    <p>“fell in love” with a mu­si­cal form that he, like many in In­dia, had known su­per­fi­cially, says friend and long-time artis­tic col­lab­o­ra­tor Gomber.</p>
    <p>He tells The Straits Times over the tele­phone from Mum­bai: “A few years ago, he grew cu­ri­ous about the mu­sic and be­gan go­ing to con­certs and got at­tracted to the whole scene.”</p>
    <p>From there, the idea of a film grew.</p>
    <p>Os­car-win­ning film-maker Al­fonso Cuaron (the drama Roma, 2018; science-fic­tion epic Grav­ity, 2013) signed on as an ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>He be­came friends with Tamhane fol­low­ing a 2016 men­tor­ship pro­gramme spon­sored by watch­maker Rolex, which paired the younger man with the 59-yearold Mex­i­can film-maker.</p>
    <p>“We shared a fi­nal cut of the film with Cuaron. He l oved it and wanted to be a part of it,” Gomber, 41, says.</p>
    <p>Known in Sin­ga­pore as an ac­tor ac­tive in lo­cal theatre, Gomber has starred in works such as drama se­ries A Suit­able Boy (2020), which is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>He also had a role in Tamhane’s fea­ture de­but, the drama Court (2014), which won Best Asian Fea­ture at the 2014 Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val and the Venice Hori­zons Award at the Venice Film Fes­ti­val the same year.</p>
    <p>But in the award-win­ning The Dis­ci­ple, which is show­ing ex­clu­sively at The Pro­jec­tor, he acted as pro­ducer.</p>
    <p>Born in Jaipur, Gomber and his fam­ily moved here when he was 10. He trav­els be­tween Mum­bai and Sin­ga­pore for work and leisure.</p>
    <p>He has been work­ing with Tamhane for more than a decade.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, The Dis­ci­ple was the first In­dian work to com­pete at the Venice Film Fes­ti­val since 2001, when the drama Mon­soon Wed­ding was se­lected. At the same fes­ti­val, it also picked up the Best Screen­play prize and was nom­i­nated for the Golden Lion, the high­est prize there.</p>
    <p>Just as Court im­mersed view­ers in In­dian le­gal cul­ture, The Dis­ci­ple dives into the re­la­tion­ships be­tween clas­si­cal mu­si­cians and those who or­bit them, such as con­cert pro­mot­ers, mu­sic pro­duc­ers, wealthy pa­trons and, most specif­i­cally, the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Sharad is the dis­ci­ple of the film played by Aditya Mo­dak, and the mas­ter, or Gu­ruji, is played by singer Arun Dravid.</p>
    <p>The story, Gomber says, plays on the fear lurk­ing at the back of the mind of ev­ery artist, that years of hard work and sac­ri­fice mean noth­ing if one lacks the “it” fac­tor that sets stars apart from the rest.</p>
    <p>Tamhane’s ap­pre­ci­a­tion of Hin­dus­tani clas­si­cal mu­sic in­cludes be­ing thor­ough about the cul­ture sur­round­ing it, Gomber adds. The di­rec­tor trav­elled across In­dia in­ter­view­ing mu­si­cians and aca­demics be­fore writ­ing the screen­play.</p>
    <p>Film­ing took place mostly in Mum­bai in 2018.</p>
    <p>Shoot­ing in the city was one of the most chal­leng­ing things he had done, Gomber says.</p>
    <p>He was present on the set ev­ery day. Be­cause of how crowded streets can be, a lot of time and money were spent on crowd and traf­fic con­trol.</p>
    <p>“It’s ex­pen­sive, it’s scary,” he says. “But some­times, that is why you do some­thing. Be­cause it scares you. It’s ex­cit­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Dis­ci­ple is show­ing ex­clu­sively at The Pro­jec­tor.</p>
