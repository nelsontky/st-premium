    <p>Chil­dren un­der the age of six will no longer be legally re­quired to wear a face mask, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It will amend the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) (Con­trol Or­der) Reg­u­la­tions 2020 next Mon­day to up­date the le­gal min­i­mum age for chil­dren to wear masks to six years old and above, up from the cur­rent two years old and above.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said: “To pro­tect young chil­dren from Covid-19, we con­tinue to en­cour­age young chil­dren to wear a mask or a face shield, es­pe­cially if they are in a group set­ting, for ex­am­ple, in pre-school or when they are in so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties in­ter­act­ing with other kids.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Chil­dren and other per­sons who may not have the co­or­di­na­tion nec­es­sary for the proper use of masks or face shields should con­tinue to be su­per­vised.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Mak said Sin­ga­pore is bring­ing its guide­lines in align­ment with those of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) and United Na­tions In­ter­na­tional Chil­dren’s Emer­gency Fund (Unicef).</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional agen­cies re­cently is­sued an ad­vi­sory that chil­dren aged five and un­der should not be re­quired to wear masks.</p>
    <p>“This is based on the safety and over­all in­ter­est of the child and the ca­pac­ity to ap­pro­pri­ately use a mask with min­i­mal as­sis­tance,” the agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>Their ad­vi­sory comes af­ter an in­ter­na­tional and multi-dis­ci­plinary ex­pert group re­viewed ev­i­dence on Covid-19 dis­ease and trans­mis­sion in chil­dren and the lim­ited avail</p>
    <p>able ev­i­dence on the use of masks by chil­dren. They also based their guid­ance on other fac­tors such as chil­dren’s psy­choso­cial needs and de­vel­op­men­tal mile­stones.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak told a press con­fer­ence that ex­ist­ing guide­lines al­ready al­low flex­i­bil­ity on mask use for younger chil­dren, as chil­dren aged 12 and be­low can use a face shield in place of a mask, con­sis­tent with</p>
    <p>these rec­om­men­da­tions. “But we haven’t re­ally fully re­flected that in our cur­rent laws, and we are mak­ing some ad­just­ments,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, large cin­ema halls with more than 300 seats will also be al­lowed to ad­mit up to 150 pa­trons in three sep­a­rate zones of 50 pa­trons each from Oct 1. Other smaller cin­ema halls will be al­lowed to in­crease their ca­pac­ity to 50 per</p>
    <p>cent of their orig­i­nal op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity or main­tain the cur­rent limit of up to 50 pa­trons per hall, sub­ject to safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas had pre­vi­ously been al­lowed to open with the 50-pa­tron limit and a 1m so­cial dis­tanc­ing seat­ing con­fig­u­ra­tion on July 13, af­ter hav­ing been closed since March 27.</p>
