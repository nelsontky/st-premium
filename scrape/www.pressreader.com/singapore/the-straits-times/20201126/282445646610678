    <p>PARIS • In an un­usu­ally crammed sea­son, the Europa League, which re­sumes to­day with 24 group games, presents clubs fight­ing for do­mes­tic glory with a tricky bal­anc­ing act.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham, Real So­ciedad and AC Mi­lan – the English, Ital­ian and Span­ish league lead­ers re­spec­tively – as well as Bun­desliga high­fly­ers Bayer Lev­erkusen, have all slipped up al­ready in Europe’s sec­ond-tier com­pe­ti­tion and can­not af­ford an­other mis­take.</p>
    <p>Yet the de­mands of a con­densed sea­son mean the teams are walk­ing two tightropes at once.</p>
    <p>So­ciedad lost vet­eran David Silva to a ham­string in­jury last Sun­day ahead of their trip to Group F lead­ers AZ Alk­maar.</p>
    <p>Yet even as they travel to the Nether­lands, they need to plan for Sun­day’s cru­cial game against Vil­lar­real, who are third in the Span­ish La Liga.</p>
    <p>Their only con­so­la­tion is that their La Liga ri­vals must cross the Mediter­ranean twice to visit sec­ond-placed Mac­cabi Tel Aviv of Is­rael in Group I.</p>
    <p>Spurs lead Group J on goal dif­fer­ence in head-to-head games ahead of Bel­gium’s An­twerp and Aus­trian out­fit Lask.</p>
    <p>They lost key cen­tre-back Toby Alder­weireld, who suf­fered a groin mus­cle in­jury in the league win over Manch­ester City on Saturday.</p>
    <p>Man­ager Jose Mour­inho came un­stuck when he ro­tated his squad in An­twerp last month and lost.</p>
    <p>Yet with a visit to third-placed Chelsea in the Pre­mier League on Sun­day, he may again rest play­ers against win­less Lu­do­gorets.</p>
    <p>That could give Gareth Bale a chance to score his first Europa League goal since March 2013, when Spurs elim­i­nated In­ter Mi­lan in the last 16.</p>
    <p>Mi­lan travel to Lille seek­ing not just a vic­tory that would put them top of Group H, but also re­venge af­ter los­ing 3-0 to the Ligue 1 side at the San Siro. They are with­out tal­is­man Zla­tan Ibrahi­movic, who is out with a thigh in­jury.</p>
    <p>Only four teams – Vil­lar­real, Le­ices­ter, Arse­nal and Hof­fen­heim – have won all three matches. All can en­sure a top-two fin­ish to­day and give them­selves the chance to rest play­ers in the last two rounds.</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners will travel to Nor­way to face Molde, sec­ond in Group B. Mikel Arteta’s men are stum­bling in the Pre­mier League, hav­ing failed to score from open play in five games, and will be with­out the in­jured Wil­lian, Bukayo Saka and Thomas Partey.</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed El­neny and Sead Ko­lasinac are still re­cov­er­ing from Covid-19, but the Arse­nal man­ager said his side will go in search of the away win.</p>
    <p>“We have an in­cred­i­ble amount of games com­ing up,” said the Spa­niard. “Ev­ery team is go­ing to face chal­lenges with the amount of fix­tures we have. We will put out a team to com­pete.”</p>
