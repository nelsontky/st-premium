    <p>• French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said his coun­try is fight­ing “Is­lamist sep­a­ratism, never Is­lam”, in re­sponse to a Fi­nan­cial Times ar­ti­cle that he claimed mis­quoted him and has since been re­moved from the news­pa­per’s web­site.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to the edi­tor pub­lished on Wed­nes­day, Mr Macron said the Bri­tish pa­per had ac­cused him of “stig­ma­tis­ing French Mus­lims for elec­toral pur­poses and of fos­ter­ing a cli­mate of fear and sus­pi­cion to­wards them”.</p>
    <p>“I will not al­low any­body to claim that France, or its gov­ern­ment, is fos­ter­ing racism against Mus­lims,” he said.</p>
    <p>An opin­ion piece by an FT cor­re­spon­dent pub­lished on Mon­day al­leged that Mr Macron’s con­dem­na­tion of “Is­lamic sep­a­ratism” risked fos­ter­ing a “hos­tile en­vi­ron­ment” for French Mus­lims. The ar­ti­cle was later re­moved on­line and re­placed with a no­tice say­ing it “con­tained fac­tual er­rors”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, while vis­it­ing France’s bor­der with Spain, Mr Macron called for a strength­en­ing of bor­der con­trols in the European Union’s Schen­gen zone fol­low­ing re­cent Is­lamist at­tacks in France and Aus­tria. The tighter con­trols would tar­get il­le­gal im­mi­gra­tion amid “a grow­ing ter­ror­ism threat”, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron sparked protests across the Mus­lim world af­ter last month’s mur­der of teacher Sa­muel Paty – who had shown his class a car­toon of Prophet Muham­mad – by say­ing France would never re­nounce its laws per­mit­ting blas­phe­mous car­i­ca­tures.</p>
    <p>Is­lam for­bids de­pic­tions of Prophet Muham­mad.</p>
    <p>Af­ter protests and boy­cotts of French goods across parts of the world, Mr Macron told me­dia last week he un­der­stood the car­i­ca­tures could be shock­ing for some.</p>
    <p>But he warned in his let­ter this week that there were still “breed­ing grounds” for ex­trem­ism in his coun­try. “This is what France is fight­ing against... ha­tred and death that threaten its chil­dren – never against Is­lam.”</p>
