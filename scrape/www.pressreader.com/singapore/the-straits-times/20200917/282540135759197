    <p>THE PER­SONAL HIS­TORY OF DAVID COP­PER­FIELD</p>
    <p>The in­fec­tiously joy­ful The Per­sonal His­tory Of David Cop­per­field of­fers a rare com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors: beau­ti­ful di­a­logue spo­ken by good ac­tors; edit­ing that makes the two-hour film feel like 60 min­utes; and a sto­ry­telling style that feels mod­ern and meta while stay­ing true to – and sin­cerely in love with – its source ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>The work comes from Bri­tish film-maker Armando Ian­nucci, best known for acid-etched por­traits of po­lit­i­cal fig­ures (BBC se­ries The Thick Of It, 2005 to 2012; HBO se­ries Veep, 2012 to 2019).</p>
    <p>But when he is not mak­ing par­o­dies of pol­i­tics or so­ci­ety, he is also a Dick­en­sophile, hav­ing writ­ten and pre­sented a doc­u­men­tary on the English writer in 2012, Armando’s Tale Of Charles Dick­ens.</p>
    <p>“The true Dick­en­sian world is our world,” says Ian­nucci in the doc­u­men­tary (avail­able on YouTube).</p>
    <p>To that end, he has cast Bri­tish-In­dian ac­tor Dev Pa­tel in the ti­tle role. Other mi­nor­ity-race ac­tors are sprin­kled through­out.</p>
    <p>It’s a sign of faith in sto­ry­telling and act­ing, that race will not mat­ter if the world is im­mer­sive.</p>
    <p>And it is. The story be­gins with the ti­tle char­ac­ter as a child (Jairaj Varsani) and, in a se­ries of vi­gnettes, fol­lows the older David (Pa­tel) as he grows from ne­glected child to an abused one, and to his meet­ing with his saviour, rich aunt</p>
    <p>Bet­sey Trot­wood (Tilda Swin­ton), her ec­cen­tric lodger Mr Dick (Hugh Lau­rie), her lawyer Mr Wick­field (Benedict Wong), the penu­ri­ous but peppy Mr Mi­caw­ber (Peter Ca­paldi) and more. Ben Whishaw de­liv­ers a mas­ter­ful per­for­mance as the unc­tu­ous Uriah Heep.</p>
    <p>The movie’s the­atri­cal look is ex­plained by its fram­ing de­vice: It is Cop­per­field him­self, at a later, more suc­cess­ful stage of his life, telling his story to a live au­di­ence. It takes no ef­fort to see Dick­ens in David’s place – the au­thor, after all, mod­elled parts of the story on his own life.</p>
    <p>But with just a lit­tle stretch, one can also see Ian­nucci on stage, ask­ing view­ers if he has con­vinced us of the ge­nius of the writer’s work. He has.</p>
    <p>DE­LIVER US FROM EVIL</p>
    <p>This film is the lat­est in a se­ries of tense, vi­o­lent crime thrillers from South Korea, which in re­cent times has de­liv­ered high-qual­ity stories fea­tur­ing dead-eyed killers and charis­matic losers.</p>
    <p>If this story has a Western vibe, it is be­cause it fea­tures a show­down in a city that has be­come Asian cin­ema’s stand-in for Mex­ico: Bangkok. It is where tri­ads, yakuza (Ja­panese or­gan­ised crime), gun-run­ners and drug deal­ers of all na­tions come to do bat­tle – at least in films.</p>
    <p>Hired gun In-Nam (Hwang Jung-min) heads to the Thai cap­i­tal to fix a vex­ing fam­ily prob­lem. Hot on his heels and seek­ing re­venge is Ray (Lee Jung-jae), a South Korean crime boss with a pen­chant for tor­ture. The stage is set for a stylish, sav­age match-up that has sur­pris­ingly ten­der fam­ily mo­ments.</p>
    <p>I’M LIVIN IT</p>
    <p>A few years ago, the case of a Hong Kong “McRefugee” made head­lines here. Among the many home­less folk stay­ing overnight in one of the city’s 24-hour fast-food restau­rant out­lets was a Sin­ga­porean who had dis­ap­peared years ago.</p>
    <p>In this drama set in the com­mu­nity of ta­ble sleep­ers, Bowen (Aaron Kwok) is a big brother fig­ure of one such group. Through his eyes, the story in­tro­duces each mem­ber of the en­sem­ble, in­clud­ing an un­doc­u­mented mi­grant from China (Cya Liu), an older man with de­men­tia (Alex Man) and a video-game ad­dict (Zeno Koo) flee­ing a dis­rup­tive home.</p>
    <p>First-time fea­ture di­rec­tor Wong Hing Fan has earned a brace of well-de­served fes­ti­val awards for this en­gag­ing, if heav­ily ro­man­ti­cised, por­trait of a tragic so­cial phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>It is a pity that the film is seen through the eyes of heart-throb Kwok’s failed fi­nancier and his love in­ter­est, the faded songstress Jane (Miriam Ye­ung), in­stead of through those of the far more in­ter­est­ing sup­port­ing char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>BEAUTY WATER</p>
    <p>The sec­ond South Korean film open­ing this week is an­i­mated hor­ror fea­ture Beauty Water, a cau­tion­ary tale about the preda­tory cos­met­ics in­dus­try and its ac­com­plice, an en­ter­tain­ment com­plex that treats tal­ent as dis­pos­able units.</p>
    <p>Ye-ji (voiced by Moon Nam-sook) is a make-up artist who bears wit­ness to the worst habits of the tele­vi­sion busi­ness, yet yearns to be as doll-like as the stars with whom she works – if only to be more vis­i­ble in a so­ci­ety that erases the ex­is­tence of women who are con­sid­ered unattrac­tive.</p>
    <p>While this movie has its heart in the right place and of­fers strong scares – the lo­tion of the ti­tle is a mon­key’s paw that makes dreams come true as it ex­tracts a ter­ri­ble price – the story re­lies too much on shock value to make its point.</p>
    <p>How­ever, events build up to a trippy, off-the-rails night­mare cli­max that will de­light fans of David Cro­nen­berg-style body hor­ror.</p>
    <p>AKU TAHU KAPAN KAMU MATI</p>
    <p>An­other hor­ror work open­ing this week but not re­viewed is from In­done­sia. In Aku Tahu Kapan Kamu Mati, Siena (Natasha Wilona) awakes from an ill­ness with the abil­ity to see a de­mon that ap­pears to a per­son who is about to die.</p>
    <p>She tries to rid her­self of this hor­ri­fy­ing gift before the evil spirit marks her as the next vic­tim.</p>
