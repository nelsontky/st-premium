    <p>Sin­ga­pore has made ar­range­ments with mul­ti­ple Covid-19 vac­cine mak­ers to en­sure it “will not be last in the queue” once doses are avail­able, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>He also ob­served that Asian coun­tries have had greater success than their Western coun­ter­parts in get­ting their peo­ple to com­ply with pan­demic mea­sures, in an in­ter­view with Bloomberg News aired yes­ter­day for its New Econ­omy Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>Asked by Bloomberg editor-inchief John Mick­leth­wait if smaller coun­tries have to worry about ob­tain­ing a vac­cine amid world­wide de­mand, PM Lee said it was a re­al­ity that larger coun­tries would “get some of their way” in en­sur­ing they top the wait­ing list.</p>
    <p>“It is a pity be­cause the WHO (World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion) makes a very valid point that the best way to get Covid-19 un­der con­trol is to have a ra­tio­nal scheme of pri­or­i­ties to dis­trib­ute the vac­cine to the places where it will make the most dif­fer­ence to the out­break,” he said. “But to op­ti­mise that, on a global scale (of) around 200 coun­tries, I think is go­ing to be very hard.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has formed a com­mit­tee to pri­ori­tise those who should re­ceive the vac­cine be­fore oth­ers when it is rolled out by the com­pa­nies which it is en­gaged in talks with.</p>
    <p>They in­clude phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal gi­ant Pfizer – which has an­nounced its vac­cine as 90 per cent ef­fec­tive – and the joint ef­fort by sci­en­tists at Sin­ga­pore’s Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and US firm Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics, which ex­pects to ship its ini­tial batch in the first three months of next year.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he is con­fi­dent a num­ber of vac­cine can­di­dates would pass muster, and that th­ese would, in a few years’ time, be ex­ten­sively avail­able and much more af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>“But I do not think you would have fin­ished pro­tect­ing the world’s pop­u­la­tion within the next year,” he said. “Fur­ther­more, you are not sure what risks and prob­lems may arise. We have to learn as we feel our way for­ward.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee was also quizzed on why Asia has reined in the pan­demic bet­ter than oth­ers, with Mr Mick­leth­wait con­trast­ing hun­dreds of deaths per mil­lion peo­ple in the United States, Bri­tain and Ger­many with sin­gle-digit fig­ures in Sin­ga­pore and China.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said pop­u­la­tions in Asia co­op­er­ated with wear­ing masks or prac­tis­ing safe dis­tanc­ing, com­pared with the Euro­peans or Amer­i­cans “where af­ter some time you are fed up and tired of be­ing locked down, and there is a push back... You want to go out and let your hair down and have a drink and have a rave”.</p>
    <p>But he also ac­knowl­edged that Sin­ga­pore has been lucky. “We have quite an el­derly pop­u­la­tion, so if there had been many com­mu­nity cases, I think we would have had a large num­ber of ca­su­al­ties and deaths too.”</p>
    <p>With the vast ma­jor­ity of cases cir­cu­lat­ing in­stead in the mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries, Sin­ga­pore has worked to con­fine the spread, give med­i­cal treat­ment to the work­ers, and keep them and the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion safe, said the Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He said the chal­lenge for Sin­ga­pore now is to find a way to re­open its bor­ders to busi­ness and tourism flows, while man­ag­ing the in­evitable im­port and in­tro­duc­tion of the coro­n­avirus into the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“If you are a coun­try like China, you can de­cide to close all your en­try points prac­ti­cally and be in splen­did iso­la­tion for quite some time with­out much dif­fi­culty,” said PM Lee. “But for Sin­ga­pore, that is go­ing to be very tough.”</p>
