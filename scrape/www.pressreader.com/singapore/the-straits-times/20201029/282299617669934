    <p>LIVER­POOL • Wary of in­juries and with one eye on West Ham, Jur­gen Klopp rang the changes as he chose to leave his “Fab Three” of Mo­hamed Salah, Sa­dio Mane and Roberto Firmino on the bench for Tues­day’s Cham­pi­ons League Group D game against Midtjyl­land.</p>
    <p>The Dan­ish min­nows put on a man­ful dis­play at An­field but were even­tu­ally beaten 2-0 by Liver­pool through Diogo Jota and a Salah penalty in added time.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the vic­tory came at a cost, with Klopp suf­fer­ing another in­jury blow af­ter Fabinho joined long-term ab­sen­tee Vir­gil van Dijk on the side­lines.</p>
    <p>The Brazil mid­fielder, who has been fill­ing in for the Dutch cen­tre­back since his se­ri­ous knee in­jury in the Oct 17 Mersey­side derby against Ever­ton, had to be sub­sti­tuted in the first half af­ter pick­ing up a mus­cle prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Rhys Wil­liams, 19, came on in his place and Klopp re­vealed that Joel Matip, who has missed the past three games with a leg prob­lem, was un­likely to be fit for Saturday’s Premier League home game with the Ham­mers. This l eaves J oe Gomez as their likely only avail­able recog­nised se­nior cen­tre-back.</p>
    <p>“It’s ex­actly the last thing we needed,” Klopp said of Fabinho’s in­jury. “I know he felt a ham­string, and that’s not good. He said he could have played on but no sprints, which doesn’t help.</p>
    <p>“We will see, we will know more af­ter a scan but clearly it isn’t good.</p>
    <p>“Fab, I don’t know. Mus­cle in­juries are like this, you get the re­sult to­mor­row morn­ing prob­a­bly, we have to wait for that.</p>
    <p>“It was a tough night. It’s a bit like in a mar­riage, there are good and bad times. It’s not a bad time but it’s a tricky time, 100 per cent, we have to stick to­gether and fight harder, and that’s what the boys did tonight.”</p>
    <p>Academy grad­u­ate Wil­liams, who last sea­son was on loan at non­league side Kid­der­min­ster Har­ri­ers, could now be in line to make his Premier League de­but against David Moyes’ side.</p>
    <p>While Klopp be­lieves that the teenager can cope with the spotlight, he hit out at the pres­sure that is al­ready be­ing placed on his shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>“He did re­ally well,” said the Ger­man. “The only prob­lem is we have four days to the West Ham game and peo­ple will make a story of him, and he has to prove he can deal with that as well as every­thing was calm around him (un­til now).</p>
    <p>“He is a tal­ented boy, he plays for Eng­land U-20s, he is 19 years old and hasn’t played in the Premier League yet but has two Cham­pi­ons League ap­pear­ances and has won both games, which is pretty ex­cep­tional.”</p>
    <p>Apart from Wil­liams, Klopp said that he could also call on re­serve cen­tre-back Nathaniel Phillips, 23, who has made just one FA Cup ap­pear­ance for the Reds and untested French youth-team de­fender Billy Koume­tio, 17, although he ad­mit­ted that it was a bit like wad­ing into the deep end.</p>
    <p>“We have very young and in­ex­pe­ri­enced alternativ­es, and it looks like we will have to use one of them (against West Ham),” he added. “I don’t know yet.</p>
    <p>“But to be re­ally clear and pos­i­tive, Rhys wasn’t in one sit­u­a­tion a prob­lem for us, he had a re­ally good game.”</p>
    <p>WORST OUT­COME</p>
    <p>It’s ex­actly the last thing we needed. I know he felt a ham­string, and that’s not good. He said he could have played on but no sprints, which doesn’t help.</p>
