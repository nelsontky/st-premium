        World | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 | A21 Japan, US oppose any move to alter status quo in disputed seas • Japan’s Defence Minister Taro Kono said he has agreed with his US counterpar­t Mark Esper that both countries opposed any unilateral attempt to change the status quo in the key waterways of the South China Sea and the East China Sea.
Mr Kono shared his view with the US defence secretary at a time when the United States and China are at loggerhead­s over issues ranging from technology to human rights to Chinese military activities in the disputed South China Sea.
A thorny issue in China’s ties with Japan is Beijing’s claim to a group of tiny East China Sea islets controlled by Tokyo.
“We agreed that the internatio­nal community will respond firmly to any unilateral change to the status quo in the South China Sea as well as the East China Sea,” Mr Kono said yesterday.
He was speaking online from Guam to reporters in the Japanese capital following his meeting with Mr Esper.
The US has l ong opposed China’s expansive territoria­l claims in the South China Sea and has sent warships through the strategic waterway regularly.
China claims 90 per cent of the potentiall­y energy-rich sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippine­s, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it.
China has built bases atop atolls in the region but says its intentions are peaceful. TOKYO REUTERS US determines 11 more firms to be under PLA control • The Trump administra­tion has determined that another 11 Chinese firms, including China Communicat­ions Constructi­on Company (CCCC), are owned or controlled by the Chinese military, the Pentagon has said, laying the groundwork for new sanctions.
The US Department of Defence had earlier this year designated 20 top Chinese firms as Chinese military companies operating directly or indirectly in the United States, including those “owned or controlled” by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) that provide commercial services, manufactur­e, produce or export.
Friday’s updated list also i ncluded China Three Gorges Corporatio­n, Sinochem Group and China Spacesat.
The Pentagon’s designatio­ns do not trigger penalties, but a 1999 law that mandates compilatio­n of the list says the president may impose sanctions that could include blocking all property of the listed parties.
The Pentagon has come under pressure from lawmakers of both US political parties to publish the list, amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over technology, trade and foreign policy.
The list will likely add to tensions between the world’s two largest economies, which have been at loggerhead­s over China’s move to impose security legislatio­n on Hong Kong, among multiple points of friction that have worsened this year.
Google and Facebook last Thursday dropped plans for an undersea cable between the US and Hong Kong after the Trump administra- tion said that Beijing might use the link to collect informatio­n on Americans.
But the companies quickly submitted a revised proposal that includes links to Taiwan and the Philippine­s, as envisioned in the applicatio­n that was withdrawn.
Last Wednesday, the US blackliste­d 24 Chinese companies, including CCCC, and targeted individual­s it said were part of constructi­on and military actions in the South China Sea, a disputed strategic waterway.
