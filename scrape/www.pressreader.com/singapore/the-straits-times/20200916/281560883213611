    <p>Cab­bies, pri­vate-hire driv­ers and oper­a­tors have been thrown an ad­di­tional $112 mil­lion lifeline while the Covid-19 pan­demic bat­ters their in­dus­try and keeps rid­er­ship low. The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity said yes­ter­day that the ad­di­tional aid would help driv­ers and oper­a­tors at a time when many em­ploy­ees con­tinue to work from home and tourism ac­tiv­i­ties are muted.</p>
    <p>Cab­bies, pri­vate-hire driv­ers and oper­a­tors have been thrown an ad­di­tional $112 mil­lion lifeline while the Covid-19 pan­demic bat­ters their in­dus­try and keeps rid­er­ship low.</p>
    <p>The lat­est help fol­lows a $77 mil­lion pack­age an­nounced in Fe­bru­ary and a sec­ond tranche of $120 mil­lion rolled out in March, tak­ing the to­tal as­sis­tance given to the sec­tor to around $300 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said yes­ter­day that the ad­di­tional aid would help driv­ers and oper­a­tors at a time when many em­ploy­ees con­tinue to work from home and tourism ac­tiv­i­ties are muted.</p>
    <p>This has led to de­mand for taxis and pri­vate-hire ve­hi­cles drop­ping to 70 per cent of pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>LTA said point-to-point (P2P) ser­vices – which the in­dus­try of­fers – have also been hit by shorter trips and lower fares.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Amy Khor said: “This pack­age of re­lief mea­sures will fur­ther help to sup­port our driv­ers and oper­a­tors through this dif­fi­cult pe­riod and mit­i­gate some of their con­cerns and chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>Of the $112 mil­lion, $106 mil­lion will go to­wards a six-month ex­ten­sion of the Spe­cial Re­lief Fund (SRF) to March next year. The re­lief fund, which started in Fe­bru­ary, helps ac­tive taxi and pri­vate-hire driv­ers de­fray busi­ness costs by pro­vid­ing monthly pay­outs of $300 per ve­hi­cle per month (or $10 per day).</p>
    <p>More than 40,000 P2P driv­ers are ex­pected to qual­ify for the ex­tended re­lief fund, the LTA said.</p>
    <p>Taxi oper­a­tors have also pledged to con­tinue pro­vid­ing match­ing rental re­bates worth an ad­di­tional $29 mil­lion to their hir­ers.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Com­fort DelGro, the big­gest cab op­er­a­tor here, said it will ex­tend a 25 per cent rental waiver for all taxis from to­day to Oct 31. This in­cludes the $10 per taxi per day in the re­lief fund. The com­pany had waived rental dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and had ex­tended rental dis­counts since June.</p>
    <p>SMRT said that dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, it had pro­vided an av­er­age of $68 a day in rental re­bates. “Since Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally opened up its econ­omy... we have been sup­port­ing our taxi part­ners with an av­er­age of $30 a day in re­bates,” it said.</p>
    <p>LTA said P2P driv­ers will be al­lowed to do de­liv­er­ies for an­other year un­til end-Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Hin Kee, ad­viser to the Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion and Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion, said the groups had re­quested that aid be ex­tended and driv­ers be al­lowed to do de­liv­er­ies for longer.</p>
    <p>“Both groups of driv­ers are re­lieved that the SRF is con­tin­u­ing till March 2021,” Mr Ang noted.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Grab, the lead­ing ride-hail­ing firm here, said: “We are glad that our driver-part­ners can con­tinue to take on de­liv­ery jobs dur­ing these chal­leng­ing times.”</p>
    <p>Mr Neo Nam Heng, chair­man of di­ver­si­fied mo­tor group Prime, which is also a taxi and pri­vate-hire op­er­a­tor, said: “In­stead of giv­ing us fish, give us a fish­ing net. We need long-term so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>He added that the un­der­ly­ing prob­lem with the mar­ket is over­sup­ply, which ex­erts a huge de­pre­ci­a­tion cost on oper­a­tors and di­lutes in­come for driv­ers.</p>
    <p>There are around 16,000 taxis and 50,000 pri­vate-hire cars here.</p>
    <p>LTA said yes­ter­day that to align with re­quire­ments for taxi-driv­ers, all new ap­pli­cants for a Pri­vate Hire Car Driver’s Vo­ca­tional Li­cence must be Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens who are at least 30 years old.</p>
    <p>Mr Adrian Chew, 43, a long-time cabby who quit driv­ing re­cently, said the new mea­sures will not help much as long-term de­mand re­mains weak. “As long as tourists are not back and the num­ber of driv­ers re­mains high, $10 a day is not go­ing to do much,” he said.</p>
    <p>All new pri­vate-hire driv­ers will now have to be at least 30 years old and be Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens, in a move that could re­duce the in­dus­try’s current glut of driv­ers.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) yes­ter­day an­nounced the changes, which bring the re­quire­ments for pri­vate-hire car driv­ers in line with those of taxi driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, both Sin­ga­pore­ans and permanent res­i­dents (PRs) were el­i­gi­ble to ap­ply for a Pri­vate Hire Car Driver’s Vo­ca­tional Li­cence (PDVL), as long as they had held a driv­ing li­cence for two years. This meant driv­ers could be as young as 20.</p>
    <p>The changes will not af­fect ex­ist­ing pri­vate-hire driv­ers, and the LTA said all PDVL ap­pli­ca­tions re­ceived be­fore 5.30pm yes­ter­day will still be pro­cessed un­der the pre­vi­ous el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers de­scribed the changes as a vic­tory for in­dus­try play­ers who have been lob­by­ing for a level play­ing field be­tween cab­bies and pri­vate-hire driv­ers.</p>
    <p>“The over­sup­ply of taxis and pri­vate-hire cars pre­ceded Covid-19,” said Mr Ang Hin Kee, ex­ec­u­tive ad­viser to the Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion (NTA) and the Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion (NPHVA).</p>
    <p>“With pri­vate com­pa­nies of­fer­ing in­cen­tives, and bar­rier-to-en­try for firms like Uber and Grab low, the num­ber of driv­ers on the scene has ex­ploded over the years. We do not need more driv­ers. This de­vel­op­ment lev­els the play­ing field.”</p>
    <p>There are now about 40,000 ac­tive driv­ers, com­pris­ing 15,000 cab­bies and 25,000 pri­vate-hire driv­ers.</p>
    <p>With de­mand for rides cur­rently about 30 per cent lower than dur­ing pre-pan­demic lev­els, ob­servers said the stricter re­quire­ments could pro­tect ex­ist­ing and older driv­ers, given that pri­vate­hire com­pa­nies have more peo­ple ap­ply­ing dur­ing the eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences trans­port economist Wal­ter Th­e­seira said: “If younger driv­ers were com­ing onto the mar­ket dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods, where de­mand ex­ceeds sup­ply, they are not re­ally af­fect­ing full-time older driv­ers’ in­come. But now, de­mand has changed.”</p>
    <p>Both Grab and Go­jek said they will work closely with the au­thor­i­ties on the changes, but de­clined to give a de­tailed break­down of the de­mog­ra­phy of their fleets.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Amy Khor said there are now about 7,500 PDVL hold­ers be­low 30, which make up about 15 per cent of all PDVL hold­ers.</p>
    <p>In the first six months of this year, there were about 150 new PDVL hold­ers per month be­low the age of 30 – slightly less than 30 per cent of to­tal new PDVL hold­ers in the same pe­riod, she added.</p>
    <p>Dr Khor also noted that nearly 90 per cent of PDVL hold­ers un­der 30 drive part time.</p>
    <p>The NTA and NPHVA said the in­creased min­i­mum age will en­cour­age young driv­ers “to gain out­side work ex­pe­ri­ence which will en­large their skill sets and pro­vide them with long-term job prospects”.</p>
    <p>For 39-year-old Go­jek driver Lawrence Quek, the re­duced com­pe­ti­tion – with PRs and younger driv­ers – would be a wel­come re­prieve.</p>
    <p>He has been earn­ing less de­spite driv­ing more than 70 hours a week, a full 10 hours more each week than what he clocked last year.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to pro­tect the rice bowl of those who are 30 to 40 as we of­ten have fam­i­lies,” he said. “This also pro­tects Sin­ga­porean driv­ers, with many of the PRs only do­ing it part time.”</p>
    <p>Grab driver C.T. Chen, 57, said there is still fur­ther scope to pro­tect ex­ist­ing driv­ers.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mated that GrabHitch driv­ers – who are reg­u­lar driv­ers of­fer­ing car­pool­ing and do not have a PDVL or com­mer­cial in­sur­ance – have “taken away at least 20 per cent of our busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>“(GrabHitch) has been abused. There are full-time Hitch driv­ers now. If the Gov­ern­ment can do some­thing about this, we won’t need the $10,” he said, re­fer­ring to the $300 pay­out per ve­hi­cle per month un­der the Spe­cial Re­lief Fund, which works out to $10 a day.</p>
    <p>TIMELY MOVE</p>
    <p>The over­sup­ply of taxis and pri­vate-hire cars pre­ceded Covid-19. With pri­vate com­pa­nies of­fer­ing in­cen­tives, and bar­rier-to-en­try for firms like Uber and Grab low, the num­ber of driv­ers on the scene has ex­ploded over the years. We do not need more driv­ers. This de­vel­op­ment lev­els the play­ing field.</p>
    <p>MR ANG HIN KEE, ex­ec­u­tive ad­viser to the Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion and the Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
