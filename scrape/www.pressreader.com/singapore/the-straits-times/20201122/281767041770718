    <p>The sug­ges­tions by a di­verse group of 55 cit­i­zens, in­clud­ing em­ploy­ers, work­ers, house­wives and re­tirees, led to the new tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory re­leased last Tues­day on safe­guard­ing the men­tal well-be­ing of work­ers.</p>
    <p>A year ago, the Cit­i­zens’ Panel on Work-Life Har­mony sub­mit­ted 17 rec­om­men­da­tions, a key one of which was that peo­ple wanted more to be done for em­ploy­ees’ men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>The panel was part of the larger Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment, launched by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat and his fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship team in June last year, to in­volve cit­i­zens more widely in shaping poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing that some firms would not know how to go about sup­port­ing their work­ers’ men­tal well-be­ing, the par­ties in­volved – the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) – de­cided to give guid­ance on the mea­sures they can take.</p>
    <p>The Tri­par­tite Ad­vi­sory on Men­tal Well-be­ing at Work­places comes as em­ploy­ees face greater men­tal stress and a higher risk of burnout from jug­gling work and per­sonal com­mit­ments, es­pe­cially with telecom­mut­ing work ar­range­ments due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But putting to­gether the ad­vi­sory was not easy.</p>
    <p>The par­ties had to con­sult var­i­ous stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing per­sons with men­tal health con­di­tions, and agen­cies such as the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health and Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>They also de­bated a num­ber of is­sues, mostly in­volv­ing how rigid the guide­lines should be.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the rec­om­men­da­tion for em­ploy­ers to es­tab­lish a work-life har­mony pol­icy that of­fers clar­ity on af­ter-hours work com­mu­ni­ca­tion was “de­lib­er­ated quite ex­ten­sively”.</p>
    <p>The part­ners recog­nised the need for work­ers to have ad­e­quate rest, said MOM. “How­ever, there were con­cerns on the prac­ti­cal im­ple­men­ta­tion chal­lenges, such as whether it will cause more rigid­ity to both em­ployer and em­ployee, (and the) dif­fi­cul­ties in defin­ing ‘af­ter-work’ hours due to op­er­a­tional re­quire­ments and work across time zones.”</p>
    <p>It was then agreed that the rec­om­men­da­tion should not be too pre­scrip­tive, to give com­pa­nies and work­ers the lee­way to work out suit­able ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>In de­vel­op­ing the ad­vi­sory, ideas such as ex­tend­ing flex­i­ble ben­e­fits to cover men­tal well-be­ing con­sul­ta­tions and treat­ments were raised, said NTUC as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Melvin Yong.</p>
    <p>Other rec­om­men­da­tions in­clude train­ing man­agers to spot signs of dis­tress, and ap­point­ing men­tal well­ness cham­pi­ons to or­gan­ise rel­e­vant talks and work­shops.</p>
    <p>For a start, em­ploy­ers that do not have the re­sources to im­ple­ment a com­pre­hen­sive set of mea­sures could pri­ori­tise those that are more suit­able, said SNEF ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Sim Gim Guan.</p>
    <p>MOM said: “We hope that it will re­duce the in­stances of burnout or (med­i­cal leave) linked to men­tal health is­sues, and thereby im­prove em­ployee pro­duc­tiv­ity and ful­fil­ment at work.”</p>
