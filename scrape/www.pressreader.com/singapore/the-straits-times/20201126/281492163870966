    <p>Stock markets across the world are ral­ly­ing on signs that United States Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s transition to the White House is well un­der way, as well as promis­ing devel­op­ments on the coro­n­avirus vac­cine front.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing an overnight surge that saw the Dow Jones bench­mark crack 30,000 for the first time in his­tory, sev­eral Asian markets con­tin­ued to rise, while oth­ers paused to book profit.</p>
    <p>Signs that US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s transition to the White House is well un­der way and devel­op­ments that bode well for coro­n­avirus vac­cines are driv­ing a rally in stock markets across the world.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing an overnight surge that saw the Dow Jones bench­mark crack 30,000 for the first time in his­tory, sev­eral Asian markets con­tin­ued to rise, while oth­ers paused to book profit.</p>
    <p>The re­newed de­mand for shares pushed MSCI’s broad­est gauge of world stocks to a record high of 622.12.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nikkei Stock Av­er­age rose 0.5 per cent to a 29-year high, while Thai­land and Malaysia were up more than 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong also rose 0.3 per cent, though the Straits Times In­dex (STI) took a breather, giv­ing up 0.76 per cent af­ter hav­ing gained 17.5 per cent since the start of this month.</p>
    <p>“The fear of miss­ing out is am­pli­fy­ing the rally in the stock markets. Buy first, ask later,” CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that the STI had lost 20 per cent from Jan­uary un­til this month, when it started ris­ing. Un­til that point, it had been the sec­ond worst per­former in Asia this year, af­ter Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“(Yes­ter­day’s) bout of profit tak­ing is a healthy breather. In­vestors are just tak­ing money off the ta­ble af­ter a very good rally,” he added.</p>
    <p>The rally for global stocks is set to con­tinue for at least six months, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters poll fore­cast yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The world is go­ing to look a lot bet­ter this time next year than it does now, and that’s what eq­uity markets are re­flect­ing,” JP Mor­gan As­set Man­age­ment global mar­ket strate­gist Mike Bell told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Global en­ergy shares have risen al­most 34 per cent so far this month, on track for their best month on record as crude prices rally. Oil prices held near their high­est lev­els since March on the im­proved global eco­nomic outlook. Brent fu­tures were up 1.2 per cent to US$48.42 per bar­rel, touch­ing a high last seen in March.</p>
    <p>In the Sin­ga­pore stock mar­ket, in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors have been net buy­ers of nearly $1.17 bil­lion worth of shares in the past three weeks, com­pared with dur­ing the first 10 months of this year when they were net sell­ers of nearly $7.1 bil­lion worth of shares.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore stocks’ val­u­a­tions have also be­come more “com­pelling” amid a slew of pos­i­tive news, said Mor­gan Stan­ley.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Song: “This year is the pan­demic year, but next year is the vac­cine year. If there is less fric­tion on the global trade stage with a less con­fronta­tional US gov­ern­ment, we could be look­ing at a faster global re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Markets are also cheered by Mr Bi­den’s nom­i­na­tion of for­mer Fed chair­man Janet Yellen as his Trea­sury sec­re­tary, and she may work with cur­rent chair­man Jerome Pow­ell in un­leash­ing US fis­cal and mon­e­tary stim­u­lus to fos­ter a swifter re­cov­ery, Dai­lyFX.com strate­gist Mar­garet Yang said.</p>
    <p>“Markets ap­peared to have looked past cur­rent head­winds into fu­ture re­cov­ery sto­ries... in favour of cycli­cal in­dus­tries – en­ergy, ma­te­ri­als, fi­nan­cials, air­lines and in­dus­tri­als. Stock prices of these tra­di­tional in­dus­tries are still far from reach­ing their pre-Covid lev­els, sug­gest­ing that the vac­cine-rally may have fur­ther room to go,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Song said: “The markets have shrugged off the spike in Covid-19 cases world­wide and are bank­ing on hopes of vac­cine suc­cess. Don’t stand in front of that train.”</p>
