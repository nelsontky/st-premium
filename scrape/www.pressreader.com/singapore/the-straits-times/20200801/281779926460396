    <p>• There is no “zero risk” strat­egy for coun­tries eas­ing in­ter­na­tional travel re­stric­tions dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, and es­sen­tial travel for emer­gen­cies should re­main the pri­or­ity, said the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>In a long-awaited up­date to its guid­ance on travel, the United Na­tions global health agency said cross-bor­der trips for emer­gen­cies, hu­man­i­tar­ian work, the trans­fer of es­sen­tial per­son­nel and repa­tri­a­tion would con­sti­tute es­sen­tial travel.</p>
    <p>“There is no ‘zero risk’ when con­sid­er­ing the po­ten­tial im­por­ta­tion or ex­por­ta­tion of cases in the con­text of in­ter­na­tional travel,” it said in the up­dated guid­ance posted on its web­site on Thurs­day. A surge of new in­fec­tions in many parts of the world has prompted some coun­tries to rein­tro­duce some travel re­stric­tions. The WHO had said in June it would up­date its travel guide­lines be­fore the north­ern hemi­sphere sum­mer hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s guid­ance can be used by gov­ern­ments and in­dus­tries to help shape poli­cies, but is not en­force­able. The up­dated travel ad­vice is lit­tle changed from pre­vi­ous guid­ance, which also in­cluded in­fec­tion con­trol ad­vice ap­pli­ca­ble in other set­tings such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing, wear­ing masks, wash­ing hands and avoid­ing touch­ing the face.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s emer­gency com­mit­tee was set to meet for a fourth time yes­ter­day to as­sess the rag­ing pan­demic. The group­ing, com­pris­ing around 20 mem­bers and ad­vis­ers, can pro­pose new rec­om­men­da­tions or amend ex­ist­ing ones.</p>
