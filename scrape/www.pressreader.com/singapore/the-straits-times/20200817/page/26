6319-5488 stnewsdesk@sph.com.sg Business: Photo: Home: Sport: Art: On trial: A new way to deliver food What’s in that box? Let’s find out. It looks like one of us... but FRIED! Restrict visas to stem imported Covid-19 cases The recent daily updates of Covid-19 infection cases in Singapore show an uptick in imported cases.
While I laud our authoritie­s for taking all necessary precaution­s to welcome travellers, work pass holders and their dependants to our shores, we have also to bear in mind that the risk is always there that this could lead to more community cases.
Countries like South Korea have implemente­d entry restrictio­ns against some countries where Covid-19 cases are surging, through temporary restrictio­ns on flights and the issuance of visas.
China took a strict approach of reward and punishment of global airlines by suspending flights if a certain number of passengers who were found to have the coronaviru­s were on those flights.
Does Singapore have such systems? If not, incoming people should produce proof of having tested negative for Covid-19 before being allowed to set foot in Singapore.
They should also be tested before heading to their dedicated facilities to serve their stay-home notice.
This is a more robust approach that complement­s efforts within the community to stem the spread of the virus here. Drone takes fried chicken wings to offshore vessel Set up one-stop centre to help people with estate planning buy-in for such tools is the need to have profession­als such as a lawyer or doctor to validate, undersign and witness a person’s applicatio­n, and this can be costly.
The proposed one-stop service centre should be able to address this as the centre could set up a tender system to ensure such profession­al fees are set at a very competitiv­e price to help citizens. Rodney Neo Eng Chong Legal tools such as the Advance Medical Directive, Lasting Power of Attorney and wills are very useful.
But to really increase the take-up rate among citizens, especially seniors and the less able, the Government should go further by setting up a one-stop service centre that will allow people to set all these up at one go.
A major obstacle to greater Banks well-positioned to manage their own dividend payouts should follow suit. They probably have to, given instances of failed financial institutio­ns in some of these jurisdicti­ons.
There have been more cases of corporates with questionab­le management practices and weak financial positions and yet the dividend restrictio­ns are aimed only at banks – which seems like a skewed approach.
In any case, MAS’ action will inevitably send a signal, even though unintended, for other corporates to reduce their dividend payouts.
Ultimately, the losers are the retail investors. Lai Kin Guan I am not convinced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) response (MAS move balances banks’ financial positions with shareholde­rs’ cash-flow needs, Aug 14) to Mr Rajagopala­n Krishnamoo­rthy’s letter (MAS request of banks not fair to retail investors, Aug 10).
Banks and finance companies here are generally more prudent and better managed than most other corporates. Given this, they have earned the public’s confidence in their ability to manage their dividend payouts in relation to their profitabil­ity and reserves needs.
We have seen many failed corporates in Singapore, but rarely failed Singapore banks.
Just because major jurisdicti­ons, like the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and Australia, have taken pre-emptive capital conservati­on measures similar to MAS’ dividend restrictio­n, it does not mean we Courts’ emphasis on rehab for offenders troubles some I found Mr Benny Tan’s Opinion contributi­on enlighteni­ng (Understand­ing what judges consider in sentencing, Aug 15).
It gives a person, unfamiliar with the technicali­ties of law, an insight into the court’s sentencing process.
I find it encouragin­g that members of the public are becoming more interested in and concerned about the sentencing system.
Few would dispute that no two cases are exactly alike and mitigating factors differ from one case to another.
Still, there must be a minimum threshold that the court must uphold to protect the sanctity of laws and social values which the general community holds dear.
Recent cases of judgment in which the court appears to emphasise the rehabilita­tive prospects of an offender rather than show empathy towards a victim’s suffering have been a divisive issue that has troubled many.
In these instances, perhaps it would be good to make written judgments compulsory so that reference could be made for future similar crimes, regardless of whether an appeal has been filed.
Laws are to be used to protect the weak and vulnerable, and sentencing should reflect the acceptable social norms accordingl­y.
Singaporea­ns, especially the victims of a violent crime, should not feel that the legal and justice system has let them down. Lawrence Loh Kiah Muan Rental relief unfair to landlords Foo Sing Kheng As an individual landlord, I just received a notice from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) detailing the amount of rental relief I am required to pass on to my tenant.
For an individual landlord to apply to an assessor to reduce the amount of relief payable, I have to meet a few conditions.
One is that rental income for year of assessment 2019 must be at least 75 per cent of total income. What is the reason for using YA2019? The economy started to nosedive only at the start of 2020.
Based on this criterion, I am not eligible to apply for reduction of rental relief payable to the tenant.
Another criterion is that the annual value of the commercial property must be less than $60,000. Most Housing Board shops have annual value more than this.
The Government was supposed to provide relief of up to two months for qualifying tenants. The property tax rebate and cash grant do not add up to that and now landlords are required to top up the difference. Why punish the landlords unfairly?
Also, it was stated in the notice from Iras that tenants who are eligible for cash grants are most likely to also qualify for the additional rental relief.
How did Iras come to such a conclusion? How would Iras be sure that these tenants’ turnover for April and May 2020 will be at least 35 per cent less than in 2019? Because of this presumptio­n, tenants will be emboldened to demand the additional relief from the landlord.
I understand the pandemic has disrupted businesses and lives, and everyone has to make adjustment­s. I ask the Government not to place an unfair burden on landlords. Many of us are also trying to keep our heads above water.
The economy last year was good – I had self-employed income then. But this year, because of Covid-19, my self-employed income is zero.
In all, I will probably have to forgo at least three months of rental – who is going to pay my bills during this period then? Some “what if” questions about US-China ties It is interestin­g to ask a few “what if” questions about the rivalry between the US and China.
What if China were not ruled by a so-called “authoritat­ive communist party” but by a “democratic­ally chosen party”? Would the United States welcome an advanced and competitiv­e China with open arms?
If China were ruled by the Chinese Communist Party but still a backward Third World country, would the US consider it a greater threat than Russia? Wouldn’t it hold China in total contempt?
When China developed nuclear weapons, it was a very expensive undertakin­g for a then very poor country. Many were opposed to it, including famed novelist Louis Cha, or Jin Yong, who exclaimed: “We want to have trousers rather than nuclear weapons.”
To all these, chairman Mao Zedong replied: “Even a beggar must have a stick to beat dogs.”
I still remember the commentary in Time magazine when it published the news of China launching its first nuclear bomb: “Open the Chinese hands and you will find them empty.”
China’s hands are not empty today and the Chinese sticks can do more than beat dogs.
If China did not develop nuclear weapons, isn’t it `possible that the US military would have been sent into Beijing long ago? See what North Korea and Iran have had to go through when they try to do the same.
If China did not have nuclear weapons, would Russia find it worth its while to establish such friendly relations with Beijing? Wouldn’t it agree with the US to sanction China for developing nuclear weapons?
There is no winner when two nuclear powers go to war. The only beneficiar­y if the US and China were to destroy each other would be Russia.
The only way for China to appease the US and its allies is for it to voluntaril­y be less assertive, more submissive, more backward and less competitiv­e. That reminds me of a Chinese saying, “Asking a tiger for its skin”.
Will 1.3 billion Chinese tigers willingly give up their skins?
