    <p>Sev­eral nightlife busi­nesses have wel­comed the Gov­ern­ment’s lat­est ini­tia­tives an­nounced on Fri­day, such as al­low­ing some op­er­a­tors to re­sume busi­ness by next month or Jan­uary with strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>For a start, there is a limit of 25 busi­nesses that can par­tic­i­pate in this two- to three-month pi­lot.</p>
    <p>The aid comes as many busi­nesses have been closed for nine months and count­ing due to Covid-19 con­cerns.</p>
    <p>But other op­er­a­tors are wor­ried that some of the new mea­sures do not make sense for them be­cause of the costs in­volved.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (SNBA) pres­i­dent Joseph Ong said the in­dus­try has been look­ing out for the mea­sures, and the as­so­ci­a­tion has re­ceived more than 50 queries on the new moves to help op­er­a­tors switch to an­other busi­ness after Fri­day’s an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>“There are also a lot of in­quiries on the pi­lot pro­gramme, but the num­ber of busi­nesses that can en­ter it would be small,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures they will need to im­ple­ment in­clude en­sur­ing that cus­tomers wear masks on the dance floor and pro­vide proof of neg­a­tive Covid-19 tests be­fore en­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Nightlife joints not in the pi­lot can get fi­nan­cial sup­port to let them ei­ther pivot to other busi­ness l i n e s , wi t h a g r a n t o f u p t o $50,000, or exit with a one-off pay­ment of $30,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said SNBA will help nightlife busi­nesses with piv­ot­ing or ex­it­ing. “We will be fa­cil­i­tat­ing the whole process – whether they are mem­bers or not – and pro­vide them with the nec­es­sary link-ups to see what are the best op­tions for them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Francesca Way, co-founder of A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive, which runs retro bars and clubs Nine­teen80 and Pin­ball Wizard, said the pi­lot “is a per­fect way to see how we can work in terms of re­open­ing in a post-Covid-19 world”.</p>
    <p>She does not think the sug­gested mea­sures, such as tests and masks on the dance floor, are pro­hib­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, safety is a pri­or­ity. The fact is that nightlife as it was be­fore needs to change. Covid-19 has changed the way we so­cialise, and night­clubs have to adapt to that too,” she added.</p>
    <p>Zouk Group chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Li said “any­thing we can do to push ahead in terms of open­ing up this in­dus­try again in a safe man­ner is def­i­nitely wel­come”.</p>
    <p>“Zouk Group will do what­ever which is within our power to pave a way for nightlife and en­ter­tain­ment to come back, as it is sorely missed in Sin­ga­pore,” he added.</p>
    <p>Flex­i­bil­ity in the new mea­sures</p>
    <p>HELP­ING HAND</p>
    <p>We will be fa­cil­i­tat­ing the whole process – whether they are mem­bers or not – and pro­vide them with the nec­es­sary link-ups to see what are the best op­tions for them.</p>
    <p>MR JOSEPH ONG, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion, who says it will help nightlife busi­nesses with piv­ot­ing to other busi­ness lines or ex­it­ing.</p>
    <p>was re­quested by some op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if a busi­ness gets fi­nan­cial aid un­der the nightlife mea­sures, it can­not re­sume nightlife op­er­a­tions for at least 12 months.</p>
    <p>But “busi­nesses should be al­lowed to choose to re­vert to their core busi­ness, if things re­main un­der con­trol and life goes into what­ever the new nor­mal is at the time”, said Bol­ly­wood club Magic</p>
    <p>Car­pet founder Sanjay Rekhi.</p>
    <p>Some nightlife busi­nesses are also wor­ried that the new mea­sures will not work after tak­ing costs into ac­count.</p>
    <p>Mr Si­mon Sim, a com­mit­tee mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore En­ter­tain­ment Af­fil­i­a­tion, said the gen­eral sen­ti­ment among karaoke joints is that the pi­lot pro­gramme is “not work­able”.</p>
    <p>The manda­tory Covid-19 test is the main ob­sta­cle, as the test’s cost might out­weigh the price of a karaoke ses­sion it­self. Un­like cruise ship pas­sen­gers, who might be will­ing to shell out ex­tra money to pay for the test to board cruise ships, karaoke cus­tomers would feel the pinch more as the ses­sions are rel­a­tively cheaper, he said.</p>
    <p>“The pi­lot is a baby step to re­open­ing, and it’s bet­ter than not open­ing at all. But it’s not very vi­able,” said Mr Sim, who owns Karaoke Times.</p>
    <p>The grants given, while wel­come, are also far from suf­fi­cient for busi­nesses to exit the in­dus­try, as they might not even cover the cost of a month’s rental owed to land­lords, he added.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it helps that much, but it is bet­ter than noth­ing.”</p>
