        TOPOF THE NEWS A7 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 2020 | | | It is a roller coaster. It is not like a hurricane that is coming through and we know what to do. We know we got to clean up and rebuild, and everybody is accustomed to the timeframe. But with this, there are just so many unknowns. Key Indian minister Amit Shah hospitalis­ed after testing positive • India’s Interior Minister Amit Shah said yesterday he has been admitted to hospital after getting infected by the coronaviru­s. This makes him the most senior politician in the country to test positive for the disease.
Mr Shah, a close aide to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, heads a ministry that has been at the forefront of managing the pandemic.
India’s coronaviru­s outbreak is the third-worst in the world behind the United states and Brazil, with nearly 1.7 million confirmed cases and 36,500 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
“I request all of you who came in contact with me in the last few days to isolate yourselves and get tested,” Mr Shah said in a tweet.
The 55-year-old minister said he got himself tested after exhibiting initial symptoms of Covid-19. “My health is fine, but I am being hospitalis­ed on the advice of doctors.”
An Interior Ministry spokesman said he was unable to immediatel­y comment on when Mr Shah had last met Mr Modi.
Meanwhile, Indian movie star Amitabh Bachchan, who was hospitalis­ed on July 11, was discharged after his latest coronaviru­s test came back negative, his son Abhishek Bachchan tweeted.
