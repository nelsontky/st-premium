    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You are open to a new per­son or no­tion. You will look back on this day as a turn­ing point, so roll with what­ever comes your way.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Use your charm to show your friends or cus­tomers what you re­ally think of them. It is eas­ier than ever to get folks to see things your way.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Do not worry too much if your mood does not match the cir­cum­stances, as you need to feel this way to get ready for more in­ten­sity to come.</p>
    <p>Can­cer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You can­not man­age your en­ergy flow. It could be a bad thing if you have lots on your plate. If it is an easy day, just let things flow.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your amaz­ing en­ergy is driv­ing you to get out there. Travel would be per­fect, but you can sat­isfy this hunger in all sorts of other ways too.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You do not want to stick with your prin­ci­ples – yet that is what you are do­ing to­day. Think of it as a way to show peo­ple what you have to of­fer.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Use to­day’s great en­ergy to re­bal­ance your var­i­ous peo­ple and projects. You have to tackle it all with a bit more thought­ful­ness.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your per­sonal is­sues are in­flu­enced by your deep­est spir­i­tual think­ing, so do not be sur­prised to be shak­ing things up in fairly ma­jor ways.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Share your good­will with oth­ers. Your amaz­ing en­ergy is at­trac­tive and you ought to be able to show them how to live life bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19) Things do not seem pos­si­ble, but you can still make a break­through. It is a good time to push your­self and your peo­ple to new heights.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You need to let oth­ers know what is go­ing on. Your or­gan­i­sa­tional tal­ents come in handy at work, or maybe with your friends.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Try to do what­ever it takes to right the sit­u­a­tion, even if it is dif­fi­cult and you may not be re­spon­si­ble for what went wrong. Make it right.</p>
