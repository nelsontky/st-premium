    <p>NEW YORK • Live-streamed con­certs are now a com­mon fea­ture of the coro­n­avirus age, with mu­si­cians vy­ing for a spot on the over­crowded vir­tual stage even when they are do­ing it for free.</p>
    <p>Last week­end, Haitian disc jockey Michael Brun hoped to find a way to make streams more prof­itable, test­ing a model rarely used in mu­sic. The prac­tice is known as “ge­ofenc­ing” – lim­it­ing vir­tual view­ers to a spe­cific ge­o­graphic area.</p>
    <p>His strat­egy aimed to draw an au­di­ence for a fee by cater­ing to cer­tain cities.</p>
    <p>Like many artists, the New York­based Brun – who has played at top fes­ti­vals and seen his remixes gen­er­ate mil­lions of streams – has de­liv­ered sev­eral free vir­tual shows from his apart­ment since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>His first three paid con­certs since then was ge­ofenced to peo­ple within 160km of Los An­ge­les, Mi­ami and Chicago, re­spec­tively, at US$5 (S$6.80) a ticket.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old spun from Man­hat­tan’s Le Pois­son Rouge venue, with higher-qual­ity pro­duc­tion than the of­ten-min­i­mal­ist streams that have be­come the norm.</p>
    <p>Brun said he hoped mak­ing his shows lo­ca­tion-spe­cific height­ened the ex­pe­ri­ence for fans, with each show lim­ited to 500 view­ers.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just a ran­dom live on a ran­dom day,” he said. “This feels like more of a mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Brun said he was happy to do free shows from home – es­pe­cially in the early days of the pan­demic plagued by job loss, fear and un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>And though he made no money off of that work, he said for many artists, the makeshift streamed shows were a “ne­ces­sity” to sus­tain their au­di­ences. “No­body re­ally knows when live mu­sic is go­ing to come back, so you don’t want to just dis­ap­pear,” Brun said.</p>
    <p>Most artists make the vast ma­jor­ity of their in­come from tour­ing, so the hia­tus of i n-per­son shows sent shock­waves through the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Brun hoped ex­per­i­ment­ing with ways to make dig­i­tal streams more fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able could al­le­vi­ate the pres­sure.</p>
    <p>His set de­sign and setlists were spe­cific to each show, which was aired live via Zoom. View­ers bought ac­cess via tick­et­ing com­pany Tixr.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the en­try fees to his dig­i­tal shows, Brun was spon­sored by rum brand Bac­ardi, a type of part­ner­ship the elec­tronic mu­sic pro­ducer said would likely be key to sup­port­ing mu­si­cians go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>“The brands that are as­so­ci­ated with the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try ben­e­fit from artists,” he said. “For them to be able to con­tinue hav­ing some­one to mar­ket to, you have to sus­tain the peo­ple creat­ing the cul­ture” that brands tar­get.</p>
    <p>Mr Thomas Fiss, vice-pres­i­dent of Mar­ket­ing at Awal – Brun’s la­bel and a pro­duc­ing part­ner on the show – said the last sev­eral months have been “trial by fire” as the in­dus­try crossed its fin­gers the pan­demic would be short-lived.</p>
    <p>But it is now clear live per­for­mance will not be “back to nor­mal” for quite some time and Mr Fiss said the in­dus­try must re­build cre­atively in the mean­time.</p>
    <p>“Fans are crav­ing con­nec­tion again,” he said, adding that “we’ve seen a slight dip in the wider live streams”.</p>
    <p>While ge­ofenc­ing is “by no means a per­fect so­lu­tion”, he said “it’s a gen­uine step for­ward”, which could hope­fully “help other artists cre­ate their own model in the same re­gard”.</p>
    <p>Brun thought the model could prove use­ful even in a post-pan­demic world, es­pe­cially for reach­ing au­di­ences out­side the usual tour des­ti­na­tions – his na­tive Haiti, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>And though dig­i­tal shows can­not re­place in-per­son con­certs, the pro­ducer said he en­joys el­e­ments of streamed per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>“You’re in­ter­act­ing with peo­ple on a scale that you would never be able to in­ter­act with them at a real show,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple send­ing mes­sages can feel in­ti­mate. It feels like you’re in a com­mu­nity.”</p>
