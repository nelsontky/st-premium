    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will nom­i­nate former Pen­tagon of­fi­cial Kath­leen Hicks to serve as the first fe­male deputy de­fence sec­re­tary, say­ing he wanted some­one who knows the depart­ment “in­side and out” to help re­store or­der to an agency he says was cast into dis­ar­ray by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Dr Colin Kahl, who served as his na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser when he was vice-pres­i­dent, will be nom­i­nated for un­der­sec­re­tary of de­fence for pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tions to Mr Bi­den’s na­tional se­cu­rity team, an­nounced on Wed­nes­day, sig­nal a re­turn to ex­pe­ri­enced hands af­ter Mr Trump has run through a num­ber of de­fence lead­ers, in­clud­ing two con­firmed sec­re­taries and three act­ing sec­re­taries of de­fence. Mr Bi­den com­plained on Mon­day that key se­cu­rity posts have been “hol­lowed out” in per­son­nel, ca­pac­ity and morale.</p>
    <p>Ms Hicks and Dr Kahl would re­port to Mr Lloyd Austin, the re­tired four-star Army gen­eral and Raytheon Tech­nolo­gies Corp board member who Mr Bi­den has tapped to be sec­re­tary of de­fence.</p>
    <p>Mr Austin’s nom­i­na­tion faces an ad­di­tional hur­dle in that both cham­bers of Congress would have to ap­prove a waiver to a law pro­hibit­ing re­cently re­tired mil­i­tary of­fi­cers to fill the top civil­ian job at the depart­ment. Nei­ther Ms Hicks nor Dr Kahl have served in the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Ms Hicks, who heads Mr Bi­den’s Pen­tagon tran­si­tion team, is a think-tank ex­pert on na­tional se­cu­rity at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies and is on the board of Aero­space Cor­po­ra­tion. She served as deputy un­der­sec­re­tary of de­fence for strat­egy, plans and forces from 2009-2012 and as prin­ci­pal deputy un­der­sec­re­tary of de­fence for pol­icy from 2012-2013.</p>
    <p>She would have the No. 2 job at the Pen­tagon, which di­rects dayto-day man­age­ment of the largest fed­eral bu­reau­cracy. Mr Bi­den has also said he wants the depart­ment to take on big­ger roles in vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion and cli­mate pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Ms Kori Schake, di­rec­tor of na­tional se­cu­rity pro­grammes for the con­ser­va­tive Amer­i­can En­ter­prise In­sti­tute, praised Ms Hicks as “se­ri­ous-minded and ex­pe­ri­enced.” She cited the role Ms Hicks played in de­vel­op­ing two ma­jor de­fence pol­icy blue­prints in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion and on a con­gres­sion­ally man­dated ad­vi­sory panel that an­a­lysed the 2018 Na­tional De­fence Strat­egy, which has driven de­fence depart­ment spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Kahl, a pro­fes­sor at Stan­ford Univer­sity, has served in Pen­tagon roles, most re­cently as deputy as­sis­tant sec­re­tary of de­fence for the Mid­dle East at the be­gin­ning of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
