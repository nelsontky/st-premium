    <p>NEW YORK Billy McFar­land, the dis­graced en­tre­pre­neur be­hind the no­to­ri­ous Fyre Fes­ti­val and a cur­rent fed­eral i nmate, has been placed in soli­tary con­fine­ment af­ter he par­tic­i­pated in a newly re­leased pod­cast about his crimes.</p>
    <p>McFar­land, 28, who is serv­ing six years for fraud in an Ohio prison, can be heard dis­cussing his var­i­ous high jinks and their af­ter­math in de­tail from a prison phone on a show ti­tled Dump­ster Fyre, which pre­miered last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>McFar­land’s lawyer said he has been in 23-hours-a-day soli­tary con­fine­ment since last week, af­ter a trailer for the pod­cast was re­leased on­line.</p>
    <p>He may re­main there for up to 90 days or more, pend­ing an un­spec­i­fied in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the Fed­eral Bureau of Pris­ons.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve the in­ves­ti­ga­tion stems from his par­tic­i­pa­tion in the pod­cast and the photograph­s that were taken and used in the trailer, which were all prop­erly taken,” said the lawyer, Mr Ja­son Russo.</p>
    <p>“We don’t be­lieve he’s vi­o­lated any rule or reg­u­la­tion and there can’t pos­si­bly be any­thing else. He’s been a model pris­oner there.”</p>
    <p>McFar­land is be­ing held at FCI Elk­ton i n Lis­bon, Ohio, where Mr Russo said in­mates are per­mit­ted to use the phones, and that all calls are recorded and screened by the prison.</p>
    <p>As for the pho­tos of McFar­land in­side, which have been posted on an In­sta­gram ac­count that bills it­self as be­ing “man­aged by Billy’s team”, Mr Russo said in­mates are per­mit­ted to use dis­pos­able cam­eras to take pho­tos, and that those, too, are screened be­fore they can be kept or mailed out.</p>
    <p>Pod­cast­ing from within prison is not un­heard of. Ear Hus­tle, pro­duced at San Quentin State Prison, was cre­ated in 2017 by an in­mate at the time, along with the help of an out­side vol­un­teer, while Un­cuffed tells the stories of peo­ple in­car­cer­ated in Cal­i­for­nia from the in­side.</p>
    <p>On the first episode of Dump­ster Fyre, in which he is in­ter­viewed by pod­caster Jor­dan Har­bin­ger, McFar­land says in­spi­ra­tion for the pod­cast came last year, dur­ing his pre­vi­ous three-month stint in soli­tary con­fine­ment, which he called a “much-needed con­fronta­tion with re­al­ity” and the “hard­est but most im­pact­ful pe­riod of my life”.</p>
    <p>“Soli­tary led to this forced re­flec­tion on my mis­takes and the peo­ple I hurt,” he said, not­ing that any pro­ceeds he earns from Dump­ster Fyre would go to­wards the US$26 mil­lion (S$35.3 mil­lion) in resti­tu­tion he owes his vic­tims.</p>
    <p>“The first thing I need to do is take re­spon­si­bil­ity for all of my ac­tions,” he said, promis­ing to fol­low “all the rules” and give “com­plete trans­parency”.</p>
    <p>The Fyre Fes­ti­val, which was the sub­ject of du­elling doc­u­men­taries last year, was sup­posed to be a lux­ury mu­sic fes­ti­val with glam­orous ac­com­mo­da­tion and top-tier tal­ent, but never hap­pened af­ter guests ar­rived to find a sham­bolic set-up on the is­land of Great Ex­uma in the Ba­hamas in April 2017.</p>
    <p>While out on bail af­ter ini­tially plead­ing guilty to two counts of wire fraud, McFar­land was charged with two more counts of fraud re­lated to a new com­pany that pros­e­cu­tors said sold fake tick­ets to fash­ion, mu­sic and sports events and was said to have cost at least 30 vic­tims a min­i­mum of about US$150,000.</p>
    <p>On the pod­cast, McFar­land said: “I was des­per­ate and thought I could dig my­self out of the hole.”</p>
    <p>He is sched­uled to be re­leased on Aug 30, 2023, his lawyer said.</p>
