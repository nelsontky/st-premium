    <p>Job of­fers with­drawn. Life plans dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>The ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic on young peo­ple are rip­pling across Asia, home to more youth than any other re­gion glob­ally. With the prospects of a ‘lost gen­er­a­tion’ ris­ing, will they find new paths to ful­fil their as­pi­ra­tions, or be left be­hind?</p>
    <p>Tai­lor Vikas Kumar, 25, from In­dia’s eastern state of Bi­har, had am­bi­tious plans for the next two years. Af­ter chalk­ing up seven years’ ex­pe­ri­ence at a tex­tile firm in Mum­bai, earn­ing about 25,000 ru­pees (S$450) a month, he had planned to strike out on his own and start a small tai­lor­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He had also wanted to up­grade his mud-and-straw hut in Bi­har, which houses his par­ents, wife and two chil­dren, into a brick build­ing.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic way­laid his plans. The lock­down im­posed by the In­dian gov­ern­ment in March pre­vented him from go­ing to work, forc­ing him to re­turn home in May.</p>
    <p>His sav­ings of 100,000 ru­pees have all been used up in en­sur­ing that his fam­ily sur­vives this dif­fi­cult phase, leav­ing no spare cash for re­build­ing their home.</p>
    <p>Work has not re­sumed fully enough at the tex­tile firm to con­vince Mr Kumar, who was paid by the day, to re­turn to Mum­bai. Nei­ther are there op­por­tu­ni­ties for him in his vil­lage – his fam­ily does not own farm­ing land.</p>
    <p>“This year has been wasted,” laments Mr Kumar, who has put his plans on hold till 2022.</p>
    <p>His story of how the pan­demic dis­rupted his life plans and un­der­mined his fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity has been ex­pe­ri­enced by young adults across Asia.</p>
    <p>With most economies in the re­gion still reel­ing from the fall­out of the pan­demic, fears are mount­ing over the prospect of a “lost gen­er­a­tion” in Asia, which is home to more youth than any other re­gion.</p>
    <p>This lost gen­er­a­tion may be scarred eco­nom­i­cally, so­cially and psy­cho­log­i­cally by the far-reach­ing ef­fects of the cri­sis, ow­ing to the un­prece­dented ex­tent of its im­pact, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have not only dealt a blow to busi­nesses but also taken a toll on in­di­vid­u­als’ men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate among youth has seen a big­ger in­crease than that for adults, pre­lim­i­nary data from the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion (ILO) in­di­cates. For un­em­ploy­ment data, the ILO de­fines youth as those aged 15 to 24.</p>
    <p>Young work­ers must also con­tend with “wage scar­ring ef­fects”, with re­search in­di­cat­ing that those who find employment af­ter re­ces­sions may have to deal with a last­ing neg­a­tive im­pact on their pro­duc­tiv­ity and wages, said the ILO.</p>
    <p>This may af­fect the life tra­jec­to­ries of the younger gen­er­a­tion, warns Pro­fes­sor Jean Ye­ung, found­ing di­rec­tor of the Centre for Fam­ily and Pop­u­la­tion Re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With­out a smooth tran­si­tion into the job mar­ket, it can be hard for young adults to em­bark on other sig­nif­i­cant adult­hood events, such as mar­riage, par­ent­hood, or set­ting up their own house­holds, she says.</p>
    <p>“The longer the cur­rent cri­sis lasts, the harder it is for the youth to re­cover from its neg­a­tive im­pact. With no ef­fec­tive in­ter­ven­tions, they could very well be­come a lost gen­er­a­tion,” says Prof Ye­ung.</p>
    <p>Such fears are pal­pa­ble in Ja­pan, where an ex­pert panel at the coun­try’s Labour Min­istry has urged ef­forts to sup­port new grad­u­ates to avoid an­other “employment ice age”. This refers to the pe­riod af­ter the burst­ing of the as­set-price bub­ble of the 1980s, when fresh grad­u­ates could not find jobs and were stuck in a vi­cious cir­cle of ir­reg­u­lar dead-end con­tract employment.</p>
    <p>Due to Covid-19, the num­ber of peo­ple in Ja­pan who grad­u­ate from univer­sity or high school with­out find­ing a job is ex­pected to in­crease rapidly next year, from 20,000 this year, though no es­ti­mates for next year are avail­able yet.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an Au­gust re­port by the ILO, the youth un­em­ploy­ment rate in Hong Kong, Ja­pan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thai­land and Viet­nam in­creased from the fourth quar­ter of last year to the first quar­ter of this year. This was a more sig­nif­i­cant in­crease than that of the un­em­ploy­ment rate for adults aged 25 and above in th­ese coun­tries.</p>
    <p>And more than 100 mil­lion young work­ers in Asia and the Pa­cific – nearly one in two young work­ers in the re­gion – are em­ployed in sec­tors whose eco­nomic out­put has been hit ow­ing to Covid-19, based on pre­lim­i­nary es­ti­mates for this year, says the ILO. Th­ese sec­tors in­clude ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices, and whole­sale and re­tail trade.</p>
    <p>While youth in Asia are wor­ried about their job prospects, many fresh grad­u­ates and young work­ers are tem­per­ing their ex­pec­ta­tions or set­tling for tem­po­rary jobs or trainee­ships while hold­ing out for bet­ter op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions Pop­u­la­tion Fund has also pro­jected that birth rates will con­tinue to drop in many higher-in­come coun­tries and climb in many poor and mid­dle-in­come na­tions, where it says pan­demic-driven dis­rup­tion in ac­cess to con­tra­cep­tion may lead to mil­lions of un­planned preg­nan­cies.</p>
    <p>This trend is borne out in Ja­pan, where the num­ber of re­ported preg­nan­cies na­tion­wide fell 11.4 per cent be­tween May and July, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, due to ris­ing eco­nomic pres­sures from the out­break.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, 77 per cent of 1,754 mar­ried women aged 18 to 40 who were sur­veyed in In­done­sia from Sept 3 to Sept 10 were preg­nant dur­ing the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to mar­ket re­search firm Pop­ulix.</p>
    <p>In de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, a surge in birth rates may snow­ball into wider in­equal­ity gaps, while de­vel­oped coun­tries like Ja­pan, Sin­ga­pore and China may face a tight­ened labour sup­ply if birth rates con­tinue to fall, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>Hous­ing mar­kets in In­done­sia, China and Malaysia have also been hit, though some prospec­tive home own­ers still find op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, for in­stance, more mil­len­ni­als are look­ing into buy­ing a home, given that they are spend­ing most of their time in­doors in the Covid-19 era, says Mr Ankit Kansal, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of prop­erty bro­ker­age firm 360 Real­tors.</p>
    <p>Whether th­ese eco­nomic and so­cial trends will curb the po­ten­tial of Asia’s economies, which are ex­pected to con­trib­ute about 60 per cent of global growth by 2030, will de­pend on how long the pan­demic drags on and the qual­ity of gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion mea­sures to mit</p>
    <p>MORE ROADS TO SUC­CESS</p>
    <p>(Youth) can take more paths to suc­cess com­pared with the older gen­er­a­tion, such as by cap­i­tal­is­ing on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>MR TOMMY XIE, OCBC Bank head of Greater China re­search, on new op­por­tu­ni­ties from tech changes has­tened by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>LAST­ING NEG­A­TIVE IM­PACT</p>
    <p>The longer the cur­rent cri­sis lasts, the harder it is for the youth to re­cover from its neg­a­tive im­pact. With no ef­fec­tive in­ter­ven­tions, they could very well be­come a lost gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR JEAN YE­UNG, found­ing di­rec­tor of the Centre for Fam­ily and Pop­u­la­tion Re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>igate the im­pact of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>More train­ing, in­tern­ships and men­tor­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties must be pro­vided to young peo­ple, and vul­ner­a­ble groups, such as lower-in­come fam­i­lies, need more pro­tec­tion, says Prof Ye­ung.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, more than 117,500 jobs and train­ing and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties have been cre­ated for lo­cal job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has also been tak­ing steps to dis­cour­age firms from re­trench­ing work­ers, says OCBC Bank head of Greater China re­search Tommy Xie, who is op­ti­mistic that the tech­no­log­i­cal changes has­tened by the pan­demic will give the young new op­por­tu­ni­ties, as they “can take more paths to suc­cess com­pared with the older gen­er­a­tion, such as by cap­i­tal­is­ing on so­cial me­dia”.</p>
    <p>Adds OCBC econ­o­mist Wel­lian Wi­ranto: “If the global econ­omy can get back to some kind of nor­malcy by the end of next year, we prob­a­bly still have a chance of re­vert­ing to (pre-pan­demic) po­ten­tial growth lev­els.”</p>

    <p>With the re­gion still grap­pling with the eco­nomic fall­out from the pan­demic, the prospects of a ‘lost gen­er­a­tion’ are ris­ing. Will Asia’s youth be scarred eco­nom­i­cally, so­cially and psy­cho­log­i­cally by the far-reach­ing ef­fects of the cri­sis – or find new paths to achieve their as­pi­ra­tions?</p>
