    <p>WASHINGTON • The United States has slapped fresh sanc­tions on Iran’s fi­nan­cial sec­tor, tar­get­ing 18 banks in an ef­fort to fur­ther choke off Ira­nian rev­enues as Washington ramps up pres­sure on Te­heran weeks ahead of the US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The move yes­ter­day freezes any US as­sets of those black­listed and gen­er­ally bars Amer­i­cans from deal­ing with them, while ex­tend­ing sec­ondary sanc­tions to those who do business with them. This means for­eign banks risk los­ing ac­cess to the US mar­ket and fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury De­part­ment said in a state­ment the pro­hi­bi­tions did not ap­ply to trans­ac­tions to sell agri­cul­tural com­modi­ties, food, medicine or med­i­cal de­vices to Iran, say­ing it un­der­stood the need for hu­man­i­tar­ian goods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ira­nian For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif ac­cused the US of tar­get­ing Iran’s abil­ity to pay for ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“US regime wants to blow up our re­main­ing chan­nels to pay for food & medicine,” Mr Zarif said on Twit­ter. “Con­spir­ing to starve a pop­u­la­tion is a crime against hu­man­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ira­nian Cen­tral Bank gov­er­nor Ab­dol­naser Hem­mati dis­missed the sanc­tions as po­lit­i­cal pro­pa­ganda and played down their prac­ti­cal im­pact. “Rather than hav­ing any eco­nomic ef­fect, the Amer­i­can move is for US do­mes­tic pro­pa­ganda and po­lit­i­cal pur­poses, and shows the fal­sity of the hu­man rights and hu­man­i­tar­ian claims of US lead­ers,” Mr Hem­mati said.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the sec­ondary sanc­tions may fur­ther de­ter Euro­pean and other for­eign banks from work­ing with Iran, even for per­mit­ted hu­man­i­tar­ian trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s like a punch in the face to the Euro­peans, who have gone out of their way to in­di­cate to the Amer­i­cans that they view it as be­ing ex­tremely threat­en­ing to hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance or hu­man­i­tar­ian trade go­ing to Iran,” said Ms El­iz­a­beth Rosenberg of the Cen­tre for a New Amer­i­can Se­cu­rity think­tank.</p>
    <p>“They also want... to make it very dif­fi­cult for any fu­ture pres­i­dent to be able to un­wind these mea­sures and en­gage in nu­clear diplo­macy,” Ms Rosenberg added.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den, who was vice-pres­i­dent when the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion ne­go­ti­ated the Iran nu­clear ac­cord, has said he would re­join the deal if Te­heran first re­sumed com­pli­ance with it.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween Washington and Te­heran have soared since Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump uni­lat­er­ally with­drew in 2018 from the 2015 Iran nu­clear deal struck by his pre­de­ces­sor and be­gan re-im­pos­ing US sanc­tions that had been eased un­der the ac­cord.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions Mr Trump has re­in­stated tar­get ev­ery­thing from oil sales to ship­ping and fi­nan­cial ac­tiv­i­ties. While they ex­empt food, medicine and other hu­man­i­tar­ian sup­plies, many for­eign banks are al­ready de­terred from do­ing business with the Is­lamic Re­pub­lic – in­clud­ing for hu­man­i­tar­ian deals.</p>
