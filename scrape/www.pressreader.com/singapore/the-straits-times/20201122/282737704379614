    <p>IN­GRE­DI­ENTS</p>
    <p>135g to 150g whole milk</p>
    <p>20g un­salted but­ter</p>
    <p>300g bread flour</p>
    <p>5g sugar</p>
    <p>7g salt</p>
    <p>5g in­stant yeast</p>
    <p>1 egg</p>
    <p>Corn­meal or semolina flour for dust­ing Grape­seed or olive oil</p>
    <p>METHOD</p>
    <p>1. Weigh out 135g of whole milk and the 20g of but­ter into a saucepan and heat un­til luke­warm. I mi­crowave but­ter and milk from the fridge on high for 40 sec­onds in a pour­ing jug. Set aside.</p>
    <p>2. Weigh the bread flour, sugar, salt and in­stant yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer or into a mix­ing bowl. The salt and yeast should not touch ini­tially, as salt can de­ac­ti­vate the yeast. Use a spoon to mix the dry in­gre­di­ents to­gether. Crack in the egg, add the milk and but­ter mix­ture.</p>
    <p>3. If us­ing a stand mixer, fit it with a dough hook and mix on medium – level 4 on the KitchenAid Ar­ti­san, for two min­utes. If there is loose flour at the bot­tom of the bowl, add the re­main­ing 15g of milk. Mix un­til the in­gre­di­ents come to­gether.</p>
    <p>4. If work­ing by hand, bring the shaggy mass to­gether with a dough scraper and shape the dough into a ball. Knead for 10 min­utes, or un­til you get a smooth, slightly sticky dough. Place the dough back into the bowl – no need to oil the bowl or the dough – and cover with plas­tic wrap. Let it proof for 60 min­utes.</p>
    <p>5. If us­ing the stand mixer, knead for eight to 10 min­utes on low speed – level 2 on the KitchenAid Ar­ti­san, paus­ing ev­ery two to three min­utes to scrape the dough off the hook and to turn the dough over so the bot­tom is on top. This is to make sure the dough is kneaded evenly. You will no­tice that while it clears the side of the bowl, it sticks to the bot­tom. Knead un­til the dough is smooth and slightly sticky. Shape it into a ball. Place it back in the bowl of the stand mixer, cover with plas­tic wrap and proof for 60 min­utes.</p>
    <p>7. Af­ter the first proof, de­flate the dough us­ing a bench scraper. Di­vide it into six pieces, each weigh­ing about 88g. Pat one piece out into a rough cir­cle on a clean work sur­face (no need for bench flour) and bring the cir­cum­fer­ence into the mid­dle, like you are wrapping some­thing in the dough. Pinch to se­cure. Over­turn the ball and place your hand over it. Then, like you are mov­ing a com­puter mouse, roll it in a cir­cu­lar mo­tion to form a neat ball. Re­peat with the other five pieces. Cover the balls with a tea towel and let them rest for 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>8. Un­cover the balls. Sprin­kle corn­meal on a clean tray that will hold all six balls with­out them touch­ing. Take one ball, flat­ten the top gen­tly with your hand on a clean work sur­face. Place it on the tray and sprin­kle more corn­meal on top. Re­peat with the re­main­ing five balls, giv­ing them enough room apart on the tray to ex­pand. Cover the tray with a tea towel and proof for 35 min­utes. 9. Place a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Brush with oil. Place three or four muffins on the pan – they should not touch – and cook one minute. Turn the heat down to medium and con­tinue cook­ing for three to four min­utes, or un­til the bot­tom is golden brown. Flip the muf­fin over. Lightly press down each one with a spat­ula and cook over medium-low heat an­other four to five min­utes. Trans­fer onto a wire rack to cool. Cook the re­main­ing muffins the same way, re­mem­ber­ing to oil the pan for sub­se­quent batches.</p>
    <p>10. Cool com­pletely – best to make them they day be­fore you plan to eat them. To eat, split the muffins in half by stick­ing the tines of a fork all around the cir­cum­fer­ence of the muf­fin (left). It should come apart (left, be­low) and the rough sur­faces will al­low more but­ter to soak in. Toast and make a break­fast sand­wich by but­ter­ing both sides, and fill­ing the muf­fin with slices of cheese and ham, and a fried or scram­bled egg.</p>
    <p>Serves six</p>
