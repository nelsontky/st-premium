    <p>Fix­ing the tran­sat­lantic re­la­tion­ship is high on the agenda of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den. The nom­i­na­tion of Mr Antony Blinken, a de­fender of global al­liances, for the post of sec­re­tary of state in­di­cates that Mr Bi­den wants to mend the many rifts he will in­herit from Mr Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>How­ever, even post-Trump, a deep-rooted wari­ness about the fu­ture re­li­a­bil­ity of the United States will not eas­ily go away among Nato part­ners in Europe. This is es­pe­cially as the out­go­ing Pres­i­dent sowed the seeds of doubt about US com­mit­ment to the guar­an­tee of mu­tual as­sis­tance in the event of a mil­i­tary con­flict.</p>
    <p>This pro­vi­sion, in Ar­ti­cle 5 of the Nato treaty, is the cen­tre­piece of the Western mil­i­tary al­liance. If con­tin­u­ously ques­tioned, the whole al­liance is in jeop­ardy.</p>
    <p>Al­though with Mr Bi­den at the helm the tran­sat­lantic re­la­tion­ship is likely to en­joy a breather over the next four years, many ob­servers are afraid that this may only be an in­ter­lude. Mr Trump’s fan base is im­pres­sively strong and it can’t be ruled out that in 2025, Mr Bi­den will be fol­lowed by an­other Repub­li­can ad­vo­cat­ing an “Amer­ica First” agenda.</p>
    <p>To not be caught wrong-footed again, Europe is de­bat­ing how to make best use of the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>Wait­ing things out – the Euro­pean strat­egy over the past four years – will not work as a blue­print for an­other pop­ulist pres­i­dency. How­ever, Ger­many’s Min­is­ter of De­fence An­negret Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer does not show any in­cli­na­tion to­wards fun­da­men­tally re­think­ing Europe’s se­cu­rity ap­proach.</p>
    <p>AU­TON­OMY AN ‘IL­LU­SION’</p>
    <p>In an op-ed this month for the US me­dia platform Politico, she re­jected the idea that Euro­peans should take se­cu­rity into their own hands and be­come more in­de­pen­dent from Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“Il­lu­sions of Euro­pean strate­gic au­ton­omy must come to an end: Euro­peans will not be able to re­place Amer­ica’s cru­cial role as a se­cu­rity provider,” she de­creed.</p>
    <p>Ms Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer was al­lud­ing to the US’ undis­puted dom­i­nant role within Nato. Roughly 75 per cent of over­all Nato ex­pen­di­tures is cov­ered by the US. With 1.3 mil­lion mil­i­tary per­son­nel, and an an­nual spend­ing for its mil­i­tary of more than 3 per cent, the US far out­paces the rest.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter Ms Kram­pKar­ren­bauer’s guest com­men­tary, French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron de­liv­ered a re­sound­ing re­sponse, call­ing her state­ment “a his­tor­i­cal mis­in­ter­pre­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>He laid out his think­ing in Le Grand Con­ti­nent, a jour­nal pub­lished by French think-tank Groupe d’etudes geopoli­tiques.</p>
    <p>The con­trast be­tween him and the Ger­man min­is­ter could not be more stark. While the French Pres­i­dent adopted an in­tel­lec­tual ap­proach in ex­plain­ing his vi­sion for an em­pow­ered Europe that has learnt from the past, Ms Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer, in her dry style, stated the ob­vi­ous.</p>
    <p>It did not slip the at­ten­tion of Mr Macron that Europe – at least for the time be­ing – would be un­able to fill the se­cu­rity gap were the US to un­fas­ten its mil­i­tary com­mit­ments in Europe.</p>
    <p>LACK OF PER­SPEC­TIVE</p>
    <p>Ms Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer, how­ever, dis­missed, right from the start, the idea of a new Euro­pean role.</p>
    <p>To be sure, Ger­many in the past 30 years has very grad­u­ally and ten­ta­tively taken on more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in global se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>De­fence ex­pen­di­ture is still mod­est and at around 1.5 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, way be­low the bench­mark spend­ing of an an­nual 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sim­ply say­ing that Europe can­not en­vis­age a life with­out the pro­tec­tion of the Amer­i­can se­cu­rity um­brella shows a fun­da­men­tal lack of per­spec­tive and imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>True, Ger­man mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­ity is far from im­pres­sive. Long-over­due mod­erni­sa­tion of mil­i­tary equip­ment is pro­gress­ing only slowly, per­son­nel is in­suf­fi­cient and bu­reau­cracy is wide­spread. Op­er­a­tional readi­ness of the main weapons sys­tems is es­ti­mated at a mea­gre 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ger­many to­day is pay­ing a price for the con­tin­ued down­scal­ing of its army. Heav­ily ben­e­fit­ing from the so-called peace div­i­dend af­ter the end of the Cold War, it sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced spend­ing.</p>
    <p>While in 1989 de­fence con­sumed around 20 per cent of the over­all Ger­man bud­get, last year this was 12 per cent.</p>
    <p>This is hap­pen­ing de­spite a fun­da­men­tal change in the Euro­pean se­cu­rity land­scape.</p>
    <p>With the an­nex­a­tion of the Crimean penin­sula and the sup­port of sep­a­ratists in eastern Ukraine in 2014, Rus­sia has re­turned to a far more bel­li­cose path­way. How­ever, it has taken years for Ger­many to ac­knowl­edge and re­act to the new threats.</p>
    <p>The state of the army mir­rors pub­lic sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>De­bat­ing the fu­ture of Euro­pean se­cu­rity, new mil­i­tary strate­gies and pos­si­ble fur­ther spend­ing in</p>
    <p>Ger­many is a balanc­ing act.</p>
    <p>The topic is not pop­u­lar and not one with which to win elec­tions. Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, al­ways wary of the pub­lic mood, has been cau­tious in ad­dress­ing the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing Amer­i­can pro­tec­tion seems to be a con­ve­nient way of skirt­ing the is­sue. What Ber­lin is over­look­ing, though, is some golden op­por­tu­ni­ties. Mr Macron and his min­is­ters are prob­a­bly one of the most Ger­man-friendly French gov­ern­ments in a long time.</p>
    <p>But in­stead of sup­port­ing them, Ber­lin has re­buked them.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­tedly, the French love for grand ges­tures does not res­onate with Ger­mans. But with the Bri­tish out of the Euro­pean Union – al­though they re­main part of the Euro­pean Com­mon Se­cu­rity and De­fence Pol­icy – Ber­lin would do bet­ter to close ranks with Paris.</p>
    <p>As for the US, Ms Kramp-Kar­ren­bauer may also have mis­read the signs of the times. What Mr Bi­den and his team are look­ing for is al­most cer­tainly not a Europe sur­ren­der­ing it­self to the US – to the con­trary.</p>
    <p>The more Europe gets its act to­gether, the bet­ter. Mr Bi­den will not only be busy deal­ing with the grave di­vi­sions that have emerged within Amer­i­can so­ci­ety. He will have to look in­tensely at China and Asia. Af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump walked away from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade deal, he made room for China to fill the void. The at­ten­tion of the US, there­fore, will be con­sumed by an in­creas­ingly dom­i­nant China. A Europe defin­ing its own strate­gic au­ton­omy might even be very wel­come.</p>
