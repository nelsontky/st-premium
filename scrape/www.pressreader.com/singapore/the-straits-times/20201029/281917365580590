    <p>Al­le­ga­tions of Rus­sian and Ira­nian in­ter­fer­ence in the up­com­ing Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­tion re­veal the vul­ner­a­bil­ity of do­mes­tic pol­i­tics to ex­ter­nal dig­i­tal ma­nip­u­la­tion. While most cit­i­zens of any coun­try would re­act with an in­stinc­tive re­jec­tion of at­tempts by for­eign­ers to chart their po­lit­i­cal fu­ture, the lines are drawn less clearly when it comes to do­mes­tic sources of in­ter­fer­ence that em­ploy the anony­mous re­sources of the In­ter­net to ne­far­i­ous ends. When even a ma­ture democ­racy such as the United States is far from be­ing im­mune to mis­in­for­ma­tion and dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns by dis­grun­tled cit­i­zens or vested-in­ter­est groups, the ques­tion then is what can na­tions do to pre­vent, or at least to blunt, malev­o­lent do­mes­tic dig­i­tal acts from un­der­min­ing the elec­toral le­git­i­macy of their own democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral egre­gious cases of at­tempts to frighten, di­vide or oth­er­wise ma­nip­u­late pub­lic opin­ion have been doc­u­mented in the US. Face­book posts warned vot­ers falsely that their bal­lots would be­come in­valid if a poll worker put a mark on it. A tweet said that Democrats would vote on Nov 3 – the ac­tual polling date – and Repub­li­cans would vote the day af­ter be­cause of Covid-19 re­stric­tions. It was also claimed that a per­son could go on­line and change votes. Such disin­gen­u­ous at­tempts are the on­line ver­sion of fake news cam­paigns us­ing other me­dia – such as robo­calls made to sev­eral thou­sand mi­nor­ity vot­ers in</p>
    <p>Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia, Ohio, Illi­nois and New York which tried to dis­suade them from vot­ing by mail be­cause it ap­par­ently could en­dan­ger the pri­vacy of their per­sonal in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Not un­sur­pris­ingly, fringe news groups can am­plify the reach of fake in­for­ma­tion cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia and give it a tinge of cred­i­bil­ity. The net ef­fect is that vot­ers could be swayed from their au­ton­o­mous elec­toral pref­er­ences or lose faith in the very in­tegrity of the elec­tion process. The peo­ple and or­gan­i­sa­tions be­hind this ma­nip­u­la­tion have no stake in Amer­ica’s col­lec­tive po­lit­i­cal fu­ture, but only in achiev­ing out­comes that re­flect their vested in­ter­ests. It is too much to ex­pect ser­vice providers to po­lice the spread of in­for­ma­tion on­line – and its at­ten­dant dan­gers of mis­in­for­ma­tion and dis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Moves to check these dan­gers in­evitably raise fears about of­fi­cial at­tempts to con­trol the news. Yet, in the ab­sence of a sin­gle in­ter­na­tional pro­to­col to pro­tect cit­i­zens from the in­vid­i­ous spread of fake news, coun­tries must fight the menace with the means at their dis­posal, us­ing tools that en­joy the trust and sanc­tion of their peo­ple. In an ideal world, puni­tive laws against fake news, whether dur­ing, be­fore or af­ter an elec­tion, would be un­nec­es­sary. But in the real world, laws must com­ple­ment the civic con­scious­ness of cit­i­zens to en­sure that so­cial me­dia is not used to hold the pub­lic and demo­cratic elec­tions hostage.</p>
