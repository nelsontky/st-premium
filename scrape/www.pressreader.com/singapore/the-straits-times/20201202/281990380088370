    <p>In sup­port of Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh’s ap­peal to Europe for tol­er­ance of and re­spect for the faiths of oth­ers, may I sug­gest that we stop con­flat­ing “right” with “free­dom” (Free­dom of speech: An ap­peal to Europe, Nov 28)?</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, how­ever, this con­fla­tion is also ev­i­dent in Prof Koh’s state­ment: “The cen­tral ques­tion is whether free­dom of speech in­cludes the right to slan­der Is­lam or any other re­li­gion.”</p>
    <p>The words “free­dom” and “right” have dif­fer­ent mean­ings.</p>
    <p>There is no need for such a ques­tion be­cause it is akin to ask­ing whether the weight of fruit in­cludes the colour of or­anges. But I un­der­stand Prof Koh’s no­ble in­tent in ques­tion­ing the link be­tween the two.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, it is this con­tin­ued con­fla­tion that con­fuses and then em­bold­ens many in Europe to as­sert that free­dom of speech en­tails the right to of­fend. Many fal­la­ciously con­clude that free­dom of speech, which im­plies free­dom to of­fend, equals the right to of­fend – be­cause free­dom and rights are seen as one and the same.</p>
    <p>Free­dom of speech, ac­tion and thought is an un­de­ni­able hu­man con­di­tion aris­ing from our in­nate free will. But while hu­man free­dom is un­de­ni­ably in­nate, the idea that hu­man rights are equally so is de­bat­able.</p>
    <p>Thus, since time im­memo­rial, there have been so­ci­eties de­ter­min­ing and then grant­ing or deny­ing their mem­bers the rights to ex­er­cise what­ever in­nate hu­man free­doms they have.</p>
    <p>The crim­i­nal­i­sa­tion of Holo­caust de­nial is an ex­cel­lent ex­am­ple of “the right to ex­er­cise the free­dom to deny a his­tor­i­cal event” be­ing de­ter­mined and then, in this case, de­nied by Euro­pean so­ci­ety. Sim­ply put, if you are free to deny, it does not mean you have the right to do so. That right de­pends on what your so­ci­ety de­fines.</p>
    <p>Right now, Europe could do with a proper dis­tinc­tion be­tween hu­man free­dom and hu­man rights. It could then ju­di­ciously de­ter­mine whether grant­ing its so­ci­eties the right to of­fend is the right thing to do, notwith­stand­ing the in­nate hu­man free will.</p>
    <p>Many fal­la­ciously con­clude that free­dom of speech, which im­plies free­dom to of­fend, equals the right to of­fend – be­cause free­dom and rights are seen as one and the same.</p>
