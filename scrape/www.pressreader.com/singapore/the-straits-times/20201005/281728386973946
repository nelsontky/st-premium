    <p>WASHINGTON US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo will shorten his travel to Asia this week as the White House deals with the spread of the coro­n­avirus among its top of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo was set to ar­rive in Tokyo yes­ter­day. He will stay till to­mor­row for a meet­ing of the for­eign min­is­ters of four of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion’s big­gest democ­ra­cies, State De­part­ment spokesman Mor­gan Orta­gus said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>His ear­lier itin­er­ary in­cluded trips to Mon­go­lia and South Korea from to­mor­row to Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump entered the hos­pi­tal last Fri­day evening af­ter an­nounc­ing ear­lier in the day that he and First Lady Me­la­nia Trump had been di­ag­nosed with Covid-19. His is</p>
    <p>the most prom­i­nent case in what has be­come an out­break of coro­n­avirus among top Repub­li­can lead­ers, and Mr Trump’s in­ner cir­cle.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Pom­peo and his wife have tested neg­a­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>The US Sec­re­tary of State is meet­ing the for­eign min­is­ters of Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia – the so-called Quad group seen as a counter to China’s in­flu­ence in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has made clear its op­po­si­tion to the US’ “Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy”, which was con­ceived to el­e­vate In­dia as a po­ten­tial re­gional coun­ter­weight to China.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing is also one of the high­est-pro­file diplo­matic gath­er­ings for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion be­fore the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, where pol­icy to­wards Bei­jing has be­come a ma­jor cam­paign is­sue.</p>
    <p>It also comes as China and In­dia try to defuse ten­sions on their dis­puted Hi­malayan bor­der, af­ter a mil­i­tary stand-off led to gun­shots be­ing fired over the fron­tier for the first time since 1975.</p>
    <p>The Quad gath­er­ing will fo­cus on press­ing is­sues of the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, Ms Orta­gus said.</p>
    <p>“Sec­re­tary Pom­peo ex­pects to be trav­el­ling to Asia again in Oc­to­ber and will work to resched­ule vis­its on that trip, that is now just a few weeks off,” she said.</p>
