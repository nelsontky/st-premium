    <p>A man who wrote a sex­ual fan­tasy story planted cam­eras in var­i­ous bath­rooms, in­clud­ing his own, to record his fam­ily mem­bers and church friends show­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old then in­cor­po­rated screen­shots of these voyeuris­tic videos into his fan­tasy story on sex-themed fo­rum Sam­my­boy, to get more at­ten­tion from peo­ple on the fo­rum.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the man, who can­not be named to pro­tect the iden­ti­ties of his vic­tims, was sen­tenced to 28 weeks’ jail and fined $6,000. He had ear­lier pleaded guilty to 11 charges re­lat­ing to his voyeuris­tic ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An­other 16 sim­i­lar charges were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments showed that the man had shot voyeuris­tic videos of his wife, sis­ter-in-law, and church and fam­ily friends from 2008, by plant­ing pin­hole cam­eras into homes he had ac­cess to.</p>
    <p>The man started post­ing sex­ual com­ments on the Sam­my­boy web­site as the fo­rum had a points sys­tem to rate users.</p>
    <p>He also did it as he “felt ac­cepted in the Sam­my­boy fo­rum com­mu­nity and felt that (peo­ple in) the church com­mu­nity were hyp­ocrites”, said Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor R. Arvin­dren in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Over sev­eral years, the man hid se­cret cam­eras in his house, his sis­ter-in-law’s house and the house of a fam­ily friend.</p>
    <p>The man planted a cam­era in his fam­ily friend’s home af­ter she al­lowed him to use her bath­room fol­low­ing their usual jog­ging ses­sions with church mem­bers.</p>
    <p>He then recorded a video of the woman show­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The man also in­vited his child­hood friend and his church men­tor to his home af­ter sep­a­rate jog­ging ses­sions, and used the cam­eras in­stalled in his bath­room to record videos of them show­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The man in­cor­po­rated screen­shots of some of these videos into the sex­ual fan­tasy story he had writ­ten on Sam­my­boy.</p>
    <p>He got bored of writ­ing and stopped af­ter about two years, said DPP Arvin­dren.</p>
    <p>“Not want­ing to lose his read­er­ship, the ac­cused de­vel­oped a few ideas to keep his read­er­ship up and gain more points on Sam­my­boy fo­rum. Be­sides screen­shot­ting videos, the ac­cused went onto Face­book and down­loaded the first vic­tim’s photo,” he said.</p>
    <p>He posted this photo on the fo­rum with a sex­u­ally ex­plicit com­ment.</p>
    <p>He re­peated this with other vic­tims, in­clud­ing his church men­tor and sis­ter-in-law.</p>
    <p>The man was ex­posed when one of his vic­tims was told by her friend that her naked pho­tos were on the web­site. The woman lodged a po­lice re­port on Oct 10, 2016.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing sen­tenc­ing yes­ter­day, Dis­trict Judge Adam Nakhoda noted that the man was di­ag­nosed with voyeurism or para­philia, a con­di­tion char­ac­terised by ab­nor­mal sex­ual de­sires, but said this did not af­fect his impulse con­trol.</p>
    <p>The judge, how­ever, said he noted that the man had co­op­er­ated with the po­lice and had wanted to apol­o­gise to his vic­tims.</p>
    <p>With the amend­ments to the Pe­nal Code last year, those con­victed of voyeurism now face up to two years’ jail, can­ing and a fine.</p>
