    <p>James Lopez Chua used to lis­ten to songs by Justin Bieber and Des­tiny’s Child dur­ing his hour-long runs six times a week.</p>
    <p>But, dur­ing Phase 1 of the cir­cuit breaker in April, the 23-year-old re­alised that he could make bet­ter use of those six hours and switched to lis­ten­ing to pod­casts about self­im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>“I’m a pro­duc­tiv­ity mon­ster. I need to make sure my day is as ef­fi­cient as pos­si­ble and, if I can kill two birds with one stone dur­ing that one hour, I will,” the project ex­ec­u­tive at a pro­duc­tion house told The Sun­day Times. “I re­alised that I wanted to make full use of my time and start learn­ing more stuff.</p>
    <p>“In that one hour, I can be lis­ten­ing to sense­less mu­sic or I can be ac­tively learn­ing. When I’m lis­ten­ing to pod­casts while run­ning, I will be think­ing more about the learn­ing points of the podcast so my brain is con­stantly pro­cess­ing in­for­ma­tion rather than brain­lessly mov­ing, so I think that’s more pro­duc­tive.”</p>
    <p>Pod­casts are a fast-grow­ing medium that pro­vides run­ners with an al­ter­na­tive to mu­sic, which is known to en­hance per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>With pod­casts ac­com­pa­ny­ing him, Chua will at­tempt to com­plete 175km in three weeks for the sold­out The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR) 2020.</p>
    <p>The STVR has two cat­e­gories – 17.5km and 175km. The race pe­riod for the 17.5km run is Oct 9-18, while the 175km run is from Oct 19-Dec 17. Run­ners can record their dis­tances over sev­eral ses­sions.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways like chal­lenges, so I’d rather push my body and com­plete the dis­tance in the short­est time pos­si­ble than pro­long it,” said Chua, who has rec­om­mended friends to lis­ten to pod­casts while they are run­ning. “Self-im­prove­ment is for ev­ery­one, so why not rec­om­mend some­thing that might help them in a small way.”</p>
    <p>One of the peo­ple he has in­flu­enced is fi­nal-year busi­ness stu­dent Lin Guixin, 23, who used to lis­ten to up­beat songs dur­ing her weekly runs. Now, she lis­tens to fi­nan­cial pod­casts like Snacks Daily and they help to take her fo­cus away from run­ning, mak­ing it a less painful process.</p>
    <p>Na­tional track ath­lete Melvin Wong, 37, agreed that pod­casts are a good dis­trac­tion, as he thinks about the con­ver­sa­tion or topic in­stead, and are es­pe­cially help­ful on long runs.</p>
    <p>“I won’t get men­tally burnt out by only think­ing of try­ing to com­plete the run as soon as pos­si­ble,” said Wong, who rep­re­sented Sin­ga­pore at the 2015 SEA Games in the 5,000m and 10,000m.</p>
    <p>For ar­chi­tect Jonathan Lin, 35, mu­sic is too dis­tract­ing, es­pe­cially dur­ing his 10-12km runs, so he switched to pod­casts four years ago. He said: “When I run longer dis­tances, I want a con­sis­tent pace and don’t want sud­den changes in beat to af­fect my run­ning. Pod­casts are con­sis­tent and help me fo­cus more on my breath­ing.”</p>
    <p>But some run­ners are stick­ing to mu­sic, as they pre­fer not to have their mind en­gaged while run­ning and feel mo­ti­vated by the tempo and lyrics of songs.</p>
    <p>Dr Gwen Lim, 39, found pod­casts too dis­tract­ing.</p>
    <p>“I was try­ing to lis­ten to what the speaker is say­ing and con­cen­trat­ing on my run at the same time but I just can’t do two things at once... Mu­sic puts me in the zone and makes my runs more in­ter­est­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>Re­search en­gi­neer Muham­mad</p>
    <p>Adri Abu Bakar, 29, who will run 175km in the STVR, said: “Run­ning is a way for me to get away from hav­ing to use my brain. It’s a way to not have to lis­ten to or think about any­thing.”</p>
    <p>His playlist dif­fers based on the type of run he is do­ing. He usu­ally lis­tens to elec­tronic dance mu­sic dur­ing tempo runs and up­beat pop songs when he wants to re­lax dur­ing long-dis­tance runs.</p>
    <p>When he is try­ing to achieve a tar­get run­ning ca­dence, he lis­tens to songs at 180 beats per minute.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy lec­turer Kevin Tan, who runs three to four times a week, added that be­sides rhythm, the lyrics of songs spur him on dur­ing his runs as well.</p>
    <p>Em­pire State Of Mind re­minds the 51-year-old of his time work­ing in New York City 10 years ago, when he would run in Cen­tral Park with his wife and friends.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­minded of when I was fit­ter,” he said. “I get re­newed en­ergy lis­ten­ing to it as it re­minds me that if I could do it then, I can do it now.”</p>
    <p>Sport and ex­er­cise psy­chol­o­gist John Wang, a pro­fes­sor at the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion, said mu­sic can en­hance per­for­mance by 10 to 15 per cent. This can be achieved through mo­ti­va­tion from lyrics and match­ing run­ning speed to the beat of the mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Prof Wang added: “Mu­sic can en­hance or cre­ate images in your mind, so lis­ten­ing to a par­tic­u­lar piece of mu­sic can bring about cer­tain emotions and images in peo­ple’s minds that en­hance per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“Mu­sic also serves as a dis­trac­tion so if you’re ex­ert­ing a lot of ef­fort, you might be in pain and you feel like you can’t go on any more. By lis­ten­ing to mu­sic, you will for­get about your pain and suf­fer­ing be­cause you will shift your at­ten­tion to the mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>But he noted that the same can be achieved with other forms of au­dio, in­clud­ing pod­casts.</p>
    <p>He said: “As long as there’s sound, it’ll be the same be­cause any sound can cre­ate images that have the same ef­fect.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Lis&#xAD;ten&#xAD;ing to mu&#xAD;sic while work&#xAD;ing out can en&#xAD;hance per&#xAD;for&#xAD;mance, as songs are mo&#xAD;ti&#xAD;va&#xAD;tional and pro&#xAD;vide tempo. Pod&#xAD;casts, while slower, can also aid run&#xAD;ners and of&#xAD;fer an al&#xAD;ter&#xAD;na&#xAD;tive to mu&#xAD;sic.</p>
