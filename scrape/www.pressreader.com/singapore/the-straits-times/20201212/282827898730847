    <p>I have been keep­ing this plant (right) for a few years, but I do not know its name. The roots seem to be pro­trud­ing out of the soil. I wa­ter the plant spar­ingly a few times a week be­cause the pot does not have drainage holes and the plant has new leaves re­cently. It seems to be slow­grow­ing. Would it be nec­es­sary to re­plant it in the soil or re­pot it in a drain­able pot with new suit­able soil?</p>

    <p>The plant is com­monly known as the baby rub­ber plant. Its botan­i­cal name is Peper­o­mia ob­tusi­fo­lia.</p>
    <p>It ap­pears that your plant is grow­ing in a rather clayey soil mix, which is not rec­om­mended for grow­ing plants in con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>A clayey soil mix is fine and tends to com­pact down, lead­ing to aer­a­tion and drainage is­sues.</p>
    <p>The soil mix has set­tled around the plant, ex­pos­ing the root ball. This can lead to the root ball dry­ing out.</p>
    <p>This plant is also not tol­er­ant to wet feet and can rot if the root zone is wet.</p>
    <p>You may want to move the plant out of its cur­rent pot and grow­ing mix into a con­tainer with a drainage hole, so you can have bet­ter con­trol of the mois­ture level of the root zone.</p>
    <p>Use a soil-less mix gen­er­ally suit­able for pot­ting up house plants. It should con­tain peat moss, ver­mi­culite, per­lite and other ma­te­ri­als that make the mix more por­ous and friable, which pro­vides bet­ter drainage and aer­a­tion and is less likely to com­pact down over time.</p>
