    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s planned de­par­ture from of­fice is rais­ing hopes that the strained re­la­tions be­tween Seoul and Tokyo might at last be­gin to see some im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>Days af­ter be­com­ing Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing premier, Mr Abe an­nounced his in­tent to step down due to a chronic ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his cur­rent ten­ure, which be­gan in 2012, Seoul-Tokyo ties have reached a low ebb over is­sues stem­ming from Ja­pan’s 1910-45 colo­nial rule of the Korean penin­sula.</p>
    <p>Dis­cord over long-sim­mer­ing is­sues such as wartime sex­ual slav­ery and forced labour has con­tin­ued to deepen, with Mr Abe’s con­ser­va­tive govern­ment re­fus­ing to ac­cede to the calls of South Korean vic­tims for a mean­ing­ful apol­ogy and for­mal repa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>Through­out his stint as prime min­is­ter, Mr Abe has taken a harder stance on Seoul than any of his pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>Last year, he pressed Tokyo’s trade of­fi­cials to im­pose curbs on the ex­port of high-tech ma­te­ri­als to South Korea in what ap­peared to be a po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated reprisal for two rul­ings by the Supreme Court in 2018 or­der­ing Ja­panese firms to com­pen­sate South Kore­ans forced to work in their plants and mines dur­ing the colo­nial era.</p>
    <p>Later, Ja­pan dropped South Korea from its list of pref­er­en­tial trad­ing part­ners. Seoul re­sponded by fil­ing a com­plaint with the</p>
    <p>World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion over the ex­port re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>It also vowed not to re­new its mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence-shar­ing ac­cord with Tokyo, though it shelved the pledge at the last minute due to op­po­si­tion from the United States, which sees the pact as a cru­cial tool to en­hance tri­lat­eral se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion with its two key Asian al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s de­par­ture can hardly be ex­pected to have an im­me­di­ate and sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on the frayed ties be­tween Seoul and Tokyo, given that who­ever suc­ceeds him will likely fol­low his pol­icy line.</p>
    <p>Still, there is the pos­si­bil­ity that the new Ja­panese ad­min­is­tra­tion may re­lax mea­sures driven mainly by Mr Abe’s per­sonal will – such as the ex­port curbs, which have been crit­i­cised for dam­ag­ing the economies of both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>If Seoul re­sponds to any such pos­i­tive move from Tokyo by tak­ing a more for­ward-look­ing ap­proach to his­tor­i­cal is­sues, bi­lat­eral ties could fi­nally move be­yond their worst level since they were nor­malised in 1965.</p>
    <p>New PM must han­dle Asean with care</p>
    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post, In­done­sia</p>
    <p>What will be the reper­cus­sions of Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s res­ig­na­tion on the world, es­pe­cially Asia?</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is the world’s third-most pow­er­ful econ­omy af­ter the United States and China, which is why other coun­tries will closely fol­low the suc­ces­sion plans in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s right-hand man Yoshi­hide Suga, who is also the Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary, has emerged as a lead­ing can­di­date to take over from Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>The new Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party pres­i­dent will al­most au­to­mat­i­cally re­place Mr Abe as prime min­is­ter, be­cause the party, along with its ally Komeito, has full con­trol over the Diet.</p>
    <p>Other prom­i­nent can­di­dates for prime min­is­ter in­clude Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Taro Aso, staunch Abe critic Shigeru Ishiba, De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono, En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi and for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida. Some of the can­di­dates come from po­lit­i­cal dy­nas­ties, such as Mr Koizumi and Mr Kono.</p>
    <p>Who­ever takes over as prime min­is­ter will have lit­tle chance to re­di­rect Ja­pan’s eco­nomic path and for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>First of all, he or she will have to deal with the deadly Covid-19. The new leader will also have to main­tain party sta­bil­ity, as sev­eral fac­tions will be wait­ing for the prime min­is­ter to make a blun­der be­fore the elec­tion in Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>On for­eign pol­icy, post-Abe Ja­pan will likely con­tinue to pri­ori­tise its close re­la­tions with the US and prob­a­bly hope US Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Don­ald Trump loses the Novem­ber elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe and Mr Trump have talked dozens of times, and the US Pres­i­dent has per­sis­tently asked Ja­pan to pay more for US mil­i­tary pro­tec­tion and widen its mar­ket for US prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The more assertive China and the hos­tile South Korea also re­main high on Ja­pan’s for­eign pol­icy agenda, as is its men­ac­ing nu­clear neigh­bour North Korea.</p>
    <p>East Asia will sap much of Ja­pan’s en­ergy, be­cause its for­mer colonies in the re­gion have still not for­given Ja­pan for its ruth­less rule dur­ing World War II.</p>
    <p>When it comes to Asean,</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor will con­tinue to treat the re­gional bloc well be­cause it has be­come a long-time key eco­nomic and trade part­ner of Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>As for In­done­sia, Ja­pan is a ma­jor goods and ser­vices ex­port des­ti­na­tion and a top source of di­rect in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko “Jokowi” Wi­dodo ac­knowl­edged in a tweet that un­der Mr Abe’s lead­er­ship, bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries have grown stronger.</p>
    <p>At least for a while, how­ever, Asean, in­clud­ing In­done­sia, can­not ex­pect the new prime min­is­ter to level up the part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the new prime min­is­ter needs to han­dle Asean with care, as the 10-mem­ber</p>
    <p>group­ing can look to China for deals that ben­e­fit all.</p>
    <p>China will work with Abe’s suc­ces­sor</p>
    <p>Wang Haibin China Daily, China</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe an­nounced his res­ig­na­tion from of­fice due to health rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry has wished him a speedy re­cov­ery and praised him for the ef­forts he has made to work with China to get re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries back on track.</p>
    <p>Who­ever suc­ceeds him, China is will­ing to work with the Ja­panese side to deepen anti-epi­demic and eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion, and pro­mote the con­tin­u­ous im­prove­ment and de­vel­op­ment of bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mr Abe took of­fice in 2012, he im­ple­mented “Abe­nomics”, which stressed loose mon­e­tary poli­cies and stim­u­lated the Ja­panese econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Partly as a re­sult of that, Ja­pan’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth rate reached 2 per cent in 2013 and kept that rate for four years.</p>
    <p>Yet in 2018, the rate dropped to 0.79 per cent and fur­ther to</p>
    <p>0.65 per cent last year. It was an­tic­i­pated that the Tokyo Olympic Games that were due to be held this year would be a shot in the arm for the Ja­panese econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Since the out­break of Covid-19, Mr Abe’s Cab­i­net has rolled out an un­prece­dented eco­nomic stim­u­lus pack­age to counter the eco­nomic fall­out, which is be­gin­ning to de­liver re­sults as the econ­omy ap­pears to be on a re­cov­ery track.</p>
    <p>How­ever, most ex­perts be­lieve that the re­cov­ery will be very slow as Ja­pan’s econ­omy lacks mo­men­tum due to weak do­mes­tic and ex­ter­nal de­mand.</p>
    <p>As­sess can­di­dates’ poll pledges, po­lit­i­cal views</p>
    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri Shim­bun, Ja­pan</p>
    <p>With the cam­paign to of­fi­cially elect a suc­ces­sor to Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe start­ing on Tues­day and the vot­ing and bal­lot count­ing on Sept 14, the out­line of the elec­tion is be­com­ing clear, cen­tring on three can­di­dates: Chief</p>
    <p>Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) Pol­icy Re­search Coun­cil chair­man Fu­mio Kishida and for­mer LDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Shigeru Ishiba.</p>
    <p>All three are vet­er­ans who have held im­por­tant posts. It is hoped that they will use their ex­per­tise to ac­tively dis­cuss poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Mr Abe’s long-run­ning ad­min­is­tra­tion, mul­ti­ple cases of the de­struc­tion and sloppy han­dling of records, as well as fal­si­fi­ca­tion of of­fi­cial doc­u­ments, have been dis­cov­ered. It is true that pub­lic dis­trust has spread.</p>
    <p>It is ques­tion­able that Mr Suga has de­scribed all of these is­sues as “hav­ing al­ready been set­tled”.</p>
    <p>Even if he be­comes the new prime min­is­ter, trust in his ad­min­is­tra­tion could be shaken.</p>
    <p>It seems that he will have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to make ef­forts to ex­am­ine and im­prove de­ci­sion-mak­ing and doc­u­ment man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishida an­nounced his poli­cies cen­tring on mea­sures against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>He ex­pressed his in­ten­tion to ex­pand virus test­ing and im­ple­ment eco­nomic stim­u­lus mea­sures flex­i­bly.</p>
    <p>Mr Ishiba fo­cused on poli­cies to elim­i­nate over-con­cen­tra­tion of pop­u­la­tion and govern­ment func­tions in Tokyo and build a safer na­tion, such as by es­tab­lish­ing a dis­as­ter pre­ven­tion min­istry.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Kishida and Mr Ishiba stressed the need to sup­port re­search on ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and de­velop dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stand­able that they are try­ing to make up for the weak­ness of Abe­nomics and re­vi­talise the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Five of the LDP’s seven fac­tions ex­pressed sup­port for Mr Suga. He has the up­per hand in terms of Diet mem­bers’ votes, which ac­count for 75 per cent of the to­tal votes.</p>
    <p>What can­not be over­looked is the fact that fac­tions are al­ready com­pet­ing for lead­er­ship in an at­tempt to jump on the band­wagon.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to de­cide on a new leader based on can­di­dates’ elec­tion pledges and po­lit­i­cal stances.</p>
