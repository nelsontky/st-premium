    <p>ST Face­book users ex­pressed their hurt and con­fu­sion over a pos­si­ble fine for res­i­dents who dis­play the Sin­ga­pore flag be­yond Sept 30, es­pe­cially since it is seen as a ral­ly­ing sym­bol amid the Covid-19 cri­sis. These posts over­shad­owed those of peo­ple ex­plain­ing that the fine helps to safe­guard the dig­nity of the flag.</p>
    <p>A lot of Straits Times Face­book users ex­pressed their hurt and con­fu­sion over a pos­si­ble fine for those who dis­play the Sin­ga­pore flag with­out a flag­pole be­yond</p>
    <p>Sept 30, since it is seen as a pa­tri­otic act and a ral­ly­ing sym­bol amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Michelle Loh said: “I think the warn­ing of a $1,000 fine re­ally leaves a bad taste (in ev­ery­one’s mouth), es­pe­cially after what the Gov­ern­ment has done dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod, re­mind­ing all Sin­ga­pore­ans to keep united, stay safe. It’s re­ally sad. It breaks all the trust we have built ear­lier.”</p>
    <p>Jack Chan said: “Much be­fore our Na­tional Day this year, we were told to put up the flag in sup­port of Covid-19. Then came our Na­tional Day. Now that our Na­tional Day is over, are we no longer talk­ing about sol­i­dar­ity to con­tain the Covid-19 un­til maybe, say, Phase 3?</p>
    <p>“I don’t see con­sis­tency here. Show­ing pa­tri­o­tism should be at one’s will and should not be dic­tated. We should be proud to see more signs of ‘lov­ing Sin­ga­pore’ from our own ci­ti­zens.”</p>
    <p>These posts over­shad­owed those of peo­ple gen­tly ex­plain­ing the pur­pose of the fine is to help safe­guard the dig­nity of the flag.</p>
    <p>DUST AND DIG­NITY</p>
    <p>The rule is not new, as some ST Face­book users pointed out. Josephine Si­mon Do­rai said: “As far as I know, this rul­ing has been around for as long as I re­mem­ber.”</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, the flag can be dis­played out­side a build­ing or in an open space with­out a flag­pole be­tween July 1 and Sept 30. Ear­lier this year, the time­frame was ex­tended to al­low the flag to be put up in such a man­ner from April 25 to Sept 30 as a ral­ly­ing sym­bol amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>After last Wed­nes­day, those who con­tinue to dis­play the flag will risk be­ing fined up to $1,000 un­der the Sin­ga­pore Arms and Flag and Na­tional An­them (Safna) rules.</p>
    <p>When Her­Man GonMez wrote, “Why dis­cour­age such show­ing of af­fec­tion to­wards our own coun­try”, reader Daniel Tan Boon Huat replied: “Her­Man GonMez, it’s go­ing to be faded if you hang too long.”</p>
    <p>It is ac­tu­ally about pro­tect­ing the flag and what it stands for.</p>
    <p>The se­nior di­rec­tor of the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth’s (MCCY) re­silience and en­gage­ment di­vi­sion, Mr Letchu­manan Narayanan, noted in an ST re­port on Sept 27: “One con­sid­er­a­tion for al­low­ing the dis­play of the flag will be whether we can safe­guard the dig­nity of the flag, in­clud­ing how it could be sub­ject to wear and tear re­sult­ing from ex­tended dis­play or ne­glect.”</p>
    <p>ST Face­book reader Ron Wang wrote of the fine: “Okay, at first, I thought it’s kinda stupid. But after read­ing, it’s to pre­vent peo­ple from dam­ag­ing it due to ne­glect­ing. In a way, it’s to pro­tect the im­age of our coun­try flag. Then I think it’s rea­son­able.”</p>
    <p>John Tang said: “I agree with the ‘fine’ rule. The do­mes­tic na­tional flag made of cot­ton ma­te­rial must be kept clean and dig­ni­fied with bright colour. Putting it out at the win­dow for too long would al­low it to gather dust and make it look like a piece of rag hang­ing for sun­shine.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, most of our flags are hung at the para­pet, out of sight and be­ing for­got­ten by the own­ers.”</p>
    <p>NOT FINE WITH IT</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple think gen­tle re­minders are good enough.</p>
    <p>Rachel Rox said: “Just change to a new flag when the ex­ist­ing one looks old. Sim­ple. Why still need to fine ci­ti­zens? What kind of dra­co­nian rul­ing is this and for what, dis­play of pa­tri­o­tism in the very coun­try we are in? Weird.”</p>
    <p>Sandy Ser said: “Can’t they just get the RC peo­ple to walk around and help keep the flag for the res­i­dent or re­mind them to keep? Rather than broad­cast the con­se­quences of not keep­ing the flag. Ev­ery­thing also fine, even show­ing pa­tri­o­tism also kena fine. Sigh.”</p>
    <p>Loh Chee Hwa wrote: “Wah. I used my three ex­tra flags to hang for my neigh­bours. $3,000 fine for show­ing my pa­tri­o­tism if I’m for­get­ful.” And Michelle Ng con­cluded: “Then bet­ter don’t hang for­ever, just in case for­get to re­move and get fine.”</p>
    <p>Well, no one has been fined for dis­play­ing the na­tional flag be­yond the time pe­riod al­lowed un­der the Safna rules, and the au­thor­i­ties do not plan to start do­ing so. This was re­vealed by MCCY Min­is­ter Ed­win Tong in a Face­book post last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“Let me as­sure you: As far as I know, no one has ever been fined for this, nor do we plan to do so,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“There is no rea­son to ‘pun­ish’ those who treat it with re­spect and dig­nity, and are proud to show­case the Sin­ga­pore spirit.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tong also said that his min­istry had ini­ti­ated a re­view of Safna rules be­fore the re­cent re­port about the fine. The amend­ments may al­low for more oc­ca­sions on which the flag can be dis­played, while pro­tect­ing it from ex­tended dis­play or ne­glect.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Pa­tri­o­tism is not just a right, it’s sim­ply right.”</p>
