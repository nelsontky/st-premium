    <p>TEAM EF­FORT</p>
    <p>I’m okay as a man­ager, but they make us a re­ally spe­cial bunch of foot­ball brains and I love to work with them to­gether.</p>

    <p>JUR­GEN KLOPP, shar­ing his award with his coach­ing staff.</p>
    <p>NO HARD FEEL­INGS</p>
    <p>I will for­give you for wak­ing me up in the morn­ing at half-past three to tell me you won the league. Thank you.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>ALEX FER­GU­SON, for­mer Manch­ester United man­ager, con­grat­u­lat­ing Klopp.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • For­mer Manch­ester United man­ager Alex Fer­gu­son said Liver­pool’s Jur­gen Klopp thor­oughly de­served his suc­cess this sea­son and was even will­ing to for­give the lat­ter for wak­ing him up in the early hours of the morn­ing to an­nounce his league tri­umph.</p>
    <p>Klopp was pre­sented with the Alex Fer­gu­son Tro­phy on Mon­day af­ter be­ing named the League Man­agers’ As­so­ci­a­tion (LMA) man­ager of the year for guid­ing the Mersey­side club to their first top-flight ti­tle in 30 years.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle was sealed when Chelsea beat Manch­ester City 2-1 on a Thurs­day night late last month, but Klopp clearly waited a few hours be­fore get­ting in touch with the some­times gruff Scot.</p>
    <p>“I will for­give you for wak­ing me up in the morn­ing at half-past three to tell me you won the league. Thank you,” a jovial Fer­gu­son, a five-time LMA win­ner, said in a con­grat­u­la­tory video. “You re­ally thor­oughly de­served it. The per­for­mance level of your team was fan­tas­tic. Your per­son­al­ity runs right through the whole club. I think it was a mar­vel­lous per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>The Scot, who made good on his pledge to knock Liver­pool off their perch by lead­ing United to 13 ti­tles from 1993 to 2013, en­joys a good re­la­tion­ship with Klopp and once sounded out the German about suc­ceed­ing him at Old Traf­ford.</p>
    <p>For­mer Borus­sia Dort­mund boss Klopp opted to go to An­field in 2015 in­stead and has gone from strength to strength. His team are also the reign­ing Euro­pean and world cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>He told Sky Sports: “I’m ab­so­lutely de­lighted to get this won­der­ful tro­phy, it’s re­ally won­der­ful. I saw who won it be­fore, some re­ally big, big Liver­pool names in­volved, not only Liver­pool names like Bill Shankly I think, Bob Pais­ley, Joe Fa­gan and Kenny (Dal­glish) whose name seems to be all over the tro­phy. Bren­dan (Rodgers) also won it, which was well de­served.”</p>
    <p>Chris Wilder, last year’s win­ner, set­tled for the run­ner-up spot this time af­ter Sh­effield United’s im­pres­sive first sea­son back in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>Klopp also pipped Leeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa and Wy­combe Wan­der­ers man­ager Gareth Ainsworth to the pres­ti­gious award, voted for by their peers, and the 53-year-old cred­ited his coach­ing staff and play­ers.</p>
    <p>“I’m okay as a man­ager, but they make us a re­ally spe­cial bunch of foot­ball brains and I love to work with them to­gether,” he said. “Pep Li­jn­ders, Peter Kraw­i­etz, John Achter­berg, Vi­tor Matos and Jack Robin­son – it’s a plea­sure. I could carry on with the list be­cause we have so many great peo­ple here who make it hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“To my play­ers, I take this and I love it for all of us.”</p>
