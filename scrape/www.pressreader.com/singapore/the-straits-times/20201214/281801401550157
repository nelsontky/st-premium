    <p>The laid-back Cen­tral Java city of Solo was lit up with cheer af­ter un­of­fi­cial tal­lies showed the son of In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo would likely be­come its mayor.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­bran Rak­abum­ing Raka, 33, is set to as­sume the post, like his fa­ther once did, af­ter he trounced a tailor in the Dec 9 re­gional elec­tions, win­ning more than 85 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>“Good, now Jokowi can teach Gi­bran how to im­prove Solo while they chit-chat dur­ing din­ner. No need for for­mal­i­ties,” hawker Tri Hartono, 56, told The Straits Times, us­ing the Pres­i­dent’s nick­name.</p>
    <p>“Jokowi was once Solo mayor, and a fan­tas­tic one. He made Solo fa­mous when he be­came pres­i­dent. Now his son has made Solo proud too,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko rose from hum­ble beginnings as a fur­ni­ture maker to be­come the city mayor from 2005 to 2012. He was elected Jakarta gov­er­nor in 2012, and In­done­sia’s pres­i­dent in 2014.</p>
    <p>Also known as Su­rakarta, the royal city of 600,000 peo­ple was the cen­tre of power in Cen­tral Java dur­ing the Mataram King­dom be­tween the 16th and 18th cen­turies. It is a cul­tural hub known for its wayang pup­petry and hand­crafted batik. Through it flows Java’s long­est river, the Ben­gawan Solo.</p>
    <p>Solo’s econ­omy is largely driven by trade in agri­cul­tural and in­dus­trial prod­ucts as well as tourism, with the Ker­a­ton royal palace, tex­tile mar­kets and hand­i­craft cen­tres among its main at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents have at­trib­uted Solo’s trans­for­ma­tion into a mod­ern city to Mr Joko. Dur­ing his stint as</p>
    <p>mayor, he had cut red tape, im­proved trans­port ser­vices and or­gan­ised mass cul­tural events like the Solo Batik Car­ni­val, draw­ing lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors alike.</p>
    <p>To­day, Mr Joko re­mains highly re­spected in Solo, and he and his fam­ily con­tinue to win pub­lic adu­la­tion for their hu­mil­ity, sim­plic­ity and hon­esty, res­i­dents told ST.</p>
    <p>So it is not sur­pris­ing that Mr Gi­bran has re­ceived over­whelm­ing sup­port to lead Solo. But he has big shoes to fill, as Solo res­i­dents have a long list of wishes.</p>
    <p>For Mr Tri Hartono, these in­clude in­stalling more street lamps and hav­ing cy­cling lanes.</p>
    <p>“Jokowi had turned messy shrubs into parks, built pave­ments and or­gan­ised tra­di­tional mar­kets into proper sec­tions for dry goods, meat and tex­tiles. We ex­pect noth­ing less from Gi­bran,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Is Hariyanto, 47, who runs a laun­dry busi­ness, is bank­ing on the gen­er­a­tion of In­ter­net-savvy mil­len­ni­als to or­gan­ise more tech­nol­ogy work­shops for busi­ness­men like him.</p>
    <p>Fiercely pas­sion­ate about their cul­ture and her­itage, Solo res­i­dents hope for a leader who is able to go global with­out sac­ri­fic­ing lo­cal cus­toms and tra­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Al­pha Fe­bela Priy­at­mono, 60, a univer­sity lec­turer in ur­ban de­sign as well as a batik busi­ness­man, hopes the govern­ment will en­cour­age batik crafts­men to use nat­u­ral dyes and pro­duc­tion cen­tres to dis­pose of chem­i­cal waste more re­spon­si­bly so that there is no pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“We hope that Solo can be­come the cap­i­tal of eco-friendly batik in In­done­sia,” he said.</p>
    <p>He hopes the Ben­gawan Solo river, a non­de­script chan­nel of brown wa­ter, will be­come the “face of Solo” and an im­por­tant land­mark such as the Sin­ga­pore River. He has sug­gested pack­ing the river­side area with batik ar­ti­sans, food ven­dors and wa­ter ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For Solo mil­len­ni­als, the idea of a young per­son lead­ing the city brings hopes for a bet­ter fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ms Lau­ren­sia Liona, 27, a Chi­nese Catholic, noted that a leader who is open-minded and colour­blind would also give a greater sense of se­cu­rity to eth­nic mi­nori­ties like her. She added: “As the Pres­i­dent’s son, he may be able to get the govern­ment to pay more at­ten­tion to is­sues such as racial in­tol­er­ance and con­flicts.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter liv­ing abroad for nine years – in Malaysia, Canada and Qatar – Ms Lau­ren­sia re­turned home in 2018 to take over her fam­ily’s sixth-gen­er­a­tion bak­ery called Ganep, fa­mous for its “roti ke­cik” (or small bread) snacks. And also to give back to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>She said: “I’m very proud of Jokowi. Solo peo­ple re­ally saw and felt the changes he made.</p>
    <p>“His whole fam­ily is very hum­ble. Mr Gi­bran is also not snob­bish and he has many great ideas for Solo.”</p>
