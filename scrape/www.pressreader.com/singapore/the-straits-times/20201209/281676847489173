    <p>More peo­ple will be able to at­tend con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices, as some re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions have in­creased their ca­pac­ity limit to 250 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>At least four churches The Straits Times con­tacted are wel­com­ing be­tween 150 and 250 wor­ship­pers, up from the cur­rent limit of 100.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) also said that five lo­cal mosques will al­low 250 wor­ship­pers each for ev­ery Fri­day prayer ses­sion from this week.</p>
    <p>This means that each mosque can serve 750 wor­ship­pers across three ses­sions ev­ery Fri­day – at 12.50pm, 1.50pm and 2.50pm.</p>
    <p>All of these re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions are part of a pi­lot spear­headed by the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) that is aimed at al­low­ing re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties to grad­u­ally re­sume with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot pro­gramme, which opened to re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions for ap­pli­ca­tion on Oct 3, re­quires those on board to have steadily con­ducted wor­ship ser­vices for 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In line with the MCCY’s re­quire­ments, peo­ple al­lowed at wor­ship ser­vices must abide by zon­ing re­quire­ments. Each zone can have up to 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Church of the Holy Spirit in Thom­son said that since Nov 21, up to 250 wor­ship­pers have been al­lowed for its five wor­ship ses­sions held ev­ery week­end.</p>
    <p>Heart of God Church in Eunos, which has eight week­end ser­vices, has also been hold­ing ser­vices with the new limit of 250 peo­ple since Nov 14.</p>
    <p>The five par­tic­i­pat­ing mosques are Al-Is­lah in Pung­gol, Al-Istigh­far in Pasir Ris, Darul Ghufran in Tampines, Assyafaah in Ad­mi­ralty and Al-Khair in Teck Whye.</p>
    <p>“The five mosques were cho­sen based on their abil­ity and readi­ness to com­ply with all re­quire­ments of the safe man­age­ment mea­sures as pre­scribed for places of wor­ship,” a Muis spokesman said in re­sponse to ST’s queries.</p>
    <p>Those who have been un­able to ob­tain a prayer slot since Nov 20 can now reg­is­ter for one by us­ing the Mus­limSg app or vis­it­ing this web­site: https://our­mosques .com­mon­spaces.sg/</p>
    <p>Same-day book­ing for any prayer slots that re­main will also be avail­able ev­ery Fri­day from 10am to 2pm.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, two other churches – Toa Payoh Methodist Church and Amaz­ing Grace Pres­by­te­rian Church – be­gan wel­com­ing 200 and 150 par­tic­i­pants re­spec­tively for each ser­vice.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed for each wor­ship ses­sion de­pends partly on the size of the place of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the MCCY said in a state­ment that for places of wor­ship with struc­tured wor­ship ser­vices, there must be sep­a­rate en­trances and ex­its or stag­gered en­try and exit times for each zone.</p>
    <p>This is to avoid in­ter­ac­tion be­tween wor­ship­pers across zones.</p>
    <p>Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery said that from Dec 21, it will be part of the MCCY pi­lot. It is cur­rently limited to hav­ing 100 devo­tees at one time.</p>
    <p>Sri Mari­amman Tem­ple in South Bridge Road is also par­tic­i­pat­ing in the MCCY pi­lot, while Taoist Fed­er­a­tion chair­man Tan Thiam Lye said that it is “in­ter­ested” in ap­ply­ing for ap­proval.</p>
