    <p>So about a week ago, I left my per­fectly good home and checked into a ho­tel about 30 min­utes by MRT from where I live.</p>
    <p>When I say my home is “per­fectly good”, it comes with caveats. There is a small lizard prob­lem (not be­cause of their num­ber, but be­cause they fall into the open mouths of sleep­ers, which means one lizard is too many lizards).</p>
    <p>Among t he non-lizard is­sues af­fect­ing my res­i­dence is that like many of us, I have been stuck there for roughly 30,000 years, or since Fe­bru­ary. When this as­sign­ment came up, I jumped at the chance to whis­per to my ceil­ing-walk­ing buddy: “You may end up in my mouth one night, but it will not be tonight.”</p>
    <p>My ho­tel, lyf Fu­nan in Fu­nan mall, bills it­self as a “new co-liv­ing con­cept for a global com­mu­nity of thought lead­ers”, one that gath­ers “the best peo­ple and ideas shap­ing our gen­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Which is an un­canny co­in­ci­dence, be­cause my LinkedIn pro­file is the pre­cise op­po­site of that. Still, the kind folks at lyf let me have what they call a One Of A Kind Plus stu­dio. It comes with the nor­mal room ameni­ties – queen bed, bath­room and tele­vi­sion, but also a kitchen with sink, cooker, pots, pans and cut­lery.</p>
    <p>But why cook when (a) be­ing a guest comes with dis­counts at mall eater­ies (b) it would break the in­do­lence re­quired of a stay­ca­tion. Look, I didn’t write the rules.</p>
    <p>So you can treat your­self at a nor­mal lux­ury ho­tel to wel­come fruit bowls, a jacuzzi within arm’s reach and a mas­sage ther­a­pist camped un­der your bed, but at lyf, you get to push the lim­its and dis­cover new facets to your per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>There is the em­pha­sis on com­mu­nity, for ex­am­ple. There is a com­mu­nal kitchen and lounge. The am­bi­ence of the lounge, with young men and women in T-shirts and shorts hun­kered over lap­tops, re­minded me of a univer­sity res­i­dence – although a much more lux­u­ri­ous ver­sion – and made me feel nos­tal­gic. This would be a great place for cou­ples who want to rekin­dle the magic of their first meeting, when they spied each other across bowls of in­stant ra­men at the res­i­dence kitchen and thought: “I should ask this per­son to join my econs study group.”</p>
    <p>There are many more high-tech and self-ser­vice op­tions here – a phone app opens doors, does the check-in and lets you mes­sage the front desk, for ex­am­ple. My room has a tele­vi­sion, but con­tent needs to be cast to it from the guest’s de­vice. It is a po­lar­is­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, but you have to ad­mire the ho­tel’s com­mit­ment to its tar­get au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>But we are not here to gawp at Net­flix and fid­dle with phones. We are in the heart of the his­toric down­town. Un­able to sleep, I step out at 3am to walk around Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. The Sin­ga­pore River is like glass and the rows of empty bars are some­thing close to beau­ti­ful.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at the stairs head­ing up into the gloom of Fort Can­ning Park, I con­sider a hike un­der the brood­ing trees for about two sec­onds be­fore think­ing bet­ter of it and head­ing back for a shower and sleep. You can get me next time, se­rial killers!</p>
    <p>The wa­ter is hot and the pres­sure is strong. It feels great and turns on with a nor­mal tap han­dle in­stead of an app. It is prob­a­bly an over­sight. Maybe the ho­tel will fix it in the next up­grade.</p>
    <p>• HOT TIP: Bring a good cam­era for night-time pho­tographs. Wan­der around the Civic Dis­trict and take shots of de­serted spots at night.</p>
