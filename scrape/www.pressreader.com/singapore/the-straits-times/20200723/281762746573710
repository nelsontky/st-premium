    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Sci­en­tists have known for sev­eral months that the coro­n­avirus can be­come sus­pended i n mi­cro-droplets ex­pelled by pa­tients when they speak and breathe, but un­til now there was no proof that th­ese tiny par­ti­cles are in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>A new study by sci­en­tists at the Univer­sity of Ne­braska that was up­loaded to a med­i­cal pre-print site this week has shown for the first time that Sars-CoV-2 taken from mi­cro-droplets, de­fined as un­der five mi­crons, can repli­cate in lab con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>This boosts the hy­poth­e­sis that nor­mal speak­ing and breath­ing, not just cough­ing and sneez­ing, are re­spon­si­ble for spread­ing the virus caus­ing Covid-19 – and that in­fec­tious doses of the virus can travel dis­tances far greater than the 2m urged by so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The re­sults are still con­sid­ered pre­lim­i­nary and have not yet ap­peared in a peer-re­viewed jour­nal, which would lend more cred­i­bil­ity to the sci­en­tists’ meth­ods. The pa­per was posted to the medrxiv.org web­site, where most cut­ting-edge re­search dur­ing the pan­demic has first been made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The same team wrote a pa­per in March show­ing the virus re­mains air­borne in the rooms of hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients, and this study will soon be pub­lished in a jour­nal, said the lead au­thor.</p>
    <p>“It is ac­tu­ally fairly dif­fi­cult” to col­lect the sam­ples, Dr Joshua San­tarpia, as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor at Univer­sity of Ne­braska Med­i­cal Cen­tre, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The team used a de­vice the size of a cell­phone for the pur­pose, but “the con­cen­tra­tions are typ­i­cally very low, your chances of re­cov­er­ing ma­te­rial are small”.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists took air sam­ples from five rooms of bedrid­den pa­tients, at a height of about 30cm over the foot of their beds.</p>
    <p>The pa­tients were talk­ing, which pro­duces mi­cro-droplets that be­come sus­pended in the air for sev­eral hours in what is re­ferred to as an “aerosol”, and some were cough­ing. The team man­aged to col­lect mi­cro-droplets as small as one mi­cron in di­am­e­ter. They then placed th­ese sam­ples into a cul­ture to make them grow, find­ing that three of the 18 sam­ples tested were able to repli­cate.</p>
    <p>For Dr San­tarpia, this rep­re­sents proof that mi­cro-droplets, which also travel much greater dis­tances than big droplets, are ca­pa­ble of in­fect­ing peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial for mi­cro-droplet trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus was at one stage thought to be im­prob­a­ble. Later, sci­en­tists be­gan to change their minds and ac­knowl­edge it may be a pos­si­bil­ity, which is the ra­tionale for uni­ver­sal mask­ing. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion was among the last to shift its po­si­tion, do­ing so on July 7.</p>
    <p>“I feel like the de­bate has be­come more po­lit­i­cal than sci­en­tific,” said Dr San­tarpia. “I think most sci­en­tists that work on in­fec­tious dis­eases agree that there’s likely an air­borne com­po­nent, though we may quib­ble over how large.”</p>
