    <p>I am a par­ent to two teenagers, a 17-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, which is why the ar­ti­cle on the poll by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) and Black­box Re­search piqued my in­ter­est (49% of par­ents able to talk to kids about sex: Poll, July 3).</p>
    <p>Given that more than half of par­ents are un­com­fort­able talk­ing to their chil­dren about sex, it is im­per­a­tive that sex ed­u­ca­tion in schools fills in the gaps. After all, par­ents have to trust that their chil­dren will make the right de­ci­sions when the par­ents are not around.</p>
    <p>We can try to guide the chil­dren ac­cord­ingly, but not with­out an ef­fec­tive part­ner­ship with schools on sex ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that sex ed­u­ca­tion in school should go be­yond top­ics like ab­sti­nence, the use of con­tra­cep­tion and any pos­si­ble reper­cus­sions of sex, to in­clude a syl­labus on con­sent.</p>
    <p>From con­ver­sa­tions with my chil­dren and their friends, and a re­cent sur­vey re­leased by Aware, it would ap­pear that many young peo­ple do not have a strong un­der­stand­ing of con­sent. Many teens I’ve spo­ken to do not re­mem­ber ever dis­cussing con­sent in school, and are un­sure how it ap­plies in real life.</p>
    <p>This wor­ries me as it re­lates to the phys­i­cal and emo­tional well-be­ing of our youth. Some prob­a­bly ex­pect that go­ing on dates, es­pe­cially with some­one who pays for their meals and movies, is akin to agree­ing to sex and that get­ting con­sent does not need to be a con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>They may be con­cerned that they would ap­pear un­cool if they stopped to check for con­sent. Oth­ers may even be­lieve it to be ro­man­tic to keep “chas­ing”, even after the other party has in­di­cated no in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple need to learn that any­thing less than an en­thu­si­as­tic, in­formed “yes” should give them pause. No­body is ever en­ti­tled to in­ti­macy or af­fec­tion from an­other per­son.</p>
    <p>We need to teach our chil­dren these lessons.</p>
