    <p>1906: Born in Oc­to­ber to wealthy arts and an­tiques dealer Zhang Jin­jiang and his wife. Chen, the fourth of 12 chil­dren, has a priv­i­leged up­bring­ing. Her father, who sup­ported Dr Sun Yat Sen’s rev­o­lu­tion­ary ef­forts, funds her art stud­ies at the Art Stu­dents League of New York be­tween 1926 and 1927 and the Academie Co­larossi and Academie Biloul in Paris.</p>
    <p>1930: A mo­men­tous year for Chen, who mar­ries Eu­gene Chen Youren, the Chi­nese for­eign min­is­ter known for his fierce anti-im­pe­ri­al­ist stance. Two of her paint­ings are also ac­cepted by the Sa­lon d’Au­tomne ex­hi­bi­tion in Paris. She is the only Asian woman thus honoured.</p>
    <p>1930 to 1937: The cou­ple re­lo­cate from Shang­hai to Europe and back again to Hong Kong as the po­lit­i­cal winds shift in China. In Hong Kong, Eu­gene Chen be­comes in­volved in anti-Ja­panese ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>1944: The cou­ple are in­ter­ro­gated by the Ja­panese and placed un­der house ar­rest. Eu­gene Chen dies in May. Chen spends the next few years trav­el­ling through Asia, although she re­mains based in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>1947: Chen re­mar­ries. Ho Yung Chi was Eu­gene Chen’s aide and worked as a jour­nal­ist in New York. Chen moves to New York to join him.</p>
    <p>1949: Chen ex­hibits at the Asia In­sti­tute in New York and the cou­ple move to Paris, where Chen ex­hibits at the Sa­lon d’Au­tomne and the Ga­lerie La Li­corne.</p>
    <p>1951: The cou­ple move to Pe­nang, where Chen teaches art at a Chi­nese high school.</p>
    <p>1953: Chen re­lo­cates to Sin­ga­pore af­ter her di­vorce from Ho and takes up a teach­ing post at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts at the in­vi­ta­tion of founder and prin­ci­pal Lim Hak Tai. She has al­ready been a fre­quent vis­i­tor to Sin­ga­pore and has many artist friends. She be­comes the sole fe­male in the co­terie who pi­o­neers the Nanyang style of paint­ing.</p>
    <p>1982: Chen re­ceives the Cul­tural Medal­lion for her con­tri­bu­tions to Sin­ga­pore’s arts scene.</p>
    <p>1993: She dies on March 15 at Mount Alver­nia Hos­pi­tal af­ter a long bat­tle with rheuma­toid arthri­tis.</p>
