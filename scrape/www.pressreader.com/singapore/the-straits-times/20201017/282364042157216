    <p>•</p>
    <p>Tough Covid-19 re­stric­tions have cast a pre-win­ter gloom across Mersey­side, but at least Ever­ton sup­port­ers have some­thing to lift their spir­its af­ter their side’s storm­ing start to the Pre­mier League sea­son.</p>
    <p>To­day, Carlo Ancelotti’s table­top­pers host cham­pi­ons Liver­pool at Good­i­son Park flushed with a rare sense of su­pe­ri­or­ity over their Mersey ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton boast the only 100 per cent record in the Pre­mier League of teams who have played four games, are av­er­ag­ing three goals per game, and in Do­minic CalvertLew­in have the divi­sion’s j ointlead­ing scorer along­side Tot­ten­ham’s Son He­ung-min.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, Liver­pool went into the in­ter­na­tional break lick­ing their wounds af­ter a 7-2 de­feat by As­ton Villa and af­ter four games have the joint sec­ond-worst de­fen­sive record in the top flight. Manch­ester United and bot­tom side Ful­ham have also con­ceded 11 league goals – only West Bromwich Al­bion have let in more (13).</p>
    <p>It is far too early to be talk­ing about a shift of power from the red to the blue half of Mersey­side, but</p>
    <p>Ever­ton’s in­vig­o­rat­ing foot­ball so far and Liver­pool’s fragility have cer­tainly height­ened in­ter­est in to­day’s clash out­side of the city.</p>
    <p>Calvert-Lewin has been grab­bing the head­lines with his six league goals so far but it is Ever­ton’s new sign­ings who have trans­formed Ancelotti’s side from the ster­ile un­der­achiev­ers they were last sea­son into po­ten­tial top-four can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Colom­bian play­maker James Ro­driguez has been a rev­e­la­tion so far in an at­tack­ing trio along­side Calvert-Lewin and Richarli­son, while the in­dus­try of Brazil­ian Allan and the power of Ab­doulaye Doucoure have turned Ever­ton’s mid­field into a for­mi­da­ble unit.</p>
    <p>With back-up op­tions such as new cen­tral de­fen­sive sign­ing Ben God­frey, Alex Iwobi, Bernard and Tom Davies, Ever­ton’s form does not look like be­ing a flash in the pan.</p>
    <p>They have won seven out of seven in all com­pe­ti­tions so far but to­day’s derby will be the ul­ti­mate lit­mus test as the Tof­fees, with­out a ma­jor tro­phy since the 1995 FA Cup, seek a first league win over Liver­pool for 10 years.</p>
    <p>Ancelotti, though, has urged cau­tion against the Reds.</p>
    <p>He said at his pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day: “Liver­pool as usual play with a lot of in­ten­sity and qual­ity. This will be the op­po­nent we play to­mor­row, so we have to pay at­ten­tion. But we have to be con­fi­dent to be able to show our qual­ity.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one knows how im­por­tant this derby is. Ev­ery­one knows how im­por­tant this game is for this pe­riod, we want to keep this pe­riod good for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“It will be good for us to have this kind of test. One of the best teams in Eng­land for sure, they were the best last sea­son. It’s a fan­tas­tic chal­lenge, a good test for us.”</p>
    <p>He added that all his play­ers would be avail­able to­day. Mean­while, Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp has praised the Ital­ian for the good work he has done since he ar­rived at Ever­ton in December.</p>
    <p>“Carlo is a sen­sa­tional man­ager. It was clear if he has time to build some­thing and re­sources to build some­thing, that is what he will do,” the Ger­man said dur­ing his press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day. “The team look re­ally, re­ally good. You don’t need to be a man­ager to see they have done good busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Of course, it is a proper chal­lenger. We have to be ready to­mor­row and we can show that.”</p>
    <p>Naby Keita will be ab­sent for the trip to­day while Klopp also con­firmed that Sa­dio Mane and Thi­ago Al­can­tara, both re­turn­ing from their coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, “look re­ally good and the boys are ready”.</p>
