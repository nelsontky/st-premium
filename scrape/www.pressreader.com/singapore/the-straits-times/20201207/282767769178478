    <p>LONDON • Gan­dalf, Bilbo Bag­gins and other lu­mi­nar­ies have backed a new crowd-fund­ing fel­low­ship to raise US$6 mil­lion (S$8 mil­lion) to buy the Ox­ford home of The Lord Of The Rings au­thor J.R.R. Tolkien.</p>
    <p>Ac­tors Ian McKellen and Martin Free­man, stars of Peter Jack­son’s Os­car-win­ning film adap­ta­tions, have joined the Pro­ject North­moor cam­paign to turn the sprawl­ing house into a mu­seum in hon­our of the fantasy writer.</p>
    <p>“To raise $6 mil­lion in three months is a huge chal­lenge,” Bri­tish nov­el­ist Ju­lia Gold­ing, who is lead­ing the cam­paign, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, we need only to look at Frodo and Sam’s jour­ney from Riven­dell to Mount Doom – which took that same amount of time – and we are in­spired that we can do this too.”</p>
    <p>With seven bed­rooms and a spa­cious gar­den, 20 North­moor Road in Ox­ford is a far cry from the mod­est hob­bit dwelling at Bag End in­hab­ited by the Bag­gins clan.</p>
    <p>Tolkien and his fam­ily moved into the house in 1930 and lived there for 17 years while he was pro­fes­sor of An­glo-Saxon at Ox­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He wrote The Hob­bit and the bulk of The Lord Of The Rings tril­ogy there.</p>
    <p>De­spite his global fame, there is cur­rently no lit­er­ary cen­tre de­voted to Tolkien in Bri­tain or else­where.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign aims to buy the house from its current owner, ren­o­vate it and cre­ate a mu­seum.</p>
    <p>“We can­not achieve this with­out the sup­port of the world­wide com­mu­nity of Tolkien fans, our fel­low­ship of fun­ders,” McKellen said, ap­peal­ing for do­na­tions at www.pro­ject­north­moor.org un­til March 15 next year.</p>
