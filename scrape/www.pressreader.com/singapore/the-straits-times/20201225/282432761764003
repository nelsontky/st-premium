    <p>WELLING­TON • Con­tro­ver­sial Chi­nese swim­ming star Sun Yang has had his eight-year ban for dop­ing vi­o­la­tions sud­denly over­turned on Wed­nes­day by Switzer­land’s fed­eral court, the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada) said in a state­ment late on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He was banned for eight years by the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS) in Fe­bru­ary, af­ter it ac­cepted an ap­peal from Wada against a de­ci­sion by swim­ming body Fina to clear him of wrong­do­ing for his con­duct dur­ing a 2018 test.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old ap­pealed against that de­ci­sion and Wada said in Wed­nes­day’s state­ment it had been in­formed the Swiss Fed­eral Tri­bunal had up­held a chal­lenge against the chair of the CAS panel but had not made any com­ment on the sub­stance of the case.</p>
    <p>“Wada will take steps to present its case ro­bustly again when the mat­ter re­turns to the CAS panel, which will be chaired by a dif­fer­ent pres­i­dent,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The New York Times re­ported Sun’s lawyers had suc­cess­fully ar­gued to the tri­bunal that the head of the three-man CAS panel, former Ital­ian for­eign min­is­ter Franco Frat­tini, had made com­ments that ex­pressed anti-Chi­nese sen­ti­ments on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>News re­ports ear­lier this year high­lighted Twit­ter posts from the 63-year-old politi­cian’s ac­count ex­press­ing dis­dain over ex­am­ples of an­i­mal cru­elty in China. At least one post in­cluded a term that is con­sid­ered an anti-Chi­nese slur.</p>
    <p>Both Frat­tini and the tri­bunal could not be reached on Wed­nes­day for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing was a rare en­croach­ment on the CAS and it means that Sun, whose com­pet­i­tive ca­reer was ef­fec­tively ended by the dop­ing ban, is free to re­sume swim­ming at least un­til his case is heard by a dif­fer­ent panel at the sports court.</p>
    <p>Sun, the reign­ing world and Olympic cham­pion in 200m freestyle, was banned af­ter he and mem­bers of his en­tourage were found to have smashed vials con­tain­ing blood sam­ples taken at an out-of-com­pe­ti­tion test in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>He has ques­tioned the cre­den­tials and iden­tity of the testers and has con­stantly pro­claimed his in­no­cence.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese, who won two gold medals at the 2012 Lon­don Games and another at Rio de Janeiro in 2016, is a con­tro­ver­sial fig­ure in the sport.</p>
    <p>He served a three-month dop­ing sus­pen­sion in 2014 for tak­ing the stim­u­lant trimetazi­dine, which he said he took to treat a heart con­di­tion, while Aus­tralian swim­mer Mack Hor­ton openly called him a drug cheat at the Rio Games.</p>
    <p>Hor­ton re­fused to share the 400m freestyle podium af­ter com­ing se­cond to Sun at last year’s world cham­pi­onships in South Korea, a move that was ap­plauded by other swim­mers but con­demned by world gov­ern­ing body Fina.</p>
    <p>Swim­ming Aus­tralia said it and Hor­ton had no com­ment on the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial re­ac­tion in China was muted early yes­ter­day, al­though the news man­aged to get into the top-20 trending top­ics on China’s Weibo, a Twit­ter-like so­cial me­dia plat­form. Most users sup­ported the Swiss court’s de­ci­sion to re­fer his case back to the CAS, al­though many held out lit­tle hope of a re­ver­sal of the orig­i­nal re­sult.</p>
    <p>“The over­turn of the case is due to pro­ce­dural vi­o­la­tions, not be­cause of fac­tual flaws,” one user wrote. “The case will be heard by the CAS once more, it is un­likely to re­verse the re­sult.”</p>
