    <p>The is­sue of Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional re­serves sparked a back-and-forth between Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh, re­ply­ing to PM Lee’s crit­i­cism, said that when the Work­ers’ Party (WP) raised the is­sue, its in­tent was not to raid the na­tional cof­fers that have been built up over the years by past gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Rather, its in­ten­tion was to ex­am­ine the ex­tent to which the growth rate of the re­serves can be slowed to help fund so­cial needs, with­out touch­ing the prin­ci­pal amount, he said.</p>
    <p>He also ex­plained the back­drop against which some of the WP’s pro­pos­als were made.</p>
    <p>“Health­care, age­ing, the same Sin­ga­pore­ans who toiled hard now are in their re­tire­ment years (and) have some dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>“Ques­tions of in­ter-gen­er­a­tional eq­uity come up. And that’s the con­text through which some of these pro­pos­als are put for­ward,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, had crit­i­cised how the op­po­si­tion – namely, the WP – had asked for the size of Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves.</p>
    <p>It had pre­vi­ously also with­held sup­port for an in­crease in the goods and ser­vices tax (GST) from 7 per cent to 9 per cent, cit­ing a lack of clar­ity on pro­jected ex­pen­di­ture and al­ter­na­tive rev­enue sources.</p>
    <p>“(They are say­ing), show me how much we have in our re­serves be­fore I de­cide whether to sup­port your Bud­get and tax plans...Ba­si­cally, they are ask­ing: I have some­thing in the bank al­ready. How much of it can I touch?” he said.</p>
    <p>This at­ti­tude is “fun­da­men­tally the wrong ap­proach”, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said there is “noth­ing un­usual” about the WP’s pro­posal to slow the growth rate of the re­serves but leave the prin­ci­pal sum un­touched.</p>
    <p>In fact, the rul­ing party’s MPs had also sup­ported such a move in 2016, when they, along with WP MPs, agreed to add rev­enue con­tri­bu­tions from Te­masek Hold­ings to the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns Con­tri­bu­tion (NIRC) frame­work, he added.</p>
    <p>Un­der the NIRC frame­work, the Gov­ern­ment can spend half of the long-term in­vest­ment re­turns gen­er­ated by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, Te­masek and GIC – the three en­ti­ties tasked to in­vest the re­serves.</p>
    <p>“Does that not re­duce the growth of the re­serves? It does. So the ar­gu­ment can­not be that when the op­po­si­tion tries to put that pro­posal for­ward, some­how we are en­gag­ing in some sort of chi­canery to steal what pre­vi­ous gen­er­a­tions have toiled... over to bring us here,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh noted that Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat had said the size of the re­serves is a mat­ter of na­tional se­cu­rity and can­not be dis­closed.</p>
    <p>But he ar­gued that Par­lia­ment pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity for such fig­ures to be given – if not at a sit­ting, then in a com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Mech­a­nisms are in place, such as the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act and rules on par­lia­men­tary priv­i­lege, that pre­vent an MP from di­vulging the num­bers to oth­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>The WP is ask­ing about these fig­ures “pre­cisely be­cause we’re look­ing for al­ter­na­tives to bet­ter con­sider the wel­fare of Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, PM Lee said he was not ar­gu­ing on the “tech­ni­cal­i­ties of per­cent­ages, draw­downs, NIRC and so on”. Rather, he was ar­gu­ing on a ba­sic prin­ci­ple that re­serves should be seen as a rainy day fund.</p>
    <p>In com­ing up with the NIRC frame­work, PM Lee ac­knowl­edged it al­lows the Gov­ern­ment to draw from the re­serves to fund a cer­tain amount of ex­penses.</p>
    <p>MPs de­bated and agreed on a rule which they felt was “a fair dis­tri­bu­tion between our present and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions”. That rule should not be re­vis­ited as soon as money is re­quired, he added.</p>
    <p>Also, the re­serves could dip for var­i­ous rea­sons, such as when the mar­ket drops and re­duces the value of in­vest­ments de­spite Sin­ga­pore’s best man­age­ment of GIC or Te­masek, as has hap­pened from time to time, and when Sin­ga­pore needs to draw down on the re­serves, as it did this year to cope with the pan­demic, he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee added: “There is a bal­ance of risk which we have to ac­cept. And then there is a fun­da­men­tal mind­set: What are you de­pend­ing on for the fu­ture? What is for now?</p>
    <p>“I sug­gest that our mind­set should be: What I have planned for the fu­ture, I think of as only touch­ing them in ex­tremis.”</p>
