    <p>The chances of the Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon (SCSM) tak­ing place this year in its tra­di­tional for­mat look in­creas­ingly un­likely, as mass par­tic­i­pa­tion sports events con­tinue to be can­celled or turned into vir­tual af­fairs while the world grap­ples with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on the world’s marathon cal­en­dar, with the Bos­ton, New York City, Ber­lin, and most re­cently Chicago events – all part of the pres­ti­gious World Marathon Ma­jors se­ries – called off.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, or­gan­is­ers of the OCBC Cy­cle – Sin­ga­pore’s premier cy­cling event which typ­i­cally at­tracts close to 7,000 par­tic­i­pants – an­nounced the can­cel­la­tion of this year’s edi­tion, and in­tro­duced a free vir­tual ride in its place.</p>
    <p>And yesterday, Sport Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Lim Teck Yin in­di­cated that the SCSM could also fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a Zoom dia­logue ses­sion or­gan­ised by the Em­bassy of Spain and Span­ish-Sin­ga­porean Cham­ber of Com­merce, which dis­cussed the trans­for­ma­tion of the sports in­dus­try be­cause of Covid-19, Lim said that “in­no­vat­ing… (and) rein­vent­ing events as we un­der­stand them” was key.</p>
    <p>He added: “As an ex­am­ple, we have been dis­cussing with Iron­man, which runs the SCSM, as to what we will do this year when it is quite in­con­ceiv­able that we want to bring 50,000 peo­ple to­gether at one lo­ca­tion at one evening or morn­ing to run a race.</p>
    <p>“And it is now about an en­gage­ment over a few months…. vir­tual en­gage­ments and work­shops on run­ning, health, well-be­ing, (and) ac­com­pa­ny­ing that with of­fers of mer­chan­dise and then hav­ing a vir­tual com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“Whether part of the com­pe­ti­tion is in­doors and run­ning on tread­mills, or whether part of that com­pe­ti­tion is dur­ing com­pe­ti­tion week where peo­ple track their dis­tances where they go out­door and run with pac­ers or on their own… the idea is that a sin­gle-day marathon is now split into sev­eral months, with dif­fer­ent phases of en­gage­ments and with dif­fer­ent types of ac­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>Lim also said that the or­gan­is­ers of in­ter­na­tional events are “at the mercy of in­ter­na­tional travel policy” but added that he hopes Sin­ga­pore will start to wel­come such events back “by next year”.</p>
    <p>The SCSM, which is the na­tion’s largest mass par­tic­i­pa­tion sports event, is typ­i­cally launched be­tween March and May. Last year, the event at­tracted over 50,000 par­tic­i­pants, with more than 70,000 supporters lin­ing the route at des­ig­nated spectator zones.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, a spokesman for Iron­man Asia told The Straits Times that the health and well-be</p>
    <p>We have been dis­cussing... what we will do this year when it is quite in­con­ceiv­able that we want to bring 50,000 peo­ple to­gether at one lo­ca­tion at one</p>
    <p>’’ evening or morn­ing to run a race.</p>
    <p>LIM TECK YIN, Sport Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>ing of its “com­mu­nity, run­ners and supporters is of ut­most im­por­tance” and added that it is work­ing closely with gov­ern­ment agen­cies to con­sider the best way for­ward for this year’s SCSM.</p>
    <p>“Our de­ci­sion will be guided by the pre­vail­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures in Sin­ga­pore,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>He also said that ad­di­tional in­for­ma­tion would be shared with run­ners and part­ners and made avail­able on the event’s dig­i­tal plat­forms “in due course”.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, ma­jor sport­ing events that have been can­celled in­clude golf’s HSBC Women’s World</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­onship (Fe­bru­ary), the Sun­down Marathon (May), foot­ball’s In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup (July), For­mula One’s Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix (Septem­ber), and the HSBC Sin­ga­pore Rugby Sev­ens (Oc­to­ber).</p>
    <p>Yesterday’s dia­logue ses­sion was also at­tended by Joaquin Aris­tegui, chief of Spain’s High Coun­cil for Sports, as well as Sin­ga­porean Olympic cham­pion swim­mer Joseph School­ing, and Span­ish bas­ket­ball player and Olympian Alba Tor­rens.</p>
    <p>School­ing, who won the 100m but­ter­fly gold medal at the 2016 Rio Games, ad­mit­ted that he “didn’t think he was ready go­ing into Tokyo 2020”, which was orig­i­nally slated to take place from Fri­day to Aug 9 but has been moved to July 23-Aug 8 next year be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said the ex­tra year has given him a “big boost” as he pre­pares for the de­fence of his ti­tle, and added that men­tally, he had learnt how to chan­nel “neg­a­tive into pos­i­tive”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve gone through some sce­nar­ios over the last few months where I thought, ‘Can I do this again? Can I ever be the same?’ ” said the 25-year-old.</p>
    <p>“And ev­ery time you make a con­scious de­ci­sion to say, ‘Yes, I will be bet­ter’, you are al­ready sur­pass­ing a lot of peo­ple who say, ‘I can’t do this or do that’ or ‘This is too hard’... At the end of the day, it’s those peo­ple who have per­se­ver­ance and will to suc­ceed that will come out on top. And I be­lieve in 2021, it’s go­ing to show. It’s go­ing to be in­ter­est­ing.”</p>
