    <p>Mr Shel­don Adel­son’s Las Ve­gas Sands is ex­plor­ing the sale of its casi­nos in Las Ve­gas, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter, a move that would leave the mogul fo­cused on Asia and mark his exit, for now, from the US gam­bling in­dus­try. Sands is work­ing with an ad­viser to so­licit in­ter­est for three casi­nos in the city.</p>
    <p>Mr Shel­don Adel­son’s Las Ve­gas Sands is ex­plor­ing the sale of its casi­nos in Las Ve­gas, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter, a move that would leave the mogul fo­cused on Asia and mark his exit, for now, from the US gam­bling in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The world’s largest casino com­pany, Sands is work­ing with an ad­viser to so­licit in­ter­est for the Vene­tian Re­sort Las Ve­gas, the Palazzo and the Sands Expo Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, which to­gether may fetch US$6 bil­lion (S$8.2 bil­lion) or more, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple, who asked to not be iden­ti­fied. The prop­er­ties are all con­nected along the city’s fa­mous strip.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Las Ve­gas Sands con­firmed it was in very early dis­cus­sions about a sale and that noth­ing has been fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>A sale would con­cen­trate Sands’ casino port­fo­lio en­tirely in Ma­cau and Sin­ga­pore, where it owns Ma­rina Bay Sands.</p>
    <p>They are the two larger casino mar­kets for the 87-year-old Mr Adel­son, who ranks as one of the world’s rich­est peo­ple, with a for­tune es­ti­mated at US$29.7 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The United States was al­ready a small and shrink­ing part of his busi­ness, ac­count­ing for less than 15 per cent of rev­enue last year.</p>
    <p>“The grow­ing in­signif­i­cance of the US mar­ket ex­plains why Las Ve­gas Sands is look­ing to off­load their US prop­er­ties,” said Mr Ben Lee, a Ma­cau-based man­ag­ing part­ner at IGamiX. “It is 15 per cent of rev­enue but 80 per cent of reg­u­la­tory pain and bur­den.”</p>
    <p>MA­RINA BAY SANDS RE­BOUNDS</p>
    <p>A re­cov­ery in Asia helped im­prove Sands’ op­er­at­ing re­sults in the third quar­ter, Mr Adel­son said in an earn­ings call last week. Sands lost nearly three-quar­ters of a bil­lion dol­lars in the third quar­ter, with Sin­ga­pore the only mar­ket to gen­er­ate pos­i­tive earn­ings.</p>
    <p>The third-quar­ter re­sults last week showed Ma­rina Bay Sands gen­er­ated earn­ings of US$70 mil­lion, 84 per cent lower than a year ago but a big re­ver­sal from the US$113 mil­lion loss it suf­fered in the sec­ond quar­ter af­ter a near-three­month shut­down as part of ef­forts to curb the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue came in at US$281 mil­lion, down 64.6 per cent year on year. Oc­cu­pancy scored a sur­pris­ingly high 55.5 per cent as op­er­a­tions pro­gres­sively re­sumed across the re­sort.</p>
    <p>Sands posted US$586 mil­lion in rev­enue for the three months ended Sept 30, an 82 per cent drop year on year but a ma­jor step up from the US$98 mil­lion it saw in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter. It booked an ad­justed earn­ings loss of US$203 mil­lion in the third quar­ter while re</p>
    <p>port­ing a net loss of US$731 mil­lion ver­sus a US$669 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>MAKES SENSE</p>
    <p>The money from a sale of the Ve­gas casi­nos could al­low the com­pany to fund other de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. Sands dropped out of the com­pe­ti­tion to build a casino in Ja­pan ear­lier this year be­cause of terms that ex­ec­u­tives de­scribed as un­favourable. Mr Adel­son has ex­pressed in­ter­est in build­ing in New York City, an op­por­tu­nity that could arise next year.</p>
    <p>The stock rose as high as 12 per cent in af­ter-hours trad­ing on Mon­day, af­ter Bloomberg re­ported on news of the deal. The shares closed down 3.1 per cent to US$49.13.</p>
    <p>SPOT­LIGHT ON ASIA</p>
    <p>The pos­si­ble sale of its Las Ve­gas as­sets for US$6 bil­lion could fund those Asian projects, while US$6.3 bil­lion of ex­ist­ing liq­uid­ity would be enough to sus­tain idle op­er­a­tions for 17 months.</p>
    <p>MR BRIAN EGGER, Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence se­nior gam­ing and lodg­ing an­a­lyst. Sands is ex­pand­ing in Sin­ga­pore and Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus pan­demic cre­at­ing un­cer­tainty in the Las Ve­gas con­ven­tion busi­ness and an im­plied price for the prop­er­ties of 12 times earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, taxes, de­pre­ci­a­tion and amor­ti­sa­tion, a deal could make sense, said Credit Suisse an­a­lyst Ben Chaiken in a re­search note late on Mon­day. He added the caveat that it is not clear who would buy the casi­nos.</p>
    <p>Mr Adel­son is chair­man, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and the ma­jor­ity share­holder of Las Ve­gas Sands, which has a mar­ket value of US$37.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Casi­nos in Ma­cau, a spe­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive re­gion of China and the world’s big­gest gam­bling mar­ket, gen­er­ated 63 per cent of the com­pany’s US$13.7 bil­lion in rev­enue last year, be­fore the pan­demic struck. Covid-19 has dev­as­tated the casino in­dus­try, as it has other busi­nesses where peo­ple gather in large num­bers, like movie the­atres, con­certs and restau­rants. Sin­ga­pore was the sec­ond big­gest con­trib­u­tor, with 22 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sands is ex­pand­ing in both re­gions, with Ma­cau alone ear­marked for US$2.2 bil­lion in spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence se­nior gam­ing and lodg­ing an­a­lyst Brian Egger said: “The pos­si­ble sale of its Las Ve­gas as­sets for US$6 bil­lion could fund those Asian projects, while US$6.3 bil­lion of ex­ist­ing liq­uid­ity would be enough to sus­tain idle op­er­a­tions for 17 months. China’s lift­ing of re­stric­tions on visas should ben­e­fit Sands in Ma­cau.”</p>
    <p>Ma­cau’s re­cov­ery from Covid-19 re­stric­tions has been slow af­ter China grad­u­ally lifted travel re­stric­tions and formed a travel bub­ble with the gam­bling hub. Main­land Chi­nese vis­i­tor ar­rivals dur­ing China’s Golden Week hol­i­day in early Oc­to­ber were down 84 per cent from a year ear­lier. How­ever, there are signs that gam­blers are start­ing to re­turn in vol­ume as a visa back­log clears.</p>
    <p>“We are see­ing an uptick in real tourists on the ground in Ma­cau,” said IGamiX’s Mr Lee. “The pro­file of the Chi­nese tourists is dom­i­nated by young fe­males and fam­i­lies – mainlander­s tak­ing ad­van­tage of the cheap ac­com­mo­da­tion on of­fer.”</p>
