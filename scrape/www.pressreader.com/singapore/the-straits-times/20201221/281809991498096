    <p>•</p>
    <p>Thais voted na­tion­wide yes­ter­day in pro­vin­cial elec­tions that mark the first test of democ­racy since a gen­eral elec­tion last year that drew ac­cu­sa­tions of ma­nip­u­la­tion and helped spawn months of youth protests.</p>
    <p>The elec­tions in Thai­land’s 76 prov­inces out­side the cap­i­tal Bangkok are the first since Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha, who stayed in power af­ter last year’s bal­lot, over­threw an elected gov­ern­ment in a military coup.</p>
    <p>“It’s my duty to vote,” said 27-year-old bank worker Korkiet Akara­parn, vot­ing in his first pro­vin­cial elec­tion in Non­thaburi, in the out­skirts of Bangkok. “I hope there will be new peo­ple from this elec­tion who bring change.”</p>
    <p>Polling of­fi­cials re­ported a steady turnout de­spite Thai­land’s big­gest daily surge in coro­n­avirus cases on Satur­day in a province out­side of Bangkok. The polls closed at 5pm.</p>
    <p>Among the par­ties putting up can­di­dates is the Pro­gres­sive Move­ment, which has its roots in the now banned Fu­ture For­ward Party of Mr Thanathorn Juan­groon­gru­angkit. Mr Thanathorn had emerged as the most vo­cal chal­lenger to Mr Prayut.</p>
    <p>When he and his party were banned from pol­i­tics, it prompted protests de­mand­ing the re­moval of Mr Prayut, a new Con­sti­tu­tion and re­forms to the pow­er­ful monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut re­jects ac­cu­sa­tions that he en­gi­neered the gen­eral elec­tion to stay in power. Although the party back­ing him in Par­lia­ment is not for­mally putting up can­di­dates in the pro­vin­cial elec­tions, con­tes­tants in races across the coun­try are mak­ing clear their loy­alty to his camp.</p>
    <p>The elec­tions are also a test for the Pheu Thai Party linked to pop</p>
    <p>ulist for­mer prime min­is­ter Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra. It re­mains the largest op­po­si­tion party in Thai­land’s Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Thaksin, who rarely com­ments in pub­lic from self-ex­ile since be­ing over­thrown i n 2006, has posted on Twit­ter to en­cour­age peo­ple to sup­port the party ahead of pro­vin­cial elec­tions, in which pow­er­ful fam­i­lies tra­di­tion­ally hold lo­cal sway.</p>
    <p>Mr Charoen Buaperm, 60, said: “I voted for can­di­dates who are rel­a­tives of the for­mer chief.”</p>
    <p>Pro­vin­cial ad­min­is­tra­tions are re­spon­si­ble for the pro­vi­sion of lo­cal ser­vices and de­vel­op­ment plans, and run their own bud­gets.</p>
    <p>The Pro­gres­sive Move­ment seeks to de­volve more power to prov­inces from Bangkok, which is not yet hold­ing its own lo­cal elec­tion.</p>
