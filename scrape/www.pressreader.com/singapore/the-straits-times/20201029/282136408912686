    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) made it clear that the econ­omy is not out of the woods yet, even af­ter a sharp jump in eco­nomic growth in the July to Septem­ber pe­riod.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts agreed with the cen­tral bank’s assess­ment, say­ing the ne­ces­sity to con­tinue with some so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures for the con­tact-in­ten­sive seg­ments of the ser­vice sec­tor and re­stric­tions on travel will keep the re­cov­ery slow and un­even.</p>
    <p>Even if a vac­cine be­comes avail­able world­wide, it will take more time for the econ­omy to claw its way back to where it was be­fore the Covid-19 out­break than in pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>The re­cov­ery so far – driven mainly by the trade-de­pen­dent man­u­fac­tur­ing, whole­sale, fi­nance and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy (ICT) sec­tors – may also come in fits and starts go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>So af­ter an im­pres­sive re­bound in the third quar­ter from the depths of the worst-ever down­turn in the April-June pe­riod, se­quen­tial growth in the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy is ex­pected to slow in the fourth quar­ter and re­main mod­est next year, MAS said yes­ter­day, in its twice-yearly macroe­co­nomic re­view.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said some seg­ments of the ser­vice sec­tor – like re­tail, food and bev­er­age, hos­pi­tal­ity and avi­a­tion – can­not truly start to re­cover un­til the econ­omy is fully re­opened. “Sin­ga­pore’s re­tail econ­omy is de­pen­dent on tourism. As such, the key hope is for in­bound tourism to ac­cel­er­ate in a post-Covid-19 en­vi­ron­ment, in order for these in­dus­tries to see a mean­ing­ful re­cov­ery,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­cov­ery in eco­nomic growth so far and what­ever is likely to come in sub­se­quent quar­ters will mostly be drawn from the less-af­fected sec­tors, which in­clude man­u­fac­tur­ing, whole­sale, ship­ping, ICT, fi­nance, health and ed­u­ca­tion. To­gether, these sec­tors ac­count for about 63 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s real gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP), ac­cord­ing to MAS data.</p>
    <p>The worst-hit travel-re­lated, con­sumer-fac­ing and con­struc­tion sec­tors rep­re­sent 12 per cent of</p>
    <p>GDP. The sig­nif­i­cantly hit real es­tate sec­tor and other busi­ness ser­vices ac­count for 15 per cent of GDP.</p>
    <p>Although these sec­tors ac­count for a smaller share of GDP com­pared with the ex­ter­nal-ori­ented sec­tors, they gen­er­ate sig­nif­i­cant in­di­rect ef­fects or neg­a­tive spillovers on the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The loss in fi­nal de­mand in the worst-hit sec­tors gen­er­ates rip­ple ef­fects all the way to the sup­pli­ers or pro­duc­ers of the goods and ser­vices, which in turn may re­sult in a pro­por­tional de­crease in wages for em­ploy­ees in these sec­tors and those re­lated to it.</p>
    <p>Some 113,000 jobs were lost and the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate spiked to 3.8 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Fewer jobs mean weaker house­hold or pri­vate con­sump­tion that ac­count for more than 30 per cent of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to MAS data, ev­ery $1,000 de­cline in fi­nal de­mand in the ser­vice sec­tor would re­sult in a $496 loss in value add due to neg­a­tive spillovers across the econ­omy. A sim­i­lar fall in the con­struc­tion and ac­com­mo­da­tion in­dus­tries would lead to a $493 loss in value add, and like­wise, a fall in the food sec­tor would lead to a $385 loss.</p>
    <p>Another pil­lar of GDP growth re­bound in the third quar­ter, sup­port from gov­ern­ment fis­cal spend­ing, is also likely to wane next year. To­tal stim­u­lus re­sponse to the Covid-19 cri­sis has amounted to close to $100 bil­lion. But with the over­all fis­cal deficit at about</p>
    <p>$74 bil­lion, gov­ern­ment help will nar­row down to where it is needed the most.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said: “I wouldn’t rule out a still ex­pan­sion­ary Bud­get come Fe­bru­ary 2021, but the bar has been set so high with nearly $100 bil­lion this year in fis­cal stim­u­lus that they will be hard-pressed to match it.”</p>
    <p>She added: “Greater deficit spend­ing now will mean a big­ger fis­cal short­fall to fill down the road.”</p>
    <p>DBS Bank se­nior econ­o­mist Irvin Seah said that while the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy is on the mend, growth per­for­mance across sec­tors will dif­fer con­sid­er­ably.</p>
    <p>“The ser­vice sec­tor has borne the brunt of the cri­sis and is ex­pected to re­main a drag on growth and em­ploy­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>While, there is no of­fi­cial GDP growth fore­cast for next year, DBS has pen­cilled in 5.5 per cent, af­ter a con­trac­tion of 6 per cent this year. UOB fore­casts stand at mi­nus 5.5 per cent for this year and 5 per cent for next year. OCBC pre­dicts mi­nus 5 per cent for this year and a range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent for next year.</p>
    <p>MAS re­it­er­ated the Gov­ern­ment’s fore­cast for the econ­omy to shrink by a record 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year. It said the econ­omy will post above-trend growth for next year due to the ef­fects of this year’s low base.</p>
