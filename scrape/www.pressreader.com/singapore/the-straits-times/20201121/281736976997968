    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralian mil­i­tary per­son­nel who spoke out against al­leged war crimes in Afghanista­n said yes­ter­day they felt vin­di­cated by an in­quiry that called for pos­si­ble pros­e­cu­tion of troops, as the coun­try re­acted with shame and anger at the find­ings’ sever­ity.</p>
    <p>A re­port pub­lished on Thurs­day found that Aus­tralian spe­cial forces al­legedly killed 39 un­armed pris­on­ers and civil­ians in Afghanista­n, with se­nior com­man­dos forc­ing ju­nior sol­diers to kill de­fence­less cap­tives i n or­der to “blood” them for com­bat.</p>
    <p>The re­port rec­om­mended re­fer­ring 19 cur­rent and for­mer sol­diers for po­ten­tial pros­e­cu­tion, in a de­vel­op­ment that prompted an­guish in Aus­tralia, which usu­ally hon­ours its mil­i­tary his­tory with fer­vour.</p>
    <p>David McBride, a for­mer mil­i­tary lawyer fac­ing charges of leak­ing in­for­ma­tion about spe­cial forces ac­tions in Afghanista­n, felt “buoyed” by the re­port af­ter years of be­ing treated like a “traitor to the dig­gers”, his lawyer Mark Davis told Reuters, us­ing the Aus­tralian slang for sol­diers.</p>
    <p>“If the ac­cu­sa­tions that he’s pre­vi­ously made are proven right, he will feel vin­di­cated what­ever the penalty,” Mr Davis said by tele­phone. “His rep­u­ta­tion will be in­tact and his sense of hon­our will be in­tact.”</p>
    <p>McBride has con­firmed giv­ing clas­si­fied doc­u­ments to the Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Corp (ABC), trig­ger­ing charges against him and an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the pub­lic broad­caster, which sen­sa­tion­ally led to a raid on its Syd­ney head­quar­ters last year.</p>
    <p>Po­lice dropped the ABC in­ves­ti­ga­tion last month, cit­ing a lack of pub­lic in­ter­est in pro­ceed­ing, but McBride still faces a lengthy prison sen­tence if found guilty af­ter a trial, which will start next year.</p>
    <p>His charges must now also be dropped, said Mr Davis.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial forces medic Dusty Miller, who tes­ti­fied at the in­quiry, told the ABC that hear­ing the coun­try’s de­fence chief pub­licly con­firm his claims was “com­plete vin­di­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>The re­port has been de­scribed by Aus­tralian lead­ers as one of the dark­est mil­i­tary chap­ters for the coun­try, just nine days af­ter the na­tion’s Re­mem­brance Day for fallen sol­diers – when it is cus­tom­ary to wear a red poppy to show re­spect.</p>
    <p>Top law­mak­ers walked a del­i­cate line of con­demn­ing the al­le­ga­tions of the re­port and sup­port­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of pros­e­cu­tions, while ex­press­ing sol­i­dar­ity with the coun­try’s armed forces.</p>
    <p>“It made me phys­i­cally ill, and it was a very dis­tress­ing read,” said De­fence Min­is­ter Linda Reynolds, a for­mer army of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>“I know that it cer­tainly didn’t rep­re­sent my ser­vice... and it cer­tainly doesn’t rep­re­sent the ma­jor­ity of men and women who have and con­tinue to serve our na­tion with such great dis­tinc­tion.”</p>
    <p>Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg said the al­le­ga­tions were “very se­ri­ous but they should not over­shadow the im­mense good work that is be­ing done by the de­fence forces in our name”.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son warned ear­lier that the re­port would be trou­bling for Aus­tralia and its mil­i­tary, but he has not com­mented since its pub­li­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the of­fice of Afghan Pres­i­dent Ashraf Ghani said on Twit­ter that Mr Mor­ri­son had “ex­pressed his deep­est sor­row” over the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Reynolds said last week that Can­berra had been ad­vised that lo­cal pros­e­cu­tion would negate charges at the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court at The Hague.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in Kabul, the Afghan cap­i­tal, wel­comed the prospect of bring­ing per­pe­tra­tors to jus­tice, but were di­vided on the ques­tion of where.</p>
    <p>“They who have com­mit­ted such a big crime must be handed to face the law of Afghanista­n and should be pun­ished ac­cord­ingly,” said Kabul res­i­dent Ab­dul Mu­ta­hal.</p>
    <p>Shi’ite imam Mo­ham­mad Isaaq Fa­iaz said the al­leged per­pe­tra­tors “should be brought to jus­tice in Aus­tralia, and the af­fected fam­i­lies of those mar­tyred must be paid with the ran­som”.</p>
