    <p>There is no pro­vi­sion un­der the In­dia-Sin­ga­pore Com­pre­hen­sive Economic Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment (Ceca) for In­dian na­tion­als to be­come Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents and cit­i­zens, said the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI).</p>
    <p>And it is not true that Ceca re­quires the Sin­ga­pore au­thor­i­ties to au­to­mat­i­cally grant em­ploy­ment passes (EPs) to pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers and ex­ec­u­tives (PMEs) from In­dia who want to work here, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>The min­istry, in a state­ment yes­ter­day, was re­spond­ing to me­dia queries af­ter the mer­its of the pact, which was signed in 2005, have come un­der scru­tiny again in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>None of Sin­ga­pore’s free trade agree­ments, in­clud­ing Ceca, make it an obli­ga­tion for the Repub­lic to au­to­mat­i­cally grant EPs to any for­eign na­tion­als, the MTI state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“All for­eign na­tion­als ap­ply­ing for EP must meet our pre­vail­ing cri­te­ria, and all com­pa­nies must com­ply with rules on fair hir­ing,” the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are un­der­stand­ably con­cerned about com­pe­ti­tion from for­eign PMEs amid the chal­leng­ing economic and em­ploy­ment sit­u­a­tion, said MTI.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is mis­lead­ing to at­tribute the num­ber of In­dian PMEs solely or mainly to Ceca, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>This was es­pe­cially so, MTI said, for “in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees” or those who are trans­ferred from a com­pany’s over­seas unit to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This cat­e­gory of work­ers in Sin­ga­pore has con­sis­tently been at be­low 5 per cent of all em­ploy­ment pass hold­ers in Sin­ga­pore, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>They also come from a wide range of coun­tries, with In­dian na­tion­als mak­ing up only a small seg­ment, it added.</p>
    <p>Un­der Ceca, such trans­fer­ees are re­quired to have worked for their com­pany for a pe­riod of not less than six months, among other con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>They are also al­lowed to stay for a to­tal pe­riod of not more than eight years.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time Ceca has come un­der the spot­light.</p>
    <p>Claims that the bi­lat­eral trade agree­ment has al­lowed In­dian na­tion­als to take PME jobs meant for Sin­ga­pore­ans re-emerged last year, af­ter an ex­ple­tive-laden video sur­faced on­line show­ing an In­dian na­tional lash­ing out at a se­cu­rity guard at a con­do­minium.</p>
