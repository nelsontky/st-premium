    <p>When In­done­sia’s Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo was first cam­paign­ing for the post in 2014, he un­veiled a list of nine ob­jec­tives he hoped to achieve dur­ing his ten­ure.</p>
    <p>The fourth point of his “Nawa Cita” – San­skrit for nine ideals – was a vow to clean up the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“We will re­ject a weak state by re­form­ing the sys­tem and en­forc­ing the law that is free of cor­rup­tion and built on dig­nity and trust,” the dec­la­ra­tion read.</p>
    <p>But a con­tro­ver­sial con­vic­tion last week of a pair of ju­nior po­lice of­fi­cers ac­cused of dous­ing a top cor­rup­tion in­ves­ti­ga­tor with acid has added to wor­ries that Mr Joko’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has strug­gled to rein in ram­pant graft.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, a Jakarta court found con­sta­bles Ronny Bugis and Rah­mat Kadir Mahulette guilty of the April 11, 2017, acid at­tack that par­tially blinded Mr Novel Baswedan, a se­nior in­ves­ti­ga­tor with the Cor­rup­tion Erad­i­ca­tion Com­mis­sion (KPK). The pair were sen­tenced to 18 months and two years in jail, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Po­lice had been crit­i­cised for slow progress on the case.</p>
    <p>A po­lice team was formed in Jan­uary last year to in­ves­ti­gate the at­tack, but their ef­forts came to naught. Mr Joko then or­dered that a new po­lice chief, ap­pointed in Novem­ber, solve the case by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>When Mr Novel was at­tacked, he had been lead­ing a KPK probe into the 2.6 tril­lion ru­piah (S$246 mil­lion) scam linked to the roll-out of new ID cards.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion re­sulted in the 2018 con­vic­tion of sit­ting Speaker Setya No­vanto, who was sen­tenced to 15 years in prison.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the verdict last Thurs­day, Mr Novel told The Sun­day Times that he was wor­ried for his safety. He re­peated his as­ser­tion that the guilty men were fall guys and the true cul­prits be­hind his at­tack were still at large.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment of In­done­sia is not in favour of fight­ing cor­rup­tion,” he said. “It’s dif­fi­cult to say whether I or my col­leagues will be able to work safely af­ter this in­ci­dent.”</p>
    <p>The verdict came just months af­ter leg­is­la­tion last year that se­verely cur­tailed the KPK’s pow­ers to con­duct in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tions in se­cret.</p>
    <p>The new law also ended the body’s civil­ian lead­er­ship and placed it un­der the con­trol of the po­lice, who used to be fre­quent tar­gets of KPK in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>For Mr Joko, who has made faster eco­nomic growth the cen­tre­piece of his sec­ond and fi­nal term, a softer touch on cor­rup­tion risks back­fir­ing, said an­a­lyst Ben Bland, di­rec­tor of the South-east Asia Pro­gramme at the Syd­ney-based Lowy In­sti­tute. “In­creas­ingly, Jokowi’s gov­ern­ment seems to see the an­ticor­rup­tion fight as an im­ped­i­ment to the Pres­i­dent’s am­bi­tions for pro­mot­ing in­vest­ment and eco­nomic growth,” Mr Bland said, re­fer­ring to the Pres­i­dent’s ubiq­ui­tous nick­name.</p>
    <p>Wor­ries of be­ing tarred with cor­rup­tion charges have made some pub­lic of­fi­cials wary of pro­mot­ing in­fra­struc­ture ini­tia­tives, said Mr Bland, au­thor of the up­com­ing book, Man Of Con­tra­dic­tions: Joko Wi­dodo And The Strug­gle To Re­make In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, by par­ing back the KPK’s au­thor­ity and crimp­ing its in­de­pen­dence, Mr Joko risks do­ing longer-term dam­age, Mr Bland said.</p>
    <p>“The weak­en­ing of the KPK and the roll­back of the wider cam­paign against graft are likely to dam­age the long-term busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, rather than im­prove it.”</p>
    <p>While In­done­sia has made progress in tack­ling graft un­der Mr Joko, it still ranks poorly on Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional’s 2019 Cor­rup­tion Per­cep­tions In­dex, along­side China and Turkey.</p>
    <p>“The Novel Baswedan case is con­fir­ma­tion that the gov­ern­ment is less will­ing to up­hold its prom­ise in fight­ing cor­rup­tion,” said Mr Ad­nan Topan Husodo, co­or­di­na­tor for non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion In­done­sia Cor­rup­tion Watch. “The fu­ture of KPK has been se­verely af­fected by the de­ci­sion to re­vise the law gov­ern­ing it.”</p>
