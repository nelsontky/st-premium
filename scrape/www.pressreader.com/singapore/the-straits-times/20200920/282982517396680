    <p>It has been a while since the nor­mally peri­patetic Tony Lom­bardo got on a plane, ei­ther to travel to one of the spots in Asia where his com­pany, Lendlease, is de­vel­op­ing a project or prospect­ing for one, or go­ing home to see his mother and sib­lings in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>The last time he made a trip – dur­ing this year’s Chi­nese New</p>
    <p>Year hol­i­day week­end, when he took his wife to Cam­bo­dia – most of his time was spent plan­ning to proac­tively shut down con­struc­tion in China to keep his staff safe from the pan­demic. Lendlease was one of the first big com­pa­nies in Asia to ban of­fi­cial travel by staff.</p>
    <p>“We were trans­par­ent with our peo­ple about what’s go­ing on,” says Mr Lom­bardo, 46. “Peo­ple were wor­ried about their jobs, fam­ily, health... just about ev­ery­thing. My dad com­mit­ted sui­cide when I was 21, so I know men­tal health can be one of those hidden killers. We wanted to help our staff stay grounded.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Se­cu­ri­ties Ex­change-listed Lendlease, which has a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of about A$8 bil­lion (S$7.93 bil­lion), in­vests, builds and de­vel­ops mixed-use projects across Euro­pean, Aus­tralian and Asian gate­way cities. It also has a big pres­ence in the United States, where a ma­jor client is Google.</p>
    <p>Tasked ini­tially to build the In­ter­net search com­pany’s Lon­don of­fice, Lendlease was sub­se­quently con­tracted to work on Google’s prop­erty hold­ings in San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>A re­sult­ing two-year con­sul­tancy helped it to be se­lected as the pre­ferred de­vel­op­ment part­ner for up to 15 mil­lion sq ft of res­i­den­tial, re­tail, hospi­tal­ity and as­so­ci­ated com­mu­nity uses across three ma­jor cities in the Bay Area.</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, like the long beams on its con­struc­tion sites en­gi­neered to with­stand earth­quakes, Lendlease is cop­ing with the fall­out from two seis­mic events – Covid-19 and an exit from its in­fra­struc­ture-fo­cused en­gi­neer­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s core busi­ness is the con­struc­tion, in­vest­ment and de­vel­op­ment of real es­tate prop­er­ties. A solid core op­er­at­ing Ebitda (earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, tax, de­pre­ci­a­tion and amor­ti­sa­tion) of A$628 mil­lion in the first half was fol­lowed by a A$65 mil­lion loss in the sec­ond half, re­flect­ing the dis­rup­tions caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A strat­egy change that saw it exit the en­gi­neer­ing busi­ness cost A$368 mil­lion af­ter tax, along with A$19 mil­lion in good­will im­pair­ment.</p>
    <p>All that led to the iconic Aus­tralian com­pany re­port­ing a statu­tory loss af­ter tax of A$310 mil­lion for the year ended June 30.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis re­ori­ented Lendlease to be­come even more fo­cused on cost and liq­uid­ity man­age­ment, although it has man­aged to keep staff cuts to a hand­ful in Asia – mostly in places where a project has ended and the next ones are yet to come on stream.</p>
    <p>“The pri­or­ity was first on safety, then to just man­age the liq­uid­ity of the busi­ness be­cause you just have to make sure you have the right cash flow to get through the cri­sis,” Mr Lom­bardo says.</p>
    <p>Still, Lendlease com­pleted sev­eral large-scale projects and ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing the de­vel­op­ment of Paya Le­bar Quar­ter in Sin­ga­pore, while adding A$3.3 bil­lion of funds un­der man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>It also listed the Lendlease Global Com­mer­cial Reit in Sin­ga­pore last Oc­to­ber, ini­tially com­pris­ing a lease­hold in­ter­est in Sin­ga­pore’s 313@som­er­set and three of­fice build­ings in Mi­lan, Italy.</p>
    <p>The Reit re­cently won the ten­der to re­de­velop the 48,200 sq ft site in Grange Road, cur­rently an open park, into a mul­ti­func­tional event space.</p>
    <p>Con­tracts like th­ese help keep jobs. When com­pared with air­lines, travel and leisure, says Mr Lom­bardo, it is a re­lief that most of the com­pany’s 1,400 em­ploy­ees in Asia are able to keep their jobs. He sees the un­cer­tainty lasting at least an­other year. Mean­while, other op­por­tu­ni­ties are be­ing pur­sued vig­or­ously.</p>
    <p>In­deed, he has made some big-ticket hires lately, in­clud­ing lur­ing Mr Sam Lee away from Global Switch to run Lendlease Data Cen­tre Part­ners, a US$1 bil­lion (S$1.36 bil­lion) joint ven­ture, with an eye to the ac­cel­er­at­ing de­mand for such fa­cil­i­ties across the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>“My big push for us as a busi­ness has been at the lead­er­ship level. Every­one we’ve brought in are lo­cals across Asia. And so, we’ve been for­tu­nate to hire peo­ple like Hsueh Ling Ng, who runs our Sin­ga­pore busi­ness – she came from Kep­pel Reit and be­fore that, Cap­i­taLand – and we hired a pretty se­nior gen­tle­man in Ding Hui, who runs our China op­er­a­tions,” says Mr Lom­bardo.</p>
    <p>Over the past five years, Lendlease in­vest­ments in Asian as­sets and projects have risen from A$600 mil­lion to A$1.5 bil­lion. Un­til the pan­demic up­ended ev­ery­thing, Asia had been de­liv­er­ing profit af­ter tax of about A$100 mil­lion a year.</p>
    <p>“It will prob­a­bly dip back this year and maybe the fol­low­ing year. Some of our con­struc­tion projects are tak­ing longer to com­plete,” says Mr Lom­bardo. “The goal is for Asia to be con­tribut­ing about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the group’s profit, ul­ti­mately.”</p>
    <p>Lendlease has iden­ti­fied 17 ur­ban ag­glom­er­a­tions that it calls “gate­way cities”, in four re­gions. It is cur­rently op­er­at­ing in 15 of them. In Asia, its pres­ence spans Sin­ga­pore, Shang­hai and Kuala Lumpur, where it is build­ing the Tun Razak Ex­change for the Min­istry of Fi­nance and, in an ear­lier day, project-man­aged the Petronas Twin Tow­ers.</p>
    <p>The Tun Razak Ex­change was briefly con­tro­ver­sial be­cause it was ini­ti­ated by the 1MDB fund but has since been en­dorsed by the Ma­hathir and Muhyid­din gov­ern­ments. In Fe­bru­ary last year, then Fi­nance Min­is­ter Lim Guan Eng said the project had been “detox­i­fied”.</p>
    <p>Two years away from its com­ple­tion, re­tail and res­i­den­tial pre-com­mit­ments have both been strong, says Mr Lom­bardo.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also eye­ing projects in Tokyo and Osaka and has done what Mr Lom­bardo calls a “fair bit of re­search” on the In­dian cities of Ban­ga­lore, Chen­nai and Mum­bai. Oddly, Jakarta does not seem a pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>“(In­done­sia) has just been com­plex,” he says, pick­ing his words care­fully. “There are some re­ally big lead­ers in the real es­tate in­dus­try that are good lo­cal play­ers, and you do need to as­sess your abil­ity to com­pete in that mar­ket. Like­wise for Bangkok.”</p>
    <p>Lendlease re­freshes its cor­po­rate strat­egy ev­ery decade or so, and the most re­cent up­date was an­nounced ear­lier this month. The cur­rent fo­cus ap­pears to be on the ur­ban­i­sa­tion space – the com­pany is in­volved in 21 projects around the world – ex­pand­ing in gate­way cities in all the growth mar­kets and dou­bling the num­ber of projects to put on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>It also is push­ing to grow its funds man­age­ment, which has quadru­pled in re­cent years to a A$37 bil­lion busi­ness. Lendlease be­lieves it could take that fig­ure to A$100 bil­lion in a decade.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, it is mak­ing a ma­jor thrust in dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, us­ing tech­nol­ogy to shift the way build­ings are de­signed and built. Thus the sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ment in Lendlease Podium, a prop­erty life-cy­cle plat­form in­cor­po­rat­ing dig­i­tal prod­ucts and services.</p>
    <p>“The con­struc­tion in­dus­try was us­ing BIM – build­ing in­for­ma­tion man­age­ment – but we were dumb­ing it down as we re-ten­dered to con­trac­tors and so never lever­aged (dig­i­tal) to the full ex­tent. We are tak­ing it to the next level. The next decade will see a very dif­fer­ent ap­proach to how the whole sup­ply chain for the con­struc­tion in­dus­try works.”</p>
    <p>Given all the re­cent dis­cus­sions about man­power-heavy con­struc­tion in Sin­ga­pore, I am cu­ri­ous to learn where we are in up­dat­ing build­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, Dubai shows off some of its “3D printed” build­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Lom­bardo says a few years ago, the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity drove what is called “vol­u­met­ric con­struc­tion”. So, in Tuas for in­stance, you will see con­struc­tion be­ing done in a man­u­fac­tur­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Today, the trend is to move con­struc­tion into the ware­house and then move it to the site for “as­sem­bly”. Sin­ga­pore has been lead­ing this ef­fort of stan­dar­d­is­ing into a fac­tory-type en­vi­ron­ment, he says. As for 3D-printed build­ings, they are harder to do once you get into more com­plex types of build­ings.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, where it has had a pres­ence since 1973, will al­ways be the “big area” for Lendlease in Asia, he says. Hav­ing done sev­eral large de­vel­op­ments here, Lendlease is po­si­tion­ing it­self to bid for sev­eral large projects com­ing into the pipe­line in the next 18 months, such as Kam­pong Bugis, an 8.3ha project next to Kal­lang Basin that could be in ex­cess of $10 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“When you move up that scale curve, it al­lows you to think dif­fer­ently about how to go and ex­e­cute a project of that scale, plus its longevity of 10 to 11 years,” he says.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore aside, he re­mains bullish on the China busi­ness, where Lendlease’s first se­nior-liv­ing vil­lage in the coun­try, built with ex­pe­ri­ence gained in its home mar­ket in Aus­tralia, is poised to be­gin sales in the last quar­ter of the year. The coun­try is at a tip­ping point with its age­ing pop­u­la­tion and one-child pol­icy putting a strain on fam­i­lies be­cause many have four grand­par­ents to care for.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also has to keep a weather eye on the shift­ing sands of the re­gion’s geopol­i­tics and a trans-Asian eco­nomic slow­down that had started even be­fore the pan­demic struck, weigh­ing heav­ily on the main­land’s debt-gorged prop­erty de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Just a few weeks ago, for in­stance, China’s Poly Global prop­erty group dropped a late-stage deal with Lendlease about buy­ing Bin­gara Gorge, a 200ha res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ment and golf course in Syd­ney. The deal was touted at A$300 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view.</p>
    <p>As for Lendlease it­self, most fi­nan­cial an­a­lysts seem san­guine about its prospects, not­ing its strong bal­ance sheet and low gear­ing.</p>
    <p>The manda­tory shut­downs that fol­lowed the rapid on­set of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 caught the com­pany un­pre­pared, the Mot­ley Fool ad­vi­sory wrote re­cently. Nev­er­the­less, it has strength­ened its bal­ance sheet, filled up its de­vel­op­ment pipe­line, and se­cured new work worth bil­lions. “The com­pany is likely to see a recovery of its busi­ness, rather than a pro­longed down­turn,” it added.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians are known for plain speech, and I asked how, born and raised in Aus­tralia, he was cop­ing with the Asian cul­ture of po­lite­ness and giv­ing face. Mr Lom­bardo says his wife’s Chi­nese eth­nic­ity and his own Ital­ian roots come in handy.</p>
    <p>“The Ital­ian cul­ture is quite sim­i­lar to the Asian cul­ture, when it comes to fam­ily life, face and food,” he tells me.</p>
