    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s new leader will aim to beef up se­cu­rity ties when he vis­its Viet­nam and In­done­sia next week amid con­cerns about Bei­jing’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness, but is likely to steer clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by US coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, whose re­sume is scant on diplo­matic ex­pe­ri­ence, will fol­low in pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe’s foot­steps by mak­ing the two South­east Asian na­tions the des­ti­na­tions for his first over­seas trip since tak­ing of­fice last month.</p>
    <p>“I think it is im­por­tant to show... we put more em­pha­sis and im­por­tance on that re­gion and we are in­ter­ested in the se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion, es­pe­cially in the South China Sea,” said for­mer diplo­mat Ku­ni­hiko Miyake, a spe­cial ad­viser to Mr Suga.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga is ex­pected to visit Viet­nam, chair of the 10-mem­ber Asean group­ing, and In­done­sia, its big­gest econ­omy, dur­ing a four-day trip from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan must bal­ance its deep eco­nomic ties with China with se­cu­rity con­cerns, in­clud­ing Bei­jing’s push to assert claims over dis­puted East China Sea isles.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe over­saw an im­prove­ment in ties, but some rul­ing party MPs want a tougher stance.</p>
    <p>Asean mem­bers, many of which have ter­ri­to­rial feuds with China in vi­tal South China Sea wa­ter­ways, are wary of alien­at­ing a big eco­nomic part­ner and re­luc­tant to be­come en­trapped in an in­tense con­fronta­tion between the United States and China.</p>
    <p>Dr Scott Harold, as­so­ciate di­rec­tor at the Rand Cor­po­ra­tion’s Cen­tre for Asia-Pa­cific Pol­icy, said that Ja­pan’s ap­proach is to be firm, calm and ad­vance its in­ter­ests with­out ask­ing coun­tries to ex­plic­itly push back against China.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan plans to sign an agree­ment with Viet­nam to al­low it to ex­port de­fence equip­ment and tech­nol­ogy to the coun­try, the Nikkei news­pa­per re­ported this week.</p>
    <p>A Ja­panese of­fi­cial said Ja­pan was talk­ing about en­hanc­ing de­fence co­op­er­a­tion with both Hanoi and Jakarta, but could not com­ment on the out­comes.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s visit also co­in­cides with Ja­pan’s ef­forts to di­ver­sify its sup­ply chains and re­duce re­liance on China by bring­ing pro­duc­tion home or lo­cat­ing more in South­east Asia.</p>
    <p>He will likely an­nounce an ex­pan­sion of Ja­pan’s sub­si­dies for pro­duc­tion in South-east Asia on his trip, the Nikkei said.</p>
