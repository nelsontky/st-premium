    <p>HONG KONG • A multi-mil­lion-dol­lar prop­erty sale by the United States con­sulate in Hong Kong has been put on ice be­cause it has not re­ceived per­mis­sion from Bei­jing, the prospec­tive buyer said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The deal for six lux­ury pads in a swanky part of the is­land would have seen the US State Depart­ment pocket US$330 mil­lion (S$437 mil­lion). But it ap­pears to have fallen vic­tim to grow­ing ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing, which in­sisted it was no or­di­nary prop­erty trans­ac­tion and needed a spe­cific go-ahead.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries have been at log­ger­heads for months over trade, hu­man rights and a clam­p­down on Hong Kong, with Bei­jing in­creas­ingly will­ing to wield its eco­nomic power to push back against what it says is Amer­i­can in­ter­fer­ence in in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Lung Prop­er­ties had agreed to pay HK$2.6 bil­lion (S$444 mil­lion) for the six plots ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day, it said the sale could not be com­pleted as sched­uled, be­cause Hong Kong’s Land Reg­istry had not re­ceived writ­ten con­sent from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it had re­ceived a let­ter from the Land Reg­istry ad­vis­ing that the “sale of the prop­erty in­volves for­eign af­fairs be­tween the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China and the United States, and should not be re­garded as an or­di­nary com­mer­cial ac­tiv­ity”.</p>
    <p>Hang Lung said it had been told the US govern­ment had a “diplo­matic obli­ga­tion” to make a writ­ten ap­pli­ca­tion to Bei­jing at least 60 days prior to any in­tended real es­tate trans­ac­tion in Hong Kong, and ob­tain writ­ten con­sent for it; and that the Land Reg­istry could not pro­ceed with­out this. The com­pany said it was not made aware of this re­quire­ment be­fore­hand.</p>
    <p>A US con­sulate spokesman said ad­di­tional time was needed for both the buyer and seller.</p>
    <p>“The State Depart­ment is not at lib­erty to com­ment on the spe­cific terms of on­go­ing con­trac­tual transactio­ns,” he said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin later said the ap­pli­ca­tion re­quire­ment was “in the light of US reg­u­la­tions on the man­age­ment of reg­is­tered prop­er­ties of for­eign mis­sions in the United States and based on the prin­ci­ple of rec­i­proc­ity”.</p>
    <p>“Only when they get the ap­proval in writ­ing can they pro­ceed,” Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the ten­der for the prop­erty ear­lier this year, many de­vel­op­ers in the main­land and Hong Kong were hes­i­tant to ven­ture an of­fer be­cause it was seen as po­lit­i­cally sen­si­tive.</p>
