    <p>A pair of smart glasses de­signed to help de­men­tia pa­tients suf­fer­ing from mem­ory loss recog­nise their loved ones has earned three stu­dents from Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic (SP) a top tech­nol­ogy award.</p>
    <p>Ms Nashita Fa­tima, 20, Ms Chen Zi­han, 22, and Ms Fang Qian, 20, won the grand prize in the In­no­va­tion cat­e­gory of the Huawei ICT Com­pe­ti­tion last month.</p>
    <p>The glasses are a blend of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) and In­ter­net of Things (IoT) tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Two mod­ules con­tain­ing small cam­eras are mounted on the sides of the frame. Pro­vided with im­ages of the user’s fam­ily mem­bers that are up­loaded onto a server, the glasses’ AI can be trained to recog­nise faces that are picked up by the cam­eras. The soft­ware is also able to read out the names of fam­ily mem­bers and state how they are re­lated to the user.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ent com­po­nents are able to com­mu­ni­cate be­cause, like all IoT de­vices, the glasses are con­nected to the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>The team, from SP’s School of Elec­tri­cal and Elec­tronic Engi­neer­ing, also built a com­pan­ion mo­bile app that al­lows fam­ily mem­bers to track where the glasses and their user are via the Global Po­si­tion­ing Sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Huawei cloud tech­nol­ogy was used for data stor­age and sev­eral other fea­tures, while the team’s AI model was de­vel­oped on Huawei’s AI plat­form ModelArts.</p>
    <p>The fifth edi­tion of the an­nual com­pe­ti­tion drew nearly 150,000 stu­dents from some 2,000 col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties in 82 coun­tries, with the num­bers nar­rowed down to 327 stu­dents in 109 teams at the Nov 6-14 global fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Ms Fang, leader of the SP team, said they were in­spired by the For­get-Me-Not Cafe TV show, which fea­tured five el­derly wait­ers with mild cog­ni­tive im­pair­ment serv­ing food at a Chi­nese restau­rant.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing our re­search, we dis­cov­ered that there are many prod­ucts (blend­ing AI and IoT) de­signed to in­crease peo­ple’s qual­ity of life, but not many are tar­geted at the el­derly,” said Ms Fang.</p>
    <p>The trio hope to im­prove on the glasses – the demo ver­sion of which was shown at the com­pe­ti­tion – by mak­ing them smaller and eas­ier to wear. They are also ex­plor­ing adding a function to record the voices of fam­ily mem­bers so that users can hear their loved ones iden­ti­fy­ing them­selves in­stead of the ro­botic voice cur­rently used.</p>
    <p>Huawei In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ni­cholas Ma said: “We are thrilled with the cre­ativ­ity of these young Sin­ga­pore tal­ents, and proud to help these seeds of the fu­ture as­cend to the top of the world.”</p>
    <p>Two other teams from Sin­ga­pore also took part in the global fi­nals.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond team from SP built a soft­ware sys­tem that senses when an el­derly per­son falls, while a Te­masek Polytech­nic trio de­signed a sys­tem that au­to­mates the process of de­tect­ing a for­est fire.</p>
    <p>Two mod­ules con­tain­ing small cam­eras are mounted on the sides of the frame. Pro­vided with im­ages of the user’s fam­ily mem­bers that are up­loaded onto a server, the glasses’ AI can be trained to recog­nise faces that are picked up by the cam­eras.</p>
