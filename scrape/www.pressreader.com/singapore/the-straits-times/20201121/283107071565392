    <p>HONG KONG • It seems im­pos­si­ble to imag­ine come­dies such as Golden Chicken (2002) and 1992’s Royal Tramp with­out Hong Kong ac­tress Sandra Ng (left). But early in her ca­reer, the grad­u­ate of broad­caster TVB’s artist pro­gramme in 1983 said she had doubted her­self af­ter see­ing her peers land lead­ing roles while she got the small ones.</p>
    <p>The ac­tors who were in the same batch as her in­clude Sean Lau, Ca­rina Lau, Lawrence Ng and Michael Tao.</p>
    <p>Ng, 55, said the whole ex­pe­ri­ence left her won­der­ing if she was cut out for show busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“I even thought of quit­ting af­ter I was asked to take part in va­ri­ety pro­grammes, as I thought of my­self as an ac­tress and not some­one tak­ing up funny roles in va­ri­ety shows,” she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ng be­gan to get no­ticed af­ter her ap­pear­ances in the shows and she was ap­proached to take up comic roles in sev­eral movies, in­clud­ing The Crazy Com­pa­nies (1988) and All’s Well, Ends Well (1992).</p>
    <p>The ac­tress re­vealed all this in an in­ter­view with Clara Lu, the 17-year-old daugh­ter of fa­mous Chi­nese vi­olin­ist Yao Jue, on Lu’s non-profit on­line learn­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>Ng, who has acted in more than 100 movies, said The In­spec­tor Wears Skirts (1988), Port­land Street Blues (1998) and Echoes Of The Rain­bow (2010) were some of her favourites movies which she had acted in.</p>
    <p>While she won the Best Ac­tress ac­co­lade at Tai­wan’s Golden Horse Awards for her role as a pros­ti­tute in the movie Golden Chicken, she is not one to rest on her lau­rels.</p>
    <p>She said act­ing re­quires con­stant prac­tice and she is tak­ing lessons as she hopes to im­prove fur­ther.</p>
