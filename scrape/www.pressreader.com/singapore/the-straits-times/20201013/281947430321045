    <p>For decades, the Tai­wan is­sue has oc­ca­sion­ally roiled US-China re­la­tions and then re­ceded to the back burner. But now, with Sino-US ties at their low­est point and a dis­tracted, pug­na­cious US Pres­i­dent des­per­ately look­ing for a means to avoid go­ing down in de­feat next month, anx­i­ety is grow­ing on both sides of the strait that the chances of a con­flict over Tai­wan are steadily ris­ing.</p>
    <p>News that Mr Don­ald Trump tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 drew lit­tle sym­pa­thy from Chi­nese so­cial me­dia users for the United States Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In­stead, de­ri­sion dom­i­nated their re­sponse, with many mock­ing him for mis­man­ag­ing the pan­demic and blam­ing Bei­jing for Covid-19’s im­pact. The re­sponse was not sur­pris­ing as Mr Trump is pos­si­bly the most hated US pres­i­dent in China since nor­mal­i­sa­tion in 1979, one seen by many Chi­nese to be bul­ly­ing Bei­jing on mul­ti­ple fronts.</p>
    <p>Some see an election ploy, given how the US leader is trail­ing his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den in the polls with just weeks to go be­fore the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial election. Mr Trump has been us­ing his in­fec­tion “to keep him­self in the me­dia spot­light to strengthen his base and stim­u­late more votes for him”, said the Global Times, a tabloid af­fil­i­ated with China’s of­fi­cial Peo­ple’s Daily. “For some Amer­i­cans, see­ing the Pres­i­dent re­cover... in merely three days is even more ex­cit­ing than see­ing a vac­cine come out,” it added.</p>
    <p>But at the of­fi­cial level, Pres­i­dent Trump’s ill­ness is any­thing but good news for China as it is seen as in­ject­ing greater lev­els of un­cer­tainty into al­ready fraught bi­lat­eral ties. The worry is that Mr Trump, al­ready no­to­ri­ous for sud­den er­ratic moves, may de­cide to pull a late-October sur­prise to dis­tract vot­ers and get Amer­i­cans to rally round the flag.</p>
    <p>Pok­ing China in the eye in sen­si­tive ar­eas such as Tai­wan or the South China Sea is not in­con­ceiv­able as Bei­jing can­not not come out with a strong re­sponse, and that would in turn feed into the anti-China sen­ti­ments that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been stok­ing among Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>For an in­creas­ing num­ber of Chi­nese aca­demics and busi­ness­men, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, the big ques­tion now is not so much whom China prefers – Mr Trump or Mr Bi­den – as the next US pres­i­dent, but what Mr Trump will do to re­main in power. “Trump is un­pre­dictable and will spare no ef­fort to be re-elected, in­clud­ing cre­at­ing chaos and sab­o­tag­ing the world or­der,” a party of­fi­cial told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>THE TAI­WAN SCE­NAR­IOS</p>
    <p>For all their fears, pun­dits in China do not think the US will do some­thing as rad­i­cal as recog­nis­ing Tai­wan as an in­de­pen­dent coun­try; such a move would trig­ger a Chi­nese at­tack on the is­land as man­dated by the Anti-Se­ces­sion Law passed by China’s Par­lia­ment in 2005.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent chat­ter among Bei­jing’s elite is about the pos­si­bil­ity that Pres­i­dent Trump might recog­nise Tai­wan’s Repub­lic of China (ROC) with­out sev­er­ing ties with the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>Such a move puts pres­sure on Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping as it is more nu­anced than out­right recog­ni­tion of an in­de­pen­dent Tai­wan. It tosses the ball into Bei­jing’s court: China has at least three op­tions for how best to re­spond, none of which is ideal.</p>
    <p>First, Bei­jing could sever diplo­matic re­la­tions with Washington and then de­clare a re­sump­tion of the civil war be­tween Bei­jing and Taipei. (Kuom­intang (KMT) troops fled from China to Tai­wan in 1949 af­ter los­ing the civil war. De­tente be­tween the CCP and the then KMT-led gov­ern­ment be­gan in the 1980s but for China, tech­ni­cally, the civil war never ended as no ar­mistice was ever signed.)</p>
    <p>Push­ing Tai­wan to the brink of war, China could of­fer the is­land talks to end their state of hos­til­ity, with a view to get­ting the Tai­wanese to sign a peace agree­ment that would in­clude a pro­vi­sion to re­unify with the main­land even­tu­ally. If Tai­wan re­sists, it would give China the per­fect ex­cuse to use mil­i­tary force.</p>
    <p>“If China and the US do not have diplo­matic re­la­tions, China is no longer obliged to ful­fil its pledge to peace­fully re­unify with Tai­wan,” a source with ties to the Chi­nese lead­er­ship told The Straits Times, re­quest­ing anonymity.</p>
    <p>Washington switched recog­ni­tion from Taipei to Bei­jing in 1979 un­der a “one China” pol­icy, but on con­di­tion that China aban­doned its pol­icy to mil­i­tar­ily “lib­er­ate” Tai­wan and pledged peace­ful re­uni­fi­ca­tion with the self-ruled is­land.</p>
    <p>While the mil­i­tary op­tion may, at first sight, ap­pear at­trac­tive for be­ing a de­ci­sive break from the diplo­matic shadow play, it is any­thing but a clean break with the past. If war broke out and the US went to Tai­wan’s de­fence, the con­flict would be bloody, with no guar­an­tee that China would win. A China of­fen­sive would also in­vite in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions and likely even more in re­tal­i­a­tion from other coun­tries al­lied with the US.</p>
    <p>For many an­a­lysts, a con­ven­tional war be­tween the two nu­clear powers – the US and China – is un­think­able. But even with­out one, the im­pact of eco­nomic war­fare would be dev­as­tat­ing for China.</p>
    <p>And if Amer­ica’s al­lies, Aus­tralia, Canada and Bri­tain, not to men­tion Ja­pan and In­dia, also si­mul­ta­ne­ously recog­nised the ROC, that would be a set­back for China, which has been scor­ing suc­cesses in its ef­forts to diplo­mat­i­cally iso­late Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond sce­nario: China could, af­ter the sev­er­ance of ties with the US, re­sort to a trade war against Tai­wan to force the is­land to its knees. But there would be no win­ners in this war. China and Hong Kong are Tai­wan’s big­gest trad­ing part­ners, ac­count­ing for about 30 per cent of the is­land’s to­tal trade.</p>
    <p>China’s third op­tion: It does not over­re­act – or even does noth­ing – but this would be tan­ta­mount to the end of the sa­cred “one China” pol­icy and a paradigm shift to a “two Chi­nas” pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“Two Chi­nas” is anath­ema to Bei­jing, which has chipped away at Tai­wan’s diplo­matic foot­print ever since it ousted Taipei from the United Na­tions in 1971, tak­ing the China seat.</p>
    <p>THE WARN­ING SIGNS</p>
    <p>Sino-US re­la­tions have been be­dev­illed by a whole range of con­tentious is­sues in re­cent years, from the trade war and Hong Kong to the South China Sea dis­putes and Covid-19. But Tai­wan stands out as a red-line is­sue for China, not to men­tion for Pres­i­dent Xi, who has pub­licly made it a goal to set­tle the mat­ter of re­uni­fi­ca­tion, in­stead of kick­ing it down the road.</p>
    <p>The flip side of China’s re­solve is that there is much less room for ma­noeu­vre.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want a fight, but if the US crosses our red line, we will with­out doubt fight,” a source with ties to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary said in an in­ter­view, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>For many in China, the US is in­creas­ingly push­ing the line on Tai­wan, and Taipei is com­plicit in this.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Alex Azar vis­ited Tai­wan in Au­gust, the most se­nior US of­fi­cial to set foot on the is­land since 1979. The fol­low­ing month, US Un­der Sec­re­tary of State for Eco­nomic Growth, En­ergy, and the En­vi­ron­ment Keith Krach at­tended the me­mo­rial ser­vice for the is­land’s for­mer pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui.</p>
    <p>Last week, Tai­wan’s Par­lia­ment passed two res­o­lu­tions, call­ing for Taipei to re-es­tab­lish diplo­matic re­la­tions with Washington and to seek US mil­i­tary as­sis­tance in the event of con­flict with China. That the res­o­lu­tions were spon­sored by the op­po­si­tion KMT, which es­pouses re­uni­fi­ca­tion and op­poses in­de­pen­dence, is only likely to worsen Chi­nese wor­ries about de­vel­op­ments in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, five Bills sup­port­ing Tai­wan have been sent to or passed by the US Congress.</p>
    <p>“China still seeks co­op­er­a­tion (with the US), but it is pre­pared for a break-up,” said Mr Lu Xiang, an ex­pert on the US at the Chi­nese Academy of So­cial Sciences, a Chi­nese gov­ern­ment think-tank.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China has been busy send­ing warn­ing sig­nals to Tai­wan. In re­cent weeks, its mil­i­tary has con­ducted war games in the air and at sea unusu­ally close to the is­land, and last month, its fighter planes breached an un­of­fi­cial bound­ary in the Tai­wan Strait. “Those who play with fire are bound to get burnt,” was how a Chi­nese de­fence spokesman de­scribed the in­creas­ingly ag­gres­sive mil­i­tary ma­noeu­vres directed at Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Given the cur­rent ten­sions and provo­ca­tions from both sides, an­a­lysts fear the break­ing point may come un­ex­pect­edly.</p>
    <p>For decades, the Tai­wan is­sue has oc­ca­sion­ally roiled US-China re­la­tions and then re­ceded to the back burner. But now, with Sino-US ties at their low­est point and a dis­tracted, pug­na­cious US Pres­i­dent des­per­ately look­ing for a means to avoid go­ing down in de­feat next month, anx­i­ety is grow­ing on both sides of the strait that the chances of a con­flict over Tai­wan are steadily ris­ing. It’s time all par­ties con­cerned heed the warn­ing signs and avoid fur­ther op­por­tu­ni­ties for es­ca­la­tion. Who­ever wins on Nov 3, all will lose should war break out over Tai­wan.</p>
