    <p>tive Alex Hun­gate said the com­pany is step­ping up dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and train­ing its staff. He said this will help to cre­ate new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties and mit­i­gate the de­cline in its avi­a­tion busi­ness.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple of this is its re­cent deal to buy avi­a­tion food so­lu­tions com­pany Monty’s Bake­house, which Sats says will help it to de­velop sus­tain­able, low-touch pack­ag­ing that cus­tomers now need.</p>
    <p>Mr Mus­dal­ifa said dnata will adapt its ex­ist­ing ser­vices and in­tro­duce new ser­vices in re­sponse to the chang­ing land­scape. An op­tion is to di­ver­sify its sup­ply chain into di­rect de­liv­ery of busi­ness-to­busi­ness air cargo after ar­rival, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sia from the AAIS said aero­space com­pa­nies recog­nise that re­ly­ing on govern­ment sup­port is not a long-term so­lu­tion. They have been ex­plor­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, in­no­vat­ing so­lu­tions and ac­cel­er­at­ing their dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes ex­plor­ing merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions to build stronger busi­nesses, or di­ver­si­fy­ing to other sec­tors like un­manned sys­tems.</p>
    <p>He added: “We are look­ing for­ward to the an­nounce­ment of spe­cific mea­sures for sup­port­ing the re­ten­tion of core ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“We are also col­lab­o­rat­ing with govern­ment agen­cies on study­ing and plan­ning for repo­si­tion­ing of the in­dus­try for the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>On the ex­tended sup­port mea­sures, CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said com­pa­nies will still be los­ing more money as long as planes are grounded.</p>
    <p>“So un­for­tu­nately, I sup­pose it may be nec­es­sary to ra­tio­nalise the pay­roll since you are not go­ing to be need­ing as many peo­ple... but at least the mea­sures will help to min­imise the job losses.”</p>
    <p>Two Sin­ga­porean men have been jailed for ar­rang­ing a mar­riage of con­ve­nience be­tween a Sin­ga­porean man and a fe­male Chi­nese na­tional.</p>
    <p>Choo Yong Sheng and Yap Jun­lian, both 38, were con­victed on Aug 4 and Aug 12 re­spec­tively for of­fences un­der the Im­mi­gra­tion Act, said the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity (ICA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both men were sen­tenced to 32 weeks’ jail. Choo has been jailed for an ad­di­tional 12 weeks for hurt­ing po­lice of­fi­cers in a dis­pute un­re­lated to the sham mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Choo and Yap were also fined $3,000 and $2,000 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions by the author­ity re­vealed that in 2015, Choo had of­fered to help Chi­nese na­tional Zhang Fengyu, 42, pro­long her stay in Sin­ga­pore by find­ing her a Sin­ga­porean hus­band.</p>
    <p>Zhang, a long-term visit pass holder un­der the study mama scheme for for­eign women ac­com­pa­ny­ing their chil­dren who study in Sin­ga­pore, wanted to re­main in the Repub­lic after her son com­pleted his ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In re­turn for ar­rang­ing a sham mar­riage for her, Choo asked Zhang for a pay­ment of $18,000 and re­ceived a de­posit of $3,000 from her.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Yap re­cruited Ng Wei Keong Ja­son, a 44-year-old Sin­ga­porean man, as the prospec­tive bride­groom, promis­ing him a re­ward of $8,000.</p>
    <p>After Ng and Zhang solem­nised their mar­riage on July 11, 2016, Zhang paid Yap $10,000. She agreed to pay him an­other $5,000 after she suc­cess­fully be­came a long-term visit pass holder un­der the spon­sor­ship of her Sin­ga­porean spouse.</p>
    <p>ICA of­fi­cers ar­rested Ng and Zhang in March 2017 for en­ter­ing into a mar­riage of con­ve­nience. Ng and Zhang were sen­tenced to jail of six and three months re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>ICA said Choo and Yap were ar­rested by its of­fi­cers in July 2018 and Jan­uary last year re­spec­tively for their in­volve­ment in the sham mar­riage.</p>
    <p>The author­ity added that it takes a se­ri­ous view of in­di­vid­u­als try­ing to cir­cum­vent Sin­ga­pore’s im­mi­gra­tion sys­tem by en­gag­ing in or ar­rang­ing mar­riages of con­ve­nience to ob­tain im­mi­gra­tion fa­cil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>If con­victed, a per­son may be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to 10 years, or both.</p>
