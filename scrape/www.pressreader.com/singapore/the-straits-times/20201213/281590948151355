    <p>NEW YORK • The re­jec­tion came swiftly. The cel­e­bra­tions came just as fast.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court’s un­signed or­der on Fri­day re­ject­ing Texas’ bid to toss the re­sults of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion i n four states won by Mr Joe Bi­den un­cer­e­mo­ni­ously ended a case that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had teased only hours ear­lier as “per­haps the most im­por­tant case in his­tory”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Fri­day’s rul­ing, Mr Trump said on Twit­ter: “The Supreme Court re­ally let us down. No wis­dom, no courage!”</p>
    <p>Com­plain­ing that the court had re­jected the case “in a flash” de­spite his win­ning more votes than any other sit­ting pres­i­dent, Mr Trump wrote: “A rigged elec­tion, fight on!”</p>
    <p>Democrats cheered the rul­ing as a sym­bolic fi­nal blow to more than a month of failed le­gal chal­lenges by Mr Trump and his al­lies.</p>
    <p>“The will of the peo­ple will be heard,” New York At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Leti­tia James, a Demo­crat, said on Twit­ter. Mr Josh Shapiro, the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral of Penn­syl­va­nia and a Demo­crat, said that the Supreme Court had recog­nised the law­suit as a “sedi­tious abuse of the ju­di­cial process”.</p>
    <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the law­mak­ers who signed on to the law­suit “brought dis­hon­our to the House”.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den spokesman said it was “no sur­prise” the high court re­jected “base­less at­tempts” to deny Mr Trump lost the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day night, Sen­a­tor Ben Sasse of Ne­braska was the high­est-level Repub­li­can to break with Mr Trump and many in his own party in ap­plaud­ing the rul­ing.</p>
    <p>“Since elec­tion night, a lot of peo­ple have been con­fus­ing vot­ers by spin­ning Kenyan Birther­type, ‘Chavez rigged the elec­tion from the grave’ con­spir­acy the­o­ries,” Mr Sasse said in a state­ment, “But ev­ery Amer­i­can who cares about the rule of law should take com­fort that the Supreme Court – in­clud­ing all three of Pres­i­dent Trump’s picks – closed the book on this non­sense.”</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court’s rul­ing ef­fec­tively ended the Pres­i­dent’s at­tempts to use the le­gal sys­tem to get a re­sult the vot­ers de­nied him, leav­ing him to press his case in the court of pub­lic opin­ion, where his base­less ar­gu­ments have found far more fer­tile ground.</p>
    <p>A poll re­leased last week by Quin­nip­iac Univer­sity found that more than three-quar­ters of Repub­li­cans be­lieve there was wide­spread fraud in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Rick Hasen, a pro­fes­sor of law at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Irvine, said the court rul­ing, while un­sur­pris­ing, was sig­nif­i­cant for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“The good news is that our in­sti­tu­tions held,” Dr Hasen said.</p>
    <p>“While many Repub­li­can leg­is­la­tors and at­tor­neys-gen­eral signed on to Texas’ anti-demo­cratic ef­fort, Repub­li­can elec­tion of­fi­cials who count the votes and Repub­li­can judges did not.”</p>
    <p>Still, many feared the longert­erm i mpact of Mr Trump’s rhetoric on pub­lic trust in democ­racy and the me­chan­ics of elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Pleased with the SCOTUS rul­ing, but also im­me­di­ately slightly ter­ri­fied of where this crazy train goes next,” Mr Bren­dan Buck, an ad­viser to the last two Repub­li­can Speak­ers, wrote on Twit­ter. SCOTUS refers to the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
    <p>He l ater added: “We should know by now there’s a bot­tom­less sup­ply of crazy.”</p>
    <p>Not long af­ter, Mr Allen West, a for­mer con­gress­man and chair of the Texas Repub­li­can Party, slashed at the Supreme Court and said in a state­ment that hinted at se­ces­sion that “per­haps law-abid­ing states should bond to­gether and form a union of states that will abide by the Con­sti­tu­tion”.</p>
