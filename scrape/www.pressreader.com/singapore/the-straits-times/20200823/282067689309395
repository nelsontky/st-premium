    <p>For two years be­tween 2008 and 2010, all former na­tional pad­dler Is­abelle Li thought about when she woke up every day was the Youth Olympic Games (YOG).</p>
    <p>“All my aca­demics, train­ing and com­pe­ti­tions were planned with the YOG in mind. I was really ob­sessed with it. I spent every mo­ment think­ing about the Games and how to be­come a bet­ter player,” Li, 25, told The Sunday Times.</p>
    <p>After trav­el­ling across four con­ti­nents to com­pete in more than 20 tour­na­ments, her fo­cus and hard work paid off. The teenager be­came one of Sin­ga­pore’s star per­form­ers at the in­au­gu­ral edi­tion, go­ing all the way to the fi­nal in the girls’ sin­gles.</p>
    <p>She even­tu­ally set­tled for the sil­ver medal after a 4-0 loss to Chi­nese top seed Gu Yut­ing.</p>
    <p>But what was most mem­o­rable for Li was the stand­ing ova­tion the 5,000-strong crowd in the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium gave her after the match.</p>
    <p>Li said: “Peo­ple usu­ally say that sil­ver medal­lists are less happy than bronze medal­lists be­cause you lost the fi­nal game. But it was quite dif­fer­ent for me.</p>
    <p>“When I saw my last shot hit the net, yes I was dis­ap­pointed but… one by one, the peo­ple in the crowd got to their feet and started cheer­ing for me like I’d won the game, even though I didn’t.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised there’s beauty in de­feat and I found fam­ily in the crowd be­cause who else would cheer for you in the midst of de­feat?</p>
    <p>“The les­son I had there was that fail­ure is never fi­nal and there’s so much more ahead.”</p>
    <p>Car­ry­ing this sen­ti­ment with her, Li went on to com­pete in the 2011, 2013 and 2015 SEA Games, bag­ging a to­tal of two team golds and two sin­gles sil­vers.</p>
    <p>But a SEA Games sin­gles gold proved elu­sive and, in 2015, she in­jured her knee, re­sult­ing i n a group-stage exit on home ground.</p>
    <p>As she re­cov­ered from the in­jury, Li fo­cused on her stud­ies and, dur­ing that time, re­alised that she wanted to pur­sue other things.</p>
    <p>Her fi­nal out­ing i n na­tional colours was the 2016 World Team Cham­pi­onships in Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>Li said the in­jury was a huge dis­ap­point­ment, and “not go­ing as far as I’d wished in the 2015 SEA Games made it harder” to re­tire as she “wanted to end on a good note”.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to make it seem like I was quit­ting on some­thing but I was at peace with my­self be­cause I knew I was mov­ing on in­stead of quit­ting,” said Li, who en­rolled in Yale-Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Col­lege to study lib­eral arts after the 2015 Games.</p>
    <p>She says her YOG ex­pe­ri­ence will al­ways re­main close to her heart.</p>
    <p>“It helped me feel rooted to Sin­ga­pore and my iden­tity as a Sin­ga­porean be­came stronger,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Lit­tle things like that mo­ti­vate me to want to con­trib­ute to my com­mu­nity and so­ci­ety, so the YOG had a greater im­pact than just within ta­ble ten­nis.”</p>
