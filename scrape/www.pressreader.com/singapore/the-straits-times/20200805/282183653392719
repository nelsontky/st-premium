    <p>A rally in tech stocks in New York spurred lo­cal in­vestors to charge back into the mar­ket yes­ter­day and send lo­cal shares higher.</p>
    <p>The burst of op­ti­mism drove the Straits Times In­dex (STI) up 30.79 points, or 1.24 per cent, to 2,515.70, em­phat­i­cally end­ing a three-day los­ing streak. Gain­ers out­num­bered losers 250 to 184 on trade of 1.42 bil­lion shares worth $1.43 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The main cat­a­lyst came from a rally on Wall Street overnight as in­vestors piled into tech­nol­ogy shares to send the Nas­daq to a record clos­ing high.</p>
    <p>Sen­ti­ment was also boosted by hopes that moves to nail down a coro­n­avirus re­lief Bill would yield fruit and data show­ing that United States man­u­fac­tur­ing ac­tiv­ity last month grew at the fastest pace in more than a year.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal in­vestors took the hint and tar­geted the tech sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tor cap­i­tal equip­ment maker AEM Hold­ings surged 14.48 per cent to $4.19 af­ter it re­ported that earn­ings more than dou­bled in the first half, reach­ing 65 per cent of full-year con­sen­sus es­ti­mates. AEM also raised its in­terim div­i­dend and its sales guid­ance for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>Pre­ci­sion plas­tic com­po­nents maker Sun­ning­dale Tech fin­ished at $1.14, up 9.62 per cent. Sun­right, which pro­vides semi­con­duc­tor test and burn-in ser­vices, rose 9.23 per cent to 35.5 cents.</p>
    <p>UMS, a pri­mary sup­plier in Asia for semi­con­duc­tor equip­ment maker Ap­plied Ma­te­ri­als, added 5 per cent to $1.05.</p>
    <p>CEI Con­tract Man­u­fac­tur­ing ad­vanced 6.43 per cent to 91 cents while Grand Ven­ture Tech­nol­ogy, which has ex­po­sure to the semi­con­duc­tor and life sci­ence in­dus­tries, put on 4 per cent to 26 cents.</p>
    <p>The STI’s gainer was Jar­dine Mathe­son, which closed at US$39.32, up 3.58 per cent.</p>
    <p>There were gains across the re­gion as well. The Hang Seng In­dex rose by 2 per cent, Malaysian shares climbed 0.21 per cent and the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite put on 0.11 per cent, while the Nikkei ad­vanced 1.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The strin­gent lock­down in Vic­to­ria does not seem to have de­terred Aus­tralian in­vestors, who sent the lo­cal mar­ket up 1.9 per cent to a two-week high.</p>
    <p>Tech shares were t he main driver, al­though the na­tion’s Big Four banks helped out as well.</p>
    <p>Swis­squote Bank se­nior an­a­lyst Ipek Ozkardeska­ya noted: “Call it a mar­ket rally, or stock mar­ket in­fla­tion, global eq­uity mar­kets are poised for more gains on hope that more stim­u­lus wi l l sup­port economies, or at least stock prices.”</p>
