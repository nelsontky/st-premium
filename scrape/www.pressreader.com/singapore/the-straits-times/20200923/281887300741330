    <p>HONG KONG • Chi­nese tech gi­ant Ten­cent’s WeChat mes­sag­ing app has seen a surge in down­loads in the United States since Fri­day, af­ter Wash­ing­ton con­firmed it would push ahead with a planned ban of the app, data showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The US Depart­ment of Com­merce is­sued an or­der re­quir­ing Ap­ple and Al­pha­bet’s Google to re­move WeChat for down­loads on na­tional se­cu­rity grounds, but a US judge blocked the move on Sun­day. The US Com­merce Depart­ment said on Mon­day it will chal­lenge the or­der.</p>
    <p>WeChat was in­stalled about 54,000 times be­tween Fri­day and Satur­day, 28 times the 1,900 down­loads seen in the same two-day pe­riod a week be­fore, ac­cord­ing to data an­a­lyt­ics firm Sen­sor Tower.</p>
    <p>It said WeCom, an of­fice col­lab­o­ra­tion app, also saw a jump in down­loads in the US over that pe­riod. The US has launched a series of mea­sures in re­cent months crack­ing down on Chi­nese tech firms and apps, cit­ing na­tional se­cu­rity grounds, as the world’s two largest economies butt heads on is­sues rang­ing from trade and tech­nol­ogy to the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent, which has de­nied its apps pose a na­tional se­cu­rity risk, has said up­dates of the app for ex­ist­ing US users may be neg­a­tively af­fected should Ap­ple and Google re­move WeChat from their stores.</p>
    <p>WeChat is an all-in-one mo­bile app that com­bines mes­sag­ing, so­cial me­dia, pay­ment func­tions and other ser­vices, and boasts more than a bil­lion users glob­ally.</p>
    <p>WeCom was in­stalled 58,000 times in the US on Fri­day and Satur­day, 193 times the 300 down­loads it saw over the same pe­riod a week prior, ac­cord­ing to Sen­sor Tower es­ti­mates. The app was re­branded from Ten­cent’s of­fice col­lab­o­ra­tion app WeChat Work only days af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump first said he would ban WeChat last month.</p>
    <p>Af­ter down­load­ing WeCom, users can now link their WeChat ac­count to it and add t heir WeChat con­tacts, a Reuters test showed. WeCom users can then mes­sage, cre­ate chat groups, and even re­ceive vir­tual money from WeChat friends with­out their WeChat con­tacts hav­ing to down­load WeCom.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent told Chi­nese me­dia WeCom is a com­pletely dif­fer­ent prod­uct from WeChat.</p>
