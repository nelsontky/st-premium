    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob has ap­pointed Mr Tan Kai Hoe as chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross (SRC) coun­cil, the char­ity said in a state­ment yes­ter­day. He took over yes­ter­day from Mr Tee Tua Ba, 78, who has served on the coun­cil for 13 years, and as chair­man for 12 years.</p>
    <p>“The Sin­ga­pore Red Cross ful­fils a crit­i­cal role in meet­ing the so­cial needs in our com­mu­nity. It has been serv­ing the el­derly and dis­abled, up­lift­ing fam­i­lies in need, build­ing com­mu­nity re­silience through blood donor re­cruit­ment and en­cour­ag­ing first-aid learn­ing... With his pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tor ex­pe­ri­ence, I am con­fi­dent that Mr Tan will bring an ad­di­tional di­men­sion to mo­ti­vate more peo­ple to em­brace the hu­man­i­tar­ian mis­sion,” said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah, who is pa­tron of the SRC.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who was a Red Cross youth cadet in sec­ondary school in 1979, served on the SRC coun­cil from 2011 to 2014, as well as from 2016 to the present.</p>
    <p>He was chair­man of over­sight com­mit­tees and vice-chair­man of the SRC from 2017.</p>
    <p>Since 2015, Mr Tan, 54, has been pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Ac­curon Tech­nolo­gies. Ear­lier, he was chief ex­ec­u­tive of for­mer gov­ern­ment agency Spring Sin­ga­pore and an of­fi­cer in the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said: “I am very hon­oured to take over the lead­er­ship role from Mr Tee, some­one whom I re­spect deeply and learnt a lot from over the years.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tee has spear­headed sev­eral in­sti­tu­tional changes. In 2012, he led a re­view of the SRC to stream­line its or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­ture. Mr Tee also di­rected the re-pri­ori­ti­sa­tion of SRC’s lo­cal hu­man­i­tar­ian ser­vices for the most vul­ner­a­ble in the com­mu­nity.</p>
