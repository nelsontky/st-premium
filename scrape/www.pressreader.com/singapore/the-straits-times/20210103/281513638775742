    <p>What started as a curiosity for a 16-year-old, want­ing to be cool and fit in with friends, quickly turned into a full-blown habit. To­day, Chris is a self-con­fessed smok­ing ad­dict.</p>
    <p>That is not his real name and with rea­son: As of two days ago, the full-time na­tional ser­vice­man, now 20, be­came guilty of un­der­age smok­ing.</p>
    <p>On Jan 1 this year, the min­i­mum le­gal age for buy­ing and us­ing to­bacco prod­ucts was raised from 20 to 21, af­ter be­ing in­creased from 18 to 19 in 2019 and then to 20 last year.</p>
    <p>But Chris says his fa­ther, a fel­low smoker, can help him buy a pack of cig­a­rettes any­way. He said: “I can also get older friends to buy for me too. When I re­ally need it, I will find ways to get it.”</p>
    <p>His per­spec­tive, and those of other teenage smok­ers The Sun­day Times spoke to, be­lies the pre­cise in­tent be­hind rais­ing the min­i­mum age: to limit young peo­ple’s ac­cess to to­bacco prod­ucts and to “de­nor­malise” smok­ing, ac­cord­ing to the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>The public health rea­sons are well doc­u­mented.</p>
    <p>In an opin­ion piece for The Straits Times pub­lished on Jan 1, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying and Dr Yvette van der Eijk of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health called for the age limit to be raised fur­ther to 25.</p>
    <p>They noted that one in two smok­ers will die from the habit and pointed out that the dam­age goes be­yond be­ing self-in­flicted. In Sin­ga­pore, over 300 non-smok­ers die each year be­cause of ex­po­sure to se­cond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>The two ex­perts of­fered four other pro­pos­als to plug what they iden­tify as re­main­ing pol­icy gaps in Sin­ga­pore’s to­bacco con­trol regime: rais­ing taxes on to­bacco fur­ther, ban­ning flavours, im­prov­ing quit­ting pro­grammes and more curbs on se­cond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>SHOULD THE MIN­I­MUM AGE BE RAISED FUR­THER?</p>
    <p>Prob­a­bly more than half of Sin­ga­pore­ans were smok­ers in the 1950s, said Pro­fes­sor Chia Kee Seng, the found­ing dean of NUS’ public health school.</p>
    <p>With re­search over the next decades in­creas­ingly link­ing smok­ing to var­i­ous af­flic­tions, pro­hi­bi­tions were in­tro­duced in the 1970s, and in 1993 an age limit of 18 was set.</p>
    <p>In 2017, leg­is­la­tion was passed to pro­gres­sively raise the min­i­mum le­gal age (MLA) to 21 by this year.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo and Dr van der Eijk want to see this roll on to an age limit of 25 in the year 2025 – and per­haps even be­yond, un­til smok­ing is ef­fec­tively ob­so­lete.</p>
    <p>“The in­ten­tion is ac­tu­ally to con­tinue push­ing for the MLA to in­crease in­def­i­nitely,” said Prof Teo, adding that this would be a more re­al­is­tic way for Sin­ga­pore to even­tu­ally be to­bacco-free than to en­force a sud­den, im­me­di­ate ban.</p>
    <p>Prof Chia said: “There is ev­i­dence that the parts of the brain most responsibl­e for de­ci­sion mak­ing, im­pulse con­trol, and peer sus­cep­ti­bil­ity and con­form­ity be­come fully de­vel­oped at about age 25.”</p>
    <p>But not all smok­ing ces­sa­tion ad­vo­cates agree. Dr Ong Kian Chung, a res­pi­ra­tory physi­cian at Mount El­iz­a­beth Hospi­tal, thinks the min­i­mum age should stay at 21.</p>
    <p>“Eighty per cent of smok­ers are known to be hooked by the time they are 21,” he said. “It makes sense... in line with other wellac­cepted tenets of in­de­pen­dence and le­gal age of con­sent.</p>
    <p>“For the young men in Sin­ga­pore, it will also make it less likely they will pick up smok­ing while do­ing na­tional ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gist Paulin Straughan from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity agrees. She said: “It would be hard to jus­tify any lim­i­ta­tion above 21 years, as we gen­er­ally recog­nise that it is the mark that de­fines adult­hood.”</p>
    <p>Chris’ ex­pe­ri­ence un­der­scores how easy it is to get around the min­i­mum age.</p>
    <p>Smoke-free ad­vo­cate Jon Ber­rick, a math­e­mat­ics pro­fes­sor at Yale-NUS Col­lege, con­sid­ers such l aws to be fun­da­men­tally flawed. “(They) send the mis­lead­ing mes­sage that there is a ‘safe’ age for smok­ing and thus down­play the health con­se­quences,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Min­i­mum-age laws make the cig­a­rette ‘a badge of com­ing of age’, a way of seem­ing grown-up, an ef­fec­tive hook for trou­bled ado­les­cents.”</p>
    <p>A smoker who wanted to be known only as CK said this could well be the case.</p>
    <p>“When I picked up smok­ing in sec­ondary school, there was the per­cep­tion that ‘it’s cool be­cause I’m do­ing some­thing adult’,” said the 32-year-old, who works in ad­ver­tis­ing. “I think if you re­move the age limit, fewer un­der­age peo­ple would pick up the habit.”</p>
    <p>Prof Ber­rick says a more ef­fec­tive al­ter­na­tive would be to ban the sale of to­bacco to any­one born from 2000. This would help pre­vent to­bacco use among those not yet ad­dicted and could, over time, elim­i­nate it al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>He came up with this “to­bac­cofree gen­er­a­tion” or “endgame” pro­posal in 2005 and, in 2010, teamed up with Sin­ga­pore med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als to co-author a re­search pa­per on the topic.</p>
    <p>It has been brought up in Par­lia­ment on at least three oc­ca­sions since, but the Health Min­istry said each time that there would be sig­nif­i­cant prac­ti­cal challenges in im­ple­ment­ing such a mea­sure.</p>
    <p>For­mer MP Lee Bee Wah, how­ever, be­lieves such a gen­er­a­tional ap­proach could work. “Many of my res­i­dents used to say they ex­pect to smoke for the rest of their lives, since it’s not easy to quit,” she said. “But many also said they don’t want their chil­dren to smoke.”</p>
    <p>WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE?</p>
    <p>The age re­stric­tion is one of sev­eral mea­sures in the Govern­ment’s arse­nal against smok­ing. Oth­ers in­clude public ed­u­ca­tion, tax­a­tion, ces­sa­tion pro­grammes, point-of­sale dis­play bans and stan­dard­ised pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo and Dr van der Eijk have made the case for fur­ther rais­ing to­bacco taxes. Ex­cise du­ties were last hiked by 10 per cent in 2018, af­ter a sim­i­lar in­crease in 2014. Both times, it led to prices of cig­a­rette packs go­ing up by at least $1.</p>
    <p>Asked if fur­ther in­creases could spark surg­ing con­tra­band ac­tiv­ity, Prof Teo said penal­ties for smug­gling can be stepped up if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>But Dr van der Eijk said this no­tion of levy in­creases lead­ing to a big­ger black mar­ket is a com­mon myth spread by to­bacco com­pa­nies – with their “sub­stan­tial amounts of fi­nan­cial and po­lit­i­cal power” – to de­ter gov­ern­ments from in­creas­ing to­bacco taxes.</p>
    <p>“To­bacco com­pa­nies of­ten gen­er­ate their own data on il­licit trade which usu­ally over­es­ti­mates and ex­ag­ger­ates the fig­ures,” she said.</p>
    <p>In their opin­ion piece, she and Prof Teo wrote: “The World Health</p>
    <p>MP LOUIS NG,</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tion calls to­bacco taxes a ‘best buy’ against chronic dis­eases – a pol­icy mea­sure that is cost­ef­fec­tive to en­act at the pop­u­la­tion level.”</p>
    <p>But more should be done to tar­get not just users of to­bacco, said Prof Ber­rick, who added: “The em­pha­sis of the law should be on the pur­vey­ors of these prod­ucts, just as for other harm­ful ad­dic­tive sub­stances we es­pe­cially tar­get the deal­ers and push­ers.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to The Sun­day Times’ queries, the To­bacco As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, which rep­re­sents the in­dus­try, is­sued a state­ment: “With re­gard to the ef­fi­cacy of var­i­ous new to­bacco con­trol reg­u­la­tions that have been in­tro­duced over the last few years, the (as­so­ci­a­tion) would like to stress that any new poli­cies should be bal­anced, pro­por­tion­ate and backed by science and ev­i­dence.”</p>
    <p>Smok­ers said in­creas­ing prices over the years have had lit­tle to no im­pact on their habit – and that they would not be de­terred by fu­ture spikes.</p>
    <p>MP Louis Ng, a for­mer smoker of 17 years, said: “As a smoker, I would just pay more and do some­thing else less, to con­tinue the habit.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo and Dr van der Eijk pro­posed fol­low­ing Canada, Turkey, Brazil, parts of the United States as well as Euro­pean coun­tries in ban­ning out­right flavours such as men­thol, mint and fruit, which make cig­a­rettes more ap­peal­ing.</p>
    <p>For Dr Ju­lian Hong, a physi­cian at the DTAP Clinic group, en­hanc­ing ces­sa­tion ef­forts is another cru­cial piece of the puzzle.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment is pi­lot­ing sub­sidised nico­tine re­place­ment ther­a­pies (NRT) at public health­care in­sti­tu­tions for el­i­gi­ble par­tic­i­pants. Dr Hong and Dr van der Eijk said this should be made avail­able to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Dr van der Eijk said: “The next step would be to in­clude more op­tions be­yond NRT (such as med­i­ca­tions), in­cor­po­rate coun­selling ser­vices, and see how the pro­gramme can be tai­lored to the in­di­vid­ual’s needs.”</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said em­ploy­ers could pro­vide in­cen­tives for work­ers to quit smok­ing. “The work­place is a pow­er­ful en­vi­ron­ment when it comes to so­cial and be­havioural in­flu­ences in health pro­mo­tion.”</p>
    <p>SHOULD SMOK­ING IN PUBLIC BE BANNED AL­TO­GETHER?</p>
    <p>Shared public spa­ces have also been the fo­cus of the na­tional smoke-free push.</p>
    <p>The list of smok­ing-pro­hib­ited places is grad­u­ally ex­pand­ing, and Prof Teo and Dr van der Eijk said the list could be made even longer.</p>
    <p>Dr van der Eijk added that the lack of reg­u­la­tion in crowded en­ter­tain­ment ar­eas like Clarke Quay and Haji Lane might en­cour­age so­cial smok­ing among young peo­ple who fre­quent these places.</p>
    <p>And se­cond-hand smoke in high-rise res­i­dences is a grow­ing is­sue, with Dr van der Eijk not­ing the sharp in­crease in com­plaints last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, the MP, has called for a ban on smok­ing near win­dows or bal­conies in homes. But in­stead of that, Dr van der Eijk sug­gests mak­ing hous­ing blocks com­pletely smoke-free, with open-air des­ig­nated smok­ing ar­eas set up nearby.</p>
    <p>Fifty of these can be found in the Nee Soon area, thanks to an ini­tia­tive started by the for­mer MP, Ms Lee, who told The Sun­day Times that peo­ple should also be banned from smok­ing while walk­ing.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Sim Ann, who is con­sid­er­ing des­ig­nated smok­ing points in her Bukit Timah ward, said peo­ple are in­creas­ingly vo­cal in their dis­ap­proval of sec­ond­hand smoke. “I can see more pres­sure be­ing brought to bear on smok­ers,” she added.</p>
    <p>That smok­ers should pre­serve the free­dom to light up, how­ever, was not con­tested by most, in­clud­ing non-smok­ers.</p>
    <p>“At 21, they can de­cide for them­selves, know­ing the health risks,” said Mr Ng. “But we need to make sure their habit doesn’t af­fect oth­ers. As long as we can con­trol that el­e­ment, then ev­ery­one has a right to smoke.”</p>
    <p>He spoke from his per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence of de­cid­ing to quit over seven years ago. “Did I en­joy smok­ing? Yes. Do I want my daugh­ters to suf­fer health-wise from the things I find plea­sure in? The an­swer is a firm no.”</p>
    <p>Free­lancer Squid Wan, 35, who kicked the habit last year, said: “We know smok­ing is bad for us, for the peo­ple around us and for the en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>She said she was in­flu­enced by fam­ily mem­bers – her first puff was at 12, with her chain-smok­ing un­cle plac­ing cig­a­rettes in a jar “like candy”.</p>
    <p>Like Chris, the un­der­age smoker, she also thinks that when there is a will, there is a way – in her case, when it came to fi­nally de­cid­ing to quit and go­ing cold turkey.</p>
    <p>“Smok­ing was my com­pan­ion, es­pe­cially in very stress­ful or down pe­ri­ods,” she re­called. “But it was ac­tu­ally mak­ing me feel worse, phys­i­cally and health-wise. It started to feel like self-de­struc­tion – I didn’t like that any­more.</p>
    <p>“Quit­ting was my way of af­firm­ing my self-love.”</p>
    <p>At 21, they can de­cide for them­selves, know­ing the health risks... But we need to make sure their habit doesn’t af­fect oth­ers. As long as we can con­trol that el­e­ment, then ev­ery­one has a right to smoke.</p>
    <p>who quit af­ter be­ing a smoker for 17 years, on the need to pre­serve smok­ers’ free­dom to light up while also pro­tect­ing non-smok­ers from the ill ef­fects of smok­ing.</p>
