    <p>STEPPED-UP MEA­SURES</p>
    <p>For work­ers who come into close con­tact with pas­sen­gers, they should don full PPE. Changi Air­port Group will also step up the fre­quency of clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG (left)</p>
    <p>TAK­ING NEC­ES­SARY PRE­CAU­TIONS</p>
    <p>When we were deal­ing with the spread­ing of the virus in the dor­mi­to­ries and in Sin­ga­pore Expo, we did have work­ers who got in­fected... But very quickly, we went on a tighter regime, took the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions and we saw the last of those in­fec­tions. We have to do the same thing in Changi now.</p>
    <p>MR ONG</p>
    <p>Staff at Changi Air­port who come into close con­tact with pas­sen­gers – such as swab as­sis­tants – will have to don full per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) at work and be tested for Covid-19 ev­ery two weeks.</p>
    <p>About 2,500 air­port work­ers have al­ready been tested for Covid-19 so far since last week, all with neg­a­tive re­sults. An­other 1,000 or so more work­ers will be tested in the com­ing days, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The move comes af­ter two work­ers at Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3 were re­ported last Satur­day to have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>One is a T3 se­cu­rity of­fi­cer who had gone to work be­fore test­ing pos­i­tive. The other is a screener and swab as­sis­tant at Raf­fles Med­i­cal at T3 who had gone to work be­fore test­ing pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The two had not in­ter­acted with each other, and in­ves­ti­ga­tions had not es­tab­lished any link be­tween them, the Min­istry of Health https://str.sg/travel30 (MOH) said last week.</p>
    <p>“As travel vol­ume is ex­pected to pick up in the com­ing months, MOH has been in dis­cus­sion with rel­e­vant agen­cies to ramp up ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of front-line staff work­ing at Changi Air­port,” it said then.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong told The Straits Times that both these work­ers had “come into close con­tact with pas­sen­gers”. Con­tact trac­ing is un­der way</p>
    <p>to iden­tify those deemed to be close con­tacts. While both had worn face masks and gloves, Mr Ong said: “I think that is not enough, so we are go­ing to tighten up the process.”</p>
    <p>He said staff at the air­port will be put on ros­tered rou­tine test­ing sim­i­lar to front-line work­ers and mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>“For work­ers who come into close con­tact with pas­sen­gers, they should don full PPE.</p>
    <p>“Changi Air­port Group will also step up the fre­quency of clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Full PPE in­cludes equip­ment such as gloves, gowns, caps and gog­gles.</p>
    <p>More de­tails about the safety pre­cau­tions are ex­pected to be re­leased in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have tested sev­eral groups of work­ers in re­cent months as part of ef­forts to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, around 11,000 peo­ple work­ing in pub­lic bus de­pots and in­ter­changes were screened for Covid-19 fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of an in­fec­tion clus­ter at Bukit Pan­jang’s trans­port cen­tre. This in­cluded all bus driv­ers as well as em­ploy­ees such as ad­min­is­tra­tive staff.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said the Gov­ern­ment takes the sit­u­a­tion at Changi Air­port very se­ri­ously, and will draw on its ex­pe­ri­ence to ad­dress it.</p>
    <p>“When we were deal­ing with the spread­ing of the virus in the dor­mi­to­ries and in Sin­ga­pore Expo, we did have work­ers who got in­fected,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But very quickly, we went on a tighter regime, took the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions and we saw the last of those in­fec­tions. We have to do the same thing in Changi now.”</p>
