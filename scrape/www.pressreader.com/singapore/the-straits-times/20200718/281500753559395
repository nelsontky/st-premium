    <p>Coro­n­avirus cases in In­dia surged past the one mil­lion mark yes­ter­day, of­fi­cial data showed, as the au­thor­i­ties strug­gled to check the spread of the deadly pan­demic across the world’s sec­ond-most pop­u­lous na­tion.</p>
    <p>It is the third-high­est to­tal in the world, with no sign yet of the in­fec­tion curve flat­ten­ing as new cases emerge in rural ar­eas. More than 25,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>In Brazil, virus cases topped two mil­lion on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>• In­dia hit a mile­stone yes­ter­day morn­ing that it had made great sac­ri­fices to avoid: record­ing more than one mil­lion coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The virus has been gnaw­ing its way across this coun­try of 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple and gain­ing speed, fu­elled by high pop­u­la­tion den­sity, an al­ready be­lea­guered health­care sys­tem and a cal­cu­la­tion by the cen­tral gov­ern­ment to lift a na­tion­wide lock­down in hopes of get­ting the econ­omy up and run­ning, come what may.</p>
    <p>But as In­dia’s num­ber of con­firmed new in­fec­tions keeps hit­ting record highs, many states and cities have been lock­ing down again. In some ar­eas, long lines of bod­ies snake out of cre­ma­tion grounds.</p>
    <p>In­dia is rack­ing up about 30,000 new re­ported in­fec­tions each day – more than any other coun­try ex­cept the United States and Brazil, and it is catch­ing up with Brazil.</p>
    <p>In­dia now has the third-high­est to­tal num­ber of cases – 1,020,644 cases and 25,777 deaths – af­ter the United States and Brazil. Test­ing re­mains sparse, so the real fig­ure could be sig­nif­i­cantly higher.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy es­ti­mate that by the end of next year, In­dia will be the worst-hit coun­try in the world.</p>
    <p>The virus also ap­pears to be spread­ing in In­dian pris­ons, spark­ing out­rage af­ter 80-year-old Maoist ide­alogue and poet Var­avara Rao and peas­ant leader Akhil Go­goi – who is a fa­mous critic of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment and state gov­ern­ment in As­sam – were in­fected while in­car­cer­ated.</p>
    <p>Schools and uni­ver­si­ties have been shut since March with no clear plans to re­open, leav­ing nearly 278 mil­lion stu­dents with­out much to do. More than 100 mil­lion In­di­ans have lost their jobs.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy, which al­ready had been show­ing deep cracks be­fore the pan­demic, is now fore­cast to con­tract by as much as 9.5 per cent in the year that be­gan on April 1.</p>
    <p>In the early days of the pan­demic, Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi took swift ac­tion. He ad­vised mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. At a time when In­dia had fewer than 1,000 known in­fec­tions – al­though the true fig­ure was cer­tainly higher – he im­posed a se­vere na­tion­wide lock­down that would last nearly three months.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of mi­grant labour­ers, who over the years had grav­i­tated to jobs in the cities, sud­denly found them­selves with lit­tle or no work.</p>
    <p>They poured out of the cities and back into the coun­try­side, hop­ing to rely on rel­a­tives in their home vil­lages to sur­vive. In the process, they spread coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions into nearly ev­ery cor­ner of In­dia.</p>
    <p>As the eco­nomic pain re­ally be­gan to bite, Mr Modi changed course. Last month, he urged the lead­ers of In­dia’s 28 states and eight ter­ri­to­ries to “un­lock, un­lock, un­lock”.</p>
    <p>Public health ex­perts say Mr Modi got it back­wards and should have waited un­til the cri­sis was fur­ther along and then im­posed a lock­down.</p>
    <p>The worst-hit ar­eas are In­dia’s big­gest cities, such as Mum­bai, New Delhi, Chen­nai, Ahmed­abad and the tech hub of Ben­galuru.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in In­dia’s north-eastern state of Bi­har im­posed a two-week lock­down be­gin­ning on Thurs­day af­ter a sud­den spike in cases – more than 20,000 in 24 hours. Bi­har is a source of mi­grant labour across In­dia; the surge in Bi­har’s cases cor­re­lates with the re­turn of work­ers from dis­tant cities.</p>
    <p>A sharp rise in cases has also forced a new lock­down in Goa, a state on In­dia’s western coast that is famed for its beaches, just a few weeks af­ter it re­opened to tourists, a life­line to the state econ­omy.</p>
    <p>GLOBAL TO­TAL</p>
    <p>Global Covid-19 cases sur­pass 14m</p>
    <p>The state of Ker­ala, which had been largely suc­cess­ful in con­trol­ling the spread of the virus, also ex­tended lock­down re­stric­tions by a week in its big­gest city, Thiru­vanan­tha­pu­ram, af­ter cases nearly dou­bled in just a few days.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi and top gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials have re­peat­edly said in tele­vised speeches that In­dia is do­ing bet­ter than richer coun­tries, es­pe­cially when it comes to the death rate.</p>
    <p>In­dia has re­ported about 20 virus­re­lated deaths per mil­lion peo­ple, while many other na­tions, in­clud­ing the US, Brazil, Spain and Italy, have all lost hun­dreds per mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think it has any­thing to do with how the gov­ern­ment has han­dled the pan­demic,” said Dr Anand Kr­ish­nan, a pro­fes­sor of epi­demi­ol­ogy at the New Delhi-based All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sciences.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he said, it is be­cause In­dia’s av­er­age pop­u­la­tion age is younger than that of other coun­tries, and obe­sity and di­a­betes, which in­crease peo­ple’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity to the virus, are less preva­lent here.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Zy­dus Cadila plans to com­plete late-stage tri­als for its coro­n­avirus vac­cine can­di­date by next Fe­bru­ary or March and could pro­duce up to 100 mil­lion doses a year ini­tially if it is suc­cess­ful, the com­pany chair­man said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at about seven or a lit­tle more than seven months for the vac­cine, pro­vided the data is en­cour­ag­ing and the vac­cine is proven to be ef­fec­tive dur­ing the tri­als,” chair­man Pankaj Pa­tel said in an in­ter­view.</p>
