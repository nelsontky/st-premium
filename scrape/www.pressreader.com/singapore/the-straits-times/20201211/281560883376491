    <p>With over­seas travel cur­tailed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, par­ents are send­ing their rest­less chil­dren to a host of hol­i­day out­door ac­tiv­i­ties and sports pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>While many providers have ex­panded their of­fer­ings to meet in­creased de­mand, there are also those who can­not do so ow­ing to safe dis­tanc­ing rules and a cap on venue num­bers.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic hit, Raoushan Shahir Ruhul had been look­ing for­ward to vis­it­ing Swe­den for a floor­ball camp and tour­na­ment with the Youth Floor­ball Academy (YFA) this month.</p>
    <p>The academy has had a part­ner­ship with Swedish Su­per League cham­pi­ons Storvreta IBK since Oc­to­ber last year and was set for a two-week train­ing stint in Upp­sala, which in­cluded com­pet­ing in the Storvreta Cup.</p>
    <p>Raoushan’s fa­ther Mo­hammed Ruhul Is­lam had also planned for the trip to be their an­nual year-end va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>But with travel re­stric­tions in place, the 12-year-old has in­stead kept him­self oc­cu­pied with weekly floor­ball classes and a three-day camp with the YFA at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “I felt very sad and dis­ap­pointed be­cause I was ex­cited about the trip.</p>
    <p>“On one hand, I’m sat­is­fied with the cur­rent ac­tiv­i­ties, but it would’ve been a greater year if my whole fam­ily could have ended it off with a hol­i­day over­seas.”</p>
    <p>With fam­i­lies un­able to travel abroad dur­ing the year-end hol­i­days, par­ents have been turn­ing to sports to help keep their chil­dren en­ter­tained and en­gaged.</p>
    <p>Mother of three Ser­ena Tai, who signed her kids up for archery and bas­ket­ball pro­grammes un­der Ac­tiveSG and the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub, said the ac­tiv­i­ties are another way for them to learn new skills.</p>
    <p>“Trav­el­ling is a source of self-dis­cov­ery. Go­ing to new places gives the chil­dren ex­po­sure to dif­fer­ent cul­tures, food and life skills,” said the 41-year-old.</p>
    <p>“But these sports pro­grammes are good too be­cause they boost self-con­fi­dence and sit­u­a­tional aware­ness. They also teach the chil­dren mo­ti­va­tion and team­work. When you ac­quire ex­pe­ri­ence through fun, it gives things a dif­fer­ent di­men­sion.”</p>
    <p>These pro­grammes also pro­vide more op­por­tu­ni­ties for fam­ily bond­ing, said fa­ther of two Tommy Sim, who en­rolled his sons in the Sports Hub’s Sports Devel­op­ment Se­ries so they could learn to cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“I don’t re­ally know how to teach them cy­cling so this is a good pro­gramme and after the sec­ond class, they could even go through an ob­sta­cle course,” said Sim, who plans to take his sons cy­cling at Gar­dens by the Bay.</p>
    <p>“It’s good that they’re oc­cu­pied by this, rather than them sit­ting around at home. This way, they get to work out and learn new skills. It’s also a good op­por­tu­nity for them to make new friends.”</p>
    <p>The i ncrease i n de­mand for sports pro­gram­ming has prompted some acad­e­mies to open ad­di­tional ses­sions for stu­dent-ath­letes. One ex­am­ple is the YFA, which now has six classes on week­ends, up from four, and three hol­i­day camps in­stead of just one.</p>
    <p>YFA chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer No­rani Zaini, 38, said the ex­pan­sion was to cater to in­creased de­mand while still im­ple­ment­ing safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. Each ses­sion can take up to 30 students who are then split into groups of five with no in­ter-min­gling al­lowed.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that the academy gained 30 to 40 more students since the school hol­i­days started last month.</p>
    <p>“I also hope that with more peo­ple com­ing and show­ing in­ter­est in floor­ball, it will grow the com­mu­nity and the younger ones will pick up the sport,” he added.</p>
    <p>Like the YFA, the Ac­tiveSG Hockey Academy started two new pro­grammes, the Year End Ac­tive Hol­i­day pro­gramme for Un­der-12 and U-16 play­ers and the Ac­tive Fam­ily Se­ries (Dec 4 and Dec 11) for par­ent and child.</p>
    <p>These are in ad­di­tion to the Acad­e­mies & Clubs School Hol­i­day Pro­gramme, which has three ses­sions each at two lo­ca­tions this month, up from two each last year. More than 2,000 par­tic­i­pants signed up for the 112 Ac­tiveSG Acad­e­mies & Clubs pro­grammes this year, al­most dou­ble last year’s fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Coach Su­nil Prasad, 48, said the par­ent-child camps are a good way for fam­i­lies to con­nect be­cause “they have to com­mu­ni­cate with each other on the court dur­ing the drills and mini chal­lenges”.</p>
    <p>“When they’re tired, they have to en­cour­age each other too,” he added.</p>
    <p>Last year’s pro­gramme saw only 20 students per ses­sion but this year’s classes at Sengkang have 40 students while those at the Hockey Vil­lage in Boon Lay have 25.</p>
    <p>The Sports Hub has also i ncreased its ac­tiv­ity of­fer­ings this year. Wendy Tan, as­sis­tant gen­eral man­ager of mar­ket­ing and com­mer­cial at Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub, noted that its Com­mu­nity Play Day was ex­panded from be­ing held over one week­end to across 20 days to al­low more peo­ple to par­tic­i­pate while main­tain­ing the nec­es­sary safety man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>How­ever, not all in­dus­try play­ers have been able to meet the in­creased de­mand.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for foot­ball academy JSSL Sin­ga­pore said that it has not been able to ac­com­mo­date the in­crease in sign-ups be­cause of re­stric­tions on venue num­bers.</p>
    <p>It is op­er­at­ing un­der ca­pac­ity with the same num­ber of camps be­cause of safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions. It has six foot­ball camps for play­ers of dif­fer­ent lev­els with a cap of 50 students per camp.</p>
    <p>Sum­ming up the Covid-dis­rupted hol­i­days, Ruhul, who usu­ally takes the fam­ily of four on year-end trips for two weeks, said: “It’s (the camp) not a per­fect sub­sti­tute, but it’s a fair-enough one to keep him oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>“With Covid-19 and be­ing un­able to travel, there’s no stress re­liever but at least he still gets to at­tend floor­ball camps and train­ing. When­ever he goes, he’s happy and that makes me happy also.”</p>
    <p>GOOD AL­TER­NA­TIVE</p>
    <p>Trav­el­ling is a source of self-dis­cov­ery... But these sports pro­grammes are good too be­cause they boost self-con­fi­dence and sit­u­a­tional aware­ness.</p>
