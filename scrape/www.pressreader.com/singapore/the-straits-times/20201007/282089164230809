    <p>The col­lapse of a ven­ti­la­tion duct in a Nex mall cin­ema was most likely due to wa­ter­logged in­su­la­tion ma­te­rial whose weight had over­loaded the duct’s sup­port­ing brack­ets, ac­cord­ing to the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity’s (BCA) pre­lim­i­nary find­ings.</p>
    <p>The Aug 30 in­ci­dent, which oc­curred in a Shaw The­atres cin­ema hall, left two movie­go­ers in­jured.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing and are ex­pected to be com­pleted by end-Oc­to­ber, said the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) in a writ­ten re­ply on Mon­day to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion from Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas).</p>
    <p>BCA had found that “a sig­nif­i­cant amount of wa­ter had ac­cu­mu­lated in the layer of acous­tic ma­te­rial sur­round­ing the air-con­di­tion­ing and me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion (ACMV) duct”.</p>
    <p>The added weight had most likely caused the brack­ets hold­ing the duct to give way.</p>
    <p>The acous­tic ma­te­rial sur­round­ing the duct serves to reg­u­late the sur­face tem­per­a­ture around the duct to pre­vent wa­ter from form­ing due to con­den­sa­tion, and to in­su­late the noise caused by air trav­el­ling through the duct.</p>
    <p>BCA has alerted other cin­ema op­er­a­tors to in­spect their ACMV ducts and carry out main­te­nance and re­pair works where nec­es­sary, MND added.</p>
    <p>BCA will also as­sess what fur­ther mea­sures need to be taken to pre­vent a re­cur­rence of such in­ci­dents, af­ter it has com­pleted its in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Daniel Wong of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s School of De­sign and En­vi­ron­ment said the wa­ter ac­cu­mu­la­tion could come from a leak­ing wa­ter pipe, a wa­ter­proof­ing de­fect al­low­ing the ingress of wa­ter, or pro­longed con­den­sa­tion due to tem­per­a­ture changes.</p>
    <p>He noted that these oc­cur­rences are com­mon in poorly main­tained or aban­doned build­ings.</p>
    <p>Prof Wong stressed that to pre­vent such fail­ures, sched­uled in­spec­tions and reg­u­lar main­te­nance must be car­ried out.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, a spokesman from Nex said it is pro­vid­ing as­sis­tance to its ten­ant, Shaw The­atres, to carry out rec­ti­fi­ca­tion works.</p>
    <p>The mall, which is owned and man­aged by Gold Ridge, said it will “con­tinue to col­lab­o­rate with the reg­u­la­tory bod­ies to en­sure that this is re­solved as soon as pos­si­ble and pre­ven­tive mea­sures are put in place”.</p>
    <p>Nex de­clined to say if it is check­ing other ACMV ducts in the build­ing for sim­i­lar is­sues.</p>
    <p>Build­ing own­ers are re­spon­si­ble by law for the main­te­nance of their build­ings, in­clud­ing in­te­rior fix­tures.</p>
    <p>Shaw The­atres said it con­ducted in­spec­tions at its six cine­plexes, fol­low­ing the in­ci­dent as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, and all were found to be safe.</p>
    <p>Golden Vil­lage (GV) cin­e­mas said that it con­ducted a round of in­spec­tion and main­te­nance checks with BCA of­fi­cers, af­ter rec­om­men­da­tions from the author­ity. This was on top of its sched­uled main­te­nance and in­spec­tions.</p>
    <p>A GV spokesman added that the cin­e­mas’ air-con­di­tion­ing ducts are de­signed to be po­si­tioned away from the seat­ing zones.</p>
