    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong has hailed blended sport­ing events that in­cor­po­rate vir­tual and phys­i­cal el­e­ments, and noted the busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties they can pro­vide the Sin­ga­pore sports in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>He was among the 16 guests and celebri­ties in the Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon’s (SCSM) Race As One live show yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It fea­tured el­e­ments of SCSM’s Grand Fi­nale Cel­e­bra­tion Ex­pe­ri­ence at Gar­dens by the Bay and guests, in­clud­ing Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin and Mr Tong, ran a half-marathon re­lay for the SCSM 2020 Char­ity Chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>The 19th edi­tion of the SCSM, which runs till to­day, in­cor­po­rates a vir­tual race and fea­tures aug­mented re­al­ity (AR) for the first time. The an­nual SCSM tra­di­tion­ally at­tracts over 50,000 run­ners every year. About 50 per cent were for­eign­ers last year.</p>
    <p>As at Dec 3, this year’s SCSM Grand Fi­nale hy­brid race saw over 4,000 for­eign run­ners tak­ing part, 35 per cent of to­tal sign-ups.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong ac­knowl­edged that the dif­fer­ent for­mat was brought about by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has changed the way sports events are or­gan­ised. Through tech­nol­ogy, we can... (give) par­tic­i­pants a more en­gag­ing and in­ter­ac­tive ex­pe­ri­ence within safety guide­lines,” he said in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies can pro­vide real-time feed­back to par­tic­i­pants, com­ple­ment­ing so­cial and en­ter­tain­ment el­e­ments of a sport­ing ac­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>He hopes blended sports projects in Sin­ga­pore can gain re­gional or in­ter­na­tional trac­tion and help con­trib­ute to a more vi­brant sports sec­tor here amid the chal­lenges of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Grand Fi­nale Cel­e­bra­tion Ex­pe­ri­ence also saw run­ners start to col­lect their race en­ti­tle­ments.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants had to pre-reg­is­ter for one of 32 half-hour time slots over the week­end. Only 25 peo­ple were al­lowed in the Flower Field Hall per ses­sion. Other safety mea­sures such as tem­per­a­ture tak­ing were in place.</p>
    <p>De­spite the dif­fer­ent for­mat, run­ners were ex­cited to col­lect their goodie bags and pose for photos.</p>
    <p>Yue Chin Beng, who signed up for the Rouvy VR 10km with his friend Lau Hock Bee, liked that they could pose at a back­drop of the fin­ish­ing line this year.</p>
    <p>While he could not run in a crowd and pace him­self against other run­ners this year, Yue, 60, was happy to have a “buddy run” with Lau, 61, as the two tack­led the 10km dis­tance to­gether at East Coast Park. Lau liked the con­ve­nience of choos­ing when and where he could com­plete this year’s run.</p>
    <p>Ong Ling Lee, direc­tor of sports at Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), said this hy­brid and im­mer­sive for­mat for events is here to stay.</p>
    <p>“For now, vir­tual for­mats al­low vis­i­tors to have a taste of what they hope to see dur­ing an event and when they even­tu­ally travel,” she said. “How­ever, it will not fully re­place the ex­cite­ment that comes with ex­pe­ri­enc­ing an event phys­i­cally. As such, we hope to be able to wel­come vis­i­tors in per­son for our sport­ing events in Sin­ga­pore when the time is right.”</p>
    <p>On the pos­si­bil­ity of the re­turn of more mar­quee events and more spec­ta­tors next year, she said: “STB has cu­rated a vi­brant cal­en­dar of world-class sport­ing events over the years, and we look for­ward to wel­com­ing sports fans back to ex­pe­ri­ence Sin­ga­pore’s in­no­va­tive and ex­cep­tional events when the time is right.”</p>
    <p>This fol­lows the re­sump­tion of live sport­ing events here. Mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion One Cham­pi­onship’s last two events al­lowed 250 spec­ta­tors, while 200 fans were let into Our Tampines Hub for the SPL sea­son fi­nale be­tween Tampines Rovers and Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong added that the au­thor­i­ties are work­ing on bring­ing back more events for Sin­ga­pore­ans too.</p>
    <p>“As many Sin­ga­pore­ans are ea­ger to par­tic­i­pate and en­joy sports events, we are work­ing to­wards re­sum­ing more large-scale events in a safe man­ner,” he said.</p>
