    <p>Viet­nam an­nounced yes­ter­day that all do­mes­tic pas­sen­ger flights to and from Danang will be sus­pended for 15 days. At least 22 Covid-19 cases have been de­tected in or around the city since last Satur­day. All bus and train services to and from Danang have also been sus­pended from yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>HANOI • Viet­nam has sus­pended all flights to and from Danang for 15 days af­ter at l east 22 cases of Covid-19 were de­tected in the city, the gov­ern­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The South-east Asian coun­try is back on high alert af­ter the au­thor­i­ties last Satur­day con­firmed the first com­mu­nity in­fec­tions since April, and an­other three cases on Sun­day, all in or around Danang.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther 11 cases linked to a</p>
    <p>Danang hospi­tal were re­ported late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Viet­nam’s Health Min­istry re­ported seven cases in Danang and the sur­round­ing prov­ince. All bus and train services to and from Danang have also been sus­pended from yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coastal city, a tourism hot spot, had rein­tro­duced so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures over the week­end af­ter the gov­ern­ment con­firmed the first do­mes­ti­cally-trans­mit­ted cases of the coro­n­avirus in more than three months.</p>
    <p>With more than 95 mil­lion peo­ple, Viet­nam is the most pop­u­lous coun­try in the world to have recorded no Covid-19 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Thanks to strict quar­an­tine mea­sures and an ag­gres­sive and wide­spread test­ing pro­gramme, Viet­nam has kept its virus to­tal to 438 cases.</p>
    <p>Two of the Danang cases were in a crit­i­cal con­di­tion, the Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam is still closed to for­eign tourism, but there had been a surge in do­mes­tic trav­ellers look­ing to take ad­van­tage of dis­counted flights and hol­i­day pack­ages to lo­cal re­sorts.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the gov­ern­ment said it had re­quested the Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Viet­nam (CAAV) to al­low do­mes­tic air­lines to sig­nif­i­cantly in­crease the num­ber of flights from Danang to 11 other Viet­namese cities in or­der to help evac­u­ate 80,000 peo­ple, mostly tourists.</p>
    <p>“All evac­u­a­tion flights are now can­celled,” CAAV deputy di­rec­tor Vo Huy Cuong told Reuters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We op­er­ated 90 flights to evac­u­ate tourists stranded in Danang yes­ter­day but most tourists had al­ready left Danang on Sun­day, mostly by coach or train to nearby prov­inces,” Mr Cuong said.</p>
    <p>Around 18,000 of the tourists who had been in Danang have re­turned to Ho Chi Minh City, the au­thor­i­ties from the south­ern busi­ness hub said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A fur­ther 15,000 to 20,000 had been ex­pected to ar­rive in Hanoi, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from the city’s gov­ern­ing body on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s first case since April 16 was per­haps the most un­nerv­ing: a 57-year-old grand­fa­ther who had been in Danang for about a month and had not trav­elled to other prov­inces.</p>
    <p>That has trig­gered con­cerns that Viet­nam, which has re­ported rel­a­tively low in­fec­tion num­bers over­all, may be vul­ner­a­ble to im­ported cases from peo­ple cross­ing the bor­der il­le­gally into the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc has or­dered tighter bor­der and im­mi­gra­tion con­trols.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have made a num­ber of ar­rests of Viet­namese and Chi­nese charged with shep­herd­ing peo­ple into the coun­try il­le­gally.</p>
    <p>Still, Viet­namese health of­fi­cials, like their coun­ter­parts else­where, are puz­zling over the source of new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>So Viet­namese lead­ers are do­ing what has suc­ceeded in the past: de­ploy­ing swift and blunt lock­down­like ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Danang’s au­thor­i­ties shut down two hos­pi­tals vis­ited by two vic­tims, and also or­dered pa­tients, med­i­cal staff, care­givers and fam­ily mem­bers – about 7,000 peo­ple in to­tal – to be quar­an­tined for 14 days, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>A third hospi­tal was also locked down, VnEx­press re­ported.</p>
    <p>The city is­sued a stay-at-home or­der for 15 days for six of eight dis­tricts start­ing yes­ter­day, the lo­cal gov­ern­ment said on its web­site.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents are pro­hib­ited from go­ing out ex­cept for es­sen­tial rea­sons like buy­ing food and medicine, for health emer­gen­cies or work­ing at fac­to­ries. They must also stay 2m apart from one an­other.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, oper­a­tions of private ve­hi­cles are re­stricted.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other parts of the coun­try are tak­ing pre­cau­tions. In Hanoi, some 790km to the north of Danang, of­fi­cials reis­sued an­tivirus man­dates – in­clud­ing wear­ing masks in public ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Danang’s au­thor­i­ties shut down two hos­pi­tals vis­ited by two virus cases, and also or­dered pa­tients, med­i­cal staff, care­givers and fam­ily mem­bers – about 7,000 peo­ple in to­tal – to be quar­an­tined for 14 days, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
