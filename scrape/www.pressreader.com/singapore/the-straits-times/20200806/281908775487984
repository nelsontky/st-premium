    <p>COLOMBO • Sri Lankans shrugged off fears of the coron­avirus and streamed into polling cen­tres yes­ter­day to elect a new Par­lia­ment that Pres­i­dent Gotabaya Ra­japaksa hopes will clear the way for him to boost his pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The tourism-de­pen­dent is­land na­tion of 21 mil­lion peo­ple has been strug­gling since deadly Is­lamist mil­i­tant at­tacks on ho­tels and churches last year, fol­lowed by lock­downs to slow the spread of the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­japaksa is seek­ing a twothirds ma­jor­ity for his party in the 225-seat Par­lia­ment to en­able con­sti­tu­tional re­forms to make the pres­i­dency more pow­er­ful, so he can im­ple­ment his eco­nomic and na­tional se­cu­rity agenda.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers, who wore masks and kept 1m apart, seemed keen to have their say with a third of the elec­torate cast­ing bal­lots in the first four hours, the Elec­tion Com­mis­sion said.</p>
    <p>“If they come at this rate we should get be­tween 65 and 70 per cent, which is good given the Covid-19 si­t­u­a­tion,” said top Elec­tion Com­mis­sion of­fi­cial Sa­man Sri Rath­nayake.</p>
    <p>Sri Lanka re­ported 2,828 cases of the coron­avirus and 11 deaths as of Tues­day, which is low com­pared with other South Asian coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Elec­tion of­fi­cials wore trans­par­ent face shields, while med­i­cal per­son­nel were de­ployed to en­sure that vot­ers abided by rules to pre­vent the spread of the coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>“The polling sta­tion is safer than the beach, the res­tau­rant and the mar­ket­place,” said Elec­tion Com­mis­sion chair Mahinda De­shapriya.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­japaksa won the pres­i­dency last Novem­ber vow­ing to re­store re­la­tions with China, which had been strained by dis­putes over some Chi­nese in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>He is hop­ing to in­stall his older brother Mahinda Ra­japaksa, who is a former pres­i­dent, as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The broth­ers built their po­lit­i­cal ca­reers as na­tion­al­ist cham­pi­ons of the ma­jor­ity Sin­halese Bud­dhist com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>They are best known for crush­ing eth­nic mi­nor­ity Tamil sep­a­ratist in­sur­gents who bat­tled for decades for a home­land in the is­land’s north and east.</p>
    <p>The 26-year civil war ended in 2009 when the el­der Ra­japaksa was pres­i­dent amid al­le­ga­tions of tor­ture and killings of civil­ians in the fi­nal stages of the con­flict.</p>
    <p>Since then, gov­ern­ments led by the broth­ers’ op­po­nents have sought to re­duce the power of the pres­i­dent to pre­vent abuses and in­stead strengthen in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sions ap­pointed by Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>But Mr Gotabaya Ra­japaksa said he has felt hob­bled since he took over as pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“I need power to im­ple­ment my eco­nomic pro­gramme which you voted for,” he told sup­port­ers last week.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion led by Mr Sa­jith Pre­madasa, son of as­sas­si­nated pres­i­dent Ranas­inghe Pre­madasa, has warned of the risk of au­toc­racy if the pres­i­dency is in­vested with more pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Votes are to be counted to­day and the re­sults should be known later the same day.</p>
    <p>AS SAFE AS IT GETS</p>
    <p>The polling sta­tion is safer than the beach, the res­tau­rant and the mar­ket­place. ’’</p>
