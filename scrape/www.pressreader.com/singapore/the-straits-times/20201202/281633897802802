    <p>MANILA • Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte said par­tial coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions will re­main in the cap­i­tal re­gion un­til the end of the year, with the gov­ern­ment urg­ing Filipinos to limit Christ­mas gath­er­ings to pre­vent a post-hol­i­day surge in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must still wear masks and face shields and ob­serve so­cial dis­tanc­ing in Metro Manila as well as in Mr Duterte’s home town, Davao, and six other ar­eas for the whole of this month, while less strin­gent re­stric­tions will be en­forced for the rest of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In a late-night tele­vised ad­dress on Mon­day, Mr Duterte re­minded Filipinos of the dan­ger of ig­nor­ing safety pro­to­cols, cit­ing what he said was a third wave of in­fec­tions in Europe and the United States.</p>
    <p>He blamed the resur­gence in those coun­tries on the stub­born­ness of some peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In the Philip­pines, cases con­tin­ued to rise af­ter re­stric­tions were re­laxed, which Mr Duterte said was nec­es­sary be­cause peo­ple needed to earn a liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal chief ex­ec­u­tives and med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers warned that fur­ther loos­en­ing of curbs would put the cap­i­tal re­gion, which ac­counts for a third of the econ­omy, at risk dur­ing the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, which has the se­cond-high­est num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions and deaths in South-east Asia behind In­done­sia, has recorded more than 430,000 con­firmed cases and more than 8,300 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Fran­cisco Duque asked Filipinos to limit Christ­mas gath­er­ings to im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers as he warned against com­pla­cency and ig­nor­ing health stan­dards.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Sec­re­tary Ed­uardo Ano said Christ­mas par­ties, fam­ily re­unions and carol singing out­side homes are con­sid­ered pro­hib­ited mass gath­er­ings, but mi­nors will be al­lowed to go to malls if they are ac­com­pa­nied by their par­ents.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Viet­namese Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc or­dered the coun­try’s avi­a­tion author­ity to halt in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial flights af­ter the na­tion re­ported its first lo­cal coro­n­avirus cases in al­most three months, ac­cord­ing to a post­ing on the gov­ern­ment’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The Premier, who said “res­cue” flights bring­ing Viet­namese home from abroad should con­tinue, in­structed the Ho Chi Minh City gov­ern­ment to quickly trace and iso­late ev­ery­one who had come into con­tact with those who had tested pos­i­tive.</p>
