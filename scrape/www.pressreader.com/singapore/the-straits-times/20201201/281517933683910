    <p>As the tran­si­tion of United States pres­i­den­tial power moves into higher gear this week and Mr Don­ald Trump grudg­ingly sig­nals that he won’t re­main in of­fice af­ter Jan­uary, the im­pend­ing ar­rival in the White House of</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den and his team is be­ing hailed by com­men­ta­tors as sig­ni­fy­ing more than just a change of gov­ern­ment in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>For it is also seen as mark­ing a broader de­feat of pop­ulist lead­ers around the world, a mor­tal blow to all those who, like Mr Trump, have risen to power by smash­ing decades, if not cen­turies, of “re­spectable” political de­bate and norms with sim­plis­tic anti-es­tab­lish­ment ap­peals to the “low­est in­stincts” of their elec­torates.</p>
    <p>With Mr Trump now on his way out, the age of pop­ulist lead­ers is al­legedly end­ing. “The grown-ups are back in con­trol,” gushed a re­cent edi­to­rial in Lon­don’s Fi­nan­cial Times news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>The be­lief that Mr Trump and his fol­low­ers were mere aber­ra­tions, flukes which are now about to be con­signed to the scrapheap of his­tory, is also re­in­forced by Amer­ica’s Pres­i­dent-elect. Mr Trump, claimed Mr Bi­den re­peat­edly, “is not who we are”.</p>
    <p>By im­pli­ca­tion, there­fore, Pres­i­dent Trump’s de­par­ture is a re­turn to the pre­dictable past, an in­di­ca­tion that pop­ulism has had its day: been there, done that, never bought the T-shirt.</p>
    <p>Well, if only mat­ters were so sim­ple. Quite apart from the fact that there is no clear, use­ful def­i­ni­tion of what con­sti­tutes a pop­ulist leader, the do­mes­tic pol­i­tics of in­di­vid­ual na­tions are so di­verse that it is sim­ply im­pos­si­ble to sug­gest that the de­feat of one Amer­i­can leader who claimed to lead the peo­ple’s re­volt against the elites is now likely to be fol­lowed by the de­feat of sim­i­lar lead­ers in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it is pre­cisely the use of such sim­plis­tic one-size-fits-all analo­gies that makes the de­feat of such anti-es­tab­lish­ment re­bel­lions less likely. For if main­stream, es­tab­lished politi­cians per­sist in be­liev­ing that pop­ulism is just like a skin rash which ap­pears out of nowhere but also dis­ap­pears with­out ex­pla­na­tion, then they are head­ing for se­ri­ous trou­ble.</p>
    <p>LIKE PORNOG­RA­PHY</p>
    <p>Pop­ulism is one of the most over­worked con­cepts in the political lex­i­con; to para­phrase a judge of the US Supreme Court who tried to de­fine pornog­ra­phy dur­ing the 1960s, the best way of defin­ing it is prob­a­bly by ac­cept­ing that “you know it when you see it”.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, a num­ber of lead­ers around the world are fre­quently as­so­ci­ated with the pop­ulist move­ment. They in­clude Mr Naren­dra Modi in In­dia; Mr Boris John­son in Britain; Mr Jair Bol­sonaro, the Pres­i­dent of Brazil; Mr Vik­tor Or­ban, the Hun­gar­ian Prime Min­is­ter; Mr Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan, the Pres­i­dent of Tur­key; Mr Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu, the Is­raeli Premier; Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin; and Mr Jaroslaw Kaczyn­ski, who runs Poland.</p>
    <p>Un­ques­tion­ably, this dis­parate col­lec­tion of lead­ers span­ning var­i­ous con­ti­nents do have a few things in com­mon.</p>
    <p>All came to power by pack­ag­ing them­selves as the cham­pi­ons of the dis­pos­sessed, de­ter­mined to con­front priv­i­leged elites who, they claimed, were un­in­ter­ested in the fate of or­di­nary peo­ple.</p>
    <p>All promised not merely to im­prove gov­er­nance, but also to rein­vent their states, based on mean­ing­less slo­gans such as “out with the old” or “drain the swamp”.</p>
    <p>All re­sort to un­usual meth­ods of political con­trol, from the clever ex­ploita­tion of es­tab­lished me­dia plat­forms such as pri­vate TV chan­nels to the more novel com­mu­ni­ca­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties of Twit­ter or Face­book, with the ob­jec­tive of not only de­feat­ing their op­po­nents, but of de­mon­is­ing them out of ex­is­tence. Op­po­nents are of­ten dis­missed as ei­ther traitors or as sim­ply men­tally un­suit­able.</p>
    <p>And all th­ese lead­ers seem de­ter­mined to cling to power by us­ing ev­ery avail­able ex­tra-le­gal ruse. Pres­i­dent Trump re­cently ex­plored the pos­si­bil­ity of sim­ply can­celling the elec­toral out­comes in cer­tain Amer­i­can states be­cause he did not like the re­sults.</p>
    <p>He failed in this en­deav­our, but Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Er­do­gan did ex­actly that when con­fronted with bad lo­cal elec­toral re­sults re­cently, while Hun­gar­ian Prime Min­is­ter Or­ban went fur­ther by mak­ing sure that elected op­po­si­tion lead­ers were sim­ply stripped of their func­tions, so they were al­lowed to be in of­fice, but not in power.</p>
    <p>HUGE DIF­FER­ENCES</p>
    <p>Yet just be­cause there are cer­tain sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween th­ese lead­ers should not ob­scure the fact that the con­cept of “pop­ulism” does noth­ing to en­lighten us.</p>
    <p>To start with, there are huge dif­fer­ences be­tween the pow­ers which each leader in this sup­posed group holds, re­gard­less of how in­clined they may be to sub­vert es­tab­lished con­sti­tu­tional norms.</p>
    <p>The Turk­ish Pres­i­dent, for in­stance, sim­ply dis­carded a Con­sti­tu­tion he did not like and drafted one to suit him. But, how­ever much one wishes to ac­cuse Mr Trump of ig­nor­ing the pro­vi­sions of the US Con­sti­tu­tion, the fact re­mains that he could do noth­ing to post­pone the elec­tions, noth­ing to per­suade a hos­tile US Congress to au­tho­rise spend­ing and noth­ing to seize pow­ers from in­di­vid­ual Amer­i­can states dur­ing the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Lump­ing all th­ese lead­ers to­gether does not, there­fore, make much sense.</p>
    <p>There are also dif­fer­ences in time­lines. The Hun­gar­ian, Is­raeli and In­dian prime min­is­ters – all re­ferred to as pop­ulists – have ruled their coun­tries well be­fore any­one even thought of spec­u­lat­ing about Mr Trump’s political am­bi­tions in the US.</p>
    <p>And the peo­ple of Britain voted to pull their coun­try out of the Euro­pean Union – an event of­ten pre­sented as the height of pop­ulism – at a time in 2016 when ev­ery­one treated Mr Trump’s can­di­da­ture in the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion as a joke. Con­nect­ing th­ese oth­er­wise dis­parate events just be­cause all re­sulted in a kick in the es­tab­lish­ment’s back­side is not very use­ful.</p>
    <p>SE­LEC­TIVE AP­PLI­CA­TION</p>
    <p>But the most im­por­tant rea­son why the pop­ulism la­bel does not work is that it seems to ap­ply only se­lec­tively.</p>
    <p>The la­bel has sel­dom been ap­plied to some­one like French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who back in 2017 sprang out of nowhere and ended up smash­ing both of his coun­try’s tra­di­tional political par­ties with a cam­paign which em­pha­sised his anti-es­tab­lish­ment cre­den­tials. What Mr Macron has done is what ev­ery pop­ulist leader dreams of do­ing. Yet, some­how, he is now seen as the es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>Nor does the pop­ulist la­bel seem to ap­ply to Mr Jeremy Cor­byn, the far-left politi­cian who led Britain’s Labour Party into two gen­eral elec­tions with the slo­gan “For the Many, Not the Few”, the ul­ti­mate pop­ulist tune. It seems that at­tack­ing the es­tab­lish­ment from the left is a per­fectly well-es­tab­lished phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>So, to all in­tents and pur­poses, those branded pop­ulists are only the lead­ers who hap­pen to be on the right-wing spec­trum of pol­i­tics and es­pe­cially those who re­gard Mr Trump as their friend. In short, all the peo­ple the lead writ­ers of The New York Times dis­ap­prove of.</p>
    <p>All this mat­ters be­cause, by in­vent­ing a phe­nom­e­non which they can­not ac­cu­rately de­fine, to­day’s main­stream politi­cians risk ig­nor­ing the real elec­toral chal­lenges they face, as well as mis­di­ag­nos­ing the po­ten­tial so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The root causes for the rise of charis­matic lead­ers out­side es­tab­lished political struc­tures and norms are the huge elec­toral frus­tra­tions gen­er­ated by the vast in­equal­i­ties which have opened over the past half cen­tury be­tween the ed­u­cated and the rest of the na­tional pop­u­la­tion, and be­tween cap­i­tal and labour in West­ern in­dus­trial so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>The ed­u­cated up­wardly mo­bile who go to meet­ings of es­tab­lished political par­ties and who pick the lead­ers of th­ese par­ties have gained hugely from glob­al­i­sa­tion and see no rea­son why the process should not con­tinue.</p>
    <p>But those with­out col­lege ed­u­ca­tion have not only fallen be­hind; they have also lost their voice, as the es­tab­lished political par­ties not only fail to rep­re­sent them, but are obliv­i­ous to the need to even lis­ten to what ails or­di­nary peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Nowhere is this more ob­vi­ous than in the ob­ses­sion which many cen­tre-left political par­ties have had in re­cent West­ern elec­toral cam­paigns with ques­tions such as gen­der and trans­gen­der iden­ti­ties – favourite pas­times of the ur­ban elites – at a time when many of their po­ten­tial vot­ers are look­ing for re­as­sur­ance that they can keep their liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Add to this the tech­no­log­i­cal changes which elim­i­nate jobs and re­duce the bar­gain­ing pow­ers of trade unions, as well as the ex­plo­sion in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy which pro­vides fer­tile ground for con­spir­acy the­o­ries and a col­lapse of pop­u­lar trust in ex­ist­ing in­sti­tu­tions, and the ground is set for up­end­ing the en­tire political or­der.</p>
    <p>NO OBI-WAN</p>
    <p>Seen from this per­spec­tive, there­fore, Mr Bi­den’s elec­toral vic­tory may not sig­nify the end of pop­ulism, if by that con­cept one means the re­jec­tion of the es­tab­lished or­der; in­stead, the Bi­den pres­i­dency could well end up it­self as the aber­ra­tion, be­fore a re­turn to an­other leader who chal­lenges the en­tire sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>In­deed, a good case can be made that the chief prob­lem with the Trump pres­i­dency was Mr Trump him­self, who was far too undis­ci­plined to ex­e­cute his own pop­ulist agenda which, af­ter all, earned the largest num­ber of votes for any sit­ting pres­i­dent in US his­tory.</p>
    <p>So, in the hands of some­one more dis­ci­plined, anti-es­tab­lish­ment pol­i­tics Amer­ica-style may well prove to be alive and well.</p>
    <p>Does that make pop­ulists in­vin­ci­ble, pos­sessed with in­de­struc­tible pow­ers sim­i­lar to those of Obi-Wan Kenobi of the Star Wars films, who fa­mously pro­claimed that “if you strike me down, I shall be­come more pow­er­ful than you can pos­si­bly imag­ine”?</p>
    <p>Not at all. Those who claim to rep­re­sent the dis­pos­sessed of­ten have no bet­ter an­swers to what ails their na­tions and are very fre­quently also part of the es­tab­lish­ment which they claim to fight.</p>
    <p>But de­feat­ing such so-called pop­ulism will re­quire more than just the re­moval from power of Mr Trump, or suc­cumb­ing to the political nos­tal­gia of be­liev­ing that the “good old times” when es­tab­lished political par­ties and politi­cians reigned supreme are about to re­turn.</p>
    <p>The root causes for the rise of charis­matic lead­ers out­side es­tab­lished political struc­tures and norms are the huge elec­toral frus­tra­tions gen­er­ated by the vast in­equal­i­ties which have opened over the past half cen­tury be­tween the ed­u­cated and the rest of the na­tional pop­u­la­tion, and be­tween cap­i­tal and labour in West­ern in­dus­trial so­ci­eties.... Those with­out col­lege ed­u­ca­tion... have also lost their voice, as the es­tab­lished political par­ties not only fail to rep­re­sent them, but are obliv­i­ous to the need to even lis­ten to what ails or­di­nary peo­ple.</p>
