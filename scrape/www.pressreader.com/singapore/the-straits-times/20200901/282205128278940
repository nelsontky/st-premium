    <p>Ed­ward Chia Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC</p>
    <p>Mr Chia, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Tim­bre Group, asked for more sup­port for small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) try­ing to re­vive and trans­form their busi­nesses dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>He said it is time to re­think ideas like “let fail­ing com­pa­nies die” and start think­ing of how to “en­able fail­ing com­pa­nies to re­bound and restart”. He sug­gested a fair ten­ancy frame­work to pro­vide a fair en­vi­ron­ment where SMEs can thrive, as well as a push for more cross-sec­tor col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Our ap­proach with our work­ers is that we can­not save ev­ery job, but we will look af­ter ev­ery worker. Our ap­proach for our SMEs and en­trepreneur­s should be the same. While we can­not save ev­ery busi­ness, we should part­ner ev­ery en­tre­pre­neur to evolve, help them with a soft land­ing, pro­vide them with a longer run­way and help them restart.”</p>
    <p>Don Wee Chua Chu Kang GRC</p>
    <p>Mr Wee, a se­nior vice-pres­i­dent at United Over­seas Bank, asked for more to be done to en­sure ev­ery­one starts from a sim­i­lar play­ing field, and sug­gested set­ting aside more funds to scale up the KidS­tart pro­gramme, which helps chil­dren up till age six from low-in­come fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee also spoke about giv­ing more sup­port to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, mak­ing a con­stant ef­fort to im­prove so­cial mo­bil­ity, and re­duc­ing stig­ma­ti­sa­tion of those with men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>“We must still en­sure that ev­ery­one has a sim­i­lar play­ing field to start from, and that should start from as young as pre-school. No sys­tem should stop par­ents from in­vest­ing in their own chil­dren, but any sys­tem should at­tempt to min­imise in­equal­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Gan Siow Huang Mary­mount</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion and Man­power</p>
    <p>Ms Gan, who was deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute, said there are calls for com­pa­nies to rely less on for­eign­ers, but that in or­der to do so in a sus­tained way, Sin­ga­pore needs to in­crease work pro­duc­tiv­ity to bring down over­all de­mand for labour and also im­prove its to­tal fer­til­ity rate.</p>
    <p>She sug­gested that sec­tors less de­sir­able to Sin­ga­pore­ans should trans­form and re­design their jobs.</p>
    <p>“Our Sin­ga­porean core may be lim­ited by the size of our cit­i­zen pop­u­la­tion, but we can be mighty if we dif­fer­en­ti­ate our­selves from oth­ers by be­ing iden­ti­fied with the val­ues of open­ness, mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism and self-de­ter­mi­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mariam Jaa­far Sem­bawang GRC</p>
    <p>Ms Mariam, a man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at a con­sul­tancy firm, said that while the coun­try pushes for Sin­ga­pore­ans to learn more skills, em­ploy­ers must be more ac­count­able for em­ploy­ees’ learn­ing. They must also be will­ing to give more Sin­ga­pore­ans a chance, look­ing past pa­per qual­i­fi­ca­tions and past ex­pe­ri­ence when hir­ing, and in­stead fo­cus on skills.</p>
    <p>She said em­ploy­ers can of­fer pre-skilling, up­skilling and reskilling op­por­tu­ni­ties, as the Govern­ment sharp­ens and scales up schemes for job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>“If peo­ple get a bad taste that no mat­ter how hard they work, the sys­tem is stacked against them, it leads to cyn­i­cism. And be­cause we Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­tu­ally have a strong sense of fair­ness and root­ing for the un­der­dog, if peo­ple see too many peo­ple around them like that, it can lead to po­lar­i­sa­tion, which only hurts our com­pet­i­tive­ness.”</p>
