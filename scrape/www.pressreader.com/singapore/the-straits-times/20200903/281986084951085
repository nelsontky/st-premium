    <p>This year, we opened Par­lia­ment sooner than we usu­ally do af­ter a gen­eral elec­tion, be­cause we have ur­gent busi­ness deal­ing with Covid-19 and the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has caused a mas­sive up­heaval in our lives. Af­ter eight gru­elling months, we have sta­bilised our sit­u­a­tion. But it has taken a tremen­dous ef­fort to get here.</p>
    <p>From the very be­gin­ning when Covid-19 hit us, our over­rid­ing con­sid­er­a­tion was to pro­tect the lives of Sin­ga­pore­ans. Many coun­tries talked about flat­ten­ing the curve, in­fec­tion curve, of let­ting the dis­ease burn through the pop­u­la­tion un­til herd im­mu­nity de­vel­oped. But that would have meant many Sin­ga­pore­ans get­ting ill, and per­haps thou­sands dy­ing, es­pe­cially the old and vul­ner­a­ble. We were de­ter­mined right from the very be­gin­ning not to go down that route.</p>
    <p>Im­ple­ment­ing the circuit breaker in April was a very big move. We knew that it would cause ex­ten­sive so­cial and eco­nomic dis­rup­tion and de­mand ma­jor sac­ri­fices from Sin­ga­pore­ans. But we de­cided, Cab­i­net de­cided we had to go ahead to slow down the in­fec­tion rate and get things firmly un­der con­trol, buy us time.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, we timed the circuit breaker right and luck­ily it worked. Each of these op­er­a­tions was huge and all of them had to be done in par­al­lel. Thanks to the heroic ef­forts of many un­sung he­roes work­ing qui­etly be­hind the scenes, we’ve got here to­day.</p>
    <p>SUC­CESSES AND SHORT­COM­INGS</p>
    <p>Judg­ing by the health out­comes we’ve done well so far. Our fa­tal­ity rate and ab­so­lute num­bers are one of the low­est in the world. New in­fec­tions in the com­mu­nity are down to just a hand­ful a day. Fewer than 100 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal. And this has given us the con­fi­dence to re­open our econ­omy and so­ci­ety grad­u­ally and care­fully.</p>
    <p>Of course, our Covid-19 re­sponse was not with­out short­com­ings.</p>
    <p>With hind­sight, we would cer­tainly have done some things dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, I wish we had known ear­lier that peo­ple with Covid-19 were in­fec­tious even when they were asymp­to­matic, didn’t show any symp­toms. Then when we brought Sin­ga­pore­ans back home from all over the world in March, we would have quar­an­tined all of them ear­lier, in­stead of only those re­turn­ing from cer­tain coun­tries, so that the virus did not spread to their fam­ily mem­bers or their col­leagues and friends.</p>
    <p>And we would have tested all of them be­fore re­leas­ing them from quar­an­tine whether or not they showed any symp­toms, in­stead of as­sum­ing that no symp­toms meant no in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>We would also have rec­om­mended that ev­ery­one wear face masks sooner than we did. But at the time we took the best avail­able sci­en­tific ad­vice. Once the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion recog­nised that asymp­to­matic trans­mis­sion was a ma­jor prob­lem, we changed our pol­icy and dis­trib­uted face masks to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>We would also have acted more ag­gres­sively and sooner on the mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries. We knew that com­mu­nal liv­ing in the dorms poses an in­fec­tion risk. Com­mu­nal liv­ing in any form poses risks, on board ships and army camps and stu­dent hos­tels, nurs­ing homes.</p>
    <p>We stepped up pre­cau­tions. For a time, these seemed ad­e­quate. But then big­ger clus­ters broke out in the dorms, which threat­ened to over­whelm us. All this is wis­dom af­ter the fact. We must learn from these er­rors and do bet­ter the next time. But in the fog of war, it’s not pos­si­ble al­ways to make the per­fect de­ci­sions. Yet we have to de­cide and move. We can­not af­ford to wait.</p>
    <p>The key is to watch things closely, learn from ex­pe­ri­ence, and adapt our re­sponses promptly as new in­for­ma­tion emerges and as the sit­u­a­tion changes.</p>
    <p>I know we have made things more dif­fi­cult and bur­den­some for em­ploy­ers, es­pe­cially the con­trac­tors and sub-con­trac­tors. They have found it frus­trat­ing to deal with all the new rules, ap­provals and in­spec­tions, even as they try to get their busi­nesses up and run­ning again. But I hope that they un­der­stand that we are do­ing our best to smooth things out for them, and are do­ing all this in or­der to keep our peo­ple safe.</p>
    <p>It’s bet­ter that we make these mea­sures work and get busi­nesses to op­er­ate safely than to suf­fer a new out­break and have to shut down again.</p>
    <p>Over­all, we’ve been able to deal with Covid-19 only be­cause the pub­lic ser­vice, the po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship, our busi­nesses, and the Sin­ga­pore pub­lic have worked closely together, each do­ing their part and more.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is cur­rently sta­ble but we must not let our guard down. A re­cent Straits Times sur­vey showed that al­most half the re­spon­dents were weary of the safety mea­sures. The irony is the more suc­cess­ful we are in keep­ing cases low, the more peo­ple won­der whether all these painful mea­sures are necessary.</p>
    <p>LESSONS FROM COVID-19</p>
    <p>I re­cently re­ceived an e-mail from a univer­sity stu­dent. His so­cial­is­ing had been dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>He com­plained that our re­ac­tion to Covid-19 was one of the great­est over­re­ac­tions to a pub­lic health is­sue. As proof he pointed out that our hospi­tal sys­tems were far from over­whelmed. He said that i nstead, we should let young Sin­ga­pore­ans do us the ser­vice of achiev­ing herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>You only have to look at the sit­u­a­tion in other cities that have let this hap­pen to imag­ine how this could have turned out for us.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 virus re­mains as in­fec­tious and po­tent as it was be­fore. This has not changed. What has changed is that we have taken mea­sures and we have built up our ca­pa­bil­i­ties to con­tain it. If we re­lax these mea­sures now be­cause the num­bers have come down, we will have a resur­gence. Just look at Europe and many other places in the world.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 will not be our last pub­lic health cri­sis. Sars was 17 years ago in 2003. Af­ter Sars we knew that sooner or later, an­other novel pathogen would ap­pear and pose a threat to hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>So we had bet­ter l earn from Covid-19, how to deal with a pan­demic and be as ready as we can through the worst one when the worst one be­falls us. Even as we man­age the im­me­di­ate sit­u­a­tion, we must look for­ward and pre­pare for life af­ter Covid-19.</p>
    <p>SO­CIAL SAFETY NETS</p>
    <p>Let me start with so­cial safety nets. In our early decades of na­tion­hood, we did not need ex­ten­sive so­cial safety nets. We had high gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and in­come growth, jobs were aplenty for a young pop­u­la­tion. The econ­omy was buoy­ant, un­em­ploy­ment af­ter the first few years was very low. If you lost your job, a new one was just around the cor­ner. Now, we’ve moved into a dif­fer­ent phase of de­vel­op­ment. Our econ­omy is ma­tur­ing, in­comes are grow­ing less rapidly. There is a higher premium on spe­cialised skills and ed­u­ca­tion. As a re­sult, when some­one loses his job, es­pe­cially as a ma­ture worker, it’s harder for them to move to an­other job, es­pe­cially across dif­fer­ent sec­tors.</p>
    <p>There­fore in the last 15 years or so, we shifted our ap­proach and pro­gres­sively strength­ened our so­cial safety nets.</p>
    <p>We in­tro­duced many schemes in these last 15 years – ComCare in 2005, Work­fare in 2007, Sil­ver Sup­port in 2016. These schemes and many oth­ers are tar­geted at the lower in­come, and those who have fallen on hard times. They sup­ple­ment their wages and Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions, so that the re­cip­i­ents gain both cur­rent in­come and also re­tire­ment se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>As we ex­panded our so­cial pro­grammes, we’ve also ex­tended the cov­er­age of other schemes and sub­si­dies be­yond the lower in­come to in­clude mid­dle-in­come house­holds too.</p>
    <p>We also give spe­cial sup­port to our Pi­o­neer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions to help them see through their re­tire­ment years. Al­to­gether, we now spend three times as much on so­cial pro­grammes ev­ery year as we did 15 years ago. These are all peace­time mea­sures. But when Covid-19 hit us, they could not be enough.</p>
    <p>We had to draw on our past re­serves to fund them. These are emer­gency mea­sures. They are cru­cial for now, but they can­not con­tinue in­def­i­nitely. We have to start think­ing about what comes af­ter them, about the level of so­cial sup­port we will re­turn to af­ter Covid-19 is over.</p>
    <p>In the new normal, we fully ex­pect more eco­nomic un­cer­tainty and tur­bu­lence and the longert­erm trends of an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and ris­ing health­care costs re­main un­changed. So we’ll cer­tainly need to strengthen so­cial sup­port for our peo­ple dur­ing and af­ter their work­ing lives.</p>
    <p>How will we do this?</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ideas have been raised, in­clud­ing in this House in this de­bate. The Gov­ern­ment is not ide­o­log­i­cally op­posed to any pro­posed so­lu­tion. Our ap­proach has al­ways been prag­matic and em­pir­i­cal; make the best use of our re­sources to meet the needs of dif­fer­ent groups in our so­ci­ety in a tar­geted man­ner, be­cause if we help ev­ery­one equally, then we are not giv­ing more help to those who need it most.</p>
    <p>Take, for ex­am­ple, older work­ers. Older work­ers are valu­able and ex­pe­ri­enced. Hav­ing been in the work­force for longer, they tend to draw higher salaries than younger work­ers. But their skills may be less cur­rent. If they lose their jobs, they find it harder to find an­other sim­i­lar job, par­tic­u­larly at the same pay. So they are at greater risk of long-term un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>So­lu­tions like un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance can of­fer older work­ers tran­sient re­lief at best. But re­train­ing and up­skilling older work­ers will en­able em­ploy­ers to con­tinue find­ing value in them and to be less likely to make them re­dun­dant. And if the older worker does get re­trenched, with these skills he or she can find a new job more read­ily.</p>
    <p>The best un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance is in fact the as­sur­ance of an­other job.</p>
    <p>An­other group is the low-wage work­ers. We need to sup­port them to im­prove their lives, so that they can catch up and nar­row the gap with the rest of so­ci­ety. The Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment has made a ma­te­rial dif­fer­ence to them, and we’ve been en­hanc­ing the Work­fare scheme ev­ery now and again. And in this down­turn, we made a spe­cial pay­ment un­der the Work­fare scheme, be­cause we want to help those who are most in need and we don’t want to put the bur­den on em­ploy­ers. The Gov­ern­ment takes it on.</p>
    <p>The pro­gres­sive wage model has also helped them. And we will ex­tend the pro­gres­sive wage model, as you’ve heard from Ms Josephine Teo yes­ter­day, to more sec­tors over time.</p>
    <p>We should take some time to assess the land­scape af­ter Covid-19 to see how things un­fold and what spe­cific prob­lems de­velop. We</p>
    <p>must keep an open mind as we build and im­prove on the sys­tems we have and con­sider so­lu­tions that can work in our con­text.</p>
    <p>FOUNDERS AND IN­HER­I­TORS</p>
    <p>It’s not just float­ing ideas like min­i­mum wage or un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance, but as­sess­ing their im­pact care­fully – who wins and who loses within the work­force, how will our SMEs or the pub­lic be af­fected?</p>
    <p>We must iden­tify prag­matic so­lu­tions which will make a real and sus­tain­able dif­fer­ence and give peo­ple jus­ti­fied as­sur­ance that when they need help, they will get the help that is rel­e­vant to them. And it must not cre­ate new prob­lems in the process, for ex­am­ple, by erod­ing our spirit of self-re­liance.</p>
    <p>One per­ma­nent im­per­a­tive as we think about new schemes is to keep our pro­grammes fis­cally sus­tain­able. As a mat­ter of prin­ci­ple, our so­cial safety nets should be paid for out of cur­rent rev­enues. We should not draw down on what we have in­her­ited, nor should we mort­gage the fu­ture of our chil­dren.</p>
    <p>When our found­ing gen­er­a­tion was build­ing up our re­serves, they never asked them­selves whether they had too much sav­ings. The ques­tion was whether we could steadily squir­rel away a bit more in our re­serves year af­ter year, decade af­ter decade, as pro­tec­tion for a rainy day.</p>
    <p>Now the op­po­si­tion says, show me how much we have in the re­serves, be­fore I de­cide whether I sup­port your Bud­get and tax plans. Let’s have a look at the money.</p>
    <p>Ba­si­cally they’re ask­ing, I have some­thing in the bank al­ready. How much of that can I touch? This was not the at­ti­tude of our fore­fa­thers, the founders who were build­ing for the fu­ture, but the at­ti­tude of in­her­i­tors who think they have come into a for­tune and want to con­sume the fruits of their pre­de­ces­sors’ labours. And this is fun­da­men­tally the wrong ap­proach.</p>
    <p>How much re­serves are enough or too much, there can be no good an­swer to this ques­tion. The fu­ture is un­know­able. We have no way to tell what may hit us from out of the blue.</p>
    <p>There­fore, we should not think of our­selves as in­her­i­tors spend­ing what we have been lucky enough to be en­dowed with. Rather we should take the at­ti­tude of founders, even though we may be third, fourth or fifth gen­er­a­tion in re­al­ity, but we should think of our­selves as founders for the fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>What­ever re­serves we have, big or small, let us not think of touch­ing them in normal times. They are our rainy day fund, our guan chai ben. In Chi­nese, it sounds bet­ter. They call it a cof­fin fund.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year we live within our means. And when­ever we are able to, we add a bit more to the rainy day fund to make our­selves a bit more se­cure for when it re­ally pours. And that is the way to build Sin­ga­pore for the long term, and se­cure the fu­ture for our chil­dren</p>
    <p>and grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>FOR­EIGN WORK­ERS</p>
    <p>The sec­ond area that we will re­view is our for­eign worker and work pass poli­cies. This is not a new is­sue, but in an eco­nomic down­turn, this is­sue be­comes sharper. It’s a case not just in Sin­ga­pore. All around the world, anti-for­eigner sen­ti­ment is on the rise, be­cause peo­ple are feel­ing worried and in­se­cure about their fu­tures.</p>
    <p>Many Sin­ga­pore­ans are feel­ing anx­ious and pres­sured about their jobs. Their sense that for­eign­ers are com­pet­ing with them for jobs is pal­pa­ble. Some feel un­fairly treated when they see for­eign­ers re­plac­ing them or tak­ing up good jobs ahead of them. These feel­ings are com­pletely un­der­stand­able.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a small coun­try. Our pop­u­la­tion is small. It’s not grow­ing very fast. Soon it’s go­ing to level off. To grow our econ­omy, we have no choice but to top up with for­eign work­ers and work pass hold­ers. And yet we can­not throw open our doors, just throw open our doors, nor have we done so. We only have 31/ mil­lion Singa</p>
    <p>2 pore cit­i­zens and half a mil­lion per­ma­nent res­i­dents. In South-east Asia, there are 650 mil­lion peo­ple. In Asia, China and In­dia alone add up to nearly three thou­sand mil­lion peo­ple. All can po­ten­tially come in, many would love to come.</p>
    <p>With­out tight con­trols we would be over­whelmed. And that’s why we have our for­eign worker poli­cies. They help us con­trol the in­flow, and ul­ti­mately en­sure that the for­eign work­ers who do come in add to the work­force in Sin­ga­pore rather than sub­sti­tute for them, and ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore­ans rather than hurt­ing them.</p>
    <p>How we con­trol the flow de­pends on the type of for­eign worker. At the lower lev­els, we got work per­mits, and we use a mix of levies and quo­tas – we call them de­pen­dency ra­tios – to di­rectly con­trol their price and quan­tity. It’s a rough and ready ap­proach, but it helps us deal with the large num­bers and limit them ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>In the mid­dle lev­els, we have the S Pass. Now it’s not just a mat­ter of num­bers but we also want to look at the qual­ity. Be­cause the S Pass (hold­ers) are com­pet­ing with peo­ple who are grad­u­at­ing from our polytech­nic, diploma hold­ers and slightly above that and we want to make sure that there’s a bal­ance.</p>
    <p>So the S Pass still has levies and quo­tas, but we also im­pose other re­quire­ments on min­i­mum salary and on qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Then for the up­per lev­els, the PMETs, pro­fes­sion­als, man­age­ment, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cal work­ers, we have the Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP). Here the key is­sue is about con­trol­ling the qual­ity and mak­ing sure that peo­ple we bring in are those who are able to con­trib­ute to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>So we’ve been us­ing salary bench­marks as a proxy, along with other qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>While the per­cep­tion of for­eign com­pe­ti­tion is sharper dur­ing this down­turn, ac­tu­ally both Em­ploy­ment Pass and S Pass hold­ers have</p>
    <p>been com­ing down since Covid-19 this year.</p>
    <p>But we still have to make ad­just­ments to our work pass schemes, be­cause there is now more slack in the job mar­ket but also be­cause over time, the ed­u­ca­tion lev­els, the ca­pa­bil­i­ties and in­comes of our lo­cal work­force have gone up.</p>
    <p>More Sin­ga­pore­ans are now ready and avail­able to take up PMET jobs. And in fact more have done so. The pro­por­tion of PMETs in the work­force has grown steadily from 40 per cent 20 years ago to close to 60 per cent now to­day. And the pur­pose of the Em­ploy­ment Pass scheme is to top up at the higher end of these PMET jobs. There­fore, we need to tighten up the Em­ploy­ment Pass qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>And that is why at the lower lev­els of the Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers, the pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans is higher and at the higher lev­els, the pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans is slightly lower be­cause we’re de­lib­er­ately bring­ing in em­ploy­ment hold­ers, Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers who are at a higher level and can con­trib­ute to us. It makes sense.</p>
    <p>But we need to tighten up the EP qual­i­fy­ing cri­te­ria and this is what we have been do­ing. We raised the EP en­try floor from $3,600 to $3,900 in May this year. And the Min­istry of Man­power just an­nounced last week a fur­ther tight­en­ing to $4,500, with a higher floor of $5,000 for fi­nan­cial ser­vices. We’re rais­ing the S Pass salary floor too.</p>
    <p>We have to pay at­ten­tion to mar­ket con­di­tions and ad­just at the right pace. But this is the cor­rect long-term di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>But I know Sin­ga­pore­ans are not just con­cerned about the macro over­all num­bers, but also at the mi­cro in­di­vid­ual level they are con­cerned about fair treat­ment, that Sin­ga­pore­ans are be­ing con­sid­ered fairly for jobs, for pro­mo­tions, or when it comes time for re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>There is no com­fort in know­ing that the to­tal num­bers are not too many if per­son­ally we feel we have been dis­crim­i­nated against at the work­place or that the EP holder work­ing be­side us some­how has an in­side track be­cause of old school ties or some other per­sonal con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>And that is why we have Tafep, the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices, where Sin­ga­pore­ans who feel un­fairly treated can seek re­dress. We also have a Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work, which we are tight­en­ing fur­ther as you’ve heard.</p>
    <p>And we are work­ing with the unions to make sure any re­trench­ments are done fairly, and no company is re­trench­ing a Sin­ga­porean only to fill the same post with a for­eigner with­out very good jus­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment takes this is­sue of fair­ness very seriously. In eval­u­at­ing EP and S Pass ap­pli­ca­tions, we take into ac­count whether the em­ployer has kept up sup­port of lo­cal PMETs in their em­ploy­ment, and has been re­spon­sive to gov­ern</p>
    <p>ment ef­forts to help them re­cruit and train more Sin­ga­porean PMETs. Or con­versely, whether the em­ployer has dis­crim­i­nated against qual­i­fied Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>This has al­ways been the gov­ern­ment pol­icy, but we par­tic­u­larly want to em­pha­sise these con­sid­er­a­tions now in these un­cer­tain times to re­mind all em­ploy­ers to play their part in build­ing up the Sin­ga­porean work­force, the Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>One spe­cific red flag is when we see a company that has an over­con­cen­tra­tion of a sin­gle for­eign na­tion­al­ity in its ranks, es­pe­cially when com­pared to other com­pa­nies in the same sec­tor. This con­cen­tra­tion, if it is unchecked, can cause so­cial re­sent­ment and work­place prob­lems.</p>
    <p>It makes it harder for the company to blend into and be ac­cepted by our mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety. It can cause prob­lems within the company too be­cause em­ploy­ees of other na­tion­al­i­ties, Sin­ga­pore­ans or oth­ers, may find it harder to fit in, to take pride in their work and see a fu­ture for them­selves in the firm.</p>
    <p>There­fore when that hap­pens, we ask the firm to please relook their hir­ing prac­tices. Most com­pa­nies are re­spon­sive and work with us in good faith. In fact, many global com­pa­nies un­der­stand that a di­verse work­force is to their ad­van­tage and have ex­plicit hu­man re­source poli­cies for this.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of con­cen­tra­tion can eas­ily be played up. And we know that there are some peo­ple who are stir­ring this up. For ex­am­ple, a Face­book page posted the we­fie of DBS CEO Piyush Gupta with a room full of In­dian em­ploy­ees last Sep­tem­ber. It was cap­tioned “Eye­sight Test. Find a Sin­ga­porean or Chi­nese in this DBS photo”.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture resur­faced re­cently and went vi­ral, which just shows that dur­ing tough times this sub­ject is more neu­ral­gic. Last Sep­tem­ber was a dif­fer­ent world. Many peo­ple took of­fence, got worked up and be­rated DBS, flamed them. But it was fake news.</p>
    <p>Why? That pic­ture was taken in In­dia, where DBS had opened a new of­fice, and not in Sin­ga­pore. The per­son who put up the post surely knew this, yet he ir­re­spon­si­bly mis­used the we­fie to in­sin­u­ate that DBS in Sin­ga­pore was not be­ing fair to Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>And dam­age was done.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will al­ways be on the side of Sin­ga­pore­ans. What is the point of cre­at­ing jobs for for­eign­ers if it doesn’t ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore­ans? Why would we want to do that?</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, our aim is to grow the econ­omy, cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans and raise our standards of liv­ing. For­eign work­ers and work pass hold­ers help us to achieve this.</p>
    <p>GUARD­ING OUR REP­U­TA­TION</p>
    <p>By be­ing open to tal­ent from all over the world, we cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for our­selves.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has suc­ceeded by be­ing an in­ter­na­tional hub tap­ping tal­ents world­wide and serv­ing a global mar­ket. So even as we ad­just our work pass poli­cies, we must be care­ful not to give the wrong im­pres­sion that we are now clos­ing up and no longer wel­com­ing for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Such a rep­u­ta­tion would do us great harm.</p>
    <p>We are con­scious that IT is one of the ar­eas where we worry about an over-con­cen­tra­tion of for­eign work pass hold­ers. But when you get a good project like this, an IT cen­tre for a ma­jor for­eign bank, ma­jor global bank, want­ing to come to Sin­ga­pore, and there­fore go­ing to re­cruit a pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­porean IT pro­fes­sion­als and other EPs, other man­age­ment staff, should we say no?</p>
    <p>They see good prospects in Sin­ga­pore. They see us as a sta­ble base to work from. We want to talk to them, to see how they can fit in here in Sin­ga­pore to cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>But for them to come here, they must feel wel­come and be al­lowed to bring in the tal­ent that they need, be­cause we don’t have the full com­ple­ment of spe­cial­ist en­gi­neers and other ex­per­tise for all these types of work yet.</p>
    <p>And also, regional and global head­quar­ters by de­sign need to draw tal­ent from around the world and to be run by in­ter­na­tional teams. That’s the na­ture of regional and global head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>And if we want good com­pa­nies to come to Sin­ga­pore, we must be pre­pared to have them come and to bring to Sin­ga­pore that con­stel­la­tion of tal­ent to be able to op­er­ate out of Sin­ga­pore and man­age ac­tiv­i­ties and lo­ca­tions all over the world. They will em­ploy Sin­ga­pore­ans too, but they can­not be staffed by Sin­ga­pore­ans alone.</p>
    <p>Once these com­pa­nies es­tab­lish them­selves here, most Sin­ga­pore­ans will be able to take ad­van­tage of the op­por­tu­ni­ties they cre­ate, pick up their skills and knowl­edge and rise up the ranks. This is how we’ve al­ways done it.</p>
    <p>But it’s not just global com­pa­nies that need for­eign man­power. Lo­cal com­pa­nies also need global tal­ent to grow and de­velop. Our SMEs need skills, knowl­edge and ex­per­tise that they may not have in Sin­ga­pore, for ex­am­ple, to de­velop an ex­ter­nal wing and to move up the value chain. And by do­ing so, they too cre­ate good new jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, be­sides, pro­mot­ing en­trepreneur­ship and mak­ing it eas­ier and more at­trac­tive to start com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>So the eco­nomic ben­e­fits of our for­eign worker poli­cies are very clear. But there’s a more fun­da­men­tal ques­tion which we have to ask our­selves, and that is what sort of so­ci­ety, what sort of peo­ple do we want to be?</p>
    <p>We’ve al­ways been a peo­ple open to the world, wel­com­ing oth­ers who can add value to our so­ci­ety, and bring the best out of us. This is our his­tory and our ethos from our begin­nings as an open port and an im­mi­grant na­tion. The bi­cen­ten­nial last year re­minded us of that.</p>
    <p>This gen­eros­ity of spirit gives our so­ci­ety and econ­omy vi­tal­ity and re­silience. It’s made Sin­ga­pore the ex­cep­tional cos­mopoli­tan city that we are to­day plugged into the global econ­omy and mak­ing a liv­ing by mak­ing our­selves valu­able to the world.</p>
    <p>We may be un­der stress now but we can­not af­ford to turn in­wards. We will ad­just our poli­cies to safe­guard Sin­ga­porean jobs. But let us show con­fi­dence that Sin­ga­pore­ans can hold our own in the world.</p>
    <p>NEW EX­PEC­TA­TIONS</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will lead this con­ver­sa­tion with Sin­ga­pore­ans, build a po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus around the right so­lu­tions and move us for­ward. Whether we suc­ceed de­pends on how well our pol­i­tics work. Sin­ga­pore has achieved a high de­gree of po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus on many of our so­cial and po­lit­i­cal is­sues, and eco­nomic is­sues. This is one ma­jor rea­son for our rapid progress and one ma­jor ben­e­fit of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s (PAP) dom­i­nant po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>But our so­ci­ety is not static. Each new gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans is more ed­u­cated, more con­nected to the world, and surer of them­selves. Their at­ti­tudes and as­pi­ra­tions change too. They de­sire more di­ver­sity, al­ter­na­tive voices and checks and bal­ances.</p>
    <p>This trend is not new. The de­sire has al­ways been there but it is grow­ing.</p>
    <p>In the last gen­eral elec­tion, many peo­ple voted for the op­po­si­tion, while fully ex­pect­ing that the PAP would re­main in power as the Gov­ern­ment. In fact, the Work­ers’ Party cam­paigned on this plat­form, if I’m not mis­taken, seek­ing to form a strong op­po­si­tion but ex­plic­itly not seek­ing to form the next gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The PAP will re­spond to these so­cial and po­lit­i­cal trends as we have al­ways done. We have not stayed on top all these years by be­ing static, but by adapt­ing to our evolv­ing so­ci­ety and chang­ing needs. We have been as­sid­u­ous in our lead­er­ship re­newal. Each new gen­er­a­tion of PAP lead­ers has de­vel­oped their own lead­er­ship styles and their own pol­icy pri­or­i­ties. They’ve cre­ated their own bonds with their gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans to be in sync with their mood to win their trust and sup­port and de­velop new ideas that res­onate with them.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his found­ing gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers gov­erned Sin­ga­pore in a di­rect no-non­sense way. It was necessary and ap­pro­pri­ate at the time, and Sin­ga­pore­ans then strongly sup­ported Mr Lee. Mr Goh Chok Tong and his team had a dif­fer­ent touch. His ap­proach was about bring­ing peo­ple together and build­ing a so­ci­etal con­sen­sus on the next lap of Sin­ga­pore’s growth. It was a con­trast to Mr Lee’s ap­proach, but it was ap­pro­pri­ate for his gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans, and Mr Goh made it work.</p>
    <p>My team and I are not like Mr Lee. Nei­ther are we like ESM Goh’s teams. We found our own ways to en­gage with this gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>My suc­ces­sors will have to do things in their own dif­fer­ent ways too, es­tab­lish their own stand­ing and build their own bonds with the next gen­er­a­tion. The 4G lead­ers have been do­ing this for some time. They are con­duct­ing the SGTo­gether con­ver­sa­tions now. They want to ac­com­mo­date this grow­ing de­sire of Sin­ga­pore­ans not only to be heard but to be in­volved.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment, with a stronger op­po­si­tion pres­ence, I ex­pect the tone of the de­bate to shift. PAP min­is­ters and MPs will have to raise their game, be pre­pared for sharper ques­tion­ing and de­fend the Gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies and de­ci­sions, while speak­ing up for their con­stituents. They also must be pre­pared for more sub­stan­tive de­bates and en­gage­ment with the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>I hope the op­po­si­tion will also step up, go be­yond ask­ing ques­tions and crit­i­cis­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s pro­pos­als, which is part of their re­spon­si­bil­ity, to go on to put up se­ri­ous pro­pos­als and ideas of their own to be ex­am­ined and de­bated, and if found mer­i­to­ri­ous, adopted, to show that they are will­ing and able to play their part as a loyal op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>For our part, the Gov­ern­ment will take an open and con­struc­tive ap­proach. And let me ex­plain what I mean by this bland term “open and con­struc­tive ap­proach”.</p>
    <p>On the spe­cific de­tails of poli­cies, we can be quite re­laxed about it. We will be open-minded, we’ll lis­ten to the dif­fer­ent voices. We can try dif­fer­ent schemes, so­lu­tions. We will take in all con­struc­tive views and per­spec­tives. But we of course have to make sure that the dis­cus­sions are sup­ported by facts and logic and in­formed by our con­text and ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>But if it is a ma­jor is­sue which con­cerns the fun­da­men­tal in­ter­ests of the coun­try, the Gov­ern­ment can­not wait pas­sively for a con­sen­sus to form. We will still have a full dis­cus­sion, in fact prob­a­bly an even fuller dis­cus­sion. But at the end of the dis­cus­sion, if there are still dif­fer­ent views, the Gov­ern­ment will have to make the de­ci­sion it judges best and take re­spon­si­bil­ity for it. Hav­ing been elected to gov­ern, we must gov­ern.</p>
    <p>WEST­MIN­STER-STYLE POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>That’s on is­sues. But pol­i­tics is not only about is­sues but also about power. And if the is­sue is not poli­cies and pri­or­i­ties, but a chal­lenge to the Gov­ern­ment’s fit­ness to gov­ern, then the Gov­ern­ment will have to stand up and de­fend it­self vig­or­ously. It must put down the chal­lenge and prove that it de­serves to be the Gov­ern­ment, be­cause oth­er­wise it must step aside and let an­other team take over. This is how the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is sup­posed to work.</p>
    <p>We have a West­min­ster style of democ­racy mod­elled on the Bri­tish and adapted as we have gone along. It’s ad­ver­sar­ial by de­sign. In Par­lia­ment, the leader of the op­po­si­tion sits on the op­po­site front bench di­rectly op­po­site the prime minister. That’s why Mr Pri­tam Singh is there sit­ting op­po­site me. He is not there as a sup­port­ive cheer­leader, help­ing the Gov­ern­ment to per­form bet­ter.</p>
    <p>He is there to chal­lenge the in­cum­bent PM and the Gov­ern­ment to point out their faults, to high­light where the Gov­ern­ment has fallen short, to keep chip­ping away at the Gov­ern­ment’s and the PM’s cred­i­bil­ity. And so at the next gen­eral elec­tion, or sooner if the op­por­tu­nity arises, the op­po­si­tion can knock the Gov­ern­ment out of power and take its place.</p>
    <p>I’m see­ing this not as a crit­i­cism of any po­lit­i­cal party in Sin­ga­pore or any­body in Sin­ga­pore, but I’m say­ing this is how the sys­tem is de­signed to work.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery en­counter is a glad­i­a­to­rial con­test. Lots of drama and the­atre and pre­pared sound­bites. The wit­tier and more con­temp­tu­ous, the bet­ter. The Bri­tish or Aus­tralian PM has to stand his ground, de­fend his gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies and main­tain psy­cho­log­i­cal dom­i­nance to show that he de­serves to be the PM.</p>
    <p>If not, MPs on both sides will sense it, and so will the pub­lic. And this will in­flu­ence elec­tion out­comes as well as lead­er­ship con­tests in their par­ties.</p>
    <p>I lis­tened care­fully to Mr Pri­tam Singh on Mon­day de­scrib­ing how he in­tends to per­form the role of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion. I ap­plaud his tone and his ap­proach. The gov­ern­ment benches will do our part to work with him to keep Par­lia­ment a con­struc­tive fo­rum for de­bate.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that it’s good to have an ad­e­quate num­ber of op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment. It keeps the Gov­ern­ment on its toes. It shows the pub­lic that the Gov­ern­ment has noth­ing to hide, and will an­swer all ques­tions, how­ever awk­ward. But that does not mean that the more op­po­si­tion MPs and the more fiery the de­bate in Par­lia­ment is, the bet­ter. Or that the tone of our po­lit­i­cal de­bate can­not change for the worst.</p>
    <p>The ad­ver­sar­ial dy­namic that is in­her­ent in the par­lia­men­tary sys­tem can go wrong. We all hope that di­ver­sity will make a hun­dred flow­ers bloom. But how do we pre­vent di­ver­sity from pro­duc­ing po­lar­i­sa­tion? How do we make sure that dis­agree­ment does not re­sult in paral­y­sis?</p>
    <p>It has hap­pened in so many other coun­tries. Pol­i­tics per­me­ates ev­ery is­sue. Ev­ery sub­ject be­comes par­ti­san. Even pub­lic health is­sues, whether to wear a mask or not, be­comes a par­ti­san is­sue. If this hap­pens to Sin­ga­pore, we will not just cease be­ing an ex­cep­tional na­tion, it will be the end of us.</p>
    <p>We must not go down this path. At the most fun­da­men­tal level to make our pol­i­tics work, both the Gov­ern­ment and op­po­si­tion must share an over­rid­ing ob­jec­tive, to work for Sin­ga­pore, and not just for our party or our sup­port­ers. Our de­bate must be based on prin­ci­ples and facts and guided by shared ideals and goals.</p>
    <p>MPs must speak up for what they sin­cerely be­lieve in. You are elected not just to re­peat what you have heard oth­ers say, but to think on be­half of oth­ers and to make ar­gu­ments which make sense, which will ben­e­fit the in­ter­ests of the peo­ple you are rep­re­sent­ing, of the vot­ers who elected you. But to think for your­self and not just to be a mouth­piece.</p>
    <p>We must be in pol­i­tics in or­der to pro­tect Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity, grow our econ­omy and se­cure our fu­ture. If we do that, then there’s a ba­sis for us to man­age the in­her­ent ten­sions in our sys­tem and for pol­i­tics to work out pro­duc­tively.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately what sort of pol­i­tics Sin­ga­pore has de­pends on Sin­ga­pore­ans them­selves be­cause they have a vi­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­gage in the pub­lic dis­course, to send the right sig­nals at the bal­lot box, to re­ward po­lit­i­cal par­ties that do the right thing and de­liver for the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The standards they de­mand of po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, PAP and op­po­si­tion, will in­flu­ence the qual­ity of the po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship, the level of dis­cus­sion and de­bate in Par­lia­ment. They will de­ter­mine whether our pol­i­tics en­ables us to thrive and pros­per, or di­vides and de­stroys us.</p>
    <p>PAP’S SPE­CIAL RE­SPON­SI­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Speak­ing for the PAP, we have a spe­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity to make our sys­tem work and pro­vide the lead­er­ship that Sin­ga­pore needs and de­serves. It’s a re­spon­si­bil­ity that the PAP car­ries, but no other po­lit­i­cal party in Sin­ga­pore shares to make our sys­tem work. And let me ex­plain why.</p>
    <p>The PAP is in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked with Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing, its his­tory and de­vel­op­ment. We built this place together with Sin­ga­pore­ans. How pol­i­tics and gov­ern­ment work in Sin­ga­pore is quite unique. We have put enor­mous em­pha­sis on the qual­ity of gov­ern­ment – the pub­lic ser­vice as well as the po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship. We have gone to great lengths to re­cruit the best peo­ple we can find to en­ter pol­i­tics, join the Gov­ern­ment and serve Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This qual­ity of gov­ern­ment, cou­pled with the trust and sup­port of</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, en­ables us to deal with prob­lems ra­tio­nally, com­pre­hen­sively and ef­fec­tively. JeanClaude Juncker, he was Prime Minister of Lux­em­bourg and more re­cently he was Pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, he said this about Euro­pean pol­i­tics and politi­cians: “We all know what to do, we just don’t know how to get re­elected af­ter we’ve done it.”</p>
    <p>But in Sin­ga­pore, the PAP Gov­ern­ment has been able to do the right thing for Sin­ga­pore­ans – some­times dif­fi­cult and hard things – and still get re-elected. Some­times we pay the price in the vote but, over­all, we have con­tin­ued to win elec­tions.</p>
    <p>And there­fore the Gov­ern­ment has been able to think long term, well be­yond the next gen­eral elec­tion. We have no in­cen­tive to kick the can down the road be­cause down the road we will very likely meet the can our­selves again. And there­fore we made plans over 50, 60 years, or in the case of cli­mate change, 100 years. As a re­sult the coun­try pro­gresses, Sin­ga­pore ben­e­fits, and the PAP con­tin­ues to win elec­tions – so far.</p>
    <p>It is a vir­tu­ous, self-re­in­forc­ing cir­cle. This model has worked well for Sin­ga­pore. Once bro­ken, it will be very dif­fi­cult to put it back together again.</p>
    <p>Can it con­tinue to work like this? With more di­ver­sity and con­tes­ta­tion, can we keep our fo­cus on the long term, and plan and build ahead for Sin­ga­pore? How long can Sin­ga­pore­ans vote for the op­po­si­tion in some con­stituen­cies, in the ex­pec­ta­tion that some­how, some­where else, their fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans will en­sure that the PAP is re­turned to power? Can we con­tinue to get good peo­ple into pol­i­tics, to main­tain the qual­ity of our min­is­ters and MPs, and make things hap­pen for Sin­ga­pore, if more and more cit­i­zens pre­fer the PAP to form the Gov­ern­ment and yet vote for an­other party’s can­di­dates to be their MPs for di­ver­sity, for checks and bal­ance?</p>
    <p>At what point does a vote for a strong op­po­si­tion be­come a vote for a dif­fer­ent gov­ern­ment? Is it re­ally true that one day if there is a change of gov­ern­ment, a new party can run Sin­ga­pore equally well, be­cause we have such a good pub­lic ser­vice, as Mr Pri­tam Singh sug­gested on Mon­day? It’s like say­ing you have the New York Phil­har­monic Or­ches­tra, any­body can be the con­duc­tor.</p>
    <p>These ques­tions have no easy an­swers. In the na­ture of pol­i­tics and of hu­man so­ci­eties, things can and do go wrong. Each suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans has to keep on do­ing its best to keep the sys­tem work­ing right.</p>
    <p>The PAP feels acutely its spe­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity to keep on do­ing its best for Sin­ga­pore, and keep Sin­ga­pore work­ing in this unique way. That is our sa­cred mis­sion. We will do our ut­most to per­suade good men and women to en­ter pol­i­tics, to take over the torch and lead the next gen­er­a­tion for­ward. We will fight hard to win the hearts and minds of Sin­ga­pore­ans, and win ev­ery vote and show Sin­ga­pore­ans that the PAP con­tin­ues to de­serve their sup­port and trust.</p>
    <p>Of course, there is no guar­an­tee that even un­der a PAP Gov­ern­ment, Sin­ga­pore will for­ever be suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>Now, the world is not quite the same as it used to be. Our streets and our skies are qui­eter. I re­ceived a for­eign vis­i­tor re­cently, she said she felt sad when she came through Changi Air­port. It used to be bustling, crowded, full of life, now it is deathly si­lent.</p>
    <p>Forty years of build­ing up our air­port and air­line, Covid-19 came, and all of that sud­denly came to a halt.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately what sort of pol­i­tics Sin­ga­pore has de­pends on Sin­ga­pore­ans them­selves be­cause they have a vi­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­gage in the pub­lic dis­course, to send the right sig­nals at the bal­lot box, to re­ward po­lit­i­cal par­ties that do the right thing and de­liver for the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The standards they de­mand of po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, PAP and op­po­si­tion, will in­flu­ence the qual­ity of the po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship, the level of dis­cus­sion and de­bate in Par­lia­ment. They will de­ter­mine whether our pol­i­tics en­ables us to thrive and pros­per, or di­vides and de­stroys us.</p>
    <p>PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG</p>
    <p>THE SIL­VER LIN­ING</p>
    <p>So what now? We have sur­vived many life and death crises be­fore. Sin­ga­pore was born from cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But each time, we did sur­vive, and ac­tu­ally came back stronger. Each time, the dire cir­cum­stances be­came the oc­ca­sion and the plat­form for am­bi­tion and dar­ing. And each time, we tran­scended our­selves and built again.</p>
    <p>We should fight Covid-19 with hope in our hearts, be­cause there is a sil­ver lin­ing. This sear­ing ex­pe­ri­ence will help a whole new gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans ap­pre­ci­ate, trea­sure what we have, and what makes us an ex­cep­tional na­tion.</p>
    <p>We are here by dint of will and imag­i­na­tion, in de­fi­ance of all the odds and of all those who said we wouldn’t make it, we did. As in all the pre­vi­ous crises, Covid-19 will be the oc­ca­sion for us to do bet­ter, emerge stronger, and be­come more united.</p>
    <p>Do not doubt. Do not fear. Jewel will shine again. Changi will thrive again. SIA will be a great way to fly once more. Our econ­omy will pros­per anew. Our chil­dren and our grand­chil­dren will con­tinue march­ing for­ward, to build a fair, ever more just and equal so­ci­ety.</p>
