    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK US dis­tri­bu­tion of Moderna’s Covid-19 vac­cine has be­gun, with more than 3,700 sites due to start re­ceiv­ing and ad­min­is­ter­ing shots as soon as to­day, vastly widen­ing the roll-out started last week by Pfizer.</p>
    <p>Amid record coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and deaths, Moderna has al­ready moved vac­cine sup­plies from its man­u­fac­tur­ing plants to ware­houses.</p>
    <p>Trucks car­ry­ing con­tain­ers packed with the vac­cines set out yes­ter­day and ship­ments will start reach­ing health­care providers as soon as to­day, said Gen­eral Gus­tave Perna of the US Army.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine must travel with se­cu­rity guards, in­clud­ing US Mar­shals, and will be stored in locked re­frig­er­a­tors. US plans call for atrisk groups such as el­derly peo­ple in nurs­ing homes and med­i­cal work­ers to re­ceive in­jec­tions first.</p>
    <p>The Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion last Fri­day ap­proved an emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for Moderna’s vac­cine, the sec­ond Covid-19 vac­cine to re­ceive ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Moderna said a panel of out­side ad­vis­ers to the US Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) voted on Satur­day to rec­om­mend its vac­cine for use in peo­ple aged at least 18. The Ad­vi­sory Com­mit­tee on Im­mu­ni­sa­tion Prac­tices panel voted 11-0 in favour of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The jab de­vel­oped by Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech was au­tho­rised on Dec 11.</p>
    <p>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ser­vices provider Catal­ent’s fa­cil­ity in In­di­ana is fill­ing and pack­ag­ing vials with Moderna vac­cine and hand­ing them to dis­trib­u­tor McKes­son Corp.</p>
    <p>The firm is ship­ping them from its fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing those in</p>
    <p>Louisville, Ken­tucky; and Mem­phis, Ten­nessee, which are close to air hubs for UPS and FedEx.</p>
    <p>Pfizer or­gan­ised its own dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the US Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices said 7.9 mil­lion doses of Pfizer and Moderna vac­cines would be de­liv­ered na­tion­ally this week.</p>
    <p>The Moderna de­liv­ery sys­tem will have some of the same play­ers as Pfizer’s but will dif­fer in key ways.</p>
    <p>UPS and FedEx are giv­ing pri­or­ity to vac­cines on planes and trucks that are mov­ing hol­i­day gifts and other cargo. Their driv­ers will han­dle the bulk of the last-mile Moderna vac­cine de­liv­er­ies, which are go­ing di­rectly to vac­ci­na­tion sites, un­like Pfizer’s vac­cine, which was sent to large hubs and re­dis­tributed.</p>
    <p>“We added a lot of air­craft, a lot of tem­po­rary work­ers. (Vac­cines) are a very small frac­tion of to­tal vol­umes,” said Mr Wes Wheeler, a UPS ex­ec­u­tive in charge of vac­cine ship­ments.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s vac­cine is avail­able in quan­ti­ties as small as 100 doses and can be stored for 30 days in stan­dard-tem­per­a­ture re­frig­er­a­tors, while the in­oc­u­la­tions from Pfizer come in boxes of 975 doses, must be shipped and stored at mi­nus 70 deg C, and can be held for only five days at stan­dard re­frig­er­a­tor tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial doses were given to health pro­fes­sion­als. Pro­grammes by phar­ma­cies Wal­greens and CVS to dis­trib­ute the Pfizer vac­cine to long-term care fa­cil­i­ties are due to start to­day.</p>
    <p>The CDC ad­vi­sory panel was yes­ter­day set to con­sider which groups should get vac­ci­nated next.</p>
    <p>Gen Perna said the United States is on track to have enough doses of vac­cines by the end of the year to in­oc­u­late 20 mil­lion peo­ple, but de­liv­er­ies of those doses may con­tinue into the first week of next month.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines were about 95 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing ill­ness in clin­i­cal tri­als that found no se­ri­ous safety is­sues.</p>
