    <p>LON­DON • Mikel Arteta branded Ni­co­las Pepe’s lack of dis­ci­pline “unac­cept­able” af­ter Arsenal were forced to hold out for a 0-0 draw at Leeds on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Ro­drigo, Pa­trick Bam­ford and Raphinha all hit the wood­work for Marcelo Bielsa’s men af­ter the Ivo­rian winger was sent off six min­utes into the sec­ond half for a head­butt on Ezg­jan Alioski.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old is strug­gling to live up to ex­pec­ta­tions since a £72 mil­lion (S$129 mil­lion) move from Lille 15 months ago and Arteta was fu­ri­ous at his dis­missal af­ter just a sec­ond Premier League start this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s very clear. It is unac­cept­able,” said the Arsenal man­ager when asked what he had told him in the dress­ing room.</p>
    <p>“When Pepe let the team down, I re­ally liked the per­son­al­ity of the team, how we suf­fered to­gether and be­lieved in what we had to do.”</p>
    <p>A point leaves both sides in the bot­tom half of the ta­ble, as Arsenal edged up to 11th with Leeds two points back in 14th.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Gun­ners de­fender Hector Bellerin ad­mit­ted the draw was “not enough for us”, with the vis­i­tors hav­ing failed to score from</p>
    <p>open play in five Premier League games.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore be­ing re­duced to 10 men, Arteta’s men of­fered pre­cious lit­tle go­ing for­ward de­spite</p>
    <p>Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang be­ing played down the mid­dle for the first time in the league un­der the Spa­niard.</p>
    <p>The Arsenal cap­tain was starved of ser­vice as his own wait for a non-penalty goal since the open­ing day of the sea­son goes on. But Arteta said a draw at El­land Road was the best out­come for his team, who also lost Willian and sub­sti­tute Bukayo Saka to in­juries.</p>
    <p>“Con­sid­er­ing how early we got Pepe sent off, we have to take it,” he added. “I never like a draw but con­sid­er­ing the cir­cum­stances, it is a point.”</p>
    <p>Like Arsenal, the hosts also had re­grets from the match, al­though it was more to do with their way­ward fin­ish­ing.</p>
    <p>“We cer­tainly cre­ated enough chances and did enough to win it,” said Leeds mid­fielder Stu­art Dal­las. “The send­ing-off changed the game and we had a lot of possession. It is just un­for­tu­nate one of those chances we worked didn’t go in.”</p>
    <p>His man­ager Marcelo Bielsa said: “We’re frus­trated as we could have won the game. We tried to cre­ate dan­ger in dif­fer­ent ways, through the wings, long dis­tance and in a small sense through balls through the mid­dle.</p>
    <p>“In these three ways, we were able to cre­ate dan­ger but not able to con­vert.”</p>
