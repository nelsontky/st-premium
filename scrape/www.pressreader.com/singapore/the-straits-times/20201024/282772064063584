    <p>What is “re­gen­er­a­tive brak­ing” in the con­text of elec­tric and hy­brid ve­hi­cles? It sounds like a very com­plex type of brak­ing sys­tem and I am told that with EVs es­pe­cially, the brake pads last much longer than those in petrol or diesel ve­hi­cles. Why is this so?</p>
    <p>The elec­tric mo­tor used in hy­brid and elec­tric cars can also func­tion as an al­ter­na­tor to pro­duce elec­tric­ity. This fea­ture re­verses elec­tri­cal en­ergy flow from the mo­tor to the bat­tery.</p>
    <p>Even MRT trains use this to charge the on-board bat­ter­ies.</p>
    <p>For this to hap­pen, it is nec­es­sary to pro­vide some me­chan­i­cal in­put into the mo­tor for it to turn – just as elec­tri­cal en­ergy is con­verted to me­chan­i­cal en­ergy when the bat­tery sup­plies power to spin the mo­tor.</p>
    <p>When a car is at cruis­ing speed, it pos­sesses ki­netic en­ergy. Bring­ing the car’s speed back down to zero re­quires brak­ing, which in a con­ven­tional sys­tem in­volves brake pads ap­ply­ing fric­tion to discs at­tached to the wheels. The re­sult­ing heat is dis­si­pated (and wasted).</p>
    <p>In hy­brid and elec­tric cars, once the ac­cel­er­a­tor pedal is re­leased, the ve­hi­cle’s con­trol sys­tem en­gages the al­ter­na­tor func­tion.</p>
    <p>This means the driv­e­train now spins the mo­tor to pro­duce elec­tric­ity. This puts a load on the driv­e­train, cre­at­ing a sim­i­lar ef­fect as en­gine brak­ing to slow the car down. The amount of “en­gine brak­ing” can be var­ied in many elec­tric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>When the brake pedal is ap­plied, up to 70 per cent of the re­tar­da­tion can come from this con­ver­sion. This means the brakes them­selves have less work to do.</p>
    <p>This is why brake pads in a hy­brid can last at least twice as long as pads in a pure fos­sil fuel car, while those in an EV can last up to five times as long.</p>
