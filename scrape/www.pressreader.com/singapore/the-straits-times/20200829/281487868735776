    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump urged Amer­i­cans to re­turn him to of­fice for a sec­ond term, cham­pi­oning his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic while at­tack­ing his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den’s record on trade and China, as he ac­cepted the Repub­li­can Party’s nom­i­na­tion for re-election.</p>
    <p>Against a na­tional back­drop of racial jus­tice protests and un­rest in Wis­con­sin fol­low­ing the lat­est shoot­ing of a black man by a po­lice of­fi­cer, Mr Trump vowed to de­fend law and or­der against a “rad­i­cal left” bent on dis­man­tling Amer­ica’s way of life.</p>
    <p>“This election will de­cide whether we save the Amer­i­can dream or whether we al­low a so­cial­ist agenda to de­mol­ish our cher­ished des­tiny,” he said on Thurs­day in a speech that brought the four-day Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion to a close.</p>
    <p>“Your vote will de­cide whether we pro­tect law-abid­ing Amer­i­cans or whether we give free rein to vi­o­lent an­ar­chists and agi­ta­tors and crim­i­nals who threaten our cit­i­zens.”</p>
    <p>The end of the party na­tional con­ven­tions set the stage for Novem­ber’s election, which has shaped up to be a ref­er­en­dum on Mr Trump and his time in of­fice, and in par­tic­u­lar his han­dling of the Covid-19 cri­sis and anti-racism protests.</p>
    <p>He spoke for over an hour in front of 1,500 largely mask­less sup­port­ers seated close to­gether in front of the White House, in line with his ef­fort to por­tray, in his speech, Amer­ica as be­ing well past the worst of the virus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Vow­ing that the US would have a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine this year, he blamed China for let­ting the coro­n­avirus spread around the globe, say­ing: “They could have stopped it but they al­lowed it to come out.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent made no men­tion that the US had more than a quar­ter of the world’s coro­n­avirus cases and deaths, fo­cus­ing in­stead on Amer­ica’s na­tional mo­bil­i­sa­tion ef­forts and low case fa­tal­ity rates com­pared with else­where.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts have said the ra­tio of known Covid-19 cases to deaths may not ac­cu­rately re­flect a coun­try’s suc­cess at coun­ter­ing the virus, and that the US is do­ing badly by one ob­vi­ous count: its high death toll, which crossed the 180,000 mark this week.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s push to reopen the econ­omy, he said the shut­down which Mr Bi­den wanted would cause more drug over­doses, de­pres­sion, al­co­hol ad­dic­tion, sui­cides, heart at­tacks and economic dev­as­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“Joe Bi­den’s plan is not a so­lu­tion to the virus, but, rather, it’s a sur­ren­der to the virus,” said Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>At times, he cast him­self as an out­sider, re­count­ing how Washington in­sid­ers asked him “not to stand up to China”, while cas­ti­gat­ing Mr Bi­den’s record on in­ter­na­tional trade and ty­ing him to</p>
    <p>China’s rise and the hol­low­ing out of Amer­i­can man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den’s record is a shame­ful roll call of the most cat­a­strophic be­tray­als and blun­ders in our life­time,” said Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“He sup­ported China’s en­try into the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, one of the great­est economic dis­as­ters of all time... As vice-pres­i­dent, he sup­ported the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship which would have been a death sen­tence for the US auto in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump added that he would roll out tax cred­its to bring jobs out of China and back to the US, and im­pose tar­iffs on com­pa­nies that leave Amer­ica to pro­duce jobs over­seas.</p>
    <p>He briefly al­luded to the on­go­ing un­rest in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, amid protests over the shoot­ing of a 29-year-old black man, Mr Ja­cob Blake, by a po­lice of­fi­cer on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>But he did not men­tion 17-yearold Kyle Rit­ten­house, a Trump sup­porter who was charged with homi­cide in the fa­tal shoot­ing of two pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump broad­ened his com­ments into an at­tack on Democra­trun cities, ac­cus­ing them of not con­demn­ing more force­fully the vi­o­lence that has bro­ken out in some protests, al­though Mr Bi­den had in fact done so ear­lier on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said: “Joe Bi­den is weak. He takes his march­ing or­ders from lib­eral hyp­ocrites who drive their cities into the ground while flee­ing far from the scene of the wreck­age.</p>
    <p>“There’s vi­o­lence and dan­ger in the streets of many Demo­crat-run cities through­out Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“If the Demo­cratic Party wants to stand with an­ar­chists, agi­ta­tors, ri­ot­ers, loot­ers and flag burn­ers, that is up to them.”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing on Twit­ter, Mr Bi­den said: “Re­mem­ber: every ex­am­ple of vi­o­lence Don­ald Trump de­cries has hap­pened on his watch. Un­der his lead­er­ship. Dur­ing his pres­i­dency.”</p>
