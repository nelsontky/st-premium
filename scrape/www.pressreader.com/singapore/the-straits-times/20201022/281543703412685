    <p>Ni­cole Kid­man and Hugh Grant (both be­low) star in mys­tery thriller The Un­do­ing, which will dis­sect a pic­ture-per­fect mar­riage. It casts Kid­man as a wealthy New Yorker whose priv­i­leged life be­gins to crum­ble when her hus­band, played by Grant, is im­pli­cated in a mur­der. The Aus­tralian ac­tress says: “The great thing about this se­ries, and that re­ally drew me to it, is that it’s so twisty and noth­ing is what it seems.”</p>
    <p>A new mys­tery thriller star­ring Ni­cole Kid­man and Hugh Grant will scratch the sur­face of a pic­tureper­fect mar­riage to re­veal the se­crets and lies sim­mer­ing be­neath.</p>
    <p>Premier­ing next Mon­day at 9am on HBO Go and HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420), The Un­do­ing casts Kid­man as Grace, a wealthy New Yorker whose priv­i­leged life be­gins to crum­ble when her hus­band Jonathan, played by Grant, is im­pli­cated in a mur­der.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the cam­era are Emmy win­ners David E. Kel­ley (Big Lit­tle Lies, 2017 to 2019), who wrote the screenplay, and Su­sanne Bier (The Night Man­ager, 2016), who directed.</p>
    <p>At a press day in Los An­ge­les, the ac­tors and creators were care­ful not to give away spoil­ers, say­ing only that there is more to Grace and Jonathan than meets the eye.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the fact that Jonathan ini­tially comes across as the bad guy.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Grant ad­mits he en­joys such morally am­bigu­ous char­ac­ters, hav­ing achieved early ca­reer suc­cess by play­ing heart-throbs in ro­man­tic come­dies such as Love Ac­tu­ally (2003) and Four Wed­dings And A Funeral (1994).</p>
    <p>Even af­ter view­ers watch the first two episodes of The Un­do­ing, a six­part lim­ited se­ries, they will not know “whether I’m nice or nasty”, says the English star.</p>
    <p>“We have to be very care­ful in our an­swers be­cause this is a mys­tery and a who­dun­nit.”</p>
    <p>As for play­ing char­ac­ters “who aren’t de­light­ful”, Grant points out that he has “done noth­ing else, re­ally, for the last six years”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been con­sis­tently vile,” says the 60-year-old, who played an­tag­o­nists in an­i­mated com­edy Padding­ton 2 (2017) and pe­riod drama A Very English Scan­dal (2018), with the lat­ter earn­ing him a Golden Globe nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>And he prefers these roles. “It’s such a re­lief, I can’t tell you,” he quips. “Richard Cur­tis wrote a lot of those ro­man­tic come­dies I did, and it al­ways used to make him laugh that peo­ple thought Hugh was that nice, bum­bling English­man – be­cause he knew ex­actly the re­verse was true.</p>
    <p>“And it’s very nice to be closer to home.”</p>
    <p>For Kid­man – who won an Os­car for the biopic The Hours (2002) and an Emmy for Big Lit­tle Lies – the ap­peal of this story is how it keeps the au­di­ence guess­ing.</p>
    <p>“The great t hing about t his se­ries, and that re­ally drew me to it, is that it’s so twisty and noth­ing is what it seems,” says the Aus­tralian ac­tress, 53.</p>
    <p>“The theme of it is that choos­ing to ‘un-know’ things is a fas­ci­nat­ing part of hu­man na­ture – what you choose to be­lieve and what you choose to see. That’s the ba­sis of a lot of the psy­chol­ogy of this se­ries.”</p>
    <p>The story is also an un­com­fort­able ex­am­i­na­tion of a mar­riage, says the Moulin Rouge! (2001) star.</p>
    <p>“I love that this dis­sects a mar­riage and it re­ally digs right in. And you deal with these men that cir­cle my char­ac­ter and the way in which they in­ter­act with her, which is very in­ter­est­ing.”</p>
    <p>Fans of Kid­man and Kel­ley might see echoes of the last psy­cho­log­i­cal drama on which the pair col­lab­o­rated, the ac­claimed Big Lit­tle Lies, which also dealt with de­ceit and re­la­tion­ships in a well-heeled com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Kel­ley – who has won 11 Em­mys for se­ries such as Picket Fences (1992 to 1996) and The Prac­tice (1997 to 2004) – ac­knowl­edges some sim­i­lar­i­ties, but says this se­ries ex­plores the idea of delu­sional think­ing.</p>
    <p>The char­ac­ters, says the 64-yearold, “all had to draw false nar­ra­tives about who they were, who their part­ners were, who the peo­ple in their lives were – giv­ing rise to delu­sions that have a sur­pris­ing tenac­ity”.</p>
    <p>He adds: “We live in a world where the facts are the facts, but the story is bet­ter. And in re­la­tion­ships, that can be true as well.”</p>

    <p>The Un­do­ing will pre­miere next Mon­day at 9am on HBO Go and HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601, Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420).</p>
