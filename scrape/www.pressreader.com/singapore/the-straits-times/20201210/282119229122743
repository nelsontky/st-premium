    <p>Af­ter a ca­sual round of golf with friends one af­ter­noon in Oc­to­ber 2015, na­tional golfer Jen Goh, then 20, sud­denly found that she could not move her right arm at all.</p>
    <p>Over the next few weeks, the arm be­gan to swell and re­mained painful to move. But she did not know why – and nei­ther did more than 30 doc­tors she and her par­ents con­sulted over the next two years.</p>
    <p>That pe­riod of crip­pling un­cer­tainty was one of the low­est points of her life. Worse, it came dur­ing one of her best years of golf – “a blowout year”, said Ms Goh, now 25.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­pet­ing in the 2015 South-east Asian Games, where she clinched a bronze medal in the team event, she won sev­eral lo­cal events here – the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Am­a­teur Cham­pi­onship and the Sin­ga­pore Ladies’ Golf As­so­ci­a­tion Am­a­teur Open. It felt like she was well on her way to ful­fill­ing her dream of be­com­ing a golf pro.</p>
    <p>She had made sac­ri­fices to pur­sue that am­bi­tion, tak­ing the “un­con­ven­tional” route of leav­ing Sin­ga­pore in her first year of ju­nior col­lege to train. She had been home on a break from study­ing at a com­mu­nity col­lege in the United States when the in­jury oc­curred.</p>
    <p>She said: “I spent weeks as a spec­i­men, vis­it­ing one doc­tor af­ter an­other. Af­ter the first week, my mum in­sisted on check­ing me into the hospi­tal but I was dis­charged when they couldn’t fig­ure out what was wrong.”</p>
    <p>It was a bit­ter blow.</p>
    <p>“I felt that it was un­fair for this to hap­pen to me when I had put in more than my team­mates and com­peti­tors,” she said. “I watched my friends progress in life, while I was ly­ing in hospi­tal with noth­ing but a Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion cer­tifi­cate. I felt like I was stuck in a hole. I couldn’t play golf, and I couldn’t go to school be­cause I couldn’t use my arms.”</p>
    <p>One doc­tor sug­gested an am­pu­ta­tion, while oth­ers pre­scribed dif­fer­ent drugs. But de­spite their dire warn­ings that she would never play again, she was deter­mined to prove them wrong.</p>
    <p>In 2017, with­out a so­lu­tion to her pain, she de­cided to move to San Fran­cisco and pur­sue a de­gree in ki­ne­si­ol­ogy and psy­chol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“I was liv­ing on my own, man­ag­ing okay and try­ing to make a new start. But two months in, it hap­pened again and for nine weeks I couldn’t move my arm at all,” she said.</p>
    <p>A doc­tor she met by chance sug­gested she try ex­ploratory surgery to fig­ure out what was wrong with her arm. Surgery was an op­tion that had never been broached, said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>She found a doc­tor at Johns Hop­kins Hospi­tal who could do the pro­ce­dure – at a price tag of US$250,000 (S$334,000).</p>
    <p>Back home, her par­ents con­tacted a car­dio­vas­cu­lar sur­geon. “It was a stroke of luck – he was able to do it and it would be just $3,000 from my mum’s Medis­ave af­ter my health in­sur­ance (MediShield),” said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>She was di­ag­nosed with tho­racic out­let syn­drome, a con­di­tion that oc­curs when the blood ves­sels or nerves in the space be­tween the col­lar­bone and first rib – the tho­racic out­let – are com­pressed, caus­ing pain and numb­ness in the neck, shoul­der and arm.</p>
    <p>The sur­geon re­moved her first rib and two mus­cles on the right side of her body, which re­lieved the com­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral months later, she was back on the golf course prac­tis­ing and re­gain­ing her form.</p>
    <p>She won the stroke-play sec­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Am­a­teur Cham­pi­onship in 2018 and played on one of the big­gest stages of her life, a tele­vised Ladies Euro­pean Tour event in Oc­to­ber that year.</p>
    <p>“Life re­ally couldn’t change any faster – just a year be­fore that I had no idea what to do about my arm,” said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>She was also back on the na­tional golf team, though she had to deal with is­sues such as less range of mo­tion in her right arm post-surgery, as well as the fear that the con­di­tion would re­cur.</p>
    <p>In July last year, it did – this time in her left arm while she was play­ing a tour­na­ment in Europe. She came home and had surgery to re­move a rib on her left side.</p>
    <p>“These ex­pe­ri­ences have given me a lot of per­spec­tive. I know what I have over­come more than my com­peti­tors, and that gives me a men­tal edge,” said Ms Goh, who lives with her mother, Ms Ang Siew Yan, 54. Ms Ang was deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cap­i­taLand Fi­nan­cial be­fore she re­tired at 45, and now runs a milk and di­a­per pro­gramme at a char­ity.</p>
    <p>Her par­ents di­vorced when she was four years old.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh learnt to play golf in Pri­mary 5 when she ac­com­pa­nied her fa­ther, Mr Goh Kah Tong, 54, an en­tre­pre­neur, on his games.</p>
    <p>“Back when I got in­jured, I was ob­sessed with golf and worked way too hard. Now golf is not all I care about,” she added. “Golf is like life – you can never mas­ter it and ev­ery day it’s dif­fer­ent. It’s the most frus­trat­ing game in the world, like I’m al­ways chas­ing per­fec­tion but per­fec­tion can never be had.”</p>
    <p>Per­haps it also gave her insight into her con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Calvin Goh, 46, a friend and phys­io­ther­a­pist, said: “I see many ath­letes who un­dergo mul­ti­ple op­er­a­tions and are rar­ing to get back on the field. But Jen was very pa­tient about go­ing through the process slowly and get­ting through the ba­sics, to take a longterm view.”</p>
    <p>Ms Goh is now a third-year psy­chol­ogy and pub­lic pol­icy stu­dent at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity. She works part-time with phi­lan­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion The Ma­ju­rity Trust. She also co-founded Hope­full – an ini­tia­tive to en­cour­age chil­dren to chase their dreams in the arts, sports and mu­sic – with three friends dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It’s partly in­spired by what I went through. I hope that kids in sit­u­a­tions that might seem hope­less can re­main hope­ful and adopt a glass half-full way of look­ing at life,” said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>De­spite her other com­mit­ments, Ms Goh still dreams of turn­ing pro and is aim­ing to qual­ify for the 2024 Olympics.</p>
    <p>She trains reg­u­larly five to six times a week for about 35 hours at Tanah Merah Coun­try Club and Sen­tosa Golf Club.</p>
    <p>She said: “Now that I’m older and more ma­ture, it’s my own de­ci­sion to play. For three years no one but I be­lieved that I could play golf again, maybe not even my par­ents who lis­tened to the doc­tors – but my stub­born­ness saved me.”</p>
    <p>DE­FY­ING THE ODDS</p>
    <p>Now that I’m older and more ma­ture, it’s my own de­ci­sion to play. For three years no one but I be­lieved that I could play golf again, maybe not even my par­ents who lis­tened to the doc­tors – but my stub­born­ness saved me.</p>
