        Life Television | The Sunday Times Sunday, July 19, 2020 | C12 Though you may not feel you are at your best, you can still get started on something that turns out to be really great for you. Just make sure you do not let yourself get boxed in. March 21 - April 19 You can sense something is wrong before anyone can tell you and your intuition keeps tickling you with new informatio­n as the day goes on. April 20 - May 20 You may worry about your confusion, but it is not a big deal. Raw emotion is out in the open and you need to deal with it as it pops up. Everything should make sense tomorrow. May 21 - June 20 You have plenty of great energy, so make sure you are using every last bit of it. Things may get interestin­g towards the end of the day as you find others who need your help. June 21 - July 22 Let others take the spotlight. You have had your turn and you are feeling unusually reclusive. The people who count know you were responsibl­e for most of the success. July 23 - Aug 22 Try to help someone get organised. You never know when you need him or her to do something and it would be a shame if he or she is unable to help because of paperwork. Aug 23 - Sept 22 While the big picture may look a little gloomy or scary, you can still take pleasure from the small stuff. In fact, if you do so, you may glide right past this not-so-cool phase. Sept 23 - Oct 22 Let someone else make the big decisions. You need to relax and enjoy this pulse of great energy, and you will find yourself moving towards a much brighter tomorrow. Oct 23 - Nov 21 Your ability to change your tune is important. Someone needs to see that you are not as inflexible as he or she is afraid you might be. Let people see your open-minded side. Nov 22 - Dec 21 You are feeling nutty – up one moment, down the next. There is nothing wrong with that, as long as you can push forward and get past this emotional roller coaster. Dec 22 - Jan 19 Your ability to communicat­e with animals is heightened, but not in a weird way. You are just making sense of their oddball behaviour. C: Children; CA: Current Affairs;

A cutie turns your head and the odds are good that the feeling is mutual. Feb 19 - March 20 Programme schedules correct at time of printing. Telecast details from Mediacorp, StarHub and Singtel TV.
