    <p>Mr Goh was shocked be­yond be­lief when his wife of 11 years left home with their two young chil­dren last year and wanted a di­vorce.</p>
    <p>Even though they had fought over is­sues big and small, and their mar­riage had been on the rocks for years, the 41-year-old an­a­lyst never thought that she would leave him.</p>
    <p>“We have dif­fer­ent per­son­al­i­ties and per­spec­tives and our con­flicts were never re­solved,” he said. “Over time, we had less and less pa­tience for each other, and I gave her the cold shoul­der. When she sud­denly took the kids and left, I was very lost and de­pressed.”</p>
    <p>Mr Goh, who de­clined to give his full name, went for coun­selling – some­thing his wife had asked him to go for, but which he had brushed off ini­tially.</p>
    <p>He also took an on­line pro­gramme aimed at sal­vaging a mar­riage and picked up valu­able point­ers on how to bet­ter re­late to and com­mu­ni­cate with his wife.</p>
    <p>It worked, and his wife is giv­ing their mar­riage a sec­ond chance.</p>
    <p>Given his ex­pe­ri­ence, he is sug­gest­ing that the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) in­clude more con­tent on ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tion and con­flict res­o­lu­tion in its up­com­ing por­tal, which will pro­vide in­for­ma­tion and sup­port to cou­ples headed for di­vorce or who want help sav­ing their mar­riage.</p>
    <p>The MSF is in the midst of con­sult­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans who have di­vorced, or were on the brink of a break-up like Mr Goh, to bet­ter cus­tomise the con­tent for its yet-tobe-named por­tal, which is ex­pected to be launched late next year.</p>
    <p>The por­tal will con­sol­i­date in­for­ma­tion and re­sources re­lated to di­vorce, in­clud­ing hous­ing, fi­nance and le­gal mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it will of­fer self-as­sess­ment tools to help peo­ple bet­ter un­der­stand their mar­i­tal sit­u­a­tion and their chil­dren’s needs, and an on­line coun­selling sup­port ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Last month, MSF drew up an on­line ques­tion­naire to find out the needs of po­ten­tial users of the por­tal, and it had 113 re­spon­dents who had di­vorced or con­tem­plated end­ing their mar­riage.</p>
    <p>These re­spon­dents are in their 30s and 40s and all have chil­dren, an MSF spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MSF also sought feed­back from pro­fes­sion­als such as mar­riage coun­sel­lors.</p>
    <p>It is now in phase two of its cit­i­zen en­gage­ment ini­tia­tive and has had in-depth dis­cus­sions with about 60 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said: “The pre-di­vorce jour­ney is a deeply emotional and per­sonal one. The feed­back from par­tic­i­pants will be cru­cial to re­fine and nu­ance the ma­te­rial sen­si­tively so that it can prop­erly sup­port cou­ples in the painful pre-di­vorce space.</p>
    <p>“The feed­back will also sur­face gaps in the con­tent for fu­ture phases of de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>It has iden­ti­fied five cat­e­gories of cou­ples, based on their ex­pe­ri­ences of why their mar­riages failed. They in­clude those who had prob­lems right from the start, those whose unions crum­bled un­der the pres­sures of life, and cou­ples torn apart by adul­tery. There is also a group who want to save their mar­riages.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said: “We hope the por­tal will save as many mar­riages as pos­si­ble, but also – for what­ever rea­son that cou­ples choose to con­tinue with the di­vorce pro­ceed­ings – en­sure that they, and espe­cially their chil­dren, are well sup­ported.”</p>
    <p>SUP­PORT­ING COU­PLES AND CHIL­DREN</p>
    <p>We hope the por­tal will save as many mar­riages as pos­si­ble, but also... en­sure that they, and espe­cially their chil­dren, are well sup­ported.</p>
