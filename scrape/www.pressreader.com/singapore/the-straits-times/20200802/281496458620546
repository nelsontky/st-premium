    <p>“When you can’t change the di­rec­tion of the wind, ad­just your sails.”</p>
    <p>It was this quote, by Amer­i­can au­thor Har­ri­ett Jack­son Brown Jr, which kept Mr Wil­son Ho’s spir­its up and his mind open for more than a year after he was re­trenched in June 2017.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean says: “In­side my heart, I kept re­mind­ing my­self that as long as I kept ‘ad­just­ing my sails’ and adapt­ing, I would be able to find another job again.”</p>
    <p>He had pre­vi­ously in­stalled moor­ing equip­ment on oil rigs for more than seven years. The work of­ten re­quired him to be on-site over­seas, which meant many days away from his wife and two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But dur­ing an oil glut in the midto-late 2010s, oil prices fell and one day, Mr Ho was laid off after his com­pany was bought over by another firm.</p>
    <p>“I was given two months’ no­tice,” he re­calls. “But even then, I felt re­ally wor­ried and stressed. I feared I would not be able to find another ca­reer, as I was al­ready 54 years old then.”</p>
    <p>He faced many ob­sta­cles get­ting back into the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“I bought the news­pa­per ev­ery day and searched the ads for any job in the oil and gas in­dus­try,” he re­calls. “But there were very few po­si­tions as the in­dus­try was do­ing very poorly then.”</p>
    <p>Cast­ing his net wider, he gave jobs in other in­dus­tries a shot. He even tried for an op­er­a­tions man­ager po­si­tion in a fu­neral com­pany, but failed to land it.</p>
    <p>“I guess the hirer found some­one more suit­able,” he says.</p>
    <p>De­spite ap­ply­ing for new jobs al­most ev­ery day, he came up emp­ty­handed after a year.</p>
    <p>As his sav­ings dwin­dled, he came close to be­ing un­able to afford house­hold ne­ces­si­ties such as food and util­i­ties at one point.</p>
    <p>But he never lost hope. In 2018, he com­pleted a diploma in lead­er­ship and peo­ple man­age­ment from a pri­vate ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tute to up­grade him­self.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, he fi­nally hit pay­dirt when he an­swered an on­line job ad for a ware­house su­per­vi­sor po­si­tion at Win­spec Lo­gis­tics Ser­vices, a com­pany in Tuas which stores and dis­trib­utes goods such as food prod­ucts and me­chan­i­cal parts.</p>
    <p>Not only was he hired, but he was also given the higher po­si­tion of ware­house man­ager.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Kian Chin, the com­pany’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, says: “When we first met Wil­son dur­ing the in­ter­view, we were im­pressed with his pos­i­tive at­ti­tude. And tak­ing into ac­count his trans­fer­able skill sets such as his work ex­pe­ri­ence and man­age­ment skills, we de­cided to give him a chance and of­fered to take him on a higher-level job as a ware­house man­ager.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ho re­calls: “I felt very hon­oured to be given such an op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>After j oin­ing the com­pany i n Fe­bru­ary last year, he was placed in a nine-month lo­gis­tics pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme by Work­force Sin­ga­pore and the Sup­ply Chain and Lo­gis­tics Acad­emy. This course trains mid-ca­reer PMETs (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians) to help them gain a foothold in the sup­ply chain and lo­gis­tics in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Through it, Mr Ho learnt about the ins and outs of ware­hous­ing, from lo­gis­tics and trans­port man­age­ment to in­ven­tory con­trol and au­dit­ing.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the course, I re­mem­ber ask­ing a lot of ques­tions,” he says. “I wanted to make full use of this chance to start a brand new ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>Now 57, he has set­tled into his new job. Although he earns less than before, he ap­pre­ci­ates the sta­bil­ity of his cur­rent po­si­tion, which al­lows him more time with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>His advice to mid-ca­reer job seek­ers: “Don’t over­think. Grab any op­por­tu­ni­ties that come your way. There will be hur­dles to clear, but as long as you con­tinue to learn and build new skills, you can over­come them.”</p>
