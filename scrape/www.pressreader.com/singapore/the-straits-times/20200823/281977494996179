    <p>Dis­cus­sions on In­dian tele­vi­sion about the news never cease to shock view­ers.</p>
    <p>A woman panel­list was slapped on a live tele­cast in 2018. The fol­low­ing year, a glass of water was flung at a panel­list. Last month, a par­tic­u­larly shock­ing ex­ple­tive was blurted.</p>
    <p>On each oc­ca­sion, the In­dian tele­vi­sion news in­dus­try has done lit­tle to con­sider how it has aban­doned its core re­spon­si­bil­ity – de­liv­ery of the news – opt­ing in­stead for high­deci­bel toxic ver­bal du­els and mock tri­als that, while grab­bing eye­balls, plumb to new em­bar­rass­ing depths for jour­nal­ism every night.</p>
    <p>The new­est low comes with the ac­cu­sa­tion that its abra­sive na­ture may have caused the death of a spokesman for the op­po­si­tion Congress party, Mr Ra­jiv Tyagi, who died of a car­diac ar­rest on Aug 12 shortly after ap­pear­ing on a de­bate on Aaj Tak tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The ac­ri­mo­nious dis­cus­sion on re­cent com­mu­nal ri­ots in Ban­ga­lore saw him spar with his coun­ter­part from the rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He was seen gri­mac­ing and ap­peared vis­i­bly un­com­fort­able on screen.</p>
    <p>Mr Tyagi, who has ap­peared on many such tele­vi­sion shows, of­ten par­tic­i­pated in equal mea­sure in these slang­ing matches.</p>
    <p>But his death has prompted wide­spread calls for in­tro­spec­tion from politi­cians as well as me­dia per­son­al­i­ties, seek­ing an over­haul of how In­dian TV news shows are run.</p>
    <p>A day after Mr Tyagi’s death,</p>
    <p>Congress na­tional spokesman Jaiveer Shergill wrote to the gov­ern­ment ask­ing for an ad­vi­sory urg­ing me­dia houses to ad­here to the code of con­duct put out by the News Broad­cast­ing Stan­dard Author­ity (NBSA) in 2012.</p>
    <p>These widely flouted norms re­quire an­chors not to make “deroga­tory” or “de­ri­sive” state­ments and chan­nels to en­sure that panel dis­cus­sions do not spread “ac­ri­mony”.</p>
    <p>Mr Shergill told The Sunday Times that his let­ter was an at­tempt to high­light “the sheer level of tox­i­c­ity, slan­der and sen­sa­tion­al­ism” in live In­dian tele­vi­sion pro­grammes and to seek in­sti­tu­tional re­form.</p>
    <p>“It is also a knock on the door to save the in­tegrity of these so-called reg­u­la­tory au­thor­i­ties so that they act on vi­o­la­tions of their own guide­lines,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Par­ties across po­lit­i­cal lines, as well as view­ers, need to pon­der about our par­tic­i­pa­tion (in these chan­nels),” he added.</p>
    <p>Over the years, some party spokes­men, in­clud­ing from the Congress, have stayed away from cer­tain chan­nels, but this has had no ef­fect on their view­er­ship.</p>
    <p>At an NBSA hear­ing con­ducted on­line last Wednes­day, Mr Shergill and his party col­leagues sought clar­ity on what con­sti­tutes ac­ri­mo­nious be­hav­iour. Tac­tics such as re­duc­ing the mi­cro­phone vol­ume of cer­tain par­tic­i­pants so that they can be out­shouted, de­lib­er­ately im­bal­anced pan­els and an­chors act­ing as “cat­a­lysts of provo­ca­tion rather than ref­er­ees” should clearly be iden­ti­fied as ac­ri­mo­nious, said Mr Shergill, a Supreme Court lawyer.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jat Sharma, pres­i­dent of the News Broad­cast­ers As­so­ci­a­tion that set up the NBSA for the in­dus­try’s self-reg­u­la­tion, did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The harsh truth is that these de­bates, de­spite their un­savoury fall­out, have gen­er­ated high view­er­ship num­bers.</p>
    <p>“The worse the re­al­ity show, the more the traf­fic and au­di­ence you get, but you really can’t blame peo­ple for want­ing to be en­ter­tained,” said Mr Ab­hi­nan­dan Sekhri, co­founder of Newslaun­dry, a sub­scriber-driven me­dia cri­tique and cur­rent af­fairs por­tal.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tory bodies could con­sider is­su­ing ad­vi­sories to ad­ver­tis­ers ask­ing them not to sup­port pro­grammes with hate­ful con­tent.</p>
    <p>“But will that work and will there be a con­sen­sus? I doubt it,” he told The Sunday Times, call­ing for a trans­par­ent ca­ble TV dis­tri­bu­tion model that al­lows tele­vi­sion chan­nels to gen­er­ate more rev­enue from sub­scribers in­stead of ad­ver­tis­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Nalin Satyakam Kohli, a Supreme Court ad­vo­cate and BJP na­tional spokesman, said that at­tempts to po­lice news dis­cus­sions are un­de­sir­able, given that even what may be ex­pressed un­der Ar­ti­cle 19 of the In­dian Con­sti­tu­tion, which guar­an­tees free­dom of speech and ex­pres­sion, is yet to be set­tled.</p>
    <p>“In such a con­text, when what we can speak is still be­ing de­bated, can we reg­u­late how we are to speak,” added Mr Kohli, a former tele­vi­sion news pre­sen­ter who sug­gested that self-reg­u­la­tion is the only pos­si­ble so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Many in In­dia have op­posed me­dia reg­u­la­tion by the gov­ern­ment, fear­ing it may amount to cen­sor­ship.</p>
