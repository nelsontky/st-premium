    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • When vet­eran Hol­ly­wood ac­tor Gregg Daniel was of­fered an au­di­tion for a new movie in Los An­ge­les, he nearly did not show up – the pan­demic was well un­der way and “no one was shoot­ing”.</p>
    <p>“I al­most hes­i­tated even go­ing to the au­di­tion,” he said. “I’m African-Amer­i­can, I’m over 50, and dis­pro­por­tion­ately, black peo­ple were dy­ing of Covid-19, but the script was so good and I’m an ac­tor at heart.”</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward to to­day and Daniel has com­pleted box­ing drama 7th & Union, filmed in the streets of the eerily quiet Cal­i­for­nian en­ter­tain­ment cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Thanks to re­lent­less test­ing, on­set “Covid-19 of­fi­cers”, san­i­ta­tion sta­tions and en­forced so­cial dis­tanc­ing be­tween takes, “every­thing went smoothly” and safely, said ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Jo­lene Ro­driguez.</p>
    <p>Yet it is one of just a hand­ful of film pro­duc­tions to re­sume in Hol­ly­wood since Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som gave the green light back in June. Health fears, un­cer­tainty and a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus cases have meant few movie pro­duc­ers brav­ing a re­turn so far – with some head­ing else­where or even overseas.</p>
    <p>No state in the United States has suf­fered more than Cal­i­for­nia, which has so far recorded more than 620,000 coro­n­avirus cases, in­clud­ing more than 11,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>The main hold-up for movie stu­dios is talks be­tween em­ploy­ers and unions to agree on a new set of stan­dard, in­dus­try-wide safety pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been work­ing on it for many, many weeks. There are a lot of com­pli­cated is­sues,” said Mr Dun­can Crab­tree-Ire­land, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of ac­tors guild SAG-Aftra, which has joined forces with Hol­ly­wood’s di­rec­tors, tech­ni­cians and Team­sters unions.</p>
    <p>Among dis­cus­sions are daily test­ing for ac­tors per­form­ing “the more dan­ger­ous work from a Covid-19 per­spec­tive”, such as intimate sex or fight scenes.</p>
    <p>Once ne­go­ti­a­tions are com­pleted – a deal is ex­pected by next month – the ma­jor prob­lem of coro­n­avirus in­sur­ance per­sists. The cost of restart­ing a pro­duc­tion only to shut down again due to an out­break is so high that in­sur­ers are ex­clud­ing Covid-19-re­lated claims from new poli­cies.</p>
    <p>For now, the trickle of film pro­duc­tions go­ing ahead needs to be ap­proved by unions on a case-by­case ba­sis. A “cot­tage in­dus­try of bou­tique test­ing com­pa­nies” have sprung up to ser­vice film sets that can­not af­ford in-house test­ing, said</p>
    <p>Mr Crab­tree-Ire­land.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, pro­duc­ers have learnt to be cre­ative about film­ing lo­ca­tions, with busy pub­lic ar­eas not fea­si­ble, said FilmLA pres­i­dent Paul Aud­ley. “Writ­ers are re­ally clever – so we know some of the shows may be writ­ing for ar­eas that are more iso­lated, like an in­dus­trial area.”</p>
    <p>An­other far riskier ap­proach has sprung up – film­ing without per­mis­sion at all.</p>
    <p>“Right now, the No. 1 com­plaint that we’ve had on the books is for il­le­gal film­ing,” said Mr Aud­ley, adding that coro­n­avirus-wary Los An­ge­les res­i­dents are more vig­i­lant than ever in re­port­ing guer­rilla shoots.</p>
    <p>Still, de­spite the growth of other film­ing hubs, such as the state of Ge­or­gia – where mogul Tyler Perry has set up a self-con­tained, 133ha pro­duc­tion “cam­pus” – many film­mak­ers ap­pear deter­mined to re­main in Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>“Our mem­bers pre­fer to work close to home and I think es­pe­cially in times of un­cer­tainty like this, they feel more com­fort­able,” said Mr Crab­tree-Ire­land. “In terms of what the prospects for Los An­ge­les are, I wouldn’t sug­gest any­one should count LA out.”</p>
