    <p>NEW YORK • Ser­ena Wil­liams, Vic­to­ria Azarenka and Tsve­tana Pironkova made up a “Band of Moth­ers” who marched into the third round of the US Open on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The trio were part of a clus­ter of nine mums who started this week’s women’s sin­gles tour­na­ment at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>Six of the nine – Kim Cli­jsters, Vera Zvonareva, Tat­jana Maria, Kateryna Bon­darenko, Pa­tri­cia Maria Tig and Olga Govortsova – have been elim­i­nated.</p>
    <p>But the un­ranked Bul­gar­ian Pironkova – play­ing her first tour­na­ment in three years af­ter a break to have her first child – pro­longed her stay with a 7-5, 6-3 up­set of Span­ish 10th seed Gar­bine Mugu­ruza.</p>
    <p>For­mer world No. 1 Wil­liams also ad­vanced with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Rus­sia’s Margarita Gas­paryan.</p>
    <p>Pironkova and Wil­liams were later joined by Azarenka, an­other for­mer world No. 1 who beat fel­low Be­laru­sian and fifth seed Aryna Sa­balenka 6-1, 6-3.</p>
    <p>Pironkova, who gave birth to her son Alexan­der in April 2018, says moth­er­hood has given her a new per­spec­tive on her ten­nis ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing is the same re­ally,” she said. “Right now I’m just happy to be play­ing... It’s just great to be play­ing with­out that ex­tra pres­sure that I had on my­self be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore, it was like al­most life­and-death sit­u­a­tion for me to win a match. Right now it’s just en­joy­ment to be on the court.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously there’s a lot of chal­lenges, and pri­or­i­ties would al­ways be my son and my fam­ily and their health and hap­pi­ness...</p>
    <p>“But if you make a good sched­ule, if you re­ally have the right mo­ti­va­tion, I guess you can com­bine the two things – moth­er­hood and be­ing a pro­fes­sional ten­nis player.”</p>
    <p>Only three women – Cli­jsters, Evonne Goolagong and Mar­garet Court – have won Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tles in the Open era af­ter hav­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Azarenka, mean­while, said she hoped she could help in­spire work­ing par­ents ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>“Pretty in­cred­i­ble, right?” she said when asked to com­ment on the nine moth­ers who started the tour­na­ment. “There is a lot that goes into it in terms of bal­anc­ing, a lot of things, and jug­gling two things.</p>
    <p>“But iden­ti­fy­ing my­self or other play­ers just as moth­ers, I think that’s not the only thing that we are. We are also ten­nis play­ers. We are also women who have dreams and goals and pas­sions.</p>
    <p>“I think to see that rise of women be­ing able to ful­fil their dreams, as well as bal­anc­ing the moth­er­hood, I think they all are he­roes.”</p>
