    <p>There were 242 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed at noon yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 54,797.</p>
    <p>They in­clude a 67-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who was de­tected un­der en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing for those aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute re­s­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion at first pre­sen­ta­tion to a doc­tor. He is not linked to other cases.</p>
    <p>Such test­ing al­lows for quick iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of in­fected per­sons early to con­tain fur­ther spread, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said, adding that in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress.</p>
    <p>There were also six im­ported cases who had been placed on stay­home notices upon ar­rival, said</p>
    <p>MOH. They com­prise a Sin­ga­porean and a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who were re­turn­ing home, two work pass hold­ers who are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, a de­pen­dant’s pass holder and a longterm visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>They all ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia be­tween July 25 and 27. All were placed on 14-day stay­home notices upon ar­rival, and were tested while serv­ing their notices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 235 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A new coro­n­avirus clus­ter – a dor­mi­tory at 66 Tech Park Cres­cent in Tuas – was an­nounced yes­ter­day. The clus­ter is linked to four pre­vi­ous cases, said MOH.</p>
    <p>It is the first clus­ter to be an­nounced since July 27, when a new case was linked to four pre­vi­ous cases, form­ing a clus­ter at a dorm at Sungei Kadut Street 2.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also up­dated that the In­ter-agency Task­force has com­pleted the test­ing of all work­ers in the dor­mi­to­ries, ex­cept for a few stand­alone blocks in the dorms that serve as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The work­ers in these quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties will be tested when their iso­la­tion ends, and we ex­pect the case counts to re­main high in the com­ing days, be­fore ta­per­ing down there­after,” MOH added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Golden Vil­lage cin­ema at Jurong Point, ABC Brick­works Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre in Jalan Bukit Merah, Tang Tea House in Jurong West and the Sheng Siong su­per­mar­ket at Wood­lands In­dus­trial Park were added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited them for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>It said the av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from three cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 281 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 48,297 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 124 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 6,334 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes. Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected over 19.2 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 719,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
