    <p>For a long time, gym­nas­tics was a game of num­bers for Kathryn Chia.</p>
    <p>On the com­pe­ti­tion floor, scores were an in­di­ca­tion of her abil­ity. Off it, the fig­ures on the weigh­ing scale deter­mined the former rhyth­mic gym­nast’s self-worth.</p>
    <p>At 14, Kathryn’s daily diet com­prised six grapes for break­fast, 20 baby spinach leaves and three mush­rooms for lunch, and half a cup of milk for din­ner. Meals with fam­ily and friends be­came a dreaded af­fair for her be­cause she was afraid that they would ask her to eat more than she wanted to.</p>
    <p>Her in­se­cu­ri­ties about her body were fur­ther com­pounded by coaches who con­stantly re­marked on her body. One was a former coach in the na­tional rhyth­mic gym­nas­tics set-up – Kathryn spent about six weeks last year at the na­tional train­ing cen­tre – who con­tin­u­ally stressed the need to be slim.</p>
    <p>Kathryn, now 16, said: “I was feel­ing par­tic­u­larly self-con­scious and we were be­ing pres­sured to lose weight.</p>
    <p>“Not only did it hurt me men­tally be­cause I was al­ways com­par­ing my­self to oth­ers and think­ing about what I would eat and com­ing to train­ing feel­ing a bit self-con­scious, it re­ally took away my pas­sion for the sport.”</p>
    <p>Want­ing to start con­ver­sa­tions about this topic in the gym­nas­tics com­mu­nity, Kathryn, who moved to Eng­land to study in Septem­ber, pub­lished a post about how she and 15 other lo­cal gym­nasts strug­gled with body im­age is­sues on her web­site, Apothe-Kathryn.</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­pore gym­nast, who de­clined to be named, re­sorted to eating a fruit a day out of fear that she would be pun­ished by her coach in school for not los­ing weight.</p>
    <p>Such pun­ish­ments in­cluded be­ing forced to is­sue an apol­ogy and ex­er­cis­ing till the point that she felt faint.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Gym­nas­tics gen­eral man­ager Karen Nor­den yes­ter­day em­pha­sised the as­so­ci­a­tion does not tol­er­ate body-sham­ing and said it has been work­ing with the Sin­ga­pore Sport In­sti­tute and the Na­tional Youth Sports In­sti­tute to come up with pro­grammes to ed­u­cate par­ents, ath­letes and coaches.</p>
    <p>She added: “There is still some hes­i­ta­tion for these types of things to be dis­cussed and even brought to our at­ten­tion.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ing body has five safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers, with two as­signed to mon­i­tor ath­letes at the na­tional train­ing cen­tre daily. It also plans to hire an ath­letes’ health per­for­mance man­ager to over­see its gym­nasts and will con­duct sur­veys with ath­letes to bet­ter un­der­stand their con­cerns.</p>
    <p>ATH­LETES FI­NALLY SPEAK UP</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, gym­nasts world­wide have bro­ken their si­lence on the abuse they en­dured dur­ing their ca­reers. The re­lease of Net­flix doc­u­men­tary Ath­lete A and the #Gym­nastAl­liance move­ment this year have played a huge role in em­bold­en­ing ath­letes glob­ally to come for­ward. The film de­tails how former USA Gym­nas­tics doc­tor Larry Nas­sar abused the girls and young women in his care and how the as­so­ci­a­tion hid his mis­deeds.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, former na­tional women’s artis­tic gym­nas­tics head coach Ger­rit Belt­man ad­mit­ted to a Dutch news­pa­per in July to hav­ing pre­vi­ously “mis­treated and hu­mil­i­ated young gym­nasts to win medals” prior to his ap­point­ment at Sin­ga­pore Gym­nas­tics in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man re­signed from his post that same month to re­turn to the Nether­lands to be with his fam­ily but told The Straits Times that he wants to be ac­count­able and not be the per­son and coach he once was and that he hoped to contribute to the process of change.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the spate of abuse scan­dals, the In­ter­na­tional Gym­nas­tics Fed­er­a­tion (FIG) held a con­fer­ence last month aimed at chang­ing the prac­tices in the sport and im­prov­ing ath­lete safety.</p>
    <p>The re­ports in­spired those out­side gym­nas­tics too, with former na­tional fig­ure skater Yu Shu­ran, a 2017 SEA Games gold medal­list, com­ing for­ward to re­veal the hor­rific prac­tices that were part of her prac­tice reg­i­men while she was train­ing in China.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes in sports that fo­cus heav­ily on how one looks are at a higher risk of de­vel­op­ing body im­age is­sues, said sports psy­chol­o­gist Edgar Tham from SportPsych Con­sult­ing.</p>
    <p>He added: “Un­for­tu­nately, that’s what the cul­ture of the sport prop­a­gates – if you fit in, you’ll be able to stay. If you don’t, you either find a way to fit or drop out.”</p>
    <p>HOW TO AP­PROACH WEIGHT-RE­LATED IS­SUES</p>
    <p>Na­tional syn­chro­nised swim­mer Deb­bie Soh, who spoke to ST ear­lier this year about her strug­gles with body im­age, un­der­stands what it is like to deal with the pres­sures that Kathryn faced.</p>
    <p>“When we join the sport, we don’t ex­pect that this is what comes with it,” said Soh, 22, and a five-gold SEA Games cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“Pu­berty changes your body a lot and a lot of girls don’t know how to deal with it. Some­times coaches don’t re­alise that young girls are very in­se­cure about their bod­ies, es­pe­cially when it’s chang­ing.”</p>
    <p>Coaches ST spoke to em­pha­sised the need to ap­proach weight-re­lated is­sues care­fully.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Karpenko, founder and head coach of Karpenko Gym­nas­tics Academy here, de­scribed the sit­u­a­tion as hugely dis­ap­point­ing.</p>
    <p>The two-time Rus­sian rhyth­mic gym­nas­tics na­tional cham­pion, 33, said: “I have seen it my­self when com­pet­ing and coach­ing over 30 years in the sport and not enough progress seems to have been made. Some girls are nat­u­rally leaner than oth­ers and it is heart­break­ing to see those who are not so be­ing tar­geted by coaches.”</p>
    <p>Cher­rie Kwek, Releve Rhyth­mic Gym­nas­tics Academy head coach and founder, does not pres­sure any of the gym­nasts she coaches to lose weight, but has seen sev­eral young gym­nasts re­sort to dras­tic mea­sures to do so.</p>
    <p>Although the rea­son be­hind it may not al­ways be linked to the sport, the 29-year-old and former na­tional gym­nast be­lieves it is cru­cial for coaches to in­ter­vene quickly in such sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Former na­tional artis­tic gym­nast Lim Heem Wei, who is now a coach at Sin­ga­pore Gym­nas­tics, noted the im­por­tance of be­ing tact­ful when ap­proach­ing weight-re­lated is­sues as dif­fer­ent ath­letes may per­ceive the same re­mark dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>In some cases, Lim, the coun­try’s first gym­nast to com­pete at the Olympics, said she would talk to the par­ent in­stead of rais­ing the mat­ter di­rectly with the ath­lete. A di­eti­tian or nu­tri­tion­ist and psy­chol­o­gist may also be in­volved in the process to make sure the ath­lete’s well-be­ing is taken care of.</p>
    <p>With weight and body im­age is­sues just two of the deep-seated prob­lems that plague the sport world­wide, the 31-year-old be­lieves a par­a­digm shift is re­quired.</p>
    <p>“It needs to be a cul­ture across the en­tire na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion to make sure there is aware­ness and ed­u­ca­tion. It’s not a one­off thing – it has to be con­stant, it has to be very struc­tured so that it be­comes the norm,” she said.</p>
    <p>Tham, who has ac­com­pa­nied the Sin­ga­pore con­tin­gent to ma­jor sports events like the Olympics and Asian Games, said that if not dealt with prop­erly, neg­a­tive body im­age could lead to ath­letes de­vel­op­ing eating dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>“Some­times it’s so sub­tle that they don’t even know,” he added.</p>
    <p>There could also be ad­verse ef­fects on the ath­lete’s men­tal health as they may ex­pe­ri­ence so­cial physique anx­i­ety, which makes them ex­tremely self-con­scious around oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Tham said: “There could be ath­letes who are suf­fer­ing in si­lence with­out know­ing that oth­ers are go­ing through the same thing. There’s the need to raise aware­ness to watch out for signs, symp­toms or cer­tain mind­sets that helps them to put a red flag to things if they see some­thing.”</p>
    <p>NO MORE FUN</p>
    <p>Not only did it hurt me men­tally be­cause I was al­ways com­par­ing my­self to oth­ers and think­ing about what I would eat and com­ing to train­ing feel­ing a bit self-con­scious, it re­ally took away my pas­sion for the sport.</p>

    <p>END­ING THE SI­LENCE</p>
    <p>There is still some hes­i­ta­tion for these types of things to be dis­cussed and even brought to our at­ten­tion.</p>

    <p>ALL-ROUND EF­FORT</p>
    <p>It needs to be a cul­ture across the en­tire na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion to make sure there is aware­ness and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>LIM HEEM WEI, former Sin­ga­pore gym­nast.</p>
    <p>SPEAK OUT MORE</p>
    <p>There could be ath­letes who are suf­fer­ing in si­lence with­out know­ing that oth­ers are go­ing through the same thing.</p>
