    <p>In his six years work­ing at Grand Hy­att Sin­ga­pore, Mr Naidu Than­a­bal never imag­ined the day when the bustling five-star would be empty.</p>
    <p>Yet, like all ho­tels, that is what hap­pened in the weeks af­ter the pan­demic hit Sin­ga­pore in Jan­uary, and tourist ar­rivals nose­dived.</p>
    <p>But pes­simism soon turned into pos­i­tiv­ity. Mr Naidu and his col­leagues im­me­di­ately rolled out safety mea­sures such as daily tem­per­a­ture checks for staff and guests, and more fre­quent clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion of high-touch ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Quick ac­tion to clean its premises and a com­mit­ment to keep guests safe led to the ho­tel be­com­ing one of the first in Sin­ga­pore to at­tain an SG Clean cer­ti­fi­ca­tion on March 12.</p>
    <p>The SG Clean mark is a bill of health for tourism, re­tail and food ser­vice busi­nesses that meet re­quire­ments tai­lored to each sec­tor. They in­clude the ap­point­ment of an SG Clean man­ager to over­see the estab­lish­ment’s prac­tices and fre­quent dis­in­fec­tion of com­mon fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It was a heavy re­spon­si­bil­ity for Mr Naidu, 56, the ho­tel’s hy­giene and safety man­ager and SG Clean man­ager. His pri­or­ity was to en­sure its rapid re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways em­pha­sise the im­por­tance of keep­ing our hands clean as we’re touch­ing a lot of things, es­pe­cially now with the coron­avirus,” he said.</p>
    <p>Staff were al­ready us­ing hands-free soap dis­pensers and hand sani­tiser be­fore the pan­demic reached Sin­ga­pore, but Mr Naidu felt it was cru­cial to step up safety and hy­giene train­ing.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary, Grand Hy­att Sin­ga­pore staff have un­der­gone seven to eight on­line cour­ses on top­ics such as blood­borne pathogens, safe man­age­ment mea­sures and the proper use of chem­i­cals in clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Wel­come and well­ness</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is paying off. Busi­ness is pick­ing up for the ho­tel fol­low­ing ap­proval from the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) to fully re­sume oper­a­tions last month.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel’s mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager Gerald Kheng said there has been a steady in­crease in room book­ings since it launched its stay­ca­tion pack­ages on July 14.</p>
    <p>Be­fore get­ting the green light to wel­come guests, ho­tels must ad­here to a strin­gent set of safe man­age­ment mea­sures drawn up by STB, En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try and the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>These in­clude oc­cu­pancy lim­its per room, stag­gered tim­ings for guests at the ho­tel lobby and guest fa­cil­i­ties, im­ple­men­ta­tion of SafeEn­try and rig­or­ous clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion of high-touch ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Grand Hy­att Sin­ga­pore is among 17 7 ho­tels that have been ap­proved by STB for stay­ca­tions as of Aug 2. Its quick come­back is no­table be­cause it was among sev­eral lo­cal clus­ters iden­ti­fied in the early days of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Front of­fice as­sis­tant man­ager Bram­etha Parime­lala­gan said that the guest ex­pe­ri­ence at Grand Hy­att Sin­ga­pore seems largely un­af­fected by these ad­di­tional mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“The changes seem sig­nif­i­cant, but I would say that our guests are fa­mil­iar with the mea­sures in place.”</p>
    <p>She added that most lo­cal guests are used to the SafeEn­try checkpoint­s, tem­per­a­ture screen­ing, hand sanitising and wear­ing a mask in pub­lic spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Still, there are some who have trou­ble get­ting used to the mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“Some guests are not very keen on SafeEn­try and find the mul­ti­ple scan­ning of QR codes in­con­ve­nient,” she said.</p>
    <p>To ease their con­cerns, her team ex­plains the pro­ce­dures and as­sists guests who need help.</p>
    <p>She ex­plained: “These mea­sures are very im­por­tant for our guests and help en­sure that we pro­vide a safe and healthy en­vi­ron­ment for ev­ery­one. Our pri­or­ity is al­ways the health and well-be­ing of our guests and we should not com­pro­mise on that.”</p>
