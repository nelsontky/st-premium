    <p>The eco­nomic fall­out from Covid-19 has af­fected not just the most vul­ner­a­ble work­ers, but also a broad swathe of the mid­dle class around the world.</p>
    <p>This means re­ly­ing on tra­di­tional so­lu­tions to in­equal­ity, such as pas­sive and re­dis­tribu­tive mea­sures, “is not go­ing to change the game”, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Tharman Shanmugara­tnam.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it is im­por­tant to in­vest in ed­u­ca­tion and pub­lic goods that will create new jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties, as well as a sense of op­ti­mism, he added when speak­ing on a panel on the topic, A New Deal For Work­ers, at the Bloomberg New Econ­omy Fo­rum on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The four-day fo­rum, a virtual gath­er­ing of busi­ness and po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, cov­ers fi­nance, trade, cli­mate, health and cities.</p>
    <p>The other pan­el­lists were Mc</p>
    <p>Don­ald’s pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Chris Kem­pczin­ski, IBM ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Ginni Rometty, and Black­stone co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Stephen Sch­warz­man. The ses­sion was mod­er­ated by Bloomberg Quick­take chief cor­re­spon­dent Ja­son Kelly.</p>
    <p>Mr Tharman, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies, said that in many ad­vanced so­ci­eties, there has been a loss of the sense that one can “move up in the old way”.</p>
    <p>“If you started off from the bot­tom, you ac­tu­ally had a chance of a mid­dle-class life and there was a path­way,” he said.</p>
    <p>“That hope, that set of as­pi­ra­tions, is now di­min­ished.”</p>
    <p>Covid-19 can be tack­led in ways that ad­dress th­ese longer-term prob­lems, he said.</p>
    <p>He cited two ma­jor in­ter­ven­tions that are needed.</p>
    <p>First, there must be in­vest­ment in life­long learn­ing and ed­u­ca­tion, which cre­ates a pos­i­tive and self-re­in­forc­ing spi­ral of learn­ing, skills ac­cu­mu­la­tion and job pro­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, there ought to be a new era of in­vest­ments in pub­lic goods – from ba­sic sci­ence and re­search and de­vel­op­ment, to train­ing and in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>This in­volves re-fo­cus­ing bud­gets and fis­cal pol­icy in a way that will broaden op­por­tu­ni­ties and job growth, which in turn will create a sense of op­ti­mism that unites peo­ple, he said.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing with Mr Tharman’s point on ed­u­ca­tion, IBM’s Ms Rometty said com­pa­nies can open up new path­ways for peo­ple that do not re­quire a tra­di­tional univer­sity de­gree.</p>
    <p>This re­quires a par­a­digm shift among em­ploy­ers, like hir­ing us­ing a skills-first ap­proach in­stead of over-em­pha­sis­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tions, she added. “To­day, 40 per cent of IBM’s job re­quire­ments no longer re­quire a four-year de­gree.”</p>
    <p>Black­stone’s Mr Sch­warz­man said the busi­ness com­mu­nity must be deeply en­gaged in the school sys­tem, like pro­vid­ing ap­pren­tice­ships: “If (peo­ple) are linked into the busi­ness com­mu­nity, they’ll have a place to go to work and be taught in­creas­ing levels of skills.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kem­pczin­ski noted how McDon­ald’s has had to work out mul­ti­ple ca­reer and train­ing path­ways for its em­ploy­ees, from restau­rant man­agers to fran­chisees.</p>
    <p>Mr Tharman said there is a need to move away from a di­chotomy that has de­fined labour mar­kets for too long – one that dis­tin­guishes be­tween tra­di­tional aca­dem­i­cally-ori­ented grad­u­ates, and those who went through a tech­ni­cal ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s in­ef­fi­cient. It’s not as if the mar­ket ac­tu­ally re­quired this, it was largely a job sig­nalling de­vice,” he said, adding that the prac­tice of us­ing al­go­rithms in hir­ing has re­in­forced the pref­er­ence for cre­den­tials. This is an area where the new gen­er­a­tion of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tools can help, he said, as they can identify, based on a per­son’s ca­reer his­tory, the trans­fer­able skills that he or she has ac­cu­mu­lated along the way.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity for most blue-col­lar work­ers world­wide is that they move from one job to another with­out ac­cu­mu­lat­ing skills or hu­man cap­i­tal the way highly-skilled pro­fes­sion­als do, Mr Tharman added.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to use tech­nolo­gies, top man­age­ment at­ti­tudes and new so­cial norms to think dif­fer­ently about blue-col­lar work­ers and or­di­nary white-col­lar work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Think of them as hu­man cap­i­tal... see them as peo­ple whose hopes and as­pi­ra­tions are achieved be­cause they are in­vested in, and they them­selves rise to the oc­ca­sion,” he said.</p>
