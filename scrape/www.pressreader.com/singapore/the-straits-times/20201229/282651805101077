    <p>• K-pop singer Taeyeon may have a new love in her life – rap­per Ravi.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, South Korean web­site Joynews24 re­ported that Taeyeon, 31, and Ravi, 27, have been dat­ing for about a year after get­ting to know each other through a mu­tual friend who is a mem­ber of a girl group.</p>
    <p>Taeyeon, whose full name is Kim Tae-yeon, is the leader of pop­u­lar girl group Girls’ Gen­er­a­tion, while Ravi, whose real name is Kim Won-sik, is a mem­ber of boy band VIXX.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Taeyeon’s agency SM En­ter­tain­ment said only that they be­came close after work­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ravi’s agency GROOVL1N con­firmed they were dat­ing, but later changed its tune and de­nied that the two are a cou­ple.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the de­nial, Joynews24 re­leased a video show­ing the two singers spend­ing three days and two nights to­gether over the Christ­mas week­end.</p>
    <p>Both singers have so far not re­acted di­rectly to the re­port, but on Sun­day, Taeyeon posted a screen­shot of va­ri­ety show DoReMi Market (2018 to present) fea­tur­ing the ex­pres­sion of Key from boy group Shinee, with the words “Pic­ture to be used when you are en­dur­ing for a long time”.</p>
    <p>Taeyeon pre­vi­ously dated EXO’s Baekhyun, while Ravi was once ro­man­ti­cally linked to Hyuna of Won­der Girls and 4Minute.</p>
    <p>There had been signs that Taeyeon and Ravi might be close.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, Ravi in­vited Taeyeon on his pro­gramme Ques­tion Mark to pro­mote her new song What Do I Call You.</p>
    <p>He has ap­peared as a fre­quent guest on DoReMi Market after Taeyeon joined the show re­cently.</p>
