    <p>AM­S­TER­DAM The Dutch Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture yes­ter­day or­dered the culling of 200,000 chick­ens af­ter highly path­o­genic bird flu was found at a farm in the east­ern town of Pui­flijk.</p>
    <p>The cull, which in­cludes birds at a sec­ond farm within a 1km ra­dius, is the sec­ond in the coun­try within a month af­ter the H5N8 dis­ease was first found in wild fowl.</p>
    <p>The risk to hu­mans from the dis­ease is con­sid­ered low, but the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion said it has been spread­ing among mi­gra­tory birds that then trans­mit it to do­mes­tic poul­try.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain on Mon­day or­dered a cull of 13,000 birds at a farm in Frod­sham, Cheshire, af­ter de­tect­ing cases there.</p>
    <p>Over in Ger­many, the Sch­leswigHol­stein State Min­istry yes­ter­day said that bird flu of the type H5N8 has been found on a poul­try farm in the north­ern state.</p>
    <p>Eight chick­ens died within a short time on a farm in the state, the min­istry said, adding that the rest of the poul­try on the farm had been culled and dis­posed of pro­fes­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, a case of H5N8 bird flu was con­firmed in a poul­try farm in the north­ern state of Lower Sax­ony.</p>
    <p>Dutch poul­try farm­ers have been or­dered to keep birds in­side un­til fur­ther no­tice to pre­vent trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The farm at the cen­tre of yes­ter­day’s cull in Pui­flijk is within 3km of the first case, 30km from the Ger­man bor­der near Ni­jmegen. Other farms nearby are be­ing tested for the dis­ease, while trans­porta­tion of birds is banned within a 10km ra­dius.</p>
    <p>Poul­try is a €1.6 bil­lion (S$2.6 bil­lion) in­dus­try in the Nether­lands, which is Europe’s largest ex­porter of chicken meat and eggs, em­ploy­ing 10,000 peo­ple on 2,000 farms.</p>
