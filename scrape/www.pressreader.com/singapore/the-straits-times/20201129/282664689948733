    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A It is more about missed op­por­tu­ni­ties and not lis­ten­ing to oth­ers’ ad­vice or not act­ing on it in time.</p>
    <p>I was not a very en­gaged in­vestor in my 20s and let a num­ber of op­por­tu­ni­ties slip me by.</p>
    <p>I nearly in­vested in bit­coin some time in 2011 or 2012, but was too busy and missed out on what would have been a fan­tas­tic in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>There have been a num­ber of com­pa­nies over the years, too, which I was sure would be suc­cess­ful, but I never in­vested in them. A re­cent ex­am­ple is Be­yond Meat.</p>
    <p>Though I don’t be­lieve in hav­ing much of your port­fo­lio in in­di­vid­u­ally picked stocks as gen­er­ally, it is tough to out­per­form the mar­ket, hav­ing a pot of funds for this can al­low you to go over some stocks you re­ally be­lieve in.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, I just didn’t get around to mak­ing those in­vest­ments I wanted to.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A I in­vested in a prop­erty in Hong Kong’s Kennedy Town with my sis­ter in 2014. We each put in about 25 per cent and took out a mort­gage for the re­main­ing 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>It was sold last year and we made a gain of roughly 50 per cent in the five years.</p>
    <p>When we in­vested in the place, we saw the great po­ten­tial of the his­tor­i­cal, dated neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>With the con­struc­tion of the MTR (mass tran­sit rail­way) there and the ever-up­wards prop­erty prices in Hong Kong, Kennedy Town has un­der­gone some­what of a re­nais­sance and be­come a much more de­sir­able place to live.</p>
