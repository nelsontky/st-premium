    <p>LONDON • It was 2am on a Tues­day when the raid be­gan at the Eye­wit­ness War Mu­seum in the town of Beek, the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>First, a group of thieves teased open the mu­seum’s front gate.</p>
    <p>“You can see it on our cam­eras,” said Mr Wim Seelen, the mu­seum’s di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>But then, they dis­ap­peared. An hour later, the bur­glars re­turned in sev­eral es­tate cars. In a scene rem­i­nis­cent of a heist movie, they spread out tyres across the high­way that runs past the mu­seum to cre­ate a road­block and parked a fake po­lice car be­side it, so it looked of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>Over the next five min­utes, the group – maybe 12 peo­ple in to­tal, Mr Seelen said – bat­tered down the mu­seum’s front door, broke dis­play cab­i­nets and took what they had come for: nine man­nequins wear­ing rare Nazi uni­forms. The out­fits in­cluded one worn by Hitler’s per­sonal chef and an­other by a high-rank­ing mem­ber of the SS.</p>
    <p>The rob­bers took other items of World War II mem­o­ra­bilia, Mr Seelen said, with the haul worth about US$1.5 mil­lion (S$2 mil­lion) i n to­tal.</p>
    <p>“It was done with mil­i­tary pre­ci­sion,” he added.</p>
    <p>The mu­seum’s alarms went off, but the po­lice – held up by the road­block – ar­rived too late to catch any­one.</p>
    <p>“Of course, I’m ter­ri­fied it will hap­pen again,” Mr Seelen said.</p>
    <p>The Aug 4 raid in Beek was only the most dra­matic in a string of re­cent rob­beries from World War II mu­se­ums in Europe and the bur­glar­ies are spread­ing panic among sim­i­lar in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Since March, four mu­se­ums in the Nether­lands and Denmark have been bro­ken into and mem­o­ra­bilia, in­clud­ing Nazi uni­forms, has been stolen.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent raid took place on Nov 3, when rob­bers broke through a win­dow at the Ger­man Mu­seum North Sch­leswig, in south­ern Denmark, and made off with three man­nequins in Nazi out­fits.</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tors from all four of the bur­glarised in­sti­tu­tions said they be­lieved the thieves were act­ing on the or­ders of col­lec­tors look­ing to get their hands on rare Nazi mem­o­ra­bilia.</p>
    <p>But they were un­cer­tain whether the rob­beries were car­ried out by the same group or were sim­ply part of a wor­ry­ing trend.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers of the Dutch and Dan­ish po­lice said in tele­phone in­ter­views that they had no sus­pects in any of the rob­beries, but were look­ing for pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Bron­swijk of the Dutch po­lice’s art crime unit said his team had two the­o­ries: that wealthy col­lec­tors in Rus­sia or East</p>
    <p>It was done with mil­i­tary pre­ci­sion. Of course, I’m ter­ri­fied it will hap­pen again.</p>
    <p>ern Europe had or­dered the rob­beries, or that they were un­der­taken by sup­port­ers of the far right.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond the­ory was less likely, he added, “as those guys don’t have much money and like to buy repli­cas”. The raid at the Eye­wit­ness War Mu­seum was in­cred­i­bly pro­fes­sional, he said.</p>
    <p>“They were re­ally like Ocean’s Twelve,” he added, re­fer­ring to the 2004 Hol­ly­wood heist movie.</p>
    <p>The Nether­lands and Denmark, which were both oc­cu­pied by Nazi Ger­many dur­ing World War II, have nu­mer­ous small, pri­vate and state-funded mu­se­ums de­voted to the his­tory of that con­flict.</p>
    <p>Many have glass dis­play cases filled with mem­o­ra­bilia in­clud­ing weapons, and dio­ra­mas de­pict­ing scenes from the war, with man­nequins in orig­i­nal uni­forms. There are around 100 in the Nether­lands alone, Mr Seelen es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>Many Dutch mu­se­ums have taken rare items off dis­play or im­proved their se­cu­rity sys­tems in re­sponse to the re­cent rob­beries. The Arn­hem War Mu­seum has in­stalled anti-tank bar­ri­ers at its en­trance, “so peo­ple can’t come with a big truck”, said Ms Ma­rina Moens, one of its own­ers.</p>
    <p>Con­cern is grow­ing in Denmark too.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure ev­ery mu­seum’s tak­ing pre­cau­tions,” said Mr Hen­rik Skov Kris­tensen, di­rec­tor of the Froslev Camp Mu­seum. “But if some­one’s de­ter­mined to do some­thing like this, they will.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kris­tensen’s mu­seum, set in a for­mer prison camp in Denmark, was robbed in March. The bur­glars also took SS uni­forms. After find­ing no leads, Dan­ish po­lice closed the in­ves­ti­ga­tion in April, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Giel van Wassen­hove, a Bel­gian dealer in mil­i­tary mem­o­ra­bilia, said the value of Nazi items had been ris­ing for years.</p>
    <p>“The stuff that’s be­ing stolen is all very de­sir­able and the prices are go­ing crazy,” he said. “Ev­ery­one knows if it’s got a Nazi em­blem on it, its price is high.”</p>
    <p>An SS uni­form could fetch any­where from US$3,500 to US$35,000, he said.</p>
    <p>In the two Dutch rob­beries, thieves stole a spe­cial ri­fle, the “FG 42”, which was used by Nazi para­troop­ers, Mr van Wassen­hove said.</p>
    <p>A decade ago, he said, that gun was worth about US$60,000. To­day, it is worth more than US$175,000.</p>
    <p>But he played down sug­ges­tions that a boom in far-right col­lec­tors was driv­ing the soar­ing prices. Most buy­ers were in­vestors sim­ply chas­ing a profit, he said.</p>
