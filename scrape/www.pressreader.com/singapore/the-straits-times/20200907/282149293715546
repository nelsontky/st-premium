    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court pa­pers filed, Ms Va­len­cia Zu­niga Va­le­ria El­iz­a­beth was a fit 39-year-old who led an ac­tive life that in­cluded run­ning marathons.</p>
    <p>Mar­ried with three chil­dren, with the youngest now aged 14, she was an IT spe­cial­ist with a multi­na­tional firm and had worked in Sin­ga­pore for over nine years. She lost her job be­cause of her cur­rent med­i­cal con­di­tion, she said.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments filed by her lawyer Raj Singh Shergill claim that she had a good prog­no­sis in that the tu­mour on her spinal cord could have been sur­gi­cally treated with close sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>But fol­low­ing the al­leged treat­ment by the de­fen­dants, she now ex­pe­ri­ences con­stant pain and her neu­ro­log­i­cal func­tion has been af­fected. The fore­cast for re­cov­ery is also poor.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the symp­toms of ra­di­a­tion dam­age have dis­placed the tu­mour se­verely.</p>
    <p>The ra­di­a­tion treat­ment caused per­ma­nent and ir­re­versible dam­age to the spinal cord. It ac­counts for the ma­jor­ity of Ms Zu­niga’s cur­rent symp­toms, in­clud­ing se­vere spasms, in­creased sen­si­tiv­ity to touch and pain, loss of nor­mal func­tion of her legs, spon­ta­neous spasms in her legs, uri­nary tract in­fec­tions and sleep in­ter­rup­tion due to se­vere and per­ma­nent pain and spasms.</p>
    <p>The ra­di­a­tion dam­age left her phys­i­cally weak and the se­vere and per­ma­nent pain af­fected her abil­ity to work and im­paired her so­cial, oc­cu­pa­tional and recre­ational pur­suits, the court doc­u­ments say.</p>
    <p>Ms Zu­niga, now 47, has also suf­fered bouts of se­vere de­pres­sion and her to­tal med­i­cal ex­penses so far have topped $226,850 and are con­tin­u­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the de­fen­dants, in ad­di­tion to con­test­ing her neg­li­gence suit, al­lege that her claims are also time-barred un­der the Lim­i­ta­tion Act.</p>
