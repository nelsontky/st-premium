    <p>The In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) has called on tel­cos to be more flex­i­ble when cus­tomers want to ter­mi­nate ser­vice con­tracts that have ex­pired.</p>
    <p>Its move comes af­ter read­ers ear­lier wrote in to The Straits Times Forum page com­plain­ing about M1’s “un­fair” busi­ness prac­tices in this re­spect.</p>
    <p>M1 had re­quired cus­tomers to give no­tice of ter­mi­na­tion ex­actly seven days be­fore their broadband ser­vice con­tracts ended, fail­ing which, the con­tract would be au­to­mat­i­cally re­newed.</p>
    <p>The IMDA noted that most tel­cos of­fer their cus­tomers the op­tion to ter­mi­nate their ser­vice plans when the min­i­mum con­tract term ex­pires.</p>
    <p>Most tel­cos also no­tify cus­tomers of the con­tract end-date in ad­vance, and do not spec­ify a date the no­tice must be served by.</p>
    <p>“We have asked tel­cos that do not al­ready do so, such as M1, to of­fer sim­i­lar flex­i­bil­ity to their cus­tomers,” said IMDA com­mu­ni­ca­tions and mar­ket­ing clus­ter direc­tor Foo Wen Dee.</p>
    <p>“IMDA ex­pects tel­cos to safe­guard their cus­tomers’ in­ter­ests, and to take their feed­back se­ri­ously.”</p>
    <p>The IMDA was re­spond­ing to two let­ters pub­lished in ST on Aug 27 and Sept 4, in which the writ­ers ques­tioned the prac­tice of re­quir­ing cus­tomers to give no­tice of ter­mi­na­tion for con­tracts that have run out.</p>
    <p>The first let­ter, from Dr Jeremy Teo, gave de­tails of his ex­pe­ri­ence with M1’s seven-day no­tice of ter­mi­na­tion pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“To make cus­tomers call in on an ar­bi­trar­ily de­fined date or sub­ject them to penal­ties or to con­tinue billing is un­fair and un­eth­i­cal,” Dr Teo wrote.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond let­ter, from Mr Cheng Shoong Tat, ar­gued that such prac­tices fly in the face of the ba­sic prin­ci­ples of con­tract law.</p>
    <p>The Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (Case) also weighed in on the mat­ter yes­ter­day, call­ing M1’s ter­mi­na­tion pol­icy “too oner­ous” and urg­ing the telco to re­view its prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“It is un­fair to re­quire con­sumers to make the re­quest to ter­mi­nate the con­tract only on a spe­cific day, es­pe­cially for long-term con­tracts,” said Case pres­i­dent and Mount­bat­ten MP Lim Biow Chuan.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers should be al­lowed to ter­mi­nate their broadband con­tracts as long as they give a min­i­mum of seven days’ no­tice, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also noted that no­tice pe­ri­ods for ter­mi­na­tion dif­fer among the tel­cos. For in­stance, Sing­tel does not spec­ify a min­i­mum no­tice pe­riod while StarHub re­quires a no­tice pe­riod of at least one month.</p>
    <p>“We ad­vise con­sumers to scru­ti­nise the terms and con­di­tions, and pay spe­cial at­ten­tion to clauses re­lated to ter­mi­na­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Sin­ga­pore pub­lished a set of price trans­parency guide­lines warn­ing against mis­lead­ing ad­ver­tis­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines, which take ef­fect on Nov 1, cover four ar­eas: drip pric­ing, which refers to fees added on to the ad­ver­tised price dur­ing the trans­ac­tion process; false or mis­lead­ing price com­par­isons; fake dis­counts; and use of the term “free”.</p>
    <p>We re­fer to the let­ters by Dr Jeremy Teo Chin Ghee (Telco’s un­fair poli­cies over non-re­newal of ser­vice con­tract, Aug 27; Telco’s busi­ness prac­tice un­fair, es­pe­cially to Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion, Sept 5; and Mr Cheng Shoong Tat (IMDA should ban ab­surd terms in telco con­tracts, Sept 5).</p>
    <p>The In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) takes the pro­tec­tion of telco cus­tomers’ in­ter­ests se­ri­ously. Cur­rently, most tel­cos of­fer their cus­tomers the op­tion to ter­mi­nate their ser­vice plans upon ex­piry of the min­i­mum con­tract term.</p>
    <p>They no­tify cus­tomers of their min­i­mum con­tract term end-date in ad­vance and do not spec­ify a date that a no­tice to ter­mi­nate must be served. We have asked tel­cos that don’t al­ready do so, such as M1, to of­fer sim­i­lar flex­i­bil­ity to their cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Tel­cos of­ten of­fer pro­mo­tional rates, sub­ject to cus­tomers com­mit­ting to a min­i­mum sub­scrip­tion term. When the min­i­mum term ends, ser­vices au­to­mat­i­cally rollover to en­sure there is no dis­rup­tion to ac­cess. Nor­mal ser­vice prices may then ap­ply. Cus­tomers can de­cide to ter­mi­nate their sub­scrip­tion and con­tract any time af­ter the min­i­mum term, with­out any penalty charges.</p>
    <p>IMDA ex­pects tel­cos to safe­guard their cus­tomers’ in­ter­ests, and to take their feed­back se­ri­ously.</p>
