    <p>The sup­plier of seafood to restau­rants such as Labyrinth, Hump­back and Salted & Hung, as well as to the Swis­so­tel and Con­rad ho­tels, saw that side of its busi­ness plunge by 90 per cent be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Some restau­rants that closed down also re­fused to pay for stock de­liv­ered be­fore the cir­cuit breaker. “Our bad debts came up to more than $60,000 – a huge blow for a small com­pany like ours,” says the farm’s part­ner Wong Jing Kai.</p>
    <p>He started the Ah Hua Ke­long brand 61/ years ago</p>
    <p>2 with Mr Teh Aik Hua, who has owned the farm for more than 15 years.</p>
    <p>The com­pany runs a float­ing farm off Pu­lau Ubin and a ke­long off Sem­bawang, each tak­ing up 0.5ha. They rear pearl garoupa, seabass, snap­per, pom­fret and lob­ster, and also sell wild-caught mus­sels, clams and flower crab.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong says: “Covid-19 caught us with our pants down, and we scram­bled to stay rel­e­vant and pivot. We sud­denly saw many com­peti­tors for home de­liv­ery, which made us look at mar­ket­ing our prod­ucts dif­fer­ently.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it or­gan­ised a home cook­ing com­pe­ti­tion where con­sumers came up with recipes us­ing its seafood. The top three en­tries won vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Ah Hua also runs seafood restau­rant Scaled in Laven­der, which of­fered home de­liv­ery for the first time dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>When phase two kicked in, home de­liv­ery sales plum­meted by about 70 per cent, Mr Wong says. This was off­set by a 15 per cent jump in de­mand from restau­rants that re­opened as well as new eater­ies such as Laut and Av­enue 87 that are ded­i­cated to us­ing lo­cal pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong is tap­ping tech­nol­ogy to in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity, by in­stalling so­lar pan­els on the farm’s roof and us­ing a wa­ter jet ma­chine to re­move bar­na­cles in­stead of do­ing it man­u­ally.</p>
    <p>His con­stant chal­lenge, he says, is ed­u­cat­ing cus­tomers on why lo­cal pro­duce is priced slightly higher than those from neigh­bour­ing coun­tries (higher costs is the rea­son) and why they should sup­port lo­cal pro­duc­ers.</p>
    <p>He says of the “30 by 30” tar­get: “While it is im­por­tant Sin­ga­pore does it for food se­cu­rity, pro­duc­tion is not the only is­sue. We need to look into de­mand as well.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to reach out to house­holds and chefs and also use Scaled to high­light why lo­cal pro­duce tastes just as good as, if not bet­ter than, im­ports.”</p>
