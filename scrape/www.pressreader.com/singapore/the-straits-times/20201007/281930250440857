    <p>Aus­tralia yes­ter­day un­veiled plans to take on record debt to fund tax cuts and business sup­port as it charted a path to re­cov­ery from the dev­as­tat­ing eco­nomic ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing its first an­nual bud­get since the Covid-19 out­break, the rul­ing Lib­eral-Na­tional coali­tion tried to re­store eco­nomic con­fi­dence de­spite its plans to take on spi­ralling lev­els of debt.</p>
    <p>The bud­get deficit is set to be A$214 bil­lion (S$208 bil­lion) this year and the na­tional debt ex­pected to peak at A$966 bil­lion in 2024.</p>
    <p>In his bud­get speech in Par­lia­ment, Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg said: “There re­mains a mon­u­men­tal task ahead... Aus­tralia is up to the task… The Great De­pres­sion and two world wars did not bring Aus­tralia to its knees, nei­ther will Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s bud­get fore­casts in­cluded some re­veal­ing as­sump­tions about the fu­ture course of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is as­sum­ing that an ef­fec­tive vac­cine will be avail­able by late next year.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent travel curbs are ex­pected to cause an over­all out­flow of peo­ple this year for the first time since 1946, with de­par­tures ex­pected to ex­ceed ar­rivals by 72,000.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is ex­pected to shrink by 3.75 per cent in 2020/21 be­fore in­creas­ing – al­beit off a low base – by 4.25 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment is ex­pected to rise to 8 per cent later this year, be­fore fall­ing to 6 per cent by 2023.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia had en­joyed 28 years of con­sec­u­tive growth be­fore the pan­demic plunged the na­tion into a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>But the econ­omy has be­gun to re­cover, aided by China’s con­tin­ued de­mand for the na­tion’s iron ore and by Aus­tralia’s suc­cess in com­bat­ing the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia, which has about 25 mil­lion res­i­dents, had recorded 27,174 Covid-19 cases and 895 deaths. There were 28 new cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 15 in the state of Vic­to­ria, which con­tin­ues to im­pose harsh re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The bud­get fo­cused on big-spend­ing mea­sures aimed at pro­mot­ing business and con­sumer con­fi­dence. More than 11 mil­lion Aus­tralians will re­ceive tax cuts of up to A$49 a week, which will be back­dated to July 1.</p>
    <p>An A$4 bil­lion scheme will try to boost hir­ing of young work­ers by al­low­ing em­ploy­ers to claim tax de­duc­tions of up to A$200 a week for each per­son they hire who is aged 16 to 35.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses have also re­ceived tax in­cen­tives to make new in­vest­ments which could help 3.5 mil­lion firms.</p>
    <p>Business groups have largely wel­comed the bud­get, say­ing its tar­geted spend­ing would help to boost in­vest­ment and as­sist em­ploy­ers to cre­ate jobs.</p>
    <p>Ms Jen­nifer Westacott, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Business Coun­cil of Aus­tralia, said: “The bud­get goes a long way to restor­ing hope and giv­ing us con­fi­dence that we can come back stronger and bet­ter than be­fore as we com­bat an un­prece­dented global down­turn.”</p>
    <p>But wel­fare groups crit­i­cised the fail­ure to com­pen­sate for the planned re­moval later this year of ad­di­tional ben­e­fits that have been given to wel­fare re­cip­i­ents to help them cope with the ef­fects of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Eco­nom­ics com­men­ta­tor Ross Git­tins praised the de­ci­sion to boost spend­ing, but he crit­i­cised the fo­cus on cut­ting taxes, say­ing this would do lit­tle to as­sist jobs or re­tail spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“This tax cut is much more about po­lit­i­cal pop­u­lar­ity than get­ting the econ­omy out of re­ces­sion,” he wrote in The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald.</p>
