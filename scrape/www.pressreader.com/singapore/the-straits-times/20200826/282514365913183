    <p>The new OnePlus Nord is a solid mid-range smart­phone that costs just $649 – af­ford­able for a 5Gca­pable model.</p>
    <p>It comes at a time when smart­phone mak­ers have bumped up their pric­ing, es­pe­cially for 5G mod­els.</p>
    <p>OnePlus, too, has in­creased its prices this year. The OnePlus 8 Pro, which de­buted in April, was the Chi­nese smart­phone brand’s most ex­pen­sive model yet, at $1,298.</p>
    <p>Thus, the rel­a­tively af­ford­able Nord feels like OnePlus re­turn­ing to the value-for-money ap­proach that has de­fined the brand.</p>
    <p>My first im­pres­sion of the Nord is that it feels like a pre­mium smart­phone, thanks to a curved, dan­ger­ously smooth glass back and a near­bezel-less fa­cade.</p>
    <p>The edges of the phone have a glossy me­tal­lic fin­ish. How­ever, this frame is, like many cheaper phones, made of plas­tic and not me­tal.</p>
    <p>There is also no head­phone jack, while the speaker is a sin­gle down­ward-fir­ing one that can be muf­fled by a cupped palm when hold­ing the phone in the landscape ori­en­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing just 128GB of in­ter­nal stor­age on the base model, the Nord lacks a mi­croSD card slot for ex­pand­able stor­age.</p>
    <p>But at least it re­tains OnePlus’ dis­tinc­tive alert slider – a phys­i­cal tog­gle that lets you switch between silent, vi­brate and ring modes.</p>
    <p>I have no com­plaints about the Nord’s in-dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor, which feels like one of the bet­ter ones in the mar­ket in terms of ac­cu­racy and speed.</p>
    <p>But it took me a while to get used to the Nord’s hole-punch cam­era cut­off, mainly be­cause it is wider than usual in or­der to fit a sec­ond, ul­tra-wide cam­era for group self­ies.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing one more selfie cam­era than most smart­phones, the selfie pho­tos taken by the Nord did not im­press. The ul­tra-wide cam­era is us­able in a pinch, but pho­tos had too much noise for my lik­ing.</p>
    <p>The im­age pro­cess­ing for the main selfie cam­era is also not as good as that of top-tier mod­els. Pho­tos with a bright light source in the background of­ten turned out to be over­ex­posed.</p>
    <p>As for the rear quad cam­era unit, the main 48-megapixel (MP) cam­era ap­pears to be of a sim­i­lar grade as the one on the OnePlus 8.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the usual pixel-bin­ning tech­nique, it shoots 12MP pho­tos that look sharp with good colour ac­cu­racy.</p>
    <p>Its low-light mode, dubbed Nightscape, pro­duces de­cent enough pho­tos at night, al­beit not as good as flag­ship smart­phone cam­eras. The re­sult­ing low-light pho­tos also ex­hibit a yel­low­ish cast.</p>
    <p>The sec­ondary cam­eras are fairly medi­ocre. The ul­tra-wide cam­era is pass­able, but pho­tos by the macro cam­era look soft and un­fo­cused.</p>
    <p>In short, the ex­tra cam­eras of­ten feel as though they are sim­ply there to make up the num­bers for OnePlus to say the Nord has a quad cam­era sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Un­like its cam­eras, the Nord’s Amoled screen is ac­tu­ally quite good. It is bright, colour­ful and sup­ports a 90Hz re­fresh rate for a smoother feel when nav­i­gat­ing the phone in­ter­face. You can still se­lect the stan­dard, less power-hun­gry 60Hz re­fresh rate to con­serve bat­tery life.</p>
    <p>It also sup­ports High Dy­namic Range (HDR10) videos in the Net­flix app, though the HDR ef­fect on phones re­mains far in­fe­rior to the ex­pe­ri­ence on a HDR tele­vi­sion set.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the use of the midrange Qual­comm Snap­dragon 765G pro­ces­sor, the Nord is one of the most af­ford­able 5G-ca­pa­ble smart­phone i n the mar­ket. Most 5G phones use the flag­ship – and more ex­pen­sive – Snap­dragon 865 chip.</p>
    <p>On pa­per, the Nord should work with sub-6GHz 5G net­works, such as the one launched by StarHub last week. How­ever, a soft­ware update may be re­quired for the Nord be­fore it can tap StarHub’s 5G net­work.</p>
    <p>The Snap­dragon 765G of­fers more than suf­fi­cient com­put­ing power for most tasks. It may be a tad slower at open­ing apps but I en­coun­tered no lag while us­ing the Nord.</p>
    <p>It prob­a­bly helps that OnePlus’ Oxy­gen OS in­ter­face is rel­a­tively lean. It is ba­si­cally stock An­droid 10 with a few OnePlus ex­tras such as Par­al­lel Apps, which lets you run two in­stances of mes­sag­ing apps, such as Tele­gram, on the same de­vice.</p>
    <p>With the Nord’s dis­play set to run at 90Hz, it usu­ally has about 30 per cent of its bat­tery life left at the end of a typ­i­cal work day for me.</p>
    <p>In The Straits Times’ video-loop bat­tery test (at max­i­mum screen bright­ness), the Nord clocked 14 hours and 22 min­utes com­pared with 16 hours and 5 min­utes for the Vivo X50 Pro, which also uses the Snap­dragon 765G chip.</p>
    <p>If you are not picky about the qual­ity of smart­phone pho­tos, the OnePlus Nord of­fers a fluid, near-stock An­droid ex­pe­ri­ence with nice ex­tras, such as 5G con­nec­tiv­ity and a 90Hz screen, at an af­ford­able price.</p>
