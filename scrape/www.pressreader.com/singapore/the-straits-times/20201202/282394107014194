    <p>Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has backed Edin­son Ca­vani fol­low­ing the striker’s In­sta­gram post, which ap­peared to use a racist term.</p>
    <p>Af­ter United’s 3-2 come­back Premier League win over Southamp­ton on Sun­day, when the Uruguayan scored a brace and pro­vided an as­sist, he used the Span­ish term “negrito” (small black per­son) on In­sta­gram in thank­ing a friend for his con­grat­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>De­spite the af­fec­tion­ate con­text, he could still fall foul of the</p>
    <p>Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s (FA) min­i­mum three-match do­mes­tic ban for of­fen­sive com­ments on so­cial me­dia. But the 33-year-old, who has since deleted the post, will be free to play against his for­mer club Paris Saint-Ger­main in the Cham­pi­ons League to­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at his pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Sol­sk­jaer said: “(Edin­son) is really sorry for the mis­take he’s made. No ma­li­cious in­tent at all, just an af­fec­tion­ate greet­ing. We sup­port him.</p>
    <p>“It’s one of those un­for­tu­nate sit­u­a­tions where he’s just come into the coun­try and in Uruguay it’s been used in a dif­fer­ent way.</p>
    <p>“He is ready to play and of course it’s spe­cial for him to play against PSG. He is so pro­fes­sional, and he will work on his mind­set to­day to get ready for the game.”</p>
    <p>“Negrito” was the same word Ca­vani’s in­ter­na­tional team­mate Luis Suarez used to­wards Pa­trice Evra, a French black player, dur­ing a game be­tween Liver­pool and United in 2011. Suarez ar­gued that the word was a term of en­dear­ment and not in­tended as a form of racial abuse. How­ever, the FA re­jected this ex­pla­na­tion given the “con­text of heated ex­changes be­tween the play­ers” and Suarez was banned for eight matches.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer has also urged his play­ers to get the job done in the Cham­pi­ons League as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“We go out there in our style with at­tack­ing in­tent and de­fend­ing well against a top team,” said the Nor­we­gian, whose side are top of Group H with nine points and need only to avoid de­feat to progress to the last 16.</p>
    <p>“Our mind­set is to win the game and win the group.”</p>
    <p>David de Gea (knee), Paul Pogba (an­kle) and An­thony Mar­tial (ill­ness) are doubts for to­day’s clash but the United boss re­mained coy about in­jury up­dates.</p>
    <p>PSG, who are three points behind, have con­firmed they are with­out Pablo Sara­bia, Mauro Icardi, Ju­lian Draxler, Juan Ber­nat, Kays Ruiz and Jese due to in­jury.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Sevilla host Chelsea with both sides tied at the top of Group E with 10 points apiece and al­ready through to the next round.</p>
