    <p>Pop­u­lar lo­cal tele­vi­sion se­ri­als from the 1990s, such as Un­der One Roof and Phua Chu Kang, have re­turned to TV screens.</p>
    <p>Un­der One Roof, which ran from 1995 to 2003, was the first lo­cally pro­duced English-lan­guage sit­com in Sin­ga­pore while Phua Chu Kang, which ran for a decade from 1997, fea­tured a con­trac­tor i n yel­low boots and permed hair. The char­ac­ter re­cently ap­peared i n Covid-19 ad­vi­sories.</p>
    <p>More than 100 Sin­ga­pore films and tele­vi­sion se­ries, in­clud­ing the two sit­coms, will be avail­able on the Net­flix cat­a­logue as the video-stream­ing firm looks to en­gage and ex­pand its reach among lo­cal au­di­ences amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The stream­ing ser­vice, which be­gan ahead of Na­tional Day last month, is the re­sult of part­ner­ships be­tween Net­flix and lo­cal stu­dios, such as pro­duc­tion houses Clover Films and mm2 En­ter­tain­ment and na­tional broad­caster Mediacorp.</p>
    <p>“By mak­ing th­ese ti­tles eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble through Net­flix, we hope it will reignite the j oy they’ve brought to many Sin­ga­pore­ans over the decades, but more im­por­tantly, in­tro­duce th­ese great works of art by some of the best lo­cal film-mak­ers to the younger gen­er­a­tions,” said Mr Raphael Pang, Net­flix’s con­tent ac­qui­si­tion man­ager for South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Other shows in the line-up for the stream­ing ser­vice gi­ant in­clude the ac­claimed fam­ily drama Ilo Ilo by di­rec­tor An­thony Chen. The film won the Cam­era d’Or prize for Best De­but Fea­ture at the 2013 Cannes Film Fes­ti­val, a first by a Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>Also in the cat­a­logue are films by an­other of Sin­ga­pore’s most suc­cess­ful di­rec­tors, Jack Neo, in­clud­ing 2003’s Homerun, a Man­darin-lan­guage film about two poor sib­lings, and 2002’s I Not Stupid, which fol­lowed the lives of three Pri­mary 6 pupils in an in­fe­rior aca­demic stream.</p>
    <p>The hit films about a group of army re­cruits, Ah Boys To Men from 2012, and Ah Boys To Men 2 from 2013, are also be­ing streamed.</p>
    <p>Other works to look out for in­clude Kelvin Tong’s 2011 pe­riod film It’s A Great, Great World, Michelle Chong’s com­edy Al­ready Fa­mous from 2011, and Eric Khoo’s ac­claimed drama Mee Pok Man from 1995.</p>
    <p>Also avail­able are the three sea­sons of The Un­beat­a­bles.</p>
    <p>The drama se­rial on gam­bling, which first aired in 1993, launched the ca­reers of then new faces Zoe Tay and Li Nanx­ing and cat­a­pulted them to star­dom, as well as mak­ing them the coun­try’s most pro­lific on­screen stars.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s long­est-run­ning home-grown English-lan­guage drama, Growing Up, will also be shown on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion se­ries ran for six sea­sons from 1996 to 2002 and had 128 episodes.</p>
