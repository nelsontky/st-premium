    <p>Her­bert Kret­zmer, a London theatre critic who wrote the English lyrics to an all-but-for­got­ten French mu­si­cal called Les Mis­er­ables in 1985, giv­ing new life to what has be­come one of the world’s most suc­cess­ful theatre pro­duc­tions, died on Wed­nes­day at his home in London. He was 95.</p>
    <p>A South African jour­nal­ist who sold his ac­cor­dion to buy his pas­sage to Europe, Kret­zmer wrote fea­tures and col­umns for London news­pa­pers be­fore he be­gan de­vel­op­ing a sec­ond ca­reer as a lyricist and song­writer.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish pro­ducer Cameron Mack­in­tosh took no­tice and asked Kret­zmer to reimag­ine an ob­scure mu­si­cal that had opened and closed after a few months in Paris in 1980, five years ear­lier.</p>
    <p>France had no tra­di­tion of mu­si­cal theatre and Les Mis­er­ables was based on French nov­el­ist Vic­tor Hugo’s epic 19th-cen­tury tale of op­pres­sion, lib­er­a­tion and re­demp­tion. And it was all sung in French.</p>
    <p>Kret­zmer’s task was not to lit­er­ally trans­late the orig­i­nal li­bretto, by Alain Bou­blil and Jean-Marc Na­tel. What he tried to do in­stead was to cap­ture, in English, the spirit of Hugo’s tale of rev­o­lu­tion – the songs of an­gry men and women yearn­ing for free­dom.</p>
    <p>“The show I in­her­ited from Paris ran for just two hours,” Kret­zmer told The New Yorker in 2013. “The show I wrote in English ran for just over three hours. You don’t need to be a math whiz to cal­cu­late that at least a third of the play did not ex­ist be­fore I got my hands on it.”</p>
    <p>With the Kret­zmer li­bretto, ad­di­tional lyrics by James Fen­ton and mu­sic by Claude-Michel Schon­berg, Les Mis­er­ables opened in London on Oct 8, 1985.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ences were moved nightly to sob and scream. Fan mail poured in. The box of­fice was swamped.</p>
    <p>The London pro­duc­tion ran con­tin­u­ously from 1985 un­til this March, when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut­tered London’s theatres, mak­ing it the West End’s long­est-run­ning mu­si­cal.</p>
    <p>Kret­zmer is sur­vived by his sec­ond wife Sy­bil Sever, his two chil­dren with his first wife Elisabeth Wil­son and two grand­sons.</p>
