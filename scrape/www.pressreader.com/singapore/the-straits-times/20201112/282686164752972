    <p>A com­pe­ti­tion by a French start-up gives mu­si­cians in Asia the chance to win a trip to Paris and per­form with a pro­fes­sional or­ches­tra.</p>
    <p>The No­madPlay Com­pe­ti­tion – part of the Voilah! France Sin­ga­pore Fes­ti­val, and first mooted by Sin­ga­porean con­duc­tor Wong Kah Chun (above) – comes with a dig­i­tal twist.</p>
    <p>First, con­tes­tants must sign in to No­madPlay, an app that gives them ac­cess to record­ings of pro­fes­sional en­sem­bles. The re­mote musician can iso­late the sound of any in­stru­ment, and play to­gether with the en­sem­ble as though he or she was part of it.</p>
    <p>Then, he or she needs to film him­self or her­self while play­ing one of the pieces with No­madPlay.</p>
    <p>Advanced mu­si­cians should take part in the com­pe­ti­tion’s Rev­e­la­tion cat­e­gory and record them­selves play­ing with Ce­sar Franck’s Sym­phony In D, first move­ment (recorded with con­duc­tor Wong and the Orchestre na­tional d’Ilede-France). Pi­anists should opt for Mau­rice Ravel’s Vi­o­lin Sonata No. 2, sec­ond move­ment (recorded with French vi­o­lin­ist Raphaelle Moreau and pi­anist Celia Oneto Ben­said).</p>
    <p>The other cat­e­gory, Young Ta­lent, is open to mu­si­cians aged be­low 18 years old. They can choose any piece from the 1,500 ti­tles in No­madPlay’s cat­a­logue.</p>
    <p>The con­test is or­gan­ised by French start-up Dig­i­tal Mu­sic So­lu­tions, which de­vel­oped the No­madPlay app. It is open to peo­ple from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, In­done­sia, Viet­nam, Tai­wan and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Win­ners will be selected by Wong and rep­re­sen­ta­tives from No­madPlay, the Em­bassy of France in Sin­ga­pore, in­stru­ment re­tailer Swee Lee and the Orchestre na­tional d’Ile-de-France.</p>
    <p>The first-prize winner in the Rev­e­la­tion cat­e­gory will get to go on a four-day trip to Paris to per­form with the Orchestre na­tional d’Ile-de-France. There are other prizes to be bagged, such as vouch­ers from Swee Lee.</p>
    <p>The win­ners will be an­nounced on Nov 22 at the clos­ing event of the Voilah! fes­ti­val, dur­ing which a video of the live per­for­mance of Wong and the Orchestre na­tional d’Ile-de-France will also be played.</p>
    <p>Wong, 34, is the chief con­duc­tor of Ger­many’s Nurem­berg Sym­phony Or­ches­tra. He had been in­vited to take part in the fes­ti­val and wanted to of­fer some­thing that would “re­ally cre­ate an im­pact”.</p>
    <p>“This makes me feel that my con­tri­bu­tion to the fes­ti­val, to Sin­ga­pore, adds an ad­di­tional el­e­ment. It’s not sim­ply me per­form­ing with an or­ches­tra.”</p>
    <p>The No­madPlay Com­pe­ti­tion closes on Sun­day. Go to com­pe­ti­tion-voilah2020. no­madplay.app for de­tails.</p>
