    <p>The abil­ity of lo­cal com­pa­nies to make timely pay­ments has plunged to its low­est point in eight years.</p>
    <p>Prompt pay­ments ac­counted for just 38.39 per cent of to­tal trans­ac­tions in the third quar­ter – down from 40.09 per cent in the pre­vi­ous three months.</p>
    <p>This is the low­est level since the sec­ond quar­ter of 2012, when on­time pay­ments made up only 37.3 per cent of to­tal trans­ac­tions, noted the Sin­ga­pore Com­mer­cial Credit Bureau (SCCB) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Prompt pay­ments on a year-onyear ba­sis dropped more sharply – down 10.42 per­cent­age points from the 48.81 per cent recorded in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>D&B Sin­ga­pore com­piled the data from more than 1.6 mil­lion pay­ment trans­ac­tions of firms op­er­at­ing through the SCCB.</p>
    <p>Slow pay­ments dipped from 45.78 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter to 44.16 per cent in the third quar­ter, but were up 6.87 per­cent­age points from 37.29 per cent in the third quar­ter last year.</p>
    <p>A prompt pay­ment is when 90 per cent or more of to­tal bills are paid within the agreed pe­riod. Slow pay­ments oc­cur when less than 50 per cent of to­tal bills are set­tled on time.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, par­tial pay­ments – when 50 to 70 per cent of to­tal bills are paid on time – in­creased mod­er­ately to 17.45 per cent in the third quar­ter, from 14.13 per cent in the pre­vi­ous three months.</p>
    <p>Around 75 per cent of industries saw an in­crease in de­layed pay­ments.</p>
    <p>De­lays within the con­struc­tion sec­tor jumped sig­nif­i­cantly, ac­count­ing for more than half of all to­tal late pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Slow pay­ments in the sec­tor rose from 51.97 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter to 56 per cent in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion has suf­fered more amid the Covid-19 pan­demic be­cause of project de­lays and an over­all drop in de­mand for new build­ings.</p>
    <p>The Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity last month re­vised its pro­jected con­struc­tion de­mand to be­tween $18 bil­lion and $23 bil­lion for the year, down from its Jan­uary forecast of $28 bil­lion to $33 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Pay­ment de­lays in man­u­fac­tur­ing also rose, from 38.52 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter to 39.55 per cent in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, the re­tail sec­tor saw a marked im­prove­ment in pay­ment de­lays com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter af­ter the phase two re­open­ing of busi­nesses on June 19.</p>
    <p>Slow pay­ments fell by 8.92 per­cent­age points to 42.3 per cent in the July to Septem­ber quar­ter, from 51.22 per cent in the pre­vi­ous three months.</p>
    <p>This was largely due to re­tail­ers of gen­eral mer­chan­dise, food and bev­er­age as well ap­parel and ac­ces­sories set­tling their ac­counts.</p>
    <p>D&B Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Au­drey Chia said: “Over­all, the full im­pact of pay­ment de­lays was more greatly felt in the third quar­ter com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter as busi­nesses con­tinue to face cash flow woes.”</p>
    <p>She said the con­struc­tion sec­tor in par­tic­u­lar has seen a sig­nif­i­cant de­te­ri­o­ra­tion due to a se­ries of de­lays in project com­ple­tion.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, we have also seen an in­crease in par­tial pay­ments be­ing made by busi­nesses over the pre­vi­ous quar­ter,” she noted. “We would ex­pect this trend of stag­gered pay­ment plans to con­tinue in the com­ing months.”</p>
