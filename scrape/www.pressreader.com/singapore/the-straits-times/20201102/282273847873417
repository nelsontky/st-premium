    <p>The Antarc­tic tun­dra, like the trop­i­cal rain­for­est of South-east Asia, is never silent. Yet, the sound­scapes could not be more dis­sim­i­lar. In the for­est, in­sects buzz, rep­tiles hiss and birds chirp, but as we neared the South Pole, it was the land­scape that re­sounded.</p>
    <p>Waves crashed against the boat. Winds howled through gaps in ice and rock, and sea ice crack­led like hot oil in a wok. But as this trop­i­cal girl dis­cov­ered dur­ing a 10-day ex­pe­di­tion cruise last Novem­ber to the tip of the Antarc­tic Penin­sula, the icy con­ti­nent and the ocean sur­round­ing it are far from bar­ren.</p>
    <p>The wildlife sight­ings started al­most as soon as the Ocean At­lantic, op­er­ated by Al­ba­tros Ex­pe­di­tions, left the port in Ushuaia, the south­ern­most point of Ar­gentina.</p>
    <p>Al­ba­trosses and pe­trels kept pace with the ship across the 800km Drake Pas­sage sep­a­rat­ing South Amer­ica and the Antarc­tic Penin­sula, giv­ing the roughly 200 Sin­ga­pore­ans on Dy­nasty Travel’s in­au­gu­ral Antarc­tica Ex­pe­di­tion</p>
    <p>Cruise an ac­ro­batic dis­play.</p>
    <p>Or­cas and hump­back whales ap­peared closer to our des­ti­na­tion, with seabirds like skuas, snowy sheath­bills and the most iconic of Antarc­tic an­i­mals – pen­guins.</p>
    <p>The pen­guins were the most comedic. Their clumsy gait on land was a far cry from the grace­ful swoop of the al­ba­tross, and even though they were more grace­ful in the wa­ter, they still in­spired more “awws” than “whoas” from us.</p>
    <p>Yet, in a warm­ing world, th­ese pot-bel­lied birds are turn­ing out to be im­por­tant in­di­ca­tors of the health of the Antarc­tic ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>A pre­lim­i­nary study by or­nithol­o­gists on Ele­phant Is­land off Antarc­tica showed that chin­strap pen­guin num­bers may have fallen by more than half, with warm­ing tem­per­a­tures a likely cause, said Na­tional Geo­graphic in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, re­searchers found fewer than half of the 123,000 nests iden­ti­fied by sci­en­tists in 1971, when the last cen­sus of the chin­strap pen­guins took place.</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ard Baker, a po­lar his­to­rian who has worked for more than two decades in the Antarc­tic re­gion, has ob­served first-hand the changes in pen­guin com­po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing the ex­pan­sion in</p>
    <p>range of pen­guins that are bet­ter adapted to a warmer cli­mate, such as the gen­too pen­guins,” said Mr Baker, who was on board the Ocean At­lantic for the ex­pe­di­tion cruise.</p>
    <p>“They are tak­ing over some places in the Antarc­tic Penin­sula that were once the home of the Adelie pen­guin, which is mov­ing far­ther south be­cause it is adapted to colder places.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Antarc­tic Divi­sion’s web­site says four of the 18 pen­guin species live in Antarc­tica.</p>
    <p>Mr Ivan Choo, Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore’s as­sis­tant cu­ra­tor of birds, said that as seas warm, krill pop­u­la­tions could de­cline, re­sult­ing in a de­cline of fish that pen­guins feed on.</p>
    <p>Krill, which are tiny crus­taceans, form the ba­sis of many food chains in the oceans around Antarc­tica.</p>
    <p>Mr Choo added: “The loss of sea ice from warm­ing tem­per­a­tures also re­sults in fewer nest­ing sites for species such as the em­peror pen­guin that breed and raise their young al­most ex­clu­sively on sea ice. Over­fish­ing also di­rectly leads to a de­crease in their food sup­ply.”</p>
    <p>Mr Baker said that while fish­ing and tourism can be reg­u­lated to re­duce their im­pact on Antarc­tica, the chang­ing cli­mate could pose a threat to the icy con­ti­nent.</p>
