    <p>Seven years ago, the­atre-maker Nathalie Ribette was singing for a group of pa­tients at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal. She no­ticed an el­derly woman who stayed through­out her en­tire 20-minute set.</p>
    <p>Ms Ribette, the found­ing artis­tic and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of lo­cal the­atre com­pany Sing’the­atre, was puz­zled. Most pa­tients typ­i­cally did not stay very long as they had med­i­cal ap­point­ments to go to.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the set, the old woman ap­proached Ms Ribette and told her that the per­for­mance of French songs like La Vie En Rose brought back mem­o­ries of her hon­ey­moon in France with her late hus­band.</p>
    <p>“She cried as she hugged me,” re­called Ms Ribette, now 57.</p>
    <p>“I cried too. Though we had noth­ing in com­mon, mu­sic united us.”</p>
    <p>That was Sing’the­atre’s first event at the hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>To­day, the com­pany of eight peo­ple con­tin­ues to bring mu­sic to the sick through com­mu­nity out­reach per­for­mances at pub­lic hospi­tals and else­where.</p>
    <p>One such ini­tia­tive is 365 Days of Mu­sic @SingHealth, a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Sing’the­atre and SingHealth, Sin­ga­pore’s largest group of health­care in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>It aims to pro­vide one hour of live mu­sic at one of SingHealth’s in­sti­tu­tions ev­ery day for a year.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive be­gan on Oct 7 last year and was meant to last a year, but the pan­demic put a halt to it in late Jan­uary this year, as Sing’the­atre could no longer stage live per­for­mances in hospi­tals.</p>
    <p>The com­pany it­self was strug­gling, as the­atres went dark dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With zero per­for­mances, it could not re­ceive any do­na­tions from the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth’s Cul­tural Match­ing Fund, a dol­lar-for-dol­lar match­ing grant for pri­vate cash do­na­tions to reg­is­tered arts char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Ribette: “The do­na­tions from the fund used to cover our busi­ness costs and it was a real prob­lem for us dur­ing that pe­riod to do with­out it.”</p>
    <p>De­spite this, Sing’the­atre adapted. Since May, the com­pany’s mu­si­cians have been per­form­ing live con­certs on­line.</p>
    <p>They have since per­formed vir­tu­ally for pa­tients in hospi­tals, in­clud­ing weekly on­line shows at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal for an av­er­age of 15 to 20 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>In July, they also brought dig­i­tal live per­for­mances in Hindi and Tamil to mi­grant work­ers quar­an­tined at the Sin­ga­pore Expo.</p>
    <p>Piv­ot­ing to dig­i­tal con­certs was not easy as they had to learn the tech­ni­cal­i­ties of live-stream­ing.</p>
    <p>But for Ms Ribette, it has been worth it.</p>
    <p>“At Sing’the­atre, we know that mu­sic brings so much joy and is im­por­tant not just to the sick, but to their fam­i­lies too,” she said.</p>
    <p>“For a while, they are able to for­get about the dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances they are in.”</p>
    <p>UNITED IN MU­SIC</p>
    <p>She cried as she hugged me. I cried too. Though we had noth­ing in com­mon, mu­sic united us.</p>
