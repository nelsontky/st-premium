    <p>Fi­nance ex­ec­u­tive Ryan Koh, 29, spent nearly three hours in a train af­ter a power trip dis­rupted ser­vice along stretches of three MRT lines yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was head­ing home from Cle­menti to Yew Tee when the power fault oc­curred.</p>
    <p>The train he was on came to a halt in­side the tun­nel be­tween Bukit Ba­tok and Bukit Gom­bak sta­tions.</p>
    <p>“Some lights went out im­me­di­ately and the train came to a stop slowly. I was ex­pect­ing a mi­nor de­lay, but I have been stuck for al­most three hours,” he said.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times spoke to him around 9pm, he said the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple in the train had left af­ter SMRT staff started evac­u­at­ing com­muters around 8pm.</p>
    <p>Most re­mained calm and i nformed fam­ily mem­bers about the de­lay, Mr Koh said.</p>
    <p>Senior cit­i­zens were asked to move to the back of the train to dis­em­bark, he added, es­ti­mat­ing that about 70 peo­ple were still on the train when SMRT staff stopped evac­u­at­ing pas­sen­gers around 9pm due to heavy rain and light­ning risk.</p>
    <p>He did not man­age to leave as “the queue was long and slow”.</p>
    <p>At about 9.40pm, the staff told com­muters to be seated and con­firmed that the train would be mov­ing to Bukit Ba­tok.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh, who re­ceived a voucher for one free train ride, said he was tired and hun­gry af­ter dis­em­bark­ing. “I just want to go home as soon as pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>The power fault had dis­rupted ser­vices be­tween Wood­lands and Jurong East on the North-South Line, be­tween Gul Cir­cle and Queen­stown on the East-West Line, and be­tween Har­bour Front and Seran­goon on the Cir­cle Line.</p>
    <p>Some com­muters posted pho­tos on so­cial me­dia of blacked-out sta­tions, in­clud­ing at Yew Tee, Boon Lay and Joo Koon.</p>
    <p>Mr Les­lie Lim, 23, was with­draw­ing money at an ATM at Boon Lay sta­tion when the power fault oc­curred. The na­tional ser­vice­man then learnt that com­muters were not al­lowed to en­ter the sta­tion.</p>
    <p>He checked SMRT’s Twit­ter ac­count, which told com­muters to ex­pect ad­di­tional trav­el­ling time.</p>
    <p>This puz­zled him, he said, as sta­tion staff had in­formed com­muters that train ser­vice was not avail­able.</p>
    <p>He then took a pri­vate-hire ride home to Sengkang – a jour­ney that he said cost him $36 in­stead of the usual $24, due to surge pric­ing.</p>
    <p>There were around 30 to 40 peo­ple who were con­fused, he added.</p>
    <p>He said that safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were not en­forced amid the chaos. “Some of the staff were busy an­swer­ing ques­tions such as what buses to take, some­times sur­rounded by two to three peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>Shops on the ground floor of Jurong East MRT sta­tion were also af­fected by the power out­age.</p>
    <p>While the lights out­side the shops had come back on, staff at the dark­ened Mr Bean out­let were us­ing the torch­lights from their mo­bile phones to serve cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>At 9.30pm, one of its staff mem­bers, who wanted to be known only as Madam Chang, 47, told ST that the elec­tric­ity went off sud­denly at about 7pm and had not been re­stored since.</p>
    <p>“We might have to throw all the drinks in­side the fridge. The pan­cakes are all cold al­ready,” she said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s break­down was among the worst power-re­lated faults in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>In July 2017, a power fault caused train ser­vices on the North-South and East-West lines to fail late at night.</p>
    <p>In April 2016, a power fault trig­gered an un­prece­dented break­down of train ser­vices on three MRT lines and one LRT line.</p>
