    <p>A 48-year-old man, who raped his bi­o­log­i­cal daugh­ter when she was around seven to eight years old and con­tin­ued sex­u­ally abus­ing her for about seven years, was sen­tenced to 28 years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In pass­ing sen­tence, High Court judge Dedar Singh Gill said the man had abused his po­si­tion of author­ity over the young and vul­ner­a­ble vic­tim for his own per­verse sex­ual grat­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the long pe­riod of abuse, the judge said: “This was an age where the vic­tim should be en­joy­ing a bliss­ful and care­free life.”</p>
    <p>The man pleaded guilty to three charges of ag­gra­vated statu­tory rape com­mit­ted against the vic­tim, who was his el­der daugh­ter. An­other four charges – three for ag­gra­vated sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion and one for show­ing a pornograph­ic video to a mi­nor – were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The man can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the iden­tity of the vic­tim, who is now 16 years old.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the self-em­ployed man be­gan sex­u­ally ex­ploit­ing the vic­tim when she was seven to eight years old, and did so un­til she was 14.</p>
    <p>He abused the girl when her mother was not at home. Some­times, he per­formed lewd acts in the girl’s pres­ence and also showed her pornograph­ic videos on his phone.</p>
    <p>He first raped her be­tween 2010 and 2011 in the mas­ter bed­room, while his younger daugh­ter was watch­ing TV in the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>After hav­ing un­pro­tected sex with her, the man told her not to tell any­one about the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>She did not know the na­ture of the sex­ual acts at the time, and it was only when she was about nine years old that she be­gan to re­alise the ac­tions were wrong.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, the vic­tim com­plied with the ac­cused’s sex­ual de­mands there­after be­cause the ac­cused is her fa­ther and she loved him,” Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Jane Lim told the court.</p>
    <p>The girl also did not want to get her fa­ther into trou­ble or risk break­ing up the fam­ily, said the DPP.</p>
    <p>The of­fences came to light in De­cem­ber 2017 when the girl was in­ter­viewed by po­lice of­fi­cers for an­other case.</p>
    <p>BLISS­FUL LIFE RU­INED</p>
    <p>This was an age where the vic­tim should be en­joy­ing ’’ a bliss­ful and care­free life.</p>
    <p>HIGH COURT JUDGE DEDAR SINGH GILL, dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
