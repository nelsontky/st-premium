    <p>There is cer­tainly room for dis­cus­sion on how Sin­ga­pore can move to­wards a race-blind so­ci­ety, and on the role of race-based poli­cies like the Eth­nic In­te­gra­tion Pol­icy (EIP), said Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong.</p>
    <p>But in hav­ing such dis­cus­sions, Sin­ga­pore­ans should not for­get the “over­ar­ch­ing and over­rid­ing” con­cerns – to build a na­tion that re­spects each race, and that ev­ery race has a place at the table and shares the com­mon Sin­ga­pore iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong was re­spond­ing to Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim yes­ter­day dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim had on Tues­day called for a na­tional ex­er­cise to dis­cuss how Sin­ga­pore’s jour­ney to­wards be­com­ing a race-blind so­ci­ety can be has­tened, and pro­posed an open re­view of race-based poli­cies such as the EIP and eth­nic self-help groups.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Tong cau­tioned that while Sin­ga­pore has be­come less race-con­scious and more tol­er­ant of dif­fer­ences, Sin­ga­pore­ans must not think that they have ar­rived at an ideal “post-racial state”, or that no more ef­fort will be needed to bridge dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>To this, Ms Lim clar­i­fied that she does not take Sin­ga­pore’s mul­tira­cial­ism for granted, and ac­knowl­edged the dif­fi­cul­ties the Govern­ment faces in fos­ter­ing a Sin­ga­pore iden­tity in a het­ero­ge­neous pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“But at the same time, I think my point was that we should not keep talking our­selves down or be held back by the past,” she said, adding she was call­ing for Sin­ga­pore to re­fresh its con­ver­sa­tions on mat­ters of race from time to time, as it can­not be “os­si­fied by the past”.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing, Mr Tong as­sured Ms Lim that the Govern­ment’s mind is not closed on is­sues of race.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing the over­rid­ing con­cerns on the mat­ter, he said: “And within that con­straint, we can have the con­ver­sa­tions that Ms Lim spoke about, we can look at the pri­or­i­ties that she spoke about and we can look at the dif­fer­ent con­sid­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim then re­it­er­ated her con­cerns about the EIP, not­ing the pol­icy has in some in­stances led to eco­nomic hard­ship for mi­nor­ity fam­i­lies due to lim­i­ta­tions placed on them when they try to sell their flats.</p>
    <p>The EIP spec­i­fies the pro­por­tion of units in a Hous­ing Board block and precinct that can be owned by a par­tic­u­lar racial group to en­sure a balanced mix. If a block reaches an eth­nic quota for the Chi­nese race, for in­stance, a mi­nor­ity seller can sell the flat to only peo­ple from mi­nor­ity races, which may re­duce the pool of po­ten­tial buy­ers.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy, Ms Lim feared, could lead to fes­ter­ing re­sent­ment if un­hap­pi­ness over such eco­nomic con­se­quences is not ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong replied that the Govern­ment will con­sider the trade-offs of the pol­icy, while tak­ing into ac­count its pur­pose and ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>The de­bate on race con­tin­ued af­ter Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Ma­liki Os­man’s speech, with Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran and Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Janil Puthuc­heary also weigh­ing in.</p>
    <p>On eth­nic self-help groups, Ms Lim ac­knowl­edged the good work done by these groups, but asked if sim­i­lar or bet­ter out­comes can be achieved by amal­ga­mat­ing the groups un­der one na­tional um­brella.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Dr Ma­liki said that while the self-help groups work to­gether on dif­fer­ent plat­forms, hav­ing unique self-help groups en­ables them to bet­ter serve their re­spec­tive com­mu­ni­ties, as they have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of each com­mu­nity’s cul­tural nu­ances and his­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran, who was the first chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Sin­ga­pore In­dian De­vel­op­ment As­so­ci­a­tion, said that self-help groups have not been “os­si­fied”, but rather have evolved ac­cord­ing to the needs of the dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>He asked if Ms Lim was as­sert­ing that Sin­ga­pore is bet­ter off with­out the self-help groups.</p>
    <p>To this, Ms Lim said she was not im­ply­ing this. Rather, she had called for an open con­ver­sa­tion on whether the self-help groups should re­main dis­tinct.</p>
