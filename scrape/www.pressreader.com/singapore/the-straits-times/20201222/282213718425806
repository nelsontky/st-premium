    <p>De­spite the eco­nomic fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the Or­chard Road Christ­mas light-up re­mains a bright spot in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It has gone ahead as planned this year, with re­tail ex­perts say­ing it will give the shop­ping belt a boost.</p>
    <p>But Ms Es­ther Ho, di­rec­tor of Nanyang Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness Man­age­ment, noted that un­like in pre­vi­ous fi­nan­cial crises, “the eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic is more per­va­sive and long­drawn”.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has hit the tourism, hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail and food and bev­er­age sec­tors par­tic­u­larly hard,” she said.</p>
    <p>As busi­nesses are not cer­tain of any im­me­di­ate turn­around, they are “less likely to spend on their fa­cades and in-store dec­o­ra­tions”, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho also ob­served that some dec­o­ra­tive el­e­ments such as ban­ners and flags ap­pear to be miss­ing in this year’s light-up.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Amos Tan, se­nior lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness, said that since the end of the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis that be­gan in 2008, sub­tler Christ­mas light-ups in Or­chard Road have be­come the norm and it is harder to gauge how the econ­omy is do­ing based on the light-up alone.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, the Or­chard Road light-up was a “very good in­di­ca­tor of the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy”, added Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Still, there is rea­son to cheer dur­ing this fes­tive pe­riod, as Or­chard Road is all aglow with a win­try dis­play of snowflakes, mistle­toe and holly, even though there is no street fair ow­ing to Covid-19 con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said more lo­cals can be ex­pected to flock to the light-up this year “to soak in the fes­tive mood”.</p>
    <p>“In De­cem­ber, peo­ple tend to travel and shop over­seas. But now that this is not pos­si­ble, Or­chard Road is the first place they have in mind dur­ing Christ­mas,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho said that with the eas­ing of more safe man­age­ment mea­sures, “there are more rea­sons to shop and dine in Or­chard Road”.</p>
    <p>The Or­chard Road light-up has been an an­nual tra­di­tion since 1984, and Sin­ga­pore has not turned off the lights de­spite hard times.</p>
    <p>2008 GLOBAL FI­NAN­CIAL CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>Although the theme of 2008’s Christ­mas light-up was A Sweet Christ­mas, not all shop­pers found the dec­o­ra­tions taste­ful.</p>
    <p>A poll of 50 shop­pers and tourists con­ducted by The Straits Times at the time found that 34 of them thought that the dec­o­ra­tions were not as spec­tac­u­lar as those in pre­vi­ous years.</p>
    <p>That year, fairy lights flashed blue and green above the traf­fic, while red hearts dan­gled from street lamps dec­o­rated to re­sem­ble candy canes.</p>
    <p>2001 DOT.COM RE­CES­SION</p>
    <p>Some say that although the dot.com bub­ble burst in the late 1990s, its im­pact was felt in Sin­ga­pore only in 2001 when there was a tech­ni­cal re­ces­sion – de­fined as two con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of neg­a­tive growth.</p>
    <p>But there was a sil­ver lin­ing that year for those in town.</p>
    <p>About 80,000 sil­ver cylin­ders were strung high above Or­chard Road, glit­ter­ing in the day and il­lu­mi­nated by flood lights at night.</p>
    <p>Made of pa­per, the cylin­ders were the brain­child of French light­ing mas­ter Louis Clair.</p>
    <p>Themed “Frozen Au­rora”, the light-up was meant to repli­cate colour­ful lights streak­ing across the win­try skies in the North Pole.</p>
    <p>But it got a luke­warm re­cep­tion, with some find­ing the light-up plain. Even so, oth­ers felt that the lights “bring on the Christ­mas ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>1998 ASIAN FI­NAN­CIAL CRI­SIS</p>
    <p>De­spite the down­turn caused by the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, about 900,000 light bulbs bright­ened up Sin­ga­pore’s most fa­mous shop­ping belt along Tan­glin Road, Or­chard Road and in the Scotts Road area.</p>
    <p>It brought cheer to many. Ms Sher­a­lyn Goh, then a 20-year-old stu­dent at Te­masek Polytech­nic, was re­ported as say­ing she was “sur­prised to see the lights... and they made the place look bet­ter”.</p>
    <p>All the trees in Or­chard Road were decked out in tinsel while a toy train decor rode high above the junc­tion of Scotts Road and Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>1985 RE­CES­SION</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore suf­fered its first post-in­de­pen­dence re­ces­sion in 1985, but the Christ­mas lights con­tin­ued to shine bright.</p>
    <p>They wowed peo­ple, so much so that the light-up lasted for 37 days, com­pared with 20 days the year be­fore when it was in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>The comet herald­ing the birth of Je­sus Christ dom­i­nated the dec­o­ra­tions ow­ing to the ex­cite­ment over the im­pend­ing ap­pear­ance of Hal­ley’s Comet – which oc­curred in April 1986.</p>
    <p>Mr Shudesh Kumar, an 18-yearold se­cu­rity guard at the time, was re­ported as say­ing that pho­tog­ra­phers camped out­side a shop­ping cen­tre where Paragon now stands, snap­ping away un­til 4am.</p>
