    <p>So the ral­ly­ing cry for Wine RVLT, a wine bar in Car­pen­ter Street, is</p>
    <p>Mak­ing Sin­ga­pore Drink Again.</p>
    <p>Did Sin­ga­pore stop drink­ing?</p>
    <p>Oops.I did not get that memo.</p>
    <p>I have known founders Ian Lim, 36, and Alvin Gho, 39, for years, from their pre­vi­ous som­me­lier jobs. But for some rea­son, have never been to their 55-seat bar. Dur­ing lock­down, they sold fan­tas­tic do-it-your­self kits for peo­ple to make their sig­na­ture pasta and patty melts at home.</p>
    <p>I cooked. I was hooked.</p>
    <p>So, just after the bar’s third birth­day, I check out the new menu by chef Sunny Leong, 30, for­merly of Cor­ner House. The fo­cus is now de­cid­edly Asian, with some un­ex­pected gems. One of these is Wild Span­ner Crab With Dashi Crys­tal Bread And Caviar ($36, right, above). The bread comes from the fer­tile imag­i­na­tion of Al­bert Adria, brother of Fer­ran, of el Bulli fame. In Sin­ga­pore, chef Leong uses dashi and starch to make the crys­talline, hol­low bread. The crab and caviar look like they are sit­ting on a rec­tan­gu­lar block of ice. I take a bite gin­gerly, ex­pect­ing the whole thing to fall to pieces all over my dress. It does not.</p>
    <p>I am en­chanted.</p>
    <p>Things only get bet­ter. Air-dried Beef Tartare ($30) tells your taste­buds you are in Sin­ga­pore. It is mixed with ginger and scal­lion and the acid in the dress­ing is rice wine. Steak tartare with a chicken rice vibe. I love the pa­per-thin slices of eringi mush­room on co­conut-kaf­fir flat­bread ($22), amped up with onion con­fit and Comte cheese aged 24 months.</p>
    <p>Buck­wheat spaghetti ($38) is a lit­tle like soba and comes with monk­fish liver, smoked Bou­chot mus­sels and caviar. Salty, creamy and briny. The ankimo, how­ever, is elu­sive.</p>
    <p>To stave off food coma, or­der the perky Cala­mansi Tart ($16) for dessert.</p>
    <p>Put your­self in the hands of either Mr Lim or Mr Gho when de­cid­ing what to drink. Or pe­ruse the “wine list”, bot­tles lin­ing the wall of the bar. My friend and I left it to the own­ers and we were in­tro­duced to some cap­i­tal drops.</p>
    <p>My favourites of the night were</p>
    <p>Lit­tle Bas­tard 2018 ($105) from the Mosel wine re­gion of Ger­many, with its un­ex­pected fizzi­ness; and Pheas­ant’s Tears Rkat­siteli 2018 ($105), made in the Re­pub­lic of Ge­or­gia and fer­mented in qvevri, earth­en­ware ves­sels lined with beeswax, and buried in the ground.</p>
    <p>When, I won­der, can we travel again? Can you tell? I have Ge­or­gia on my mind. Un­til we get our wings back, I will rely on Mr Lim and Mr Gho to take me places, in stem­less wine glasses.</p>
