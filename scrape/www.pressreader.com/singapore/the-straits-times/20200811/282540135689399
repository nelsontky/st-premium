    <p>PITTSFIELD (Mas­sachusetts) • A hard rain thrummed on the roof of a fes­ti­val tent. Nine masked per­form­ers, speech­less, stared in­tently at cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old ac­tor play­ing the Son of God, Ni­cholas Ed­wards, made it mid­way through the God­spell bal­lad Beau­ti­ful City when, ris­ing to sing a lyric about re­build­ing, he burst into tears.</p>
    <p>It had been a long first week, and not just be­cause there was so much to mem­o­rise.</p>
    <p>There were the nasal swabs, the tem­per­a­ture checks, the lock­downs and the face cov­er­ings. And now, there were tape mea­sures to dou­ble-check dis­tances and translu­cent screens to en­close backup singers. Still to come were cos­tume pock­ets to stash hand sani­tiser.</p>
    <p>The re­hearsal halted. The key­boardist stopped play­ing. Ed­wards buried his head un­der his tank top.</p>
    <p>“In the real world, we would come over and hug you,” said di­rec­tor Alan Fil­der­man. But com­ply­ing with the rules of the day, he did not rise from his seat. Nor did the other ac­tors, who ex­tended air hugs in­stead.</p>
    <p>Ed­wards took a mo­ment, col­lected him­self and fin­ished the scene. “As I started to sing, ‘When your trust is all but shat­tered’, that took me out, re­ally hear­ing that,” he later ex­plained. “We’ve lost all faith and trust in one an­other and trust in the theatre. Will it ever come back?”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic emp­tied stages across the United States in March, as lo­cal of­fi­cials banned large gath­er­ings and the na­tion­wide theatre ac­tors’ union barred its mem­bers from per­form­ing.</p>
    <p>Now, for the first time in the coun­try, some union ac­tors are re­turn­ing to the stage – two stages, ac­tu­ally, both lo­cated in the Berk­shires, a trea­sured sum­mer cul­tural desti­na­tion in Western Mas­sachusetts.</p>
    <p>The two pro­duc­tions in Pittsfield – God­spell at Berk­shire Theatre Group and the one-per­son play Harry Clarke at Bar­ring­ton Stage Com­pany – are de facto pub­lic health ex­per­i­ments. If they suc­ceed, they could be a model for pro­fes­sional theatre dur­ing this pe­riod of peril. But if ac­tors or au­di­ence mem­bers get sick, that would be a se­ri­ous set­back.</p>
    <p>“The whole in­dus­try needs this,” said Ms Kate Shin­dle, pres­i­dent of</p>
    <p>Ac­tors’ Eq­uity As­so­ci­a­tion, the labour union rep­re­sent­ing 51,000 per­form­ers and stage man­agers.</p>
    <p>Ms Shin­dle, who planned to at­tend the God­spell open­ing last Fri­day, video-called the mu­si­cal’s ac­tors on their first day of re­hearsal with a message of en­cour­age­ment and of cau­tion.</p>
    <p>“Not to put any pres­sure on you, but the en­tire Amer­i­can theatre is de­pend­ing on you to be re­ally smart,” she said. “Peo­ple are going to look to you to know that theatre can hap­pen without any­body get­ting sick.”</p>
    <p>Eq­uity agreed to al­low the two Berk­shire pro­duc­tions be­cause the num­ber of re­ported coro­n­avirus cases in Western Mas­sachusetts is low and be­cause the the­atres agreed to im­ple­ment a dizzy­ing ar­ray of pro­phy­lac­tic mea­sures for work­ers and au­di­ence mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The month-long pro­duc­tion of God­spell, with 10 roles, is the more com­plex un­der­tak­ing be­cause of the cast size and the per­ils of singing, which pro­duces po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous aerosols.</p>
    <p>The 1971 mu­si­cal re­mains enor­mously pop­u­lar, with nearly 10,000 pro­duc­tions over the past two decades.</p>
    <p>Adapted from the Gospel of Matthew, the show fo­cuses on Je­sus’ uses of para­bles as a teach­ing tool. It has been staged in many ways (at a refugee camp, in a prison, among home­less squat­ters) and this pro­duc­tion is set dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­ble on­stage health mea­sures – par­ti­tions, masks, so­cial dis­tanc­ing – “be­come part of the para­ble of be­ing a moral per­son”, said the show’s light­ing de­signer Matthew Adel­son.</p>
    <p>The act­ing com­pany – 12 per­form­ers, in­clud­ing two un­der­stud­ies – ranges in age from 20 to 34. A few have Broad­way ex­pe­ri­ence, but most are at ear­lier stages of their ca­reers. At least three, in­clud­ing Ed­wards, have had the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>They are ex­u­ber­antly grate­ful to be work­ing. “I’m just so ex­cited to per­form for peo­ple again,” said Na­jah Hets­berger, a 20-year-old mu­si­cal theatre stu­dent at Mont­clair State Univer­sity. “I haven’t done that for months.”</p>
