    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion (SBF) chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ho Meng Kit will re­tire on Jan 1 af­ter 10 years of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness cham­ber an­nounced yes­ter­day that the 64-year-old, who was ap­pointed in 2011, will con­tinue to help SBF as a se­nior ad­viser.</p>
    <p>Deputy CEO Lam Yi Young, 48, who joined the cham­ber in July, will take over as CEO.</p>
    <p>In the 10 years Mr Ho has been at the helm, SBF’s membership has grown nearly 50 per cent, from 18,400 in 2011 to 27,200 to­day.</p>
    <p>He has also deep­ened the cham­ber’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties in ar­eas such as ad­vo­cacy, in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion, busi­ness fa­cil­i­ta­tion and ca­pac­ity build­ing, and spear­headed ini­tia­tives in sec­tors such as sus­tain­abil­ity and cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity, the SBF said.</p>
    <p>Be­fore join­ing the cham­ber, Mr Ho served var­i­ous roles in the civil ser­vice such as prin­ci­pal pri­vate sec­re­tary to then Se­nior Min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew and manag­ing di­rec­tor of the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing thanked Mr Ho for his ded­i­ca­tion in lead­ing the cham­ber over the past decade.</p>
    <p>He also con­grat­u­lated Mr Lam on his ap­point­ment, adding: “I look for­ward to strength­en­ing our part­ner­ships with SBF and other trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers, to ad­dress the short-term chal­lenges faced by the busi­ness com­mu­nity while po­si­tion­ing them to build stronger and deeper ca­pa­bil­i­ties to re­main re­silient amidst the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Mr Ho said the cham­ber has con­stantly adapted it­self to meet the needs and as­pi­ra­tions of mem­bers, and has worked to bet­ter un­der­stand key is­sues and fa­cil­i­tate deeper col­lab­o­ra­tions and ex­changes with gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>These ef­forts have trans­lated to more busi­ness for its mem­bers, he added.</p>
    <p>“I am hon­oured to have had the op­por­tu­nity of work­ing along­side many ded­i­cated part­ners, both from the pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors. Their strong com­mit­ment and sup­port have en­abled SBF to suc­cess­fully im­ple­ment key ini­tia­tives and pro­grammes,” Mr Ho said.</p>
    <p>Be­fore join­ing the SBF ear­lier this year, Mr Lam spent 24 years in the civil ser­vice, tak­ing on roles such as deputy sec­re­tary for in­dus­try in the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try as well as chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“As Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to work to­wards an eco­nomic re­cov­ery post-Covid-19, there is much that SBF will need to con­tinue do­ing to help our com­pa­nies emerge stronger,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We will keep our mem­bers at the fore­front of our mis­sion and cham­pion their needs both lo­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally,” he added.</p>
