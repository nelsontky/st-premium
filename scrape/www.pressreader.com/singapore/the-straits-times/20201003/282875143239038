    <p>As a site di­rec­tor re­spon­si­ble for en­sur­ing the work safety of his col­leagues at global, re­search-based bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing firm Ab­bVie Sin­ga­pore, a day in the of­fice for Mr Srid­har Do­rai is noth­ing short of event­ful.</p>
    <p>On top of keep­ing op­er­a­tions un­in­ter­rupted so that a steady stream of medicines reach pa­tients, he also en­sures phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal prod­ucts meet qual­ity and reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>And when the Covid-19 pan­demic hit Sin­ga­pore, Mr Do­rai had to con­vene the cri­sis man­age­ment team and put in place a plan to pro­tect the health of his col­leagues. As the sit­u­a­tion wors­ened, the com­pany was al­ways a step ahead in im­ple­ment­ing mea­sures, like the use of face masks on the site and mov­ing con­tract work­ers out of dor­mi­to­ries to Covid-safe ac­com­mo­da­tions such as ho­tels to help re­duce the spread of the virus — well be­fore most com­pa­nies did.</p>
    <p>Car­ing for peo­ple and pa­tients</p>
    <p>Ab­bVie Sin­ga­pore’s foot­print here in­cludes a man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­ity pro­duc­ing ther­a­pies for on­col­ogy and im­munol­ogy treat­ment and com­mer­cial of­fices over­see­ing the Ja­pan and Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>As its em­ployee, Mr Do­rai has en­joyed sev­eral ca­reer high­lights, in­clud­ing be­ing part of the 2015 pi­o­neer team to start up Ab­bVie’s Sin­ga­pore op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“See­ing all our hard work come to fruition was re­ally ful­fill­ing,” he re­calls. “In par­tic­u­lar, when we hosted our chair­man, ex­ec­u­tive lead­er­ship and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials at the open­ing cer­e­monies of our Ac­tive Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal In­gre­di­ent (API) and Bi­o­log­ics plants in 2016 and 2017 re­spec­tively.”</p>
    <p>While these mile­stones have been mem­o­rable, it is the peo­ple Mr Do­rai lead that mat­ter most. One of his ut­most pri­or­i­ties is keep­ing his team mo­ti­vated, and the fact that his work has a di­rect im­pact on pa­tients’ lives and their loved ones makes his job es­pe­cially mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>“We strive to cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment where em­ploy­ees can ap­pro­pri­ately ex­per­i­ment and move good ideas for­ward, while pro­vid­ing them op­por­tu­ni­ties to learn and de­velop,” he shares.</p>
    <p>To com­mu­ni­cate com­pany ob­jec­tives trans­par­ently, reg­u­lar town hall meet­ings and break­fast with lead­ers are held. These en­cour­age open and hon­est di­a­logues be­tween man­age­ment and staff.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 still be­ing clas­si­fied as a pan­demic, Mr Do­rai be­lieves there are plenty of op­por­tu­ni­ties for prospec­tive job-seek­ers who want to make a re­mark­able im­pact on peo­ple’s lives by pur­su­ing a ca­reer in life sciences. This is es­pe­cially since com­pa­nies in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try are work­ing hard to de­velop vac­cines as well as fast and ac­cu­rate test kits.</p>
    <p>“There are still a lot of un­met med­i­cal needs in­volv­ing se­ri­ous health is­sues, which re­quire com­pa­nies to re­search and find new ways to ad­dress,” he says.</p>
    <p>We strive to cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment where em­ploy­ees can ap­pro­pri­ately ex­per­i­ment and move good ideas for­ward, while pro­vid­ing them op­por­tu­ni­ties to learn and de­velop.</p>
