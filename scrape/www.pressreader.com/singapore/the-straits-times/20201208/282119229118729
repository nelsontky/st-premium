    <p>The col­lapse of a ven­ti­la­tion duct in a Nex mall cin­ema in Au­gust was due to “a sig­nif­i­cant amount of wa­ter” ac­cu­mu­lat­ing in the in­su­la­tion ma­te­rial sur­round­ing the duct.</p>
    <p>This was the find­ing of a probe fol­low­ing the Aug 30 in­ci­dent at a Shaw The­atres cin­ema hall which left two movie­go­ers in­jured, the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The wa­ter ac­cu­mu­la­tion was a re­sult of “un­fore­seen ex­ces­sive con­den­sa­tion over a sus­tained pe­riod”, and its weight had over­loaded the air-con­di­tion­ing and me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion (ACMV) drop­per duct.</p>
    <p>This had over­loaded the brack­ets sup­port­ing the ACMV duct, caus­ing it to give way.</p>
    <p>The acous­tic ma­te­rial sur­round­ing the duct typ­i­cally serves to reg­u­late the sur­face tem­per­a­ture around it to pre­vent wa­ter from form­ing due to con­den­sa­tion, and to in­su­late the noise caused by air trav­el­ling through it.</p>
    <p>Checks on other cin­e­mas’ sys­tems and ducts found no such ex­ces­sive con­den­sa­tion, said BCA.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Nex, which is owned and man­aged by Gold Ridge, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day it will “con­tinue to sup­port and work closely with (its) ten­ant, Shaw The­atres, through­out the course of rec­ti­fi­ca­tions for the planned reopen­ing of their premises next year”.</p>
    <p>It did not say if checks on other ACMV ducts in the build­ing will be con­ducted.</p>
    <p>Shaw The­atres yes­ter­day said it will work with Gold Ridge to carry out the nec­es­sary rec­ti­fi­ca­tion works to en­sure such an in­ci­dent will not hap­pen again. The works will be su­per­vised by a pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer the build­ing owner has ap­pointed, as in­structed by BCA.</p>
    <p>Build­ing own­ers are re­spon­si­ble by law to main­tain their build­ings, in­clud­ing in­te­rior fix­tures.</p>
    <p>Shaw The­atres said it is tar­get­ing to re­open its Nex cin­ema out­let next April. It had con­ducted in­spec­tions at its six cine­plexes fol­low­ing the in­ci­dent, and all were found to be safe.</p>
    <p>BCA added that it will be is­su­ing an ad­vi­sory to build­ing own­ers and the in­dus­try on the im­por­tance of reg­u­lar main­te­nance and to share good prac­tices for the de­sign and in­stal­la­tion of ACMV sys­tems.</p>
