    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-based de­vel­oper of Is­lamic smart­phone ap­pli­ca­tion Mus­lim Pro has de­nied al­le­ga­tions that it is sell­ing the per­sonal data of users to the United States mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>App de­vel­oper Bits­me­dia told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that it will im­me­di­ately ter­mi­nate its re­la­tion­ships with its data part­ners, with­out spec­i­fy­ing who they are.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Vice Me­dia report on Mon­day, the US mil­i­tary is buy­ing pri­vate in­for­ma­tion gath­ered from apps around the world, in­clud­ing Mus­lim Pro, which has over 98 mil­lion down­loads and fea­tures ser­vices like prayer times.</p>
    <p>“This is in­cor­rect and un­true. The pro­tec­tion and re­spect of the pri­vacy of our users is Mus­lim Pro’s ut­most priority,” said Miss Za­hariah Ju­pary, its head of com­mu­nity. “We ad­here to the most strin­gent pri­vacy stan­dards and data pro­tec­tion reg­u­la­tions, and never share any per­sonal iden­ti­fi­able in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>It has launched an in­ter­nal investigat­ion and is re­view­ing its data gov­er­nance pol­icy to con­firm that all user data was han­dled prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Vice had re­ported that the US mil­i­tary bought Mus­lim Pro’s data through a third-party data bro­ker called X-Mode. Data bro­kers col­lect data or buy it from other com­pa­nies. The data re­port­edly bought in­cluded lo­ca­tion in­for­ma­tion, the name of the Wi-Fi net­work a user was con­nected to, a time­stamp, and in­for­ma­tion about the phone the apps are in­stalled on.</p>
    <p>Miss Za­hariah said Mus­lim Pro had started work­ing with X-Mode four weeks ago, but has since ter­mi­nated any co­op­er­a­tion with the firm and other “data part­ners”. She did not dis­close what ex­actly X-Mode was work­ing with Bits­me­dia on.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) said, in re­sponse to ST queries, that it does not have over­sight over apps like Mus­lim Pro and does not pro­vide any sup­port for them.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age the Mus­lim com­mu­nity to ex­er­cise care when us­ing such apps,” said a Muis spokesman, adding that this in­cludes be­ing care­ful about the per­sonal in­for­ma­tion they reveal, terms and con­di­tions of us­ing the apps, and con­tent the apps pro­vide.</p>
    <p>He said Muis app Mus­lim SG provides in­for­ma­tion such as prayer times, halal cer­ti­fied food out­lets and mosque lo­ca­tions.</p>
