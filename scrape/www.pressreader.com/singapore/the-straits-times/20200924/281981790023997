    <p>SYD­NEY • Most of the pi­lot whales from a 470-strong pod f ound stranded off Aus­tralia’s re­mote south­ern coast have died, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day, as rescuers strug­gled in freez­ing wa­ters and fad­ing light to free those still alive.</p>
    <p>The group, which is the big­gest beach­ing in the coun­try’s mod­ern his­tory, was first spot­ted on a wide sand­bank dur­ing an ae­rial re­con­nais­sance of rugged Mac­quarie Har­bour in Tas­ma­nia state on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two days of a dif­fi­cult and dan­ger­ous res­cue at­tempt, state marine sci­en­tists said at least 380 of the long-finned pi­lot whales had died. By late yes­ter­day, around 50 of the mam­mals had been freed but ex­perts said there was a high like­li­hood they would re­turn, as many did dur­ing the res­cue at­tempt a day ear­lier, cre­at­ing an ex­haust­ing loop for rescuers who can­not work through the night.</p>
    <p>The out­look for the re­main­ing 30 stranded and still alive pi­lot whales, a species of oceanic dol­phin that grow to 7m long and can weigh up to three tonnes, was bleak.</p>
    <p>“As time goes on, they do be­come fa­tigued and their chance of sur­vival re­duces,” Mr Nic Deka, Parks and Wildlife Ser­vice in­ci­dent con­troller, said. “We do ex­pect to res­cue more but in­creas­ingly our fo­cus is what do with the car­casses.”</p>
    <p>A res­cue crew of 60 con­ser­va­tion­ists, skilled vol­un­teers and lo­cal fish farm work­ers has spent two days wad­ing in the cold shal­lows to free the still liv­ing crea­tures, us­ing boats fit­ted with spe­cial slings to guide the whales back to the open ocean.</p>
    <p>The re­float­ing process in­volves as many as four or five peo­ple per whale wad­ing waist-deep in freez­ing water, at­tach­ing slings to the an­i­mals so they can be guided out of the har­bour by a boat.</p>
    <p>“They’re fo­cused on the job – it’s de­mand­ing work, some of them are up to their chest in cold water so we’re try­ing to ro­tate the crews,” Mr Deka said.</p>
    <p>“Its very drain­ing phys­i­cally. It’s also drain­ing emo­tion­ally.”</p>
    <p>The whales have been found stranded up to 10km apart, and of­fi­cials have now ex­panded their search area to see if more of the mam­mals are stuck nearby.</p>
    <p>“As time goes on (the whales) do be­come more fa­tigued so their chances of sur­vival re­duces,” Mr Deka said. “But we’ll keep work­ing as long as there are live an­i­mals at the site.”</p>
    <p>The strand­ing, about 200km north-west of the state cap­i­tal Ho­bart, is the big­gest on record in mod­ern Aus­tralia and one of the largest in the world, draw­ing at­ten­tion to a natural phe­nom­e­non that re­mains a mys­tery to sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>“It’s cer­tainly a ma­jor event and of great con­cern when we po­ten­tially lose that many whales out of a strand­ing event,” Pro­fes­sor Peter Har­ri­son from the South­ern Cross Univer­sity Whale Re­search Group said. “Quite of­ten we only get to re­ally see them when there are bad out­comes, such as this strand­ing. We ab­so­lutely need some more in­vest­ment in re­search to un­der­stand these whales in Aus­tralian wa­ters.”</p>
    <p>In 1996, 320 pi­lot whales washed up on the coast of West­ern Aus­tralia, in what was then re­ported to be the coun­try’s big­gest mass strand­ing. About 600 pi­lot whales beached in nearby New Zealand in 2017.</p>
