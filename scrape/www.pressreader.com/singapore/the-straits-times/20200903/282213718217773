    <p>On Sun­day, an air-con­di­tion­ing ven­ti­la­tion duct came crash­ing down from the ceil­ing of a Shaw The­atres cin­ema hall in Nex mall and landed on cin­ema­go­ers, in­jur­ing two of them.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the dra­matic crash, a deaf­en­ing si­lence fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>Since this is a mat­ter of pub­lic safety, it is use­ful to list the unan­swered ques­tions for pub­lic aware­ness and dis­cus­sion, some four days af­ter the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>There are at least five unan­swered ques­tions.</p>
    <p>1 WHAT HAP­PENED?</p>
    <p>Cin­ema op­er­a­tor Shaw The­atres said that the ven­ti­la­tion duct had “dis­lodged”.</p>
    <p>Build­ing safety reg­u­la­tor Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) gave an equally di­alled-down re­ply, call­ing it “the in­ci­dent of the fallen air-con­di­tion­ing and me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion (ACMV) duct”.</p>
    <p>These ver­sions do not square with the scale of what hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Pho­tos of the af­ter­math cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial media showed the duct land­ing on more than 10 seats across three rows, with what re­mained of it above sus­pended pre­car­i­ously in midair.</p>
    <p>How big and heavy was the duct? Were there se­cu­rity cam­eras that cap­tured what hap­pened? The po­lice were seen in­ter­view­ing some pa­trons – what did the eye­wit­nesses say?</p>
    <p>These ques­tions ought to have been able to be an­swered quickly, but they re­main unan­swered.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>HOW DID THE DUCT DIS­LODGE?</p>
    <p>When asked on Mon­day for de­tails of its pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tion, the</p>
    <p>BCA said that the build­ing owner has ap­pointed a pro­fes­sional en­gi­neer (PE) to con­duct a de­tailed in­ves­ti­ga­tion, in­clud­ing in­spect­ing and as­sess­ing the con­di­tion of other ducts in the cin­ema.</p>
    <p>The agency told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “Build­ing own­ers are responsibl­e for the main­te­nance of their build­ings, by en­sur­ing that all parts of their build­ings are main­tained in a state of good or ser­vice­able con­di­tion. (The) main­te­nance of in­te­rior fit­tings such as ACMV ducts within build­ings is not sub­ject to reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments.”</p>
    <p>The BCA added that it will “carry out an in­de­pen­dent as­sess­ment and re­view the find­ings of the PE, to en­sure that the rec­ti­fi­ca­tion mea­sures (rec­om­mended by the PE) are ap­pro­pri­ate”.</p>
    <p>Some in­dus­try ex­perts have sug­gested weak­en­ing duct sup­ports, loose nuts and bolts or spalling con­crete slabs as pos­si­ble causes.</p>
    <p>But be­yond these pos­si­ble causes are broader ques­tions that the BCA also has to ad­dress, in­clud­ing whether there was any de­sign, in­stal­la­tion or main­te­nance lapse that brought down the duct.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>WHAT IS BE­ING DONE TO PRE­VENT SUCH DUCTS FROM FALL­ING AGAIN?</p>
    <p>Shaw The­atres said on Tues­day that it is tak­ing the pre­cau­tion­ary step of in­spect­ing the halls at all of its six</p>
    <p>other cin­ema lo­ca­tions that are cur­rently in op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>While the move is use­ful, it raises the ques­tion of whether fur­ther steps are necessary be­yond what the cin­ema op­er­a­tor is do­ing as a pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>The dis­lodged duct in Nex comes squarely un­der build­ing safety law, and it is in the pub­lic in­ter­est for the BCA to ex­er­cise its power to pre­vent an in­ci­dent like this from hap­pen­ing again.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>WHO IS RESPONSIBL­E FOR WHAT HAP­PENED – THE BUILD­ING OWNER OR TEN­ANT?</p>
    <p>Ms Ong Pei Ching, lit­i­ga­tion part­ner at TSMP Law Corp, told ST that a busi­ness has a duty to pre­vent cus­tomers from be­ing hurt by un­usual dan­gers on the premises.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter if the busi­ness is it­self a ten­ant of the premises. So long as the busi­ness has con­trol over the premises, the busi­ness is responsibl­e for the safety of its cus­tomers,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But if the cus­tomers are in­jured by some­thing that is un­der the con­trol of the land­lord, not the ten­ant, then the land­lord may be the one who is legally li­able.”</p>
    <p>She added: “In gen­eral, if you want your cus­tomers to pa­tro­n­ise your premises, then you must be responsibl­e for their safety.”</p>
    <p>So far, Shaw The­atres, not Nex mall owner Gold Ridge, has borne the sear­ing dis­com­fort of the pub­lic spotlight.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle is known about Gold Ridge, but pub­lic records show that it has a heavy­weight backer.</p>
    <p>Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity records re­vealed that the company has</p>
    <p>a paid-up cap­i­tal of more than</p>
    <p>$337 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Half of the company is owned by Yun­nan Gold (Mau­ri­tius), a company with an ad­dress in Mau­ri­tius.</p>
    <p>The other half is owned by Mer­ca­tus Tres, a home-grown company reg­is­tered in 2011. While its name may not be fa­mil­iar to some read­ers, its owner Mer­ca­tus Co-op­er­a­tive is the real es­tate sub­sidiary of multi-in­dus­try giant NTUC En­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>In other words, the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) owns half of Nex mall.</p>
    <p>This makes Nex’s owner not just any other mall owner, but one that is synony­mous with the labour move­ment and the every­man. Ar­guably, it bears a greater de­gree of pub­lic re­spon­si­bil­ity and ac­count­abil­ity than other com­mer­cial play­ers.</p>
    <p>A Mer­ca­tus spokesman told ST yes­ter­day that it was “con­cerned to learn of the un­for­tu­nate in­ci­dent” and is “work­ing in close col­lab­o­ra­tion with the mall man­age­ment and Shaw The­atres to</p>
    <p>de­ter­mine the cause of this in­ci­dent”.</p>
    <p>5 FI­NALLY, WHAT RE­DRESS IS THERE FOR THE TWO VIC­TIMS?</p>
    <p>TSMP’s Ms Ong said: “If a cus­tomer pa­tro­n­ises a busi­ness premises, and is in­jured by some­thing in the premises, then the cus­tomer can sue the busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences law lec­turer Ben Ch­ester Cheong said that an in­jured cin­ema pa­tron may be able to sue the cin­ema op­er­a­tor or the owner of the shop­ping mall, or both.</p>
    <p>“Since the in­jury took place within the cin­ema, the claim should be di­rected against the cin­ema op­er­a­tor first, fol­lowed by the owner of the shop­ping mall.</p>
    <p>“The cin­ema op­er­a­tor and the owner of the shop­ping mall have a duty of care to pro­tect pa­trons from in­jury and ac­ci­dents that are fore­see­able,” he added.</p>
    <p>For the two vic­tims, I am hope­ful that they will get well soon and re­ceive fair com­pen­sa­tion even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>But for all con­cerned par­ties, call­ing this an “in­ci­dent” di­min­ishes the grav­ity of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The dis­lodged duct is a re­minder to build­ing own­ers to take im­me­di­ate steps to en­sure the safety of the pub­lic, and to the BCA to get to the bot­tom of what hap­pened and make its own find­ings pub­lic.</p>
    <p>All these have to be done with­out de­lay, and be­fore the next duct comes crash­ing down.</p>
    <p>Be­yond these pos­si­ble causes are broader ques­tions that the BCA also has to ad­dress, in­clud­ing whether there was any de­sign, in­stal­la­tion or main­te­nance lapse that brought down the duct.</p>
