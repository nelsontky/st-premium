    <p>US Sec­re­tary of the Navy Ken­neth Braith­waite met De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen on Fri­day and reaf­firmed the ex­cel­lent and long-stand­ing bi­lat­eral de­fence re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries, said the Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def).</p>
    <p>The two lead­ers also dis­cussed re­gional se­cu­rity is­sues and ways to strengthen navy-to-navy co­op­er­a­tion un­der the re­cently re­newed 1990 Me­moran­dum of Un­der­stand­ing Re­gard­ing United States Use of Fa­cil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Braith­waite, the US Navy’s top civil­ian leader who was ap­pointed in May, was on a two-day in­tro­duc­tory visit to Sin­ga­pore as part of his trip to the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>He had ear­lier met US sailors at the Yoko­suka Naval Base and called on Ja­panese De­fence Min­is­ter Nobuo Kishi in Tokyo. He is also sched­uled to visit Guam and Palau.</p>
    <p>As part of his Sin­ga­pore visit, Mr Braith­waite also met Chief of De­fence Force, Lieu­tenant-Gen­eral</p>
    <p>Melvyn Ong, said Min­def in a state­ment on Fri­day. Mr Braith­waite also vis­ited Changi Naval Base.</p>
    <p>His visit high­lights the strong part­ner­ship be­tween the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy (RSN) and the US Navy, said Min­def, adding that health checks and other safety mea­sures were taken by the vis­it­ing del­e­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Both navies in­ter­act reg­u­larly through bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral ex­er­cises, cross-at­ten­dance of cour­ses, and other pro­fes­sional ex­changes.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently in Au­gust, the RSN par­tic­i­pated in the mul­ti­lat­eral Rim of the Pa­cific Ex­er­cise, hosted by the US Navy and held in the wa­ters off Hawaii, said Min­def.</p>
    <p>“These in­ter­ac­tions strengthen the in­ter­op­er­abil­ity and co­op­er­a­tion, as well as bol­ster mu­tual un­der­stand­ing be­tween the two navies,” it added.</p>
