    <p>De­spite Covid-19 cases tripling to over 36,400 in Malaysia since Oct 1, the gov­ern­ment is re­sist­ing “to­tal lock­down”, say­ing it has learnt how to curb the coro­n­avirus with tar­geted mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported 1,009 new in­fec­tions and six deaths yes­ter­day, with 564 new cases in Sabah alone, bring­ing the na­tional to­tal to 36,433 and the death toll to 277.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment (Spe­cial Func­tions) Mohd Redzuan Md Yu­sof said yes­ter­day: “A to­tal lock­down is un­nec­es­sary be­cause we are now at the re­cov­ery stage with an exit pol­icy.”</p>
    <p>“The coun­try’s cri­sis man­age­ment has suc­ceeded in con­trol­ling the spread of Covid-19 and pre­vent­ing health fa­cil­i­ties such as hos­pi­tals and clin­ics from be­ing over­bur­dened with a high num­ber of cases,” he added in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Redzuan was re­spond­ing to Barisan Na­sional MP Shahi­dan Kas­sim, who asked the gov­ern­ment to ex­plain why it has yet to en­force the move­ment con­trol or­der de­spite the rise in coro­n­avirus cases, es­pe­cially in Sabah and sev­eral other red zones on the penin­sula.</p>
    <p>Mr Redzuan added that the gov­ern­ment would con­sider en­forc­ing strict move­ment curbs again if the in­fec­tion rate sur­passes the re­cov­ery rate.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment is more prone to­wards im­ple­ment­ing a bal­ance-type of con­trols,” he said, re­fer­ring to mea­sures that con­tain the virus while en­sur­ing the sus­tain­abil­ity of liveli­hoods. “This in­cludes ed­u­cat­ing the peo­ple to em­brace the new nor­mal, such as ex­er­cis­ing phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and prac­tis­ing good hy­giene such as clean­ing hands fre­quently us­ing soap or sani­tiser.”</p>
    <p>Sabah is set to hold a by-elec­tion in Batu Sapi on Dec 5, fol­low­ing the death of state op­po­si­tion MP Liew Vui Keong.</p>
    <p>Sarawak, which holds its state elec­tions ev­ery five years sep­a­rately from the gen­eral elec­tion, is due to hold its next polls in the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>De facto Law Min­is­ter Takiyud­din Has­san said yes­ter­day that the Fed­eral Constituti­on al­lows for a state of emer­gency to be in­voked in Sabah and Sarawak to post­pone the elec­tions if the out­break wors­ens. “If it ap­pears nec­es­sary, the gov­ern­ment might con­sider it. In terms of the Constituti­on, it can be done,” he said.</p>
