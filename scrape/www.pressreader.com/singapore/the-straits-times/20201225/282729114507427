    <p>WHO: Dr Yanyun Chen (left), 34, re­cently re­ceived the Young Artist Award, given out by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil to arts prac­ti­tion­ers aged 35 and younger. The vis­ual artist, best known for her re­al­is­tic char­coal sketched flow­ers, is a mul­ti­tasker who also teaches full-time at the Yale-NUS Col­lege. She is work­ing on her next ex­hi­bi­tion, Gen­tly Sav­age, which re­sponds to her late teacher French philoso­pher Anne Du­four­man­telle’s works on gen­tle­ness. It is sched­uled to show in Paris next year.</p>
    <p>My morn­ing rou­tine is pretty much fixed. I am up be­fore 8am, my cat Darth Meow gets his break­fast, groom­ing and med­i­ca­tion, and I have my cof­fee.</p>
    <p>While the caf­feine takes ef­fect, I am plough­ing through e-mail, sort­ing out daily tasks and do­ing chores. I have un­wit­tingly de­vel­oped an in­ter­mit­tent fast­ing habit in the last decade as I never ate break­fast, so my first meal of the day is at noon.</p>
    <p>On week­ends, my af­ter­noons are one of three things: de­vel­op­ing new works, pole and aerial train­ing or (though rarely) catch­ing up with friends.</p>
    <p>As my week­days are filled with teach­ing and re­search-re­lated du­ties, the week­ends have be­come a very pre­cious time to de­vote to my art prac­tice. I’ve evolved into a bit of a pole junkie, so train­ing is a must.</p>
    <p>Some­times, I’ll be at­tend­ing ex­hi­bi­tions and shows, but be­ing an in­tro­verted her­mit, I tend to pre­fer stay­ing home to work.</p>
    <p>Din­ners are usu­ally home-cooked and I make sure my fridge is filled through­out the week. Com­mon in­gre­di­ents in my fridge in­clude seafood, av­o­cado, or­anges and veg­eta­bles. I usu­ally end the day with watch­ing anime or play­ing video games such as El­der Scrolls on­line or, most re­cently, Cy­ber­punk 2077.</p>
    <p>I take Darth Meow to visit my par­ents weekly and some­times that lands on a week­end. My fam­ily re­ally dotes on the fe­line brat, so he gets more treats and toys than he can man­age.</p>
