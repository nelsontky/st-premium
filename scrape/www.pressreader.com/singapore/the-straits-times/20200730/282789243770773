    <p>NEW YORK • Sev­eral t op mu­si­cians, in­clud­ing Mick Jag­ger and Sh­eryl Crow, have signed a let­ter de­mand­ing that Amer­i­can politi­cians get their con­sent be­fore play­ing their songs at cam­paign ral­lies.</p>
    <p>The sound­track to po­lit­i­cal events was a hot topic dur­ing the 2016 elec­tion and is again this year, with sev­eral stars ob­ject­ing to United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump play­ing their songs with­out per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Michael Stipe of REM, Regina Spek­tor and Aero­smith’s Steven Tyler were among oth­ers to put their names on the let­ter, which was writ­ten in part­ner­ship with the Artist Rights Al­liance, Rolling Stone mag­a­zine re­ported.</p>
    <p>“No artist should be forced to com­pro­mise their val­ues or be as­so­ci­ated with politi­cians they don’t re­spect or sup­port,” the al­liance tweeted on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“To de­fend free speech and po­lit­i­cal ex­pres­sion, we’re call­ing on cam­paigns to get per­mis­sion be­fore us­ing mu­sic at po­lit­i­cal events,” it added.</p>
    <p>Unauthoris­ed use of mu­sic is a long-es­tab­lished is­sue in Amer­i­can elec­tions. The 1984 re-elec­tion cam­paign of then Pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan used Bruce Spring­steen’s mu­sic af­ter the re­lease of Born In The USA.</p>
    <p>Spring­steen mused at con­certs later that year over whether or not Mr Rea­gan had lis­tened to the al­bum, which car­ried themes re­gard­ing veterans re­turn­ing from the Viet­nam War.</p>
    <p>Last month, Bri­tish rock leg­ends The Rolling Stones threat­ened le­gal ac­tion against Mr Trump for his use of their clas­sic, You Can’t Always Get What You Want, at cam­paign ral­lies.</p>
    <p>The same month, the fam­ily of rock mu­si­cian Tom Petty is­sued a cease-and-de­sist let­ter over Mr Trump’s use of I Won’t Back Down at a rally in Tulsa on June 20.</p>
    <p>Queen com­plained when Mr Trump walked on stage to their an­them, We Are The Cham­pi­ons, dur­ing a Repub­li­can Party event in Cleve­land, Ohio, in the run-up to the 2016 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Phar­rell Wil­liams, Ri­hanna, Aero­smith, Adele, Neil Young and the es­tate of the late singer Prince all have also hit out af­ter Mr Trump used their songs.</p>
    <p>Other sig­na­to­ries of the let­ter revealed on Tues­day in­clude Lionel Ritchie, Elvis Costello and bands Blondie, Green Day and Pearl Jam, Rolling Stone said.</p>
    <p>“For artists who do choose to en­gage po­lit­i­cally in cam­paigns or other con­texts, this kind of unauthoris­ed pub­lic use con­fuses their mes­sage and un­der­mines their ef­fec­tive­ness,” the al­liance said in its let­ter.</p>
    <p>“Mu­sic tells pow­er­ful sto­ries and drives emo­tional con­nec­tion and en­gage­ment – that’s why cam­paigns use it, af­ter all. But do­ing so with­out per­mis­sion siphons away that value.”</p>
