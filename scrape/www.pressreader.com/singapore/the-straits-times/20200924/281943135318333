    <p>WASHINGTON US Sec­re­tary of State Michael Pom­peo has been ramp­ing up his do­mes­tic ap­pear­ances be­fore over­whelm­ingly Repub­li­can au­di­ences, rais­ing crit­i­cism that he is go­ing on the cam­paign trail for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump by tak­ing part in events that pre­vi­ous top US diplo­mats would have avoided.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo was to be in Wis­con­sin yes­ter­day to ad­dress the Repub­li­can-con­trolled state leg­is­la­ture in a speech billed as warn­ing of the threat that states face from China’s Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>He is fol­low­ing a string of Repub­li­can visi­tors to the bat­tle­ground state, in­clud­ing Mr Trump, VicePres­i­dent Mike Pence and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr.</p>
    <p>The trip to speak in the state Mr Trump nar­rowly won in 2016 fol­lows his par­tic­i­pa­tion in a “Val­ues Vot­ers” event on Tues­day night, two speeches to a megachurch in Texas over the week­end and an ad­dress to the Repub­li­can National Con­ven­tion while on a tax­payer-funded trip to Jerusalem last month.</p>
    <p>The events have one thing in com­mon: They give Mr Pom­peo the op­por­tu­nity to dis­cuss ad­min­is­tra­tion for­eign pol­icy goals at home, while also boost­ing Mr Trump – and his own stand­ing with the Pres­i­dent’s po­lit­i­cal base ahead of a po­ten­tial run for the White House in 2024.</p>
    <p>“It’s clearly un­prece­dented in the mod­ern era and a clear vi­o­la­tion of es­tab­lished norms,” said Mr Daniel Weiner, deputy di­rec­tor of the election re­form pro­gramme at the Bren­nan Cen­tre for Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>“Pom­peo, for bet­ter or worse, has thrown that all out the win­dow and en­gaged in more overt po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­ity than any sec­re­tary in re­cent mem­ory,” Mr Weiner added.</p>
    <p>As former vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den so­lid­i­fied his stand­ing as the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee, the 56-yearold Mr Pom­peo men­tioned him more and more fre­quently in crit­i­cis­ing the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s poli­cies, a break from past re­straint against at­tack­ing pre­de­ces­sors’ for­eign-pol­icy records so openly.</p>
    <p>The sec­re­tary re­jects ac­cu­sa­tions that he is en­gag­ing in do­mes­tic pol­i­tics ahead of the Nov 3 election.</p>
    <p>At Pre­ston­wood Bap­tist Church in Texas last week­end, Mr Pom­peo said he is “not al­lowed to do pol­i­tics”.</p>
    <p>He has scoffed at re­porters who ask him about the trips, ac­cus­ing them of be­ing “coastal elites” who do not un­der­stand that he is try­ing to bring the depart­ment’s mes­sage to the Amer­i­can heart­land. He adds that his Christian faith is rel­e­vant be­cause it in­forms the way he does his job.</p>
    <p>A State Depart­ment spokesman, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, said Mr Pom­peo’s job is to lead the ex­e­cu­tion of Mr Trump’s for­eign pol­icy pri­or­i­ties and com­mu­ni­cat­ing that mes­sage di­rectly is an im­por­tant part of his task.</p>
