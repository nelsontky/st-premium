    <p>BERLIN • BioNTech is work­ing flat out with its part­ner Pfizer to boost pro­duc­tion of their Covid-19 vac­cine, its founders said, warn­ing of gaps in sup­ply un­til other vac­cines were rolled out.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man biotech start-up has led the vac­cine race, but its shot has been slow to ar­rive in the Euro­pean Union due to rel­a­tively slow ap­proval from the bloc’s health reg­u­la­tor and the small size of the or­der placed by Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>The de­lays have caused con­ster­na­tion in Ger­many, where some re­gions had to tem­po­rar­ily close vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres af­ter the launch of an in­oc­u­la­tion drive on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, it doesn’t look good – a hole is ap­pear­ing be­cause there’s a lack of other ap­proved vac­cines and we have to fill the gap with our own vac­cine,” BioNTech chief ex­ec­u­tive Ugur Sahin told the news weekly Spiegel.</p>
    <p>A shot from Moderna is ex­pected to be cleared by the Euro­pean Medicines Agency on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Health Min­is­ter Jens Spahn has urged the Euro­pean Medicines Agency to also quickly ap­prove a vac­cine de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca that Bri­tain has cleared. The EU time­line for that treat­ment re­mains un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin said the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, which uses mes­sen­ger RNA to in­struct the hu­man im­mune sys­tem to fight the coronaviru­s, should be able to cope with a vari­ant first de­tected in Bri­tain that seems to be more con­ta­gious.</p>
    <p>“We are test­ing whether our vac­cine can also neu­tralise this vari­ant, and will soon know more,” he said.</p>
    <p>Asked about cop­ing with a strong mu­ta­tion in the virus, he said it would be pos­si­ble to tweak the vac­cine as re­quired within six weeks – though such new treat­ments might re­quire ad­di­tional reg­u­la­tory ap­provals.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin founded BioNTech with his wife, Dr Oe­zlem Tuereci, who is the com­pany’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer. Both faulted the EU’s de­ci­sion to spread or­ders in the ex­pec­ta­tion that more vac­cines would be quickly ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The United States or­dered 600 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine last July, while the EU waited un­til Novem­ber to place an or­der of half that size.</p>
    <p>“At some point it be­came clear that it would not be pos­si­ble to de­liver so quickly,” Dr Tuereci told Spiegel. “By then it was al­ready too late to place fol­low-on or­ders.”</p>
    <p>BioNTech hopes to launch a new pro­duc­tion line in Mar­burg, Ger­many, next month that could pro­duce 250 mil­lion doses in the first half of the year, said Dr Sahin.</p>
    <p>Talks are un­der way with con­tract man­u­fac­tur­ers on boost­ing pro­duc­tion and there should be greater clar­ity by the end of the month, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin also said that BioNTech would make its vac­cine, which re­quires stor­age at around mi­nus 70 deg C, eas­ier to han­dle. A next-gen­er­a­tion vac­cine that would keep at higher tem­per­a­tures could be ready by late sum­mer.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, it doesn’t look good – a hole is ap­pear­ing be­cause there’s a lack of other ap­proved vac­cines and we have to fill the gap with our own vac­cine.</p>
