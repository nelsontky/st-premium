    <p>While Covid-19 con­tin­ues its as­sault on the world, I am re­minded of the con­cept of “One Health” – that the health of hu­mans, an­i­mals and the en­vi­ron­ment are linked and de­pen­dent on one an­other.</p>
    <p>In his lat­est doc­u­men­tary, A Life On Our Planet, Sir David At­ten­bor­ough re­minds us of the im­por­tance of the nat­u­ral world and how hu­mankind has to work with na­ture and not against it.</p>
    <p>Yet, there is no doubt we are al­ready in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, and hu­mans have re­gret­tably con­trib­uted to this.</p>
    <p>In just 40 years, the hu­man pop­u­la­tion has in­creased more than twofold to 7.8 bil­lion, while wild ar­eas have been halved to cover just 35 per cent of our planet’s land masses.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists es­ti­mate that nearly 200 species of plants and an­i­mals go ex­tinct ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Civil­i­sa­tion de­pends on the nat­u­ral world to pro­vide us with clean air and wa­ter, and shield us from diseases. This dev­as­tat­ing loss of bio­di­ver­sity there­fore has cas­cad­ing con­se­quences on hu­man lives, phys­i­cally and men­tally.</p>
    <p>But we can still re­verse it. Hu­mans have played a part to bring back species like the Ara­bian oryx and black-footed fer­ret in con­ser­va­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, the en­dan­gered Tas­ma­nian devils – once found on main­land Aus­tralia and later, in the wild only in Tas­ma­nia – were re­leased back to a pro­tected na­tional park on the main­land for the first time in 3,000 years.</p>
    <p>In 1989, then Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Mar­garet Thatcher ad­dressed the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly, warn­ing of the dan­gers of man-made cli­mate change. She said: “Today, we have learnt rather more hu­mil­ity and re­spect for the bal­ance of na­ture.”</p>
    <p>She called on hu­man­ity to use “rea­son” – sci­ence – “to find a way in which we can live with na­ture, and not dom­i­nate na­ture”.</p>
    <p>As a so­ci­ety, we must con­tin­u­ally re­flect on whether we are do­ing enough, de­spite the knowl­edge we hold.</p>
    <p>The clock is tick­ing. While con­ser­va­tion­ists, sci­en­tists and many oth­ers are fight­ing this bat­tle, they need more of us to stand with them.</p>
    <p>A CITY IN NA­TURE</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s early years of na­tion build­ing, the Gov­ern­ment’s pri­or­ity was to de­liver homes and jobs to peo­ple. There was a need to de­velop vast in­fra­struc­ture to con­nect peo­ple and build an econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew also made a clean and green Sin­ga­pore a pri­or­ity of his gov­ern­ment poli­cies. And over time, we have be­come more con­scious of balanc­ing var­i­ous needs: land to de­velop, for our econ­omy to con­tinue to pros­per, and the need to be stew­ards of our nat­u­ral her­itage.</p>
    <p>Clean­ing our rivers brought our ot­ters back, af­ter a dis­ap­pear­ance of over a few decades. They now thrive as a re­sult of strong wildlife pro­tec­tion laws, as well as the civic-mind­ed­ness of Sin­ga­pore­ans who value, in­deed wel­come, wild an­i­mals to share their liv­ing space. It thrills me to see how in­ter­ested peo­ple have be­come in our is­land’s ot­ter pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Wild ori­en­tal pied horn­bills, ex­tinct in Sin­ga­pore by 1855, made a sur­pris­ing comeback in 1994, first on Pu­lau Ubin and then on main­land Sin­ga­pore af­ter great ef­forts went into bring­ing them back.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of this con­ser­va­tion story was made pos­si­ble only with col­lab­o­ra­tion among the Na­tional Parks Board, Wildlife Re­serves Sin­ga­pore (WRS), re­searchers and pas­sion­ate cit­i­zen sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The crit­i­cally en­dan­gered straw-headed bul­bul is also thriv­ing, and Sin­ga­pore is one of the last stronghold­s of a healthy wild pop­u­la­tion of this species glob­ally.</p>
    <p>As one of the few zoos hold­ing a col­lec­tion of this species, Jurong Bird Park was ap­pointed in­ter­na­tional species co­or­di­na­tor to man­age the global pop­u­la­tion un­der hu­man care. The zoo is play­ing a lead­ing role in con­ser­va­tion breed­ing to save this highly threat­ened species.</p>
    <p>De­spite our ur­banised en­vi­ron­ment, our Lit­tle Red Dot’s bio­di­ver­sity and con­ser­va­tion ef­forts are richer than many give us credit for, and we must as­pire to do more for the world we live in.</p>
    <p>BE­YOND A ‘GREEN CITY’</p>
    <p>FOR A SUS­TAIN­ABLE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Per­haps be­cause Sin­ga­pore is one of the most ur­banised and land-scarce city states in the world, with vir­tu­ally no nat­u­ral re­sources of our own, we work harder and go to greater lengths to be self-suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>With sus­tain­abil­ity be­ing adopted as a cor­ner­stone of gov­ern­ment pol­icy, Sin­ga­pore is ranked amongst the world’s most in­no­va­tive and en­vi­ron­men­tally ad­vanced cities.</p>
    <p>In many ways, we are in the best po­si­tion to be a model of a bio­philic city, where the coun­try’s leg­is­la­ture and in­fras­truc­tural devel­op­ment as well as the cit­i­zens’ val­ues con­verge to al­low peo­ple and wildlife to live in har­mony and thrive to­gether.</p>
    <p>But we need more than gov­ern­ments to re­verse and re­duce the stress mankind has put on nat­u­ral re­sources. Busi­nesses can put sus­tain­abil­ity at their core, while in­di­vid­u­als can make con­scious choices daily as part of their per­sonal en­deav­our to change the way we live.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, a re­cent Con­ser­va­tion Sen­ti­ments Sur­vey con­ducted by WRS in­di­cated that Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents say in­di­vid­u­als have the big­gest role to play in wildlife con­ser­va­tion, af­ter the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also showed that our young are twice as in­clined to take ac­tion for wildlife con­ser­va­tion than older Sin­ga­pore­ans. That is heart­en­ing news in­deed.</p>
    <p>But there re­mains much more to do as less than half the re­spon­dents could cor­rectly iden­tify the Sunda pan­golin, lesser mouse deer and straw-headed bul­bul as crea­tures na­tive to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>We need to en­sure our peo­ple know our nat­u­ral world like they know our built world.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine the col­lec­tive im­pact if ev­ery­one in­spired one an­other to take sim­ple steps for the en­vi­ron­ment – choose sus­tain­ably sourced prod­ucts; sup­port sus­tain­able lo­cal busi­nesses; and buy only what you need.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing be­hav­iours can be chal­leng­ing, but aware­ness is the first step to change.</p>
    <p>As the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion in charge, what is the fu­ture we hope to leave for our chil­dren, our chil­dren’s chil­dren and their chil­dren?</p>
    <p>With more than half of the world’s pop­u­la­tion now liv­ing in ur­ban ar­eas, it has re­sulted in what is termed as “na­ture deficit dis­or­der”. This de­scribes how the lack of ex­po­sure to na­ture neg­a­tively im­pacts our be­hav­iour, par­tic­u­larly that of chil­dren today, who are less likely to be con­nected to na­ture than any other gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Our ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum should in­cor­po­rate more na­ture-based learn­ing to in­stil love and re­spect for flora and fauna from a young age.</p>
    <p>The hope is that this em­pa­thy for na­ture be­comes an in­trin­sic value they carry well into their adult­hood, and one they will pass on to sub­se­quent gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore. We must con­tinue to cul­ti­vate fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of pas­sion­ate and ded­i­cated in­di­vid­u­als who de­vote their lives to shap­ing out­comes and mak­ing a dif­fer­ence for na­ture in ur­ban cities for sus­tain­able fu­tures.</p>
    <p>Today, we know them as “species he­roes” – Sin­ga­pore’s na­ture com­mu­nity and wildlife pro­tec­tors who con­trib­ute to this pur­pose – and we owe them our thanks.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have al­ways ap­pre­ci­ated their nat­u­ral sur­round­ings, even if, for many, that ap­pre­ci­a­tion is a quiet one. Sin­ga­pore’s rapid progress has also led to a dis­con­nect – be­tween know­ing of the ex­is­tence of the nat­u­ral world and ac­tu­ally ex­pe­ri­enc­ing it.</p>
    <p>The beauty of the chal­lenge be­fore us is that we need not travel to the far­thest reaches of the world in the man­ner of Mr At­ten­bor­ough to re­dress that. It can be as sim­ple a step as spend­ing more time in pub­lic parks and na­ture re­serves, or vis­it­ing the zoos, to con­nect with na­ture.</p>
    <p>Per­haps one of the up­sides of not be­ing able to travel abroad in re­cent months is that we have the op­por­tu­nity to reac­quaint our­selves with the nat­u­ral parts of Sin­ga­pore. Only when we form an emo­tional con­nec­tion with na­ture will we have the im­pe­tus to act.</p>
    <p>Na­ture does not work by al­low­ing one species to dom­i­nate over all oth­ers – hu­man­ity in­cluded.</p>
    <p>We can be a peo­ple and a city that are a force for na­ture, by act­ing in our own ways to min­imise the im­pact we have on our nat­u­ral world and help it thrive again.</p>
