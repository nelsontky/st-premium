    <p>In a split de­ci­sion, the three-judge Court of Ap­peal in Sin­ga­pore has ruled that there was a breach of nat­u­ral jus­tice in the mak­ing of bank­ruptcy-re­lated or­ders against a busi­ness­man and his fam­ily by an In­done­sian court.</p>
    <p>These or­ders – against Mr Paulus Tan­nos, his wife Lina Rawung and their chil­dren Pauline and Cather­ine – were ear­lier recog­nised by the High Court of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The four are In­done­sians, but hold Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dency and re­side here.</p>
    <p>The High Court de­ci­sion was even­tu­ally over­turned by the apex court, with Chief Jus­tice Sundaresh Menon and Judge of Ap­peal Tay Yong Kwang hold­ing that the fam­ily had not been given a fair op­por­tu­nity to con­test the court pro­ceed­ings in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Jus­tice Woo Bih Li dis­agreed, find­ing that they had ear­lier known of the court pro­ceed­ings but chose not to at­tend.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian me­dia re­ports state that Mr Tan­nos is al­legedly a sus­pect in an on­go­ing cor­rup­tion case in his home coun­try that in­volves an In­done­sian gov­ern­ment project on the coun­try’s elec­tronic na­tional iden­tity cards.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the judg­ment by the apex court dated Aug 27, the busi­ness­man is a ma­jor­ity share­holder of In­done­sian com­pany Me­galestari Ung­gul (MLU).</p>
    <p>In 2011, MLU was granted a loan of 200 bil­lion ru­piah (S$18.5 mil­lion) by an­other In­done­sian com­pany, with the Tan­nos fam­ily al</p>
    <p>LEFT WITH NO AV­ENUE</p>
    <p>leg­edly the guar­an­tors of the loan.</p>
    <p>MLU was un­able to re­pay the loan in 2012. The debt was even­tu­ally as­signed to a third In­done­sian com­pany – Senja Imaji Prisma (SIP) – and two in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2016, SIP be­gan le­gal pro­ceed­ings in In­done­sia against MLU and the Tan­nos fam­ily over the debt, urg­ing the court to make Pe­nun­daan Ke­wa­jiban Pem­ba­yaran Utang (PKPU) pre­bankruptcy or­ders against them.</p>
    <p>Un­der In­done­sian law, a PKPU or­der tem­po­rar­ily sus­pends the re­pay­ment obli­ga­tions of a debtor so that it can pro­pose a loan re­struc­tur­ing plan to its cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>SIP sub­se­quently at­tempted to serve no­tice of the pro­ceed­ings to the Tan­nos fam­ily at their reg­is­tered ad­dress in In­done­sia, but the de­liv­ery failed due to an “in­com­plete ad­dress”, ac­cord­ing to the records of the In­done­sian courier com­pany.</p>
    <p>The pro­ceed­ings were also ad­ver­tised in an In­done­sian news­pa­per with lim­ited cir­cu­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The or­ders were later is­sued in the fam­ily’s ab­sence on Jan 9, 2017.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the fam­ily’s lawyers at­tended sub­se­quent meet­ings with the cred­i­tors, claim­ing that the fam­ily had not re­ceived any no­tice of the pre-bank­ruptcy pro­ceed­ings, among other things.</p>
    <p>As the meet­ings did not re­sult in a suc­cess­ful loan re­struc­tur­ing plan, the In­done­sian court later pro­nounced MLU in­sol­vent and the Tan­nos fam­ily bank­rupt.</p>
    <p>It also ap­pointed in­di­vid­u­als to ad­min­is­ter the in­sol­vency process and as re­ceivers and ad­min­is­tra­tors of the Tan­nos fam­ily’s es­tate, which in­cludes prop­erty in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The or­ders were recog­nised by the High Court of Sin­ga­pore in Jan­uary 2018, af­ter an ap­pli­ca­tion by the re­ceivers.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fail­ing to get the High Court to set aside its ear­lier recog­ni­tion of the In­done­sian court or­ders, the fam­ily ap­pealed to the apex court in Sin­ga­pore, claim­ing there were pend­ing appeals and re­views be­fore the Supreme Court of In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily also main­tained that they had learnt of the court pro­ceed­ings against them in In­done­sia only af­ter the or­ders were ad­ver­tised in two ma­jor In­done­sian news­pa­pers.</p>
    <p>The or­ders by the In­done­sian court were there­fore ob­tained in “breach of nat­u­ral jus­tice”, they ar­gued through their lawyers – Se­nior Coun­sel Philip Antony Je­yaret­nam and Lau Wen Jin.</p>
    <p>In their judg­ment, the Chief Jus­tice and Jus­tice Tay said that it would be il­log­i­cal for the fam­ily to have not ap­peared in court to con­test the mak­ing of the PKPU or­ders against them if they had ear­lier learnt about the pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>“In­deed, their con­duct at the cred­i­tors’ meet­ings and their sub­se­quent ef­forts to mount an ap­peal and seek re­view sug­gested that they were per­fectly com­mit­ted to seek­ing to vin­di­cate their rights be­fore the In­done­sian courts but were left with no av­enue to do so,” wrote the Chief Jus­tice, who de­liv­ered the ma­jor­ity de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Both the Chief Jus­tice and Jus­tice Tay also said that the Court of Ap­peal, in de­cid­ing whether the In­done­sian court or­ders were made in ac­cor­dance with the re­quire­ments of nat­u­ral jus­tice, is not bound by the views of the In­done­sian court.</p>
    <p>“As the (court or­ders) were to be recog­nised in Sin­ga­pore, it is for the Sin­ga­pore court to be sat­is­fied on the ev­i­dence that the man­ner in which the or­ders had been ob­tained com­plied with the core prin­ci­ples of nat­u­ral jus­tice,” wrote the Chief Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>In­deed, their con­duct at the cred­i­tors’ meet­ings and their sub­se­quent ef­forts to mount an ap­peal and seek re­view sug­gested that they were per­fectly com­mit­ted to seek­ing to vin­di­cate their rights be­fore the In­done­sian courts but were left with no av­enue to do so.</p>
