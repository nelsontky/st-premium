    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, Sin­ga­pore’s job mar­ket soft­ened sig­nif­i­cantly be­tween March and June – which cov­ered most of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when a lot of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity came to a stand­still. But the Min­istry of Man­power’s sec­ond-quar­ter labour mar­ket re­port this week was not all bad news. Al­though there were job cuts in all sec­tors, some proved more re­silient, and there was even net job cre­ation in some ar­eas. The head­line num­bers were, as ex­pected, grim. Be­tween March and June, the sea­son­ally ad­justed un­em­ploy­ment rate rose from 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent for Sin­ga­pore­ans and from 3.3 per cent to 3.8 per cent for res­i­dents. To­tal em­ploy­ment (ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers) fell by 103,500, the sharpest quar­terly con­trac­tion on record. This should not be a sur­prise, given that Sin­ga­pore has never had a three-month-long eco­nomic shut­down be­fore.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments more than dou­bled from the first quar­ter, al­though the num­bers were lower than in past re­ces­sion­ary peaks. The in­ci­dence of re­trench­ments, as a pro­por­tion of rel­a­tive work­force size, was lower for lo­cal em­ploy­ees than for for­eign­ers, partly the re­sult of the fact that wage sub­si­dies in the form of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) were con­fined to lo­cal em­ploy­ees. While un­em­ploy­ment rose across all age and ed­u­ca­tion groups, it was strik­ing that some were sig­nif­i­cantly more af­fected than oth­ers. No­tably, the un­em­ploy­ment rate was higher among res­i­dents 30 years of age and be­low and 60 years and above, and among those with­out ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>This might partly re­flect the higher rep­re­sen­ta­tion of these cat­e­gories of work­ers in front-line jobs that were most vul­ner­a­ble dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and in sec­tors most im­pacted, such as tourism, con­struc­tion, re­tail, en­ter­tain­ment and food and bev­er­age. But the trend does high­light two im­por­tant im­per­a­tives for pol­icy: One is to ex­tend the self-em­ployed worker in­come re­lief scheme, which is due to ex­pire next month, as many of those re­trenched would have joined the ranks of gig work­ers. The sec­ond is to re­dou­ble ef­forts, in­clud­ing through larger sub­si­dies, for trainee­ships and ap­pren­tice­ships.</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ingly, the fall in em­ploy­ment was largely not a re­sult of busi­ness clo­sures, which ac­counted for just 3.8 per cent of lo­cal job losses in the first half of the year. This sug­gests that com­pa­nies will start to re­hire once mar­ket con­di­tions im­prove – al­though the real test will come when wage sub­si­dies un­der the JSS ta­per off. How­ever, one of the sil­ver lin­ings of the cri­sis is that de­spite the global re­ces­sion and sim­mer­ing trade ten­sions, Sin­ga­pore has con­tin­ued to at­tract in­vestors, in­clud­ing most re­cently, Chi­nese tech giants, which bodes well for jobs over the next few years. So, while there may be more pain to come in the short term, over the medium term, the job mar­ket is likely to turn for the bet­ter.</p>
