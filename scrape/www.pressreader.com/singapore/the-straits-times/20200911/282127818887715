    <p>•</p>
    <p>LONDON A stalled global eco­nomic re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is lead­ing to a fresh build-up of global oil sup­plies, push­ing traders such as Trafigura to book tankers to store mil­lions of bar­rels of crude oil and re­fined fu­els at sea again.</p>
    <p>The use of so-called float­ing stor­age on board tankers comes as tra­di­tional on-shore stor­age re­mains close to ca­pac­ity as sup­plies out­pace de­mand.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing house Trafigura has char­tered at least five of the largest tankers, each ca­pa­ble of stor­ing two mil­lion bar­rels of oil, known as very large crude oil car­ri­ers, ac­cord­ing to trad­ing sources and ship­ping data.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of the ves­sels are newly built and are due to store gasoil and diesel, for which un­sold vol­umes are es­pe­cially high af­ter a mod­est re­cov­ery in mid-sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The in­ven­tory build-up comes de­spite ma­jor oil pro­duc­ers, in­clud­ing Saudi Ara­bia and Rus­sia, sharply cut­ting back out­put, and re­finer­ies slow­ing op­er­a­tions in re­cent months in re­sponse to an un­prece­dented drop in con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Other top traders, in­clud­ing Vi­tol, Li­tasco and Glen­core, have also, in re­cent days, booked large tankers to store diesel for up to 90 days, ac­cord­ing to ship­ping data and traders.</p>
    <p>Brent crude oil fu­tures are lan­guish­ing around US$40 a bar­rel af­ter post­ing their big­gest weekly de­cline since June.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket is soft and bear­ish, and float­ing stor­age is re­turn­ing again,” a mar­ket source said.</p>
    <p>The spread be­tween Brent crude for prompt de­liv­ery and six months in the fu­ture LCOc1-LCOc7 has been de­clin­ing steadily to­wards US$3, near lows last seen in late May.</p>
    <p>One trader sell­ing crude oil said:</p>
    <p>“Freight rates are low and the in­ter­month Brent spreads are now prob­a­bly wide enough to cover stor­age costs and cost of cash.”</p>
    <p>Mor­gan Stan­ley an­a­lyst Mar­tijn Rats said in a note: “It is in­creas­ingly clear that mar­ket fun­da­men­tals are not im­prov­ing as quickly as ex­pected, par­tic­u­larly on the de­mand side.”</p>
    <p>Global oil in­ven­to­ries re­main sharply above av­er­age when look­ing at re­cent years. Al­though stocks have drawn at a pace of around 1.6 mil­lion bar­rels per day over the past 30 days, they are still some 600 mil­lion bar­rels above last year’s lev­els, ac­cord­ing to Mor­gan Stan­ley.</p>
    <p>Most of the draws were in crude oil in­ven­to­ries, but re­fined prod­ucts stocks re­mained “stub­bornly” high, Mr Rats said.</p>
    <p>Com­pound­ing the bleak pic­ture are weak mar­gins and signs of an ero­sion in de­mand from China, whose record crude pur­chases in the sum­mer months – as it emerged from an eco­nomic lock­down to scoop up cheap oil – mit­i­gated de­mand dam­age glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Saudi oil gi­ant Aramco sharply cut its Oc­to­ber of­fi­cial sell­ing price for its flag­ship Arab Light crude to Asia by US$1.40 a bar­rel, hop­ing to sal­vage buy­ing in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>But one top Chi­nese buyer said the out­look ap­peared grim.</p>
    <p>“There are fewer re­fin­ery runs in China, teapots (in­de­pen­dent re­fin­ers) have used up a lot of their im­port quo­tas, in­ven­to­ries are still pretty high, and crude at cur­rent lev­els are not great for mar­gins.”</p>
    <p>Sag­ging crude fu­tures tracked sput­ter­ing phys­i­cal crude prices world­wide, as price dif­fer­en­tials for North Sea Brent stood at their low­est since June.</p>
    <p>West African oil sales suf­fered, with Nige­ria still seek­ing buy­ers for oil planned for ex­port last month, An­golan crude sell­ing at the low­est rates since May, and key buyer China re­selling un­wanted car­goes it re­ceived in term al­lo­ca­tions.</p>
