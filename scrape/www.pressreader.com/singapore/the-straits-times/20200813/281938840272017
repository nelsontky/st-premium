    <p>Most of Malaysia’s rul­ing par­ties have reg­is­tered as for­mal mem­bers of Perikatan Na­sional (PN) in a boost for Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin who is tus­sling with Umno for the up­per hand ahead of gen­eral elec­tions ex­pected within the next six months.</p>
    <p>Al­though Umno said last month that it will not be an of­fi­cial PN com­po­nent, sev­eral govern­ment of­fi­cials told The Straits Times that the coali­tion has since been ac­cepted by the Reg­is­trar of So­ci­eties and cru­cially in­cludes Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS), the Malaysian In­dian Congress (MIC) and Parti Ber­satu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS) de­spite these par­ties be­ing al­lied to Umno via other pacts.</p>
    <p>Umno, the largest party in Mr Muhyid­din’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, had led the Barisan Na­sional (BN) govern­ment for decades un­til it was de­feated in the 2018 elec­tion, af­ter which other par­ties aban­doned the coali­tion aside from MIC, the Malaysian Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion (MCA) and PBRS.</p>
    <p>It then part­nered PAS last year to set up the Muafakat Na­sional (MN) aimed at de­fend­ing the in­ter­ests of the Malay Mus­lim ma­jor­ity against al­leged ero­sion of their rights un­der the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) ad­min­is­tra­tion that was ousted in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>But PAS has openly backed Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) pres­i­dent Muhyid­din to re­main in power.</p>
    <p>“Not just BN, PAS and Ber­satu but all PN party lead­ers in­clud­ing MN... Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin is our prime min­is­ter can­di­date (for the next elec­tion),” PAS pres­i­dent Hadi Awang said last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>MCA is stay­ing out of PN for now, out of sol­i­dar­ity with its old­est ally Umno, and so is Sarawak’s dom­i­nant Parti Pe­saka Bu­mi­put­era Ber­satu (PBB), which left BN af­ter the 2018 polls de­feat and in­sists it will ally it­self to which­ever coali­tion that best serves the in­ter­est of the eastern state.</p>
    <p>But other for­mer BN par­ties, such as Sarawak United Peo­ple’s Party, the Pro­gres­sive Demo­cratic Party and Parti Ber­satu Sabah, have signed up to PN.</p>
    <p>“Umno still wants to lever­age on BN and MN. But PAS is not vy­ing to be PM and is happy to en­dorse Muhyid­din. It takes two hands to clap but PAS is not push­ing MN as an elec­tion plat­form,” an aide to an Umno min­is­ter told ST.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi’s state­ment on July 30 that it would not join PN came just days af­ter the party’s for­mer premier Na­jib Razak was con­victed on seven counts of graft over the 1MDB scan­dal.</p>
    <p>These de­vel­op­ments raised con­cerns over the sta­bil­ity of the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Na­jib is still widely in­flu­en­tial in Umno, the party that sup­plies the most num­ber of MPs to the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Zahid, him­self fac­ing a raft of cor­rup­tion charges, said: “Our sup­port to PN govern­ments is only via the BN law­mak­ers in the fed­eral govern­ment and sev­eral state govern­ments.”</p>
    <p>Jostling over what ban­ner rul­ing par­ties should en­ter the ex­pected snap polls – aimed at end­ing po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity stem­ming from Mr</p>
    <p>Muhyid­din’s nar­row par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity of 113 out of 222 MPs, the slimmest any Malaysian govern­ment has had – be­gan nearly im­me­di­ately af­ter PN took power in March.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Umno youth chief Asyraf Dusuki in­vited both PAS and Mr Muhyid­din’s Ber­satu to con­test un­der the widely recog­nised BN logo – a white weigh­ing scale against dark blue back­ground.</p>
    <p>But in an im­me­di­ate reaction, PAS trea­surer Iskan­dar Sa­mad said that com­ing to a com­mon un­der­stand­ing on elec­tion cam­paign­ing is more im­por­tant than the choice of logo.</p>
    <p>Umno, Ber­satu and PAS rep­re­sen­ta­tives have been ne­go­ti­at­ing since last month to over­come over­lap­ping claims in at least a quar­ter of con­stituen­cies na­tion­wide, as all three par­ties rep­re­sent the Malay Mus­lim ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu and Umno have also clashed over seats for the Sabah state elec­tions, which must be held by Septem­ber un­less the court rules next week that the dis­so­lu­tion of the state as­sem­bly was in­valid.</p>
    <p>A Ber­satu of­fi­cial told ST: “The Sabah polls could be a trial run for a Muhyid­din-led pact, as the state Umno has been weak­ened af­ter it lost in 2018.</p>
    <p>“If there is a big win for Muhyid­din, then the PM would want to ride the mo­men­tum and call for na­tional elec­tions as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Umno still wants to lever­age on BN and MN (Muafakat Na­sional) . But PAS is not vy­ing to be PM and is happy to en­dorse Muhyid­din. It takes two hands to clap but PAS is not push­ing MN as an elec­tion plat­form. ’’</p>
