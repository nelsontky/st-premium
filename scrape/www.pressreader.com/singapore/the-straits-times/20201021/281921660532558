    <p>French po­lice and mem­bers of the se­cu­rity ser­vices con­tinue to raid the homes of sus­pected rad­i­cals and of­fices of al­leged Is­lamic fun­da­men­tal­ist groups fol­low­ing the be­head­ing of a teacher who showed con­tro­ver­sial car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad to his stu­dents.</p>
    <p>And as French In­te­rior Min­is­ter Ger­ald Dar­manin has pointed out, the ap­prox­i­mately 40 sep­a­rate raids al­ready ex­e­cuted are likely to be con­tin­ued and ex­panded to a larger cir­cle of peo­ple or or­gan­i­sa­tions who may have ex­pressed sym­pa­thy for the teacher’s mur­der or of­fered jus­ti­fi­ca­tions for the crime.</p>
    <p>“We want to ha­rass and desta­bilise this move­ment in a very de­ter­mined way,” a spokesman for the In­te­rior Min­istry told lo­cal me­dia.</p>
    <p>Nor is the cam­paign con­fined to just ap­pre­hend­ing the im­me­di­ate “en­e­mies of the repub­lic”, as Mr Dar­manin put it.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron has vowed to push ahead with a broader and much more con­tro­ver­sial plan to com­bat re­li­gious separatism in pur­suit of what the French head of state claims to be the ob­jec­tive of</p>
    <p>“free­ing” Is­lam in France from “ex­trem­ist for­eign in­flu­ences”.</p>
    <p>He said: “Our chal­lenge is to fight against those who go off the rails in the name of re­li­gion… while pro­tect­ing those who be­lieve in Is­lam and are full cit­i­zens of the repub­lic.”</p>
    <p>Yet, although opin­ion polls in­di­cate that most French vot­ers sup­port this stated ob­jec­tive, the Pres­i­dent’s plan is likely to en­counter the same sort of dif­fi­cul­ties which scup­pered the ef­forts of his im­me­di­ate pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron, who came to power in 2017 fol­low­ing two years of re­peated and hor­rific ter­ror­ist at­tacks in France, was never in doubt that the in­te­gra­tion of his coun­try’s es­ti­mated six mil­lion Mus­lim cit­i­zens – around 8 per cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion – would prove to be one of his key chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>He started by ac­knowl­edg­ing that pre­vent­ing fur­ther ter­ror­ist out­rages was not merely a mat­ter of good in­tel­li­gence and vig­i­lance, but also one of tack­ling eco­nomic and so­cial marginal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause many of France’s young Mus­lims are stuck on the pe­riph­eries of towns, in ar­eas of de­cay­ing so­cial hous­ing and poor so­cial ser­vices, where un­em­ploy­ment is of­ten dou­ble the na­tional av­er­age.</p>
    <p>But over the past few months, Mr Macron’s po­si­tion ap­pears to have evolved from an ear­lier em­pha­sis on in­clu­sion to one of en­forc­ing mea­sures to “de­fend the repub­lic and its val­ues and en­sure it re­spects its promises of equal­ity and eman­ci­pa­tion”, as he put it re­cently.</p>
    <p>Cyn­ics have dis­missed the Pres­i­dent’s ap­par­ent hard­en­ing po­si­tion as mere pos­tur­ing; he faces re-elec­tion in 2022 and needs to pre­vent the far-right Na­tional Rally party from play­ing the anti-Is­lam card.</p>
    <p>But it is also clear that Mr Macron is re­spond­ing to grow­ing wor­ries in gov­ern­ment cir­cles about de­vel­op­ments within France’s Mus­lim com­mu­ni­ties. Of par­tic­u­lar con­cern are the ac­tiv­i­ties of coun­tries such as Al­ge­ria and Tur­key, which are fi­nanc­ing France’s mosques and Is­lamic cul­tural cen­tres and sup­ply­ing many of the imams.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties be­lieve this just in­creases the sep­a­ra­tion of France’s Mus­lims from main­stream so­cial cur­rents and ideas in their coun­try.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Macron wants Par­lia­ment to en­act laws by the end of this year, un­der which all the train­ing of imams will be done in France.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion will be se­ri­ously cur­tailed and there will be a crack­down on speech or ac­tiv­i­ties deemed to con­tra­dict so-called “French repub­li­can val­ues”. This ap­plies in par­tic­u­lar to a ban on gen­der seg­re­ga­tion at mu­nic­i­pal swim­ming pools, and ac­tiv­i­ties ad­vo­cat­ing a sep­a­ra­tion of cit­i­zens based on faith, sex, or po­lit­i­cal be­liefs.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron has spo­ken about his de­sire to pro­mote an “Is­lam of the En­light­en­ment”, one which is tol­er­ant and in­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>But many crit­ics be­lieve that his pro­posed mea­sures will not work.</p>
    <p>France has sought to train imams for decades, first in Morocco and more re­cently at home. Yet many of the truly ex­trem­ist Is­lamic teach­ers are home-grown rather than for­eign im­ports.</p>
    <p>Restrict­ing pri­vate re­li­gious ed­u­ca­tion is no panacea ei­ther, un­less this is re­placed with other school ac­tiv­i­ties on Is­lamic sub­jects which many par­ents want to pro­vide for their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But un­der the cur­rent Macron pro­posal, only €10 mil­lion (S$16 mil­lion) has been al­lo­cated to ex­tra Is­lamic teach­ing in state schools.</p>
    <p>And it is not ob­vi­ous how the French state, which is obliged by the Con­sti­tu­tion not to in­ter­vene in the in­ter­nal or­gan­i­sa­tion of re­li­gious com­mu­ni­ties, pro­poses to do so now.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent po­lice raids on al­leged ex­trem­ists are al­ready high­light­ing the le­gal dif­fi­cul­ties which lie ahead. One or­gan­i­sa­tion raided is the Col­lec­tive Against Is­lam­o­pho­bia in France, which has been la­belled “an en­emy of the state” by Mr Dar­manin. But the NGO, which mon­i­tors anti-Mus­lim hate crime in France, de­nies the charge and vows to chal­lenge the raids in court.</p>
