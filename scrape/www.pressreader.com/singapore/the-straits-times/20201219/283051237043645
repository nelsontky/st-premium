    <p>• The Rus­sian dop­ing scan­dal­boasted all the seedy in­gre­di­ents of a spy novel with whis­tle-blow­ers, drug cock­tails and un­der­cover chi­canery.</p>
    <p>In the early days of the Rus­sian state-spon­sored dop­ing scan­dal, with German broad­caster chan­nel ARD at the fore of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, key in­for­ma­tion came from Rus­sian mid­dle-dis­tance run­ner Yuliya Stepanova and her hus­band Vi­taly, the for­mer con­troller of Rusada, the coun­try’s anti-dop­ing agency.</p>
    <p>But the scan­dal ramped up in 2016 when sci­en­tist Grig­ory Rod­chenkov, forced to re­sign from the Moscow anti-dop­ing lab­o­ra­tory which he had headed since 2006, took refuge in the United States and piled on the rev­e­la­tions.</p>
    <p>A colour­ful char­ac­ter, the trou­bled mas­ter­mind turned in­for­mant con­fessed to hav­ing per­fected the dop­ing of Rus­sian ath­letes.</p>
    <p>As­sess­ing his “cred­i­bil­ity” was one of the chal­lenges of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion en­trusted in 2016 by World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada) to Cana­dian lawyer Richard McLaren, es­pe­cially as Rod­chenkov had a trou­bled and con­tro­ver­sial past.</p>
    <p>Rod­chenkov was the brains be­hind the “Duchess cock­tail” of steroids, com­pris­ing oxan­drolone, methenolon­e and tren­bolone.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes would use the mix­ture to al­low the in­ges­tion of drugs orally rather than through in­jec­tion. That way, it op­ti­mised the ef­fec­tive­ness of the drugs while lim­it­ing the risks of de­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Male ath­letes had to di­lute the three sub­stances in Chivas Re­gal whisky, gar­gle and spit it out. For fe­males, a bet­ter re­sult was to have it mixed in ver­mouth.</p>
    <p>The state-dop­ing ma­chine was cranked up to the max­i­mum when the Win­ter Olympics were staged at the Black Sea re­sort of Sochi in 2014.</p>
    <p>To de­ceive dope testers, Rod­chenkov de­scribed the role played by the feared FSB, the Rus­sian se­cret ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Games, an FSB agent, dis­guised as a plumber, used a “mouse hole” in the walls of the lab to switch drug-tainted sam­ples for clean spec­i­mens.</p>
    <p>The last episode which pushed Wada to trig­ger­ing the ban which was af­firmed on Thurs­day by the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport, dates back to 2018 when data from the Moscow lab­o­ra­tory for 2011-2015 that was sub­mit­ted to in­ves­ti­ga­tors was ma­nip­u­lated.</p>
