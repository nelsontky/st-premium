    <p>The global death toll from Covid-19 could dou­ble to two mil­lion be­fore a suc­cess­ful vac­cine is widely used, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) emer­gen­cies direc­tor Michael Ryan warned, as world lead­ers at the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly called for global unity to fight the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son was due yes­ter­day to pledge £340 mil­lion (S$597 mil­lion) in fund­ing for the WHO spread across four years and call for a re­vival of cross-border co­op­er­a­tion to re­pair “ugly rifts”.</p>
    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi pledged his coun­try’s vac­cine pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity would be made avail­able glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison in­sisted that any na­tion that de­vel­ops a Covid-19 vac­cine should share it uni­ver­sally, warn­ing that his­tory will be a “se­vere judge” if not.</p>
    <p>Latin Amer­i­can lead­ers also ap­pealed to the UN for free ac­cess to a fu­ture vac­cine, urg­ing ma­jor pow­ers to share their know-how for the sake of global well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>GENEVA/ZURICH • The global death toll from Covid-19 could dou­ble to two mil­lion be­fore a suc­cess­ful vac­cine is widely used and could be higher with­out con­certed ac­tion to curb the pan­demic, a World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>“One mil­lion is a ter­ri­ble num­ber and we need to re­flect on that be­fore we start con­sid­er­ing a sec­ond mil­lion,” the WHO’s emer­gen­cies direc­tor Michael Ryan told re­porters on Friday when asked how high the death toll could go. “Are</p>
    <p>we pre­pared col­lec­tively to do what it takes to avoid that num­ber?</p>
    <p>“Un­less we do it all, (two mil­lion deaths)... is not only imag­in­able but sadly very likely,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ryan’s com­ments came as world lead­ers at the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly called for global unity to fight the pan­demic, which has killed just un­der one mil­lion peo­ple and in­fected nearly 33 mil­lion glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son was due yes­ter­day to pledge £340 mil­lion (S$597 mil­lion) in fund­ing for the WHO spread across four years – a 30 per cent in­crease on the pre­vi­ous four-year com­mit­ment – with around a third of the money de­pen­dent on re­form in the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He will call for a re­vival of cross­bor­der co­op­er­a­tion and was due to present a five-point plan to im­prove the in­ter­na­tional re­sponse to fu­ture pan­demics.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter nine months of fight­ing Covid, the very no­tion of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity looks tat­tered,” says Mr John­son, ac­cord­ing to ad­vance ex­tracts dis­trib­uted by his of­fice. “Un­less we unite and turn our fire against our com­mon foe, we know that ev­ery­one will lose. Now is the time there­fore... for hu­man­ity to reach across bor­ders and re­pair th­ese ugly rifts.”</p>
    <p>His plan in­cludes a global net­work of re­search hubs and more vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>He will com­mit an ini­tial £71 mil­lion to the global vac­cine part­ner­ship known as Co­vax to se­cure pur­chase rights on 27 mil­lion doses, and £500 mil­lion to a sep­a­rate Co­vax ini­tia­tive to help poorer coun­tries ac­cess a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi pledged yes­ter­day that his coun­try’s vac­cine pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity would be made avail­able glob­ally to fight the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“In­dia’s vac­cine pro­duc­tion and de­liv­ery ca­pac­ity will be used to help all hu­man­ity in fight­ing this cri­sis,” he said in his recorded ad­dress to the UN assem­bly.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison on Friday in­sisted that any na­tion that de­vel­ops a Covid-19 vac­cine share it uni­ver­sally, warn­ing that his­tory will be a “se­vere judge” if not. His strongly worded ap­peal comes as the US, a his­toric ally of Australia, re­sists global ef­forts to col­lab­o­rate on a vac­cine. “When it comes to a vac­cine, Australia’s view is very clear – who­ever finds the vac­cine must share it,” he said in his video mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Latin Amer­i­can lead­ers also ap­pealed to the UN for free ac­cess to a fu­ture vac­cine, urg­ing ma­jor pow­ers to share their know-how for the sake of global well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Latin Amer­ica has taken a heavy blow from Covid-19 with nearly nine mil­lion cases and more than 330,000 deaths, one third of the global to­tal, ac­cord­ing to an Agence France-Presse tally based on of­fi­cial data. “With the pan­demic, as with poverty, no­body will be saved on their own,” Ar­gen­tine Pres­i­dent Al­berto Fer­nan­dez said.</p>
    <p>The Co­vax Fa­cil­ity is co­or­di­nated by the WHO and funded by it, with ad­di­tional fund­ing pro­vided by the United Na­tions chil­dren’s fund (Unicef), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion as well as the World Bank. More than 150 na­tions have joined the ini­tia­tive, which aims to have two bil­lion doses of a vac­cine ready for univer­sal dis­tri­bu­tion by late next year.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the pan­demic shows no signs of slow­ing. More than 200,000 peo­ple have died in the US, which has just over seven mil­lion cases, the high­est of any na­tion. On av­er­age, the coun­try is re­port­ing 44,000 new cases a day and about 700 deaths, with a surge in mid-western states wor­ry­ing health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>In­dia has emerged as a global coro­n­avirus hot spot that could po­ten­tially out­strip the US at the rate its daily cases are ris­ing. In the last 24 hours up to yes­ter­day, the coun­try added 85,362 new in­fec­tions, tak­ing the to­tal past 5.9 mil­lion cases.</p>
