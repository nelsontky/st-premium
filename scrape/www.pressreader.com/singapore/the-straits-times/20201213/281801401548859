    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US au­thor­i­ties on Fri­day car­ried out their 10th ex­e­cu­tion of the year, the last in a se­ries of cap­i­tal pun­ish­ments that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has car­ried out be­fore he leaves of­fice.</p>
    <p>Al­fred Bour­geois, a black man sen­tenced to death for the mur­der of his two-year-old daugh­ter, was ex­e­cuted by lethal in­jec­tion at a prison in Terre Haute, In­di­ana.</p>
    <p>“Bour­geois was pro­nounced de­ceased at 8.21pm East­ern Stan­dard Time by the Vigo County Coro­ner,” the fed­eral prison said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The ex­e­cu­tion oc­curred a day af­ter an­other con­victed pris­oner, Bran­don Bernard, was also ex­e­cuted in Terre Haute.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a pa­ter­nity test, Bour­geois, a 55-year-old for­mer truck driver, took tem­po­rary cus­tody of his daugh­ter and brought her on a truck­ing route for part of the sum­mer of 2002.</p>
    <p>He se­verely abused her and even­tu­ally smashed her skull on the wind­shield.</p>
    <p>Since the crime took place on a mil­i­tary base where he was mak­ing a de­liv­ery, he was tried in fed­eral court and sen­tenced to death in 2004.</p>
    <p>He re­mained on death row, with the United States hav­ing sus­pended fed­eral ex­e­cu­tions be­gin­ning in 2003, in par­tic­u­lar be­cause of ques­tions over the le­gal­ity of drugs used in in­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump how­ever restarted fed­eral ex­e­cu­tions in July – even though states still us­ing cap­i­tal pun­ish­ment have de­layed theirs due to the dan­gers posed to prison staff and wit­nesses by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Seven fed­eral ex­e­cu­tions oc­curred be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion that Mr Trump lost to Demo­crat Joe Bi­den, who is due to be sworn in on Jan 20 de­spite the out­go­ing Pres­i­dent’s re­fusal to con­cede.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has pledged to work with Congress to bring an end to fed­eral ex­e­cu­tions.</p>
    <p>For 131 years, out­go­ing pres­i­dents tra­di­tion­ally sus­pended fed­eral ex­e­cu­tions dur­ing the tran­si­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had an­nounced six ex­e­cu­tions be­tween Novem­ber and Jan­uary, in­clud­ing Bour­geois’.</p>
    <p>“The jury that sen­tenced Mr Bour­geois to death never learnt that he was a per­son with in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity be­cause his trial lawyers did not present the ev­i­dence that was avail­able to them,” said his new lawyer Vic­tor Abreu.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the ex­e­cu­tion, his le­gal team is­sued a state­ment say­ing that “tonight, the US killed a man with in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity in spite of clear di­rec­tives from the US Supreme Court and fed­eral laws that pro­hib­ited it”.</p>
