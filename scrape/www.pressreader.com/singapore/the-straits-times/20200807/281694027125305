    <p>SAO PAULO • Five months af­ter con­firm­ing its first case of the coro­n­avirus, Brazil is fast ap­proach­ing the bleak mile­stone of 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, a tragedy that ex­perts blame on the coun­try’s lack of a co­her­ent re­sponse.</p>
    <p>It will be just the sec­ond coun­try to cross that grim thresh­old, af­ter the United States where the death toll is now more than 150,000.</p>
    <p>“It’s a tragedy, one of the worst Brazil has ever seen,” said so­ci­ol­o­gist Celso Rocha de Bar­ros, as the num­ber of in­fec­tions in the sprawl­ing South Amer­i­can coun­try ap­proached three mil­lion – also the sec­ond-high­est in the world, af­ter the US.</p>
    <p>Brazil con­firmed its first case of Covid-19 on Feb 26: a Sao Paulo busi­ness­man who re­turned from a trip to Italy.</p>
    <p>The coun­try of 212 mil­lion peo­ple reg­is­tered its first death on March 16. Dr Paulo Lotufo, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Sao Paulo, said: “At that point, Brazil was more or less get­ting or­gan­ised to deal with the pandemic.”</p>
    <p>But then, po­lit­i­cal chaos en­sued. Far-right Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro con­demned the “hys­te­ria” around the virus and railed against de­ci­sions by state and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to im­pose stay-at-home mea­sures to con­tain it, ar­gu­ing that the eco­nomic dam­age would be worse than the disease.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the coun­try’s in­fec­tion curve ex­ploded. Chill­ing images emerged from Sao Paulo of six-minute speed buri­als by grave dig­gers clad head to toe in pro­tec­tive gear and mass plots ex­ca­vated by bull­doz­ers in the Ama­zon city of Manaus.</p>
    <p>The curve has plateaued in re­cent weeks, but at a high level: Brazil has reg­is­tered an av­er­age of around 1,000 deaths per day for more than a month.</p>
    <p>The toll stood at 2.9 mil­lion in­fec­tions and 97,256 deaths late on</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day. The coun­try ap­peared to be on track to record its 100,000th death this week­end.</p>
    <p>A fer­vent ad­vo­cate of the drug hy­drox­y­chloro­quine to fight against Covid-19 – de­spite a lack of ev­i­dence for its ef­fec­tive­ness – Pres­i­dent Bol­sonaro churned through two health min­is­ters in less than a month, af­ter fall­ing out with them over the re­sponse to the pandemic.</p>
    <p>The post is now held on an in­terim ba­sis by an army gen­eral with no prior med­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, mean­while, has con­tin­ued to down­play the virus, even af­ter catch­ing it him­self last month. He was forced into quar­an­tine for three weeks. “Nearly ev­ery­one here is go­ing to catch it even­tu­ally. What are you afraid of? Face up to it,” he said af­ter emerg­ing from iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage from the Bol­sonaro gov­ern­ment has been “the ex­act op­po­site” of what it should have been, said Mr de Bar­ros. “Lock­down is dif­fi­cult. It has to be co­or­di­nated by a leader with po­lit­i­cal cred­i­bil­ity... You have to ex­plain to peo­ple that it’s hard but nec­es­sary to avoid a mas­sacre.”</p>
