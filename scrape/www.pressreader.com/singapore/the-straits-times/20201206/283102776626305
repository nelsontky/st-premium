    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic is an un­prece­dented global cri­sis that has over­whelmed health­care sys­tems and up­ended busi­nesses around the world.</p>
    <p>While it has rav­aged economies world­wide and con­sumer sen­ti­ment re­mains largely sub­dued, the skies seem brighter for Sin­ga­pore’s prop­erty sec­tor so far. A surge in buy­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and an uptick in sales were ob­served across many hous­ing seg­ments af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But dur­ing the lock­down, flats were shut­tered and home view­ings were banned for two months to pre­vent the spread of the in­fec­tion. As a re­sult, pri­vate home sales dipped by 37.6 per cent from 4,269 units in the first quar­ter to 2,664 units in the se­cond.</p>
    <p>Over­all prices of pri­vate homes slipped 0.7 per cent in the first half of this year. The pub­lic hous­ing mar­ket was not spared ei­ther. Re­sale trans­ac­tions tum­bled by more than 40 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter to 3,426 units in the se­cond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In a sur­pris­ing turn of events, the prop­erty mar­ket roared back to life when view­ings were per­mit­ted again. June’s new home sales surged by more than 100 per cent month on month to their high­est level in seven years.</p>
    <p>PROP­ERTY BOOM IN A PAN­DEMIC</p>
    <p>The pos­i­tive buy­ing mo­men­tum con­tin­ued for an­other four months. In­deed, more than 8,000 new homes were sold in the first 10 months of this year, which is highly en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>In­vestor ex­u­ber­ance in the pri­mary mar­ket spilt over to the sec­ondary mar­ket as 3,467 pri­vate re­sale homes were trans­acted in the third quar­ter. This is a whop­ping 271.6 per cent in­crease from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The HDB seg­ment stunned mar­ket watch­ers as well. Prices of re­sale flats rose 1.5 per cent last quar­ter, af­ter in­creas­ing marginally by 0.3 per cent in the pre­ced­ing quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Sales vol­ume for re­sale flats re­bounded by al­most 25 per cent year on year to 7,787 units in the third quar­ter. Based on HDB data from data.gov.sg, last quar­ter’s sales were the high­est since the third quar­ter of 2010 when 8,205 units were trans­acted.</p>
    <p>IF THE ECON­OMY IS DOWN, WHY IS PROP­ERTY MAR­KET DO­ING WELL?</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is not the only place that has ex­pe­ri­enced a surge in prop­erty sales. Other real es­tate hot spots like New York, Syd­ney, Shang­hai and Seoul have sim­i­larly seen a hike in prop­erty sales in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has caused many buy­ers to re­flect deeply on their long-term in­vest­ment strate­gies. Cur­rency fluc­tu­a­tion and sharp de­clines in global equities have rav­aged the wealth of many peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on cap­i­tal preser­va­tion has driven some in­vestors to di­vert their funds to real es­tate prop­er­ties, which are deemed to be a more sta­ble and di­ver­si­fied source of re­turns dur­ing times of un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Gov­ern­ment has stepped in to help busi­nesses and house­holds cope fi­nan­cially and pre­vent large-scale job losses, by un­veil­ing four stim­u­lus pack­ages to­talling around $100 bil­lion. This is by far the largest res­cue pack­age launched. The stim­u­lus re­leased dur­ing pre­vi­ous down­turns in 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2009 ranged be­tween $230 mil­lion and $20.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures were put i n place to sta­bilise prop­erty prices. For in­stance, el­i­gi­ble bor­row­ers are al­lowed to de­fer loan re­pay­ments while de­vel­op­ers may ap­ply to ex­tend the com­ple­tion pe­riod of devel­op­ments. This has pre­vented sell­ers from panic sell­ing and slash­ing prices too deeply to move sales.</p>
    <p>HAS THE PROP­ERTY MAR­KET PER­FORMED UP TO EX­PEC­TA­TION?</p>
    <p>The prop­erty mar­ket has averted a ma­jor price cor­rec­tion thus far.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, pri­vate home prices rose 0.8 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter in the third quar­ter, af­ter re­bound­ing 0.3 per cent in the se­cond.</p>
    <p>Prices inched up marginally by 0.1 per cent in the first three quar­ters of this year.</p>
    <p>While the price in­crease may be mod­est, it has beaten ex­pec­ta­tions of many an­a­lysts. At the on­set of the pan­demic, a num­ber of an­a­lysts pre­dicted that prices of pri­vate homes could dip by 3 per cent to 8 per cent this year, while a few ex­pected prices to fall by more than 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>For the pub­lic hous­ing seg­ment, the HDB re­sale mar­ket posted a stronger per­for­mance than the pri­vate res­i­den­tial mar­ket. Based on the HDB re­sale in­dex, prices of re­sale flats rose by 1.8 per cent in the first three quar­ters of this year. Last quar­ter’s sales also reached their high­est level in 10 years.</p>
    <p>WHO ARE BUY­ING PROP­ER­TIES DUR­ING THE PAN­DEMIC?</p>
    <p>Due to strict travel re­stric­tions, lo­cals are now dom­i­nat­ing the pri­vate res­i­den­tial mar­ket across all mar­ket seg­ments. About 80 per cent of pri­vate non-landed homes were bought by Sin­ga­pore­ans in the third quar­ter. This is the high­est pro­por­tion recorded since the first quar­ter of 2009.</p>
    <p>Most pri­vate home buy­ers are HDB up­graders, mid­dle-aged in­vestors, fam­i­lies with young chil­dren, young ex­ec­u­tives, re­tirees and a num­ber of for­mer own­ers of homes sold en bloc.</p>
    <p>Some of these own­ers do not mind pay­ing slightly more for an older but larger prop­erty, es­pe­cially if they are buy­ing it for their own oc­cu­pa­tion. This may ex­plain why de­mand for large-sized pri­vate homes has been ris­ing.</p>
    <p>WHAT PROP­ER­TIES ARE PEO­PLE BUY­ING NOW?</p>
    <p>Pri­vate homes in the mass mar­ket and city fringe ar­eas con­tinue to form the bulk of pur­chases this year. These homes are af­ford­able and read­ily avail­able in the mar­ket. For the first 10 months of this year, 45 per cent of pri­vate homes sold were in the mass mar­ket while 37 per cent were in the city fringes.</p>
    <p>The bulk of pri­vate home pur­chases (about 60 per cent) this year are be­low $1.5 mil­lion. How­ever, there seems to be an emerg­ing trend where larger and pricier homes are grow­ing in de­mand.</p>
    <p>Over the past few months, there was a surge in sales of large con­do­minium units and landed prop­er­ties. For in­stance, more than 1,600 large con­do­minium units (1,200 sq ft and above) changed hands last quar­ter. This is 37.7 per cent higher than in the same pe­riod last year and above the last two-year av­er­age of 1,048 units. Around 600 landed prop­er­ties were also trans­acted in the third quar­ter, the strong­est quar­terly landed sales since the se­cond quar­ter of 2018.</p>
    <p>Per­haps a grow­ing num­ber of peo­ple have come to re­alise the need for a larger liv­ing space since many are work­ing from home and the trend may con­tinue post-pan­demic. Some as­tute buy­ers may also feel that large homes could be out of their reach if prices con­tinue to inch up. There­fore, it could make more fi­nan­cial sense to buy a big­ger home now since prices have not peaked.</p>
    <p>Cur­rency fluc­tu­a­tion and sharp de­clines in global equities have rav­aged the wealth of many peo­ple. The fo­cus on cap­i­tal preser­va­tion has driven some in­vestors to di­vert their funds to real es­tate prop­er­ties, which are deemed to be a more sta­ble and di­ver­si­fied source of re­turns dur­ing times of un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS THE OUT­LOOK?</p>
    <p>We re­main op­ti­mistic about the long-term prospects of Sin­ga­pore’s res­i­den­tial mar­ket. The fun­da­men­tals of our coun­try – po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, pro-busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, safe haven sta­tus, ex­cel­lent health­care sys­tem and ro­bust le­gal sys­tem – have re­main un­changed through­out the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer con­fi­dence will con­tinue to pick up as Sin­ga­pore is at the cusp of the third phase of re­open­ing. The in­crease in eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties will help re­vive many busi­nesses next year. The prospects of life re­turn­ing to greater nor­malcy may be less re­mote since many na­tions are al­ready pre­par­ing to roll out largescale vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes next year.</p>
    <p>We an­tic­i­pate that prices of pri­vate homes may rise by around 1 per cent to 3 per cent, while around 8,500 and 9,500 pri­vate homes could be sold next year. For the HDB mar­ket, prices may con­tinue to rise by 2 per cent to 4 per cent, while re­sale vol­ume may in­crease by up to 10 per cent next year.</p>
    <p>There seems to be an emerg­ing trend where larger and pricier homes are grow­ing in de­mand. Over the past few months, there was a surge in sales of large con­do­minium units and landed prop­er­ties.</p>
