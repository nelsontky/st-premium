    <p>It took years for a physi­cian’s in­sight into hand-wash­ing to be­come com­mon in­fec­tion con­trol prac­tice. But to­day, in the anx­i­ety over Covid-19 treat­ments, we may be rush­ing into im­pa­tient ac­cep­tance, says Pro­fes­sor Chong Siow Ann (be­low).</p>
    <p>On March 20, as mil­lions of peo­ple around the world turned to the homepage of Google, they would have seen the car­toon of a bald-headed mus­ta­chioed man in a bow tie; the cheer­ful doo­dle be­lied the real-life tragedy of this Hun­gar­ian physi­cian named Ig­naz Sem­mel­weis.</p>
    <p>Born in 1818, Dr Sem­mel­weis stud­ied and prac­tised ob­stet­rics in the ma­ter­nity clinic at Vi­enna Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal af­ter grad­u­at­ing from med­i­cal school. The turn­ing point in his life came when he was struck by the high death rate in a ma­ter­nity ward that was staffed by physi­cians and med­i­cal stu­dents: 13 per cent to 18 per cent of new moth­ers were dy­ing of childbed fever, also known as puer­peral fever. This was in stark con­trast to a ward that was run by mid­wives where only about 2 per cent of women died of the same con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Sem­mel­weis delved into it with­out mak­ing much head­way un­til the death of a se­nior col­league, Pro­fes­sor Jakob Kol­letschka, from an over­whelm­ing in­fec­tion af­ter he ac­ci­den­tally cut him­self with a scalpel used in an au­topsy of one of the women.</p>
    <p>In an ac­count pub­lished many years later, Dr Sem­mel­weis wrote: “To­tally shat­tered, I brooded over the case with in­tense emo­tion, un­til it crosses my mind... that childbed fever and the death of Pro­fes­sor Kol­letschka were one and the same... The fact of the mat­ter was that the trans­mit­ting source of the ca­daver par­ti­cles was to be found in the hands of the stu­dents and at­tend­ing physi­cians.”</p>
    <p>The physi­cians, Dr Sem­mel­weis re­alised, were un­like the mid­wives be­cause they car­ried out post-mortems on women who died of child­hood fever. Dr Sem­mel­weis be­lieved his fel­low physi­cians were car­ry­ing in­vis­i­ble “ca­daver par­ti­cles” on their hands from the corpses they had dis­sected, and these same un­washed hands were de­liv­er­ing ba­bies in the ward. He did an ex­per­i­ment: He made any­one ex­am­in­ing a wo­man in that ward wash their hands in a chlo­ri­nated lime so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Within months, the dra­matic re­sults of this sim­ple change were ap­par­ent: The ma­ter­nal mor­tal­ity rate dropped to 1 per cent to 2 per cent, match­ing that of the mid­wives’ ward.</p>
    <p>Dr Sem­mel­weis’ mo­men­tous dis­cov­ery was an idea be­fore its time. Dis­eases then were thought to spread by some toxic mi­asma drift­ing through the air. Dr Sem­mel­weis was claim­ing some­thing rad­i­cal – that some in­vis­i­ble par­ti­cles on doc­tors’ hands were to blame – which did not go down well with his fel­low doc­tors and many re­sisted his the­ory.</p>
    <p>Dr Sem­mel­weis, who did not speak Ger­man well, largely shied away from speak­ing about his find­ings at med­i­cal con­fer­ences, and as he did not pub­lish the de­tails of his ob­ser­va­tions and con­clu­sions in med­i­cal jour­nals, only those who had seen the re­sults of his hand-wash­ing ex­per­i­ments first-hand had good rea­sons to ac­cept them.</p>
    <p>When he did fi­nally pub­lish his find­ings some 17 years later, it was in the form of a ram­bling book that was roundly crit­i­cised as un­fo­cused and lack­ing in rig­or­ous sci­en­tific rea­son­ing. Un­able to con­tain his bit­ter­ness, Dr Sem­mel­weis in­serted salvoes of abuses at his de­trac­tors within the pages and ac­cused them of mur­der­ing moth­ers. The re­sponse of the med­i­cal com­mu­nity was ei­ther to at­tack it or – just as damn­ing – to ig­nore it.</p>
    <p>At the age of 47, he suf­fered a men­tal breakdown and was ad­mit­ted to an asy­lum. Two weeks later, he was dead. It was thought that he died from sep­sis af­ter a wound on his hand be­came in­fected.</p>
    <p>It was only much later af­ter his death that he was both li­onised as “the fa­ther of in­fec­tion con­trol” who rev­o­lu­tionised medicine with that sin­gu­lar act of hand-wash­ing, and mythol­o­gised as an ar­che­typal tragic Greek hero over­whelmed and de­stroyed by forces be­yond his con­trol.</p>
    <p>But in many ways, this hero had brought it upon him­self. Among the var­i­ous salu­tary lessons that his life has for us is the im­por­tance of be­ing able to ef­fec­tively communicat­e sci­en­tific find­ings and their im­pli­ca­tions – some­thing that, now more than ever in this time of the coron­avirus and the ex­is­ten­tial threat it car­ries, de­mands our at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>BAD AND GOOD SCI­ENCE</p>
    <p>As chance would have it, on the very same day that Google hon­oured Dr Sem­mel­weis on its homepage, a pa­per ap­peared in the In­ter­na­tional Journal of An­timi­cro­bial Agents that re­ported the find­ings of a trial con­ducted in a re­search cen­tre in Mar­seille of the drug hy­drox­y­chloro­quine (an anti-malar­ial drug) among pa­tients with Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump touted hy­drox­y­chloro­quine as a “game changer” in a press con­fer­ence. “It can help them, but it’s not go­ing to hurt them,” he said. “That’s the beauty of it.”</p>
    <p>It prompted an al­most im­me­di­ate cau­tion by Dr An­thony Fauci, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, that the ev­i­dence for its ef­fi­cacy is “anec­do­tal” and “not done in a con­trolled clin­i­cal trial”. (Pres­i­dent Trump had since gone on to say that he has been tak­ing this drug as a preven­tive mea­sure.)</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s en­thu­si­asm for the drug ap­peared to be largely based on that French study, which he ap­par­ently learnt of from Twit­ter. This small study, which was led by a mav­er­ick re­searcher, in­volved just 26 pa­tients who re­ceived a com­bi­na­tion of hy­drox­y­chloro­quine and an an­tibi­otic called azithromyc­in. In the fi­nal analysis, six pa­tients were ex­cluded, of whom three were trans­ferred to in­ten­sive care and one died sub­se­quently.</p>
    <p>Of the re­main­ing 20 with mild symp­toms, it was likely that they would al­most cer­tainly have sur­vived on their own, with or with­out tak­ing these drugs. It was a hastily done study rid­dled with many method­olog­i­cal flaws and much crit­i­cised by ex­perts in the field, one of whom wryly com­mented: “My re­sults always look amaz­ing if I leave out the pa­tients who died.”</p>
    <p>The gold stan­dard to test the ef­fi­cacy of hy­drox­y­chloro­quine is a large well-con­trolled ran­domised, dou­ble-blind clin­i­cal trial that would com­pare it with a placebo (an in­ert fake medicine that looks ex­actly like the test drug).</p>
    <p>There must be enough pa­tients who con­sent to par­tic­i­pate in this trial and who would be ran­domly as­signed to take ei­ther hy­drox­y­chloro­quine or the placebo. The pa­tients and the re­searchers who as­sess them are “blinded” – that is, they do not know who is get­ting the ac­tual drug and who is get­ting the placebo. The re­sults based on clearly de­fined out­come mea­sures are then com­pared us­ing the ap­pro­pri­ate sta­tis­ti­cal meth­ods to as­cer­tain whether the ef­fects of hy­drox­y­chloro­quine are sig­nif­i­cantly and clin­i­cally bet­ter than the placebo, and not sim­ply due to chance and the noise of hu­man vari­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The find­ings would be writ­ten up and sub­mit­ted to a journal, where they would be re­viewed by other ex­perts to as­sess whether the meth­ods, analysis and con­clu­sions are sound. This process, which would in­vari­ably in­clude fur­ther clar­i­fi­ca­tions by the authors in re­sponse to the com­ments of the re­view­ers, is known as peer re­view, and is the main mech­a­nism by which sci­en­tific jour­nals serve as the gate­keep­ers be­tween re­searchers and the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>Jour­nals gen­er­ally take many months, even up to a year, to re­view and edit a com­pli­cated study. Once pub­lished, the pa­per will come un­der the scru­tiny of the wider sci­en­tific com­mu­nity, and other re­searchers would carry out fur­ther ex­per­i­ments to sup­port or dis­prove the find­ings – which ex­plains why some say one of sci­ence’s old­est pas­times is to call out the er­rors of other sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>So, good sci­ence takes time with this cy­cle of well-de­signed and scrupu­lously con­ducted stud­ies, rig­or­ous peer re­views, and repli­ca­tions with fur­ther stud­ies. But in this des­per­ate time amid so much suf­fer­ing and dy­ing, this cau­tion and care can seem more like un­nec­es­sary dawdling and im­ped­i­ments than es­sen­tial sci­en­tific im­per­a­tives.</p>
    <p>SEM­MEL­WEIS REFLEX</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tific com­mu­nity has re­sponded to this sense of ur­gency and fast-tracked the sci­en­tific process for Covid-19 re­search so much so that ev­ery­thing has be­come a race.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing is sped up: the ap­proval of pro­to­cols by ethics boards, the pace that re­searchers are driv­ing them­selves to fin­ish their stud­ies, and the rate that aca­demic and med­i­cal jour­nals are pub­lish­ing these find­ings.</p>
    <p>This des­per­ate ea­ger­ness to em­brace any­thing that prom­ises to soften or take away the ter­ror and suf­fer­ing has its in­evitable risks.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter Pres­i­dent Trump’s en­dorse­ment of hy­drox­y­chloro­quine, the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (or FDA, the agency in Amer­ica that is re­spon­si­ble for pro­tect­ing pub­lic health by as­sur­ing the safety and ef­fi­cacy of drugs and other prod­ucts – the equiv­a­lent of our Health Sciences Au­thor­ity) is­sued an Emer­gency Use Au­tho­ri­sa­tion for its use in ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 treat­ment. This de­ci­sion by the</p>
    <p>FDA was out of char­ac­ter, hav­ing been made with very scant ev­i­dence, and came un­der fire from sci­en­tists and physi­cians.</p>
    <p>There were con­cerns that the in­dis­crim­i­nate use of hy­drox­y­chloro­quine could po­ten­tially add to the death toll from Covid-19 in­fec­tion be­cause of its se­ri­ous pos­si­ble side ef­fects – such as liver and kid­ney dam­age, heart fail­ure and car­diac ar­rest.</p>
    <p>And these fears were not un­war­ranted: A man in Ari­zona died (and his wife landed in in­ten­sive care) af­ter self-med­i­cat­ing them­selves with chloro­quine phos­phate, which was in a for­mu­la­tion sold to clean fish tanks. Sim­i­lar poi­son­ings have been re­ported else­where in the world.</p>
    <p>It did not stop Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro (an ad­mirer of Pres­i­dent Trump) from push­ing his coun­try’s Health Min­istry to rec­om­mend us­ing hy­drox­y­chloro­quine to treat even mild cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There is a term called the Sem­mel­weis reflex, which refers to that very hu­man ten­dency to cling to pre-ex­ist­ing be­liefs and to re­ject fresh ideas that con­tra­dict them de­spite ad­e­quate ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>It is less likely that this will be the case at this time; in fact, the dan­ger is quite the op­po­site. With our in­tense de­sire for an an­ti­dote that prom­ises to re­turn us back to the life we had be­fore this pan­demic, we might be just too im­pa­tient, to our own detri­ment.</p>
