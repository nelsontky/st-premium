    <p>PG, 106 min­utes, opens to­mor­row</p>
    <p>The best Pixar movies are not afraid to go to places other an­i­ma­tion films dare not.</p>
    <p>Be­cause a big part of Soul is set in the af­ter­life, it – at first glance – ap­pears to be about shuf­fling off the mor­tal coil.</p>
    <p>Not quite. While it deals with grown-up top­ics such as the mean­ing of life, it tip­toes around the idea of mor­tal­ity, choos­ing in­stead to put for­ward a candy-coloured cos­mol­ogy that of­ten suf­fo­cates its deeper ques­tions un­der lay­ers of whimsy.</p>
    <p>Joe Gard­ner, voiced by Jamie Foxx, is a mu­sic teacher who yearns to play pro­fes­sion­ally with a jazz out­fit. His life is cut short as he is on the verge of achiev­ing his goal.</p>
    <p>Un­will­ing to go peace­fully to his eter­nal rest, he fi­na­gles his way to an­other di­men­sion in which freshly minted souls are pre­pared for life on Earth.</p>
    <p>He meets 22, voiced by Tina Fey, a trou­ble­maker who has sab­o­taged ev­ery at­tempt at be­ing born into a hu­man body.</p>
    <p>You will not be sur­prised to learn that di­rec­tor and co-writer Pete Doc­ter worked on In­side Out (2015) – a film that, like Soul, turns ab­stract con­cepts into char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Here, as in the pre­vi­ous film, the “adora­bil­ity” fac­tor is high, helped along by voice-act­ing tal­ent such as Bri­tish ac­tor Richard Ayoade, who plays a be­fore-life coun­sel­lor with the bouncy good cheer of a chil­dren’s tele­vi­sion-show host. Coun­sel­lors like him in­habit a weird yet fully formed world. Cre­at­ing a uni­verse from scratch has al­ways been a Pixar strength.</p>
    <p>In­side Out told movie­go­ers it is okay to be sad and the Toy Story films (1995 to 2019) showed peo­ple what they lose when they grow up. Soul’s cen­tral idea re­mains vague un­til its fi­nal mo­ments, when it is stated qui­etly, al­most re­luc­tantly. Is this Doc­ter and team los­ing the plot or is it Pixar be­ing sub­tle?</p>
    <p>Here is where the film dis­ap­points. Fey’s snarky 22 and Foxx’s earnest Joe, the story’s un­likely buddies, are meant to of­fer the usual “loathe, laugh and learn” dra­matic pair­ing.</p>
    <p>Fey has a great time be­ing a sassy child and that joy is in­fec­tious so, as a comedic de­vice, it works. But her pres­ence also feels like a cyn­i­cal move, a way of in­ject­ing vanilla into a dish some may find too “eth­nic”.</p>
    <p>Joe’s story, set in New York’s black neigh­bour­hoods, is rich in vis­ual and cul­tural de­tail. One won­ders how much richer his story, and how much more poignant its res­o­lu­tion, could have been – if not for the time taken by the wise­crack­ing kid.</p>
    <p>SHOCK WAVE 2</p>
    <p>NC16, 120 min­utes, opens to­day</p>
    <p>The fol­low-up to the 2017 bomb-plot thriller fea­tures the same star and di­rec­tor – Andy Lau and Her­man Yau re­spec­tively – in a new and un­re­lated story.</p>
    <p>This is typ­i­cal of Hong Kong fran­chise movies. Com­pare this ap­proach with what Hol­ly­wood does, which is to rewrite his­tory so that char­ac­ters ap­par­ently killed in the pre­vi­ous film spring con­ve­niently back to life, and one can see the mer­its of the Asian style.</p>
    <p>Lau is back as yet an­other bomb-dis­posal of­fi­cer. This time, he is Poon, a man will­ing to give his life for his col­leagues and the pub­lic. He al­most does die when a job goes wrong.</p>
    <p>Months later, af­ter a string of ter­ror­ist-planted bombs goes off, the fin­ger of sus­pi­cion is pointed at him, test­ing the loy­al­ties of friends and fel­low of­fi­cers such as Tung (Sean Lau) and Pong (Ni Ni).</p>
    <p>Yau and screen­writer Erica Lee have shoe­horned ev­ery­thing in here – not just from other bomb-squad films, but also from en­tirely dif­fer­ent gen­res. If some works can be called bou­tique pic­tures, this one is a mall.</p>
    <p>Se­quel gi­gan­tism – a sick­ness seen in ac­tion movies based on hits – is at fault, but there are also threads that feel su­per­flu­ous.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, there is a longish mon­tage fea­tur­ing an in­jured Poon get­ting into shape, pre­sum­ably to show off the mid­dle-aged Lau’s hunk fac­tor.</p>
    <p>The film also opens with a mas­sive, megadeath-scale ex­plo­sion – we are talk­ing nu­clear event here – fol­lowed by a voice-over say­ing that a blast like this is a pos­si­bil­ity un­less good peo­ple do their jobs.</p>
    <p>For those who recog­nise land­marks, the sight of the mush­room-topped fury sweep­ing away Hong Kong In­ter­na­tional Air­port and the sur­round­ing land­scape car­ries the same thrill as watch­ing Ma­rina Bay Sands dis­in­te­grate in alien-at­tack movie In­de­pen­dence Day: Resur­gence (2016). It’s an insider ref­er­ence that works, in spite of how much of a sto­ry­telling dodge it is.</p>
    <p>But you do not watch a Her­man Yau movie for min­i­mal­ism.</p>
    <p>You watch one be­cause it of­fers value for money.</p>
    <p>He has one prob­lem, though: In ac­cor­dance with me­dia rules in China, po­lice char­ac­ters have to be liv­ing saints.</p>
    <p>Yau checks this box with the en­thu­si­asm of a civil ser­vant long­ing for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>MON­STER HUNTER</p>
    <p>PG13, 104 min­utes, opens to­day</p>
    <p>Not re­viewed</p>
    <p>Based on the video game of the same name, this science-fic­tion thriller stars Milla Jovovich as the leader of an elite squad who is sent through a por­tal into a world teem­ing with deadly crea­tures, and Tony Jaa as a na­tive who helps her team sur­vive.</p>
