    <p>More peo­ple will be able to at­tend wed­ding cer­e­monies and re­cep­tions from Oct 3, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Up to 100 peo­ple, in­clud­ing the wed­ding cou­ple but ex­clud­ing ven­dors and ser­vice providers, will be al­lowed to at­tend wed­ding re­cep­tions in venues that are per­mit­ted to serve food and drinks, Mr Gan said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>This is up from the cur­rent limit of 50 un­der a pi­lot scheme.</p>
    <p>The cap for mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions will also be dou­bled to 100 peo­ple, split across mul­ti­ple zones of up to 50 peo­ple each, he added.</p>
    <p>But the cap for solem­ni­sa­tions held in homes and the Reg­istries of Civil and Mus­lim Mar­riages build­ing re­mains un­changed at 10 peo­ple, ex­clud­ing the solem­niser, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said in a press state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan noted that some cou­ples have put off their wed­ding plans in the hope of rid­ing out the pan­demic and pro­ceed­ing with their orig­i­nal plans for a large wed­ding re­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>“But the end of the pan­demic is still some way off and in­def­i­nitely post­pon­ing a wed­ding may not be prac­ti­cal or de­sir­able,” said Mr Gan, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The MOH added that the re­lax­ation of rules is aimed at fa­cil­i­tat­ing mar­riages that may have been post­poned or put on hold.</p>
    <p>“Given the dy­namic (na­ture) of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, we en­cour­age cou­ples who are ready to pro­ceed with their wed­ding plans to do so with­out de­lay,” it said.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants in a wed­ding can be split into mul­ti­ple zones of up to 50 peo­ple each, or split by stag­gered tim­ings, with up to 50 peo­ple in each time slot, said the MOH.</p>

At least 30 min­utes should be al­lo­cated be­tween the time slots for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion of the event space, MOH added.</p>

    <p>Venue op­er­a­tors may im­pose a lower cap if they are un­able to com­ply with the zon­ing or stag­gered tim­ing re­quire­ments, and vide­olink solem­ni­sa­tions will con­tinue to be of­fered as an op­tion for cou­ples.</p>
    <p>From Novem­ber, a new pi­lot that will al­low wed­ding re­cep­tions ar­ranged by a reg­is­tered wed­ding or­gan­iser at Hous­ing Board com­mon ar­eas, such as void decks and mul­tipur­pose halls man­aged by town coun­cils, will also be launched, said Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther de­tails, i nclud­ing the start date for this ini­tia­tive, will be re­leased at a later stage, said MOH.</p>
    <p>There were 13,626 cou­ples who solem­nised their mar­riages from Jan­uary to July last year.</p>
    <p>That num­ber fell 23 per cent to 10,542 dur­ing the same pe­riod this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun Xuel­ing, Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment and for Ed­u­ca­tion, said in Par­lia­ment ear­lier this month that the fall in the num­ber of nup­tials this year will have a neg­a­tive im­pact on the num­ber of new­borns in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>She wrote on Face­book yes­ter­day: “2020 may be a chal­leng­ing year, but we hope cou­ples will pro­ceed with their mar­riage plans! Best wishes!”</p>
