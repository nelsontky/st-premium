    <p>Cel­e­brate the spirit of giv­ing by par­tic­i­pat­ing in SG Cares Giv­ing Week and dis­cover how you can sup­port our lo­cal char­i­ties</p>
    <p>2020 may not have been a great year, but we can still end it on a good note and have The Best Week Ever — by opt­ing to share our time, tal­ent, trea­sure or voice to cre­ate a pos­i­tive im­pact in the community.</p>
    <p>Hard hit by de­clin­ing do­na­tions in this bat­tered econ­omy, lo­cal char­i­ties are strug­gling with un­prece­dented hard­ships caused by the sus­pen­sion of fundrais­ing events, as well as the tight­en­ing of purse strings by Sin­ga­pore­ans af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But any­one can give — through ac­tiv­i­ties as sim­ple as din­ing or shop­ping un­der this year’s SG Cares Giv­ing Week. This is the giv­ing week’s sixth edi­tion, but for the first time this year, it is jointly or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Vol­un­teer and Phi­lan­thropy Cen­tre (NVPC) in part­ner­ship with SG Cares and the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vices (NCSS) and re­branded as SG Cares Giv­ing Week.</p>
    <p>The giv­ing week runs an­nu­ally from Dec 1 to 7, and this year’s is themed “The Best Week Ever!”. It aims to in­spire the pub­lic to make giv­ing a part of our lives. Here are some ways you can give.</p>
    <p>Give your time or tal­ent through vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties</p>
    <p>A need to be phys­i­cally dis­tanced doesn’t mean the giv­ing has to stop. Check out NVPC’s first-ever vir­tual Giv­ing Hub, which show­cases on­line events and ac­tiv­i­ties that sup­port non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions and char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Got a bud­ding young chef at home?</p>
    <p>Join this free fam­ily cook-off chal­lenge and show off your culi­nary skills via Zoom on Dec 20. This is or­gan­ised by Playeum, a</p>
    <p>char­ity that pro­vides chil­dren an out­let to play, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Kitchen Move­ments.</p>
    <p>You can also stop by the Giv­ing</p>
    <p>Hub for a daily dose of hi­lar­ity and in­spi­ra­tion with Dream Academy from Dec 2 to 6 at 8 pm. Hosted by Suhaimi Yu­sof, with daily spe­cial ap­pear­ances by the Dim Sum Dol­lies, Ku­mar, Se­bas­tian Tan and more, the seg­ment is rais­ing funds for the SG Cares Giv­ing Week Fund in sup­port of smaller char­i­ties which are most af­fected by this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Got “trea­sure” to spare?</p>
    <p>Con­sider do­nat­ing to a good cause</p>
    <p>You can help even while go­ing about your daily life. Un­der its Ev­ery­day Giv­ing ini­tia­tives, NVPC has col­lab­o­rated with giv­ing part­ners, rang­ing from din­ing and re­tail es­tab­lish­ments to cor­po­rate or­gan­i­sa­tions, with giv­ing ini­tia­tives you can take part in.</p>
    <p>Food­ies, for ex­am­ple, can visit F&B part­ners un­der the Dine & Be Kind cam­paign by Food Bank Sin­ga­pore and help raise funds for food bun­dles for low-in­come house­holds. Ms Jessie Tan, the char­ity’s se­nior man­age­ment as­so­ciate, says: “Our F&B part­ners will be pledg­ing pro­ceeds from ev­ery sale or trans­ac­tion of their fes­tive menu. With the pro­ceeds, we are tar­get­ing to pack and dis­trib­ute 5,000 Jolly Kits to low-in­come fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, you can gear up for the fes­tive sea­son by pur­chas­ing a gift from Ama­zon Sin­ga­pore to ful­fil the wishes of any of its part­ner­ing char­i­ties, or shop for mer­chan­dise from non-prof­its listed on e-com­merce plat­forms such as Lazada and Carousell.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery act of kind­ness counts, and a di­rect do­na­tion — big or small — will go a long way in sup­port­ing these char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Giv­ing Trees ini­tia­tive, there are 13 causes un­der three pil­lars — Peo­ple, Na­ture and Pas­sion — you can sup­port, such as the el­derly and the dis­abled (Peo­ple); an­i­mal wel­fare and the en­vi­ron­ment (Na­ture); and the arts and ed­u­ca­tion (Pas­sion).</p>
    <p>This year, the SG Cares Giv­ing Week Fund has also been set up in sup­port of at least 30 smaller char­i­ties with an­nual re­ceipts of less than S$500,000. Pro­ceeds from the var­i­ous SG Cares Giv­ing Week ac­tiv­i­ties and ini­tia­tives from Dec 1 to 31 will go to­wards the fund, where it will be equally dis­bursed among the char­i­ties at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Lend your voice and take to so­cial me­dia for good</p>
    <p>Sup­port your favourite cause by join­ing the #MyHeartBea­t­sFor So­cial Me­dia Chal­lenge. Take a photo of your cause, in­clude any­thing that’s heart-shaped, and share it on Face­book or In­sta­gram. Tag @Giv­ingWeekSG and hash­tag #MyHeartBea­t­sFor and #Giv­ingWeekSG, then tag three friends to spread the word. The three most cre­ative posts will win a sur­prise gift from NVPC.</p>
    <p>You can also share up­lift­ing Giv­ing Sto­ries about car­ing acts on Face­book or In­sta­gram. Sim­ply hash­tag #TheGiv­ingS­to­ries and #Giv­ingWeekSG, and don’t for­get to tag @Giv­ingWeekSG from now till Dec 31.</p>
