    <p>WILM­ING­TON (Delaware) US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den said Fri­day’s grim em­ploy­ment re­port shows the eco­nomic re­cov­ery is stalling and warned the “dark win­ter” ahead would ex­ac­er­bate the pain un­less Congress passes a coro­n­avirus re­lief Bill im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion re­quires ur­gent ac­tion,” Mr Bi­den said in a state­ment. “Amer­i­cans need help and they need it now.”</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment re­port ear­lier showed the labour mar­ket slow­ing last month amid a surge of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, the Demo­cratic for­mer vice-pres­i­dent, has of­fered sup­port for an emerg­ing bi­par­ti­san pack­age of around US$908 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) that has drawn ten­ta­tive back­ing from mem­bers of both par­ties in Congress.</p>
    <p>But he said the Bill would be just the start, and vowed to press for ad­di­tional re­lief once he takes of­fice next month.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect has fo­cused heav­ily on the pan­demic and econ­omy dur­ing the tran­si­tion, af­ter a cam­paign in which he made Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s mis­han­dling of the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion a cen­tral theme.</p>
    <p>He is ex­pected to name Mr Jeff Zients, a co-chair of his tran­si­tion team and a for­mer Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion eco­nomic aide, as his coro­n­avirus “czar” to co­or­di­nate the gov­ern­ment’s pan­demic re­sponse and over­see an am­bi­tious vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion ef­fort, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den last week un­veiled his eco­nomic team, led by his nom­i­nee for Trea­sury sec­re­tary, for­mer Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Janet Yellen.</p>
    <p>But he faces in­ten­si­fy­ing pres­sure from con­gres­sional al­lies and rights groups to make eth­ni­cally di­verse picks for the re­main­ing slots in his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>He is set to meet the board of the</p>
    <p>Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion for the Ad­vance­ment of Coloured Peo­ple, a long-run­ning black civil rights or­gan­i­sa­tion, on Tues­day to dis­cuss crit­i­cisms that his Cab­i­net picks lacked the representa­tion he promised dur­ing a cam­paign that was pro­pelled by black vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The League of United Latin Amer­i­can Ci­ti­zens, an­other prom­i­nent civil rights group, re­leased a state­ment on Fri­day urg­ing “Pres­i­dent Bi­den and his tran­si­tion team to take a fresh, close-up look at the vot­ing clout of Lati­nos across Amer­ica” and en­sure his top ad­vis­ers re­flect the na­tion’s di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the Con­gres­sional His­panic Cau­cus last Thurs­day pub­licly and pri­vately lob­bied for Mr Bi­den to name more Latino mem­bers to his top posts, stew­ing over re­ports that his team had side­lined Gov­er­nor Michelle Lu­jan Gr­isham – who is of Mex­i­can-Amer­i­can de­scent – for a po­si­tion atop the Health and Hu­man Ser­vices depart­ment af­ter she turned down the job of In­te­rior sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s picks for top roles have in­cluded some ground-break­ing picks, in­clud­ing Dr Yellen, who would be the first fe­male Trea­sury sec­re­tary; Ms Neera Tan­den, who would be the first woman of colour to run the Of­fice of Man­age­ment and Bud­get; and Dr Ce­cilia Rouse, who would be the first black woman to over­see the Coun­cil of Eco­nomic Ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>Tran­si­tion spokesman Jen Psaki told re­porters on Fri­day that Mr Bi­den would an­nounce more po­si­tions early this week, in­clud­ing mem­bers of his pub­lic health team.</p>
    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den... has of­fered sup­port for an emerg­ing bi­par­ti­san pack­age of around US$908 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) that has drawn ten­ta­tive back­ing from mem­bers of both par­ties in Congress.</p>
