    <p>As the dark shadow of Covid-19 stalked homes, of­fices, schools and cafes in Asia, a group of su­per­heroes emerged in white lab coats, pow­ered by sci­ence and wield­ing sy­ringes. Col­lec­tively, they are Asia’s virus busters.</p>
    <p>In a feat that has no par­al­lel in med­i­cal his­tory, vac­cines were de­vel­oped, tested and even ad­min­is­tered within months of the coro­n­avirus out­break in late 2019. Ar­riv­ing with a ban­ner of prom­ise not yet un­furled by drugs and other treat­ments, the vac­cines are to­day the start­ing point in the tra­jec­tory from de­spair to hope.</p>
    <p>On Jan 3, a sleep­less team led by Pro­fes­sor Zhang Yongzhen, 55, worked through two nights to se­quence the first com­plete genome of the virus at the Shang­hai Pub­lic Health Clin­i­cal Cen­tre which they shared with the world, open­ing the door to vac­cine de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>China’s ear­li­est vac­cine en­tered clin­i­cal tri­als two months later, led by Ma­jor-Gen­eral Chen Wei, 54, and her team at the PLA Academy of Mil­i­tary Sciences.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, Dr Ryuichi Morishita, 58, of Osaka Univer­sity, and in Sin­ga­pore, Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, 53, of the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, sur­mounted the ini­tial hur­dles and are test­ing their vac­cines on vol­un­teers. Theirs are among the around 50 vac­cines in clin­i­cal tri­als world­wide.</p>
    <p>But cre­at­ing vac­cines at warp speed is only the start of a very long jour­ney. Af­ter mir­a­cles in petri dishes, the next act calls for hero­ism from man­u­fac­tur­ers and busi­ness­men. Bil­lions of doses need to be pro­duced in pris­tine fac­to­ries, at a scale and speed never at­tempted, chal­leng­ing even Asia’s cel­e­brated man­u­fac­tur­ing prow­ess. Time is tick­ing away and win­ter is clos­ing in. The virus at­tacks in waves that can­not be fore­told, and no one is safe un­til ev­ery­one is.</p>
    <p>Celltrion chair­man Seo Jung-jin, 63, who once bor­rowed from loan sharks to fund his start-up, is go­ing flat out at what is now one of South Korea’s largest phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies. He aims to de­liver an an­ti­body treat­ment that will com­ple­ment vac­cines and be avail­able to two mil­lion pa­tients an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Adar Poon­awalla, 39, at the helm of the world’s largest vac­cine pro­ducer, the Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia, has com­mit­ted to pro­duc­ing 200 mil­lion doses for low- and mid­dle-in­come na­tions in Asia and Africa. Mr Seo and Mr Poon­awalla have an­swered the call, joined by many others, to in­oc­u­late Asia’s 4.6 bil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has brought death and hard­ship to the world’s largest and most pop­u­lous con­ti­nent, is meet­ing its tamer in the virus busters.</p>
    <p>But the search con­tin­ues for the one vac­cine that pro­vides them all: im­mu­nity that lasts years, not months, safety from side ef­fects, porta­bil­ity from shore to shore and avail­abil­ity to the poor­est cit­i­zen.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times Asian of the Year award hon­ours a per­son, group of peo­ple or an in­sti­tu­tion that has made the news and con­trib­uted sig­nif­i­cantly to their so­ci­ety, coun­try or the wider Asian con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>In recog­nis­ing the Asian virus busters for the ninth ST Asians of the Year award, we salute your courage, care, com­mit­ment and cre­ativ­ity. In this peril-filled hour, you are a sym­bol of hope for Asia, in­deed the world.</p>
