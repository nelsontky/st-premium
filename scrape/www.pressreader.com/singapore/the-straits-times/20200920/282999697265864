    <p>In a sea­son that has seen fast-mov­ing fires lay waste to mil­lions of acres along the West Coast of the US, per­haps no town has seen the de­struc­tive fury that lev­elled parts of Phoenix, Ore­gon.</p>
    <p>In the span of just a few hours on Sept 8, the Almeda Fire burned through large parts of not only Phoenix but also the neigh­bour­ing town of Tal­ent, to­gether home to 11,000 peo­ple. Lo­cal of­fi­cials es­ti­mated that the fire de­stroyed nearly 1,800 homes and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The ruin was so widespread that a week later, the au­thor­i­ties still would not al­low residents to re­turn home to see what was left. For days, many of the dis­placed were forced to scru­ti­nise bits of aerial footage for clues, while oth­ers hiked for miles to get around road­blocks.</p>
    <p>Four days af­ter the fire, I stood in a Home De­pot park­ing lot on the out­skirts of town, try­ing to find a way in. The Na­tional Guard had blocked the main en­try points, and po­lice were pa­trolling the streets for peo­ple who had sneaked in, wor­ried about the dan­ger of downed power lines and sink­holes. I was be­gin­ning to think I would be un­able to see the dev­as­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>And then a yel­low school bus pulled up.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the wheel was a burly grand­fa­ther in sun­glasses and an or­ange re­flec­tive vest. He in­tro­duced himself as Lee Gre­gory, 63, a lo­cal pas­tor and school-bus driver orig­i­nally from, of all places, Par­adise, the site of Cal­i­for­nia’s dead­li­est fire. Af­ter cre­at­ing a char­ity for his home­town when it burned in 2018, he now faced dis­as­ter in his new home. Within a day, he restarted the char­ity and threw himself into an­other re­lief ef­fort.</p>
    <p>“If you want to take a bus ride, you’re in­vited,” he said.</p>
    <p>I told him thanks, but I was fo­cused on get­ting into Phoenix.</p>
    <p>“I can take you there,” he replied. “No one else can.”</p>
    <p>A ROAD THROUGH THE WRECK­AGE</p>
    <p>We rum­bled down High­way 99, the main thor­ough­fare in Phoenix and Tal­ent that had now be­come a path through the wreck­age.</p>
    <p>There was an­other pas­sen­ger: Stuart War­ren, a 35-year-old Phoenix coun­cil­man. Mr Gre­gory had picked him up two days ear­lier, in the same Home De­pot park­ing lot, when Mr War­ren was look­ing for ways to help con­stituents. The duo had since been car­ry­ing per­ish­able food from pow­er­less su­per­mar­kets and dis­placed fam­i­lies to evac­u­a­tion shel­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr War­ren didn’t seem like your av­er­age politi­cian. He was a bearded fly-fish­ing guide with a duck-call ring­tone who had moved to Phoenix from nearby Ash­land in 2015. It was the only place where he could af­ford to buy a home near where he wanted to fish. Shortly af­ter he ar­rived, he ran for of­fice, hop­ing to do what he could at the lo­cal level about cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“I recog­nised the need for there to be new faces,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yet, he ad­mit­ted, his sit­u­a­tion was not as pre­car­i­ous as that of many of his neigh­bours in Phoenix.</p>
    <p>For decades, the town has been a haven for peo­ple who can­not af­ford the ris­ing prices in Med­ford and Ash­land, of­fer­ing cheap hous­ing, an idyl­lic Pa­cific North-west set­ting and access to med­i­cal care and jobs min­utes up the free­way. That mix has at­tracted re­tirees on fixed in­comes and farm work­ers who pick the sweet Comice pears from nearby orchards that end up in Harry & David gift bas­kets shipped around the world.</p>
    <p>The Almeda Fire dis­pro­por­tion­ately hit those residents, wip­ing out about a dozen tightly packed mo­bile-home parks. Lo­cal of­fi­cials and residents said that many home­own­ers in those parks lacked in­surance, in part be­cause fire did not seem to be a threat; they could hear In­ter­state 5 from their bed­rooms. And none of them owned even a slice of land; they rented the small plots where their homes once sat.</p>
    <p>With such a fi­nan­cial blow, many of those peo­ple will strug­gle to re­turn, and some said last week that they did not want to. For lo­cal lead­ers, it raises the ques­tion: Can Phoenix ever fully re­cover? And if it does, will it have a place for the peo­ple who once called it home?</p>
    <p>“When this starts get­ting cleaned up, big money will come here and in­vest, just like they did in Par­adise,” said Mr Gre­gory, whose in-laws moved north of Phoenix af­ter the Par­adise fire. “Th­ese towns won’t be back the way they were.” He steered the bus past the Harry & David head­quar­ters and to­wards the po­lice check­point that marked the start of the burn zone. Mr Gre­gory smiled and waved, and a po­lice of­fi­cer waved the bus through.</p>
    <p>Quickly, the earth was black on both sides. The bus passed pile af­ter pile of rub­ble, some still with signs telling of what was once there – a</p>
    <p>mo­tor­cy­cle shop called D&S Har­ley-David­son; the Rogue Ac­tion Cen­tre, a non-profit work­ing on cli­mate change; and Um­pqua Bank, where the only thing left stand­ing was the vault.</p>
    <p>“It gets worse ev­ery time,” Mr War­ren said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gre­gory be­gan to slow down. A woman was walk­ing along­side the road, in an area where she was not sup­posed to be. He tooted the horn, stopped and swung open the doors. “Ma’am,” he said. “Do you need a ride some­where?” She had been hik­ing back to the Home De­pot. She climbed aboard, and Mr War­ren and I hopped off.</p>
    <p>‘I’M TIRED, MY SAD­NESS GETS WORSE’</p>
    <p>We walked past a neon sign an­nounc­ing Royal Oaks Mo­bil Manor, into a sea of cin­ders. The night be­fore, I had spent an hour at the evac­u­a­tion cen­tre talking to residents of this 55-and-older mo­bile-home park, and so I di­alled one of them to see if we could find her plot.</p>
    <p>San­dra Nick­er­son, 78, a re­tired long-haul trucker, picked up. Her voice bright­ened when she heard where I was. She had been told the park was de­stroyed, but she held out hope her home was still there. Go down the mid­dle road, she said, “and take a left at the pur­ple house”. Her house num­ber was 61.</p>
    <p>There was no house, no num­bers and no pur­ple. Ev­ery­thing was grey. I apol­o­gised.</p>
    <p>“Well, OK,” she said. Ms Nick­er­son was a Phoenix lifer. She had at­tended the same brick school­house as her mother. She re­called the Fourth of July pa­rade, fish­ing on the Rogue River, and hot cakes and ham at the Phoenix truck stop. She had raised her fam­ily in Phoenix, while her hus­band drove a bus for Harry & David, shut­tling farm work­ers to the pear orchards. She had planned to die there.</p>
    <p>“I’d stay right there in Phoenix, if there was a place to live,” she said. “But there isn’t.”</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, her son picked her up from the evac­u­a­tion cen­tre and</p>
    <p>took her north to Port­land.</p>
    <p>At her mo­bile-home park, each plot was a pile of ash, with a few iden­ti­fi­able items. Metal chair frames. A bar­be­cue smoker. Hub caps. A satel­lite dish. A melted pa­tio chair floated in the pool. It was silent other than the dis­tant din of the free­way and the chirp­ing of birds perched on charred branches over­head.</p>
    <p>Mr War­ren looked weary.</p>
    <p>“Try­ing to de­scribe the de­struc­tion, re­ally the only words I can come up with are ab­so­lute,” he said. “Th­ese folks’ homes. I mean, they want to come back to sift through their stuff. But there’s noth­ing to sift through.”</p>
    <p>As for himself, he said, his voice break­ing: “I’m tired. Re­ally tired. But, you know, any time I take a break, my sad­ness gets worse.”</p>
    <p>The mo­bile-home park next to Royal Oaks was largely full of im­mi­grant farm work­ers and their fam­i­lies, and it was also razed. Be­fore last Tues­day, that park was home to David Pacheco, Ra­mona Curiel de Pacheco and their two sons. Now it was gone.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, both Mex­i­can im­mi­grants, had built a life in Phoenix. Ms Curiel de Pacheco, 48, baked cook­ies and cakes for Harry & David. Mr Pacheco, who is dis­abled, helped care for their chil­dren. Eight years ago, they bought a mo­bile home in Phoenix.</p>
    <p>“We lived at ease there,” Ms Curiel de Pacheco said in Span­ish.</p>
    <p>But they had no in­surance and al­most no sav­ings. When I asked how they were hold­ing up, Ms Curiel de Pacheco be­gan to cry.</p>
    <p>“How do you think we feel?” she said. “Ev­ery­thing of ours burned. We couldn’t even get our chil­dren’s pa­pers.” She said she had no sense of where to go next, but she was clear about one thing: “I don’t want to live in Phoenix.”</p>
    <p>A HOLE WHERE A HOME USED TO BE</p>
    <p>Back on the bus, the road be­gan to nar­row, and High­way 99 be­came Main Street. Mr Gre­gory slowed to a stop in front of four brick walls. It was Barkley’s Tav­ern, long the town’s lone bar, built in 1898.</p>
    <p>“I was the bar chap­lain,” Mr Gre­gory said, get­ting out to peer in at the charred re­mains. “Like most tav­erns, it was a place where peo­ple found a lot of fel­low­ship and friend­ship.” Faint heat still ra­di­ated from the heap. Still iden­ti­fi­able was the kitchen, where they made the broasted chicken that Mr Gre­gory loved, and the slot ma­chines, which he did not.</p>
    <p>We kept walk­ing, past the bar­ber shop, the judo academy and Puck’s Donuts – all de­stroyed. Across from the skele­ton of La Ta­p­a­tia restau­rant, Stephen Martin’s apart­ment com­plex seemed un­touched. The 52-year-old ware­house co­or­di­na­tor for Harry & David moved to Phoenix 16 years ago be­cause of the cheap rent. He paid US$500 (S$680) a month for a one-bed­room apart­ment on the town’s main drag, where many of his favourite busi­nesses were now rub­ble. Still, he planned to stick around to see what was next.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it’s go­ing to be far bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally we en­tered the ad­ja­cent town of Tal­ent and came to a clear­ing that over­looked a hol</p>
    <p>lowed-out sub­di­vi­sion. Mr Gre­gory pulled over.</p>
    <p>We looked in som­bre si­lence for a mo­ment. Be­low, two peo­ple rum­maged by a hole where a home used to be.</p>
    <p>Daniel Verner was search­ing for the box that held the ashes of his late wife. She had died of cancer 11 months ear­lier, a tragedy that led him to leave Ash­land for a new home in Tal­ent. Now his wife’s Honda Ac­cord was melted to the pave­ment out front, and he could not find her ashes.</p>
    <p>Mr Verner, 74, is a painter and mu­si­cian, spe­cial­is­ing in por­traits and tra­di­tional folk mu­sic from around the world. He plays 15 in­stru­ments and was an­gry with himself for grab­bing only two when the po­lice told him to flee.</p>
    <p>“I got my Greek bouzouki and my Ir­ish bouzouki, but I didn’t get my Rus­sian bal­alaika or my Turk­ish oud,” he said.</p>
    <p>He was shaken up by the scene. “There’s still some part of my psy­che that just goes into not be­liev­ing,” he said. “I wish I would have grabbed some more. A few more.”</p>
    <p>He was with his next-door neigh­bour Cherie Grubbs, 64, a re­tired nurse. She was search­ing the rub­ble for me­men­tos of her son, who was mur­dered in 2011, such as his gui­tar or Mother’s Day cards. In­stead, she sal­vaged a lan­tern that her fa­ther had used as a sig­naller for the rail­road, but not much else.</p>
    <p>Mr Verner cut his hand on the rub­ble, and they de­cided to go to the hospi­tal for a tetanus shot. They had hiked in a mile, so I shouted to Mr Gre­gory that they needed a lift. As we walked, Mr Verner and Ms Grubbs told me they were in a re­la­tion­ship, forged by heartache.</p>
    <p>“We kind of shared this in­cred­i­ble, un­bear­able grief,” she said. “We kind of thought we paid our grief dues.” The school bus rounded the cor­ner, and we all climbed on.</p>
    <p>‘THE FIRE JUST TOOK IT ALL’</p>
    <p>The next day, I went to church. Mr Gre­gory was set to de­liver his first ser­mon since the fire had left 10 of his parish­ioners home­less.</p>
    <p>Nearly 50 peo­ple were gath­ered on the cush­ioned seats, few with masks. A five-piece band was on the stage, with Mr Gre­gory’s wife, Doreen, on key­board. Mr Gre­gory paced on the car­pet be­low, wear­ing the same or­ange bus-driver vest over his shirt and tie.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to cry out to God for help,” he said. “How many just want to let God know we’re hurt­ing inside?” He called out to the band’s guitarist Scot­tie Alred, and asked about his project to re­model each room in his mo­bile home with a dif­fer­ent Dis­ney theme. He had been nearly fin­ished with the project, and then “the fire just took it all”, Mr Alred said. “But I am keep­ing my Dis­ney dream, and God is with me.”</p>
    <p>Mr Alred be­gan to play his elec­tric gui­tar, and the room rose and sang: “We’ve been through fire. We’ve been through rain. We’ve been re­fined, by the power of his name.” Mr Gre­gory stood in front of his con­gre­ga­tion again.</p>
    <p>“I want to take you on a jour­ney,” he said, as aerial footage of Phoenix’s de­struc­tion be­gan to play on a screen. “The Bi­ble teaches you: You don’t al­ways get to plan your jour­neys.”</p>
