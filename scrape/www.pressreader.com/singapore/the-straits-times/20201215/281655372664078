    <p>KEEP YOUR MASKS ON</p>
    <p>The first ship­ments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are ex­pected to ar­rive in Singapore by the end of this month. The na­tion has also signed agree­ments to se­cure at least two other vac­cines. The Straits Times looks at th­ese three vac­cines.</p>
    <p>In­ac­ti­vated virus: Virus is treated with heat, chem­i­cals or ra­di­a­tion to in­ac­ti­vate it and pre­vent it from repli­cat­ing, but it can still trig­ger an im­mune re­sponse to of­fer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine with pri­or­ity for healthcare work­ers, front-lin­ers, as well as vul­ner­a­ble pa­tients who do not have any med­i­cal con­traindi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>So we can­not as­sume that once you’re vac­ci­nated, you are not likely to trans­mit the virus to any other per­son and you can take off your mask and do what­ever you want.</p>
    <p>Q Mi­grant work­ers ac­counted for the over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of cases in Singapore. Are they cur­rently be­ing con­sid­ered a pri­or­ity or vul­ner­a­ble group for the vaccine?</p>
    <p>A Based on the mi­grant worker pop­u­la­tion of about 300,000, some 100,000 of them are not im­mune. So the task force will pri­ori­tise this group of work­ers over their col­leagues and the new work­ers com­ing in as re­stric­tions are re­laxed to al­low more mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>HEALTH MIN­IS­TER GAN KIM YONG</p>
    <p>Q Af­ter al­lergy is­sues oc­curred in Britain, that coun­try has is­sued an ana­phy­laxis warn­ing on the Pfizer vaccine. Are there sim­i­lar con­cerns here?</p>
    <p>A The task force is con­cerned about al­lergy re­ac­tions, said the Health Min­istry’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak.</p>
    <p>“And this is also a sim­i­lar con­cern for any other vaccine that is avail­able to­day for a va­ri­ety of dif­fer­ent con­di­tions,” As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak said.</p>
    <p>The most se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tion would be ana­phy­laxis, which may re­sult in breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties. In Britain, at least two in­di­vid­u­als dis­played fea­tures of a se­vere ana­phy­lac­tic re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, the HSA and the ex­pert com­mit­tee’s rec­om­men­da­tion is to not vac­ci­nate in­di­vid­u­als who have a his­tory of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions or ana­phy­lac­tic re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, all in­di­vid­u­als re­ceiv­ing the vac­ci­na­tion must be ob­served for a short pe­riod of time af­ter­wards to en­sure they do not have the im­me­di­ate signs of an al­ler­gic re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>If an in­di­vid­ual has an al­ler­gic re­ac­tion af­ter that first dose is given, the rec­om­men­da­tion is to not give the sec­ond dose. “We err on the side of safety,” Prof Mak added.</p>
    <p>SAFETY MEA­SURES STILL NEEDED</p>
    <p>Please un­der­stand a vaccine is not a ticket to free­dom to do any­thing you want.</p>
    <p>ED­U­CA­TION MIN­IS­TER LAWRENCE WONG</p>
    <p>Q If the take up-rate for the vac­ci­na­tion is high, will cer­tain safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures change for the peo­ple who have been vac­ci­nated?</p>
    <p>A Though the vaccine will pro­tect the per­son who has re­ceived it, there is still no clear ev­i­dence that it can pro­tect against the virus be­ing trans­mit­ted to an­other per­son, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>“So we can­not as­sume that once you’re vac­ci­nated, you are not likely to trans­mit the virus to any other per­son and you can take off your mask and do what­ever you want,” Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>Hence, de­spite vac­ci­na­tion, all safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures must still con­tinue to be ob­served. The task force will mon­i­tor the devel­op­ment in this area and ad­just the mea­sures pro­gres­sively over time.</p>
    <p>“Please un­der­stand a vaccine is not a ticket to free­dom to do any­thing you want,” Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong added.</p>
    <p>Q Once the vac­ci­na­tion plan is rolled out, will there be any changes to Singapore’s test­ing strat­egy?</p>
    <p>A The task force has to take into ac­count that more peo­ple will be vac­ci­nated next year, look at the over­all suite of mea­sures, and make ad­just­ments ac­cord­ingly, Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, with vac­ci­na­tions in place and if trav­ellers can show proof and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of vac­ci­na­tion, then the kind of test we ad­min­is­ter might well vary, be­cause we would then want to test to make sure that the per­son has an­ti­bod­ies in re­sponse to the vaccine,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing that more and more peo­ple will be vac­ci­nated, Singapore will still need the full suite of other safe­guards, but the types of tests that will be ad­min­is­tered will have to vary.</p>
    <p>The test­ing regime and pro­to­cols at the bor­ders and for events, for in­stance, will have to be ad­justed ac­cord­ingly. The task force is work­ing through all of th­ese dif­fer­ent set­tings now.</p>
