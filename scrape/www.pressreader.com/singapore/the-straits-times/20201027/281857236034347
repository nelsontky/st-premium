    <p>BEI­JING • China will im­pose sanc­tions on Amer­i­can en­ti­ties par­tic­i­pat­ing in Wash­ing­ton’s arms sales to Tai­wan, a For­eign Min­istry spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Lock­heed Martin, Boe­ing De­fence and Raytheon will be sanc­tioned, Mr Zhao Li­jian told a news con­fer­ence in the Chi­nese cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>He did not say what those sanc­tions would en­tail.</p>
    <p>The US State Depart­ment has ap­proved the po­ten­tial sale of three weapons sys­tems to Tai­wan, in­clud­ing sen­sors, mis­siles and ar­tillery that could have a to­tal value of US$1.8 bil­lion (S$2.5 bil­lion), the Pen­tagon said last week.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing con­sid­ers Tai­wan to be a way­ward prov­ince, and has vowed to bring it un­der con­trol, by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>China strongly con­demns the sale of arms to Tai­wan, said Mr Zhao. “To safe­guard our na­tional in­ter­ests, China de­cided to take nec­es­sary mea­sures and levy sanc­tions on US com­pa­nies such as Lock­heed Martin, Boe­ing De­fence, and Raytheon, and those in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies who be­haved badly in the process of the arms sales,” he added.</p>
    <p>China has sanc­tioned US com­pa­nies in the past, in­clud­ing Lock­heed Martin, for selling weapons to Tai­wan, though it is un­clear what form they have taken.</p>
    <p>The United States, like most coun­tries, has no of­fi­cial diplo­matic ties with Tai­wan, but Wash­ing­ton is bound by law to pro­vide the is­land with the means to de­fend it­self.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Boe­ing said the com­pany’s part­ner­ship with China’s avi­a­tion com­mu­nity had long-term ben­e­fits and that Boe­ing re­mained com­mit­ted to it. Boe­ing has “worked to­gether suc­cess­fully with the avi­a­tion com­mu­nity in China for al­most 50 years to sup­port Chi­nese ef­forts to en­sure a safe, ef­fi­cient and prof­itable avi­a­tion sys­tem to keep pace with the coun­try’s rapid eco­nomic growth”.</p>
    <p>Lock­heed Martin said for­eign mil­i­tary sales are gov­ern­ment-to-gov­ern­ment trans­ac­tions. It works closely with the US au­thor­i­ties and its pres­ence in China is lim­ited, it said in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has ramped up sup­port for Tai­wan through arms sales and vis­its by se­nior US of­fi­cials, adding to ten­sions in re­la­tions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton that are al­ready strained by dis­agree­ments over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, hu­man rights and trade.</p>
