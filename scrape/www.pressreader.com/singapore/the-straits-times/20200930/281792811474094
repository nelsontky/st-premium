    <p>•</p>
    <p>COVEN­TRY (Eng­land) Por­ing over her books in the li­brary at Coven­try Univer­sity, far from her home in Equa­to­rial Guinea, Ms Agnes Genoveva Cheba Ade is de­ter­mined to keep up with her stud­ies de­spite Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>She ad­mits it has not been easy be­ing abroad dur­ing a pan­demic, with many courses moved on­line and so­cial­is­ing re­stricted.</p>
    <p>“I spent the pan­demic away from my fam­ily so the iso­la­tion was even harder for me,” said Ms Cheba Ade, a for­mer Miss World con­tes­tant, who has been study­ing eco­nomic sciences at Coven­try Univer­sity in cen­tral Eng­land since 2017.</p>
    <p>“I was strug­gling with anx­i­ety, de­pres­sion at times and I felt a lit­tle bit over­whelmed.” But she added: “I’m from a hum­ble fam­ily so... be­ing here to­day at univer­sity, be­ing able to com­plete my course and get my de­gree... I think it’s really some­thing I have to cher­ish ev­ery day.”</p>
    <p>On cam­pus, where classes re­sumed in the mid­dle of this month par­tially on­line, re­minders for stu­dents to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing are ev­ery­where. Ac­cess to the li­brary is one-way, the route is pep­pered with hand sani­tiser sta­tions and stu­dents must re­serve a place – then dis­in­fect their work­sta­tion with the wipes pro­vided.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing a mask is en­cour­aged but not oblig­a­tory.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents’ so­cial lives are also lim­ited, with many wel­com­ing events held vir­tu­ally, which is a challenge for new ar­rivals try­ing to set­tle in, said Mr Ge­orge Okata, a mem­ber of Coven­try’s stu­dent body.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has had some 42,000 deaths in the out­break – the worst in Europe – and mil­lions of peo­ple are un­der re­newed lo­cal re­stric­tions due to a surge in cases.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish govern­ment has tight­ened re­stric­tions on so­cial­is­ing in parts of north-east Eng­land.</p>
    <p>From to­day, res­i­dents in seven ar­eas in­clud­ing ur­ban cen­tres such as</p>
    <p>(right), from Equa­to­rial Guinea, who has been study­ing eco­nomic sciences at Coven­try Univer­sity in cen­tral Eng­land since 2017.</p>
    <p>New­cas­tle, Gateshead, Sun­der­land and Durham will be barred from so­cial­is­ing in­doors with peo­ple from out­side their house­hold or strictly de­fined so­cial bub­ble.</p>
    <p>The curbs will ap­ply in homes, pubs and restau­rants, and peo­ple who fail to com­ply will face fines en­force­able by law, the Health Min­istry said. Coro­n­avirus in­ci­dence rates were above 100 per 100,000 in six of the seven ar­eas last week.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, the num­ber of cases con­tin­ues to rise sharply,” Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said, an­nounc­ing the new re­stric­tions in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“We know a large num­ber of th­ese in­fec­tions are tak­ing place in in­door set­tings out­side the home. And so, at the re­quest of the lo­cal coun­cils, with whom we’ve been work­ing closely, we will in­tro­duce le­gal re­stric­tions on in­door mix­ing</p>
    <p>Above: Stu­dents in Coven­try Univer­sity at the begin­ning of the new aca­demic year on Sept 23. On cam­pus, re­minders for stu­dents to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing are ev­ery­where. be­tween house­holds in any set­ting,” he said.</p>
    <p>Schools and work­places will not be af­fected by the re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Over 30 uni­ver­si­ties around Bri­tain have re­ported more than 717 Covid-19 cases among stu­dents and staff since the new school term started ear­lier this month, with thou­sands of stu­dents in self-iso­la­tion, lo­cal me­dia said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester Metropoli­tan Univer­sity, for in­stance, has asked around 1,700 stu­dents to self-iso­late after 127 cases were con­firmed. The Univer­sity of Glas­gow has 172 con­firmed cases, with 600 stu­dents self-iso­lat­ing, said Sky News.</p>
    <p>Up un­til now, Coven­try Univer­sity has not ex­pe­ri­enced the clus­ters of cases seen at other Bri­tish uni­ver­si­ties, which – of­ten after il­le­gal par­ties – caused them to iso­late hundreds of stu­dents.</p>
    <p>For­eign stu­dents from out­side the Euro­pean Union pay sig­nif­i­cantly more than Bri­tish or EU stu­dents, and their fees are a ma­jor source of in­come for uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>In Coven­try Univer­sity, they nor­mally make up one-third of the 35,000-strong stu­dent body. The num­ber of for­eign reg­is­tra­tions has halved this month. How­ever, provost Ian Dunn said many were tak­ing up the op­tion of­fered rou­tinely by the univer­sity to start in Jan­uary, or even wait un­til May.</p>
    <p>De­spite pes­simistic pre­dic­tions that for­eign stu­dent numbers might col­lapse this au­tumn, ap­pli­ca­tions body Uni­ver­si­ties and Col­leges Ad­mis­sions Ser­vice (UCAS) has seen a 9 per cent in­crease in in­ter­na­tional un­der­grad­u­ate ad­mis­sions, although EU ap­pli­ca­tions fell 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this is not enough to re­lieve the pres­sure on uni­ver­si­ties, which have in­vested heav­ily in on­line learn­ing and are also pre­par­ing for the end of the post-Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Nick Hill­man, from the Higher Ed­u­ca­tion Pol­icy In­sti­tute think-tank, cau­tioned that reg­is­tra­tion data “doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily mean all those peo­ple will ac­tu­ally turn up”. He also pointed out that a lot of in­ter­na­tional stu­dents were post­grad­u­ates, who were not in­cluded in the UCAS fig­ures.</p>
    <p>And there was a “real worry that dropout rates might go up this year, be­cause when they (the stu­dents) get to univer­sity, their ex­pe­ri­ence might not be quite what they ex­pected”, he said.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­si­ties UK, which rep­re­sents higher ed­u­ca­tion in­sti­tu­tions, said it was un­clear how many in­ter­na­tional stu­dents who had re­ceived of­fers would take up their places.</p>
    <p>Some in­sti­tu­tions, like Queen’s Univer­sity Belfast, have de­cided to leave noth­ing to chance, char­ter­ing a flight to bring in hundreds of Chi­nese stu­dents, The Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>I’m from a hum­ble fam­ily so, for me, be­ing here to­day at univer­sity, be­ing able to com­plete my course and get my de­gree... I think it’s really some­thing I have to cher­ish ev­ery day.</p>
