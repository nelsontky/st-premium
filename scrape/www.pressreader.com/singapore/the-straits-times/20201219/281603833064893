    <p>More than 400 mu­sic fans turned up at the Sands Theatre at Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) for a pop con­cert last night, the big­gest mu­sic event with a live au­di­ence since mea­sures to curb the pan­demic kicked in ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>In line with the Min­istry of Health’s pi­lot of pre-event test­ing, ev­ery­one in the au­di­ence had to have a neg­a­tive anti­gen rapid or poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test re­sult be­fore they were al­lowed into the venue.</p>
    <p>The 9pm show, fea­tur­ing singers Ben­jamin Kheng, Sezairi, Narelle, Liny­ing and rap­per TheLionCi­tyBoy, was the first of a two-night con­cert ti­tled Back To Live. The sec­ond con­cert will take place at the same venue to­day.</p>
    <p>The anti­gen rapid tests were free for mem­bers of the au­di­ence, who each paid $55 for sin­gle-night tick­ets or $98 for two-day tick­ets.</p>
    <p>Those who bought tick­ets to both nights took their swab tests at a ball­room in MBS from 5.30pm to 7.30pm and re­ceived their re­sults half an hour later. The rest took their tests else­where at des­ig­nated clin­ics ear­lier on the same day.</p>
    <p>Ms Mina Liu, a 33-year-old de­signer who was tak­ing the swab test for the first time, was one of the first to ar­rive for the test at MBS.</p>
    <p>She said: “The whole process of tak­ing the test was smoother than I imag­ined. It stung a lit­tle but it was quick and easy for me, and I was in and out within five min­utes.”</p>
    <p>Prod­uct de­signer Luq­man Mo­hamed, 31, said he did not mind be­ing tested as it was im­por­tant to have safety mea­sures for a largescale event like the con­cert.</p>
    <p>“It gives me com­fort to know that ev­ery­one in the con­cert hall around me has tested neg­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>There were oth­ers such as Ms Sabrina Ooi who found it in­con­ve­nient to have to rush from work to reach the venue early for test­ing. Still, the 30-year-old founder of a start-up that fo­cuses on men­tal health said get­ting to ex­pe­ri­ence a con­cert live again was worth the has­sle.</p>
    <p>“The test was quick and com­fort­able. The swab only went in 2.5cm up my nose. The pre­vi­ous tests that I had went in even fur­ther. But I’m just glad to be here. It’s about time con­certs are back – we’re all al­ready go­ing to restau­rants and wed­dings any­way,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Back To Live con­certs are or­gan­ised by AEG Presents and events agency Col­lec­tive Minds, and sup­ported by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board.</p>
    <p>Last night’s con­cert also marked the re­open­ing of the Sands Theatre, which can hold up to 2,155 guests and had been closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
