    <p>The is­sue of ath­lete abuse has been in the spot­light in re­cent months, with the Net­flix doc­u­men­tary Ath­lete A on USA Gym­nas­tics doc­tor Larry Nas­sar’s sex­ual as­sault of young ath­letes prompt­ing many to come for­ward to share their own ex­pe­ri­ences of men­tal and phys­i­cal ill treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Among them were for­mer Sin­ga­porean fig­ure skater Yu Shu­ran and ex-na­tional gym­nast Eileen Chai, who spoke out about their ex­pe­ri­ences while train­ing in China.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts from Sin­ga­pore, Ja­pan and In­dia weighed in on the topic yes­ter­day in the first Safe Sport in Asia we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG).</p>
    <p>Tat­suo Oka, deputy sec­re­tary gen­eral and head of the vi­o­lence con­sul­ta­tion ser­vice at the Ja­pan Sport As­so­ci­a­tion, said that from Novem­ber 2014 to March this year, it was con­sulted on 618 cases con­cern­ing vi­o­lent be­hav­iour in sport. These in­cluded the use of abu­sive lan­guage, power ha­rass­ment and vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Most of the cases in­volved school chil­dren (43.5 per cent), and those who con­sulted them were mainly their guardians (58.8 per cent).</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the data, Oka high­lighted the im­por­tance of ed­u­cat­ing par­ents about safe sport, par­tic­u­larly as most of the cases in­volved mi­nors.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard for kids to ex­press them­selves in terms of feel­ing and vo­cab­u­lary. And they nor­mally think oth­ers are right so they just ac­cept what adults say. They can’t un­der­stand what’s right or wrong,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Many adults think cor­po­ral pun­ish­ment is needed, so we need to ed­u­cate peo­ple that that’s what was nor­mal in the past.”</p>
    <p>Masamitsu Ito, a sports coach­ing pro­fes­sor at Nip­pon Sport Sci­ence Uni­ver­sity (NSSU) agreed that a cul­tural shift is needed for sport to be­come safer for ath­letes.</p>
    <p>He said: “This is not just a sport prob­lem but a so­cial prob­lem as well. It’s cul­ture so we need to ed­u­cate ev­ery­body. If we can change sport, maybe sport can be the trig­ger to change so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that elders, teach­ers and coaches are typ­i­cally ac­corded a high de­gree of re­spect in Asian so­ci­ety, Azhar Yu­sof, SportSG’s head of CoachSG, said that it is im­por­tant to have oth­ers un­der­stand that the “power re­la­tion­ship” could be­come “high risk</p>
    <p>GAME CHANGER</p>
    <p>This is not just a sport prob­lem but a so­cial prob­lem as well. It’s cul­ture so we need to ed­u­cate ev­ery­body. If we can change sport, maybe sport can be the trig­ger to change so­ci­ety. ’’</p>
    <p>MASAMITSU ITO, Nip­pon Sport Sci­ence Uni­ver­sity pro­fes­sor, on pro­mot­ing safe sport and pro­tect­ing ath­letes.</p>
    <p>in re­la­tion to safe sport”.</p>
    <p>“So it’s time for us to re­flect and re­think our own coach­ing prac­tices and ask our­selves whether things that were deemed ac­cept­able last time are still ac­cept­able now.”</p>
    <p>To pro­mote safe sport and pro­tect ath­letes, Ja­pan has been fo­cus­ing on coach ed­u­ca­tion and devel­op­ment through the NSSU Coach De­vel­oper Acad­emy, which was started in 2014.</p>
    <p>On cor­po­ral pun­ish­ment in sport, Prof Ito, who is also the acad­emy’s deputy di­rec­tor, noted that there are coaches who “truly be­lieve what they’re do­ing is right be­cause it was what they ex­pe­ri­enced in the past”.</p>
    <p>“So we want to reach out to coaches who haven’t ex­pe­ri­enced learner-cen­tred coach­ing last time and sup­port them in ac­quir­ing new skill sets.”</p>
    <p>In­dian Olympic As­so­ci­a­tion ex­pert Pranav Maggu said it has mea­sures to help pre­vent abuse, as well as av­enues for ath­letes to ad­dress their griev­ances. These in­clude ed­u­cat­ing chil­dren on how to iden­tify good touch and bad touch, en­sur­ing that fe­male of­fi­cials are as­signed to ac­com­pany fe­male ath­letes and teams, and ap­point­ing at least one safe sport li­ai­son of­fi­cer per na­tional fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Safe Sport Com­mis­sion was launched last year to look into pre­ven­tive mea­sures to safe­guard ath­letes, coaches and other par­tic­i­pants. Nearly 100 safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers have been trained and of the 64 na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions, fewer than 10 have yet to ap­point a safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
