    <p>•</p>
    <p>South Korea re­bounded from re­ces­sion more strongly than ex­pected last quar­ter, as the fastest ex­port-growth in decades helped buf­fer the econ­omy from a sum­mer wave of the coro­n­avirus that weighed on con­sumers.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) rose 1.9 per cent i n the three months through Septem­ber from the prior quar­ter, the Bank of Korea (BOK) re­ported yes­ter­day. Econ­o­mists had fore­cast 1.3 per cent growth.</p>
    <p>The big­gest jump in ex­ports since 1986 drove the trade-de­pen­dent na­tion’s re­bound from two quar­ters of con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s econ­omy is com­ing back from its pan­demic-trig­gered re­ces­sion in a stronger po­si­tion than most de­vel­oped na­tions.</p>
    <p>Al­though the re­cov­ery is vul­ner­a­ble to dis­rup­tions in the United States and Europe, where the epi­demic is wors­en­ing, the coun­try’s key chip ex­ports are ben­e­fit­ing from a global shift to work-and study-from-home and China is sup­port­ing de­mand.</p>
    <p>“This speaks to the re­silience of a man­u­fac­tur­ing pow­er­house,” said econ­o­mist Oh Jae-young at KB Se­cu­ri­ties, adding: “South Korea’s man­u­fac­tur­ing has re­mained un­scathed from the pan­demic and now, as de­vel­oped economies them­selves restart pro­duc­tion, South Korea’s get­ting a boost.”</p>
    <p>Last quar­ter’s ex­port re­cov­ery fu­elled the big­gest in­crease in fa­cil­i­ties in­vest­ment since 2012, led by spend­ing on ma­chin­ery and trans­porta­tion equip­ment, the BOK said.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing grew 7.6 per cent, the most since 2009.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer spend­ing is also likely to im­prove af­ter slip­ping last quar­ter. A late sum­mer resur­gence of coro­n­avirus cases in South Korea that led to tighter so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules has eased in re­cent weeks and Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in has said the coun­try should seize the chance to restart its re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>De­spite a sec­ond-half re­cov­ery, pri­vate sec­tor an­a­lysts see GDP shrink­ing for the full year for the first time since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>The BOK this month pointed to signs of eco­nomic green shoots while hold­ing its key in­ter­est rate at a record low.</p>
