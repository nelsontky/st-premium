    <p>When their daugh­ter Ee­shaa was born in 2005, Ms Shub­hada Bhide and her hus­band Ashish Thakar, both 43, did not take pho­tos.</p>
    <p>“We were not in the men­tal state to do so,” says the IT pro­fes­sional of the “mad­den­ing” time af­ter her wa­ter broke at an es­ti­mated 24 to 26 weeks and she was asked to de­liver nor­mally.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors in Hy­der­abad, In­dia, where the cou­ple then lived, were not op­ti­mistic about their baby’s chances of sur­vival and had pre­pared them for the worst.</p>
    <p>To ev­ery­one’s sur­prise, Ee­shaa started cry­ing. Her fa­ther was over­come with emo­tion when he saw her move her head and limbs.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally felt it was a mir­a­cle,” Mr Thakar says, adding that he has goose­bumps telling the story again.</p>
    <p>Against the odds, her lungs were fully formed and she did not need a ven­ti­la­tor for breath­ing sup­port like other pre­emies, just oxy­gen.</p>
    <p>Ee­shaa had to un­dergo a mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing pro­ce­dure to check on her brain devel­op­ment dur­ing her three months in the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit and she cleared the test.</p>
    <p>The lit­tle fighter also over­came episodes of sleep ap­nea, where an in­fant stops breath­ing dur­ing sleep, and sep­sis, a se­vere in­fec­tion in very young ba­bies.</p>
    <p>Both con­di­tions are com­mon in preterm ba­bies.</p>
    <p>Just as the cou­ple were set­tling into life with a baby back at home, Mr Thakar re­ceived a job of­fer in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They de­cided to make the move in 2006, see­ing how Ee­shaa had caught up with her devel­op­ment mile­stones at four months and was even rolling on the bed. “She was very hy­per­ac­tive,” Mr Thakar says.</p>
    <p>Ee­shaa did not have ma­jor health is­sues, although her weak im­mu­nity meant that she got sick ev­ery month or two, un­til things sta­bilised when she was in Pri­mary 5.</p>
    <p>She also de­vel­oped a peanut al­lergy in Pri­mary 1, but out­grew it later.</p>
    <p>The Thakars, who are per­ma­nent res­i­dents in Sin­ga­pore, con­sid­ered de­lay­ing Pri­mary 1 for a year since their daugh­ter was pre­ma­ture and born in De­cem­ber, but even­tu­ally en­rolled her.</p>
    <p>Ee­shaa sur­prised them and “coped quite well” aca­dem­i­cally, her mother says. They also have a son, Shri­haan, eight.</p>
    <p>Ms Bhide says she tries to be mind­ful of what the doc­tors told her about the learn­ing curve for pre­ma­ture chil­dren. “One day, they don’t know any­thing. The next day, they know ev­ery­thing. It’s a late bloomer kind of thing.”</p>
    <p>To­day, Ee­shaa, who turns 15 next month and is al­most the same height as her mother, looks like any other Sec­ondary 3 stu­dent.</p>
    <p>Ms Bhide proudly says that Ee­shaa is a stu­dent leader and cocur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity leader in the neigh­bour­hood school, and is in­ter­ested in a ca­reer in the med­i­cal field.</p>
    <p>Ms Bhide, who blogs about par­ent­ing at rain­bow­di­aries.com, still feels over­pro­tec­tive about her first­born, even as she ac­knowl­edges that the nat­u­ral-born war­rior can al­ready stand up for her­self.</p>
    <p>“We see that streak when­ever some­thing goes wrong in school or she wants to prove a point or get so many marks in a sub­ject. She’ll put in hard work.”</p>
    <p>If there is one thing Ms Bhide can share with anx­ious new par­ents of pre­emies, it is this: “They are all fight­ers and they know how to han­dle things, sooner or later.”</p>
