    <p>BEI­JING • China re­ported the most num­ber of do­mes­tic coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in more than four months as it bat­tles out­breaks in its western and north-east­ern re­gions, rais­ing fears of a se­ri­ous resur­gence.</p>
    <p>The jump in cases is the worst flare-up since China con­tained its first epi­demic in March, which cen­tred on Wuhan in Hubei province, where the virus first emerged.</p>
    <p>Of the 61 in­fec­tions re­ported yes­ter­day, 57 were lo­cal cases, with 41 of them in Xin­jiang, the po­lit­i­cally fraught western province where China’s treat­ment of the lo­cal Mus­lim Uighur pop­u­la­tion has come un­der global crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>The rest were found i n and around north-east­ern Liaon­ing province, cen­tred on its port city of</p>
    <p>Dalian. Cases linked to Dalian have al­ready spread to sev­eral cities across the three north-east prov­inces, as well as the south­ern province of Fu­jian.</p>
    <p>The spikes of in­fec­tion un­der­score the near-im­pos­si­bil­ity of stamp­ing out the pathogen, even by a coun­try ca­pa­ble of re­spond­ing quickly and fe­ro­ciously.</p>
    <p>De­spite its suc­cess in con­tain­ing a first wave that in­fected more than 80,000, mostly in Hubei province, China has been play­ing whack-a-mole with the virus as it re-emerges in places from south­ern man­u­fac­tur­ing hub Guangzhou and north-east­ern border province Hei­longjiang, to the all-im­por­tant po­lit­i­cal cen­tre of Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>With the lat­est out­breaks, of­fi­cials ap­pear to be us­ing the same play­book of rapid mass test­ing cou­pled with tar­geted lock­down re­stric­tions. In Urumqi city, the cap­i­tal of Xin­jiang province, sub­way and bus ser­vices have been cut off for more than a week, while hous­ing com­pounds limit the num­ber of peo­ple who can go in and out.</p>
    <p>In Dalian, of­fi­cials said over the week­end that they would be­gin test­ing the en­tire city pop­u­la­tion of around six mil­lion, repli­cat­ing the ef­fort in Wuhan ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>That test­ing blitz in China’s orig­i­nal epi­cen­tre un­earthed hun­dreds of asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions, and ap­pears to have suc­ceeded in cut­ting off hid­den chains of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>China’s cen­tral govern­ment is send­ing aid to Dalian, with Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion head Ma Xiaowei lead­ing a team there.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma called for the city to empty a hos­pi­tal in 24 hours to ad­mit Covid-19 pa­tients, said a state­ment pub­lished on the com­mis­sion web­site on Sun­day.</p>
