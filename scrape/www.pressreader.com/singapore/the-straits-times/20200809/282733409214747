    <p>Hooray for her­itage</p>
    <p>It was a sad day when pas­try chef Pang Kok Keong had to close An­toinette, his patis­serie. But for some time now, he has been spread­ing his wings be­yond the fine cakes he was known for. Peo­ple who have had his Hakka food will know just how good his aba­cus seeds, thun­der tea rice, radish balls and leek kueh are. We traipsed to an al­ley be­hind An­toinette to col­lect these good­ies.</p>
    <p>Now, we can head to Xin Tekka in Lit­tle In­dia for our Hakka fix. Pang has opened Pang’s Hakka Noo­dles, sell­ing food from his di­alect group. He puts so much love into it. Yes, the cakes were oh-so-fine. But soul food is way more sat­is­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>That is why I will al­ways want the gutsy, ro­bust and sweat-in­duc­ing dishes chef Damian d’Silva is known for. His lat­est stage is Restau­rant Kin at Straits Clan in Bukit Pa­soh. Buah keluak fried rice, singgang and kueh bengkah are just three things I am in se­ri­ous love with. I’m still wait­ing for the hop­pers, chef.</p>
    <p>Home cooks are dig­ging out her­itage recipes and cre­at­ing home-based food busi­nesses out of them.</p>
    <p>Brindha Vish­wanathan of Bat­ter Mat­ters sells rib­bon mu­rukku she makes at home, up­dated with flavours such as gar­lic and parme­san and in pretty jars.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can chef David Chang of Mo­mo­fuku fame once told a chef friend of mine that he could not pos­si­bly sell his pork buns in Sin­ga­pore be­cause, well, every fam­ily has an heir­loom recipe for it and will be able to cri­tique his fiercely. He is right.</p>
    <p>But I will al­ways have room in my belly for Chris­tine Yue’s lor bak, a recipe handed down from her grand­mother to her mother and now to her. She calls her­self Lor Bak Mama and sells it from her home, this homey dish of pork belly braised to sub­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>And on the dessert front, her­itage is on proud dis­play. Kueh salat from Chalk Farm is non­pareil. Kueh am­bon, the yeasted kueh with the hon­ey­comb crumb, from The Honey Comb Cake makes me sali­vate. It is near-im­pos­si­ble to get a de­cent, store-bought one. I must be quicker on the draw when the or­der­ing win­dow for this home-based busi­ness opens.</p>
    <p>The dis­ap­pear­ance of Per­anakan Khek makes me mad. The shop in Ca­van Road sold Per­anakan kueh made by Sharon Low, who is Khek. Why does do­ing busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore have to be so hard? Why does some­one do­ing her best to cham­pion our food her­itage have to face ob­sta­cles at every turn? I long for a taste of her kueh putu­gal.</p>
