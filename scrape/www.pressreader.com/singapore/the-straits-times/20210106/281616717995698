    <p>The pan­demic has height­ened re­think­ing among econ­o­mists about how to cre­ate jobs. Many now think stan­dard stim­u­lus mea­sures might not be enough. And the idea gain­ing trac­tion is a job guar­an­tee scheme, un­der which the gov­ern­ment cre­ates enough jobs to ab­sorb all job seek­ers, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Vikram Khanna.</p>
    <p>While 2021 will be a bet­ter year for Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic growth than 2020, it’s not clear how much bet­ter it will be for jobs.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say that the labour mar­ket de­cline is mod­er­at­ing, but there is still a de­cline.</p>
    <p>In the third quar­ter of last year, to­tal em­ploy­ment (ex­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers) de­clined by 29,100.</p>
    <p>While this was an im­prove­ment over the plunge of more than 103,000 in the sec­ond quar­ter, the di­rec­tion didn’t change.</p>
    <p>Re­trench­ments also rose to</p>
    <p>9,120 in the third quar­ter, com­pared with 8,130 in the sec­ond quar­ter and 10,690 for the whole of 2019. Al­most 90 per cent of those re­trenched in the third quar­ter were per­ma­nent staff, as op­posed to con­tract work­ers.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo has cau­tioned that go­ing for­ward, “we will still see re­trench­ments”.</p>
    <p>As econ­o­mists have pointed out, these could hap­pen both be­cause the re­cov­ery will be un­even and for struc­tural rea­sons – some jobs will be­come ob­so­lete and never re­turn, while many of those cre­ated will need skills that job seek­ers lack.</p>
    <p>Job match­ing has proven chal­leng­ing. While 58,300 lo­cal job seek­ers were placed into work and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties from April to Oc­to­ber, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power’s lat­est jobs re­port in the mid­dle of last month, there are still more than 123,000 open­ings avail­able.</p>
    <p>We don’t know how many of these will be filled, or how many train­ing po­si­tions and at­tach­ments will trans­late into full-time jobs, although trainees may in­crease their chances of em­ploy­ment in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In the years ahead, more labour mar­ket dis­rup­tions can be ex­pected, with ris­ing au­to­ma­tion, the de­ploy­ment of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence – which will af­fect the white-col­lar sec­tor – and job off­shoring, which has be­come eas­ier with more dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and a “work from home” cul­ture, which also means “work from any­where”.</p>
    <p>Many economies are fac­ing sim­i­lar is­sues as Sin­ga­pore. Some, such as Bri­tain and parts of the United States and the Euro­pean Union, which are fac­ing new waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tions and im­pos­ing lock­downs, are far­ing worse. With vac­cine roll-outs likely to be stretched over sev­eral months, job losses are set to rise be­fore the sit­u­a­tion im­proves.</p>
    <p>RE­THINK­ING JOB CRE­ATION</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has height­ened re­think­ing among econ­o­mists about how to cre­ate jobs. Many have come to the con­clu­sion that stan­dard stim­u­lus mea­sures, in­clud­ing wage sub­si­dies, might not be enough.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus of the dis­cus­sion is not about con­trol­ling un­em­ploy­ment, but end­ing it.</p>
    <p>The idea gain­ing trac­tion is that of a job guar­an­tee scheme, un­der which the gov­ern­ment cre­ates enough jobs to ab­sorb all job seek­ers. Any­one able and will­ing to work can be as­sured of a job at a liv­ing wage and ba­sic ben­e­fits, re­gard­less of qual­i­fi­ca­tions, ex­pe­ri­ence or dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>This is not a new idea. It was pur­sued in the US dur­ing the Great De­pres­sion of the 1930s un­der the New Deal pro­moted by the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent Franklin D. Roo­sevelt, but was later aban­doned be­cause it was con­sid­ered a cri­sis pol­icy.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, lim­ited vari­ants of it have been pur­sued by Ar­gentina in 2001 and by In­dia since 2005, un­der the Na­tional Ru­ral Em­ploy­ment Guar­an­tee Scheme, which as­sures 100 days of work per year for one mem­ber of ev­ery family in ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>These at­tempts have pro­duced pos­i­tive re­sults, although they have been par­tial, and ap­pli­ca­ble to only some sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent cham­pi­ons of the job guar­an­tee scheme aim for some­thing more am­bi­tious: They pro­pose that gov­ern­ments cre­ate enough jobs for all of the un­em­ployed, in all sec­tors.</p>
    <p>They come from across the ide­o­log­i­cal spec­trum, rang­ing from left-lean­ing pro­po­nents of mod­ern mone­tary the­ory such as eco­nom­ics pro­fes­sors Stephanie Kel­ton and Pavlina Tch­erneva, and cen­trist pol­i­cy­mak­ers such as for­mer US Trea­sury sec­re­tary Robert Ru­bin, to tra­di­tional Key­ne­sian econ­o­mists like Pro­fes­sor Robert Skidel­sky and even the for­mer chair­man of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Coun­cil of Eco­nomic Ad­vis­ers Kevin Has­sett.</p>
    <p>The key ra­tio­nale for a job guar­an­tee scheme is that the pri­vate sec­tor can­not be counted on to cre­ate enough jobs to ab­sorb all of the un­em­ployed even dur­ing good times, let alone re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists have tra­di­tion­ally ac­cepted that a cer­tain amount of un­em­ploy­ment is a fact of life and even de­sir­able, be­cause it helps com­bat in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>There is the con­cept of a “nat­u­ral rate of un­em­ploy­ment” also called the “non-ac­cel­er­at­ing in­fla­tion rate of un­em­ploy­ment” (Nairu) – a sup­posed sweet spot of around 4 per cent, de­not­ing the low­est un­em­ploy­ment rate that should be tol­er­ated, to pre­vent in­fla­tion from ac­cel­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>But in re­cent years, the con­cept of Nairu has been dis­cred­ited.</p>
    <p>For more than a decade un­til last year, we have wit­nessed falling rates of un­em­ploy­ment with no sign of in­fla­tion. In fact, de­fla­tion has been the big­ger threat in most ad­vanced economies.</p>
    <p>The pro­po­nents of a job guar­an­tee scheme re­ject the no­tion of the nat­u­ral rate of un­em­ploy­ment. They point out that there is no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for this any more than there is a jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for a nat­u­ral rate of home­less­ness, il­lit­er­acy or hunger.</p>
    <p>So they sug­gest that since the pri­vate sec­tor can­not cre­ate enough jobs for all, the gov­ern­ment should step in, by cre­at­ing jobs di­rectly, not through in­cen­tives or nudges such as wage or loan sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Although these can help, they can­not solve the prob­lem and they are any­way tem­po­rary.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment-cre­ated jobs should gen­er­ate so­cial, rather than com­mer­cial, value and should not repli­cate jobs cre­ated by the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has al­ready cre­ated some such jobs dur­ing the pan­demic, such as safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors, ca­reer coun­sel­lors, dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors and con­tact trac­ers – all of whom per­form vi­tal so­cial roles.</p>
    <p>Other ideas for so­cial value-cre­at­ing jobs from around the world in­clude com­pan­ions for the el­derly or peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, artistes for com­mu­nity the­atres and con­certs, oral history writ­ers, ur­ban farm­ers on pub­lic land, com­mu­nity fair or­gan­is­ers, guides for pub­lic art gal­leries and mu­se­ums, retrofitte­rs for old build­ings, tool-lend­ing li­brar­i­ans and coun­sel­lors for prison in­mates.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery com­mu­nity will have its own list of so­cially valu­able jobs that fill some gap. Ideas can be sourced from com­mu­nity-level or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Some jobs might need train­ing, for ex­am­ple, those re­lated to el­der­care or coun­selling. So train­ing would be an im­por­tant part of a job guar­an­tee scheme.</p>
    <p>But the dif­fer­ence from typ­i­cal present ar­range­ments is that there would be a guar­an­teed job at the end of the train­ing.</p>
    <p>The idea is to “train and place” rather than “train and hope”. It’s not about train­ing peo­ple for jobs that may or may not ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>MANY ECO­NOMIC BEN­E­FITS</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic ben­e­fits of a job guar­an­tee scheme would be man­i­fold.</p>
    <p>By vir­tu­ally elim­i­nat­ing un­em­ploy­ment, it would boost de­mand, eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and growth, which would also ben­e­fit the pri­vate sec­tor as well as tax rev­enue.</p>
    <p>It would also cre­ate a floor for wages and thereby re­duce in­equal­ity. It would pay a min­i­mum wage, but the main con­cern as­so­ci­ated with the min­i­mum wage – that it would lead to un­em­ploy­ment – would be elim­i­nated be­cause the scheme would, by def­i­ni­tion, guar­an­tee jobs for the un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>It would also pres­sure pri­vate em­ploy­ers to raise wages at the low end, which in the Sin­ga­pore con­text would en­able the pro­gres­sive wage model – which aims to raise wages of low-in­come work­ers – to spread faster across sec­tors, au­to­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>And by keep­ing oth­er­wise un­em­ployed work­ers pro­duc­tively oc­cu­pied, it would im­prove their em­ploy­a­bil­ity. Em­ploy­ers typ­i­cally pre­fer hir­ing from the ranks of the al­ready em­ployed than from the un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>Given its eco­nomic ben­e­fits, Mr Ru­bin points out that a job guar­an­tee scheme “should be viewed not as a so­cial pro­gramme, but as a “pub­lic in­vest­ment with a high rate of re­turn”.</p>
    <p>VARI­ABLE SIZE AND COST</p>
    <p>The size and cost of the scheme would ad­just de­pend­ing on pri­vate-sec­tor hir­ing.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing re­ces­sions (such as now), when pri­vate-sec­tor hir­ing is lim­ited and re­trench­ments are con­tin­u­ing, the scheme would ex­pand. Dur­ing boom times, when pri­vate-sec­tor hir­ing picks up, work­ers would leave the scheme, which would then con­tract.</p>
    <p>The cost of the scheme would there­fore vary from time to time.</p>
    <p>Ideally, it should be an item in the bud­get, with higher al­lo­ca­tions dur­ing re­ces­sions and lower al­lo­ca­tions dur­ing booms.</p>
    <p>In the (un­likely) ex­treme case where the pri­vate sec­tor is able to hire all the work­ers in the econ­omy, the cost of the scheme would be near zero.</p>
    <p>And what would it cost when it is “ex­pen­sive”? A back-of-theen­ve­lope cal­cu­la­tion for Sin­ga­pore sug­gests that as­sum­ing an un­em­ploy­ment rate of 5 per cent, which amounts to around 185,000 work­ers and a wage of $1,500 a month per worker, the wage costs of a job guar­an­tee scheme would be around $3.5 billion a year – al­low­ing for some ad­min­is­tra­tive ex­penses – or about 0.7 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) in­tro­duced in the Bud­get, which was aimed at pre­serv­ing jobs, cost more than</p>
    <p>$16 billion, or more than 3 per cent of GDP.</p>
    <p>To be sure, this is not a fair com­par­i­son. If not for the JSS, which also sub­sidised mid-level wages, un­em­ploy­ment would al­most cer­tainly be far higher than 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>But even if it was dou­ble that, a job guar­an­tee scheme would still be value for money.</p>
    <p>It would also yield sav­ings on costs re­lated to un­em­ploy­ment, such as grant pay­ments and other in­come-sup­port mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Plus, there would be sav­ings on non-fi­nan­cial costs as­so­ci­ated with un­em­ploy­ment which are of­ten un­ac­counted for, such as family stress, health prob­lems and the ero­sion of skills.</p>
    <p>There would be chal­lenges as­so­ci­ated with a job guar­an­tee scheme. Parts of the pri­vate sec­tor might not be able to raise low-end wages to the level of­fered by the scheme and thus stand to lose work­ers, although this would de­pend on the wage level that is set. Cre­at­ing enough so­cially valu­able jobs may also be a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>But, in many ways, Sin­ga­pore is well placed to launch a job guar­an­tee scheme.</p>
    <p>Much of the in­fra­struc­ture al­ready ex­ists, in the form of com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions, well-funded train­ing schemes, jobs and skills cen­tres – which could be­come place­ment cen­tres – and ad­min­is­tra­tive ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic sec­tor has also been hir­ing dur­ing the down­turn.</p>
    <p>It would only need to take this to an­other level.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment-cre­ated jobs should gen­er­ate so­cial, rather than com­mer­cial, value and should not repli­cate jobs cre­ated by the pri­vate sec­tor. Sin­ga­pore has al­ready cre­ated some such jobs dur­ing the pan­demic, such as safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors, ca­reer coun­sel­lors, dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors and con­tact trac­ers – all of whom per­form vi­tal so­cial roles.</p>
