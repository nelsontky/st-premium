    <p>More than 4kg of heroin was found in a toi­let bowl and other spots in a Bukit Ba­tok Hous­ing Board flat dur­ing a Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau (CNB) oper­a­tion on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The drug bust net­ted a to­tal of 5,130g of heroin, 1,125g of metham­phetamine also known as Ice, 13g of new psy­choac­tive sub­stances and 20 Erimin-5 tablets, CNB said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to the seized drugs, es­ti­mated to be worth al­most $700,000, CNB of­fi­cers also re­cov­ered $174,000 in cash.</p>
    <p>CNB of­fi­cers in­ter­cepted a ve­hi­cle in Sun­set Way on Mon­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>They arrested two Sin­ga­pore­ans, a 44-year-old man and a 37-year-old woman, and seized 10 pack­ets con­tain­ing 80g of heroin af­ter search­ing their ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate CNB team raided an HDB flat in Bukit Ba­tok Street 31, where they be­lieved they would find a 63-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who had met the 44-year-old ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the CNB of­fi­cers could en­ter the flat, the 63-year-old man climbed out of the kitchen win­dow and fell.</p>
    <p>He was pro­nounced dead by Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force of­fi­cers when they ar­rived at the scene.</p>
    <p>Two more peo­ple – a 65-year-old Sin­ga­porean man and a 33-year-old woman, a for­eign na­tional, – were nabbed in the same Bukit Ba­tok flat.</p>
    <p>Drugs in­clud­ing 4,790g of heroin were re­cov­ered from var­i­ous parts of the flat by CNB of­fi­cers who also found the $174,000 cash haul.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day evening, CNB of­fi­cers also raided a shop­house unit in Tan­jong Pa­gar Road.</p>
    <p>Two Sin­ga­porean men, aged 62 and 64, were arrested and CNB of­fi­cers also seized 35 pack­ets con­tain­ing 260g of heroin, and 1g of Ice from the shop­house.</p>
    <p>CNB said that in­ves­ti­ga­tions are un­der way, adding that the po­lice are look­ing into the 63-year-old man’s death.</p>
