    <p>BE­LOW $400</p>
    <p>AMAZFIT T-REX $219</p>
    <p>The rugged Amazfit T-Rex re­sem­bles a Ca­sio G-Shock. While it looks bulky and can stand some pun­ish­ment, it is a rel­a­tive light­weight at 58g. The dis­play is big and bright – easy to see in bright sun­light.</p>
    <p>The watch, which runs on its own op­er­at­ing sys­tem, has an in­ter­face that is less in­tu­itive than its com­peti­tors re­viewed here. It also does not sup­port SpO2, the mea­sure­ment of the oxy­gen level in your blood.</p>
    <p>In terms of step track­ing, read­ings are about 4 per cent off from those of my per­sonal, cal­i­brated Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4. For GPS-tracked runs, its read­ings for my usual 5km route are up to 250m off.</p>
    <p>Re­views of its sleep track­ing are mixed. My sleep­ing and wak­ing times are ac­cu­rately recorded. While the watch shows the du­ra­tion of my sleep stages, I find the awake tim­ings to be too long – some­times 30 min­utes – when I do not even re­mem­ber wak­ing to go to the toi­let.</p>
    <p>The best part about the T-Rex is its long bat­tery life. It lasts 20 days on a full charge, with three 5km GPS-tracked runs.</p>
    <p>GARMIN VENU SQ $379</p>
    <p>This is an af­ford­able smart­watch with great fit­ness track­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties. It comes with an op­ti­cal heart-rate sen­sor with SpO2 track­ing, built-in GPS work­out track­ing and stress track­ing.</p>
    <p>The Venu Sq looks like a mini Ap­ple Watch, with­out a ro­tat­ing crown, but with two but­tons on its right. It is light­weight and com­fort­able to wear.</p>
    <p>It does not of­fer much as a smart­watch. For in­stance, you can­not tap on no­ti­fi­ca­tions to ex­pand to view. Also, there are few watch face op­tions.</p>
    <p>But the Venu Sq is pretty ac­cu­rate in fit­ness track­ing. For step track­ing, its read­ings are only 80 steps off my Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4’s. For GPS-tracked runs, its read­ings are only around</p>
    <p>120m shorter than my 5km route.</p>
    <p>Sleep track­ing is dis­ap­point­ing, though. It is un­able to pin­point the time I sleep and wake ac­cu­rately. Some­times, it does not au­to­mat­i­cally track sleep.</p>
    <p>How­ever, its bat­tery life is bet­ter than many of its com­peti­tors’, drop­ping to only 30 per cent at the end of three days.</p>
    <p>HUAWEI WATCH GT 2 PRO $398</p>
    <p>Launched just this month, this smart­watch is a pre­mium ver­sion of the fit­ness-cen­tric Huawei Watch GT 2e ($218) re­leased in May.</p>
    <p>The GT 2 Pro comes with a sap­phire glass dis­play with a ti­ta­nium frame and ce­ramic back. It ex­udes the same pre­mium feel as the Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 6, but at a much more wal­let-friendly price. It even comes with an SpO2 sen­sor.</p>
    <p>It runs on Huawei’s LiteOS op­er­at­ing sys­tem, which is in­tu­itive and al­most as re­fined as Ap­ple’s watchOS 7.</p>
    <p>Its step-track­ing read­ings vary by only about 3 per cent from those recorded by my Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4. On GPS-tracked runs, the dis­tance read­ings are off by only 100m.</p>
    <p>It is in sleep track­ing that the GT 2 Pro shines. It knows the ex­act time I go to bed and wake up, even the time I get up to use the toi­let.</p>
    <p>The app shows sleep-cy­cle graphs that break sleep pat­terns into deep, light and REM sleep, pro­vid­ing in­sights into sleep qual­ity.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is ex­cel­lent, with half the juice left af­ter a week of use.</p>
    <p>AP­PLE WATCH SE­RIES 6</p>
    <p>From $599</p>
    <p>The lat­est of­fer­ing in the Ap­ple watch se­ries looks like its pre­de­ces­sors and you can use your cur­rent Ap­ple Watch bands with it.</p>
    <p>The new watch has sev­eral up­grades, in­clud­ing a faster S6 chip, an al­ways-on al­time­ter, and a brighter dis­play for eas­ier view­ing in sunny con­di­tions. It can also mea­sure the oxy­gen level in your blood, also known as SpO2.</p>
    <p>With watchOS 7, the Se­ries 6 can now track sleep, but, un­like its com­peti­tors, it does not do so au­to­mat­i­cally. You have to set the sleep and wake time. Also, it records only your sleep­ing hours – with no break­down of light and deep sleep.</p>
    <p>But in terms of step track­ing, the Se­ries 6 does a su­perb job. The read­ings are very close to those of my per­sonal, cal­i­brated Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4, with a mere dif­fer­ence of 50 steps. On my usual 5km jog­ging route, the GPS-tracked runs by the Se­ries 6 are only 10m to 20m off.</p>
    <p>A big downer is the bat­tery life. The bat­tery level drops to 50 per cent by the end of a day, so you should prob­a­bly charge the watch be­fore you go to bed.</p>
    <p>It is still the best smart­watch for an in­tu­itive in­ter­face and ca­pa­ble fit­ness fea­tures. Un­for­tu­nately, it is also the only smart­watch here that does not sup­port An­droid phones.</p>
    <p>SAM­SUNG GALAXY WATCH3</p>
    <p>From $648</p>
    <p>The Sam­sung Galaxy Watch3 re­tains the gor­geous looks of its pre­de­ces­sor, along with the se­ries’ unique ro­tat­ing bezel.</p>
    <p>This bezel lets you nav­i­gate the smart­watch’s in­ter­face with­out block­ing the dis­play. And by turn­ing it, you can eas­ily scroll through the watch’s Tizen op­er­at­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>When con­nected to an An­droid phone, no­ti­fi­ca­tions ap­pear as tiles you can tap on.</p>
    <p>The watch can mea­sure SpO2. But its elec­tro­car­dio­gram mea­sure­ment – found in the Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 6 – is not avail­able yet, pend­ing ap­proval by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Un­like the Ap­ple watch, this de­vice au­to­mat­i­cally tracks sleep and sleep qual­ity.</p>
    <p>Step track­ing is ac­cu­rate. The watch reg­is­ters only 1.5 per cent more steps than my Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4. On my 5km jog­ging route, the GPS tracks only 50m more than the ac­tual dis­tance.</p>
    <p>The watch has about 30 per cent power left at the end of two days.</p>
    <p>FIT­BIT SENSE $488</p>
    <p>Fit­bit’s new flag­ship smart­watch looks no dif­fer­ent from its pre­vi­ous one, the Versa 2. But it now comes with a stain­less steel, in­stead of alu­minium, frame.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures built-in GPS, can es­ti­mate your SpO2 lev­els, and is the first smart­watch to have an elec­tro­der­mal ac­tiv­ity sen­sor, which tracks the body’s re­sponse to stress.</p>
    <p>To take an elec­tro­der­mal ac­tiv­ity read­ing, place your palm over the en­tire screen – touch­ing all four sides of the de­vice – for two min­utes. This read­ing will com­bine with your heart rate, heart-rate vari­abil­ity and sleep pat­terns to give you a stress score (lower means more stress).</p>
    <p>I find Sense’s sleep mon­i­tor­ing to be spot on. It ac­cu­rately pin­points my sleep­ing and wak­ing times, and shows the dif­fer­ent sleep stages – rapid eye move­ment, light and deep sleep.</p>
    <p>The step-track­ing func­tion records up to a 6 per cent dif­fer­ence com­pared with my Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4. But the dis­tance it records is only about 60m shorter than my 5km route.</p>
    <p>Rated to last six days on a full charge, the watch has 20 per cent bat­tery life left at the end of five days.</p>
