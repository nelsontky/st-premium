    <p>Ms Nu­rul Ati­rah Mah­mud­din cel­e­brated her 34th birth­day with two stay­ca­tions – one at SO Sof­i­tel Sin­ga­pore and an­other at Con­rad Cen­ten­nial Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The first stay­ca­tion from Dec 21 to Dec 22 was a sur­prise from her hus­band who paid the full price.</p>
    <p>Ms Ati­rah then de­cided to treat her­self and her loved ones to the Fam­ily Es­cape pack­age she found on book­ing plat­form Klook. She paid $320 for a two-day, one-night stay on Dec 22 and 23, after us­ing her $100 Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers to off­set the cost.</p>
    <p>The mother of four ex­tended her birth­day va­ca­tion as she wanted a longer break to spend with her fam­ily. “When I’m work­ing from home, I some­times have to put my kids’ needs on hold. It has been crazy, jug­gling work and tak­ing care of my 16-month-old daugh­ter,” said the civil ser­vant, who has two other daugh­ters – Mu­nize and Mishel, aged six and nine, and a four-year-old son, Maqil.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily spent a re­lax­ing day in the ho­tel play­ing snakes and lad­ders and ended the evening with the Dis­ney film Mal­e­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>“The kids packed their toys and we bought our own bath bomb from Lush. The ho­tel even pro­vided a rub­ber duck for the bath. My kids loved it,” she said.</p>
    <p>Although they spent only one night in the ho­tel, Ms Ati­rah was able to squeeze in some time for self care since the ho­tel is con­ve­niently lo­cated in Ma­rina Bay.</p>
    <p>“I had a mas­sage at Sun­tec City and my son man­aged to get a hair­cut too,” she said.</p>
