    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish artist Heather Phillip­son’s lat­est work is a 9.4m statue of a dol­lop of whipped cream, with a cherry, fly and drone on it.</p>
    <p>This one has not been easy. In March, the work was meant to be in­stalled on an empty plinth in Trafal­gar Square, the lat­est in a se­ries of com­mis­sions that brings con­tem­po­rary art to the cen­tral Lon­don plaza. But on the day the in­stal­la­tion was sched­uled to be­gin, Bri­tain went into lock­down.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, she was hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions with city of­fi­cials about whether the work could be in­stalled dur­ing the pan­demic at all. The work’s ti­tle, The End, did not have the best con­no­ta­tions at a mo­ment when thou­sands were dy­ing.</p>
    <p>“It started to feel like there’d never be a good time, or a right time, for it to go up,” Phillip­son said in a re­cent in­ter­view at her East Lon­don stu­dio.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, The End was fi­nally un­veiled. Phillip­son said the work was con­ceived in 2016, not long af­ter Bri­tain voted to leave the Euro­pean Union, and she had wanted the creamy sculp­ture, which looks as if it could ooze off its plat­form, to look pre­car­i­ous be­cause that was how the world felt back then. Re­cently, she added, things have got­ten worse. But peo­ple could read the statue how­ever they wanted, she said: She would even be happy if they just saw it as a bit of fun.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally, I’m drawn to stuff that baf­fles me,” she said. “If I don’t get it, that’s when I’m hooked.” En­joy­ing be­ing con­fused is cen­tral to the charm of the artist’s works, whose bright, over-the-top ex­te­ri­ors of­ten be­lie their dark, ur­gent mes­sages about en­vi­ron­men­tal de­struc­tion or hu­man­ity’s treat­ment of an­i­mals. She is a ve­gan (since “be­fore it was fash­ion­able”) and her in­ter­views are lit­tered with talk of im­pend­ing plan­e­tary doom.</p>
    <p>The End is a more am­bigu­ous piece, but a huge planned in­stal­la­tion at Tate Bri­tain is per­haps more typ­i­cal: Phillip­son will turn the mu­seum’s cen­tral gallery into “a suite of de­ranged land­scapes, ad­dress­ing the earth as a think­ing erup­tion, on the verge of ter­mi­na­tion”, she said. That work was sup­posed to be un­veiled this sum­mer, but has been post­poned be­cause of the coro­n­avirus and is now sched­uled for next year.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Phillip­son made a 79mlong in­stal­la­tion on a dis­used sub­way plat­form in Lon­don. The work fea­tured TV screens that seemed to be walk­ing on gi­ant chicken legs, and car­toon­ish egg sculp­tures, some of which ap­peared to be re­leas­ing bad smells.</p>
    <p>“It is all enough to turn you ve­gan,” critic Adrian Searle wrote in a re­view for The Guardian.</p>
    <p>Phillip­son in­sisted her work was not sim­ply about her po­lit­i­cal views or life­style choices. “Yes, I’m a ve­gan, but I’m also a woman, a fem­i­nist. All kinds of things feed into my art be­cause what­ever ide­olo­gies I have will be in there at some level. But I’m not pre­sent­ing an ar­gu­ment.”</p>
    <p>Ms Iwona Blazwick, di­rec­tor of Lon­don’s Whitechape­l Gallery, which has com­mis­sioned work by Phillip­son, said her art man­aged to be both “hi­lar­i­ous and ter­ri­fy­ing at the same time”.</p>
    <p>“She re­minds me of the Sur­re­al­ists, ac­tu­ally,” Ms Blazwick said.</p>
    <p>Like them, Phillip­son jux­ta­poses un­re­lated items to give them new mean­ing. “That is what sets her apart and makes her a great sculp­tor,” Ms Blazwick added.</p>
    <p>In her stu­dio, Phillip­son – who has no gallery rep­re­sen­ta­tion and worked as an of­fice ad­min­is­tra­tor un­til about five years ago – seemed sur­prised by her re­cent suc­cess. She never ex­pected to get the</p>
    <p>Fourth Plinth com­mis­sion, she said. When she re­ceived an e-mail in 2016 invit­ing her to sub­mit an idea, her re­sponse, she said, was: “This is hi­lar­i­ous. There’s no way I’m go­ing to get it.”</p>
    <p>Born in Lon­don, she spent much of her teenage years in ru­ral Wales. Her mother was a so­cial worker and her fa­ther a mu­si­cian who also made art and wrote poetry. Phillip­son is a prize-win­ning poet her­self, has DJed at il­le­gal raves and makes sound col­lages that have played on BBC ra­dio.</p>
    <p>She said she could not re­mem­ber any spe­cific mo­ment that turned her onto art – it was al­ways there, she said. Like­wise, she added, she could not re­mem­ber a time when she did not fear for the planet’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>But she in­sisted her world­view was not ac­tu­ally just about doom and gloom. “The world is a dis­turb­ing place, isn’t it? But there’s a lot of joy in there,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her works are “hold­ing a po­si­tion of con­flict” be­tween those points, she added.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day morn­ing, as soon as The End emerged from un­der­neath a huge black sheet, the few passers-by in Trafal­gar Square stopped to gawk at it, then take photos with be­mused smiles.</p>
    <p>Three com­muters and one tourist from Bel­gium all said they liked the work. “I love it,” said Ms Ch­eryl Lawrence, a scuba div­ing in­struc­tor. “It’s colour­ful, it’s fes­tive.” When told about Phillip­son’s po­lit­i­cal mo­ti­va­tions in mak­ing the work, she waved the com­ment away.</p>
    <p>“The av­er­age per­son isn’t go­ing to think about that,” she said: “It’ll prob­a­bly just make them want an ice cream.”</p>
