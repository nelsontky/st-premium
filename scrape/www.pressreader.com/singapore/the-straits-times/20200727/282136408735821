    <p>By all ac­counts, Ms Lim Geok Shan is the quin­tes­sen­tial aca­demic over­achiever, with a schol­ar­ship from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) and a place on the dean’s list for three years run­ning from 2016.</p>
    <p>But the 26-year-old is quick to point out that she was noth­ing like that be­fore en­rolling in the Bach­e­lor of Sci­ence (In­for­ma­tion Sys­tems) pro­gramme in 2016.</p>
    <p>She scored straight Cs in her A lev­els in 2012, and was re­jected when she first ap­plied for a place in SMU’s in­for­ma­tion sys­tems pro­gramme the next year.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said she “felt like a fail­ure in life” be­cause, with two older brothers suf­fer­ing from vis­ual im­pair­ments, the weight of ex­pec­ta­tions was on her young shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>She even­tu­ally gained en­try into SMU, and was one of 1,884 grad­u­ates to re­ceive their bach­e­lor’s de­gree last Fri­day from the univer­sity, which held a vir­tual grad­u­a­tion and ca­reer fair to mark the oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>Of the group, 56 grad­u­ated with dou­ble de­grees. There were also 989 master’s de­gree and Ju­ris Doc­tor de­gree grad­u­ates, and 48 oth­ers who re­ceived their doc­tor­ates.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said that in the three years af­ter her A lev­els, she did ev­ery­thing from work­ing in a cof­fee shop to run­ning a blogshop.</p>
    <p>“Apart from prac­ti­cal skills like learn­ing to deal with peo­ple from dif­fer­ent walks of life, and cop­ing with stress and time man­age­ment, it re­ally helped me grow as a per­son.”</p>
    <p>She had started the blogshop with a friend when she was in Anderson Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>For about a year af­ter the A lev­els, she ran the on­line store by sourc­ing for clothes and var­i­ous tech gad­gets on Chi­nese e-com­merce site Taobao.</p>
    <p>A good day would see her make $500 a night.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim later helped run her un­cle’s cof­fee shop, where she man­aged staff, some of whom were three times her age, and co­or­di­nated with sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>In the third year af­ter her A lev­els, she worked in an ad­min­is­tra­tive role for a real es­tate com­pany.</p>
    <p>There she learnt that her univer­sity-grad­u­ate col­leagues were earn­ing sig­nif­i­cantly more than her.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim de­cided to try for a place in SMU again, although she was aware her straight C grades did not meet the cut-off for the in­for­ma­tion sys­tems pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>As a back-up plan, she also ap­plied to read sci­ence at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and biomed­i­cal sci­ence at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>By then, Ms Lim had saved up al­most $30,000 to pay her way through school. Her fa­ther is a tech­ni­cian and her mother, a clerk.</p>
    <p>SMU replied and said she had to sit a tech­ni­cal as­sess­ment test in ba­sic pro­gram­ming skills, which she passed.</p>
    <p>FIND­ING SENSE OF SELF</p>
    <p>We tend to form our iden­tity based on th­ese re­sults or track records, but it’s more im­por­tant to find our sense of self. ’’</p>
    <p>MS LIM GEOK SHAN, about the three years she spent work­ing be­fore reap­ply­ing for a place in SMU’s in­for­ma­tion sys­tems pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the three-year break, she had honed her skills by tak­ing up ad hoc Web de­sign as­sign­ments.</p>
    <p>Next month, Ms Lim will be join­ing DBS Bank’s Skill En­hance­ment Ed­u­ca­tion and De­vel­op­ment pro­gramme – a 24-month train­ing pro­gramme for en­gi­neers in the tech and in­no­va­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“So­ci­ety places a lot of em­pha­sis on re­sults and out­comes. But look­ing back, so what if I didn’t do well in the A lev­els?</p>
    <p>“We tend to form our iden­tity based on th­ese re­sults or track records, but it’s more im­por­tant to find our sense of self,” Ms Lim said of the three years she spent work­ing.</p>
    <p>SMU said last Fri­day’s event was meant to of­fer grad­u­ates a plat­form to re­live the best mo­ments of their univer­sity ex­pe­ri­ence, as well as in­ter­act with po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal com­mence­ment cer­e­monies will be held at a later date, when al­lowed, the univer­sity added.</p>
