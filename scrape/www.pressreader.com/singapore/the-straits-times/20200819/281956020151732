    <p>BERLIN • Dr An­gela Merkel has re­fused to be drawn on whether Mr Ar­min Laschet, the Pre­mier of Ger­many’s most pop­u­lous state, should suc­ceed her as chan­cel­lor, say­ing only that he was a can­di­date with many qual­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Laschet, Pre­mier of the western state of North Rhine-West­phalia, is one of the lead­ing can­di­dates to run as the chan­cel­lor can­di­date of the con­ser­va­tive bloc.</p>
    <p>His main ri­val is Mr Markus Soeder, Pre­mier of Bavaria.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways said I will not get in­volved in the de­bate about a suc­ces­sor for the po­si­tion I have or had,” she said. “Ar­min Laschet is run­ning and, as the Pre­mier of North Rhine-West­phalia, he brings a lot of qual­i­fi­ca­tions with him. But other than that, I won’t get in­volved.”</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel was speak­ing at a news con­fer­ence with Mr Laschet after at­tend­ing a meet­ing of the state’s Cab­i­net yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last month, she gave a sim­i­lar non-com­mit­tal re­sponse after at­tend­ing a ses­sion of the Bavar­ian Cab­i­net – an event marked by royal op­tics that fu­elled spec­u­la­tion over Mr Soeder’s own prospects as a fu­ture chan­cel­lor – de­clin­ing to in­di­cate sup­port for any can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Mr Laschet has stum­bled in his bid to seize the lead­er­ship of the Chris­tian Demo­cratic Union (CDU) – a role which would make him the front run­ner to suc­ceed Dr Merkel as chan­cel­lor when she leaves of­fice after the next elec­tion due in the au­tumn of 2021.</p>
    <p>Mr Soeder heads the Chris­tian So­cial Union, the CDU’s Bavar­ian sis­ter party. Polls show the CDU/CSU can­di­date will most likely be the next chan­cel­lor.</p>
    <p>The party lead­er­ship con­test was also dis­rupted by the an­nounce­ment last week that Fi­nance Min­is­ter Olaf Scholz will run as the So­cial Democrats’ chan­cel­lor can­di­date, a rare demon­stra­tion of party unity more than a year be­fore the elec­tion is due.</p>
