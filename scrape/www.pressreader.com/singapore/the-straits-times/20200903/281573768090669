    <p>Gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies for pub­lic trans­port have sky­rock­eted. And with Covid-19, lower rid­er­ship means lower fare rev­enue. It is time to re-imag­ine sus­tain­able al­ter­na­tives, says se­nior trans­port cor­re­spon­dent Christo­pher Tan (below).</p>
    <p>In April, I wrote a col­umn here on how lower de­mand for trans­port brought about by Covid-19 al­lows us to re-ex­am­ine some trans­port fun­da­men­tals.</p>
    <p>I sug­gested that cy­cling, im­prov­ing pedes­trian walk­ways and right-sizing ca­pac­ity can lead to a greener, more ef­fi­cient and sus­tain­able trans­port sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Events in re­cent weeks show that it is more press­ing than ever to em­bark on this new jour­ney – and these are to do with mount­ing sub­si­dies for pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has, in a good part of the last sev­eral decades, man­aged to keep a lid on sub­si­dies and yet have a pub­lic trans­port sys­tem that hummed along.</p>
    <p>But things be­gan to un­ravel some 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>Com­muters were un­happy – first with crowded and in­fre­quent buses (re­flected in sat­is­fac­tion sur­veys as early as 2003); and then with crowded and glitch-prone train ser­vices, which came to a head with two ma­jor break­downs in 2011, fol­lowed by more break­downs for sev­eral more years.</p>
    <p>Fix­ing the prob­lems re­quired bil­lions in gov­ern­ment funds, start­ing with the Bus Ser­vice En­hance­ment Pro­gramme in 2012, Gov­ern­ment Bus Con­tract­ing Model in 2016, the on­go­ing re­ju­ve­na­tion of the North-South and East-West MRT lines, and the New Rail Fi­nanc­ing Frame­work which was com­pleted in 2018.</p>
    <p>To­day, com­muter sat­is­fac­tion is at its high­est ever. But so is the level of gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies for pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>More than $500 mil­lion in sub­si­dies was in­curred by the MRT for the 2019 fi­nan­cial year, and an­other $1 bil­lion or so by buses. These are op­er­at­ing sub­si­dies and ex­clude bil­lions in tax money spent on in­fra­struc­ture and fixed as­sets.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19, things will only get worse. The pan­demic has led to a sharp drop in pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship, which means a plunge in fare rev­enue. Hence gov­ern­ment spend­ing will most likely con­tinue to bal­loon. Is this sus­tain­able, given that fi­nite funds will also have to go to­wards prop­ping up sev­eral other sec­tors?</p>
    <p>The an­swer is clearly, no. But scal­ing back on sub­si­dies will of­ten mean scal­ing back on ser­vice, too. The re­cent up­heaval over changes to bus routes in Bukit Pan­jang is a case in point.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents were miffed be­cause the changes – in­clud­ing the re­moval of a city-bound ser­vice – mean longer travel times, even with the Down­town MRT line, which con­nects Bukit Pan­jang to the</p>
    <p>Cen­tral Busi­ness District (CBD).</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment rea­soned that it had to strike a bal­ance between com­muter in­ter­ests and tax spend­ing. It added that the Bukit Pan­jang stretch of the Down­town Line alone cost $60 mil­lion a year in sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>This is a peren­nial ten­sion between seem­ingly op­pos­ing in­ter­ests, and there are ways to re­duce it. We could, for in­stance, look to na­tion­al­is­ing buses and trains. In such a model, there would be lit­tle or no ten­sion between who pays for what. Rather, pub­lic trans­port would then be viewed purely as a pub­lic good – one of many that pre­serves the city’s long-term vi­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>This op­tion would re­bal­ance the bur­den cur­rently borne by com­muters, tax­pay­ers and op­er­a­tors. That, how­ever, is un­likely to change the over­all cost of trans­port. To do that, we need to change the way the city moves.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic of­fers us a golden op­por­tu­nity to do this.</p>
    <p>WHAT ARE THE OP­TIONS?</p>
    <p>As with sev­eral other cities, cy­cling has be­come more pop­u­lar here as peo­ple seek to avoid crowds. We can cap­i­talise on this nascent trend and de­velop an ecosys­tem where cy­cling can be­come a per­ma­nent com­mut­ing op­tion. Plans are afoot to tre­ble the cy­cling path net­work to 1,320km by 2030. Hope­fully, it does not stop there.</p>
    <p>As the vast ma­jor­ity of com­mutes here are within 10km – many within 5km – they can be com­pleted quite eas­ily by bi­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>Cy­cling is en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly, good for health and ex­tremely cost-ef­fi­cient – to both the user and the state. Some folks will say the weather here is not ideal for cy­cling, but which city is, un­less it is com­pletely air-con­di­tioned?</p>
    <p>Next, the virtues of telecom­mut­ing should not be for­got­ten, even if we man­age to over­come the Covid-19 cri­sis. Work­ing from home re­duces the load on a city’s trans­port in­fra­struc­ture, which is costly to build and costlier to main­tain.</p>
    <p>It also im­proves work ef­fi­ciency and qual­ity of life be­cause it helps us re­claim up to three hours a day spent com­mut­ing.</p>
    <p>But work­ing from home is not con­ducive to many who live in small flats. Even ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist Finian Tan, who lives in a 10,000 sq ft house, told The Sun­day Times re­cently that he has had to hold meet­ings on his yacht be­cause his house is “full of lit­tle chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home can be iso­lat­ing, too. For those whose jobs re­quire close col­lab­o­ra­tion with col­leagues, it is not ideal, even if it is quite necessary now.</p>
    <p>Hence neigh­bour­hood co-work­ing spa­ces should be set up, prefer­ably oc­cu­py­ing ex­ist­ing spa­ces va­cated by failed busi­nesses or even va­cant build­ings slated for re­de­vel­op­ment that has been put on hold.</p>
    <p>This will go to­wards min­imis­ing the need to com­mute long dis­tances for work, and per­haps make ac­tive mo­bil­ity op­tions such as cy­cling more at­trac­tive.</p>
    <p>We can also in­tro­duce stag­gered sched­ules for the CBD, with each build­ing al­lowed to have a per­cent­age of work­ers turn­ing up each day. This will al­low com­pa­nies to im­ple­ment hot-de­sk­ing, or main­tain the same num­ber of em­ploy­ees with­out the need for larger premises to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Lastly, cars. Even if pri­vate mo­torised trans­porta­tion is a sub­stan­tial con­trib­u­tor to the tax cof­fers, it ex­erts a heavy toll on a city’s well-be­ing. Road space, ac­ci­dents, air and noise pol­lu­tion, and the eco­nomic cost of con­ges­tions are the main ex­ter­nal­i­ties any city can have less of.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the ve­hi­cle quota sys­tem has been an effective pop­u­la­tion con­trol, but we need a more effective us­age-con­trol mech­a­nism to op­ti­mise road us­age.</p>
    <p>Dis­tance-based Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) al­lows us to do just that be­cause driv­ers are charged pre­cisely ac­cord­ing to the kilo­me­tres they clock. It is a far sharper con­ges­tion-man­age­ment tool than the cur­rent static gantry-based sys­tem, which al­lows driv­ers to drive as much as they want once they pass a cer­tain gantry.</p>
    <p>But that project – which started in 2016 and was slated to be rolled out from this year – has been in the slow lane.</p>
    <p>In this year’s Bud­get, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said “the tech­nol­ogy to do this prop­erly... is still sev­eral years away”.</p>
    <p>This is a shame. Af­ter all, the Land Trans­port Author­ity awarded NCS-Mit­subishi Heavy In­dus­tries $556 mil­lion to build the sys­tem four years ago af­ter con­duct­ing ex­ten­sive tri­als that proved its vi­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>It is also a pity be­cause dis­tance-based ERP al­lows us to cal­i­brate com­mut­ing be­hav­iour in­finites­i­mally. Done well, it will in­form driv­ers the cost of driv­ing even be­fore they get into a car, al­low­ing for bet­ter de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Hence, in my opin­ion, it is the sin­gle most effective way to en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore to go “car-lite” – not ride-shar­ing or au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles, which, more likely than not, will lead to higher road us­age.</p>
    <p>A BET­TER WAY AHEAD</p>
    <p>A car-lite city can re­claim space oc­cu­pied by roads for cy­clists, pedes­tri­ans and green­ery.</p>
    <p>This will go some way to­wards nur­tur­ing a health­ier and more self-re­liant pop­u­lace.</p>
    <p>What will all these steps to re­shape trans­port mean for ex­ist­ing stake­hold­ers in the cur­rent re­source-heavy, sub­sidy-de­pen­dent ecosys­tem?</p>
    <p>That is an im­por­tant ques­tion, but it should not be one that pre­vents us from re-eval­u­at­ing the sta­tus quo, to see if there is a bet­ter way ahead.</p>
    <p>It should, how­ever, be noted that all these mea­sures do not negate the need for an ef­fi­cient bus and train net­work. They merely re­dis­tribute de­mand, and hope­fully keep a lid on ca­pac­ity and the huge costs that come with in­creas­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The bet­ter way for­ward is not all that hard to fathom. There are scores of cities far older than ours, each with its own take on tran­sit-ori­ented de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>We can learn from the best suc­cess sto­ries. Copenhagen for its cy­cling cul­ture, Hong Kong for con­nec­tiv­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity of its trans­port nodes, Tokyo for its vi­brant un­der­ground net­work, Seoul for its bold move to re­move a high­way to re­vi­talise a de­cay­ing down­town, New York City for its walk­a­bil­ity, and the list goes on.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had its own suc­cess sto­ries. And when it fails, it has been rel­a­tively quick to rec­tify the prob­lems, largely be­cause of its healthy fi­nan­cials.</p>
    <p>But the road ahead will be more chal­leng­ing as more com­pet­ing needs arise, as new rail projects fan­ning out from the city cen­tre face es­ca­lat­ing costs and lower rid­er­ship, as more bus ser­vices are ra­tio­nalised, and as a grow­ing af­flu­ent class is in­creas­ingly de­nied ac­cess to a per­sonal car.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic-in­duced slow­down gives us room to step back and re-imag­ine how the city moves in the next sev­eral decades. Let us all – plan­ners, op­er­a­tors and com­muters – seize it.</p>
