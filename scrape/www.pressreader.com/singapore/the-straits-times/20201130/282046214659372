    <p>Pub­lic spa­ces in Sin­ga­pore have been de­signed to be un­wel­come to the home­less – and as a re­sponse to cit­i­zens com­plain­ing about rough sleep­ers in their midst, ac­cord­ing to ar­chi­tects and ex­perts.</p>
    <p>With an uptick in rough-sleep­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Gov­ern­ment and community part­ners have stepped up to build more shel­ters. Gov­ern­ment data in July re­vealed that some 800 home­less fam­i­lies and in­di­vid­u­als were oc­cu­py­ing these shel­ters.</p>
    <p>Last year, a na­tion­wide count led by As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ng Kok Hoe from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy found 1,050 peo­ple sleep­ing rough on the streets.</p>
    <p>Prof Ng and other ob­servers pointed to the grow­ing preva­lence of pub­lic benches with di­viders or metal bars on them, as well as benches con­verted to sin­gle seats, say­ing they are prime ex­am­ples of ur­ban fea­tures that are “de­fen­sive” or “hos­tile” to­wards the home­less.</p>
    <p>Asked about the di­viders, a Build</p>
    <p>ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity spokesman said they were arm­rests for the el­derly or peo­ple with mo­bil­ity dif­fi­cul­ties, and to help them get up from the benches.</p>
    <p>But town coun­cils and MPs ap­proached by The Straits Times said these di­viders were in­stalled to de­ter rough sleep­ing and loi­ter­ing, and arose from res­i­dents’ feed­back.</p>
    <p>Prof Ng said the ef­fect of such de­signs was to deny home­less peo­ple a safe and shel­tered place to lie down and rest. This could also end</p>
    <p>up driv­ing them to more con­cealed lo­ca­tions that are less safe and harder for out­reach vol­un­teers to ac­cess, he added.</p>
    <p>Ar­chi­tects who pre­vi­ously worked on pub­lic-sec­tor projects told ST they were asked to pro­duce de­signs de­lib­er­ately hos­tile to the home­less. “They would tell us – it’s too smooth, you need to make it rougher, put lit­tle metal studs, make it un­com­fort­able,” said one ar­chi­tect, who asked to re­main anony­mous.</p>
    <p>A guide­book pro­duced by the Na­tional Crime Pre­ven­tion Coun­cil in 2003 ad­vises that “sit­ting rails in­stead of benches should be pro­vided to pre­vent peo­ple from sleep­ing in bus shel­ters or taxi stands”. Of­fi­cials from the coun­cil said the book has not been up­dated since, as its guide­lines re­main rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Chong Keng Hua from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD) said this stance can be di­rectly at­trib­uted to res­i­dents voic­ing dis­com­fort with the pres­ence of home­less peo­ple at their void decks, and a gen­eral de­sire for the Gov­ern­ment to “solve the prob­lem and hide them away”.</p>
    <p>His ob­ser­va­tion, gleaned from community en­gage­ment ef­forts, was mir­rored by Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­ogy pro­fes­sor Daniel Goh.</p>
    <p>“The more com­plaints, the more pres­sure on agen­cies to ad­dress this,” said the for­mer Work­ers’ Party Non-Con­stituency MP. “If there’s any­body to blame, it’s not the Gov­ern­ment, it’s so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>While some in the in­dus­try have called for greater re­search into the so­ci­etal ef­fects of such de­signs, oth­ers are ad­vo­cat­ing more open, vis­i­ble de­signs as a way for­ward.</p>
    <p>At the 2020 Sin­ga­pore Ar­chi­tec­tural Fes­ti­val (Archifest), lo­cally based firm WY-TO part­nered Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic to ex­hibit a pro­to­type light­weight and trans­portable shel­ter for the home­less.</p>
    <p>“We are de­sign­ing this to show that the home­less de­serve bet­ter sleep­ing en­vi­ron­ments,” said WYTO founder Yann Fol­lain. “Peo­ple will surely com­plain about hav­ing such a shel­ter in their es­tates, but it will also trig­ger con­ver­sa­tions about what we can do.”</p>
    <p>Said SUTD’s Prof Chong: “The dif­fi­cult part is get­ting the community to un­der­stand that they some­times need to be more gra­cious and re­cep­tive to peo­ple who are strug­gling, and to wel­come dif­fer­ent peo­ple to co­ex­ist within a neigh­bour­hood.”</p>
