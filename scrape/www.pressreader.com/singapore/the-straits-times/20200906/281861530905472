    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump con­fronted a po­lit­i­cal cri­sis on Fri­day that could un­der­cut badly needed sup­port in the mil­i­tary com­mu­nity for his re­elec­tion cam­paign, as he sought to dis­pute a re­port that he pri­vately re­ferred to Amer­i­can sol­diers killed in com­bat as “losers” and “suck­ers”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has long por­trayed him­self as a cham­pion of the armed forces and has boasted of re­build­ing a mil­i­tary de­pleted af­ter years of over­seas wars, came un­der in­tense fire from Democrats and other op­po­nents who said a re­port in The At­lantic demon­strated his ac­tual con­tempt for those who serve their coun­try in uni­form.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s foes or­gan­ised con­fer­ence calls, blasted out state­ments, flocked to tele­vi­sion stu­dios and quickly posted ad­ver­tis­ing on­line call­ing at­ten­tion to the re­ported com­ments.</p>
    <p>At a news con­fer­ence, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, grew emo­tional as he said that his son Beau Bi­den, who died of brain can­cer in 2015, “wasn’t a sucker” for serv­ing in the army in Iraq.</p>
    <p>“How would you feel if you had a kid i n Afghanista­n right now?” Mr Bi­den said. “How would you feel if you lost a son, daugh­ter, hus­band, wife? How would you feel, for real?”</p>
    <p>He called the re­ported com­ments</p>
    <p>“dis­gust­ing”, “sick”, “de­plorable”, “un-Amer­i­can” and “ab­so­lutely damnable”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve just never been as dis­ap­pointed in my whole ca­reer with a leader that I’ve worked with, pres­i­dent or oth­er­wise,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump de­nied that he made the re­marks re­peat­edly over the course of the day and ral­lied cur­rent and for­mer aides who backed him up on the record.</p>
    <p>“It’s a fake story and it’s a dis­grace that they’re al­lowed to do it,” he told re­porters in the Oval Of­fice, in­sist­ing that he re­spected the troops. “To me, they’re heroes,” he said. “It’s even hard to be­lieve how they could do it. And I say that, the level of brav­ery, and to me, they’re ab­so­lute heroes.”</p>
    <p>The furore came at a time of ris­ing ten­sion be­tween the com­man­der-in-chief and the mil­i­tary lead­er­ship over his use of troops against pro­test­ers on Amer­i­can streets, his re­fusal to re­name bases named for Con­fed­er­ate gen­er­als, and his clemency for ac­cused and con­victed war crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>A new poll by The Mil­i­tary Times showed Mr Bi­den lead­ing Mr Trump – 41 per cent to 37 per cent – among ac­tive-duty troops, a stark de­par­ture from the mil­i­tary’s long­stand­ing sup­port for Repub­li­cans and a dan­ger sign for the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing that, the Pres­i­dent sought to smooth over fric­tion with</p>
    <p>some in the mil­i­tary by abruptly re­vers­ing course last Fri­day af­ter­noon and an­nounc­ing that his ad­min­is­tra­tion would not be clos­ing Stars and Stripes, the ven­er­a­ble mil­i­tary news­pa­per, by the end of the month af­ter all.</p>
    <p>While cur­rent and for­mer of­fi­cials could not con­firm some of the specifics in The At­lantic’s ac­count, they did ver­ify that Mr Trump re­sisted sup­port­ing an of­fi­cial fu­neral and low­er­ing flags af­ter the death of Se­na­tor John McCain of Ari­zona, a Viet­nam War hero whose mil­i­tary ser­vice he had dis­par­aged.</p>
    <p>And Mr Trump’s as­ser­tion on Fri­day that “I never called John a loser” was be­lied by video and Twit­ter record­ing him do­ing just</p>
    <p>that in 2015.</p>
    <p>More­over, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with Mr Trump’s pri­vate con­ver­sa­tions say he has long scorned those who served in Viet­nam as be­ing too dumb to have got out of it, as he did through a med­i­cal di­ag­no­sis of bone spurs in his heels. At other times, Mr Trump has ex­pressed be­wil­der­ment that peo­ple choose mil­i­tary ser­vice over mak­ing money.</p>
    <p>Some also re­called him ask­ing why the US should be so in­ter­ested in find­ing cap­tured sol­diers, a com­ment made in the con­text of Mr McCain, who was a pris­oner of war in Viet­nam. Another for­mer of­fi­cial said Mr Trump of­ten ex­pressed dis­com­fort around peo­ple who had been in­jured, although he has held events with wounded vet­er­ans.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent pri­vately raged about The At­lantic’s ar­ti­cle and ad­vis­ers pan­icked about how to counter it. They feared it was the be­gin­ning of a con­stant drip of neg­a­tive sto­ries from dis­en­chanted for­mer of­fi­cials that could sway vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial for dam­age was clear by 9.04am, barely 15 hours af­ter the ar­ti­cle was pub­lished, when VoteVets, a lib­eral vet­er­ans or­gan­i­sa­tion that has long been crit­i­cal of Mr Trump, re­leased an on­line ad­ver­tise­ment fea­tur­ing the par­ents of troops slain in Iraq and Afghanista­n, each declar­ing that their son or step­son was not a “loser” or “sucker”.</p>
    <p>The re­port by The At­lantic’s ed­i­tor-in-chief Jef­frey Gold­berg said that Mr Trump de­cided against vis­it­ing a ceme­tery for Amer­i­can sol­diers killed in World War I dur­ing a 2018 visit to France be­cause the rain would have mussed his hair and he did not deem it im­por­tant to hon­our the war dead.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle cited “four peo­ple with first-hand knowl­edge of the dis­cus­sion that day”, but did not name them.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a con­ver­sa­tion with se­nior of­fi­cials that day, ac­cord­ing to the mag­a­zine, Mr Trump said: “Why should I go to that ceme­tery? It’s filled with losers.” On the same trip, the ar­ti­cle said, he re­ferred to Amer­i­can Marines slain in com­bat at Bel­leau Wood as “suck­ers” for get­ting killed.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­cle also said Mr Trump re­sisted hon­our­ing Mr McCain af­ter the se­na­tor’s death in Au­gust 2018. “We’re not go­ing to sup­port that loser’s fu­neral,” the ar­ti­cle quotes Mr Trump telling his staff.</p>
    <p>For the White House, it was a full­court de­fence. “I’ve never heard the Pres­i­dent use the lan­guage that as­sertively is said in that ar­ti­cle about him call­ing mil­i­tary suck­ers and losers,” Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo told Fox News. Even First Lady Me­la­nia Trump weighed in, as­sert­ing that the “story is not true”.</p>
    <p>It’s a fake story and it’s a dis­grace that they’re al­lowed to do it.</p>

    <p>WHAT IF YOUR KID WAS A SOL­DIER?</p>
    <p>How would you feel if you had a kid in Afghanista­n right now?</p>
    <p>MR JOE BI­DEN, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date.</p>
