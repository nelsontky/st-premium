    <p>This was a nice shot in the arm as a morale booster be­cause it came at the height of this Covid-19 moun­tain. There was no ac­cess to restau­rants and to think you can get gourmet food... neatly pack­aged, fresh and hot, that was a nice ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Natalia Tjahja found her­self cook­ing for the first time in her life in April, when the coro­n­avirus struck In­done­sia and her helper had to re­turn to her vil­lage to evade the par­tial lock­down in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>“I had to go to the kitchen to pre­pare food for my­self. I learnt to cook from watch­ing YouTube videos,” she told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>She made her­self some meat­ball spaghetti and was sur­prised it turned out tasty.</p>
    <p>“My food was de­li­cious. I said to my­self, “Wow, I can cook. Why didn’t I try it ear­lier?” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tjahja, who ran a char­ity pro­gramme dis­tribut­ing vi­ta­min sup­ple­ments to med­i­cal work­ers in In­done­sia, then hit upon the idea of making meals for front-line work­ers fight­ing Covid-19 as well as peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>She ap­proached doc­tors and nurses to ask if they would like gifts of meals by chefs and home­cooks.</p>
    <p>“They said they would be so happy as they of­ten skipped meals to tend to pa­tients,” she re­counted.</p>
    <p>Just like that, her non-profit project, Asia Cook­ing Jour­neys, was born.</p>
    <p>In her home coun­try, In­done­sia, 150 pro­fes­sional chefs and am­a­teur cooks have cooked up a storm for about 300 health­care work­ers in var­i­ous cities such as Jakarta, Se­marang, Yo­gyakarta, Ban­dung, Batam and Surabaya.</p>
    <p>She has also tapped her vast in­ter­na­tional net­work and ex­panded the pro­gramme to places such as the United States, Thai­land, Malaysia, Greece, Haiti, South Africa, the Philip­pines, Tai­wan and Sin­ga­pore. Col­lec­tively, they have whipped up and given away about 2,000 meals.</p>
    <p>Her project de­buted in May in Sin­ga­pore and has so far en­listed five chefs and home cooks to serve meals to health­care work­ers and peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties from the Sin­ga­pore Dis­abil­ity Sports Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Ms Tjahja has been ac­tively in­volved in char­i­ta­ble projects with peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties af­ter the death of her seven-year-old daugh­ter, Maria Monique, from a heart at­tack in Sin­ga­pore in 2006.</p>
    <p>In her daugh­ter’s me­mory, Ms Tjahja set up The Maria Monique Last­wish Foun­da­tion in In­done­sia. It ful­fils the last wishes of ter­mi­nally ill chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“God has given me the strength to make this hap­pen, to run this (Asia Cook­ing Jour­neys) pro­gramme. I feel like when I be­lieve in God and I trust God, I walk with mir­a­cles,” said the 50-year-old de­vout Catholic.</p>
    <p>Her lat­est ini­tia­tive is sim­ply to pay trib­ute to med­i­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>Whether it is sal­mon teriyaki, ayam geprek (smashed fried chicken) or what­ever strikes the cook’s fancy, she re­quires only that one meal be pre­pared for just one per­son, and only on week­ends. Not only must the dish be tasty, healthy, well-bal­anced and clean, but it must also look pre­sentable, said Ms Tjahja.</p>
    <p>“Why only one meal? Be­cause I want many peo­ple to join,” she said.</p>
    <p>“But it must be spe­cial, dec­o­rated nicely, maybe with a fruit plat­ter, like a gift. I want the doc­tor or nurse to feel spe­cial and ap­pre­ci­ated. These peo­ple are ready to sac­ri­fice their lives and face Covid-19 pa­tients ev­ery day,” she said.</p>
    <p>One Sin­ga­pore cook who put his la­dle up to be counted is chef Ge­orge Lee. He whipped up lup cheong fried rice, straw­berry salad with bal­samic dress­ing, and dry pea co­conut dessert with fresh dates for two doc­tors.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, you couldn’t go out freely, so I cooked some­thing that was con­ve­nient for me. I cut the lup cheong into small pieces, so the rice and lup cheong can be en­joyed to­gether and smell fra­grant,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I cook from my heart. If I don’t cook from the heart, it won’t taste nice.”</p>
    <p>Chef Lee, 66, who was re­cently laid off from Deutsch­lander, a Ger­man res­tau­rant at Clarke Quay which has closed for good, said he is re­ceiv­ing a govern­ment sup­port grant for re­trenched work­ers.</p>
    <p>But he hopes to find work soon, adding: “I am alert, fully com­mit­ted to cook­ing. I still want to work and maybe open a res­tau­rant. I am look­ing to con­tinue my ca­reer as a chef.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, med­i­cal work­ers who have savoured the home-cooked meals were only too grate­ful.</p>
    <p>One of them is Dr Asok Kurup, who chairs the Academy of Medicine’s Chap­ter of In­fec­tious Dis­ease Physi­cians in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A gourmet spread of grilled chicken biryani, with a side of salad and ke­bab in tangy sauce, pre­pared by Filipino chef Kurt Sombero from Meat­smith Lit­tle In­dia, was a wel­come feast for him and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>At the time, he had been clock­ing 12-hour work days look­ing af­ter in­fected pa­tients in three wards, clad in stuffy per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>He said: “This was a nice shot in the arm as a morale booster be­cause it came at the height of this Covid-19 moun­tain.</p>
    <p>“There was no ac­cess to restau­rants and to think you can get gourmet food and, when it comes to</p>
    <p>DR ASOK KURUP (right), chair­man of the Academy of Medicine’s Chap­ter of In­fec­tious Dis­ease Physi­cians in Sin­ga­pore, on the meal he re­ceived from Asia Cook­ing Jour­neys</p>
    <p>you, it’s neatly pack­aged, fresh and hot, that was a nice ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Dr Kurup said he was so touched by Ms Tjahja’s gen­er­ous ges­ture that he felt com­pelled to pay it for­ward.</p>
    <p>So, he bought and de­liv­ered food to his fel­low col­leagues and nurses as well.</p>
    <p>He had al­ways be­lieved there was “no such thing as a free lunch” un­til he snagged one him­self.</p>
    <p>Dr Kurup hopes the ini­tia­tive will also gen­er­ate pub­lic­ity for the donor chefs and their restau­rants, a pos­i­tive knock-on ef­fect as busi­nesses strug­gle to stay afloat in these try­ing times.</p>
    <p>“If their food is good and if we en­joy it, we also can help to tell oth­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>For Ms Tjahja, she is just happy that her ini­tia­tive has not only filled tum­mies, but also cheered hearts. She is look­ing to launch Asia Cook­ing Jour­neys in South Korea,</p>
    <p>Ja­pan and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>She is grate­ful for the sup­port she has re­ceived from many, in­clud­ing Ms Siti Ma’ri­fah, daugh­ter of In­done­sian Vice-Pres­i­dent Ma’ruf Amin, who helped her launch the ini­tia­tive in Tai­wan, and Mr Nick Bhi­romb­hakdi, Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee of Thai­land chief, who helped her reach out to peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>But de­spite hav­ing con­vinced renowned chefs to cook for a noble cause, she is not con­vinced that her meat­ball spaghetti is up to scratch. She has not served it to any­one else.</p>
    <p>“Ah, I don’t feel con­fi­dent,” she said with a laugh.</p>
    <p>“The med­i­cal work­ers say to me, ‘Please cook for us. It doesn’t mat­ter if it’s nice or not. We will eat it’.</p>
    <p>“I tell them, ‘No, but I will find the best chef for you, the best home cook for you.’”</p>
