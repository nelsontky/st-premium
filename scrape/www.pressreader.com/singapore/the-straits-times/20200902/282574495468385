    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can ac­tress Emma Roberts has fi­nally con­firmed that she is preg­nant.</p>
    <p>Roberts, who is dat­ing ac­tor Gar­rett Hed­lund, posted three pho­tos on In­sta­gram on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old hinted that she is ex­pect­ing a boy with the cap­tion: “Me... and my two favourite guys.”</p>
    <p>In the first photo, she is seen sit­ting and cradling her baby bump, while Hed­lund, 35, is seen with her in the se­cond and third pho­tos.</p>
    <p>Roberts was con­grat­u­lated by sev­eral celebri­ties, in­clud­ing her fa­mous aunt, Os­car-win­ning ac­tress Ju­lia Roberts, who wrote “Love you” with a kiss emoji.</p>
    <p>Glee (2009 to 2015) star Lea Michele, who just gave birth to a baby boy last month and was Emma Roberts’ co-star in tele­vi­sion se­ries Scream Queens (2015 to 2016), wrote: “You will be the great­est mama. I love you Em. Boy moms to­gether.”</p>
    <p>En­ter­tain­ment mag­a­zine Us Weekly first re­ported that Roberts was preg­nant with her first child in June.</p>
    <p>Her mother Kelly Cun­ning­ham seemed to have con­firmed the news then, when she was asked by a ne­ti­zen on In­sta­gram, but her ac­count was later de­ac­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>Roberts, who was in the TV se­ries Amer­i­can Hor­ror Story (2011 to present) and the movie Scream 4 (2011), was linked to Hed­lund in March last year af­ter a sev­enyear on-off re­la­tion­ship with her Amer­i­can Hor­ror Story co-star Evan Peters.</p>
    <p>Hed­lund pre­vi­ously dated ac­tress Kirsten Dunst for four years be­fore they broke up in 2016.</p>
