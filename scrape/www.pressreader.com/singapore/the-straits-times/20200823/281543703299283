    <p>SEOUL • South Korea said yes­ter­day it will roll out tougher so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines to curb the spread of Covid-19 na­tion­wide, as it bat­tles a new out­break of the dis­ease spread­ing from the cap­i­tal Seoul.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (KCDC) re­ported 332 more Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 315 lo­cal in­fec­tions, rais­ing the to­tal caseload to 17,002. The fig­ure marked the largest daily tally since March 8 when the coun­try re­ported 367 new cases.</p>
    <p>Also, all of the coun­try’s 17 ma­jor ci­ties and prov­inces re­ported Covid-19 cases for the first time since the first in­fec­tion was con­firmed on Jan 20, Yon­hap news agency said.</p>
    <p>South Korea, mean­while, re­ported no ad­di­tional deaths, with the to­tal tally at 309. The fa­tal­ity rate was 1.82 per cent.</p>
    <p>South Korea used ad­vanced con­tact trac­ing and wide­spread test­ing to con­tain its first out­break of the coro­n­avirus, but the coun­try has ex­pe­ri­enced per­sis­tent out­breaks in re­cent weeks, mostly in and around densely pop­u­lated Seoul and its sur­round­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>In Seoul and some sur­round­ing ci­ties, the gov­ern­ment has reim­posed sec­ond-tier so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules, in­clud­ing re­strict­ing large gath­er­ings and ban­ning in-per­son church meet­ings while clos­ing night­clubs, karaoke bars, buf­fets and cy­ber cafes.</p>
    <p>The same rules will be im­posed on other ar­eas across the coun­try ef­fec­tive to­day. How­ever, in some ar­eas with fewer in­fec­tions, the guide­lines would be rec­om­mended rather than oblig­a­tory.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t curb the spread (of the virus) in the early stages, this will grow as a large-scale wave. To us, there is noth­ing more im­por­tant than fo­cus­ing on re­spond­ing to Covid-19,” Health Min­is­ter Park Ne­ung-hoo told a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties have cat­e­gorised so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules in three stages – stage 1 be­ing the least in­tense and stage 3 the tough­est, where schools and busi­nesses are urged to close.</p>
    <p>“If we en­hance the so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines to the third stage, it is in­evitable that they will take a toll on peo­ple’s daily lives and the econ­omy. We urge you to take the sit­u­a­tion se­ri­ously,” KCDC deputy di­rec­tor Kwon Jun-wook told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Kwon said South Korea has pro­vided the an­tivi­ral drug remdesivir to treat 143 pa­tients at 35 hospi­tals, but ac­cess to the drug has been ir­reg­u­lar due to is­sues on the sup­plier side.</p>
    <p>In June, South Korea asked drug­maker Gilead Sci­ences to sup­ply enough remdesivir to treat more than 5,000 Covid-19 pa­tients in prepa­ra­tion for a pos­si­ble sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry also said it was post­pon­ing its de­ci­sion to pur­sue poli­cies boost­ing the num­ber of med­i­cal stu­dents un­til the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of South Korean doc­tors have staged strikes and protests over gov­ern­ment plans to train new doc­tors, say­ing there enough doc­tors, but bet­ter con­di­tions and sys­tems are needed to prop­erly al­lo­cate them.</p>
