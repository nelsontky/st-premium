    <p>An In­done­sian do­mes­tic worker who stabbed her em­ployer more than 90 times told the High Court yes­ter­day that she was re­peat­edly raped by her older brother in her teenage years.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati tes­ti­fied that she used to cope by punch­ing the wall in her bed­room to vent her feel­ings.</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ues to be af­fected by the abuse and is re­ceiv­ing psy­chi­atric treat­ment in prison, she said.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian, who said she is two years younger than her of­fi­cial age of 28, was tak­ing the stand for the first time as her mur­der trial re­sumed.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati ini­tially faced the manda­tory death penalty for mur­der, un­der Sec­tion 300(a) of the Pe­nal Code, for re­peat­edly slash­ing and stab­bing Madam Seow Kim Choo, 59, at her Telok Ku­rau house on June 7, 2016.</p>
    <p>In April this year, af­ter 17 days of trial, prose­cu­tors re­duced the charge to mur­der un­der Sec­tion 300(c), which car­ries life im­pris­on­ment or the death sen­tence, but said they were not press­ing for cap­i­tal pun­ish­ment.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati ad­mit­ted to the re­duced charge and was convicted.</p>
    <p>But in a twist last month, she with­drew her guilty plea in the hope of get­ting a lower sen­tence by re­ly­ing on psy­chi­atric ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>She tes­ti­fied yes­ter­day that she wanted to re­turn home less than two months af­ter start­ing work in April 2016 be­cause she was wor­ried about her fam­ily, who could not be con­tacted.</p>
    <p>She said that she felt “very an­gry” with Madam Seow for not al­low­ing her to go home.</p>
    <p>But she main­tained that she had no in­ten­tion to kill her em­ployer and had merely planned to use a knife to frighten Madam Seow into hand­ing over her pass­port.</p>
    <p>“If I had the in­ten­tion to kill her, why would I in­flict so many wounds on her?” she said through an in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati also re­vealed that she has had ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ships with two women.</p>
    <p>Her last girl­friend was a woman she met at a maid train­ing cen­tre in In­done­sia who left to work in Hong Kong shortly be­fore Dary­ati came to work for Madam Seow.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati said she was work­ing overseas not by choice, but be­cause her par­ents had asked her to do so to sup­port the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She said Madam Seow and her hus­band, Mr Ong Thiam Soon, then 57, treated her well and gave her suf­fi­cient food and rest.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she did not have a mo­bile phone to con­tact her fam­ily and her lover or any TV or ra­dio for en­ter­tain­ment. She did not have any day off, and was only al­lowed to leave the house to walk the dogs.</p>
    <p>Weeks af­ter she started work, Dary­ati spoke to her mother on the phone for about 10 minutes but did not get to speak to her lover.</p>
    <p>Dary­ati said she called her fam­ily on two other oc­ca­sions but could not get through. Af­ter each call, she asked Madam Seow to let her go home but was turned down.</p>
    <p>She ac­knowl­edged that she had just started work but said she was wor­ried about her fam­ily. “Fur­ther­more, it is not my wish to work in Sin­ga­pore,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her lawyer Mo­hamed Muza­m­mil Mo­hamed also asked her to ex­plain an en­try in her di­ary, in which she re­solved to carry out her plan quickly.</p>
    <p>The May 12 en­try read: “I have to be brave even though life is at stake. I am ready to face all risks/ con­se­quences, what­ever the risk, I must be ready to ac­cept it. My em­ployer’s fam­ily is my tar­get. DEATH!!!”</p>
    <p>Dary­ati said this meant she was pre­pared to risk death in car­ry­ing out her plan.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
