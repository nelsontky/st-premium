    <p>SHANGHAI • China’s For­eign Min­istry has de­nied claims from an Aus­tralian think-tank that it had de­stroyed thou­sands of mosques in its western Xin­jiang re­gion and said there are over 24,000 mosques there, “more mosques per capita than many Mus­lim coun­tries”.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute (Aspi) had re­leased a re­port on Thurs­day, which es­ti­mated that 16,000 mosques in Xin­jiang have been de­stroyed or dam­aged as a re­sult of gov­ern­ment poli­cies, mostly since 2017.</p>
    <p>The es­ti­mates were made us­ing satel­lite im­agery and based on a sam­ple of 900 re­li­gious sites prior to 2017, in­clud­ing mosques, shrines and sa­cred sites.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has em­barked on a sys­tem­atic and in­ten­tional cam­paign to re­write the cul­tural her­itage of the Xin­jiang Uighur Au­ton­o­mous Re­gion... in or­der to ren­der those indige­nous cul­tural tra­di­tions sub­servient to the ‘Chi­nese na­tion’,” said the Aspi re­port.</p>
    <p>“Along­side other co­er­cive ef­forts to re-en­gi­neer Uighur so­cial and cul­tural life by trans­form­ing or elim­i­nat­ing Uighurs’ lan­guage, mu­sic, homes and even di­ets, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies are ac­tively eras­ing and al­ter­ing key el­e­ments of their tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the re­port, China’s For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang</p>
    <p>Wen­bin called it “noth­ing but slan­der­ous ru­mours” dur­ing a press con­fer­ence on Friday and said the Aspi had re­ceived for­eign funds to “sup­port its con­coc­tion of lies against China”.</p>
    <p>“...there are more than 24,000 mosques in Xin­jiang, which is over 10 times more than in the US. It means there is a mosque for ev­ery 530 Mus­lims in Xin­jiang, which is more mosques per capita than many Mus­lim coun­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has come un­der scru­tiny over its treat­ment of Uighur Mus­lims and claims of forced-labour abuses in Xin­jiang, where the United Na­tions cites cred­i­ble re­ports as say­ing one mil­lion Mus­lims held in camps have been put to work.</p>
    <p>China has de­nied mis­treat­ing Uighurs and said the camps are vo­ca­tional train­ing cen­tres that are needed to tackle ex­trem­ism.</p>
