    <p>BANGKOK • Hun­dreds of high school stu­dents demon­strated in Bangkok yes­ter­day to de­mand re­form of an ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem they say is out­dated, in the lat­est of more than a month of anti-au­thor­ity protests.</p>
    <p>Protests that be­gan on Thai univer­sity cam­puses have taken place al­most daily since mid-July in an in­creas­ing chal­lenge to the govern­ment in the South-east Asian coun­try, with some pro­test­ers also de­mand­ing changes to the pow­er­ful monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Over 600 stu­dents ral­lied out­side the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry in Bangkok. They called for the free­dom to be able to speak their minds at school and the re­lax­ation of rigid rules on uni­forms and be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“Thai ed­u­ca­tion has made us pup­pets,” said 18-year-old Supicha</p>
    <p>“Menu” Chailom. “We are not ro­bots of the sys­tem; we are the youth and have the right to ex­press our­selves.”</p>
    <p>Protests spread to some high schools last month, with stu­dents rais­ing The Hunger Games movie tril­ogy’s three-fin­ger salute dur­ing morn­ing as­sem­blies, a sym­bol of the pro-democ­racy move­ment.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Nat­aphol Teep­suwan told re­porters that he re­spected stu­dents’ rights.</p>
    <p>“The is­sues that the youth raised are things we can come to an un­der­stand­ing on as long as we re­spect each other and the rules,” he said.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha, the main tar­get of the protests, last week warned pro­test­ers they were cre­at­ing di­vi­sions that could cause the col­lapse of Thai­land and leave it “en­gulfed in flames”.</p>
    <p>He has par­tic­u­larly con­demned those who have de­manded re­forms to the monar­chy – once a ta­boo sub­ject.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s govern­ment yes­ter­day re­leased a car­toon drawn by King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, who spends most of his time in Europe,</p>
    <p>that por­trayed a happy Thai fam­ily liv­ing a con­tented ru­ral life.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, pro­test­ers tied white rib­bons to the gate of a prison in</p>
    <p>Bangkok on Fri­day to call for the re­lease of two ac­tivists whose bail was re­voked as they face charges over anti-govern­ment demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>Rights lawyer Anon Nampa, 36, and stu­dent ac­tivist Panupong “Mike” Jad­nok, 24, were sent to the Bangkok Re­mand Prison on Thurs­day af­ter the court said po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties since their Aug 8 re­lease breached their bail con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Around 100 pro­test­ers gath­ered at the prison.</p>
    <p>“We are ty­ing white rib­bons to de­mand jus­tice for our friends who face po­lit­i­cal pros­e­cu­tion,” said Ms Pat­sar­avalee Tanakitvib­ulpon, leader of the Free Peo­ple Move­ment. “Not just Anon and Mike, but there are oth­ers who face in­jus­tice and there are many who are be­ing charged just for speak­ing the truth.”</p>
    <p>Anon and Panupong are among more than a dozen demon­stra­tors charged re­cently with in­cit­ing un­rest and breach­ing reg­u­la­tions that ban pub­lic gath­er­ings, af­ter they took part in a rally on July 18.</p>
    <p>Anon also made a ta­boo-break­ing speech on Aug 3 in which he called for re­forms to the pow­er­ful monar­chy. He faces ad­di­tional charges over that protest.</p>
