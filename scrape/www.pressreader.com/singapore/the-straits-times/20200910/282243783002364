    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will be step­ping up su­per­vi­sory en­gage­ment to en­sure that banks in the Repub­lic are well pre­pared to tran­si­tion to a new in­ter­est rate bench­mark by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in the midst of its move from Swap Of­fer Rate (SOR) to the Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora). This comes on the back of the dis­con­tin­u­a­tion of the Lon­don In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Li­bor) at end-2021, which would af­fect SOR as it uses the US-dol­lar Li­bor in its com­pu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Jacqueline Loh, MAS’ deputy man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for mar­kets and de­vel­op­ment, said yes­ter­day that banks which do not keep pace with in­dus­try tran­si­tion time­lines po­ten­tially ex­pose them­selves to ad­di­tional mar­ket, liq­uid­ity, op­er­a­tional, tech­nol­ogy and le­gal risks.</p>
    <p>The banks can also ex­pect to have more “in­ten­sive su­per­vi­sory en­gage­ment” at the se­nior man­age­ment level, she added.</p>
    <p>She was speak­ing at the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore’s vir­tual roundtable ses­sion on Sin­ga­pore dol­lar (SGD) in­ter­est rate land­scape changes, at­tended by over 1,500 par­tic­i­pants from the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try, busi­nesses and the me­dia.</p>
    <p>SOR is used in the pric­ing of bonds and loans to large in­sti­tu­tions with hedg­ing re­quire­ments, as it is also the ref­er­ence bench­mark in SGD de­riv­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Sora was se­lected as the new in­ter­est rate bench­mark as it was found to be the “most ro­bust and suit­able al­ter­na­tive”, un­der­pinned by a deep and liq­uid overnight fund­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ms Loh flagged that the tran­si­tion of legacy con­tracts will be a key part of the work of the in­dus­try-led steer­ing com­mit­tee on SOR tran­si­tion to Sora in the re­main­ing months.</p>
    <p>Close to $1.4 tril­lion no­tional value of out­stand­ing SGD de­riv­a­tives con­tracts ref­er­enc­ing SOR, and around 12,000 SOR con­tracts in SGD cash mar­kets amount­ing to $95 bil­lion, will ma­ture af­ter end-2021 and will need to tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus­ing on a smooth tran­si­tion is a key pil­lar, but the main chal­lenge is to en­cour­age mar­ket par­tic­i­pants to shift from a SOR-based mar­ket that is still deep and liq­uid, to the nascent but de­vel­op­ing Sorabased mar­ket, she said.</p>
    <p>To do so, MAS will ex­pand its in­au­gu­ral $500 mil­lion Sora float­in­grate notes is­suance fol­low­ing the “strong mar­ket re­sponse”, through in­creas­ing the is­suance sizes and length­en­ing the range of tenors. More de­tails will be an­nounced later this year.</p>
    <p>Guid­ance on dead­lines to cease the usage of SOR in new fi­nan­cial prod­ucts will also be out­lined by MAS and the steer­ing com­mit­tee next month.</p>
    <p>Pre­par­ing early at the in­di­vid­u­al­firm level is an­other key pil­lar she listed for a smooth tran­si­tion. This in­cludes iden­ti­fy­ing risk ex­po­sures, putting in place ap­pro­pri­ate con­trac­tual fall­backs, en­sur­ing sys­tems’ readi­ness, un­der­stand­ing the fea­tures of new Sora prod­ucts and, ul­ti­mately, trans­act­ing in these prod­ucts, Ms Loh said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral such loans are al­ready in the mar­ket, such as the three lo­cal banks com­plet­ing Sora com­mer­cial loans with early adopters like Cap­i­ta­Land and Wil­mar.</p>
    <p>“Rid­ing on these suc­cess­ful pi­lots, we hope to see more banks start orig­i­nat­ing new Sora loans across the broader in­dus­try,” she said.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween banks and cus­tomers is key for a smooth tran­si­tion, she added, not­ing that MAS ex­pects lenders to en­gage cus­tomers in a clear, timely and trans­par­ent man­ner.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is now at a “crit­i­cal junc­ture” in its in­ter­est rate bench­mark re­form, Ms Loh noted.</p>
    <p>“The sooner we take steps to front-load this change man­age­ment process, the more likely we can cre­ate a vir­tu­ous cy­cle, which fa­cil­i­tates a smooth tran­si­tion to Sora,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Con­versely, if we de­lay the shift un­til it is too late, this would have im­pli­ca­tions on fu­ture mar­ket ef­fi­ciency and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity at the in­dus­try level, and higher risks at the in­di­vid­ual-firm level.”</p>
    <p>THE SOONER THE BET­TER</p>
    <p>The sooner we take steps to front-load this change man­age­ment process, the more likely we can cre­ate a vir­tu­ous cy­cle, which fa­cil­i­tates a smooth tran­si­tion to Sora.</p>
    <p>MS JACQUELINE LOH, MAS’ deputy man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for mar­kets and de­vel­op­ment, re­fer­ring to the tran­si­tion to Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age.</p>
