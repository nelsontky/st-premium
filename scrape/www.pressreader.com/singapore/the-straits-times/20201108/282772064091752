    <p>Guardi­ola’s City are sus­cep­ti­ble to speed in an­other as­pect: They have a men­tal is­sue where they can con­cede in quick suc­ces­sion against in­ci­sive, am­bi­tious op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>There are three man­agers on three. There is Jose Mour­inho on six. And then there is Jur­gen Klopp, out on his own with nine, with three times as many vic­to­ries against Pep Guardi­ola as any­one ex­cept Mour­inho, who has a los­ing record.</p>
    <p>It ex­plains why, long be­fore Liver­pool de­throned Manch­ester City as Pre­mier League cham­pi­ons, Klopp had a rep­u­ta­tion as Guardi­ola’s neme­sis. The Ger­man won the bat­tles, even when the Cata­lan won the wars as he ac­cu­mu­lated four league ti­tles in di­vi­sions fea­tur­ing Klopp’s teams.</p>
    <p>As ri­val­ries are re­newed to­day, it is a friendly feud, a mu­tual ad­mi­ra­tion so­ci­ety but where a shared sense of re­spect should not ob­scure fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola can tin­ker with his tac­tics or team se­lec­tion against Klopp.</p>
    <p>The Reds man­ager does not com­pro­mise. He be­lieves in his way. Klopp is bold enough to at­tack Guardi­ola, to com­mit men up­field and to play a high de­fen­sive line. When a high-risk strat­egy goes wrong, he has suf­fered 5-0 and 4-0 de­feats. But when it goes right and his sides com­press the space be­tween the lines to snuff out Guardi­ola’s at­tack­ing mid­field­ers, Klopp usu­ally pros­pers.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola has spent years try­ing to for­mu­late an an­swer to idio­syn­cratic tac­tics. “There is not an­other team in the world at­tack­ing this way with so many play­ers... in­side,” he said in 2016.</p>
    <p>The nar­row­ness of Liver­pool’s front three and mid­field presents a prob­lem for a man­ager who wants to make the game wider.</p>
    <p>So does Liver­pool’s pace on the counter, Klopp’s beloved tran­si­tions mean­ing City are of­ten caught with play­ers ahead of the ball when the Ger­man’s teams break. Guardi­ola’s City are sus­cep­ti­ble to speed in an­other as­pect: They have a men­tal is­sue where they can con­cede in quick suc­ces­sion against in­ci­sive, am­bi­tious op­po­nents. Liver­pool have scored three goals in nine and 19 min­utes against City. Last sea­son, they got two in seven min­utes at An­field.</p>
    <p>Whereas Klopp re­tains his blue­print, the the­o­rist in Guardi­ola has ex­per­i­mented. At Bay­ern Mu­nich, he came to favour a back three against Klopp’s Dortmund, but they played 4-2-3-1. Liver­pool play 4-3-3. Re­cently Guardi­ola has tried 4-2-3-1, which he used in both league meet­ings last sea­son, giv­ing the added se­cu­rity of a sec­ond hold­ing mid­fielder, partly to help po­lice Roberto Firmino when he drops deeper.</p>
    <p>But other strate­gies have back­fired, lead­ing to fa­mil­iar ac­cu­sa­tions that, by over­think­ing things, Guardi­ola has sac­ri­ficed his side’s strengths. Seek­ing an ex­tra mid­fielder to com­bat Liver­pool in the con­gested cen­tre at An­field in the 2018 Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter-fi­nal, he picked Ilkay Gun­do­gan in a hy­brid role, nei­ther quite on the right nor in the mid­dle and mean­ing Raheem Ster­ling was only a sub­sti­tute. It back­fired.</p>
    <p>Seek­ing an an­swer to Liver­pool’s nar­row front three, he chose Aymeric La­porte at left-back then. He lost 3-0. In the re­turn leg, he played 3-1-3-3, a shape with­out width, but which risked leav­ing three de­fend­ers against Liver­pool’s feared for­ward trio. He lost 2-1.</p>
    <p>A new plan was needed. With 4-2-3-1, he has drawn, lost and won. But his search for a truly win­ning for­mula has gone on. It may in­volve some­thing un­ortho­dox to­day.</p>
