    <p>• Ger­man doc­tors have been al­lowed ac­cess to hos­pi­talised Rus­sian op­po­si­tion fig­ure Alexei Navalny, rais­ing the hope that the au­thor­i­ties might al­low him to be trans­ferred to Ger­many for treat­ment soon, his chief of staff said.</p>
    <p>Mr Leonid Volkov, Mr Navalny’s right-hand man, said what he de­scribed as a sud­den, un­ex­pected de­ci­sion by doc­tors in Omsk not to re­lease Mr Navalny to a wait­ing air am­bu­lance, was a cover-up to pre­vent the world from find­ing out what hap­pened to him.</p>
    <p>“What... in­flu­enced this young and sporty man to this ex­tent that he was nearly dead and had to be put in coma and on a ven­ti­la­tor... is still un­clear,” Mr Volkov said.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny’s al­lies sus­pect he was poi­soned be­fore board­ing a flight to Moscow and have sug­gested that it will not be pos­si­ble to trace the poi­son if too much time passes be­fore tests are per­formed.</p>
    <p>Mr Volkov said doc­tors had changed their minds about let­ting Mr Navalny fly af­ter se­cu­rity of­fi­cials took over the de­ci­sion-mak­ing process from the physi­cians.</p>
    <p>Mr Jaka Bizilj, founder of the Cin­ema for Peace Foun­da­tion that sent the air­craft to Omsk in Siberia, said the de­ci­sion came as a sur­prise as the Rus­sian au­thor­i­ties had granted per­mis­sion for the flight.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion had in 2018 taken ac­tivist Py­otr Verzilov, a mem­ber of the dis­si­dent art col­lec­tive Pussy Riot, to Ber­lin for treat­ment. Doc­tors con­cluded that he was poi­soned but it was too late at that stage to iden­tify the agent.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny’s wife Yu­lia yes­ter­day ap­pealed to Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin to al­low him to be flown to Ger­many for ur­gent med­i­cal care. “I of­fi­cially ap­peal to you (Putin) to de­mand you al­low the trans­porta­tion of... Navalny to... Ger­many,” read the let­ter that Mrs Navalny sent to the Krem­lin. It was pub­lished on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny’s aides have asked a Europe rights court to ob­tain his med­i­cal trans­fer to Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Dr Alexan­der Mu­rakhovsky, the head doc­tor at the hos­pi­tal in Omsk, said traces of in­dus­trial chem­i­cal sub­stances had been found on Mr Navalny’s clothes and fin­gers. He said the 44-year-old would re­main at the hos­pi­tal un­til his con­di­tion sta­bilised.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny’s wife and his spokesman Kira Yarmysh have crit­i­cised the hos­pi­tal af­ter it said that mov­ing him would put his life at risk be­cause he was still in a coma and his con­di­tion un­sta­ble.</p>
    <p>“The ban on trans­port­ing Navalny is an at­tempt on his life be­ing car­ried out right now by doc­tors and the de­ceit­ful au­thor­i­ties,” Ms Yarmysh wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing be­fore the let­ter was sent, the Krem­lin yes­ter­day said it was up to doc­tors to de­cide whether Mr Navalny was fit to be moved from the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Dr Mu­rakhovsky told re­porters that many le­gal ques­tions would need to be re­solved be­fore Mr Navalny could be handed over to Euro­pean doc­tors.</p>
    <p>He said the top doc­tors who had been flown in from Moscow to treat Mr Navalny were no worse than their Euro­pean coun­ter­parts. Test re­sults would be avail­able within two days, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny fell ill af­ter drink­ing tea on Thurs­day morn­ing that his al­lies be­lieve was laced with poi­son. He started feel­ing un­well while on a flight and was rushed to hos­pi­tal af­ter the plane made an emer­gency land­ing in Omsk.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny has been the big­gest thorn in the Krem­lin’s side for more than a decade, ex­pos­ing what he says is high-level graft and mo­bil­is­ing crowds of pro­test­ers. He was barred from run­ning in a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in 2018.</p>
    <p>French Ju­nior Euro­pean Af­fairs Min­is­ter Cle­ment Beaune yes­ter­day said he shared the con­cerns and fears about Mr Navalny’s fate, and re­it­er­ated that France was ready to help him if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian of­fi­cials have re­fused Euro­pean re­quests that op­po­si­tion leader Alexei Navalny – now in a coma fight­ing for his life af­ter be­ing al­legedly poi­soned – be flown to Ger­many for spe­cial­ist treat­ment.</p>
    <p>A number of Euro­pean lead­ers, in­clud­ing Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel, have of­fered to pro­vide Mr Navalny with spe­cial­ist detox­i­fi­ca­tion treat­ment, and a Ger­man non-govern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tion has dis­patched an am­bu­lance jet to take the Rus­sian op­po­si­tion leader to the fa­mous Charite hos­pi­tal in Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>The as­sump­tion among Euro­pean gov­ern­ments is that ul­ti­mately, Rus­sia will re­lent and al­low Mr Navalny’s evac­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But the pre­var­i­ca­tion sur­round­ing his con­di­tion and the ap­par­ent at­tack on him re­call the murky fate of many other Rus­sian jour­nal­ists or politi­cians whose lives have been cur­tailed in mys­te­ri­ous cir­cum­stances af­ter they op­posed the govern­ment of Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, a prom­i­nent critic of Mr Putin, was re­turn­ing to Moscow by plane from Siberia on Thurs­day when he fell ill, prompt­ing the pi­lot to make an emer­gency land­ing in Omsk – a city more than 2,000km from the Rus­sian cap­i­tal – where he re­mains in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Dr Alexan­der Mu­rakhovsky, the head medic at the hos­pi­tal treat­ing him, has claimed that “no poi­son has been de­tected” in Mr Navalny’s body, blam­ing his con­di­tion on al­legedly low sugar lev­els.</p>
    <p>Cu­ri­ously, how­ever, the hos­pi­tal has banned any out­side med­i­cal con­sul­tants and claims that Mr Navalny’s con­di­tion is “still too un­sta­ble” to al­low him to be flown to Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, 44, came to national promi­nence in De­cem­ber 2011 when Rus­sia ex­pe­ri­enced the big­gest wave of anti-govern­ment demon­stra­tions since the col­lapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>His role in those demon­stra­tions led to his first jail sen­tence – for “re­sist­ing law en­force­ment of­fi­cers” – fol­lowed by many other ar­rests on a va­ri­ety of charges.</p>
    <p>In 2013, he re­ceived a long sen­tence for al­leged em­bez­zle­ment, an ac­cu­sa­tion he dis­missed as po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties ul­ti­mately bowed to pub­lic pres­sure, and the sen­tence was never en­forced.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Navalny has suf­fered at least two se­ri­ous phys­i­cal at­tacks.</p>
    <p>The first hap­pened in 2017, when un­known in­di­vid­u­als in­flicted burns on his eyes by splash­ing him with chem­i­cally treated ink.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond oc­curred last year while he was in po­lice cus­tody. He was rushed to hos­pi­tal for what he</p>
