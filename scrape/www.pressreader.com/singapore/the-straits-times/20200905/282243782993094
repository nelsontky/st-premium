    <p>A po­lice sergeant who com­mit­ted a string of of­fences, in­clud­ing mis­chief and mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing items from his work­place, was sen­tenced to six months’ jail yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Joel Lim Jian Da, now 28, who was at­tached to the Tampines Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Cen­tre (NPC) but has since been sus­pended, had also taken home 64 con­fi­den­tial doc­u­ments be­long­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force, even though he had no right to re­tain them.</p>
    <p>De­tails about these doc­u­ments were not re­vealed in a district court.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean also took his col­league’s work equip­ment, a Cu­bi­con 2 Mo­bile Data Ter­mi­nal Mo­torola ES400 worth $1,368, and threw it away.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Genevieve Pang said: “The ES400 set is a mo­bile data ter­mi­nal used by the po­lice to re­lay ‘live’ in­for­ma­tion of on­go­ing op­er­a­tions and in­ves­ti­ga­tions from of­fi­cers to the op­er­a­tions room and vice versa, to dis­patch ground of­fi­cers or call for backup, and to re­ceive up­dates about the ground op­er­a­tions from the said of­fi­cers.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Lim pleaded guilty to two counts of dis­hon­est mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of prop­erty as well as one count each of mis­chief and giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to a pub­lic ser­vant.</p>
    <p>Seven other charges, in­clud­ing an of­fence un­der the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act in­volv­ing the con­fi­den­tial doc­u­ments, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>It is not known why Lim com­mit­ted these of­fences, but de­fence lawyer Anand Nalachan­dran said that they were not for his client’s per­sonal gain.</p>
    <p>At around 4.30am on Oct 17, 2015, Lim en­tered a po­lice ve­hi­cle parked near the NPC and spot­ted a po­lice­woman’s ES400 set in­side.</p>
    <p>He took the de­vice even though it did not be­long to him. The po­lice­woman re­turned about 20 min­utes later and con­ducted a search af­ter she found it miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Lim then tried to cover up his un­law­ful act by join­ing in the search. He said that he threw the de­vice into a dust­bin later.</p>
    <p>Later that day, Lim gave false in­for­ma­tion to an­other po­lice of­fi­cer claim­ing that he had not seen the ES400 set.</p>
    <p>Lim came clean about what he had done only on Sept 21, 2016. He has since made full resti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>When of­fi­cers searched his flat later that day, they found items in­clud­ing the 64 con­fi­den­tial doc­u­ments, two stu­dents’ ez-link cards and an NRIC that had ear­lier been handed to him while he was on counter duty at the NPC in 2015.</p>
    <p>The court heard that in­stead of mak­ing a found­prop­erty re­port as he was sup­posed to, Lim took the NRIC home and kept it there un­til it was seized on Sept 21, 2016.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Lim pleaded guilty to two counts of dis­hon­est mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of prop­erty as well as one count each of mis­chief and giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to a pub­lic ser­vant. Seven other charges, in­clud­ing an of­fence un­der the Of­fi­cial Se­crets Act in­volv­ing the con­fi­den­tial doc­u­ments, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
