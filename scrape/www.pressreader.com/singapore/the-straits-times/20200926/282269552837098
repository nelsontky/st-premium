    <p>HONG KONG • China Ever­grande Group is fac­ing a cri­sis of con­fi­dence among cred­i­tors who lent the world’s most-in­debted de­vel­oper more than US$120 bil­lion (S$165 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Long-sim­mer­ing doubts about the health of China’s big­gest prop­erty com­pany by rev­enue ex­ploded to the fore on Thurs­day, fol­low­ing re­ports it had warned lo­cal gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials of a po­ten­tial cash crunch that could threaten China’s fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In­vestors dumped Ever­grande’s bonds yes­ter­day, send­ing its yuan note due in 2023 down as much as 28 per cent to a record low. The com­pany’s Hong Kong-listed shares sank as much as 8.8 per cent to a near five-month low.</p>
    <p>Sub­sidiaries Ever­grande New En­ergy Ve­hi­cle Group and HengTen Net­works Group tum­bled 14 per cent and 20 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande said in a state­ment that ru­mours and doc­u­ments cir­cu­lat­ing on­line were “fab­ri­cated” and “pure defama­tion”, with­out com­ment­ing di­rectly on whether it had warned of­fi­cials of a po­ten­tial cash crunch.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­oper, con­trolled by bil­lion­aire Hui Ka Yan, said it gen­er­ated 400 bil­lion yuan (S$81 bil­lion) from project sales in the first eight months of the year and main­tains healthy op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande won ap­proval from Hong Kong’s stock ex­change to spin off its prop­erty man­age­ment unit, a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said yes­ter­day. This paves the way for it to raise ad­di­tional cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Wor­ries that Ever­grande may still face a liq­uid­ity short­fall stem from an agree­ment with some of its big­gest strate­gic in­vestors.</p>
    <p>It gives them the right to de­mand their money back if the com­pany fails to win ap­proval for a back­door list­ing on the Shen­zhen Stock Ex­change by Jan 31 next year. The re­pay­ment could amount to 130 bil­lion yuan, or about 92 per cent of Ever­grande’s cash and cash equiv­a­lents.</p>
    <p>At least one of the in­vestors has sig­nalled it would be un­will­ing to ex­tend the dead­line.</p>
    <p>In an­other sign that cred­i­tors are grow­ing in­creas­ingly con­cerned, at least five Chi­nese banks and two trust firms held emer­gency meet­ings on Thurs­day night to dis­cuss their Ever­grande ex­po­sure and ac­cess to col­lat­eral, sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>At least two of the banks that con­vened meet­ings de­cided to bar Ever­grande from draw­ing un­used credit lines, ac­cord­ing to the sources. The de­vel­oper had credit lines of 503 bil­lion yuan as at June 30, of which 302 bil­lion yuan was un­used.</p>
    <p>“We think the sit­u­a­tion may have pro­longed neg­a­tive im­pact,” credit an­a­lysts Man­jesh Verma and Stella Li of Cit­i­group wrote in a re­port. “It in­creases con­cerns among var­i­ous in­vestors and lenders and hence in­creases dif­fi­culty in fund­ing ac­cess and re­fi­nanc­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ever­grande has long been viewed as a poster child for highly lever­aged com­pa­nies in China, where cor­po­rate debt swelled to a record 205 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct last year and has most likely climbed fur­ther this year, as busi­nesses in­creased bor­row­ing to tide them­selves over dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ever­grande has tapped banks, shadow lenders and the bond mar­ket in re­cent years to ex­pand far be­yond the prop­erty in­dus­try into busi­nesses rang­ing from elec­tric cars to hos­pi­tals to theme parks – ar­eas that of­ten align with Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s pol­icy pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Though it is un­clear why Ever­grande has yet to win ap­proval for its list­ing plan, some an­a­lysts have spec­u­lated it may re­late to China’s ef­forts to tame sky-high home prices and re­strain fund rais­ing by de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors have since 2016 been us­ing a wide range of pol­icy levers to ban spec­u­la­tive home buy­ers, curb ex­pen­sive land prices and restrict lend­ing to res­i­den­tial builders.</p>
    <p>An­other unan­swered ques­tion sur­round­ing Ever­grande is whether China’s gov­ern­ment would step in to sup­port the de­vel­oper if it strug­gles to re­pay cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>While pol­i­cy­mak­ers have a long his­tory of pro­vid­ing back­stops for sys­tem­i­cally im­por­tant com­pa­nies to main­tain fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity, the gov­ern­ment has in re­cent years sought to in­stil more mar­ket dis­ci­pline and re­duce moral haz­ard.</p>
    <p>As part of those ef­forts to rein in risk in the coun­try’s US$45 tril­lion fi­nan­cial sys­tem, the au­thor­i­ties have taken con­trol of in­debted con­glom­er­ates, in­clud­ing HNA Group, An­bang In­sur­ance Group and To­mor­row Group.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers have also in­tro­duced new rules for fi­nan­cial hold­ing com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Ever­grande, that im­pose min­i­mum cap­i­tal re­quire­ments and other re­stric­tions meant to re­duce sys­temic risk.</p>
