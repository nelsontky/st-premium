    <p>Why are cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) prices trend­ing at such high lev­els when the coun­try is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a re­ces­sion? The short an­swer is that COE prices are in­flu­enced by sup­ply and de­mand. The longer an­swer, how­ever, in­volves look­ing at how much bear­ing ex­ter­nal fac­tors have had on COE prices over the years.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in the midst of a pan­demic-in­duced eco­nomic slump, so why are cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) prices still so high?</p>
    <p>That has been a com­mon re­frain in cof­fee shops and on­line fo­rums alike, as car COE pre­mi­ums hover at their high­est lev­els this year – with no im­me­di­ate signs of a slide.</p>
    <p>At the lat­est ten­der on Oct 21, the COE price for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp – which ac­counts for the bulk of car cer­tifi­cates – closed at $37,334, more than $5,000 higher than their $32,309 pre­mium at the same time last year.</p>
    <p>Why are COE prices trend­ing at such lev­els when the coun­try is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing its deep­est re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence, and the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate is at 4.5 per cent, its high­est since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008?</p>
    <p>The short an­swer is that COE prices, like most things, are in­flu­enced by sup­ply and de­mand.</p>
    <p>The sup­ply of cer­tifi­cates is de­ter­mined largely by the num­ber of ve­hi­cles be­ing scrapped, which fol­lows a 10-year cy­cle (as each COE is valid for 10 years). And the sup­ply this year is at its low­est in five years.</p>
    <p>The longer an­swer in­volves look­ing at how much bear­ing ex­ter­nal fac­tors have had on COE prices over the years.</p>
    <p>To do this, The Straits Times plot­ted a chart show­ing the sup­ply and av­er­age price of Cat­e­gory A COE (for cars up to 1,600cc) from 1999, the year car COE cat­e­gories were re­duced from four to two.</p>
    <p>The 22-year chart in­cludes ma­jor global and lo­cal events.</p>
    <p>Coin­ci­den­tally, this year’s sup­ply is al­most iden­ti­cal to 1999’s. But the av­er­age Cat A price is 20 per cent lower than what it was in</p>
    <p>1999, when Sin­ga­pore re­bounded from the 1997-98 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>This is one ex­am­ple of an ex­ter­nal fac­tor ex­ert­ing an in­flu­ence on COE prices, but the in­flu­ence is not al­ways dra­matic, as there are other un­der­ly­ing fac­tors at play. In the case of 1999 ver­sus this year, we have to take into ac­count, for in­stance, a 50 per cent pop­u­la­tion growth, off­set by a 60 per cent in­crease in public trans­port us­age.</p>
    <p>In­deed, COE prices have moved gen­er­ally in the op­po­site di­rec­tion of quota sizes. Mean­ing, the smaller the quota, the higher the prices; and the larger the quota, the lower the prices. But some­thing strange hap­pened be­tween 2015 and this year, when a down­ward sup­ply trend was met with a down­ward price trend.</p>
    <p>Mr Ron Lim, sales and mar­ket­ing head at Nis­san agent Tan Chong Mo­tor, said two new fac­tors have di­min­ished the in­flu­ence that sup­ply had on prices.</p>
    <p>One is the in­creased pop­u­lar­ity of COE reval­i­da­tion, where mo­torists pay a pre­vail­ing quota pre­mium to ex­tend the va­lid­ity of their car’s COE be­yond 10 years.</p>
    <p>“Prior to 2015, COE ex­ten­sions were al­most un­heard of,” Mr Lim said, adding that the new trend has in­evitably cre­ated a price ceil­ing for COEs “as driv­ers now have a vi­able and ac­cept­able op­tion of sim­ply ex­tend­ing the life of their ve­hi­cles if they feel COE prices are too high”.</p>
    <p>In 2015, nearly 10,000 car COEs were reval­i­dated – 10 times the av­er­age of the pre­ced­ing five years.</p>
    <p>The se­cond fac­tor was the ar­rival of pri­vate-hire op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Although Uber and Grab started op­er­a­tions here in 2013, they started build­ing up their own fleets later. But once they started, the two (es­pe­cially Uber) ex­panded ag­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the num­ber of chauf­feured pri­vate-hire cars hit 10,485 – up from just 1,609 in 2014 and 614 in 2013. By the end of last year, the fig­ure had soared to 55,575.</p>
    <p>This, Mr Lim noted, cre­ated a “price floor”. So, pre­mi­ums did not fall as much as in the pre­vi­ous pe­riod, when quo­tas were sim­i­lar to what they have been in the last five years.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) depart­ment of an­a­lyt­ics and op­er­a­tions’ as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Chu Sing­fat said the in­flu­ence that sup­ply has on COE prices starts to di­min­ish once the quota falls be­low a cer­tain thresh­old.</p>
    <p>For Cat A, he said the thresh­old was around 800 cer­tifi­cates per ten­der. From 2010 to 2014, the quo­tas were be­low this thresh­old.</p>
    <p>When this hap­pens, Prof Chu said, “bid­ding be­comes emo­tional rather than ra­tio­nal”, mean­ing bid­ders tend to bid higher than they would nor­mally.</p>
    <p>This was ob­served in 2013, which had the small­est quota on record. That year, Cat A pre­mium soared to al­most $80,000, while the Cat B price (for cars above 1,600cc) hov­ered just be­low $100,000.</p>
    <p>CAR LOAN CURBS</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary of Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore quickly stepped in to rein­tro­duce a curb on car loans, which im­me­di­ately brought pre­mi­ums back to earth.</p>
    <p>In fact, av­er­age pre­mi­ums have been head­ing south con­tin­u­ously since 2014, and be­gan to creep up only this year.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor in­dus­try watch­ers said the buoy­ant prices in re­cent months were largely the re­sult of pent-up de­mand, built up dur­ing a three-month bid­ding sus­pen­sion from April to June – when the coun­try went into a cir­cuit breaker mode to pre­vent Covid-19 from spread­ing.</p>
    <p>From July – when bid­ding re­sumed – to Septem­ber, Cat A prices have been av­er­ag­ing $35,200 – up 7 per cent from $32,900 in the Jan­uary-March pe­riod.</p>
    <p>This blip is what Nanyang Busi­ness School’s ad­junct as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Za­far Momin might term as an “eco­nomic shock”.</p>
    <p>Us­ing re­gres­sion anal­y­sis (a sta­tis­ti­cal tool), Prof Momin, a for­mer au­to­mo­tive ex­pert at Bos­ton Con­sult­ing, found that the cor­re­la­tion be­tween COE sup­ply and COE price was “ex­cel­lent” from 1999 to 2008, when “one could pre­dict COE pre­mi­ums quite ac­cu­rately just by us­ing monthly quota data”.</p>
    <p>But, from 2009 to this year, COE sup­ply be­came “less sig­nif­i­cant as a fac­tor in­flu­enc­ing COE prices”. And this be­came even more ap­par­ent from 2014.</p>
    <p>Prof Momin at­tributes this to “eco­nomic shocks” – un­ex­pected events, as op­posed to quota sizes, which are largely cycli­cal in na­ture and there­fore some­what pre­dictable. He noted there have been more “eco­nomic shocks” in the last decade (2009-20) than in the pre­ced­ing decade.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, sup­ply quo­tas will re­main im­por­tant in­flu­encers of COE prices,” Prof Momin said, but added that “ex­ter­nal shocks and mar­ket trends” can­not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>“Since many of th­ese ex­ter­nal shocks and mar­ket trends are not an­tic­i­pated... it is dif­fi­cult to pre­dict how they will in­flu­ence the mar­ket or COE prices go­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>To pre­vent sup­ply shocks, Prof Chu pro­posed smoothen­ing the an­nual quo­tas by “bank­ing in” dur­ing times of plenty and re­leas­ing the saved cer­tifi­cates dur­ing lean times.</p>
    <p>“I think this is em­i­nently fea­si­ble,” he said. “It is very sim­i­lar to the ac­tive man­age­ment of, say, the value of the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar.”</p>
    <p>The need to do so, how­ever, may have since been over­taken by events. With the pre­vail­ing trend of peo­ple hold­ing on to their cars be­yond 10 years, the peak-and-trough COE sup­ply curve will be flat­ter in fu­ture cy­cles.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the vast ma­jor­ity of those who reval­i­dated their car COEs be­tween 2015 and 2018 did so for five years (in­stead of 10, be­cause it in­volved a smaller out­lay). Th­ese cars with five-year ex­ten­sions will be scrapped from this year – adding thou­sands of “ex­tra” COEs from the usual 10-year re­place­ment cy­cle.</p>
    <p>This should off­set a fore­see­able sup­ply shrink­age aris­ing from the same COE re­newal trend. From 2013 to 2017, about one-third of new cars qual­i­fied for a gen­er­ous car­bon re­bate.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of this re­bate, their scrap re­bates – for­feited upon</p>
    <p>COE ex­ten­sion – are also smaller. Hence, many own­ers will find it rel­a­tively pain­less to hold on to such cars.</p>
    <p>In any case, as Prof Momin and Mr Lim have noted, sup­ply now seems to have a less sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on price than be­fore.</p>
    <p>NUS trans­port re­searcher Lee Der-Horng agrees.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee said fu­ture COE price trends may be al­tered by a fun­da­men­tal shift in car own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, I would ex­pect that the public’s at­ti­tude towards car own­er­ship will be­come more ra­tio­nal,” he said. “Ul­ti­mately, the car is a tool, and there ex­ists many sub­sti­tutes, such as ac­cess to point-to-point trans­port ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>In 2015, the num­ber of chauf­feured pri­vate-hire cars hit 10,485 – up from just 1,609 in 2014 and 614 in 2013. By the end of last year, the fig­ure had soared to 55,575.</p>
    <p>This, Tan Chong Mo­tor’s Mr Ron Lim noted, cre­ated a “price floor”. So, pre­mi­ums did not fall as much as in the pre­vi­ous pe­riod, when quo­tas were sim­i­lar to what they have been in the last five years.</p>
