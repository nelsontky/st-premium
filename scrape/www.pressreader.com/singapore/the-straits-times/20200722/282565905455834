    <p>De­scribed as “Harry Pot­ter and The Chron­i­cles Of Nar­nia for adults”, The Ma­gi­cians is a fan­tasy se­ries about a group of mil­len­ni­als en­rolled at a school for magic hid­den in New York – the cen­turies-old Brake­bills Univer­sity for Mag­i­cal Ped­a­gogy.</p>
    <p>The show, the first two sea­sons of which are now on Ama­zon Prime Video in Singapore, spins as in­tri­cate a mythol­ogy as the Pot­ter films based on the books of J.K. Rowl­ing and the Nar­nia sto­ries writ­ten by C.S. Lewis.</p>
    <p>And it has a following just as ded­i­cated.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2015 and re­cently air­ing its fifth and fi­nal sea­son in the United States, the se­ries was never a big rat­ings hit.</p>
    <p>But it ac­quired cult sta­tus for its blend of fan­tasy and ma­ture themes such as per­sonal trauma, power and priv­i­lege, with plenty of quippy, pop cul­ture-savvy ref­er­ences thrown in.</p>
    <p>As with Hog­warts, only a se­lect few are in­vited to study at Brake­bills, where they dis­cover a par­al­lel, Nar­nia-like di­men­sion known as Fil­lory – a place they thought ex­isted only in chil­dren’s books.</p>
    <p>But the cast and cre­ators say this is where the re­sem­blance with those other fan­tasy fran­chises ends, the story then turn­ing into an in­tense emo­tional drama ex­plor­ing the frus­tra­tions of be­ing hu­man, al­beit with mag­i­cal pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The show has re­ceived praise for this and how it de­vel­oped its fe­male char­ac­ters in par­tic­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Jade Tailor, 34, who plays a re­bel­lious stu­dent named Kady, says at a fan event in San Diego: “Magic comes from pain and all of these women are hu­man.</p>
    <p>“They’re tak­ing their pain, suf­fer­ing and the things they’re ex­pe­ri­enc­ing and chan­nelling it i nto power, and let­ting it power them into change. I think that’s the most heroic thing.”</p>
    <p>And none of the char­ac­ters is “per­fect and strong ev­ery sec­ond of the day”, adds Brit­tany Cur­ran, 30, who plays the wife of an­other stu­dent.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause no man or woman is that ev­ery day. All our char­ac­ters show you can be vul­ner­a­ble, you can have anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion, you can have things you are work­ing through and still be strong.”</p>
    <p>Fans cer­tainly con­nected to this and the cast re­veals just how loyal and sup­port­ive many of them are, whether it is dress­ing up as their char­ac­ters at comic-book con­ven­tions or con­tact­ing the ac­tors to ex­press what the show means to them.</p>
    <p>Says Olivia Tay­lor Dud­ley, the 34-year-old who plays a gifted Brake­bills stu­dent named Alice: “I love my Alices. They al­ways bring it with the (cos­play) dresses.”</p>
    <p>Ar­jun Gupta, 33, is Penny, a ma­gi­cian who can travel be­tween worlds. He says view­ers’ en­thu­si­asm for the se­ries made the ac­tors more con­fi­dent about putting their own stamp on the source ma­te­rial, a best-sell­ing 2009 to 2014 book tril­ogy by Lev Gross­man.</p>
    <p>“Of­ten with the books, (fans) get a sense of own­er­ship and imag­ine something – what the char­ac­ters are go­ing to look like, the way they move and speak. And that can be in­tim­i­dat­ing when you’re try­ing to be­come that per­son.”</p>
    <p>This is why their sup­port “has been such a bless­ing”, he ex­plains. “It’s al­lowed me, when play­ing Penny, to take even more risks.”</p>
    <p>Rick Wor­thy, 53, por­trays the dean of Brake­bills, Henry Fogg, a char­ac­ter of­ten com­pared to Harry Pot­ter’s Dum­ble­dore and a self­de­scribed “high-func­tion­ing al­co­holic”.</p>
    <p>This is why “ev­ery­one I meet now wants to drink with me”, the ac­tor says with a laugh. “And I want to drink with them too.”</p>
    <p>Hale Ap­ple­man, who plays a gay stu­dent named Eliot, has met many LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der, queer) view­ers for whom his char­ac­ter clearly means a lot.</p>
    <p>“It means the world to me to meet the kids who, a few years ago, maybe didn’t have the same kind of rep­re­sen­ta­tion on tele­vi­sion,” says the 34-year-old.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t al­ways see queer char­ac­ters, par­tic­u­larly in fan­tasy and genre shows. So Eliot is a hero to me as well.”</p>
    <p>The Ma­gi­cians is avail­able on Ama­zon Prime Video.</p>
