    <p>In an evening of firsts, the Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize vir­tu­ally crowned its first fe­male win­ner last night for English po­etry and gave out an un­prece­dented pair of dou­ble wins for both Chi­nese and</p>
    <p>English fic­tion. Mary­lyn Tan, 27, be­came the first woman in the bi­en­nial prize’s 28-year history to tri­umph for English po­etry. Her ar­cane and un­apolo­getic de­but col­lec­tion, Gaze Back, took on taboo top­ics from men­stru­a­tion to sex­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Its ti­tle draws on French fem­i­nist the­o­rist He­lene Cixous’ es­say The Laugh Of The Me­dusa, which refers to the Greek myth of the Gor­gon whose gaze turns men to stone.</p>
    <p>The cat­e­gory’s judges, led by for­mer Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val direc­tor Yeow Kai Chai, said in a state­ment: “Gaze Back is un­like any other po­etry ti­tle this year – a clar­ion call for gen­der and lin­guis­tic recla­ma­tion, sear­ing in its sassy con­fi­dence and univer­sal ap­petite.</p>
    <p>“It re­minds us of the re­spon­si­bil­ity of po­etry to con­front and con­test the power of lan­guage to de­ter­mine who we are and what we de­sire.”</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony for Sin­ga­pore’s old­est on­go­ing lit­er­ary award in all four of­fi­cial lan­guages was live-streamed on or­gan­iser Sin­ga­pore Book Coun­cil’s Face­book and YouTube pages.</p>
    <p>Tan said in a thank-you speech over video call that she was “gob­s­macked and hon­oured”.</p>
    <p>She added: “Thank you to my fel­low artists, writ­ers and every­one who has ever en­abled my brand of filthy, plea­sur­able and pur­pose­fully up­set­ting chaos. Es­pe­cially my par­ents, who are wor­ried all the time.”</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times: “I wrote Gaze Back to eman­ci­pate our bod­ies and minds from be­ing po­liced, and hope that con­tin­ues to in­form the dis­course.”</p>
    <p>Two Epi­gram Books ti­tles shared the prize for English fic­tion: Straits Times jour­nal­ist Ak­shita Nanda’s de­but novel Nimita’s Place, about two women named Nimita nav­i­gat­ing so­ci­ety’s ex­pec­ta­tions in In­dia and Sin­ga­pore, and spec­u­la­tive short story col­lec­tion Lion City by Ng Yi-Sheng, who pre­vi­ously won for English po­etry.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese fic­tion prize was split be­tween Chia Joo Ming’s SG50-cen­tric novel Kian Kok and Wong Koi Tet’s short story col­lec­tion Black Pan­ther.</p>
    <p>Wong also scored a win in Chi­nese cre­ative non-fic­tion with Dakota, about the lost hous­ing es­tate Dakota Cres­cent, where he grew up.</p>
    <p>Each win­ner will get $3,000, a tro­phy and a 12-month Sto­ry­tel au­dio­book gift sub­scrip­tion.</p>
    <p>Artist Shu­bigi Rao was sec­ond time suc­cess­ful in the English cre­ative non-fic­tion cat­e­gory, win­ning for Pulp II: A Vis­ual Bib­li­og­ra­phy Of The Ban­ished Book, the sec­ond vol­ume of her decade-long project on book de­struc­tion. The first, Pulp: A Short Bi­og­ra­phy Of The Ban­ished Book, was short­listed for the 2018 prize but did not win.</p>
    <p>Sithu­raj Pon­raj, an­other pre­vi­ous prize-win­ner, bagged the Tamil po­etry prize with his col­lec­tion It Is Easy To Be An Ital­ian and also tied for the merit prize in Tamil fic­tion.</p>
    <p>There were no win­ners for Malay and Tamil fic­tion, but there were dou­ble merit prizes for those cat­e­gories, with each merit win­ner get­ting $2,000.</p>
    <p>Al­most 3,000 mem­bers of the pub­lic voted in the in­au­gu­ral Read­ers’ Favourite cat­e­gory, which had four win­ners, in­clud­ing vet­eran Malay-lan­guage writer Peter Au­gus­tine Goh. Each win­ner will re­ceive $1,000 in cash, while their vot­ers stand a chance to win $50 book vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>There were 224 sub­mis­sions this year, a 30 per cent in­crease from 2018. Each prize cat­e­gory is judged by a panel of three writ­ers and in­dus­try ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Chief judges in­clude Es­planade com­mu­ni­ca­tions and con­tent head Clarissa Oon for English cre­ative non-fic­tion, Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent KTM Iqbal for Tamil po­etry and Dr Sa’eda Buang of the Asian Lan­guages and Cul­tures Aca­demic Group for Malay fic­tion.</p>
