    <p>This year in March, which feels a life­time ago, I, along with many oth­ers in Sin­ga­pore, stepped onto bal­conies and doorsteps, to ap­plaud our valiant Covid-19 health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>There was clapping, shout­ing, and the bang­ing of pans. I re­mem­ber tears filled my eyes.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tive emo­tional unity of the mo­ment was deeply mov­ing.</p>
    <p>As we clapped in Sin­ga­pore, oth­ers around the world clapped with us – from Is­tan­bul to Buenos Aires, Paris to Wuhan and Sydney, Mum­bai to Mi­lan. In the face of fear, these shared mo­ments brought a sense of hope and to­geth­er­ness wher­ever they hap­pened in the world.</p>
    <p>In March, we ex­pected the pan­demic to be over by June, then Septem­ber, then the end of the year. Now, in Novem­ber, our age of in­no­cence is over. It may be this time next year be­fore the chaos is con­trolled. Clapping now seems a life­time ago. Covid-19 fa­tigue af­fects us all.</p>
    <p>The ul­ti­mate mea­sure of a man is not where he stands in mo­ments of com­fort and con­ve­nience, but where he stands in times of chal­lenge and con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>These words by Amer­i­can civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr shine a light on where we are to­day, and many of us are not do­ing too well.</p>
    <p>Around the world, peo­ple strug­gle with ba­sic prac­ti­cal is­sues, and the dras­tic cur­tail­ment of nor­mal life. The virus is ram­pant, but the ac­com­pa­ny­ing fear, our un­con­scious re­ac­tion to a bad sit­u­a­tion, lurks within us as an equal pan­demic.</p>
    <p>If we can re­spond to sit­u­a­tions in­stead of re­act­ing to them, we of­ten find a way through, but meet­ing chal­lenges is not easy. They can break us, or they can make us if we see op­por­tu­nity in­stead of op­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>All chal­lenges work on two lev­els: The com­mon level that brought the sit­u­a­tion about through what­ever cause, and the deeper level that waits to see if we can recog­nise the chance for in­ner learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery spir­i­tual teach­ing in the world con­firms that a life with­out dif­fi­cul­ties is a life with­out growth. Wood shines when rubbed smooth with sand­pa­per. A sword heated in fire and beaten again and again will even­tu­ally cut through the hard­est sub­stance.</p>
    <p>An un­ex­pected book came to me re­cently, writ­ten by a man who spent 18 years on death row in the US after he was wrongly con­victed of three mur­ders. Mr Damien Echols was 19 when he was ar­rested in 1993, and nearly 40 on his re­lease from prison.</p>
    <p>It took nearly two decades to prove his in­no­cence. In his book, Life After Death, he re­counts the life he spent in jail, filled with the unspeakabl­e, parts of it in soli­tary con­fine­ment 23 hours a day. Yet he found a way to turn the bru­tal neg­a­tiv­ity of his ex­pe­ri­ence into some­thing of a pos­i­tive na­ture.</p>
    <p>He used prison as a monas­tic re­treat and an op­por­tu­nity for self-di­rected study. In jail, he was or­dained into the Rin­zai tra­di­tion of Ja­panese Bud­dhism and sat in zazen med­i­ta­tion each day.</p>
    <p>He also stud­ied an an­cient spir­i­tual or­der, in­cor­po­rat­ing Gnos­tic Chris­tian­ity, Taoist en­ergy prac­tices and es­o­teric Ju­daism. As his life grew more re­stricted on death row, his stud­ies grew more in­tense, spir­i­tual rit­u­als keep­ing his mind and senses alive.</p>
    <p>He was try­ing to achieve a con­scious­ness that lived en­tirely in the present mo­ment, not dwelling in the past or fu­ture. These prac­tices be­came the linch­pin of his life. For days at a time, he could for­get he was in prison and be ex­cited each morn­ing to start a new day.</p>
    <p>Liv­ing freely in the world again after his re­lease from jail in 2011, he re­calls his years of hor­rific in­car­cer­a­tion with lit­tle bit­ter­ness. Most peo­ple view his decades in prison as a lost life, but he takes an op­po­site view.</p>
    <p>The great­est cause for de­pres­sion and dis­ease, he says, is not liv­ing the life you were born into this world to live. He found that once he could ac­cess that deep­est part of him­self, the ab­ject fear and de­spair he lived with left him.</p>
    <p>You can live on one of two en­ergy wave­lengths, he says, one is love and the other is fear. Dis­cov­er­ing what your will is, and ded­i­cat­ing your­self to it, turns life into a trans­for­ma­tional ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at the book in my hands, it struck me that Mr Echols’ life is but an ex­treme mi­cro­cosm of what the world is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in these pan­demic days. The chal­lenge of liv­ing with some­thing we can­not con­trol is daunt­ing. We re­sist when things do not un­fold as we wish, and yet few lives go ac­cord­ing to plan.</p>
    <p>At one point or an­other, life will give us what­ever ex­pe­ri­ence is most help­ful for our in­ner growth. At this par­tic­u­lar time, whether we ac­knowl­edge it or not, we are all be­ing forced to con­front our ul­ti­mate fear – death.</p>
    <p>In this time of life-threat­en­ing chal­lenge, the writ­ings of two men are en­joy­ing a resur­gence of pop­u­lar­ity. In dif­fer­ent but par­al­lel ways, the ni­hilist ex­plo­rations of Ger­man philoso­pher Friedrich Ni­et­zsche and the holo­caust sur­vival mem­oir of Aus­trian psy­chi­a­trist Vik­tor Frankl both re­veal ways to sur­vive ad­ver­sity, to en­dure the un­en­durable.</p>
    <p>Life’s pains, ac­cord­ing to Ni­et­zsche, can­not be avoided and should be recog­nised as an in­evitable step in reach­ing ful­fil­ment. Frankl puts it more gen­tly.</p>
    <p>When we are no longer able to change a sit­u­a­tion, we are chal­lenged to change our­selves.</p>
    <p>What­ever our cir­cum­stances, life is es­sen­tially an in­ner jour­ney.</p>
    <p>The re­sponses we choose when meet­ing our chal­lenges de­ter­mine the way we live, the qual­ity of our life.</p>
    <p>For many of us, this pan­demic year, with its un­prece­dented or­deals and no end yet in sight, may have a sil­ver lin­ing.</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple have risen to their own in­di­vid­ual chal­lenges, dis­tress­ing as they may be, and found new depths in them­selves, of in­sight and hu­man­ity. Per­haps the pain we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing with this pan­demic is push­ing us to­wards a bet­ter ver­sion of our­selves.</p>
