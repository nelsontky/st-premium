    <p>LON­DON • Shop­pers re­turned to Eng­land’s high streets on Wed­nes­day as shops re­opened fol­low­ing the end of a four-week coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>On a day dubbed “Wild Wed­nes­day” be­cause of an ex­pec­ta­tion of huge num­bers of shop­pers, cus­tomers wear­ing masks and laden with bags flocked to stores in Ox­ford Street in cen­tral Lon­don.</p>
    <p>One cus­tomer, Ms Char­lotte Cobb, told Agence France-Presse the lat­est lock­down had been “tricky”, but said she was “just so happy to be back”. “With Christ­mas, it’s just bril­liant,” she said. “I’m re­ally ex­cited.”</p>
    <p>At Sel­fridges’ flag­ship depart­ment store, staff greeted crowds with ap­plause, and a se­quinned Santa Claus danced un­der glit­ter­ing sil­ver disco balls as cus­tomers shopped.</p>
    <p>Store di­rec­tor Maeve Wall said it was a Christ­mas “like no other”, and “cer­tainly not one we would have an­tic­i­pated”.</p>
    <p>“It’s about mak­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence as plea­sur­able as we can for cus­tomers, so we will main­tain the fun and ex­cite­ment,” she added.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of re­stric­tions has come as a re­lief to the hard-hit re­tail in­dus­try. Non-es­sen­tial shops were forced to close, com­pound­ing losses dur­ing a lock­down from March to June.</p>
    <p>But a new re­gional sys­tem for curb­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus is now in place, with parts of the coun­try in the high­est of three tiers still ef­fec­tively shut­tered.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem – de­signed to al­low fam­i­lies and friends to gather at Christ­mas – has been crit­i­cised as do­ing lit­tle to re­in­state cher­ished free­doms and help the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Most of Eng­land’s 55 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion have gone straight into tier two or three – de­pend­ing on lo­cal in­fec­tion rates – lim­it­ing house­hold mix­ing and the re­open­ing of the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Just 1 per cent of places in the coun­try – the south-west county of Corn­wall, the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight in the south – are in the least re­stric­tive tier one.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, him­self a Covid-19 sur­vivor, suc­ceeded in win­ning a vote on the mea­sures in Par­lia­ment on Tues­day night, de­spite op­po­si­tion within his own Con­ser­va­tive ranks.</p>
    <p>ECO­NOMIC CON­CERNS</p>
    <p>Hopes that life could re­turn to nor­mal came a step closer af­ter Bri­tain an­nounced ap­proval had been given to roll out Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 jab from next week.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment, un­der pres­sure af­ter 59,000 deaths in the out­break, hopes to use it and other vac­cines due to be given the green light along­side rapid com­mu­nity test­ing.</p>
    <p>Lon­don – Bri­tain’s cap­i­tal and driv­ing force of the econ­omy – is in tier two, mean­ing pubs where food is served and restau­rants can re­open, with so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>But in tier-three ar­eas – with some 23 mil­lion peo­ple and Bri­tain’s sec­ond-largest city, Birm­ing­ham – hos­pi­tal­ity venues will re­main closed ex­cept for take­aways.</p>
    <p>The curbs have prompted fresh con­cerns for the econ­omy, which Fi­nance Min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak said is fac­ing an 11.3 per cent con­trac­tion this year – the worst in 300 years.</p>
    <p>Those fears were stoked fur­ther this week by the col­lapse of re­tail group Ar­ca­dia, which owns pop­u­lar high-street stores Top­shop and Bur­ton, and the Deben­hams chain.</p>
    <p>They have been forced into ad­min­is­tra­tion, blam­ing the im­pact of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions on trade al­ready un­der pres­sure from on­line com­peti­tors.</p>
