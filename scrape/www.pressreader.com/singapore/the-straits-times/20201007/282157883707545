    <p>The arts sec­tor has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pan­demic, and needs more sup­port from the Gov­ern­ment, said Ms Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Highlighti­ng the strug­gles of arts work­ers, she sug­gested en­hanc­ing the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), as well as ex­tend­ing in­come sup­port to free­lancers who did not qual­ify for the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs).</p>
    <p>Free­lancers form a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the arts ecosys­tem in Sin­ga­pore. The Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s (NAC) 2016 Arts and Cul­ture Em­ploy­ment Study found that 47 per cent of those sur­veyed were free­lancers – higher than the na­tional pro­por­tion of 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Chronic in­come pres­sures on arts work­ers, as well as other work­ers, come from a lack of reg­u­la­tions on a group of em­ploy­ees called ‘per­ma­nent ca­su­als’,” said Ms Tan, re­fer­ring to free­lancers who have not ben­e­fited from JSS or Sirs.</p>
    <p>“Al­though ‘per­ma­nent ca­su­als’ might work full-time or part-time, they are paid hourly with no health or leave ben­e­fits.”</p>
    <p>In her ad­journ­ment mo­tion at the end of yes­ter­day’s sit­ting, she also called for more gov­ern­ment in­vest­ment in the de­vel­op­ment of the arts.</p>
    <p>She sug­gested craft­ing a wage frame­work, in con­sul­ta­tion with work­ers in the sec­tor, “so that artists are not sub­ject to the de­val­u­a­tion of their work and a race to the bot­tom to get jobs”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan also pro­posed pro­vid­ing artists and en­ter­tain­ers with business men­tor­ship and mar­ket­ing train­ing.</p>
    <p>A lack of sta­ble in­come has forced some peo­ple in the sec­tor to seek other jobs, she noted.</p>
    <p>“If we con­tinue to do noth­ing more for them in terms of fi­nan­cial sup­port dur­ing this time, they may be lost to other sec­tors, to the longterm detri­ment of our arts and en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try. An en­tire sec­tor may be at risk of be­ing wiped out.”</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity And Youth Low Yen Ling re­sponded by out­lin­ing the var­i­ous forms of sup­port avail­able to arts work­ers – from broad-based mea­sures, such as the JSS, to the $55 mil­lion Arts and Cul­ture Re­silience</p>
    <p>Pack­age (ACRP).</p>
    <p>By the end of Au­gust, ACRP fund­ing had cre­ated more than 6,000 work and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and sup­ported more than 900 dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion projects and pro­grammes, she said.</p>
    <p>She added that the Ca­pa­bil­ity De­vel­op­ment Scheme for the Arts has sup­ported about 600 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, of which around half were for free­lancers. Mean­while, the Dig­i­tal Pre­sen­ta­tion Grant for the Arts has sup­ported more than 300 projects and pro­vided around 4,500 work op­por­tu­ni­ties, of which about 1,100 were for free­lancers.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Ms Tan’s re­mark that some arts work­ers have ben­e­fited from nei­ther the JSS nor Sirs, Ms Low said her min­istry is help­ing work­ers en­gaged by cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions – in­clud­ing the Es­planade and Arts House Lim­ited – to ap­ply for gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes they are el­i­gi­ble for. Free­lancers can also make use of the NAC’s Arts Re­source Hub, she added.</p>
    <p>On the ACRP’s Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion Fund, which pri­ori­tises pro­duc­tions that have been rated Gen­eral, Ms Tan urged the Gov­ern­ment to re­con­sider this.</p>
    <p>“Parental con­trols on on­line me­dia plat­forms ex­ist for a rea­son, for par­ents to be in­volved and ex­er­cise the nec­es­sary con­trol over chil­dren’s me­dia con­sump­tion. This should not be a re­spon­si­bil­ity that is shifted over to the state, with costs that the arts and en­ter­tain­ment sec­tor ends up bear­ing, to the detri­ment of an in­dus­try’s vi­brancy and sus­tain­abil­ity,” she said.</p>
    <p>Re­ply­ing, Ms Low said: “Un­like live per­for­mances which are sub­ject to classifica­tion ratings un­der IMDA (In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity), on­line con­tent is eas­ily and gen­er­ally avail­able with no age seg­re­ga­tion. This makes it pru­dent... to un­der­write pro­duc­tions rated Gen­eral.”</p>
    <p>She said the NAC has also con­tin­ued to pro­vide funds through its reg­u­lar grant schemes and com­mis­sions. These have been en­hanced to in­clude dig­i­tal works and pre­sen­ta­tions, and could in­clude works with a higher rating.</p>
