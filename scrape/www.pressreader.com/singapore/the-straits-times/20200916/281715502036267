    <p>There were 34 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,488.</p>
    <p>There were also six new im­ported cases, com­pris­ing two permanent res­i­dents, one work pass holder, one work per­mit holder and two de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases were asymp­to­matic and all had re­turned from In­dia. They had also been placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Plaza Sin­ga­pura, VivoCity, Junc­tion 8 and Hougang Mall were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The three places vis­ited by con­firmed Covid-19 cases in Plaza Sin­ga­pura be­tween Sept 3 and 7 were Tim Ho Wan, Se­cret Recipe and Nando’s.</p>
    <p>Ikea Tampines and the Burger King out­let in Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 1 were also added to MOH’s list.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>It has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>No new cases in the com­mu­nity were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 28 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among them, 13 were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 15 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance testing, like ros­tered rou­tine testing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from two cases two weeks ago to one in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also fallen from a daily av­er­age of two cases to one over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 82 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,869 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 51 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 526 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
