    <p>Step­ping into lo­cal fash­ion la­bel Klarra’s pop-up store feels al­most like step­ping into a friend’s home.</p>
    <p>The 1,489 sq ft store at The Shoppes at Ma­rina Bay Sands (MBS) could be an apart­ment – with a room on the side hid­den away by gauze cur­tains, and a cushy couch and shelf dis­play in the front.</p>
    <p>Called The Gallery, the room pro­vides a con­cealed spot for cus­tomers to try Klarra’s new shoe col­lec­tion com­fort­ably.</p>
    <p>In another cor­ner, a wooden din­ing ta­ble framed by a cus­tom­made plant oa­sis dis­plays new items from the brand.</p>
    <p>The idea was in­deed to make it feel like home, says founder Beatrice Tan, 32.</p>
    <p>“The brand’s direc­tion has al­ways been about cre­at­ing re­li­able, wear­able pieces that give cus­tomers mi l e a g e – some­thing that is com­fort­able and here to stay.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to trans­late that into the store con­cept as well,” she says.</p>
    <p>She was in­spired on a trip to New York City in Jan­uary last year, where she shopped at con­cept stores with de­signs that ex­per­i­mented be­yond the “con­ven­tional racks and clothes”.</p>
    <p>Back home, she sim­i­larly ex­plored unique shapes and forms in her choice of mir­rors and fur­ni­ture, cus­tom-mak­ing many of the pieces.</p>
    <p>The decor for the MBS pop-up, which will op­er­ate till June 30, was com­pleted in three weeks. She saved costs by re­tain­ing the main struc­tures of the store – which pre­vi­ously housed another fash­ion brand – such as the fit­ting rooms and store­room.</p>
    <p>The knick-knacks dis­played on the shelves were sourced on past trav­els and from her own home, says Ms Tan, who is also a fash­ion in­flu­encer (@beat­ri­ce­says).</p>
    <p>Cu­rated to suit “the Klarra girl’s life­style”, they in­clude a globe for “the woman who en­joys trav­el­ling” as well as books on travel, fash­ion and cof­fee.</p>
    <p>Though it is early days, Ms Tan has no­ticed that cus­tomers are more in­clined to spend both time and money here. They snap pic­tures and linger in the store when they are com­fort­able.</p>
    <p>“Their part­ners or fam­ily mem­bers stay­ing around in the store helps them shop at ease, so there is no rush,” says Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally with smaller stores, the boyfriends are forced to stand out­side. But here, I see them look­ing around and feel­ing com­fort­able on the couch – so I sup­pose that does trans­late to sales.”</p>
    <p>WHERE: 01-68, The Shoppes @ Ma­rina Bay Sands</p>
