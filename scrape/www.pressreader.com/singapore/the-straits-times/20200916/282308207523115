    <p>SHARE OF CIT­I­GROUP’S GLOBAL WORK­FORCE THAT WILL BE AF­FECTED BY JOB CUTS</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Cit­i­group will re­sume job cuts start­ing this week, join­ing ri­vals such as Wells Fargo in end­ing an ear­lier pledge to pause staff re­duc­tions dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The cuts will af­fect less than 1 per cent of the global work­force, the bank said on Mon­day in a state­ment. It added that with re­cent hir­ing, over­all head­count will prob­a­bly not show any drops.</p>
    <p>The re­duc­tions will come as the bank is fac­ing a likely rev­enue drop and an­other in­crease to loan-loss re­serves this quar­ter as the pan­demic drags on, as well as years of ex­penses to im­prove risk con­trols.</p>
    <p>The Of­fice of the Comptrolle­r of the Cur­rency (OCC) and the Fed­eral Re­serve are weigh­ing pub­lic rep­ri­mands of the firm be­cause of con­tin­ued de­fi­cien­cies in its in­fra­struc­ture and con­trol func­tions, said sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion to elim­i­nate even a sin­gle col­league role is very dif­fi­cult, es­pe­cially dur­ing these chal­leng­ing times,” Cit­i­group said.</p>
    <p>“We will do our best to sup­port each per­son, in­clud­ing of­fer­ing the abil­ity to ap­ply for open roles in other parts of the firm and pro­vid­ing sev­er­ance pack­ages.”</p>
    <p>The bank said it has hired more than 26,000 peo­ple this year, and over one-third of those jobs were in the United States. The lender had about 204,000 em­ploy­ees at the end of the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Banks have re­sumed job cuts in re­cent weeks after pledg­ing en masse to pause such ac­tions ear­lier this year. Many firms are push­ing to cut costs as the pan­demic has dragged on, threat­en­ing lenders with higher credit costs and crimp­ing rev­enue growth.</p>
    <p>Chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Mark Ma­son said on Mon­day that the bank is hop­ing to keep ex­penses flat to slightly up this quar­ter as per­sis­tently low in­ter­est rates and a slow­down in con­sumer spend­ing have weighed on the lender’s re­sults.</p>
    <p>While rev­enue from fixed in­come and eq­ui­ties trad­ing is likely to climb by a per­cent­age in the low dou­ble dig­its in the third quar­ter, firm-wide rev­enue will prob­a­bly still fall, Mr Ma­son said.</p>
    <p>The lender will also likely have to set aside more in re­serves to cover po­ten­tial losses in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group dropped 5.6 per cent to US$48.15 in reg­u­lar New York trad­ing, the worst per­for­mance in the S&P 500 Fi­nan­cials Index.</p>
    <p>The bank has been in­vest­ing more in im­prov­ing its in­fra­struc­ture and con­trol func­tions after spend­ing roughly US$1 bil­lion (S$1.36 bil­lion) on such ef­forts this year. It is in dis­cus­sions with the Fed and OCC over im­prov­ing those func­tions, the sources said.</p>
    <p>“While we never com­ment on our dis­cus­sions with reg­u­la­tors, we are com­pletely com­mit­ted to im­prov­ing our risk and con­trol en­vi­ron­ment,” Cit­i­group said in a sep­a­rate state­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise that we are not yet where we need to be and that has to change. We have thus re­dou­bled our ef­forts and have made im­prov­ing our risk and con­trol en­vi­ron­ment a strate­gic pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>Still, the loom­ing reg­u­la­tory hur­dle ac­cel­er­ated the tim­ing of chief ex­ec­u­tive Michael Cor­bat’s an­nounce­ment that he would step down next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Cor­bat wanted fresh lead­er­ship in­stalled ahead of an­nounc­ing what could be a years-long re­me­di­a­tion process to sat­isfy reg­u­la­tors, ac­cord­ing to the sources.</p>
    <p>The bank will off­set in­vest­ments in bet­ter gov­er­nance with plans to re­duce its real estate foot­print and by mov­ing some em­ploy­ees to les­s­ex­pen­sive cities and of­fices.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­son said: “I can­not em­pha­sise enough, there is no greater pri­or­ity for the en­tire man­age­ment team than get­ting to what we would char­ac­terise as a best-in­class risk and con­trol en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
