    <p>Van­guard is a McDon­ald’s Chi­nese New Year burger of a movie – its over­stuffed lay­ers come gar­nished with hol­i­day scenes while sugar is poured over a re­as­sur­ingly fa­mil­iar list of in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>The meat patty in this mirth­ful mon­stros­ity is brand name Jackie Chan. He wisely leaves most of the martial arts ac­tion to younger ac­tors such as Ai Lun, who is given a kitchen pots-and-cutlery com­edy fight scene taken from Chan’s play­book.</p>
    <p>This be­ing a hol­i­day block­buster, al­beit one with a long-de­layed re­lease, quot­ing from Chan’s own cat­a­logue is nor­mal, even ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The thin ex­cuse for a plot lets Chan, play­ing Tang, the boss of pri­vate se­cu­rity com­pany Van­guard, dash from Lon­don to</p>
    <p>Dubai and else­where. Aided by his crew, Tang hopes to foil a kidnapping in­volv­ing a Chi­nese busi­ness­man Qin (Jackson Lou), his daugh­ter Fa­reeda (Xu Ruo­han) and ter­ror­ists seek­ing a high-tech weapon.</p>
    <p>The some­thing-for-ev­ery­one na­ture of the project is best de­scribed as – take a deep breath – a fam­ily-friendly, mil­i­taris­tic gun­play, martial arts ac­tion-com­edy with a pro-China take on world af­fairs.</p>
    <p>As if to fur­ther pun­ish film-maker Stan­ley Tong, a fre­quent Chan col­lab­o­ra­tor, po­lit­i­cal events that have hap­pened since the vi­ral out­break have made the film’s fi­nale seem al­most com­i­cally op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>Added to that is the Achilles’ heel of too many Asian films: sloppy vis­ual ef­fects. The African an­i­mals here would look fake even if viewed on a first-gen­er­a­tion iPhone, while the Fast And Fu­ri­ous (2001 to 2019) homage, fea­tur­ing ex­otic cars streak­ing down Dubai’s streets, reeks of vin­tage con­sole games.</p>
    <p>But like they say: It would not be a Chi­nese New Year burger if it didn’t come with ex­tra cheese.</p>
    <p>JIANG ZIYA: LE­GEND OF DEIFI­CA­TION</p>
    <p>An­other fes­tive film com­ing out of pause mode is an­i­mated fea­ture Jiang Ziya: Le­gend Of Deifi­ca­tion, the fol­low-up to Ne Zha (2019), the high­est-gross­ing non-Amer­i­can an­i­ma­tion film at the Chi­nese box of­fice.</p>
    <p>The lush, ex­pen­sive-look­ing adap­ta­tion of a 16th-cen­tury</p>
    <p>Chi­nese novel In­vesti­ture Of The Gods is part of a cin­e­matic uni­verse of deities, de­mons and hu­mans. There is an at­tempt to ex­plain back­sto­ries, but the dense cos­mol­ogy – which in­cludes var­i­ous realms and classes of su­per­nat­u­ral be­ings – will give the unini­ti­ated the feeling of hav­ing dropped into an Avengers movie while know­ing noth­ing of the pre­ced­ing Thor, Iron Man or Cap­tain Amer­ica films.</p>
    <p>The im­mor­tal Jiang Ziya is on the verge of pro­mo­tion af­ter the events of the first movie – af­ter all, he has de­feated the fox de­mon and is ready to ful­fil his destiny. As a test of loy­alty, the gods ask him to per­form a fi­nal task be­fore his as­cen­sion, which he fails be­cause of his em­pa­thy for hu­mans. For that, he is ban­ished to the earthly realm, where Jiang, with the help of clan mem­bers, hu­mans and adorable su­per­nat­u­ral crea­tures, has to earn redemp­tion.</p>
    <p>The story’s fo­cus on swirling ac­tion at the ex­pense of char­ac­ter can be frus­trat­ing – if lib­er­ties can be taken in the area of cute an­i­mals, why not also add more colour to the two-di­men­sional Jiang and his friends? But for an in­tox­i­cat­ing vis­ual over­load, this bat­tle of the di­vini­ties told in twitchy video game-in­flu­enced graph­ics is hard to beat.</p>
    <p>LEAP</p>
    <p>The sports biopic Leap tracks the Chi­nese women’s na­tional vol­ley­ball team over 40 years of its his­tory, from the time it came from nowhere to world-beating sta­tus in the early 1980s, to its lean years be­fore its re­turn to form in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Much of the team’s story is tied to the story of one per­son, the player-turned-coach Lang Ping, played by Gong Li. Hong Kong direc­tor Peter Chan (the ro­mance Com­rades, Al­most A Love Story, 1996) does what he can to make this a story about solid Chi­nese val­ues – the will­ing­ness to en­dure a tor­tu­ous train­ing regime, the self-loathing that comes with los­ing – and ef­fec­tively makes the point that in the 1970s, the na­tion’s cit­i­zens were built dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>But through­out, the tow­er­ing fig­ure of Lang, still a deeply re­spected fig­ure in the coun­try, dom­i­nates. But she re­mains an enigma. The film’s lack of in­sight into her mind, given her im­por­tance to the story, frus­trates.</p>
    <p>PINOC­CHIO</p>
    <p>Pinoc­chio, Ital­ian writer Carlo Col­lodi’s 19th-cen­tury tale of the tit­u­lar pup­pet who comes to life, has been adapted for film sev­eral times, most fa­mously by Dis­ney in the clas­sic 1940 an­i­mated fea­ture.</p>
    <p>Just as Dis­ney has done with some of its works, Ital­ian film-maker Mat­teo Gar­rone (the award-win­ning crime drama Go­mor­rah, 2008) has at­tempted a live-ac­tion ver­sion of the fan­tasy. And like Dis­ney when it tries to make car­toon fly­ing ele­phants and talk­ing orang utans look real, this project is a mis­fire.</p>
    <p>Gar­rone uses spe­cial ef­fects to make child ac­tor Fed­erico Ie­lapi look prop­erly wooden. But in the style of fan­tasy mas­ters like Terry Gil­liam (Time Ban­dits, 1981; The Ad­ven­tures Of Baron Mun­chausen, 1988), dwarf ac­tors in heavy pros­thet­ics play sup­port­ing char­ac­ters. He meets them af­ter he is sep­a­rated from his fa­ther, Gepetto (Roberto Benigni).</p>
    <p>Gar­rone’s ad­her­ence to Col­lodi’s story, with its 19th-cen­tury val­ues – disobe­di­ent chil­dren de­serve cruel pun­ish­ments, for ex­am­ple – and ram­bling, one-thing-af­ter-an­other style do the film no good. That anachro­nis­tic voice, paired with the low-key re­al­ism of the vi­su­als, are an odd pair­ing.</p>
    <p>The ver­sion shown in Sin­ga­pore has English di­a­logue dubbed over the orig­i­nal Ital­ian to make the film more palat­able to fam­i­lies with chil­dren. This is a strange de­ci­sion given the film’s de­cid­edly non-cute look, which some might call grotesque, made worse by how the English voices have un­nec­es­sar­ily strong Ital­ian ac­cents.</p>
    <p>ROGUE</p>
    <p>Open­ing this week but not re­viewed is mil­i­tary ac­tion drama Rogue, star­ring Megan Fox as the sol­dier-for-hire of the ti­tle. She leads her team into Africa to ex­tract hostages while bat­tling rebel fight­ers and a man-eat­ing pride of lions. It is di­rected by M.J. Bas­sett, who comes to the project af­ter helm­ing well-re­ceived ac­tion tele­vi­sion shows Al­tered Car­bon (2018 to 2020) and Strike Back (2010 to 2020).</p>
