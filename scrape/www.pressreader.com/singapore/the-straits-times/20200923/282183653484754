    <p>Ku­dos to Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam for the com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing women that is be­ing un­der­taken (Re­view of women’s is­sues to change mind­sets on equal­ity, Sept 21).</p>
    <p>I did not think I would live to see the day when a gov­ern­ment stal­wart would cham­pion gen­der equal­ity as a fun­da­men­tal value to be in­cul­cated into our col­lec­tive con­scious­ness, with ev­ery boy and girl be­ing taught at an early age to give equal re­spect and con­sid­er­a­tion to both gen­ders.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter has stressed that equal­ity must not be just a for­mal­ity, but also sub­stan­tive with changes oc­cur­ring at a struc­tural level. The first straight­for­ward step would be to en­shrine this in the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the pas­sage of a very en­light­ened piece of leg­is­la­tion in 1961 called the Women’s Char­ter – but which is rightly a fam­ily char­ter – the cur­rent re­view could be the next mo­men­tous step for us to be em­u­lated and lauded glob­ally as a far-sighted and pro­gres­sive na­tion.</p>
    <p>In my mind, this ef­fort is highly mean­ing­ful and comes from a real un­der­stand­ing that gen­der equal­ity is not only the moral thing to do but also has an im­pact on our so­cio-eco­nomic progress. Of­ten, it is not recog­nised that ful­fill­ing women’s po­ten­tial is our se­cret weapon to uplift­ing the whole of so­ci­ety in ev­ery pos­si­ble way.</p>
    <p>This jour­ney is not go­ing to be short or easy as it in­volves chang­ing en­trenched mind­sets of­ten but­tressed by cul­tural and re­li­gious be­liefs, but the end re­sult will be won­der­ful and bring so­ci­ety to­gether to progress to the next stage of hu­man devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Also, as this mind­set change is be­ing in­ter­nalised, it will spur a re­think and a change in at­ti­tude to­wards other forms of in­equal­ity that di­vide our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In­equal­ity in all forms causes con­flict be­cause of in­ter­nalised im­plicit and ex­plicit bi­ases lead­ing to dis­crim­i­na­tion, and it hampers us in our jour­ney to­wards build­ing “a demo­cratic so­ci­ety based on jus­tice and equal­ity so as to achieve hap­pi­ness, pros­per­ity and progress for our na­tion”.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, it is not recog­nised that ful­fill­ing women’s po­ten­tial is our se­cret weapon to uplift­ing the whole of so­ci­ety in ev­ery pos­si­ble way.</p>
