    <p>In an age of dis­rup­tion, some cor­po­ra­tions want to re­main a re­as­sur­ing pres­ence to the har­ried con­sumer. One such name is 70-year-old food and house­hold prod­ucts spe­cial­ist Lam Soon.</p>
    <p>Its ex­ec­u­tive chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive, Mr Whang Shang Ying, wants to en­sure Lam Soon re­mains that way.</p>
    <p>“Dis­rup­tion aside, most peo­ple look for com­fort and re­as­sur­ance,” said the 59-year-old grand­son of the late founder Ng Keng Soon. “We want to be that re­as­sur­ing brand for them.”</p>
    <p>Lam Soon has come a long way since its found­ing as a sole pro­pri­etor­ship in 1929 by the late Mr Ng, who came from Xi­a­men in China. He named it Lam Soon Can­nery, us­ing the Hokkien word Lam for “south” with his name.</p>
    <p>Lam Soon started by pro­duc­ing soya sauce, and, after World War</p>
    <p>II, ex­panded into canned foods, cof­fee, cook­ing oil and laun­dry soap.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was in­cor­po­rated in 1950.</p>
    <p>To­day, Lam Soon has more than 500 brands and op­er­ates in four coun­tries – Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia Thai­land and Viet­nam – where it em­ploys 6,500 peo­ple and ex­ports to 50 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It rakes in sales of more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.3 bil­lion) per year, and has about 12,500 ha of palm oil plan­ta­tions in Malaysia and south­ern Thai­land where they have been eco-cer­ti­fied un­der the Global Stan­dard for Sus­tain­able Palm Oil (RSPO).</p>
    <p>Some of Lam Soon’s prod­ucts, like its clean­ing de­ter­gents, have en­joyed com­pounded an­nual sales growth of more than 70 per cent. While still largely a fam­ily-con­trolled com­pany, Lam Soon main­tains a list­ing in Thai­land, where its mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion is 5 bil­lion baht (S$222.5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Mr Whang, who has a law de­gree from Ox­ford Univer­sity, joined Lam Soon in 1994 after a short stint at Drew & Napier, when his fa­ther Whang Tar Liang, who has a de­gree in chem­istry, was still head­ing the com­pany. In 2000, his fa­ther bought out his late brother Whang Tar Choung’s shares in the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The younger Mr Whang at­tributes Lam Soon’s suc­cess and longevity to its abil­ity to adapt to chang­ing cir­cum­stances. This in­cluded a change in the busi­ness model in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>“We shut down our fac­to­ries here in Jalan Jurong Kechil around 1992, which meant we had to source prod­ucts and raw ma­te­ri­als from our sis­ter com­pa­nies. That pre­sented chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>But it also pro­vided new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“With­out a man­u­fac­tur­ing base, we evolved Sin­ga­pore into a ser­vice hub which would man­age all Lam Soon brands. We also di­ver­si­fied our prod­uct range.”</p>
    <p>This strat­egy saw Lam Soon tak­ing on third-party brands, while de­vel­op­ing its own brands from new sources.</p>
    <p>“We started look­ing be­yond what we pro­duce to what peo­ple want,” Mr Whang said. “Sin­ga­pore, be­ing a free port, pro­vided us the op­por­tu­nity to source new prod­ucts from around the world. Mean­while, we al­ready had strong sales and dis­tri­bu­tion net­works.”</p>
    <p>One of its more re­cent ven­tures is its Na­turel brand or­ganic olive oil, sourced and bot­tled at source in Spain. This was a ma­jor leap for a com­pany known mainly for its tra­di­tional Knife brand cook­ing oil blends.</p>
    <p>Lam Soon’s “new age” food prod­ucts have since ex­panded into or­ganic pasta from Italy, or­ganic brown rice and red rice from Thai­land, and a range of or­ganic pasta sauces.</p>
    <p>Mr Whang said the com­pany has had to keep up with chang­ing tastes and pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>“Con­sumer tastes have evolved over the years, and they vary in dif­fer­ent mar­kets,” he noted. “We have to cater for this, as one might put it, horses for cour­ses.”</p>
    <p>One of the most no­tice­able shifts in con­sumer be­hav­iour has been ris­ing health con­scious­ness and en­vi­ron­men­tal aware­ness.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore, be­ing a cos­mopoli­tan place, pro­vides a good test bed of de­mand in an ur­banised and mod­ern so­ci­ety. Sin­ga­pore­ans are open, but de­mand qual­ity. And they don’t mind pay­ing for it.</p>
    <p>“It is the same in other ur­banised so­ci­eties. This is why prod­ucts such as olive oil and or­ganic pasta are be­com­ing more pop­u­lar. We now im­port Knife brand sesame oil from Ja­pan.”</p>
    <p>In an age of lab­o­ra­tory- grown meats and plant-based burger pat­ties, how does Lam Soon view tech­no­log­i­cal devel­op­ment in food prod­ucts?</p>
    <p>“We are watch­ing this closely,” he said. “But as a 70- year-old com­pany, we don’t have to jump into ar­eas that we are not fa­mil­iar with or have enough ex­pe­ri­ence. We have enough on our plate and will adopt a wait-and-see at­ti­tude for now.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the pan­demic, Lam Soon has had a good 2020. “It has been a dif­fi­cult year for ev­ery­one,” Mr Whang said. “But with peo­ple trav­el­ling less, stay­ing home to cook, clean and wash, our sales have hit an all-time high this year. In fact, de­mand for our prod­ucts has grown some 25 per cent. Per­haps, it’s also the ki­asu hoard­ing men­tal­ity dur­ing the shut­downs!”</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing how much stress the Covid-19 pan­demic has put on seg­ments of so­ci­ety, Lam Soon re­cently do­nated $7 mil­lion to char­i­ta­ble causes un­der the Com­mu­nity Chest um­brella. These in­clude causes sup­port­ing chil­dren with spe­cial needs, youth, the dis­abled and the aged.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, Mr Whang sees en­vi­ron­men­tal, gov­er­nance and sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues (ESG is­sues) as the big­gest chal­lenge, and op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“This is the sin­gle big­gest is­sue of the 21st cen­tury, and we need to play our part,” he said. “We have started in­cul­cat­ing the ESG cul­ture in our prod­ucts and man­age­ment.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s ware­houses in Sin­ga­pore, Pe­nang and Shah Alam com­ply with rig­or­ous green stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Lam Soon has also be­gun adopt­ing green pack­ag­ing and is work­ing on re­duc­ing its car­bon foot­print on its dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nels, while its palm oil plan­ta­tions in Malaysia and Thai­land have been RSPO green cer­ti­fied.</p>
    <p>Prod­uct for­mu­la­tions take into ac­count sus­tain­abil­ity and en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues. For ex­am­ple, its tis­sue pa­per is made from re­place­able bam­boo fi­bre, and its de­ter­gents are en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly.</p>
    <p>It is now work­ing on fi­nan­cial sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“There is no grand plan. Our ap­proach is to look at par­tic­u­lar ar­eas and see how we can im­prove.” An­other chal­lenge is tal­ent. Although a scion of the found­ing fam­ily, he sees him­self as an employee-man­ager. He does not have other fam­ily mem­bers in man­age­ment, and leans heav­ily on pro­fes­sional man­agers in the group.</p>
    <p>“Our busi­ness is very lo­calised and con­sol­i­dated in var­i­ous mar­kets. Our bal­ance sheets are also lo­cal. So I would call our­selves a multi-lo­cal com­pany. This has helped us re­main strong and re­silient when Covid-19 forced bor­ders to close.”</p>
    <p>Lam Soon com­pa­nies in var­i­ous mar­kets are co-owned by lo­cal share­hold­ers in the coun­try. So whither the fu­ture?</p>
    <p>“Covid has re­in­forced the fact that FMCG (fast mov­ing con­sumer goods) is a ba­sic and crit­i­cal ne­ces­sity. So we’re in a very good space and we want to deepen this space.</p>
    <p>“As I said be­fore, we are here to pro­vide a re­as­sur­ing pres­ence to a very dis­rupted so­ci­ety. We will con­tinue de­liv­er­ing com­fort­ing and re­as­sur­ing brands to peo­ple.”</p>
