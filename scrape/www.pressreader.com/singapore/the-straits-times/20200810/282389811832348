    <p>LON­DON • Kenya’s Olympic and world 3,000m steeplecha­se cham­pion Cons­es­lus Kipruto has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus and will miss the sea­son-open­ing Di­a­mond League meet­ing in Monaco on Friday.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old, whose per­sonal best is 8min 0.12sec, re­vealed his dis­ap­point­ment as he had been in great shape ahead of the event and was primed to bet­ter the world record, set 16 years ago by Kenyan­born Qatari Saif Saaeed Sha­heen (7:53.63).</p>
    <p>“Our world is go­ing through a chal­leng­ing pe­riod and we all have to take our re­spon­si­bil­i­ties,” Kipruto, who was granted a spe­cial visa to travel to the prin­ci­pal­ity as his coun­try re­mains on a travel black­list, said on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, my Covid-19 test, as part of the Monaco-pro­to­col, came back pos­i­tive and there­fore I can’t be part of the Monaco Di­a­mond League on Aug 14.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have any symp­toms and I was ac­tu­ally in great shape. I was plan­ning to go for the world record. It has stayed too long out­side Kenya.”</p>
    <p>The Monaco Di­a­mond League meet­ing will be fol­lowed by events in Stock­holm, Lau­sanne, Brus­sels, Rome/Naples, Doha and a yet to be de­ter­mined lo­ca­tion in China.</p>
    <p>Meet­ings in Eu­gene in Ore­gon state in the US, Lon­don, Paris, Ra­bat, Gateshead in Eng­land and Shang­hai have been can­celled ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Kipruto was not the only high­pro­file ath­lete to be in­fected by the virus over the week­end af­ter the Sports Author­ity of In­dia re­vealed that five na­tional hockey play­ers, in­clud­ing their cap­tain Man­preet Singh, were quar­an­tined fol­low­ing pos­i­tive tests con­ducted at the team’s train­ing base in Ben­galuru.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial state­ment by the world’s fourth-ranked team read: “The quar­an­tined ath­letes did not in­ter­act with other ath­letes who were al­ready present at the camp... few test results are still awaited.”</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy that they made the test­ing of ath­letes manda­tory,” Man­preet, 28, added.</p>
    <p>“That proac­tive step helped in iden­ti­fy­ing the prob­lem right in time. I am do­ing fine and hope to re­cover very soon.”</p>
    <p>The global health cri­sis is con­tin­u­ing to dis­rupt ath­letes’ train­ing in In­dia, the worst-hit coun­try in Asia where Covid-19 cases have topped 2.1 mil­lion. A train­ing camp on the out­skirts of Delhi for its elite shoot­ers – their best hope for a gold medal at next year’s post­poned Tokyo Olympic Games – was re­cently axed.</p>
