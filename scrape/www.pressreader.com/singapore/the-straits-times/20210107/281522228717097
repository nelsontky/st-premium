    <p>About 40 per cent of sex­ual as­sault cases re­ported to the po­lice from 2017 to 2019 in­volved vic­tims below the age of 16.</p>
    <p>In those three years, there were 6,988 re­ports of sex­ual as­sault, in­clud­ing rape, sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion, out­rage of mod­esty and sex­ual of­fences in­volv­ing chil­dren and vul­ner­a­ble vic­tims, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In these cases, 2,798 vic­tims were younger than 16, and 1,000 vic­tims were be­tween 16 and 20 years old.</p>
    <p>An­other 3,685 vic­tims were aged 21 and older, while 390 vic­tims were em­ployed as for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of vic­tims does not tally with the to­tal num­ber of cases as a case could in­volve more than one vic­tim, or a vic­tim could be in­volved in more than one case.</p>
    <p>Of all the re­ports made, 1,368 cases re­sulted in pros­e­cu­tions, with 931 con­vic­tions to date.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam gave these fig­ures in a writ­ten re­sponse to par­lia­men­tary ques­tions filed by Ms Raeesah Khan and Ms He Ting Ru, who are both MPs for Sengkang GRC. They had asked for sta­tis­tics re­lated to sex­ual as­sault cases, in­clud­ing the age profile of vic­tims, the proportion of re­peat of­fend­ers and the nature of re­la­tion­ships among those in­volved.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the ma­jor­ity of cases – 2,957 out of 6,988 – were be­tween strangers, fol­lowed by 2,243 cases be­tween friends.</p>
    <p>An­other 619 cases were be­tween col­leagues, in­clud­ing su­per­vi­sors and sub­or­di­nates, and 47 in­volved pro­fes­sion­als and clients.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 599 cases were be­tween rel­a­tives, in­clud­ing non-bi­o­log­i­cal ones, and 109 in­volved teach­ers and stu­dents. Teach­ers in­clude tu­tors, coaches and re­lated roles.</p>
    <p>An­other 414 cases oc­curred be­tween peo­ple with other types of re­la­tion­ship, such as neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam also said that from 2005 to 2019, a to­tal of 4,606 of­fend­ers were con­victed of sex­ual as­sault of­fences.</p>
    <p>Of these, 1,364 of­fend­ers had pre­vi­ously been con­victed of sex­ual as­sault of­fences and an­other 1,078 of other of­fences.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Ms Raeesah, Mr Shan­mugam said his min­istry does not track the use of al­co­hol and drugs or the preva­lence and di­ag­no­sis of psy­chi­atric con­di­tions, in re­la­tion to sex­ual as­sault of­fend­ers.</p>
