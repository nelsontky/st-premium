    <p>As Covid-19 in­fec­tions spiked and peo­ple hun­kered down in their homes in March, Ms Sen­thama­rai V. Subra­ma­niam, 38, lost her job as a night mar­ket sales as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>She is the sole bread­win­ner of her fam­ily while her hus­band, Mr Sel­vam Tang­garaju, 42, is the pri­mary care­giver to their four chil­dren, aged five to 13. The cou­ple’s el­dest son suf­fers from high-risk asthma.</p>
    <p>De­spite the chal­lenges brought on by the pan­demic, the cou­ple per­se­vered, set­ting up a home-based busi­ness sell­ing masks, chil­dren’s clothes and cook­ies in their tworoom pub­lic rental flat in Hougang.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the fam­ily was a ben­e­fi­ciary of the Sin­ga­pore In­dian De­vel­op­ment As­so­ci­a­tion’s (Sinda) an­nual Back To School Fes­ti­val (BTSF), which gives out school kits with vouch­ers to un­der­priv­i­leged stu­dents to help them pre­pare for the new aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Sen­thama­rai: “My older chil­dren have been re­ceiv­ing BTSF school kits for a few years now. When Covid-19 struck, our fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion wors­ened and I was wor­ried that I would not be able to cater to their needs. It is a re­lief to know that even in the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, I can rely on Sinda’s help to ease my fi­nan­cial ex­penses and en­sure my chil­dren are pre­pared for school next year.”</p>
    <p>The kits, which have $180 worth of vouch­ers – $120 in sta­tionery/ book vouch­ers and $60 in shoe vouch­ers – are ex­pected to help 3,500 stu­dents in the new aca­demic year.</p>
    <p>Due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, stu­dents and fam­i­lies have been as­signed spe­cific days and time slots to visit Sinda and col­lect their BTSF kits. The ini­tia­tive runs till Nov 30.</p>
    <p>While cur­rently man­ag­ing her home-based busi­ness, Ms Sen­thama­rai said she is hunt­ing for a job that would pro­vide her with a reg­u­lar in­come. She be­came the sole earner in her fam­ily five years ago, when her hus­band left the work­force to be­come their chil­dren’s care­giver.</p>
    <p>Ms Sen­thama­rai is a client of the Sinda Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre. Her two older chil­dren tap the Sinda bur­sary while her third child is a ben­e­fi­ciary of The Straits Times</p>
    <p>School Pocket Money Fund.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily also re­ceives ComCare as­sis­tance. “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when the chil­dren had home-based learn­ing, I was scared</p>
    <p>to take my son out to a pub­lic space so he could ac­cess a lap­top. Be­cause of his asthma, he is at a higher risk of get­ting sick. We were able to get a lap­top from Sinda which helped him study at home,” she said.</p>
    <p>Launch­ing the ini­tia­tive this year, Sinda pres­i­dent In­dra­nee Ra­jah, who is Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, said that even against the back­drop of Covid-19, no stu­dent’s learn­ing or ed­u­ca­tion should be com­pro­mised. “Covid-19 has brought about chal­lenges – some fam­i­lies needed fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance, stu­dents needed de­vices for home­based learn­ing, and some par­ents had to stay home to care for their chil­dren. To as­sist such fam­i­lies, Sinda has deep­ened and en­hanced its sup­port for the In­dian com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>A to­tal of $630,000 will be dis­trib­uted to re­cip­i­ents through this year’s BTSF.</p>
