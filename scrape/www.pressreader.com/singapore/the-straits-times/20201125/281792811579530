    <p>SHANG­HAI • Hun­dreds of flights at one of China’s busiest air­ports were can­celled yes­ter­day as Shang­hai raced to bring a lo­cal Covid-19 out­break un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of staff at Pudong In­ter­na­tional Air­port have been tested since a small clus­ter of Covid-19 cases in the city was linked to sev­eral cargo han­dlers.</p>
    <p>China – where the virus first emerged late l ast year – has largely brought in­fec­tions un­der con­trol through travel re­stric­tions and lock­downs, but it is now bat­tling a num­ber of do­mes­tic out­breaks in dif­fer­ent cities.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai has re­ported seven lo­cal in­fec­tions linked to the air­port this month, with most cases found in the past few days.</p>
    <p>The new out­break has sparked plans to give high-risk work­ers at the travel hub an ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine that China has al­ready been pro­vid­ing to state em­ploy­ees, in­ter­na­tional stu­dents and es­sen­tial work­ers head­ing abroad since July.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, fig­ures from data ser­vices firm Var­iF­light showed that more than 500 flights out of the Pudong air­port had been called off – nearly half the day’s sched­uled flights.</p>
    <p>And al­most half of sched­uled in­bound flights were can­celled.</p>
    <p>More than 17,700 peo­ple had been swabbed by Mon­day morn­ing as part of a drive to test air­port cargo staff, state news agency Xin­hua re­ported. Those in­fected in­cluded em­ploy­ees at lo­gis­tics firms FedEx and UPS.</p>
    <p>Nearly half of all sched­uled flights were also can­celled at the in­ter­na­tional air­port in Tian­jin, a north­ern port city which is test­ing about 2.6 mil­lion peo­ple to try to bring an out­break un­der con­trol. The city re­ported five lo­cal cases last Satur­day and another yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>China has been rolling out var­i­ous mass-screen­ing cam­paigns. The fo­cus has shifted in re­cent days to frozen food and other in­bound ship­ments, which have been blamed for a resur­gence of lo­cal in­fec­tions.</p>
