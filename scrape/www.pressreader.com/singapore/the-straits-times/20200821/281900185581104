    <p>Ne­go­tia­tors from Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union are meet­ing through­out this week in an­other at­tempt to bridge their dif­fer­ences over the adop­tion of an agree­ment gov­ern­ing their fu­ture re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Time is short; with Bri­tain al­ready out of the EU, a deal has to be in place be­fore the end of this year, when the cur­rent tran­si­tion ar­range­ments ex­pire, or trade links be­tween Bri­tain and the rest of Europe will be se­verely dis­rupted. And most of the key con­tentious trade ques­tions have not even been ad­dressed, let alone set­tled.</p>
    <p>Not much progress is ex­pected this week ei­ther. For al­though Bri­tain’s chief EU ne­go­tia­tor David Frost, who is in Brus­sels with about 50 of his of­fi­cials to ex­am­ine the en­tire gamut of re­la­tions with Europe, re­mains op­ti­mistic and claims that “a deal can still be reached in Septem­ber”, both sides ap­pear to be stuck in their mu­tu­ally ir­rec­on­cil­able po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Still, away from the diplo­matic lime­light, the bare bones of a po­ten­tial fu­ture com­pro­mise are be­gin­ning to emerge.</p>
    <p>There are two ma­jor ob­sta­cles to strik­ing a trade deal be­tween Lon­don and Brus­sels. The first is the ques­tion of what ac­cess EU-flagged ships would have to Bri­tain’s fish-rich waters, a par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant point for fish­er­men in France and Spain.</p>
    <p>And then there is the ques­tion of what EU ne­go­tia­tors call the “level play­ing com­pet­i­tive field”, which is the idea that if Bri­tain wants to en­joy free trade with the union, it must un­der­take to re­spect the same in­vest­ment and labour reg­u­la­tions as the EU, so as not to un­der­cut Euro­pean man­u­fac­tur­ers and traders.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean ne­go­tia­tors are in­sist­ing that Bri­tain’s waters should re­main open to EU fish­er­men with no re­stric­tions, not­with­stand­ing the fact that the Bri­tish are no longer an EU mem­ber state.</p>
    <p>The EU is also in­sist­ing that the Euro­pean Court of Jus­tice, the union’s higher court, should be given pow­ers to de­cide on any fu­ture trade dis­putes with Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, the Bri­tish re­ject both propo­si­tions out of hand.</p>
    <p>In pub­lic, EU chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier has ac­cused Bri­tain this week of not show­ing a “will­ing­ness to break the dead­lock” on these is­sues, which he claims are “at the heart” of the EU’s trade in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>In pri­vate, how­ever, Euro­pean ne­go­tia­tors have al­ready qui­etly shelved their orig­i­nal de­mand to have un­fet­tered ac­cess to Bri­tish fish­ing grounds. Fu­ture fish­ing quo­tas are yet to be agreed, but a dis­pute over fish is no longer an in­sur­mount­able ob­sta­cle.</p>
    <p>The EU also ap­pears to have ac­cepted that its Court of Jus­tice won’t be the chief ar­biter in fu­ture trade dis­putes, and that a sep­a­rate tri­bunal will be es­tab­lished for this pur­pose, thereby meet­ing a Bri­tish ar­gu­ment that Bri­tain can­not be held ac­count­able to an EU in­sti­tu­tion over whose pow­ers it has no con­trol, since it is no longer a mem­ber of the union.</p>
    <p>And in re­turn, the Bri­tish have aban­doned their ini­tial in­sis­tence that each sec­tor of their trade re­la­tion­ship with the EU should be sub­ject to sep­a­rate deals. The “salami slic­ing” at­tempt by Lon­don was deeply re­sented in Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is whether this is enough to pro­vide ne­go­tia­tors with the nec­es­sary in­struc­tions to draft the text of a deal.</p>
    <p>Since the 27 EU mem­ber states will have to rat­ify an agree­ment separately through their own na­tional Par­lia­ments, the as­sump­tion is that, if the text of the treaty with Bri­tain is not ready by mid-Oc­to­ber when a EU sum­mit is sched­uled, no free trade ar­range­ment will be in place by</p>
    <p>Dec 31.</p>
    <p>And in the ab­sence of such a new treaty, con­sumers in both Bri­tain and Europe will face the au­to­matic re­turn of trade tar­iffs and quo­tas for the first time in al­most half a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>But even if Mr Frost can strike a bar­gain with his EU coun­ter­part, Mr Barnier, it is al­ready ev­i­dent that a new agree­ment will not pre­serve the old trade ar­range­ments, and that ex­pec­ta­tions are be­ing low­ered on both sides.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal deal, if struck, “will lead to a much harder and more dis­rup­tive Brexit than most</p>
    <p>Bri­tons imag­ine”, Mr Charles Grant, who runs the Cen­tre for Euro­pean Re­form, a think-tank based in Lon­don, warned in a re­cent study.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers on both sides of the bor­der, he pre­dicts, will suf­fer fric­tion at the bor­der, ser­vice firms will be barred from the EU’s sin­gle mar­ket and Bri­tish em­ploy­ers are al­ready en­coun­ter­ing new im­mi­gra­tion con­trols that re­strict their abil­ity to hire work­ers.</p>
    <p>So much for the ini­tial prom­ise made by some Bri­tish politi­cians that their coun­try’s de­par­ture from the EU will not af­fect Bri­tain’s trad­ing po­si­tion.</p>
