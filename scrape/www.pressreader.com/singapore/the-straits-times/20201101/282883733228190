    <p>Like many among the young, Ms Ch­ern Hui Ying, 23, fears she has lit­tle con­trol over her fu­ture. Not in th­ese times of un­cer­tainty and in an econ­omy crip­pled by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But she aims to calm her fears and hedge against po­ten­tial health scares with a plan that gives her the fi­nan­cial flex­i­bil­ity to man­age her cur­rent life stage needs.</p>
    <p>As a fresh grad­u­ate en­ter­ing a weak­en­ing jobs mar­ket, she de­cided to buy an in­vest­ment-linked plan (ILP) be­cause it of­fers her life in­sur­ance at af­ford­able pre­mi­ums with the op­tion to grow her sav­ings through in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“Pur­chas­ing an ILP was for the main pur­pose of be­ing cov­ered, but know­ing that I have the op­tion to ad­just the cov­er­age or con­vert it to in­vest­ment af­ter age 55 is as­sur­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­ern grad­u­ated with a de­gree in psy­chol­ogy and me­dia an­a­lyt­ics from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>In May, she se­cured a one-year trainee­ship with Sin­ga­pore Sport In­sti­tute as part of the SGUnited Trainee­ship Pro­gramme, which of­fers fresh grad­u­ates train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to build their net­work , skills and re­sumes, while they look for a per­ma­nent po­si­tion at the end of the trainee­ship.</p>
    <p>She pays for the plan with her monthly train­ing al­lowance, which she de­clined to dis­close.</p>
    <p>ILPs are es­sen­tially com­pre­hen­sive whole life in­sur­ance plans that give pol­i­cy­hold­ers the flex­i­bil­ity of in­vest­ment re­turns.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can ad­just their cov­er­age when their needs change at dif­fer­ent life stages. Those just start­ing out can opt for ba­sic pro­tec­tion cov­er­age first and grad­u­ally in­crease their cov­er­age based on their pro­tec­tion needs.</p>
    <p>ILP pol­i­cy­hold­ers can also opt to al­lo­cate more pre­mi­ums to in­vest­ments if they want to grow their wealth.</p>
    <p>Take, for in­stance, Great Eastern’s GREAT Life Ad­van­tage II. The reg­u­lar pre­mium ILP lets pol­i­cy­hold­ers in­crease their cov­er­age with no med­i­cal as­sess­ment at any of eight milestones, in­clud­ing their third pol­icy an­niver­sary, mar­riage and birth of their first child.</p>
    <p>“The plan is most ap­pro­pri­ate for my life stage be­cause I’m just start­ing out in my ca­reer and want to be cov­ered for the fu­ture, come what may,” says Ms Ch­ern.</p>
    <p>By adding a crit­i­cal ill­ness rider to the ILP, she gets ad­di­tional cov­er­age against 120 crit­i­cal ill­ness con­di­tions across dif­fer­ent stages.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that I will reap the ben­e­fits in the long term. Hav­ing this plan makes me feel more se­cure about the fu­ture as I know that my fam­ily is pro­tected from large med­i­cal bills if I de­velop a crit­i­cal ill­ness or suf­fer a per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­ern lives with her par­ents — a lec­turer and per­sonal as­sis­tant — and younger brother in a three-room apart­ment in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>She says that the plan’s ben­e­fits and af­ford­able pre­mi­ums, start­ing from as low as $100 a month, helps. “It’s an af­ford­able plan to get you started. This is im­por­tant for young pro­fes­sion­als, like me, and fam­i­lies with young chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>Aside from pay­ing for in­sur­ance, her train­ing al­lowance also goes to­wards fund­ing her fur­ther stud­ies. In Septem­ber, she en­rolled in a mas­ter ’s pro­gramme in coun­selling.</p>
    <p>To spread out the cost of pay­ing for in­sur­ance, Ms Ch­ern is look­ing to switch to monthly pre­mium pay­ments. She is now pay­ing for her pre­mi­ums yearly.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Ch­ern, Great Eastern ILP pol­i­cy­hold­ers have the op­tion of pay­ing their pre­mi­ums on a monthly, quar­terly, bian­nual or an­nual ba­sis.</p>
    <p>If they are un­able to pay the pre­mium, the pol­icy re­mains in force as long as they have enough funds in their plan to cover the pol­icy charges and cost of in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­hold­ers can also choose to in­vest in a range of ILP sub-funds of­fered.</p>
    <p>Other types of in­sur­ance plans such as a term life plan, which pro­vides cov­er­age for a cer­tain pe­riod with no cash value, or a par­tic­i­pat­ing pol­icy such as a whole life plan, which lets you share the prof­its of the in­sur­ance com­pany, do not of­fer the same op­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Ch­ern adds: “Hav­ing this op­tion al­lows me to be in con­trol of the de­ci­sions I make. It helps me to feel more se­cure amid an eco­nomic re­ces­sion and pan­demic.”</p>
