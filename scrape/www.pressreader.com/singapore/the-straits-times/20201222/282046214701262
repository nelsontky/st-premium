    <p>Mr An­drew Tan Chye Hee (Time to work on clean­li­ness, hy­giene stan­dards of hawker cen­tres, Dec 18) and Mr Paul Chan Poh Hoi (Three predica­ments faced by the hawker trade, Dec 18) shared their con­cerns on the state of hy­giene at hawker cen­tres, and wor­ried about how to at­tract tourists to pa­tro­n­ise our food cen­tres should the present sit­u­a­tion re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, tourists were usu­ally brought by guides to se­lected hawker cen­tres such as the New­ton, Chi­na­town Com­plex and Maxwell food cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing said that, good hy­giene stan­dards must be ob­served re­gard­less of whether a hawker cen­tre is lo­cated at a tourist spot or in the heart­land.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve Maxwell Food Cen­tre, which I visit weekly, is the clean­est hawker cen­tre in Sin­ga­pore. The clean­li­ness of its en­tire premises, in­clud­ing its wash­rooms, is highly laud­able.</p>
    <p>The ta­bles and seats at the food cen­tre are cleaned once a diner fin­ishes his food and leaves the ta­ble; the cleaner im­me­di­ately moves in to clear and sani­tise the ta­bles and seats. Clean­ers are de­ployed to take charge of each sec­tion. Its wash­rooms are washed round the clock.</p>
    <p>De­spite not be­ing a new hawker cen­tre, Maxwell Food Cen­tre is a good ex­am­ple for other hawker cen­tres to fol­low.</p>
    <p>Also, peo­ple tend to con­cen­trate on the un­hy­gienic con­di­tions that are ap­par­ent, such as left­over food, used tis­sues and dirty crock­ery left all over the ta­bles, but what about hawk­ers’ per­sonal hy­giene and clean­li­ness of food han­dling, which are less vis­i­ble?</p>
    <p>I fre­quently see stall­hold­ers us­ing their bare hands to op­er­ate their phones, scratch their bod­ies or wipe away sweat, then pro­ceed to pre­pare food for cus­tomers with­out first wash­ing their hands.</p>
