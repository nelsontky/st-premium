    <p>Amer­i­can pol­i­tics is at a volatile stage. Nine days be­fore United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump leaves of­fice, moves are afoot to im­peach him. It would take a sim­ple ma­jor­ity in the House that Speaker Nancy Pelosi con­trols to press a charge – cen­tred around Mr Trump in­cit­ing an in­sur­rec­tion and mak­ing him the first pres­i­dent in US his­tory to be im­peached twice. But, as was the case dur­ing Mr Trump’s im­peach­ment last year, the Repub­li­cans in the Se­nate are un­likely to vote in suf­fi­cient num­bers to pro­vide a two-thirds ma­jor­ity to con­vict and re­move him from of­fice, even if an ex­pe­dited trial was held. Sev­eral mem­bers of Mr Trump’s Cabi­net and some White House of­fi­cials have re­signed, con­demn­ing his role in egging on sup­port­ers to ran­sack the Capi­tol last week. But the de­sire to not anger Mr Trump’s loyal base of mil­lions of vot­ers pre­vents a stronger re­pu­di­a­tion by his Repub­li­can Party.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is, there­fore, well placed to stay in the sad­dle. Mr Mike Pence ap­pears re­luc­tant to sup­port a move to in­voke a con­sti­tu­tional amend­ment de­signed to put the Vice-Pres­i­dent in charge. In­com­ing pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den has in­di­cated that he would rather con­cen­trate on tak­ing charge on Jan 20 than in sup­port­ing moves to oust Mr Trump. Adding to the un­cer­tainty of the hour, se­cu­rity has been tight­ened in an­tic­i­pa­tion of more vi­o­lence in the run-up to Mr Bi­den’s in­au­gu­ra­tion, and Mr Trump has been muz­zled. Twit­ter and Face­book sus­pended his ac­counts – an­other un­prece­dented move – cit­ing his in­flam­ma­tory rhetoric. A few hours be­fore the Jan 6 breach­ing of the Capi­tol, Mr Trump falsely claimed dur­ing a rally that seven states had sub­mit­ted “il­le­git­i­mate” elec­toral vote tal­lies to Congress. A day later, how­ever, Mr Trump for­mally com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing a seam­less tran­si­tion but stopped short of re­cant­ing his claims that the Nov 3 elec­tion had fraud­u­lently de­prived him of vic­tory. The ri­ots last week took five lives and con­vey well the risks when pop­ulism and the pol­i­tics of re­sent­ment, rather than in­formed civic en­gage­ment, come to dom­i­nate na­tional dis­course.</p>
    <p>But there is plenty still to cel­e­brate about the</p>
    <p>US democ­racy. The run-off elec­tion in Ge­or­gia, that handed Mr Bi­den’s party con­trol of the Se­nate, re­sulted in the vic­to­ries of the first AfricanAme­r­i­can and the first Jew from a state that prac­tised ra­cial se­gre­ga­tion un­til about six decades ago. A Demo­cratic Congress will sup­port Mr Bi­den’s in­ter­na­tion­al­ist for­eign pol­icy that prom­ises to re­place Mr Trump’s trans­ac­tional and uni­lat­eral ap­proach. The fran­tic pol­i­tick­ing likely to tran­spire in the last days of the Trump pres­i­dency could let off the bad blood and may as eas­ily ce­ment po­lar­i­sa­tion in the coun­try after a bit­ter elec­tion. It will fall on Mr Bi­den to bridge the wor­ry­ing di­vide and step pur­pose­fully to bring the two di­verg­ing halves of Amer­ica to­gether.</p>
