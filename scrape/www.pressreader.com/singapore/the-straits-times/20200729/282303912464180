    <p>LON­DON • Kevin de Bruyne is hop­ing to crown David Silva’s glo­ri­ous 10 years at Manch­ester City by com­plet­ing the Spa­niard’s set of medals with a Cham­pi­ons League win next month.</p>
    <p>Silva has won four Premier League ti­tles among 14 tro­phies since join­ing City from Va­len­cia in 2010. He has also won the World Cup and two Euro­pean Cham­pi­onships at in­ter­na­tional level with Spain.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder has never tasted Cham­pi­ons League glory but he has one last chance with Pep Guardiola’s team, with his con­tract end­ing at the end of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>City re­sume their Euro­pean cam­paign at home to Real Madrid on Aug 7. They hold a 2-1 lead from the first leg of their last-16 tie, with the win­ners pro­gress­ing to the quar­ter-fi­nals, which will be held at a neu­tral site in Lis­bon.</p>
    <p>De Bruyne scored twice in Silva’s fi­nal Premier League game as City thrashed Nor­wich 5-0 on Sun­day and la­belled his mid­field part­ner one of the best play­ers to ever play in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>It was Silva’s 214th Premier League match win. He holds the record for fastest player to reach 200 vic­to­ries</p>
    <p>League era.</p>
    <p>“You can al­ways de­bate who is (num­ber) one but when you play with him you can ap­pre­ci­ate what he does day-in, day-out. I have played with him for five years, a long time,” said the Belgian.</p>
    <p>“He is go­ing to be a big miss. It would be great if we could win the Cham­pi­ons League so it could end well for him.”</p>
    <p>City have scored four or more goals in six of their 12 games since English foot­ball’s restart last month and de Bruyne is hop­ing to carry that form onto the Euro­pean stage.</p>
    <p>“It is good to stay in the rhythm. There is no point slack­ing. We have to keep go­ing full pace,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Tele­graph, City are plan­ning to play a closed-door friendly this week­end in prepa­ra­tion for their match against the newly-minted La Liga cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>Guardiola re­vealed he would an­a­lyse Real’s 11 league matches since Span­ish foot­ball re­sumed, only one of which they failed to win, plus games they have played this term with­out cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos, who is sus­pended fol­low­ing his red card in the first leg. Real for­ward Mariin the Premier ano, who was un­likely to face City, has also been ruled out af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the club said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Silva is hop­ing his swan­song will not come against Zine­dine Zi­dane’s men but knows it will soon be time to say good­bye.</p>
    <p>“I could not imag­ine when I came here, to win so many ti­tles and the way we won it,” said the 34-yearold, who has made 434 City ap­pear­ances in all com­pe­ti­tions, scor­ing 77 goals.</p>
    <p>“I have been work­ing with the play­ers and I love all of them. I am go­ing to miss ev­ery­thing – even the weather!”</p>
