    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are see­ing a healthy take-up of jobs and trainee­ships as the fi­nance and in­sur­ance sec­tor is pro­jected to ex­pand this year, de­spite a cli­mate of re­trench­ments and eco­nomic gloom.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank has filled 90 per cent of its 3,000 po­si­tions on of­fer this year, which in­clude 2,100 full-time roles and 900 trainee­ship and in­tern­ship spots.</p>
    <p>In the full-time roles, 60 per cent of hires are ex­pe­ri­enced pro­fes­sion­als, with the rest fresh grad­u­ates. More than half of the ex­pe­ri­enced hires are from non-fi­nance sec­tors.</p>
    <p>About 60 per cent of the trainee­ship and in­tern­ship po­si­tions, in ar­eas such as cor­po­rate banking, data and tech­nol­ogy, have been filled.</p>
    <p>Mr Ernest Phang, OCBC’s head of cor­po­rate ser­vices for group hu­man re­sources, said the bank will con­tinue to hire a mix of fresh grad­u­ates and ex­pe­ri­enced pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Data sci­en­tist Daniel Tan joined the AI Lab at OCBC in June, after a two-month job search. Mr Tan, 32, had worked at a travel tech­nol­ogy com­pany for about three years.</p>
    <p>He had found an­other job be­fore the OCBC one, but was laid off on his sec­ond day there.</p>
    <p>He shared his ex­pe­ri­ence on pro­fes­sional net­work­ing site LinkedIn, where he con­nected with his current su­per­vi­sor, the lab’s head of data sci­ence An­drea Pisoni. Mr Tan said: “Shar­ing my story was one of the best de­ci­sions I’ve made.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, DBS Bank said it is on track to hire 2,000 peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore by the end of the year, al­though it did not spec­ify how many roles have been filled. One thou­sand are ex­ist­ing roles, while the rest are new roles com­pris­ing trainee­ships for fresh grad­u­ates and more spe­cialised roles for sea­soned pro­fes­sion­als, in ar­eas like data sci­ence.</p>
    <p>A DBS spokesman said: “As a key em­ployer in Sin­ga­pore, it seemed right to us to not just con­tinue with hir­ing for busi­ness-as-usual ac­tiv­i­ties but also to ac­tively cre­ate new jobs where we can, to help more peo­ple tide through this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank said it is of­fer­ing 320 trainee­ships in more than 10 busi­ness and sup­port units, un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme and the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme run in</p>
    <p>AC­TIVE CRE­ATION OF NEW JOBS</p>
    <p>part­ner­ship with the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The bank has al­ready taken in more than 100 trainees in roles such as risk and com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>UOB’s head of group hu­man re­sources Dean Tong said trainees who do well are given op­por­tu­ni­ties to take on full-time roles. UOB also of­fers trainees who are re­cent grad­u­ates a fast-track ap­pli­ca­tion process for its re­gional man­age­ment as­so­ci­ate pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Citi Sin­ga­pore said more than 95</p>
    <p>per cent of 76 stu­dents who com­pleted a vir­tual pro­gramme in July have been of­fered full-time roles.</p>
    <p>They will start work when they grad­u­ate next year, fill­ing roles in ar­eas such as con­sumer banking.</p>
    <p>Citi is also of­fer­ing more than 100 po­si­tions in the next few months un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme, said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered Bank – the largest for­eign banking sub­sidiary here, with 10,000 em­ploy­ees – will of­fer close to 350 trainee­ship and ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties this year, but did not say how many have been filled.</p>
    <p>Ms Char­lotte Thng, head of hu­man re­sources for Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia, Asean and South Asia clus­ter mar­kets, said Stan­Chart has com­mit­ted $8 mil­lion in re­cent years to reskill and train its work­force here.</p>
    <p>In the in­sur­ance sec­tor, OCBC’s in­sur­ance arm Great Eastern has hired more than 500 fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives since April as part of on­go­ing hir­ing ef­forts, with 1,000 va­can­cies for agents.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben Tan, Great Eastern’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of re­gional agency, fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory and ban­cas­sur­ance, said it has at­tracted more mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als, with a third of its new fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives be­ing pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and busi­ness­men.</p>
    <p>Re­cent grad­u­ate Vanessa Lim, 23, who stud­ied sport sci­ence and man­age­ment at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, ini­tially wanted to be a po­lice­woman, but changed her mind and joined Great Eastern Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers in April.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who was pro­moted to se­nior fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant in July, said: “Fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties seem to be a prob­lem that many peo­ple leave to fate, but in fact, there is a so­lu­tion which they can plan for.”</p>
    <p>Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore’s chief hu­man re­sources of­fi­cer Sheela Parakkal said more than 100 new em­ploy­ees joined the com­pany in the first half of the year, bring­ing its to­tal staff size to more than 1,300.</p>
    <p>As a key em­ployer in Sin­ga­pore, it seemed right to us to not just con­tinue with hir­ing for busi­ness-as-usual ac­tiv­i­ties but also to ac­tively cre­ate new jobs where we can, to help more peo­ple tide through this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.</p>
