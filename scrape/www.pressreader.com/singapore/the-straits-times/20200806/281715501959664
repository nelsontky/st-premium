    <p>On Mon­day, Dr Anthony Fauci, the US gov­ern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, said states with high Covid-19 case counts should re­con­sider im­pos­ing lock­down re­stric­tions, em­pha­sis­ing the need to get cases to a low base­line be­fore the fall flu sea­son.</p>
    <p>Europe re­mains the hardest-hit re­gion with 211,365 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>France and the Nether­lands im­posed stricter mask-wear­ing rules yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Toulouse in south-west France an­nounced that mask wear­ing was com­pul­sory in par­tic­u­larly busy streets and squares from yes­ter­day. Paris and other cities are ex­pected to fol­low suit soon, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>A sci­en­tific com­mit­tee ad­vis­ing the French gov­ern­ment warned that the coun­try could lose con­trol of its spread “at any time”.</p>
    <p>In the Nether­lands, sim­i­lar maskwear­ing mea­sures came into force in Rot­ter­dam and in some busy neigh­bour­hoods of Am­s­ter­dam, in­clud­ing its fa­mous red-light district.</p>
    <p>Even in parts of the world that ap­peared to have curbed the spread of the virus, coun­tries and ar­eas have re­cently seen sin­gle-day records in new cases, sig­nalling the bat­tle is far from over.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, Ja­pan, Hong Kong, Bo­livia, Su­dan, Ethiopia, Bul­garia, Bel­gium, Uzbek­istan and Is­rael all re­cently had record in­creases in cases.</p>
