    <p>Na­tional wa­ter agency PUB will look into en­hanc­ing treat­ment pro­cesses af­ter some house­holds in Pasir Ris, Yishun and Tampines re­ported on Wed­nes­day that boiled tap wa­ter gave off a pan­dan smell.</p>
    <p>PUB had said this is­sue was traced to wa­ter im­ported from Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Screen­ing tech­nolo­gies at present do not al­low for the de­tec­tion of trace amounts of the or­ganic com­pound tetrahy­dro­fu­ran (THF), which is re­spon­si­ble for the pan­dan­like odour, PUB said on Face­book yes­ter­day. It added that it is work­ing with the Malaysian au­thor­i­ties to iden­tify the source of the THF.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter from Malaysia is treated at PUB’s wa­ter­works in Jo­hor be­fore it ar­rives in Sin­ga­pore, and sim­i­larly strin­gent wa­ter treat­ment and qual­ity mon­i­tor­ing pro­cesses ap­ply, the agency said.</p>
    <p>It said that THF, which is highly sol­u­ble, has a low boil­ing point of 66 deg C. This causes it to va­por­ise upon boil­ing, giv­ing off a dis­tinc­tive flo­ral scent.</p>
    <p>PUB up­dated yes­ter­day that it has com­pleted flush­ing of ser­vice reser­voirs, the transmissi­on and dis­tri­bu­tion net­work and wa­ter tanks to re­move THF traces from the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“The qual­ity of wa­ter sup­ply across the is­land re­mains con­sis­tently within nor­mal and ac­cept­able range. We have also been test­ing in­com­ing wa­ter sup­ply from Jo­hor and are sat­is­fied that it is now of good qual­ity,” it noted, adding that it will no longer pro­vide wa­ter bags to af­fected house­holds as the tap wa­ter is safe for con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>The full re­place­ment of af­fected wa­ter in the net­work means there should no longer be any smell, al­though PUB noted that any “lin­ger­ing” odours are “likely due to rem­nant wa­ter in house pipes”. Cus­tomers are ad­vised to run their taps for five min­utes to elim­i­nate this.</p>
