    <p>The street cats of Sin­ga­pore have been leav­ing their paw prints on the lit­er­ary scene, in­spir­ing two new books, a col­lec­tion of short fic­tion and an in­ter­ga­lac­tic graphic novel by a DC Comics artist.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nity Cat Chron­i­cles, a col­lec­tion by Lach­lan J. Mad­sen and Eleanor Nils­son about a group of cats in a Hous­ing Board es­tate, has spent six weeks on The Straits Times’ best­seller list.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Amer­i­can comic cre­ator Shane Davis has teamed up with his Sin­ga­porean wife Lin Yanzi for graphic novel Starlight Cats #1: Mer­lion Ris­ing, in which a Sin­ga­porean girl helps su­per­pow­ered cats fight aliens.</p>
    <p>Davis, 40, has been work­ing in comics for close to 20 years. He il­lus­trated the graphic novel Su­per­man: Earth One, a New York Times best­seller, and cre­ated Dex-Starr of DC’s Red Lan­tern Corps, a fe­line anti-hero based on his pet cat Dex­ter.</p>
    <p>He and Lin, 36, have been plan­ning Starlight Cats for three years. In it, eight-year-old Re­becca Chow meets a street cat called Barn­aby and joins the cos­micpow­ered Starlight Cats in fight­ing the Verkins, rat-like aliens bent on con­quer­ing Earth. The Mer­lion makes an ap­pear­ance as a de­ity to the cats.</p>
    <p>Davis and Lin – who live in North Carolina, in the United States, with four cats – launched Starlight Cats as a project on fund-rais­ing plat­form Indiegogo on Oct 4, with es­ti­mated de­liv­ery in Au­gust next year. It has since raised more than $56,000 with more than 430 back­ers.</p>
    <p>They say in an e-mail in­ter­view: “We both felt that set­ting the story in Sin­ga­pore was a great fit as Sin­ga­pore is a cos­mopoli­tan, mul­ti­cul­tural mod­ern city. A lot of peo­ple in the US have heard of Sin­ga­pore, but there are very few rep­re­sen­ta­tions of Sin­ga­pore in Amer­i­can pop cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“With Yanzi be­ing a Sin­ga­porean, we felt we could tell a story about a Sin­ga­porean girl and the cul­ture of the street cats with the proper at­ten­tion to de­tail that such a story de­serves.”</p>
    <p>Barn­aby is based on a real cat in Cle­menti, which strolled up to Lin one day, sat at her feet and later al­lowed her to pick it up and carry it home. Her fam­ily has adopted it, though it re­mains very much an out­door cat and con­tin­ues to roam the streets, re­turn­ing daily for food and pet­ting.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nity Cat Chron­i­cles also fic­tion­alises real cats. When Aus­tralian screen­writer and pro­ducer Mad­sen, 51, moved into an HDB flat in Ang Mo Kio in 2012, there was a sil­ver-grey tabby which lived un­der his block and seemed to have full run of the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>The cat went by many names, in­clud­ing Mid­night and Ma­nis (sweet in Malay).</p>
    <p>He told Nils­son – a long-time friend who lives i n Ade­laide, Aus­tralia and is the au­thor of 24 chil­dren’s books – about Ma­nis. Soon, they be­gan cre­at­ing a fic­tional uni­verse around him.</p>
    <p>Ma­nis has since died, but is re­mem­bered in the book, which weaves to­gether sto­ries about the other cats in the com­mu­nity – Mr Bub­bles, Kucinta, Char­lie Chap­lin and so on – all based on real felines in Mad­sen’s neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>It also pays homage to those who look af­ter the cats, from their feed­ers to the mem­bers of the Face­book group Sayang Our Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mu­nity Cats, and de­picts the threat posed by cat abusers.</p>
    <p>Mad­sen says inane-mail in­ter­view that the book’s best­seller sta­tus has been an “un­ex­pected but de­light­ful sur­prise”.</p>
    <p>Books about felines can be cat­nip for the charts – the 2017 English trans­la­tion of Hiro Arikawa’s Ja­panese road trip novel The Trav­el­ling Cat Chron­i­cles has spent more than 90 weeks on The Straits</p>
    <p>I be­lieve com­mu­nity cats in Sin­ga­pore... play an im­por­tant role in the men­tal health of many lonely and el­derly res­i­dents, help­ing give pur­pose to their lives.</p>
    <p>Times’ best­seller list.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, The Com­mu­nity Cat Chron­i­cles counts among its pre­de­ces­sors the 2013 an­thol­ogy From The Belly Of The Cat, edited by Stephanie Ye, with sto­ries such as Wena Poon’s Maruchan, Amanda Lee Koe’s Laun­dro­mat and Joshua Ip’s Robotz At­tackz Teh Citeh.</p>
    <p>Mad­sen hopes such books can bring greater aware­ness of the im­por­tance of cats in the com­mu­nity in Sin­ga­pore, where the keep­ing of cats in HDB flats is banned.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve com­mu­nity cats i n Sin­ga­pore... play an im­por­tant role in the men­tal health of many lonely and el­derly res­i­dents, help­ing give pur­pose to their lives.</p>
    <p>“The cats may get a feed, but as I see them in void decks as sen­tinels on night duty, I can’t help think­ing they are guard­ing sto­ically against the spec­tre of lone­li­ness for some of the two-legged res­i­dents. They look af­ter us, just as we look af­ter them.”</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nity Cat Chron­i­cles ($16) is avail­able at bit.ly/CCatC_MN. From The Belly Of The Cat ($19 be­fore GST) is avail­able from Book­sAc­tu­ally. Starlight Cats #1: Mer­lion Ris­ing can be pre-or­dered at igg.me/at/starlight­cats</p>
    <p>AU­THOR LACH­LAN J. MAD­SEN, on his hopes that books about cats can raise aware­ness of the an­i­mals’ im­por­tance in the com­mu­nity</p>
