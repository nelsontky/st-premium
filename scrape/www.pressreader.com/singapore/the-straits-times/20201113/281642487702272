    <p>The mother and step­fa­ther of a girl were yes­ter­day charged with the 11-year-old’s mur­der.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who are both 26 and can­not be named due to a gag or­der, ap­peared in a dis­trict court via video link, where they were charged with mur­der with com­mon in­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The girl, who was the bi­o­log­i­cal daugh­ter of the woman, was pro­nounced dead on Tues­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Nov 6 and Tues­day, the cou­ple had al­legedly en­gaged in ac­tions that caused the girl’s death at a flat in Jurong, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>In court yes­ter­day, the woman re­quested to see her three sons, and said that she has joint cus­tody of two of them with her former hus­band. As one of her chil­dren is start­ing Pri­mary 1 soon, she re­quested bail so she could pass some rel­e­vant doc­u­ments to her former hus­band.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused man also re­quested to see his son via video link.</p>
    <p>The dis­trict judge told them that no bail was avail­able, but said the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer could as­sist with their re­quests.</p>
    <p>Mar­riage records show that the cou­ple were mar­ried in April this year. The woman’s first mar­riage was in 2013.</p>
    <p>The girl was un­con­scious when taken to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal by am­bu­lance on Tues­day at around 11am, ac­cord­ing to the po­lice. She was pro­nounced dead at 12.40pm.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they were alerted to the un­nat­u­ral death around 1.20pm. Fol­low­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions, they ar­rested the cou­ple over their sus­pected in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple are cur­rently in re­mand, and will be back in court next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of the mur­der charge, the cou­ple face the death penalty.</p>
