    <p>When Ms Fiona Lim and her hus­band Jerry Ng reopened their bak chor mee stall at ABC Brick­works Food Cen­tre in mid-June af­ter a three-month clo­sure, they were not sure if cus­tomers were go­ing to re­turn amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness had dipped by more than 60 per cent while the food cen­tre was un­der­go­ing ren­o­va­tion be­tween March and June, dur­ing which they switched to de­liv­er­ing their dishes through on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>But their fi­nan­cial stress was al­le­vi­ated as they have been given an av­er­age of 40 per cent rental re­bates over 15 months since Oc­to­ber last year, when they joined the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s (NEA) In­cu­ba­tion Stall Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The NEA said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that more than 105 ap­pli­cants have ap­plied to set up hawker stalls since the pro­gramme was</p>
    <p>launched in Fe­bru­ary 2018, of which 28 were suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>Ten are op­er­at­ing in­cu­ba­tion stalls un­der the pro­gramme, while three have be­come full-fledged</p>
    <p>hawk­ers. The re­main­ing 15 have left the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, 30, and Mr Ng, 36, are among the 10 stall­hold­ers who have stayed the course since they joined</p>
    <p>the pro­gramme last year.</p>
    <p>“We were able to save up to $4,000 in start-up costs and forked out the re­main­ing $8,000 on our own. The rental re­bates helped us greatly in re­duc­ing our fi­nan­cial stress be­cause cus­tomer walk-ins were weak in the first few months and we needed time to pro­mote our stall to peo­ple,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>“The re­bates are also help­ing us to cope now as we are re­cov­er­ing from the ef­fects of Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the In­cu­ba­tion Stall Pro­gramme, as­pir­ing hawk­ers are given a 50 per cent rental re­bate for the first nine months, fol­lowed by a 25 per cent rental re­bate for the next six months. Their stalls also come with ba­sic equip­ment like stain­less steel shelves, work­tops, fridges, a dis­play shelf and sinks.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble, ap­pli­cants must have at­tended ei­ther the In­tro­duc­tion to Manag­ing a Hawker Busi­ness course run by the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion or a sim­i­lar course, or be a grad­u­ate of a busi­ness man­age­ment course of­fered at a ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>They must also present a busi­ness plan and un­dergo a food tast­ing panel assessment.</p>
    <p>On top of cook­ing bak chor mee six days a week, Mr Ng also works part-time as an in­surance agent, while Ms Lim mainly man­ages on­line or­ders and makes the de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have two young chil­dren aged one and four years old.</p>
    <p>“When we first opened the stall, I would bring my son – who was six months old at that time – with me in a baby car­rier so I could help run the stall and take care of him. We are lucky to have help­ful hawker neigh­bours who will help to play with him when we are busy,” Ms Lim said.</p>
