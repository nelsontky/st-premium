    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh yes­ter­day con­grat­u­lated Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan ChuanJin on his re-elec­tion, and said that he gave WP MPs ap­pro­pri­ate time to en­gage the Govern­ment on the is­sues that mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“We trust that you will con­tinue in the same vein,” Mr Singh added in his first speech in Par­lia­ment as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on be­half of nine other WP MPs and two Progress Sin­ga­pore Party Non-Con­stituency MPs, he pledged to con­tinue to sup­port Mr Tan’s ef­forts in rais­ing the es­teem of Par­lia­ment and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He also urged Mr Tan to lend sup­port to a sug­ges­tion he made in 2016, for the Govern­ment to con­sider set­ting up more par­lia­men­tary se­lect com­mit­tees, such as on key is­sues like pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>This would de­mys­tify the work of Par­lia­ment, a cen­tral pil­lar of Sin­ga­pore’s sys­tem of govern­ment, and make pol­i­tics more ac­count­able and poli­cies bet­ter, he said.</p>
    <p>In turn, it would help Sin­ga­pore­ans to bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate law-making and de­bates on pol­icy im­per­a­tives and trade-offs, he added.</p>
    <p>“Par­lia­ment’s di­rect and in­di­rect im­pact on each and every Sin­ga­porean and our busi­nesses is mas­sive, and it is only ap­pro­pri­ate that we am­plify the choices and the rea­sons be­hind the de­ci­sions made or not made in Par­lia­ment more widely,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In do­ing so, I hope Sin­ga­pore­ans are in turn driven to un­der­stand the is­sues we de­bate deeply, but al­ways in the con­text of a small and mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety which has to balance and ac­com­mo­date many dif­fer­ent view­points and shift­ing norms.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said Mr Tan has sought to in­crease pub­lic aware­ness of the work of Par­lia­ment since as­sum­ing the Speaker’s role in 2017, such as through in­creased use of so­cial me­dia, with­out com­pro­mis­ing on the for­mal­ity and se­ri­ous pur­pose of Par­lia­ment. “In do­ing so, you have en­cour­aged Sin­ga­pore­ans to take an ac­tive in­ter­est in Par­lia­ment as an or­gan of state that is fun­da­men­tal to our democ­racy,” he added.</p>
    <p>Another thing Mr Tan has done is to take an ac­tive in­ter­est in en­gag­ing the par­lia­men­tar­i­ans of Sin­ga­pore’s clos­est neigh­bours, tak­ing del­e­ga­tions on vis­its to the Par­lia­ments of Malaysia and In­done­sia, said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>“In­deed, as this gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans tra­verses a more volatile, un­cer­tain, com­plex and am­bigu­ous world than be­fore, we would be re­miss to ig­nore our clos­est neigh­bours and the con­text of Sin­ga­pore’s place in our neigh­bour­hood and the wider world.”</p>
    <p>He re­counted how, dur­ing a courtesy visit to the De­wan Rakyat – Malaysia’s Lower House of Par­lia­ment – in March last year, a Malaysian MP had asked Mr Tan for his ad­vice on the re­moval of an MP, which was be­ing fiercely de­bated at that sit­ting.</p>
    <p>“I do not think it was a co­in­ci­dence that another Malaysian MP stood up and in­vited the De­wan Rakyat to seek your ad­vice from the</p>
