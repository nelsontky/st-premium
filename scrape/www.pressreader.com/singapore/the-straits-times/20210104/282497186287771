    <p>PARIS • New Paris Saint-Ger­main man­ager Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino is rel­ish­ing the op­por­tu­nity to take charge of a star-stud­ded squad but has warned the club’s top play­ers that they must prove they de­serve to wear the jersey of the French tre­ble win­ners.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Tot­ten­ham boss was named head coach of PSG on Satur­day, re­plac­ing Thomas Tuchel, who was sacked on Christ­mas Eve, re­port­edly for com­ments in an in­ter­view with Ger­man me­dia that was viewed as crit­i­cal of the Qatari own­ers.</p>
    <p>This will be Po­chet­tino’s big­gest job. At Es­panyol, Southamp­ton and Spurs, he was tasked to build from the ground up with em­pha­sis on bring­ing young play­ers through. But at PSG, he has a ready-made team who are gun­ning for the club’s maiden Cham­pi­ons League tro­phy. But the 48-yearold, who has signed a deal un­til next June, is look­ing for­ward to the chal­lenge of get­ting ev­ery­one to pull in the same di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>“In this club, it’s al­ways been about ex­cel­lence, the play­ers have to de­serve to wear the j ersey,” Po­chet­tino, who played at Parc des Princes from 2001 to 2003 and also cap­tained the side, said.</p>
    <p>Since the 2011 takeover, PSG have been French foot­ball’s dom­i­nant side but they have yet to cross that fi­nal hur­dle in Europe, with the Ligue 1 side of­ten ac­cused of play­ing more like in­di­vid­u­als than</p>
    <p>a team. Po­chet­tino’s pre­de­ces­sors, like Unai Emery, also had prob­lems han­dling the many dress­ing room egos but the Ar­gen­tinian is un­per­turbed.</p>
    <p>“I think that it’s a fan­tas­tic squad and I think that we can ac­com­plish what this club and the play­ers want be­cause they are com­peti­tors and they want to lift tro­phies,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Our main goal is to make sure ev­ery­one is head­ing in the same di­rec­tion. The idea is for ev­ery­one to want to win for the club more than any­thing else. We want to be a strong club with a strong struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“PSG are one of the big­gest clubs in the world. So it’s not only im­por­tant to win but to win with style.”</p>
    <p>Po­chet­tino yes­ter­day took</p>
    <p>charge of his first train­ing ses­sion ahead of his maiden game in charge, a league trip to Saint-Eti­enne on Wednesday when the league re­sumes fol­low­ing the win­ter break. With the Cham­pi­ons League knock­out phase not un­til next month, his first pri­or­ity would be to re-es­tab­lish a com­mand­ing lead in the league.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle race is tight this term, with PSG in third place, just a point be­hind lead­ers Lyon (36). In the past five sea­sons, PSG have won the cham­pi­onship at a can­ter.</p>
    <p>Po­chet­tino’s first ma­jor test will be the Cham­pi­ons League last-16 tie against Barcelona next month. Only glory in Europe will do for last sea­son’s fi­nal­ists, given the huge sums the Qatari own­ers have spent</p>
    <p>to be­come foot­ball’s sec­ond bil­lion-dol­lar team.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Po­chet­tino, who led Spurs to the Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal in 2019, is ex­pected to aug­ment the side. There are ru­mours sug­gest­ing Crys­tal Palace’s Wil­fried Zaha and Spurs duo Dele Alli (left) and Hugo Lloris are trans­fer tar­gets this month, while Barcelona skip­per Lionel Messi will be top of the list should he leave on a free trans­fer at the end of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>In the longer term, Po­chet­tino also has to con­vince Ney­mar and Kylian Mbappe their fu­ture lies in Paris – their cur­rent deals end next year so the club may be forced to sell the star pair in the sum­mer to avoid los­ing them for noth­ing if they snub new of­fers.</p>
    <p>PSG are one of the big­gest clubs in the world. So it’s not only im­por­tant to win but to win with style.</p>
    <p>MAURI­CIO PO­CHET­TINO, PSG man­ager, on bring­ing his high-press­ing, at­tack­ing brand of foot­ball to the Parc des Princes.</p>
