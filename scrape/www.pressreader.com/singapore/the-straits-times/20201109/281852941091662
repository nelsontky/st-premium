    <p>BRUS­SELS • The Euro­pean Union and Bri­tain have said ma­jor di­ver­gences re­main but that post-Brexit ne­go­ti­a­tions would con­tinue this week to clinch a trade deal in the scant time left.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a phone call with Mr Boris John­son, Euro­pean Com­mis­sion chief Ur­sula von der Leyen said the dif­fer­ences were “large”, while the Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter de­scribed them as “sig­nif­i­cant”.</p>
    <p>EU ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier said he would head back to London to re­sume talks with his Bri­tish coun­ter­part David Frost.</p>
    <p>De­spite mul­ti­ple rounds of talks, in­clud­ing two weeks of “in­tense” meet­ings that ended last Wed­nes­day, the sides re­main far apart on fish­ing rights and rules for com­pe­ti­tion be­tween Bri­tish and Euro­pean com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Some progress has been made, but large dif­fer­ences re­main es­pe­cially on level play­ing field and fish­eries. Our teams will con­tinue work­ing hard next week,” Ms von der Leyen tweeted last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said the ne­go­ti­at­ing teams would re­con­vene in London today, “in or­der to re­dou­ble ef­forts to reach a deal”, ac­cord­ing to a Down­ing Street spokesman.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son “set out that, while some progress had been made in re­cent dis­cus­sions, sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ences re­main in a num­ber of ar­eas, in­clud­ing the so-called level play­ing field and fish”, he said.</p>
    <p>Both lead­ers agreed to re­main in per­sonal con­tact as well, sig­nalling a stepped-up po­lit­i­cal ef­fort to se­cure a new trad­ing part­ner­ship be­fore Bri­tain ends a post-Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Be­fore then, sev­eral weeks are needed for any treaty to be vet­ted and rat­i­fied by both sides, and ob­servers have said they will be cut­ting it very fine if agree­ment is not reached by mid-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>RED LINES</p>
    <p>Both sides had warned ear­lier in the year that a draft deal should be ready be­fore end-Oc­to­ber if it is to be rat­i­fied by the EU and Bri­tish Par­lia­ments be­fore the end of the year. But the talks blew past this un­of­fi­cial dead­line, and Bri­tain could yet leave the EU sin­gle mar­ket and Cus­toms union at mid­night on Dec 31 with no follow-on frame­work for cross-Chan­nel busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Although both sides say they would pre­fer to avoid the eco­nomic dis­rup­tion this would en­tail, they in­sist they are ready if it comes to that, and nei­ther is yet ready to cross their red lines.</p>
    <p>For Bri­tain, this means re­assert­ing sovereignt­y over its fish­ing wa­ters. The EU says it wants a “fair deal” that gives ac­cess for boats from the bloc’s mem­ber states like France and the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>Mr Barnier said he was go­ing to London “to find an agree­ment that re­spects the in­ter­ests and val­ues of the EU and its 27 mem­ber states”.</p>
