    <p>WILMINGTON • White House hope­ful Joe Bi­den has un­veiled an am­bi­tious, US$2 tril­lion (S$2.8 tril­lion) cli­mate change plan that would re­vamp the US en­ergy sec­tor and seek to achieve car­bon pol­lu­tion­free power in just 15 years.</p>
    <p>The clean en­ergy pro­posal was fleshed out in a speech in Wilmington on Tues­day as the vet­eran Demo­crat drew a sharp con­trast with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ahead of Novem­ber’s elec­tion by ar­gu­ing that fight­ing cli­mate change would be a mas­sive job cre­ator un­der a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>In­sist­ing that “there’s no more con­se­quen­tial chal­lenge” to­day than cli­mate change, Mr Bi­den pledged to spend US$2 tril­lion over four years to pro­mote his plan, a dra­matic ac­cel­er­a­tion of the US$1.7 tril­lion he had pro­posed to spend over 10 years dur­ing the pri­mary race.</p>
    <p>“Trans­form­ing the Amer­i­can elec­tri­cal sec­tor to pro­duce power with­out pro­duc­ing car­bon pol­lu­tion... will be the great­est spurring of job cre­ation and eco­nomic com­pet­i­tive­ness in the 21st cen­tury,” Mr Bi­den said. “That’s why we’re go­ing to achieve a car­bon pol­lu­tion-free elec­tric sec­tor by the year 2035.”</p>
    <p>The plan also in­cludes more am­bi­tious goals than the pro­posal he re­leased months ago when he ran as one of the more mod­er­ate Democrats in the party’s nom­i­na­tion race.</p>
    <p>By em­brac­ing some ideas of his pro­gres­sive for­mer ri­vals, in­clud­ing Sen­a­tor Bernie San­ders and Wash­ing­ton Gov­er­nor Jay Inslee, Mr Bi­den ap­pears in­tent on win­ning over pro­gres­sive vot­ers who might be wary of the for­mer vi­cepres­i­dent’s more cen­trist po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated that he would re­join the Paris cli­mate agree­ment that Mr Trump quit in 2017, fund the con­struc­tion of 1.5 mil­lion new en­ergy-ef­fi­cient homes, up­grade ap­pli­ance stan­dards and pri­ori­tise re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>“We’re not just go­ing to tin­ker around the edges,” Mr Bi­den said. “I know meet­ing the chal­lenge will be a once-in-a-life­time op­por­tu­nity to jolt new life into our econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said he would re­verse some 100 steps by Mr Trump to roll back en­vi­ron­men­tal reg­u­la­tions. He also re­called parts of his ear­lier cli­mate pro­posal that would put the na­tion on the road to net zero emis­sions econ­omy-wide no later than 2050.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump de­liv­ered a re­but­tal hours later, ac­cus­ing Mr Bi­den of launch­ing a “hard-left crusade against Amer­i­can en­ergy” and push­ing a plat­form “that would de­mol­ish the US econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>“He wants no oil and gas,” Mr Trump said as he crit­i­cised Mr Bi­den’s plan to re­duce car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den leads Mr Trump on most is­sues, ac­cord­ing to polls, but vot­ers still see the Pres­i­dent as stronger on steer­ing the US econ­omy.</p>
