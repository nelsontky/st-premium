    <p>FireEye’s di­rec­tor of in­tel­li­gence anal­y­sis. FireEye, a prom­i­nent cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany that was breached in con­nec­tion with the in­ci­dent, said tar­gets in­cluded “govern­ment, con­sult­ing, tech­nol­ogy, tele­coms and ex­trac­tive en­ti­ties in North Amer­ica, Europe, Asia and the Mid­dle East”.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • The United States De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity (DHS) and thou­sands of busi­nesses scram­bled on Mon­day to in­ves­ti­gate and re­spond to a sweep­ing hack­ing cam­paign that of­fi­cials sus­pect was di­rected by the Rus­sian govern­ment.</p>
    <p>E-mails sent by of­fi­cials at the DHS, which over­sees bor­der se­cu­rity and de­fence against hack­ing, were mon­i­tored by the hack­ers as part of the so­phis­ti­cated series of breaches, three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks also hit the US de­part­ments of Trea­sury and Com­merce. Parts of the De­fence De­part­ment (DOD) were breached, The New York Times re­ported, while The Washington Post said the State De­part­ment and Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health were also hacked.</p>
    <p>“For op­er­a­tional se­cu­rity rea­sons, the DOD will not com­ment on spe­cific mit­i­ga­tion mea­sures or spec­ify sys­tems that may have been im­pacted,” a Pen­tagon spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy firm So­larWinds, the key step­ping stone used by the hack­ers, said up to 18,000 of its cus­tomers had down­loaded a com­pro­mised soft­ware up­date that l et hack­ers spy on busi­nesses and agen­cies for al­most nine months.</p>
    <p>The US is­sued an emer­gency warn</p>
    <p>ing on Sun­day, or­der­ing govern­ment users to dis­con­nect So­larWinds soft­ware that it said had been com­pro­mised by “ma­li­cious ac­tors”.</p>
    <p>Moscow de­nied any con­nec­tion to the at­tacks.</p>
    <p>One of the peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the hack­ing cam­paign said the crit­i­cal net­work that the DHS’ cy­ber</p>
    <p>se­cu­rity division uses to pro­tect in­fra­struc­ture, in­clud­ing the re­cent elec­tion, had not been breached.</p>
    <p>The DHS is a mas­sive bu­reau­cracy re­spon­si­ble for se­cur­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion of the Covid-19 vac­cine, among other things.</p>
    <p>So­larWinds said it be­lieved the at­tack was the work of an “out­side na</p>
    <p>tion state” that in­serted ma­li­cious code into up­dates of its Orion net­work man­age­ment soft­ware is­sued be­tween March and June.</p>
    <p>“So­larWinds cur­rently be­lieves the ac­tual num­ber of cus­tomers that may have had an in­stal­la­tion of the Orion prod­ucts that con­tained this vul­ner­a­bil­ity to be fewer than 18,000,” it said.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it is not aware of vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in any of its other prod­ucts, and that it is now in­ves­ti­gat­ing with help from US law en­force­ment and out­side cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­perts.</p>
    <p>So­larWinds boasts 300,000 cus­tomers glob­ally, in­clud­ing the ma­jor­ity of Amer­ica’s For­tune 500 com­pa­nies and some of the most sen­si­tive parts of the US and Bri­tish gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Be­cause the at­tack­ers could use So­larWinds to en­ter a net­work and cre­ate a new back­door, merely dis­con­nect­ing the net­work man­age­ment pro­gramme is not enough to boot the hack­ers out, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>For that rea­son, thou­sands of cus­tomers are now look­ing for signs of the hack­ers’ pres­ence and try­ing to dis­able those ex­tra tools.</p>
    <p>A Bri­tish govern­ment spokesman said Bri­tain is not aware of any im­pact from the hack but is still in­ves­ti­gat­ing.</p>
    <p>Three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the hack said that any or­gan­i­sa­tion run­ning a com­pro­mised ver­sion of the Orion soft­ware would have had a “back­door” in­stalled in their com­puter sys­tems by the at­tack­ers.</p>
    <p>Early in­di­ca­tions sug­gest the hack­ers were dis­crim­i­nat­ing about who they chose to break into, ac­cord­ing to two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“What we see is far fewer than all the pos­si­bil­i­ties,” said one per­son. “They are us­ing this like a scalpel.”</p>
    <p>FireEye, a prom­i­nent cy­ber-se­cu­rity com­pany that was breached in con­nec­tion with the in­ci­dent, said other tar­gets in­cluded “govern­ment, con­sult­ing, tech­nol­ogy, tele­coms and ex­trac­tive en­ti­ties in North Amer­ica, Europe, Asia and the Mid­dle East”.</p>
    <p>“If it is cy­ber es­pi­onage, then it is one of the most ef­fec­tive cy­beres­pi­onage cam­paigns we have seen in quite some time,” said Mr John Hultquist, FireEye’s di­rec­tor of in­tel­li­gence anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>EF­FEC­TIVE CY­BER ES­PI­ONAGE</p>
    <p>If it is cy­ber es­pi­onage, then it is one of the most ef­fec­tive cy­ber-es­pi­onage cam­paigns we have seen in quite some time.</p>
