    <p>The Philippine cap­i­tal and four sur­round­ing prov­inces are un­der lock­down again, re­strict­ing some 27 mil­lion peo­ple – about a quar­ter of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion – to their homes for two weeks from to­day, af­ter over­whelmed health work­ers warned that the coun­try was los­ing the bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“We are in the crit­i­cal phase of our man­age­ment of the cri­sis. We can see that the virus’ be­hav­iour is chang­ing,” Mr Car­l­ito Galvez, head of a task force over­see­ing ef­forts to slow the spread of Covid-19, told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said it was ex­pected that cases would rise, as the coun­try be­gan to re­open af­ter a two-month sweep­ing lock­down. But the gov­ern­ment did not an­tic­i­pate how fast the virus would spread.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry yes­ter­day re­ported 3,226 new cases and 46 deaths, bring­ing to­tal in­fec­tions to 106,330, with 2,104 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Three-quar­ters of those cases were tal­lied from the be­gin­ning of June, when the coun­try emerged from one of the long­est stay-ath­ome or­ders.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally fell short. No­body an­tic­i­pated this,” Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte said late on Sun­day, as he re­stored many of the re­stric­tions that were lifted on June 1.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies to Metropoli­tan Manila and the prov­inces of La­guna, Cavite, Rizal and Bu­la­can. Pub­lic trans­port, in­clud­ing rideshar­ing ser­vices, mo­torised rick­shaws and the ubiq­ui­tous jeep­ney minibuses, will be halted.</p>
    <p>Only a lim­ited num­ber of busi­nesses will be al­lowed to op­er­ate. Those that re­main will have to pro­vide shut­tle ser­vices for their staff.</p>
    <p>Non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses that were al­lowed to re­open would again have to close. Th­ese in­clude bar­ber­shops and sa­lons, gyms and fit­ness cen­tres, In­ter­net cafes, pet clin­ics, and test­ing and tu­to­rial cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Malls will have to shut re­tail stores, keep­ing open only gro­ceries and phar­ma­cies. Dining-in at restau­rants will again be pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have been or­dered to stay home un­less they need to buy es­sen­tial goods or ex­er­cise out­doors.</p>
    <p>Ms Ella Sal­va­cion, 47, who works at an out­sourc­ing com­pany, said the new re­stric­tions would have lit­tle ef­fect on her as she has been work­ing from home since March. But there would be in­con­ve­niences. “Mar­kets and some streets would again be closed,” she said.</p>
    <p>Images on so­cial me­dia showed long queues at gro­cery stores and banks, as peo­ple tried to stock up on food and cash.</p>
    <p>Ms Sal­va­cion said she agreed there was a need for tougher curbs as hospi­tals, un­able to cope with the in­flux of pa­tients, were al­ready turn­ing peo­ple away. More than 5,000 med­i­cal work­ers have con­tracted the virus, in­clud­ing 500 in the past week.</p>
    <p>But she did not ex­pect the sit­u­a­tion to im­prove any time soon. “The gov­ern­ment has no plan,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Abel Perez-Cas­tro, 50, who runs an on­line food de­liv­ery ser­vice, ex­pects her busi­ness to pick up. “More cus­tomers will rely on de­liv­er­ies in­stead of buy­ing di­rectly from stores,” she said.</p>
    <p>She also doubted whether the re­turn to a lock­down would make a dif­fer­ence. “Hon­estly, over­all, the han­dling of Covid-19 by the gov­ern­ment is ter­ri­ble. They re­ally don’t have a plan,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque said the gov­ern­ment is “head­ing in the right di­rec­tion”. He added that the new re­stric­tions should dis­cour­age fam­ily and so­cial gath­er­ings, and keep more peo­ple out of their of­fices, which he said were the top rea­sons why in­fec­tions had been spik­ing.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials are mon­i­tor­ing 315 clus­ters in Metro Manila.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at the Univer­sity of the Philip­pines said they ex­pect the tougher curbs to pre­vent at least 50,000 new cases.</p>
    <p>They said in­fec­tions would have topped 220,000 by the end of this month if the gov­ern­ment did not reim­pose the lock­down.</p>
