    <p>MADRID • Uruguay for­ward Luis Suarez has apol­o­gised for the team low­er­ing their guard dur­ing the in­ter­na­tional break af­ter 16 mem­bers of their squad and staff, in­clud­ing the Atletico Madrid striker, tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Fierce crit­i­cism has been di­rected to­wards the na­tional team af­ter pic­tures emerged of the play­ers en­joy­ing a bar­be­cue with­out ob­serv­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing as well as shar­ing the tra­di­tional South Amer­i­can mate tea, which is drunk through a com­mu­nal straw.</p>
    <p>“Many people are crit­i­cis­ing us, we com­mit­ted an er­ror and we apol­o­gise for that,” Suarez told Uruguay TV pro­gramme Punto Pe­nal on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“The in­fec­tion did not hap­pen be­cause of the bar­be­cue, that’s very clear. We had the bad luck of one of us get­ting in­fected in Colom­bia.”</p>
    <p>Suarez was among 10 play­ers to test pos­i­tive while away with Uruguay, along with his Atletico team­mate Lu­cas Tor­reira as well as Cagliari de­fender and Uruguay cap­tain Diego Godin, while six staff mem­bers were also in­fected.</p>
    <p>Suarez, who missed Uruguay’s 2-0 World Cup qual­i­fy­ing de­feat by Brazil as well as Atletico’s 1-0 La Liga win over his for­mer side Barcelona on Saturday, said he was asymp­to­matic and was self-iso­lat­ing in an apart­ment in Madrid.</p>
    <p>He also said he and other team­mates had tested neg­a­tive on sev­eral oc­ca­sions dur­ing the in­ter­na­tional break, in­clud­ing af­ter Palmeiras de­fender Ma­tias Vina be­came the first player to test pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“We all felt un­cer­tain as we had been with Ma­tias in the dress­ing room and the show­ers, but then we tested neg­a­tive and thought we were safe,” Suarez added. “Then un­for­tu­nately, there were more cases and the whole thing snow­balled. We made a mis­take. We let our guard down when we tested neg­a­tive and then sev­eral pos­i­tive tests started ap­pear­ing. We did some­thing wrong.</p>
    <p>“This should serve as a warn­ing to all young people out there and every­body else that no­body is im­mune and even though we are tested very of­ten, we need to take care of our­selves.”</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s health min­istry has since fined the Uruguayan Football Fed­er­a­tion US$15,000 (S$20,110) for “fail­ing to re­spect health pro­to­cols”, while Health Min­is­ter Daniel Sali­nas hit out at the “lack of con­cern” shown by the team.</p>
    <p>Atletico pres­i­dent En­rique Cerezo also blasted the lax mea­sures, say­ing the club would file a com­plaint with Fifa and telling Span­ish ra­dio sta­tion Cadena Sur: “They weren’t tested. In Spain, the play­ers don’t shower (to­gether). We mon­i­tor them be­fore and af­ter a match and train­ing.”</p>
