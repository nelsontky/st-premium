    <p>The new Lam­borgh­ini Hu­ra­can Evo RWD (rear-wheel drive) (be­low) han­dles flaw­lessly, with noth­ing in ev­ery­day driv­ing that is ca­pa­ble of un­set­tling it (as long as its trac­tion con­trol is left on). Its steer­ing is beau­ti­fully set up, with an op­ti­mal blend of re­spon­sive­ness and ef­fort­less­ness. The car takes 3.3 seconds to hit the cen­tury mark and has a top speed of 325kmh.</p>
    <p>If you like dough­nuts like Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin does, grab some from Ko­rio, which has ar­guably the best ones in town.</p>
    <p>But if, like me, you like dough­nuts of the rub­ber-burn­ing kind, the new Lam­borgh­ini Hu­ra­can Evo</p>
    <p>RWD (rear-wheel-drive) makes some pretty mean ones.</p>
    <p>Un­like its all-wheel-drive twin, the Evo RWD gets all its power sent to its rear axle. Although pared down slightly, its out­put of 610hp and 560Nm (ver­sus 640hp/600Nm in the all-wheel-drive car) is still enor­mous – of­ten too enor­mous for just one axle to han­dle.</p>
    <p>Lam­borgh­ini, how­ever, has cal­i­brated the car’s trac­tion con­trol sys­tem to curb its propen­sity for slip-slid­ing.</p>
    <p>Herein lies its higher entertainm­ent value. Se­lect the Corsa (or track) drive mode, switch off the trac­tion con­trol, floor the throt­tle and you can flick the car on its axis ef­fort­lessly.</p>
    <p>This ma­noeu­vre is some­what more cum­ber­some in the all-wheeldrive Evo, which dis­trib­utes torque to its front axle when­ever it senses slip. Even if you are able to ex­e­cute dough­nuts in this all-wheel-drive car, the cir­cles you make on the tar­mac will be con­sid­er­ably larger than those made by the rear-wheeldrive Evo.</p>
    <p>For less rogu­ish an­tics, you will find the RWD is just as ca­pa­ble as the AWD (all-wheel-drive). Its ride is a bit harsher be­cause it does not have the adap­tive elec­tro­mag­netic dampers of the AWD. In­stead, it re­lies on more tra­di­tional steel springs and hy­draulic dampers.</p>
    <p>At the wheel, the car feels breezier and more spon­ta­neous. It han­dles flaw­lessly, with noth­ing in ev­ery­day driv­ing that is ca­pa­ble of un­set­tling it (as long as its trac­tion con­trol is left on).</p>
    <p>Its steer­ing is beau­ti­fully set up, with an op­ti­mal blend of re­spon­sive­ness, com­mu­nica­tive­ness and ef­fort­less­ness.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, there is rarely any op­por­tu­nity to drive a Lam­borgh­ini hard. But there are am­ple op­por­tu­ni­ties to en­joy the mu­sic it makes.</p>
    <p>The Evo RWD is just as rous­ing as the AWD, es­pe­cially in Sport mode. Driven in this mode, the car’s 5.2-litre nor­mally as­pi­rated V10 sings. There is no en­gine more vis­ceral than a nor­mally as­pi­rated V10 and the one in the Evo is at­tached to an ex­haust sys­tem which acts like high-fidelity speak­ers.</p>
    <p>You do not have to drive hard to en­joy its bal­lis­tic bal­lad, but send the revs fly­ing when­ever you can and feel the hair on your neck ris­ing.</p>
    <p>The car takes 3.3 seconds to hit the cen­tury mark, ver­sus 2.9 seconds for the AWD. Top speed for both is 325kmh.</p>
    <p>The RWD has a dry weight of 1,389kg ver­sus 1,422kg for the AWD. This slight weight ad­van­tage, how­ever, does not trans­late to bet­ter stop­ping power – the car takes 31.9m to come to a halt from 100kmh, sim­i­lar to the AWD.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther does it trans­late to bet­ter ef­fi­ciency. In fact, the RWD con­sumes 13.8 litres for 100km, ver­sus 13.7 litres for the AWD. In real life, both cars are at least 30 per cent thirstier.</p>
    <p>Be­sides its dough­nut-mak­ing skills, there is an­other huge rea­son for the Evo RWD’s al­lure – its price. At just be­low $800,000, it is $160,000 less costly than the AWD.</p>
    <p>Can you i mag­ine how many Ko­rio dough­nuts you can buy with $160,000?</p>
