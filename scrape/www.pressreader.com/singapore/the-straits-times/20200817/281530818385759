    <p>Rus­sia has told Be­laru­sian leader Alexan­der Lukashenko that it is ready to of­fer mil­i­tary as­sis­tance if nec­es­sary as de­mon­stra­tors yes­ter­day held one of the big­gest protests yet against Mr Lukashenko’s dis­puted re-elec­tion. The protest in Minsk at­tracted tens of thou­sands of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>MINSK • Rus­sia said yes­ter­day it had told Be­laru­sian leader Alexan­der Lukashenko that it was ready to of­fer mil­i­tary as­sis­tance if nec­es­sary, as de­mon­stra­tors held one of the big­gest protests yet against Mr Lukashenko’s con­tested re-elec­tion. The protest in Minsk at­tracted tens of thou­sands of peo­ple, de­spite the deaths of at least two protesters and thou­sands of de­ten­tions since the Aug 9 vote.</p>
    <p>Op­po­nents of Mr Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, said the vote was rigged to dis­guise the fact that he has lost pub­lic sup­port.</p>
    <p>He de­nies los­ing, cit­ing of­fi­cial re­sults that gave him just over 80 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin said Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin had told Mr Lukashenko that Moscow was ready to as­sist Be­larus in ac­cor­dance with a col­lec­tive mil­i­tary pact if nec­es­sary and that ex­ter­nal pres­sure was be­ing ap­plied to the coun­try. It did not say where from.</p>
    <p>Shortly be­fore the op­po­si­tion protest, there was tight se­cu­rity as Mr Lukashenko’s sup­port­ers gath­ered in cen­tral Minsk for the first time since the elec­tion to voice their sup­port for him and watch him give a fiery speech.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, un­der pres­sure from the Euro­pean Union for crack­ing down on his op­po­nents, said Nato tanks and planes had been de­ployed 15 min­utes from the Be­laru­sian bor­der. Nato said it was closely mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion in Be­larus, but that there was no mil­i­tary build-up at the coun­try’s west­ern bor­der.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, who has al­leged a for­eign-backed plot to top­ple him, said Be­larus was un­der pres­sure.</p>
    <p>“Nato troops are at our gates. Lithua­nia, Latvia, Poland and our na­tive Ukraine are or­der­ing us to hold new elec­tions,” he said, adding that Be­larus would “die as a state” if new polls were held.</p>
    <p>“I have never be­trayed you and will never do so,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Svet­lana Tikhanousk­aya, Mr Lukashenko’s op­po­si­tion ri­val in the con­tested elec­tion, had called for a huge “March of Free­dom” through the cen­tre of Minsk, the Be­laru­sian cap­i­tal, and in other towns and cities yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A Reuters re­porter said the Minsk seg­ment of the rally was huge, with up­wards of 100,000 peo­ple present, and that a car­ni­val at­mos­phere pre­vailed.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple car­ried red and white flags and chanted “Lukashenko step down” and “We won’t for­get or for­give”.</p>
    <p>A 31-year-old worker who wanted to be known as Mr Alexei said the protesters’ ac­tions might not stay so peace­ful if they did not get what they wanted.</p>
    <p>“We all want Lukashenko to step down,” he said. “For now we are ask­ing, but we will get sick of ask­ing.”</p>
    <p>State em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing some po­lice of­fi­cers and state TV staff, have come out in sup­port of the protests.</p>
    <p>Some of the coun­try’s big­gest state-run in­dus­trial plants, the back­bone of Mr Lukashenko’s Sovi­et­style eco­nomic model, have been hit by protests and walk­outs too.</p>
    <p>Around 5,000 peo­ple at­tended the pro-Lukashenko protest, a Reuters re­porter es­ti­mated. The Be­laru­sian In­te­rior Min­istry put the num­ber at 65,000.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion me­dia chan­nels said Mr Lukashenko, a one-time man­ager of a Soviet-era col­lec­tive farm, bussed peo­ple in from other parts of the coun­try and they were co­erced into at­tend­ing. Reuters could not in­de­pen­dently con­firm that.</p>
    <p>“The moth­er­land is in dan­ger!” one speaker told the crowd, who chanted: “We are united, in­di­vis­i­ble!”</p>
    <p>Some of those present held Be­laru­sian na­tional flags and chanted “For Be­larus!” or “For Batka!”, Mr</p>
    <p>Lukashenko’s af­fec­tion­ate nick­name, as pa­tri­otic mu­sic sounded from speak­ers.</p>
    <p>“I’m for Lukashenko,” said 68-year-old Alla Ge­orgievna. “I don’t un­der­stand why ev­ery­one has risen up against him. We get our pen­sions and salaries on time thanks to him.”</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Ms Tikhanousk­aya, who fled to neigh­bour­ing Lithua­nia last Tues­day, has called for an elec­tion re­count. Her cam­paign has also an­nounced that she is start­ing to form a na­tional coun­cil to fa­cil­i­tate a power trans­fer.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia, which has had a trou­bled re­la­tion­ship with Mr Lukashenko, is watch­ing closely as Be­larus hosts pipe­lines that carry Rus­sian en­ergy ex­ports to the West, and is also viewed by Moscow as a buf­fer zone against Nato.</p>
    <p>The EU is gear­ing up to im­pose new sanc­tions on Be­larus in re­sponse to the vi­o­lent crack­down.</p>
