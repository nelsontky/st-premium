    <p>Like many chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore, my seven-year-old daugh­ter grew up in high-rise, con­crete flats and is well-versed in the virtual on­line worlds of games like Minecraft.</p>
    <p>So I was ea­ger to take her, my wife and our 20-month-old tod­dler to Let’s Go Tour’s Kam­pong Ex­pe­ri­ence tour, which promised to give a glimpse of what ru­ral liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore is like.</p>
    <p>The two hours we spent at Sin­ga­pore’s last main­land vil­lage, Kam­pong Lorong Buangkok, was a chance to show my Gen Al­pha daugh­ters that Sin­ga­pore was not al­ways the slick, mod­ern city that they grew up in.</p>
    <p>It helped that the guided tour was tai­lored for fam­i­lies with kids. Our bub­bly guide Colin kept the chil­dren oc­cu­pied with his­tory lessons on how Sin­ga­pore’s kam­pungs gave way to Hous­ing Board flats, bits of trivia on vil­lage life and plenty of old-school games that did not in­volve touch­screens or cre­at­ing your own virtual avatar.</p>
    <p>The kam­pung off Yio Chu Kang Road has all the mod­ern ameni­ties we are all used to, of course – the 4G connection is just as strong as in any other part of Sin­ga­pore and one of the houses we went to had two flatscreen tele­vi­sions in the liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>Still, my older daugh­ter was im­pressed that there are fam­i­lies in Sin­ga­pore who live in wood­en­walled and zinc-roofed houses sur­rounded on all sides by na­ture.</p>
    <p>I thought it would be weird for the res­i­dents there to have strangers walk through their vil­lage and gawk, but ap­par­ently stu­dents have been go­ing there for school projects for years.</p>
    <p>An el­derly Malay lady sit­ting at her pa­tio waved word­lessly at our group as we passed by. Just an­other day of tourist-watch­ing, prob­a­bly.</p>
    <p>It rained the whole time we were there so we spent most of the tour in­side two of the houses there – both much, much more spa­cious than your av­er­age lo­cal flat.</p>
    <p>We meet Madam Sng Mui Hong, who owns the land that the kam­pung sits on. The 68-year-old’s fa­ther, tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine seller Sng Teow Koon, ac­quired the for­mer swamp­land in 1956 and leased the land to the fam­i­lies who first set­tled there.</p>
    <p>It is mind-blow­ing to dis­cover that she rents out each of the 25 houses, home to an al­most equal num­ber of Chi­nese and Malay fam­i­lies, for just $4.50 to $30 a month.</p>
    <p>That is a lot less than what I am pay­ing for my Net­flix, Spo­tify and var­i­ous other stream­ing sub­scrip­tions, I thought to my­self.</p>
    <p>The walk through the whole kam­pung was brief, but we did get to see the rich va­ri­ety of flora, from bam­boo and moringa to co­coa and banana trees.</p>
    <p>We also got to try a Chi­nese chest­nut fruit that had fallen off one of the trees there – surely a nov­elty for my daugh­ters who are used to hav­ing their fruit come from the neigh­bour­hood FairPrice su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>If you ig­nored the HDB blocks and multi-storey carpark right next to the vil­lage, you could al­most imag­ine be­ing out of Sin­ga­pore. It felt com­fort­ing to hear the rain pat­ter on the roof and chick­ens cluck­ing out­side.</p>
    <p>We missed out on the out­door games that are usu­ally part of the tour be­cause of the weather, but we did get to en­joy “air batu” made by the res­i­dent of one of the houses we vis­ited, Madam Maimah Ah­mad.</p>
    <p>Get­ting to savour the flavoured ice treats was a high­light for my seven-year-old – what kid could re­sist sweet, homemade treats?</p>
    <p>She was also en­thu­si­as­tic when Colin en­gaged her in retro games that Sin­ga­pore kids used to play in the past – batu se­lem­bat, pick-up sticks and string­ing rub­ber bands to­gether for zero-point.</p>
    <p>The Kam­pong Ex­pe­ri­ence Tour is just one of Let’s Go’s many new of­fer­ings aimed at the do­mes­tic tourism mar­ket. Other his­tory-themed ones in­clude one that traces Stam­ford Raf­fles’ foot­steps along the Sin­ga­pore River and an­other that ex­plores the spices, herbs and plants found in Fort Can­ning.</p>
    <p>While the kam­pung tour was cer­tainly an eye-opener for the kids, I would have loved to spend more time there. If they ever come up with an overnight stay pack­age, we would be one of the first to sign up.</p>
