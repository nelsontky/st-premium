    <p>Es­tab­lish­ing and main­tain­ing a clean and trusted fi­nan­cial hub has been at the core of Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic suc­cess.</p>
    <p>While its strate­gic ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion made it a port of choice on the world ship­ping map, the emer­gence and con­tin­ued growth of cred­i­ble fi­nan­cial ser­vices as­sured thriv­ing trade flows.</p>
    <p>That is why Sin­ga­pore con­sid­ers fight­ing fi­nan­cial crime, in­clud­ing money laun­der­ing and other forms of il­licit and sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions, as a con­tin­u­ing pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Some re­cent ex­am­ples of en­force­ment ac­tions taken in­clude mat­ters re­lated to in­sol­vent pay­ments firm Wire­card and wa­ter treat­ment firm Hyflux as well as the cases re­lated to the 1Malaysia Developmen­t Ber­had (1MDB) scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s (MAS) lat­est en­force­ment re­port shows the depth and breath of the ef­fort to de­ter fi­nan­cial mis­de­meanour – to pro­tect con­sumers and main­tain in­vestor con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>The re­port, which cov­ers the pe­riod from Jan­uary last year to this June, shows that sev­eral in­di­vid­u­als were con­victed and tens of mil­lions of dol­lars were paid in penal­ties as the MAS raised the bar in its fight against fi­nan­cial crimes.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Mak Yuen Teen said: “It is crit­i­cally im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to main­tain a clean and trusted rep­u­ta­tion to be con­sid­ered a ma­jor in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial cen­tre and for a cred­i­ble cap­i­tal mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial sec­tor – which in­cludes bank­ing, as­set man­age­ment, in­sur­ance and cap­i­tal mar­kets – ac­counts for about 15 per cent of the na­tion’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) and pro­vides jobs to tens of thou­sands of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of what the sec­tor does, rang­ing from in­ter­me­di­a­tion of sav­ings to in­vest­ments and busi­ness for­ma­tion, rip­ples across the economy and mag­ni­fies its con­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>With­out its cred­i­bil­ity, the fi­nan­cial sec­tor would not have been able to do that or sup­port the Repub­lic’s bur­geon­ing trade flows.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s trade – the sum of ex­ports and im­ports of goods and ser­vices – to GDP ra­tio stood at about 300 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>The MAS en­force­ment re­port re­flects the suc­cess Sin­ga­pore’s reg­u­la­tors have achieved in early de­tec­tion of mis­con­duct and breaches of law. In 2016, the au­thor­ity es­tab­lished a ded­i­cated en­force­ment de­part­ment to cen­tralise en­force­ment func­tions.</p>
    <p>Swift and tough reg­u­la­tory ac­tions against fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and in­di­vid­u­als who breach the rules also re­quired close col­lab­o­ra­tion with other agen­cies such as the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) of the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force, the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Acra), the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bu­reau and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX).</p>
    <p>These part­ner­ships helped in re­views or investigat­ions in sev­eral com­plex cases, in­clud­ing mat­ters re­lated to Wire­card, Ea­gle Hospi­tal­ity Trust and Hyflux.</p>
    <p>Still, ef­fec­tive de­ter­rence and shap­ing of busi­ness and mar­ket con­duct are an on­go­ing process.</p>
    <p>Prof Mak said that cor­po­rate dis­clo­sure breaches and the whole area of en­force­ment against listed com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing se­nior man­age­ment ac­count­abil­ity, are a work in progress.</p>
    <p>He said some of the let­ters of ad­vice is­sued by the MAS to 34 in­di­vid­u­als and 42 com­pa­nies may re­late to cor­po­rate dis­clo­sure fail­ures. “Hope­fully, we will see SGX, Acra, MAS and CAD all step­ping up in this area as con­fi­dence in com­pa­nies listed on SGX has been badly dented due to wide­spread breaches.”</p>
    <p>FIGHT­ING MONEY LAUN­DER­ING</p>
    <p>Another chal­leng­ing area of en­force­ment is that of anti-money laun­der­ing (AML) and coun­ter­ing the fi­nanc­ing of ter­ror­ism com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>Money laun­der­ing is crit­i­cal to the ef­fec­tive op­er­a­tion of vir­tu­ally ev­ery form of transna­tional and or­gan­ised crime.</p>
    <p>As long as there are peo­ple try­ing to en­sure that crime pays, they will con­tinue to dis­guise the ori­gin of their crim­i­nal money so that they can avoid de­tec­tion and the risk of prose­cu­tion when they use it.</p>
    <p>The mag­ni­tude of the chal­lenge and the bur­den it places on both fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and reg­u­la­tors can be gauged by the fact that banks world­wide paid about US$26 bil­lion (S$35 bil­lion) in penal­ties be­tween 2008 and 2018 for fail­ing to con­trol il­licit trans­ac­tions through their ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The cases re­lated to 1MDB were not part of the lat­est MAS re­port.</p>
    <p>But the US$5 bil­lion re­cently paid as set­tle­ment by Gold­man Sachs to reg­u­la­tors across the world, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore, goes to show that even a global in­vest­ment bank­ing giant is not in­vul­ner­a­ble to crim­i­nal ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Ste­fanie Yuen Thio, joint man­ag­ing part­ner at TSMP Law Cor­po­ra­tion, said: “The world is in­creas­ingly in­ter­con­nected, which means that there will be more multi-ju­ris­dic­tional fund flows.”</p>
    <p>Investigat­ions and en­force­ment will only be­come more chal­leng­ing, as tech­nol­ogy rapidly evolves, fi­nan­cial prod­ucts grow in com­plex­ity and cases be­come in­creas­ingly multi-ju­ris­dic­tional in na­ture.</p>
    <p>Bil­lions of dol­lars flow ev­ery day through the 15,000-plus fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions based here.</p>
    <p>Given Sin­ga­pore’s promi­nence and growth as a wealth man­age­ment cen­tre, that vul­ner­a­bil­ity is even greater.</p>
    <p>Thus, AML com­pli­ance will re­main one of the top en­force­ment pri­or­i­ties – with the spot­light on fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions that lack rig­or­ous sys­tems and pro­cesses for com­bat­ing il­licit trans­ac­tions.</p>
