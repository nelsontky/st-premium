    <p>As with many young en­trepreneur­s across the world, Mr Ro­hit Ra­man, who ran a suc­cess­ful print­ing and de­sign firm in New Delhi, was hit hard by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He had to wind up his busi­ness in June, draw on sup­port from his par­ents to re­pay loans, help find jobs for 20 em­ploy­ees he laid off, va­cate the flat he rented and re­turn to live with his par­ents in Bi­har – all of this cul­mi­nat­ing in a tail­spin that led him to be clin­i­cally di­ag­nosed with de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>But the 33-year-old pulled back from the precipice, turn­ing the pan­demic into an op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­man, who had en­rolled in an un­der­grad­u­ate law pro­gramme in 2017, fin­ished it in Septem­ber this year and found him­self a new role that he will take up this month – a con­sul­tant po­si­tion at a trust that works with the gov­ern­ment on its skill de­vel­op­ment ini­tia­tives for the marginalis­ed.</p>
    <p>It has been quite a trans­for­ma­tion for Mr Ra­man, from be­ing his own boss – which led him to de­velop an er­ratic rou­tine – to a dis­ci­plined daily reg­i­men rec­om­mended by his psy­chi­atric coun­sel­lor.</p>
    <p>A late riser un­til a few months ago, he now be­gins his day at 3am with morn­ing yoga and a run, fol­lowed by a fo­cused study ses­sion to help him pre­pare for his new job.</p>
    <p>“I am ready to head out by 7am th­ese days,” Mr Ra­man tells The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has filled a gap for me. I have reskilled my­self and changed my at­ti­tude to­wards work and to life. It has helped me un­der­stand where I was lack­ing.</p>
    <p>“I even took feed­back from fam­ily and close friends and adapted their sug­ges­tions to im­prove my­self.”</p>
    <p>While Mr Ra­man re­grets los­ing a thriv­ing busi­ness, he does not want to keep look­ing back.</p>
    <p>“I had never thought that things would go this way, but the pan­demic has com­pelled me to move on,” he says. “I have to sur­vive with what I have be­cause op­por­tu­ni­ties are few and far be­tween.”</p>
    <p>And, while he has over­come pro­fes­sional chal­lenges and even suc­cess­fully bat­tled de­pres­sion, Mr Ra­man and his wife, who were mar­ried in 2018, have put off their plans to have a child for an­other year at least.</p>
    <p>He says: “I can­not bring some</p>
