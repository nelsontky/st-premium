    <p>2020 has been a year of up­heaval and cri­sis – one that was shaped by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. It also saw sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ments, such as a gen­eral elec­tion in Sin­ga­pore and the United States elect­ing its next leader. In this 12-day se­ries,</p>
    <p>More than a month af­ter Amer­ica’s elec­tion day, and even af­ter the Elec­toral Col­lege for­mally sealed Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is no closer to con­ced­ing de­feat.</p>
    <p>“If I lost, I’d be a very gra­cious loser,” he said at a Dec 5 rally in Ge­or­gia, where he was stump­ing for two Repub­li­can se­na­tors who face a run-off race next month. “But you can’t ever ac­cept when they steal and rig and rob.”</p>
    <p>“Stop the steal,” sup­port­ers chanted in re­sponse – the slo­gan that has emerged as a ral­ly­ing cry of those who be­lieve the elec­tion was rigged by Democrats who robbed Mr Trump of his right­ful vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“The Democrats did try to steal the pres­i­dency,” Mr Trump re­sponded. But he won nei­ther the Elec­toral Col­lege nor the pop­u­lar vote, a fact that was in­creas­ingly ce­mented as more swing states fi­nalised and cer­ti­fied their re­sults.</p>
    <p>He ended up with 232 Elec­toral Col­lege votes to Demo­crat Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s 306, far be­low the 270 elec­toral votes needed to win the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther did Mr Trump win the pop­u­lar vote. He gar­nered 74.2 mil­lion votes, the sec­ond-high­est in Amer­ica’s his­tory, but was beaten to the record by Mr Bi­den, who won 81.3 mil­lion votes in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, Mr Trump’s com­plete re­fusal to pub­licly ac­cept his elec­toral de­feat – from his posts on Twit­ter to his cam­paign’s law­suits chal­leng­ing the re­sults and poll ad­min­is­tra­tion in swing states – has dom­i­nated head­lines for much of Novem­ber and De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>But he and his al­lies have also spent much of the year lay­ing the ground­work for the claims, with a steady stream of un­sub­stan­ti­ated al­le­ga­tions that mail-in bal­lots are prone to fraud. Mr Trump has also falsely claimed that bal­lots counted af­ter elec­tion day are il­le­gal, de­spite the phys­i­cal im­pos­si­bil­ity of com­plet­ing count­ing by elec­tion night and Amer­ica’s long his­tory of tak­ing days to count all its votes.</p>
    <p>Given that back­drop, the strong con­vic­tions of Mr Trump’s sup­port­ers are un­sur­pris­ing, never mind that no com­pelling proof has been pre­sented to back up their claims of con­spir­acy.</p>
    <p>They have blamed vot­ing ma­chines for chang­ing Trump votes to Bi­den ones, and claimed that votes were cast on be­half of dead peo­ple and by il­le­gal im­mi­grants.</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Repub­li­can ones, have found no ev­i­dence of wide­spread ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties of the sort Mr Trump has as­serted, and states like Ge­or­gia have held mul­ti­ple re­counts that re­asserted Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Courts have also thrown out the Trump cam­paign’s slew of law­suits chal­leng­ing the counts. On Nov 27, an ap­peals court in Penn­syl­va­nia ruled the Trump cam­paign could not halt the state’s cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>Judge Stephanos Bibas, who had been nom­i­nated to the post by Mr Trump him­self in 2017, wrote in the unan­i­mous de­ci­sion: “Free, fair elec­tions are the lifeblood of our democ­racy. Charges of un­fair­ness are se­ri­ous. But call­ing an elec­tion un­fair does not make it so. Charges re­quire spe­cific al­le­ga­tions and then proof. We have nei­ther here.”</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, since elec­tion day, Trump sup­port­ers be­liev­ing in a stolen elec­tion have con­gre­gated to de­mand that the vote counts be stopped, cry­ing foul as mail bal­lots counted later evap­o­rated early Repub­li­can leads in swing states like Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia, Wis­con­sin, Ge­or­gia and Ari­zona.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of them have protested in cities across the United States, in­clud­ing in Wash­ing­ton, at “Stop the Steal” ral­lies.</p>
    <p>Most Repub­li­can law­mak­ers have kept largely silent, although more have ac­knowl­edged Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory in re­cent days fol­low­ing the Elec­toral Col­lege vote last Mon­day that for­malised the win.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, how­ever, have re­peated Mr Trump’s base­less claims.</p>
    <p>At a Se­nate hear­ing last Wed­nes­day, Ken­tucky Sen­a­tor Rand Paul said: “The elec­tion in many ways was stolen.”</p>
    <p>Elec­tion watch­ers have pointed out that the nar­ra­tive of a stolen elec­tion is dan­ger­ous as it un­der­mines the le­git­i­macy of the elec­tion and weak­ens Amer­i­cans’ faith in democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, polls in­creas­ingly show that many Repub­li­can vot­ers be­lieve Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>A Reuters-Ip­sos poll re­leased on Nov 18 found that while 63 per cent of Amer­i­cans be­lieve Mr Bi­den right­fully won the elec­tion, only 29 per cent of Repub­li­cans think so, com­pared with 95 per cent of Democrats.</p>
    <p>An­other more re­cent poll by Fox News con­ducted from Dec 6 to Dec 9 found that 36 per cent of vot­ers over­all say the elec­tion was stolen from Mr Trump. But it was a highly par­ti­san is­sue, with 68 per cent of Repub­li­cans and 77 per cent of Trump vot­ers hold­ing this view.</p>
    <p>The rhetoric around the “stolen” elec­tion has also es­ca­lated in re­cent days, with Repub­li­can sur­ro­gates es­pous­ing in­creas­ingly di­vi­sive ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Allen West, chair­man of the Repub­li­can Party of Texas, ap­peared to sug­gest se­ces­sion on Dec 11 af­ter the Supreme Court dis­missed a law­suit aimed at over­turn­ing poll re­sults. “Per­haps law-abid­ing states should bond to­gether and form a union of states that will abide by the Con­sti­tu­tion,” Mr West said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>And on Fri­day, for­mer Trump na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Michael Flynn sug­gested dur­ing a News­max tele­vi­sion in­ter­view that Mr Trump could de­ploy the military in swing states that he lost to “ba­si­cally re­run an elec­tion each in those states”.</p>
    <p>This di­vi­sive­ness will not go away on In­au­gu­ra­tion Day. “Repub­li­can vot­ers who stood by Trump are an­gry,” wrote US an­a­lysts from the Eura­sia Group con­sul­tancy in a com­men­tary on Fri­day. “Most of them be­lieve the elec­tion was stolen and that’s not a sen­ti­ment that can be waved away on In­au­gu­ra­tion Day.”</p>
