    <p>Train­ing and ap­pren­tice­ship pro­grammes of­fered as part of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age should trans­late into more ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties down the road, said Senior Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs and Trans­port Chee Hong Tat.</p>
    <p>Un­der this pack­age, the Gov­ern­ment aims to cre­ate close to 100,000 jobs, trainee­ships and skills-train­ing places for job seek­ers in the next year through var­i­ous ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing the launch­ing of satel­lite ca­reer cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Some job seek­ers have ex­pressed con­cern over the tem­po­rary na­ture of trainee­ships and at­tach­ment pro­grammes dur­ing these times of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty, but Mr Chee, who is an MP for Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC, said such place­ments are im­por­tant dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Jobs are harder to come by now. But when (eco­nomic) re­cov­ery comes six months or 12 months later – hope­fully sooner – there will be more jobs avail­able. And that’s when train­ing will al­low work­ers to have more skills to ac­cess those job open­ings and find per­ma­nent jobs sub­se­quently,” he told the me­dia at a job fair at HDB Hub in Toa Payoh yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was joined by fel­low Bis­han</p>
    <p>Toa Payoh GRC MPs Chong Kee Hiong and Sak­tiandi Su­paat, as well as Ms Gan Siow Huang, the MP for Mary­mount SMC.</p>
    <p>Ms Gan said it is hoped that com­pa­nies that pro­vide train­ing and ap­pren­tice­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties would con­sider hir­ing these job seek­ers after their place­ments.</p>
    <p>“We do hope these job seek­ers will be able to pick up new skills, new net­works and at the end of the en­ter­prise train­ing, be hired by the com­pany or have a greater net­work for them to be able to find new jobs,” she said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Chee also an­nounced that an SGUnited Jobs and Skills Centre will be open­ing at Toa Payoh West Com­mu­nity Centre. It will pro­vide ca­reer-match­ing ser­vices and advice to job seek­ers in the area.</p>
    <p>Since July 1, eight such satel­lite ca­reer cen­tres have al­ready helped about 1,300 job seek­ers by giv­ing them ba­sic ca­reer advice and aid in their job search, said Mr Chee.</p>
    <p>From Aug 15, another eight satel­lite ca­reer cen­tres will open in the heart­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said the na­ture of the econ­omy and jobs had started chang­ing even before the coron­avirus hit Sin­ga­pore’s shores, but the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the pace of this change.</p>
    <p>“So we must be prepared to make some fun­da­men­tal changes to our eco­nomic poli­cies and also in­di­vid­u­ally, our own mind­sets as em­ploy­ers and job seek­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We can’t go back to what things used to be and ex­pect that the world will change for us. We have to adapt to this new world.”</p>
    <p>PRE­PAR­ING FOR OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES</p>
    <p>Jobs are harder to come by now. But when (eco­nomic) re­cov­ery comes six months or 12 months later – hope­fully sooner – there will be more jobs avail­able. And that’s when train­ing will al­low work­ers to have more skills to ac­cess those job open­ings and find per­ma­nent jobs</p>
    <p>’’ sub­se­quently.</p>
