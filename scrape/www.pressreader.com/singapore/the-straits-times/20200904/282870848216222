    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>See if you can get your friends to fol­low along as you make your way through ex­cit­ing events. They are in a for a ride.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Try not to rush and pick up on the first so­lu­tion that sounds good. Things should work out well if you take your time.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple mean well, so do not brush them off when they come to you with ad­vice. At least one of them is sure to hit it out of the park.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You have to slow down, no mat­ter what your boss or mate is telling you. Let them know you need to get it right be­fore get­ting back to work.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are busy, but you are hav­ing great fun. As long as your mind is en­gaged, you should be able to keep a smile on your face.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your col­leagues are driv­ing you crazy. Avoid con­flict as things need to re­solve or­gan­i­cally and with­out too much ran­cour.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Keep your so­cial­is­ing light. Big groups do not give you the en­ergy you want, whereas one-on-one in­ter­ac­tion revs you up more.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Things could get awk­ward if you let con­flict sim­mer for too long. Be the grown-up and de-es­ca­late things as much as you can.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Make a game out of an ac­tiv­ity – your friends or col­leagues are sure to join in. Things may get weird if you start to keep score, though.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are fa­mous for your sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity. Peo­ple might look to you for aid or you may be seen as an im­par­tial judge in a con­flict.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You de­tect a pat­tern that is start­ing to emerge. You may not yet be able to de­scribe it, but you can start to make amaz­ing pre­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Try not to take your head out of the clouds, no mat­ter what any­one else says. Your il­lu­sions are more real than what they see.</p>
