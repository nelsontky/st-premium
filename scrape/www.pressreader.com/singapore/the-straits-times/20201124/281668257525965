    <p>There were five new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, all of which were im­ported.</p>
    <p>This means there were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from worker’s dor­mi­to­ries for the 13th day in a row.</p>
    <p>This is the l ongest stretch with­out a com­mu­nity case since the first coro­n­avirus case was re­ported in Sin­ga­pore on Jan 23.</p>
    <p>There were 12 days be­tween the first re­ported case, which was i mported, and the first recorded com­mu­nity cases on Feb 4.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new i mported cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,165.</p>
    <p>These new pa­tients were placed on stay-home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>They were asymp­to­matic and con­firmed pos­i­tive on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Of the five new cases, there was one Sin­ga­porean – a 16-year-old girl who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Three of the im­ported cases are work per­mit hold­ers, all women, aged be­tween 29 and 39, who re­turned from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The last im­ported case is a short-term visit pass holder. The 58-year-old man had re­turned from France.</p>
    <p>With four cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,056 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 30 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. One pa­tient is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>With four cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,056 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 30 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. One pa­tient is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
