    <p>Busi­nesses can now ap­ply for a new ac­cred­i­ta­tion frame­work meant to en­cour­age them to be more in­clu­sive and hire peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The En­abling Mark, rolled out yes­ter­day by SG En­able – an agency ded­i­cated to en­abling peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties – aims to be a bench­mark as well as pro­vide recog­ni­tion to or­gan­i­sa­tions for their prac­tices in dis­abil­ity-in­clu­sive em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>The on­line launch over Zoom was at­tended by guest of hon­our, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob, and Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masagos Zulkifli, as well as rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the business com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said she was glad to see trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers of com­merce at­tend­ing the launch. “As mul­ti­pli­ers with large em­ployer net­works, you can make a tremen­dous dif­fer­ence by work­ing with SG En­able to pro­mote dis­abil­ity em­ploy­ment and the En­abling Mark to your mem­bers,” she said.</p>
    <p>She sug­gested that busi­nesses in the heart­land could pro­vide jobs to those with dis­abil­i­ties liv­ing around the area, thereby min­imis­ing the need for them to travel.</p>
    <p>She also sug­gested that com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment coun­cils could help match jobs avail­able in neigh­bour­hood busi­nesses to those with dis­abil­i­ties liv­ing in their district.</p>
    <p>The new ac­cred­i­ta­tion frame­work fol­lowed Madam Hal­imah’s launch in March of the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge En­abling Em­ploy­ment Pledge, which was aimed at ral­ly­ing em­ploy­ers to pro­vide more em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties to peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>More than 140 em­ploy­ers have since made the pledge.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Madam Hal­imah high­lighted South Korean-style bar­be­cue restau­rant chain Seoul Gar­den Group, which in­tends to ap­ply for the ac­cred­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Ten per cent of its staff are peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, al­most half of whom have more than five years of ser­vice, in­di­cat­ing a pos­i­tive staff re­ten­tion rate and strong in­clu­sive cul­ture, she said.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble for the En­abling Mark, an or­gan­i­sa­tion must be Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered as well as reg­is­tered as an em­ployer with SG En­able. It must also cur­rently hire peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion will then be as­sessed in six cat­e­gories – lead­er­ship, cul­ture and cli­mate; re­cruit­ment prac­tices; work­place ac­ces­si­bil­ity and ac­com­mo­da­tion; em­ploy­ment prac­tices; com­mu­nity en­gage­ment and pro­mo­tion; and ex­tent of in­clu­sive hir­ing.</p>
    <p>It will then re­ceive the En­abling Mark, which has three tiers – plat­inum, gold and silver. Plat­inum will be valid for three years, gold for two and silver for one.</p>
    <p>An­other com­pany that in­tends to ap­ply for the En­abling Mark is events agency Adrenalin Group, which hired its first per­son with dis­abil­ity in 2011.</p>
    <p>It now em­ploys three peo­ple with phys­i­cal dis­abil­i­ties – one­sixth of its to­tal staff strength of 18 – work­ing as a video editor, of­fice man­ager and cleaner, said man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Richardo Chua.</p>
    <p>“We hope the mark will tell us, okay, we are on the right track. Since we’ve been do­ing this – in­clu­sive hir­ing – for a while now, we just want to make sure we are re­ally do­ing what we say we do,” he said.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Masagos pointed out that as an in­clu­sive em­ployer, hir­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties is not just an act of char­ity, but a good business de­ci­sion as well. He said: “I hope that one day, em­ploy­ers will come to see this En­abling Mark not as a form of spe­cial recog­ni­tion, but as a new norm for em­ploy­ment.”</p>
