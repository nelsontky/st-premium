    <p>Call it the nos­tal­gia or sym­pa­thy ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Ap­proval rat­ings for out­go­ing Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s Cab­i­net soared in two sep­a­rate polls over the week­end. The num­bers went up by 27 points to 62.4 per cent in a sur­vey by the Japan News Net­work (JNN), and by 15 points to 52 per cent in an­other by the Yomi­uri news­pa­per. In an anal­y­sis of the re­sults, the Yomi­uri called the sig­nif­i­cant bump an “un­usual oc­cur­rence”.</p>
    <p>It is also the first time since March that sup­port has ex­ceeded dis­ap­proval in the news­pa­per’s monthly poll.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s pre­ferred suc­ces­sor, Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, 71, also gained ground among the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>He leapfrogge­d for­mer de­fence min­is­ter Shigeru Ishiba, 63, who has led polls as the pub­lic’s favoured prime min­is­ter for years, for the first time.</p>
    <p>This surge in sup­port to lev­els rarely seen since Mr Abe took of­fice in De­cem­ber 2012 comes de­spite months of pub­lic cas­ti­ga­tion over the gov­ern­ment’s botched man­age­ment of the Covid-19 pan­demic that sank his ap­proval rat­ings.</p>
    <p>Add to that a spate of scan­dals in the past 12 months alone: al­le­ga­tions he wined and dined his con­stituents at a tax­payer-funded sakura (cherry blos­soms) gar­den party; the ar­rest of a hand­picked for­mer jus­tice min­is­ter for al­legedly buy­ing votes for his wife to win an elec­tion; and the ill-fated gam­ble to ex­tend the re­tire­ment age of se­lected prose­cu­tors, which back­fired af­ter the in­tended ben­e­fi­ciary quit over gam­bling woes.</p>
    <p>All of these caused a ma­jor pub­lic up­roar and left his ap­proval rat­ings lan­guish­ing at around 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The only thing that changed is Abe’s res­ig­na­tion,” Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano told The Straits Times. “It’s not as if the gov­ern­ment has come up with rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent poli­cies.”</p>
    <p>But what has soft­ened hearts and minds is Mr Abe’s pal­lor at the news con­fer­ence to an­nounce that he was quit­ting over the flare-up of a chronic di­ges­tive con­di­tion, which can be in­duced by stress.</p>
    <p>He also ap­peared re­signed to not be­ing able to com­pletely ful­fil his tar­gets.</p>
    <p>Since then, a vast ma­jor­ity have be­gun to look back favourably on Mr Abe’s ten­ure as prime min­is­ter since De­cem­ber 2012. A poll by the lib­eral Asahi news­pa­per – which tends to be crit­i­cal of the Abe ad­min­is­tra­tion – last week showed that 71 per cent eval­u­ated his ten­ure pos­i­tively over­all, even though half felt that he did not ex­er­cise lead­er­ship in the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>This view was echoed in the JNN sur­vey, with 62.4 per cent eval­u­at­ing Mr Abe’s ten­ure pos­i­tively, and the Yomi­uri, with 74 per cent. A ma­jor­ity in all three polls felt he in­creased Japan’s pres­ence in the diplo­matic arena.</p>
    <p>The me­dia sur­veys come as elec­tion cam­paign­ing to choose the new pres­i­dent of the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) of­fi­cially kicks off to­day. Mr Suga is the run­away favourite, hav­ing se­cured votes from at least 70 per cent of the LDP’s law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>His two op­po­nents are Mr Ishiba and Mr Fu­mio Kishida, 63, the LDP’s pol­icy coun­cil chair­man and for­merly a for­eign min­is­ter. Mr Kishida was once Mr Abe’s favoured suc­ces­sor, but has lost back­ing due to con­cerns over his lack of pub­lic pres­ence.</p>
    <p>In the elec­tion next Mon­day to choose Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor, 535 votes will be cast by the LDP’s 394 law­mak­ers in the Diet or Par­lia­ment, with three del­e­gate votes given to each of the 47 pre­fec­ture chap­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who is seen as the con­ti­nu­ity can­di­date, has made pol­icy pledges in­clud­ing a con­tin­u­a­tion of the ul­tra-easy mon­e­tary pol­icy un­der Abe­nomics, and has promised to re­form the Health Min­istry to bet­ter deal with pan­demics such as Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The swing in pub­lic sup­port to­wards Mr Suga could jeop­ar­dise Mr Ishiba’s cam­paign, who was ex­pected to do well in lo­cal pre­fec­tural votes.</p>
    <p>“Ishiba needs to earn votes from LDP’s lo­cal of­fices in or­der to main­tain his rep­u­ta­tion,” said Dr Sota Kato of the Tokyo Foun­da­tion for Pub­lic Re­search think-tank.</p>
    <p>And if Mr Ishiba does not man­age to do so, Dr Nakano said: “A to­tal vic­tory for Suga could hap­pen, and that might spell the end of Ishiba’s career. He needs to show that he can still be a ri­val wait­ing in the wings.”</p>
    <p>A snap elec­tion may be im­mi­nent if Mr Suga wishes to ride on the wave of sup­port, Dr Nakano added.</p>
    <p>The me­dia has spec­u­lated that Oct 25 will be the likely poll date, though an elec­tion must be called only by Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
    <p>LDP gen­eral af­fairs chair­man Shu­nichi Suzuki said on a news pro­gramme on Sun­day: “It is pos­si­ble (a snap poll) will be timed to seek voter re­sponse when a new Cab­i­net is launched and sup­port is likely to be high.”</p>
