    <p>• The chief of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has re­jected as false an al­le­ga­tion by US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo that he owed his po­si­tion to a deal with China.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo had told a pri­vate meet­ing of Bri­tish law­mak­ers on Tues­day that the WHO had be­come a “po­lit­i­cal” body, al­leg­ing that its de­ci­sions were in­flu­enced by a deal struck be­tween di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus and China that helped him be­come its head, ac­cord­ing to quotes in The Times and The Daily Tele­graph.</p>
    <p>“When push came to shove, when it re­ally mat­tered most”, peo­ple died “be­cause of the deal that was made”, he claimed.</p>
    <p>When asked about Mr Pom­peo’s al­le­ga­tions dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence, Dr Te­dros said on Thurs­day that they were “un­true and un­ac­cept­able and with­out any foun­da­tion for that mat­ter”.</p>
    <p>He in­sisted the “sole fo­cus... of the en­tire or­gan­i­sa­tion is on sav­ing lives” and the “WHO will not be dis­tracted by these com­ments and we don’t want the en­tire in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity also to be dis­tracted”.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated his warn­ing that one of the great­est threats in the cur­rent cri­sis is the “politi­ci­sa­tion of the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros has for months faced re­lent­less at­tacks from US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has ac­cused the WHO of botch­ing the global coro­n­avirus re­sponse and of be­ing a “pup­pet of China”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Mr Trump made good on his threat to be­gin with­draw­ing the United States – tra­di­tion­ally the WHO’s largest donor – from the or­gan­i­sa­tion, even as it works to co­or­di­nate the global re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, who is Covid-19 tech­ni­cal lead at the WHO, and an Amer­i­can cit­i­zen, also pushed back on Thurs­day against the charges lobbed against the United Na­tions agency.</p>
    <p>“I see first-hand every day the work that Dr Te­dros does... that our teams do, all over the world,” she</p>
    <p>WHO chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus in­sisted that the “sole fo­cus... of the en­tire or­gan­i­sa­tion is on sav­ing lives” and that the “WHO will not be dis­tracted by these com­ments and we don’t want the en­tire in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity also to be dis­tracted”.</p>
    <p>said, in­sist­ing that the en­tire or­gan­i­sa­tion was “firmly fo­cused on sav­ing lives”.</p>
    <p>Also at Thurs­day’s press con­fer­ence, Dr Te­dros stressed the im­por­tance of in­di­vid­ual re­spon­si­bil­ity in the battle against Covid-19, point­ing to a spate of out­breaks linked to night­clubs and so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>“It may not be your life, but your choices could be the dif­fer­ence be­tween life and death for some­one you love, or for a com­plete stranger,” he said. “We all have a part to play in pro­tect­ing our­selves and one an­other.”</p>
