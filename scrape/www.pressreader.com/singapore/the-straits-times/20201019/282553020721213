    <p>Don’t mess with Don­nie Yen.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong ac­tion star has suc­cess­fully fought back against a Chi­nese movie com­pany that had ac­cused him of prima donna be­hav­iour dur­ing the mak­ing of a movie.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, the Shaanx­ibased West Movie Group posted an apol­ogy on­line, af­ter the 57-yearold ac­tor won a law­suit against the com­pany for defama­tion.</p>
    <p>The case arose over the per­for­mance of the com­pany’s movie Ice­man: The Time Trav­eller, which starred Yen, Wang Bao­qiang, Eva Huang and Si­mon Yam, and opened in Novem­ber 2018. It was panned and did badly at the box of­fice.</p>
    <p>In a so­cial me­dia post soon af­ter, the com­pany blamed Yen for the movie’s fail­ure, claim­ing that he had changed his lines ar­bi­trar­ily, amended what the film’s ac­tion chore­og­ra­pher had pro­posed and re­fused to take part in pro­mo­tional ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the post on the movie’s of­fi­cial Weibo ac­count was deleted just a few hours af­ter it was up­loaded.</p>
    <p>Yen, known for the Ip Man mar­tial-arts movies (2008 to 2019), de­fended him­self in a 2,000-word post and called the ac­cu­sa­tions “base­less” and “ma­li­cious slan­der”.</p>
    <p>He asked if the pro­duc­ers were try­ing to shift the blame to the ac­tors af­ter the movie’s dis­mal per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“Why was a se­quel to a movie filmed five years ago re­leased only now? The rea­son should be very clear to the movie pro­ducer,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yen’s agency fol­lowed up by su­ing West Movie Group for defama­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter nearly two years, the ac­tor has fi­nally won his case.</p>
    <p>The movie com­pany was or­dered to post an apol­ogy let­ter on its two of­fi­cial Weibo ac­counts be­fore last Fri­day, which would have to re­main on­line for 30 con­sec­u­tive days – fail­ing which it would have to pay Yen 500,000 yuan (S$101,400).</p>
    <p>Yen’s agency said last Fri­day that the ac­tor and his team re­spect the court judg­ment, though the apol­ogy can­not make up for the dam­age to Yen’s rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
