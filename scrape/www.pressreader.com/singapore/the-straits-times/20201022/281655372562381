    <p>The KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH) has con­ducted six stud­ies on chil­dren with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The stud­ies looked at how they got the virus, their symp­toms, vi­ral load and how they were tested. Here are the five main find­ings.</p>
    <p>1 Chil­dren un­der five at low­est risk of be­ing in­fected by adults</p>
    <p>Of the 137 house­holds sur­veyed with adults who con­tracted Covid-19, the adult-to-child trans­mis­sion rate was at 6.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>For chil­dren be­low the age of five, the adultto-child trans­mis­sion rate was the low­est at 1.3 per cent, mean­ing this group was least likely to be in­fected by adult Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>2 No ev­i­dence of young chil­dren in­fect­ing others with Covid-19 in pre-schools</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­view con­ducted on chil­dren in three schools (two pre-schools and one sec­ondary school), there was no ev­i­dence of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion among chil­dren.</p>
    <p>3 Nearly four in 10 of the chil­dren who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 were asymp­to­matic</p>
    <p>About 61.5 per cent of chil­dren with Covid-19 had symp­toms, ac­cord­ing to a study con­ducted on 39 chil­dren ad­mit­ted to KKH be­tween Jan­uary and May.</p>
    <p>The high­est pro­por­tion of symp­to­matic cases (75 per cent) were found in chil­dren from birth to four years old.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Higher vi­ral loads were more likely in symp­to­matic chil­dren</p>
    <p>In a study con­ducted among 17 chil­dren, 10 were symp­to­matic, dis­play­ing mild ill­ness with up­per res­pi­ra­tory tract in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>They did not have any symp­toms by day five or have any com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing seven did not de­velop any symp­toms.</p>
    <p>5 Buc­cal swabs and saliva test­ing, though non-in­va­sive, were not use­ful in test­ing for Covid-19 in chil­dren</p>
    <p>Buc­cal swabs, where DNA is col­lected from the in­side of a per­son’s cheek, con­tained lower vi­ral loads com­pared with na­sopha­ryn­geal swabs.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, saliva test­ing also found poorer sen­si­tiv­ity and lower vi­ral loads when used for test­ing on chil­dren.</p>
