    <p>Con­stant adap­ta­tion, re­struc­tur­ing and trans­for­ma­tion have been cen­tral to Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic story over decades, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat told Par­lia­ment, as he high­lighted four ar­eas for the coun­try to strengthen its eco­nomic ca­pac­ity to emerge stronger from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>1 Take an even more in­te­grated and co­or­di­nated ap­proach to eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s econ­omy has multiple stake­hold­ers, and tri­par­tism – the Govern­ment, busi­nesses and the labour move­ment work­ing to­gether – has been a tremen­dous source of strength in the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But there is room for greater col­lab­o­ra­tion, said Mr Heng, cit­ing the Nether­lands and its “triple he­lix” model where govern­ment, busi­nesses and academia work to­gether to build knowl­edge, test pro­to­types, and scale in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore can build on our tri­par­tite part­ner­ship, to be a test-bed that cre­ates deeper link­ages with an ex­panded set of stake­hold­ers – in­clud­ing our ed­u­ca­tion and re­search in­sti­tu­tions, our community groups, and in­ter­ested part­ners from around the world,” said Mr Heng. This can cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans and new op­por­tu­ni­ties for en­trepreneur­s, he added.</p>
    <p>2 Re­dou­ble ef­forts to de­velop ev­ery­one to their fullest po­ten­tial, so that peo­ple can take on new op­por­tu­ni­ties and flour­ish in their cho­sen pur­suits.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, said: “We need a holis­tic ap­proach for this that spans the lifetime of in­di­vid­u­als, from birth to pre-school, to schools, all the way to life­long learn­ing as part of Skill­sFu­ture.”</p>
    <p>He noted that half a mil­lion peo­ple took part in Skill­sFu­ture pro­grammes last year.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has to ex­plore new pos­si­bil­i­ties for de­vel­op­ing its peo­ple fully, Mr Heng em­pha­sised, high­light­ing that the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion is sup­port­ing re­search pro­grammes that ad­dress the broader goal of en­hanc­ing hu­man po­ten­tial through mea­sures dur­ing preg­nancy and child­hood, in­clud­ing nu­tri­tion, par­ent­ing and learn­ing.</p>
    <p>3 Strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s path-find­ing ca­pac­ity to find new bright spots amid eco­nomic dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>On the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force, which was set up four months ago to iden­tify and seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties in emerg­ing trends, Mr Heng said: “The ideas be­ing ex­plored are promis­ing. They range from en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity to smart com­merce, sup­ply chain dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, and the use of robotics. Th­ese can cre­ate new growth mar­kets for our busi­nesses and good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Many hawk­ers and small busi­nesses is­land­wide are go­ing dig­i­tal, Mr Heng added, cit­ing a fruit seller known as “Ah Boy” who op­er­ates a stall in the market at Block 58 New Up­per Changi Road. The hawker also sells his fruits on­line and takes or­ders through text mes­sag­ing ser­vice What­sApp.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Sin­ga­pore will invest in i ncu­bat­ing and ac­cel­er­at­ing start-ups, and sup­port­ing es­tab­lished com­pa­nies to ex­pand their re­search and de­vel­op­ment to build com­pet­i­tive strengths, he said.</p>
    <p>4 Find new ways to be a vi­tal node with rich and deep in­ter­con­nec­tions with the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>Be­ing open is Sin­ga­pore’s strength and op­por­tu­nity as a small city state, said Mr Heng. “We can­not take for granted that, in a post-Covid-19 world, we can con­tinue to be the same kind of hub that we used to be. We must, there­fore, forge new forms of con­nec­tions, such as dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ments, while deep­en­ing our link­ages with re­gional mar­kets to ride on Asia’s po­ten­tial,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also em­pha­sised the need for Sin­ga­pore to re­main open to in­vest­ment and tal­ent from around the world, as he ac­knowl­edged that many Sin­ga­pore­ans are anx­ious about their liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>“Our start­ing point is that our eco­nomic strate­gies must serve the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he said, adding that the for­eign in­vest­ments at­tracted must cre­ate mean­ing­ful jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans and strengthen the coun­try’s cor­po­rate ecosys­tem, and Sin­ga­pore­ans must re­ceive fair con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He said man­power poli­cies are be­ing adapted to chang­ing cir­cum­stances to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore­ans’ in­ter­ests are up­held, but Sin­ga­pore must re­sist the temp­ta­tion to turn in­wards.</p>
    <p>“We can­not close our­selves to the world, or make for­eign­ers un­wel­come in our so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>The best way to serve Sin­ga­pore­ans’ in­ter­ests, he added, is to en­sure Sin­ga­pore re­mains use­ful and rel­e­vant to the world by keep­ing its econ­omy vi­brant and com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>It must also con­tinue to de­velop its peo­ple fully, to have the con­fi­dence to seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties post-Covid-19, in­clud­ing by work­ing with part­ners from around the world.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing labour MP Patrick Tay’s sug­ges­tion to re­fresh and relook the In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Maps’ strate­gies to ad­dress fu­ture chal­lenges, Mr Heng said Sin­ga­pore should en­hance the link­ages be­tween what it does to de­velop its peo­ple and job cre­ation, in the form of skills maps, job re­design, and reskilling work­ers to take on new job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“In par­tic­u­lar, we must also make a de­lib­er­ate ef­fort to de­velop Sin­ga­pore­ans for lead­er­ship roles in com­pa­nies, so that they can take Sin­ga­pore for­ward. Sin­ga­pore, as a re­gional op­er­a­tional head­quar­ters, has what it takes. Sin­ga­pore­ans, in a mul­tira­cial, multi-reli­gious, mul­ti­cul­tural en­vi­ron­ment, can con­nect with peo­ple all around us and build deep link­ages with our friends in the re­gion,” he added.</p>
