        6 | SATURDAY, JULY 18, 2020                                 WHY YOU’RE SAFE IN SINGAPORE Bukit Merah West NPC Commanding Officer DSP Lim shares how the police force keeps the city-state safe C has developed strategies to prevent scammers from preying on people’s fears during uncertain times. “I think the question that we always ask ourselves is, ‘How can we equip or level up the public so that they can detect scams early, and prevent them from losing their money or personal informatio­n?’”
The police force has always been active in rolling out informatio­nal reminders about scams, but DSP Lim, who believes that the role of a policeman is never static, had his team at Bukit Merah West NPC extend their outreach through the use of memes and TikTok videos they produce themselves.
On their Facebook page (www.facebook.com/ BukitMerah­WestNPC) are funny, light-hearted content aimed at reminding people to take extra care of their personal details and avoid falling for scams.
“What I really needed to do was to tap on the vast, latent potential of my younger and social media-savvy officers. By questionin­g and challengin­g norms of traditiona­l government communicat­ions, I had unleashed the energy levels of my officers in ways I did not see before,” says DSP Lim. He helps his men with storyboard­ing and content creation. Since changing their online strategy, the team saw their online reach jump from two-figure views to six-figure views within a few days of posting a new video.
“Police work carries different challenges every day. For me, I find energy in learning how to solve problems in this job,” he says. DSP Jonathan Lim believes the role of a police officer is evolving but the goal remains the same: To protect Singapore from any harm. ar chases. Police raids. Criminal investigat­ions. Thanks to cop films, these are the common scenarios that most people associate policemen with. But in real life, what does it take to keep Singapore safe?
“Most people’s traditiona­l notion of policemen is that they will appear when something bad happens. But police officers in Singapore play a very proactive role in the community to bring down crime and ensure that people are safe and free from harm,” says Deputy Superinten­dent of Police (DSP) Jonathan Lim.
A commanding officer at the Bukit Merah West Neighbourh­ood Police Centre (NPC), the 29-yearold has been with the Singapore Police Force (SPF) for six years. He started leading his current team of 100 police officers last year.
No two days are the same for DSP Lim. He can be called on to lead a team of police officers to respond to an emergency one day, and then on the next, be brainstorm­ing with another team of police officers on how to keep the neighbourh­ood safe.
This year has been particular­ly action-packed for DSP Lim.
He welcomed New Year’s Day by leading an inter-agency operation against a suspect who had attacked a public servant. The suspect had locked himself in a Bukit Merah flat in a three-hour standoff that ended with his arrest. “We had to coordinate with other units to make sure that it was a successful arrest, but at the same time, we had to stop him from harming himself,” he recounts what he described as one of his most challengin­g assignment­s so far.
While others would prefer not to work on public holidays, DSP Lim sees the responsibi­lities as a badge of honour. “I think for all of us – the police force – there’s a sense of pride in knowing that we’re watching over people who are having a good time and keeping them safe,” he says. PHOTOS: SINGAPORE POLICE FORCE “The scholarshi­p allowed me to pursue my dreams of studying abroad at renowned universiti­es and to learn from the very best in the field. I would not have been able to afford such an education otherwise,” he explains. “It allowed me to focus on my personal developmen­t and education, so I can contribute to the SPF and to the public in the time to come.”
What advice does DSP Lim have for young people at the crossroads between scholarshi­p options and career choices?
“If you want a fast-paced career with strong camaraderi­e and a fulfilling daily mission, the SPF is the place for you. For sure, there will be rough and exhausting days, but there will be irreplacea­ble experience­s and an unequalled sense of purpose.” Police work carries different challenges every day. For me, I find energy in learning how to solve problems in this job. DSP JONATHAN LIM, COMMANDING OFFICER, BUKIT MERAH WEST NPC SPF SCHOLARSHI­P PAVES THE WAY DSP Lim says he has always been drawn to the idea of keeping a community safe and protecting its people from harm.
“When I was younger, my idea of police officers is that they are community guardians who watch over society, watch over a space, watch over residents and allow them to sleep safely at night,” he says.
“Now that I’m a police officer, the base notion doesn’t change, but there are several dimensions added to my perspectiv­e now. There is a huge submerged part of the iceberg that the public does not see in terms of police work.”
He applied for the SPF Scholarshi­p because he knew it would offer him a rewarding career with the police force, where he would be given the opportunit­y to protect Singapore and its people.
The scholarshi­p was awarded to him in 2010, just after he finished junior college. He went on to earn his Bachelor of Arts in Political Philosophy, Policy, and Law at the University of Virginia and furthered his studies by pursuing a Master of Philosophy in Criminolog­y at the University of Cambridge. He returned to the SPF in 2014 after completing his studies. MANY HATS, ONE GOAL Not long after the standoff on New Year’s Day, he found himself facing a different type of foe – Covid-19. He has been part of the team that helped to move foreign workers to alternativ­e lodgings to reduce the spread of the disease in dormitorie­s, which saw a spike in cases in April this year.
“Covid-19 added an invisible enemy to the Police’s crime-fighting mission,” DSP Lim explains. “We have taken on the additional responsibi­lity of ensuring the safety and security of foreign workers while re-housing them away from dormitorie­s to stop the community spread. It’s a challengin­g time for the whole of Singapore – but we find in it a stronger sense of mission and purpose to keep Singapore safe.”
With the Covid-19 situation, there has been a jump in reports of online scams in Singapore, especially those related to e-commerce.
DSP Lim, too, is working hard on this front. He PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R . PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
