    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The Queen’s Gam­bit, the buzzy, fe­male-led drama set i n the 1960s chess world, has be­come Net­flix’s most pop­u­lar lim­ited scripted se­ries.</p>
    <p>Some 62 mil­lion house­holds watched the show in its first 28 days, Net­flix said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In the streaming gi­ant’s typ­i­cal prac­tice, it pro­vided no di­rect con­text for the fig­ure, and Net­flix shows have no in­de­pen­dent rat­ings fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Still, The Queen’s Gam­bit is clearly among Net­flix’s more cul­tur­ally res­o­nant pro­grammes in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The seven-episode se­ries is ranked in the top 10 most-watched shows on Net­flix in 92 coun­tries, in­clud­ing first in 63, the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>The show fol­lows an or­phaned fe­male chess prodigy, played by Anya Tay­lor-Joy, who strug­gles with drug ad­dic­tion as she rises to be­come one of the world’s best play­ers.</p>
    <p>Since its de­but last month, searches for chess sets on eBay are up 250 per cent, and late writer Wal­ter Te­vis’ 1983 novel that in­spired the se­ries has re­turned to best­seller lists, Net­flix said in a blog post.</p>
    <p>At Go­liath Games, a toy com­pany that sells sev­eral va­ri­eties of chess sets, set sales are up more than 1,000 per cent com­pared with this time last year, its direc­tor of mar­ket­ing told Na­tional Pub­lic Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Ms Kara Gib­son, a spokesman for eBay, said it has recorded a 215 per cent in­crease in sales of chess sets and ac­ces­sories since the de­but of the show.</p>
    <p>Of the dif­fer­ent types of chess sets, wooden is the most pop­u­lar and sells nine times more than plas­tic, elec­tronic or glass on eBay, she added.</p>
    <p>Vin­tage set sales have in­creased seven times, as have sales for equip­ment, in­clud­ing chess clocks and timers, which are up 45 times since last month.</p>
    <p>Be­fore The Queen’s Gam­bit, said Ms Gib­son, chess sets on eBay were al­ready sell­ing at 60 per cent more than last year, which the com­pany at­trib­uted to peo­ple spend­ing more time at home dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The sales di­vi­sion of the United States Chess Fed­er­a­tion re­ported an in­crease in sales of wooden sets, which can cost sev­eral thou­sand dol­lars, since the show be­gan.</p>
    <p>Mr David Llada, a spokesman for the In­ter­na­tional Chess Fed­er­a­tion, said it was too soon to mea­sure the full im­pact of The Queen’s Gam­bit on chess, but said it was al­ready com­pa­ra­ble to the buzz usu­ally gen­er­ated around world cham­pi­onships, held ev­ery two years.</p>
