    <p>•</p>
    <p>New Zealand’s Ly­dia Ko, a two-time Ma­jor cham­pion who has not won in 21/ years, is</p>
    <p>2 happy j ust to be play­ing at the LPGA Drive On Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The event, which started yes­ter­day at Reynolds Lake Oconee in Greens­boro, Ge­or­gia, was cre­ated to help al­le­vi­ate the fi­nan­cial wor­ries of play­ers, who would usu­ally be play­ing in Asia at this time of year, only for the Covid-19 pan­demic to shut down those op­por­tu­ni­ties this year.</p>
    <p>“We would have all loved to have been in Asia,” the 23-year-old said on Wed­nes­day. “I’ve not been in the US in Oc­to­ber be­fore.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, right now the best op­tion for all of us was to stay within the US. I think it’s nice that we still get an­other play­ing op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be good golf – 2020 has been a pretty tough year for a lot of peo­ple all around the world, and I think for us to have an­other play­ing op­por­tu­nity is some­thing that we’re very grate­ful and thank­ful for.”</p>
    <p>That is true for the world No. 39. “The first lit­tle while where I wasn’t com­pet­ing at the level when I was play­ing at my best, I com­pared my­self a lot to then,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I just got to try my 100 per cent when I’m out there, grind my butt out there and just do the best that I can, and the re­sults hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“A lot of those things are out of my con­trol, so hope­fully, I’ll be able to keep play­ing con­sis­tently well and put my­self more in con­tention and in those po­si­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ko has been do­ing that lately. She shared sec­ond at the Marathon Clas­sic in the LPGA’s sec­ond event after its near six-month pan­demic shut­down and was sixth in last month’s ANA In­spi­ra­tion Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>“I’m do­ing pretty good,” she said. “I feel like after quar­an­tine, the time I spent prac­tis­ing and re­cov­er­ing and train­ing, it was good to see the re­sults kind of show some of that time. Hope­fully, I’ll be able to keep work­ing hard to have more of those mo­ments.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer world No. 1 likes the lay­out here but knows lift­ing a 16th ca­reer LPGA tro­phy will be a dif­fi­cult task. “It’s def­i­nitely not easy to win,” she said. “I’ve just got to, in</p>
    <p>Ly­dia Ko hit­ting from a fair­way bunker at the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship in Penn­syl­va­nia two weeks ago, when she tied for 18th. She has two top-10 fin­ishes this sea­son and is seek­ing her</p>
    <p>16th ca­reer</p>
    <p>LPGA ti­tle. my off weeks, try my best, keep work­ing on the ar­eas I feel like need to be worked on and at a tour­na­ment just be­ing fo­cused and hope­fully have a good week.”</p>
    <p>She had pon­dered re­turn­ing to New Zealand at one stage but de­cided to re­main in her Florida home for now.</p>
    <p>“I did think about maybe go­ing home, but at that time, it was also a lit­tle bit of a risk for me to get on a long-haul flight, es­pe­cially as I’m not (based) on the west coast. Makes it a lit­tle bit tougher to go home,” she said. “Hope­fully, I’ll be back home very soon.”</p>
