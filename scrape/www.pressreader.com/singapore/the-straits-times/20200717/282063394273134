    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung will launch this year’s Skill­sFu­ture Month at the Skill­sFu­ture Fo­rum this morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The Skill­sFu­ture Month 2020, which will run un­til Aug 16, will fea­ture a se­ries of mostly vir­tual and sev­eral phys­i­cal events that will cater to Sin­ga­pore­ans who are at dif­fer­ent stages of their ca­reers and lives.</p>
    <p>With the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19 hit­ting var­i­ous sec­tors, these events will share more about the range of train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able for job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore (SSG) and var­i­ous part­ners, the Skill­sFu­ture Month sup­ports the ef­forts of the new Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>This year, more than 80 com­mu­nity, ed­u­ca­tion and in­dus­try part­ners are par­tic­i­pat­ing in Skill­sFu­ture Month, which is ex­pected to reach out to more than 15,000 learn­ers.</p>
    <p>SSG and its part­ners have lined up a num­ber of events that are de­signed to meet the needs of dif­fer­ent work­force seg­ments.</p>
    <p>These in­clude live we­bi­nars, on­line classes and work­shops, as well as vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tions. The de­tails of these events will be an­nounced soon.</p>
    <p>The Skill­sFu­ture Fo­rum, held at the Life­long Learn­ing In­sti­tute, aims to send out the mes­sage to em­ploy­ers that they should equip their work­ers with the right skills to sup­port their busi­ness growth and trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The fo­rum will also look to in­crease em­ploy­ers’ aware­ness and par­tic­i­pa­tion in em­ployer-rel­e­vant Skill­sFu­ture and SGUnited Jobs and Skills ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>The theme of the fo­rum is Re­shap­ing Your Busi­nesses And Work­force In The Midst Of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus is on how the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has re­shaped the world of work.</p>
    <p>At the fo­rum, Mr Ong will de­liver a speech and par­tic­i­pate in a panel dis­cus­sion on how com­pa­nies have trans­formed their busi­ness and work­force to over­come the cur­rent cri­sis through train­ing and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers on the panel in­clude Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Ong Tze Chin, Pan Pa­cific Ho­tels Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Choe Peng Sum, Green­pac chief ex­ec­u­tive Su­san Chong, Ademco Se­cu­rity Group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Toby Koh and HRnetGroup ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief le­gal of­fi­cer Ade­line Sim.</p>
