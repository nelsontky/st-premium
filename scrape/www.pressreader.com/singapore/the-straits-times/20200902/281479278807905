    <p>An In­done­sian maid who killed and stole from an el­derly cou­ple in Be­dok in 2017 will spend 20 years in jail in her home coun­try af­ter a trial there for the dou­ble mur­der.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian court rul­ing was re­vealed yes­ter­day in a coro­ner’s in­quiry into the deaths of Mr Chia Ngim Fong, 79, and his wife, Madam Chin Sek Fah, 78.</p>
    <p>The coro­ner’s court in Sin­ga­pore heard that Khasanah, who goes by only one name, was orig­i­nally sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment in In­done­sia but had the sen­tence re­duced on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Khasanah, who es­caped to In­done­sia af­ter the crime, was not handed over to the au­thor­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore even though her of­fences were com­mit­ted here.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the In­done­sian Na­tional</p>
    <p>Po­lice worked with the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF) to solve the crime, The Straits Times pre­vi­ously re­ported.</p>
    <p>Khasanah, then 41, was not sent to Sin­ga­pore due to the prin­ci­ple of per­son­aliteit, which re­quires any In­done­sian ar­rested in the coun­try for a crime com­mit­ted over­seas to be pro­cessed in In­done­sia, in­stead of be­ing sent to the ju­ris­dic­tion where the of­fence took place.</p>
    <p>Khasanah, who came from Java, had worked for the cou­ple at Block 717 Be­dok Reservoir Road for about a month be­fore the mur­ders.</p>
    <p>They were found tied up and un­con­scious in their five-room ex­ec­u­tive flat on June 21, 2017.</p>
    <p>In the coro­ner’s in­quiry yes­ter­day, As­sis­tant Su­per­in­ten­dent Ma­hathir Mo­hamad from the SPF told State Coro­ner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam that Mr Chia suf­fered blunt force trauma to his head, while Madam Chin sus­tained blunt force trauma to her head and chest.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Khasanah left for In­done­sia via ferry from Har­bour-Front Cen­tre at 1.20pm on June 21, 2017 af­ter killing the pair and steal­ing from them.</p>
    <p>ASP Ma­hathir said that af­ter flee­ing, Khasanah was in an In­ter­net cafe in In­done­sia where she was over­heard talk­ing to some­body over the phone about her of­fences.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian po­lice were alerted, and on June 28, 2017, they ar­rested her in Tungkal Ilir, in Jambi prov­ince in Su­ma­tra, af­ter raid­ing her room at Ho­tel Nan­ber.</p>
    <p>ASP Ma­hathir told the court yes­ter­day that Khasanah’s mur­der trial took place in an In­done­sian court be­tween Feb 27 and May 2 in 2018.</p>
    <p>She was found guilty and sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>This sen­tence was re­duced to 20 years’ jail fol­low­ing an ap­peal on Aug 15 that year.</p>
    <p>Rea­sons for this re­duc­tion were not re­vealed in court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>State Coro­ner Ka­mala will be giv­ing her find­ings to­day.</p>
