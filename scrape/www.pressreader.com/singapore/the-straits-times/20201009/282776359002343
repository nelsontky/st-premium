    <p>MUM­BAI • Bol­ly­wood ac­tress Rhea Chakrabort­y (left) won bail on Wed­nes­day, nearly a month af­ter be­ing ar­rested for al­legedly buy­ing drugs for her boyfriend, ac­tor Sushant Singh Ra­jput, whose sui­cide sparked a me­dia storm in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Ra­jput, 34, was found dead in June in his Mum­bai apartment, trig­ger­ing a na­tional frenzy with tele­vi­sion news chan­nels spec­u­lat­ing that Chakrabort­y had driven him to kill him­self with cannabis and black magic.</p>
    <p>A star with many hits to his name, Ra­jput’s sui­cide ini­tially trig­gered a de­bate over men­tal health in In­dia’s multi­bil­lion-dol­lar movie in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But Ra­jput’s fam­ily dis­puted re­ports that he suf­fered from de­pres­sion and ac­cused Chakrabort­y, 28, of steal­ing his money and ha­rass­ing him. She has strongly de­nied the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, a court in Mum­bai or­dered the ac­tress to be re­leased on bail, her lawyer Satish Maneshinde said, call­ing it a vic­tory for “truth and justice”.</p>
    <p>“The ar­rest and cus­tody of Rhea was to­tally un­war­ranted and be­yond the reach of law,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Her brother Showik, who was also ar­rested last month, re­mains in cus­tody.</p>
    <p>Chakrabort­y and her fam­ily have been hounded by In­dian me­dia who have spent months ob­sess­ing over the case, with celebri­ties such as ac­tresses Vidya Balan and Sonam Kapoor ac­cus­ing TV chan­nels of car­ry­ing out a “witch hunt” against Chakrabort­y.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s top anti-crime agency, the Cen­tral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, has been prob­ing Ra­jput’s death since Au­gust, while the Nar­cotics Con­trol Bureau has been look­ing into his con­sump­tion of cannabis.</p>
    <p>The Delhi-based All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sci­ences com­pleted its foren­sic ex­am­i­na­tion ear­lier this month and re­port­edly ruled that the ac­tor had died by sui­cide, not mur­der, dis­miss­ing the spec­u­la­tive claims made by some TV chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The saga has mor­phed into a probe into drug use in Bol­ly­wood, with po­lice haul­ing in su­per­star Deepika Padukone and other ac­tresses for ques­tion­ing last month.</p>
    <p>Ra­jput was un­usual among Bol­ly­wood stars in that he did not come from one of the in­dus­try’s many pow­er­ful fam­i­lies, but in­stead hailed from Bi­har, In­dia’s poor­est state.</p>
    <p>Aban­don­ing his en­gi­neer­ing stud­ies in Delhi for Mum­bai, he got his big break in 2013 and won ac­claim for his por­trayal of In­dian cricket hero Ma­hen­dra Singh Dhoni in a hit 2016 biopic.</p>
