    <p>The world’s largest glove man­u­fac­turer Top Glove Corp is look­ing to un­der­take a bonus is­sue on the ba­sis of two bonus shares for ev­ery one ex­ist­ing share held.</p>
    <p>It said on Mon­day the pro­posed bonus is­sue is meant to re­ward share­hold­ers and let them have greater par­tic­i­pa­tion in the eq­uity of the group in terms of the num­ber of shares, while re­tain­ing their per­cent­age of eq­uity in­ter­est held.</p>
    <p>Shares in South-east Asia rub­ber glove mak­ers have ral­lied in re­cent months, due to ris­ing de­mand amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Top Glove ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Lim Wee Chai said that adding and cre­at­ing value for share­hold­ers has al­ways been a busi­ness pri­or­ity. “This will also en­able us to in­crease the num­ber of shares in is­sue, which is ex­pected to cre­ate more liq­uid­ity and mar­ketabil­ity for Top Glove shares,” he said.</p>
    <p>The board of direc­tors is of the view that the pro­posed bonus is­sue is the most ap­pro­pri­ate av­enue to re­ward ex­ist­ing share­hold­ers while also en­hanc­ing the com­pany’s cap­i­tal base. The pro­posed two-for-one bonus is­sue is sub­ject to share­hold­ers’ ap­proval at an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meeting to be con­vened.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise will see up to 5.48 bil­lion bonus shares is­sued to share­hold­ers whose names ap­pear in the firm’s record of de­pos­i­tors on an en­ti­tle­ment date to be de­ter­mined.</p>
    <p>For il­lus­tra­tive pur­poses, based on Top Glove shares’ three-month vol­ume-weighted av­er­age mar­ket price of RM13.38 up to July 6, the the­o­ret­i­cal ex-bonus share price of the stock is about RM4.46.</p>
    <p>The counter on the Malaysia bourse closed at RM24.94, up 12 sen or 0.5 per cent yes­ter­day. On the Singapore Ex­change, the du­al­listed stock rose nine cents or 1.1 per cent to close at $8.24.</p>
    <p>Top Glove said its bal­ance sheet re­mains “ro­bust”, with a net cash po­si­tion of RM284 mil­lion (S$92.4 mil­lion) and a share­hold­ers’ eq­uity of RM4.7 bil­lion as at May 31, 2020.</p>
    <p>Its last bonus is­sue was com­pleted in Oc­to­ber 2018, when its share price reached about RM11.50. The com­pany has com­pleted seven bonus is­sues and one share split since its list­ing in 2001.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the United States Cus­toms last week is­sued a de­ten­tion or­der on Top Glove’s dis­pos­able gloves, pos­si­bly over forced-labour concerns. How­ever, the com­pany said ship­ments to the US, if re­turned, would eas­ily be taken up by other na­tions, Reuters re­ported on Mon­day. It said it is en­gag­ing the US au­thor­i­ties to find a res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia ex­ports 99.6 per cent of gloves pro­duced and the US is its largest ex­port mar­ket, at 36.3 per cent of to­tal ex­port value in Jan­uary-March, said Reuters.</p>
