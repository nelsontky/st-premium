    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON It was not a vin­tage display on Sun­day, but their 2-0 Premier League win over Arse­nal in the north Lon­don derby of­fered more proof Tot­ten­ham have ma­tured into ti­tle con­tenders.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 11 games, the league lead­ers, ahead of Liver­pool on goal dif­fer­ence, have 24 points in what has been their best start since 2011. What is more, it feels as if more is to come from the side.</p>
    <p>A crowd of 2,000 Spurs fans was in at­ten­dance for the first time in nine months to en­joy their side in­flict an­other blow on the Gun­ners, who dropped to 15th place in what is their worst start since the 1981-82 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Un­beaten in 10 league games, the hosts have now taken seven points f rom Manch­ester City, Chelsea and Arse­nal over the past three games – a run of fix­tures many thought would ex­pose them as im­pos­tors in the ti­tle race.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors en­joyed 69 per cent of the ball but it was ster­ile pos­ses­sion as Son He­ung-min and Harry Kane com­bined for the pair’s firsthalf goals, en­abling Spurs to park the bus af­ter the in­ter­val.</p>
    <p>Hail­ing the team’s pro­gres­sion af­ter fail­ing to qual­ify for the Cham­pi­ons League last term, man­ager Jose Mour­inho said: “We grew up. I can imag­ine lots of peo­ple can imag­ine three matches in a row against Manch­ester City, Chelsea and Arse­nal, would be a mo­ment for us to drop points and go back to nor­mal­ity.</p>
    <p>“But we didn’t go back to nor­mal­ity. We are there. If you do three points, four points from those games it is not the end of the world, it is nor­mal. We have taken seven points.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t con­cede one goal against phe­nom­e­nal teams, of course, we are in a good mo­ment and the team is in a good place men­tally but noth­ing changes.</p>
    <p>“Of course, we are very happy. We con­trolled the game by be­ing de­fen­sively solid.”</p>
    <p>The deadly strike duo of Kane and Son again grabbed the spot­light. They have com­bined for 11 league goals in 11 games this sea­son and al­ready have eight and 10 league goals re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>They have also con­trib­uted as­sists or scored 31 Premier League goals in tan­dem, sec­ond be­hind for­mer Chelsea pair Di­dier Drogba and Frank Lam­pard (36).</p>
    <p>But Mour­inho was more im­pressed with their work rate when Spurs were out of pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>“They are work­ing like an­i­mals, with all due re­spect to an­i­mals, I love an­i­mals,” the Por­tuguese coach said. “They worked amaz­ingly hard when the team didn’t have the ball.</p>
    <p>“Harry was clear­ing balls in the box. Son, in the first 60 min­utes as a winger work­ing a lot on (Hec­tor) Bel­lerin, then as a sec­ond striker work­ing a lot on the cen­tre-backs.</p>
    <p>“They have a very good sense of the bal­ance that they need and they also do in­cred­i­ble tac­ti­cal work for the team when the team doesn’t have the ball.”</p>
    <p>Kane, who at 27 is a year younger than Son, felt they were reach­ing ca­reer peaks, say­ing: “We’re both at an age now where we’re com­ing into our prime in terms of un­der­stand­ing the game and un­der­stand­ing each other.</p>
    <p>“When I’m pass­ing him through and he’s cut­ting in­side and whip­ping them into the top bins, it is an easy game for me.”</p>
    <p>Spurs’ form has given their fans hope that they can fi­nally end their trophy drought dat­ing back to the 2008 League Cup, while they last won the league in 1961.</p>
