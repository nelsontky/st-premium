    <p>PARIS • The former wife of a con­victed French se­rial killer has said he kid­napped, raped and killed a school­girl who dis­ap­peared 17 years ago, her lawyer said on Fri­day, re­new­ing hopes of find­ing a body in one of France’s most no­to­ri­ous un­solved cases.</p>
    <p>Michel Fourniret’s ex-wife Monique Olivier gave key tes­ti­mony in Novem­ber last year, and in Jan­uary said her ex-hus­band was guilty of nine-year-old Estelle Mouzin’s mur­der – prompt­ing</p>
    <p>Fourniret’s con­fes­sion in March.</p>
    <p>But Olivier’s fresh dis­clo­sure – which has re­sulted in her be­ing charged with com­plic­ity – have re­newed hopes of find­ing the school­girl’s body that in­ves­ti­ga­tors failed to lo­cate in June, de­spite a four­day-long thor­ough search of the se­rial killer’s prop­er­ties in the Ar­dennes.</p>
    <p>“Monique Olivier de­clared to the in­ves­ti­gat­ing mag­is­trate... that Michel Fourniret ab­ducted Estelle Mouzin, kid­napped her, took her on</p>
    <p>Jan 9, 2003, to Ville-sur-Lumes to hold her cap­tive, and raped and stran­gled her,” Olivier’s lawyer Richard Del­genes said at a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“In­ves­ti­ga­tions are still needed to dis­cover where Estelle Mouzin’s body is ... but (Olivier) has not been able to give in­for­ma­tion in that re­gard,” Mr Del­genes said.</p>
    <p>There is a pos­si­bil­ity that the search may pick up again, this time in the pres­ence of the se­rial killer.</p>
    <p>Michel Fourniret was jailed for life in May 2008 for the mur­der of seven girls and young women, but un­til March al­ways main­tained he had noth­ing to do with the dis­ap­pear­ance of Estelle Mouzin.</p>
    <p>The nine-year-old dis­ap­peared in Jan­uary 2003 in Guer­mantes, 30km east of Paris, while walk­ing home from school.</p>
    <p>Olivier is also serv­ing a life sen­tence with no pos­si­bil­ity of pa­role for 28 years for her role in some of the ab­duc­tions and killings.</p>
