    <p>VIL­LARD DE LANS (France) • Pri­moz Roglic main­tained the over­all lead in the Tour de France yes­ter­day as Ger­man all-rounder Len­nard Kamna won the medium moun­tain stage 16 – a 164km ride from La Tour du Pin.</p>
    <p>Kamna came good after a long range break­away, de­feat­ing Ineos rider Richard Cara­paz over the fi­nal kilo­me­tres after the pair had been part of a rare large es­cape group.</p>
    <p>Ecuador’s Cara­paz took sec­ond place and Swiss Se­bastien Re­ichen­bach fin­ished third.</p>
    <p>“I’m feel­ing great, it’s an ab­so­lutely awe­some day for me. It was from the be­gin­ning and I knew I’d have to make it to the fin­ish alone, so when I saw that Cara­paz was drop­ping the speed, I thought ‘Now is the mo­ment to go’,” said Kamna.</p>
    <p>“It’s big for me and a re­lief for the team. The step I’ve made this year is so huge and I’m blessed to win to­day.”</p>
    <p>The vic­tory was just re­ward for the 24-year-old who was pipped to the line on the Puy Mary moun­tain last week.</p>
    <p>It was his first Tour de France stage win, and Bora-Hans­grohe’s first of this Tour.</p>
    <p>Fif­teen min­utes fur­ther down the moun­tain, the yel­low jer­sey group as­cended to­gether with only Tadej Po­gacar try­ing to up­set Roglic and his Jumbo-Visma team­mates.</p>
    <p>Colom­bia’s Miguel An­gel Lopez pow­ered past them all over the fi­nal 200m, but was fol­lowed closely over the line with no change at the top ex­cept for Nairo Quin­tana los­ing a lit­tle time.</p>
    <p>Roglic leads Po­gacar by 40 sec­onds with five stages re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Rigob­erto Uran is third, 1min 34sec be­hind, while Lopez and Bri­ton Adam Yates round out the top five.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s stage started after or­gan­is­ers an­nounced that all of the cy­clists had tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in the fi­nal round of tests.</p>
    <p>No rider has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus so far, with the world’s great­est cy­cling race on sched­ule to pa­rade up the Champs El­y­sees in Paris on Sun­day.</p>
