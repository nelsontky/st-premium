    <p>• The restart of golf’s Asian Tour was thrown into jeop­ardy yes­ter­day af­ter the Pana­sonic Open be­came the lat­est tour­na­ment to be can­celled, leav­ing just one event sched­uled for the rest of this year.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials blamed “dis­rup­tions caused by the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic” for the scrap­ping of the event that was sched­uled from Sept 24-27 at the Joyo Coun­try Club in Ky­oto, Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>But, with the bor­ders all but closed to non-cit­i­zens on top of a surge in new in­fec­tions across the coun­try, the cri­sis has ren­dered the tour­na­ment as un­playable.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, Ja­pan has recorded over 33,000 coro­n­avirus cases in to­tal, in­clud­ing just a lit­tle more than 1,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Tai­wan Masters was axed last month, only the Sept 10-13 Shin­han Dong­hae Open in South Korea re­mains on this year’s sched­ule, which has been frozen since early March be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Asian Tour com­mis­sioner and chief ex­ec­u­tive Cho Minn Thant called the lat­est can­cel­la­tion “un­for­tu­nate”, lament­ing the “chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances the world is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in 2020”.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on its web­site, the Tour added that it will con­tinue to work in uni­son with the Ja­pan Golf Tour Or­gan­i­sa­tion (JGTO) and the Pana­sonic Cor­po­ra­tion for the next and fu­ture edi­tions of the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit has been un­able to join United States-based PGA Tour and the Euro­pean Tour in re­turn­ing to play.</p>
    <p>Only four Asian Tour events have been pos­si­ble so far this year, in­clud­ing Jan­uary’s Sin­ga­pore Open, com­pared to 23 played last year.</p>
