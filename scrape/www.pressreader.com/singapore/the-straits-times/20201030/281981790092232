    <p>BULL­HEAD CITY (Ari­zona) • With less than a week be­fore elec­tion day, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump held in-per­son cam­paign ral­lies in Ari­zona on Wed­nes­day de­spite a surge in Covid-19 cases in the coun­try and crit­i­cism that he is pri­ori­tis­ing his re-elec­tion above the health of his sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic that has upended life across the US, killing more than 227,000 peo­ple, is roar­ing back in the days lead­ing up to next Tues­day’s con­test be­tween Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Trump and his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den holds a com­fort­able lead in na­tional polls, which show a pub­lic in­creas­ingly dis­mayed by Mr Trump’s han­dling of the largest pub­lic health cri­sis in US liv­ing me­mory.</p>
    <p>Polls in bat­tle­ground states that will likely de­cide the elec­tion are tighter than the na­tional sur­veys.</p>
    <p>At a cam­paign rally in Bull­head City, Ari­zona, Mr Trump said again that a vac­cine would be avail­able soon. “If I weren’t pres­i­dent, if you had Sleepy Joe as your pres­i­dent, it would have taken you four years to have a vac­cine. You would have never had a vac­cine,” said Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of drugmakers are com­pet­ing to bring a coro­n­avirus vac­cine to mar­ket, but one is not ex­pected to be ready be­fore next week’s elec­tion. A Trump ad­viser said the ral­lies were “price­less”, given Mr Bi­den’s dom­i­nance on the ad­ver­tis­ing air­waves.</p>
    <p>“These ral­lies gen­er­ate sig­nif­i­cant free me­dia cov­er­age that helps off­set what­ever money ad­van­tage Bi­den has. Fox News ba­si­cally runs the whole ral­lies. It’s a great as­set,” the ad­viser said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den raised about US$130 mil­lion (S$177.5 mil­lion) dur­ing the Oct 1-14 pe­riod, about three times the ap­prox­i­mately US$44 mil­lion raised by Mr Trump’s cam­paign, ac­cord­ing to dis­clo­sures filed last Thurs­day with the Fed­eral Elec­tion Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The ad­viser said Mr Trump was typ­i­cally hold­ing ral­lies in parts of the coun­try where masks are not of­ten worn and peo­ple are less con­cerned about the ill ef­fects of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“If you over­lay the ral­lies on a map, you would see they typ­i­cally run along the same lines of the di­vide over Covid-19. So, re­ally, there’s only up­side.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Kyle Kondik of the Univer­sity of Vir­ginia’s Cen­tre for Pol­i­tics said the ral­lies could back­fire. “More ex­po­sure doesn’t nec­es­sar­ily lead to more votes, and I won­der if some on the fence might be turned off by the to­tal dis­re­gard for Covid-19 pro­to­cols,” he said.</p>
    <p>A pro-Bi­den group, Pri­or­i­ties USA Ac­tion, said its re­cent polling in six bat­tle­ground states found that when peo­ple were told Mr Trump was hold­ing large ral­lies with­out mask-wear­ing re­quire­ments, most dis­ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has slammed what he called the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s dis­re­gard for safety and fail­ure to de­velop a plan to con­tain Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Polls show Amer­i­cans trust Mr Bi­den more than Mr Trump to con­tain the virus.</p>
    <p>“The longer he’s in charge the more reck­less he gets,” Mr Bi­den told re­porters, be­fore cast­ing his own vote in Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware.</p>
