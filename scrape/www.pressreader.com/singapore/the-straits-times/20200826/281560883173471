    <p>Co­bra Kai, the ac­claimed tele­vi­sion spin-off of The Karate Kid movies (1984 to 1994), has been held up as an ex­em­plary re­vival of a hit fran­chise, which it rein­vented by step­ping into the shoes of one of the orig­i­nal vil­lains – and ques­tion­ing whether the hero was all that heroic. Ralph Mac­chio and William Zabka reprise their roles as Danny LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood is lit­tered with the corpses of failed re­boots.</p>
    <p>But Co­bra Kai, the ac­claimed tele­vi­sion spin-off of The Karate Kid movies (1984 to 1994), is of­ten held up as an ex­em­plary re­vival of a hit fran­chise, which it rein­vented by step­ping into the shoes of one of the orig­i­nal vil­lains – and ques­tion­ing whether the hero was all that heroic.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times from Los An­ge­les, its three cre­ators, Josh Heald, Jon Hur­witz and Hay­den Schloss­berg, ex­plain why they took this un­ortho­dox ap­proach – and why they de­lib­er­ately made one of the bul­lies Asian Amer­i­can.</p>
    <p>The first Karate Kid film in 1984 told the story of new kid in town Danny LaRusso (Ralph Mac­chio), who is tor­mented by a band of karate-kick­ing bul­lies from the lo­cal dojo, Co­bra Kai, led by Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).</p>
    <p>Danny then finds his own karate teacher and men­tor, Mr Miyagi – played by Pat Morita in an Os­carnom­i­nated per­for­mance – and de­feats Johnny in a karate tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>Co­bra Kai picks up the story 30 years later, with Danny now a suc­cess­ful busi­ness owner and fam­ily man.</p>
    <p>Johnny, mean­while, is a dow­nand-out, an­gry, un­em­ployed drunk es­tranged from his son.</p>
    <p>But he tries to re­deem him­self by res­ur­rect­ing the in­fa­mous Co­bra Kai dojo and teach­ing his teenage neigh­bour, Miguel (Xolo Mariduena), how to de­fend him­self from bul­lies.</p>
    <p>First re­leased on YouTube’s sub­scrip­tion ser­vice in the United States in 2018, Co­bra Kai was a break­out hit for the file-shar­ing ser­vice, be­com­ing one of the most Google-searched TV shows that year. The pi­lot episode alone was viewed more than 55 mil­lion times.</p>
    <p>Net­flix has now ac­quired the se­ries and will air its first two sea­sons be­gin­ning on Friday, with a third sea­son in the works.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the ge­n­e­sis of the show, Hur­witz says he, Heald and Schloss­berg, who are all 42 and child­hood friends, first talked about re­vis­it­ing the Karate Kid uni­verse in the early 2000s.</p>
    <p>“We loved the movies grow­ing up and had this fas­ci­na­tion with Johnny, the bully.</p>
    <p>“There was an in­ter­view with William Zabka, who played him, where he said he viewed Johnny not as a bad guy, but just an­other kid in this high school with his own prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>This got the trio think­ing about the bul­lies in their own lives and see­ing the world from their per­spec­tive. “And it felt like the themes of bul­ly­ing and men­tor­ship from The Karate Kid films were just as rel­e­vant today,” Hur­witz says.</p>
    <p>The time was also ripe for a nos­tal­gic 1980s re­boot, Schloss­berg notes, with the pro­lif­er­a­tion of stream­ing ser­vices fu­elling a de­mand for shows and films from yes­ter­year.</p>
    <p>“There’s a greater de­mand for re­vis­it­ing the past and we saw that hap­pen­ing and took ad­van­tage of the zeit­geist.”</p>
    <p>Co­bra Kai also cap­i­talised on the fact that iconic films such as The Karate Kid have been watched over and over by many view­ers.</p>
    <p>Hur­witz says: “There’s a real af­fec­tion for these char­ac­ters and our ap­proach was to con­tinue with the themes and char­ac­ters we fell in love with in the past, but find new ways for you to be emo­tion­ally in­vested in them.”</p>
    <p>“Then we in­tro­duce new char­ac­ters like Miguel and, to quote Mr Miyagi, Co­bra Kai is ‘dif­fer­ent but same’. It has a mod­ern point of view and sen­si­bil­ity, a layer of com­edy and a lot to play with gen­er­a­tionally, con­trast­ing the 1980s mind­set with the mind­set of today.”</p>
    <p>An­other un­usual choice the show makes is with one of the bul­lies Miguel con­fronts at school, Kyler, played by Korean-Amer­i­can ac­tor Joe Seo.</p>
    <p>The Karate Kid movies have been ac­cused of per­pet­u­at­ing stereo­types about Asians through its por­trayal of Mr Miyagi and other Ja­panese char­ac­ters, and Co­bra Kai’s cre­ators say they wanted to sub­vert some of those tropes.</p>
    <p>“Hay­den and I cre­ated the Harold & Ku­mar fran­chise,” says Hur­witz, re­fer­ring to the 2004 to 2011 com­edy films star­ring John Cho and Kal Penn.</p>
    <p>“And the rea­son we did was we grew up with a lot of Asian friends who never saw peo­ple like them­selves on the big screen. Back then, most Asian char­ac­ters had ac­cents and were ex­change stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“So we’ve had a lot of con­ver­sa­tions about their rep­re­sen­ta­tion and the Kyler char­ac­ter is an ex­ten­sion of that,” he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“We’ve done a lot of Asian stoner char­ac­ters that felt true to the peo­ple we know, but we wanted to show a dif­fer­ent kind of char­ac­ter and a high-school bully can be an Asian guy.”</p>
    <p>Seo, he says, was ex­cited to play him. “He said, ‘I’ve never had the op­por­tu­nity to go up for a role quite like this.’ And we’re thank­ful for his per­for­mance be­cause he made Kyler a spe­cial and unique char­ac­ter.”</p>
