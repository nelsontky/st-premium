    <p>• Res­cue work­ers con­tin­ued to dig through the rub­ble of a Beirut build­ing for a third day yes­ter­day, still hop­ing to find some­one alive more than a month af­ter a mas­sive port ex­plo­sion shat­tered Le­banon’s cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>About 50 res­cue work­ers and vol­un­teers, in­clud­ing a spe­cial­ist team from Chile, had yet to lo­cate any­one af­ter sen­sors on Thurs­day de­tected signs of breath­ing and heat.</p>
    <p>But they said they would con­tinue while there was a small chance of find­ing a sur­vivor and had nar­rowed their search.</p>
    <p>“Al­ways in search op­er­a­tions like this, you can nei­ther lose hope nor ab­so­lutely say there is hope,” Mr Ge­orge Abou Moussa, di­rec­tor of op­er­a­tions in Le­banon’s civil de­fence, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The Aug 4 blast killed about 190 peo­ple, in­jured 6,000 and dev­as­tated whole neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties held cer­e­monies on Fri­day to mark a month since the ex­plo­sion tore into a city al­ready reel­ing from a crip­pling eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Res­cue ef­forts dom­i­nated lo­cal and so­cial me­dia as the Le­banese were trans­fixed, des­per­ate for some good news.</p>
    <p>The ru­ined build­ing where the search was con­tin­u­ing lies be­tween the res­i­den­tial dis­tricts of Gem­mayze and Mar Mikhael, among the hard­est hit ar­eas by the blast and home to many old build­ings that crum­bled as shock­waves rip­pled through.</p>
    <p>Work was slow, res­cue work­ers said, as the badly dam­aged build­ing was at risk of col­lapse.</p>
    <p>“The build­ing is re­ally crum­bling, it’s scary and there’s a lot of dan­ger to the team,” Mr Abou Moussa said.</p>
    <p>Work­ers were us­ing shov­els and their hands to dig, while me­chan­i­cal dig­gers and a crane lifted heavy de­bris.</p>
    <p>Mr Em­manuel Du­rand, a French civil en­gi­neer who was train­ing lo­cal univer­sity stu­dents, vol­un­teered his ser­vices and was work­ing with the res­cuers to mon­i­tor the struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Scanning the build­ing with high-pre­ci­sion lasers, Mr Du­rand said his team had so far not found any signs of move­ment.</p>
    <p>The area, in a pre­dom­i­nantly Chris­tian neigh­bour­hood, was once home to some of the city’s most vi­brant nightlife spots. Its main street was lined with restau­rants and bars reg­u­larly filled with pa­trons late into the night.</p>
    <p>The de­stroyed build­ing where the crews searched had been part of a row con­tain­ing a Chi­nese restau­rant, a pho­tog­ra­phy stu­dio and a gro­cery store called Twenty-Four Seven.</p>
    <p>Now, those busi­nesses have been erased, most res­i­dents have left their dam­aged apart­ments and nearby shops and eater­ies are closed.</p>
    <p>At night, the area is al­most en­tirely dark.</p>
