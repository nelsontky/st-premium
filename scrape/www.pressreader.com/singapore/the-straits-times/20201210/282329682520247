    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fin­tech in­vest­ments re­bounded in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year to US$278 mil­lion (S$371 mil­lion), 4.1 times the US$68 mil­lion recorded in the first quar­ter, the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech As­so­ci­a­tion (SFA) and man­age­ment con­sult­ing firm Oliver Wy­man said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Although the Covid-19 pan­demic re­sulted in a fall in over­all fin­tech fund­ing in Asia – par­tic­u­larly in China and In­dia – Sin­ga­pore’s fund­ing land­scape has been less volatile, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Fin­tech fund­ing in Asia dropped to US$2.4 bil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter, from US$3.13 bil­lion in the first.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the Asia-Pa­cific’s top-rank­ing fin­tech city, with more than 40 per cent of South­east Asia’s fin­tech firms based in the city-state. Its gov­ern­ment has also com­mit­ted over US$200 mil­lion to grow the fin­tech ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>There are over a thou­sand fin­techs in the Repub­lic as of this year, 10 times the 100 fin­techs recorded in 2015. The num­ber of fin­tech em­ploy­ees has also ex­ceeded 10,000 this year, com­pared with an es­ti­mated 1,100 five years ago.</p>
    <p>SFA and Oliver Wy­man also found that from 2015 to last year, about 65 per cent of fin­tech fund­ing in South-east Asia was di­rected to Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses, nearly four times the fund­ing re­ceived by In­done­sia – the next largest mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Pay­ment and re­mit­tance com­pa­nies made up 23 per cent of fin­techs in the city-state, fol­lowed by wealth man­age­ment and cap­i­tal mar­ket fin­techs (22 per cent).</p>
    <p>Both par­ties sur­veyed more than 60 fin­tech firms – the ma­jor­ity of which are Sin­ga­pore-based. It also con­ducted more than 30 in­ter­views with in­dus­try par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing launched the re­port on Tues­day as part of the Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>An­other re­port re­leased yes­ter­day noted that of the 95 fund­ing deals in the first three quar­ters of this year, al­most two-thirds of these deals went to fin­tech firms in Sin­ga­pore. This is the largest among the six Asean economies, namely In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Sin­ga­pore, Thai­land and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The re­port by United Over­seas Bank, PwC Sin­ga­pore and SFA also found that four in five fin­tech firms in Asean will push ahead with their ex­pan­sion plans in the next two years de­spite dis­rup­tions brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
