    <p>RACE 1 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>9 Su­per Win­ner has some abil­ity. He just might be able to roll for­ward and pinch this small con­test.</p>
    <p>3 Dol­lar Re­ward won back-to­back con­tests over this course and dis­tance last term.</p>
    <p>7 Su­per Kin caught the eye in a re­cent trial for his first-up task. Strong book­ing of four-time cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>5 Hand­some Rebel will likely play catch me if you can from the draw un­der Karis Tee­tan.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>4 Bun­dle Of En­ergy is un­lucky not to be a win­ner al­ready. If he brings his best to the race, he is the one to beat un­der Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>5 Galaxy Em­peror has taken his time to ac­cli­ma­tise. But, based on a re­cent trial, he might just be ready to piece it all to­gether.</p>
    <p>7 Fire And Gold re­ally hit his straps at the end of last sea­son. He’s go­ing to chal­lenge this bunch if he has held his con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>11 Brav­ery And Power has had the ben­e­fit of one run, which should hold him in good stead for this.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>6 Star Present caught the eye in a re­cent trial. He might be able to catch a few of these flat-footed.</p>
    <p>2 For­tune Hap­pi­ness tal­lied a hat­trick of wins at his first three starts last term. He war­rants re­spect.</p>
    <p>1 Eight Tri­grams got off the mark nicely last start. He gets a handy 10lb (4.54kg) claim from ap­pren­tice Jerry Chau.</p>
    <p>3 Su­per Al­liances, a course-and­dis­tance win­ner, is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>4 Soc­cer Master is look­ing for his third con­sec­u­tive win. He re­mains in Class 5, which is in his favour. He’s ready to con­tinue his as­cent up the rat­ings on his lat­est trial.</p>
    <p>6 Shinealot is racing well, al­beit with­out win­ning. He’s ca­pa­ble of a vic­tory.</p>
    <p>2 Ado­nis has had the ben­e­fit of one run. He grabbed third that day. With fit­ness on his side, he is ex­pected to run a bold race.</p>
    <p>7 Galaxy Racer gets the ser­vices of Joao Mor­eira. He can fig­ure with the right run.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>6 Apex Top moved well in his lat­est trial on the grass at Sha Tin. He’s first-up over a mile but, with the good draw, he can test this lot.</p>
    <p>3 Re­gency Master is look­ing for back-to-back wins. He’s drawn to get the right run un­der Pur­ton. He gets every chance, if he is good enough to win.</p>
    <p>8 Fam­ily Leader is con­sis­tent, with two run­ner-up ef­forts from his last three tries. He’s worth in­clud­ing.</p>
    <p>9 Won­der Ex­press slots in light with only 119lb. He’s also favoured by the draw.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>1 Sonic Fighter steps down to Class 4, af­ter strug­gling in Class 3. This con­test ap­pears more than suit­able and he has Pur­ton aboard.</p>
    <p>2 King’s Race made all the run­ning im­pres­sively early on last sea­son. From the good gate, he gets an ex­cel­lent chance to do the same.</p>
    <p>12 Bul­let­proof has slipped to a com­pet­i­tive mark. He gets a nice draw.</p>
    <p>With no weight on his back, he bears close watch­ing.</p>
    <p>6 Gal­lant Crown rat­tled into sec­ond last start, turn­ing his form around in the process, af­ter two medi­ocre fin­ishes. He can fig­ure.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>7 En­shrined grabbed a close-up sec­ond last start over this course and dis­tance. He gets in with a light weight on his back. From the good draw with a pos­i­tive ride, he can take this out.</p>
    <p>1 Will Power soared up the ranks last sea­son, when shoot­ing from Class 4 to Class 2 in seven runs. He de­serves re­spect, al­though he has shown signs of reach­ing his ceil­ing in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>2 Elite Patch does his best on the dirt. He’s con­sis­tent. He war­rants re­spect with the book­ing of Pur­ton. 3 Sil­ver Fig is a classy cus­tomer who is look­ing for back-to-back wins. He won’t be too far away.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>6 Sky Field re­turns fol­low­ing a daz­zling win at his fi­nal ap­pear­ance last sea­son. He’s a talent on the rise. If he man­ages to repli­cate a sim­i­lar turn of foot against this bunch, this race is his to lose.</p>
    <p>9 Mo­er­aki is much bet­ter than his form sug­gests. With a clean run, he can be com­pet­i­tive. He caught the eye at the tri­als.</p>
    <p>1 In­ner Flame is look­ing for his fifth win at just his sixth start. This may look a tough, first-up as­sign­ment, but he pos­sesses some qual­ity.</p>
    <p>2 Smart Leader, a run­ner-up last start, is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>4 Gold Chest scored im­pres­sively first-up last term. He can do it again. He steps out over 1,000m this time, but his past per­for­mances over the dis­tance sug­gest that it won’t be a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>8 Mul­ti­mil­lion loves the course and dis­tance. He is another who won at his first run last cam­paign. He rarely runs a bad race. He is go­ing to find him­self in the fin­ish against this bunch.</p>
    <p>2 Hong Kong Win has crafted an im­pres­sive record of 11 top-three fin­ishes from 14 starts, with four suc­cesses. Mor­eira re­mains. This con­test looks a suit­able start­ing point for his 2020/21 cam­paign.</p>
    <p>14 Team Spirit has the runs on the board. He is ca­pa­ble of be­ing com­pet­i­tive enough.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>13 So We Joy still ap­pears to have a num­ber of rat­ings points to climb. He was slowly away in a re­cent trial, but still man­aged to close off nicely. With that un­der his belt, he should be for­ward enough to win.</p>
    <p>2 Star Of Yuen Long fin­ished sec­ond in a re­cent trial. He’s a talent. With the in­side gate, he should be able to fight out the fin­ish.</p>
    <p>12 Chair­man Lo mixes his form. But, on his day, he’s solid. With the light weight, he should be able to fin­ish off strongly.</p>
    <p>6 Craig’s Star is bet­ter than his record sug­gests. He might be worth a small each-way play, if he man­ages to be a big price.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Gold Chest (left) is go&#xAD;ing over 1,000m in Race 9 at Sha Tin to&#xAD;mor&#xAD;row, but his past per&#xAD;for&#xAD;mances over the dis&#xAD;tance sug&#xAD;gest that it won&#x2019;t be a prob&#xAD;lem. He is the one to beat.</p>
