    <p>In a small coun­try like Sin­ga­pore, peo­ple ap­pointed to high po­si­tions have deep con­nec­tions with oth­ers they may have met through work, in school or dur­ing na­tional ser­vice, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is why peo­ple ap­pointed to these posts must have char­ac­ter and the moral fi­bre to do the right thing, to guard against soft cor­rup­tion and in­flu­ence ped­dling which can be more in­sid­i­ous than out­right cor­rup­tion, he added in his state­ment on Ms Parti Liyani.</p>
    <p>Her ac­quit­tal by the High Court of theft sparked an out­cry among some who asked whether her for­mer em­ployer, prom­i­nent busi­ness­man Liew Mun Leong, had ex­erted im­proper in­flu­ence in the de­ci­sion to charge and con­vict her.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that in­ter­nal re­views by the po­lice and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers have shown there was no im­proper in­flu­ence, Mr Shan­mugam said: “If we had seen any­thing wrong by way of in­flu­ence ped­dling, swift, open, trans­par­ent ac­tion would have been taken.”</p>
    <p>He said the “se­ri­ous, in­sid­i­ous risk” of the pow­er­ful, influentia­l and wealthy en­rich­ing t hem­selves and favour­ing their fam­i­lies and friends to the detri­ment of so­ci­ety is some­thing Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ers have been vig­i­lant about.</p>
    <p>He cited found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew and Old Guard min­is­ter Goh Keng Swee who had warned about the type of ne­po­tism – “the in­sid­i­ous ‘old boy’ type, whereby no il­le­gal­i­ties are com­mit­ted” – that will cause fun­da­men­tal struc­tures to be “eroded like the sup­port­ing beams of a house after ter­mites have at­tacked”.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said: “We have to be very care­ful, to try and stamp it out wher­ever it ap­pears. And make no mis­take, it will keep ap­pear­ing, in big and small ways.”</p>
    <p>He cited the let­ter Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong sends out at the start of each new term of Par­lia­ment to Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MPs to up­hold in­tegrity, hon­esty and in­cor­rupt­ibil­ity and be wary of those who may cul­ti­vate and lobby them with gifts or favours.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam told MPs: “Even be­fore it reaches the kind of con­duct re­ferred to in PM’s let­ter, if we feel that there is some con­duct that re­quires a closer look, we do take a closer look. I am re­fer­ring here to con­duct which is not crim­i­nal, nor a breach of ethics, but which in our view should be avoided. Some­thing that may be le­gal but, for ex­am­ple, leads even­tu­ally to some­thing which is not of so good odour.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam dis­closed that when he had sensed such sit­u­a­tions crop­ping up, he had asked MPs to “have a cup of cof­fee with me” and the is­sue was usu­ally re­solved. “And if it is not re­solved, then they don’t re­main as MPs.”</p>
    <p>He also said the Gov­ern­ment has not and will not try to stop or in­ter­vene if any MP is in­ves­ti­gated and cen­sured over crim­i­nal be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s small­ness presents a more “chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment” in man­ag­ing con­nec­tions and in­ter­ac­tions among those in po­si­tions of in­flu­ence, he noted.</p>
    <p>“We will al­ways have to be very care­ful, al­ways re­mem­ber we are fidu­cia­ries,” he said. “It is crit­i­cal that what­ever the re­la­tion­ship, the Gov­ern­ment main­tains high stan­dards of pro­bity, of con­duct, so that de­ci­sions are made on ob­jec­tive and im­par­tial assess­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam warned that where in­flu­ence ped­dling has been al­lowed, big busi­nesses have been able to in­flu­ence poli­cies through ag­gres­sive lob­by­ing, in some cases even leading to “state cap­ture”, a type of cor­rup­tion in which busi­nesses are able to take con­trol of state as­sets for their ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>He cited the United States, where in­flu­ence ped­dling is ac­cepted as part and par­cel of pol­i­tics, and South Africa’s graft scan­dals in­volv­ing for­mer pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma and the wealthy Gupta broth­ers.</p>
    <p>En­sur­ing the sys­tem stays clean is a crit­i­cal ques­tion for Sin­ga­pore, he said. “We have a me­dia that high­lights these is­sues. See the num­ber of ar­ti­cles that have ap­peared on this mat­ter,” he said. “A well-ed­u­cated, aware pop­u­la­tion that holds us ac­count­able. And Par­lia­ment, where we have these is­sues to be openly dis­cussed, de­bated.”</p>
    <p>But these fac­tors are also present in many coun­tries where in­flu­ence ped­dling is a can­cer, he said, adding that Sin­ga­pore has had in its three prime min­is­ters the strong will to en­sure a clean sys­tem, and the de­ci­sive­ness to act when some­thing goes wrong.</p>
    <p>“The rot starts at the top. If the top is clean, the sys­tem can work well. And we’ve got to make sure of that. If it starts, then very few things can save such a coun­try.”</p>
