    <p>While the lat­est Na­tional Wages Coun­cil (NWC) guide­lines give em­ploy­ers some flex­i­bil­ity to man­age wage costs, their im­ple­men­ta­tion may prove tricky, say busi­ness as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially so for small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs), which are more likely to lack the re­sources needed to ad­here to the guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Among other rec­om­men­da­tions, from Nov 1 to June 30 next year, em­ploy­ers are en­cour­aged to im­ple­ment tem­po­rary pay cuts us­ing the flex­i­ble wage sys­tem (FWS) if it helps to avoid re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Ho Meng Kit said the guide­lines achieve a “good bal­ance” in a dif­fi­cult and com­plex sit­u­a­tion, and al­low em­ploy­ers flex­i­bil­ity in manag­ing wage costs. But the way em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees im­ple­ment the guide­lines in the months ahead is cru­cial.</p>
    <p>Mu­tual trust and an at­ti­tude of give-and-take must be adopted by all par­ties, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Rose Tong agreed: “The guide­lines send a strong sig­nal to the lo­cal work­force that all is not well, and that sac­ri­fices are nec­es­sary to keep the com­pany go­ing so that they can, in turn, re­tain their jobs.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, SMEs that have not im­ple­mented the FWS may find it chal­leng­ing to do so now, es­pe­cially while try­ing to keep the busi­ness afloat, said Mr Ang Yuit, vice-pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises. “In larger com­pa­nies, they would have a hu­man re­sources depart­ment. In SMEs, it is usu­ally one per­son han­dling the pay­roll, bonuses, cal­cu­lat­ing leave and so on,” he said.</p>
    <p>“To im­ple­ment FWS, that would mean re­struc­tur­ing the salary struc­ture of the com­pany and hav­ing the re­sources to craft out the de­tails.”</p>
    <p>The NWC has been rec­om­mend­ing em­ploy­ers to adopt the FWS since 1986. A Min­istry of Man­power sur­vey found that in 2018, about 88 per cent of pri­vate sec­tor em­ploy­ees have “some form” of FWS.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo Yong Aik, manag­ing di­rec­tor of event man­age­ment com­pany Neo.TM, said he has avoided re­trench­ing his 23 em­ploy­ees by cut­ting their wages by 50 per cent since the out­break of the coro­n­avirus. In turn, his staff work only for two weeks each time, be­fore tak­ing another two weeks off.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects the worst is yet to come, as the amount of wage sub­si­dies from the Jobs Sup­port Scheme that his firm gets is down from 75 per cent to 50 per cent for wages paid from Septem­ber to December this year. “If we don’t make our ex­pected rev­enue by December, we just might have to go there (re­trench­ments),” said Mr Neo.</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CULT TO DO IT NOW In larger com­pa­nies, they would have a hu­man re­sources depart­ment. In SMEs, it is usu­ally one per­son han­dling the pay­roll, bonuses, cal­cu­lat­ing leave and so on. To im­ple­ment FWS, that would mean re­struc­tur­ing the salary struc­ture of the com­pany and hav­ing the re­sources to craft out the de­tails. MR ANG YUIT, vice-pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises, say­ing that SMEs that have not im­ple­mented the flex­i­ble wage sys­tem may find it chal­leng­ing to do so now, es­pe­cially while try­ing to keep the busi­ness afloat.</p>
