    <p>HONG KONG • JD Health In­ter­na­tional saw its stock soar 65 per cent above its is­sue price in its Hong Kong trad­ing de­but yes­ter­day, as in­vestors bet on the growth prospects of a health­care busi­ness boosted by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>JD Health is a sub­sidiary of ecom­merce gi­ant JD.com spe­cial­is­ing in on­line med­i­cal con­sul­ta­tion and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sales.</p>
    <p>It was among a host of plat­forms of­fer­ing con­sul­ta­tion for Covid-19 symp­toms dur­ing the height of China’s coro­n­avirus out­break ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has had a “rev­o­lu­tion­ary im­pact” on health­care as both pa­tients and doc­tors are now more will­ing to seek and pro­vide treat­ment over the In­ter­net, chief ex­ec­u­tive Xin Li­jun told re­porters at a brief­ing in Bei­jing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>JD Health’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) prospec­tus showed a 36 per cent on-year growth in an­nual ac­tive users at 72.5 mil­lion at end-June.</p>
    <p>The com­pany sold shares in its IPO for HK$70.58 each, pulling in US$3.48 bil­lion (S$4.66 bil­lion) and a val­u­a­tion of US$29 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The stock opened at HK$94.50 be­fore reach­ing as high as HK$116.80, push­ing the firm’s val­u­a­tion be­yond US$40 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The stock, Hong Kong’s most ac­tively traded stock by turnover, bucked a down­ward trend in the broader lo­cal mar­ket with the bench­mark Hang Seng In­dex down 0.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Kingston Se­cu­ri­ties ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of re­search Dickie Wong said a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of such size should see JD Health fast-tracked into the Shang­hai Hong Kong Stock Con­nect and Hang Seng tech­nol­ogy in­dex.</p>
    <p>“In­vestors are think­ing they don’t want to wait to buy,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Once the stock moves into the tech in­dex, then in­dex funds have to buy it no mat­ter what they think of the com­pany, so in­vestors are tak­ing ad­van­tage of the likely move now.”</p>
    <p>Ever­bright Sun Hung Kai re­search an­a­lyst Kenny Ng said that the de­but trad­ing pop could make the stock vul­ner­a­ble to a swift sell­off.</p>
    <p>“JD Health pro­vides a good op­por­tu­nity for profit-tak­ing in the short term if its share price is above HK$100 since IPO in­vestors have al­ready got around 40 per cent re­turn,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Xin said JD Health might spend some of the IPO funds buy­ing bricks-and-mor­tar phar­ma­cies.</p>
    <p>“In­vest­ment is needed to bring more phar­ma­cies and hos­pi­tals on­line into our sys­tem,” he said.</p>
    <p>JD Health’s IPO was Hong Kong’s largest this year, fol­lowed by China Bo­hai Bank’s US$2.05 bil­lion July list­ing.</p>
    <p>Deal mak­ers ex­pect more ac­tiv­ity dur­ing this month.</p>
    <p>The float took Hong Kong’s 2020 IPO pro­ceeds be­yond US$25 bil­lion from over 100 deals, on track for the best year in a decade, Refini­tiv data showed.</p>
    <p>Adding sec­ondary list­ings – in­clud­ing JD.com’s US$4.4 bil­lion trans­ac­tion in June – the fig­ure stands at US$39.1 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has had a “rev­o­lu­tion­ary im­pact” on health­care as both pa­tients and doc­tors are now more will­ing to seek and pro­vide treat­ment over the In­ter­net, JD Health In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive Xin Li­jun said at a brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
