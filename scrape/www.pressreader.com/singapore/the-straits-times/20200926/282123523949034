    <p>As Sin­ga­pore strives to­wards its goal of be­ing a smart city, it must be sen­si­tive to the im­pact that dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion can have on in­equal­ity, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He re­counted an in­ci­dent at a Meet-the-Peo­ple ses­sion where a cou­ple in­sisted that they had sub­mit­ted an on­line ap­pli­ca­tion for a scheme, de­spite mul­ti­ple let­ters from gov­ern­ment agen­cies that the ap­pli­ca­tion had not been re­ceived.</p>
    <p>“When we dug deeper, (we found out that) they were us­ing a browser that was com­pletely out­dated and us­ing a (per­sonal com­puter) that was a cou­ple of gen­er­a­tions be­hind, and as a re­sult they were ex­cluded,” Mr Lee said. “So I think it’s some­thing that pol­i­cy­mak­ers have to be mind­ful of, but also (some­thing that) com­mu­ni­ties and ad­vo­cates should raise, so that in this new age of dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity and smart na­tion drives, we do not ap­ply a broad brush ap­proach and miss out on vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee also high­lighted how lower-in­come house­holds in Sin­ga­pore faced more chal­lenges with tasks such as on­line learn­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Even as we na­tion­ally seek to har­ness dig­i­tal tools, we have to recog­nise that we must bring ev­ery­one along with us,” he said.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and in­equal­ity at the Den­tons Rodyk Di­a­logue, or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s (SMU) School of Law and law firm Den­tons Rodyk.</p>
    <p>At this year’s di­a­logue, which was held vir­tu­ally, speak­ers dis­cussed the op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges around the rise of smart cities. Th­ese in­cluded in­equal­ity, data se­cu­rity, and the Asean Smart Cities Net­work, a plat­form for cities in the re­gion to learn from one an­other’s ex­pe­ri­ences in adopt­ing smart tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue was mod­er­ated by Mr Philip Je­yaret­nam, global vicechair and Asean chief ex­ec­u­tive of Den­tons Rodyk.</p>
    <p>When im­ple­ment­ing smart so­lu­tions, gov­ern­ments need to make a “crit­i­cal and sen­si­tive” as­sess­ment of needs in each com­mu­nity, and</p>
    <p>BRING EV­ERY­ONE ALONG</p>
    <p>not be “se­duced” by dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies, said SMU pres­i­dent Lily Kong, who was one of the speak­ers.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal in­fras­truc­ture in a city could some­times dis­tract from ma­te­rial needs, she said, giv­ing the ex­am­ple of how a gov­ern­ment may in­stall smart traf­fic lights while ig­nor­ing pot­holes and con­gested roads.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan­tal Bernier, who heads Den­tons Canada’s pri­vacy and cy­ber se­cu­rity prac­tice, also pointed out how dig­i­tal in­no­va­tions can dis­ad­van­tage spe­cific groups.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, sen­sors that pick up on move­ment may in­ad­ver­tently iden­tify peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, who move dif­fer­ently from the rest. “Ev­ery­one else will be anony­mous... ex­cept for the per­son who moves dif­fer­ently. There­fore, (that per­son) does not en­joy the pri­vacy of the oth­ers,” she said.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing his take, Mr Lee said smart na­tion ini­tia­tives are meant to im­prove qual­ity of life and catal­yse op­por­tu­nity. They can even help re­duce in­equal­ity as the dis­ad­van­taged can use tech­nol­ogy to cir­cum­vent chal­lenges, he added.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that Sin­ga­pore’s Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tive car­ries on, it must en­sure dig­i­tal tools solve re­al­world prob­lems and get the buy-in of com­mu­ni­ties that they are meant for, rather than be­ing a “show­room” or “glitzy shopfront”.</p>
    <p>“It’s no point set­ting out a tool and peo­ple do not own it, do not think it helps them,” he said. “Ul­ti­mately, that is crit­i­cal – the buy-in and the own­er­ship of the com­mu­ni­ties for whom th­ese dig­i­tal drives are in­tended to serve.”</p>
    <p>...it’s some­thing that pol­i­cy­mak­ers have to be mind­ful of, but also (some­thing that) com­mu­ni­ties and ad­vo­cates should raise, so that in this new age of dig­i­tal con­nec­tiv­ity and smart na­tion drives, we do not ap­ply a broad brush ap­proach and miss out on vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties... Even as we na­tion­ally seek to har­ness dig­i­tal tools, we have to recog­nise that we must bring ev­ery­one along with us.</p>
