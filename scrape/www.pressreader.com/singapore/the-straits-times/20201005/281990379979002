    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) will con­tinue to in­crease flights grad­u­ally, reach­ing about 15 per cent of its usual pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The car­rier and its re­gional arm, SilkAir, will be re­in­stat­ing flights to Brunei, Fukuoka in Ja­pan, Kath­mandu in Nepal and Male in the Mal­dives in the next three months.</p>
    <p>Flights will also in­crease on some ex­ist­ing routes. For ex­am­ple, SIA will be fly­ing daily to and from Bangkok by De­cem­ber. It will also have daily flights to Mel­bourne by Novem­ber and two flights daily on most days in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Flight fre­quen­cies to other cities, in­clud­ing Dhaka, Hong Kong and Am­s­ter­dam, will also be stepped up.</p>
    <p>All other flights orig­i­nally sched­uled for Oc­to­ber to De­cem­ber but not listed in its up­dated sched­ule are can­celled. Af­fected cus­tomers will be in­formed via SMS and e-mail.</p>
    <p>SIA said in an ear­lier up­date that its pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity will reach about 11 per cent of its pre-Covid-19 pan­demic lev­els by end-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The air­line also said that it ex­pects to be op­er­at­ing at less than 50 per cent of its usual ca­pac­ity by the end of its fi­nan­cial year in March next year.</p>
    <p>SIA’s predica­ment mir­rors that of the global avi­a­tion in­dus­try, which has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Last week, the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata) down­graded its traf­fic forecast for this year to a 66 per cent de­cline, worse than an ear­lier 63 per cent es­ti­mate. It cited the “dis­mal peak sum­mer travel pe­riod” as the rea­son for the revision in ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“Based on flight data, the re­cov­ery in air pas­sen­ger ser­vices was brought to a halt in mid-Au­gust by a re­turn of gov­ern­ment re­stric­tions in the face of new Covid-19 out­breaks in a num­ber of key mar­kets,” said Iata.</p>
    <p>“For­ward book­ings for air travel in the fourth quar­ter show that the re­cov­ery since the April low point will con­tinue to fal­ter.”</p>
