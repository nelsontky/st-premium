    <p>PARIS • Paris Saint-Ger­main yes­ter­day fi­nally con­firmed the sack­ing of coach Thomas Tuchel, who had been at the club since 2018, but did not name his suc­ces­sor, widely re­ported to be for­mer Tot­ten­ham boss Mauri­cio Po­chet­tino.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man was fired by the French tre­ble win­ners on Christ­mas Eve, four months after lead­ing them to their first Cham­pi­ons League final, in which they lost to Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his exit was rat­i­fied only yes­ter­day be­cause of le­gal wran­gles over a sev­er­ance pack­age said to be around £5 mil­lion (S$9 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>“After an in-depth anal­y­sis of its sport­ing sit­u­a­tion, Paris Saint-Ger­main de­cided to ter­mi­nate Thomas Tuchel’s con­tract,” the club said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>PSG pres­i­dent Nasser Al-Khe­laifi added: “I would like to thank Thomas Tuchel and his staff for ev­ery­thing they brought to the club.</p>
    <p>“Thomas has put a lot of en­ergy and pas­sion into his work, and of course, we will re­mem­ber the good times we shared to­gether. I wish him the best for his fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>In his time at Parc des Princes, Tuchel won league ti­tles, in­clud­ing sweep­ing all three do­mes­tic tro­phies last sea­son, but like his pre­de­ces­sors, he paid the price for fail­ing to de­liver the only piece of sil­ver­ware that mat­ters to the board, the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Since the Qatari takeover in 2011, PSG have ap­pointed four dif­fer­ent coaches and their soon-to-be fifth boss – he has al­ready agreed con­trac­tual terms – will be tasked with the same ob­jec­tive.</p>
    <p>It will be a home­com­ing for Ar­gen­tinian Po­chet­tino, who played for the club from 2001-03, and told RMC Sport in an 2016 in­ter­view that it was “a dream of mine” to take charge of the star-stud­ded squad, foot­ball’s sec­ond bil­lion-dol­lar team after Manch­ester City.</p>
    <p>With PSG on a win­ter break, his first match in charge after be­ing booted out by Spurs in Novem­ber last year will pre­sum­ably be the Ligue 1 trip to Saint-Eti­enne next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Po­chet­tino was let go after 51/ years at the Premier League club de­spite lead­ing them to their first Cham­pi­ons League final last year, when they lost to Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>Although he has yet to win any sil­ver­ware as a man­ager, his stock is still high after Spurs qual­i­fied for the com­pe­ti­tion four sea­sons in a row un­der his watch.</p>
    <p>His arrival will please com­pa­tri­ots such as Mauro Icardi, Angel di</p>
    <p>Maria and Le­an­dro Pare­des and he is re­port­edly keen to bring in new faces like for­mer Spurs mid­fielder Chris­tian Erik­sen, who is out of favour at In­ter Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old is also open to a loan move for Spurs mid­fielder Dele Alli, who has been largely frozen out by his man­ager Jose Mour­inho with only one league start this sea­son.</p>
    <p>And ac­cord­ing to Le Parisien, the real block­buster move will come in the sum­mer with Barcelona and Ar­gentina skip­per Lionel Messi his No. 1 tar­get should the for­ward not ex­tend his con­tract at the Nou Camp and leave on a free trans­fer.</p>
    <p>For­mer PSG coach Luis Fer­nan­dez be­lieves that his for­mer team have made a right de­ci­sion, telling</p>
    <p>France Foot­ball mag­a­zine: “He knows the house, knows the club.</p>
    <p>“Po­chet­tino has this style where he man­ages to mix ev­ery­thing to­gether you like as a foot­baller. When you have a coach like him, you want to fight for him, play for him and do good things for him.”</p>
    <p>Still, PSG play­ers like Kylian Mbappe had sym­pa­thy for Tuchel, who de­parts with a 75.6 per cent win rate – the high­est suc­cess per­cent­age for a coach in Ligue 1 history.</p>
    <p>“It is sadly the law of foot­ball,” the 2018 World Cup win­ner wrote on In­sta­gram. “No­body will forget your time here. You wrote a won­der­ful part of the club’s history and I say to you thank you coach.”</p>
    <p>ONE WHO KNOWS BEST</p>
    <p>He knows the house, knows the club... When you have a coach like him, you want to fight for him, play for him and do good things for him.</p>
