    <p>Last Madame, a Me­di­a­corp drama that stars lo­cal ac­tress Joanne Peh (be­low) as a brothel owner, has beaten con­tenders from South Korea and China to be named Best Asian Drama at a com­pe­ti­tion in Bu­san. It won the ac­co­lade jointly with South Korean drama When The Camel­lia Blooms at the Asia Con­tents Awards.</p>
    <p>Last Madame, star­ring lo­cal ac­tress Joanne Peh as a brothel owner, has been named Best Asian Drama – along­side South Korean drama When The Camel­lia Blooms – at a com­pe­ti­tion held as part of the Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>The two win­ning shows beat Kdra­mas Crash Land­ing On You, King­dom Sea­son 2 and Hyena; Tai­wan’s Some­day Or One Day; and China’s The Bad Kids at this year’s Asia Con­tents Awards on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Last Madame – the first M18 drama from Me­di­a­corp – gen­er­ated much buzz thanks to Peh’s al­most nude scene with Tai­wanese ac­tor Jeff Chou, who plays a po­lice in­spec­tor in the se­ries.</p>
    <p>The English-lan­guage 12-parter, which in­ter­weaves a present-day plot­line with another set in the 1940s about Peh’s char­ac­ter, is a story of in­trigue in­volv­ing spies, mur­ders and an old shop­house.</p>
    <p>Peh, 37, who plays brothel owner Fung Lan, posted the good news on so­cial me­dia on Sun­day, writ­ing: “It’s been a year and I’m most grate­ful for hav­ing met and worked with the won­der­ful cast and ded­i­cated crew of Last Madame. Con­grat­u­la­tions @ochrepic­tures, thank you for bring­ing all of us to­gether.”</p>
    <p>South Korean ac­tress Kim Heeae, star of The World Of The Mar­ried, shared the Best Ac­tress award with Ja­panese ac­tress Haru Kuroki of Nagi’s Long Va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In The World Of The Mar­ried, Kim, 53, plays a doc­tor whose seem­ingly per­fect life falls apart when she dis­cov­ers that her hus­band, played by ac­tor Park Hae­joon, is cheat­ing on her.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese ac­tor Joseph Chang, who plays a foren­sic de­tec­tive with</p>
    <p>Asperger’s syn­drome in crime thriller The Vic­tim’s Game, shared the Best Ac­tor award with South Korean ac­tor Ju Ji-hoon, who plays a</p>
    <p>right­eous prince caught in the mid­dle of a zom­bie out­break in King­dom.</p>
    <p>King­dom’s sec­ond sea­son was the big­gest win­ner at the Asia Con­tents Awards, as it also took home Best Writer for Kim Eun-hee and Best Tech­ni­cal Achieve­ment Award.</p>
    <p>The Best Male New­comer prize went to Chi­nese teenage ac­tor Rong Zis­han of The Bad Kids and Thai ac­tor Paris In­tarako­ma­lya­sut of In Fam­ily We Trust.</p>
    <p>The Best Fe­male New­comer award went to South Korean ac­tress Jeon Mi-do of Hos­pi­tal Playlist and Thai ac­tress Plearn­pichaya Ko­ma­lara­jun of One Year.</p>
    <p>The Asia Con­tents Awards, now in their sec­ond year, are given to out­stand­ing Asian drama se­ries on tele­vi­sion and stream­ing ser­vices. The awards re­ceived 75 sub­mis­sions from 17 coun­tries this year.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony, or­gan­ised by the Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val, was held en­tirely on­line this year due to the pan­demic.</p>
