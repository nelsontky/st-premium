    <p>On Sept 21, In­dia and China held their sixth and lat­est round of talks to tamp down ten­sions along their un­re­solved border in Ladakh.</p>
    <p>The marathon meet­ing, which be­gan in the morn­ing and con­tin­ued late into the night, as­sumed im­por­tance as it was the first such ex­er­cise since the for­eign min­is­ters of the two coun­tries met in Moscow 11 days prior to that, agree­ing on the need for de-es­ca­la­tion of troops and arms build-up at the border and dis­en­gage­ment of troops who are al­most in an eye­ball-to-eye­ball stand-off.</p>
    <p>But the ten­sions and stand-off show no signs of a res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The mis­trust be­tween the two sides has only deep­ened in the last four to five months.</p>
    <p>While the over­whelm­ing fo­cus has been on the bi­lat­eral di­men­sions, one equally im­por­tant – and a some­what less dis­cussed – di­men­sion is the man­ner in which China’s in­creas­ingly mil­i­tary as­sertive­ness has had the ef­fect of ex­pe­dit­ing a new world or­der and re­align­ment of forces at the in­ter­na­tional level.</p>
    <p>An idea in the labyrinth of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions takes time to ger­mi­nate and there is a time for it to grow.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing could be truer for the “Arc of Democ­racy” pro­posed across Asia by Ja­pan’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe in 2007. It is an idea whose time has come, to quote a favourite ex­pres­sion of In­dia’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Man­mo­han Singh.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen years ago, Mr Abe, with an eye on China, had pro­posed the Arc as a loose al­liance of democ­ra­cies in Asia.</p>
    <p>His idea at that time was neb­u­lous. But as he stepped down as prime min­is­ter, he may have de­rived some sat­is­fac­tion from the re­cent de­vel­op­ments that saw his pro­posal tak­ing con­crete shape.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing il­lus­trates this bet­ter than two events that hap­pened on Sept 10: In­dia, France and Australia had their first di­a­logue in a tri­lat­eral di­a­logue; and In­dia and Ja­pan signed an agree­ment al­low­ing de­fence forces of the two coun­tries to ac­cess each other’s lo­gis­tics and fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>What is com­mon be­tween the two is the firm fo­cus on the vi­sion of an Indo-Pa­cific where China is ag­gres­sively ramp­ing up its mil­i­tary and eco­nomic pres­ence.</p>
    <p>This is a far cry from the ini­tial days when Mr Abe’s Arc of Democ­racy idea was met with a tepid re­sponse across much of Asia as coun­try af­ter coun­try, in­clud­ing Australia and In­dia, did not want to be seen as too keen about it as they did not want to rub China the wrong way.</p>
    <p>Each Asian coun­try had its own strong eco­nomic en­gage­ments with China. Not that the sit­u­a­tion has changed much now.</p>
    <p>Over the years, democ­ra­cies in Asia, or for that mat­ter across the world, have tended to un­der­play China’s world­view.</p>
    <p>That, how­ever, be­gan chang­ing once Bei­jing came out with its White Pa­per on the Asia-Pa­cific in 2017 sug­gest­ing that ma­jor pow­ers be sen­si­tive to­wards one another and medium and smaller pow­ers stay neu­tral.</p>
    <p>That was the time when China, with a bulging money bag, went about hard-sell­ing its Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI) across the world and its ter­ri­to­rial claims in sev­eral parts of Asia.</p>
    <p>China’s world­view is one to dom­i­nate the in­ter­na­tional or­der by putting in place its own rules gov­ern­ing the in­ter­na­tional or­der.</p>
    <p>The val­ues of a demo­cratic so­ci­ety – in­di­vid­ual rights and open­ness – are not in the lex­i­con of China’s world­view.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing may or may not have fac­tored in that there may be coun­tries which can come in the way of its de­sire to hold sway, refuse to ac­cept its ter­ri­to­rial am­bi­tions, join the BRI, debt-trap di­plo­macy, and look at a mar­itime se­cu­rity coali­tion and com­pete for in­flu­ence in South-east Asia and Africa.</p>
    <p>This is what ap­pears to be hap­pen­ing as In­dia, Australia and France held the tri­lat­eral di­a­logue vir­tu­ally. What is note­wor­thy is that this was the first time a Euro­pean power was brought into the Indo-Pa­cific scheme of things as op­posed to China’s Asia-Pa­cific pic­ture.</p>
    <p>The two main fo­cus ar­eas of the meet­ing were: col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­forts to en­sure a free, open and in­clu­sive Indo-Pa­cific and en­hance the re­silience of re­li­able global sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>This should also be seen in the con­text of Ja­pan and Australia that re­cently took an ini­tia­tive for en­sur­ing re­silient sup­ply chains.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen if France also joins it.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, In­dia and the US are also ex­pected to ink an agree­ment for mar­itime in­for­ma­tion shar­ing that gels well with the over­all Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy.</p>
    <p>There al­ready ex­ists the quadri­lat­eral group­ing in­volv­ing the US, In­dia, Ja­pan and Australia viewed as another fo­rum for en­sur­ing free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>In­dia al­ready has a tri­lat­eral fo­rum with In­done­sia and Australia.</p>
    <p>The com­mon thread run­ning through this sur­feit of tri-na­tion or quadri­lat­eral group­ings is the con­ver­gence of strate­gic in­ter­ests in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>China views the idea of Indo-Pa­cific with sus­pi­cion, with­out apparently re­al­is­ing that its own ac­tions to tai­lor the world or­der have pushed and ex­pe­dited such ir­re­versible align­ments of coun­tries.</p>
    <p>On the face of it, th­ese align­ments are sep­a­rate but one should not un­der­es­ti­mate the abil­ity of th­ese coun­tries in the group­ings with fo­cus on the Indo-Pa­cific to co­a­lesce when the ne­ces­sity arises, be­cause their world­view has cer­tain shared val­ues like in­di­vid­ual lib­erty and a spirit of ac­com­mo­da­tion for all.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to lis­ten to In­dian Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar, who was speak­ing at a func­tion in New Delhi on Sept 18.</p>
    <p>He un­der­lined that the mil­i­tary lo­gis­tics pact be­tween In­dia and Ja­pan is a very prac­ti­cal man­i­fes­ta­tion of the abil­ity and in­tent of the two coun­tries to work to­gether, and ex­pressed the con­fi­dence that “it would be both a big plus for the evo­lu­tion of the Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion of both coun­tries as well as adding to the sta­bil­ity and se­cu­rity of Asia”.</p>
    <p>His re­mark could be an in­di­ca­tor of the shape of the emerg­ing Indo-Pa­cific nar­ra­tive in the midst of grow­ing Chi­nese as­sertive­ness.</p>
    <p>The real chal­lenge for the votaries of the Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion is to sus­tain the ini­tia­tive with­out be­ing dis­tracted by short-term in­ter­ests or change of guard in the coun­tries. Af­ter all, the for­eign poli­cies of demo­cratic coun­tries are un­der­pinned by cer­tain com­mon val­ues and con­ver­gence of in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>China may be go­ing wrong in ex­pect­ing medium and small pow­ers to be neu­tral in in­ter­na­tional power play.</p>
    <p>Neu­tral­ity may not be an op­tion for th­ese pow­ers if they are pushed by China to a cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s Arc of Democ­racy may have been in the in­cu­ba­tor for a long time, but China’s ac­tions may have given that idea a de­ci­sive push to get off the draw­ing board.</p>
