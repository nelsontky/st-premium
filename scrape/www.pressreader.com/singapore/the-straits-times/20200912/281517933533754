    <p>On her most in­se­cure days, syn­chro­nised swim­mer Deb­bie Soh’s well-be­ing was de­ter­mined by what an inan­i­mate ob­ject told her. She stood on a weigh­ing scale and waited for it to re­veal a num­ber.</p>
    <p>Had she lost a lit­tle? Gained a gram? What did she do wrong to be 0.8kg heav­ier? Should she cut her meal por­tions in half? On a few ounces of weight can rest a hu­man’s self-worth.</p>
    <p>“I woke up,” she con­fides, “and I took my weight. I fin­ished with the toi­let, I took my weight. I ate, I took my weight. I drank wa­ter, I took my weight. I’d take it 10 times a day. It was quite ex­treme.”</p>
    <p>Soh was a prisoner of the scale and a hostage to her mir­ror. She’d look at her­self and feel the sting of shame. She’d take pic­tures of ev­ery­thing, her re­flec­tion, her skin­fold test re­sults, and com­pare them across years. She’d take pho­tos in the off-sea­son and put them along­side pic­tures of her­self from com­pe­ti­tion sea­son and ask her­self: “Why did I gain so much? Am I a fail­ure?”</p>
    <p>Don’t think you know about ath­letes, for you can see them but you can’t look within them. If you meet Soh, a syn­chro­nised swim­mer with a “fight­ing chance” to get to the 2021 Olympics with her duet part­ner Miya Yong, you’d see a brave, con­fi­dent, ar­tic­u­late ath­lete, who – see the pic­ture – can grasp a oneme­tre div­ing board, re­verse her body, do a split on the un­der­side of the board and un­hinge your jaw.</p>
    <p>This is strength and sup­ple­ness in all their glory and yet in­side the ath­lete a si­lent strug­gle about body im­age per­sists. Is my body where it should be? Am I let­ting down my team? What hap­pens if I don’t lose weight? For Soh this be­came the hard­est part of a sport she loved.</p>
    <p>Sport is sup­posed to lib­er­ate peo­ple but women ath­letes are of­ten hand­cuffed by is­sues of body im­age. Fans heckle, the me­dia mocks and some coaches hu­mil­i­ate. In a New York Times op-ed, run­ner Mary Cain said that coach Alberto Salazar would “usu­ally weigh me in front of my team­mates and pub­licly shame me if I wasn’t hit­ting weight”.</p>
    <p>Sport has room for ev­ery­one and there is a beauty in phys­i­cal di­ver­sity. And yet gym­nasts and tennis play­ers have been body-shamed and stereo­types en­forced. Soh ad­mits that “part of my body im­age is­sues came from con­stantly look­ing at skinny peo­ple when I grew up”.</p>
    <p>Syn­chro­nised swim­mers are ath­letic artists, their craft of­ten in­vis­i­ble and their workrate un­ap­pre­ci­ated – just to stand up­side down in wa­ter, while not breath­ing and be grace­ful is as­ton­ish­ing. To this sport came an eight-year-old Soh, whose need to ex­press her­self is ev­i­dent in the dance forms she en­joys: Ar­gen­tine tango, Brazil­ian zouk, bal­let.</p>
    <p>Daugh­ter of a big-framed fa­ther, Soh – in the na­tional team since she was 14 – was a flier at the start, the girl in the team who gets tossed in the air. Weight mat­ters in an aes­thetic sport and af­ter pu­berty hers started to ac­cu­mu­late. Bod­ies are dif­fer­ent and hers gained pounds quick but lost them slow. “I felt it was my fault that I couldn’t lose even though I was fol­low­ing the plan. I didn’t cheat at all and wasn’t sure what was go­ing wrong.”</p>
    <p>Through this maze of diet and body im­age, ath­letes need thought­ful guid­ance else hap­pi­ness is leached away. Win­ning may be the end part of sport, but health surely is the start­ing block of any ac­tiv­ity. Coaches must push ath­letes yet “tough love” is an ar­chaic line.</p>
    <p>Soh re­mem­bers a coach, no longer with the na­tional team, who was ob­sessed with num­bers. “If your weight com­pared to the pre­vi­ous time was the same, she’d say, ‘Why didn’t you lose any?’ If you lost weight, she’d say, ‘Why didn’t you lose more’? If you gained, she’d ig­nore me for that train­ing ses­sion and wouldn’t tell me my mis­takes.”</p>
    <p>In 2015, dur­ing a stay-in train­ing camp be­fore the SEA Games, Soh was sent to her ho­tel room by the coach af­ter night train­ing. Sup­per for her was can­celled. “The team was eat­ing and tak­ing pic­tures to­gether, I was alone in my room cry­ing.” Pun­ish­ment can be a les­son or sim­ply bruise the con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Soh, 22, con­sid­ered quit­ting, for this was a dilemma with­out an easy so­lu­tion. “It’s tir­ing to keep ad­her­ing to cer­tain body stan­dards,” she ex­plains, “when that’s not nat­u­rally how you are and yet those are the de­mands of the sport.”</p>
    <p>But per­sis­tence is a ra­di­ant thing and you don’t earn five SEA Games golds and two sil­vers with­out a cer­tain ob­sti­nacy. Soh has en­dured and it speaks of the sim­plest thing: a love for this in­verted bal­let.</p>
    <p>From lit­tle ad­just­ments have come a hap­pier whole per­son. Age has brought aware­ness about sug­ars, salts and the shape she needs to be and time has re­in­forced her sense of self. A nu­tri­tion­ist has helped her un­der­stand pro­por­tions, macronu­tri­ents and the im­por­tance of food groups. It takes a while to know the dis­tinct work­ings of an in­di­vid­ual body.</p>
    <p>Soh al­ways tried to main­tain her com­pe­ti­tion weight but now she re­alises there are sea­sons to ev­ery­thing. Some­times it’s fine to be heav­ier, some­times she needs to be lighter. In her mother’s room sits a scale and twice a day she stands on it. The num­bers it re­veals are still the truth but no longer a bur­den.</p>
    <p>The team was eat­ing and tak­ing pic­tures to­gether, I was alone in my room cry­ing.</p>
