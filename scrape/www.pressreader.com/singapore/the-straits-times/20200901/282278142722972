    <p>The High Court yes­ter­day up­held the ac­quit­tal of two men, who were jointly tried last year for re­ceiv­ing pay­ment in con­nec­tion with the sex­ual ex­ploita­tion of a male child vic­tim of hu­man traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>The case, which is un­der­stood to be the first re­ported one in­volv­ing a for­eign male child vic­tim of hu­man traf­fick­ing, in­volved a then 16-year-old from Thai­land, as well as Tan Boon Chian, the owner of a brothel, and his as­sis­tant Liew Beng Huat.</p>
    <p>Tan was 54 and Liew was 61 when they were both ac­quit­ted in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>There is a gag or­der on the vic­tim in the case brought un­der the Preven­tion of Hu­man Traf­fick­ing Act.</p>
    <p>Dis­miss­ing the prose­cu­tion’s ap­peal to over­turn the judg­ment, Jus­tice Chua Lee Ming noted that the prose­cu­tion had not pro­vided suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to prove the men had rea­son to sus­pect there was an un­der­age boy in the brothel.</p>
    <p>Un­der Sec­tion 6(1) of the Act, “any per­son who know­ingly re­ceives any pay­ment in con­nec­tion with the ac­tual or in­tended ex­ploita­tion in Sin­ga­pore of a traf­ficked vic­tim shall be guilty of an of­fence”.</p>
    <p>In their ap­peal, Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors Gail Wong and Sarah Siaw said Tan and Liew “had both au­thor­ity and op­por­tu­nity to in­ves­ti­gate the pros­ti­tutes’ ages” but did not, which showed they wanted to avoid con­firm­ing sus­pi­cions.</p>
    <p>They ar­gued that if Tan and Liew’s “fee­ble dis­avowal of knowl­edge” was ac­cepted, other brothel keep­ers and their as­sis­tants could “eas­ily es­cape li­a­bil­ity by de­lib­er­ately re­main­ing ig­no­rant about th­ese vic­tims”.</p>
    <p>While the prose­cu­tion tried to make the case that the men were “wil­fully blind”, Jus­tice Chua found that the facts they pre­sented were “neu­tral”, not­ing that he was not per­suaded that the ac­cused knew at least one of the pros­ti­tutes was un­der­age.</p>
    <p>He added that while the Sec­tion “re­quires knowl­edge that the vic­tim was un­der­age”, it “does not pre­sume it”.</p>
    <p>Both men, who are Sin­ga­porean, were al­leged to have com­mit­ted the of­fences over four days from Dec 4, 2017.</p>
    <p>Tan was said to have know­ingly re­ceived $250 from var­i­ous pros­ti­tutes in con­nec­tion with the ac­tual sex­ual ex­ploita­tion of the child, who was a traf­ficked vic­tim at the ma­te­rial time.</p>
    <p>Liew was said to have re­ceived $90 from a per­son in con­nec­tion with the ac­tual sex­ual ex­ploita­tion of the child.</p>
    <p>The charges were brought un­der Sec­tion 6(1) of the Act, which pro­vides for a fine of up to $100,000 and a jail term of up to 10 years as well as up to six strokes of the cane for a first-time of­fender.</p>
