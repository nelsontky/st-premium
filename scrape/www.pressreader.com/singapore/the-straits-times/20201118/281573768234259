    <p>China’s next de­vel­op­ment plan is a re­sponse to ex­ter­nal and in­ter­nal chal­lenges that also car­ries an am­bi­tion to dou­ble the size of its econ­omy in 15 years. To at­tain that goal, it has to make crit­i­cal choices, not least how much lat­i­tude to give mar­ket forces in the econ­omy, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Goh Sui Noi.</p>
    <p>When the drafters of the 14th Five-Year Plan for China’s eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment first sat down to the task two years ago in 2018, the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant was be­gin­ning to feel the heat from the United States.</p>
    <p>That was the year the trade war be­tween the world’s two largest economies be­gan in earnest, with the US slap­ping ad­di­tional tar­iffs rang­ing from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on more than US$250 bil­lion (S$336 bil­lion) worth of Chi­nese goods that it im­ported.</p>
    <p>It was also in late 2017 and early 2018 that the US un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump named China a re­vi­sion­ist power that chal­lenged “Amer­i­can power, in­flu­ence and in­ter­ests, at­tempt­ing to erode Amer­i­can se­cu­rity and pros­per­ity”. Since then, the trade war has ex­panded into the realm of tech­nol­ogy, while the US is also push­ing back against China’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness in the western Pa­cific through its free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions in the South China Sea and the vision of a free and open Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>The man who led the draft­ing of China’s lat­est eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment plan was Vice-Premier Liu He, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s eco­nomic czar who was also fronting trade talks with the US to defuse the es­ca­lat­ing trade fric­tion.</p>
    <p>The 14th Five-Year Plan, or the frame­work pro­posal at least, that was un­veiled late last month and is due to kick in next year, bears the marks of China’s re­sponse to the US’ eco­nomic and strate­gic pol­icy to­wards it, as well as to the over­all ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment that has be­come less favourable, par­tic­u­larly with the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal also ad­dresses China’s in­ter­nal con­di­tions and chal­lenges, and sets out a vision of where it wants to be in 15 years – a mod­ern so­cial­ist state with gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) per capita at the level of mod­er­ately ad­vanced coun­tries, an ex­panded mid­dle class and a greener en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the buzz­words that stand out from the pro­posal are the cryp­tic-sound­ing “dual cir­cu­la­tion” eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment strat­egy that un­der­pins the plan and “tech­nol­ogy self-re­liance”.</p>
    <p>There is some con­fu­sion about what China means by “dual cir­cu­la­tion”. As the Euro­pean Union Am­bas­sador to China Ni­co­las Cha­puis put it at a con­fer­ence last week: “China has coined a new ex­pres­sion, dual cir­cu­la­tion, a lot of peo­ple are still won­der­ing what it re­ally means.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cha­puis saw it as strik­ing the right bal­ance be­tween eco­nomic re­silience and open and free trade, but econ­o­mists have not come to a com­mon view of what that en­tails.</p>
    <p>There is, how­ever, no am­bi­gu­ity about “tech­nol­ogy self-re­liance”. It is about re­duc­ing China’s de­pen­dence on for­eign tech­nol­ogy so that its de­vel­op­ment is not threat­ened by any one for­eign coun­try with­hold­ing tech­nol­ogy from it, as is hap­pen­ing now with the US re­strict­ing the sale of ad­vanced semi­con­duc­tors, as well as the equip­ment to make them, to China.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS DUAL CIR­CU­LA­TION?</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi first spoke about dual cir­cu­la­tion at a meet­ing of the Polit­buro in May and later elab­o­rated on it, say­ing that China would rely mainly on “in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion” – that is, the do­mes­tic cy­cle of pro­duc­tion, dis­tri­bu­tion and con­sump­tion – for its de­vel­op­ment. This in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion would be sup­ported by in­no­va­tion and up­grades in the econ­omy. He also said in­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion would be sup­ported by “ex­ter­nal cir­cu­la­tion” or</p>
    <p>China’s ex­ter­nal trade, which had been a key driver of its growth.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong-based econ­o­mist Ali­cia Gar­cia-Her­rero wrote in a re­cent ar­ti­cle that dual cir­cu­la­tion is not the same as the grand strat­egy of re­bal­anc­ing that China had used in its re­sponse to the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Re­bal­anc­ing then was in­creas­ing the con­tri­bu­tion of do­mes­tic de­mand to China’s growth and re­duc­ing re­liance on ex­ports. It in­volved in­creas­ing im­ports, which ben­e­fited economies that ex­ported goods to China.</p>
    <p>Dual cir­cu­la­tion, said Dr Gar­cia-Her­rero, Asia-Pa­cific chief econ­o­mist of in­vest­ment bank Natixis, is about meet­ing the in­creased de­mand by do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion rather than im­ports.</p>
    <p>Its thrust is in re­duc­ing de­pen­dence on im­ports and in­creas­ing self-suf­fi­ciency, in­clud­ing in high-end goods that would in­volve up­grad­ing China’s tech­no­log­i­cal ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“In fact, the new dual cir­cu­la­tion is noth­ing more than an im­port sub­sti­tu­tion strat­egy while try­ing to keep for­eign mar­kets for Chi­nese goods,” she wrote in Nikkei Asia.</p>
    <p>It was a form of hedg­ing in re­sponse to the chang­ing re­la­tions with the US. This new push for self-suf­fi­ciency, she said, would be detri­men­tal to coun­tries ex­port­ing to China, par­tic­u­larly those ex­port­ing high-end in­ter­me­di­ate goods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Tommy Xie, OCBC Bank’s head of Greater China re­search, said the mar­ket has over-read the dual cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy, which he thinks is a “bot­tom-line think­ing ap­proach which tries to fig­ure out whether the Chi­nese econ­omy is able to sur­vive in the ab­sence of ex­ter­nal de­mand”.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, it is more like an up­graded ver­sion of the slo­gan of boosting do­mes­tic de­mand which has been chanted by China in the past few years,” he said. There is no need for the world to be too wor­ried about China be­com­ing more in­ward-look­ing, he added, not­ing that while Mr Xi has high­lighted the im­por­tance of im­port sub­sti­tu­tion in key sec­tors of the econ­omy, he has also said China would im­port US$22 tril­lion worth of goods over the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>This view con­trasts with that of Dr Gar­cia-Her­rero, who said in an e-mail in­ter­view that the pro­posal re­flects a very neg­a­tive view of the world, es­pe­cially of the West. “China is clearly on the de­fen­sive and that will not help,” she said.</p>
    <p>Another view of dual cir­cu­la­tion is that it is a course of ac­tion that China has to take if it wants to keep grow­ing eco­nom­i­cally.</p>
    <p>Its cur­rent model – of ex­ports and in­vest­ments to drive the econ­omy – is los­ing steam, and growth has been slow­ing over the past five to eight years, noted Har­vard Univer­sity Pro­fes­sor Dwight Perkins, an econ­o­mist and si­nol­o­gist, at a re­cent we­bi­nar. Ex­ports have dropped as a share of</p>
    <p>GDP from a peak of 35 per cent in 2007 to about 13 per cent now. This is as wages rise and China be­comes less com­pet­i­tive in labour-in­ten­sive prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ments in hous­ing and in­fra­struc­ture – as ways to boost do­mes­tic de­mand as a key driver of the econ­omy – are hav­ing lower re­turns, as de­mand for hous­ing levels off, and the coun­try has built most of the high­ways, high-speed rail­ways and air­ports that it needs.</p>
    <p>At the same time, China has a huge prob­lem of in­ad­e­quate house­hold in­come and con­sump­tion – at 38.8 per cent of GDP as op­posed to about 60 per cent in ad­vanced economies like the US.</p>
    <p>“The dual cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy is ba­si­cally a term to de­scribe what ac­tu­ally China is forced to do,” said Prof Perkins. It has to con­tinue to work on tech­nol­ogy to be­come com­pet­i­tive in more ad­vanced fields, in or­der to com­pete in the ex­port mar­kets with other very high-powered economies, he added. He is pes­simistic about China’s abil­ity to boost house­hold con­sump­tion, say­ing there is “not a whole lot” it can do about it.</p>
    <p>But Mr Xie has said do­mes­tic de­mand will in­crease as a re­sult of</p>
    <p>China’s sup­ply-side re­form.</p>
    <p>In April, China an­nounced re­forms in the dis­tri­bu­tion of key pro­duc­tion fac­tors, in­clud­ing land, labour, cap­i­tal, tech­nol­ogy and data, which would fur­ther lib­er­alise its land, labour and cap­i­tal mar­kets and re­move in­sti­tu­tional bar­ri­ers to en­sure a more open and fairer econ­omy.</p>
    <p>New mea­sures in­clude al­low­ing the smooth flow of labour by relaxing house­hold reg­is­tra­tion re­stric­tions, clos­ing the gap be­tween ur­ban and ru­ral land mar­kets, and im­prov­ing the de­vel­op­ment and trans­parency of stock and bond mar­kets.</p>
    <p>All th­ese re­forms are meant to help China tran­si­tion to­wards a higher-qual­ity de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>But tech­nol­ogy is seen by many as key to China’s con­tin­ued growth and this is where the coun­try is fac­ing some ma­jor chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>TECH­NOL­OGY SELF-RE­LIANCE</p>
    <p>As China faces push­back from the West against its ef­forts to ac­quire tech­nol­ogy from abroad – of­ten seen in the West as through un­fair means such as forced tech­nol­ogy trans­fer or theft – it is re­dou­bling ef­forts on re­search and de­vel­op­ment to build its own.</p>
    <p>The pro­posal stressed that China must boost “its strate­gic tech­no­log­i­cal strength and raise the abil­ity of its en­ter­prises to in­no­vate”, and pledged that China would be­come a leader of in­no­va­tion by 2035.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while it is pre­pared to spend as much money as is needed to up­grade its tech­nol­ogy, it may lack enough trained ta­lent.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion re­ally is what is the level of tech­ni­cal skill of the</p>
    <p>Chi­nese pop­u­la­tion,” noted Prof</p>
    <p>Perkins. While China’s uni­ver­si­ties do a good job pro­vid­ing en­gi­neers and sci­en­tists that run the rou­tine econ­omy, they lack the ca­pac­ity to train those work­ing in the fron­tier of sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy, he said.</p>
    <p>China should con­tinue to send its ta­lent abroad to get trained but this will be in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult. The US, for one, has re­stricted visas for Chi­nese grad­u­ate stu­dents with links to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment or the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S CHOICES</p>
    <p>China’s lat­est de­vel­op­ment plan is both a re­sponse to the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment and to the con­di­tions in­ter­nally. It is an am­bi­tious plan to dou­ble the size of its econ­omy in 15 years, which if realised will make it the world’s largest econ­omy. How it goes about achiev­ing this, the choices it makes, and the po­lit­i­cal will to make the wrench­ing changes, will de­ter­mine the success of the plan.</p>
    <p>Some of the re­forms have been talked about for years but with lit­tle ef­fec­tive ac­tion taken.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is the gov­ern­ment’s pledge to ramp up house­hold con­sump­tion. It re­quires not just build­ing up the so­cial safety net to get peo­ple to spend more, but also struc­tural changes to make house­holds richer, in­clud­ing trans­fer­ring state as­sets into the hands of house­holds, said Mr Le­land Miller, chief ex­ec­u­tive of data an­a­lyt­ics firm China Beige Book In­ter­na­tional. Yet, the op­po­site seems to be hap­pen­ing, he said at a we­bi­nar, as China ap­pears to be in the midst of an intense cen­tral­i­sa­tion ef­fort.</p>
    <p>In­deed, while the pro­posal said the gov­ern­ment would “give full play to the de­ci­sive role of the mar­ket in al­lo­cat­ing re­sources”, it also said it would “fur­ther de­velop the role of gov­ern­ment, and pro­mote a bet­ter com­bi­na­tion of ef­fi­cient mar­kets and ef­fec­tive gov­ern­ments”.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts have said the de­ci­sion to in­volve the state and the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party heav­ily in all sec­tors of the econ­omy could be prob­lem­atic.</p>
    <p>The full de­tails of the 14th Five-Year Plan will be known only in March next year. The world will be watch­ing to see the choices that China will be mak­ing in its ef­forts to re­alise its eco­nomic goals. It will take longer to know if th­ese choices are the suit­able ones.</p>
