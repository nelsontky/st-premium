    <p>Jem, West­gate, Mustafa Cen­tre and the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) Build­ing are among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The other lo­ca­tions are BLS In­ter­na­tional in In­ter­na­tional Plaza, Jet­speed Travel, and McDon­ald’s out­lets in City Square and Hil­lion malls.</p>
    <p>H&M in Jem was vis­ited on two oc­ca­sions, while Uniqlo i n the same mall was vis­ited once.</p>
    <p>MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited to get peo­ple who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of l oca­tions and times can be found on Gov.sg</p>
    <p>MOH con­firmed nine new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,003.</p>
    <p>An asymp­to­matic 20-year-old per­ma­nent res­i­dent was the only com­mu­nity case. His in­fec­tion was de­tected when he took a pre-de­par­ture Covid-19 test on Tues­day prior to a planned trip to In­dia.</p>
    <p>There were seven i mported cases, com­pris­ing one per­ma­nent res­i­dent, one long-term visit pass holder, three work pass hold­ers, a work per­mit holder and a spe­cial pass holder.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent res­i­dent is a 57-year-old man who re­turned from Italy, while the long-term visit pass holder is a 22-year-old woman from Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>Of the three work pass hold­ers, two re­turned from Bel­gium and one from the United States.</p>
    <p>The work per­mit holder is a 33-year-old man who re­turned from Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial pass holder is a 37-year-old man who had trav­elled from the Philip­pines. All the im­ported cases were placed on stay­home no­tice (SHN) on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>They were tested while serv­ing their SHNs at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties even though all were asymp­to­matic. A mi­grant worker liv­ing in a dor­mi­tory was the re­main­ing case.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from two cases in the week be­fore to four in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also in­creased from one case to four over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 10 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,894 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered. A to­tal of 42 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 24 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
