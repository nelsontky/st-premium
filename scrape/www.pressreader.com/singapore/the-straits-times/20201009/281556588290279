    <p>Hun­dreds of peo­ple have been ar­rested in Jakarta as demon­stra­tors and po­lice clashed in the In­done­sian cap­i­tal yes­ter­day, on the third day of protests against a po­lar­is­ing new jobs law. In the past two days, 800 peo­ple have been de­tained in the cap­i­tal, Jakarta po­lice said.</p>

    <p>Po­lice and demon­stra­tors clashed in Jakarta yes­ter­day on the third day of protests and labour strikes against a po­lar­is­ing new jobs law passed in In­done­sia this week.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of demon­stra­tors gath­ered near the pres­i­den­tial palace in cen­tral Jakarta, shout­ing and throw­ing stones. Po­lice fired tear gas and wa­ter can­non in an at­tempt to dis­perse the crowd.</p>
    <p>Black smoke rose across the cap­i­tal yes­ter­day af­ter­noon as pro­test­ers burned pub­lic trans­port fa­cil­i­ties and dam­aged po­lice posts.</p>
    <p>The oper­a­tor of Jakarta’s MRT rail net­work said un­der­ground sta­tions had been closed.</p>
    <p>The “om­nibus” jobs cre­ation Bill, passed into law on Mon­day, has seen thou­sands of peo­ple across the coun­try take to the streets in protest against leg­is­la­tion they say un­der­mines labour rights and weak­ens en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We ask that the law be re­pealed im­me­di­ately,” said pro­tester Maulana Syarif , 45, who has worked at As­tra Honda Mo­tor for 25 years.</p>
    <p>“This is our strug­gle for our chil­dren and grand­chil­dren, and our fu­ture gen­er­a­tions... (With the new</p>
    <p>law), our well-be­ing will de­crease, and we will lack job cer­tainty.”</p>
    <p>In the past two days, 800 peo­ple have been de­tained in the cap­i­tal, Jakarta po­lice spokesman Yusri Yunus said. At least two stu­dent pro­test­ers were hos­pi­talised with head in­juries, and six of­fi­cers wounded.</p>
    <p>“I feel sorry for labour­ers work­ing day and night with­out suf­fi­cient wages or power,” said IT stu­dent Arawinda Kar­tika as she marched to­wards the palace.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, demon­stra­tions were un­der way in al­most a dozen cities. Tele­vi­sion chan­nels showed footage of the protests, in­clud­ing in re­mote ar­eas such as North Maluku.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo’s gov­ern­ment has cham­pi­oned the flag­ship leg­is­la­tion as key to boost­ing In­done­sia’s ail­ing econ­omy by stream­lin­ing reg­u­la­tions, cut­ting red tape and at­tract­ing more for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Bahlil La­hadalia, the head of In­done­sia’s In­vest­ment Co­or­di­nat­ing Board, ap­pealed to young peo­ple to trust the gov­ern­ment’s in­tent</p>
    <p>for the law, which is to cre­ate jobs.</p>
    <p>“Please be as­sured this law is to cre­ate jobs for the un­em­ployed In­done­sian peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko, who was on a work­ing visit to Cen­tral Kal­i­man­tan yes­ter­day, was ac­cused on so­cial me­dia of avoid­ing the protests.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens re­sponded to news of his visit us­ing the trending Twit­ter hash­tag #Jokowi Kabur, or “Jokowi runs away”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bey Mach­mudin, the sec­re­tariat’s deputy for pro­to­col, press and the me­dia, said the trip was planned long ago. “The pres­i­den­tial agenda for the food es­tate has been sched­uled in advance. So it has ab­so­lutely noth­ing to do with the demon­stra­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko was sched­uled to in­spect a food es­tate, ex­am­in­ing rice cul­ti­va­tion, fish cages and duck farms in Pandih Batu district, and to dis­trib­ute ini­tial work­ing cap­i­tal aid to small and medium en­ter­prises in the Pu­lang Pisau re­gency.</p>
