    <p>To en­cour­age vis­i­tors to Sin­ga­pore while pro­tect­ing the coun­try against Covid-19, new re­quire­ments for trav­ellers like strin­gent and re­peated test­ing pro­to­cols are be­ing planned in lieu of a two-week stay­home no­tice pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung also set out other steps that Sin­ga­pore will take to open up its bor­ders and re­vive air travel – from ne­go­ti­at­ing travel bub­bles to uni­lat­er­ally lift­ing bor­der re­stric­tions on safe coun­tries and re­gions to con­tin­ued pur­suit of re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>In a min­is­te­rial state­ment on avi­a­tion re­cov­ery in Par­lia­ment, Mr Ong said Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as an avi­a­tion hub and its su­pe­rior air con­nec­tiv­ity are es­sen­tial to the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent stay-home no­tice rule is a de­ter­rent to po­ten­tial trav­ellers, he ac­knowl­edged, but as­sured the House that the Gov­ern­ment is ex­plor­ing ways to fa­cil­i­tate their ar­rival while man­ag­ing the risk of virus in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant for trav­ellers from coun­tries that are eco­nom­i­cally im­por­tant to Sin­ga­pore but have higher in­fec­tion rates, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>It would also ben­e­fit peo­ple who need to come here for pur­poses like re­unit­ing with a long-sep­a­rated part­ner or on com­pas­sion­ate grounds.</p>
    <p>“The mes­sage we want to send to the world is this – Sin­ga­pore has started to re­open its bor­ders. In the near fu­ture, if you have the virus un­der con­trol and in­fec­tion rates are as low as Sin­ga­pore’s, you are wel­come to visit us, but trav­ellers will be sub­ject to a Covid-19 test as a pre­cau­tion,” said Mr Ong. “If you are from a place where in­fec­tion rates are higher than Sin­ga­pore’s, you can also visit us, so long as you agree to con­di­tions such as test­ing, seg­re­ga­tion and con­tact trac­ing.”</p>
    <p>These new re­quire­ments will work in tan­dem with up­com­ing ar­range­ments like air travel bub­bles with safe coun­tries and re­gions, where gen­eral trav­ellers need not stick to a con­trolled itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>The risks with these bub­bles can be fur­ther man­aged by set­ting a quota for the num­ber of trav­ellers a day, and en­sur­ing ev­ery­one gets tested for Covid-19, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers will have to ap­ply for air travel passes be­fore their jour­neys, to al­low Sin­ga­pore to plan for their ar­rival and re­duce the num­bers if the epi­demic sit­u­a­tion changes.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has an­nounced its in­ten­tion to es­tab­lish such bub­bles with sev­eral na­tions, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, Mr Ong noted. “We have re­sponded pos­i­tively. We hope to com­mence dis­cus­sions with Hong Kong and other part­ners soon.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will also con­tinue to pur­sue re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments, where trav­ellers are tested be­fore de­par­ture and on ar­rival to en­sure they do not carry the virus. They will also have con­trolled itin­er­ar­ies to min­imise the risk of com­mu­nity spread. So far, Sin­ga­pore has such ar­range­ments with Brunei, China, Ja­pan, Malaysia and South Korea, noted Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>It will con­tinue to fa­cil­i­tate trans­fers at Changi too. Tra­di­tion­ally, about a quar­ter of pas­sen­ger vol­umes at the air­port are trans­fers, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Since June, about 27,000 pas­sen­gers have trans­ferred safely through Sin­ga­pore, and there are now about 2,500 trans­fer pas­sen­gers weekly. Mr Ong said these num­bers are ex­pected to rise, adding: “We have put in place ro­bust safe­guards and no Sin­ga­porean has be­come ill as a re­sult of these trans­fers.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore should also be pre­pared to lift its bor­der re­stric­tions to coun­tries and re­gions that are deemed safe, he said. “Purely from an in­fec­tion risk point of view, the risk of a trav­eller from these places car­ry­ing the virus when they ar­rive at Changi Air­port is no higher than that of a Sin­ga­pore res­i­dent com­ing from Jurong or Sem­bawang.”</p>
    <p>But as a pre­cau­tion, these trav­ellers will be tested for Covid-19 .</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore uni­lat­er­ally opened its bor­ders to trav­ellers from Brunei and New Zealand last month, and more re­cently to those from Viet­nam and Aus­tralia – ex­clud­ing the state of Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>While he does not ex­pect to see large num­bers of trav­ellers from those coun­tries in the short term, Mr Ong said such uni­lat­eral open­ings are still mean­ing­ful be­cause they act as a stand­ing in­vi­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>He cited Bri­tain, which cur­rently al­lows Sin­ga­pore­ans to travel there uni­lat­er­ally with­out quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>As Bri­tain’s rate of Covid-19 in­fec­tion re­mains quite high, the Re­pub­lic still ad­vises against Sin­ga­pore­ans go­ing there, and is also not ready to al­low trav­ellers from there to come here freely, he noted. “But we ap­pre­ci­ate the UK’s stand­ing in­vi­ta­tion. So once their in­fec­tion rate falls and be­comes com­pa­ra­ble to ours, we will lift re­stric­tions quickly, which will ef­fec­tively re­store travel be­tween our coun­tries,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>In out­lin­ing these plans, he noted that bor­ders are still closed in most parts of the world.</p>
    <p>“For Mem­bers who are hop­ing to hear an­nounce­ments on some air travel re­sump­tion and even pos­si­ble De­cem­ber hol­i­day des­ti­na­tions, I am sorry I will dis­ap­point you,” he said.</p>
