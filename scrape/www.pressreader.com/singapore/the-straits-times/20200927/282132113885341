    <p>PARIS • Rafael Nadal may have won the French Open a record 12 times, but the Spa­niard feels this year’s con­di­tions will be the most dif­fi­cult he has ever faced at Roland Gar­ros and he must be at his best to have a chance of re­tain­ing his ti­tle again.</p>
    <p>The clay-court Grand Slam, which starts to­day, is usu­ally held from May to June but was pushed back due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The weather is much cooler at this time of the year and the tem­per­a­tures have fur­ther dipped due to rain in Paris.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers are also us­ing a dif­fer­ent ball, mak­ing the con­di­tions more un­fa­mil­iar for the Span­ish world No. 2.</p>
    <p>“What you need is the right en­ergy to ac­cept ev­ery sin­gle thing. That’s what I’m do­ing,” said Nadal, who prefers warmer con­di­tions and faster clay courts.</p>
    <p>“Just stay pos­i­tive know­ing that the con­di­tions are not per­fect for me, maybe not per­fect for oth­ers ei­ther, and ac­cept I am go­ing to need my best ver­sion to have chances.”</p>
    <p>Nadal, who is one Grand Slam be­hind Roger Fed­erer’s record men’s haul of 20 ti­tles, skipped the US Open due to the pan­demic and then lost in the quar­ter-fi­nals of the ATP Masters in Rome last week to Ar­gen­tinian Diego Schwartz­man.</p>
    <p>The Rome event was Nadal’s first af­ter the lengthy shut­down and world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic said that it showed his great ri­val was not un­beat­able on clay courts.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, 100 per cent true. I al­ways have been beat­able on clay. He beat me a lot of times,” Nadal ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>“Con­di­tions here prob­a­bly are the most dif­fi­cult for me ever in Roland Gar­ros for so many dif­fer­ent fac­tors. Ball com­pletely dif­fer­ent. I think it’s not the right ball to play on a clay court. Ball is super slow, heavy. Slow con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“Prepa­ra­tions have been less than usual. But I’m here to fight, to play with the high­est in­ten­sity pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>He will be­gin his cam­paign against Egor Gerasi­mov, the 83rdranked Be­laru­sian.</p>
    <p>But he will not ben­e­fit from the warm air and slip­pery, bouncy sur­face that usu­ally makes his spinny shots all but im­pos­si­ble to handle.</p>
    <p>“The weather is so cold,” added the sec­ond seed, who was quick to no­tice that his prac­tice ses­sion on Friday was when the tem­per­a­ture was at a 9 deg C with even a brief del­uge of hail­stones.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old is seeded to face Djokovic, the cham­pion in Rome, in the fi­nal. The Serb and the re­tired Robin Soder­ling are the only two men to have beaten the “King of Clay” in Paris in 15 years.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Nadal still holds a 6-1 ad­van­tage over the 2016 cham­pion, and 17-time Ma­jor win­ner, at Roland Gar­ros. His win-loss record stands at 93-2 and he has earned US$22 mil­lion (S$30.3 mil­lion) at the French Open alone.</p>
    <p>Sta­tis­tics aside, for­mer cham­pion Mats Wi­lan­der be­lieves that Djokovic is the favourite to claim a sec­ond French Open crown.</p>
    <p>“Some­one like Rafa will go to bed ev­ery night in Paris think­ing please be 30 de­grees, blue skies and even windy to­mor­row. Now he’ll wake up and it’s 12 de­grees and he has to play some­one who hits the ball heavy,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I can’t imag­ine any­one be­ing more pre­pared for a slow­ish clay court than No­vak. This is a mas­sive op­por­tu­nity for him.”</p>
    <p>Nadal is also on course to play newly crowned US Open cham­pion Do­minic Thiem in the semi-fi­nals, the Aus­trian he beat to win the ti­tle in 2018 and 2019.</p>
    <p>Fu­elled with self-be­lief af­ter his break­through, Thiem will be­lieve he can win the ti­tle on his best sur­face.</p>
    <p>IM­PER­FECT CON­DI­TIONS</p>
    <p>Just stay pos­i­tive know­ing that the con­di­tions are not per­fect for me, maybe not per­fect for oth­ers ei­ther, and ac­cept I am go­ing to need my best ver­sion to have chances.</p>
