    <p>DOHA • Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino on Wed­nes­day praised Qatar for push­ing ahead with 2022 World Cup prepa­ra­tions de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, while the rest of the world “stood still”.</p>
    <p>On a visit to Doha, dur­ing which he got into a foot­ball kit to play a seven-a-side-match at the strik­ing 60,000-ca­pac­ity Al Bayt sta­dium de­signed to re­sem­ble a tra­di­tional Arab tent, the 50-year-old said he was “very pleased” with Qatar’s progress ahead of the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“Al Bayt Sta­dium is in­cred­i­ble: a true foot­ball sta­dium,” In­fantino said in a Fifa state­ment.</p>
    <p>“It has a real foot­ball feel and a lo­cal touch. The tented shape makes it truly unique, and the Ara­bic pat­terns in the roof are just beau­ti­ful. I am speech­less.</p>
    <p>“We have seen the plans, but when you see the re­al­ity, it is even more im­pres­sive,” he also said in the state­ment, which added that all eight venues will be com­pleted “well in advance” of the event.</p>
    <p>“Qatar has been able to con­tinue to advance dur­ing the last six months while the world stood still – from in­fras­truc­ture prepa­ra­tions to im­por­tant de­vel­op­ments such as the re­cent labour re­forms.”</p>
    <p>Qatar has made a se­ries of re­forms to its em­ploy­ment reg­u­la­tions since be­ing se­lected to host the World Cup, which has re­quired a vast pro­gramme of con­struc­tion de­pen­dent on for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>One change to its labour laws saw the rais­ing of the min­i­mum wage by 25 per cent to 1,000 riyals (S$373) a month. How­ever, rights cam­paign­ers say that wide­spread abuses per­sist.</p>
    <p>The Gulf state will kick off the tour­na­ment at the Al Bayt Sta­dium, which takes its shape from the tra­di­tional tents used by no­madic peo­ple in the Gulf re­gion.</p>
    <p>The tim­ing of the com­pe­ti­tion, due to be held in Novem­ber and De­cem­ber next year, re­mains un­changed.</p>
    <p>Work con­tin­ued at 2022 sites this year but was slowed to al­low virus con­tain­ment mea­sures to be ob­served.</p>
