    <p>TOKYO • The Tokyo Olympics may have to be post­poned again if the coro­n­avirus mu­tates into a stronger pathogen, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a prom­i­nent Ja­panese gov­ern­ment ad­viser, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a re­cent spike in cases in the Ja­panese cap­i­tal is due to a fail­ure to stick to guide­lines to pre­vent con­ta­gion, he added.</p>
    <p>A physi­cian who served as a science ad­viser to the Ja­panese cab­i­net from 2006-2008, Dr Kurokawa also headed an in­de­pen­dent probe into the 2011 Fukushima nu­clear dis­as­ter. Cur­rently, he is ad­vis­ing the gov­ern­ment on the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I think the virus is mu­tat­ing all the time... it may be a much stronger virus that trig­gers a sec­ond wave,” he said. “The Olympics may be post­poned again, but I can’t pre­dict.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s small in­ci­dents hap­pen­ing in Tokyo... new cases are be­cause peo­ple are not abid­ing by rec­om­men­da­tions. But if there are some mu­ta­tions, that is a com­pletely dif­fer­ent story.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike told Reuters on Mon­day the Olympics, orig­i­nally sched­uled to start this month but put off to next year be­cause of the pan­demic, must go ahead as a sym­bol of world unity in over­com­ing the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The spike in in­fec­tions in Tokyo, which ac­counts for more than onethird of Ja­pan’s more than 23,000 cases, has prompted a back­lash against a planned cam­paign to pro­mote do­mes­tic tourism.</p>
    <p>Dr Kurokawa said author­i­ties were try­ing to bal­ance pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“I think one of the con­cerns of this pan­demic is how to pre­vent the spread­ing out of this corona in­fec­tion. The other side of this is­sue is... how to pro­mote the econ­omy. Many peo­ple are los­ing their jobs,” he said, adding that he thought the gov­ern­ment was “care­fully bal­anc­ing” the two pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Kurokawa also said that what­ever ex­perts rec­om­mended based on science, po­lit­i­cal lead­ers had to make the fi­nal pol­icy call.</p>
    <p>“The sci­en­tific com­mu­nity’s rec­om­men­da­tions have to be fact­based, science-based rec­om­men­da­tions, but politi­cians have to make the de­ci­sions,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Sci­en­tists give ad­vice, but de­ci­sion-mak­ing is not by sci­en­tists.”</p>
