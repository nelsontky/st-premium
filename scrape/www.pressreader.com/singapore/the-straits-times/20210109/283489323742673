    <p>Em­bark­ing on a new job at the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) be­fore the Covid-19 out­break was not what lo­cal schol­ar­ship holder Daniel Ong saw com­ing.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old LTA Schol­ar­ship holder de­scribes that it felt like be­ing thrown into the deep end when he took on the role of a project engi­neer in the fare sys­tems di­vi­sion, as part of his first ro­ta­tion un­der the schol­ar­ship pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Just when I was learn­ing the ropes from the se­niors, many things started to change as a re­sult of Covid-19... we were forced to adapt and cope,” he re­calls of his early days in his new role.</p>
    <p>He also saw first-hand how a big or­gan­i­sa­tion like LTA un­der­went “quick, large-scale change”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, who grad­u­ated in 2020 with bach­e­lor’s de­grees in me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing and busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion, says the “steep learn­ing curve” taught him the value of adapt­abil­ity. He adds: “The pan­demic re­ally drives home the im­por­tance of keep­ing a nim­ble mind­set.”</p>
    <p>“As part of the project team, we sup­port our tech­ni­cal coun­ter­parts whose work is re­lated to com­puter en­gi­neer­ing. There is a need to be fa­mil­iar with their job scope in ar­eas such as soft­ware, sys­tem ar­chi­tec­ture, se­cu­rity and ma­chine hard­ware. It’s a lot to keep up with for a new engi­neer on the team, and I’m thank­ful for my col­leagues who are al­ways will­ing to an­swer my ques­tions,” he says.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing new to the job, Mr Ong says he is given ad hoc as­sign­ments, which pro­vide him with plenty of ex­pe­ri­ence. And as a schol­ar­ship holder, he has the op­por­tu­nity to reg­u­larly en­gage with the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s se­nior man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The LTA lo­cal un­der­grad­u­ate schol­ar­ship cov­ers tuition and com­pul­sory fees, main­te­nance al­lowance, hos­tel fees for lo­cals, and the spon­sor­ship of one ap­proved stu­dent ex­change pro­gramme or sum­mer school.</p>
    <p>At work, Mr Ong’s main role is over­see­ing projects to com­ple­tion, and he also has op­por­tu­ni­ties to be in­volved in new do­mains. “I was in­volved in an ex­plo­ration project on ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) and had a chance to un­der­stand how AI de­vel­ops spe­cific do­main knowl­edge.”</p>
    <p>An­other project that Mr Ong worked on ex­posed him to a range of wire­less tech­nolo­gies such as ra­dio fre­quency iden­ti­fi­ca­tion and Blue­tooth, to con­sider the pos­si­bil­ity of in­cor­po­rat­ing such tech­nol­ogy into Sin­ga­pore’s tran­sit land­scape.</p>
    <p>He also en­joys the cross-train­ing that the schol­ar­ship pro­gramme pro­vides, where project and ex­ec­u­tive teams in­ter­act and work with one an­other.</p>
    <p>“I’m ac­tu­ally quite ex­cited to join the ex­ec­u­tive teams and get my hands dirty. I feel it’s the fastest way to learn... (and) al­lows me to bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate the chal­lenges and com­plex­i­ties on the ground, and the con­sid­er­a­tions when de­sign­ing sys­tems for op­er­a­tion and main­te­nance.”</p>
    <p>This year, Mr Ong hopes to im­prove and stream­line cer­tain “repet­i­tive and te­dious” pro­cesses in his depart­ment.</p>
    <p>He says: “I am now able to bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate the work that LTA is do­ing for Sin­ga­pore. By adapt­ing ad­vance­ments in tech­nol­ogy into our work, LTA is the driver of land trans­port in Sin­ga­pore for the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>In such a tech­nol­ogy-driven fu­ture, he imag­ines de­vel­op­ments such as “AI-pow­ered ser­vice kiosks, which could be one-stop points for com­mut­ing needs”.</p>
    <p>And in the light of a post-pan­demic fu­ture, he adds: “These kiosks could be voice-ac­ti­vated, thus min­imis­ing con­tact, eas­ing screen nav­i­ga­tion and en­hanc­ing com­muters’ ex­pe­ri­ence. One day, com­muters may not even need to take their cards out to tap on fare read­ers with hands-free tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>I am now able to bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate the work that LTA is do­ing for Sin­ga­pore. By adapt­ing ad­vance­ments in tech­nol­ogy into our work, LTA is the driver of land trans­port in Sin­ga­pore for the fu­ture.</p>
