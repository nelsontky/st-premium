    <p>Usu­ally a bumper ses­sion on Wall Street overnight would fire up lo­cal in­vestors, but a re­gion-wide wari­ness ahead of the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate in the United States kept the mood sub­dued yesterday.</p>
    <p>The safety-first ap­proach helped send the Straits Times In­dex (STI) down 11.4 points, or 0.46 per cent, to 2,471.61 on trade of 1.22 bil­lion shares worth $1.06 bil­lion, with losers out­num­ber­ing gain­ers 244 to 178.</p>
    <p>The falls mir­rored those across the re­gion and came de­spite the Dow ad­vanc­ing 1.5 per cent and the Nas­daq soar­ing 1.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Jef­frey Hal­ley, a se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst at Oanda, said Asian stock mar­kets are “fail­ing to share Wall Street’s ex­u­ber­ance, with one eye on (Tues­day night’s) first US pres­i­den­tial de­bate”.</p>
    <p>IG Sin­ga­pore mar­ket strate­gist Pan Jingyi added that moves in Asian mar­kets are ex­pected to be sub­dued with the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion ahead.</p>
    <p>The STI’s top loser was re­tail firm Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional, which lost 3.8 per cent to US$3.76.</p>
    <p>At one point, it was down more than 4 per cent, which was more than any full-day loss it has ever in­curred since April 21, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg data. It also came in spite of RHB Re­search and HSBC both rais­ing their calls on the stock to “buy” last week.</p>
    <p>The top per­former was Kep­pel Corp, which rose 2.6 per cent to $4.30. The firm an­nounced after the mar­ket closed that it is re­view­ing its off­shore and ma­rine (O&M) busi­ness and in­tends to un­lock $3 bil­lion to $5 bil­lion in value of its as­sets over the next three years.</p>
    <p>The most ac­tive counter of the day was Sem­b­corp Ma­rine. It added just 0.7 per cent to 14.4 cents but on a vol­ume of close to 70 mil­lion shares traded, likely on re­newed mar­ket chat­ter about a po­ten­tial merger with Kep­pel’s O&M divi­sion that looks in­creas­ingly likely to come to pass.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets fin­ished mixed. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 0.85 per cent and Malaysia’s KLCI fell 0.51 per cent, but the Shang­hai Com­pos­ite added 0.21 per cent.</p>
    <p>Other win­ners were Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225, ahead 0.12 per cent, and the Kospi in Seoul, which added 0.86 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Trad­ing was thin ahead of the Chuseok hol­i­day... There are im­por­tant events such as the US pres­i­den­tial de­bate, South Korea’s Septem­ber trade data and global PMIs (pur­chas­ing man­agers’ in­dexes) dur­ing the hol­i­day sea­son,” said Daishin Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Lee Ky­oung-min.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s S&P/ASX 200 in­dex ended flat as in­vestors closed po­si­tions at the end of the month, while un­cer­tain­ties sur­round­ing the US elec­tions kept mar­ket sen­ti­ment in check.</p>
