    <p>The pan­demic is chang­ing how shop­ping malls are built, in per­haps the most dis­rup­tive re­tail environmen­t in mod­ern times.</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ers have re­placed the va­cant big units with a mix of re­tail, din­ing, en­ter­tain­ment, fit­ness, cowork­ing and health­care op­tions. They have also added apart­ments, ho­tels and of­fices to the prop­er­ties – of­ten to make bet­ter use of va­cant park­ing lots and cre­ate built-in traf­fic gen­er­a­tors – and they are be­gin­ning to cre­ate dis­tri­bu­tion and self­s­tor­age hubs at malls as more peo­ple pur­chase their goods online.</p>
    <p>In June, Washington Prime Group agreed to turn a former Sears lo­ca­tion at its Mor­gan­town Mall into a lo­gis­tics, dis­tri­bu­tion and ful­fil­ment cen­tre for a health­care net­work serv­ing West Vir­ginia Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>“As more depart­ment stores be­come va­cant, we do need to re-en­vi­sion the fu­ture of mall prop­er­ties,” said Mr Greg Maloney, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Amer­i­cas re­tail unit of Jones Lang LaSalle.</p>
    <p>“Will it be 100 per cent re­tail? No, but its suc­cess still comes down to lo­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Long be­fore the coro­n­avirus ar­rived in the US, many malls, of­ten over­bur­dened with debt and strug­gling with va­cancy and de­clin­ing val­ues, were fight­ing to stay alive.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of malls has de­clined to fewer than 1,000 today from 3,000 at the turn of the cen­tury, ac­cord­ing to Mr Nick Ege­la­nian, pres­i­dent of SiteWorks, a shop­ping cen­tre and re­tail con­sul­tant. And, he pre­dicts, only about 200 of the strong­est malls with the best lo­ca­tions will be left by the end of the decade, if not sooner.</p>
    <p>“The true mall of the fu­ture will in­cor­po­rate a mix of uses,” he said, “and the re­tail will be down­sized: If it has 2 mil­lion sq ft today, it may only need 1 mil­lion sq ft to­mor­row. But it’s go­ing to be painful get­ting there, and the ones that sur­vive are go­ing to need a lot of cap­i­tal.”</p>
    <p>The ideal mall, he said, is one that is sur­rounded by of­fices, high-rise res­i­dences and ho­tels.</p>
    <p>Some malls will em­pha­sise lux­ury and cater to the af­flu­ent, ob­servers add, while oth­ers will fo­cus on mid­dle-mar­ket con­sumers with stores that sell bud­get prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>This off-price strat­egy is one that malls of higher qual­ity pre­vi­ously avoided, said Mr Vince Ti­bone, a se­nior an­a­lyst cov­er­ing re­tail for Green Street Ad­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>“In the minds of the own­ers of top malls, there was a higher and bet­ter use for their prop­er­ties,” he said. “But there are a lot fewer op­tions to back­fill space today, and even those malls are look­ing to just get ten­ants into va­can­cies.”</p>
    <p>To bet­ter po­si­tion it­self for the fu­ture, one mid­dle-mar­ket mall owner, Penn­syl­va­nia Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust, has sold 18 malls with sig­nif­i­cant depart­ment store ex­po­sure over the past five years and is rein­vest­ing more than US$885 mil­lion (S$1.21 bil­lion) in pro­ceeds into its core as­sets.</p>
    <p>Among other projects, the real es­tate trust sank US$210 mil­lion into the Fash­ion Dis­trict, a 1.5 mil­lion sq ft mall in down­town Philadel­phia that it owns with Mac­erich. A num­ber of new ten­ants joined the ros­ter when it re­opened last year, in­clud­ing an AMC The­atres cine­plex and flex­i­ble-of­fice provider In­dus­tri­ous.</p>
    <p>Other non-re­tail com­pa­nies con­tinue to show in­ter­est in the com­pany’s prop­er­ties, said Mr Joseph Co­radino, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Penn­syl­va­nia Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust, which is based in Philadel­phia and owns 21 malls pri­mar­ily on the East Coast.</p>
    <p>“When you step back and look at malls, they typ­i­cally have phe­nom­e­nal lo­ca­tions at ma­jor in­ter­sec­tions and high­ways,” he said. “Cer­tainly, the mall busi­ness today is dif­fer­ent than it was a year ago or even six months ago. But I don’t think the suc­cess of malls is a ques­tion of apoca­lypse or death. I think it’s re­ally an evo­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Yet, like many malls that have been repo­si­tioned i n t he past decade, Fash­ion Dis­trict boasts a high per­cent­age of food and en­ter­tain­ment ten­ants. Plagued by ques­tions over how soon con­sumers will feel safe re­turn­ing to them, these busi­nesses are op­er­at­ing at par­tial ca­pac­ity na­tion­wide, and some are clos­ing.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers an­tic­i­pate that en­ter­tain­ment and restau­rants will con­tinue to gen­er­ate traf­fic over the long term, although they ac­knowl­edge that full re­cov­ery depends on a coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Still, restau­rants and en­ter­tain­ment have be­come so ubiq­ui­tous that they have failed to live up to the ex­pec­ta­tions of many mall own­ers, said Mr Scott Stu­art, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Turn­around Man­age­ment As­so­ci­a­tion, an or­gan­i­sa­tion in Chicago that rep­re­sents re­struc­tur­ing pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>“While the uses have filled gaps in malls, they’re be­gin­ning to look like short-term so­lu­tions,” he said. “Con­sumers have a choice to go to a mall or some other set­ting to ex­pe­ri­ence them.”</p>
    <p>Some own­ers, how­ever, will be forced to recog­nise that their lo­ca­tions no longer fit in the re­tail world, Mr Ege­la­nian said. But that may pro­duce op­por­tu­ni­ties to start new in­dus­trial, hous­ing, of­fice or mixed-use de­vel­op­ments from scratch.</p>
    <p>“There may not be any time in the last 100 years when so many 100-acre (40.5ha) sites lo­cated at that per­fect in­ter­sec­tion have been avail­able for re­de­vel­op­ment within such a short pe­riod of time,” he sug­gested. “They will have value for many uses and could be big eco­nomic gen­er­a­tors for their com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
