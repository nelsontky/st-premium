    <p>LON­DON • For­mer Mercedes team boss Ross Brawn has hailed Lewis Hamil­ton’s Bri­tish Grand Prix win – which came on three wheels and a flat tyre – as “ab­so­lutely mind­blow­ing”.</p>
    <p>The six-time world cham­pion’s front left tyre de­flated on the last lap while l ead­ing last Sun­day’s race, leav­ing the cham­pi­onship leader 3.8km from the fin­ish with Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen chas­ing af­ter pit­ting for fresh soft tyres.</p>
    <p>But data pro­vided by Mercedes showed Hamil­ton com­pleted the fi­nal lap 22 sec­onds slower than his penul­ti­mate one. He went through the high-speed Copse and Stowe cor­ners at 141kmh and 133kmh re­spec­tively and reached 230kmh on the Han­gar Straight.</p>
    <p>“He reached 230kmh on the straight with only three wheels, and a front left tyre flail­ing around – ab­so­lutely mind blow­ing,” said Brawn, For­mula One’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for mo­tor sport.</p>
    <p>“He judged it to per­fec­tion to win the race by a few sec­onds and a bril­liant ex­am­ple of the amaz­ing tal­ents and brav­ery of Lewis.”</p>
    <p>Pirelli are con­duct­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into what hap­pened, with Hamil­ton’s team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas and McLaren’s Car­los Sainz also suf­fer­ing late fail­ures.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s dom­i­nance – he has won the past three grands prix – has made him the odds-on favourite to equal and even­tu­ally pass Michael Schu­macher’s record of seven ti­tles. The 35-year-old Bri­ton is also four vic­to­ries short of the Ger­man’s all­time record of 91 race wins.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton can equal that at the Ital­ian Grand Prix at Monza in Septem­ber and sur­pass it a week later at Fer­rari-owned Mugello – where the Ital­ian team will mark their 1,000th grand prix.</p>
    <p>If that hap­pens, Jean Todt, who presided over Schu­macher’s golden years at Fer­rari, is pre­pared to con­grat­u­late Hamil­ton.</p>
    <p>“If you have a link to the records, you’d like the records to stay,” for­mer team boss Todt, now pres­i­dent of the gov­ern­ing In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion (FIA), said.</p>
    <p>“On the other side, nor­mally, a record has a du­ra­tion in life. All the records are due to be bro­ken.”</p>
