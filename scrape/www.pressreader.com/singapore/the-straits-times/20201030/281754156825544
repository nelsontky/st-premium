    <p>A new Covid-19 test­ing l ab at Changi Air­port is slated to open in the first quar­ter of next year, and it will use a test kit that can shorten the time needed for re­sults from 2.5 hours to 1.5 hours.</p>
    <p>The wait may be even shorter for trav­ellers from coun­tries deemed to have lower risks of Covid-19 in­fec­tion, as the au­thor­i­ties study the fea­si­b­lity of in­tro­duc­ing less sen­si­tive but quicker tests, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port can cur­rently test up to 10,000 sam­ples a day by tap­ping ex­ter­nal labs, and can dou­ble this ca­pac­ity if re­quired.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said speed­ing up the Covid-19 test­ing process was a key con­sid­er­a­tion for set­ting up the new lab. “You don’t have to trans­port the sam­ples from Changi to the lab, which saves a lot of time,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery minute counts in terms of air­port op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>The fa­cil­ity will use the Res­o­lute 2.0 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test kit that was jointly de­vel­oped by DSO Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries and the Agency for Science, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search.</p>
    <p>PCR test kits are the gold stan­dard in terms of ac­cu­racy for Covid-19 tests, but they are more costly and take slightly longer to process than other op­tions such as anti­gen rapid tests or breathal­yser tests.</p>
    <p>On whether other op­tions could be used to test trav­ellers, Mr Ong said: “As long as it is high enough in terms of sen­si­tiv­ity, it works.</p>
    <p>“At some point, for safer coun­tries, it could be (test­ing by) breathal­yser... It is al­ready very un­likely that trav­ellers (from these coun­tries are in­fected), so this is just an added pre­cau­tion.”</p>
    <p>But he also ac­knowl­edged that a breathal­yser test was not as ac­cu­rate as PCR tests, for ex­am­ple, and would thus not be ap­pli­ca­ble for use with all trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Asked if the Gov­ern­ment will look into sub­si­dis­ing the cost of Covid-19 test­ing for trav­ellers to help re­vive pas­sen­ger traf­fic, Mr Ong said: “Avi­a­tion has al­ways been a com­mer­cial op­er­a­tion... For some­one who chooses to travel, I think it is fair to pay for the test.”</p>
    <p>10,000</p>
    <p>Num­ber of sam­ples a day that Changi Air­port can cur­rently test by tap­ping ex­ter­nal labs. It can dou­ble this ca­pac­ity if re­quired.</p>
