    <p>Civil ser­vants and public healthcare work­ers have been given greater flex­i­bil­ity this year to clear their un­used an­nual leave due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In an un­precen­dented, one-off move, they will get a longer pe­riod to clear their un­taken leave and the op­tion to en­cash part of it.</p>
    <p>The new move al­lows some 85,000 civil ser­vants to carry for­ward half of 2019’s an­nual leave into 2021, if they have not used it by the end of 2020, said the Public Ser­vice Divi­sion (PSD) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, civil ser­vants are not al­lowed to bring for­ward 2019’s an­nual leave into 2021. They can only carry it over to 2020 and the un­used leave will be for­feited.</p>
    <p>If they still have re­main­ing leave after car­ry­ing for­ward half of 2019’s leave into 2021, they can cash it in un­der the new pol­icy. En­cash­ing in this way was not al­lowed pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Civil ser­vants get up to 18 days of an­nual leave, while those who have worked in the civil ser­vice for more than 10 years have 21 days.</p>
    <p>The PSD said: “This is a one-off mea­sure to recog­nise the ef­forts of our of­fi­cers in fight­ing the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, and as a re­sult are un­able to con­sume their ac­cu­mu­lated va­ca­tion leave.”</p>
    <p>The divi­sion added that statu­tory boards are “strongly en­cour­aged” to adopt sim­i­lar mea­sures for their of­fi­cers too.</p>
    <p>Over in the public healthcare sec­tor, The Busi­ness Times re­ported on Tues­day that roughly 60,000</p>
    <p>public healthcare work­ers can en­cash or carry for­ward any un­used leave from 2019 into 2021.</p>
    <p>Up to a third of their out­stand­ing leave from 2020 can be en­cashed, or brought over to 2021 in full.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health, which worked with public healthcare in­sti­tu­tions on the pol­icy, said public healthcare work­ers may not be able to fully utilise their an­nual leave en­ti­tle­ments this year as they have been work­ing tire­lessly on the front lines.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment’s new one-off leave pol­icy, how­ever, may not be as ap­pli­ca­ble to the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Linda Teo, coun­try man­ager of Man­pow­erGroup Sin­ga­pore: “Be­sides con­tain­ing cost dur­ing ear­lier stages of the pan­demic, this also en­sures the pri­vate sec­tor em­ploy­ers have enough man­power when the economy picks up.</p>
    <p>“More­over, un­like healthcare pro­fes­sion­als, pri­vate sec­tor work­ers are less re­stricted for travel over­seas and would have more op­por­tu­ni­ties to utilise their leave once more travel bub­bles are es­tab­lished.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kurt Wee, pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Small and Medium En­ter­prises, also said the public ser­vice pol­icy can­not be broadly ap­plied to the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Un­like those in es­sen­tial ser­vices, op­er­a­tions for many pri­vate sec­tor com­pa­nies were dis­rupted dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and they</p>
    <p>ex­pe­ri­enced a de­crease in de­mand for their prod­ucts dur­ing this pe­riod. Some of them con­tinue to face fi­nan­cial strains and may not be in the best po­si­tion to give em­ploy­ees the broad flex­i­bil­ity in their leave,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the stan­dard prac­tice for an­nual leave in the pri­vate sec­tor is the same as in the public sec­tor, which al­lows staff to carry it over par­tially to the next year.</p>
