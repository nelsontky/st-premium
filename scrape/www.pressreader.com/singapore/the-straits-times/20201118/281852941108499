    <p>BEI­JING • The Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day praised a Bri­tish diplo­mat who was filmed jump­ing into a river in south­ern China to save a drown­ing stu­dent, a rare warm mo­ment be­tween two coun­tries at log­ger­heads over hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s mis­sion in the south­west­ern city of Chongqing said on Mon­day that Con­sul Gen­eral Stephen El­li­son leapt into ac­tion at the week­end to save a woman who had fallen into a river cours­ing through a nearby tourist town.</p>
    <p>The video on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia – viewed more than 170 mil­lion times in China – shows Mr El­li­son pulling off his shoes and jump­ing in to res­cue the woman, who was float­ing face down.</p>
    <p>“I think he should be com­mended for his act of brav­ery. I’d like to give him a big, big thumbs up,” said for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian at a rou­tine brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr El­li­son’s ac­tions also earned praise from Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab, who tweeted: “His brav­ery and com­mit­ment demon­strate the very best of Bri­tish di­plo­mats around the world.”</p>
    <p>The 61-year-old for­mer en­gi­neer had only re­cently been ap­pointed to the role in the south­ern me­trop­o­lis af­ter serv­ing for years at the main em­bassy in Bei­jing, and is an ac­com­plished triath­lete, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>One user on Weibo, a Chi­nese so­cial me­dia plat­form sim­i­lar to Twit­ter, called Mr El­li­son an “English gen­tle­man”. Another called him the “Chi­nese peo­ple’s friend”.</p>
    <p>But while praise for Mr El­li­son has poured in, other com­ments on so­cial me­dia fo­cused on the fact that no lo­cals had jumped in to res­cue the woman and that they had done lit­tle to help as she strug­gled in the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“So many peo­ple did not jump in to save the girl, but waited for a for­eigner to save her?” one per­son wrote.</p>
    <p>I think he should be com­mended for his act of brav­ery. I’d like to give him a big, big thumbs up.</p>
