    <p>To help read­ers nav­i­gate the big changes hap­pen­ing both glob­ally and lo­cally, The Straits Times is hold­ing a se­ries of we­bi­nars ti­tled the ST Re­set 2021 in the weeks ahead to put the news into con­text.</p>
    <p>Cov­er­ing a range of press­ing is­sues such as deal­ing with the post­pan­demic job mar­ket, cy­ber se­cu­rity and health, the se­ries seeks to take stock of de­vel­op­ments and look ahead into 2021 as part of the re­vamped ST’s push to create in­creas­ingly en­gag­ing con­tent for read­ers.</p>
    <p>Said ST ed­i­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez: “This has been a be­wil­der­ing and chal­leng­ing year for all of us, and many are look­ing ahead to see where things might be head­ing. Our Re­set 2021 se­ries will help our read­ers think about the fu­ture, and what might lie ahead.”</p>
    <p>Kick­ing off next Thurs­day from 12.30pm to 2pm with a dis­cus­sion on what the newly elected Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will mean for Asia, the se­ries will fea­ture ST’s jour­nal­ists and ed­i­tors mod­er­at­ing dis­cus­sions with in­dus­try and sub­ject ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nars are free for all ST read­ers.</p>
    <p>The first we­bi­nar, “Geopo­lit­i­cal Re­set 2021”, will be mod­er­ated by as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Vikram Khanna, and fea­ture vet­eran diplo­mats Tommy Koh and Chan Heng Chee. Both guests are for­mer am­bas­sadors to the United States who also had ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing with US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den dur­ing their diplo­matic ca­reers.</p>
    <p>The ses­sion will ex­plore the likely for­eign pol­icy pri­or­i­ties of a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion, and how it will man­age the United States’ re­la­tion­ships with China, Asean and the rest of Asia.</p>
    <p>It will also look at the in­com­ing a d mi n i s t r a t i o n ’ s likely ap­proaches to trade poli­cies and cli­mate change and how th­ese will dif­fer from those of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times’ United States bureau chief Nir­mal Ghosh and global af­fairs correspond­ent Ben­jamin Kang Lim will also par­tic­i­pate in the panel dis­cus­sion.</p>

    <p>Read­ers will be able to sub­mit ques­tions at the event site be­fore the we­bi­nars which speak­ers will se­lect to ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond we­bi­nar on help­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans live longer and health­ier lives will be mod­er­ated by se­nior health correspond­ent Salma Kha­lik. She will be joined by Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan, who was the di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices dur­ing the Sars out­break, Pru­den­tial chief ex­ec­u­tive Den­nis Tan and Health Pro­mo­tion Board chief ex­ec­u­tive Zee Yoong Kang.</p>
    <p>“Keep­ing Sin­ga­pore Healthy” on Nov 25 will be pre­sented by in­sur­ance provider Pru­den­tial.</p>
    <p>A dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and cy­ber se­cu­rity we­bi­nar on Dec 9 mod­er­ated to by ST’s tech­nol­ogy ed­i­tor Irene Tham will ex­plore how peo­ple can keep them­selves safe on­line de­spite their in­creas­ing re­liance on dig­i­tal tools.</p>
    <p>“Job Losses and Op­por­tu­ni­ties in 2021” will fea­ture labour chief Ng Chee Meng and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap, and will be mod­er­ated by as­sis­tant news ed­i­tor Toh Yong Chuan.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Fer­nan­dez, who is also ed­i­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group: “This se­ries is meant to help us con­nect with and en­gage our au­di­ence, draw­ing them into the con­ver­sa­tion with newsmakers and those who shape the news.</p>
    <p>“We will start with th­ese ses­sions, and lis­ten to our read­ers to see what other top­ics they would like us to pur­sue in the new year.”</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING AHEAD</p>
    <p>This has been a be­wil­der­ing and chal­leng­ing year for all of us, and many are look­ing ahead to see where things might be head­ing. Our Re­set 2021 se­ries will help our read­ers think about the fu­ture, and what might lie ahead.</p>
    <p>MR WAR­REN FER­NAN­DEZ, ed­i­tor of The Straits Times, on the ST Re­set 2021 we­bi­nar se­ries which aims to help read­ers put the news into con­text.</p>
