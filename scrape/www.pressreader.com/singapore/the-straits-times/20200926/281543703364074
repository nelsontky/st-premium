    <p>The Toy­ota Corolla Altis Hy­brid is essen­tially a more ac­ces­si­ble, prac­ti­cal and ap­peal­ing ver­sion of the Prius – Toy­ota’s ef­fi­ciency champ. The lat­est 1.8 litre Altis Hy­brid is hand­some, spa­cious and de­cently equipped. Slot­ting a hy­brid sys­tem into it only makes it bet­ter.</p>
    <p>The Toy­ota Corolla Altis Hy­brid should be an ideal car for those look­ing for the ef­fi­ciency of a Prius and the stately prac­ti­cal­ity of a Corolla.</p>
    <p>Buy­ers have been known to be put off by the Prius’ avant-garde styling, its strong as­so­ci­a­tion with taxis and pri­vate-hire cars, and its rel­a­tively high price. The proof is in the per­sis­tently poor sales.</p>
    <p>The Corolla Altis, on the other hand, has estab­lished it­self as an in­of­fen­sive car for all sea­sons. The lat­est model is ac­tu­ally quite hand­some, spa­cious and de­cently equipped. Slot­ting a hy­brid sys­tem into it only makes it bet­ter.</p>
    <p>The 1.8-litre Corolla Altis Hy­brid has a stated fuel con­sump­tion of 4.4 litres/100km, ver­sus the 1.6-litre non-hy­brid’s 6.4 litres/100km. But in real life, the hy­brid achieves 4 litres/100km (driven mostly in Eco mode), ver­sus the non-hy­brid’s 9 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>The 5-litre dif­fer­ence trans­lates into sav­ings of more than $1,300 a year, go­ing by the av­er­age mileage of around 16,000km and the av­er­age petrol price of $1.70 per litre.</p>
    <p>Alas, this cost ad­van­tage is wiped out by the higher sell­ing price of the hy­brid. The car costs $16,000 more than the El­e­gance vari­ant of the Corolla, which trans­lates into $1,600 a year over the life­span of the car. The Hy­brid’s 1.8-litre en­gine at­tracts $234 more in road tax a year.</p>
    <p>So the more en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly car costs $1,834 more a year – ver­sus its fuel sav­ings of $1,300 or so. Thus, a buyer ends up pay­ing around $500 more a year to drive the petrol-elec­tric Corolla.</p>
    <p>To those who care about na­ture and the air we breathe, it is a price worth pay­ing. But for oth­ers, the sums do not add up favourably for the twin-pow­ered Toy­ota.</p>
    <p>But per­haps the hy­brid Corolla should be com­pared with the Prius, the orig­i­nal petrol-elec­tric car.</p>
    <p>Be­sides be­ing eas­ier on the eye and rarely be­ing mis­taken for a cab, the Corolla has one other sig­nif­i­cant trump card: its cabin space. It is on the whole roomier than the Prius and also less ex­pen­sive – $36,000 less – than the Prius.</p>
    <p>Be­ing a ded­i­cated econ­omy car, the Prius is, of course, more ef­fi­cient. But the ad­van­tage is slight. Over a year, the Prius’ sav­ings over the hy­brid Corolla works out to be around $100. Or $1,000 over 10 years – hardly enough to make a dent in the Prius’ price pre­mium. Since both have 1.8-litre en­gines, there is no road tax dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Equip­ment-wise, the Corolla Altis Hy­brid sits a lit­tle closer to the mod­ern Prius. I find its elec­tronic park­ing brake with au­to­matic Hold func­tion most use­ful. Tech­nol­o­gy­wise, its hy­brid sys­tem still uses a nickel metal hy­dride bat­tery, while most ri­vals have switched to lithium-ion units, which are lighter and more com­pact. In fact, the Prius+ al­ready uses lithium-ion.</p>
    <p>At the wheel, the Corolla Altis Hy­brid is leisurely and re­fined. Its con­tin­u­ously vari­able trans­mis­sion is not as rub­ber­band-like as most oth­ers. In ex­e­cu­tion, the Corolla’s well­tested for­mula for sim­plic­ity, logic and user-friend­li­ness per­me­ates.</p>
    <p>You get the same fa­mil­iar ride and han­dling as the Corolla, with slightly less per­for­mance on ac­count of its ad­di­tional weight.</p>
    <p>On the whole, it is a car with an ef­fi­ciency which just about matches the Prius’, but with more space, ver­sa­til­ity and mass ap­peal. As for to­tal cost, it is closer to the Corolla than it is to the Prius, which is a good thing.</p>
    <p>All Toy­ota needs to do now is make a hy­brid which is cheaper to own and run than the Corolla.</p>
