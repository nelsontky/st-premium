    <p>While many or­gan­i­sa­tions are fo­cus­ing on how to pro­tect their em­ploy­ees’ phys­i­cal health dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, less at­ten­tion has been de­voted to men­tal health, said In­ter­na­tional SOS med­i­cal di­rec­tor Low Kiang Wei.</p>
    <p>But men­tal health is j ust as im­por­tant as phys­i­cal health, es­pe­cially at a time when peo­ple are fac­ing mul­ti­ple stres­sors, an un­prece­dented change in daily ac­tiv­i­ties and wide­spread un­cer­tainty about the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Dr Low gives tips on how em­ploy­ees can main­tain a healthy mind dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>AC­CEPT YOUR WOR­RIES</p>
    <p>Em­brac­ing rather than sup­press­ing emo­tional re­ac­tions to the pan­demic can have a pos­i­tive im­pact, as you may de­velop a deeper un­der­stand­ing of the dan­gers and nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions to mit­i­gate the risks.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>FO­CUS ON WHAT YOU CAN CON­TROL</p>
    <p>Con­sider as­pects of the sit­u­a­tion that you can and can­not con­trol. For those who can­not work from home, fo­cus on mea­sures that can re­duce the risk of con­tract­ing the virus, such as wash­ing your hands and wear­ing a mask, to as­sert a greater sense of con­trol in an un­cer­tain sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>MAIN­TAIN HEALTHY BOUND­ARIES BE­TWEEN WORK AND HOME</p>
    <p>For those who work from home, it can be tempt­ing to do their work in bed. In­stead, try to keep to a des­ig­nated space just for work. This helps main­tain the bound­aries be­tween work and home life, and min­imises dis­trac­tions or in­ter­rup­tions from fam­ily mem­bers or pets or the lure of go­ing back to bed.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>CRE­ATE NEW GOALS</p>
    <p>While your pre­vi­ous long-term plans or goals for the year might have to be scrapped, try to set small, re­al­is­tic and spe­cific goals.</p>
    <p>These weekly or monthly goals can be any­thing that is achiev­able and en­joy­able to you – be it ex­er­cise goals or plan­ning small so­cial gath­er­ings that will give you a sense of ac­com­plish­ment.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>MAKE TIME FOR REST</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple may find them­selves work­ing longer hours while work­ing from home be­cause they are not teth­ered to the work­place and can work any­where, any time.</p>
    <p>As­sess your work rou­tine and make sure you are tak­ing breaks dur­ing the day. Con­sider tak­ing your an­nual leave even if you are not go­ing away.</p>
    <p>It can also be re­fresh­ing to make time for ac­tiv­i­ties that you might have missed for the past few months, such as con­nect­ing with friends or col­leagues.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>DON’T BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who feel over­whelmed should seek the sup­port of men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als such as coun­sel­lors and psy­chol­o­gists. They can of­fer dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives or guide em­ploy­ees to re­alise pos­si­ble so­lu­tions by re­fram­ing is­sues that seemed in­tractable, or lend a lis­ten­ing ear to those in dis­tress.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>BE KIND TO YOUR­SELF</p>
    <p>Recog­nise that it is nor­mal to find the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion hard and that you will have good and bad days. Ac­knowl­edge what you are achiev­ing and lower your ex­pec­ta­tions of your­self as your men­tal, emo­tional, so­cial and phys­i­cal re­sources are de­pleted.</p>
