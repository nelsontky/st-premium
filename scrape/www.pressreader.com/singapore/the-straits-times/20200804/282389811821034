    <p>1 FIC­TION/POETRY FOOD REPUB­LIC</p>
    <p>Edited by Ann Ang, Daryl Lim Wei Jie and Tse Hao Guang Land­mark Books/ Pa­per­back/ 216 pages/ $32.10/ Avail­able at bit.ly/FoodRepub­lic_ALT</p>
    <p>“When the world ends, you will be eat­ing Hokkien mee,” writes Sin­ga­porean poet Stephanie Chan in this smor­gas­bord of prose and poetry about lo­cal food.</p>
    <p>From the apoc­a­lyp­tic to the ev­ery­day, it col­lects 88 pieces by 59 au­thors, rang­ing from veter­ans such as Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ents Ed­win Thum­boo and Lee Tzu Pheng to fresh faces such as Valen Lim and Wahid Al Ma­mun.</p>
    <p>The an­thol­ogy was born when ed­i­tors Lim, 29, and Tse, 31, were dis­cussing the restau­rant for­merly known as Sushiro, now Omote, which had gone vi­ral for the grandil­o­quent lan­guage used to de­scribe its dishes (“caviar com­po­si­tion is ev­er­more the kosher desider­a­tum to the epi­curean soul”).</p>
    <p>“I sud­denly came to the re­al­i­sa­tion that Sin­ga­pore, de­spite be­ing a food-ob­sessed nation, did not have an an­thol­ogy of lit­er­ary food writ­ing,” says Lim.</p>
    <p>The an­thol­ogy is di­vided into five sec­tions – “a kind of food court, with five stalls”, says Lim – with each sec­tion rep­re­sent­ing a dif­fer­ent theme. For in­stance, Come Daily Chicken Rice chron­i­cles the mun­dane, while Dr M. Sel­varaj’s Mock Meat Deli fea­tures strange and desta­bil­is­ing ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>The an­thol­ogy is multi-gen­er­a­tional, with pieces rang­ing from the late Arthur Yap’s sem­i­nal poem, the cor­rect­ness of flavour, in which a sher­bet shop be­comes a far­ci­cal bat­tle­ground for English ver­sus Singlish, to “Be­sok sun­rise egg still put” by Hamid Roslan, who is short­listed for this year’s Sin­ga­pore Lit­er­a­ture Prize.</p>
    <p>Some works, such as Bran­don Chew’s non-fic­tion pieces Brunch At Berseh and A Map Of Sele­tar, doc­u­ment en­dan­gered or lost food ex­pe­ri­ences. Oth­ers move in more fan­tas­ti­cal realms, such as Ng YiSheng’s short story Hawker, in which a bak chor mee seller re­veals her myth­i­cal se­cret in­gre­di­ent.</p>
    <p>The line be­tween con­sumers and prod­ucts for con­sump­tion is also blurred in bizarre ways, as seen in Anu­rak Sae­laow’s poem SelfPor­trait As Sheng Shiong Out­let.</p>
    <p>The ed­i­tors say they wanted to look be­yond the no­tion of “food her­itage” in their se­lec­tions.</p>
    <p>Ang, 35, says: “It is not only the past that is worth sav­ing, but also the way in which th­ese food mem­o­ries get lived out to­day. How, what and when we eat struc­tures our day, and in turn the years, and be­comes part of our psy­chic ge­og­ra­phy.”</p>
    <p>She con­trib­uted the an­thol­ogy’s last piece, Makan Again, which is based on her own ex­pe­ri­ence of serv­ing a stay-home no­tice (SHN) at a gov­ern­ment-des­ig­nated ho­tel af­ter re­turn­ing from Bri­tain, where she is do­ing a PhD in English at Ox­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>She ob­serves that the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod made peo­ple relook what they took for granted, such as the free­dom and con­ve­nience of “go­ing down­stairs to makan” or even hav­ing food in the re­frig­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>“The pre­car­ity and fear of those days was bal­anced by ev­ery­one’s in­tense in­ter­est in what and how they would eat, and the peo­ple on SHN re­ceived a large amount of me­dia in­ter­est in their food.</p>
    <p>“I see it as a way of hold­ing on to some­thing fa­mil­iar and easy to digest at a time when the world was up­side down. If you can still cook in­stant noo­dles, that means some­thing – it means you got to NTUC in time to buy the packet.”</p>
    <p>2 FIC­TION A FICKLE AND REST­LESS WEAPON</p>
    <p>By Ja­son Erik Lund­berg Epi­gram Books/ Pa­per­back/ 456 pages/$26.64/ Avail­able at bit.ly/FRWeapon_EL</p>
    <p>In his de­but novel, Lund­berg re­turns to the is­land nation of Tin­hau, where his 2019 novella, Di­ary Of One Who Dis­ap­peared, was also set.</p>

    <p>Zed finds him­self drawn to Tara, a graphic de­signer with con­nec­tions to Red Dhole, while his cre­ative part­ner, pup­peteer Vahid Nabizadeh, gets caught up in po­lit­i­cal and fi­nan­cial in­trigue. Then the Range, a mys­te­ri­ous, de­struc­tive cloud for­ma­tion, at­tacks Tin­hau.</p>

    <p>With six sil­ver dol­lars that his mother had scrounged by ar­rang­ing his mar­riage with the daugh­ter of dis­tant rel­a­tives, Leong made his for­tune by min­ing tin in Ipoh.</p>
