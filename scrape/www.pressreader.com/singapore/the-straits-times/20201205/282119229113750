    <p>Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Ong Yao Min high­lighted valid points about co­ex­ist­ing with wildlife (Grow­ing a ‘city in na­ture’ needs care­ful man­age­ment, Nov 26).</p>
    <p>In Mel­bourne, Aus­tralia, where I lived and worked for more than half a decade, dur­ing the mag­pies’ breed­ing sea­son ev­ery spring, res­i­dents have to put up with “swoop­ing sea­son” – the ter­ri­to­rial birds swoop on peo­ple to pro­tect their eggs and off­spring.</p>
    <p>This is a real haz­ard for peo­ple, with reg­u­lar re­ports of in­juries caused by swoop­ing mag­pies, in­clud­ing claw­ing and eye wounds.</p>
    <p>But de­spite this, there has not been pub­lic calls for the mag­pies to be culled. In fact, all wildlife na­tive to Vic­to­ria state is pro­tected by law – it is il­le­gal to ha­rass or harm na­tive birds and other wildlife.</p>
    <p>There is, in­stead, pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion. There are in­ter­ac­tive maps to cre­ate aware­ness of swoop­ing ar­eas to help peo­ple avoid ven­tur­ing into mag­pie ter­ri­to­ries, as well as tips to pro­tect against claw­ing and other swoop­ing-re­lated in­juries, such as by wear­ing hel­mets or car­ry­ing um­brel­las.</p>
    <p>There may still be the odd oc­ca­sion when an en­counter with wildlife re­quires cal­i­brated hu­man in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>At­tacks by wild boars and ma­raud­ing mon­keys, for in­stance, may mean that their pop­u­la­tions have be­come too big to be sus­tain­able. These an­i­mals may have to be cap­tured, or ap­pro­pri­ate coun­ter­mea­sures may have to be taken.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the mat­ter of co­ex­ist­ing with wildlife cer­tainly could be fur­ther stud­ied, and Sin­ga­pore­ans can be en­gaged through pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion, com­ple­ment­ing what an­i­mal wel­fare groups are al­ready do­ing.</p>
    <p>It is said that the moral­ity of a na­tion can of­ten be judged by the way it treats its an­i­mals.</p>
