    <p>WASHINGTON • The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is push­ing the sale of seven large pack­ages of weapons to Tai­wan, in­clud­ing long-range mis­siles that would al­low Tai­wanese jets to hit dis­tant Chi­nese tar­gets in the event of a con­flict, say of­fi­cials fa­mil­iar with the pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>If ap­proved by Congress, the pack­ages, val­ued in the bil­lions of dol­lars, would be one of the largest weapon trans­fers in re­cent years to Tai­wan. The ad­min­is­tra­tion plans to in­for­mally no­tify law­mak­ers of the sale within weeks.</p>
    <p>By law, the United States gov­ern­ment is re­quired to pro­vide weapons of a de­fen­sive na­ture to Tai­wan, a self-gov­ern­ing, demo­cratic is­land.</p>
    <p>China, which claims Tai­wan as part of its ter­ri­tory, has es­ca­lated its military ac­tiv­ity near the is­land af­ter Tai­wan’s Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing­wen won re-elec­tion in Jan­uary by beat­ing a can­di­date viewed as friend­lier to Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Some ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials see bol­ster­ing Tai­wan as an im­por­tant part of cre­at­ing a broader military coun­ter­weight to China in Asia.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has strong bi­par­ti­san sup­port in Congress, so ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials ex­pect law­mak­ers to ap­prove the arms sales.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween the US and China have plum­meted to their low­est point in decades, as the two na­tions openly chal­lenge each other on a wide range of is­sues, in­clud­ing trade, tech­nol­ogy and military dom­i­nance of Asia.</p>
    <p>The most sen­si­tive weapon sys­tem of the pro­posed pack­ages to</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is an air-to-ground mis­sile, the Boe­ing AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of its range, it can be fired by jets fly­ing be­yond the reach of China’s air de­fence sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The mis­siles could hit tar­gets on the Chi­nese main­land or at sea, in­clud­ing war­ships try­ing to cross the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed sale of the mis­sile, which is likely to cause con­cern among Chi­nese military of­fi­cials, has not been pre­vi­ously re­ported.</p>
    <p>The mis­siles can be used with F-16 fighter jets that the US has sold to Tai­wan. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion an­nounced last year that it was sell­ing 66 such jets at US$8 bil­lion (S$10.86 bil­lion), one of the sin­gle largest arms pack­ages to the is­land in many years.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the cur­rent pro</p>
    <p>posed sale in­cludes sur­veil­lance drones that are an un­armed ver­sion of the Reaper model made by Gen­eral Atomics; a truck-based rocket ar­tillery sys­tem made by Lock­heed Martin; land-based Har­poon an­ti­ship mis­siles from Boe­ing; and sea mines. Reuters re­ported as­pects of the pack­ages on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“The US is in­creas­ingly con­cerned that de­ter­rence is weak­en­ing as Chi­nese military ca­pa­bil­i­ties grow,” said Ms Bon­nie Glaser, a se­nior ad­viser for Asia at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“The items in this pack­age will help in­crease Tai­wan’s abil­ity to pre­vent a Chi­nese in­va­sion – es­sen­tially, to hold out longer.”</p>
    <p>But she added: “Weapons pro­cure­ments are only one part of that equa­tion. The US is also urg­ing Tai­wan to re­build its re­serves and con­duct more real-world train­ing.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Evan Medeiros from Ge­orge­town Univer­sity, a for­mer se­nior Asia direc­tor at the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, said China might im­pose sanc­tions on a few com­pa­nies in­volved in the pro­posed sale, “but strate­gi­cally they are fo­cused on pre­serv­ing sta­bil­ity in US-China re­la­tions right now”.</p>
    <p>Prof Medeiros and other US of­fi­cials have pressed Tai­wanese of­fi­cials over the past decade to buy weapons that would en­hance de­ter­rence and in­crease the is­land military’s abil­i­ties to hold off Chi­nese forces in a mean­ing­ful way.</p>
    <p>Prof Medeiros said that with the cur­rent pro­posed sale, “Tai­wan is fi­nally buy­ing what it re­ally needs to im­ple­ment its asym­met­ric de­fence strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bit tardy to this gar­den party, but Tai­wan’s lead­ers are fi­nally com­mit­ting se­ri­ous re­sources.”</p>
