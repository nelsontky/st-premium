    <p>Pub­lic en­gage­ment can­not be onesided, and the Gov­ern­ment must lis­ten to ground sen­ti­ment to iden­tify the is­sues peo­ple care about, said Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran.</p>
    <p>At a cer­e­mony yes­ter­day to mark the ap­point­ment of su­per­vi­sory panel mem­bers to gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach, the min­is­ter said this two-way en­gage­ment is needed.</p>
    <p>“On the one hand, (there are) pri­or­i­ties that the Gov­ern­ment has iden­ti­fied, but at the same time, (there is a need) also to en­gage the broad base of ci­ti­zens to un­der­stand what their con­cerns are, and what are the kinds of is­sues that they would like to ad­dress,” he added.</p>
    <p>In his speech at the Min­istry of Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, Mr Iswaran high­lighted the role Reach played amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It tapped tech­nol­ogy so ci­ti­zens’ views could still be heard de­spite so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, he said.</p>
    <p>By go­ing dig­i­tal and con­duct­ing its sur­veys on­line, Reach man­aged to en­gage 56,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans this year.</p>
    <p>They in­clude those in sec­tors badly hit by the coro­n­avirus, such as the avi­a­tion and food and bev­er­age in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>With large phys­i­cal dia­logues dis­al­lowed due to so­cial dis­tanc­ing, Reach has been con­duct­ing vir­tual ses­sions to en­sure that it keeps its ears to the ground, said Mr Iswaran.</p>
    <p>Some of these dia­logues were held in hy­brid ways that mixed phys­i­cal and on­line in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran said: “These new con­ver­sa­tions on we­bi­nars and hy­brid ap­proaches that are tak­ing place are very good ex­am­ples of how we are adapt­ing, and we need to con­tinue to adapt.</p>
    <p>“And I think this is some­thing that is not just Covid-re­lated, but it should sur­vive Covid, be­cause it gives us a com­pletely new and dy­namic plat­form, which we can use.”</p>
    <p>The Reach su­per­vi­sory panel, which sees changes to per­son­nel ev­ery two years, now has 39 mem­bers, in­clud­ing 27 new mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The new panel, the eighth since it was launched in 2006, was ap­pointed in Oc­to­ber. It is the largest in the unit’s his­tory. The pre­vi­ous panel had 29 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Reach started out as the Feed­back Unit (FBU) in 1985, be­fore be­ing re­struc­tured and re­named in 2006.</p>
    <p>The unit is chaired by Min­is­ter of</p>
    <p>State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Tan Kiat How.</p>
    <p>He is as­sisted by three vice-chair­men: Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as­sis­tant sec­re­tarygen­eral Pa­trick Tay; Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam; and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth as well as So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Eric Chua.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Reach said that it will con­tinue to deepen en­gage­ment with Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the unit will fo­cus on three groups: Com­mu­nity and in­ter­est groups, whose en­gage­ment will be led by Ms Ra­hayu; youth, who will be over­seen by Mr Chua; and pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMET), with Mr Tay in charge.</p>
    <p>Among the 39 Reach su­per­vi­sory panel mem­bers are 15 young peo­ple rep­re­sent­ing the six au­ton­o­mous uni­ver­si­ties, five poly­tech­nics and three In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) col­leges, as well as the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the new panel com­po­si­tion, Mr Tan said: “Sin­ga­pore to­day is more di­verse than ever be­fore.</p>
    <p>“But we are com­mit­ted to lis­ten­ing to the views of all Sin­ga­pore­ans be­cause ev­ery voice mat­ters.”</p>
    <p>Reach said the young panel mem­bers will have many op­por­tu­ni­ties to run ground-up en­gage­ment ini­tia­tives with Reach’s sup­port.</p>
    <p>These new con­ver­sa­tions on we­bi­nars and hy­brid ap­proaches that are tak­ing place are very good ex­am­ples of how we are adapt­ing, and we need to con­tinue to adapt. And I think this is some­thing that is not just Covid-re­lated, but it should sur­vive Covid, be­cause it gives us a com­pletely new and dy­namic plat­form, which we can use.</p>
