    <p>Madam Yeo Ai was all of 23 in 1964 when the young seam­stress fell in love with the boy next door.</p>
    <p>It was a whirl­wind ro­mance – they got mar­ried in three months and moved into his house right across the street from her home.</p>
    <p>Over the next six decades, she raised 11 chil­dren in the two­s­torey house in Gey­lang Lorong 3.</p>
    <p>Madam Yeo, now 79, is one of 37 home own­ers who will have to va­cate their homes by Dec 31, when the es­tate’s 60-year lease ex­pires.</p>
    <p>Her home holds a life­time of mem­o­ries, in­clud­ing the decades she spent with her hus­band, who died seven years ago.</p>
    <p>Madam Yeo, speak­ing in Man­darin, said: “Back then, on the wed­ding day, it was the tra­di­tion for the groom to pick up the bride from her house and drive to his house. But be­cause we lived just op­po­site each other, we took a drive around the es­tate in­stead.”</p>
    <p>Their wed­ding din­ner was a grand and lively af­fair, with ta­bles set up along the road for their fam­i­lies, friends and neigh­bours to min­gle and dine late into the night.</p>
    <p>The es­tate, lo­cated off Up­per Boon Keng Road, is no longer as vi­brant. Gone are the kam­pung days when neigh­bours kept their front gates open all day and shared food with one an­other. In the past decade, as leases dwin­dled, many of the orig­i­nal home own­ers ei­ther sold their units or moved out and rented them to for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>Madam Yeo has made peace with hav­ing to move out, but this does not make it any eas­ier.</p>
    <p>She has been pack­ing up a life­time’s pos­ses­sions as she pre­pares to move into her daugh­ter’s Hous­ing Board (HDB) flat in Sims Drive at the end of this month.</p>
    <p>Even t hen, t here are some things she will have to leave be­hind – space in the HDB flat is lim­ited. There is her favourite char­coal stove that she uses to boil soup nearly ev­ery day, and an antique fridge that still works.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to a rusty hook hang­ing from the liv­ing room ceil­ing, Madam Yeo said: “Over the years, many chil­dren have fallen asleep in the sarong cra­dle I hung here.”</p>
    <p>Of the 11 chil­dren she has raised, two are her own, two are her grand­chil­dren and two are those of close rel­a­tives. The re­main­ing five chil­dren, from three dif­fer­ent fam­i­lies, in­cluded three broth­ers that Madam Yeo was paid $800 a month to take care of.</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter Joyce Koh, 56, who works in the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, said all the chil­dren still visit her mother from time to time. “My mother’s cook­ing is what keeps them com­ing back. One of the boys came to the house al­most ev­ery day for din­ner un­til he had to serve his na­tional ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>Ev­ery Chi­nese New Year, Madam Yeo makes about 2,000 ang ku kueh (red tor­toise cakes) with the help of rel­a­tives. “Some peo­ple have joked that the tra­di­tional kueh we make are the most pop­u­lar ex­ports from Gey­lang Lorong 3,” she said.</p>
    <p>“When I move into an HDB flat, I can’t make this quan­tity any more.”</p>
