    <p>Work­ing from home dur­ing the pan­demic might be caus­ing many of us to lead more seden­tary life­styles than is con­sid­ered healthy.</p>
    <p>For now, don­ning our face masks and go­ing to well-ven­ti­lated places are prob­a­bly the safest pre­cau­tions we can take when head­ing out­doors for some fresh air or leisurely ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Think­ing of go­ing for a jog or cy­cling at the park? Click your way to Safe Dis­tance @ Parks (safedist­parks.nparks.gov.sg) be­fore leav­ing the house.</p>
    <p>The por­tal by Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) is up­dated with real-time data from staff on ground, vis­i­tor count sys­tems and drones, so you can con­sider vis­it­ing a less-crowded park and main­tain­ing a safe dis­tance from oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Here are some out­door ac­tiv­i­ties you can in­dulge safely in dur­ing Phase 2:</p>
    <p>Walk and learn</p>
    <p>Go on an ed­u­ca­tional walk­ing trail with The Kal­lang Story: A Sports, Arts and Her­itage Trail, launched by the Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub last May.</p>
    <p>Fea­tur­ing three walk­ing trails — the Water­front Trail, Stadium Trail and Park Trail — this tour will high­light both past and present land­marks in the Kal­lang area.</p>
    <p>Eigh­teen her­itage mark­ers, 4,000 steps and ap­prox­i­mately 3km later, you will learn all about Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory and achieve­ments in wa­ter sports, the former Na­tional Stadium, plus some of the na­tion’s most iconic en­ter­tain­ment fa­cil­i­ties back in the day, in­clud­ing Kal­lang Cin­ema — once the largest cin­ema in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Is­land fun</p>
    <p>While waiting for leisure travel to re­sume, sched­ule an es­cape to Sen­tosa Is­land, a des­ti­na­tion that teems with out­door ac­tiv­i­ties to en­ter­tain the whole fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Pic­nic on one of the beaches — Siloso, Palawan or Tan­jong beach — or ex­plore Fort Siloso, Sin­ga­pore’s only pre­served coastal fort with an on-site mil­i­tary mu­seum. To get there, take a short but scenic tree­top trek, known as Fort Siloso Sky­walk, which tow­ers 11 storeys above the ground.</p>
    <p>Theme park Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore has also re­opened with re­vised open­ing days and hours with en­hanced safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place for the safety of both visitors and staff. While shows and street en­ter­tain­ment are cur­rently sus­pended, you can still have a go on most rides and meet your favourite char­ac­ters. Vir­tual queue tick­ets with re­turn time will be pro­vided for se­lected rides dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods and visitors are re­quired to wear their face masks at all times, ex­cept when eat­ing or drink­ing.</p>
