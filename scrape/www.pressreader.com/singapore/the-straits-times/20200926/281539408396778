    <p>China has de­tected its first lo­cal asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions in more than a month as two port work­ers re­spon­si­ble for un­load­ing frozen seafood tested pos­i­tive in Shan­dong prov­ince, adding to alarm that con­tam­i­nated im­ports could be trans­mit­ting the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • China has de­tected its first lo­cal asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions in more than a month as two port work­ers re­spon­si­ble for un­load­ing frozen seafood tested pos­i­tive, adding to alarm that con­tam­i­nated im­ports could be trans­mit­ting the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The two cases, found in Shan­dong prov­ince’s Qing­dao city dur­ing rou­tine test­ing of port work­ers on Thurs­day, were the first symp­tom-free in­fec­tions that China has re­ported since Aug 20.</p>
    <p>China has not re­ported any lo­cal symp­to­matic in­fec­tions since Aug 15 ei­ther. Un­like other na­tions, China sep­a­rates asymp­to­matic and symp­to­matic cases in its daily tally, and the for­mer are moved into the lat­ter cat­e­gory if and when they start show­ing signs of ill­ness.</p>
    <p>The new cases will in­ten­sify con­cern in China over whether im­ported prod­ucts are in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>While the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion has said there is no ev­i­dence the coro­n­avirus is trans­mit­ted on food or food pack­ag­ing, Chi­nese re­searchers have found that the virus on chilled salmon may be in­fec­tious for more than a week.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing num­ber of cases linked to cold stor­age and port work­ers is an on­go­ing mys­tery.</p>
    <p>There were resur­gences in the Chi­nese cities of Bei­jing and Dalian ear­lier this year con­nected to peo­ple work­ing with im­ported food prod­ucts, but ex­perts have been un­able to say con­clu­sively where the in­fec­tions came from.</p>
    <p>In New Zealand, a run of 102 days with­out a lo­cal virus case came to an end when a worker at a cold-stor­age plant in Auck­land fell sick last month. But of­fi­cials said pre­lim­i­nary find­ings from en­vi­ron­men­tal test­ing at the plant de­bunked the the­ory that the route of trans­mis­sion was through chilled sur­faces on ma­te­ri­als ar­riv­ing from over­seas.</p>
    <p>In Qing­dao, the lo­cal health com­mis­sion said 132 close con­tacts of the two pa­tients have been quar­an­tined, and 129 among them have tested neg­a­tive so far.</p>
    <p>China re­ported eight new Covid-19 cases on Thurs­day, com­pared with seven cases dis­closed a day ear­lier, the na­tional health author­ity said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion said in a state­ment that all new cases were im­ported in­fec­tions in­volv­ing trav­ellers from over­seas.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new asymp­to­matic cases fell to 18 from 20 a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of con­firmed Covid-19 in­fec­tions in main­land China now stands at 85,322, while the num­ber of to­tal deaths re­mains un­changed at 4,634.</p>
