    <p>The hands-on learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence suits me, and I wouldn’t mind sign­ing on with the RSAF as an air force en­gi­neer in fu­ture. (Work­ing in) the aero­space in­dus­try has been my child­hood dream and I’ve al­ways won­dered how planes fly, and how things work be­hind the scenes.</p>
    <p>PRI­VATE LIVANESH RAMU, who will be in the pi­o­neer co­hort of the new work-study pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) grad­u­ates serv­ing their na­tional ser­vice as air force tech­ni­cians can soon earn a diploma qual­i­fi­ca­tion while they are en­listed.</p>
    <p>About 20 trainees from April next year will be the first to un­dergo a pro­gramme by ITE and the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force (RSAF) that al­lows them to work and study at the same time.</p>
    <p>The work-study diploma in air­craft main­te­nance en­gi­neer­ing – the first of its kind for full-time na­tional ser­vice­men – will be con­ducted over 21/ years.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>The course will equip trainees with skills in the main­te­nance of air­craft struc­tures and sys­tems, and will serve as an al­ter­na­tive route for ITE grad­u­ates to­wards a ca­reer in the aero­space in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to ITE’s ex­ist­ing work­study diplo­mas, 70 per cent of the course cur­ricu­lum will be de­liv­ered through on-the-job train­ing at RSAF, and the re­main­ing 30 per cent will com­prise the­ory and prac­ti­cal train­ing at ITE.</p>
    <p>Key in­dus­try play­ers – ST En­gi­neer­ing Aero­space, SIA En­gi­neer­ing and the As­so­ci­a­tion of Aero­space In­dus­tries (Sin­ga­pore) – helped to de­velop the train­ing cur­ricu­lum for the pro­gramme, which was launched yes­ter­day at a sign­ing cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, trainees will spend the first six months of their NS on ba­sic train­ing, be­fore start­ing the work­study course. They will need to ex­tend their ser­vice to a min­i­mum of three years with the RSAF.</p>
    <p>The course is open to fresh ITE grad­u­ates with rel­e­vant Nitec or Higher Nitec qual­i­fi­ca­tions such as aero­space tech­nol­ogy, mecha­tron­ics and ro­bot­ics or elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>Those who com­plete the pro­gramme may sign on as reg­u­lars and be em­ployed as air force en­gi­neers (main­te­nance) in the RSAF, or pur­sue re­lated jobs in air­craft main­te­nance in the aero­space in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Chief of Air Force, Ma­jor-Gen­eral Kelvin Khong, said: “In the cur­rent cli­mate, where the avi­a­tion sec­tor is hard hit by Covid-19, we need to con­tinue sup­port­ing em­ploy­ment and train­ing for work­ers in this sec­tor, so that the work­force is ready when avi­a­tion starts to re­cover, and we can help our avi­a­tion sec­tor emerge from this Covid-19 pan­demic stronger.”</p>
    <p>ITE chief ex­ec­u­tive Low Khah Gek said the pro­gramme “marks a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone in our con­tin­u­ing ef­forts to ex­pand skills up­grad­ing and ca­reer pro­gres­sion op­por­tu­ni­ties for our grad­u­ates”.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, ITE is ex­tend­ing an ex­ist­ing work-study diploma in elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing to its grad­u­ates serv­ing as army tech­ni­cians in NS, start­ing in April next year.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­ates with Nitec or Higher Nitec qual­i­fi­ca­tions in fields like aero­space avion­ics and elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing may ap­ply.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate Livanesh Ramu, 21, who will be in the pi­o­neer co­hort of the new work-study pro­gramme, said the idea of study­ing and ap­ply­ing his skills at work was a draw for him.</p>
    <p>“The hands-on learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence suits me, and I wouldn’t mind sign­ing on with the RSAF as an air force en­gi­neer in fu­ture,” said the ITE grad­u­ate, who has a Nitec qual­i­fi­ca­tion in me­chan­i­cal tech­nol­ogy and a Higher Nitec in en­gi­neer­ing with busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“(Work­ing in) the aero­space in­dus­try has been my child­hood dream and I’ve al­ways won­dered how planes fly, and how things work be­hind the scenes,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Philip Quek, pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Aero­space In­dus­tries (Sin­ga­pore), said: “De­spite the cur­rent slow­down in air trans­port, there is strong con­sen­sus that the midterm prospects for the Sin­ga­pore aero­space in­dus­try re­main pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“We must en­sure that we have the ca­pa­bil­i­ties and tal­ent to sup­port the up­turn in avi­a­tion when we even­tu­ally emerge from this cri­sis.”</p>
