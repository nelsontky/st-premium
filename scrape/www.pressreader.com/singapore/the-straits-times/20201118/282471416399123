    <p>Ms Chong uses in­stru­ments such as singing bowls, crys­tal bowls, tun­ing forks and koshi (wind chimes) to cre­ate sounds to “calm over­ac­tive brain waves” for those with insomnia and fre­quent mi­graines due to high lev­els of stress.</p>
    <p>“De­pend­ing on the pitch, the sounds can help peo­ple to re­lax or trig­ger trapped emo­tions such as anger and sad­ness and help to re­lease them,” she said.</p>
    <p>Over at Brahm Cen­tre, a men­tal well­ness char­ity, there has also been a rise in sign-ups for its five­day mind­ful­ness retreats.</p>
    <p>Ad­junct as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Angie Chew, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and prin­ci­pal at the cen­tre, said: “Be­fore the pan­demic, there would be about 25 peo­ple signed up, but now, there are 70 to 80 peo­ple sign­ing up for the retreats.”</p>
    <p>She con­ducts these retreats at ho­tels for 50 peo­ple on site, with the rest on video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom.</p>
    <p>Owner of SmileArts Den­tal Stu­dio, Dr Kenny Wong, at­tended a mind­ful­ness course at Brahm Cen­tre in Septem­ber, when he was anx­ious and dis­tressed. He said med­i­tat­ing has helped him to over­come neg­a­tive emo­tions and feel more re­laxed.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of stress at work be­cause rev­enue had re­duced sig­nif­i­cantly. This was due to a drop in pa­tients dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when we weren’t al­lowed to do many pro­ce­dures,” said the fa­ther of two chil­dren aged four and 11.</p>
    <p>Now, the 43-year-old den­tist en­sures that he med­i­tates for 20 min­utes every morn­ing, as well as in be­tween con­sul­ta­tions with pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Apart from in-per­son med­i­ta­tion pro­grammes, there are many pop­u­lar med­i­ta­tion apps. These in­clude Calm and Headspace, both of which have more than 40 mil­lion down­loads each.</p>
    <p>These apps teach re­lax­ation tech­niques that aim to ease symp­toms of anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion, as well as pro­mote bet­ter sleep.</p>
    <p>Though they can be use­ful as an in­tro­duc­tion to med­i­ta­tion, ex­perts say they are not sub­sti­tutes for learn­ing from cer­ti­fied or ex­pe­ri­enced teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Yii ob­served that at­tend­ing a class in per­son makes peo­ple feel more re­laxed and recharged.</p>
    <p>Amid the pan­demic, Dr Wong said med­i­tat­ing has helped him ac­cept that “what­ever hap­pened has hap­pened” and to “fo­cus on the present”.</p>
    <p>“Un­doubt­edly, there is a lot of anx­i­ety and un­cer­tainty dur­ing this pe­riod. Stress is in­evitable, but med­i­ta­tion has helped me to em­brace it and man­age it in a way that I don’t let it over­whelm me,” he said.</p>
