    <p>• Dickson Yeo, the Sin­ga­porean who pleaded guilty to spy­ing for China in the United States, was sen­tenced to 14 months in jail in a US court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Yeo, 39, has been in a Washington jail since he was ar­rested last Novem­ber, and his 11 months in jail will be cred­ited to­wards his sen­tence, said Judge Tanya Chutkan.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear when he will be de­ported from the US.</p>
    <p>At his sen­tenc­ing hear­ing, Yeo said he took full re­spon­si­bil­ity for his ac­tions and apol­o­gised for caus­ing harm to Amer­ica, but added that he was still “sym­pa­thetic to the Chi­nese cause”.</p>
    <p>Judge Chutkan said the na­ture of Yeo’s of­fence was se­ri­ous, but that she also took into ac­count his re­morse and co­op­er­a­tion with the Amer­i­can au­thor­i­ties in sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>From 2015 to last year, Yeo used so­cial me­dia to tar­get Amer­i­can mil­i­tary and gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees who had ac­cess to sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion, and per­suaded them to write re­ports for cash.</p>
    <p>Un­be­knownst to them, Yeo would pass the re­ports to his han­dlers in the Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Dickson Yeo, the Sin­ga­porean who pleaded guilty to spy­ing for China in the United States, said at his sen­tenc­ing hear­ing yes­ter­day that he was still sup­port­ive of China.</p>
    <p>“I am sym­pa­thetic to China’s po­si­tion, but it was not my in­ten­tion to harm any­one,” said Yeo, 39, who re­ceived 14 months in jail. “All I want to do is to go home to my fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>He said he took full re­spon­si­bil­ity for his ac­tions and thanked the US gov­ern­ment for show­ing pro­fes­sion­al­ism when han­dling his case.</p>
    <p>“But I am still sym­pa­thetic to the Chi­nese cause,” he said. “There is a gen­eral feel­ing in China that the US is out to, sort of, bleed China dry.”</p>
    <p>District Judge Tanya Chutkan said that de­spite Yeo’s sus­pi­cions of the US, he had been af­forded the full panoply of rights and due process, in­clud­ing ac­cess to a de­fence lawyer.</p>
    <p>“You are not be­ing pun­ished for your thoughts or for your po­lit­i­cal be­liefs,” she said. “I would note that you have been treated in a way that ex­hibits the best of our sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Yeo has been in a Washington jail since he was ar­rested last Novem­ber, and these 11 months in jail will be cred­ited to­wards his sen­tence, said Judge Chutkan.</p>
    <p>Prose­cu­tors asked for a sen­tence of 16 months in the light of Yeo’s co­op­er­a­tion with the au­thor­i­ties, while Yeo’s lawyer asked for a sen­tence of time served, which would have worked out to ap­prox­i­mately 13 months, in­clud­ing the time it would take for him to be re­moved from the US.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear when he will be de­ported from the US.</p>
    <p>“He did not be­tray Sin­ga­pore and he does not bear any mal­ice to­wards the United States or any US cit­i­zens. He was deeply at­tracted to China and its abil­ity to up­lift mil­lions from poverty with in­dus­trial pol­icy, which led him to be eas­ily in­flu­enced,” his lawyer Michelle Peter­son said in court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>In July, Yeo pleaded guilty to act­ing un­der the di­rec­tion of Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials to ob­tain sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion from Amer­i­can cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Then a PhD stu­dent at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy, Yeo used so­cial me­dia to tar­get Amer­i­can mil­i­tary and gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees who had ac­cess to sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion and per­suaded them to write re­ports for cash.</p>
    <p>Un­be­knownst to them and for at least four years from 2015 to last year, Yeo would pass these re­ports to his han­dlers in the Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Ask­ing for le­niency in sen­tenc­ing, Yeo’s lawyer said he was very re­morse­ful, had im­me­di­ately ac­cepted re­spon­si­bil­ity for his con­duct and held noth­ing back from the US au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“He deeply re­grets hav­ing got­ten caught up in the swirl of sat­is­fy­ing Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence re­quire­ments and com­pro­mis­ing his own in­tegrity,” she added.</p>
    <p>Yeo suf­fers from high blood pres­sure and anx­i­ety, as well as de­pres­sion and post trau­matic stress dis­or­der stem­ming from his na­tional ser­vice in Sin­ga­pore, said his lawyer.</p>
    <p>He was also lonely, broke and floun­der­ing aca­dem­i­cally when he was re­cruited by Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence ser­vices, she added.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese gave him more re­spect and dig­nity for the work he was do­ing than he was able to ob­tain from his ef­forts at academia,” she said, adding that Yeo ac­knowl­edged he was vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Yeo’s pro­fes­sional rep­u­ta­tion is now in ru­ins and he will have difficulty even se­cur­ing ba­sic em­ploy­ment in Sin­ga­pore, she said.</p>
    <p>“He wants noth­ing more than to re­turn to a quiet life with his par­ents,” she added.</p>
    <p>Prose­cu­tors said that Yeo’s con­duct was se­ri­ous and war­ranted a sig­nif­i­cant sen­tence.</p>
    <p>They ar­gued that he was prepar­ing to ob­tain clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion when he was ar­rested, and that his work for Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence ser­vices was not a one-off lapse in judg­ment.</p>
    <p>“The threat posed by the PRC (Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China) is grave and long term. De­fen­dant Yeo will­ingly be­came a part of that threat,” they said, not­ing that his work for Bei­jing came within the larger con­text of China’s on­go­ing theft of in­for­ma­tion from the US.</p>
    <p>“He un­der­stands that China seeks to di­min­ish US in­flu­ence in the world. In­deed, the de­fen­dant has ad­mit­ted that he was mo­ti­vated by a de­sire to help China do just that,” they said.</p>
    <p>“He used the trade­craft of es­pi­onage, and he ex­ploited the open­ness of Amer­i­can so­ci­ety and the In­ter­net,” they added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they also ac­knowl­edged that he pleaded guilty early in the case and co­op­er­ated with the US gov­ern­ment.</p>
