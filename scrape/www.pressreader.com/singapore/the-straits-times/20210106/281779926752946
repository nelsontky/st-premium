    <p>With­out doubt, 2020 was the most chal­leng­ing year for Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping since he took over the top job in the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) and the mil­i­tary in 2012.</p>
    <p>He steered the coun­try through its worst health cri­sis in re­cent history and grap­pled with an econ­omy hit hard by the global Covid-19 pan­demic, as well as a bruis­ing trade and tech­nol­ogy war with the United States that is not about to end.</p>
    <p>It was also a year in which he weath­ered in­tense scru­tiny and brick­bats on the in­ter­na­tional stage – from un­hap­pi­ness over the pan­demic and crit­i­cism over al­leged hu­man rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xin­jiang, to a nasty bor­der clash with In­dia and an ac­ri­mo­nious spat with Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion of the world’s big­gest ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing and a spate of bond de­faults by state-owned en­ter­prises fur­ther bat­tered the coun­try’s in­ter­na­tional im­age.</p>
    <p>China could con­sole it­self, how­ever, be­cause it ef­fec­tively con­tained the coro­n­avirus and ended ru­ral poverty last year.</p>
    <p>This year will be no less tax­ing. The plethora of prob­lems that China faced last year will not go away any time soon, par­tic­u­larly the grow­ing cho­rus of fear, sus­pi­cion and re­sent­ment against it.</p>
    <p>When the big­gest po­lit­i­cal event of the year rolls around in July – the CCP’s cen­te­nary – con­grat­u­la­tions will not be forth­com­ing from coun­tries an­tag­o­nis­tic to­wards it.</p>
    <p>While the out­go­ing Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has tar­geted the Com­mu­nist Party and even ag­i­tated for regime change, it re­mains to be seen how the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will treat a po­lit­i­cal en­tity with an ide­ol­ogy anath­ema to the US.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has in­di­cated he wants to en­gage and work with China while Beijing has re­peat­edly called for dia­logue.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi re­cently said that “a new win­dow of hope is open­ing”.</p>
    <p>A Com­mu­nist Party in­sider told The Straits Times, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity: “It was tan­ta­mount to an olive branch.”</p>
    <p>China has said last month it is will­ing to share data and lu­nar sam­ples ob­tained by its Chang’e 5 probe with the global sci­en­tific com­mu­nity, in­clud­ing the US, in an­other good­will ges­ture.</p>
    <p>“But we are not overly op­ti­mistic,” the in­sider said. To China’s dis­may, Mr Bi­den has also vowed to form an al­liance of democ­ra­cies which China views as an­other at­tempt to con­tain its rise.</p>
    <p>Last week , China reached an in­vest­ment agree­ment with the Euro­pean Union that would give Euro­pean com­pa­nies greater ac­cess to the Chi­nese mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nist Party sources and an­a­lysts say Beijing pulled out all the stops to court the EU for a deal in a bid to pre­vent the group’s 27 mem­bers from gang­ing up with the US.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther is China let­ting up on the mil­i­tary front.</p>
    <p>S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies as­so­ciate re­search fel­low James Char, a China scholar, said: “Although the US-China ri­valry will likely soften some­what af­ter Joe Bi­den as­sumes power, Beijing will con­tinue to be wary of Washington as it pushes ahead with en­hanc­ing its mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties to chal­lenge US supremacy in the western Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>“China’s mil­i­tary strate­gists will fo­cus much of their at­ten­tion on the US as they adopt a long-term ri­valry with Washington and this will con­tinue to be the case in 2021.”</p>
    <p>But whether China mends fences with Aus­tralia, Canada, In­dia and Swe­den will hinge in part on Amer­i­can good­will rec­i­proc­ity, although Beijing is un­likely to back down over its “core in­ter­ests”, such as Hong Kong, Tai­wan, Xin­jiang, Ti­bet and the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>And who from Tai­wan – which Beijing claims as a prov­ince – will the US al­low to at­tend Mr Bi­den’s vir­tual in­au­gu­ra­tion will be a barom­e­ter of things to come.</p>
    <p>ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>As China con­tin­ues to man­age its ex­ter­nal chal­lenges, grow­ing the econ­omy will be one of Mr Xi’s top pri­or­i­ties this year.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese econ­omy roared back in the sec­ond and third quar­ters last year, post­ing 3.2 per cent and 4.9 per cent growth re­spec­tively, af­ter slump­ing 6.8 per cent in the first quar­ter be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The World Bank has fore­cast China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth at 2 per cent for last year, “boosted by gov­ern­ment spend­ing, strong ex­ports and a low rate of new Covid-19 in­fec­tions since March, but checked by slow do­mes­tic con­sump­tion”.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) put the fig­ure at 1.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>The World Bank fore­cast China’s GDP growth this year at 7.9 per cent, com­pared with the IMF’s 8.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists say do­mes­tic de­mand will have room to grow this year, as con­sumers look to spend ex­cess sav­ings ac­cu­mu­lated since last year, and as con­fi­dence over the coun­try’s Covid-19 con­tain­ment is re­in­forced.</p>
    <p>On Dec 26, the Com­merce Min­istry set out its key agenda for the new year: to push up do­mes­tic de­mand, clear hur­dles to build­ing a sys­tem of in­ter­nal pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion, and even­tu­ally cre­ate a strong do­mes­tic mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Although the US-China ri­valry will likely soften some­what af­ter Joe Bi­den as­sumes power, Beijing will con­tinue to be wary of Washington as it pushes ahead with en­hanc­ing its mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties to chal­lenge US supremacy in the western Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 CON­TROL</p>
    <p>Keep­ing Covid-19 in check will also re­main a pri­or­ity for Pres­i­dent Xi and his per­sonal pres­tige, given the CCP cen­te­nary in July.</p>
    <p>“He would def­i­nitely want to en­sure sta­bil­ity reigns in the run-up to that an­niver­sary,” said Mr Char.</p>
    <p>“On the global stage, we can also ex­pect him to con­tinue to push through the coun­try’s vac­cine diplo­macy and present China as a cooper­a­tive global part­ner in the fight against Covid-19, es­pe­cially dur­ing the Apec (Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion) sum­mit come Fe­bru­ary,” he said.</p>
