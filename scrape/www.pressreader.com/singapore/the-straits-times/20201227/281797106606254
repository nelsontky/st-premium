    <p>Lead­ers in Britain and the Euro­pean Union are scram­bling to per­suade their na­tional Par­lia­ments to rat­ify a his­toric deal due to come into ef­fect at the start of the new year and de­signed to min­imise the eco­nomic dis­rup­tion cre­ated by Britain’s de­ci­sion to leave the bloc.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment struck on Christ­mas Eve af­ter the last-minute in­ter­ven­tion of</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen is the most sig­nif­i­cant sin­gle trade agree­ment Europe has ever con­tem­plated, af­fect­ing a to­tal of £660 bil­lion (S$1.18 tril­lion) in yearly bi­lat­eral trade.</p>
    <p>It en­sures that nei­ther Britain nor the EU will im­pose tar­iffs on each other’s goods, and a zero-quota agree­ment would mean no limit on the quan­tity of any goods that could be traded.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the treaty needs to be rat­i­fied by all the Par­lia­ments of the EU’s ex­ist­ing 27 mem­ber states, plus that of the Bri­tish, and the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>And with its more than 1,200 pages of closely typed and tech­ni­cal text yet to be fully re­viewed, politi­cians in Britain and Europe are rush­ing to claim that their side has won the most con­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>Three out­stand­ing is­sues had ear­lier pre­vented the conclusion of a trade agree­ment. The first was com­pe­ti­tion. Both the Bri­tish and the EU agreed on rules to en­sure nei­ther side in­tro­duces sub­si­dies or tax ad­van­tages to di­vert trade. But they dis­agreed over how long the two sides need to re­spect the same rules.</p>
    <p>Dis­agree­ment also per­sisted over how the free trade deal would be po­liced, with the Bri­tish re­fus­ing to ac­cept that EU courts would rule on fu­ture trade dis­putes be­tween the two sides.</p>
    <p>And there was fish.</p>
    <p>The Euro­peans wanted to have con­tin­ued ac­cess to Britain’s fish-rich wa­ters; the Bri­tish replied that their wa­ters now lie out­side the EU, so EU fish­er­men can no longer ex­pect ac­cess.</p>
    <p>The Christ­mas Eve deal re­solved these dif­fer­ences. The Bri­tish al­lowed con­tin­ued Euro­pean rights in their fish­ing wa­ters for a fur­ther five years. The EU ac­cepted that its courts would not have ju­ris­dic­tion over trade with the United King­dom. And both sides agreed on a set of rules to en­sure fair trade.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, none of the</p>
    <p>night­mare sce­nar­ios pre­dicted for the start of the new year will come to pass: peo­ple and goods will con­tinue to move freely be­tween the UK and Europe, and few will no­tice any dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, Mr John­son claimed this vin­di­cates his stance that Britain can now have the best of both worlds, by keep­ing its trade with Europe undis­turbed while seek­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties else­where. “Ev­ery­thing the Bri­tish pub­lic was promised (was) de­liv­ered by this deal,” he said.</p>
    <p>From now on, Mr John­son claimed, the Bri­tish can “take full ad­van­tage of the fan­tas­tic op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able to us as an in­de­pen­dent trad­ing na­tion, strik­ing trade deals with other part­ners around the world”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit ne­go­tia­tor,</p>
    <p>was quick to point out that, while the deal safe­guards trade, it also means that the Bri­tish have cho­sen “to re­nounce the ben­e­fits and ad­van­tages en­joyed by EU mem­ber states”.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment does not cover, for in­stance, trade in ser­vices such as bank­ing, in­sur­ance and fi­nance – all cru­cial to the Bri­tish econ­omy. Nor does it grant Bri­tish peo­ple the right to work in other EU mem­ber states, or ben­e­fit from EU re­search grants.</p>
    <p>Since the deal is sup­ported by EU heavy­weights such as France and Ger­many, the chances are high that it will be rat­i­fied by the rest of the Euro­pean Par­lia­ments, es­pe­cially since most mem­ber states are de­lighted to see an end to this story.</p>
    <p>A more sig­nif­i­cant bat­tle will oc­cur in Britain, where Par­lia­ment</p>
    <p>will be re­called for an un­prece­dented spe­cial ses­sion on Wed­nes­day to rat­ify the treaty.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics ac­cuse Mr John­son of giv­ing away too much on EU fish­ing rights in Bri­tish wa­ters, a charge he de­nied in char­ac­ter­is­tic style by claim­ing that, even with the con­ces­sion he had to make on the is­sue, Britain would be re­claim­ing “enough fish to stretch to the South Pole and back”.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish leader is also charged with un­nec­es­sary haste: Par­lia­ment in Lon­don is ex­pected to rat­ify a deal of such mo­men­tous con­se­quences in a sin­gle day’s de­bate.</p>
    <p>Still, the treaty is likely to pass even be­fore most of those who vote for it be­come aware of all its pro­vi­sions.</p>
