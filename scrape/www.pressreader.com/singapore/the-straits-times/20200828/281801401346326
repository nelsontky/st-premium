    <p>In a sign of the times, Mr Chen Guangcheng, the con­tro­ver­sial Chi­nese ac­tivist who es­caped from China in 2012 with the help of Amer­i­can diplo­mats, spoke at the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion on Wed­nes­day night, on a day when US-China re­la­tions slid yet an­other notch in what has been a dra­matic de­te­ri­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“The CCP (Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party) is an en­emy of hu­man­ity… threat­en­ing the well-be­ing of the world,” said the vis­ually im­paired ac­tivist, read­ing off a Braille pad.</p>
    <p>“The US must use its val­ues of free­dom, democ­racy and rule of law to gather a coali­tion of other democ­ra­cies to stop the CCP’s ag­gres­sion.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Pres­i­dent Trump has led on this and we need other coun­tries to join in this fight.”</p>
    <p>For weeks now, the China is­sue has be­come a key plank of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re-election cam­paign – and the vol­ume of the rhetoric and the moves against China have been es­ca­lat­ing.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Wed­nes­day, the US an­nounced trade and visa re­stric­tions on 24 com­pa­nies for their ef­forts to help China “re­claim and mil­i­tarise dis­puted out­posts” in the con­tested South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Among the firms on a list is­sued by the Depart­ment of Com­merce are units of state-owned China Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Con­struc­tion</p>
    <p>Com­pany, one of the largest builders of projects un­der China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>A se­nior State Depart­ment of­fi­cial brief­ing jour­nal­ists said: “This is a first in a lot of ways in terms of US sanc­tions on this kind of ma­lign ac­tiv­ity in the South China Sea.”</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo an­nounced visa re­stric­tions on Chi­nese na­tion­als in­clud­ing “ex­ec­u­tives of state-owned en­ter­prises re­spon­si­ble for Bei­jing’s recla­ma­tion, con­struc­tion or mil­i­tari­sa­tion of dis­puted out­posts and co­er­cion of South-east Asian claimants”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in the South China Sea it­self, China launched four medium-range bal­lis­tic mis­siles on Wed­nes­day, as the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army con­ducted a se­ries of drills over sev­eral days across a wide mar­itime area.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous day, China’s De­fence</p>
    <p>Min­istry com­plained that a US high-al­ti­tude U-2 re­con­nais­sance plane had, with­out per­mis­sion, en­tered a no-fly zone where live drills were tak­ing place, de­mand­ing that the US cease such “provo­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>The phase one trade deal with China may be the “last sub­stan­tive thread of the US-China re­la­tion­ship”, Mr Bill Bishop, China an­a­lyst and pub­lisher of the Sinocism an­a­lyt­i­cal news­let­ter on China, wrote this week.</p>
    <p>“The rel­a­tive re­straint that Bei­jing has shown to­wards US ac­tions over the last sev­eral weeks is note­wor­thy,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“One the­ory I have heard is that Xi (Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping) et al are try­ing to avoid what they may see as a Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion trap to pro­voke a re­sponse from Bei­jing that would make it even harder for a pos­si­ble Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to take a ma­te­ri­ally softer line to­wards the PRC,” Mr Bishop said, re­fer­ring to the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>Eura­sia Group an­a­lysts said in an e-mail: “China’s immediate re­sponse will be stri­dent but mea­sured. But China could still re­spond with re­tal­ia­tory sanc­tions against US in­di­vid­u­als in roughly com­pa­ra­ble po­si­tions.”</p>
    <p>The con­sul­tancy said: “One of the big­gest risks through the rest of the year is an ac­ci­dent caused by overzeal­ous shad­ow­ing dur­ing mil­i­tary ex­er­cises; today’s en­tity list ac­tion will raise the tem­per­a­ture on the Chi­nese side dur­ing an al­ready fraught pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Dr Lu Xiang, direc­tor for re­search at the Hong Kong-based Chi­nese In­sti­tute of Hong Kong, an af­fil­i­ate of the Chi­nese Academy of So­cial Sci­ences, said that from China’s per­spec­tive, the es­ca­la­tion of ten­sions was part of the “play­book” of Mr Trump’s election cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Blam­ing China is use­ful to dis­tract from the United States ad­min­is­tra­tion’s fail­ure to man­age the Covid-19 pan­demic, he said dur­ing a pod­cast con­ver­sa­tion this week with Ms Bon­nie Glaser, se­nior ad­viser for Asia and direc­tor of the China Power Project at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Dr Lu said: “The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion… is a by-prod­uct of the do­mes­tic pol­i­tics of the US.”</p>
