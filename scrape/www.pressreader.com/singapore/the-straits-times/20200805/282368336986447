    <p>Launched in the United States in April, the sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion Google Pixel Buds true wire­less in-ear head­phones landed in Sin­ga­pore last month.</p>
    <p>Avail­able in white, the Pixel Buds (2020) looks sim­i­lar to its pre­de­ces­sor. How­ever, the ny­lon ca­ble that joins the orig­i­nal’s ear­buds is gone.</p>
    <p>A peb­ble-shaped charg­ing case is now i ncluded. It has a pair­ing but­ton on its back and a USB-C port at its bot­tom. Two charg­ing in­di­ca­tor lights – one ex­ter­nal and one in­ter­nal – let you see the charg­ing sta­tus. The charg­ing case sup­ports wire­less charg­ing.</p>
    <p>The ear­buds fea­ture a 12mm dy­namic driver each and are in­te­grated with Google As­sis­tant. They have adap­tive sound tech­nol­ogy that op­ti­mises vol­ume based on en­vi­ron­men­tal noise, au­to­mat­i­cally re­duc­ing the vol­ume when you are in a quiet room and in­creas­ing it when you are on the bus, for in­stance.</p>
    <p>The ear­buds have a round touch­sen­si­tive ex­te­rior with a Google logo and are joined to a short stem with a tiny sta­biliser ear wing and a sil­i­cone ear tip. The ear wing “an­chors” and se­cures the ear­bud to your ear.</p>
    <p>Three pairs of ear tips of dif­fer­ent sizes are in­cluded, though no ad­di­tional ear wings are pro­vided.</p>
    <p>The ear­buds’ IPX4 rat­ing means they can with­stand wa­ter splashes and sweat. Just don’t wear them when run­ning in heavy rain.</p>
    <p>As you might ex­pect, pair­ing the Pixel Buds (2020) with a Google Pixel smart­phone or an An­droid smart­phone (run­ning An­droid 6.0 and later) is a cinch.</p>
    <p>Flip up the lid of the charg­ing case with the ear­buds in­side and a win­dow will ap­pear on the smart­phone for you to tap and con­nect.</p>
    <p>Pair­ing the ear­buds with an iPhone is easy too but not as seam­less.</p>
    <p>Af­ter flip­ping up the lid, you have to hold the but­ton on its back un­til the in­ter­nal in­di­ca­tor light flashes white, then go to the iPhone’s Blue­tooth menu and se­lect Pixel Buds (2020) to com­plete the pair­ing.</p>
    <p>For non-Pixel An­droid (6.0 and later) smart­phones, you have to down­load the Pixel Buds app (avail­able for An­droid only), which al­lows you to up­date firmware, ac­ti­vate adap­tive sound and cus­tomise the touch con­trols.</p>
    <p>Not that the de­fault touch con­trol scheme needs any changes – it is in­tu­itive and easy to re­mem­ber. You tap once to play or pause a track, twice to skip a track and thrice to re­turn to the pre­vi­ous track. And you swipe for­ward to in­crease the vol­ume and back­wards to de­crease the vol­ume.</p>
    <p>I like that the con­trols are iden­ti­cal for each ear­bud, un­like some of its com­peti­tors which have dif­fer­ent func­tions as­signed to the same con­trols on the left and right ear­bud, making the con­trols hard to re­mem­ber.</p>
    <p>One down­side with the Pixel Buds (2020) is that it lacks ac­tive noise-can­cel­la­tion tech­nol­ogy. Its pas­sive noise can­cel­la­tion is unim­pres­sive as its spa­tial vents, which re­duce the “plugged-ear” feel­ing, al­low too much noise to pass through.</p>
    <p>The au­dio qual­ity is nice in it­self, but medi­ocre when com­pared with the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>While the mids and highs are clear, the bass lacks oomph. Fur­ther­more, there is no equaliser set­ting in the Pixel Buds app for you to cus­tomise the sound.</p>
    <p>The big­gest party trick of the Pixel Buds (2020) is its real-time trans­la­tion fea­ture (it works only with An­droid smart­phones), which al­lows two peo­ple to use one ear­bud each to carry out a con­ver­sa­tion in dif­fer­ent lan­guages.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this re­quires the use of the Google Trans­late app on your smart­phone. But if you have the app on your phone, why would you need the ear­buds?</p>
    <p>The app it­self can read out the trans­lated words and the ear­buds are merely con­duits for the au­dio. Not to men­tion, you have to speak slowly for the trans­la­tion to work.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is pretty good at five hours of mu­sic play­back on a full charge. The charg­ing case adds 19 more hours.</p>
