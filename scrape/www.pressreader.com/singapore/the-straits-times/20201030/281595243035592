    <p>The ways a story can be told have evolved since 1845 – when The Straits Times was founded – as have the ways read­ers now keep them­selves in­formed.</p>
    <p>To mark the pa­per’s 175th an­niver­sary, ST is launch­ing a new line-up to­day to serve read­ers even bet­ter.</p>
    <p>As the world changes, ST will bring read­ers the sto­ries that mat­ter, and in the same timely, au­thor­i­ta­tive and cred­i­ble man­ner that the pa­per has held it­self to for over a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>ST edi­tor War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is also edi­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group, noted that peo­ple are con­sum­ing news as and when they want it.</p>
    <p>“We will fol­low de­vel­op­ments as they hap­pen, and make sure we are serv­ing the news through the day, not only in words, but also through vis­ual sto­ry­telling and in­ter­ac­tive graph­ics so sto­ries will be told in an en­gag­ing man­ner,” he said.</p>
    <p>ST’s jour­nal­ists will con­tinue to bring Sin­ga­pore, the re­gion and the world to read­ers with timely up­dates and com­men­taries.</p>
    <p>The re­vamp means the pa­per will walk with its read­ers as they go through dif­fer­ent stages of their life.</p>
    <p>Those hop­ing to keep up to speed on money matters can turn to the In­vest sec­tion on Sun­days, which will now have a new mi­crosite. Read­ers can also sub­scribe to the In­vest news­let­ter.</p>
    <p>Par­ents and those en­ter­ing par­ent­hood will have a new Smart Par­ent­ing sec­tion to turn to. It ap­pears in print on Mon­days, and can be ac­cessed on­line any time on a mi­crosite.</p>
    <p>Read­ers with burn­ing ques­tions on par­ent­ing will have them an­swered in the Ask The Ex­pert video series which will be launched on Mon­day along with the mi­crosite.</p>
    <p>If you are stuck over what to do over the week­end, ST will also be there to help.</p>
    <p>Tune in to The Big Story on Thurs­days where the Life team will share tips on the best food places and fun things to do. More rec­om­men­da­tions will ap­pear in Life’s Friyay sec­tion on Fri­days.</p>
    <p>Time-starved read­ers can keep abreast of the lat­est news on ST’s web­site and app, which have both been re­vamped, too.</p>
    <p>A re­freshed lay­out on both plat­forms al­lows view­ers to see more head­lines at a glance.</p>
    <p>Read­ers who have down­loaded the re­freshed ST app would al­ready have ex­pe­ri­enced the new “Dis­cover” sec­tion.</p>
    <p>This fea­tures vis­ual sto­ries op­ti­mised for mo­bile de­vices and told through a short series of strik­ing i mages, videos and graph­ics.</p>
    <p>Those who pre­fer to sit back with the week­end pa­per and dive into long reads can turn to the new News Fo­cus sec­tion on Satur­days.</p>
    <p>The sec­tion will house ST’s Asian In­sider – where our bu­reaus will an­a­lyse the big re­gional sto­ries – and In­sight, which will fo­cus on is­sues Sin­ga­pore­ans are grap­pling with.</p>
    <p>The re­vamped Sun­day Times rounds off the pa­per’s week­end of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>A new Views seg­ment will fea­ture pieces by vet­eran jour­nal­ists like Su­miko Tan, Wong Kim Hoh and Ro­hit Bri­j­nath, as well as younger voices like Olivia Ho and a col­umn by mil­len­ni­als in the news­room.</p>
    <p>ST has also bol­stered its range of video pro­grammes, pod­casts and ra­dio shows.</p>
    <p>The Big Story con­tin­ues to stream live at 5.30pm ev­ery week­day from the news­room, over ST’s Face­book, Twit­ter and YouTube chan­nels.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme brings to­gether ex­perts and re­porter­sto dis­cuss the top sto­ries ofthe day.</p>
    <p>A new ST News Night showthat streams ev­ery week­night at 9pm will round up what’s trend­ing as well as the lat­est buzz on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Also new is Edi­tor Says, a weekly video pro­gramme aired ev­ery Fri­day at 3pm when an edi­tor will dis­cuss the top story of the week.</p>
    <p>The new line-up means ST comes to read­ers in ev­ery way they want to con­sume the news – on­line, on the app or in print.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­me­dia el­e­ments will also be tapped through­out ST’s of­fer­ings to give read­ers a multi-sen­sory ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the pa­per’s evo­lu­tion through the years,ST ex­ec­u­tive edi­tor Su­miko Tan noted that the news­pa­per has had an on­line pres­ence since 1994.</p>
    <p>“We have come a long way since then, and to­day, t he news­room is fully cross­me­dia,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Each story ap­pears on a va­ri­ety of plat­forms, and jour­nal­ists are equally at home in print, on­line, video, ra­dio and pod­cast.”</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­nan­dez added that read­ers’ feed­back has been at the cen­tre of this re­vamp, and read­ers can ex­pect more of the con­tent they want.</p>
    <p>“Amid the un­cer­tain­ties of to­day and the chal­lenges of to­mor­row, ST en­deav­ours to re­main trusted, timely and true,” he added.</p>
