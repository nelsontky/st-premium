    <p>Pri­vate ed­u­ca­tion provider Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion’s chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Chew Hua Seng has said that to his knowl­edge, there is no in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) against him, his wife or his son.</p>
    <p>This was in re­sponse to an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) req­ui­si­tion no­tice dated Aug 31 which in­cluded a pro­posed res­o­lu­tion sug­gest­ing the ex­is­tence of a pend­ing CAD com­plaint against the three in­di­vid­u­als, Mr Chew said in a state­ment on Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>The no­tice was sent by Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion share­hold­ers Oei Hong Leong, his firm Oei Hong Leong Art Mu­seum, and In­dian ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy en­tre­pre­neur Shan­tanu Prakash.</p>
    <p>They asked that a spe­cial au­di­tor be ap­pointed to re­view the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion’s joint ven­ture with Mr Prakash’s In­dia-listed Educomp So­lu­tions, amid con­cerns of wrong­do­ing, in­clud­ing al­leged forgery, cor­rup­tion and dis­clo­sure fail­ures.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, they said Mr Prakash had filed a com­plaint with the CAD, re­lat­ing to Mr Chew, his spouse Doris Chew, his son Chew Han Wei and other Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion di­rec­tors po­ten­tially hav­ing “col­luded and con­spired to fraud­u­lently fab­ri­cate and forge doc­u­ments to­wards extortion of Mr Prakash for land grab­bing in In­dia”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew noted in his state­ment on Tues­day that Mr Prakash and Educomp are be­ing probed by In­dia’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion agency for ma­jor cor­po­rate fraud, the Se­ri­ous Fraud In­ves­ti­ga­tions Of­fice.</p>
    <p>These in­ves­ti­ga­tions in In­dia re­late to al­le­ga­tions of fund di­ver­sion and land deals done at in­flated prices by Educomp.</p>
    <p>Mr Prakash is chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the edtech company.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Cen­tral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion has reg­is­tered a crim­i­nal case against Educomp, Mr Prakash, a guar­an­tor and for­mer di­rec­tors for of­fences un­der the Pre­ven­tion of Cor­rup­tion Act, as well as for con­spir­acy, cheat­ing and forgery, as they al­legedly de­frauded a con­sor­tium of banks of about 19.55 bil­lion ru­pees (S$364.3 mil­lion), ac­cord­ing to lo­cal media re­ports.</p>
    <p>In Mr Chew’s state­ment, he said he found it “cu­ri­ous” that Mr Oei aligned him­self with Mr Prakash for the lat­est EGM req­ui­si­tion de­spite Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion hav­ing won ar­bi­tra­tion pro­ceed­ings against Educomp and hav­ing ini­ti­ated a law­suit against the In­dian busi­ness­man and an­other party.</p>
    <p>Shares of Sin­ga­pore main­board-listed Raf­fles Ed­u­ca­tion slid 1.74 per cent to close at 11 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
