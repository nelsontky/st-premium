    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) has is­sued a let­ter of de­mand to lawyer M. Ravi to apol­o­gise and re­tract com­ments he had made about a case in­volv­ing a drug run­ner who es­caped the gal­lows.</p>
    <p>In a video in­ter­view with al­ter­na­tive news site The On­line Cit­i­zen (TOC) on Mon­day, Mr Ravi had made “false and highly in­flam­ma­tory” al­le­ga­tions against the pros­e­cu­tion in the case, the AGC said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His com­ments came af­ter the five­judge Court of Ap­peal on Mon­day re­versed a 2018 de­ci­sion to con­vict</p>
    <p>Gobi Ave­dian on a cap­i­tal charge.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi had told TOC the pros­e­cu­tor had been “overzeal­ous” in pros­e­cut­ing Gobi, which had “led to the death sen­tence” for his client.</p>
    <p>He also said “it was trou­bling” that the pros­e­cu­tion ran dif­fer­ent cases be­fore the High Court and the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi called on the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor and oth­ers to apol­o­gise to Gobi for the suf­fer­ing he ex­pe­ri­enced and added that the apex court’s judg­ment calls into ques­tion “the fair­ness of the ad­min­is­tra­tion of jus­tice in Gobi’s case by the pros­e­cu­tion”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the AGC said in a state­ment that it had sent Mr Ravi a let­ter ear­lier in the day de­mand­ing that he apol­o­gise and un­con­di­tion­ally re­tract the al­le­ga­tions he had made.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are se­ri­ous al­le­ga­tions, that the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor has acted in bad faith or ma­li­ciously in the pros­e­cu­tion of the ap­pli­cant (Gobi),” the AGC said.</p>
    <p>“They are false and highly in­flam­ma­tory. It is highly im­proper and en­tirely con­trary to Mr Ravi’s obli­ga­tions as an of­fi­cer of the court for him to make th­ese un­founded, base­less and mis­lead­ing al­le­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>The AGC noted that the Court of Ap­peal made no ad­verse find­ings against the Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor or the pros­e­cu­tion of Gobi.</p>
    <p>“In fact, the Court of Ap­peal pointed out in the judg­ment that the ini­tial de­ci­sion to con­vict the ap­pli­cant was ‘cor­rect at the time (it was) made’ and that none of the ar­gu­ments con­sid­ered in the judg­ment ‘could have been made in view of the le­gal po­si­tion as it was un­der­stood then’.”</p>
    <p>The AGC fur­ther said the apex court in its judg­ment had ex­plic­itly high­lighted that at the time of the trial, the court that made the ini­tial de­ci­sion did not have the ben­e­fit of the guid­ance set out in a sub­se­quent case in­volv­ing Nige­rian Adili Chibuike Ejike, who sim­i­larly es­caped the gal­lows af­ter he was cleared of drug im­por­ta­tion charges last year.</p>
    <p>The AGC has given Mr Ravi un­til noon to­mor­row to re­spond.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi posted the let­ter of de­mand on his Face­book page yes­ter­day, adding that he had taken in­struc­tions from his client and will start pro­ceed­ings against At­tor­neyGen­eral Lu­cien Wong, Deputy A-G Hri Ku­mar Nair and Se­nior Coun­sel Mo­hamed Faizal Mo­hamed Ab­dul Kadir, an AGC deputy chief pros­e­cu­tor who led the pros­e­cu­tion’s case.</p>
    <p>“I will file the writ of sum­mons in the next few days, both per­son­ally against all three of the above gov­ern­ment lawyers and also against their of­fices in which they hold pub­lic ap­point­ment,” Mr Ravi wrote in his post.</p>
    <p>“They have to be ac­count­able to Gobi and his fam­ily in court and be sub­ject to rig­or­ous cross ex­am­i­na­tion and scru­tiny of their con­duct of Gobi’s case.”</p>
    <p>He added that he would re­spond to the let­ter of de­mand ac­cord­ingly and start pro­ceed­ings against the Law So­ci­ety “if it does not do its part to pro­tect lawyers and the in­de­pen­dence of the pro­fes­sion, if it en­ter­tains any fur­ther com­plaints (or) par­tic­i­pates in any ha­rass­ment by the A-G”.</p>
