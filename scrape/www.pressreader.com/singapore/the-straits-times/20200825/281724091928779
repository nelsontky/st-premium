    <p>PRO­TECT­ING LIVELI­HOODS A PRI­OR­ITY</p>
    <p>One of the very im­por­tant ar­eas to the Min­istry of Man­power is how we can con­tinue to pro­tect the liveli­hoods of Sin­ga­pore­ans and en­sure that as many of them as pos­si­ble can stay in work. And for those who un­for­tu­nately are dis­placed be­cause their com­pa­nies have not been able to con­tinue re­tain­ing their ser­vices, then our pri­or­ity must be to help them to move on to other mean­ing­ful em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>(It) may in­volve a tran­si­tion to a new oc­cu­pa­tion, or in another in­dus­try. It may in­volve, for the time be­ing, tak­ing up trainee­ships or at­tach­ments that are hosted by com­pa­nies. And it may also in­volve tak­ing ad­van­tage of this time to boost their skills.</p>
    <p>MRS JOSEPHINE TEO, Min­is­ter for Man­power and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>BROAD­EN­ING MER­I­TOC­RACY</p>
    <p>What stuck to me was the Pres­i­dent’s point about the def­i­ni­tion of mer­i­toc­racy. I was speak­ing to some young peo­ple who felt very strongly that we should start look­ing (at) and re­defin­ing what we mean by mer­i­toc­racy, be­cause dur­ing my gen­er­a­tion all of us started from the same base. And so we knew what mer­i­toc­racy was – you work hard.</p>
    <p>But there are a lot of com­ments from young peo­ple that say that Sin­ga­pore­ans to­day come from dif­fer­ent back­grounds and they start from dif­fer­ent start­ing points, and it’s good for us to look at mer­i­toc­racy not just (in terms of) aca­demic ex­cel­lence, but also the di­ver­sity of tal­ents that Sin­ga­pore­ans can come with when­ever we’re look­ing out for tal­ent to be placed into dif­fer­ent roles in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>DR MA­LIKI OS­MAN, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion and For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING FOR­WARD TO RO­BUST DE­BATES</p>
    <p>This is the largest Par­lia­ment, with 12 rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the op­po­si­tion and 28 fe­male law­mak­ers – the largest num­ber and pro­por­tion in in­de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory. I look for­ward to di­verse per­spec­tives, ro­bust de­bates and well-con­sid­ered poli­cies for the fu­ture of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally, I stand fully com­mit­ted to rep­re­sent the voices and in­ter­est of Sin­ga­pore­ans and work with fel­low par­lia­men­tar­i­ans to re­alise our com­mon vi­sion of a stronger and in­clu­sive Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>MR SHAWN HUANG (Jurong GRC), who is a first-term MP.</p>
    <p>EX­CITED ABOUT NEXT PHASE OF NA­TION-BUILD­ING</p>
    <p>I am in agree­ment with many of the points, es­pe­cially on so­cial mo­bil­ity and ed­u­ca­tion, the need for us to con­tin­u­ally relook poli­cies to en­sure mul­ti­ple path­ways and op­por­tu­ni­ties re­gard­less of start­ing point. The fact that she touched on early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing fur­ther mo­ti­vated me.</p>
    <p>I am ex­cited for the next phase of na­tion-build­ing – the Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment. It is im­por­tant that we recog­nise the var­i­ous as­pi­ra­tions, cre­ativ­ity and di­ver­sity of views and ideas so that we can pro­pel Sin­ga­pore for­ward, to­gether.</p>
