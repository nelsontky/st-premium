    <p>AM­S­TER­DAM Nether­lands coach Frank de Boer ques­tioned the need for in­ter­na­tional friendlies in an al­ready con­gested cal­en­dar af­ter los­ing two play­ers to in­juries in his side’s 1-1 draw at home to Spain on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Cen­tre-back Nathan Ake was taken off early with a mus­cle in­jury and will miss the Nether­lands’ Na­tions League dou­ble header with Bos­nia and Poland.</p>
    <p>Right-back Hans Hate­boer was also brought off at half-time af­ter clash­ing heads with Spain’s Jose Gaya, who had to be taken off im­me­di­ately for Luis En­rique’s side.</p>
    <p>Spain’s Ser­gio Canales opened the scor­ing in the 18th minute, be­fore Donny van de Beek equalised for the home side.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think this game needed to be played,” said de Boer, who has gone four matches with­out a win since his ap­point­ment in Septem­ber. “Money is very im­por­tant but we also need to look af­ter our play­ers. All in­ter­ested par­ties need to sit down and talk be­cause the health of our play­ers is im­por­tant. De­ci­sions need to be made.”</p>
    <p>With Euro­pean do­mes­tic sea­sons start­ing a month later than usual due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, in­ter­na­tional sides have been play­ing three matches in­stead of the usual two within two weeks. Clubs are also un­der greater strain due to the short­ened sea­son, with sides in the Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League forced to play three Euro­pean fix­tures in three weeks.</p>
    <p>De Boer’s crit­i­cism at the fix­ture pile-up comes af­ter Liver­pool de­fender Joe Gomez suf­fered a knee in­jury train­ing with Eng­land on Wed­nes­day ahead of a friendly with Ire­land, prompt­ing coach Gareth South­gate to speak out on the de­mands placed on play­ers.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Ger­many earned a 1-0 vic­tory over the Czech Repub­lic in a friendly but failed to im­press as they pre­pare to face Ukraine to­mor­row and Spain on Tues­day in the Na­tions League.</p>
    <p>Joachim Low’s side se­cured the win when Philipp Max cut back for Luca Wald­schmidt to tap in af­ter 13 min­utes.</p>
