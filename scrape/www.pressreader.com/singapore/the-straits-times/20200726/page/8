        Top of theNews | | A8 The Sunday Times Sunday, July 26, 2020 Vietnam Country vigilant after first local infection in 3 months • Vietnam was back on high alert for the coronaviru­s yesterday after medical officials in the central city of Danang detected the country’s first locally transmitte­d case in three months.
Vietnam has imposed strict quarantine measures and carried out an aggressive and widespread testing programme during the pandemic, keeping its total tally of reported infections to just 417, with no deaths.
It had reported no locally transmitte­d infections for 100 days until Friday, when the Health Ministry said a 57-year-old man from Danang, a tourist hot spot, had tested positive.
State media reported late yesterday that the man was in critical condition, and medical specialist­s had flown from Ho Chi Minh City to Danang to treat him.
The authoritie­s said 50 people the patient came into contact with have been isolated. The ministry said 103 people connected to the patient were tested for the virus but all returned negative results.
It said that more than 11,800 people are being quarantine­d throughout the country, including 147 at hospitals.
The government did not say how the man contracted the virus but said he had not left Danang for nearly a month. He was initially diagnosed with pneumonia. A fresh test yesterday had confirmed the coronaviru­s infection, the authoritie­s said.
The case comes at a time when Vietnam was about to resume internatio­nal commercial flights and as domestic tourism is surging.
Late on Friday, the authoritie­s in the capital, Hanoi, reinstated a recommenda­tion to wear masks in public places.
Vietnam’s ban on internatio­nal commercial flights is still in place, but foreign experts and skilled workers have been able to enter provided they undergo mandatory quarantine.
Of the nearly 150 cases reported over the past three months, all were found in people who had been quarantine­d on arrival. HANOI Highest single-day increase in infections since end-March • South Korea reported 113 cases of the coronaviru­s yesterday, the largest one-day increase in almost four months, and officials warned the upward trajectory could continue as affected people enter the country from abroad.
More than three-quarters of the latest reported infections were im- carrying 293 workers who were evacuated as cases swelled in that country.
Dr Kwon said yesterday that 71 of those people were infected with Covid-19 and a further 11 people were being reexamined.
“It’s likely that there will be similar cases like this Iraq case any- where in the world, and (South Korea) will repeat the same measure, so we urge people to factor that in when looking at figures of the confirmed cases,” Dr Kwon said.
A large number of crew members on a Russian ship have also tested positive, added Dr Kwon. ported, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
“Every day, we feel a sense of crisis that Covid-19 pandemic may have not yet peaked,” KCDC deputy director Kwon Jun-wook said.
South Korea has reported 14,092 cases and 298 deaths from the pandemic. Yesterday’s 113 infections were the highest since March 31.
Around 16 per cent of all the country’s infections have been imported, with around 70 per cent of those involving Korean nationals.
Two South Korean military aircraft arrived from Iraq on Friday, SEOUL REUTERS Malaysia Health protocols to be tightened as new daily cases spike REUTERS Vietnam has imposed strict quarantine measures and carried out an aggressive and widespread testing programme during the pandemic, keeping its total tally of reported infections to just 417, with no deaths. • The Malaysian government will tighten its health protocols again following the resurgence of new coronaviru­s cases in the past week after lockdown procedures were relaxed, said Senior Minister Ismail Sabri Yaacob yesterday.
The country is into what it calls the Recovery Movement Control Order (MCO), with most businesses allowed to operate if they follow health measures such as recording the temperatur­es of those entering malls, offices and shops.
A decision will be made today over what measures would be adopted by the government as standard operating procedures (SOP), Datuk Seri Ismail told a media briefing, as quoted by Bernama news agency. “The technical committee will meet on Sunday to work on the finer details of the SOP and table it at the ministeria­l meeting on Monday,” he said.
Malaysia implemente­d the MCO on March 18, locking down much of the country for more than three months as it tried to reduce the number of new daily cases, especially after a super-spreader event involving a mass gathering by the Tabligh missionary group at a mosque in Kuala Lumpur.
During the MCO, most people were allowed to leave their homes only to buy groceries, food or medicine, and only essential work- KUALA LUMPUR ers such as hospital and supermarke­t workers were allowed to leave their homes daily.
Some businesses were allowed to reopen from May 4 under what it called the Conditiona­l MCO, as new cases began to taper.
From June 10, under the Recovery MCO, almost all social, educationa­l, religious, business and economic sectors were allowed to resume operations in stages.
Travel between Malaysia’s 13 states was also allowed to resume.
However, new daily cases have been on the rise again, especially in the past week.
The authoritie­s from Friday resumed placing those who returned from abroad in government-designated quarantine centres including hotels for 14 days, amid several known cases of breaches by those told to self-quarantine at home.
A total of 23 new Covid-19 cases were reported yesterday, against 21 on Friday, nine on Thursday, and 16 on Wednesday.
The cumulative tally of infections stands at 8,884. There were no new fatalities, with the death toll remaining at 123.
The Health Ministry had announced on July 1 that the country had recorded zero cases of local transmissi­ons for the first time since March, and had only one new case that was imported.
