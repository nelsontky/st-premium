    <p>US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den is poised to un­leash a se­ries of ex­ec­u­tive ac­tions on his first day in of­fice, prompt­ing what is likely to be a years­long ef­fort to un­wind Mr Don­ald Trump’s do­mes­tic agenda.</p>
    <p>In the first hours af­ter he takes the oath of of­fice on the West Front of the Capi­tol at noon on Jan 20, Mr Bi­den has said, he will send a let­ter to the United Na­tions in­di­cat­ing that the United States will rejoin the global ef­fort to com­bat cli­mate change, re­vers­ing Mr Trump’s move to with­draw from the Paris cli­mate ac­cord.</p>
    <p>He has also vowed that on Day 1 he will move rapidly to con­front the coro­n­avirus pan­demic by ap­point­ing a “national sup­ply chain com­man­der” and es­tab­lish­ing a “pan­demic test­ing board”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has also said he will re­store the rights of gov­ern­ment work­ers to unionise. He has promised to or­der a new fight against home­less­ness and re­set­tle more refugees flee­ing war. And he has pledged to aban­don Mr Trump’s travel ban on mostly Mus­lim coun­tries and to be­gin call­ing for­eign lead­ers in an at­tempt to re­store trust among the US’ clos­est al­lies.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery pres­i­dent wants to come out of the gate strong and start ful­fill­ing cam­paign prom­ises be­fore lunch on the first day,” said Mr Dan Pfeif­fer, who was a se­nior ad­viser to pres­i­dent Barack Obama and helped chore­o­graph Mr Obama’s first days i n the White House. “Ex­ec­u­tive or­ders are the best way to do that.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Bi­den, who won the elec­tion in a deeply di­vided na­tion, the early sig­nals he sends as the US’ new leader will be crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>He has re­peat­edly said he was cam­paign­ing as a Demo­crat but would gov­ern “as an Amer­i­can”.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing through on that prom­ise will re­quire Mr Bi­den to demon­strate some re­spect for parts of the Trump agenda that were fiercely sup­ported by the more than 70 mil­lion peo­ple who did not vote for the Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>“If you want to show that you want to work on a bi­par­ti­san ba­sis, then you don’t go out right away and sign all the ex­ec­u­tive or­ders on im­mi­gra­tion and by­pass Congress,” for­mer Repub­li­can se­na­tor Rick San­to­rum told CNN last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that Mr Bi­den and his party mem­bers are ea­ger to sys­tem­at­i­cally erase what they view as destruc­tive poli­cies that Mr Trump pur­sued on many is­sues, in­clud­ing the en­vi­ron­ment, im­mi­gra­tion, health­care, gay rights, trade, tax cuts, civil rights, abor­tion, race re­la­tions and mil­i­tary spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Some of that will re­quire co­op­er­a­tion with Congress, which may re­main di­vided next year.</p>
    <p>If Repub­li­cans main­tain con­trol of the Se­nate, Mr Bi­den’s pledges to roll back some of Mr Trump’s tax cuts are al­most cer­tain to run into fierce op­po­si­tion. And his ef­forts to shape the new gov­ern­ment with ap­point­ments could be con­strained by the need to win ap­proval in a Repub­li­can Se­nate.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den may be able to achieve some of his goals with just the stroke of a pen.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump largely failed to suc­cess­fully ne­go­ti­ate with House Democrats dur­ing his four years in of­fice, leav­ing him no choice but to use ex­ec­u­tive ac­tions to ad­vance his agenda.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den can use the same tools to re­verse them.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect has sig­nalled that his top pri­or­ity will be demon­strat­ing a much more mus­cu­lar fed­eral ap­proach to the pan­demic than Mr Trump’s leave-itto-the-states strat­egy.</p>
    <p>He was set to an­nounce a Covid-19 task force yes­ter­day, com­posed largely of doc­tors and pub­lic health ex­perts. And aides have said he would use the power of his of­fice to in­voke the De­fence Pro­duc­tion Act, which will al­low him to or­der com­pa­nies to man­u­fac­ture prod­ucts nec­es­sary for national de­fence – to build up sup­plies more ag­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>While Mr Bi­den would like to see a national mask man­date, his ad­vis­ers say he does not have the le­gal au­thor­ity to im­pose one. So he will try to in­crease mask wear­ing in other ways.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready said that, as pres­i­dent, he would re­quire masks on all fed­eral prop­erty, an ex­ec­u­tive or­der that is likely to come in the first hours or days of his pres­i­dency. He has also said he would re­quire them on “all in­ter­state trans­porta­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has also re­peat­edly de­rided Mr Trump’s lack of eth­i­cal stan­dards. The Pres­i­dent-elect’s re­sponse to that will prob­a­bly take the form of an ethics pledge to im­pose tough new re­quire­ments on the peo­ple who serve in his gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has shred­ded those stan­dards,” Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign wrote on his web­site. “On Day 1, Bi­den will is­sue an ethics pledge, build­ing and im­prov­ing on the Obama-Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pledge, to en­sure that ev­ery mem­ber of his ad­min­is­tra­tion fo­cuses... on the best out­comes for the Amer­i­can peo­ple, and noth­ing else.”</p>
