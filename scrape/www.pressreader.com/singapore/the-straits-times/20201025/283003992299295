    <p>Lately, I have been putting an em­bar­rass­ing amount of thought into no­tions like jinxes and knock­ing on wood. The polls for US Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den look good, but this year, any hint of op­ti­mism feels dan­ger­ously naive, and my brain has been work­ing over­time in search of po­ten­tial doom.</p>
    <p>I have be­come con­sumed with an alarm­ing pos­si­bil­ity: that nei­ther the polls nor the ac­tual out­come of the elec­tion re­ally mat­ters, be­cause to a great many Amer­i­cans, dig­i­tal com­mu­ni­ca­tion has al­ready ren­dered em­pir­i­cal, ob­serv­able re­al­ity be­side the point.</p>
    <p>If I sound jumpy, it’s be­cause I spent a cou­ple of hours re­cently chat­ting with Dr Joan Dono­van, the research di­rec­tor of the Shoren­stein Cen­tre on Me­dia, Pol­i­tics and Pub­lic Pol­icy at Har­vard’s Kennedy School. She is a pi­o­neer­ing scholar of mis­in­for­ma­tion and me­dia ma­nip­u­la­tion – the way that ac­tivists, ex­trem­ists and pro­pa­gan­dists surf cur­rents in our frag­mented, poorly mod­er­ated me­dia ecosys­tem to gain at­ten­tion and in­flu­ence so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Dr Dono­van’s research team stud­ies on­line lies the way crash-scene in­ves­ti­ga­tors study avi­a­tion dis­as­ters. They metic­u­lously take apart spe­cific hoaxes, con­spir­acy the­o­ries, vi­ral po­lit­i­cal memes, ha­rass­ment cam­paigns and other toxic on­line cam­paigns in search of the tac­tics that made each one ex­plode into the pub­lic con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Last week, Dr Dono­van’s team pub­lished The Me­dia Ma­nip­u­la­tion Case­book, a search­able on­line data­base of their research. It makes for grim read­ing – an ac­count­ing of the many fail­ures of jour­nal­ists, me­dia com­pa­nies, tech firms, pol­i­cy­mak­ers, law en­force­ment of­fi­cials and the na­tional se­cu­rity es­tab­lish­ment to an­tic­i­pate and coun­ter­act the liars who seek to dupe us. Armed with th­ese in­ves­ti­ga­tions, Dr Dono­van hopes we can all do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>I hope she’s right. But study­ing her work also got me won­der­ing whether we’re too late. Many Amer­i­cans have be­come so deeply dis­trust­ful of one an­other that what­ever hap­pens on Nov 3, they may refuse to ac­cept the out­come. Every day I grow more fear­ful that the num­ber of those Amer­i­cans will be large enough to im­peril our na­tion’s ca­pac­ity to func­tion as a co­he­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“I’m wor­ried about po­lit­i­cal vi­o­lence,” Dr Dono­van told me. Amer­ica is heav­ily armed, and from Port­land to Kenosha to the Michi­gan gov­er­nor’s man­sion, we have seen young men rad­i­calised and or­gan­ised on­line be­gin­ning to take the law into their own hands.</p>
    <p>Dr Dono­van told me she fears that “peo­ple who are armed are go­ing to be­come dan­ger­ous, be­cause they see no other way out”.</p>
    <p>Me­dia ma­nip­u­la­tion is a fairly novel area of research. It was only when Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump won the White House by hit­ting it big with right-wing on­line sub­cul­tures – and af­ter In­ter­net-mo­bilised au­thor­i­tar­i­ans around the world pulled sim­i­lar tricks – that se­ri­ous schol­ars be­gan to take no­tice. The research has made a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>In the 2016 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, technology firms and the main­stream me­dia were of­ten blind to the ways that right-wing groups, in­clud­ing white su­prem­a­cists, were us­ing bots, memes and other tricks of so­cial me­dia to “hack” the pub­lic’s at­ten­tion, as the re­searchers Al­ice Marwick and Re­becca Lewis doc­u­mented in 2017.</p>
    <p>But the war since has been one of at­tri­tion. Pro­pa­gan­dists keep dis­cov­er­ing new ways to spread mis­in­for­ma­tion; re­searchers like Dr Dono­van and her col­leagues keep suss­ing them out, and, usu­ally quite late, me­dia and tech firms move to fix the flaws – by which time the bad guys have moved on to some other way of spread­ing un­truths.</p>
    <p>While the me­dia ecosys­tem has wised up in some ways: Note how the story sup­pos­edly re­veal­ing the con­tents of Mr Hunter Bi­den’s lap­top landed with a splat re­cently, quite dif­fer­ent from the breath­lessly ir­re­spon­si­ble re­port­ing on the Democrats’ hacked e-mails in 2016. But our so­ci­ety re­mains pro­foundly sus­cep­ti­ble to men­dac­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Dono­van wor­ries about two fac­tors in par­tic­u­lar. One is the so­cial iso­la­tion caused by the pandemic. Lots of Amer­i­cans are stuck at home, many eco­nom­i­cally bereft and cut off from friends and rel­a­tives who might tem­per their pas­sions – a per­fect au­di­ence for ped­dlers of con­spir­acy the­o­ries.</p>
    <p>Her other ma­jor worry is the con­spir­acy lol­la­palooza known as QAnon. It’s of­ten short-handed – the way NBC jour­nal­ist Sa­van­nah Guthrie did at her town hall take­down of the Pres­i­dent re­cently – as a nutty con­spir­acy the­ory in which a heroic Mr Trump is prosecutin­g a secret war against a sa­tanic pae­dophile ring of lefty elites. But that un­der­sells QAnon’s dan­ger. To peo­ple who have been “Q-pilled”, QAnon plays a much deeper role in their lives; it has el­e­ments of a sup­port group, a po­lit­i­cal party, a life­style brand, a col­lec­tive delu­sion, a re­li­gion, a cult, a huge mul­ti­player game and an ex­trem­ist network.</p>
    <p>Dr Dono­van thinks QAnon rep­re­sents a new, flex­i­ble in­fra­struc­ture for con­spir­acy. QAnon has ori­gins in a tin­foil-hat story about a Wash­ing­ton, DC-area pizza shop, but over the years it has adapted to in­clude the­o­ries about the “deep state” and the Mueller probe, Jef­frey Ep­stein and a wild va­ri­ety of mis­in­for­ma­tion about face masks, mir­a­cle cures and other hoaxes re­gard­ing Covid-19. QAnon has been linked to many in­stances of vi­o­lence, and law en­force­ment and ter­ror­ism re­searchers dis­cuss it as a grow­ing se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>“We now have a densely net­worked con­spir­acy the­ory that is ex­tend­able, adapt­able, flex­i­ble and re­silient to take down,” Dr Dono­van said of QAnon. It’s a very In­ter­net story, anal­o­gous to the way Ama­zon ex­panded from an on­line book­store into a gen­eral-pur­pose system for sell­ing any­thing to any­one.</p>
    <p>Face­book and YouTube this month launched new ef­forts to take down QAnon con­tent, but Q-ad­her­ents have of­ten man­aged to evade de-plat­form­ing by soft­en­ing and read­just­ing their mes­sages.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, for in­stance, QAnon has adopted slo­gans like “Save the Chil­dren” and “Child Lives Mat­ter”, and it seems to be ap­peal­ing to anti-vaxxers and well­ness mums.</p>
    <p>QAnon is also par­tic­i­pa­tory, and, in an un­cer­tain time, it may seem like a sal­va­tion. Peo­ple “are seek­ing an­swers and they’re find­ing a very re­cep­tive com­mu­nity in QAnon”, Dr Dono­van said. This is a com­mon theme in dis­in­for­ma­tion research: What makes dig­i­tal lies so dif­fi­cult to com­bat is not just the tech used to spread them, but also the na­ture of the so­ci­eties they’re tar­get­ing, in­clud­ing their po­lit­i­cal cul­tures.</p>
    <p>Dr Dono­van com­pares QAnon to the Rev­erend Charles Coughlin, the priest whose ra­dio show spread anti-Semitism in the De­pres­sion-era United States. Stop­ping Fa­ther Coughlin’s hate took a con­certed ef­fort, in­volv­ing new reg­u­la­tions for ra­dio broad­cast­ers and con­dem­na­tion of him by the Catholic Church. Stop­ping QAnon will be harder; Fa­ther Coughlin was one hate­mon­ger with a big mi­cro­phone, while QAnon is a com­plex, de­cen­tralised, de­cep­tive network of hate. But the prin­ci­ple re­mains: Com­bat­ing the de­cep­tion that has over­run pub­lic dis­course should be a pri­mary goal of our so­ci­ety. Oth­er­wise, Amer­ica ends in lies.</p>
