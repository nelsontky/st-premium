    <p>LONDON • Gareth South­gate said Tammy Abra­ham, Ben Chilwell and Jadon San­cho face a bat­tle to win their spots back, af­ter the Eng­land man­ager was im­pressed by the ex­per­i­men­tal side he fielded in Thurs­day’s 3-0 win over Wales.</p>
    <p>The trio missed the friendly at Wem­b­ley af­ter they breached Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions at the week­end. In their ab­sence, Ever­ton for­ward Do­minic Calvert-Lewin, Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers de­fender Conor Coady and Southamp­ton striker Danny Ings scored their first in­ter­na­tional goals, while As­ton Villa’s Jack Gre­al­ish and Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka also im­pressed on their first Eng­land starts.</p>
    <p>“That is the re­ally big les­son for any­body in that sit­u­a­tion, re­ally,” South­gate said. “You want to be in­volved, you want to be play­ing.</p>
    <p>“When you have got the shirt, or a place in the squad, you don’t want to al­low other peo­ple the op­por­tu­nity to take it. When­ever we give de­buts... there is an op­por­tu­nity for them to push them­selves up the peck­ing or­der. Sev­eral did that.”</p>
    <p>With Coady at the heart of de­fence, Eng­land played with a 3-4-2-1 for­ma­tion as Calvert-Lewin, Ings and Gre­al­ish led the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Calvert-Lewin, who has scored nine goals in six games for Ever­ton this sea­son, net­ted in the 26th minute with his first shot be­fore Coady and Ings se­cured the win in the warm-up game for Na­tions League matches against Bel­gium to­mor­row and Den­mark on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It was the first time three play­ers have scored their first Eng­land goals in the same game since June 1963 against Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>South­gate had warned the per­for­mance was not “go­ing to be per­fect” mainly be­cause of his play­ers’ lack of fa­mil­iar­ity with each other.</p>
    <p>There were only 54 caps be­tween them at kick-off. Michael Keane, Joe Gomez and the stand-in cap­tain, Kieran Trip­pier, had 41 of those.</p>
    <p>But Calvert-Lewin was the bright spark. Apart from his goal, there was also the dart on to an Ings pass that en­abled him to go round Wales ’keeper Wayne Hen­nessey – only to find the an­gle was too acute.</p>
    <p>Gre­al­ish, who scored a brace in last week­end’s 7-2 win over Liver­pool, snuffed out spa­ces and drove the team on with the ball at his feet.</p>
    <p>South­gate will be pleased that he is able to play with a back three like they did, or re­vert to a back four.</p>
    <p>Up front, they could de­ploy an at­tack re­volv­ing around the cre­ativ­ity of Gre­al­ish, or they could play Harry Kane along­side the blis­ter­ing pace of Mar­cus Rash­ford, Ra­heem Ster­ling and San­cho.</p>
    <p>“I thought the play­ers did very well,” South­gate said. “It’s so dif­fi­cult for a new team to come to­gether with­out much ex­pe­ri­ence, it was not fluid at the start but we got more and more into the game, and I thought we fin­ished strongly.”</p>
