    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia does not know why China has de­tained Aus­tralian cit­i­zen and tele­vi­sion an­chor Cheng Lei, Trade Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian govern­ment con­firmed on Mon­day even­ing that Ms Cheng, a high-pro­file busi­ness an­chor on Chi­nese state tele­vi­sion, was de­tained two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>“Cheng Lei is an Aus­tralian, a jour­nal­ist who has been work­ing in China for some pe­riod of time,” Mr Birm­ing­ham told ABC Ra­dio.</p>
    <p>He added: “I feel for her fam­ily very much at this point in time, and it’s why we will do what we can to as­sist her, as we would and have any Aus­tralian in these sorts of cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng hosted a busi­ness show on the English chan­nel of China’s largest state me­dia broad­caster CCTV, and was a high-pro­file an­chor on its English-lan­guage chan­nel CGTN. But videos of her have been re­moved from Chi­nese state me­dia sites, Reuters found.</p>
    <p>Friends of Ms Cheng told Reuters they no­ticed the videos were taken down two weeks ago, and they be­came con­cerned when they were un­able to con­tact her.</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng reg­u­larly hosted Aus­tralian busi­ness fo­rums and events in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry de­clined to com­ment on the specifics of Ms Cheng’s case at a reg­u­lar brief­ing yes­ter­day, but said China will act in ac­cor­dance with the law.</p>
    <p>“We value China-Aus­tralia re­la­tions but, at the same time, the devel­op­ment of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions re­quires the j oint ef­forts of both sides,” said For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing, in re­sponse to a ques­tion about whether the case was linked to Ms Cheng’s na­tion­al­ity and re­cent is­sues in the Sino-Aus­tralian re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Em­bassy was given con­sular ac­cess to Ms Cheng via video link last Thurs­day, Mr Birm­ing­ham said.</p>
    <p>She has two chil­dren, both in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne told lo­cal ra­dio yes­ter­day af­ter­noon that Can­berra has sought i nfor­ma­tion on why Ms Cheng was de­tained.</p>
