    <p>BANGKOK • Thailand con­firmed 46 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, of which 39 were lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases found in 17 dif­fer­ent prov­inces.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing seven cases were im­ported, Mr Taweesin Wisanuyoth­in, a spokesman for the coun­try’s Covid-19 task­force, told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>There were no re­ports of new in­fec­tions among mi­grant work­ers linked to the south-west prov­ince of Samut Sakhon, where Thailand’s worst Covid-19 out­break yet was con­firmed over the week­end.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha urged all Thais to join forces to over­come the lat­est out­break, and hinted at fur­ther dis­ease con­trols.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the na­tion in a tele­vised ap­pear­ance, the Premier said the out­break in Samut Sakhon – which has so far spawned over 1,000 cases – had been tack­led with strin­gent mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut said the virus cri­sis, which is grow­ing around the world, will fur­ther hurt global eco­nomic re­cov­ery and in turn af­fect the coun­try’s eco­nomic re­vival.</p>
    <p>The global sit­u­a­tion also meant that Thailand would have to main­tain en­try restrictio­ns for for­eign trav­ellers, to curb the trans­mis­sion of the deadly dis­ease, he said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties will keep a close watch on air­ports and other ac­cess points in­clud­ing trains, buses, boats and nat­u­ral bor­der cross­ings, Mr Prayut said.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional strin­gent mea­sures might be needed to han­dle the sit­u­a­tion, he said. Planned New Year events may also face ex­tra con­trols or even can­cel­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Gangs that traf­ficked mi­grant work­ers must be erad­i­cated, re­gard­less of whether state of­fi­cials were in­volved, he added.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter also vowed to do his best to de­liver vac­cines for all Thais.</p>
