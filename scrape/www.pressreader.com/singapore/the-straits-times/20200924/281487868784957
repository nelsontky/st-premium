    <p>The Sin­ga­pore police have launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion i nto Novena Global Health­care Group, which is owned by Sin­ga­porean cousins Ter­ence and Nel­son Loh, for al­legedly us­ing unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of an ac­count­ing firm on its fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>A police spokesman told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that they can­not give fur­ther de­tails as “it is in­ap­pro­pri­ate to com­ment on on­go­ing police in­ves­ti­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the group’s co-founder Ter­ence Loh, 42, gave a state­ment to the police yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The police had also vis­ited his Sen­tosa Cove con­do­minium apart­ment.</p>
    <p>It is not known if Mr Nel­son Loh, 40, who co-founded the com­pany, has also given his state­ment, but sources with knowl­edge of the case say he has not been con­tactable.</p>
    <p>An em­ployee of Novena Global Health­care told ST last week that the Loh cousins have not been to the of­fice, lo­cated at Novena Gar­dens, for more than a week.</p>
    <p>Last week, ST re­ported that ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young (EY) had made a police re­port re­gard­ing al­legedly unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of the firm on some fi­nan­cial state­ments of Novena Global Health­care Group.</p>
    <p>EY said that it did not sign off on the fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing through his lawyer last week, Mr Ter­ence Loh de­nied any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>The two men and their Chi­nese busi­ness part­ner Evan­ge­line Shen, 32, made the news last month for their £280 mil­lion (S$489 mil­lion) takeover bid for English Pre­mier League club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>The Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Acra) said last month that it would be tak­ing enforcemen­t ac­tion against two com­pa­nies owned by the Lohs – Novena Global Health­care and</p>
    <p>Novena Life Sciences – for fail­ing to file the an­nual re­turns due on July 29, 2018 and Dec 9 last year, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Health­care, which was in­cor­po­rated in Sin­ga­pore in 2016, is a sub­sidiary of Novena Global Health­care Group, which was in­cor­po­rated in the Cayman Is­lands.</p>
    <p>The firms are among at least two dozen en­ti­ties linked to the cousins.</p>
    <p>An Acra search by ST yes­ter­day showed that Citibank reg­is­tered charges on Novena Ap­tus and Novena No­vap­tus on Feb 24 this year, a month af­ter the two com­pa­nies were in­cor­po­rated by the Loh cousins.</p>
    <p>A charge is a form of se­cu­rity in­ter­est usu­ally taken by a lender or cred­i­tor – “chargee” – to se­cure re­pay­ment of a loan.</p>
    <p>Sources with knowl­edge of the loans said that Citibank lent the Loh cousins sev­eral mil­lion dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Citibank de­clined com­ment. It was pre­vi­ously re­ported that the Loh cousins had paid $20 mil­lion for a 55 per cent stake in two day surgery cen­tres – Ap­tus Surgery Cen­tre at Paragon Med­i­cal</p>
    <p>Cen­tre and No­vap­tus Surgery Cen­tre at Cam­den Med­i­cal Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Novena Ap­tus and Novena No­vap­tus were sup­posed to be the hold­ing com­pa­nies for shares to be trans­ferred from Ap­tus Surgery and No­vap­tus Surgery cen­tres.</p>
    <p>But Dr Lim Beng Hai, chair­man of the board of di­rec­tors of the two cen­tres, told ST pre­vi­ously that the ac­qui­si­tion did not hap­pen and the stake was not $20 mil­lion as the Lohs had claimed.</p>
