    <p>LON­DON • Pep Guardi­ola is op­ti­mistic that Manchester City are on course to chal­lenge Liver­pool again for the Premier League ti­tle, af­ter tem­po­rar­ily climb­ing to fifth and within five points of the lead­ers with a rou­tine 2-0 win over New­cas­tle on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>At a rain and windswept Eti­had as Storm Bella swept into Manchester, it was plain sail­ing for the hosts as goals ei­ther side of half-time from Ilkay Gun­do­gan and Fer­ran Tor­res ex­tended their un­beaten run i n all com­pe­ti­tions to 10 games.</p>
    <p>City’s lack of goals has un­usu­ally been their un­do­ing so far this sea­son but de­spite again not hit­ting the free-flow­ing heights of pre­vi­ous years un­der Guardi­ola, an im­pres­sive de­fen­sive record is mov­ing them back into con­tention.</p>
    <p>An eighth clean sheet in 10 games never looked threat­ened against a New­cas­tle side lack­ing in in­tent or threat, with top scorer Cal­lum Wil­son left on the bench.</p>
    <p>“There are weird re­sults for ev­ery­one. This sea­son is about be­ing calm in the good and bad mo­ments,” said Guardi­ola, whose side scored more than once for just the third time in 12 league games this term. “I have the feel­ing we are get­ting bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>His op­tions had been lim­ited be­fore kick-off, with Kyle Walker and Gabriel Je­sus test­ing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus along with two mem­bers of the City staff.</p>
    <p>While their ab­sence was not telling against the Mag­pies, it could be more keenly felt this week, as they travel to sec­ond­placed Ever­ton to­day and Chelsea on Sun­day in tough tests of their abil­ity to reel in lead­ers Liver­pool.</p>
    <p>“We played at the tempo we have to play. We are a team that needs to make a lot of passes, not run so much and at­tack in the right mo­ments. To­day, our po­si­tional game was per­fect,” added Guardi­ola. “Un­for­tu­nately, we could not score more goals but it is a good re­sult and three more points.”</p>
    <p>City threw away two points in their last home game, a 1-1 draw with West Brom, and even Kevin de Bruyne, their player of the year last sea­son, has suf­fered from a lack of con­fi­dence in front of goal.</p>
    <p>The Belgium mid­fielder has yet to score from open play this sea­son but Joao Cancelo was an un­likely source of in­spi­ra­tion from right­back.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing City last sea­son, the Por­tu­gal in­ter­na­tional has been a bit-part player. But he did no harm to his chances of stak­ing a claim for a first-team spot in the ab­sence of Walker, af­ter be­ing in­volved in the build-up to both their two goals.</p>
