    <p>Lead­ers of the 20 big­gest world economies – the Group of 20 (G-20) – will de­bate this week­end how to deal with the Covid-19 pan­demic that has caused a global re­ces­sion and how to man­age the re­cov­ery once the coron­avirus is un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>High on the agenda are pur­chases and global dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines, drugs and tests for low­in­come coun­tries that can­not af­ford such ex­penses them­selves.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union was to urge the G-20 to in­vest US$4.5 bil­lion (S$6 bil­lion) to help. It will pro­pose a treaty on pan­demics.</p>
    <p>In his open­ing re­marks to G-20 lead­ers, Saudi ruler, King Sal­man bin Ab­du­laziz Al Saud, stressed the need for eq­ui­table ac­cess to the tools to com­bat Covid-19, in­clud­ing vac­cines. “We must work to cre­ate the con­di­tions for af­ford­able and eq­ui­table ac­cess to th­ese tools for all peo­ples,” he told the group via video link.</p>
    <p>“An in­ter­na­tional treaty would help us re­spond more quickly and in a more co­or­di­nated man­ner,” Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel is ex­pected to tell the G-20 to­day.</p>
    <p>While the global econ­omy is re­cov­er­ing from the depths of the cri­sis ear­lier this year, mo­men­tum is slow­ing in coun­tries with resurg­ing in­fec­tion rates, the re­cov­ery is un­even and the pan­demic is likely to leave deep scars, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund said in a re­port for the G-20 summit.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble are poor and highly in­debted coun­tries in the de­vel­op­ing world, which are “on the precipice of fi­nan­cial ruin and es­ca­lat­ing poverty, hunger and un­told suf­fer­ing”, United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress this, the G-20 will en­dorse a plan to ex­tend a debt ser­vic­ing mora­to­rium for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries by six months to the mid­dle of next year, with a pos­si­bil­ity of a fur­ther ex­ten­sion, said a draft G-20 com­mu­nique seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean mem­bers of the G-20 are likely to push for more.</p>
    <p>“More debt re­lief is needed,” Mr Michel told re­porters on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Debt re­lief for Africa will be an im­por­tant theme of the Ital­ian pres­i­dency of the G-20 next year.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean na­tions in the G-20 will also seek fresh im­pe­tus to the stalled re­form of the World Trade</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tion, hop­ing to cap­i­talise on the up­com­ing change of the United States ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“We must also con­tinue to sup­port the global econ­omy and re­open our economies and bor­ders to fa­cil­i­tate the mo­bil­ity of trade and peo­ple,” King Sal­man said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, Saudi Ara­bia’s Min­is­ter of In­vest­ment Khalid alFalih said this year’s cri­sis has high­lighted the im­por­tance of mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“The G-20, its essence, is ac­ti­vat­ing mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, and of course this has taken a back seat over the last few years,” he said.</p>
    <p>Out­go­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who at­tended the summit yes­ter­day, favoured bi­lat­eral trade deals over work­ing through in­ter­na­tional bod­ies.</p>
    <p>The change of US lead­er­ship also raises hopes of a more con­certed ef­fort at the G-20 level to fight cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the ex­am­ple of the EU, al­ready half of the G-20 mem­bers, in­clud­ing Ja­pan, China, South Korea and South Africa, plan to be­come cli­mate- or at least car­bon­neu­tral by 2050 or soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Trump, the US pulled out of the Paris Agree­ment on fight­ing cli­mate change, but the de­ci­sion is likely to be re­versed by Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>To help fi­nance the fight against cli­mate change, the EU will push for the G-20 to agree on com­mon global stan­dards on what con­sti­tutes “green” in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>This would help at­tract the massive pri­vate in­vest­ment needed be­cause many in­vest­ment funds are keen to in­vest in en­vi­ron­men­tally sus­tain­able projects, but there is no agreed way of se­lect­ing them.</p>
    <p>The EU is al­ready work­ing on such stan­dards, and plans to have them in place by 2022.</p>
    <p>AF­FORD­ABLE AC­CESS FOR ALL</p>
    <p>Although we are op­ti­mistic about the progress made in de­vel­op­ing vac­cines, ther­a­peu­tics and di­ag­nos­tic tools for Covid-19, we must work to cre­ate the con­di­tions for af­ford­able and eq­ui­table ac­cess to th­ese tools for all peo­ples.</p>
