    <p>• Re­tired screen le­gend Brigitte Lin Ching-hsia has opened up on so­cial me­dia about her fa­mous friends, such as ac­tress Joey Wong and the late singers Anita Mui and Teresa Teng.</p>
    <p>The rem­i­nisc­ing was prompted by her Weibo post of a Louis Vuit­ton make-up case on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“It has been 35 years since it was taken out to­day. Al­though it is mouldy, it still func­tions and is very good and very solid,” she wrote. The case was a gift from long­time friend Nan­sun Shi, a famed pro­ducer and former wife of film-maker Tsui Hark.</p>
    <p>Fans then asked her to re­veal more about other stars and she had only nice things to say.</p>
    <p>Lin said of Wong, widely re­garded as one of the “four flow­ers” of the Hong Kong movie in­dus­try for her beauty: “(She) is so tall, her skin is so del­i­cate and fair, and she speaks softly with a slightly breathy voice and likes to laugh very much.”</p>
    <p>Lin, 66, who left show busi­ness in 1994 af­ter her mar­riage to Hong Kong busi­ness­man Michael Ying, re­vived her Weibo ac­count a cou­ple of months ago af­ter a hia­tus of six years.</p>
    <p>Be­sides pro­mot­ing her new book – In Front And Be­hind The Mir­ror, the third and fi­nal in­stal­ment of a tril­ogy which charts her il­lus­tri­ous ca­reer – she has been in­ter­act­ing with her fans on Weibo, tak­ing the time to re­spond to al­most ev­ery com­ment.</p>
    <p>When asked about Tai­wanese singer Teng, who died in 1995 of a se­vere asthma at­tack, she said: “She was some­one who was con­sid­er­ate of oth­ers in ev­ery way.”</p>
    <p>Lin was then asked about Mui, whom she had also men­tioned in an es­say in her lat­est book.</p>
    <p>She re­called that Shi had phoned her and wept over Mui’s death in 2003 from cer­vi­cal can­cer at the age of 40.</p>
    <p>“I dreamt about Shi and Mui that night and had an in­tense headache the next day. The pul­sat­ing neu­ro­log­i­cal pain lasted sev­eral days,” she wrote in her es­say.</p>
    <p>On Weibo, she praised Mui, us­ing the Chi­nese phrase “jianghu ernu”, which im­plied that she re­garded the late singer as loyal, care­free and bold.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of ne­ti­zens also asked for her thoughts on the late Hong Kong star Les­lie Che­ung, who com­mit­ted sui­cide at the age of 46 on April 1, 2003. As it was a sen­si­tive topic, she said: “Let me think about how to write it.”</p>
