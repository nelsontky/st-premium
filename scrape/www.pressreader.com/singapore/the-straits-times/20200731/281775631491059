    <p>The pre­vi­ous record daily count of new in­fec­tions in Aus­tralia was 518 re­ported on Mon­day. The coun­try has con­firmed over 16,200 cases since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said that while the lat­est spike in cases was wor­ry­ing, the ma­jor­ity of them were in known hot spots such as aged­care homes and the num­ber of un­trace­able in­fec­tions was “much smaller”.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state, New South Wales, re­ported 18 new cases, with six from un­known sources.</p>
    <p>The north-east­ern state of Queens­land, which had ef­fec­tively elim­i­nated the virus, said it had found three new cases, two of whom were be­lieved to have con­tracted Covid-19 while in the New South Wales cap­i­tal of Syd­ney. Queens­land closed its bor­ders to peo­ple from Syd­ney on Wednes­day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said two 19-year-old women who brought the virus into the state after re­turn­ing from a trip to Vic­to­ria had fal­si­fied travel doc­u­ments and lied to the au­thor­i­ties about their move­ments. Both now face crim­i­nal charges but one of them still re­fuses to tell of­fi­cials where she had been. Queens­land has also de­nied en­try to any­one who had been to Vic­to­ria in the pre­vi­ous 14 days.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian govern­ment has urged peo­ple to “come out of their homes” to boost the econ­omy, warn­ing that there are lim­its to what state cof­fers can do amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity has been dras­ti­cally re­duced as many do not dare leave home, as they avoid meet­ing oth­ers phys­i­cally,” said Mr Budi Sadikin, head of the eco­nomic re­cov­ery task force in the govern­ment’s Covid-19 re­sponse team.</p>
    <p>“Mean­while, vir­tual ac­tiv­i­ties – in place of the usual phys­i­cal con­tact – have not ad­e­quately fu­elled the econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>He added: “If we con­tinue to re­main in (par­tial) lock­downs, our fis­cal space would no longer be sus­tained.”</p>
    <p>Mr Budi’s ap­peal on Wednes­day came as it ap­peared the coun­try could be head­ing for a re­ces­sion with a sec­ond quar­ter of neg­a­tive growth.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct is likely to shrink by at least 3 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>De­spite strug­gling to curb the spread of Covid-19, cities and prov­inces across the sprawl­ing ar­chi­pel­ago have grad­u­ally eased re­stric­tive mea­sures im­posed as part of par­tial lock­downs.</p>
    <p>The world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous coun­try, with 270 mil­lion peo­ple, de­clared its first in­fec­tions in early March.</p>
    <p>Of­fices in the cap­i­tal of Jakarta started to re­open in the first week of last month, with work­ers put on stag­gered ros­ters and go­ing to the of­fice on al­ter­nate days.</p>
    <p>They have also been told to avoid crowd­ing at meal times and in lifts.</p>
    <p>Shop­ping malls were also al­lowed to re­open in mid-June.</p>
    <p>Bali, In­done­sia’s tourism hot spot, is due to re­open to­day to do­mes­tic tourists and to for­eign tourists pos­si­bly on Sept 11.</p>
    <p>While stress­ing the need for strict safe­guards, Mr Budi on Wednes­day re­as­sured peo­ple on go­ing about their nor­mal busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Doc­tors to­day know bet­ter how to treat pa­tients, so chances of re­cov­ery have much im­proved.</p>
    <p>“They have higher ther­a­peu­tic stan­dards and health pro­to­col stan­dards, and an­tivi­ral drugs are widely avail­able,” he said.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment data shows the re­cov­ery rate of Covid-19 pa­tients in the coun­try ris­ing to above 40 per cent this month, from 37 per cent last month, 22 per cent in May, 10 per cent in April and 4 per cent in March.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gist Pandu Riono, who teaches at the fac­ulty of pub­lic health at the Univer­sity of In­done­sia, re­mained scep­ti­cal about en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to en­ter a “new nor­mal”, say­ing that this could be pos­si­ble only with in­creased surveil­lance and strict health pro­to­cols – like mask-wear­ing, fre­quent hand wash­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing – in place.</p>
