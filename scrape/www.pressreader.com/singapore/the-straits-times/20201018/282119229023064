    <p>Do po­etry lovers pout and rage and pit W.H. Au­den against John Keats? Is there such a thing as The Best in verse? Do vi­o­lin folk loudly mock their bud­dies as mu­si­cally il­lit­er­ate if they put Itzhak Pearl­man and Ye­hudi Menuhin in the in­cor­rect or­der of merit?</p>
    <p>Sports fans will tell you we do this con­stantly. At any given time we can of­fer you a bril­liantly judged, un­abashed, bi­ased, unar­guable opin­ion on the Great­est in any­thing. In the bas­ket­ball air, on clay, be­hind a wheel, in water. If you dis­agree we will pity you.</p>
    <p>This week the sub­jects are LeBron James ver­sus Michael Jor­dan, and Lewis Hamil­ton ver­sus Michael Schu­macher. Mean­while Rafa’s tena­cious fol­low­ers will fence with Roger’s artis­tic devo­tees over whose 20 Grand Slams have more heft. Even if things are equal they’re some­how not, for ev­ery­one brings their own weigh­ing scale.</p>
    <p>The Great­est is a mod­ern thing for not ev­ery­one kept stats in an­cient times. Babe Didrik­son won Olympic medals in the high jump, 80m hur­dles and javelin in 1932 and then won 10 Ma­jors in women’s golf. We may not have data about greens by her hit in reg­u­la­tion, but we have, as ESPN re­ported, a fel­low golfer say­ing: “She’d turn to the gallery and say, ‘Don’t you fel­las wish you could hit it like that’.”</p>
    <p>How do you rank that?</p>
    <p>Great­est ath­lete is also not just a case of longevity but lon­gi­tude. When sum­mer folk sip cock­tails and dis­cuss the Great­est women’s ath­lete (Ser­ena Wil­liams, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Nadia Co­maneci etc), you can bet Marit Bjor­gen’s name never comes up. She won 15 Olympic medals, but in that for­eign sport of cross-coun­try ski­ing.</p>
    <p>Bi­ases sit deep within us like an un­recog­nised virus. When we com­pare wheels, we head for Valentino Rossi and Ayr­ton Senna and Vic­to­ria Pendle­ton, but un­for­giv­ably pass by Tatyana Mc­Fad­den, 16 Par­a­lympic medals worth of ta­lent in a wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>Time mat­ters in this ar­gu­ment and so does footage. If we had end­less, clear film of the unique Gar­rin­cha at work we might give him more votes than we do. A</p>
    <p>Stock­holm news­pa­per – as Ruy Cas­tro’s book on the foot­baller re­veals – once ran this head­line in 1958: Con­grat­u­la­tions Gothen­burg, On Thurs­day You Get To See Gar­rin­cha Again!</p>
    <p>In the old days no memo went out to in­form ath­letes that in an­other cen­tury we’d be ob­sess­ing over num­bers. No­vak Djokovic has eight Aus­tralian Open ti­tles but Bjorn Borg played there only once (third round, 1974). And so what­ever math­e­mat­i­cal gym­nas­tics we do to anoint the Great­est, it bet­ter come with an as­ter­isk: Mod­ern Era Only.</p>
    <p>Purists will in­sist, and why not, that the Great­est is a mat­ter of wins. To­tal up vic­to­ries and give out the tro­phy. But what about years as No. 1? Va­ri­ety of sur­faces? Level of com­pe­ti­tion? Only Grand Slam wins and for­get the rest of the year?</p>
    <p>So then Ser­ena, 23 Slams in sin­gles, is lesser than Margaret Court, 24? Give me a break. Mean­while a St­effi Graf devo­tee I know is so sure that the fraulein with 22 Slams comes first that no sledge­ham­mer of logic and arith­metic can shift her.</p>
    <p>Which num­bers should we use any­way? Who gets to de­cide? And is one suf­fi­cient? Is Lionel Messi, man of magic, in­el­i­gi­ble for any Great­est award be­cause he doesn’t have a World Cup? Bad luck, sonny. But then why don’t they call Rocky Mar­ciano the Great­est, for he was the only heavy­weight cham­pion to re­tire un­de­feated at 49-0?</p>
    <p>Take a bath­room break. We’re far from done.</p>
    <p>Is it pos­si­ble to play a game bet­ter than any­one else but not have the numer­i­cal proof? Jack Nick­laus has 18 golf Ma­jors, Tiger Woods has 15, and yet Nick­laus will tell you his heir did things with a golf ball he’s not fa­mil­iar with. It’s modest and kind. Ex­cept that Nick­laus also has 19 sec­ond-place fin­ishes at Ma­jors and Woods has six. Ir­rel­e­vant?</p>
    <p>This is fun but it’s com­pli­cated and that is the al­lure of it. There are too many weigh­ing scales at work and too many ways to award points. What’s the value of runs scored by old-time bats­men who didn’t use hel­mets against skull-test­ing fast bowlers? No bonus marks for tech­nique and brav­ery?</p>
    <p>I’m less cer­tain than ever if win­ning alone seals the deal, for other fac­tors start to nag. How have Nike’s shoes as­sisted run­ners? How has sci­ence, slower grass courts, diet, the faster speed of most sports and the masses of data which is avail­able for ath­letes to plot their way for­ward made a dif­fer­ence?</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, does it mat­ter how many peo­ple woke up for an ath­lete, the ef­fect they had on a so­ci­ety, how they lifted their sport and what rules were rewrit­ten to stop them? Or is that just bunk?</p>
    <p>Frank Vo­gel, the LA Lak­ers coach, rates James higher than Jor­dan and said, “If you think you know, you don’t know. Un­til you’re around him ev­ery day, you’re coach­ing him, you’re see­ing his mind, you’re see­ing his ad­just­ments, see­ing the way he leads the group.”</p>
    <p>He has a point. Do we add up only as­sists but not in­flu­ence? And for that mat­ter, does Fed­erer’s abil­ity to play shots no one had pre­vi­ously imag­ined count for zero? And what about Muham­mad Ali’s ban, Ben Ho­gan’s aw­ful car ac­ci­dent, Wilma Ru­dolph’s bat­tle with po­lio – can we in­tro­duce all these as ev­i­dence? Or is it ir­rel­e­vant to the case?</p>
    <p>James, like Hamil­ton, has a pow­er­ful thing in his favour which is re­cency. He plays now, “live” on ev­ery screen, his feats im­me­di­ate, his aura be­fore us. For many, he must feel like the Great­est.</p>
    <p>But Jor­dan will just light a new cigar, puff, lean back and grin. There are no sure an­swers and he cer­tainly will have a ques­tion?</p>
    <p>Hey kid, seen The Last Dance yet?</p>
    <p>Which num­bers should we use any­way? Who gets to de­cide? And is one suf­fi­cient? Is Lionel Messi, man of magic, in­el­i­gi­ble for any Great­est award be­cause he doesn’t have a World Cup? Bad luck, sonny. But then why don’t they call Rocky Mar­ciano the Great­est, for he was the only heavy­weight cham­pion to re­tire un­de­feated at 49-0?</p>
