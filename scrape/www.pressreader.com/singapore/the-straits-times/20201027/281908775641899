    <p>Thai­land’s protests have spread to ar­eas and in­sti­tu­tions where Thais have tra­di­tion­ally al­ways feared to tread – the monar­chy. What be­gan as a de­mand for the res­ig­na­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha and amend­ments to the Con­sti­tu­tion has ex­tended to calls for re­forms to curb the pow­ers of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, risk­ing at­ten­tion from the world’s strictest lese ma­jeste laws. The gov­ern­ment reached for harsh emer­gency pow­ers on Oct 15. But when the protests did not sub­side, it with­drew the emer­gency and Mr Prayut went on tele­vi­sion ap­peal­ing for calm. The protesters say they want him out and all le­gal ac­tion against their lead­ers ended.</p>
    <p>This is not an en­tirely un­fa­mil­iar turn in Thai his­tory. Af­ter all, Mr Prayut him­self rose to power in the wake of the 2014 un­rest. Nev­er­the­less, other In­dochi­nese states, no­tably Laos and Cam­bo­dia, are un­der­stand­ably ner­vous about the youth-led protests reach­ing their door. This is be­cause it does not look like Thai­land’s protests, al­ready three months long, are likely to ebb any time soon. On Sun­day, thou­sands gath­ered again in the cen­tre of Bangkok af­ter Mr Prayut ig­nored their Satur­day night dead­line to quit. Ger­many is also in the sights of protesters as they seek to ques­tion the monarch’s sta­tus in that coun­try where he spends much of his time when abroad. This is clearly an­other di­rect mes­sage to the King. While he has not com­mented on the protests, it does help Thai­land that he has been back in his coun­try for nearly a fort­night to com­mem­o­rate a Bud­dhist hol­i­day and the death of his fa­ther, King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej, who died in Oc­to­ber 2016. It would per­haps soothe more frayed tem­pers if he spent more time at home rather than in Europe, what­ever may be his con­sid­er­a­tions for do­ing so.</p>
    <p>The monar­chy is still the most re­spected, even revered, in­sti­tu­tion in Thai­land. But Thais clearly also want to see their King in more of the role that was syn­ony­mous with the coun­try’s cul­tural and na­tional iden­tity. Mean­while, Par­lia­ment is de­bat­ing the cri­sis this week. Thai­land’s econ­omy was al­ready slow­ing when the pan­demic struck, fur­ther crimp­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for mil­lions of young Thais. Po­lit­i­cally, they seem dis­en­chanted as much by the po­lar­is­ing pol­i­tics em­bod­ied by the yel­low-shirt move­ment, which rep­re­sents con­ser­vatism, as by the red-shirt move­ment that was spawned by the ousted for­mer prime min­is­ter Thaksin Shi­nawa­tra, with his strong ru­ral base.</p>
    <p>To the credit of the Prayut gov­ern­ment, it seems to recog­nise that reach­ing for the fa­mil­iar play­book of harsh laws and uni­formed forces to quell protests will not work now, es­pe­cially given the peace­ful na­ture of the protests. A sta­ble and pros­per­ous Thai­land is im­por­tant for its ci­ti­zens and the re­gion. An em­pa­thetic and mea­sured re­sponse from all key play­ers could prove more of a balm to the coun­try’s cur­rent woes.</p>
