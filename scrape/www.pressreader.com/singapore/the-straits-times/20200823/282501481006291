    <p>Prior to the pan­demic, it seemed that the epit­ome of a good ed­u­ca­tion was found only in elite schools, aug­mented by end­less after-school en­rich­ment, tu­ition and sup­ple­men­tary classes.</p>
    <p>Many par­ents be­lieved that the more their chil­dren left their homes for aca­demic pur­suits, the bet­ter their chances of do­ing well in school.</p>
    <p>Then Covid-19 hit and every­body had to stay home.</p>
    <p>World­wide, most schools de­ployed off-the-shelf learn­ing man­age­ment sys­tems that dis­pensed home­work as a stop-gap mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure, teach­ers were forced to slap to­gether Zoom and video classes quickly, de­liv­ered in for­mats they were nei­ther fa­mil­iar nor com­fort­able with.</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial en­ti­ties took the op­por­tu­nity to launch some­times half-baked on­line learn­ing plat­forms, mostly in the form of video con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>There were also hor­ror sto­ries of hack­ers en­ter­ing kids’ class­rooms to wreak havoc. Par­ents started to ques­tion if this was the kind of ed­u­ca­tion that would help their chil­dren ace the school sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But even be­fore 2020, there were al­ready rum­blings that school sys­tems were no longer rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple know that the cur­rent K to 12 (kinder­garten to Grade 12) com­pul­sory ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem is out­dated. It started in Prus­sia in 1800, borne out of the need to have a large work­force dur­ing the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion age. While mass ed­u­ca­tion has re­duced il­lit­er­acy and ben­e­fited bil­lions of peo­ple, it is still a 200-year-old sys­tem that has failed to keep up with the times.</p>
    <p>The tra­di­tional school sys­tem, where the teacher acted as the sage on stage dis­pens­ing knowl­edge, worked won­ders for my gen­er­a­tion, but why should it be ef­fec­tive for those born after 1999?</p>
    <p>These dig­i­tal na­tives found their own al­ter­na­tives to the 45-minute lec­ture – a two-minute YouTube video made by a world-class in­struc­tor, played at 1.8 x nor­mal speed.</p>
    <p>There is a grow­ing recog­ni­tion that the era of mass ed­u­ca­tion is over. Covid-19 sig­nals it is time to em­bark on in­di­vid­u­alised ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>As a mother of five chil­dren aged 17 to 26, I’ve learnt ed­u­ca­tion is not what our chil­dren can get out of schools. Rather, ed­u­ca­tion is what I can put into a child.</p>
    <p>To put the right ed­u­ca­tion into my child, I need to first spend time to un­der­stand his or her pas­sions, gifts and learn­ing styles. Most peo­ple like to work on what they are good at, so I ob­serve what my kids want to work on, then find re­sources to bring out their fullest po­ten­tial, while lev­el­ling them up in ar­eas they are weak in.</p>
    <p>The main ob­jec­tive is to build up their con­fi­dence by al­low­ing them to ex­cel at things they love.</p>
    <p>I loved teach­ing my own chil­dren. From learn­ing how to model math­e­mat­ics ques­tions to tak­ing cour­ses to up­date my com­puter pro­gram­ming skills, I found my­self con­stantly up­grad­ing just to par­tic­i­pate in my kids’ ed­u­ca­tion ac­tively. Our home has been the most im­por­tant learn­ing venue for my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Not every­body agrees with my ap­proach. But it has al­ways puz­zled me. Why spend time try­ing to ace a sys­tem when I can use it to give my chil­dren a great ed­u­ca­tion?</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has started us off with the great home-based learn­ing ex­per­i­ment. How­ever, to fully har­ness the strengths of home­based learn­ing, in­struc­tional de­sign must not only lever­age tech­nol­ogy to fully in­te­grate with school-based learn­ing, but it must also fully in­volve par­ents, ed­u­ca­tors and peers. For starters, par­ents must get in­volved. First, with kids study­ing at home, we can ob­serve their learn­ing styles and pro­vide valu­able in­sights to their teach­ers.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, we can ac­quire free and paid re­sources to ac­ti­vate bet­ter learn­ing. Stu­dents can now work on the top­ics which they are most pas­sion­ate about, at the level they are most com­fort­able with. Do not be afraid to go for ma­te­ri­als be­yond your child’s level ac­cord­ing to the school cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>Be­sides in­struc­tor-led ac­tiv­i­ties, I like to pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents to do re­search and self-study at their own pace, as well as en­gage with their peers to learn how to ne­go­ti­ate, fol­low and lead. I also give them time and space to re­flect on les­sons.</p>
    <p>My chil­dren earned their bach­e­lor’s de­grees be­fore they turned 18.</p>
    <p>The on­line in­ter­na­tional school, which I started in 2015, has also rad­i­cally ac­cel­er­ated about 300 stu­dents from Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, Aus­tralia, In­done­sia, Hong Kong and China with dif­fer­ent ca­pa­bil­i­ties, from those with learn­ing dis­abil­i­ties, who were streamed into Nor­mal Tech at the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion, to those who are ex­cep­tion­ally gifted.</p>
    <p>As al­ways for me, it is not about how much stu­dents achieve aca­dem­i­cally, but how happy they are in the process that counts.</p>
