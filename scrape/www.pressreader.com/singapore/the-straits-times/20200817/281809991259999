    <p>PORT LOUIS (Mau­ri­tius) • A ship that has leaked more than 1,000 tons of oil in pris­tine waters off the Mau­ri­tius coast has split into two, its Ja­panese op­er­a­tor said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The bulk car­rier MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef off the south-east­ern coast of Mau­ri­tius on July 25 and be­gan ooz­ing oil more than a week later, threat­en­ing a pro­tected marine park that is home to man­grove forests and en­dan­gered species.</p>
    <p>Mau­ri­tius de­clared an en­vi­ron­men­tal emer­gency and sal­vage crews raced against the clock to pump the re­main­ing 3,000 tons of oil off the ship.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of Mau­ri­tians have vol­un­teered day and night to clean the pow­der-blue waters that have long been a favourite among hon­ey­moon­ers and tourists. Sci­en­tists say the full im­pact of the spill is still un­fold­ing, but the dam­age could af­fect Mau­ri­tius and its tourism-de­pen­dent econ­omy for decades.</p>
    <p>“It was con­firmed on Aug 15 that the ves­sel has bro­ken into two,” the ship’s op­er­a­tor Mit­sui OSK Lines said in a state­ment, not­ing that the in­for­ma­tion came from the ves­sel’s owner Na­gashiki Ship­ping.</p>
    <p>The split was caused by a crack in a cargo hold on its stern side, Mit­sui said.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials had been pre­par­ing for the devel­op­ment for days, and im­ages taken on Satur­day in­di­cated it was in­evitable, with the two pieces only par­tially at­tached.</p>
    <p>Mit­sui yes­ter­day said “an amount of un­re­cov­ered oil is be­lieved to have leaked out of the ves­sel”.</p>
    <p>The sal­vage team in­tends to pull the front two-thirds of the ship out to sea us­ing two tug­boats and let it sink to avoid fur­ther dam­age to the Mau­ri­tian coast­line, said a po­lice of­fi­cial in the Mau­ri­tian cap­i­tal Port Louis, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity be­cause he was not au­tho­rised to brief the me­dia.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing por­tion is still stuck on the reef and of­fi­cials have not yet deter­mined how they might re­move it, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The weather is ex­pected to be­come rougher in the com­ing days, the Mau­ri­tius govern­ment said in a state­ment on Satur­day night, not­ing that waves could climb to 4.5m.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Pravind Jug­nauth has come un­der fire, in­clud­ing from op­po­si­tion lead­ers, for do­ing too lit­tle in the week after the ship ran aground.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi said on Satur­day that Tokyo planned to send a team of of­fi­cials from the min­istry and other spe­cial­ists to as­sess the dam­age.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of Mau­ri­tians have vol­un­teered day and night to clean the pow­der-blue waters that have long been a favourite among hon­ey­moon­ers and tourists.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say the full im­pact of the spill is still un­fold­ing, but the dam­age could af­fect Mau­ri­tius and its tourism-de­pen­dent econ­omy for decades.</p>
