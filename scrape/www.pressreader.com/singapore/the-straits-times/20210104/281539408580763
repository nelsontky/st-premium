    <p>The lit­tle-known prac­tice of il­le­gal prison cook­ing, or “masak”, is doc­u­mented in a new book. Based on the ex­pe­ri­ences of eight for­mer in­mates in­ter­viewed by au­thor Sheere Ng, the book de­scribes the lengths to which in­mates would go to re­gain some sense of au­ton­omy be­hind bars, or sim­ply to break the monotony of prison life.</p>
    <p>It was the 1970s.</p>
    <p>As evening fell on pris­ons and drug re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tres across Sin­ga­pore, in­mates set to work striking care­fully saved ra­zor blades against bits of smug­gled flint to light fires in their cells.</p>
    <p>In the two-hour win­dow be­tween 7pm and lights-out time at 9pm, when no guard pa­trols were sched­uled, the men would re­pur­pose mugs and cham­ber pots to cook them­selves hot sup­pers out of mea­gre in­gre­di­ents like canned food, tau kwa (tofu squares) and wa­ter scooped from the toi­let bowl.</p>
    <p>The lit­tle-known prac­tice of il­le­gal prison cook­ing, or “masak”, which means to cook in Malay, is doc­u­mented in a book pub­lished late last year, ti­tled When Cook­ing Was A Crime: Masak In The Sin­ga­pore Pris­ons, 1970s-1980s.</p>
    <p>Based on the ex­pe­ri­ences of eight for­mer in­mates in­ter­viewed by food writer and au­thor Sheere Ng, 34, the book de­scribes the lengths to which in­mates would go to re­gain some sense of au­ton­omy be­hind bars, or sim­ply to break the monotony of prison life.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Straits Times, the for­mer Makan­su­tra food-guide ed­i­tor said she was in­ter­ested in writ­ing about prison food back in 2011. She ap­proached Mr Benny Se Teo, a chef and for­mer drug of­fender who founded so­cial en­ter­prise restau­rant chain Eigh­teen Chefs, which hires for­mer of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Ng: “I told him I was in­ter­ested to find out about prison food and he said: ‘I’ll tell you some­thing even bet­ter. I’ll tell you about masak.’</p>
    <p>“He asked me to come to his restau­rant and we spoke for two hours, but at the time, it was very hard to grasp be­cause there was a lot of jar­gon and prison par­lance.”</p>
    <p>In­trigued by the prac­tice, Ms Ng con­tacted other for­mer in­mates and a for­mer drug re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion cen­tre su­per­in­ten­dent through church net­works and per­sonal con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>The for­mer in­mates re­vealed how al­most any­thing could be used as cook­ing fuel for masak, from scraps of fab­ric and plas­tic bags to makeshift can­dles formed from melted pieces of plas­tic food trays stolen dur­ing of­fi­cial meal times.</p>
    <p>In­gre­di­ents could be ob­tained from fel­low in­mates who served as cooks i n the prison kitchens, bought with prison wages at the com­mis­sary, or sim­ply por­tions of food from lunch or din­ner set aside for later use.</p>
    <p>With a healthy serv­ing of cre­ativ­ity and a dash of imag­i­na­tion, dishes like “laksa”, “ban mian” and even “bubur cha cha” dessert could be recre­ated in the cell.</p>
    <p>The prison ver­sions of these lo­cal favourites barely re­sem­bled their orig­i­nal forms, but they were a com­fort­ing es­cape for the in­mates, es­pe­cially when com­pared with their pro­vided meals which were in­vari­ably bland, repet­i­tive and al­ways served cold, said Ms Ng.</p>
    <p>“You close your eyes, you eat that warm food, and you feel as if you’re not in prison, you’re in Sin­ga­pore,” she added, not­ing that “Sin­ga­pore” meant the world out­side the prison walls.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng said she de­cided to pub­lish her find­ings as a book to show a dif­fer­ent side of the in­mates, who are of­ten seen merely as law­break­ers. She also wanted to show how food can take on dif­fer­ent mean­ings in Sin­ga­pore – food as pun­ish­ment, free­dom, con­trol or play – be­yond its more com­mon as­so­ci­a­tions with na­tional iden­tity or fa­mil­ial ties.</p>
    <p>“When you’re de­prived, you would be sur­prised by how far you would go, or how cre­ative you could be with the things that are avail­able, just to make your life a lit­tle bit more pleas­ant,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng col­lab­o­rated with a friend of her hus­band’s, free­lance pho­to­jour­nal­ist Don Wong, whose pho­tos of the dishes de­scribed by the in­mates are fea­tured in the book.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong recre­ated the dishes in his home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The book was pub­lished by writ­ing stu­dio In Plain Words, which is run by Ms Ng and her hus­band Justin Zhuang. It is avail­able at the stu­dio’s web­site, in­plain­words.sg, and Ki­noku­niya book­store.</p>
