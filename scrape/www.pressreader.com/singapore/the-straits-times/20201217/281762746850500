    <p>Top Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) leader Zulka­r­naen, ar­rested last week in In­done­sia af­ter 18 years on the run over the 2002 Bali bomb­ings, was among 23 sus­pected mil­i­tants flown to the cap­i­tal Jakarta yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With their hands and feet cuffed, and wear­ing orange uni­forms and full face masks, the sus­pects were es­corted un­der the tight guard of the elite counter-ter­ror­ism squad De­tach­ment 88, as they ar­rived at Jakarta’s main Soekarno-Hatta In­ter­na­tional Air­port from Lam­pung province in Su­ma­tra.</p>
    <p>The sus­pects, all linked to the AlQaeda-af­fil­i­ated JI network, were nabbed in re­cent weeks in Jambi and Lam­pung prov­inces. They will be taken to a de­ten­tion cen­tre near Jakarta for fur­ther ques­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Po­lice spokesman Ah­mad Ra­mad­han told re­porters yes­ter­day that Zulka­r­naen, an In­done­sian na­tional who is also known as Aris Su­mar­sono, was an in­struc­tor at a mil­i­tary academy in Afghanista­n for seven years and helped to make the bombs in the deadly Bali at­tacks which killed 202 peo­ple, mostly for­eign tourists.</p>
    <p>“(He) has the abil­ity to as­sem­ble high-ex­plo­sive bombs, firearms and has mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” he said, ad­ding that Zulka­r­naen was also the mas­ter­mind be­hind a se­ries of at­tacks in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Since May 2005, he has been listed on an Al-Qaeda sanc­tions list by the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil for be­ing associated with Osama bin Laden or the Tale­ban.</p>
    <p>An­other high-pro­file sus­pect on the flight was Upik Lawanga, who al­legedly made bombs for the JI network.</p>
    <p>Upik had been on the run since 2005, af­ter he was named a sus­pect in an at­tack that killed more than 20 peo­ple at a mar­ket in Poso, the hot­bed of Islamic mil­i­tancy in Cen­tral Su­lawesi.</p>
