    <p>A Sin­ga­porean who trav­elled to In­done­sia un­der the Busi­ness Travel Pass was one of 12 new im­ported Covid-19 cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He is the se­cond known per­son hold­ing such a pass here to be in­fected. The pre­vi­ous pa­tient was an­nounced on Nov 9 af­ter re­turn­ing from travel to the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Those on this pass are re­quired to abide by a con­trolled itin­er­ary when they travel abroad for work.</p>
    <p>Upon re­turn, they are given the op­tion to take a Covid-19 test in lieu of serv­ing a stay-home no­tice, and to self-iso­late un­til the test re­sults are out.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said the pa­tient who had trav­elled to In­done­sia went for a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test when he re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on Nov 28, and self-iso­lated while wait­ing for his test re­sult. His test came back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>When he de­vel­oped symp­toms on Dec 2, he was tested again for Covid-19 at a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clinic. He was con­firmed to have the coro­n­avirus on Fri­day, and is cur­rently iso­lated at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Prior to hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, he had gone to work at ASL Ship­yard at 19 Pan­dan Road, but had not in­ter­acted with his col­leagues.</p>
    <p>All his iden­ti­fied close con­tacts have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The 11 other im­ported cases had al­ready been placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>There was also one lo­cally trans­mit­ted case of the coro­n­avirus. He is a Filipino crew mem­ber who ar­rived from the Philip­pines on the Nor­mand Aus­tralis, which docked at Tuas Port on Nov 18.</p>
    <p>MOH said he had al­ready been placed on quar­an­tine at a gov­ern­ment fa­cil­ity since Nov 22, hav­ing had close con­tact with an­other Covid-19 pa­tient. Prior to that, he had not dis­em­barked from the ship.</p>
    <p>Be­fore board­ing the ship, he took a Covid-19 pre-de­par­ture swab on</p>
    <p>Nov 2 that came back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>All 18 crew mem­bers were swabbed on Nov 19 and were placed on quar­an­tine as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure.</p>
    <p>The new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,255.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, MOH or­dered the Seoul Gar­den out­let in Tampines Mall to sus­pend full op­er­a­tions for 10 days from yes­ter­day for fail­ing to com­ply with Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>With six cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,143 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 26 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 42 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
