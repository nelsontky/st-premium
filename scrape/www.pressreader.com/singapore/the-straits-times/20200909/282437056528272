    <p>Sony’s WH-1000XM4, suc­ces­sor to the crit­i­cally ac­claimed WH1000XM3 wire­less over-ear head­phones, is fi­nally here af­ter a long wait of two years.</p>
    <p>In terms of looks, it does not dif­fer much from its pre­de­ces­sor, with a min­i­mal­ist de­sign, two big ear cups and a cush­ioned head­band. It is avail­able in black and sil­ver (ver­sion tested).</p>
    <p>The in­ner part of the ear cups feels larger than its pre­de­ces­sor’s, giv­ing my ears more room, while the ear cup pad­ding is soft and com­fort­able. The head­band does not clamp down, al­low­ing me to wear the head­phones for long pe­ri­ods of time with­out dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>At the bot­tom of the right ear cup are the power but­ton and a cus­tom but­ton for turn­ing on am­bi­ent sound or ac­tive noise can­cel­la­tion (ANC), along with a 3.5mm jack. At the bot­tom of the left ear cup is a USB-C port for charg­ing the head­phones.</p>
    <p>The ex­te­rior of the right ear cup is a touch-sen­si­tive panel. I find the touch con­trols in­tu­itive – swipe up or down to in­crease or lower the vol­ume, dou­ble tap to play or pause a track, swipe for­ward to skip to the next track, and swipe back­wards to re­turn to the pre­vi­ous track.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, it does not have a wa­ter-re­sis­tance rat­ing, so do not wear it for even gym work­outs.</p>
    <p>In terms of au­dio qual­ity, the WH-1000XM4 is su­perb.</p>
    <p>On my first try, the bass is punchy and the mids and tre­bles are sparkling, so I am un­der the im­pres­sion the bass boost mode is on.</p>
    <p>But when I check the Sony Head­phone Con­nect app (avail­able on An­droid and iOS), I re­alise it is on the de­fault flat equaliser (EQ) pre­set. With the rich and vi­brant way de­tails are pre­sented in this EQ mode, clas­si­cal mu­sic and Ja­panese com­poser Ki­taro’s tunes are an au­dio feast.</p>
    <p>The WH-1000XM3 is widely re­garded as hav­ing the best ANC of its genre. The WH-1000XM4 is just as good in this depart­ment. I think it just edges out its clos­est com­peti­tor, Bose’s lat­est Noise Can­celling Head­phones 700.</p>
    <p>The app of­fers a noise-can­cel­la­tion op­ti­miser that analy­ses sonic char­ac­ter­is­tics caused by the wearer’s head size, glasses and even hair, to tai­lor the noise can­cel­la­tion to each user.</p>
    <p>The ANC blocks out my “recre­ation” of the en­gine hum inside an air­plane cabin – which I sim­u­late with the max­i­mum fan set­ting of my decade-old air-con­di­tion­ing unit.</p>
    <p>It also cuts out noise from my neigh­bour’s home-im­prove­ment work up­stairs. I think I will be able to get hours of good sleep on long­haul flights if I wear it.</p>
    <p>The WH-1000XM4 also re­tains the Adap­tive Sound Con­trol fea­ture, which de­tects the wearer’s ac­tions and lo­ca­tion and au­to­mat­i­cally switches the head­phones to, say, am­bi­ent sound mode. This fea­ture may not be use­ful for the work­from-home bri­gade, though.</p>
    <p>More use­ful is its new abil­ity to be con­nected to two de­vices at the same time, such as a lap­top and a smart­phone.</p>
    <p>Say you are watch­ing a we­bi­nar on your lap­top and the phone rings. The head­phones will au­to­mat­i­cally switch from your lap­top to smart­phone so you can pick up the call.</p>
    <p>Not to men­tion, my call­ers tell me my voice comes across crys­tal clear. You can also man­u­ally switch be­tween your two paired de­vices.</p>
    <p>Also new is the Speak-to-Chat fea­ture, which au­to­mat­i­cally pauses mu­sic play­back and lets in am­bi­ent sound when it de­tects you are talk­ing, so you can have a con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This sounds good if you are in the of­fice, but ir­ri­tat­ing if you are work­ing from home and want to sing along to the tune you are lis­ten­ing to. How­ever, you can turn off this fea­ture in the app.</p>
    <p>In terms of bat­tery life, the WH-1000XM4 is rated at 30 hours with ANC on, much longer than the 20 hours of the Noise Can­celling Head­phones 700.</p>
    <p>In my test, I find that it has about 80 per cent bat­tery left af­ter six hours of mu­sic play­back with ANC turned on.</p>
