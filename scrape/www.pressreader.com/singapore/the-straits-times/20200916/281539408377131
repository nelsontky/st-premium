    <p>Pearl Div­ing, a story of a mys­te­ri­ous dis­ease that wrecks the world, has won Sin­ga­porean writer Sarah Ang, 21, an ad­ven­ture writ­ing prize. She was awarded the £1,000 (S$1,750) Au­thor of To­mor­row prize from the Lon­don-based Wilbur and Niso Smith Foun­da­tion, set up by the Bri­tish au­thor of the Courtney and Bal­lan­tyne sagas and his wife.</p>
    <p>See­ing news re­ports about the chaos and hear­ing heartrend­ing sto­ries about peo­ple who lost their loved ones and didn’t get to say good­bye, much like Pearl and her mother, made me imag­ine what it would be like to have a loved one suf­fer­ing from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A story of a mys­te­ri­ous dis­ease that wrecks the world has won Sin­ga­porean writer Sarah Ang, 21, an ad­ven­ture writ­ing prize from best­selling novelist Wilbur Smith.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, she was awarded the £1,000 (S$1,750) Au­thor of To­mor­row prize from the Lon­don-based Wilbur and Niso Smith Foun­da­tion, set up by the Bri­tish au­thor of the Courtney and Bal­lan­tyne sagas and his wife.</p>
    <p>The an­nual com­pe­ti­tion is open to short pieces of ad­ven­ture writ­ing in English from writ­ers aged 21 and younger. Ten works were short­listed across three age cat­e­gories from al­most 600 entries from around the world.</p>
    <p>Ang won the cat­e­gory for ages 16 to 21 with her post-apoc­a­lyp­tic story Pearl Div­ing, which is avail­able for free at read.worl­dreader.org (on mo­bile phone or tablet). “I was in­cred­i­bly thrilled to hear of my win be­cause the story meant so much to me and I poured a lot of my­self into it,” she says in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Her pro­tag­o­nist Pearl loves div­ing in the ocean like the ama, or Ja­panese pearl divers of yore.</p>
    <p>As a deadly dis­ease dev­as­tates the world, she is left to care for her sis­ter, who has fallen sick after their mother, a ma­rine bi­ol­o­gist, goes miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Ang, who is study­ing English lit­er­a­ture at Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don but is back in Sin­ga­pore due to Covid-19, drew on the pan­demic for in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“See­ing news re­ports about the chaos and hear­ing heartrend­ing sto­ries about peo­ple who lost their loved ones and didn’t get to say good­bye, much like Pearl and her mother, made me imag­ine what it would be like to have a loved one suf­fer­ing from the dis­ease,” she says.</p>
    <p>“But it is also more than a pan­demic story. I think the main char­ac­ter’s grap­pling with loss, the bonds of fam­ily and cen­tral strug­gle with a dif­fi­cult choice are things that tran­scend Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>She has been scrib­bling sto­ries since she was six years old and has won a num­ber of writ­ing com­pe­ti­tions here and abroad, such as the 2016 Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Po­etry Com­pe­ti­tion and the 2018 In­ter­na­tional iYeats Po­etry Com­pe­ti­tion. Her work has ap­peared in lo­cal an­tholo­gies like Who Are You My Coun­try? (2018).</p>
    <p>Her father works in an in­vest­ment firm and her mother is a re­tired civil ser­vant. She has a younger brother aged 18.</p>
    <p>She has yet to de­cide what to do with her prize money, though she wishes to use some of it to help those hit hard by the Covid-19 down­turn.</p>
    <p>She has al­ways been en­tranced by the ocean, though she has never gone div­ing, and based all the de­tails i n her story on online re­search. “I would like to learn in the fu­ture, though,” she says.</p>
