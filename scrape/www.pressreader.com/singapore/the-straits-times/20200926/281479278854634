    <p>Ac­counts from our cor­re­spon­dents in Sin­ga­pore and around the world</p>
    <p>A dream holiday to Europe that a fam­ily had planned for six months turned out to be a night­mare which they are grate­ful to have sur­vived.</p>
    <p>Three days af­ter the Ng-Chans re­turned on March 21, hav­ing can­celled two stops be­cause of the loom­ing pan­demic, three fam­ily mem­bers fell ill with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ce­line Ng-Chan, a 31-yearold tu­ition teacher who was 10 weeks preg­nant, found out she had Covid-19 af­ter go­ing to see a doc­tor for a sore throat. That night, her two-year-old daugh­ter, Ald­rina, came down with a fever as well.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Mrs Ng-Chan learnt later that her mother, Madam Choy Wai Chee, 58, had also fallen ill and col­lapsed ear­lier that same day.</p>
    <p>Only Mrs Ng-Chan’s hus­band, 32, and her fa­ther, 62, es­caped in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>At one point, when Madam Choy’s con­di­tion de­te­ri­o­rated, doc­tors pre­pared the fam­ily for the worst.</p>
    <p>She was hos­pi­talised for four months at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH), spend­ing 29 days on a life-sup­port ma­chine that took over the func­tion of her heart and kid­neys.</p>
    <p>That was the long­est any Covid-19 pa­tient has been on ex­tra­cor­po­real mem­brane oxy­gena­tion (ECMO) in Sin­ga­pore. Madam Choy was also NUH’s long­est-stay­ing Covid-19 pa­tient, said an NUH spokesman.</p>
    <p>“I feel very heng (lucky i n Hokkien) that I’m still alive. I still haven’t played enough with my grand­daugh­ter yet,” said Madam Choy, an of­fice man­ager. Her daugh­ter Ce­line is also due to give birth next month, she pointed out.</p>
    <p>“It’s like get­ting a sec­ond chance at life, a new life. I re­ally trea­sure my life now.” Madam Choy also has three sons, aged 19 to 29, none of whom be­came ill.</p>
    <p>She was case 738 of the nearly 58,000 peo­ple who have tested pos­i­tive for the virus here to date since the first case was con­firmed on Jan 23. The vast ma­jor­ity were for­eign work­ers liv­ing i n dor­mi­to­ries, where the virus quickly spread.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 27 peo­ple here have died of com­pli­ca­tions re­lated to the dis­ease, while an­other 15 pa­tients who tested pos­i­tive for the virus died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The or­deal for Mrs Ng-Chan, her hus­band, her daugh­ter and her par­ents be­gan af­ter they came home from their fam­ily holiday to London and Paris. They had planned to visit Rome and Barcelona as well, but can­celled the Ital­ian and Span­ish stops as Mrs Ng-Chan felt it was un­wise to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>The last week of their trip was spent holed up in a London be­dand-break­fast which they left only to buy food.</p>
    <p>She and Ald­rina were ad­mit­ted to NUH as cases 739 and 759. They were given the same room.</p>
    <p>“At least I could take care of her,” said Mrs Ng-Chan. “We tried to sleep our days away.”</p>
    <p>Nei­ther be­came very ill, and they were dis­charged 21/ weeks later</p>
    <p>2 when they had neg­a­tive tests for the virus.</p>
    <p>Although she was wor­ried about her early-stage preg­nancy, which only her hus­band knew about then, what made her sick with fear and anx­i­ety was her mother’s con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>“I broke down when I heard that my mum had a 30 per cent chance of dy­ing. I was very afraid of los­ing her,” she said.</p>
    <p>As Madam Choy has a curved spine, which makes her hunch, her lungs do not ex­pand as well as they should and are less able to cope with the dis­ease, said Dr See Kay Choong, NUH’s head of the Di­vi­sion of Res­pi­ra­tory and Crit­i­cal Care Medicine.</p>
    <p>At one point, her liver, heart and kid­neys mal­func­tioned and she be­gan to bleed con­tin­u­ously from the nu­mer­ous tubes in­serted into her body.</p>
    <p>What added to Mrs Ng-Chan’s an­guish was that she could not visit her mother, even though they were in the same hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>A few days af­ter Mrs Ng-Chan was dis­charged in April, her grand­mother died fol­low­ing a short ill­ness at the age of 83.</p>
    <p>She could not go to the fu­neral be­cause of the cap on the num­ber of peo­ple at a wake dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, although she be­lieves</p>
    <p>I feel very heng (lucky in Hokkien) that I’m still alive. I still haven’t played enough with my grand­daugh­ter yet... It’s like get­ting a sec­ond chance at life, a new life. I re­ally trea­sure my life now.</p>
    <p>MADAM CHOY WAI CHEE, who spent 29 days on the ex­tra­cor­po­real mem­brane oxy­gena­tion ma­chine, the long­est time any Covid-19 pa­tient in Sin­ga­pore has spent on it.</p>
    <p>her grand­mother would not have wanted her, be­ing preg­nant, to at­tend it.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan said: “I never prop­erly grieved my grand­mother’s death un­til I went with my mother to pay re­spects at the niche. I bawled my eyes out.”</p>
    <p>Madam Choy her­self was crit­i­cally ill in the in­ten­sive care unit when her mother died, and learnt about her death only a month later.</p>
    <p>She said with tears in her eyes: “I was shocked. I couldn’t be­lieve it un­til I saw pic­tures of the fu­neral. Why didn’t my mother wait for me (to see her be­fore she died)?”</p>
    <p>Madam Choy was dis­charged at the end of July and she has gone back to work as an of­fice man­ager, but the virus has taken its toll.</p>
    <p>She lost 9kg, and now weighs 43kg. She will have to use a non-in­va­sive ven­ti­la­tion ma­chine to help her breathe when she sleeps for the rest of her life. She is also un­der­go­ing phys­io­ther­apy to help her re­gain strength in her limbs.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily do not know how or where they were in­fected.</p>
    <p>On top of that, Mrs Ng-Chan also had to con­tend with an­gry ne­ti­zens, who crit­i­cised her for go­ing on holiday af­ter she wrote an emo­tional post en­cour­ag­ing par­ents to keep their chil­dren at home and not com­plain when the schools were closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>In her post, she wrote about the pain of watch­ing her daugh­ter suf­fer the Covid-19 treat­ment, which in­vited the back­lash.</p>
    <p>She said: “I tuned out all those peo­ple crit­i­cis­ing me for trav­el­ling to fo­cus on par­ents who were wor­ried about their chil­dren get­ting Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Her rea­son for the post, she said, was to share in­for­ma­tion with par­ents from her ex­pe­ri­ence hav­ing a child with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan is im­mensely thank­ful that her whole fam­ily sur­vived the virus, but she has had to fight the feel­ings of guilt about the holiday, es­pe­cially while her mother lay gravely ill.</p>
    <p>She said the fam­ily had con­sid­ered can­celling. But they went as China, not Europe, was the epi­cen­tre of the virus and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion had not de­clared it a pan­demic when they de­cided to go ahead with their travel plans.</p>
    <p>Both Mrs Ng-Chan and her mother want to pay trib­ute to the care they got at NUH.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ng-Chan said: “The health­care staff were re­ally my pil­lar of sup­port. They took care of Ald­rina like she was their own child.”</p>
    <p>While the whole episode has been a roller-coaster ride of emo­tions, it is not with­out a sil­ver lin­ing.</p>
    <p>She said: “I cher­ish fam­ily ties and my hus­band a lot more now. I spend more time with my par­ents and I also feel closer to God.”</p>
