    <p>As China tries to quell the po­lit­i­cal un­rest in</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, the city’s uni­ver­si­ties have be­come po­tent sym­bols of the shrink­ing space for dis­sent or even dis­cus­sion. Po­lit­i­cally ac­tive pro­fes­sors have been fired or de­nied con­tracts, in what they call ret­ri­bu­tion for their crit­i­cism of the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG When Dr Harry Wu, a pro­fes­sor of med­i­cal hu­man­i­ties at the University of Hong Kong, gave a les­son last year about doc­tors’ re­spon­si­bil­i­ties in so­ci­ety, he fo­cused on a real-world ex­am­ple: the vol­un­teer medics treat­ing pro­test­ers and po­lice in the anti-govern­ment demon­stra­tions con­vuls­ing the city.</p>
    <p>But this se­mes­ter, after China im­posed a new na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong, Dr Wu re­worked his les­son plan. He in­cluded pho­tos of the protests in his lec­ture slides, but did not ad­dress them. Be­fore up­load­ing the slides to a university por­tal after class, he deleted the pho­tos al­to­gether. “It’s right in front of your eyes, but you don’t have any op­por­tu­nity to talk about this in class,” he said.</p>
    <p>As China tries to quell the po­lit­i­cal un­rest in Hong Kong, the city’s uni­ver­si­ties have be­come po­tent sym­bols of the shrink­ing space for dis­sent or even dis­cus­sion. Po­lit­i­cally ac­tive pro­fes­sors have been fired or de­nied con­tracts, in what they call ret­ri­bu­tion for their crit­i­cism of the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents are re­quest­ing more se­cure plat­forms for sub­mit­ting as­sign­ments. Schol­ars are re­con­sid­er­ing whether Hong Kong is a vi­able home for their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>The new law, which gives Bei­jing the broad power to crack down on po­lit­i­cal dis­sent, has even al­tered uni­ver­si­ties’ phys­i­cal land­scapes.</p>
    <p>The University of Hong Kong re­cently dis­man­tled a wall of protest posters that stu­dents erected last sum­mer. At the Chi­nese University of Hong Kong, a thicket of barbed wire now en­velops a bridge where clashes had erupted be­tween stu­dents and po­lice.</p>
    <p>Govern­ment of­fi­cials have been open about their in­tent to sub­due the once-free­wheel­ing cam­puses, even as they in­sist that aca­demic free­dom re­mains in­tact.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said last month that the city’s education sec­re­tary would meet university pres­i­dents to dis­cuss how they would roll out the law at their in­sti­tu­tions. “If they no longer have the abil­ity to meet the re­quire­ments, then law en­force­ment of course will have to go in and re­solve it,” she said.</p>
    <p>The scru­tiny is part of a wider cam­paign to con­trol education. Bei­jing’s top of­fi­cial in Hong Kong has called on the govern­ment to bol­ster “pa­tri­otic education”.</p>
    <p>The im­pact on uni­ver­si­ties could be par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant to the govern­ment given their his­tor­i­cal role as in­cu­ba­tors of so­cial move­ments. Stu­dent unions led the months-long pro-democ­racy protests in 2014 known as Oc­cupy</p>
    <p>Cen­tral. The idea of oc­cu­py­ing Cen­tral, the city’s busi­ness dis­trict, was pro­posed by University of Hong Kong law pro­fes­sor Benny Tai, who was fired in July for his in­volve­ment in that move­ment.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents were also among the most de­voted pro­test­ers dur­ing last year’s demon­stra­tions, which were sparked by a now aban­doned Bill that would have al­lowed ex­tra­di­tions to main­land China. Two of the most vi­o­lent con­fronta­tions be­tween pro­test­ers and po­lice un­folded on col­lege cam­puses, in­clud­ing a two-week siege at Hong Kong Polytech­nic University.</p>
    <p>Aca­demics are in­creas­ingly wor­ried about Bei­jing’s in­flu­ence. Even be­fore this year, pro­fes­sors who sup­ported democ­racy were de­nied pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity law, en­acted this sum­mer, specif­i­cally or­ders the govern­ment to in­crease su­pervi</p>
    <p>sion over uni­ver­si­ties. The re­sult is a per­va­sive air of sus­pi­cion. As some fac­ulty and stu­dents feel in­creas­ingly ob­served, they them­selves have turned a more dis­trust­ful eye on their in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has height­ened the un­ease by forc­ing most classes to be held on­line.</p>
    <p>Some stu­dents and pro­fes­sors worry the for­mat leaves them vul­ner­a­ble to sur­veil­lance.</p>
    <p>Some pro­fes­sors have looked out­side the class­room to teach more freely. Since be­ing fired, Prof Tai has be­gun host­ing pri­vate talks on how to de­fend the rule of law.</p>
    <p>“If you do not al­low peo­ple to talk about these sen­si­tive con­cepts in uni­ver­si­ties, in schools, then stu­dents will not just learn from schools and for­mal cur­ricu­lums,” he said. “What we can do is to use so­cial me­dia, civil so­ci­ety, to con­tinue the work.”</p>
