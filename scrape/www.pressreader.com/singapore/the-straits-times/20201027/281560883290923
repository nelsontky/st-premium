    <p>There are moves to re­vive the post of chair­man of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party. This is one of the changes to the top party struc­ture de­signed to strengthen Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s power, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Ben­jamin Kang Lim (be­low).</p>
    <p>• As chair­man of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP), Mao Ze­dong ruled China with an iron fist for nearly 30 years. While the rev­o­lu­tion­ary hero may for­ever be as­so­ci­ated with the slo­gan “the Chi­nese peo­ple have stood up”, with the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China in 1949, he also nearly brought the na­tion to its knees again when his power ran unchecked.</p>
    <p>The Cul­tural Revo­lu­tion (1966-1976) was a reign of ter­ror which saw Chair­man Mao purge his po­lit­i­cal ri­vals, mo­bil­is­ing rad­i­cal youth in po­lit­i­cal cam­paigns marked by hu­mil­i­at­ing “strug­gle ses­sions”, tor­ture, ar­bi­trary ar­rests, killings and sui­cides. One of its vic­tims was Deng Xiaop­ing, who was de­moted from vice-pre­mier to a worker at a trac­tor fac­tory in Jiangxi prov­ince in 1969. Deng con­soled him­self that at least he was able to care for his son who was left a para­plegic af­ter jump­ing out of a build­ing to es­cape a mob of ma­raud­ing Red Guards.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mao’s death in 1976, one of Deng’s acts on re­turn­ing to power was to abol­ish the post of party chair­man in 1982, to avoid a re­peat of the Great Helms­man’s de­mented ex­cesses and the cult of personalit­y that en­abled them.</p>
    <p>Deng sought to dif­fuse power through a sys­tem of col­lec­tive lead­er­ship – em­bod­ied in the party gen­eral sec­re­tary and the Polit­buro Stand­ing Com­mit­tee. He also in­tro­duced a pe­cu­liar un­writ­ten rule in which he named his hand­picked heir’s suc­ces­sor – a move that was tan­ta­mount to im­pos­ing a term limit on the gen­eral sec­re­tary who had to even­tu­ally pass on the man­tle.</p>
    <p>That suc­ces­sion sys­tem Deng put in place is deemed ob­so­lete to­day. And Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping looks set to cre­ate a new one more in keep­ing with the times.</p>
    <p>The CCP in­tends to res­ur­rect the post of chair­man at the party’s 20th congress in 2022 and make other moves that would fur­ther tighten Pres­i­dent Xi’s grip on power, two sources with ties to the Chi­nese lead­er­ship told The Straits Times, re­quest­ing anonymity. They noted that while Deng es­chewed for­mal ti­tles as head of state or the CCP, he was the power be­hind the throne; Mr Xi, on the other hand, is choos­ing to be more trans­par­ent on who is the one wield­ing ul­ti­mate power in China.</p>
    <p>Other ma­jor changes in the works by an ad hoc com­mit­tee in­clude a re­struc­tur­ing of the CCP’s top ech­e­lons and bend­ing the cus­tom­ary re­tire­ment age.</p>
    <p>The party’s elite Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, which is hold­ing its fifth plenum from Oct 26 to 29, is ex­pected to en­dorse the broad out­lines of the ad hoc com­mit­tee’s work on th­ese in­ter­nal changes. Given the CCP’s opaque ways and ob­ses­sion with se­crecy, the de­tails of the re­struc­tur­ing will not be for­mally un­veiled to the pub­lic un­til the 20th congress.</p>
    <p>But it is un­der­stood that the changes would in­volve re­in­stat­ing one to three vice-chair­man po­si­tions, shrink­ing the cur­rent seven-mem­ber Polit­buro Stand­ing Com­mit­tee to five or even three. Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang is tipped to be­come head of Par­lia­ment in</p>
    <p>2023, but it is not clear at this junc­ture if he will be­come a party vice-chair­man and con­cur­rently a stand­ing com­mit­tee mem­ber.</p>
    <p>It is also un­clear at this stage if the post of gen­eral sec­re­tary would be scrapped to make way for the re­vived post of party chair­man. But it is un­likely that Mr Xi would hold both po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>The up­shot: Power will be fur­ther con­cen­trated in the hands of Mr Xi and a hand­ful of party lead­ers. The changes are driven by sev­eral im­per­a­tives. Th­ese in­clude the grow­ing strate­gic power ri­valry with the United States as well as the need to ac­com­mo­date ri­val po­lit­i­cal fac­tions, party sources say.</p>
    <p>“China needs a po­lit­i­cal strong­man at this junc­ture to deal with an in­creas­ingly hos­tile US,” a source with ties to the Chi­nese lead­er­ship told ST.</p>
    <p>STEADY HAND NEEDED</p>
    <p>The think­ing be­hind the re­design of the top power struc­ture is that China needs an ex­pe­ri­enced and steady pair of hands to guide the na­tion at this crit­i­cal junc­ture. Apart from hav­ing to con­front a hos­tile US, it also faces a fun­da­men­tal re­struc­tur­ing of an econ­omy still vul­ner­a­ble af­ter the dev­as­tat­ing blow of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the chal­lenges posed by en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion, in­come dis­par­i­ties and an age­ing pop­u­la­tion, not to men­tion the never-end­ing bat­tle against cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>In short, it would be too risky to change horses mid-stream. “Xi can­not (step) down. A younger leader would lack ex­pe­ri­ence and not be able to fend off US pres­sure,” a po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor who writes un­der the pseu­do­nym Lan Jiang said last week, re­fer­ring to in­creas­ingly fraught re­la­tions with Wash­ing­ton, with both coun­tries cross­ing swords over a length­en­ing list of is­sues in­clud­ing the coro­n­avirus, trade, tech­nol­ogy, Tai­wan, Ti­bet, Hong Kong, Xin­jiang and the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi has ac­cu­mu­lated more ti­tles than any of his re­cent pre­de­ces­sors since com­ing to power in 2012. Other than pres­i­dent, gen­eral sec­re­tary and Cen­tral Mil­i­tary Com­mis­sion chair­man, he is also be­ing re­ferred to as the party’s “core” and the “peo­ple’s leader”. But he has yet to ac­quire two of Mao’s ti­tles: chair­man and “great leader”. He is un­likely to be re­ferred to as the “great leader”, which is re­served ex­clu­sively for Mao.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Mr Xi’s hold on power was strength­ened when China’s Par­lia­ment amended the Con­sti­tu­tion, scrap­ping the two-term limit on the pres­i­dency, thereby al­low­ing him to stay on in the post in­def­i­nitely if he so chooses.</p>
    <p>As party gen­eral sec­re­tary, Mr Xi is first among equals in the stand­ing com­mit­tee but in real terms he is po­lit­i­cally stronger than his pre­de­ces­sors ex­cept for Mao and, ar­guably, Deng.</p>
    <p>“Xi is gen­eral sec­re­tary in name, but al­ready wields power close to that of a party chair­man,” said Pro­fes­sor Wang Hsin-hsien, a</p>
    <p>China ex­pert at Tai­wan’s Na­tional Chengchi Univer­sity. “If he be­comes party chair­man, he will have the fi­nal say when­ever there are dif­fer­ences of opin­ion.”</p>
    <p>Signs that there will be ma­jor changes in the top power struc­tures could be gleaned from Mr Xi’s call for “en­hanc­ing top-level de­sign” – com­mu­nist jar­gon for re­form of the party’s top ech­e­lons – dur­ing an in­spec­tion tour of Hu­nan prov­ince last month.</p>
    <p>The fact that Mr Xi made the call in Hu­nan, Mao’s birth­place, lent weight to the read­ing by party in­sid­ers that one of the changes would in­volve the re­vival of the party chair­man­ship, with Mr Xi as­sum­ing the post.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s call, it should be noted, was not the first by a Chi­nese leader. His im­me­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Hu Jin­tao, coined the phrase “top-level de­sign” dur­ing the wan­ing years of his sec­ond five-year term, but what­ever changes that were con­tem­plated then were never im­ple­mented or made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed, Mr Xi would be the party’s fourth chair­man since the 1949 revo­lu­tion and Mao’s true heir.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mao died, Hua Guofeng be­came party chair­man but he was out­ma­noeu­vred by Deng in in­ter­nal power strug­gles. Be­tween 1980 and 1982, Deng re­placed Hua as Cen­tral Mil­i­tary Com­mis­sion chair­man and gave Hua’s two other posts – party chair­man and pre­mier – to other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Deng ap­pointed one of his pro­teges, Hu Yaobang, as party chair­man in 1981, but Hu re­lin­quished the post the fol­low­ing year and set­tled for the po­si­tion of gen­eral sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>“Mao was the first-gen­er­a­tion (party chair­man). Hua Guofeng and Hu Yaobang’s terms (as chair­men) were too short,’’ said a party source. Mr Xi’s el­e­va­tion to the top po­si­tion would make him ef­fec­tively the sec­ond-gen­er­a­tion chair­man and true heir to Mao.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi has lofty am­bi­tions for China, in­clud­ing mak­ing the coun­try great again and even­tu­ally re­uni­fy­ing with self-ruled demo­cratic Tai­wan, which Bei­jing claims as its own. The bold­ness of his vi­sions re­in­forces the ar­gu­ment that term lim­its should be lifted as he would need more than 10 years to re­alise th­ese goals.</p>
    <p>Given his track record, few po­lit­i­cal elites could, or dare, ar­gue against Mr Xi serv­ing a third and pos­si­bly fourth five-year term at the helm of the party which, ac­cord­ing to the coun­try’s Con­sti­tu­tion, “leads ev­ery­thing”.</p>
    <p>While the Covid-19 pan­demic broke out in China un­der his watch, Mr Xi’s de­ci­sion to im­pose harsh mea­sures, in­clud­ing a pro­longed lock­down of a prov­ince of al­most 60 mil­lion peo­ple, was in­stru­men­tal in China be­ing able to get back on its feet rapidly, cer­tainly much faster than the US and other Western coun­tries still grap­pling with a resur­gence of the out­break.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s sweep­ing crack­down on cor­rup­tion is part of his pledge to im­prove “party build­ing”, or good gov­er­nance, but crit­ics say it has been se­lec­tive, tar­get­ing po­lit­i­cal ri­vals. A risk taker, Mr Xi has no qualms about mak­ing en­e­mies. More than one mil­lion party, gov­ern­ment and mil­i­tary of­fi­cials and their busi­ness cronies have been en­snared in the clam­p­down.</p>
    <p>AGE LIMIT</p>
    <p>Mr Xi has also shown a will­ing­ness to depart from norms which he con­sid­ers ar­bi­trary or serv­ing no good pur­pose. The ex­pec­ta­tion among party in­sid­ers is that he is also likely to bend another un­writ­ten rule which calls for of­fi­cials to step down at 68, to al­low a se­lect group of high-per­form­ing loy­al­ists to stay on.</p>
    <p>The rule was bent in 2018 when Mr Wang Qis­han, who had re­tired from the Polit­buro Stand­ing Com­mit­tee, was made state vice-pres­i­dent at the age of 70.</p>
    <p>If the age limit is set aside again in 2022, one ben­e­fi­ciary is likely to be Vice-Pre­mier Han Zheng, who will be 68 then. Mr Han is close to for­mer pres­i­dent Jiang Zemin. Hav­ing him stay on in the stand­ing com­mit­tee would be one way to keep the Shang­hai Gang, a po­lit­i­cal fac­tion headed by Mr Jiang, on­side.</p>
    <p>Another likely ben­e­fi­ciary is Mr Chen Xi, who heads the party’s or­gan­i­sa­tion depart­ment over­see­ing the pro­mo­tion and de­mo­tion of cadres. Mr Chen, who be­longs to Pres­i­dent Xi’s fac­tion dubbed the “Xi Fam­ily Army”, will be 69 in 2022.</p>
    <p>Pre­mier Li, who be­longs to a fac­tion headed by for­mer pres­i­dent Hu Jin­tao, will be 67 in 2022 and is tech­ni­cally el­i­gi­ble to stay on in the stand­ing com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Many Western me­dia out­lets have painted Pres­i­dent Xi as a dic­ta­tor with an in­sa­tiable ap­petite for power. The ac­qui­si­tion of the chair­man ti­tle would likely re­in­force fears that China is headed down the Mao route again, with power held tightly in the hands of one man who, in his dotage, could ruin the lives of mil­lions with un­wise de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>But the changes in the power struc­ture may not nec­es­sar­ily go down that path. The stream­lin­ing of the stand­ing com­mit­tee could be read as one way to avoid fac­tion­al­ism at the top; that in time, China could re­turn to col­lec­tive lead­er­ship with Mr Xi’s most trusted po­lit­i­cal al­lies hold­ing key po­si­tions and tak­ing more of the bur­den of run­ning the coun­try from him.</p>
    <p>It will be fool­hardy to try to de­ci­pher China’s fu­ture from the present volatile cir­cum­stances. But what is clear is that Mr Xi has no de­sire to copy Western lib­eral democ­racy. He is still re­shap­ing the Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal model, which has so far helped China de­feat the coro­n­avirus but is still sub­ject to myr­iad chal­lenges both in­ter­nally and ex­ter­nally. Only time will tell if Mr Xi will prove to be more adept than Mao.</p>
