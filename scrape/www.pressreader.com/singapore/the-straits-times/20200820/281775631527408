    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts have crit­i­cised the un­so­licited in­volve­ment of In­done­sia’s in­tel­li­gence unit (BIN) and army in ef­forts to find a cure for Covid-19, say­ing the as­so­ci­ated clin­i­cal tri­als breached in­ter­na­tional pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>This came after army chief Gen­eral Andika Perkasa an­nounced on Satur­day that In­done­sia was gear­ing up to pro­duce drugs to fight the coro­n­avirus and he ex­pected BPOM, the In­done­sian equiv­a­lent of the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion, to au­tho­rise three com­bi­na­tions of ex­ist­ing drugs that he claimed could cure Covid-19.</p>
    <p>BIN’s sec­re­tary, Gen­eral Bam­bang Su­nar­wi­bowo, told MetroTV on Tues­day night that his agency started the en­deav­our in March – rop­ing in re­searchers at Air­langga Uni­ver­sity – out of con­cerns caused by the high fa­tal­ity rate and fast spread of the virus in In­done­sia and that BIN was fund­ing the project.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to doc­tors who were per­plexed by the in­volve­ment of an in­tel­li­gence agency in a med­i­cal en­deav­our, Gen Bam­bang said: “We ini­ti­ated it. BIN is part of the govern­ment. The re­search was con­ducted by Air­langga Uni­ver­sity, which is work­ing with BIN, the army and sev­eral hos­pi­tals.”</p>
    <p>Air­langga Uni­ver­sity and BIN first an­nounced they dis­cov­ered five com­bi­na­tions of drugs to fight Covid-19 in June. In the en­su­ing clin­i­cal tri­als, they ap­plied three of these five com­bi­na­tions. The three com­bi­na­tions are lopinavir/ri­ton­avir and azithromyc­in, lopinavir/ri­ton­avir and doxy­cy­cline, and hy­drochloro­quine and azithromyc­in.</p>
    <p>In a pre­sen­ta­tion re­port about its clin­i­cal trial, the Air­langga Uni­ver­sity said the drugs un­der trial showed their ef­fi­cacy after three to seven days of ad­min­is­ter­ing, stress­ing that as­sess­ment of kid­ney, liver and heart func­tion later proved to be nor­mal.</p>
    <p>The tri­als were con­ducted be­tween July 7 and Aug 4. Of the 1,127 sub­jects who par­tic­i­pated in the ini­tial stage, 754 qual­i­fied after meet­ing the in­clu­sion cri­te­ria, ac­cord­ing to the 16-page re­port seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers have to spec­ify in­clu­sion and ex­clu­sion cri­te­ria for par­tic­i­pa­tion in ev­ery clin­i­cal trial, fac­tor­ing in the par­tic­i­pants’ age, sex and pre­vi­ous med­i­cal his­tory.</p>
    <p>An­tara, the state news agency, re­ported on Tues­day that Dr Pandu Riono, who teaches at the Uni­ver­sity of In­done­sia’s med­i­cal school, took is­sue with the con­sor­tium’s fail­ure to sub­mit the re­port of its clin­i­cal trial to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) In­ter­na­tional Clin­i­cal Tri­als Registry Plat­form, so it could be ac­cessed for trans­parency by aca­demics and re­searchers world­wide.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, BIN’s Gen Bam­bang said they did not in­tend to con­ceal any­thing and that in­puts and crit­i­cism from oth­ers are, in fact, very good. “It is im­por­tant to think pos­i­tively, so In­done­sia would re­ally have an anti-Covid-19 drug. This would ad­dress all the prob­lems we are fac­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the process was mon­i­tored by BPOM, but not ev­ery step of it was dis­closed to the public.</p>
    <p>The WHO’s registry plat­form serves to en­sure a com­plete view of re­search is ac­ces­si­ble to all those in­volved in health­care de­ci­sion-mak­ing. “This will im­prove re­search trans­parency and will ul­ti­mately strengthen the va­lid­ity and value of the sci­en­tific ev­i­dence base,” ac­cord­ing to WHO.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion on the plat­form re­quires doc­u­ment­ing the ob­jec­tives, de­sign and method­ol­ogy of a trial, as well as pro­vid­ing back­ground and ra­tio­nale.</p>
    <p>Trial par­tic­i­pants must be ran­domly se­lected and rep­re­sent var­i­ous groups to re­duce bias.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­teers in the Air­langga Uni­ver­sity’s trial came from Se­capa, the army’s of­fi­cer can­di­date school.</p>
    <p>The school was a 1,300-case coro­n­avirus clus­ter, in­volv­ing stu­dents, staff and stu­dents’ rel­a­tives. Those in­fected stayed in a dor­mi­tory in Ban­dung, the coun­try’s fifth most pop­u­lous city. Of the to­tal 1,200 stu­dents, 991 got in­fected. Al­most all were young men, aged be­tween 20 and 23.</p>
    <p>Dr Pandu said in­clud­ing asymp­tomatic sub­jects in the trial was a breach of pro­ce­dure, since asymp­tomatic cases need rest, vi­ta­mins and self-iso­la­tion, rather than drugs.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Zubairi Djo­er­ban, head of the In­done­sian Doc­tors As­so­ci­a­tion’s coro­n­avirus task force, said on MetroTV on Tues­day night that the Air­langga Uni­ver­sity should have sought peer re­views on its study first be­fore any an­nounce­ment to the public.</p>
    <p>In an ap­par­ent move to pre-empt public con­fu­sion, the Na­tional Covid-19 task force is­sued a state­ment late on Tues­day night, cit­ing Pro­fes­sor Ali Ghufron Mukti, head of the govern­ment’s Covid-19 re­search and i nno­va­tion con­sor­tium, who said: “Up to now, there is no spe­cific drug that cures Covid-19.”</p>
