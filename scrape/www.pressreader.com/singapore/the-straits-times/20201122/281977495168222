    <p>Tampines res­i­dents will soon be able to grow their own or­ganic veg­eta­bles for per­sonal con­sump­tion in a cleaner, more ef­fi­cient way.</p>
    <p>Rather than the tra­di­tional method of plant­ing in soil, Our Tampines Hub is of­fer­ing res­i­dents ver­ti­cal hy­dro­ponic kits that can be used to grow veg­gies at home, it an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The struc­ture – about 1m wide and just un­der 2m high – can ac­com­mo­date about 20 plants.</p>
    <p>A pi­lot pro­ject will see about 50 kits be­ing given free to res­i­dents whose homes are suit­able, such as those with enough sun­light.</p>
    <p>The scheme is part of an ini­tia­tive called Our Green Hut, which also in­volves start­ing a ver­ti­cal hy­dro­ponic farm to pro­duce more than 15 types of veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>Mr Masagos Zulkifli, a Tampines GRC MP, told re­porters at the launch event: “The big­ger plan is to ac­tu­ally grow food within Tampines. We are re­leas­ing some carpark rooftop gar­dens that will not just be pro­duc­ing veg­eta­bles, but also for res­i­dents to get in­volved in grow­ing a com­mer­cially vi­able rooftop gar­den.”</p>
    <p>About 600 Tampines res­i­dents have in­di­cated in­ter­est in the ver­ti­cal hy­dro­ponic pro­ject.</p>
    <p>“This is only the be­gin­ning,” said Mr Masagos, who is the Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment. “We don’t want this to be a one-time en­deav­our and then they throw the equip­ment away.</p>
    <p>“We want them to prove that they want to do this as a con­tin­u­ous en­deav­our to grow food at home, start­ing with sim­ple veg­eta­bles, and then maybe later on with more dif­fi­cult ones.”</p>
    <p>This also feeds into the big­ger aim of Sin­ga­pore meet­ing 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs by 2030, a plan that has been brought for­ward due to the coron­avirus cri­sis, Mr Masagos noted.</p>
    <p>“We must also get in­volved in un­der­stand­ing what we need to grow food at home, so that our chil­dren un­der­stand the tech­nol­ogy in­volved... as well as the pro­duc­tion and the growth,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Min Choo, 64, a re­tired air traf­fic ser­vice of­fi­cer and a vol­un­teer at Our Tampines Hub, is one of the first res­i­dents to start grow­ing veg­eta­bles like chye sim</p>
    <p>GROW­ING UN­DER­STAND­ING</p>
    <p>We must also get in­volved in un­der­stand­ing what we need to grow food at home, so that our chil­dren un­der­stand the tech­nol­ogy in­volved... as well as the pro­duc­tion and the growth. ’’</p>
    <p>TAMPINES GRC MP MASAGOS ZULKIFLI, on the pi­lot pro­ject that of­fers res­i­dents ver­ti­cal hy­dro­ponic kits that can be used to grow veg­eta­bles at home.</p>
    <p>us­ing the ver­ti­cal hy­dro­ponic kit.</p>
    <p>The struc­ture was in­stalled on her bal­cony about a month ago ahead of the pi­lot pro­ject. She said: “I used to live in a kam­pung, so I have al­ways liked plant­ing veg­eta­bles and I thought there was no harm try­ing some­thing new.”</p>
    <p>The kit en­sures nu­tri­ent-filled wa­ter is cir­cu­lated in­ter­nally, so Ms Tan does not have to wa­ter the plants daily but just mon­i­tors the nu­tri­ent level us­ing a me­ter ev­ery few days, adding nu­tri­ents or wa­ter if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The plants take about three weeks to har­vest.</p>
    <p>“This kit makes grow­ing veg­eta­bles so clean, whereas soil can be dirty and dusty. It also saves space be­cause of the ver­ti­cal set-up,” she added.</p>
