    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK For the time be­ing, all the polls seem to be go­ing Mr Joe Bi­den’s way ahead of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But gam­blers see a dif­fer­ent re­al­ity and are putting their money on Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. The Repub­li­can in­cum­bent, who is seek­ing a sec­ond term, has slowly climbed back in the polls since late July to nearly even with the Demo­cratic for­mer vi­cepres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>For some Aus­tralian and Bri­tish book­mak­ers, Mr Trump is the odds-on favourite. Bet­ting on na­tional or lo­cal elec­tions is il­le­gal in the United States. All the ac­tion is hap­pen­ing on for­eign gam­bling sites – which Amer­i­cans can some­times ac­cess.</p>
    <p>A US$100 (S$136) wa­ger on a Trump win to­day could bring the punter a re­turn of US$190 if he notches the vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“There is no doubt that the mo­men­tum ap­pears to have swung back into Pres­i­dent Trump’s favour,” said Mr Ru­pert Adams, a spokesman for Bri­tish book­maker William Hill, which has al­ready ac­cepted more than US$1.3 mil­lion in elec­tion bets.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Price, a spokesman for Ir­ish gam­bling brand Paddy Power, said that af­ter a slow­down in bet­ting ac­tiv­ity due to the coron­avirus cri­sis, in­ter­est has “started to pick up again in re­cent weeks”.</p>
    <p>“We think the Trump fac­tor is sure to keep pun­ters in­ter­ested,” Mr Price said.</p>
    <p>Many who have placed their bets on Mr Trump are hop­ing for a re­peat of 2016, when the Man­hat­tan real es­tate mogul staged a stun­ning come­back against Demo­cratic chal­lenger Hil­lary Clin­ton to win the White House.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish book­maker Bet­fair has taken in £10 mil­lion (S$18 mil­lion) in bets on the White House race since Aug 23, the eve of the Repub­li­can nom­i­nat­ing con­ven­tion. That brings their to­tal so far to £72 mil­lion, against £33 mil­lion at the same point in the cam­paign in 2016.</p>
    <p>Bet­fair is hop­ing to top the record of £199 mil­lion wa­gered in 2016, half of which came af­ter polling sta­tions closed, said spokesman Dar­ren Hughes.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the main event, Paddy Power is tak­ing bets on some quirky is­sues: will Mr Trump paint the White House gold (500-1)? Will he have an air­port in Mex­ico named af­ter him (66-1)?</p>
    <p>But Mr Price said the in­ter­est in those types of bets has waned a bit. “Trump is less wacky, quirky, and funny,” Mr Price said, call­ing the Pres­i­dent’s cur­rent be­hav­iour “just plain scary”.</p>
    <p>Mr Matthew Collins, a 29-year-old Aus­tralian sales con­sul­tant, placed 21 sep­a­rate bets be­fore the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion – nearly all of them on Mr Trump. He not only picked the Pres­i­dent to win again in Novem­ber, but also as the win­ner of sev­eral spe­cific states.</p>
    <p>In all, he put down about A$20,000 (S$19,900) – a sum he won on a bet that Mr Bi­den would choose Ms Ka­mala Har­ris as his run­ning mate.</p>
    <p>Mr Collins, who de­scribed him­self as po­lit­i­cally left-lean­ing, felt that Mr Trump has gained mo­men­tum since his party’s con­ven­tion late month, which came on the heels of the Democrats’ event.</p>
    <p>Mr Nick Freil­ing, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of a mar­ket re­search firm, has bet US$300 on a Trump vic­tory in tra­di­tion­ally Demo­cratic Min­nesota. He said it is nor­mal for the gap be­tween the can­di­dates to nar­row as the elec­tion ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>The coron­avirus cri­sis is an­other ma­jor fac­tor, he said – Mr Trump faced sharp crit­i­cism for his han­dling of the pan­demic, but the is­sue “is steadily fall­ing out of our pub­lic con­scious­ness, and peo­ple are less an­gry about things, gen­er­ally”.</p>
    <p>For Mr Freil­ing, “the polls may be of ‘likely vot­ers’ and show Bi­den win­ning”. He added: But what about vot­ers’ en­thu­si­asm for their can­di­date (which cor­re­lates with turnout)? Trump is win­ning that bat­tle by huge mar­gins.”</p>
    <p>“Watch where the money goes,” Mr Collins said, pre­dict­ing that Mr Trump will dom­i­nate his three de­bates with Mr Bi­den. “That’s what peo­ple re­ally care about.” Those with skin in the bet­ting game are also keep­ing an eye on the likely mas­sive pro­por­tion of votes cast by mail this year, due to coron­avirus con­cerns – a po­ten­tial game changer. “That feels like a sit­u­a­tion that could get very messy,” Mr Collins said.</p>
    <p>VOT­ERS’ EN­THU­SI­ASM</p>
    <p>The polls may be of ‘likely vot­ers’ and show Bi­den win­ning. But what about vot­ers’ en­thu­si­asm for their can­di­date (which cor­re­lates with turnout)? Trump is win­ning that bat­tle by huge mar­gins.</p>
