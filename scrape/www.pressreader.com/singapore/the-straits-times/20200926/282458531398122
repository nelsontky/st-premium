    <p>New Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) pres­i­dent Lien Choong Luen has vowed to re­pay the faith shown in him and his team, who were voted into power by an em­phatic mar­gin at the fra­ter­nity’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing last night.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral man­ager of ride-hail­ing app Go­jek de­feated lawyer Ed­mond Pereira 14-3 at the track and field body’s elec­tions at the Nexus Au­di­to­rium in Cup­page Plaza.</p>
    <p>Lien’s en­tire nine-man slate was also voted into the man­age­ment com­mit­tee, with each of them re­ceiv­ing at least 14 of the 17 valid votes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the po­si­tion each elected mem­ber will take up on the MC will be con­firmed only af­ter its first meet­ing. There will also be two non-elected mem­bers of the com­mit­tee: the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and an ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive.</p>
    <p>Lien, 43, said he and his team were “hum­bled and very grate­ful” by the back­ing they re­ceived from the af­fil­i­ates, but said he was un­der no il­lu­sions about the dif­fi­cul­ties they face in re­viv­ing the ail­ing sport.</p>
    <p>“There’s re­ally strong sup­port for the work we’ve done and the po­ten­tial for the plans we’ve out­lined,” he</p>
    <p>There’s re­ally strong sup­port for the work we’ve done and the po­ten­tial for the plans we’ve out­lined. But re­ally, as I’ve told my team, talk is cheap. Now is the time for us to de­liver on what we have promised to do.</p>
    <p>noted. “But re­ally, as I’ve told my team, talk is cheap.</p>
    <p>“Now is the time for us to de­liver on what we have promised to do.”</p>
    <p>In the lead-up to the elec­tions, Lien’s team an­nounced they had se­cured $100,000 in do­na­tions to get</p>
    <p>their plans go­ing if voted into power.</p>
    <p>Th­ese plans – cov­er­ing ac­cess and de­vel­op­ment sup­port, com­pe­ti­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties, ath­lete man­age­ment and strength­en­ing gov­er­nance – in­clude turn­ing in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing into re­gional train­ing cen­tres, and pro­vid­ing coaches for ath­letes from schools that do not fo­cus on ath­let­ics, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>For Pereira, 70, a stal­wart of the lo­cal scene, last night’s de­feat meant he has now lost the bid for the SA top job four times, af­ter pre­vi­ous de­feats in 1984, 2000 and 2016.</p>
    <p>Crest­fallen, he said: “There’s not</p>
    <p>much to say, the af­fil­i­ates have spo­ken.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully they (the fra­ter­nity) will have the ob­jec­tive to move the sport for­ward. Time will tell.”</p>
    <p>But he may yet have a part to play as Lien said he planned to meet Pereira soon to ex­plore how he can “get the best of ev­ery­body’s ef­forts” in mov­ing the sport for­ward.</p>
    <p>SA is cur­rently in­volved in le­gal pro­ceed­ings with two-time SEA Games marathon gold medal­list Soh Rui Yong over com­ments made re­gard­ing his omis­sion from the 2019 Games.</p>
    <p>Aside from the court pro­ceed­ings, the fra­ter­nity has pro­duced neg­a­tive head­lines in re­cent years</p>
    <p>over nu­mer­ous in­ter­nal spats.</p>
    <p>The dishar­mony has af­fected ath­letes’ per­for­mances, as seen in last year’s SEA Games, when the team failed to win a single gold medal at the bi­en­nial meet for the first time since 1991.</p>
    <p>In his farewell mes­sage to the com­mu­nity, out­go­ing pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei, who had de­clined to stand again, noted this, say­ing: “We are fall­ing be­hind our neigh­bours, and this is a wake-up call not just for the as­so­ci­a­tion, but for the coaches and ath­letes as well.”</p>
    <p>He added: “SAA’s priority should al­ways be our ath­letes.”</p>
