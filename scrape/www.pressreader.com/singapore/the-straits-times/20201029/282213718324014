    <p>Chip­maker STMi­cro­elec­tron­ics will open a cut­ting-edge re­search and devel­op­ment (R&D) line at its man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­ity in Sin­ga­pore, in a three-way pub­lic-pri­vate tie-up an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 1,300 sq m clean­room, which will fo­cus on piezo­elec­tric mi­cro­elec­trome­chan­i­cal sys­tem (piezo Mems) tech­nol­ogy, is ex­pected to pro­duce its first wafers in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year, and scale up to higher-vol­ume pro­duc­tion by end-2022.</p>
    <p>STMi­cro also in­di­cated that it is ready to dou­ble the size of the clean­room if needed.</p>
    <p>The planned fa­cil­ity is a col­lab­o­ra­tion with the In­sti­tute of Mi­cro­elec­tron­ics (IME) at Sin­ga­pore’s Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) and Ja­panese tool ven­dor Ul­vac.</p>
    <p>Mems are tiny in­te­grated sys­tems used in de­vices such as sen­sors and printer heads, and piezo Mems rely on an elec­tric charge gen­er­ated when stress is ap­plied to ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>The out­put from the R&D fa­cil­ity is ex­pected to cut across var­i­ous mar­ket seg­ments, such as smart glasses, healthcare ap­pa­ra­tus and 3D print­ing.</p>
    <p>While STMi­cro’s ana­log, Mems and sen­sors group pres­i­dent Benedetto Vigna would not put a dol­lar amount to the in­vest­ment, he said the value of the ini­tia­tive “is re­ally very high” on the back of fac­tors, such as Sin­ga­pore’s strate­gic lo­ca­tion and the po­ten­tial of piezo Mems tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The lat­est move comes just over a year af­ter STMi­cro un­veiled an en­hanced wafer fab­ri­ca­tion fa­cil­ity at its Ang Mo Kio “techno-park” premises, which took the ca­pac­ity of the group’s Sin­ga­pore op­er­a­tions to 27,500 eight-inch and 84,000 six-inch wafers a week.</p>
    <p>That ex­pan­sion in Septem­ber last year also took the Sin­ga­pore work­force size to about 4,900 staff, but Mr Vigna added that the new fa­cil­ity will fea­ture “sev­eral tens” of new and re­de­ployed Mems R&D per­son­nel, in­clud­ing process sci­en­tists, en­gi­neers and de­sign­ers.</p>
    <p>“We will de­velop prod­ucts for dif­fer­ent mar­kets, we will de­velop prod­ucts for per­sonal elec­tron­ics, for au­to­mo­tive, for in­dus­trial; and then, de­pend­ing on the suc­cess of these prod­ucts, we will staff prop­erly with the op­er­a­tors,” he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Busi­ness Times, Mr Vigna said the up­com­ing “lab in fab” is meant to bridge the gap be­tween pro­to­typ­ing and high-vol­ume pro­duc­tion, which he de­scribed as “one of the tra­di­tional dif­fi­cul­ties of Mems”.</p>
    <p>While the com­pany had pre­vi­ously co-lo­cated Mems R&D and man­u­fac­tur­ing in Italy, he said the Sin­ga­pore site is novel for its col­lab­o­ra­tive ap­proach.</p>
    <p>On top of STMi­cro’s back­ground in high-vol­ume pro­duc­tion, Ul­vac will help to de­velop new tech­no­log­i­cal pro­cesses and more af­ford­able Mems tools, while the IME will work on the de­sign and tech­nol­ogy devel­op­ment for ma­te­ri­als and prod­ucts, Mr Vigna noted.</p>
    <p>IME ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Kwong Dim-Lee said in a state­ment that the project “will con­tinue to an­chor high-value R&D ac­tiv­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore” and demon­strates the Re­pub­lic’s con­tin­ued at­trac­tive­ness as a place for in­dus­try play­ers to in­no­vate and grow.</p>
