    <p>Dr Janet Yellen knows a deep re­ces­sion and a patchy re­cov­ery from the in­side. She will need all that pol­icy prow­ess and a healthy dol­lop of po­lit­i­cal savvy to steer the United States, and by de­fault the rest of the world, through this epic slow­down.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Fed­eral Re­serve chair is Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s pick for Trea­sury Sec­re­tary, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter. She is prob­a­bly the most qual­i­fied per­son to ever hold the post.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen led the cen­tral bank dur­ing the ar­du­ous climb back from the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. She also served as vice-chair, head of the San Fran­cisco Fed, a Fed gov­er­nor and chair of the Coun­cil of Eco­nomic Ad­vis­ers un­der for­mer pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton. This is more than a steady hand in a tough time. It isn’t a stretch to say she will be to eco­nom­ics what Gen­eral Ge­orge Mar­shall – as one-time army chief of staff, sec­re­tary of state and sec­re­tary of de­fence – was to for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Over the past decade, and es­pe­cially dur­ing the nine-month stretch of the coro­n­avirus, top of­fi­cials from Tokyo to Wash­ing­ton have re­peat­edly high­lighted the im­por­tance of fis­cal and mon­e­tary poli­cies work­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen knows the lat­ter in­ti­mately and is about to get a huge say over the for­mer.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter co­or­di­na­tion would not only ac­cel­er­ate the eco­nomic re­cov­ery, but also avert some of the the­atrics that have roiled mar­kets in the wake of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the early days of the pan­demic, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Trea­sury chief Steven Mnuchin worked closely with Fed chair Jerome Pow­ell. But ties be­tween the two men soon frayed. Last week, they found them­selves at log­ger­heads over the con­tin­u­a­tion of the cen­tral bank’s emer­gency lend­ing pro­grammes. (Mr Mnuchin ul­ti­mately won.) This was no mere Belt­way tiff: Mar­kets re­treated world­wide in fear that stim­u­lus would di­min­ish.</p>
    <p>The roles of Trea­sury sec­re­tary and Fed chair are dif­fer­ent but com­ple­men­tary. An un­writ­ten yet cru­cial part of Dr Yellen’s new job de­scrip­tion will be pro­vid­ing cover for the cen­tral bank. The Fed is gen­er­ally leery of di­rectly en­gag­ing on mat­ters that can be seen as par­ti­san.</p>
    <p>As one of the most se­nior Cabi­net of­fi­cials, Dr Yellen will now be right in the fray. She won’t just have to pro­tect the in­sti­tu­tion from Congress, she will also need to make sure Mr Bi­den doesn’t riff on mon­e­tary pol­icy in ways seen as erod­ing in­de­pen­dence. Mr Trump wasn’t the first pres­i­dent to pres­sure the cen­tral bank, but he was the only one in re­cent decades who showed such lit­tle re­spect for in­sti­tu­tional res­traint.</p>
    <p>All this mat­ters greatly for the rest of the world. Amer­ica re­mains the largest econ­omy, and when it comes to the power of cap­i­tal mar­kets and the dol­lar, no­body – not even China – comes close.</p>
    <p>But through­out her term at the pin­na­cle of the Fed, Dr Yellen showed that what hap­pens abroad has di­rect con­se­quences for Amer­i­can cap­i­tal­ism. In 2015, she chose to hold off rais­ing in­ter­est rates amid China’s mar­ket melt­down and a botched at­tempt at de­valu­ing the yuan.</p>
    <p>The Fed tight­ened just once that year, in De­cem­ber, de­spite set­ting out with mul­ti­ple hikes in mind.</p>
    <p>When she was Mr Clin­ton’s top eco­nomic fore­caster, Dr Yellen paid a visit to the Wash­ing­ton bureau of Bloomberg News in 1998. I re­call her speak­ing elo­quently about the deep fi­nan­cial melt­down rock­ing South Korea, In­done­sia and Thai­land. Most peo­ple in DC were too fo­cused on Ms Mon­ica Lewin­sky’s blue dress to give a darn about vi­tal Amer­i­can part­ners.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen still has to be con­firmed by the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>On bal­ance, her record was ex­em­plary. Even coming close in her new gig would be a great cap­stone to a ca­reer de­voted to pub­lic ser­vice.</p>
