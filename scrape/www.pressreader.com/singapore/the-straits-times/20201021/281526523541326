    <p>Di­ag­nos­ing a pa­tient with Covid-19 could soon be as easy as get­ting the per­son to breathe into a tube – and get­ting the re­sults in un­der a minute.</p>
    <p>The breathal­yser-type di­ag­nos­tic test kit, which is still at a pro­to­type stage, is be­ing de­vel­oped by Breathonix – a spin-off com­pany from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS).</p>
    <p>It has so far achieved an ac­cu­racy rate of more than 90 per cent dur­ing a pilot clin­i­cal trial in­volv­ing 180 pa­tients at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID), and re­searchers will con­tinue to fine-tune the al­go­rithm us­ing data col­lected from the next phases of the trial.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers are hop­ing to re­cruit up to 600 pa­tients over the next few months to val­i­date the tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Dr Jia Zhu­nan, an NUS grad­u­ate and the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Breathonix, is con­fi­dent that the breath test could be a game changer in Sin­ga­pore’s fight against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>For one, the breath test is easy to ad­min­is­ter, and does not re­quire spe­cially trained staff or lab­o­ra­tory pro­cess­ing usu­ally re­quired for poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests.</p>
    <p>“Re­sults are gen­er­ated in real time, mak­ing it an at­trac­tive so­lu­tion for mass screen­ing, es­pe­cially in ar­eas with high hu­man traf­fic,” Dr Jia added. Th­ese ar­eas could in­clude air­ports and dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The Breathonix test is un­like any other kits cur­rently on the mar­ket in that it does not de­tect vi­ral ge­netic frag­ments – which are what PCR tests pick up – or vi­ral pro­teins, de­tected by anti­gen rapid tests.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it reg­is­ters chem­i­cal changes in a pa­tient’s breath. Ev­ery ex­hale con­tains in­vis­i­ble par­ti­cles known as volatile or­ganic com­pounds (VOCs), which are pro­duced by var­i­ous bio­chem­i­cal re­ac­tions in hu­man cells.</p>
    <p>But the VOC sig­na­ture from a healthy per­son’s breath is dif­fer­ent from that of a per­son with an ill­ness. The breath sig­na­ture also dif­fers from disease to disease.</p>
    <p>“This re­sults in de­tectable changes in a per­son’s breath pro­file,” Dr Jia ex­plained. “As such, VOCs can be mea­sured as mark­ers for diseases like Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, breath tests are al­ready avail­able to di­ag­nose diseases such as asthma and Heli­cobac­ter py­lori in­fec­tion – a gas­tric disease.</p>
    <p>The Breathonix test works by first get­ting a per­son to blow into a dis­pos­able mouth­piece con­nected to a high-pre­ci­sion breath sam­pler.</p>
    <p>The ex­haled breath is col­lected and fed into a cut­ting-edge mass spec­trom­e­ter for mea­sure­ment. Ma­chine learn­ing soft­ware analy­ses the VOC pro­file and gen­er­ates the re­sult in less than a minute.</p>
    <p>Mr Du Fang, chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer of Breathonix, said: “The dis­pos­able mouth­piece that our sys­tem uses has a one-way valve and a saliva trap, pre­vent­ing in­hala­tion and any saliva from en­ter­ing the ma­chine. This makes cross-con­tam­i­na­tion un­likely.”</p>
    <p>Dr Shawn Va­soo, NCID clin­i­cal direc­tor, told The Straits Times that while the new breath test may serve as a screen­ing test, a con­fir­ma­tory PCR test will likely still be needed to di­ag­nose Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He said that although the breath test shows promise, more val­i­da­tion work needs to be done.</p>
    <p>“It is still too early to com­pare VOC di­ag­nos­tics to PCR, which is the cur­rent di­ag­nos­tic ‘gold stan­dard’, as more data is needed,” Dr Va­soo added.</p>
    <p>Breathonix was spun off from NUS un­der the NUS Grad­u­ate Re­search In­no­va­tion Pro­gramme last year, with the ini­tial goal of us­ing breath tech­nol­ogy to di­ag­nose pa­tients with lung can­cer.</p>
    <p>Dr Jia, who com­pleted her PhD re­search on breath VOC anal­y­sis for lung can­cer, was in­spired to en­ter the field af­ter she came across a 1989 pa­per in the med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet.</p>
    <p>The jour­nal had re­ported on how a 44-year-old woman sought treat­ment for a le­sion on her left thigh be­cause her dog kept sniff­ing at it. The di­ag­no­sis was melanoma, a type of skin can­cer, which was still treat­able.</p>
    <p>It prompted Dr Jia to think about how other ill­nesses could be di­ag­nosed in this way. Lung can­cer, which is of­ten not di­ag­nosed and pro­gresses quickly, was one area Breathonix was fo­cus­ing on.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has de­layed plans to de­velop the tech­nol­ogy for lung can­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Du, how­ever, saw an op­por­tu­nity: “re­train­ing” the al­go­rithm to recog­nise the VOC sig­na­tures of Covid-19 pa­tients. This was done based on data from 180 pa­tients re­cruited from NCID, among whom 48 were Covid-19-pos­i­tive and 132 neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Dr Va­soo said NCID hopes that new tech­nolo­gies which are rapid and pro­vide real-time data may be­come avail­able as an ac­cu­rate screen­ing tool for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I think this would be wel­come es­pe­cially in spe­cific set­tings where large num­bers of peo­ple may need to be screened,” he said, although there is no set time­line for this.</p>
    <p>“A lot will de­pend on fur­ther val­i­da­tion work that many of us are busy with, which will help us to bet­ter as­sess its per­for­mance,” he added.</p>
