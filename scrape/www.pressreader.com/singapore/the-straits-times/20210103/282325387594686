    <p>Cloudy with a chance of meat­balls – that is the out­look for the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try, as more op­er­a­tors turn to the ris­ing num­ber of cloud or ghost kitchens is­land­wide to ex­pand their reach to hun­gry hordes across the is­land.</p>
    <p>These shared kitchens – which mainly cater for food de­liv­ery and do not have a phys­i­cal shop front – pro­vided a life­line for F&B busi­nesses that could not op­er­ate dur­ing last year’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, and gave in­dus­try play­ers a chance to test out new con­cepts.</p>
    <p>One of t hem – The So­cial Kitchen at the YMCA Or­chard and Jurong Bird Park – stood out, as the so­cial en­ter­prise pro­vides em­ploy­ment to dis­ad­van­taged in­di­vid­u­als. It is look­ing to set up no fewer than 50 kitchens across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>With lower start-up costs and less man­power re­quired, cloud kitchens will be the launch sites for many new eater­ies this year.</p>
    <p>Those al­ready part of kitchens set up by food de­liv­ery plat­forms – GrabFood, De­liv­eroo and Food­panda – will fo­cus on just pre­par­ing food or­dered, as they tap the com­pa­nies’ fleet of de­liv­ery riders, mar­ket­ing team and data anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>This year, Food­panda alone plans to open five more cloud kitchens in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, home-grown food tech com­pany TiffinLabs says it is mak­ing progress on its bullish goal to roll out 1,000 kitchens glob­ally.</p>
    <p>And with more cloud kitchens on the hori­zon, more vir­tual F&B brands have been set up to test the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>They have seen how well re­cently launched vir­tual brands, such as Gus­tavo La­pasta and Bur­rata Joy by one-Miche­lin-starred Ital­ian restau­rant Garibaldi, which are on De­liv­eroo, are do­ing.</p>
    <p>A De­liv­eroo spokesman says: “Vir­tual brands al­low restau­rant part­ners to reach out to au­di­ences who might have never heard of them be­fore, with new con­cepts. By widen­ing the restau­rants’ of­fer­ings to con­sumers, they pro­vide a crit­i­cal growth av­enue in these chal­leng­ing times.”</p>
    <p>The Les Amis Group’s first cloud</p>
    <p>kitchen – named Kitch – is slated to de­but by early next month in Seran­goon Gar­den. It can house seven con­cepts, avail­able for take­away and de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>First to launch are the group’s ca­sual con­cepts Mui Kee Con­gee, and Peper­oni Pronto, which will fea­ture a con­densed menu of best­sellers from its ex­ist­ing Peper­oni Pizze­ria.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar hawker stall, One Prawn Noodle, will also be part of Kitch as a ten­ant, as Golden Mile Food Cen­tre, where it usu­ally op­er­ates, is closed for ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Other vir­tual brands in the pipe­line in­clude Mui Kee Noo­dles, a spin-off of Mui Kee Con­gee that fo­cuses on Hong Kong-style noo­dles and sides; and Yu­jin Bowls, an off­shoot of the group’s Yu­jin Iza­kaya con­cept.</p>
    <p>Mr Luke Pang, Les Amis Group’s head of busi­ness de­vel­op­ment, ob­serves that more stand­alone cloud kitchens are pop­ping up, some with an ad­di­tional food pro­duc­tion li­cence for busi­nessto-busi­ness sales, in ad­di­tion to the usual li­cence for busi­ness-to­con­sumer sales.</p>
    <p>He says: “Com­pared with the cloud kitchen scene in the United States, the cloud kitchen scene in Sin­ga­pore is in its early stages due to the Covid-19 ac­cel­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will likely see a firmer clus­ter­ing of three groups – cloud kitchens by de­liv­ery plat­forms, cloud kitchens run by food op­er­a­tors/cater­ers, and cloud kitchens run on a land­lord-ten­ant re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic shakes up – and out – the in­dus­try, he projects a con­sol­i­da­tion of kitchens.</p>
    <p>“Brands with a suf­fi­cient port­fo­lio are likely to ex­plore cloud kitchens on their own.</p>
    <p>“Cater­ing com­pa­nies could also open up por­tions of their un­der­utilised fa­cil­i­ties to roll out cloud kitchens or do food pro­duc­tion,” he says.</p>
    <p>Watch your front door. Your birth­day meal this year may ar­rive on wheels from a cloud kitchen near you.</p>
    <p>We will likely see a firmer clus­ter­ing of three groups – cloud kitchens by de­liv­ery plat­forms, cloud kitchens run by food op­er­a­tors/ cater­ers, and cloud kitchens run on a land­lord-ten­ant re­la­tion­ship.</p>
