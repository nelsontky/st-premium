    <p>Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard be­lieves Hakim Ziyech has added a new di­men­sion to their at­tack after the Morocco in­ter­na­tional’s mas­ter­ful per­for­mance in Satur­day’s 4-1 Premier League win over Sh­effield United.</p>
    <p>Ziyech, who j oined Chelsea from Ajax in the close-sea­son for a re­ported €40 mil­lion (S$64 mil­lion), was a con­stant threat and claimed two as­sists as Lam­pard’s side won their fourth con­sec­u­tive game in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old winger has been a key part of their run, hav­ing scored twice and pro­vided three as­sists in seven games, and Lam­pard is im­pressed at how quickly Ziyech has set­tled into life at Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>“He’s a top-class player,” he told re­porters. “He’s had a long time out since the Dutch league fin­ished and then he had an in­jury, so to hit the ground run­ning the way he has is a huge plus for us.</p>
    <p>“He has given us an ex­tra edge and a dif­fer­ent threat... He has an abil­ity to find the last pass or cross, make as­sists and break teams that have a low block down... He sees the pass and has no fear to try it.</p>
    <p>“He ex­udes con­fi­dences in how much he wants to re­ceive the ball and be the im­por­tant player. He also has great work ethic so he is a com­plete player. He’s been a big plus and I ex­pect there is a lot more to come from him.”</p>
    <p>Lam­pard also feels that his sum­mer splurge of over £200 mil­lion (S$354.7 mil­lion) to turn his side into ti­tle chal­lengers is pay­ing div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers we brought in, we brought in to im­prove,” said the</p>
    <p>Blues great, who in his maiden sea­son led the team to fourth place.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple ex­pect it to come on day one. It’s not like that, it’s a work in progress. You saw a lot of it today, there are great signs but we have to keep go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Goals by Tammy Abra­ham, Ben Chilwell, Thi­ago Silva – his first since ar­riv­ing in the sum­mer on a free trans­fer from Paris Saint-Ger­main – and Timo Werner helped the Blues over­whelm bot­tom side United, but Lam­pard warned his play­ers to guard against com­pla­cency.</p>
    <p>“It was our best per­for­mance of the sea­son. We are in a good place, but the level set by Manch­ester City and Liver­pool in the last few years means we have to be in that place ev­ery game,” he added.</p>
    <p>“At the start of the sea­son, we had new play­ers, the lack of pre­sea­son, in­juries, but now we are see­ing some of the work. I’m the first to keep my feet on the ground. Ev­ery game is chal­leng­ing.”</p>
