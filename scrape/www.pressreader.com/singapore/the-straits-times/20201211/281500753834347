    <p>Sin­ga­pore has signed a free trade agree­ment (FTA) with the United King­dom to en­sure that com­pa­nies from both coun­tries con­tinue to en­joy the same ben­e­fits that they are re­ceiv­ing un­der the Repub­lic’s FTA with the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment inked yes­ter­day will cover more than £17 bil­lion (S$30.3 bil­lion) of cur­rent bi­lat­eral trade in goods and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries also agreed to as­sess the mod­ules of a UK-Sin­ga­pore dig­i­tal econ­omy agree­ment (DEA), with a view to launch­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions on the DEA next year.</p>
    <p>They also com­mit­ted to start talks on and con­clude an in­vest­ment pro­tec­tion agree­ment within two and four years, re­spec­tively, of the FTA’s entry into force.</p>
    <p>The FTA was signed in Sin­ga­pore by Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing and Bri­tish Sec­re­tary of State for In­ter­na­tional Trade El­iz­a­beth Truss.</p>
    <p>Ms Truss, in an interview with The Straits Times, said the FTA will come into force on Jan 1, which is when Bri­tain ends the tran­si­tion pe­riod for its exit from the EU – the so-called Brexit.</p>
    <p>Ms Truss said: “We want to se­cure a Canada-style deal with the EU, but if we are not able to se­cure that, we will trade with the EU on Aus­tralian-style terms. Nei­ther of those</p>
    <p>two ar­range­ments will af­fect the deal with Sin­ga­pore, as the deal with Sin­ga­pore is done.”</p>
    <p>A Canada-style pact will get rid of most but not all tar­iffs, while an Aus­tralian-style agree­ment is ba­si­cally no trade deal at all and will fall back on World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion terms.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the event, Mr Chan noted that Bri­tain is Sin­ga­pore’s third- and sec­ond-largest trad­ing part­ner for goods and ser­vices, re­spec­tively, as well as its top in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion in Europe.</p>
    <p>In turn, Sin­ga­pore is Bri­tain’s largest trade and in­vest­ment part­ner in South-east Asia, he said.</p>
    <p>The deal’s im­me­di­ate and tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits in­clude tar­iff elim­i­na­tion for 84 per cent of all tar­iff lines for Sin­ga­pore ex­ports to Bri­tain upon the UKSFTA’s entry into force, with vir­tu­ally all re­main­ing tar­iffs elim­i­nated by Novem­ber 2024 – the same time­line un­der Sin­ga­pore’s FTA with the EU (EUSFTA).</p>
    <p>It will also en­hance mar­ket ac­cess for Asian food products made in Sin­ga­pore such as har gow (prawn dumplings) and sam­bal ikan bilis (spicy crispy an­chovies), Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI), in a state­ment is­sued after the sign­ing of the FTA, said the ben­e­fits of the UK-Sin­ga­pore FTA in­clude tar­iff elim­i­na­tion for goods trade, and in­creased ac­cess to re­spec­tive ser­vices and gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment mar­kets.</p>
    <p>It will also re­duce non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers in at least four ma­jor sec­tors: elec­tron­ics, mo­tor vehicles and ve­hi­cle parts, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal products and med­i­cal de­vices, and re­new­able en­ergy gen­er­a­tion. The trade deal will also sup­port the re­gional op­er­a­tions and sup­ply chains of firms in Bri­tain and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In line with the cur­rent ar­range­ment un­der the FTA with the EU, com­pa­nies in Bri­tain and Sin­ga­pore can con­tinue to use ma­te­ri­als and parts sourced from the EU-27 and Asean in their ex­ports to each other’s mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed UK-Sin­ga­pore DEA will also serve as a pathfinder for mod­ern rules on dig­i­tal trade and fi­nan­cial ser­vices be­tween Europe and South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will also sup­port Bri­tain’s bid to join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP).</p>
    <p>Mr Ho Meng Kit, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion, said the FTA will al­low busi­nesses here to en­joy greater cer­tainty and as­sur­ance after Bri­tain’s exit from the EU.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, busi­nesses should note that UK’s in­de­pen­dent trade reg­u­la­tions may dif­fer from that of the EU’s. They will also need to en­sure that they com­ply with changes in UK’s do­mes­tic stan­dards and Cus­toms pro­ce­dures,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to work­ing with both gov­ern­ments to sup­port busi­nesses cop­ing with these changes, par­tic­u­larly those which may be us­ing the UK as a hub to re-ex­port to Europe or to of­fer ser­vices to EU cus­tomers.”</p>
