    <p>The Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) will re­view the penalty frame­work in cases sim­i­lar to the re­cent one in­volv­ing a den­tistry stu­dent who tried to stran­gle his former girl­friend and pressed his thumb against her eye af­ter she re­jected him.</p>
    <p>The re­view will, among other things, look at the ex­tent to which an of­fender’s back­ground, in­clud­ing his ed­u­ca­tional sta­tus, should be a rel­e­vant fac­tor in what penal­ties should be ap­plied.</p>
    <p>This was dis­closed by Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shanmugam in an in­ter­view yes­ter­day in the wake of out­rage over the stu­dent’s sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore (NUS) stu­dent Yin Zi Qin, 23, was sen­tenced last Fri­day to a short de­ten­tion or­der of 12 days and 80 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice for at­tack­ing his former girl­friend on May 9 last year.</p>
    <p>He was also given a day re­port­ing or­der of five months, which means he will have to re­port to a cen­tre for mon­i­tor­ing and coun­selling, and un­dergo re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion. He will not have a crim­i­nal record upon his re­lease.</p>
    <p>Many ob­servers, in­clud­ing the People’s Ac­tion Party Women’s Wing and the As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search, have crit­i­cised the out­come of the case, be­liev­ing that Yin’s pun­ish­ment was dis­pro­por­tion­ate to his offence. Yin has since been sus­pended from NUS and is not al­lowed on cam­pus.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the in­ter­view, Mr Shanmugam said he “en­tirely un­der­stands” the strong feel­ings over the pun­ish­ment, adding that women MPs and his own of­fi­cers had spo­ken to him about it.</p>
    <p>He said the re­view would cover three ar­eas: the penal­ties for such cases in gen­eral; the ex­tent to which an of­fender’s back­ground, among other fac­tors, should be rel­e­vant in penal­ties; and how pun­ish­ments for such of­fences stack up against pun­ish­ments for other of­fences like theft.</p>
    <p>He also said that he pre­ferred not to com­ment on the specifics of Yin’s case.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s nat­u­ral when people are un­happy, they look at the courts and the judges,” said Mr Shanmugam. How­ever, the courts are “not the is­sue” here as judges de­cide based on what is pre­sented to them, he said.</p>
    <p>“When we dis­agree, the ap­proach should be to look at the le­gal pol­icy frame­work, which the Govern­ment can change, and which is what we will do.”</p>
    <p>He added that the penal­ties for such cases are stiff at present, but the min­istry will also re­view that.</p>
    <p>For vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt, Yin could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000.</p>
    <p>In May last year, the vic­tim broke up with Yin. He then used an ac­cess card she pre­vi­ously gave him to ac­cess her house. He met her in the base­ment, and they snuck into her room where the in­ci­dent oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Yin pleaded with her not to end their re­la­tion­ship, but she re­fused. He then hit his own head against the wall, placed his hands on the vic­tim’s neck and tried to stran­gle her.</p>
    <p>Af­ter she strug­gled, he re­leased his grip and pressed his thumb against her eye, caus­ing it to bleed. She later blacked out, but came to and or­dered him to leave.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing sen­tenc­ing, Dis­trict Judge Marvin Bay said he was sat­is­fied that Yin was not at high risk of re-of­fend­ing, and added that his rel­a­tive youth, re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive prospects and lack of an­tecedents made a com­mu­nity-based sen­tence vi­able, rather than a con­ven­tional sen­tence of im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>The judge noted that the vic­tim did not suf­fer per­ma­nent in­jury to her eye but had suf­fered some de­gree of psy­cho­log­i­cal harm.</p>
    <p>She suf­fered from in­som­nia and was haunted by night­mares of Yin breaking into her house and as­sault</p>
    <p>COURTS NOT THE IS­SUE</p>
    <p>When we dis­agree, the ap­proach should be to look at the le­gal pol­icy frame­work, which the Govern­ment can change, and which is what we will do. ’’</p>
    <p>HOME AF­FAIRS AND LAW MIN­IS­TER K. SHANMUGAM, say­ing the courts are “not the is­sue” here as judges de­cide based on what is pre­sented to them.</p>
    <p>Mr Shanmugam said the re­view would cover three ar­eas: the penal­ties for such cases in gen­eral; the ex­tent to which an of­fender’s back­ground, among other fac­tors, should be rel­e­vant in penal­ties; and how pun­ish­ments for such of­fences stack up against pun­ish­ments for other of­fences like theft.</p>
    <p>ing her, said the judge.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion had sought a short de­ten­tion or­der of 14 days. It is not ap­peal­ing the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>In mit­i­ga­tion, Yin’s de­fence coun­sel said his client had vol­un­tar­ily re­turned to the vic­tim’s house to seek for­give­ness from her and her par­ents af­ter the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Yin was sub­se­quently punched and slapped sev­eral times in the face by the vic­tim’s step­fa­ther, who also burnt his face with a cig­a­rette butt.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands the step­fa­ther was given a warn­ing by the po­lice.</p>
