    <p>The re­cent pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in the United States, which has long held it­self up as a “shin­ing city on a hill”, or a model democ­racy for the world, threw up more heat than light.</p>
    <p>Some have lamented that the stale­mate af­ter Nov 3, with an in­cum­bent leader cast­ing doubts on the process and out­come, low­ered the stand­ing of the US in the world and un­der­cut the case for lib­eral democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Others at the other end of the ide­o­log­i­cal spec­trum have de­clared pretty much the same, tri­umphantly, if some­what pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>Most sig­nif­i­cantly, in my view, the elec­tion has made clear how vi­tal, and frag­ile, democ­racy is; how it can so eas­ily go wrong, with cru­cial out­comes of polls some­times turn­ing on a few hun­dred votes; and that elec­tions have con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Even in ma­ture democ­ra­cies, vot­ers have been known to hand power to those who use it to sub­vert the very sys­tem that made their elec­tion pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The up­shot of this is clear: to work, democ­ra­cies need more than elec­tions.</p>
    <p>They must be un­der­pinned by a shared po­lit­i­cal cul­ture, with con­ven­tions and val­ues that are re­spected and up­held by all play­ers. They have to be sup­ported by strong in­sti­tu­tions – from trusted elec­tion of­fi­cials, in­de­pen­dent civil ser­vants and judges, and also a cred­i­ble and trusted me­dia.</p>
    <p>Democ­racy can­not func­tion in a world of al­ter­na­tive facts, fake news, and the win­ning of ar­gu­ments by sheer as­ser­tion and re­it­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Nor can it thrive in a so­ci­ety where vot­ers choose not to be en­gaged, al­low­ing them­selves to fall into opin­ion bub­bles, out­sourc­ing their think­ing and de­ci­sion-mak­ing to others, whether that be big tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies or for­eign pow­ers only too will­ing to oblige.</p>
    <p>In­deed, a thought­ful book by tech­nol­ogy writer Jamie Bartlett, The Peo­ple Vs Tech: How The In­ter­net Is Killing Democ­racy, points to sev­eral pre­req­ui­sites for a func­tion­ing democ­racy – ac­tive ci­ti­zens, ca­pa­ble of mak­ing im­por­tant moral judg­ments; a shared cul­ture of democ­racy, in­clud­ing a spirit of give-and-take and the will­ing­ness to com­pro­mise; elec­tions that must be free, fair and trusted; man­age­able lev­els of equal­ity among all stake­hold­ers; com­pe­ti­tion in the econ­omy and au­ton­omy in the civic sphere; trust in the sys­tem, which is fos­tered by the au­thor­i­ties re­main­ing in touch with and ac­count­able to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The most crit­i­cal of all of these, to my mind, is trust.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers must be­lieve that the sys­tem, which pur­ports to be rule by the peo­ple, for the peo­ple, gen­uinely re­flects their in­ter­ests and the pop­u­lar will.</p>
    <p>Which is why Mr Don­ald Trump’s con­tin­u­ing in­sis­tence that the elec­tion was fraud­u­lent is so cor­ro­sive.</p>
    <p>Although most ob­servers now ac­cept that he lost, the vast ma­jor­ity of his sup­port­ers be­lieve his un­backed as­ser­tions that the elec­tion was “rigged” or “stolen”.</p>
    <p>Car­i­ca­tures of the over 74 mil­lion vot­ers who backed him, though, of­ten paint them as naive, or plain wrong-headed.</p>
    <p>Yet, this re­flects the very con­de­scen­sion that these vot­ers have grown tired of from the coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal and in­tel­lec­tual elites.</p>
    <p>Rightly or not, these vot­ers be­lieved that Mr Trump re­flected their hopes and fears, and would safe­guard their in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>As The Econ­o­mist summed up well in an edi­to­rial: “Whether you sup­port them or not, Mr Trump and his fel­low pop­ulists came to power as a re­sponse to the fail­ing of demo­cratic govern­ments.</p>
    <p>“In rich coun­tries, work­ing-class vot­ers came to be­lieve that their politi­cians did not care about them, af­ter their liv­ing stan­dards stag­nated and they be­came wor­ried about im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>“In cen­tral and east­ern Europe, govern­ments seek­ing to join the EU paid more heed to Brussels than their own vot­ers. In de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, cor­rup­tion sent the mes­sage that the rul­ing classes were chiefly in­ter­ested in their own bank ac­counts.”</p>
    <p>Tak­ing up this idea on how pol­icy fail­ures and po­lit­i­cal mis­steps can fuel the rise of pop­ulism, Mr Bartlett cites Har­vard pro­fes­sors Steven Le­vit­sky and Daniel Zi­blatt, who pointed out in their book, How Democ­ra­cies Die, that this demise is not al­ways associated with bul­lets or bust-ups.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it can hap­pen in­sid­i­ously, with elected or ap­pointed of­fi­cials un­der­min­ing trust in key in­sti­tu­tions, egged on by po­larised and an­gry ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>The real threat, adds Mr Bartlett, could arise when large num­bers of peo­ple con­clude that “demo­cratic val­ues and in­sti­tu­tions no longer solve so­cial prob­lems, re­duce crime or cre­ate jobs”.</p>
    <p>TRUST V TECH</p>
    <p>But trust in the demo­cratic sys­tem can also be grad­u­ally whit­tled away, with vot­ers obliv­i­ous that it is even hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>As Mr Bartlett notes in his book, which pre­saged the think­ing in the re­cent Net­flix hit, The So­cial Dilemma: “We live in a gi­ant ad­ver­tis­ing panop­ti­con which keeps us ad­dicted to de­vices; this sys­tem of data col­lec­tion and pre­dic­tion is merely the most re­cent it­er­a­tion of a long his­tory of ef­forts to con­trol us; it is get­ting more ad­vanced by the day, which has se­ri­ous ram­i­fi­ca­tions for po­ten­tial ma­nip­u­la­tion, end­less dis­trac­tion and the slow di­min­ish­ing of free choice and au­ton­omy.”</p>
    <p>Through sheer dis­trac­tion or inat­ten­tion, many vot­ers are al­low­ing them­selves to be ma­nip­u­lated, their views formed and bi­ases re­in­forced by the in­for­ma­tion and opin­ions served to them – sup­pos­edly for free – by tech com­pa­nies with their opaque al­go­rithms, which they choose to click on, read, like, and share.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, big tech is watch­ing, pars­ing, and serv­ing more of what­ever is mostly likely to catch their fancy, the bet­ter to present ad­ver­tis­ing mes­sages from the high­est bid­der.</p>
    <p>This leaves the elec­torate open to be­ing swayed not just by po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, but also by com­mer­cial and ide­o­log­i­cal play­ers, at home and abroad.</p>
    <p>PO­LAR­I­SA­TION AND THE PRESS</p>
    <p>The ul­ti­mate check on the grow­ing po­lar­i­sa­tion so ev­i­dent in many so­ci­eties to­day must lie with vot­ers who take the trou­ble to stay wellinform­ed, arm­ing them­selves with knowl­edge and the abil­ity to make their own po­lit­i­cal choices and weigh up their long-term in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>But this is in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult in an ever more com­plex, hy­per­con­nected, fast-chang­ing world, with ci­ti­zens so buf­feted by the wel­ter of fake news, de­signed to mis­lead and con­fuse.</p>
    <p>The po­lar­i­sa­tion in some so­ci­eties is of­ten mir­rored in the me­dia. Any­one tog­gling be­tween the US elec­tion re­ports on CNN and Fox News in re­cent weeks might well have won­dered if they were re­port­ing on the same event.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers will there­fore be greatly aided in ex­er­cis­ing their civic du­ties by a re­spon­si­ble, cred­i­ble me­dia, which aims to pro­vide them the in­for­ma­tion they need, sep­a­rat­ing fact from fic­tion, ra­tio­nal ar­gu­ments from un­sub­stan­ti­ated as­ser­tions, striv­ing al­ways to be ac­cu­rate, bal­anced and fair.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, when me­dia or­gan­i­sa­tions are un­duly fo­cused on chas­ing eye­balls and rev­enues, of­ten with news­rooms starved of re­sources, they risk los­ing sight of this pub­lic ser­vice mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The un­der­ly­ing prob­lem here is that the busi­ness model that gave rise to pro­fes­sional news­rooms and helped sus­tain them has been fun­da­men­tally gut­ted by the rise of tech com­pa­nies, ag­gres­sively push­ing news for “free”.</p>
    <p>As me­dia guru Ken Doc­tor notes in his book, New­so­nomics: Twelve New Trends That Will Shape The News You Get: “The ques­tion we face is how we’re go­ing to pay pro­fes­sion­als to get us the news we need.</p>
    <p>“We see Na­tional Pub­lic Ra­dio (NPR)-like mem­ber­ship mod­els, com­mu­nity and na­tional foun­da­tion in­ter­est, civic-minded in­vestors and event-ori­ented busi­ness mod­els. We hear about non­prof­its and com­mu­nity trusts ... we hear about news busi­nesses be­ing ab­sorbed, lever­aged, and (maybe) pro­tected by global con­glom­er­ates.</p>
    <p>“We talk about new tax ap­proaches that may fund news and in­for­ma­tion, as our Western Euro­pean neigh­bours have been do­ing for decades. We see ex­per­i­ments with mi­cro-pay­ments and new on­line sub­scrip­tion ini­tia­tives. Fi­nally, we see the po­ten­tial of a reck­on­ing with the big search-en­gine ag­gre­ga­tors who, to­day, get a pretty big piece of the pie, and have a prob­lem with shar­ing.”</p>
    <p>While none of the above might be a sil­ver bul­let, the good Doc­tor rightly con­cludes that for democ­ra­cies to re­main ro­bust, so­ci­eties are go­ing to have to de­cide that “re­li­able news and in­for­ma­tion is at least as wor­thy as Star­bucks of our daily tithing”.</p>
    <p>This is worth pon­der­ing, for as the ex­perts say, as the me­dia goes, so goes democ­racy.</p>
    <p>ONE FOR ALL</p>
    <p>The great US Pres­i­dent John F. Kennedy once de­clared: “One man can make a dif­fer­ence, and ev­ery man should try.”</p>
    <p>While this might be slightly out of kil­ter in these gen­der-neu­tral times, his state­ment re­mains rel­e­vant and car­ries a dou­ble sig­nif­i­cance in the light of re­cent de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Yes, one man can make a huge dif­fer­ence, whip­ping up pop­ulist sen­ti­ments to win power, and then wield­ing it to un­der­mine in­sti­tu­tions, ca­jole of­fi­cials, vil­ify po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents as well as pro­fes­sion­als in the me­dia, and even ap­point­ing peo­ple to key roles to en­trench his views and po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Alas, this can hap­pen, even in a democ­racy, and some ma­ture ones at that.</p>
    <p>If the much-cher­ished rule of “by the peo­ple, for the peo­ple” is to pre­vail, then ev­ery one of us should try to do our part, as en­gaged, in­formed and ac­tive ci­ti­zens, striv­ing to en­sure that those who pro­mote po­lit­i­cal sweet­ness and light, trump those who would sow divi­sion and dis­cord.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, democ­racy de­pends on you and me.</p>
    <p>The ul­ti­mate check on the grow­ing po­lar­i­sa­tion so ev­i­dent in many so­ci­eties to­day must lie with vot­ers who take the trou­ble to stay well-in­formed, arm­ing them­selves with knowl­edge and the abil­ity to make their own po­lit­i­cal choices and weigh up their long-term in­ter­ests.</p>
