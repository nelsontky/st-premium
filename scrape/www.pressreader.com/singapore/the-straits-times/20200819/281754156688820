    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will in­ten­sify its en­gage­ments with the se­nior man­age­ment of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions on their work­force profiles and plans to grow the Sin­ga­porean core, said its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon.</p>
    <p>In a re­ply pub­lished to­day to a let­ter to The Straits Times Fo­rum page, Mr Menon said: “Pro­tect­ing and grow­ing Sin­ga­porean jobs, es­pe­cially in cur­rent eco­nomic con­di­tions, is a top pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>He pointed to a $125 mil­lion pack­age es­tab­lished by MAS ear­lier this year to en­cour­age fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to re­tain, train and hire Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to a let­ter, pub­lished on Aug 15, from re­tired se­nior banker Ray­mond Koh, who called for an ex­am­i­na­tion of the work­force com­po­si­tion in banks. “As a re­tired se­nior banker, I can say cat­e­gor­i­cally that in the past two decades, many for­eign­ers hired in Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nance sec­tor have been for up­per-mid­dle to se­nior man­age­ment po­si­tions,” wrote Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon wrote: “While not yet where we want to be for every fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, the pic­ture across the sec­tor as a whole is better than of­ten por­trayed.”</p>
    <p>He said MAS es­ti­mates that cit­i­zens make up 70 per cent of the sec­tor’s work­force, with per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) ac­count­ing for an­other 14 per cent. Sin­ga­pore­ans take up 43 per cent of se­nior man­age­ment jobs across the sec­tor, re­flect­ing the Repub­lic’s role as an in­ter­na­tional hub, he said.</p>
    <p>The peren­nial hot-but­ton topic of for­eign tal­ent is in the spot­light again amid the Covid-19 pan­demic and eco­nomic down­turn. There have been calls, in Fo­rum let­ters, for the Gov­ern­ment to re­view its labour poli­cies by grant­ing fewer em­ploy­ment passes. Oth­ers urged lo­cal work­ers to view for­eign­ers as col­lab­o­ra­tors and not com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>Re­tail banks told ST that lo­cal work­ers make up a size­able por­tion of their work­force in tech­nol­ogy and risk man­age­ment, ar­eas that Mr Menon said could be im­proved.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) head of group human re­sources Dean Tong said eight in 10 of its staff in these teams are Sin­ga­pore­ans or PRs.</p>
    <p>A DBS Bank spokesman said cit­i­zens and PRs make up nearly 95 per cent of its risk man­age­ment team and 85 per cent of its tech­nol­ogy and op­er­a­tions team.</p>
    <p>He added that 15 out of 16 mem­bers of DBS’ top lead­er­ship team in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Piyush Gupta, are Sin­ga­pore­ans, while one is a PR.</p>
    <p>An OCBC Bank spokesman said that 84 per cent of its staff in the ar­eas of tech­nol­ogy and risk man­age­ment are cit­i­zens and PRs.</p>
    <p>The banks added that they have ini­tia­tives i n place to en­sure a strong pipe­line of lo­cal tal­ent.</p>
    <p>UOB’s Mr Tong said the bank launched its flag­ship train­ing pro­gramme Better U last year to equip staff with tech­ni­cal skills to suc­ceed in the dig­i­tal fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, DBS said it is hir­ing sea­soned pro­fes­sion­als in growth tech­nol­ogy ar­eas such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, cloud com­put­ing, full stack devel­op­ment and data an­a­lyt­ics through a range of spe­cialised pro­grammes which cater to lo­cals.</p>
    <p>It will hire close to 150 young grad­u­ates yearly for tal­ent devel­op­ment pro­grammes such as the bank’s grad­u­ate as­so­ciate pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Human Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem said it is im­por­tant for lo­cal work­ers to stay rel­e­vant by be­ing fa­mil­iar with global changes, for in­stance in fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy and al­ter­na­tive pay­ment plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“That would be how we can grow the lo­cal tal­ent pool, to make our lo­cals the best match for those jobs, and not just de­pend on quota.”</p>
    <p>Ms Low said banks and other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions should abide by fair hir­ing guide­lines, re­cruit staff based on merit and con­sider the di­ver­sity and makeup of their work­force at all lev­els, in­clud­ing the mid­dle- and se­nior-man­age­ment lev­els.</p>
    <p>She noted: “Banks should also con­sider that lo­cals may have greater fa­mil­iar­ity with the lo­cal and re­gional busi­ness con­text and dy­nam­ics.”</p>
