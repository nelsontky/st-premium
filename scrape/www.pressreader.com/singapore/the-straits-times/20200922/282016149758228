    <p>Check­ing in and out with SafeEn­try is now as easy as tap­ping the back of your phone, if you hap­pen to be an iPhone user and have down­loaded the lat­est iOS 14 soft­ware up­date.</p>
    <p>This SafeEn­try trick makes use of an iPhone app called Siri Short­cuts, which lets users trig­ger cer­tain tasks with short­cuts such as a tap or voice com­mand.</p>
    <p>Users sim­ply have to open the SingPass app on their iPhone to ac­ti­vate Siri Short­cuts for SafeEn­try, be­fore also turn­ing on an­other func­tion called Back Tap.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal step is to as­sign, with Back Tap, the dou­ble-tap­ping and triple-tap­ping ac­tions to check­ing in and out with SafeEn­try, re­spec­tively. This means that in­stead of hav­ing to man­u­ally open the SingPass app each time, users need only to dou­ble-tap the back of their phones to call up the SafeEn­try QR code scan­ner, or triple-tap to check out.</p>
    <p>The ubiq­ui­tous SafeEn­try is Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional dig­i­tal check-in sys­tem that logs the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­bers and mo­bile num­bers of in­di­vid­u­als vis­it­ing venues, in or­der to aid con­tact-trac­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar lo­cal blog­ger Lee Kin Mun, bet­ter known as mr­brown, posted the SafeEn­try iOS 14 “Pro Tip” on Facebook on Sun­day. His post had drawn more than 1,300 likes and 4,300 shares as of 8pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee noted that users can also set up their iPhones to per­form the same task in re­sponse to a voice com­mand to the iPhone’s vir­tual as­sis­tant Siri.</p>
    <p>“You can say that to Siri, yes,” Mr Lee wrote in a re­ply to one user. “Or cus­tomise it to re­spond to ‘Siri, scan me lah’.”</p>
    <p>The Siri Short­cuts app was among a range of fea­tures that re­ceived up­grades with Ap­ple’s iOS 14 soft­ware up­date, which was rolled out last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple typ­i­cally re­leases new soft­ware up­dates to co­in­cide with the launch of a new phone model, but the iOS 14 up­date is avail­able to users of the iPhone 6S and later models.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the SafeEn­try trick works only on newer iPhones with the Back Tap func­tion be­gin­ning with the iPhone 8, which was re­leased in 2017.</p>
    <p>The phone must also be un­locked for the trick to work.</p>
    <p>Other new fea­tures that come with iOS 14 in­clude wid­gets, a trans­la­tion app that sup­ports an ini­tial 11 lan­guages, and a se­cu­rity fea­ture that alerts users about pass­words that have been com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>But An­droid users need not feel left out as far as SafeEn­try is con­cerned.</p>
    <p>A wid­get with the TraceTo­gether app brings up the SafeEn­try menu with a sin­gle tap.</p>
