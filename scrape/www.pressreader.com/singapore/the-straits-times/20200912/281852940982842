    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump flooded the Fox News air­waves and launched a Twit­ter rant on Thurs­day in an at­tempt to ride out dam­age from in­ter­views he gave to jour­nal­ist Bob Wood­ward in the bomb­shell new book Rage.</p>
    <p>First there was a late Wed­nes­day night call-in with his friend, Fox News per­son­al­ity Sean Han­nity.</p>
    <p>Early on Thurs­day, he fol­lowed up with a Fox News Ra­dio in­ter­view fo­cused on his nom­i­na­tion by a right-wing mem­ber of Nor­way’s Par­lia­ment for the No­bel Peace Prize, some­thing he called “a great thing for our coun­try”.</p>
    <p>Later in the day, there was a hastily or­gan­ised White House press con­fer­ence, dur­ing which Mr Trump de­nied ly­ing to Amer­i­cans about the sever­ity of the coronaviru­s out­break.</p>
    <p>And then there were the tweets – dozens fired in wildly ran­dom di­rec­tions, from ex­tolling the “good health” of North Korean strong­man Kim Jong Un to crit­i­cis­ing Mr Wood­ward.</p>
    <p>De­spite the blus­ter, Mr Trump’s taped ad­mis­sion to Mr Wood­ward – that he had played down the coronaviru­s cri­sis in pub­lic while be­ing aware of the unique dan­ger from the dis­ease – has set off alarm bells less than eight weeks be­fore elec­tion day on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Rage is filled with star­tling episodes, in­clud­ing the as­sess­ment by Mr Trump’s then direc­tor of na­tional in­tel­li­gence Dan Coats that the Pres­i­dent “doesn’t know the dif­fer­ence be­tween the truth and a lie”.</p>
    <p>But most of the at­ten­tion is on the seg­ments in which Mr Trump can­didly dis­cusses the coronaviru­s pandemic – which has by now killed al­most 200,000 Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>De­spite openly de­scrib­ing to Mr Wood­ward the scary char­ac­ter­is­tics of the then un­known virus, Mr Trump said: “I wanted to al­ways play it down.”</p>
    <p>Al­though he went on to ex­plain that he wanted to avoid caus­ing panic, his ac­knowl­edge­ment that he had de­lib­er­ately failed to tell the coun­try the un­var­nished truth has started a firestorm.</p>
    <p>“He knew how deadly it was,” Mr Trump’s Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den said on Wed­nes­day. “He lied to the Amer­i­can peo­ple. He know­ingly and will­ingly lied about the threat it posed to the coun­try for months.”</p>
    <p>Asked at Thurs­day’s White House press con­fer­ence “Why did you lie to the Amer­i­can peo­ple?”, Mr Trump re­sponded: “I didn’t lie.”</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­li­can, who is down in the polls against Mr Bi­den and faces over­whelm­ing dis­ap­proval from Amer­i­cans over his han­dling of the coronaviru­s cri­sis, in­sisted that he had soft­ened the dan­gers in pub­lic so as to pre­serve calm.</p>
    <p>“I don’t want to jump up and down and start scream­ing ‘Death! Death!’” he ar­gued.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump usu­ally fights crit­i­cism by blam­ing what he calls “the fake news” and claim­ing that un­named sources com­monly used in White House re­port­ing do not ex­ist.</p>
    <p>But shoot­ing the mes­sen­ger will not work in the case of Rage.</p>
    <p>The shock­ing rev­e­la­tions in the book rely mostly on Mr Trump him­self and Mr Wood­ward – fa­mous for bring­ing down pres­i­dent Richard Nixon in the Water­gate scan­dal – has pub­lished his record­ings.</p>
    <p>In one dig at Mr Wood­ward on Thurs­day, Mr Trump tweeted that if the re­porter thought that the quotes were “so bad or dan­ger­ous, why didn’t he im­me­di­ately re­port them in an ef­fort to save lives?”</p>
    <p>“Be­cause he knew they were good and proper an­swers. Calm, no panic!” Mr Trump ar­gued.</p>
    <p>Why Mr Trump would have granted Mr Wood­ward so much ac­cess in an elec­tion year, how­ever, is a ques­tion many in Wash­ing­ton are ask­ing. The re­porter man­aged to se­cure 18 in­ter­views with the Pres­i­dent and was en­tirely open about them be­ing put on tape.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany, Mr Trump went ahead “be­cause he is the most trans­par­ent pres­i­dent in his­tory”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has a life­time of ex­pe­ri­ence in sales­man­ship and per­form­ing on tele­vi­sion, has in­deed set a new record for his un­prece­dented num­ber of press con­fer­ences and im­promptu ques­tio­nand-an­swer ses­sions.</p>
    <p>But the per­for­mances of­ten leave his own staff scram­bling in dam­age lim­i­ta­tion mode, like when he mused at a press con­fer­ence about the pos­si­ble ben­e­fits of in­ject­ing Covid-19 pa­tients with bleach.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal run be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion, aides and al­lies are again grit­ting their teeth.</p>
    <p>Mr Karl Rove, the Re­pub­li­can cam­paign mas­ter­mind in the Ge­orge W. Bush era, had this warn­ing for Mr Trump: “If the Pres­i­dent isn’t fo­cused... the oc­cu­pant of the Oval Of­fice is set to change.”</p>
