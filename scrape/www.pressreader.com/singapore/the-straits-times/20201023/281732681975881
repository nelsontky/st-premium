    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia is reopen­ing its bor­ders to in­ter­na­tional visi­tors in a bid to re­vive eco­nomic growth even as the South Asian na­tion faces the world’s sec­ond-worst coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi is us­ing a dip in new Covid-19 in­fec­tions to prise open the econ­omy from its strict lock­down, wel­com­ing for­eign­ers on busi­ness trips, but not tourists.</p>
    <p>While reg­u­lar sched­uled com­mer­cial flights re­main off lim­its for the time be­ing, over­seas trav­ellers can use other op­tions, in­clud­ing flights un­der a govern­ment repa­tri­a­tion pro­gramme, so-called air-bub­ble agree­ments, and pri­vate char­ters, the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ships will also be per­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>All trav­ellers must “strictly ad­here” to the guide­lines on quar­an­tine and other rules.</p>
    <p>The sur­prise de­ci­sion comes after the num­ber of daily in­fec­tions in In­dia dropped to around 55,000 ver­sus al­most 100,000 last month.</p>
    <p>A govern­ment panel of sci­en­tists said this week the na­tion may have seen a peak in new in­fec­tions and could con­tain the out­break by Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>But crit­ics have at­trib­uted that de­cline to lower rates of test­ing as the dis­ease spreads to the coun­try’s vast hin­ter­land.</p>
    <p>All ex­ist­ing visas – ex­cept elec­tronic visas, tourist visas and med­i­cal visas – will be re­stored im­me­di­ately, the govern­ment said.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple hold­ing ex­pired visas can ap­ply again and for­eign­ers wish­ing to visit for busi­ness, con­fer­ences, work, study, re­search or med­i­cal rea­sons will be al­lowed to ap­ply, the govern­ment said.</p>
    <p>In­dia has ex­tended a govern­ment repa­tri­a­tion pro­gramme to al­low pri­vate car­ri­ers in­clud­ing In­terGlobe Avi­a­tion’s IndiGo and SpiceJet to op­er­ate such flights with spe­cial per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The na­tion has also struck air-bub­ble agree­ments with 18 coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States, Bri­tain, Ger­many, Afghanista­n and Canada.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s lock­down at the end of March was the world’s largest and one of its most se­vere, caus­ing the econ­omy to con­tract about 24 per cent in the June quar­ter from a year ago as busi­nesses and jobs were de­mol­ished.</p>
    <p>Once re­stric­tions were eased, the au­thor­i­ties strug­gled to get the pan­demic un­der con­trol with the num­ber of in­fec­tions now sec­ond only to the US.</p>
    <p>In­dia has also been al­low­ing lo­cal air­lines to fly a lim­ited sched­ule since May. But most car­ri­ers failed to fill even 70 per cent of their seats last month as pas­sen­gers re­main wary about catch­ing the deadly virus.</p>
