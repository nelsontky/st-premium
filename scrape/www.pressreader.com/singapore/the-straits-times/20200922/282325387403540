    <p>ROME • Top seed Si­mona Halep claimed the Ital­ian Open in Rome for the first time yes­ter­day af­ter sec­ond seed Karolina Pliskova re­tired from the fi­nal ow­ing to in­jury when she was down 6-0, 2-1.</p>
    <p>Halep raced into a 5-0 lead in the open­ing set, break­ing the defending champion three times and also saved three break points at 0-40 down in the fourth game.</p>
    <p>The Ro­ma­nian, who shook off a hard fall in the sec­ond game, was at her ag­gres­sive and dis­ci­plined best while Pliskova looked slug­gish with her on-court move­ment, fail­ing to hit a sin­gle win­ner as she was white­washed in 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Halep has now ex­tended her win­ning streak this sea­son to 14 vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old said to Pliskova af­ter the match: “It’s not the way we want to fin­ish a tour­na­ment, in the fi­nal, you played great this week.</p>
    <p>“I wish you a fast re­cov­ery and wish you good luck at the French Open, maybe we will meet again there in the fi­nal.”</p>
    <p>World No. 2 Halep was com­pet­ing in her third Rome WTA fi­nal, hav­ing fin­ished run­ner-up in 2017 and 2018 on the clay at the Foro Ital­ico.</p>
    <p>The Wim­ble­don champion’s 22nd ca­reer ti­tle comes just a week be­fore the start of the French Open, which she won in 2018.</p>
    <p>She will also be the top seed at Roland Gar­ros in the ab­sence of world No. 1 and defending champion Ash­leigh Barty, who has de­cided against trav­el­ling from Aus­tralia be­cause of coro­n­avirus con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory also gave Halep her third con­sec­u­tive ti­tle of the year af­ter wins in Dubai be­fore the Covid-19 hia­tus and Prague last month.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Pliskova’s re­tire­ment, the lim­ited num­ber of fans al­lowed at cen­tre court urged her to make it a con­test, ap­plaud­ing the rare points she got on the score­board, and it seemed to work as the sec­ond set started with the pair break­ing each other.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Czech was clearly strug­gling with an in­jury with her left thigh ban­daged, and de­spite re­ceiv­ing some treat­ment be­tween sets on her lower back and leg, she opted to re­tire.</p>
    <p>For­mer world No. 1 Pliskova, now No. 4, had been hav­ing a suc­cess­ful week on clay af­ter her dis­ap­point­ing sec­ond-round exit at the US Open, where she was the top seed.</p>
    <p>“It is dis­ap­point­ing not to fin­ish to­day but Si­mona was too strong. I have to be ready 100 per cent to play a good match against her,” she said.</p>
