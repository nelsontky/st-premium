    <p>China’s pursuit of tech­no­log­i­cal self-re­liance and de­sire to be a leader in in­no­va­tion is not an ex­clu­sive or closed-door at­tempt, Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Min­is­ter Wang Zhi­gang said yes­ter­day as he out­lined the coun­try’s devel­op­ment plans over the next five years.</p>
    <p>Be­ing self-re­liant and em­pha­sis­ing in­de­pen­dent in­no­va­tion were “not in con­flict with open­ness and co­op­er­a­tion”, Mr Wang told re­porters.</p>
    <p>He was among a panel of se­nior</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials brief­ing jour­nal­ists a day af­ter a high-level closed­door meet­ing of Com­mu­nist Party lead­ers.</p>
    <p>A com­mu­nique of the meet­ing re­leased on Thurs­day said that top party of­fi­cials had stressed the im­por­tance of tech­no­log­i­cal in­de­pen­dence in China’s devel­op­ment pri­or­i­ties over the next half-decade – known here as the 14th Five-Year Plan.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang yes­ter­day sought to dis­pel the no­tion that the coun­try was go­ing to hun­ker down and close it­self off to the world.</p>
    <p>“China’s pursuit of in­no­va­tion has never been en­closed or ex­clu­sive. It is based on mu­tual re­spect, mu­tual learn­ing; we will not shut our door to the world in pur­su­ing in­no­va­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing would learn from ad­vanced for­eign part­ners and also share China’s tech­no­log­i­cal devel­op­ments with the world, he said.</p>
    <p>“We are ready to en­gage in di­a­logue and ex­changes with all coun­tries on tech­no­log­i­cal poli­cies, devel­op­ment plan­ning, sci­ence, ethics and other im­por­tant top­ics in this field,” he said.</p>
    <p>Say­ing that China had en­tered a new phase of devel­op­ment and needed a “new devel­op­ment par­a­digm”, Mr Wang pointed out this was the first time that a Five-Year Plan had an en­tire chap­ter ded­i­cated to sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>HSBC econ­o­mists had in a re­search note on Tues­day high­lighted the im­por­tance of in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion in China’s quest to climb the tech­nol­ogy lad­der, point­ing out that in­creased en­gage­ment “can lead to more tech­nol­ogy dif­fu­sion”.</p>
    <p>The just-ended meet­ing of the party’s Cen­tral Com­mit­tee – known as the Fifth Plenum – is be­ing closely watched by ob­servers for China’s fu­ture devel­op­ment pri­or­i­ties as it re­sponds to chal­lenges posed by ten­sions with the United States and the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At yes­ter­day’s brief­ing, Mr Han Wenxiu, deputy di­rec­tor of the Of­fice of the Cen­tral Fi­nan­cial and Eco­nomic Af­fairs Com­mis­sion, said that along with Covid-19, China also faced ex­ter­nal chal­lenges like ris­ing uni­lat­er­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>He said the coun­try needed to shore up its re­silience by boost­ing its do­mes­tic econ­omy while ex­plain­ing the new “dual cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>He re­jected the no­tion that this meant for­eign mar­kets would be less im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“On the con­trary, what can be ex­pected is con­tin­ued in­crease of im­ports and ex­ports in for­eign in­vest­ment and in out­bound Chi­nese in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>“This will el­e­vate China’s stand­ing in­ter­na­tion­ally,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing US-China ten­sions, he said com­plete de­cou­pling of the world’s two big­gest economies was “not re­al­is­tic at all”.</p>
    <p>Mr Han said: “It does no good for China, the US and the whole world.</p>
    <p>“The truth is very few would re­ally want to see the two coun­tries de­cou­ple. Most would want our two coun­tries to co­op­er­ate and work to­gether.”</p>
