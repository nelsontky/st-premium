    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain has re­turned three an­tique bronze sculp­tures to the In­dian au­thor­i­ties more than 40 years af­ter they were stolen from a Hindu tem­ple in the south­ern In­dian state of Tamil Nadu.</p>
    <p>Four bronzes from the Vi­jayana­gara pe­riod, which lasted from the 14th to the 17th cen­turies, were stolen in 1978 from a tem­ple ded­i­cated to the god Vishnu in Na­ga­p­at­ti­nam.</p>
    <p>The thieves were con­victed in In­dia at the time, but it was only last year that three of the stat­ues were found, when the In­dian High Com­mis­sion in Lon­don dis­cov­ered that one of them was be­ing of­fered for sale by a Bri­tish-based dealer.</p>
    <p>Alerted by the em­bassy, the Met­ro­pol­i­tan Po­lice’s Art and An­tiques Unit in­ves­ti­gated and was able to es­tab­lish that the dealer had pur­chased the item in good faith.</p>
    <p>Once he had been shown ev­i­dence that the bronze had been stolen, he vol­un­tar­ily handed over the sculp­ture, and iden­ti­fied two ad­di­tional ones from the same group, the po­lice said. All three will now be re­turned to their home­land.</p>
    <p>The In­dian High Com­mis­sion tweeted pho­to­graphs of the stat­ues, taken dur­ing a for­mal han­dover to the gov­ern­ment of Tamil Nadu, describing the event as an “aus­pi­cious mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>The Met­ro­pol­i­tan Po­lice said it was proud to have been in­volved in the re­turn of the bronzes to In­dia.</p>
    <p>“Not only are they beau­ti­ful and his­tor­i­cally sig­nif­i­cant, they are, of course, of re­li­gious im­por­tance, so it’s par­tic­u­larly grat­i­fy­ing that they are to be re­turned to the tem­ple from which they were taken,” said De­tec­tive Chief In­spec­tor Tim Wright.</p>
