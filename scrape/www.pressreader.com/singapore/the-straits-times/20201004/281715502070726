    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat will not be un­veil­ing a new round of sup­port mea­sures when he makes a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment to­mor­row, but will speak about how re­sources will be al­lo­cated to fund the mea­sures al­ready an­nounced.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated this in a Face­book post yes­ter­day, as he noted the an­nounce­ment about the min­is­te­rial state­ment had sparked ques­tions about whether there would be a forth­com­ing round of mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In his post, Mr Heng said the main pur­pose of his state­ment will be to pro­vide the con­text for the Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply Bill that will be in­tro­duced in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The third such Bill to be tabled this year, it will re­al­lo­cate re­sources for the mea­sures an­nounced on Aug 17 to help tide busi­nesses and work­ers over the eco­nomic dis­rup­tion brought by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment will de­bate the Bill as well as these mea­sures, which amount to about $8 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, said yes­ter­day: “At this stage of the cri­sis, my team and I are fully com­mit­ted to sup­port our work­ers and busi­nesses by re­fin­ing our poli­cies, ex­pand­ing out­reach and im­prov­ing im­ple­men­ta­tion, to make the most of the $100 bil­lion com­mit­ted to the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We hope that busi­nesses and work­ers can make the best use of the mea­sures that have been com­mit­ted.”</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Mr Heng had met</p>
    <p>FULLY COM­MIT­TED</p>
    <p>some small and medium-sized en­ter­prises as well as union lead­ers and ca­reer coaches, with labour chief Ng Chee Meng.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said these meet­ings had “given us a bet­ter sense of the pain points of job seek­ers and busi­nesses, op­por­tu­ni­ties for col­lab­o­ra­tion in the com­ing months, and new ideas that we can de­velop for Bud­get next year”.</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment would work closely with busi­nesses to help them stay vi­able and keep work­ers em­ployed.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has com­mit­ted close to $100 bil­lion over four Bud­gets and a fur­ther round of sup­port in Au­gust, to help tide busi­nesses, work­ers and house­holds over the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Among the key mea­sures an­nounced in Au­gust were ad­just­ments to the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which was meant to help em­ploy­ers fund up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each lo­cal em­ployee, for 10 months up to Au­gust 2020.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures have ex­tended wage sup­port un­til March next year, tiered based on how quickly each sec­tor is ex­pected to re­cover.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, in­tro­duced in May to help Sin­ga­pore­ans who have been laid off or suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss, was ex­tended to De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng had said the mea­sures would be funded by the re­al­lo­ca­tion of monies from other ar­eas, such as de­vel­op­ment ex­pen­di­tures that were de­layed due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>At this stage of the cri­sis, my team and I are fully com­mit­ted to sup­port our work­ers and busi­nesses by re­fin­ing our poli­cies, ex­pand­ing out­reach and im­prov­ing im­ple­men­ta­tion, to make the most of the $100 bil­lion com­mit­ted to the fight against Covid-19. We hope that busi­nesses and work­ers can make the best use of the mea­sures that have been com­mit­ted.</p>
