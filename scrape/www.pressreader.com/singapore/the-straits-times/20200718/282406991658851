    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Turf Club (STC) has can­celled the li­cences of jock­eys Michael Rodd, Pa­trick Moloney and Alysha Col­lett, af­ter the trio in­di­cated that they would not re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to ride this year.</p>
    <p>The three ex­pa­tri­ate jock­eys were li­censed un­til the end of the year, but they have in­formed the STC that they were re­lin­quish­ing their vis­it­ing jock­eys’ li­cences.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralians Rodd and Moloney re­turned to their for­mer Vic­to­rian bases in late April. They have rid­den win­ners since their re­turn.</p>
    <p>New Zealan­der Col­lett picked Syd­ney, where her el­der brother Ja­son is based. She has also rid­den win­ners since then.</p>
    <p>The com­mon push fac­tor for the trio’s de­par­ture was the sus­pen­sion of Sin­ga­pore rac­ing due to the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker on April 7.</p>
    <p>They had said the en­forced break had cast their rid­ing ca­reers and fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tions into un­cer­tainty. Jock­eys earn rid­ing fees and stake­money from races.</p>
    <p>Horse rac­ing in Aus­tralia went on un­in­ter­rupted dur­ing the pan­demic, al­beit races were con­ducted be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>An­other STC-li­censed Aus­tralian jockey, Daniel Moor, left a cou­ple of weeks be­fore Rodd, Moloney and Col­lett for the same rea­son.</p>
    <p>But, un­like his three col­leagues, who had hoped to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore when the sit­u­a­tion cleared up, the Vic­to­rian jockey de­cided to sur­ren­der his li­cence.</p>
    <p>He left with two win­ners and 13 plac­ings from 70 rides.</p>
    <p>Rodd, who won many Group races dur­ing his few years in Sin­ga­pore, has rid­den 16 win­ners and 26 plac­ings from 99 rides at Kranji.</p>
    <p>Moloney has eight wins and 15 plac­ings from 95 rides. Col­lett has the most num­ber of rides – 118 – for seven wins and 20 plac­ings.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore rac­ing re­sumed be­hind closed doors last Satur­day, with a record 14-race pro­gramme con­sist­ing of a record 167 run­ners.</p>
