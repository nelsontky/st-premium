    <p>NEW YORK • More than US$722 bil­lion (S$964 bil­lion) worth of Chi­nese stocks will be un­locked for sale next year, test­ing a mar­ket where val­u­a­tions are at a five-year high.</p>
    <p>That would be the largest amount since at least 2011, ac­cord­ing to China Mer­chants Se­cu­ri­ties. It is also equiv­a­lent to about 7 per cent of the value of the en­tire Chi­nese eq­uity mar­ket, data com­piled by Bloomberg shows.</p>
    <p>From ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPOs) to ad­di­tional place­ments, China’s cash-hun­gry com­pa­nies have been en­cour­aged by Bei­jing to raise funds by sell­ing new shares.</p>
    <p>There has also been a rush of ad­di­tional sales by firms look­ing to avoid the tur­moil in the na­tion’s debt mar­ket.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the num­ber of re­stricted shares held by ma­jor share­hold­ers, se­nior ex­ec­u­tives and early in­vestors is swelling, driven by Bei­jing’s mar­ket re­forms and looser reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“More com­pa­nies are go­ing to is­sue shares to raise funds, es­pe­cially af­ter the ris­ing de­fault prob­lems in the credit mar­ket,” said Cap­i­tal Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Amy Lin. “That means more re­stricted shares be­ing un­locked in the fu­ture, which will be an is­sue af­fect­ing the mar­ket for a long time.”</p>
    <p>In China, re­stricted stocks usu­ally have a lock-up pe­riod of any­thing be­tween six months and three years af­ter the date of list­ing. And when un­leashed for com­pany in­sid­ers to sell, the rest of the mar­ket can feel the im­pact.</p>
    <p>A gauge track­ing the Star mar­ket fell 8.2 per cent in the three trad­ing days af­ter its one-year an­niver­sary in July, when com­pany in­sid­ers took their first chance to sell. That dragged the coun­try’s bench­mark CSI 300 In­dex down by 4 per cent dur­ing the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, three com­pa­nies saw their stocks fall af­ter an­nounc­ing eq­uity sale plans by hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Next year will see a con­cen­tra­tion of un­locks in the sec­ond and third quar­ters, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent In­dus­trial Se­cu­ri­ties re­search note. Com­pa­nies in elec­tron­ics, medicine and biotech­nol­ogy, and bro­ker­age in­dus­tries face the high­est value of un­locks next year, ac­cord­ing to China In­ter­na­tional Cap­i­tal Corp (CICC), which said in a note that it ex­pects a large amount of shares freed up on the main board in June and on the Star board in July.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese com­pa­nies have raised 438 bil­lion yuan (S$90 bil­lion) from A-share IPOs this year, the high­est level since 2010, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg-com­piled data. This year the vol­ume of pri­vate share place­ments hit the high­est level since 2017.</p>
    <p>The five com­pa­nies fac­ing the largest amount of un­locks next year are Con­tem­po­rary Am­perex Tech­nol­ogy, Shen­zhen Min­dray Bio-Med­i­cal Elec­tron­ics, Fox­conn In­dus­trial In­ter­net, CSC Fi­nan­cial and Peo­ple’s In­sur­ance Co Group of China, with at least 198 bil­lion yuan of shares to be un­locked each, CICC says.</p>
    <p>To be sure, while the mar­ket faces grow­ing pres­sure from un­locks and in­sider sell­ing, an­a­lysts be­lieve a pos­i­tive outlook for China’s stock mar­ket next year could partly off­set the im­pact, es­pe­cially as the econ­omy con­tin­ues its re­cov­ery from the virus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts at China Mer­chants Se­cu­ri­ties ex­pect more than one tril­lion yuan of funds to flow into A shares via mu­tual funds and over­seas in­vestors.</p>
    <p>But the re­lease of more pre­vi­ously re­stricted shares will still pres­sure the mar­ket, said Bei­jing WanDeFu In­vest­ment Man­age­ment chair­man Li Shuwei. “I would be wary of in­vest­ing in stocks with high val­u­a­tions and high pro­por­tions of shares wait­ing to be un­locked,” he said.</p>
