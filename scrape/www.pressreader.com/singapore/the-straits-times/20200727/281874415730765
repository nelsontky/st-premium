    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysian busi­ness­man Lim Wee Chai is cer­tainly the man of the hour. He is go­ing places no other Malaysian ty­coons have gone.</p>
    <p>The boss of Top Glove Cor­po­ra­tion, the world’s largest glove man­u­fac­turer, has found his com­pany placed as the third-largest in mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion on Bursa Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Top Glove was in sec­ond spot, but slipped to third when Bursa closed the next day, with Public Bank tak­ing over.</p>
    <p>At pole po­si­tion is still May­bank, which had a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of RM88.244 bil­lion (S$28.8 bil­lion), com­pared with Top Glove’s at RM70.466 bil­lion last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>May­bank’s share price closed at RM7.85 last Fri­day against Top Glove’s RM25.44.</p>
    <p>Top Glove was at No. 9 on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change last Thurs­day, out­rank­ing big­ger names such as Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Cap­i­taLand.</p>
    <p>Top Glove is ex­pected to cre­ate Malaysian his­tory soon by an­nounc­ing the big­gest jump in quar­terly profit for a listed com­pany.</p>
    <p>Malaysians are closely watch­ing the surge in Top Glove’s share price and Tan Sri Lim’s wealth, which has been grow­ing by the mil­lions in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The real-time world bil­lion­aire rank­ing now has him at No. 443 in a list of 2,095 of the world’s rich­est peo­ple, with wealth of at least US$5.2 bil­lion (S$7.2 bil­lion) as of last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old, a physics grad­u­ate from the Univer­sity of Malaya, is ranked Malaysia’s 14th-rich­est per­son this year.</p>
    <p>By now, many for­eign­ers would have sat up and taken note of Mr Lim and his in­cred­i­ble show­ing on the stock mar­ket due to the de­mand for his rub­ber prod­ucts amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Un­like most ty­coons, who are ei­ther reclu­sive, ec­cen­tric, heav­ily guarded or flam­boy­ant, Mr Lim leads a mod­est lifestyle.</p>
    <p>Like fel­low ty­coon Vin­cent Tan, he is a strong sup­porter of Tzu Chi, a Bud­dhist char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tion head­quar­tered in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence of serv­ing Tzu Chi, he said he could raise only</p>
    <p>RM36 in do­na­tions af­ter walk­ing the streets for two hours on his first out­ing. “No­body knew me and few do­nated. But that frus­tra­tion did not dampen my en­thu­si­asm to carry out good and mean­ing­ful work,” he said in an in­ter­view with The Star.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim of­ten re­minds peo­ple – es­pe­cially those meet­ing him for the first time – to take care of their health. “Rule No. 1, stay fit and healthy!” was his open­ing line at a talk given to en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>“When you are sick, you don’t earn any­thing, and you con­tinue to have to spend money on fixed ex­penses on top of med­i­cal costs. But when you’re healthy, you can add</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view, Mr Lim said his goal was to stay healthy and live un­til 100. He at­trib­uted his wealth to his pri­ori­ti­sa­tion of men­tal and phys­i­cal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>He ex­er­cises four days a week and prac­tises what he calls “five qual­ity wells”: clean well, eat well, work well, ex­er­cise well and sleep well.</p>
    <p>His com­pany mon­i­tors the body mass in­dex of its staff and has a pol­icy of not hir­ing smok­ers. Its cafe­te­ria menu is de­signed by nu­tri­tion­ists.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said fail­ure was not an op­tion when he and his wife started the com­pany in 1991 with their en­tire sav­ings of just RM180,000, and with­out a backup plan.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, as his par­ents owned a small rub­ber plan­ta­tion, he was ex­posed to the rub­ber trade from an early age in the small town of Titi in Negeri Sem­bi­lan.</p>
    <p>To­day, Top Glove con­trols 26 per cent of the world’s rub­ber glove mar­ket, with 43 fac­to­ries world­wide and an an­nual pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity of over 70.5 bil­lion gloves.</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery­one, es­pe­cially in Kuala Lumpur, Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong, is hold­ing their breath to see how Top Glove per­forms next, and whether its shares will sur­pass the RM30 mark and set a new record for be­ing on top.</p>
    <p>This is not ex­actly a rags-toriches tale, but cer­tainly a fan­tas­tic story of a small-town man be­com­ing one of the rich­est peo­ple in the world deal­ing with a com­mod­ity Malaysia knows best – rub­ber.</p>
    <p>THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NET­WORK</p>
    <p>A search and res­cue op­er­a­tion was launched, but an of­fi­cial said no bod­ies or sur­vivors were found. It is not clear what hap­pened to the boat.</p>
