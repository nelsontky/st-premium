    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei said ac­tion will be taken against those who leaked an au­dio record­ing of its vir­tual ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) held on Mon­day night, de­spite re­peated in­struc­tions that the pro­ceed­ings were pri­vate and con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) is in­ves­ti­gat­ing a leaked au­dio record­ing of its ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EOGM) on Mon­day night, dur­ing which a re­view of its con­sti­tu­tion was car­ried out.</p>
    <p>SA pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei told The Straits Times on Thurs­day night that it was “made clear re­peat­edly” to all af­fil­i­ate mem­bers at­tend­ing the vir­tual meet­ing that pro­ceed­ings of gen­eral meet­ings are pri­vate and con­fi­den­tial.</p>
    <p>He said: “There were strict profession­al in­struc­tions and con­di­tions pro­vided to the mem­bers be­fore the EOGM, and re­it­er­ated at least twice dur­ing the EOGM, but the profession­al stan­dards were not ad­hered to by cer­tain mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“Ac­tions will have to be taken to make those who were re­spon­si­ble ac­count for their con­duct, as con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion was im­parted (by all at­tend­ing) on the com­mon un­der­stand­ing and obli­ga­tion of con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>Twenty of SA’s 23 af­fil­i­ate mem­bers – plus an­other 15 as­so­ciate mem­bers – were rep­re­sented dur­ing the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Each club was al­lowed to have two rep­re­sen­ta­tives at the EOGM, which lasted about five hours.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, a three-hour long au­dio record­ing made the rounds.</p>
    <p>The clip was later shared by na­tional marathoner Soh Rui Yong – who sued SA for defama­tion last year over its state­ment on his non­s­e­lec­tion for the 2019 SEA Games in the Philip­pines – in a Face­book post, in which he ques­tioned a state­ment Tang had made about one of the pro­posed amend­ments to SA’s con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>In the clip, Tang was heard re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from Ron Koh, the honorary sec­re­tary of Wings Ath­let­ics Club, on why SA pro­posed re­mov­ing the vot­ing rights of its ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive. The mooted change was one of sev­eral that had sparked con­cern among some clubs ear­lier.</p>

    <p>Ac­tions will have to be taken to make those who were re­spon­si­ble ac­count for their con­duct, as con­fi­den­tial in­for­ma­tion was im­parted (by all at­tend­ing) on the com­mon un­der­stand­ing and obli­ga­tion of con­fi­dence.</p>
