    <p>With five Asians in the Rolex world’s top-10 rank­ings and 13 in the top20 slots, the con­ti­nent’s prow­ess in women’s golf is undis­puted.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tion for his was laid by South Korean five-time Ma­jor win­ner Pak Se Ri, who made the break­through in 1998 with her US Open and US PGA Cham­pi­onships as a 21-year-old.</p>
    <p>Since then her coun­try­women have dom­i­nated world golf with sev­eral hit­ting the No. 1 spot over the last 25 years, with many also mak­ing their homes in the United States.</p>
    <p>Then fol­lowed a slate of Thai, Ja­panese, Tai­wanese and Chi­nese play­ers who joined the South Kore­ans in keep­ing the con­ti­nent’s flag fly­ing.</p>
    <p>Early this month, two South­east Asians hit the head­lines with their stu­pen­dous show­ings in the Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onships when Filip­ina Bianca Pag­dan­ga­man (tied­ninth, win­ning US$83,765) and Malaysian Kelly Tan (tied-13th, win­ning US$63,820).</p>
    <p>In fact, Tan 26, shared the lead with Amer­i­can Brit­tany Lin­ci­come af­ter the first day with a three-un­der 67 in Penn­syl­va­nia while Pag­dan­ga­man, 22, gained a spot for next month’s US Open with her top-10 fin­ish.</p>
    <p>This Asian re­nais­sance raised a talk­ing point among lo­cal golfers as to why Sin­ga­pore women golfers aren’t fea­tured in this tra­di­tion when size and build seem to fea­ture not so highly in th­ese “women war­riors”.</p>
    <p>Ba­si­cally, it is a ques­tion of op­por­tu­ni­ties and spon­sor­ships in the real life sce­nario of “chicken and egg” de­bate. “Show your worth be­fore we back you” seems to be the for­mula adopted by the big spon­sors.</p>
    <p>But this is the break­through that Sin­ga­pore women golfers find hard to make although some like Koh Sock Hwee, 30, had shown early teen promise and is still go­ing for it.</p>
    <p>The two-time South-east Asian Games bronze medal­list hit a snag when she turned pro in 2016 when money woes hin­dered her plans in many Tours, in­clud­ing her dream of play­ing in the US.</p>
    <p>Koh, who grad­u­ated in 2012 with a de­gree in project and fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, sup­ple­mented her in­come by giv­ing tu­ition. That did al­le­vi­ate some of her fi­nan­cial wor­ries, but the chal­lenge to play abroad still re­mains a ma­jor hur­dle.</p>
    <p>Un­til the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Koh was play­ing in China and Tai­wan, and although events in the two coun­tries had re­sumed, bor­der con­trols pre­vent Koh from trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Koh is en­joy­ing her play­ing and prac­tis­ing priv­i­leges at Sen­tosa Golf Club and earns some in­come from her teach­ing at the Na­tional Ser­vice Re­sort and Coun­try Club.</p>
    <p>In a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion is Amanda Tan, 20, a promis­ing pro who prac­tises at Sen­tosa Golf Club and takes lessons from Bris­bane-based Aus­tralian coach Ian Triggs who pro­vides on­line ad­vice as travel has been re­stricted.</p>
    <p>There are four other women play­ers reg­is­tered with the Sin­ga­pore Pro­fes­sional Golfers’ As­so­ci­a­tion, namely Amelia Yong, Joey Poh, Khee Jiali and El­iz­a­beth Ang.</p>
