    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s King is set to play a key role in what hap­pens next af­ter op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim claimed he had ma­jor­ity sup­port to form a gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The monarch, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, plans to hold an au­di­ence with Datuk Seri An­war soon to give him the op­por­tu­nity to prove his as­ser­tion, af­ter post­pon­ing a Tues­day meet­ing for health rea­sons. There is no ex­act time set yet.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has main­tained that he is still the le­git­i­mate leader and de­nounced Mr An­war’s at­tempt to desta­bilise the coun­try’s pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Here are a few ways the King could de­cide to re­solve the im­passe:</p>
    <p>CALL AN ELEC­TION</p>
    <p>The King has the power to dis­solve Par­lia­ment, af­ter which an elec­tion must be held within 60 days. Law­mak­ers from the rul­ing and op­po­si­tion coali­tions have called for snap polls to re­solve the po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty once and for all, as Tan Sri Muhyid­din was sworn into of­fice in March fol­low­ing the col­lapse of a gov­ern­ment that took power af­ter the 2018 Gen­eral Elec­tion. Mr Muhyid­din could also call an elec­tion, which he ear­lier said he might do if his coali­tion wins the Sabah state polls tomorrow.</p>
    <p>SEEK NO-CON­FI­DENCE VOTE</p>
    <p>The monarch could re­quest the Speaker of the Lower House to bring for­ward the next par­lia­men­tary sit­ting, cur­rently set for Nov 2, to hold a vote of no con­fi­dence ear­lier. The op­po­si­tion has been plan­ning to chal­lenge Mr Muhyid­din’s sup­port in Par­lia­ment for months, but the Speaker has re­peat­edly placed the mo­tion at the bot­tom of the agenda. In July, Mr Muhyid­din proved he held a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment when he re­placed the Speaker.</p>
    <p>AP­POINT PRIME MIN­IS­TER</p>
    <p>Af­ter former premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad abruptly re­signed in Fe­bru­ary, the King spent days speak­ing with each law­maker to find out who they sup­port, which led to Mr Muhyid­din’s ap­point­ment. This time, there is no lead­er­ship vacuum, so the monarch may need to urge the cur­rent premier to step down if Mr An­war has the back­ing of a ma­jor­ity of law­mak­ers in Par­lia­ment.</p>
