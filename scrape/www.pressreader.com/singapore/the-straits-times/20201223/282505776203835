    <p>• World football gov­ern­ing body Fifa has filed a crim­i­nal com­plaint with Zurich’s can­tonal prose­cu­tor, claim­ing ev­i­dence of “crim­i­nal mis­man­age­ment” of a mu­seum project set up by for­mer pres­i­dent Sepp Blat­ter.</p>
    <p>Fifa said its com­plaint “iden­ti­fied the di­rect in­volve­ment of for­mer Fifa pres­i­dent Blat­ter to­gether with other per­sons” in the agree­ments made for the mu­seum, which is in cen­tral Zurich.</p>
    <p>A state­ment read: “The com­plaint in­cludes the en­tire project costs at 500 mil­lion Swiss francs (S$753 mil­lion), and iden­ti­fies that the pre­vi­ous Fifa ad­min­is­tra­tion poured 140 mil­lion Swiss francs into ren­o­vat­ing and re­fur­bish­ing a build­ing that the or­gan­i­sa­tion doesn’t own.</p>
    <p>“While also lock­ing it­self into a long-term rental agree­ment on un­favourable terms when com­pared to stan­dard mar­ket rates, which, in to­tal, will cost Fifa 360 mil­lion Swiss francs by the date of ex­pi­ra­tion in 2045. That is half a bil­lion Swiss francs that could and should have been chan­nelled into the devel­op­ment of global football.”</p>
    <p>Lorenz Erni, Blat­ter’s lawyer, said in re­sponse: “The ac­cu­sa­tions are base­less and are ve­he­mently re­pu­di­ated.”</p>
    <p>Blat­ter, 84, was sus­pended and later banned by Fifa’s ethics com­mit­tee af­ter the Swiss be­came the sub­ject of crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings in</p>
    <p>Switzer­land in 2015.</p>
    <p>Fifa deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral Alas­dair Bell said that a “foren­sic au­dit” had been un­der­taken into the project.</p>
    <p>“That au­dit re­vealed a wide range of sus­pi­cious cir­cum­stances and man­age­ment fail­ures, some of which may be crim­i­nal in na­ture and which there­fore need to be prop­erly in­ves­ti­gated,” he added.</p>
    <p>Fifa said it also plans to sub­mit all rel­e­vant doc­u­men­ta­tion to its own ethics com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent Fifa pres­i­dent Gianni In­fantino is him­self fac­ing crim­i­nal pro­ceed­ings by a spe­cial prose­cu­tor look­ing into deal­ings the Swis­sI­tal­ian had with for­mer Swiss at­tor­ney-gen­eral Michael Lauber.</p>
    <p>The pair have de­nied any wrong­do­ing, but ear­lier this month, spe­cial prose­cu­tor Ste­fan Keller said he had asked Swiss au­thor­i­ties to in­ves­ti­gate In­fantino’s use of pri­vate air travel. Fifa, in re­sponse, claimed it would “take all nec­es­sary le­gal steps and reme­dies to put an end to these base­less and illinten­tioned ac­cu­sa­tions”.</p>
