    <p>Some users of In­ter­net ser­vice provider MyRepublic were hit by a broad­band out­age on Thurs­day morning and there were re­ports of the prob­lem con­tin­u­ing for more than 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Con­nec­tiv­ity is­sues were re­port­edly ex­pe­ri­enced from 7.34am on New Year’s Eve by users in var­i­ous lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing Yishun, Sengkang and Yio Chu Kang.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a spokesman for MyRepublic said yes­ter­day that fewer than 100 sub­scribers, which made up 0.1 per cent of its users, were af­fected.</p>
    <p>A small num­ber of them still had con­nec­tiv­ity is­sues, and these were be­ing han­dled on a case-by-case ba­sis, he added.</p>
    <p>The In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity was also up­dated on the out­age, in line with the com­pany’s poli­cies and reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, MyRepublic ac­knowl­edged the gl­itch in a Face­book post at 10.55am.</p>
    <p>In an up­date at 1.48pm on the same day, it said con­nec­tiv­ity was re­stored and it ad­vised cus­tomers who were still fac­ing these is­sues to switch off their op­ti­cal net­work ter­mi­nal and router for 10 min­utes be­fore turn­ing them on.</p>
    <p>But sev­eral cus­tomers said on Face­book that they were still un­able to con­nect to the In­ter­net yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It still wasn’t work­ing when I tried this morning around 9.50am,” said Mr Alvin Ong, 40, who lives in Sengkang. Since 7.45am on Thurs­day, the man­ager at a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion has tried restart­ing as in­structed at least eight times.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, a sub­scriber for around six years, said MyRepublic “should share why the dis­rup­tion oc­curred and when ser­vice will be re­stored”.</p>
