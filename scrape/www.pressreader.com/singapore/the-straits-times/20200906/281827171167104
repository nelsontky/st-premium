    <p>The ex­hil­a­rat­ing and loud world of mo­tor­cy­cle rac­ing fell silent in the first quar­ter of this year with the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>But in July, Mo­toGP, the premier class of mo­tor­cy­cle rac­ing, restarted the world cham­pi­onship in Spain af­ter a four-month hia­tus.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, lo­cal mo­tor­cy­cle event or­gan­iser Sing­amoto in­tends to kick-start two-wheel rac­ing by hold­ing a track day at the 960m-long KF1</p>
    <p>Kart­ing Cir­cuit in Kranji this month.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor Sports Sin­ga­pore (MSS), the rul­ing body for mo­tor sports here, told The Sun­day Times that the event is sched­uled for Sept 19, pro­vided it is sat­is­fied with the or­gan­iser’s safe man­age­ment plan.</p>
    <p>Said Mr K. Thamod­ha­ran, vi­cepres­i­dent for mo­tor­cy­cle sport at MSS: “Be­ing the first mo­tor sports event to re­sume in the cur­rent phase, the other sport­ing com­mis­sions will be ob­serv­ing how the event is held safely and how their event (if any) could im­prove on the safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“It is vi­tal that we all learn from each other as this will be the new nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>Among the events can­celled this year is the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix, which was sched­uled for Sept 20.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to March this year, Sing­amoto had or­gan­ised one mo­tor­cy­cle race and two track days, which are non-com­pet­i­tive rid­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Ab­dul Kha­lik Nordin, 41, who is or­gan­is­ing the Sing­amoto Track Day in Kranji, said that the full-day track event will fea­ture sev­eral rid­ing cat­e­gories, such as su­per­moto, un­der­bone and scoot­ers.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery one will be watch­ing us on our trial run,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have to make sure the event goes smoothly and par­tic­i­pants abide by the safety reg­u­la­tions so that there will be more of such events de­spite the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Past events con­ducted by Sing­amoto have seen about 120 par­tic­i­pants and about 2,000 spec­ta­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­ham­mad Fa­zli Ka­marud­din, co-or­gan­iser of the event, said the plan is to have no more than 25 rid­ers in each cat­e­gory race for 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“Like Mo­toGP, there will be no spec­ta­tors at the cir­cuit,” said Mr Fa­zli, 37.</p>
    <p>“I know spec­ta­tors and rid­ers’ sup­port­ers will be dis­ap­pointed, but we will stream the ses­sion live on Face­book.”</p>
    <p>A max­i­mum of 50 peo­ple – in­clud­ing mar­shals, event and cir­cuit staff, par­tic­i­pants and me­chan­ics – are al­lowed at any one time on the premises.</p>
    <p>Safe man­age­ment of­fi­cers will be</p>
    <p>present to en­sure that safe en­try pro­ce­dures and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are ob­served.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants, who are re­quired to wear masks be­fore get­ting on the grid, must ar­rive at the venue at their al­lot­ted times.</p>
    <p>All their move­ments at the cir­cuit will be re­stricted and they will be herded into hold­ing ar­eas be­fore the start of each rid­ing ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Thamod­ha­ran: “All mea­sures dur­ing the Sing­amoto event would have been ap­proved prior to the event, hence MSS will be look­ing pri­mar­ily at ad­her­ence to all safe man­age­ment mea­sures, par­tic­i­pant move­ment and con­trol and ad­e­quacy of pre­scribed phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing.”</p>
    <p>Mr Muham­mad Ai­man Sha­harum, 19, who will be rid­ing in the su­per­moto cat­e­gory, said: “Most rid­ers, who have been in­ac­tive for months, have been think­ing about re­turn­ing to the cir­cuit.”</p>
    <p>There will be four videog­ra­phers to cap­ture the track high­lights, and three event me­chan­ics to as­sist rid­ers with mi­nor mo­tor­cy­cle is­sues.</p>
    <p>Once each ses­sion has been com­pleted, the rid­ers must leave the cir­cuit.</p>
