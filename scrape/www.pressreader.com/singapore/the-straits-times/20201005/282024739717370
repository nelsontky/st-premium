    <p>As ath­letes, we train eight to 10 hours a week. We start train­ing at 6am, and then go to school be­fore re­turn­ing to train­ing af­ter classes. We sac­ri­fice time with our friends and fam­ily. But this award tells me that I am on the right track.</p>
    <p>NA­TIONAL PAD­DLER JOVI JAY­DEN KALAICHELV­AN (right), on the ef­forts that go into train­ing and achiev­ing mile­stones.</p>
    <p>On the morn­ing of the first exam for his O lev­els in 2017, na­tional pad­dler Jovi Jay­den Kalaichelv­an’s father died.</p>
    <p>The death and the fam­ily’s fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties took a toll as he con­tin­ued his stud­ies at Na­tional Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>He was re­tained af­ter un­der­per­form­ing in his first year, but Jovi worked hard to get back on his feet.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old mem­ber of the na­tional ca­noe­ing team is now gear­ing up for his A-level ex­ams and hopes to achieve his dream of be­com­ing a pi­lot.</p>
    <p>Jovi, who was recog­nised for his per­se­ver­ance by the Sin­ga­pore In­dian De­vel­op­ment As­so­ci­a­tion (Sinda), re­ceived the Sin­ga­pore Schools Sports Coun­cil (SSSC) Spe­cial Colours Award at the Sinda Ex­cel­lence Awards this year.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 653 achiev­ers were recog­nised across 19 cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing for aca­demic work, arts, sports and tech­ni­cal skills.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a vir­tual com­mem­o­ra­tion of the awards on Sept 26, the pres­i­dent of Sinda, Ms In­dra­nee Ra­jah, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, said education re­mained a pri­or­ity for the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>She said: “This is es­pe­cially sig­nif­i­cant now, in this cur­rent cli­mate of un­cer­tainty, and we will con­tinue to adapt our education ap­proaches, so that our stu­dents will de­velop the re­quired breadth and ver­sa­til­ity, be well-equipped with the right skill sets to ful­fil their as­pi­ra­tions and thrive in the fu­ture econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>For Jovi, the award has strength­ened his re­solve to con­tinue push­ing to­wards his goals.</p>
    <p>He said: “My father en­cour­aged me to be a good ath­lete. On my first overseas race, he kept a record­ing of me and showed it to other peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, sports was an in­te­gral part of life. Jovi’s mother was a for­mer net­ball player, while one of his three sib­lings plays squash and an­other, net­ball.</p>
    <p>Af­ter tak­ing up ca­noe­ing as a cocur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity in sec­ondary school, Jovi’s tal­ent was recog­nised by his school coach and he was tal­ent scouted to join a ju­nior de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme in 2015.</p>
    <p>But the teenager entered a slump af­ter the death of his father, who had pneu­mo­nia and nephrotic syn­drome, a kid­ney dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>Jovi said: “When we lost him, ev­ery­thing felt like a blur. I tried not to think about what had hap­pened, but I could not find the mo­ti­va­tion to study or train.”</p>
    <p>His mother is un­em­ployed so Jovi’s fam­ily gets by on as­sis­tance from the Viriya Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre in Po­tong Pasir. He and his sib­lings also re­ceive fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance from their schools as well as the Education Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on his award, Jovi said: “As ath­letes, we train eight to 10 hours a week. We start train­ing at 6am, and then go to school be­fore re­turn­ing to train­ing af­ter classes. We sac­ri­fice time with our friends and fam­ily. But this award tells me that I am on the right track.”</p>
    <p>“When I hit mile­stones like this, I re­mind my­self that my father would have liked to see the (kind of) peo­ple my sib­lings and I are grow­ing up to be,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sinda has set aside $7 mil­lion till the end of the year to as­sist those in need within the In­dian com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion also plans to give out 1,000 head­phones to help stu­dents with home-based learning in the com­ing months.</p>
