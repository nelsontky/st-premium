    <p>AXA In­sur­ance is plan­ning to exit AXA Tower, with the iconic build­ing set to be re­de­vel­oped. AXA In­sur­ance chief peo­ple of­fi­cer Hay­ley Yap said: “We are mak­ing plans to re­lo­cate our of­fice due to the im­pend­ing re­de­vel­op­ment of AXA Tower, and are in the midst of iden­ti­fy­ing a suit­able space that will meet our needs.”</p>
    <p>AXA In­sur­ance is plan­ning to exit AXA Tower, with the iconic build­ing set to be re­de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>The move comes amid t he Covid-19 pan­demic, which has pushed more com­pa­nies to re­think their use of of­fice space and work­place strat­egy.</p>
    <p>AXA – an an­chor ten­ant at the 50-storey land­mark at 8 Shen­ton Way in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District – of­fi­cially opened its of­fices in 2011.</p>
    <p>It was built in 1986 and was orig­i­nally known as the Trea­sury Build­ing be­fore it was re­named Te­masek Tower in 1997.</p>
    <p>In June this year, a Peren­nial Real Es­tate Hold­ings-led con­sor­tium sold 50 per cent of its stake to Alibaba Sin­ga­pore. The par­ent com­pany Alibaba Group is an an­chor ten­ant of the prop­erty. To­gether, they will re­de­velop AXA Tower.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Hay­ley Yap, chief peo­ple of­fi­cer of AXA In­sur­ance: “We are mak­ing plans to re­lo­cate our of­fice due to the im­pend­ing re­de­vel­op­ment of AXA Tower, and are in the midst of iden­ti­fy­ing a suit­able space that will meet our needs.”</p>
    <p>AXA oc­cu­pies five floors in AXA Tower, with a to­tal space of at least 70,000 sq ft. The build­ing has car­ried its name since 2011, and AXA de­clined to dis­close the amount it pays for the nam­ing rights.</p>
    <p>To­day, on av­er­age, only 15 per cent of the firm’s 900-strong work­force re­mains at the of­fice. This is in com­pli­ance with the need for a stag­gered re­turn to the of­fice and safe man­age­ment mea­sures for work­places, Ms Yap told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>She added that since 2017, AXA has given em­ploy­ees the op­tion to work from home, and the Covid-19 pan­demic ac­cel­er­ated the process.</p>
    <p>As more peo­ple are now com­fort­able with work­ing from home, some com­pa­nies are tak­ing the op­por­tu­nity to re­duce their of­fice space, which could lead to sig­nif­i­cant sav­ings in op­er­at­ing costs.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey com­mis­sioned by ST of nearly 1,800 peo­ple found that eight out of 10 work­ers now say they pre­fer to work from home or have flex­i­ble work­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, Sompo In­sur­ance Sin­ga­pore found in a sur­vey of its em­ploy­ees that most of them can work ef­fec­tively from home.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Pui Phu­sang­mook told ST that “with this en­cour­ag­ing re­sponse, the man­age­ment de­cided to adapt to this new nor­mal” and house ev­ery­one re­quired to be present in the of­fice at the same lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Sompo In­sur­ance, which used to oc­cupy two full floors on lev­els three and five of the Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Land Tower, re­duced 40 per cent of its of­fice space when it gave up level five. “We may have a smaller of­fice space but we man­aged to ac­com­mo­date all staff, though cur­rently only 50 per cent of them are al­lowed to work in the of­fice,” said Mr Phu­sang­mook.</p>
    <p>The com­pany found that for roles such as un­der­writer, claims re­viewer and ad­min­is­tra­tor, all func­tions can be car­ried out re­motely from home. But in other ar­eas such as cus­tomer ser­vice and IT sup­port, em­ploy­ees will be more ef­fec­tive in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Aviva is also ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of re­duc­ing its of­fice space, its spokesman told ST.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­group and Mizuho Fi­nan­cial Group in Sin­ga­pore are look­ing to cut of­fice space, Bloomberg re­ported re­cently.</p>
    <p>The lat­est mar­ket re­port showed that of­fice rent and oc­cu­pancy con­tin­ued to slide in the third quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>Real es­tate con­sult­ing firm Knight Frank has noted in its thirdquar­ter re­port that the amount of shadow space – which refers to space leased out but not ac­tu­ally used by the ten­ant – has in­creased as cor­po­rates con­tin­ued to re­view the most ef­fi­cient use of space through work­ing-from-home ro­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce and tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies con­tin­ued to lead of­fice space de­mand, while more tra­di­tional busi­nesses have been con­tribut­ing to co-work­ing space de­mand as cor­po­rates har­ness these flex­i­ble spa­ces on shorter leases to aug­ment their space re­quire­ments, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, dis­placed ten­ants of build­ings un­der­go­ing re­de­vel­op­ment, as in the case of AXA, could also gen­er­ate leas­ing de­mand.</p>
    <p>As more peo­ple are now com­fort­able with work­ing from home, some com­pa­nies are tak­ing the op­por­tu­nity to re­duce their of­fice space, which could lead to sig­nif­i­cant sav­ings in op­er­at­ing costs. A re­cent sur­vey com­mis­sioned by ST of nearly 1,800 peo­ple found that eight out of 10 work­ers now say they pre­fer to work from home or have flex­i­ble work­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
