    <p>Sin­ga­pore suf­fered its deep­est eco­nomic slump on record in the sec­ond quar­ter, prompt­ing the Gov­ern­ment to trim its growth out­look for the year and warn of more job losses. With the pan­demic still rag­ing, the road to re­cov­ery is likely to be long and rough, said Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>The National Parks Board (NParks) be­gan crush­ing $18 mil­lion worth of il­le­gal ivory, weigh­ing around nine tonnes, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It will be the largest haul de­stroyed glob­ally since 9.5 tonnes of ivory was crushed in Malaysia in 2016.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the World Wide Fund for Na­ture, wildlife traf­fick­ing is the world’s fourth-largest il­le­gal trade af­ter drugs, hu­man traf­fick­ing and coun­ter­feit­ing.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia is a hot­bed for this trade, with Sin­ga­pore serv­ing as a ma­jor tran­sit hub for il­le­gal items.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a sig­na­tory of the Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which bans in­ter­na­tional trade in ele­phant ivory.</p>
    <p>The ivory that is be­ing de­stroyed comes from var­i­ous sources and was seized over the years, in­clud­ing 8.8 tonnes – com­ing from around 300 ele­phants – that was con­fis­cated from a con­tainer which was on its way from the Demo­cratic Re­pub­lic of Congo to Viet­nam in July last year.</p>
    <p>Other sources in­clude an aban­doned check-in lug­gage bag en route to Cam­bo­dia and Laos via Sin­ga­pore in Jan­uary 2014, and ivory bracelets and bird cage ac­ces­sories car­ried by a Viet­namese trav­eller in July 2017.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sam­ples are taken for anal­y­sis, the ivory will be pul­verised by an in­dus­trial rock crusher and then in­cin­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Dr Adrian Loo, wildlife man­age­ment group di­rec­tor at NParks, said that aside from the strong mes­sage it sends, crush­ing the ivory pre­vents it from re-en­ter­ing the mar­ket and helps re­duce de­mand for it.</p>
    <p>The event also takes place in com­mem­o­ra­tion of World Ele­phant Day to­day. Those who wish to view the crush­ing process, ex­pected to take about three to five days, may visit www.go.gov.sg/npark­sivorycrus­h</p>
    <p>NParks also launched the Cen­tre for Wildlife Foren­sics yes­ter­day in an ef­fort to boost its de­tec­tion and di­ag­nos­tic ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the fight against the il­le­gal wildlife trade.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre will tap ad­vanced anal­y­sis meth­ods such as next-gen­er­a­tion se­quenc­ing, mass spec­trom­e­try and iso­tope anal­y­sis to ex­am­ine spec­i­men DNA even in heav­ily pro­cessed sam­ples.</p>
    <p>Dr Loo said such meth­ods com­ple­ment data­bases al­ready used by in­ter­na­tional ex­perts and en­force­ment agen­cies and will al­low Sin­ga­pore to con­trib­ute to the global fight against wildlife traf­fick­ing.</p>
    <p>“The data that we get en­ables in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions and source coun­tries to in­ves­ti­gate and en­force bet­ter. It also helps to iden­tify po­ten­tial links such as syn­di­cates that are op­er­at­ing in (these) coun­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre will fo­cus its ef­forts on wildlife most se­verely im­pacted by the il­le­gal wildlife trade, such as ele­phants, rhinoceros­es, pan­golins, sharks and rays, and song­birds.</p>
    <p>It will also tackle il­le­gal tim­ber trade through the es­tab­lish­ment of the Sin­ga­pore Xy­lar­ium – a col­lec­tion of au­then­ti­cated tim­ber spec­i­mens which will en­able re­searchers to com­pare and iden­tify their unique char­ac­ter­is­tics and ge­net­ics. This will en­able Sin­ga­pore to in­ves­ti­gate and pros­e­cute those who trade in il­le­gal tim­ber more ef­fi­ciently.</p>
    <p>National De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee, who was at the launch of the cen­tre, said: “The il­le­gal trade in wildlife threat­ens the sur­vival of en­dan­gered species, de­stroys habi­tats and dis­rupts ecosys­tems around the world. Sin­ga­pore adopts a zero-tol­er­ance stance on the il­le­gal trade in wildlife... All of us can also do our part to help pro­tect ele­phants and other en­dan­gered species by not buy­ing il­le­gal wildlife prod­ucts, and also dis­cour­ag­ing oth­ers from do­ing so.”</p>
