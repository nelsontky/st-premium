    <p>With her doe eyes and flaw­less skin, you would think South Korean ac­tress-singer Uee (pro­nounced “you-ee”) is used to get­ting com­pli­ments about her looks.</p>
    <p>But when the 32-year-old was cast to play a char­ac­ter who turns into a beauty through plas­tic surgery, she felt flat­tered.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail in­ter­view, she told The Straits Times: “I am re­ally ap­pre­cia­tive that the di­rec­tor (Oh Ki-hwan) thought I was such a beauty.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, whose real name is Kim Yu-jin, stars in one of the episodes of the on­go­ing South Korean sci-fi an­thol­ogy se­ries SF8. The show deals with top­ics such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, aug­mented re­al­ity, vir­tual re­al­ity, ro­bots and gam­ing.</p>
    <p>In the episode, which pre­mieres on Oh!K (StarHub TV Chan­nel 816 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 525) on Satur­day, her char­ac­ter Han Ji-won dates a man through a vir­tu­al­re­al­ity app called Love Vir­tu­ally. He is played by Choi Si-won, a mem­ber of K-pop boy band Su­per Ju­nior.</p>
    <p>Both char­ac­ters have un­der­gone plas­tic surgery, but use their “orig­i­nal” faces on the app, mak­ing them hes­i­tant to meet in real life.</p>
    <p>Here are four things you should know about Uee, a former mem­ber of K-pop girl group Af­ter School who has also acted in the dra­mas Mar­riage Con­tract (2016) and Man­hole (2017).</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>UEE HAS KNOWN CHOI SI-WON FOR A VERY LONG TIME</p>
    <p>It is not known ex­actly how long, but both stars have said they have been fa­mil­iar with each other “for a long time”.</p>
    <p>Uee told ST that she was able to feel less ner­vous and fo­cus bet­ter be­cause Choi, 34, kept talk­ing to her be­tween shoots, which put her at ease. “We re­hearsed the scenes to­gether and he helped a lot,” she said.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>SHE DANCES BY HER­SELF ON THE SET A LOT</p>
    <p>The ac­tress’ im­promptu per­for­mances of­ten made her co-stars feel em­bar­rassed.</p>
    <p>While Uee did not ex­plain her be­hav­iour, she said Choi would dance along with her, which made the film­ing ex­pe­ri­ence more en­joy­able.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>SHE HAS NEVER USED A DAT­ING APP</p>
    <p>While her char­ac­ter is wrapped up in on­line dat­ing, Uee does not have any real-life ex­pe­ri­ence with dat­ing apps.</p>
    <p>The abil­ity to tran­scend space to ex­pe­ri­ence some­thing new makes vir­tual-re­al­ity apps at­trac­tive, she noted, but she prefers “the real thing”.</p>
    <p>“What I can see, hear and feel are more im­por­tant,” she said.</p>
    <p>“So I think I will try (us­ing a dat­ing app) once or twice out of cu­rios­ity, but I am not sure if I will con­tinue us­ing it.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>HON­ESTY IS IM­POR­TANT TO HER</p>
    <p>In the episode, her char­ac­ter lies about her looks, which Uee ac­knowl­edged is pos­si­ble in vir­tual re­al­ity if the par­ties have been hid­ing the truth from each other right from the be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, it is im­por­tant to re­alise that you will be truly happy only through the process of find­ing the truth,” she said.</p>
    <p>The SF8 episode ti­tled Love Vir­tu­ally pre­mieres at 8pm on Satur­day on Oh!K (StarHub TV Chan­nel 816 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 525).</p>
