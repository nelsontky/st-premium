    <p>My jour­ney to Sin­ga­pore’s first ma­rine park is off to a driz­zly start. Con­sult­ing the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s tide tim­ings on the eve of my visit last weekend, it oc­curs to me I might have picked the wrong time of the lu­nar month to make this trip.</p>
    <p>It is neap tide, where the dif­fer­ence be­tween high and low tides is smallest. This means the wa­ters do not re­cede as far back as they do dur­ing the spring tide, which oc­curs at full moon and new moon.</p>
    <p>My sus­pi­cions are con­firmed when I speak to na­ture en­thu­si­ast Carol Phillips while wait­ing for my Ma­rina South Fer­ries boat to Big Sis­ter’s Is­land. Of the two Sis­ters’ Is­lands, this is the only one open to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“In the re­ally low spring tides, you can walk out into the la­goon and see the corals ex­posed,” says the 55-yearold, who has also spot­ted fluted clams in the in­ter­tidal zone of the big la­goon.</p>
    <p>“To­day, if you are lucky, you’ll see fish mov­ing about – you might need to put your head un­der­wa­ter. You might want to walk on the rocky break­wa­ter and look down to see if you can see any­thing swim­ming around. If the water is clear, you might spot anemone and the corals with their ten­ta­cles out feed­ing.”</p>
    <p>I don’t see any fish when I’m there (then again, I didn’t stick my head un­der­wa­ter), but am in­trigued when na­ture and water sports en­thu­si­ast Adrian Chia, 41, who snorkels in the la­goon, tells me about a black­tip reef shark that once brushed against his leg when he was swim­ming in the shal­lows.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing around the is­land, I en­counter sev­eral signs ad­vis­ing cau­tion. One warns vis­i­tors about box jel­ly­fish, which have re­cently been sighted in Sin­ga­pore wa­ters (off the beaches of Sen­tosa and Lazarus Is­land, for in­stance).</p>
    <p>Get­ting stung by them is no joke – their stings are highly venomous and po­ten­tially fa­tal. Vic­tims, reel­ing from the pain or paral­y­sis, are also in dan­ger of drown­ing.</p>
    <p>I’m in no mood to swim to­day, so I (re­luc­tantly) get ac­quainted with the is­land’s land res­i­dents – a troop of wild mon­keys. Other is­land-hop­pers had warned me about these ag­gres­sive fel­lows, which are known to stand at the pier in wait of pas­sen­gers and prey on unat­tended back­packs, rip­ping or un­zip­ping them.</p>
    <p>The al­pha male gives me the evil eye be­fore half-chas­ing me down the beach. Mr Chia finds me a wooden pole. “We’ll fight them on the beaches”, I think grimly, feel­ing their eyes on my back as I walk down the shore.</p>
    <p>The mon­keys even­tu­ally leave me alone and I spend the rest of my time watch­ing her­mit crabs on the beach.</p>
    <p>I think of T. S. Eliot’s The Love Song Of J. Al­fred Prufrock: “I should have been a pair of ragged claws/ Scut­tling across the floors of silent seas.”</p>
    <p>The la­goon wa­ters are cool and invit­ing and I could linger here all day, pol­ish­ing idle thoughts against the mu­sic of waves on the seashells.</p>
    <p>But the tide is ris­ing and I have other horizons to pur­sue.</p>
