    <p>In the heady days of in­ter­na­tional travel, I used to scour blogs and guide­books for new ways to un­cover well­known cities, de­light­ing in un­der­the-radar neigh­bour­hoods where lo­cal busi­nesses thrive.</p>
    <p>A food truck in London’s Brix­ton dis­trict gave me my first taste of Ja­maican food; Wil­liams­burg in Brook­lyn, New York, has some of the best thrift stores I have seen any­where in the world.</p>
    <p>Blair Plain, an area com­pris­ing Ever­ton Park, Spot­tis­woode Park and Kam­pong Bahru Road, is cen­tral Sin­ga­pore’s ver­sion of that.</p>
    <p>It is an up-and-com­ing neigh­bour­hood where laun­dro­mats and beauty sa­lons share a five-foot-way with ar­ti­sanal cof­fee joints, a mix of old and new that feels cool with­out be­ing en­tirely ceded to the hip­sters.</p>
    <p>“It’s like Tiong Bahru 15 years ago,” says tour guide Toh Thiam Wei. The 39-year-old is also the founder of tour com­pany In­die Sin­ga­pore, which yes­ter­day launched the Won­der Wan­der Blair Plain tour as part of its Tales From Our Back­yard se­ries.</p>
    <p>Vis­it­ing Blair Plain on one’s own is a per­fectly good ex­pe­ri­ence, but go­ing on Mr Toh’s tour feels like hang­ing out with an in-the-know friend who knows all the colour­ful anec­dotes.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, he re­veals that a steep stretch of Can­ton­ment Road, which l eads from Ou­tram MRT sta­tion to Ever­ton Park, was used in the 1960s and 1970s as part of the driv­ing test route.</p>
    <p>It earned the moniker of “im­me­di­ate fail­ure slope” be­cause so many rolled back­wards on it while try­ing to move off from a sta­tion­ary po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>And when we visit the shops in Ever­ton Park, own­ers such as Mr Alan Yoon, 47, who runs soya bean fam­ily business Beano, greet Mr Toh heartily and wel­come us be­hind the counter to check out the pro­duc­tion process.</p>
    <p>Set up in 2004, Beano is one of the neigh­bour­hood’s stal­warts, along with Ji Xiang Con­fec­tionery, whose ang ku kueh or red tor­toise shell-shaped cakes are made by hand and at­tract long queues.</p>
    <p>Then there are the newer play­ers – plucky en­trepreneur­s at­tracted by the lower rent com­pared to ar­eas such as Tiong Bahru or Haji Lane.</p>
    <p>It is a chal­leng­ing yet vi­brant land­scape, one that Mr Jonathan Ng, co-founder of bak­ery cafe The Bet­ter Half, has em­braced. He launched the brand on­line in 2018 with his girl­friend and opened the cosy space last year.</p>
    <p>He says: “We’ve at­tracted a reg­u­lar crowd and even the el­derly peo­ple liv­ing up­stairs know us. There is a sense of com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Snacks and drinks from all th­ese stops are in­cluded in the price of the tour, along with a flo­ral vin­tagestyle tif­fin car­rier that is handy for stor­ing the treats.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing down a row of con­ser­va­tion shop­houses, we duck into the air-con­di­tioned com­fort of Art Porters Gallery, which spe­cialises in South-east Asian con­tem­po­rary art, with a spot­light on young artists.</p>
    <p>Ex­hi­bi­tions change ev­ery two months and the gallery cur­rently fea­tures a graf­fiti artist from Thai­land who goes by Alex Face. His paint­ings, said to ex­plore themes of youth, age­ing and spir­i­tu­al­ity, feature a girl in a bunny suit that is in­spired by his daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Just when we are done brows­ing, gallery co-founder Guil­laume LevyLam­bert, 58, swings open a mir­rored panel to re­veal a sec­ond ex­hi­bi­tion space. Step­ping through the door­way, com­plete with a let­tered neon sign over­head, feels like en­ter­ing a se­cret bar.</p>
    <p>The mood is light and the vibe un­pre­ten­tious, so I ven­ture a ques­tion I have al­ways had about mod­ern art.</p>
    <p>“Why do peo­ple con­sider this art when it ap­pears so sim­ple?” I ask, ges­tur­ing at an om­bre paint­ing of light blue, white and grey. To my un­trained eye, it looks like a Mi­crosoft Word colour swatch.</p>
    <p>I worry that my ig­no­rance might of­fend, but Mr Levy-Lam­bert is ge­nial – point­ing out the tech­ni­cal mas­tery re­quired to ex­e­cute the seam­less gra­di­ent and colours cho­sen for their sooth­ing tones.</p>
    <p>In fact, the paint­ing had just been sold for $1,900 to a cus­tomer look­ing to hang it in her bed­room.</p>
    <p>In an in­con­gru­ous but de­light­fully Sin­ga­porean twist, the gallery also sells frozen otah un­der the brand Otah Boy, cre­ated by gallery co-founder Sean Soh, 40.</p>
    <p>“When cus­tomers come to pick up their or­der, they of­ten think they are in the wrong place,” says Mr Levy-Lam­bert with a chor­tle.</p>
    <p>It is just one more sur­prise on a tour filled with many, tucked in yet an­other nook of the is­land wait­ing to be seen anew.</p>
    <p>The tour of Blair Plain will take you past sights such as this mu­ral by graf­fiti artist Alex Face.</p>
