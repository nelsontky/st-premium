    <p>Be­hind the fresh and frozen seafood supplied by food man­u­fac­tur­ers lies the labour of many work­ers tak­ing on the ar­du­ous task of fil­let­ing fish by hand.</p>
    <p>But seafood sup­plier Hai Sia Seafood has moved past such man­ual labour by in­vest­ing in a fish fil­let­ing ma­chine that has en­abled it to weather the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has kept man­power on site to a min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>The ma­chine re­duces re­liance on in­ten­sive l abour, while help­ing staff im­prove their skills. In­stead of fil­let­ing fish by hand, work­ers learn to op­er­ate the equip­ment, track yields and fo­cus on qual­ity con­trol.</p>
    <p>It has also in­creased the ca­pac­ity of this process five­fold, said deputy di­rec­tor Ang Junt­ing, adding: “Since 2015, there has been on­go­ing trans­for­ma­tion within the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“Be­yond the au­to­ma­tion of the pro­cess­ing plant, we have been dig­i­tal­is­ing our busi­ness through the im­ple­men­ta­tion of an en­ter­prise re­source plan­ning sys­tem and ware­house man­age­ment sys­tem. The buy-in from stake­hold­ers of the com­pany has been strong and the re­sults from the pro­duc­tiv­ity gains have been re­ward­ing.”</p>
    <p>The firm also has a ther­mo­form vac­uum pack­ager that re­places the mun­dane task of plac­ing prod­ucts into vac­uum pouches and align­ing them with a typ­i­cal ma­chine.</p>
    <p>The new equip­ment makes the process faster, en­sur­ing seafood can reach the cold room more quickly. The ex­te­rior of the pack­ag­ing also re­mains clean.</p>
    <p>These in­no­va­tions have helped the com­pany in­crease pro­duc­tion dur­ing the pan­demic de­spite hav­ing to split into dif­fer­ent teams and shifts.</p>
    <p>“We could change our pro­duc­tion line from pro­duc­ing bulk packs for air­line cater­ers and food ser­vices to small re­tail packs for on­line gro­cers and su­per­mar­kets,” said Mr Ang.</p>
    <p>“This flex­i­bil­ity is, in part, made pos­si­ble by elim­i­na­tion of choke points such as fil­let­ing and pack­ag­ing, which we have au­to­mated.”</p>
