    <p>1 How were the in­dica­tive achieve­ment level (AL) cut-off points for school types de­rived?</p>
    <p>The in­for­ma­tion was de­rived from the 2019 Pri­mary 6 co­hort’s Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion (PSLE) re­sults and school choices.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) first sim­u­lated each pupil’s in­di­vid­ual sub­ject score in AL terms, based on their raw sub­ject scores. The AL scores were added to form a pupil’s to­tal PSLE score. It then sim­u­lated their post­ing out­comes based on the new Sec­ondary 1 post­ing sys­tem and its tie-break­ers.</p>
    <p>The in­dica­tive AL cut-off point for each school was de­ter­mined by the PSLE score of the last stu­dent ad­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Based on the score of the last stu­dent ad­mit­ted, the low­est and the high­est cut-off points of schools within each school type were used to ob­tain the range.</p>
    <p>The ac­tual cut-off point for a school can vary yearly, as this de­pends on PSLE re­sults and school choice pat­terns of each Pri­mary 6 co­hort.</p>
    <p>2 Why is MOE re­leas­ing in­dica­tive AL cut-off point ranges by school types now, and do­ing so for in­di­vid­ual sec­ondary schools only next year?</p>
    <p>The first batch of pupils un­der the new sys­tem will soon re­ceive their Pri­mary 5 end-ofyear ex­am­i­na­tion re­sults in the AL for­mat.</p>
    <p>MOE said that re­leas­ing in­dica­tive cut-off point ranges by school types would pro­vide pupils some con­text to where they might stand.</p>
    <p>The in­dica­tive AL cut-off points for each sec­ondary school will be re­leased in the first half of next year. These will be based on data from this year’s PSLE co­hort, which would be most re­cent.</p>
    <p>3 Will sev­eral schools have the same AL cut-off points? How do par­ents make school choices when the in­dica­tive AL cut-off points for many schools are the same?</p>
    <p>The AL bands, on the whole, have been de­lib­er­ately de­signed to be wider, there­fore more schools will likely have the same AL cut-off.</p>
    <p>Par­ents and stu­dents are en­cour­aged to look be­yond the schools’ cut-off points when choos­ing a sec­ondary school, MOE said. They should con­sider the stu­dent’s learn­ing needs, in­ter­ests, strengths and as­pi­ra­tions, along with the school’s cul­ture, en­vi­ron­ment, ethos and pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>MOE added that par­ents and stu­dents should bear in mind that or­der of choice of schools will be a tie-breaker from next year on­wards.</p>
