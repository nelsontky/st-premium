    <p>There were 94 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,666.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded four com­mu­nity cases who are all Sin­ga­pore­ans, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>Only one of the com­mu­nity cases is un­linked – a 25-year-old woman who started show­ing symp­toms on Aug 22.</p>
    <p>She was con­firmed to have the coro­n­avirus on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>There were also 10 im­ported cases among the new pa­tients, com­pris­ing three Sin­ga­pore­ans, four per­ma­nent res­i­dents, one de­pen­dant’s pass holder, one long-term visit pass holder and one short-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>Among the i mported cases was an 88-year-old Sin­ga­porean man and a six-year-old girl who is a de­pen­dant’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>Both had re­turned from In­dia, and they were con­firmed pos­i­tive on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Among the 80 cases re­sid­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, 58 are from Sungei Ten­gah Lodge and had been quar­an­tined ear­lier.</p>
    <p>MOH said most of them were tested dur­ing quar­an­tine to de­ter­mine their sta­tus, or were picked up through ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>A coro­n­avirus clus­ter at Sungei Ten­gah Lodge was an­nounced on Aug 22.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the clus­ter was de­tected, MOH quar­an­tined about 4,500 work­ers and has tested about 3,000 of them so far.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that it ex­pects the num­ber of cases from the dor­mi­tory to con­tinue to be high in the com­ing days un­til test­ing of the re­main­ing quar­an­tined work­ers is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has re­mained sta­ble, at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble, at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 198 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 55,322 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 71 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal while 1,231 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care. Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
