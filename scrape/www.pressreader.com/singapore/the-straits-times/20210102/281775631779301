    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s stance against declar­ing another state of emer­gency ap­pears to be shift­ing, as Covid-19 in­fec­tions fu­elled by the on­set of cold weather showed no signs of abat­ing even af­ter the coun­try stepped up con­tain­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Tokyo’s met­ro­pol­i­tan govern­ment is con­sid­er­ing a re­quest to the cen­tral govern­ment to de­clare a state of emer­gency, na­tional broad­caster NHK has re­ported, with­out cit­ing how it ob­tained the in­for­ma­tion. On Wed­nes­day, Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, who is in charge of Ja­pan’s Covid-19 re­sponse, said the coun­try could con­sider an emer­gency if in­fec­tions con­tinue at the cur­rent rate.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese of­fi­cials have un­til now said they were not think­ing about tak­ing such a step.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, who typ­i­cally says an emer­gency is not be­ing con­sid­ered, brushed past di­rect ques­tions about it on Thurs­day in re­marks to re­porters. Mr Suga said the most im­por­tant thing is pro­tect­ing the med­i­cal sys­tem and pre­vent­ing ac­cel­er­at­ing virus spread. He did not ad­dress the emer­gency di­rectly.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan briefly en­acted a state of emer­gency dur­ing April and May last year in re­sponse to the ini­tial wave of Covid-19 cases. The state of emer­gency does not en­able a full lock­down, but gives more pow­ers to lo­cal gov­ern­ments, in­clud­ing to urge res­i­dents to stay at home for a cer­tain span of time dur­ing the emer­gency pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The news comes as Ja­pan re­ported a record day of new Covid-19 cases on Thurs­day, cross­ing 4,000 for the first time. Tokyo saw a record 1,337 cases – a large jump and the first time the daily fig­ure has topped 1,000.</p>
    <p>Some ur­ban ar­eas across Ja­pan have al­ready im­ple­mented mea­sures, such as re­quest­ing bars and restau­rants to close early. The govern­ment has also moved for­ward with a de­ci­sion to ap­ply to change the law so that it could fine restau­rants that fail to heed re­quests to close early, Sankei re­ported yes­ter­day, cit­ing govern­ment sources fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter. The amended mea­sures will be sub­mit­ted for ap­proval when the Diet is back in ses­sion this month.</p>
    <p>While the ab­so­lute in­fec­tion numbers are low in Ja­pan com­pared with coun­tries such as the United States and In­dia, it has been grap­pling with a surge that be­gan in early Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment lacks the le­gal means to com­pel a lock­down, and its abil­ity to con­tain the virus’ spread with­out one is now com­ing un­der ques­tion. Also, of­fi­cials have been avoid­ing the im­po­si­tion of heavy re­stric­tions as they try to get the coun­try’s re­ces­sion­ary econ­omy back on track.</p>
