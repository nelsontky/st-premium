    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Santa Claus can safely de­liver gifts to good girls and boys on Christ­mas, af­ter a spe­cial vis­i­tor went all the way to the North Pole to de­liver a coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, the top in­fec­tious disease of­fi­cial in the US, said on Satur­day that he per­son­ally gave Old St Nick his jab.</p>
    <p>“I took care of that for you be­cause I was wor­ried that you’d all be up­set,” he said dur­ing a CNN and Se­same Street coro­n­avirus town-hall event for fam­i­lies, af­ter wor­ried young­sters asked whether Santa could safely en­ter homes on Dec 25.</p>
    <p>“I took a trip up there to the North Pole; I went there and I vac­ci­nated Santa Claus my­self. I mea­sured his level of im­mu­nity, and he is good to go,” Dr Fauci de­clared.</p>
    <p>“He can come down the chim­ney, he can leave the presents... you have noth­ing to worry about.”</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci’s good news comes as coun­tries around the world are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a surge in Covid-19 cases, with mil­lions in Eng­land and Italy pre­par­ing to cel­e­brate the hol­i­day un­der tough “stay at home” or­ders.</p>
    <p>The United States, the coun­try that has seen the most deaths linked to Covid-19, launched a mass vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign this week.</p>
    <p>I took a trip up there to the North Pole; I went there and I vac­ci­nated Santa Claus my­self. I mea­sured his level of im­mu­nity, and he is good to go.</p>
    <p>DR AN­THONY FAUCI, the top in­fec­tious disease of­fi­cial in the US.</p>
