    <p>PARIS • The man­ager of Bora-Hans­grohe has raised con­cerns about Covid-19 test­ing ahead of the Tour de France af­ter pulling his team out of the Bre­tagne Clas­sic on Tues­day be­cause of a false pos­i­tive re­sult.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man cy­cling team with­drew all of their rid­ers from the race af­ter one team mem­ber was no­ti­fied of a pos­i­tive test be­fore Tues­day’s Bre­tagne stage.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in a later state­ment, the team said the rider had been tested again and the re­sult had been neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>“It looks like my con­cerns are be­ing con­firmed,” team boss Ralph Denk said. “It is known that PCR tests have a cer­tain rate of er­ror and thus pro­duce false pos­i­tive re­sults.</p>
    <p>“This in it­self would not be a prob­lem, if there were the pos­si­bil­ity to check the re­sults im­me­di­ately in the case of a pos­i­tive find­ing.”</p>
    <p>When rid­ers are tested for dop­ing, an A and B sam­ple are used, and Denk be­lieves a sim­i­lar sys­tem should be used to make sure Covid-19 tests are ac­cu­rate, par­tic­u­larly when the stakes are so high.</p>
    <p>Two pos­i­tive tests at the Tour will mean a team would be with­drawn from the blue-riband race.</p>
    <p>“(In anti-dop­ing tests) an A sam­ple and a B sam­ple are pro­vided, pre­cisely for this rea­son. If the A sam­ple is pos­i­tive, the re­sult is checked with the B sam­ple,” said Denk, whose team are the first to pull out of a World Tour race af­ter a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>“In the UCI’s cur­rent test­ing strat­egy, this ver­i­fi­ca­tion is not present. We are talk­ing about ath­letes who have pre­pared for a race for weeks or months and then might not be al­lowed to start the event due to a false find­ing.”</p>
    <p>With the Tour set to start in Nice on Satur­day, Denk has called on im­me­di­ate ad­just­ments to the test­ing pro­to­cols. He said: “We also re­quire cer­tainty re­gard­ing test­ing pro­ce­dures and strat­egy. If we don’t have this, we will soon have se­ri­ous is­sues, be­cause who wants to in­vest in a lottery game as a se­ri­ous com­pany?”</p>
    <p>Cy­cling’s gov­ern­ing body, the UCI, has yet to com­ment on Denk’s con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Rid­ers and team staff at the Tour will be in a “bub­ble” from the day they ar­rive in Nice. They will be tested for Covid-19 twice be­fore the race starts and a mo­bile test­ing lab will be at their dis­posal.</p>
    <p>France has seen a surge in coro­n­avirus cases re­cently, al­though the num­ber of peo­ple in in­ten­sive care has re­mained sta­ble.</p>
