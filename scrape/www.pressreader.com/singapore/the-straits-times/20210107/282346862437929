    <p>ABU DHABI • De­fend­ing Aus­tralian Open cham­pion Sofia Kenin be­lieves the tough bio-se­cure mea­sures im­posed on play­ers at the start of the 2021 sea­son are “harsh” but says she is still “happy to be trav­el­ling”.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can world No. 4, top seed at the sea­son-open­ing WTA event in Abu Dhabi which started yes­ter­day and runs till next Wed­nes­day, will be kept in a bub­ble along with her fel­low com­peti­tors be­fore they all move to Mel­bourne for the de­layed Aus­tralian</p>
    <p>Open due to start on Feb 8.</p>
    <p>Upon ar­riv­ing in Aus­tralia, they will first be quar­an­tined for two weeks, when they will be al­lowed to leave their ho­tel rooms for only five hours a day to train at Mel­bourne Park.</p>
    <p>For the first week, play­ers must pair up and stick to the same prac­tice part­ner, be­fore adding two more to their prac­tice group in the sec­ond week of quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>“It’s not the most ideal sit­u­a­tion,” Kenin said at an on­line press con­fer­ence on Tues­day. “I wish we could go out and walk around the city but we can’t. It is what it is.</p>
    <p>“I’m just happy to be here, I’m happy to be trav­el­ling, I’m try­ing to keep it as nor­mal as pos­si­ble. The rules are quite harsh, but it’s for ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Kenin is grate­ful for the ad­di­tional time she has been able to spend on court to pre­pare for this sea­son and is happy there will at least be some fans – 20 per cent ca­pac­ity – al­lowed to at­tend the open­ing Grand Slam of the year.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, how­ever, are less happy with the re­stric­tions placed on the play­ers.</p>
    <p>“I’m hop­ing that this bub­ble life will end very soon,” said Tu­nisian Ons Jabeur, who is seeded 15th in</p>
    <p>Abu Dhabi and reached the quar­ter-fi­nals at last year’s Aus­tralian Open. “I’m not sure when Covid is go­ing to be over but we want our free­dom.</p>
    <p>“We don’t need this kind of re­stric­tion, but what can you do? You have to ac­cept them af­ter all.”</p>
    <p>With tour­na­ment bub­bles set to be part of the pro cir­cuit for the fore­see­able fu­ture amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the sit­u­a­tion has also forced play­ers to make dras­tic changes to the way they ap­proach matches.</p>
    <p>Ukrainian world No. 5 Elina Svi­tolina has re­sponded to the stress and un­cer­tainty by hir­ing a men­tal coach.</p>
    <p>“I think dur­ing the dif­fi­cult time right now, men­tally it’s very im­por­tant to stay strong, to stay fresh,” she said. “And also play­ing with­out the peo­ple, the fans, it’s a dif­fer­ent at­mos­phere... it’s very im­por­tant to stay fo­cused and be ready for any­thing that comes my way.”</p>
    <p>A last-minute de­ci­sion was made to stage a WTA Tour 500 women’s ten­nis tour­na­ment in Abu Dhabi in or­der to give play­ers an op­por­tu­nity to com­pete be­fore they hop on char­tered flights to Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Play­ers have been given ex­emp­tions from the emi­rate’s manda­tory 10-day quar­an­tine but must ad­here to strict rules lim­it­ing their move­ment to just the ho­tel and the Zayed Sports City tour­na­ment site. The one-off event has no spon­sors and the WTA is pro­vid­ing the US$565,530 (S$744,000) prize pot.</p>
    <p>In yes­ter­day’s first-round, Rus­sia’s Veronika Ku­d­er­me­tova upset Es­to­nian 10th seed Anett Kon­taveit 7-5, 6-1, while ninth seed Maria Sakkari of Greece ad­vanced af­ter beat­ing Russian Anas­ta­sia Po­tapova 6-4, 6-2.</p>
