    <p>•</p>
    <p>Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics flagged earn­ings that beat an­a­lyst es­ti­mates af­ter the South Korean tech gi­ant’s mo­bile and chip busi­nesses ben­e­fited from US re­stric­tions on Huawei Tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>The world’s largest man­u­fac­turer of mem­ory chips and per­sonal elec­tron­ics said yes­ter­day that its thirdquar­ter op­er­at­ing profit likely jumped 58 per cent. A re­cov­ery in smart­phone sales and a rush or­der of chips from Huawei off­set the ef­fects of weak mem­ory chip prices.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing in­come was likely 12.3 tril­lion won (S$14.5 bil­lion) in the three months ended Septem­ber, beat­ing the 10 tril­lion won av­er­age of es­ti­mates. It would be the high­est since the 17.57 tril­lion won of the third quar­ter of 2018.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung did not pro­vide net in­come or break down divi­sional per­for­mance, which it will report later this month when it re­leases its fi­nal re­sults. It re­leased only lim­ited data in the reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the quar­ter likely rose 6 per cent from the same pe­riod a year ear­lier to 66 tril­lion won, said the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“It seems Huawei’s im­pact on Sam­sung’s chip business was big­ger than the mar­ket ex­pected, and there was a big sur­prise in the smart­phone and home ap­pli­ance busi­nesses,” said head of re­search C. W. Chung at No­mura in South Korea.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung’s share price rose 1.2 per cent in morn­ing trade, out­per­form­ing the bench­mark Kospi’s 0.7 per cent rise.</p>
    <p>The firm’s smart­phone ship­ments jumped to about 80 mil­lion hand­sets from 54.2 mil­lion in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter af­ter de­mand re­bounded from a con­trac­tion brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic in the first half of this year, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>While weaker mem­ory prices pres­sured Sam­sung’s over­all chip business, said an­a­lysts, ship­ments had a boost from or­ders for graphic chips for games con­soles and or­ders for mo­bile chips, in­clud­ing from Huawei.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese smart­phone maker had been build­ing stock­piles be­fore US re­stric­tions from the mid­dle of last month pre­vented it from buy­ing chips made us­ing US tech­nol­ogy with­out a sources said.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung’s home ap­pli­ance business also likely re­ceived a lift from li­cence, in­dus­try the pan­demic, which spurred con­sumers to spend more on prod­ucts that make their homes cleaner, an­a­lysts said.</p>
