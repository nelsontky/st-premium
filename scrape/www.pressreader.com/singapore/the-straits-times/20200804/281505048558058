    <p>Com­pa­nies that catered mostly to tourists be­fore Covid-19 are beef­ing up dig­i­tal of­fer­ings and re­de­ploy­ing re­sources amid pro­longed travel re­stric­tions due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, travel firm Nam Ho Group is plan­ning to launch vir­tual tours of travel des­ti­na­tions as well as an on­line store sell­ing pop­u­lar over­seas snacks and pro­duce.</p>
    <p>And, given the uptick in on­line shop­ping, it has also sec­onded 16 of its pas­sen­ger vans to pro­vide home de­liv­ery ser­vices. Its ve­hi­cles are help­ing to de­liver or­ders made through e-com­merce sites Lazada and Shopee.</p>
    <p>Tintin Sin­ga­pore, which sells comic-re­lated mem­o­ra­bilia, is clos­ing its Chi­na­town store at the end of this month af­ter ne­go­ti­a­tions with its land­lord fell through.</p>
    <p>It has been spend­ing more on dig­i­tal ad­ver­tis­ing to at­tract lo­cal sales at its e-store and phys­i­cal shop.</p>
    <p>It is hunt­ing for a new lo­ca­tion, but, in the mean­time, the shop is of­fer­ing dis­counts of 30 per cent and free de­liv­ery within Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“At this mo­ment, the mode is plain sur­vival,” a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>With the dis­count, the com­pany hopes to “gen­er­ate enough cash flow to make sure our team’s salary will not be af­fected much”.</p>
    <p>Re­sults so far “have up­lifted us a bit but, in the longer run, a bet­ter frame­work is needed to en­sure our ex­is­tence”, he added.</p>
    <p>Tourists, mostly from In­done­sia, Aus­tralia, Hong Kong, In­dia and the United States, made up 85 per cent of the shop’s cus­tomers be­fore Covid-19 hit. “We suf­fered huge losses,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Chi­na­town Her­itage Cen­tre launched its e-shop on June 29 af­ter its team at­tended a United Over­seas Bank work­shop ad­vis­ing small and medium-sized en­ter­prises on how to go on­line.</p>
    <p>Its di­rec­tor Mar­garet Zhang said: “By cre­at­ing the e-shop and go­ing on­line, more peo­ple will have ac­cess to our mer­chan­dise, in­clud­ing those who have not vis­ited or those who are un­able to visit our shop­house mu­seum, as we are tem­po­rar­ily closed dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>The cen­tre used to get 70 per cent</p>
    <p>IM­PROV­ING REACH ON­LINE</p>
    <p>By cre­at­ing the e-shop and go­ing on­line, more peo­ple will have ac­cess to our mer­chan­dise, in­clud­ing those who have not vis­ited or those who are un­able to visit our shop­house mu­seum, as we are tem­po­rar­ily closed dur­ing ’’ this Covid-19 pe­riod.</p>
    <p>MS MAR­GARET ZHANG, di­rec­tor of the Chi­na­town Her­itage Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>of its rev­enue from tourists and the other 30 per cent from lo­cal stu­dent tours. It is pro­gres­sively up­load­ing all its mer­chan­dise to its e-shop, which will be a per­ma­nent of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Zhang is en­cour­aged by the lo­cal and over­seas sales or­ders so far.</p>
    <p>“We hope that the e-store will gen­er­ate a new rev­enue stream for (the cen­tre) in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Nam Ho di­rec­tor Mar­shall Ooi said the firm is “in the fi­nal stages of rolling out its vir­tual tour (which) al­lows in­di­vid­u­als to ex­plore new travel des­ti­na­tions from the com­fort of their homes”.</p>
    <p>Its pre-Covid-19 an­nual rev­enue for Sin­ga­pore was more than $55 mil­lion, split about evenly be­tween in­bound and out­bound travel.</p>
    <p>“Nam Ho’s busi­ness in Sin­ga­pore was grow­ing in the be­gin­ning of the year un­til the news on Covid-19 broke out,” Mr Ooi said, adding that rev­enue has since de­clined sharply and nearly been wiped out.</p>
    <p>With the eas­ing of in­ter­na­tional trade curbs, the firm has re­cently started work­ing with over­seas fac­to­ries and sup­pli­ers to im­port their pro­duce, which it plans to sell on­line.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce, lo­gis­tics and ware­hous­ing will be­come Nam Ho’s per­ma­nent busi­ness lines, Mr Ooi said.</p>
    <p>He added: “The aim is to con­tinue to ex­cite cus­tomers by giv­ing them op­por­tu­ni­ties to lit­er­ally have a taste of renowned lo­cal food fare, even if they are un­able to visit the coun­try at the mo­ment.”</p>
