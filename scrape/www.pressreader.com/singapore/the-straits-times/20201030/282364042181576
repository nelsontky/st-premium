    <p>In a bid to se­cure busi­ness con­tracts in­volv­ing projects with gov­ern­ment agen­cies, a com­pany di­rec­tor paid over $30,000 in bribes.</p>
    <p>Ngiam Chee Chong, 45, was jailed for 12 weeks yes­ter­day, hav­ing pleaded guilty to seven cor­rup­tion-re­lated charges ear­lier.</p>
    <p>An­other 13 sim­i­lar charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by the court dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Ngiam was the sole di­rec­tor of Emer­sion IT Ser­vices, which is in the busi­ness of set­ting up and im­ple­ment­ing net­work ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2016 and 2018, he paid a to­tal of $37,400 to Teo Joo Tye, 52, who was then a se­nior tech­ni­cal ser­vices man­ager with IT firm NCS.</p>
    <p>He did so to re­ward Teo for rec­om­mend­ing Emer­sion as a sub­con­trac­tor of NCS for 13 projects, which in­volved gov­ern­ment agen­cies such as Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms. These projects were sub­se­quently awarded to Emer­sion.</p>
    <p>Teo was in a po­si­tion where his rec­om­men­da­tions car­ried weight.</p>
    <p>Ngiam had also agreed to pay Teo a to­tal of $9,300 for six other projects, for which Emer­sion was rec­om­mended and later awarded.</p>
    <p>But he did not pay those bribes in the end due to their neg­a­tive im­pact on Emer­sion’s profit mar­gins.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Ngiam also agreed to give bribes to 45-year-old Loh Kum Ming, who was a sales spe­cial­ist with Sing­tel at that time.</p>
    <p>Tay Yew Kiat, 49, the busi­ness devel­op­ment man­ager of Emer­sion then, had told Loh that Ngiam would be will­ing to of­fer cash or any­thing of mon­e­tary value if he could rec­om­mend Emer­sion to Sing­tel for projects in­volv­ing pub­lic Wi-Fi pro­gramme Wire­less@SG</p>
    <p>Ngiam said that “any­thing could be ar­ranged” for Loh, court doc­u­ments state.</p>
    <p>Agree­ing to the ar­range­ment, Loh told Tay to lower Emer­sion’s ex­ist­ing quo­ta­tions for two projects and rec­om­mended the re­vised quo­ta­tions to his su­pe­rior.</p>
    <p>He also ad­vised Ngiam on the quo­ta­tions for two other projects in 2018, be­fore also rec­om­mend­ing them to his su­pe­rior.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Emer­sion was awarded all four projects.</p>
    <p>The cases for Teo and Loh are still pend­ing. Court records do not state if Tay has been dealt with.</p>
    <p>For each of his of­fences, Ngiam could have been jailed for up to five years and/or fined up to $100,000.</p>
