    <p>I agree with Mr Fran­cis Chu, co-founder of cy­cling group Love Cy­cling SG, that the up­dated pedes­trian code of con­duct is un­nec­es­sary and open to abuse by ag­gres­sive cy­clists (Pedes­tri­ans urged to keep left on shared paths in code of con­duct, Aug 5).</p>
    <p>Also, it takes away pedes­tri­ans’ joy of walk­ing hand in hand or side by side be­cause all pedes­tri­ans would now be ex­pected to keep left.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing to­wards codes of con­duct in­stead of leg­is­la­tion is good. But to avoid right-of-way con­fu­sion and abuse, we need a bolder code on pedes­trian paths.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the high­way code for ze­bra cross­ings forces all mo­torists to keep a look­out for pedes­tri­ans at all times lest they be pe­nalised for ac­ci­dents as pedes­tri­ans have un­equiv­o­cal right of way there.</p>
    <p>Us­ing “the pedes­trian is king on pave­ments” would serve as a clearer code of con­duct, not just for pedes­tri­ans, but for all pave­ment users.</p>
    <p>It would put the heav­ier bur­den of care on less vul­ner­a­ble pave­ment users, such as cy­clists, who should be the ones given the re­spon­si­bil­ity to sig­nal to pedes­tri­ans that they want to pass, wait un­til it is given or over­take the pedes­trian on the grass patch if it is safe to do so.</p>
    <p>In fact, we should com­ple­ment codes of con­duct with clev­erer pave­ment de­signs to nudge both pedes­tri­ans and cy­clists to­wards safe be­hav­iour on foot­paths.</p>
    <p>In­stead of pro­vid­ing sep­a­rate “cy­cling paths” which would then be in­vaded by pedes­tri­ans like they are now, pro­vide a sin­gle foot­path for pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>Then, equip these paths with over­tak­ing strips which are con­ducive for cy­clists but un­pleas­ant for pedes­tri­ans to walk on.</p>
    <p>Per­fo­rated-slab grass pavers cur­rently used in many carparks come to mind. This ap­proach would even save more land for green­ery.</p>
    <p>The same ap­proach can be ap­plied to ded­i­cated bi­cy­cle cross­ings. Pedes­tri­ans would stay off the un­pleas­ant sur­face, while cy­clists would pre­fer the clearer paths.</p>
