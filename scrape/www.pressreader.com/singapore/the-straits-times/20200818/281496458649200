    <p>“Let go of ev­ery­thing around you and fo­cus on this art­work.”</p>
    <p>This is the re­frain that runs through the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore’s Slow Art pro­gramme, which ap­plies the prin­ci­ples of mind­ful­ness to art ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>This is no snap and dash – here, you can stare at a sin­gle work of art for half an hour.</p>
    <p>Over video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom, do­cent Sylvia Peh, 56, walks at­ten­dees through study­ing a paint­ing – Malaysian artist Chia Yu Chian’s blue-toned hos­pi­tal scene The Treat­ment (1980), based on the artist’s fre­quent hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, though this con­text is not revealed un­til much later – and guides them through a se­ries of ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>Think of a song to lis­ten to while look­ing at this paint­ing. Choose a char­ac­ter i n the paint­ing and sketch him or her from mem­ory. If you could ask some­one in the paint­ing a ques­tion, what would it be?</p>
    <p>“I would like to ask the boy with the crutches – does he feel lonely?” says a par­tic­i­pant. “He’s al­most sep­a­rate from the other peo­ple in the paint­ing.”</p>
    <p>As the Covid-19 pan­demic drags on, fill­ing lives with un­cer­tainty and iso­lat­ing peo­ple from one an­other, some lo­cal mu­se­ums have taken to an­gling their pro­grammes around self-care and mind­ful­ness.</p>
    <p>The con­nec­tion be­tween art and well­ness is an old one, says Ms Suenne Me­gan Tan, Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore di­rec­tor of au­di­ence devel­op­ment and en­gage­ment. It has, how­ever, emerged as espe­cially vi­tal dur­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“These pro­grammes al­low au­di­ences to feel up­lifted dur­ing this very chal­leng­ing pe­riod – pre­vi­ously of phys­i­cal iso­la­tion, now of safely dis­tanc­ing in place – such that they can con­tinue to feel con­nected to a larger com­mu­nity,” says Ms Tan, 45.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Gallery and Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum de­vel­oped an art ther­apy pro­gramme for health­care work­ers based on the Care Col­lec­tion, a se­lec­tion of 30 art­works from the Na­tional Col­lec­tion spe­cially curated based on themes such as courage, re­silience and hope.</p>
    <p>The works range from Ez­zam Rah­man’s Here’s who I am, I am what you see (2015), an in­stal­la­tion of flow­ers made from dead skin from the soles of the artist’s feet; to Sarah Choo Jing’s The Hid­den Di­men­sion II (2013), a looped mul­ti­me­dia in­stal­la­tion that de­picts seven fam­ily mem­bers go­ing about their daily rou­tines in the var­i­ous rooms of their house, iso­lated from one an­other ex­cept for a sin­gle mo­ment when they all look up in tan­dem at one an­other and the viewer.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH) art ther­a­pist Dian Han­dayani, 42, picks one art­work ev­ery week for the par­tic­i­pants of the SingHealth iThrive Art­pre­ci­ate pro­gramme to fo­cus on.</p>
    <p>The half-hour ses­sions, held over Zoom weekly, started in June at SGH. There are plans to ex­pand them to all health­care work­ers and staff un­der the SingHealth clus­ter, in­clud­ing KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal and poly­clin­ics, and even­tu­ally to run them as phys­i­cal classes in one of the hos­pi­tals when so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules al­low it.</p>
    <p>Ms Dian guides the par­tic­i­pants to view, re­flect and em­body the art­work. “I do so by ask­ing them lead­ing ques­tions, such as, ‘How does this art­work make you feel?’ or ‘Is any­thing in the pic­ture a sym­bol of some­thing you can re­late to?’ The ques­tions I ask are to en­cour­age the par­tic­i­pants to let go of their ev­ery­day stresses and to fo­cus on be­ing mind­fully pre­sent in the ses­sion,” she says.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan says: “What Dian es­sen­tially does for the health­care work­ers is cre­ate a men­tal oa­sis in the mid­dle of a very fre­netic day.”</p>
    <p>Ms Dian had in­tended to con­duct the ses­sions with five or six par­tic­i­pants to keep them in­ti­mate, but has been get­ting an av­er­age of 11 par­tic­i­pants a week and is look­ing to open up to at least 20 peo­ple to meet de­mand.</p>
    <p>Ms Jenny Tan, an as­so­ci­ate in Sengkang Com­mu­nity Hos­pi­tal’s of­fice of pa­tient ex­pe­ri­ence, says of the ses­sion she at­tended: “It gave me a sense of tran­quil­lity and I came out of it feel­ing more as­sured and con­fi­dent.”</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of the art ther­apy pro­gramme led the Na­tional Gallery to de­velop Slow Art, which is free to the pub­lic. Else­where, it has also moved its on­go­ing mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary art pro­gramme Art + Live, which pro­motes con­nec­tion be­tween art and the self, on­line.</p>
    <p>In ses­sions live-streamed from the gallery’s Face­book page, mu­si­cians BL Duo have played pieces in­spired by Fu Cha, Cao Fei’s boat-like in­stal­la­tion i n the Ng Teng Fong Roof Gar­den Gallery, while so­matic ther­a­pist and movement artist Vin­cent Yong has used Ng Eng Teng’s i conic sculp­ture Mother And Child to guide par­tic­i­pants through movement at home.</p>
    <p>“Part of that ex­er­cise is re­ally to get you in touch with your body,” says the Na­tional Gallery’s Ms Tan of the ses­sions by Yong.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s not just a phys­i­cal con­nec­tion, but also your men­tal state, how your state of mind and body needs to be aligned.”</p>
    <p>The ses­sions, avail­able on the gallery’s Face­book page, can draw a few thou­sand view­ers. In the next in­stal­ment on Aug 29, vi­o­lin­ist Lyn­nette Seah will per­form mu­sic pieces in re­sponse to art­works from the Per­ma­nent Galleries.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the Na­tional Gallery also launched Words That Count, a web­site which al­lows the pub­lic to write black­out po­ems – cre­ated by eras­ing words from a base text – us­ing the let­ters writ­ten by pi­o­neer artist Ge­or­gette Chen. They can then ded­i­cate these to health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>At the ArtS­cience Mu­seum, art is some­times about tak­ing a deep breath. The mu­seum worked with the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion for Men­tal Health (SAMH) on Make Your Own: Breath­ing Vi­su­al­i­sa­tion, a vir­tual pro­gramme with a guided breath­work ex­er­cise, af­ter which par­tic­i­pants trans­lated the rhythm of their breath onto paper as line art.</p>
    <p>The work­shop, which ran on Aug 7, was based on Ger­man artist John Franzen’s Each Line One Breath works, in which he lets his breath guide his hand in sim­ple line draw­ings that ac­cu­mu­late into mas­sive pieces.</p>
    <p>These pro­grammes al­low au­di­ences to feel up­lifted dur­ing this very chal­leng­ing pe­riod – pre­vi­ously of phys­i­cal iso­la­tion, now of safely dis­tanc­ing in place – such that they can con­tinue to feel con­nected to a larger com­mu­nity. ’’</p>
    <p>MS SUENNE ME­GAN TAN of Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore, on the mu­seum’s</p>
    <p>Slow Art pro­gramme which ap­plies the prin­ci­ples of mind­ful­ness to art ap­pre­ci­a­tion</p>
    <p>SAMH pro­gramme ex­ec­u­tive Is­abel Su, 30, says: “The cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion is a stres­sor for many, caus­ing height­ened anx­i­ety and worry. This shows up as ten­sion in the phys­i­cal body which par­tic­i­pants may not even no­tice when they are not breath­ing gen­er­ously.”</p>
    <p>Trans­lat­ing the rhythm of breath­ing into paper, she adds, can help par­tic­i­pants to fo­cus and presents a tan­gi­ble vi­su­al­i­sa­tion of their breath­ing process.</p>
    <p>Ms Su says: “When this is prac­tised in the long run, it may also be ben­e­fi­cial for men­tal well­be­ing, blood pres­sure, heart rate, di­ges­tion and deep tis­sue re­pair.”</p>
    <p>Says the Na­tional Gallery’s Ms Tan: “I think arts and well­ness is a seg­ment that’s be­come even more rel­e­vant dur­ing this time of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“As a gallery, we see our­selves con­tin­u­ing to sus­tain a level of pro­gram­ming that re­ally looks at the restora­tive prop­er­ties and heal­ing pow­ers of art.”</p>
