    <p>CHICAGO A top US sci­en­tist over­see­ing Covid-19 vac­cine tri­als ex­pects a large Amer­i­can study to de­ter­mine how ef­fec­tive the ex­per­i­men­tal in­oc­u­la­tion from As­tra Zeneca is, fol­low­ing per­plex­ing re­sults from other tri­als re­leased by the com­pany and its part­ner Ox­ford Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca is among the lead­ing de­vel­op­ers of Covid-19 vac­cines, but in­terim data re­leased on Nov 23 from tri­als in Bri­tain and Brazil shows a vastly di­ver­gent per­for­mance when the vac­cine was tested in two dif­fer­ent dose com­bi­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said a small group of trial sub­jects in­ad­ver­tently re­ceived a half dose fol­lowed by a full dose, in­stead of the planned two full doses. In that group, the vac­cine proved to be 90 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing ill­ness.</p>
    <p>But the larger group that re­ceived two full doses showed a 62 per cent suc­cess rate. Although 62 per cent ef­fi­cacy is above the bench­mark set by reg­u­la­tors to de­clare a Covid-19 vac­cine a suc­cess, it pales when com­pared with ef­fi­cacy of 95 per cent and 94.1 per cent demon­strated in large tri­als for vac­cines from Pfizer and Moderna, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>A US study of As­traZeneca’s vac­cine in­volv­ing about 30,000 vol­un­teers is in the works and should pro­duce data by late Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“We feel very com­fort­able that we de­signed a re­ally good trial in the United States, where ev­ery­body’s get­ting boosted in a uni­form time, and we know what the dose is,” said Dr Larry Corey, coleader of the US Coro­n­avirus Vac­cine Preven­tion Net­work, who helped de­sign and is over­see­ing tri­als for the US gov­ern­ment’s Oper­a­tion Warp Speed pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the US gov­ern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert Dr An­thony Fauci said the Christ­mas hol­i­day sea­son could pose greater risks than Thanks­giv­ing when it comes to spread­ing the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Thanks­giv­ing travel and gath­er­ings typ­i­cally take place for a shorter pe­riod of time, while Christ­mas events may con­tinue through Hanukkah and New Year cel­e­bra­tions, Dr Fauci said, in re­marks made at the Milken In­sti­tute’s Fu­ture of Health sum­mit on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Christ­mas “ex­tends that vul­ner­a­ble pe­riod by two to three times”, Dr Fauci said, and could pave the way for an­other surge.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia on Mon­day com­pelled much of the state to close shop and stay home, and New York or­dered hos­pi­tals to i ncrease bed ca­pac­ity by 25 per cent, as the US braced it­self for yet an­other coro­n­avirus surge dur­ing the up­com­ing hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The or­der from Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som came into ef­fect one day after the state set a record with more than 30,000 new Covid-19 cases, trig­gered in ar­eas of South­ern Cal­i­for­nia where fewer than 15 per cent of in­ten­sive care hos­pi­tal beds re­main avail­able.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has, mean­while, named Cal­i­for­nia At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Xavier Be­cerra as his Health and Hu­man Ser­vices sec­re­tary, and mostly filled out a team that will lead the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>His se­lec­tions so far in­clude Dr Vivek Murthy, who is set to re­turn to the role of sur­geon gen­eral, a job he held un­der pres­i­dent Barack Obama, while also help­ing man­age the US gov­ern­ment re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeff Zients, one of Mr Bi­den’s tran­si­tion co-chairs, has been named co­or­di­na­tor of the Covid-19 re­sponse and coun­sel­lor to the pres­i­dent. Dr Rochelle Walen­sky, the in­fec­tious dis­eases chief at Mas­sachusetts Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, will be direc­tor of the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion.</p>
    <p>In­terim data re­leased on Nov 23 from tri­als in Bri­tain and Brazil shows a vastly di­ver­gent per­for­mance... A small group re­ceived a half dose fol­lowed by a full dose, in­stead of the planned two full doses... the vac­cine proved to be 90 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>But the larger group that re­ceived two full doses showed a 62 per cent suc­cess rate.</p>
