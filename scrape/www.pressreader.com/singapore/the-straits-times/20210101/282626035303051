    <p>Shang­hai res­tau­rant Yan’s Din­ing is com­mem­o­rat­ing the cen­ten­nial of le­gendary Chi­nese singer and movie star Zhou Xuan with a two-month event in­spired by her ev­er­green songs. Called An Evening With Shang­hai Diva Zhou Xuan, the highlight is an eight-course menu of dishes named af­ter some of her most fa­mous num­bers.</p>
    <p>Dinner starts with a quar­tet of cold dishes ap­pro­pri­ately named af­ter the song Hymn For The Sea­sons, with each dish con­tain­ing an in­gre­di­ent associated with the four sea­sons.</p>
    <p>Other cour­ses in­clude Fam­ily Bliss, which is a crab meat­ball known as lion’s head in a full-bodied Chi­nese cab­bage soup. There is also In The Mood For Love, com­pris­ing a braised prawn with fish maw in a thick golden gravy.</p>
    <p>My favourite is Shang­hai Night (above), a heady dish of hairy crab mar­i­nated in Shaox­ing wine flavoured with pre­served plum and herbs.</p>
    <p>Priced at $168 a per­son, the menu in­cludes a glass each of cham­pagne and co­gnac.</p>
    <p>As each dish is served, strains of the cor­re­spond­ing song waft through the res­tau­rant to evoke a feel of Shang­hai in the 1930s and 1940s when Zhou was at the height of her fame.</p>
    <p>On the walls hang Chi­nese cal­lig­ra­phy works of the song ti­tles and lyrics by artist Grace Chen Liang, as well as paint­ings by artist Mo Ni. A com­pos­ite of Zhou’s movie fly­ers greets din­ers at the res­tau­rant’s en­trance.</p>
    <p>The pro­mo­tion was orig­i­nally sched­uled to end to­day, but has been ex­tended to the end of next month to cover the Chi­nese New Year sea­son. Some dishes like hairy crab may be changed when sea­sonal in­gre­di­ents are no longer avail­able.</p>
    <p>There is also a seven-course menu, mi­nus the crab, and al­co­hol at $98 a per­son.</p>
