    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>It is too easy to let am­bi­gu­ity slide, so make sure you are mak­ing your­self as clear as can be. Ask folks to re­peat to you what you just said if it is re­ally important.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Scep­ti­cism is your best as­set. Does that mean you should shoot ev­ery­one down? Of course not, but you might save the day by ask­ing the right ques­tion at the right time.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your flirty style is mak­ing waves, but they are the good kind. You may be able to surf on them and have a blast mak­ing peo­ple won­der where you will end up. It is all good fun for you.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You face some de­tails that do not add up. They are important though, so you have to go over them again and again un­til you can make sense of them. Take as much time as you need.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are hav­ing a tough time mak­ing up your mind be­tween two ap­peal­ing al­ter­na­tives to­day. There is no need to rush. Check out all the op­tions and then de­cide what you want most.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Work is on your mind – it could be that you have too much on your plate, that you need a new gig or maybe just that you want a raise. What­ever it is, you have the right mind­set to make it work.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is ter­rific, es­pe­cially when it comes to men­tal or so­cial pursuits. You should find that you can im­press peo­ple on many dif­fer­ent lev­els while solv­ing prob­lems and look­ing good.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>A tiny flaw sets off loud warning bells, so make sure you are paying at­ten­tion. If you do not no­tice any tiny de­tail out of place, then you may want to call in re­in­force­ments to check your work.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>To­day’s big busi­ness is en­tirely up to you, so act like the world de­pends on your ev­ery action. You should do just fine, but only if you put your all into even the small­est ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing a bit less fo­cused than usual and it is far too easy for you to fall into dis­trac­tion. You may want to fil­ter your e-mail and turn off so­cial me­dia chan­nels for the day, if pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You have noth­ing to lose and plenty to gain, so make sure you are telling the right peo­ple what is re­ally pos­si­ble. Only you can share this new idea with the world, so go for it.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your dual na­ture does not pop up all that of­ten but when it does, it can wreak all kinds of havoc. You may ar­gue with your­self out loud, so be pre­pared for some weird looks.</p>
