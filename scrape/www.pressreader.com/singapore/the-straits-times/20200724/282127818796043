    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s in­creased em­pha­sis on clean en­ergy will put it in line with the global shift to­wards a low-car­bon world.</p>
    <p>Re­cent ini­tia­tives such as JTC Corp’s ten­der for its So­larRoof pro­gramme to help com­pa­nies adopt so­lar en­ergy, Senoko’s pi­lot project on re­new­able en­ergy trade, and the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s (MAS) new­est pri­or­ity to make Sin­ga­pore a lead­ing hub for green fi­nance are all steps in that di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is on track to reach its so­lar en­ergy gen­er­a­tion tar­get of 350 megawatt-peak (MWp) by the end of this year, ac­cord­ing to the En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>The next tar­get is a min­i­mum of 2 gi­gawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030 – rep­re­sent­ing 4 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal elec­tric­ity de­mand, up from about 1 per cent now. Sin­ga­pore also has a tar­get to de­ploy 200MW of en­ergy stor­age ca­pac­ity be­yond 2025, to bal­ance peak-and-trough de­mand within power net­works to en­sure sys­tem sta­bil­ity and re­li­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Tran­si­tion to a low-car­bon world is no longer just an as­pi­ra­tional goal, but is backed by rapidly fall­ing de­vel­op­ment costs, in­vest­ments from main­stream in­vestors as well as en­vi­ron­ment-re­lated tar­gets set by gov­ern­ments and com­pa­nies across the world.</p>
    <p>The de­mand for re­new­able en­ergy has also proved re­silient at a time when power con­sump­tion has taken a his­toric hit be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency (IEA) es­ti­mates that due to the coro­n­avirus-in­duced global re­ces­sion, en­ergy de­mand will plum­met by 6 per cent this year – the largest drop since World War II.</p>
    <p>But at the same time, the IEA es­ti­mates re­new­able en­ergy de­mand will rise by about 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>De­mand for coal is pro­jected to de­cline 8 per cent, gas by 5 per cent, and nu­clear en­ergy by 2 per cent. Crude oil con­sump­tion is set to slide by about 9 per cent, the worst drop since the 1990-91 Gulf War.</p>
    <p>Re­new­able en­ergy is now a se­ri­ous con­tender against fos­sil fu­els in terms of costs for new projects.</p>
    <p>So­lar pho­to­voltaic (PV) sys­tems and on­shore wind are the most af­ford­able sources of new­build gen­er­a­tion for at least two-thirds of the world pop­u­la­tion, which ac­counts for 71 per cent of global gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and 85 per cent of elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tion, ac­cord­ing to the in­ter-govern­men­tal In­ter­na­tional Re­new­able En­ergy Agency.</p>
    <p>The lev­elised cost of en­ergy (LCOE) – a mea­sure of the av­er­age net present cost of elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tion for a gen­er­at­ing plant over its life­time – for PV sys­tems and on­shore wind has dropped rad­i­cally over the past decade, by 88 per cent and 60 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the LCOE of both so­lar PV and on­shore wind be­came cheaper than the US$100 LCOE range for fos­sil fuel.</p>
    <p>Mr Su­vro Sarkar, en­ergy an­a­lyst at DBS Bank, said: “The Covid-19 pan­demic dented en­ergy de­mand se­verely. But while de­mand for tra­di­tional fos­sil fuel sources like oil, coal and nat­u­ral gas are headed for their worst de­clines in his­tory, re­new­able en­ergy stands out as the most re­silient – with a likely flat­line con­tri­bu­tion to the global grid, thereby in­creas­ing its share in the over­all en­ergy pie.</p>
    <p>“The rel­a­tive re­silience of re­new­able en­ergy could drive in­vest­ment into lower-risk, lower-re­turn busi­ness mod­els typ­i­cal of the in­dus­try, rather than in­creas­ing ex­po­sure to more volatile mar­ket dy­nam­ics of tra­di­tional en­ergy.</p>
    <p>“Hence, re­new­ables are no longer an ex­otic high-price dream. It is main­stream and does not leave much scope for ex­cuses (for non-adop­tion).”</p>
    <p>A re­cent DBS sur­vey found that more than 50 per cent of en­ergy in­dus­try play­ers across Asia be­lieve that re­new­able power gen­er­a­tion was the most at­trac­tive seg­ment of the en­ergy value chain from a new in­vest­ment point of view.</p>
    <p>Still, higher cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture re­quire­ments to in­vest in or ac­quire ca­pa­bil­i­ties in lower-car­bon so­lu­tions are tipped to be the big­gest chal­lenge, most sur­vey par­tic­i­pants said.</p>
    <p>That means fi­nanc­ing re­quire­ments will play a key role.</p>
    <p>MAS’ green fi­nance ac­tion plan an­nounced last year was in re­sponse to the fund­ing chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to MAS, green and sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing flows have in­creased steadily in Sin­ga­pore since last year and have re­mained strong through the first half of this year de­spite the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is now Asean’s largest green fi­nance mar­ket, ac­count­ing for close to 50 per cent of cu­mu­la­tive Asean green bond and green loan is­suances for cli­mate and en­vi­ron­men­tal projects by both lo­cal and over­seas com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>More than $8 bil­lion in green, so­cial and sus­tain­abil­ity bonds have been is­sued in Sin­ga­pore to date, with ap­prox­i­mately</p>
    <p>$750 mil­lion in green and so­cial bonds is­sued out of Sin­ga­pore so far this year.</p>
    <p>Last year alone, Sin­ga­pore en­ti­ties orig­i­nated close to $5.5 bil­lion worth of green loans and sus­tain­abil­ity-linked loans (SLLs) – ac­count­ing for over 35 per cent of SLLs in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>And even amid the tu­mult in the fi­nan­cial world, Sin­ga­pore banks have con­tin­ued to sup­port com­pa­nies with new SLLs,</p>
    <p>MAS said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent Econ­o­mist In­tel­li­gence Unit study com­mis­sioned by Amundi As­set Man­age­ment, Asia’s banks and com­pa­nies have gone from 1 per cent of green bond is­suance in 2013 to 45 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Two-thirds of green bonds is­sued in Asean coun­tries were used to fi­nance re­new­able en­ergy and en­ergy ef­fi­ciency projects, ac­cord­ing to an Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank In­sti­tute re­port in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Amundi’s study, how­ever, noted that Asia’s green fixed-in­come mar­ket orig­i­nates from a nar­row base, and that many ob­sta­cles re­main in turn­ing Asia’s fi­nance greener.</p>
    <p>Even glob­ally, is­suance of green fixed-in­come se­cu­ri­ties reached only US$350 bil­lion (S$484 bil­lion) last year – just 5 per cent of the global fixed-in­come mar­ket.</p>
    <p>While chal­lenges re­main, Mr Sarkar said the long-term up­trend of re­new­able en­ergy de­vel­op­ment will re­main in­tact be­cause of the rapidly de­creas­ing de­vel­op­ment costs and the un­avoid­able need by gov­ern­ments and cor­po­ra­tions to meet cli­mate change and en­vi­ron­ment-re­lated tar­gets.</p>
    <p>“The in­flec­tion point is be­hind us, a wait-and-watch pol­icy is no longer valid, and legacy play­ers need to ad­just busi­ness mod­els to em­brace the tran­si­tion, or risk fall­ing be­hind. In ad­di­tion, pol­i­cy­mak­ers glob­ally need to take this op­por­tu­nity to re­cal­i­brate their green goals as well, par­tic­u­larly in Asian coun­tries,” he said.</p>
