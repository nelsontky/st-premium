    <p>At the end of Septem­ber, the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion posted a list of rec­om­men­da­tions for how Amer­i­cans can safely cel­e­brate Thanks­giv­ing this year. Eat all the pie you want (but only with your im­me­di­ate fam­ily). At­tend pa­rades and big games (but only on TV). Shop till you drop (from the couch). Skip the flight back home (Zoom with your rel­a­tives in­stead). Give thanks (while main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tance).</p>
    <p>As a Cana­dian, I ex­pe­ri­enced this vir­tual ver­sion of Thanks­giv­ing last month, pre­ceded by the Jewish High Holy Days a few weeks be­fore that. Nor­mally, on the night be­fore Yom Kip­pur, I would dress in a suit and walk to a nearby syn­a­gogue, to hear my brother-in-law sing the Kol Nidre prayer. But ris­ing case num­bers in Toronto made that un­wise, so my wife and I sat on the couch and streamed a pro­gramme that fea­tured an ar­ray of voices rep­re­sent­ing a cross-sec­tion of the Jewish ex­pe­ri­ence, from Iraqi can­tors and LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) rab­bis, to a short film about Black Lives Mat­ter. It was beau­ti­ful, mean­ing­ful and just one of hun­dreds of on­line ser­vices we could have tuned into that night.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept I could not bring my­self back to spend an­other mo­ment in front of a screen the next morn­ing. My neigh­bour told me about a ser­vice in a nearby park, so we walked over and sat 2m apart. The con­gre­ga­tion was far more tra­di­tional than what I am used to, and I could barely fol­low along with the He­brew, but as the sun shone down and we sang Av­inu Malkeinu, a 1,500-year-old prayer for for­give­ness, the feel­ing of those col­lec­tive voices be­hind their masks sent a shiver down my spine. Here, for the first time since March, I was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing some­thing that was real, vis­ceral and un­able to be digi­tised.</p>
    <p>It was not fu­tur­is­tic. In fact, it was about as time­less a mo­ment as it gets.</p>
    <p>It feels like we heard for years that when it came to work, school, God or gro­ceries, the vir­tual fu­ture – the mo­ment when we would use screens and tech­nol­ogy for ev­ery­thing in life – was around the cor­ner. Then one day in March, that fu­ture ap­peared at our doorstep un­in­vited.</p>
    <p>As ex­perts try to fore­cast what the world will look like once the virus is be­hind us, it is now com­mon to hear that we are just at the start of this “new nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>Of­fices and down­towns will be aban­doned as many of us per­ma­nently work from home.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion will be de­liv­ered from a screen. Gyms will floun­der, while Pelo­ton flour­ishes. Ghost kitchens and de­liv­ery apps will take the place of shut­tered restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The phys­i­cal, ana­logue world that ex­isted be­fore the pan­demic is but a fad­ing relic.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem with these prediction­s is that they are the same ones that have been used to sell us soft­ware and de­vices for the past sev­eral decades, with the same prom­ises of ef­fi­ciency. They al­most al­ways typ­i­cally fall short when they meet the real world.</p>
    <p>Seven years ago, tech in­vestor Marc An­dreessen claimed that re­tail stores would soon go out of busi­ness, as e-com­merce ate their lunch. But while Ama­zon and other on­line re­tail­ers grew rapidly dur­ing this time, and their growth ex­ploded dur­ing the ini­tial peak of the pan­demic lock­down, e-com­merce in the United States still ac­counts for only around</p>
    <p>16 per cent of re­tail sales. Malls, shop­ping streets, book­stores and other icons of phys­i­cal re­tail, though bat­tered and fight­ing for sur­vival, are still open and in many cases doing brisk busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Shop­ping re­mains a deeply hu­man ac­tion that can serve as ed­u­ca­tion, en­ter­tain­ment and community build­ing all at once.</p>
    <p>That same thing can be true with work. “Of­fice cen­tric­ity is over,” pro­claimed Mr To­bias Lutke, chief ex­ec­u­tive of e-com­merce soft­ware firm Shopify, in May, declar­ing that it had no in­ten­tion of re­turn­ing to its beau­ti­ful and brand-new of­fices in Toronto.</p>
    <p>But many of us have found that re­mote work is any­thing but dreamy. We can­not con­cen­trate, we feel un­mo­ti­vated, we have chil­dren quite lit­er­ally crawl­ing all over us. We deeply miss hav­ing somewhere to go, a rea­son to shower and dress up, and most im­por­tantly, a col­lec­tive sense of pur­pose forged with the peo­ple we work with side by side.</p>
    <p>Per­haps nowhere has seen the promised Eden of tech­no­log­i­cal fu­tur­ism run into the hard ground of earthly re­al­ity more harshly than in ed­u­ca­tion. In 2018, pro­fes­sor of en­trepreneur­ship and in­no­va­tion Vivek Wad­hwa in Sil­i­con Val­ley pre­dicted that “the fu­ture of ed­u­ca­tion is vir­tual”, pow­ered by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-en­abled, vir­tual re­al­ity head­sets. In­stead, the on­line learn­ing most stu­dents, teach­ers and par­ents ex­pe­ri­enced this spring, and are con­tin­u­ing this au­tumn, is best char­ac­terised as a vast dis­ap­point­ment. Tech­ni­cal fail­ures abound at ev­ery turn, work is left un­touched and many feel aban­doned.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent sur­vey of ed­u­ca­tors from 59 coun­tries, more than half said the ex­per­i­ment in e-learn­ing had re­sulted in stu­dents learn­ing less than they would if they were in school.</p>
    <p>I saw this with my own chil­dren. Each day in lock­down was a long bat­tle with a poorly de­signed soft­ware in­ter­face, punc­tu­ated by vo­cal bat­tles over as­sign­ments. “I miss school,” my daugh­ter said one night in April. I re­minded her that she was at­tend­ing school, just on­line. “No, dad, real school,” she replied, break­ing into tears. “On­line’s just the work, without any of the fun.”</p>
    <p>Now, she and her brother put on their masks and run laugh­ing into the school­yard to meet their friends each morn­ing, while their brave, bril­liant teach­ers pre­pare them for an­other day in the world.</p>
    <p>It turns out that school is more than just facts trans­ferred from text­book or web­site to learn­ers. It is an im­mer­sive en­vi­ron­ment that fa­cil­i­tates learn­ing through a pur­pose­fully de­signed phys­i­cal space and care­fully crafted re­la­tion­ships that equal some­thing far greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
    <p>While the dig­i­tal tools we have clung to in these past months are not go­ing away, it is a false as­sump­tion that this state of emer­gency is a sign of the fu­ture. Learn­ing, play­ing, so­cial­is­ing and spend­ing all our time on the same screen in the same house, day af­ter day af­ter day, is not the de­sir­able utopian fu­ture we had hoped for. It is a prison of dig­i­tal lux­ury.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has caused us to see the value of the real world; in the mun­dane joy of a drab of­fice, the mir­a­cle of a creaky pub­lic school class­room. It has given us a new ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the sin­gu­lar ex­pe­ri­ence of sit­ting around a hol­i­day ta­ble – talk­ing pol­i­tics with rel­a­tives that we both love and can­not stand, eat­ing way too much turkey and pie and ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the emo­tional and phys­i­cal full­ness that feast in­duces.</p>
    <p>Re­al­ity is still where the ac­tion is, and though we are forced to stick to the vir­tual for our safety, as soon as the pan­demic ends most of us will come run­ning back to the world be­yond our screens.</p>
