    <p>TOKYO • The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing the re­sump­tion of in­bound tourism on a lim­ited ba­sis in the spring as Tokyo pre­pares to host a de­layed sum­mer Olympics, the Asahi news­pa­per re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is lean­ing to­wards al­low­ing small tour groups from places in Asia where coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions are well un­der con­trol, such as China and Tai­wan, the Asahi re­ported with­out cit­ing sources.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials did not re­turn calls from Reuters seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s gov­ern­ment has launched a sub­sidy pro­gramme to re­vive do­mes­tic tourism, a key driver of eco­nomic growth in re­cent years, but the scheme has been crit­i­cised be­cause Japan is strug­gling with a third wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>New cases have spiked to record highs in Tokyo and Osaka.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of se­ri­ous cases na­tion­wide has also risen to a record.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new plan, tourists would have to test neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus and sub­mit a de­tailed travel itin­er­ary be­fore en­ter­ing, the Asahi said.</p>
    <p>They would travel only by hired coach and would be sep­a­rated from other cus­tomers at their ho­tel and sight­see­ing des­ti­na­tions, it said. Tourists would also be re­quired to use a trac­ing app and give daily up­dates on their health, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>A lim­ited num­ber of peo­ple are now al­lowed to travel to Japan for busi­ness, but are re­quested to self­iso­late for 14 days.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo Sum­mer Olympics was sched­uled for this year, but was pushed back to next year be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Progress in rolling out coro­n­avirus vac­cines has raised hope that global tourism can start to slowly re­cover from paralysing travel re­stric­tions put in place to curb the out­break.</p>
