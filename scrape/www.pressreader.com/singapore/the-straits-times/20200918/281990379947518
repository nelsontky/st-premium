    <p>The rainy days and chilly nights in re­cent days are com­ing to an end.</p>
    <p>There will be less rain with a few warm days in the sec­ond half of this month, com­pared with the first half, the weath­er­man has said.</p>
    <p>The daily tem­per­a­ture is ex­pected to range be­tween 25 deg C and 33 deg C on most days and may reach a high of around 34 deg C on a few days, ac­cord­ing to the me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Some nights may also be rel­a­tively warm, with tem­per­a­tures hov­er­ing around 28 deg C, es­pe­cially when the pre­vail­ing south-east winds blow warm and hu­mid air from the sea to­wards land.</p>
    <p>As the mon­soon rain band is fore­cast to remain over the equa­to­rial South-east Asia re­gion, mod­er­ate-to-heavy thun­dery show­ers of short du­ra­tion are ex­pected over parts of the is­land be­tween late morn­ing and the af­ter­noon on most days.</p>
    <p>These show­ers may ex­tend into the evening on one or two days.</p>
    <p>The pas­sage of the Su­ma­tra squalls – an or­gan­ised line of thun­der­storms that orig­i­nate over Su­ma­tra is­land or the Strait of Malacca – may bring wide­spread thun­dery show­ers with oc­ca­sional gusty winds in the morn­ing on a few days.</p>
    <p>The weath­er­man said that while rainfall in the com­ing fort­night is ex­pected to be lower than that in the first two weeks of the month, the over­all rainfall for Septem­ber is ex­pected to be higher than av­er­age over most parts of the is­land.</p>
    <p>Over the past fort­night, thun­dery show­ers fell be­tween late morn­ing and the af­ter­noon on most days, and ex­tended into the evening on a few days.</p>
    <p>The show­ers were heav­i­est on the morn­ing of Sept 10. The daily to­tal rainfall recorded that day was 129.6mm in Tuas South, which was also the high­est rainfall read­ing recorded over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The cooler con­di­tions saw the mer­cury drop­ping to 21.8 deg C in Paya Le­bar on Tues­day, the low­est daily min­i­mum tem­per­a­ture so far this month.</p>
