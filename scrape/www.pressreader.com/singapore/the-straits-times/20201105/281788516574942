    <p>BANGKOK • Hun­gary’s for­eign min­is­ter tested pos­i­tive for coro­n­avirus in Thai­land, the king­dom’s health min­is­ter said yes­ter­day, a day after Mr Peter Sz­i­j­jarto jet­ted in from a meet­ing with Cam­bo­dian Pre­mier Hun Sen.</p>
    <p>Mr Sz­i­j­jarto flew into Ph­nom Penh on Tues­day for a one-day of­fi­cial visit to sign agree­ments on civil avi­a­tion, agri­cul­ture and wa­ter man­age­ment, as well as to re­open an em­bassy after a 25-year hia­tus.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day night, he ar­rived in Bangkok and was swiftly taken to hos­pi­tal after test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>The test “showed he has Covid-19, but he didn’t have any symp­toms”, Thai­land’s Health Min­is­ter Anutin Charn­vi­rakul told re­porters after he vis­ited Mr Sz­i­j­jarto at Bam­ras­naradura In­fec­tious Dis­ease In­sti­tute yes­ter­day. “His en­tourage all tested neg­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his Cam­bo­dia visit, Mr Sz­i­j­jarto was pic­tured with Mr Hun Sen at a meet­ing where nei­ther ap­peared to be so­cially dis­tanc­ing or wear­ing a mask. He also met his Cam­bo­dian coun­ter­part and shook hands with other min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>All of them will now be tested and quar­an­tined. “The lead­ers and all of­fi­cials who met and had di­rect con­tact with the del­e­ga­tion... will be tested for Covid-19 and quar­an­tined,” Cam­bo­dia’s For­eign Af­fairs Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sz­i­j­jarto’s sched­uled meet­ings in the Thai cap­i­tal were can­celled, and an ex­tra plane was or­dered from Hun­gary to trans­port him home, sep­a­rately from his staff.</p>
