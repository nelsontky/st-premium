    <p>A man is ac­cused of con­ning 69 peo­ple of more than $98,000 in a scam in­volv­ing dis­counted haj tours that did not ex­ist.</p>
    <p>The al­leged vic­tims were each cheated of be­tween $400 and $1,950.</p>
    <p>Mohd Ram­lee Ab Sa­mad, who used to be a di­rec­tor at a firm known as Cos­mos Air­freight, is also ac­cused of dup­ing at least 15 oth­ers into hand­ing over their pass­ports by us­ing a sim­i­lar ruse.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old Sin­ga­porean, who is said to have com­mit­ted most of his of­fences in Au­gust 2018, was charged yes­ter­day with 85 counts of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Sun­day, the po­lice said that they had re­ceived a call on Aug 15, 2018, stat­ing that 80 peo­ple who had paid for a haj tour did not re­ceive con­fir­ma­tion for their flight and visa de­tails.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers ar­rested Ram­lee on</p>
    <p>Oct 4 that year over his sus­pected in­volve­ment in the scam.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment, the po­lice said: “In­ves­ti­ga­tions un­cov­ered ev­i­dence that the man had de­ceived the vic­tims into hand­ing over their pass­ports and monies amount­ing to more than $98,000 with the false prom­ise of a haj trip.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments, the al­leged vic­tims handed over their money and pass­ports to a man iden­ti­fied as Fahro­razi So­hoi, now 49, who ran a lo­cal tour agency.</p>
    <p>Fahro­razi, who was a well­known Sin­ga­porean reli­gious teacher, was charged in Au­gust 2018 with one count of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>He had been ac­cused of dup­ing a man into pay­ing him $1,550 to per­form a “VIP haj” at the in­vi­ta­tion of the Saudi Em­bassy.</p>
    <p>Fahro­razi has since been given a dis­charge not amount­ing to an ac­quit­tal on this charge.</p>
    <p>This means he can be pros­e­cuted again if new ev­i­dence were to sur­face.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Reli­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) had ear­lier said that it had no com­ment on Fahro­razi’s case as it was still un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not re­veal de­tails about his al­leged roles in</p>
    <p>Ram­lee’s charges yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have ad­vised mem­bers of the pub­lic who want to per­form the haj to make in­quiries on haj reg­is­tra­tion with Muis.</p>
    <p>Mus­lims world­wide travel to Saudi Ara­bia to per­form the an­nual haj pil­grim­age.</p>
    <p>The haj, one of the five pil­lars of Is­lam and a must for able-bod­ied Mus­lims at least once in their life­time, is one of the world’s largest reli­gious gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Ram lee’ s bail was set at $30,000 yes­ter­day and his case has been ad­journed to Aug 31.</p>
