    <p>• Ugan­dan Joshua Chep­tegei smashed the men’s 10,000m world record and Ethiopia’s Lete­sen­bet Gidey de­mol­ished the women’s 5,000m mark as the Va­len­cia World Record Day event lived up to its name on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Chep­tegei crossed the line at a near-empty Turia sta­dium in a stun­ning 26min 11.02sec to beat the time of 26:17:53 set in 2005 by Ethiopian Ke­nenisa Bekele by over six sec­onds.</p>
    <p>“It was my dream. We are try­ing to write his­tory on the track and make peo­ple to know that track is still ex­cit­ing,” the 24-year-old told the Olympic Chan­nel af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>When asked if his feat meant that he has now “achieved great­ness” in ath­let­ics, he added: “I think this is just the foun­da­tion of what I want to achieve in years to come.”</p>
    <p>The achieve­ment capped an out­stand­ing 12 months for Chep­tegei, who won the gold medal in the 10,000m at last year’s World Cham­pi­onships in Doha, and in Au­gust, took Bekele’s 5,000m record at the Di­a­mond League meet­ing in Monaco.</p>
    <p>Last De­cem­ber, also in Va­len­cia, he smashed a decade-long record in 10km road rac­ing by six sec­onds, be­fore claim­ing the world 5km road record in Monaco in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Chep­tegei be­comes only the 10th ath­lete to con­cur­rently hold the 5,000m and 10,000m world records.</p>
    <p>Only 400 peo­ple, in­clud­ing spon­sors, jour­nal­ists and staff, were al­lowed into the event due to strict coro­n­avirus mea­sures in Spain. But Chep­tegei still savoured the moment with a lap of hon­our, wrapped in the Uganda flag and wear­ing a crown.</p>
    <p>His out­stand­ing dis­play fin­ished off a per­fect event from the or­gan­is­ers’ point of view af­ter Gidey, 22, broke the women’s 5,000m world record by more than four sec­onds, cross­ing the line in 14:06.62.</p>
    <p>She eas­ily beat the pre­vi­ous record of 14:11.15 set by her com­pa­triot Tirunesh Dibaba in Oslo in 2008. “This is a long-time dream for me, I’m very happy, this is very big for me,” said Gidey, who started her ca­reer in 2014.</p>
    <p>“I dreamt about this record for six years. I want to thank Va­len­cia for giv­ing me this chance.”</p>
    <p>The event was or­gan­ised by Chep­tegei’s NN Run­ning Team of the Nether­lands, and he and Gidey were helped to the fin­ish line by pac­ers as well as Wave­light tech­nol­ogy, which flashes lights on the in­side of the track to in­di­cate a spe­cific pace. They both wore Nike’s ZoomX Dragon­fly spikes, which been billed as the “fastest shoes ever”, en route to mak­ing his­tory.</p>

The world cham&#xAD;pion also holds the record for the fastest time in the 5,000m.&#xD;&#xA;Be&#xAD;low: Ethiopia&#x2019;s Lete&#xAD;sen&#xAD;bet Gidey snapped the women&#x2019;s 5,000m world record by more than four sec&#xAD;onds, a mark that had stood for seven years be&#xAD;fore the Va&#xAD;len&#xAD;cia meet.</p>
