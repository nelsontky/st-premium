    <p>Sin­ga­pore has con­sci­en­tiously im­ple­mented safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, from hawker cen­tre seats marked out with con­spic­u­ous red crosses of mask­ing tape to the num­ber of mats in yoga classes be­ing dra­mat­i­cally re­duced.</p>
    <p>En­force­ment of­fi­cers and safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors have been de­ployed to en­sure peo­ple com­ply with Sin­ga­pore’s safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But who is polic­ing the skies? I re­cently trav­elled from Lon­don back to Sin­ga­pore with Sin­ga­pore Air­lines. I was more than a lit­tle sur­prised to dis­cover that the flight was full. On a plane that seats 253 pas­sen­gers, there were hardly any empty seats on board.</p>
    <p>When, with equal mea­sures of cu­rios­ity and con­cern, I asked a staff mem­ber whether any mea­sure of dis­tanc­ing could fea­si­bly be im­ple­mented at such ca­pac­ity, the an­swer was that there was no re­quire­ment im­posed on the air­line to en­sure any min­i­mum dis­tance be­tween pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The usual amount of space, or lack thereof, in econ­omy class is fa­mil­iar to most. In the row di­rectly be­hind me sat three pas­sen­gers, all strangers to one an­other – a Sin­ga­porean student re­turn­ing home, a young Aus­tralian woman tran­sit­ing through Sin­ga­pore and an el­derly woman on her way to Malaysia. It’s safe to say they were not from the same house­hold, and had they at­tempted to have a meal to­gether in a hawker cen­tre, such prox­im­ity would not be ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>On the 11th day of my com­pul­sory stay-home no­tice and one day af­ter I was tested for Covid-19, I re­ceived a call from the Min­istry of Health. One per­son who sat near me and two in to­tal on the same flight had tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>I can’t say the news was un­ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Which leads me to this ques­tion: Are all air car­ri­ers ex­empt from the safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures on the ground?</p>
    <p>While the im­age of empty planes perched des­o­lately in the Aus­tralian desert makes the com­mer­cial need to fill up seats cer­tainly un­der­stand­able, this sit­u­a­tion also high­lights a se­ri­ous loop­hole that the govern­ment task force should take steps to ex­am­ine and ad­dress.</p>
    <p>En­force­ment of­fi­cers and safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors have been de­ployed to en­sure peo­ple com­ply with Sin­ga­pore’s safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. But who is polic­ing the skies?</p>
