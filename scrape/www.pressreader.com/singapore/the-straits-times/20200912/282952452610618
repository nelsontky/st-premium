    <p>NEW YORK • Thou­sands of peo­ple launched a call to boy­cott Net­flix on Thurs­day over the French film Mignonnes, an­gry that its young stars were por­trayed in a sex­u­alised way.</p>
    <p>The film, known as Cu­ties in English, is di­rected by FrenchSene­galese direc­tor Maimouna Doucoure and started stream­ing on Wed­nes­day. More than 200,000 tweets with the hash­tag “#CancelNet­flix” be­came the top trend­ing topic one day later.</p>
    <p>A first wave of crit­i­cism l ast month led Net­flix to with­draw “in­ap­pro­pri­ate” art­work used to pro­mote the film, which was re­leased in theatres that month in France.</p>
    <p>Net­flix also said it apol­o­gised for hav­ing used “in­ap­pro­pri­ate” images.</p>
    <p>But on Thurs­day, broader op­po­si­tion to some of the im­agery came from around the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum in the United States.</p>
    <p>Ms DeAnna Lor­raine, a former Re­pub­li­can can­di­date for US Congress from California, tweeted that “Child pornog­ra­phy is il­le­gal in Amer­ica”.</p>
    <p>“As the mother of an eight-yearold girl, I strongly sup­port #CancelNet­flix,” added Ms Beatrice Car­de­nas, another California Re­pub­li­can.</p>
    <p>The film, which re­ceived a direc­tor’s award at the pres­ti­gious Sun­dance Film Fes­ti­val, tells the story of Amy, an 11-year-old Parisian, who must jug­gle the strict rules of her Sene­galese fam­ily and so­cial me­dia’s em­pha­sis on ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>She joins a dance group formed by three other girls from her neigh­bour­hood, whose chore­ogra­phies are some­times sug­ges­tive.</p>
    <p>“The hy­per-sex­u­al­i­sa­tion of girls (and boys) is dis­gust­ing,” tweeted Mr Omar Navarro, another Re­pub­li­can politi­cian. “It is morally and eth­i­cally rep­re­hen­si­ble. Pae­dophiles, child rapists and per­verts</p>
    <p>would have a great time with #Cu­ties.”</p>
    <p>Among the voices prais­ing the movie were Amer­i­can ac­tress Tessa Thomp­son, who found it “beau­ti­ful”.</p>
    <p>“It gut­ted me at @sun­dance­fest,” she said. “It in­tro­duces a fresh voice at the helm. She’s a French</p>
    <p>Sene­galese black wo­man min­ing her ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>“The film com­ments on the hy­per-sex­u­al­i­sa­tion of pre-ado­les­cent girls. Dis­ap­pointed to see the cur­rent dis­course. Dis­ap­pointed to see how it was po­si­tioned in terms of mar­ket­ing,” she added.</p>
