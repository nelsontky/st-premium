    <p>LONDON • Manchester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer vowed that his team will be “100 per cent fresh” for Sun­day’s fi­nal Premier League game at Le­ices­ter as they look to se­cure a Cham­pi­ons League spot amid a hec­tic sched­ule.</p>
    <p>United, beaten 3-1 by Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-fi­nals last Sun­day, looked tired in Wed­nes­day’s 1-1 home draw against West Ham, the fourth match in nine days for Sol­sk­jaer’s side.</p>
    <p>“We’ve not been dealt the best of hands with the re­cov­ery times in the last cou­ple of weeks,” the Nor­we­gian said af­ter United’s 10th match in 33 days.</p>
    <p>“That’s how it is, but we’ve got three days now... the ex­tra day be­fore Sun­day will make us 100 per cent fresh. We’ve given our­selves a great op­por­tu­nity. We wanted to give our­selves the chance to head there and get into the Cham­pi­ons League by beat­ing them. Now, we’d be okay with a draw, but we’ll be go­ing there to win.”</p>
    <p>The fifth-placed Foxes, on 62 points, will have had seven days to pre­pare to leapfrog United, who are third (63), above Chelsea on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>United were well be­low their best against West Ham and fell be­hind fol­low­ing a lapse of con­cen­tra­tion from mid­fielder Paul Pogba.</p>
    <p>De­clan Rice’s free kick just be­fore half-time was smashed straight at the French­man, who in­stinc­tively stuck up his arms to pro­tect his face. De­spite Pogba drop­ping to the turf as though he had been hit in the head, the video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) con­firmed the hand­ball.</p>
    <p>Michail An­to­nio took the spot­kick, send­ing David de Gea the wrong way for his sixth goal in three games. While Pogba apol­o­gised in the dress­ing room at half­time, for­mer United de­fender and pun­dit Gary Neville was not in a for­giv­ing mood. He told Sky Sports: “It’s rub­bish from him, rub­bish... it’s em­bar­rass­ing.”</p>
    <p>Pogba’s for­mer United team­mate Pa­trice Evra was also crit­i­cal of the 27-year-old. “All United fans would like to see Paul bleed­ing even if the ball broke his nose,” said the Sky Sports pun­dit. “It is dif­fi­cult to for­give Paul on this one.”</p>
    <p>For­ward Ma­son Green­wood saved Pogba’s blushes, strik­ing af­ter the in­ter­val to ex­tend United’s un­beaten run in the league to 13 matches. Sol­sk­jaer will also have been re­lieved there were no costly mis­takes from de Gea af­ter the goal­keeper re­tained his place de­spite mak­ing two em­bar­rass­ing er­rors against Chelsea.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est chal­lenge will be to re­vi­talise his slug­gish side.</p>
    <p>No player epit­o­mised United’s tired­ness like tal­is­man Bruno Fer­nan­des, who has played 869 out of a max­i­mum 930 min­utes since foot­ball re­sumed from a coro­n­avirus-en­forced break. The Por­tuguese had one shot at goal – a dip from his pre­vi­ous av­er­age of 3.5 per 90 min­utes – and lost the ball un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions fol­low­ing poor touches. He recorded just five high-in­ten­sity sprints, hav­ing av­er­aged 13 per 90 min­utes in United’s other league games since the restart, re­ported Sky Sports.</p>
    <p>Yet, in a sign that Sol­sk­jaer does not have am­ple faith in his back-up play­ers, he made only two of five pos­si­ble sub­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has gone back to his favoured XI,” Neville added. “They’re just not hav­ing the best of nights. Phys­i­cally, they just don’t look any­where near it.”</p>
    <p>Of Sol­sk­jaer’s front five of Fer­nan­des, Pogba, Green­wood, An­thony Mar­tial and Mar­cus Rash­ford, only Rash­ford was re­placed.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to have scor­ers out there,” Sol­sk­jaer said. “We know Bruno, Paul, Ma­son, An­thony, they can cre­ate a goal in any sec­ond.”</p>
    <p>West Ham’s point put them on 38 and en­sured the 15th-placed side are cer­tain to avoid rel­e­ga­tion.</p>
