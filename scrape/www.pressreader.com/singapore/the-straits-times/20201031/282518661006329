    <p>NEW YORK • Solid quar­terly earn­ings from Amer­ica’s big­gest tech firms were not enough to keep in­vestors from sell­ing late on Thurs­day, the lat­est sign that sen­ti­ment is turn­ing against ul­tra-ex­pen­sive dig­i­tal mega­caps.</p>
    <p>Fu­tures on the S&P 500 tum­bled 1 per cent and Nas­daq 100 con­tracts lost more than that as of 6:07pm on Thurs­day in New York. Stocks had re­bounded from the worst sell-off in four months dur­ing the reg­u­lar ses­sion ahead of the slate of mega­cap re­sults on bet­terthan-ex­pected US eco­nomic data.</p>
    <p>The slide fol­lows a red-hot run ear­lier this year that saw the tech gi­ants help haul US eq­ui­ties to new highs amid a ram­pant coro­n­avirus out­break and se­vere eco­nomic down­turn.</p>
    <p>“As we’ve seen in re­ac­tions from some of the earn­ings from th­ese large com­pa­nies even beats are not strong enough to sat­isfy this mar­ket, which I think speaks to how fully val­ued a lot of th­ese stocks are,” said Mr Evan Brown, head of multi-as­set strat­egy at UBS As­set Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The quar­tet of re­ports comes af­ter a wild two days for mega­cap tech. The Nas­daq 100 plunged 3.5 per cent for the big­gest rout in four months on Wed­nes­day be­fore re­bound­ing al­most 2 per cent in Thurs­day’s cash ses­sion.</p>
    <p>While the com­pa­nies con­tinue to de­liver strong earn­ings, in­vestors have turned their fo­cus to whether a slower-grow­ing econ­omy will en­able profit growth that jus­ti­fies sky-high val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Face­book was lit­tle changed even af­ter sales topped es­ti­mates when it warned of con­tin­ued un­cer­tainty due to Covid-19 next year and said it plans to spend heav­ily on em­ploy­ees and new tech­nol­ogy. The so­cial net­work makes up more than 4 per cent of Nas­daq’s hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple re­ported quar­terly re­sults that topped Wall Street es­ti­mates af­ter record sales of Macs and ser­vices made up for a de­layed iPhone 12 launch. But its shares dropped al­most 5 per cent af­ter the firm re­vealed iPhone rev­enue missed the av­er­age of an­a­lysts’ es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon lost more than 1 per cent af­ter it said it planned to spend more than an­a­lysts es­ti­mated re­lated to Covid-19. Other­wise, the on­line re­tailer pro­jected a steep jump in sales in the cur­rent quar­ter, top­ping an­a­lysts’ es­ti­mates, in­di­cat­ing that it ex­pects the surge in on­line shop­ping dur­ing the pan­demic to ex­tend through the hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter also re­ported on Thurs­day and its shares got ham­mered on con­cern about its user growth. Third-quar­ter sales ex­ceeded es­ti­mates and re­sults were boosted by a re­turn of ad­ver­tis­ers who had fled or pulled back from the web­site dur­ing the early stages of the Covid-19 pan­demic. The stock lost 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>Al­pha­bet was a bright spot, ral­ly­ing 8 per cent af­ter it re­turned to growth in the third quar­ter fol­low­ing a de­cline in the pre­vi­ous pe­riod, fu­elled by dig­i­tal ad­ver­tis­ing. The Google par­ent re­ported thirdquar­ter rev­enue, mi­nus the cost of dis­tri­bu­tion deals for its search en­gine, rose 15 per cent to US$38 bil­lion (S$51.9 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>How­ever, the re­sults failed to soothe con­cern that the rally in tech shares has gone too far, too fast. Op­ti­mism that their abil­ity to cater for stay-at-home de­mand would help in­su­late the in­dus­try from a broad profit slump dur­ing the pan­demic has sent their shares up 24 per cent as a group since the start of the year, about 10 times as big as the S&P 500.</p>
    <p>“It tells us that even though th­ese stocks are be­low their late-sum­mer highs, they’re still ex­pen­sive,” said Mr Matt Maley, chief mar­ket strate­gist at Miller Tabak + Co. “So un­less they beat ex­pec­ta­tions in a sig­nif­i­cant way, in­vestors are tak­ing fur­ther prof­its.</p>
    <p>“Who can blame them, given that the cap­i­tal gains tax is go­ing to rise if (Demo­crat Joe) Bi­den wins next week?”</p>
    <p>STILL EX­PEN­SIVE</p>
