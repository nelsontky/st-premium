    <p>NEW YORK • Celebrity en­dorse­ments, ex­change out­ages, rafts of new trad­ing ac­counts – bit­coin ma­nia is back.</p>
    <p>In a flashback to 2017, re­tail traders are pil­ing into cryp­tocur­ren­cies and driv­ing prices back to­wards all-time highs. The num­ber of first-time buy­ers is on course to eclipse that of De­cem­ber 2017, said Is­raeli-Bri­tish firm eToro.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin trades per day this month are 81 per cent greater than for the rest of this year com­bined. And Google searches for Coin­base, the crypto ex­change, reached the high­est level in at least a year, ac­cord­ing to Google Trends.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing like a pre-Thanks­giv­ing bit­coin run,” said Bi­nance.US chief ex­ec­u­tive Cather­ine Co­ley.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin climbed within US$100 (S$134) of its all-time high af­ter sur­pass­ing US$19,000for the first time since 2017.</p>
    <p>It is now up more than 40 per cent this month alone and has more than dou­bled this year.</p>
    <p>The frenzy spread to other crypto coins. Dash surged 28 per cent on Tues­day, and bit­coin cash jumped 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>First-time buy­ers have been flood­ing on­line in­vest­ing apps with or­ders. Providers of dig­i­tal wal­lets and pay­ment apps are also see­ing a big jump in crypto sales.</p>
    <p>Square, the San Fran­cisco-based pay­ments firm, said cus­tomers pur­chased US$1.6 bil­lion worth of bit­coin us­ing its Cash App in the third quar­ter, an 83 per cent jump from the prior pe­riod. Even celebri­ties are jump­ing in. Ac­tress Maisie Wil­liams, who played Arya Stark on Game Of Thrones, bought bit­coin de­spite a snap poll she held on Twit­ter say­ing that she should not. “Thank you for the ad­vice. I bought some any­way,” she tweeted.</p>
    <p>Mr An­toni Trenchev, co-founder and manag­ing part­ner of Nexo in Lon­don, which bills it­self as the world’s big­gest crypto lender, said: “The fear of miss­ing out is slowly kick­ing in. We are only just be­gin­ning to see some of our re­tail clients bor­row­ing against their bit­coin to buy more bit­coin, and that will ul­ti­mately pro­pel the rally well into the US$20,000s and be­yond.”</p>
    <p>Trad­ing in cryp­tocur­rency XRP grew so in­tense overnight that</p>
    <p>Coin­base crashed, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports. That sparked a plunge in the coin af­ter the mas­sive rally took it to a record.</p>
    <p>Coin­base’s of­fi­cial sta­tus page says its web­site is op­er­a­tional, and that an in­ci­dent on Mon­day at 10pm has been re­solved.</p>
    <p>How­ever, more sea­soned mar­ket vet­er­ans re­main wary. The crypto world is no­to­ri­ously opaque, and un­like stocks or bonds, which are rooted in eco­nomic and busi­ness fun­da­men­tals, get­ting a read on what makes bit­coin tick can be im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“When­ever I see main­stream me­dia at­ten­tion like this, that usu­ally leads to a sell-off,” said Mr Kevin Mur­cko, the founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of CoinMetro, an Es­to­ni­abased crypto ex­change.</p>
    <p>“The big fish need to lay off risk, so they open the flood­gates to bring in re­tail guys to dump on. Not sure this is the case this time around, but it seems a bit sus­pect.”</p>
