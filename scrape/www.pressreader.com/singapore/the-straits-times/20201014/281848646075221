    <p>NEW JER­SEY John­son & John­son halted clin­i­cal tri­als of its Covid-19 vac­cine af­ter a par­tic­i­pant fell ill, the sec­ond time that a front run­ner de­vel­oper has paused test­ing in the race to cre­ate a vi­able im­mu­ni­sa­tion against the virus.</p>
    <p>The par­tic­i­pant’s ill­ness is be­ing eval­u­ated, the New Jer­sey-based com­pany said l ate on Mon­day, adding that it would share in­for­ma­tion af­ter fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>J&J shares fell 2.4 per cent in trad­ing be­fore US ex­changes opened yesterday. The vac­cine is un­der­go­ing tests in as many as 60,000 vol­un­teers from Peru to South Africa.</p>
    <p>J&J is rac­ing along­side ri­vals like</p>
    <p>Moderna, Pfizer and As­traZeneca to de­liver a shot to help blunt the pan­demic. Drug­mak­ers must bal­ance time pres­sures – es­pe­cially as Covid-19 cases set new records – with safety con­sid­er­a­tions in the cru­cial last stage of test­ing.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to have to get used to hear­ing these sorts of re­ports of pauses,” Prof Has­san Vally, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor in epi­demi­ol­ogy at La Trobe Univer­sity in Mel­bourne, said.</p>
    <p>“As you vac­ci­nate more peo­ple in these tri­als, the chances are that there will be some ill­nesses in par­tic­i­pants. The only dif­fer­ence here is that in the world that we live in right now, the progress of these tri­als are in the pub­lic eye, and so we are rid­ing ev­ery bump.”</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca last month tem­po­rar­ily stopped tests of its own vac­cine candidate af­ter a trial par­tic­i­pant fell ill. That study has re­sumed in some coun­tries, but re­mains halted in the United States.</p>
    <p>While such pauses are rou­tine in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try, J&J’s in­ter­rup­tion may con­trib­ute to con­cerns over safety with vac­cine re­search pro­gress­ing at an un­prece­dented pace. De­vel­op­men­tal pro­cesses that usu­ally take years have been com­pressed into months, egged on by politi­cians want­ing a so­lu­tion to a pan­demic that has killed over one mil­lion peo­ple and scup­pered eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>“We are com­mit­ted to pro­vid­ing trans­par­ent up­dates,” J&J said. “Ad­verse events – ill­nesses, ac­ci­dents, et cetera – even those that are se­ri­ous, are an ex­pected part of any clin­i­cal study, es­pe­cially large stud­ies.”</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, of­fi­cials have sought to dampen ex­pec­ta­tions for a quick fix. Euro­pean Medicines Agency ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Guido Rasi said last week that a vac­cine was look­ing un­likely by year end.</p>
    <p>The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion plans to de­mand two months of safety data be­fore re­view­ing any ap­pli­ca­tion and said any shot sub­mit­ted will need to be eval­u­ated by an in­de­pen­dent panel.</p>
    <p>The pause “is good news in that it demon­strates that the reg­u­la­tory safe­guards to pro­tect the pub­lic are still in place”, said Pro­fes­sor Michael Kinch, a vac­cine spe­cial­ist at Washington Univer­sity in St Louis. He said more in­for­ma­tion was needed to de­ter­mine if the is­sues with J&J’s vac­cine are re­lated to the ill­ness ex­pe­ri­enced by As­traZeneca’s trial par­tic­i­pant.</p>
    <p>J&J chief ex­ec­u­tive Alex Gorsky joked in an in­ter­view ear­lier this month that he was asked “al­most ev­ery 15 min­utes” when a vac­cine will be avail­able. At the time, he reaf­firmed J&J’s ex­pec­ta­tion that by “late this year, early next year”, the firm could be­gin re­views with reg­u­la­tors for pos­si­ble emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion. That time­line may now be in ques­tion.</p>
    <p>IN THE PUB­LIC EYE As you vac­ci­nate more peo­ple in these tri­als, the chances are that there will be some ill­nesses in par­tic­i­pants. The only dif­fer­ence here is that in the world that we live in right now, the progress of these tri­als are in the pub­lic eye, and so we are rid­ing ev­ery bump.</p>
