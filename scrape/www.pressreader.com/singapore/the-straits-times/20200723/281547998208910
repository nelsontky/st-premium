    <p>China has evac­u­ated thou­sands of res­i­dents after a land­slide blocked a river and cre­ated a bar­rier lake that threat­ened to sub­merge neigh­bour­ing vil­lages, as large parts of the coun­try reeled un­der some of the heav­i­est rain­fall in decades. The land­slide oc­curred as earth fell into a trib­u­tary of the Yangtze River near En­shi city in Hubei prov­ince.</p>
    <p>BEI­JING • China has evac­u­ated thou­sands of res­i­dents after a land­slide blocked a river and cre­ated a bar­rier lake that threat­ened to sub­merge neigh­bour­ing vil­lages, as large parts of the coun­try reeled un­der some of the heav­i­est rain­fall in decades.</p>
    <p>The land­slide oc­curred on Tues­day as 1.5 mil­lion cu­bic m of earth fell into a trib­u­tary of the Yangtze River near En­shi city in Hubei prov­ince, Xin­hua news agency said, cit­ing lo­cal flood con­trol au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Cen­tre yesterday re­newed a yel­low alert for rain­storms in Shan­dong, He­nan, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Chongqing, Sichuan, Yun­nan and Ti­bet as fresh rounds of tor­ren­tial rain threaten to raise flood risks across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre warned that some ar­eas of Shan­dong will ex­pe­ri­ence heavy rain with up to 180mm of daily rain­fall, and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties are ad­vised to halt out­door op­er­a­tions in flood-prone ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Red alerts have been de­clared in the prov­inces of An­hui and Jiangxi, which are bi­sected by the Yangtze.</p>
    <p>China’s Wa­ter Re­sources Min­istry warned on Tues­day that wa­ter lev­els in the Yangtze and ad­join­ing lakes would con­tinue to rise.</p>
    <p>Min­istry of­fi­cials said they needed to keep a close eye on wa­ter lev­els at the Three Gorges Dam, which has been stor­ing huge vol­umes of wa­ter to ease down­stream flood risks, and is now 16m higher than its of­fi­cial warn­ing level.</p>
    <p>China’s gi­ant dams, de­signed to con­tain floods and gen­er­ate elec­tric­ity, have come un­der heavy scru­tiny in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>While of­fi­cials have talked up their role in re­duc­ing flood peaks, critics say they not only fail to pro­tect against ex­treme weather but also cut flood stor­age ca­pac­ity. For ex­am­ple, a dam at a small reser­voir in the Guangxi re­gion gave way last month after days of heavy rain.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated in Yangshuo county, the dam col­lapsed at around mid­day on June 7, in­un­dat­ing roads, or­chards and fields in Shaz­ixi vil­lage, res­i­dents told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never seen such flood­ing,” said vil­lager Luo Qiyuan, 81, who helped build the dam decades ago.</p>
    <p>“The wa­ter lev­els were never so high in pre­vi­ous years, and the dam had never col­lapsed.”</p>
    <p>Com­pleted in 1965, the dam, made of com­pacted earth, was de­signed to hold 195,000 cu­bic m of wa­ter, enough to fill 78 Olympic­size swim­ming pools and meet the ir­ri­ga­tion needs of Shaz­ixi’s farm­ers.</p>
    <p>On a visit to the reser­voir this month, Reuters found that the length of the dam – about 100m – had largely van­ished. It had been re­in­forced 25 years ago.</p>
    <p>The wa­ter went over the dam, which then col­lapsed, said a mem­ber of a sur­vey crew at the reser­voir, de­clin­ing to be iden­ti­fied as he was not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Shaz­ixi res­i­dents said there were no deaths. But the col­lapse, which was not re­ported by the do­mes­tic me­dia, sug­gests big storms might be enough to over­whelm reser­voirs, es­pe­cially if the de­sign is in­fe­rior and main­te­nance has been patchy.</p>
    <p>That raises the prospect of dis­as­ter in river val­leys and flood plains that are much more densely pop­u­lated than they were when the dams were built.</p>
    <p>Dams also block the flow of sed­i­ment and re­duce the abil­ity of wet­lands to ab­sorb flood wa­ters, said Pro­fes­sor Dar­rin Magee from the Ho­bart and Wil­liam Smith Col­leges in New York who spe­cialises in China’s wa­ter is­sues. The need to gen­er­ate power can also un­der­mine flood con­trol ef­forts, he added.</p>
    <p>“Flood con­trol re­quires re­tain­ing wa­ter, and power pro­duc­tion re­quires let­ting it out,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Agri­cul­ture and Ru­ral Af­fairs on Mon­day said it has al­lo­cated a 330 mil­lion yuan (S$65.3 mil­lion) dis­as­ter re­lief fund to help farm­ers and agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion in south­ern prov­inces, in­clud­ing Jiangsu, An­hui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hu­nan, Guangxi and Sichuan.</p>
    <p>The fund would help farm­ers re­sume pro­duc­tion after the dis­as­ter and re­pair dam­aged agri­cul­tural fa­cil­i­ties, which will in turn re­duce the loss of farm in­come.</p>
