    <p>Res­o­lu­tion of the cur­rent de­bate about jobs for Sin­ga­porean ver­sus for­eign pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) re­quires ex­plicit recog­ni­tion that the needs and in­ter­ests of busi­ness, the econ­omy and the na­tion are not, and will never be, per­fectly aligned – here or any­where else in the world.</p>
    <p>Hence, choices will in­evitably have to be made be­tween al­ter­na­tive poli­cies that en­tail dif­fer­ent costs and ben­e­fits for dif­fer­ent en­ti­ties, groups and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>As a US-based aca­demic spe­cial­is­ing in eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, I have stud­ied the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy and its labour mar­kets for over 40 years. I taught in­ter­na­tional eco­nom­ics (trade, investment and ex­change rates) and global cor­po­rate strat­egy to Master of Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion stu­dents and busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives from around the world (most re­cently, China), and served for 16 years as an in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor on the boards of two Nas­daq-listed</p>
    <p>United States pub­lic com­pa­nies with ex­ten­sive in­ter­na­tional oper­a­tions in tech man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>CON­FLICT­ING IN­TER­ESTS</p>
    <p>Each of these roles had a clearly de­fined set of re­spon­si­bil­i­ties which over­lapped but were not iden­ti­cal, and could con­flict with one an­other.</p>
    <p>In­deed, at my univer­sity, we are re­quired to reg­u­larly dis­close any po­ten­tial or ac­tual con­flicts of in­ter­est be­tween our re­search, teach­ing and ex­ter­nal pro­fes­sional ac­tiv­i­ties like con­sult­ing and board ser­vice. Sim­i­lar as­sur­ances were re­quired in an­nual dec­la­ra­tions for my cor­po­rate boards.</p>
    <p>Take the ex­am­ple of “investment in­cen­tives” of­fered by host gov­ern­ments. In the eco­nom­ics class­room I taught that the ra­tio­nale for these is the ex­is­tence of “mar­ket im­per­fec­tions” that make a par­tic­u­lar lo­ca­tion other­wise unattrac­tive to profit-seek­ing in­vestors, be­cause of higher costs and risks, or a smaller mar­ket, than are avail­able else­where.</p>
    <p>Sub­si­dies to in­vestors to com­pen­sate for these mar­ket de­fi­cien­cies are more likely to be needed in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, as my re­search on for­eign investment</p>
    <p>and industrial­isation in Asia doc­u­mented in con­sul­tant re­ports for in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment agen­cies such as the United Na­tions and the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Sub­si­dies are also more likely to be re­quired by for­eign en­ter­prises pre­sumed to be both “foot­loose” and lack­ing in the “home-court ad­van­tages” en­joyed by do­mes­tic com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>Economists ex­pect host coun­tries to ben­e­fit from the in­jec­tion of scarce re­sources (cap­i­tal, skills, tech­nol­ogy) by for­eign in­vestors, en­abling higher growth rates, lo­cal em­ploy­ment cre­ation, skills and tech­nol­ogy trans­fer, and back­ward and for­ward link­ages with lo­cal en­ter­prises that would more than pay for the sub­si­dies pro­vided. This was what I found in my re­search on the elec­tron­ics in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore from the 1970s to the 1990s.</p>
    <p>In the busi­ness class­room, investment in­cen­tives (such as tax breaks, re­search and de­vel­op­ment and train­ing grants, and in­fra­struc­ture sub­si­dies) are pre­sented as el­e­ments of “non-mar­ket strat­egy” that in­vest­ing firms could and should de­mand of host gov­ern­ments in</p>
    <p>ex­change for their investment, with the goal of re­duc­ing risk and in­creas­ing the rate of re­turn</p>
    <p>(profit) to the in­vest­ing com­pany’s share­hold­ers (who, in the case of multi­na­tion­als, would be for­eign­ers).</p>
    <p>On my cor­po­rate boards, there were a few oc­ca­sions in the 2000s and 2010s when new investment in Sin­ga­pore was con­sid­ered, and “ask the EDB (Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board) for in­cen­tives” was al­ready de rigueur for po­ten­tial in­vestors. In­cen­tives, of course, come with cer­tain “per­for­mance re­quire­ments”, such as the amount of cap­i­tal to be in­vested and the num­ber of jobs cre­ated lo­cally. But com­pa­nies have many ways to meet these min­i­mally and, in the short term, to qual­ify by the letter, not al­ways spirit, of the re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>As an econ­o­mist, and par­tic­u­larly as a Sin­ga­porean, I was some­times con­cerned about the long-term ben­e­fits to the host econ­omy, and the op­por­tu­nity costs of the state re­sources ex­pended on pro­vid­ing such sub­si­dies, es­pe­cially to a for­eign cor­po­ra­tion. But as a board mem­ber of that cor­po­ra­tion, I had a sin­gle fidu­ciary obli­ga­tion, to max­imise value to the (mostly for­eign) share­holder.</p>
    <p>Both the com­pa­nies whose boards I served on even­tu­ally left Sin­ga­pore, and while they were here, most of their em­ploy­ees, in­clud­ing se­nior man­age­ment and tech­ni­cal staff, were per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) or Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) and S Pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>What has this got to do with the cur­rent PMET jobs de­bate?</p>
    <p>Most ob­vi­ously, the in­ter­ests of dif­fer­ent par­ties dif­fer, as they must.</p>
    <p>In the cur­rent global mar­ket en­vi­ron­ment, notwith­stand­ing pre-pan­demic prom­ises to pay more at­ten­tion to “stake­hold­ers” (em­ploy­ees, con­sumers, sup­pli­ers, host com­mu­ni­ties, govern­ment), cap­i­tal­ist busi­nesses must pri­ori­tise the in­ter­ests of their share­hold­ers (the cap­i­tal own­ers). Host govern­ment poli­cies that might in­crease costs, how­ever marginally (like the EP and S Pass salary thresh­olds be­ing raised), must be re­sisted.</p>
    <p>Nat­u­rally, for­eign PMETs will also op­pose this pol­icy, as will their em­ploy­ers, for­eign or lo­cal.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal PMETs may be ex­pected to ben­e­fit, at least at the mar­gins, though some may also lose their jobs if their em­ploy­ers shut down – an out­come which, if re­sult­ing from the salary-in­crease pol­icy alone, sug­gests they are not very com­pet­i­tive in Sin­ga­pore to be­gin with, and post-pan­demic, may have been kept afloat only by govern­ment sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>With­out de­tailed data, and given the huge eco­nomic un­cer­tainty in the short to medium term, it is im­pos­si­ble to de­ter­mine how many lo­cal PMET jobs will be cre­ated or lost rel­a­tive to for­eign PMET jobs.</p>
    <p>But pol­icy de­ci­sions should not be made on the ba­sis of short-term lo­cal job losses alone. In a mar­ket econ­omy, un­der­utilised re­sources will be re­al­lo­cated, and in a post-Covid-19 world, in ways we may not be able to fore­see for some time.</p>
    <p>We do know from the cur­rent de­bate, and from the ex­pe­ri­ence of the past 20 years, that Sin­ga­pore is chron­i­cally short of labour and tal­ent. Our past eco­nomic model of ex­treme de­pen­dence on for­eign labour and skills is al­ready yield­ing di­min­ish­ing mar­ginal re­turns (in terms of pro­duc­tiv­ity, growth, lo­cal jobs and in­comes), and is un­likely to be sus­tain­able in the medium, let alone long term.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness and the econ­omy are not the same thing, so the in­ter­ests of par­tic­u­lar busi­nesses and the na­tional econ­omy will also not be the same.</p>
    <p>For busi­ness, be­ing able to hire any­one from any­where in the world with ease of get­ting a work visa and PR sta­tus al­lows for flex­i­bil­ity (in­clud­ing in re­lo­cat­ing an em­ployee glob­ally if busi­ness cir­cum­stances change). It re­duces the need and cost of hav­ing to train and re­tain lo­cals, who add lit­tle value, es­pe­cially to pro­fes­sional ser­vice busi­nesses ori­ented to a global mar­ket where a “home-court ad­van­tage” is not re­quired.</p>
    <p>But for the na­tional econ­omy, de­vel­op­ing lo­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties is crit­i­cal for long-term sur­vival, and as the pan­demic has shown, even for short-term busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity as a risk-min­imis­ing con­tin­gency (or “re­dun­dancy”).</p>
    <p>A smaller or slower-grow­ing econ­omy, with a higher share of em­ploy­ment, skills, in­come, con­sump­tion and investment ac­cru­ing to or un­der­taken by lo­cals, could de­liver a higher de­gree of eco­nomic wel­fare to Sin­ga­pore­ans. It could also re­duce the need for con­tin­u­ally ex­pand­ing tax­payer-funded so­cial sub­si­dies to com­pen­sate for in­ad­e­quate “mar­ket” wages de­pressed by the con­tin­u­ally ex­pand­ing sup­ply of for­eign labour and tal­ent (a de facto sub­sidy for em­ploy­ers and share­hold­ers).</p>
    <p>BE­YOND DOL­LARS AND CENTS</p>
    <p>But the na­tional in­ter­est en­com­passes more than the econ­omy, and in­cludes so­cial, cul­tural, po­lit­i­cal, dis­tri­bu­tional, en­vi­ron­men­tal, emo­tional and iden­tity com­po­nents, all of which are af­fected (in this case) by a large tran­sient work­force.</p>
    <p>This is why busi­ness does not, and should not, run any na­tion, and why we have gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>It is the job of the govern­ment to bal­ance the costs and ben­e­fits to dif­fer­ent groups and make trade-offs be­tween com­pet­ing in­ter­ests (such as be­tween for­eign busi­ness and lo­cal PMETs; rental prop­erty own­ers and young fam­i­lies seek­ing af­ford­able hous­ing; con­sumers and sub­sidy-pro­vid­ing tax­pay­ers), and to weigh eco­nomic and non-eco­nomic con­sid­er­a­tions, to achieve an equi­lib­rium that pri­ori­tises the over­all well-be­ing, val­ues and wishes of cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>In this bal­anc­ing act, it is un­help­ful to pi­geon­hole dif­fer­ent voices and pit peo­ple against one an­other as ei­ther “glob­al­ist” or “na­tivist”, with only the na­tivists cas­ti­gated for be­ing di­vi­sive. Even a life­long pro­fes­sional glob­al­ist like my­self must recog­nise that glob­al­ism and the govern­ment poli­cies that feed it do not de­liver equal or eq­ui­table con­se­quences for all sec­tors of the na­tional econ­omy and all seg­ments of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, be­ing “open”, as Sin­ga­pore­ans pride our­selves on be­ing, does not mean un­fet­tered open­ness is an un­al­loyed good and the best strat­egy for all par­ties, times and places, in­clud­ing be­ing al­ways open to ev­ery busi­ness and ev­ery worker of ev­ery na­tion­al­ity. That would be an­swer­ing to ide­ol­ogy, not the prag­ma­tism on which we also pride our­selves.</p>
    <p>The prag­matic and best pol­icy so­lu­tion economists favour – the “tax­ing of win­ners to com­pen­sate losers” – does not rely on a na­tional or na­tion­al­ist, much less “na­tivist” per­spec­tive. It sim­ply mir­rors the “investment in­cen­tives” that tra­di­tion­ally com­pen­sate for­eign cap­i­tal for the mar­ket de­fi­cien­cies of a par­tic­u­lar host lo­ca­tion – which, for lo­cal labour, is their home.</p>
