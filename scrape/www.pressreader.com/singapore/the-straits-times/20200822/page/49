        life home and garden C3 THE STRAITS TIMES SATURDAY, AUGUST 22, 2020 | | | Five Singapore landmarks by Swan & Maclaren 1 Raffles Hotel (1897 to 1899) Raffles Hotel is probably Swan & Maclaren’s most famous and iconic work, recognised globally and a symbol of Singapore during the colonial era.
In 1897, the firm received a new commission for further additions to the hotel in Beach Road, which included a complete rebuilding of the central core. This was the biggest single improvemen­t that Armenian hoteliers, the Sarkies brothers, who establishe­d the hotel in 1887, had undertaken. It would later result in one of the most iconic buildings in Asia.
The changes were conceived by Regent Alfred Bidwell, one of the firm’s most successful and influentia­l architects, who joined it in 1897 at the age of 26 and later became a partner.
The centre of the old Raffles Hotel Beach House bungalow was gutted and replaced with a new three-storey block with projecting wings at either end, angled at 45 degrees to the main elevation.
The new block served as porte cocheres – porches for coaches – with verandas on the floors above for sitting and taking in panoramic views of the harbour.
This configurat­ion, featuring angled bays, was a popular feature in late-Victorian residentia­l architectu­re, where it was typically referred to as the “butterfly suntrap” plan.
Dr Julian Davison writes in the book: “Trapping the sun was hardly a priority in tropical Singapore, but being open on three sides, the canted bays were advantageo­usly exposed to the slightest zephyr breeze and provided guests with agreeable sitting areas when outside their rooms.” 2 Atbara (1898) Bidwell was also credited with the invention of the black-and-white bungalow, as seen in his 1898 design of Atbara in Gallop Road. Dr Davison writes: “It represente­d a totally new approach to residentia­l architectu­re in Singapore, introducin­g design features that were more in line with contempora­ry architectu­ral fashions in England than had hitherto been seen before in Singapore.” 3 Teutonia Club (1899) The Teutonia Club (now Goodwood Park Hotel) was one of the most unusual designs to come out of the drafting rooms at Swan & Maclaren.
Bidwell departed from his usual late-Victorian freestyle Classicism to take on this Northern Renaissanc­e clubhouse project for the German community in Singapore. Its tower rapidly became a landmark among Singapore’s predominan­tly low-rise structures during the early 1900s.
“The foliate stucco work adorning the facade of the Teutonia Club became something of a signature Bidwell ornament over the next few years,” writes Dr Davison. 4 Victoria Memorial Hall and Theatre (1902 to 1909) The tallest built structure in Singapore in the early 1900s was the Victoria Memorial Hall and Theatre, designed by Bidwell from 1902.
Its main elevation was dominated by a clock tower, rising almost 54m above ground, and was in honour of Queen Victoria, who died on
Jan 22, 1901.
The laying of the foundation stone was carefully timed by the British colonial masters to coincide with the coronation of Queen Victoria’s son,
Edward VII, on the eve of the coronation on Aug 8, 1902.
Initial proposals for the Memorial Hall met with a lukewarm response – it was felt that the funds might be better spent elsewhere.
Co-founder of Swan & Maclaren James Waddell Boyd Maclaren, a member of the building committee, submitted alternativ­e plans, which included a theatre and a new town hall. The revised scheme was approved, Bidwell’s plans were submitted and the project went ahead.
The Memorial Hall was completed in 1903 and the theatre in 1909. 5 Gujarat and other parts of South Asia as well as Arabs, who were mainly from Yemen.
Swan & Maclaren architect Denis Santry’s visualisat­ion of Sultan Mosque represents the best surviving example of Indo-Saracenic architectu­re to be found in Singapore.
The elevations, writes Dr Davison, “present an eclectic mix of elements, dominated by a pair of Moghul onion domes, flanked by ‘chhatri’ pavilions, Moghul minarets and finials, Moorish trefoil arches and ogee window heads”. Beef Up Your Finances Masjid Sultan (1924) The congregati­on in the Sultan Mosque during the 1920s comprised not only Malays and Arabs from Singapore and Johor, but also co-religionis­ts from across the Malay world, such as the Bugis from Sulawesi, the Boyanese from Pulau Bawean and the Palembang Malays from south Sumatra.
