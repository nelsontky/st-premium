    <p>A for­mer teacher was sen­tenced to six weeks’ jail yes­ter­day for record­ing up­skirt videos of women, in­clud­ing two 17-year-olds.</p>
    <p>Daniel Chen Junyi, 29, pleaded guilty in Au­gust to two counts of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty.</p>
    <p>Two other sim­i­lar charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by Dis­trict Judge Adam Nakhoda dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>His vic­tims can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect their iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments did not state the school Chen taught at but The Straits Times un­der­stands that he was em­ployed by an in­ter­na­tional school at the time of his of­fences.</p>
    <p>On Jan 11, 2018, Chen tar­geted a 17-year-old while on the way to his girl­friend’s home.</p>
    <p>While in the lift with the vic­tim and her sis­ter, Chen pressed the but­ton for the high­est floor in the build­ing, even though his girl­friend lived on the fourth storey.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing be­hind the two girls, he placed his mo­bile phone un­der­neath his vic­tim’s skirt and recorded a video.</p>
    <p>He with­drew his phone af­ter the vic­tim’s sis­ter no­ticed his move­ment and turned to look at him.</p>
    <p>Chen later ex­ited the lift at the top floor and watched the video be­fore head­ing to his girl­friend’s flat.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim’s sis­ter called the po­lice and Chen was ar­rested eight days later.</p>
    <p>But even with the first case hang­ing over him, Chen struck again on Sept 25 last year. This time, he was ac­com­pa­ny­ing his girl­friend to shop at a store.</p>
    <p>He ap­proached a 17-year-old staff mem­ber from be­hind and recorded a video un­der­neath her dress.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that his ac­tions were cap­tured on closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­eras.</p>
    <p>The staff mem­ber, who had no­ticed Chen stand­ing close be­hind her, made a po­lice re­port. He was ar­rested five days later.</p>
    <p>Chen’s lawyers Ravin­der­pal Singh and James Ow Yong said in their mit­i­ga­tion plea that their client had re­sumed psy­chother­apy ses­sions for his be­hav­iour and even ap­plied a su­per­glue sticker to cover the cam­era of his mo­bile phone.</p>
    <p>For each of­fence of in­sult­ing a woman’s mod­esty, Chen could have been jailed for up to a year and fined.</p>
