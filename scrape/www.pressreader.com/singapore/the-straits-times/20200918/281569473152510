    <p>In a verdict that brings to a close a rare le­gal case that has seen twists and turns in the past nine years, a 34-year-old Nige­rian man was ac­quit­ted of a cap­i­tal drug traf­fick­ing charge af­ter the Court of Ap­peal re­versed its 2015 de­ci­sion to con­vict him.</p>
    <p>In a verdict that brings to a close a rare le­gal case that has seen twists and turns in the past nine years, a 34-year-old Nige­rian man was ac­quit­ted of a cap­i­tal drug traf­fick­ing charge af­ter the Court of Ap­peal re­versed its 2015 de­ci­sion to con­vict him.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a 4-1 split de­ci­sion, a five-judge panel ruled yes­ter­day that the past judg­ment can no longer stand af­ter new ev­i­dence sur­faced that Mr Ilechukwu Uchechukwu Chuk­wudi was suf­fer­ing from post-trau­matic stress symp­toms (PTSS) when he lied to nar­cotics of­fi­cers in 2011.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity – com­pris­ing Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, Judges of Ap­peal An­drew Phang and Ju­dith Prakash, and Se­nior Judge Chao Hick Tin – con­cluded that the 2015 de­ci­sion was “demon­stra­bly wrong”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ilechukwu ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from Nige­ria on Nov 13, 2011, bring­ing along a black suit­case.</p>
    <p>He passed it to Sin­ga­porean Hami­dah Awang, who was then ar­rested at Wood­lands Check­point af­ter nearly 2kg of metham­phetamine was found in­side.</p>
    <p>Mr Ilechukwu was ar­rested in his ho­tel room the next morn­ing.</p>
    <p>He was orig­i­nally ac­quit­ted by the High Court in 2014 af­ter the judge ac­cepted his tes­ti­mony that he did not know the suit­case con­tained drugs.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion ap­pealed to a three-judge Court of Ap­peal, which over­turned the ac­quit­tal and con­victed him.</p>
    <p>What tipped the scales at the time were the many lies told by Mr Ilechukwu in his state­ments, which the apex court con­cluded could only be ex­plained by “his re­al­i­sa­tion of his guilt”.</p>
    <p>In 2017, lawyers for the Nige­rian suc­ceeded in get­ting the apex court to re­open the case.</p>
    <p>This was af­ter an In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH) re­port, pre­pared by the pros­e­cu­tion for sen­tenc­ing, stated that Mr Ilechukwu suf­fered from post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der (PTSD) af­ter wit­ness­ing a mas­sacre when he was five years old.</p>
    <p>The case was sent back to the High Court for a hear­ing in which three psy­chi­a­trists for the de­fence and one for the pros­e­cu­tion gave their ex­pert opin­ions on PTSD.</p>
    <p>In its judg­ment yes­ter­day, the ma­jor­ity said there is now a plau­si­ble in­no­cent ex­pla­na­tion for the lies.</p>
    <p>The apex court ac­cepted that Mr Ilechukwu’s his­tory of PTSD and his PTSS in 2011 “may have led him to grossly over­es­ti­mate the threat on his life” and that “this may in turn have prompted the ap­pli­cant to ut­ter the un­so­phis­ti­cated and bla­tant false­hoods in his state­ments in an at­tempt to es­cape from the death penalty and to save his life”.</p>
    <p>If this ev­i­dence had been be­fore the apex court in 2015, “the out­come would have been dif­fer­ent”, said the ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>In his dis­sent­ing judg­ment, Judge of Ap­peal Tay Yong Kwang said he did not think that the new ev­i­dence re­vealed any er­ror in the pre­vi­ous de­ci­sion to con­vict the Nige­rian.</p>
    <p>“I sym­pa­thise with the ap­pli­cant for his past suf­fer­ing in re­spect of what­ever hor­rors he had wit­nessed in his home­land, es­pe­cially as a young boy.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, in the fi­nal anal­y­sis of all the ev­i­dence here, the ap­pli­cant’s de­fence was truly a highly un­likely ac­count from a to­tally un­re­li­able and un­truth­ful source,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ilechukwu’s le­gal team – Mr Eu­gene Thu­raisingam, Mr Suang Wi­jaya, Mr Jo­hannes Hadi and Ms Jer­rie Tan – said in a state­ment: “It has been a long and hard-fought pro bono case, in­volv­ing spe­cial­ist psy­chi­atric ev­i­dence and is­sues of cross-cul­tural sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Had it not been for the for­tu­itous pro­duc­tion of the IMH re­port, our client would have been sen­tenced to death or life im­pris­on­ment.”</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that the Nige­rian em­bassy is ar­rang­ing for Mr Ilechukwu, who has been in cus­tody since his ar­rest, to de­part for La­gos on the next avail­able flight.</p>
