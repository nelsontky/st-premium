    <p>This is what more than $4 mil­lion worth of gold looks like.</p>
    <p>In all, these two stacks of pure gold bul­lion com­prise 50 pieces, each smaller than the palm of your hand but weigh­ing a hefty 1kg.</p>
    <p>To­gether, they weigh more than a pe­tite adult woman.</p>
    <p>If you are won­der­ing whether you are worth your weight in gold, the value of each bar, based on the cur­rent price, is over $80,000.</p>
    <p>These gold bars and many oth­ers are be­ing stored i n Le Freeport, a se­cured lo­gis­tics hub in Changi North Cres­cent.</p>
    <p>In case you are har­bour­ing thoughts of a gold heist, don’t bother.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate max­i­mum-se­cu­rity vault, touted as Asia’s Fort Knox, is pro­tected round the clock by armed guards.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors to the vault have to go through checks that are stricter than at the air­port.</p>
    <p>Be­fore en­ter­ing and leav­ing, they must step into a se­cu­rity scan­ner and lift up both arms for a com­plete body scan to en­sure no one can smug­gle any­thing in or out.</p>
    <p>Within this high-se­cu­rity zone is where the Sin­ga­pore Pre­cious Met­als Ex­change (SGPMX), a unique pri­vately run trad­ing and stor­age com­pany un­like your usual gold trader, op­er­ates.</p>
    <p>The com­pany al­lows in­vestors – both big and small – to trade in ac­tual gold in an on­line global ex­change where anony­mous buy­ers and sell­ers deal with each other, much like how shares are traded on the stock ex­change.</p>
    <p>This type of gold trad­ing is pos­si­bly the first of its kind, as in­vestors who want to bet on gold will usu­ally put their money in gold ex­change-traded funds (ETFs).</p>
    <p>In such cases, any money made or lost is based on the per­for­mance of the funds, which try to make the best trades based on the volatil­ity of gold prices, so in­vestors do not re­ally own gold in such cases.</p>
    <p>A more tra­di­tional way of in­vest­ing in gold, of­ten pre­ferred by the older gen­er­a­tion, is to buy gold bars, coins and jew­ellery, which they keep at home or in safe de­posit boxes.</p>
    <p>They will then sell these items to gold­smiths or pawn­shops if they need to con­vert them to cash.</p>
    <p>While some peo­ple may scoff at what se­niors do with their gold, Mr Vic­tor Foo, found­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of SGPMX, notes that there are mer­its in this old-school prac­tice.</p>
    <p>“Trad­ing in phys­i­cal gold in to­day’s on­line world may seem out of fash­ion, but know that as long as you have that gold, you will never lose the value.</p>
    <p>“I learnt this the hard way in 2008 when well-known in­sti­tu­tions like Lehman Broth­ers went down.</p>
    <p>“All the money I had with them was also gone,” says Mr Foo, who was then an insurance bro­ker.</p>
    <p>This is why gold is al­ways seen as a safe as­set in a down­turn, such as the cur­rent pandemic which has caused gold prices to rise by more than 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing on his ex­pe­ri­ence and tap­ping in­vestor sen­ti­ment, Mr</p>
    <p>Foo founded SGPMX, which in­cor­po­rates all the best prac­tices of gold in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>In the past decade, SGPMX has al­lowed gold in­vestors in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas to trade with one an­other on­line, with gold bul­lion that comes di­rectly from wel­l­known re­finer­ies around the world.</p>
    <p>Be­ing in a high-se­cu­rity zone next to Changi Air­port fa­cil­i­tates the di­rect move­ment of high­value car­goes be­tween the vault and the planes.</p>
    <p>In­vestors can buy gold at mar­ket price from SGPMX and pay fees that range from 0.25 per cent to 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the fee for a $10,000 trade costs $25 and the fee for stor­ing a 1kg gold bar is about $300 to $400 a year, de­pend­ing on the cur­rent price of gold.</p>
    <p>Those who are keen to keep a per­sonal stash can also rent de­posit boxes or even a gi­ant safe that can hold up to three tonnes of gold.</p>
    <p>So, how much gold is stored there, and how many cus­tomers do the bars be­long to?</p>
    <p>“For con­fi­den­tial­ity and insurance li­a­bil­ity rea­sons, these are the two ques­tions that I can­not an­swer,” says Mr Foo.</p>
    <p>He was in­ter­viewed and pho­tographed in his pri­vate of­fice in the build­ing, be­cause film­ing is not al­lowed in the vault.</p>
    <p>PER­SONAL RE­SERVES FOR FAM­I­LIES</p>
    <p>Just like how coun­tries keep gold as na­tional re­serves to boost and defend their economies, some well-off fam­i­lies can main­tain pri­vate gold re­serves to guard against se­vere down­turns.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment here en­sures that each bank cus­tomer is pro­tected up to $75,000 per bank.</p>
    <p>“But if you have a lot of money in the bank, this may not be suf­fi­cient pro­tec­tion and hence some peo­ple turn to gold as the as­set to pre­serve their wealth,” Mr Foo says.</p>
    <p>Gold bars from well-known re­finer­ies come in the fol­low­ing com­mon sizes: 1g, 5g, 10g, 50g, 100g and 1kg.</p>
    <p>While smaller bars al­low more flex­i­bil­ity for own­ers in cash­ing them in, the most pop­u­lar bul­lion is the big­gest one be­cause most peo­ple keep gold for the long term.</p>
    <p>SGPMX also has a trad­ing scheme that al­lows own­ers of 1kg bul­lion to “sell” only a part of their bul­lion, with­out cut­ting it phys­i­cally. This comes as some own­ers wish to cash in on their gold with­out hav­ing to sell the en­tire bar.</p>
    <p>In such cases, SGPMX will update the “gold ac­counts” of their cus­tomers, who can check on­line how much gold they still have.</p>
    <p>IS GOLD IN­VEST­MENT WORTH THE MONEY?</p>
    <p>If you had the fore­sight to put all your money into gold ear­lier this year be­fore the Covid-19 out­break was de­clared a pandemic, you would be richer by about 25 per cent to­day.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the price of gold surged and hit record highs in the last few months be­cause de­mand ex­ceeded sup­ply, spark­ing a mod­ern­day gold rush. It cur­rently stands at $81,828 per kg.</p>
    <p>But if you are new to this game, know that gold, un­like shares of blue-chip com­pa­nies, does not give you div­i­dend in­come as you hold on to it. You make money only when you sell it at a higher price, or lose money if you sell it be­low your pur­chase price.</p>
    <p>If you are not con­fi­dent in trad­ing in gold but are still keen to do so, you can con­sider in­vest­ing in a “proxy”, which is a gold ETF that is man­aged by in­vest­ment firms.</p>
    <p>Not all gold ETFs are cre­ated equal, so do your home­work be­fore you buy into one.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, your par­ents may tell you that buy­ing gold jew­ellery is not the same as buy­ing bul­lion.</p>
    <p>You pay more for jew­ellery as there are work­man­ship fees and it is un­likely to be pure gold (24K), which is too soft to hold its shape.</p>
    <p>When it comes to in­vest­ing in gold, bul­lion is a bet­ter choice than pure gold coins.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some com­mem­o­ra­tive coins have an in­tan­gi­ble ad­van­tage if they are rare, as there will be col­lec­tors who are will­ing to pay a lot more than their worth in gold.</p>
    <p>In the past, some Sin­ga­pore­ans were duped by crooked gold traders who ran off with their gold and money.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo is aware of such cases, so he has cho­sen a high-se­cu­rity zone sub­ject to var­i­ous checks and rules from the au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms.</p>
    <p>More­over, only the own­ers have keys to their safes, and they can check on their gold any time.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially we were wor­ried that some peo­ple would come reg­u­larly to see their gold, so we al­low only six free vis­its per year be­cause guards need to be de­ployed for each visit.</p>
    <p>“But so far, no one has come more than six times a year.”</p>
