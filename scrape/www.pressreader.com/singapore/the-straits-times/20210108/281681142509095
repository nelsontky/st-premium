    <p>Sin­ga­pore lead­ers have ex­pressed shock at the vi­o­lence that has bro­ken out in the United States, af­ter sup­port­ers of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump stormed the US Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Se­nior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean said he hoped the events in the US on Wed­nes­day after­noon (early yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore time) would come to a peace­ful end.</p>
    <p>“(I) have been up, watch­ing shock­ing scenes i n the US Congress where pro­test­ers have en­tered the cham­ber, stopped pro­ceed­ings and forced mem­bers to flee... We hope this ends peace­fully. It is a sad day,” he wrote on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin said on Face­book that the events which had tran­spired in Wash­ing­ton were “un­be­liev­able”, and added that he hoped for the sit­u­a­tion to sta­bilise, and for peace and order to pre­vail. “There is al­ways due process, and the rule of law needs to be re­spected. When in­di­vid­u­als and groups de­cide to take the law into their own hands, it will es­sen­tially be mob jus­tice...</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery so­ci­ety is sub­ject to the same dy­nam­ics and pres­sures. We all need to re­flect on how we wish to ap­proach this dis­course in our re­spec­tive so­ci­eties.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) ad­vised Sin­ga­pore­ans in the US to re­main vig­i­lant, mon­i­tor the lo­cal news closely and fol­low the ad­vice of the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans should also take the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions for their per­sonal safety, and avoid ar­eas where demon­stra­tions are oc­cur­ring, it said in a state­ment. They are also strongly en­cour­aged to eRegis­ter with MFA.</p>
