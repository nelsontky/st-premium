    <p>New doc­u­men­tary about the chart­top­ping K-pop girl group sees the mem­bers open­ing up about their jour­ney to fame</p>
    <p>The most mem­o­rable mo­ment for Blackpink mem­ber Rose while film­ing their doc­u­men­tary was hang­ing out with her band­mates and watching old footage of the quar­tet from be­fore the K-pop girl group be­came a chart-top­ping global sen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>New Zealand-born Rose, 23, says at a press con­fer­ence live-streamed from Seoul on Tues­day: “When we were look­ing at all our old footage to­gether – those from our child­hood and clips of us still as trainees – that was the most mem­o­rable. It was four of us just talk­ing about sto­ries we had from those times and teas­ing each other a lot.”</p>
    <p>She ap­peared in knee-high boots and was seated so­cially dis­tanced from the other mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Blackpink: Light Up The Sky, which pre­miered on Net­flix yes­ter­day, is a way for the group to get closer to fans.</p>
    <p>Mem­ber Jen­nie, 24, who wore a menswear-in­spired white shirt, says: “From our trainee days to our de­but to to­day, it shows all the hard work man­i­fested on stage, but it also shows authen­tic mo­ments we have off­stage that we can share with fans.”</p>
    <p>Jisoo, 25, and Thai­land-born Lisa, 23, com­plete the quar­tet, which are one of the most suc­cess­ful K-pop girl groups of all time.</p>
    <p>Their de­but songs Boom­bayah and Whis­tle hit No. 1 and 2 on Bill­board’s World Dig­i­tal Song Sales Charts in 2016.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic video for their 2018 song Ddu-Du Ddu-Du has 1.3 bil­lion views – the most for any K-pop group.</p>
    <p>The mem­bers are also ac­tive in fash­ion and beauty, be­ing the face of brands such as lux­ury French fash­ion houses Dior, Chanel, Ce­line and Saint Laurent.</p>
    <p>In the doc­u­men­tary, the four mem­bers have in­di­vid­ual sit-down in­ter­views and con­ver­sa­tions about their gru­elling trainee days and jour­ney to fame get per­sonal and emo­tional, with some shed­ding tears.</p>
    <p>The cam­era also goes be­hind the scenes of the group’s Coachella per­for­mance last year. They were the first fe­male K-pop act to per­form at the Cal­i­for­nia mu­sic fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Vo­cal­ist Jisoo, hair pulled back in a pony­tail and with gold hoops on her ears, says: “We wanted to show Blinks (the name given to Blackpink fans) the hon­est side of our­selves, so hav­ing those heart-to­heart con­ver­sa­tions was very nec­es­sary for us.”</p>
    <p>Lisa, the group’s rap­per, sported her sig­na­ture bangs and wore a ma­roon suit.</p>
    <p>She says of hav­ing a cam­era crew con­stantly around: “At first, it was a lit­tle awk­ward and we weren’t fully com­fort­able. But I think when we got used to it, we just for­got about it and be­came more play­ful.”</p>
    <p>The group credit feel­ing open and com­fort­able dur­ing film­ing to Korean-Amer­i­can doc­u­men­tary direc­tor Caro­line Suh (Salt Fat Acid Heat, 2018).</p>
    <p>While K-pop agen­cies, like Blackpink’s man­age­ment YG En­ter­tain­ment, are usu­ally fiercely pro­tec­tive of their artists’ im­age, Suh says in a sep­a­rate video in­ter­view with The Straits Times that she faced no push­back dur­ing film­ing.</p>
    <p>“YG re­ally stepped back when we were plan­ning the film and de­ferred to the Blackpink mem­bers about what they were com­fort­able shoot­ing and talk­ing about.”</p>
    <p>Suh, who was present at the press con­fer­ence via video call, ad­mits she was not an avid lis­tener of K-pop be­fore work­ing with Blackpink.</p>
    <p>Her im­pres­sions of the group changed af­ter work­ing with them.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised through film­ing that the mem­bers are very in­volved in the cre­ative process of their mu­sic. I pre­vi­ously thought that they just got songs de­liv­ered to them.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “The four of them are re­ally like sis­ters, like fam­ily. I hope the film will hu­man­ise them.”</p>
    <p>Jen­nie reflects on the mem­bers’ re­la­tion­ship: “We’ve been to­gether since we were teenagers to now, when we are in our 20s. We’ve seen one an­other grow and we’re very open about our opin­ions among our­selves.”</p>
    <p>Aside from doc­u­men­taries, Blackpink are keen to ex­plore other ways of en­hanc­ing the fan ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Jisoo says: “Mu­sic doesn’t stop at mu­sic these days. The vi­su­als are im­por­tant, au­di­ences like to take part in the mu­sic they lis­ten to and maybe imi­tate it.</p>
    <p>“There are many dif­fer­ent fac­tors in­volved now and we al­ways want to bring some­thing new to the ta­ble. I think that’s why our fans love us.”</p>
    <p>Blackpink: Light Up The Sky is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
