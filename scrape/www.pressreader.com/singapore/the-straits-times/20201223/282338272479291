    <p>Sin­ga­pore-based tech­nol­ogy giant Sea, which owns e-com­merce plat­form Shopee, has rapidly grown to be­come South-east Asia’s most valu­able com­pany and one of the re­gion’s largest tech play­ers over the past year.</p>
    <p>Group chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder For­rest Li was named Busi­ness­man of the Year at the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Awards last month – tes­ta­ment to the plucky firm’s trans­for­ma­tion since its scrappy start in 2009.</p>
    <p>Mr Li, 43, a nat­u­ralised Sin­ga­porean, is now one of the re­gion’s most well-known tech names.</p>
    <p>Sea, which started as a game pub­lisher, now op­er­ates in dig­i­tal fi­nance along­side its e-com­merce and gam­ing arms in mar­kets in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, Indonesia and Thailand. Its share price has shot up this year, soar­ing above US$200 ear­lier this month com­pared with around US$40 in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The New York-listed group was re­cently awarded one of Sin­ga­pore’s two dig­i­tal full bank li­cences, and this is ex­pected to ac­cel­er­ate its growth in dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Shopee has been reap­ing the gains in e-com­merce amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – its gross mer­chan­dise value in the third quar­ter was up 102.7 per cent year on year to US$9.3 bil­lion (S$12.4 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The e-com­merce busi­ness is not yet prof­itable, but Mr Li has said Sea’s pri­or­ity for Shopee is to cap­ture the growth op­por­tu­ni­ties and mar­ket share in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Sea’s first self-made mo­bile game, Free Fire, has drawn tens of mil­lions of play­ers glob­ally since its launch in 2017, and con­tin­ues to grow. An­a­lyt­ics firm App An­nie said Free Fire was the high­est­gross­ing mo­bile game in South­east Asia and Latin Amer­ica in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While his com­pany is at­tain­ing new heights glob­ally, Mr Li has con­tin­ued to con­trib­ute back to Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy. The Shopee Univer­sity ini­tia­tive, for in­stance, helps firms adapt their prod­ucts to the dig­i­tal plat­form and grow their on­line busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Sea signed a me­moran­dum of in­tent with the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity to hire and train around 500 Sin­ga­pore­ans over the next two years un­der a com­pany-led ini­tia­tive. It has also be­gun of­fer­ing train­ing cour­ses for mid-ca­reer job seek­ers as part of the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>In April, it launched a seller sup­port pack­age to help lo­cal busi­nesses get through the eco­nomic cri­sis, through means such as lower advertisin­g costs.</p>
    <p>Mr Li was also one of the judges of En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s start-up com­pe­ti­tion Sling­shot this year.</p>
    <p>At his ac­cep­tance speech at the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Awards last month, he cred­ited Sin­ga­pore for Sea’s as well as his own suc­cess, not­ing that he had come here from Tian­jin in China with barely any sav­ings and rented a bed­room in a three-room flat.</p>
    <p>He pledged to con­tinue us­ing tech to level the play­ing field. “It is now more crit­i­cal than ever for us to help those who are un­com­fort­able with tech­nol­ogy to learn how to use it, so that no­body is left be­hind. This has al­ways been a con­cern for Sea, and some­thing we will fo­cus more on,” he said.</p>
