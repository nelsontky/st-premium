    <p>The build­ing con­trac­tor for a Pung­gol Build-To-Or­der (BTO) project has been fired for fail­ing to meet project mile­stones, the Hous­ing Board (HDB) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the project, Water­way Sun­rise II, is likely to be de­layed by about a year. This means home own­ers who were ex­pect­ing to move into their new flats in the mid­dle of next year may now get their keys only in the first or sec­ond quar­ter of 2022.</p>
    <p>On July 28, Lian Ho Lee Con­struc­tion in­formed HDB that it had to cease work at the BTO site due to dif­fi­cul­ties in con­tin­u­ing with the project.</p>
    <p>HDB told The Straits Times it has been mon­i­tor­ing the progress of works at the site closely. This month, it ter­mi­nated the con­trac­tor’s ser­vices for “fail­ing to per­form its du­ties ef­fec­tively”.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, a con­trac­tor has been ap­pointed to se­cure the site and to pro­vide en­vi­ron­men­tal con­trol ser­vices such as to pre­vent mos­quito breed­ing.</p>
    <p>HDB said it is in the midst of bring­ing on board a new con­trac­tor to com­plete re­main­ing works.</p>
    <p>The BTO project com­prises 1,014 units across seven blocks, fea­tures a base­ment carpark and was launched in Fe­bru­ary 2017. The hous­ing project is cur­rently around 45 per cent com­plete, HDB said.</p>
    <p>Fu­ture home own­ers of a Build-ToOrder (BTO) project in Pung­gol are fac­ing a one-year de­lay af­ter the Hous­ing Board ter­mi­nated the build­ing con­trac­tor’s ser­vices this month.</p>
    <p>The project, Water­way Sun­rise II, has 1,014 units in seven blocks. Block 653A was orig­i­nally es­ti­mated to be com­pleted in the first quar­ter of next year, while the re­main­ing six blocks were set to be ready in the sec­ond quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>The de­lay means home own­ers may now get keys to their flats only in the first or sec­ond quar­ter of 2022.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, the HDB said the build­ing con­trac­tor, Lian Ho Lee Con­struc­tion, has “not been able to meet project mile­stones” over the past few months.</p>
    <p>The HDB said it has been mon­i­tor­ing the progress of works at the site.</p>
    <p>On July 28, the con­trac­tor in­formed the HDB that due to dif­fi­cul­ties in con­tin­u­ing with the project, it would have to cease op­er­a­tions at the site.</p>
    <p>The HDB did not spec­ify what those dif­fi­cul­ties were. Calls and emails from ST to Lian Ho Lee Con­struc­tion went unan­swered.</p>
    <p>The HDB said: “As the con­trac­tor had failed to per­form its du­ties ef­fec­tively, we ter­mi­nated their ser­vices to safe­guard the in­ter­est of flat buy­ers. We have com­menced the process to quickly bring on board a new con­trac­tor to com­plete the re­main­ing works.”</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, a con­trac­tor has been ap­pointed to se­cure the site and to pro­vide en­vi­ron­men­tal con­trol ser­vices such as the pre­ven­tion of mos­quito breed­ing.</p>
    <p>The hous­ing project is cur­rently about 45 per cent com­pleted. It was launched in Fe­bru­ary 2017.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult of the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, the ter­mi­na­tion of the build­ing con­tract and the ad­di­tional time needed to pro­cure a new con­trac­tor, we expect a pro­jected de­lay of about 12 months,” said the HDB. “We recog­nise the in­con­ve­nience that this brings to our flat buy­ers and will try our best to min­imise the de­lays.”</p>
    <p>Flat buy­ers will be kept up­dated on the re­vised com­ple­tion date through on­line por­tal My HDBPage as con­struc­tion pro­gresses.</p>
    <p>ST ob­served dur­ing a visit yes­ter­day that an ad­ja­cent BTO project,</p>
    <p>Water­way Sun­rise I, which was launched in Novem­ber 2016, ap­pears to be fur­ther along in the con­struc­tion process. The project com­prises about 1,200 units.</p>
    <p>The HDB had pre­vi­ously said some BTO projects would be de­layed by about six to nine months be­yond their es­ti­mated com­ple­tion dates due to Covid-19, al­though it would strive to re­duce the de­lays.</p>
    <p>Home own­ers were in­formed of the year-long de­lay at Water­way Sun­rise II via e-mails and let­ters sent by the HDB on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Many had ex­pected to move into their new flats next year.</p>
    <p>Some took to pri­vate group chats on Tele­gram and Face­book started by fel­low home own­ers to ex­press their frustratio­n.</p>
    <p>One home owner who wanted to be known only as Ms Sukina said she has been rent­ing a bed­room for the past 14 years, mov­ing as many as five times.</p>
    <p>The 55-year-old of­fice at­ten­dant, who pays $600 in monthly rental, had been look­ing for­ward to her two-room flexi flat and was dis­ap­pointed to hear of the de­lay.</p>
    <p>“When I fi­nally man­aged to get this BTO flat af­ter many tries, I thought that since I’ve waited for so many years, it’s okay to wait for an­other four years, but now this hap­pens,” she said.</p>
