    <p>Stroke is the fourth-most com­mon killer in Sin­ga­pore. As the world marks World Stroke</p>
    <p>Day this month on Oct 29, here are some facts about the deadly silent killer and what can be done to pre­vent it.</p>
    <p>Q A</p>
    <p>What is stroke?</p>
    <p>It oc­curs when there is a dis­rup­tion of blood sup­ply to a part of the brain, re­sult­ing in dam­age to that area.</p>
    <p>TWO MAIN TYPES</p>
    <p>• Ischaemic stroke: This oc­curs when blood flow to the brain is ob­structed by a clot. It is more com­mon, con­tribut­ing to about 80 per cent of stroke cases. • Hae­m­or­rhagic stroke: This oc­curs when there is bleed­ing in the brain, of­ten due to rup­ture/burst­ing of a blood ves­sel. It is less com­mon, making up the re­main­ing 20 per cent of stroke cases.</p>
    <p>Q How preva­lent is stroke?</p>
    <p>A Glob­ally, stroke is a lead­ing cause of death and dis­abil­ity, with 116 mil­lion years of healthy life lost each year to the dis­ease. One in four adults over the age of 25 will suf­fer from a stroke in their life­time.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, stroke is the fourth­most com­mon cause of death. The lat­est data shows that there were about 8,300 stroke cases ad­mit­ted to pub­lic hos­pi­tals in 2018, an in­crease of 5 per cent from 2017.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of stroke cases in Sin­ga­pore is ex­pected to in­crease as the pop­u­la­tion ages. The num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 65 and above is es­ti­mated to al­most dou­ble by 2030, making up a quar­ter of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>A An un­healthy life­style re­sults in a 66 per cent in­creased risk of stroke; 80 per cent of cases are pre­ventable through life­style mod­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the five most com­mon risk fac­tors are: hy­per­ten­sion (high blood pres­sure), high blood choles­terol, di­a­betes, smok­ing and atrial fib­ril­la­tion (ir­reg­u­lar heart­beat). Other mod­i­fi­able risk fac­tors in­clude obe­sity, low phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity, de­pres­sion and high al­co­hol in­take.</p>
    <p>Some non-mod­i­fi­able risks: • Age: The risk dou­bles ev­ery 10</p>
    <p>years af­ter age 55</p>
    <p>• Gen­der: Men have a higher risk. The risk in women in­creases af­ter menopause.</p>
    <p>• Fam­ily his­tory and pre­vi­ous</p>
    <p>his­tory of stroke</p>
    <p>How do I pre­vent stroke?</p>
    <p>Q What can I do to min­imise the risk?</p>
    <p>A Adopt a healthy life­style. Quit smok­ing and limit your al­co­hol in­take – no more than two stan­dard drinks for men and one stan­dard drink for women a day.</p>
    <p>Have a healthy diet low in fat and rich in fruit, vegetable and whole grain.</p>
    <p>Ex­er­cise reg­u­larly. Aim for at least 150 min­utes of mod­er­ate phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>Keep a healthy weight, with a body mass in­dex of 18.5 to 22.9.</p>
    <p>Have good con­trol of med­i­cal con­di­tions like high blood pres­sure, high choles­terol and di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Go for reg­u­lar health screen­ing.</p>
    <p>Q What are the warn­ing signs?</p>
    <p>A Call 995 if you see these signs of a stroke, known by the acronym Fast. F: Face weak­ness</p>
    <p>Does one side of the face droop? A: Arm weak­ness</p>
    <p>Can the per­son raise both arms and keep them up?</p>
    <p>S: Speech dif­fi­culty</p>
    <p>Does the per­son’s speech sound slurred or un­clear?</p>
    <p>T: Time to act fast</p>
    <p>If you ob­serve or ex­pe­ri­ence any of these signs, rush the per­son to the hospi­tal im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Q How can stroke be man­aged?</p>
    <p>A Treat­ment de­pends on the cause of stroke.</p>
    <p>For ischaemic stroke, the clot may be dis­solved by giv­ing medicine in­tra­venously, or is re­moved me­chan­i­cally – oth­er­wise known as en­dovas­cu­lar treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Hae­m­or­rhagic stroke is usu­ally treated with surgery or en­dovas­cu­lar ther­apy.</p>
