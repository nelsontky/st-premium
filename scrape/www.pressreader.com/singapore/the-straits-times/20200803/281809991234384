    <p>Thirty years ago, In­dian ar­chi­tect Chan­drakant Som­pura de­signed a tem­ple ded­i­cated to Lord Ram for the city of Ay­o­d­hya in the state of Ut­tar Pradesh.</p>
    <p>To­gether with the l ate Ashok Sing­hal, leader of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Par­ishad (VHP) who had con­tacted him, Mr Som­pura trav­elled to Ay­o­d­hya to map the land, which was at the heart of a cen­turies-old dis­pute be­tween Hindu and Mus­lim groups.</p>
    <p>The de­sign was in place well be­fore the bit­ter land dis­pute was re­solved and be­fore a Hindu mob de­stroyed the Babri Masjid, a 16th­cen­tury mosque, at the site, trig­ger­ing com­mu­nal ri­ots in which more than 2,000 peo­ple were killed.</p>
    <p>Now, con­struc­tion of the tem­ple based on Mr Som­pura’s de­sign is set to start, nine months af­ter the coun­try’s Supreme Court handed over the dis­puted land to Hindu groups and asked the fed­eral and Ut­tar Pradesh state gov­ern­ment to pro­vide a 2ha plot of land to Mus­lim groups in Ay­o­d­hya.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, a bhumi pu­jan – a rit­ual that is per­formed be­fore con­struc­tion can be­gin – will take place at Ay­o­d­hya.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Ay­o­d­hya have or­dered po­lice to pa­trol the streets and for bar­ri­cades to be set up to pre­vent big crowds gath­er­ing this week ahead of the event.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi is likely to be among the 200 peo­ple who will take part in the rit­ual, cap­ping a core prom­ise of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to its Hindu sup­port­ers to build the tem­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Som­pura’s de­sign from 30 years ago has re­mained, ex­cept for the size of the tem­ple.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one feels the area where the dar­shan (the act of see­ing the de­ity) takes place is small. Af­ter 30 years, the pop­u­la­tion has in­creased too much, there has been so much me­dia coverage of the Ram mandir (tem­ple) and the foot­fall of peo­ple will be much more than in 1990,” said Mr Som­pura’s son, ar­chi­tect Ashish Som­pura.</p>
    <p>“So we all have de­cided to do a new floor area. We don’t want to change the orig­i­nal de­sign.”</p>
    <p>He is work­ing with his fa­ther to update the de­sign, with two ad­di­tional domes for a to­tal of five, and a floor area of 30,000 sq ft.</p>
    <p>In 1990, he said, his fa­ther had de­signed the tem­ple to ac­com­mo­date 30,000 to 60,000 wor­ship­pers per day. Now the tem­ple ex­pects to draw 80,000 to 100,000 peo­ple every day.</p>
    <p>He added: “We also stud­ied the most-vis­ited tem­ples of In­dia, such as the Golden Tem­ple, Som­nath tem­ple and Tiru­pati, and the daily foot­falls be­fore we de­cided this is the area we want.”</p>
    <p>Mr Som­pura, whose fa­ther’s port­fo­lio in­cludes the de­sign for the Shiv Tem­ple in Sin­ga­pore, said the Ay­o­d­hya tem­ple will be built en­tirely of pink sand­stone and will take 31/ years to com­plete.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion of the mosque at an­other site has not started. Land has been given by the gov­ern­ment in Dhan­nipur vil­lage, 24km from the orig­i­nal site, in Ay­o­d­hya. The Ut­tar Pradesh Sunni Cen­tral Waqf Board last Wed­nes­day an­nounced the for­ma­tion of a trust to over­see the con­struc­tion of the mosque.</p>
    <p>The BJP came to na­tional promi­nence af­ter Hindu hard­lin­ers razed the mosque on Dec 6, 1992, plung­ing In­dia into months of com­mu­nal ri­ot­ing. Anti-Hindu protests over the in­ci­dent also took place in Pak­istan, Bangladesh and else­where at that time.</p>
    <p>A case is on­go­ing against VHP and BJP party lead­ers over the plan to de­mol­ish the mosque.</p>
    <p>The be­gin­ning of the tem­ple’s con­struc­tion, said po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts, would be a re­prieve for Mr Modi, who is bat­tling the chal­lenges of surg­ing Covid-19 cases and an ail­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Ni­lan­jan Mukhopad­hyay has said that the Ram tem­ple was part of a wider plat­form of the BJP to pro­mote “re­li­gio­cul­tural na­tion­al­ism”, where the mix of re­li­gion and cul­ture is held up as the epit­ome of In­dia.</p>
    <p>“Any­body who raises an ob­sta­cle is anti-In­dia.”</p>
    <p>The con­struc­tion of the tem­ple has been used as a po­lit­i­cal tool by the BJP to con­sol­i­date Hindu votes in parts of north­ern In­dia.</p>
    <p>Still, its con­struc­tion dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has at­tracted crit­i­cism from some po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents. In­dia has more than 1.5 mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases, with the num­bers con­tin­u­ing to climb.</p>
    <p>Ac­cus­ing the BJP of us­ing the Ram tem­ple as an elec­tion­eer­ing tool, Ma­ha­rash­tra chief min­is­ter Ud­dhav Thack­eray said in an in­ter­view pub­lished in Saa­mana, his party Shiv Sena’s mouth­piece, last week that the ground-break­ing cer­e­mony could be held by video-con­fer­ence in­stead.</p>
    <p>All In­dia Ma­jlis-e-It­te­hadul Mus­limeen pres­i­dent Asadud­din Owaisi also urged Mr Modi not to at­tend the cer­e­mony in his of­fi­cial ca­pac­ity but as a pri­vate ci­ti­zen, not­ing that a “mes­sage will go in the coun­try that the PM is sup­port­ing peo­ple of one faith only”.</p>
    <p>The BJP has dis­missed all crit­i­cism from the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese com­ments by var­i­ous op­po­si­tion lead­ers are un­called for, be­cause the Prime Min­is­ter has at­tended sev­eral reli­gious func­tions, not just of the Hindu faith, in the past also. To draw the Ram tem­ple into a po­lit­i­cal dis­course is nei­ther de­sir­able nor nec­es­sary,” said BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli.</p>
