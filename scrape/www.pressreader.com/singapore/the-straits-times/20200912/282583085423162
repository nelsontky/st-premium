    <p>Marathoner Soh Rui Yong yes­ter­day de­nied mak­ing defam­a­tory com­ments about former team­mate Ash­ley Liew to boost his so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing.</p>
    <p>The two-time SEA Games gold medal­list, who noted that he has “achieved a cer­tain recog­ni­tion be­cause of my re­sults, not be­cause of Ash­ley Liew”, was tes­ti­fy­ing in court for the first time as the de­fen­dant in the defama­tion suit brought against him by Liew.</p>
    <p>Un­der cross-ex­am­i­na­tion by Liew’s lawyer Mark Teng of That.Le­gal LLC, who put it to Soh that he pub­lished the post “with the in­ten­tion of gain­ing more fol­low­ers on so­cial me­dia, in­clud­ing In­sta­gram”,</p>
    <p>Soh replied: “Ab­so­lutely un­true.</p>
    <p>“How does me talk­ing about Ash­ley in­crease my pro­file?</p>
    <p>“My 16,000 (In­sta­gram) fol­low­ers I built by (per­form­ing) well in races and set­ting records... if any­thing, it’s di­vided opin­ions in the run­ning cir­cle... caused me more con­tro­versy and hurt. I don’t know what good can come out of it.”</p>
    <p>The dis­pute be­tween both run­ners be­gan in Oc­to­ber 2018 when Soh, in a com­ment on a Face­book post by the In­ter­na­tional Fair Play Com­mit­tee (IFPC), dis­puted Liew’s ac­count of an act of sports­man­ship dur­ing the 2015 SEA Games marathon.</p>
    <p>Liew said he had slowed down to al­low other run­ners to catch up af­ter they missed a U-turn and took the wrong path. He re­ceived a spe­cial award for sports­man­ship at the Sin­ga­pore Sports Awards in June 2016, and sub­se­quently won the Pierre de Cou­bertin World Fair Tro­phy in September that year.</p>
    <p>If any­thing, it’s di­vided opin­ions in the run­ning cir­cle ... caused me more con­tro­versy and hurt. I don’t know what good can come out of it.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Teng asked Soh: “I put it to you that you said (Liew) did not slow down to wait for his com­peti­tors to in­crease your so­cial me­dia in­flu­ence.”</p>
    <p>Soh, rep­re­sented by Clarence Lun of Fox­wood LLC, said: “I al­ready told you why it’s com­pletely base­less ... I dis­agree.”</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old had, ear­lier in the day, also said that it was “im­pos­si­ble” that Liew had slowed down.</p>
    <p>Teng had asked him: “And that’s be­cause you say that you caught up to him at the seven-minute mark?”</p>
    <p>Soh replied: “That’s one of the fac­tors. The sec­ond fac­tor is when I turned around, Ash­ley was 50m in front of me, he was run­ning in the same di­rec­tion ... I could ob­serve ev­ery­one in front of me at all points in time.”</p>
    <p>The court was also told that he had “up­dated slightly” his Oct 21, 2018 com­ment on the IFPC’s Face­book post.</p>
    <p>Asked by Teng what he had up­dated, Soh replied that while he had ini­tially writ­ten that the other run­ners took “at least one to two min­utes” to catch up to Liew dur­ing the 2015 race, he later edited this to “about seven min­utes”.</p>
    <p>Soh ex­plained: “I put at least one to two min­utes be­cause the pack was very big and I was not sure ex­actly at which point (Cam­bo­dian run­ner) Ku­ni­aki Tak­izaki over­took Ash­ley... I knew I took about seven min­utes but I couldn’t speak for Tak­izaki.</p>
    <p>“I knew he caught up to Ash­ley ear­lier, my point was just that he (Liew) didn’t stop or slow down to a crawl; if he did, we would have over­taken him within 10 to 20 sec­onds.”</p>
    <p>Teng, not­ing that Soh had amended the com­ment on Jan 29 this year, then also pointed out that the lat­ter ex­e­cuted his af­fi­davit of ev­i­dence-in-chief (AEIC) on Feb 21 this year.</p>
    <p>Teng added: “I put it to you that you edited your Face­book com­ment to the IFPC Face­book post so that the ev­i­dence that you ten­der be­fore this court would con­sis­tently say that you took seven min­utes, and not at least one to two min­utes to catch up to Ash­ley, do you agree?”</p>
    <p>Soh dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring Soh to Liew’s AEIC, in which Liew had said he slowed down for ap­prox­i­mately two-anda-half min­utes, Teng said: “This was not far off from your ini­tial es­ti­mate on Oct 21, 2018 of at least one to two min­utes to catch up to Ash­ley. So last chance, Mr Soh, did you take two min­utes or seven min­utes to catch up to Ash­ley?”</p>
    <p>Soh replied: “Seven min­utes.”</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues on Sept 24, with Soh ex­pected to re­turn to the stand.</p>
