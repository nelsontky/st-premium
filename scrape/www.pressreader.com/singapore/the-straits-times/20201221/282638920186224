    <p>St James’ Preschool Ser­vices op­er­ates three St James’ Church Kinder­gartens and 13 Lit­tle Seeds Preschools, with 2,640 or so chil­dren en­rolled.</p>
    <p>The kin­der­garten be­gan in 1977 and now has three cam­puses – in Lee­don, Hard­ing and Gil­stead.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Lit­tle Seeds Preschool was set up as the childcare arm of St James’ Preschool Ser­vices to cater to grow­ing childcare needs and con­sol­i­date the re­sources of faith-based cen­tres. One more cen­tre, Lit­tle Seeds Preschool @ St John’s – St Mar­garet’s Church, will open in Dover next month.</p>
    <p>Most of the cen­tres are in Hous­ing Board void decks, while three are in church premises, such as Cal­vary Bap­tist Kin­der­care and Lit­tle Seeds @ Pasir Pan­jang Hill Brethren Church.</p>
    <p>Fees for the kin­der­garten range from about $1,580 to $1,800 for each three-month term.</p>
    <p>This year, the Hard­ing kin­der­garten pi­loted a six-hour pro­gramme that will be ex­tended to more classes at the cen­tre, as well as to the Gil­stead cam­pus. This longer ses­sion will cost about $2,600 a term.</p>
    <p>Eleven of the Lit­tle Seeds Preschools will have lower fees from next year, as they come un­der the part­ner-op­er­a­tor scheme for the first time. The fee cap for a month of full-day childcare ser­vices will be $760 and, for half-day, $570.</p>
    <p>WHAT THE PRE-SCHOOLS OF­FER</p>
    <p>Dr Jac­que­line Chung, aca­demic di­rec­tor of St James’ Preschool Ser­vices, says its cen­tres fo­cus on learn­ing through projects sparked by chil­dren’s ques­tions about top­ics or phe­nom­ena. These in­clude ex­plor­ing light and shadow, sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues, reusing ma­te­ri­als cre­atively and story-writ­ing.</p>
    <p>Class­rooms have dis­cov­ery cen­tres and na­ture cor­ners and chil­dren have ac­cess to ar­eas with re­cy­clable ma­te­ri­als and loose parts to tin­ker with. Some cam­puses have spa­ces or stu­dios for con­struc­tion, light, art and sen­sory ex­plo­ration.</p>
    <p>Dr Chung says St James’ places em­pha­sis on val­ues and char­ac­ter de­vel­op­ment – some of which are based on the Chris­tian faith as well as the “7 Es­sen­tial Life Skills” by Amer­i­can au­thor Ellen Galin­sky. These in­clude love, re­spect, per­spec­tive-tak­ing, com­mu­ni­cat­ing and mak­ing con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren are taught the Chi­nese lan­guage through themes, projects and sto­ry­books, with ma­te­ri­als de­vel­oped and pub­lished in-house.</p>
    <p>Mu­sic and mo­tor skills de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes are also con­ducted fully in Chi­nese, so chil­dren can ac­quire the lan­guage nat­u­rally.</p>
    <p>Dr Chung says St James’ cur­ricu­lum is also in­spired by sev­eral over­seas ap­proaches.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is Key To Learn­ing, where chil­dren learn lan­guage, nu­mer­acy, prob­lem-solv­ing and col­lab­o­ra­tion skills through creative play. This is based on the learn­ing the­o­ries of Rus­sian psy­chol­o­gist Lev Vy­got­sky.</p>
    <p>An­other is a pro­gramme from Is­rael that en­cour­ages chil­dren to ask ques­tions about the world and come up with log­i­cal an­swers.</p>
    <p>“It is about de­vel­op­ing a sci­en­tific way of ob­serv­ing, analysing, think­ing, hy­poth­e­sis­ing, ver­i­fy­ing and then ar­tic­u­lat­ing one’s opin­ions, per­spec­tives and con­clu­sions,” says Dr Chung.</p>
