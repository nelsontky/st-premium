    <p>Should com­puter science be taught to the en­tire sec­ondary school co­hort?</p>
    <p>It’s a good idea to learn ba­sic com­puter pro­gram­ming from a young age.</p>
    <p>Ed­win Chua</p>
    <p>While I get that we’d want to equip stu­dents with cod­ing and com­puter science skills, not every­one has the ap­ti­tude for this. If you force cod­ing on a stu­dent who is al­ready strug­gling in core sub­jects such as math­e­mat­ics and science, it would not be a sur­prise if he hates school.</p>
    <p>Yazid Sal­lim</p>
    <p>Com­puter science should be com­pul­sory in sec­ondary school if we want Sin­ga­pore to be a smart city that does not need to rely on for­eign tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Ruzain Ghosh</p>
    <p>Don’t waste your time just to chase a trend. Make the knowl­edge avail­able on­line, and those who are in­ter­ested can pick it up as a hobby.</p>
    <p>Schools should teach stu­dents how to ac­quire knowl­edge through e-re­sources pro­vided by the Na­tional Li­brary Board. There are plenty of tu­to­ri­als that teach pro­gram­ming and other Stem (science, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing, and math­e­mat­ics) sub­jects. Why waste your time on other stuff and di­lute knowl­edge in core fun­da­men­tals?</p>
    <p>Lim Sait Kiat</p>
    <p>Yes. We need more IT ex­perts in the new econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Gary Teo</p>
    <p>The fu­ture is all about dig­i­tal, the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem needs a ma­jor re­vamp to cater for this evo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Jur Klopp</p>
    <p>If you are in­ter­ested to learn, you will find all ways to learn. If com­puter science is not taught in school, can’t you go to the li­brary to find out more your­self? You need the school to spoon-feed you?</p>
    <p>Chui Xi Tao</p>
    <p>Does the lan­guage in posters about sex crimes need to be changed?</p>
    <p>I don’t agree with peo­ple who say the lan­guage used in such posters con­sti­tutes vic­tim blam­ing. The posters are try­ing to en­cour­age vic­tims to speak up and re­port the of­fence to the po­lice, in­stead of stay­ing silent due to fear or em­bar­rass­ment. What’s wrong with that?</p>
    <p>Tan Hong Boon</p>
    <p>Mo­lesters know they are com­mit­ting a crime but the prob­lem is most of them think they will not get caught or they will get away with it be­cause no­body will re­port it, which is why ask­ing peo­ple to re­port is the right thing and should be en­cour­aged.</p>
