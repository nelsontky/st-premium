    <p>Af­ter Mr Chew Tai Heng was laid off from his job in 2018, it was not long be­fore he started his job search again.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew, 62, was pre­vi­ously a Project Man­ager at Voda­fone Sin­ga­pore, whose Tele­com Ex­pense Man­age­ment di­vi­sion was later ac­quired by Tan­goe Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But Tan­goe later closed its Sin­ga­pore of­fice to man­age its op­er­a­tions from the US and Mr Chew was then re­trenched.</p>
    <p>Thanks to help from Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) and its ap­pointed part­ner Ingeus, Mr Chew found a new job at Jani­son Asia in Septem­ber 2019, where he is a Project Man­ager man­ag­ing the de­ploy­ment and main­te­nance of the elec­tronic as­sess­ment soft­ware for Jani­son Asia’s ed­u­ca­tional clients in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Jani­son is an elec­tronic as­sess­ment and learn­ing soft­ware com­pany head­quar­tered in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of two adult chil­dren stepped up to the chal­lenges in his cur­rent job con­fi­dently .</p>
    <p>Mr Chew, who has a Master's de­gree in Com­puter Sci­ence, said: “I am tasked to com­plete our long-de­layed elec­tronic as­sess­ment de­ploy­ment for one of our clients. Af­ter all the ground­work laid by our pre­de­ces­sors and ded­i­cated sup­port from all stake­hold­ers in­clud­ing our Con­sor­tium part­ner, Prod­uct, De­vel­op­ment, Test Sup­port & Man­age­ment in­ter­nal teams, and also our client, we have man­aged to fi­nally sign off our sig­nif­i­cant Go Live project mile­stone.”</p>
