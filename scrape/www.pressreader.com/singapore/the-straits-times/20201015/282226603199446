    <p>LON­DON • Two-time world cham­pion Fernando Alonso said he was ready for a fresh start as he tested the lat­est Re­nault For­mula One car in Barcelona on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, also a two-time Le Mans 24 Hours win­ner, has not com­peted in a grand prix since he left McLaren at the end of 2018 but is re­turn­ing next year as the re­place­ment for the de­part­ing Aus­tralian Daniel Ric­cia­rdo.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be like a new begin­ning, get­ting sur­prised about the speed of the car, the brak­ing per­for­mance, the cor­ner speed, a lot of things that will sur­prise me once again,” the 39-year-old said be­fore the film­ing day for a pro­mo­tional video.</p>
    <p>The drive in the RS20 car came 20 years af­ter Alonso first tested with Benet­ton – the team who then be­came Re­nault – at the same cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>He scored two of his 32 F1 vic­to­ries in the Span­ish Grand Prix, in 2006 and 2013, and had five fur­ther podium fin­ishes on the track.</p>
    <p>Alonso said pre­par­ing for the lim­ited mileage outing had been com­pli­cated by Covid-19 re­stric­tions, with fewer days in the sim­u­la­tor to ad­just, but the run was worth it.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally very spe­cial for me to get back into an F1 car. The feel­ing was good. I think the car is ob­vi­ously out­per­form­ing me at the mo­ment, be­cause I can­not ex­tract the max­i­mum from the car,” he said af­ter com­plet­ing the max­i­mum 100km al­lowed un­der the test­ing rules in a ses­sion of­fi­cially be­ing used to make a pro­mo­tional film.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting back to the F1 speed is not so easy. I was im­prov­ing lap af­ter lap, and try­ing to give feed­back to the en­gi­neers. Also we had some film­ing to do, so there were cam­eras, there were drones fol­low­ing on track.”</p>
    <p>Team boss Cyril Abite­boul said af­ter Sun­day’s Eifel Grand Prix at Ger­many’s Nur­bur­gring, where Ric­cia­rdo fin­ished third for Re­nault’s first podium since their re­turn as a con­struc­tor in 2016, that Alonso was champ­ing at the bit to re­turn.</p>
    <p>“We re­ceived a mes­sage be­fore, dur­ing and af­ter the race,” said the French­man. “I think Fernando is like a big shark. And as soon as he starts to feel the blood he wants to at­tack. That’s what I see – I see a shark very hun­gry.”</p>
    <p>Alonso agreed in July to re­join Re­nault next sea­son when the team will com­pete as Alpine, the French man­u­fac­turer’s sports car brand. “I’m com­fort­able here with Re­nault,” he said. “Ev­ery­thing is a bit eas­ier when you know the faces and the team.”</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, who won his ti­tles with Re­nault in 2005 and 2006, raced in the Le Mans 24 Hours as well as the en­durance world cham­pi­onship, all with Toy­ota, since leav­ing F1.</p>
    <p>This year, he was 13th in the Dakar rally and 21st in his sec­ond In­di­anapo­lis 500 race.</p>
