    <p>While sev­eral gyms and fit­ness stu­dios here have shut­tered af­ter they were badly hit by the Covid-19 pan­demic, some are buck­ing the trend by open­ing more out­lets. F45 Tan­jong Rhu own­ers, for ex­am­ple, cited the good re­sponse to their free on­line classes dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker as a rea­son for open­ing their stu­dio at Kal­lang Wave Mall in June.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery evening for three hours, a buzz of ex­cite­ment fills a con­verted show­room in Tai Seng Street as 30 climb­ing en­thu­si­asts ma­noeu­vre their way across a large slab wall.</p>
    <p>While foot­fall has fallen by 30 per cent since the coro­n­avirus out­break, that did not stop Boul­der Move­ment from open­ing its sec­ond out­let on Aug 26, over two months af­ter Phase Two be­gan.</p>
    <p>Its mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor Michael Lim told The Straits Times: “Work on our sec­ond out­let started be­fore the cir­cuit breaker. If we were to stop, it’s more money wasted and it’s bet­ter to open than keep wait­ing in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>“We also fig­ured this is an op­por­tu­nity to sup­port our lo­cal sport­ing com­mu­nity and fit­ness en­thu­si­asts.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple may be bored with lim­ited fit­ness op­tions dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and we be­lieve climb­ing has some­thing to of­fer to our lo­cal sport­ing scene.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the un­cer­tainty brought about by the Covid-19 cri­sis, sev­eral gym own­ers are will­ing to take a chance.</p>
    <p>For BePi­lates founder Eu­gena Bey, own­ing her own stu­dio has been a dream since she started teach­ing pi­lates five years ago. She con­ducted on­line classes twice a week dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and opened the phys­i­cal space in Tan­jong Pa­gar in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Bey, 26, now teaches 12 to 13 classes of one to two stu­dents each a week. She said: “The cir­cuit breaker gave me some time to re­flect on what I want to do. I re­alised I en­joy teach­ing and this was some­thing I wanted to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>“There’s a pan­demic but it’s not some­thing to stop me from pur­su­ing my dream be­cause even­tu­ally, life must go on.”</p>
    <p>Chen Yu­peng, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing and in­ter­na­tional business at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) business school, said the de­mand for gyms has been strong even dur­ing the pan­demic as peo­ple want to stay fit and healthy.</p>
    <p>New stu­dios from es­tab­lished brands have an advantage over in­de­pen­dent ones as they are “more re­li­able in terms of the ser­vices they pro­vide”. “The chains are also likely to have a deeper pocket and likely to be less im­pacted by the pan­demic fi­nan­cially,” he added.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar Aus­tralian chains F45 and Body Fit Train­ing, which run on a fran­chise sys­tem here, have also opened new out­lets re­cently. Body Fit Train­ing Ou­tram launched its on­line pro­gramme on Sept 14 with its stu­dio due to open this month, while a third fran­chise will open next month in Paya Le­bar.</p>
    <p>F45 Tan­jong Rhu own­ers Barbora Ho­gan and Charmaine Wang opened their stu­dio at Kal­lang Wave Mall on June 25 af­ter good re­sponses to their free on­line classes held dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. The</p>
    <p>stu­dio was orig­i­nally slated to open in April.</p>
    <p>Each on­line class, held two to three times weekly, at­tracted be­tween 100 and 120 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to get to know our mem­bers a bit more so the Zoom classes were to build the com­mu­nity and it worked re­ally well be­cause we opened with fully booked classes,” said Ho­gan, adding that al­most all nine classes daily, capped at 18 par­tic­i­pants, are full.</p>
    <p>Anisha Pil­lai, 23, signed up af­ter at­tend­ing the vir­tual classes.</p>
    <p>She said: “The own­ers were pro­fes­sional and al­ways up­dated us on when they would open. They also told us what safety mea­sures they were go­ing to put in place so I felt safe com­ing to the gym.”</p>
    <p>The fit­ness in­dus­try, how­ever, re­mains badly im­pacted by Covid-19, with sev­eral gyms and stu­dios</p>
    <p>FROM ON­LINE TO OFF­LINE</p>
    <p>forced to shut down.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian jiu-jitsu (BJJ) gym Al­phaGeek saw its foot­fall re­duced by 70 per cent when it re­opened in Phase Two, said founder Robert Tan, 40. Each class could only ac­com­mo­date three to four peo­ple, down from the usual eight. Its main BJJ pro­gramme was also halted, and high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing and yoga classes were run in­stead.</p>
    <p>“A sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of our pro­gramme is no-gi grap­pling and BJJ – sport mar­tial arts with great em­pha­sis on throw­ing, grap­pling and live spar­ring,” said Tan, who opened the Ben­coolen stu­dio last Fe­bru­ary be­fore clos­ing it on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>“As a small stu­dio barely break­ing even with small mem­ber­ship num­bers in ‘nor­mal times’, along with no end of Phase Two in sight, it proved im­prac­ti­cal to con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>Caleb Tse, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at</p>
    <p>NTU’s business school, warned there are in­her­ent risks in start­ing a new business dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>He said: “This is an ag­gres­sive counter-cycli­cal strat­egy to prob­a­bly cap­ture more mar­ket share dur­ing this down­turn in hopes that they will be in a bet­ter po­si­tion when things turn around even­tu­ally. How­ever, the out­look for the con­sumer mar­ket on gym mem­ber­ships seems to be grim in gen­eral.”</p>
    <p>Both Boul­der Move­ment out­lets – the other is in Down­town Gallery – see an av­er­age of 40 users daily, down from the 60 pre­vi­ously seen at its Shen­ton Way venue, but Lim re­mains con­fi­dent.</p>
    <p>“We have a plan to man­age costs and the scale of things ef­fi­ciently so we don’t spend ex­ces­sively but still can de­liver on ex­pe­ri­ence,” he said.</p>
    <p>We wanted to get to know our mem­bers a bit more so the Zoom classes were to build the com­mu­nity and it worked re­ally well be­cause we opened with fully booked classes.</p>
