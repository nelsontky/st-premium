    <p>Four years ago, Ap­ple re­moved the 3.5mm head­phone jack from the iPhone 7. De­spite the ini­tial out­rage, you can­not find a head­phone jack on a flag­ship smart­phone to­day.</p>
    <p>Per­haps Asus is hop­ing for the same re­sult be­cause the Tai­wanese PC maker has done the same to its ZenBook 14. It is a gutsy move, as even Ap­ple note­books still re­tain the head­phone jack.</p>
    <p>Asus sent re­view­ers a pre­sen­ta­tion deck to de­fend its de­ci­sion, say­ing that con­sumers al­ready have Blue­tooth head­phones for their smart­phones that can also work with the ZenBook.</p>
    <p>It ex­plained that the notebook lacks the space for a head­phone jack be­cause it al­ready has an HDMI port and a USB Type-A port.</p>
    <p>But, to bor­row a line from Shake­speare’s Hamlet, me­thinks Asus doth protest too much.</p>
    <p>I do not buy the brand’s ar­gu­ments, as there ap­pears to be suf­fi­cient room on the ZenBook 14. And I can­not imag­ine my wire­less ear­buds be­ing able to last an en­tire work day on a sin­gle charge.</p>
    <p>The bun­dled USB-C-to-3.5mm don­gle helps to mit­i­gate this prob­lem, but it is yet an­other ac­ces­sory to carry around.</p>
    <p>The ZenBook 14 is avail­able in two vari­ants – the UX425 uses 10thgen­er­a­tion In­tel pro­ces­sors, while the UM425 is pow­ered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000-se­ries chips.</p>
    <p>The In­tel ver­sion has a slightly brighter 300-nit screen com­pared with 250 nits for the AMD model. And the In­tel ver­sion has Thun­der­bolt 3 ports (up to 40Gbps) while the AMD model has USB Type-C ports (up to 20Gbps).</p>
    <p>Both types of ports can be used to charge the lap­top.</p>
    <p>Th­ese dif­fer­ences aside, the two vari­ants have an iden­ti­cal chas­sis with an al­most-bezel-less 14-inch Full-HD non-touch dis­play.</p>
    <p>The top dis­play bezel is slightly thicker to ac­com­mo­date an in­frared 3D cam­era that can be used for fa­cial recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>While the max­i­mum screen bright­ness of the AMD-pow­ered UM425 is only 50 nits lower than the In­tel-based UX425, I find the UM425’s dis­play duller than the UX425. Both dis­plays do not look as vi­brant as other ul­tra­books I have tested.</p>
    <p>The lap­tops are very por­ta­ble at around 1.2kg. On pa­per, the In­tel model is slightly lighter than the AMD ver­sion, but the dif­fer­ence is neg­li­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>The ZenBook’s slim alu­minium body feels a bit creaky with some flex. The chas­sis ta­pers to a thin edge at the front lip, which digs slightly into my arms when they are rest­ing on the palm rest.</p>
    <p>De­spite the lap­top’s slim pro­file, its key­board has de­cent key travel. How­ever, typ­ing on it may take some ad­just­ment – es­pe­cially when lo­cat­ing the En­ter key – as the key­board has an ex­tra col­umn of keys at the right edge for the Home, Page Up/Down and End keys.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing tried sev­eral note­books with a com­pact 3:2 as­pect ra­tio re­cently, I also feel that the ZenBook is wide. This im­pres­sion is fur­ther re­in­forced by the touch­pad, which is wider than usual and clicky with a smooth glass sur­face.</p>
    <p>The touch­pad also dou­bles as a nu­meric key­pad. Tap the cal­cu­la­tor icon on its top-right cor­ner to get an il­lu­mi­nated nu­meric key­pad over­lay that is handy for data en­try.</p>
    <p>While there is lit­tle to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween the AMD and In­tel vari­ants of the ZenBook 14 i n de­sign and fea­tures, there is quite a sig­nif­i­cant gap in per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>The AMD-based UM425 has an eight-core Ryzen 7 4700U chip that hand­ily beats the quad-core In­tel i7-1065G7 chip in the UX425 in the PCMark 10 sys­tem bench­mark.</p>
    <p>The UM425 scores 5,150 com­pared with 4,324 for t he UX425. No­tably, the UM425 scores 32 per cent higher than the UX425 in the Dig­i­tal Con­tent Cre­ation seg­ment, which in­volves video and im­age ren­der­ing.</p>
    <p>But the ta­bles are turned in The Straits Times’ video-loop bat­tery life test. While the UM425 clocks a good re­sult of seven hours and 25 min­utes, the UX425 is much more power-ef­fi­cient, last­ing al­most nine hours in the same test.</p>
    <p>If you can ac­cept the lack of a head­phone j ack, the Asus ZenBook 14 of­fers good per­for­mance and ex­cel­lent bat­tery life in a por­ta­ble pack­age.</p>
    <p>Best of all, you can choose be­tween the AMD model, which also hap­pens to be slightly cheaper, for per­for­mance, and the In­tel ver­sion for bat­tery stamina.</p>
