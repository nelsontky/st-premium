    <p>Pupils weaker i n their mother tongue are get­ting a help­ing hand with a new pro­gramme that weaves more ac­tiv­i­ties and games i nto les­sons.</p>
    <p>Pri­mary 3 and 4 pupils in the Mother Tongue Sup­port Pro­gramme are taught i n smaller groups of five to 12.</p>
    <p>There are now 157 schools of­fer­ing the pro­gramme at the Pri­mary 3 level and 52 schools at the Pri­mary 4 level. By next year, it will be fully im­ple­mented for Pri­mary 3 pupils in all pri­mary schools. By 2022, it will be ex­panded to in­clude Pri­mary 4 pupils.</p>
    <p>Pupils who are weaker in their mother tongue are re­ceiv­ing help from a new pro­gramme that weaves more ac­tiv­i­ties and games into les­sons.</p>
    <p>In this Mother Tongue Sup­port Pro­gramme, Pri­mary 3 and 4 pupils are taught in smaller groups of five to 12 us­ing re­sources spe­cially pro­duced by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE).</p>
    <p>The min­istry started the pro­gramme as a pilot in 2018 with Pri­mary 3 pupils in 14 schools for Chi­nese lan­guage, and five schools each for Malay and Tamil.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, part of MOE’s ef­forts to pro­vide ex­tra sup­port and cus­tomi­sa­tion for pupils who find it a chal­lenge to learn their mother tongue, has since been ex­panded.</p>
    <p>There are now 157 schools of­fer­ing the Mother Tongue Sup­port Pro­gramme at the Pri­mary 3 level and 52 schools at the Pri­mary 4 level.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 2,940 Pri­mary 3 pupils and 872 Pri­mary 4 pupils are on the scheme, mak­ing up about 12 per cent of their co­horts in those schools.</p>
    <p>By next year, the sup­port pro­gramme will be fully im­ple­mented for Pri­mary 3 pupils in all pri­mary schools. There are around 185 pri­mary schools in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>By 2022, all Pri­mary 4 pupils will ben­e­fit too.</p>
    <p>Madam Heng Boey Hong, di­rec­tor of the mother tongue lan­guages branch in MOE’s cur­ricu­lum plan­ning and devel­op­ment di­vi­sion, said teach­ers use ac­tiv­i­ties and games dur­ing the pro­gramme to cre­ate “an en­joy­able and im­mer­sive lan­guage en­vi­ron­ment for stu­dents to learn their mother tongue lan­guage with con­fi­dence”.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, teach­ers use pic­ture, vo­cab­u­lary and flash cards to help stu­dents form words, phrases and sen­tences, as well as in­ter­ac­tive re­sources with mini games to en­cour­age stu­dents to re­visit and prac­tise what they have learnt,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing these les­sons, teach­ers also help pupils build a stronger foun­da­tion in their oral and read­ing skills, said Madam Heng.</p>
    <p>Schools can con­duct the sup­port pro­gramme within or out­side cur­ricu­lum time, de­pend­ing on their pupils’ needs and timetablin­g ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>In a speech in Au­gust, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong had said feed­back from schools of­fer­ing these ses­sions has been pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“We find that the stu­dents are more con­fi­dent in lis­ten­ing, speak­ing and read­ing, and they are show­ing greater mo­ti­va­tion in learn­ing their mother tongue lan­guages.”</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, he said, is the equiv­a­lent of learn­ing sup­port schemes for English lan­guage and math­e­mat­ics for l ower pri­mary pupils who need more guid­ance.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Wong: “It re­flects our be­lief that ev­ery stu­dent can ap­proach their mother tongue lan­guage with con­fi­dence, given the right sup­port. Over­com­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, in­clud­ing what may seem to be a dif­fi­cult lan­guage, is an es­sen­tial part of learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>House­wife Sri­ram Rekha, 39, said her Pri­mary 4 daugh­ter’s read­ing and writ­ing in Tamil im­proved af­ter she joined the Mother Tongue Sup­port Pro­gramme in St An­thony’s Pri­mary School last year.</p>
    <p>“Pre­vi­ously she couldn’t recog­nise Tamil let­ters, but she now writes with fewer spell­ing mis­takes and bet­ter vo­cab­u­lary,” she said.</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter started bor­row­ing Tamil books from the public li­brary and even took part in a Tamil sto­ry­telling com­pe­ti­tion or­gan­ised by a com­mu­nity club last year, where she picked up a bronze prize.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing the dif­fi­cul­ties that some stu­dents face in learn­ing their mother tongue lan­guage (MTL), the MOE has over the years al­lowed for a cus­tomised ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Pri­mary school pupils can take MTL at a foun­da­tion level, which cov­ers a sub­set of the stan­dard-level cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, in any year, about 4.5 per cent of stu­dents are ex­empted from study­ing MTL.</p>
    <p>At the sec­ondary school level, stu­dents who score C and be­low in their mother tongue sub­ject at the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion can take the MTL B syl­labus.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans re­turn­ing from over­seas who are un­able to cope with the sub­ject can also ap­ply for this syl­labus, and sec­ondary schools also have the flex­i­bil­ity to let their stu­dents take MTL B based on other fac­tors.</p>
