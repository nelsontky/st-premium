    <p>The de­bate in Par­lia­ment was spir­ited, with MPs stand­ing up one af­ter the other to speak about for­eign pro­fes­sion­als in the work­force. They urged the Govern­ment to en­sure com­pa­nies did not see the for­eign man­power pol­icy as a li­cence to hire for­eign­ers over Sin­ga­porean pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, en­gi­neers and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), and that com­pa­nies should bring in for­eign­ers only to plug a skills gap.</p>
    <p>Some sug­gested boost­ing train­ing pro­grammes for Sin­ga­pore­ans, and that there should be a trans­fer of skills from for­eign­ers to lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers spoke of Sin­ga­pore­ans feel­ing “cheesed off” and “con­cerned” over the per­ceived favourable treat­ment of non-cit­i­zens. Why should they be al­lowed to com­pete for jobs when com­pa­nies were re­trench­ing?</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment, for its part, stressed that the aim of al­low­ing com­pa­nies to hire for­eign­ers was to cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, who would al­ways be the foun­da­tion of the coun­try’s work­force.</p>
    <p>This was in March 1998, dur­ing the de­bate on min­istries’ bud­gets.</p>
    <p>But it could eas­ily have taken place last week dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, dom­i­nated by the theme of the Sin­ga­porean core in the work­force.</p>
    <p>Then, as it is now, Sin­ga­pore was en­ter­ing a re­ces­sion. In 1998, it was the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Now it is the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>‘FOR­EIGN TAL­ENT’</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment first an­nounced plans to bring in “for­eign tal­ent” to sup­ple­ment Sin­ga­pore’s work­force in 1988.</p>
    <p>The Em­i­nent En­treprenuer­s/Pro­fes­sion­als Scheme was open only to the most highly skilled pro­fes­sion­als from Hong Kong, in­clud­ing doc­tors, lawyers and com­puter sci­en­tists, and in 1988 it ad­mit­ted fewer than 100 peo­ple, who were of­fered per­ma­nent res­i­dency.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers were seen as help­ing to grow the eco­nomic pie by plug­ging the skills gap and off­set­ting pop­u­la­tion con­straints caused by low birth rates then, and also an age­ing pop­u­la­tion now.</p>
    <p>Over the years, as Sin­ga­pore looked to higher-value in­dus­tries like IT and fi­nance to grow its econ­omy, the pol­icy was broad­ened to al­low a larger va­ri­ety of for­eign­ers to work.</p>
    <p>From the be­gin­ning, MPs raised con­cerns that the new­com­ers would in­crease com­pe­ti­tion for jobs.</p>
    <p>In 1988, MP for Toa Payoh Eric Cheong asked in Par­lia­ment if “the in­flux (of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als) will ad­versely af­fect the ca­reer prospects of Sin­ga­pore­ans with sim­i­lar or equiv­a­lent pro­fes­sional qual­i­fi­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>As the econ­omy ex­panded and the global com­pe­ti­tion for tal­ent in­ten­si­fied, the Govern­ment started to en­cour­age com­pa­nies to re­cruit high-fly­ing pro­fes­sion­als over­seas. In the 1990s, com­pa­nies were given tax in­cen­tives to de­fray the costs of bring­ing in more for­eign­ers, and Jurong Town Cor­po­ra­tion flats were rented to them at below mar­ket rates.</p>
    <p>In 1998, with Asian economies reel­ing from the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the Govern­ment saw it as an op­por­tune time to at­tract dis­placed tal­ent. Changes were in­tro­duced to the Em­ploy­ment Pass sys­tem for com­pa­nies to bring in for­eign work­ers based on their qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sen­ti­ment against for­eign tal­ent hard­ened, and in the 1998 de­bate, with some MPs point­ing out that some cit­i­zens felt that the Govern­ment was rolling out a “red car­pet” for for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple also be­gan to ques­tion the use of the term “tal­ent” for for­eign­ers hold­ing sim­i­lar jobs and qual­i­fi­ca­tions as them­selves. They ques­tioned whether these new­com­ers were com­mit­ted to Sin­ga­pore and said they were us­ing the coun­try only as a step­ping stone un­til they gained enough ex­pe­ri­ence to move to more coveted des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>RE­SULT­ING BACK­LASH</p>
    <p>The ris­ing dis­con­tent peaked in 2008, along with the in­flux of new mi­grants at more than 200,000, in part due to mea­sures to at­tract pro­fes­sion­als from coun­tries af­fected by the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, said an In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies re­port from 2016 ti­tled Sen­ti­ments On Im­mi­gra­tion, In­te­gra­tion & The Role Of Mi­grant As­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Amid the eco­nomic down­turn and job cuts, this even­tu­ally re­sulted in the back­lash against im­mi­gra­tion and the for­eign worker poli­cies that con­trib­uted to the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s weak­est show­ing in a post-in­de­pen­dence gen­eral elec­tion, in 2011.</p>
    <p>Rules have since been pro­gres­sively tight­ened to limit the num­ber of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als en­ter­ing Sin­ga­pore, with the min­i­mum salary re­quire­ments for get­ting an Em­ploy­ment Pass raised from $3,900 to $4,500. For the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor, where the con­cen­tra­tion of for­eign pro­fes­sion­als has be­come a sore point, Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers will need to be paid at least $5,000 from Dec 1.</p>
    <p>At the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress last week, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong ac­knowl­edged the is­sue, say­ing that when a com­pany has an over-con­cen­tra­tion of a sin­gle for­eign na­tion­al­ity, es­pe­cially com­pared with other com­pa­nies in the same sec­tor, it sug­gests that it has not re­ally taken root in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This con­cen­tra­tion, if it is unchecked, can cause so­cial re­sent­ment and work­place prob­lems. It makes it harder for the com­pany to blend into and be ac­cepted by our mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It can cause prob­lems within the com­pany too, be­cause em­ploy­ees of other na­tion­al­i­ties – Sin­ga­porean or oth­ers – may find it harder to fit in, take pride in their work and see a fu­ture for them­selves in the firm.”</p>
    <p>Many MPs, call­ing for more pro­tec­tion for the Sin­ga­porean core in the work­force, shared sto­ries from res­i­dents of feel­ing like the mi­nor­ity at their work­places.</p>
    <p>For a na­tion-state that needs to be a global city to re­main rel­e­vant, and also a home for Sin­ga­pore­ans, the bal­ance be­tween for­eign pro­fes­sion­als and the Sin­ga­porean core will per­haps al­ways be tough to strike.</p>
