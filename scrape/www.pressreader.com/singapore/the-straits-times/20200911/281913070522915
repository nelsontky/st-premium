    <p>Will this year be 1954 all over again? For­give me, I have be­come ob­sessed with 1954, not be­cause it of­fers another ex­am­ple of a pan­demic (that was 1957) or an eco­nomic dis­as­ter (there was a mild US down­turn in 1953), but for more parochial rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen fifty-four saw the ap­pear­ance of two con­trast­ing vi­sions for the world of sta­tis­tics — vi­sions that have shaped our pol­i­tics, our me­dia and our health.</p>
    <p>This year con­fronts us with a sim­i­lar choice.</p>
    <p>The first of these vi­sions was pre­sented in How To Lie With Sta­tis­tics, a book by a US jour­nal­ist named Dar­rell Huff. Brisk, in­tel­li­gent and witty, it is a lit­tle mar­vel of nu­mer­i­cal com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The book re­ceived rave re­views at the time, has been praised by many statis­ti­cians over the years and is said to be the best-sell­ing work on the sub­ject ever pub­lished.</p>
    <p>It is also an ex­er­cise in scorn. Read it and you may be dis­in­clined to be­lieve a num­ber-based claim ever again.</p>
    <p>There are good rea­sons for scep­ti­cism to­day. David Spiegel­hal­ter, au­thor of last year’s The Art Of Sta­tis­tics: How To Learn From Data, laments some of the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s coro­n­avirus graphs and test­ing tar­gets as “num­ber the­atre”, with “dread­ful, aw­ful” de­ploy­ment of num­bers as a po­lit­i­cal per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“There is great dam­age done to the in­tegrity and trust­wor­thi­ness of sta­tis­tics when they’re un­der the con­trol of the spin doc­tors,” Spiegel­hal­ter says. He is right.</p>
    <p>But we geeks must be care­ful be­cause the dam­age can come from our own side too.</p>
    <p>For Huff and his fol­low­ers, the rea­son to learn sta­tis­tics is to catch the liars at their tricks. That scep­ti­cal mind­set took Huff to a very un­pleas­ant place. Once the cyn­i­cism sets in, it be­comes hard to imag­ine that sta­tis­tics could ever serve a use­ful pur­pose.</p>
    <p>But they can — and back in 1954, the al­ter­na­tive per­spec­tive was em­bod­ied in the pub­li­ca­tion of an aca­demic paper by Bri­tish epi­demi­ol­o­gists Richard Doll and Austin Brad­ford Hill. They mar­shalled some of the first com­pelling ev­i­dence that smok­ing cig­a­rettes dra­mat­i­cally in­creases the risk of lung can­cer. The data they as­sem­bled per­suaded both men to quit smok­ing and helped save tens of mil­lions of lives by prompt­ing oth­ers to do like­wise. This was no sta­tis­ti­cal trick­ery but a con­tri­bu­tion to pub­lic health that is al­most im­pos­si­ble to ex­ag­ger­ate.</p>
    <p>You can ap­pre­ci­ate, I hope, my ob­ses­sion with these two con­trast­ing ac­counts of sta­tis­tics: one as a trick, one as a tool. Epi­demi­ol­o­gists Doll and Hill’s painstak­ing ap­proach il­lu­mi­nates the world and saves lives into the bar­gain.</p>
    <p>Huff’s al­ter­na­tive seems clever but is the easy path: se­duc­tive, ad­dic­tive and cor­ro­sive. Scep­ti­cism has its place but eas­ily cur­dles into cyn­i­cism and can be weaponised into some­thing even more poi­sonous than that.</p>
    <p>The two world views soon be­gan to col­lide. Huff’s How To Lie With Sta­tis­tics seemed to be the per­fect illustrati­on of why or­di­nary, hon­est folk should not pay too much at­ten­tion to the slip­pery ex­perts and their du­bi­ous data.</p>
    <p>Such ideas were quickly picked up by the to­bacco in­dus­try, with its darkly bril­liant strat­egy of man­u­fac­tur­ing doubt in the face of ev­i­dence such as that pro­vided by epi­demi­ol­o­gists Doll and Hill. As de­scribed in books such as Merchants Of Doubt by Erik Con­way and Naomi Oreskes, this in­dus­try per­fected the tac­tics of spread­ing un­cer­tainty: call­ing for more re­search, em­pha­sis­ing doubt and the need to avoid dras­tic steps, high­light­ing dis­agree­ments be­tween ex­perts and fund­ing al­ter­na­tive lines of in­quiry. These tac­tics, and some­times even the same per­son­nel, were later used to cast doubt on cli­mate sci­ence.</p>
    <p>These tac­tics are pow­er­ful in part be­cause they echo the ideals of sci­ence. It is a short step from the Royal So­ci­ety’s motto, “nul­lius in verba” (take no­body’s word for it), to the cor­ro­sive ni­hilism of</p>
    <p>“no­body knows any­thing”.</p>
    <p>So will 2020 be another 1954? From the point of view of sta­tis­tics, we seem to be stand­ing at another fork in the road. The dis­in­for­ma­tion is still out there, as the pub­lic un­der­stand­ing of Covid-19 has been mud­died by con­spir­acy the­o­rists, trolls and gov­ern­ment spin doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Yet the in­for­ma­tion is out there too. The value of gather­ing and rig­or­ously analysing data has rarely been more ev­i­dent. Faced with a com­plete mys­tery at the start of the year, statis­ti­cians, sci­en­tists and epi­demi­ol­o­gists have been work­ing mir­a­cles. I hope that we choose the right fork, be­cause the pan­demic has lessons to teach us about sta­tis­tics if we are will­ing to learn.</p>
    <p>1 THE NUM­BERS MAT­TER</p>
    <p>With­out good data, for ex­am­ple, we would have no idea that this in­fec­tion is 10,000 times dead­lier for a 90-year-old than it is for a nine-year-old — even though we are far more likely to read about the deaths of young peo­ple than the el­derly, sim­ply be­cause those deaths are sur­pris­ing. It takes a sta­tis­ti­cal per­spec­tive to make it clear who is at risk and who is not.</p>
    <p>Good sta­tis­tics, too, can tell us about the preva­lence of the virus — and iden­tify hot spots for fur­ther ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>2 DON’T TAKE THE NUM­BERS FOR GRANTED</p>
    <p>But while we can use sta­tis­tics to cal­cu­late risks and high­light dan­gers, it is all too easy to fail to ask the ques­tion: “Where do these num­bers come from?” By that, I do not mean the now-stan­dard re­quest to cite sources; I mean the deeper ori­gin of the data.</p>
    <p>For all his faults, Huff did not fail to ask the ques­tion.</p>
    <p>He retells a cau­tion­ary tale that has be­come known as “Stamp’s Law” af­ter econ­o­mist Josiah Stamp — warn­ing that no mat­ter how much a gov­ern­ment may en­joy amass­ing sta­tis­tics, “raise them to the nth power, take the cube root and pre­pare won­der­ful di­a­grams”, it was all too easy to for­get that the un­der­ly­ing num­bers would al­ways come from a lo­cal of­fi­cial, “who just puts down what he damn pleases”.</p>
    <p>The cyn­i­cism is pal­pa­ble but there is insight here too. Sta­tis­tics are not sim­ply down­loaded from an In­ter­net data­base or pasted from a sci­en­tific re­port. Ul­ti­mately, they came from some­where. Some­body counted or mea­sured some­thing, ideally sys­tem­at­i­cally and with care. These ef­forts at sys­tem­atic count­ing and mea­sure­ment re­quire money and ex­per­tise – they are not to be taken for granted.</p>
    <p>In my new book, How To Make The World Add Up, I in­tro­duce the idea of “sta­tis­ti­cal bedrock” – data sources such as the cen­sus and the na­tional in­come ac­counts that are the re­sults of painstak­ing data col­lec­tion and anal­y­sis, of­ten by of­fi­cial statis­ti­cians who get lit­tle thanks for their pains and are all too fre­quently the tar­get of threats, smears or per­se­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>In Argentina, for ex­am­ple, long-serv­ing statis­ti­cian Gra­ciela Be­vac­qua was or­dered to “round down” in­fla­tion fig­ures, then de­moted in 2007 for pro­duc­ing a num­ber that was too high. She was later fined US$250,000 for false ad­ver­tis­ing — her crime be­ing to have helped pro­duce an in­de­pen­dent es­ti­mate of in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2011, Mr An­dreas Ge­or­giou was brought in to head Greece’s sta­tis­ti­cal agency at a time when it was re­garded as be­ing about as trust­wor­thy as the coun­try’s gi­ant wooden horses. When he started pro­duc­ing es­ti­mates of Greece’s deficit that in­ter­na­tional ob­servers fi­nally found cred­i­ble, he was pros­e­cuted for his “crimes” and threat­ened with life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
    <p>The foun­da­tions of our sta­tis­ti­cal un­der­stand­ing of the world are of­ten gath­ered in re­sponse to a cri­sis. We take it for granted now that there is such a thing as an “un­em­ploy­ment rate” but 100 years ago no­body could have told you how many peo­ple were search­ing for work. Se­vere re­ces­sions made the ques­tion po­lit­i­cally per­ti­nent so govern­ments be­gan to col­lect data.</p>
    <p>So it is with the Sars-CoV-2 virus. At first, we had lit­tle more than a few data points from Wuhan, show­ing an alarm­ingly high death rate of 15 per cent — six deaths in 41 cases. Quickly, epi­demi­ol­o­gists started sort­ing through the data, try­ing to es­tab­lish how ex­ag­ger­ated that case fa­tal­ity rate was by the fact that the con­firmed cases were mostly peo­ple in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Quirks of cir­cum­stance — such as the Di­a­mond Princess cruise ship, in which al­most ev­ery­one was tested — pro­vided more insight.</p>
    <p>Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity in the US launched a dash­board of data re­sources, as did the Covid</p>
    <p>Track­ing Project, an ini­tia­tive from The At­lantic mag­a­zine. An elu­sive and mys­te­ri­ous threat be­came leg­i­ble through the power of this data.</p>
    <p>That is not to say that all is well. Na­ture re­cently re­ported on “a coro­n­avirus data cri­sis” in the US, in which “po­lit­i­cal med­dling, dis­or­gan­i­sa­tion and years of ne­glect of pub­lic-health data man­age­ment mean the coun­try is fly­ing blind”.</p>
    <p>Nor is the US alone. Spain sim­ply stopped re­port­ing cer­tain Covid-19 deaths in early June, mak­ing its fig­ures un­us­able.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly in East Asia, pro­vide ac­ces­si­ble, us­able data about re­cent in­fec­tions to al­low peo­ple to avoid hot spots.</p>
    <p>These things do not hap­pen by ac­ci­dent: They re­quire us to in­vest in the in­fra­struc­ture to col­lect and an­a­lyse the data.</p>
    <p>3 EVEN THE EX­PERTS SEE WHAT THEY EX­PECT TO SEE</p>
    <p>Jonas Olof­s­son, a psy­chol­o­gist who stud­ies our per­cep­tions of smell, once told me of a clas­sic ex­per­i­ment in the field. Re­searchers gave peo­ple a whiff of scent and asked them for their re­ac­tions to it. In some cases, the ex­per­i­men­tal sub­jects were told:</p>
    <p>“This is the aroma of a gourmet cheese.” Oth­ers were told: “This is the smell of armpits.”</p>
    <p>In truth, the scent was both: an aro­matic mol­e­cule present both in runny cheese and in bod­ily crevices. But the re­ac­tions of de­light or disgust were shaped dra­mat­i­cally by what peo­ple ex­pected.</p>
    <p>But while solid data of­fers us in­sights we can­not gain in any other way, the num­bers never speak for them­selves. They, too, are shaped by our emo­tions, our pol­i­tics and, per­haps above all, our pre­con­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>A strik­ing ex­am­ple is the de­ci­sion, on March 23, to in­tro­duce a lock­down in Bri­tain. In hind­sight, that was too late.</p>
    <p>“Lock­ing down a week ear­lier would have saved thou­sands of lives,” says Kit Yates, au­thor of The Maths Of Life And Death – a view now shared by in­flu­en­tial epi­demi­ol­o­gist Neil Fer­gu­son, and by David King, chair of the “In­de­pen­dent Sage” group of sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>The logic is straight­for­ward enough: At the time, cases were dou­bling every three to four days. If a lock­down had stopped that process in its tracks a week ear­lier, it would have pre­vented two dou­blings and saved three-quar­ters of the 65,000 peo­ple who died in the first wave of the epi­demic, as mea­sured by the ex­cess death toll.</p>
    <p>Why, then, was the lock­down so late? No doubt there were po­lit­i­cal di­men­sions to that de­ci­sion, but se­nior sci­en­tific ad­vis­ers to the gov­ern­ment seemed to be­lieve that Bri­tain still had plenty of time. On March 12, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son was flanked by the gov­ern­ment’s chief med­i­cal ad­viser Chris Whitty, and chief sci­en­tific ad­viser Pa­trick Val­lance, in the first big set-piece press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Italy had just suf­fered its 1,000th Covid-19 death and Dr Val­lance noted that Bri­tain was about four weeks be­hind Italy on the epi­demic curve.</p>
    <p>With hind­sight, this was wrong: Now that late-reg­is­tered deaths have been tal­lied, we know that Bri­tain passed the same land­mark on lock­down day, March 23, just 11 days later. It seems that in early March the gov­ern­ment did not re­alise how lit­tle time it had. As late as March 16, Mr John­son de­clared that in­fec­tions were dou­bling every five to six days.</p>
    <p>The trou­ble, says Yates, is that Bri­tish data on cases and deaths sug­gested that things were mov­ing much faster than that, dou­bling every three or four days – a huge dif­fer­ence. What ex­actly went wrong is un­clear – but my bet is that it was a cheese-or-armpit prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Some in­flu­en­tial epi­demi­ol­o­gists had pro­duced so­phis­ti­cated mod­els sug­gest­ing that a dou­bling time of</p>
    <p>five to six days seemed the best es­ti­mate, based on data from the early weeks of the epi­demic in China.</p>
    <p>Yates ar­gues that the epi­demi­o­log­i­cal mod­els that in­flu­enced the gov­ern­ment’s think­ing about dou­bling times were suf­fi­ciently de­tailed and con­vinc­ing that when the patchy, am­bigu­ous, early Bri­tish data con­tra­dicted them, it was hard to read­just.</p>
    <p>We all see what we ex­pect to see. The data is in­valu­able but, un­less we can over­come our own cog­ni­tive fil­ters, the data is not enough.</p>
    <p>4 IN­SIGHTS FROM COM­BIN­ING STATS WITH PER­SONAL EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>The ex­pert who made the big­gest im­pres­sion on me dur­ing this cri­sis was in­fec­tious-dis­ease spe­cial­ist Nathalie MacDer­mott, at King’s Col­lege London, who in mid-Fe­bru­ary calmly de­bunked the more lurid pub­lic fears about how deadly the new coro­n­avirus was.</p>
    <p>Then, with equal calm, she ex­plained to me that the virus was very likely to be­come a pan­demic, that bar­ring ex­tra­or­di­nary mea­sures, we could ex­pect it to in­fect more than half the world’s pop­u­la­tion, and that the true fa­tal­ity rate was un­cer­tain but seemed to be some­thing be­tween 0.5 and 1 per cent. In hind­sight, she was broadly right about ev­ery­thing that mat­tered.</p>
    <p>Her ed­u­cated guesses pierced through the fog of com­plex mod­el­ling and data-poor spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>I was cu­ri­ous as to how she did it, so I asked her. “Peo­ple who have spent a lot of their time re­ally closely study­ing the data some­times strug­gle to pull their head out and look at what’s hap­pen­ing around them,” she said. “I trust data as well, but some­times when we don’t have the data, we need to look around and in­ter­pret what’s hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>She worked in Liberia in 2014 on the front line of an Ebola out­break that killed more than 11,000 peo­ple. At the time, in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions were san­guine about the risks, while the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties were in cri­sis. When she ar­rived in Liberia, the treat­ment cen­tres were over­whelmed, with pa­tients ly­ing on the floor, bleed­ing freely from mul­ti­ple ar­eas and dy­ing by the hour.</p>
    <p>The hor­ren­dous ex­pe­ri­ence has shaped her as­sess­ment of sub­se­quent risks: On the one hand, Sars-CoV-2 is far less deadly than Ebola; on the other, she has seen the ex­perts move too slowly while wait­ing for de­fin­i­tive proof of a risk. “From my back­ground work­ing with Ebola, I’d rather be over­pre­pared than un­der­pre­pared be­cause I’m in a po­si­tion of de­nial,” she said.</p>
    <p>There is a broader les­son here. We can try to un­der­stand the world through sta­tis­tics, which at their best pro­vide a broad and rep­re­sen­ta­tive over­view that en­com­passes far more than we could per­son­ally per­ceive.</p>
    <p>Or we can try to un­der­stand the world up close, through in­di­vid­ual ex­pe­ri­ence. Both per­spec­tives have their ad­van­tages and dis­ad­van­tages.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Muham­mad Yunus, a mi­cro­fi­nance pi­o­neer and No­bel lau­re­ate, has praised the “worm’s eye view” over the “bird’s eye view”. But birds see a lot too.</p>
    <p>Ideally, we want both the rich de­tail of per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence and the broader, low-res­o­lu­tion view that comes from the spread­sheet. Insight comes when we can com­bine the two — which is what Dr MacDer­mott did.</p>
    <p>5 EV­ERY­THING CAN BE PO­LARISED</p>
    <p>Re­port­ing on the num­bers be­hind the Brexit ref­er­en­dum, the vote on Scot­tish in­de­pen­dence, sev­eral gen­eral elec­tions and the rise of Mr Don­ald Trump, there was poi­son in the air. Many claims were made in bad faith, in­dif­fer­ent to the truth or even em­brac­ing the most pal­pa­ble lies in an ef­fort to di­vert at­ten­tion from the is­sues. Fact-check­ing in an en­vi­ron­ment where peo­ple did not care about the facts, only whether their side was win­ning, was a thank­less ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>For a while, one of the con­so­la­tions of do­ing data-driven jour­nal­ism dur­ing the pan­demic was that it felt bless­edly free of such po­lit­i­cal trib­al­ism. That did not last. Amer­ica po­larised quickly, with mask-wear­ing be­com­ing a badge of po­lit­i­cal iden­tity — and more gen­er­ally the Democrats seek­ing to un­der­line the threat posed by the virus, with Repub­li­cans fol­low­ing Pres­i­dent Trump in dis­miss­ing it as overblown. The prom­i­nent in­fec­tious-dis­ease ex­pert An­thony Fauci does not strike me as a par­ti­san fig­ure but the US elec­torate thinks oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>He is trusted by 32 per cent of Repub­li­cans and 78 per cent of Democrats.</p>
    <p>Rather than bring­ing some kind of con­sen­sus, more years of ed­u­ca­tion sim­ply seem to pro­vide peo­ple with the cog­ni­tive tools they re­quire to reach the po­lit­i­cally con­ve­nient con­clu­sion. From cli­mate change to gun con­trol to cer­tain vac­cines, there are ques­tions for which the an­swer is not a mat­ter of ev­i­dence but a mat­ter of group iden­tity.</p>
    <p>In this con­text, the strat­egy that the to­bacco in­dus­try pi­o­neered in the 1950s is es­pe­cially pow­er­ful. Em­pha­sise un­cer­tainty, ex­pert dis­agree­ment and doubt and you will find a will­ing au­di­ence. If no­body re­ally knows the truth, then peo­ple can be­lieve what­ever they want.</p>
    <p>All of which brings us back to</p>
    <p>Huff. While his in­ci­sive crit­i­cism of sta­tis­ti­cal trick­ery has made him a hero to many of my fel­low nerds, his ca­reer took a darker turn.</p>
    <p>Huff worked on a to­bacco-funded se­quel, How To Lie With Smok­ing Sta­tis­tics, cast­ing doubt on the sci­en­tific ev­i­dence that cig­a­rettes were dan­ger­ous. (Mer­ci­fully, it was not pub­lished.)</p>
    <p>He also ap­peared in front of a US Se­nate com­mit­tee that was pon­der­ing man­dat­ing health warn­ings on cig­a­rette pack­ag­ing and ex­plained to the law­mak­ers that there was a sta­tis­ti­cal cor­re­la­tion be­tween ba­bies and storks (which, it turns out, there is) even though the true ori­gin of ba­bies is rather dif­fer­ent. The con­nec­tion be­tween smok­ing and can­cer, he ar­gued, was sim­i­larly ten­u­ous.</p>
    <p>Huff’s sta­tis­ti­cal scep­ti­cism turned him into the an­ces­tor of to­day’s con­trar­ian trolls, spout­ing bullsh** while claim­ing to be the straight-talk­ing voice of com­mon sense. It should be a warn­ing to us all. There is a place in any­one’s cog­ni­tive tool­kit for healthy scep­ti­cism, but that scep­ti­cism can all too eas­ily turn into a re­fusal to look at any ev­i­dence at all.</p>
    <p>This cri­sis has re­minded us of the lure of par­ti­san­ship, cyn­i­cism and man­u­fac­tured doubt. But surely it has also demon­strated the power of hon­est sta­tis­tics. Statis­ti­cians, epi­demi­ol­o­gists and other sci­en­tists have been pro­duc­ing in­spir­ing work in the foot­steps of epi­demi­ol­o­gists Doll and Hill. I sug­gest we set aside How To Lie With Sta­tis­tics and pay at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Care­fully gather­ing the data we need, analysing it openly and truth­fully, shar­ing knowl­edge and un­lock­ing the puz­zles that na­ture throws at us — this is the only chance we have to de­feat the virus and, more broadly, an es­sen­tial tool for un­der­stand­ing a com­plex and fas­ci­nat­ing world.</p>
