    <p>PE­TAL­ING JAYA • Malaysia has ex­tended its re­stric­tions un­der the recovery phase of the move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) un­til March 31, said Se­nior Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said the Health Min­istry con­ducted risk as­sess­ments and found that cases were still in­creas­ing sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment agreed to ex­tend the recovery MCO na­tion­wide ex­cept for Se­lan­gor, Kuala Lumpur and Sabah as well as other lo­cal­i­ties placed un­der con­di­tional or en­hanced MCO,” he said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also said a few work­ers’ hos­tels in Johor – the Ke­jora Juara hos­tel in Muar and the Westlite 1 and 2 hos­tels in Se­nai – have been placed un­der an en­hanced MCO from to­day un­til Jan 15.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry yes­ter­day iden­ti­fied three new Covid-19 clus­ters in the coun­try, in­clud­ing in Se­lan­gor, Johor and Pe­nang.</p>
    <p>Malaysia recorded 2,068 more Covid-19 in­fec­tions on New Year’s Day, tak­ing the coun­try’s to­tal confirmed cases to 115,078.</p>
    <p>Three peo­ple also died from the coro­n­avirus, rais­ing Malaysia’s Covid-19 death toll to 474 cases.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is in the midst of a third wave of in­fec­tion which be­gan in late Septem­ber last year, sparked by the Sabah state leg­isla­tive elec­tions. Many of those who trav­elled to the east Malaysian state to cam­paign or vote re­turned to the penin­sula and spread the virus.</p>
