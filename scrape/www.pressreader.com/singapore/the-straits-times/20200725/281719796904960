    <p>Nobody in Sin­ga­pore is known to have been in­fected with Covid-19 a sec­ond time, but this is some­thing the au­thor­i­ties are mon­i­tor­ing very closely.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak noted, how­ever, that there is still not enough ev­i­dence to say with cer­tainty that a per­son who has re­cov­ered from the virus has long-last­ing im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Mak, who was speak­ing at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, said the min­istry con­tin­ues to keep an eye out for such cases.</p>
    <p>A grow­ing num­ber of anec­do­tal re­ports around the world of re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients who go on to get a sec­ond in­fec­tion have cast doubt on whether a vac­cine can give peo­ple long-last­ing im­mu­nity and whether herd im­mu­nity against the virus is achiev­able.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts are still un­sure if such re­ports show ev­i­dence of vul­ner­a­bil­ity to re­in­fec­tion as they could be the re­sult of false pos­i­tives in the ini­tial test re­sults.</p>
    <p>Some stud­ies have also shown that the lev­els of an­ti­bod­ies against the virus fall sharply in re­cov­ered pa­tients a few months af­ter in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>But other re­searchers have said an­ti­bod­ies are only part of the equa­tion be­cause pa­tients still have killer T-cells to combat the virus even if their an­ti­body lev­els have de­clined.</p>
