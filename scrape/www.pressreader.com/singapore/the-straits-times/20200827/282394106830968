    <p>Stuck at home dur­ing quar­an­tine, Mike Shin­oda, singer of rock band Linkin Park, turned to live stream­ing plat­form Twitch to reach out to fans and get them to help record his re­cently re­leased solo al­bums, Dropped Frames Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.</p>
    <p>He is among a num­ber of high­pro­file mu­si­cians who are us­ing Twitch – pre­vi­ously bet­ter known as a stream­ing plat­form for gamers – to en­gage with fans and cre­ate mu­sic with them.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old, who is also an artist and pain­ter, tells The Straits Times in a re­cent video in­ter­view from his Los An­ge­les home that he is not a fan of on­line gigs and longs to do live con­certs with a phys­i­cal au­di­ence again.</p>
    <p>“In the mean­time, I think in any time of ad­ver­sity or chal­lenge, cre­ative peo­ple find ways to ex­press them­selves and con­nect with their fans in new ways be­cause it’s what the cli­mate de­mands. We have to adapt and evolve.”</p>
    <p>When the lock­down started, Shin­oda says he started to lose track of time.</p>
    <p>“I would get half­way through a day and not know what day of the week it was or what time it was. And so I re­ally needed some struc­ture and some con­nec­tion with peo­ple,” the third-gen­er­a­tion Ja­pane­seAmer­i­can adds.</p>
    <p>He en­gaged with thou­sands of fans on Twitch sev­eral times a week and used their sug­ges­tions and ideas for the songs, as well as art­work that ap­pear on the al­bums.</p>
    <p>The song Open Door, found on Vol. 1, is the only tune that has singing and fea­tures vo­cals sub­mit­ted by fans. He is cur­rently work­ing on the third, and most likely fi­nal, vol­ume in the series.</p>
    <p>The al­bums are his first to fea­ture mostly in­stru­men­tals, which he says are a way for him to drown out the con­stant bar­rage of noise from the news and so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing is so noisy right now, ev­ery­thing’s de­mand­ing my at­ten­tion all the time. I feel like there’s a po­etry and sub­tlety to in­stru­men­tal mu­sic that helps me be less ag­i­tated. I feel like it calms my brain a lit­tle more than a lot of stuff that have words,” says the fa­ther of two, who is mar­ried to au­thor Anna Hillinger.</p>
    <p>Shin­oda, who has won Gram­mys and sold over 100 mil­lion records with Linkin Park, notes that he could have taken the easy route and en­gaged fans on other so­cial me­dia plat­forms such as In­sta­gram or</p>
    <p>Face­book where he has al­ready built up mil­lions of fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>“If you think about it, just start­ing a new Twitch chan­nel from zero fol­low­ers is like the stu­pid­est idea. Why would you do that? My man­ager thought it was crazy,” he says.</p>
    <p>Twitch ap­pealed to him be­cause he found that it en­abled him to have a deeper en­gage­ment with fans com­pared with other so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“You have to in­vest your­self in it a lit­tle bit in or­der to be a part of the com­mu­nity there, and I like that. The other thing I like is that there’re a lot of ac­tiv­i­ties to do while you’re watch­ing a stream.”</p>
    <p>Fans on his chan­nel, for ex­am­ple, rack up points by par­tic­i­pat­ing in chats, which can be used for things like re­quest­ing Shin­oda to do spe­cific art­work.</p>
    <p>Shin­oda’s new al­bums are per­fect ex­am­ples of how it is more im­por­tant than ever for mu­si­cians, artists, gamers and ath­letes to en­gage with their on­line com­mu­nity, says Ms Su­nita Kaur, Twitch’s se­nior vi­cepres­i­dent, Apac (Asia-Pa­cific).</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, view­ers are able to not only en­joy mu­sic cre­ated by new­com­ers and pro­fes­sion­als alike, but they also have a look into the cre­ative process of their favourite artists and be­come part of this process by con­tribut­ing ideas and opin­ions that shape the fi­nal prod­uct due to the in­ter­ac­tiv­ity of the ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>The plat­form of­fers mu­si­cians dif­fer­ent ways to make money – crit­i­cal at a time when they face re­stric­tions on live, phys­i­cal per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>Fans can sup­port them through op­tions such as paid sub­scrip­tions or buy vir­tual goods called “bits”, while artists can get shared rev­enue through ad­ver­tise­ments.</p>
    <p>Twitch also re­cently en­gaged Grammy-nom­i­nated Amer­i­can rap­per and mu­si­cian Logic as its first of­fi­cial mu­sic part­ner. He will do weekly streams that in­clude in­stu­dio, gam­ing and ques­tion-an­dan­swer ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Logic is also a gam­ing and e-sports en­thu­si­ast who is al­ready ac­tive in the Twitch com­mu­nity, says Ms Kaur.</p>
    <p>“He em­bod­ies the evo­lu­tion of creators that we’ve seen over the last few years on Twitch and un­der­stands the value of our com­mu­nity. He gets how pas­sion­ate and en­gaged our au­di­ence is and how they can also con­nect with and sup­port his mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur also re­veals that the com­pany is com­mit­ted to help­ing in­de­pen­dent mu­si­cians in Sin­ga­pore make money in a time when phys­i­cal gigs are cur­tailed.</p>
    <p>Without re­veal­ing any names, she says Twitch has been “hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions with po­ten­tial part­ners” in the Sin­ga­pore mu­sic scene.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­cited to spend more time get­ting closer to mu­sic in the Apac re­gion, as we do fore­see it to be the cat­e­gory with the largest po­ten­tial growth.”</p>
