    <p>Fugi­tive busi­ness­man Low Taek Jho (right) has claimed that mil­lions of dol­lars mis­ap­pro­pri­ated from 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) were just “loans” to him, ac­cord­ing to record­ings re­leased by Al Jazeera. In the record­ings, Low also blamed for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak for the fund’s down­fall.</p>
    <p>Fugi­tive busi­ness­man Low Taek Jho has claimed that mil­lions of dol­lars si­phoned from 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB), Malaysia’s debt-rid­den state fund, were merely loans to him.</p>
    <p>He went on to blame for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak for the down­fall of the fund.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness­man, who is more com­monly known as Jho Low, made the claims in con­ver­sa­tions with a Malaysian gov­ern­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tive that were made pub­lic by Al Jazeera yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He re­port­edly made the re­marks in recorded phone con­ver­sa­tions be­tween May and Novem­ber 2018</p>
    <p>– af­ter Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s coali­tion won the elec­tion that year, un­seat­ing Na­jib’s lon­grul­ing Barisan Na­sional coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Low’s rev­e­la­tions dur­ing the calls ap­peared to be a bid to bar­gain for his free­dom. He has been a fugi­tive from the law in both Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia since 2016.</p>
    <p>In the con­ver­sa­tions, Low said he be­lieved he had not com­mit­ted any wrong­do­ing. He de­scribed the mil­lions in 1MDB money that he had used to in­crease his own per­sonal wealth and as­sets as loans.</p>
    <p>“All th­ese ul­ti­mately were loans, di­rectly or in­di­rectly... I think the time has come, we want to as­sist in repa­tri­at­ing th­ese as­sets back... and mov­ing on with life with­out, you know, be­ing pros­e­cuted.”</p>
    <p>The US De­part­ment of Jus­tice has es­ti­mated that at least US$4.5 bil­lion (S$6 bil­lion) was looted from 1MDB dur­ing Na­jib’s ten­ure as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Low, who has two In­ter­pol red no­tices and a US ar­rest war­rant against him, has been a fugi­tive for the past four years.</p>
    <p>The record­ings are the first time he has been known to have made any pub­lic re­marks re­gard­ing his role in the scan­dal.</p>
    <p>He as­serted that the blame for the scan­dal lay at the feet of Na­jib, who, as Fi­nance Min­is­ter then, could au­tho­rise the trans­fer of 1MDB monies. Low also claimed he had spent north of US$500 mil­lion on jew­ellery and lux­ury items for Na­jib’s wife, Ros­mah Man­sor, us­ing 1MDB monies.</p>
    <p>“I have no au­thor­ity to make any de­ci­sion… It’s a pretty known fact that… all the ap­provals have to be ap­proved by the Min­is­ter of Fi­nance,” he said in the record­ings.</p>
    <p>Low also poured cold wa­ter on Na­jib’s years-long claim that about US$700 mil­lion which ended up in Na­jib’s per­sonal ac­count was a do­na­tion from Saudi Ara­bia’s late</p>
    <p>King Ab­dul­lah. “The re­al­ity is, it is true that King Ab­dul­lah ac­tu­ally agreed to give a do­na­tion to the PM, but that was a small por­tion of the larger por­tion.”</p>
    <p>Na­jib, who faces 42 counts of cor­rup­tion and money laun­der­ing re­lated to the 1MDB scan­dal, was con­victed on seven of the charges by the Malaysian High Court in July. He is out on bail pend­ing an ap­peal.</p>
    <p>At the time of the phone calls, Low was re­port­edly in China, and had skipped a meet­ing sched­uled to take place with his Malaysian gov­ern­ment con­tact in Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>Low’s Malaysian pass­port has been can­celled and his St Kitts and Ne­vis pass­port has also been de­ac­ti­vated. But Al Jazeera cited flight records show­ing his travel foot­print in­cluded mov­ing from Bangkok to Dubai via In­dia as re­cently as last Novem­ber on a pri­vately char­tered flight, us­ing yet another pass­port, is­sued by the Caribbean na­tion of Grenada.</p>
    <p>The report says Low has been liv­ing in Ma­cau, a spe­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive re­gion of China, since 2018.</p>
    <p>For­mer fi­nance min­is­ter Daim Zain­ud­din, who was a key ad­viser to Dr Ma­hathir’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, said in 2018 and last year that Low had tried to reach out to him to ne­go­ti­ate im­mu­nity from the gov­ern­ment and to of­fer help with ne­go­ti­a­tions over the East Coast Rail Link pro­ject.</p>
    <p>But Tun Daim told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that “he never spoke to him (Low)”.</p>
