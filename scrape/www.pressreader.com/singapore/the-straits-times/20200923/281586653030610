    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s plan for a par­tial re­turn of fans to sports sta­di­ums be­gin­ning on Oct 1 looks in­creas­ingly un­likely, with se­nior Cab­i­net min­is­ter Michael Gove say­ing yes­ter­day that the move is set to be post­poned ow­ing to new re­stric­tions to tackle a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has post­poned plans for the con­trolled re­turn of fans into sports sta­di­ums as part of new re­stric­tions an­nounced yes­ter­day to tackle a sec­ond wave of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment had been plan­ning to al­low 25-33 per cent ca­pac­i­ties from Oct 1, giv­ing sports a fund­ing boost af­ter months of empty sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>“We have to ac­knowl­edge that the spread of the virus is now af­fect­ing our abil­ity to re­open busi­ness con­fer­ences, ex­hi­bi­tions and large sport­ing events,” Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“So we will not be able to do this from the first of Oc­to­ber. I recog­nise the im­pli­ca­tions for our sports clubs, which are the life and soul of our com­mu­ni­ties... the chan­cel­lor and cul­ture sec­re­tary are work­ing ur­gently on what we can do now to sup­port them.”</p>
    <p>Se­nior Cab­i­net min­is­ter Michael Gove ear­lier told the BBC that, re­gard­ing the re­turn of spec­ta­tors, the gov­ern­ment was look­ing into “how we can for the mo­ment pause that pro­gramme”.</p>
    <p>The UK has raised its Covid-19 alert level from three to four, mean­ing trans­mis­sion is “high or ris­ing ex­po­nen­tially”. Fur­ther mea­sures in­clude a 10pm clos­ing time of all pubs, bars, restau­rants and other hos­pi­tal­ity venues in Eng­land, start­ing from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, chief sci­en­tific ad­viser Pa­trick Val­lance pre­dicted that, based on cur­rent trends, the daily count of cases will reach about 50,000 on Oct 13, and a month later, ex­ceed 200 deaths ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing fans away from sta­di­ums will come at a heavy fi­nan­cial cost. The Premier League has warned that foot­ball stands to lose £100 mil­lion (S$175 mil­lion) a month when games are played be­hind closed doors while the Rugby Foot­ball Union plans to make 139 staff re­dun­dant as it tries to cope with £107 mil­lion in lost rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Across Europe, virus in­fec­tions are also grow­ing along with re­stric­tions, though this has not de­terred or­gan­is­ers of ma­jor sports events.</p>
    <p>The past week­end in Ger­many saw sprin­kling of fans at foot­ball grounds. Some 9,300 were in Borus</p>
    <p>sia Dort­mund’s 80,000-ca­pac­ity sta­dium for their 3-0 win over Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach, while other sta­di­ums had as few as 300 fans.</p>
    <p>“This (spec­ta­tor num­bers) is some­thing that will need to be re­viewed ev­ery week,” Dort­mund sports di­rec­tor Michael Zorc said. “It was good (to have at least some fans) be­cause you could see it was a dif­fer­ent at­mos­phere. I think the fans were happy as well.”</p>
    <p>To­mor­row’s Uefa Su­per Cup match be­tween Cham­pi­ons League win­ners Bay­ern Mu­nich and Europa League hold­ers Sevilla is more</p>
    <p>am­bi­tious, and riskier, with Uefa and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties al­low­ing Bu­dapest’s Puskas Arena to fill up to one third of its 67,000 ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>It will also fea­ture trav­el­ling fans with 3,000 tick­ets avail­able to fol­low­ers of both clubs, with strict hy­giene mea­sures like so­cial dis­tanc­ing, tem­per­a­ture checks in place, while trav­ellers from abroad will have to present a ticket and proof of a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test.</p>
    <p>Nur­bur­gring, mean­while, can wel­come up to 20,000 fans next month when it hosts the For­mula One Ger­man Grand Prix, af­ter lo­cal au­thor­i­ties gave it the go-ahead along­side strin­gent health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tors have been con­spic­u­ously ab­sent from mo­tor sports’ top com­pe­ti­tion this year due to re­stric­tions but races later in the cal­en­dar have started to open up. The pre­vi­ous race at Tus­cany’s Mugello cir­cuit held around 2,000 fans, and the or­gan­is­ers of this week­end’s Rus­sian Grand Prix in Sochi are hop­ing for an au­di­ence of 30,000.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis’ French Open, which starts on Sun­day, will be the first Grand Slam to wel­come crowds. The US Open ear­lier this month was played be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing op­ti­misti­cally toyed with al­low­ing 20,000 fans to squeeze into the com­pact Roland Gar­ros site, that fig­ure was down­sized to 11,500, only to be slashed again to 5,000 by the French Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion as in­fec­tions rose.</p>
    <p>The clay-court tour­na­ment has come un­der fire from sev­eral play­ers. Last Mon­day, at the start of the qual­i­fiers, brought more bad news af­ter or­gan­is­ers said six play­ers in the men’s and women’s qual­i­fy­ing draw had been with­drawn due to Covid-19 con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Fears over the spread of the virus had al­ready prompted de­fend­ing cham­pion and women’s world No. 1 Ash­leigh Barty to skip the Paris event, where play­ers and their en­tourages will be con­fined to two bio-se­cure ho­tels.</p>
