    <p>I am writ­ing this from the con­fines of my room. I am cur­rently serv­ing my two-week quar­an­tine back in Sin­ga­pore but, be­ing in a ho­tel, it doesn’t feel like I am home yet.</p>
    <p>This ho­tel life means I have gone from con­stant com­pan­ion­ship and in­ter­ac­tion to sud­den iso­la­tion. The dra­matic shift has left me feel­ing bereft and out of sorts. I miss Bu­dapest, as well as my team­mates and the time we spent to­gether.</p>
    <p>Com­pet­ing in the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League (ISL) there was prob­a­bly one of the high­lights of my year. With only four months of train­ing af­ter three months out of the wa­ter dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, I wasn’t sure how I would per­form at my first com­pe­ti­tion of 2020.</p>
    <p>I knew that ev­ery­one there was in dif­fer­ent stages of train­ing, hav­ing come from his re­spec­tive home coun­try with var­i­ous Covid-19 health and safety mea­sures, and not ev­ery­one was go­ing to be at his best.</p>
    <p>That did not stop me from feel­ing the pres­sure to per­form. I was there with a pur­pose, and I wanted to de­liver.</p>
    <p>We raced at least once a week, and it was a mix of ex­haus­tion and fun. I learnt to swim fast while tired – to get up on the blocks over and over again, and to dive in and hold noth­ing back.</p>
    <p>Many times I would have a re­lay 15 min­utes be­fore an in­di­vid­ual event, or vice versa. Af­ter my first swim, I would go to the small div­ing pool, hid­den from view by a tall par­ti­tion from the main pool, and try to get as much re­cov­ery in be­fore my next race.</p>
    <p>I would swim laps in the dark, stop­ping at the walls to lis­ten to the com­men­ta­tor an­nounce events and the mu­sic boom. Af­ter about 400m of re­cov­ery, I would get up, dry my­self, put my game face on, and go into the call room. I would sit there with seven other girls, all wait­ing for our turn to swim.</p>
    <p>We were all tired, but no one would show it. So I also learnt to pre­tend that I wasn’t tired, that I wasn’t ner­vous. I learnt to ig­nore my shak­ing body as I bent over in the start­ing po­si­tion on the blocks, ig­nor­ing the ache and the ten­sion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a while my body kept up with my mind. I was still tired, but I learnt to push past the pain. My team were count­ing on me.</p>

    <p>I bent over in the start­ing po­si­tion on the blocks, ig­nor­ing the ache and the ten­sion. Af­ter a while my body kept up with my mind. I was still tired, but I learnt to push past the pain. My team were count­ing on me.</p>
    <p>BACK TO BACK RACES</p>
    <p>The ISL was faster paced than most reg­u­lar meets. There were no heats and fi­nals, and all events were mashed into two ses­sions over two days, each ses­sion last­ing ex­actly two hours.</p>
    <p>There were no medal cer­e­monies to space out the events, and the races were run back-to­back. There were only two fiveminute in­ter­mis­sions to break up each match into three parts.</p>
    <p>I swam 19 events over three weeks, and placed among the top four in 12 of them (at the ISL, be­ing in the top four means you win money). This is not the first time I have won money at a meet, but it is def­i­nitely the first time at a meet where I’ve thought of my­self as a pro­fes­sional and have em­braced the idea of mak­ing it work as a ca­reer.</p>
    <p>It would be nice to save some of it for school in the fu­ture, and in­vest the rest in busi­nesses or com­pa­nies that have val­ues and vi­sions aligned with my own.</p>
    <p>BEN­E­FITS OF THE BUB­BLE</p>
    <p>The bub­ble set-up was con­ducive for fast swim­ming. I was liv­ing, train­ing, eat­ing and learn­ing along­side my friends and team­mates. I watched, lis­tened and ab­sorbed. I felt like a stu­dent of the sport.</p>
    <p>Each time I jumped into the pool, I swam faster and my con­fi­dence grew. I broke na­tional records thrice, set a bunch of per­sonal best times, won a sil­ver in an in­di­vid­ual event, and gold in the re­lays. I swam along­side some of the best in the world, and held my own.</p>
    <p>I went to Hun­gary pre­pared only for the freestyle events, so I did not have much faith in my but­ter­fly race fit­ness. But I learnt that over the years I had built my foun­da­tion well and my body re­mem­bered what to do and how to move.</p>
    <p>I started off the first match with 58.03 sec­onds for the 100m fly and, by the last match, I had dropped it to 56.78. I am ex­tremely proud of what I have ac­com­plished.</p>
    <p>I am equally pleased with my growth as a per­son. I gained con­fi­dence out­side the pool and ac­tu­ally felt like I be­longed there, among the greats.</p>
    <p>I didn’t find be­ing in the bub­ble dif­fi­cult at all. The time flew by and, even at the end, I wasn’t en­tirely ready to leave.</p>
    <p>The only part about the bub­ble that I didn’t quite fancy was that we couldn’t leave Mar­garet Is­land ex­cept to go to the pool. We were for­tu­nate enough to go on a bus tour one day, but we couldn’t get off the bus for safety rea­sons.</p>
    <p>I am con­fi­dent that, with the right safety mea­sures and strict ad­her­ence to the health pro­to­cols, sim­i­lar com­pe­ti­tion bub­bles can be cre­ated. I think it was done re­ally well in Bu­dapest and so I am re­ally hope­ful for the Olympics next year.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing for­ward, Tokyo is still the dream. I want to be in Ja­pan next year with my sib­lings and we are work­ing our hard­est in sep­a­rate parts of the world to make that hap­pen.</p>
    <p>Olympic tri­als will be held next month, March and June. The quar­an­tine that I just started serv­ing means that I will be out of the wa­ter and dry for two weeks, and I will have only four days in the pool be­fore our first tri­als.</p>
    <p>I have de­cided to take it as a chal­lenge. The tri­als in March are when I will ta­per to get the cuts, but it would be fun to race next month and see where I am at in long-course me­tres rac­ing.</p>
    <p>The ISL was an in­cred­i­ble ex­pe­ri­ence, one that I will cher­ish for a long time. I hope it keeps gain­ing trac­tion and be­comes a per­ma­nent fix­ture i n the swim­ming world, be­cause its suc­cess could re­ally change the way our sport works, and help it progress to a whole new level.</p>
