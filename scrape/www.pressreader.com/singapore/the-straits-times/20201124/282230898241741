    <p>LON­DON • Danone will cut as many as 2,000 jobs, in­clud­ing one in four po­si­tions at its global head­quar­ters, as the world’s largest yo­ghurt maker at­tempts to re­vive prof­itabil­ity amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Danone has global head­quar­ter sites across the world in lo­ca­tions such as Am­s­ter­dam and Sin­ga­pore. About 400 to 500 jobs will be cut in France, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The job cuts rep­re­sent about 2 per cent of Danone’s to­tal staff.</p>
    <p>The maker of Danone and Ac­tivia yo­ghurt and Evian wa­ter also said yes­ter­day that it is con­sid­er­ing mov­ing global head­quar­ter sites for its var­i­ous busi­nesses lines closer to the base of its French op­er­a­tions in Paris. An­nual cost sav­ings should reach €1 bil­lion (S$1.59 bil­lion) by 2023, also fu­elled by more ef­fi­cient pur­chas­ing.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Em­manuel Faber is shift­ing the or­gan­i­sa­tion to fo­cus on ge­o­graph­i­cal zones rather than prod­uct cat­e­gories to be­come more ag­ile amid the pan­demic. Com­peti­tors like Nes­tle have long fol­lowed a re­gional strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“This year has shown our busi­nesses could be hurt sig­nif­i­cantly in their com­pet­i­tive­ness by ex­ter­nal shocks in coun­tries where we op­er­ate,” Mr Faber said on a call with re­porters. “In this very volatile world for the next sev­eral years, we need to cre­ate a safety mar­gin.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany also plans to re­duce the range of prod­ucts it sells by 10 to 30 per cent in the next year, fo­cus­ing on faster-grow­ing and more prof­itable prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>To­tal one-time costs re­lated to the changes will be about €1.4 bil­lion for the 2021-2023 pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Danone also said its ad­justed op­er­at­ing mar­gin should ex­ceed 15 per cent in 2022 and reach mid- to high-teen lev­els later, which would be a record level.</p>
    <p>Danone shares have slumped 29 per cent this year.</p>
