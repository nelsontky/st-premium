    <p>A prop­erty agent who lost her High Court bid last year to claim $316,000 from a mar­ried cou­ple has failed again at the ap­peal stage – but this time, her case was thrown out for a dif­fer­ent rea­son.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong Keh Choo, also known as Jean­nette, had sued Amer­i­can re­search sci­en­tist Paul Hunt­ing­ton Bernardo and his wife, Viet­namese med­i­cal concierge Tran Hong Hanh, for can­celling a cheque they had given her af­ter view­ing a Bal­moral Road apart­ment in Oc­to­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who are Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dents, can­celled the $316,000 cheque af­ter find­ing out that she was the owner of the apart­ment, a fact Ms Ong had failed to dis­close to them.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, the High Court dis­missed Ms Ong’s law­suit to claim the money, which she con­tended was the fee for an op­tion to pur­chase the $3.16 mil­lion prop­erty. The High Court judge ac­cepted the cou­ple’s ver­sion that the cheque had been is­sued only “for show”, that is, to show their sin­cer­ity as gen­uine buy­ers, pend­ing fur­ther ne­go­ti­a­tions with the owner on the price.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Court of Ap­peal, in a writ­ten judg­ment on Thurs­day, dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>The three-judge court con­cluded that the cheque was not is­sued “for show”, but rather, to se­cure an op­tion to pur­chase the prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal pointed to ev­i­dence such as de­tails on the coun­ter­foil of the cou­ple’s cheque book, What­sApp mes­sages between the par­ties and the ab­sence of price ne­go­ti­a­tions af­ter the cheque was is­sued. Still, the apex court dis­missed Ms Ong’s ap­peal be­cause the op­tion to pur­chase was ter­mi­nated mu­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>The court said mes­sages ex­changed between Ms Tran and Ms Ong were con­sis­tent with the buyer’s claim that the agent had of­fered to ter­mi­nate the op­tion and re­turn the cheque.</p>
    <p>There were other sub­se­quent mes­sages between them which showed that Ms Tran had ac­cepted the of­fer to ter­mi­nate the op­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­though the cou­ple won the ap­peal, the apex court awarded them only 25 per cent of the le­gal costs of the ap­peal and trial, not­ing that they suc­ceeded on only one main is­sue. “Much time and costs have been wasted by var­i­ous un­suc­cess­ful de­fences which they raised, some of which were in­con­sis­tent with other po­si­tions which they took,” said the judg­ment, de­liv­ered by Jus­tice Woo Bih Li.</p>
    <p>The court also noted that the cou­ple had filed an “un­nec­es­sary” coun­ter­claim, seek­ing a dec­la­ra­tion that the con­tract was void or un­en­force­able.</p>
    <p>This was “mean­ing­less be­cause all that is needed is a dis­missal of the plain­tiff’s claim”, said the court, which also com­prised Judge of Ap­peal Ju­dith Prakash and Jus­tice Belinda Ang.</p>
    <p>“This is not to say that we over­look the ap­pel­lant’s con­duct in mis­lead­ing the re­spon­dents as to who the true owner was,” said the court.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the court said Ms Ong had acted “un­scrupu­lously” in seek­ing to take ad­van­tage of Ms Tran by im­pos­ing dis­ad­van­ta­geous terms of pay­ment in the op­tion to pur­chase.</p>
    <p>The terms stated that the cou­ple had to pay an op­tion fee of 10 per cent of the pur­chase price, when the usual mar­ket prac­tice is 1 per cent. The cou­ple also had to pay the re­main­ing 90 per cent upon ex­er­cise of the op­tion, rather than the typ­i­cal prac­tice of pay­ing upon com­ple­tion.</p>
