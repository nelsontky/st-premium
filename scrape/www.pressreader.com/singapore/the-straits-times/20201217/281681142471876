    <p>MS MACKEN­ZIE SCOTT, EX-WIFE OF AMA­ZON CEO JEFF BE­ZOS, WHO DO­NATED $5.6 BIL­LION IN FOUR MONTHS</p>
    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Ms MacKen­zie Scott, the for­mer wife of Ama­zon founder Jeff Be­zos, said she has given US$4.2 bil­lion (S$5.6 bil­lion) to groups help­ing the vul­ner­a­ble as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hits lives like “a wreck­ing ball”.</p>
    <p>Ms Scott, 50, who for­merly went by the name MacKen­zie Be­zos, last year signed a “giv­ing pledge” to do­nate the bulk of her wealth to char­ity.</p>
    <p>In a round of do­na­tions early this year, she gave nearly US$1.7 bil­lion to groups de­voted to race, gen­der and eco­nomic equal­ity is­sues, as well as other so­cial causes.</p>
    <p>“This pan­demic has been a wreck­ing ball in the lives of Amer­i­cans al­ready strug­gling,” Ms Scott said on Tues­day in a post de­tail­ing her sec­ond round of giv­ing this year.</p>
    <p>“I have a dis­pro­por­tion­ate amount of money to share,” she wrote in her pledge.</p>
    <p>“My ap­proach to phi­lan­thropy will con­tinue to be thought­ful. It will take time and ef­fort and care. But I won’t wait. And I will keep at it un­til the safe is empty.”</p>
    <p>She noted that the wealth of bil­lion­aires has sub­stan­tially in­creased. Me­dia re­ports said Mr Be­zos’ wealth has grown al­most 80 per cent dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Scott was left a multi-bil­lion­aire af­ter her di­vorce last year from Mr Be­zos. She ranked 20th on a Forbes real-time list of the world’s rich­est peo­ple on Tues­day, with a net worth of US$56 bil­lion – af­ter tak­ing her lat­est do­na­tions into ac­count.</p>
    <p>Mr Be­zos was at the top of that list with a net worth of US$185 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ms Scott said she en­listed a team of ad­vis­ers that helped iden­tify 384 or­gan­i­sa­tions across the United States that sup­port peo­ple suf­fer­ing from the eco­nomic toll of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial at­ten­tion was given to or­gan­i­sa­tions work­ing to com­bat hunger, poverty and racial in­equity in com­mu­ni­ties, she added.</p>
