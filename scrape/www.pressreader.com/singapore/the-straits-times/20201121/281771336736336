    <p>LON­DON • Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Gilead’s remde­sivir is not rec­om­mended for pa­tients hos­pi­talised with Covid-19, re­gard­less of how ill they are, as there is no ev­i­dence the drug im­proves sur­vival or re­duces the need for ven­ti­la­tion, a World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) panel said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The panel found a lack of ev­i­dence that remde­sivir im­proved out­comes that mat­ter to pa­tients such as re­duced mor­tal­ity, need for me­chan­i­cal ven­ti­la­tion, time to clin­i­cal improvemen­t, and oth­ers,” the guide­line said.</p>
    <p>The ad­vice is an­other set­back for the drug, which grabbed global at­ten­tion as a po­ten­tially ef­fec­tive treat­ment for Covid-19 af­ter early tri­als showed some prom­ise.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir, also known as Vek­lury, is cur­rently au­tho­rised to treat Covid-19 pa­tients in more than 50 coun­tries. But a WHO-led trial known as the Sol­i­dar­ity Trial showed it had lit­tle or no ef­fect on 28-day mor­tal­ity or length of hos­pi­tal stays for Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir was one of the drugs used to treat United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s in­fec­tion, and had been shown in pre­vi­ous stud­ies to have cut time to re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Gilead has ques­tioned the Sol­i­dar­ity Trial’s re­sults. “Vek­lury is recog­nised as a stan­dard of care for the treat­ment of hos­pi­talised pa­tients with Covid-19 in guide­lines from nu­mer­ous cred­i­ble na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions,” Gilead said.</p>
    <p>The WHO said its rec­om­men­da­tion, which is not bind­ing, was based on an ev­i­dence re­view that in­cluded data from four in­ter­na­tional ran­domised tri­als in­volv­ing more than 7,000 pa­tients hos­pi­talised with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor of emerg­ing in­fec­tious diseases Peter Horby from the Univer­sity of Ox­ford said the ad­vice should prompt a re­think.</p>
    <p>“Remde­sivir is an ex­pen­sive drug that must be given in­tra­venously for five to 10 days, so this rec­om­men­da­tion will save money and other health­care re­sources,” he said.</p>
