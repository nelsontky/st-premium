    <p>Like most app de­vel­op­ers, Mr John Botte wants his work to end up on some of the 1.5 bil­lion ac­tive iPhones on the mar­ket. But when the soft­ware en­gi­neer did the maths on a photo-shar­ing app he hoped to cre­ate for wed­ding guests, he de­cided against it.</p>
    <p>The im­ped­i­ment, said Mr Botte, co-founder of the mar­ket­ing agency Dig­i­tal Na­tives Group, was Ap­ple’s 30 per cent com­mis­sion in its App Store. He said the fee would be the largest con­trib­u­tor to tak­ing in barely US$1 (S$1.40) in rev­enue from a planned US$10 monthly sub­scrip­tion fee. “I couldn’t see how we’d make any money,” Mr Botte said.</p>
    <p>Those fees, which af­fect the mi­nor­ity of apps that charge for sub­scrip­tions or vir­tual goods, are at the cen­tre of a US fed­eral court hear­ing to­mor­row that could set the stage for a pro­tracted fight over how app stores run by both Ap­ple and Google op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Mr Botte’s ex­pe­ri­ence mir­rors that of a num­ber of de­vel­op­ers I’ve spo­ken with over the years. Smaller de­vel­op­ers who can­not ab­sorb losses dur­ing their first year or two on the mar­ket of­ten shy away from Ap­ple’s dig­i­tal store­front, dis­suaded by its shift­ing rules, fixed fees and capri­cious ap­proval pro­cesses. (Many re­fused to iden­tify them­selves pub­licly for fear of reprisal by Ap­ple over any fu­ture apps or busi­ness.)</p>
    <p>I be­lieve Ap­ple when it says it wants to al­low more apps in its store. But if de­vel­op­ers aren’t even ap­ply­ing be­cause of the lousy eco­nom­ics, then the com­pany is do­ing a dis­ser­vice to both de­vel­op­ers and cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion of whether Ap­ple wields too much power over its dig­i­tal bazaar has come to a head in re­cent weeks af­ter Epic Games, maker of the enor­mously pop­u­lar role-play fight­ing game Fort­nite, sued Ap­ple and Google over their fees. Epic took up the bat­tle af­ter Ap­ple and Google re­moved Fort­nite from their stores when the com­pany en­cour­aged users to pay for the game di­rectly rather than through app stores where they would be sub­ject to the levies.</p>
    <p>At the hear­ing, a judge will con­sider whether to com­pel</p>
    <p>Ap­ple to al­low Fort­nite back into the App Store.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court last year al­lowed to pro­ceed a con­sumer-driven class-ac­tion law­suit charg­ing that Ap­ple vi­o­lates an­titrust laws with its App Store com­mis­sions, thus in­flat­ing app prices. Euro­pean of­fi­cials have opened an an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Ap­ple over its App Store op­er­a­tions. Ap­ple’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Tim Cook – along with other tech ti­tans – was hauled be­fore Congress over the sum­mer to talk pri­mar­ily about the App Store as part of a panel on an­titrust is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple says the fees and use of its pro­pri­etary pay­ments sys­tem are nec­es­sary, not just to make a profit but also to pay for safe­guards in the App Store that pre­vent bad ac­tors from en­ter­ing and com­pro­mis­ing user se­cu­rity. The com­pany has also noted that its 30 per cent fee is equal to Google’s and less than the fees com­pa­nies were com­pelled to pay when soft­ware was sold in phys­i­cal stores. (It said those fees were at least 50 per cent.)</p>
    <p>And the com­pany notes that the com­mis­sion gets de­vel­op­ers ac­cess to Ap­ple’s cus­tomers. Though, of course, if no de­vel­op­ers of­fered apps in the store, cus­tomers would likely es­chew Ap­ple’s iPhones.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple has shown a will­ing­ness to adapt its fees, drop­ping the com­mis­sion to 15 per cent af­ter a full year of sub­scrip­tions. But that raises the ques­tion of how Ap­ple can jus­tify the higher fee if 15 per cent is enough to pay for all the things the com­pany says it sup­plies app de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple does not dis­close how much it col­lects an­nu­ally in fees from the App Store, but es­ti­mates range from US$15 bil­lion to</p>
    <p>US$19 bil­lion – it is clearly huge and hugely prof­itable.</p>
    <p>A for­mer App Store ex­ec­u­tive told The New York Times last month that “we’re re­al­is­ing that 30 per cent is way too much”, and that the com­mis­sion should be closer to 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son, Epic’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Tim Sweeney told</p>
    <p>Times Opin­ion that it costs the com­pany be­tween 5 per cent and 7 per cent of sales to op­er­ate its games stores, and it col­lects 12 per cent from de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>I don’t know what the right com­mis­sion should be – Ap­ple had once con­sid­ered an even higher rate of 40 per cent – but as Ap­ple has de­signed it, it will never face com­pet­i­tive pres­sure to change. That’s where the real prob­lem lies.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple could in­crease its com­mis­sion to­mor­row and there would be no com­peti­tor to jump in and of­fer a lower price. The free mar­ket should de­cide the fee. Ap­ple notes that a small mi­nor­ity of apps, 16 per cent, pay the com­mis­sion, but might that be higher if the fee was con­sid­ered more rea­son­able?</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s cen­tral ar­gu­ment that it faces com­pet­i­tive pres­sure from An­droid loses much of its weight when you con­sider the cost and has­sle of switch­ing mo­bile op­er­at­ing sys­tems – pho­tos, pass­words, text mes­sages and video game high scores can all be lost with a new de­vice. Con­sumers switch­ing to Google will find an op­er­at­ing sys­tem that has mir­rored Ap­ple’s fees and is fac­ing an­titrust al­le­ga­tions of its own, though at least on An­droid, other app stores are al­lowed to com­pete, and there are al­ter­na­tive means to down­load­ing an app onto a de­vice.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the con­gres­sional an­titrust panel, Mr Cook had ar­gued that “Ap­ple does not have a dom­i­nant mar­ket share in any mar­ket where we do busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>But it faces no com­pe­ti­tion on its own de­vices. It’s akin to Ford de­sign­ing cars so that only Exxon noz­zles fit its petrol tanks. You may want the lower prices of­fered at the Chevron petrol sta­tion in town, but you’d have to switch to Chevro­let to get them.</p>
    <p>And there are other seem­ingly ar­bi­trary rules gov­ern­ing the</p>
    <p>App Store. Ama­zon, for in­stance, is al­lowed to avoid pay­ing the fees by di­rect­ing Kin­dle e-book buy­ers to its web­site, the kind of work­around that raises Ap­ple’s ire against other app mak­ers. Ap­ple doesn’t mind be­cause e-books are dig­i­tal ver­sions of phys­i­cal goods, which don’t trig­ger the fee, an Ap­ple of­fi­cial con­fus­ingly ex­plained to me.</p>
    <p>Uber and Lyft don’t pay the com­mis­sion ei­ther, even though ar­rang­ing rides is an en­tirely dig­i­tal act.</p>
    <p>Mr Sweeney, in an interview, said his US$17.3 bil­lion com­pany can cer­tainly af­ford to keep pay­ing Ap­ple hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars per year from the sale of dig­i­tal goods within Fort­nite, but he views the fight as a mat­ter of prin­ci­ple. “Ap­ple makes more profit from most games than the de­vel­op­ers them­selves make,” he said. “And that just sucks.”</p>
    <p>His chal­lenge to Ap­ple and Google has at­tracted the at­ten­tion of Mi­crosoft, which ar­gued on Epic’s be­half in a court fil­ing, as well as a coali­tion an­nounced last Thurs­day that in­cludes 12 com­pa­nies sid­ing with Epic, such as Spo­tify and Match Group, par­ent com­pany of dat­ing apps Tin­der and Hinge.</p>
    <p>“Mar­kets func­tion prop­erly when de­vel­op­ers and con­sumers can make free choices be­tween each of the dif­fer­ent com­po­nents they want to use in run­ning their lives”, like smart­phones, apps and how they pay for things, said Mr Sweeney. “Each com­po­nent of the ecosys­tem should be able to com­pete with each other freely.”</p>
    <p>It would be bet­ter for Ap­ple to com­pete on an even play­ing field with other app stores and pay­ment sys­tems, and prove that its is truly the best. That way, Mr Botte’s app might be ready in time for the post-pan­demic wed­ding rush.</p>
    <p>I don’t know what the right com­mis­sion should be – Ap­ple had once con­sid­ered an even higher rate of 40 per cent – but as Ap­ple has de­signed it, it will never face com­pet­i­tive pres­sure to change. That’s where the real prob­lem lies. Ap­ple could in­crease its com­mis­sion to­mor­row and there would be no com­peti­tor to jump in and of­fer a lower price.</p>
