    <p>• Health of­fi­cials in Aus­tralia’s most pop­u­lous state made “un­jus­ti­fi­able” and “in­ex­cus­able” mis­takes which al­lowed cruise ship pas­sen­gers with Covid-19 to dis­em­bark in cen­tral Syd­ney, an in­quiry said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Car­ni­val Cor­po­ra­tion’s Ruby Princess was, for a time, Aus­tralia’s big­gest sin­gle source of in­fec­tion, with more than 600 cases and over 20 deaths linked di­rectly to those pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>Some 2,700 pas­sen­gers, 120 of whom were feel­ing un­well, were al­lowed to leave the ship on March 19, help­ing to spread the virus across the coun­try and in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>New South Wales Health failed to en­sure that the ship knew of height­ened screen­ing for the virus or that sick pas­sen­gers were iso­lated in their cab­ins, a re­port by the in­quiry con­cluded.</p>
    <p>It also failed to get quick test re­sults for un­well pas­sen­gers be­fore they dis­em­barked.</p>
    <p>“The de­lay in ob­tain­ing test re­sults for the swabs taken from the Ruby Princess on the morn­ing of March 19 is in­ex­cus­able.</p>
    <p>“Those swabs should have been tested im­me­di­ately,” the in­quiry, led by high-pro­file l awyer Bret Walker, said in the re­port.</p>
    <p>The “de­ci­sion to as­sess the risk as ‘low risk’, mean­ing in ef­fect ‘ do noth­ing’, is as in­ex­pli­ca­ble as it is un­jus­ti­fi­able”, it added.</p>
    <p>NSW Health di­rected me­dia in­quiries to State Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian, who said in a state­ment she would read the re­port at the week­end be­fore re­spond­ing.</p>
    <p>The 315-page re­port did not make for­mal rec­om­men­da­tions and stopped short of call­ing for gov­ern­ment res­ig­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Car­ni­val Cor­po­ra­tion said the re­port con­firmed that none of its em­ploy­ees mis­led the Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties, which was “of great im­por­tance to us be­cause it goes to the in­tegrity of our peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>The Ruby Princess had com­pleted a Syd­ney-New Zealand round trip. Around two-thirds of the pas­sen­gers were Aus­tralians.</p>
    <p>The re­port was pub­lished as neigh­bour­ing Vic­to­ria state, now home to Aus­tralia’s big­gest out­break and which has put its cap­i­tal un­der a hard lock­down, recorded 14 more deaths yes­ter­day – one in­volv­ing a man in his 20s, the coun­try’s youngest fa­tal­ity so far.</p>
    <p>The state logged 372 new cases, a jump of nearly 100 from the pre­vi­ous day, which was the low­est in more than three weeks.</p>
    <p>“We will see a lev­el­ling-off of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions for com­mu­nity cases in the next cou­ple of weeks and the same for deaths,” said Vic­to­ria chief health of­fi­cer Brett Sut­ton.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s coron­avirus tally stands at 22,739 in­fec­tions and 375 deaths, most of them in Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>New South Wales re­ported nine new cases yes­ter­day.</p>
