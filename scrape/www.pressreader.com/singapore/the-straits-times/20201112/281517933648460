    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will be able to travel to Hong Kong for leisure from Nov 22 in the first air travel bub­ble ar­range­ment for the Re­pub­lic since bor­der re­stric­tions were im­posed amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The scheme will start with one flight a day into each city, with a quota of 200 trav­ellers a flight, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung an­nounced here yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This will be in­creased to two flights a day from Dec 7.</p>
    <p>The ar­range­ment will be sus­pended for two weeks if the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of the daily num­ber of un­linked Covid-19 cases is more than five in ei­ther Sin­ga­pore or Hong Kong, the Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (CAAS) said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>As part of the air travel bub­ble scheme, those trav­el­ling to Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong will have to take Covid-19 tests in lieu of serv­ing quar­an­tine or stay-home no­tices. There will be no re­stric­tions on the pur­pose of travel and no need for a con­trolled itin­er­ary.</p>
    <p>But trav­ellers must meet el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria and ad­here to the pre­vail­ing bor­der con­trol mea­sures and public health re­quire­ments of both cities, said CAAS.</p>
    <p>All trav­ellers will be re­quired to test neg­a­tive on a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test 72 hours be­fore their sched­uled de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>On arrival i n Hong Kong, trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore will be re­quired to take an­other Covid-19 test and re­main at the air­port un­til the re­sults are con­firmed. This could take about four hours, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate brief­ing in Hong Kong, Sec­re­tary for Com­merce and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Ed­ward Yau said the test at the Hong Kong In­ter­na­tional Air­port for ar­riv­ing vis­i­tors will cost HK$499 (S$87).</p>
    <p>There is no such re­quire­ment for trav­ellers ar­riv­ing here from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Asked why, Mr Ong said the scheme is “not de­signed to be sym­met­ri­cal” and should al­low flex­i­bil­ity within own ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, for ex­am­ple, re­quires trav­ellers to down­load the con­tract trac­ing app TraceTo­gether and ap­ply for an air travel pass.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong were con­cluded ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>CAAS said: “The good progress in con­tain­ing the spread of Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong has given us the con­fi­dence to re­open our bor­ders grad­u­ally, with safe­guards in place to en­sure our public health and safety.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said the air travel bub­ble en­ables Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong to open up their bor­ders in a con­trolled man­ner, while main­tain­ing safety in both so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>“While we may be start­ing small, this is an im­por­tant step for­ward. I have no doubt both Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong will co­op­er­ate fully to make this scheme work,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that this ar­range­ment will be a use­ful ref­er­ence for other coun­tries and re­gions that have con­trolled the epi­demic and are con­tem­plat­ing open­ing their bor­ders.</p>
    <p>The air travel bub­ble was first an­nounced in the mid­dle of last month, to al­low peo­ple to travel be­tween the two lo­ca­tions with­out the need to be quar­an­tined, but sub­ject to con­di­tions such as test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong is the 10th place that Sin­ga­pore has made spe­cial travel ar­range­ments with.</p>
    <p>Apart from air travel bub­bles, other schemes in place in­clude bi­lat­eral green lane ar­range­ments, which are for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel.</p>
    <p>Uni­lat­eral bor­der open­ings, which are one-sided, also safely lift Sin­ga­pore’s bor­der re­stric­tions and wel­come trav­ellers from cer­tain coun­tries and re­gions.</p>
    <p>1 Who is eli­gi­ble?</p>
    <p>• Any per­son who has re­mained in ei­ther Sin­ga­pore or Hong Kong for the last 14 con­sec­u­tive days. This does not in­clude work per­mit and S-Pass hold­ers work­ing in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine ship­yard or process sec­tors in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>2 What flights are avail­able?</p>
    <p>• Trav­ellers from both cities must use the flights des­ig­nated for ATB trav­ellers. The flight num­bers are SQ890, SQ891, CX734 and CX759. From Nov 22, travel will be­gin with one flight a day into each city with a quota of 200 trav­ellers per flight on SQ890 and CX759. The fre­quency will be in­creased to two flights a day into each city with a quota of 200 trav­ellers per flight from Dec 7, with all four flight num­bers run­ning. If the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion de­te­ri­o­rates in ei­ther city, the ATB will be sus­pended.</p>
    <p>3 How will trav­ellers be tested for Covid-19?</p>
    <p>• All trav­ellers will be re­quired to test neg­a­tive on a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) test 72 hours be­fore their sched­uled de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore to Hong Kong</p>
    <p>• Trav­ellers will need to ap­ply for ap­proval to take the PCR test at least seven days be­fore de­par­ture. They will need a con­firmed flight ticket to Hong Kong to ap­ply to take the test. •</p>
    <p>On ap­proval via e-mail, trav­ellers can take their test at a recog­nised clinic or test­ing cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong to Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>• The same 72-hour rule to test neg­a­tive on the</p>
    <p>PCR test ap­plies. Trav­ellers can take the test at recog­nised clin­ics.</p>
    <p>4 What must be done at the des­ti­na­tion city?</p>
    <p>• All trav­ellers ar­riv­ing in Hong Kong are re­quired to take a Covid-19 test on arrival at Hong Kong In­ter­na­tional Air­port (HKIA). They will have to book and pay for their tests be­fore de­part­ing from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>• They must re­main in­side HKIA un­til their re­sults are con­firmed.</p>
    <p>• Trav­ellers can re­fer to Hong Kong’s ded­i­cated ATB web­site for more in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>5 What if trav­ellers fall ill?</p>
    <p>• If trav­ellers be­come in­fected with Covid-19, they will have to bear the full cost of any med­i­cal treat­ment, sub­ject to the poli­cies of the re­spec­tive cities.</p>
    <p>6 What if the rate of in­fec­tion in­creases be­cause of the ATB?</p>
    <p>• If the av­er­age num­ber of daily un­linked cases over a seven-day pe­riod rises to more than five in ei­ther Sin­ga­pore or Hong Kong, the ATB will be sus­pended for two weeks. The ATB will re­sume if the num­ber falls back be­low five on the last day of the sus­pen­sion pe­riod.</p>
