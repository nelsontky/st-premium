    <p>• Ja­panese shares fell yes­ter­day by their most in al­most a month on news that Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe will re­sign, bring­ing an abrupt end to his sta­ble gov­ern­ment and pol­icy mix of ag­gres­sive mon­e­tary and fis­cal stim­u­lus dubbed Abe­nomics. The Nikkei share av­er­age sank 2.65 per cent at one point be­fore clos­ing 1.41 per cent lower at 22,882.65.</p>
    <p>“The Nikkei will likely head to around 21,000, a level where its price-to-book ra­tio will be 1.0,” said Mr Takatoshi Itoshima, a strate­gist at Pictet As­set Man­age­ment. “Ja­panese stocks tend to do well un­der a long, sta­ble gov­ern­ment and that was es­pe­cially the case for Abe. For­eign in­vestors may also worry what will hap­pen to the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the gov­ern­ment and the Bank of Ja­pan (BOJ).”</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, Ja­pan’s long­est serv­ing premier, an­nounced af­ter Tokyo mar­kets closed that he would re­sign due to his wors­en­ing health af­ter al­most eight years in the of­fice, con­firm­ing ear­lier me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>His ag­gres­sive stim­u­lus and close col­lab­o­ra­tion with the cen­tral bank have helped to re­vi­talise Ja­panese shares, with the Nikkei reach­ing a 27-year high in 2018.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket has re­bounded a bit for now, but I think we need to be cau­tious, go­ing into next week,” said Mr Shingo Ide, chief eq­uity strate­gist at NLI Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“Who­ever suc­ceeds him, it will be tough to gar­ner strong sup­port and po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties will likely weigh on mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>The broader Topix lost 0.68 per cent to 1,604.87, with turnover ris­ing to a more than two-month high of 2.83 tril­lion yen (S$40 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The yen, con­sid­ered a safe haven in times of un­cer­tainty, ral­lied against the US dol­lar. The cur­rency, which had fallen to a two-week low of 106.945 to the dol­lar, rose on the news to as strong as 106.025 at 0717 GMT (3.17pm Sin­ga­pore time). By 0735 GMT, it had eased slightly to 106.06.</p>
    <p>“Res­ig­na­tion brings into ques­tion sup­port for Abe­nomics and, of course, sup­port for BOJ gov­er­nor Haruhiko Kuroda’s ul­tra-easy pol­icy,” said Mr Ro­drigo Ca­tril, se­nior for­eign ex­change strate­gist at Na­tional Aus­tralia Bank i n Syd­ney, who sees the yen at 103 against the dol­lar by year-end.</p>
    <p>ING strate­gists wrote in a note to clients that “Abe­nomics” was one of the key fac­tors in yen weak­ness in pre­vi­ous years. But, they said, what mat­ters most for the yen is the BOJ’s stance and that it is too early to say whether Mr Abe’s res­ig­na­tion would ma­te­ri­ally im­pact the cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>“None­the­less, con­cerns about the post-Abe shift in the pol­icy stance add to our bear­ish US dol­lar to yen out­look (we tar­get 102 by year-end), though we con­tinue to see dol­lar weak­ness as the main driver of the cross,” ING added.</p>
    <p>At the vir­tual Jack­son Hole con­fer­ence on Thurs­day, Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Jerome Pow­ell said the United States cen­tral bank would seek to keep in­fla­tion at 2 per cent, on av­er­age, so that pe­ri­ods of too-low in­fla­tion would likely be fol­lowed by an ef­fort to lift in­fla­tion above 2 per cent for some time. In prac­tice, mar­ket par­tic­i­pants expect that this means the cur­rent ul­tra-low US rates will stay lower for longer.</p>
    <p>The dol­lar fell to as low as 92.418 ver­sus a bas­ket of cur­ren­cies while Mr Pow­ell was speak­ing, then quickly re­cov­ered. But it started to slide again overnight, ex­tend­ing losses in early Lon­don trad­ing.</p>
    <p>At 0726 GMT, the dol­lar in­dex was at 92.477, down 0.6 per cent on the day and al­most as low as it was in the ini­tial sell-off on Thurs­day.</p>
