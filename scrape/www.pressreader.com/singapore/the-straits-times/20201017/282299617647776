    <p>• Hous­ton Rock­ets gen­eral man­ager Daryl Morey, whose tweet last year sup­port­ing Hong Kong free­dom led to a China rift with the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA), is step­ping down.</p>
    <p>He is leav­ing on his own ac­cord af­ter guid­ing the Rock­ets bas­ket­ball op­er­a­tions since the 2007-2008 sea­son, mak­ing the de­ci­sion af­ter the Hous­ton were beaten in the sec­ond round of the NBA play-offs in the Covid-19 bub­ble in Or­lando.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter re­turn­ing from Or­lando and re­flect­ing on what has been an amaz­ing 14 years with the Hous­ton Rock­ets... I’ve de­cided I’ll be step­ping away from the Rock­ets or­gan­i­sa­tion ef­fec­tive Novem­ber 1,” Morey said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>His fi­nal cam­paign brought se­vere scru­tiny, af­ter a tweet one year ago re­gard­ing Hong Kong protests that led to China sus­pend­ing spon­sor­ship deals with the NBA and pulling NBA game tele­casts off Chi­nese tele­vi­sion for a year, re­sum­ing only with last Fri­day’s fifth game of the NBA Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>NBA com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver and Hous­ton Rock­ets owner Til­man Fer­titta both backed Morey, the 2018 NBA Ex­ec­u­tive of the Year, de­spite Chi­nese calls for his dis­missal and what Sil­ver es­ti­mated were fi­nan­cial losses to the NBA of about US$400 mil­lion (S$543 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Rock­ets were elim­i­nated in the Western Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals by even­tual cham­pi­ons the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, Morey ap­proached Fer­titta about leav­ing and an exit deal was com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old, who signed a five-year ex­ten­sion in March last year, re­mains to the end of this month to help the Rock­ets com­plete their search for a new coach.</p>
    <p>Separately, Ty­ronn Lue, who coached the Cleve­land Cava­liers to the 2016 NBA ti­tle, has agreed to be­come the next head coach of the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers, ac­cord­ing to mul­ti­ple re­ports on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>ESPN and USA To­day re­ported that Lue has agreed to re­place Doc Rivers, who parted ways with the Clip­pers just over two weeks ago, with ESPN say­ing the deal was for five years.</p>
    <p>Lue, 43, served as the lead as­sis­tant coach for the Clip­pers the past sea­son, when they lost to Den­ver in the Western semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>The Clip­pers have never reached a con­fer­ence fi­nal but, with Kawhi Leonard and Paul Ge­orge lead­ing a tal­ented squad, they are seen as con­tenders next sea­son.</p>
