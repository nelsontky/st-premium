    <p>Ms Joanne Ho con­ducted all her meet­ings over the Zoom video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form dur­ing the circuit breaker from April 7 to June 1, when the au­thor­i­ties shut down schools and some busi­ness op­er­a­tions to stem the rise of Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Even though busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties have now re­sumed, the 47-year-old still holds many of her busi­ness meet­ings on­line.</p>
    <p>“It is better to err on the side of cau­tion and do video meet­ings so as to min­imise the risk of (Covid-19) in­fec­tion,” says Ms Ho, who owns a pub­lic re­la­tions and mar­ket­ing agency.</p>
    <p>She is among what is now a large group of peo­ple de­pen­dent on these video-con­fer­enc­ing tools to conduct busi­ness from day to day as Sin­ga­pore pre­pares for a long fight against the spread of the coro­n­avirus disease.</p>
    <p>And demand for con­fer­enc­ing tools such as Zoom, Skype, Google Meet, Mi­crosoft Teams and Cisco We­bEx does not look like a pass­ing fad. An­a­lysts, busi­nesses and ven­dors tell The Straits Times that video con­fer­enc­ing is here to stay even in the post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>Ms Joanna Lim, Mi­crosoft Sin­ga­pore’s mod­ern work­place lead, says: “We fore­see that video con­fer­enc­ing will still play a big part in daily busi­ness and per­sonal set­tings in the post-pan­demic era, as the work­force adopts a hy­brid ap­proach in the fu­ture of work.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tang Weng Sing, 48, vice-pres­i­dent of a multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tion, says: “The younger gen­er­a­tion’s ex­pec­ta­tions of some sort of work-from-home ar­range­ments will be the norm in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>And com­pa­nies will pro­vide this flex­i­bil­ity to at­tract top tal­ent, he adds.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar­ity of video-con­fer­enc­ing tools has surged since the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can net­work­ing com­pany Cisco’s We­bEx video-con­fer­enc­ing app logged nearly 26 bil­lion meet­ing min­utes in May glob­ally, up from seven bil­lion in Fe­bru­ary this year, ac­cord­ing to Mr Har­i­ha­ran S., Cisco’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of col­lab­o­ra­tion, Asia-Pa­cific, Ja­pan and China.</p>
    <p>“In Sin­ga­pore, we have seen a sim­i­lar trend, with meet­ing min­utes grow­ing three times since the Gov­ern­ment ad­vised on work­ing from home be­ing the de­fault op­tion,” he says.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mo­bile data and an­a­lyt­ics com­pany App An­nie, the time spent on busi­ness and video­con­fer­enc­ing apps grew nearly four times in Sin­ga­pore in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year, com­pared with the first quar­ter of last year.</p>
    <p>App An­nie’s se­nior in­sights man­ager Lexi Sy­dow says video­con­fer­enc­ing tools are no longer con­fined to busi­ness uses.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion col­lab­o­ra­tions and vir­tual live per­for­mances have also in­creas­ingly gone on­line.</p>
    <p>“As peo­ple face un­cer­tain time­lines for the length of so­cial iso­la­tion, video-con­fer­enc­ing apps have the po­ten­tial to break down ge­o­log­i­cal bar­ri­ers and fos­ter the abil­ity to work and so­cialise... this wi l l con­tinue well past the pan­demic,” she says.</p>
    <p>The top three busi­ness apps by down­load in Sin­ga­pore and glob­ally in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year are video-con­fer­enc­ing apps Zoom Cloud Meet­ings (first), Google Meet (sec­ond) and Mi­crosoft Teams (third), ac­cord­ing to App An­nie.</p>
    <p>NEW CA­PA­BIL­I­TIES</p>
    <p>Video-con­fer­enc­ing tools have also evolved with new ca­pa­bil­i­ties as their software providers slug it out for mar­ket share in this pop­u­lar space.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Cisco has added a mu­sic mode that op­ti­mises au­dio pro­cess­ing to sup­port vir­tual concerts and mu­sic lessons.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft Teams now fea­tures real-time noise sup­pres­sion to help min­imise dis­tract­ing back­ground noise dur­ing video calls.</p>
    <p>Ven­dors have also been shoring up the se­cu­rity of their apps.</p>
    <p>Google has given meet­ing hosts in­creased con­trols, such as the abil­ity to de­cide if an ejected at­tendee can re­join a meet­ing. Cisco and Zoom have added new se­cu­rity fea­tures such as set­ting most meet­ings to re­quire pass­words by de­fault.</p>
    <p>Zoom has also bol­stered its host con­trols with fea­tures such as the abil­ity to report a user via a se­cu­rity icon and dis­able the abil­ity for par­tic­i­pants to re­name them­selves.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) is an­other new di­rec­tion that video-con­fer­enc­ing apps have taken.</p>
    <p>Mr Har­i­ha­ran says Cisco will be us­ing AI, ma­chine learn­ing, cloud com­put­ing and deep an­a­lyt­ics to re­move te­dious tasks, im­prove the col­lab­o­ra­tion ex­pe­ri­ence and in­crease team pro­duc­tiv­ity for We­bEx.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft’s Ms Lim says the firm will con­tinue to use AI to in­no­vate in the ar­eas of or­gan­i­sa­tion an­a­lyt­ics and em­ployee well-be­ing for Teams.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe Smith, in­ter­na­tional head at Zoom Video Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, says: “Zoom’s use cases ex­ploded overnight as the Covid-19 pan­demic af­fected the world and, in April, we reached 200 mil­lion daily meet­ing par­tic­i­pants, up from 10 mil­lion daily meet­ing par­tic­i­pants in De­cem­ber last year.”</p>
    <p>This led to it ex­pand­ing in Sin­ga­pore and set­ting up a data cen­tre here a month ago. The data cen­tre is Zoom’s first in South-east Asia and brings the num­ber of its data cen­tres glob­ally to 18.</p>
    <p>Mr Rick Harsh­man, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Google Cloud Asia-Pa­cific, says the fu­ture of video con­fer­enc­ing de­pends on how much it can make vir­tual meet­ings “more pro­duc­tive and more human”.</p>
