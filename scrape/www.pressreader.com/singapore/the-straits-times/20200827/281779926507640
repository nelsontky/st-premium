    <p>• The Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group is a Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered com­pany that made global news when it put in a bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>• Its co-founders are Sin­ga­porean cousins Nel­son Loh, 40, and Ter­ence Loh, 42, and Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant Evan­ge­line Shen, 32, also known as Shen Che.</p>
    <p>• The BN Group was formed in June fol­low­ing a merger be­tween the Lohs’ Dorr Group and Ms Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group. The Lohs also bought over pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices firm Ax­ing­ton, a Catal­ist-listed com­pany.</p>
    <p>• The Lohs are the con­trol­ling share­hold­ers of Ax­ing­ton, but not di­rec­tors. Ms Shen, a di­rec­tor, is the non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man. • Ax­ing­ton, for­merly known as Ax­ce­la­sia, sold its core busi­ness in Malaysia to the Tri­cor Group in Hong Kong in April.</p>
    <p>• Un­der the Lohs’ new own­er­ship, Ax­ing­ton is propos­ing to change its name to NETX at an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing to­day. It also in­tends to change its core busi­ness to pro­vid­ing med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness ser­vices, and in­vest­ments in ar­eas like ro­bot­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy. In ad­di­tion, it pro­poses to ac­quire Malaysian med­i­cal equip­ment and med­i­cal aes­thet­ics prod­ucts dis­trib­u­tor Vesta Apex Trad­ing for $12 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>• Al­though the changes have not been fi­nalised, the BN Group an­nounced the launch of NETX in mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als on July 10. These have since been re­tracted.</p>
    <p>• Last week­end, a BN Group spokesman ad­mit­ted that some pub­lic­ity pho­tos show­ing the Lohs and Ms Shen with for­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama had been doc­tored. On Tues­day, the group said “cer­tain er­rant in­di­vid­u­als, pos­si­bly with ma­li­cious in­tent” were re­spon­si­ble for this. It said it will be ap­point­ing in­de­pen­dent le­gal coun­sel to in­ves­ti­gate the controvers­y.</p>
