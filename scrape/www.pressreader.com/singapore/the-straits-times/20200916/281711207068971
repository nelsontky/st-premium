    <p>United Over­seas Bank is freez­ing the wages of its staff and lim­it­ing hir­ing amid the eco­nomic fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, UOB’s head of group hu­man re­sources Dean Tong said: “As we focus on pro­tect­ing the liveli­hoods of our peo­ple, we are keep­ing salaries at their current lev­els for now and will re­vise our stance as the external en­vi­ron­ment im­proves.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tong told The Straits Times that the bank will take a “dis­ci­plined and se­lec­tive ap­proach to any new head­count increases”, with new ap­point­ments to be “ap­proved at the most se­nior lev­els”.</p>
    <p>He stressed that UOB will con­tinue in­vest­ing in and hir­ing for roles essen­tial to its strate­gic pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said these strate­gic roles in­clude po­si­tions in ar­eas such as tech­nol­ogy and data an­a­lyt­ics, as well as com­mer­cial and cor­po­rate banking.</p>
    <p>Other banks in­di­cated that they may take steps to keep a lid on costs.</p>
    <p>A DBS Bank spokesman said the bank is fac­ing sig­nif­i­cant in­come and credit cost head­winds as the external en­vi­ron­ment con­tin­ues to be chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have been pru­dent on ex­penses, (and this) has in­volved pri­ori­tis­ing in­vest­ments as well as cut­ting back on vari­able staff com­pen­sa­tion. These mea­sures may not be suf­fi­cient. We will cal­i­brate any fur­ther re­sponses in the next few months,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of hu­man re­source plan­ning Jac­inta Low said the bank wants to con­tinue recog­nis­ing staff’s ef­forts, but em­ploy­ees also un­der­stand the need to be pru­dent in man­ag­ing ex­penses and cut­ting costs. “As the fi­nan­cial year has not come to an end, we will re­view the com­pen­sa­tion and re­wards at a later date.”</p>
    <p>UOB has a work­force of more than 26,000 em­ploy­ees across the group. It op­er­ates in 19 mar­kets, in­clud­ing China, Hong Kong, Thai­land and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“Given the trans­for­ma­tional times we are in, we re­main com­mit­ted to see­ing our peo­ple through to bet­ter times and will con­tinue to in­vest in their reskilling and up­skilling. This will en­sure that our peo­ple, and the bank, will emerge stronger when these dif­fi­cult days are over,” Mr Tong said.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­nal memo, the bank told se­nior staff that it ex­pects the</p>
    <p>FLUID SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>sit­u­a­tion to worsen be­fore im­prov­ing when the Gov­ern­ment cuts some of its sup­port, re­ported Bloomberg yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Salary increases and pro­mo­tions will be put on hold un­til fur­ther no­tice, Bloomberg quoted the memo as say­ing. It re­ported that the hir­ing re­stric­tions will last un­til De­cem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>“We will re­view these dy­nam­i­cally, as and when the sit­u­a­tion im­proves,” the memo added. It was sent on be­half of Mr Tong, head of group strat­egy and trans­for­ma­tion Fed­erico Bur­goni and group chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Lee Wai Fai, said Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s third-largest bank posted a 40 per cent fall in sec­ondquar­ter net profit to $703 mil­lion due to weaker in­come and a surge in pro­vi­sions set aside for the eas­ing of loan mora­to­ria, UOB chief ex­ec­u­tive Wee Ee Cheong said last month. This was weaker than the con­sen­sus fore­cast of $815 mil­lion in net in­come es­ti­mated by four an­a­lysts in a Bloomberg poll.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence banking an­a­lyst Dik­sha Gera said in a re­port yes­ter­day that UOB’s move poses risks to div­i­dend pay­out this year as the lender’s prof­its could fall more than 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>“UOB’s higher ex­po­sure to small busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore raises its vul­ner­a­bil­ity ver­sus peers DBS and OCBC,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, lo­cal banks DBS, OCBC and UOB pledged not to cut jobs. DBS com­mit­ted to hir­ing around 2,000 peo­ple here this year in ex­ist­ing and new roles, while OCBC said it would re­cruit 3,000 peo­ple in full-time po­si­tions, trainee­ships and in­tern­ships.</p>
    <p>Al­though it is slow­ing hir­ing, UOB told ST yes­ter­day it is of­fer­ing 320 trainee­ships in over 10 busi­ness and sup­port units across the bank for its op­er­a­tional needs and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and in­no­va­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>As we focus on pro­tect­ing the liveli­hoods of our peo­ple, we are keep­ing salaries at their current lev­els for now and will re­vise our stance as the external en­vi­ron­ment im­proves.</p>
