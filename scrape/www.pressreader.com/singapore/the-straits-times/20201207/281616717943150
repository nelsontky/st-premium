    <p>Of­fices have been hol­lowed out this year with peo­ple switch­ing to work­ing from home dur­ing the pan­demic, but some firms are still forg­ing ahead with plans for new and big­ger phys­i­cal workspaces.</p>
    <p>Gam­ing firm Razer, UBS bank, ride-hail­ing firm Grab and food de­liv­ery provider Foodpanda are among those who re­main com­mit­ted to moving into new of­fices in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>With the coro­n­avirus out­break and the mea­sures to curb it dis­rupt­ing con­struc­tion for months, some of these firms have seen com­ple­tion of their new of­fices de­layed.</p>
    <p>Razer’s new South-east Asia head­quar­ters, for in­stance, was tar­geted for com­ple­tion this year. This has been pushed back due to pan­demic-re­lated de­lays, chief of staff Pa­tri­cia Liu told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The new head­quar­ters is now on track to be ready by the first quar­ter of next year, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Liu added that con­struc­tion on the build­ing had been halted dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and fol­low­ing the start of phase one in June, and that ad­di­tional time had been taken to en­sure that safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were ad­hered to. Con­struc­tion has since re­turned to full swing, she said.</p>
    <p>The seven-storey build­ing in one-north, span­ning close to 208,000 sq ft, will in­clude of­fice space, re­search and de­vel­op­ment labs, as well as de­sign stu­dios.</p>
    <p>“It will also in­clude fea­tures to help fa­cil­i­tate seam­less safe en­try mea­sures by pro­mot­ing a con­tact­less ex­pe­ri­ence, such as fa­cial recog­ni­tion ac­cess, tem­per­a­ture scans and au­ton­o­mous guest reg­is­tra­tion func­tions,” Ms Liu said.</p>
    <p>Foodpanda will be moving to the Afro-Asia i-Mark build­ing in Robin­son Road “some time next year”, said Mr Leroy Tan, head of work­place at Foodpanda Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>The firm’s staff are cur­rently work­ing at sep­a­rate lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>“The move, which was planned be­fore the pan­demic, will al­low us to cre­ate a more co­he­sive work­ing en­vi­ron­ment by bring­ing both our re­gional and lo­cal teams to­gether in one lo­ca­tion,” said Mr Tan. No fur­ther details of the new of­fice space were given.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the Asia head­quar­ters for the food de­liv­ery firm, which op­er­ates in 12 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ride-hail­ing firm Grab de­clined to com­ment when con­tacted, but The Straits Times un­der­stands that its new build­ing in one-north in Buona Vista, which was slated for com­ple­tion by the end of this year, has been de­layed by sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion work was on­go­ing when ST vis­ited the site on Nov 29.</p>
    <p>UBS Group’s move to the for­mer Park Mall site at 9 Pe­nang Road from last month is on track, with some 3,000 em­ploy­ees from di­verse de­part­ments based there to en­hance col­lab­o­ra­tion, said a spokesman for the Swiss bank.</p>
    <p>“In a post-Covid-19 world, we an­tic­i­pate that the work­force will adopt a hy­brid model of work­ing in the of­fice and flex­i­ble work-fromhome ar­range­ments,” she said, adding that the move to the Pe­nang Road build­ing will fur­ther pro­mote a cul­ture of ag­ile work­ing.</p>
    <p>The space is also home to UBS Univer­sity in Asia-Pa­cific, which pro­vides train­ing and de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes for its em­ploy­ees across the re­gion and runs on re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ex­perts noted that even though some firms have cho­sen to down­size their workspaces amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, many com­pa­nies still value hav­ing a phys­i­cal of­fice and are con­tin­u­ing to com­mit to leases.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Lam­pard, Cush­man & Wakefield ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor and head of com­mer­cial leas­ing for Sin­ga­pore and re­gional ten­ant rep­re­sen­ta­tion, said that many com­pa­nies were com­pet­ing to sign new leases early this year, but sev­eral of them tem­po­rar­ily stopped ne­go­ti­a­tions when the Covid-19 cri­sis started to un­fold.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, with busi­ness needs not stop­ping and leases ex­pir­ing, many of these groups re­sumed their ne­go­ti­a­tions and fi­nalised new com­mit­ments,” he said, cit­ing Fuji Xerox, Pru­den­tial and Ama­zon as ex­am­ples.</p>
    <p>On­line mar­ket­place gi­ant Ama­zon is re­port­edly tak­ing over three floors at Asia Square Tower 1 early next year.</p>
    <p>Col­liers In­ter­na­tional ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor and head of oc­cu­pier ser­vices Rick Thomas said that tech firms such as Twit­ter and Rackspace Tech­nol­ogy have con­tin­ued to com­mit to of­fice spa­ces here. He added that flex­i­ble workspace play­ers have con­tin­ued to drive de­mand in this area.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, co-work­ing space op­er­a­tor The Great Room will oc­cupy some 37,000 sq ft as the an­chor ten­ant at the new Afro Asia iMark build­ing in Robin­son Road when it is com­pleted by the end of this year, he said. Mean­while, The Ex­ec­u­tive Cen­tre, an­other shared workspace provider, plans to move into the two high­est floors in One Raf­fles Quay North Tower next year, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam­pard said that us­ing cowork­ing spa­ces is one of the op­tions cor­po­rate oc­cu­piers are con­sid­er­ing as a way to hedge against any sud­den changes in man­power and busi­ness goals.</p>
    <p>Col­liers’ Mr Thomas said that while the work-from-home cul­ture is well-re­ceived, hav­ing teams work in sep­a­rate lo­ca­tions does not build cul­ture and makes it dif­fi­cult for new em­ploy­ees to in­te­grate into the firm.</p>
    <p>“The of­fice is here to stay as it re­mains an an­chor for col­lab­o­ra­tion and pro­mo­tion of cor­po­rate cul­ture,” he said.</p>
