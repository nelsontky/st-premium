    <p>Theatre fans can pick from an ar­ray of bilin­gual theatre of­fer­ings on­line this month from vet­eran theatre com­pa­nies forg­ing on de­spite the fi­nan­cial and emo­tional toll of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Toy Fac­tory Pro­duc­tions’ Old Songs Of Red­hill Mar­ket, part of the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil’s (NAC) Sil­ver Arts Fes­ti­val, went live on YouTube last Satur­day. Toy’s artis­tic di­rec­tor Goh Boon Teck, 49, says the show is a “sto­ry­telling con­cert”: “It is a heart­warm­ing gen­tle re­minder for us to live slowly and to still be in­spired by our rich his­tory of the care­free days of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany also pro­duced its first an­i­ma­tion, Tang Xianzu: Re­birthing Of A 400-Year-Old Dream, about the life of the Chi­nese play­wright. The English-lan­guage short film will de­but on Sept 24, Tang’s 440th birth­day, on the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Fes­ti­val of Arts’ on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>An­other vet­eran bilin­gual com­pany, Drama Box, launched its week­long par­tic­i­pa­tory work­shop fes­ti­val Scenes yes­ter­day. Artis­tic di­rec­tor Kok Heng Leun, 53, says the com­pany de­cided in early</p>
    <p>March to go dig­i­tal with the fes­ti­val when it re­alised Covid-19 was go­ing to be a chal­lenge. The third edi­tion of the fes­ti­val, which the com­pany or­gan­ises once ev­ery five years, has be­come an in­cu­ba­tor for it to think about the chal­lenges of art-mak­ing in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Kok says the fes­ti­val ad­dresses a crit­i­cal is­sue: “How do we en­gage peo­ple if we can’t do it in real life?”</p>
    <p>Hence its project The Lit­tle Cook­ing Club That Could, cre­ated by Sin­ga­pore-born, Aus­tralia-based artist Jamie Lewis, which sent a tif­fin to 10 chil­dren and se­niors. Par­tic­i­pants en­joy a meal and cook one for the next par­tic­i­pant while lis­ten­ing to an in­ter­cul­tural con­ver­sa­tion with chil­dren and se­niors in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Kok says: “The tingkat be­comes a premise to talk about ex­change, the food that they sent from one par­tic­i­pant to an­other par­tic­i­pant be­comes a premise to talk about con­nec­tion.”</p>
    <p>For some­thing less cere­bral, au­di­ences can turn to Body X The Cul­prit, a pop­u­lar Man­darin ex­pe­ri­en­tial theatre piece which re­turns for a third stag­ing on the video plat­form Zoom from to­mor­row to Sun­day. Pro­duced by Danny Yeo, the work in­vites au­di­ences to help solve the cold case of a cof­feeshop pa­tron found dead some 35 years ago.</p>
    <p>Yeo, 47, says he was mo­ti­vated to restage the work, which sold out two pre­vi­ous runs at the Arts House in 2014 and 2016, to pro­vide work for free­lance theatre prac­ti­tion­ers. His co-di­rec­tor and co-cre­ator Li Xie as well as orig­i­nal cast mem­bers in­clud­ing Alvin Chiam, Doreen Toh and Judy Ngo re­turn for this in­stall­ment.</p>
    <p>While the pro­duc­tion has of­fered some work, Yeo says the $20,000 Dig­i­tal Pre­sen­ta­tion Grant from the NAC can­not cover the cost of the pro­duc­tion. He breaks down the num­bers: 20 peo­ple work­ing on the pro­duc­tion over three months means each re­ceives just about $333 a month for their ef­forts. He says: “As a pro­ducer, I feel sad I can’t pro­vide more yet I’m ask­ing them to do more.”</p>
    <p>He hopes ticket sales will help but thus far, the pro­duc­tion has sold about 400 tick­ets whereas in pre­vi­ous years they would have hit 600 to 800. He reck­ons he will have to chip in for the cost of the pro­duc­tion, which in pre­vi­ous years cost about $70,000 to stage.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence has forced him to think se­ri­ously about quit­ting theatre de­spite his pas­sion for the form.</p>
    <p>“To put in all that ef­fort and fac­ing all the chal­lenges, you really think it’s not worth fight­ing. If not for the ca­ma­raderie,” Yeo says, his voice trail­ing off as he be­comes vis­i­bly emo­tional.</p>
    <p>English lan­guage com­pa­nies dom­i­nate the theatre scene here, and bilin­gual theatre prac­ti­tion­ers have to fight harder for spon­sor­ship as well as au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>The Theatre Prac­tice, founded by theatre doyen Kuo Pao Kun and now headed by his daugh­ter Kuo Jian Hong, is cel­e­brat­ing its 55th an­niver­sary later this year with a 55-hour live stream from Nov 27.</p>
    <p>Kuo Jian Hong says: “We’ll be re­vis­it­ing old mem­o­ries, relook­ing at some of our most sem­i­nal works and, most im­por­tantly, bring­ing to­gether all our old and new friends of Prac­tice.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­cently con­cluded its M1 Patch! Theatre fes­ti­val, most of which was con­ducted on­line, and is al­ready plan­ning next year’s edi­tion. She is heart­ened by the healthy view­er­ship of the dig­i­tal events, which were sold out for small shows and drew an av­er­age of 100 screens for larger shows. While she ad­mits “at this point, it’s hard to know def­i­nitely if we have gained new au­di­ences”, she chooses to look on the bright side: “Go­ing be­yond phys­i­cal spa­ces means we are able to reach au­di­ences from all over the world.”</p>
    <p>Smaller groups such as The Finger Play­ers are fo­cus­ing on other work be­yond the the­atri­cal. Play­ers’ co-artis­tic di­rec­tor El­li­son Yuyang says the com­pany “made a con­scious choice” not to stream its archived shows on­line. In­stead it has re­vamped its web­site and is work­ing on an au­dio adap­ta­tion of Turn By Turn We Turn, which won the 2012 Life Theatre Awards for Pro­duc­tion of the Year and Best Di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>She says: “While we are relook­ing at new ways to con­tinue creat­ing, we are also wor­ried about the in­dus­try and its po­ten­tial tal­ent drain due to lack of in­come.”</p>
    <p>Bat­tle-scarred vet­er­ans Goh and Kok are more san­guine, how­ever, hav­ing both sur­vived crip­pling debts and the 2003 Sars cri­sis. Kok says the lat­ter was more chal­leng­ing be­cause “we were younger and we had less re­sources”.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is chal­leng­ing be­cause of its pro­longed im­pact and he fore­sees more dam­age be­fore it is done. Nonethe­less, he sees cause for hope, es­pe­cially in the way the arts com­mu­nity has come to­gether to help each other out.</p>
    <p>“I look for­ward to five, 10 years later when we make art work about this ex­pe­ri­ence. We may cre­ate some­thing very dif­fer­ent.”</p>
