    <p>Pet own­ers in Sin­ga­pore will ben­e­fit from a new set of vac­ci­na­tion guide­lines to help keep their cats and dogs healthy.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Vac­ci­na­tion Guide­lines for Dogs and Cats 2020 were an­nounced by Min­is­ter of State for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Tan Kiat How in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said there was a need to vac­ci­nate pets, and added: “(The new guide­lines) are backed by ro­bust sci­en­tific ev­i­dence, and show the im­por­tance of vac­ci­na­tion for our com­pan­ion an­i­mals to help them ac­quire the im­mu­nity to fight off or de­fend against vac­cinepre­ventable dis­eases.”</p>
    <p>Jointly pro­duced by the Na­tional Parks Board’s (NParks) Animal and Ve­teri­nary Ser­vice (AVS) and the Sin­ga­pore Ve­teri­nary As­so­ci­a­tion, the guide­lines aim to level up the health­care stan­dards for pet cats and dogs, in the face of in­creas­ing pet own­er­ship and in­creased pet move­ment across borders.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to sta­tis­tics pub­lished in the guide­lines, the pop­u­la­tion of owned pets in Sin­ga­pore has surged over the years, with the num­ber of li­censed dogs up by al­most 20 per cent, from 59,000 in 2011 to about 70,000 last year. About 2,000 pets were im­ported in 2018.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines come at a time when con­cerns over animal-to-hu­man dis­ease trans­mis­sion are high due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which orig­i­nated in animal vec­tors be­fore jump­ing to hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Dr Yap Him Hoo, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of NParks AVS, said yes­ter­day: “It is also im­por­tant to recog­nise that animal health is closely linked to public health, and that the pre­ven­tion of zoonotic dis­ease in an­i­mals will greatly re­duce the risk of dis­ease spread to hu­mans.”</p>
    <p>Vet­eri­nar­i­ans said that the launch will help bet­ter in­form the public about vac­ci­na­tions, which is cru­cial given that in­creas­ing num­bers of pet own­ers are op­posed to vac­cines (anti-vaxxers).</p>
    <p>Dr Ar­man Chen, a 36-year-old ve­teri­nary sur­geon and prac­tice man­ager at Gaia Ve­teri­nary Cen­tre, said: “In the past three to four years, I have in­creas­ingly had to deal with clients who are an­ti­vaxxers. In­stead of re­fer­ring them to sources they are un­fa­mil­iar with, I can now cite an author­ity that the public re­spects.”</p>
    <p>Vet­eri­nar­i­ans also said that the new rules will have a con­crete im­pact on the well-be­ing of pets in shel­ters, where many an­i­mals are in close con­tact and dis­eases can spread eas­ily. A locum vet­eri­nar­ian at the So­ci­ety for the Pre­ven­tion of Cru­elty to An­i­mals, Dr Chow Haot­ing, 31, said: “Over the past few years, we’ve had a few dis­ease out­break clus­ters in var­i­ous shel­ters that a proper vac­cine sched­ule could have pre­vented.”</p>
    <p>While wel­com­ing the new guide­lines, Dr Chen rec­om­mended that mea­sures be in­tro­duced for pet eu­thana­sia as well.</p>
    <p>He said that clear guide­lines will help min­imise dis­putes with the public, of the kind that hap­pened with the con­tro­ver­sial eu­thani­sa­tion of Loki, a pet dog whose death on April 20 sparked public out­rage and a four-month-long in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the AVS. “Guide­lines for this con­tro­ver­sial area will show the layper­son how we make our de­ci­sions,” said Dr Chen.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to recog­nise that animal health is closely linked to public health, and that the pre­ven­tion of zoonotic dis­ease in an­i­mals will greatly re­duce the risk of dis­ease spread to hu­mans.</p>
