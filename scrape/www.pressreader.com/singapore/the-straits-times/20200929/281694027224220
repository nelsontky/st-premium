    <p>WUHAN As the coro­n­avirus claimed its mil­lionth life, peo­ple in Wuhan ex­pressed sad­ness yes­ter­day at the con­tin­u­ing global im­pact of the pan­demic – more than nine months af­ter it emerged in the cen­tral Chi­nese city.</p>
    <p>Pride at the city’s re­silience in the face of the calamity is tinged with sad­ness at the mount­ing death toll else­where.</p>
    <p>“One mil­lion peo­ple dead, maybe rel­a­tively speak­ing in terms of the to­tal global pop­u­la­tion it’s not a lot,” said Mr Hu Lingquan, a sci­en­tist and Wuhan res­i­dent. “But these are ac­tu­ally all real peo­ple’s lives... Ev­ery per­son has a fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Chil­dren clasped their par­ents’ hands as they nav­i­gated their way to school yes­ter­day through rush­hour traf­fic in the city that is now nearly en­tirely back to busi­ness as usual.</p>
    <p>As the global death toll hit one mil­lion – and with re­sis­tance to the threat of new lock­downs build­ing from Lon­don to Madrid to Mel­bourne – China has been cel­e­brat­ing its emer­gence from the virus.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy is bounc­ing back, with fac­to­ries re­opened and con­sumers re­turn­ing to shops – the epi­demic smoth­ered by months of strictly en­forced blan­ket lock­downs as well as mass test­ing and con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Wuhan, the cen­tral Chi­nese city and ground zero of the virus, has flaunted its re­bound with packed pool par­ties and bustling amuse­ment parks.</p>
    <p>But those op­tics have played badly across a world still strug­gling to con­trol the virus spread and eco­nomic fall­out, while de­mand­ing ac­count­abil­ity from China for the causes of the out­break.</p>
    <p>The virus was felt sharply in the city of 11 mil­lion with 50,340 con­firmed cases and 3,869 deaths – the most in­fec­tions and fa­tal­i­ties in China.</p>
    <p>But there have been no new cases in the city since May, and many in Wuhan now ques­tion the global re­sponse to a pan­demic which China ap­pears to have suc­cess­fully sti­fled for now.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also stirred doubt into the Wuhan out­break ori­gin story, prod­ding out­rage from worst-hit na­tions, led by United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump who refers to the disease as the “China virus”.</p>
    <p>“From China’s point of view they’ve re­ally done badly,” said Mr Hu. “Maybe they never re­ally com­pre­hended how se­ri­ous this thing is.”</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion warns the toll will keep ris­ing un­til an ef­fec­tive vac­cine is found and dis­trib­uted glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“When the out­break be­gan, I didn’t imag­ine the death toll could be this high,” Wuhan res­i­dent Guo Jing said. “It has ex­ceeded a lot of peo­ple’s ex­pec­ta­tions, and it con­tin­ues to rise.”</p>
    <p>But in the city whose name is now syn­ony­mous with the virus, time has seen fo­cus drift.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, face masks hung from the chins of sev­eral pedes­tri­ans – rather than cov­er­ing mouths and noses – while shop­pers thronged Wuhan’s com­mer­cial dis­tricts ahead of a hol­i­day week.</p>
    <p>“Wuhan has restarted,” me­dia worker An An said. “Life has re­turned to the kind of flavour we had be­fore. Ev­ery­one liv­ing in Wuhan feels at ease.”</p>
